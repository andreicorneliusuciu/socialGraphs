Although the neutron has no net electric charge, it does have a slight distribution of charge within it. With its positive electric charge, the proton is directly influenced by [[electric fields]], whereas the response of the neutron to this force is much weaker.\n\nA free neutron is unstable, decaying to a proton, electron and [[antineutrino]] with a [[mean lifetime]] of just under 15 minutes ({{val|881.5|1.5|u=s}}). This [[radioactive decay]], known as [[beta decay]],<ref name=\"RPP\"/> is possible since the mass of the neutron is slightly greater than the proton. The free proton is stable. Neutrons or protons bound in a nucleus can be stable or unstable, however, depending on the [[nuclide]]. Beta decay, in which neutrons decay to protons, or vice versa, is governed by the [[weak interaction|weak force]], and it requires the emission or absorption of electrons and neutrinos, or their antiparticles.\n\n[[File:Nuclear fission.svg|thumb|150px|right|Nuclear fission caused by absorption of a neutron by uranium-235. The heavy nuclide fragments into lighter components and additional neutrons.]]\nProtons and neutrons behave almost identically under the influence of the nuclear force within the nucleus. The concept of [[isospin]], in which the proton and neutron are viewed as two quantum states of the same particle, is used to model the interactions of nucleons by the nuclear or weak forces. Because of the strength of the nuclear force at short distances, the [[binding energy]] of nucleons is more than seven orders of magnitude larger than the electromagnetic energy binding electrons in atoms. [[Nuclear reaction]]s (such as [[nuclear fission]]) therefore have an [[energy density]] that is more than ten million times that of [[chemical reaction]]s. Because of the [[mass\u2013energy equivalence]], nuclear binding energies add or subtract from the mass of nuclei. Ultimately, the ability of the nuclear force to store energy arising from the electromagnetic repulsion of nuclear components is the basis for most of the energy that makes nuclear reactors or bombs possible. In nuclear fission, the absorption of a neutron by a heavy nuclide (e.g., [[uranium-235]]) causes the nuclide to become unstable and break into light nuclides and additional neutrons. The positively charged light nuclides then repel, releasing electromagnetic [[potential energy]].\n\nThe neutron is classified as a [[hadron]], since it is composed of [[quark]]s, and as a [[baryon]], since it is composed of three quarks.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |author=Adair, R.K. \n |year=1989\n |title=The Great Design: Particles, Fields, and Creation\n |page=214\n |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]\n |isbn=\n}}</ref> The finite size of the neutron and its magnetic moment indicate the neutron is a composite, rather than elementary, particle.

Internal bremsstrahlung gamma ray production is also a minor feature of beta decays of bound neutrons (as discussed below).\n[[Image:Beta-minus Decay.svg|thumb|360px| A [[schematic]] of the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus of an atom]] indicating {{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}} radiation, the emission of a fast electron from the nucleus (the accompanying antineutrino is omitted). In the Rutherford model for the nucleus, red spheres were protons with positive charge and blue spheres were protons tightly bound to an electron with no net charge.<br>\nThe '''inset''' shows beta decay of a free neutron as it is understood today; an electron and antineutrino are created in this process.]]\nA very small minority of neutron decays (about four per million) are so-called \"two-body (neutron) decays\", in which a proton, electron and antineutrino are produced as usual, but the electron fails to gain the 13.6 eV necessary energy to escape the proton (the [[ionization energy]] of [[hydrogen]]), and therefore simply remains bound to it, as a neutral [[hydrogen atom]] (one of the \"two bodies\"). In this type of free neutron decay, in essence all of the neutron [[decay energy]] is carried off by the antineutrino (the other \"body\").\n\nThe transformation of a free proton to a neutron (plus a positron and a neutrino) is energetically impossible, since a free neutron has a greater mass than a free proton.\n\n=== Bound neutron decay ===\n{{Main article|Atomic nucleus}}\nWhile a free neutron has a half life of about 10.2 min, most neutrons within nuclei are stable. According to the [[nuclear shell model]], the protons and neutrons of a [[nuclide]] are a [[Basic quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical system]] organized into discrete [[energy level]]s with unique [[quantum numbers]]. For a neutron to decay, the resulting proton requires an available state at lower energy than the initial neutron state. In stable nuclei the possible lower energy states are all filled, meaning they are each occupied by two protons with [[Spin (physics)|spin]] up and spin down. The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] therefore disallows the decay of a neutron to a proton within stable nuclei. The situation is similar to electrons of an atom, where electrons have distinct [[atomic orbital]]s and are prevented from decaying to lower energy states, with the emission of a [[photon]], by the exclusion principle.\n\nNeutrons in unstable nuclei can decay by [[beta decay]] as described above. In this case, an energetically allowed quantum state is available for the proton resulting from the decay. One example of this decay is [[carbon-14]] (6 protons, 8 neutrons) that decays to [[nitrogen-14]] (7 protons, 7 neutrons) with a half-life of about 5,730 years.\n\nInside a nucleus, a proton can transform into a neutron via [[inverse beta decay]], if an energetically allowed quantum state is available for the neutron. This transformation occurs by emission of an [[antielectron]] (also called positron) and an electron [[neutrino]]:\n:{{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Positron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}\n\nThe transformation of a proton to a neutron inside of a nucleus is also possible through [[electron capture]]:\n:{{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}\nPositron capture by neutrons in nuclei that contain an excess of neutrons is also possible, but is hindered because positrons are repelled by the positive nucleus, and quickly [[annihilation|annihilate]] when they encounter electrons.\n\n=== Competition of beta decay types ===\nThree types of beta decay in competition are illustrated by the single isotope [[copper-64]] (29 protons, 35 neutrons), which has a half-life of about 12.7 hours. This isotope has one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron, so either the proton or the neutron can decay. This particular nuclide is almost equally likely to undergo proton decay (by [[positron emission]], 18% or by [[electron capture]], 43%) or neutron decay (by electron emission, 39%).\n\n== Intrinsic properties ==\n\n=== Mass ===\nThe mass of a neutron cannot be directly determined by mass spectrometry due to lack of electric charge. However, since the mass of protons and deuterons can be measured by mass spectrometry, the mass of a neutron can be deduced by subtracting proton mass from deuteron mass, with the difference being the mass of the neutron plus the [[binding energy]] of deuterium (expressed as a positive emitted energy). The latter can be directly measured by measuring the energy (<math>B_d</math>) of the single {{val|0.7822|u=MeV}} gamma photon emitted when neutrons are captured by protons (this is exothermic and happens with zero-energy neutrons), plus the small recoil kinetic energy (<math>E_{rd}</math>) of the deuteron (about 0.06% of the total energy). \n \n:<math>m_n = m_d - m_p + B_d - E_{rd}</math>\n\nThe energy of the gamma ray can be measured to high precision by X-ray diffraction techniques, as was first done by Bell and Elliot in 1948.

It was discovered by [[Bruce Cork]] in the year 1956, a year after the [[antiproton]] was discovered. [[CPT-symmetry]] puts strong constraints on the relative properties of particles and antiparticles, so studying antineutrons yields provide stringent tests on CPT-symmetry. The fractional difference in the masses of the neutron and antineutron is {{val|9|6|e=-5}}. Since the difference is only about two [[standard deviation]]s away from zero, this does not give any convincing evidence of CPT-violation.<ref name=\"RPP\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0954-3899/37/7A/075021|title=Review of Particle Physics|year=2010|last1=Nakamura|first1=K|journal=Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics|volume=37|issue=7A|pages=075021|bibcode = 2010JPhG...37g5021N }} [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2011/listings/rpp2011-list-n.pdf PDF with 2011 partial update for the 2012 edition]\nThe exact value of the mean lifetime is still uncertain, due to conflicting results from experiments.\nThe Particle Data Group reports values up to six seconds apart (more than four standard deviations), commenting that \n\"our 2006, 2008, and 2010 Reviews stayed with 885.7\u00b10.8 s; but we noted that in light of SEREBROV 05 our value should be regarded as suspect until further experiments clarified matters.

Neutrons that elastically scatter off atoms can create an ionization track that is detectable, but the experiments are not as simple to carry out; other means for detecting neutrons, consisting of allowing them to interact with atomic nuclei, are more commonly used. The commonly used methods to detect neutrons can therefore be categorized according to the nuclear processes relied upon, mainly [[neutron capture]] or [[elastic scattering]].<ref>{{cite book|chapter =Ch. 14 |title=Radiation Detection and Measurement|author= Knoll, Glenn F. |publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year= 1979|isbn=047149545X}}</ref>\n\n===Neutron detection by neutron capture===\n\nA common method for detecting neutrons involves converting the energy released from [[neutron capture]] reactions into electrical signals. Certain nuclides have a high neutron capture [[cross section (physics)|cross section]], which is the probability of absorbing a neutron. Upon neutron capture, the compound nucleus emits more easily detectable radiation, for example an alpha particle, which is then detected. The nuclides {{SimpleNuclide|Helium|3}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Lithium|6}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Boron|10}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Uranium|233}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Uranium|235}}, {{SimpleNuclide|Neptunium|237}} and {{SimpleNuclide|Plutonium|239}} are useful for this purpose. <!-- The following needs correction, errors due to lack of reference: These nuclides are rarely found in nature, but can be accumulated through processes such as isotopic enrichment.\n\nThe cross section for the process of neutron capture is much lower at high energies than at low energies. Therefore, the detection of neutrons by neutron capture requires a preceding slowing down of neutrons. For this purpose, a so-called moderator is used, typically a thick slab of polyethylene. Neutron detection according to the moderate-and-capture approach is not capable of measuring neutron energy, precise time of arrival, or direction of incidence, since this information is lost during moderation. -->\n\n===Neutron detection by elastic scattering===\n\nNeutrons can elastically scatter off nuclei, causing the struck nucleus to recoil. Kinematically, a neutron can transfer more energy to light nuclei such as hydrogen or helium than to heavier nuclei. Detectors relying on elastic scattering are called fast neutron detectors. Recoiling nuclei can ionize and excite further atoms through collisions. Charge and/or scintillation light produced in this way can be collected to produce a detected signal. A major challenge in fast neutron detection is discerning such signals from erroneous signals produced by gamma radiation in the same detector.\n\nFast neutron detectors have the advantage of not requiring a moderator, and therefore being capable of measuring the neutron's energy, time of arrival, and in certain cases direction of incidence.\n\n== Sources and production ==\n{{Main article|Neutron source|neutron generator|research reactor}}\nFree neutrons are unstable, although they have the longest half-life of any unstable sub-atomic particle by several orders of magnitude. Their half-life is still only about 10 minutes, however, so they can be obtained only from sources that produce them freshly.\n\n'''Natural neutron background.''' A small natural background flux of free neutrons exists everywhere on Earth. In the atmosphere and deep into the ocean, the \"neutron background\" is caused by [[muon]]s produced by [[cosmic ray]] interaction with the atmosphere. These high energy muons are capable of penetration to considerable depths in water and soil. There, in striking atomic nuclei, among other reactions they induce spallation reactions in which a neutron is liberated from the nucleus. Within the Earth's crust a second source is neutrons produced primarily by spontaneous fission of uranium and thorium present in crustal minerals. The neutron background is not strong enough to be a biological hazard, but it is of importance to very high resolution particle detectors that are looking for very rare events, such as (hypothesized) interactions that might be caused by particles of [[dark matter]].<ref name=\"NatNeu\"/> Recent research has shown that even thunderstorms can produce neutrons with energies of up to several tens of MeV.<ref name=\"KohnEbert\">{{cite journal|last1=K\u00f6hn |first1=C. |last2=Ebert |first2=U. |title=Calculation of beams of positrons, neutrons and protons associated with terrestrial gamma-ray flashes |journal=[[J.

These neutrons not only produce a Martian surface neutron radiation hazard from direct downward-going neutron radiation but may also produce a significant hazard from reflection of neutrons from the Martian surface, which will produce reflected neutron radiation penetrating upward into a Martian craft or habitat from the floor.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clowdsley |url=http://www.physicamedica.com/VOLXVII_S1/20-CLOWDSLEY%20et%20alii.pdf |journal=Physica Medica  |first1=MS |volume=17 |issue=Suppl 1 |last2=Wilson |pages=94\u20136 |first2=JW |last3=Kim |first3=MH |last4=Singleterry |first4=RC |last5=Tripathi |first5=RK |last6=Heinbockel |first6=JH |last7=Badavi |first7=FF |last8=Shinn |first8=JL |title=Neutron Environments on the Martian Surface |year=2001 |pmid=11770546}}</ref>\n\n'''Sources of neutrons for research.''' These include certain types of [[radioactive decay]] ([[spontaneous fission]] and [[neutron emission]]), and from certain [[nuclear reaction]]s. Convenient nuclear reactions include tabletop reactions such as natural alpha and gamma bombardment of certain nuclides, often beryllium or deuterium, and induced [[nuclear fission]], such as occurs in nuclear reactors. In addition, high-energy nuclear reactions (such as occur in cosmic radiation showers or accelerator collisions) also produce neutrons from disintegration of target nuclei. Small (tabletop) [[particle accelerator]]s optimized to produce free neutrons in this way, are called [[neutron generator]]s.\n\nIn practice, the most commonly used small laboratory sources of neutrons use radioactive decay to power neutron production. One noted neutron-producing [[radioisotope]], [[californium]]-252 decays (half-life 2.65 years) by [[spontaneous fission]] 3% of the time with production of 3.7 neutrons per fission, and is used alone as a neutron source from this process. [[Nuclear reaction]] sources (that involve two materials) powered by radioisotopes use an [[alpha decay]] source plus a beryllium target, or else a source of high-energy gamma radiation from a source that undergoes [[beta decay]] followed by [[gamma decay]], which produces photoneutrons on interaction of the high energy [[gamma ray]] with ordinary stable beryllium, or else with the [[deuterium]] in [[heavy water]]. A popular source of the latter type is radioactive [[antimony-124]] plus beryllium, a system with a half-life of 60.9 days, which can be constructed from natural antimony (which is 42.8% stable antimony-123) by activating it with neutrons in a nuclear reactor, then transported to where the neutron source is needed.<ref>Byrne, J.

However, it is these neutrons that possess most of the energy, and converting that energy to a useful form has proved a difficult engineering challenge.

For access to intense neutron sources, researchers must go to a specialist [[neutron facilities|neutron facility]] that operates a [[research reactor]] or a [[spallation]] source.\n\nThe neutron's lack of total electric charge makes it difficult to steer or accelerate them. Charged particles can be accelerated, decelerated, or deflected by [[electric field|electric]] or [[magnetic field]]s. These methods have little effect on neutrons. However, some effects may be attained by use of inhomogeneous magnetic fields because of the [[neutron magnetic moment|neutron's magnetic moment]]. Neutrons can be controlled by methods that include [[neutron moderator|moderation]], [[neutron reflector|reflection]], and [[neutron-velocity selector|velocity selection]]. [[Thermal neutron]]s can be polarized by transmission through [[magnet]]ic materials in a method analogous to the [[Faraday effect]] for [[photon]]s. Cold neutrons of wavelengths of 6\u20137 angstroms can be produced in beams of a high degree of polarization, by use of [[Neutron supermirror|magnetic mirror]]s and magnetized interference filters.<ref>Byrne, J.

For example, neutron capture often results in [[neutron activation]], inducing [[radioactivity]]. In particular, knowledge of neutrons and their behavior has been important in the development of [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s. The [[Nuclear fission|fissioning]] of elements like [[uranium-235]] and [[plutonium-239]] is caused by their absorption of neutrons.\n\n[[neutron temperature|''Cold'', ''thermal'' and ''hot'']] [[neutron radiation]] is commonly employed in [[neutron scattering]] facilities, where the radiation is used in a similar way one uses [[X-ray]]s for the analysis of [[condensed matter]]. Neutrons are complementary to the latter in terms of atomic contrasts by different scattering [[Cross section (physics)|cross sections]]; sensitivity to magnetism; energy range for inelastic neutron spectroscopy; and deep penetration into matter.\n\nThe development of \"neutron lenses\" based on total internal reflection within hollow glass capillary tubes or by reflection from dimpled aluminum plates has driven ongoing research into neutron microscopy and neutron/gamma ray tomography.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kumakhov |first=M. A. |author2=Sharov, V.

NASA.gov (2007-11-30). Retrieved on 2012-08-16.</ref>\n\nA major use of neutrons is to excite delayed and prompt [[gamma ray]]s from elements in materials. This forms the basis of [[neutron activation analysis]] (NAA) and [[prompt gamma neutron activation analysis]] (PGNAA). NAA is most often used to analyze small samples of materials in a [[nuclear reactor]] whilst PGNAA is most often used to analyze subterranean rocks around [[bore hole]]s and industrial bulk materials on conveyor belts.\n\nAnother use of neutron emitters is the detection of light nuclei, in particular the hydrogen found in water molecules. When a fast neutron collides with a light nucleus, it loses a large fraction of its energy. By measuring the rate at which slow neutrons return to the probe after reflecting off of hydrogen nuclei, a [[neutron probe]] may determine the water content in soil.\n\n== Medical therapies ==\n{{Main article|Fast neutron therapy|Neutron capture therapy of cancer}}\n\nBecause neutron radiation is both penetrating and ionizing, it can be exploited for medical treatments. Neutron radiation can have the unfortunate side-effect of leaving the affected area radioactive, however. [[Neutron tomography]] is therefore not a viable medical application.\n\nFast neutron therapy utilizes high energy neutrons typically greater than 20 MeV to treat cancer.  [[Radiation therapy]] of cancers is based upon the biological response of cells to ionizing radiation. If radiation is delivered in small sessions to damage cancerous areas, normal tissue will have time to repair itself, while tumor cells often cannot.<ref>Hall EJ (2000). ''Radiobiology for the Radiologist''. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 5th edition</ref> Neutron radiation can deliver energy to a cancerous region at a rate an order of magnitude larger than [[gamma radiation]]<ref>Johns HE and Cunningham JR (1978). ''The Physics of Radiology''. Charles C Thomas 3rd edition</ref>\n\nBeams of low energy neutrons are used in [[Neutron capture therapy of cancer|boron capture therapy]] to treat cancer. In boron capture therapy, the patient is given a drug that contains boron and that preferentially accumulates in the tumor to be targeted. The tumor is then bombarded with very low energy neutrons (although often higher than thermal energy) which are captured by the [[boron-10]] isotope in the boron, which produces an excited state of boron-11 that then decays to produce [[lithium-7]] and an [[alpha particle]] that have sufficient energy to kill the malignant cell, but insufficient range to damage nearby cells. For such a therapy to be applied to the treatment of cancer, a neutron source having an intensity of the order of billion (10<sup>9</sup>) neutrons per second per cm<sup>2</sup> is preferred. Such fluxes require a research nuclear reactor.\n\n==Protection==\n\nExposure to free neutrons can be hazardous, since the interaction of neutrons with molecules in the body can cause disruption to [[molecule]]s and [[atom]]s, and can also cause reactions that give rise to other forms of [[radiation]] (such as protons). The normal precautions of radiation protection apply: Avoid exposure, stay as far from the source as possible, and keep exposure time to a minimum. Some particular thought must be given to how to protect from neutron exposure, however. For other types of radiation, e.g., [[alpha particle]]s, [[beta particle]]s, or [[gamma ray]]s, material of a high atomic number and with high density make for good shielding; frequently, [[lead]] is used. However, this approach will not work with neutrons, since the absorption of neutrons does not increase straightforwardly with atomic number, as it does with alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. Instead one needs to look at the particular interactions neutrons have with matter (see the section on detection above). For example, [[hydrogen]]-rich materials are often used to shield against neutrons, since ordinary hydrogen both scatters and slows neutrons. This often means that simple concrete blocks or even paraffin-loaded plastic blocks afford better protection from neutrons than do far more dense materials. After slowing, neutrons may then be absorbed with an isotope that has high affinity for slow neutrons without causing secondary capture radiation, such as lithium-6.\n\nHydrogen-rich [[water|ordinary water]] affects neutron absorption in [[nuclear fission]] reactors: Usually, neutrons are so strongly absorbed by normal water that fuel enrichment with fissionable isotope is required.{{clarify|reason=A step of logic is missing here. Are the neutrons needed to make something fission? Why is so much water used if it is too much?|date=May 2015}} The [[deuterium]] in [[heavy water]] has a very much lower absorption affinity for neutrons than does protium (normal light hydrogen). Deuterium is, therefore, used in [[CANDU]]-type reactors, in order to slow ([[Neutron moderator|moderate]]) neutron velocity, to increase the probability of [[nuclear fission]] compared to [[neutron capture]].\n\n== Neutron temperature ==\n{{Main article|Neutron temperature}}\n\n===Thermal neutrons===\n\nA ''thermal neutron'' is a [[free neutron]] that is [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|Boltzmann distributed]] with kT = {{val|0.0253|ul=eV}} ({{val|4.0|e=-21|ul=J}}) at room temperature. This gives characteristic (not average, or median) speed of 2.2&nbsp;km/s. The name 'thermal' comes from their energy being that of the room temperature gas or material they are permeating. (see ''[[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]]'' for energies and speeds of molecules). After a number of collisions (often in the range of 10\u201320) with nuclei, neutrons arrive at this energy level, provided that they are not absorbed.\n\nIn many substances, thermal neutron reactions show a much larger effective cross-section than reactions involving faster neutrons, and thermal neutrons can therefore be absorbed more readily (i.e., with higher probability) by any [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] that they collide with, creating a heavier \u2014 and often [[unstable isotope|unstable]] \u2014 [[isotope]] of the [[chemical element]] as a result.\n\nMost [[nuclear reactor|fission reactors]] use a [[neutron moderator]] to slow down, or ''thermalize'' the neutrons that are emitted by [[nuclear fission]] so that they are more easily captured, causing further fission. Others, called [[fast breeder]] reactors, use fission energy neutrons directly.\n\n===Cold neutrons ===\n\n''Cold neutrons'' are thermal neutrons that have been equilibrated in a very cold substance such as liquid [[deuterium]]. Such a ''cold source'' is placed in the moderator of a research reactor or spallation source. Cold neutrons are particularly valuable for [[neutron scattering]] experiments.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n[[File:Cold Neutron Source.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Cold neutron source providing neutrons at about the temperature of liquid hydrogen]]\n\n===Ultracold neutrons ===\n[[Ultracold neutrons]] are produced by elastically scattering cold neutrons in substances with a temperature of a few kelvins, such as solid [[deuterium]] or superfluid [[helium]]. An alternative production method is the mechanical deceleration of cold neutrons.\n\n===Fission energy neutrons===\n{{main article|nuclear fission}}\n\nA ''fast neutron'' is a free neutron with a kinetic energy level close to {{val|1|ul=MeV}} ({{val|1.6|e=-13|ul=J}}), hence a speed of ~{{val|14000|u=km/s}} (~{{hsp}}5% of the speed of light). They are named ''fission energy'' or ''fast'' neutrons to distinguish them from lower-energy thermal neutrons, and high-energy neutrons produced in cosmic showers or accelerators. Fast neutrons are produced by nuclear processes such as [[nuclear fission]]. Neutrons produced in fission, as noted above, have a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] of kinetic energies from 0 to ~14 MeV, a mean energy of 2 MeV (for U-235 fission neutrons), and a [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of only 0.75 MeV, which means that more than half of them do not qualify as fast (and thus have almost no chance of initiating fission in [[fertile material]]s, such as U-238 and Th-232).\n\nFast neutrons can be made into thermal neutrons via a process called moderation. This is done with a [[neutron moderator]]. In reactors, typically [[heavy water]], [[light water reactor|light water]], or [[graphite]] are used to moderate neutrons.\n\n===Fusion neutrons===\n[[Image:fusion rxnrate.svg|right|300px|thumb|The fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes and then gradually drops off. The DT rate peaks at a lower temperature (about 70&nbsp;keV, or 800 million kelvins) and at a higher value than other reactions commonly considered for fusion energy.]]\n\n{{details|Nuclear fusion#Criteria and candidates for terrestrial reactions}}\n\nD\u2013T ([[deuterium]]\u2013[[tritium]]) fusion is the [[D-T fusion|fusion reaction]] that produces the most energetic neutrons, with 14.1 [[MeV]] of [[kinetic energy]] and traveling at 17% of the [[speed of light]]. D\u2013T fusion is also the easiest fusion reaction to ignite, reaching near-peak rates even when the deuterium and tritium nuclei have only a thousandth as much kinetic energy as the 14.1 MeV that will be produced.\n\n14.1 MeV neutrons have about 10 times as much energy as fission neutrons, and are very effective at fissioning even non-[[fissile]] [[actinides|heavy nuclei]], and these high-energy fissions produce more neutrons on average than fissions by lower-energy neutrons. This makes D\u2013T fusion neutron sources such as proposed [[tokamak]] power reactors useful for [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] of transuranic waste. 14.1 MeV neutrons can also produce neutrons by [[Spallation#Nuclear spallation|knocking them loose from nuclei]].\n\nOn the other hand, these very high energy neutrons are less likely to simply [[neutron capture|be captured without causing fission or spallation]]. For these reasons, [[nuclear weapon design]] extensively utilizes D\u2013T fusion 14.1 MeV neutrons to [[fusion boosting|cause more fission]]. Fusion neutrons are able to cause fission in ordinarily non-fissile materials, such as [[depleted uranium]] (uranium-238), and these materials have been used in the jackets of [[thermonuclear weapon]]s. Fusion neutrons also can cause fission in substances that are unsuitable or difficult to make into primary fission bombs, such as [[reactor grade plutonium]]. This physical fact thus causes ordinary non-weapons grade materials to become of concern in certain [[nuclear proliferation]] discussions and treaties.\n\nOther fusion reactions produce much less energetic neutrons. D\u2013D fusion produces a 2.45 MeV neutron and [[helium-3]] half of the time, and produces [[tritium]] and a proton but no neutron the other half of the time. D\u2013<sup>3</sup>He fusion produces no neutron.\n\n===Intermediate-energy neutrons===\n[[Image:Sasahara.svg|thumb|right|300px|Transmutation flow in [[light water reactor]], which is a thermal-spectrum reactor]]\nA fission energy neutron that has slowed down but not yet reached thermal energies is called an epithermal neutron.\n\n[[Cross section (physics)|Cross sections]] for both [[neutron capture|capture]] and [[nuclear fission|fission]] reactions often have multiple [[resonance]] peaks at specific energies in the epithermal energy range.\nThese are of less significance in a [[fast neutron reactor]], where most neutrons are absorbed before slowing down to this range, or in a well-[[neutron moderator|moderated]] [[thermal reactor]], where epithermal neutrons interact mostly with moderator nuclei, not with either [[fissile]] or [[fertile material|fertile]] [[actinide]] nuclides.\nHowever, in a partially moderated reactor with more interactions of epithermal neutrons with heavy metal nuclei, there are greater possibilities for [[transient state (chemical engineering)|transient]] changes in [[Nuclear chain reaction|reactivity]] that might make reactor control more difficult.\n\nRatios of capture reactions to fission reactions are also worse (more captures without fission) in most [[nuclear fuel]]s such as [[plutonium-239]], making epithermal-spectrum reactors using these fuels less desirable, as captures not only waste the one neutron captured but also usually result in a [[nuclide]] that is not [[fissile]] with thermal or epithermal neutrons, though still [[fissionable]] with fast neutrons. The exception is [[uranium-233]] of the [[thorium cycle]], which has good capture-fission ratios at all neutron energies.\n\n===High-energy neutrons===\n\nThese neutrons have much more energy than fission energy neutrons and are generated as secondary particles by [[particle accelerator]]s or in the atmosphere from [[cosmic ray]]s. These high-energy neutrons are extremely efficient at [[ionization]] and far more likely to cause [[Cell (biology)|cell]] death than [[X-rays]] or protons.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://medicalphysicsweb.org/cws/article/research/34364 | title = Facing up to secondary neutrons | accessdate = 2011-02-08 | author = Freeman, Tami | date = May 23, 2008 | publisher = Medical Physics Web}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = Expand+Overview of secondary neutron production relevant to shielding in space | journal = Radiation Protection Dosimetry | year = 2005| volume = 116 | issue = 1\u20134 | pages = 140\u2013143| doi=10.1093/rpd/nci033 | pmid = 16604615 | last1 = Heilbronn | first1 = L. | last2 = Nakamura | first2 = T | last3 = Iwata | first3 = Y | last4 = Kurosawa | first4 = T | last5 = Iwase | first5 = H | last6 = Townsend | first6 = LW}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [[Ionizing radiation]]\n* [[Isotope]]\n* [[List of particles]]\n* [[Neutronium]]\n* [[Neutron magnetic moment]]\n* [[Neutron radiation]] and the [[Sievert|Sievert radiation scale]]\n* [[Nuclear reaction]]\n* [[Thermal reactor]]\n* [[Nucleosynthesis]]\n**[[Neutron capture nucleosynthesis]]\n**[[R-process]]\n**[[S-process]]\n\n===Neutron sources===\n*[[Neutron generator]]\n*[[Neutron source]]s\n\n===Processes involving neutrons===\n*[[Neutron bomb]]\n*[[Neutron diffraction]]\n*[[Neutron flux]]\n*[[Neutron transport]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* James Byrne, ''Neutrons, Nuclei and Matter: An Exploration of the Physics of Slow Neutrons''.
