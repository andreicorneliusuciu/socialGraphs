Legal liability can arise from various areas of law, such as [[contract]]s, [[tort]] judgments or settlements, [[tax]]es, or fines given by [[Administrative law|government agencies]]. Liabilities may be covered by [[insurance]], although typically insurance covers liability arising from negligent torts rather than intentional wrongs or [[breach of contract]]. Liability may also be imposed{{by whom|date=January 2016}} [[joint and several]]ly in certain cases. Liabilities arising from a contract to borrow money are [[debt]].\n\n* Under [[English law]], with the passing of the [[Theft Act 1978]], it is an offense to evade a liability dishonestly. Payment of [[damages]] usually resolves the liability. [[Vicarious liability]] arises under the common law doctrine of [[Law of agency|agency]] \u2013 ''[[respondeat superior]]'' \u2013 the responsibility of the superior for the acts of their subordinate.\n* In [[commercial law]], [[limited liability]] is a form of business ownership in which [[business]] owners are legally responsible for no more than the amount that they have contributed to a venture. If, for example, a business goes [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]], then an owner with limited liability will not lose unrelated assets such as a personal residence (assuming they do not give [[personal guarantee]]s). This is the standard model for larger businesses, in which a shareholder will only lose the amount invested (in the form of stock value decreasing). (For an explanation, see [[business entity]].)\n* Manufacturer's liability, a legal concept in most countries, reflects the fact that producers have a responsibility not to sell a defective product. See [[product liability]].\n\nEconomists use the term \"legal liability\" to describe the legal-bound obligation to pay debts.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = O'Sullivan\n  | first = Arthur\n  | authorlink = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist)\n  | first2 = Steven M. | last2 = Sheffrin\n  | title = Economics: Principles in Action\n  | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall\n  | date = 2003\n  | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458\n  | pages = 187\n  | isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}\n</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Attribution (law)]]\n* [[Tort]]\n* [[Strict liability]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Legal Liability}}\n[[Category:Debt]]\n[[Category:Legal terminology]]\n[[Category:Public liability]]\n[[Category:Tort law]]"}]}}}}
