Using these interfaces, a third party could integrate with the platform to add functionality.<ref name=\"eisenmann2008\"/> The opposite is a [[closed platform]].\n\nAn open platform does not mean it is [[open source]], however most open platforms have multiple implementations of APIs. For example [[Common Gateway Interface]] (CGI) is implemented by open source [[web server]]s as well as [[Microsoft Internet Information Server]] (IIS). An open platform can consist of software components or modules that are either commercial or open source or both. It can also exist as a part of closed platform, such as CGI, which is an open platform, while many servers that implement CGI also have other [[proprietary software|proprietary parts]] that are not part of the open platform.\n\nAn open platform implies that the vendor allows, and perhaps supports, the ability to do this. Using an open platform a developer could add features or functionality that the platform vendor had not completed or had not conceived of. An open platform allows the developer to change existing functionality, as the specifications are publicly available open standards.\n\nA [[service-oriented architecture]] allows applications, running as services, to be accessed in a distributed computing environment, such as between multiple systems or across the internet. A major focus of Web services is to make functional building blocks accessible over standard Internet protocols that are independent from platforms and programming languages. An open SOA platform would allow anyone to access and interact with these building blocks.\n\nAn 2008 paper from the [[Harvard Business School]] differentiated a platform's openness in four aspects and gave example platforms.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible sortable\"\n!
