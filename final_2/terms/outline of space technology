Space technology includes spacecraft, satellites, space stations, and support infrastructure, equipment, and procedures. Space is such a novel environment that attempting to work in it requires new tools and techniques. Many common everyday services such as [[weather forecasting]], [[remote sensing]], [[GPS]] systems, [[satellite television]], and some long distance communications systems critically rely on space infrastructure. Of the sciences, [[Outline of astronomy|astronomy]] and [[Outline of earth science|Earth science]] (via [[remote sensing]]) benefit from space technology. New technologies originating with or accelerated by space-related endeavors are often subsequently exploited in other economic activities.\n\n== Types of space technologies ==\n\n=== Satellite technology ===\n\n* [[Satellite]]space \n** Types of satellites\n*** [[Communications satellite]]\n**** [[Direct-broadcast satellite]]\n*** [[Earth observation satellite]]\n*** [[Geosynchronous satellite]]\n*** [[Military satellite]]\n**** [[Reconnaissance satellite]]\n*** [[Navigation satellite]]\n*** [[Telecommunications satellite]]\n*** [[Tracking and data relay satellite]]\n*** [[Weather satellite]]\n** Specific satellites\n*** [[List of Earth observation satellites]]\n*** [[List of satellites in geosynchronous orbit]]\n*** [[List of satellites which have provided data on Earth's magnetosphere]]\n* [[Artificial satellite orbit|Satellite orbit]]\n** [[Artificial satellites in retrograde orbit]]\n* Satellite-based services\n** [[Satellite navigation]]\n** [[Satellite radio]]\n** [[Satellite television]]\n\n=== Space exploration technology ===\n* [[Aerobot]] (Planetary probe suspended in atmosphere)\n* [[Lunar rover]]\n* [[Mars rover]]\n* [[Manned space mission]]\n\n=== Space flight technology ===\n\n[[Spaceflight]]\n* [[Ablative heat shield]]\n* [[Aerobraking]]\n* [[Booster (rocketry)]]\n* [[Gantry (rocketry)|Gantry]]\n* [[Reusable launch system]]\u2014the [[Space Shuttle]] and [[X-37]] are partially reusable [[spaceplane]]s; [[SpaceX]] is currently developing a [[SpaceX reusable launch system development program|set of reusable technologies]] to support [[Multistage rocket|booster]] reuse and [[second stage|second-stage]] reuse.<ref name=nsw20130328>\n{{cite news |last=Lindsey|first=Clark |title=SpaceX moving quickly towards fly-back first stage |url=http://www.newspacewatch.com/articles/spacex-moving-quickly-towards-fly-back-first-stage.html |accessdate=2013-03-29 |newspaper=NewSpace Watch |date=2013-04-29 |subscription=yes }}</ref>\n\n== History of space technology ==\n* History of satellite technology\n** [[Timeline of artificial satellites and space probes]]\n*** [[Timeline of Earth science satellites]]\n\n==Future space technologies==\n* [[Asteroid mining]] technology\n* [[Single-stage-to-orbit]]\n* [[Space-based solar power]]\n* [[Non-rocket spacelaunch]]\n* [[Space manufacturing]] technology\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n\n* [[Outline of space exploration]]\n* [[Outline of space science]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{sisterlinks|Space technology}}\n\n* [http://wikimindmap.com/viewmap.php?wiki=en.wikipedia.org&topic=Outline+of+space+technology&Submit=Search This outline displayed as a mindmap], at ''wikimindmap.com''\n* [http://www.race2space.org/ Race2Space.org - Advancing the Privatization of Space Travel 2006], Race2Space, in partnership with the X Prize foundation, is seeking sponsorship in order to support the privatization of space travel, research, and exploration for the upcoming Lunar Landing Challenge Contestants October 2006.\"\n* [http://spacestation-shuttle.blogspot.com/ Space Shuttle] - News and features about NASA research, aimed at the general public.
