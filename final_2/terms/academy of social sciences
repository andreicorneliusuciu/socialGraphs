The Academy promotes social science through its sponsorship of the [[Campaign for Social Science]], its links with Government on a variety of matters, and its own policy work in issuing public comment, responding to official consultations, and organising meetings and events about social science. It confers the title of Fellow upon nominated social scientists following a process of peer review. The Academy comprises over 1000 Fellows and 41 [[Learned society|learned societies]] based in the UK and Europe.\n\n== History and Structure ==\nThe Academy\u2019s origins lie in the formation of a representative body for the social science learned societies in the early 1980s, the Association of Learned Societies in the Social Sciences. From 1999 to 2007 it was called the Academy of Learned Societies for the Social Sciences before changing to its current name.<ref>[http://www.jordanwatch.co.uk/reports/details/03847936/academyofsocialsciences.html JordanWatch.uk], retrieved on 17 March 2010</ref> The Academy is run by a Council of 21 members, with Professor Roger Goodman FAcSS as its current Chair, and Professor Sir [[Ivor Crewe]] FAcSS, Master of [[University College, Oxford]], as its current President. 7 Council members are elected by the Academy\u2019s Fellows, 7 by its Learned Societies and 7 are appointed.<ref>[https://acss.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Academy-of-Social-Sciences-Memorandum-and-Articles-of-Association-amended-March-2013.pdf Academy website]</ref>\n\n== Advocacy ==\nThe Academy advocates social science by interacting with Government and other organisations, and co-ordinates the responses of social scientists to Government consultation documents. Past consultations include:\n\n* Independent Review of Implementation of [[RCUK]] Policy on Open Access.\n* [[Public Administration Select Committee]] Enquiry on 'Building Civil service Skills for the Future'\n* The [[Office for National Statistics]] consultation on the future of the Census <ref>[http://acss.org.uk/publication-category/consultation-responses/ Academy website]</ref>\n\nThe Academy also puts forward suggestions to the Government about which social scientists should carry out its Foresight research projects,<ref>[http://www.bis.gov.uk/foresight/ BIS website]</ref> which look at important issues and how these might change over the next 20 to 80 years.\n\nA developing part of the Academy\u2019s work is to bring researchers and organisations using research closer together to improve the evidence upon which public policy is based and to increase the impact of research.\n\n== Publications and Events ==\nThe Academy has produced a series of [http://acss.org.uk/publication-category/making-the-case/ \u2018Making the Case for the Social Sciences\u2019] booklets which give examples of important social science research which has made a difference to policy or practice. These are: Wellbeing; Ageing; Sustainability; the Environment and Climate Change; Crime; Sport and Leisure; Management; Scotland; Longitudinal Studies, Mental Wellbeing, Wales and Dementia. Further titles are in preparation. The Academy also publishes a cross-disciplinary peer-reviewed journal, [http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rsoc21/current#.Uo34U9K9lA0 ''Contemporary Social Science'']. The Academy holds regular events, such as conferences on the ethics of social media research and the future of the [{Research Excellence Framework]]. It holds an Annual Lecture each summer, and its President's Lunch each winter. It also arranges (with the [[British Library]]) a public lecture series Enduring Ideas.<ref>[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/bldept/socsci/events/socscievents.html]</ref>\n\n== Fellows ==\nPart of the Academy\u2019s work is to recognise social scientists who are held in esteem by their peer group and whose life and work have had an impact in advancing social science. They are nominated and the nominations are then subject to peer review. Fellows are academics, policy-makers and practitioners, and are entitled to use the letters \"FAcSS\" after their name. In November 2014 there were 1000 Fellows, just over 1% of the 90,000 total membership of the 41 learned society members of the Academy.\n\nFellows were previously known as Academicians and used the post-nominal letter \"AcSS\". This was changed in July 2014 to bring the Academy in line with other British [[learned societies]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Academicians now \u2018Fellows of the Academy of Social Sciences\u2019|url=http://acss.org.uk/news/academicians-now-fellows-academy-social-science/|website=News|publisher=Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=4 September 2014|date=4 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Campaign for Social Science ==\nThe Academy launched the [[Campaign for Social Science]] in January 2011 to advocate social science to Government and the general public. The Campaign is self-funded. It has campaigned for the restoration of the post of Government Chief Social Scientific Adviser,<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/mar/19/the-case-for-a-chief-social-scientist Guardian]</ref> promotes social science in the media and on the web, and organises roadshows around the country to emphasise the value and importance of social science.\n\n== Member societies ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Association of Law Teachers]]\n*[[Association for Psychosocial Studies]]\n*[[Association of Social Anthropologists]]\n*[[Association for Tourism in Higher Education]]\n*[[British Accounting & Finance Association]]\n*[[British Association for American Studies]]\n*[[British Association for Applied Linguistics]]\n*[[British Association for International & Comparative Education]]\n*[[British Academy of Management]]\n*[[British Association for Slavonic & East European Studies]]\n*[[British Educational Research Association]]\n*[[British International Studies Association]]\n*[[British Psychological Society]]\n*[[British Sociological Association]]\n*[[British Society of Criminology]]\n*[[British Society of Gerontology]]\n*[[British Society for Population Studies]]\n*[[Council for Hospitality Management Education]]\n*[[Development Studies Association]]\n*[[Economic History Society]]\n*[[European Academy of Occupational Health Psychology]] \n*[[Government Economic Service]]\n*[[Government Social Research]]\n*[[Housing Studies Association]]\n*[[Joint University Council]]\n*[[Leisure Studies Association]]\n*[[Media, Communications & Cultural Studies Association]]\n*[[Political Studies Association]]\n*[[Regional Studies Association]]\n*[[Regional Science Association|Regional Science Association International]]\n*[[Royal Geographical Society]]\n*[[Royal Statistical Society]]\n*[[Royal Town Planning Institute]]\n*[[Society for the Advancement of Management Studies]]\n*[[Scottish Economic Society]]\n*[[The Society of Legal Scholars|Society of Legal Scholars]]\n*[[Social Policy Association]]\n*[[Social Research Association]]\n*[[Social Services Research Group]]\n*[[Society for Research into Higher Education]]\n*[[Society for Studies in Organizing Healthcare]]\n*[[Socio-Legal Studies Association]]\n*[[The UK Evaluation Society]]\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n[[Campaign for Social Science]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n*{{cite news |first=David |last=Blunkett |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Influence or irrelevance?  |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=150012&sectioncode=26 |work=Times Higher Education  |publisher= |date=4 February 2000 |accessdate=2008-07-10 }}\n*{{cite news |first=Huw |last=Richards |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Beyond the Tweed: where social scientists can raise their voices   |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=149494&sectioncode=26  |work=Times Higher Education |publisher= |date=24 December 1999 |accessdate=2008-07-10 }}\n*{{cite news |first=Donald |last=MacLeod |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Russell group applauds higher white paper |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/specialreports/tuitionfees/story/0,,884690,00.html |work=The Guardian |publisher= |date= January 29, 2003 |accessdate=2008-07-10 }}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.acss.org.uk/ Academy Homepage]\n*[http://www.campaignforsocialscience.org.uk/ Campaign for Social Science Homepage]\n\n[[Category:Fellows of the Academy of Social Sciences|Fellows of the Academy on Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Learned societies of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Social sciences organizations]]\n[[Category:1980s establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in the 1980s]]"}]}}}}
