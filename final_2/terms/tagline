Many [[slogan|tagline slogan]]s are [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|reiterated]] [[phrase]]s [[Association (psychology)|associate]]d with an [[individual]], [[social group]], or [[Product (business)|product]]. As a variant of a [[Advertising slogan|branding slogan]], taglines can be used in [[marketing]] materials and [[advertising]].\n\nThe [[idea]] behind the [[concept]] is to create a memorable [[Dramatic structure|dramatic phrase]] that will sum up the [[Tone (literature)|tone]] and [[premise]] of an [[Multimedia|audio/visual]] product,<ref group=\"note\">Such as a [[movie film]] or a television [[brand]]</ref> or to [[Reinforcement|reinforce and strengthen]] the audience's [[memory]] of a [[Literature|literary product]]. Some taglines are successful enough to warrant inclusion in [[popular culture]]. Consulting companies which specialize in creating taglines may be hired to create a tagline for a brand or product.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n''Tagline'', ''tag line'', and ''tag'' are American terms. In the U.K. they are called ''end lines'', ''endlines'', or ''straplines''. In Belgium they are called ''baselines''. In France they are ''signatures''. In Germany they are ''claims''. In the Netherlands and Italy, they are ''pay offs'' or ''pay-offs''.<ref>[http://www.adslogans.co.uk/ans/nomenclature.html Timothy R. V. Foster, \"The Art and Science of the Advertising Slogan\"], at AdSlogans.com.</ref>\n\n==Organizational usage==\nReferral networking organizations may encourage taglines to be used as the conclusion to an introduction by each attendee. The purpose would be to make the introduction and that speaker more memorable in the minds of the other attendees after the meeting is over. Other terms for taglines are \"memory hooks\" (used by BNI\u00ae) and \"USP\" or \"Unique Selling Proposition\" which is a more commonly known term.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Second-Marketing-Memory-Instantly/ Dr. Ivan Misner \"Seven Second Marketing\"]</ref>\n\n===Headlines versus taglines===\n{{further|Headline}}\nThe tagline is sometimes confused with a headline because information is only presented with the one or the other. Essentially the headline is linked to the information; Once the information changes, the headline is abandoned in favor of a new one. The tagline is related to the entertainment piece and can, therefore, appear on all the information of that product or manufacturer. It is linked to the piece and not to the concept of a specific event. If the sentence is presented next to a logo, as an integral part, it is likely to be a tagline.\n\n==Functional taglines==\nWith a \"tagline\", a supplementary expression is called of a movie film.{{clarify|date=September 2016}}<ref  group=\"note\">Another type of summary of a movie plot is the [[Log line]].</ref> It is an explanatory subtitle, in addition to the actual movie title, on posters or the CD/DVD packaging of videos and music. Taglines can have an enticing effect and are therefore an important aspect in the marketing of films. Increasingly also found in the advertising world, taglines are a form of advertising slogan.<ref group=\"note\">Taglines condense the conceptual message in a memorable sentence.</ref> A tagline for the movie series Star Wars, for example:\n: ''Tagline'': \"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...\" \u2013 ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Taglines for ''Star Wars'' (1977)\n|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/taglines\n|publisher=IMDb\n|accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref>\n: ''Effect'': It was a long time ago in a far, far away galaxy ...\n\n===Film and television===\n\n<!--Don't add a tagline unless the *tagline* is famous, and reference both the tagline and its notability-->\n* \"[[Greta Garbo|Garbo]] talks!\" \u2013 ''[[Anna Christie (1930 film)|Anna Christie]]'', and the follow-up \"Garbo laughs!\"  \u2013 ''[[Ninotchka]]''<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Ninotchka\n|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=29874\n|first=Andrea\n|last=Foshee\n|quote=[']Garbo Laughs!' was the famous catchphrase on which this film was marketed during its release in 1939, recalling the 'Garbo Talks!' campaign for Greta Garbo's initiation into talking pictures with Anna Christie in 1930.\n|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]\n|accessdate=2010-09-27}}</ref>\n* \"Be afraid.

In the late eighties and early nineties, when the amateur computer network [[FidoNet]] began to flourish, the messages that were exchanged between users often had a tag-line, which was no longer than 79 characters, containing a brief phrase (often [[wit|witty]] or [[humor|humorous]]).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Trope (literature)|Trope]]\n* [[Byline]]\n* [[Hook (music)]]\n* [[Jingle]]\n* [[Subliminal stimuli]]\n* [[Subtext]]\n* [[Subtitle (titling)|Subtitle]]\n* [[Catchphrase]]\n\n== References ==\n;Citations\n{{Reflist|2}}\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==External articles==\n* [http://www.taglinedb.com A List of Famous Taglines]. taglinedb.com\n\n[[Category:Film advertising material]]\n[[Category:Advertising slogans]]\n[[Category:Phrases]]\n\n[[nl:Slagzin#Tagline]]\n[[ru:\u0422\u044d\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0439\u043d]]"}]}}}}
