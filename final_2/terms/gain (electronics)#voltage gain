It is usually defined as the mean [[ratio]] of the [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] amplitude or power at the output [[port (circuit theory)|port]] to the amplitude or power at the input port.<ref name=\"Graf\" /> It is often expressed using the [[logarithm]]ic  [[decibel]] (dB) units (\"dB gain\").<ref name=\"White\" />  A gain greater than one (zero dB), that is [[amplifier|amplification]], is the defining property of an [[active component]] or circuit, while a [[passive circuit]] will have a gain of less than one.<ref name=\"White\" />\n\nThe term ''gain'' alone is ambiguous, and can refer to the ratio of output to input  [[voltage]] (''voltage gain''), [[Electric current|current]] (''current gain'') or [[electric power]] (''power gain'').<ref name=\"White\" />  In the field of audio and general purpose [[amplifier]]s, especially [[operational amplifier]]s, the term usually refers to voltage gain,<ref name=\"Basu\" />  but in [[radio frequency]] amplifiers it usually refers to power gain.  Furthermore, the term gain is also applied in systems such as [[sensor]]s where the input and output have different units; in such cases the gain units must be specified, as in \"5 microvolts per photon\" for the [[responsivity]] of a photosensor. The \"gain\" of a [[bipolar transistor]] normally refers to forward current transfer ratio, either ''h''<sub>FE</sub> (\"Beta\", the static ratio of ''I''<sub>''c''</sub> divided by ''I''<sub>b</sub> at some operating point), or sometimes ''h''<sub>fe</sub> (the small-signal current gain, the slope of the graph of ''I''<sub>''c''</sub> against ''I''<sub>''b''</sub> at a point).\n\nThe gain of an electronic device or circuit generally varies with the [[frequency]] of the applied signal.  Unless otherwise stated, the term refers to the gain for frequencies in the [[passband]], the intended operating frequency range, of the equipment. \nThe term ''gain'' has a different meaning in [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] design; [[antenna gain]] is the ratio of [[radiation intensity]] from a directional antenna to <math>P_\\text{in}/4\\pi</math> (mean radiation intensity from a lossless antenna).\n\n==Logarithmic units and decibels==\n\n===Power gain===\n[[Power gain]], in [[decibel]]s (dB), is defined by the 10 log rule as follows:\n\n:<math>\\text{gain}=10 \\log \\left(\\frac{P_\\text{out}}{P_\\text{in}}\\right)~\\text{dB},</math>\n\nwhere <math>P_\\text{in}</math> is the power applied to the input and <math>P_\\text{out}</math> is the power from the output.\n\nA similar calculation can be done using a [[natural logarithm]] instead of a decimal logarithm, resulting in [[neper]]s instead of decibels:\n\n:<math>\\text{gain} = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_\\text{out}}{P_\\text{in}}\\right)~\\text{Np}.</math>\n\nWhen logarithms to the ''decibel base'' <sup><math>db=10^{1/10}=1.258925\\ldots</math></sup> are used in place of the respective bases 10 and ''e'' above, the result is given directly in decibels.  For example, <math>\\log_{db}(1000)=30</math>, in agreement with <math>10\\cdot\\log_{10}(1000)=10\\cdot3=30</math>.\n\n===Voltage gain===\nThe power gain can be calculated using voltage instead of power using [[Joule's first law]] <math>P = V^2/R</math>; the formula is:\n\n:<math>\\text{gain} = 10 \\log{\\frac{\\frac{V_\\text{out}^2}{R_\\text{out}}}{\\frac{V_\\text{in}^2}{R_\\text{in}}}}~\\mathrm{dB}.</math>\n\nIn many cases, the input impedance <math>R_\\text{in}</math> and output impedance <math>R_\\text{out}</math> are equal, so the above equation can be simplified to:\n\n:<math>\\text{gain} = 10 \\log \\left(\\frac{V_\\text{out}}{V_\\text{in}}\\right)^2~\\text{dB},</math>\n\n:<math>\\text{gain} = 20 \\log \\left(\\frac{V_\\text{out}}{V_\\text{in}}\\right)~\\text{dB}.</math>\n\nThis simplified formula, the [[20 log rule]], is used to calculate a '''voltage gain''' in decibels and is equivalent to a power gain only if the [[Electrical impedance|impedances]] at input and output are equal.\n\n===Current gain===\nIn the same way, when power gain is calculated using current instead of power, making the substitution <math>P = I^2 R</math>, the formula is:\n\n:<math>\\text{gain} = 10 \\log{\\left(\\frac{I_\\text{out}^2 R_\\text{out}}{I_\\text{in}^2 R_\\text{in}}\\right)}~\\text{dB}.</math>\n\nIn many cases, the input and output impedances are equal, so the above equation can be simplified to:\n\n:<math>\\text{gain} = 10 \\log \\left(\\frac{I_\\text{out}}{I_\\text{in}}\\right)^2~\\text{dB},</math>\n\n:<math>\\text{gain} = 20 \\log \\left(\\frac{I_\\text{out}}{I_\\text{in}}\\right)~\\text{dB}.</math>\n\nThis simplified formula is used to calculate a '''current gain''' in decibels and is equivalent to the power gain only if the [[Electrical impedance|impedances]] at input and output are equal.\n\nThe \"current gain\" of a [[bipolar transistor]],  <math>h_\\text{FE}</math> or <math>h_\\text{fe}</math>, is normally given as a dimensionless number, the ratio of <math>I_\\text{c}</math> to <math>I_\\text{b}</math> (or slope of the <math>I_\\text{c}</math>-versus-<math>I_\\text{b}</math> graph, for <math>h_\\text{fe}</math>).\n\nIn the cases above, gain will be a dimensionless quantity, as it is the ratio of like units (decibels are not used as units, but rather as a method of indicating a logarithmic relationship).  In the bipolar transistor example, it is the ratio of the output current to the input current, both measured in [[ampere]]s. In the case of other devices, the gain will have a value in [[SI]] units. Such is the case with the [[operational transconductance amplifier]], which has an open-loop gain ([[transconductance]]) in [[siemens]]es ([[mho]]s), because the gain is a ratio of the output current to the input voltage.\n\n===Example===\nQ. An amplifier has an input impedance of 50 ohms and drives a load of 50 ohms. When its input (<math>V_\\text{in}</math>) is 1 volt, its output (<math>V_\\text{out}</math>) is 10 volts. What is its voltage and power gain?\n\nA. Voltage gain is simply:\n\n:<math>\\frac{V_\\text{out}}{V_\\text{in}} = \\frac{10}{1} = 10~\\text{V/V}.</math>\n\nThe units V/V are optional but make it clear that this figure is a voltage gain and not a power gain.\nUsing the expression for power, ''P'' = ''V''<sup>2</sup>/''R'', the power gain is:\n\n:<math>\\frac{V_\\text{out}^2/50}{V_\\text{in}^2/50} = \\frac{V_\\text{out}^2}{V_\\text{in}^2} = \\frac{10^2}{1^2} = 100~\\text{W/W}.</math>\n\nAgain, the units W/W are optional. Power gain is more usually expressed in decibels, thus:\n\n:<math>G_\\text{dB} = 10 \\log G_\\text{W/W} = 10 \\log 100 = 10 \\times 2 = 20~\\text{dB}.</math>\n\nA gain of factor 1 (equivalent to 0&nbsp;dB) where both input and output are at the same voltage level and impedance is also known as ''[[1 (number)|unity]] gain''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Active laser medium]]\n* [[Antenna gain]]\n* [[Aperture-to-medium coupling loss]]\n* [[Automatic gain control]]\n* [[Attenuation]]\n* [[Complex gain]]\n* [[DC offset]]\n* [[Effective radiated power]]\n* [[Gain before feedback]]\n* [[Insertion gain]]\n* [[Loop gain]]\n* [[Open-loop gain]]\n* [[Net gain (telecommunications)|Net gain]]\n* [[Power gain]]\n* [[Process gain]]\n* [[Transmitter power output]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{FS1037C}}\n\n[[Category:Antennas (radio)]]\n[[Category:Electronics terminology]]"}]}}}}
