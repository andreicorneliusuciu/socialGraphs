It switches electric power in many modern appliances: [[variable-frequency drive]]s (VFDs), [[electric car]]s, trains, variable speed refrigerators, lamp ballasts, air-conditioners and even stereo systems with [[switching amplifier]]s. Since it is designed to turn on and off rapidly, [[amplifier]]s that use it often synthesize complex waveforms with [[pulse-width modulation]] and [[low-pass filter]]s. In switching applications modern devices feature [[Pulse repetition frequency|pulse repetition rate]]s well into the ultrasonic range\u2014frequencies which are at least ten times the highest audio frequency handled by the device when used as an analog audio amplifier.\n\nThe IGBT combines the simple gate-drive characteristics of [[Power MOSFET|MOSFET]]s with the high-current and low-saturation-voltage capability of [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar transistor]]s. The IGBT combines an isolated-gate [[field-effect transistor|FET]] for the control input and a bipolar power [[transistor]] as a switch in a single device. The IGBT is used in medium- to high-power applications like [[switched-mode power supplies]], [[traction motor]] control and [[induction heating]]. Large IGBT modules typically consist of many devices in parallel and can have very high current-handling capabilities in the order of hundreds of [[ampere]]s with blocking voltages of {{nowrap|6000 [[volts|V]]}}. These IGBTs can control loads of hundreds of [[kilowatts]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|+\n!colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\"|IGBT Comparison Table <ref>[http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/power/insulated-gate-bipolar-transistor.html Basic Electronics Tutorials.]</ref>\n|+\n|- style=\"font-size:12pt\"  valign=\"bottom\"\n| width=\"155\" height=\"16\" | Device Characteristic\n| width=\"135\" | Power Bipolar\n| width=\"135\" | Power MOSFET\n| width=\"135\" | IGBT\n\n|- style=\"font-size:12pt\"  valign=\"bottom\"\n| height=\"16\" | Voltage Rating\n | High <1kV\n | High <1kV\n | Very High >1kV\n\n|- style=\"font-size:12pt\"  valign=\"bottom\"\n| height=\"16\" | Current Rating\n | High <500A\n | Low <200A\n | High >500A\n\n|- style=\"font-size:12pt\"  valign=\"bottom\"\n| height=\"19\" | Input Drive\n | Current hFE <br />20-200 \n | Voltage VGS <br />3-10V\n | Voltage VGE <br />4-8V\n\n|- style=\"font-size:12pt\"  valign=\"bottom\"\n| height=\"16\" | Input Impedance\n | Low\n | High\n | High\n\n|- style=\"font-size:12pt\"  valign=\"bottom\"\n| height=\"16\" | Output Impedance\n | Low\n | Medium\n | Low\n\n|- style=\"font-size:12pt\"  valign=\"bottom\"\n| height=\"16\" | Switching Speed\n | Slow (\u00b5s)\n | Fast (ns)\n | Medium\n\n|- style=\"font-size:12pt\"  valign=\"bottom\"\n| height=\"16\" | Cost\n | Low\n | Medium\n | High\n\n|}\n\n\nThe first-generation IGBTs of the 1980s and early 1990s were prone to failure through effects such as [[latchup]] (in which the device will not turn off as long as current is flowing) and [[secondary breakdown]] (in which a localized hotspot in the device goes into [[thermal runaway]] and burns the device out at high currents). Second-generation devices were much improved. The current third-generation IGBTs are even better, with speed rivaling MOSFETs, and excellent ruggedness and tolerance of overloads.<ref name=\"A.Nakagawa 1987\">A.Nakagawa et al., \"Safe operating area for 1200-V non-latch-up bipolar-mode MOSFETs\", IEEE Trans. on Electron Devices, ED-34, pp. 351\u2013355(1987)</ref> Extremely high pulse ratings of second- and third-generation devices also make them useful for generating large power pulses in areas including [[particle physics|particle]] and [[plasma physics]], where they are starting to supersede older devices such as  [[thyratron]]s and [[Triggered spark gap|triggered spark gaps]].

There are developments that use an [[ion gel]] to improve manufacturing and reduce the voltage required.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.license.umn.edu/Products/Ion-Gel-as-a-Gate-Insulator-in-Field-Effect-Transistors__Z07062.aspx|title=Ion Gel as a Gate Insulator in Field Effect Transistors}}</ref>\n\n==Device structure==\n\n[[Image:IGBT Cross Section.jpg|right|thumb|Cross section of a typical IGBT showing internal connection of MOSFET and Bipolar Device]]\n\nAn IGBT cell is constructed similarly to a n-channel vertical construction [[power MOSFET]] except the n+ drain is replaced with a p+ collector layer, thus forming a vertical PNP [[bipolar junction transistor]].\n\nThis additional p+ region creates a cascade connection of a PNP bipolar junction transistor with the surface n-channel [[MOSFET]].\n\n==Comparison with power MOSFETs==\n\nAn IGBT features a significantly lower forward voltage drop compared to a conventional MOSFET in higher blocking voltage rated devices. As the blocking voltage rating of both MOSFET and IGBT devices increases, the depth of the n- drift region must increase and the doping must decrease, resulting in roughly square relationship decrease in forward conduction versus blocking voltage capability of the device. By injecting minority carriers (holes) from the collector p+ region into the n- drift region during forward conduction, the resistance of the n- drift region is considerably reduced. However, this resultant reduction in on-state forward voltage comes with several penalties:\n\n* The additional PN junction blocks reverse current flow. This means that unlike a MOSFET, IGBTs cannot conduct in the reverse direction. In bridge circuits, where reverse current flow is needed, an additional diode (called a [[flyback diode|freewheeling diode]]) is placed in parallel with the IGBT to conduct current in the opposite direction. The penalty isn't overly severe because at higher voltages, where IGBT usage dominates, discrete diodes have a significantly higher performance than the body diode of a MOSFET.\n* The reverse bias rating of the N-drift region to collector P+ diode is usually only of tens of volts, so if the circuit application applies a reverse voltage to the IGBT, an additional series diode must be used.\n* The minority carriers injected into the N-drift region take time to enter and exit or recombine at turn-on and turn-off. This results in longer switching times, and hence higher switching loss compared to a power MOSFET.\n* The on-state forward voltage drop in IGBTs behaves very differently from power MOSFETS. The MOSFET voltage drop can be modeled as a resistance, with the voltage drop proportional to current. By contrast, the IGBT has a diode-like voltage drop (typically of the order of 2V) increasing only with the [[natural logarithm|log]] of the current. Additionally, MOSFET resistance is typically lower for smaller blocking voltages, so the choice between IGBTs and power MOSFETS will depend on both the blocking voltage and current involved in a particular application.\n\nIn general, high voltage, high current and low switching frequencies favor the IGBT while low voltage, low current and high switching frequencies are the domain of the MOSFET.\n\n==IGBT models==\nCircuits with IGBTs can be developed and [[computer modeling|modeled]] with various [[electronic circuit simulation|circuit  simulating]] computer programs such as [[SPICE]], [[Saber (software)|Saber]], and other programs. To simulate an IGBT circuit, the device (and other devices in the circuit) must have a model which predicts or simulates the device's response to various voltages and currents on their electrical terminals. For more precise simulations the effect of temperature on various parts of the IGBT may be included with the simulation.\nTwo common methods of modeling are available: [[semiconductor device physics|device physics]]-based model, [[equivalent circuit|equivalent circuits]] or macromodels. [[SPICE]] simulates IGBTs using a macromodel that combines an ensemble of components like [[field-effect transistor|FET]]s and [[bipolar junction transistor|BJT]]s in a [[Darlington transistor|Darlington configuration]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} An alternative physics-based model is the Hefner model, introduced by Allen Hefner of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]. Hefner's model is fairly complex that has shown very good results. Hefner's model is described in a 1988 paper and was later extended to a thermo-electrical model which include the IGBT's response to internal heating. This model has been added to a version of the [[Saber (software)|Saber]] simulation software.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Hefner Jr. |first1 = Allen R Jr |last2= Diebolt |first2= DM |url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=321038 |title= An experimentally verified IGBT model implemented in the Saber circuit simulator |publisher= IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics |volume= 9 |issue= 5 |pages= 532\u2013542 |year= 1994 |accessdate= January 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Usage ==\n\n<center>\n{| border=0\n| valign=top |  [[Image:IGBT 3300V 1200A Mitsubishi.jpg|thumb|IGBT-Module (IGBTs and [[flyback diode|freewheeling diodes]]) with a rated current of {{nowrap|1,200 A}} and a maximum voltage of {{nowrap|3,300 V}}]] || [[Image:IGBT 2441.JPG|thumb|Opened IGBT module with four IGBTs {{nobr|(half of [[H-bridge]])}} rated for {{nowrap|400 A}} {{nowrap|600 V}}]] || [[Image:igbt.jpg|thumb|Small IGBT module, rated up to {{nowrap|30 A}}, up to {{nowrap|900 V}}]] || [[File:CM600DU-24NFH.jpg|thumb|Powerex CM600DU-24NFH IGBT module rated for {{nowrap|600 A}} {{nowrap|1200 V}}, with the cover removed to show the IGBT dies and freewheeling diodes.]]\n|}\n</center>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Bootstrapping (electronics)|Bootstrapping]]\n* [[FGMOS]]\n* [[Solar inverter]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last1=Wintrich |first1= Arendt |last2= Nicolai |first2= Ulrich |last3= Tursky |first3= Werner |last4= Reimann |first4= Tobias |title= Application Manual Power Semiconductors |url= https://www.semikron.com/service-support/application-manual.html |format= PDF-Version |edition= 2nd Revised |year= 2015 |publisher=ISLE Verlag |location=Germany |isbn= 978-3-938843-83-3}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Insulated_gate_bipolar_transistors|IGBT}}\n* [http://www.elec.gla.ac.uk/groups/dev_mod/papers/igbt/igbt.html Device physics information] from the [[University of Glasgow]]\n* [http://www.intusoft.com/articles/Igbt.pdf Spice model for IGBT]\n* [http://www.powerguru.org/igbt-driver-calculation/ IGBT driver calculation]\n\n{{Electronic component}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Transistor types]]\n[[Category:Solid state switches]]\n[[Category:Power electronics]]\n[[Category:Bipolar transistors]]"}]}}}}
