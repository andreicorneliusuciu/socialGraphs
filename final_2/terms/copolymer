If the probability of finding a given type monomer residue at a particular point in the chain is equal to the mole fraction of that monomer residue in the chain, then the polymer may be referred to as a truly '''random copolymer'''<ref name=\"PC14\">Painter P. C. and Coleman M. M., ''Fundamentals of Polymer Science'', CRC Press, 1997, p 14.</ref> (3).\n*'''Block copolymers''' comprise two or more homopolymer subunits linked by covalent bonds (4). The union of the homopolymer subunits may require an intermediate non-repeating subunit, known as a '''junction block'''. Block copolymers with two or three distinct blocks are called '''diblock copolymers''' and '''triblock copolymers''', respectively.\n\nCopolymers may also be described in terms of the existence of or arrangement of '''branches''' in the polymer structure. '''Linear copolymers''' consist of a single main chain whereas '''branched copolymers''' consist of a single main chain with one or more polymeric side chains.\n\nOther special types of branched copolymers include '''star copolymers''', '''brush copolymers''', and '''comb copolymers'''. In [[gradient copolymers]] the monomer composition changes gradually along the chain.\n\n{{anchor|terpolymer}}\nA '''terpolymer''' is a copolymer consisting of three distinct [[monomer]]s. The term is derived from ''ter'' (Latin), meaning thrice, and [[polymer]].\n\n*'''Stereoblock copolymers'''\n[[File:Stereobl.png|thumb|left]]\nA special structure can be formed from one monomer where now the distinguishing feature is the [[tacticity]] of each block.\n\n===Graft copolymers===\n'''Graft copolymers''' are a special type of branched copolymer in which the side chains are structurally distinct from the main chain. The [[:File:Copolymers.svg|illustration]] (5) depicts a special case where the main chain and side chains are composed of distinct homopolymers. However, the individual chains of a graft copolymer may be homopolymers or copolymers.  Note that different copolymer sequencing is sufficient to define a structural difference, thus an A-B diblock copolymer with A-B alternating copolymer side chains is properly called a graft copolymer.\n\nFor example, suppose we perform a [[radical polymerization|free-radical polymerization]] of [[styrene]] in the presence of [[polybutadiene]], a [[synthetic rubber]], which retains one reactive C=C [[covalent bond|double bond]] per [[residue (chemistry)|residue]]. We get [[polystyrene]] chains growing out in either direction from some of the places where there were double bonds, with a one-carbon rearrangement. Or to look at it the other way around, the result is a polystyrene backbone with polybutadiene chains growing out of it in both directions. This is an interesting copolymer variant in that one of the ingredients was a polymer to begin with.\n\nAs with block copolymers, the quasi-[[composite material|composite]] product has properties of both \"components\". In the example cited, the rubbery chains absorb energy when the substance is hit, so it is much less brittle than ordinary polystyrene. The product is called high-impact polystyrene, or HIPS.\n\n===Block copolymers===\nOne kind of copolymer is called a \"block copolymer\". Block copolymers are made up of blocks of different [[polymerized]] [[monomers]] and is usually made by first polymerizing [[styrene]], and then subsequently polymerizing methyl methacrylate (MMA) from the reactive end of the polystyrene chains. This polymer is a \"diblock copolymer\" because it contains two different chemical blocks. Triblocks, tetrablocks, multiblocks, etc. can also be made. Diblock copolymers are made using [[living polymerization]] techniques, such as atom transfer free radical polymerization ([[ATRP (chemistry)|ATRP]]), reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer ([[RAFT (chemistry)|RAFT]]), [[ring-opening metathesis polymerization]] (ROMP), and living cationic or living anionic [[living polymerization|polymerization]]s.<ref>Hadjichristidis N., Pispas S., Floudas G. Block copolymers: synthetic strategies, physical properties, and applications \u2013 Wiley, 2003.</ref> An emerging technique is [[chain shuttling polymerization]].\n\nThe \"'''blockiness'''\" of a copolymer is a measure of the adjacency of comonomers vs their statistical distribution.  Many or even most synthetic polymers are in fact copolymers, containing about 1-20% of a minority monomoner.  In such cases, blockiness is undesirable.<ref name=Chum>Chum, P. S.; Swogger, K. W., \"Olefin Polymer Technologies-History and Recent Progress at the Dow Chemical Company\", Progress in Polymer Science 2008, volume 33, 797-819. {{DOI|10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2008.05.003}}</ref>\n\n====Phase separation====\n[[File:Sbs block copolymer.jpg|thumb|right|SBS block copolymer in [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]]]]\nBlock copolymers are interesting because they can \"microphase separate\" to form periodic [[nanostructures]], as in the styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer shown at right. The polymer is known as [[Kraton (polymer)|Kraton]] and is used for shoe soles and [[adhesive]]s. Owing to the microfine structure, the transmission electron microscope or [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]] was needed to examine the structure. The butadiene matrix was stained with [[osmium tetroxide]] to provide contrast in the image. The material was made by [[living polymerization]] so that the blocks are almost [[monodisperse]], so helping to create a very regular microstructure. The [[molecular weight]] of the polystyrene blocks in the main picture is 102,000; the inset picture has a molecular weight of 91,000, producing slightly smaller domains.\n[[Image:SBSstructure.svg|thumb|right|SBS block copolymer schematic microstructure]]\nMicrophase separation is a situation similar to that of [[oil]] and [[water]]. Oil and water are immiscible - they phase separate. Due to incompatibility between the blocks, block copolymers undergo a similar phase separation. Because the blocks are covalently bonded to each other, they cannot demix macroscopically as water and oil. In \"microphase separation\" the blocks form [[nanometer]]-sized structures. Depending on the relative lengths of each block, several morphologies can be obtained. In diblock copolymers, sufficiently different block lengths lead to nanometer-sized spheres of one block in a matrix of the second (for example [[Polymethyl methacrylate|PMMA]] in polystyrene). Using less different block lengths, a \"hexagonally packed cylinder\" geometry can be obtained. Blocks of similar length form layers (often called [[lamella (materials)|lamellae]] in the technical literature). Between the cylindrical and lamellar phase is the [[gyroid]] phase. The nanoscale structures created from block copolymers could potentially be used for creating devices for use in computer [[memory]], nanoscale-templating and nanoscale separations.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gazit | first1 = Oz | last2 = Khalfin | first2 = Rafail | last3 = Cohen | first3 = Yachin | last4 = Tannenbaum | first4 = Rina | author4-link = Rina Tannenbaum | year = 2009 | title = Self-assembled diblock copolymer \"nanoreactors\" as catalysts for metal nanoparticle synthesis | url = | journal = Journal of Physical Chemistry C | volume = 113 | issue = | pages = 576\u2013583 | doi = 10.1021/jp807668h }}</ref>\n\nPolymer scientists use [[thermodynamics]] to describe how the different blocks interact.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bates | first1 = Frank S.  | last2 = Fredrickson | first2 = Glenn H. | year = 2014 | title = Block Copolymer Thermodynamics: Theory and Experiment | url = | journal = Annual Review of Physical Chemistry | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 525\u2013557 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.pc.41.100190.002521}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chremos | first1 = Alexandros | last2 = Nikoubashman | first2 = Arash | last3 = Panagiotopoulos | first3 = Athanassios | year = 2014 | title = Flory-Huggins parameter \u03c7, from binary mixtures of Lennard-Jones particles to block copolymer melts | url = | journal = J.

It is a way of improving mechanical properties, in a technique known as [[rubber toughening]]. Elastomeric phases within a rigid matrix act as crack arrestors, and so increase the energy absorption when the material is impacted for example. [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] is a common example.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Polymer#Monomer arrangement in copolymers|Copolymers section of Polymer article]]\n* [[Thermoplastic elastomer]]\n* [[Tholin]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Copolymers}}\n* [http://www.chem.rochester.edu/~chem421/copoly.htm  Introduction to Polymer Chemistry]\n\n[[Category:Polymer chemistry]]\n[[Category:Copolymers| ]]\n\n[[pl:Kopolimeryzacja]]"}]}}}}
