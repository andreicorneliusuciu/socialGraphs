In other words, compressive strength resists [[Compression (physics)|compression]] (being pushed together), whereas tensile strength resists [[Tension (physics)|tension]] (being pulled apart). In the study of [[strength of materials]], tensile strength, compressive strength, and [[shear strength]] can be analyzed independently.\n\nSome materials fracture at their compressive strength limit; others deform irreversibly, so a given amount of deformation may be considered as the limit for compressive load. Compressive strength is a key value for design of structures.\n\n[[File:Army.mil-2007-02-07-153623.jpg| thumb|150 px|Measuring the compressive strength of a steel [[Drum (container)|drum]]]]\nCompressive strength is often measured on a [[universal testing machine]]; these range from very small table-top systems to ones with over 53 [[Newton (unit)|MN]] capacity.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = NIST\n  | title = Large Scale Structure Testing Facility\n  | url = http://www.nist.gov/bfrl/facilities_instruments/large_scale_struct_testing_fac.cfm\n  | accessdate = 04-05-2010 | postscript =.}}</ref> Measurements of compressive strength are affected by the specific [[test method]] and conditions of measurement. Compressive strengths are usually reported in relationship to a specific [[technical standard]].\n\n== Introduction ==\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction= horizontal<!-- horizontal (default), vertical -->\n|image1=Tension applied.svg\n|width1=75\n|caption1=[[Tension (physics)|Tension]]\n|alt1=\n|image2=Compression applied.svg\n|width2=75\n|caption2=[[Compression (physics)|Compression]]\n|alt2=\n}}\n\nWhen a specimen of material is loaded in such a way that it extends it is said to be in ''tension''. On the other hand, if the material [[compression (physical)|compresses]] and shortens it is said to be in ''compression''.\n\nOn an atomic level, the molecules or [[atoms]] are forced apart when in tension whereas in compression they are forced together. Since atoms in solids always try to find an equilibrium position, and distance between other atoms, forces arise throughout the entire material which oppose both tension or compression. The phenomena prevailing on an atomic level are therefore similar.\n\nThe \"strain\" is the relative change in length under applied stress; positive strain characterises an object under tension load which tends to lengthen it, and a compressive stress that shortens an object gives negative strain. Tension tends to pull small sideways deflections back into alignment, while compression tends to amplify such deflection into [[buckling]].\n\nCompressive strength is measured on materials, components,<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Urbanek\n  | first = T\n  | author-link =\n  | last2 =Lee, Johnson\n  | first2 =\n  | title = Column Compression Strength of Tubular Packaging Forms Made of Paper\n  | place =\n  | publisher = Journal of Testing and Evaluation\n  | volume = 34,6\n  | pages =31\u201340\n  | language =\n  | url = http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/pdf2006/fpl_2006_urbanik001.pdf\n  | archiveurl =\n  | accessdate =13 May 2014}}</ref> and structures.<ref>{{Citation\n| last = Ritter\n| first = m A\n| last2= Oliva\n| chapter = 9, Design of Longitudinal Stress-Laminated Deck Superstructures\n| year =1990 \n| title = Timber Bridges: Design, Construction, Inspection, and Maintenance\n| publisher = US Dept of Agriculture, Forest Products Laboratory\n| publication-date = 2010\n| url = http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/misc/em7700_8_chapter09.pdf\n|accessdate=13 May 2014\n}}</ref>\n\nBy definition, the ultimate compressive strength of a material is that value of uniaxial [[compressive stress]] reached when the material fails completely. The compressive strength is usually obtained experimentally by means of a ''compressive test''. The apparatus used for this experiment is the same as that used in a tensile test. However, rather than applying a uniaxial tensile load, a uniaxial compressive load is applied. As can be imagined, the specimen (usually cylindrical) is shortened as well as spread [[wiktionary:lateral|laterally]]. A [[stress\u2013strain curve]] is plotted by the instrument and would look similar to the following:\n[[File:engineering stress strain.svg|thumb|left|True Stress-Strain curve for a typical specimen]]\n\nThe compressive strength of the material would correspond to the stress at the red point shown on the curve. In a compression test, there is a linear region where the material follows [[Hooke's Law]]. Hence for this region ''<math>\\sigma=E\\epsilon</math>'' where this time E refers to the Young's Modulus for compression. In this region, the material deforms elastically and returns to its original length when the stress is removed.\n\nThis linear region terminates at what is known as the [[yield point]]. Above this point the material behaves [[Plasticity (physics)|plastically]] and will not return to its original length once the load is removed.\n\nThere is a difference between the engineering stress and the true stress. By its basic definition the uniaxial stress is given by:\n\n<math>\\sigma = \\frac{F}{A}</math>\n\nwhere,\nF = Load applied [N],\nA = Area [m<sup>2</sup>]\n\nAs stated, the area of the specimen varies on compression. In reality therefore the area is some function of the applied load i.e. A = f(F). Indeed, stress is defined as the force divided by the area at the start of the experiment. This is known as the engineering stress and is defined by,\n\n<math>\\sigma_e = \\frac{F}{A_0}</math>\n\nA<sub>0</sub>=Original specimen area [m<sup>2</sup>]\n\nCorrespondingly, the engineering [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] would be defined by:\n\n<math>\\epsilon_e = \\frac{l-l_0}{l_0}</math>\n\nwhere\nl = current specimen length [m] and l<sub>0</sub> = original specimen length [m]\n\nThe compressive strength would therefore correspond to the point on the engineering stress strain curve <math>(\\epsilon_e^*,\\sigma_e^*)</math> defined by\n\n<math>\\sigma_e^* = \\frac{F^*}{A_0}</math>\n\n<math>\\epsilon_e^* = \\frac{l^*-l_0}{l_0}</math>\n\nwhere\nF<sup>*</sup> = load applied just before crushing and l<sup>*</sup> = specimen length just before crushing.\n\n== Deviation of engineering stress from true stress ==\n[[File:Barelling.svg|75px|thumb|Barrelling]]\n\nIn engineering design practice, professionals mostly rely on the engineering stress. In reality, the ''true stress'' is different from the engineering stress. Hence calculating the compressive strength of a material from the given equations will not yield an accurate result.{{clarify|date=January 2016}} This is because the cross sectional area A<sub>0</sub> changes and is some function of load A = \u03c6(F).\n\nThe difference in values may therefore be summarized as follows:\n* On compression, the specimen will shorten. The material will tend to spread in the lateral direction and hence increase the [[Cross section (geometry)|cross sectional]] area.\n* In a compression test the specimen is clamped at the edges.{{dubious|date=January 2016}} For this reason, a frictional force arises which will oppose the lateral spread. This means that work has to be done to oppose this frictional force hence increasing the energy consumed during the process. This results in a slightly inaccurate value of stress obtained from the experiment.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nAs a final note, it should be mentioned that the frictional force mentioned in the second point is not constant for the entire cross section of the specimen. It varies from a minimum at the centre, away from the clamps, to a maximum at the edges where it is clamped. Due to this, a phenomenon known as ''barrelling'' occurs where the specimen attains a barrel shape.\n\n== Comparison of compressive and tensile strengths ==\nConcrete and ceramics typically have much higher compressive strengths than tensile strengths. Composite materials, such as glass fiber epoxy matrix composite, tend to have higher tensile strengths than compressive strengths. Metals tend to have tensile and compressive strengths that are very similar.\n\n== Typical values ==\n{|width=264 border=1 bordercolor=\"#000000\" cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 align=center\n|Material || R<sub>s</sub> [MPa]\n|-]\n|-\n|[[Porcelain]] || 500\n|-\n|[[Bone]] || 150\n|-\n|[[Ice]] (0&nbsp;\u00b0C) || 3\n|-\n|[[Styrofoam]] || ~1\n|}\n\n== Compressive Strength of Concrete ==\nCompressive strength is one of the most important engineering property of Concrete which designers are concerned of. It is a standard industrial practice that the concrete is classified based on grades. This grade is nothing but the Compressive Strength of the concrete cube or cylinder. Cube or Cylinder samples are usually tested under a compression testing machine to obtain the compressive strength of concrete. The test requisites differ country to country based on the design code. As per Indian codes, compressive strength of concrete is defined as \n\n''The '''compressive strength of concrete''' is given in terms of the '''characteristic compressive strength''' of 150 mm size cubes tested at 28 days (fck). The '''characteristic strength''' is defined as the '''strength''' of the '''concrete''' below which not more than 5% of the test results are expected to fall.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://civildigital.com/compressive-strength-concrete-concrete-cubes/|title=Compressive Strength of Concrete & Concrete Cubes {{!}} What {{!}} How {{!}} CivilDigital {{!}}|date=2016-07-07|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-20}}</ref>\n\nFor design purposes, this compressive strength value is restricted by dividing with a factor of safety, whose value depends on the design philosophy used.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Container compression test]]\n* [[Deformation (engineering)]]\n* [[Schmidt hammer]], for measuring compressive strength of materials\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* Mikell P.Groover, Fundamentals of Modern Manufacturing, John Wiley & Sons, 2002 U.S.A, ISBN 0-471-40051-3\n* Callister W.D.
