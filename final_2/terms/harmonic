First as sounded (more common), then as fingered (easier to sightread).]]\n\nThe term '''harmonic''' in its strictest sense describes any member of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]]. The term is employed in various disciplines, including music and acoustics, electronic power transmission, radio technology, etc. It is typically applied to repeating signals, such as [[Sine|sinusoidal]] waves. A harmonic of such a [[wave]] is a wave with a [[frequency]] that is a positive [[integer]] multiple of the frequency of the original wave, known as the [[fundamental frequency]]. The original [[wave]] is also called 1st harmonic, the following harmonics are known as higher harmonics. As all harmonics are periodic at the fundamental frequency, the sum of harmonics is also periodic at that frequency. For example, if the fundamental frequency is 50&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]], a common [[alternating current|AC]] power supply frequency, the frequencies of the first three higher harmonics are 100&nbsp;Hz (2nd harmonic), 150&nbsp;Hz (3rd harmonic), 200&nbsp;Hz (4th harmonic) and any addition of waves with these frequencies is periodic at 50&nbsp;Hz.\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nMost acoustic instruments emit complex tones containing many individual partials (component simple tones or sinusoidal waves), but the untrained human ear typically does not perceive those partials as separate phenomena. Rather, a musical note is perceived as one sound, the quality or [[timbre]] of that sound being a result of the relative strengths of the individual partials.\n\nMany acoustic [[oscillator]]s, such as the [[human voice]] or a [[Bow (music)|bowed]] [[violin]] string, produce complex tones that are more or less [[Periodic function|periodic]], and thus are composed of partials that are near matches to integer multiples of the fundamental frequency and therefore resemble the ideal harmonics and are called \"harmonic partials\" or simply \"harmonics\" for convenience (although it's not strictly accurate to call a partial a harmonic, the first being real and the second being ideal). Oscillators that produce harmonic partials behave somewhat like 1-dimensional resonators, and are often long and thin, such as a guitar string or a column of air open at both ends (as with the modern orchestral [[transverse flute]]). Wind instruments whose air column is open at only one end, such as trumpets and clarinets, also produce partials resembling harmonics. However they only produce partials matching the odd harmonics, at least in theory. The reality of acoustic instruments is such that none of them behaves as perfectly as the somewhat simplified theoretical models would predict.\n\nPartials whose frequencies are not integer multiples of the fundamental are referred to as [[Inharmonicity|''inharmonic partials'']].\n\nSome acoustic instruments emit a mix of harmonic and inharmonic partials but still produce an effect on the ear of having a definite fundamental pitch, such as [[piano]]s, strings plucked [[pizzicato]], vibraphones, marimbas, and certain pure-sounding bells or chimes. Antique [[singing bowl]]s are known for producing multiple harmonic partials or [[multiphonics]].\n<ref>[http://www.acoustics.org/press/134th/galembo.htm Acoustical Society of America - Large grand and small upright pianos] by Alexander Galembo and Lola L. Cuddly</ref>\n<ref>Hanna J\u00e4rvel\u00e4inen et al. 1999. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228587669_Audibility_of_Inharmonicity_in_String_Instrument_Sounds_and_Implications_to_Digital_Sound_Synthesis \"Audibility of Inharmonicity in String Instrument Sounds, and Implications to Digital Sound Systems\"]</ref>\n\nOther oscillators, such as [[cymbals]], drum heads, and other percussion instruments, naturally produce an abundance of inharmonic partials and do not imply any particular pitch, and therefore cannot be used melodically or harmonically in the same way other instruments can.\n\n==Partials, overtones, and harmonics==\n<!-- [[Flageolet (disambiguation)]] links to this section -->\n\nAn [[overtone]] is any partial higher than the lowest partial in a compound tone. The relative strengths and frequency relationships of the component partials determine the timbre of an instrument. The similarity between the terms overtone and partial sometimes leads to their being loosely used interchangeably in a [[music]]al context, but they are counted differently, leading to some possible confusion. In the special case of instrumental timbres whose component partials closely match a harmonic series (such as with most strings and winds) rather than being inharmonic partials (such as with most pitched percussion instruments), it is also convenient to call the component partials \"harmonics\" but not strictly correct (because harmonics are numbered the same even when missing, while partials and overtones are only counted when present). This chart demonstrates how the three types of names (partial, overtone, and harmonic) are counted (assuming that the harmonics are present):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n!Frequency\n!Order\n!Name 1\n!Name 2\n!Name 3\n!Wave Representation\n!Molecular Representation\n|-\n| ''1 \u00b7 f '' = &nbsp;&nbsp;440&nbsp;Hz\n| ''n = 1''\n| 1st partial\n| [[fundamental tone]]\n| 1st harmonic\n|[[File:Pipe001.gif|220px]]\n|[[File:Molecule1.gif|220px]]\n|-\n| ''2 \u00b7 f '' = &nbsp;&nbsp;880&nbsp;Hz\n| ''n = 2''\n| 2nd partial\n| 1st overtone\n| 2nd harmonic\n|[[File:Pipe002.gif|220px]]\n|[[File:Molecule2.gif|220px]]\n|-\n| ''3 \u00b7 f ''= 1320&nbsp;Hz\n| ''n = 3''\n| 3rd partial\n| 2nd overtone\n| 3rd harmonic\n|[[File:Pipe003.gif|220px]]\n|[[File:Molecule3.gif|220px]]\n|-\n| ''4 \u00b7 f ''= 1760&nbsp;Hz\n| ''n = 4''\n| 4th partial\n| 3rd overtone\n| 4th harmonic\n|[[File:Pipe004.gif|220px]]\n|[[File:Molecule4.gif|220px]]\n|}\n\nIn many [[musical instruments]], it is possible to play the upper harmonics without the fundamental note being present. In a simple case (e.g., [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]) this has the effect of making the note go up in pitch by an [[octave]], but in more complex cases many other pitch variations are obtained. In some cases it also changes the [[timbre]] of the note. This is part of the normal method of obtaining higher notes in [[wind instruments]], where it is called ''[[overblowing]]''. The [[extended technique]] of playing [[multiphonic]]s also produces harmonics. On [[string instruments]] it is possible to produce very pure sounding notes, called harmonics or ''flageolets'' by string players, which have an eerie quality, as well as being high in pitch. Harmonics may be used to check at a [[unison]] the tuning of strings that are not tuned to the unison. For example, lightly fingering the node found halfway down the highest string of a [[cello]] produces the same pitch as lightly fingering the node 1/3 of the way down the second highest string. For the human voice see [[Overtone singing]], which uses harmonics.\n\nWhile it is true that electronically produced periodic tones (e.g. square waves or other non-sinusoidal waves) have \"harmonics\" that are whole number multiples of the fundamental frequency, practical instruments do not all have this characteristic. For example, higher \"harmonics\"' of piano notes are not true harmonics but are \"overtones\" and can be very sharp, i.e. a higher frequency than given by a pure [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. This is especially true of instruments other than stringed or brass/woodwind ones, e.g., xylophone, drums, bells etc., where not all the overtones have a simple whole number ratio with the fundamental frequency.\n\nThe [[fundamental frequency]] is the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of the [[period (physics)|period]] of the periodic phenomenon.\n\n{{FS1037C}}\n\n==Harmonics on stringed instruments==\n\n[[Image:Flageolette.svg|thumb|200px|Playing a harmonic on a string]]\nThe following table displays the stop points on a stringed instrument, such as the [[guitar]] ([[guitar harmonics]]), at which gentle touching of a string will force it into a harmonic mode when vibrated.

As a performance technique, it is accomplished by using two fingers on the fingerboard, the first to shorten the string to the desired fundamental, with the second touching the node corresponding to the appropriate harmonic.\n\n==Other information==\n\nHarmonics may be either used or considered as the basis of [[just intonation]] systems.\n\nComposer [[Arnold Dreyblatt]] is able to bring out different harmonics on the single string of his modified [[double bass]] by slightly altering his unique [[bow (music)|bow]]ing technique halfway between hitting and bowing the strings.\n\nComposer [[Lawrence Ball]] uses harmonics to generate music electronically.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{listen\n | filename     = Violin harmonics.ogg\n | title        = Violin harmonics\n | description  = Violin natural harmonic stop points on the A string\n | format       = [[Ogg]]\n | filename2    = Harmonics 110x16.ogg \n | title2       = Harmonics 110x16\n | description2 = Demonstration of 16 harmonics using electronic sine tones, starting with 110 Hz fundamental, 0.5s each.
