Trucks vary greatly in size, power, and configuration, with the smallest being mechanically similar to and larger than an [[automobile]]. Commercial trucks can be very large and powerful, and may be configured to mount specialized equipment, such as in the case of [[fire truck]]s and [[concrete mixer]]s and [[suction excavator]]s.\n\nModern trucks are largely powered by [[diesel engine]]s, although small to medium size trucks with [[gasoline engine]]s exist in the US. In the European Union, vehicles with a [[gross combination mass]] of up to {{convert|3.5|t|lbs|-2|order=flip|abbr=on}} are known as [[light commercial vehicle]]s, and those over as [[large goods vehicle]]s.\n[[File:NW 1st lorry2.jpg|thumb|1898 \"''[[NW First Truck]]''\"]]\n[[File:Alex Pickering van.jpg|thumb|Early flatbed]]\n[[File:Flickr - jimduell - 6-18-11 MACUNGIE ATCA SHOW (1).jpg|thumb|Moving van]]\n[[File:MackTruckAcosta.JPG|thumb|right|Mack AC dump truck]]\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Steam wagons ===\n[[Image:Sentinel DG4 registration KF 6482.jpg|thumb|A British, 1931-built [[Sentinel Waggon Works|Sentinel]] steam waggon]]\n[[File:Sentinel DG8 at Beamish Steam Fair.jpg|thumb|left|Sentinel DG8, Beamish Steam Fair]]\n\n{{Main article|Steam wagon}}\nTrucks and cars have a common ancestor: the steam-powered ''fardier'' [[Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot]] built in 1769.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} However, [[steam wagon]]s were not common until the mid-1800s. The roads of the time, built for horse and carriages, limited these vehicles to very short hauls, usually from a factory to the nearest railway station. The first [[semi-trailer]] appeared in 1881,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} towed by a [[steam tractor]] manufactured by [[De Dion-Bouton]]. Steam-powered wagons were sold in France and the United States until the eve of World War I, and 1935 in the United Kingdom, when a change in road tax rules made them uneconomic against the new diesel lorries.\n\n===Internal combustion===\n[[Image:zzz-1stBus.jpg|thumb|left|A Benz truck modified by Netphener company (1895)]][[File:DMG-lastwagen-cannstatt-1896.jpg|thumb|DMG Lastkraftwagen, 1896]]\nIn 1895 [[Karl Benz]] designed and built the first truck in history using the [[internal combustion]] engine. Later that year some of Benz's trucks were modified to become the first bus by the ''Netphener'', the first motorbus company in history. A year later, in 1896, another internal combustion engine truck was built by [[Gottlieb Daimler]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Truck History|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/bltruck.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=6 September 2008}}</ref> Other companies, such as [[Peugeot]], [[Renault]] and [[B\u00fcssing]], also built their own versions.

In 1904, 700 heavy trucks were built in the United States, 1000 in 1907, 6000 in 1910, and 25000 in 1914.\n\nAfter World War I, several advances were made: pneumatic [[tire]]s replaced the previously common full rubber versions. [[starter motor|Electric starters]], power [[brake]]s, 4, 6, and 8 cylinder engines, closed [[cabin (truck)|cabs]], and electric lighting followed. The first modern [[semi-trailer truck]]s also appeared.

In turn, both sources emanate from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''trokhos'' (\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c7\u03cc\u03c2), meaning \"wheel\", from ''trekhein'' (\u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, \"to run\").\n\nThe first known usage of \"truck\" was in 1611, when it referred to the small strong wheels on ships' cannon carriages. In its extended usage it came to refer to carts for carrying heavy loads, a meaning known since 1771. Its expanded application to \"motor-powered load carrier\" has been in usage since 1930, shortened from \"motor truck\", which dates back to 1901.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/truck?show=2&t=1284721768 \"Truck\"] Merriam-Webster Dictionary</ref><ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=truck&searchmode=none \"Truck\"] ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' 16 September 2010</ref>\n\n\"Lorry\" has a more uncertain origin, but probably has its roots in the [[rail transport]] industry, where the word is known to have been used in 1838 to refer to a type of truck (a [[Railroad car|goods wagon]] as in British usage, not a [[bogie]] as in the American), specifically a large flat wagon. It probably derives from the verb ''lurry'' (to pull, tug) of uncertain origin. Its expanded meaning, \"self-propelled vehicle for carrying goods\", has been in usage since 1911.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=lorry&searchmode=none \"Lorry\"] ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' 16 September 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lorry \"Lorry\"] Merriam-Webster Dictionary</ref> Before that,{{when|date=March 2016}} the word \"lorry\" was used for a sort of big horse-drawn goods wagon.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===International variance===\n{{Details|List of truck types}}\nIn the United States, Canada, and the Philippines \"truck\" is usually reserved for commercial vehicles larger than normal cars, and includes pickups and other vehicles having an open load bed. In Australia, [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]] and [[South African English|South Africa]], the word \"truck\" is mostly reserved for larger vehicles; in Australia and New Zealand, a pickup truck is usually called a [[ute (vehicle)|''ute'']] (short for \"utility\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/onairhighlights/the-first-ute|title=The First Ute|publisher=ABC \u2013 Radio Australia|accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref> while in South Africa it is called a ''bakkie'' ([[Afrikaans]]: \"small open container\"). In the United Kingdom, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Ireland and [[Hong Kong]] ''lorry'' is used instead of ''truck'', but only for the medium and heavy types.\n\n==Types of trucks by size==\n{{see also|Truck classification|List of truck types}}\n\n===Ultra light trucks===\n[[File:Might-E Truck.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Might-E Truck]] from [[Canadian Electric Vehicles]]]]\nOften produced as variations of [[golf car]]s, with internal combustion or [[battery electric vehicle|battery electric drive]], these are used typically for off-highway use on estates, golf courses, and parks. While not suitable for highway use some variations may be licensed as slow speed vehicles for operation on streets, generally as a body variation of a [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]. A few manufactures produce specialized chassis for this type of vehicle, while [[Zap Motors]] markets a version of their xebra electric tricycle (licensable in the U.S. as a motorcycle).\n\n===Very light trucks===\n[[Image:PiaggioTruckMikinos06473.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Piaggio Porter]]]]\n[[Image:Ashok Leyland Dost (1).JPG|thumb|[[Ashok Leyland|Ashok Dost]] Stand in [[Faizabad]] in India]]\nPopular in Europe and Asia, many mini trucks are factory redesigns of light automobiles, usually with [[monocoque]] bodies. Specialized designs with substantial frames such as the Italian Piaggio shown here are based upon Japanese designs (in this case by [[Daihatsu]]) and are popular for use in \"old town\" sections of European cities that often have very narrow alleyways.\n\nRegardless of name, these small trucks serve a wide range of uses. In Japan, they are regulated under the [[Kei car]] laws, which allow vehicle owners a break in taxes for buying a smaller and less-powerful vehicle (currently, the engine is limited to 660 cc displacement). These vehicles are used as on-road utility vehicles in Japan. These Japanese-made mini trucks that were manufactured for on-road use are competing with off-road ATVs in the United States, and import regulations require that these mini trucks have a {{convert|25|mph|abbr=on}} speed governor as they are classified as low speed vehicles.<ref>[http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?rule_toc=777&section=571.3&section_toc=2060 49CFR571]</ref> These vehicles have found uses in construction, large campuses (government, university, and industrial), agriculture, cattle ranches, amusement parks, and replacements for golf carts.<ref>http://www.best-used-tractors.com/mini_truck.html</ref>\n\n'''Major mini truck manufacturers and their brands:'''\n* [[Daihatsu Hijet]]\n* [[Honda Acty]]\n* [[Tata Motors|Tata Havry]]\n* [[Mazda Scrum]]\n* [[Mitsubishi Minicab]]\n* [[Subaru Sambar]]\n* [[Suzuki Carry]]\n{{clear}}\n\n===Light trucks===\n[[File:London Streets van.JPG|thumb|left|London van]]\n[[File:Dongfeng Rich II China 2016-04-07.jpg|thumb|Dongfeng pickup]]\nLight trucks are car-sized (in the US, no more than {{convert|6.3|t|lbs|-2|order=flip|abbr=on}} and are used by individuals and businesses alike.

[[Pneumatic]], [[hydraulic]], [[Engine cooling|water]], and [[electrical]] systems may also be present. Many also tow one or more [[trailer (vehicle)|trailers]] or [[semi-trailer]]s.\n\n===Cab===\n[[File:Scania R470 topline.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Scania R-series|Scania R&nbsp;470]]|Flat nose truck]][[File:Kenworth_T2000,_Kenworth_Dealer_Hall_of_Fame,_2015.JPG|thumb|Streamlined conventional cab]]\nThe [[cabin (truck)|cab]] is an enclosed space where the driver is seated. A \"sleeper\" is a compartment attached to or integral with the cab where the driver can rest while not driving, sometimes seen in [[semi-trailer truck]]s.\n\nThere are several possible cab configurations:\n* \"[[Cab over]] engine\" (COE) or \"flat nose\"; where the driver is seated above the front axle and the [[internal combustion engine|engine]]. This design is almost ubiquitous in Europe, where overall truck lengths are strictly regulated, but also widely used in the rest of the world as well. They were common in North American heavy duty trucks, but lost prominence when permitted length was extended in the early 1980s. Nevertheless, this design is still popular in North America among medium and light duty trucks. To reach the engine, the whole cab tilts forward, earning this design the name of \"tilt-cab\". This type of cab is especially suited to the delivery conditions in Europe where many roads follow the layout of much more ancient paths and trackways which require the additional turning capability given by the short wheelbase of the cab over engine type.{{sfnp|Davies|2000|pp=58\u201361}} The COE design was invented by [[Viktor Schreckengost]].<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/28/AR2008012802613.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Viktor Schreckengost; Designed Bicycles, Dinnerware and More | first=Adam | last=Bernstein | date=29 January 2008 | accessdate=26 May 2010}}</ref>\n* '''[[Conventional truck|Conventional]]''' cabs are the most common in North America and Australia, and are known in the UK as \"American cabs\" and in the Netherlands as \"torpedo cabs\". The driver is seated behind the engine, as in most passenger cars or pickup trucks. Many new cabs are very [[m:wikt:streamline|streamlined]], with a sloped hood and other features to lower drag.\n* '''Cab beside engine''' designs also exist, but are rather rare and are mainly used inside [[shipyard|shipping yard]]s, or other specialist uses that require the vehicle to carry long loads such as pipes, metal rods, flat iron and other construction materials. This type is often custom made from a regular cabover truck that gets the upper half of its cab removed on the passenger side and replaced by an extended section of the bed. \nA further step from this is the side loading [[forklift]] that can be described as a specially fabricated vehicle with the same properties as a truck of this type, in addition to the ability to pick up its own load.\n\n===Engine===\n[[File:Cummins Engine (LKW).jpg|thumb|[[Cummins B Series engine#B6.7|Cummins ISB]] 6.7L medium duty truck diesel engine]]\nMost small trucks such as [[sport utility vehicle]]s (SUVs) or [[pickup truck|pickups]], and even light medium-duty trucks in North America, China, and Russia use [[gasoline engine]]s (petrol engines), but many [[diesel engine]]d models are now being produced. Most of the heavier trucks use [[four stroke cycle|four-stroke]] diesel engines with a [[turbocharger]] and [[intercooler]]. Huge off-highway trucks use locomotive-type engines such as a [[V12 engine|V12]] [[Detroit Diesel]] [[two stroke cycle|two stroke]] engine. Diesel engines are becoming the engine of choice for trucks ranging from class&nbsp;3 to 8 GVWs. A large proportion of refuse trucks in the United States employ [[CNG]] (compressed natural gas) engines for their low fuel cost and reduced carbon emissions.\n\nNorth American manufactured highway trucks often use an engine built by a third party, such as [[Caterpillar Inc.|CAT]], [[Cummins]], or [[Detroit Diesel]], but both [[Mack Truck|Mack]] and [[Navistar]] offer their own engines.<ref>{{cite book|title=Operators Handbook-DM, DMM, U Series|year=1988|publisher=[[Mack Trucks]]|pages=62\u201364}}</ref>\n\nIn the European Union, all new truck engines must comply with [[European emission standards|Euro&nbsp;5]] emission regulations.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===Drivetrain===\n[[File:Rear axles tandem.jpg|thumb|left|A truck rear suspension and drive axles overview]]\n[[File:Eaton Autoshift.jpg|thumb|left|Eaton Roadranger 18 speed \"crash box\" with automated gearshift]]\nSmall trucks use the same type of [[transmission (mechanics)|transmissions]] as almost all [[automobile|cars]], having either an automatic transmission or a manual transmission with [[synchromesh]] (synchronizers). Bigger trucks often use manual transmissions without synchronizers, saving bulk and weight, although synchromesh transmissions are used in larger trucks as well. Transmissions without synchronizers, known as \"crash boxes\", require [[double-clutching]] for each shift, (which can lead to repetitive motion injuries), or a technique known colloquially as \"floating\", a method of changing gears which doesn't use the clutch, except for starts and stops, due to the physical effort of double clutching, especially with non-power-assisted clutches, faster shifts, and less clutch wear.\n\nDouble-clutching allows the driver to control the engine and transmission revolutions to synchronize, so that a smooth shift can be made; for example, when upshifting, the accelerator pedal is released and the clutch pedal is depressed while the gear lever is moved into neutral, the clutch pedal is then released and quickly pushed down again while the gear lever is moved to the next higher gear. Finally, the clutch pedal is released and the accelerator pedal pushed down to obtain required engine speed. Although this is a relatively fast movement, perhaps a second or so while transmission is in neutral, it allows the engine speed to drop and synchronize engine and transmission revolutions relative to the road speed. Downshifting is performed in a similar fashion, except the engine speed is now required to increase (while transmission is in neutral) just the right amount in order to achieve the synchronization for a smooth, non-collision gear change. \"Skip changing\" is also widely used; in principle operation is the same as double-clutching, but it requires neutral be held slightly longer than a single-gear change.\n\nCommon North American setups include 9, 10, 13, 15, and 18&nbsp;speeds. [[automatic transmission|Automatic]] and [[semi-automatic transmission]]s for heavy trucks are becoming more and more common, due to advances both in transmission and engine power. In Europe, 8, 10, 12 and 16&nbsp;gears are common on larger trucks with manual transmission, while automatic or semi-automatic transmissions would have anything from 5 to 12 gears. Almost all heavy truck transmissions are of the \"range and split\" (double H shift pattern) type, where range change and so\u2011called half gears or splits are air operated and always preselected before the main gear selection.\n\n===Frame===\n[[File:A truck chassis section.jpg|thumb|A truck rear frame (chassis) section view]]\n[[File:ToyotaTundraChassis.jpg|thumb|left|Pickup truck frame (right rear view)]]\nA truck [[frame (vehicle)|frame]] consists of two parallel boxed (tubular) or C\u2011shaped rails, or beams, held together by [[crossmember]]s. These frames are referred to as [[ladder frame]]s due to their resemblance to a ladder if tipped on end. The rails consist of a tall vertical section (two if boxed) and two shorter horizontal flanges. The height of the vertical section provides opposition to vertical flex when weight is applied to the top of the frame (beam resistance). Though typically flat the whole length on heavy duty trucks, the rails may sometimes be tapered or arched for clearance around the engine or over the axles. The holes in rails are used either for mounting vehicle components and running wires and hoses, or measuring and adjusting the orientation of the rails at the factory or repair shop.\n\nThe frame is usually made of [[steel]], but can be made (whole or in part) of [[aluminum]] for a lighter weight. A [[drawbar (haulage)|tow bar]] may be found attached at one or both ends, but heavy trucks almost always make use of a [[fifth wheel]] hitch.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}<!-- One out of five heavy trucks (16 tonnes and above) in Sweden are tractors. http://www.vbg.se/sv/support/lfg_statistik/30.-Lastbilar_over_16_ton_1988-.pdf Virtually all other heavy trucks, the majority of the heavy trucks, have a bolt couplings (such as a [[Ringfeder]]). -->\n\n=== Body types ===\n'''[[Box truck]]s''' (\"tilts\" in the UK) have walls and a roof, making an enclosed load space.

The requirements and limitations vary with each different jurisdiction.\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:Inside Mack Granite.JPG|thumb|Inside a Mack truck]]\nIn Australia, a [[truck driver]]'s license is required for any motor vehicle with a [[Gross Vehicle Mass]] (GVM) exceeding {{convert|4.5|t|lbs|-2|order=flip|abbr=on}}. The motor vehicles classes are further expanded as:\n;Combination\n* '''HC''': Heavy Combination, a typical prime mover plus semi-trailer combination.\n* '''MC''': Multi Combination, e.g.,&nbsp;B&nbsp;Doubles/road trains\n\n; Rigid\n* '''LR''': Light rigid: a rigid vehicle with a GVM of more than {{convert|4.5|t|lbs|-2|order=flip|abbr=on}} but not more than {{convert|8|t|lbs|-2|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Any towed trailer must not weigh more than {{convert|9|t|lbs|-2|order=flip|abbr=on}} GVM.\n* '''MR''': Medium rigid: a rigid vehicle with 2&nbsp;axles and a GVM of more than {{convert|8|t|lbs|-2|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Any towed trailer must not weigh more than {{convert|9|t|lbs|-2|order=flip|abbr=on}} GVM. Also includes vehicles in class ''LR''.\n* '''HR''': Heavy Rigid: a rigid vehicle with three or more axles and a GVM of more than {{convert|8|t|lbs|-2|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Any towed trailer must not weigh more than {{convert|9|t|lbs|-2|order=flip|abbr=on}} GVM. Also includes articulated buses and vehicles in class&nbsp;''MR''.\n\n;Heavy vehicle transmission\nThere is also a heavy vehicle transmission condition for a license class ''HC'', ''HR'', or ''MC'' test passed in a vehicle fitted with an automatic or synchromesh transmission; a driver's license will be restricted to vehicles of that class fitted with a synchromesh or automatic transmission. To have the condition removed, a person needs to pass a practical driving test in a vehicle with non-synchromesh transmission (constant mesh or crash box).<ref>{{Cite web|title=South Australia License class information|url=http://www.sa.gov.au/topics/transport-travel-and-motoring|publisher=Gov't of South Australia|accessdate=28 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz LKW Lenkrad.jpg|thumb|Inside a Mercedes-Benz truck]]\nDriving licensing has been harmonized throughout the European Union (and practically all European non-member states), so that common, albeit complex rules apply within Europe (see [[European driving licence]]). As an overview, to drive a vehicle weighing more than {{convert|7.5|t|lbs|-2|order=same|abbr=on}} for commercial purposes requires a specialist license (the type varies depending on the use of the vehicle and number of seats). For licenses first acquired after 1997, that weight was reduced to {{convert|3.5|t|lbs|-2|order=same|abbr=on}}, not including trailers.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== India ===\nThere are around 50&nbsp;[[lakh]]s (5&nbsp;million) truck drivers in India.<ref>\"[http://www2.dw-world.de/southasia/South_Asia/1.234233.1.html Indian Truckers Strike to Protest Against Fuel Price Hike]\".

Furthermore, if the vehicle exceeds  {{convert|16|t|lbs|-2|order=same|abbr=on}} a code C  license becomes necessary.\n\nTo drive any vehicle in South Africa towing a trailer with a GVM more than {{convert|7.5|t|lbs|-2|order=same|abbr=on}}, further restrictions  apply and the driver must possess a license suitable for the GVM of the total combination as well as an articulated endorsement. This is indicated with the letter \"E\" prefixing the license code.\n\nIn addition, any vehicle designed to carry goods or passengers may only be driven by a driver possessing  a Public Driver's Permit, (or PrDP) of the applicable type.  This is an additional license that is added to the DL card of the operator and subject to annual renewal unlike the five-year renewal period of a normal license.\n\nThe requirements  for obtaining the different classes are below.\n\n* \"G\": Required  for the transport of general goods, requires  a criminal record check and a fee on issuing and renewal. \n* \"P\": Required  for the transport of paying passengers, requires a more stringent criminal record check on, additionally the driver must be over the age of 21 at time of issue. A G class PrDP  will be issued at the same time.\n* \"D\": Required for the transport of dangerous materials,  requires all of the same checks as class P. In addition the driver must be over 25 at time of issue.\n\n=== United States ===\n[[File:Truck cab.JPG|thumb|Inside a Navistar 9000]]\nIn the United States, a [[commercial driver's license]] is required to drive any type of commercial vehicle weighing {{convert|26001|lb|t|1|abbr=on}} or more.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Commercial Drivers License|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/enforce/cvm/CMV_license.html|publisher=[[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]|accessdate=21 May 2008}}</ref> The federal government regulates how many hours a driver may be on the clock, how much rest and sleep time is required (e.g., 11 hours driving/14 hours on-duty followed by 10 hours off, with a maximum of 70 hours/8 days or 60 hours/7 days, 34 hours restart )<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/hours-service/summary-hours-service-regulations|title=Hours of Service Rules|publisher=US Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration|date=18 December 2014|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref> Violations are often subject to significant penalties.

Continuous sounds are those from [[tire]]s rolling on the roadway, and the constant hum of their diesel engines at highway speeds. Less frequent noises, but perhaps more noticeable, are things like the repeated sharp-pitched whistle of a [[turbocharger]] on acceleration, or the abrupt blare of an [[exhaust brake]] [[retarder (mechanical engineering)|retarder]] when traversing a downgrade.

Rules on use taxes differ among jurisdictions.\n\n===Damage to pavement===\nThe life of a pavement is measured by the number of passes of a vehicle axle. It may be evaluated using the Load Equivalency Factor,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nvfnorden.org/lisalib/getfile.aspx?itemid=261|title=Road wear from heavy vehicles \u2013 an overview|publisher=NVF committee Vehicles and Transports|date=August 2008|accessdate=27 September 2016|format=PDF}}</ref> which states that the damage by the pass of a vehicle axle is proportional to the 4th power of the weight, so a ten-ton axle consumes 10,000 times the life of the pavement as a one-ton axle. For that reason, loaded trucks cost the same as thousands of cars in pavement costs, and are subject to higher taxes and highway tolls.\n\n===Commercial insurance===\nPrimary liability insurance coverage protects the truck from damage or injuries to other people as a result of a truck accident. This truck insurance coverage is mandated by U.S.&nbsp;state and federal agencies, and proof of coverage is required to be sent to them. Interstate trucks in the U.S. are required to have a minimum of $75,000 in liability insurance. This includes motor carriers operating vehicles with a gross weight rating in excess of {{convert|10000|lb|t|1|abbr=on}} (which transport non-hazardous materials). All motor carriers operating vehicles transporting materials classified as hazardous, and which have a gross weight rating in excess of {{convert|10000|lb|t|1|abbr=on}} must have a minimum of $1,000,000 in liability insurance. All motor carriers operating vehicles such as hopper-type cargo vehicles or tankers with a capacity in excess of {{convert|3500|usgal|l|abbr=on}} must have a minimum of $5,000,000 in liability insurance. Pricing is dependent on region, driving records, and history of the trucking operation.\n\nMotor truck cargo insurance protects the transporter for his responsibility in the event of damaged or lost freight. The policy is purchased with a maximum load limit per vehicle. Cargo insurance coverage limits can range from $10,000 to $100,000 or more. Pricing for this insurance is mainly dependent on the type of cargo being hauled.\n\n===Trucking accidents===\n[[File:Elst (Overbetuwe) 2012-03-23 Trucking accident (1).JPG|thumb|Trucking accident at [[Elst, Overbetuwe|Elst (Netherlands)]] 2012-03-23]]\nIn 2002 and 2004, there were over 5,000 fatalities related to trucking accidents in the United States. The trucking industry has since made significant efforts in increasing safety regulations. In 2008 the industry had successfully lowered the fatality rate to just over 4,000 deaths. But trucking accidents are still an issue that causes thousands of deaths and injuries each year. Approximately 6,000 trucking accident fatalities occur annually in the United States. Fatalities are not the only issue caused by trucking accidents. Here are some of the environmental issues that arise with trucking accidents:\n* 14.4% of trucking accidents cause cargo to spill\n* 6.5% cause open flames\n\nFollowing increased pressure from ''The Times'' \"Cities Fit For Cycling\" campaign and from other media in Spring 2012, warning signs are now displayed on the backs of many HGVs.
