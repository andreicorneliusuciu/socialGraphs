In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only [[wood]]y plants with [[secondary growth]], plants that are usable as [[lumber]] or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller [[Arecaceae|palms]], the [[Cyatheales|tree ferns]], [[banana]]s and [[bamboo]]s are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a [[Sequoia sempervirens|coast redwood]] named [[Hyperion (tree)|Hyperion]], stands {{convert|115.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.<ref name=Crowther/>\n\nA tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk. This trunk typically contains [[woody tissue]] for strength, and [[vascular tissue]] to carry materials from one part of the tree to another. For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of [[bark]] which serves as a protective barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil. Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots. The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into sugars by [[photosynthesis]], providing the food for the tree's growth and development. Flowers and fruit may also be present, but some trees, such as conifers, instead have pollen cones and seed cones; others, such as tree ferns, produce [[spore]]s instead.\n\nTrees play a significant role in reducing [[Soil erosion|erosion]] and moderating the [[climate]]. They remove [[carbon dioxide]] from the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] and store large quantities of [[carbon]] in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of animals and plants. [[Tropical rainforest]]s are one of the most [[Biodiversity|biodiverse]] habitats in the world. Trees provide shade and shelter, timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food as well as having many other uses. In parts of the world, forests are shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available for agriculture. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always been revered, with [[sacred grove]]s in various cultures, and they play a role in many of the world's [[mythology|mythologies]].\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Tree secondary growth diagram.jpg|thumb|Diagram of [[secondary growth]] in a [[eudicot]] or [[coniferous]] tree showing idealised vertical and horizontal sections.

The vascular system of trees allows water, nutrients and other chemicals to be distributed around the plant, and without it trees would not be able to grow as large as they do. Trees, as relatively tall plants, need to draw water up the stem through the xylem from the roots by the suction produced as water evaporates from the leaves. If insufficient water is available the leaves will die.<ref name=Transport>{{cite web | url=http://cronodon.com/BioTech/Plant_Transport.html | title=Transport in plants | date=2007-01-28 | work=BioTech | publisher=Cronodon Museum | accessdate=2012-07-21}}</ref> The three main parts of trees include the root, stem, and leaves; they are integral parts of the vascular system which interconnects all the living cells. In trees and other plants that develop wood, the [[vascular cambium]] allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth. Because this growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also have a [[cork cambium]] that develops among the phloem. The cork cambium gives rise to thickened cork cells to protect the surface of the plant and reduce water loss. Both the production of wood and the production of cork are forms of secondary growth.<ref name=Coder>{{cite web | url=http://warnell.forestry.uga.edu/SERVICE/LIBRARY/index.php3?docID=171 | archiveurl=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20140908112429/http://warnell.forestry.uga.edu/SERVICE/LIBRARY/index.php3?docID=171 | archivedate=2014-09-08 | title=Secondary Growth Anatomy and Tree Rings | author=Coder, Kim D. | publisher=Warnell School of Forest Resources, University of Georgia | date=1999-08-01 | accessdate=2014-09-08}}</ref>\n\nTrees are either [[evergreen]], having foliage that persists and remains green throughout the year,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/evergreen | title=Evergreen | work=TheFreeDictionary | accessdate=2012-08-07}}</ref> or [[deciduous]], shedding their leaves at the end of the growing season and then having a dormant period without foliage.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/deciduous | title=Deciduous | work=TheFreeDictionary | accessdate=2012-08-07}}</ref> Most conifers are evergreens but larches (''[[Larix]]'' and ''[[Pseudolarix]]'') are deciduous, dropping their needles each autumn, and some species of cypress (''[[Glyptostrobus]]'', ''[[Metasequoia]]'' and ''[[Taxodium]]'') shed small leafy shoots annually in a process known as [[cladoptosis]].<ref name=treedictionary/> The [[Crown (botany)|crown]] is a name for the spreading top of a tree including the branches and leaves,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/crown | title=Crown | work=TheFreeDictionary | accessdate=2012-08-07}}</ref> while the uppermost layer in a forest, formed by the crowns of the trees, is known as the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/canopy | title=Canopy | work=TheFreeDictionary | accessdate=2012-08-07}}</ref> A sapling is a young tree.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sapling | title=Sapling | work=TheFreeDictionary | accessdate=2012-08-07}}</ref>\n\nMany tall palms are herbaceous<ref name=\"eeb.ucla.edu\">{{cite web | url=https://www.eeb.ucla.edu/Faculty/Gibson/Santa_Monica_Mountains_plants/Glossary_UCLA_SantaMonicas.pdf | title=Detailed Scientific Descriptions, from A Naturalist's Flora of the Santa Monica Mountains and Simi Hills, California | publisher=National Park Service | accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref> monocots; these do not undergo secondary growth and never produce wood.<ref name=\"botany.wisc.edu\"/><ref name=\"RoddStackhouse2008\"/> In many tall palms, the terminal bud on the main stem is the only one to develop, so they have unbranched trunks with large spirally arranged leaves.

It provides a thick, waterproof covering to the living inner tissue. It protects the trunk against the elements, disease, animal attack and fire. It is perforated by a large number of fine breathing pores called [[lenticel]]s, through which oxygen diffuses. Bark is continually replaced by a living layer of cells called the cork cambium. The [[Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia|London plane]] (''Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia'') periodically sheds its bark in large flakes. Similarly, the bark of the [[Betula pendula|silver birch]] (''Betula pendula'') peels off in strips. As the tree's girth expands, newer layers of bark are larger in circumference, and the older layers develop fissures in many species. In some trees such as the [[pine]] (''Pinus'' species) the bark exudes sticky [[resin]] which deters attackers whereas in [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber trees]] (''Hevea brasiliensis'') it is a milky [[latex]] that oozes out.

These lay their eggs in crevices and the larvae chew their way through the cellulose tissues leaving a gallery of tunnels. This may allow fungal spores to gain admittance and attack the tree. [[Dutch elm disease]] is caused by a fungus (''[[Ophiostoma]]'' species) carried from one [[elm]] tree to another by various beetles. The tree reacts to the growth of the fungus by blocking off the xylem tissue carrying sap upwards and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of nourishment and dies.

The conductive cells of the heartwood are blocked in some species, and the surrounding cells are more often dead. Heartwood is usually darker in colour than the sapwood. It is the dense central core of the trunk giving it rigidity. Three quarters of the dry mass of the xylem is [[cellulose]], a [[polysaccharide]], and most of the remainder is lignin, a complex [[polymer]].

This pattern of growth is related to climatic conditions; growth normally ceases when conditions are either too cold or too dry. In readiness for the inactive period, trees form [[bud]]s to protect the [[meristem]], the zone of active growth. Before the period of dormancy, the last few leaves produced at the tip of a twig form scales. These are thick, small and closely wrapped and enclose the growing point in a waterproof sheath. Inside this bud there is a rudimentary stalk and neatly folded miniature leaves, ready to expand when the next growing season arrives. Buds also form in the [[Axil|axils]] of the leaves ready to produce new side shoots. A few trees, such as the [[eucalyptus]], have \"naked buds\" with no protective scales and some conifers, such as the [[Chamaecyparis lawsoniana|Lawson's cypress]], have no buds but instead have little pockets of meristem concealed among the scale-like leaves.<ref name=buds>{{cite book | title=The World Encyclopedia of Trees | last=Russell | first=Tony |author2=Cutler, Catherine  | year=2003 | publisher=Lorenz Books | isbn=0-7548-1292-8 | pages=18\u201319 }}</ref>\n\nWhen growing conditions improve, such as the arrival of warmer weather and the longer days associated with spring in temperate regions, growth starts again. The expanding shoot pushes its way out, shedding the scales in the process. These leave behind scars on the surface of the twig. The whole year's growth may take place in just a few weeks. The new stem is unlignified at first and may be green and downy. The Arecaceae (palms) have their leaves spirally arranged on an unbranched trunk.<ref name=buds/> In some tree species in temperate climates, a second spurt of growth, a [[Lammas growth]] may occur which is believed to be a strategy to compensate for loss of early foliage to insect predators.<ref>{{cite journal | journal=Journal of Experimental Botany | volume=54 | issue=389 | pages=1797\u20131799 | date=August 2003 | doi=10.1093/jxb/erg225 | title=August-learning about summer | last1=Battey | first1=N.

They are an important investment by the tree and may be thorny or contain [[phytolith]]s, [[lignin]]s, [[tannin]]s or [[poison]]s to discourage herbivory. Trees have evolved leaves in a wide range of shapes and sizes, in response to environmental pressures including climate and predation. They can be broad or needle-like, simple or compound, lobed or entire, smooth or hairy, delicate or tough, deciduous or evergreen. The needles of coniferous trees are compact but are structurally similar to those of broad-leaved trees. They are adapted for life in environments where resources are low or water is scarce. Frozen ground may limit water availability and conifers are often found in colder places at higher altitudes and higher latitudes than broad leaved trees. In conifers such as fir trees, the branches hang down at an angle to the trunk, enabling them to shed snow. In contrast, broad leaved trees in temperate regions deal with winter weather by shedding their leaves. When the days get shorter and the temperature begins to decrease, the leaves no longer make new [[chlorophyll]] and the red and yellow pigments already present in the blades become apparent.<ref>{{cite book | author=Pessarakli, Mohammad | title=Handbook of Photosynthesis | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0_3XqlcKPpwC&pg=PA725 | year=2005 | publisher=CRC Press | isbn=978-0-8247-5839-4 | pages=717\u2013739 }}</ref> Synthesis in the leaf of a [[plant hormone]] called [[auxin]] also ceases.

They are grown for the beauty of their forms, their foliage, flowers, fruit and bark and their siting is of major importance in creating a landscape. They can be grouped informally, often surrounded by plantings of bulbs, laid out in stately avenues or used as specimen trees. As living things, their appearance changes with the season and from year to year.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Royal Horticultural Society Encyclopedia of Gardening |last=Brickell |first=Christopher (ed.) |year=1992 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |chapter=Ornamental trees |isbn=978-0-86318-979-1 |pages=32\u201333 }}</ref>\n\nTrees are often planted in town environments where they are known as street trees or amenity trees. They can provide shade and cooling through [[evapotranspiration]], absorb greenhouse gasses and pollutants, intercept rainfall and reduce the risk of flooding. It has been shown that they are beneficial to humans in creating a sense of well-being and reducing stress. Many towns have initiated tree-planting programmes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/fr/urgc-7EKEC8 |title=Street trees |work=Greenspace initiative |publisher=Forestry Commission |accessdate=2014-09-20}}</ref> In London for example, there is an initiative to plant 20,000 new street trees and to have an increase in tree cover of 5% by 2025, equivalent to one tree for every resident.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.london.gov.uk/WHAT-WE-DO/environment/parks-green-spaces-and-biodiversity/releaf-partnership |title=RE:LEAF |work=Greening London |publisher=Mayor of London |accessdate=2014-09-20}}</ref>\n\n===Other uses===\n[[File:Latex dripping.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Latex]] collecting from a [[Hevea brasiliensis|Rubber tree (''Hevea brasiliensis'')]]]]\n{{further information|Resin|Latex|Camphor}}\n\nLatex is a sticky defensive secretion that protects plants against [[herbivore]]s. Many trees produce it when injured but the main source of the latex used to make [[natural rubber]] is the Par\u00e1 rubber tree (''Hevea brasiliensis''). Originally used to create bouncy balls and for the waterproofing of cloth, natural rubber is now mainly used in tyres for which synthetic materials have proved less durable.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=2101 | title=Natural rubber: History and Developments in the Natural Rubber Industry | author=Baker, C | year=1997 | work=Materials World | publisher=AZoM.com | accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref> The latex exuded by the balat\u00e1 tree (''[[Manilkara bidentata]]'') is used to make [[golf ball]]s and is similar to [[gutta-percha]], made from the latex of the \"getah perca\" tree ''[[Palaquium]]''. This is also used as an insulator, particularly of undersea cables, and in dentistry, walking sticks and gun butts. It has now largely been replaced by synthetic materials.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Article/GuttaPercha/ | title=The Gutta Percha Company | author=Burns, Bill | date=2010-02-15 | work=History of the Atlantic Cable and Undersea Communications | accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref>\n\nResin is another plant exudate that may have a defensive purpose. It is a viscous liquid composed mainly of volatile [[terpene]]s and is produced mostly by coniferous trees. It is used in varnishes, for making small castings and in [[ten-pin bowling]] balls. When heated, the terpenes are driven off and the remaining product is called \"rosin\" and is used by stringed instrumentalists on their [[Bow (music)|bows]]. Some resins contain [[essential oil]]s and are used in [[incense]] and [[aromatherapy]]. Fossilised resin is known as amber and was mostly formed in the Cretaceous (145 to 66 million years ago) or more recently. The resin that oozed out of trees sometimes trapped insects or spiders and these are still visible in the interior of the amber.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://gurukul.ucc.american.edu/ted/amber.htm | title=Amber Trade and the Environment in the Kaliningrad Oblast | author=Jacobson, Douglas | year=1997 | work=The Mandala Projects | accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref>\n\nThe camphor tree (''[[Cinnamomum camphora]]'') produces an essential oil <ref name=spices/> and the eucalyptus tree (''[[Eucalyptus globulus]]'') is the main source of [[eucalyptus oil]] which is used in medicine, as a fragrance and in industry.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/v5350e/v5350e07.htm | publisher = Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations | title = Chapter 5: Eucalyptus oil | work=Flavours and fragrances of plant origin | accessdate=2015-03-19}}</ref>\n\n==Care==\nDead trees pose a safety risk, especially during high winds and severe storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas the presence of healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and reduce the temperature of the built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into [[water stress]], which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death. Irrigation can be accomplished by use of a [[garden hose]], soaker hose, [[Irrigation sprinkler|sprinkler]], or modified five-gallon bucket.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://texasforestservice.tamu.edu/AftertheStorm/Drought/ | title=Texas drought | work=Texas A&M Forest Service | publisher=Texas A&M University System | accessdate=2012-09-10}}</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\n{{main article|Tree worship}}\n[[File:yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Yggdrasil]], the World Ash of [[Norse mythology]]]]\n\nTrees have been venerated since time immemorial.

Other cultures have similarly revered trees, often linking the lives and fortunes of individuals to them or using them as oracles. In [[Greek mythology]], [[dryad]]s were believed to be shy nymphs who inhabited trees.\n\nThe [[Oubangui]] people of west Africa plant a tree when a child is born. As the tree flourishes, so does the child but if the tree fails to thrive, the health of the child is considered at risk. When it flowers it is time for marriage. Gifts are left at the tree periodically and when the individual dies, their spirit is believed to live on in the tree.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/t9450e/t9450e06.htm | title=The cultural and symbolic importance of forest resources | publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations | accessdate=2012-07-29}}</ref>\n\nTrees have their roots in the ground and their trunk and branches extended towards the sky.
