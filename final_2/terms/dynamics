anomalous dynamics are either faster than normal dynamics (''MSD''>''t'') or slower (''MSD''<''t'')\n** Astrodynamics, also known as [[Orbital mechanics]] for both near earth and planetary motion (also called [[Celestial mechanics]] when used in that sense).\n** [[Brownian dynamics]], the occurrence of Langevin dynamics in the motion of particles in solution (e.g. a grain in water, as was first seen by Brown); its famous property is: ''MSD''~''t'', where ''MSD'' is the mean squared displacement, and ''t'' is the time the process is seen\n** [[File dynamics]], stochastic motion of particles in a channel\n** [[Flight dynamics]], the science of aircraft and spacecraft design\n** [[Fluid dynamics]] or ''hydrodynamics'', the study of fluid flow\n*** [[Computational fluid dynamics]], a way of studying fluid dynamics using numerical methods\n** [[Fractional dynamics]], studies the dynamics with integrations and differentiations of fractional orders (in physics, economics, and related fields)\n** [[Molecular dynamics]], the study of motion on the molecular level\n** Normal dynamics, is a stochastic motion having a Gaussian probability density function in position with variance ''MSD'' that follows, ''MSD''~''t'', where ''MSD'' is the mean squared displacement of the process, and ''t'' is the time the process is seen (normal dynamics and [[Brownian dynamics]] are very similar; the term used depends on the field)\n** [[Langevin dynamics]], a mathematical model for stochastic dynamics; used in modeling molecules, stock market, neuronal membrane potentials and other systems \n** [[Quantum chromodynamics]], a theory of the strong interaction (color force)\n** [[Quantum electrodynamics]], a description of how matter and light interact\n** [[Relativistic dynamics]], a combination of relativistic and quantum concepts\n** Single file dynamics (also termed [[file dynamics]]), the diffusion of particles in a channel\n** [[Stellar dynamics]], a description of the collective motion of stars\n** [[System dynamics]], the study of the behavior of complex systems\n** [[Thermodynamics]], the study of the relationships between heat and mechanical energy\n\n== Sociology and psychology ==\n\n* [[Group dynamics]], the study of social group processes especially \n* [[Psychodynamics]], the study of the underlying psychological forces driving human behaviour\n* [[Spiral Dynamics]], a social development theory\n* [[Social dynamics]], the ability of a society to react to changes\n\n== Computer science and mathematics ==\n\n* Dynamic [[data structure]], a structure where the data elements may change\n* [[Dynamical system]], a concept describing a point's time dependency\n** [[Symbolic dynamics]], a method to model dynamical systems\n* [[Dynamic programming]], a method of solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler steps\n* [[Dynamic program analysis]],  a set of methods for analyzing computer software\n* [[Dynamic HTML]], an umbrella term for a collection of technologies used together to create interactive and animated web sites\n* [[Dynamic web page]], a web page with web content that varies based on parameters provided by a user or a computer program\n\n== Companies ==\n\n* [[Arrow Dynamics]], roller coaster designer\n* [[Boston Dynamics]], robot designer\n* [[Crystal Dynamics]], video game developer\n* [[Dynamic (company)]], commercial catering appliance company\n* [[General Dynamics]], defence contractor\n* [[Dynamic (record label)]]\n\n== Other ==\n\n* [[Dynamics (music)]], the softness or loudness of a sound or note\n* [[Force Dynamics]], a semantic concept about how entities interact with reference to force\n* [[Microsoft Dynamics]], a line of business software\n* [[Neural oscillation]] in the field of ''neurodynamics'', a rhythmic pattern in the brain\n* [[Population dynamics]], in life sciences, the changes in the composition of a population\n* [[Microphone#Dynamic microphone|Dynamic microphone]], a type of microphone\n* [[DTA Dynamic]], a French ultralight trike wing design\n* [[Sol Dynamic]], A Brazilian paraglider design\n\n== See also ==\n* {{lookfrom|dynamic}}\n* {{intitle|dynamic}}\n* [[Power (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Kinetics (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Static (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]]\n\n{{disambiguation}}"}]}}}}
