Ltd., 2007 ISBN 81-203-3191-5, page 61, describing the iAPX 432.</ref> The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, [[Processor register|register]] based, [[Computer program|programmable]] electronic device which accepts [[digital data|digital]] or [[binary code|binary]] data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and [[sequential logic|sequential digital logic]]. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the [[binary numeral system]].\n\nThe integration of a whole CPU onto a single [[Integrated circuit|chip]] or on a few chips greatly reduced the cost of processing power. Integrated circuit processors are produced in large numbers by highly automated processes resulting in a low per unit cost. Single-chip processors increase reliability as there are many fewer electrical connections to fail. As microprocessor designs get faster, the cost of manufacturing a chip (with smaller components built on a semiconductor chip the same size) generally stays the same.\n\nBefore microprocessors, small computers had been built using racks of circuit boards with many [[medium-scale integration|medium-]] and [[small-scale integration|small-scale]] integrated circuits. Microprocessors combined this into one or a few [[large-scale integration|large-scale]] ICs. Continued increases in microprocessor capacity have since rendered other forms of computers almost completely obsolete (see [[history of computing hardware]]), with one or more microprocessors used in everything from the smallest [[embedded system]]s and [[handheld device]]s to the largest [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]]s and [[supercomputer]]s.\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:Z80 arch.svg|thumb|A block diagram of the  architecture of the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] microprocessor, showing the arithmetic and logic section, register file, control logic section, and buffers to external address and data lines]]\n\nThe internal arrangement of a '''microprocessor''' varies depending on the age of the design and the intended purposes of the microprocessor. The complexity of an integrated circuit (IC) is bounded by physical limitations of the number of [[transistors]] that can be put onto one chip, the number of package terminations that can connect the processor to other parts of the system, the number of interconnections it is possible to make on the chip, and the heat that the chip can dissipate. Advancing technology makes more complex and powerful chips feasible to manufacture.\n\nA minimal hypothetical microprocessor might only include an [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU) and a control logic section. The ALU performs operations such as addition, subtraction, and operations such as AND or OR. Each operation of the ALU sets one or more flags in a status register, which indicate the results of the last operation (zero value, negative number, overflow, or others). The control logic retrieves instruction codes from memory and initiates the sequence of operations required for the ALU to carry out the instruction. A single [[operation code]] might affect many individual data paths, registers, and other elements of the processor.\n\nAs integrated circuit technology advanced, it was feasible to manufacture more and more complex processors on a single chip. The size of data objects became larger; allowing more transistors on a chip allowed word sizes to increase from [[4-bit|4-]] and [[8-bit]] words up to today's [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] words. Additional features were added to the processor architecture; more on-chip registers sped up programs, and complex instructions could be used to make more compact programs. Floating-point arithmetic, for example, was often not available on 8-bit microprocessors, but had to be carried out in software. Integration of the [[floating point unit]] first as a separate integrated circuit and then as part of the same microprocessor chip, sped up floating point calculations.\n\nOccasionally, physical limitations of integrated circuits made such practices as a [[Bit slicing|bit slice]] approach necessary. Instead of processing all of a long word on one integrated circuit, multiple circuits in parallel processed subsets of each data word. While this required extra logic to handle, for example, carry and overflow within each slice, the result was a system that could handle, for example, [[32-bit]] words using integrated circuits with a capacity for only four&nbsp;bits each.\n\nWith the ability to put large numbers of transistors on one chip, it becomes feasible to integrate memory on the same die as the processor. This [[CPU cache]] has the advantage of faster access than off-chip memory, and increases the processing speed of the system for many applications. Processor clock frequency has increased more rapidly than external memory speed, except in the recent past,{{When|date=September 2016}} so cache memory is necessary if the processor is not delayed by slower external memory.\n\n===Special-purpose designs===\nA microprocessor is a general purpose system. Several specialized processing devices have followed from the technology:\n\n* A [[digital signal processor]] (DSP) is specialized for signal processing.\n* [[Graphics processing unit]]s (GPUs) are processors designed primarily for realtime rendering of 3D images. They may be fixed function (as was more common in the 1990s), or support programmable [[shader]]s. With the continuing rise of [[GPGPU]], GPUs are evolving into increasingly general purpose [[stream processing|stream processor]]s (running [[compute kernel|compute shader]]s), whilst retaining hardware assist for rasterizing, but still differ from CPUs in that they are optimized for throughput over latency, and are not suitable for running application or OS code.\n* Other specialized units exist for [[video processing]] and [[vision processing unit|machine vision]].\n* [[Microcontroller]]s integrate a microprocessor with peripheral devices in embedded systems. These tend to have different tradeoffs compared to CPUs.\n\n32-bit processors have more digital logic than narrower processors, so 32-bit (and wider) processors produce more digital noise and have higher static consumption than narrower processors.<ref>Kristian Saether, Ingar Fredriksen.\n[http://www.atmel.com/images/doc7926.pdf \"Introducing a New Breed of Microcontrollers for 8/16-bit  Applications\"].\n</ref>\nReducing digital noise improves ADC conversion results.<ref>[http://www.st.com/web/en/resource/technical/document/application_note/CD00004444.pdf \"AN1636: Understanding and minimising ADC conversion errors\"].\n2003.\n</ref><ref>Rahul Singh et al.\n[https://www.google.com/patents/US7515076 \"Method and apparatus for reducing switching noise in a system-on-chip (SoC) integrated circuit including an analog-to-digital converter (ADC)\"].\n2009.\n</ref>\nSo, 8- or [[16-bit]] processors are better than 32-bit processors for [[system on a chip]] and microcontrollers that require extremely [[low-power electronics]], or are part of a [[mixed-signal integrated circuit]] with noise-sensitive on-chip analog electronics such as high-resolution analog to digital converters, or both.\n\nNevertheless, trade-offs apply: running 32-bit arithmetic on an 8-bit chip could end up using more power, as the chip must execute software with multiple instructions. Modern microprocessors go into low power states when possible,<ref>{{cite web|title=Managing the Impact of Increasing Microprocessor Power Consumption |url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~mobile/elec518/readings/Intel/gunther01power.pdf|work=[[Rice University]]|accessdate=October 1, 2015}}</ref> and a 8-bit chip running 32-bit software is active most of the time. This creates a delicate balance between software, hardware and use patterns, plus costs.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nWhen manufactured on a similar process, 8-bit microprocessors use less power when operating and less power when sleeping than 32-bit microprocessors.<ref name=\"cmicrotek\">CMicrotek.\n[http://cmicrotek.com/wordpress_159256135/?p=22 \"8-bit vs 32-bit Micros\"].\n2013.\n</ref>\n\nHowever, some people say a 32-bit microprocessor may use less average power than an 8-bit microprocessor when the application requires certain operations such as floating-point math\nthat take many more clock cycles on an 8-bit microprocessor than a 32-bit microprocessor so the 8-bit microprocessor spends more time in high-power operating mode.<ref name=\"cmicrotek\" /><ref>Richard York.\n[http://community.arm.com/groups/processors/blog/2012/09/24/8-bit-versus-32-bit-mcus--the-impassioned-debate-goes-on \"8-bit versus 32-bit MCUs - The impassioned debate goes on\"].\n</ref><ref>[http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/lowpower/pages/32-bit-microcontroller-technology.aspx \"32-bit Microcontroller Technology: Reduced processing time\"].\n</ref><ref>[http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m3.php?tab=Moving+from+8/16-bit \"Cortex-M3 Processor: Energy efficiency advantage\"].\n</ref>\n\n==Embedded applications==\nThousands of items that were traditionally not computer-related include microprocessors. These include large and small household [[home appliance|appliance]]s, cars (and their accessory equipment units), car keys, tools and test instruments, toys, light switches/dimmers and [[Arc-fault circuit interrupter|electrical circuit breakers]], smoke alarms, battery packs, and hi-fi audio/visual components (from [[DVD]] players to [[Phonograph#Turntable technology|phonograph turntables]]). Such products as cellular telephones, [[DVD video]] system and [[HDTV]] broadcast systems fundamentally require consumer devices with powerful, low-cost, microprocessors. Increasingly stringent pollution control standards effectively require automobile manufacturers to use microprocessor engine management systems, to allow optimal control of emissions over widely varying operating conditions of an automobile. Non-programmable controls would require complex, bulky, or costly implementation to achieve the results possible with a microprocessor.\n\nA microprocessor control program ([[embedded software]]) can be easily tailored to different needs of a product line, allowing upgrades in performance with minimal redesign of the product. Different features can be implemented in different models of a product line at negligible production cost.\n\nMicroprocessor control of a system can provide control strategies that would be impractical to implement using electromechanical controls or purpose-built electronic controls. For example, an engine control system in an automobile can adjust ignition timing based on engine speed, load on the engine, ambient temperature, and any observed tendency for knocking\u2014allowing an automobile to operate on a range of fuel grades.\n\n==History==\nThe advent of low-cost computers on integrated circuits has transformed modern society. General-purpose microprocessors in [[personal computer]]s are used for computation, text editing, multimedia display, and communication over the [[Internet]]. Many more microprocessors are part of [[embedded system]]s, providing digital control over myriad objects from appliances to automobiles to [[cellular phone]]s and industrial process control.\n\nThe first use of the term \"microprocessor\" is attributed to [[Viatron|Viatron Computer Systems]] describing the custom integrated circuit used in their System 21 small computer system announced in 1968.\n\nBy the late-1960s, designers were striving to integrate the central processing unit (CPU) functions of a computer onto a handful of MOS LSI chips, called microprocessor unit (MPU) chip sets. Building on [[8-bit]] arithmetic logic units (3800/3804) he designed earlier at Fairchild, in 1969, Lee Boysel created the Four-Phase Systems Inc. AL-1 an 8-bit CPU slice that was expandable to 32-bits. In 1970, Steve Geller and Ray Holt of Garrett AiResearch designed the MP944 chip set to implement the F-14A Central Air Data Computer on six metal-gate chips fabricated by AMI.\n\nIntel introduced its first [[4-bit]] microprocessor 4004 in 1971, and its 8-bit microprocessor 8008 in 1972. During the 1960s, computer processors were constructed out of small and medium-scale ICs\u2014each containing from tens of [[transistors]] to a few hundred. These were placed and soldered onto printed circuit boards, and often multiple boards were interconnected in a chassis. The large number of discrete [[logic gate]]s used more electrical power\u2014and therefore produced more heat\u2014than a more integrated design with fewer ICs. The distance that signals had to travel between ICs on the boards limited a computer's operating speed.\n\nIn the [[NASA]] Apollo space missions to the [[moon]] in the 1960s and 1970s, all onboard computations for primary guidance, navigation and control were provided by a small custom processor called \"The [[Apollo Guidance Computer]]\". It used wire wrap circuit boards whose only [[logic gate|logic element]]s were three-input [[NOR gate]]s.<ref>[http://klabs.org/richcontent/verification/80k85_verification/index.htm Back to the Moon: The Verification of a Small Microprocessor's Logic Design] - [[NASA]] Office of Logic Design</ref>\n\nThe first microprocessors emerged in the early 1970s, and were used for electronic [[calculator]]s, using [[binary-coded decimal]] (BCD) arithmetic on 4-bit [[word (data type)|words]].<!-- Really? These were mostly dedicated calculator chips, not general-purpose microprocessors. --> Other [[embedded system|embedded]] uses of 4-bit and 8-bit microprocessors, such as [[computer terminal|terminal]]s, [[computer printer|printer]]s, various kinds of [[automation]] etc., followed soon after. Affordable 8-bit microprocessors with [[16-bit]] addressing also led to the first general-purpose [[microcomputer]]s from the mid-1970s on.\n\nSince the early 1970s, the increase in capacity of microprocessors has followed [[Moore's law]]; this originally suggested that the number of components that can be fitted onto a chip doubles every year. With present technology, it is actually every two years,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Gordon|title=Cramming more components onto integrated circuits|journal=Electronics|volume=38|issue=8|date=19 April 1965|url=ftp://download.intel.com/museum/Moores_Law/Articles-Press_Releases/Gordon_Moore_1965_Article.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-12-23}}</ref> and as such Moore later changed the period to two years.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Excerpts from A Conversation with Gordon Moore: Moore's Law|publisher=Intel|year=2005|url=ftp://download.intel.com/museum/Moores_Law/Video-Transcripts/Excepts_A_Conversation_with_Gordon_Moore.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-12-23}}</ref>\n\n===First projects===\nThree projects delivered a microprocessor at about the same time: [[Garrett AiResearch]]'s [[Central Air Data Computer]] (CADC), [[Texas Instruments]] (TI) TMS 1000 (1971 September), and [[Intel]]'s [[Intel 4004|4004]] (1971 November).\n\n====CADC====\n{{Primary sources|section|date=March 2010}}\n{{Details|Central Air Data Computer}}\n\nIn 1968, [[Garrett AiResearch]] (which employed designers [[Ray Holt]] and Steve Geller) was invited to produce a digital computer to compete with [[electromechanical]] systems then under development for the main flight control computer in the [[US Navy]]'s new [[F-14 Tomcat]] fighter. The design was complete by 1970, and used a [[MOSFET|MOS]]-based chipset as the core CPU. The design was significantly (approximately 20 times) smaller and much more reliable than the mechanical systems it competed against, and was used in all of the early Tomcat models. This system contained \"a 20-bit, [[Pipeline (computing)|pipelined]], [[Parallel computing|parallel]] [[multiprocessor|multi-microprocessor]]\". The Navy refused to allow publication of the design until 1997.

Busicom's original design called for a programmable chip set consisting of seven different chips. Three of the chips were to make a special-purpose CPU with its program stored in ROM and its data stored in shift register read-write memory. [[Ted Hoff]], the Intel engineer assigned to evaluate the project, believed the Busicom design could be simplified by using dynamic RAM storage for data, rather than shift register memory, and a more traditional general-purpose CPU architecture. Hoff came up with a four-chip architectural proposal: a ROM chip for storing the programs, a dynamic RAM chip for storing data, a simple I/O device and a 4-bit central processing unit (CPU). Although not a chip designer, he felt the CPU could be integrated into a single chip, but as he lacked the technical know-how the idea remained just a wish for the time being.\n\n[[File:Intel 4004.jpg|thumb|[[Intel 4004]], the first commercial microprocessor]]\n\nWhile the architecture and specifications of the MCS-4 came from the interaction of Hoff with [[Stanley Mazor]], a software engineer reporting to him, and with Busicom engineer [[Masatoshi Shima]], during 1969, Mazor and Hoff moved on to other projects. In April 1970, Intel hired Italian-born engineer [[Federico Faggin]] as project leader, a move that ultimately made the single-chip CPU final design a reality (Shima meanwhile designed the Busicom calculator firmware and assisted Faggin during the first six months of the implementation). Faggin, who originally developed the [[silicon gate]] technology (SGT) in 1968 at [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]<ref>{{cite conference | title=Insulated Gate Field Effect Transistor Integrated Circuits with Silicon Gates | last1=Faggin | first1=F. | last2=Klein | first2=T. | last3=Vadasz | first3=L. | conference=International Electronic Devices Meeting | publisher=IEEE Electron Devices Group | date=23 October 1968 | url=http://www.intel4004.com/images/iedm_covart.jpg | format=JPEG image | accessdate=2009-12-23}}</ref> and designed the world\u2019s first commercial integrated circuit using SGT, the Fairchild 3708, had the correct background to lead the project into what would become the first commercial general purpose microprocessor. Since SGT was his very own invention, Faggin also used it to create his new methodology for [[random logic]] design that made it possible to implement a single-chip CPU with the proper speed, power dissipation and cost. The manager of Intel's MOS Design Department was [[Leslie L. Vad\u00e1sz]] at the time of the MCS-4 development but Vad\u00e1sz's attention was completely focused on the mainstream business of semiconductor memories so he left the leadership and the management of the MCS-4 project to Faggin, who was ultimately responsible for leading the 4004 project to its realization.

The result of their work was the TMS 1000, which went on the market in 1974.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Most Widely Used Computer on a Chip: The TMS 1000|work=State of the Art: A Photographic History of the Integrated Circuit|last=Augarten|first=Stan|publisher=Ticknor & Fields|location=New Haven and New York|year=1983|isbn=0-89919-195-9|url=http://smithsonianchips.si.edu/augarten/p38.htm|accessdate=2009-12-23}}</ref>\nTI stressed the 4-bit TMS 1000 for use in pre-programmed embedded applications, introducing a version called the TMS1802NC on September 17, 1971 that implemented a calculator on a chip.\n\nTI filed for a patent on the microprocessor. Gary Boone was awarded {{US patent|3757306}} for the single-chip microprocessor architecture on September 4, 1973. In 1971, and again in 1976, Intel and TI entered into broad patent cross-licensing agreements, with Intel paying royalties to TI for the microprocessor patent. A history of these events is contained in court documentation from a legal dispute between Cyrix and Intel, with TI as inventor and owner of the microprocessor patent.\n\nA computer-on-a-chip combines the microprocessor core (CPU), memory, and I/O ([[input/output]]) lines onto one [[integrated circuit|chip]]. The computer-on-a-chip patent, called the \"microcomputer patent\" at the time, {{US patent|4074351}}, was awarded to Gary Boone and Michael J. Cochran of TI. Aside from this patent, the standard meaning of [[microcomputer]] is a computer using one or more microprocessors as its CPU(s), while the concept defined in the patent is more akin to a microcontroller.\n\n===8-bit designs===\n{{Refimprove|section and the sections below|date=June 2011}}\n\nThe Intel 4004 was followed in 1972 by the [[Intel 8008]], the world's first [[8-bit]] microprocessor. The 8008 was not, however, an extension of the 4004 design, but instead the culmination of a separate design project at Intel, arising from a contract with [[Datapoint|Computer Terminals Corporation]], of San Antonio TX, for a chip for a terminal they were designing,<ref name=\"mit-comp-history\">{{cite book | last = Ceruzzi | first = Paul E. | title = A History of Modern Computing | edition = 2nd |date=May 2003 | publisher = MIT Press | isbn = 0-262-53203-4 | pages = 220\u2013221 }}</ref> the [[Datapoint 2200]]\u2014fundamental aspects of the design came not from Intel but from CTC. In 1968, CTC's Vic Poor and Harry Pyle developed the original design for the [[instruction set]] and operation of the processor. In 1969, CTC contracted two companies, [[Intel]] and [[Texas Instruments]], to make a single-chip implementation, known as the CTC 1201.<ref name=\"forgotten-history\">{{cite web | url = http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9111341/Forgotten_PC_history_The_true_origins_of_the_personal_computer | title = Forgotten history: the true origins of the PC | first = Lamont | last = Wood |date=August 2008 | publisher = Computerworld | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5vZKtCs1r | archivedate = 2011-01-07 | accessdate = 2011-01-07 }}</ref> In late 1970 or early 1971, TI dropped out being unable to make a reliable part. In 1970, with Intel yet to deliver the part, CTC opted to use their own implementation in the Datapoint 2200, using traditional TTL logic instead (thus the first machine to run \"8008 code\" was not in fact a microprocessor at all and was delivered a year earlier). Intel's version of the 1201 microprocessor arrived in late 1971, but was too late, slow, and required a number of additional support chips. CTC had no interest in using it. CTC had originally contracted Intel for the chip, and would have owed them {{US$|50,000|1971}} for their design work.<ref name=\"forgotten-history\"/> To avoid paying for a chip they did not want (and could not use), CTC released Intel from their contract and allowed them free use of the design.<ref name=\"forgotten-history\"/> Intel marketed it as the 8008 in April, 1972, as the world's first 8-bit microprocessor. It was the basis for the famous \"[[Mark-8]]\" computer kit advertised in the magazine ''[[Radio-Electronics]]'' in 1974.  This processor had an 8-bit data bus and a 14-bit address bus.<ref>Intel 8008 data sheet.</ref>\n\nThe 8008 was the precursor to the successful [[Intel 8080]] (1974), which offered improved performance over the 8008 and required fewer support chips. Federico Faggin conceived and designed it using high voltage N channel MOS. The [[Zilog Z80]] (1976) was also a Faggin design, using low voltage N channel with depletion load and derivative Intel 8-bit processors: all designed with the methodology Faggin created for the 4004. [[Motorola]] released the competing [[Motorola 6800|6800]] in August 1974, and the similar [[MOS Technology 6502]] in 1975 (both designed largely by the same people). The 6502 family rivaled the Z80 in popularity during the 1980s.\n\nA low overall cost, small packaging, simple [[computer bus]] requirements, and sometimes the integration of extra circuitry (e.g. the Z80's built-in [[memory refresh]] circuitry) allowed the [[home computer]] \"revolution\" to accelerate sharply in the early 1980s. This delivered such inexpensive machines as the [[Sinclair ZX-81]], which sold for {{US$|99|1981}}. A variation of the 6502, the [[MOS Technology 6510]] was used in the [[Commodore 64]] and yet another variant, the 8502, powered the [[Commodore 128]].\n\n[[Western Design Center|The Western Design Center, Inc]] (WDC) introduced the CMOS [[65C02]] in 1982 and licensed the design to several firms. It was used as the CPU in the [[Apple IIe]] and [[Apple IIc|IIc]] personal computers as well as in medical implantable grade [[pacemaker]]s and [[defibrillator]]s, automotive, industrial and consumer devices. WDC pioneered the licensing of microprocessor designs, later followed by [[ARM Holdings|ARM]] (32-bit) and other microprocessor [[intellectual property]] (IP) providers in the 1990s.\n\nMotorola introduced the [[Motorola 6809|MC6809]] in 1978. It was an ambitious and well thought-through 8-bit design that was [[source compatible]] with the [[Motorola 6800|6800]], and implemented using purely [[Electrical wiring|hard-wired]] logic (subsequent 16-bit microprocessors typically used [[microcode]] to some extent, as CISC design requirements were becoming too complex for pure hard-wired logic).\n\nAnother early 8-bit microprocessor was the [[Signetics 2650]], which enjoyed a brief surge of interest due to its innovative and powerful [[instruction set]] architecture.\n\nA seminal microprocessor in the world of spaceflight was [[Radio Corporation of America|RCA]]'s [[RCA 1802]] (aka CDP1802, RCA COSMAC) (introduced in 1976), which was used on board the [[Galileo spacecraft|Galileo]] probe to Jupiter (launched 1989, arrived 1995). RCA COSMAC was the first to implement [[CMOS]] technology. The CDP1802 was used because it could be run at very [[low-power electronics|low power]], and because a variant was available fabricated using a special production process, [[silicon on sapphire]] (SOS), which provided much better protection against [[cosmic radiation]] and [[electrostatic discharge]] than that of any other processor of the era. Thus, the SOS version of the 1802 was said to be the first radiation-hardened microprocessor.\n\nThe RCA 1802 had what is called a [[static logic (digital logic)|static design]], meaning that the [[clock frequency]] could be made arbitrarily low, even to 0&nbsp;Hz, a total stop condition. This let the [[Galileo spacecraft]] use minimum electric power for long uneventful stretches of a voyage. Timers or sensors would awaken the processor in time for important tasks, such as navigation updates, attitude control, data acquisition, and radio communication. Current versions of the Western Design Center 65C02 and 65C816 have static cores, and thus retain data even when the clock is completely halted.\n\n===12-bit designs===\nThe [[Intersil 6100]] family consisted of a [[12-bit]] microprocessor (the 6100) and a range of peripheral support and memory ICs. The microprocessor recognised the DEC [[PDP-8]] [[minicomputer]] instruction set. As such it was sometimes referred to as the '''CMOS-PDP8'''. Since it was also produced by Harris Corporation, it was also known as the '''Harris HM-6100'''. By virtue of its CMOS technology and associated benefits, the 6100 was being incorporated into some military designs until the early 1980s.\n\n===16-bit designs===\nThe first multi-chip [[16-bit]] microprocessor was the [[National Semiconductor]] [[IMP-16]], introduced in early 1973. An 8-bit version of the chipset was introduced in 1974 as the IMP-8.\n\nOther early multi-chip 16-bit microprocessors include one that [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)]] used in the [[LSI-11]] OEM board set and the packaged [[PDP-11|PDP 11/03]] [[minicomputer]]\u2014and the [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] MicroFlame 9440, both introduced in 1975\u201376.  In 1975, National introduced the first 16-bit single-chip microprocessor, the [[National Semiconductor PACE]], which was later followed by an [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] version, the [[INS8900]].\n\nAnother early single-chip 16-bit microprocessor was TI's [[Texas Instruments TMS9900|TMS 9900]], which was also compatible with their [[TI-990]] line of minicomputers. The 9900 was used in the TI 990/4 minicomputer, the [[TI-99/4A]] home computer, and the TM990 line of OEM microcomputer boards. The chip was packaged in a large ceramic 64-pin [[Dual in-line package|DIP package]], while most 8-bit microprocessors such as the Intel 8080 used the more common, smaller, and less expensive plastic 40-pin DIP. A follow-on chip, the TMS 9980, was designed to compete with the Intel 8080, had the full TI 990 16-bit instruction set, used a plastic 40-pin package, moved data 8&nbsp;bits at a time, but could only address 16&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|KB]]. A third chip, the TMS 9995, was a new design. The family later expanded to include the 99105 and 99110.\n\nThe [[Western Design Center]] (WDC) introduced the CMOS [[WDC 65816/65802|65816]] 16-bit upgrade of the WDC CMOS [[WDC 65C02|65C02]] in 1984. The 65816 16-bit microprocessor was the core of the [[Apple IIgs]] and later the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], making it one of the most popular 16-bit designs of all time.\n\nIntel \"upsized\" their 8080 design into the 16-bit [[Intel 8086]], the first member of the [[x86]] family, which powers most modern [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] type computers. [[Intel]] introduced the 8086 as a cost-effective way of porting software from the 8080 lines, and succeeded in winning much business on that premise. The [[Intel 8088|8088]], a version of the 8086 that used an 8-bit external data bus, was the microprocessor in the first [[IBM PC]]. Intel then released the [[Intel 80186|80186]] and [[Intel 80188|80188]], the [[Intel 80286|80286]] and, in 1985, the 32-bit [[Intel 80386|80386]], cementing their PC market dominance with the processor family's backwards compatibility. The 80186 and 80188 were essentially versions of the 8086 and 8088, enhanced with some onboard peripherals and a few new instructions.  Although Intel's 80186 and 80188 were not used in IBM PC type designs, second source versions from NEC, the [[NEC V20|V20]] and V30 frequently were.  The 8086 and successors had an innovative but limited method of [[memory segmentation]], while the 80286 introduced a full-featured segmented [[memory management unit]] (MMU). The 80386 introduced a flat 32-bit memory model with paged memory management.\n\nThe 16-bit Intel x86 processors up to and including the 80386 do not include [[Floating-point unit|floating-point units (FPUs)]]. Intel introduced the [[Intel 8087|8087]], [[Intel 80187|80187]], [[Intel 80287|80287]] and [[Intel 80387|80387]] math coprocessors to add hardware floating-point and transcendental function capabilities to the 8086 through 80386 CPUs. The 8087 works with the 8086/8088 and 80186/80188,<ref>Intel 8087 datasheet, pg. 1</ref> the 80187 works with the 80186 but not the 80188,<ref>The 80187 only has a 16-bit data bus because it used the 80387SX core.</ref> the 80287 works with the 80286 and the 80387 works with the 80386.  The combination of an x86 CPU and an x87 coprocessor forms a single multi-chip microprocessor; the two chips are programmed as a unit using a single integrated instruction set.<ref>\"Essentially, the 80C187 can be treated as an additional resource or an extension to the CPU. The 80C186 CPU together with an 80C187 can be used as a single unified system.\" Intel 80C187 datasheet, p. 3, November 1992 (Order Number: 270640-004).</ref> The 8087 and 80187 coprocessors are connected in parallel with the data and address buses of their parent processor and directly execute instructions intended for them.  The 80287 and 80387 coprocessors are interfaced to the CPU through I/O ports in the CPU's address space, this is transparent to the program, which does not need to know about or access these I/O ports directly; the program accesses the coprocessor and its registers through normal instruction opcodes.\n\n===32-bit designs===\n[[File:80486DX2 200x.png|thumb|Upper interconnect layers on an [[Intel 80486]]DX2 die]]\n\n16-bit designs had only been on the market briefly when [[32-bit]] implementations started to appear.\n\nThe most significant of the 32-bit designs is the [[Motorola 68000|Motorola MC68000]], introduced in 1979.{{dubious|date=January 2015}} The 68k, as it was widely known, had 32-bit registers in its programming model but used 16-bit internal data paths, three 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Units, and a 16-bit external data bus (to reduce pin count), and externally supported only 24-bit addresses (internally it worked with full 32&nbsp;bit addresses). In [[PC-based IBM-compatible mainframes]] the MC68000 internal microcode was modified to emulate the 32-bit System/370 IBM mainframe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://priorartdatabase.com/IPCOM/000059679# |title=Priorartdatabase.com |publisher=Priorartdatabase.com |date=1986-01-01 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}</ref> Motorola generally described it as a 16-bit processor. The combination of high performance, large (16&nbsp;[[megabyte]]s or 2<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;bytes) memory space and fairly low cost made it the most popular CPU design of its class. The [[Apple Lisa]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] designs made use of the 68000, as did a host of other designs in the mid-1980s, including the [[Atari ST]] and [[Commodore Amiga]].\n\nThe world's first single-chip fully 32-bit microprocessor, with 32-bit data paths, 32-bit buses, and 32-bit addresses, was the [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] [[Bell Labs]] BELLMAC-32A, with first samples in 1980, and general production in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shoji, M.

These microprocessors were used in the AT&T 3B5 and 3B15 minicomputers; in the 3B2, the world's first desktop super microcomputer; in the \"Companion\", the world's first 32-bit [[laptop]] computer; and in \"Alexander\", the world's first book-sized super microcomputer, featuring ROM-pack memory cartridges similar to today's gaming consoles. All these systems ran the [[UNIX System V]] operating system.\n\nThe first commercial, single chip, fully 32-bit microprocessor available on the market was the [[HP FOCUS]].\n\nIntel's first 32-bit microprocessor was the [[Intel iAPX 432|iAPX 432]], which was introduced in 1981, but was not a commercial success. It had an advanced [[Capability-based security|capability-based]] [[Object (computer science)|object-oriented]] architecture, but poor performance compared to contemporary architectures such as Intel's own 80286 (introduced 1982), which was almost four times as fast on typical benchmark tests. However, the results for the iAPX432 was partly due to a rushed and therefore suboptimal [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] [[compiler]].{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nMotorola's success with the 68000 led to the [[Motorola 68010|MC68010]], which added virtual memory support. The [[Motorola 68020|MC68020]], introduced in 1984 added full 32-bit data and address buses. The 68020 became hugely popular in the [[Unix]] supermicrocomputer market, and many small companies (e.g., [[Altos Computer Systems|Altos]], [[UNOS (operating system)|Charles River Data Systems]], [[Cromemco]]) produced desktop-size systems. The [[Motorola 68030|MC68030]] was introduced next, improving upon the previous design by integrating the MMU into the chip. The continued success led to the [[Motorola 68040|MC68040]], which included an [[floating point unit|FPU]] for better math performance. A 68050 failed to achieve its performance goals and was not released, and the follow-up [[Motorola 68060|MC68060]] was released into a market saturated by much faster RISC designs. The 68k family faded from use in the early 1990s.\n\nOther large companies designed the 68020 and follow-ons into embedded equipment. At one point, there were more 68020s in embedded equipment than there were [[Intel]] Pentiums in PCs.<ref>{{cite web|title=MCore: Does Motorola Need Another Processor Family?|last=Turley|first=Jim|work=Embedded Systems Design|publisher=TechInsights (United Business Media)|url=http://www.embedded.com/98/9807sr.htm|date=July 1998|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980702003323/http://www.embedded.com/98/9807sr.htm |archivedate=1998-07-02|accessdate=2009-12-23}}</ref> The [[Motorola ColdFire|ColdFire]] processor cores are derivatives of the venerable 68020.\n\nDuring this time (early to mid-1980s), [[National Semiconductor]] introduced a very similar 16-bit pinout, 32-bit internal microprocessor called the NS 16032 (later renamed 32016), the full 32-bit version named the [[NS320xx|NS 32032]]. Later, National Semiconductor produced the [[NS320xx|NS 32132]], which allowed two CPUs to reside on the same memory bus with built in arbitration. The NS32016/32 outperformed the MC68000/10, but the NS32332\u2014which arrived at approximately the same time as the MC68020\u2014did not have enough performance. The third generation chip, the NS32532, was different. It had about double the performance of the MC68030, which was released around the same time. The appearance of RISC processors like the AM29000 and MC88000 (now both dead) influenced the architecture of the final core, the NS32764. Technically advanced\u2014with a superscalar RISC core, 64-bit bus, and internally overclocked\u2014it could still execute Series 32000 instructions through real-time translation.\n\nWhen National Semiconductor decided to leave the Unix market, the chip was redesigned into the Swordfish Embedded processor with a set of on chip peripherals. The chip turned out to be too expensive for the [[laser printer]] market and was killed. The design team went to Intel and there designed the Pentium processor, which is very similar to the NS32764 core internally. The big success of the Series 32000 was in the laser printer market, where the NS32CG16 with microcoded BitBlt instructions had very good price/performance and was adopted by large companies like Canon. By the mid-1980s, [[Sequent Computer Systems|Sequent]] introduced the first SMP server-class computer using the NS 32032. This was one of the design's few wins, and it disappeared in the late 1980s. The [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] [[R2000 (microprocessor)|R2000]] (1984) and [[R3000]] (1989) were highly successful 32-bit RISC microprocessors. They were used in high-end workstations and servers by [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]], among others. Other designs included the [[Zilog Z80000]], which arrived too late to market to stand a chance and disappeared quickly.\n\nThe [[ARM architecture|ARM]] first appeared in 1985.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| title = Speciation through entrepreneurial spin-off: The Acorn-ARM story\n| journal = Research Policy\n| date = March 2008\n| first = Elizabeth\n| last = Garnsey\n|author2= Lorenzoni, Gianni|author3= Ferriani, Simone\n| volume = 37\n| issue = 2\n| id = \n| url = http://www2.sa.unibo.it/~simone.ferriani/Download/Speciation%20through%20Entrepreneurial%20Spin-off.pdf\n| format = PDF\n| accessdate = 2011-06-02\n| quote = [...] the first silicon was run on April 26th 1985.\n| doi=10.1016/j.respol.2007.11.006}}\n</ref> This is a [[RISC]] processor design, which has since come to dominate the 32-bit [[embedded systems]] processor space due in large part to its power efficiency, its licensing model, and its wide selection of system development tools. Semiconductor manufacturers generally license cores and integrate them into their own [[system on a chip]] products; only a few such vendors are licensed to modify the ARM cores. Most [[cell phones]] include an ARM processor, as do a wide variety of other products. There are microcontroller-oriented ARM cores without virtual memory support, as well as [[symmetric multiprocessor system|symmetric multiprocessor]] (SMP) applications processors with virtual memory.\n\nFrom 1993 to 2003, the 32-bit [[x86]] architectures became increasingly dominant in [[desktop computer|desktop]], [[laptop]], and server markets, and these microprocessors became faster and more capable. Intel had licensed early versions of the architecture to other companies, but declined to license the Pentium, so [[AMD]] and [[Cyrix]] built later versions of the architecture based on their own designs. During this span, these processors increased in complexity (transistor count) and capability (instructions/second) by at least three orders of magnitude. Intel's Pentium line is probably the most famous and recognizable 32-bit processor model, at least with the public at broad.\n\n===64-bit designs in personal computers===\nWhile [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] microprocessor designs have been in use in several markets since the early 1990s (including the [[Nintendo 64]] [[gaming console]] in 1996), the early 2000s saw the introduction of 64-bit microprocessors targeted at the PC market.\n\nWith AMD's introduction of a 64-bit architecture backwards-compatible with x86, [[x86-64]] (also called '''AMD64'''), in September 2003, followed by Intel's near fully compatible 64-bit extensions (first called IA-32e or EM64T, later renamed '''Intel 64'''), the 64-bit desktop era began. Both versions can run 32-bit legacy applications without any performance penalty as well as new 64-bit software. With operating systems [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition|Windows XP x64]], [[Windows Vista]] x64, [[Windows 7]] x64, [[Linux]], [[BSD]], and [[Mac OS X]] that run 64-bit native, the software is also geared to fully utilize the capabilities of such processors. The move to 64&nbsp;bits is more than just an increase in register size from the IA-32 as it also doubles the number of general-purpose registers.\n\nThe move to 64&nbsp;bits by [[PowerPC]] had been intended since the architecture's design in the early 90s and was not a major cause of incompatibility. Existing integer registers are extended as are all related data pathways, but, as was the case with IA-32, both floating point and vector units had been operating at or above 64&nbsp;bits for several years. Unlike what happened when IA-32 was extended to x86-64, no new general purpose registers were added in 64-bit PowerPC, so any performance gained when using the 64-bit mode for applications making no use of the larger address space is minimal.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nIn 2011, ARM introduced a new 64-bit ARM architecture.\n\n===RISC===\n{{Main article|reduced instruction set computing}}\n\nIn the mid-1980s to early 1990s, a crop of new high-performance reduced instruction set computer ([[RISC]]) microprocessors appeared, influenced by discrete RISC-like CPU designs such as the [[IBM 801]] and others. RISC microprocessors were initially used in special-purpose machines and [[Unix]] [[workstation]]s, but then gained wide acceptance in other roles.\n\nThe first commercial RISC microprocessor design was released in 1984, by [[MIPS Computer Systems]], the 32-bit [[R2000 (microprocessor)|R2000]] (the R1000 was not released). In 1986, HP released its first system with a [[PA-RISC]] CPU<!-- NOT microprocessor -->. In 1987, in the non-Unix [[Acorn computers]]' 32-bit, then cache-less, [[ARM2]]-based [[Acorn Archimedes]] became the first commercial success using the [[ARM architecture]], then known as Acorn RISC Machine (ARM); first silicon [[ARM architecture|ARM1]] in 1985. The R3000 made the design truly practical, and the [[R4000]] introduced the world's first commercially available 64-bit RISC microprocessor. Competing projects would result in the IBM [[IBM POWER Instruction Set Architecture|POWER]] and [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[SPARC]] architectures. Soon every major vendor was releasing a RISC design, including the [[AT&T CRISP]], [[AMD 29000]], [[Intel i860]] and [[Intel i960]], [[Motorola 88000]], [[DEC Alpha]].\n\nIn the late 1990s, only two 64-bit RISC architectures were still produced in volume for non-embedded applications: [[SPARC]] and [[Power Architecture|Power ISA]], but as ARM has become increasingly powerful, in the early 2010s, it became the third RISC architecture in the general computing segment.\n\n===Multi-core designs===\n{{Main article|multi-core processor}}\n{{Refimprove|section and the sections below|date=March 2012}}\n\nA different approach to improving a computer's performance is to add extra processors, as in [[symmetric multiprocessing]] designs, which have been popular in servers and workstations since the early 1990s. Keeping up with [[Moore's Law]] is becoming increasingly challenging as chip-making technologies approach their physical limits. In response, microprocessor manufacturers look for other ways to improve performance so they can maintain the momentum of constant upgrades.\n\nA [[multi-core processor]] is a single chip that contains more than one microprocessor core. Each core can simultaneously execute processor instructions in parallel. This effectively multiplies the processor's potential performance by the number of cores, if the software is designed to take advantage of more than one processor core. Some components, such as bus interface and cache, may be shared between cores. Because the cores are physically close to each other, they can communicate with each other much faster than separate (off-chip) processors in a multiprocessor system, which improves overall system performance.\n\nIn 2001, [[IBM]] introduced the first commercial multi-core processor, the monolithic two-core [[POWER4]].  Personal computers did not receive multi-core processors until the 2003 introduction of the two-core [[Intel]] [[Pentium D]]. The Pentium D, however, was not a monolithic multi-core processor. It was constructed from two dies, each containing a core, packaged on a [[multi-chip module]]. The first monolithic multi-core processor in the personal computer market was the [[AMD]] [[Athlon X2]], which was introduced a few weeks after the Pentium D. {{As of|2012}}, dual- and quad-core processors are widely used in home PCs and laptops, while quad-, six-, eight-, ten-, twelve-, and sixteen-core processors are common in the professional and enterprise markets with workstations and servers.\n\nSun Microsystems has released the [[UltraSPARC T1|Niagara]] and [[UltraSPARC T2|Niagara 2]] chips, both of which feature an eight-core design. The Niagara 2 supports more [[thread (computing)|thread]]s and operates at 1.6&nbsp;GHz.\n\nHigh-end Intel Xeon processors that are on the [[LGA 775]], [[LGA 1366]], and [[LGA 2011]] sockets and high-end AMD Opteron processors that are on the [[Socket C32|C32]] and [[Socket G34|G34]] sockets are DP (dual processor) capable, as well as the older Intel Core 2 Extreme QX9775 also used in an older Mac Pro by Apple and the Intel Skulltrail motherboard. AMD's G34 motherboards can support up to four CPUs and Intel's [[LGA 1567]] motherboards can support up to eight CPUs.\n\nModern desktop computers support systems with multiple CPUs, but few applications outside of the professional market can make good use of more than four cores. Both Intel and AMD currently offer fast quad, hex and octa-core desktop CPUs, making multi-CPU systems obsolete for many purposes.\nThe desktop market has been in a transition towards quad-core CPUs since Intel's Core 2 Quad was released and are now common, although dual-core CPUs are still more prevalent. Older or mobile computers are less likely to have more than two cores than newer desktops.  Not all software is optimised for multi-core CPUs, making fewer, more powerful cores preferable.\n\nAMD offers CPUs with more cores for a given amount of money than similarly priced Intel CPUs\u2014but the AMD cores are somewhat slower, so the two trade blows in different applications depending on how well-threaded the programs running are. For example, Intel's cheapest Sandy Bridge quad-core CPUs often cost almost twice as much as AMD's cheapest Athlon II, Phenom II, and FX quad-core CPUs but Intel has dual-core CPUs in the same price ranges as AMD's cheaper quad-core CPUs. In an application that uses one or two threads, the Intel dual-core CPUs outperform AMD's similarly priced quad-core CPUs\u2014and if a program supports three or four threads the cheap AMD quad-core CPUs outperform the similarly priced Intel dual-core CPUs.\n\nHistorically, AMD and Intel have switched places as the company with the fastest CPU several times. Intel currently leads on the desktop side of the computer CPU market, with their Sandy Bridge and [[Ivy Bridge (microarchitecture)|Ivy Bridge]] series. In servers, AMD's new [[Opteron]]s seem to have superior performance for their price point. This means that AMD are currently more competitive in low- to mid-end servers and workstations that more effectively use fewer cores and threads.\n\nTaken to the extreme, this trend also includes [[manycore]] designs, with hundreds of cores, with qualitatively different architectures.\n\n==Market statistics==\nIn 1997, about 55% of all [[central processing unit|CPU]]s sold in the world are 8-bit [[microcontroller]]s, over two billion of which were sold.<ref>{{cite web | title=Microchip on the March | year=1998 | author=Cantrell, Tom | url=http://www.circuitcellar.com/library/designforum/silicon_update/3/ | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220134759/http://www.circuitcellar.com/library/designforum/silicon_update/3/index.asp | archivedate=2007-02-20 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, less than 10% of all the CPUs sold in the world were 32-bit or more.
