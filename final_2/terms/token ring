This [[token passing]] is a [[channel access method]] providing fair access for all stations, and eliminating the collisions of [[Contention (telecommunications)|contention]]-based access methods.\n\nIntroduced by IBM in 1984, it was then standardized with protocol '''IEEE 802.5''' and was fairly successful, particularly in corporate environments, but gradually eclipsed by the later versions of [[Ethernet]].\n\n(The main focus of this article is the IBM/IEEE 802.5 version, but there were several other earlier implementations of token rings).\n\n==History==\nA wide range of different [[local area network]] technologies were developed in the early 1970s, of which one, the [[Cambridge Ring (computer network)|Cambridge Ring]] had demonstrated the potential of a [[token passing]] ring [[network topology|topology]], and many teams worldwide began working on their own implementations. At the [[IBM Zurich Research Laboratory]] Werner Bux and Hans M\u00fcller in particular worked on the design and development of IBM's token ring technology,<ref>[http://www.zurich.ibm.com/news/03/ieee.html \"IEEE honors Zurich LAN pioneers\"], Zurich, Switzerland, 14 April 2003</ref> while early work at [[MIT]]<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/85/6828543/06828547.pdf?arnumber=6828547 \"Early Token Ring Work at MIT\"], J.

Token ring does not inherently support this feature and requires additional software and hardware to operate on a direct cable connection setup.<ref>{{cite web|author=Louis Ohland |url=http://ps-2.kev009.com/ohlandl/NIC/8228.html#DirectCable |title=8228 Multistation Access Unit |website=Ps-2.kev009.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-03}}</ref>\n* Token ring eliminates collision by the use of a single-use token and early token release to alleviate the down time. Ethernet alleviates collision by [[carrier sense multiple access]] and by the use of an intelligent [[Network switch|switch]]; primitive Ethernet devices like [[Ethernet hub|hubs]] can precipitate collisions due to repeating traffic blindly.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://duxcw.com/faq/network/hubsw.htm | title=What is the difference between an Ethernet hub and switch? | accessdate=10 May 2016}}</ref>\n* Token ring network interface cards contain all of the intelligence required for speed autodetection, routing and can drive themselves on many Multistation Access Units (MAUs) that operate without power (most MAUs operate in this fashion, only requiring a power supply for [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]]). Ethernet network interface cards can theoretically operate on a passive hub to a degree, but not as a large LAN and the issue of collisions is still present.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zen22142.zen.co.uk/Circuits/Interface/pethhub.htm |title=A Passive Ethernet Hub |website=Zen22142.zen.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-08-03}}</ref>\n* Token ring employs 'access priority' in which certain nodes can have priority over the token. Unswitched Ethernet does not have provisioning for an access priority system as all nodes have equal contest for traffic.\n* Multiple '''identical''' [[MAC address]]es are supported on token ring (a feature used by [[S/390]] mainframes).<ref name=\"redbooks.ibm.com\"/> Switched Ethernet cannot support duplicate MAC addresses without reprimand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://serverfault.com/questions/462178/duplicate-mac-address-on-the-same-lan-possible |title=networking - Duplicate MAC address on the same LAN possible? |publisher=Server Fault |date=2013-01-03 |accessdate=2016-08-03}}</ref>\n* Token Ring was more complex than Ethernet, requiring a specialized processor and licensed MAC/LLC firmware for each interface. By contrast, Ethernet included both the (simpler) firmware and the lower licensing cost in the MAC chip. The cost of a token ring interface using the Texas Instruments TMS380C16 MAC and PHY was approximately three times that of an Ethernet interface using the Intel 82586 MAC and PHY.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n* Initially both networks used expensive cable, but once Ethernet was standardized for unshielded [[Ethernet over twisted pair|twisted pair]] with [[10BASE-T]] ([[Category 3 cable|Cat 3]]) and [[100BASE-TX]] ([[Category 5 cable|Cat 5(e)]]), it had a distinct advantage and sales of it increased markedly.\n* Even more significant when comparing overall system costs was the much-higher cost of router ports and network cards for token-ring vs Ethernet. The emergence of Ethernet switches may have been the final straw.\n\n==Operation==\nStations on a token ring LAN are [[Logical topology|logically organized]] in a [[ring network|ring topology]] with data being transmitted sequentially from one ring station to the next with a control token circulating around the ring controlling access. Similar [[token passing]] mechanisms are used by [[ARCNET]], [[token bus]], [[100BaseVG|100VG-AnyLAN]] (802.12) and [[FDDI]], and they have theoretical advantages over the [[CSMA/CD]] of early [[Ethernet]].<ref>[http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/classics-rock/does-anyone-actually-still-use-token-ring/ \"Does anyone actually still USE Token Ring?\"], John Sheesley, April 2, 2008, TechRepublic</ref>\n\nA token ring network can be modeled as a [[polling system]] where a single server provides service to queues in a cyclic order.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bux | first1 = W. | title = Token-ring local-area networks and their performance | doi = 10.1109/5.18625 | journal = [[Proceedings of the IEEE]]| volume = 77 | issue = 2 | page = 238 | year = 1989 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref>\n\n===Access control===\nThe data transmission process goes as follows:\n\n* Empty information frames are continuously circulated on the ring.  \n* When a computer has a message to send, it seizes the token. The computer will then be able to send the frame.  \n* The frame is then examined by each successive workstation. The workstation that identifies itself to be the destination for the message copies it from the frame and changes the token back to 0.  \n* When the frame gets back to the originator, it sees that the token has been changed to 0 and that the message has been copied and received. It removes the message from the frame.  \n* The frame continues to circulate as an \"empty\" frame, ready to be taken by a workstation when it has a message to send.\n\n===Multistation Access Units and Controlled Access Units===\n{{main | Media Access Unit}}\n[[image:IBM 8228 Multistation Access Unit.JPG|thumb|The IBM 8228 Multistation Access Unit with accompanying Setup Aid to prime the relays on each port]]\nPhysically, a token ring network is wired as a [[star network|star]], with 'MAUs' in the center, 'arms' out to each station, and the loop going out-and-back through each.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=ftp://ps-2.kev009.com/incoming/timc/PDFS/IBM/Networking/IBM_C_TR.pdf |format=PDF |title=Whu buy from IBM? |website=Ps-2.kev009.com |accessdate=2016-08-03}}</ref>\n\nA MAU could present in the form of a hub or a switch; since token ring had no collisions many MAUs were manufactured as hubs.

This was the basic cable for the \"IBM Cabling System\", a [[structured cabling]] system that IBM hoped would be widely adopted. Unique [[hermaphroditic connector]]s, commonly referred to as '''IBM Data Connectors''' in formal writing or colloquially as '''[[Boy George]] connectors''' were used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottsnetworkclass.com/Ether_Token/Token_3.html |title=Local Area Networks - Token Ring |publisher=Scottsnetworkclass.com |accessdate=2013-06-15}}</ref> The connectors have the disadvantage of being quite bulky, requiring at least 3 x 3&nbsp;cm panel space, and being relatively fragile. The advantages of the connectors being that they are genderless and have superior shielding over standard unshielded RJ45. Connectors at the computer were usually [[D-subminiature|DE-9]] female.\n\nIn later implementations of Token Ring, Cat 6 cabling was also supported, so RJ45 connectors were used on both of the MAUs, CAUs and NICs; with many of the network cards supporting both RJ45 and DE-9 for backwards compatibility.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n<gallery>\n8228 ring in.JPG|IBM Data Connectors on the IBM 8228 Multistation Access Unit.\nToken ring media filters.JPG|RJ45 'Media Filters' that plug into an IBM Data Connector converting it for use with RJ45 connectors.\n</gallery>\n\n===Frame types===\n\n====Token====\nWhen no station is sending a frame, a special token frame circles the loop.

There can be only one active monitor on a ring at a time. The active monitor is chosen through an election or ''monitor contention'' process.\n\nThe monitor contention process is initiated when the following happens:\n* a loss of signal on the ring is detected.\n* an active monitor station is not detected by other stations on the ring.\n* a particular timer on an end station expires such as the case when a station hasn't seen a token frame in the past 7 seconds.\n\nWhen any of the above conditions take place and a station decides that a new monitor is needed, it  will transmit a \"claim token\" frame, announcing that it wants to become the new monitor. If that token returns to the sender,  it is OK for it to become the monitor. If some other station tries to become the monitor at the same time then the station with the highest [[MAC address]] will win the election process. Every other station becomes a standby monitor. All stations must be capable of becoming an active monitor station if necessary.\n\nThe active monitor performs a number of ring administration functions. The first function is to operate as the master clock for the ring in order to provide synchronization of the signal for stations on the wire. Another function of the AM is to insert a 24-bit delay into the ring, to ensure that there is always sufficient buffering in the ring for the token to circulate. A third function for the AM is to ensure that exactly one token circulates whenever there is no frame being transmitted, and to detect a broken ring. Lastly, the AM is responsible for removing circulating frames from the ring.\n\n===Token ring insertion process===\nToken ring stations must go through a 5-phase ring insertion process before being allowed to participate in the ring network. If any of these phases fail, the token ring station will not ''insert'' into the ring and the token ring driver may report an error.\n\n* Phase 0 (Lobe Check) \u2014 A station first performs a lobe media check. A station is ''wrapped'' at the MSAU and is able to send 2000 test frames down its transmit pair which will loop back to its receive pair. The station checks to ensure it can receive these frames without error.\n* Phase 1 (Physical Insertion) \u2014 A station then sends a 5 volt signal to the MSAU to open the relay.\n* Phase 2 (Address Verification) \u2014 A station then transmits MAC frames with its own MAC address in the destination address field of a token ring frame. When the frame returns and if the Address Recognized (AR) and Frame Copied (FC) bits in the frame-status are set to 0 (indicating that no other station currently on the ring uses that address), the station must participate in the periodic (every 7 seconds) ring poll process. This is where stations identify themselves on the network as part of the MAC management functions.\n* Phase 3 (Participation in ring poll) \u2014 A station learns the address of its Nearest Active Upstream Neighbour (NAUN) and makes its address known to its nearest downstream neighbour, leading to the creation of the ring map. Station waits until it receives an AMP or SMP frame with the AR and FC bits set to 0. When it does, the station flips both bits (AR and FC) to 1, if enough resources are available, and queues an SMP frame for transmission. If no such frames are received within 18 seconds, then the station reports a failure to open and de-inserts from the ring. If the station successfully participates in a ring poll, it proceeds into the final phase of insertion, request initialization.\n* Phase 4 (Request Initialization) \u2014 Finally a station sends out a special request to a parameter server to obtain configuration information. This frame is sent to a special functional address, typically a token ring bridge, which may hold timer and ring number information the new station needs to know.\n\n===Optional priority scheme===\nIn some applications there is an advantage to being able to designate one station having a higher priority. Token ring specifies an optional scheme of this sort, as does the [[Controller Area Network|CAN Bus]], (widely used in automotive applications) - but Ethernet does not.\n\nIn the Token ring priority MAC, 8 priority levels, 0\u20137, are used. When the station wishing to transmit receives a token or data frame with a priority less than or equal to the station's requested priority, it sets the priority bits to its desired priority. The station does not immediately transmit; the token circulates around the medium until it returns to the station. Upon sending and receiving its own data frame, the station downgrades the token priority back to the original priority.\n\nHere are the following 8 access priority and traffic types for devices that support [[802.1Q]] and [[802.1p]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
