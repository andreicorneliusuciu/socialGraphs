The change in position within the orbit is usually defined as the phase angle, \u03d5,and is the change in true anomaly required between the spacecraft\u2019s current position to the final position.<br />\n \nThe phase angle can be converted in terms of time using Kepler\u2019s Equation:<ref>Curtis, Howard D (2014).

To gain or lose this time, the spacecraft must be subjected to a simple two-impulse Hohmann transfer which takes the spacecraft away from, and then back to, its original orbit. The first impulse to change the spacecraft\u2019s orbit is performed at a specific point in the original orbit (point of impulse, POI), usually performed in the original orbit\u2019s [[periapsis]] or [[apoapsis]]. The impulse creates a new orbit called the \u201cphasing orbit\u201d and is larger or smaller than the original orbit resulting in a different period time than the original orbit. The difference in period time between the original and phasing orbits will be equal to the time converted from the phase angle. Once one period of the phasing orbit is complete, the spacecraft will return to the POI and the spacecraft will once again be subjected to a second impulse, equal and opposite to the first impulse, to return it to the original orbit. When complete, the spacecraft will be in the targeted final position within the original obit.\n\nTo find some of the phasing orbital parameters, first one must find the required period time of the phasing orbit using the following equation.\n\n:<math>T_2=T_1-t</math>\nwhere\n:''T<sub>1</sub>'' is defined as period of original orbit\n:''T<sub>2</sub>'' is defined as period of phasing orbit\n:''t'' is defined as time elapsed to cover phase angle in original orbit\n\nOnce phasing orbit period is determined, the phasing orbit [[semimajor axis]] can be derived from the period formula:<ref>Francis, Hale J (1994).

A second change in velocity equal to the magnitude but opposite in direction of the first must be done after the spacecraft travels one phase orbit period to return the spacecraft from the phasing orbit to the original orbit. Total change of velocity required for the phasing maneuver is equal to two times ''\u2206V''.\n\nOrbit phasing can also be referenced as co-orbital rendezvous <ref>Sellers, Jerry Jon (2005).

Here, two spacecraft on the same orbit but at different true anomalies rendezvous by either one or both of the spacecrafts entering phasing orbits which cause them to return to their original orbit at the same true anomaly at the same time.\n\nPhasing maneuvers are also commonly employed by geosynchronous satellites, either to conduct station-keeping maneuvers to maintain their orbit above a specific latitude, or to change latitude altogether.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n*[[Orbital maneuver]]\n*[[Docking maneuver]]\n*[[Hohmann transfer orbit]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n; General\n*{{cite book | author= Curtis, Howard D | title = [[Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students]] (Third Edition)\n|publisher= Butterworth-Heinemann | date = 2014 | isbn = 978-0-08-097747-8}}\n*{{cite book | author= Francis, Hale J | title = Introduction To Space Flight\n|publisher= Prentice-Hall, Inc. | date = 1994 | isbn = 0-13-481912-8}}\n* {{cite book | author=Sellers, Jerry Jon | author2=Marion, Jerry B. | title=Understanding Space An Introduction to Astronautics (Third Edition) | publisher=McGraw-Hill | date=2005 | isbn=978-0-07-340775-3}}\n* http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/2.6921 Minimum-Time Orbital Phasing Maneuvers - AIAA, CD Hall - 2003 \n* [http://ccar.colorado.edu/asen5050/projects/projects_2012/bartkowicz/website/orbital_mechanics_4.html Phasing Maneuver]\n{{Orbits}}\n\n[[Category:Astrodynamics]]"}]}}}}
