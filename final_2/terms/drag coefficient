It is used in the [[drag equation]] in which a lower drag coefficient indicates the object will have less [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] or [[Hydrodynamics|hydrodynamic]] drag. The drag coefficient is always associated with a particular surface area.<ref>McCormick, Barnes W.

For automobiles and many other objects, the reference area is the projected frontal area of the vehicle. This may not necessarily be the cross sectional area of the vehicle, depending on where the cross section is taken. For example, for a sphere <math>A = \\pi r^2\\,</math> (note this is not the surface area = <math>\\!\\ 4 \\pi r^2</math>).\n\nFor [[airfoil]]s, the reference area is the nominal wing area. Since this tends to be large compared to the frontal area, the resulting drag coefficients tend to be low, much lower than for a car with the same drag, frontal area, and speed.\n\n[[Airship]]s and some [[Solid of revolution|bodies of revolution]] use the volumetric drag coefficient, in which the reference area is the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the [[cube root]] of the airship volume (volume to the two-thirds power). Submerged streamlined bodies use the wetted surface area.\n\nTwo objects having the same reference area moving at the same speed through a fluid will experience a drag force proportional to their respective drag coefficients. Coefficients for unstreamlined objects can be 1 or more, for streamlined objects much less.\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Cd flat plate.svg|thumb|right|200px|Flow around a plate, showing stagnation.]]\n{{Main|Drag equation}}\n\nThe drag equation\n\n:<math>F_d\\, =\\, \\tfrac12\\, \\rho\\, u^2\\, c_d\\, A</math>\n\nis essentially a statement that the [[Drag (physics)|drag]] [[force]] on any object is proportional to the density of the fluid and proportional to the square of the relative [[flow speed]] between the object and the fluid.\n\n''C<sub>d</sub>'' is not a constant but varies as a function of flow speed, flow direction, object position, object size, fluid density and fluid [[viscosity]]. Speed, [[kinematic viscosity]] and a characteristic [[length scale]] of the object are incorporated into a dimensionless quantity called the [[Reynolds number]] <math>\\scriptstyle Re</math>. <math>\\scriptstyle C_\\mathrm d\\,</math> is thus a function of <math>\\scriptstyle Re</math>. In a compressible flow, the speed of sound is relevant, and <math>\\scriptstyle C_\\mathrm d\\,</math> is also a function of [[Mach number]] <math>\\scriptstyle Ma</math>.\n\nFor certain body shapes, the drag coefficient <math>\\scriptstyle C_\\mathrm d\\,</math> only depends on the Reynolds number <math>\\scriptstyle Re\\,</math>, Mach number <math>\\scriptstyle Ma\\,</math> and the direction of the flow. For low Mach number <math>\\scriptstyle Ma</math>, the drag coefficient is independent of Mach number. Also, the variation with Reynolds number <math>\\scriptstyle Re\\,</math> within a practical range of interest is usually small, while for cars at highway speed and aircraft at cruising speed, the incoming flow direction is also more-or-less the same. Therefore, the drag coefficient <math>\\scriptstyle C_\\mathrm d\\,</math> can often be treated as a constant.<ref>Clancy, L. J.: ''Aerodynamics''. Sections 4.15 and 5.4</ref>\n\nFor a streamlined body to achieve a low drag coefficient, the [[boundary layer]] around the body must remain attached to the surface of the body for as long as possible, causing the [[wake]] to be narrow. A high ''form drag'' results in a broad wake. The boundary layer will transition from laminar to turbulent if Reynolds number of the flow around the body is sufficiently great. Larger velocities, larger objects, and lower [[viscosity|viscosities]] contribute to larger Reynolds numbers.<ref name=Clancy_4.17>Clancy, L. J.: ''Aerodynamics''. Section 4.17</ref>\n\n[[File:Drag coefficient on a sphere vs. Reynolds number - main trends.svg|thumb|Drag coefficient ''C''<sub>d</sub> for a sphere as a function of [[Reynolds number]] ''Re'', as obtained from laboratory experiments. The dark line is for a sphere with a smooth surface, while the lighter line is for the case of a rough surface.

At very low Reynolds numbers, without flow separation, the drag force <math>\\scriptstyle F_\\mathrm d\\,</math> is proportional to <math>\\scriptstyle v\\,</math> instead of <math>\\scriptstyle v^2\\,</math>; for a sphere this is known as [[Stokes' law|Stokes law]]. The Reynolds number will be low for small objects, low velocities, and high viscosity fluids.<ref name=Clancy_4.17/>\n\nA <math>\\scriptstyle C_\\mathrm d\\,</math> equal to 1 would be obtained in a case where all of the fluid approaching the object is brought to rest, building up [[stagnation pressure]] over the whole front surface. The top figure shows a flat plate with the fluid coming from the right and stopping at the plate. The graph to the left of it shows equal pressure across the surface. In a real flat plate, the fluid must turn around the sides, and full stagnation pressure is found only at the center, dropping off toward the edges as in the lower figure and graph. Only considering the front side, the <math>\\scriptstyle C_\\mathrm d\\,</math> of a real flat plate would be less than 1; except that there will be suction on the back side: a negative pressure (relative to ambient). The overall <math>\\scriptstyle C_\\mathrm d\\,</math> of a real square flat plate perpendicular to the flow is often given as 1.17.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Flow patterns and therefore <math>\\scriptstyle C_\\mathrm d\\,</math> for some shapes can change with the Reynolds number and the roughness of the surfaces.\n<!-- and there should be examples of other simple shapes -->\n\n==Drag coefficient ''c''<sub>d</sub> examples==\n\n===General===\nIn general, <math>c_\\mathrm d\\,</math> is not an absolute constant for a given body shape.

The aerodynamic forces on a body come primarily from differences in pressure and viscous shearing stresses. Thereby, the drag force on a body could be divided into two components, namely frictional drag (viscous drag) and pressure drag (form drag). The net drag force could be decomposed as follows:\n[[File:Aerodynamics of Airfoil.jpg|thumb|Flow across an airfoil showing the relative impact of drag force to the direction of motion of fluid over the body. This drag force gets divided into frictional drag and pressure drag. The same airfoil is considered as a streamlined body if friction drag (viscous drag) dominates pressure drag and is considered a blunt body when pressure drag (form drag) dominates friction drag.]]\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nc_\\mathrm d &= \\dfrac{2 F_\\mathrm d}{\\rho v^2 A}\\ \\\\\n&= c_\\mathrm p + c_\\mathrm f \\\\\n&= \\underbrace{ \\dfrac{1}{\\rho v^2 A}\\ \\displaystyle \\int\\limits_{S} \\mathrm{d}A \\, (p-p_o) \\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\sdot \\hat{\\mathbf{i}}\\right) }_{ c_\\mathrm p }+ \\underbrace{ \\dfrac{1}{\\rho v^2 A}\\ \\displaystyle \\int\\limits_{S} \\mathrm{d}A \\, \\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{t}} \\sdot \\hat{\\mathbf{i}}\\right) T_w }_{ c_\\mathrm f} \n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere:\n:<math>c_\\mathrm p\\,</math> is the [[pressure]] drag coefficient, \n:<math>c_\\mathrm f\\,</math> is the [[friction]] drag coefficient,\n:<math>\\hat \\mathbf{t} </math> = Tangential direction to the surface with area dA,\n:<math>\\hat \\mathbf{n} </math> = Normal direction to the surface with area dA,\n:<math>T_\\mathrm w\\,</math> is the [[shear Stress]] acting on the surface dA,\n:<math>p_\\mathrm o\\,</math> is the pressure far away from the surface dA,\n:<math>p\\,</math> is pressure at surface dA,\n:<math>\\hat{\\mathbf{i}}</math> is the unit vector in direction normal to the surface dA, forming a unit vector <math>\\mathrm{d}\\hat A</math>\n\nTherefore, when the drag is dominated by a frictional component, the body is called a streamlined body; whereas in the case of dominant pressure drag, the body is called a '''''blunt body'''''. Thus, the shape of the body and the angle of attack determine the type of drag. For example, an airfoil is considered as a body with a small angle of attack by the fluid flowing across it. This means that it has attached [[boundary layer]]s, which produce much less pressure drag.\n[[File:Pressure Drag and Friction Drag.png|thumb|right|Trade-off relationship between pressure drag and friction drag]]\nThe [[wake]] produced is very small and drag is dominated by the friction component. Therefore, such a body (here an airfoil) is described as streamlined, whereas for bodies with fluid flow at high angles of attack, boundary layer separation takes place. This mainly occurs due to adverse [[pressure gradient]]s at the top and rear parts of an [[airfoil]].\n\nDue to this, wake formation takes place, which consequently leads to eddy formation and pressure loss due to pressure drag. In such situations, the airfoil is [[Stall (flight)|stalled]] and has higher pressure drag than friction drag. In this case, the body is described as a blunt body.\n\nA streamlined body looks like a fish ([[Tuna]], [[Oropesa (minesweeping)|Oropesa]], etc.) or an airfoil with small angle of attack, whereas a blunt body looks like a brick, a cylinder or an airfoil with high angle of attack. For a given frontal area and velocity, a streamlined body will have lower resistance than a blunt body. Cylinders and spheres are taken as blunt bodies because the drag is dominated by the pressure component in the wake region at high [[Reynolds number]].\n\nTo reduce this drag, either the flow separation could be reduced or the surface area in contact with the fluid could be reduced (to reduce friction drag). This reduction is necessary in devices like cars, bicycle, etc. to avoid vibration and noise production.\n\n====Practical example====\nThe [[Automotive aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] design of cars has evolved from the 1920s to the end of the 20th century. This change in design from a blunt body to a more streamlined body reduced the drag coefficient from about 0.95 to 0.30.\n\n[[File:Aerodynamic Drag of Car.jpg|centre|Time history of aerodynamic drag of cars in comparison with change in geometry of streamlined bodies (blunt to streamline).]]\n\n<center>''Time history of cars' [[aerodynamic drag]] in comparison to change in geometry of streamlined bodies (blunt to streamline).''</center>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Automotive aerodynamics]]\n* [[Automobile drag coefficient]]\n* [[Ballistic coefficient]]\n* [[Drag crisis]]\n* [[Zero-lift drag coefficient]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Clancy, L.
