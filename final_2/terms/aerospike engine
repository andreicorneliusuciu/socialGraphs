It belongs to the class of [[altitude compensating nozzle]] engines. A vehicle with an aerospike engine uses 25\u201330% less fuel at low altitudes, where most missions have the greatest need for [[thrust]]. Aerospike engines have been studied for a number of years and are the baseline engines for many [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) designs and were also a strong contender for the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]]. However, no such engine is in commercial production, although some large-scale aerospikes are in testing phases.<ref>[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/x-33/aerospik.htm Aerospike Engine Homepage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe terminology in the literature surrounding this subject is somewhat confused\u2014the term ''aerospike'' was originally used for a truncated [[plug nozzle]] with a very rough conical taper and some gas injection, forming an \"air spike\" to help make up for the absence of the plug tail. However, frequently, a full-length plug nozzle is now called an aerospike.\n\n==Principles==\nThe purpose of any engine bell is to direct the exhaust of a rocket engine in one direction, generating thrust in the opposite direction. The exhaust, a high-temperature mix of gases, has an effectively random momentum distribution (i.e., the exhaust pushes in any direction it can).  If the exhaust is allowed to escape in this form, only a small part of the flow will be moving in the correct direction and thus contribute to forward thrust.  The bell redirects exhaust moving in the wrong direction so that it generates thrust in the correct direction.  Ambient air pressure also imparts a small pressure against the exhaust, helping to keep it moving in the \"right\" direction as it exits the engine.  As the vehicle travels through the atmosphere, ambient air pressure is reduced.  This causes the thrust-generating exhaust to begin to expand outside the edge of the bell.  Since this exhaust begins traveling in the \"wrong\" direction (i.e., outward from the main exhaust plume), the efficiency of the engine is reduced as the rocket travels because this escaping exhaust is no longer contributing to the thrust of the engine.  An aerospike rocket engine seeks to eliminate this loss of efficiency.\n\n[[File:Aerospikeprinciplediagram.svg|thumb|Comparison between the design of a bell-nozzle rocket (left) and an aerospike rocket (right)]]\n\nInstead of firing the exhaust out of a small hole in the middle of a bell, an aerospike engine avoids this random distribution by firing along the outside edge of a wedge-shaped protrusion, the \"spike\", which serves the same function as a traditional engine bell. The spike forms one side of a \"virtual\" bell, with the other side being formed by the outside air\u2014thus the \"aerospike\".\n\nThe idea behind the aerospike design is that at low altitude the ambient pressure compresses the exhaust against the spike. Exhaust recirculation in the base zone of the spike can raise the pressure in that zone to nearly ambient. Since the pressure in front of the vehicle is ambient, this means that the exhaust at the base of the spike nearly balances out with the drag experienced by the vehicle.  It gives no overall thrust, but this part of the nozzle also doesn't ''lose'' thrust by forming a partial vacuum.  The thrust at the base part of the nozzle can be ignored at low altitude.\n\nAs the vehicle climbs to higher altitudes, the air pressure holding the exhaust against the spike decreases, as does the drag in front of the vehicle. The recirculation zone at the base of the spike maintains the pressure in that zone to a fraction of 1 [[bar (unit)|bar]], higher than the near-vacuum in front of the vehicle, thus giving extra thrust as altitude increases.  This effectively behaves like an \"altitude compensator\" in that the size of the bell automatically compensates as air pressure falls.\n\nThe disadvantages of aerospikes seem to be extra weight for the spike, and increased cooling requirements due to the extra heated area. Furthermore, the larger cooled area can reduce performance below theoretical levels by reducing the pressure against the nozzle. Aerospikes work relatively poorly between [[Mach number|Mach]] 1-3, where the airflow around the vehicle has reduced the pressure, thus reducing the thrust.<ref name=\"nozzledesign\">[http://www.pwrengineering.com/articles/nozzledesign.htm PWR Nozzle Design]</ref>\n\n===Variations===\nSeveral versions of the design exist, differentiated by their shapes. In the '''toroidal aerospike''' the spike is bowl-shaped with the exhaust exiting in a ring around the outer rim. In theory this requires an infinitely long spike for best efficiency, but by blowing a small amount of gas out of the center of a shorter truncated spike, something similar can be achieved.\n\nIn the '''linear aerospike''' the spike consists of a tapered wedge-shaped plate, with exhaust exiting on either side at the \"thick\" end. This design has the advantage of being stackable, allowing several smaller engines to be placed in a row to make one larger engine while augmenting steering performance with the use of individual engine throttle control.\n\n==Performance==\n[[File:Annular-Aerospike.jpg|thumb|Rocketdyne's J-2T-250k annular aerospike test firing.]][[Rocketdyne]] conducted a lengthy series of tests in the 1960s on various designs. Later models of these engines were based on their highly reliable [[J-2 (rocket engine)|J-2]] engine machinery and provided the same sort of thrust levels as the conventional engines they were based on; 200,000 [[pound-force|lbf]] (890 [[Newton (unit)|kN]]) in the '''J-2T-200k''', and 250,000&nbsp;lbf (1.1 MN) in the '''J-2T-250k''' (the T refers to the toroidal combustion chamber). Thirty years later their work was dusted off again for use in [[NASA]]'s [[X-33]] project. In this case the slightly upgraded J-2S engine machinery was used with a linear spike, creating the '''XRS-2200'''. After more development and considerable testing, this project was cancelled when the X-33's composite fuel tanks repeatedly failed.\n \n[[File:Aerospike close-up.jpg|thumb|[[CSULB]] aerospike engine]]\nThree XRS-2200 engines were built during the X-33 program and underwent testing at NASA's [[John C. Stennis Space Center|Stennis Space Center]]. The single-engine tests were a success, but the program was halted before the testing for the 2-engine setup could be completed. The XRS-2200 produces {{convert|204420|lbf|abbr=on}} thrust with an [[Specific impulse|I<sub>sp</sub>]] of 339 seconds at sea level, and {{convert|266230|lbf|abbr=on}} thrust with an I<sub>sp</sub> of 436.5 seconds in a vacuum.\n\nThe RS-2200 Linear Aerospike Engine<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/engines/rs2200.htm Encyclopedia Astronautica - RS-2200 Linear Aerospike Engine]</ref> was derived from the XRS-2200. The RS-2200 was to power the [[VentureStar]] [[single-stage-to-orbit]] vehicle. In the latest design, seven RS-2200s producing {{convert|542000|lbf|kN}} each would boost the VentureStar into low earth orbit. The development on the RS-2200 was formally halted in early 2001 when the [[X-33]] program did not receive [[Space Launch Initiative]] funding. [[Lockheed Martin]] chose to not continue the VentureStar program without any funding support from NASA. An engine of this type is on outdoor display on the grounds of the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville Alabama.\n\n[[File:Non-truncated toroidal aerospike nozzle.jpg|thumb|NASA's Toroidal aerospike nozzle]]\nThe [[Lockheed Martin X-33#NASA cancellation|cancellation of the Lockheed Martin X-33 by the federal government in 2001]] decreased funding availability, but Aerospike Engines remain an area of active research. For example, a milestone was achieved when a joint academic/industry team from [[California State University, Long Beach]] (CSULB) and [[Garvey Spacecraft Corporation]] successfully conducted a flight test of a liquid-propellant powered aerospike engine in the [[Mojave Desert]] on September 20, 2003. CSULB students had developed their Prospector 2 (P-2) rocket using a 1,000&nbsp;lb<sub>f</sub> (4.4&nbsp;kN) LOX/ethanol aerospike engine. This work on aerospike engines continues; Prospector-10, a ten-chamber aerospike engine, was test-fired June 25, 2008.<ref>[http://www.csulb.edu/colleges/coe/mae/views/projects/rocket/ CSULB CALVEIN Rocket News and Events] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615154007/http://www.csulb.edu/colleges/coe/mae/views/projects/rocket/ |date=June 15, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nFurther progress came in March 2004 when two successful tests were carried out at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Centre using small-scale rockets manufactured by [[Blacksky Corporation]], based in [[Carlsbad, California]]. The aerospike nozzles and solid rocket motors were developed and built by the rocket motor division of [[Cesaroni Technology Incorporated]], north of Toronto, Ontario. The two rockets were solid-fuel powered and fitted with non-truncated toroidal aerospike nozzles. They reached apogees of {{convert|26000|ft|m|abbr=on}} and speeds of about [[Mach number|Mach]] 1.5.\n\nSmall-scale aerospike engine development using a [[hybrid rocket]] propellant configuration has been ongoing by members of the [[Reaction Research Society]].\n\n== Implementations ==\n\nIn July 2014 [[Firefly Space Systems]] announced its planned Alpha launcher that uses an aerospike engine for its first stage. Intended for the small satellite launch market, it is designed to launch satellites into low-Earth orbit (LEO) at a price of US$8\u20139 million, much lower than with conventional launchers.<ref name=giz1407>{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/firefly-alpha-aerospike-launch-vehicle/32892 |title=Firefly Space Systems unveils Alpha launch vehicle design with aerospike engine |publisher=Gizmag.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-14}}</ref>\n\nFirefly Alpha is designed to carry payloads of up to {{convert|400|kg}}. It uses carbon composite materials and uses the same basic design for both stages. The plug-cluster aerospike engine puts out {{convert|90000|lbf|kN}} of thrust. The engine has a bell-shaped nozzle that has been cut in half, then stretched to form a ring with the half-nozzle now forming the profile of a plug.<ref name=giz1407/>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Expanding nozzle]]\n* [[LASRE]]\n* [[Rotary Rocket]]\n* [[Lockheed Martin X-33]]\n* [[SABRE (rocket engine)|Sabre]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Aerospike rocket engines}}\n*[http://www.aerospaceweb.org/design/aerospike/main.shtml Aerospike Engine]\n*[http://www.astronautix.com/stages/satt250k.htm Advanced Engines planned for uprated Saturn and Nova boosters] \u2014 includes the J-2T\n*[http://www1.msfc.nasa.gov/NEWSROOM/background/facts/aerospike.html Linear Aerospike Engine \u2014 Propulsion for the X-33 Vehicle]\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/X-Press/stories/2004/063004/res_spike.html Dryden Flight Research Centre]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071007072409/http://www.pwrengineering.com/dataresources/AerospikeEngineControlSystemFeaturesAndPerformance.pdf Aerospike Engine Control System Features And Performance]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071009152233/http://www.pwrengineering.com/dataresources/X-33AttitudeControlUsingTheXRS-2200LinearAerospikeEngine.pdf X-33 Attitude Control Using The XRS-2200 Linear Aerospike Engine]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aerospike Engine}}\n[[Category:Rocket propulsion]]\n[[Category:Rocket engines]]\n[[Category:Industrial design]]"}]}}}}
