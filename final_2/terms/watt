The unit is defined as 1 [[joule]] per [[second]]<ref>{{SIBrochure8th|pages=118, 144}}</ref> and can be used to express the rate of [[Energy transformation|energy conversion]] or transfer with respect to time.

The measurement unit was recognized by the Second Congress of the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1882, concurrent with the start of commercial power production from both [[Hydroelectricity|water]] and [[Thermal power plant|steam]]. In 1960 the 11th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] adopted it for the measurement of power into the [[International System of Units]] (SI).\n<!--{{SI unit lowercase|James Watt|watt|W}}-->\n\n==Multiples==\n:''For additional examples of magnitude for multiples and submultiples of the watt, see [[Orders of magnitude (power)]]''\n{|class=infobox\n|-\n|{{SI multiples\n|unit=watt\n|symbol=W\n|note=Common multiples are in '''bold''' face\n|m=|k=|mc=|M=|n=|G=|p=|T=\n}}\n|}\n\n===Femtowatt===\nThe femtowatt is equal to one quadrillionth (10<sup>\u221215</sup>) of a watt. Technologically important powers that are measured in femtowatts are typically found in reference(s) to [[radio]] and [[radar]] receivers. For example, meaningful FM tuner performance figures for sensitivity, quieting and signal-to-noise require that the RF energy applied to the antenna input be specified. These input levels are often stated in dBf ([[decibel]]s referenced to 1 femtowatt). This is 0.2739 microvolt across a 75-ohm load or 0.5477 microvolt across a 300-ohm load; the specification takes into account the RF input impedance of the tuner.\n\n===Picowatt===\nThe picowatt is equal to one trillionth (10<sup>\u221212</sup>) of a watt. Technologically important powers that are measured in picowatts are typically used in reference to radio and radar receivers, acoustics and in the science of [[radio astronomy]].\n\n===Nanowatt===\nThe nanowatt is equal to one billionth (10<sup>\u22129</sup>) of a watt. Important powers that are measured in nanowatts are also typically used in reference to radio and radar receivers.\n\n===Microwatt===\nThe microwatt is equal to one millionth (10<sup>\u22126</sup>) of a watt. Important powers that are measured in microwatts are typically stated in [[medical instrument]]ation systems such as the [[EEG]] and the [[Electrocardiography|ECG]], in a wide variety of scientific and engineering instruments and also in reference to radio and radar receivers. Compact [[solar cells]] for devices such as calculators and watches are typically measured in microwatts.<ref>{{Citation | newspaper = The New York Times | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/18/business/18novel.html | title = Bye-Bye Batteries: Radio Waves as a Low-Power Source | date = Jul 18, 2010}}.</ref>\n\n===Milliwatt===\nThe milliwatt is equal to one thousandth (10<sup>\u22123</sup>) of a watt.

A small electric heater with one heating element can use 1.0 kilowatt. The average electric power consumption of a household in the United States is about one kilowatt.<ref group = notes>Average household electric power consumption is 1.19&nbsp;kW in the US, 0.53&nbsp;kW in the UK.

Many events or machines produce or sustain the conversion of energy on this scale, including large electric motors; large [[warship]]s such as [[aircraft carrier]]s, [[cruiser]]s, and [[submarine]]s; large [[server farm]]s or [[Data center#Energy use|data centers]]; and some scientific research equipment, such as [[supercollider]]s, and the output pulses of very large lasers. A large residential or commercial building may use several megawatts in electric power and heat.\nOn railways, modern high-powered [[electric locomotives]] typically have a peak power output of 5 or 6&nbsp;MW, although some produce much more. The [[British Rail Class 373|Eurostar]], for example, uses more than 12&nbsp;MW, while heavy [[diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] [[locomotive]]s typically produce/use 3 to 5&nbsp;MW. U.S. [[nuclear power plant]]s have net summer capacities between about 500 and 1300&nbsp;MW.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1350/v19/sr1350v19.pdf |publisher= [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] |year=2007 |title=2007\u20132008 Information Digest, Appendix A\n|accessdate= 27 January 2008 | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]]}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest citing of the megawatt in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) is a reference in the 1900 [[Webster's Dictionary|''Webster's International Dictionary of English Language'']]. The OED also states that megawatt appeared in a 28 November 1947 article in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' (506:2).\n\n===Gigawatt===\nThe gigawatt is equal to one billion (10<sup>9</sup>) watts or 1 gigawatt = 1000 megawatts.

The total power used by humans worldwide is commonly measured in terawatts (see [[World energy consumption#Primary energy|primary energy]]). The most powerful [[laser]]s from the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s produced power in terawatts, but only for [[nanosecond]] time frames. The average [[lightning]] strike peaks at 1 terawatt, but these strikes only last for 30 [[microsecond]]s.\n\n===Petawatt===\nThe petawatt is equal to one quadrillion ({{10^|15}}) watts and can be produced by the current generation of lasers for time-scales on the order of picoseconds ({{10^|-12}}&nbsp;s). One such laser is the Lawrence Livermore's [[Nova (laser)|Nova laser]], which achieved a power output of 1.25&nbsp;PW ({{val|1.25e15}}&nbsp;W) by a process called [[chirped pulse amplification]].  The duration of the pulse was roughly 0.5&nbsp;[[picosecond|ps]] ({{val|5e-13}}&nbsp;s), giving a total energy of 600&nbsp;J, or enough energy to power a 100&nbsp;W light bulb for six seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.llnl.gov/str/Petawatt.html |title = Crossing the Petawatt threshold |publisher = Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |location = [[Livermore, California|Livermore]], [[California|CA]] |accessdate = 19 June 2012}}</ref>  Another example is the Laser for Fast Ignition Experiments (LFEX) at the Institute of Laser Engineering (ILE), [[Osaka University]], which achieved a power output of 2&nbsp;PW ({{val|2e15}}&nbsp;W) for a duration of approximately 1&nbsp;[[picosecond|ps]].<ref>{{citation | title = World\u2019s most powerful laser: 2\u202f000 trillion watts.

Other [[SI prefix]]es are sometimes used, for example ''gigawatt electrical'' ('''GW<sub>e</sub>'''). The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]], which maintains the SI-standard, states that further information about a quantity should not be attached to the unit symbol but instead to the quantity symbol (i.e., ''P''<sub>thermal</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;270&nbsp;W rather than ''P''&nbsp;=&nbsp;270&nbsp;W<sub>th</sub>) and regards these symbols as incorrect and thus non-SI.<ref>{{SIBrochure8th|page= 138}}</ref>\n\nFor example, the [[Embalse nuclear power plant]] in Argentina uses a [[fission reactor]] to generate 2109&nbsp;MW<sub>t</sub> (i.e. heat), which creates steam to drive a turbine, which generates 648&nbsp;MW<sub>e</sub> (i.e. electricity).\n\n==Radio transmission==\n{{main|Effective radiated power}}\n[[Radio stations]] usually report the power of their transmitters in units of watts, referring to the [[effective radiated power]].  It refers to the relative power of the transmission when it is directed towards the horizon for maximum geographic coverage, rather than uniformly broadcast in all directions.\n\n==Confusion of watts, watt-hours and watts per hour==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2016}}\nThe terms [[Power (physics)|power]] and [[energy]] are frequently confused. Power is the rate at which energy is generated or consumed and hence is measured in units (e.g. watts) that represent energy ''per unit time''.\n\nFor example, when a light bulb with a power rating of {{gaps|100|W}} is turned on for one hour, the energy used is 100&nbsp;[[watt hour]]s (W&middot;h), 0.1&nbsp;kilowatt hour, or 360 [[joule#Kilojoule|kJ]]. This same amount of energy would light a 40-watt bulb for 2.5&nbsp;hours, or a 50-watt bulb for 2&nbsp;hours. A power station would be ''rated'' in multiples of watts (for example, the [[Three Gorges Dam]] is rated at approximately 22 gigawatts), but its annual energy ''sales'' or ''output'' would be in multiples of watt ''hours''. Major energy production or consumption is often expressed as [[terawatt hour]]s for a given period that is often a calendar year or financial year. One terawatt hour is equal to a sustained power of approximately 114 megawatts for a period of one year.\n\nThe [[watt second]] is a unit of energy, equal to the [[joule]].  One kilowatt hour is 3 600 000 watt seconds. The watt second is used, for example, to rate the energy storage of [[Flash (photography)|flash lamps]] used in photography, although the term ''joule'' is generally employed.\n\nTerms such as ''watts per hour'' (W/h) are often misused when ''watts'' would be correct.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.windsun.com/Inverters/Inverter_selection.htm |title=Inverter Selection |publisher=Northern Arizona Wind and Sun |accessdate=27 March 2009}}</ref> Watts per hour properly refers to a ''change'' of power per hour. Watts per hour might be useful to characterize the ramp-up behavior of [[power plant]]s. For example, a power plant that changes its power output from 0&nbsp;MW to 1&nbsp;MW in 15 minutes has a ramp-up rate of 4&nbsp;MW/h. [[Hydroelectricity|Hydroelectric]] power plants have a very high ramp-up rate, which makes them particularly useful in peak load and emergency situations.  The [[misnomer]] watts per hour is  essentially the [[derivative]] of [[Power (physics)|power]] and should be called rate of watt change per hour.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=24em}}\n*[[Conversion of units]]\n*[[Declared net capacity]] (power plants)\n*[[Metre\u2013tonne\u2013second system of units]] \n*[[Orders of magnitude (power)]]\n*[[Power factor]]\n*[[Root mean square]] (RMS)\n*[[Volt-ampere]]\n*[[Watt balance]]\n*[[Watt-peak]]\n*[[Wattmeter]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist |group= notes}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist |33em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* {{Citation | last = Borvon | first = G\u00e9rard | url = http://seaus.free.fr/spip.php?article964 | title = History of the electrical units | publisher = Free | place = [[France|FR]]}}.\n* {{Citation | last = Nelson | first = Robert A | url = http://www.aticourses.com/international_system_units.htm | title = The International System of Units: Its History and Use in Science and Industry | series = Via Satellite | date = February 2000 | publisher = ATI courses}}.\n\n{{SI units}}\n{{Portal bar|Energy}}\n\n[[Category:SI derived units]]\n[[Category:Units of power]]\n[[Category:James Watt]]"}]}}}}
