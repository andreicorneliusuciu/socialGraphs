[[Electrical Experimenter|Science and Invention]]'' magazine cover, November 1928]]\n\nAn '''invention''' is a unique or [[novelty (patent)|novel]] [[machine|device]], method, composition or process. The invention process is a process within an overall [[engineering]] and product development process.  It may be an improvement upon a machine or product, or a new process for creating an object or a result.  An invention that achieves a completely unique function or result may be a radical breakthrough.  Such works are novel and [[inventive step and non-obviousness|not obvious]] to [[person having ordinary skill in the art|others skilled in the same field]]. An inventor may be taking a big step in success or failure.\n\nSome inventions can be patented.  A [[patent]] legally protects the intellectual property rights of the inventor and legally recognizes that a claimed invention is actually an invention.  The rules and requirements for patenting an invention vary from country to country, and the process of obtaining a patent is often expensive.\n\nAnother meaning of invention is '''[[cultural invention]]''', which is an [[innovative]] set of useful [[social behaviour]]s adopted by people and passed on to others.<ref>Artificial Mythologies: A Guide to Cultural Invention by Craig J. Saper (1997); Review of Artificial Mythologies. A Guide to cultural Invention, Kirsten Ostherr (1998)</ref> The [[Institute for Social Inventions]] collected many such ideas in magazines and books.<ref>Nicholas Albery, Matthew Mezey, Mary McHugh and Marie Papworth (editors). \"Best Ideas: A Compendium of Social Inventions\". The Institute for Social Inventions, London, 1995.</ref>\nInvention is also an important component of artistic and design [[creativity]]. Inventions often extend the boundaries of human knowledge, experience or capability.\n\n== The Process of Invention ==\n=== Practical means of invention ===\n[[File:Alessandro Volta.jpeg|thumb|200px|[[Alessandro Volta]] with the first [[electrical battery]]. Volta is recognized as one of the most influential inventors of all time.]]\n\nThe idea for an invention may be developed on paper or on a computer, by writing or drawing, by [[trial and error]], by making models, by [[experiment]]ing, by testing and/or by making the invention in its whole form. [[Brainstorming]] also can spark new ideas for an invention.  Collaborative creative processes are frequently used by engineers, designers, architects and scientists. Co-inventors are frequently named on patents.\n\nIn addition, many inventors keep [[inventor's notebook|records]] of their working process - [[inventor's notebook|notebooks]], photos, etc., including [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Evangelista Torricelli]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Albert Einstein]].<ref>''The Inventor's Notebook'' by Fred Grissom and David Pressman (2005)</ref><ref>''Leonardo da Vinci: Artist, Scientist, Inventor'' by Simona Cremante (2005)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/jefferson_papers/ |title=Jefferson's Papers at the Library of Congress |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-07-17}}</ref><ref>[http://www.alberteinstein.info/about/Information about Albert Einstein]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the process of developing an invention, the initial idea may change. The invention may become simpler, more practical, it may expand, or it may even ''morph'' into something totally different. Working on one invention can lead to others too.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/0200_201_08.htm |title=Continuation Patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Offices |publisher=Uspto.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-07-17}}</ref>\n\nHistory shows that turning the concept of an invention into a working device is not always swift or direct.  Inventions may also become more useful after time passes and other changes occur.  For example, the [[parachute]] became more useful once powered [[flight]] was a reality.<ref>White, Lynn: The Invention of the Parachute, ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 9, Nremante (2005)</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Conceptual means ===\n[[Image:Edison and phonograph edit2.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Thomas Edison]] with [[phonograph]]. Edison is considered one of the most prolific inventors in history, holding [[List of Edison patents|1,093 U.S. patents in his name]].]]\n\nInvention is often a [[creative process]]. An open and curious mind allows an inventor to see beyond what is known. Seeing a new possibility, connection, or relationship can spark an invention. Inventive thinking frequently involves combining concepts or elements from different realms that would not normally be put together. Sometimes inventors disregard the boundaries between distinctly separate territories or fields.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}  Several concepts may be considered when thinking about invention.\n\n==== Play ====\nPlay may lead to invention. Childhood curiosity, experimentation, and imagination can develop one's play instinct\u2014an inner need according to [[Carl Jung]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} Inventors feel the need to play with things that interest them, and to explore, and this internal drive brings about novel creations.<ref name=\"inventionatplay1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.inventionatplay.org/inventors_main.html |title=Lemelson Centers Invention at Play : Inventors Stories |publisher=Inventionatplay.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref><ref>Juice: The Creative Fuel That Drives World-Class Inventors (2004), p.14-15 by Evan I. Schwartz.</ref>\n\nSometimes inventions and ideas may seem to arise spontaneously while [[daydreaming]], especially when the mind is free from its usual concerns.<ref>Claxton, Guy. \"Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind: Why intelligence increases when you think less\". Fourth Estate, London, 1997.</ref> For example, both J. K. Rowling (the creator of [[Harry Potter]])<ref>Smith, Sean. \"J. K. Rowling: A Biography.\" Michael O'Mara Books Limited, 2001.</ref> and Frank Hornby (the inventor of [[Meccano]])<ref>Jack, Ian. \"Before the Oil Ran Out: Britain 1977-87\". Martin Secker & Warburg Ltd, 1987.</ref> first had their ideas while on [[train]] journeys.\n\n==== Re-envision ====\nTo invent is to see anew.  Inventors often envision a new idea, seeing it in their [[mind's eye]]. New ideas can arise when the conscious mind turns away from the subject or problem, when the inventor's focus is on something else, or while relaxing or sleeping. A novel idea may come in a flash\u2014a [[Eureka effect|Eureka]]! moment. For example, after years of working to figure out the general theory of relativity, the solution came to Einstein suddenly in a dream \"like a giant die making an indelible impress, a huge map of the universe outlined itself in one clear vision\".<ref>Einstein: A Life by Denis Brian p.159 (1996)</ref> Inventions can also be accidental, such as in the case of [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (Teflon).\n\n==== Insight ====\nInsight can also be a vital element of invention. Such inventive insight may begin with questions, doubt or a [[Intuition (knowledge)|hunch]]. It may begin by recognizing that something unusual or accidental may be useful or that it could open a new avenue for exploration. For example, the odd metallic color of plastic made by accidentally adding a thousand times too much catalyst led scientists to explore its metal-like properties, inventing electrically conductive plastic and light emitting plastic-\u2014an invention that won the Nobel Prize in 2000 and has led to innovative lighting, display screens, wallpaper and much more (see [[conductive polymer]], and [[organic light-emitting diode]] or [[OLED]]).<ref>Nobelprize.org, [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/public.html ''The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2000''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019144626/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/public.html |date=October 19, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==== Exploration ====\n[[File:Photographing Sound in 1884. A rare photograph taken at Volta Laboratory by J. Harris Rogers, a friend of Bell and Tainter (Smithsonian photo 44312-E) i009.jpg|thumb|300px|A rare 1884 photo showing the experimental recording of voice patterns by a photographic process at the [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory]] in Washington, D.C.  Many of their experimental designs panned out in failure.]]\n\nInvention is often an exploratory process with an uncertain or unknown outcome. There are failures as well as successes. Inspiration can start the process, but no matter how complete the initial idea, inventions typically must be developed.\n\n==== Improvement ====\nInventors may, for example, try to improve something by making it more effective, healthier, faster, more efficient, easier to use, serve more purposes, longer-lasting, cheaper, more [[ecological]]ly friendly, or [[aesthetic]]ally different, lighter weight, more [[ergonomic]], structurally different, with new light or color properties, etc.\n\n=== Implementing Inventions ===\n[[Image:Arabic Numerals.svg|thumb|left|400px|Western [[Arabic numerals]] - an example of non-material inventions.]]\n[[Image:ZST Bratislava Petrzalka 3.jpg|thumb|Railways&nbsp;\u2014 probably the most important invention in [[land transport]]. (Railway station in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]])]]\nIn [[economic theory]], inventions are one of the chief examples of \"[[externality|positive externalities]]\", a beneficial side-effect that falls on those outside a transaction or activity.  One of the central concepts of economics is that externalities should be internalized\u2014unless some of the benefits of this positive externality can be captured by the parties, the parties are under-rewarded for their inventions, and systematic under-rewarding leads to under-investment in activities that lead to inventions.  The [[patent]] system captures those [[externality|positive externalities]] for the inventor or other patent owner, so that the economy as a whole invests an optimum amount of resources in the invention process.\n\n== Invention vs. innovation ==\n{{Main|Innovation}}\nIn the social sciences, an innovation is something that is new, better, and has been adopted.  The theory for adoption of an innovation, called ''[[diffusion of innovations]]'', considers the likelihood that an innovation is adopted and the taxonomy of persons likely to adopt it or spur its adoption. This theory was first put forth by [[Everett Rogers]].<ref>Diffusion of Innovations, 5th Edition by Everett Rogers (2003)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ciadvertising.org/studies/student/98_fall/theory/hornor/paper1.html |title=ciadvertising.org |publisher=ciadvertising.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref> [[Gabriel Tarde]] also dealt with the adoption of innovations in his ''Laws of Imitation''.<ref>Les lois de l'imitation Gabriel Tarde (1890)</ref>\n\n== Purposes of invention ==\nAn invention can serve many purposes. These purposes might differ significantly and may change over time.  An invention, or a further-developed version of it, may serve purposes never envisioned by its original inventor(s) or by others living at the time of its original invention.  As an example, consider all the kinds of plastic developed, their many uses, and the significant growth this material invention is still undergoing.<ref name=\"inventionatplay1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.invention.smithsonian.org/home/ |title=Explore invention at the Lemelson Center :: Smithsonian Lemelson Center |publisher=Invention.smithsonian.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Talk of the Nation |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4244179 |title=Exploring the Process of Inventing |publisher=NPR |date=2004-12-24 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref><ref>[http://www.greenfieldpatents.com/inventitiveprocess.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105054635/http://www.greenfieldpatents.com/inventitiveprocess.php |date=January 5, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov |title=United States Patent and Trademark Office |publisher=Uspto.gov |date=1994-12-01 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/main/glossary/index.html#cip |title=Glossary |publisher=Uspto.gov |date=2004-08-22 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref><ref>http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1985/2/1985_2_18.shtml</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.packagingtoday.com/introplasticexplosion.htm |title=at Directnic |publisher=Packagingtoday.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ides.com/plastics/A.htm |title=Plastic Materials (Aar - ACN) |publisher=Ides.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpf.co.uk/bpfindustry/process_plastics.cfm |title=Plastipedia: The Plastics Encyclopedia - Plastics Processes |publisher=Bpf.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plastiquarian.com/ |title=The Plastics Historical Society - Home |publisher=Plastiquarian.com|date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref><ref>[http://www.plasticsindustry.org/industry/history.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914121330/http://www.plasticsindustry.org/industry/history.htm |date=September 14, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Invention as defined by patent law ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}\n{{see also|Patentability}}\n[[Image:US Patent cover.jpg|thumb|upright|[[United States patent law|U.S. patent]]]]\nThe term ''invention'' is also an important legal concept and central to patent law systems worldwide. As is often the case for legal concepts, its legal meaning is slightly different from common usage of the word.  Additionally, the ''legal'' concept of invention is quite different in American and European patent law.\n\nIn Europe, the first test a patent application must pass is, \"Is this an invention?\" If it is, subsequent questions are whether it is new, and sufficiently inventive. The implication\u2014counter intuitively\u2014is that a legal invention is not inherently novel. Whether a patent application relates to an invention is governed by Article 52 of the European Patent Convention, that excludes, e.g., discoveries ''as such'' and software ''as such''. The EPO Boards of Appeal decided that the technical character of an application is decisive for it to represent an invention, following an age-old Italians and German tradition. British courts don't agree with this interpretation. Following a 1959 Australian decision (\"NRDC\"), they believe that it is not possible to grasp the invention concept in a single rule. A British court once stated that the technical character test implies a \"...restatement of the problem in more imprecise terminology.\"\n\nIn the United States, all patent applications are considered inventions. The statute explicitly says that the American invention concept includes discoveries (35 USC \u00a7 100(a)), contrary to the European invention concept. The European invention concept corresponds to the American \"patentable subject matter\" concept: the first test a patent application is submitted to. While the statute (35 USC \u00a7 101) virtually poses no limits to patenting whatsoever, courts have decided in binding precedents that abstract ideas, natural phenomena and laws of nature are not patentable. Various attempts were made to substantiate the \"abstract idea\" test, which suffers from abstractness itself, but eventually none of them was successful. The last attempt so far was the \"machine or transformation\" test, but the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 2010 that it is merely an indication at best.\n\n== Invention in the arts ==\nInvention has a long and important history in [[the arts]].  Inventive thinking has always played a vital role in the [[creative process]].<ref>''Creating Minds: An Anatomy of Creativity Seen Through the Lives of Freud, Einstein, Picasso, Stravinsky, Eliot, Graham, and Gandhi'' by Howard Gardner (1993)</ref>  While some inventions in the arts are [[patentable]], others are not because they cannot fulfill the strict requirements governments have established for granting them.  (see [[patent]]).\n\nSome inventions in art include the:\n\n* [[Collage]] and construction invented by Picasso\n* [[Readymade]] invented by [[Marcel Duchamp]]\n* [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobile]] invented by [[Alexander Calder]]\n* Combine invented by [[Robert Rauschenberg]]\n* Shaped painting invented by [[Frank Stella]]\n* Motion picture, the invention of which is attributed to [[Eadweard Muybridge]]<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Eadweard_Muybridge.aspx#1E1-Muybridg Encyclopedia.com and Muybridge]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/399928/Eadweard-Muybridge |title=Eadweard Muybridge (British photographer) - Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=1904-05-08 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}</ref>\n\nLikewise, [[Jackson Pollock]] invented an entirely new form of painting and a new kind of abstraction by dripping, pouring, splashing and splattering paint onto un-stretched canvas lying on the floor.\n\nInventive tools of the artist's trade also produced advances in creativity.  [[Impressionist]] painting became possible because of newly invented collapsible, resealable metal paint tubes that facilitated spontaneous painting outdoors.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}  Inventions originally created in the form of artwork can also develop other uses, i.e., Alexander Calder's mobile, which is now commonly used over babies' cribs.  Funds generated from patents on inventions in art, design and architecture can support the realization of the invention or other creative work.  [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi]]'s 1879 [[design patent]] on the [[Statue of Liberty]] helped fund the famous statue because it covered small replicas, including those sold as souvenirs.<ref>1879, F.
