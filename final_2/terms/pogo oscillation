The name is a metaphor comparing the [[longitudinal wave|longitudinal]] vibration to the bouncing of a [[pogo stick]]. Pogo oscillation places stress on the frame of the vehicle which, in severe cases is dangerous.<ref name=\"Vibrationdata\" /> <!-- The following says absolutely nothing about severity or potential danger: <ref name=nasa-perils-pogo>{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-350/ch-3-5.html |title=The Perils of Pogo, Ch. 3.5 |work=Apollo Expeditions to the Moon |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 17, 2014}}</ref> -->\n\n== Origin ==\n\nIn general, pogo oscillation occurs when a surge in engine [[pressure]] increases [[back pressure]] against the [[fuel]] coming into the engine, reducing engine pressure, causing more fuel to come in and increasing engine pressure again.  Flexing of fuel pipes can also induce fluctuations in fuel pressure.<ref name=prince-lvdesign>{{cite web |format=PDF-3.0 Mb |author=Robert Stengel |publisher=Princeton University |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~stengel/MAE342Lecture4.pdf |title=Launch Vehicle Design: Configurations and Structures  |accessdate=June 18, 2009}}</ref> If the cycle happens to match a [[Resonance|resonance frequency]] of the rocket then dangerous [[oscillation]]s can occur through [[positive feedback]], which can, in extreme cases, tear the vehicle apart.\n\nAnother situation in which pogo oscillation will occur is when the engine is moving [[longitudinal axis|longitudinally]] with  fluctuating speed. Owing to [[inertia]], if the speed of the vehicle suddenly increases, the fuel inside the fuel tank tends to 'fall behind' and is forced into the [[turbopump]], a situation somewhat similar to the [[Slosh dynamics|slosh]] of liquid inside a tanker. This creates excess [[pressure]] to the turbopump and causes unintended excessive fuel to be delivered. This in turn creates excessive thrust and causes the vehicle to accelerate which leads to further increase in turbopump pressure and an unintended increase in fuel delivery. This can set up a [[vicious circle]], and can result in structural failure in the vehicle.<ref name=threshold-pogo>{{cite journal|first=Jim |last=Fenwick |date=Spring 1992 |title=Pogo |url=http://www.engineeringatboeing.com/articles/pogo.htm |publisher=Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne |journal=Threshold |accessdate=September 11, 2009 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113180241/http://www.engineeringatboeing.com/articles/pogo.htm |archivedate=January 13, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe most famous pogo oscillation was in the [[Saturn V]] first stage, [[S-IC]], caused by the cruciform thrust structure.  This structure was an \"X\" of two I-beams, with an engine on the end of each beam and the center engine at the intersection of the beams.  The center of the cruciform was unsupported, so the central [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1]] engine caused the structure to bend upwards.  The pogo oscillation occurred when this structure sprang back, lengthening the center engine's fuel line bellows (which was mounted down the center of the cruciform), temporarily reducing the fuel flow and thus reducing thrust.  At the other end of the oscillation, the fuel line was compressed, increasing fuel flow. This caused a sinusoidal thrust oscillation during the first stage ascent.\n\n== Hazard ==\n\nIf the oscillation is left unchecked, failures can result.  One case occurred in the middle [[J-2 (rocket engine)|J-2]] engine of the second stage, [[S-II]], of the [[Apollo 13]] lunar mission in 1970.  In this case, the engine shut down before the oscillations could cause damage to the vehicle.<ref name=\"Vibrationdata\"></ref>  Later events in this mission overshadowed the pogo problem. Pogo also had been experienced in the [[S-IC]] first stage of the unmanned [[Apollo 6]] test flight in 1968.<ref name=nasa-pogo-hsv>{{cite web |author=Curtis E.

The launch vehicle reached initial engine cutoff, but exploded 107 seconds after liftoff and disintegrated.<ref name=\"German\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bernd-leitenberger.de/hercules.shtml |title=Die russische Mondrakete N-1 (The Russian moon rocket N-1)  |website=www.bernd-leitenberger.de |language=German |accessdate=June 17, 2014}}</ref> There are other cases during unmanned launches in the 50s and 60s where the pogo effect caused catastrophic launch failures.\n\nHowever, modern vibration analysis methods can account for the pogo oscillation to ensure that it is far away from the vehicle's resonant frequencies.  Suppression methods include damping mechanisms or bellows in propellant lines.  The [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]]s each had a damper in the [[LOX]] line,<ref name=threshold-pogo/> but not in the [[hydrogen]] fuel line.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Slosh dynamics]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://yarchive.net/space/rocket/pogo.html Sci.space.shuttle newsgroup discussions of pogo]\n*[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1977NASSP8123....../0000001.000.html NASA Technical Paper on Flexible Propellant Lines Including Pogo Suppressors]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pogo Oscillation}}\n[[Category:Spacecraft propulsion]]\n\n[[ja:\u30ed\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3#Pogo\u632f\u52d5]]"}]}}}}
