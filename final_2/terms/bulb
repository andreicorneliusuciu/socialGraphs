(In [[gardening]], plants with other kinds of storage organ are also called \"[[ornamental bulbous plant]]s\" or just \"bulbs\".)\n\nA bulb's leaf bases, also known as scales, generally do not support leaves, but contain food reserves to enable the plant to survive adverse weather conditions. At the center of the bulb is a vegetative growing point or an unexpanded flowering shoot. The base is formed by a [[Plant stem|stem]], and plant growth occurs from this basal plate. [[Root]]s emerge from the underside of the base, and new stems and leaves from the upper side. '''Tunicate''' bulbs have dry, membranous outer scales that protect the continuous lamina of fleshy scales.<ref name=\"Mishra\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giqdNdoJNQsC |first=S.R. |last=Mishra |title=Plant Reproduction |publisher=Discovery Publishing House |year=2005 |isbn=978-81-7141-955-5 |pages=120\u2013125}}</ref> Species in the genera ''[[Allium]]'', ''[[Hippeastrum]]'', ''[[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]'', and ''[[Tulip]]a'' all have tunicate bulbs.

The technical term for plants that form underground storage organs, including bulbs as well as tubers and corms, is '''[[geophyte]]'''. Some [[Epiphyte|epiphytic]] [[orchid]]s (family [[Orchidaceae]]) form above-ground storage organs called '''[[pseudobulb]]s''', that superficially resemble bulbs.\n\nNearly all plants that form true bulbs are [[monocotyledon]]s, and include:\n*''[[Amaryllis]]'', ''[[Crinum]]'', ''[[Hippeastrum]]'', ''[[Narcissus (genus)|Narcissus]]'', and several other members of the amaryllis family [[Amaryllidaceae]].

Certain environmental conditions are needed to trigger the transition from one stage to the next, such as the shift from a cold winter to spring.<ref name=\"Mishra\"/> Once the flowering period is over, the plant enters a foliage period of about six weeks during which time the plant absorbs nutrients from the soil and energy from the sun for setting flowers for the next year. Bulbs dug up before the foliage period is completed will not bloom the following year but then should flower normally in subsequent years.\n\nAfter the foliage period is completed, bulbs may be dug up for replanting elsewhere. Any surface moisture should be dried, then the bulbs may be stored up to about 4 months for a fall planting. Storing them much longer than that may cause the bulbs to dry out inside and become nonviable.\n\n== Bulbil ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Lilium]] -->\nA '''bulbil''' is a small bulb, and may also be called a '''bulblet''', '''bulbet''', or '''bulbel'''.<ref name=Bell>{{cite book |author=Bell, A.D. |year=1997  |title=Plant form: an illustrated guide to flowering plant morphology |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, U.K.  }}</ref>\n\nSmall bulbs can develop or propagate a large bulb. If one or several moderate-sized bulbs form to replace the original bulb, they are called '''renewal bulbs'''.<ref name=Bell/> '''Increase bulbs''' are small bulbs that develop either on each of the leaves inside a bulb, or else on the end of small underground stems connected to the original bulb.<ref name=Bell/>\n\nSome lilies, such as the tiger lily ''[[Lilium lancifolium]]'', form small bulbs, called bulbils, in their leaf [[axil]]s. Several members of the onion family, Alliaceae, including ''Allium sativum'' ([[garlic]]), form bulbils in their flower heads, sometimes as the flowers fade, or even instead of the flowers. The so-called [[tree onion]] (''Allium \u00d7 proliferum'') forms small onions which are large enough for [[pickling]].\n\nSome ferns, such as [[Asplenium bulbiferum|Hen and Chicken Fern]] produce new plants at the tips of the fronds' pinnae, which are sometimes referred to as bulbils.\n<gallery>\nImage:Lilium lancifolium bulbils.jpg|Bulbils form in the leaf axils of ''[[Lilium lancifolium]]''\nImage:Alliumvineale1web.jpg|Wild garlic (''[[Allium vineale]]'') bulbils sprouting\nImage:Allium fistulosum bulbifera0.jpg|\"[[Tree onion]]s\" form clusters of small bulbs instead of flowers\n</gallery>\n\n==Further reading==\n* Coccoris, Patricia (2012) ''The Curious History of the Bulb Vase''.
