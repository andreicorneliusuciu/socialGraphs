The process leading to loss of material is known as \"wear\". Major types of wear include [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]], friction ([[adhesion]] and [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]]), [[erosion]], and [[corrosion]]. Wear can be minimized by modifying the surface properties of the solids by one or more \"[[surface engineering]]\" processes (also called [[surface finishing]]) or by use of [[lubricant]]s (for frictional or adhesive wear).\n\nEstimated direct and consequential annual loss to industries in the USA due to wear is approximately 1-2% of GDP. (Heinz, 1987).{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Engineered surfaces extend the working life of both original and recycled and resurfaced equipment, thus saving large sums of money and leading to conservation of material, energy and the environment. Methodologies to minimize wear include systematic approaches to diagnose the wear and to prescribe appropriate solutions. Important methods include:\n\n*Point like contact theory was established by Heinrich Hertz in 1880s.\n*Fluid lubrication dynamics was established by Arnold Johannes Sommerfeld in 1900s.\n* [[Terotechnology]], where multidisciplinary engineering and management techniques are used to protect equipment and machinery from degradation ([[Peter Jost]], 1972)\n* [[Horst Czichos]]'s systems approach, where appropriate material is selected by checking properties against tribological requirements under operating environment (H. Czichos,1978)\n* Asset Management by Material Prognosis - a concept similar to terotechnology which has been introduced by the US Military ([[DARPA]]) for upkeep of equipment in good health and start-ready condition for 24 hours. Good health monitoring systems combined with appropriate remedies at maintenance and repair stages have led to improved performance, reliability and extended life cycle of the assets, such as advanced military hardware and civil aircraft.\n\nIn recent years,{{when|date=October 2012}} micro- and [[nanotribology]] have been gaining ground. Frictional interactions in microscopically small components are becoming increasingly important for the development of new products in [[electronics]], life sciences, [[chemistry]], sensors and by extension for all modern technology.\n\n=== Friction regimes ===\n[[File:Martens curves.JPG|thumb|A typical Stribeck curve obtained by Martens]]\n[[File:Curva di Stribeck.svg|thumb|left|Stribeck curve (Abscissa: Speed, Ordinate: Friction)<br/>\n1.

These curves clearly show the minimum value of friction as the demarcation between full fluid-film lubrication and some solid asperity interactions.\n\nStribeck and others systematically studied the variation of friction between two liquid lubricated surfaces as a function of a dimensionless lubrication parameter \u03b7N/P, where \u03b7 is the dynamic viscosity (Ns/m<sup>2</sup>), N the sliding speed (m/s) and P the load projected on to the geometrical surface (usually load per unit length of bearing in N/m).<ref name=\"R.

According to da Vinci, the frictional resistance was the same for two different objects of the same weight but making contacts over different widths and lengths. He also observed that the force needed to overcome friction doubles when the weight doubles. da Vinci's findings remained unpublished in his notebooks.<ref name=\"Armstrong\" >{{cite book   \n  | last = Armstrong-H\u00e9louvry\n  | first = Brian \n  | title = Control of machines with friction\n  | publisher = Springer\n  | year = 1991\n  | location = USA\n  | pages = 10\n  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=0zk_zI3xACgC&pg=PA10\n  | isbn = 0-7923-9133-0}}</ref><ref name=\"VanBeek\">{{cite web\n  | last = van Beek\n  | first =  Anton\n  | title = History of Science Friction\n  | publisher = tribology-abc.com \n  | url = http://www.tribology-abc.com/abc/history.htm\n  | accessdate = 2011-03-24}}</ref>  Da Vinci identified the laws of friction in a notebook in 1493 and continued his studies of friction for 20 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/uploads/Hutchings_Leonardo_Friction_2016_v2.pdf|title=Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s studies of friction|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hutchings|first=Ian M.|date=2016-08-15|title=Leonardo da Vinci\u05f3s studies of friction|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043164816300588|journal=Wear|volume=360\u2013361|pages=51\u201366|doi=10.1016/j.wear.2016.04.019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-07-reveals-leonardo-da-vinci-irrelevant.html|title=Study reveals Leonardo da Vinci's 'irrelevant' scribbles mark the spot where he first recorded the laws of friction|access-date=2016-07-26}}</ref>\n\n[[Guillaume Amontons]] rediscovered the classic rules (1699), but unlike da Vinci, made his findings public at the Academie Royale des Sciences for verification.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Singer|first=Irwin|date=December 1999|title=Amontons\u2019 Rules of Friction Formulated 300 Years Ago.|url=|journal=MRS Bulletin|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> They were further developed by [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] (1785).\n\n[[Charles Hatchett]] (1760\u20131820) carried out the first reliable test on frictional wear using a simple reciprocating machine to evaluate wear on [[gold coin]]s. He found that compared to self-mated coins, coins with grits between them wore at a faster rate.\n\nMichael J Neale (1926 - 2012) was a leader the field of Tribology in the mid to late 1900's - For nearly 40 years he specialised in solving problems in machinery design by applying his knowledge of Tribology. Neale was respected as an educator with a gift for integrating theoretical work with his own practical experience to produce easy-to-understand design guides. [http://www.tribology.co.uk/articles-papers/pages-from-the-tribology-hanbook/ The Tribology Handbook], which he first edited in 1973 and updated in 1995, is used around the world and forms the basis of numerous training courses for engineering designers.\n\n=== Stribeck curve ===\n\nThe \"Stribeck curve\" or \"Stribeck\u2013Hersey curve\" (named after [[Richard Stribeck]],<ref>Stribeck, R.

Hersey]</ref>), which is used to categorize the friction properties between two surfaces, was developed in the first half of the 20th century. The research of Professor Richard Stribeck (1861\u20131950) was performed in Berlin at the Royal Prussian Technical Testing Institute (MPA, now BAM). Similar work was previously performed around 1885 by Prof. Adolf Martens (1850\u20131914) at the same Institute and in the mid-1870s by Dr. Robert H. Thurston <ref>Robert H. Thurston, Friction and lubrication - Determination of the laws and co-\u00ebfficients of friction by new methods and with new apparatus, Tr\u00fcbner and Co., Ludgate Hill, London, 1879</ref><ref>Robert H. Thurston, A treatise on friction and lost work in machinery and millwork, John Wiley&Sons, New York, 1894, fifth edition</ref> at the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] in the U.S. Prof. Dr. Thurston was therefore close to establishing the \u201cStribeck curve\u201d, but he presented no \u201cStribeck\u201d-like graphs, as he evidently did not fully believe in the relevance of this dependency.  Since that time the \u201cStribeck-curve\u201d has been a classic teaching element in tribology classes.<ref name=\"H. Czichos, K 2003\"/>\n\nThe graphs of friction force reported by Stribeck stem from a carefully conducted, wide-ranging series of experiments on [[journal bearing]]s.  Stribeck systematically studied the variation of friction between two liquid lubricated surfaces.<ref name=\"R. Stribeck 2002\"/> His results were presented on 5 December 1901 during a public session of the railway society and published on 6 September 1902.  They clearly showed the minimum value of friction as the demarcation between full fluid-film lubrication and some solid asperity interactions. Stribeck studied different bearing materials and aspect ratios D/L from 1:1 to 1:2. The maximum sliding speed was 4&nbsp;m/s and the geometrical contact pressure was limited to 5 MPa. (These operating conditions were related to railway wagon journal bearings.)\n\nThe reason why the form of the friction curve for liquid lubricated surfaces was later attributed to Stribeck, although both Thurston and Martens achieved their results considerably earlier, (Martens even in the same organization roughly 15 years before), may be because Stribeck published in the most important technical journal in Germany at that time, [[Zeitschrift des Vereins Deutscher Ingenieure]] (VDI, Journal of German Mechanical Engineers). Martens published his results \u201conly\u201d in the official journal of the [[Royal Prussian Technical Testing Institute]], which has now become BAM. The VDI journal, as one of the most important journals for engineers, provided wide access to these data and later colleagues rationalized the results into the three classical friction regimes. Thurston however, did not have the experimental means to record a continuous graph of the coefficient of friction but only measured the friction at discrete points; this may be the reason why the minimum in the coefficient of friction was not discovered by him. Instead, Thurston's data did not indicate such a pronounced minimum of friction for a liquid lubricated journal bearing as was demonstrated by the graphs of Martens and Stribeck.\n\n=== Jost Report ===\n\nThe term ''tribology'' became widely used following [[The Jost Report]] in 1966. The report said that friction, wear and corrosion were costing the UK huge sums of money every year. As a result, the [[United Kingdom|UK]] set up several national centres for tribology. Since then the term has diffused into the international engineering field, with many specialists now identifying as tribologists.\n\nThere are now numerous national and international societies, such as the ''Society for Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers'' ([http://www.stle.org STLE]) in the USA, the ''[[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]]' Tribology Group'' ([http://www.imeche.org/knowledge/industries/tribology/overview IMechE Tribology Group]) in the UK or the German Society for Tribology (Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Tribologie, www.gft-ev.de) and MYTRIBOS<ref>http://www.mytribos.org</ref> (Malaysian Tribology society).\n\nMost technical universities have researchers working on tribology, often as part of [[mechanical engineering]] departments. The limitations in tribological interactions are, however, no longer mainly determined by mechanical designs, but by material limitations. So the discipline of tribology now counts at least as many materials engineers, physicists and chemists as it does mechanical engineers. \n\n=== New areas of tribology ===\n\nSince the 1990s, new areas of tribology have emerged, including the [[nanotribology]], [[biotribology]], and [[green tribology]]. These interdisciplinary areas study the friction, wear and lubrication at the nanoscale (including the [[Atomic force microscopy]] and micro/nanoelectromechanical systems, [[MEMS]]/[[Nanoelectromechanical systems|NEMS]]), in biomedical applications (e.g., human joint prosthetics, dental materials), and ecological aspects of friction, lubrication and wear (tribology of clean energy sources, green lubricants, [[biomimetic]] tribology). \n\nRecently, intensive studies of [http://tribonet.org/so-what-is-it-superlubricity/ superlubricity] (phenomenon of vanishing friction) have sparked due to high demand in energy savings. Development of new materials, such as [[graphene]], initiated development of fundamentally [http://tribonet.org/in-situ-nanopolishing-isn-a-new-lubrication-paradigm-aimed-at-permanent-surface-perfection/ new approaches] in the lubrication field.\n\n== Applications ==\n\nThe study of tribology is commonly applied in [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] design but extends into almost all other aspects of modern technology, even to such unlikely areas as [[hair conditioner]]s and cosmetics such as [[lipstick]], [[Powder (substance)|powders]] and lip-gloss.\n\nAny product where one material slides or rubs over another is affected by complex tribological interactions, whether lubricated like hip implants and other artificial prostheses, or unlubricated as in high temperature sliding wear in which conventional lubricants cannot be used but in which the formation of [[compacted oxide layer glaze]]s have been observed to protect against wear.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nTribology plays an important role in manufacturing. In metal-forming operations, friction increases tool wear and the power required to work a piece. This results in increased costs due to more frequent tool replacement, loss of tolerance as tool dimensions shift, and greater forces required to shape a piece. The use of lubricants which minimize direct surface contact reduces tool wear and power requirements.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{colbegin|3}}\n* [[Bearing (mechanical)|Bearings]]\n* [[Cold welding]]\n* [[Contact mechanics]]\n* [[Energetically modified cement]]\n* [[Ferrography]]\n* [[Fretting]]\n* [[Friction]]\n* [[Galling]]\n* [[List of tribology organizations]]\n* [[Lubrication]]\n* [[Oil additive]]\n* [[Oil analysis]]\n* [[Peter Jost]]\n* [[Space tribology]]\n* [[Surface science]]\n* [[Tribocorrosion]]\n* [[Tribometer]]\n* [[Wear]]\n* [[Wetting]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Surface Wear \u2013 Analysis, Treatment, and Prevention: R.
