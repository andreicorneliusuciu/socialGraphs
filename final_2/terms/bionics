Steele]] in 1958, possibly originating from the [[International scientific vocabulary|technical term]] ''bion'' (pronounced ''BEE-on''; from {{lang-grc|\u03b2\u03af\u03bf\u03c2}}), meaning 'unit of [[life]]' and the suffix ''-ic'', meaning 'like' or 'in the manner of', hence 'like life'. Some dictionaries, however, explain the word as being formed as a [[portmanteau]] from '''''bio'''logy'' and ''electro'''nics'''''. It was popularized by the 1970s U.S. television series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' and ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'', both based upon the novel ''[[Cyborg (novel)|Cyborg]]'' by [[Martin Caidin]], which was itself influenced by Steele's work. All feature humans given superhuman powers by [[electromechanical]] implants.\n\nThe [[technology transfer|transfer of technology]] between lifeforms and manufactures is, according to proponents of bionic technology, desirable because evolutionary pressure typically forces living organisms, including fauna and flora, to become highly optimized and efficient. A classical example is the development of dirt- and water-repellent paint (coating) from the observation that the surface of the [[Nelumbo|lotus flower]] plant is practically [[non-stick|unsticky]] for anything (the [[lotus effect]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.\n\nThe term \"biomimetic\" is preferred when reference is made to chemical reactions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}  In that domain, biomimetic chemistry refers to reactions that, in nature, involve biological [[macromolecules]] (e.g. enzymes or nucleic acids) whose chemistry can be replicated ''in vitro'' using much smaller molecules.\n\nExamples of bionics in engineering include the hulls of boats imitating the thick skin of dolphins; [[sonar]], [[radar]], and medical [[ultrasound]] imaging imitating [[animal echolocation]].\n\nIn the field of computer science, the study of bionics has produced [[artificial neurons]], [[neural network|artificial neural networks]],<ref>[http://www.duke.edu/~jme17/Joshua_E._Mendoza-Elias/Research_Interests.html#Neuroscience_-_Neural_Plasticity_in Research Interests] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114000000/http://www.duke.edu/~jme17/Joshua_E._Mendoza-Elias/Research_Interests.html#Neuroscience_-_Neural_Plasticity_in |date=14 November 2012 }}.

[[Evolutionary computation]] was also motivated by bionics ideas but it took the idea further by simulating evolution [[in silico]] and producing well-optimized solutions that had never appeared in nature.\n\nIt is estimated by [[Julian Vincent]], professor of [[biomimetics]] at the [[University of Bath]]'s  Department of Mechanical Engineering, that \"at present there is only a 12% overlap between [[biology]] and technology in terms of the mechanisms used\".<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Vincent, J.

The term bionics was coined by [[Jack E. Steele]] in 1958 while working at the ''Aeronautics Division House'' at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. However, terms like biomimicry or biomimetics are more preferred in the technology world in efforts to avoid confusion between the medical term bionics. Coincidentally, Martin Caidin used the word for his 1972 novel ''[[Cyborg (novel)|Cyborg]]'', which inspired the series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''. Caidin was a long-time aviation industry writer before turning to fiction full-time.\n\n== Methods ==\n[[File:Bur Macro BlackBg.jpg|thumb|right|[[Velcro]] was inspired by the tiny hooks found on the surface of [[bur]]s.]]\nOften, the study of bionics emphasizes implementing a function found in nature rather than just imitating biological structures. For example, in computer science, [[cybernetics]] tries to model the feedback and control mechanisms that are inherent in intelligent behavior, while [[artificial intelligence]] tries to model the intelligent function regardless of the particular way it can be achieved.\n\nThe conscious copying of examples and mechanisms from natural organisms and ecologies is a form of applied [[case-based reasoning]], treating nature itself as a database of solutions that already work. Proponents argue that the [[selective pressure]] placed on all [[life|natural life forms]] minimizes and removes failures.\n\nAlthough almost all [[engineering]] could be said to be a form of [[biomimicry]], the modern origins of this field are usually attributed to [[Buckminster Fuller]] and its later codification as a house or field of study to [[Janine Benyus]].\n\nRoughly, we can distinguish three biological levels in the fauna or flora, after which technology can be modeled:\n*Mimicking natural '''methods of manufacture'''\n*Imitating '''mechanisms''' found in nature ([[velcro]])\n*Studying '''organizational principles from the [[Collective animal behavior|social behaviour of organisms]]''', such as the [[Flocking (behaviour)|flocking behaviour]] of birds, optimization of [[Ant colony optimization|ant foraging]] and [[Bee colony optimization|bee foraging]], and the swarm intelligence (SI)-based behaviour of a [[Shoaling and schooling|school of fish]].\n\n== Examples ==\n* In [[robotics]], bionics and biomimetics are used to apply the way animals move to the design of robots.  [[BionicKangaroo]] was based on the movements and physiology of kangaroos.\n*[[Velcro]] is the most famous example of biomimetics.  In 1948, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] engineer [[Georges de Mestral|George de Mestral]] was cleaning his dog of burrs picked up on a walk when he realized how the hooks of the [[Burr (fruit)|burr]]s clung to the fur.\n*The horn-shaped, saw-tooth design for [[lumberjack]] blades used at the turn of the 19th century to cut down trees when it was still done by hand was modeled after observations of a wood-burrowing [[beetle]]. It revolutionized the industry because the blades worked so much faster at felling trees.\n*[[Cat's eye (road)|Cat's eye reflectors]] were invented by [[Percy Shaw]] in 1935 after studying the mechanism of cat eyes. He had found that cats had a system of reflecting cells, known as [[tapetum lucidum]], which was capable of reflecting the tiniest bit of light.\n*[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s flying machines and ships are early examples of drawing from nature in engineering.\n*[[Resilin]] is a replacement for rubber that has been created by studying the material also found in arthropods.\n*Julian Vincent drew from the study of [[Conifer cone|pinecones]] when he developed in 2004 \"smart\" clothing that adapts to changing temperatures.  \"I wanted a nonliving [[system]] which would respond to changes in moisture by changing shape\", he said. \"There are several such systems in plants, but most are very small \u2014 the pinecone is the largest and therefore the easiest to work on\".  Pinecones respond to higher humidity by opening their scales (to disperse their seeds). The \"smart\" fabric does the same thing, opening up when the wearer is warm and sweating, and shutting tight when cold.\n*\"Morphing aircraft wings\" that change shape according to the speed and duration of flight were designed in 2004 by biomimetic scientists from [[Penn State University]]. The morphing wings were inspired by different bird species that have differently shaped wings according to the speed at which they fly.  In order to change the shape and underlying structure of the aircraft wings, the researchers needed to make the overlying skin also be able to change, which their design does by covering the wings with fish-inspired scales that could slide over each other. In some respects this is a refinement of the [[swing-wing]] design.\n\n[[Image:Lotus3.jpg|thumb|Lotus leaf surface, [[3D computer graphics|rendered]]: microscopic view]]\n*Some paints and roof tiles have been engineered to be self-cleaning by copying the mechanism from the [[Nelumbo|Nelumbo lotus]].<ref>[http://www.treehugger.com/files/2005/09/sto_lotusan_bio.php Sto Lotusan \u2014 Biomimicry Paint].

They change color because their molecules are arranged in a [[helix|helical]] or [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] arrangement and with temperature the pitch of that helical structure changes, reflecting different [[wavelength]]s of light.  [[Chiral Photonics, Inc.]] has abstracted the self-assembled structure of the organic CLCs to produce analogous optical devices using tiny lengths of inorganic, twisted [[optical fiber|glass fiber]].\n*[[Nanostructures]] and physical mechanisms that produce the shining color of [[butterfly]] wings were reproduced [[in silico]] by [[Greg Parker]], professor of Electronics and Computer Science at the [[University of Southampton]] and research student [[Luca Plattner]] in the field of [[photonics]], which is [[electronics]] using [[photons]] as the information carrier instead of [[electrons]].\n* The wing structure of the blue [[morpho butterfly]] was studied and the way it reflects light was mimicked to create an [[RFID]] tag that can be read through water and on metal.<ref>[http://www.rfidradio.com/?p=26 RFID Through Water and on Metal with 99.9% Reliability (Episode 015)], RFID Radio</ref>\n* The wing structure of butterflies has also inspired the creation of new nanosensors to detect explosives.<ref>[http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-08/13/butterfly-wing-nanosensors Nanosensors inspired by butterfly wings (Wired UK)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017124358/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-08/13/butterfly-wing-nanosensors |date=17 October 2010 }}.

Hence, there are two slightly different points of view regarding the meaning of the word.\n\nIn medicine, '''bionics''' means the replacement or enhancement of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] or other body parts by mechanical versions. Bionic implants differ from mere [[prosthesis|prostheses]] by mimicking the original function very closely, or even surpassing it.\n\nBionics' German equivalent, ''Bionik'', always adheres to the broader meaning, in that it tries to develop engineering solutions from biological models. This approach is motivated by the fact that biological solutions will usually be optimized by [[evolutionary]] forces.\n\nWhile the technologies that make bionic implants possible are still in infancy, a few bionic items already exist, the best known being the [[cochlear implant]], a device for [[deaf]] people. By 2004 fully functional [[artificial heart]]s were developed. Significant progress is expected with the advent of [[nanotechnology]]. A well-known example of a proposed nanodevice is a [[respirocyte]], an artificial red cell, designed (though not built yet) by [[Robert Freitas]].\n\nKwabena Boahen from [[Ghana]] was a professor in the Department of Bioengineering at the '''University of Pennsylvania'''. During his eight years at Penn, he developed a [[silicon]] [[retina]] that was able to process images in the same manner as a living retina. He confirmed the results by comparing the electrical signals from his silicon retina to the electrical signals produced by a [[salamander]] eye while the two retinas were looking at the same image.\n\nIn 2007 the Scottish company [[Touch Bionics]] launched the first commercially available bionic hand, named \"i-Limb Hand\". According to the firm, by May 2010 it has been fitted to more than 1,200 patients worldwide.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1273258/i-Limb-Pulse-Bionic-hand-uses-wireless-technology-unveiled.html Bionic hand that uses wireless technology unveiled], Mail Online, 6 May 2010</ref>\n\nThe Nichi-In group is working on biomimicking scaffolds in tissue engineering, stem cells and regenerative medicine have given a detailed classification on biomimetics in medicine.<ref>[http://www.ncrm.org/biomimetics.htm Biomimetics and NCRM, Nichi-In classification of Biomimetics Biomimicry tissue engineering, stem cells, cell therapy].

Ray Flynn, 80, has dry age-related macular degeneration which has led to the total loss of his central vision. He is using a retinal implant which converts video images from a miniature video camera worn on his glasses. He can now make out the direction of white lines on a computer screen using the retinal implant.\" The implant, known as the [[Argus retinal prosthesis#History|Argus II]] and manufactured in the US by the company [[Second Sight Medical Products]], had been used previously in patients who were blind as the result of the rare inherited degenerative eye disease [[retinitis pigmentosa]].<ref name=\"BBC News 21 July 2015\">{{cite web | title= Bionic eye implant world first|url=  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-33571412| last= Walsh| first= Fergus|date= 22 July 2015| website= [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate= 21 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Politics ===\nA political form of biomimicry is [[bioregional democracy]], wherein political borders conform to natural [[ecoregions]] rather than human cultures or the outcomes of prior conflicts.\n\nCritics of these approaches often argue that [[ecological selection]] itself is a poor model of minimizing [[manufacturing complexity]] or conflict, and that the [[free market]] relies on conscious cooperation, agreement, and standards as much as on efficiency \u2013 more analogous to [[sexual selection]]. [[Charles Darwin]] himself contended that both were balanced in [[natural selection]] \u2013 although his contemporaries often avoided frank talk about sex, or any suggestion that free market success was based on persuasion, not value.\n\nAdvocates, especially in the [[anti-globalization movement]], argue that the mating-like processes of standardization, financing and marketing, are already examples of [[runaway evolution]] \u2013 rendering a system that appeals to the consumer but which is inefficient at use of energy and raw materials.  Biomimicry, they argue, is an effective strategy to restore basic efficiency.\n\nBiomimicry is also the second principle of [[Natural Capitalism]].\n\n=== Other uses ===\n\n[[Business biomimetics]] is the latest development in the application of biomimetics. Specifically it applies principles and practice from biological systems to business strategy, process, organisation design and strategic thinking. It has been successfully used by a range of industries in FMCG, defence, central government, packaging and business services. Based on the work by Phil Richardson at the [[University of Bath]]<ref>[http://www.bath.ac.uk/mech-eng/biomimetics/ Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Bath] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817164045/http://www.bath.ac.uk/mech-eng/biomimetics/ |date=17 August 2009 }}. Bath.ac.uk (21 February 2009). Retrieved on 2011-04-23.</ref> the approach was launched at the House of Lords in May 2009.\n\nIn a more specific meaning, it is a [[creativity techniques|creativity technique]] that tries to use [[nature|biological]] prototypes to get ideas for engineering solutions. This approach is motivated by the fact that biological organisms and their organs have been well optimized by [[evolution]]. In chemistry,  a '''biomimetic synthesis''' is a [[chemical synthesis]] inspired by [[biochemistry|biochemical]] processes.\n\nAnother, more recent meaning of the term bionics refers to merging organism and machine. This approach results in a hybrid system combining  biological and engineering parts, which can also be referred as a cybernetic organism ([[cyborg]]). Practical realization of this was demonstrated in [[Kevin Warwick]]'s implant experiments bringing about [[ultrasound]] input via his own nervous system.\n\n== See also ==\n{{colbegin|3}}\n*[[Biomechatronics]]\n*[[Biomedical engineering]]\n*[[Biomimetics]]\n*''[[The Bionic Woman]]''\n*''[[Bionic Woman (2007 TV series)]]''\n*[[Bionic architecture]]\n*[[Biophysics]]\n*[[Biotechnology]]\n*[[Cyborg]]\n*''[[Cyborg (novel)]]''\n*[[History of technology]]\n*[[Implant (medicine)|Implant]]\n*[[Index of environmental articles]]\n*[[Machine]]\n*[[Prosthesis]]\n*''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature. 1997.
