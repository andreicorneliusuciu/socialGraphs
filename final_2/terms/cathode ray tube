The images may represent electrical [[waveform]]s ([[oscilloscope]]), pictures (television, [[computer monitor]]), [[radar]] targets, or others. CRTs have also been [[Williams tube|used as memory devices]], in which case the visible light emitted from the fluorescent material (if any) is not intended to have significant meaning to a visual observer (though the visible pattern on the tube face may cryptically represent the stored data).\n\nThe CRT uses an evacuated glass envelope which is large, deep (i.e. long from front screen face to rear end), fairly heavy, and relatively fragile. As a matter of safety, the face is typically made of thick [[lead glass]] so as to be highly shatter-resistant and to block most [[X-ray]] emissions, particularly if the CRT is used in a consumer product. Since the late 2000s, CRTs have largely been superseded by newer display technologies such as [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]], [[plasma display]], and [[OLED]] screens, which have lower manufacturing costs and power consumption, and significantly less weight and bulk. Newer display technologies can also be made in larger sizes; whereas 38\" to 40\" was about the largest size of a CRT TV, new display technologies are available in 50\" to 60\" and even larger sizes.

He observed that some unknown rays were emitted from the [[cathode]] (negative electrode) which could cast shadows on the glowing wall of the tube, indicating the rays were traveling in straight lines. In 1890, [[Arthur Schuster]] demonstrated cathode rays could be deflected by [[electric field]]s, and [[William Crookes]] showed they could be deflected by magnetic fields. In 1897, [[J. J. Thomson]] succeeded in measuring the mass of cathode rays, showing that they consisted of negatively charged particles smaller than atoms, the first \"[[subatomic particle]]s\", which were later named ''[[electron]]s''. The earliest version of the CRT was known as the \"Braun tube\", invented by the German physicist [[Ferdinand Braun]] in 1897.<ref>Ferdinand Braun (1897) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89048352892;view=1up;seq=568 \"Ueber ein Verfahren zur Demonstration und zum Studium des zeitlichen Verlaufs variabler Str\u00f6me\"] (On a process for the display and study of the course in time of variable currents), ''Annalen der Physik und Chemie'', 3rd series, '''60''': 552\u2013559.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Cathode Ray Tube|year=2007|work=Medical Discoveries|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|url=http://www.discoveriesinmedicine.com/Bar-Cod/Cathode-Ray-Tube-CRT.html|accessdate=27 April 2008}}</ref> It was a [[cold cathode|cold-cathode]] [[diode]], a modification of the [[Crookes tube]] with a [[phosphor]]-coated screen.\n\nIn 1907, Russian scientist [[Boris Rosing]] used a CRT in the receiving end of an experimental [[video signal]] to form a picture. He managed to display simple geometric shapes onto the screen, which marked the first time that CRT technology was used for what is now known as television.<ref name=crthistory/>\n\nThe first cathode ray tube to use a [[hot cathode]] was developed by [[John B. Johnson]] (who gave his name to the term [[Johnson\u2013Nyquist noise|Johnson noise]]) and Harry Weiner Weinhart of [[Western Electric]], and became a commercial product in 1922.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Cathode Ray Tube and its Applications|journal=International Journal of Innovative Research in Technology|volume=1}}</ref>\n\nIt was named by inventor [[Vladimir K.

The beam is deflected horizontally by applying an [[electric field]] between a pair of plates to its left and right, and vertically by applying an electric field to plates above and below. Televisions use magnetic rather than electrostatic deflection because the deflection plates obstruct the beam when the deflection angle is as large as is required for tubes that are relatively short for their size.\n\n===Phosphor persistence===\nVarious [[phosphor]]s are available depending upon the needs of the measurement or display application. The brightness, color, and persistence of the illumination depends upon the type of phosphor used on the CRT screen. Phosphors are available with persistences ranging from less than one [[microsecond]] to several seconds.<ref>{{cite book |last= Doebelin |first= Ernest |title= Measurement Systems |publisher= McGraw Hill Professional |year= 2003 |page= 972 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=q1mOopLHnTEC&pg=PA972 |isbn=978-0-07-292201-1}}</ref> For visual observation of brief transient events, a long persistence phosphor may be desirable.

Oscilloscope CRTs designed for very fast signals can give a brighter display by passing the electron beam through a [[micro-channel plate]] just before it reaches the screen. Through the phenomenon of [[secondary emission]], this plate multiplies the number of electrons reaching the phosphor screen, giving a significant improvement in writing rate (brightness) and improved sensitivity and spot size as well.<ref>{{cite book |last= Williams |first= Jim |title= Analog circuit design: art, science, and personalities |publisher= Newnes |year= 1991 |pages= 115\u2013116 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=CFoEAP2lwLEC&pg=PA115 |isbn= 978-0-7506-9640-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Yen, William M. |author2=Shionoya, Shigeo |author3=Yamamoto, Hajime |title= Practical Applications of Phosphors |publisher= CRC Press |year= 2006 |page= 211 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=cKMSf0iRVSgC&pg=PA211 |isbn=978-1-4200-4369-3}}</ref>\n\n===Graticules===\nMost oscilloscopes have a [[oscilloscope#Graticule|graticule]] as part of the visual display, to facilitate measurements. The graticule may be permanently marked inside the face of the CRT, or it may be a transparent external plate made of glass or [[acrylic glass|acrylic]] plastic. An internal graticule eliminates [[parallax error]], but cannot be changed to accommodate different types of measurements.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Bakshi, U.A. |author2=Godse, A.P. |title= Electronic Devices And Circuits |publisher= Technical Publications |year= 2008 |page= 38 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=uJaQML8-MggC&pg=PA38 |isbn=978-81-8431-332-1}}</ref> Oscilloscopes commonly provide a means for the graticule to be illuminated from the side, which improves its visibility.<ref>{{cite book |last= Hickman |first= Ian |title= Oscilloscopes: how to use them, how they work |publisher= Newnes |year= 2001 |page= 47 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=O2oj04vbQqgC&pg=PA47 |isbn=978-0-7506-4757-1}}</ref>\n\n===Image storage tubes===\n[[File:Tektronix 564 Analog Storage Oscilloscope.jpg|thumbnail|The Tektronix Type 564: First Mass Produced Analog Phosphor Storage Oscilloscope]]\nThese are found in ''[[analog television|analog]] phosphor storage oscilloscopes''. These are distinct from ''[[digital storage oscilloscope]]s'' which rely on solid state digital memory to store the image.\n\nWhere a single brief event is monitored by an oscilloscope, such an event will be displayed by a conventional tube only while it actually occurs. The use of a long persistence phosphor may allow the image to be observed after the event, but only for a few seconds at best. This limitation can be overcome by the use of a direct view storage cathode ray tube (storage tube). A storage tube will continue to display the event after it has occurred until such time as it is erased. A storage tube is similar to a conventional tube except that it is equipped with a metal grid coated with a [[dielectric]] layer located immediately behind the phosphor screen. An externally applied voltage to the mesh initially ensures that the whole mesh is at a constant potential. This mesh is constantly exposed to a low velocity electron beam from a 'flood gun' which operates independently of the main gun. This flood gun is not deflected like the main gun but constantly 'illuminates' the whole of the storage mesh. The initial charge on the storage mesh is such as to repel the electrons from the flood gun which are prevented from striking the phosphor screen.\n\nWhen the main electron gun writes an image to the screen, the energy in the main beam is sufficient to create a 'potential relief' on the storage mesh. The areas where this relief is created no longer repel the electrons from the flood gun which now pass through the mesh and illuminate the phosphor screen. Consequently, the image that was briefly traced out by the main gun continues to be displayed after it has occurred. The image can be 'erased' by resupplying the external voltage to the mesh restoring its constant potential. The time for which the image can be displayed was limited because, in practice, the flood gun slowly neutralises the charge on the storage mesh. One way of allowing the image to be retained for longer is temporarily to turn off the flood gun. It is then possible for the image to be retained for several days. The majority of storage tubes allow for a lower voltage to be applied to the storage mesh which slowly restores the initial charge state. By varying this voltage a variable persistence is obtained. Turning off the flood gun and the voltage supply to the storage mesh allows such a tube to operate as a conventional oscilloscope tube.<ref>The [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd Edition (1970\u20131979)</ref>\n\n===Data storage tubes===\n{{Main|Williams tube}}\nThe Williams tube or Williams-Kilburn tube was a cathode ray tube used to electronically store binary data. It was used in computers of the 1940s as a random-access digital storage device. In contrast to other CRTs in this article, the Williams tube was not a display device, and in fact could not be viewed since a metal plate covered its screen.\n\n==Color CRTs==\n[[File:CRT screen. closeup.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Magnified view of a delta-gun [[shadow mask]] color CRT]]\n[[File:CRT Phosphors.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Magnified view of a [[Trinitron]] color CRT]]\n[[File:CRT phosphors.png|thumb|right|Spectra of constituent blue, green and red phosphors in a common CRT]]\nColor tubes use three different phosphors which emit red, green, and blue light respectively. They are packed together in stripes (as in [[aperture grille]] designs) or clusters called [[Triad (computers)|\"triads\"]] (as in [[shadow mask]] CRTs).<ref name=crtmonitorwork>{{cite web |url=http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/2006/03/20/how_crt_and_lcd_monitors_work/1 |title=How CRT and LCD monitors work |accessdate=4 October 2009 |work=bit-tech.net}}</ref> Color CRTs have three electron guns, one for each primary color, arranged either in a straight line or in an [[equilateral triangle|equilateral triangular]] configuration (the guns are usually constructed as a single unit). (The triangular configuration is often called \"delta-gun\", based on its relation to the shape of the Greek letter delta \u0394.) A grille or mask absorbs the electrons that would otherwise hit the wrong phosphor.<ref name=maskgrill>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/crt/crtMask-c.html |title=The Shadow Mask and Aperture Grill |work=PC Guide}}</ref> A [[shadow mask]] tube uses a metal plate with tiny holes, placed so that the electron beam only illuminates the correct phosphors on the face of the tube;<ref name=crtmonitorwork/> the holes are tapered so that the electrons that strike the inside of any hole will be reflected back, if they are not absorbed (e.g. due to local charge accumulation), instead of bouncing through the hole to strike a random (wrong) spot on the screen. Another type of color CRT uses an [[aperture grille]] of tensioned vertical wires to achieve the same result.<ref name=maskgrill/>\n\n===Convergence and purity in color CRTs===\nDue to limitations in the dimensional precision with which CRTs can be manufactured economically, it has not been practically possible to build color CRTs in which three electron beams could be aligned to hit phosphors of respective color in acceptable coordination, solely on the basis of the geometric configuration of the electron gun axes and gun aperture positions, shadow mask apertures, etc. The shadow mask ensures that one beam will only hit spots of certain colors of phosphors, but minute variations in physical alignment of the internal parts among individual CRTs will cause variations in the exact alignment of the beams through the shadow mask, allowing some electrons from, for example, the red beam to hit, say, blue phosphors, unless some individual compensation is made for the variance among individual tubes.\n\nColor convergence and color purity are two aspects of this single problem. Firstly, for correct color rendering it is necessary that regardless of where the beams are deflected on the screen, all three hit the same spot (and nominally pass through the same hole or slot) on the shadow mask. This is called convergence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimateavmag.com/howto/305picture/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126054428/http://www.ultimateavmag.com/howto/305picture/|archivedate=26 November 2009|title=Picture This|date=March 2005|author=Norton, Thomas J. |work= UltimateAVmag.com}}</ref> More specifically, the convergence at the center of the screen (with no deflection field applied by the yoke) is called static convergence, and the convergence over the rest of the screen area is called dynamic convergence. The beams may converge at the center of the screen and yet stray from each other as they are deflected toward the edges; such a CRT would be said to have good static convergence but poor dynamic convergence. Secondly, each beam must only strike the phosphors of the\ncolor it is intended to strike and no others. This is called purity. Like convergence, there is static purity and dynamic purity, with the same meanings of \"static\" and \"dynamic\" as for convergence. Convergence and purity are distinct parameters; a CRT could have good purity but poor convergence, or vice versa. Poor convergence causes color \"shadows\" or \"ghosts\" along displayed edges and contours, as if the image on the screen were intaglio printed with poor registration. Poor purity causes objects on the screen to appear off-color while their edges remain sharp. Purity and convergence problems can occur at the same time, in the same or different areas of the screen or both over the whole screen, and either uniformly or to greater or lesser degrees over different parts of the screen.\n\nThe solution to the static convergence and purity problems is a set of color alignment magnets installed around the neck of the CRT. These movable weak permanent magnets are usually mounted on the back end of the deflection yoke assembly and are set at the factory to compensate for any static purity and convergence errors that are intrinsic to the unadjusted tube. Typically there are two or three pairs of two magnets in the form of rings made of plastic impregnated with a magnetic material, with their [[magnetic fields]] parallel to the planes of the magnets, which are perpendicular to the electron gun axes. Each pair of magnetic rings forms a single effective magnet whose field [[vector field|vector]] can be fully and freely adjusted (in both direction and magnitude). By rotating a pair of magnets relative to each other, their relative field alignment can be varied, adjusting the effective field strength of the pair. (As they rotate relative to each other, each magnet's field can be considered to have two opposing components at right angles, and these four components [two each for two magnets] form two pairs, one pair reinforcing each other and the other pair opposing and canceling each other. Rotating away from alignment, the magnets' mutually reinforcing field components decrease as they are traded for increasing opposed, mutually cancelling components.) By rotating a pair of magnets together, preserving the relative angle between them, the direction of their collective magnetic field can be varied. Overall, adjusting all of the convergence/purity magnets allows a finely tuned slight electron beam deflection or lateral offset to be applied, which compensates for minor static convergence and purity errors intrinsic to the uncalibrated tube. Once set, these magnets are usually glued in place, but normally they can be freed and readjusted in the field (e.g. by a TV repair shop) if necessary.\n\nOn some CRTs, additional fixed adjustable magnets are added for dynamic convergence or dynamic purity at specific points on the screen, typically near the corners or edges. Further adjustment of dynamic convergence and purity typically cannot be done passively, but requires active compensation circuits.\n\nDynamic color convergence and purity are one of the main reasons why until late in their history, CRTs were long-necked (deep) and had biaxially curved faces; these geometric design characteristics are necessary for intrinsic passive dynamic color convergence and purity. Only starting around the 1990s did sophisticated active dynamic convergence compensation circuits become available that made short-necked and flat-faced CRTs workable. These active compensation circuits use the deflection yoke to finely adjust beam deflection according to the beam target location. The same techniques (and major circuit components) also make possible the adjustment of display image rotation, skew, and other complex [[raster graphics|raster]] geometry parameters through electronics under user control.\n\n===Degaussing===\nIf the shadow mask becomes magnetized, its magnetic field deflects the electron beams passing through it, causing color purity distortion as the beams bend through the mask holes and hit some phosphors of a color other than that which they are intended to strike; e.g. some electrons from the red beam may hit blue phosphors, giving pure red parts of the image a magenta tint. (Magenta is the additive combination of red and blue.) This effect is localized to a specific area of the screen if the magnetization of the shadow mask is localized. Therefore, it is important that the shadow mask is unmagnetized. (A magnetized aperture grille has a similar effect, and everything stated in this subsection about shadow masks applies as well to aperture grilles.)\n\nMost color CRT displays, i.e. television sets and computer monitors, each have a built-in [[degaussing]] (demagnetizing) circuit, the primary component of which is a degaussing coil which is mounted around the perimeter of the CRT face inside the [[wikt:bezel|bezel]]. Upon power-up of the CRT display, the degaussing circuit produces a brief, alternating current through the degaussing coil which smoothly decays in strength (fades out) to zero over a period of a few seconds, producing a decaying alternating magnetic field from the coil. This degaussing field is strong enough to remove shadow mask magnetization in most cases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/crt/crtGauss-c.html|title=Magnetization and Degaussing|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref> In unusual cases of strong magnetization where the internal degaussing field is not sufficient, the shadow mask may be degaussed externally with a stronger portable degausser or demagnetizer. However, an excessively strong magnetic field, whether alternating or constant, may mechanically [[deformation (engineering)|deform]] (bend) the shadow mask, causing a permanent color distortion on the display which looks very similar to a magnetization effect.\n\nThe degaussing circuit is often built of a [[thermo-electricity|thermo-electric]] (not electronic) device containing a small ceramic heating element and a positive thermal [[coefficient of thermal expansion|coefficient]] (PTC) [[resistor-capacitor circuit|resistor]], connected directly to the switched [[AC power]] line with the resistor in series with the degaussing coil. When the power is switched on, the heating element heats the PTC resistor, increasing its resistance to a point where degaussing current is minimal, but not actually zero. In older CRT displays, this low-level current (which produces no significant degaussing field) is sustained along with the action of the heating element as long as the display remains switched on. To repeat a degaussing cycle, the CRT display must be switched off and left off for at least several seconds to reset the degaussing circuit by allowing the PTC resistor to cool to the [[ambient temperature]]; switching the display-off and immediately back on will result in a weak degaussing cycle or effectively no degaussing cycle.\n\nThis simple design is effective and cheap to build, but it wastes some power continuously. Later models, especially [[Energy Star]] rated ones, use a [[relay]] to switch the entire degaussing circuit on and off, so that the degaussing circuit uses energy only when it is functionally active and needed. The relay design also enables degaussing on user demand through the unit's front panel controls, without switching the unit off and on again. This relay can often be heard clicking off at the end of the degaussing cycle a few seconds after the monitor is turned on, and on and off during a manually initiated degaussing cycle.\n\n==Vector monitors==\n{{Main|Vector monitor}}\nVector monitors were used in early computer aided design systems and are in some late-1970s to mid-1980s arcade games such as ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title= Supercade: A Visual History of the Videogame Age, 1971\u20131984 |author= Van Burnham |publisher= MIT Press |year= 2001 |isbn= 0-262-52420-1}}</ref>\nThey draw graphics point-to-point, rather than scanning a raster. Either monochrome or color CRTs can be used in vector displays, and the essential principles of CRT design and operation are the same for either type of display; the main difference is in the beam deflection patterns and circuits.\n\n==CRT resolution==\n[[Dot pitch]] defines the maximum resolution of the display, assuming delta-gun CRTs. In these, as the scanned resolution approaches the dot pitch resolution, [[moir\u00e9]] appears, as the detail being displayed is finer than what the shadow mask can render.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.displaymate.com/moire.html |title= Moir\u00e9 Interference Patterns |accessdate=4 October 2006 |work=DisplayMate Technologies website}}</ref> Aperture grille monitors do not suffer from vertical moir\u00e9; however, because their phosphor stripes have no vertical detail. In smaller CRTs, these strips maintain position by themselves, but larger aperture-grille CRTs require one or two crosswise (horizontal) support strips.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/question406.htm |title=What causes the faint horizontal lines on my monitor? |accessdate=4 October 2009 |work=HowStuffWorks}}</ref>\n\n==Gamma==\nCRTs have a pronounced [[triode]] characteristic, which results in significant [[gamma correction|gamma]] (a nonlinear relationship in an electron gun between applied video voltage and beam intensity).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/broadcasting_gamma_correction/ |title=Gamma correction |accessdate=4 October 2009 |last=Robin |first=Michael |date=1 January 2005 |work=BroadcastEngineering |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531130845/http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/broadcasting_gamma_correction/ |archivedate=31 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Other types==\n\n===Cat's eye===\n{{Main|Magic eye tube}}\nIn better quality old-fashioned tube radio sets, a tuning guide consisting of a phosphor tube was used to aid the tuning adjustment. This was also known as a \"Magic Eye\" or \"Tuning Eye\". Tuning would be adjusted until the width of a radial shadow was minimized. This was used instead of a more expensive electromechanical meter, which later came to be used on higher-end tuners when transistor sets lacked the high voltage required to drive the device.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vacuumtube.com/eyetubes.htm |title=Tuning-Eye Tubes |accessdate=1 December 2009 |publisher=vacuumtube.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423055711/http://www.vacuumtube.com/eyetubes.htm |archivedate=23 April 2009}}</ref> The same type of device was used with tape recorders as a recording level meter, and for various other applications including electrical test equipment.\n\n===Charactrons===\nSome displays for early computers (those that needed to display more text than was practical using vectors, or that required high speed for photographic output) used [[Charactron]] CRTs. These incorporate a perforated metal character mask ([[stencil]]), which shapes a wide electron beam to form a character on the screen. The system selects a character on the mask using one set of deflection circuits, but that causes the extruded beam to be aimed off-axis, so a second set of deflection plates has to re-aim the beam so it is headed toward the center of the screen. A third set of plates places the character wherever required. The beam is unblanked (turned on) briefly to draw the character at that position. Graphics could be drawn by selecting the position on the mask corresponding to the code for a space (in practice, they were simply not drawn), which had a small round hole in the center; this effectively disabled the character mask, and the system reverted to regular vector behavior. Charactrons had exceptionally long necks, because of the need for three deflection systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=2735956|title=CATHODE RAY APPARATUS|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=2824250|title=INPUT|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Nimo===\n{{Main|Nimo tube}}\n[[File:Nimo tube BA0000-P31 showing digit 9.jpg|thumb|right|Nimo tube BA0000-P31]]\nNimo was the trademark of a family of small specialised CRTs manufactured by Industrial Electronics Engineers. These had 10 electron guns which produced electron beams in the form of digits in a manner similar to that of the charactron. The tubes were either simple single-digit displays or more complex 4- or 6- digit displays produced by means of a suitable magnetic deflection system. Having little of the complexities of a standard CRT, the tube required a relatively simple driving circuit, and as the image was projected on the glass face, it provided a much wider viewing angle than competitive types (e.g., [[nixie tube]]s).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tube-tester.com/sites/nixie/dat_arch/BA0000-P31.pdf |title=IEE Nimo CRT 10-gun readout tube datasheet |format=PDF |work=tube-tester.com|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Flood beam CRT===\nFlood beam CRT's are small tubes that are arranged as pixels for large screens like [[Jumbotron]]<nowiki/>s. The first screen using this technology was introduced by [[Mitsubishi Electric]] for the [[1980 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]. It differs from a normal CRT in that the electron gun within does not produce a focused controllable beam. Instead, electrons are sprayed in a wide cone across the entire front of the phosphor screen, basically making each unit act as a single light bulb.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.decadecounter.com/vta/articleview.php?item=947|title= Futaba TL-3508XA 'Jumbotron' Display|date= 11 March 2010|accessdate= 2014-12-19|website= The Vintage Technology Association: Military Industrial Electronics Research Preservation|publisher= The Vintage Technology Association}}</ref> Each one is coated with a red, green or blue phosphor, to make up the color sub-pixels.

The demand for CRT screens has dropped precipitously since 2007, and this falloff had accelerated in the last two years of that decade. The rapid advances and falling prices of [[liquid-crystal display|LCD]] [[flat panel]] technology, first for computer monitors and then for televisions, has been the key factor in the demise of competing display technologies such as CRT, [[rear-projection television|rear-projection]], and [[plasma display]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Wong|first=May|title=Flat Panels Drive Old TVs From Market |publisher=AP via USA Today |date= 22 October 2006 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/gear/2006-10-22-crt-demise_x.htm |accessdate=8 October 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe end of most high-end CRT production by around 2010<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.veritasetvisus.com/LCDTVA/LCDTVA-8,%20Spring-Summer%202009.pdf |title= The Standard TV|publisher= Veritas et Visus |accessdate=12 June 2008}}</ref> (including high-end Sony and Mitsubishi product lines) means an erosion of the CRT's capability.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060120/news_1n20sony.html |title=End of an era |publisher=The San Diego Union-Tribune |date=20 January 2006 |accessdate=12 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.engadgethd.com/2005/12/01/matsushita-says-good-bye-to-crts/ |title=Matsushita says good-bye to CRTs |publisher=engadgetHD |date=1 December 2005 |accessdate=12 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114110526/http://www.engadgethd.com/2005/12/01/matsushita-says-good-bye-to-crts/ |archivedate=14 January 2009}}</ref> In Canada and the United States, the sale and production of high-end CRT TVs (30-inch screens) in these markets had all but ended by 2007. Just a couple of years later, inexpensive combo CRT TVs (20-inch screens with an integrated VHS player) disappeared from discount stores. It has been common to replace CRT-based televisions and monitors in as little as 5\u20136 years, although they generally are capable of satisfactory performance for a much longer time.\n\nCompanies are responding to this trend. Electronics retailers such as Best Buy have been steadily reducing store spaces for CRTs. In 2005, Sony announced that they would stop the production of CRT computer displays. Samsung did not introduce any CRT models for the 2008 model year at the 2008 Consumer Electronics Show, and on 4 February 2008 Samsung removed their 30\" wide screen CRTs from their North American website and has not replaced them with new models.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/subtype/subtype.do?group=televisions&type=televisions&subtype=slimfithdtv |title=SlimFit HDTV|publisher=Samsung |accessdate=12 June 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080110164950/http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/subtype/subtype.do?group=televisions&type=televisions&subtype=slimfithdtv <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate= 10 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the demise of CRTs has been happening more slowly in the developing world. According to iSupply, production in units of CRTs was not surpassed by LCDs production until 4Q 2007, owing largely to CRT production at factories in China. In the United Kingdom, [[DSG International (retailer)|DSG (Dixons)]], the largest retailer of domestic electronic equipment, reported that CRT models made up 80\u201390% of the volume of televisions sold at Christmas 2004 and 15\u201320% a year later, and that they were expected to be less than 5% at the end of 2006. Dixons ceased selling CRT televisions in 2006.<ref>{{cite news |title=The future is flat as Dixons withdraws sale of 'big box' televisions |publisher=London Evening Standard |date= 26 November 2006 |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23376023-details/The+future+is+flat+as+Dixons+withdraws+sale+of+'big+box'+televisions/article.do |accessdate=3 December 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Causes===\nCRTs, despite recent advances, have remained relatively heavy and bulky and take up a lot of space in comparison to other display technologies. CRT screens have much deeper cabinets compared to flat panels and rear-projection displays for a given screen size, and so it becomes impractical to have CRTs larger than {{convert|40|in|cm|0}}. The CRT disadvantages became especially significant in light of rapid technological advancements in [[liquid-crystal display|LCD]] and plasma flat-panels which allow them to easily surpass {{convert|40|in|cm|0}} as well as being thin and wall-mountable, two key features that were increasingly being demanded by consumers.\n\n===Slimmer CRT===\n[[File:Tabgamb.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A comparison between 21-inch Superslim and Ultraslim CRT]]\n\nSome CRT manufacturers, both LG Display and Samsung Display, have innovated CRT technology by creating a slimmer tube. Slimmer CRT has a trade name Superslim and Ultraslim. A 21-inch flat CRT has 447.2 millimeter depth. The depth of Superslim is 352 millimeters and Ultraslim is 295.7 millimeters.\n\n==Health concerns==\n\n===Ionizing radiation===\nCRTs can emit a small amount of [[X-ray]] radiation as a result of the electron beam's bombardment of the shadow mask/aperture grille and phosphors. The amount of radiation escaping the front of the monitor is widely considered not to be harmful. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulations in {{CodeFedReg|21|1020|10}} are used to strictly limit, for instance, television receivers to 0.5 [[Roentgen (unit)|milliroentgens]] per hour (mR/h) (0.13&nbsp;\u00b5C/(kg\u00b7h) or 36&nbsp;pA/kg) at a distance of {{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=on}} from any external surface; since 2007, most CRTs have emissions that fall well below this limit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=1020.10 |title=SUBCHAPTER J\u2014RADIOLOGICAL HEALTH (21CFR1020.10) |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=1 April 2006 |accessdate=13 August 2007}}</ref>\n<br/>\n\n===Toxicity===\nOlder color and monochrome CRTs may contain toxic substances, such as [[cadmium]], in the phosphors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://takebackmytv.com/pages/toxic_tvs |title=Toxic TVs |accessdate=13 April 2010 |publisher=Electronics TakeBack Coalition |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227041627/http://takebackmytv.com/pages/toxic_tvs |archivedate=27 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://e-stewards.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/OccupationalRisksCRTGlassProcessing1.pdf |title=Occupational Risks Associated with Electronics Demanufacturing and CRT Glass Processing Operations and the Impact of Mitigation Activities on Employee Safety and Health |accessdate=20 January 2011 |author1=Peters-Michaud, Neil |author2=Katers, John |author3=Barry, Jim |format=PDF |work=Cascade Asset Management, LLC |publisher=Basel Action Network |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726012352/http://e-stewards.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/OccupationalRisksCRTGlassProcessing1.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanelements.com/cdm.html |title=Cadmium |accessdate=13 April 2010 |publisher=[[American Elements]]}}</ref> The rear glass tube of modern CRTs may be made from [[lead glass|leaded glass]], which represent an environmental hazard if disposed of improperly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hinkleycenter.com/publications/lead_leachability_99-5.pdf |title=CHARACTERIZATION OF LEAD LEACHABILITY FROM CATHODE RAY TUBES USING THE TOXICITY CHARACTERISTIC LEACHING PROCEDURE (TCLP) |accessdate=4 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222012228/http://www.hinkleycenter.com/publications/lead_leachability_99-5.pdf |archivedate=22 February 2014}}</ref> By the time personal computers were produced, glass in the front panel (the viewable portion of the CRT) used barium rather than lead,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} though the rear of the CRT was still produced from leaded glass. Monochrome CRTs typically do not contain enough leaded glass to fail EPA TCLP tests. While the TCLP process grinds the glass into fine particles in order to expose them to weak acids to test for leachate, intact CRT glass does not leache (The lead is vitrified, contained inside the glass itself, similar to leaded glass crystalware).\n\nIn October 2001, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] created rules stating that CRTs must be brought to special [[recycling]] facilities. In November 2002, the EPA began fining companies that disposed of CRTs through [[landfill]]s or [[incineration]]. Regulatory agencies, local and statewide, monitor the disposal of CRTs and other computer equipment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/recycling/electron/index.htm|title=Final Rules on Cathode Ray Tubes and Discarded Mercury-Containing Equipment|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn Europe, disposal of CRT televisions and monitors is covered by the [[WEEE Directive]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awm-group.com/recycling/WEEEandCRTProcessing.htm |title=WEEE and CRT Processing |accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Flicker===\n{{Main|Flicker (screen)}}\nAt low [[refresh rate]]s (60&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] and below), the periodic scanning of the display may produce a flicker that some people perceive more easily than others, especially when viewed with [[peripheral vision]]. Flicker is commonly associated with CRT as most televisions run at 50&nbsp;Hz (PAL) or 60&nbsp;Hz (NTSC), although there are some 100&nbsp;Hz PAL televisions that are [[flicker-free]]. Typically only low-end monitors run at such low frequencies, with most computer monitors supporting at least 75&nbsp;Hz and high-end monitors capable of 100&nbsp;Hz or more to eliminate any perception of flicker.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcmech.com/article/crt-monitor-flickering/|title=CRT Monitor Flickering?|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref> Non-computer CRTs or CRT for [[sonar]] or [[radar]] may have long [[Image persistence|persistence]] phosphor and are thus flicker free. If the persistence is too long on a video display, moving images will be blurred.\n\n===High-frequency audible noise===\n50&nbsp;Hz/60&nbsp;Hz CRTs used for television operate with horizontal scanning frequencies of 15,734&nbsp;Hz (for [[NTSC]] systems) or 15,625&nbsp;Hz (for [[PAL]] systems).<ref>{{cite book |last= Netravali |first= Arun N. |author2=Haskell, Barry G. |title= Digital pictures: representation, compression, and standards |publisher= Plenum Publishing Corporation |year= 1995 |page= 100 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=-TXYfZrCBuQC&pg=PA100 |isbn=978-0-306-44917-8}}</ref> These frequencies are at the upper range of [[human hearing]] and are inaudible to many people; however, some people (especially children) will perceive a high-pitched tone near an operating television CRT.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ts/x/comp/crt/failWhine-c.html |title=The monitor is producing a high-pitched whine |accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref> The sound is due to [[magnetostriction]] in the magnetic core and periodic movement of windings of the [[flyback transformer]].\n\nThis problem does not occur on 100/120&nbsp;Hz TVs and on non-CGA computer displays, because they use much higher horizontal scanning frequencies (22&nbsp;kHz to over 100&nbsp;kHz).\n\n===Implosion===\nHigh [[vacuum]] inside glass-walled cathode ray tubes permits electron beams to fly freely\u2014without colliding into molecules of air or other gas. If the glass is damaged, atmospheric pressure can collapse the vacuum tube into dangerous fragments which accelerate inward and then spray at high speed in all directions. The implosion energy is proportional to the evacuated volume of the CRT. Although modern cathode ray tubes used in televisions and computer displays have [[epoxy]]-bonded face-plates or other measures to prevent shattering of the envelope, CRTs must be handled carefully to avoid personal injury.<ref name=Bali>{{cite book |last= Bali |first= S.P. |title= Colour Television: Theory and Practice |publisher= Tata McGraw\u2013Hill |year= 1994 |page= 129 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=53nnX4fnnNIC&pg=PA129 |isbn=978-0-07-460024-5}}</ref>\n\n===Electric shock===\nTo accelerate the electrons from the cathode to the screen with sufficient velocity, a very [[high voltage]] (EHT or Extra High Tension) is required,<ref>Color Television Servicing Manual, Vol-1, by M.D. Aggarwala, 1985, Television for you, Delhi, India</ref> from a few thousand volts for a small oscilloscope CRT to tens of kV for a larger screen color TV.
