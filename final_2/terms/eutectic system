(''L'' denotes the liquid state.)]]\n\nA '''eutectic system''' ({{USdict|y\u00fc-'tek-tik}})<ref>{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|eutectic}}</ref> from the Greek \"\u03b5\u03c5\" (eu = easy) and \"\u03a4\u03ae\u03be\u03b9\u03c2\" (teksis = melting) describes a homogeneous [[Alloy|solid mix]] of atomic and/or chemical species, to form a joint [[superlattice|super-lattice]], by striking a unique atomic percentage ratio between the components \u2014 as each pure component has its own distinct bulk lattice arrangement.  It is only in this atomic/molecular ratio that ''the eutectic system [[melting|melts]] as a whole'', at a specific temperature (the eutectic temperature) ''the super-lattice releasing at once all its components'' into a liquid mixture.  The eutectic temperature is the lowest possible melting temperature over all of the mixing ratios for the involved component species.\n\nUpon heating any other mixture ratio, and reaching the eutectic temperature \u2014 see the [[phase diagram]] to the right \u2014 one component's lattice will melt first, while the temperature of the mixture has to further increase for (all) the other component lattice(s) to melt.   Conversely, as a non-eutectic mixture cools down, each mixture's component will solidify (form its lattice) at a distinct temperature, until all material is solid.\n\nThe coordinates defining a ''eutectic point'' on a [[phase diagram]] are the ''eutectic percentage ratio'' (on the [[Phase diagram|atomic/molecular ratio]] [[Abscissa|axis]] of the diagram) and the ''eutectic temperature'' (on the [[temperature]] [[Ordinate|axis]] of the diagram).<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|pp=326\u2013327}}</ref>\n\nNot all [[binary alloy]]s have eutectic points because the [[valence electron]]s of the component species are not always compatible,{{clarify|compatible electrons?|date=November 2014}} in any mixing ratio, to form a new type of joint crystal lattice. For example, in the silver-gold system the melt temperature ([[liquidus]]) and freeze temperature ([[solidus (chemistry)|solidus]]) \"meet at the pure element endpoints of the atomic ratio axis while slightly separating in the mixture region of this axis\".<ref>http://www.crct.polymtl.ca/fact/phase_diagram.php?file=Ag-Au.jpg&dir=SGTE</ref>\n\n==Eutectic reaction==\n[[File:Various eutectic structures.png|thumb|Four eutectic structures: A) lamellar B) rod-like C) globular D) acicular.]]\n\nThe eutectic reaction is defined as follows:<ref name=\"smith327\">{{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|p=327}}.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\text{Liquid} \\xrightarrow[\\text{cooling}]{\\text{eutectic temperature}} \\alpha \\,\\, \\text{solid solution} + \\beta \\,\\, \\text{solid solution}</math>\n\nThis type of reaction is an [[invariant reaction]], because it is in [[thermal equilibrium]]; another way to define this is the [[Gibbs free energy]] equals zero. Tangibly, this means the liquid and two [[solid solution]]s all coexist at the same time and are in [[chemical equilibrium]]. There is also a [[thermal arrest]] for the duration of the change of phase during which the temperature of the system does not change.<ref name=\"smith327\"/>\n\nThe resulting solid [[macrostructure]] from a eutectic reaction depends on a few factors. The most important factor is how the two solid solutions nucleate and grow. The most common structure is a [[lamellar structure]], but other possible structures include rodlike, globular, and [[Acicular (crystal habit)|acicular]].<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|pp=332\u2013333}}.</ref>\n\n==Non-eutectic compositions==\nCompositions of eutectic systems that are not at the eutectic composition can be classified as ''hypoeutectic'' or ''hypereutectic''. Hypoeutectic compositions are those with a smaller percent composition of species \u03b2 and a greater composition of species \u03b1 than the eutectic composition (E) while hypereutectic solutions are characterized as those with a higher composition of species \u03b2 and a lower composition of species \u03b1 than the eutectic composition. As the temperature of a non-eutectic composition is lowered the liquid mixture will precipitate one component of the mixture before the other.  In a hypereutectic solution, there will be a proeutectoid phase of species \u03b2 whereas a hypoeutectic solution will have a proeutectic \u03b1 phase.<ref name=\"smith327\"/>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Alloys===\nEutectic [[alloy]]s have two or more materials and have a eutectic composition. When a non-eutectic alloy solidifies, its components solidify at different temperatures, exhibiting a plastic melting range. Conversely, when a well-mixed, eutectic alloy melts, it does so at a single, sharp temperature. The various phase transformations that occur during the solidification of a particular alloy composition can be understood by drawing a vertical line from the liquid phase to the solid phase on the phase diagram for that alloy.\n\nSome uses include:\n*NEMA Eutectic Alloy Overload Relays for [[power-system protection|electrical protection]] of 3-phase motors for pumps, fans, conveyors, and other factory process equipment.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.industrial-electronics.com/output_devices_amplifiers_valves_relays_variable-frequency_drives_stepper_motors_servomotors/Operation_Overloads.html |title= Operation of the Overloads |accessdate= 2015-08-05 }}</ref>\n*Eutectic alloys for [[soldering]], composed of [[tin]] (Sn), [[lead]] (Pb) and sometimes [[silver]] (Ag) or [[gold]] (Au) \u2014 especially [[Solder#Solder alloys|Sn{{sub|63}}Pb{{sub|37}}]] alloy formula for electronics\n*Casting alloys, such as [[Silumin|aluminium-silicon]] and [[cast iron]] (at the composition of 4.3% carbon in iron producing an [[austenite]]-[[cementite]] eutectic)\n*[[Silicon chip]]s are bonded to gold-plated substrates through a silicon-gold eutectic by the application of [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] energy to the chip.

For instance, in the iron-carbon system, the [[austenite]] phase can undergo a eutectoid transformation to produce [[Ferrite (iron)|ferrite]] and [[cementite]], often in lamellar structures such as [[pearlite]] and [[bainite]].  This eutectoid point occurs at {{convert|727|C|abbr=on}} and about 0.76% carbon.<ref>[http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/96ClassProj/examples/kimcon.html Iron-Iron Carbide Phase Diagram Example<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Peritectoid===\nA ''peritectoid'' transformation is a type of [[isothermal]] [[reversible reaction]] that has two solid [[Phase (matter)|phase]]s reacting with each other upon cooling of a binary, ternary, ..., <math>n\\!</math>ary [[alloy]] to create a completely different and single solid phase.<ref name=\"Gold Book PAC,1994,66,588\">IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology, Electronic version.

Here, a liquid and solid phase of fixed proportions react at a fixed temperature to yield a single solid phase. Since the solid product forms at the interface between the two reactants, it can form a diffusion barrier and generally causes such reactions to proceed much more slowly than eutectic or eutectoid transformations. Because of this, when a peritectic composition solidifies it does not show the [[lamellar structure]] that is found with eutectic solidification.\n\nSuch a transformation exists in the iron-carbon system, as seen near the upper-left corner of the figure.  It resembles an inverted eutectic, with the \u03b4 phase combining with the liquid to produce pure [[austenite]] at {{convert|1495|C|abbr=on}} and 0.17% carbon.\n\n[[File:Phasendiagramm Gold-Aluminium.svg|right|300px|thumb|Gold-aluminium [[phase diagram]] (German). Top axis title reads \"Weight-percent Gold\", lower axis title reads \"Atomic-percent Gold\"]]\nAt the peritectic decomposition temperature the compound, rather than melting, decomposes into another solid compound and a liquid. The proportion of each is determined by the [[lever rule]]. In the [[Gold-aluminium intermetallic|Al-Au]] phase diagram, for example, it can be seen that only two of the phases melt congruently, [[Gold-aluminium intermetallic|AuAl<sub>2</sub>]] and [[Gold-aluminium intermetallic|Au<sub>2</sub>Al]] , while the rest peritectically decompose.\n\n==Eutectic calculation==\nThe composition and temperature of a eutectic can be calculated from enthalpy and entropy of fusion of each components.<ref>International Journal of Modern Physics C, Vol. 15, No. 5.
