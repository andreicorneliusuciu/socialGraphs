It is sometimes taken to be the point in the filter response where a [[transition band]] and passband meet, for example, as defined by a 3&nbsp;[[Decibel|dB]] corner (a frequency for which the output of the circuit is \u22123&nbsp;dB of the nominal passband value).  Alternatively, a [[stopband]] corner frequency may be specified as a point where a transition band and a stopband meet: a frequency for which the attenuation is larger than the required stopband attenuation, which for example may be 30&nbsp;dB or 100&nbsp;dB.\n\nIn the case of a [[waveguide]] or an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]], the cutoff frequencies correspond to the lower and upper '''cutoff wavelengths'''.\n\n==Electronics==\nIn [[electronics]], cutoff frequency or corner frequency is the [[frequency]] either above or below which the power output of a [[Electronic circuit|circuit]], such as a [[telephone line|line]], amplifier, or [[electronic filter]] has fallen to a given proportion of the power in the [[passband]].  Most frequently this proportion is one half the passband power, also referred to as the 3&nbsp;[[decibel|dB]] point since a fall of 3&nbsp;dB corresponds approximately to half power.  As a voltage ratio this is a fall to <math>\\scriptstyle \\sqrt{1/2} \\ \\approx \\ 0.707</math> of the passband voltage.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|title=Network Analysis\n|edition=3rd\n|last=Van Valkenburg\n|first=M.

For instance, in the case of the [[Chebyshev filter]] it is usual to define the cutoff frequency as the point after the last peak in the frequency response at which the level has fallen to the design value of the passband ripple.  The amount of ripple in this class of filter can be set by the designer to any desired value, hence the ratio used could be any value.<ref>Mathaei, Young, Jones ''Microwave Filters, Impedance-Matching Networks, and Coupling Structures'', pp.85-86, McGraw-Hill 1964.</ref>\n\n==Communications==\nIn [[Telecommunication|communications]], the term cutoff frequency can mean the frequency below which a [[radio wave]] fails to penetrate a layer of the [[ionosphere]] at the incidence angle required for [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] between two specified points by [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] from the layer.\n\n==Waveguides==\nThe cutoff frequency of an [[waveguide (electromagnetism)|electromagnetic waveguide]] is the lowest frequency for which a mode will propagate in it. In [[fiber optics]], it is more common to consider the '''cutoff wavelength''', the maximum [[wavelength]] that will propagate in an [[optical fiber]] or [[Waveguide (optics)|waveguide]]. The cutoff frequency is found with the [[Characteristic equation (calculus)|characteristic equation]] of the [[Helmholtz equation]] for electromagnetic waves, which is derived from the [[electromagnetic wave equation]] by setting the longitudinal [[wave number]] equal to zero and solving for the frequency.  Thus, any exciting frequency lower than the cutoff frequency will attenuate, rather than propagate.  The following derivation assumes lossless walls.  The value of c, the [[speed of light]], should be taken to be the [[group velocity]] of light in whatever material fills the waveguide.\n\nFor a rectangular waveguide, the cutoff frequency is\n:<math>\n  \\omega_{c} = c \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{n \\pi}{a}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{m \\pi}{b}\\right) ^2}, \n</math>\nwhere the integers <math>n,m \\ge 0</math> are the mode numbers, and ''a'' and ''b'' the lengths of the sides of the rectangle. For TE modes, <math> n,m \\ge 0</math> (but <math> n = m = 0</math> is not allowed), while for TM modes <math> n, m \\ge 1 </math>.\n\nThe cutoff frequency of the TM<sub>01</sub> mode (next higher from dominant mode TE<sub>11</sub>) in a waveguide of circular cross-section (the transverse-magnetic mode with no angular dependence and lowest radial dependence) is given by \n:<math>\n  \\omega_{c} = c \\frac{\\chi_{01}}{r} = c \\frac{2.4048}{r},\n</math>\nwhere <math>r</math> is the radius of the waveguide, and  <math>\\chi_{01}</math> is the first root of <math>J_{0}(r)</math>, the [[bessel function]] of the first kind of order 1.\n\nThe dominant mode TE<sub>11</sub> cutoff frequency is given by\n:<math>\n  \\omega_{c} = c \\frac{\\chi_{11}}{r} = c \\frac{1.8412}{r}\n</math><ref>I.

Hunter, ''Theory and Design of Microwave Filters'', p.214 IET, 2001 ISBN 0-85296-777-2.</ref>\n\nFor a [[single-mode optical fiber]], the cutoff wavelength is the wavelength at which the [[normalized frequency (fiber optics)|normalized frequency]] is approximately equal to 2.405.\n\n===Mathematical analysis===\nThe starting point is the wave equation (which is derived from the [[Maxwell equations]]),\n:<math>\n  \\left(\\nabla^2-\\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial{t}^2}\\right)\\psi(\\mathbf{r},t)=0,\n</math>\nwhich becomes a [[Helmholtz equation]] by considering only functions of the form \n:<math>\n  \\psi(x,y,z,t) = \\psi(x,y,z)e^{i \\omega t}.\n</math>\nSubstituting and evaluating the time derivative gives\n:<math>\n  (\\nabla^2 + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2}) \\psi(x,y,z) = 0.\n</math>\nThe function <math> \\psi </math> here refers to whichever field (the electric field or the magnetic field) has no vector component in the longitudinal direction - the \"transverse\" field.  It is a property of all the eigenmodes of the electromagnetic waveguide that at least one of the two fields is transverse. The ''z'' axis is defined to be along the axis of the waveguide.\n\nThe \"longitudinal\" derivative in the [[Laplacian]] can further be reduced by considering only functions of the form \n:<math>\n  \\psi(x,y,z,t) = \\psi(x,y)e^{i \\left(\\omega t - k_{z} z \\right)},\n</math>\nwhere <math>k_z</math> is the longitudinal [[wavenumber]], resulting in\n:<math>\n  (\\nabla_{T}^2 - k_{z}^2 + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2}) \\psi(x,y,z) = 0,\n</math>\nwhere subscript T indicates a 2-dimensional transverse Laplacian.  The final step depends on the geometry of the waveguide.  The easiest geometry to solve is the rectangular waveguide.  In that case the remainder of the Laplacian can be evaluated to its characteristic equation by considering solutions of the form \n:<math>\n  \\psi(x,y,z,t) = \\psi_{0}e^{i \\left(\\omega t - k_{z} z - k_{x} x - k_{y} y\\right)}.\n</math>\nThus for the rectangular guide the Laplacian is evaluated, and we arrive at\n:<math>\n  \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} = k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2\n</math>\nThe transverse wavenumbers can be specified from the standing wave boundary conditions for a rectangular geometry crossection with dimensions ''a'' and ''b'':\n:<math>\n  k_{x} = \\frac{n \\pi}{a},\n</math>\n:<math>\n  k_{y} = \\frac{m \\pi}{b},\n</math>\nwhere ''n'' and ''m'' are the two integers representing a specific eigenmode.  Performing the final substitution, we obtain\n:<math>\n  \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2} = \\left(\\frac{n \\pi}{a}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{m \\pi}{b}\\right)^2 + k_{z}^2,\n</math>\nwhich is the [[dispersion relation]] in the rectangular waveguide. The cutoff frequency <math>\\omega_{c}</math> is the critical frequency between propagation and attenuation, which corresponds to the frequency at which the longitudinal wavenumber <math>k_{z}</math> is zero. It is given by\n:<math>\n  \\omega_{c} = c \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{n \\pi}{a}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{m \\pi}{b}\\right)^2}\n</math>\nThe wave equations are also valid below the cutoff frequency, where the longitudinal wave number is imaginary. In this case, the field decays exponentially along the waveguide axis and the wave is thus [[Evanescent wave|evanescent]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Angular frequency]]\n*[[Spatial cutoff frequency]] (in optical systems)\n*[[Full width at half maximum]]\n*[[High-pass filter]]\n*[[Low-pass filter]]\n*[[Time constant]]\n*[[Miller effect]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{FS1037C MS188}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-geommean.htm Calculation of the center frequency with geometric mean and comparison to the arithmetic mean solution]\n*[http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-timeconstant.htm Conversion of cutoff frequency f<sub>c</sub> and time constant \u03c4]\n*[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BesselFunction.html Mathematical definition of and information about the Bessel functions]\n\n[[Category:Filter theory]]"}]}}}}
