It was discovered by Dutch physicist [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] on April&nbsp;8, 1911 in [[Leiden]]. Like [[ferromagnetism]] and [[atomic spectral line]]s, superconductivity is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] phenomenon. It is characterized by the [[Meissner effect]], the complete ejection of [[magnetic field|magnetic field lines]] from the interior of the superconductor as it transitions into the superconducting state. The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the [[idealization]] of ''[[perfect conductor|perfect conductivity]]'' in [[classical physics]].\n\nThe electrical resistance of a metallic [[electrical conductor|conductor]] decreases gradually as temperature is lowered. In ordinary conductors, such as [[copper]] or [[silver]], this decrease is limited by impurities and other defects. Even near [[absolute zero]], a real sample of a normal conductor shows some resistance. In a superconductor, the resistance drops abruptly to zero when the material is cooled below its critical temperature. An [[electric current]] flowing through a loop of [[superconducting wire]] can persist indefinitely with no power source.<ref name=\"\">{{cite journal\n  | author =John Bardeen\n  | author2 = Leon Cooper\n  | author3 = J.

[[Liquid nitrogen]] boils at 77&nbsp;K, and superconduction at higher temperatures than this facilitates many experiments and applications that are less practical at lower temperatures.\n\n==Classification==\n{{Main article|Superconductor classification}}\nThere are many criteria by which superconductors are classified. The most common are:\n*'''Response to a magnetic field''': A superconductor can be ''[[Type I superconductor|Type&nbsp;I]]'', meaning it has a single critical field, above which all superconductivity is lost; or ''[[Type II superconductor|Type&nbsp;II]]'', meaning it has two critical fields, between which it allows partial penetration of the magnetic field.\n*'''By theory of operation''': It is ''[[conventional superconductor|conventional]]'' if it can be explained by the [[BCS theory]] or its derivatives, or ''[[unconventional superconductor|unconventional]]'', otherwise.\n*'''By critical temperature''': A superconductor is generally considered ''[[high temperature superconductivity|high temperature]]'' if it reaches a superconducting state when cooled using [[liquid nitrogen]] \u2013 that is, at only ''T<sub>c</sub>''&nbsp;> 77&nbsp;K) \u2013 or ''low temperature'' if more aggressive cooling techniques are required to reach its critical temperature.\n*'''By material''': Superconductor material classes include [[chemical element]]s (e.g. [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[lead]]), [[alloy]]s (such as [[niobium-titanium]], [[germanium-niobium]], and [[niobium nitride]]), [[ceramic]]s ([[YBCO]] and [[magnesium diboride]]), [[Iron-based superconductor|superconducting pnictides]] (like fluorine-doped LaOFeAs) or [[organic superconductor]]s ([[fullerene]]s and [[carbon nanotube]]s; though perhaps these examples should be included among the chemical elements, as they are composed entirely of [[carbon]]).\n\n==Elementary properties of superconductors==\nMost of the physical properties of superconductors vary from material to material, such as the [[heat capacity]] and the critical temperature, critical field, and critical current density at which superconductivity is destroyed.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a class of properties that are independent of the underlying material. For instance, all superconductors have ''exactly'' zero resistivity to low applied currents when there is no magnetic field present or if the applied field does not exceed a critical value. The existence of these \"universal\" properties implies that superconductivity is a [[phase (matter)|thermodynamic phase]], and thus possesses certain distinguishing properties which are largely independent of microscopic details.\n\n===Zero electrical DC resistance===\n[[File:CERN-cables-p1030764.jpg|thumb|Electric cables for accelerators at [[CERN]]. Both the massive and slim cables are rated for 12,500 [[amperes|A]]. ''Top:'' conventional cables for [[LEP]]; ''bottom:'' superconductor-based cables for the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]]]]\n[[File:Cross section of preform superconductor cable.jpg|thumb|Cross section of a preform superconductor rod from abandoned [[Superconducting Super Collider|Texas Superconducting Super Collider (SSC)]].]]\nThe simplest method to measure the [[electrical resistance]] of a sample of some material is to place it in an [[electrical circuit]] in series with a [[current source]] ''I'' and measure the resulting [[voltage]] ''V'' across the sample. The resistance of the sample is given by [[Ohm's law]] as ''R&nbsp;=&nbsp;V&nbsp;/&nbsp;I''. If the voltage is zero, this means that the resistance is zero.\n\nSuperconductors are also able to maintain a current with no applied voltage whatsoever, a property exploited in [[Superconducting magnet|superconducting electromagnet]]s such as those found in [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] machines. Experiments have demonstrated that currents in superconducting coils can persist for years without any measurable degradation. Experimental evidence points to a current lifetime of at least 100,000 years. Theoretical estimates for the lifetime of a persistent current can exceed the estimated lifetime of the [[universe]], depending on the wire geometry and the temperature.<ref name=\"Gallop\"/>\n\nIn a normal conductor, an electric current may be visualized as a fluid of [[electron]]s moving across a heavy [[ion]]ic lattice. The electrons are constantly colliding with the ions in the lattice, and during each collision some of the [[energy]] carried by the current is absorbed by the lattice and converted into [[heat]], which is essentially the vibrational [[kinetic energy]] of the lattice ions. As a result, the energy carried by the current is constantly being dissipated. This is the phenomenon of electrical resistance and [[Joule heating]].\n\nThe situation is different in a superconductor. In a conventional superconductor, the electronic fluid cannot be resolved into individual electrons. Instead, it consists of bound ''pairs'' of electrons known as [[Cooper pair]]s. This pairing is caused by an attractive force between electrons from the exchange of [[phonon]]s. Due to [[quantum mechanics]], the [[energy spectrum]] of this Cooper pair fluid possesses an ''[[energy gap]]'', meaning there is a minimum amount of energy \u0394''E'' that must be supplied in order to excite the fluid. Therefore, if \u0394''E'' is larger than the [[thermal energy]] of the lattice, given by ''kT'', where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]] and ''T'' is the [[temperature]], the fluid will not be scattered by the lattice. The Cooper pair fluid is thus a [[superfluid]], meaning it can flow without energy dissipation.\n\nIn a class of superconductors known as [[type II superconductor]]s, including all known [[high-temperature superconductor]]s, an extremely small amount of resistivity appears at temperatures not too far below the nominal superconducting transition when an electric current is applied in conjunction with a strong magnetic field, which may be caused by the electric current. This is due to the motion of [[Abrikosov vortex|magnetic vortices]] in the electronic superfluid, which dissipates some of the energy carried by the current. If the current is sufficiently small, the vortices are stationary, and the resistivity vanishes. The resistance due to this effect is tiny compared with that of non-superconducting materials, but must be taken into account in sensitive experiments. However, as the temperature decreases far enough below the nominal superconducting transition, these vortices can become frozen into a disordered but stationary phase known as a \"vortex glass\". Below this vortex glass transition temperature, the resistance of the material becomes truly zero.\n\n===Superconducting phase transition {{anchor|Superconducting phase transition}}===\n[[File:Cvandrhovst.png|thumb|400px|Behavior of heat capacity (c<sub>v</sub>, blue) and resistivity (\u03c1, green) at the superconducting phase transition]]\n\nIn superconducting materials, the characteristics of superconductivity appear when the [[temperature]] ''T'' is lowered below a '''critical temperature''' ''T<sub>c</sub>''. The value of this critical temperature varies from material to material. Conventional superconductors usually have critical temperatures ranging from around 20&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] to less than 1&nbsp;K. Solid [[mercury (element)|mercury]], for example, has a critical temperature of 4.2&nbsp;K. {{As of|2009}}, the highest critical temperature found for a conventional superconductor is 39 K for [[magnesium diboride]] (MgB<sub>2</sub>),<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |display-authors = 4\n |author = Jun Nagamatsu\n |author2 = Norimasa Nakagawa\n |author3 = Takahiro Muranaka\n |author4 = Yuji Zenitani\n |author5 = Jun Akimitsu\n |last-author-amp = yes\n |date = 2001\n |title = Superconductivity at 39 K in magnesium diboride\n |journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]\n |volume = 410 |issue = 6824 |pages = 63\u20134\n |doi = 10.1038/35065039\n |pmid = 11242039\n|bibcode = 2001Natur.410...63N }}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n |author=Paul Preuss\n |date=14 August 2002\n |title=A most unusual superconductor and how it works: first-principles calculation explains the strange behavior of magnesium diboride\n |url =http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/MSD-superconductor-Cohen-Louie.html\n |work =Research News\n |publisher=[[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]\n |accessdate = 2009-10-28\n}}</ref> although this material displays enough exotic properties that there is some doubt about classifying it as a \"conventional\" superconductor.<ref>\n{{cite news\n |author=Hamish Johnston\n |date=17 February 2009\n |title=Type-1.5 superconductor shows its stripes\n |url =http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/37806\n |work =[[Physics World]]\n |publisher=[[Institute of Physics]]\n |accessdate = 2009-10-28\n}}</ref> [[Cuprate]] superconductors can have much higher critical temperatures: [[YBCO|YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>]], one of the first cuprate superconductors to be discovered, has a critical temperature of 92&nbsp;K, and mercury-based cuprates have been found with critical temperatures in excess of 130&nbsp;K. The explanation for these high critical temperatures remains unknown. Electron pairing due to [[phonon]] exchanges explains superconductivity in conventional superconductors, but it does not explain superconductivity in the newer superconductors that have a very high critical temperature.\n\nSimilarly, at a fixed temperature below the critical temperature, superconducting materials cease to superconduct when an external [[magnetic field]] is applied which is greater than the ''critical magnetic field''. This is because the [[Gibbs free energy]] of the superconducting phase increases quadratically with the magnetic field while the free energy of the normal phase is roughly independent of the magnetic field. If the material superconducts in the absence of a field, then the superconducting phase free energy is lower than that of the normal phase and so for some finite value of the magnetic field (proportional to the square root of the difference of the free energies at zero magnetic field) the two free energies will be equal and a phase transition to the normal phase will occur. More generally, a higher temperature and a stronger magnetic field lead to a smaller fraction of the electrons in the superconducting band and consequently a longer [[London penetration depth]] of external magnetic fields and currents. The penetration depth becomes infinite at the phase transition.\n\nThe onset of superconductivity is accompanied by abrupt changes in various physical properties, which is the hallmark of a [[phase transition]]. For example, the electronic [[heat capacity]] is proportional to the temperature in the normal (non-superconducting) regime. At the superconducting transition, it suffers a discontinuous jump and thereafter ceases to be linear. At low temperatures, it varies instead as ''e''<sup>\u2212\u03b1/''T''</sup> for some constant, \u03b1. This exponential behavior is one of the pieces of evidence for the existence of the [[energy gap]].\n\nThe [[Second-order transition|order]] of the superconducting phase transition was long a matter of debate. Experiments indicate that the transition is second-order, meaning there is no [[latent heat]]. However, in the presence of an external magnetic field there is latent heat, because the superconducting phase has a lower entropy below the critical temperature than the normal phase. It has been experimentally demonstrated<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author = R. L.

In the 1980s it was shown theoretically with the help of a [[disorder field|disorder field theory]], in which the [[vortex line]]s of the superconductor play a major role, that the transition is of second order within the [[Type II superconductor|type II]] regime and of first order (i.e., [[latent heat]]) within the [[Type I superconductor|type I]] regime, and that the two regions are separated by a [[tricritical point]].<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | author = H.

The Meissner effect does not cause the field to be completely ejected but instead the field penetrates the superconductor but only to a very small distance, characterized by a parameter&nbsp;''\u03bb'', called the [[London penetration depth]], decaying exponentially to zero within the bulk of the material. The [[Meissner effect]] is a defining characteristic of superconductivity. For most superconductors, the London penetration depth is on the order of 100&nbsp;nm.\n\nThe Meissner effect is sometimes confused with the kind of [[diamagnetism]] one would expect in a perfect electrical conductor: according to [[Lenz's law]], when a ''changing'' magnetic field is applied to a conductor, it will induce an electric current in the conductor that creates an opposing magnetic field. In a perfect conductor, an arbitrarily large current can be induced, and the resulting magnetic field exactly cancels the applied field.\n\nThe Meissner effect is distinct from this\u2014it is the spontaneous expulsion which occurs during transition to superconductivity. Suppose we have a material in its normal state, containing a constant internal magnetic field. When the material is cooled below the critical temperature, we would observe the abrupt expulsion of the internal magnetic field, which we would not expect based on Lenz's law.\n\nThe Meissner effect was given a phenomenological explanation by the brothers [[Fritz London|Fritz]] and [[Heinz London]], who showed that the electromagnetic [[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] in a superconductor is minimized provided\n\n:<math> \\nabla^2\\mathbf{H} = \\lambda^{-2} \\mathbf{H}\\, </math>\n\nwhere '''H''' is the magnetic field and \u03bb is the [[London penetration depth]].\n\nThis equation, which is known as the [[London equation]], predicts that the magnetic field in a superconductor [[exponential decay|decays exponentially]] from whatever value it possesses at the surface.\n\nA superconductor with little or no magnetic field within it is said to be in the Meissner state. The Meissner state breaks down when the applied magnetic field is too large. Superconductors can be divided into two classes according to how this breakdown occurs. In [[Type I superconductor]]s, superconductivity is abruptly destroyed when the strength of the applied field rises above a critical value ''H<sub>c</sub>''.

At a second critical field strength ''H''<sub>''c''2</sub>, superconductivity is destroyed. The mixed state is actually caused by vortices in the electronic superfluid, sometimes called [[fluxon]]s because the flux carried by these vortices is [[quantum|quantized]].

The effect, the [[London moment]], was put to good use in [[Gravity Probe B|Gravity Probe&nbsp;B]]. This experiment measured the magnetic fields of four superconducting gyroscopes to determine their spin axes.

The four-dimensional extension of the Ginzburg-Landau theory, the [[Coleman-Weinberg potential|Coleman-Weinberg model]], is important in [[quantum field theory]] and [[cosmology]].\n\nAlso in 1950, Maxwell and Reynolds ''et al.'' found that the critical temperature of a superconductor depends on the [[isotope|isotopic mass]] of the constituent [[chemical element|element]].<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author = E.
