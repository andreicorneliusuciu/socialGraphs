The term ''[[vibration]]'' is precisely used to describe mechanical oscillation. Familiar examples of oscillation include a swinging [[pendulum]] and [[alternating current]] power.\n\nOscillations occur not only in mechanical systems but also in [[dynamic system]]s in virtually every area of science: for example the beating [[human heart]], [[business cycle]]s in [[economics]], [[predator\u2013prey]] population cycles in [[ecology]], geothermal [[geyser]]s in [[geology]], vibrating strings in [[musical instrument]]s, periodic firing of [[nerve cell]]s in the brain, and the periodic swelling of [[Cepheid variable]] stars in [[astronomy]].\n\n==Simple harmonic oscillator==\n{{Main|Simple harmonic motion}}\n\nThe simplest mechanical oscillating system is a [[weight]] attached to a [[linear]] [[spring (device)|spring]] subject to only [[weight]] and [[Tension (physics)|tension]].  Such a system may be approximated on an air table or ice surface.  The system is in an [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] state when the spring is static. If the system is displaced from the equilibrium, there is a net ''restoring force'' on the mass, tending to bring it back to equilibrium.  However, in moving the mass back to the equilibrium position, it has acquired [[momentum]] which keeps it moving beyond that position, establishing a new restoring force in the opposite sense.  If a constant [[force]] such as [[gravity]] is added to the system, the point of equilibrium is shifted.  The time taken for an oscillation to occur is often referred to as the oscillatory ''period''.\n\nSystems where the restoring force on a body is directly proportional to its displacement, such as the [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of the spring-mass system, are described mathematically by the [[Harmonic oscillator#Simple harmonic oscillator|simple harmonic oscillator]] and the regular [[period (physics)|periodic]] motion is known as [[simple harmonic motion]].  In the spring-mass system, oscillations occur because, at the [[statics|static]] equilibrium displacement, the mass has [[kinetic energy]] which is converted into [[potential energy]] stored in the spring at the extremes of its path.  The spring-mass system illustrates some common features of oscillation, namely the existence of an equilibrium and the presence of a restoring force which grows stronger the further the system deviates from equilibrium.\n\n==Damped and driven oscillations==\n{{Main|Harmonic oscillator}}\n\nAll real-world oscillator systems are [[Thermodynamic reversibility|thermodynamically irreversible]].  This means there are dissipative processes such as [[friction]] or [[electrical resistance]] which continually convert some of the energy stored in the oscillator into heat in the environment.  This is called damping.  Thus, oscillations tend to decay with time unless there is some net source of energy into the system. The simplest description of this decay process can be illustrated by oscillation decay of the harmonic oscillator.\n\n{{see also|Anti-vibration compound}}\n\nIn addition, an oscillating system may be subject to some external force, as when an AC [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] is connected to an outside power source.  In this case the oscillation is said to be ''[[driven oscillations|driven]]''.\n\nSome systems can be excited by energy transfer from the environment.  This transfer typically occurs where systems are embedded in some [[fluid]] flow.  For example, the phenomenon of [[Aeroelastic flutter|flutter]] in [[aerodynamics]] occurs when an arbitrarily small displacement of an [[aircraft]] [[wing]] (from its equilibrium) results in an increase in the [[angle of attack]] of the wing on the air flow and a consequential increase in [[coefficient of lift|lift coefficient]], leading to a still greater displacement.  At sufficiently large displacements, the [[stiffness]] of the wing dominates to provide the restoring force that enables an oscillation.\n\n==Coupled oscillations==\n[[File:Coupled oscillators.gif|frame|right|Two pendulums with the same period fixed on a string act as pair of coupled oscillators. The oscillation alternates between the two.]]\n[[File:Huygens synchronization of two clocks (Experiment).jpg|thumbnail|left|100px|Experimental Setup of Huygens synchronization of two clocks]]\nThe harmonic oscillator and the systems it models have a single [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]].  More complicated systems have more degrees of freedom, for example two masses and three springs (each mass being attached to fixed points and to each other).  In such cases, the behavior of each variable influences that of the others.  This leads to a ''coupling'' of the oscillations of the individual degrees of freedom.  For example, two pendulum clocks (of identical frequency) mounted on a common wall will tend to synchronise. This [[odd sympathy|phenomenon]] was first observed by [[Christiaan Huygens]] in 1665.<ref>Strogatz, Steven. ''Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order''. Hyperion, 2003, pp 106-109</ref>  The apparent motions of the compound oscillations typically appears very complicated but a more economic, computationally simpler and conceptually deeper description is given by resolving the motion into [[normal mode]]s.\n\nMore special cases are the coupled oscillators where energy alternates between two forms of oscillation. Well-known is the [[Wilberforce pendulum]], where the oscillation alternates between an elongation of a vertical spring and the rotation of an object at the end of that spring.\n\n==Continuous systems&nbsp;&ndash; waves==\n{{main|Wave}}\nAs the number of degrees of freedom becomes arbitrarily large, a system approaches [[continuum mechanics|continuity]]; examples include a string or the surface of a body of [[water]]. Such systems have (in the [[classical limit]]) an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of normal modes and their oscillations occur in the form of waves that can characteristically propagate.\n\n==Mathematics==\n{{main|Mathematics of oscillation}}\n[[File:LimSup.svg|right|thumb|300px|Oscillation of a sequence (shown in blue) is the difference between the limit superior and limit inferior of the sequence.]]\nThe mathematics of oscillation deals with the quantification of the amount that a sequence or function tends to move between extremes.  There are several related notions: oscillation of a [[sequence]] of [[real number]]s, oscillation of a real valued [[function (mathematics)|function]] at a point, and oscillation of a function on an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] (or [[open set]]).\n\n{{-}}\n==Examples==\n{{MultiCol}}\n\n===Mechanical===\n*[[Double pendulum]]\n*[[Foucault pendulum]]\n*[[Helmholtz resonance|Helmholtz resonator]]\n*Oscillations in the Sun ([[helioseismology]]), stars ([[asteroseismology]]) and [[Neutron-star oscillations]]. \n*[[Quantum harmonic oscillator]]\n*[[swing (seat)|Playground swing]]\n*[[String instrument]]s\n*[[Torsional vibration]]\n*[[Tuning fork]]\n*[[Vibrating string]]\n*[[Wilberforce pendulum]]\n*[[Lever escapement]]\n\n===Electrical===\n{{Main|Electronic oscillator}}\n*[[Alternating current]]\n*[[Armstrong oscillator|Armstrong (or Tickler or Meissner) oscillator]]\n*[[Astable|Astable multivibrator]]\n*[[Blocking oscillator]]\n*[[Butler oscillator]]\n*[[Clapp oscillator]]\n*[[Colpitts oscillator]]\n*[[Delay line oscillator]]\n*[[Dow oscillator|Dow (or ultra-audion) oscillator]]\n*[[Electronic oscillator]]\n*[[Extended interaction oscillator]]\n*[[Hartley oscillator]]\n*[[Oscillistor]]\n*[[Phase-shift oscillator]]\n*[[Pierce oscillator]]\n*[[Relaxation oscillator]]\n*[[RLC circuit]]\n*[[Royer oscillator]]\n*[[Va\u010dk\u00e1\u0159 oscillator]]\n*[[Wien bridge oscillator]]\n{{ColBreak}}\n\n===Electro-mechanical===\n*[[Crystal oscillator]]\n\n===Optical===\n*[[Laser]] (oscillation of [[electromagnetic field]] with frequency of order 10<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Hz)\n*[[Oscillator Toda]] or [[self-pulsation]]  (pulsation of output power of [[laser]] at frequencies 10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Hz &ndash; 10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Hz in the transient regime)\n*[[Quantum oscillator]] may refer to an optical [[local oscillator]], as well as to a usual model in [[quantum optics]].\n\n===Biological===\n*[[Circadian rhythm]]\n*[[Circadian oscillator]]\n*[[Lotka\u2013Volterra equation]]\n*[[Neural oscillation]]\n*[[Oscillating gene]]\n*[[Segmentation oscillator]]\n\n===Human===\n*[[Neural oscillation]]\n*[[Insulin release oscillations]]\n*[[Puberty#Endocrine_perspective|gonadotropin releasing hormone pulsations]]\n*[[Pilot-induced oscillation]]\n*[[Voice production]]\n{{ColBreak}}\n\n===Economic and social===\n*[[Business cycle]]\n*[[Generation gap]]\n*[[Malthusian]] economics\n*[[News cycle]]\n\n===Climate and geophysics===\n*[[Atlantic multidecadal oscillation]]\n*[[Chandler wobble]]\n*[[Climate oscillation]]\n*[[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation]]\n*[[Pacific decadal oscillation]]\n*[[Quasi-biennial oscillation]]\n\n===Astrophysics===\n*[[Neutron-star oscillations|Neutron stars]]\n*[[Cyclic Model]]\n\n===Quantum mechanical===\n*[[Neutrino oscillation]]s\n*[[Quantum harmonic oscillator]]\n\n===Chemical===\n*[[Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction]]\n*[[Mercury beating heart]]\n* [[Briggs\u2013Rauscher reaction]]\n* [[Bray\u2013Liebhafsky reaction]]\n{{EndMultiCol}}\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin||22em}}\n*[[Antiresonance]]\n*[[Beat (acoustics)]]\n*[[BIBO stability]]\n*[[Critical speed]]\n*[[Cycle (music)]]\n*[[Dynamical system]]\n*[[Earthquake engineering]]\n*[[Feedback]]\n*[[Frequency]]\n*[[Oscillator phase noise]]\n*[[Periodic function]]\n*[[Phase noise]]\n*[[Reciprocating motion]]\n*[[Resonator]]\n*[[Rhythm]]\n*[[Seasonality]]\n*[[Self-oscillation]]\n*[[Hidden oscillation]]\n*[[Signal generator]]\n*[[Squegging]]\n*[[Strange attractor]]\n*[[Structural stability]]\n*[[Tuned mass damper]]\n*[[Vibration]]\n*[[Vibrator (mechanical)]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{wiktionary}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/3vw/ch01/ch01.html Vibrations]&nbsp;&ndash; a chapter from an online textbook\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Oscillation| ]]\n[[Category:Earthquake engineering]]"}]}}}}
