As in ramjets, a scramjet relies on high vehicle speed to forcefully compress the incoming air before combustion (hence ''ram''jet), but a ramjet decelerates the air to [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] velocities before combustion, while airflow in a scramjet is supersonic throughout the entire engine.  This allows the scramjet to operate efficiently at extremely high speeds.\n\n==History==\n\n===Before year 2000===\nDuring [[World War II]], a tremendous amount of time and effort were put into researching high-speed [[jet aircraft|jet-]] and [[rocket-powered aircraft]], predominantly by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} After the war, the US and UK took in several German scientists and military technologies through [[Operation Paperclip]] to begin putting more emphasis on their own weapons development, including jet engines.  The [[Bell X-1]] attained [[Supersonic speed#Supersonic flight|supersonic flight]] in 1947 and, by the early 1960s, rapid progress towards faster [[aircraft]] suggested that operational aircraft would be flying at \"hypersonic\" speeds within a few years. Except for specialized rocket research vehicles like the [[North American X-15]] and other rocket-powered [[spacecraft]], aircraft top speeds have remained level, generally in the range of Mach 1 to Mach 3.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s a variety of experimental scramjet engines were built and ground tested in the US and the UK. In 1958, an analytical paper discussed the merits and disadvantages of supersonic combustion ramjets.<ref name=\"weber\">{{cite web|last1=Weber|first1=Richard J.|last2=Mackay|first2=John S.|title=An Analysis of Ramjet Engines Using Supersonic Combustion|url=http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19930085282&hterms=weber+mackay&qs=N%3D0%26Ntk%3DAll%26Ntt%3Dweber%2520mackay%26Ntx%3Dmode%2520matchallpartial%26Nm%3D123%7CCollection%7CNASA%2520STI%7C%7C17%7CCollection%7CNACA|website=ntrs.nasa.gov|publisher=NASA Scientific and Technical Information|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref>  In 1964, Dr. [[Frederick S.

Similar to conventional jet engines, scramjet-powered aircraft carry the fuel on board, and obtain the oxidizer by the ingestion of atmospheric oxygen (as compared to [[rockets]], which carry both fuel and an [[oxidizing agent]]).  This requirement limits scramjets to suborbital atmospheric propulsion, where the oxygen content of the air is sufficient to maintain combustion.\n\nThe scramjet is composed of three basic components: a converging inlet, where incoming air is compressed; a combustor, where gaseous fuel is burned with atmospheric [[oxygen]] to produce heat; and a diverging nozzle, where the heated air is accelerated to produce [[thrust]].  Unlike a typical jet engine, such as a [[turbojet]] or [[turbofan]] engine, a scramjet does not use rotating, fan-like components to compress the air; rather, the achievable speed of the aircraft moving through the atmosphere causes the air to compress within the inlet.  As such, no [[moving parts]] are needed in a scramjet.  In comparison, typical turbojet engines require inlet fans, multiple stages of rotating [[axial-flow compressor|compressor fans]], and multiple rotating [[turbine]] stages, all of which add weight, complexity, and a greater number of failure points to the engine.\n\nDue to the nature of their design, scramjet operation is limited to near-[[hypersonic]] velocities.  As they lack mechanical compressors, scramjets require the high [[kinetic energy]] of a hypersonic flow to compress the incoming air to operational conditions.  Thus, a scramjet-powered vehicle must be accelerated to the required velocity (usually about Mach 4) by some other means of propulsion, such as turbojet, [[railgun]], or rocket engines.{{sfn |Segal|2009| pp=1}}  In the flight of the experimental scramjet-powered [[Boeing X-51A]], the test craft was lifted to flight altitude by a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] before being released and accelerated by a detachable rocket to near Mach 4.5.<ref name=\"PWR-2010-05-26\">{{cite press release |url=http://www.pw.utc.com/Media+Center/Press+Releases/Pratt+&+Whitney+Rocketdyne+Scramjet+Powers+Historic+First+Flight+of+X-51A+WaveRider |title=Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne Scramjet Powers Historic First Flight of X-51A WaveRider |last=Colaguori |first=Nancy |last2=Kidder |first2=Brian |location=[[West Palm Beach, Florida]] |publisher=[[Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne]] |date=2010-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101213232/http://www.pw.utc.com/Media+Center/Press+Releases/Pratt+&+Whitney+Rocketdyne+Scramjet+Powers+Historic+First+Flight+of+X-51A+WaveRider |archivedate=2011-01-01 |accessdate=2016-02-12 }}</ref> In May 2013, another flight achieved an increased speed of Mach 5.1.<ref name=\"Phys 2013-05-03\">{{cite news |url=http://phys.org/news/2013-05-experimental-air-aircraft-hypersonic.html |title=Experimental Air Force aircraft goes hypersonic |work=[[Phys.org]] |publisher=Omicron Technology Limited |date=2013-05-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212173726/http://phys.org/news/2013-05-experimental-air-aircraft-hypersonic.html |archivedate=2016-02-12 |accessdate=2016-02-12 }}</ref>\n\nWhile scramjets are conceptually simple, actual implementation is limited by extreme technical challenges.  Hypersonic flight within the atmosphere generates immense drag, and temperatures found on the aircraft and within the engine can be much greater than that of the surrounding air.  Maintaining combustion in the supersonic flow presents additional challenges, as the fuel must be injected, mixed, ignited, and burned within milliseconds.  While scramjet technology has been under development since the 1950s, only very recently have scramjets successfully achieved powered flight.{{sfn |Segal|2009| pp=3&ndash;11}}\n\n[[File:Turbo ram scramjet comparative diagram.svg|alt=A [[comparative diagram]] of the different geometries for the compression, combustion, and expansion sections of a turbojet, a ramjet, and a scramjet. |thumb| The compression, combustion, and expansion regions of: (a) turbojet, (b) ramjet, and (c) scramjet engines.]]\n\n=== Basic principles ===\nScramjets are designed to operate in the hypersonic flight regime, beyond the reach of turbojet engines, and, along with ramjets, fill the gap between the high efficiency of turbojets and the high speed of rocket engines.  Turbomachinery-based engines, while highly efficient at subsonic speeds, become increasingly inefficient at transonic speeds, as the compressor fans found in turbojet engines require subsonic speeds to operate.  While the flow from transonic to low supersonic speeds can be decelerated to these conditions, doing so at supersonic speeds results in a tremendous increase in temperature and a loss in the total [[pressure]] of the flow.  Around Mach 3&ndash;4, turbomachinery is no longer useful, and ram-style compression becomes the preferred method.{{sfn |Hill|Peterson|1992| pp=21}}\n\nRamjets utilize high-speed characteristics of air to literally 'ram' air through an inlet diffuser into the combustor.  At transonic and supersonic flight speeds, the air upstream of the inlet is not able to move out of the way quickly enough, and is compressed within the diffuser before being diffused into the combustor.  Combustion in a ramjet takes place at subsonic velocities, similar to turbojets, but the combustion products are then accelerated through a [[convergent-divergent nozzle]] to supersonic speeds.  As they have no mechanical means of compression, ramjets cannot start from a standstill, and generally do not achieve sufficient compression until supersonic flight.  The lack of intricate turbomachinery allows ramjets to deal with the temperature rise associated with decelerating a supersonic flow to subsonic speeds, but this only goes so far: at near-hypersonic velocities, the temperature rise and inefficiencies discourage decelerating the flow to the magnitude found in ramjet engines.{{sfn |Hill|Peterson|1992| pp=21}}\n\nScramjet engines operate on the same principles as ramjets, but do not decelerate the flow to subsonic velocities.  Rather, a scramjet combustor is supersonic: the inlet decelerates the flow to a lower Mach number for combustion, after which it is accelerated to an even higher Mach number through the nozzle.  By limiting the amount of deceleration, temperatures within the engine are kept at a tolerable level, from both a material and combustive standpoint.  Even so, current scramjet technology requires the use of high-energy fuels and active cooling schemes to maintain sustained operation, often using [[hydrogen]] and [[regenerative cooling (rocket)|regenerative cooling]] techniques.{{sfn |Segal|2009| pp=4}}\n\n==Theory==\nAll scramjet engines have an intake which compresses the incoming air, fuel injectors, a combustion chamber, and a divergent [[propulsive nozzle|thrust nozzle]]. Sometimes engines also include a region which acts as a [[flame holder]], although the high [[stagnation temperature]]s mean that an area of focused waves may be used, rather than a discrete engine part as seen in turbine engines.  Other engines use [[pyrophoric]] fuel additives, such as [[silane]], to avoid flameout.  An isolator between the inlet and combustion chamber is often included to improve the homogeneity of the flow in the combustor and to extend the operating range of the engine.\n\n[[File:X-43A (Hyper - X) Mach 7 computational fluid dynamic (CFD).jpg|thumb|265px|[[Computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) image of the [[NASA]] [[X-43A]] with scramjet attached to the underside at [[Mach number|Mach]] 7|alt=Computer-generated image of stress and shock-waves experienced by aerial vehicle travelling at high speed ]]\n\nA scramjet is reminiscent of a [[ramjet]]. In a typical ramjet, the supersonic inflow of the engine is decelerated at the inlet to subsonic speeds and then reaccelerated through a nozzle to supersonic speeds to produce thrust. This deceleration, which is produced by a normal [[shock wave|shock]],  creates a total [[pressure]] loss which limits the upper operating point of a ramjet engine.\n\nFor a scramjet, the kinetic energy of the freestream air entering the scramjet engine is largely comparable to the energy released by the reaction of the oxygen content of the air with a fuel (e.g. hydrogen). Thus the heat released from combustion at Mach 25 is around 10% of the total enthalpy of the working fluid. Depending on the fuel, the [[kinetic energy]] of the air and the potential combustion heat release will be equal at around Mach 8. Thus the design of a scramjet engine is as much about minimizing drag as maximizing thrust.\n\nThis high speed makes the control of the flow within the combustion chamber more difficult. Since the flow is supersonic, no downstream influence propagates within the freestream of the combustion chamber. Throttling of the entrance to the thrust nozzle is not a usable control technique. In effect, a block of gas entering the combustion chamber must mix with fuel and have sufficient time for initiation and reaction, all the while traveling supersonically through the combustion chamber, before the burned gas is expanded through the thrust nozzle. This places stringent requirements on the pressure and temperature of the flow, and requires that the fuel injection and mixing be extremely efficient. Usable [[dynamic pressure]]s lie in the range {{convert|20|to|200|kPa|psi}}, where\n\n:<math>q = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 </math>\n\nwhere\n:''q'' is the dynamic pressure of the gas\n:''\u03c1'' ([[rho (letter)|rho]]) is the [[density]] of the gas\n:''v'' is the [[velocity]] of the gas\n\nTo keep the combustion rate of the fuel constant, the pressure and temperature in the engine must also be constant. This is problematic because the airflow control systems that would facilitate this are not physically possible in a scramjet launch vehicle due to the large speed and altitude range involved, meaning that it must travel at an altitude specific to its speed. Because air density reduces at higher altitudes, a scramjet must climb at a specific rate as it accelerates to maintain a constant air pressure at the intake. This optimal climb/descent profile is called a \"constant dynamic pressure path\". It is thought that scramjets might be operable up to an altitude of 75&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"OrbitalVector\">{{cite web |url=http://www.orbitalvector.com/Orbital%20Travel/Scramjets/Scramjets.htm |title=Scramjets |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212164212/http://www.orbitalvector.com/Orbital%20Travel/Scramjets/Scramjets.htm |archivedate=2016-02-12 |accessdate=2016-02-12 }}</ref>\n\nFuel injection and management is also potentially complex. One possibility would be that the fuel be pressurized to 100 bar by a turbo pump, heated by the fuselage, sent through the turbine and accelerated to higher speeds than the air by a nozzle. The air and fuel stream are crossed in a comb like structure, which generates a large interface. Turbulence due to the higher speed of the fuel leads to additional mixing. Complex fuels like kerosene need a long engine to complete combustion.\n\nThe minimum Mach number at which a scramjet can operate is limited by the fact that the compressed flow must be hot enough to burn the fuel, and have pressure high enough that the reaction be finished before the air moves out the back of the engine. Additionally, in order to be called a scramjet, the compressed flow must still be supersonic after combustion. Here two limits must be observed: First, since when a supersonic flow is compressed it slows down, the level of compression must be low enough (or the initial speed high enough) not to slow the gas below Mach 1. If the gas within a scramjet goes below Mach 1 the engine will \"choke\", transitioning to subsonic flow in the combustion chamber. This effect is well known amongst experimenters on scramjets since the waves caused by choking are easily observable. Additionally, the sudden increase in pressure and temperature in the engine can lead to an acceleration of the combustion, leading to the combustion chamber exploding.\n\nSecond, the heating of the gas by combustion causes the speed of sound in the gas to increase (and the Mach number to decrease) even though the gas is still travelling at the same speed. Forcing the speed of air flow in the combustion chamber under Mach 1 in this way is called \"thermal choking\". It is clear that a pure scramjet can operate at Mach numbers of 6-8,<ref name=\"N96-11688\">{{cite book |last=Paull |first1=A. |last2=Stalker |first2=R. J. |last3=Mee |first3=D.

Since these results have not been published openly, they remain unverified and a final design method of scramjet engines still does not exist.\n\nThe final application of a scramjet engine is likely to be in conjunction with engines which can operate outside the scramjet's operating range.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\nDual-mode scramjets combine [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] combustion with [[supersonic]] combustion for operation at lower speeds, and [[rocket]]-based combined cycle (RBCC) engines supplement a traditional rocket's  propulsion with a scramjet, allowing for additional [[oxidizer]] to be added to the scramjet flow.

Therefore, time in the atmosphere at subsonic speed would be considerable, possibly 15\u201330 minutes. Similar to a [[Atmospheric reentry|reentering]] space vehicle, heat insulation would be a formidable task, with protection required for a duration longer than that of a typical [[space capsule]], although less than the [[space shuttle]].\n\nNew materials offer good insulation at high temperature, but they often [[Ablation|sacrifice]] themselves in the process. Therefore, studies often plan on \"active cooling\", where coolant circulating throughout the vehicle skin prevents it from disintegrating. Often the coolant is the fuel itself, in much the same way that modern rockets use their own fuel and oxidizer as coolant for their engines. All cooling systems add weight and complexity to a launch system. The cooling of scramjets in this way may result in greater efficiency, as heat is added to the fuel prior to entry into the engine, but results in increased complexity and weight which ultimately could outweigh any performance gains.\n\n===Vehicle performance===\n[[File:Specific-impulse-kk-20090105.png|thumb|400px|The specific impulse of various engines]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}\nThe performance of a [[Launch vehicle|launch system]] is complex and depends greatly on its weight. Normally craft are designed to maximise range (<math>R</math>), orbital radius (<math>R</math>) or payload mass fraction (<math>\\Gamma</math>) for a given engine and fuel. This results in tradeoffs between the efficiency of the engine (takeoff fuel weight) and the complexity of the engine (takeoff dry weight), which can be expressed by the following:\n\n:<math>\\Pi_e+\\Pi_f+\\frac{1}{\\Gamma}=1</math>\n\nWhere :\n*<math>\\Pi_e=\\frac{m_\\text{empty}}{m_\\text{initial}}</math> is the empty mass fraction, and represents the weight of the superstructure, tankage and engine.\n*<math>\\Pi_f=\\frac{m_\\text{fuel}}{m_\\text{initial}}</math> is the fuel mass fraction, and represents the weight of fuel, oxidiser and any other materials which are consumed during the launch.\n*<math>\\Gamma=\\frac{m_\\text{initial}}{m_\\text{payload}}</math> is initial mass ratio, and is the inverse of the payload mass fraction. This represents how much payload the vehicle can deliver to a destination.\n\nA scramjet increases the mass of the moter <math>\\Pi_e</math> over a rocket, and decreases the mass of the fuel <math>\\Pi_f</math>. It can be difficult to decide whether this will result in an increased <math>\\Gamma</math> (which would be an increased payload delivered to a destination for a constant vehicle takeoff weight). The logic behind efforts driving a scramjet is (for example) that the reduction in fuel decreases the total mass by 30%, while the increased engine weight adds 10% to the vehicle total mass. Unfortunately the uncertainty in the calculation of any mass or efficiency changes in a vehicle is so great that slightly different assumptions for engine efficiency or mass can provide equally good arguments for or against scramjet powered vehicles.\n\nAdditionally, the drag of the new configuration must be considered. The drag of the total configuration can be considered as the sum of the vehicle drag (<math>D</math>) and the engine installation drag (<math>D_e</math>). The installation drag traditionally results from the pylons and the coupled flow due to the engine jet, and is a function of the throttle setting. Thus it is often written as:\n\n<math>D_e=\\phi_eF</math>\nWhere:\n*<math>\\phi_e</math> is the loss coefficient\n*<math>F</math> is the thrust of the engine\n\nFor an engine strongly integrated into the aerodynamic body, it may be more convenient to think of (<math>D_e</math>) as the difference in drag from a known base configuration.\n\nThe overall [[engine efficiency]] can be represented as a value between 0 and 1 (<math>\\eta_0</math>), in terms of the [[specific impulse]] of the engine:\n\n:<math>\\eta_0=\\frac{g_0V_0}{h_{PR}}\\cdot I_{sp}=\\frac{\\mbox{Thrust Power}}{\\mbox{Chemical energy rate}}</math>\n\nWhere:\n*<math>g_0</math> is the acceleration due to gravity at ground level\n*<math>V_0</math> is the vehicle speed\n*<math>I_{sp}</math> is the [[specific impulse]]\n*<math>h_{PR}</math> is fuel [[heat of reaction]]\n\nSpecific impulse is often used as the unit of efficiency for rockets, since in the case of the rocket, there is a direct relation between specific impulse, [[Specific fuel consumption (thrust)|specific fuel consumption]] and exhaust velocity. This direct relation is not generally present for airbreathing engines, and so specific impulse is less used in the literature. Note that for an airbreathing engine, both <math>\\eta_0</math> and <math>I_{sp}</math> are a function of velocity.\n\nThe specific impulse of a [[rocket]] engine is independent of velocity, and common values are between 200 and 600 seconds (450s for the space shuttle main engines). The specific impulse of a scramjet varies with velocity, reducing at higher speeds, starting at about 1200s,{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} although values in the literature vary.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nFor the simple case of a single stage vehicle, the fuel mass fraction can be expressed as:\n:<math>\\Pi_f=1-\\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\left(\\frac{V_{initial}^2}{2}-\\frac{V_i^2}{2}\\right)+\\int{g}\\,dr}{\\eta_0h_{PR}\\left(1-\\frac{D+D_e}{F}\\right)}\\right]</math>\n\nWhere this can be expressed for [[single-stage-to-orbit|single stage transfer to orbit]] as:\n\n:<math>\\Pi_f=1-\\exp\\left[-\\frac{g_0r_0\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{r_0}{r}\\right)}{\\eta_0h_{PR}\\left(1-\\frac{D+D_e}{F}\\right)}\\right]</math>\n\nor for level atmospheric flight from [[air launch]] ([[missile]] flight):\n\n:<math>\\Pi_f=1-\\exp\\left[-\\frac{g_0R}{\\eta_0h_{PR}\\left(1-\\phi_e\\right)\\frac{C_L}{C_D}}\\right]</math>\n\nWhere <math>R</math> is the [[Range (aircraft)|range]], and the calculation can be expressed in the form of the [[Louis Charles Breguet|Breguet]] range formula:\n\n:<math>\\Pi_f=1-e^{-BR}</math>\n:<math>B=\\frac{g_0}{\\eta_0h_{PR}\\left(1-\\phi_e\\right)\\frac{C_L}{C_D}}</math>\n\nWhere:\n*<math>{C_L}</math> is the [[lift coefficient]]\n*<math>{C_D}</math> is the [[drag coefficient]]\n\nThis extremely simple formulation, used for the purposes of discussion assumes:\n*[[single-stage-to-orbit|Single stage]] vehicle\n*No aerodynamic lift for the transatmospheric lifter\n\nHowever they are true generally for all engines.\n\n===Initial propulsion requirements===\nA scramjet cannot produce efficient thrust unless boosted to high speed, around Mach 5, although depending on the design it could act as a ramjet at low speeds. A horizontal take-off aircraft would need conventional [[turbofan]] or rocket engines to take off, sufficiently large to move a heavy craft. Also needed would be fuel for those engines, plus all engine-associated mounting structure and control systems. [[Turbofan]] engines are heavy and cannot easily exceed about Mach 2-3, so another propulsion method would be needed to reach scramjet operating speed. That could be [[ramjet]]s or [[rocket]]s. Those would also need their own separate fuel supply, structure, and systems.  Many proposals instead call for a first stage of droppable [[solid rocket booster]]s, which greatly simplifies the design.\n\n===Testing difficulties===\n[[File:SJX61 1EngineTest20070221 TransitionToJP7.jpg|thumb|Test of [[Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne]] [[SJY61]] scramjet engine for the [[Boeing X-51]]]]\nUnlike jet or rocket propulsion systems facilities which can be tested on the ground, testing scramjet designs use extremely expensive hypersonic test chambers or expensive launch vehicles, both of which lead to high instrumentation costs. Tests using launched test vehicles very typically end with destruction of the test item and instrumentation.\n\n===Disadvantages===\n#Difficult / expensive testing and development\n#Very high initial propulsion requirements\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages for orbital vehicles==\n\n===Propellant===\nAn advantage of a hypersonic airbreathing (typically scramjet) vehicle like the [[X-30]] is avoiding or at least reducing the need for carrying oxidizer. For example, the [[Space Shuttle program|space shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]] holds 616,432.2&nbsp;kg of [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) and 103,000&nbsp;kg of [[liquid hydrogen]] (LH2) while having an empty weight of 30,000&nbsp;kg. The [[Space Shuttle Orbiter|orbiter]] gross weight is 109,000&nbsp;kg with a maximum payload of about 25,000&nbsp;kg and to get the assembly off the launch pad the shuttle uses two very powerful [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters]] with a weight of 590,000&nbsp;kg each. If the oxygen could be eliminated, the vehicle could be lighter at liftoff and maybe carry more payload. That would be an advantage, but the central motivation in pursuing hypersonic airbreathing vehicles would be to reduce cost.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nOn the other hand, scramjets spend more time in the atmosphere and require more hydrogen fuel to deal with aerodynamic drag. Whereas liquid oxygen is quite a dense fluid (1141&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3), liquid hydrogen has much lower density (70.85&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3)and takes up much more volume. This means that the vehicle using this fuel becomes much bigger and gives even more drag.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johns |first1=Lionel S. |last2=Shaw |first2=Alan |last3=Sharfman |first3=Peter |last4=Williamson |first4=Ray A. |last5=DalBello |first5=Richard |url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=Smtn0fbL-EAC&pg=PA78 |title=Round Trip to Orbit: Human Spaceflight Alternatives |chapter=The National Aero-Space Plane |chapter-url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=Smtn0fbL-EAC&pg=PA65 |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |publisher=[[Congress of the United States]] |year=1989 |page=78 |accessdate=2016-02-12 }}</ref> \nOther fuels have more comparable density however, such as [[RP-1]] (464&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3) [[JP-7]] (Density at 15&nbsp;\u00b0C 779\u2013806&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3) and [[Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine|UDMH]] (793.00&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3).\n\n===Thrust-to-weight ratio===\nOne issue is that scramjet engines are predicted to have exceptionally poor [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] of around 2, when installed in a launch vehicle.<ref name=\"JBIS\">{{cite journal|title=A Comparison of Propulsion Concepts for SSTO Reusable Launchers |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |year=2003 |last=Varvill |first=Richard |last2=Bond |first2=Alan |volume=56 |pages=108\u2013117 |issn=0007-084X |url=http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/downloads/JBIS_v56_108-117.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2016-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628231043/http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/downloads/JBIS_v56_108-117.pdf |archivedate=June 28, 2012 }}</ref> A rocket has the advantage that its engines have ''very'' high thrust-weight ratios (~100:1), while the tank to hold the liquid oxygen approaches a tankage ratio of ~100:1 also. Thus a rocket can achieve a very high [[Propellant mass fraction|mass fraction]], which improves performance. By way of contrast the projected thrust/weight ratio of scramjet engines of about 2 mean a very much larger percentage of the takeoff mass is engine (ignoring that this fraction increases anyway by a factor of about four due to the lack of onboard oxidiser). In addition the vehicle's lower thrust does not necessarily avoid the need for the expensive, bulky, and failure prone high performance turbopumps found in conventional liquid-fuelled rocket engines, since most scramjet designs seem to be incapable of orbital speeds in airbreathing mode, and hence extra rocket engines are needed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n===Need for additional propulsion to reach orbit===\nScramjets might be able to accelerate from approximately Mach 5-7 to around somewhere between half of [[orbital speed]] and orbital speed (X-30 research suggested that Mach 17 might be the limit compared to an orbital speed of Mach 25, and other studies put the upper speed limit for a pure scramjet engine between Mach 10 and 25, depending on the assumptions made). Generally, another propulsion system (very typically, a rocket is proposed) is expected to be needed for the final acceleration into orbit.  Since the delta-V is moderate and the payload fraction of scramjets high, lower performance rockets such as solids, hypergolics, or simple liquid fueled boosters might be acceptable.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nTheoretical projections place the top speed of a scramjet between {{convert|12|Mach|200,000|sigfig=2}} and {{convert|24|Mach|240,000|sigfig=2}}.<ref name=\"UnPoCa Tech Report\">{{cite web |url=http://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/handle/2099.1/20295/Technical%20Report.pdf |format=PDF |title=Study of an Air-Breathing Engine for Hypersonic Flight |last=Mateu |first=Marta Marimon |publisher=[[Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya]] |date=2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212184839/http://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/handle/2099.1/20295/Technical%20Report.pdf |archivedate=2016-02-12 |accessdate=2016-02-12 |quote=Figure 9-10, Page 20 }}</ref> For comparison, the orbital speed at {{convert|200|km|mi}} [[low earth orbit]] is {{convert|7.79|km/s|mph km/h}}.<ref name=\"ASaca\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceacademy.net.au/watch/track/leopars.htm |title=Orbital Parameters - Low Earth Circular Orbits |work=Space Surveillance |publisher=Australian Space Academy |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211202014/http://www.spaceacademy.net.au/watch/track/leopars.htm |archivedate=2016-02-11 |accessdate=2016-02-11 }}</ref>\n\n===Reentry===\nThe scramjet's heat-resistant underside potentially doubles as its reentry system if a single-stage-to-orbit vehicle using non-ablative, non-active cooling is visualised. If an ablative shielding is used on the engine it will probably not be usable after ascent to orbit. If active cooling is used with the fuel as coolant, the loss of all fuel during the burn to orbit will also mean the loss of all cooling for the thermal protection system.\n\n===Costs===\nReducing the amount of fuel and oxidizer does not necessarily improve costs as rocket propellants are comparatively very cheap. Indeed, the unit cost of the vehicle can be expected to end up far higher, since aerospace hardware cost is about two orders of magnitude higher than liquid oxygen, fuel and tankage, and scramjet hardware seems to be much heavier than rockets for any given payload. Still, if scramjets enable reusable vehicles, this could theoretically be a cost benefit. Whether equipment subject to the extreme conditions of a scramjet can be reused sufficiently many times is unclear; all flown scramjet tests only survive for short periods and have never been designed to survive a flight to date.\n\nThe eventual cost of such a vehicle is the subject of intense debate{{By whom|date=May 2010}} since even the best estimates disagree whether a scramjet vehicle would be advantageous. It is likely that a scramjet vehicle would need to lift more load than a rocket of equal takeoff weight in order to be equally as cost efficient (if the scramjet is a non-reusable vehicle).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n===Issues===\n\nSpace launch vehicles may or may not benefit from having a scramjet stage.

This is compensated for in scramjets partly because the weight of the vehicle would be carried by aerodynamic lift rather than pure rocket power (giving reduced '[[gravity drag|gravity losses]]'),{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} but scramjets would take much longer to get to orbit due to lower thrust which greatly offsets the advantage. The takeoff weight of a scramjet vehicle is significantly reduced over that of a rocket, due to the lack of onboard oxidiser, but increased by the structural requirements of the larger and heavier engines.\n\nWhether this vehicle could be reusable or not is still a subject of debate and research.\n\n==Applications==\n\nAn aircraft using this type of jet engine could dramatically reduce the time it takes to travel from one place to another, potentially putting any place on [[Earth]] within a 90-minute flight. However, there are questions about whether such a vehicle could carry enough fuel to make useful length trips, and there are heavy FAA regulations regarding aircraft that create [[sonic boom]]s over United States land.<ref name=\"FAA-SBoom\">{{cite web |url=http://elr.info/news-analysis/3/10067/faa-promulgates-strict-new-sonic-boom-regulation |title=FAA Promulgates Strict New Sonic Boom Regulation |work=The Environmental Law Reporter |publisher=[[Environmental Law Institute]] |date=1973 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212190841/http://elr.info/news-analysis/3/10067/faa-promulgates-strict-new-sonic-boom-regulation |archivedate=2016-02-12 |accessdate=2016-02-12 }}</ref><ref name=\"RisingUp\">{{cite web |url=http://www.risingup.com/fars/info/part91-817-FAR.shtml |title=Sec. 91.817 \u2014 Civil aircraft sonic boom. |work=FAA Regulations |publisher=RisingUp Aviation |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212191141/http://www.risingup.com/fars/info/part91-817-FAR.shtml |archivedate=2016-02-12 |accessdate=2016-02-12 }}</ref>\n\nScramjet vehicle has been proposed for a [[single stage to tether]] vehicle, where a Mach 12 spinning [[space tether|orbital tether]] would pick up a payload from a vehicle at around 100&nbsp;km and carry it to orbit.<ref name=\"NIAC\">{{cite conference |last=Bogar |first=Thomas J. |last2=Forward |first2=Robert L. |last3=Bangham |first3=Michal E. |last4=Lewis |first4=Mark J. |title=Hypersonic Airplane Space Tether Orbital Launch (HASTOL) System |url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/library/meetings/fellows/nov99/355Bogar.pdf |conference=NIAC Fellows Meeting |publisher=[[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts]] |place=[[Atlanta, Georgia]] |date=1999-11-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212191315/http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/library/meetings/fellows/nov99/355Bogar.pdf |archivedate=2016-02-12 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Aviation}}\n*[[Single-stage to orbit]]\n*[[Liquid air cycle engine]]\n*[[Precooled jet engine]]\n*[[List of emerging technologies]]\n*[[Atmospheric reentry]]\n*[[Busemann's Biplane]]\n*[[Pulse detonation engine]]\n*[[Shcramjet]]\n*[[Ram accelerator]]\n*[[The Hy-V Scramjet Flight Experiment]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{refimprove|date=September 2010}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* {{cite book |last=Segal |first1=Corin |url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=lWXGuyj8FwoC |title=The Scramjet Engine: Processes and Characteristics |work=Cambridge Aerospace Series |location=[[New York, New York]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-0521838153 |accessdate=2016-02-13 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Hill |first1=Philip Graham |last2=Peterson |first2=Carl R. |url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=8ihcPgAACAAJ |title=Mechanics and Thermodynamics of Propulsion |edition=2 |location=[[Reading, Massachusetts]] |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley Publishing Company]] |year=1992 |isbn=978-0201146592 |accessdate=2016-02-13 }}\n* {{cite conference |last=Billig |first=Frederick S. |authorlink=Frederick S.
