Usually a transducer converts a [[wikt:signal#Noun|signal]] in one form of energy to a signal in another.<ref>Agarwal, Anant. Foundations of Analog and Digital Electronic Circuits.Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2005, p. 43</ref>\n\nTransducers are often employed at the boundaries of [[automation]], [[Measuring instrument|measurement]], and [[control system]]s, where electrical signals are converted to and from other physical quantities (energy, force, torque, light, motion, position, etc.). The process of converting one [[form of energy]] to another is known as [[transduction]].<ref name=\"Audio1\">To cite a book with a credited author {{cite book |last=Winer |first=Ethan |date=2013 |title=The Audio Expert |location=New York and London |publisher=Focal Press |chapter=Part 3 |isbn=978-0-240-82100-9}}</ref>\n\n==Transducer types==\n\n===Passive===\nPassive sensors require an external power source to operate, which is called an excitation signal. The signal is modulated by the sensor to produce an output signal. For example, a thermistor does not generate any electrical signal, but by passing an electric current through it, its resistance can be measured by detecting variations in the current and/or voltage across the thermistor, LVDT.<ref>Fraden J. (2016). Handbook of Modern Sensors: Physics, Designs, and Applications 5th ed. Springer. p.7</ref><ref name=\"Audio1\"/>\n\n===Active===\nActive sensors generate electric signals in response to an external stimulus without the need of an additional energy source.  Such examples are a thermocouple, photodiode, and a piezoelectric sensor, thermocouple.<ref>Fraden J. (2016). Handbook of Modern Sensors: Physics, Designs, and Applications 5th ed. Springer. p.7</ref>\n\n===Sensors===\nA [[sensor]] is a device that receives and responds to a signal or stimulus.<ref>Fraden J. (2016). Handbook of Modern Sensors: Physics, Designs, and Applications 5th ed. Springer. p.1</ref> Transducer is the other term that is sometimes interchangeably used instead of the term sensor, although there are subtle differences.  A transducer is a term that can be used for the definition of many devices such as sensors, actuators, or transistors.<ref>Kalantar-zadeh, K. (2013). Sensors: An Introductory Course 2013th Edition. Springer. p.1</ref><ref name=\"Audio1\"/>\n\n===Actuators===\nAn actuator is a device that is responsible for moving or controlling a mechanism or system. It is operated by a source of energy, which can be mechanical force, electrical current, hydraulic fluid pressure, or pneumatic pressure, and converts that energy into motion. An actuator is the mechanism by which a control system acts upon an environment. The control system can be simple (a fixed mechanical or electronic system), software-based (e.g. a printer driver, robot control system), a human, or any other input.<ref name=\"Audio1\"/>\n\n===Bidirectional===\n\nBidirectional transducers convert physical phenomena to electrical signals and also convert electrical signals into physical phenomena. \nExamples of inherently bidirectional transducers are [[antenna (radio)|antennae]], which can convert conducted electrical signals to or from propagating electromagnetic waves, and voice coils, which convert electrical signals into sound (when used in a loudspeaker) or sound into electrical signals (when used in a microphone).  Likewise, DC electric motors may be used to generate electrical power if the motor shaft is turned by an external torque.<ref name=\"Audio1\"/>\n\n==Ideal characteristics==\n*High [[Dynamic Range|dynamic range]]<ref name=\"Audio1\"/>\n*High [[repeatability]]\n*Low [[Noise (electronic)|noise]]\n*Low [[hysteresis]]\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Signal processing system.png|thumb|Transducers are used in [[Electronics|electronic]] [[communications system]]s to convert signals of various physical forms to [[Signal (electronics)|electronic signals]], and ''vice versa''. In this example, the first transducer could be a [[microphone]], and the second transducer could be a [[loudspeaker|speaker]].|424x424px]]\n*Electromagnetic:\n**[[Antenna (radio)|Antennae]] \u2013 converts propagating electromagnetic waves to and from conducted electrical signals\n**[[magnetic cartridge]]s \u2013 converts relative physical motion to and from electrical signals\n**[[Tape head]], [[disk read-and-write head]]s \u2013 converts magnetic fields on a [[magnetic medium]] to and from electrical signals\n**[[Hall effect sensor]]s \u2013 converts a [[magnetic field]] level into an electrical signal\n*Electrochemical:\n**[[pH meter|pH probes]]\n**[[Electro-galvanic fuel cell]]s\n**[[Hydrogen sensor]]s\n*Electromechanical (electromechanical output devices are generically called [[actuator]]s):\n**[[Accelerometer]]s\n**[[mass flow sensor|Air flow sensors]]\n**[[Electroactive polymers]]\n**[[Electric motor|Rotary motors]], [[linear motor]]s\n**[[Galvanometer|Galvonometers]]\n**[[Linear variable differential transformer]]s or [[Rotary variable differential transformer|rotary variably differential transformers]]\n**[[Load cell]]s \u2013 converts force to mV/V electrical signal using [[strain gauge|strain gauges]]\n**[[Microelectromechanical systems]]\n**[[Potentiometer]]s (when used for measuring position)\n**[[Pressure sensor]]s\n**[[String potentiometer]]s\n**[[Tactile sensor]]s\n**[[Vibration powered generator]]s\n*Electroacoustic:\n**[[Loudspeaker]]s, [[earphone]]s \u2013 converts electrical signals into sound ([[amplifier|amplified]] signal \u2192 [[magnetic field]] \u2192 [[Motion (physics)|motion]] \u2192 air pressure)\n**[[Microphone]]s \u2013 converts sound into an electrical signal (air pressure \u2192 [[Motion (physics)|motion]] of conductor/coil \u2192 [[magnetic field]] \u2192 electrical signal)<ref name=\"Audio1\"/>\n**[[Pickup (music technology)]] \u2013 converts motion of metal strings into an electrical signal ([[magnetism]] \u2192 electrical signal)\n**[[Tactile transducer]]s \u2013 converts electrical signal into vibration ( electrical signal \u2192 vibration)\n**[[Piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric crystals]] \u2013 converts deformations of solid-state crystals (vibrations) to and from electrical signals\n**[[Geophone]]s \u2013 converts a ground movement (displacement) into voltage (vibrations \u2192 motion of conductor/coil \u2192 [[magnetic field]] \u2192 signal)\n**[[Phonograph|Gramophone pickups]] \u2013 (air pressure \u2192 [[Motion (physics)|motion]] \u2192 [[magnetic field]] \u2192 electrical signal)\n**[[Hydrophone]]s \u2013 converts changes in water pressure into an electrical signal\n**[[Sonar#Transponder|Sonar transponders]] (water pressure \u2192 [[Motion (physics)|motion]] of conductor/coil \u2192 [[magnetic field]] \u2192 electrical signal)\n**[[Ultrasonic transceiver]]s, transmitting [[ultrasound]] (transduced from electricity) as well as receiving it after [[sound reflection]] from target objects, availing for imaging of those objects.\n*Electro-optical ([[Photoelectric effect|Photoelectric]]):\n**[[Fluorescent lamp]]s \u2013 converts electrical power into [[Coherence (physics)|incoherent light]]\n**[[Incandescent lamp]]s \u2013 converts electrical power into [[Coherence (physics)|incoherent light]]\n**[[Light-emitting diode]]s \u2013 converts electrical power into [[Coherence (physics)|incoherent light]]\n**[[Laser diode]]s \u2013 converts electrical power into [[Coherence (physics)|coherent light]]\n**[[Photodiode]]s, [[photoresistor]]s, [[phototransistor]]s, [[photomultiplier]]s \u2013 converts changing light levels into electrical signals\n**[[Photodetector]] or [[photoresistor]] or light dependent resistor (LDR) \u2013 converts changes in light levels into changes in electrical resistance\n**[[Cathode ray tube|Cathode-ray tubes]] (CRT) \u2013 converts electrical signals into visual signals\n*Electrostatic:\n**[[Electrometer]]s\n*Thermoelectric:\n**[[Resistance temperature detector]]s (RTD) \u2013 converts temperature into an electrical resistance signal\n**[[Thermocouple]]s \u2013 converts relative temperatures of metallic junctions to electrical voltage\n**[[Thermistor]]s (includes PTC resistor and NTC resistor)\n*Radioacoustic:\n**[[Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tube|Geiger-M\u00fcller tubes]] \u2013 converts incident ionizing radiation to an electrical impulse signal\n**[[Receiver (radio)|Radio receivers]] converts electromagnetic transmissions to electrical signals.\n**[[Transmitter (radio)|Radio transmitters]] converts electrical signals to electromagnetic transmissions.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Horn analyzer]]\n* [[List of sensors]]\n* [[Tactile sensor]]\n\n== References ==\n*Agarwal, Anant.
