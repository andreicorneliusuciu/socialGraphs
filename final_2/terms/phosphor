Somewhat confusingly, this includes both [[Phosphorescence|phosphorescent]] materials, which show a slow decay in brightness (> 1&nbsp;ms), and [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] materials, where the emission decay takes place over tens of nanoseconds. Phosphorescent materials are known for their use in radar screens and glow-in-the-dark materials, whereas fluorescent materials are common in [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) and plasma video display screens, sensors, and white [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]s.\n\nPhosphors are often [[transition metal]] compounds or [[rare earth element|rare earth]] compounds of various types. The most common uses of phosphors are in CRT displays and [[fluorescent light]]s. CRT phosphors were standardized beginning around [[World War II]] and designated by the letter \"P\" followed by a number.\n\n[[Phosphorus]], the chemical element named for its light-emitting behavior, emits light due to [[chemiluminescence]], not phosphorescence.<ref>{{cite book|author =Emsley, John|year = 2000|title = The Shocking History of Phosphorus |location= London|publisher =Macmillan|isbn=0-330-39005-8}}.</ref>\n\n==Principles==\nA material can emit light either through [[incandescence]], where all atoms radiate, or by [[luminescence]], where only a small fraction of atoms, called '''emission centers''' or '''luminescence centers''', emit light. In inorganic phosphors, these inhomogeneities in the crystal structure are created usually by addition of a trace amount of [[dopant]]s, impurities called '''[[activator (phosphor)|activators]]'''. (In rare cases [[dislocation]]s or other [[crystal defect]]s can play the role of the impurity.) The wavelength emitted by the emission center is dependent on the atom itself, and on the surrounding crystal structure.\n\nThe scintillation process in inorganic materials is due to the [[electronic band structure]] found in the [[crystal]]s. An incoming particle can excite an electron from the [[valence band]] to either the [[conduction band]] or the [[exciton]] band (located just below the conduction band and separated from the valence band by an [[energy gap]]). This leaves an associated [[electron hole|hole]] behind, in the valence band. Impurities create electronic levels in the [[forbidden gap]]. The excitons are loosely bound [[electron-hole pair]]s that wander through the [[crystal lattice]] until they are captured as a whole by impurity centers. The latter then rapidly de-excite by emitting scintillation light (fast component). In case of inorganic [[scintillator]]s, the activator impurities are typically chosen so that the emitted light is in the visible range or [[near ultraviolet|near-UV]] where [[photomultiplier]]s are effective. The holes associated with electrons in the conduction band are independent from the latter. Those holes and electrons are captured successively by impurity centers exciting certain [[metastable state]]s not accessible to the excitons. The delayed de-excitation of those metastable impurity states, slowed down by reliance on the low-probability [[forbidden mechanism]], again results in light emission (slow component).\n\n===Phosphor degradation===\nMany phosphors tend to lose efficiency gradually by several mechanisms. The activators can undergo change of [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] (usually [[oxidation]]), the [[crystal lattice]] degrades, atoms \u2013 often the activators \u2013 diffuse through the material, the surface undergoes chemical reactions with the environment with consequent loss of efficiency or buildup of a layer absorbing either the exciting or the radiated energy, etc.\n\nThe degradation of electroluminescent devices depends on frequency of driving current, the luminance level, and temperature; moisture impairs phosphor lifetime very noticeably as well.\n\nHarder, high-melting, water-insoluble materials display lower tendency to lose luminescence under operation.<ref name=\"advelectr\"/>\n\nExamples:\n*BaMgAl<sub>10</sub>O<sub>17</sub>:Eu<sup>2+</sup> (BAM), a [[plasma display]] phosphor, undergoes oxidation of the dopant during baking.

Bulk material must be milled to obtain a desired particle size range, since large particles produce a poor quality lamp coating and small particles produce less light and degrade more quickly. During the [[pottery firing|firing]] of the phosphor, process conditions must be controlled to prevent oxidation of the phosphor activators or [[contamination]] from the process vessels. After milling the phosphor may be washed to remove minor excess of activator elements. Volatile elements must not be allowed to escape during processing. Lamp manufacturers have changed composition of phosphors to eliminate some toxic elements, such as [[beryllium]], [[cadmium]], or [[thallium]], formerly used.<ref>Raymond Kane, Heinz Sell ''Revolution in lamps: a chronicle of 50 years of progress (2nd ed.)'', The Fairmont Press, Inc. 2001 ISBN 0-88173-378-4 . Chapter 5 extensively discusses history, application and manufacturing of phosphors for lamps.</ref>\n\nThe commonly quoted parameters for phosphors are the [[wavelength]] of emission maximum (in nanometers, or alternatively [[color temperature]] in kelvins for white blends), the peak width (in nanometers at 50% of intensity), and decay time (in seconds).\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Lighting===\nPhosphor layers provide most of the light produced by [[fluorescent lamp]]s, and are also used to improve the balance of light produced by [[metal halide lamp]]s.  Various [[neon sign]]s use phosphor layers to produce different colors of light. [[Electroluminescent display]]s found, for example, in aircraft instrument panels, use a phosphor layer to produce glare-free illumination or as numeric and graphic display devices. White [[LED]] lamps consist of a blue or ultra-violet emitter with a phosphor coating that emits at longer wavelengths, giving a full spectrum of visible light.\n\n===Phosphor thermometry===\n{{main article|Phosphor thermometry}}\n[[Phosphor thermometry]] is a temperature measurement approach that uses the temperature dependence of certain phosphors. For this, a phosphor coating is applied to a surface of interest and, usually, the decay time is the emission parameter that indicates temperature. Because the illumination and detection optics can be situated remotely, the method may be used for moving surfaces such as high speed motor surfaces. Also, phosphor may be applied to the end of an optical fiber as an optical analog of a thermocouple.\n\n===Glow-in-the-dark toys===\n*[[Calcium sulfide]] with [[strontium sulfide]] with [[bismuth]] as activator, (Ca,Sr)S:Bi, yields blue light with glow times up to 12 hours, red and orange are modifications of the zinc sulfide formula. Red color can be obtained from strontium sulfide.\n*[[Zinc sulfide]] with about 5 ppm of a [[copper]] activator is the most common phosphor for the glow-in-the-dark toys and items. It is also called '''GS''' phosphor.\n*Mix of zinc sulfide and [[cadmium sulfide]] emit color depending on their ratio; increasing of the CdS content shifts the output color towards longer wavelengths; its persistence ranges between 1\u201310 hours.\n*[[Strontium aluminate]] activated by [[europium]], SrAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>:Eu(II):Dy(III), is a newer material with higher brightness and significantly longer glow persistence; it produces green and aqua hues, where green gives the highest brightness and aqua the longest glow time. SrAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>:Eu:Dy is about 10 times brighter, 10 times longer glowing, and 10 times more expensive than ZnS:Cu. The excitation wavelengths for strontium aluminate range from 200 to 450&nbsp;nm. The wavelength for its green formulation is 520&nbsp;nm, its blue-green version emits at 505&nbsp;nm, and the blue one emits at 490&nbsp;nm. Colors with longer wavelengths can be obtained from the strontium aluminate as well, though for the price of some loss of brightness.\n\nIn these applications, the phosphor is directly added to the [[plastic]] used to mold the toys, or mixed with a binder for use as paints.\n\nZnS:Cu phosphor is used in glow-in-the-dark cosmetic creams frequently used for [[Halloween]] [[make-up]]s.\nGenerally, the persistence of the phosphor increases as the wavelength increases. \nSee also [[lightstick]] for [[chemiluminescence]]-based glowing items.\n\n===Radioluminescence===\n{{main article|Radioluminescence}}\nZinc sulfide phosphors are used with [[radioactive]] materials, where the phosphor was excited by the alpha- and beta-decaying isotopes, to create luminescent paint for dials of [[watch]]es and instruments ([[radium dials]]). Between 1913 and 1950 radium-228 and radium-226 were used to activate a phosphor made of [[silver]] [[doped]] zinc sulfide (ZnS:Ag), which gave a greenish glow. The phosphor is not suitable to be used in layers thicker than 25&nbsp;mg/cm\u00b2, as the self-absorption of the light then becomes a problem. Furthermore, zinc sulfide undergoes degradation of its crystal lattice structure, leading to gradual loss of brightness significantly faster than the depletion of radium. ZnS:Ag coated [[spinthariscope]] screens were used by [[Ernest Rutherford]] in his experiments discovering [[atomic nucleus]].\n\n[[Copper]] doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu) is the most common phosphor used and yields blue-green light. Copper and [[magnesium]] doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu,Mg) yields yellow-orange light.\n\n[[Tritium]] is also used as a source of radiation in various products utilizing [[tritium illumination]].\n\n===Electroluminescence===\n{{main article|Electroluminescence}}\n[[Electroluminescence]] can be exploited in light sources. Such sources typically emit from a large area, which makes them suitable for backlights of LCD displays. The excitation of the phosphor is usually achieved by application of high-intensity [[electric field]], usually with suitable frequency. Current electroluminescent light sources tend to degrade with use, resulting in their relatively short operation lifetimes.\n\nZnS:Cu was the first formulation successfully displaying electroluminescence, tested at 1936 by [[Georges Destriau]] in Madame Marie Curie laboratories in Paris.\n\n[[Indium tin oxide]] ('''ITO''', also known under trade name '''IndiGlo''') composite is used in some Timex watches, though as the electrode material, not as a phosphor itself. \"Lighttape\" is another trade name of an electroluminescent material, used in electroluminescent [[light strips]].\n\n===White LEDs===\nWhite [[light-emitting diode]]s are usually blue [[InGaN]] LEDs with a coating of a suitable material. [[Cerium]](III)-doped [[YAG]] ('''YAG:Ce<sup>3+</sup>''', or '''Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>:Ce<sup>3+</sup>''') is often used; it absorbs the light from the blue LED and emits in a broad range from greenish to reddish, with most of output in yellow. This yellow emission combined with the remaining blue emission gives the \u201cwhite\u201d light, which can be adjusted to color temperature as warm (yellowish) or cold (blueish) white. The pale yellow emission of the Ce<sup>3+</sup>:YAG can be tuned by substituting the cerium with other rare earth elements such as [[terbium]] and [[gadolinium]] and can even be further adjusted by substituting some or all of the aluminium in the YAG with gallium. However, this process is not one of phosphorescence. The yellow light is produced by a process known as [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]], the complete absence of an afterglow being one of the characteristics of the process.\n\nSome [[rare-earth]] [[doped]] [[Sialon]]s are [[photoluminescent]] and can serve as phosphors. [[Europium]](II)-doped \u03b2-SiAlON absorbs in [[ultraviolet]] and [[visible light]] spectrum and emits intense broadband visible emission. Its luminance and color does not change significantly with temperature, due to the temperature-stable crystal structure. It has a great potential as a green down-conversion phosphor for white [[LED]]s; a yellow variant also exists. For white LEDs, a blue LED is used with a yellow phosphor, or with a green and yellow SiAlON phosphor and a red CaAlSiN<sub>3</sub>-based (CASN) phosphor.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.science24.com/paper/15977|title=Luminescence and temperature dependency of \u03b2-SiAlON phosphor|author=Youn-Gon Park|journal=Samsung Electro Mechanics Co|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20090915/175305/|title=Sharp to Employ White LED Using Sialon|date=Sep 15, 2009|author=Hideyoshi Kume, Nikkei Electronics}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200602/000020060205A1031052.php|title=New sialon phosphors and white LEDs|author=Hirosaki Naoto|journal=Oyo Butsuri|volume=74|issue=11|page=1449|year=2005|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nWhite LEDs can also be made by coating near ultraviolet (NUV) emitting LEDs with a mixture of high efficiency europium based red and blue emitting phosphors plus green emitting copper and aluminium doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu,Al). This is a method analogous to the way [[fluorescent lamp]]s work.\n\nSome newer white LEDs use a yellow and blue emitter in series, to approximate white; this technology is used in some Motorola phones such as the Blackberry as well as LED lighting and the original version stacked emitters by using GaN on SiC on InGaP but was later found to fracture at higher drive currents.\n\nMany white LEDs used in general lighting systems can be used for data transfer, for example, in systems that modulate the LED to act as a [[beacon]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/11192/chastotnye_harakteristiki_sovremennyh_svetodiodnyh_lyuminofornyh_materialov.htm|title=Frequency characteristics of modern LED phosphor materials|author=M.S.

Bulky CRTs were used in the black-and-white household television (\"TV\") sets that became popular in the 1950s, as well as first-generation, tube-based color TVs, and most earlier computer monitors. CRTs have also been widely used in scientific and engineering instrumentation, such as [[oscilloscope]]s, usually with a single phosphor color, typically green. Phosphors for such applications may have long afterglow, for increased image persistence.\n\nThe phosphors can be deposited as either [[thin film]], or as discrete particles, a powder bound to the surface. Thin films have better lifetime and better resolution, but provide less bright and less efficient image than powder ones. This is caused by multiple internal reflections in the thin film, scattering the emitted light.\n\n'''White''' (in black-and-white): The mix of zinc cadmium sulfide and zinc sulfide silver, the ZnS:Ag+(Zn,Cd)S:Ag is the white '''P4''' phosphor used in black and white television CRTs. Mixes of yellow and blue phosphors are usual. Mixes of red, green and blue, or a single white phosphor, can also be encountered.\n\n'''Red:''' [[Yttrium]] [[oxide]]-[[sulfide]] activated with europium is used as the red phosphor in color CRTs. The development of color TV took a long time due to the search for a red phosphor. The first red emitting rare earth phosphor, YVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup>, was introduced by Levine and Palilla as a primary color in television in 1964.<ref>{{cite journal| doi = 10.1063/1.1723611| title = A new, highly efficient red-emitting cathodoluminescent phosphor (YVO4:Eu) for color television| year = 1964|author = Levine, Albert K.| journal = Applied Physics Letters| volume = 5|page = 118| first2 = Frank C.| last2 = Palilla|bibcode = 1964ApPhL...5..118L| issue = 6 }}</ref> In single crystal form, it was used as an excellent polarizer and laser material.<ref>{{cite journal| doi = 10.1063/1.98500| title = Highly efficient Nd:YVO4 diode-laser end-pumped laser| year = 1987|author = Fields, R.

It is known as the '''P22B''' phosphor. This material, '''zinc sulfide silver''', is still one of the most efficient phosphors in cathode ray tubes. It is used as a blue phosphor in color CRTs.\n\nThe phosphors are usually poor electrical conductors. This may lead to deposition of residual charge on the screen, effectively decreasing the energy of the impacting electrons due to electrostatic repulsion (an effect known as \"sticking\"). To eliminate this, a thin layer of aluminium (about 100&nbsp;nm) is deposited over the phosphors, usually by vacuum evaporation, and connected to the conductive layer inside the tube. This layer also reflects the phosphor light to the desired direction, and protects the phosphor from ion bombardment resulting from an imperfect vacuum.\n\nTo reduce the image degradation by reflection of ambient light, [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]] can be increased by several methods. In addition to black masking of unused areas of screen, the phosphor particles in color screens are coated with pigments of matching color. For example, the red phosphors are coated with [[ferric oxide]] (replacing earlier Cd(S,Se) due to cadmium toxicity), blue phosphors can be coated with marine blue ([[cobalt(II) oxide|CoO]]\u00b7''n''[[alumina|{{chem|Al|2|O|3}}]]) or [[ultramarine]] ({{chem|Na|8|Al|6|Si|6|O|24|S|2}}).

Usually, a combination of phosphors is employed.\n\nThe most common combination is ZnS:Ag+(Zn,Cd)S:Cu,Al (blue+yellow). Other ones are ZnS:Ag+(Zn,Cd)S:Ag (blue+yellow), and ZnS:Ag+ZnS:Cu,Al+Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>S:Eu<sup>3+</sup> (blue+green+red - does not contain cadmium and has poor efficiency). The color tone can be adjusted by the ratios of the components.\n\nAs the compositions contain discrete grains of different phosphors, they produce image that may not be entirely smooth. A single, white-emitting phosphor, (Zn,Cd)S:Ag,Au,Al overcomes this obstacle. Due to its low efficiency, it is used only on very small screens.\n\nThe screens are typically covered with phosphor using sedimentation coating, where particles [[suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] in a solution are let to settle on the surface.<ref name=\"lumdisp\">https://books.google.com/books?id=lKCWAaCiaZgC&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=red+phosphor+color+tv+history&source=bl&ots=1lNMDjUmoG&sig=U7h3jjS-1qT1Cux7XTx-RC6sGLg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyoN_vhJ_NAhWJwBQKHT0aCH8Q6AEIQTAH#v=onepage&q&f=true</ref>\n\n====Reduced-palette color CRTs====\nFor displaying of a limited palette of colors, there are a few options.\n\nIn '''beam penetration tubes''', different color phosphors are layered and separated with dielectric material. The acceleration voltage is used to determine the energy of the electrons; lower-energy ones are absorbed in the top layer of the phosphor, while some of the higher-energy ones shoot through and are absorbed in the lower layer. So either the first color or a mixture of the first and second color is shown. With a display with red outer layer and green inner layer, the manipulation of accelerating voltage can produce a continuum of colors from red through orange and yellow to green.\n\nAnother method is using a mixture of two phosphors with different characteristics. The brightness of one is linearly dependent on electron flux, while the other one's brightness saturates at higher fluxes; the phosphor does not emit any more light regardless how much more electrons impact it. At low electron flux, both phosphors emit together; at higher fluxes, the luminous contribution of the nonsaturating phosphor prevails, changing the combined color.<ref name=\"lumdisp\"/>\n\nSuch displays can have high resolution, due to absence of two-dimensional structuring of RGB CRT phosphors. Their color palette is however very limited. They were used e.g. in some older military radar displays.\n\n====Color television CRTs====\nThe phosphors in color CRTs need higher contrast and resolution than the black and white ones. The energy density of the electron beam is about 100 times greater than in black and white CRTs; the electron spot is focused to about 0.2mm diameter instead of about 0.6mm diameter of the black and white CRTs. Effects related to electron irradiation degradation are therefore more pronounced.\n\nColor CRTs require three different phosphors, emitting in red, green and blue, patterned on the screen. Three separate electron guns are used for color production.\n\nThe composition of the phosphors changed over time, as better phosphors were developed and as environmental concerns led to lowering the content of cadmium and later abandoning it entirely. The (Zn,Cd)S:Ag,Cl was replaced with (Zn,Cd)S:Cu,Al with lower cadmium/zinc ratio, and then with cadmium-free ZnS:Cu,Al.\n\nThe blue phosphor stayed generally unchanged, a silver-doped zinc sulfide. The green phosphor initially used manganese-doped zinc silicate, then evolved through silver-activated cadmium-zinc sulfide, to lower-cadmium copper-aluminium activated formula, and then to cadmium-free version of the same. The red phosphor saw the most changes; it was originally manganese-activated zinc phosphate, then a silver-activated cadmium-zinc sulfide, then the europium(III) activated phosphors appeared; first in an [[yttrium vanadate]] matrix, then in [[yttrium oxide]] and currently in [[yttrium oxysulfide]]. The evolution of the phosphors was therefore:\n* ZnS:Ag - Zn<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>:Mn - Zn<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>:Mn\n* ZnS:Ag - (Zn,Cd)S:Ag - (Zn,Cd)S:Ag\n* ZnS:Ag - (Zn,Cd)S:Ag - YVO<sub>4</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup>\n* ZnS:Ag - (Zn,Cd)S:Cu,Al - Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>S:Eu<sup>3+</sup> or Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:Eu<sup>3+</sup>\n* ZnS:Ag - ZnS:Cu,Al or ZnS:Au,Cu,Al - Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>S:Eu<sup>3+</sup><ref name=\"lumdisp\"/>\n\n====Projection televisions====\nFor [[projection television]]s, where the beam power density can be two orders of magnitude higher than in conventional CRTs, some different phosphors have to be used.\n\nFor blue color, ZnS:Ag,Cl is employed. It however saturates. (La,Gd)OBr:Ce,Tb<sup>3+</sup> can be used as an alternative that is more linear at high energy densities.\n\nFor green, a [[terbium]]-activated Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>Tb<sup>3+</sup>; its color purity and brightness at low excitation densities is worse than the zinc sulfide alternative, but it behaves linear at high excitation energy densities while zinc sulfide saturates. It however also saturates, so Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>:Tb<sup>3+</sup> or Y<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub>:Tb<sup>3+</sup> can be substituted. LaOBr:Tb<sup>3+</sup> is bright but water-sensitive, degradation prone, and the plate-like morphology of its crystals hampers its use; these problems are however solved now, so it is gaining use due to its higher linearity.\n\nFor red, the Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>S:Eu<sup>3+</sup> is used.<ref name=\"lumdisp\"/>\n\n==Standard phosphor types==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Standard phosphor types<ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lWlcJEDukRIC&pg=PA469|title =Phosphor handbook|author = Shigeo Shionoya|chapter = VI: Phosphors for cathode ray tubes|isbn = 0-8493-7560-6|year = 1999|publisher = CRC Press|location = Boca Raton, Fla.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Jankowiak|first=Patrick|title=Cathode Ray Tube Phosphors|url=http://www.bunkerofdoom.com/tubes/crt/crt_phosphor_research.pdf|format=[[PDF]]| publisher= bunkerofdoom.com| accessdate=1 May 2012}}{{unreliable source?|date=January 2013}}<!-- Enthusiast's site - lacks backing of recognised authority ---></ref> \n|-\n!
