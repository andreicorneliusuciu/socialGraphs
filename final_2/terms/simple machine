So a machine that includes friction will not be able to move as large a load as a corresponding ideal machine using the same input force.\n\n==Compound machines==\nA ''compound machine'' is a [[machine (mechanical)|machine]] formed from a set of simple machines connected in series with the output force of one providing the input force to the next.  For example, a [[Vise|bench vise]] consists of a lever (the vise's handle) in series with a screw, and a simple [[gear train]] consists of a number of [[gear]]s ([[Wheel and axle|wheels and axles]]) connected in series.\n\nThe mechanical advantage of a compound machine is the ratio of the output force exerted by the last machine in the series divided by the input force applied to the first machine, that is\n:<math>\\mathrm{MA}_\\text{compound}   =  {F_\\text{outN} \\over F_\\text{in1}} \\,</math>\n\nBecause the output force of each machine is the input of the next, <math>F_\\text{out1} = F_\\text{in2}, \\; F_\\text{out2} = F_\\text{in3}, \\ldots \\; F_\\text{outK} = F_\\text{inK+1}</math>, this mechanical advantage is also given by\n:<math>\\mathrm{MA}_\\text{compound}  =  {F_\\text{out1} \\over F_\\text{in1}} {F_\\text{out2} \\over F_\\text{in2}} {F_\\text{out3} \\over F_\\text{in3}}\\ldots  {F_\\text{outN} \\over F_\\text{inN}}  \\,</math>\nThus, the mechanical advantage of the compound machine is equal to the product of the mechanical advantages of the series of simple machines that form it\n:<math>\\mathrm{MA}_\\text{compound} = \\mathrm{MA}_1 \\mathrm{MA}_2 \\ldots  \\mathrm{MA}_\\text{N}   \\,</math>\n\nSimilarly, the efficiency of a compound machine is also the product of the efficiencies of the series of simple machines that form it\n:<math>\\eta_\\text{compound} = \\eta_1  \\eta_2 \\ldots \\; \\eta_\\text{N}.\\,</math>\n\n==Self-locking machines==\n[[Image:BOLT SCREW UBT 199.JPG|thumb|The [[screw (simple machine)|screw]]'s self-locking property is the reason for its wide use in [[threaded fastener]]s like [[bolt (fastener)|bolt]]s and [[wood screw]]s ]]\n\nIn many simple machines, if the load force ''F<sub>out</sub>'' on the machine is high enough in relation to the input force  ''F<sub>in</sub>'', the machine will move backwards, with the load force doing work on the input force.<ref name=\"Gujral2\">{{cite book   \n  | last = Gujral\n  | first = I.S. \n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Engineering Mechanics\n  | publisher = Firewall Media\n  | year = 2005\n  | location = \n  | pages = 382\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JM0OG-XUyu0C&pg=PA382&dq=%22simple+machine%22+self-locking#v=onepage&q=%22simple%20machine%22%20self-locking&f=false\n  | doi = \n  | isbn = 81-7008-636-1}}</ref>  So these machines can be used in either direction, with the driving force applied to either input point.   For example, if the load force on a lever is high enough, the lever will move backwards, moving the input arm backwards against the input force.  These are called \"''reversible''\", \"''non-locking''\" or \"''overhauling''\"  machines, and the backward motion is called \"''overhauling''\".   However, in some machines, if the frictional forces are high enough, no amount of load force can move it backwards, even if the input force is zero.   This is called a \"''self-locking''\", \"''nonreversible''\", or \"''non-overhauling''\" machine.<ref name=\"Gujral2\" />  These machines can only be set in motion by a force at the input, and when the input force is removed will remain motionless, \"locked\" by friction at whatever position they were left.\n\nSelf-locking occurs mainly in those machines with large areas of sliding contact between moving parts: the [[screw (simple machine)|screw]],  [[inclined plane]], and [[wedge (mechanical device)|wedge]]:\n*The most common example is a screw.  In most screws, applying torque to the shaft can cause it to turn, moving the shaft linearly to do work against a load, but no amount of axial load force against the shaft will cause it to turn backwards.\n*In an inclined plane, a load can be pulled up the plane by a sideways input force, but if the plane is not too steep and there is enough friction between load and plane, when the input force is removed the load will remain motionless and will not slide down the plane, regardless of its weight.\n*A wedge can be driven into a block of wood by force on the end, such as from hitting it with a sledge hammer, forcing the sides apart, but no amount of compression force from the wood walls will cause it to pop back out of the block.\n \nA machine will be self-locking if and only if its efficiency ''\u03b7'' is below 50%:<ref name=\"Gujral2\" />\n\n:<math>\\eta \\equiv \\frac {F_{out}/F_{in} }{d_{in}/d_{out} } < 0.50   \\,</math>\n\nWhether a machine is self-locking depends on both the friction forces ([[Coefficient of friction|coefficient of static friction]]) between its parts, and the distance ratio ''d<sub>in</sub>/d<sub>out</sub>'' (ideal mechanical advantage).  If both the friction and ideal mechanical advantage are high enough, it will self-lock.\n\n===Proof===\nWhen a machine moves in the forward direction from point 1 to point 2, with the input force doing work on a load force,  from conservation of energy<ref name=\"Rao\">{{cite book   \n  | last = Rao\n  | first = S.  \n  | authorlink = \n  |author2=R.

The bearings that form the fulcrum of a lever and that allow the wheel and axle and pulleys to rotate are examples of a [[kinematic pair]] called a hinged joint. Similarly, the flat surface of an inclined plane and wedge are examples of the kinematic pair called a sliding joint. The screw is usually identified as its own kinematic pair called a helical joint.\n\nTwo levers, or cranks, are combined into a planar [[four-bar linkage]] by attaching a link that connects the output of one crank to the input of another.  Additional links can be attached to form a [[six-bar linkage]] or in series to form a robot.<ref name=\"Uicker2003\"/>\n\n===Classification of machines===\nThe identification of simple machines arises from a desire for a systematic method to invent new machines.  Therefore, an important concern is how simple machines are combined to make more complex machines.  One approach is to attach simple machines in series to obtain compound machines.\n\nHowever, a more successful strategy was identified by [[Franz Reuleaux]], who collected and studied over 800 elementary machines.  He realized that a lever, pulley, and wheel and axle are in essence the same device: a body rotating about a hinge. Similarly, an inclined plane, wedge, and screw are a block sliding on a flat surface.<ref>Hartenberg, R.S. & J. Denavit (1964) [http://kmoddl.library.cornell.edu/bib.php?m=23 Kinematic synthesis of linkages], New York: McGraw-Hill, online link from [[Cornell University]].</ref>\n\nThis realization shows that it is the joints, or the connections that provide movement, that are the primary elements of a machine.  Starting with four types of joints, the [[revolute joint]], [[prismatic joint|sliding joint]], [[cam|cam joint]] and [[gear train|gear joint]], and related connections such as cables and belts, it is possible to understand a machine as an assembly of solid parts that connect these joints.<ref name=\"Uicker2003\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Linkage (mechanical)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Machines}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Simple Machine}}\n[[Category:Mechanical engineering]]\n[[Category:Simple machines| ]]"}]}}}}
