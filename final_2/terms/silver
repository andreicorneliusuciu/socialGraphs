Its [[chemical symbol|symbol]] is '''Ag''', from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|argentum}}'', derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''\u1f70\u03c1\u03b3\u1f40\u03c2'' (literally \"shiny\" or \"white\"), and ultimately from a [[Proto-Indo-European language]] [[Proto-Indo-European root|root]] reconstructed as *''h<sub>2</sub>er\u01f5-'', \"grey\" or \"shining\". A soft, white, lustrous [[transition metal]], it exhibits the highest [[electrical conductivity]], [[thermal conductivity]], and [[reflectivity]] of any metal. The metal is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form (\"native silver\"), as an [[alloy]] with [[gold]] and other metals, and in minerals such as [[argentite]] and [[chlorargyrite]]. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of [[copper]], gold, [[lead]], and [[zinc]] [[refining]].\n\nSilver has long been valued as a [[precious metal]]. Silver metal is used in many premodern monetary systems in [[bullion coin]]s, sometimes [[bimetallism|alongside gold]]: while it is more abundant than gold, it is much less abundant as a [[native metal]]. Its purity is typically measured on a [[per-mille]] basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described as \"0.940 fine\". As one of the seven [[metals of antiquity]], silver has had an enduring role in most human cultures.\n\nSilver is used in numerous applications other than [[currency]], such as [[solar panels]], [[water filtration]], [[jewelry]], ornaments, high-value tableware and utensils (hence the term [[Silver (household)|silverware]]), and as an [[investment]] medium ([[coins]] and [[bullion]]). Silver is used industrially in [[electrical contact]]s and [[Electrical conductor|conductors]], in specialized mirrors, window coatings, and in [[catalysis]] of chemical reactions. Silver compounds are used in [[photographic film]] and [[X-rays]]. Dilute [[silver nitrate]] solutions and other silver compounds are used as [[disinfectant]]s and microbiocides ([[oligodynamic effect]]), added to [[bandage]]s and wound-dressings, [[catheter]]s, and other [[medical instrument]]s.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Ag atomic wire.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Silver is extremely ductile, and can be drawn into a monoatomic wire.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.5772/62288 |isbn=978-953-51-2252-4 |chapter=Combined Transmission Electron Microscopy \u2013 In situ Observation of the Formation Process and Measurement of Physical Properties for Single Atomic-Sized Metallic Wires |author=Masuda, Hideki |title=Modern Electron Microscopy in Physical and Life Sciences |editor=Janecek, Milos |editor2=Kral, Robert |publisher=InTech |year=2016}}</ref>]]\nSilver is similar in its physical and chemical properties to its two vertical neighbours in [[group 11 element|group 11]] of the [[periodic table]], [[copper]] and [[gold]].

This is because its filled 4d shell is not very effective in shielding the electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus to the outermost 5s electron, and hence silver is near the bottom of the [[electrochemical series]] (''E''<sup>0</sup>(Ag<sup>+</sup>/Ag) = +0.799&nbsp;V).<ref name=Greenwood1177/> In group 11, silver has the lowest first ionization energy (showing the instability of the 5s orbital), but has higher second and third ionization energies than copper and gold (showing the stability of the 4d orbitals), so that the chemistry of silver is predominantly that of the +1 oxidation state, reflecting the increasingly limited range of oxidation states along the transition series as the d-orbitals fill and stabilize.<ref name=Greenwood1180>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1180</ref> Unlike copper, for which the larger [[hydration energy]] of Cu<sup>2+</sup> as compared to Cu<sup>+</sup> is the reason why the former is the more stable in aqueous solution and solids despite lacking the stable filled d-subshell of the latter, silver is large enough that this factor has a much smaller effect, and furthermore the second ionisation energy of silver is greater than that for copper. Hence, Ag<sup>+</sup> is the stable species in aqueous solution and solids, with Ag<sup>2+</sup> being much less stable as it oxidizes water.<ref name=Greenwood1180/>\n\nIt must be noted despite the above formulations that most silver compounds have significant [[covalent bond|covalent]] character due to the small size and high first ionization energy (730.8&nbsp;kJ/mol) of silver.<ref name=Greenwood1177/> Furthermore, silver's Pauling [[electronegativity]] of 1.93 is higher than that of [[lead]] (1.87), and its [[electron affinity]] of 125.6&nbsp;kJ/mol is much higher than that of [[hydrogen]] (72.8&nbsp;kJ/mol) and not much less than that of [[oxygen]] (141.0&nbsp;kJ/mol).<ref name=Greenwood1176>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1176</ref> Due to its full d-subshell, silver in its main +1 oxidation state exhibits relatively few properties of the transition metals proper from groups 4 to 10, forming rather unstable [[organometallic compound]]s, forming linear complexes showing very low [[coordination number]]s like 2, and forming an amphoteric oxide<ref>Lidin RA 1996, ''Inorganic substances handbook'', begell house, New York, ISBN 1-56700-065-7. p. 5</ref> as well as [[Zintl phase]]s like the [[post-transition metal]]s.<ref>Goodwin F, Guruswamy S, Kainer KU, Kammer C, Knabl W, Koethe A, Leichtfreid G, Schlamp G, Stickler R & Warlimont H 2005, 'Noble metals and noble metal alloys', in ''Springer Handbook of Condensed Matter and Materials Data,'' W Martienssen & H Warlimont (eds), Springer, Berlin, pp.&nbsp;329\u2013406, ISBN 3-540-44376-2. p. 341</ref> Unlike the preceding transition metals, the +1 oxidation state of silver is stable even in the absence of \u03c0-acceptor ligands.<ref name=Greenwood1180/>\n\nSilver does not react with air, even at red heat, and thus was considered by [[alchemist]]s as a [[noble metal]] along with gold. Its reactivity is intermediate between that of copper (which forms [[copper(I) oxide]] when heated in air to red heat) and gold. Like copper, silver reacts with [[sulfur]] and its compounds; in their presence, silver tarnishes in air to form the black [[silver sulfide]] (copper forms the green [[sulfate]] instead, while gold does not react). Unlike copper, silver will not react with the halogens, with the exception of the notoriously reactive [[fluorine]] gas, with which it forms the [[silver(II) fluoride|difluoride]]. While silver is not attacked by non-oxidizing acids, the metal dissolves readily in hot concentrated [[sulfuric acid]], as well as dilute or concentrated [[nitric acid]]. In the presence of air, and especially in the presence of [[hydrogen peroxide]], silver dissolves readily in aqueous solutions of [[cyanide]].<ref name=Greenwood1179>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1179</ref>\n\nSilver metal is attacked by strong oxidizers such as [[potassium permanganate]] ({{chem|KMnO|4}}) and [[potassium dichromate]] ({{chem|K|2|Cr|2|O|7}}), and in the presence of [[potassium bromide]] ({{chem|KBr}}). These compounds are used in photography to [[bleach]] silver images, converting them to silver bromide that can either be fixed with [[thiosulfate]] or redeveloped to [[potassium dichromate#photography|intensify]] the original image.

Silver(III) complexes tend to be rare and very easily reduced to the more stable lower oxidation states, though they are slightly more stable than those of copper(III). For instance, the square planar periodate [Ag(IO<sub>5</sub>OH)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>5\u2212</sup> and tellurate [Ag{TeO<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>}<sub>2</sub>]<sup>5\u2212</suP> complexes may be prepared by oxidising silver(I) with alkaline [[peroxodisulfate]]. The yellow diamagnetic [AgF<sub>4</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup> is much less stable, fuming in moist air and reacting with glass.<ref name=Greenwood1188>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1188</ref>\n\nSilver(II) complexes are more common. Like the valence isoelectronic copper(II) complexes, they are usually square planar and paramagnetic, which is increased by the greater field splitting for 4d electrons than for 3d electrons. Aqueous Ag<sup>2+</sup>, produced by oxidation of Ag<sup>+</sup> by ozone, is a very strong oxidising agent, even in acidic solutions: it is stabilized in [[phosphoric acid]] due to complex formation. Peroxodisulfate oxidation is generally necessary to give the more stable complexes with heterocyclic [[amine]]s, such as [Ag(py)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> and [Ag(bipy)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>: these are stable provided the counterion cannot reduce the silver back to the +1 oxidation state. [AgF<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2\u2212</sup> is also known in its violet barium salt, as are some silver(II) complexes with ''N''- or ''O''-donor ligands such as pyridine carboxylates.<ref name=Greenwood1189>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1189</ref>\n\nHowever, the most important oxidation state for silver in complexes is +1. The Ag<sup>+</sup> cation is diamagnetic, like its homologues Cu<sup>+</sup> and Au<sup>+</sup>: its complexes are colourless provided the ligands are not too easily polarized such as I<sup>\u2212</sup>. Ag<sup>+</sup> forms salts with most anions, but it is reluctant to coordinate to oxygen and thus most of these salts are insoluble in water: the exceptions are the nitrate, perchlorate, and fluoride. The tetracoordinate tetrahedral aqueous ion [Ag(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup> is known, but the characteristic geometry for the Ag<sup>+</sup> cation is 2-coordinate linear. For example, silver chloride dissolves readily in excess aqueous ammonia to form [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>; silver salts are dissolved in photography due to the formation of the thiosulfate complex [Ag(S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>3\u2212</sup>; and [[cyanide]] extraction for silver (and gold) works by the formation of the complex [Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup>. Silver cyanide forms the linear polymer {Ag\u2013C\u2261N\u2192Ag\u2013C\u2261N\u2192}; silver [[thiocyanate]] has a similar structure, but forms a zigzag instead because of the sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized sulfur atom. [[Chelating ligand]]s are unable to form linear complexes and thus silver(I) complexes with them tend to form polymers; a few exceptions exist, such as the near-tetrahedral [[diphosphine]] and [[diarsine]] complexes [Ag(L\u2013L)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>.<ref name=Greenwood1195>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1195\u20136</ref>\n\n====Organometallic====\n{{main|Organosilver chemistry}}\nUnder standard conditions, silver does not form simple carbonyls, due to the weakness of the Ag\u2013C bond. A few are known at very low temperatures around 6\u201315&nbsp;K, such as the green, planar paramagnetic Ag(CO)<sub>3</sub>, which dimerizes at 25\u201330&nbsp;K, probably by forming Ag\u2013Ag bonds. Additionally, the silver carbonyl [Ag(CO)][B(OTeF<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>] is known. Polymeric AgLX complexes with [[alkene]]s and [[alkyne]]s are known, but their bonds are thermodynamically weaker than even those of the [[platinum]] complexes (though they are formed more readily than those of the analogous gold complexes): they are also quite unsymmetrical, showing the weak ''&pi;'' bonding in group 11. Ag\u2013C ''&sigma;'' bonds may also be formed by silver(I), like copper(I) and gold(I), but the simple alkyls and aryls of silver(I) are even less stable than those of copper(I) (which tend to explode under ambient conditions). For example, poor thermal stability is reflected in the relative decomposition temperatures of AgMe (\u221250&nbsp;\u00b0C) and CuMe (\u221215&nbsp;\u00b0C) as well as those of PhAg (74&nbsp;\u00b0C) and PhCu (100&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref name=Greenwood1199>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1199\u2013200</ref>\n\nThe C\u2013Ag bond is stabilized by [[perfluoroalkane|perfluoroalkyl]] ligands, for example in AgCF(CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=\"Miller1968\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja01028a047|last=Miller|first=W.

Later, silver was refined and coined in its pure form. Many nations used silver as the basic unit of monetary value. In the modern world, silver [[bullion]] has the [[ISO 4217|ISO currency code]] XAG. The name of the [[pound sterling]] (\u00a3) reflects the fact it originally represented the value of one pound [[Pound mass#Tower pound|Tower weight]] of sterling silver; the names of other historical currencies, such as the [[French livre]], have similar origins. In some languages, including Sanskrit, Spanish, French, and Hebrew, the word for ''silver'' may be used to mean ''money''.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the [[bimetallism]] that prevailed in most countries was undermined by the discovery of large deposits of silver in the Americas; fearing a sharp decrease in the value of silver and inflation of the currency, most states moved to a [[gold standard]] by 1900.\n\nThe 20th century saw a gradual movement to [[fiat currency]], with most of the world monetary system losing its link to precious metals after the [[United States dollar]] came off the gold standard in 1971; the last currency backed by gold was the [[Swiss franc]], which became a pure fiat currency on 1 May 2000; the issues of 1967 and 1969 (for the 5 franc piece) and 1967 (for the others) were the last Swiss coins minted with silver.<ref>[http://muenzenkatalog.ch Swiss Coin Catalog], edition 2009</ref> In the UK the [[Coins of the pound sterling#Silver content|silver standard]] was reduced from .925 to .500 in 1920. Coins that had been made of silver were changed to cupro-nickel in 1947; existing coins were not withdrawn, but ceased circulating as the silver content came to exceed the face value.

The patented alloy [[Argentium sterling silver]] is formed by the addition of [[germanium]], having improved properties including resistance to [[firescale]].\n\nSterling silver jewelry is often plated with a thin coat of .999-fine silver to create a shiny finish. This process is called \"flashing\". Silver jewelry can also be plated with [[rhodium]] (for a bright shine) or gold ([[silver gilt]]).\n\nSilver is a constituent of almost all [[colored gold|colored carat gold alloys]] and carat gold solders, giving the alloys paler color and greater hardness.<ref name=WGCcolors>{{cite web|url=http://www.utilisegold.com/jewellery_technology/colours/colour_alloys |title=Gold Jewellery Alloys > Utilise Gold.

Unlike [[blacksmiths]], silversmiths do not shape the metal while it is softened with heat, but work it at room temperature with gentle and carefully placed hammer blows. The essence of silversmithing is to transform a piece of flat metal into a useful object with [[hammer]]s, stakes, and other simple tools.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/features/chref/chref.py/main?query=Silversmith&title=21st&sourceid=Mozilla-search|title = Chambers Search Chambers| accessdate = 6 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nWhile silversmiths specialize and work principally in silver, they also work with other [[metal]]s, such as [[gold]], [[copper]], [[steel]], and [[brass]], to make [[jewelry]], [[silver (household)|silverware]], [[armor]], [[vases]], and other artistic items. Because silver is so malleable, silversmiths have many choices for working the metal. Historically, silversmiths are usually called goldsmiths and are usually members of the same [[guild]]. The western Canadian silversmith tradition does not include guilds but mentoring through colleagues is a common method of professional advancement.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://westernhorseman.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=861&Itemid=79|title = Trade Secrets| publisher = Western Horseman Magazine| author= McRae, Kelly| accessdate = 6 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, silversmiths mostly made \"silverware\" ([[cutlery]], [[tableware]], bowls, candlesticks and such).
