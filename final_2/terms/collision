Although the most common colloquial use of the word \"collision\" refers to incidents in which two or more objects collide, the scientific use of the word \"collision\" implies nothing about the magnitude of the force.\n\nSome examples of physical interactions that scientists would consider collisions:\n* An insect touches its antenna to the leaf of a plant.  The antenna is said to collide with leaf.\n* A cat walks delicately through the grass.  Each contact that its paws make with the ground is a collision.  Each brush of its fur against a blade of grass is a collision.\n* When a boxer throws a punch, his fist is said to collide with the opponent's face.\n\nSome colloquial uses of the word collision are:\n* [[traffic collision|automobile collision]], two cars colliding with each other\n* [[mid-air collision]], two planes colliding with each other\n* [[ship collision]], two ships colliding with each other\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Deflection.png|right|thumb|250px|[[Deflection (physics)|Deflection]] happens when an object hits a plane surface.  If the kinetic energy after impact is the same as before impact, it is an elastic collision.  If kinetic energy is lost, it is an inelastic collision. It is not possible to determine from the diagram whether the illustrated collision was elastic or inelastic, because no velocities are provided.  The most one can say is that the collision was not perfectly inelastic, because in that case the ball would have stuck to the wall.]]\nCollision is short-duration interaction between two bodies or more than two bodies simultaneously causing change in motion of bodies involved due to internal forces acted between them during this. Collisions involve forces (there is a change in [[velocity]]).  The magnitude of the velocity difference at impact is called the closing speed.  All collisions conserve [[momentum]].   What distinguishes different types of collisions is whether they also conserve [[kinetic energy]]. The Line of impact is the line which is collinear to the common normal of the surfaces that are closest or in contact during impact. This is the line along which internal force of collision acts during impact, and Newton's coefficient of restitution is defined only along this line.\n\nSpecifically, collisions can either be ''[[elastic collision|elastic]],'' meaning they conserve both momentum and kinetic energy, or ''[[inelastic collision|inelastic]],'' meaning they conserve momentum but not kinetic energy.  An inelastic collision is sometimes also called a ''plastic collision.''\n\nA \u201cperfectly inelastic\u201d collision (also called a \"perfectly plastic\" collision) is a [[limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] of inelastic collision in which the two bodies stick together after impact.\n\nThe degree to which a collision is elastic or inelastic is quantified by the [[coefficient of restitution]], a value that generally ranges between zero and one. A perfectly elastic collision has a coefficient of restitution of one; a perfectly inelastic collision has a coefficient of restitution of zero.\n\n==Types of collisions==\nThere are two types of collisions between two bodies - 1) Head-on collisions or one-dimensional collisions - where the velocity of each body just before impact is along the line of impact, and 2) Non-head-on collisions, oblique collisions or two-dimensional collisions - where the velocity of each body just before impact is not along the line of impact.\n\nAccording to the coefficient of restitution, there are two special cases of any collision as written below:\n\n# A perfectly [[elastic collision]] is defined as one in which there is no loss of [[kinetic energy]] in the collision. In reality, any macroscopic collision between objects will convert some kinetic energy to [[internal energy]] and other forms of energy, so no large-scale impacts are perfectly elastic. However, some problems are sufficiently close to perfectly elastic that they can be approximated as such. In this case, the coefficient of restitution equals one.\n# An [[inelastic collision]] is one in which part of the kinetic energy is changed to some other form of energy in the collision. [[Momentum]] is conserved in inelastic collisions (as it is for elastic collisions), but one cannot track the kinetic energy through the collision since some of it is converted to other forms of energy. In this case, coefficient of restitution does not equal one.\n\nIn any type of collision there is a phase when for a moment colliding bodies have the same velocity along the  line of impact.Then the kinetic energy of bodies reduces to its minimum during this phase and may be called a maximum deformation phase for which momentarily the coefficient of restitution becomes one.\n\nCollisions in [[ideal gases]] approach perfectly elastic collisions, as do scattering interactions of [[sub-atomic particles]] which are deflected by the [[electromagnetic force]]. Some large-scale interactions like the slingshot type gravitational interactions between satellites and planets are perfectly elastic.\n\nCollisions between hard spheres may be nearly elastic, so it is useful to calculate the limiting case of an elastic collision. The assumption of conservation of momentum as well as the conservation of kinetic energy makes possible the calculation of the final velocities in two-body collisions.\n\n==Allision==\nIn maritime law, it is occasionally desirable to distinguish between the situation of a vessel striking a moving object, and that of it striking a stationary object.  The word \"allision\" is then used to mean the striking of a stationary object, while \"collision\" is used to mean the striking of a moving object.<ref>merriam-webster.com, \"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/allision Allision]\".

An important problem in simulating collisions is determining whether two objects have in fact collided.  This problem is called [[collision detection]].\n\n{{cleanup|section|date=February 2011}}\n\n==Examples of collisions that can be solved analytically==\n\n===Billiards===\n{{Anchor|Cue sports}}Collisions play an important role in [[cue sports]].  Because the collisions between [[billiard balls]] are nearly elastic, and the balls roll on a surface that produces low [[rolling friction]], their behavior is often used to illustrate [[Newton's laws of motion]]. After a zero-friction collision of a moving ball with a stationary one of equal mass, the angle between the directions of the two balls is 90 degrees. This is an important fact that professional billiards players take into account,<ref>{{cite web|last=Alciatore |first=David G. |date=January 2006 |url=http://billiards.colostate.edu/technical_proofs/TP_3-1.pdf |title=TP 3.1 90\u00b0 rule |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-03-08 }}</ref> although it assumes the ball is moving frictionlessly across the table rather than rolling with friction.\nConsider an elastic collision in 2 dimensions of any 2 masses m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub>, with respective initial velocities '''u<sub>1</sub>'''  and '''u<sub>2</sub>''' where '''u<sub>2</sub>''' = '''0''', and final velocities '''V<sub>1</sub>''' and '''V<sub>2</sub>'''.\nConservation of momentum gives m<sub>1</sub>'''u'''<sub>1</sub> = m<sub>1'''</sub>V<sub>1</sub>'''+ m<sub>2'''</sub>V<sub>2'''</sub>.\nConservation of energy for an elastic collision gives (1/2)m<sub>1</sub>|'''u<sub>1</sub>'''|<sup>2</sup> = (1/2)m<sub>1</sub>|'''V<sub>1</sub>'''|<sup>2</sup> + (1/2)m<sub>2</sub>|'''V<sub>2</sub>'''|<sup>2</sup>.\nNow consider the case m<sub>1</sub> = m<sub>2</sub>: we obtain '''u<sub>1</sub>'''='''V<sub>1</sub>'''+'''V<sub>2</sub>''' and |'''u<sub>1</sub>'''|<sup>2</sup> = |'''V<sub>1</sub>'''|<sup>2</sup>+|'''V<sub>2</sub>'''|<sup>2</sup>.\nTaking the [[dot product]] of each side of the former equation with itself, |'''u<sub>1</sub>'''|<sup>2</sup> = '''u<sub>1</sub>\u2022u<sub>1</sub>''' = |'''V<sub>1</sub>'''|<sup>2</sup>+|'''V<sub>2</sub>'''|<sup>2</sup>+2'''V<sub>1</sub>\u2022V<sub>2</sub>'''. Comparing this with the latter equation gives '''V<sub>1</sub>\u2022V<sub>2</sub>''' = 0, so they are perpendicular unless '''V<sub>1</sub>''' is the zero vector (which occurs if and only if the collision is head-on).\n\n===Perfectly inelastic collision===\n[[Image:Inelastischer sto\u00df.gif|a completely inelastic collision between equal masses]]\n\nIn a perfectly inelastic collision, i.e., a zero [[coefficient of restitution]], the colliding particles stick together. It is necessary to consider conservation of momentum:\n::<math>m_a \\mathbf u_a + m_b \\mathbf u_b = \\left( m_a + m_b \\right) \\mathbf v \\,</math>\nwhere '''v''' is the final velocity, which is hence given by\n::<math>\\mathbf v=\\frac{m_a \\mathbf u_a + m_b \\mathbf u_b}{m_a + m_b}</math>\nThe reduction of total kinetic energy is equal to the total kinetic energy before the collision in a [[center of momentum frame]] with respect to the system of two particles, because in such a frame the kinetic energy after the collision is zero. In this frame most of the kinetic energy before the collision is that of the particle with the smaller mass. In another frame, in addition to the reduction of kinetic energy there may be a transfer of kinetic energy from one particle to the other; the fact that this depends on the frame shows how relative this is.\nWith time reversed we have the situation of two objects pushed away from each other, e.g. shooting a [[projectile]], or a [[rocket]] applying [[thrust]] (compare the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation#Derivation|derivation of the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]]).\n\n==Examples of collisions analyzed numerically==\n\n===Animal locomotion===\nCollisions of an animal's foot or paw with the underlying substrate are generally termed ground reaction forces. These collisions are inelastic, as kinetic energy is not conserved. An important research topic in [[prosthetics]] is quantifying the forces generated during the foot-ground collisions associated with both disabled and non-disabled gait. This quantification typically requires subjects to walk across a [[force platform]] (sometimes called a \"force plate\") as well as detailed [[kinematic]] and [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] (sometimes termed kinetic) analysis.\n\n==Collisions used as an experimental tool==\nCollisions can be used as an experimental technique to study material properties of objects and other physical phenomena.\n\n===Space exploration===\nAn object may deliberately be made to crash-land on another celestial body, to do measurements and send them to Earth before being destroyed, or to allow instruments elsewhere to observe the effect. See e.g.:\n*During [[Apollo 13]], [[Apollo 14]], [[Apollo 15]], [[Apollo 16]] and [[Apollo 17]], the [[S-IVB]] (the rocket's third stage) was crashed into the [[Moon]] in order to perform seismic measurement used for characterizing the lunar core.\n* [[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|''Deep Impact'']]\n* [[SMART-1]] - [[European Space Agency]] satellite\n* [[Moon impact probe]] - [[ISRO]] probe\n\n===Mathematical description of molecular collisions===\nLet the linear, angular and internal momenta of a molecule be given by the set of ''r'' variables { ''p''<sub>i</sub> }. The state of a molecule may then be described by the range ''\u03b4w''<sub>i</sub> = \u03b4''p''<sub>1</sub>\u03b4''p''<sub>2</sub>\u03b4''p''<sub>3</sub> ... \u03b4''p''<sub>r</sub>. There are many such ranges corresponding to different states; a specific state may be denoted by the index ''i''. Two molecules undergoing a collision can thus be denoted by (''i'', ''j'') (Such an ordered pair is sometimes known as a ''constellation''.)\nIt is convenient to suppose that two molecules exert a negligible effect on each other unless their centre of gravities approach within a critical distance ''b''. A collision therefore begins when the respective centres of gravity arrive at this critical distance, and is completed when they again reach this critical distance on their way apart. Under this model, a collision is completely described by the matrix <math>\\begin{pmatrix}i&j\\\\k&l\\end{pmatrix} </math>, which refers to the constellation (''i'', ''j'') before the collision, and the (in general different) constellation (''k'', ''l'') after the collision.\nThis notation is convenient in proving Boltzmann's [[H-theorem]] of [[statistical mechanics]].\n\n==Attack by means of a deliberate collision==\nTypes of attack by means of a deliberate collision include:\n* striking with the body: unarmed [[Strike (attack)|striking]], [[Punch (strike)|punching]], [[kick]]ing\n* striking with a weapon, such as a [[sword]], [[club (weapon)|club]] or [[axe]]\n* [[ramming]] with an object or vehicle, e.g.:\n** a car deliberately crashing into a building to break into it\n** a [[battering ram]], medieval weapon used for breaking down large doors, also a modern version is used by police forces during raids\nAn attacking collision with a distant object can be achieved by throwing or launching a [[projectile]].\n\n==See also==\n{{multicol}}\n*[[Ballistic pendulum]]\n*[[Car accident]]\n*[[Coefficient of restitution]]\n*[[Collision (telecommunications)]]\n*[[Collision detection]]\n*[[Elastic collision]]\n*[[Friction]]\n*[[Head-on collision]]\n*[[Impact crater]]\n{{multicol-break}}\n*[[Impact event]]\n*[[Inelastic collision]]\n*[[Kinetic theory of gases|Kinetic theory]]<br /> - collisions between [[molecule]]s\n*[[Mid-air collision]]\n*[[Projectile]]\n*[[Satellite collision]]\n*[[Space debris]]\n*[[Train wreck]]\n{{multicol-end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|1}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | author=Tolman, R.
