It has been known since ancient times. Silica is most commonly found in nature as  [[quartz]], as well as in various living organisms.<ref>{{cite book|author=Iler, R.

Silica is one of the most complex and most abundant families of materials, existing both as several minerals and being produced synthetically.   Notable examples include [[fused quartz]], [[crystal]], [[fumed silica]], [[silica gel]], and [[aerogel]]s.  Applications range from structural materials  to microelectronics to components used in the food industry.\n\n==Production==\nSilicon dioxide is mostly obtained by mining and purification of [[quartz]].  Quartz comprises more than 10% by mass of the earth's crust.<ref name=Ull/> This product is suitable for many purposes while for others chemical processing is required to make a purer or otherwise more suitable (e.g. more reactive or fine-grained) product.\n\n===Fumed silica===\n{{main article|Fumed silica}}\nPyrogenic silica (sometimes called fumed silica or silica fume) is a very fine particulate or [[colloid]]al form of silicon dioxide.  It is prepared by burning [[silicon tetrachloride|SiCl<sub>4</sub>]] in an oxygen rich hydrocarbon flame to produce a \"smoke\" of SiO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=\"Greenwood\">{{Greenwood&Earnshaw1st|pages=393\u201399}}</ref>\n:SiCl<sub>4</sub>  +  2 H<sub>2</sub>  +  O<sub>2</sub>  \u2192   SiO<sub>2</sub>  +  4 HCl.\n\n===Silica fume===\n{{main article|Silica fume}}\nThis product is obtained as byproduct from hot processes like ferro-silicon production. It is less pure than fumed silica and should not be confused with that product. The production process, particle characteristics and fields of application of fumed silica are all different from those of silica fume.\n\n===Precipitated silica===\n{{main article|Precipitated silica}}\nAmorphous silica, silica gel, is produced by the acidification of solutions of [[sodium silicate]].  The gelatinous precipitate is first washed and then dehydrated to produce colorless microporous silica.<ref name=\"Greenwood\"/>  Idealized equation involving a trisilicate and [[sulfuric acid]] is shown:\n:Na<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>  +  H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>   \u2192   3 SiO<sub>2</sub>  +  Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>  +  H<sub>2</sub>O\nApproximately one billion kilograms/year (1999) of silica was produced in this manner, mainly for use for polymer composites \u2013 tires and shoe soles.<ref name=Ull/>\n\n===On microchips===\nThin films of silica grow spontaneously on silicon wafers via [[thermal oxidation]].

In electrical applications, it can protect the silicon, store charge, block current, and even act as a controlled pathway to limit current flow.<ref>Riordan, Michael (2007) [http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/design/the-silicon-dioxide-solution \"The Silicon Dioxide Solution: How physicist Jean Hoerni built the bridge from the transistor to the integrated circuit\"] [[IEEE Spectrum]].</ref>\n\n===Laboratory or special methods===\n\n====From silicate esters====\nMany routes to silicon dioxide start with silicate esters, the best known being [[tetraethyl orthosilicate]] (TEOS).  Simply heating TEOS at 680\u2013730&nbsp;\u00b0C gives the dioxide:\n::Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>   \u2192   SiO<sub>2</sub>  +  2 O(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\n\nSimilarly TEOS combusts around 400&nbsp;\u00b0C:\n::Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub> + 12 O<sub>2</sub>   \u2192   SiO<sub>2</sub> + 10 H<sub>2</sub>O  +  8 CO<sub>2</sub>\n\nTEOS undergoes [[hydrolysis]] via the so-called [[sol-gel process]].

Conceptually simple, but of little practical value, combustion of [[silane]] gives silicon dioxide.  This reaction is analogous to the combustion of methane:\n::SiH<sub>4</sub> + 2 O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 SiO<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O.\n\n==Uses==\nAn estimated 95% of silicon dioxide produced is consumed in the construction industry, e.g. for the production of [[Portland cement]].<ref name=Ull/>  Other major applications are listed below.\n\n===Precursor to glass and silicon===\nSilica is used primarily in the production of [[glass]] for windows, drinking glasses, beverage bottles, and many other uses. The majority of [[optical fiber]]s for [[telecommunication]] are also made from silica. It is a primary raw material for many ceramics such as [[earthenware]], [[stoneware]], and [[porcelain]].\n\nSilicon dioxide is used to produce elemental [[silicon]]. The process involves [[carbothermic reduction]] in an [[electric arc furnace]]:<ref>Shriver and Atkins. Inorganic Chemistry (5th Edition). [[W. H.

The high melting point of silica enables it to be used in such applications.\n\n===Food and pharmaceutical applications===\nSilica is a common additive in the production of foods, where it is used primarily as a flow agent in powdered foods, or to adsorb water in [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] applications. It is the primary component of [[diatomaceous earth]].  [[Colloid]]al silica is also used as a wine, beer, and juice [[fining agent (wine)|fining agent]].<ref name=Ull>Fl\u00f6rke, Otto W. et al. (2008) \"Silica\" in  ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Weinheim: Wiley-VCH, . {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a23_583.pub3}}.</ref>\n\nIn pharmaceutical products, silica aids powder flow when tablets are formed.\n\n===Other===\nA silica-based aerogel was used in the [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust spacecraft]] to collect extraterrestrial particles. Silica is also used in the extraction of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] due to its ability to bind to the nucleic acids under the presence of [[chaotropic agent|chaotropes]]. [[Hydrophobic silica]] is used as a [[anti-foaming agent|defoamer component]]. In [[hydrated silica|hydrated form]], it is used in [[toothpaste]] as a hard abrasive to remove tooth plaque.\n\nIn its capacity as a refractory, it is useful in fiber form as a high-temperature thermal protection fabric. In cosmetics, it is useful for its light-diffusing properties and natural absorbency. It is also used as a thermal enhancement compound in [[ground source heat pump]] industry.\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:SiO2repeat.png|thumb|left|150px|Structural motif found in \u03b1-quartz, but also found in almost all forms of silicon dioxide.]]\nIn the majority of [[silicate]]s, the Si atom shows tetrahedral coordination, with 4 oxygen atoms surrounding a central Si atom. The most common example is seen in the quartz crystalline form of silica SiO<sub>2</sub>. In each of the most [[thermodynamic]]ally stable crystalline forms of silica, on average, all 4 of the vertices (or oxygen atoms) of the SiO<sub>4</sub> [[tetrahedra]] are shared with others, yielding the net chemical formula: SiO<sub>2</sub>.\n\n[[File:Quartzrn.PNG|thumb|Relation between refractive index and density for some SiO<sub>2</sub> forms.<ref name=mel/>]]\n\nFor example, in the unit cell of \u03b1-quartz, the central tetrahedron shares all 4 of its corner O atoms, the 2 face-centered tetrahedra share 2 of their corner O atoms, and the 4 edge-centered tetrahedra share just one of their O atoms with other SiO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra. This leaves a net average of 12 out of 24 total vertices for that portion of the 7 SiO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra that are considered to be a part of the unit cell for silica ([http://www.mindat.org/min-3337.html see 3-D Unit Cell]).\n\nSiO<sub>2</sub> has a number of distinct crystalline forms ([[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]s) in addition to amorphous forms. With the exception of [[stishovite]] and fibrous silica, all of the crystalline forms involve tetrahedral SiO<sub>4</sub> units linked together by shared vertices in different arrangements. Silicon\u2013oxygen bond lengths vary between the different crystal forms, for example in \u03b1-quartz the bond length is 161 pm, whereas in \u03b1-tridymite it is in the range 154\u2013171 pm. The Si-O-Si angle also varies between a low value of 140\u00b0 in \u03b1-tridymite, up to 180\u00b0 in \u03b2-tridymite. In \u03b1-quartz the Si-O-Si angle is 144\u00b0.<ref name=\"Wiberg&Holleman\"/>\n\nFibrous silica has a structure similar to that of [[Silicon sulfide|SiS<sub>2</sub>]] with chains of edge-sharing SiO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra. Stishovite, the higher-pressure form, in contrast has a [[rutile]]-like structure where silicon is 6-coordinate. The density of stishovite is 4.287&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, which compares to \u03b1-quartz, the densest of the low-pressure forms, which has a density of 2.648&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>.<ref name = \"Greenwood\"/> The difference in density can be ascribed to the increase in coordination as the six shortest Si-O bond lengths in stishovite (four Si-O bond lengths of 176 pm and two others of 181 pm) are greater than the Si-O bond length (161 pm) in \u03b1-quartz.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wells A. F. |year=1984|title=Structural Inorganic Chemistry |publisher=Oxford Science Publications|isbn=0-19-855370-6}}</ref>\nThe change in the coordination increases the ionicity of the Si-O bond.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1107/S0108767301010698|title=Electron-density distribution in stishovite, SiO<sub>2</sub>: a new high-energy synchrotron-radiation study|year=2001|author=Kirfel, A.|journal=[[Acta Crystallographica A]] |volume=57|page=663|last2=Krane|first2=H. G.|last3=Blaha|first3=P.|last4=Schwarz|first4=K.|last5=Lippmann|first5=T.|issue=6}}</ref> But more important is the observation that any deviations from these standard parameters constitute microstructural differences or variations, which represent an approach to an [[amorphous solid|amorphous]], vitreous or glassy solid.\n\nThe only stable form under normal conditions is \u03b1-quartz and this is the form in which crystalline silicon dioxide is usually encountered. In nature impurities in crystalline \u03b1-quartz can give rise to colors (see list).  The high temperature minerals, cristobalite and tridymite, have both a lower density and index of refraction than quartz. Since the composition is identical, the reason for the discrepancies must be in the increased spacing in the high temperature minerals. As is common with many substances, the higher the temperature the farther apart the atoms due to the increased vibration energy.\n\nThe transformation from \u03b1-quartz to beta-quartz takes place abruptly at 573&nbsp;\u00b0C. Since the transformation is accompanied by a significant change in volume it can easily induce fracturing of ceramics or rocks passing through this temperature limit.\n\nThe high-pressure minerals, [[seifertite]], [[stishovite]], and [[coesite]], on the other hand, have a higher density and index of refraction when compared to quartz. This is probably due to the intense compression of the atoms that must occur during their formation, resulting in a more condensed structure.\n\nFaujasite silica is another form of crystalline silica. It is obtained by dealumination of a low-sodium, ultra-stable Y zeolite with a combined acid and thermal treatment. The resulting product contains over 99% silica, has high crystallinity and high surface area (over 800 m<sup>2</sup>/g). Faujasite-silica has very high thermal and acid stability. For example, it maintains a high degree of long-range molecular order (or crystallinity) even after boiling in concentrated hydrochloric acid.<ref name=fau>{{cite journal|author=Scherzer, J. |title=Dealuminated faujasite-type structures with SiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ratios over 100|journal=[[Journal of Catalysis]] |volume=54|page=285|year=1978|doi=10.1016/0021-9517(78)90051-9|issue=2}}</ref>\n\nMolten silica exhibits several peculiar physical characteristics that are similar to the ones observed in liquid [[water (properties)|water]]: negative temperature expansion, density maximum (at temperatures ~5000&nbsp;\u00b0C), and a heat capacity minimum.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.engr.ucsb.edu/~shell/papers/2002_PRE_silica.pdf|last=Shell|first=Scott M. |author2=Debenedetti, Pablo G. |author3=Panagiotopoulos, Athanassios Z. |title=Molecular structural order and anomalies in liquid silica|journal=[[Physical Review E]] |year=2002 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.66.011202 |volume=66 |page=011202 |bibcode=2002PhRvE..66a1202S| arxiv = cond-mat/0203383 }}</ref> Its density decreases from 2.08&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup> at 1950&nbsp;\u00b0C to 2.03&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup> at 2200&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~cml/assets/pdf/7962aksay.pdf |title=Densities of SiO<sub>2</sub>-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> Melts |doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1979.tb19071.x |journal=[[Journal of the American Ceramic Society]] |volume =62 |issue =7\u20138 |pages =332\u2013336 |year=1979 |author1=Aksay, I.

The difference between the glass and the crystalline forms arise from the connectivity of these tetrahedral units.

Plant materials with high silica phytolith content appear to be of importance to grazing animals, from chewing insects to ungulates. Studies have shown that it accelerates tooth wear, and high levels of silica in plants frequently eaten by herbivores may have developed as a defense mechanism against predation.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2656.2006.01082.x |title=Silica in grasses as a defence against insect herbivores: Contrasting effects on folivores and a phloem feeder |year=2006 |last1=Massey |first1=Fergus P. |last2=Ennos |first2=A.

In the modern world it occurs in bacteria, single-celled organisms, plants, and animals (invertebrates and vertebrates).\nProminent examples include:\n*[[Test (biology)|Tests]] or [[frustule]]s (i.e. shells) of [[diatom]]s, [[Radiolaria]] and testate amoebae.<ref name=Fern/>\n*Silica [[phytolith]]s in the cells of many plants, including [[Equisetaceae]], practically all grasses, and a wide range of [[dicotyledon]]s.\n*The spicules forming the skeleton of many [[sponge]]s.\n\nCrystalline minerals formed in the physiological environment often show exceptional physical properties (e.g., strength, hardness, fracture toughness) and tend to form hierarchical structures that exhibit microstructural order over a range of scales. The minerals are crystallized from an environment that is undersaturated with respect to silicon, and under conditions of neutral pH and low temperature (0\u201340&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\nFormation of the mineral may occur either within the cell wall of an organism (such as with phytoliths), or outside the cell wall, as typically happens with tests.{{clarify|reason=what are tests, and where might one find them?|date=February 2016}} Specific biochemical reactions exist for mineral deposition. Such reactions include those that involve lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates.\n\nIt is unclear in what ways silica is important in the nutrition of [[animals]]. This field of research is challenging because silica is ubiquitous  and in most circumstances dissolves in trace quantities only. All the same it certainly does occur in the living body, leaving us with the problem that it is hard to create proper silica-free controls for purposes of research. This makes it difficult to be sure when the silica present has had operative beneficial effects, and when its presence is coincidental, or even harmful. The current consensus is that it certainly seems important in the growth, strength, and management of many connective tissues. This is true not only for hard connective tissues such as bone and tooth but possibly in the biochemistry of the subcellular enzyme-containing structures as well.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=3743227|year=1986|last1=Carlisle|first1=EM|title=Silicon as an essential trace element in animal nutrition|volume=121|pages=123\u201339|journal=Ciba Foundation Symposium|doi=10.1002/9780470513323.ch8|series=Novartis Foundation Symposia|isbn=978-0-470-51332-3}}</ref>\n\n==Health effects==\n[[File:Piasek kwarcowy.jpg|thumb|Quartz sand (silica) as main raw material for commercial glass production]]\nSilica ingested orally is essentially nontoxic, with an {{LD50}} of 5000&nbsp;mg/kg (5&nbsp;g/kg).<ref name=Ull/>  On the other hand, inhaling finely divided crystalline silica dust can lead to [[silicosis]], [[bronchitis]], or [[cancer]], as the dust becomes lodged in the lungs and continuously irritates them, reducing lung capacities.<ref>CPWR-Center for Construction Research and Training&nbsp;\u2014 Work Safely with Silica: [http://www.silica-safe.org \"What are the Health Effects?]</ref> Studies of workers with exposure to crystalline silica have shown 10-fold higher than expected rates of [[lupus]] and other [[systemic autoimmune disease]]s compared to expected rates in the general population.<ref>[http://www.niams.nih.gov/about_us/Mission_and_Purpose/lupus_plan.asp The Future Directions of Lupus Research]. niams.nih.gov</ref> Prior to new rules issued in 2013, [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] allowed 100 [[micrograms|\u00b5g]] per cubic meter of air.
