Retrieved on July 12, 2010.</ref> NEC provides IT and network solutions to business enterprises, communications services providers and to government agencies, and has also been the biggest PC vendor in Japan since the 1980s. The company was known as the '''[[Nippon]] Electric Company, Limited''', before [[rebranding]] in 1983 as just NEC.  Its NEC Semiconductors business unit was one of the [[Semiconductor sales leaders by year|worldwide top 20 semiconductor sales leaders]] before merging with [[Renesas Electronics]].  NEC is a member of the [[Sumitomo Group]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1898 to 1919===\n[[Kunihiko Iwadare]] and [[Takeshiro Maeda]] established Nippon Electric Limited Partnership on August 31, 1898 by using facilities that they had bought from Miyoshi Electrical Manufacturing Company.  Iwadare acted as the representative partner;  Maeda handled company sales.  [[Western Electric]], which had an interest in the Japanese phone market, was represented by [[Walter Tenney Carleton]].<ref>Mason 1987, p. 94.</ref>  Carleton was also responsible for the renovation of the Miyoshi facilities.<ref>NEC 1984, p. 6.</ref>  It was agreed that the partnership would be reorganized as a joint-stock company when treaty would allow it.  On July 17, 1899, the revised treaty between Japan and the United States went into effect.  Nippon Electric Company, Limited was organized the same day with Western Electric Company to become the first Japanese [[joint-venture]] with foreign capital.<ref>Mason 1987, p. 95.</ref>  Iwadare was named managing director.  Ernest Clement and Carleton were named as directors.  Maeda and Mototeru Fujii were assigned to be auditors.  Iwadare, Maeda and Carleton handled the overall management.<ref>\nNEC 1984, p. 8.</ref>\n\nThe company started with the production, sales and maintenance of telephones and [[switch]]es.  NEC modernized the production facilities with the construction of the Mita Plant in 1901 at [[Mita Shikokumachi]].  It was completed in December 1902.\n\nThe Japanese [[Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications|Ministry of Communications]] adopted a new technology in 1903: the common battery [[Telephone switchboard|switchboard]] supplied by NEC.  The common battery switchboards powered the subscriber phone, eliminating the need for a permanent magnet generator in each subscriber's phone.  The switchboards were initially imported, but were manufactured locally by 1909.<ref>{{cite web|title=history|url=http://www.nec.com/en/global/about/history.html|website=nec|accessdate=10 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nNEC started exporting [[History of the telephone|telephone sets]] to China in 1904.\n\nIn 1905, [[Kunihiko Iwadare|Iwadare]] visited Western Electric in the U.S. to see their management and production control.  On his return to Japan he discontinued the \"oyakata\" system of sub-contracting and replaced it with a new system where managers and employees were all direct employees of the company.  Inefficiency was also removed from the production process.  The company paid higher salaries with incentives for efficiency.  New accounting and cost controls were put in place, and time clocks installed.<ref>NEC 1984, p. 9</ref>\n\nBetween 1899 and 1907 the number of telephone subscribers in Japan rose from 35,000 to 95,000.<ref>NEC 1984, p. 12.</ref>  NEC entered the China market in 1908 with the implementation of the telegraph treaty between Japan and China.  They also entered the Korean market, setting up an office in Seoul in January 1908.  During the period of 1907 to 1912 sales rose from 1.6 million yen to 2 million yen.  The expansion of the Japanese phone service had been a key part of NEC's success during this period.  This expansion was about to take a pause.\n\nThe Ministry of Communications delayed a third expansion plan of the phone service in March, 1913, despite having 120,000 potential telephone-subscribers waiting for phone installations.  NEC sales fell sixty percent between 1912 and 1915.  During the interim, Iwadare started importing appliances, including electric fans, kitchen appliances, washing machines and vacuum cleaners.  Electric fans had never been seen in Japan before.  The imports were intended to prop up company sales.  In 1916, the government resumed the delayed telephone-expansion plan, adding 75,000 subscribers and 326,000 kilometers of new toll lines.  Thanks to this third expansion plan, NEC expanded at a time when much of the rest of Japanese industry contracted.<ref>NEC 1984, p. 15.</ref>\n\n===1919 to 1938===\nIn 1919, NEC started its first association with [[Sumitomo Group|Sumitomo]], engaging Sumitomo Densen Seizosho  to manufacture cables.  As part of the venture, NEC provided cable manufacturing equipment to Sumitomo Densen.  Rights to Western Electrics duplex cable patents were also transferred to Sumitomo Densen.<ref>NEC 1984, p. 17</ref>\n\nThe [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|Great Kant\u014d earthquake]] struck Japan in 1923.  140,000 people were killed and 3.4 million were left homeless.<ref>NEC 1984, p. 18.</ref>  Four of NEC's factories were destroyed, killing 105 of NEC's engineers and workers.  Thirteen of Tokyo's telephone offices were destroyed by fire.  Telephone and telegraph service was interrupted by damage to telephone cables.  In response, the Ministry of Communications accelerated major programs to install automatic telephone switching systems and enter radio broadcasting.<ref>NEC 1984, p. 19</ref>  The first automatic switching systems were the [[Strowger switch|Strowger]]-type model made by Automatic Telephone Manufacturing Co. (ATM) in the United Kingdom.  NEC participated in the installation of the automatic switching systems, ultimately becoming the general sales agent for ATM.  NEC developed its own Strowger-type automatic switching system in 1924, a first in Japan.  One of the plants almost leveled during the Kanto earthquake, the Mita Plant, was chosen to support expanding production.  A new three-story steel-reinforced concrete building was built, starting in 1925.  It was modeled after the [[Western Electric]] [[Hawthorne Works]].\n\nNEC started its radio communications business in 1924.  Japan's first radio broadcaster, Radio Tokyo was founded in 1924 and started broadcasting in 1925.  NEC imported the broadcasting equipment from Western Electric.<ref>NEC 1984, p. 20</ref>  The expansion of radio broadcasting into Osaka and Nagoya marked the emergence of radio as an Industry.  NEC established a radio research unit 1924.  NEC started developing electron tubes in 1925.  By 1930, they were manufacturing their first 500 W radio transmitter.  They provided the Chinese Xinjing station with a 100&nbsp;kW radio broadcasting system in 1934.\n\nPhoto-telegraphic equipment developed by NEC transmitted photos of the accession ceremony of Emperor [[Hirohito]]. The ceremony was held in [[Kyoto]] in 1928. The Newspapers [[Asahi Shimbun]] and [[Mainichi Shimbun]] were competing to cover the ceremony. The Asahi Shimbun was using a [[Siemens]] device. The Mainichi was planning to use French photo-telegraphic equipment. In the end, both papers acquired and used the NEC product, due to its faster transmission rate and higher picture quality.<ref>NEC 1984, p. 22.</ref>\n\nIn 1929 Nippon Electric provided Japan's Ministry of Communications with the A-type switching system, the first of these systems to be developed in Japan.  Nippon supplied Japan's Ministry of Communications with nonloaded line carrier equipment for long distance telephone channels in 1937.<ref>NEC 1984, p. 22</ref>\n\n===1938 to 1945===\n[[World War II]] was described by the company as being the blackest days of its history.<ref>NEC 1984, p. 31.</ref>  In 1938 the Mita and Tamagawa plants were placed under military control, with direct supervision by military officers. In 1939, Nippon Electric established a research laboratory in the Tamagawa plant.  It became the first Japanese company to successfully test microwave multiplex communications.<ref>NEC 1984, p. 30</ref>  On December 22, 1941, the enemy property control law was passed.  NEC shares owned by International Standard Electric Corporation (ISE), an [[ITT Corporation|ITT]] subsidiary and Western Electric affiliate were seized.  Capital and technical relations were abruptly severed.  The \"Munitions Company Law\" was passed in October 1943, placing overall control of NEC plants under military jurisdiction.<ref>NEC 1984, p. 30.</ref>  The Ueno plant was leveled by military attack in March 1945.  Fire bombings in April and May heavily damaged the Tamagawa Plant, reducing its capacity by forty percent.  The Okayama Plant was totally destroyed by a bombing attack in June of the same year.  At the end of the war, NEC\u2019s production had been substantially reduced by damage to its facilities, and by material and personnel shortages.\n\n===1945 to 1980===\nAfter the war, production was slowly returned to civilian use.  NEC re-opened its major plants by the end of January 1946.<ref>NEC 1984, p. 35.</ref> NEC began transistor research and development in 1950.  It started exporting radio-broadcast equipment to Korea under the first major postwar contract in 1951.  NEC received the [[Deming Prize]] for excellence in quality control in 1952.  Computer research and development began in 1954.  NEC produced the first [[crossbar switch]]ing system in Japan.  It was installed at Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation (currently [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation]]; NTT) in 1956.  NEC began joint research and development with NTT of electronic switching systems the same year.  NEC established Taiwan Telecommunication Company as their first postwar overseas joint venture in 1958.  They completed the NEAC-1101 and NEAC-1102 computers the same year.  In 1959 NEC demonstrated their first transistorized computer, the NEAC-2201.  They demonstrated it at the UNESCO AUTOMATH show in Paris.  The company began integrated circuit research and development in 1960.  In 1963 NEC started trading as American Depositary Receipts, ten million shares being sold in the United States.<ref>NEC 1984, p. 46</ref>  Nippon Electric New York (now NEC America Inc.) was incorporated in the same year.\n\n[[File:Classic_NEC_logo.png|right|thumb|200px|The NEC logo from 1963 to 1992<ref>NEC 1984, p. 46.</ref>]]\n\nNEC supplied KDD with submarine cable systems for laying in the Pacific Ocean in 1964.  They supplied short-haul 24 channel PCM carrier transmission equipment to NTT in 1965.  NEC de Mexico, S. A. de C. V., NEC do Brasil, S. A., NEC Australia Pty. Ltd. were established between 1968 and 1969.  NEC supplied Comsat Corporation with the SPADE satellite communications system in 1971.  In 1972, Switzerland ordered a NEC satellite communications earth station.  The same year, a small transportable satellite communications earth station was set up in China.  Shares of NEC common stock were listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in 1973.  NEC also designed an automated broadcasting system for the Japan Broadcasting Corporation the same year.  NEC Electronics (Europe) GmbH was also established.  In 1974, the ACOS series computer was introduced.  The New Central Research Laboratories were completed in 1975.  In 1977, Japan's National Space Development Agency launched the NEC [[geostationary meteorological satellite]], named [[Himawari (satellite)|Himawari]].\n\nDuring this period NEC introduced the concept of \"C&C\", the integration of computers and communications.  NEC America Inc. opened a plant in [[Dallas, Texas]] to manufacture [[PABX]] and telephone systems in 1978.  They also acquired [[Electronic Arrays, Inc]]. of [[California]] the same year to start semiconductor chip production in the United States.\n\n===1980 to 2000===\n[[File:NEC APC.jpg|thumb|200px|A 1982 NEC APC microcomputer]]\n\nIn 1980, NEC created the first [[digital signal processor]], the [[NEC \u00b5PD7710]].  NEC Semiconductors (UK) Ltd. was established in 1981, producing [[Very-large-scale integration|VLSI]]s and LSIs.  NEC introduced the 8-bit [[NEC PC-8801|PC-8800]] series personal computer in 1981, followed by the 16-bit [[NEC PC-9801|PC-9800]] series in 1982. In 1983 NEC stock was listed on the Basel, Geneva and Zurich, Switzerland exchanges. NEC quickly became the dominant leader of the Japanese PC industry, holding 80% market share.<ref>Page 211, Inventing the Electronic Century: The Epic Story of the Consumer Electronics and Computer Industries, with a new preface by [[Alfred Dupont]] CHANDLER, Takashi Hikino, Andrew Von Nordenflycht, Alfred D Chandler, ISBN 0674029399, 9780674029392</ref> NEC changed its English company name to NEC Corporation the same year.  [[NEC Information Systems, Inc]]. started manufacturing computers and related products in the United States in 1984.  NEC also released the [[V-series processor]] the same year.  In 1986, NEC delivered its [[SX-2]] super computer to the [[Houston Advanced Research Center]], [[The Woodlands, Texas]].  In the same year, the [[NEAX61]] digital switching system went in to service.  In 1987, NEC Technologies (UK) Ltd. was established in the United Kingdom to manufacture [[VCR]]s, printers and [[computer monitor]]s and mobile telephones for Europe.  Also that year, NEC licensed technology from [[Hudson Soft]], a video game manufacturer, to create a video game console called the [[PC-Engine]] (later released in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 in the North American market). Its successor, the [[PC-FX]], was released in Japan in 1994. While the PC-Engine achieved a considerable following, it has been said that NEC held a much stronger influence on the video game industry through its role as a leading semiconductor manufacturer than through any of its direct video game products.<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=75 Power Players|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=11|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=November 1995|page=56|quote=But NEC's influence stretches far above and beyond its immediate videogame products. As a leading semiconductor manufacturer, the company's influence is there from the cradle to the grave of every aspect of computing.}}</ref> NEC USA, Inc. was established in 1989 as a holding company for North American operations.\n\nIn 1990, the new head office building, known as the \"[[NEC Supertower|Super Tower]]\", was completed in [[Shiba, Tokyo]]. Additionally, joint-venture agreements were established to manufacture and market digital electronic switching systems and LSIs in China. In 1993 NEC's asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switching system, the [[NEAX61]] (Nippon Electronic Automatic Exchange) ATM Service Node, went into service in the United States.  NEC Europe, Ltd. was established as a holding company for European operations the same year.  The NEC C&C Research Laboratories, NEC Europe, Ltd. were opened in Germany in 1994.  NEC (China) Co, Ltd. was established as a holding company for Chinese operations in 1996.  In 1997 NEC developed 4Gbit DRAM, and their semiconductor group was honored with one of the first Japan Quality Awards. In 1998, NEC opened the world's most advanced semiconductor [[R&D]] facility.\n\n[[File:NEC Mobile Gear II MCR330.jpg|thumb|200px|NEC Mobile Gear II MC/R330 handheld computer running Windows CE 2.0 (Japanese market, 1998)]]\n\nNEC had been the no. 1 personal computer vendor in Japan during the 1980s, but it faced increasing competition from [[Fujitsu]], [[Seiko Epson]] and [[IBM Japan Ltd|IBM Japan]]. Nevertheless, by the early 1990s NEC was still the largest, having well over 50% market share in the Japanese market. Competition heated up later as rival Fujitsu started to aggressively market its computers, which were industry standard ([[x86]]) instead of NEC's. By 1997 NEC's share was reduced to about 35%.<ref>http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/nec-faces-tough-market-in-japan/</ref>\n\n===2000 to present===\n[[File:Kaoru Yano cropped 2 Kaoru Yano and Sebastian Pinera 20101115.jpg|thumb|160px|Kaoru Yano, the previous chairman of NEC]]\n\nNEC celebrated their 100th anniversary in 1999. [[NEC Electronics]] Corporation was separated from NEC in 2002 as a new semiconductor company. NEC Laboratories America, Inc. (NEC Labs) started in November, 2002 as a merger of NEC Research Institute (NECI) and NEC USA\u2019s Computer and Communications Research Laboratory (CCRL).  NEC built the [[Earth Simulator]] Computer (ESC), the fastest [[supercomputer]] in the world from 2002 to 2004, and since produced the [[NEC N343i]] in 2006.\n\nIn 2003 NEC had a 20.8% market share in the personal computer market in Japan, slightly ahead of Fujitsu.<ref>Page 110, Industrial Development in Postwar Japan by Hirohisa Kohama, ISBN 978-0415437073</ref>\n\nIn 2007, NEC and [[Nissan Motors|Nissan]] Co.
