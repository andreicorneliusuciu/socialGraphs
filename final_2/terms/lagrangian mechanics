Newton's laws can include non-[[conservative force]]s like [[friction]]; however, they must include constraint forces explicitly and are best suited to [[Cartesian coordinates]]. Lagrangian mechanics is ideal for systems with conservative forces and for bypassing constraint forces in any [[coordinate system]]. Dissipative and driven forces can be accounted for by splitting the external forces into a sum of potential and non-potential forces, leading to a set of modified [[Euler-Lagrange]] (EL) equations.<ref>{{harvnb|Jose|Saletan|page=129}}</ref> Generalized coordinates can be chosen by convenience, to exploit symmetries in the system or the geometry of the constraints, which may simplify solving for the motion of the system. Lagrangian mechanics also reveals conserved quantities and their symmetries in a direct way, as a special case of [[Noether's theorem]].\n\nLagrangian mechanics is important not just for its broad applications, but also for its role in advancing deep understanding of [[physics]]. Although Lagrange only sought to describe [[classical mechanics]] in his treatise ''[[M\u00e9canique analytique]]'',<ref>{{harvnb|Lagrange|1811}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lagrange|1815}}</ref> ''[[Hamilton's principle]]'' that can be used to derive the Lagrange equation was later recognized to be applicable to much of fundamental [[theoretical physics]] as well, particularly [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[theory of relativity]]. It can also be applied to other systems ''by analogy'', for instance to coupled [[electric circuit]]s with [[inductance]]s and [[capacitance]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Goldtein|1980}}</ref>\n\nLagrangian mechanics is widely used to solve mechanical problems in physics and [[engineering]] when [[Newtonian mechanics|Newton's formulation]] of classical mechanics is not convenient. Lagrangian mechanics applies to the dynamics of particles, [[field (physics)|field]]s are described using a [[Lagrangian density]]. Lagrange's equations are also used in optimisation problems of dynamic systems. In mechanics, Lagrange's equations of the second kind are used much more than those of the first kind.\n\n==Introduction==\n\n[[File:Bead on wire constraint.svg|thumb|200px|Bead constrained to move on a frictionless wire. The wire exerts a reaction force '''C''' on the bead to keep it on the wire. The non-constraint force '''N''' in this case is gravity. Notice the initial position of the wire can lead to different motions.]]\n[[File:Pendulum constraint.svg|150px|thumb|Simple pendulum. Since the rod is rigid, the position of the bob is constrained according to the equation ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = 0, the constraint force '''C''' is the tension in the rod. Again the non-constraint force '''N''' in this case is gravity.]]\n\nSuppose we have a bead sliding around on a wire, or a swinging [[simple pendulum]], etc. If one tracks each of the massive objects (bead, pendulum bob, etc.) as a particle, calculation of the motion of the particle using [[Newtonian mechanics]] would require solving for the time-varying constraint force required to keep the particle in the constrained motion (reaction force exerted by the wire on the bead, or [[Tension (physics)|tension]] in the pendulum rod). For the same problem using Lagrangian mechanics, one looks at the path the particle can take and chooses a convenient set of ''independent'' [[generalized coordinate]]s that completely characterize the possible motion of the particle. This choice eliminates the need for the constraint force to enter into the resultant system of equations. There are fewer equations since one is not directly calculating the influence of the constraint on the particle at a given moment.\n\nFor a wide variety of physical systems, if the size and shape of a massive object are negligible, it is a useful simplification to treat it as a [[point particle]]. For a system of ''N'' point particles with [[mass]]es ''m''<sub>1</sub>, ''m''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''m<sub>N</sub>'', each particle has a [[position vector]], denoted '''r'''<sub>1</sub>, '''r'''<sub>2</sub>, ... '''r'''<sub>''N''</sub>. [[Cartesian coordinates]] are often sufficient, so '''r'''<sub>1</sub> = (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>, ''z''<sub>1</sub>), '''r'''<sub>2</sub> = (''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''y''<sub>2</sub>, ''z''<sub>2</sub>) and so on. In [[three dimensional space]], each position vector requires three [[coordinate vector|coordinates]] to uniquely define the location of a point, so there are 3''N'' coordinates to uniquely define the configuration of the system. These are all specific points in space to locate the particles, a general point in space is written '''r''' = (''x'', ''y'', ''z''). The [[velocity]] of each particle is how fast the particle moves along its path of motion, and is the [[time derivative]] of its position, thus '''v'''<sub>1</sub> = d'''r'''<sub>1</sub>/d''t'', '''v'''<sub>2</sub> = d'''r'''<sub>2</sub>/d''t'' and so on.\n\nIn Newtonian mechanics, the [[equations of motion]] are given by [[Newton's laws]]. The second law \"net [[force]] equals mass times [[acceleration]]\", \u03a3 '''F''' = ''m'' d<sup>2</sup>'''r'''/d''t''<sup>2</sup>, applies to each particle. For an ''N'' particle system in 3d, there are 3''N'' second order [[ordinary differential equation]]s in the positions of the particles to solve for.\n\nInstead of forces, Lagrangian mechanics uses the [[energy|energies]] in the system. The central quantity of Lagrangian mechanics is the '''Lagrangian''', a function which summarizes the dynamics of the entire system. Overall, the Lagrangian has units of [[energy]], but no single expression for all physical systems. Any function which generates the correct equations of motion, in agreement with physical laws, can be taken as a Lagrangian. It is nevertheless possible to construct general expressions for large classes of applications. The ''non-relativistic'' Lagrangian for a system of particles can be defined by<ref>Torby1984, p.270</ref>\n\n:<math>L = T - V  </math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>T = \\frac {1}{2} \\sum_{k=1}^N m_k v^2_k </math>\n\nis the total [[kinetic energy]] of the system, equaling the [[summation|sum]] \u03a3 of the kinetic energies of the particles,<ref name=\"Torby 1984 page=269\">{{harvnb|Torby|1984|page=269}}</ref> and ''V'' is the [[potential energy]] of the system.\n\nKinetic energy is the energy of the system's motion, and ''v<sub>k</sub>''<sup>2</sup> = '''v'''<sub>''k''</sub> \u00b7 '''v'''<sub>''k''</sub> is the magnitude squared of velocity, equivalent to the [[dot product]] of the velocity with itself. The kinetic energy is a function only of the velocities '''v'''<sub>''k''</sub>, not the positions '''r'''<sub>''k''</sub> nor time ''t'', so ''T'' = ''T''('''v'''<sub>1</sub>, '''v'''<sub>2</sub>, ...).\n\nThe [[potential energy]] of the system reflects the energy of interaction between the particles, i.e. how much energy any one particle will have due to all the others and other external influences. For [[conservative force]]s (e.g. [[Newtonian gravity]]), it is a function of the position vectors of the particles only, so ''V'' = ''V''('''r'''<sub>1</sub>, '''r'''<sub>2</sub>, ...). For those non-conservative forces which can be derived from an appropriate potential (e.g. [[electromagnetic potential]]), the velocities will appear also, ''V'' = ''V''('''r'''<sub>1</sub>, '''r'''<sub>2</sub>, ..., '''v'''<sub>1</sub>, '''v'''<sub>2</sub>, ...). If there is some external field or external driving force changing with time, the potential will change with time, so most generally ''V'' = ''V''('''r'''<sub>1</sub>, '''r'''<sub>2</sub>, ..., '''v'''<sub>1</sub>, '''v'''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''t'').\n\nThe above form of ''L'' does not hold in [[relativistic Lagrangian mechanics]], and must be replaced by a function consistent with special or general relativity. Also, for dissipative forces another function must be introduced alongside ''L''.\n\nOne or more of the particles may each be subject to one or more [[holonomic constraint]]s, such a constraint is described by an equation of the form ''f''('''r''', ''t'') = 0. If the number of constraints in the system is ''C'', then each constraint has an equation, ''f''<sub>1</sub>('''r''', ''t'') = 0, ''f''<sub>2</sub>('''r''', ''t'') = 0, ... ''f<sub>C</sub>''('''r''', ''t'') = 0, each could apply to any of the particles. If particle ''k'' is subject to constraint ''i'', then ''f<sub>i</sub>''('''r'''<sub>''k''</sub>, ''t'') = 0. At any instant of time, the coordinates of a constrained particle are linked together and not independent. The constraint equations determine the allowed paths the particles can move along, but not where they are or how fast they go at every instant of time. [[Nonholonomic constraints]] depend on the particle velocities, accelerations, or higher derivatives of position. Lagrangian mechanics can only be applied to systems with holonomic constraints. Three examples<ref>{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|2008|page=36\u201340}}</ref> are when the constraint equations are nonintegrable, when the constraints have inequalities, or with complicated non-conservative forces like friction. Nonholonomic constraints require special treatment, and one may revert to Newtonian mechanics, or use other methods.\n\nIf ''T'' or ''V'' or both depend explicitly on time due to time-varying constraints or external influences, the Lagrangian ''L''('''r'''<sub>1</sub>, '''r'''<sub>2</sub>, ... '''v'''<sub>1</sub>, '''v'''<sub>2</sub>, ... ''t'') is ''explicitly time-dependent''. If neither the potential nor the kinetic energy depend on time, then the Lagrangian ''L''('''r'''<sub>1</sub>, '''r'''<sub>2</sub>, ... '''v'''<sub>1</sub>, '''v'''<sub>2</sub>, ...) is ''explicitly independent of time''. In either case, the Lagrangian will always have implicit time-dependence through the generalized coordinates.\n\nWith these definitions '''Lagrange's equations of the first kind''' are<ref>{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|2008|page=60\u201361}}</ref>\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|title='''Lagrange's equations''' ''(First kind)''\n|equation = <math>\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_k} + \\sum_{i=1}^C \\lambda_i\\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k }=0 </math>\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border = 1\n|border colour = black\n|background colour=white}}\n\nwhere ''k'' = 1, 2, ..., ''N'' labels the particles, there is a [[Lagrange multiplier]] ''\u03bb<sub>i</sub>'' for each constraint equation ''f<sub>i</sub>'', and\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k} \\equiv \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k},\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_k},\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_k}\\right)\\,,\\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_k} \\equiv \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{x}_k},\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{y}_k},\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{z}_k}\\right)</math>\n\nare each shorthands for a vector of [[partial derivative]]s {{math|\u2202/\u2202}} with respect to the indicated variables (not a derivative with respect to the entire vector).<ref group=nb>Sometimes in this context the [[variational derivative]] denoted and defined as\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta \\mathbf{r}_k} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_k} \\,</math>\n\nis used. Throughout this article only partial and total derivatives are used.</ref> Each overdot is a shorthand for a [[time derivative]]. This procedure does increase the number of equations to solve compared to Newton's laws, from 3''N'' to 3''N'' + ''C'', because there are 3''N'' coupled second order differential equations in the position coordinates and multipliers, plus ''C'' constraint equations. However, when solved alongside the position coordinates of the particles, the multipliers can yield information about the constraint forces. The coordinates do not need to be eliminated by solving the constraint equations.\n\nIn the Lagrangian, the position coordinates and velocity components are all [[Dependent and independent variables#Mathematics|independent variable]]s, and derivatives of the Lagrangian are taken with respect to these separately according to the usual [[differentiation rules]] (e.g. the derivative of ''L'' with respect to the ''z''-velocity component of particle 2, ''v''<sub>''z''2</sub> = d''z''<sub>2</sub>/d''t'', is just that; no awkward [[chain rule]]s or [[total derivative]]s need to be used to relate the velocity component to the corresponding coordinate ''z''<sub>2</sub>).\n\nIn each constraint equation, one coordinate is redundant because it is determined from the other two. The number of ''independent'' coordinates is therefore ''n'' = 3''N'' \u2212 ''C''. We can transform each position vector to a common set of ''n'' [[generalized coordinates]], conveniently written as an ''n''-tuple '''q''' = (''q''<sub>1</sub>, ''q''<sub>2</sub>, ... ''q<sub>n</sub>''), by expressing each position vector, and hence the position coordinates, as [[function (mathematics)|function]]s of the generalized coordinates and time,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{r}_k = \\mathbf{r}_k(\\mathbf{q}, t) = (x_k(\\mathbf{q}, t), y_k(\\mathbf{q}, t), z_k(\\mathbf{q}, t), t)\\,.</math>\n\nThe vector '''q''' is a point in the [[configuration space]] of the system. The time derivatives of the generalized coordinates are called the generalized velocities, and for each particle the transformation of its velocity vector, the [[total derivative]] of its position with respect to time, is\n\n:<math>\\dot{q}_j = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}q_j}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\,, \\quad \\mathbf{v}_k = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k}{\\partial q_j}\\dot{q}_j +\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k}{\\partial t}\\,. </math>\n\nGiven this '''v'''<sub>''k''</sub>, the kinetic energy ''in generalized coordinates'' depends on the generalized velocities, generalized coordinates, and time if the position vectors depend explicitly on time due to time-varying constraints, so ''T'' = ''T''('''q''', d'''q'''/d''t'', ''t'').\n\nWith these definitions we have the '''[[Euler\u2013Lagrange equation]]s''', or '''Lagrange's equations of the second kind'''<ref>{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|2008|page=19}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Penrose|2007|page=}}</ref>\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|title='''Lagrange's equations''' ''(Second kind)''\n|equation = <math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\left ( \\frac {\\partial  L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_j} \\right ) =  \\frac {\\partial L}{\\partial q_j} </math>\n|cellpadding\n|border = 1\n|border colour = black\n|background colour = white}}\n\nare mathematical results from the [[calculus of variations]], which can also be used in mechanics. Substituting in the Lagrangian ''L''('''q''', d'''q'''/d''t'', ''t''), gives the [[equations of motion]] of the system. The number of equations has decreased compared to Newtonian mechanics, from 3''N'' to ''n'' = 3''N'' \u2212 ''C'' coupled second order differential equations in the generalized coordinates. These equations do not include constraint forces at all, only non-constraint forces need to be accounted for.\n\nAlthough the equations of motion include [[partial derivative]]s, the results of the partial derivatives are still [[ordinary differential equation]]s in the position coordinates of the particles. The [[total derivative|total time derivative]] denoted d/d''t'' often involves [[implicit differentiation]]. Both equations are linear in the Lagrangian, but will generally be nonlinear coupled equations in the coordinates.\n\n==From Newtonian to Lagrangian mechanics==\n\n===Newton's laws===\n[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb||150px|[[Isaac Newton]] (1642\u20141727)]]\n\nFor simplicity, Newton's laws can be illustrated for one particle without much loss of generality (for a system of ''N'' particles, all of these equations apply to each particle in the system). The [[equation of motion]] for particle of mass ''m'' is [[Newton's second law]] of 1687, in modern vector notation\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{F} = m \\mathbf{a} \\,, </math>\n\nwhere '''a''' is its acceleration and '''F''' the resultant force acting ''on'' it. In three spatial dimensions, this is a system of three coupled second order [[ordinary differential equation]]s to solve, since there are three components in this vector equation. The solutions are the position vectors '''r''' of the particles at time ''t'', subject to the [[initial condition]]s of '''r''' and '''v''' when ''t'' = 0.\n\nNewton's laws are easy to use in Cartesian coordinates, but Cartesian coordinates are not always convenient, and for other coordinate systems the equations of motion can become complicated. In a set of [[curvilinear coordinates]] '''\u03be''' = (''\u03be''<sup>1</sup>, ''\u03be''<sup>2</sup>, ''\u03be''<sup>3</sup>), the law in [[tensor index notation]] is the ''\"Lagrangian form\"''<ref name=\"Schuam 1988\">{{harvnb|Schuam|page=156|1988}}</ref><ref name=\"Synge 1949\">{{harvnb|Synge|Schild|page=150\u2013152|1949}}</ref>\n\n:<math> F^a = m \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 \\xi^a}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + \\Gamma^a {}_{bc} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\xi^b}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\xi^c}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\dot{\\xi}^a} - \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\xi^a} \\,, \\quad \\dot{\\xi}^a \\equiv \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\xi^a }{\\mathrm{d}t} \\,, </math>\n\nwhere ''F<sup>a</sup>'' is the ''a''th [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant component]]s of the resultant force acting on the particle, \u0393''<sup>a</sup><sub>bc</sub>'' are the [[Christoffel symbols]] of the second kind,\n\n:<math>T = \\frac{1}{2} m g_{bc} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\xi^b}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\xi^c}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\,, </math>\n\nis the kinetic energy of the particle, and ''g<sub>bc</sub>'' the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant components]] of the ''[[metric tensor]]'' of the curvilinear coordinate system. All the indices ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', each take the values 1, 2, 3. Curvilinear coordinates are not the same as generalized coordinates.\n\nIt may seem like an overcomplication to cast Newton's law in this form, but there are advantages. The acceleration components in terms of the Christoffel symbols can be avoided by evaluating derivatives of the kinetic energy instead. If there is no resultant force acting on the particle, '''F''' = '''0''', it does not accelerate, but moves with constant velocity in a straight line. Mathematically, the solutions of the differential equation are ''[[geodesic]]s'', the curves of extremal length between two points in space (These may end up being minimal so the shortest paths, but that is not necessary). In flat 3d real space the geodesics are simply straight lines. So for a free particle, Newton's second law coincides with the geodesic equation, and states free particles follow geodesics, the extremal trajectories it can move along. If the particle is subject to forces, '''F''' \u2260 '''0''', the particle accelerates due to forces acting on it, and deviates away from the geodesics it would follow if free. With appropriate extensions of the quantities given here in flat 3d space to 4d [[curved spacetime]], the above form of Newton's law also carries over to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]], in which case free particles follow geodesics in curved spacetime that are no longer \"straight lines\" in the ordinary sense.<ref>{{harvnb|Foster|Nightingale|1995|page=89}}</ref>\n\nHowever, we still need to know the total resultant force '''F''' acting on the particle, which in turn requires the resultant non-constraint force '''N''' plus the resultant constraint force '''C''',\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{C} + \\mathbf{N} \\,. </math>\n\nThe constraint forces can be complicated, since they will generally depend on time. Also, if there are constraints, the curvilinear coordinates are not independent but related by one or more constraint equations.\n\nThe constraint forces can either be eliminated from the equations of motion so only the non-constraint forces remain, or included by including the constraint equations in the equations of motion.\n\n===D'Alembert's principle===\n\n[[File:Alembert.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Jean d'Alembert]] (1717\u20141783)]]\n\n{{multiple image\n|align = vertical\n|width = 200\n|image1 = Constraint force virtual displacement 1 dof.svg\n|caption1 = One degree of freedom.\n|image2 = Constraint force virtual displacement 2 dof.svg \n|caption2 = Two degrees of freedom.\n|footer = Constraint force '''C''' and virtual displacement ''\u03b4'''''r''' for a particle of mass ''m'' confined to a curve.

However, it cannot be readily used to set up the equations of motion in an arbitrary coordinate system since the displacements \u03b4'''r'''<sub>''k''</sub> might be connected by a constraint equation, which prevents us from setting the ''N'' individual summands to 0. We will therefore seek a system of mutually independent coordinates for which the total sum will be 0 if and only if the individual summands are 0. Setting each of the summands to 0 will eventually give us our separated equations of motion.\n\n===Equations of motion from D'Alembert's principle===\nIf there are constraints on particle ''k'', then since the coordinates of the position '''r'''<sub>''k''</sub> = (''x<sub>k</sub>'', ''y<sub>k</sub>'', ''z<sub>k</sub>'') are linked together by a constraint equation, so are the those of the [[virtual displacement]]s ''\u03b4'''''r'''<sub>''k''</sub> = (''\u03b4x<sub>k</sub>'', ''\u03b4y<sub>k</sub>'', ''\u03b4z<sub>k</sub>''). Since the generalized coordinates are independent, we can avoid the complications with the ''\u03b4'''''r'''<sub>''k''</sub> by converting to virtual displacements in the generalized coordinates.

This may not always be possible for non-conservative forces, and Lagrange's equations do not involve any potential, only generalized forces; therefore they are more general than the Euler\u2013Lagrange equations.\n\nThe Euler\u2013Lagrange equations also follow from the [[calculus of variations]]. The ''variation'' of the Lagrangian is\n\n:<math>\\delta L = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q_j} \\delta q_j + \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_j} \\delta \\dot{q}_j \\right) \\,,\\quad \\delta \\dot{q}_j \\equiv \\delta\\frac{\\mathrm{d}q_j}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\equiv \\frac{\\mathrm{d}(\\delta q_j)}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\,, </math>\n\nwhich has a similar form to the [[total differential]] of ''L'', but the virtual displacements and their time derivatives replace differentials, and there is no time increment in accordance with the definition of the virtual displacements. An [[integration by parts]] with respect to time can transfer the time derivative of ''\u03b4q<sub>j</sub>'' to the \u2202''L''/\u2202(d''q<sub>j</sub>''/d''t''), in the process exchanging d(''\u03b4q<sub>j</sub>'')/d''t'' for ''\u03b4q<sub>j</sub>'', allowing the independent virtual displacements to be factorized from the derivatives of the Lagrangian,\n\n:<math>\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\delta L \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\sum_{j=1}^n\\left[\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_j}\\delta q_j\\right]_{t_1}^{t_2} + \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q_j} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_j} \\right)\\delta q_j \\, \\mathrm{d}t  \\,. </math>\n\nNow, if the condition ''\u03b4q<sub>j</sub>''(''t''<sub>1</sub>) = ''\u03b4q<sub>j</sub>''(''t''<sub>2</sub>) = 0 holds for all ''j'', the terms not integrated are zero. If in addition the entire time integral of ''\u03b4L'' is zero, then because the ''\u03b4q<sub>j</sub>'' are independent, and the only way for a definite integral to be zero is if the integrand equals zero, each of the coefficients of ''\u03b4q<sub>j</sub>'' must also be zero. Then we obtain the equations of motion. This can be summarized by '''[[Hamilton's principle]]''';\n\n:<math>\\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\\delta L \\, \\mathrm{d}t = 0 \\,. </math>\n\nThe time integral of the Lagrangian is another quantity called the [[action (physics)|action]], defined as<ref>{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|2008|page=51}}</ref>\n\n:<math>S = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L\\,\\mathrm{d}t\\,,</math>\n\nwhich is a ''[[Functional (mathematics)|functional]]''; it takes in the Lagrangian function for all times between ''t''<sub>1</sub> and ''t''<sub>2</sub> and returns a scalar value. Its dimensions are the same as [ [[angular momentum]] ], [energy]\u00b7[time], or [length]\u00b7[momentum]. With this definition Hamilton's principle is\n\n:<math>\\delta S = 0\\,. \\,\\!</math>\n\nThus, instead of thinking about particles accelerating in response to applied forces, one might think of them picking out the path with a stationary action, with the end points of the path in configuration space held fixed at the initial and final times. Hamilton's principle is sometimes referred to as the ''[[principle of least action]]'', however the action functional need only be ''stationary'', not necessarily a maximum or a minimum value. Any variation of the functional gives an increase in the functional integral of the action.\n\nHistorically, the idea of finding the shortest path a particle can follow subject to a force motivated the first applications of the [[calculus of variations]] to mechanical problems, such as the [[Brachistochrone problem]] solved by [[Jean Bernoulli]] in 1696, as well as [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Daniel Bernoulli]], [[Guillaume de l'H\u00f4pital|L'H\u00f4pital]] around the same time, and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] the following year.<ref name=\"Hand 2008 page=44\u201345\">{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|2008|page=44\u201345}}</ref> Newton himself was thinking along the lines of the variational calculus, but did not publish.<ref name=\"Hand 2008 page=44\u201345\"/> These ideas in turn lead to the [[variational principle]]s of mechanics, of [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]], [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertuis]], [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]], [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]], and others.\n\nHamilton's principle can be applied to [[nonholonomic constraints]] if the constraint equations can be put into a certain form, a [[linear combination]] of first order differentials in the coordinates. The resulting constraint equation can be rearranged into first order differential equation.<ref>{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980}}</ref> This will not be given here.\n\n===Lagrange multipliers and constraints===\n\nThe Lagrangian ''L'' can be varied in the Cartesian '''r'''<sub>''k''</sub> coordinates, for ''N'' particles,\n\n:<math>\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\sum_{k=1}^N \\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_k} \\right)\\cdot\\delta \\mathbf{r}_k \\, \\mathrm{d}t = 0 \\,. </math>\n\nHamilton's principle is still valid even if the coordinates ''L'' is expressed in are not independent, here '''r'''<sub>''k''</sub>, but the constraints are still assumed to be holonomic.<ref>{{harvnb|Fetter|Walecka|pp=68\u201370}}</ref> As always the end points are fixed ''\u03b4'''''r'''<sub>''k''</sub>(''t''<sub>1</sub>) = ''\u03b4'''''r'''<sub>''k''</sub>(''t''<sub>2</sub>) = '''0''' for all ''k''. What cannot be done is to simply equate the coefficients of \u03b4'''r'''<sub>''k''</sub> to zero because the \u03b4'''r'''<sub>''k''</sub> are not independent. Instead, the method of [[Lagrange multiplier]]s can be used to include the constraints. Multiplying each constraint equation ''f<sub>i</sub>''('''r'''<sub>''k''</sub>, ''t'') = 0 by a Lagrange multiplier ''\u03bb<sub>i</sub>'' for ''i'' = 1, 2, ..., ''C'', and adding the results to the original Lagrangian, gives the new Lagrangian\n\n:<math>L' = L(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2,\\ldots,\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_1,\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_2,\\ldots,t) + \\sum_{i=1}^C \\lambda_i(t) f_i(\\mathbf{r}_k,t) \\,. </math>\n\nThe Lagrange multipliers are arbitrary functions of time ''t'', but not functions of the coordinates '''r'''<sub>''k''</sub>, so the multipliers are on equal footing with the position coordinates. Varying this new Lagrangian and integrating with respect to time gives\n\n:<math>\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\delta L' \\mathrm{d}t = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\sum_{k=1}^N \\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_k} + \\sum_{i=1}^C \\lambda_i \\frac{\\partial f_i }{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k}\\right)\\cdot\\delta \\mathbf{r}_k \\, \\mathrm{d}t = 0 \\,. </math>\n\nThe introduced multipliers can be found so that the coefficients of ''\u03b4'''''r'''<sub>''k''</sub> are zero, even though the '''r'''<sub>''k''</sub> are not independent. The equations of motion follow. From the preceding analysis, obtaining the solution to this integral is equivalent to the statement\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial L'}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\frac{\\partial L'}{\\partial \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_k} = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_k} + \\sum_{i=1}^C \\lambda_i \\frac{\\partial f_i }{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k} = 0 \\,, </math>\n\nwhich are '''Lagrange's equations of the first kind'''. Also, the ''\u03bb<sub>i</sub>'' Euler-Lagrange equations for the new Lagrangian return the constraint equations\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial L'}{\\partial \\lambda_i} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\frac{\\partial L'}{\\partial \\dot{\\lambda}_i}  = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad f_i(\\mathbf{r}_k,t) = 0 \\,. </math>\n\nFor the case of a conservative force given by the gradient of some potential energy ''V'', a function of the '''r'''<sub>k</sub> coordinates only, substituting the Lagrangian ''L'' = ''T'' \u2212 ''V'' gives\n\n:<math>\\underbrace{ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}_k} }_{-\\mathbf{F}_k} + \\underbrace{ - \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k}}_{\\mathbf{N}_k} + \\sum_{i=1}^C \\lambda_i \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k} = 0 \\,, </math>\n\nand identifying the derivatives of kinetic energy as the (negative of the) resultant force, and the derivatives of the potential equaling the non-constraint force, it follows the constraint forces are\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{C}_k = \\sum_{i=1}^C \\lambda_i \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}_k}  \\,, </math>\n\nthus giving the constraint forces explicitly in terms of the constraint equations and the Lagrange multipliers.\n\n==Properties of the Euler\u2013Lagrange equation==\n\nIn some cases, the Lagrangian has properties which can provide information about the system without solving the equations of motion. These follow from Lagrange's equations of the second kind.\n\n===Non uniqueness===\n\nThe Lagrangian of a given system is not unique. A Lagrangian ''L'' can be multiplied by a nonzero constant ''a'', an arbitrary constant ''b'' can be added, and the new Lagrangian ''aL'' + ''b'' will describe exactly the same motion as ''L''. A less obvious result is that two Lagrangians describing the same system can differ by the [[total derivative]] (not [[partial derivative|partial]]) of some function ''f''('''q''', ''t'') with respect to time;<ref name=\"Landau 1976 page=4\">{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|edition=3rd|1976|page=4}}</ref>\n\n:<math>L' = L + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f(\\mathbf{q},t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\,.</math>\n\nEach Lagrangian will obtain exactly the same equations of motion.<ref>{{harvnb|Goldstien|Poole|Safko|2002|edition=3rd|page=21}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1976|page=4}}</ref>\n\n===Invariance under point transformations===\n\nGiven a set of generalized coordinates '''q''', if we change these variables to a new set of generalized coordinates '''s''' according to a [[Canonical transformation|point transformation]] '''q''' = '''q'''('''s''', ''t''), the new Lagrangian ''L''&prime; is a function of the new coordinates\n\n:<math>L(\\mathbf{q}(\\mathbf{s},t), \\dot{\\mathbf{q}}(\\mathbf{s},\\dot{\\mathbf{s}},t), t ) = L'(\\mathbf{s}, \\dot{\\mathbf{s}},t) \\,,</math>\n\nand by the [[chain rule#Higher dimensions|chain rule]] for partial differentiation, Lagrange's equations are invariant under this transformation;<ref>{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|page=21}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\frac{\\partial L'}{\\partial \\dot{s}_i} = \\frac{\\partial L'}{\\partial s_i} \\,.</math>\n\nThis may simplify the equations of motion.\n\n===Cyclic coordinates and conserved momenta===\n\nAn important property of the Lagrangian is that [[Conservation law|conserved quantities]] can easily be read off from it. The ''generalized momentum'' \"canonically conjugate to\" the coordinate ''q<sub>i</sub>'' is defined by\n\n:<math>p_i =\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial\\dot q_i}.</math>\n\nIf the Lagrangian ''L'' does ''not'' depend on some coordinate ''q<sub>i</sub>'', it follows immediately from the Euler\u2013Lagrange equations that\n\n:<math>\\dot{p}_i = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial\\dot q_i} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q_i}=0\\,.</math>\n\nand integrating shows the corresponding generalized momentum equals a constant, a conserved quantity. This is a special case of [[Noether's theorem]]. Such coordinates are called \"cyclic\" or \"ignorable\".\n\nFor example, a system may have a Lagrangian\n\n:<math>L(r,\\theta,\\dot{s},\\dot{z},\\dot{r},\\dot{\\theta},\\dot{\\phi},t)\\,,</math>\n\nwhere ''r'' and ''z'' are lengths along straight lines, ''s'' is an arc length along some curve, and ''\u03b8'' and ''\u03c6'' are angles. Notice ''z'', ''s'', and ''\u03c6'' are all absent in the Lagrangian even though their velocities are not. Then the momenta\n\n:<math>p_z =\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial\\dot z}\\,,\\quad p_s =\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot s}\\,,\\quad p_\\phi =\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot \\phi}\\,,</math>\n\nare all conserved quantities. The units and nature of each generalized momentum will depend on the corresponding coordinate; in this case ''p<sub>z</sub>'' is a translational momentum in the ''z'' direction, ''p<sub>s</sub>'' is also a translational momentum along the curve ''s'' is measured, and ''p<sub>\u03c6</sub>'' is an angular momentum in the plane the angle ''\u03c6'' is measured in. However complicated the motion of the system is, all the coordinates and velocities will vary in such a way that these momenta are conserved.\n\n===Energy conservation===\n\nTaking the [[total derivative]] of the Lagrangian ''L'' = ''T'' \u2212 ''V'' with respect to time leads to the general result\n\n:<math> - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\dot{q}_i\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i} - L\\right)\\,.</math>\n \nIf the entire Lagrangian is explicitly independent of time, it follows the partial time derivative of the Lagrangian is zero, {{math|\u2202''L''/\u2202''t'' {{=}} 0}}, so the quantity under the total time derivative in brackets\n\n:<math>E = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\dot{q}_i\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i} - L </math>\n\nmust be a constant for all times during the motion of the system, and it also follows the kinetic energy is a [[homogenous function]] of degree 2 in the generalized velocities. If in addition the potential ''V'' is only a function of coordinates and independent of velocities, it follows by direct calculation, or use of [[Homogeneous function#Positive homogeneity|Euler's theorem for homogenous functions]], that\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^n \\dot{q}_i\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\dot{q}_i\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i}  = 2T \\,.</math>\n\nUnder all these circumstances,<ref>{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1976|page=14}}</ref> the constant\n\n:<math>E = T + V </math>\n\nis the ''total [[Conservation of energy|conserved energy]]'' of the system. The kinetic and potential energies still change as the system evolves, but the motion of the system will be such that their sum, the total energy, is constant. This is a valuable simplification, since the energy ''E'' is a constant of integration that counts as an arbitrary constant for the problem, and it may be possible to integrate the velocities from this energy relation to solve for the coordinates. In the case the velocity or kinetic energy or both depends on time, then the energy is ''not'' conserved.\n\n===Mechanical similarity===\n\n{{Main|Mechanical similarity}}\n\nIf the potential energy is a [[homogeneous function]] of the coordinates and independent of time,<ref>{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1976|page=22}}</ref> and all position vectors are scaled by the same nonzero constant ''\u03b1'', '''r'''<sub>''k''</sub>&prime; = ''\u03b1'''''r'''<sub>''k''</sub>, so that\n\n:<math>V(\\alpha\\mathbf{r}_1,\\alpha\\mathbf{r}_2,\\ldots, \\alpha\\mathbf{r}_N)=\\alpha^N V(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2,\\ldots, \\mathbf{r}_N)</math>\n\nand time is scaled by a factor ''\u03b2'', ''t''&prime; = ''\u03b2t'', then the velocities '''v'''<sub>''k''</sub> are scaled by a factor of ''\u03b1''/''\u03b2'' and the kinetic energy ''T'' by (''\u03b1''/''\u03b2'')<sup>2</sup>. The entire Lagrangian has been scaled by the same factor if\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\beta^2}=\\alpha^N \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\beta = \\alpha^{1-N/2}\\,.</math>\n\nSince the lengths and times have been scaled, the trajectories of the particles in the system follow geometrically similar paths differing in size. The length ''l'' traversed in time ''t'' in the original trajectory corresponds to a new length ''l&prime;'' traversed in time ''t&prime;'' in the new trajectory, given by the ratios\n\n:<math>\\frac{t'}{t}= \\left(\\frac{l'}{l}\\right)^{1-N/2}\\,.</math>\n\n===Interacting particles===\n\nFor a given system, if two subsystems ''A'' and ''B'' are non-interacting, the Lagrangian ''L'' of the overall system is the sum of the Lagrangians ''L<sub>A</sub>'' and ''L<sub>B</sub>'' for the subsystems:<ref name=\"Landau 1976 page=4\"/>\n\n:<math>L = L_A + L_B \\,. </math>\n\nIf they do interact this is not possible. In some situations, it may be possible to separate the Lagrangian of the system ''L'' into the sum of non-interacting Lagrangians, plus another Lagrangian ''L<sub>AB</sub>'' containing information about the interaction,\n\n:<math>L = L_A + L_B + L_{AB}\\,.</math>\n\nThis may be physically motivated by taking the non-interacting Lagrangians to be kinetic energies only, while the interaction Lagrangian is the system's total potential energy. Also, in the limiting case of negligible interaction, ''L<sub>AB</sub>'' tends to zero reducing to the non-interacting case above.\n\nThe extension to more than two non-interacting subsystems is straightforwards - the overall Lagrangian is the sum of the separate Lagrangians for each subsystem. If there are interactions, then interaction Lagrangians may be added.\n\n==Examples==\n\nThe following examples apply Lagrange's equations of the second kind to mechanical problems.\n\n===Conservative force===\n\nA particle of mass ''m'' moves under the influence of a [[conservative force]] derived from the [[gradient]] \u2207 of a [[scalar potential]],\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = -\\nabla V(\\mathbf{r})\\,.</math>\n\nIf there are more particles, in accordance with the above results, the total kinetic energy is a sum over all the particle kinetic energies, and the potential is a function of all the coordinates.\n\n====Cartesian coordinates====\n\nThe Lagrangian of the particle can be written\n\n:<math>L(x,y,z, \\dot{x}, \\dot{y},\\dot{z}) = \\frac{1}{2} m (\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + \\dot{z}^2) - V(x,y,z)\\,.</math>\n\nThe equations of motion for the particle are found by applying the [[Euler\u2013Lagrange equation]], for the ''x'' coordinate\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\left( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} \\,, </math>\n\nwith derivatives\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = - \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\\,,\\quad \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}}  = m \\dot{x}\\,,\\quad \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\left( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}} \\right) = m \\ddot{x}\\,,</math>\n\nhence\n\n:<math>m \\ddot{x} = - \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\\,,</math>\n\nand similarly for the ''y'' and ''z'' coordinates.

By considering limit cases, the correctness of this system can be verified: For example, <math>\\ddot x \\to 0</math> should give the equations of motion for a [[simple pendulum]] that is at rest in some [[inertial frame]], while <math>\\ddot\\theta \\to 0</math> should give the equations for a pendulum in a constantly accelerating system, etc. Furthermore, it is trivial to obtain the results numerically, given suitable starting conditions and a chosen time step, by [[Numerical ordinary differential equations|stepping through the results iteratively]].\n\n===Two-body central force problem===\n{{main|Two-body problem|Central force}}\n\nTwo bodies of masses ''m''<sub>1</sub> and ''m''<sub>2</sub> with position vectors '''r'''<sub>1</sub> and '''r'''<sub>2</sub> are in orbit about each other due to an attractive [[central potential]] ''V''. We may write down the Lagrangian in terms of the position coordinates as they are, but it is an established procedure to convert the two-body problem into a one-body problem as follows. Introduce the [[Jacobi coordinates]]; the separation of the bodies '''r''' = '''r'''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 '''r'''<sub>1</sub> and the location of the [[center of mass]] '''R''' = (''m''<sub>1</sub>'''r'''<sub>1</sub> + ''m''<sub>2</sub>'''r'''<sub>2</sub>)/(''m''<sub>1</sub> + ''m''<sub>2</sub>). The Lagrangian is then<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|2005|page=297}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Padmanabhan|2000|edition=3rd|page=48 }}</ref><ref group = nb>The Lagrangian also can be written explicitly for a rotating frame.

The Lagrangian splits into a ''center-of-mass'' term ''L''<sub>cm</sub> and a ''relative motion'' term ''L''<sub>rel</sub>.\n\nThe Euler\u2013Lagrange equation for '''R''' is simply\n\n:<math>M\\ddot{\\mathbf{R}} = 0 \\,, </math>\n\nwhich states the center of mass moves in a straight line at constant velocity.\n\nSince the relative motion only depends on the magnitude of the separation, it is ideal to use polar coordinates (''r'', ''\u03b8'') and take ''r'' = |'''r'''|,\n\n:<math>L_\\text{rel}=\\frac{1}{2} \\mu (\\dot{r}^2 +r^2 \\dot{\\theta}^2 ) - V(r) \\,, </math>\n\nso ''\u03b8'' is an ignorable coordinate with the corresponding conserved (angular) momentum\n\n:<math>p_\\theta = \\frac {\\partial L_\\text{rel}}{\\partial \\dot \\theta} = \\mu r^2 \\dot \\theta = \\ell \\,. </math>\n\nThe radial coordinate ''r'' and angular velocity d''\u03b8''/d''t'' can vary with time, but only in such a way that ''\u2113'' is constant. The Lagrange equation for ''r'' is\n\n:<math>\\mu r \\dot \\theta ^2 -\\frac {dV}{dr} = \\mu \\ddot{r} \\,. </math>\n\nThis equation is identical to the radial equation obtained using Newton's laws in a ''co-rotating'' reference frame, that is, a frame rotating with the reduced mass so it appears stationary. Eliminating the angular velocity d''\u03b8''/d''t'' from this radial equation,<ref>{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|1998|pages=140\u2013141 }}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\mu \\ddot r = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}r} + \\frac{\\ell^2}{\\mu r^3} \\,. </math>\n\nwhich is the equation of motion for a one-dimensional problem in which a particle of mass ''\u03bc'' is subjected to the inward central force \u2212 d''V''/d''r'' and a second outward force, called in this context the [[centrifugal force]]\n\n:<math>F_{\\mathrm{cf}} = \\mu r \\dot \\theta ^2 = \\frac {\\ell^2}{\\mu r^3} \\,. </math>\n\nOf course, if one remains entirely within the one-dimensional formulation, ''\u2113'' enters only as some imposed parameter of the external outward force, and its interpretation as angular momentum depends upon the more general two-dimensional problem from which the one-dimensional problem originated.\n\nIf one arrives at this equation using Newtonian mechanics in a co-rotating frame, the interpretation is evident as the centrifugal force in that frame due to the rotation of the frame itself. If one arrives at this equation directly by using the generalized coordinates (''r'', ''\u03b8'') and simply following the Lagrangian formulation without thinking about frames at all, the interpretation is that the centrifugal force is an outgrowth of ''using polar coordinates''. As Hildebrand says:<ref>{{harvnb|Hildebrand|1992 |page=156}}</ref>\n\n\"Since such quantities are not true physical forces, they are often called ''inertia forces''. Their presence or absence depends, not upon the particular problem at hand, but ''upon the coordinate system chosen''.\" In particular, if Cartesian coordinates are chosen, the centrifugal force disappears, and the formulation involves only the central force itself, which provides the [[centripetal force]] for a curved motion.\n\nThis viewpoint, that fictitious forces originate in the choice of coordinates, often is expressed by users of the Lagrangian method. This view arises naturally in the Lagrangian approach, because the frame of reference is (possibly unconsciously) selected by the choice of coordinates. For example, see<ref>{{harvnb|Zak|Zbilut|Meyers|1997|pages=202}}</ref> for a comparison of Lagrangians in an inertial and in a noninertial frame of reference. See also the discussion of \"total\" and \"updated\" Lagrangian formulations in.<ref>{{harvnb|Shabana|2008|pages=118\u2013119}}</ref> Unfortunately, this usage of \"inertial force\" conflicts with the Newtonian idea of an inertial force. In the Newtonian view, an inertial force originates in the acceleration of the frame of observation (the fact that it is not an [[inertial frame of reference]]), not in the choice of coordinate system. To keep matters clear, it is safest to refer to the Lagrangian inertial forces as ''generalized'' inertial forces, to distinguish them from the Newtonian vector inertial forces. That is, one should avoid following Hildebrand when he says (p.&nbsp;155) \"we deal ''always'' with ''generalized'' forces, velocities accelerations, and momenta. For brevity, the adjective \"generalized\" will be omitted frequently.\"\n\nIt is known that the Lagrangian of a system is not unique. Within the Lagrangian formalism the Newtonian fictitious forces can be identified by the existence of alternative Lagrangians in which the fictitious forces disappear, sometimes found by exploiting the symmetry of the system.<ref>{{harvnb|Gannon|2006 |page=267}}</ref>\n\n===Electromagnetism===\n\nA test particle is a particle whose [[mass]] and [[electric charge|charge]] are assumed to be so small that its effect on external system is insignificant. It is often a hypothetical simplified point particle with no properties other than mass and charge. Real particles like [[electron]]s and [[up quark]]s are more complex and have additional terms in their Lagrangians.\n\nThe Lagrangian for a [[charged particle]] with [[electrical charge]] ''q'', interacting with an [[electromagnetic field]], is the prototypical example of a velocity-dependent potential. The electric [[scalar potential]] ''\u03d5'' = ''\u03d5''('''r''', ''t'') and magnetic [[vector potential]] '''A''' = '''A'''('''r''', ''t'') are defined from the [[electric field]] '''E''' = '''E'''('''r''', ''t'') and [[magnetic field]] '''B''' = '''B'''('''r''', ''t'') as follows;\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{E} = - \\nabla\\phi - \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial t} \\,, \\quad \\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A} \\,. </math>\n\nThe Lagrangian of a massive charged test particle in an electromagnetic field is\n\n:<math> L = \\frac{m}{2} \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}^2 - q \\phi  + q \\dot{\\mathbf{r}} \\cdot \\mathbf{A} \\,,</math>\n\nwhich produces the [[Lorentz force]] law\n\n:<math>m \\ddot{\\mathbf{r}} = q \\mathbf{E} + q \\dot{\\mathbf{r}} \\times \\mathbf{B}  \\,. </math>\n\nAn interesting detail in this example is the generalized momentum conjugate to '''r''' is the ordinary momentum plus a contribution from the '''A''' field,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{p} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\mathbf{r}}} = m \\dot{\\mathbf{r}} + q \\mathbf{A} \\,. </math>\n\nIf '''r''' is cyclic, which happens if the ''\u03d5'' and '''A''' fields are uniform (independent of position), then this expression for '''p''' given here is the conserved momentum, while the usual quantity ''m'''''v''' is not. This relation is also used in the [[minimal coupling]] prescription in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]].\n\n==Extensions to include non-conservative forces==\n\n[[Dissipation]] (i.e. non-conservative systems) can also be treated with an effective Lagrangian formulated by a certain doubling of the degrees of freedom; see.<ref>{{harvnb|Kosyakov|2007}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Galley|2013}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hadar|Shahar|Kol|2014}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Birnholtz|Hadar|Kol|2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a more general formulation, the forces could be both conservative and [[viscosity|viscous]]. If an appropriate transformation can be found from the '''F'''<sub>i</sub>, [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Rayleigh]] suggests using a dissipation function, ''D'', of the following form:<ref name=\"Torby 1984 page=271\">{{harvnb|Torby|1984|page=271}}</ref>\n\n:<math>D = \\frac {1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^m \\sum_{k=1}^m C_{j k} \\dot{q}_j \\dot{q}_k \\,.</math>\n\nwhere ''C<sub>jk</sub>'' are constants that are related to the damping coefficients in the physical system, though not necessarily equal to them. If ''D'' is defined this way, then<ref name=\"Torby 1984 page=271\"/>\n\n:<math>Q_j = - \\frac {\\partial V}{\\partial q_j} - \\frac {\\partial D}{\\partial \\dot{q}_j}\\,</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\left ( \\frac {\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_j} \\right ) - \\frac {\\partial L}{\\partial q_j} + \\frac {\\partial D}{\\partial \\dot{q}_j} = 0\\,.</math>\n\n==Other contexts and formulations==\n\nThe ideas in Lagrangian mechanics have numerous applications in other areas of physics, and can adopt generalized results from the calculus of variations.\n\n===Alternative formulations of classical mechanics===\n\nA closely related formulation of classical mechanics is [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]. The Hamiltonian is defined by\n\n:<math> H = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\dot{q}_i\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i} - L \\,. </math>\n\nand can be obtained by performing a [[Legendre transformation]] on the Lagrangian, which introduces new variables [[Canonical coordinates|canonically conjugate]] to the original variables. For example, given a set of generalized coordinates, the variables [[canonical coordinates|canonically conjugate]] are the generalized momenta. This doubles the number of variables, but makes differential equations first order. The Hamiltonian is a particularly ubiquitous quantity in [[quantum mechanics]] (see [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)]]).\n\n[[Routhian mechanics]] is a hybrid formulation of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, which is not often used in practice but an efficient formulation for cyclic coordinates.\n\n===Momentum space formulation===\n{{main|Position and momentum space#Lagrangian mechanics}}\n\nThe Euler\u2013Lagrange equations can also be formulated in terms of the generalized momenta rather than generalized coordinates. Performing a Legendre transformation on the generalized coordinate Lagrangian ''L''('''q''', d'''q'''/d''t'', ''t'') obtains the generalized momenta Lagrangian ''L''&prime;('''p''', d'''p'''/d''t'', ''t'') in terms of the original Lagrangian, as well the EL equations in terms of the generalized momenta. Both Lagrangians contain the same information, and either can be used to solve for the motion of the system. In practice generalized coordinates are more convenient to use and interpret than generalized momenta.\n\n===Higher derivatives of generalized coordinates===\n\nThere is no reason to restrict the derivatives of generalized coordinates to first order only. It is possible to derive modified EL equations for a Lagrangian containing higher order derivatives, see [[Euler-Lagrange equation]] for details.\n\n===Optics===\n\n{{main|Hamiltonian optics}}\n\nLagrangian mechanics can be applied to [[geometrical optics]], by applying variational principles to rays of light in a medium, and solving the EL equations gives the equations of the paths the light rays follow.\n\n===Relativistic formulation===\n{{main|Relativistic Lagrangian mechanics}}\n\nLagrangian mechanics can be formulated in [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. Some features of Lagrangian mechanics are retained in the relativistic theories but difficulties quickly appear in other respects. In particular, the EL equations take the same form, and the connection between cyclic coordinates and conserved momenta still applies, however the Lagrangian must be modified and is not simply the kinetic minus the potential energy of a particle. Also, it is not straightforwards to handle multiparticle systems in a [[manifestly covariant]] way, it may be possible if a particular frame of reference is singled out.\n\n===Quantum mechanics===\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], [[action (physics)|action]] and quantum-mechanical [[phase (waves)|phase]] are related via [[Planck's constant]], and the [[principle of stationary action]] can be understood in terms of [[constructive interference]] of [[wave function]]s.\n\nIn 1948, [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]] discovered the [[path integral formulation]] extending the [[principle of least action]] to [[quantum mechanics]] for [[electrons]] and [[photons]]. In this formulation, particles travel every possible path between the initial and final states; the probability of a specific final state is obtained by summing over all possible trajectories leading to it. In the classical regime, the path integral formulation cleanly reproduces Hamilton's principle, and [[Fermat's principle]] in [[optics]].\n\n===Classical field theory===\n\nIn Lagrangian mechanics, the generalized coordinates form a discrete set of variables that define the configuration of a system. In [[classical field theory]], the physical system is not a set of discrete particles, but rather a continuous field ''\u03d5''('''r''', ''t'') defined over a region of 3d space. Associated with the field is a [[Lagrangian density]]\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}(\\phi, \\nabla \\phi, \\partial\\phi/\\partial t , \\mathbf{r},t)</math>\n\ndefined in terms of the field and its space and time derivatives at a location '''r''' and time ''t''. Analogous to the particle case, for non-relativistic applications the Lagrangian density is also the kinetic energy density of the field, minus its potential energy density (this is not true in general, and the Lagrangian density has to be \"reverse engineered\"). The Lagrangian is then the [[volume integral]] of the Lagrangian density over 3d space\n\n:<math> L(t) = \\int  \\mathcal{L} \\, \\mathrm{d}^3 \\mathbf{r} \\,</math>\n\nwhere d<sup>3</sup>'''r''' is a 3d [[Total differential#Differentials in several variables|differential]] [[volume element]]. The Lagrangian is a function of time since the Lagrangian density has implicit space dependence via the fields, and may have explicit spatial dependence, but these are removed in the integral, leaving only time in as the variable for the Lagrangian.\n\n===Noether's theorem===\n\nThe action principle, and the Lagrangian formalism, are tied closely to [[Noether's theorem]], which connects physical [[conserved quantity|conserved quantities]] to continuous [[symmetry (physics)|symmetries]] of a physical system.\n\nIf the Lagrangian is invariant under a symmetry, then the resulting equations of motion are also invariant under that symmetry. This characteristic is very helpful in showing that theories are consistent with either [[special relativity]] or [[general relativity]].\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations]] \n* [[Canonical coordinates]]\n* [[Functional derivative]]\n* [[Generalized coordinates]]\n* [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]\n* [[Hamiltonian optics]]\n* [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field]]\n* [[Lagrangian point]]\n* [[Lagrangian system]]\n* [[Non-autonomous mechanics]]\n* [[Restricted three-body problem]]\n* [[Plateau's problem]]\n* [[Inverse problem for Lagrangian mechanics]], the general topic of finding a Lagrangian for a system given the equations of motion.\n\n==Footnotes==\n\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{refbegin|3}}\n\n*{{cite book|title=M\u00e9canique analytique|year=1811|volume=1|first=J.
