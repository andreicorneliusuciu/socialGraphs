''Digital Communications'', 4th edition. McGraw-Hill, 2001. p150</ref>\n\n== Modulation ==\nA signal at baseband is often used to [[modulation|modulate]] a higher frequency [[carrier signal]] in order that it may be transmitted via radio. Modulation results in shifting the signal up to much higher frequencies (radio frequencies, or RF) than it originally spanned. A key consequence of the usual [[double sideband|double-sideband]] [[amplitude modulation]] (AM) is that the range of frequencies the signal spans (its spectral [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]) is doubled. Thus, the RF bandwidth of a signal (measured from the lowest frequency as opposed to 0&nbsp;Hz) is twice its baseband bandwidth. Steps may be taken to reduce this effect, such as [[single-sideband modulation]]. Some transmission schemes such as [[frequency modulation]] use even more bandwidth.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe figure shows what happens with AM modulation:\n\n[[File:Baseband to RF.svg|frame|center|Comparison of the equivalent baseband version of a signal and its AM-modulated (double-[[sideband]]) RF version, showing the typical doubling of the occupied bandwidth.]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Complex envelope]]\n* [[Broadband]]\n* [[Narrowband]]\n* [[Wideband]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Signal processing]]"}]}}}}
