If the mean amplitude is zero, there is no DC offset. \nA waveform without a DC component is known as a ''DC-balanced'' or ''DC-free'' waveform.<ref>{{Cite journal |journal=IEEE Transactions on Communications |volume=45 |issue=3 |date=March 1997 |title=Performance Assessment of DC-Free Multimode Codes |author=Kees Schouhamer Immink |authorlink=Kees Schouhamer Immink |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kees_Schouhamer_Immink/publication/3159156_Performance_assessment_of_dc-free_multimode_codes/links/54392c0f0cf24a6ddb95d411.pdf |pages=293\u2013299 |doi=10.1109/26.558690 |quote=The ''dc-balanced'' or ''dc-free'' codes, as they are often called, have a long history and their application is certainly not confined to recording practice.}}</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nThe term originated in electronics, where it refers to a [[direct current]] voltage.\nIn contrast, various other non-DC frequencies are analogous to superimposed [[alternating current]] (AC) voltages or currents, hence called ''AC components'' or ''AC coefficients''.\n\nThe concept has been extended to any representation of a [[waveform]] and to two-dimensional transformations like the [[discrete cosine transform]] used in [[JPEG]].\n\n==Practical applications==\nDC offset is usually undesirable when it causes [[Clipping (signal processing)|clipping]] or other undesirable change in the operating point of an amplifier. An electrical DC bias will not pass through a [[transformer]]; thus a simple [[isolation transformer]] can be used to block or remove it, leaving only the AC component on the other side. In signal processing terms, DC offset can be reduced in real-time by a [[high-pass filter]]. For stored digital signals, subtracting the mean amplitude from each sample will remove the offset.  Very low frequencies can look like DC bias but are called \"slowly changing DC\" or \"baseline wander\".\n\n===Communications systems===\nDC-balanced signals are used in communications systems to prevent bit errors when passing through circuits with [[capacitive coupling]] or [[transformer]]s. Bit errors can occur when a series of 1's create a DC level that charges the capacitor of the high-pass filter used as the AC coupler, bringing the signal input down incorrectly to a 0-level. In order to avoid these kinds of bit errors, most [[line code]]s are designed to produce DC-balanced waveforms. The most common classes of DC balanced line codes are [[constant-weight code]]s and [[paired-disparity code]]s.\n\n===Audio===\nIn audio recording, a DC offset is an undesirable characteristic of a recording sound. It occurs in the capturing of sound, before it reaches the recorder, and is normally caused by defective or low-quality equipment. The offset causes the center of the recording waveform to not be at 0, but at a higher or lower value, for example, +1 or -1. This can cause two main problems. Either the loudest parts of the signal will be clipped prematurely, since the base of the waveform has been moved up, or inaudible low-frequency distortion will occur. Low-frequency distortion may not be audible in the initial recording, but if the waveform is resampled to a compressed or lossy digital format, such as an MP3, those corruptions may become audible.<ref>http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/DC_offset</ref>\n\nA DC [[tape bias]] was used in early tape recorders to reduce distortion.\n\nA DC bias is applied to the control grid of [[vacuum tube]]s in [[power amplifier]]s in order to regulate power.<ref>{{cite web|author=Randall Aiken |url=http://www.aikenamps.com/WhatIsBiasing.htm |title=What Is Biasing? |publisher=Aikenamps.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}{{dl|date=August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Remote power===\nA DC bias [[phantom power]] can be used to power microphones or other devices over the same wires as required for the signal. This is commonly used, for example, in professional audio [[microphone]]s.\n\nOn modern [[satellite dish]]es, used for [[direct broadcast satellite|direct-broadcast]] [[satellite TV]], a DC bias is used to provide [[electrical power]] to the [[feedhorn]].  Changing the bias between approximately 12 and 18 volts also allows selection of the correct [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] (horizontal and vertical on older systems, [[clockwise]] and counterclockwise on newer [[circular polarization]] systems).\n\n===Frequency selection===\nOn a [[voltage-controlled oscillator]] (VCO), such as in a [[radio transmitter]], selection of the [[center frequency]] of the [[carrier wave]] is done with a DC bias.  For [[frequency modulation]] (FM), the AC component is the [[baseband]] [[audio signal]] plus any [[subcarrier]]s.  [[Frequency-shift keying]] can be done solely by changing the DC bias.\n\n===Electrical grid===\nThe [[electrical grid]], which is normally [[three-phase]] AC, can be severely disrupted by the presence of a large DC bias.  This is caused by strong [[solar flare]]s hitting the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]], which in turn creates strong [[electromagnetic field]]s.  This [[electromagnetic induction|induce]]s voltages in long-distance electrical lines, which can be strong enough to [[electrical arcing|arc]] across transformers.  (Even [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]s, such as the mostly above-ground [[Alaska Pipeline]], are prone to this, and must be tied to [[electrical ground]] with [[zinc]] [[sacrificial anode]]s.)  This is a rare but serious problem, mostly for far northern locations like [[Canada]] and [[Scandinavia]], where a strong [[aurora borealis]] will cover much lower [[latitude]]s than normal during such a situation.  [[Space weather]] [[weather forecast|forecast]]s are used to predict when these [[geomagnetic storm]] events might occur.  [[High-voltage direct current]] systems have their own control gear at [[electrical inverter|conversion]] stations and can adapt somewhat better to such conditions. However, large and often widely fluctuating voltages can still cause problems like [[harmonics]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Root-mean-square amplitude]]\n* [[Root-mean-square voltage]]\n\n{{Portal|Electronics|Energy}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Electrical parameters]]"}]}}}}
