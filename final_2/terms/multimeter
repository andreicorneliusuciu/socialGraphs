A typical multimeter can measure [[voltage]], [[Electric current|current]], and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]]. '''Analog multimeters''' use a [[microammeter]] with a moving pointer to display readings. '''Digital multimeters''' (DMM, DVOM) have a numeric display, and may also show a graphical bar representing the measured value. Digital multimeters are now far more common due to their cost and precision, but analog multimeters are still preferable in some cases, for example when monitoring a rapidly varying value.\n\nA multimeter can be a hand-held device useful for basic [[fault (electric)|fault]] finding and field service work, or a [[bench instrument]] which can measure to a very high degree of accuracy. They can be used to troubleshoot electrical problems in a wide array of industrial and household devices such as [[electronic equipment]], motor controls, [[domestic appliance]]s, [[power supply|power supplies]], and wiring systems.\n\nMultimeters are available in a wide range of features and prices. Cheap multimeters can cost less than US$10, while laboratory-grade models with certified [[calibration]] can cost more than US$5,000.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:1920s multimeter 3738-6b.jpg|thumb|1920s Pocket Multimeter]]\n[[File:AVO Model 8 Mk7 P4 by Megger.jpg|thumb|[[Avometer]] Model 8]]\n\nThe first moving-pointer current-detecting device was the [[galvanometer]] in 1820. These were used to measure resistance and voltage by using a [[Wheatstone bridge]], and comparing the unknown quantity to a reference voltage or resistance. While useful in the lab, the devices were very slow and impractical in the field. These galvanometers were bulky and delicate.\n\nThe [[D'Arsonval galvanometer|D'Arsonval/Weston]] meter movement uses a moving coil which carries a pointer and rotates on pivots or a taut band ligament. The coil rotates in a permanent magnetic field and is restrained by fine spiral springs which also serve to carry current into the moving coil. It gives proportional measurement rather than just detection, and deflection is independent of the orientation of the meter. Instead of balancing a bridge, values could be directly read off the instrument's scale, which made measurement quick and easy.\n\nThe basic moving coil meter is suitable only for direct current measurements, usually in the range of 10 microamperes to 100&nbsp;mA. It is easily adapted to read heavier currents by using shunts (resistances in parallel with the basic movement) or to read voltage using series resistances known as multipliers. To read alternating currents or voltages, a rectifier is needed. One of the earliest suitable rectifiers was the copper oxide rectifier developed and manufactured by Union Switch & Signal Company, Swissvale, Pennsylvania, later part of Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company, from 1927.<ref>\u201cA New Electronic Rectifier\u201d , L.O Grondahl & P.H. Geiger, Transactions, American Institution of Electrical Engineers, February 1927 pp. 358 - 366</ref>\n\nMultimeters were invented in the early 1920s as [[radio receiver]]s and other [[vacuum tube]] [[electronic device]]s became more common. The [[invention]] of the first multimeter is attributed to British Post Office engineer, [[Donald Macadie]], who became dissatisfied with the need to carry many separate instruments required for maintenance of [[telecommunication]]s circuits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glias.org.uk/news/237news.html |title=Greater London Industrial Archaeology Society |accessdate=2010-11-02 |work=glias.org.uk}}</ref><!--(The statement that Mr MaCadie became dissatisfied with having to carry many separate instruments is questionable. At the time when the Original Avometer patent (GB200977 - 1923) was granted, he was manager of the Post Office factory in Holloway, London and 50 years old. If he still had occasion to use meters in his work, he would very likely have had an assistant to carry them for him; he may have been very considerate towards his assistants.]<ref>Obituary Wireless World, April 1955</ref>--> Macadie invented an instrument which could measure [[amperes]] (amps), volts and [[ohm]]s, so the multifunctional meter was then named [[Avometer]].<ref name=\"Grace_AVO\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/wiki/Avo |work=gracesguide.co.uk |title=AVO |accessdate=2010-11-02}}</ref> The meter comprised a moving coil meter, voltage and precision resistors, and switches and sockets to select the range.\n\nThe Automatic Coil Winder and Electrical Equipment Company was set up to manufacture the Avometer and a coil winding machine also designed and patented by MacAdie. Although a shareholder of ACWEECO, Mr MacAdie continued to work for the Post Office until his retirement in 1933. His son, Hugh S. MacAdie, joined ACWEECO in 1927 and became Technical Director.<ref>Imperial College Library Archives \u2013 Papers of Donald Macadie 1871 -1956 MS2015/21</ref><ref>The Electrician June 15, 1923, p 666 and</ref>[[Automatic Coil Winder and Electrical Equipment Company]] (ACWEEC, founded in ~1923).<ref name=\"Grace_AVO\" /> The first AVO was put on sale in 1923, and many of its features remained almost unaltered through to the last Model 8.\n\n==General properties of multimeters==\nAny meter will load the circuit under test to some extent. For example,a multimeter using a moving coil movement with full-scale deflection (fsd) current of 50 [[ampere|microamps]], the highest sensitivity commonly available, must draw at least 50 microamps from the circuit under test for fsd. This may load a high-impedance circuit so much as to affect the circuit, and to give a low reading. The full-scale deflection current may also be expressed in terms of \"ohms per volt\" the reciprocal of the fsd current. The ohms per volt figure is often called the \"sensitivity\" of the instrument although the term is not universally accepted as correct. Thus a meter with a 50 microampere will have a \"sensitivity\" of 20,000 ohms per volt.\n\nThe first Avometer had a sensitivity of 60 ohms per volt, three direct current ranges (12&nbsp;mA, 1.2&nbsp;A, and 12&nbsp;A), three direct voltage ranges (12, 120, and 600&nbsp;V or optionally 1200&nbsp;V), and a 10,000&nbsp;ohm resistance range. An improved version of 1927 increased this to 13-ranges and 166.6 ohms per volt (6 mA) movement. A \"Universal\" version having additional alternating current and alternating voltage ranges was offered from 1933 and in 1936 the dual sensitivity Avometer Model 7 offered 500/100 ohms per volt.<ref>Advertisement - The Electrician, 1st June 1934</ref> Between the mid 1930s until the 1950s, 1000 ohms per volt became a de facto standard of sensitivity for radio work and this figure was often quoted on service sheets. However, some manufacturers such as Simpson, Triplett and Weston, all in the USA, produced 20,000 ohm per volt VOMs before the Second World War and some of these were exported. After 1945/6, 20,000 ohms per volt became the expected standard for electronics but some maker offered even more sensitive instruments. For industrial and other \"heavy-current\" use low sensitivity multimeters continued to be produced and these were considered more robust than the more sensitive types.\n\nHigh quality analog (analogue) multimeters are still made by several manufacturers including Chauvin Arnaux (France), Gossen Metrawatt (Germany) and Simpson and Triplett (USA).\n\nPocket watch style meters were in widespread use in the 1920s, at much lower cost than [[Avometer]]s. The metal case was normally connected to the negative connection, an arrangement that caused numerous electric shocks. The technical specifications of these devices were often crude, for example the one illustrated has a [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of just 33 ohms per volt, a [[non-linear]] scale and no zero adjustment.\n\n''Vacuum Tube Voltmeters'' or valve [[voltmeters]] (VTVM, VVM) were used for voltage measurements in electronic circuits where high [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] was necessary. The VTVM had a fixed input impedance of typically 1&nbsp;megohm or more, usually through use of a [[Electronic amplifier#Common terminal|cathode follower]] input circuit, and thus did not significantly load the circuit being tested. VTVMs were used before the introduction of digital electronic high-[[Electrical impedance|impedance]] analog [[transistor]] and [[field effect transistor]] (FET) voltmeters. Modern digital meters and some modern analog meters use electronic input circuitry to achieve high-input impedance&mdash;their voltage ranges are functionally equivalent to VTVMs.\n\nAdditional scales such as [[decibel]]s, and measurement functions such as [[capacitance]], [[transistor gain]], [[frequency]], [[duty cycle]], display hold, and [[buzzer]]s which sound when the measured resistance is small have been included on many multimeters. While multimeters may be supplemented by more specialized equipment in a technician's toolkit, some multimeters include additional functions for specialized applications (temperature with a [[thermocouple]] probe, [[inductance]], connectivity to a [[computer]], speaking measured value, etc.).\n\n==Operation==\n\nA multimeter is a combination of a multirange DC voltmeter, multirange AC voltmeter, multirange [[ammeter]], and multirange [[ohmmeter]]. An un-amplified analog multimeter combines a meter movement, range resistors and switches.\n\nFor an analog meter movement, DC voltage is measured with a series resistor connected between the meter movement and the circuit under test. A set of switches allows greater resistance to be inserted for higher voltage ranges. The product of the basic full-scale deflection current of the movement, and the sum of the series resistance and the movement's own resistance, gives the full-scale voltage of the range. As an example, a meter movement that required 1&nbsp;milliampere for full scale deflection, with an internal resistance of 500&nbsp;ohms, would, on a 10-volt range of the multimeter, have 9,500&nbsp;ohms of series resistance.<ref>Frank Spitzer, Barry Howarth ''Principles of modern instrumentation'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1972 ISBN 0-03-080208-3 pages 32-40</ref>\n\nFor analog current ranges, low-resistance [[Shunt (electrical)|shunts]] are connected in parallel with the meter movement to divert most of the current around the coil. Again for the case of a hypothetical 1&nbsp;mA, 500&nbsp;ohm movement on a 1&nbsp;ampere range, the shunt resistance would be just over 0.5&nbsp;ohms.\n\nMoving coil instruments respond only to the average value of the current through them.  To measure alternating current, a [[rectifier]] diode is inserted in the circuit so that the average value of current is non-zero. Since the rectified average value and the root-mean-square value of a waveform need not be the same, simple rectifier-type circuits may only be calibrated for sinusoidal waveforms.  Other wave shapes require a different calibration factor to relate RMS and average value. Since practical rectifiers have non-zero voltage drop, accuracy and sensitivity is poor at low values.\n\nTo measure resistance, a small battery within the instrument passes a current through the device under test and the meter coil. Since the current available depends on the state of charge of the battery, a multimeter usually has an adjustment for the ohms scale to zero it. In the usual circuit found in analog multimeters, the meter deflection is inversely proportional to the resistance; so full-scale is 0&nbsp;ohms, and high resistance corresponds to smaller deflections.  The ohms scale is compressed, so resolution is better at lower resistance values.\n\nAmplified instruments simplify the design of the series and shunt resistor networks. The internal resistance of the coil is decoupled from the selection of the series and shunt range resistors; the series network becomes a [[voltage divider]]. Where AC measurements are required, the rectifier can be placed after the amplifier stage, improving precision at low range.\n\nDigital instruments, which necessarily incorporate amplifiers, use the same principles as analog instruments for range resistors. For resistance measurements, usually a small constant current is passed through the device under test and the digital multimeter reads the resultant voltage drop; this eliminates the scale compression found in analog meters, but requires a source of significant current. An autoranging digital multimeter can automatically adjust the scaling network so that the measurement uses the full precision of the A/D converter.\n\nIn all types of multimeters, the quality of the switching elements is critical to stable and accurate measurements. Stability of the resistors is a limiting factor in the long-term accuracy and precision of the instrument.\n\n== Quantities measured ==\nContemporary multimeters can measure many quantities. The common ones are:\n* [[Voltage]], [[Alternating current|alternating]] and [[Direct current|direct]], in [[volt]]s.\n* [[Electric current|Current]], alternating and direct, in [[ampere]]s.<br>The [[frequency]] range for which AC measurements are accurate must be specified.\n* [[Electrical resistance|Resistance]] in [[ohm]]s.\nAdditionally, some multimeters measure:\n* [[Capacitor|Capacitance]] in [[farad]]s.\n* [[Electrical conductance|Conductance]] in [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]].\n* [[Decibel]]s.\n* [[Duty cycle]] as a [[percentage]].\n* [[Frequency]] in [[hertz]].\n* [[Inductor|Inductance]] in [[Henry (unit)|henries]].\n* [[Temperature]] in degrees [[Celsius]] or [[Fahrenheit]], with an appropriate temperature [[test probe]], often a [[thermocouple]].\n\nDigital multimeters may also include circuits for:\n*[[Continuity tester]]; sounds when a circuit conducts\n*[[Diode]]s (measuring forward drop of diode junctions),  and [[transistors]] (measuring [[current gain]] and other [[parameters]])\n*Battery checking for simple 1.5-volt and 9-volt batteries. This is a current loaded voltage scale which simulates in-use voltage measurement.\n\nVarious [[sensors]] can be attached to multimeters to take measurements such as:\n* [[Luminance|Light level]]\n* [[pH|Acidity/Alkalinity(pH)]]\n* [[Relative humidity]]\n\n==Resolution==\n\n===Resolution and accuracy===\nThe resolution of a multimeter is the smallest part of the scale which can be shown, which is scale dependent. On some digital multimeters it can be configured, with higher resolution measurements taking longer to complete. For example, a multimeter that has a 1&nbsp;mV resolution on a 10&nbsp;V scale can show changes in measurements in 1&nbsp;mV increments.\n\nAbsolute accuracy is the error of the measurement compared to a perfect measurement. Relative accuracy is the error of the measurement compared to the device used to calibrate the multimeter. Most multimeter datasheets provide relative accuracy. To compute the absolute accuracy from the relative accuracy of a multimeter add the absolute accuracy of the device used to calibrate the multimeter to the relative accuracy of the multimeter.<ref name=\"Keithley Instruments\">{{cite web|title=Model 2002 Multimeter Specifications|url=http://www.keithley.com/data?asset=5799|publisher=Keithley Instruments}}</ref>\n\n===Digital===\nThe resolution of a multimeter is often specified in the number of decimal [[Numerical digit|digits]] [[Sensor resolution|resolved]] and displayed. If the most significant digit cannot take all values from 0 to 9 is often termed a fractional digit. For example, a multimeter which can read up to 19999 (plus an embedded decimal point) is said to read 4\u00bd digits.\n\nBy convention, if the most significant digit can be either 0 or 1, it is termed a half-digit; if it can take higher values without reaching 9 (often 3 or 5), it may be called three-quarters of a digit. A 5\u00bd digit multimeter would display one \"half digit\" that could only display 0 or 1, followed by five digits taking all values from 0 to 9.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/tut/p/id/3295|accessdate=2008-01-26|title=Digital Multimeter Measurement Fundamentals|publisher=National Instruments}}</ref> Such a meter could show positive or negative values from 0 to 199,999. A 3\u00be digit meter can display a quantity from 0 to 3,999 or 5,999, depending on the manufacturer.\n\nWhile a digital display can easily be extended in [[Accuracy and precision|precision]], the extra digits are of no value if not accompanied by care in the design and calibration of the analog portions of the multimeter. Meaningful high-resolution measurements require a good understanding of the instrument specifications, good control of the measurement conditions, and traceability of the calibration of the instrument. However, even if its resolution exceeds the [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]], a meter can be useful for comparing measurements. For example, a meter reading 5\u00bd stable digits may indicate that one nominally 100,000 ohm resistor is about 7 ohms greater than another, although the error of each measurement is 0.2% of reading plus 0.05% of full-scale value.\n\nSpecifying \"display counts\" is another way to specify the resolution. Display counts give the largest number, or the largest number plus one (so the count number looks nicer) the multimeter's display can show, ignoring a [[decimal separator]]. For example, a 5\u00bd digit multimeter can also be specified as a 199999 display count or 200000 display count multimeter. Often the display count is just called the count in multimeter specifications.\n\nThe accuracy of a digital multimeter may be stated in a two-term form, such as \"\u00b11% of reading +2 counts\", reflecting the different sources of error in the instrument.<ref>Stephen A. Dyer, ''Wiley Survey of Instrumentation and Measurement', John Wiley & Sons, 2004 \nISBN 0471221651, p. 290</ref>\n\n===Analog===\n[[File:Multimeter-4269.jpg|thumb|right|Display face of an analog multimeter]]\nAnalog meters are older and still preferred by many engineers. One reason for this is that analog meters are more sensitive to changes in the circuit that is being measured. A digital multimeter samples the quantity being measured and then displays it. Analog multimeters continuously read the test value. If there are slight changes in readings, the needle of an analog multimeter will track them while digital multimeters may miss them or be difficult to read. This continuous tracking feature becomes important when testing capacitors or coils. A properly functioning capacitor should allow current to flow when voltage is applied, then the current slowly decreases to zero and this \"signature\" is easy to see on an analog multimeter but not on a digital multimeter. This is similar when testing a coil, except the current starts low and increases.\n\nResistance measurements on an analog meter, in particular, are of low precision due to the typical resistance measurement circuit which compresses the scale heavily at the higher resistance values. Inexpensive analog meters may have only a single resistance scale, seriously restricting the range of precise measurements. Typically an analog meter will have a panel adjustment to set the zero-ohms calibration of the meter, to compensate for the varying voltage of the meter battery.\n\n==Accuracy==\nDigital multimeters generally take measurements with [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]] superior to their analog counterparts. Standard analog multimeters measure with typically \u00b13% accuracy,<ref>{{cite book\n|publisher=McGraw-Hill\n|title=Handbook of electronics calculations for engineers and technicians\n|author=Milton Kaufman\n}}</ref> though instruments of higher accuracy are made. Standard portable digital multimeters are specified to have an accuracy of typically \u00b10.5% on the DC voltage ranges. Mainstream bench-top multimeters are available with specified accuracy of better than \u00b10.01%. [[Laboratory grade]] instruments can have accuracies of a few [[parts per million]].<ref>{{cite web\n|last=Agilent Technologies |url=http://cp.literature.agilent.com/litweb/pdf/5965-4971E.pdf |accessdate = 2007-01-28 |title=Agilent 3458A Digital Multimeter Data Sheet}}</ref>\n\nAccuracy figures need to be interpreted with care. The accuracy of an analog instrument usually refers to full-scale deflection; a measurement of 30&nbsp;V on the 100&nbsp;V scale of a 3% meter is subject to an error of 3&nbsp;V, 10% of the reading. Digital meters usually specify accuracy as a percentage of reading plus a percentage of full-scale value, sometimes expressed in counts rather than percentage terms.\n\nQuoted accuracy is specified as being that of the lower millivolt (mV) DC range, and is known as the \"basic DC volts accuracy\" figure. Higher DC voltage ranges, current, resistance, AC and other ranges will usually have a lower accuracy than the basic DC volts figure. AC measurements only meet specified accuracy within a specified range of [[frequencies]].\n\nManufacturers can provide [[calibration]] services so that new meters may be purchased with a certificate of calibration indicating the meter has been adjusted to standards traceable to, for example, the US [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), or other national [[standards organization]].\n\nTest equipment tends to [[Electronic drift|drift]] out of calibration over time, and the specified accuracy cannot be relied upon indefinitely. For more expensive equipment, manufacturers and third parties provide calibration services so that older equipment may be recalibrated and recertified. The cost of such services is disproportionate for inexpensive equipment; however extreme accuracy is not required for most routine testing. Multimeters used for critical measurements may be part of a [[metrology]] program to assure calibration.\n\nA multimeter can be assumed to be \"average responding\" to AC waveforms unless stated as being a \"True RMS\" type.\nAn average responding multimeter will only meet its specified accuracy on AC volts and amps for purely sinusoidal waveforms.\nA True RMS responding multimeter on the other hand will meet its specified accuracy on AC volts and current with any waveform type up to a specified [[crest factor]].\n\nA meter's AC voltage and current accuracy may have different specifications for different ranges of frequency.\n\n==Sensitivity and input impedance==\n{{anchor|Sensitivity and input impedance}}\nWhen used for measuring voltage, the input impedance of the multimeter must be very high compared to the impedance of the circuit being measured; otherwise circuit operation may be changed, and the reading will also be inaccurate.\n\nMeters with electronic amplifiers (all digital multimeters and some analog meters) have a fixed input impedance that is high enough not to disturb most circuits. This is often either one or ten [[megohm]]s; the [[standardization]] of the input resistance allows the use of external high-resistance [[Test probe|probes]] which form a [[voltage divider]] with the input resistance to extend voltage range up to tens of thousands of volts.  High-end multimeters generally provide an input impedance >10&nbsp;Gigaohms for ranges less than or equal to 10&nbsp;V.  Some high-end multimeters provide >10&nbsp;Gigaohms of impedance to ranges greater than 10&nbsp;V.<ref name=\"Keithley Instruments\"/>\n\nMost analog multimeters of the moving-pointer type are [[Buffer amplifier|unbuffered]], and draw current from the circuit under test to deflect the meter pointer. The [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the meter varies depending on the basic sensitivity of the meter movement and the range which is selected. For example, a meter with a typical 20,000&nbsp;ohms/volt sensitivity will have an input resistance of two million ohms on the 100-volt range (100 V * 20,000 ohms/volt = 2,000,000 ohms). On every range, at full scale voltage of the range, the full current required to deflect the meter movement is taken from the circuit under test. Lower sensitivity meter movements are acceptable for testing in circuits where source impedances are low compared to the meter impedance, for example, [[power circuits]]; these meters are more rugged mechanically. Some measurements in signal circuits require higher sensitivity movements so as not to load the circuit under test with the meter impedance.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]/TAB Electronics|title=How to Test Almost Everything Electronic|first=Delton|last=Horn|pages=4\u20136|year=1993|isbn=0-8306-4127-0}}</ref>\n\nSensitivity should not be confused with [[Sensor resolution|resolution]] of a meter, which is defined as the lowest signal change (voltage, current, resistance...) that can change the observed reading.\n\nFor general-purpose digital multimeters, the lowest voltage range is typically several hundred millivolts AC or DC, but the lowest current range may be several hundred microamperes, although instruments with greater current sensitivity are available. Multimeters designed for (mains) \"electrical\" use instead of general [[electronics engineering]] use will typically forego the microamps current ranges.\n\nMeasurement of low resistance requires lead resistance (measured by touching the test probes together) to be subtracted for best accuracy. This can be done with the \"delta\", \"Zero\", or \"null\" feature of many digital multimeters.\n\nThe upper end of multimeter measurement ranges varies considerably; measurements over perhaps 600&nbsp;volts, 10&nbsp;amperes, or 100&nbsp;[[Ohm|megohms]] may require a specialized test instrument.\n\n==Burden voltage==\nAny ammeter, including a multimeter in a current range, has a certain resistance. Most multimeters inherently measure voltage, and pass a current to be measured through a [[shunt resistance]], measuring the voltage developed across it. The voltage drop is known as the burden voltage, specified in volts per ampere. The value can change depending on the range the meter selects, since different ranges usually use different shunt resistors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://us.fluke.com/fluke/usen/community/fluke+plus/articlecategories/electrical/burdenvoltage.htm |title=Explanation of burden voltage by multimeter manufacturer Fluke |publisher=[[Fluke Corporation|Fluke]] |accessdate=2010-11-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | work = eevblog.com | url = http://www.eevblog.com/projects/ucurrent/ | accessdate = 2015-01-20 | title = \u00b5Current EEVblog - The Electronics Engineering Video Blog}}</ref>\n\nThe burden voltage can be significant in very low-voltage circuit areas. To check for its effect on accuracy and on external circuit operation the meter can be switched to different ranges; the current reading should be the same and circuit operation should not be affected if burden voltage is not a problem. If this voltage is significant it can be reduced (also reducing the inherent accuracy and precision of the measurement) by using a higher current range.\n\n==Alternating current sensing==\nSince the basic indicator system in either an analog or digital meter responds to DC only, a multimeter includes an AC to DC conversion circuit for making alternating current measurements. Basic meters utilize a [[Rectifier|rectifier circuit]] to measure the average or peak absolute value of the voltage, but are calibrated to show the calculated [[root mean square]] (RMS) value for a [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]al [[waveform]]; this will give correct readings for alternating current as used in power distribution. User guides for some such meters give [[correction factor]]s for some simple non-[[Sine wave|sinusoid]]al [[waveform]]s, to allow the correct [[root mean square]] (RMS) equivalent value to be calculated. More expensive multimeters include an AC to DC converter that measures the true RMS value of the waveform within certain limits; the user manual for the meter may indicate the limits of the [[crest factor]] and frequency for which the meter calibration is valid. RMS sensing is necessary for measurements on non-sinusoidal [[Period (physics)|periodic]] waveforms, such as found in audio signals and [[variable-frequency drive]]s.\n\n==Digital multimeters (DMM or DVOM)==\n[[File:Benchtop multimeter.jpg|thumb|250px|A bench-top multimeter, the [[Hewlett-Packard]] 34401a.]]\nModern multimeters are often digital due to their accuracy, durability and extra features. In a digital multimeter the signal under test is converted to a voltage and an amplifier with electronically controlled gain preconditions the signal. A digital multimeter displays the quantity measured as a number, which eliminates [[parallax]] errors.\n\nModern digital multimeters may have an [[embedded system|embedded computer]], which provides a wealth of convenience features. Measurement enhancements available include:\n\n*'''Auto-ranging''', which selects the correct range for the quantity under test so that the most [[significant digits]] are shown. For example, a four-digit multimeter would automatically select an appropriate range to display 1.234 instead of 0.012, or overloading. Auto-ranging meters usually include a facility to hold the meter to a particular range, because a measurement that causes frequent range changes can be distracting to the user.\n*'''Auto-polarity''' for direct-current readings, shows if the applied voltage is positive (agrees with meter lead labels) or negative (opposite polarity to meter leads).\n*'''[[Sample and hold]]''', which will latch the most recent reading for examination after the instrument is removed from the circuit under test.\n*Current-limited tests for [[voltage drop]] across [[P-n junction|semiconductor junctions]]. While not a replacement for a [[transistor tester]], this facilitates testing diodes and a variety of transistor types.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hewes|first=John|url=http://electronicsclub.info/multimeters.htm#diode|title=Testing a diode with a multimeter|accessdate=2015-01-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Goldwasser|first=Samuel|\nurl=http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/semitest.htm#stttm|title=Basic Testing of Semiconductor Devices|accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref>\n*A '''graphic representation''' of the quantity under test, as a [[bar graph]].

Analog multimeters are common; a quality analog instrument will cost about the same as a DMM. Analog multimeters have the precision and reading accuracy limitations described above, and so are not built to provide the same accuracy as digital instruments.\n\nAnalog meters are also useful where the trend of a measurement is more important than an exact value obtained at a particular moment. A change in angle or in a proportion is easier to interpret than a change in a digital readout.{{cn|date=November 2016}} For this reason, digital multimeters often approximate this with a bargraph (typically with a more rapid reading response than the primary readout); the most effective of these are arranged in an arc, to simulate the pointer of an analog meter. \n\nAnalog meter movements are inherently more fragile physically and electrically than digital meters. Many analog multimeters feature a range switch position marked \"off\" to protect the meter movement during transportation which places placing a low resistance across the meter movement, resulting in [[dynamic braking]]. Meter movements as separate components may be protected in the same manner by connecting a shorting or jumper wire between the terminals when not in use. Meters which feature a shunt across the winding such as an ammeter may not require further resistance to arrest uncontrolled movements of the meter needle because of the low resistance of the shunt.\n\nThe meter movement in a moving pointer analog multimeter is practically always a moving-coil [[galvanometer]] of the [[d'Arsonval]] type, using either jeweled pivots or taut bands to support the moving coil. In a basic analog multimeter the current to deflect the coil and pointer is drawn from the circuit being measured; it is usually an advantage to minimize the current drawn from the circuit, which implies delicate mechanisms. The sensitivity of an analog multimeter is given in units of ohms per volt. For example, a very low cost multimeter with a sensitivity of 1000 ohms per volt would draw 1&nbsp;milliampere from a circuit at full scale deflection.<ref>Frank Spitzer and Barry Horwath ''Principles of Modern Instrumentation'', Holt, Rinehart and Winston Inc., New York 1972, no ISBN, Library of Congress 72-77731, page 39</ref> More expensive, (and mechanically more delicate) multimeters typically have sensitivities of 20,000 ohms per volt and sometimes higher, with 50,000 ohms per volt (drawing 20&nbsp;microamperes at full scale) being about the upper limit for a portable, general purpose, non-amplified analog multimeter.\n\nTo avoid the loading of the measured circuit by the current drawn by the meter movement, some analog multimeters use an amplifier inserted between the measured circuit and the meter movement. While this increases the expense and complexity of the meter, by use of [[vacuum tube]]s or [[field effect transistor]]s the input resistance can be made very high and independent of the current required to operate the meter movement coil. Such amplified multimeters are called VTVMs (vacuum tube voltmeters),<ref>{{cite web | work = tone-lizard.com | url = http://www.tone-lizard.com/VTVM.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-28 | title = The Incomplete Idiot's Guide to VTVMs }}</ref> TVMs (transistor volt meters), FET-VOMs, and similar names.\n\nBecause of the absence of amplification, ordinary analog multimeter are typically less susceptible to [[radio frequency interference]], and so continue to have a prominent place in some fields even in a world of more accurate and flexible electronic multimeters.<ref>{{cite book|title=The ARRL Handbook for Radio Communications|year=2008|isbn=0-87259-101-8|last=Wilson|first=Mark}}</ref>\n\n==Probes==\n{{main|Test probe}}\n\nA multimeter can use many different est probes to connect to the circuit or device under test. [[Crocodile clip]]s, retractable hook clips, and pointed probes are the three most common types. [[Tweezer#Types|Tweezer probes]] are used for closely spaced test points, as for instance [[surface-mount device]]s. The connectors are attached to flexible, well insulated leads terminated with connectors appropriate for the meter. Probes are connected to portable meters typically by shrouded or recessed [[Banana connector|banana jacks]], while benchtop meters may use [[banana jacks]] or [[BNC connector]]s. 2&nbsp;mm plugs and [[binding posts]] have also been used at times, but are less commonly today.  Indeed, safety ratings now require shrouded banana jacks.\n\nThe banana jacks are typically placed with a standardized center-to-center distance of {{convert|0.75|inch|mm|lk=on|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}, to allow standard adapters or devices such as voltage multiplier or thermocouple probes to be plugged in.\n\n[[Clamp meter]]s clamp around a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] carrying a current to measure without the need to connect the meter in series with the circuit, or make metallic contact at all. Those for AC measurement  use the transformer principle; clamp-on meters to measure small current or direct current require more exotic sensors.\n\n==Safety==\n[[File:Fluke 28 Multimeter Input Protection.jpg|right|thumb|An example of input protection on the CAT-IV rated Fluke 28 Series II Multimeter]]\nMost multimeters include a [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]], or two fuses, which will sometimes prevent damage to the multimeter from a current overload on the highest current range. (For added safety, test leads with fuses built in are available.) A common error when operating a multimeter is to set the meter to measure resistance or current, and then connect it directly to a low-impedance voltage source. Unfused meters are often quickly destroyed by such errors; fused meters often survive. Fuses used in meters must carry the maximum measuring current of the instrument, but are intended to disconnect if operator error exposes the meter to a low-impedance fault. Meters with inadequate or unsafe fusing were not uncommon; this situation has led to the creation of the [[Measurement category|IEC61010 categories]] to rate the safety and robustness of meters.\n\nDigital meters are rated into four categories based on their intended application, as set forth by IEC 61010-1<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gossenmetrawatt.com/english/seiten/newsafetystandardiec61010-1since0.htm|title=Safety Standard IEC 61010-1 since 1.1.2004}}</ref> and echoed by country and regional standards groups such as the [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] EN61010 standard.<ref>{{cite book|title=Safety requirements for electrical equipment for measurement, control and laboratory use.

Explosion of internal components is possible, as is overheating and fire.  Indeed, good safety provisions are one of the most important aspects of high quality multimeters.\n\n==DMM alternatives==\n\nA quality general-purpose electronics DMM is generally considered adequate for measurements at signal levels greater than one millivolt or one microampere, or below about 100 megohms;  these values are far from the theoretical limits of sensitivity, and are of considerable interest in some circuit design situations. Other instruments&mdash;essentially similar, but with higher sensitivity&mdash;are used for accurate measurements of very small or very large quantities. These include nanovoltmeters, [[electrometer]]s (for very low currents, and voltages with very high source resistance, such as one teraohm) and [[Ammeter#Picoammeter|picoammeters]], and accessories for more common multimeters which permit some of these measurements. Such measurements are limited by available technology, and ultimately by inherent [[thermal noise]].\n\n==Power supply==\n\nAnalog meters can measure voltage and current using power from the test circuit, but require an internal voltage source for resistance testing; electronic meters always require an internal power supply to run its internal circuitry.  Hand-held meters use batteries, while bench meters usually use mains power; either arrangement allows the meter to test devices. Testing often requires that the component under test be isolated from the circuit, as otherwise stray or leakage current paths may distort measurements.  In some cases, the voltage from the multimeter may turn active devices on, distorting a measurement, or in extreme cases even damage an element in the circuit being investigated. It is safest (for both multimeter and circuit under test) to disconnect a component from its circuit, and almost always, to remove power from the device being investigated.\n\nMeters intended for testing in [[Electrical equipment in hazardous areas|hazardous locations]] or for use on [[Blasting machine|blasting circuits]] may require use of a manufacturer-specified battery to maintain their safety rating.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Ammeter]]\n* [[Avometer]]\n* [[Electronic test equipment]]\n* [[Ohmmeter]]\n* [[Voltmeter]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|multimeter}}\n{{Commons category|Multimeters}}\n* [https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter How to use a multimeter], sparkfun\n* [http://afrotechmods.com/tutorials/2011/11/27/multimeter-tutorial/ High definition multimeter tutorial video]\n* [http://cp.literature.agilent.com/litweb/pdf/5990-5197EN.pdf How to select a Multimeter] - Discusses the key considerations to select the right multimeter.\n* [http://www.robotplatform.com/tools/multimeter/multimeter.html Multimeter Tutorial] - Lots of useful information on Digital multimeter usage.\n* [http://www.jbryant.eu/pages/DMM.htm Beginners' Guide to the 830B Multimeter] - Discusses the many uses of a cheap digital multimeter in the home.\n* [http://www.designworldonline.com/articles/5416/260/How-to-Determine-Digital-Multimeter-Accuracy.aspx How to Determine Digital Multimeter Accuracy]\n* [http://support.fluke.com/find-sales/download/asset/1263690_6116_eng_h_w.pdf ABCs of Multimeter safety] - (PDF)\n* [http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/t_and_m/digital-multimeter/dmm-basics-tutorial.php Digital Multimeter] - From theory to use\n* [https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/test-methods/meters/multimeter-test-meter-basics-tutorial.php Multimeters and How to Use Them]\n* [http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/DC/DC_8.html ''DC Metering Circuits''] chapter from [http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/DC/index.html ''Lessons In Electric Circuits Vol 1 DC''] free ebook and [http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/ ''Lessons In Electric Circuits''] series.\n\n{{Electrical and electronic measuring equipment}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Electronic test equipment]]\n[[Category:Electrical test equipment]]\n[[Category:Electrical meters]]\n[[Category:Electronics work tools]]\n[[Category:Measuring instruments]]"}]}}}}
