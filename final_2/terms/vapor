(The dotted green line gives the anomalous behaviour of water.)]]\n''Vapor'' refers to a gas phase at a temperature where the same substance can also exist in the [[liquid]] or [[solid]] state, below the [[critical temperature]] of the substance. (For example, water has a critical temperature of 374&nbsp;\u00b0C (647 K), which is the highest temperature at which liquid water can exist.) If the vapor is in contact with a liquid or solid phase, the two phases will be in a state of [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. The term ''gas'' refers to a compressible fluid phase. Fixed gases are gases for which no liquid or solid can form at the temperature of the gas, such as air at typical ambient temperatures. A liquid or solid does not have to boil to release a vapor.\n\nVapor is responsible for the familiar processes of [[cloud]] formation and [[condensation]]. It is commonly employed to carry out the physical processes of [[distillation]] and [[headspace technology|headspace extraction]] from a liquid sample prior to [[gas chromatography]].\n\nThe constituent [[molecule]]s of a vapor possess vibrational, rotational, and translational motion. These motions are considered in the [[kinetic theory of gases]].\n\n==Vapor pressure==\n{{Main|Vapor pressure}}\n[[File:Binary Boiling Point Diagram new.svg|left|thumb|Liquid\u2013vapor equilibrium]]\nThe [[vapor pressure]] is the equilibrium pressure from a liquid or a solid at a specific temperature.  The equilibrium vapor pressure of a liquid or solid is not affected by the amount of contact with the liquid or solid interface.\n\nThe [[normal boiling point]] of a liquid is the [[temperature]] at which the [[vapor pressure]] is equal to [[atmosphere (unit)|normal atmospheric pressure]].<ref name=Petrucci/>\n\nFor two-phase systems (e.g., two liquid phases), the vapor pressure of the individual phases are equal.  In the absence of stronger inter-species attractions between like-like or like-unlike molecules, the vapor pressure follows [[Raoult's Law]], which states that the [[partial pressure]] of each component is the product of the vapor pressure of the pure component and its mole fraction in the mixture. The total vapor pressure is the sum of the component partial pressures.<ref>Thomas Engel and Philip Reid, ''Physical Chemistry,'' Pearson Benjamin-Cummings, 2006, p.194</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:Crepuscular Rays Beam through the Mist Blown from Takkakaw Falls.jpg|thumb|Water vapor is responsible for humidity]]\n\n* [[Perfume]]s contain chemicals that vaporize at different temperatures and at different rate in scent accords known as [[note (perfumery)|note]]s.\n* [[Earth's atmosphere|Atmospheric]] [[water vapor]] is found near the earth's surface, and may condense into small liquid droplets and form meteorological phenomena such as [[fog]], [[mist]] and [[haar (fog)|haar]].\n* [[Mercury-vapor lamp]]s and [[sodium vapor lamp]]s produce light from atoms in [[excited state]]s.\n* [[Flammable liquid]]s do not burn when ignited.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} It is the vapor cloud above the liquid that will burn if the vapor's concentration is between the [[lower flammable limit]] (LFL) and upper flammable limit (UFL) of the flammable liquid.\n*[[E-Cigarettes]] allow users to inhale \"[[e-liquid]]\" [[aerosol]]/vapor, rather than [[cigarette smoke]].<ref name=\"Cheng2014\">{{cite journal|last1=Cheng|first1=T.|title=Chemical evaluation of electronic cigarettes|journal=Tobacco Control|volume=23|issue=Supplement 2|year=2014|pages=ii11\u2013ii17|issn=0964-4563|doi=10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2013-051482|pmc=3995255|pmid=24732157}}</ref>\n\n==Measuring vapor==\nSince it is in the gas phase, the amount of vapor present is quantified by the [[partial pressure]] of the gas.
