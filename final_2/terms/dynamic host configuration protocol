The DHCP is controlled by a DHCP server that dynamically distributes network configuration parameters, such as [[IP address]]es, for interfaces and services. A [[Router (computing)|router]] or a [[residential gateway]] can be enabled to act as a DHCP server. A DHCP server enables computers to request IP addresses and networking parameters automatically, reducing the need for a [[network administrator]] or a user to configure these settings manually. In the absence of a DHCP server, each computer or other device (eg., a printer) on the network needs to be statically (ie., manually) assigned to an IP address.\n\n=={{Anchor|LEASE}}Overview==\n[[TCP/IP]] defines how devices on one network communicate with devices on another network. A DHCP server can manage TCP/IP settings for devices on a network, by automatically or dynamically assigning Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to the devices. {{As of|2011}}, networks ranging in size from [[home network]]s to large [[campus network]]s and regional [[Internet service provider]] networks commonly use DHCP.<ref>Peterson LL, Davie BS. (2011). [https://books.google.com/books?id=BvaFreun1W8C&pg=PA372&lpg=PA372 Computer Networks: A Systems Approach].</ref> Most residential network routers receive a globally unique IP address within the provider network. Within a local network, a DHCP server assigns a local IP address to each device connected to the network.\n\nThe DHCP operates based on the [[client\u2013server model]]. When a computer or other device connects to a network, the DHCP client software sends a [[Broadcasting (computing)|broadcast]] query requesting the necessary information. Any DHCP server on the network may service the request. The DHCP server manages a pool of IP addresses and information about client configuration parameters such as [[default gateway]], [[domain name]], the [[name server]]s, and [[time server]]s. On receiving a request, the server may respond with specific information for each client, as previously configured by an administrator, or with a specific address and any other information valid for the entire network and for the time period for which the allocation (''lease'') is valid. A client typically queries for this information immediately after [[booting]], and periodically thereafter before the expiration of the information. When a DHCP client refreshes an assignment, it initially requests the same parameter values, but the DHCP server may assign a new address based on the assignment policies set by administrators.\n\nOn large networks that consist of multiple links, a single DHCP server may service the entire network when aided by DHCP relay agents located on the interconnecting routers. Such agents relay messages between DHCP clients and DHCP servers located on different subnets.\n\nDepending on implementation, the DHCP server may have three methods of allocating IP addresses:\n;Dynamic allocation: A [[network administrator]] reserves a range of IP addresses for DHCP, and each DHCP client on the LAN is configured to request an IP address from the DHCP [[Server (computing)|server]] during network initialization. The request-and-grant process uses a lease concept with a controllable time period, allowing the DHCP server to reclaim (and then reallocate) IP addresses that are not renewed.\n;Automatic allocation: The DHCP server permanently assigns an IP address to a requesting client from the range defined by the administrator. This is like dynamic allocation, but the DHCP server keeps a table of past IP address assignments, so that it can preferentially assign to a client the same IP address that the client previously had.\n;Manual allocation (commonly called static allocation): The DHCP server is disabled and the administrator allocates a private IP address based on a preconfigured mapping to each client's [[MAC address]]. This feature is variously called ''static DHCP assignment'' by [[DD-WRT]], ''fixed-address'' by the dhcpd documentation, ''address reservation'' by Netgear, ''DHCP reservation'' or ''static DHCP'' by [[Cisco]] and [[Linksys]], and ''IP address reservation'' or ''MAC/IP address binding'' by various other router manufacturers.\n\nDHCP is used for [[IPv4|Internet Protocol version 4]] (IPv4), as well as for [[IPv6]]. While both versions serve the same purpose, the details of the protocol for IPv4 and IPv6 differ sufficiently that they may be considered separate protocols.<ref>{{cite book |title = The DHCP Handbook |year = 2003 |isbn = 0-672-32327-3 |author = Ralph Droms |author2 = Ted Lemon |publisher = [[SAMS Publishing]] |page = 436 }}</ref> For the [[IPv6]] operation, devices may alternatively use [[IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration|stateless address autoconfiguration]]. IPv6 hosts may also use [[link-local addressing]] to achieve operations restricted to the local network link.\n\n==History==\nIn 1984, the Reverse Address Resolution Protocol ([[RARP]]), defined in RFC 903, was introduced to allow simple devices such as [[diskless workstation]]s to dynamically obtain a suitable IP address. However, because it acted at the [[data link layer]] it made implementation difficult on many server platforms, and also required that a server be present on each individual network link. RARP was superseded by the Bootstrap Protocol ([[BOOTP]]) defined in RFC 951 in September 1985. This introduced the concept of a ''relay agent'', which allowed the forwarding of BOOTP packets across networks, allowing one central BOOTP server to serve hosts on many IP subnets.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc951#section-6 |title = RFC 951 - Bootstrap Protocol |author = Bill Croft |author2 = John Gilmore |date = September 1985 |work = Network Working Group }}</ref>\n\nDHCP is based on BOOTP but can dynamically allocate IP addresses from a pool and reclaim them when they are no longer in use. It can also be used to deliver a wide range of extra configuration parameters to IP clients, including platform-specific parameters.<ref name=\"Network+ certification\">Network+ Certification 2006 Published By Microsoft Press.</ref> DHCP was first defined in RFC 1531 in October 1993; but due to errors in the editorial process was almost immediately reissued as RFC 1541.\n\nFour years later the DHCPINFORM message type<ref>used for the Web Proxy Autodiscovery Protocol [[Web Proxy Autodiscovery Protocol|WPAD]]</ref> and other small changes were added by RFC 2131; which {{as of | 2014 | lc = on}} remains the standard for IPv4 networks.\n\n[[DHCPv6]] was initially described by RFC 3315 in 2003, but this has been updated by many subsequent RFCs.<ref>RFC 4361, RFC 5494, RFC 6221, RFC 6422, RFC 6644, RFC 7083, RFC 7227, RFC 7283</ref> RFC 3633 added a DHCPv6 mechanism for [[prefix delegation]], and [[stateless address autoconfiguration]]  was added by RFC 3736.\n\n==Operation==\n[[File:DHCP session.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|An illustration of a typical non-renewing DHCP session; each message may be either a broadcast or a unicast, depending on the DHCP client capabilities.<ref>[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131#section-4.1 RFC 2131, Section 4.1 Constructing and sending DHCP messages]</ref>]]\n\nThe DHCP employs a [[Connectionless communication|connectionless]] service model, using the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP). It is implemented with two UDP port numbers for its operations which are the same as for the [[BOOTP]] protocol. UDP port number 67 is the destination port of a server, and UDP port number 68 is used by the client.\n\nDHCP operations fall into four phases: server discovery, IP lease offer, IP lease request, and IP lease acknowledgement. These stages are often abbreviated as DORA for discovery, offer, request, and acknowledgement.\n\nThe DHCP operation begins with clients [[Broadcasting (computing)|broadcasting]] a request. If the client and server are on different subnets, a [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol#DHCP relaying|DHCP Helper or DHCP Relay Agent]] may be used. Clients requesting renewal of an existing lease may communicate directly via UDP [[unicast]], since the client already has an established IP address at that point. Additionally, there is a BOOTP flag the client can use to indicate in which way (broadcast or unicast) it can receive the DHCPOFFER: 0x8000 for broadcast, 0x0000 for unicast.<ref>{{Cite web |title = Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol |url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131#section-4.1 |website = tools.ietf.org |accessdate = 2015-12-26 |first = Ralph |last = Droms }}</ref> Only hosts with preconfigured IP addresses can receive unicast packets so in the usual use case clients in discovery phase should set BOOTP flag to 0x8000 (broadcast).\n\n===DHCP discovery===\nThe client broadcasts messages on the network subnet using the destination address 255.255.255.255 or the specific subnet broadcast address.  A DHCP client may also request its last-known IP address. If the client remains connected to the same network, the server may grant the request. Otherwise, it depends whether the server is set up as authoritative or not. An authoritative server denies the request, causing the client to issue a new request. A non-authoritative server simply ignores the request, leading to an implementation-dependent timeout for the client to expire the request and ask for a new IP address. \n\n'''Below is an example.''' HTYPE is set to 1 to specify that the medium used is [[ethernet]], HLEN is set to 6 because an ethernet address (MAC address) is 6 octets long. The CHADDR is set to the MAC address used by the client. Some options are set as well.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example DHCPDISCOVER message\n|-\n| colspan=4 |\nIP: source=0.0.0.0; destination=255.255.255.255 <br/>\n[[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]: source port=68; destination port=67\n|-\n!

As client devices usually do not know when users may unplug them from the network, the protocol does not mandate the sending of ''DHCP Release''.\n\n==Client configuration parameters==\nA DHCP server can provide optional configuration parameters to the client.

The information is a variable-length string of characters or octets which has a meaning specified by the vendor of the DHCP client. One method that a DHCP client can utilize to communicate to the server that it is using a certain type of hardware or firmware is to set a value in its DHCP requests called the Vendor Class Identifier (VCI) (Option 60).\n\nThis method allows a DHCP server to differentiate between the two kinds of client machines and process the requests from the two types of modems appropriately. Some types of set-top boxes also set the VCI (Option 60) to inform the DHCP server about the hardware type and functionality of the device. The value this option is set to gives the DHCP server a hint about any required extra information that this client needs in a DHCP response.\n\n==DHCP relaying==\nIn small networks, where only one IP subnet is being managed, DHCP clients communicate directly with DHCP servers.  However, DHCP servers can also provide IP addresses for multiple subnets.  In this case, a DHCP client that has not yet acquired an IP address cannot communicate directly with the DHCP server using IP routing, because it does not have a routable IP address, nor does it know the IP address of a router.\n\nIn order to allow DHCP clients on subnets not directly served by DHCP servers to communicate with DHCP servers, DHCP relay agents can be installed on these subnets.  The DHCP client broadcasts on the local link; the relay agent receives the broadcast and transmits it to one or more DHCP servers using [[unicast]].  The relay agent stores its own IP address in the GIADDR field of the DHCP packet.  The DHCP server uses the GIADDR to determine the subnet on which the relay agent received the broadcast, and allocates an IP address on that subnet.  When the DHCP server replies to the client, it sends the reply to the GIADDR address, again using unicast.  The relay agent then retransmits the response on the local network.\n\n==Reliability==\nThe DHCP ensures reliability in several ways: periodic renewal, rebinding,<ref name=rfc2131/>{{rp|Section 4.4.5}} and failover.   DHCP clients are allocated leases that last for some period of time.   Clients begin to attempt to renew their leases once half the lease interval has expired.<ref name=rfc2131/>{{rp|Section 4.4.5 Paragraph 3}}   They do this by sending a unicast DHCPREQUEST message to the DHCP server that granted the original lease.   If that server is down or unreachable, it will fail to respond to the DHCPREQUEST.   However, in that case the client repeats the DHCPREQUEST from time to time,<ref name=rfc2131/>{{rp|Section 4.4.5 Paragraph 8}}{{Efn|The RFC calls for the client to wait one half of the remaining time until T2 before it retransmits the DHCPREQUEST packet}} so if the DHCP server comes back up or becomes reachable again, the DHCP client will succeed in contacting it and renew the lease.\n\nIf the DHCP server is unreachable for an extended period of time,<ref name=rfc2131/>{{rp|Section 4.4.5 Paragraph 5}} the DHCP client will attempt to rebind, by broadcasting its DHCPREQUEST rather than unicasting it.   Because it is broadcast, the DHCPREQUEST message will reach all available DHCP servers.   If some other DHCP server is able to renew the lease, it will do so at this time.\n\nIn order for rebinding to work, when the client successfully contacts a backup DHCP server, that server must have accurate information about the client's binding.   Maintaining accurate binding information between two servers is a complicated problem; if both servers are able to update the same lease database, there must be a mechanism to avoid conflicts between updates on the independent servers.   A proposal for implementing [[Fault-tolerant design|fault-tolerant]] DHCP servers was submitted{{by whom?|date=July 2015}} to the Internet Engineering Task Force, but never formalized<ref>{{cite IETF\n| title = DHCP Failover Protocol\n| draft = draft-ietf-dhc-failover-12\n| last1 = Droms | first1 = Ralph\n| last2 = Kinnear | first2 = Kim\n| last3 = Stapp | first3 = Mark\n| last4 = Volz | first4 = Bernie\n| last5 = Gonczi | first5 = Steve\n| last6 = Rabil | first6 = Greg\n| last7 = Dooley | first7 = Michael\n| last8 = Kapur | first8 = Arun\n| date = March 2003\n| publisher = [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]\n| accessdate = May 09, 2010\n}}</ref>{{Efn|The proposal provided a mechanism whereby two servers could remain loosely in sync with each other in such a way that even in the event of a total failure of one server, the other server could recover the lease database and continue operating. Due to the length and complexity of the specification, it was never published as a standard; however, the techniques described in the specification are in wide use, with one open-source implementation in the [[ISC DHCP]] server, as well as several commercial implementations.}}\n\nIf rebinding fails, the lease will eventually expire.   When the lease expires, the client must stop using the IP address granted to it in its lease.<ref name=rfc2131/>{{rp|Section 4.4.5 Paragraph 9}}   At that time it will restart the DHCP process from the beginning by broadcasting a DHCPDISCOVER message.   Since its lease has expired, it will accept any IP address offered to it.   Once it has a new IP address (presumably from a different DHCP server) it will once again be able to use the network.   However, since its IP address has changed, any ongoing connections will be broken.\n\n==Security==\n{{see also|DHCP snooping}}\nThe base DHCP does not include any mechanism for authentication.<ref name=\"RAIOSec\">{{cite web |url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3046#section-7 |title = RFC 3046 - DHCP Relay Agent Information Option |author = Michael Patrick |date = January 2001 |work = Network Working Group }}</ref>  Because of this, it is vulnerable to a variety of attacks.
