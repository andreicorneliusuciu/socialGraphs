Some particles are [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolved]] in a glass of water. At first, the particles are all near one corner of the glass. If the particles all randomly move around (\"diffuse\") in the water, they eventually become distributed randomly and uniformly, and organized (diffusion continues, but with no net [[flux]]).]]\n[[File:Diffusion v2 20101120.ogv|thumb|Time lapse video of diffusion of a dye dissolved in water into a gel.]]\n\n[[File:DiffusionMicroMacro.gif|thumb|250px|Diffusion from a microscopic and macroscopic point of view.

This is also referred to as the movement of a substance down a [[concentration gradient]]. A [[gradient]] is the change in the value of a quantity (e.g., concentration, [[pressure]], [[temperature]]) with the change in another variable (usually [[distance]]). For example, a change in concentration over a distance is called a concentration gradient, a change in pressure over a distance is called a [[pressure gradient]], and a change in temperature over a distance is a called a [[temperature gradient]].\n\nThe word '''diffusion''' derives from the [[Latin]] word, ''diffundere'', which means \"to spread out\" (a substance that \u201cspreads out\u201d is moving from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration). A distinguishing feature of diffusion is that it results in mixing or mass transport, without requiring bulk motion (bulk flow).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Yayoi Teramoto Kimura|title=The Mathematics of Patterns:The modeling and analysis of reaction-diffusion equations|date=May 9, 2014|issue=Independent work in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the certificate in the Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics|page=8|url=http://www.pacm.princeton.edu/documents/Kimura.pdf|ref=Princeton University}}</ref> \nThus, diffusion should not be confused with [[convection]], or [[advection]], which are other [[transport phenomena]] that utilize bulk motion to move particles from one place to another.\n\n==Diffusion vs. bulk flow==\nAn example of a situation in which [[bulk flow]] and diffusion can be differentiated is the mechanism by which [[oxygen]] enters the body during [[external respiration]] (breathing). The [[lungs]] are located in the [[thoracic cavity]], which expands as the first step in external respiration. This expansion leads to an increase in volume of the [[alveoli]] in the lungs, which causes a decrease in pressure in the alveoli. This creates a pressure gradient between the [[air]] outside the body (relatively high pressure) and the alveoli (relatively low pressure). The air moves down the pressure gradient through the airways of the lungs and into the alveoli until the pressure of the air and that in the alveoli are equal (i.e., the movement of air by bulk flow stops once there is no longer a pressure gradient).\n\nThe air arriving in the alveoli has a higher concentration of oxygen than the \u201cstale\u201d air in the alveoli. The increase in oxygen concentration creates a concentration gradient for oxygen between the air in the alveoli and the blood in the [[capillaries]] that surround the alveoli. Oxygen then moves by diffusion, down the concentration gradient, into the blood. The other consequence of the air arriving in alveoli is that the concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] in the alveoli decreases (air has a very low concentration of carbon dioxide compared to the [[blood]] in the body). This creates a concentration gradient for carbon dioxide to diffuse from the blood into the alveoli.\n\nThe pumping action of the [[heart]] then transports the blood around the body. As the left ventricle of the heart contracts, the volume decreases, which increases the pressure in the ventricle. This creates a pressure gradient between the heart and the capillaries, and blood moves through [[blood vessel]]s by bulk flow (down the pressure gradient). As the thoracic cavity contracts during expiration, the volume of the alveoli decreases and creates a pressure gradient between the alveoli and the air outside the body, and air moves by bulk flow down the pressure gradient.\n\n==Diffusion in the context of different disciplines==\n[[File:Centrotherm diffusion furnaces at LAAS 0481.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Diffusion furnaces used for [[thermal oxidation]]]]\nThe concept of diffusion is widely used in: [[physics]] ([[Molecular diffusion|particle diffusion]]), [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], and [[finance]] (diffusion of people, ideas and of price values). However, in each case, the object (e.g., atom, idea, etc.) that is undergoing diffusion is \u201cspreading out\u201d from a point or location at which there is a higher concentration of that object.\n\nThere are two ways to introduce the notion of ''diffusion'': either a [[wikt:phenomenon|phenomenological approach]] starting with [[Fick's laws of diffusion]] and their mathematical consequences, or a physical and atomistic one, by considering the ''[[random walk]] of the diffusing particles''.<ref>J. Philibert (2005). [http://www.rz.uni-leipzig.de/diffusion/pdf/volume2/diff_fund_2(2005)1.pdf One and a half century of diffusion: Fick, Einstein, before and beyond.] Diffusion Fundamentals, 2, 1.1\u20131.10.</ref>\n\nIn the phenomenological approach, ''diffusion is the movement of a substance from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration without bulk motion''. According to Fick's laws, the diffusion [[Flux#Flux as flow rate per unit area|flux]] is proportional to the negative [[gradient]] of concentrations. It goes from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration. Some time later, various generalizations of Fick's laws were developed in the frame of [[thermodynamics]] and [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]].<ref>S.R. De Groot, P. Mazur (1962). ''Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics''. North-Holland, Amsterdam.</ref>\n\nFrom the ''atomistic point of view'', diffusion is considered as a result of the random walk of the diffusing particles. In [[molecular diffusion]], the moving molecules are self-propelled by thermal energy. Random walk of small particles in suspension in a fluid was discovered in 1827 by [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]]. The theory of the [[Brownian motion]] and the atomistic backgrounds of diffusion were developed by [[Albert Einstein]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=A. Einstein |year=1905|url=http://www.zbp.univie.ac.at/dokumente/einstein2.pdf |title=\u00dcber die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der W\u00e4rme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Fl\u00fcssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen|journal=Ann.

For example, oxygen can diffuse through cell membranes and if there is a higher concentration of oxygen outside the cell than inside, oxygen molecules diffuse into the cell. However, because the movement of molecules is random, occasionally oxygen molecules move out of the cell (against the concentration gradient). Because there are more oxygen molecules outside the cell, the [[probability]] that oxygen molecules will enter the cell is higher than the probability that oxygen molecules will leave the cell. Therefore, the \"net\" movement of oxygen molecules (the difference between the number of molecules either entering or leaving the cell) is into the cell. In other words, there is a ''net movement'' of oxygen molecules down the concentration gradient.\n\n==History of diffusion in physics==\nIn the scope of time, diffusion in solids was used long before the theory of diffusion was created. For example, [[Pliny the Elder]] had previously described the [[cementation process]], which produces steel from the element iron (Fe) through carbon diffusion. Another example is well known for many centuries, the diffusion of colours of [[stained glass]] or [[earthenware]] and [[Chinese ceramics]].\n\nIn modern science, the first systematic experimental study of diffusion was performed by [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]]. He studied diffusion in gases, and the main phenomenon was described by him in 1831\u20131833:<ref>''Diffusion Processes'', Thomas Graham Symposium, ed. J.N. Sherwood, A.V. Chadwick, W.M.Muir, F.L. Swinton, Gordon and Breach, London, 1971.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"...gases of different nature, when brought into contact, do not arrange themselves according to their density, the heaviest undermost, and the lighter uppermost, but they spontaneously diffuse, mutually and equally, through each other, and so remain in the intimate state of mixture for any length of time.\u201d </blockquote>\n\nThe measurements of Graham contributed to [[James Clerk Maxwell]] deriving, in 1867, the coefficient of diffusion for CO<sub>2</sub> in air. The error rate is less than 5%.\n\nIn 1855, [[Adolf Fick]], the 26-year-old anatomy demonstrator from Z\u00fcrich, proposed [[Fick's laws of diffusion|his law of diffusion]]. He used Graham's research, stating his goal as \"the development of a fundamental law, for the operation of diffusion in a single element of space\". He asserted a deep analogy between diffusion and conduction of heat or electricity, creating a formalism that is similar to [[Thermal conduction|Fourier's law for heat conduction]] (1822) and [[Ohm's law]] for electric current (1827).\n\n[[Robert Boyle]] demonstrated diffusion in solids in the 17th century<ref>L.W. Barr (1997), In: ''Diffusion in Materials, DIMAT 96'', ed. H.Mehrer, Chr. Herzig, N.A. Stolwijk, H. Bracht, Scitec Publications, Vol.1, pp. 1\u20139.</ref> by penetration of Zinc into a copper coin. Nevertheless, diffusion in solids was not systematically studied until the second part of the 19th century. [[William Chandler Roberts-Austen]], the well-known British metallurgist, and former assistant of Thomas Graham, studied systematically solid state diffusion on the example of gold in lead in 1896. :<ref name=\"Mehrer2009\">{{cite journal|author1=H.

My long connection with Graham's researches made it almost a duty to attempt to extend his work on liquid diffusion to metals.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1858, [[Rudolf Clausius]] introduced the concept of the [[mean free path]]. In the same year, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] developed the first atomistic theory of transport processes in gases. The modern atomistic theory of diffusion and [[Brownian motion]] was developed by [[Albert Einstein]], [[Marian Smoluchowski]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Perrin]]. [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], in the development of the atomistic backgrounds of the macroscopic transport processes, introduced the [[Boltzmann equation]], which has served mathematics and physics with a source of transport process ideas and concerns for more than 140 years.<ref name=\"ChapmanCowling\">S.

He studied self-diffusion of radioactive isotopes of lead in liquid and solid lead.\n\n[[Yakov Frenkel]] (sometimes, Jakov/Jacov Frenkel) proposed, and elaborated in 1926, the idea of diffusion in crystals through local defects (vacancies and interstitial atoms). He concluded, the diffusion process in condensed matter is an ensemble of elementary jumps and quasichemical interactions of particles and defects. He introduced several mechanisms of diffusion and found rate constants from experimental data.\n\nSome time later, [[Carl Wagner]] and [[Walter H. Schottky]] developed Frenkel's ideas about mechanisms of diffusion further. Presently, it is universally recognized that atomic defects are necessary to mediate diffusion in crystals.<ref name=\"Mehrer2009\"/>\n\n[[Henry Eyring (chemist)|Henry Eyring]], with co-authors, applied his theory of [[Transition state theory|absolute reaction rates]] to Frenkel's quasichemical model of diffusion.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=J.F.

A [[molecule]] or [[ion]] with [[kinetic energy]] (explain) collides with other molecules and ions, and each collision alters the kinetic energy and [[momentum]] of both particles. Unless the particles are bound in position in a solid, they are free to move away from each other until the next collision. Therefore, in a fluid all the particles move from collision to collision, changing direction with each collision. The path of any given particle is random, so the probability of it returning to a previous position is lower than of going somewhere else, since there are so many more other places to go. If the fluid is in a container, any collision with the solid container sends it back into the volume of the fluid. The rate at which a given particle moves away from its original position depends on how fast it moves on average, which depends on the temperature, and how often it collides with other particles, which in turn depends on how far apart they are on average. The particles of a gas are much further apart than the particles of a liquid, so a gas molecule or ion generally goes further before colliding and changing direction each time, so it moves away from any given point more quickly, assuming equal velocities.\n\nWhen all particles start out evenly mixed, there is no noticeable difference over time, and they stay evenly mixed. However if there is a region where most of the particles are of one type at a given time, they tend to disperse until evenly distributed.\n-->\n\n== Basic models of diffusion ==\n\n=== Diffusion flux ===\nEach model of diffusion expresses the '''diffusion flux''' through concentrations, densities and their derivatives. Flux is a vector <math>\\mathbf{J}</math>. The transfer of a [[physical quantity]] <math>N</math> through a small [[area]] <math>\\Delta S</math> with normal <math>\\nu</math> per time <math>\\Delta t</math> is\n:<math>\\Delta N = (\\mathbf{J},\\nu) \\Delta S \\Delta t +o(\\Delta S \\Delta t)\\, ,</math>\nwhere <math>(\\mathbf{J},\\nu)</math> is the [[inner product]] and <math>o(...)</math> is the [[little-o notation]].\nIf we use the notation of [[vector area]] <math>\\Delta \\mathbf{S}=\\nu \\Delta S</math> then\n:<math>\\Delta N = (\\mathbf{J}, \\Delta \\mathbf{S}) \\Delta t +o(\\Delta \\mathbf{S} \\Delta t)\\, . </math>\nThe [[Dimensional analysis|dimension]] of the diffusion flux is [flux]=[quantity]/([time]\u00b7[area]).\nThe diffusing physical quantity <math>N</math> may be the number of particles, mass, energy, electric charge, or any other scalar [[extensive quantity]]. For its density, <math>n</math>, the diffusion equation has the form\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t}= - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} +W \\, ,</math>\nwhere <math>W</math> is intensity of any local source of this quantity (the rate of a chemical reaction, for example).\nFor the diffusion equation, the '''no-flux boundary conditions''' can be formulated as <math>(\\mathbf{J}(x),\\nu(x))=0</math> on the boundary, where <math>\\nu</math> is the normal to the boundary at point <math>x</math>.\n\n=== Fick's law and equations ===\n{{Main article|Fick's laws of diffusion}}\n\nFick's first law: the diffusion flux is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient:\n:<math>\\mathbf{J}=-D \\nabla n \\ , \\;\\; J_i=-D \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x_i} \\ .</math>\nThe corresponding diffusion equation (Fick's second law) is\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial n(x,t)}{\\partial t}=\\nabla\\cdot( D \\nabla n(x,t))=D \\Delta n(x,t)\\ , </math>\nwhere <math>\\Delta</math> is the [[Laplace operator]],\n:<math>\\Delta n(x,t) = \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial^2 n(x,t)}{\\partial x_i^2} \\ .</math>\n\n=== Onsager's equations for multicomponent diffusion and thermodiffusion ===\nFick's law describes diffusion of an admixture in a medium. The concentration of this admixture should be small and the gradient of this concentration should be also small.

It should be stressed that the separate diffusion equations describe the mixing or mass transport without bulk motion. Therefore, the terms with variation of the total pressure are neglected. It is possible for diffusion of small admixtures and for small gradients.\n\nFor the linear Onsager equations, we must take the thermodynamic forces in the linear approximation near equilibrium:\n:<math>X_i= \\sum_{k \\geq 0} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 s(n)}{\\partial n_i \\partial n_k}\\right|_{n=n^*} {\\rm grad} n_k \\ ,</math>\nwhere the derivatives of ''s'' are calculated at equilibrium ''n''<sup>*</sup>.\nThe matrix of the ''kinetic coefficients'' <math>L_{ij}</math> should be symmetric ([[Onsager reciprocal relations]]) and [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]] ([[Second law of thermodynamics|for the entropy growth]]).\n\nThe transport equations are\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial n_i}{\\partial t}= - {\\rm div} \\mathbf{J}_i =- \\sum_{j\\geq 0} L_{ij}{\\rm div} X_j = \\sum_{k\\geq 0} \\left[-\\sum_{j\\geq 0} L_{ij} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 s(n)}{\\partial n_j \\partial n_k}\\right|_{n=n^*}\\right] \\Delta n_k\\ .</math>\nHere, all the indexes ''i, j, k''=0,1,2,... are related to the internal energy (0) and various components. The expression in the square brackets is the matrix <math>D_{ik}</math>of the diffusion (''i,k''>0), thermodiffusion (''i''>0, ''k''=0 or ''k''>0, ''i''=0) and [[thermal conductivity]] (''i=k''=0) coefficients.\n\nUnder [[Isothermal process|isothermal conditions]] ''T''=const. The relevant thermodynamic potential is the free energy (or the [[free entropy]]). The thermodynamic driving forces for the isothermal diffusion are antigradients of chemical potentials, <math>-(1/T)\\nabla\\mu_j</math>, and the matrix of diffusion coefficients is\n:<math>D_{ik}=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{j\\geq 1} L_{ij} \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\mu_j(n,T)}{ \\partial n_k}\\right|_{n=n^*}</math>\n(''i,k''>0).\n\nThere is intrinsic arbitrariness in the definition of the thermodynamic forces and kinetic coefficients because they are not measurable separately and only their combinations <math>\\sum_j L_{ij}X_j</math> can be measured. For example, in the original work of Onsager<ref name = \"Onsager1931\"/> the thermodynamic forces include additional multiplier ''T'', whereas in the [[Course of Theoretical Physics]]<ref>\n{{cite book\n |author=[[Lev Landau|L.D.

All these changes are supplemented by the corresponding changes in the coefficients and do not effect the measurable quantities.\n\n=== Nondiagonal diffusion must be nonlinear ===\nThe formalism of linear irreversible thermodynamics (Onsager) generates the systems of linear diffusion equations in the form\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t} =\\sum_j D_{ij} \\Delta c_j \\, .</math>\nIf the matrix of diffusion coefficients is diagonal then this system of equations is just a collection of decoupled Fick's equations for various components.

At this state, <math>\\partial c_2/ \\partial t = D_{12} \\Delta c_1</math>. If <math>D_{12} \\Delta c_1(x) < 0</math> at some points then <math>c_2(x)</math> becomes negative at these points in a short time.

Their surface concentrations are <math>c_1,c_2,\\ldots c_m</math>. The surface is a lattice of the adsorption places. Each\nreagent molecule fills a place on the surface. Some of the places are free. The concentration of the free paces is <math>z=c_0</math>. The sum of all <math>c_i</math> (including free places) is constant, the density of adsorption places ''b''.\n\nThe jump model gives for the diffusion flux of <math>A_i</math> (''i''=1,...,''n''):\n:<math>\\mathbf{J}_i=-D_i[z \\nabla c_i - c_i \\nabla z]\\, . </math>\nThe corresponding diffusion equation is:<ref name=GorbanMMNP2011/>\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t}=- \\mathrm{div}\\mathbf{J}_i=D_i[z \\Delta c_i - c_i \\Delta z] \\, .</math>\nDue to the conservation law, <math>z=b-\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i \\, ,</math> and we\nhave the system of ''m'' diffusion equations. For one component we get Fick's law and linear equations because <math>(b-c) \\nabla c- c\\nabla(b-c)=b\\nabla c</math>. For two and more components the equations are nonlinear.\n\nIf all particles can exchange their positions with their closest neighbours then a simple generalization gives\n:<math>\\mathbf{J}_i=-\\sum_j D_{ij}[c_j \\nabla c_i - c_i \\nabla c_j]</math>\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t}=\\sum_j D_{ij}[c_j \\Delta c_i - c_i \\Delta c_j]</math>\nwhere <math>D_{ij} = D_{ji} \\geq 0</math> is a symmetric matrix of coefficients that characterize the intensities of jumps. The free places (vacancies) should be considered as special \"particles\" with concentration <math>c_0</math>.\n\nVarious versions of these jump models are also suitable for simple diffusion mechanisms in solids.\n\n=== Diffusion in porous media ===\nFor diffusion in porous media the basic equations are:<ref>J. L. V\u00e1zquez (2006), The Porous Medium Equation. Mathematical Theory, Oxford Univ. Press, ISBN 0198569033.</ref>\n:<math>\\mathbf{J}=- D \\nabla n^m</math>\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t}=D \\Delta n^m \\, ,</math>\nwhere ''D'' is the diffusion coefficient, ''n'' is the concentration, ''m''>0 (usually m>1, the case ''m''=1 corresponds to Fick's law).\n\nFor diffusion of gases in porous media this equation is the formalisation of [[Darcy's law]]: the velocity of a gas in the porous media is\n:<math>v=-\\frac{k}{\\mu}\\nabla p</math>\nwhere ''k'' is the [[Permeation|permeability]] of the medium, ''\u03bc'' is the [[viscosity]] and ''p'' is the pressure. The flux ''J=nv'' and for <math>p \\sim n^{\\gamma}</math> Darcy's law gives the equation of diffusion in porous media with ''m=\u03b3+1''.\n\nFor underground water infiltration the [[Boussinesq approximation (buoyancy)|Boussinesq approximation]] gives the same equation with ''m''=2.\n\nFor plasma with the high level of radiation the [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich|Zeldovich]]-Raizer equation gives ''m>4'' for the heat transfer.\n\n<!--As we know that in porous media there are pores as well as solid material existing to gather all the way along the spacial dimensions of the porous media. So, there exist a combination of diffusion mechanisms in poroous media. To understand this, lets consider the example of ceramic membranes. when a gas enters into a ceramic membrane it undergoes the molecular diffusion when moving through the material of the porous media and knudsen diffusion ( if the diameter of pore is less than the length of the pore) and molecular difussion ( can be self diffusion or mutual diffusion depending on the number of species being diffused) in series when moving in the pores. while moving in the pore the poiseuille diffusion also happens in parrllel with knudsen and molecular diffusion. Depending on the nature of material and operating conditions one or more types of diffusion may not be aplicable be small and can be neglected but basic phenomenon is the same. for more information see <M.

In this case, the elementary mean free path theory of diffusion gives for the diffusion coefficient\n\n:<math>D=\\frac{1}{3} \\ell v_T = \\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\rm B}^3}{\\pi^3 m}}\\frac{T^{3/2}}{Pd^2}\\, ,</math>\nwhere ''k''<sub>B</sub> is the [[Boltzmann constant]], ''T'' is the [[temperature]], ''P'' is the [[pressure]], <math>\\ell</math> is the [[mean free path]], and ''v<sub>T</sub>'' is the mean thermal speed:\n:<math>\\ell = \\frac{k_{\\rm B}T}{\\sqrt 2 \\pi d^2 P}\\, , \\;\\;\\; v_T=\\sqrt{\\frac{8k_{\\rm B}T}{\\pi m}}\\, .</math>\nWe can see that the diffusion coefficient in the mean free path approximation grows with ''T'' as ''T''<sup>3/2</sup> and decreases with ''P'' as 1/''P''. If we use for ''P'' the [[ideal gas law]] ''P=RnT'' with the total concentration ''n'', then we can see that for given concentration ''n'' the diffusion coefficient grows with ''T'' as ''T''<sup>1/2</sup> and for given temperature it decreases with the total concentration as ''1/n''.\n\nFor two different gases, A and B, with molecular masses ''m''<sub>A</sub>, ''m''<sub>B</sub> and molecular diameters ''d''<sub>A</sub>, ''d''<sub>B</sub>, the mean free path estimate of the diffusion coefficient of A in B and B in A is:\n:<math>D_{\\rm AB}=\\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\rm B}^3}{\\pi^3}}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2m_{\\rm A}}+\\frac{1}{2m_{\\rm B}}}\\frac{4T^{3/2}}{P(d_{\\rm A}+d_{\\rm B})^2}\\, ,</math>\n\n=== The theory of diffusion in gases based on Boltzmann's equation ===\nIn Boltzmann's kinetics of the mixture of gases, each gas has its own distribution function, <math>f_i(x,c,t)</math>, where ''t'' is the time moment, ''x'' is position and ''c'' is velocity of molecule of the ''i''th component of the mixture. Each component has its mean velocity <math>C_i(x,t)=\\frac{1}{n_i}\\int_c c f(x,c,t) \\, dc</math>. If the velocities <math>C_i(x,t)</math> do not coincide then there exists ''diffusion''.\n\nIn the [[Chapman\u2013Enskog theory|Chapman-Enskog]] approximation, all the distribution functions are expressed through the densities of the conserved quantities:<ref name=\"ChapmanCowling\"/>\n*individual concentrations of particles, <math>n_i(x,t)=\\int_c f_i(x,c,t)\\, dc</math> (particles per volume),\n*density of moment <math>\\sum_i m_i n_i C_i(x,t)</math> (''m<sub>i</sub>'' is the ''i''th particle mass),\n*density of kinetic energy <math>\\sum_i \\left( n_i\\frac{m_i C^2_i(x,t)}{2} + \\int_c \\frac{m_i (c_i-C_i(x,t))^2}{2} f_i(x,c,t)\\, dc \\right)</math>.\nThe kinetic temperature ''T'' and pressure ''P'' are defined in 3D space as\n:<math>\\frac{3}{2}k_{\\rm B}T=\\frac{1}{n} \\int_c \\frac{m_i (c_i-C_i(x,t))^2}{2} f_i(x,c,t)\\, dc</math>; <math>P=k_{\\rm B}nT</math>,\nwhere <math>n=\\sum_i n_i</math> is the total density.\n\nFor two gases, the difference between velocities, <math>C_1-C_2</math> is given by the expression:<ref name=\"ChapmanCowling\"/>\n:<math>C_1-C_2=-\\frac{n^2}{n_1n_2}D_{12}\\left\\{ \\nabla \\left(\\frac{n_1}{n}\\right)+ \\frac{n_1n_2 (m_2-m_1)}{n (m_1n_1+m_2n_2)}\\nabla P- \\frac{m_1n_1m_2n_2}{P(m_1n_1+m_2n_2)}(F_1-F_2)+k_T \\frac{1}{T}\\nabla T\\right\\}</math>,\nwhere <math>F_{i}</math> is the force applied to the molecules of the ''i''th component and <math>k_T</math> is the thermodiffusion ratio.\n\nThe coefficient ''D''<sub>12</sub> is positive. This is the diffusion coefficient. Four terms in the formula for ''C''<sub>1</sub>-''C''<sub>2</sub> describe four main effects in the diffusion of gases:\n#<math>\\nabla \\left(\\frac{n_1}{n}\\right)</math> describes the flux of the first component from the areas with the high ratio ''n''<sub>1</sub>/''n'' to the areas with lower values of this ratio (and, analogously the flux of the second component from high ''n''<sub>2</sub>/''n'' to low ''n''<sub>2</sub>/''n'' because ''n''<sub>2</sub>/''n''=1-''n''<sub>1</sub>/''n'');\n#<math>\\frac{n_1n_2 (m_2-m_1)}{n (m_1n_1+m_2n_2)}\\nabla P</math> describes the flux of the heavier molecules to the areas with higher pressure and the lighter molecules to the areas with lower pressure, this is [[barodiffusion]];\n#<math>\\frac{m_1n_1m_2n_2}{P(m_1n_1+m_2n_2)}(F_1-F_2)</math> describes diffusion caused by the difference of the forces applied to molecules of different types. For example, in the Earth's gravitational field, the heavier molecules should go down, or in electric field the charged molecules should move, until this effect is not equilibrated by the sum of other terms. This effect should not be confused with barodiffusion caused by the pressure gradient.\n#<math>k_T \\frac{1}{T}\\nabla T</math> describes [[thermodiffusion]], the diffusion flux caused by the temperature gradient.\n\nAll these effects are called ''diffusion'' because they describe the differences between velocities of different components in the mixture. Therefore, these effects cannot be described as a ''bulk'' transport and differ from advection or convection.\n\nIn the first approximation,<ref name=\"ChapmanCowling\"/>\n*<math>D_{12}=\\frac{3}{2n(d_1+d_2)^2}\\left[\\frac{kT(m_1+m_2)}{2\\pi m_1m_2}\\right]^{1/2}</math> for rigid spheres;\n*<math>D_{12}=\\frac{3}{8nA_1({\\nu})\\Gamma(3-\\frac{2}{\\nu-1})}\\left[\\frac{kT(m_1+m_2)}{2\\pi m_1m_2}\\right]^{1/2} \\left(\\frac{2kT}{\\kappa_{12}}\\right)^{\\frac{2}{\\nu-1}}</math> for repulsing force <math>\\kappa_{12}r^{-\\nu}</math>.\nThe number <math>A_1({\\nu})</math> is defined by quadratures (formulas (3.7), (3.9), Ch. 10 of the classical Chapman and Cowling book<ref name=\"ChapmanCowling\"/>)\n\nWe can see that the dependence on ''T'' for the rigid spheres is the same as for the simple mean free path theory but for the power repulsion laws the exponent is different. Dependence on a total concentration ''n'' for a given temperature has always the same character, 1/''n''.\n\nIn applications to gas dynamics, the diffusion flux and the bulk flow should be joined in one system of transport equations. The bulk flow describes the mass transfer. Its velocity ''V'' is the mass average velocity. It is defined through the momentum density and the mass concentrations:\n:<math>V=\\frac{\\sum_i \\rho_i C_i}{\\rho}\\, .</math>\nwhere <math>\\rho_i =m_i n_i</math> is the mass concentration of the ''i''th species, <math>\\rho=\\sum_i \\rho_i</math> is the mass density.\n\nBy definition, the diffusion velocity of the ''i''th component is <math>v_i=C_i-V</math>, <math>\\sum_i \\rho_i v_i=0</math>.\nThe mass transfer of the ''i''th component is described by the [[continuity equation]]\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\rho_i}{\\partial t}+\\nabla(\\rho_i V) + \\nabla (\\rho_i v_i)=W_i \\, ,</math>\nwhere <math>W_i</math> is the net mass production rate in chemical reactions, <math>\\sum_i W_i= 0</math>.\n\nIn these equations, the term <math>\\nabla(\\rho_i V)</math> describes advection of the ''i''th component and the term <math>\\nabla (\\rho_i v_i)</math> represents diffusion of this component.\n\nIn 1948, [[Wendell H. Furry]] proposed to use the ''form'' of the diffusion rates found in kinetic theory as a framework for the new phenomenological approach to diffusion in gases. This approach was developed further by F.A. Williams and S.H. Lam.<ref>{{cite journal|author=S. H.

Electrons have higher diffusion constant than holes leading to fewer excess electrons at the center as compared to holes.]]\n\n=== Diffusion of electrons in solids ===\n\n{{main article|Diffusion_current}}\nWhen the density of electrons in solids is not in equilibrium, diffusion of electrons occurs. For example, when a bias is applied to two ends of a chunk of semiconductor, or a light shines on one end (see right figure), electron diffuse from high density regions (center) to low density regions (two ends), forming a gradient of electron density. This process generates current, referred to as [[diffusion current]].\n \nDiffusion current can also be described by [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick's first law]]\n:<math>J=- D {\\partial n}/{\\partial x}\\, ,</math>\nwhere ''J'' is the diffusion current density ([[amount of substance]]) per unit area per unit time, ''n'' (for ideal mixtures) is the electron density, ''x'' is the position [length].\n\n==Random walk (random motion)==\n[[File:Random motion.webm|thumb|The apparent random motion of atoms, ions or molecules explained. Substances appear to move randomly due to collisions with other substances. From the iBook \"Cell Membrane Transport\", free license granted by IS3D, LLC, 2014.]] One common misconception is that individual atoms, ions or molecules move randomly, which they do not. In the animation on the right, the ion on in the left panel has a \u201crandom\u201d motion, but this motion is not random as it is the result of \u201ccollisions\u201d with other ions. As such, the movement of a single atom, ion, or molecule within a mixture just appears random when viewed in isolation. The movement of a substance within a mixture by \u201crandom walk\u201d is governed by the kinetic energy within the system that can be affected by changes in concentration, pressure or temperature.\n\n=== Separation of diffusion from convection in gases ===\nWhile Brownian motion of multi-molecular mesoscopic particles (like pollen grains studied by Brown) is observable under an optical microscope, molecular diffusion can only be probed in carefully controlled experimental conditions. Since Graham experiments, it is well known that avoiding of convection is necessary and this may be a non-trivial task.\n\nUnder normal conditions, molecular diffusion dominates only on length scales between nanometer and millimeter. On larger length scales, transport in liquids and gases is normally due to another [[transport phenomena|transport phenomenon]], [[convection]], and to study diffusion on the larger scale, special efforts are needed.\n\nTherefore, some often cited examples of diffusion are ''wrong'': If cologne is sprayed in one place, it can soon be smelled in the entire room, but a simple calculation shows that this can't be due to diffusion. Convective motion persists in the room because the temperature [inhomogeneity]. If ink is dropped in water, one usually observes an inhomogeneous evolution of the spatial distribution, which clearly indicates convection (caused, in particular, by this dropping).{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nIn contrast, [[heat conduction]] through solid media is an everyday occurrence (e.g. a metal spoon partly immersed in a hot liquid).
