These devices are off at zero gate\u2013source voltage, and can be turned on by\npulling the gate voltage either higher than the source voltage, for NMOS, or lower than the source voltage, for PMOS.  In most circuits, this means pulling an enhancement-mode MOSFET's gate voltage towards its drain voltage turns it ''ON''.\n\nIn a depletion-mode MOSFET, the device is normally ''ON'' at zero gate\u2013source voltage.  Such devices are used as load \"resistors\" in logic circuits (in [[depletion-load NMOS logic]], for example).  For [[N-type semiconductor|N-type]] depletion-load devices, the threshold voltage might be about \u20133 V, so it could be turned off by pulling the gate 3 V negative (the [[drain (transistor)|drain]], by comparison, is more positive than the source in NMOS).  In PMOS, the polarities are reversed.\n\nThe mode can be determined by the sign of the [[threshold voltage]] (gate voltage relative to source voltage at the point where an inversion layer just forms in the channel):  for an N-type FET, enhancement-mode devices have positive thresholds, and depletion-mode devices have negative thresholds; for a P-type FET, enhancement-mode negative, depletion-mode positive.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = Digital systems engineering\n | author = William J.

Logic families built in older processes that did not support depletion-mode transistors were retrospectively referred to as ''enhancement-load'' logic, or as ''saturated-load'' logic, since the enhancement-mode transistors were typically connected with gate to the V<sub>DD</sub> supply and operated in the saturation region (sometimes the gates are biased to a higher V<sub>GG</sub> voltage and operated in the linear region, for a better [[power\u2013delay product]], but the loads then take more area).<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = Microelectronics\n | edition = 2nd\n | author = Jerry C.
