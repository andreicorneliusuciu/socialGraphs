Bites, which can introduce [[saliva]] as well as additional pathogens and diseases, are often confused with stings.  Specific components of venom are believed to give rise to an [[Allergy|allergic reaction]], which in turn produces skin lesions that may vary from a small itching wheal, or slightly elevated area of the skin; to large areas of inflamed skin covered by [[Vesicle (dermatology)|vesicles]] and crusted [[lesions]].\n\nStinging insects produce a painful swelling of the skin, the severity of the lesion varying according to the location of the sting, the identity of the insect and the sensitivity of the subject. Many species of [[bee]]s and [[wasp]]s have two poison glands, one gland secreting a [[toxin]] in which [[formic acid]] is one recognized constituent, and the other secreting an [[alkaline]] [[neurotoxin]]; acting independently, each toxin is rather mild, but when they combine through the sting, the combination has strong irritating properties. In a small number of cases the second occasion of a bee or wasp sting causes a severe allergic reaction known as [[anaphylaxis]].\n\nHornets, some [[ant]]s, [[centipede]]s, and [[scorpion]]s also sting.\n\nA few insects leave their stinger in the wound, but this is overstated.  For example, of the 10,000 species of bees worldwide, only the half-dozen species of Honey bees, ([[Apis]]) are reported to have a barbed stinger that cannot be withdrawn; of wasps, all are reported to have smooth stingers.  Multiple stings may give rise to severe systemic symptoms, which may lead to death; this most frequently occurs with a few social bees and wasps.\n\n==Terminology==\nTechnically, a ''stinger'' is the part of an insect or animal that holds a ''sting'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Oxford Dictionaries|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/stinger|website=oxforddictionaries.com|accessdate=21 January 2015}}</ref> where a ''sting'' is the pointed organ. In common American usage, ''stinger'' is a colloquialism for ''sting.'' A ''sting'' differs from other piercing structures in that it pierces by its own action and injects venom, as opposed to [[teeth]], which pierce by the force of opposing [[jaw]]s. Stinging hairs that actively inject venom on plants such as [[Urtica dioica|stinging nettles]] are also sometimes known as ''stings'', but not ''stingers''.<ref>Oxford English dictionary, 2nd ed., ''sting'' n<sup>2</sup>, 3</ref>\n\n==Arthropods==\n[[File:Vespula vulgaris SEM Sting 01.jpg|right|thumb|[[Yellowjacket]] sting in its sheath in the [[scanning electron microscope]].]]\nAmong arthropods, a sting is a sharp organ, often connected with a venom gland and adapted to inflict a wound by piercing, as with the caudal sting of a [[scorpion]]. Stings are usually located at the rear of the animal. Animals with stings include bees, wasps (including [[hornet]]s), [[scorpion]]s<ref name=\"A\">{{cite book |author1=Thomas Eisner |author2=Maria Eisner |author3=Melody Siegler |year=2005 |title=Secret Weapons: Defences of Insects, Spiders, Scorpions, and other Many-legged Creatures |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=978-0-674-01882-2}}</ref> and some groups of [[ant]]s.\n\n[[File:ScorpionBarb.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scorpion]]'s stinger.]]\nUnlike most other stings, [[honey bee]] workers' stings (a modified [[ovipositor]] as in other stinging [[Hymenoptera]]) are strongly barbed and lodge in the flesh of [[mammal]]s upon use, tearing free from the honey bee's body, killing the bee within minutes.<ref name=\"A\"/> The sting has its own [[ganglion]], and it continues to saw into the target's flesh and release venom for several minutes. This trait is of obvious disadvantage to the individual but protects the hive from attacks by large animals.  The barbs ensure that a honey bee's attack is only suicidal if the attacker is a relatively large animal; bees can sting other insects repeatedly without dying. The sting of nearly all other bees and other sting-bearing organisms is not barbed and can be used to sting repeatedly.\n\nThe barbs on the stings of [[yellowjacket]] wasps and the [[Mexican honey wasp]] are so small that they do not cause the sting apparatus to pull free.\n\nThe stings of some wasps, such as those of the ''[[Polistes versicolor]]'', contain relatively large amounts of [[5-hydroxytryptamine]] (5-HT) in its venoms. The 5-HT in these venoms has been found to play at least two roles: one as a pain-producing agent and the other in the distribution and penetration of the paralyzing components to vulnerable sites in the offender. This helps in the rapid immobilization of the animal or of the body parts receiving the venom.<ref>Welsh, John H., and Carolyn S. Batty. \"5-Hydroxytryptamine Content of Some Arthropod Venoms and Venom-containing Parts.\" Toxic on 1.4 (1963): 165-70. Web.</ref>\n\nSpiders also only bite, although some tarantulas have urticating hairs.  Certain caterpillars also have urticating hairs.\n\n==Other animals==\nOrgans that perform similar functions in non-arthropods are often referred to as \"stings.\" These organs include the modified [[dermal denticle]] of the [[stingray]], the [[Platypus venom|venomous spurs]] on the hind legs of the male [[platypus]], and the [[cnidocyte]] [[tentacle]]s of the [[jellyfish]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/sting#sting__4|title=sting: definition of sting in Oxford dictionary (American English) (US)|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''sting'' was historically often used for the [[fang]] of a [[snake]],<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed. \"Sting ... Applied also to the fang or venom-tooth (and erroneously to the forked tongue) of a poisonous serpent.\"</ref> although this usage is uncommon today. Snakes are said, correctly, to [[snake-bite|bite]], not sting.\n\n==Plants==\n[[File:Urtica dioica stinging hair.jpg|thumb|Modified [[trichome]]s function as [[urticating hairs]] in the [[stinging nettle]], ''Urtica dioica''.]]\n{{Expand section|date=January 2015}}\nIn plants, the term \"sting\" is normally used as a verb, but occasionally used as a noun refer to [[urticating hair]]s, sharp-pointed hollow hairs seated on a gland which secretes an acrid fluid, as in species of ''[[Urtica]]'' (nettles). The points of these hairs are brittle and break off easily, leaving a sharp point through which the fluid is injected.<ref>{{cite book |author=Nicholas Stephens |year=2006 |title=Plant Cells and Tissues |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-7910-8560-8 |page=102 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-xY8YOGV1vQC&pg=PA102}}</ref> On the other hand, the bristles of some cacti are recovered by retrorse barbs called [[glochid]]s (like [[Foxtail (diaspore)|foxtail]] spikelets), which prevent bristles from falling once they sting.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Arthropods}}\n* [[Bee sting]]\n* [[Cnidocyte]]\n* [[Chelicerae]]\n* [[Forcipules]]\n* [[Insect bite]]\n* [[Schmidt Sting Pain Index]]\n* [[Starr sting pain scale]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons category-inline|Stingers}}\n\n[[Category:Animal anatomy]]"}]}}}}
