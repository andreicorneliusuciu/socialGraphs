It would heat one side of an object enough to change its orbit and make it hit the atmosphere sooner.\n\n==Technical description==\n\nLasers are designed to target debris between one and ten centimeters in diameter.  Collisions with such debris are commonly of such high velocity that considerable damage and numerous secondary fragments are the result.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astronomycafe.net/qadir/q1697.html |title=Where can I get information about orbiting space junk? |publisher=Astronomy Cafe |work=Ask the Astronomer - Archive of Astronomy Questions and Answers |author=Dr Sten Odenwald |date=1997 |accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref> The laser broom is intended to be used at high enough power to penetrate through the atmosphere with enough remaining power to [[laser ablation|ablate]] material from the target.<ref>Jonathan Campbell, [http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cst/csat20.pdf \"Using Lasers in Space: Laser Orbital Debris Removal and Asteroid Deflection\"], Occasional Paper No. 20, Air University, Maxwell Air Force Base, December 2000.</ref> The ablating material imparts a small [[thrust]] that lowers its [[Geocentric orbit|orbital]] [[perigee]] into the upper atmosphere, thereby increasing [[Drag (physics)|drag]] so that its remaining orbital life is short.<ref>Ivan Bekey, \"[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997ESASP.393..699B Project Orion: Orbital Debris Removal Using Ground-Based Sensors and Lasers].\", ''Second European Conference on Space Debris'', 1997, ESA-SP 393, p. 699.</ref> The laser would operate in pulsed mode to avoid self-shielding of the target by the ablated plasma.  The power levels of lasers in this concept are well below the power levels in concepts for more rapidly effective anti-satellite weapons.\n\n[[NASA]] research in 2011 indicated that firing a laser beam at a piece of space junk could alter velocity by {{convert|0.04|in}} per second.  Persisting with these small velocity changes for a few hours per day could alter its course by {{convert|650|ft}} per day.  While not causing the junk to reenter, this could maneuver it to avoid a collision.<ref name=UKmail20110316>\n{{cite news |last=Bates|first=Daniel |title=Nasa to shoot lasers at space junk around Earth to prevent collisions with satellites |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1366838/Nasa-use-lasers-shoot-space-junk-Earth.html |accessdate=2011-03-24 |newspaper=Mail Online |date=2011-03-16 |quote=''The theory is that the photons in laser beams carry a tiny amount of momentum in them which, under the right circumstances, could nudge an object in space and slow it down by 0.04 inches per second.  By firing a laser at a piece of junk for a few hours it should be possible to alter its course by 650ft per day. ...  While that won\u2019t be enough to knock it out of orbit, it could be sufficient to avoid a collision with a space station or satellite.  The theory marks a change in approach from previous research which looked into using expensive military Star Wars-style lasers to destroy space junk.''}}</ref>\n\nOther funded research into this area refutes NASA's claim and demonstrates the precise physics involved, which shows that space debris is re-entered regardless of the direction of laser illumination.  Using a laser guide star and adaptive optics, a sufficiently large ground based laser (1 megajoule pulsed HF laser) can deorbit dozens of objects per day at reasonable cost.<ref>{{cite arXiv |arxiv=1110.3835|title=Removing Orbital Debris with Lasers |author=Dr Claude Phipps|date=2011 }}</ref>  This work was summarized in an article in Wired Magazine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/2011/10/space-junk-laser/ |title=Space Junk Crisis: Time to Bring in the Lasers |publisher=Wired |work=Space Junk Crisis: Time to Bring in the Lasers |author=Adam Mann|date=2011 |accessdate=2016-06-22}}</ref>\n\n==Applications and proposed project==\n\nThe [[Space Shuttle]] routinely showed evidence of \"tiny\" impacts upon post-flight inspection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/planetearth/space_junk_000901.html |title=Orbiting Junk Continues to Threaten International Space Station |date=5 September 2000 |first=Maia |last=Weinstock |publisher=Space.com |accessdate=2008-02-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001121234600/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/planetearth/space_junk_000901.html |archivedate=2000-11-21}}</ref>\n\nProject Orion was a proposed laser broom project estimated to cost $500 million in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spacefuture.com/archive/orions_laser_hunting_space_debris.shtml |title=Orion's Laser: Hunting Space Debris|publisher=AIAA |work=Aerospace America |author=Ivan Bekey |date=May 1997 |accessdate=2011-05-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.airspacemag.com/space-exploration/space_debris.html?c=y&page=2 | title=Satellite Smashers | publisher=Air & Space Magazine | date=March 1, 2008 | accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''2000 Earth Orbital Debris - NASA Research on Satellite and Spacecraft Effects'' by World Spaceflight News, CD-ROM: 862 pages ISBN 1-893472-28-0\n\n==External links==\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/884256.stm BBC News report on Laser broom]\n* [http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s164735.htm Space Station gets high tech broom] ABC\n* [http://www.spacedaily.com/news/debris-00a.html NASA Hopes Laser Broom Will Help Clean Up Space Debris] [[Agence France-Presse]] story via SpaceDaily\n* [http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/planetearth/space_junk_000901.html Orbiting Junk Continues to Threaten International Space Station] Space.com\n* [http://www.newscientist.com/channel/space/space-shuttle/mg16722521.200 Shuttle to test space junk broom] New Scientist\n* [http://www.seds.org/spaceviews/9707/articles.html SpaceViews July 1997: Articles] [http://www.seds.org/spaceviews/9707/articles.html#1 ORION: A Solution to the Orbital Debris Problem] by Claude Phipps\n* [http://www.wired.com/2011/10/space-junk-laser/ Wired October 2011: Space Junk Crisis: Time to Bring in the Lasers] story on Wired\n* [http://photonicassociates.com/documents/LODR.pdf Removing Orbital Debris with Pulsed Lasers]\n\n[[Category:Force lasers|Broom, laser]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft propulsion]]"}]}}}}
