These filters can also be created by combining a [[low-pass filter]] with a [[high-pass filter]].<ref>{{cite book | title = Time Sequence Analysis in Geophysics | author = E. R.

Hence, one might say \"A dual bandpass filter has two passbands.\"  A ''bandpass signal'' is a signal containing a band of frequencies not adjacent to zero frequency, such as a signal that comes out of a bandpass filter.<ref>{{cite book |title=Introduction to digital signal processing and filter design |author=Belle A.

Additionally, the transition out of the passband would have [[brickwall filter|brickwall]] characteristics.\n\nIn practice, no bandpass filter is ideal. The filter does not attenuate all frequencies outside the desired frequency range completely; in particular, there is a region just outside the intended passband where frequencies are attenuated, but not rejected. This is known as the filter [[roll-off]], and it is usually expressed in [[decibel|dB]] of attenuation per [[Octave (electronics)|octave]] or [[Decade (log scale)|decade]] of frequency. Generally, the design of a filter seeks to make the roll-off as narrow as possible, thus allowing the filter to perform as close as possible to its intended design. Often, this is achieved at the expense of pass-band or stop-band ''ripple''.\n\nThe [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the filter is simply the difference between the upper and lower [[cutoff frequency|cutoff frequencies]]. The shape factor is the ratio of bandwidths measured using two different attenuation values to determine the cutoff frequency, e.g., a shape factor of 2:1 at 30/3 dB means the bandwidth measured between frequencies at 30 dB attenuation is twice that measured between frequencies at 3 dB attenuation.\n\n[[Optical band-pass filter]]s are common in photography and theatre lighting work. These filters take the form of a transparent coloured film or sheet.\n\n== Q factor ==\n\nA band-pass filter can be characterised by its [[Q factor]].  The Q-factor is the inverse of the fractional bandwidth.  A high-Q filter will have a narrow passband and a low-Q filter will have a wide passband.  These are respectively referred to as narrow-band and wide-band filters.\n\n==Applications==\nBandpass filters are widely used in wireless transmitters and receivers. The main function of such a filter in a transmitter is to limit the bandwidth of the output signal to the band allocated for the transmission. This prevents the transmitter from interfering with other stations. In a receiver, a bandpass filter allows signals within a selected range of frequencies to be heard or decoded, while preventing signals at unwanted frequencies from getting through. A bandpass filter also optimizes the signal-to-noise ratio and sensitivity of a receiver.\n\nIn both transmitting and receiving applications, well-designed bandpass filters, having the optimum bandwidth for the mode and speed of communication being used, maximize the number of signal transmitters that can exist in a system, while minimizing the interference or competition among signals.\n\nOutside of electronics and signal processing, one example of the use of band-pass filters is in the [[atmospheric sciences]]. It is common to band-pass filter recent meteorological data with a [[Periodic function|period]] range of, for example, 3 to 10 days, so that only [[cyclone]]s remain as fluctuations in the data fields.\n\nIn [[neuroscience]], [[Visual cortex|visual cortical]] [[simple cell]]s were first shown by [[David Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel]] to have response properties that resemble [[Gabor filter]]s, which are band-pass.<ref>{{cite book | title = Tutorial Essays in Psychology | author = Norman Stuart Sutherland | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates | year = 1979 | isbn = 0-470-26652-X | pages = 68 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yFbf_mulFuUC&pg=PA68&dq=bandpass-filter+Wiesel+Hubel#PPA68,M1 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Atomic line filter]]\n* [[Audio crossover]]\n* [[Band-stop filter]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category inline|Bandpass filters}}\n\n\n{{Electronic filters}}\n\n[[Category:Linear filters]]\n[[Category:Synthesiser modules]]\n[[Category:Filter frequency response]]"}]}}}}
