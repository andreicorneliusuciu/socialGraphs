Some devices (such as [[TRIAC]]s) also have a ''forward breakdown voltage''.\n\n==Solids==\nBreakdown voltage is a characteristic of an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] that defines the maximum [[Breakdown potential|voltage]] difference that can be applied across the material before the insulator collapses and conducts. In solid insulating materials, this usually creates a weakened path within the material by creating permanent molecular or physical changes by the sudden [[electric current|current]].  Within rarefied gases found in certain types of lamps, breakdown voltage is also sometimes called the \"striking voltage\".<ref>J. M. Meek and J. D. Craggs, Electrical Breakdown of Gases,\nJohn Wiley & Sons, Chichester, 1978.</ref>\n\nThe breakdown voltage of a material is not a definite value because it is a form of failure and there is a statistical probability whether the material will fail at a given voltage. When a value is given it is usually the mean breakdown voltage of a large sample. Another term is also [[Dielectric withstand test|withstand voltage]] where the probability of failure at a given voltage is so low it is considered, when designing insulation, that the material will not fail at this voltage.\n\nTwo different breakdown voltage measurements of a material are the AC and impulse breakdown voltages. The AC voltage is the [[utility frequency|line frequency of the mains]].  The impulse breakdown voltage is simulating lightning strikes, and usually uses a 1.2 microsecond rise for the wave to reach 90% amplitude then drops back down to 50% amplitude after 50 microseconds.<ref>Emelyanov, A.A., Izv. Vyssh. Uchebn. Zaved., Fiz., 1989, no. 4, p. 103.</ref>\n\nTwo technical standards governing performing these tests are ASTM D1816 and ASTM D3300 published by ASTM.<ref>Kalyatskii, I.I., Kassirov, G.M., and Smirnov, G.V., Prib.

In partial vacuum, this breakdown potential may decrease to an extent that two uninsulated surfaces with different potentials might induce the electrical breakdown of the surrounding gas.  This may damage an apparatus, as breakdown is analogous to a short circuit.\n\nIn a gas, the breakdown voltage can be determined by [[Paschen's Law]].\n\nThe breakdown voltage in a partial vacuum is represented as<ref>G.

As long as the current is limited, exceeding the breakdown voltage of a diode does no harm to the diode. In fact, [[Zener diode]]s are essentially just [[Doping (semiconductor)|heavily doped]] normal diodes that exploit the breakdown voltage of a diode to provide regulation of voltage levels.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dielectric strength]]\n*[[Electrical breakdown]]\n*[[Avalanche breakdown]]\n*[[Avalanche diode]]\n*[[Paschen's law]] - variation of Breakdown voltage of gas related to pressure\n* [[Electrical treeing]]\n* [[Lichtenberg figure]]\n\n\n[[Category:Electrical breakdown]]\n[[Category:Electrical parameters]]"}]}}}}
