An MTA implements both the client (sending) and server (receiving) portions of the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]].<ref>\nRFC 5598, ''Internet Mail Architecture'', D. Crocker (July 2009).\n</ref>\n\nThe terms ''mail server'', ''mail exchanger'', and ''MX host''  may also refer to a [[computer]] performing the MTA function. The [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) associates a mail server to a domain with an [[MX record]] containing the [[domain name]] of the host(s) providing MTA services.\n\nA mail server is a computer that serves as an electronic post office for [[email]]. Mail exchanged across networks is passed between mail servers that run specially designed software. This software is built around agreed-upon, standardized [[communications protocol | protocol]]s for handling not only mail messages, but also any data files (such as images, multimedia or documents) that might be attached to them.\n\n==Operation==\nA message transfer agent receives mail from either another MTA, a [[mail submission agent]] (MSA), or a [[mail user agent]] (MUA). The transmission details are specified by the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP). When a recipient mailbox of a message is not hosted locally, the message is relayed, that is, forwarded to another MTA. Every time an MTA receives an email message, it adds a <tt>Received</tt> trace header field to the top of the header of the message,<ref>See [[Email#Message header]] for the format of an email message. Many MUAs allow users to see the raw ''message source'' directly, thereby allowing header inspection.</ref> thereby building a sequential record of MTAs handling the message. The process of choosing a target MTA for the next hop is also described in SMTP, but can usually be overridden by configuring the MTA software with specific routes.\n\n[[File:E-mail.svg]]\n\nAn MTA works in the background, while the user usually interacts directly with a mail user agent. One may distinguish initial submission as first passing through an MSA \u2013 port 587 is used for communication between an MUA and an MSA while port 25 is used for communication between MTAs, or from an MSA to an MTA;<ref>See table at [[Email client#Port numbers]]</ref> this distinction is first made in RFC 2476.\n\nFor recipients hosted locally, the final delivery of email to a recipient mailbox is the task of a [[message delivery agent]] (MDA). For this purpose the MTA transfers the message to the message handling service component of the message delivery agent. Upon final delivery, the <tt>Return-Path</tt> field is added to the envelope to record the [[return path]].\n\n==Transfer versus access==\nThe function of an MTA is usually complemented with some means for [[email client]]s to access stored messages. This function typically employs a different protocol. The most widely implemented open protocols for the MUA are the [[Post Office Protocol]] (POP3) and the [[Internet Message Access Protocol]] (IMAP), but many proprietary systems exist for retrieving messages (e.g. [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Exchange]], [[Lotus Notes|Lotus]] Domino/Notes).  Many systems also offer a web interface for reading and sending email that is independent of any particular MUA.\n\nAt its most basic, an MUA using POP3 downloads messages from the server mailbox onto the local computer for display in the MUA.  Messages are generally removed from the server at the same time but most systems also allow a copy to be left behind as a backup. In contrast, an MUA using IMAP displays messages directly from the server, although a download option for archive purposes is usually also available.  One advantage this gives IMAP is that the same messages are visible from any computer accessing the email account, since messages aren't routinely downloaded and deleted from the server.  If set up properly, sent mail can be saved to the server also, in contrast with POP mail, where sent messages exist only in the local MUA and are not visible by other MUAs accessing the same account.\n\nThe IMAP protocol has features that allow uploading of mail messages and there are implementations that can be configured to also ''send'' messages like an MTA,<ref>E.g. [[Courier mail server]] IMAP's ''Outbox'' feature, not fully supported by clients.</ref> which combine sending a copy and storing a copy in the ''Sent'' folder in one upload operation. \n\nThe reason for using SMTP as a standalone transfer protocol is twofold:\n* ''To cope with discontinuous connections.'' Historically, inter-network connections were not continuously available as they are today and many readers didn't need an access protocol, as they could access their [[Email mailbox|mailbox]] directly (as a file) through a terminal connection.  SMTP, if configured to use [[MX record#The backup MX|backup MXes]], can transparently cope with temporary local network outages. A message can be transmitted along a variable path by choosing the next ''hop'' from a preconfigured list of MXes with no intervention from the originating user.\n* ''Submission policies.'' Modern systems are designed for users to submit messages to their local servers for policy, not technical, reasons. It was not always that way. For example, the original [[Eudora (email client)|Eudora]] email client featured direct delivery of mail to the recipients' servers, out of necessity. Today, funneling email through MSA systems run by providers that in principle have some means of holding their users accountable for the generation of the email is a defense against [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] and other forms of email abuse.<ref>{{cite web |author=Bill Cole |title=What are the IPs that sends mail for a domain? |url=http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/asrg/current/msg15593.html |date=29 June 2009 |work=[[Anti-Spam Research Group|ASRG]] mailing list |accessdate=15 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Issues affecting small email-servers==\nIn recent years{{when|date=October 2011}}, mainly due to concerns over spam and a general trend towards centralisation, problems have arisen for small organisations and home users wishing to run their own email server. {{As of | 2011}} many ISPs pre-emptively block outgoing connections to TCP port 25 on domestic connections,<ref>[http://ask.slashdot.org/story/11/02/21/215258/Ask-Slashdot-Is-There-a-War-Against-Small-Mail-Servers Is there a war against small email servers]</ref> and larger email providers have increasingly stringent requirements for other servers that wish to transfer emails to them.
