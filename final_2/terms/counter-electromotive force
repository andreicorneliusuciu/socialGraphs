CEMF is the voltage drop in an alternating current (AC) circuit caused by magnetic induction (see [[Faraday's law of induction]], [[electromagnetic induction]], [[Lenz's Law]]).  For example, the voltage drop across an inductor is due to the induced magnetic field inside the coil.<ref name=\"Graf\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=David Jeffery.|title=Introduction to Electrodynamics|year=2012|edition=3rd}}</ref>  The voltage's [[Polarity (physics)|polarity]] is at every moment the reverse of the input voltage.<ref name=\"Graf\"/><ref>[[Naval Electrical Engineering Training Series]], Module 02 - Introduction to Alternating Current and transformers\", ''Inductance, [http://www.tpub.com/neets/book2/2a.htm self-inductance]''</ref>\n\nThe term '''back electromotive force''', or just back-EMF, is most commonly used to refer to the voltage that occurs in [[electric motor]]s where there is relative motion between the [[armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] of the motor and the [[magnetic field]] from the motor's field magnets, or windings. From Faraday's law, the voltage is proportional to the magnetic field, length of wire in the armature, and the speed of the motor.  This effect is not due to the motor's inductance and is a completely separate effect.\n\nIn a motor using a rotating armature in the presence of a [[magnetic flux]], the conductors cut the magnetic field lines as they rotate. This produces a voltage in the coil; the motor is acting like a generator ([[Faraday's law of induction]].) at the same time it is a motor. This voltage opposes the original applied voltage; therefore, it is called \"''back-electromotive force''\" (by [[Lenz's law]]). With a lower overall voltage across the armature, the current flowing into the motor is reduced.<ref>\"Nuclear Power Fundamentals Training Manuals\".

With an incandescent light on, cause a large motor such as a drill press, saw, air conditioner compressor, or vacuum cleaner to start.  The light may dim briefly as the motor starts.  When the armature is not turning (called locked rotor) there is no Back-EMF and the motor's current draw is quite high.  If the motor's starting current is high enough it will pull the line voltage down enough to notice the dimming of the light.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://progeny.co.uk/back-emf-suppression/''Counter-electromotive-force in access control applications'']\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Counter-Electromotive Force}}\n[[Category:Electromagnetism]]"}]}}}}
