Aerostats include unpowered [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]] and powered [[airship]]s. A balloon may be free-flying or [[Moored balloon|tethered]]. The average density of the craft  is lower than the density of atmospheric air, because its main component is one or more gasbags, a lightweight [[skin]] containing a [[lifting gas]]<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Chambers Dictionary|The Chambers Dictionary]] |page=541 |publisher=Chambers Harrap Publishers Ltd |year=2000 |origyear=1998 |location=Edinburgh |isbn=0-550-14000-X |quote=the gas-bag of a balloon or airship}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Oxford Illustrated Dictionary |page=281 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1976 |origyear=1975 |location=Great Britain |quote=fabric enclosing gas-bags of airship}}</ref> to provide [[buoyancy]], to which other components such as a gondola containing equipment or people are attached. Especially with airships, the gasbags are often protected by an outer envelope. \n\nAerostats are so named because they use [[aerostatic]] lift which is a [[buoyant]] force that does not require movement through the surrounding air mass. This contrasts with the heavy [[Heavier-than-air aircraft|aerodyne]]s that primarily use [[aerodynamic]] [[lift (force)|lift]] which requires the movement of a wing surface through the surrounding air mass. The term has also been used in a narrower sense, to refer to the statically [[tethered balloon]] in contrast to the free-flying airship. This article uses the term in its broader sense.\n\n==Terminology==\n\nIn conventional usage, the term '''aerostat''' refers to any aircraft that remains aloft primarily using aerostatic [[buoyancy]].<ref>Green, W.; ''The observer's world aircraft directory'', Warne (1961)</ref><ref name=\"wragg\">Wragg, D.; ''Historical dictionary of aviation'', History Press (2008).</ref> \n\nHistorically, all aerostats were called balloons. Powered types capable of horizontal flight were referred to as dirigible balloons or simply dirigibles (from the French ''dirigible'' meaning steerable). These powered aerostats later came to be called [[airship]]s, with the term \"[[balloon (aeronautics)|balloon]]\" reserved for unpowered types, whether tethered or free-floating.<ref name=\"wragg\" /><ref>Ege (1973), Page 11.</ref>\n\nMore recently, the US Government Accountability Office has used the term \"aerostat\" in a different sense, to distinguish the statically tethered balloon from the free-flying airship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/650/649661.pdf |title=GAO-13-81, DEFENSE ACQUISITIONS: Future Aerostat and Airship Investment Decisions Drive Oversight and Coordination Needs |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n===Balloons===\n[[File:2006_Ojiya_balloon_festival_011.jpg|thumb|140px|A free-flying [[hot air balloon]]]]\n{{main|Balloon (aeronautics)}}\nA balloon is an aerostat which has no means of propulsion and must be either tethered on a long cable or allowed to drift freely with the wind.\n\nAlthough a free balloon travels at the speed of the wind, it is travelling with the wind so to a passenger the air feels calm and windless. To change its altitude above ground it must either adjust the amount of lift or discard ballast weight. Notable uses of free-flying balloons include [[meteorological balloon]]s and sport balloons.\n\nA [[tethered balloon]] is held down by one or more mooring lines or tethers. It has sufficient lift to hold the line taut and its altitude is controlled by [[winch]]ing the line in or out. A tethered balloon does feel the wind. A round balloon is unstable and bobs about in strong winds, so the [[kite balloon]] was developed with an aerodynamic shape similar to a [[non-rigid airship]]. Both kite balloons and non-rigid airships are sometimes called \"blimps\".<ref name=\"wragg\" /><ref name=\"ege\">Ege (1973)</ref> Notable uses of tethered balloons include [[observation balloon]]s and [[barrage balloon]]s.\n\n===Airships===\n[[File:Goodyear-blimp.jpg|thumb|The Goodyear blimps are non-rigid airships]]\n{{main|Airship}}\nAn airship is a powered, free-flying aerostat that can be steered. Airships divide into [[rigid airship|rigid]], [[Semi-rigid airship|semi-rigid]] and non-rigid types, with these last often known as [[Blimps]].\n\nA rigid airship has an outer framework or skin surrounding the lifting gas bags inside it, The outer envelope keeps its shape even if the gasbags are deflated. The great [[Zeppelin]] airships of the twentieth century were rigid types.\n\nA non-rigid airship or blimp deflates like a balloon as it loses gas. The [[Goodyear blimp]]s are still a common sight in the USA.\n\nA semi-rigid airship has a deflatable gas bag like a non-rigid but with a supporting structure to help it hold its shape while aloft. The first practical airship, the [[Santos-Dumont number 6|Santos-Dumont No.6]] was a semi-rigid.\n\nSome airships obtain additional [[Lift (force)|lift]] aerodynamically as they travel through the air, using the shape of their envelope or through the addition of fins or even small wings. Types designed to exploit this lifting effect in normal cruise are called [[hybrid airship]]s.\n\n===Hybrid aerostats===\n\nA hybrid type uses both static buoyancy and dynamic airflow to provide lift. The dynamic movement may be created either using propulsive power as a [[hybrid airship]] or by tethering in the wind like a kite, as a [[kytoon]].\n\nPiasecki Helicopter developed the [[Piasecki PA-97]] Helistat using the rotor systems from four obsolete helicopters and a surplus Navy blimp, in order to provide a capability to lift heavier loads than a single helicopter could provide. The aircraft suffered a fatal accident during a test flight. In 2008, Boeing and SkyHook International resurrected the concept and announced a proposed design of the [[SkyHook JHL-40]].\n\nThe [[Allsopp Helikite]] is a combination of a helium balloon and a kite to form a single, aerodynamically sound tethered aircraft, that exploits both wind and helium for its lift.\n\n==Lifting gases==\n{{Main|Lifting gas}}\n\nIn order to provide buoyancy, any lifting gas must be lighter, i.e. less [[density|dense]], than the surrounding air. A hot air balloon is open at the bottom to allow hot air to enter, while the gas balloon is closed to stop the (cold) lifting gas from escaping. Common lifting gases have included hydrogen, coal gas and helium.\n\n===Hot air===\nWhen heated, air expands. This lowers its density and creates lift. Small hot air balloons or lanterns have been flown in China since ancient times. The first modern man-lifting aerostat, made by the [[Montgolfier brothers]], was a hot air balloon. Most early balloons however were gas balloons. Interest in the sport of hot air ballooning reawoke in the second half of the twentieth century and even some hot-air airships have been flown.\n\n===Hydrogen===\nHydrogen is the lightest of all gases and a manned hydrogen balloon was flown soon after the Montgolfier brothers. There is no need to burn fuel, so a gas balloon can stay aloft far longer than a hot-air balloon. It is also safer if there is no flame on board, since the materials used to make aerostats are flammable. Hydrogen soon became the most common lifting gas for both balloons and, later, airships. But hydrogen itself is flammable and, following several major disasters in the 1930s, it fell out of use.\n\n===Coal gas===\n[[Coal gas]] comprises a mix of methane and other gases, and typically has about half the lifting power of hydrogen. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries municipal gas works became common and provided a cheap source of lifting gas.<ref>Ege (1973) Pages 110 ff.</ref> Some works were able to produce a special mix for ballooning events, incorporating a higher proportion of hydrogen and less carbon monoxide, to improve its lifting power.\n\n===Helium===\nHelium is the only lifting gas which is both non-flammable and non-toxic, and it has almost as much (about 92%) lifting power as hydrogen. But it was not discovered in quantity until early in the twentieth century, and for many years only the USA had enough to use in airships. Nowadays, almost all gas balloons and airships use helium.\n\n===low pressure gases===\nAlthough not currently practical, it may be possible to construct a rigid, lighter-than-air structure which, rather than being inflated with air, is at a vacuum relative to the surrounding air. This would allow the object to float above the ground without any heat or special lifting gas, but the structural challenges of building a rigid vacuum chamber lighter than air are quite significant. Even so, it may be possible to improve the performance of more conventional aerostats by trading gas weight for structural weight, combining the lifting properties of the gas with vacuum and possibly heat for enhanced lift.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aircraft#Heavier than air \u2013 aerodynes|Aerodyne]]\n*[[Aerostatics]]\n*[[Airborne wind turbine#Aerostat variety]]\n*[[Buoyancy]]\n*[[Cloud Nine (tensegrity sphere)|Cloud nine]]\n*[[Lighter than air]]\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*Ege, Lennart; ''Balloons and Airships'', Blandford, 1973.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.myairship.com/ Airship resources]\n*[http://www.airships.net/ DJ's Zeppelin page]\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=q-MDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA932&dq=popular+mechanics+1930+aircraft&hl=en&ei=DGInTY_oJcP9ngew7cWsAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=popular%20mechanics%201930%20aircraft&f=true \"Illustrations of the Five Major Types of Lighter-Than-Air-Aircraft\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', June 1930\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1E05vwMQj8Q The principle of a balloon flight - VIDEO]\n\n{{Aircraft types (by method of thrust and lift)}}\n\n[[Category:Aerostats| ]]\n[[Category:Balloons (aircraft)]]\n[[Category:Unmanned blimps]]"}]}}}}
