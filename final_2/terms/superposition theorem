The resultant circuit operation is the superposition of the various voltage and current sources.\n\nThe superposition theorem is very important in circuit analysis. It is used in converting any circuit into its [[Norton equivalent]] or [[Thevenin equivalent]].\n\nThe theorem is applicable to linear networks (time varying or time invariant) consisting of independent sources, linear [[dependent source]]s, linear passive elements ([[resistor]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[capacitor]]s) and linear [[transformer]]s.\n\nSuperposition works for voltage and current but not power. In other words, the sum of the powers of each source with the other sources turned off is not the real consumed power. To calculate power we first use superposition to find both current and voltage of each linear element and then calculate the sum of the multiplied voltages and currents.\n\n==Gas pressure analogy==\nThe electric circuit superposition theorem is analogous to [[Dalton's law]] of [[partial pressure]] which can be stated as the total pressure exerted by an [[ideal gas]] mixture in a given volume is the algebraic sum of all the pressures exerted by each gas if it were alone in that volume.\n\n==References==\n* ''Electronic Devices and Circuit Theory'' (9th ed.) by Boylestad and Nashelsky\n* ''Basic Circuit Theory'' by C.
