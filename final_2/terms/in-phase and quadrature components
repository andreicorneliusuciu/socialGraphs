When ''\u03c6''=0,&nbsp; sin(''x''+''\u03c6'') reduces to just the '''in-phase''' component sin(''x'')cos(''\u03c6''),&nbsp; and the '''quadrature''' component sin(''x''+''\u03c0''/2)sin(''\u03c6'') is zero.\n\nWe now note that many authors prefer the identity cos(''x''+''\u03c6'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;cos(''x'')cos(''\u03c6'')&nbsp;+&nbsp;cos(''x''+''\u03c0''/2)sin(''\u03c6''),&nbsp; in which case cos(''x'')cos(''\u03c6'') is the in-phase component.&nbsp; In both conventions cos(''\u03c6'') is the in-phase amplitude modulation, which explains why some authors refer to it as the actual in-phase component.  We can also observe that in both conventions the quadrature component ''leads'' the in-phase component by one-quarter cycle.\n\n[[File:VI phase.png|thumb|right|250px|When a sinusoidal voltage is applied to either a simple capacitor or inductor, the resultant current that flows is \"in quadrature\" with the voltage.]]\n\n===Alternating current (AC) circuits===\n\nThe term ''alternating current'' applies to a voltage vs time function that is sinusoidal with a [[frequency]], <math>\\scriptstyle f,</math>&nbsp; of 50 or 60 [[Hertz|Hz]].  When it is applied to a typical circuit or device, it causes a current that is also sinusoidal.  And in general there is a constant phase difference, ''\u03c6'', between the two sinusoids.  The sinusoidal voltage stimulus is usually defined to have zero phase, meaning that it is arbitrarily chosen as a convenient time reference.  So the phase difference is attributed to the current function, e.g. &nbsp;<math>\\scriptstyle \\sin(2\\pi ft+\\phi),</math>&nbsp; whose orthogonal components are &nbsp;<math>\\scriptstyle \\sin(2\\pi ft)\\cos(\\phi)</math>&nbsp; and &nbsp;<math>\\scriptstyle \\sin(2\\pi ft+\\pi/2)\\sin(\\phi),</math>&nbsp; as we have seen.&nbsp; When ''\u03c6'' happens to be such that the in-phase component is zero, the current and voltage sinusoids are said to be '''''in quadrature''''', which means they are orthogonal to each other.  In that case, no electrical power is consumed.  Rather it is temporarily stored by the device and given back, once every <math>\\scriptstyle 1/f</math>&nbsp; seconds.&nbsp; Note that the term ''in quadrature'' only implies that two sinusoids are orthogonal, not that they are ''components'' of another sinusoid.\n\n===Narrowband signal model===\n\nIn an angle modulation application, with [[carrier frequency]] <math>\\scriptstyle f,</math>&nbsp; ''\u03c6'' is also a time-variant function, giving''':'''\n\n:<math>\n\\sin[2\\pi ft + \\phi(t)]\\ =\\ \\underbrace{\n\\sin(2\\pi ft)\\cdot \\cos[\\phi(t)]}_{\\text {in-phase}\n}\\ +\\ \\underbrace{\n\\overbrace{\n\\sin\\left(2\\pi ft + \\tfrac{\\pi}{2} \\right)}^{\\cos(2\\pi ft)\n}\\cdot \\sin[\\phi(t)]\n}_{\\text {quadrature}}.\n</math>\n\nWhen all three terms above are multiplied by an optional amplitude function, ''A''(''t'')>0,&nbsp; the left-hand side of the equality is known as the ''amplitude/phase'' form, and the right-hand side is the ''quadrature-carrier'' or ''IQ'' form.  Because of the modulation, the components are no longer completely orthogonal functions.  But when ''A''(''t'') and ''\u03c6''(''t'') are slowly varying functions compared to <math>\\scriptstyle 2\\pi ft,</math>&nbsp; the assumption of orthogonality is a common one.  Authors often call it a ''narrowband assumption'', or a '''narrowband signal model'''.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last =Wade\n | first =Graham\n | title =Signal Coding and Processing\n | publisher =Cambridge University Press\n | volume =1\n | edition =2\n | date =1994-09-30\n | page =10\n | isbn =0521412307 }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n | last =Naidu\n | first =Prabhakar S.\n | title =Modern Digital Signal Processing: An Introduction\n | publisher =Alpha Science Intl Ltd\n | date =November 2003\n | location =Pangbourne RG8 8UT, UK\n | pages =29\u201331\n | isbn =1842651331 }}\n</ref>&nbsp; Orthogonality is important in many applications, including demodulation, direction-finding, and bandpass sampling.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Constellation diagram]]\n* [[Phasor]]\n* [[Polar modulation]]\n* [[Quadrature amplitude modulation]]\n* [[Single-sideband modulation]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book\n | last =Steinmetz\n | first =Charles Proteus\n | title =Lectures on Electrical Engineering\n | publisher =Dover Publications\n | volume =3\n | edition =1\n | date =2003-02-20\n | location =Mineola,NY\n | isbn =0486495388 }}\n*Steinmetz, Charles Proteus (1917).
