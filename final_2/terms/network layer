The network layer is responsible for [[packet forwarding]] including [[routing]] through intermediate routers, since it knows the address of neighboring network nodes, and it also manages [[quality of service]] (QoS), and recognizes and forwards local host domain messages to the [[Transport layer]] ('''layer 4''').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchunifiedcommunications.techtarget.com/definition/layer-3 |title=Layer 3 |publisher=techtarget.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-29}}</ref> The [[data link layer]] ('''layer 2''') is responsible for [[media access control]], [[flow control (data)|flow control]] and [[Data link layer#Error detection and correction|error checking]].\n\n==Functions==\nThe network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable-length [[data]] sequences from a source to a destination host via one or more networks, while maintaining the [[quality of service]] functions.\n\nFunctions of the network layer include:\n* Connection model: [[connectionless]] communication\n: For example, [[Internet Protocol|IP]] is connectionless, in that a datagram can travel from a sender to a recipient without the recipient having to send an acknowledgement. Connection-oriented protocols exist at other, higher layers of the OSI model.\n* Host addressing\n:Every host in the network must have a unique address that determines where it is. This address is normally assigned from a hierarchical system.  For example, you can be \"Fred Murphy\" to people in your house, \"Fred Murphy, 1 Main Street\" to Dubliners, or \"Fred Murphy, 1 Main Street, Dublin\" to people in Ireland, or \"Fred Murphy, 1 Main Street, Dublin, Ireland\" to people anywhere in the world. On the Internet, addresses are known as [[IP address|Internet Protocol (IP) addresses]].\n* Message forwarding\n:Since many networks are partitioned into subnetworks and connect to other networks for wide-area communications, networks use specialized hosts, called gateways or [[Router (computing)|routers]], to forward packets between networks. This is also of interest to mobile applications, where a user may move from one location to another, and it must be arranged that his messages follow him. Version 4 of the [[Internet Protocol]] ([[IPv4]]) was not designed with this feature in mind, although mobility extensions exist. [[IPv6]] has a better designed solution.\n\nWithin the service layering semantics of the OSI network architecture, the network layer responds to service requests from the [[transport layer]] and issues service requests to the [[data link layer]].\n\n==Protocols==\n* DDP, [[Datagram Delivery Protocol]]\n* DVMRP, [[DVMRP|Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol]]\n* ICMP, [[Internet Control Message Protocol]]\n* IGMP, [[IGMP|Internet Group Management Protocol]]\n* IPsec, [[IPsec|Internet Protocol Security]]\n* IPv4/IPv6, [[Internet Protocol]]\n* IPX, [[IPX|Internetwork Packet Exchange]]\n* PIM-DM, [[Protocol Independent Multicast|Protocol Independent Multicast Dense Mode]]\n* PIM-SM, [[Protocol Independent Multicast|Protocol Independent Multicast Sparse Mode]]\n* RIP, [[Routing Information Protocol]]\n* RSMLT [[Routed-SMLT]]\n\n==Relation to TCP/IP model==\nThe [[TCP/IP model]]  describes the protocols used by the Internet.<ref>RFC 1122</ref> The TCP/IP model has a layer called the [[Internet layer]], located above the [[link layer]]. In many textbooks and other secondary references, the TCP/IP Internet layer is equated with the OSI network layer. However, this comparison is misleading, as the allowed characteristics of protocols (e.g., whether they are connection-oriented or connection-less) placed into these layers are different in the two models.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} The TCP/IP Internet layer is in fact only a subset of functionality of the network layer. It describes only one type of network architecture, the Internet.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Datakit]]\n* [[Router (computing)|Router]]\n* [[DECnet]]\n* [[AppleTalk]]\n* [[LAN Switches]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book |first=Andrew S. |last=Tanenbaum |title=Computer networks |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=[[Upper Saddle River, New Jersey]] |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-13-066102-3}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.136.9497&rep=rep1&type=pdf OSI Reference Model\u2014The ISO Model of Architecture for Open Systems Interconnection], Hubert Zimmermann, IEEE Transactions on Communications, vol. 28, no. 4, April 1980, pp.&nbsp;425 \u2013 432.
