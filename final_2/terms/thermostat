Often they combine both the sensing and control action elements of control system, such as in an automotive thermostat.\n\n==Overview==\nA thermostat exerts control by switching heating or cooling devices on or off, or by regulating the flow of a heat transfer fluid as needed, to maintain the correct temperature. Thermostats are used in any device or system that heats or cools to a setpoint temperature, examples include building [[heating]], [[central heating]], [[air conditioning|air conditioners]], [[HVAC]] systems, as well as kitchen equipment including [[oven]]s and [[refrigerator]]s and medical and scientific [[incubator (culture)|incubator]]s.\n\n==Construction==\nThermostats can be constructed in many ways and may use a variety of [[sensor]]s to measure the temperature, commonly a [[thermistor]] or [[bimetallic strip]]. The output of the sensor then controls the heating or cooling apparatus. A thermostat is most often an instance of a \"[[Bang\u2013bang control|bang-bang controller]]\" as the heating or cooling equipment interface is not typically controlled in a proportional manner to the difference between actual temperature and the temperature [[setpoint (control system)|setpoint]]. Instead, the heating or cooling equipment runs at full capacity until the set temperature is reached, then shuts off. Increasing the difference between the thermostat setting and the desired temperature therefore does not shorten the time to achieve the desired temperature. A thermostat may have a maximum switching frequency, or switch heating and cooling equipment on and off at temperatures either side of the setpoint. This reduces the risk of equipment damage from frequent switching.\n\nThe term thermostat is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 ''thermos'', \"hot\" and \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 ''statos'', \"standing, stationary\".\n\n==Sensor types==\nEarly technologies included mercury thermometers with electrodes inserted directly through the glass, so that when a certain (fixed) temperature was reached the contacts would be closed by the mercury. These were accurate to within a degree of temperature.\n\nCommon sensor technologies in use today include:\n\n* [[Bimetal]]lic mechanical or electrical sensors.\n* [[Wax thermostatic element|Expanding wax pellets]]\n* Electronic [[thermistor]]s and [[semiconductor devices]]\n* Electrical [[thermocouple]]s\nThese may then control the heating or cooling apparatus using:\n* Direct mechanical control\n* Electrical signals\n* Pneumatic signals\n\n==History==\nPossibly the earliest recorded examples of thermostat control were built by the Dutch innovator [[Cornelis Drebbel]] (1572\u20131633) around 1620 in England. He invented a [[mercury (element)|mercury]] thermostat to regulate the temperature of a chicken [[wikt:incubator|incubator]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drebbel.net/Tierie.pdf|title=Tierie, Gerrit. Cornelis Drebbel. Amsterdam: HJ Paris, 1932.|accessdate=May 3, 2013}}</ref> This is one of the first recorded [[feedback|feedback-controlled]] devices.\n\nModern thermostat control was developed in the 1830s by [[Andrew Ure]] (1778\u20131857), a Scottish chemist, who invented the bi-metallic thermostat. The textile mills of the time needed a constant and steady temperature to operate optimally, so to achieve this, Ure designed the bimetallic thermostat, which would bend as one of the metals expanded in response to the increased temperature and cut off the energy supply.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.achrnews.com/articles/87035-an-early-history-of-comfort-heating |title=An Early History Of Comfort Heating |author= |date=November 6, 2001 |work=The NEWS Magazine |publisher=BNP Media |location=Troy, Michigan |accessdate=November 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe first electric room thermostat was invented in 1883 by [[Warren S.

The incubators incorporated an accurate thermostat to regulate the temperature so as to precisely simulate the experience of an egg being hatched naturally.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Falk |first1=Cynthia G. |title=Barns of New York: Rural Architecture of the Empire State |year=2012 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location= Ithaca, New York |publication-date=May 1, 2012 |format=paperback |edition=First |isbn= 978-0-8014-7780-5 |url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100673280 |accessdate=November 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Mechanical thermostats==\nThis covers only devices which both sense and control using purely mechanical means.\n\n===Bimetal===\nDomestic water and steam based central heating systems have traditionally been controlled by bi-metallic strip thermostats, and this is dealt with later in this article. Purely mechanical control has been localised [[steam]] or hot-water [[radiator]] bi-metallic thermostats which [[wikt:regulate|regulated]] the individual flow. However, [[Thermostatic Radiator Valve]]s (TRV) are now being widely used.\n\nPurely mechanical thermostats are used to regulate dampers in some rooftop turbine vents, reducing building heat loss in cool or cold periods.\n\nSome automobile passenger heating systems have a thermostatically controlled valve to regulate the water flow and temperature to an adjustable level. In older vehicles the thermostat controls the application of engine vacuum to actuators that control water valves and flappers to direct the flow of air. In modern vehicles, the vacuum actuators may be operated by small [[solenoids]] under the control of a central computer.\n\n===Wax pellet===\n\n====Automotive====\n{{main article|Wax thermostatic element}}\n[[File:carthermostat.jpg|thumb|right|Car engine thermostat]]\nPerhaps the most common example of purely mechanical thermostat technology in use today is the [[internal combustion engine]] cooling system thermostat, used to maintain the engine near its optimum [[operating temperature]] by regulating the flow of [[coolant]] to an air-cooled [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]]. This type of thermostat operates using a sealed chamber containing a wax pellet that melts and expands at a set temperature. The expansion of the chamber operates a rod which opens a [[valve]] when the operating temperature is exceeded. The operating temperature is determined by the composition of the wax.  Once the operating temperature is reached, the thermostat progressively increases or decreases its opening in response to temperature changes, dynamically balancing the coolant recirculation flow and coolant flow to the radiator to maintain the engine temperature in the optimum range.\n \nOn many automobile engines, including all Chrysler Group and General Motors products, the thermostat does not restrict flow to the heater core. The passenger side tank of the radiator is used as a bypass to the thermostat, flowing through the heater core. This prevents formation of steam pockets before the thermostat opens, and allows the heater to function before the thermostat opens. Another benefit is that there is still some flow through the radiator if the thermostat fails.\n\n====Shower and other hot water controls====\nA [[thermostatic mixing valve]] uses a wax pellet to control the mixing of hot and cold water.  A common application is to permit operation of an electric water heater at a temperature hot enough to kill [[Legionella]] bacteria (above {{convert|60|C}}), while the output of the valve produces water that is cool enough to not immediately scald ({{convert|49|C}}).\n\n===Gas expansion===\nThermostats are sometimes used to regulate gas ovens. It consists of a gas-filled bulb connected to the control unit by a slender copper tube. The bulb is normally located at the top of the oven. The tube ends in a chamber sealed by a diaphragm. As the thermostat heats up, the gas expands applying pressure to the diaphragm which reduces the flow of gas to the burner.\n\n===Pneumatic thermostats===\nA pneumatic thermostat is a thermostat that controls a heating or cooling system via a series of air-filled control tubes. This \"control air\" system responds to the pressure changes (due to temperature) in the control tube to activate heating or cooling when required.  The control air typically is maintained on \"mains\" at 15-18psi (although usually operable up to 20&nbsp;psi). Pneumatic thermostats typically provide output/ branch/ post-restrictor(for single-pipe operation) pressures of 3-15psi which is piped to the end device (valve/ damper actuator/ Pneumatic-Electric switch, etc.).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dr-fix-it.com/pneum1.html |title= Dr-Fix-It Explains a Common Pneumatic Comfort Control Circuit |date= 2005 |website= dr-fix-it.com |publisher= RTWEB |accessdate= November 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe pneumatic thermostat was invented by Warren Johnson in 1895<ref>Fehring, T.H., ed., ''Mechanical Engineering: A Century of Progress,'' NorCENergy Consultants, LLC, October 10, 1980 - Technology & Engineering, p. 22</ref> soon after he invented the electric thermostat. In 2009, Harry Sim was awarded a patent for a pneumatic-to-digital interface<ref>http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20090192653.pdf</ref> that allows pneumatically controlled buildings to be integrated with building automation systems to provide similar benefits as [[Direct digital control|DDC]].\n\n==Electrical and analog electronic thermostats==\n\n===Bimetallic switching thermostats===\n[[File:OfficeThermostat.jpg|thumb|right|Bimetallic thermostat for buildings.]]\nWater and steam based central heating systems have traditionally had overall control by wall-mounted bi-metallic strip thermostats. These sense the air temperature using the differential expansion of two metals to actuate an on/off switch. Typically the central system would be switched on when the temperature drops below the set point on the thermostat, and switched off when it rises above, with a few degrees of [[hysteresis]] to prevent excessive switching. Bi-metallic sensing is now being superseded by electronic [[sensor]]s. A principal use of the bi-metallic thermostat today is in individual electric convection heaters, where control is on/off, based on the local air temperature and the set point desired by the user. These are also used on air-conditioners, where local control is required.\n\n===Simple two wire thermostats===\n[[File:WPThermostat new.jpg|thumb|right|Millivolt thermostat mechanism]]\n<!-- Edited to clarify. Millivolt systems, 24 V systems and direct-control are subsets of the two wire thermostat. -->\nThe illustration is the interior of a common two wire heat-only household thermostat, used to regulate a [[natural gas|gas]]-fired heater via an electric gas valve. Similar mechanisms may also be used to control oil furnaces, boilers, boiler [[zone valve]]s, electric attic fans, electric furnaces, electric baseboard heaters, and household appliances such as refrigerators, coffee pots and hair dryers. The power through the thermostat is provided by the heating device and may range from [[volt|millivolts]] to 240 [[volt]]s in common North American construction, and is used to control the heating system either directly (electric baseboard heaters and some electric furnaces) or indirectly (all gas, oil and forced hot water systems). ''Due to the variety of possible [[voltage]]s and [[Electric current|current]]s available at the thermostat, caution must be taken when selecting a replacement device.''\n\n# Set point control [[lever]]. This is moved to the right for a higher temperature. The round indicator pin in the center of the second slot shows through a numbered slot in the outer case.\n# [[Bimetallic strip]] wound into a coil. The center of the coil is attached to a rotating post attached to lever (1). As the coil gets colder the moving end&nbsp;&mdash; carrying (4)&nbsp;&mdash; moves [[clockwise and counterclockwise|clockwise]].\n# Flexible wire. The left side is connected via one wire of a pair to the heater control valve.\n# Moving contact attached to the bimetal coil. Thence, to the heater's controller.\n# [[Magnet]]. This ensures a good contact when the contact closes.  It also provides [[hysteresis]] to prevent short heating cycles, as the temperature must be raised several [[degree (temperature)|degree]]s before the contacts will open. As an alternative, some thermostats instead use a [[mercury switch]] on the end of the bimetal coil.  The weight of the mercury on the end of the coil tends to keep it there, also preventing short heating cycles.  However, this type of thermostat is banned in many countries due to its highly and permanently [[toxic]] nature if broken. When replacing these thermostats they must be regarded as [[chemical waste]].\n# Fixed contact screw. This is adjusted by the [[manufacturer]]. It is connected electrically by a second wire of the pair to the thermocouple and the heater's electrically operated gas valve.\n\nNot shown in the illustration is a separate bimetal thermometer on the outer case to show the actual temperature at the thermostat.\n\n====Millivolt thermostats====\nAs illustrated in the use of the thermostat above, all of the power for the control system is provided by a [[thermopile]] which is a combination of many stacked thermocouples, heated by the pilot light. The thermopile produces sufficient electrical power to drive a low-power gas valve, which under control of one or more thermostat switches, in turn controls the input of fuel to the burner.\n\nThis type of device is generally considered obsolete as pilot lights can waste a surprising amount of gas (in the same way a dripping faucet can waste a large amount of water over an extended period), and are also no longer used on stoves, but are still to be found in many gas water heaters and gas fireplaces. Their poor efficiency is acceptable in water heaters, since most of the energy \"wasted\" on the pilot still represents a direct heat gain for the water tank. The Millivolt system also makes it unnecessary for a special electrical circuit to be run to the water heater or furnace; these systems are often completely self-sufficient and can run without any external electrical power supply.  For tankless \"on demand\" water heaters, pilot ignition is preferable because it is faster than hot-surface ignition and more reliable than spark ignition.\n\nSome [[programmable thermostat]]s - those that offer simple \"millivolt\" or \"two-wire\" modes - will control these systems.\n\n====24 volt thermostats====\nThe majority of modern heating/cooling/heat pump thermostats operate on low voltage (typically 24 volts [[Alternating current|AC]]) control circuits. The source of the 24 volt AC power is a control transformer installed as part of the heating/cooling equipment. The advantage of the low voltage control system is the ability to operate multiple electromechanical switching devices such as [[relay]]s, contactors, and sequencers using inherently safe voltage and current levels.<ref>Electrical potentials at and below 24 volts are classed as \"Safety Extra-Low Voltage\" under most [[electrical code]]s when supplied through an isolation transformer.</ref> Built into the thermostat is a provision for enhanced temperature control using anticipation.  A heat anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the heating appliance is operating.  This opens the heating contacts slightly early to prevent the space temperature from greatly overshooting the thermostat setting.  A mechanical heat anticipator is generally adjustable and should be set to the current flowing in the heating control circuit when the system is operating. A cooling anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the cooling appliance is not operating. This causes the contacts to energize the cooling equipment slightly early, preventing the space temperature from climbing excessively. Cooling anticipators are generally non-adjustable.\n\nElectromechanical thermostats use resistance elements as anticipators. Most electronic thermostats use either thermistor devices or integrated logic elements for the anticipation function.  In some electronic thermostats, the thermistor anticipator may be located outdoors, providing a variable anticipation depending on the outdoor temperature. Thermostat enhancements include outdoor temperature display, programmability, and system fault indication. While such 24 volt thermostats are incapable of operating a furnace when the mains power fails, most such furnaces require mains power for heated air fans (and often also hot-surface or electronic spark ignition) rendering moot the functionality of the thermostat. In other circumstances such as piloted wall and \"gravity\" (fanless) floor and central heaters the low voltage system described previously may be capable of remaining functional when electrical power is unavailable.\n\nThere are no standards for wiring color codes, but convention has settled on the following terminal codes and colors.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sawyer|first1=\"Doc\"|title=Thermostat Wire  Color Codes|url=http://www.dr-fix-it.com/ttt/10005.html|website=dr-fix-it.com|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Transtronics, Inc.|title=Thermostat signals and wiring|url=http://wiki.xtronics.com/index.php/Thermostat_signals_and_wiring|website=wiki.xtronics.com|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref>\nIn all cases, the manufacturer's instructions should be considered definitive.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

If a line voltage thermostat is used, system power (in the United States, 120 or 240 volts) is directly switched by the thermostat. With switching [[Electric current|current]] often exceeding 40 [[ampere]]s, using a low voltage thermostat on a line voltage circuit will result at least in the failure of the thermostat and possibly a fire.  Line voltage thermostats are sometimes used in other applications, such as the control of [[fan-coil]] (fan powered from line voltage blowing through a coil of tubing which is either heated or cooled by a larger system) <!-- Nonsense sentence.  How can line voltage \"blow through a coil of tubing\"? --> units in large systems using centralized [[boiler]]s and [[chiller]]s, or to control circulation pumps in hydronic heating applications.\n\nSome programmable thermostats are available to control line-voltage systems. Baseboard heaters will especially benefit from a programmable thermostat which is capable of continuous control (as are at least some [[Honeywell]] models), effectively controlling the heater like a lamp dimmer, and gradually increasing and decreasing heating to ensure an extremely constant room temperature (continuous control rather than relying on the averaging effects of hysteresis). Systems which include a fan (electric furnaces, wall heaters, etc.) must typically use simple on/off controls.\n\n==Digital electronic thermostats==\n{{see also|Programmable thermostat}}\n[[File:Electronic Thermostat.jpg|thumb|Residential digital thermostat]]\n[[File:Lux Products Touch Screen Thermostat.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lux Products]]' Model TX9000TS Touch Screen Thermostat.]]\n[[File:Lux Products WIN100 Thermostat.jpg|thumb|right|Lux Products WIN100 Heating & Cooling Programmable Outlet Thermostat shown with control door closed and open.]]\n\nNewer [[Digital data|digital]] thermostats have no [[mechanism (technology)|moving parts]] to [[measurement|measure]] temperature and instead rely on [[thermistor]]s or other [[semiconductor devices]] such as a [[resistance thermometer]] (resistance temperature detector). Typically one or more regular [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] must be installed to operate it, although some so-called \"power stealing\" digital thermostats use the common 24 volt AC circuits as a power source, but will not operate on [[thermopile]] powered \"millivolt\" circuits used in some furnaces.  Each has an [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] screen showing the current temperature, and the current setting.  Most also have a [[clock]], and time-of-day and even day-of-week settings for the temperature, used for [[comfort]] and [[energy conservation]].  Some advanced models have [[touch screen]]s, or the ability to work with [[home automation]] or [[building automation]] systems.\n\nDigital thermostats use either a relay or a [[semiconductor device]] such as [[TRIAC|triac]] to act as a switch to control the [[HVAC]] unit.  Units with relays will operate millivolt systems, but often make an audible \"click\" noise when switching on or off.\n\nMore expensive models have a built-in [[PID controller]], so that the thermostat knows ahead how the system will react to its commands.  For instance, setting it up so that the temperature in the morning at 7&nbsp;a.m. should be 21&nbsp;\u00b0C (69.8&nbsp;\u00b0F), makes sure that at that time the temperature will be 21&nbsp;\u00b0C (69.8&nbsp;\u00b0F), where a conventional thermostat would just start working at that time.  The PID controller decides at what time the system should be activated in order to reach the desired temperature at the desired time. It also makes sure that the temperature is very stable (for instance, by reducing overshoots{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}).\n\nMost digital thermostats in common residential use in North America and Europe are [[programmable thermostat]]s, which will typically provide a 30% energy savings if left with their default programs; adjustments to these defaults may increase or reduce energy savings.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The [[programmable thermostat]] article provides basic information on the operation, selection and installation of such a thermostat.\n\n==Thermostats and HVAC operation==\n\n===Ignition sequences in modern conventional systems===\n* Gas\n:# Start drafting fan (if the furnace is relatively recent) to create a column of air flowing up the chimney\n:# Heat ignitor or start spark-ignition system\n:# Open gas valve to ignite main burners\n:# Wait (if furnace is relatively recent) until the [[heat exchanger]] is at proper operating temperature before starting main blower fan or circulator pump\n* Oil\n:# Similar to gas, except rather than opening a valve, the furnace will start an oil pump to inject oil into the burner\n* Electric\n:# The blower fan or circulator pump will be started, and a large electromechanical relay or [[TRIAC]] will turn on the [[heating element]]s\n* Coal (including grains such as corn, wheat, and barley, or pellets made of wood, bark, or cardboard)\n:# Generally rare today (though grains and pellets are increasing in popularity); similar to gas, except rather than opening a valve, the furnace will start a [[Archimedes' screw|screw]] to drive coal/grain/pellets into the firebox\n\nWith non-zoned (typical residential, one thermostat for the whole house) systems, when the thermostat's R (or Rh) and W terminals are connected, the furnace will go through its start-up procedure and produce heat.\n\nWith zoned systems (some residential, many commercial systems&nbsp;&mdash; several thermostats controlling different \"zones\" in the building), the thermostat will cause small electric motors to open valves or dampers and start the furnace or boiler if it's not already running.\n\nMost programmable thermostats will control these systems.\n\n===Combination heating/cooling regulation===\nDepending on what is being controlled, a [[forced-air]] [[air conditioning]] thermostat generally has an external [[switch]] for heat/off/cool, and another on/auto to turn the [[fan (mechanical)|blower fan]] on constantly or only when heating and cooling are running.  Four [[wire]]s come to the centrally-located thermostat from the main heating/cooling unit (usually located in a [[closet]], [[basement]], or occasionally in the [[attic]]): One wire, usually red, supplies 24 volts AC power to the thermostat, while the other three supply control signals from the thermostat, usually white for heat, yellow for cooling, and green to turn on the blower fan.  The power is supplied by a [[transformer]], and when the thermostat makes contact between the 24 volt power and one or two of the other wires, a relay back at the heating/cooling unit activates the corresponding heat/fan/cool function of the unit(s).\n\nA thermostat, when set to \"cool\", will only turn on when the ambient temperature of the surrounding room is above the set temperature.  Thus, if the controlled space has a temperature normally above the desired setting when the heating/cooling system is off, it would be wise to keep the thermostat set to \"cool\", despite what the temperature is outside.  On the other hand, if the temperature of the controlled area falls below the desired degree, then it is advisable to turn the thermostat to \"heat\".\n\n===Heat pump regulation===\n[[File:Thermostat-engineerguy.ogv|thumb|Thermostat design]]\nThe [[heat pump]] is a refrigeration based appliance which reverses refrigerant flow between the indoor and outdoor coils.  This is done by energizing a [[reversing valve]] (also known as a \"4-way\" or \"change-over\" valve).  During cooling, the indoor coil is an evaporator removing heat from the indoor air and transferring it to the outdoor coil where it is rejected to the outdoor air.  During heating, the outdoor coil becomes the evaporator and heat is removed from the outdoor air and transferred to the indoor air through the indoor coil.  The reversing valve, controlled by the thermostat, causes the change-over from heat to cool.  Residential heat pump thermostats generally have an \"O\" terminal to energize the reversing valve in cooling. Some residential and many commercial heat pump thermostats use a \"B\" terminal to energize the reversing valve in heating.  The heating capacity of a heat pump decreases as outdoor temperatures fall. At some outdoor temperature (called the balance point) the ability of the refrigeration system to transfer heat into the building falls below the heating needs of the building.  A typical heat pump is fitted with electric heating elements to supplement the refrigeration heat when the outdoor temperature is below this balance point.  Operation of the supplemental heat is controlled by a second stage heating contact in the heat pump thermostat.  During heating, the outdoor coil is operating at a temperature below the outdoor temperature and condensation on the coil may take place.  This condensation may then freeze onto the coil, reducing its heat transfer capacity.  Heat pumps therefore have a provision for occasional defrost of the outdoor coil.  This is done by reversing the cycle to the cooling mode, shutting off the outdoor fan, and energizing the electric heating elements.  The electric heat in defrost mode is needed to keep the system from blowing cold air inside the building.  The elements are then used in the \"reheat\" function. Although the thermostat may indicate the system is in defrost and electric heat is activated, the defrost function is not controlled by the thermostat. Since the heat pump has electric heat elements for supplemental and reheats, the heat pump thermostat provides for use of the electric heat elements should the refrigeration system fail.  This function is normally activated by an \"E\" terminal on the thermostat.  When in emergency heat, the thermostat makes no attempt to operate the compressor or outdoor fan.\n\n===Thermostat location===\nThe thermostat should not be located on an outside wall or where it could be exposed to direct sunlight at any time during the day. It should be located away from the room's cooling or heating vents or device, yet exposed to general airflow from the room(s) to be regulated.<ref>{{cite web|last=KMC Controls|title=Thinking about Thermostats|url=http://www.kmccontrols.com/products/thermostats.aspx|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}</ref>  An open hallway may be most appropriate for a single zone system, where living rooms and bedrooms are operated as a single zone. If the hallway may be closed by doors from the regulated spaces then these should be left open when the system is in use. If the thermostat is too close to the source controlled then the system will tend to \"short cycle\", and numerous starts and stops can be annoying and in some cases shorten equipment life. A multiple zoned system can save considerable energy by regulating individual spaces, allowing unused rooms to vary in temperature by turning off the heating and cooling.\n\n=== Dummy thermostats ===\nIt has been reported that many thermostats in office buildings are non-functional dummy devices, installed to give tenants' employees an [[illusion of control]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1042577628591401304.html|title=Employees Only Think They Control Thermostat |last=Sandberg|first=Jared|date=January 15, 2003|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=September 2, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.thomasnet.com/IMT/archives/2003/04/dummy_thermosta.html|title=\"Dummy\" Thermostats Cool Down Tempers, Not Temperatures|author=Katrina C.
