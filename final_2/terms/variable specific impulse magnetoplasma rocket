It uses [[radio wave]]s to [[ionization|ionize]] and heat a [[propellant]]. Then a [[magnetic field]] accelerates the resulting [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] to generate [[thrust]] ([[plasma propulsion engine]]). It is one of several types of spacecraft [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] systems.\n\nThe VASIMR method for heating [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] was originally developed from [[nuclear fusion]] research. VASIMR is intended to bridge the gap between high-[[thrust]], low-[[specific impulse]] and low-thrust, high-specific impulse systems. VASIMR is capable of functioning in either mode. Former NASA astronaut [[Franklin Chang D\u00edaz]] created the VASIMR concept and has been developing it since 1977.<ref name=\"seed\">{{cite journal |url=http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/a_rocket_for_the_21st_century/ |title=A Rocket for the 21st Century |journal=[[Seed (magazine)|Seed]] |first=Lee |last=Billings |date=September 29, 2009 |accessdate=September 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\nVASIMRs units for development and test are assembled by [[Ad Astra Rocket Company]].<ref name=\"Ad_Astra\">{{cite web |title=About us |url=http://www.adastrarocket.com/aarc/about-us |publisher=Ad Astra Rocket Company |accessdate=February 22, 2014}}</ref>\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n== Design and operation ==\n[[File:VASIMR system.jpg|thumb|300px|VASIMR schematic]]\nVASIMR, sometimes referred to as the Electro-thermal Plasma Thruster or Electro-thermal Magnetoplasma Rocket, uses radio waves<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/plant/features/industry/article.jsp?content=20100513_153743_3324 |title=Nautel\u2019s space oddity (RF generator for Ad Astra) |date=May 13, 2010 |author=Noelle Stapinsky |publisher=Canadian Manufacturing |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

This engine is electrodeless, of the same [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] family as the [[electrodeless plasma thruster]], the microwave arcjet or the [[pulsed inductive thruster]] class. It has been described as an electrodeless version of an [[arcjet rocket]] that can reach higher propellant temperature by limiting the heat flux from the plasma to the structure. Neither type of engine uses [[electrode]]s. This eliminates the electrode erosion that shortens the equipment life of rival [[ion thruster]] designs. Since every part of a VASIMR engine is [[Magnetic mirror#Magnetic bottles|magnetically shielded]] and does not directly contact plasma, the durability of this engine is predicted to be greater than many other ion/plasma engines.<ref name=\"seed\"/>\n\nVASIMR has been described as a convergent-divergent nozzle for ions and electrons. The propellant (a neutral gas such as [[argon]] or [[xenon]]) is injected into a hollow cylinder surfaced with electromagnets. On entering the engine, the gas is first heated to a \u201ccold plasma\u201d by a helicon RF antenna (also known as a \u201ccoupler\u201d) that bombards the gas with electromagnetic waves, stripping electrons off the propellant atoms and producing a plasma of ions and loose electrons that flow down the engine compartment. By varying the amount of energy dedicated to RF heating and the amount of propellant delivered for plasma generation, VASIMR is capable of generating either low-thrust, high\u2013specific impulse exhaust or relatively high-thrust, low\u2013specific impulse exhaust.<ref name=\"Principal VASIMR results\">{{cite web |url=http://www.adastrarocket.com/TimSTAIF2005.pdf |title=Principal VASIMR Results and Present Objectives |date=February 13\u201317, 2005 |author=Tim W.

Resonance is achieved through a reduction of the magnetic field in this portion of the engine that slows the orbital motion of the plasma particles. This section further heats the plasma to greater than 1,000,000&nbsp;[[kelvin]]\u2014about 173 times the temperature of the [[Sun]]\u2019s surface.<ref name=\"Air_March_2004\">{{cite news|author=Beth Dickey|title=Star Power|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/space/star-power-6700758|accessdate=February 7, 2014|newspaper=Air & Space, Smithsonian|date=March 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe path of ions and electrons through the engine approximates lines parallel to the engine walls; however, the particles actually orbit those lines while traveling linearly through the engine. The final, diverging, section of the engine contains an expanding magnetic field that drives the ions and electrons in steadily expanding spirals and ejects them from the engine, parallel and opposite to the direction of motion at velocities as great as 50,000&nbsp;m/s.<ref name=\"Principal VASIMR results\"/><ref name=\"VASIMR-Technology\">{{cite web |url=http://www.adastrarocket.com/aarc/Technology |title=Technology |date=2009 |author=Ad Astra Rocket Company |publisher=Ad Astra Rocket Company |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Advantages and drawbacks ===\nIn contrast to the typical [[cyclotron resonance]] heating processes, VASIMR ions are immediately ejected from the magnetic nozzle before they achieve [[Thermalisation|thermalized distribution]]. Based on novel theoretical work in 2004 by Alexey V. Arefiev and Boris N. Breizman of [[University of Texas at Austin]], virtually all of the energy in the ion [[cyclotron]] wave is uniformly transferred to ionized plasma in a single-pass cyclotron absorption process. This allows for ions to leave the magnetic nozzle with a very narrow energy distribution, and for significantly simplified and compact magnet arrangement in the engine.<ref name=\"Principal VASIMR results\"/>\n\nVASIMR does not use electrodes; instead, it magnetically shields plasma from most hardware parts, thus eliminating electrode erosion, a major source of wear in ion engines.<ref name=Engine_2003>{{cite web|display-authors=7|author=Jared P.

Important refinements were introduced to the rocket concept in the 1990s, including the use of the \"helicon\" plasma source, which replaced the plasma gun originally envisioned and made the rocket completely \"electrodeless\"\u2014adding to durability and long life. A new [[patent]] was granted in 2002.\n\nIn 1995, the Advanced Space Propulsion Laboratory (ASPL) was founded at [[NASA]] [[Lyndon B.

This will allow first high power plasma firings of the engines, with a stated goal to reach 100h/100kW by mid-2018.\n<ref>[adastrarocket.com/pressReleases/AdAstra-Release-080316-final.pdf AD ASTRA ROCKET COMPANY SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES ALL NASA NEXTSTEP CONTRACT MILESTONES FOR YEAR ONE, RECEIVES NASA APPROVAL TO PROCEED WITH YEAR TWO.]. PRESS RELEASE 080316, August 3, 2016</ref>\n\n== Potential applications ==\nVASIMR is not suitable to launch payloads from the Earth's surface because it has a low thrust-to-weight ratio and requires an ambient vacuum. Instead, the engine would function as an upper stage for cargo, reducing fuel requirements for in-space transport. The engine is anticipated to perform the following functions at a fraction of the cost of chemical technologies:\n* drag compensation for space stations\n* lunar cargo delivery\n* satellite repositioning\n* satellite refueling, maintenance and repair\n* in space resource recovery\n* deep space robotic missions\n\nOther applications for VASIMR such as the rapid transportation of people to Mars would require a very high power, low mass energy source, such as a nuclear reactor (see [[nuclear electric rocket]]). In 2010 NASA Administrator [[Charles Bolden]] said that VASIMR technology could be the breakthrough technology that would reduce the travel time on a Mars mission from 2.5 years to 5 months.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morring |first1=Frank |date=2010 |title=Commercial Route |journal=Aviation Week & Space Technology |publisher=McGraw Hill |volume=172 |issue=6 |pages=20\u201323 }}</ref>\n\nIn August 2008, Tim Glover, Ad Astra director of development, publicly stated that the first expected application of VASIMR engine is \"hauling things [non-human cargo] from low-Earth orbit to low-lunar orbit\" supporting NASA's return to Moon efforts.<ref name=\"Discovery News\">{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/08/07/plasma-rocket.html |title=Plasma Rocket May Be Tested at Space Station |date=August 7, 2008 |author=Irene Klotz |publisher=Discovery News |accessdate=February 27, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n=== Space tug/orbital transfer vehicle ===\nThe most important near-term application of VASIMR-powered spacecraft is cargo transport. Studies have shown that, despite longer transit times, VASIMR-powered spacecraft will be much more efficient than traditional integrated chemical rockets when moving goods through space. An [[orbital transfer vehicle]] (OTV)\u2014essentially a \"space tug\"\u2014powered by a single VF-200 engine would be capable of transporting about 7 metric tons of cargo from [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) to low Lunar orbit (LLO) with about a six-month transit time.\n\nNASA envisions delivering about 34 metric tons of useful cargo to LLO in a single flight with a chemically propelled vehicle. To make that trip, about 60 metric tons of LOX-LH2 propellant would be expended. A comparable OTV would employ 5 VF-200 engines powered by a 1 MW solar array. To do the same job, a VASIMR-powered  OTV would need to expend only about 8 metric tons of argon propellant. The total mass of such an electric OTV would be in the range of 49&nbsp;t (outbound & return fuel: 9&nbsp;t, hardware: 6&nbsp;t, cargo 34&nbsp;t).\n\nOTV transit times can be reduced by carrying lighter loads and/or expending more argon propellant with VASIMR throttled up to higher thrust at less efficient (lower ''I<sub>sp</sub>'') operating conditions. For instance, an empty OTV on the return trip to Earth covers the distance in about 23 days at optimal specific impulse of 5,000&nbsp;s (50&nbsp;kN\u00b7s/kg) or in about 14 days at ''I''<sub>sp</sub> of 3,000&nbsp;s (30&nbsp;kN\u00b7s/kg). The total mass of the NASA specifications' OTV (including structure, solar array, fuel tank, avionics, propellant and cargo) was assumed to be 100 metric tons (98.4 [[long tons]]; 110 [[short tons]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adastrarocket.com/Tim_IEPC07.pdf |title=Projected Lunar Cargo Capabilities of High-Power VASIMR Propulsion |date=September 17\u201320, 2007 |author=Tim W.

Zubrin also believes that electric propulsion is not necessary to get to Mars; therefore, budgets should not be assigned to develop it. His second critique concentrates on the lack of a suitable power source.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.spacenews.com/article/vasimr-hoax |date=July 13, 2011 |title=The VASIMR Hoax |first=Robert |last=Zubrin <!-- same exact article: http://www.marssociety.org/home/press/tms-in-the-news/thevasimrhoax -->}}</ref> Ad Astra responded in a press release: \"It is abundantly clear that the nuclear reactor technology required for such missions is not available today and major advances in reactor design and power conversion are needed\" for fast manned Mars transport. Zubrin's [[Mars Direct]] mission plan also calls for nuclear reactors, although for purposes other than propulsion, including fuel production on the surface of Mars. Ad Astra further argued, \"In the near term, using solar-electric power at levels of 100 kW to 1 MW, VASIMR\u00ae propulsion could transfer heavy payloads to Mars using only one to four first-generation thrusters in relatively simple engine architectures.\" <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.adastrarocket.com/VASIMR_development_AdAstra_15July2011.pdf |date=July 15, 2011 |title=Facts About the VASIMR\u00ae Engine and its Development |publisher=Ad Astra Rocket Company}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Comparison of orbital rocket engines]]\n* [[Helicon Double Layer Thruster]]\n* [[Magnetoplasmadynamic thruster]]\n* [[Nano-particle field extraction thruster]]\n* [[Project Prometheus]]\n* [[Pulsed plasma thruster]]\n* [[Safe Affordable Fission Engine]]\n* [[Solar panels on spacecraft]]\n* [[SP-100]]\n* [[Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power]]\n* [[TOPAZ nuclear reactor]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n<!--\nhttp://www.adastrarocket.com/aarc/News\nhttp://www.adastrarocket.com/aarc/PressReleases\n-->\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite news |url=http://www.adastrarocket.com/SciAm2000.pdf |title=The VASIMR Rocket |work=Scientific American |first=Franklin R |last=Chang-D\u00edaz |date=November 2000 |accessdate=November 16, 2009}}\n* {{Cite press release |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/news/releases/2006/J06-009.html |title=Agreement to Commercialize Advanced NASA Rocket Concept; Former Astronaut Franklin Chang-Diaz to Lead Effort |publisher=Johnson Space Center |date=January 23, 2006 |accessdate=January 18, 2008 |id=J06-009}}\n* {{Cite news |url=http://space.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn12064 |title=Plasma rocket breaks endurance record |work=Reuters ''via'' New Scientist |date=August 14, 2007 |accessdate=January 18, 2008}}\n* {{Cite news |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/19427/ |title=Rocket scientist Franklin Chang Diaz talks about finding the power and propulsion required to colonize space |first=Erica |last=Naone |work=Technology Review |date=September 25, 2007 |accessdate=February 27, 2010}}\n* {{Cite web |url=http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/space-flight/rockets-for-the-red-planet/0 |title=Rockets For The Red Planet |work=IEEE Spectrum |first=Sandra |last=Upson |date=June 2009 |accessdate=February 27, 2010}}\n* {{Cite news |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17476-ion-engine-could-one-day-power-39day-trips-to-mars.html?full=true |title=Ion engine could one day power 39-day trips to Mars |work=New Scientist |first=Lisa |last=Grossman |date=July 24, 2009 |accessdate=February 27, 2010}}\n* {{Cite news |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17918-rocket-company-tests-worlds-most-powerful-ion-engine.html?full=true |title=Rocket company tests world's most powerful ion engine |work=New Scientist |first=David |last=Shiga |date=October 5, 2009 |accessdate=February 27, 2010}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|VASIMR}}\n* [http://www.adastrarocket.com/ Ad Astra Rocket Company]\n* [http://www.adastrarocket.com/aarc/Technology Comparison of rocket technologies] at Adastrarocket.com\n* [http://science.discovery.com/videos/brink-package-plasma-rocket.html \"Plasma Rocket\"] (Video).
