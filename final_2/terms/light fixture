All light fixtures have a fixture body and  a light socket to hold the lamp and allow for its replacement. Fixtures may also have a switch to control the light. Fixtures require an [[electrical connection]] to a power source; permanent lighting may be directly wired, and moveable lamps have a [[electrical connectors|plug]].  Light fixtures may also have other features, such as [[Mirror|reflector]]s for directing the light, an [[aperture]] (with or without a [[lens (optics)|lens]]), an outer shell or housing for lamp alignment and protection, and an [[electrical ballast]] or [[power supply]].  A wide variety of special light fixtures are created for use in the [[automotive lighting]] industry, [[aerospace]], marine and [[medicine]].\n\nPortable light fixtures are often called \"lamps\", as in '''table lamp''' or '''desk lamp'''.  In [[technical terminology]], the ''lamp'' is the light source, which is typically called the [[light bulb]].\n\nThe term ''luminaire'' is recommended by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) for technical use.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Behrens-aeg-werkstattleuchte.jpg|thumb|Industrial light fixture, designed by [[Peter Behrens]], around 1915]]\nFixture manufacturing began soon after production of the incandescent light bulb.  When practical uses of fluorescent lighting were realized after 1924, the three leading companies to produce various fixtures were [[Lightolier]], [[Artcraft Fluorescent Lighting Corporation]], and Globe Lighting in the United States.<ref>\"Early industry leaders\", of fluorescent fixture manufacturing, Paul Levy (1998)</ref>\n\n==Fixture types==\nLight fixtures are classified by how the fixture is installed, the light function or lamp type.\n\n===Free-standing or portable===\n[[File:Tiffany dragonfly lamp with pigeon sculptures.jpg|thumb|[[Tiffany lamp|Tiffany dragonfly desk lamp]] with pigeon sculptures]]\n* Table lamp fixtures, standard lamp fixtures, and office task light luminaires.\n** [[Balanced-arm lamp]] is a spot light with an adjustable arm such as [[anglepoise lamp|anglepoise]] or [[Luxo|Luxo L1]].\n** [[Gooseneck lamp]]\n** [[Nightlight]]\n* Floor Lamp\n** Torch lamp or [[torchiere|torchi\u00e8res]] are floor lamps with an upward facing shade. They provide general lighting to the rest of the room.\n** [[Gooseneck lamp]]\n*  Bouillotte lamp: see [[Bouillotte]]\n\n===Fixed===\n* Ceiling Dome \u2014 Also called the light source(s) are hidden behind a translucent dome typically made of glass, with some combination of frosting and surface texturing to diffuse the light. These can be flush mount fixtures which are mounted right up against the ceiling, or semi-flush fixtures which are separated by a small distance (usually about 3-12\"). \n** Open ceiling dome \u2014 the translucent dome is suspended a short distance below the ceiling by a mechanism that is hidden with the exception of a screw-knob or other device appearing on the outer dome face, and pulling this knob releases the dome\n** Enclosed ceiling dome  The translucent dome mates with a ring that is mounted flush with the ceiling\n* [[Recessed light]] \u2014 the protective housing is concealed behind a ceiling or wall, leaving only the fixture itself exposed. The ceiling-mounted version is often called a downlight.\n** \"Cans\" with a variety of lamps \u2014 this term is jargon for inexpensive [[downlighting]] products that are recessed into the ceiling, or sometimes for uplights placed on the floor.  The name comes from the shape of the housing.  The term \"pot lights\" is often used in Canada and parts of the US.\n** [[Cove light]] \u2014 recessed into the ceiling in a long box against a wall.\n** [[Troffer]] \u2014 recessed fluorescent light

fixture)|Sconce]] \u2014 provide up or down lights; can be used to illuminate artwork, architectural details; commonly used in [[hallway]]s or as an alternative to overhead lighting.\n** [[Track

cabinets\n** Display Case or Showcase light \u2014 shows merchandise on display within an enclosed case such as jewelry, grocery stores, and chain stores.\n** [[Ceiling fan]] - May sometimes have a light, often referred to as a light kit mounted to it.\n** [[Emergency lighting]] or [[exit sign]] \u2014 connected to a [[battery backup]] or to an electric circuit that has [[emergency power
