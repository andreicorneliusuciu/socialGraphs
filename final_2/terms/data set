The data set lists values for each of the variables, such as height and weight of an object, for each member of the data set.  Each value is known as a [[data|datum]]. The data set may comprise data for one or more members, corresponding to the number of rows.\n\nThe term data set may also be used more loosely, to refer to the data in a collection of closely related tables, corresponding to a particular experiment or event. An example of this type is the data sets collected by space agencies performing experiments with instruments aboard [[space probe]]s.\n\nIn the [[open data]] discipline, dataset is the unit to measure the information released in a public open data repository.  The European Open Data portal aggregates more than half a million datasets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.europeandataportal.eu/data/en/dataset|title=European open data portal|last=|first=|date=|website=European open data portal|publisher=European Commission|access-date=2016-09-23}}</ref> In this field other definitions have been proposed <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.meloda.org/dataset-definition/|title=Dataset definition \u2013 MELODA|website=www.meloda.org|access-date=2016-08-17}}</ref> but currently there is not an official one.

These include the number and types of the attributes or variables, and various [[statistical measure]]s applicable to them, such as [[standard deviation]] and [[kurtosis]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTzeRZFmaBgC&pg=PA100 |title=Principles of data mining and knowledge discovery |author=Jan M. \u017bytkow, Jan Rauch |postscript=<!--None--> |isbn=978-3-540-66490-1 |year=1999}}</ref>\n\nThe values may be numbers, such as [[real number]]s or [[integer]]s, for example representing a person's height in centimeters, but may also be [[nominal data]] (i.e., not consisting of [[Number|numerical]] values), for example representing a person's ethnicity. More generally, values may be of any of the kinds described as a [[level of measurement]]. For each variable, the values are normally all of the same kind. However, there may also be ''[[missing values]]'', which must be indicated in some way.\n\nIn [[statistics]], data sets usually come from actual observations obtained by [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] a [[statistical population]], and each row corresponds to the observations on one element of that population. Data sets may further be generated by [[algorithms]] for the purpose of testing certain kinds of [[software]].  Some modern statistical analysis software such as [[SPSS]] still present their data in the classical data set fashion.  If data is missing or suspicious an [[imputation (statistics)|imputation]] method may be used to complete a data set.<ref name=\"sde\">{{cite book |title=Statistical Data Editing: Impact on Data Quality: Volume 3 of Statistical Data Editing, Conference of European Statisticians Statistical standards and studies |author=United Nations Statistical Commission |author2=United Nations Economic Commission for Europe |year=2007 |publisher=United Nations Publications |isbn=9211169526 |page=20 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=X0wtLo2XY9gC |accessdate=19 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Classic data sets ==\nSeveral classic data sets have been used extensively in the [[statistical]] literature:\n\n* [[Iris flower data set]] \u2013 Multivariate data set introduced by [[Ronald Fisher]] (1936).<ref name=\"fisher36\">{{cite journal|author=Fisher, R.A. |title=The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems| journal=[[Annals of Eugenics]]| volume=7 |pages=179&ndash;188| year=1936| url=http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/coll/special//fisher/138.pdf | doi=10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x}}</ref>\n* [[MNIST database]] \u2013 Images of handwritten digits commonly used to test classification, clustering, and image processing algorithms\n* ''[[Categorical data analysis]]'' \u2013 Data sets used in the book, ''An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis''.\n*''[[Robust statistics]]'' \u2013 Data sets used in ''Robust Regression and Outlier Detection'' ([[Peter Rousseeuw|Rousseeuw]] and Leroy, 1986).
