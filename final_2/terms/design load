For example, a [[crane (machine)|crane]] with a design load of 20 tons is designed to be able to lift loads that weigh 20 tons or less. However, when a failure could be catastrophic, such as a crane dropping its load or collapsing entirely, a [[factor of safety]] is necessary. As a result, the crane should lift about 2 to 5 tons at the most. \n\nIn [[structural design]], a design load is greater than the load which the system is expected to support. This is because engineers incorporate a [[safety factor]] in their design, in order to ensure that the system will be able to support at least the expected loads (called [[specified loads]], despite any problems with construction, materials, etc. that go unnoticed during construction.\n\nA [[heater]] would have a general design load, meaning the maximum amount of heat it can produce. A bridge would have a specified load, with the design load being determined by engineers and applied as a theoretical load intended to ensure the actual real-world capacity of the specified load.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Limit states design]]\n*[[Factor of safety]]\n*[[Specified load]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Design Load}}\n[[Category:Engineering concepts]]"}]}}}}
