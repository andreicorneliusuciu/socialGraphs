Since the 1970s, the term has generally been assumed to refer to speeds of [[speed of sound|Mach]] 5 and above.\n\nThe precise [[Mach number]] at which a craft can be said to be flying at hypersonic speed varies, since individual physical changes in the airflow (like molecular [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] and [[ionization]]) occur at different speeds; these effects collectively become important around Mach 5. The hypersonic regime is often alternatively defined as speeds where [[ramjet]]s do not produce net [[thrust]].\n\n==Characteristics of flow==\nWhile the definition of hypersonic flow can be quite vague and is generally debatable (especially due to the lack of discontinuity between supersonic and hypersonic flows), a hypersonic flow may be characterized by certain physical phenomena that can no longer be analytically discounted as in supersonic flow. The peculiarity in hypersonic flows are as follows:\n# Shock layer\n# [[Aerodynamic heating]]\n# Entropy layer\n# Real gas effects\n# Low density effects\n# Independence of aerodynamic coefficients with Mach number.\n\n===Small shock stand-off distance===\nAs a body's Mach number increases, the density behind a [[Shock_wave#Bow_shocks | bow shock]] generated by the body also increases, which corresponds to a decrease in volume behind the shock due to [[conservation of mass]]. Consequently, the distance between the bow shock and the body decreases at higher Mach numbers.\n\n===Entropy layer===\nAs Mach numbers increase, the [[entropy]] change across the shock also increases, which results in a strong [[entropy gradient]] and highly [[vortical]] flow that mixes with the [[boundary layer]].\n\n===Viscous interaction===\nA portion of the large [[kinetic energy]] associated with flow at high Mach numbers transforms into [[internal energy]] in the fluid due to viscous effects. The increase in internal energy is realized as an increase in temperature. Since the pressure gradient normal to the flow within a boundary layer is approximately zero for low to moderate hypersonic Mach numbers, the increase of temperature through the boundary layer coincides with a decrease in density. This causes the bottom of the boundary layer to expand, so that the boundary layer over the body grows thicker and can often merge with the shock wave near the body leading edge.\n\n===High temperature flow===\nHigh temperatures due to a manifestation of viscous dissipation cause non-equilibrium chemical flow properties such as vibrational excitation and [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] and [[ionization]] of molecules resulting in [[convection|convective]] and [[Atmospheric reentry#Real (non-equilibrium) gas model|radiative heat-flux]].\n\n== Classification of Mach regimes ==\nAlthough \"subsonic\" and \"supersonic\" usually refer to speeds below and above the local [[speed of sound]] respectively, aerodynamicists often use these terms to refer to particular ranges of Mach values. This occurs because a \"[[transonic]] regime\" exists around M=1 where approximations of the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]] used for subsonic design no longer apply, partly because the flow locally exceeds M=1 even when the freestream Mach number is below this value.\n\nThe \"supersonic regime\" usually refers to the set of Mach numbers for which linearised theory may be used; for example, where the ([[air]]) flow is not chemically reacting and where [[heat transfer]] between air and vehicle may be reasonably neglected in calculations.\n\nGenerally, [[NASA]] defines \"high\" hypersonic as any Mach number from 10 to 25, and re-entry speeds as anything greater than Mach 25. Among the aircraft operating in this regime are the [[Space Shuttle]] and (theoretically) various developing [[spaceplane]]s.\n\nIn the following table, the \"regimes\" or \"ranges of Mach values\" are referenced instead of the usual meanings of \"subsonic\" and \"supersonic\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Modern [[combat aircraft]] must compromise in order to maintain low-speed handling; \"true\" supersonic designs include the [[F-104 Starfighter]] and BAC/A\u00e9rospatiale [[Concorde]].\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #FF4242;\" | Hypersonic\n| 5.0\u201310.0\n| 3,836\u20137,673\n| 6,174\u201312,348\n| 1,715\u20133,430\n| Cooled [[nickel]] or [[titanium]] skin; highly integrated (due to domination of interference effects: non-linear behaviour means that [[Superposition principle|superposition]] of results for separate components is invalid), small wings, see [[Boeing X-51|X-51A Waverider]], [[Hsiung Feng III]] and [[HyperSoar]].\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #FF0303;\" | High-hypersonic\n| 10.0\u201325.0\n| 7,673\u201319,182\n| 12,348\u201330,870\n| 3,430\u20138,575\n| Thermal control becomes a dominant design consideration. Structure must either be designed to operate hot, or be protected by special [[silicate]] tiles or similar. Chemically reacting flow can also cause corrosion of the vehicle's skin, with free-atomic [[oxygen]] featuring in very high-speed flows. Hypersonic designs are often forced into [[Atmospheric entry#Blunt body entry vehicles|blunt configurations]] because of the [[aerodynamic heating]] rising with a reduced [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]].\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #C00000;\" | Re-entry <br/>speeds\n| >25.0\n| >19,181.7\n| >30,869.95\n| >8,575\n| Ablative heat shield; small or no wings; blunt shape.\n|}\n\n==Similarity parameters==\nThe categorization of airflow relies on a number of [[Dimensionless numbers|similarity parameters]], which allow the simplification of a nearly infinite number of test cases into groups of similarity. For transonic and [[compressible flow]], the [[Mach number|Mach]] and [[Reynolds number]]s alone allow good categorization of many flow cases.\n\nHypersonic flows, however, require other similarity parameters. First, the [[analytic equation]]s for the [[shock wave|oblique shock angle]] become nearly independent of Mach number at high (~>10) Mach numbers. Second, the formation of strong shocks around aerodynamic bodies means that the freestream [[Reynolds number]] is less useful as an estimate of the behavior of the [[boundary layer]] over a body (although it is still important). Finally, the increased temperature of hypersonic flows mean that [[real gas]] effects become important. For this reason, research in hypersonics is often referred to as [[aerothermodynamics]], rather than [[aerodynamics]].\n\nThe introduction of real gas effects means that more variables are required to describe the full state of a gas. Whereas a stationary gas can be described by three variables ([[pressure]], [[temperature]], [[adiabatic index]]), and a moving gas by four ([[flow velocity]]), a hot gas in chemical equilibrium also requires state equations for the chemical components of the gas, and a gas in nonequilibrium solves those state equations using time as an extra variable. This means that for a nonequilibrium flow, something between 10 and 100 variables may be required to describe the state of the gas at any given time. Additionally, rarefied hypersonic flows (usually defined as those with a [[Knudsen number]] above 0.1) do not follow the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]].\n\nHypersonic flows are typically categorized by their total energy, expressed as total [[enthalpy]] (MJ/kg), total pressure (kPa-MPa), stagnation pressure (kPa-MPa), [[stagnation temperature]] (K), or flow velocity (km/s).\n\n[[Wallace D. Hayes]] developed a similarity parameter, similar to the [[area rule|Whitcomb area rule]], which allowed similar configurations to be compared.\n\n==Regimes==\nHypersonic flow can be approximately separated into a number of regimes. The selection of these regimes is rough, due to the blurring of the boundaries where a particular effect can be found.\n\n===Perfect gas===\nIn this regime, the gas can be regarded as an [[ideal gas]]. Flow in this regime is still Mach number dependent. Simulations start to depend on the use of a constant-temperature wall, rather than the adiabatic wall typically used at lower speeds. The lower border of this region is around Mach 5, where [[ramjet]]s become inefficient, and the upper border around Mach 10-12.\n\n===Two-temperature ideal gas===\nThis is a subset of the perfect gas regime, where the gas can be considered chemically perfect, but the rotational and vibrational temperatures of the gas must be considered separately, leading to two temperature models. See particularly the modeling of supersonic nozzles, where vibrational freezing becomes important.\n\n===Dissociated gas===\nIn this regime, diatomic or polyatomic gases (the gases found in most atmospheres) begin to [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] as they come into contact with the [[Shock wave|bow shock]] generated by the body. [[catalysis|Surface catalysis]] plays a role in the calculation of surface heating, meaning that the type of surface material also has an effect on the flow. The lower border of this regime is where any component of a gas mixture first begins to dissociate in the stagnation point of a flow (which for nitrogen is around 2000 K). At the upper border of this regime, the effects of [[ionization]] start to have an effect on the flow.\n\n===Ionized gas===\nIn this regime the [[ionization|ionized]] electron population of the stagnated flow becomes significant, and the electrons must be modeled separately. Often the electron temperature is handled separately from the temperature of the remaining gas components. This region occurs for freestream flow velocities around 10\u201312&nbsp;km/s. Gases in this region are modeled as non-radiating [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]].\n\n===Radiation-dominated regime===\nAbove around 12&nbsp;km/s, the heat transfer to a vehicle changes from being conductively dominated to radiatively dominated. The modeling of gases in this regime is split into two classes:\n#[[Optical depth|Optically thin]]: where the gas does not re-absorb radiation emitted from other parts of the gas\n#Optically thick: where the radiation must be considered a separate source of energy.\nThe modeling of optically thick gases is extremely difficult, since, due to the calculation of the radiation at each point, the computation load theoretically expands exponentially as the number of points considered increases.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Supersonic transport]]\n*[[Lifting body]]\n*[[Atmospheric entry]]\n*[[Hypersonic flight]]\n*[[DARPA Falcon Project]]\n*[[Reaction Engines Skylon]], [[Reaction Engines A2]] (design studies)\n*[[HyperSoar]] (concept)\n*[[WaveRider|X-51 A Waverider]]\n*[[X-20 Dyna-Soar]], [[Rockwell X-30]] (cancelled)\n*[[Avatar (spacecraft)|Avatar RLV]]\n*[[Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle]]\n*[[Ayaks]]\n*[[WU-14]]\n*[[Lockheed Martin SR-72]] (Planned)\n\n;Engines\n*[[Rocket engine]]\n*[[Scramjet]]\n*[[Reaction Engines SABRE]], [[LAPCAT]] (design studies)\n\n;Missiles\n*[[Hsiung Feng III|Hsiung Feng III Hypersonic Nuclear Missile]] - {{flagicon|Taiwan}} [[Taiwan]] (Currently In Service)\n*[[WU-14|WU-14 Hypersonic Glide Vehicle]] - {{flagicon|China}} [[China]] (Under Development)\n*[[Shaurya (missile)]] Ballistic Missile - {{flagicon|India}} [[India]] (Entered Production)\n*[[BrahMos-II]] Cruise Missile - {{flagicon|India}} [[India]] (Under Development)\n*[[9K720 Iskander]] Short-range ballistic missile {{flagicon|Russia}} [[Russia]] (Currently In Service)\n\n;Other flow regimes\n* [[Subsonic flight]]\n* [[Transonic]]\n* [[Supersonic speed]]\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last=Anderson|first=John|year=2006|title=Hypersonic and High-Temperature Gas Dynamics Second Edition|publisher=AIAA Education Series|isbn=1-56347-780-7}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Hypersonics}}\n*[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/BGH/index.html NASA's Guide to Hypersonics]\n*[http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/hypersonics Hypersonics Group at Imperial College]\n*[http://www.mech.uq.edu.au/hyper/ University of Queensland Centre for Hypersonics]\n*[http://seit.unsw.adfa.edu.au/research/activity.php?activity_id=42 High Speed Flow Group at University of New South Wales]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hypersonic Speed}}\n[[Category:Aerodynamics]]\n[[Category:Aerospace engineering]]\n[[Category:Airspeed]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft propulsion]]"}]}}}}
