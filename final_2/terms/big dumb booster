As used here, it refers to the criterion of designing launch systems for minimum cost by using simplified subsystems where appropriate.<ref>''Big Dumb Boosters: A Low-Cost Space Transportation Option?''

It is a process of making trade analyses to understand the cost versus mass implications.  It is not a specific design choice like pressure-fed engines or single engine per stage.  The process shows how to reduce costs by allowing mass to increase where there is a favorable impact on life-cycle cost.  Some of the early design concepts were referred to as big dumb boosters, not necessarily in a favorable manner.<ref name=\"mcd\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pressure-fed engine (rocket)]]\n*[[Beal Aerospace]]\n*[[Sea Dragon (rocket)]]\n*[[OTRAG (rocket)]] a BDB with massively parallel boosters\n\n== References and notes ==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n{{refend}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Spacecraft propulsion]]"}]}}}}
