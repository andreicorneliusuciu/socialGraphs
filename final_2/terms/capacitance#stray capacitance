There are two closely related notions of capacitance: ''self capacitance'' and ''mutual capacitance'', that are usually both designated by the same term ''capacitance''. A material with a large self capacitance holds more [[electric charge]] at a given [[voltage]], than one with low capacitance. Any object that can be electrically charged exhibits self capacitance. The notion of mutual capacitance is particularly important for understanding the operations of the [[capacitor]], one of the three fundamental electronic components (along with [[resistors]] and [[inductors]]).\n\nThe capacitance is a function only of the geometry of the design (e.g. area of the plates and the distance between them) and the [[permittivity]] of the [[dielectric]] material between the plates of the capacitor. For many dielectric materials, the permittivity and thus the capacitance, is independent of the potential difference between the conductors and the total charge on them.\n\nThe [[SI]] unit of capacitance is the [[farad]] (symbol: F), named after the English physicist [[Michael Faraday]]. A 1 farad capacitor, when charged with 1 [[coulomb]] of electrical charge, has a potential difference of 1 [[volt]] between its plates.<ref>http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/farad</ref>\n\n==Self-capacitance==\nIn electrical circuits, the term ''capacitance'' is usually a shorthand for the ''[[mutual capacitance]]'' between two adjacent conductors, such as the two plates of a capacitor. However, for an isolated conductor there also exists a property called ''self-capacitance'', which is the amount of electric charge that must be added to an isolated conductor to raise its [[electric potential]] by one unit (i.e. one volt, in most measurement systems).<ref>{{cite book|author=William D.

It is actually [[mutual capacitance]] between the individual turns of the coil and is a form of stray, or [[parasitic capacitance]].  This self-capacitance is an important consideration at high frequencies.  It changes the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the coil and gives rise to parallel [[Electrical resonance|resonance]].  In many applications this is an undesirable effect and sets an upper frequency limit for the correct operation of the circuit.\n\n==Mutual capacitance==\n\nA common form is a parallel-plate [[capacitor]], which consists of two conductive plates insulated from each other, usually sandwiching a [[dielectric]] material. In a parallel plate capacitor, capacitance is very nearly proportional to the surface area of the conductor plates and inversely proportional to the separation distance between the plates.\n\nIf the charges on the plates are +''q'' and \u2212''q'', and ''V'' gives the [[voltage]] between the plates, then the capacitance ''C'' is given by\n\n:<math>C = \\frac{q}{V}.</math>\nwhich gives the voltage/[[electric current|current]] relationship\n:<math>I(t) = C \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}.</math>\n\nHistorically, a farad was regarded as an inconveniently large unit, both electrically and physically. Its subdivisions were invariably used, namely the microfarad, nanofarad and picofarad.  More recently, technology has advanced such that capacitors of 1 farad and greater (so-called '[[Electric double-layer capacitor|supercapacitors]]') can be constructed in a structure little larger than a [[coin battery]].  Such capacitors are principally used for energy storage replacing more traditional batteries.\n\nThe energy stored in a capacitor is found by [[integral|integrating]] the work ''W'':\n\n:<math> W_\\text{charging} = \\frac{1}{2}CV^2</math>\n\n===Capacitance matrix===\n\nThe discussion above is limited to the case of two conducting plates, although of arbitrary size and shape.\nThe definition\n<math>C = Q/V</math> does not apply when there are more than two charged plates, or when the net charge on the two plates is non-zero. To handle this case, Maxwell introduced his ''[[coefficients of potential]]''. If three plates are given charges <math>Q_1, Q_2, Q_3</math>, then the voltage of plate 1 is given by\n\n:<math>V_1 = P_{11}Q_1 + P_{12} Q_2 + P_{13}Q_3, </math>\n\nand similarly for the other voltages. [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[Sir William Thomson]] showed that the coefficients of potential are symmetric, so that <math>P_{12}=P_{21}</math>, etc. Thus the system can be described by a collection of coefficients known as the ''elastance matrix'' or ''reciprocal capacitance matrix'', which is defined as:\n\n:<math>P_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial V_{i}}{\\partial Q_{j}}</math>\n\nFrom this, the mutual capacitance <math>C_{m}</math> between two objects can be defined<ref name=Jackson1999>{{citation|last=Jackson|first=John David|title=Classical Electrodynamic|publisher = John Wiley & Sons, Inc. |year=1999|location=USA|edition=3rd.|page=43|isbn=978-0-471-30932-1}}</ref> by solving for the total charge ''Q'' and using <math>C_{m}=Q/V</math>.\n\n: <math>C_m = \\frac{1}{(P_{11} + P_{22})-(P_{12} + P_{21})}</math>\n\nSince no actual device holds perfectly equal and opposite charges on each of the two \"plates\", it is the mutual capacitance that is reported on capacitors.\n\nThe collection of coefficients <math>C_{ij} =\\frac{\\partial Q_{i}}{\\partial V_{j}}</math> is known as the ''capacitance matrix'',<ref name=maxwell>{{Citation | last =Maxwell | first =James | author-link =James Clerk Maxwell | title = A treatise on electricity and magnetism, Volume 1 | publisher = Clarendon Press | year = 1873 | chapter =3 | pages =88ff | url = https://archive.org/details/electricandmagne01maxwrich}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Capacitance|url=http://www.av8n.com/physics/capacitance.htm|accessdate=20 September 2010}}</ref> and is the [[matrix inverse|inverse]] of the elastance matrix.\n\n==Capacitors==\n{{Main article|Capacitor}}\nThe capacitance of the majority of capacitors used in electronic circuits is generally several orders of magnitude smaller than the [[farad]]. The most common subunits of capacitance in use today are the [[micro-|micro]]farad (\u00b5F), [[nano-|nano]]farad (nF), [[pico-|pico]]farad (pF), and, in microcircuits, [[femto-|femto]]farad (fF). However, specially made [[supercapacitors]] can be much larger (as much as hundreds of farads), and parasitic capacitive elements can be less than a femtofarad.  In the past, alternate subunits were used in historical electronic books; \"mfd\" and \"mf\" for microfarad (\u00b5F); \"mmfd\", \"mmf\", \"\u00b5\u00b5F\" for picofarad (pF); but are rarely used any more.<ref>[http://www.justradios.com/MFMMFD.html Capacitor MF-MMFD Conversion Chart; Just Radios.]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/FundamentalsOfElectronics93400A1b Fundamentals of Electronics - Volume 1b - Basic Electricity - Alternating Current; Bureau of Naval Personnel; 1965; page 197.]</ref>\n\nCapacitance can be calculated if the geometry of the conductors and the dielectric properties of the insulator between the conductors are known. A qualitative explanation for this can be given as follows.<br> Once a positive charge is put unto a conductor, this charge creates an electrical field, repelling any other positive charge to be moved onto the conductor; i.e., increasing the necessary voltage. But if nearby there is another conductor with a negative charge on it, the electrical field of the positive conductor repelling the second positive charge is weakened (the second positive charge also feels the attracting force of the negative charge). So due to the second conductor with a negative charge, it becomes easier to put a positive charge on the already positive charged first conductor, and vice versa; i.e., the necessary voltage is lowered. <br> As a quantitative example consider the capacitance of a capacitor constructed of two parallel plates both of area ''A'' separated by a distance ''d''. If ''d'' is sufficiently small with respect to the smallest chord of ''A'', there holds, to a high level of accuracy:\n:<math>\\ C=\\varepsilon_r\\varepsilon_0\\frac{A}{d}</math>\nwhere\n:''C'' is the capacitance, in farads;\n:''A'' is the area of overlap of the two plates, in square meters;\n:''\u03b5''<sub>r</sub> is the [[relative static permittivity]] (sometimes called the dielectric constant) of the material between the plates (for a vacuum, {{nowrap|''\u03b5''<sub>r</sub> {{=}} 1}});\n:''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub> is the [[vacuum permittivity|electric constant]] (''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;\u2248 {{val|8.854|e=-12|u=F.m-1}}); and\n:''d'' is the separation between the plates, in meters;\n\nCapacitance is proportional to the area of overlap and inversely proportional to the separation between conducting sheets. The closer the sheets are to each other, the greater the capacitance.\nThe equation is a good approximation if ''d'' is small compared to the other dimensions of the plates so that the electric field in the capacitor area is uniform, and the so-called ''fringing field'' around the periphery provides only a small contribution to the capacitance. In [[Gaussian units|CGS units]] the equation has the form:<ref>''The Physics Problem Solver'', 1986, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KVM2onr8_QYC&pg=PA648 Google books link]</ref>\n:<math>C=\\varepsilon_r\\frac{A}{4\\pi d}</math>\nwhere ''C'' in this case has the units of length.\nCombining the SI equation for capacitance with the above equation for the energy stored in a capacitance, for a flat-plate capacitor the energy stored is:\n\n:<math> W_\\text{stored} = \\frac{1}{2} C V^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\varepsilon_{r}\\varepsilon_{0} \\frac{A}{d} V^2.</math>\n\nwhere ''W'' is the energy, in joules; ''C'' is the capacitance, in farads; and ''V'' is the voltage, in volts.\n\n==Stray capacitance==\n{{Main article|Parasitic capacitance}}\nAny two adjacent conductors can function as a capacitor, though the capacitance is small unless the conductors are close together for long distances or over a large area.  This (often unwanted) capacitance is called parasitic or \"stray capacitance\". Stray capacitance can allow signals to leak between otherwise isolated circuits (an effect called [[Crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]]), and it can be a limiting factor for proper functioning of circuits at [[high frequency]].\n\nStray capacitance between the input and output in amplifier circuits can be troublesome because it can form a path for [[Feedback#Electronic engineering|feedback]], which can cause instability and [[parasitic oscillation]] in the amplifier. It is often convenient for analytical purposes to replace this capacitance with a combination of one input-to-ground capacitance and one output-to-ground capacitance; the original configuration \u2014 including the input-to-output capacitance \u2014 is often referred to as a pi-configuration. Miller's theorem can be used to effect this replacement: it states that, if the gain ratio of two nodes is 1/''K'', then an [[electrical impedance|impedance]] of ''Z'' connecting the two nodes can be replaced with a ''Z''/(1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k'') impedance between the first node and ground and a ''KZ''/(''K''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1) impedance between the second node and ground. Since impedance varies inversely with capacitance, the internode capacitance, ''C'', is replaced by a capacitance of KC from input to ground and a capacitance of (''K''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)''C''/''K'' from output to ground. When the input-to-output gain is very large, the equivalent input-to-ground impedance is very small while the output-to-ground impedance is essentially equal to the original (input-to-output) impedance.\n\n==Capacitance of simple systems==\nCalculating the capacitance of a system amounts to solving the [[Laplace equation]] ''\u2207<sup>2</sup>\u03c6&nbsp;=&nbsp;0'' with a constant potential ''\u03c6'' on the surface of the conductors. This is trivial in cases with high symmetry. There is no solution in terms of elementary functions in more complicated cases.\n\nFor quasi-two-dimensional situations analytic functions may be used to map different geometries to each other.

Consider a capacitor of capacitance ''C'', holding a charge +''q'' on one plate and \u2212''q'' on the other. Moving a small element of charge d''q'' from one plate to the other against the potential difference {{nowrap|''V'' {{=}} ''q/C''}} requires the work d''W'':\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{d}W = \\frac{q}{C}\\,\\mathrm{d}q </math>\n\nwhere ''W'' is the work measured in joules, ''q'' is the charge measured in coulombs and ''C'' is the capacitance, measured in farads.\n\nThe energy stored in a capacitor is found by [[integral|integrating]] this equation. Starting with an uncharged capacitance ({{nowrap|''q'' {{=}} 0}}) and moving charge from one plate to the other until the plates have charge +''Q'' and \u2212''Q'' requires the work ''W'':\n\n:<math> W_\\text{charging} = \\int_0^Q \\frac{q}{C} \\, \\mathrm{d}q = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{Q^2}{C} = \\frac{1}{2}QV = \\frac{1}{2}CV^2 = W_\\text{stored}.</math>\n\n==Capacitance of nanoscale systems==\nThe capacitance of nanoscale dielectric capacitors such as [[quantum dots]] may differ from conventional formulations of larger capacitors. In particular, the electrostatic potential difference experienced by electrons in conventional capacitors is spatially well-defined and fixed by the shape and size of metallic electrodes in addition to the statistically large number of electrons present in conventional capacitors. In nanoscale capacitors, however, the electrostatic potentials experienced by electrons are determined by the number and locations of all electrons that contribute to the electronic properties of the device. In such devices, the number of electrons may be very small, however, the resulting spatial distribution of equipotential surfaces within the device are exceedingly complex.\n\n===Single-electron devices===\nThe capacitance of a connected, or \"closed\", single-electron device is twice the capacitance of an unconnected, or \"open\", single-electron device.<ref name= Tsu>\n{{Cite book\n |pages=312\u2013315 \n |title=Superlattice to Nanoelectronics \n |isbn=978-0-08-096813-1 \n |author=Raphael Tsu\n |publisher=Elsevier\n |year=2011\n}}</ref> This fact may be traced more fundamentally to the energy stored in the single-electron device whose \"direct polarization\" interaction energy may be equally divided into the interaction of the electron with the polarized charge on the device itself due to the presence of the electron and the amount of potential energy required to form the polarized charge on the device (the interaction of charges in the device's dielectric material with the potential due to the electron).<ref name= LaFave-DCD>\n{{Cite journal\n |author=T.

In nanoscale devices, [[nanowires]] consisting of metal atoms typically do not exhibit the same conductive properties as their macroscopic, or bulk material, counterparts.\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|3}}\n*[[Amp\u00e8re's law]]\n*[[Capacitor]]\n*[[Capacitive Displacement Sensors]]\n*[[Electrical conductance|Conductance]]\n*[[Electrical conductor|Conductor]]\n*[[Displacement current]]\n*[[Electromagnetism]]\n*[[Electricity]]\n*[[Electronics]]\n*[[Gauss law]]\n*[[Hydraulic analogy]]\n*[[Inductor]]\n*[[Inductance]]\n*[[Orders of magnitude (capacitance)]]\n*[[Quantum capacitance]]\n*[[LCR meter]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*Tipler, Paul (1998).
