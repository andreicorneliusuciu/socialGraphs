It is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] that has the units of [[speed]]. As used in this context, it is ''not'' the same as the [[delta-v (physics)|physical change in velocity]] of the vehicle.\n\nDelta-''v'' is produced by reaction engines, such as [[rocket engine]]s, and is proportional to the [[thrust]] per unit mass, and burn time, and is used to determine the mass  of [[rocket propellant|propellant]] required for the given maneuver through the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]].\n\nFor multiple maneuvers, delta-''v'' sums linearly.\n\nFor interplanetary missions delta-''v'' is often plotted on a [[porkchop plot]] which displays the required mission delta-''v'' as a function of launch date.\n\n==Definition==\n\n:<math>\\Delta{v} = \\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \\frac{|T(t)|}{m(t)}\\, dt</math>\n\nwhere\n:''T''(t) is the instantaneous [[thrust]] at time, t,\n:''m''(t) is the instantaneous [[mass]] at time, t.\n\n==Specific cases==\nIn the absence of external forces:\n: <math>\\Delta{v} = \\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \\left|\\dot{v}\\right|\\, dt</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\dot{v}</math> is the coordinate acceleration.\n\nWhen thrust is applied in a constant direction ({{sfrac|v|{{!}}v{{!}}}} is constant) this simplifies to:\n: <math>\\Delta{v} = | v_1 - v_0 |</math>\n\nwhich is simply the magnitude of the [[Delta-v (physics)|change in velocity]]. However, this relation does not hold in the general case: if, for instance, a constant, unidirectional acceleration is reversed after (''t''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''t''<sub>0</sub>)/2 then the velocity difference is 0, but delta-''v'' is the same as for the non-reversed thrust.\n\nFor rockets the 'absence of external forces' is taken to mean the absence of gravity, atmospheric drag as well as the absence of aerostatic back pressure on the nozzle and hence the [[vacuum Isp|vacuum I<sub>sp</sub>]] is used for calculating the vehicle's delta-''v'' capacity via the [[rocket equation]], and the costs for the atmospheric losses are rolled into the [[delta-v budget|delta-''v'' budget]] when dealing with launches from a planetary surface.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n==Orbital maneuvers==\n{{main article|rocket equation}}\nOrbit maneuvers are made by firing a [[Rocket engine|thruster]] to produce a reaction force acting on the spacecraft.

Like this one can for example use a \"patched conics\" approach modeling the maneuver as a shift from one [[Kepler orbit]] to another by an instantaneous change of the velocity vector.\n\n[[File:Impulsive maneuver.svg|thumb|Figure 1:Approximation of a finite thrust maneuver with an impulsive change in velocity having the delta-''v'' given by ({{EquationNote|4}})]]\nThis approximation with impulsive maneuvers is in most cases very accurate, at least when chemical propulsion is used.  For low thrust systems, typically [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electrical propulsion]] systems, this approximation is less accurate. But even for geostationary spacecraft using electrical propulsion for out-of-plane control with thruster burn periods extending over several hours around the nodes this approximation is fair.\n\n==Producing delta-''v''==\n\nDelta-''v'' is typically provided by the [[thrust]] of a [[rocket engine]], but can be created by other engines. The time-rate of change of delta-''v'' is the magnitude of the acceleration ''caused by the engines'', i.e., the thrust per total vehicle mass. The actual acceleration vector would be found by adding thrust per mass on to the gravity vector and the vectors representing any other forces acting on the object.\n\nThe total delta-''v'' needed is a good starting point for early design decisions since consideration of the added complexities are deferred to later times in the design process.\n\nThe rocket equation shows that the required amount of propellant dramatically increases with increasing delta-''v''. Therefore, in modern [[spacecraft propulsion]] systems considerable study is put into reducing the total delta-''v'' needed for a given spaceflight, as well as designing spacecraft that are capable of producing larger delta-''v''.\n\nIncreasing the delta-''v'' provided by a propulsion system can be achieved by:\n*[[staging (rocketry)|staging]]\n*increasing [[specific impulse]]\n*improving [[propellant mass fraction]]\n\n==Multiple maneuvers==\nBecause the mass ratios apply to any given burn, when multiple maneuvers are performed in sequence, the mass ratios multiply.\n\nThus it can be shown that, provided the exhaust velocity is fixed, this means that delta-''v''\u2019s can be added:\n\nWhen m{{sub|1}}, m{{sub|2}} are the mass ratios of the maneuvers, and v1, v2 are the delta-''v''\u2019s of the first and second maneuvers\n\n<math>\\begin{align}\n  m_1 m_2 &= e^\\frac{V_1}{V_e} e^\\frac{V_2}{V_e} \\\\\n                        &= e^\\frac{V_1 + V_2}{V_e} \\\\\n                        &= e^\\frac{V}{V_e} = M\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nWhere V = v{{sub|1}} + v{{sub|2}} and M = m{{sub|1}} M{{sub|2}}.\n\nWhich is just the rocket equation applied to the sum of the two maneuvers.\n\nThis is convenient since it means that delta-''v''\u2019s can be calculated and simply added and the mass ratio calculated only for the overall vehicle for the entire mission. Thus delta-''v'' is commonly quoted rather than mass ratios which would require multiplication.\n\n==Delta-''v'' budgets==\n{{main article|delta-v budget}}\nWhen designing a trajectory, delta-''v'' budget is used as a good indicator of how much propellant will be required. Propellant usage is an exponential function of delta-''v'' in accordance with the [[rocket equation]], it will also depend on the exhaust velocity.\n\nIt is not possible to determine delta-''v'' requirements from [[conservation of energy]] by considering only the total energy of the vehicle in the initial and final orbits since energy is carried away in the exhaust (see also below). For example, most spacecraft are launched in an orbit with inclination fairly near to the latitude at the launch site, to take advantage of the Earth's rotational surface speed. If it is necessary, for mission-based reasons, to put the spacecraft in an orbit of different [[inclination]], a substantial delta-''v'' is required, though the [[specific kinetic energy|specific kinetic]] and potential energies in the final orbit and the initial orbit are equal.\n\nWhen rocket thrust is applied in short bursts the other sources of acceleration may be negligible, and the magnitude of the velocity change of one burst may be simply approximated by the delta-''v''. The total delta-''v'' to be applied can then simply be found by addition of each of the delta-''v''\u2019s needed at the discrete burns, even though between bursts the magnitude and direction of the velocity changes due to gravity, e.g. in an [[elliptic orbit]].\n\nFor examples of calculating delta-''v'', see [[Hohmann transfer orbit]], [[gravitational slingshot]], and [[Interplanetary Transport Network]]. It is also notable that large thrust can reduce [[gravity drag]].\n\nDelta-''v'' is also required to keep satellites in orbit and is expended in propulsive [[orbital stationkeeping]] maneuvers. Since the propellant load on most satellites cannot be replenished, the amount of propellant initially loaded on a satellite may well determine its useful lifetime.\n\n===Oberth effect===\n{{main article|Oberth effect}}\nFrom power considerations, it turns out that when applying delta-''v'' in the direction of the velocity the [[specific orbital energy]] gained per unit delta-''v'' is equal to the instantaneous speed. This is called the Oberth effect.\n\nFor example, a satellite in an elliptical orbit is boosted more efficiently at high speed (that is, small altitude) than at low speed (that is, high altitude).\n\nAnother example is that when a vehicle is making a pass of a planet, burning the propellant at closest approach rather than further out gives significantly higher final speed, and this is even more so when the planet is a large one with a deep gravity field, such as Jupiter.\n\nSee also [[Gravitational slingshot#Powered slingshots|powered slingshots]].\n\n===Porkchop plot===\n{{main article|Porkchop plot}}\nDue to the relative positions of planets changing over time, different delta-vs are required at different launch dates. A diagram that shows the required delta-''v'' plotted against time is sometimes called a ''porkchop plot''. Such a diagram is useful since it enables calculation of a [[launch window]], since launch should only occur when the mission is within the capabilities of the vehicle to be employed.<ref>[http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/spotlight/porkchopAll.html Mars Exploration: Features<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Delta-''v''s around the Solar System<ref name=marsdeltavs>{{cite web|title=Rockets and Space Transportation |url=http://www.pma.caltech.edu/~chirata/deltav.html |accessdate=June 1, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701211813/http://www.pma.caltech.edu/~chirata/deltav.html |archivedate=July 1, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Delta-V Calculator|url=http://www.strout.net/info/science/delta-v/intro.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000312041150/http://www.strout.net/info/science/delta-v/intro.html|archivedate=Mar 12, 2000|deadurl=no}} Gives figures of 8.6 from Earth's surface to LEO, 4.1 and 3.8 for LEO to lunar orbit (or L5) and GEO resp., 0.7 for L5 to lunar orbit, and 2.2 for lunar orbit to lunar surface.

Lower-delta-v transfers than shown can often be achieved, but involve rare transfer windows or take significantly longer, see: [[orbital mechanics#Interplanetary Transport Network and fuzzy orbits|fuzzy orbital transfers]]. The figure 2.5 for LEO to GTO is higher than necessary<ref>The sum of LEO to GTO and GTO to GEO should equal LEO to GEO. The precise figures depend on what low earth orbit is used. According to [[Geostationary transfer orbit]], the speed of a GTO at perigee can be just 9.8 km/s. This corresponds to an LEO at about 700 km altitude, where its speed would be 7.5 km/s, giving a delta-v of 2.3 km/s. Starting from a lower LEO would require more delta-v to get to GTO, but then the total for LEO to GEO would have to be higher.</ref> and the figure of 30 for LEO to the sun is also too high.<ref>The speed of the earth going around the sun is 29.78 km/s, equivalent to a specific kinetic energy of 443 km<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>. One must add to this the potential energy depth of LEO, about 61 km<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>, to give a kinetic energy close to Earth of 504 km<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to a speed of 31.8 km/s. Since the LEO speed is 7.8 km/s, the delta-v is only 24 km/s. It would be possible to reach the sun with less delta-v using [[gravity assist]]s.
