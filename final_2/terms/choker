Chokers can be made of a variety of materials, including [[velvet]], plastic, [[bead]]s, [[leather]], [[metal]], such as silver, gold or platinum, etc. They can be adorned in a variety of ways, including with [[sequin]]s, [[wikt:stud#Etymology 2|studs]], or a [[pendant]].\n\nThe common type of chokers include Victorian, vintage, open collar, Gothic, pendant, gemstones, or tattoo.\n\nHistorically, it was associated with [[high fashion]], but could take on different meanings under different circumstances. [[Ballerinas]] and the upper class in the late 19th century commonly wore certain types of chokers. However, at that same time, a plain, thin, red or black ribbon choker had ties to [[prostitution]] in the late 19th century, as seen in [[\u00c9douard Manet|Manet]]'s ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'' (1861), while a plain black woven choker or ribbon could signify secret [[lesbian]]ism in the [[Depression era]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Aldrich|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Aldrich (historian)|title=Gay Life & Culture: A World History|year=2006|pages=212}}</ref>\n\nThe 19th century fashion for broad Chokers reached its peak around 1900 in part due to Queen [[Alexandra of Denmark]] wearing one to hide a small scar.<ref name=Phillips156>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Clare |date=1996 |title=Jewelry from Antiquity to the Present|publisher=Thames and Hudson |page=156 |isbn=0500202877}}</ref>  Chokers were trendy into the 1920s and again in the \u201840s as \u201ccolliers de chien.\u201d<ref>{{cite news|last1=Garber|first1=Megan|title=The Long (and Short) History of the Choker|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/10/neck-and-neck-the-long-and-short-history-of-the-choker/503315/|accessdate=10 October 2016|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=10 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nChokers became quite popular among women and girls in the 1970s and late 1990s.
