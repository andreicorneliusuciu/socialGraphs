In the sense of the \"art of the general\", which included several subsets of skills including \"tactics\", siegecraft, logistics etc., the term came into use in the 6th century C.E. in East Roman terminology, and was translated into Western vernacular languages only in the 18th century.  From then until the 20th century, the word \"strategy\" came to denote \"a comprehensive way to try to pursue political ends, including the threat or actual use of force, in a dialectic of wills\" in a military conflict, in which both adversaries interact.<ref name=\"LFreedman2013\">{{cite book\n| last = Freedman\n| first = Lawrence\n| year = 2013\n| title = Strategy | publisher = Oxford University Press\n| isbn = 978-0-19-932515-3}}</ref>\n\nStrategy is important because the resources available to achieve these goals are usually limited. Strategy generally involves setting goals, determining actions to achieve the goals, and mobilizing resources to execute the actions. A strategy describes how the ends (goals) will be achieved by the means (resources). This is generally tasked with determining strategy.  Strategy can be intended or can emerge as a pattern of activity as the organization adapts to its environment or competes. It involves activities such as [[strategic planning]] and [[strategic thinking]].<ref name=\"Mintzberg and Quinn 1996\">{{cite book\n| last = Mintzberg, Henry and\n| first = Quinn, James Brian\n| year = 1996\n| title = The Strategy Process: Concepts, Contexts, Cases | publisher = Prentice Hall\n| isbn = 978-0-132-340304}}</ref>\n\n[[Henry Mintzberg]] from [[McGill University]] defined strategy as \"a pattern in a stream of decisions\" to contrast with a view of strategy as planning,<ref name=charlesw>{{cite journal|url=http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charlesw/LongStrat2010/papers/class%2010/Patterns%20of%20Strategy%20Formulation.pdf |title=Patterns in Strategy Formation |author=Henry Mintzberg |journal=Management Science |publisher=INFORMS |volume=24 |number=9 |date=May 1978 |pages=934\u2013948 |accessdate=31 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019210811/http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charlesw/LongStrat2010/papers/class%2010/Patterns%20of%20Strategy%20Formulation.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2013 |doi=10.1287/mnsc.24.9.934}}</ref> while [[Max McKeown]] (2011) argues that \"strategy is about shaping the future\" and is the human attempt to get to \"desirable ends with available means\".

Rumelt described strategy as a type of problem solving in 2011. He wrote that good strategy has an underlying structure he called a ''kernel''.  The kernel has three parts: 1) A ''diagnosis'' that defines or explains the nature of the challenge; 2) A ''guiding policy'' for dealing with the challenge; and 3) Coherent ''actions'' designed to carry out the guiding policy.<ref name=\"Rumelt2011\">{{cite book\n| last = Rumelt\n| first = Richard P.\n| year = 2011\n| title = Good Strategy/Bad Strategy | publisher = Crown Business\n| isbn = 978-0-307-88623-1}}</ref>\nPresident [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] illustrated these three elements of strategy in his [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] Address to the Nation of 22 October 1962: \n#Diagnosis:  \"This Government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military buildup on the island of Cuba. Within the past week, unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites are now in preparation on that imprisoned island. The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere.\"\n#Guiding Policy: \"Our unswerving objective, therefore, must be to prevent the use of these missiles against this or any other country, and to secure their withdrawal or elimination from the Western Hemisphere.\"\n#Action Plans:  First among seven numbered steps was the following: \"To halt this offensive buildup a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation or port will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkcubanmissilecrisis.html|title=American Rhetoric: John F. Kennedy - Cuban Missile Crisis Address to    the Nation|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nRumelt wrote in 2011 that three important aspects of strategy include \"premeditation, the anticipation of others' behavior, and the purposeful design of coordinated actions.\" He described strategy as solving a design problem, with trade-offs among various elements that must be arranged, adjusted and coordinated, rather than a plan or choice.<ref name=\"Rumelt2011\"/>\n\n==Formulating and implementing strategy==\nStrategy typically involves two major processes: ''formulation'' and ''implementation''. ''Formulation'' involves analyzing the environment or situation, making a diagnosis, and developing guiding policies. It includes such activities as [[strategic planning]] and [[strategic thinking]]. ''Implementation'' refers to the action plans taken to achieve the goals established by the guiding policy.<ref name=\"Mintzberg and Quinn 1996\"/><ref name=\"Rumelt2011\"/>\n\n[[Bruce Henderson]] wrote in 1981 that: \"Strategy depends upon the ability to foresee future consequences of present initiatives.\"  He wrote that the basic requirements for strategy development include, among other factors: 1) extensive knowledge about the environment, market and competitors; \n2) ability to examine this knowledge as an interactive dynamic system; and \n3) the imagination and logic to choose between specific alternatives. Henderson wrote that strategy was valuable because of: \"finite resources, uncertainty about an adversary's capability and intentions; the irreversible commitment of resources; necessity of coordinating action over time and distance; uncertainty about control of the initiative; and the nature of adversaries' mutual perceptions of each other.\"<ref>{{cite web| author = Henderson, Bruce | date = 1 January 1981 | title=The Concept of Strategy|url=https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/Classics/strategy_concept_of_strategy/|accessdate= 18 April 2014|publisher= [[Boston Consulting Group]]}}</ref>\n\n==Military theory==\n{{main article|Military strategy}}\n{{quote box|width = 200px|quote=Subordinating the political point of view to the military would be absurd, for it is policy that has created war...Policy is the guiding intelligence, and war only the instrument, not vice-versa.|source=[[On War]] by [[Carl von Clausewitz]]}}\n\nIn military theory, strategy is \"the utilization during both peace and war, of all of the nation's forces, through large scale, long-range planning and development, to ensure security and victory\" (''Random House Dictionary'').<ref name=charlesw/>\n\nThe father of Western modern [[Strategic studies|strategic study]], [[Carl von Clausewitz]], defined military strategy as \"the employment of battles to gain the end of war.\" [[B.

Where the realized pattern was different from the intent, he referred to the strategy as ''emergent'';\n* Strategy as position \u2013 locating brands, products, or companies within the market, based on the conceptual framework of consumers or other stakeholders; a strategy determined primarily by factors outside the firm;\n* Strategy as ploy \u2013 a specific maneuver intended to outwit a competitor; and\n* Strategy as perspective \u2013 executing strategy based on a \"theory of the business\" or natural extension of the mindset or ideological perspective of the organization.<ref>Mintzberg, H.

Every player in a [[non-cooperative game|non-trivial game]] has a set of possible strategies to use when choosing what moves to make.\n\nA strategy may recursively [[min-max|look ahead]] and consider what actions can happen in each contingent state of the game\u2014e.g. if the player takes action 1, then that presents the opponent with a certain situation, which might be good or bad, whereas if the player takes action 2 then the opponents will be presented with a different situation, and in each case the choices they make will determine their own future situation.\n\nStrategies in game theory may be [[mixed strategy|random (mixed)]] or deterministic (pure). Pure strategies can be thought of as a special case of mixed strategies, in which only probabilities 0 or 1 are assigned to actions.\n\nStrategy based games generally require a player to think through a sequence of solutions to determine the best way to defeat the opponent.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Concept Driven Strategy]]\n* [[Odds algorithm]] (odds strategy)\n* [[Strategy game]]\n* [[Strategy pattern]]\n* [[Strategic planning]]\n* [[Strategic management]]\n* [[Strategist]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* Burgleman, James.
