It was developed in parallel with the [[analog computer]]s of the day.\n\nThe pocket sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the [[Intel 4004|first microprocessor]] developed by [[Intel]] for the Japanese calculator company [[Busicom]] (Which was Intel's first microprocessor). They later became commonly used within the [[Petroleum industry|Oil and Gas industry]].\n\nModern [[Electronics|electronic]] calculators vary: from cheap, give-away, [[ISO/IEC 7810|credit-card-sized]] models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers. They became popular in the mid-1970s (as [[integrated circuit]]s made their size and cost small).  By the end of that decade, calculator prices had reduced to a point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in [[school]]s.\n\nComputer [[operating system]]s as far back as [[Ancient UNIX Systems|early Unix]] have included interactive calculator [[Computer program|programs]] such as [[dc (computer program)|dc]] and [[hoc (programming language)|hoc]], and calculator functions are included in almost all [[Personal digital assistant|PDA-type]] devices (save a few dedicated address book and dictionary devices).\n\nIn addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific [[Market (economics)|markets]]; for example, there are [[scientific calculator]]s which include [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] and [[statistics|statistical]] calculations. Some calculators even have the ability to do [[Symbolic computation|computer algebra]]. [[Graphing calculator]]s can be used to graph functions defined on the real line, or higher-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. Currently, basic calculators are inexpensive, but the [[Scientific calculator|scientific]] and [[Graphing calculator|graphing]] models tend to be higher priced. \n\nIn 1986, calculators still represented an estimated 41% of the world's general-purpose hardware capacity to compute information. This diminished to less than 0.05% by 2007.<ref name=\"HilbertLopez2011\">[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 \"The World\u2019s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information\"], Martin Hilbert and Priscila L\u00f3pez (2011), [[Science (journal)]], 332(6025), 60\u201365; see also [http://www.martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html \"free access to the study\"].</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:CalculatorFractions-5550x.jpg|thumb|Scientific calculator displays of fractions and decimal equivalents.]]\n\n===Input===\nModern 2016 [[Electronics|electronic]] calculators contain a [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] with [[buttons]] for [[Numerical digit|digit]]s and [[arithmetic]]al operations; some even contain \"00\" and \"000\" buttons to make larger or smaller [[number]]s easier to enter. Most basic calculators assign only one digit or operation on each button; however, in more specific calculators, a button can perform multi-function working with [[key combination]]s.\n\n===Display output===\nCalculators usually have [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCD) as output in place of historical [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) displays and [[vacuum fluorescent displays]] (VFD); details are provided in the section ''[[#Technical improvements|Technical improvements]]''.\n\nLarge-sized [[Number|figures]] and [[comma]] separators are often used to improve readability. Various symbols for [[Command (computing)|function commands]] may also be shown on the display. [[Fractions]] such as {{math|{{frac|1|3}}}} are displayed as decimal [[approximations]], for example rounded to {{math|0.33333333}}. Also, some [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] (such as {{math|{{frac|1|7}}}}, which is {{math|0.14285714285714}}; to 14 [[significant figures]]) can be difficult to recognize in [[decimal]] form; as a result, many [[Scientific calculator|scientific]] calculators are able to work in [[vulgar fraction]]s or [[mixed number]]s.\n\n===Memory===\nCalculators also have the ability to store numbers into [[computer memory]]. Basic types of these store only one number at a time; more specific types are able to store many numbers represented in [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s. The variables can also be used for constructing [[formula]]s. Some models have the ability to extend [[Computer memory|memory]] capacity to store more numbers; the extended [[memory address]] is referred to as an [[array data structure|array]] index.\n\n===Power source===\nPower sources of calculators are: [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[Amorphous silicon#Solar cells|solar cells]] or [[mains electricity]] (for old models), turning on with a [[switch]] or button. Some models even have no turn-off button but they provide some way to put off (for example, leaving no operation for a moment, covering [[solar cell]] exposure, or closing their [[Lid (container)|lid]]). [[Crank (mechanism)|Crank]]-powered calculators were also common in the early computer era.\n\n===Key layout===\n{| border=\"0\"\n|+ '''Usual basic pocket calculator layout'''\n| valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| MC || MR || M- || M+\n|-\n| C || \u00b1 || % || \u221a\n|-\n| 7 || 8 || 9 || \u00f7\n|-\n| 4 || 5 || 6 || \u00d7\n|-\n| 1 || 2 || 3 || \u2212\n|-\n| 0 || . || = || +\n|}\n|\n{| border=\"0\"\n|-\n| MC or CM || '''M'''emory '''C'''lear\n|-\n| MR or RM || '''M'''emory '''R'''ecall\n|-\n| M- || '''M'''emory '''Sub'''traction\n|-\n| M+ || '''M'''emory '''Add'''ition\n|-\n| C or AC || '''A'''ll '''C'''lear\n|-\n| CE || '''C'''lear (last) '''E'''ntry; sometimes called CE/C: a first press clears the last entry (CE), a second press clears all (C)\n|-\n| \u00b1 || Toggle positive/negative number\n|-\n| % || [[Percentage|Per cent]]\n|-\n| \u00f7 || [[Division (mathematics)|Division]]\n|-\n| \u00d7 || [[Multiplication]]\n|-\n| \u2013 || [[Subtraction]]\n|-\n| + || [[Addition]]\n|-\n| . || [[Decimal point]]\n|-\n| \u221a || [[Square root]]\n|-\n| = || Result\n|}\n|}\n\n==Internal workings==\nIn general, a basic [[Electronics|electronic]] calculator consists of the following components:<ref>John Lewis, ''The Pocket Calculator Book''. (London: Usborne, 1982)</ref>\n* Power source ([[Mains electricity]], [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] and/or [[Amorphous silicon#Solar cells|solar cell]])\n* [[Keypad]] (Input device) \u2013 consists of keys used to input numbers and function commands ([[addition]], [[multiplication]], [[Square root|square-root]], etc.)\n* Display panel (Output device) \u2013 displays input numbers, commands and results. [[Liquid-crystal display|LCDs]], [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFDs]], and [[LED display]]s use [[Seven-segment display|seven segments]] to represent each [[Numerical digit|digit]] in a basic calculator. Advanced calculators may use [[dot matrix]] displays.\n** A printing calculator, in addition to a display panel, has a printing unit that prints results in ink onto a roll of paper, using a printing mechanism.\n* Processor [[Chipset|chip]] ([[microprocessor]] or [[central processing unit]]).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Processor chip's contents\n!Unit \n!Function \n|- \n|Scanning ([[Polling (computer science)|Polling]]) unit \n|When a calculator is powered on, it scans the [[keypad]] waiting to pick up an [[Signal (electrical engineering)|electrical signal]] when a key is pressed.  \n|- \n|[[Encoder|Encoder unit]] \n|Converts the [[number]]s and [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] into [[binary code]]. \n|- \n|X [[Processor register|register]] and Y register \n|They are number stores where numbers are stored temporarily while doing calculations.

It is used as an indicator of the processor's speed, and is measured in ''clock cycles per second'' or the [[International System of Units|SI]] unit [[Hertz|hertz (Hz)]]. For basic calculators, the speed can vary from a few hundred [[hertz]] to the [[kilohertz]] range.\n[[File:Tischrechner Walther ETR2034S resized.jpg|thumb|upright|An office calculating machine with a paper printer.]]\n\n===Example===\nA basic explanation as to how calculations are performed in a simple 4-function calculator:\n\nTo perform the calculation 25&nbsp;+&nbsp;9, one presses keys in the following sequence on most calculators: {{key press|2}}&nbsp;{{key press|5}}&nbsp;{{key press|+}}&nbsp;{{key press|9}}&nbsp;{{key press|{{=}}}}.\n:* When {{key press|2}}&nbsp;{{key press|5}} is entered, it is picked up by the scanning unit; the number 25 is encoded and sent to the X register;\n:* Next, when the {{key press|+}} key is pressed, the \"[[addition]]\" instruction is also encoded and sent to the [[Status register|flag register]];\n:* The second number {{Key press|9}} is encoded and sent to the X register. This \"pushes\" (shifts) the first number out into the Y register;\n:* When the {{key press|{{=}}}} key is pressed, a \"message\" (signal) from the [[Status register|flag register]] tells the [[Non-volatile memory|permanent memory]] that the operation to be done is \"[[addition]]\";\n:* The numbers in the X and Y registers are then loaded into the [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]] and the calculation is carried out following instructions from the [[Non-volatile memory|permanent memory]];\n:* The answer, 34 is sent (shifted) back to the X register. From there, it is converted by the [[Binary decoder|decoder]] unit into a decimal number (usually [[binary-coded decimal]]), and then shown on the display panel.\n\nOther functions are usually carried out using repeated additions or subtractions. Where calculators have additional functions (such as square root, or trigonometric functions), software [[algorithm]]s are required to produce high precision results. Sometimes significant design effort is required to fit all the desired functions in the limited memory space available in the calculator [[Chipset|chip]], with acceptable calculation time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/72jun/jun72a2.pdf |title=David S. Cochran, '&#39;Algorithms and accuracy in the HP35'&#39;, '&#39;Hewlett Packard Journal'&#39;, June 1972 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref>\n\n==Calculators compared to computers==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}\nThe fundamental difference between a calculator and [[computer]] is that a computer can be [[Computer programming|programmed]] in a way that allows the [[Computer program|program]] to take different [[Branch on condition|branches according to intermediate results]], while calculators are pre-designed with specific functions (such as [[addition]], [[multiplication]], and [[logarithm]]s) built in. The distinction is not clear-cut: some devices classed as [[Programmable calculator|programmable]] calculators have [[Computer programming|programming]] functionality, sometimes with support for [[programming language]]s (such as [[RPL programming language|RPL]] or [[TI-BASIC]]).\n\nTypically, the user buys the least expensive model having a specific feature set, but does not care much about speed (since speed is constrained by how fast the user can press the buttons). Thus designers of calculators strive to minimize the number of logic elements on the [[Chipset|chip]], not the number of [[clock cycles]] needed to do a computation.\n\nFor instance, instead of a hardware multiplier, a calculator might implement [[floating point]] mathematics with code in [[Read-only memory|ROM]], and compute [[Trigonometric functions|trigonometric]] functions with the [[CORDIC]] algorithm because [[CORDIC]] does not require much multiplication. [[Bit serial]] logic designs are more common in calculators whereas [[bit parallel]] designs dominate general-purpose computers, because a bit serial design minimizes [[Chipset|chip]] complexity, but takes many more [[clock cycles]]. (Again, the line blurs with high-end calculators, which use processor chips associated with computer and embedded systems design, particularly the [[Z80]], [[MC68000]], and [[ARM architecture|ARM]] architectures, as well as some custom designs specifically made for the calculator market.)\n\n==History==\n\n===Precursors to the electronic calculator===\n{{main article|Mechanical calculator}}\n{{See also|Human computer}}\n\nThe first known tools used to aid arithmetic calculations were: bones (used to tally items), pebbles and [[counting board]]s, and the [[abacus]], known to have been used by [[Sumer]]ians and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] before 2000 BC.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Ifrah|2001|p=11}}</ref> Except for the [[Antikythera mechanism]] (an \"out of the time\" [[Astronomy|astronomical]] device), development of computing tools arrived near the beginning of the 17th century: the [[Sector (instrument)|geometric-military compass]] (by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]), [[logarithm]]s and [[Napier bones]] (by [[John Napier|Napier]]), and the [[slide rule]] (by [[Edmund Gunter]]).\n\n[[File:17th-century-mechanical-calculators.jpg|thumb|17th century mechanical calculators.]]\nIn 1642, the [[Renaissance]] saw the invention of the [[mechanical calculator]] (by [[Wilhelm Schickard]]<ref>See for example, http://calculatorhistory.net</ref> and several decades later [[Blaise Pascal]]<ref>Pascal's invention of the [[calculating machine]].  Pascal invented his machine just four hundred years ago, as a youth of nineteen.  He was spurred to it by sharing the burden of arithmetical labor involved in his father's official work as supervisor of taxes at Rouen.  He conceived the idea of doing the work mechanically, and developed a design appropriate for this purpose ; showing herein the same combination of pure science and mechanical genius that characterized his whole life.  But it was one thing to conceive and design the machine, and another to get it made and put into use.  Here were needed those practical gifts that he displayed later in his inventions....<br>\nIn a sense, Pascal's invention was premature, in that the mechanical arts in his time were not sufficiently advanced to enable his machine to be made at an economic price, with the accuracy and strength needed for reasonably long use.  This difficulty was not overcome until well on into the nineteenth century, by which time also a renewed stimulus to invention was given by the need for many kinds of calculation more intricate than those considered by Pascal. [[#NAT CHAP|S. Chapman, Magazine Nature]], pp.508,509 (1942)</ref>), a device that was at times somewhat over-promoted as being able to perform all four [[arithmetic]] operations with minimal human intervention.<ref>\"Pascal and Leibnitz, in the seventeenth century, and Diderot at a later period, endeavored to construct a machine which might serve as a substitute for human intelligence in the combination of figures\" [https://books.google.com/books?id=Rf0IAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA100&dq=arithmometer&as_brr=1#v=onepage&q=arithmometer&f=false The Gentleman's magazine, Volume 202, p.100]</ref> [[Pascal's Calculator]] could add and subtract two numbers directly and thus, if the tedium could be borne, multiply and divide by repetition. Schickard's machine, constructed several decades earlier, used a clever set of mechanised multiplication tables to ease the process of multiplication and division with the adding machine as a means of completing this operation.  (Because they were different inventions with different aims a debate about whether Pascal or Schickard should be credited as the \"inventor\" of the adding machine (or calculating machine) is probably pointless.<ref>See [http://metastudies.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.SchicardvsPascal Pascal vs Schickard: An empty debate?]</ref>)  Schickard and Pascal were followed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] who spent forty years designing a four-operation mechanical calculator, inventing in the process his [[leibniz wheel]], but who couldn't design a fully operational machine.<ref>In 1893, the German calculating machine inventor Arthur Burkhardt was asked to put Leibniz machine in operating condition if possible.  His report was favorable except for the sequence in the carry {{cite book|last=Ginsburg|first=Jekuthiel|title=Scripta Mathematica|year=1933|publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC|isbn=978-0-7661-3835-3|page=149}}</ref>  There were also five unsuccessful attempts to design a calculating clock in the 17th century.<ref>see [[Mechanical calculator#Calculating clocks: unsuccessful mechanical calculators]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Grant mechanical calculating machine 1877.jpg|thumb|left|The Grant mechanical calculating machine, 1877.]]\nThe 18th century saw the arrival of some interesting improvements, first by [[Giovanni Poleni|Poleni]] with the first fully functional calculating clock and four-operation machine, but these machines were almost always ''one of the kind''. It was not until the 19th century and the [[Industrial Revolution]] that real developments began to occur.  Although machines capable of performing all four arithmetic functions existed prior to the 19th century, the refinement of manufacturing and fabrication processes during the eve of the industrial revolution made large scale production of more compact and modern units possible.  The [[Arithmometer]], invented in 1820 as a four-operation mechanical calculator, was released to production in 1851 as an adding machine and became the first commercially successful unit; forty years later, by 1890, about 2,500 arithmometers had been sold<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arithmometre.org/NumerosSerie/PageNumerosSeriePayen.html |title=(retrieved on 01/02/2012) |language=fr |publisher=Arithmometre.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref> plus a few hundreds more from two arithmometer clone makers (Burkhardt, Germany, 1878 and Layton, UK, 1883) and Felt and Tarrant, the only other competitor in true commercial production, had sold 100 [[comptometer]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Felt|first=Dorr E.|title=Mechanical arithmetic, or The history of the counting machine|publisher=Washington Institute|location=Chicago|page=4|year=1916|url=https://archive.org/details/mechanicalarithm00feltrich}}</ref>\n\nIt wasn't until 1902 that the familiar push-button user interface was developed, with the introduction of the Dalton Adding Machine, developed by James L. Dalton in the [[United States]].\n\nThe [[Curta calculator]] was developed in 1948 and, although costly, became popular for its portability. This purely mechanical hand-held device could do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. By the early 1970s electronic pocket calculators ended manufacture of mechanical calculators, although the Curta remains a popular collectable item.\n\n===Development of electronic calculators===\nThe first [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] computers, using firstly [[vacuum tube]]s and later [[transistor]]s in the logic circuits, appeared in the 1940s and 1950s. This technology was to provide a stepping stone to the development of electronic calculators.\n\nThe [[Casio|Casio Computer Company]], in [[Japan]], released the Model ''14-A'' calculator in 1957, which was the world's first all-electric (relatively) \"compact\" calculator. It did not use electronic logic but was based on [[relay]] technology, and was built into a desk.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Casio 101E nixietube disp 1dv.jpg|thumb|Powered [[Nixie tube]] display inside an old 1960s Casio 101E desktop calculator]] -->\n[[File:LED DISP.JPG|thumb|right|Early calculator [[LED]] display from the 1970s.]]\n\nIn October 1961, the world's first ''all-electronic desktop'' calculator, the British [[Bell Punch]]/Sumlock Comptometer [[Sumlock ANITA calculator|ANITA]] ('''A''' '''N'''ew '''I'''nspiration '''T'''o '''A'''rithmetic/'''A'''ccounting) was announced.<ref>\"Simple and Silent\", ''Office Magazine'', December 1961, p1244</ref><ref>\"'Anita' der erste tragbare elektonische Rechenautomat\" [trans: \"the first portable electronic computer\"], ''Buromaschinen Mechaniker'', November 1961, p207</ref> This machine used [[vacuum tube]]s, cold-cathode tubes and [[Dekatron]]s in its circuits, with 12 cold-cathode [[Nixie tube|\"Nixie\"]] tubes for its display. Two models were displayed, the Mk VII for continental Europe and the Mk VIII for Britain and the rest of the world, both for delivery from early 1962. The Mk VII was a slightly earlier design with a more complicated mode of multiplication, and was soon dropped in favour of the simpler Mark VIII. The ANITA had a full keyboard, similar to mechanical [[comptometer]]s of the time, a feature that was unique to it and the later [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] CS-10A among electronic calculators. The ANITA weighed roughly {{convert|33|lb|kg}} due to its large tube system.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ball|first1=Guy|last2=Flamm|first2=Bruce|title=The History of Pocket Electronic Calculators|url=http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/history_of_electronic_calculat.html|website=vintagecalculators.com|publisher=[[Vintage Calculators Web Museum]]|accessdate=8 July 2014}}</ref> Bell Punch had been producing key-driven mechanical calculators of the comptometer type under the names \"Plus\" and \"Sumlock\", and had realised in the mid-1950s that the future of calculators lay in electronics. They employed the young graduate Norbert Kitz, who had worked on the early British [[Pilot ACE]] computer project, to lead the development. The [[Sumlock ANITA calculator|ANITA]] sold well since it was the only electronic desktop calculator available, and was silent and quick.\n\nThe tube technology of the [[Sumlock ANITA calculator|ANITA]] was superseded in June 1963 by the U.S. manufactured [[Friden, Inc.|Friden]] EC-130, which had an all-transistor design, a stack of four 13-digit numbers displayed on a {{convert|5|in|cm|adj=on}} [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]], and introduced [[reverse Polish notation]] (RPN) to the calculator market for a price of $2200, which was about three times the cost of an electromechanical calculator of the time. Like Bell Punch, Friden was a manufacturer of mechanical calculators that had decided that the future lay in electronics. In 1964 more all-transistor electronic calculators were introduced: [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] introduced the [[CS-10A]], which weighed 25&nbsp;kg (55&nbsp;lb) and cost 500,000 yen (~US$2500), and Industria Macchine Elettroniche of Italy introduced the IME 84, to which several extra keyboard and display units could be connected so that several people could make use of it (but apparently not at the same time).\n\nThere followed a series of electronic calculator models from these and other manufacturers, including Canon, Mathatronics, [[Olivetti]], SCM (Smith-Corona-Marchant), Sony, Toshiba, and Wang. The early calculators used hundreds of [[Bipolar junction transistor#Germanium transistors|germanium transistors]], which were cheaper than [[Transistor#Semiconductor material|silicon transistor]]s, on multiple circuit boards. Display types used were [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]], cold-cathode [[Nixie tube]]s, and [[filament lamp]]s. Memory technology was usually based on the [[delay line memory]] or the [[magnetic core memory]], though the Toshiba \"Toscal\" BC-1411 appears to have used an early form of [[dynamic RAM]] built from discrete components. Already there was a desire for smaller and less power-hungry machines.\n\nThe [[Olivetti]] [[Programma 101]] was introduced in late 1965; it was a stored program machine which could read and write magnetic cards and displayed results on its built-in printer. Memory, implemented by an acoustic delay line, could be partitioned between program steps, constants, and data registers. Programming allowed conditional testing and programs could also be overlaid by reading from magnetic cards. It is regarded as the first personal computer produced by a company (that is, a desktop '''electronic calculating machine''' programmable by non-specialists for personal use). The [[Olivetti]] Programma 101 won many industrial design awards.\n\n[[File:Elka-22 (I197211).png|thumb|The Bulgarian [[ELKA 22]].]]\nAnother calculator introduced in 1965 was [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria's]] [[ELKA#ELKA 6521|ELKA 6521]],<ref name=\"elka\">[http://clockwiser.wordpress.com/2012/01/10/elka-hist/ The Bulgarian ELKA electronic calculators], ''Clockwiser''.

A large, printing, desk-top unit, with an attached floor-standing logic tower, it could be programmed to perform many computer-like functions. However, the only ''branch'' instruction was an implied unconditional branch (GOTO) at the end of the operation stack, returning the program to its starting instruction. Thus, it was not possible to include any [[conditional branch]] (IF-THEN-ELSE) logic. During this era, the absence of the conditional branch was sometimes used to distinguish a programmable calculator from a computer.\n\nThe first handheld calculator, a prototype called \"Cal Tech\", was developed by [[Texas Instruments]] in 1967. It could add, multiply, subtract, and divide, and its output device was a paper tape.<ref>[http://education.ti.com/educationportal/sites/US/nonProductSingle/about_press_release_news37.html Texas Instruments Celebrates the 35th Anniversary of Its Invention of the Calculator] [[Texas Instruments]] press release, 15 August 2002.</ref><ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14845433 Electronic Calculator Invented 40 Years Ago] All Things Considered, NPR, 30 September 2007.

There were great efforts to put the logic required for a calculator into fewer and fewer [[integrated circuits]] (chips) and calculator electronics was one of the leading edges of [[semiconductor]] development. U.S. semiconductor manufacturers led the world in Large Scale Integration (LSI) semiconductor development, squeezing more and more functions into individual integrated circuits. This led to alliances between Japanese calculator manufacturers and U.S. semiconductor companies: [[Canon (company)|Canon Inc.]] with [[Texas Instruments]], [[Sharp Corporation|Hayakawa Electric]] (later known as Sharp Corporation) with [[Rockwell International|North-American Rockwell Microelectronics]], [[Busicom]] with [[Mostek]] and [[Intel]], and [[General Instrument]] with [[Sanyo]].\n\n====Pocket calculators====\n{{redirect|Pocket calculator|the song|Computer World}}\n\nBy 1970, a calculator could be made using just a few chips of low power consumption, allowing portable models powered from rechargeable batteries. The first portable calculators appeared in Japan in 1970, and were soon marketed around the world. These included the [[Sanyo]] ICC-0081 \"Mini Calculator\", the [[Canon (company)|Canon]] Pocketronic, and the [[Sharp QT-8B]] \"micro Compet\". The Canon Pocketronic was a development of the \"Cal-Tech\" project which had been started at [[Texas Instruments]] in 1965 as a research project to produce a portable calculator. The Pocketronic has no traditional display; numerical output is on thermal paper tape. As a result of the \"Cal-Tech\" project, Texas Instruments was granted master patents on portable calculators.\n\nSharp put in great efforts in size and power reduction and introduced in January 1971 the [[Sharp EL-8]], also marketed as the Facit 1111, which was close to being a pocket calculator. It weighed 1.59 pounds (721 grams), had a vacuum fluorescent display, rechargeable [[NiCad]] batteries, and initially sold for $US395.\n\nHowever, the efforts in [[integrated circuit development]] culminated in the introduction in early 1971 of the first \"calculator on a chip\", the MK6010 by [[Mostek]],<ref>\"Single Chip Calculator Hits the Finish Line\", ''Electronics'', February 1, 1971, p19</ref> followed by Texas Instruments later in the year. Although these early hand-held calculators were very expensive, these advances in electronics, together with developments in display technology (such as the [[vacuum fluorescent display]], [[LED]], and [[LCD]]), led within a few years to the cheap pocket calculator available to all.\n\nIn 1971 [[Pico Electronics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spingal.plus.com/micro |title=Microprocessor History |publisher=Spingal.plus.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-19}}</ref> and [[General Instrument]] also introduced their first collaboration in ICs, a complete single chip calculator IC for the Monroe Royal Digital III calculator. Pico was a spinout by five GI design engineers whose vision was to create single chip calculator ICs. Pico and GI went on to have significant success in the burgeoning handheld calculator market.\n\nThe first truly pocket-sized electronic calculator was the [[Busicom]] LE-120A \"HANDY\", which was marketed early in 1971.<ref>\"The one-chip calculator is here, and it's only the beginning\", Electronic Design, February 18, 1971, p34.</ref> Made in Japan, this was also the first calculator to use an [[LED]] display, the first hand-held calculator to use a single integrated circuit (then proclaimed as a \"calculator on a chip\"), the [[Mostek]] MK6010, and the first electronic calculator to run off replaceable batteries. Using four AA-size cells the LE-120A measures 4.9 x 2.8 x 0.9 in (124 x 72 x 24&nbsp;mm).\n\nThe first European-made pocket-sized calculator, DB 800<ref>http://www.epocalc.net/pages/calc_premieres</ref><ref>http://www.jutarnji.hr/40--rodendan-digitrona--u-bujama-je-izraden-prvi-europski-dzepni-kalkulator--te-1971-kostao-je-koliko-i-fico/954368/</ref> is made in May 1971 by [[Digitron (company)|Digitron]] in [[Buje]], [[Croatia]] (former [[Yugoslavia]]) with four functions and an eight-digit display and special characters for a negative number and a warning that the calculation has too many digits to display.\n\nThe first American-made pocket-sized calculator, the Bowmar 901B (popularly referred to as ''The Bowmar Brain''), measuring 5.2 \u00d7 3.0 \u00d7 1.5 in (131 \u00d7 77 \u00d7 37&nbsp;mm), came out in the Autumn of 1971, with four functions and an eight-digit red [[light-emitting diode|LED]] display, for $240, while in August 1972 the four-function [[Sinclair Executive]] became the first slimline pocket calculator measuring 5.4 \u00d7 2.2 \u00d7 0.35 in (138 \u00d7 56 \u00d7 9&nbsp;mm) and weighing 2.5&nbsp;oz (70&nbsp;g). It retailed for around \u00a379. By the end of the decade, similar calculators were priced less than \u00a35.\n\nThe first Soviet-made pocket-sized calculator, the \"Elektronika B3-04\" was developed by the end of 1973 and sold at the beginning of 1974.\n\nOne of the first low-cost calculators was the [[Sinclair Cambridge]], launched in August 1973. It retailed for \u00a329.95, or \u00a35 less in kit form. The Sinclair calculators were successful because they were far cheaper than the competition; however, their design led to slow and inaccurate computations of [[transcendental function]]s.<ref>[http://righto.com/sinclair Reversing Sinclair's amazing 1974 calculator hack \u2013 half the ROM of the HP-35], Ken Shirriff, 2013.

Launched in early 1972 it was unlike the other basic four-function pocket calculators then available in that it was the first pocket calculator with ''scientific'' functions that could replace a [[slide rule]]. The $395 [[HP-35]], along with nearly all later HP engineering calculators, used [[reverse Polish notation]] (RPN), also called postfix notation. A calculation like \"8 plus 5\" is, using RPN, performed by pressing \"8\", \"Enter\u2191\", \"5\", and \"+\"; instead of the algebraic [[infix notation]]: \"8\", \"+\", \"5\", \"=\". It had 35 buttons and was based on Mostek Mk6020 chip.\n\nThe first Soviet ''scientific'' pocket-sized calculator the \"B3-18\" was completed by the end of 1975.\n\nIn 1973, [[Texas Instruments]] (TI) introduced the [[TI SR-50|SR-10]], (''SR'' signifying [[slide rule]]) an ''algebraic entry'' pocket calculator using [[scientific notation]] for $150. Shortly after the SR-11 featured an additional key for entering [[Pi|\"\u03c0\"]]. It was followed the next year by the [[TI SR-50|SR-50]] which added log and trig functions to compete with the HP-35, and in 1977 the mass-marketed [[TI-30]] line which is still produced.\n\nIn 1978 a new company, [[Calculated Industries]], came onto the scene, focusing on specific markets. Their first calculator, the Loan Arranger<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/CI/loanarranger2.htm |title=The Loan Arranger II |publisher=Mathcs.albion.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-07-19}}</ref> (1978) was a pocket calculator marketed to the Real Estate industry with preprogrammed functions to simplify the process of calculating payments and future values. In 1985, CI launched a calculator for the construction industry called the Construction Master<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/CI/CM.htm |title=Construction Master |publisher=Mathcs.albion.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-07-19}}</ref> which came preprogrammed with common construction calculations (such as angles, stairs, roofing math, pitch, rise, run, and feet-inch fraction conversions). This would be the first in a line of construction related calculators.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Calculator Adler 81S.jpg|Adler 81S pocket calculator with [[vacuum fluorescent display]] (VFD) from the mid-1970s.\nFile:Casio cm602.jpg|The Casio CM-602 Mini electronic calculator provided basic functions in the 1970s.\nFile:SinclairExecutive-01.jpg|The 1972 [[Sinclair Executive]] pocket calculator.\nFile:Hp-35 1972.jpg|The [[HP-35]], the world's first scientific pocket calculator by Hewlett Packard (1972).\n</gallery>\n\n====Programmable calculators====\n{{Main article|Programmable calculator}}\n[[File:HP 65.jpg|thumb|The [[HP-65]], the first programmable pocket calculator (1974).]]\nThe first desktop ''programmable calculators'' were produced in the mid-1960s by [[Mathatronics]] and [[Casio]] (AL-1000). These machines were, however, very heavy and expensive. The first programmable pocket calculator was the [[HP-65]], in 1974; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in magnetic card reader. Two years later the [[HP-25C]] introduced ''[[HP Continuous memory|continuous memory]]'', i.e. programs and data were retained in [[CMOS]] memory during power-off. In 1979, HP released the first ''[[alphanumeric]]'', programmable, ''expandable'' calculator, the [[HP-41]]C. It could be expanded with [[random access memory|RAM]] (memory) and [[read-only memory|ROM]] (software) modules, as well as peripherals like [[bar code]] readers, [[microcassette]] and [[floppy disk]] drives, paper-roll [[thermal printer]]s, and miscellaneous communication interfaces ([[RS-232]], [[HP-IL]], [[HP-IB]]).\n\nThe first Soviet programmable desktop calculator [[ISKRA 123]], powered by the power grid, was released at the beginning of the 1970s. The first Soviet pocket battery-powered programmable calculator, [[Elektronika]] \"[[B3-21]]\", was developed by the end of 1977 and released at the beginning of 1978. The successor of B3-21, the [[Elektronika B3-34]] wasn't backward compatible with B3-21, even if it kept the [[reverse Polish notation]] (RPN). Thus B3-34 defined a new command set, which later was used in a series of later programmable Soviet calculators. Despite very limited capabilities (98 bytes of instruction memory and about 19 stack and addressable registers), people managed to write all kinds of programs for them, including [[adventure game]]s and libraries of calculus-related functions for engineers. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of programs were written for these machines, from practical scientific and business software, which were used in real-life offices and labs, to fun games for children. The [[Elektronika MK-52]] calculator (using the extended B3-34 command set, and featuring internal [[EEPROM]] memory for storing programs and external interface for EEPROM cards and other periphery) was used in Soviet spacecraft program (for [[Soyuz TM-7]] flight) as a backup of the board computer.\n\nThis series of calculators was also noted for a large number of highly counter-intuitive mysterious undocumented features, somewhat similar to \"synthetic programming\" of the American [[HP-41]], which were exploited by applying normal arithmetic operations to error messages, jumping to non-existent addresses and other techniques. A number of respected monthly publications, including the popular science magazine \"[[Nauka i Zhizn|\u041d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c]]\" (\"Science and Life\"), featured special columns, dedicated to optimization techniques for calculator programmers and updates on undocumented features for hackers, which grew into a whole esoteric science with many branches, known as \"yeggogology\" (\"\u0435\u0433\u0433\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f\"). The error messages on those calculators appear as a Russian word \"YEGGOG\" (\"\u0415\u0413\u0413\u041e\u0413\") which, unsurprisingly, is translated to \"Error\".\n\nA similar hacker culture in the USA revolved around the [[HP-41]], which was also noted for a large number of undocumented features and was much more powerful than [[B3-34]].\n\n====Technical improvements====\n[[File:Solar-calculator.jpg|thumb|A calculator which runs on solar and battery power.]]\nThrough the 1970s the hand-held electronic calculator underwent rapid development. The red LED and blue/green [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s consumed a lot of power and the calculators either had a short battery life (often measured in hours, so rechargeable [[nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium batteries]] were common) or were large so that they could take larger, higher capacity batteries. In the early 1970s [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCDs) were in their infancy and there was a great deal of concern that they only had a short operating lifetime. Busicom introduced the Busicom ''LE-120A \"HANDY\"'' calculator, the first pocket-sized calculator and the first with an [[LED]] display, and announced the Busicom ''LC'' with LCD. However, there were problems with this display and the calculator never went on sale. The first successful calculators with LCDs were manufactured by [[Rockwell International]] and sold from 1972 by other companies under such names as: Dataking ''LC-800'', Harden ''DT/12'', Ibico ''086'', Lloyds ''40'', Lloyds ''100'', Prismatic ''500'' (a.k.a. ''P500''), Rapid Data ''Rapidman 1208LC''. The LCDs were an early form using the ''Dynamic Scattering Mode DSM''  with the numbers appearing as bright against a dark background. To present a high-contrast display these models illuminated the LCD using a filament lamp and solid plastic light guide, which negated the low power consumption of the display. These models appear to have been sold only for a year or two.\n\nA more successful series of calculators using a reflective DSM-LCD was launched in 1972 by [[Sharp Inc]] with the Sharp ''EL-805'', which was a slim pocket calculator. This, and another few similar models, used Sharp's \"COS\" (Calculator On Substrate) technology. An extension of one glass plate needed for the Liquid Crystal Display was used as a substrate to mount the required chips based on a new hybrid technology. The \"COS\" technology may have been too expensive since it was only used in a few models before Sharp reverted to conventional circuit boards.\n\nIn the mid-1970s the first calculators appeared with field-effect, ''Twisted Nematic TN''  LCDs with dark numerals against a grey background, though the early ones often had a yellow filter over them to cut out damaging [[ultraviolet]] rays. The advantage of LCDs is that they are passive light modulators reflecting light, which require much less power than light-emitting displays such as LEDs or VFDs. This led the way to the first credit-card-sized calculators, such as the [[Casio]] ''Mini Card LC-78'' of 1978, which could run for months of normal use on button cells.\n\nThere were also improvements to the electronics inside the calculators. All of the logic functions of a calculator had been squeezed into the first \"Calculator on a chip\" [[integrated circuits]] in 1971, but this was leading edge technology of the time and yields were low and costs were high. Many calculators continued to use two or more [[integrated circuits]] (ICs), especially the scientific and the programmable ones, into the late 1970s.\n\nThe power consumption of the integrated circuits was also reduced, especially with the introduction of [[CMOS]] technology. Appearing in the Sharp \"EL-801\" in 1972, the [[transistor]]s in the logic cells of CMOS ICs only used any appreciable power when they changed state. The [[LED]] and [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays often required additional driver transistors or ICs, whereas the LCDs were more amenable to being driven directly by the calculator IC itself.\n\nWith this low power consumption came the possibility of using [[solar cells]] as the power source, realised around 1978 by such calculators as the Royal ''Solar 1'', Sharp ''EL-8026'', and Teal ''Photon''.\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:CasioFX20-inside.jpg|The interior of a Casio fx-20 scientific calculator from the mid-1970s, using a VFD. The processor integrated circuit (IC) is made by [[NEC]]. Discrete electronic components like [[capacitor]]s and [[resistor]]s and the IC are mounted on a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB). This calculator uses a battery pack as a power source.\nFile:Sharp el-323 ic 1ae.jpg|The processor chip (integrated circuit package) inside a 1981 Sharp pocket calculator, marked SC6762 1\u2022H.

The processor is a \"Chip on Board\" type, covered with dark [[epoxy]].\n</gallery>\n\n====Mass market phase====\nAt the beginning of the 1970s hand-held electronic calculators were very expensive, costing two or three weeks' wages, and so were a luxury item. The high price was due to their construction requiring many mechanical and electronic components which were expensive to produce, and production runs were not very large. Many companies saw that there were good profits to be made in the calculator business with the margin on these high prices. However, the cost of calculators fell as components and their production techniques improved, and the effect of economies of scale was felt.\n\nBy 1976 the cost of the cheapest four-function pocket calculator had dropped to a few dollars, about one 20th of the cost five years earlier. The consequences of this were that the pocket calculator was affordable, and that it was now difficult for the manufacturers to make a profit out of calculators, leading to many companies dropping out of the business or closing down altogether. The companies that survived making calculators tended to be those with high outputs of higher quality calculators, or producing high-specification scientific and programmable calculators.\n\n===Mid-1980s to present===\nThe first calculator capable of symbolic computation was the [[HP-28]]C, released in 1987. It was able to, for example, solve quadratic equations symbolically. The first [[graphing calculator]] was the [[Casio fx-7000G]] released in 1985.\n\nThe two leading manufacturers, HP and TI, released increasingly feature-laden calculators during the 1980s and 1990s. At the turn of the millennium, the line between a graphing calculator and a [[handheld computer]] was not always clear, as some very advanced calculators such as the [[TI-89]], the [[TI-92 series|Voyage 200]] and [[HP-49G]] could [[derivative|differentiate]] and [[integral|integrate]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, solve [[differential equation]]s, run [[word processing]] and [[Personal information manager|PIM]] software, and connect by wire or [[infrared|IR]] to other calculators/computers.\n\nThe [[HP-12C|HP 12c]] financial calculator is still produced. It was introduced in 1981 and is still being made with few changes. The HP 12c featured the [[reverse Polish notation]] mode of data entry. In 2003 several new models were released, including an improved version of the HP 12c, the \"HP 12c platinum edition\" which added more memory, more built-in functions, and the addition of the algebraic mode of data entry.\n\n[[Calculated Industries]] competed with the [[HP-12C|HP 12c]] in the mortgage and real estate markets by differentiating the key labeling; changing the \u201cI\u201d, \u201cPV\u201d, \u201cFV\u201d to easier labeling terms such as \"Int\", \"Term\", \"Pmt\", and not using the [[reverse Polish notation]]. However, CI's more successful calculators involved a line of construction calculators, which evolved and expanded in the 1990s to present. According to Mark Bollman,<ref>{{cite web|author=Mark Bollman |url=http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/Calculators.html |title=Mark->'s Calculator Collection |publisher=Mathcs.albion.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-07-19}}</ref> a mathematics and calculator historian and associate professor of mathematics at Albion College, the \"Construction Master is the first in a long and profitable line of CI construction calculators\" which carried them through the 1980s, 1990s, and to the present.\n\nPersonal computers often come with a calculator utility program that emulates the appearance and functionality of a calculator, using the [[graphical user interface]] to portray a calculator. One such example is [[Calculator (Windows)|Windows Calculator]]. Most [[personal data assistant]]s (PDA) and [[smartphone]]s also have such a feature.\n\n==Use in education==\nIn most countries, [[student]]s use calculators for schoolwork. There was some initial resistance to the idea out of fear that [[Elementary arithmetic|basic arithmetic skills]] would suffer. There remains disagreement about the importance of the ability to perform calculations \"in the head\", with some curricula restricting calculator use until a certain level of proficiency has been obtained, while others concentrate more on teaching [[Approximation|estimation]] techniques and problem-solving. Research suggests that inadequate guidance in the use of calculating tools can restrict the kind of mathematical thinking that students engage in.<ref>Thomas J. Bing, Edward F. Redish, [http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1187 Symbolic Manipulators Affect Mathematical Mindsets], December 1999</ref> Others have argued{{who|date=December 2011}} that calculator use can even cause core mathematical skills to atrophy, or that such use can prevent understanding of advanced algebraic concepts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Calculator Use in Elementary Grades|url=http://www.nctm.org/Standards-and-Positions/Position-Statements/Calculator-Use-in-Elementary-Grades/|website=NCTM|accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref> In December 2011 the [[United Kingdom|UK]]'s [[Department for Education|Minister of State for Schools]], [[Nick Gibb]], voiced concern that children can become \"too dependent\" on the use of calculators.<ref name=\"guardian subtracting calculators\">{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/dec/01/subtracting-calculators-adds-children-maths | title=Subtracting calculators adds to children's maths abilities, says minister | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=December 1, 2011 | accessdate=December 7, 2011 | author=Vasagar, Jeevan | location=London | author2=Shepherd, Jessica | quote=The use of calculators will be looked at as part of a national curriculum review, after the schools minister, Nick Gibb, expressed concern that children's mental and written arithmetic was suffering because of reliance on the devices.

A TI spokesman said that it would actively seek what was due, either in cash or technology cross-licensing agreements. 19 other countries, including the United Kingdom, had already granted a similar patent to Texas Instruments. \u2013 ''New Scientist'', 17 August 1978 p455, and ''Practical Electronics'' (British publication), October 1978 p1094.\n* {{US patent|4001566}} \u2013 ''Floating Point Calculator With RAM Shift Register'' \u2013 1977 (originally filed GB March 1971, US July 1971), very early single chip calculator claim.\n* {{US patent|5623433}} \u2013 ''Extended Numerical Keyboard with Structured Data-Entry Capability'' \u2013 [[Jaime Redin|J.
