The initial detection of radio waves from an astronomical object was made in the 1930s, when [[Karl Jansky]] observed radiation coming from the [[Milky Way]]. Subsequent observations have identified a number of different sources of radio emission. These include [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]], as well as entirely new classes of objects, such as [[Radio galaxy|radio galaxies]], [[quasar]]s, [[pulsar]]s,  and [[Astrophysical maser|masers]]. The discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], regarded as evidence for the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]], was made through radio astronomy.\n\nRadio astronomy is conducted using large [[Antenna (radio)|radio antennas]] referred to as [[radio telescope]]s, that are either used singularly, or with multiple linked telescopes utilizing the techniques of [[Astronomical interferometer|radio interferometry]] and [[aperture synthesis]]. The use of interferometry allows radio astronomy to achieve high [[angular resolution]], as the resolving power of an interferometer is set by the distance between its components, rather than the size of its components.\n\n== History ==\nBefore Jansky observed the Milky Way in the 1930s, physicists speculated that radio waves could be observed from astronomical sources. In the 1860s, [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s [[Maxwell's equations|equations]] had shown that [[electromagnetic radiation]] is associated with [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]], and could exist at any [[wavelength]]. Several attempts were made to detect radio emission from the [[Sun]] including an experiment by German astrophysicists [[Johannes Wilsing]] and [[Julius Scheiner]] in 1896 and a centimeter wave radiation apparatus set up by [[Oliver Lodge]] between 1897-1900. These attempts were unable to detect any emission due to technical limitations of the instruments. The discovery of the radio reflecting [[ionosphere]] in 1902, led physicists to conclude that the layer would bounce any astronomical radio transmission back into space, making them undetectable.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nrao.edu/whatisra/hist_prehist.shtml | title = Pre-History of Radio Astronomy | author = F.

As an engineer with [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]], he was investigating static that interfered with [[short wave]] transatlantic voice transmissions. Using a large [[directional antenna]], Jansky noticed that his [[analog signal|analog]] pen-and-paper recording system kept recording a repeating signal of unknown origin. Since the signal peaked about every 24 hours, Jansky originally suspected the source of the interference was the [[Sun]] crossing the view of his directional antenna. Continued analysis showed that the source was not following the 24-hour daily cycle of the Sun exactly, but instead repeating on a cycle of 23 hours and 56 minutes. Jansky discussed the puzzling phenomena with his friend, astrophysicist and teacher Albert Melvin Skellett, who pointed out that the time between the signal peaks was the exact length of a [[sidereal time|sidereal day]], the time it took for \"fixed\" astronomical objects, such as a star, to passed in front of the antenna every time the Earth rotated.<ref name=\"bookrags.com\">{{cite web | url = http://www.bookrags.com/biography/karl-jansky-wsd/ | title = World of Scientific Discovery on Karl Jansky | accessdate = 2010-04-09}}</ref> By comparing his observations with optical astronomical maps, Jansky eventually concluded that the radiation source peaked when his antenna was aimed at the densest part of the  [[Milky Way]] in the [[constellation]] of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/132066a0 | author = Jansky, Karl G. |  title = Radio waves from outside the solar system | journal = Nature | volume = 132 | issue = 3323 | pages = 66 | date = 1933 | bibcode = 1933Natur.132...66J}}</ref> He concluded that since the Sun (and therefore other stars) were not large emitters of radio noise, the strange radio interference may be generated by interstellar gas and dust in the galaxy.<ref name=\"bookrags.com\"/> (Jansky's peak radio source, one of the brightest in the sky, was designated [[Sagittarius A]] in the 1950s and, instead of being galactic \"gas and dust\", was later hypothesized to be emitted by [[electrons]] in a strong magnetic field.

Byrd [[Green Bank Telescope]] (GBT) in [[West Virginia]], United States is the world's largest fully steerable radio telescope.]]At [[Cambridge University]], where ionospheric research had taken place during [[World War II]], [[J.A. Ratcliffe]] along with other members of the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] that had carried out wartime research into [[radar]], created a radiophysics group at the university where radio wave emissions from the Sun were observed and studied.\nThis early research soon branched out into the observation of other celestial radio sources and interferometry techniques were pioneered to isolate the angular source of the detected emissions. [[Martin Ryle]] and [[Antony Hewish]] at the [[Cavendish Astrophysics Group]] developed the technique of Earth-rotation [[aperture synthesis]]. The radio astronomy group in Cambridge went on to found the [[Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory]] near Cambridge in the 1950s. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, as computers (such as the [[Titan (computer)|Titan]]) became capable of handling the computationally intensive [[Fourier transform]] inversions required, they used aperture synthesis to create a 'One-Mile' and later a '5&nbsp;km' effective aperture using the One-Mile and Ryle telescopes, respectively. They used the [[Cambridge Interferometer]] to map the radio sky, producing the famous [[Second Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources|2C]] and [[Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources|3C]] surveys of radio sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/history/years/radioast.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110022209/http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/history/years/radioast.php|archivedate=2013-11-10|title=Radio Astronomy|publisher=Cambridge University: Department of Physics}}</ref>\n\n==Techniques==\n[[File:First 7-metre ALMA Antenna.jpg|thumb|First 7-metre [[ESO]]/NAOJ/NRAO [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] Antenna.<ref>{{cite news|title=First 7-metre ALMA Antenna Arrives at Chajnantor|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1135a/|accessdate=1 September 2011|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week|date=29 August 2011}}</ref>]]\n\nRadio astronomers use different techniques to observe objects in the radio spectrum. Instruments may simply be pointed at an energetic radio source to analyze its emission. To \u201cimage\u201d a region of the sky in more detail, multiple overlapping scans can be recorded and pieced together in a [[mosaic]] image. The type of instrument used depends on the strength of the signal and the amount of detail needed.\n\nObservations from the [[Earth]]'s surface are limited to wavelengths that can pass through the atmosphere. At low frequencies, or long wavelengths, transmission is limited by the [[ionosphere]], which reflects waves with frequencies less than its characteristic [[plasma frequency]]. [[Water]] [[vapor]] interferes with radio astronomy at higher frequencies, which has led to building radio observatories that conduct observations at [[millimeter]] wavelengths at very high and dry sites, in order to minimize the water vapor content in the line of sight. Finally, transmitting devices on earth may cause [[radio-frequency interference]]. Because of this, many radio observatories are built at remote places.\n\n===Radio telescopes===\n{{Main|Radio telescope}}\n[[File:M87 optical image.jpg|thumb|300px]][[File:M87 VLA VLBA radio astronomy.jpg|thumb|300px| An '''optical''' image of the galaxy [[Messier 87|M87]] ([[Hubble Space Telescope|HST]]), a radio image of same galaxy using '''Interferometry''' ([[Very Large Array]]-'''VLA'''), and an image of the center section ('''VLBA''') using a ''Very Long Baseline Array'' (Global VLBI) consisting of antennas in the US, Germany, Italy, Finland, Sweden and Spain. The jet of particles is suspected to be powered by a [[black hole]] in the center of the galaxy.]]\nRadio telescopes may need to be extremely large in order to receive signals with high [[signal-to-noise ratio]]. Also since [[angular resolution]] is a function of the diameter of the \"[[Objective (optics)|objective]]\" in proportion to the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation being observed,  ''[[radio telescope]]s'' have to be much larger in comparison to their [[Optical telescope|optical]] counterparts. For example, a 1-meter diameter optical telescope is two million times bigger than the wavelength of light observed giving it a resolution of roughly 0.3 [[arc second]]s, whereas a radio telescope \"dish\" many times that size may, depending on the wavelength observed, only be able to resolve an object the size of the full moon (30 minutes of arc).\n\n===Radio interferometry===\n{{main|Astronomical interferometry}}\n{{see also|Radio telescope#Radio interferometry}}\nThe difficulty in achieving high resolutions with single radio telescopes led to radio [[interferometry]], developed by British radio astronomer  [[Martin Ryle]] and Australian engineer, radiophysicist, and radio astronomer [[Joseph Lade Pawsey]] and [[Ruby Payne-Scott]] in 1946. Surprisingly the first use of a radio interferometer for an astronomical observation was carried out by Payne-Scott, Pawsey and [[Lindsay McCready]] on 26 January 1946 using a SINGLE converted radar antenna (broadside array) at [[Very high frequency|200 MHz]] near [[Sydney, Australia]]. This group used the principle of a sea-cliff interferometer in which the antenna (formerly a World War II radar) observed the sun at sunrise with interference arising from the direct radiation from the sun and the reflected radiation from the sea. With this baseline of almost 200 meters, the authors determined that the solar radiation during the burst phase was much smaller than the solar disk and arose from a region associated with a large [[sunspot]] group. The Australia group laid out the principles of [[aperture synthesis]] in a ground-breaking paper published in 1947. The use of a sea-cliff [[interferometer]] had been demonstrated by numerous groups in Australia, Iran and the UK during World War II, who had observed interference fringes (the direct radar return radiation and the reflected signal from the sea) from incoming aircraft.\n \nThe Cambridge group of Ryle and Vonberg observed the sun at 175&nbsp;MHz for the first time in mid July 1946 with a Michelson interferometer consisting of two radio antennas with spacings of some tens of meters up to 240 meters. They showed that the radio radiation was smaller than 10 [[Minute of arc|arc minutes]] in size and also detected circular polarization in the Type I bursts. Two other groups had also detected circular polarization at about the same time ([[David Martyn (scientist)|David Martyn]] in Australia and [[Edward Victor Appleton|Edward Appleton]] with [[James Stanley Hey]] in the UK).\n\nModern [[Radio telescope#Radio interferometry|Radio interferometers]] consist of widely separated radio telescopes observing the same object that are connected together using [[coaxial cable]], [[waveguide]], [[optical fiber]], or other type of [[transmission line]]. This not only increases the total signal collected, it can also be used in a process called [[Aperture synthesis]] to vastly increase resolution. This technique works by superposing (\"[[Interference (wave propagation)|interfering]]\") the signal [[wave]]s from the different telescopes on the principle that [[wave]]s that coincide with the same [[phase (waves)|phase]] will add to each other while two waves that have opposite phases will cancel each other out. This creates a combined telescope that is the size of the antennas furthest apart in the array. In order to produce a high quality image, a large number of different separations between different telescopes are required (the projected separation between any two telescopes as seen from the radio source is called a \"baseline\") - as many different baselines as possible are required in order to get a good quality image. For example, the [[Very Large Array]] has 27 telescopes giving 351 independent baselines at once.\n\n====Very-long-baseline interferometry====\n{{main|Very-long-baseline interferometry}}\n[[File:Mt Pleasant radio telescope night.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory|Mount Pleasant Radio Telescope]] is the southern most antenna used in Australia's VLBI network]]\nBeginning in the 1970s, improvements in the stability of radio telescope receivers permitted telescopes from all over the world (and even in Earth orbit) to be combined to perform [[very-long-baseline interferometry]]. Instead of physically connecting the antennas, data received at each antenna is paired with timing information, usually from a local [[atomic clock]], and then stored for later analysis on magnetic tape or hard disk. At that later time, the data is correlated with data from other antennas similarly recorded, to produce the resulting image. Using this method it is possible to synthesise an antenna that is effectively the size of the Earth. The large distances between the telescopes enable very high angular resolutions to be achieved, much greater in fact than in any other field of astronomy. At the highest frequencies, synthesised beams less than 1 [[Minute of arc|milliarcsecond]] are possible.\n\nThe pre-eminent VLBI arrays operating today are the [[Very Long Baseline Array]] (with telescopes located across North America) and the [[European VLBI Network]] (telescopes in Europe, China, South Africa and Puerto Rico). Each array usually operates separately, but occasional projects are observed together producing increased sensitivity. This is referred to as Global VLBI. There are also a VLBI networks, operating in Australia and New Zealand called the LBA (Long Baseline Array),<ref>http://www.atnf.csiro.au/vlbi/</ref> and arrays in Japan, China and South Korea which observe together to form the East-Asian VLBI Network (EAVN).<ref>http://www.astro.sci.yamaguchi-u.ac.jp/eavn/index.html</ref>\n\nSince its inception, recording data onto hard media was the only way to bring the data recorded at each telescope together for later correlation. However, the availability today of worldwide, high-bandwidth networks makes it possible to do VLBI in real time. This technique (referred to as e-VLBI) was originally pioneered in Japan, and more recently adopted in Australia and in Europe by the EVN (European VLBI Network) who perform an increasing number of scientific e-VLBI projects per year.<ref>[http://www.innovations-report.com/html/reports/physics_astronomy/report-25117.html A technological breakthrough for radio astronomy - Astronomical observations via high-speed data link<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Astronomical sources==\n{{Main|Astronomical radio source}} {{See also|Radio object with continuous optical spectrum}}\n[[File:GCRT J1745-3009 2.jpg|thumb|A radio image of the central region of the Milky Way galaxy.
