It is also the measure of that magnetization.<ref name=Chikazumi>{{Harvnb|Chikazumi|1997}}</ref> Colloquially, when a magnet is \"magnetized\" it has remanence.<ref>Strictly speaking, it is still in the Earth's field, but that has little effect on the remanence of a [[hard magnet]].</ref>  The remanence of magnetic materials provides the magnetic memory in [[magnetic storage]] devices, and is used as a source of information on the past Earth's magnetic field in [[paleomagnetism]].\n\nThe equivalent term  '''residual magnetization''' is generally used in engineering applications. In [[transformer]]s, [[electric motors]] and [[Electric generator|generators]] a large residual magnetization is not desirable (see also [[electrical steel]]) as it is an unwanted contamination, for example a magnetization remaining in an [[electromagnet]] after the current in the coil is turned off. Where it is unwanted, it can be removed by [[degaussing]].\n\nSometimes the term '''retentivity''' is used for remanence measured in units of [[magnetic flux density]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Magnetic Tape Storage and Handling|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub54/glossary.html}}</ref>\n\n==Types of remanence==\n===Saturation remanence===\n[[Image:B-H loop.png|thumb|'''Fig. 1''' A family of AC [[hysteresis]] loops for grain-oriented electrical steel ('''''B'''''<sub>r</sub> denotes ''remanence'' and '''''H'''''<sub>c</sub> is the ''[[coercivity]]'').]]\nThe default definition of magnetic remanence is the magnetization remaining in zero field after a large magnetic field is applied (enough to achieve [[saturation (magnetic)|saturation]]).<ref name=Chikazumi/> The effect of a magnetic [[hysteresis loop]] is measured using instruments such as a [[vibrating sample magnetometer]]; and the zero-field intercept is a measure of the remanence. In [[physics]] this measure is converted to an average [[magnetization]] (the total [[magnetic moment]] divided by the volume of the sample) and denoted in equations as '''''M'''''<sub>r</sub>. If it must be distinguished from other kinds of remanence, then it is called the ''saturation remanence'' or ''saturation isothermal remanence (SIRM)'' and denoted by '''''M'''''<sub>rs</sub>.\n\nIn engineering applications the residual magnetization is often measured using a [[B-H Analyzer]], which measures the response to an AC magnetic field  (as in Fig. 1). This is represented by a [[flux density]] '''''B'''''<sub>r</sub>. This value of remanence is one of the most important parameters characterizing [[permanent magnet]]s; it measures the strongest magnetic field they can produce. [[Neodymium magnets]], for example, have a remanence approximately equal to 1.3 [[tesla (unit)|teslas]].\n\n=== Isothermal remanence ===\nOften a single measure of remanence does not provide adequate information on a magnet. For example, magnetic tapes contain a large number of small magnetic particles (see [[magnetic storage]]), and these particles are not identical.  Magnetic minerals in rocks may have a wide range of magnetic properties (see [[rock magnetism]]). One way to look inside these materials is to add or subtract small increments of remanence. One way of doing this is first [[Magnet#Magnetization and demagnetization|demagnetizing]] the magnet in an AC field, and then applying a field '''''H''''' and removing it.  This remanence, denoted by '''''M'''''<sub>r</sub>('''''H'''''), depends on the field.<ref name=Wohlfarth>{{Harvnb|Wohlfarth|1958}}</ref> It is called the ''initial remanence''<ref>{{Harvnb|McCurrie|Gaunt|1966}}</ref> or the ''isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM)''.<ref name=N\u00e9el>{{Harvnb|N\u00e9el|1955}}</ref>\n\nAnother kind of IRM can be obtained by first giving the magnet a saturation remanence in one direction and then applying and removing a magnetic field in the opposite direction.<ref name=Wohlfarth/>  This is called ''demagnetization remanence'' or ''DC demagnetization remanence'' and is denoted by symbols like '''''M'''''<sub>d</sub>('''''H'''''), where '''''H''''' is the ''magnitude'' of the field.<ref name=Pfeiffer>{{Harvnb|Pfeiffer|1990}}</ref>  Yet another kind of remanence can be obtained by demagnetizing the saturation remanence in an ac field.  This is called ''AC demagnetization remanence'' or ''alternating field demagnetization remanence'' and is denoted by symbols like '''''M'''''<sub>af</sub>('''''H''''').\n\nIf the particles are noninteracting single-domain particles with uniaxial anisotropy, there are simple linear relations between the remanences.<ref name=Wohlfarth/>\n\n=== Anhysteretic remanence ===\nAnother kind of laboratory remanence is ''anhysteretic remanence'' or ''anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM)''. This is induced by exposing a magnet to a large alternating field plus a small dc bias field. The amplitude of the alternating field is gradually reduced to zero to get an ''anhysteretic magnetization'', and then the bias field is removed to get the remanence. The anhysteretic magnetization curve is often close to an average of the two branches of the [[hysteresis loop]],<ref name=Bozorth>{{Harvnb|Bozorth|1951}}</ref> and is assumed in some models to represent the lowest-energy state for a given field.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jiles|Atherton|1986}}</ref> ARM has also been studied because of its similarity to the write process in some magnetic recording technology<ref>{{Harvnb|Jaep|1969}}</ref> and to the acquisition of [[natural remanent magnetization]] in rocks.<ref>{{Harvnb|Banerjee|Mellema|1974}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n{{expand section|date=September 2016}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
