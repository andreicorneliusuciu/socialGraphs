This mailing list service was known as Listserv@Bitnic (also known as LISTSERV@BITNIC) and quickly became a key service on the [[BITNET]] network. It provided functionality similar to a UNIX [[Sendmail]] alias and, as with Sendmail, subscriptions were managed manually.\n\nIn 1986, \u00c9ric Thomas developed an independent application, originally named \"Revised Listserv\" (also known as \"Revised LISTSERV\"), which was the first automated mailing list management application. Prior to Revised Listserv, email lists were managed manually. To join or leave a list, people would write to the human list administrator and ask to be added or removed, a process that only got more time-consuming as discussion lists grew in popularity.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://peach.ease.lsoft.com/scripts/wa.exe?A0=LSTSRV-L | title=Unedited archives of LSTSRV-L, LISTSERV site administrators' forum, July 1986\u2013}}</ref>\n\nBy 1987, the users of the Bitnic Listserv had migrated to Thomas' version.\n\nListserv was freeware from 1986 through 1993 and is now a commercial product developed by L-Soft, a company founded by Listserv author \u00c9ric Thomas in 1994.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/TECH/industry/10/30/fsecure.email.idg/index.html | title=Costello Sam. \"E-mail lists get virus protection\", ''CNN.com, Sci-Tech'', October 30, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lsoft.com/corporate/ericthomas_cv.asp | title=CV of \u00c9ric Thomas}}</ref>  A free version limited to ten lists of up to 500 subscribers each can be downloaded from the company's web site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lsoft.com/download/listservfree.asp |title=L-Soft web page with download links for the free version,  ''LISTSERV Lite Free''|accessdate=12 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nSeveral other list management tools were subsequently developed, such as [[Lyris ListManager]] in 1997, [[Sympa]] in 1997, [[GNU Mailman]] in 1998.\n\n== Automated mailing list management ==\nIn 1986, \u00c9ric Thomas invented the concept of an automated mailing list manager. Whilst a student at [[\u00c9cole Centrale Paris|Ecole Centrale Paris]], he developed the software now known as LISTSERV.<ref name=history /> Some of the early software features allowed joining or leaving a list without the need for human administration. Also, the list owner could add or remove subscribers, and edit templates for both welcome and system messages. Amongst other innovations LISTSERV introduced double opt-in in 1993 and the first spam filter in 1995.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lsoft.com/corporate/history_listserv.asp | title=Listserv product history timeline}}</ref>\n\nAfter the release of Thomas' LISTSERV in 1986, LISTSERV@BITNIC was enhanced to provide automatic list management, but was abandoned a few months later when Bitnic installed Thomas' LISTSERV.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.listserv.dfn.de/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind8701&L=NODMGT-L&P=R2&I=-3 | title=Bitnet Network Information Center announcement by Judith Molka on the NODMGT-L List, January 7, 1987}}</ref>\n\nOther than their name, Bitnic's and Thomas' products are unrelated and neither product is based on the other product's code.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lsoft.com/products/listserv-history.asp | title=History of LISTSERV@BITNIC and LISTSERV email list management software, 1985\u20131995}}</ref>\n\nThough [[electronic mailing lists]] (also known as \"email lists\") are not as popular as they once were, they continue to be used today due to their ease of use.<ref name=\"spectrum\"/>\n\n== Trademark ==\nLISTSERV was registered as a trademark with the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] in 1995, based on its use since 1986.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=registration&entry=2001258 | title=LISTSERV Trademark Registration at USPTO}}</ref>  It was registered with the Swedish Patent and Registration Office, [[Swedish Patent and Registration Office|PRV]], in 2001.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.prv.se/ | title=PRV, the Swedish Patent and Registration Office}}</ref> As such, in those jurisdictions, using the word \"listserv\" to describe a different product or as a generic term for any email-based mailing list of that kind is a trademark misuse. The standard generic terms are ''electronic mailing list'', elist, or ''email list'' for the list itself, and ''email list manager'' or ''email list software'' for the software product that manages the list.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lsoft.com/corporate/trademark.asp | title=LISTSERV trademark information}}</ref>  Nevertheless, the generic use of the term has been common at times.<ref name=\"spectrum\">{{cite journal|last=Lambert|first=Greg|date=June 2009|title=Where Do Listservs Fit in a Social Media World?: The networking tool of the 90s is starting to show its age|journal=AALL Spectrum|pages=8,9,13|url=http://www.aallnet.org/main-menu/Publications/spectrum/Archives/Vol-13/pub_sp0906/pub-sp0906-listservs.pdf|volume=13}}</ref>\n\n== Security ==\nThrough version 15.0, individual user [[password]]s were stored in the clear, and available to users who are listed as Site Managers or \"Postmasters\" in the application configuration, thus allowing unethical managers, or attackers who compromise the site, to easily try to reuse the username and password on other sites. Passwords are hashed to protect against this since version 15.5, which was released in 2007.<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.lsoft.com/manuals/15.5/htmlhelp/what's%20new/WhatsNew.3.1.html\n | title=What\u2019s New for LISTSERV\n | work=\n | author=\n | date=2007\n | accessdate=2012-03-08 }}\n</ref>\n\n== Editions ==\nLISTSERV is available in several licensing options: LISTSERV Lite Free Edition for non-commercial hobby use; LISTSERV Lite for smaller workloads; LISTSERV, the standard, full-featured version; LISTSERV HPO (High Performance Option); and LISTSERV Maestro (for customized and targeted email publishing and reporting).\n\n== Supported operating systems ==\nA list of currently-supported operating systems can be found at http://lsoft.com/products/listserv_os.asp\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Internet}}\n* [[Regroup]]\n* [[Majordomo (software)]]\n* [[Massively distributed collaboration]]\n* [[GNU Mailman]]\n* [[Sympa]]\n* [[Dada Mail]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.lsoft.com/products/listserv.asp LISTSERV product information on L-Soft's Web site]\n\n[[Category:Mailing list software]]\n[[Category:Internet protocols]]\n[[Category:Internet Standards]]\n[[Category:Internet Protocol based network software]]\n[[Category:Email]]"}]}}}}
