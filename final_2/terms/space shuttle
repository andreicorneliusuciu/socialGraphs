Two crew members, the commander and pilot, were sufficient for a minimal flight, as in the first four \"test\" flights, STS-1 through STS-4. The typical payload capacity was about {{convert|50045|lb|kg|sigfig=3|sp=us}} but could be increased depending on the choice of launch configuration. The orbiter carried its payload in a large cargo bay with doors that opened along the length of its top, a feature which made the Space Shuttle unique among spacecraft. This feature made possible the deployment of large satellites such as the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and also the capture and return of large payloads back to Earth.\n\nWhen the orbiter's space mission was complete, it fired its OMS thrusters to drop out of orbit and re-enter the lower atmosphere.<ref name=\"atmos\"/> During descent, the orbiter passed through different layers of the atmosphere and decelerated from [[hypersonic]] speed primarily by [[aerobraking]]. In the lower atmosphere and landing phase, it was more like a [[Glider aircraft|glider]] but with [[reaction control system]] (RCS) thrusters and [[fly-by-wire]]-controlled hydraulically actuated flight surfaces controlling its descent. It landed on a long runway as a conventional aircraft. The aerodynamic shape was a compromise between the demands of radically different speeds and air pressures during re-entry, hypersonic flight, and subsonic atmospheric flight. As a result, the orbiter had a relatively high [[sink rate]] at low altitudes, and it transitioned during re-entry from using RCS thrusters at very high altitudes to flight surfaces in the lower atmosphere.\n\n==Early history==\n{{Further|Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle design process}}\n[[File:President Nixon and James Fletcher Discuss the Space Shuttle - GPN-2002-000109.jpg|thumb|right|President Nixon (right) with [[NASA Administrator]] [[James&nbsp;C. Fletcher|Fletcher]] in January 1972, three months before Congress approved funding for the Shuttle program]]\n\nThe formal design of what became the Space Shuttle began with the \"Phase A\" contract design studies issued in the late 1960s. Conceptualization [[Space Shuttle design process|had begun two decades earlier]], before the [[Apollo program]] of the 1960s. One of the places the concept of a spacecraft returning from space to a horizontal landing originated was within [[NACA]], in 1954, in the form of an [[aeronautics]] research experiment later named the [[North American X-15|X-15]]. The NACA proposal was submitted by [[Walter Dornberger]].\n\nIn 1958, the X-15 concept further developed into proposal to launch an X-15 into space, and another [[X-plane|X-series]] [[spaceplane]] proposal, named [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]], as well as variety of aerospace plane concepts and studies. [[Neil Armstrong]] was selected to pilot both the X-15 and the X-20. Though the X-20 was not built, another spaceplane similar to the X-20 was built several years later and delivered to NASA in January 1966 called the [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] (\"HL\" indicated \"horizontal landing\").\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the [[US Air Force]] conducted classified [[North American DC-3#History|studies]] on next-generation space transportation systems and concluded that semi-reusable designs were the cheapest choice. It proposed a development program with an immediate start on a \"Class&nbsp;I\" vehicle with expendable boosters, followed by slower development of a \"Class&nbsp;II\" semi-reusable design and possible \"Class&nbsp;III\" fully reusable design later. In 1967, [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]] held a one-day symposium at NASA headquarters to study the options. Eighty people attended and presented a wide variety of designs, including earlier US Air Force designs such as the X-20 Dyna-Soar.\n\nIn 1968, NASA officially began work on what was then known as the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV). At the same time, NASA held a separate Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) competition. NASA offices in [[Houston]] and [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] jointly issued a [[Request for Proposal]] (RFP) for ILRV studies to design a spacecraft that could deliver a payload to orbit but also re-enter the atmosphere and fly back to Earth. For example, one of the responses was for a two-stage design, featuring a large booster and a small orbiter, called the [[North American DC-3|DC-3]], one of several Phase A Shuttle designs. After the aforementioned \"Phase A\" studies, B, C, and D phases progressively evaluated in-depth designs up to 1972. In the final design, the bottom stage was recoverable solid rocket boosters, and the top stage used an expendable external tank.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web|url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=INTRODUCTION TO FUTURE LAUNCH VEHICLE PLANS [1963\u20132001&#93; Updated 6/15/2001, by Marcus Lindroos |publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=2012-04-17}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, President [[Richard Nixon]] decided to [[Space Shuttle design process#Decision-making process|support proceeding]] with Space Shuttle development. A series of development programs and analysis refined the basic design, prior to full development and testing. In August 1973, the [[Martin-Marietta X-24B|X-24B]] proved that an unpowered spaceplane could re-enter Earth's atmosphere for a horizontal landing.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, European ministers met in Belgium in 1973 to authorize Western Europe's manned orbital project and its main contribution to Space Shuttle{{mdash}}the [[Spacelab]] program.<ref name=\"sl98\"/> Spacelab would provide a multidisciplinary orbital space laboratory and additional space equipment for the Shuttle.<ref name=\"sl98\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Columbia STS-1 arrival at launch pad.jpg|thumb|right|STS-1 on the launch pad, December 1980]]\n\nThe Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for [[Reusable launch system|reuse]]. It carried different payloads to low Earth orbit, provided crew rotation and supplies for the [[International Space Station]] (ISS), and performed satellite servicing and repair. The orbiter could also recover satellites and other payloads from orbit and return them to Earth. Each Shuttle was designed for a projected lifespan of 100 launches or ten years of operational life, although this was later extended. The person in charge of designing the STS was [[Maxime Faget]], who had also overseen the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], and [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo]] spacecraft designs. The crucial factor in the size and shape of the Shuttle orbiter was the requirement that it be able to accommodate the largest planned commercial and military satellites, and have over 1,000 mile cross-range recovery range to meet the requirement for classified USAF missions for a once-around abort from a launch to a [[polar orbit]]. The militarily specified {{convert|1,085|nmi|abbr=on}} cross range requirement was one of the primary reasons for the Shuttle's large wings, compared to modern commercial designs with very minimal control surfaces and glide capability. Factors involved in opting for solid rockets and an expendable fuel tank included the desire of the Pentagon to obtain a high-capacity payload vehicle for satellite deployment, and the desire of the Nixon administration to reduce the costs of [[space exploration]] by developing a spacecraft with reusable components.\n\nEach Space Shuttle was a [[reusable launch system]] composed of three main assemblies: the reusable OV, the expendable ET, and the two reusable SRBs.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/returntoflight/system/system_STS.html Shuttle Basics]. NASA.</ref> Only the OV entered orbit shortly after the tank and boosters are jettisoned. The vehicle was launched vertically like a conventional rocket, and the orbiter glided to a horizontal landing like an airplane, after which it was refurbished for reuse.

The Kennedy Space Center was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for equatorial orbits (the only orbit profile actually used in the program), the US Air Force at the [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for polar orbits (though this was never used), the [[Johnson Space Center]] served as the central point for all Shuttle operations, the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] was responsible for the main engines, external tank, and solid rocket boosters, the [[John C.

This means no mechanical or hydraulic linkages connected the pilot's control stick to the control surfaces or reaction control system thrusters. The control algorithm, which used a classical [[PID controller|Proportional Integral Derivative]] (PID) approach, was developed and maintained by [[Honeywell]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} The Shuttle's [[fly-by-wire]] digital [[flight control system]] was composed of 4 control systems each addressing a different mission phase: Ascent, Descent, On-Orbit and Aborts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Honeywell is also credited with the design and implementation of the Shuttle's Nose Wheel Steering Control Algorithm that allowed the Orbiter to safely land at Kennedy Space Center's Shuttle Runway.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nA concern with using digital fly-by-wire systems on the Shuttle was reliability. Considerable research went into the Shuttle computer system. The Shuttle used five identical redundant IBM 32-bit general purpose computers (GPCs), model [[IBM AP-101|AP-101]], constituting a type of [[embedded system]]. Four computers ran specialized software called the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS). A fifth backup computer ran separate software called the Backup Flight System (BFS). Collectively they were called the Data Processing System (DPS).<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web|publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design|url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html|title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

The surface of the vehicle is colored by the pressure coefficient, and the gray contours represent the density of the surrounding air, as calculated using the [[Overflow (software)|OVERFLOW]] software package.]]\n\nThe design goal of the Shuttle's DPS was fail-operational/fail-safe reliability. After a single failure, the Shuttle could still continue the mission. After two failures, it could still land safely.\n\nThe four general-purpose computers operated essentially in lockstep, checking each other. If one computer provided a different result than the other three (i.e. the one computer failed), the three functioning computers \"voted\" it out of the system. This isolated it from vehicle control. If a second computer of the three remaining failed, the two functioning computers voted it out. A very unlikely failure mode would have been where two of the computers produced result A, and two produced result B (a two-two split). In this unlikely case, one group of two was to be picked at random.\n\nThe Backup Flight System (BFS) was separately developed software running on the fifth computer, used only if the entire four-computer primary system failed. The BFS was created because although the four primary computers were hardware redundant, they all ran the same software, so a generic software problem could crash all of them. Embedded system [[Avionics|avionic]] software was developed under totally different conditions from public commercial software: the number of code lines was tiny compared to a public commercial software product, changes were only made infrequently and with extensive testing, and many programming and test personnel worked on the small amount of computer code. However, in theory it could have still failed, and the BFS existed for that contingency. While the BFS could run in parallel with PASS, the BFS never engaged to take over control from PASS during any Shuttle mission.\n\nThe software for the Shuttle computers was written in a high-level language called [[HAL/S]], somewhat similar to [[PL/I]]. It is specifically designed for a [[Real-time computing|real time]] embedded system environment.\n\nThe IBM AP-101 computers originally had about 424 kilobytes of [[magnetic core memory]] each. The CPU could process about 400,000 instructions per second. They had no hard disk drive, and loaded software from magnetic tape cartridges.\n\nIn 1990, the original computers were replaced with an upgraded model AP-101S, which had about 2.5 times the memory capacity (about 1 megabyte) and three times the processor speed (about 1.2&nbsp;million instructions per second). The memory was changed from magnetic core to semiconductor with battery backup.\n\nEarly Shuttle missions, starting in November 1983, took along the [[Grid Compass]], arguably one of the first laptop computers. The GRiD was given the name SPOC, for Shuttle Portable Onboard Computer. Use on the Shuttle required both hardware and software modifications which were incorporated into later versions of the commercial product. It was used to monitor and display the Shuttle's ground position, path of the next two orbits, show where the Shuttle had line of sight communications with ground stations, and determine points for location-specific observations of the Earth. The Compass sold poorly, as it cost at least US$8000, but it offered unmatched performance for its weight and size.<ref name=\"GRiD\">{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/events/index.php?id=1139464298 |title=Pioneering the Laptop:Engineering the GRiD Compass |accessdate=October 25, 2007 |publisher=The Computer History Museum|year=2006 |author=The Computer History Museum}}</ref> NASA was one of its main customers.<ref name=\"GRiDNASA\">{{cite web|url=http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20020090827_2002146711.pdf|title=Portable Compute |accessdate=June 23, 2010 |publisher=NASA |year=1985 |author=NASA}}</ref>\n\nDuring its service life, the Shuttle's Control System never experienced a failure. Many of the lessons learned have been used to design today's high speed control algorithms.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n===Orbiter markings and insignia===\n[[File:NASA-MHughes-Fulford.JPG|thumb|Payload specialist [[Millie Hughes-Fulford]], who flew aboard ''Columbia'' in 1991, displays the modernist Blackburn & Danne NASA logotype, known as \"the worm\".]]\n\nThe prototype orbiter ''Enterprise'' originally had a [[flag of the United States]] on the upper surface of the left wing and the letters \"USA\" in black on the right wing. The name \"Enterprise\" was painted in black on the payload bay doors just above the hinge and behind the crew module; on the aft end of the payload bay doors was the [[NASA insignia|NASA \"worm\" logotype]] in gray. Underneath the rear of the payload bay doors on the side of the fuselage just above the wing is the text \"United States\" in black with a flag of the United States ahead of it.\n\nThe first operational orbiter, ''Columbia'', originally had the same markings as ''Enterprise'', although the letters \"USA\" on the right wing were slightly larger and spaced farther apart. ''Columbia'' also had black markings which ''Enterprise'' lacked on its forward RCS module, around the cockpit windows, and on its vertical stabilizer, and had distinctive black \"chines\" on the forward part of its upper wing surfaces, which none of the other orbiters had.\n\n''Challenger'' established a modified marking scheme for the shuttle fleet that was matched by ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'' and ''Endeavour''. The letters \"USA\" in black above an American flag were displayed on the left wing, with the NASA \"worm\" logotype in gray centered above the name of the orbiter in black on the right wing. The name of the orbiter was inscribed not on the payload bay doors, but on the forward fuselage just below and behind the cockpit windows. This would make the name visible when the shuttle was photographed in orbit with the doors open.\n\nIn 1983, ''Enterprise'' had its wing markings changed to match ''Challenger'', and the NASA \"worm\" logotype on the aft end of the payload bay doors was changed from gray to black. Some black markings were added to the nose, cockpit windows and vertical tail to more closely resemble the flight vehicles, but the name \"Enterprise\" remained on the payload bay doors as there was never any need to open them. ''Columbia'' had its name moved to the forward fuselage to match the other flight vehicles after [[STS-61-C]], during the 1986\u201388 hiatus when the shuttle fleet was grounded following the [[Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], but retained its original wing markings until its last overhaul (after [[STS-93]]), and its unique black wing \"chines\" for the remainder of its operational life.\n\nBeginning in 1998, the flight vehicles' markings were modified to incorporate the NASA [[NASA insignia|\"meatball\" insignia]]. The \"worm\" logotype, which the agency had phased out, was removed from the payload bay doors and the \"meatball\" insignia was added aft of the \"United States\" text on the lower aft fuselage. The \"meatball\" insignia was also displayed on the left wing, with the American flag above the orbiter's name, left-justified rather than centered, on the right wing. The three surviving flight vehicles, ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'' and ''Endeavour'', still bear these markings as museum displays. ''Enterprise'' became the property of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1985 and was no longer under NASA's control when these changes were made, hence the prototype orbiter still has its 1983 markings and still has its name on the payload bay doors.\n\n===Upgrades===\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].

Internally, the Shuttle remained largely similar to the original design, with the exception of the improved avionics computers. In addition to the computer upgrades, the original analog primary flight instruments were replaced with modern full-color, flat-panel display screens, called a [[glass cockpit]], which is similar to those of contemporary airliners. To facilitate construction of ISS, the internal airlocks of each orbiter except ''Columbia''<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ray|first1=Justin|title=Flying into the future|website=http://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/features/000414overhaul/future.html|publisher=Spaceflight Now|accessdate=July 2014}}</ref> were replaced with external docking systems to allow for a greater amount of cargo to be stored on the Shuttle's mid-deck during station resupply missions.\n\nThe Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) had several improvements to enhance reliability and power. This explains phrases such as \"Main engines throttling up to 104 percent.\" This did not mean the engines were being run over a safe limit. The 100 percent figure was the original specified power level. During the lengthy development program, [[Rocketdyne]] determined the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104 percent of the originally specified thrust. NASA could have rescaled the output number, saying in essence 104 percent is now 100 percent. To clarify this would have required revising much previous documentation and software, so the 104 percent number was retained. SSME upgrades were denoted as \"block numbers\", such as block I, block II, and block IIA. The upgrades improved engine reliability, maintainability and performance. The 109% thrust level was finally reached in flight hardware with the Block II engines in 2001. The normal maximum throttle was 104 percent, with 106 percent or 109 percent used for mission aborts.\n\nFor the first two missions, STS-1 and [[STS-2]], the external tank was painted white to protect the insulation that covers much of the tank, but improvements and testing showed that it was not required. The weight saved by not painting the tank resulted in an increase in payload capability to orbit.<ref name=\"aerospaceweb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/spacecraft/q0285.shtml|title=Space Shuttle External Tank Foam Insulation |accessdate=October 25, 2007 |publisher=Aerospaceweb.org |year=2006 |author=Aerospaceweb.org}}</ref> Additional weight was saved by removing some of the internal \"stringers\" in the hydrogen tank that proved unnecessary.

[[STS-91]] saw the first flight of the \"super light-weight external tank\". This version of the tank was made of the 2195 aluminum-lithium alloy. It weighed 3.4 metric tons (7,500&nbsp;lb) less than the last run of lightweight tanks, allowing the Shuttle to deliver heavy elements to ISS's high inclination orbit.<ref name=toba/> As the Shuttle was always operated with a crew, each of these improvements was first flown on operational mission flights.\n\nThe solid rocket boosters underwent improvements as well. Design engineers added a third [[O-ring]] seal to the joints between the segments after the 1986 Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster.\n\n[[File:SSME1.jpg|thumb|upright|The three nozzles of the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]] with the two [[Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) pods, and the [[vertical stabilizer]] above.]]\n\nSeveral other SRB improvements were planned to improve performance and safety, but never came to be. These culminated in the considerably simpler, lower cost, probably safer and better-performing [[Advanced Solid Rocket Booster]].

It was called the [[Shuttle-C]], and would have traded re-usability for cargo capability, with large potential savings from reusing technology developed for the Space Shuttle.

From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets were worn. A less-bulky, partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet was reinstated when Shuttle flights resumed in 1988. The Launch-Entry Suit ended its service life in late 1995, and was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which resembled the [[Gemini space suit]] in design, but retained the orange color of the Launch-Entry Suit.\n\nTo extend the duration that orbiters could stay docked at the ISS, the [[Station-to-Shuttle Power Transfer System]] (SSPTS) was installed. The SSPTS allowed these orbiters to use power provided by the ISS to preserve their consumables. The SSPTS was first used successfully on [[STS-118]].\n\n===Specifications===\n{{anchor|Technical data}}[[File:Space Shuttle Orbiter-Illustration.jpg|thumb|right|Space Shuttle orbiter illustration]]\n[[File:Pl\u00e1nik orbitera 2.JPG|thumb|Space Shuttle drawing]]\n[[File:Shuttle Left Wing Cutaway Diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Space Shuttle wing cutaway]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle vs Soyuz TM - to scale drawing.png|thumb|Space Shuttle Orbiter and [[Soyuz-TM]] (drawn to scale).]]\n[[File:Space shuttles Atlantis (STS-125) and Endeavour (STS-400) on launch pads.jpg|thumb|''Atlantis'' and ''Endeavour'' on launch pads.

Like most jet airliners, the Shuttle was mainly constructed of conductive aluminum, which would normally shield and protect the internal systems. However, upon liftoff the Shuttle sent out a long exhaust plume as it ascended, and this plume could have triggered lightning by providing a current path to ground.

Its flight software, designed in the 1970s, was not designed for this, and would require the orbiter's computers be reset through a change of year, which could cause a glitch while in orbit. In 2007, NASA engineers devised a solution so Shuttle flights could cross the year-end boundary.<ref name=\"YERO\">{{cite web |last=Bergin |first=Chris |title=NASA solves YERO problem for Shuttle |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=5026 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418182718/http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=5026 |archivedate=April 18, 2008 |date= February 19, 2007 |accessdate=December 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Launch===\nAfter the final hold in the countdown at T-minus 9 minutes, the Shuttle went through its final preparations for launch, and the countdown was automatically controlled by the Ground Launch Sequencer (GLS), software at the Launch Control Center, which stopped the count if it sensed a critical problem with any of the Shuttle's onboard systems. The GLS handed off the count to the Shuttle's on-board computers at T minus 31 seconds, in a process called auto sequence start.\n\nAt T-minus 16 seconds, the massive sound suppression system (SPS) began to drench the [[Mobile Launcher Platform]] (MLP) and SRB trenches with {{convert|300000|USgal|m3|sigfig=2}} of water to protect the Orbiter from damage by [[acoustical]] energy and rocket exhaust reflected from the flame trench and MLP during lift off.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/sound-suppression-system.html NASA article]</ref><ref name=\"sps\">National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Failure to burn these gases could trip the onboard sensors and create the possibility of an overpressure and explosion of the vehicle during the firing phase. The main engine turbopumps also began charging the combustion chambers with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen at this time. The computers reciprocated this action by allowing the redundant computer systems to begin the firing phase.\n\n[[File:020408 STS110 Atlantis launch.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Space Shuttle Main Engine ignition]]\n\nThe three main engines (SSMEs) started at ''T''-6.6 seconds. The main engines ignited sequentially via the Shuttle's general purpose computers (GPCs) at 120 millisecond intervals. All three SSMEs were required to reach 90% rated thrust within three seconds, otherwise the onboard computers would initiate an [[RSLS Abort|RSLS abort]]. If all three engines indicated nominal performance by ''T''-3 seconds, they were commanded to gimbal to liftoff configuration and the command would be issued to arm the SRBs for ignition at ''T''-0.<ref name=\"countdown101\">National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

The three second delay after confirmation of SSME operation was to allow the stack to return to nearly vertical. At ''T''-0 seconds, the 8 [[Pyrotechnic fastener|frangible nuts]] holding the SRBs to the pad were detonated, the SSMEs were commanded to 100% throttle, and the SRBs were ignited. By ''T''+0.23 seconds, the SRBs built up enough thrust for liftoff to commence, and reached maximum chamber pressure by ''T''+0.6 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |title=Shuttle Crew Operations Manual |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/390651main_shuttle_crew_operations_manual.pdf |website=nasa.gov |accessdate=February 2015}}</ref> The [[Johnson Space Center]]'s [[Mission Control Center]] assumed control of the flight once the SRBs had cleared the launch tower.\n\nShortly after liftoff, the Shuttle's main engines were throttled up to 104.5% and the vehicle began a combined roll, pitch and yaw maneuver that placed it onto the correct heading (azimuth) for the planned orbital inclination and in a heads down attitude with wings level. The Shuttle flew upside down during the ascent phase. This orientation allowed a trim angle of attack that was favorable for aerodynamic loads during the region of high dynamic pressure, resulting in a net positive load factor, as well as providing the flight crew with a view of the horizon as a visual reference. The vehicle climbed in a progressively flattening arc, accelerating as the mass of the SRBs and main tank decreased. To achieve low orbit requires much more horizontal than vertical acceleration. This was not visually obvious, since the vehicle rose vertically and was out of sight for most of the horizontal acceleration. The near circular orbital velocity at the {{convert|380|km|mi|sigfig=3|sp=us}} altitude of the International Space Station is {{convert|27650|km/h|mph|abbr=on|sigfig=4|sp=us}}, roughly equivalent to Mach 23 at sea level. As the International Space Station orbits at an inclination of 51.6 degrees, missions going there must set orbital inclination to the same value in order to rendezvous with the station.\n\nAround 30 seconds into ascent, the SSMEs were throttled down\u2014usually to 72%, though this varied\u2014to reduce the maximum aerodynamic forces acting on the Shuttle at a point called [[Max Q]]. Additionally, the propellant grain design of the SRBs caused their thrust to drop by about 30% by 50 seconds into ascent. Once the Orbiter's guidance verified that Max Q would be within Shuttle structural limits, the main engines were throttled back up to 104.5%; this throttling down and back up was called the \"thrust bucket\". To maximize performance, the throttle level and timing of the thrust bucket was shaped to bring the Shuttle as close to aerodynamic limits as possible.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aerodynamics and Flight  Dynamics|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/584730main_Wings-ch4d-pgs226-241.pdf|website=www.nasa.gov|accessdate=February 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:STS-1 The Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters break away from Columbia's External Tank.jpg|thumb|right|Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) separation during STS-1. The white external tank pictured was used on STS-1 and STS-2.]]\n\nAt around ''T''+126 seconds, [[pyrotechnic fastener]]s released the SRBs and small separation rockets pushed them laterally away from the vehicle. The SRBs parachuted back to the ocean to be reused. The Shuttle then began accelerating to orbit on the main engines. Acceleration at this point would typically fall to .9 ''[[g-force|g]]'', and the vehicle would take on a somewhat nose-up angle to the horizon{{spaced ndash}}it used the main engines to gain and then maintain altitude while it accelerated horizontally towards orbit. At about five and three-quarter minutes into ascent, the orbiter's direct communication links with the ground began to fade, at which point it rolled heads up to reroute its communication links to the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite]] system.\n\nAt about seven and a half minutes into ascent, the mass of the vehicle was low enough that the engines had to be throttled back to limit vehicle acceleration to 3 ''g'' (29.4&nbsp;m/s\u00b2 or 96.5&nbsp;ft/s\u00b2, equivalent to accelerating from zero to {{convert|105.9|km/h|mph|abbr=on|}} in a second). The Shuttle would maintain this acceleration for the next minute, and main engine cut-off (MECO) occurred at about eight and a half minutes after launch.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ascent Timeline and Abort Boundaries - STS-135 |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts135/fdf/135ascent.html |website=SpaceflightNow |accessdate=February 2015}}</ref> The main engines were shut down before complete depletion of propellant, as running dry would have destroyed the engines. The oxygen supply was terminated before the hydrogen supply, as the SSMEs reacted unfavorably to other shutdown modes. (Liquid oxygen has a tendency to react violently, and supports combustion when it encounters hot engine metal.) A few seconds after MECO, the external tank was released by firing pyrotechnic fasteners.\n\nAt this point the Shuttle and external tank were on a slightly suborbital trajectory, coasting up towards [[apogee]]. Once at apogee, about half an hour after MECO, the Shuttle's [[Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines were fired to raise its [[perigee]] and achieve orbit, while the external tank fell back into the atmosphere and burned up over the Indian Ocean or the Pacific Ocean depending on launch profile.<ref name=\"tech\" />  The sealing action of the tank plumbing and lack of pressure relief systems on the external tank helped it break up in the lower atmosphere. After the foam burned away during re-entry, the heat caused a pressure buildup in the remaining liquid oxygen and hydrogen until the tank exploded. This ensured that any pieces that fell back to Earth were small.\n\n====Ascent tracking====\n[[File:Contraves-Goerz Kineto Tracking Mount.jpeg|thumb|Contraves-Goerz Kineto Tracking Mount used to image the space Shuttle during launch ascent]]\n[[File:STS-131 afterglow.jpg|thumb|Multicolored [[afterglow]] of the [[STS-131]] launch]]\n\nThe Shuttle was monitored throughout its ascent for short range tracking (10 seconds before liftoff through 57 seconds after), medium range (7 seconds before liftoff through 110 seconds after) and long range (7 seconds before liftoff through 165 seconds after). Short range cameras included 22 16mm cameras on the Mobile Launch Platform and 8 16mm on the Fixed Service Structure, 4 high speed fixed cameras located on the perimeter of the launch complex plus an additional 42 fixed cameras with 16mm motion picture film. Medium range cameras included remotely operated tracking cameras at the launch complex plus 6 sites along the immediate coast north and south of the launch pad, each with 800mm lens and high speed cameras running 100 frames per second. These cameras ran for only 4\u201310 seconds due to limitations in the amount of film available. Long range cameras included those mounted on the external tank, SRBs and orbiter itself which streamed live video back to the ground providing valuable information about any debris falling during ascent. Long range tracking cameras with 400-inch film and 200-inch video lenses were operated by a photographer at [[Playalinda Beach]] as well as 9 other sites from 38 miles north at the [[Ponce Inlet]] to 23 miles south to [[Patrick Air Force Base]] (PAFB) and additional mobile optical tracking camera was stationed on Merritt Island during launches. A total of 10 HD cameras were used both for ascent information for engineers and broadcast feeds to networks such as [[NASA TV]] and [[HDNet]]. The number of cameras significantly increased and numerous existing cameras were upgraded at the recommendation of the [[Columbia Accident Investigation Board]] to provide better information about the debris during launch. Debris was also tracked using a pair of [[Weibel Scientific|Weibel]] Continuous Pulse Doppler X-band radars, one on board the SRB recovery ship [[MV Liberty Star|MV ''Liberty Star'']] positioned north east of the launch pad and on a ship positioned south of the launch pad.

By the 1990s and 2000s the focus shifted more to servicing the space station, with fewer satellite launches. Most missions involved staying in orbit several days to two weeks, although longer missions were possible with the [[Extended Duration Orbiter]] add-on or when attached to a space station.\n\n{|\n|[[File:STS-132 Atlantis at ISS 1.jpg|thumb|right|''Atlantis'' docked at ''Harmony'' module of the International Space Station]]\n|[[File:Capturing the Solar Maximum Mission satellite.jpg|thumb|right|Astronaut with satellite to repair]]\n|[[File:Endeavour docked to ISS.jpg|thumb|''Endeavour'' docked at ISS]]\n|}\n\n===Re-entry and landing===\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2007}}\n\nAlmost the entire Space Shuttle re-entry procedure, except for lowering the landing gear and deploying the air data probes, was normally performed under computer control. However, the re-entry could be flown entirely manually if an emergency arose. The approach and landing phase could be controlled by the autopilot, but was usually hand flown.\n\n[[File:Space Shuttle Atlantis in the sky on July 21, 2011, to its final landing.jpg|thumb|right|Glowing plasma trail from Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'' re-entry as seen from the Space Station]]\n\nThe vehicle began re-entry by firing the Orbital maneuvering system engines, while flying upside down, backside first, in the opposite direction to orbital motion for approximately three minutes, which reduced the Shuttle's velocity by about  {{convert|200|mph|km/h|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}. The resultant slowing of the Shuttle lowered its orbital [[perigee]] down into the upper atmosphere. The Shuttle then flipped over, by pushing its nose down (which was actually \"up\" relative to the Earth, because it was flying upside down). This OMS firing was done roughly halfway around the globe from the landing site.\n\nThe vehicle started encountering more significant air density in the lower thermosphere at about {{convert|400000|ft|km|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, at around [[Mach number|Mach]] 25, {{convert|8200|m/s|km/h mph|abbr=on|sigfig=2|sp=us}}. The vehicle was controlled by a combination of [[Reaction Control System|RCS thrusters]] and control surfaces, to fly at a 40-degree nose-up attitude, producing high drag, not only to slow it down to landing speed, but also to reduce reentry heating. As the vehicle encountered progressively denser air, it began a gradual transition from spacecraft to aircraft. In a straight line, its 40-degree nose-up attitude would cause the descent angle to flatten-out, or even rise. The vehicle therefore performed a series of four steep S-shaped banking turns, each lasting several minutes, at up to 70 degrees of bank, while still maintaining the 40-degree angle of attack. In this way it dissipated speed sideways rather than upwards. This occurred during the 'hottest' phase of re-entry, when the heat-shield glowed red and the G-forces were at their highest. By the end of the last turn, the transition to aircraft was almost complete.

If hydrogen was detected, an emergency would be declared, the orbiter powered down and teams would evacuate the area. A convoy of 25 specially designed vehicles and 150 trained engineers and technicians approached the orbiter.

Harry Stine]]'s 1981 novel ''[[Shuttle Down]]''. In the 1986 film ''[[SpaceCamp]]'', ''Atlantis'' accidentally launched into space with a group of [[U.S. Space Camp]] participants as its crew. The 1998 film ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' portrayed a combined crew of offshore oil rig workers and US military staff who pilot two modified Shuttles to avert the destruction of Earth by an asteroid. Retired American test pilots visited a Russian satellite in the 2000 [[Clint Eastwood]] adventure film ''[[Space Cowboys]]''. In the 2003 film ''The Core,'' the ''Endeavour'''s landing is disrupted by the earth's magnetic core, and its crew is selected to pilot the vehicle designed to restart the core. The 2004 Bollywood movie ''[[Swades]]'', where a Space Shuttle was used to launch a special rainfall monitoring satellite, was filmed at Kennedy Space Center in the year following the [[Columbia disaster]] that had taken the life of Indian-American astronaut [[Kalpana Chawla|KC Chawla]]. On television, the 1996 drama ''[[The Cape (1996 TV series)|The Cape]]'' portrayed the lives of a group of NASA astronauts as they prepared for and flew Shuttle missions. ''[[Odyssey 5]]'' was a short lived sci-fi series that featured the crew of a Space Shuttle as the last survivors of a disaster that destroyed Earth.  The 1997- 2007 Sci-fi series Stargate SG-1 had a shuttle rescue written into an episode.  The 2013 film ''[[Gravity (film)|Gravity]]'' features the fictional space shuttle ''Explorer'', whose crew are killed or left stranded after it is destroyed by a shower of high speed orbital debris.\n<!--Please don't list every single TV show/movie the shuttle is mentioned on or appears in.
