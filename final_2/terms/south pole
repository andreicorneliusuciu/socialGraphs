It is the southernmost point on the surface of the [[Earth]] and lies on the opposite side of the Earth from the [[North Pole]].\n\nSituated on the continent of [[Antarctica]], it is the site of the [[United States]] [[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]], which was established in 1956 and has been permanently staffed since that year. The Geographic South Pole should not be confused with the [[South Magnetic Pole]], which is defined based on the Earth's magnetic field. The South Pole is at the center of the [[Southern Hemisphere]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Geographic Southpole crop.jpg|thumb|The Geographic South Pole. (The flag used on the flagpole is interchangeable.)]]\n[[Image:Ceremonial South Pole.jpg|thumb|The Ceremonial South Pole in 1998. (Background structures shown have since been replaced or altered.)]]\n[[Image:Amundsen-scott-south pole station 2007.jpg|thumb|The Ceremonial South Pole as of February 2008.]]\nFor most purposes, the Geographic South Pole is defined as the southern point of the two points where the Earth's [[axis of rotation]] intersects its surface (the other being the [[North Pole|Geographic North Pole]]). However, the Earth's axis of rotation is actually subject to very small \"wobbles\" ([[polar motion]]), so this definition is not adequate for very precise work.\n\nThe [[geographic coordinate]]s of the South Pole are usually given simply as 90\u00b0S, since its longitude is geometrically undefined and irrelevant. When a longitude is desired, it may be given as {{nowrap|0\u00b0.}} At the South Pole, all directions face north. For this reason, directions at the Pole are given relative to \"grid north\", which points northwards along the [[prime meridian]].<ref>[http://quest.nasa.gov/antarctica/background/cara/movpole.html \"Moving the South Pole\"], NASA Quest</ref> Along tight latitude circles, clockwise is east, and counterclockwise is west, opposite to the [[North Pole]].\n\nThe Geographic South Pole is located on the continent of [[Antarctica]] (although this has not been the case for all of [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] because of [[continental drift]]). It sits atop a featureless, barren, windswept and icy plateau at an altitude of 2,835 metres (9,301&nbsp;ft) above sea level, and is located about 1,300&nbsp;km (800&nbsp;mi) from the nearest open sea at [[Bay of Whales]]. The ice is estimated to be about 2,700 metres (9,000&nbsp;ft) thick at the Pole, so the land surface under the [[ice sheet]] is actually near sea level.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/support/southp.jsp Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station], National Science Foundation, Office of Polar Programs</ref>\n\nThe polar ice sheet is moving at a rate of roughly 10 metres per year in a direction between 37\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 west of grid north,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.southpolestation.com/pole/survey.html | title=Where is the real Pole really? | accessdate=2008-03-25 }}</ref> down towards the [[Weddell Sea]]. Therefore, the position of the station and other artificial features relative to the geographic pole gradually shift over time.\n\nThe Geographic South Pole is marked by a stake in the ice alongside a small sign; these are repositioned each year in a ceremony on [[New Year's Day]] to compensate for the movement of the ice.<ref name=antarcticsun2006>[http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/pastIssues/2005-2006/2006_01_08.pdf \"Marker makes annual move\"], page 6, Antarctic Sun.

Amundsen named his camp [[Polheim]] and the entire plateau surrounding the Pole ''[[King Haakon VII Vidde]]'' in honour of King [[Haakon VII of Norway]]. Robert Falcon Scott returned to Antarctica with his second expedition, the [[Terra Nova Expedition]], initially unaware of Amundsen's secretive expedition. Scott and four other men reached the South Pole on January 17, 1912, thirty-four days after Amundsen. On the return trip, Scott and his four companions all died of starvation and extreme cold.\n\nIn 1914 Ernest Shackleton's [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] set out with the goal of crossing Antarctica via the South Pole, but his ship, the ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]'', was frozen in [[Sea ice|pack ice]] and sank 11 months later. The overland journey was never made.\n\nUS Admiral [[Richard Evelyn Byrd]], with the assistance of his first pilot [[Bernt Balchen]], became the first person to fly over the South Pole on November 29, 1928.\n\n===1950\u2013present===\n[[Image:SPSM.05.jpg|thumb|[[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]].\n\nThe ceremonial pole and flags can be seen in the background, slightly to the left of centre, below the tracks behind the buildings.

In the summer (September\u2013March), the sun is continuously above the horizon and appears to move in a counter-clockwise circle. However, it is always low in the sky, reaching a maximum of 23.5\u00b0 in December. Much of the sunlight that does reach the surface is reflected by the white snow. This lack of warmth from the sun, combined with the high altitude (about {{convert|2800|m|ft|sigfig=2}}), means that the South Pole has one of the coldest climates on Earth (though it is not quite the coldest; that record goes to the region in the vicinity of the [[Vostok Station]], also in Antarctica, which lies at a higher elevation).<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090610045758/http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/scienceques2001/20020118.htm Science question of the week], Goddard Space Flight Center.</ref> Temperatures at the South Pole are much lower than at the North Pole, primarily because the South Pole is located at altitude in the middle of a continental land mass, while the North Pole is at sea level in the middle of an ocean, which acts as a reservoir of heat.\n\nIn midsummer, as the sun reaches its maximum elevation of about 23.5 degrees, high temperatures at the South Pole in January average at {{convert|-25.9|C|F|0|abbr=on}}.

This line of reasoning fails at the South Pole, where the sun rises and sets only once per year, and all lines of longitude, and hence all time zones, converge. There is no ''a priori'' reason for placing the South Pole in any particular time zone, but as a matter of practical convenience the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station keeps [[New Zealand Time]]. This is because the US flies its resupply missions (\"[[Operation Deep Freeze]]\") out of [[McMurdo Station]], which is supplied from [[Christchurch]], New Zealand.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nDue to its exceptionally harsh climate, there are no native resident plants or animals at the South Pole.
