This is the orbital period in an inertial (non-rotating) [[frame of reference]].\n* The '''synodic period''' is the amount of time that it takes the for an object to reappear at the same point in relation to two or more other objects (e.g. the [[Moon]]'s phase and its position relative to the [[Sun]] and [[Earth]] repeats every 29.5 day synodic period, longer than its 27.3 day orbit around the Earth, due to the motion of the Earth about the Sun). The time between two successive [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunctions]] is also an example of the synodic period. For the planets in the solar system, the synodic period (with respect to Earth) differs from the sidereal period due to the Earth's orbiting around the Sun.\n* The '''draconitic period''', or '''draconic period''', is the time that elapses between two passages of the object through its [[orbital node|ascending node]], the point of its orbit where it crosses the [[ecliptic]] from the southern to the northern hemisphere. This period differs from the sidereal period because both the orbital plane of the object and the plane of the ecliptic precess with respect to the fixed stars, so their intersection, the [[line of nodes]], also precesses with respect to the fixed stars. Although the plane of the ecliptic is often held fixed at the position it occupied at a specific [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]], the orbital plane of the object still precesses causing the draconitic period to differ from the sidereal period.\n* The '''anomalistic period''' is the time that elapses between two passages of an object at its [[periapsis]] (in the case of the planets in the [[solar system]], called the [[perihelion]]), the point of its closest approach to the attracting body. It differs from the sidereal period because the object's [[semimajor axis]] typically advances slowly.\n* Also, the Earth's '''tropical period''' (or simply its \"year\") is the time that elapses between two alignments of its axis of rotation with the Sun, also viewed as two passages of the object at [[right ascension]] zero. One Earth year has a slightly shorter interval than the solar orbit (sidereal period) because the inclined axis and equatorial plane slowly [[Precession|precess]] (rotate with respect to the stars), realigning with the Sun before the orbit completes. The Earth's precession cycle completes in about 25,770 years.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Small body orbiting a central body==\nAccording to [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's Third Law]], the '''orbital period''' ''T'' (in seconds) of two bodies orbiting each other in a circular or [[elliptic orbit]] is:{{cn|date=March 2016}}\n\n:<math>T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{\\mu}}</math>\n\nwhere:\n* ''r'' is the orbit's [[semi-major axis]] in meters\n* ''\u03bc'' = ''GM'' is the [[standard gravitational parameter]] in m<sup>3</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>\n** ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]],\n** ''M'' is the mass of the more massive body.\n\nFor all ellipses with a given semi-major axis the orbital period is the same, regardless of eccentricity.\n\nInversely, for calculating the distance where a body has to orbit in order to pulse a given orbital period:\n\n:<math>r = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{GMT^2}{4\\pi^2}}</math>\n\nwhere:\n* ''r'' is the orbit's [[semi-major axis]] in meters,\n* ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]],\n* ''M'' is the mass of the more massive body,\n* ''T'' is the orbital period in seconds.\n\nFor instance, for completing an orbit every 24&nbsp;[[hour]]s around a mass of 100&nbsp;[[kg]], a small body has to orbit at a distance of 1.08&nbsp;[[metre|meters]] from its [[center of mass]].\n\n==Orbital period as a function of central body's density==\nWhen a very small body is in a circular orbit barely above the surface of a sphere of any radius and mean density ''\u03c1'' (in kg/m<sup>3</sup>), the above equation simplifies to (since ''M''&nbsp;= ''V\u03c1''&nbsp;= {{sfrac|4|3}}{{pi}}''a''<sup>3</sup>''\u03c1''):{{cn|date=March 2016}}<!-- this derivation needs a source; else is [[WP:OR]] -->\n\n:<math>T = \\sqrt{ \\frac {3\\pi}{G \\rho} }</math>\n\nSo, for the Earth as the central body (or any other spherically symmetric body with the same mean density, about 5,515&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>)<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=density+of+the+earth |title=Density of the Earth |publisher=wolframalpha.com}}</ref> we get:\n:''T'' = 1.41 hours\n\nand for a body made of water (''\u03c1''&nbsp;\u2248&nbsp;1,000&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>)<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=density+of+water |title=Density of water |publisher=wolframalpha.com}}</ref>\n\n:''T'' = 3.30 hours\n\nThus, as an alternative for using a very small number like ''G'', the strength of universal gravity can be described using some reference material, like water: the orbital period for an orbit just above the surface of a spherical body of water is 3 hours and 18 minutes. Conversely, this can be used as a kind of \"universal\" [[time standard|unit of time]] if we have a unit of mass, a unit of length and a unit of density.\n\n==Two bodies orbiting each other==<!-- This section is linked from [[Binary star]] -->\nIn [[celestial mechanics]], when both orbiting bodies' masses have to be taken into account, the '''orbital period''' ''T'' can be calculated as follows:<ref>Bradley W.

Pearson 2007.</ref>\n\n:<math>T= 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{G \\left(M_1 + M_2\\right)}}</math>\n\nwhere:\n* ''r'' is the sum of the [[semi-major axis|semi-major axes]] of the ellipses in which the centers of the bodies move, or equivalently, the semi-major axis of the ellipse in which one body moves, in the frame of reference with the other body at the origin (which is equal to their constant separation for circular orbits),\n* ''M''<sub>1</sub> + ''M''<sub>2</sub> is the sum of the masses of the two bodies,\n* ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]].\n\nNote that the orbital period is independent of size: for a scale model it would be the same, when densities are the same (see also [[Orbit#Scaling in gravity]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nIn a parabolic or hyperbolic trajectory, the motion is not periodic, and the duration of the full trajectory is infinite.\n\n==Synodic period==\nWhen two bodies orbit a third body in different orbits, and thus different orbital periods, their respective, '''synodic period''' can be found. If the orbital periods of the two bodies around the third are called ''P''<sub>1</sub> and ''P''<sub>2</sub>, so that ''P''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;<&nbsp;''P''<sub>2</sub>, their synodic period is given by:{{cn|date=August 2016}}\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{P_\\mathrm{syn}}=\\frac{1}{P_1}-\\frac{1}{P_2}</math>\n\n==Examples of sidereal and synodic periods==\nTable of synodic periods in the Solar System, relative to Earth:{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

The Earth's motion does not determine this value for other planets because an Earth observer is not orbited by the moons in question. For example, [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]'s synodic period is 1.2648&nbsp;days, 0.18% longer than Deimos's sidereal period of 1.2624&nbsp;d.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}<!--- The Earth-synodic period can also be calculated, but it varies with the planet's position with respect to the Earth; in the Deimos example, at Mars opposition the Earth-synodic period would be about 1.2604&nbsp;d because Earth's motion overtakes Mars. At Mars conjunction, Deimos's Earth-synodic period would be 1.2692 d because Earth's motion now accentuates Mars's apparent motion. Since the Earth--extra-planetary moon synodic period reflects Earth-planet-moon alignments, it is fairly meaningless. --->\n\n==Binary stars==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n![[Binary star]]!!Orbital period\n|-\n| [[AM Canum Venaticorum]]\n| style=\"text-align: right\" | 17.146 minutes\n|-\n| [[Beta Lyrae]] AB\n| style=\"text-align: right\" | 12.9075 days\n|-\n| [[Alpha Centauri]] AB\n| style=\"text-align: right\" | 79.91 years\n|-\n| [[Proxima Centauri]] \u2013 [[Alpha Centauri]] AB\n|  style=\"text-align: right\" | 500,000 years or more\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Geosynchronous orbit derivation]]\n* [[Rotation period]] \u2013 time that it takes to complete one revolution around its axis of rotation\n* [[Sidereal time]]\n* [[Sidereal year]]\n* [[Opposition (astronomy)]]\n* [[List of periodic comets]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|synodic}}\n\n{{Orbits}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Orbital Period}}\n[[Category:Time in astronomy]]\n[[Category:Orbits|Period]]"}]}}}}
