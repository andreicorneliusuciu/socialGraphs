The applications were originally for dealing with [[Ionizing radiation|radioactive]] or [[biohazard]]ous materials, using [[robotic arm]]s, or they were used in inaccessible places. In more recent developments they have been used in diverse range of applications including [[welding]] automation,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ljwelding.com/products/type/welding-manipulators/|title=Welding Manipulators {{!}} Subarc Welding & CMT Manipulators|last=Automation|first=LJ Welding|website=www.ljwelding.com|access-date=2016-09-26}}</ref> [[Robotic surgery|robotically-assisted surgery]] and in [[Robotic arm|space]]. It is an arm-like mechanism that consists of a series of segments, usually sliding or jointed called cross-slides,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ljwelding.com/https/www.ljwelding.com/products/type/accessories/cross-slides|title=Cross Slides|last=Automation|first=LJ Welding|website=www.ljwelding.com|access-date=2016-09-26}}</ref> which grasp and move objects with a number of [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]].\n\nIn industrial ergonomics a manipulator is a lift assist device used to help workers lift, maneuver and place articles in process that are too heavy, too hot, too large or otherwise too difficult for a single worker to manually handle. As opposed to simply vertical lift assists (cranes, hoists, etc.) manipulators have the ability to reach in to tight spaces and remove workpieces. A good example would be removing large stamped parts from a press and placing them in a rack or similar dunnage. In welding, a column boom manipulator is used to increase deposition rates, reduce human error and other costs in a manufacturing setting.\n\nAdditionally, manipulator tooling gives the lift assist the ability to pitch, roll, or spin the part for appropriate placement. An example would be removing a part from a press in the horizontal and then pitching it up for vertical placement in a rack or rolling a part over for exposing the back of the part.\n\n==Specialized types==\nOne of the types of manipulators is balanced manipulator type MSP-250, controlled by the operator's hand. Such manipulators are used in various industries. Where there are special requirements to protect against [[Fire protection|fire]] and [[Explosion protection|explosion]], they may be driven by [[compressed air]].\n\nA welding manipulator can be either [[Gas metal arc welding|open arc]] or [[Submerged arc welding|submerged arc]]. A welding manipulator can be used to weld horizontally and vertically and is ideal for [[job shop]]s as they are robust, have high production volume capacity and a greater degree of flexibility in product engineering. Welding manipulators are commonly used in [[Pipeline transport|pipe]] and [[Tank container|vessel]] fabrication<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefabricator.com/article/arcwelding/thinking-about-submerged-arc-welding-|title=Thinking about submerged arc welding? - The Fabricator|website=www.thefabricator.com|access-date=2016-09-26}}</ref> but can be used in a [[Cladding (metalworking)|cladding]] procedure with the aid of a proper welding [[Fixture (tool)|fixture]].\n\n==Examples==\nExamples of robotic manipulators are:\n* [[Canadarm]]\n* [[Terabot-S]] by Oceaneering Space Systems\n* [[SCARA]]\n* [[da Vinci Surgical System]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Robotics}}\n* [[ANAT Technology]] (Articulated Nimble Adaptable Trunk) \n* [[Industrial robots]]\n* [[Robotic arm]]\n* [[Telemanipulator]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Robotics}}\n\n[[Category:Robotic manipulation]]\n[[Category:Robotic manipulators| ]]\n\n\n{{Robo-stub}}"}]}}}}
