A cascading Kessler syndrome becomes more likely as satellites in orbit increase in number.

Collisions that occur in this altitude range are also less of an issue because the directions into which the fragments fly and/or their lower [[specific energy]] often result in orbits intersecting with Earth or having [[apsis|perigee]] below this altitude.\n\n[[Orbital decay]] is much slower at altitudes where atmospheric drag is insignificant. Slight [[atmospheric drag]], lunar [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]], and [[solar wind]] drag can gradually bring debris down to lower altitudes where fragments finally reenter, but this process can take millennia at very high altitudes.\n\n==Implications==\n[[File:Space Debris Low Earth Orbit.png|thumb|Image made from models used to track debris in Earth orbit.]]\nThe Kessler syndrome is especially insidious because of the \"[[cascading failure|domino effect]]\" and \"[[feedback runaway]]\" wherein impacts between objects of sizable mass [[spall]]s off debris from the force of collision. The shrapnel can then hit other objects, producing even more space debris: if a large enough collision or explosion were to occur, such as between a space station and a defunct satellite, or as the result of hostile actions in space, then the resulting debris cascade could make prospects for longterm viability of satellites in low earth orbit extremely low.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://physics.ucsc.edu/cosmo/Mountbat.PDF\n| title = Debris and Future Space Activities\n| accessdate =\n| author =\n| last = Primack\n| first = Joel R.\n| authorlink =\n| year = 2002\n| format = PDF\n| work =\n| publisher = Physics Department, University of California,\n| location =\n| pages =\n| language =\n| doi =\n| archiveurl =\n| archivedate =\n| dateformat =\n| quote = With enough orbiting debris, pieces will begin to hit other pieces, setting off a chain reaction of destruction that will leave a lethal halo around the Earth.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://physics.ucsc.edu/cosmo/UNESCOr.pdf\n| title = Star Wars Forever? \u2013 A Cosmic Perspective\n| accessdate =\n| author = Joel R.

The catastrophic scenarios predict an increase in the number of collisions per year, as opposed to a physically impassable barrier to space exploration which occurs in higher orbits.\n\n==Avoidance and reduction==\nDesigners of a new vehicle or satellite are frequently required to demonstrate that it can be safely disposed of at the end of its life, for example by use of a controlled [[atmospheric reentry]] system or a boost into a [[graveyard orbit]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.space.com/spacenews/businessmonday_040628.html  | title=FCC Enters Orbital Debris Debate |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080506022635/http://www.space.com/spacenews/businessmonday_040628.html |archivedate = 2008-05-06}}</ref> \nIn order to obtain a license to provide telecommunications services in the United States, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) requires all geostationary satellites launched after March 18, 2002, to commit to moving to a graveyard orbit at the end of their operational life.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.space.com/spacenews/businessmonday_040628.html | title=FCC Enters Orbital Debris Debate}}</ref> U.S. government regulations require a boost, <math>\\Delta{H}</math>, of ~300&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/USG_OD_Standard_Practices.pdf | title=US Government Orbital Debris Standard Practices}}</ref>\n\nOne technology proposed to help deal with fragments from 1&nbsp;cm to 10&nbsp;cm in size is the [[laser broom]], a proposed multimegawatt land-based laser that could deorbit debris: the side of the debris hit by the laser would [[ablation|ablate]] and create a thrust that would change the [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of the remains of the fragment until it would re-enter harmlessly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/debris-00a.html |title=NASA Hopes Laser Broom Will Help Clean Up Space Debris |publisher=SpaceDaily |accessdate=2011-03-17}}</ref>\n\n==Potential trigger==\nThe [[Envisat]] satellite is a large, inactive satellite with a mass of {{convert|8211|kg|lb|abbr=on}} that drifts at {{convert|785|km|mi|abbr=on}}, an altitude where the debris environment is the greatest\u20142 catalogued objects can be expected to pass within about 200 meters of Envisat every year<ref name=Kessler/>\u2014and likely to increase.
