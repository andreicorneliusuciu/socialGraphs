Where ''Z''<sub>S</sub> represents the [[characteristic impedance]] of a [[transmission line]], minimum reflection is obtained when\n\n: <math  alt=\"the source impedance equals the load impedance\">Z_\\mathrm S = Z_\\mathrm L \\, </math>\n\nThe concept of impedance matching found first applications in [[electrical engineering]], but is relevant in other applications in which a form of energy, not necessarily electrical, is transferred between a source and a load. An alternative to impedance matching is [[impedance bridging]], in which the load impedance is chosen to be much larger than the source impedance and maximizing voltage transfer, rather than power, is the goal.\n\n{{toc limit}}\n\n== {{anchor|Explanation}}Theory ==\nImpedance is the opposition by a system to the flow of energy from a source. For constant signals, this impedance can also be constant. For varying signals, it usually changes with frequency. The energy involved can be [[electrical impedance|electrical]], [[mechanical impedance|mechanical]], [[acoustic impedance|acoustic]], [[magnetic impedance|magnetic]], or [[thermal impedance|thermal]]. The concept of electrical impedance is perhaps the most commonly known. Electrical impedance, like electrical resistance, is measured in [[Ohm (unit)|ohms]]. In general, impedance has a [[complex number|complex]] value; this means that loads generally have a [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] component (symbol: ''R'') which forms the [[real number|real]] part of ''Z'' and a [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] component (symbol: ''X'') which forms the [[imaginary number|imaginary]] part of ''Z''.\n\nIn simple cases (such as low-frequency or direct-current power transmission) the reactance may be negligible or zero; the impedance can be considered a pure resistance, expressed as a real number. In the following summary we will consider the general case when resistance and reactance are both significant, and the special case in which the reactance is negligible.\n\n===Reflection-less matching===\nImpedance matching to minimize reflections is achieved by making the load impedance equal to the source impedance. If the source impedance, load impedance and transmission line [[characteristic impedance]] are purely resistive, then reflection-less matching is the same as maximum power transfer matching.<ref>{{harvnb|Stutzman|Thiele|2012|p=177}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xhZRA1K57wIC&pg=RA1-PA177#v=onepage&q&f=true page link]</ref>\n\n===Maximum power transfer matching===\nComplex conjugate matching is used when maximum power transfer is required, namely\n\n:  <math alt=\"the load impedance equals the complex conjugate of the source impedance\">Z_\\mathsf{load} = Z_\\mathsf{source}^* \\, </math>\n\nwhere * indicates the [[complex conjugate]]. This differs from reflection-less matching only when the source or load have a reactive component.\n\nIf the source has a reactive component, but the [[electrical load|load]] is purely resistive, then matching can be achieved by adding a reactance of the same magnitude but opposite sign to the load.  This simple matching network, consisting of a single [[electrical element|element]], will usually only achieve a perfect match at a single frequency.  This is because the added element will either be a capacitor or an inductor, whose impedance in both cases is frequency dependent, and will not, in general, follow the frequency dependence of the source impedance. For wide [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] applications, a more complex network must be designed.\n\n== Power transfer ==\n{{Main|Maximum power theorem}}\nWhenever a source of power ''with a fixed output impedance'' such as an [[electric]] [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] source, a [[radio]] [[transmitter]] or a mechanical sound (e.g., a [[loudspeaker]]) operates into a [[External electric load|load]], the maximum possible [[Power (physics)|power]] is delivered to the load when the impedance of the load ([[load impedance]] or [[input impedance]]) is equal to the ''[[complex conjugate]]'' of the impedance of the source (that is, its [[internal impedance]] or [[output impedance]]).  For two impedances to be complex conjugates their resistances must be equal, and their reactances must be equal in magnitude but of opposite signs. In low-frequency or DC systems (or systems with purely resistive sources and loads) the reactances are zero, or small enough to be ignored.  In this case, maximum power transfer occurs when the resistance of the load is equal to the resistance of the source (see [[maximum power theorem]] for a mathematical proof).\n\nImpedance matching is not always necessary. For example, if a source with a low impedance is connected to a load with a high impedance the power that can pass through the connection is limited by the higher impedance.  This maximum-voltage connection is a common configuration called ''[[impedance bridging]]'' or ''voltage bridging'', and is widely used in signal processing. In such applications, delivering a high voltage (to minimize signal degradation during transmission or to consume less power by reducing currents) is often more important than maximum power transfer.\n\nIn older audio systems (reliant on transformers and passive filter networks, and based on the [[telephone]] system), the source and load resistances were matched at 600 ohms. One reason for this was to maximize power transfer, as there were no amplifiers available that could restore lost signal. Another reason was to ensure correct operation of the [[hybrid coil|hybrid transformers]] used at central exchange equipment to separate outgoing from incoming speech, so these could be amplified or fed to a [[four-wire circuit]]. Most modern audio circuits, on the other hand, use active amplification and filtering and can use voltage-bridging connections for greatest accuracy. Strictly speaking, impedance matching only applies when both source and load devices are [[linearity|linear]]; however, matching may be obtained between nonlinear devices within certain operating ranges.\n\n=={{anchor|Impedance matching devices}}Impedance-matching devices==\nAdjusting the source impedance or the load impedance, in general, is called \"impedance matching\". There are three ways to improve an impedance mismatch, all of which are called \"impedance matching\":\n* Devices intended to present an apparent load to the source of ''Z''<sub>load</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''Z''<sub>source</sub>* (complex conjugate matching). Given a source with a fixed voltage and fixed source impedance, the [[maximum power theorem]] says this is the only way to extract the maximum power from the source.\n* Devices intended to present an apparent load of ''Z''<sub>load</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''Z''<sub>line</sub> (complex impedance matching), to avoid echoes. Given a transmission line source with a fixed source impedance, this \"reflectionless impedance matching\" at the end of the transmission line is the only way to avoid reflecting echoes back to the transmission line.\n* Devices intended to present an apparent source resistance as close to zero as possible, or presenting an apparent source voltage as high as possible. This is the only way to maximize energy efficiency, and so it is used at the beginning of electrical power lines. Such an [[impedance bridging]] connection also minimizes [[distortion]] and [[electromagnetic interference]]; it is also used in modern audio amplifiers and signal-processing devices.\n\nThere are a variety of devices used between a source of energy and a load that perform \"impedance matching\". To match electrical impedances, engineers use combinations of [[transformer]]s, [[resistor]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[capacitor]]s and [[transmission lines]]. These passive (and active) impedance-matching devices are optimized for different applications and include [[balun]]s, [[antenna tuner]]s (sometimes called ATUs or roller-coasters, because of their appearance), acoustic horns, matching networks, and [[Electrical termination|terminators]].\n\n===Transformers===\n[[Transformer]]s are sometimes used to match the impedances of circuits. A transformer converts [[alternating current]] at one [[voltage]] to the same waveform at another voltage. The power input to the transformer and output from the transformer is the same (except for conversion losses). The side with the lower voltage is at low impedance (because this has the lower number of turns), and the side with the higher voltage is at a higher impedance (as it has more turns in its coil).\n\nOne example of this method involves a television [[balun]] transformer. This transformer converts a balanced signal from the antenna (via 300-ohm [[twin-lead]]) into an unbalanced signal (75-ohm coaxial cable such as [[RG-6]]). To match the impedances of both devices, both cables must be connected to a matching transformer with a turns ratio of 2 (such as a 2:1 transformer). In this example, the 75-ohm cable is connected to the transformer side with fewer turns; the 300-ohm line is connected to the transformer side with more turns. The formula for calculating the transformer turns ratio for this example is:\n: <math>\\text{turns ratio} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{source resistance}}{\\text{load resistance}}}</math>\n\n===Resistive network===\nResistive impedance matches are easiest to design and can be achieved with a simple [[L pad#Impedance matching|L pad]] consisting of two resistors. Power loss is an unavoidable consequence of using resistive networks, and they are only (usually) used to transfer [[line level]] signals.\n\n===Stepped transmission line===\nMost [[Lumped element model|lumped-element]] devices can match a specific range of load impedances.  For example, in order to match an inductive load into a real impedance, a capacitor needs to be used. If the load impedance becomes capacitive, the matching element must be replaced by an inductor.  In many cases, there is a need to use the same circuit to match a broad range of load impedance and thus simplify the circuit design.  This issue was addressed by the stepped transmission line,<ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WJX-4W2122T-1&_user=5755111&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000000150&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=5755111&md5=fe79f204b33cf7eb6d03cb89ff250c91 Chunqui Qian and William W. Brey, \"Impedance matching with an adjustable segmented transmission line\". ''Journal of Magnetic Resonance'', vol. 199 issue 1 (July 2009), pp. 104-110] Retrieved 2011-10-29.</ref> where multiple, serially placed, quarter-wave dielectric slugs are used to vary a transmission line's characteristic impedance.  By controlling the position of each element, a broad range of load impedances can be matched without having to reconnect the circuit.\n\n===Filters===\n[[Electronic filter|Filters]] are frequently used to achieve impedance matching in telecommunications and radio engineering.  In general, it is not theoretically possible to achieve perfect impedance matching at all [[frequency|frequencies]] with a network of discrete components.  Impedance matching networks are designed with a definite bandwidth, take the form of a filter, and use filter theory in their design.\n\nApplications requiring only a narrow bandwidth, such as radio tuners and transmitters, might use a simple tuned [[Electronic filter|filter]] such as a [[Stub (electronics)|stub]].  This would provide a perfect match at one specific frequency only.  Wide bandwidth matching requires filters with multiple sections.\n\n====L-section====\n[[File:Matching L Pad.png|thumb|Basic schematic for matching R<sub>1</sub> to R<sub>2</sub> with an L pad.

One of X<sub>1</sub> or X<sub>2</sub> must be an inductor and the other must be a capacitor.  One reactance is in parallel with the source (or load), and the other is in series with the load (or source). If a reactance is in parallel ''with the source'', the effective network matches from high to low impedance. \n\nThe analysis is as follows.<ref name=\"Hayward\">{{cite book| last=Hayward|first= Wesi |year= 1994-2004|title=Introduction to Radio Frquency Design |edition= |publisher=ARRL |isbn= 0-87259-492-0 | pp=138}}</ref>  Consider a real source impedance of <math>R_1</math> and real load impedance of <math>R_2</math>. If a reactance <math>X_1</math> is in parallel with the source impedance, the combined impedance can be written as:\n\n:  <math>\\frac{j R_1 X_1}{R_1 + j X_1} </math>\n\nIf the imaginary part of the above impedance is canceled by the series reactance, the real part is\n\n:<math>\nR_2 = \\frac{R_1 X_1^2}{R_1^2 + X_1^2}\n</math>\n\nSolving for <math>X_1</math>\n\n: <math>   \\left\\vert X_1 \\right\\vert       =  \\frac{R_1 }{Q} </math>.  \n\n: <math>\\left\\vert X_2 \\right\\vert = Q R_2 </math>.\n\n:where <math>Q =  \\sqrt{\\frac{R_1 - R_2}{ R_2 }} </math>.\n\nNote, <math>X_1</math>, the reactance in parallel, has a negative reactance because it is typically a capacitor. This gives the L-network the additional feature of harmonic suppression since it is a low pass filter too.\n\n\nThe inverse connection (impedance step-up) is simply the reverse\u2014for example, reactance in series with the source. The magnitude of the impedance ratio is limited by reactance losses such as the [[Q factor|Q]] of the inductor. Multiple L-sections can be wired in cascade to achieve higher impedance ratios or greater bandwidth. [[Transmission line]] matching networks can be modeled as infinitely many L-sections wired in cascade. Optimal matching circuits can be designed for a particular system using [[Smith chart]]s.\n\n==Power factor correction==\n[[Power factor correction]] devices are intended to cancel the reactive and nonlinear characteristics of a load at the end of a power line. This causes the load seen by the power line to be purely resistive. For a given true power required by a load this minimizes the true current supplied through the power lines, and minimizes power wasted in the resistance of those power lines. For example, a [[maximum power point tracker]] is used to extract the maximum power from a solar panel and efficiently transfer it to batteries, the power grid or other loads.\nThe maximum power theorem applies to its \"upstream\" connection to the solar panel, so it emulates a load resistance equal to the solar panel source resistance.  However, the maximum power theorem does not apply to its \"downstream\" connection. That connection is an [[impedance bridging]] connection; it emulates a high-voltage, low-resistance source to maximize efficiency.\n\nOn the [[power grid]] the overall load is usually [[inductance|inductive]].  Consequently, power factor correction is most commonly achieved with banks of [[capacitor]]s.  It is only necessary for correction to be achieved at one single frequency, the frequency of the supply.  Complex networks are only required when a band of frequencies must be matched and this is the reason why simple capacitors are all that is usually required for power factor correction.\n\n== Transmission lines ==\n[[File:Coaxial transmission line wih one source and one load.svg|thumb|500px|Coaxial transmission line with one source and one load|alt=Schematic diagram of coaxial cable]]\nImpedance bridging is unsuitable for RF connections, because it causes power to be reflected back to the source from the boundary between the high and the low impedances. The reflection creates a [[standing wave]] if there is reflection at both ends of the transmission line, which leads to further power waste and may cause frequency-dependent loss. In these systems, impedance matching is desirable.\n\nIn electrical systems involving [[transmission line]]s (such as radio and [[fiber optics]])\u2014where the length of the line is long compared to the wavelength of the signal (the signal changes rapidly compared to the time it takes to travel from source to load)\u2014 the impedances at each end of the line must be matched to the transmission line's [[characteristic impedance]] (<math>Z_c</math>) to prevent reflections of the signal at the ends of the line. (When the length of the line is short compared to the wavelength, impedance mismatch is the basis of transmission-line impedance transformers; see previous section.)  In radio-frequency (RF) systems, a common value for source and load impedances is 50 [[Ohm (unit)|ohms]]. A typical RF load is a quarter-wave ground plane [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] (37 ohms with an ideal ground plane; it can be matched to 50 ohms by using a modified ground plane or a coaxial matching section, i.e., part or all the feeder of higher impedance).\n\nThe general form of the voltage [[reflection coefficient]] for a wave moving from medium 1 to medium 2 is given by\n\n:<math>\n\\Gamma_{12} = {Z_2 - Z_1 \\over Z_2 + Z_1}\n</math>\n\nwhile the voltage reflection coefficient for a wave moving from medium 2 to medium 1 is\n\n:<math>\n\\Gamma_{21} = {Z_1 - Z_2 \\over Z_1 + Z_2}\n</math>\n\n:<math>\n\\Gamma_{21} = -\\Gamma_{12} \\, </math>\n\nso the reflection coefficient is the same (except for sign), no matter from which direction the wave approaches the boundary.\n\nThere is also a current reflection coefficient; it is the same as the voltage coefficient, except that it has an opposite sign. If the wave encounters an open at the load end, positive voltage and negative current pulses are transmitted back toward the source (negative current means the current is going the opposite direction). Thus, at each boundary there are four reflection coefficients (voltage and current on one side, and voltage and current on the other side).  All four are the same, except that two are positive and two are negative. The voltage reflection coefficient and current reflection coefficient on the same side have opposite signs.  Voltage reflection coefficients on opposite sides of the boundary have opposite signs.\n\nBecause they are all the same except for sign it is traditional to interpret the reflection coefficient as the voltage reflection coefficient (unless otherwise indicated).  Either end (or both ends) of a transmission line can be a source or a load (or both), so there is no inherent preference for which side of the boundary is medium 1 and which side is medium 2. With a single transmission line it is customary to define the voltage reflection coefficient for a wave incident on the boundary from the transmission line side, regardless of whether a source or load is connected on the other side.\n\n==={{anchor|Transmission line with single source driving a load}}Single-source transmission line driving a load===\n\n===={{anchor|Conditions at the load end}}Load-end conditions====\n\nIn a transmission line, a wave travels from the source along the line. Suppose the wave hits a boundary (an abrupt change in impedance).  Some of the wave is reflected back, while some keeps moving onwards.  (Assume there is only one boundary, at the load.)\n\nLet\n:<math> V_i  \\, </math> and <math>I_i \\, </math>  be the voltage and current that is incident on the boundary from the source side.\n:<math> V_t  \\, </math> and <math>I_t \\, </math>  be the voltage and current that is transmitted to the load.\n:<math> V_r  \\, </math> and <math>I_r \\, </math>  be the voltage and current that is reflected back toward the source.\n\nOn the line side of the boundary <math> V_i = Z_c I_i \\, </math> and <math> V_r = -Z_c I_r \\, </math>  and on the load side <math> V_t = Z_L I_t \\, </math> where <math> V_i \\, </math>, <math> V_r \\, </math>, <math> V_t \\, </math>,  <math> I_i \\, </math>, <math> I_r \\, </math>, <math> I_t \\, </math>, and <math> Z_c \\, </math> are [[phasor]]s.\n\nAt a boundary, voltage and current must be continuous, therefore\n:<math> V_t =  V_i + V_r \\, </math>\n:<math> I_t =  I_i + I_r \\, </math>\n\nAll these conditions are satisfied by\n\n:<math> V_r =   \\Gamma_{TL} V_i \\, </math>\n:<math> I_r = - \\Gamma_{TL}  I_i \\, </math>\n:<math> V_t =  (1  + \\Gamma_{TL} ) V_i \\, </math>\n:<math> I_t =  ( 1 - \\Gamma_{TL} ) I_i \\, </math>\n\nwhere <math> \\Gamma_{TL}  \\, </math> the [[reflection coefficient]] going from the transmission line to the load.\n\n:<math>\n\\Gamma_{TL} = {Z_L - Z_c \\over Z_L + Z_c} = \\Gamma_L \\,\n</math><ref>{{Harvtxt|Kraus|1984|p=407}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Sadiku|1989|pp=505\u2013507}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Hayt|1989|pp=398\u2013401}}</ref>\n\nThe purpose of a transmission line is to get the maximum amount of energy to the other end of the line (or to transmit information with minimal error), so the reflection is as small as possible. This is achieved by matching the impedances <math>Z_L</math> and <math>Z_c</math> so that they are equal (<math>\\Gamma = 0</math>).\n\n===={{anchor|Conditions at the source end}}Source-end conditions====\nAt the source end of the transmission line, there may be waves incident both from the source and from the line; a reflection coefficient for each direction may be computed with \n:<math> - \\Gamma_{ST} =  \\Gamma_{TS}  = {Z_s - Z_c \\over Z_s + Z_c} =  \\Gamma_S   \\, </math>,\nwhere ''Zs'' is the source impedance.  The source of waves incident from the line are the reflections from the load end.  If the source impedance matches the line, reflections from the load end will be absorbed at the source end.  If the transmission line is not matched at both ends reflections from the load will be re-reflected at the source and re-re-reflected at the load end ''ad infinitum'', losing energy on each transit of the transmission line.  This can cause a resonance condition and strongly frequency-dependent behavior.  In a narrow-band system this can be desirable for matching, but is generally undesirable in a wide-band system.\n\n====={{anchor|Impedance at the source end}}Source-end impedance=====\n\n:<math> Z_{in} = Z_C  \\frac { (1   + T^2 \\Gamma_L  ) }  {( 1 - T^2 \\Gamma_L  )}        \\,</math> <ref name=\"Karakash52-57\">{{Harvtxt|Karakash|1950|pp=52\u201357}}</ref>\n\nwhere <math>T \\ ,</math> is the one-way transfer function (from either end to the other) when the transmission line is exactly matched at source and load.  <math>T \\, </math> accounts for everything that happens to the signal in transit (including delay, attenuation and dispersion).

This is related to transmission-line theory. Matching also enables the telephone ''[[hybrid coil]]'' (2- to 4-wire conversion) to operate correctly. As the signals are sent and received on the same [[two-wire circuit]] to the central office (or exchange), cancellation is necessary at the telephone earpiece so excessive [[sidetone]] is not heard.  All devices used in telephone signal paths are generally dependent on matched cable, source and load impedances. In the local loop, the impedance chosen is 600 ohms (nominal). Terminating networks are installed at the exchange to offer the best match to their subscriber lines. Each country has its own standard for these networks, but they are all designed to approximate about 600 ohms over the [[voice frequency]] band.\n\n===Loudspeaker amplifiers===\n[[File:Tube push pull poweramplifier.PNG|thumb|Typical push\u2013pull audio tube power amplifier, matched to loudspeaker with an impedance-matching transformer|alt=Schematic diagram of amplifier and speaker, with two tubes and an impedance-matching transformer]]\n\n[[Audio amplifier]]s typically do not match impedances, but provide an output impedance that is lower than the load impedance (such as <&nbsp;0.1 ohm in typical [[semiconductor]] amplifiers), for improved speaker [[damping factor|damping]].  For [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers, impedance-changing transformers are often used to get a low output impedance, and to better match the amplifier's performance to the load impedance.  Some tube amplifiers have output transformer taps to adapt the amplifier output to typical loudspeaker impedances.\n\nThe output [[transformer]] in [[vacuum-tube]]-based amplifiers has two basic functions:\n\n*Separation of the [[alternating current|AC]] component (which contains the audio signals) from the [[direct current|DC]] component (supplied by the [[power supply]]) in the anode circuit of a vacuum-tube-based power stage. A loudspeaker should not be subjected to DC current.\n*Reducing the output impedance of power [[pentode]]s (such as the [[EL34]]) in a [[common-cathode]] configuration.\n\nThe impedance of the loudspeaker on the secondary coil of the transformer will be transformed to a higher impedance on the primary coil in the circuit of the power pentodes by the square of the [[Transformer#Induction law|turns ratio]], which forms the ''impedance scaling factor''.\n\nThe output stage in [[common-drain]] or [[common-collector]] semiconductor-based end stages with [[MOSFET]]s  or [[Transistor|power transistors]] has a very low output impedance. If they are properly balanced, there is no need for a transformer or a large [[electrolytic capacitor]] to separate AC from DC current.\n\n== Non-electrical examples ==\n\n===Acoustics===\nSimilar to electrical transmission lines, an impedance matching problem exists when transferring sound energy from one medium to another. If the [[acoustic impedance]] of the two media are very different most sound energy will be reflected (or absorbed), rather than transferred across the border. The gel used in [[medical ultrasonography]] helps transfer acoustic energy from the transducer to the body and back again. Without the gel, the impedance mismatch in the transducer-to-air and the air-to-body discontinuity reflects almost all the energy, leaving very little to go into the body.\n\nThe bones in the [[middle ear]] provide impedance matching between the eardrum (which is acted upon by vibrations in air) and the fluid-filled inner ear.\n \n[[Horn (acoustic)|Horns]] are used like transformers, matching the impedance of the transducer to the impedance of the air. This principle is used in both [[horn loudspeaker]]s and musical instruments. Most loudspeaker systems contain impedance matching mechanisms, especially for low frequencies. Because most driver impedances which are poorly matched to the impedance of free air at low frequencies (and because of out-of-phase cancellations between output from the front and rear of a speaker cone), loudspeaker enclosures both match impedances and prevent interference. Sound, coupling with air, from a [[loudspeaker]] is related to the ratio of the diameter of the speaker to the wavelength of the sound being reproduced. That is, larger speakers can produce lower frequencies at a higher level than smaller speakers for this reason. [[Elliptical]] speakers are a complex case, acting like large speakers lengthwise and small speakers crosswise. Acoustic impedance matching (or the lack of it) affects the operation of a [[megaphone]], an [[echo (phenomenon)|echo]] and [[soundproofing]].\n\n===Optics===\nA similar effect occurs when [[light]] (or any electromagnetic wave) hits the interface between two media with different [[refractive index|refractive indices]]. For non-magnetic materials, the refractive index is inversely proportional to the material's characteristic impedance.  An ''optical'' or ''wave impedance'' (that depends on the propagation direction) can be calculated for each medium, and may be used in the transmission-line reflection equation\n\n:<math>\nr = {Z_2 - Z_1 \\over Z_1 + Z_2}\n</math>\n\nto calculate reflection and transmission coefficients for the interface.  For non-magnetic dielectrics, this equation is equivalent to the [[Fresnel equations]].  Unwanted reflections can be reduced by the use of an anti-reflection [[optical coating]].\n\n===Mechanics===\nIf a body of mass ''m'' collides elastically with a second body, maximum energy transfer to the second body will occur when the second body has the same mass ''m''. In a head-on collision of equal masses, the energy of the first body will be completely transferred to the second body (as in [[Newton's cradle]] for example). In this case, the masses act as \"mechanical impedances\",{{dubious|reason=mechanical impedances consist of more than just mass and this result probably only holds if the elasticities are equal as well as mass|date=July 2012}} which must be matched. If <math>m_1</math> and <math>m_2</math> are the masses of the moving and stationary bodies, and ''P'' is the momentum of the system (which remains constant throughout the collision), the energy of the second body after the collision will be ''E''<sub>2</sub>:\n\n:<math>\nE_2=\\frac{2P^2m_2}{(m_1+m_2)^2}\n</math>\n\nwhich is analogous to the power-transfer equation.\n\nThese principles are useful in the application of highly energetic materials (explosives). If an explosive charge is placed on a target, the sudden release of energy causes compression waves to propagate through the target radially from the point-charge contact. When the compression waves reach areas of high acoustic impedance mismatch (such as the opposite side of the target), tension waves reflect back and create [[spall]]ing. The greater the mismatch, the greater the effect of creasing and spalling will be. A charge initiated against a wall with air behind it will do more damage to the wall than a charge initiated against a wall with soil behind it.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Power (physics)]]\n*[[Reflection coefficient]]\n*[[Ringing (signal)]]\n*[[Standing wave ratio]]\n*[[Transmission line]]\n*[[Wet Transformer]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{Citation |last=Floyd |first= Thomas |year= 1997 |title= Principles of Electric Circuits |edition= 5th |publisher= Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-232224-2}}\n* {{Citation |last=Hayt |first= William |year= 1989 |title= Engineering Electromagnetics |edition= 5th |publisher= McGraw-Hill |isbn= 0-07-027406-1}}\n* {{Citation |last=Karakash  |first= John J. |year= 1950 |title= Transmission Lines and Filter Networks |edition= 1st |publisher= Macmillan |doi=}}\n* {{Citation |last=Kraus  |first= John D. |year= 1984 |title= Electromagnetics |edition= 3rd |publisher= McGraw-Hill |isbn= 0-07-035423-5 |doi=}}\n* {{Citation |last=Sadiku |first= Matthew N.
