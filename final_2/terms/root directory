It can be likened to the trunk of a [[Tree (data structure)|tree]], as the starting point where all branches originate from.  The '''root file system''' is the file system contained on the same [[disk partition]] on which the root directory is located; it is the filesystem on top of which all other file systems are [[Mount (computing)|mounted]] as the system [[Booting|boots up]].\n\n==Metaphor==\nTo use the example of a physical file cabinet, if the separate drawers in the file cabinet are represented as the highest level of [[Directory (computing)|sub-directories]] in the file system or system prompt, then the room the file cabinet is in may be represented as the root directory. That is, the other directories may be inside it, but the root directory cannot go in any other directories, at least in that file system. In most [[operating system]]s, [[Computer file|files]] can be placed inside the root directory, as well as in its sub-directories. One may envision this as placing paper files anywhere in the room, or into any file cabinet within the room.\n\n==Multiple root directories==\nUnix abstracts the nature of this tree hierarchy entirely and in [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems the root directory is denoted by the <code>/</code> (slash) sign. Though the root directory is conventionally referred to as <code>/</code>, the directory entry itself has no name{{snd}}  its name is the \"empty\" part before the initial directory separator character (<code>/</code>). All filesystem entries, including [[Mount (computing)|mounted]] [[filesystem]]s are \"branches\" of this root.\n\nUnder [[DOS]], [[OS/2]], and [[Microsoft Windows]], each [[Disk partition|partition]] has a [[drive letter assignment]] (labeled <code>C:\\</code> for a particular partition C) and there is no common root directory above that. DOS, OS/2, and Windows do support more abstract hierarchies, with partitions mountable within a directory of another drive, though this is rarely seen. This has been possible in DOS through the command <code>JOIN</code> since it first was added to DOS, and can be achieved in all Windows versions as well. In some contexts, it is also possible to refer to a root directory containing all mounted drives, although it cannot contain files directly as it does not exist on any file system. For instance, when linking to a local file using the \"file:\" [[URI scheme]], the syntax is of the form \"<code>file:///C:/...</code>\", where \"<code>file://</code>\" is the standard prefix, and the third '<code>/</code>' represents the root of the local system.\n\nIn UNIX-like operating systems, each [[Process (computing)|process]] has its own idea of what the root directory is.  For most processes this is the same as \u2014the system's act\u2248\u2265ual root directory, but it can be changed by calling the <tt>[[chroot]]</tt> [[system call]].  This is typically done to create secluded environment to run software that requires legacy libraries and sometimes to simplify software installation and debugging. Chroot is not meant to be used for enhanced security as the processes inside can break out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/252794/ |title=What chroot() is really for |publisher=Lwn.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-12}}</ref> FreeBSD offers a stronger [[FreeBSD jail|jail()]] system call that enables [[operating-system-level virtualization]] and also serves security purposes to restrict which files a process may access to just a subset of the file system hierarchy.\n\n==Super-root==\nSome Unix systems support a directory below the root directory. Normally, \"/..\" points back to the same inode as \"/\", however, under {{Interlanguage link multi|MUNIX|de}}, this can be changed to point to a super-root directory, where remote trees can be mounted.<ref name=\"Newcastle_1982\">{{cite journal |title=The Newcastle Connection |author-last1=Brownbridge |author-first1=David R. |author-last2=Marshall |author-first2=Lindsay F. |author-last3=Randell |author-first3=Brian |author-link3=Brian Randell |journal=Software \u2013 Practice and Experience |volume=12 |year=1982 |doi=10.1002/spe.4380121206 |pages=1147\u20131162 |url=http://www.cs.ncl.ac.uk/publications/articles/papers/399.pdf |access-date=2016-08-16 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816184205/http://www.cs.ncl.ac.uk/research/pubs/articles/papers/399.pdf |archive-date=2016-08-16}}</ref><ref name=\"Callaghan_2000\">{{cite book |author-last=Callaghan |author-first=Brent |title=NFS Illustrated |publisher=[[Addison Wesley]] |year=2000 |isbn=0-201-32570-5}}</ref>  If, for example, two workstations \"pcs2a\" and \"pcs2b\" were connected via \"connectnodes\" and \"uunite\" startup script, \"/../pcs2b\" could be used to access the root directory of \"pcs2b\" from \"pcs2a\". {{Seealso|Newcastle Connection|Network block device}}\n\n==Related uses==\n; /root\n: On many [[Unix]]es, there is also a directory named <tt>[[/root]]</tt>.
