Inductors are typically manufactured from coils of wire. This design delivers two desired properties, a concentration of the magnetic field into a small physical space and a linking of the magnetic field into the circuit multiple times.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe relationship between the self-inductance, ''L'', of an electrical circuit, the voltage, ''v(t)'', and the current, ''i(t)'', through the circuit is\n:<math>\\displaystyle v(t) = L\\,\\frac{di}{dt}</math>.\nA voltage is induced across an inductor ([[back EMF]]), that is equal to the product of the inductor's inductance and the rate of change of current through the inductor.\n\nAll circuits have, in practice, some inductance, which may have beneficial or detrimental effects. For a [[tuned circuit]], inductance is used to provide a frequency-selective circuit. Practical inductors may be used to provide filtering, or energy storage, in a given network. The inductance per unit length of a [[transmission line]] is one of the properties that determines its [[characteristic impedance]]; balancing the inductance and capacitance of cables is important for distortion-free [[telegraphy]] and [[telephony]]. The inductance of long AC power transmission lines affects the power capacity of the line. Sensitive circuits, such as [[microphone]] and [[computer network]] cables, may utilize special cabling construction, limiting the [[inductive coupling]] between circuits.\n\nThe generalization to the case of ''K'' electrical circuits with currents, {''i<sub>m</sub>''}, and voltages, {''v<sub>m</sub>''}, reads\n:<math>\\displaystyle v_m = \\sum\\limits_{n=1}^K L_{m,n}\\,\\frac{di_n}{dt}.</math>\n\nHere, inductance ''L'' is a symmetric matrix. The diagonal coefficients ''L<sub>m,m</sub>'' are called coefficients of self-inductance, the off-diagonal elements are called coefficients of mutual inductance. The coefficients of inductance are constant, as long as no magnetizable material with nonlinear characteristics is involved. This is a direct consequence of the linearity of [[Maxwell's equations]] in the fields and the current density. The coefficients of inductance become functions of the currents in the [[#nonlinear inductance|nonlinear case]].\n\n==Derivation from Faraday's law of inductance==\nThe inductance equations above are a consequence of [[Maxwell's equations]]. There is a straightforward derivation in the important case of electrical circuits consisting of thin wires.\n\nIn a system of ''K'' wire loops, each with one or several wire turns, the [[flux linkage]] of loop ''m'', ''\u03bb{{sub|m}}'', is given by\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\lambda_m = N_m \\Phi_m = \\sum\\limits_{n=1}^K L_{m,n}i_n.</math>\n\nHere ''N<sub>m</sub>'' denotes the number of turns in loop ''m''; \u03a6''<sub>m</sub>'', the [[magnetic flux]] through loop ''m''; and ''L<sub>m,n</sub>'' are some constants. This equation follows from [[Ampere's law]] - magnetic fields and fluxes are linear functions of the currents. By [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]] of induction, we have\n:<math>\\displaystyle v_m = \\frac{d\\lambda_m}{dt} = N_m \\frac{d\\Phi_m}{dt} = \\sum\\limits_{n=1}^K L_{m,n}\\frac{di_n}{dt},</math>\nwhere ''v<sub>m</sub>'' denotes the voltage induced in circuit ''m''. This agrees with the definition of inductance above if the coefficients ''L<sub>m,n</sub>'' are identified with the coefficients of inductance. Because the total currents ''N<sub>n</sub>i<sub>n</sub>'' contribute to \u03a6''<sub>m</sub>'' it also follows that ''L<sub>m,n</sub>'' is proportional to the product of turns ''N<sub>m</sub>N<sub>n</sub>''.\n\n==Inductance and magnetic field energy==\nMultiplying the equation for ''v<sub>m</sub>'' above with ''i<sub>m</sub>dt'' and summing over ''m'' gives the energy transferred to the system in the time interval ''dt'',\n:<math>\\displaystyle\n  \\sum \\limits_m^K i_m v_m dt = \\sum\\limits_{m,n=1}^K i_m L_{m,n} di_n\n    \\overset{!}{=} \\sum\\limits_{n=1}^K \\frac{\\partial W \\left(i\\right)}{\\partial i_n} di_n.\n</math>\n\nThis must agree with the change of the magnetic field energy, ''W'', caused by the currents.<ref>The kinetic energy of the drifting electrons is many orders of magnitude smaller than W, except for nanowires.</ref> The [[symmetry of second derivatives|integrability condition]]\n:<math>\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial^2 W}{\\partial i_m \\partial i_n} = \\frac{\\partial^2 W}{\\partial i_n \\partial i_m}</math>\n\nrequires ''L<sub>m,n</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;L<sub>n,m</sub>''. The inductance matrix, ''L<sub>m,n</sub>'', thus is symmetric. The integral of the energy transfer is the magnetic field energy as a function of the currents,\n:<math>\\displaystyle W\\left(i\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum \\limits_{m,n=1}^K i_m L_{m,n} i_n.</math>\n\nThis equation also is a direct consequence of the linearity of Maxwell's equations. It is helpful to associate changing electric currents with a build-up or decrease of magnetic field energy. The corresponding energy transfer requires or generates a voltage. A [[impedance analogy|mechanical analogy]] in the ''K''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 case with magnetic field energy (1/2)''Li''<sup>2</sup> is a body with mass ''M'', velocity ''u'' and kinetic energy (1/2)''Mu''<sup>2</sup>. The rate of change of velocity (current) multiplied with mass (inductance) requires or generates a force (an electrical voltage).\n\n==Coupled inductors and mutual inductance==\n{{Further|Coupling (electronics)}}\n\n[[Image:Mutually inducting inductors.PNG|thumb|300px|right|The circuit diagram representation of mutually coupled inductors.\n\nThe two vertical lines between the inductors indicate a ''solid core'' that the wires of the inductor are wrapped around. \"n:m\" shows the ratio between the number of windings of the left inductor to windings of the right inductor. This picture also shows the [[dot convention]].]]\n\n'''Mutual inductance''' occurs when the change in current in one inductor induces a voltage in another nearby inductor. It is important as the mechanism by which [[transformer]]s work, but it can also cause unwanted coupling between conductors in a circuit.\n\nThe mutual inductance, ''M'', is also a measure of the coupling between two inductors. The mutual inductance by circuit ''i'' on circuit ''j'' is given by the double integral ''[[Franz Ernst Neumann|Neumann]] formula'', see [[#Calculation techniques|calculation techniques]]\n\nThe mutual inductance also has the relationship:\n:<math>M_{21} = N_1 N_2 P_{21} \\!</math>\nwhere\n:<math>M_{21}</math> is the mutual inductance, and the subscript specifies the relationship of the voltage induced in coil 2 due to the current in coil 1.\n:''N''<sub>1</sub> is the number of turns in coil 1,\n:''N''<sub>2</sub> is the number of turns in coil 2,\n:''P''<sub>21</sub> is the [[permeance]] of the space occupied by the flux.\n\nThe mutual inductance also has a relationship with the coupling coefficient. The coupling coefficient is always between \u22121 and 1, and is a convenient way to specify the relationship between a certain orientation of inductors with arbitrary inductance:\n\n:<math>M = k \\sqrt{L_1 L_2} \\! </math>\nwhere\n:''k'' is the ''coupling coefficient'' and \u22121&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''k''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;1,\n:''L''<sub>1</sub> is the inductance of the first coil, and\n:''L''<sub>2</sub> is the inductance of the second coil.\n\nOnce the mutual inductance, ''M'', is determined from this factor, it can be used to predict the behavior of a circuit:\n:<math> v_1 = L_1 \\frac{di_1}{dt} - M \\frac{di_2}{dt} </math>\nwhere\n:''v''<sub>1</sub> is the voltage across the inductor of interest,\n:''L''<sub>1</sub> is the inductance of the inductor of interest,\n:d''i''<sub>1</sub>/d''t'' is the derivative, with respect to time, of the current through the inductor of interest,\n:d''i''<sub>2</sub>/d''t'' is the derivative, with respect to time, of the current through the inductor that is coupled to the first inductor, and\n:''M'' is the mutual inductance.\n\nThe minus sign arises because of the sense the current ''i''<sub>2</sub> has been defined in the diagram. With both currents defined going into the dots the sign of M will be positive (the equation would read with a plus sign instead).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mahmood Nahvi |author2=Joseph Edminister |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nrxT9Qjguk8C&pg=PA338|title= Schaum's outline of theory and problems of electric circuits|page=338|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2002|isbn=0-07-139307-2}}</ref>\n\n===Matrix representation===\nThe circuit can be described by any of the [[two-port network]] parameter matrix representations. The most direct are the [[z parameters]], which are given by\n\n:<math> [\\mathbf z] = s \\begin{bmatrix} L_1 \\ M \\\\ M \\ L_2 \\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nwhere ''s'' is the [[complex frequency]] variable.\n\n===Equivalent circuit===\n[[File:Mutual inductance equivalent circuit.svg|thumb|Equivalent circuit of mutually coupled inductors]]\nMutually coupled inductors can equivalently be represented by a T-circuit of inductors as shown. If the coupling is strong and the inductors are of unequal values then the series inductor on the step-down side may take on a negative value.\n\nThis can be analyzed as a two port network. With the output terminated with some arbitrary impedance, ''Z'', the voltage gain, ''A''<sub>v</sub>, is given by,\n\n:<math> A_\\mathrm v = \\frac {sMZ}{s^2 L_1 L_2 - s^2 M^2 + sL_1 Z} </math>\n\nFor tightly coupled inductors where {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 1}} this reduces to\n\n:<math> A_\\mathrm v = \\sqrt {L_2 \\over L_1} </math>\n\nwhich is independent of the load impedance. If the inductors are wound on the same core and with the same geometry, then this expression is equal to the turns ratio of the two inductors because inductance is proportional to the square of turns ratio.\n\nThe input impedance of the network is given by,\n\n:<math> Z_\\mathrm {in} = \\frac {s^2 L_1 L_2 -s^2 M^2 + s L_1 Z}{sL_2 + Z}</math>\n\nFor {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 1}} this reduces to\n\n:<math> Z_\\mathrm {in} = \\frac {s L_1 Z}{sL_2 + Z} </math>\n\nThus, the current gain, ''A''<sub>i</sub> is ''not'' independent of load unless the further condition\n\n:<math> |sL_2| \\gg |Z| </math>\n\nis met, in which case,\n\n:<math> Z_\\mathrm {in} \\approx {L_1 \\over L_2} Z </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math> A_\\mathrm i \\approx \\sqrt {L_1 \\over L_2} = {1 \\over A_\\mathrm v} </math>\n\n===Tuned transformer===\n\nWhen either side of the transformer is a [[tuned circuit]], the amount of mutual inductance between the two windings, together with the [[Q factor]] of the circuit, determine the shape of the frequency response curve. The tuned circuit together with the transformer load form an [[RLC circuit]] with a definite peak in the frequency response. When both sides of the transformer are tuned, it is described as [[double-tuned amplifier|double-tuned]]. The coupling of double-tuned circuits is described as loose-, critical-, or over-coupled depending on the value of ''k''. When two tuned circuits are loosely coupled through mutual inductance, the bandwidth will be narrow. As the amount of mutual inductance increases, the bandwidth continues to grow. When the mutual inductance is increased beyond a critical point, the peak in the response curve begins to drop, and the center frequency will be attenuated more strongly than its direct sidebands. This is known as overcoupling.\n\n===Ideal transformers===\nWhen ''k'' = 1, the inductor is referred to as being closely coupled. If in addition, the self-inductances go to infinity, the inductor becomes an ideal [[transformer]]. In this case the voltages, currents, and number of turns can be related in the following way:\n\n:<math>V_\\text{s} = \\frac{N_\\text{s}}{N_\\text{p}} V_\\text{p} </math>\nwhere\n:''V''<sub>s</sub> is the voltage across the secondary inductor,\n:''V''<sub>p</sub> is the voltage across the primary inductor (the one connected to a power source),\n:''N''<sub>s</sub> is the number of turns in the secondary inductor, and\n:''N''<sub>p</sub> is the number of turns in the primary inductor.\n\nConversely the current:\n\n:<math>I_\\text{s} = \\frac{N_\\text{p}}{N_\\text{s}} I_\\text{p} </math>\nwhere\n:''I''<sub>s</sub> is the current through the secondary inductor,\n:''I''<sub>p</sub> is the current through the primary inductor (the one connected to a power source),\n:''N''<sub>s</sub> is the number of turns in the secondary inductor, and\n:''N''<sub>p</sub> is the number of turns in the primary inductor.\n\nNote that the power through one inductor is the same as the power through the other. Also note that these equations don't work if both inductors are forced (with power sources).\n\n==Calculation techniques==\nIn the most general case, inductance can be calculated from Maxwell's equations. Many important cases can be solved using simplifications. Where high frequency currents are considered, with [[skin effect]], the surface current densities and magnetic field may be obtained by solving the Laplace equation. Where the conductors are thin wires, self-inductance still depends on the wire radius and the distribution of the current in the wire. This current distribution is approximately constant (on the surface or in the volume of the wire) for a wire radius much smaller than other length scales.\n\n===Mutual inductance of two wire loops===\n\nThe mutual inductance by a filamentary circuit ''m'' on a filamentary circuit ''n'' is given by the double integral ''[[Franz Ernst Neumann|Neumann]] formula''<ref>{{cite journal | title = Allgemeine Gesetze der inducirten elektrischen Str\u00f6me | journal = Abhandlungen der K\u00f6niglichen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin, aus dem Jahre 1845 | year = 1847 | first = F.

See a [[Derivation of self inductance|derivation of this equation]].\n\n===Self-inductance of a wire loop===\nFormally, the self-inductance of a wire loop would be given by the above equation with ''m'' = ''n''. The problem, however, is that ''1/|'''x'''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;'''x''''|'' now becomes infinite, leading to a logarithmically divergent integral. This necessitates taking the finite wire radius ''a'' and the distribution of the current in the wire into account. There remain the contribution from the integral over all points with ''|'''x'''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;'''x''''|'' > ''a''/2 and a correction term,<ref name=\"den12\">{{cite journal | title = Self inductance of a wire loop as a curve integral | journal = Advanced Electromagnetics | year = 2016 | first = R. | last = Dengler | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u20138 | bibcode=  2016AdEl....5....1D|doi= 10.7716/aem.v5i1.331}}</ref>\n\n:<math> L = \\left (\\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\oint_{C}\\oint_{C'} \\frac{d\\mathbf{x}\\cdot d\\mathbf{x}'}{|\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}'|}\\right )_{|\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}'| > \\frac{a}{2}} + \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi}lY + O\\left( \\mu_0 a \\right ).</math>\n\nHere ''a'' and ''l'' denote the radius and length of the wire, and ''Y'' is a constant that depends on the distribution of the current in the wire: ''Y'' = 0 when the current flows in the surface of the wire ([[skin effect]]), ''Y'' = 1/2 when the current is homogeneous across the wire. The error ''O(''\u03bc<sub>0</sub>''a)'' is small when the wire is long compared to its radius.\n\n===Method of images===\nIn some cases, different current distributions generate the same magnetic field in some section of space. This fact may be used to relate self inductances ([[method of images]]). As an example, consider the two systems:\n* A wire at distance ''d/2'' in front of a perfectly conducting wall (which is the return)\n* Two parallel wires at distance ''d'', with opposite current\n\nThe magnetic field of the two systems coincides (in a half space). The magnetic field energy and the inductance of the second system thus are twice as large as that of the first system.\n\n===Relation between inductance and capacitance===\nInductance per length L' and [[capacitance]] per length C' are related to each other in the special case of [[transmission lines]] consisting of two parallel perfect conductors of arbitrary but constant cross section,<ref name=\"class_electro75\">{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=J.

Signals will propagate along the transmission line at the speed of electromagnetic radiation in the non-conductive medium enveloping the conductors.\n\n==Self-inductance of simple electrical circuits in air==\n{{See also|Inductor#Inductance formulas}}\nThe self-inductance of many types of electrical circuits can be given in closed form.

Ignoring end effects, the total magnetic flux through the coil is obtained by multiplying the flux density <math>B</math> by the cross-section area <math>A</math>:\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\Phi = \\frac{\\mu_0 N i A}{l},</math>\n\nWhen this is combined with the definition of inductance,\n:<math>\\displaystyle L = \\frac{N \\Phi}{i}</math>\n\nit follows that the inductance of a solenoid is given by:\n:<math>\\displaystyle L = \\frac{\\mu_0N^2A}{l}.</math>\n\nA table of inductance for short solenoids of various diameter to length ratios has been calculated by Dellinger, Whittmore, and Ould.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Xn8KbsgeFrwC&pg=PA248#v=onepage&q=&f=false\n | title = Radio Instruments and Measurements\n |author1=D.

For rigid air-core coils, inductance is a function of coil geometry and number of turns, and is independent of current.\n\nSimilar analysis applies to a solenoid with a magnetic core, but only if the length of the coil is much greater than the product of the relative permeability of the magnetic core and the diameter. That limits the simple analysis to low-permeability cores, or extremely long thin solenoids. Although rarely useful, the equations are,\n:<math>\\displaystyle B = \\frac{\\mu_0\\mu_r Ni}{l}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu_r</math> the relative permeability of the material within the solenoid,\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\Phi = \\frac{\\mu_0\\mu_rNiA}{l},</math>\n\nfrom which it follows that the inductance of a solenoid is given by:\n:<math>\\displaystyle L = \\frac{\\mu_0\\mu_rN^2A}{l}.</math>\n\nwhere N is squared because of the definition of inductance.\n\nNote that, since the permeability of ferromagnetic materials changes with applied magnetic flux, the inductance of a coil with a ferromagnetic core will generally vary with current.\n\n===Inductance of a coaxial line===\nLet the inner conductor have radius <math>r_i</math> and [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] <math>\\mu_i</math>, let the dielectric between the inner and outer conductor have permeability <math>\\mu_d</math>, and let the outer conductor have inner radius <math>r_{o1}</math>, outer radius <math>r_{o2}</math>, and permeability <math>\\mu_o</math>. Assume that a DC current <math>I</math> flows in opposite directions in the two conductors, with uniform current density. The magnetic field generated by these currents points in the azimuthal direction and is a function of radius <math>r</math>; it can be computed using [[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law|Amp\u00e8re's law]]:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n          0 \\leq r \\leq r_i: B(r) &= \\frac{\\mu_i I r}{2 \\pi r_i^2} \\\\\n     r_i \\leq r \\leq r_{o1}: B(r) &= \\frac{\\mu_d I}{2 \\pi r} \\\\\n  r_{o1} \\leq r \\leq r_{o2}: B(r) &= \\frac{\\mu_o I}{2 \\pi r} \\left( \\frac{r_{o2}^2 - r^2}{r_{o2}^2 - r_{o1}^2} \\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe flux per length <math>l</math> in the region between the conductors can be computed by drawing a surface containing the axis:\n\n:<math>\\frac{d\\phi_d}{dl} = \\int_{r_i}^{r_{o1}} B(r) dr = \\frac{\\mu_d I}{2 \\pi} \\ln\\frac{r_{o1}}{r_i} </math>\n\nInside the conductors, L can be computed by equating the energy stored in an inductor, <math>\\frac{1}{2}LI^2</math>, with the energy stored in the magnetic field:\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{2}LI^2 = \\int_V \\frac{B^2}{2\\mu} dV</math>\n\nFor a cylindrical geometry with no <math>l</math> dependence, the energy per unit length is\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{2}L'I^2 = \\int_{r_1}^{r_2} \\frac{B^2}{2\\mu} 2 \\pi r~dr</math>\n\nwhere <math>L'</math> is the inductance per unit length. For the inner conductor, the integral on the right-hand-side is <math>\\frac{\\mu_i I^2}{16 \\pi}</math>; for the outer conductor it is\n:<math>\\frac{\\mu_o I^2}{4 \\pi} \\left( \\frac{r_{o2}^2}{r_{o2}^2 - r_{o1}^2} \\right)^2 \\ln\\frac{r_{o2}}{r_{o1}} - \\frac{\\mu_o I^2}{8 \\pi} \\left( \\frac{r_{o2}^2}{r_{o2}^2 - r_{o1}^2} \\right) - \\frac{\\mu_o I^2}{16 \\pi}</math>\n\nSolving for <math>L'</math> and summing the terms for each region together gives a total inductance per unit length of:\n\n:<math>L' = \\frac{\\mu_i}{8 \\pi} + \\frac{\\mu_d}{2 \\pi} \\ln\\frac{r_{o1}}{r_i} + \\frac{\\mu_o}{2 \\pi} \\left( \\frac{r_{o2}^2}{r_{o2}^2 - r_{o1}^2} \\right)^2 \\ln\\frac{r_{o2}}{r_{o1}} - \\frac{\\mu_o}{4 \\pi} \\left( \\frac{r_{o2}^2}{r_{o2}^2 - r_{o1}^2} \\right) - \\frac{\\mu_o}{8 \\pi}</math>\n\nHowever, for a typical coaxial line application, we are interested in passing (non-DC) signals at frequencies for which the resistive [[skin effect]] cannot be neglected. In most cases, the inner and outer conductor terms are negligible, in which case one may approximate\n\n:<math>L' = \\frac{dL}{dl} \\approx \\frac{\\mu_d}{2 \\pi} \\ln\\frac{r_{o1}}{r_i}</math>\n\n==Phasor circuit analysis and impedance==\n\nIf signals of current and voltage are sine, using [[Phasor (electronics)|phasors]], the equivalent [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of an inductance is given by:\n:<math>Z_L = \\frac{V}{I} = j \\omega L \\, </math>\n\nwhere\n: ''j'' is the [[imaginary unit]],\n: ''L'' is the inductance,\n: ''\u03c9 = 2\u03c0f'' is the [[angular frequency]],\n: ''f'' is the [[frequency]] and\n: ''\u03c9L = X<sub>L</sub>'' is the inductive [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]].\n\n==Nonlinear inductance==\nMany inductors make use of [[magnetic materials]]. These materials over a large enough range exhibit a nonlinear permeability with such effects as [[saturation (magnetic)|saturation]]. In turn, the saturation makes the resulting inductance a function of the applied current. Faraday's Law still holds but inductance is ambiguous and is different whether you are calculating circuit parameters or magnetic fluxes.\n\nThe secant or large-signal inductance is used in flux calculations. It is defined as:\n\n:<math>L_s(i)\\ \\overset{\\underset{\\mathrm{def}}{}}{=} \\ \\frac{N\\Phi}{i} = \\frac{\\Lambda}{i}</math>\n\nThe differential or small-signal inductance, on the other hand, is used in calculating voltage. It is defined as:\n\n:<math>L_d(i)\\ \\overset{\\underset{\\mathrm{def}}{}}{=} \\ \\frac{d(N\\Phi)}{di} = \\frac{d\\Lambda}{di}</math>\n\nThe circuit voltage for a nonlinear inductor is obtained via the differential inductance as shown by Faraday's Law and the [[chain rule]] of calculus.\n\n:<math>v(t) = \\frac{d\\Lambda}{dt} = \\frac{d\\Lambda}{di}\\frac{di}{dt} = L_d(i)\\frac{di}{dt}</math>\n\nThere are similar definitions for nonlinear mutual inductances.\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin||20em}}\n* [[Alternating current]]\n* [[Dot convention]]\n* [[Eddy current]]\n* [[Electromagnetic induction]]\n* [[Electricity]]\n* [[Faraday's law of induction]]\n* [[Gyrator]]\n* [[Hydraulic analogy]]\n* [[Inductor]]\n* [[Leakage inductance]]\n* [[LC circuit]]\n* [[Magnetomotive force]] (MMF)\n* [[RLC circuit]]\n* [[RL circuit]]\n* [[SI electromagnetism units]]\n* [[Solenoid]]\n* [[Transformer]]\n* [[Kinetic inductance]]\n* [[LCR meter]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{More footnotes|date=September 2009}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==General references==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|author=Frederick W.
