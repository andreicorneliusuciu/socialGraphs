A space station is distinguished from other spacecraft used for [[human spaceflight]] by lack of major [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] or [[landing]] systems. Instead, other vehicles transport people and cargo to and from the station. {{as of|2016|09}} three space stations are in orbit: the [[International Space Station]], which is permanently manned, China's [[Tiangong-1]] (defunct) and [[Tiangong-2]] (launched 15 September 2016, not permanently manned).<ref>{{cite news |author= Morris Jones |url= http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Time_Enough_for_Tiangong_999.html |title= Time Enough for Tiangong |publisher= SpaceDaily |date= 12 July 2011 |accessdate= 2011-07-12 }}</ref><ref name=\"NASAspaceflight\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/09/china-major-human-space-flight-milestone-tiangong-1s-launch/|title=China launches TianGong-1 to mark next human space flight milestone |first=Rui |last=Barbosa |publisher=NASASpaceflight.com}}</ref> Previous stations include the [[Almaz]] and [[Salyut Program|Salyut series]], [[Skylab]], and most recently ''[[Mir]]''.\n\nToday's space stations are research platforms, used to study the effects of long-term space flight on the human body as well as to provide platforms for greater number and length of scientific studies than available on other space vehicles. Each crew member stays aboard the station for weeks or months, but rarely more than a year. Most of the time crew remain inside the space station but it's not necessary that crew should have to be stay inside the station. Since the ill-fated flight of [[Soyuz 11]] to [[Salyut 1]], all manned spaceflight duration records have been set aboard space stations. The [[List of spaceflight records#Ten longest human space flights|duration record for a single spaceflight]] is 437.7 days, set by [[Valeriy Polyakov]] aboard ''Mir'' from 1994 to 1995. {{As of|2016}}, four cosmonauts have completed single missions of over a year, all aboard ''Mir''.\n\nSpace stations have also been used for both military and civilian purposes. The last military-use space station was [[Salyut 5]], which was used by the [[Almaz]] program of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1976 and 1977.<ref>[[S:NASA FACTS/Russian Space Stations|Russian Space Stations (wikisource)]]</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early concepts ===\n[[File:The Brick Moon.gif|thumb|150px|The Brick Moon, first known depiction of a space station]]\n{{see also|History of spaceflight}}\n\nSpace stations have been envisaged since at least as early as 1869 when [[Edward Everett Hale]] wrote \"[[The Brick Moon]]\".<ref name=boys>[https://books.google.com/books?id=z2YEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA20 The First Space Station], Boy's Life, September 1989.</ref> The first to give serious consideration to space stations were [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] in the early 20th century and [[Hermann Oberth]] about two decades later.<ref name=boys /> In 1929 [[Herman Poto\u010dnik]]'s ''[[The Problem of Space Travel]]'' was published, the first to envision a \"rotating wheel\" space station to create artificial gravity.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], German scientists researched the theoretical concept of an [[orbital weapon]] based on a space station. Pursuing Oberth's idea of a space-based weapon, the so-called \"[[sun gun]]\" was a concept of a space station orbiting Earth at a height of {{convert|8200|km}}, with a weapon that was to utilize the sun's energy.<ref name=\"Time\">{{cite journal\n  | date = July 9, 1945\n  | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,852344-1,00.html\n  | title = Science: Sun Gun\n  | publisher = [[Time Magazine]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, in ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'', [[Wernher von Braun]] published his design for a [[rotating wheel space station]], which referenced Poto\u010dnik's idea \u2013 however these concepts would never leave the concept stage during the 20th century.<ref name=boys/> \n\nDuring the same time as von Braun pursued Poto\u010dnik's ideas, the Soviet design bureaus \u2013 chiefly [[Vladimir Chelomey]]'s [[OKB-52]] \u2013 were pursuing Tsiolkovsky's ideas for space stations. The work by OKB-52 would lead to the Almaz programme and (together with [[OKB-1]]) to the first space station: [[Salyut 1]]. The developed hardware laid the ground for the [[Salyut programme|Salyut and Mir space stations]], and is even today a considerable part of the [[International Space Station|ISS space station]].\n\n=== Salyut, Almaz, and Skylab (1971\u20131986) ===\n{{main|Salyut program|Almaz|Skylab}}\n[[File:Astronaut Owen Garriott Performs EVA During Skylab 3 - GPN-2002-000065.jpg|thumb|[[Owen Garriott]] on EVA in 1973]]\nThe first space station was [[Salyut 1]], which was launched by the [[Soviet Union]] on April 19, 1971. Like all the early space stations, it was \"monolithic\", intended to be constructed and launched in one piece, and then manned by a crew later. As such, monolithic stations generally contained all their supplies and experimental equipment when launched, and were considered \"expended\", and then abandoned, when these were used up.\n\nThe earlier Soviet stations were all designated \"Salyut\", but among these there were two distinct types: civilian and military. The military stations, [[Salyut 2]], [[Salyut 3]], and [[Salyut 5]], were also known as [[Almaz]] stations.\n\nThe civilian stations [[Salyut 6]] and [[Salyut 7]] were built with two docking ports, which allowed a second crew to visit, bringing a new spacecraft with them; the [[Soyuz 7K-T|Soyuz ferry]] could spend 90 days in space, after which point it needed to be replaced by a fresh Soyuz spacecraft.<ref name=MHH>{{cite web|url=http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/RP1357.pdf|title=Mir Hardware Heritage|author=D.S.F. Portree|publisher=NASA|year=1995|accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> This allowed for a crew to man the station continually. [[Skylab]] was also equipped with two docking ports, like second-generation stations, but the extra port was never utilized. The presence of a second port on the new stations allowed [[Progress spacecraft|Progress]] supply vehicles to be docked to the station, meaning that fresh supplies could be brought to aid long-duration missions. This concept was expanded on Salyut 7, which \"hard docked\" with a [[TKS spacecraft|TKS tug]] shortly before it was abandoned; this served as a proof-of-concept for the use of modular space stations. The later Salyuts may reasonably be seen as a transition between the two groups.\n\n=== ''Mir'' (1986\u20132001) ===\n\n{{main|Mir}}\n[[File:Mir during STS-74 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Earth and the ''Mir'' station]]\n\nUnlike previous stations, the Soviet space station ''[[Mir]]'' had a [[Modular design|modular]] design; a core unit was launched, and additional modules, generally with a specific role, were later added to that.  This method allows for greater flexibility in operation, as well as removing the need for a single immensely powerful [[launch vehicle]]. Modular stations are also designed from the outset to have their supplies provided by logistical support, which allows for a longer lifetime at the cost of requiring regular support launches.\n\n=== ISS (1998\u2013present) ===\n{{main|International Space Station}}\n\nThe core module of the International Space Station was launched in 1998.\n\nThe ISS is divided into two main sections, the [[Russia]]n orbital segment (ROS), and the [[United States]] operational segment (USOS).\n\nUSOS modules were brought to the station by the [[Space Shuttle]] and manually attached to the ISS by crews during [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVAs]]. Connections are made manually for electrical, data, propulsion and cooling fluids. This results in a single piece which is not designed for disassembly.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://search.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9794&page=28|isbn=0-309-06938-6|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2000|pages=28\u201330|author=Thomas Kelly|title=Engineering Challenges to the Long-Term Operation of the International Space Station|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n[[File:STS-116 spacewalk 1.jpg|thumb|ISS under construction]]\nThe Russian orbital segment's modules are able to launch, fly and dock themselves without human intervention using [[Proton (rocket)|Proton rockets]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usu.edu/mae/aerospace/publications/JDSC_RoadToAutonomy.pdf |title=Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering - mae.usu.edu |publisher=Usu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref> Connections are automatically made for power, data and propulsion fluids and gases. The Russian approach allows assembly of space stations orbiting other worlds in preparation for manned missions. The [[Nauka (ISS module)|Nauka module]] of the ISS will be used in the 12th Russian/Soviet space station, [[OPSEK]], whose main goal is supporting manned deep space exploration.\n\nRussian Modular or 'next generation' space stations differ from 'Monolithic' single piece stations by allowing reconfiguration of the station to suit changing needs. According to a 2009 report, [[RKK Energia]] is considering methods to remove from the station some modules of the Russian Orbital Segment when the end of mission is reached for the [[ISS]] and use them as a basis for a new station, known as the [[Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex]]. None of these modules would have reached the end of their useful lives in 2016 or 2020. The report presents a statement from an unnamed Russian engineer who believes that, based on the experience from ''Mir'', a thirty-year life should be possible, except for micrometeorite damage, because the Russian modules have been built with on-orbit refurbishment in mind.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8064060.stm|title=Russia 'to save its ISS modules'|publisher=BBC News|date=22 May 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009 | first=Anatoly | last=Zak}}</ref>\n\n=== Tiangong (2011\u2013present) ===\n{{main|Tiangong}}\n\nChina's first space laboratory, [[Tiangong-1]] was launched in September 2011. The unmanned [[Shenzhou 8]] then successfully performed an automatic rendezvous and docking in November 2011. The manned [[Shenzhou 9]] then docked with Tiangong-1 in June 2012, the manned [[Shenzhou 10]] in 2013. [[Tiangong 2]] was launched in September 2016 and another space laboratory, [[Tiangong 3]], is expected to be launched in subsequent years, paving the way for the construction of a [[Chinese space station|larger space station]] around 2020.\n\nIn September 2016 it was reported that the [[Tiangong-1]] is falling back to earth and will burn in the atmosphere during 2017.\n\n== Habitability ==\n{{main|Effect of spaceflight on the human body}}\nThese stations have various issues that limit their long-term habitability, such as very low recycling rates, relatively high radiation levels and a lack of weight. Some of these problems cause discomfort and long-term health effects. In the case of solar flares, all current habitats are protected by the Earth's magnetic field, and are below the [[Van Allen belts]].\n\nFuture [[space habitat]]s may attempt to address these issues, and could be intended for long-term occupation. Some designs might even accommodate large numbers of people, essentially \"cities in space\" where people would make their homes. No such design has yet been constructed, since even for a small station, the current (2016) launch costs are not economically or politically viable.\n\nPossible ways to deal with these costs would be to build a large number of rockets (economies of scale), employ reusable rockets, [[ISRU|In Situ Resource Utilisation]], or [[non-rocket spacelaunch]] methods such as [[space elevator]]s.  For example, in 1975, proposing to seek long-term habitability through [[artificial gravity]] and enough mass in space to allow high [[Space colonization#Radiation protection|radiation shielding]], the most ambitious historical [[NASA]] study, a conceptual 10000-person spacestation, envisioned a future [[mass driver]] base launching 600 times its own mass in lunar material cumulatively over years.<ref>[http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/75SummerStudy/Table_of_Contents1.html NASA, 1975: Space Settlements: A Design Study].
