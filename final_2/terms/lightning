This discharge occurs between [[electric charge|electrically charged]] regions of a [[thundercloud|cloud]] (called intra-cloud lightning or IC), between two clouds (CC lightning), or between a cloud and the ground (CG lightning). The charged regions in the atmosphere temporarily equalize themselves through this discharge referred to as a [[Lightning strike|''strike'']] if it hits an object on the ground, and a '''flash''', if it occurs within a cloud. Lightning causes light in the form of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], and sound in the form of  [[#Thunder|thunder]]. Lightning may be seen and not heard when it occurs at a distance too great for the sound to carry as far as the light from the strike or flash.\n\n==Understanding Lightning Electrification==\n[[File:Understanding Lightning - Figure 1 - Cloud Charging Area.gif|thumb|The main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly (updraft) and temperatures range from -15 to -25 Celsius]]\nThe details of the charging process are still being studied by scientists, but there is general agreement on some of the basic concepts of thunderstorm electrification.<ref> http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/science/science_electrification.shtml </ref> The main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly (updraft) and temperatures range from -15 to -25 Celsius, see figure to the right.   At that place, the combination of temperature and rapid upward air movement produces a mixture of super-cooled cloud droplets (small water droplets below freezing), small ice crystals, and soft hail (graupel). The updraft carries the super-cooled cloud droplets and very small ice crystals upward. At the same time, the graupel, which is considerably larger and denser, tends to fall or be suspended in the rising air.[[File:Graupel animation 3a.gif|thumb|left|When the rising ice crystals collide with graupel, the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel (soft hail) becomes negatively charged.]]\nThe differences in the movement of the precipitation cause collisions to occur. When the rising ice crystals collide with graupel (soft hail), the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged.  See figure to the left. The updraft carries the positively charged ice crystals upward toward the top of the storm cloud. The larger and denser graupel is either suspended in the middle of the thunderstorm cloud or falls toward the lower part of the storm.\n[[File:Charged cloud animation 4a.gif|thumb|The upper part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes positively charged while the middle to lower part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes negatively charged.]]\nThe result is that the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes positively charged while the middle to lower part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes negatively charged.  See figure to the right.\n\nThe upward motions within the storm and winds at higher levels in the atmosphere tend to cause the small ice crystals (and positive charge) in the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud to spread out horizontally some distance from thunderstorm cloud base. This part of the thunderstorm cloud is called the anvil. While this is the main charging process for the thunderstorm cloud, some of these charges can be redistributed by air movements within the storm (updrafts and downdrafts). In addition, there is a small but important positive charge buildup near the bottom of the thunderstorm cloud due to the precipitation and warmer temperatures.\n\n\n==General considerations==\n[[File:LightningCNP.ogg|thumb|left|Four-second video of a lightning strike, Island in the Sky, [[Canyonlands National Park]], [[Utah]], United States.]]\n\nOn Earth, the lightning frequency is approximately 40\u201350 times a second or nearly 1.4 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] flashes per year<ref name=\"EncyWorldClim freq\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-mwbAsxpRr0C&pg=PA452|title=Encyclopedia of World Climatology|accessdate=February 8, 2009|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|author=Oliver, John E.| isbn=978-1-4020-3264-6|date=2005}}</ref> and the average duration is 0.2 seconds made up from a number of much shorter flashes (strokes) of around 30 [[microsecond]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/lightning2.html|title=Lightning|work=gsu.edu|accessdate=December 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMany factors affect the frequency, distribution, strength and physical properties of a typical lightning flash in a particular region of the world. These factors include ground elevation, [[latitude]], [[prevailing wind]] currents, [[relative humidity]], proximity to warm and cold bodies of water, etc. To a certain degree, the ratio between IC, CC and CG lightning may also vary by [[season]] in [[middle latitudes]].\nBecause human beings are terrestrial and most of their possessions are on the Earth where lightning can damage or destroy them, CG lightning is the most studied and best understood of the three types, even though IC and CC are more common types of lightning. Lightning's relative unpredictability limits a complete explanation of how or why it occurs, even after hundreds of years of scientific investigation.\n\nA typical cloud to ground lightning flash culminates in the formation of an electrically conducting [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] channel through the air in excess of {{convert|5|km|mi}} tall, from within the cloud to the ground's surface.

This occurs from both the mixture of warmer and colder [[air mass]]es, as well as differences in moisture concentrations, and it generally happens at the [[Weather front|boundaries between them]]. The flow of warm ocean currents past drier land masses, such as the [[Gulf stream|Gulf Stream]], partially explains the elevated frequency of lightning in the [[Southeast United States]]. Because the influence of small or absent land masses in the vast stretches of the world's oceans limits the differences between these variants in the atmosphere, lightning is notably less frequent there than over larger landforms. The [[north pole|North]] and [[south pole|South Poles]] are limited in their coverage of thunderstorms and therefore result in areas with the least amount of lightning.\n\nIn general, cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning flashes account for only 25% of all total lightning flashes worldwide. Since the base of a thunderstorm is usually negatively charged, this is where most CG lightning originates. This region is typically at the elevation where [[freezing level|freezing]] occurs within the cloud. Freezing, combined with collisions between ice and water, appears to be a critical part of the initial charge development and separation process. During wind-driven collisions, ice crystals tend to develop a positive charge, while a heavier, slushy mixture of ice and water (called [[graupel]]) develops a negative charge. Updrafts within a storm cloud separate the lighter ice crystals from the heavier graupel, causing the top region of the cloud to accumulate a positive [[space charge]] while the lower level accumulates a negative space charge.\n\n[[File:2013-08-07 04-23-26-foudre-belfort.jpg|thumb|Lightning in [[Belfort]], [[France]]]]\n\nBecause the concentrated charge within the cloud must exceed the insulating properties of air, and this increases proportionally to the distance between the cloud and the ground, the proportion of CG strikes (versus cloud-to-cloud (CC) or in-cloud (IC) discharges) becomes greater when the cloud is closer to the ground. In the tropics, where the freezing level is generally higher in the atmosphere, only 10% of lightning flashes are CG. At the latitude of Norway (around 60\u00b0 North latitude), where the freezing elevation is lower, 50% of lightning is CG.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast05dec_1/|date=December 5, 2001|title=Where LightningStrikes|publisher=NASA Science.

P. R.|journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology|issue=4|bibcode = 1993JApMe..32..642S }}</ref>\n\nThe atmosphere provides the electrical insulation, or barrier, that prevents free equalization between charged regions of opposite polarity. This is overcome by \"lightning\", a complex process referred to as the lightning \"flash\".\n\n===Electrical field generation===\n[[File:LightningAboveCloudsView.JPG|thumb|View of lightning from an airplane flying above a system.]]\n\nAs a [[thundercloud]] moves over the surface of the Earth, an equal [[electric charge]], but of opposite polarity, is [[Electrostatic induction|induced]] on the Earth's surface underneath the cloud. The induced positive surface charge, when measured against a fixed point, will be small as the thundercloud approaches, increasing as the center of the storm arrives and dropping as the thundercloud passes. The referential value of the induced surface charge could be roughly represented as a bell curve.\n\nThe oppositely charged regions create an [[electric field]] within the air between them. This electric field varies in relation to the strength of the surface charge on the base of the thundercloud \u2013 the greater the accumulated charge, the higher the electrical field.\n\n== Flashes and strikes ==\nThe best studied and understood form of lightning is cloud to ground (CG). Although more common, intracloud (IC) and cloud to cloud (CC) flashes are very difficult to study given there are no \"physical\" points to monitor inside the clouds. Also, given the very low probability lightning will strike the same point repeatedly and consistently, scientific inquiry is difficult at best even in the areas of high CG frequency. As such, knowing flash propagation is similar amongst all forms of lightning, the best means to describe the process is through an examination of the most studied form, cloud to ground.[[File:Desert Electric.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A lightning strike from '''cloud to ground''' in the California, [[Mojave Desert]]]] \n[[File:Florescent cloud blanket.jpg|thumb|right|260px|An '''intracloud''' flash.

Leaders are electrically conductive channels of partially ionized gas that travel away from a region of dense charge. Negative leaders propagate away from densely charged regions of negative charge, and positive leaders propagate from positively charged regions.\n\nThe positively and negatively charged leaders proceed in opposite directions, positive upwards within the cloud and [[Electric charge|negative]] towards the earth. Both ionic channels proceed, in their respective directions, in a number of successive spurts. Each leader \"pools\" ions at the leading tips, shooting out one or more new leaders, momentarily pooling again to concentrate charged ions, then shooting out another leader.\n\nLeaders often split, forming branches in a tree-like pattern.<ref>Ultraslow-motion video of stepped leader propagation: [http://www.ztresearch.com/ ztresearch.com]</ref> In addition, negative leaders travel in a discontinuous fashion. The resulting jerky movement of these \"stepped leader(s)\" can be readily observed in slow-motion videos of negative leaders as they head toward ground prior to a negative CG lightning strike. The negative leaders continue to propagate and split as they head downward, often speeding up as they get closer to the Earth's surface.\n\nAbout 90% of ionic channel lengths between \"pools\" are approximately {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length.<ref>Goulde, R.H. (1977) \"The lightning conductor\", pp. 545\u2013576 in ''Lightning Protection'', R.H. Golde, Ed., ''Lightning, Vol. 2'', Academic Press.</ref> The establishment of the ionic channel takes a comparatively long amount of time (hundreds of [[millisecond]]s) in comparison to the resulting discharge, which occurs within a few microseconds. The [[electric current]] needed to establish the channel, measured in the tens or hundreds of [[ampere]]s, is dwarfed by subsequent currents during the actual discharge.\n\nInitiation of the outward leaders is not well understood. The electric field strength within the thundercloud is not typically large enough to initiate this process by itself.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11214-008-9338-z|title=Charge Structure and Dynamics in Thunderstorms|date=2008|last1=Stolzenburg|first1=Maribeth|last2=Marshall|first2=Thomas C.|journal=Space Science Reviews|volume=137|page=355|bibcode = 2008SSRv..137..355S }}</ref> Many hypotheses have been proposed. One theory postulates that showers of relativistic electrons are created by [[cosmic rays]] and are then accelerated to higher velocities via a process called [[runaway breakdown]].

The electric field is strongest on grounded objects whose tops are closest to the base of the thundercloud, such as trees and tall buildings. If the electric field is strong enough, a positively charged ionic channel, called a positive or upward streamer, can develop from these points. This was first theorized by Heinz Kasemir.<ref>Kasemir, H. W.

Photographs have been taken on which unattached streamers are clearly visible. The unattached downward leaders are also visible in branched lightning, none of which are connected to the earth, although it may appear they are.<ref>[[:File:Lightning hits tree.jpg]]</ref>\n\n=== Discharge ===\n\n====Return stroke====\n[[File:Lightnings sequence 2 animation.gif|thumb|High-speed photography showing different parts of a lightning flash during the discharge process as seen in [[Toulouse]], [[France]].]]\n\nOnce a conductive channel bridges the air gap between the negative charge excess in the cloud and the positive surface charge excess below, a massive electrical discharge follows. This is the 'return stroke' and it is the most [[Luminous intensity|luminous]] and noticeable part of the lightning discharge.\n\nA large electric current flows along the plasma channel from the cloud to the ground, neutralising the positive ground charge as electrons flow away from the strike point to the surrounding area. This huge surge of current creates large radial voltage differences along the surface of the ground. Called step potentials, they are responsible for more injuries and deaths than the strike itself.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Electricity takes every path available to it.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Path of Least Resistance|url=http://ecmweb.com/content/path-least-resistance}}</ref>\nA portion of the return stroke current will often preferentially flow through one leg and out another, electrocuting an unlucky human or animal standing near the point where the lightning strikes.\n\nThe electric current of the return stroke averages 30 kiloamperes for a typical negative CG flash, often referred to as \"negative CG\" lightning. In some cases, a positive ground to cloud (GC) lightning flash may originate from a positively charged region on the ground below a storm. These discharges normally originate from the tops of very tall structures, such as communications antennas. The rate at which the return stroke current travels has been found to be around 1{{e|8}} m/s.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Idone | first1 = V. P. | last2 = Orville | first2 = R.

The core temperature of the plasma during the return stroke may exceed 50,000 K, causing it to brilliantly radiate with a blue-white color. Once the electric current stops flowing, the channel cools and dissipates over tens or hundreds of milliseconds, often disappearing as fragmented patches of glowing gas. The nearly instantaneous heating during the return stroke causes the air to expand explosively, producing a powerful [[shock wave]] which is heard as [[#Thunder|thunder]].\n\n====Re-strike====\nHigh-speed videos (examined frame-by-frame) show that most negative CG lightning flashes are made up of 3 or 4 individual strokes, though there may be as many as 30.<ref>[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] Ch. 5, p. 41.</ref>\n\nEach re-strike is separated by a relatively large amount of time, typically 40 to 50 milliseconds, as other charged regions in the cloud are discharged in subsequent strokes. Re-strikes often cause a noticeable \"[[strobe light]]\" effect.<ref name=\"uman\">[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] pp. 103\u2013110.</ref>\n\nEach successive stroke is preceded by intermediate dart leader strokes that have a faster rise time but lower amplitude than the initial return stroke. Each subsequent stroke usually re-uses the discharge channel taken by the previous one, but the channel may be offset from its previous position as wind displaces the hot channel.<ref>[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] Ch. 9, p. 78.</ref>\n\n====Transient currents during flash====\nThe electric current within a typical negative CG lightning discharge rises very quickly to its peak value in 1\u201310 microseconds, then decays more slowly over 50\u2013200 microseconds. The transient nature of the current within a lightning flash results in several phenomena that need to be addressed in the effective protection of ground-based structures. Rapidly changing currents tend to travel on the surface of a conductor, in what is called the [[skin effect]], unlike direct currents, which \"flow through\" the entire conductor like water through a hose. Hence, conductors used in the protection of facilities tend to be multi-stranded, with small wires woven together. This increases the total bundle [[surface area]] in inverse proportion to the individual strand radius, for a fixed total [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional area]].\n\nThe rapidly changing currents also create [[Electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulses (EMPs)]] that radiate outward from the ionic channel. This is a characteristic of all electrical discharges. The radiated pulses rapidly weaken as their distance from the origin increases. However, if they pass over conductive elements such as power lines, communication lines, or metallic pipes, they may induce a current which travels outward to its termination. This is the \"[[Voltage spike|surge]]\" that, more often than not, results in the destruction of delicate [[electronics]], [[electrical appliance]]s, or [[electric motor]]s. Devices known as [[Surge protector|surge protectors (SPD) or transient voltage surge suppressors (TVSS)]] attached in parallel with these lines can detect the lightning flash's transient irregular current, and, through an alteration of its physical properties, route the spike to an attached [[Electrical ground|earthing ground]], thereby protecting the equipment from damage.\n\n== Types ==\nThere are three primary types of lightning, defined by what is at the \"ends\" of a flash channel. They are intracloud (IC), which occurs within a single thundercloud unit; cloud to cloud (CC), which starts and ends between two different \"functional\" thundercloud units; and cloud to ground (CG), that primarily originates in the thundercloud and terminates on an Earth surface, but may also occur in the reverse direction, that is ground to cloud. There are variations of each type, such as \"positive\" versus \"negative\" CG flashes, that have different physical characteristics common to each which can be measured. Different [[common name]]s used to describe a particular lightning event may be attributed to the same or different events.\n\n=== Cloud to ground (CG) ===\nCloud-to-ground is the best known and third most common type of lightning. It is the best understood of all forms because it allows for scientific study given it terminates on a physical object, namely the Earth, and lends itself to being measured by instruments. Of the three primary types of lightning, it poses the greatest threat to life and property since it terminates or \"strikes\" the Earth. Cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning is a lightning discharge between a thundercloud and the ground. It is usually negative in polarity and is usually initiated by a stepped leader moving down from the cloud.\n\n===={{anchor|Positive lightning}}Positive and negative lightning====\nCG lightning can occur with both positive and negative polarity. The polarity is that of the charge in the region that originated the lightning leaders. An average bolt of [[Electrical polarity|negative]] lightning carries an [[electric current]] of 30,000 [[ampere]]s (30 kA), and transfers 15 [[coulomb]]s of [[electric charge]] and 500 [[joule|megajoules]] of [[energy]]. Large bolts of lightning can carry up to 120 kA and 350 coulombs.<ref>Hasbrouck, Richard.

Since the sound waves propagate not from a single point source but along the length of the lightning's path, the sound origin's varying distances from the observer can generate a rolling or rumbling effect. Perception of the sonic characteristics is further complicated by factors such as the irregular and possibly branching geometry of the lightning channel, by [[echo (phenomenon)|acoustic echoing]] from terrain, and by the typically multiple-stroke characteristic of the lightning strike.\n\n[[Speed of light|Light travels]] at about 300,000,000&nbsp;m/s, and [[speed of sound|sound]] travels through air at about 340&nbsp;m/s. An observer can approximate the distance to the strike by timing the interval between the visible lightning and the audible thunder it generates. A lightning flash preceding its thunder by one second would be approximately {{convert|350|m|mi}} in distance; a delay of three seconds would indicate a distance of about {{convert|1|km|mi|sp=us|spell=in}} (3\u00d7340&nbsp;m). A flash preceding thunder by five seconds would indicate a distance of approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} (5\u00d7340&nbsp;m). Consequently, a lightning strike observed at a very close distance will be accompanied by a sudden clap of thunder, with almost no perceptible time lapse, possibly accompanied by the smell of [[ozone]] (O<sub>3</sub>).\n\n=== High-energy radiation ===\nThe production of [[X-ray]]s by a bolt of lightning was theoretically predicted as early as 1925<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = C.T.R. | date = 1925 | title = The acceleration of beta-particles in strong electric fields such as those of thunderclouds | journal = Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | volume = 22 |pages = 534\u2013538 |bibcode = 1925PCPS...22..534W |doi = 10.1017/S0305004100003236 | issue = 4 }}</ref> but no evidence was found until 2001/2002,<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = C.

Electromagnetic pulses transmitted by lightning strikes propagate within that waveguide. The waveguide is dispersive, which means that their [[group velocity]] depends on frequency. The difference of the group time delay of a lightning pulse at adjacent frequencies is proportional to the distance between transmitter and receiver. Together with direction finding methods, this allows to locate lightning strikes up to distances of 10,000&nbsp;km from their origin. Moreover, the eigenfrequencies of the Earth-ionospheric waveguide, the [[Schumann resonances]]\nat about 7.5&nbsp;Hz, are used to determine the global thunderstorm activity.<ref>Volland, H.

Scientists fired ultra-fast pulses from an extremely powerful laser thus sending several terawatts into the clouds to call down electrical discharges in storm clouds over the region. The laser beams sent from the laser make channels of ionized molecules known as \"'''filaments'''\". Before the lightning strikes earth, the filaments lead electricity through the clouds, playing the role of lightning rods. Researchers generated filaments that lived a period too short to trigger a real lightning strike. Nevertheless, a boost in electrical activity within the clouds was registered.
