The lock consists of a small chamber with two [[Hermetic seal|airtight]] [[door]]s in series which do not open simultaneously.\n\nAn airlock may be used for passage between environments of different gases rather than different pressures, to minimize or prevent the gases from mixing.\n\nAn airlock may also be used underwater to allow passage between an air environment in a pressure vessel and the water environment outside, in which case the airlock can contain air or water. This is called a '''floodable airlock''' or an '''underwater airlock''', and is used to prevent water from entering a [[submersible]] vessel or an [[underwater habitat]].\n\n==Use==\nBefore opening either door, the air pressure of the airlock\u2014the space between the doors\u2014is equalized with that of the environment beyond the next door to open. This is analogous to a waterway [[lock (water transport)|lock]]: a section of waterway with two watertight gates, in which the water level is varied to match the water level on either side.\n\nA gradual pressure transition minimizes air temperature fluctuations (see [[Boyle's law]]), which helps reduce fogging and condensation, decreases stresses on air seals, and allows safe verification of [[pressure suit]] and [[space suit]] operation.\n\nWhere a person who is not in a [[pressure suit]] moves between environments of greatly different pressures, an airlock changes the pressure slowly to help with [[Paranasal sinus|internal air cavity]] equalization and to prevent [[decompression sickness]]. This is critical in [[scuba diving]], and a diver may have to wait in an airlock for some hours, in accordance with [[decompression tables]].\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team (SDV) 2.jpg|thumb|right|US Navy submarine diving lock out, 2007.]]\nAirlocks are used in\n*[[aviation]], certain [[airplanes]] are equipped with airlocks for skydiving, and/or emergency exits.\n* [[spacecraft]] and [[space station]]s, to maintain the habitable environment when persons are exiting or entering the craft.\n* [[hyperbaric chamber]]s, to allow entry and exit while maintaining the pressure difference with the surroundings.\n* [[submarine]]s, [[diving chamber]]s, and [[underwater habitat]]s to permit divers to exit and enter.\n* [[torpedo tube]]s and [[escape trunk]]s in submarines are airlocks.\n* [[cleanroom]]s, protected environments in which dust, dirt particles, harmful chemicals, and other contaminants are excluded partially by maintaining the room at a higher pressure than the surroundings.\n* hazardous environments, such as [[nuclear reactor]]s and some [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] [[Laboratory|laboratories]], in which dust, particles, and/or biological agents are prevented from leaking out by maintaining the room at a lower pressure than the surroundings.\n* pressurized domes such as the [[USF Sun Dome]] where pressure loss would cause collapse of the structure.\n* [[electron microscopes]], where the interior is near vacuum so air does not affect the electron path.\n* [[Airlock (parachute)|parachute airlocks]], where airfoil collapse due to depressurization can result in dangerous loss of altitude.\n* fermentation vessels, where a [[fermentation lock]] allows [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] gases to escape while keeping air out, such as in breweries or wine-makers.\n\n==Similar mechanisms==\n* In cold climates, two doors arranged in an airlock configuration are common in building entrances.  While not airtight, the double doors minimize the loss of heated air from the building. A similar arrangement is common in hot climates, where it is used to keep interior spaces cool. [[Revolving door]]s may be used for the same purpose.\n* Some jewelry stores and banks have airlock-like doors to slow the escape of thieves.\n* Butterfly farms and [[aviary|aviaries]] usually have an airlock-like entrance to prevent the exit of inhabitants and entrance of predatory species.\n* [[Planetarium]]s may have 'light-locks' to minimize outside light, protecting visitors' sensitive [[Adaptation (eye)|dark adaptation]]. These pairs of doors also reduce outside sound.<ref>http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.ips-planetarium.org/resource/resmgr/pdf-pubs/pdg05PlanetariumEnvironment.pdf</ref><ref>http://planetarium.osu.edu/renovation</ref>\n\n==Fictional airlocks==\nA four-door airlock (with three interior chambers) was proposed by [[science fiction]] writer [[H. Beam Piper]] in his novel ''Uller Uprising''.  The atmosphere inside the fictional structure was human-breathable, while the outside atmosphere was highly toxic.  Only one door of the airlock opened at a time, and the middle chamber of the three would always contain a vacuum to minimize traces of the exterior atmosphere reaching the habitat.\n\nAirlocks are also used in the Bioshock game series for entrance and exit into water environments.\n\nAirlocks are commonly used in science fiction as a form of execution, often referred to as \"spacing\" or \"airlocking\".  [[Battlestar Galactica]] and the [[Honorverse]] books both make frequent use or reference to it.\n\nIn the film [[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]], James Bond dispatches of the villain Hugo Drax aboard his own space station by first shooting him in the chest with a cyanide dart, then pushing him out an airlock into space (\"Take a giant leap for mankind.\").\n\nIn [[Star Trek]], Star Wars and some other fiction genres, conventional airlocks may be replaced by forcefields which hold in air while allowing solid matter like spacecraft to pass through.  Airlocks of this type usually have pressure doors as a backup.\n\nAirlocks play a somewhat important role in [[The Martian (film)|The Martian]], as the failure of Mark Watney's Mars Habitat airlock and the subsequent depressurization of the environment kills the potato crops he was growing, exacerbating his situation of being marooned on Mars.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Fermentation lock]]\n* [[Revolving door]]\n* [[Sally port]]\n* [[Suitport]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat-inline|Airlocks}}\n\n{{Use American English|date=January 2014}}\n\n[[Category:Spacecraft components]]\n[[Category:Types of gates]]\n[[Category:Cleanroom technology]]"}]}}}}
