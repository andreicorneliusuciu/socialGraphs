The chemical reaction between the fuel and the oxidizer produces reactant products which are nominally gasses at the pressures and temperatures in the rocket's  combustion chamber.  The reaction is also highly energetic (exothermic) releasing tremendous energy in the form of heat; that is imparted to the reactant products in the combustion chamber giving this mass enormous internal energy which, when expanded through a [[nozzle]] is capable of producing very high exhaust velocities. The exhaust is directed rearward through the nozzle, thereby producing a thrust forward. \n\nIn this conventional design, the fuel/oxidizer mixture is both the [[working mass]] and energy source that accelerates it. It is easy to demonstrate that the best performance is had if the working mass is as low as possible. Hydrogen, by itself, is the theoretical best rocket fuel. Mixing this with oxygen in order to burn it lowers the overall performance of the system by raising the mass of the exhaust, as well as greatly increasing the mass that has to be carried aloft - oxygen is much heavier than hydrogen.\n\nOne method of increasing the overall performance of the system is to collect either the fuel or the oxidizer during flight. Fuel is hard to come by in the atmosphere, but oxidizer in the form of gaseous oxygen makes up to 20% of the air and there are a number of designs that take advantage of this fact. These sorts of systems have been explored in the [[liquid air cycle engine]] (LACE).\n\nAnother idea is to collect the working mass. With an air-augmented rocket, an otherwise conventional rocket engine is mounted in the center of a long tube, open at the front. As the rocket moves through the atmosphere the air enters the front of the tube, where it is compressed via the ram effect. As it travels down the tube it is further compressed and mixed with the fuel-rich exhaust from the rocket engine, which heats the air much as a combustor would in a [[ramjet]]. In this way a fairly small rocket can be used to accelerate a much larger working mass than normal, leading to significantly higher thrust within the atmosphere.\n\n===Advantages===\n\nThe effectiveness of this simple method can be dramatic. Typical solid rockets have a [[specific impulse]] of about 260 seconds (2.5 kN\u00b7s/kg), but using the same fuel in an air-augmented design can improve this to over 500 seconds (4.9 kN\u00b7s/kg), a figure even the best hydrogen/oxygen engines can't match. This design can even be slightly more efficient than a [[ramjet]] as the exhaust from the rocket engine compresses the air more than a ramjet normally would; this raises the combustion efficiency as a longer, more efficient nozzle can be employed. Another advantage is that the rocket works even at zero forward speed, whereas a ramjet requires forward motion to feed air into the engine.\n\n===Disadvantages===\n\nIt might be envisaged that such an increase in performance would be widely deployed, but various issues frequently preclude this. The intakes of high-speed engines are difficult to design, and they can't simply be located anywhere on the airframe whilst getting reasonable performance \u2013 in general the entire airframe needs to be built around the intake design. Another problem is that the air eventually runs out, so the amount of additional thrust is limited by how fast the rocket climbs. Finally, the air ducting weighs about 5\u00d7 to 10\u00d7 more{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} than an equivalent rocket that gives the same thrust. This slows the vehicle quite a bit towards the end of the burn.\n\n==History==\n\nThe first{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} serious attempt to make a production air-augmented rocket was the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] '''Gnom''' rocket design, implemented by Decree 708-336 of the Soviet Ministers of 2 July 1958. This was an [[ICBM]] whose performance was so improved{{citation needed|date=October 2012|reason=1950s-1960s was a peak of missile race, if the design would be of any use as ICBM, hundreds would have been made. But they were not, so was it that successful design?}}  that it weighed half that of conventional designs. This led to it being light enough, about 30 tonnes, that it could be mounted on the back of a large tank chassis and made fully transportable. Design and test work continued on the design throughout the early 1960s, but ended in 1965 when the chief designer died. \n\n[[Image:GTX-5880trefny-f2.jpg|thumb|NASA GTX Reference vehicle]]\nMore recently [[NASA]] has re-examined similar technology for the GTX program as part of an effort to develop [[SSTO]] spacecraft.\n\nMany modern solid fueled 'ramjet' powered missiles, such as the [[Meteor (missile)|MBDA Meteor]], may in fact be air augmented rockets,{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} and the distinction between a ramjet and an air augmented missile is rather blurred. Many solid fueled ramjet missiles seem to be solid fueled ramrockets in all but name.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Liquid air cycle engine]] - collecting oxidizer instead of working mass\n\n==External links==\n*[http://astronautix.com/lvs/gnom.htm Gnom]\n*[https://wayback.archive.org/web/20081122140310/http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/RT2002/5000/5880trefny.html NASA GTX]\n\n[[Category:Rocket propulsion]]\n[[Category:Ramjet engines]]\n[[Category:Industrial design]]\n[[Category:Soviet inventions]]"}]}}}}
