A non-solid or solid [[electrolyte]] which covers the surface of the oxide layer in principle serves as the second electrode ([[cathode]]) (-) of the capacitor.\n\nDue to their very thin dielectric oxide layer and enlarged anode surface, electrolytic capacitors have\u2014based on the volume\u2014a much higher [[capacitance]]-[[voltage]] (CV) product compared to [[ceramic capacitor]]s or [[film capacitor]]s, but a much smaller CV value than electrochemical [[supercapacitor]]s.\n\nThe large capacitance of electrolytic capacitors makes them particularly suitable for passing or bypassing low-frequency signals up to some mega-hertz and for storing large amounts of energy. They are widely used for decoupling or noise filtering in [[Power supply|power supplies]] and DC link circuits for [[variable-frequency drive]]s, for coupling signals between [[amplifier]] stages, and storing energy as in a [[flashlamp]].\n\nStandard electrolytic capacitors are polarized components due to their asymmetrical construction, and may only be operated with a higher voltage (ie, more positive) on the anode than on the cathode at all times. Voltages with reverse polarity, or voltage or ripple current higher than specified (as little as 1 or 1.5 volts may suffice), can destroy the dielectric and thus the capacitor. The destruction of electrolytic capacitors can have catastrophic consequences (explosion, fire).\n\nBipolar electrolytic (aka [[non-polarized]]) capacitors which may be operated with either polarity are special constructions with two anodes connected in series.\n\n==Basic information==\n\n===Electrolytic capacitors family tree===\nAs to the basic construction principles of electrolytic capacitors, there are three different types: aluminum, tantalum, and niobium capacitors. Each of these three capacitor families uses non-solid and solid manganese dioxide or solid polymer electrolytes, so a great spread of different combinations of anode material and solid or non-solid electrolytes is available.\n\n[[File:E-cap-family-14-02-02.jpg|thumb|400px|center| Depending on the nature of the anode metal used and the electrolyte used, there is a wide variety of electrolytic capacitors]]\n\n===Charge principle===\nLike other conventional capacitors, electrolytic capacitors store the [[electric energy]] [[Static electricity|statically]] by [[Electric charge|charge]] separation in an [[electric field]] in the dielectric oxide layer between two [[electrode]]s. The non-solid or solid [[electrolyte]] in principle is the cathode, which thus forms the second electrode of the capacitor. This and the storage principle distinguish them from electrochemical capacitors or [[supercapacitor]]s, in which the electrolyte generally is the ionic conductive connection between two electrodes and the storage occurs with statically [[double-layer capacitance]] and electrochemical [[pseudocapacitance]].\n\n===Basic materials and forming principle===\n[[File:Anodic oxidation.jpg|thumb|right|Basic principle of anodic oxidation (forming), in which, by applying a voltage with a current source, an oxide layer is formed on a metallic anode]]\n\nElectrolytic capacitors use a chemical feature of some special metals, earlier called \u201cvalve metals\u201d, on which by [[anodizing|anodic]] [[oxidation]] (forming) an insulating oxide layer originates and serves as dielectric. There are three different anode metals in use for electrolytic capacitors:\n# [[Aluminum electrolytic capacitor]]s use a high-purity etched [[aluminium]] foil with [[aluminium oxide]] as dielectric\n# [[Tantalum capacitor|Tantalum electrolytic capacitors]] use a sintered pellet (\u201cslug\u201d) of high-purity [[tantalum]] powder with [[tantalum pentoxide]] as dielectric\n# [[Niobium capacitor|Niobium electrolytic capacitors]] use a sintered \"slug\" of high-purity [[niobium]] or [[niobium oxide]] powder with [[niobium pentoxide]] as dielectric.\n\nAll anode materials are either etched or sintered and have a rough surface structure with a much higher surface area compared to a smooth surface of the same area or the same volume. By applying a positive voltage to the above-mentioned anode material in an electrolytic bath an oxide barrier layer with a thickness corresponding to the applied voltage will be formed (formation). This oxide layer acts as dielectric in an electrolytic capacitor. The properties of this oxide layers are given in the following table:\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Characteristics of the different oxide layers in aluminum, tantalum and niobium electrolytic capacitors<ref name=Nano>J.L.

This is accomplished by the electrolyte, which acts as the cathode electrode of an electrolytic capacitor. There are many different electrolytes in use. Generally they are distinguished into two species, \u201cnon-solid\u201d and \u201csolid\u201d electrolytes. As a liquid medium which has [[ion]] [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] caused by moving ions, non-solid electrolytes can easily fit the rough structures. Solid electrolytes which have electron conductivity can fit the rough structures with the help of special chemical processes like [[pyrolysis]] for [[manganese dioxide]] or [[polymerization]] for conducting [[polymer]]s.\n\nComparing the permittivities of the different oxide materials it is seen that tantalum pentoxide has a permittivity approximately three times higher than aluminum oxide. Tantalum electrolytic capacitors of a given CV value theoretically are therefore smaller than aluminium electrolytic capacitors. In practice different safety margins to reach reliable components makes a comparison difficult.\n\nThe anodically generated insulating oxide layer is destroyed if the polarity of the applied voltage changes.\n\n===Basic about C/V product===\n[[Image:Parallel plate capacitor.svg|thumb|right|A dielectric material is placed between two conducting plates (electrodes), each of area '''''A''''' and with separation '''''d'''''.]]\nEvery electrolytic capacitor forms on principle a \"plate capacitor\" whose capacitance is greater, the larger the electrode area A and the [[permittivity]] \u03b5, and the thinner the dielectric (d).\n\n:<math>C = \\varepsilon \\cdot \\frac{A}{d}</math>\n\nThe dielectric thickness of electrolytic capacitors is very slight, in the range of [[Meter|nanometers]] per volt. On the other hand, the voltage strengths of these oxide layers are quite high. With this very thin dielectric oxide layer combined with a sufficient high dielectric strength the electrolytic capacitors can already achieve a high volumetric capacitance. This is one reason for the high capacitance values of electrolytic capacitors compared to conventional capacitors.\n\nAll etched or sintered anodes have a much higher surface compared to a smooth surface of the same area or the same volume. That increases the later capacitance value, depending on the rated voltage, by a factor of up to 200 for non-solid aluminium electrolytic capacitors as well as for solid tantalum electrolytic capacitors.<ref name=Voltage>A.

Because the forming voltage defines the oxide layer thickness, the voltage proof of the later electrolytic capacitor can be produced very simply for the desired rated value. Therefore, the volume of a capacitor is defined by the product of capacitance and voltage, the so-called \"CV product\".\n\n===Basic construction of non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors===\n<center>\n<gallery perrow=\"3\" caption=\"Basic construction of a non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitor\" class=\"centered\" mode=packed heights=130px>\nFile:Al-e-cap-winding-multi-tabs.jpg|Opened winding of an e-cap with multiple connected foils\nFile: Elko-Prinzipschnittbild-english.png|Closeup cross-section of an aluminium electrolytic capacitor design, showing capacitor anode foil with oxide layer, paper spacer soaked with electrolyte, and cathode foil\nFile:Al-e-cap-construction.jpg| Construction of a typical single-ended aluminium electrolytic capacitor with non-solid electrolyte\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n===Basic construction of solid tantalum electrolytic capacitors===\n<center>\n<gallery perrow=\"3\" caption=\" Construction of a solid tantalum chip capacitor with manganese dioxide electrolyte\" class=\"centered\" mode=packed heights=150px>\nFile:Tantalum sintered pellet.jpg| The capacitor cell of a tantalum electrolytic capacitor consist out of sintered tantalum powder\nFile:Tantalum-Sintered-MnO2-slug.jpg| Schematic representation of the structure of a sintered tantalum electrolytic capacitor with solid electrolyte and the cathode contacting layers\nFile:Tantalum-SMD-Chip-Molded.jpg| Construction of a typical SMD tantalum electrolytic chip capacitor with solid electrolyte\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==Types and features of electrolytic capacitors==\n===Comparison of electrolytic capacitor types===\nCombinations of anode materials for electrolytic capacitors and the electrolytes used have given rise to wide varieties of capacitor types with different properties.

They not only provide the cheapest solutions for high capacitance or voltage values for decoupling and buffering purposes but are also insensitive to low ohmic charging and discharging as well as to low-energy transients. Non-solid electrolytic capacitors can be found in nearly all areas of electronic devices, with the exception of military applications.\n\nTantalum electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolyte as surface-mountable chip capacitors are mainly used in electronic devices in which little space is available or a low profile is required. They operate reliably over a wide temperature range without large parameter deviations. In military and space applications only tantalum electrolytic capacitors have the necessary approvals.\n\nNiobium electrolytic capacitors are in direct competition with industrial tantalum electrolytic capacitors because niobium is more readily available. Their properties are comparable.\n\nThe electrical properties of aluminum, tantalum and niobium electrolytic capacitors have been greatly improved by the polymer electrolyte.\n\n===Comparison of electrical parameters===\nIn order to compare the different characteristics of the different electrolytic capacitor types, capacitors with the same dimensions and of similar capacitance and voltage are compared in the following table. In such a comparison the values for ESR and ripple current load are the most important parameters for the use of electrolytic capacitors in modern electronic equipment. The lower the ESR, the higher the ripple current per volume and better functionality of the capacitor in the circuit. However, better electrical parameters come with higher prices.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Comparison of the most important characteristics of different types of electrolytic capacitors\n!

Tantalum electrolytic capacitors, usually used in the SMD version, have a higher specific capacitance than the aluminum electrolytic capacitors and are used in devices with limited space or flat design such as laptops. They are also used in military technology, mostly in axial style, hermetically sealed. Niobium electrolytic chip capacitors are a new development in the market and are intended as a replacement for tantalum electrolytic chip capacitors.\n\n<center>\n<gallery perrow=\"3\" caption=\"Different styles of aluminum electrolytic capacitors\" class=\"centered\" mode=packed heights=100px>\nFile:V-Chip-Elkos.png|Aluminum electrolytic SMD \"V\" (vertical) chip capacitors\nFile:Axial electrolytic capacitors.jpg|Axial style aluminum electrolytic capacitors\nFile:Single-ended-e-caps-IMG 5117.JPG|Radial or single-ended aluminum electrolytic capacitors\nFile:Snap-In Electrolytic Capacitor.jpg|Aluminum electrolytic capacitor with \"snap-in\" terminals\nFile:Screw-terminal-e-caps-IMG 5126.JPG|Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with screw terminals\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n<center>\n<gallery perrow=\"3\" caption=\"Different styles of tantalum electrolytic capacitors\" class=\"centered\" mode=packed heights=100px>\nFile:CMS tantalum capacitor.JPG| Typical tantalum SMD capacitor\nFile:Tantalum capacitors.jpg|Dipped lacquered tantalum \u201cpearl\u201d capacitors\nFile:Tantal-Elko-Axial-P1040292c.jpg|Axial style tantalum electrolytic capacitors\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Early electrolytic capacitor.jpg|thumb|Early small electrolytic capacitor from 1914.

He coined the term \"valve metal\" for such metals.\n\nCharles Pollak (born [[Karol Pollak]]), a producer of accumulators, found out that the oxide layer on an aluminum anode remained stable in a neutral or alkaline electrolyte, even when the power was switched off. In 1896 he filed a patent for an \"Electric liquid capacitor with aluminum electrodes\" (de: ''Elektrischer Fl\u00fcssigkeitskondensator mit Aluminiumelektroden'') based on his idea of using the oxide layer in a polarized capacitor in combination with a neutral or slightly alkaline electrolyte.<ref>Charles Pollack: D.R.P. 92564, filed 14.

For all of these anodes the outer metallic container served as the cathode]]\nThe first industrially realized electrolytic capacitors consisted of a metallic box used as the cathode. It was filled with a [[Sodium borate|borax]] electrolyte dissolved in water, in which a folded aluminum anode plate was inserted. Applying a DC voltage from outside, an oxide layer was formed on the surface of the anode. The advantage of these capacitors was that they were significantly smaller and cheaper than all other capacitors at this time relative to the realized capacitance value. This construction with different styles of anode construction but with a case as cathode and container for the electrolyte was used up to the 1930s and was called a \"wet\" electrolytic capacitor, in the sense of its having a high water content.\n\nThe first more common application of wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors was in large telephone exchanges, to reduce [[relay hash]] (noise) on the 48 volt DC power supply. The development of AC-operated domestic radio receivers in the late 1920s created a demand for large-capacitance (for the time) and high-voltage capacitors for the [[valve amplifier]] technique, typically at least 4 microfarads and rated at around 500 volts DC. Waxed paper and oiled silk [[film capacitor]]s were available, but devices with that order of capacitance and voltage rating were bulky and prohibitively expensive.\n\n===\"Dry\" aluminum capacitor===\n[[File:Dry Electrolytic capacitor, pic5.JPG|thumb|A \"dry\" electrolytic capacitor with 100&nbsp;\u00b5F and 150&nbsp;V]]\nThe [[ancestor]] of the modern electrolytic capacitor was patented by [[Samuel Ruben]] in 1925,<ref>US Patent Nr. 1774455, ''Electric condenser'', filed October 19, 1925, granted August 26, 1930</ref><ref>Samuel Ruben: Inventor, Scholar, and Benefactor by Kathryn R.

Rubens idea adopted the stacked construction of a [[silver mica capacitor]]. He introduced a separated second foil to contact the electrolyte adjacent to the anode foil instead of using the electrolyte-filled container as the capacitor's cathode. The stacked second foil got its own terminal additional to the anode terminal and the container no longer had an electrical function.

It was invented by [[Bell Laboratories]] in the early 1950s as a miniaturized, more reliable low-voltage support capacitor to complement their newly invented transistor. The solution found by R. L. Taylor and H. E. Haring of the Bell labs in early 1950 was based on experiences with ceramics. They ground tantalum to a powder, which they pressed into a cylindrical form and then sintered at high a temperature between 1500 and 2000&nbsp;\u00b0C under vacuum conditions to produce a pellet (\"slug\").<ref>R.

The materials and processes used to produce niobium-dielectric capacitors are essentially the same as for existing tantalum-dielectric capacitors. The characteristics of niobium electrolytic capacitors and tantalum electrolytic capacitors are roughly comparable.<ref>Y. Pozdeev-Freeman, P.

In these e-caps the water reacts quite aggressively and even violently with aluminum, accompanied by strong heat and gas development in the capacitor, and often led to the explosion of the capacitor.\n\n==Electrical characteristics==\n=== Series-equivalent circuit ===\n[[File:Electrolytic capacitor model.svg|thumb|Series-equivalent circuit model of an electrolytic capacitor]]\n\nThe electrical characteristics of capacitors are harmonized by the international generic specification IEC 60384-1. In this standard, the electrical characteristics of capacitors are described by an idealized series-equivalent circuit with electrical components which model all ohmic losses, capacitive and inductive parameters of an electrolytic capacitor:\n* ''C'', the capacitance of the capacitor\n* ''R''<sub>ESR</sub>, the [[equivalent series resistance]] which summarizes all ohmic losses of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as \"ESR\"\n* ''L''<sub>ESL</sub>, the [[equivalent series inductance]] which is the effective self-inductance of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as \"ESL\".\n* ''R''<sub>leak</sub>, the resistance representing the [[Leakage (electronics)|leakage current]] of the capacitor\n\n===Capacitance, standard values and tolerances===\n[[File:Capacitance versus frequency .tif|thumb|Typical capacitance as a function of frequency]]\n[[File:E-cap-capacitance versus temperature.jpg|thumb|Typical capacitance as a function of temperature]]\n\nThe electrical characteristics of electrolytic capacitors depend on the structure of the anode and the electrolyte used. This influences the capacitance value of electrolytic capacitors, which depends on measuring frequency and temperature. Electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes show a broader aberration over frequency and temperature ranges than do capacitors with solid electrolytes.\n\nThe basic unit of an electrolytic capacitor's capacitance is the [[Farad|microfarad]] (\u03bcF, or less correctly, uF). The capacitance value specified in the data sheets of the manufacturers is called the rated capacitance C<sub>R</sub> or nominal capacitance C<sub>N</sub> and is the value for which the capacitor has been designed.\n\nThe standardized measuring condition for e-caps is an AC measuring method with 0.5&nbsp;V at a frequency of 100/120&nbsp;Hz and a temperature of 20&nbsp;\u00b0C. For tantalum capacitors a DC bias voltage of 1.1 to 1.5&nbsp; V for types with a rated voltage \u22642.5&nbsp;V, or 2.1 to 2.5&nbsp;V for types with a rated voltage of >2.5&nbsp;V, may be applied during the measurement to avoid reverse voltage.\n\nThe capacitance value measured at the frequency of 1&nbsp;kHz is about 10% less than the 100/120&nbsp;Hz value. Therefore, the capacitance values of electrolytic capacitors are not directly comparable and differ from those of [[film capacitor]]s or [[ceramic capacitor]]s, whose capacitance is measured at 1&nbsp;kHz or higher.\n\nMeasured with an AC measuring method with 100/120&nbsp;Hz the capacitance value is the closest value to the electrical charge stored in the e-caps. The stored charge is measured with a special discharge method and is called the [[Direct current|DC]] capacitance. The DC capacitance is about 10% higher than the 100/120&nbsp;Hz AC capacitance. The DC capacitance is of interest for discharge applications like [[photoflash]].\n\nThe percentage of allowed deviation of the measured capacitance from the rated value is called the capacitance tolerance. Electrolytic capacitors are available in different tolerance series, whose values are specified in the [[Preferred number#E series|E series]] specified in IEC 60063. For abbreviated marking in tight spaces, a letter code for each tolerance is specified in IEC 60062.\n* rated capacitance, series E3, tolerance \u00b120%, letter code \"M\"\n* rated capacitance, series E6, tolerance \u00b120%, letter code \"M\"\n* rated capacitance, series E12, tolerance \u00b110%, letter code \"K\"\n\nThe required capacitance tolerance is determined by the particular application. Electrolytic capacitors, which are often used for [[Electronic filter|filtering]] and [[Decoupling capacitor|bypassing]], do not have the need for narrow tolerances because they are mostly not used for accurate frequency applications like in [[oscillator]]s.\n\n===Rated and category voltage===\n[[File:Rated-Category.png|thumb|right|Relation between rated and category voltage and rated and category temperature]]\n\nReferring to the IEC/EN 60384-1 standard, the allowed operating voltage for electrolytic capacitors is called the \"rated voltage U<sub>R</sub>\" or \"nominal voltage U<sub>N</sub>\". The rated voltage U<sub>R</sub> is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously at any temperature within the rated temperature range T<sub>R</sub>.\n\nThe voltage proof of electrolytic capacitors decreases with increasing temperature. For some applications it is important to use a higher temperature range. Lowering the voltage applied at a higher temperature maintains safety margins. For some capacitor types therefore the IEC standard specifies a \"temperature derated voltage\" for a higher temperature, the \"category voltage U<sub>C</sub>\". The category voltage is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously to a capacitor at any temperature within the category temperature range T<sub>C</sub>. The relation between both voltages and temperatures is given in the picture at right.\n\nApplying a higher voltage than specified may destroy electrolytic capacitors.\n\nApplying a lower voltage may have a positive influence on electrolytic capacitors. For aluminum electrolytic capacitors a lower applied voltage can in some cases extend the lifetime.<ref name=Voltage /> For tantalum electrolytic capacitors lowering the voltage applied increases the reliability and reduces the expected failure rate.<ref name=AVX-Reliability>Ch. Reynolds, AVX, Technical Information, Reliability Management of Tantalum Capacitors, [http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/rmtant.pdf PDF]</ref>\nI\n\n===Surge Voltage ===\nThe surge voltage indicates the maximum peak voltage value that may be applied to electrolytic capacitors during their application for a limited number of cycles.<ref name=Voltage />\nThe surge voltage is standardized in IEC/EN 60384-1. For aluminum electrolytic capacitors with a rated voltage of up to 315&nbsp;V, the surge voltage is 1.15 times the rated voltage, and for capacitors with a rated voltage exceeding 315&nbsp;V, the surge voltage is 1.10 times the rated voltage.\n\nFor tantalum electrolytic capacitors the surge voltage can be 1.3 times the rated voltage, rounded off to the nearest volt. The surge voltage applied to tantalum capacitors may influence the capacitor's failure rate.<ref name=surge>[http://www.avxtantalum.com/pdf/SURGTANT.PDF J.

This ability depends on rated voltage and component size. Low energy transient voltages lead to a voltage limitation similar to a [[zener diode]].<ref>Imam, A.M., Condition Monitoring of Electrolytic Capacitors for Power Electronics Applications, Dissertation, Georgia Institute of Technology (2007) [https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/14472/imam_afroz_m_200705_phd.pdf smartech.gatech.edu]</ref> An unambiguous and general specification of tolerable transients or peak voltages is not possible. In every case transients arise, the application has to be approved very carefully.\n\nElectrolytic capacitors with solid manganese oxide or polymer electrolyte, and aluminum as well as tantalum electrolytic capacitors can not withstand transients or peak voltages higher than surge voltage. Transients for this type of e-caps may destroy the components.<ref name=surge /><ref name=Teverovsky />\n\n===Reverse voltage===\n[[File:Exploded Electrolytic Capacitor.jpg|thumb|An exploded aluminum electrolytic capacitor on a PCB]]\nStandard electrolytic capacitors, and aluminum as well as tantalum and niobium electrolytic capacitors are polarized and generally require the anode electrode voltage to be positive relative to the cathode voltage.\n\nNevertheless, electrolytic capacitors can withstand for short instants a reverse voltage for a limited number of cycles. In detail, aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte can withstand a reverse voltage of about 1&nbsp;V to 1.5&nbsp;V. This reverse voltage should never be used to determine the maximum reverse voltage under which a capacitor can be used permanently.<ref>Nichicon. \"General Description of Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors\" [http://www.nichicon-us.com/english/products/pdf/aluminum.pdf PDF] section \"2-3-2 Reverse Voltage\".</ref><ref>Rubycon.

The most common guidelines for tantalum reverse voltage are:\n*10&nbsp;% of rated voltage to a maximum of 1&nbsp;V at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C,\n*3&nbsp;% of rated voltage to a maximum of 0.5&nbsp;V at 85&nbsp;\u00b0C,\n*1&nbsp;% of rated voltage to a maximum of 0.1&nbsp;V at 125&nbsp;\u00b0C.\nThese guidelines apply for short excursion and should never be used to determine the maximum reverse voltage under which a capacitor can be used permanently.<ref>I.

In these, the capacitors have two anode foils with full-thickness oxide layers connected in reverse polarity. On the alternate halves of the AC cycles, one of the oxides on the foil acts as a blocking dielectric, preventing reverse current from damaging the electrolyte of the other one. But these bipolar electrolytic capacitors are not adaptable for main AC applications instead of power capacitors with metallized polymer film or paper dielectric.\n\n===Impedance===\n[[File:Kondensator Zeigerdiagramm-1-.svg|thumb|right|140px|Simplified series-equivalent circuit of a capacitor for higher frequencies (above); vector diagram with electrical reactances ''X<sub>ESL</sub>'' and ''X<sub>C</sub>'' and resistance ''ESR'' and for illustration the impedance ''Z'' and dissipation factor ''tan \u03b4'']]\n\nIn general, a capacitor is seen as a storage component for electric energy. But this is only one capacitor function. A capacitor can also act as an [[Alternating current|AC]] [[resistor]]. Especially aluminum electrolytic capacitors in many applications are used as [[decoupling capacitor]]s to filter or bypass undesired biased AC frequencies to the ground or for [[capacitive coupling]] of audio AC signals. Then the dielectric is used only for blocking DC. For such applications the AC [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], is as important as the capacitance value.\n\n[[File:Kondensator-Impedanzverl\u00e4ufe-Wiki-1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Typical impedance curves for different capacitance values over frequency. The higher the capacitance the lower the resonance frequency.]]\n\nThe impedance ''Z'' is the vector sum of [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]]; it describes the phase difference and the ratio of amplitudes between sinusoidally varying voltage and sinusoidally varying current at a given frequency. In this sense impedance is a measure of the ability of the capacitor to pass alternating currents and can be used like Ohm's law.\n: <math>Z = \\frac{\\hat u}{\\hat \\imath} = \\frac{U_\\mathrm{eff}}{I_\\mathrm{eff}}.</math>\n\nIn other words, the impedance is a frequency-dependent AC resistance and possesses both magnitude and [[Phasor|phase]] at a particular frequency.\n\nIn data sheets of electrolytic capacitors only the impedance magnitude ''|Z|'' is specified, and simply written as ''\"Z\".'' Regarding the IEC/EN 60384-1 standard, the impedance values of electrolytic capacitors are measured and specified at 10&nbsp;kHz or 100&nbsp;kHz depending on the capacitance and voltage of the capacitor.\n\nBesides measuring, the impedance can be calculated using the idealized components of a capacitor's series-equivalent circuit, including an ideal capacitor ''C'', a resistor ''ESR'', and an inductance ''ESL''. In this case the impedance at the angular frequency ''\u03c9'' is given by the geometric (complex) addition of ''ESR'', by a capacitive reactance ''X<sub>C</sub>''\n\n: <math> X_C= -\\frac{1}{\\omega C}</math>\n\nand by an inductive reactance ''X<sub>L</sub>'' ([[Inductance]])\n\n<math> X_L=\\omega L_{\\mathrm{ESL}}</math>.\n\nThen ''Z'' is given by\n\n: <math>Z=\\sqrt{{ESR}^2 + (X_\\mathrm{C} + (-X_\\mathrm{L}))^2}</math>.\n\nIn the special case of [[resonance]], in which the both reactive resistances ''X<sub>C</sub>'' and ''X<sub>L</sub>'' have the same value (''X<sub>C</sub>=X<sub>L</sub>''), then the impedance will only be determined by ''ESR''. With frequencies above the resonance the impedance increases again due to the ''ESL'' of the capacitor. The capacitor becomes an inductance.\n\n===ESR and dissipation factor tan \u03b4===\n<center>\n<gallery caption=\"Typical impedance and ESR curves as a function of frequency and temperature\" class=\"centered\" mode=packed heights=150px>\nFile:Elko-Impedanzverlauf-mit-ESR.svg|Typical impedance and ESR as a function of frequency\nFile:E-cap-impedance_versus_temperature.jpg|Typical impedance as a function of temperature\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\nThe [[equivalent series resistance]] (''ESR'') summarizes all resistive losses of the capacitor. These are the terminal resistances, the contact resistance of the electrode contact, the line resistance of the electrodes, the electrolyte resistance, and the [[dielectric losses]] in the dielectric oxide layer.<ref>A.

Related to the capacitorm ''ESR'' accounts for internal heat generation if a ripple current flows over the capacitor. This internal heat reduces the lifetime of non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors or influences the reliability of solid tantalum electrolytic capacitors.\n\nFor electrolytic capacitors, for historical reasons the [[dissipation factor]] ''tan \u03b4'' will sometimes be specified in the relevant data sheets, instead of the ''ESR''. The dissipation factor is determined by the tangent of the phase angle between the capacitive reactance ''X<sub>C</sub>'' minus the inductive reactance ''X<sub>L</sub>'' and the ''ESR''. If the inductance ''ESL'' is small, the dissipation factor can be approximated as:\n\n: <math>\\tan \\delta = \\mbox{ESR} \\cdot \\omega C</math>\n\nThe dissipation factor is used for capacitors with very low losses in frequency-determining circuits where the reciprocal value of the dissipation factor is called the [[Q factor|quality factor]] (Q), which represents a resonator's [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]].\n\n===Ripple current===\n[[File:rippelstrom mit Schaltplan.png|thumb|250px|The superimposed (DC biased) AC ripple current flow across the smoothing capacitor C1 of a power supply causes internal heat generation corresponding to the capacitor's ''ESR'']]\n\nA \"ripple current\" is the [[Root mean square|RMS]] value of a superimposed AC current of any frequency and any waveform of the current curve for continuous operation within the specified temperature range. It arises mainly in power supplies (including [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]]) after rectifying an AC voltage and flows as charge and discharge current through the decoupling or smoothing capacitor.\n\nRipple currents generates heat inside the capacitor body. This dissipation power loss ''P<sub>L</sub>'' is caused by ''ESR'' and is the squared value of the effective (RMS) ripple current ''I<sub>R</sub>''.\n\n: <math>P_{L} = I_R^2 \\cdot ESR</math>\n\nThis internally generated heat, additional to the ambient temperature and possibly other external heat sources, leads to a capacitor body temperature having a temperature difference of ''\u0394 T'' against the ambient. This heat has to be distributed as thermal losses ''P<sub>th</sub>'' over the capacitor's surface ''A'' and the thermal resistance ''\u03b2'' to the ambient.\n\n: <math> P_{th} = \\Delta T \\cdot A \\cdot \\beta</math>\n\nThe internally generated heat has to be distributed to the ambient by [[thermal radiation]], [[convection]], and [[thermal conduction]].

This property is a result of the limited ion movability in the liquid electrolyte, which slows down the voltage ramp across the dielectric, and of the capacitor's ESR. Only the frequency of peaks integrated over time must not exceed the maximal specified ripple current.\n\nSolid tantalum electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte or polymer electrolyte are damaged by peak or pulse currents.<ref name=surge /><ref name=Teverovsky /> Solid Tantalum capacitors which are exposed to surge, peak or pulse currents, for example, in highly inductive circuits, should be used with a voltage derating. If possible the voltage profile should be a ramp turn-on, as this reduces the peak current experienced by the capacitor.\n\n===Leakage current===\n[[File:Leakage current curves.png|thumb|right|The general leakage current behavior of electrolytic capacitors depends on the kind of electrolyte]]\nFor electrolytic capacitors, [[Leakage (electronics)|DC leakage current]] (DCL) is a special characteristic that other conventional capacitors do not have. This current is represented by the resistor R<sub>leak</sub> in parallel with the capacitor in the series-equivalent circuit of electrolytic capacitors.\n\nThe reasons for leakage current are different between electrolytic capacitors with non-solid and with solid electrolyte or more common for \"wet\" aluminum and for \"solid\" tantalum electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte as well as for electrolytic capacitors with polymer electrolytes. For non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors the leakage current includes all weakened imperfections of the dielectric caused by unwanted chemical processes taking place during the time without applied voltage (storage time) between operating cycles. These unwanted chemical processes depend on the kind of electrolyte. Electrolytes with water content or water based electrolytes are more aggressive to the aluminum oxide layer than are electrolytes based on organic liquids. This is why different electrolytic capacitor series specify different storage time without reforming instructions.<ref>Vishay, Aluminium capacitors, Introduction, Revision: 10-Sep-13 1 Document Number: 28356, Chapter Storage, page 7 [http://www.vishay.com/docs/28356/alucapsintroduction.pdf vishay.com]</ref>\n\nApplying a positive voltage to a \"wet\" capacitor causes a reforming (self-healing) process which repairs all weakened dielectric layers, and the leakage current remain at a low level.<ref name=Baur>Ch. Baur, N. Will, Epcos, Long-term stability of aluminum electrolytic capacitors [http://www.epcos.com/epcos-en/373562/tech-library/articles/applications---cases/applications---cases/built-to-last/172020 Built to last]</ref>\n\nAlthough the leakage current of non-solid e-caps is higher than current flow over insulation resistance in ceramic or film capacitors, the self-discharge of modern non-solid electrolytic capacitors with organic electrolytes takes several weeks.\n\nThe main causes of DCL for solid tantalum capacitors include electrical breakdown of the dielectric, conductive paths due to impurities or poor anodization, bypassing of dielectric due to excess manganese dioxide, to moisture paths, or to cathode conductors (carbon, silver).<ref>[http://www.interstatemarketing.com/Papers/TechArticles/Tant-Niobium/leakage.pdf R.W. Franklin, AVX, AN EXPLORATION OF LEAKAGE CURRENT]</ref> This \"normal\" leakage current in solid electrolyte capacitors cannot be reduced by \"healing\", because under normal conditions solid electrolytes cannot provide oxygen for forming processes. This statement should not be confused with the self-healing process during field crystallization, see below, Reliability (Failure rate).\n\nThe specification of the leakage current in data sheets is often given by multiplication of the rated capacitance value ''C<sub>R</sub>'' with the value of the rated voltage ''U<sub>R</sub>'' together with an addendum figure, measured after a measuring time of 2 or 5 minutes, for example:\n\n:<math>I_\\mathrm{Leak} = 0{,}01\\,\\mathrm{{A}\\over{ V \\cdot F}} \\cdot U_\\mathrm R \\cdot C_\\mathrm R + 3\\,\\mathrm{\\mu A}</math>\n\nThe leakage current value depends on the voltage applied, on the temperature of the capacitor, and on measuring time. Leakage current in solid MnO<sub>2</sub> tantalum electrolytic capacitors generally drops very much faster than for non-solid electrolytic capacitors but remain at the level reached.\n\n===Dielectric absorption (soakage)===\n{{main|Dielectric absorption}}\n\nDielectric absorption occurs when a capacitor that has remained charged for a long time discharges only incompletely when briefly discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would reach zero volts after discharge, real capacitors develop a small voltage from time-delayed dipole discharging, a phenomenon that is also called [[dielectric relaxation]], \"soakage\" or \"battery action\".\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable centered\"\n|+ Values of dielectric absorption for some often used capacitors\n|- style=\"background:#abcdef;\"\n!

The time of random failures is the time of constant failure rate and corresponds with the lifetime of non-solid e-caps.]]\n\nThe [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] of a component is a property that indicates how reliably this component performs its function in a time interval. It is subject to a [[stochastic process]] and can be described qualitatively and quantitatively; it is not directly measurable. The reliability of electrolytic capacitors is empirically determined by identifying the [[failure rate]] in production accompanying [[endurance test]]s, see [[Reliability engineering]].\n\nReliability normally is shown as a [[bathtub curve]] and is divided into three areas: early failures or infant mortality failures, constant random failures and wear out failures. Failures totalized in a failure rate are short circuit, open circuit, and degradation failures (exceeding electrical parameters).\n\nThe [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] prediction is generally expressed in a [[failure rate]] \u03bb, abbreviated '''FIT''' ('''F'''ailures '''I'''n '''T'''ime]. This is the number of failures that can be expected in one billion (10<sup>9</sup>) component-hours of operation (e.g., 1000 components for 1&nbsp;million hours, or 1&nbsp; million components for 1000 hours which is 1&nbsp;ppm/1000 hours) at fixed working conditions during the period of constant random failures. This failure rate model implicitly assumes the idea of \"random failure\". Individual components fail at random times but at a predictable rate.\n\nBillions of tested capacitor unit-hours would be needed to establish failure rates in the very low level range which are required today to ensure the production of large quantities of components without failures. This requires about a million units over a long time period, which means a large staff and considerable financing.<ref>[http://www.niccomp.com/Products/smt/NTCRel-FR71399.pdf NIC, Failure Rate Estimation]</ref> The tested failure rates are often complemented with figures resulting from feedback from the field from big users concerning failed components (field failure rate), which mostly results in a lower failure rate than tested.\n\nThe reciprocal value of FIT is [[Mean Time Between Failures|MTBF]] ('''M'''ean '''T'''ime '''B'''etween '''F'''ailures).\n\nThe standard operating conditions for the failure rate FIT are 40&nbsp;\u00b0C and 0.5&nbsp;U<sub>R</sub>. For other conditions of applied voltage, current load, temperature, capacitance value, circuit resistance (for tantalum capacitors), mechanical influences and humidity, the FIT figure can be recalculated with acceleration factors standardized for industrial<ref>IEC/EN 61709, Electric components.

The higher the temperature and applied voltage the higher the failure rate, for example.\n\nThe most often cited source for recalculation of failure rate is the MIL-HDBK-217F, the \u201cbible\u201d of failure rate calculations for electronic components.

Parler, Cornell Dubilier, Reliability of CDE Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors ([http://www.cde.com/tech/reliability.pdf PDF])</ref>\n\nIt is good to know that for tantalum capacitors the failure rate is often specified in essence at 85&nbsp;\u00b0C and rated voltage U<sub>R</sub> as reference conditions and expressed as percent failed components per thousand hours (n&nbsp;%/1000&nbsp;h). That is, \u201cn\u201d number of failed components per 10<sup>5</sup> hours, or in FIT the ten-thousand-fold value per 10<sup>9</sup> hours.\n\nIt should be noted that industrially produced tantalum capacitors nowadays are very reliable components. Continuous improvement in tantalum powder and capacitor technologies have resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of impurities which formerly caused most field crystallization failures. Commercially available industrially produced tantalum capacitors now have reached as standard products the high MIL standard \"C\" level, which is 0.01%/1000 h at 85&nbsp;\u00b0C and U<sub>R</sub> or 1 failure per 10<sup>7</sup> hours at 85&nbsp;\u00b0C and U<sub>R</sub>.<ref name=FC-Study>T.Zednicek, AVX, A Study of Field Crystallization in Tantalum Capacitors and its effect on DCL and Reliability, [http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/FieldCrystallization.pdf]</ref> Recalculated in FIT with the acceleration factors coming from MIL HDKB 217F at 40&nbsp;\u00b0C and 0.5&nbsp;, U<sub>R</sub> is the failure rate. For a 100&nbsp;\u00b5F/25&nbsp;V tantalum chip capacitor used with a series resistance of 0.1&nbsp;\u03a9 the failure rate is 0.02 FIT.\n\nAluminum electrolytic capacitors do not use a specification in \"%&nbsp;per 1000&nbsp;h at 85&nbsp;\u00b0C and U<sub>R</sub>\". They use the FIT specification with 40&nbsp;\u00b0C and 0.5&nbsp;U<sub>R</sub> as reference conditions. Also for aluminum electrolytic capacitors it should be noted that they are very reliable components.

Albertsen, Jianghai Europe, Reliability of Electrolytic Capacitors, [http://jianghai-europe.com/wp-content/uploads/2-Jianghai-Europe-E-Cap-Reliability-AAL-2012-10-30.pdf PDF]</ref> and for high voltage types (>160 \u2026550&nbsp;V) FIT rates in the range of 20 to 200 FIT.<ref name=Parler /> Field failure rates for aluminum e-caps are in the range of 0.5 to 20&nbsp;FIT.<ref name=Parler /><ref name=Al-reliability /><ref>Hitachi aic-europe, Explanations to the useful life, [http://www.aic-europe.com/images/stories/produkte/screw/p104_explanations_lifetime.pdf PDF]</ref>\n\nThe published figures show that both capacitor types, tantalum and aluminum, are reliable components, comparable with other electronic components and achieving safe operation for decades under normal conditions. But a great difference exists in the case of [[Bathtub curve|wear-out failures]]. Tantalum capacitors with solid electrolyte have no wear-out mechanism so that the constant failure rate is least, up to the point when all capacitors fail. Electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte, however, have a limited time of constant random failures up to that point when the wear-out failures start. This time of the constant random failure rate corresponds with the [[Service life|lifetime]] or [[service life]] of \u201cwet\u201d aluminum electrolytic capacitors.\n\n===Lifetime===\n[[File:Lebensdauer-Testergebnisse-english.png|thumb|400px|The electrical values of aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte change over time due to evaporation of electrolyte. Reaching the specified limits of the electrical parameters, the time of the constant failure rate ends and it is the end of the capacitor's lifetime. The graph show this behavior in a 2000&nbsp;h endurance test at 105&nbsp;\u00b0C.]]\n\nThe [[Service life|lifetime]], [[service life]], load life or useful life of electrolytic capacitors is a special characteristic of non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors, whose liquid electrolyte can evaporate over time. Lowering the electrolyte level influences the electrical parameters of the capacitors. The capacitance decreases and the impedance and ESR increase with decreasing amounts of electrolyte. This very slow electrolyte drying-out depends on the temperature, the applied ripple current load, and the applied voltage. The lower these parameters compared with their maximum values the longer the capacitor's \u201clife\u201d. The \u201cend of life\u201d point is defined by the appearance of wear-out failures or degradation failures when either capacitance, impedance, ESR or leakage current exceed their specified change limits.\n\nThe lifetime is a specification of a collection of tested capacitors and delivers an expectation of the behavior of similar types. This lifetime definition corresponds with the time of the constant random failure rate in the bathtub curve.\n\nBut even after exceeding the specified limits and the capacitors having reached their \u201cend of life\u201d the electronic circuit is not in immediate danger; only the functionality of the capacitors is reduced. With today's high levels of purity in the manufacture of electrolytic capacitors it is not to be expected that short circuits occur after the end-of-life-point with progressive evaporation combined with parameter degradation.\n\nThe lifetime of non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors is specified in terms of \u201chours per temperature\", like \"2,000h/105&nbsp;\u00b0C\". With this specification the lifetime at operational conditions can be estimated by special formulas or graphs specified in the data sheets of serious manufacturers. They use different ways for specification, some give special formulas,<ref name=NCCTN>NCC, Technical Note Judicious Use of Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors [http://www.chemi-con.co.jp/e/catalog/pdf/al-e/al-sepa-e/001-guide/al-technote-e-140701.pdf PDF]</ref><ref>Rubycon, LIFE OF ALUMINUM ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITORS, S. 9 ([http://www.rubycon.co.jp/en/products/alumi/pdf/Life.pdf PDF])</ref> others specify their e-caps lifetime calculation with graphs that consider the influence of applied voltage.<ref name=Al-reliability /><ref name=Jianglife>A.

It characterizes the change of thermic reaction speed. For every 10&nbsp;\u00b0C lower temperature the evaporation is reduced by half. That means for every 10&nbsp;\u00b0C lower temperature the lifetime of capacitors doubles. If a lifetime specification of an electrolytic capacitor is, for example, 2000&nbsp; h/105&nbsp;\u00b0C, the capacitor's lifetime at 45&nbsp;\u00b0C can be \u201dcalculated\u201d as 128,000 hours\u2014that is roughly 15 years\u2014by using the 10-degrees-rule.\n\nHowever, solid polymer electrolytic capacitors, aluminum as well as tantalum and niobium electrolytic capacitors also have a lifetime specification. The polymer electrolyte has a small deterioration of conductivity caused by a thermal degradation mechanism in the conductive polymer. The electrical conductivity decreases as a function of time, in agreement with a granular metal type structure, in which aging is due to the shrinking of the conductive polymer grains.<ref>E.

Also, tantalum capacitors with non-solid electrolyte, the \"wet tantalums\", do not have a lifetime specification because they are hermetically sealed and evaporation of electrolyte is minimized.\n\nElectrolytic capacitors with solid electrolyte do not have wear-out failures so they do not have a lifetime specification in the sense of non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors.\n\n===Failure modes, self-healing mechanism and application rules===\nThe many different types of electrolytic capacitors show differences in electrical long-term behavior, their inherent failure modes, and their self-healing mechanism.

However, a particular problem with non-solid aluminum models may occur after storage or unpowered periods. Chemical processes (corrosion) can weaken the oxide layer, which may lead to a higher leakage current. Most modern electrolytic systems are chemically inert and without corrosion problems, even after storage times of two years or longer. Non-solid electrolytic capacitors using organic solvents like [[gamma-Butyrolactone|GBL]] as electrolyte do not have problems with high leakage current after longer storage times.<ref name=\"Baur\" /> They can be stored for up to 10 years without problems<ref name=\"VishayIAC\" />\n\nStorage times can be tested using accelerated shelf-life testing, which requires storage without applied voltage at the upper category temperature for a certain period, usually 1000 hours. This shelf life test is a good indicator for chemical stability and of the oxide layer, because all chemical reactions are accelerated by higher temperatures. Nearly all commercial series of non-solid electrolytics fulfill the 1000 hour shelf life test. However, many series are specified only for two years of storage. This also ensures the continuing solderability of the terminals.\n\nFor antique radio equipment or for electrolytics built in the 1970s or earlier, \"pre-conditioning\" may be appropriate. For this purpose, the rated voltage is applied to the capacitor via a series resistance of approximately 1&nbsp;k\u03a9 for one hour. Applying a voltage via a safety resistor repairs the oxide layer by self-healing. Capacitors that fail leakage current requirements after preconditioning, may have experienced mechanical damage.<ref name=\"EpcosGTI\" />\n\nElectrolytic capacitors with solid electrolytes don\u2019t have precondition requirements.\n\n==Additional information==\n\n===Capacitor symbols===\n'''Electrolytic capacitor symbols'''\n{|\n|-\n| [[Image:Polarized capacitor symbol.png]]|| [[Image:Polarized capacitor symbol 2.png]]|| [[Image:Polarized capacitor symbol 3.png]] ||[[Image:Capacitor-symbol-bipolar-El-Cap.png]]\n|-\n| Electrolytic <br/> capacitor || Electrolytic<br/> capacitor||Electrolytic<br/> capacitor ||Bipolar <br /> electrolytic <br /> capacitor\n|}\n\n===Parallel connection===\nSmaller or low voltage electrolytic capacitors may be connected in parallel without any safety correction action. Large size capacitors, especially large sizes and high voltage types should be individually guarded against sudden energy charge of the whole capacitor bank due to a failed specimen.\n\n===Series connection===\nSome applications like [[AC/AC converter]]s with DC-link for frequency controls in [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase grids]] need the higher voltages aluminum electrolytic capacitors usually offer. For such applications electrolytic capacitors can be connected in series for increased voltage-withstanding capability. During charging, the voltage across each of the capacitors connected in series is proportional to the inverse of the individual capacitor\u2019s leakage current. Since every capacitor differs a little bit in individual leakage current, the capacitors with a higher leakage current will get less voltage. The voltage balance over the series-connected capacitors is not symmetrical. Passive or active voltage balance has to be provided in order to stabilize the voltage over each individual capacitor.<ref name=VishayIAC>Vishay BCcomponents, Introduction Aluminum Capacitors, Revision: 10-Sep-13 1 Document Number: 28356, [http://www.vishay.com/docs/28356/alucapsintroduction.pdf PDF]</ref><ref name=EpcosGTI>Epcos, Aluminum electrolytic capacitors, General technical informations [http://www.epcos.de/blob/185386/download/4/pdf-generaltechnicalinformation.pdf PDF]</ref>\n\n===Polarity marking===\n<center>\n<gallery caption=\" Polarity marking for non-solid and solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors\" class=\"centered\" mode=packed heights=150px>\nFile:Polarity-wet-Al-Elcaps.jpg| Electrolytic capacitors with '''non-solid''' electrolyte have a polarity marking at the cathode ('''minus''') side\nFile:Polarity-rectangular-chips.jpg| Electrolytic capacitors with '''solid''' electrolyte have a polarity marking at the anode ('''plus''') side, except for cylindrical leaded (single-ended) and SMD (V-chip) [[Polymer capacitor#Polarity marking|polymer capacitors]]<ref>http://capacitor.web.fc2.com/solidcapacitor.html</ref>\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n'''Polarity marking for polymer electrolytic capacitors'''\n\n{|\n|-\n|[[File:Polymer-Quader-Polarit\u00e4t.jpg|center|100px]]|| [[File:V-Chip.jpg|center|100px]]\n|-\n|Rectangular polymer capacitors,<br />tantalum as well as aluminum,<br /> have a polarity marking<br /> at the anode ('''plus''') side||\nCylindrical polymer capacitors <br />have a polarity marking<br /> at the cathode ('''minus''') side\n|}\n\n===Imprinted markings===\nElectrolytic capacitors, like most other electronic components and if enough space is available, have imprinted markings to indicate manufacturer, type, electrical and thermal characteristics, and date of manufacture. If they are large enough the capacitor is marked with\n* manufacturer's name or trademark;\n* manufacturer's type designation;\n* polarity of the terminations (for polarized capacitors)\n* rated capacitance;\n* tolerance on rated capacitance\n* rated voltage and nature of supply (AC or DC)\n* climatic category or rated temperature;\n* year and month (or week) of manufacture;\n* certification marks of safety standards (for safety EMI/RFI suppression capacitors)\n\nPolarized capacitors have polarity markings, usually a \"\u2212\" (minus) sign on the side of the negative electrode for electrolytic capacitors or a stripe or a \"+\" (plus) sign. Also, the negative lead for leaded \"wet\" e-caps is usually shorter.\n\nSmaller capacitors use a shorthand notation. The most commonly used format is: XYZ J/K/M \u201cV\u201d, where XYZ represents the capacitance (calculated as XY \u00d7 10<sup>Z</sup> pF), the letters K or M indicate the tolerance (\u00b110% and \u00b120% respectively) and \u201cV\u201d represents the working voltage.\n\nExamples:\n\n* 105K 330V implies a capacitance of 10 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> pF = 1 \u00b5F (K = \u00b110%) with a rated voltage of 330 V.\n* 476M 100V implies a capacitance of 47 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> pF = 47 \u00b5F (M = \u00b120%) with a rated voltage of 100 V.\n\nCapacitance, tolerance and date of manufacture can be indicated with a short code specified in IEC/EN 60062. Examples of short-marking of the rated capacitance (microfarads): \u00b547 = 0,47 \u00b5F, 4\u00b57 = 4,7 \u00b5F, 47\u00b5 = 47 \u00b5F\n\nThe date of manufacture is often printed in accordance with international standards.\n\n* Version 1: coding with year/week numeral code, \"1208\" is \"2012, week number 8\".\n* Version 2: coding with year code/month code. The year codes are: \"R\" = 2003, \"S\"= 2004, \"T\" = 2005, \"U\" = 2006, \"V\" = 2007, \"W\" = 2008, \"X\" = 2009, \"A\" = 2010, \"B\" = 2011, \"C\" = 2012, \"D\" = 2013, \u201cE\u201d = 2014 etc. Month codes are: \"1\" to \"9\" = Jan. to Sept., \"O\" = October, \"N\" = November, \"D\" = December. \"X5\" is then \"2009, May\"\n\nFor very small capacitors no marking is possible. Here only the traceability of the manufacturers can ensure the identification of a type.\n\n===Standardization===\nThe standardization for all [[electrical]], [[electronics|electronic]] components and related technologies follows the rules given by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC),<ref>[http://www.iec.ch/ IEC Homepage]</ref> a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]], non-governmental international [[standards organization]].<ref>[http://webstore.iec.ch/?ref=menu IEC Webstore]</ref><ref>[http://www.beuth.de/de/ IEC/EN/DIN Standards, Beuth-Verlag]</ref>\n\nThe definition of the characteristics and the procedure of the test methods for [[capacitor]]s for use in electronic equipment are set out in the '''Generic specification''':\n\n* IEC/EN 60384-1 - Fixed capacitors for use in electronic equipment\n\nThe tests and requirements to be met by aluminum and tantalum electrolytic capacitors for use in electronic equipment for approval as standardized types are set out in the following '''sectional specifications''':\n\n* IEC/EN 60384-3\u2014''Surface mount fixed tantalum electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide solid electrolyte''\n* IEC/EN 60384-4\u2014''Aluminium electrolytic capacitors with solid (MnO<sub>2</sub>) and non-solid electrolyte''\n* IEC/EN 60384-15\u2014''Fixed tantalum capacitors with non-solid and solid electrolyte''\n* IEC/EN 60384-18\u2014''Fixed aluminium electrolytic surface mount capacitors with solid (MnO<sub>2</sub>) and non-solid electrolyte''\n* IEC/EN 60384-24\u2014''Surface mount fixed tantalum electrolytic capacitors with conductive polymer solid electrolyte''\n* IEC/EN 60384-25\u2014''Surface mount fixed aluminium electrolytic capacitors with conductive polymer solid electrolyte''\n* IEC/EN 60384-26\u2014''Fixed aluminium electrolytic capacitors with conductive polymer solid electrolyte''\n\n===Market===\nThe market for electrolytic capacitors in 2008 was roughly 30% of the total market in value\n* Aluminum electrolytic capacitors\u2014US$3.9 billion (22%);\n* Tantalum electrolytic capacitors\u2014US$2.2 billion (12%);\nIn number of pieces, these capacitors cover about 10% of the total capacitor market, or about 100 to 120 billion pieces.<ref>Electronic Capacitors, SIC 3675, NAICS 334414: Electronic Capacitor Manufacturing, Industry report: [http://business.highbeam.com/industry-reports/equipment/electronic-capacitors]</ref>\n\n===Manufacturers and products===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ ''Worldwide operating manufacturers and their electrolytic capacitor product program''\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Manufacturer\n! colspan=\"4\" | Aluminum<br /> electrolytic capacitors\n! colspan=\"3\" | Tantalum <br /> electrolytic capacitors\n! colspan=\"1\" | Niobium <br /> electrolytic <br />capacitors\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!
