Propellant tanks are pressurized to supply fuel and oxidizer to the engine, eliminating the need for [[turbopump]]s.]]\n\nThe '''pressure-fed engine''' is a class of [[rocket engine]] designs. A separate gas supply, usually [[helium]], pressurizes the propellant tanks to force fuel and oxidizer to the combustion chamber. To maintain adequate flow, the tank pressures must exceed the combustion chamber pressure.\n\nPressure fed engines have simple plumbing and lack complex and often unreliable [[turbopump]]s. A typical startup procedure begins with opening a valve, often a one-shot pyrotechnic device, to allow the pressurizing gas to flow through check valves into the propellant tanks. Then the propellant valves in the engine itself are opened. If the fuel and oxidizer are [[hypergolic]], they burn on contact; non-hypergolic fuels require an igniter. Multiple burns can be conducted by merely opening and closing the propellant valves as needed, if the pressurization system also has activating valves. They can be operated electrically, or by gas pressure controlled by smaller electrically operated valves.\n\nCare must be taken, especially during long burns, to avoid excessive cooling of the pressurizing gas due to [[Adiabatic_process#Adiabatic_free_expansion_of_a_gas|adiabatic expansion]]. Cold helium won't liquify, but it could freeze a propellant, decrease tank pressures, or damage components not designed for low temperatures. The [[Apollo Lunar Module]] [[Descent Propulsion System]] was unusual in storing its helium in a [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] but very cold state. It was warmed as it was withdrawn through a [[heat exchanger]] from the ambient temperature fuel.<ref name=LMDE />\n\nSpacecraft [[attitude control]] and [[orbital maneuver]]ing thrusters are almost universally pressure-fed designs.<ref name=London>{{cite book |author=JOHN R.

High pressure propellant tanks require thicker walls and stronger alloys which make the vehicle tanks heavier, thereby reducing performance and payload capacity.  The lower stages of [[launch vehicle]]s often use either [[Solid-fuel rocket|solid fuel]] or [[Pump-fed engine|pump-fed]] liquid fuel engines instead, where high pressure ratio nozzles are considered desirable.<ref name=London />\n\nOther vehicles or companies using pressure-fed engine:\n*[[Firefly Space Systems]]\n*[[OTRAG (rocket)]]\n*[[Quad (rocket)]] of [[Armadillo Aerospace]]\n*[[XCOR EZ-Rocket]] of [[XCOR Aerospace]]\n*[[Masten Space Systems]]\n*[[Aquarius Launch Vehicle]]\n*NASA's [[Project Morpheus]] prototype lander\n*[[NASA Mighty Eagle]] mini lunar lander\n*[[Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Actividades Espaciales|CONAE]]'s [[Tronador (rocket)|Tronador II]] upper stage{{cn|date=September 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Gas-generator cycle (rocket)|Gas-generator cycle]]\n*[[Combustion tap-off cycle]]\n*[[Expander cycle (rocket)|Expander cycle]]\n*[[Staged combustion cycle (rocket)|Staged combustion cycle]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/winter2004/03_sidebar3.html Rocket power cycles]\n\n{{spacecraft propulsion}}\n{{Thermodynamic cycles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pressure-Fed Cycle (Rocket)}}\n[[Category:Rocket propulsion]]\n[[Category:Rocket engines]]\n[[Category:Rocket engines by cycle| ]]\n[[Category:Thermodynamics]]\n[[Category:Pressure-fed rockets| ]]"}]}}}}
