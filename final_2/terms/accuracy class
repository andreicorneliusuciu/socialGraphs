Classes are denoted by either a letter or percentage.  For example, Class B is a temperature [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]] from IEC-751 that requires accuracy of \u00b1 0.15 degrees [[Celsius]]. Class 0.5 is an ANSI C12.20 accuracy class for electric meters with absolute accuracy better than \u00b1 0.5% of the nominal full scale reading.\n\nTypically, a class specifies accuracy at a number of points, with the absolute accuracy at lower values being better than the nominal \"percentage of full scale\" accuracy.\n\nAccuracy classes such as IEC's 0.15s are a 'special' high accuracy class.\n\n Calculation for accuracy of class 1 meter:\n 1600 impulse/KWh and \n considering, P.F= 1 and LOAD = 100w\n Revolution time, \n '''R'''t = (3600\u00d7'''K'''h\u00d71)/Load(w) ['''K'''h = 1000/(impulse/Kwh=1600)]\n '''R'''t = (3600\u00d70.625\u00d71)/100\n '''R'''t = 22.5sec [Standard]\n\n %of error = ('''F'''t-'''R'''t)/'''R'''t\n\nThe positive or negative result indicates whether the meter is fast or slow. If the result is positive then the meter is fast, while negative means the meter is slow.\n\n[[Category:Measurement]]\n\n\n{{measurement-stub}}"}]}}}}
