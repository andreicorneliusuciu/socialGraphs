The familiar [[Conducting|conductor]] of an orchestra serves to keep the orchestra ''in time''. Systems operating with all their parts in synchrony are said to be ''synchronous'' or ''in sync''; those which are not are ''asynchronous''.\n\nToday, synchronization can occur on a global basis through the [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]-enabled timekeeping systems (and similar independent systems operated by the EU and Russia).\n\n== Transport ==\nTime-keeping and synchronization of clocks was a critical problem in long-distance ocean navigation; accurate time is required in conjunction with astronomical observations to determine how far East or West a vessel has traveled.  The invention of an accurate [[marine chronometer]] revolutionized marine navigation. By the end of the 19th century, [[time signal]]s in the form of a signal gun, flag, or dropping [[time ball]], were provided at important ports so that mariners could check their chronometers for error.\n\nSynchronization was important in the operation of 19th century railways, these being the first major means of transport fast enough for the differences in local time between adjacent towns to be noticeable. Each line handled the problem by synchronizing all its stations to headquarters as a standard [[Time zone#Railroad time|railroad time]]. In some territories, sharing of single railroad tracks was controlled by the timetable.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The need for strict timekeeping led the companies to settle on one standard, and civil authorities eventually abandoned local [[mean solar time]] in favor of that standard.\n\n== Communication ==\n{{further information|Synchronization in telecommunications}}\nIn [[electrical engineering]] terms, for digital logic and data transfer, a [[synchronous circuit]] requires a [[clock signal]].  However, the use of the word \"clock\" in this sense is different from the typical sense of a clock as a device that keeps track of time-of-day; the clock signal simply signals the start and/or end of some time period, often very minute (measured in microseconds or nanoseconds), that has an arbitrary relationship to sidereal, solar, or lunar time, or to any other system of measurement of the passage of minutes, hours, and days.\n\nIn a different sense, electronic systems are sometimes synchronized to make events at points far apart appear simultaneous or near-simultaneous from a certain perspective.  (Albert Einstein proved in 1905 in his first relativity paper that there actually are no such things as absolutely simultaneous events.)  Timekeeping technologies such as the [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] satellites and [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP) provide real-time access to a close approximation to the [[UTC]] timescale and are used for many terrestrial synchronization applications of this kind.\n\nSynchronization  is an important concept in the following fields:\n* [[Synchronization (computer science)|Computer science]] (In computer science, especially [[parallel computing]], synchronization refers to the coordination of simultaneous [[thread (computing)|threads]] or [[Process (computing)|processes]] to complete a task with correct runtime order and no unexpected [[race condition]]s.)\n* [[Cryptography]]\n* [[Multimedia]]\n* [[Music]] (Rhythm)\n* [[Neural synchronization|Neuroscience]]\n* [[Photography]]\n* [[Physics]] (The idea of [[simultaneity]] has many difficulties, both in practice and theory.)\n* [[Oscillator sync|Synthesizers]]\n* [[Telecommunication]]\n\n== Synchronization (Dynamical Systems) ==\nSynchronization of multiple interacting dynamical systems can occur when the systems are autonomous oscillators.  For instance, integrate-and-fire oscillators with either two-way (symmetric) or one-way coupling can synchronize when the strength of the coupling (in frequency units) is greater than the differences among the free-running natural oscillator frequencies.  Poincare phase oscillators are model systems that can interact and partially synchronize within random or regular networks.<ref name=\"Nolte\">{{cite book | first = David | last = Nolte | title = Introduction to Modern Dynamics: Chaos, Networks, Space and Time  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] |  year = 2015 }}</ref>  In the case of global synchronization of phase oscillators, an abrupt transition from unsynchronized to full synchronization takes place when the coupling strength exceeds a critical threshold.  This is known as the [[Kuramoto model]] phase transition.  Synchronization is an emergent property that occurs in a broad range of dynamical systems, including neural signaling, the beating of the heart and the synchronization of fire-fly light waves.\n\n== Uses ==\n* Film synchronization of image and sound in [[sound film]].\n* Synchronization is important in fields such as [[digital telephony]], [[video]] and [[digital audio]] where streams of sampled data are manipulated.\n* In [[electric power]] systems, [[alternator synchronization]] is required when multiple generators are connected to an electrical grid.\n* [[Arbiter (electronics)|Arbiters]] are needed in digital electronic systems such as [[microprocessor]]s to deal with asynchronous inputs.  There are also electronic digital circuits called ''synchronizers'' that attempt to perform arbitration in one clock cycle.  Synchronizers, unlike arbiters, are prone to failure.  (See [[metastability in electronics]]).\n* [[Encryption]] systems usually require some synchronization mechanism to ensure that the receiving cipher is decoding the right bits at the right time.\n* Automotive [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]s contain [[synchromesh|synchronizer]]s that bring the toothed rotating parts (gears and splined shaft) to the same rotational velocity before engaging the teeth.\n* [[Film]], [[video]], and [[sound|audio]] applications use [[time code]] to synchronize audio and video.\n* [[Flash (photo)|Flash]] [[photography]], see [[Flash synchronization]]\n\nSome systems may be only approximately synchronized, or [[plesiochronous]]. Some applications require that relative offsets between events be determined. For others, only the [[Partially ordered set|order]] of the event is important.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Time}}\n{{cmn|4|\n* [[Asynchrony (disambiguation)|Asynchrony]]\n* [[Atomic clock]]\n* [[Clock synchronization]]\n* [[Data synchronization]]\n* [[Double-ended synchronization]]\n* [[Einstein synchronization]]\n* [[Entrainment (physics)|Entrainment]]\n* [[File synchronization]]\n* [[Flywheel]]\n* [[Homochronous]]\n* [[Kuramoto model]]\n* [[Mutual exclusion]]\n* [[Neural synchronization]]\n* [[Phase-locked loop]]s\n* [[Phase synchronization]]\n* [[Reciprocal socialization]]\n* [[Synchronism]]\n* [[Synchronization (alternating current)]]\n* [[Synchronization in telecommunications]]\n* [[Synchronization of chaos]]\n* [[Synchronization rights]]\n* [[Synchronizer]]\n* [[Synchronous conferencing]]\n* [[Time]]\n* [[Timing Synchronization Function]] (TSF)\n* [[Time transfer]]\n* [[Timecode]]\n* [[Tuning fork]]\n\n;Order synchronization and related topics:\n* [[Rendezvous problem]]\n* [[Interlocking]]\n* [[Race condition]]\n* [[Concurrency control]]\n* [[Room synchronization]]\n* [[Comparison of synchronous and asynchronous signalling]]\n\n;Video and audio engineering\n* [[Genlock]]\n* [[Jam sync]]\n* [[Word sync]]\n\n;Aircraft gun engineering:\n* [[Synchronization gear]]\n\n;Compare with:\n* [[Synchronicity]], an alternative organizing principle to causality conceived by [[Carl Jung]].\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* J.
