It was developed in [[Germany]], based on [[Wire recording|magnetic wire recording]].  Devices that record and play back audio and video using magnetic tape are [[tape recorder]]s and [[video tape recorder]]s.  A device that stores computer data on magnetic tape is a [[tape drive]] (tape unit, streamer).\n\nMagnetic tape revolutionized broadcast and recording.  When all [[radio]] was live, it allowed programming to be recorded.  At a time when [[gramophone record]]s were recorded in one take, it allowed recordings to be made in multiple parts, which were then mixed and edited with tolerable loss in quality.  It was a key technology in early computer development, allowing unparalleled amounts of data to be mechanically created, stored for long periods, and to be rapidly accessed.\n\nNowadays, other technologies can perform the functions of magnetic tape.  In many cases, these technologies are replacing tape.  Despite this, innovation in the technology continues, and [[Sony]] and [[IBM]] continue to produce new magnetic tape drives.<ref name=\"Sony2014\"/>\n\nOver years, magnetic tape made in the 1970s and 1980s can suffer from a type of deterioration called [[sticky-shed syndrome]].  Caused by hydrolysis of the binder of the tape, it can render the tape unusable.<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.unesco.org/webworld/mdm/administ/en/guide/guide008.htm|title=MEMORY OF THE WORLD: Safeguarding the Documentary Heritage.

This is the side that stores the information, the opposite side is simply a substrate to hold the tape together. The name originates from the fact that the magnetic side of most tapes is made of an [[oxide]] of [[iron]]. Sometimes [[chromium]] is also used.\n\n== Audio recording ==\n[[File:Kaseta magnetofonowa ubt.jpeg|thumb|[[Compact Cassette]] ]]\n{{Main|Magnetic tape sound recording}}\n\nMagnetic tape was invented for recording sound by [[Fritz Pfleumer]] in 1928 in Germany, based on the invention of magnetic wire recording by [[Oberlin Smith]] in 1888 and [[Valdemar Poulsen]] in 1898.  Pfleumer's invention used a [[iron(III) oxide|ferric oxide]] ({{chem|Fe|2|O|3}}) powder coating on a long strip of paper.  This invention was further developed by the German electronics company [[AEG]], which manufactured the recording machines and [[BASF]], which manufactured the tape. In 1933, working for AEG, [[Eduard Schuller]] developed the ring-shaped tape head. Previous head designs were needle-shaped and tended to shred the tape. An important discovery made in this period was the technique of [[tape bias|AC biasing]], which improved the fidelity of the recorded audio signal by increasing the effective linearity of the recording medium.\n\nDue to the escalating political tensions, and the outbreak of [[World War II]], these developments were largely kept secret. Although the Allies knew from their monitoring of Nazi radio broadcasts that the Germans had some new form of recording technology, the nature was not discovered until the Allies acquired captured German recording equipment as they invaded Europe in the closing of the war. It was only after the war that Americans, particularly [[Jack Mullin]], [[John Herbert Orr]], and [[Richard H. Ranger]], were able to bring this technology out of Germany and develop it into commercially viable formats.\n\nA wide variety of recorders and formats have developed since, most significantly [[reel-to-reel]] and [[Compact Cassette]].\n\n== Video recording ==\n{{Main|Videotape}}\n\nThe practice of recording and editing audio using magnetic tape rapidly established itself as an obvious improvement over previous methods. Many saw the potential of making the same improvements in recording television. Television (\"video\") signals are similar to audio signals. A major difference is that video signals use more [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] than audio signals. Existing audio tape recorders could not practically capture a video signal. Many set to work on resolving this problem. Jack Mullin (working for [[Bing Crosby]]) and the BBC both created crude working systems that involved moving the tape across a fixed tape head at very fast speeds. Neither system saw much use. It was the team at [[Ampex]], led by [[Charles Ginsburg]], that made the breakthrough of using a spinning recording head and normal tape speeds to achieve a very high head-to-tape speed that could record and reproduce the high bandwidth signals of video. The Ampex system was called [[Quadruplex videotape|Quadruplex]] and used {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} tape, mounted on reels like audio tape, which wrote the signal in what is now called transverse scan.\n\n[[File:VHS head drum 2.jpg|thumb|A [[VHS]] helical scan head drum. Helical and transverse scans made possible to increase the data bandwidth to the necessary point for recording video on tapes, and not just audio.]]\n\nLater improvements by other companies, particularly [[Sony]], lead to the development of [[helical scan]] and the enclosure of the tape reels in an easy-to-handle [[videocassette]] cartridge.  Nearly all modern videotape systems use helical scan and cartridges.  [[Videocassette recorder]]s used to be common in homes and television production facilities, but many functions of the VCR are being replaced.  Since the advent of digital video and computerized video processing, [[optical disc]] media and [[digital video recorder]]s can now perform the same role as videotape.  These devices also offer improvements like [[random access]] to any scene in the recording and \"live\" [[time shifting]] and have replaced videotape in many situations.\n\n== Data storage ==\n{{Main|Magnetic tape data storage}}\n\nIn all tape formats, a [[tape drive]] (or \"transport\" or \"deck\") uses motors to wind the tape from one reel to another, passing [[tape head]]s to read, write or erase as it moves.\n\nMagnetic tape was first used to record computer data in 1951 on the Eckert-Mauchly [[UNIVAC I]]. The recording medium was a thin strip of one half inch (12.65&nbsp;mm) wide metal, consisting of nickel-plated bronze (called Vicalloy).  Recording density was 128 characters per inch (198 micrometre/character) on eight tracks.\n\n[[File:Tapesticker.jpg|thumb|left|Small open reel of [[9 track tape]] ]]\n[[IBM 7 track|Early IBM tape drives]] were floor-standing drives that used [[Vacuum column (tape drive)|vacuum columns]] to physically buffer long U-shaped loops of tape. The two tape reels visibly fed tape through the columns, intermittently spinning the reels in rapid, unsynchronized bursts, resulting in visually striking action. Stock shots of such vacuum-column tape drives in motion were widely used to represent \"the computer\" in movies and television.\n\n[[File:Quarter-Inch Cartridges.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quarter inch cartridge]]s, a data format commonly used in the 1980s and 1990s.]]\n\nMost modern magnetic tape systems use reels that are much smaller than the 10.5&nbsp;inch open reels and are fixed inside a cartridge to protect the tape and facilitate handling.  Many late 1970s and early 1980s home computers used [[Compact Cassette]]s, encoded with the [[Kansas City standard]], or several other \"standards\" such as the [[Tarbell Cassette Interface]].  Modern cartridge formats include [[Linear Tape-Open|LTO]], [[Digital Linear Tape|DLT]], and [[Digital Data Storage|DAT/DDC]].\n\nTape remains a viable alternative to disk in some situations due to its lower cost per bit. This is a large advantage when dealing with large amounts of data. Though the areal density of tape is lower than for disk drives, the available surface area on a tape is far greater. The highest capacity tape media are generally on the same order as the largest available disk drives (about 5 [[Terabyte|TB]] in 2011). Tape has historically offered enough advantage in cost over disk storage to make it a viable product, particularly for [[backup]], where media removability is necessary.\n\nTape has the benefit of a comparatively long duration during which the media can be guaranteed to retain the data stored on the media. Fifteen (15) to thirty (30) years of archival data storage is cited by manufacturers of modern data tape such as [[Linear Tape-Open]] media.\n\nIn 2002, [[Imation]] received a [[US$]]11.9 million grant from the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] for research into increasing the data capacity of magnetic tape.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Future of Tape: Containing the Information Explosion|url=http://www.imation.com/euc/pdfs/EUC_07_Qualls.pdf|accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014 [[Sony]]  and [[IBM]] announced that they had been able to record 148 gigabits per square inch with magnetic tape media developed using  a new vacuum thin-film forming technology able to form extremely fine crystal particles, allowing true tape capacity of 185 TB.<ref name=\"Sony2014\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201404/14-044E/index.html |title=Sony develops magnetic tape technology with the world's highest*1 areal recording density of 148 Gb/in2|publisher=Sony Global |accessdate=4 May 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"Finags\">{{cite news|url=http://www.engadget.com/2014/04/30/sony-185tb-data-tape/|title=Sony's 185TB data tape puts your hard drive to shame |last=Fingas|first=Jon|date=4 May 2014|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Magnetic storage]]\n*[[Magnetic developer]]\n*[[Optical disc]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{FOLDOC}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons and category|Tape|Magnetic tapes}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040603152849/http://www.tvhandbook.com/History/History_recording.htm History of Tape Recording Technology]\n\n{{Magnetic storage media}}\n{{Music technology}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Audio storage]]\n[[Category:Computer storage tape media]]\n[[Category:Magnetic devices]]\n[[Category:Sound recording]]\n[[Category:Tape recording]]"}]}}}}
