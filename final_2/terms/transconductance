Conductance is the reciprocal of resistance.\n\n'''Transadmittance''' (or '''transfer [[admittance]]''') is the [[Alternating current|AC]] equivalent of transconductance.\n\n== Definition ==\n[[Image:Image for Transconductance.svg|right|thumb|150px|Model transconductance device]]\nIt is very often denoted as a conductance, ''g''<sub>m</sub>, with a subscript, m, for ''mutual''. Transconductance is defined as follows:\n:<math>g_m = \\frac{\\Delta I_\\text{out}}{\\Delta V_\\text{in}}</math>\n\nFor [[small signal]] [[alternating current]], the definition is simpler:\n:<math>g_m = \\frac{i_\\text{out}}{v_\\text{in}}</math>\n\nThe [[SI]] unit, the '''[[siemens (unit)|siemens]]''',  with the symbol, '''S'''; 1 siemens = 1 ampere per volt replaced the old unit of conductance, having the same definition, the ''mho'' (ohm spelled backwards), symbol, '''\u2127'''.\n\n== Transresistance ==\n\n'''Transresistance''' (for '''transfer resistance'''), also infrequently referred to as '''mutual resistance''', is the dual of transconductance.  It refers to the ratio between a change of the voltage at two output points and a related change of current through two input points, and is notated as r<sub>m</sub>:\n\n:<math>r_m = \\frac{\\Delta V_\\text{out}}{\\Delta I_\\text{in}}</math>\n\nThe SI unit for transresistance is simply the [[ohm (unit)|ohm]], as in resistance.\n\n'''Transimpedance''' (or, '''transfer [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]''') is the AC equivalent of transresistance, and is the dual of transadmittance.\n\n== Devices ==\n\n===Vacuum tubes===\nFor [[vacuum tube]]s, transconductance is defined as the change in the plate(anode)/cathode current divided by the corresponding change in the grid/cathode voltage, with a constant plate(anode)/cathode voltage. Typical values of g<sub>m</sub> for a small-signal vacuum tube are 1 to 10 millisiemens.  It is one of the three characteristic constants of a vacuum tube, the other two being its [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] \u03bc (mu) and plate resistance r<sub>p</sub> or r<sub>a</sub>. The [[Hendrik van der Bijl|Van der Bijl]] equation defines their relation as follows:\n:<math>g_m = \\frac{\\mu}{r_p}</math><ref>Blencowe, Merlin (2009). \"Designing Tube Amplifiers for Guitar and Bass\".</ref>\n\n===Field effect transistors===\nSimilarly, in [[field effect transistor]]s, and [[MOSFET]]s in particular, transconductance is the change in the drain current divided by the small change in the gate/source voltage with a constant drain/source voltage. Typical values of ''g''<sub>''m''</sub> for a small-signal field effect transistor are 1 to 30 millisiemens.\n\nUsing the [[Channel length modulation#Shichman\u2013Hodges model|Shichman\u2013Hodges model]], the transconductance for the MOSFET can be expressed as (see [[MOSFET#Modes of operation|MOSFET]] article):\n:<math>g_m = \\frac{2I_D}{V_\\text{eff}}</math>\n\nwhere ''I<sub>D</sub>'' is the DC drain current at the [[bias point]], and ''V''<sub>''eff''</sub> is the effective voltage, which is the difference between the bias point gate\u2013source voltage and the [[threshold voltage]] (i.e., ''V''<sub>''eff''</sub> \u2261 ''V''<sub>''GS''</sub> - ''V''<sub>''th''</sub>).<ref name=Sedra>\n{{citation\n |last1=Sedra\n |first1=A.S.\n |last2=Smith\n |first2=K.C.\n |title=Microelectronic Circuits\n |year=1998\n |edition=Fourth\n |publisher=Oxford University Press\n |location=New York\n |isbn=0-19-511663-1\n |url=http://worldcat.org/isbn/0-19-514251-9\n}}</ref>{{rp|p.&nbsp;395, Eq.&nbsp;(5.45)}} The effective voltage (otherwise known as the overdrive voltage) is customarily chosen at about 70\u2013200&nbsp;mV for the [[65 nanometer|65 nm]] technology node (''I<sub>D</sub>'' \u2248 1.13&nbsp;mA/\u03bcm of width) for a ''g''<sub>''m''</sub> of 11\u201332&nbsp;mS/\u03bcm.<ref name=Baker>\n{{citation\n |last=Baker\n |first=R.&nbsp;Jacob\n |title=CMOS Circuit Design, Layout, and Simulation, Third Edition,\n |year=2010\n |publisher=Wiley-IEEE\n |location=New York\n |isbn=978-0-470-88132-3\n |url=http://worldcat.org/isbn/978-0-470-88132-3\n}}</ref>{{rp|p.&nbsp;300, Table&nbsp;9.2}}<ref name=Sansen>\n{{citation\n |last=Sansen\n |first=W.M.C.\n |title=Analog Design Essentials\n |year=2006\n |publisher=Springer\n |location=Dordrecht\n |isbn=0-387-25746-2\n |url=http://worldcat.org/isbn/0387257462\n}}</ref>{{rp|p.&nbsp;15, \u00a70127}}\n\nAdditionally, the transconductance for the junction FET is given by <math>g_m = \\frac{{2I_{DSS} }}{{\\left| {V_P } \\right|}}\\left( {1 - \\frac{{V_{GS} }}{{V_P }}} \\right)</math>, where V<sub>P</sub> is the pinchoff voltage and I<sub>DSS</sub> is the maximum drain current.\n\nTraditionally, the transconductance for the FET and MOSFET as given in the equations above is derived from the transfer equation of each device, using [[calculus]]. However, Cartwright<ref>\n{{citation\n |last=Cartwright\n |first=Kenneth V\n |title=Derivation of the Exact Transconductance of a FET without Calculus\n |journal=The Technology Interface Journal\n |volume=10\n |issue=1\n |pages=7 pages\n |date=Fall 2009\n |url=http://tiij.org/issues/issues/fall09/Fall09/011.pdf\n}}</ref> has shown that this can be done without calculus.\n\n===Bipolar transistors===\nThe g<sub>m</sub> of [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] small-signal transistors varies widely, being proportional to the collector current. It has a typical range of 1 to 400 millisiemens. The input voltage change is applied between the base/emitter and the output is the change in collector current flowing between the collector/emitter with a constant collector/emitter voltage.\n\nThe transconductance for the bipolar transistor can be expressed as\n:<math>g_m = \\frac{I_C}{V_{T}}</math>\n\nwhere ''I<sub>C</sub>'' = DC collector current at the [[Q-point]], and ''V<sub>T</sub>'' = [[Boltzmann constant#Role in semiconductor physics: the thermal voltage|thermal voltage]], typically about 26 mV at room temperature. For a typical current of 10 mA, ''g<sub>m</sub>'' \u2248 385 mS.\n\nThe output (collector) conductance is determined by the [[Early voltage]] and is proportional to the collector current. For most transistors in linear operation it is well below 100 \u00b5S.\n\n==Amplifiers==\n\n===Transconductance amplifiers===\nA '''transconductance amplifier''' (''g''{{sub|m}} amplifier) puts out a current proportional to its input voltage. In  '''[[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|network analysis]]''', the transconductance amplifier is defined as a ''voltage controlled current source'' (''VCCS'') . It is common to see these amplifiers installed in a [[cascode]] configuration, which improves the frequency response.\n\n===Transresistance amplifiers===\n{{Main article|transimpedance amplifier}}\nA '''transresistance amplifier''' outputs a voltage proportional to its input current. The transresistance amplifier is often referred to as a '''transimpedance amplifier''', especially by semiconductor manufacturers.\n\nThe term for a transresistance amplifier in network analysis is ''current controlled voltage source'' (''CCVS'').\n\nA basic inverting transresistance amplifier can be built from an [[operational amplifier]] and a single resistor. Simply connect the resistor between the output and the inverting input of the operational amplifier and connect the non-inverting input to ground. The output voltage will then be proportional to the input current at the inverting input, decreasing with increasing input current and vice versa.  In practice, the parasitic capacitance of whatever device is connected to the virtual ground of the op-amp may destabilize it, and a compensating capacitance must be added in parallel with the resistor between the output and inverting pins.  Arriving at the optimal value of this compensating capacitor can be non-trivial.\n\nSpecialist chip transresistance (transimpedance) amplifiers are widely used for amplifying the signal current from photo diodes at the receiving end of ultra high speed fibre optic links. The MAX3724 and MAX3725 [http://pdfserv.maxim-ic.com/en/ds/MAX3724-MAX3725.pdf] are examples.\n\n===Operational transconductance amplifiers===\nAn [[operational transconductance amplifier]] (OTA) is an integrated circuit which can function as a transconductance amplifier. These normally have an input to allow the transconductance to be controlled.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Transistor]]\n* [[Vacuum tube]]\n* [[Electronic amplifier]]\n* [[Transimpedance amplifier]]\n* [[Fontana bridge]]\n* [[Operational transconductance amplifier]]\n* [[MOSFET]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{Citation|author=[[Paul Horowitz|Horowitz, Paul]] & [[Winfield Hill|Hill, Winfield]]|title=[[The Art of Electronics (book)|The Art of Electronics]]|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1989|isbn=0-521-37095-7}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|transconductance}}\n* [http://searchsmb.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,290660,sid44_gci214200,00.html Transconductance] \u2014 SearchSMB.com Definitions\n* Transconductance in audio amplifiers: article by David Wright of Pure Music  [http://www.beauhorn.com/articles/TC_amps_&_SD_horns.html]\n\n<!--Categories-->\n[[Category:Electronics terminology]]"}]}}}}
