It is a way of interconnecting two circuits such that, in addition to transferring the AC signal (or information), the first stage also provides [[DC bias]] to the next.  Thus, there is no need for a DC blocking capacitor to be used in order to interconnect the circuits. Conductive coupling passes the full spectrum of [[Frequency|frequencies]] including [[direct current]].\n\nSuch [[coupling (electronics)|coupling]] may be achieved by a [[wire]], [[resistor]], or common [[terminal (electronics)|terminal]], such as a [[binding post]] or metallic [[chemical bond|bonding]]. \n\n==DC bias==\nThe provision of DC bias only occurs in a group of circuits that forms a single unit, such as an [[operational amplifier|op-amp]]. Here the internal units or portions of the op-amp (like the input stage, voltage gain stage, and output stage) will be direct coupled and will also be used to set up the bias conditions inside the op-amp (the input stage will also supply the input bias to the voltage gain stage, for example). However when two op-amps are directly coupled the first op-amp will supply any bias to the next - any DC at its output will form the input for the next. The resulting output of the second op-amp now represents an offset error if it is not the intended one.\n\n==Uses==\nThis technique is used by default in circuits like [[integrated circuit|IC]] [[operational amplifier|op-amp]]s, since large coupling [[capacitor]]s cannot be fabricated on-chip. That said, some discrete circuits (such as [[power amplifier]]s) also employ direct coupling to cut cost and improve low frequency performance.\n\n==Offset error==\nOne advantage or disadvantage (depending on application) of direct coupling is that any DC at the input appears as a valid ''signal'' to the system, and so it will be transferred from the input to the output (or between two directly coupled circuits). If this is not a desired result, then the term used for the output signal is ''output offset error'', and the corresponding input signal is known as ''input offset error''. \n\n===Error correction===\nTemperature drift and device mismatches are the major causes of offset errors, and circuits employing direct coupling often integrate offset nulling mechanisms. Some circuits (like power amplifiers) even use coupling capacitors&mdash;except that these are present ''only'' at the input (and/or output) of the whole system but not between the individual circuit units inside the system.\n\n==Advantages==\nThe advantage of direct coupling is very good low frequency response, often from DC to the highest operating frequency that the system will allow. All applications that require monitoring of slowly changing signals (such as those from [[thermistor]]s, [[thermocouple]]s, [[strain gage]]s, etc.) must have a very good DC amplification with minimum offset errors and hence they must be directly coupled throughout, and have offset correction or trimming incorporated into them.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Direct coupled amplifier]]\n* [[Electromagnetic compatibility]]\n* [[Electromagnetic interference]]\n* [[Ohmic contact]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{FS1037C MS188}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.learnemc.com/tutorials/Common_Impedance_Coupling/conducted_coupling.html Common Impedance Coupling]\n\n[[Category:Electromagnetic compatibility]]\n[[Category:Electronic amplifiers]]\n\n\n{{electronics-stub}}"}]}}}}
