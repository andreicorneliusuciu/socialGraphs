It was developed in 1886 by the German scientist [[Carl Gassner]].\n\nA dry cell uses a paste [[electrolyte]], with only enough [[moisture]] to allow current to flow. Unlike a [[wet cell]], a dry cell can operate in any orientation without spilling, as it contains no free liquid, making it suitable for portable equipment. By comparison, the first wet cells were typically fragile glass containers with lead rods hanging from the open top and needed careful handling to avoid [[spillage]]. [[Lead\u2013acid batteries|Lead-acid battery]] did not achieve the safety and portability of the dry cell until the development of the [[gel battery]].  Wet cells have continued to be used for high drain applications such as starting [[internal combustion engine]]s, because inhibiting electrolyte flow tends to reduce the current capability.\n\nA common dry cell is the [[zinc\u2013carbon battery|zinc-carbon cell]], sometimes called the dry [[Leclanch\u00e9 cell]], with a nominal voltage of 1.5 [[volt]]s, the same as the [[alkaline battery|alkaline cell]] (since both use the same [[zinc]]\u2013[[manganese dioxide]] combination).\n\nA standard dry cell comprises a [[zinc]] [[anode]], usually in the form of a cylindrical pot, with a [[carbon]] [[cathode]] in the form of a central rod. The [[electrolyte]] is [[ammonium chloride]] in the form of a paste next to the zinc anode. The remaining space between the electrolyte and carbon cathode is taken up by a second paste consisting of [[ammonium chloride]] and [[manganese dioxide]], the latter acting as a [[depolariser]]. In some designs, the ammonium chloride is replaced by [[zinc chloride]].\n\n==History==\n\nMany experimenters tried to immobilize the electrolyte of an electrochemical cell to make it more convenient to use. The [[Zamboni pile]] of 1812 was a high-voltage dry battery but capable of delivering only minute currents. Various experiments were made with cellulose, sawdust, spun glass, asbestos fibers, and gelatine.<ref>W. E. Ayrton ''Practical Electricity; A Laboratory and Lecture Course for First Year ...'' 1897, reprint Read Books, 2008 ISBN 1-4086-9150-7, page 458</ref>\n\nIn 1886, Carl Gassner obtained a German patent (No. 37,758) on a variant of the Leclanch\u00e9 cell, which came to be known as the dry cell because it did not have a free liquid electrolyte. Instead, the ammonium chloride was mixed with [[Plaster of Paris]] to create a paste, with a small amount of [[zinc chloride]] added in to extend the shelf life. The [[manganese dioxide]] cathode was dipped in this paste, and both were sealed in a zinc shell, which also acted as the anode. In November 1887, he obtained {{US Patent|373064}} for the same device.<ref>http://todayinsci.com/G/Gassner_Carl/GassnerPatent373064.htm</ref>\n\nUnlike previous wet cells, Gassner's dry cell was more solid, did not require maintenance, did not spill, and could be used in any orientation. It provided a potential of 1.5 volts. The first mass-produced model was the Columbia dry cell, first marketed by the [[National Carbon Company]] in 1896.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Columbia Dry Cell Battery | work = National Historic Chemical Landmarks | publisher = American Chemical Society | url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/drycellbattery.html | accessdate = 2014-02-21 }}</ref> The NCC improved Gassner's model by replacing the plaster of Paris with coiled cardboard, an innovation that left more space for the cathode and made the battery easier to assemble. It was the first convenient battery for the masses and made portable electrical devices practical.\n\nThe [[zinc-carbon battery|zinc-carbon cell]] (as it came to be known) are still manufactured today.\n\n==Dry cell types==\n*[[Primary cell]]\n**Zinc-carbon cells, also known as [[Leclanch\u00e9 cell]]s\n**[[Alkaline battery|Alkaline cell]]\n**[[Lithium battery|Lithium cell]]\n**[[Mercury battery|Mercury cell]] \n**[[Silver oxide battery|silver oxide cell]]\n*[[Secondary cell]]\n**[[Nickel-cadmium ba ttery|Nickel-cadmium cell]]\n**[[Lithium ion battery|Lithium ion cell]]\n**[[Nickel metal hydride battery|Nickel metal hydride cell]]\n\nPrimary cells are not [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable]] and are generally disposed of after their chemicals have been used up through the cell's internal reaction.\n\nSecondary cells are rechargeable, and may be reused multiple times.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rechargeable battery]]\n*[[Wet cell]]\n\n== References==\n<References/>\n\n{{Galvanic cells}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Chemistry]]\n[[Category:Dry cell batteries]]"}]}}}}
