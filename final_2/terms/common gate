In this circuit the source terminal of the transistor serves as the input, the drain is the output and the gate is connected to ground, or \"common,\" hence its name. \nThe analogous [[bipolar junction transistor]] circuit is the [[common base|common-base amplifier]].\n\n==Applications==\n\nThis configuration is used less often than the [[common source]] or [[source follower]]. It is useful in, for example, CMOS RF receivers, especially when operating near the frequency limitations of the FETs; it is desirable because of the ease of [[impedance matching]] and potentially has lower [[Electronic noise|noise]].

Because the amplifier input resistance is small, the driver delivers by [[current division]] a current ''v<sub>Th\u00e9v</sub> / R<sub>S</sub>'' to the amplifier. The current gain is unity, so the same current is delivered to the output load ''R<sub>L</sub>'', producing by Ohm's law an output voltage ''v<sub>out</sub> = v<sub>Th\u00e9v</sub>R<sub>L</sub> / R<sub>S</sub>'', that is, the first form of the voltage gain above.\n\nIn the second case ''R<sub>S</sub>'' << 1/''g<sub>m</sub>'' and the Th\u00e9venin representation of the source is useful, producing the second form for the gain, typical of voltage amplifiers.\n\nBecause the input impedance of the common-gate amplifier is very low, the [[cascode]] amplifier often is used instead. The cascode places a [[common-source]] amplifier between the voltage driver and the common-gate circuit to permit voltage amplification using a driver with ''R<sub>S</sub> >> 1/g<sub>m</sub>''.\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Electronic amplifier#Input and output variables|Electronic amplifier variables]]\n*[[Two-port network#Example: common base amplifier|Two-port network]]s\n*[[Common drain]]\n*[[Common source]]\n*[[Common base]]\n*[[Common emitter]]\n*[[Common collector]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://chic.caltech.edu/publication/a-24ghz-cmos-front-end/ A 24GHz CMOS Front-end]\n\n{{Transistor amplifiers}}\n\n[[Category:Single-stage transistor amplifiers]]"}]}}}}
