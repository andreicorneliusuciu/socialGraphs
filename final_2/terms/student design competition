Design competitions can be technical or purely aesthetic. The objective of technical competitions is to introduce students to real-world [[engineering]] situations and to teach students project-management and fabrication techniques used in industry. Aesthetic competitions usually require art and design skills.\n\nBoth students and industry benefit from intercollegiate design competitions.  Each competition allows students to apply the theories and information they have learning in the class room to real situations.  Industry gains better prepared and more experienced engineers.\n\n== History ==\n\nThrough the 1970s only one competition of significance existed: [[Mini Baja]].  Today, almost every field of engineering has several design competitions, which have extended from college down into high school (e.g., [[FIRST Robotics]]) and even younger grades (e.g., [[FIRST Lego League]]). The Society of Automotive Engineers organizes the largest design competitions, including Mini Baja, [[Sunryce]], and [[Formula SAE]].\n\n== Notable design competitions ==\n\n* Civil engineering\n** [[Great Northern Concrete Toboggan Race]]\n** [[Concrete canoe]]\n** [[Steel bridge competition|Steel bridge]]\n* Mechanical engineering\n** [[Baja SAE]]\n** [[Basic Utility Vehicle]]\n** [[Formula SAE]]\n* Robotics\n* [[RoboCup]] Soccer\n* [[International Space Settlement Design Competition]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Student competition]]\n* [[Student Competitions AB]]\n* [[UoP Racing team|University of Patras Formula Student Team - UoP Racing Team]]\n\n[[Category:Competitions]]\n[[Category:Student events]]"}]}}}}
