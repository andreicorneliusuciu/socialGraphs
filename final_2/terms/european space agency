The main European launch vehicle [[Ariane 5]] is operated through [[Arianespace]] with ESA sharing in the costs of launching and further developing this launch vehicle.\n\nIts facilities are distributed among the following 5 research centres:\n\n* ESA science missions are based at [[European Space Research and Technology Centre|ESTEC]] in [[Noordwijk]], Netherlands;\n* Earth Observation missions at [[ESRIN]] in [[Frascati]], Italy;\n* ESA Mission Control ([[European Space Operations Centre|ESOC]]) is in [[Darmstadt]], Germany;\n* the [[European Astronaut Centre]] (EAC) that trains astronauts for future missions is situated in [[Cologne]], Germany;\n* and the [[European Space Astronomy Centre]] (ESAC) is located in [[Villanueva de la Ca\u00f1ada]], [[Comunidad de Madrid|Madrid]], Spain.\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\n{{main|ESRO}}\n[[Image:ESA-ESTEC5.jpg|thumb|right|[[European Space Research and Technology Centre|ESTEC]] buildings in [[Noordwijk]], Netherlands. ESTEC was the main technical centre of ESRO and remains so for the successor organization, ESA.]]\n\nAfter [[World War II]], many European scientists left [[Western Europe]] in order to work with the United States. Although the 1950s boom made it possible for Western European countries to invest in research and specifically in space-related activities, Western European scientists realized solely national projects would not be able to compete with the two main superpowers. In 1958, only months after the [[Sputnik crisis|Sputnik shock]], [[Edoardo Amaldi]] and [[Pierre Auger]], two prominent members of the Western European scientific community at that time, met to discuss the foundation of a common Western European space agency. The meeting was attended by scientific representatives from eight countries, including [[Harrie Massey]] (UK).\n\nThe Western European nations decided to have two different agencies, one concerned with developing a launch system, [[European Launcher Development Organization|ELDO]] (European Launch Development Organization), and the precursor of the European Space Agency, [[ESRO]] (European Space Research Organisation). The latter was established on 20 March 1964 by an agreement signed on 14 June 1962. From 1968 to 1972, ESRO launched seven research satellites.\n\nESA in its current form was founded with the ESA Convention in 1975, when ESRO was merged with [[European Launcher Development Organization|ELDO]]. ESA has 10 founding member states: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://www.esa.int/For_Media/Press_Releases/ESA_turns_30!_A_successful_track_record_for_Europe_in_space | title = ESA turns 30! A successful track record for Europe in space | publisher = European Space Agency | date = 31 May 2005}}</ref> These signed the ESA Convention in 1975 and deposited the instruments of ratification by 1980, when the convention came into force. During this interval the agency functioned in a [[de facto]] fashion.<ref name=convention1 /> ESA launched its first major scientific mission in 1975, [[Cos-B]], a space probe monitoring gamma-ray emissions in the universe first worked on by ESRO.\n\n===Later activities===\n[[Image:Ariane 1 Le Bourget FRA 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mock-up of the [[Ariane 1]]]]\n\nESA joined NASA in the [[International Ultraviolet Explorer|IUE]], the world's first high-orbit [[telescope]], which was launched in 1978 and operated very successfully for 18 years. A number of successful Earth-orbit projects followed, and in 1986 ESA began [[Giotto mission|Giotto]], its first deep-space mission, to study the comets [[Comet Halley|Halley]] and [[26P/Grigg\u2013Skjellerup|Grigg\u2013Skjellerup]]. [[Hipparcos]], a star-mapping mission, was launched in 1989 and in the 1990s [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]], [[Ulysses probe|Ulysses]] and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] were all jointly carried out with [[NASA]]. Recent scientific missions in cooperation with NASA include the [[Cassini\u2013Huygens]] space probe, to which ESA contributed by building the [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] landing module [[Huygens probe|Huygens]].\n\nAs the successor of [[European Launcher Development Organisation|ELDO]], ESA has also constructed rockets for scientific and commercial payloads. [[Ariane 1]], launched in 1979, brought mostly commercial payloads into orbit from 1984 onward. The next two developments of the Ariane rocket were intermediate stages in the development of a more advanced launch system, the [[Ariane 4]], which operated between 1988 and 2003 and established ESA as the world leader{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} in commercial space launches in the 1990s. Although the succeeding [[Ariane 5]] experienced a failure on its first flight, it has since firmly established itself within the heavily competitive commercial space launch market with 56 successful launches as of September 2011. The successor launch vehicle of [[Ariane 5]], the [[Ariane 6]] is already in the definition stage and is envisioned to enter service in the 2020s.\n\nThe beginning of the new millennium saw ESA become, along with agencies like [[NASA]], [[JAXA]], [[ISRO]], [[Canadian Space Agency|CSA]] and [[Roscosmos]], one of the major participants in scientific [[Space science|space research]]. Although ESA had relied on cooperation with NASA in previous decades, especially the 1990s, changed circumstances (such as tough legal restrictions on information sharing by the [[Military of the United States|United States military]]) led to decisions to rely more on itself and on cooperation with Russia. A 2011 press issue thus stated:<ref name=international-coop />\n\n{{quote|Russia is ESA's first partner in its efforts to ensure long-term access to space. There is a framework agreement between ESA and the government of the Russian Federation on cooperation and partnership in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes, and cooperation is already under way in two different areas of launcher activity that will bring benefits to both partners.}}\n\nMost notable for its new self-confidence are ESA's own recent successful missions [[SMART-1]], a probe testing cutting-edge new space propulsion technology, the [[Mars Express]] and [[Venus Express]] missions as well as the development of the [[Ariane 5]] rocket and its role in the [[ISS]] partnership. ESA maintains its scientific and research projects mainly for astronomy-space missions such as [[Corot (space mission)|Corot]], launched on 27 December 2006, a milestone in the search for [[extra-solar planets]].\n\n==Mission==\nThe treaty establishing the European Space Agency reads:<ref name=\"treaty\">Article II, Purpose, Convention of establishment of a European Space Agency, SP-1271(E) from 2003 .{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/About_Us/Welcome_to_ESA/ESA_s_Purpose | title = ESA's Purpose | publisher = European Space Agency | date = 14 June 2007 |accessdate=6 September 2014}}</ref>\n{{quote|ESA's purpose shall be to provide for, and to promote, for exclusively peaceful purposes, cooperation among European States in space research and technology and their space applications, with a view to their being used for scientific purposes and for operational space applications systems}}\n\nESA is responsible for setting a unified space and related industrial policy, recommending space objectives to the member states, and integrating national programs like satellite development, into the European program as much as possible.<ref name=\"treaty\" />\n\n[[Jean-Jacques Dordain]] ESA's Director General (2003-2015) outlined the European Space Agency's mission in a 2003 interview:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jaxa.jp/news_topics/interview/vol4/index_e.html | title = Launching a New Era with JAXA: Interview with Jean-Jacques Dordain | publisher = [[JAXA]] | date = 31 October 2003}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Today space activities are pursued for the benefit of citizens, and citizens are asking for a better quality of life on earth.

First a Cooperation Agreement is signed between the country and ESA. In this stage, the country has very limited financial responsibilities. If a country wants to cooperate more fully with ESA, it signs a European Cooperating State (ECS) Agreement. The ECS Agreement makes companies based in the country eligible for participation in ESA procurements. The country can also participate in all ESA programmes, except for the Basic Technology Research Programme. While the financial contribution of the country concerned increases, it is still much lower than that of a full member state. The agreement is normally followed by a Plan For European Cooperating State (or PECS Charter). This is a 5-year programme of basic research and development activities aimed at improving the nation's space industry capacity. At the end of the 5-year period, the country can either begin negotiations to become a full member state or an associated state or sign a new PECS Charter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pecs.esa.int/node/24 |title=PECS: General Overview |publisher=European Space Agency |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523104757/http://pecs.esa.int/node/24 |archivedate=23 May 2009 }}</ref> Many countries, most of which joined the EU in both 2004 and 2007, have started to cooperate with ESA on various levels:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellspacing=\"2\"\n|-\n!

ESA's fleet consists of three major rocket designs: [[Ariane 5]], [[Soyuz-2 (rocket)|Soyuz-2]] and [[Vega (launcher)|Vega]]. Rocket launches are carried out by [[Arianespace]], which has 23 shareholders representing the industry that manufactures the Ariane 5 as well as [[CNES]], at ESA's [[Guiana Space Centre]]. Because many communication satellites have equatorial orbits, launches from French Guiana are able to take larger payloads into space than from spaceports at higher [[latitude]]s. In addition, equatorial launches give spacecraft an extra 'push' of nearly 500&nbsp;m/s due to the higher [[rotational velocity]] of the Earth at the equator compared to near the Earth's poles where rotational velocity approaches zero.\n\n===Ariane 5===\n{{main|Ariane 5}}\n[[File:Ariane 5ECA on its way to launch pad ELA-3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ariane 5]] ECA transported to the [[ELA-3]] launch pad]]\nThe Ariane 5 rocket is ESA's primary launcher. It has been in service since 1997 and replaced [[Ariane 4]]. Two different [[Ariane 5#Variants|variants]] are currently in use. The heaviest and most used version, the {{nowrap|Ariane 5 ECA}}, delivers two communications satellites of up to 10 tonnes into [[Geostationary transfer orbit|GTO]]. It failed during its first test flight in 2002, but has since made 71 consecutive successful [[Ariane 5#Ariane 5 flights|flights]] (as of March 2016). The other version, {{nowrap|Ariane 5 ES}}, was used to launch the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] (ATV) to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) and will be used to launch four [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] navigational satellites at a time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Launch vehicles - Ariane 5|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Launchers/Launch_vehicles/Ariane_5|publisher=www.esa.int|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Launchers/Launch_vehicles/Ariane_5_ES|title = Ariane 5 ES|date = |accessdate = 8 September 2014|website = ESA|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nIn November 2012, ESA agreed to build an upgraded variant called [[Ariane 5#Ariane 5 ME|{{nowrap|Ariane 5 ME}}]] (Mid-life Evolution) which will increase payload capacity to 11.5 tonnes to GTO and feature a restartable second stage to allow more complex missions.

Merbold.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ulf Merbold]] became the first ESA astronaut to fly into space.]]\nAt the time ESA was formed, its main goals did not encompass human space flight; rather it considered itself to be primarily a scientific research organisation for unmanned space exploration in contrast to its American and Soviet counterparts. It is therefore not surprising that the first non-Soviet European in space was not an ESA astronaut on a European space craft; it was [[Czechoslovak]] [[Vladim\u00edr Remek]] who in 1978 became the first non-Soviet or American in space (the first man in space being [[Yuri Gagarin]] of the Soviet Union) &mdash; on a [[Soviet space programme|Soviet]] [[Soyuz spacecraft]], followed by the [[Poles|Pole]] [[Miros\u0142aw Hermaszewski]] and [[East German]] [[Sigmund J\u00e4hn]] in the same year. This Soviet co-operation programme, known as [[Intercosmos]], primarily involved the participation of [[Eastern bloc]] countries. In 1982, however, [[Jean-Loup Chr\u00e9tien]] became the first [[Western Bloc|non-Communist Bloc]] astronaut on a flight to the Soviet [[Salyut 7]] space station.\n\nBecause Chr\u00e9tien did not officially fly into space as an ESA astronaut, but rather as a member of the French [[CNES]] astronaut corps, the German [[Ulf Merbold]] is considered the first ESA astronaut to fly into space. He participated in the [[STS-9]] [[Space Shuttle]] mission that included the first use of the European-built [[Spacelab]] in 1983. STS-9 marked the beginning of an extensive ESA/NASA joint partnership that included dozens of space flights of ESA astronauts in the following years. Some of these missions with Spacelab were fully funded and organizationally and scientifically controlled by [[ESA]] (such as two missions by Germany and one by Japan) with European astronauts as full crew members rather than guests on board. Beside paying for Spacelab flights and seats on the shuttles, ESA continued its human space flight co-operation with the [[Soviet Union]] and later Russia, including numerous visits to [[Mir]].\n\nDuring the latter half of the 1980s, European human space flights changed from being the exception to routine and therefore, in 1990, the [[European Astronaut Centre]] in [[Cologne]], Germany was established. It selects and trains prospective astronauts and is responsible for the co-ordination with international partners, especially with regard to the [[International Space Station]]. As of 2006, the ESA astronaut corps officially included twelve members, including nationals from most large European countries except the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the summer of 2008, ESA started to recruit new astronauts so that final selection would be due in spring 2009. Almost 10,000 people registered as astronaut candidates before registration ended in June 2008. 8,413 fulfilled the initial application criteria. Of the applicants, 918 were chosen to take part in the first stage of psychological testing, which narrowed down the field to 192. After two-stage psychological tests and medical evaluation in early 2009, as well as formal interviews, six new members of the [[European Astronaut Corps]] were selected - five men and one woman.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Closing_in_on_new_astronauts | title = Closing in on new astronauts | date = 24 September 2008 | accessdate=6 September 2014 | publisher = European Space Agency}}</ref>\n\n===Astronaut names===\n{{See also|European Astronaut Corps}}\n\nThe astronauts of the European Space Agency are:\n{{colbegin||22em}}\n*{{flagicon|France}} [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Clervoy]]<ref group=note name=Mir />\n*{{flagicon|Italy}}   [[Samantha Cristoforetti]]<ref group=note name=selection2009 /><ref group=note name=ISS />\n*{{flagicon|Belgium|state}} [[Frank De Winne]]<ref group=note name=ISS />\n*{{flagicon|Spain}}   [[Pedro Duque]]<ref group=note name=ISS />\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Reinhold Ewald]]<ref group=note name=Mir />\n*{{flagicon|France}} [[L\u00e9opold Eyharts]]<ref group=note name=Mir /><ref group=note name=ISS />\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Alexander Gerst]]<ref group=note name=selection2009 /><ref group=note name=ISS />\n*{{flagicon|Italy}}   [[Umberto Guidoni]]<ref group=note name=retired /><ref group=note name=ISS />\n*{{flagicon|Sweden}} [[Christer Fuglesang]]<ref group=note name=ISS />\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Andr\u00e9 Kuipers]]<ref group=note name=ISS />\n*{{flagicon|Denmark}} [[Andreas Mogensen]]<ref group=note name=selection2009 />\n*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Paolo A.

Around 1978 it was decided to pursue a reusable spacecraft model and starting in November 1987 a project to create a mini-shuttle by the name of [[Hermes (shuttle)|Hermes]] was introduced. The craft was comparable to early proposals for the [[Space Shuttle]] and consisted of a small reusable spaceship that would carry 3 to 5 astronauts and 3 to 4 metric tons of payload for scientific experiments. With a total maximum weight of 21 metric tons it would have been launched on the [[Ariane 5]] rocket, which was being developed at that time. It was planned solely for use in [[Low-Earth orbit]] space flights. The planning and pre-development phase concluded in 1991; the production phase was never fully implemented because at that time the political landscape had changed significantly. With the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] ESA looked forward to cooperation with Russia to build a next-generation space vehicle. Thus the Hermes programme was cancelled in 1995 after about 3 billion dollars had been spent. The [[Columbus Man-Tended Free Flyer|Columbus space station programme]] had a similar fate.\n\nIn the 21st century, ESA started new programmes in order to create its own crew vehicles, most notable among its various projects and proposals is [[Hopper (spacecraft)|Hopper]], whose prototype by [[EADS]], called [[EADS Phoenix|Phoenix]], has already been tested. While projects such as [[Hopper (spacecraft)|Hopper]] are neither concrete nor to be realised within the next decade, other possibilities for human spaceflight in cooperation with the [[Russian Space Agency]] have emerged. Following talks with the [[Russian Space Agency]] in 2004 and June 2005,<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/space/article/0,14493,1489679,00.html | date = 22 May 2005 | title = Europe to hitch space ride on Russia's rocket | first = Robin | last = McKie | work = [[The Observer]]}}</ref> a cooperation between ESA and the [[Russian Space Agency]] was announced to jointly work on the Russian-designed [[Kliper]], a reusable spacecraft that would be available for space travel beyond LEO (e.g. the moon or even Mars). It was speculated that Europe would finance part of it. A \u20ac50 million participation study for Kliper, which was expected to be approved in December 2005, was finally not approved by the ESA member states. The Russian state tender for the project was subsequently cancelled in 2006.\n\nIn June 2006, ESA member states granted 15 million to the [[CSTS|Crew Space Transportation System]] (CSTS) study, a two-year study to design a spacecraft capable of going beyond Low-Earth orbit based on the current [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]] design. This project was pursued with [[Roskosmos]] instead of the cancelled Kliper proposal. A decision on the actual implementation and construction of the CSTS spacecraft was contemplated for 2008.\nIn mid-2009 EADS Astrium was awarded a \u20ac21 million study into designing a crew vehicle based on the European ATV which is believed to now be the basis of the Advanced Crew Transportation System design.<ref>{{cite web|last=Coppinger |first=Rob |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/hyperbola/2009/07/picture-eads-astrium-wins-21-m.html |title=EADS Astrium wins \u20ac21 million reentry vehicle study |publisher=Flightglobal.com |date= |accessdate=29 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2012, ESA decided to join NASA's [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion programme]]. The ATV would form the basis of a propulsion unit for NASA's new manned spacecraft. ESA may also seek to work with NASA on Orion's launch system as well in order to secure a seat on the spacecraft for its own astronauts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/nov/17/britons-could-explore-deep-space|title=Project Orion raises hopes that Britain could have its own man on the moon|publisher=The Observer|date=17 November 2012|author=Robin McKie|accessdate=3 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2014, ESA signed an agreement with [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]] for cooperation in [[Dream Chaser]] project.

Its headquarters are in central [[Paris]]. CNES is the main participant on the Ariane project. Indeed, CNES designed and tested all Ariane family rockets (mainly from its centre in [[\u00c9vry, Essonne|\u00c9vry]] near [[Paris]])\n* The [[UK Space Agency]] is a partnership of the UK government departments which are active in space. Through the UK Space Agency, the partners provide delegates to represent the UK on the various ESA governing bodies. Each partner funds its own programme.\n* The [[Italian Space Agency]] (''Agenzia Spaziale Italiana'' or ASI) was founded in 1988 to promote, coordinate and conduct space activities in Italy. Operating under the Ministry of the Universities and of Scientific and Technological Research, the agency cooperates with numerous entities active in space technology and with the president of the Council of Ministers. Internationally, the ASI provides Italy's delegation to the Council of the European Space Agency and to its subordinate bodies.\n* The [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) (German: ''Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt e. V.'') is the national research centre for aviation and space flight of the Federal Republic of Germany and of other member states in the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres|Helmholtz Association]]. Its extensive research and development projects are included in national and international cooperative programmes. In addition to its research projects, the centre is the assigned space agency of Germany bestowing headquarters of German space flight activities and its associates.\n* The [[Instituto Nacional de T\u00e9cnica Aeroespacial]] (INTA) (National Institute for Aerospace Technique) is a Public Research Organization specialized in aerospace research and technology development in Spain. Between other functions, it serves as a platform for space research and acts as a significant testing facility for the aeronautic and space sector in the country.\n\n===NASA===\nESA has a long history of collaboration with [[NASA]]. Since ESA's astronaut corps was formed, the [[Space Shuttle]] has been the primary launch vehicle used by ESA's astronauts to get into space through partnership programmes with NASA. In the 1980s and 1990s, the [[Spacelab]] programme was an ESA-NASA joint research programme that had ESA develop and manufacture orbital labs for the Space Shuttle for several flights on which ESA participate with astronauts in experiments.\n\nIn robotic science mission and exploration missions, NASA has been ESA's main partner. [[Cassini\u2013Huygens]] was a joint NASA-ESA mission, along with the [[Infrared Space Observatory]], [[INTEGRAL]], [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]], and others. Also, the [[Hubble space telescope]] is a joint project of NASA and ESA. Future ESA-NASA joint projects include the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] and the proposed [[Laser Interferometer Space Antenna]]. NASA has committed to provide support to ESA's proposed [http://us-marcopolor.jhuapl.edu/ MarcoPolo-R] mission to return an asteroid sample to Earth for further analysis. NASA and ESA will also likely join together for a [[Mars Sample Return Mission]].\n\n===Cooperation with other space agencies===\nSince China has started to invest more money into space activities, the [[Chinese Space Agency]] has sought international partnerships.

Some 20 per cent of the funds managed by ESA now originate from the supranational [[budget of the European Union]].\n\nHowever, in recent years the ties between ESA and the European institutions have been reinforced by the increasing role that space plays in supporting Europe\u2019s social, political and economic policies.\n\nThe legal basis for the EU/ESA cooperation is provided by a Framework Agreement which entered into force in May 2004. According to this agreement, the European Commission and ESA coordinate their actions through the Joint Secretariat, a small team of EC\u2019s administrators and ESA executive. The Member States of the two organisations meet at ministerial level in the Space Council, which is a concomitant meeting of the EU and ESA Councils, prepared by Member States representatives in the High-level Space Policy Group (HSPG).\n\nESA maintains a liaison office in Brussels to facilitate relations with the European institutions.\n\n===Guaranteeing European access to space===\nIn May 2007, the 29 European countries expressed their support for the European Space Policy in a resolution of the Space Council, unifying the approach of ESA with those of the European Union and their member states.\n\nPrepared jointly by the European Commission and ESA\u2019s Director General, the European Space Policy sets out a basic vision and strategy for the space sector and addresses issues such as security and defence, access to space and exploration.\n\nThrough this resolution, the EU, ESA and their Member States all commit to increasing coordination of their activities and programmes and their respective roles relating to space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/About_Us/Welcome_to_ESA/ESA_and_the_EU|title=ESA and the EU|author=esa|work=European Space Agency|accessdate=3 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Agencies of the European Union]] and [[Enhanced co-operation]]\n* [[European integration]], section [[European integration#Space|Space]]\n* [[European Launcher Development Organisation]] (ELDO)\n* [[European Space Research Organisation]] (ESRO)\n* [[Eurospace]]\n* [[Director General of the European Space Agency|List of directors general of the European Space Agency]]\n* [[List of projects of the European Space Agency]]\n* [[Space policy of the European Union]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* [http://www.esa.int/esaMI/ESA_Publications/ ESA Bulletin] ([http://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESA_Publications/ESA_Publications_Bulletin]) is a quarterly magazine about the work of ESA that can be subscribed to [https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/EUESA/subscriber/new?topic_id=EUESA_42] free of charge.\n* Bonnet, Roger; Manno, Vittorio (1994).
