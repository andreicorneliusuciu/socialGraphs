The Control key is located on or near the bottom left side of most keyboards (in accordance with the international standard [[ISO/IEC 9995]]-2), with many featuring an additional one at the bottom right.\n\nIt is usually labeled {{keypress|Ctrl}} (rarely, {{keypress|Control}} or {{keypress|Ctl}} is seen) on keyboards which use English abbreviations for key labeling. Abbreviations in the language of the keyboard layout also are in use. e.g. the [[Keyboard layout#Austria and Germany|German layout]] uses {{keypress|Strg}} as required by the German standard [[DIN]] 2137:2012-06. Also, there is a standardized keyboard symbol (to be used when Latin lettering is not preferred), given in [[ISO/IEC 9995]]-7 as symbol 26, and in ISO 7000 ''\u201cGraphical symbols for use on equipment\u201d'' as symbol ISO-7000-2028. This symbol is encoded in [[Unicode]] as U+2388 {{smallcaps|helm symbol}} (\u2388).\n\n== History ==\n\nOn [[teletypewriter]]s and early [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboards]], holding down the Control key while pressing another key zeroed the leftmost two [[bit]]s of the seven bits in the generated [[ASCII]] character.  This allowed the operator to produce the first 32 characters in the ASCII table.  These are non-printing characters that signal the computer to control where the next character will be placed on the [[display device]], eject a printed page or erase the screen, ring the terminal bell, or some other operation.  Aptly, these characters are also called ''[[control character]]s''.\n\nUsing the {{keypress|Ctrl}} key with either lowercase letters (e.g. {{keypress|C}}) or uppercase letters ({{keypress|Shift|C}}) will generate the same ASCII code on a teletypewriter because holding down the control key [[Ground (electricity)|grounds]] (zeros the voltage on) the two wires used to carry the leftmost two bits from the keyboard, ignoring their modification by the {{keypress|\u21e7 Shift}} key.  In modern computers, the interpretation of keypresses is generally left to the [[software]]. Modern keyboards distinguish each physical key from every other and report all keypresses and releases to the controlling software.  This additional flexibility is not often taken advantage of and it usually does not matter, for example, whether the control key is pressed in conjunction with an upper or a lower case character.\n\nWhen the original purpose of the ASCII control characters became either obsolete or seldom used, later software appropriated the Control key combinations for other purposes.\n\n== Location of the key ==\n{{see|Caps lock#Caps lock versus Control key}}\nThe keyboards of many early [[computer terminal]]s, including the [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR and [[Lear-Siegler]] [[ADM-3A]], and early models of the [[IBM PC]], positioned the Control key on the left of the keyboard, whereas '''[[caps lock]]''' resides in the same position on most modern keyboards.  The traditional layout was preserved for later [[workstation]] systems and is often associated with [[Unix]] workstations.  Keyboards from [[Sun Microsystems]] came in two layouts; \"Unix\" and \"PC-style\", with the Unix layout having the traditional placing of the Control key and other keys.<ref>Complex Text Layout Language Support in the Solaris Operating Environment\ndocs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/806-5583/806-5583.pdf</ref> The keyboards produced for [[One Laptop Per Child]] computers also have the Control key in this location.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.linuxworld.com/news/2006/102706-childrens-laptops.html?page=3 | title=Doing it for the kids, man: Children's laptop inspires open source projects | publisher=Linux World | author=Don Marti | date=2006-10-27 | accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref> Other vendors produce keyboards for different computer systems with this placement of the Control key, such as the [[Happy Hacking Keyboard]].\n\nSome users of keyboards with caps lock on the left remap the keys to exchange Control and caps lock, finding the traditional location more ergonomic for using programs benefiting from use of the Control key. Keyboard layout preferences specifically to address this need are available in some operating systems.\n\nOthers leave the control key in the lower-left corner of the keyboard, and press it using the side of their palm.  The choice of location for the control key often comes down to the typist's hand shape and posture.\n\n==Notation==\nThere are several common notations for pressing the Control key in conjunction with another key.  Each notation below means press and hold {{keypress|Ctrl}} while pressing the {{keypress|X}} key:\n\n{| cellspacing=\"8\"\n| <tt>^X</tt>     || Traditional notation\n|-\n| <tt>C-x</tt>    || [[Emacs]] and [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] notation\n|-\n| <tt>CTRL-X</tt> || Old [[Microsoft]] notation\n|-\n| <tt>Ctrl+X</tt> || New Microsoft notation\n|-\n| <tt>Ctrl/X</tt> || [[OpenVMS]] notation\n|-\n| \u2303X || [[Classic Mac OS]] and [[macOS]] notation, used in menus and [[Sticky Keys]] (like the traditional notation, but with {{unichar|2303|up arrowhead}} instead of a [[caret]])<ref>{{cite web|title=OS X Yosemite: What are those symbols shown in menus?|work=Apple Support|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|date=Sep 23, 2015|url=https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18802}}</ref>\n|-\n| Control-X || Classic Mac OS and macOS notation, used in prose<ref>{{cite web|title=Mac keyboard shortcuts|work=Apple Support|publisher=Apple Inc.|date=December 7, 2015|accessdate=December 28, 2015|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236}}</ref>\n|}\n\n== Examples ==\nDifferent application programs, user interfaces, and operating systems use the various control key combinations for different purposes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Key combination\n![[Microsoft Windows]]/[[KDE]]/[[GNOME]]\n![[Unix]] ([[command line]] and programs using [[readline]])\n![[Emacs]] (if different from Unix command line)\n{{anchor|A}}\n|-\n| [[Control-A|{{keypress|Ctrl|A}}]] || Select all || colspan=2 | Beginning of line\n{{anchor|B}}\n|-\n| [[Control-B|{{keypress|Ctrl|B}}]] || Bold || colspan=2 | Backward one character\n{{anchor|C}}\n|-\n| [[Control-C|{{keypress|Ctrl|C}}]] || [[Cut, copy, and paste|Copy]] || Generate [[SIGINT (POSIX)|SIGINT]] (terminate program) || Compound command\n{{anchor|D}}\n|-\n| [[Control-D|{{keypress|Ctrl|D}}]] || Font window (word processing);

the same holds for saving, cutting, and pasting).\n\n[[Macintosh]]es also have a [[Control key (Macintosh)|Control key]], but it has different functionality. The original Apple mouse design reduced complexity by only offering one button. As the interface developed, [[contextual menu|Contextual Menus]] were offered to access extra options. Another button was needed to access these. On Unix and Windows, the user had other mouse buttons to use. On Classic Mac OS and macOS, the Control key is used to invoke a \"right-click\". Apple calls this a \"secondary click\" as left-handers can choose which side this button is on.\n\n* It is mostly used as a [[modifier key]] for key-combinations.\n* When pressing Control and clicking the mouse-button, you will get a [[contextual menu]]. This is a compatibility feature for users with one-button mice; users with two-button mice just use the right mouse-button, with no modifiers.\n* It is used in the [[command line interface]] with programs made for that interface.\n*In Quickbooks, the Control Key is used to validate login credentials during OLSU 1016 and OLSU 1013 errors.  Keeping it depressed while sending information to the Quickbooks servers fixes the errors.\n* Under [[macOS]], the Control key allows the use of [[Emacs]]-style key combinations in most text entry fields. For example, Ctrl-A moves the caret to the start of the paragraph, Ctrl-L vertically centers the current line in the editing field, Ctrl-K cuts text to the end of the line to a [[kill ring]] separate from the normal [[Clipboard (software)|clipboard]], etc.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Alt key]]\n* [[Break key]]\n* [[Control characters]]\n* [[Control-Alt-Delete]]\n* [[Function key]]\n* [[Keyboard layout]]\n* [[Modifier key]]\n\n{{Keyboard}}\n{{keyboard keys}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Control Key}}\n[[Category:Computer keys]]"}]}}}}
