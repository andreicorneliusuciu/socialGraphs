Many are instruments of the [[deflection (physics)|deflection]] type, ordinarily used for measuring low frequencies but capable of being used for frequencies as high as 900&nbsp;Hz. These operate by balancing two opposing forces. Changes in the frequency to be measured cause a change in this balance that can be measured by the deflection of a pointer on a scale. Deflection-type meters are of two types, electrically [[LC circuit|resonant circuits]] and ratiometers.\n\nAn example of a simple electrically resonant circuit is a [[Ammeter#Moving-coil|moving-coil meter]]. In one version, this device has two coils tuned to different frequencies and connected at right angles to one another in such a way that the whole element, with attached pointer, can move. Frequencies in the middle of the meter\u2019s range cause the currents in the two coils to be approximately equal and the pointer to indicate the midpoint of a scale. Changes in frequency cause an imbalance in the currents in the two coils, causing them, and the pointer, to move.\n\nAnother type of frequency meter, not of the deflection type, is the [[Resonance|resonant]] reed type, ordinarily used in ranges from 10 to 1,000&nbsp;Hz, although special designs can operate at lower or higher frequencies.<ref>[http://www.richardsradios.co.uk/freqmeter.html richardsradios.co.uk]</ref> These work by means of tuned steel reeds that vibrate like a [[tuning fork]], under the effect of electric current through a coil; only those reeds that are in resonance vibrate visibly.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/219641/frequency-meter britannica.com]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Frequency counter]]\n* [[Reed receiver]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Electrical meters]]\n[[Category:Electronic test equipment]]\n\n{{Electronics-stub}}"}]}}}}
