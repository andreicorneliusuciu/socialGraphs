Amorphous silicon cells generally feature low efficiency, but are one of the most environmentally friendly [[photovoltaic]] technologies, since they do not use any [[toxic heavy metal]]s such as cadmium or lead.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nAs a second-generation [[thin-film solar cell]] technology, amorphous silicon was once expected to become a major contributor in the [[Growth of photovoltaics|fast-growing]] worldwide photovoltaic market, but has since lost its significance due to strong competition from conventional [[crystalline silicon]] cells and other thin-film technologies such as [[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|CdTe]] and [[CIGS solar cell|CIGS]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nAmorphous silicon differs from other [[allotropic]] variations, such as [[monocrystalline silicon]]\u2014a single crystal, and [[polycrystalline silicon]], that consists of small grains, also known as [[crystallite]]s.\n<!--\n- Redir: Hydrogenated amorphous silicon\n- In addition, amorphous silicon also offers some unique capabilities to a variety of other electronic applications. \n-->\n\n== Description ==\n\nSilicon is a fourfold coordinated atom that is normally [[tetrahedron|tetrahedrally]] bonded to four neighboring silicon atoms. In crystalline silicon (c-Si) this tetrahedral structure continues over a large range, thus forming a well-ordered crystal lattice.\n\nIn amorphous silicon this long range order is not present.  Rather, the atoms form a continuous random network. Moreover, not all the atoms within amorphous silicon are fourfold coordinated. Due to the disordered nature of the material some atoms have a [[dangling bond]].  Physically, these dangling bonds represent defects in the continuous random network and may cause anomalous electrical behavior.\n\nThe material can be [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivated]] by hydrogen, which bonds to the dangling bonds and can reduce the dangling bond density by several orders of magnitude. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) has a sufficiently low amount of defects to be used within devices such as solar [[photovoltaic]] cells, particularly in the [[protocrystalline]] growth regime.<ref>R.W.

Introduction of carbon atoms adds extra degrees of freedom for control of the properties of the material. The film could also be made [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] to visible light.\n\nIncreasing concentrations of carbon in the alloy widen the electronic gap between conduction and valence bands (also called \"optical gap\" and [[bandgap]]).  This can potentially increase the light efficiency of solar cells made with amorphous silicon carbide layers. On the other hand, the electronic properties as a [[semiconductor]] (mainly [[electron mobility]]), are adversely affected by the increasing content of carbon in the alloy, due to the increased disorder in the atomic network.\n\nSeveral studies are found in the scientific literature, mainly investigating the effects of deposition parameters on electronic quality, but practical applications of amorphous silicon carbide in commercial devices are still lacking.\n\n== Properties ==\nThe density of amorphous Si has been calculated as 4.90\u00d710<sup>22</sup> atom/cm<sup>3</sup> (2.285 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) at 300 K. This was done using thin (5 micron) strips of amorphous silicon. This density is 1.8\u00b10.1% less dense than crystalline Si at 300 K.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Custer|first=J.

By introducing hydrogen during the fabrication of amorphous silicon, photoconductivity is significantly improved and doping is made possible. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon, a-Si:H, was first fabricated in 1969 by Chittick, Alexander and Sterling by deposition using a silane gas (SiH4) precursor. The resulting material showed a lower defect density and increased conductivity due to impurities. Interest in a-Si:H came when (in 1975), LeComber and Spear discovered the ability for substitutional doping of a-Si:H using phosphine (n-type) or diborane (p-type).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zQMwsMt4VmoC|title=Hydrogenated Amorphous Silicon|last=Street|first=R.

For example, a-Si layers can be made thinner than c-Si, which may produce savings on silicon material cost.\n\nOne further advantage is that a-Si can be deposited at very low temperatures, e.g., as low as 75 degrees Celsius. This allows deposition on not only glass, but [[plastic electronics|plastic]] as well, making it a candidate for a [[roll-to-roll processing]] technique. Once deposited, a-Si can be [[doped]] in a fashion similar to c-Si, to form [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] or [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] layers and ultimately to form electronic devices.\n\nAnother advantage is that a-Si can be deposited over large areas by [[plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition|PECVD]].

Here their lower inherent efficiency is made up, at least partially, by their thinness \u2013 higher efficiencies can be reached by stacking several thin-film cells on top of each other, each one tuned to work well at a specific frequency of light. This approach is not applicable to c-Si cells, which are thick as a result of their construction technique and are therefore largely opaque, blocking light from reaching other layers in a stack.\n\nThe source of the low efficiency of amorphous silicon photovoltaics is due largely to the low [[hole mobility]] of the material.<ref name=\"LiangSchiff2006\">{{cite journal|last1=Liang|first1=Jianjun|last2=Schiff|first2=E.

The placement of the p-type layer on top is also due to the lower hole mobility, allowing the holes to traverse a shorter average distance for collection to the top contact.

Uni-Solar, a division of [[Energy Conversion Devices]] produced a version of flexible backings, used in roll-on roofing products.
