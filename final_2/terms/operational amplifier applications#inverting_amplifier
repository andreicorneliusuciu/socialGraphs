This article illustrates some typical applications of [[operational amplifier]]s. A real op amp has a number of non-ideal features as shown in the diagram, but here a simplified schematic notation is used, and the reader is reminded that many details such as device selection and power supply connections are not shown. Operational amplifiers are optimised for use with negative feedback, and this article discusses only negative-feedback applications. When positive feedback is required, a [[comparator]] is usually more appropriate. See [[Comparator applications]] for further information.\n\n== Practical considerations ==\n\n=== Operational amplifiers parameter requirements ===\nIn order for a particular device to be used in an application, it must satisfy certain requirements. The operational amplifier must\n* have large open-loop signal gain (voltage gain of 200,000 is obtained in early integrated circuit exemplars), and\n* have input impedance large with respect to values present in the feedback network.\nWith these requirements satisfied, the op amp is considered [[Operational amplifier#Ideal op-amps|ideal]], and one can use the method of [[virtual ground]] to quickly and intuitively grasp the 'behavior' of any of the op amp circuits below.\n\n=== Component specification ===\nResistors used in practical solid-state op-amp circuits are typically in the k\u03a9 range. Resistors much greater than 1 M\u03a9 cause excessive [[thermal noise]] and make the circuit operation susceptible to significant errors due to bias or leakage currents.\n\n=== Input bias currents and input offset ===\nPractical operational amplifiers draw a small current from each of their inputs due to bias requirements (in the case of bipolar junction transistor-based inputs) or leakage (in the case of MOSFET-based inputs).\n\nThese currents flow through the resistances connected to the inputs and produce small voltage drops across those resistances. Appropriate design of the feedback network can alleviate problems associated with input bias currents and common-mode gain, as explained below. The heuristic rule is to ensure that the impedance \"looking out\" of each input terminal is identical.\n\nTo the extent that the input bias currents do not match, there will be an effective [[input offset voltage]] present, which can lead to problems in circuit performance. Many commercial op amp offerings provide a method for tuning the operational amplifier to balance the inputs (e.g., \"offset null\" or \"balance\" pins that can interact with an external voltage source attached to a potentiometer). Alternatively, a tunable external voltage can be added to one of the inputs in order to balance out the offset effect. In cases where a design calls for one input to be short-circuited to ground, that short circuit can be replaced with a variable resistance that can be tuned to mitigate the offset problem.\n\nOperational amplifiers using [[MOSFET]]-based input stages have input leakage currents that will be, in many designs, negligible.\n\n===Power supply effects===\n\nAlthough power supplies are not indicated in the (simplified) operational amplifier designs below, they are nonetheless present and can be critical in operational amplifier circuit design.\n\n==== Supply noise ====\nPower supply imperfections (e.g., power signal ripple, non-zero source impedance) may lead to noticeable deviations from ideal operational amplifier behavior. For example, operational amplifiers have a specified [[power supply rejection ratio]] that indicates how well the output can reject signals that appear on the power supply inputs. Power supply inputs are often noisy in large designs because the power supply is used by nearly every component in the design, and inductance effects prevent current from being instantaneously delivered to every component at once. As a consequence, when a component requires large injections of current (e.g., a digital component that is frequently switching from one state to another), nearby components can experience sagging at their connection to the power supply. This problem can be mitigated with appropriate use of [[decoupling capacitor|bypass capacitor]]s connected across each power supply pin and ground. When bursts of current are required by a component, the component can ''bypass'' the power supply by receiving the current directly from the nearby capacitor (which is then slowly recharged by the power supply).\n\n==== Using power supply currents in the signal path ====\nAdditionally, current drawn into the operational amplifier from the power supply can be used as inputs to external circuitry that augment the capabilities of the operational amplifier. For example, an operational amplifier may not be fit for a particular high-gain application because its output would be required to generate signals outside of the safe range generated by the amplifier. In this case, an external [[push&ndash;pull output|push&ndash;pull amplifier]] can be controlled by the current into and out of the operational amplifier. Thus, the operational amplifier may itself operate within its factory specified bounds while still allowing the negative feedback path to include a large output signal well outside of those bounds.<ref>Paul Horowitz and Winfield Hill, ''[[The Art of Electronics]]''. 2nd ed.

''V''<sub>in</sub> is at a length ''R''<sub>1</sub> from the fulcrum; ''V''<sub>out</sub> is at a length ''R''<sub>2</sub> further along.

Consequently, the system may be [[BIBO stability|unstable]] when connected to sufficiently capacitive loads. In these cases, a [[frequency compensation|lag compensation]] network (e.g., connecting the load to the voltage follower through a resistor) can be used to restore stability. The manufacturer [[data sheet]] for the operational amplifier may provide guidance for the selection of components in external compensation networks.

The high input impedance and gain of an op-amp allow straightforward calculation of element values, allowing accurate implementation of any desired filter topology with little concern for the loading effects of stages in the filter or of subsequent stages. However, the frequencies at which active filters can be implemented is limited; when the behavior of the amplifiers departs significantly from the ideal behavior assumed in elementary design of the filters, filter performance is degraded.\n\n==Comparator==\n:[[File:Op-Amp Comparator.svg|200px]]\n\n{{main|Comparator}}\n{{main|Comparator applications}}\n\nAn operational amplifier can, if necessary, be forced to act as a comparator. The smallest difference between the input voltages will be amplified enormously, causing the output to swing to nearly the supply voltage. However, it is usually better to use a dedicated comparator for this purpose, as its output has a higher slew rate and can reach either power supply rail. Some op-amps have clamping diodes on the input that prevent use as a comparator.<ref>http://e2e.ti.com/blogs_/archives/b/thesignal/archive/2012/03/14/op-amps-used-as-comparators-is-it-okay.aspx</ref>\n\n==Integration and differentiation==\n\n=== Inverting integrator ===\n\n{{main|Op amp integrator}}\nThe integrator is mostly used in [[analog computer]]s, [[analog-to-digital converter]]s and wave-shaping circuits.\n\n[[File:Op-Amp Integrating Amplifier.svg|300px]]\n\n[[Integral|Integrates]] (and inverts) the input signal ''V''<sub>in</sub>(''t'') over a time interval ''t'', ''t''<sub>0</sub> < ''t'' < ''t''<sub>1</sub>, yielding an output voltage at time ''t'' = ''t''<sub>1</sub> of\n:<math>V_{\\text{out}}(t_1) = V_{\\text{out}}(t_0) - \\frac{ 1 }{RC} \\int_{t_0}^{t_1}V_{\\text{in}}(t)\\, \\operatorname{d}t </math>\nwhere ''V''<sub>out</sub>(''t''<sub>0</sub>) represents the output voltage of the circuit at time ''t'' = ''t''<sub>0</sub>.

It is a filter with a single [[complex zero|zero]] at DC (i.e., where [[angular frequency]] <math>\\omega = 0</math>&nbsp;radians) and gain. The high-pass characteristics of a differentiating amplifier (i.e., the low-frequency zero) can lead to stability challenges when the circuit is used in an analog servo loop (e.g., in a [[PID controller]] with a significant derivative gain).
