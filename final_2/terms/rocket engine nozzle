The nozzle ''turns the static high pressure high temperature gas into rapidly moving gas'' at near-ambient pressure.  \n\n==History==\n\nThe de Laval nozzle was originally developed in the 19th century by [[Gustaf de Laval]] for use in [[steam turbine]]s. It was first used in an early rocket engine developed by [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]], one of the fathers of modern rocketry. It has since been used in almost all rocket engines, including [[Walter Theill]]'s implementation, which made possible Germany's [[V-2]] rocket.\n\n==Atmospheric use==\n\nThe optimal size of a rocket engine nozzle to be used within the atmosphere is achieved when the exit pressure equals ambient (atmospheric) pressure, which decreases with altitude. For rockets travelling from the Earth to orbit, a simple nozzle design is only optimal at one altitude, losing efficiency and wasting fuel at other altitudes.\n\nJust past the throat, the pressure of the gas is higher than ambient pressure and needs to be lowered between the throat and the nozzle exit by expansion. If the pressure of the jet leaving the nozzle exit is still above ambient pressure, then a nozzle is said to be \"underexpanded\"; if the jet is below ambient pressure, then it is \"overexpanded\".\n\nSlight overexpansion causes a slight reduction in efficiency, but otherwise does little harm. However, if the exit pressure is less than approximately 40% that of ambient, then \"flow separation\" occurs. This can cause jet instabilities that can cause damage to the nozzle or simply cause control difficulties of the vehicle or the engine.\n\nIn some cases it is desirable for reliability and safety reasons to ignite a rocket engine on the ground that will be used all the way to orbit. For optimal [[Takeoff|liftoff]] performance, the pressure of the gases exiting nozzle should be at sea-level pressure; however, if a rocket engine is primarily designed for use at high altitudes and is only providing additional thrust to another \"first-stage\" engine during liftoff in a [[multi-stage]] design, then designers will usually opt for an overexpanded nozzle (at sea-level) design, making it more efficient at higher altitudes, where the ambient pressure is lower. This was the technique employed on the [[Space shuttle]]'s [[SSME|main engines]], which spent most of their powered trajectory in near-vacuum, while the shuttle's two [[solid rocket booster]]s provided the majority of the liftoff thrust.\n\n==Vacuum use==\n\nFor nozzles that are used in vacuum or at very high altitude, it is impossible to match ambient pressure; rather, nozzles with larger area ratio are usually more efficient. However, a very long nozzle has significant mass, a drawback in and of itself. A length that optimises overall vehicle performance typically has to be found. Additionally, as the temperature of the gas in the nozzle decreases, some components of the exhaust gases (such as water vapour from the combustion process) may condense or even freeze. This is highly undesirable and needs to be avoided.\n\n[[Magnetic nozzle]]s have been proposed for some types of propulsion (for example [[VASIMR]]), in which the flow of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] or ions are directed by [[magnetic field]]s instead of walls made of solid materials. These can be advantageous, since a magnetic field itself cannot melt, and the plasma temperatures can reach millions of [[kelvin]]s. However, there are often thermal design challenges presented by the coils themselves, particularly if superconducting coils are used to form the throat and expansion fields.\n\n==One-dimensional analysis of gas flow in rocket engine nozzles==\n[[File:Nozzle de Laval diagram.svg|right|thumb|250px|Diagram of a de Laval nozzle, showing flow velocity (v) increasing in the direction of flow, with decreases in temperature (t) and pressure (p). The Mach number (M) increases from subsonic, to sonic at the throat, to supersonic.]]\n\n{{main|De Laval nozzle}}\n\nThe analysis of gas flow through de Laval nozzles involves a number of concepts and simplifying assumptions:\n\n* The combustion gas is assumed to be an [[ideal gas]].\n* The gas flow is [[isentropic]] i.e., at constant [[entropy]], as the result of the assumption of non-viscous fluid, and [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]] process.\n* The gas flow is constant (i.e., steady) during the period of the [[propellant]] burn.\n* The gas flow is non-turbulent and axisymmetric from gas inlet to exhaust gas exit (i.e., along the nozzle's axis of symmetry)\n* The flow behavior is [[compressible flow|compressible]] since the fluid is a gas.\n\nAs the combustion gas enters the rocket nozzle, it is traveling at [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] velocities. As the throat constricts, the gas is forced to accelerate until at the nozzle throat, where the cross-sectional area is the least, the linear velocity becomes [[mach number|sonic]]. From the throat the cross-sectional area then increases, the gas expands and the linear velocity becomes progressively more [[supersonic]].\n\nThe linear velocity of the exiting exhaust gases can be calculated using the following equation <ref name=Nakka>[http://www.nakka-rocketry.net/th_nozz.html Richard Nakka's Equation 12]</ref><ref name=Braeuning>[http://www.braeunig.us/space/propuls.htm#intro Robert Braeuning's Equation 2.22]</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Sutton, George P.|title=Rocket Propulsion Elements: An Introduction to the Engineering of Rockets|edition=6th|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|year=1992|isbn=0-471-52938-9|page=636}}</ref>\n\n:<math>v_e = \\sqrt{\\;\\frac{T\\;R}{M}\\cdot\\frac{2\\;\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}\\cdot\\bigg[ 1-(p_e/p)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}\\bigg]} </math>\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|align=right|where:\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n!align=right|<math>v_e</math>\n|align=left|=&nbsp; Exhaust velocity at nozzle exit, m/s\n|-\n!align=right|<math>T</math>\n|align=left|=&nbsp; absolute [[temperature]] of inlet gas, K\n|-\n!align=right|<math>R</math>\n|align=left|=&nbsp; [[gas constant|Universal gas law constant]] = 8314.5 J/(kmol\u00b7K) \n|-\n!align=right|<math>M</math>\n|align=left|=&nbsp; the gas [[molecular mass]], kg/kmol&nbsp; &nbsp; (also known as the molecular weight)\n|-\n!align=right|<math>\\gamma</math>\n|align=left|=&nbsp; <math>c_p/c_v</math> = [[adiabatic index|isentropic expansion factor]]\n|-\n!align=right|<math>c_p</math>\n|align=left|=&nbsp; [[specific heat capacity|specific heat]] of the gas at constant pressure\n|-\n!align=right|<math>c_v</math> \n|align=left|=&nbsp; specific heat of the gas at constant volume\n|-\n!align=right|<math>p_e</math> \n|align=left|=&nbsp; [[pressure|absolute pressure]] of exhaust gas at nozzle exit, [[pascal (unit)|Pa]]\n|-\n!align=right|<math>p</math>\n|align=left|=&nbsp; absolute pressure of inlet gas, Pa\n|}\n\nSome typical values of the exhaust gas velocity ''v<sub>e</sub>'' for rocket engines burning various propellants are:\n\n* 1.7 to 2.9&nbsp;km/s (3800 to 6500&nbsp;mi/h) for liquid [[monopropellant]]s\n* 2.9 to 4.5&nbsp;km/s (6500 to 10100&nbsp;mi/h) for liquid [[bipropellant]]s\n* 2.1 to 3.2&nbsp;km/s (4700 to 7200&nbsp;mi/h) for [[solid rocket|solid propellant]]s\n\nAs a note of interest, '''''v<sub>e</sub>''''' is sometimes referred to as the ''ideal exhaust gas velocity'' because it based on the assumption that the exhaust gas behaves as an ideal gas.\n\nAs an example calculation using the above equation, assume that the  propellant combustion gases are: at an absolute pressure entering the nozzle of '''''p'''''&nbsp;= 7.0 MPa and exit the rocket exhaust at an absolute pressure of '''''p<sub>e</sub>''''' = 0.1 MPa; at an absolute temperature of '''''T''''' = 3500 K; with an isentropic expansion factor of '''''\u03b3''''' = 1.22 and a molar mass of '''''M'''''&nbsp;= 22&nbsp;kg/kmol. Using those values in the above equation yields an exhaust velocity '''''v<sub>e</sub>''''' = 2802&nbsp;m/s or 2.80&nbsp;km/s which is consistent with above typical values.\n\nThe technical literature can be very confusing because many authors fail to explain whether they are using the universal gas law constant '''''R''''' which applies to any [[ideal gas]] or whether they are using the gas law constant '''''R<sub>s</sub>''''' which only applies to a specific individual gas.  The relationship between the two constants is '''''R<sub>s</sub>''''' = '''''R/M'''''.\n\n==Specific impulse==\n\n[[Thrust]] is the force that moves a rocket through the air or space. Thrust is generated by the [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] system of the rocket through the application of Newton's third law of motion: \"For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction\".  A gas or working fluid is accelerated out the rear of the rocket engine nozzle, and the rocket is accelerated in the opposite direction.

Therefore, for supersonic nozzles, it is actually possible for the pressure of the gas exiting the nozzle to be significantly below or very greatly above ambient pressure.\n\nIf the exit pressure is too low, then the jet can separate from the nozzle. This is often unstable, and the jet will generally cause large off-axis thrusts and may mechanically damage the nozzle.\n\nThis separation generally occurs if the exit pressure drops below roughly 30\u201345% of ambient, but separation may be delayed to far lower pressures if the nozzle is designed to increase the pressure at the rim, as is achieved with the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|SSME]] (1\u20132 psi at 15 psi ambient).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.k-makris.gr/RocketTechnology/Nozzle_Design/nozzle_design.htm|title=Nozzle Design|accessdate=November 23, 2011|date=March 16, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, as the rocket engine starts up or throttles, the chamber pressure varies, and this generates different levels of efficiency. At low chamber pressures the engine is almost inevitably going to be grossly over-expanded.\n\n==Optimal shape==\n\nThe ratio of the area of the narrowest part of the nozzle to the exit plane area is mainly what determines how efficiently the expansion of the exhaust gases is converted into linear velocity, the exhaust velocity, and therefore the [[thrust]] of the rocket engine. The gas properties have an effect as well.\n\nThe shape of the nozzle also modestly affects how efficiently the expansion of the exhaust gases is converted into linear motion. The simplest nozzle shape has a ~12\u00b0 cone half-angle, which is about 97% efficient. Smaller angles give very slightly higher efficiency, larger angles give lower efficiency.\n\nMore complex shapes of revolution are frequently used, such as [[Bell nozzle]]s or parabolic shapes. These give perhaps 1% higher efficiency than the cone nozzle and can be shorter and lighter. They are widely used on launch vehicles and other rockets where weight is at a premium. They are, of course, harder to fabricate, so are typically more costly.\n\nThere is also a theoretically optimal nozzle shape for maximal exhaust speed. However, a shorter bell shape is typically used, which gives better overall performance due to its much lower weight, shorter length, lower drag losses, and only very marginally lower exhaust speed.<ref name=\"nozzledesign\">[http://www.engineeringatboeing.com/articles/nozzledesign.htm PWR Engineering: Nozzle Design]</ref>\n\nOther design aspects affect the efficiency of a rocket nozzle. The nozzle's throat should have a smooth radius. The internal angle that narrows to the throat also has an effect on the overall efficiency, but this is small. The exit angle of the nozzle needs to be as small as possible (about 12\u00b0) in order to minimize the chances of separation problems at low exit pressures.\n\n==Advanced designs==\nA number of more sophisticated designs have been proposed for [[altitude compensating nozzle|altitude compensation]] and other uses.\n\nNozzles with an atmospheric boundary include:\n*[[Expansion deflection nozzle|expansion-deflection nozzle]],<ref name=\"Sutton\"/>\n*[[plug nozzle]],\n*[[aerospike engine|aerospike]],<ref name=\"Sutton\">{{cite book|author=Sutton, George P.|title=Rocket Propulsion Elements: An Introduction to the Engineering of Rockets|edition=7th|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|year=2001|isbn=0-471-32642-9}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=LQbDOxg3XZcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=rocket+propulsion&ei=wlEhScL4EYywkwSVv5SCDw#PPA84,M1-- p. 84]</ref><ref>[http://pdf.aiaa.org/jaPreview/JPP/1998/PVJAIMP5354.pdf Journal of Propulsion and Power Vol.14 No.5, \"Advanced Rocket Nozzles\", Hagemann et al.]</ref>\n*Single Expansion Ramp Nozzle ([[SERN]]), a linear expansion nozzle, where the gas pressure transfers work only on one side and which could be described as a single-sided aerospike nozzle.\nEach of these allows the supersonic flow to adapt to the ambient pressure by expanding or contracting, thereby changing the exit ratio so that it is at (or near) optimal exit pressure for the corresponding altitude. The plug and aerospike nozzles are very similar in that they are radial in-flow designs but plug nozzles feature a solid centerbody (sometimes truncated) and aerospike nozzles have a \"base-bleed\" of gases to simulate a solid center-body. ED nozzles are radial out-flow nozzles with the flow deflected by a center pintle.\n\nControlled flow-separation nozzles include:\n*[[expanding nozzle]],\n*bell nozzles with a removable insert,\n*[[Stepped nozzles]], or dual-bell nozzles.<ref>[http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406&gTable=japaperimport&gID=5905 Journal of Propulsion and Power Vol.18 No.1, \"Experimental and Analytical Design Verification of the Dual-Bell Concept\", Hagemann et al.]</ref>\nThese are generally very similar to bell nozzles but include an insert or mechanism by which the exit area ratio can be increased as ambient pressure is reduced.\n\nDual-mode nozzles include:\n*dual-expander nozzle,\n*dual-throat nozzle.\nThese have either two throats or two thrust chambers (with corresponding throats). The central throat is of a standard design and is surrounded by an annular throat, which exhausts gases from the same (dual-throat) or a separate (dual-expander) thrust chamber. Both throats would, in either case, discharge into a bell nozzle. At higher altitudes, where the ambient pressure is lower, the central nozzle would be shut off, reducing the throat area and thereby increasing the nozzle area ratio. These designs require additional complexity, but an advantage of having two thrust chambers is that they can be configured to burn different propellants or different fuel mixture ratios. Similarly, Aerojet has also designed a nozzle called the \"Thrust Augmented Nozzle\",<ref name=\"Thrust Augmented Nozzle\">[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V1N-4K427MV-2&_user=121739&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000010018&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=121739&md5=dfdf8a69755f6b8d29a842f0447ce8b0 Thrust Augmented Nozzle]</ref><ref name=\"TAN\">[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA454615 THRUST AUGMENTED NOZZLE (TAN) the New Paradigm for Booster Rockets]</ref> which injects propellant and oxidiser directly into the nozzle section for combustion, allowing larger area ratio nozzles to be used deeper in an atmosphere than they would without augmentation due to effects of flow separation. They would again allow multiple propellants to be used (such as RP-1), further increasing thrust.\n\nLiquid injection thrust vectoring nozzles are another advanced design that allow pitch and yaw control from un-gimbaled nozzles. India's [[PSLV]] calls its design \"Secondary Injection Thrust Vector Control System\"; strontium perchlorate is injected through various fluid paths in the nozzle to achieve the desired control. Some ICBMs and boosters, such as the [[Titan IIIC]] and [[Minuteman II]], use similar designs.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Choked flow]] \u2013 when a gas velocity reaches the speed of sound in the gas as it flows through a restriction\n*[[De Laval nozzle]] \u2013 a convergent-divergent nozzle designed to produce supersonic speeds\n*[[Dual-thrust]] rocket motors\n*[[Giovanni Battista Venturi]]\n*[[Jet engine]] \u2013 engines propelled by jets (including rockets)\n*[[Multistage rocket]]\n*[[NK-33]] \u2013 Russian rocket engine\n*[[Pulse jet engine]]\n*[[Pulsed rocket motor]]\n*[[Reaction Engines Skylon]] \u2013 a single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane powered by hybrid air-breathing/internal-oxygen engine ([[Reaction Engines SABRE]])\n*[[Rocket]] \u2013 rocket vehicles\n*[[Rocket engines]] \u2013 used to propel rocket vehicles\n*[[SERN|SERN, Single-expansion ramp nozzle]] \u2013 a non-axisymmetric aerospike\n*[[Shock diamond]]s \u2013 the visible bands formed in the exhaust of rocket engines\n*[[Solid-fuel rocket]]\n*[[Spacecraft propulsion]]\n*[[Specific impulse]] \u2013 a measure of exhaust speed\n*[[Staged combustion cycle (rocket)]] \u2013 a type of rocket engine\n*[[Venturi effect]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.rocketsupplycompany.com Amateur and Experimental Rocketry]\n* [http://www.nasa.gov/home/index.htm NASA web site]\n* [http://trs.nis.nasa.gov/archive/00000186/01/sp8120.pdf NASA Space Vehicle Design Criteria, Liquid Rocket Engine Nozzles]\n* [http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/ NASA's \"Beginners' Guide to Rockets\"]\n* [http://www.aerospaceweb.org/design/aerospike/main.shtml The Aerospike Engine]\n* [http://www.nakka-rocketry.net/ Richard Nakka's Experimental Rocketry Web Site]\n* [http://www.braeunig.us/space/propuls.htm#intro \"Rocket Propulsion\" on Robert Braeuning's Web Site]\n* [http://software.lpre.de Free Design Tool for Liquid Rocket Engine Thermodynamic Analysis]\n\n<br>{{Machine configurations|state=uncollapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Nozzles]]\n[[Category:Rocketry]]\n[[Category:Rocket propulsion]]\n[[Category:Pyrotechnics]]"}]}}}}
