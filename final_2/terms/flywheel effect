This is usually caused by interacting [[inductor|inductive]] and [[capacitor|capacitive]] elements in the oscillator. Circuits undergoing such oscillations are said to be '''flywheeling'''.\n\nThe flywheel effect may be desirable, such as in [[phase (waves)|phase]]-locked loops used in [[Synchronization|synchronous]] systems, or undesirable, such as in voltage-controlled oscillators.\n\nFlywheel effect is used in '''class C''' modulation where efficiency of modulation can be achieved as high as 90%.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Thermal flywheel effect]]\n\n==References==\n{{FS1037C MS188}}\n\n[[Category:Oscillators]]"}]}}}}
