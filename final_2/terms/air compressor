By one of several methods, an air compressor forces more and more air into a storage tank, increasing the pressure. When tank pressure reaches its upper limit the air compressor shuts off. The compressed air, then, is held in the tank until called into use.  The energy contained in the compressed air can be used for a variety of applications, utilizing the kinetic energy of the air as it is released and the tank depressurizes. When tank pressure reaches its lower limit, the air compressor turns on again and re-pressurizes the tank. \n\n\n\n==According to the design and principle of operation==\n\n# [[Rotary-screw compressor]]\n# [[Turbo compressor]]\n\n==Displacement type==\n\nThere are numerous methods of air compression, divided into either positive-displacement or roto-dynamic types.<ref name=\"PM\">{{cite web|last=Klenck|first=Thomas|title=How it Works: Air Compressor|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/improvement/energy-efficient/1275131|publisher=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=30 July 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/products/reference/14970 Compressor types: rotary screw, reciprocating, and vane compressors]</ref>\n\n===Positive displacement===\n\nPositive-displacement compressors work by forcing air into a chamber whose volume is decreased to compress the air. Common types of positive displacement compressors are:-\n* Piston-type: air compressors use this principle by pumping air into an air chamber through the use of the constant motion of pistons. They use one-way valves to guide air into a cylinder chamber, where the air is compressed.<ref name=PM/>\n* Rotary screw compressors: use positive-displacement compression by matching two helical screws that, when turned, guide air into a chamber, whose volume is decreased as the screws turn.\n* Vane compressors: use a slotted rotor with varied blade placement to guide air into a chamber and compress the volume. A type of compressor that delivers a fixed volume of air at high pressures.\n\n=== Dynamic Displacement ===\n\nDynamic displacement air compressors include [[centrifugal compressor]]s and axial compressors. In these types, a rotating component imparts its kinetic energy to the air which is eventually converted into pressure energy. These use centrifugal force generated by a spinning impeller to accelerate and then decelerate captured air, which pressurizes it. <ref name=PM />\n\n== Cooling ==\nDue to [[Adiabatic heating#Adiabatic heating and cooling|adiabatic heating]], air compressors require some method of disposing of waste heat.  Generally this is some form of air- or water-cooling, although some (particularly rotary type) compressors may be cooled by oil (that is then in turn air- or water-cooled)<ref>http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/air-compressor-types-d_441.html</ref> and the atmospheric changes also considered during cooling of compressors.\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:CompAir Fahrbarer Kompressor Typ C38.jpg|thumb|Portable air compressor for powering tools, such as [[jackhammer]]s]]\nAir compressors have many uses, including:\nsupplying high-pressure clean air to fill [[gas cylinder]]s,\nsupplying moderate-pressure clean air to a submerged [[surface supplied diving|surface supplied diver]],\nsupplying moderate-pressure clean air for driving some office and school building [[pneumatic]] [[HVAC control system]] valves,\nsupplying a large amount of moderate-pressure air to power [[pneumatic tool]]s, such as [[jackhammer]]s,\nfor filling [[tire]]s,\nand to produce large volumes of moderate-pressure air for large-scale industrial processes (such as oxidation for petroleum coking or cement plant bag house purge systems).\n\nMost air compressors either are reciprocating piston type, rotary vane or [[rotary screw compressor|rotary screw]]. [[Centrifugal compressors]] are common in very large applications. There are two main types of air compressor's pumps: oil-lubed and oil-less. The oil-less system has more technical development, but is more expensive, louder and lasts for less time than oil-lubed pumps. The oil-less system also delivers air of better quality.\n\nThe most common types of air compressors are: electric or gas/diesel powered compressors. The power of a compressor is measured in HP ([[Horsepower]]) and CFM ([[cubic foot|cubic feet of air per minute]]). The gallon size of the tank tells you how much compressed air \"in reserve\" is available. Gas/diesel powered compressors are widely used in remote areas with problematic access to electricity. They are noisy and require ventilation for exhaust gases. Electric powered compressors are widely used in production, workshops and garages with permanent access to electricity. Common workshop/garage compressors are 110-120 Volt or 230-240 Volt. Compressor tank shapes are: \"pancake\", \"twin tank\", \"horizontal\", and \"vertical\". Depending on a size and purpose compressors can be stationary or portable.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Free-piston engine]]\n* [[Gas compressor]]\n* [[Pneumatics]]\n* [[Gas cylinder]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Gas compressors]]\n[[Category:Gases]]\n[[Category:Diving support equipment]]\n[[Category:Underwater work]]\n[[Category:Gas technologies]]\n[[Category:Industrial gases]]"}]}}}}
