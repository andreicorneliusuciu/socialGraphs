FETs are also known as '''unipolar transistors''' and as they involve single-carrier-type operation.\nThe FET has several forms, but all have high input [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]. While the conductivity of a non-FET transistor is regulated by the input current (the emitter to base current) and so has a low input impedance, a FET's conductivity is regulated by a voltage applied to a terminal (the gate) which is insulated from the device. The applied [[gate voltage]] imposes an electric field into the device, which in turn attracts or repels charge carriers to or from the region between a source terminal and a drain terminal. The density of charge carriers in turn influences the conductivity between the source and drain.\n\n== History ==\n\n{{Main article|History of the transistor}}\n\nThe field-effect transistor was first patented by [[Julius Edgar Lilienfeld]] in 1926 and by [[Oskar Heil]] in 1934, but practical semiconducting devices (the [[JFET]]) were developed only much later after the [[transistor]] effect was observed and explained by the team of [[William Shockley]] at [[Bell Labs]] in 1947, immediately after the 20-year patent period eventually expired. The [[MOSFET]], which largely superseded the JFET and had a profound effect on digital electronic development, was invented by [[Dawon Kahng]] and Martin Atalla in 1959.<ref>[http://www.computerhistory.org/semiconductor/timeline/1960-MOS.html 1960 - Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) Transistor Demonstrated - The Silicon Engine | Computer History Museum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n== Basic information ==\n{{see also|Charge carrier#Majority and minority carriers}}\nFETs can be majority-charge-carrier devices, in which the current is carried predominantly by majority carriers, or minority-charge-carrier devices, in which the current is mainly due to a flow of minority carriers.<ref name=millman2>{{cite book | \nauthor = [[Jacob Millman]] | title = Electronic devices and circuits | year = 1985\n | page = 397 | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill International]]\n| location = Singapore | isbn=0-07-085505-6}}</ref> The device consists of an active channel through which charge carriers, electrons or [[Electron hole|holes]], flow from the source to the drain.

Conventionally, current entering the channel at D is designated by I<sub>D</sub>. Drain-to-source voltage is V<sub>DS</sub>.\n* Gate (G), the terminal that modulates the channel conductivity.  By applying voltage to G, one can control I<sub>D</sub>.\n\n== More about terminals ==\n[[File:Lateral mosfet.svg|thumbnail|Cross section of an n-type MOSFET]]\n\nAll FETs have ''source'', ''drain'', and ''gate'' terminals that correspond roughly to the ''emitter'', ''collector'', and ''base'' of [[bipolar junction transistor|BJT]]s. Most FETs have a fourth terminal called the ''body'', ''base'', ''bulk'', or ''[[substrate (electronics)|substrate]].'' This fourth terminal serves to [[biasing (electronics)|bias]] the transistor into operation; it is rare to make non-trivial use of the body terminal in circuit designs, but its presence is important when setting up the [[integrated circuit layout|physical layout]] of an [[integrated circuit]]. The size of the gate,  length ''L'' in the diagram, is the distance between source and drain. The ''width'' is the extension of the transistor, in the direction perpendicular to the cross section in the diagram (i.e., into/out of the screen). Typically the width is much larger than the length of the gate. A gate length of 1&nbsp;\u00b5m limits the upper frequency to about 5&nbsp;GHz, 0.2&nbsp;\u00b5m to about 30&nbsp;GHz.\n\nThe names of the terminals refer to their functions. The gate terminal may be thought of as controlling the opening and closing of a physical gate. This gate permits electrons to flow through or blocks their passage by creating or eliminating a channel between the source and drain. Electron-flow from the source terminal towards the drain terminal is influenced by an applied voltage. The body simply refers to the bulk of the semiconductor in which the gate, source and drain lie. Usually the body terminal is connected to the highest or lowest voltage within the circuit, depending on the type of the FET. The body terminal and the source terminal are sometimes connected together since the source is often connected to the highest or lowest voltage within the circuit, although there are several uses of FETs which do not have such a configuration, such as transmission gates and [[cascode]] circuits.\n\n\n=== Effect of gate voltage on current ===\n[[File:JFET n-channel en.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|I\u2013V characteristics and output plot of a JFET n-channel transistor.]]\n\n[[File:Threshold formation nowatermark.gif|thumb|right|400px|Simulation result for Right side: formation of [[inversion]] channel (electron density) and Left side: current-gate voltage curve(transfer characteristics) in a n-channel [[nanowire]] [[MOSFET]]. Note that the [[threshold voltage]] for this device lies around 0.45&nbsp;V.]]\n[[File:FET-Typen (mit Schaltbildern).svg|thumb|upright=1.3|FET conventional symbol types]]\n\nThe FET controls the flow of [[electron]]s (or [[electron hole]]s) from the source to drain by affecting the size and shape of a \"conductive channel\" created and influenced by voltage (or lack of voltage) applied across the gate and source terminals. (For simplicity, this discussion assumes that the body and source are connected.) This conductive channel is the \"stream\" through which electrons flow from source to drain.\n\n====n-channel====\nIn an n-channel ''depletion-mode'' device, a negative gate-to-source voltage causes a ''[[Depletion zone|depletion region]]'' to expand in width and encroach on the channel from the sides, narrowing the channel. If the active region expands to completely close the channel, the resistance of the channel from source to drain becomes large, and the FET is effectively turned off like a switch (see right figure, when there is very small current). This is called ''pinch-off,'' and the voltage at which it occurs is called the ''pinch-off voltage.'' Conversely, a positive gate-to-source voltage increases the channel size and allows electrons to flow easily (see right figure, when there is a conduction channel and current is large).\n\nIn an n-channel ''enhancement-mode'' device, a conductive channel does not exist naturally within the transistor, and a positive gate-to-source voltage is necessary to create one. The positive voltage attracts free-floating electrons within the body towards the gate, forming a conductive channel. But first, enough electrons must be attracted near the gate to counter the dopant ions added to the body of the FET; this forms a region with no mobile carriers called a [[depletion region]], and the voltage at which this occurs is referred to as the ''[[threshold voltage]]'' of the FET. Further gate-to-source voltage increase will attract even more electrons towards the gate which are able to create a conductive channel from source to drain; this process is called ''inversion''.\n\n====p-channel====\nIn a p-channel ''depletion-mode'' device, a positive voltage from gate to body creates a depletion layer by forcing the positively charged holes to the gate-insulator/semiconductor interface, leaving exposed a carrier-free region of immobile, negatively charged acceptor ions.\n\n===Effect of source/drain voltage on channel===\nFor either enhancement- or depletion-mode devices, at drain-to-source voltages much less than gate-to-source voltages, changing the gate voltage will alter the channel resistance, and drain current will be proportional to drain voltage (referenced to source voltage). In this mode the FET operates like a variable resistor and the FET is said to be operating in a ''linear mode'' or ''ohmic mode''.<ref name=Schneider>{{cite book\n|author1=C Galup-Montoro |author2=Schneider MC |title=MOSFET modeling for circuit analysis and design\n|year= 2007\n|page=83\n|publisher=World Scientific\n|location=London/Singapore\n|isbn=981-256-810-7}}\n</ref><ref name=Malik>\n{{cite book\n|author=Norbert R Malik\n|title=Electronic circuits: analysis, simulation, and design\n|year= 1995\n|pages=315\u2013316\n|publisher=Prentice Hall\n|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ\n|isbn=0-02-374910-5}}\n</ref>\n\nIf drain-to-source voltage is increased, this creates a significant asymmetrical change in the shape of the channel due to a gradient of voltage potential from source to drain. The shape of the inversion region becomes \"pinched-off\" near the drain end of the channel. If drain-to-source voltage is increased further, the pinch-off point of the channel begins to move away from the drain towards the source. The FET is said to be in ''saturation mode'';<ref name=Spencer>\n{{cite book\n|author1=RR Spencer |author2=Ghausi MS |title=Microelectronic circuits\n|year= 2001\n|page=102\n|publisher=Pearson Education/Prentice-Hall\n|location=Upper Saddle River NJ\n|isbn=0-201-36183-3}}\n</ref> although some authors refer to it as ''active mode'', for a better analogy with bipolar transistor operating regions.<ref name=Sedra>\n{{cite book\n|author1=A.

The in-between region is sometimes considered to be part of the ohmic or linear region, even where drain current is not approximately linear with drain voltage.\n\nEven though the conductive channel formed by gate-to-source voltage no longer connects source to drain during saturation mode, [[Charge carriers|carriers]] are not blocked from flowing. Considering again an n-channel enhancement-mode device, a [[depletion region]] exists in the p-type body, surrounding the conductive channel and drain and source regions. The electrons which comprise the channel are free to move out of the channel through the depletion region if attracted to the drain by drain-to-source voltage. The depletion region is free of carriers and has a resistance similar to [[silicon]]. Any increase of the drain-to-source voltage will increase the distance from drain to the pinch-off point, increasing the resistance of the depletion region in proportion to the drain-to-source voltage applied. This proportional change causes the drain-to-source current to remain relatively fixed, independent of changes to the drain-to-source voltage, quite unlike its ohmic behavior in the linear mode of operation. Thus, in saturation mode, the FET behaves as a [[current source|constant-current source]] rather than as a resistor, and can effectively be used as a voltage amplifier. In this case, the gate-to-source voltage determines the level of constant current through the channel.\n\n== Composition ==\n\nFETs can be constructed from various semiconductors, with [[silicon]] being by far the most common. Most FETs are made by using conventional bulk \n[[Semiconductor fabrication|semiconductor processing techniques]], using a [[Monocrystalline silicon|single crystal semiconductor]] [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]] as the active region, or channel.\n\nAmong the more unusual body materials are [[amorphous silicon]], [[polycrystalline silicon]] or other amorphous semiconductors in [[thin-film transistor]]s or [[organic field-effect transistor]]s (OFETs) that are based on [[organic semiconductor]]s; often, OFET gate insulators and electrodes are made of organic materials, as well. Such FETs are manufactured using a variety of materials such as silicon carbide (SiC), gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium nitride (GaN), and indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs).\nIn June 2011, IBM announced that it had successfully used [[graphene]]-based FETs in an [[integrated circuit]].<ref>[http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-06-ibm-graphene-based-circuit.html IBM creates first graphene based integrated circuit<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author1=Lin, Y.-M. |author2=Valdes-Garcia, A. |author3=Han, S.-J. |author4=Farmer, D.

Because base current noise will increase with shaping time,<ref>http://www-physics.lbl.gov/~spieler/physics_198_notes/PDF/VIII-5-noise.pdf</ref> a FET typically produces less noise than a [[bipolar junction transistor]] (BJT), and is thus found in noise sensitive electronics such as tuners and [[low-noise amplifier]]s for [[VHF]] and satellite receivers. It is relatively immune to radiation. It exhibits no offset voltage at zero drain current and hence makes an excellent signal chopper. It typically has better thermal stability than a BJT.<ref name=\"millman\"/> Because they are controlled by gate charge, once the gate is closed or opened, there is no additional power draw, as there would be with a [[bipolar junction transistor]] or with non-latching [[relay]]s in some states. This allows extremely low-power switching, which in turn allows greater miniaturization of circuits because heat dissipation needs are reduced compared to other types of switches.\n\n==Disadvantages==\n\nIt has a relatively low [[gain\u2013bandwidth product]] compared to a BJT.  The MOSFET has a drawback of being very susceptible to overload voltages, thus requiring special handling during installation.<ref name=mottershead>\n{{cite book\n|author=Allen Mottershead\n|title=Electronic devices and circuits\n|year= 2004\n|publisher=Prentice-Hall of India\n|location=New Delhi\n|ISBN=81-203-0124-2}}\n</ref>\nThe fragile insulating layer of the MOSFET between the gate and channel makes it vulnerable to [[electrostatic discharge|electrostatic damage]] or changes to threshold voltage during handling. This is not usually a problem after the device has been installed in a properly designed circuit.\n\nFETs often have a very low 'on' resistance and have a high 'off' resistance. However the intermediate resistances are significant, and so FETs can dissipate large amounts of power while switching. Thus efficiency can put a premium on switching quickly, but this can cause transients that can excite stray inductances and generate significant voltages that can couple to the gate and cause unintentional switching. FET circuits can therefore require very careful layout and can involve trades between switching speed and power dissipation. There is also a trade-off between voltage rating and 'on' resistance, so high voltage FETs have a relatively high 'on' resistance and hence conduction losses.\n\n== Uses ==\nThe most commonly used FET is the [[MOSFET]]. The [[CMOS]] (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) process technology is the basis for modern [[Digital data|digital]] [[integrated circuit]]s. This [[Semiconductor device fabrication|process technology]] uses an arrangement where the (usually \"enhancement-mode\") p-channel MOSFET and n-channel MOSFET are connected in series such that when one is ON, the other is OFF.\n\nIn FETs, electrons can flow in either direction through the channel when operated in the linear mode. The naming convention of drain terminal and source terminal is somewhat arbitrary, as the devices are typically (but not always) built symmetrically from source to drain. This makes FETs suitable for switching analog signals between paths ([[multiplexing]]). With this concept, one can construct a solid-state [[mixing board]], for example.\n\nA common use of the FET is as an amplifier. For example, due to its large input resistance and low output resistance, it is effective as a buffer in [[common-drain]] (source follower) configuration.\n\nIGBTs are used in switching internal combustion engine ignition coils, where fast switching and voltage blocking capabilities are important.\n\n== Source-gated transistor ==\nSource-gated transistors are more robust to manufacturing and environmental issues in large-area electronics such as display screens, but are slower in operation than FETs.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/articles/srep04295 \"Source-gated transistors for order-of-magnitude performance improvements in thin-film digital circuits\"]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Bio-FET]]\n* [[Chemical field-effect transistor]]\n* [[FET amplifier]]\n* [[ISFET]]\n* [[MOSFET]]\n* [[Quantum field effect transistor]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{Commons category|Field-effect Transistors}}\n* [http://www.pbs.org/transistor/science/info/transmodern.html PBS The Field Effect Transistor]\n* [http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/data/semicond/fet-field-effect-transistor/junction-jfet-basics-tutorial.php Junction Field Effect Transistor]\n* [http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_4/chpt_3/7.html CMOS gate circuitry]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160105144331/http://www.analog.com/library/analogDialogue/archives/35-05/latchup/ Winning the Battle Against Latchup in CMOS Analog Switches]\n* [http://www.freescale.com/files/rf_if/doc/app_note/AN211A.pdf Field Effect Transistors in Theory and Practice]\n* [http://ljmayes.pnyhost.com/comp/vcr.html The Field Effect Transistor as a Voltage Controlled Resistor]\n\n{{Transistor amplifiers}}\n{{Electronic component}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Field-Effect Transistor}}\n[[Category:Transistor types]]\n[[Category:FETs]]"}]}}}}
