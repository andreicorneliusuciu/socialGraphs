The movement or displacement of such mobile defects is thermally activated, and thus limited by the rate of atomic diffusion. <ref name=\"Dav\">Davidge, R.W., '''Mechanical Behavior of Ceramics''', Cambridge Solid State Science Series, Eds.

Clarke, D.R., et al.(1991)</ref>\n\nDeformation is often described as [[strain (materials science)|strain]].\n\nAs deformation occurs, internal inter-molecular forces arise that oppose the applied force. If the applied force is not too great these forces may be sufficient to completely resist the applied force and allow the object to assume a new equilibrium state and to return to its original state when the load is removed. A larger applied force may lead to a permanent deformation of the object or even to its [[structural failure]].\n\nIn the figure it can be seen that the compressive loading (indicated by the arrow) has caused deformation in the [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] so that the original shape (dashed lines) has changed (deformed) into one with bulging sides. The sides bulge because the material, although strong enough to not crack or otherwise fail, is not strong enough to support the load without change, thus the material is forced out laterally. Internal forces (in this case at right angles to the deformation) resist the applied load.\n\nThe concept of a [[rigid body]] can be applied if the deformation is negligible.\n\n== Types of deformation ==\n\nDepending on the type of material, size and geometry of the object, and the forces applied, various types of deformation may result. The image to the right shows the engineering stress vs. strain diagram for a typical ductile material such as steel. Different deformation modes may occur under different conditions, as can be depicted using a [[deformation mechanism map]].\n\n[[File:Stress Strain Ductile Material.png|thumb|right|450px|Typical stress vs. strain diagram indicating the various stages of deformation.]]\n\n===Elastic deformation===\n<!--[[Elastic deformation]] redirects here-->\n{{more|Elasticity (physics)}}\nThis type of deformation is reversible. Once the forces are no longer applied, the object returns to its original shape. [[Elastomer]]s and [[shape memory]] metals such as [[Nitinol]] exhibit large elastic deformation ranges, as does [[rubber]]. However elasticity is nonlinear in these materials. Normal metals, ceramics and most crystals show linear elasticity and a smaller elastic range. \n\nLinear elastic deformation is governed by [[Hooke's law]], which states:\n\n:<math>\\sigma = E \\varepsilon</math>\n\nWhere <math>\\sigma</math> is the applied [[stress (physics)|stress]], <math>E</math> is a material constant called [[Young's modulus]] or [[elastic modulus]], and \u03b5 is the resulting [[strain (materials science)|strain]]. This relationship only applies in the elastic range and indicates that the slope of the stress vs. strain curve can be used to find Young's modulus (<math>E</math>). Engineers often use this calculation in tensile tests. The [[linear elasticity|elastic range]] ends when the material reaches its [[yield stress|yield strength]]. At this point plastic deformation begins.\n\nNote that not all elastic materials undergo linear elastic deformation; some, such as concrete, gray cast iron, and many polymers, respond in a nonlinear fashion. For these materials Hooke's law is inapplicable.<ref>Fundamentals of Materials Science and Engineering, William D. Callister, John Wiley and Sons, 2nd International edition (September 3, 2004), ISBN 0-471-66081-7, ISBN 978-0-471-66081-1, p.184</ref>\n\n===Plastic deformation===\n<!--[[Plastic deformation]] redirects here-->\n{{see also|Plasticity (physics)}}\nThis type of deformation is irreversible. However, an object in the plastic deformation range will first have undergone elastic deformation, which is reversible, so the object will return part way to its original shape. Soft [[thermoplastics]] have a rather large plastic deformation range as do ductile metals such as [[copper]], [[silver]], and [[gold]].  [[Steel]] does, too, but not [[cast iron]].  Hard thermosetting plastics, rubber, crystals, and ceramics have minimal plastic deformation ranges.  One material with a large plastic deformation range is wet [[chewing gum]], which can be stretched dozens of times its original length.\n\nUnder tensile stress, plastic deformation is characterized by a [[strain hardening]] region and a [[necking (engineering)|necking]] region and finally, fracture (also called rupture). During strain hardening the material becomes stronger through the movement of [[dislocation|atomic dislocations]]. The necking phase is indicated by a reduction in cross-sectional area of the specimen. Necking begins after the ultimate strength is reached. During necking, the material can no longer withstand the maximum stress and the strain in the specimen rapidly increases. Plastic deformation ends with the fracture of the material.\n\n====Metal fatigue====\nAnother deformation mechanism is [[metal fatigue]], which occurs primarily in [[ductile]] metals. It was originally thought that a material deformed only within the elastic range returned completely to its original state once the forces were removed. However, faults are introduced at the molecular level with each deformation. After many deformations, cracks will begin to appear, followed soon after by a fracture, with no apparent plastic deformation in between. Depending on the material, shape, and how close to the elastic limit it is deformed, failure may require thousands, millions, billions, or trillions of deformations.\n\nMetal fatigue has been a major cause of aircraft failure, especially before the process was well understood (see, for example, the [[De Havilland Comet#Accidents and incidents|De Havilland Comet accidents]]). There are two ways to determine when a part is in danger of metal fatigue; either predict when failure will occur due to the material/force/shape/iteration combination, and replace the vulnerable materials before this occurs, or perform inspections to detect the microscopic cracks and perform replacement once they occur. Selection of materials not likely to suffer from metal fatigue during the life of the product is the best solution, but not always possible. Avoiding shapes with sharp corners limits metal fatigue by reducing stress concentrations, but does not eliminate it.\n\n[[File:stress-strain1.svg|thumb|right|300px|Diagram of a [[stress\u2013strain curve]], showing the relationship between stress (force applied) and strain (deformation) of a ductile metal.]]\n\n====Compressive failure====\nUsually, compressive stress applied to bars, [[column]]s, etc. leads to shortening.\n\nLoading a structural element or specimen will increase the compressive stress until it reaches its [[compressive strength]].  According to the properties of the material, failure modes are [[Yield (engineering)|yielding]] for materials with [[ductile]] behavior (most [[metal]]s, some [[soil]]s and [[plastic]]s) or rupturing for brittle behavior (geomaterials, [[cast iron]], [[glass]], etc.).\n\nIn long, slender structural elements \u2014 such as columns or [[truss]] bars \u2014 an increase of compressive force ''F'' leads to [[structural failure]] due to [[buckling]] at lower stress than the compressive strength.\n\n===Fracture===\n{{See also|Concrete fracture analysis|Fracture mechanics}}\nThis type of deformation is also irreversible. A break occurs after the material has reached the end of the elastic, and then plastic, deformation ranges. At this point forces accumulate until they are sufficient to cause a fracture. All materials will eventually fracture, if sufficient forces are applied.\n\n==Misconceptions==\nA popular misconception is that all materials that bend are \"weak\" and those that don't are \"strong.\" In reality, many materials that undergo large elastic and plastic deformations, such as steel, are able to absorb stresses that would cause brittle materials, such as glass, with minimal plastic deformation ranges, to break.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Structural glass|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7t9wgJEUWHYC&pg=PA33|page=33|author=Peter Rice, Hugh Dutton|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=0-419-19940-3|year=1995}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*[[Artificial cranial deformation]]\n*[[Creep (deformation)]]\n*[[Deflection (engineering)]]\n*[[Deformable body]]\n*[[Deformation (mechanics)]]\n*[[Deformation mechanism maps]]\n*[[Deformation Monitoring]]\n*[[Deformation retract]]\n*[[Deformation theory]]\n*[[Discontinuous Deformation Analysis]]\n*[[Elastic (solid mechanics)|Elastic]]\n*[[Finite deformation tensors]]\n*[[Malleability]]\n*[[Planar deformation features]]\n*[[Plasticity (physics)]]\n*[[Poisson's ratio]]\n*[[Strain tensor]]\n*[[Strength of materials]]\n*[[Wood warping]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://virtualexplorer.com.au/special/meansvolume/contribs/jessell/glossary/defmech.html Table of deformation mechanisms and processes]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Deformation (Engineering)}}\n[[Category:Solid mechanics]]\n[[Category:Deformation (mechanics)]]\n\n[[az:Deformasiya]]\n[[bg:\u0414\u0435\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f]]\n[[cs:Deformace]]\n[[de:Verformung]]\n[[et:Deformatsioon]]\n[[es:Deformaci\u00f3n]]\n[[eo:Deformi\u011do]]\n[[fr:D\u00e9formation des mat\u00e9riaux]]\n[[gl:Deformaci\u00f3n]]\n[[it:Deformazione]]\n[[lv:Deform\u0101cija]]\n[[lt:K\u016bno deformacija]]\n[[no:Deformasjon]]\n[[pt:Deforma\u00e7\u00e3o]]\n[[simple:Deformation]]\n[[sk:Deform\u00e1cia (mechanika)]]\n[[sv:Deformation]]\n[[tr:\u015eekil de\u011fi\u015ftirme]]\n[[uk:\u0414\u0435\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0456\u044f]]\n[[vec:Deformasion]]\n[[zh:\u5f62\u8b8a]]"}]}}}}
