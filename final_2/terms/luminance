It describes the amount of light that passes through, is emitted or reflected from a particular area, and falls within a given [[solid angle]]. The [[SI]] unit for luminance is [[candela per square metre]] (cd/m<sup>2</sup>). A non-SI term for the same unit is the \"nit\". The [[CGS]] unit of luminance is the [[stilb (luminance)|stilb]], which is equal to one candela per square centimetre or 10&nbsp;kcd/m<sup>2</sup>.\n\n==Explanation==\nLuminance is often used to characterize emission or reflection from flat, [[diffuse reflection|diffuse]] surfaces. The luminance indicates how much [[luminous flux|luminous power]] will be detected by an [[Human eye|eye]] looking at the surface from a particular angle of view. Luminance is thus an indicator of how [[brightness|bright]] the surface will appear. In this case, the solid angle of interest is the solid angle subtended by the eye's [[pupil]]. Luminance is used in the video industry to characterize the brightness of displays. A typical computer display emits between 50 and {{val|300|u=cd/m<sup>2</sup>}}. The sun has luminance of about {{val|1.6|e=9|u=cd/m<sup>2</sup>}} at noon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.schorsch.com/kbase/glossary/luminance.html |title=Luminance |work=Lighting Design Glossary |accessdate=Apr 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\nLuminance is [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] in [[geometric optics]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Handbook of Optical Systems |volume=5, Metrology of Optical Components and Systems |first1=Bernd |last1=D\u00f6rband |first2=Herbert |last2=Gross |first3=Henriette |last3=M\u00fcller |page=326 |publisher=Wiley |year=2012 |isbn=978-3-527-40381-3 |editor-first=Herbert |editor-last=Gross}}</ref> This means that for an ideal optical system, the luminance at the output is the same as the input luminance. For real, passive, optical systems, the output luminance is ''at most'' equal to the input. As an example, if one uses a lens to form an image that is smaller than the source object, the luminous power is concentrated into a smaller area, meaning that the [[illuminance]] is higher at the image. The light at the image plane, however, fills a larger solid angle so the luminance comes out to be the same assuming there is no loss at the lens. The image can never be \"brighter\" than the source.\n\n== Definition ==\n[[Image:Etendue-Free space.png|right|thumb|Parameters for defining the luminance]]\nThe luminance of a specified point of a light source, in a specified direction, is defined by the [[derivative]]\n\n:<math>\nL_\\mathrm{v} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2\\Phi_\\mathrm{v}}\n    {\\mathrm{d}\\Sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega_\\Sigma \\cos \\theta_\\Sigma}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n* {{var|L}}<sub>v</sub> is the luminance ([[candela|cd]]/[[square metre|m<sup>2</sup>]]),\n* d<sup>2</sup>{{var|\u03a6}}<sub>v</sub> is the [[luminous flux]] ([[Lumen (unit)|lm]]) leaving the area d{{var|\u03a3}} in any direction contained inside the solid angle d{{var|\u03a9}}<sub>\u03a3</sub>,\n* d{{var|\u03a3}} is an [[infinitesimal]] area ([[square metre|m<sup>2</sup>]]) of the source containing the specified point,\n* d{{var|\u03a9}}<sub>\u03a3</sub> is an infinitesimal [[solid angle]] ([[Steradian|sr]]) containing the specified direction,\n* {{var|\u03b8}}<sub>\u03a3</sub> is the [[angle]] between the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] '''n'''<sub>\u03a3</sub> to the surface d{{var|\u03a3}} and the specified direction.<ref>{{cite book | last = Chaves | first = Julio | title = Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | publisher = [[CRC Press]] |  year = 2015 | page = 679 | isbn = 978-1482206739}}</ref>\n\nIf light travels through a lossless medium, the luminance does not change along a given light ray. As the ray crosses an arbitrary surface ''S'', the luminance is given by\n\n:<math>\nL_\\mathrm{v} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2\\Phi_\\mathrm{v}}\n    {\\mathrm{d}S\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega_S \\cos \\theta_S}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n* d{{var|S}} is the infinitesimal area of ''S'' seen from the source inside the solid angle d{{var|\u03a9}}<sub>\u03a3</sub>,\n* d{{var|\u03a9}}<sub>S</sub> is the infinitesimal solid angle [[Subtended angle|subtended]] by d{{var|\u03a3}} as seen from d{{var|S}},\n* {{var|\u03b8}}<sub>S</sub> is the angle between the normal '''n'''<sub>S</sub> to d{{var|S}} and the direction of the light.\n\nMore generally, the luminance along a light ray can be defined as\n\n:<math>\nL_\\mathrm{v} = n^2\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Phi_\\mathrm{v}}{\\mathrm{d}G}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n* d{{var|G}} is the [[etendue]] of an infinitesimally narrow beam containing the specified ray,\n* d{{var|\u03a6}}<sub>v</sub> is the luminous flux carried by this beam,\n* {{var|n}} is the [[index of refraction]] of the medium.\n\n==Relation to Illuminance==\nThe luminance of a reflecting surface is related to the [[illuminance]] it receives:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_{\\Omega_\\Sigma} L_\\mathrm{v} \\mathrm{d}\\Omega_\\Sigma \\cos \\theta_\\Sigma\n    & = M_\\mathrm{v} \\\\\n    & = E_\\mathrm{v} R\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere the integral covers all the directions of emission {{math|\u03a9<sub>\u03a3</sub>}}, and\n* {{var|M}}<sub>v</sub> is the surface's [[luminous exitance]]\n* {{var|E}}<sub>v</sub> is the received illuminance, and\n* {{var|R}} is the [[reflectance]].\n\nIn the case of a perfectly [[diffuse reflector]] (also called a [[Lambertian reflector]]), the luminance is isotropic, per [[Lambert's cosine law]]. Then the relationship is simply\n\n:<math>\nL_\\mathrm{v} = E_\\mathrm{v} R / \\pi\n</math>\n\n==Units==\nA variety of units have been used for luminance, besides the candela per square metre.\n\nOne candela per square metre is equal to:\n*10<sup>\u22124</sup> [[stilb (unit)|stilbs]] (the [[CGS]] unit of luminance)\n*&pi; [[apostilb]]s\n*&pi;\u00d710<sup>\u22124</sup> [[lambert (unit)|lambert]]s\n*0.292 [[foot-lambert]]s\n\n==Health effects==\n{{see also|Laser safety}}\nRetinal damage can occur when the eye is exposed to high luminance. Damage can occur due to local heating of the retina. Photochemical effects can also cause damage, especially at short wavelengths.\n==See also==\n*[[Orders of magnitude (luminance)]]\n*[[Diffuse reflection]]\n*[[Etendue]]\n*[[Exposure value#EV as a measure of luminance and illuminance|Exposure value]]\n*[[Lambertian reflectance]]\n*[[Lightness (color)|Lightness]], property of a color\n*[[Luma (video)|Luma]], the representation of luminance in a video monitor\n*[[Lumen (unit)]]\n*[[Radiance]], radiometric quantity analogous to luminance\n*[[Brightness]], the subjective impression of luminance\n*[[Glare (vision)|Glare]]\n*[[Luminance meter]]\n{{SI light units}}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n* A Kodak guide to [http://www.kodak.com/cluster/global/en/consumer/products/techInfo/am105/am105kic.shtml Estimating Luminance and Illuminance] using a camera's exposure meter.
