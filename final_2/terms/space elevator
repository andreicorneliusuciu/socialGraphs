At the bottom of the tall diagram is the Earth as viewed from high above the North Pole.  About six earth-radii above the Earth an arc is drawn with the same center as the Earth.  The arc depicts the level of geosynchronous orbit.  About twice as high as the arc and directly above the Earth's center, a counterweight is depicted by a small square.  A line depicting the space elevator's cable connects the counterweight to the equator directly below it.  The system's center of mass is described as above the level of geosynchronous orbit.  The center of mass is shown roughly to be about a quarter of the way up from the geosynchronous arc to the counterweight.  The bottom of the cable is indicated to be anchored at the equator.  A climber is depicted by a small rounded square.  The climber is shown climbing the cable about one third of the way from the ground to the arc. Another note indicates that the cable rotates along with the Earth's daily rotation, and remains vertical. |A '''space elevator''' is conceived as a cable fixed to the equator and reaching into space.  A counterweight at the upper end keeps the [[center of mass]] well above geostationary orbit level. This produces enough upward [[centrifugal force]] from Earth's rotation to fully counter the downward gravity, keeping the cable upright and taut.

The design would permit vehicles to travel along the cable from a planetary surface, such as the Earth's, directly into space or orbit, [[non-rocket spacelaunch|without the use of large rockets]]. An Earth-based space elevator would consist of a cable with one end attached to the surface near the equator and the other end in space beyond [[geostationary orbit]] (35,800&nbsp;km altitude). The competing forces of gravity, which is stronger at the lower end, and the outward/upward centrifugal force, which is stronger at the upper end, would result in the cable being held up, under tension, and stationary over a single position on Earth.  With the tether deployed, climbers could repeatedly climb the tether to space by mechanical means, releasing their cargo to orbit.  Climbers could also descend the tether to return cargo to the surface from orbit.<ref name=Edwards>Edwards, Bradley Carl.

E. Tsiolkovsky in his \"Speculations about Earth and Sky and on Vesta.\"}}</ref>  His proposal was for a free-standing tower reaching from the surface of Earth to the height of geostationary orbit. Like all buildings, Tsiolkovsky's structure would be under [[Compression (physical)|compression]], supporting its weight from below. Since 1959, most ideas for space elevators have focused on purely [[Tension (physics)|tensile]] structures, with the weight of the system held up from above by centrifugal forces. In the tensile concepts, a [[space tether]] reaches from a large mass (the counterweight) beyond geostationary orbit to the ground. This structure is held in tension between Earth and the counterweight like an upside-down [[plumb bob]].\n\nTo construct a space elevator on Earth the cable material would need to be both stronger and lighter (have greater [[specific strength]]) than any known material.  Development of new materials which could meet the demanding specific strength requirement is required for designs to progress beyond discussion stage.  [[Carbon nanotube]]s (CNTs) have been identified as possibly being able to meet the specific strength requirements for an Earth space elevator.<ref name=Edwards/><ref name=BBCfuture>http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150211-space-elevators-a-lift-too-far</ref>  Other materials considered have been [[boron nitride nanotube]]s, and [[carbon nanothread|diamond nanothreads]] which were first constructed in 2014.<ref name=SCIAM_DN /><ref name=Xtech_DN />\n\nThe concept is applicable to other planets and [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]]. For locations in the solar system with weaker gravity than Earth's (such as the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]]), the strength-to-density requirements for tether materials are not as problematic. Currently available materials (such as [[Kevlar]]) are strong and light enough that they could be used as the tether material for elevators there.<ref>[[Hans Moravec|Moravec, Hans]] (1978).

He considered a similar tower that reached all the way into space and was built from the ground up to the altitude of 35,790 kilometers, the height of [[geostationary orbit]].<ref name=\"NASASci\">{{cite web|url=http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast07sep_1.htm|title=The Audacious Space Elevator|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NASA Science News|dead-url=yes|accessdate=September 27, 2008}}</ref> He noted that the top of such a tower would be circling [[Earth]] as in a geostationary orbit. Objects would attain horizontal velocity as they rode up the tower, and an object released at the tower's top would have enough horizontal velocity to remain there in geostationary orbit. Tsiolkovsky's conceptual tower was a compression structure, while modern concepts call for a [[tensile structure]] (or \"tether\").\n\n===20th century===\nBuilding a compression structure from the ground up proved an unrealistic task as there was no material in existence with enough compressive strength to support its own weight under such conditions.<ref name=\"JBIS1999\">{{cite journal\n |author1=Landis, Geoffrey A.  |author2=Cafarelli, Craig \n  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1999\n | title = The Tsiolkovski Tower Reexamined\n | journal = Journal of the British Interplanetary Society\n | volume = 52\n | pages = 175\u2013180\n | others = Presented as paper IAF-95-V.4.07, 46th International Astronautics Federation Congress, Oslo Norway, October 2\u20136, 1995\n |bibcode = 1999JBIS...52..175L }}\n</ref> In 1959 another Russian scientist, [[Yuri N. Artsutanov]], suggested a more feasible proposal. Artsutanov suggested using a geostationary [[satellite]] as the base from which to deploy the structure downward. By using a [[counterweight]], a cable would be lowered from geostationary orbit to the surface of Earth, while the counterweight was extended from the satellite away from Earth, keeping the cable constantly over the same spot on the surface of the Earth. Artsutanov's idea was introduced to the Russian-speaking public in an interview published in the Sunday supplement of ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' in 1960,<ref name=\"artsutanov\">{{cite web\n|url=http://liftport.com/files/Artsutanov_Pravda_SE.pdf\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506100948/http://liftport.com/files/Artsutanov_Pravda_SE.pdf\n|archivedate=May 6, 2006 |title=To the Cosmos by Electric Train\n|work=liftport.com\n|format=PDF\n|year=1960\n|publisher=Young Person's Pravda\n|last=Artsutanov\n|first=Yu\n|accessdate=March 5, 2006}}</ref> but was not available in English until much later. He also proposed tapering the cable thickness so that the stress in the cable was constant. This gave a thinner cable at ground level that became thickest at the level of geostationary orbit.\n\nBoth the tower and cable ideas were proposed in the quasi-humorous [[Daedalus (Ariadne)|''Ariadne'' column]] in ''[[New Scientist]]'', December 24, 1964.\n\nIn 1966, Isaacs, Vine, Bradner and Bachus, four [[United States|American]] engineers, reinvented the concept, naming it a \"Sky-Hook,\" and published their analysis in the journal [[Science (journal)|''Science'']].<ref>{{cite journal\n|title=Satellite Elongation into a True 'Sky-Hook'\n|year=1966\n|journal= Science\n|volume = 11\n| doi = 10.1126/science.151.3711.682\n|author=Isaacs, J.

He designed<ref name=\"pearson\">\n{{cite journal\n | author = Pearson, J.\n | year = 1975\n | title = The orbital tower: a spacecraft launcher using the Earth's rotational energy\n | url = http://www.star-tech-inc.com/papers/tower/tower.pdf\n | journal = Acta Astronautica\n | volume = 2\n | pages = 785\u2013799\n | doi = 10.1016/0094-5765(75)90021-1\n | format = PDF <!--Retrieved from CrossRef by DOI bot-->\n | issue = 9\u201310\n}}\n</ref> a tapered cross section that would be better suited to building the elevator. The completed cable would be thickest at the geostationary orbit, where the tension was greatest, and would be narrowest at the tips to reduce the amount of weight per unit area of cross section that any point on the cable would have to bear. He suggested using a counterweight that would be slowly extended out to {{convert|144,000|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}}, almost half the distance to the [[Moon]] as the lower section of the elevator was built. Without a large counterweight, the upper portion of the cable would have to be longer than the lower due to the way [[gravity|gravitational]] and centrifugal forces change with distance from Earth. His analysis included disturbances such as the gravitation of the Moon, wind and moving payloads up and down the cable. The weight of the material needed to build the elevator would have required thousands of [[Space Shuttle]] trips, although part of the material could be transported up the elevator when a minimum strength strand reached the ground or be manufactured in space from [[Asteroid mining|asteroidal]] or [[In-situ resource utilization|lunar ore]].\n\nIn 1979, space elevators were introduced to a broader audience with the simultaneous publication of [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel, ''[[The Fountains of Paradise]]'', in which engineers construct a space elevator on top of a mountain peak in the fictional island country of ''Taprobane'' (loosely based on [[Sri Lanka]], albeit moved south to the Equator), and [[Charles Sheffield]]'s first novel, ''[[The Web Between the Worlds]]'', also featuring the building of a space elevator. Three years later, in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s 1982 novel ''[[Friday (novel)|Friday]]'' the principal character makes use of the \"Nairobi Beanstalk\" in the course of her travels. In [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s 1993 novel ''[[Red Mars]]'', colonists build a space elevator on Mars that allows both for more colonists to arrive and also for natural resources mined there to be able to leave for Earth. In [[David Gerrold]]'s 2000 novel, ''[[Jumping Off The Planet]]'', a family excursion up the Ecuador \"beanstalk\" is actually a child-custody kidnapping. Gerrold's book also examines some of the industrial applications of a mature elevator technology. In a biological version, [[Joan Slonczewski]]'s novel ''The Highest Frontier'' depicts a college student ascending a space elevator constructed of self-healing cables of anthrax bacilli. The engineered bacteria can regrow the cables when severed by space debris.\n\nAfter the development of [[carbon nanotubes]] in the 1990s, engineer David Smitherman of [[NASA]]/Marshall's Advanced Projects Office realized that the high strength of these materials might make the concept of a space elevator feasible, and put together a workshop at the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], inviting many scientists and engineers to discuss concepts and compile plans for an elevator to turn the concept into a reality.\n\nIn 2000, another American scientist, [[Bradley C. Edwards]], suggested creating a {{convert|100,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} long paper-thin ribbon using a carbon nanotube composite material.<ref name=EDWARDS_PHASE_I_2000_472Edwards.html>Bradley C. Edwards, Ph.D., \"The Space Elevator\", http://www.niac.usra.edu/studies/472Edwards.html</ref>  He chose the wide-thin ribbon-like cross-section shape rather than earlier circular cross-section concepts because that shape would stand a greater chance of surviving impacts by meteoroids. The ribbon cross-section shape also provided large surface area for climbers to climb with simple rollers. Supported by the [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts]], Edwards' work was expanded to cover the deployment scenario, climber design, power delivery system, [[Space debris|orbital debris]] avoidance, anchor system, surviving [[atomic oxygen]], avoiding lightning and hurricanes by locating the anchor in the western equatorial Pacific, construction costs, construction schedule, and environmental hazards.<ref name=Edwards/><ref>[http://www.nss.org/resources/library/spaceelevator/2000-SpaceElevator-NASA-CP210429.pdf Space Elevators: An Advanced Earth-Space Infrastructure for the New Millennium], NASA/CP-2000-210429, Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama, 2000</ref><ref>Science @ NASA, [http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast07sep_1.htm Audacious & Outrageous: Space Elevators], September 2000</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Space Elevators: An Advanced Earth-Space Infrastructure for the New Millennium | url = http://www.affordablespaceflight.com/spaceelevator.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070221162221/http://www.affordablespaceflight.com/spaceelevator.html| archivedate = February 21, 2007|work=affordablespaceflight.com}}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\n\nTo speed space elevator development, proponents have organized several [[Space Elevator Competitions|competitions]], similar to the [[Ansari X Prize]], for relevant technologies.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/5792719/\n|title=Space elevator contest proposed\n|first=Alan\n|last=Boyle\n|publisher=MSNBC\n|date=August 27, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.elevator2010.org/\n|title=The Space Elevator \u2013 Elevator:2010\n|accessdate=March 5, 2006}}</ref> Among them are [[Elevator:2010]], which organized annual competitions for climbers, ribbons and power-beaming systems from 2005 to 2009, the Robogames Space Elevator Ribbon Climbing competition,<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://robogames.net/rules/climbing.php\n|title=Space Elevator Ribbon Climbing Robot Competition Rules\n|accessdate=March 5, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050206100051/http://robolympics.net/rules/climbing.shtml|archivedate=February 6, 2005 }}</ref> as well as NASA's [[Centennial Challenges]] program, which, in March 2005, announced a partnership with the [[Spaceward Foundation]] (the operator of Elevator:2010), raising the total value of prizes to US$400,000.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/mar/HQ_m05083_Centennial_prizes.html\n|title=NASA Announces First Centennial Challenges' Prizes\n|year=2005\n|accessdate=March 5, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.space.com/news/050323_centennial_challenge.html\n|title=NASA Details Cash Prizes for Space Privatization\n|first=Robert Roy\n|last=Britt\n|publisher=Space.com\n|accessdate=March 5, 2006}}</ref>\nThe first European Space Elevator Challenge (EuSEC) to establish a climber structure took place in August 2011.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=What's the European Space Elevator Challenge?\n|url=http://eusec.warr.de/?eusec|publisher=European Space Elevator Challenge\n|accessdate=April 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, \"the [[LiftPort Group]] of space elevator companies announced that it will be building a carbon nanotube manufacturing plant in [[Millville, New Jersey]], to supply various glass, plastic and metal companies with these strong materials.

Therefore, objects attached to the cable would experience upward centrifugal force in the direction opposing the downward gravitational force. The higher up the cable the object is located, the less the gravitational pull of the Earth, and the stronger the upward centrifugal force due to the rotation, so that more centrifugal force opposes less gravity. The centrifugal force and the gravity are balanced at geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO). Above GEO, the centrifugal force is stronger than gravity, causing objects attached to the cable there to pull ''upward'' on it.\n\nThe net force for objects attached to the cable is called the ''apparent gravitational field''.  The apparent gravitational field for attached objects is the (downward) gravity minus the (upward) centrifugal force. The apparent gravity experienced by an object on the cable is zero at GEO, downward below GEO, and upward above GEO.\n\nThe apparent gravitational field can be represented this way:{{rp | Ref<ref name=\"aravind\"/> Table 1}}\n\n:The downward force of actual [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|gravity]] ''decreases'' with height:  [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|<math>g_r  = -G \\cdot M/r^2</math>]]\n\n:The upward [[centrifugal force]] due to the planet's rotation ''increases'' with height:  [[Centrifugal force|<math>a  = \\omega^2 \\cdot r</math>]]\n\n:Together, the apparent gravitational field is the sum of the two:\n\n:<math>   g  = -G \\cdot M/r^2 + \\omega^2 \\cdot r</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:''g'' is the acceleration of ''apparent'' gravity, pointing down (negative) or up (positive) along the vertical cable (m s<sup>\u22122</sup>),\n:''g<sub>r</sub>'' is the gravitational acceleration due to Earth's pull, pointing down (negative)(m s<sup>\u22122</sup>), <!-- g_r as a subscript only works following < math > -->\n:''a'' is the centrifugal acceleration, pointing up (positive) along the vertical cable (m s<sup>\u22122</sup>),\n:''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]] (m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>\u22122</sup> kg<sup>\u22121</sup>)\n:''M'' is the mass of the Earth (kg)\n:''r'' is the distance from that point to Earth's center (m),\n:''\u03c9'' is Earth's rotation speed (radian/s).\n\nAt some point up the cable, the two terms (downward gravity and upward centrifugal force) are equal and opposite. Objects fixed to the cable at that point put no weight on the cable. This altitude (r<sub>1</sub>) depends on the mass of the planet and its rotation rate. Setting actual gravity equal to centrifugal acceleration gives:{{rp | Ref<ref name=\"aravind\"/> page 126}}\n:<math>r_1 = (G \\cdot M/\\omega^2)^{1/3}</math>\n\nOn Earth, this distance is {{convert|35786|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} above the surface, the altitude of geostationary orbit.{{rp | Ref<ref name=\"aravind\"/> Table 1}}\n\nOn the cable ''below'' geostationary orbit, downward gravity would be greater than the upward centrifugal force, so the apparent gravity would pull objects attached to the cable downward.  Any object released from the cable below that level would initially accelerate downward along the cable.  Then gradually it would deflect eastward from the cable.  On the cable ''above'' the level of stationary orbit, upward centrifugal force would be greater than downward gravity, so the apparent gravity would pull objects attached to the cable ''upward''.  Any object released from the cable ''above'' the geosynchronous level would initially accelerate ''upward'' along the cable.  Then gradually it would deflect westward from the cable.\n\n===Cable section===\nHistorically, the main technical problem has been considered the ability of the cable to hold up, with tension, the weight of itself below any given point. The greatest tension on a space elevator cable is at the point of geostationary orbit, {{convert|35786|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} above the Earth's equator. This means that the cable material, combined with its design, must be strong enough to hold up its own weight from the surface up to {{convert|35786|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. A cable which is thicker in cross section at that height than at the surface could better hold up its own weight over a longer length. How the cross section area tapers from the maximum at {{convert|35786|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the minimum at the surface is therefore an important design factor for a space elevator cable.\n\nTo maximize the usable excess strength for a given amount of cable material, the cable's cross section area would need to be designed for the most part in such a way that the [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] (i.e., the tension per unit of cross sectional area) is constant along the length of the cable.<ref name=\"aravind\"/><ref>\nArtukovi\u0107, Ranko (2000). [http://www.zadar.net/space-elevator/ \"The Space Elevator\".] zadar.net</ref>  The constant-stress criterion is a starting point in the design of the cable cross section as it changes with altitude. Other factors considered in more detailed designs include thickening at altitudes where more space junk is present, consideration of the point stresses imposed by climbers, and the use of varied materials.<ref name=PhaseII/>  To account for these and other factors, modern detailed cross section designs seek to achieve the largest ''[[Factor of safety#Margin of safety|safety margin]]'' possible, with as little variation over altitude and time as possible.<ref name=PhaseII/>  In simple starting-point designs, that equates to constant-stress.\n\nIn the constant-stress case, the cross-section follows this differential equation:{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n:<math>\\sigma \\cdot dS = g \\cdot \\rho \\cdot S \\cdot dr</math><ref name=\"aravind\"/>\nor\n:<math>dS/S = g \\cdot \\rho/\\sigma \\cdot dr</math>\nor\n:<math>dS/S =  \\rho/\\sigma \\cdot ( G \\cdot M/r^2 - \\omega^2 \\cdot r ) \\cdot dr</math>{{rp | Ref<ref name=\"aravind\"/> equation 6}}\nwhere\n:''g'' is the acceleration along the radius (m\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>),\n:''S'' is the cross-section area of the cable at any given point r, (m<sup>2</sup>) and dS its variation (m<sup>2</sup>  as well),\n:''\u03c1'' is the density of the material used for the cable (kg\u00b7m<sup>\u22123</sup>).\n:''\u03c3'' is the stress the cross-section area can bear without [[Yield (engineering)|yielding]] (N\u00b7m<sup>\u22122</sup>=kg\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>), its elastic limit.\nThe value of ''g'' is given by the first equation, which yields:\n:<math>\\Delta\\left[ \\ln (S)\\right]{}_{r_0}^{r_1}  = -\\rho/\\sigma \\cdot \\Delta\\left[ G \\cdot M/r + \\omega^2 \\cdot r^2/2 \\right]{}_{r_0}^{r_1}</math>,\nthe variation being taken between ''r<sub>0</sub>'' (ground) and  ''r<sub>1</sub>'' (geostationary).<ref name=\"aravind\"/>\n\nBetween these two points, this quantity can be expressed as:{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n<math>\\Delta\\left[ \\ln (S)\\right] = \\rho/\\sigma \\cdot g_0 \\cdot r_0 \\cdot ( 1 + x/2 - 3/2 \\cdot x^{1/3} )</math>, or\n:<math>S_1 = S_0.e^{\\rho/\\sigma \\cdot g_0 \\cdot r_0 \\cdot ( 1 + x/2 - 3/2 \\cdot x^{1/3} )}</math>{{rp | Ref<ref name=\"aravind\"/> equation 7}}\nwhere  <math>x = \\omega^2 \\cdot r_0/g_0</math> is the ratio between the centrifugal force on the equator and the gravitational force.<ref name=\"aravind\"/>\n\n===Cable material===\n{{Original research section|small=yes|date=October 2012}}\nTo compare materials, the ''[[specific strength]]'' of the material for the space elevator can be expressed in terms of the ''characteristic length'', or \"free breaking length\": the length of an un-tapered cylindrical cable at which it will break under its own weight under constant gravity. For a given material, that length is L<sub>c</sub> = ''\u03c3/(\u03c1 g<sub>0</sub>)'', \nwhere \u03c3, \u03c1 and g<sub>0</sub> are as defined above.\nThe free breaking length needed is given by the equation\n:<math>\\Delta\\left[ \\ln (S)\\right] = \\rho/\\sigma \\cdot g_0 \\cdot r_0 \\cdot ( 1 + x/2 - 3/2 \\cdot x^{1/3} )</math>,\nwhere  <math>x = w^2 \\cdot r_0/g_0.</math>\nIf one does not take into account the ''x'' factor (which reduces the strength needed by about 30 percent), this equation also says that the section ratio equals ''e'' (exponential one) when:\n:<math>\\sigma = \\rho \\cdot r_0 \\cdot g_0.</math>\nIf the material can support a free breaking length of only one tenth this, the section needed at a geosynchronous orbit will be [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']]<sup>10</sup> (a factor of 22026) times the ground section.\n\n==Structure==\n[[Image:SpaceElevatorClimbing.jpg||thumb|right|One concept for the space elevator has it tethered to a mobile seagoing platform.]]\nThere are a variety of space elevator designs. Almost every design includes a base station, a cable, climbers, and a counterweight. Earth's rotation creates upward [[centrifugal force]]<!--\"upward\" is a continuously changing direction which implies an accelerated reference frame where \"c.f.\" is unquestionable (see http://xkcd.com/123/)  --> on the counterweight. The counterweight is held down by the cable while the cable is held up and taut by the counterweight. The base station anchors the whole system to the surface of the Earth. Climbers climb up and down the cable with cargo.\n\n===Base station===\nModern concepts for the base station/anchor are typically mobile stations, large oceangoing vessels or other mobile platforms. Mobile base stations would have the advantage over the earlier stationary concepts (with land-based anchors) by being able to maneuver to avoid high winds, storms, and [[space debris]]. Oceanic anchor points are also typically in [[international waters]], simplifying and reducing cost of negotiating territory use for the base station.<ref name=Edwards/>\n\nStationary land based platforms would have simpler and less costly logistical access to the base. They also would have an advantage of being able to be at high altitude, such as on top of mountains.  In an alternate concept, the base station could be a tower, forming a space elevator which comprises both a compression tower close to the surface, and a tether structure at higher altitudes.<ref name=\"JBIS1999\"/> Combining a compression structure with a tension structure would reduce loads from the atmosphere at the Earth end of the tether, and reduce the distance into the Earth's gravity field the cable needs to extend, and thus reduce the critical strength-to-density requirements for the cable material, all other design factors being equal.\n\n===Cable===\n[[File:Kohlenstoffnanoroehre Animation.gif|thumb|right|[[Carbon nanotubes]] are one of the candidates for a cable material]]\nA space elevator cable would need to carry its own weight as well as the additional weight of climbers. The required strength of the cable would vary along its length. This is because at various points it would have to carry the weight of the cable below, or provide a downward force to retain the cable and counterweight above. Maximum tension on a space elevator cable would be at geosynchronous altitude so the cable would have to be thickest there and taper carefully as it approaches Earth. Any potential cable design may be characterized by the taper factor \u2013 the ratio between the cable's radius at geosynchronous altitude and at the Earth's surface.<ref name=NASA97029>{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.nasa.gov/assets/pdf/techreports/1997/nas-97-029.pdf\n|title=NAS-97-029: NASA Applications of Molecular Nanotechnology\n|author=Globus, Al\n|display-authors=etal\n|publisher=NASA\n|accessdate=September 27, 2008|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nThe cable would need to be made of a material with a large [[specific strength|tensile strength/density ratio]]. For example, the Edwards space elevator design assumes a cable material with a specific strength of at least 100,000&nbsp;kN/(kg/m).<ref name=Edwards/> This value takes into consideration the entire weight of the space elevator. An untapered space elevator cable would need a material capable of sustaining a length of {{convert|4,960|km|mi|sp=us}} of its own weight ''at [[sea level]]'' to reach a [[geostationary]] altitude of {{convert|35786|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} without yielding.<ref>This 4,960 km \"escape length\" (calculated by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] in 1979) is much shorter than the actual distance spanned because [[Centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]]s increase (and gravity decreases) dramatically with height: {{cite web|url= http://www.islandone.org/LEOBiblio/CLARK2.HTM|title = The space elevator: 'thought experiment', or key to the universe?''|last = Clarke|first = A.C.|year = 1979}}</ref> Therefore, a material with very high strength and lightness is needed.\n\nFor comparison, metals like titanium, steel or aluminium alloys have [[specific strength|breaking lengths]] of only 20\u201330&nbsp;km. Modern [[Man-made fibers|fibre]] materials such as [[kevlar]], [[fibreglass]] and [[Carbon fiber|carbon/graphite fibre]] have breaking lengths of 100\u2013400&nbsp;km. Nanoengineered materials such as [[carbon nanotubes]] and, more recently discovered, [[graphene]] ribbons (perfect two-dimensional sheets of carbon) are expected to have breaking lengths of 5000\u20136000&nbsp;km at sea level, and also are able to conduct electrical power.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nFor a space elevator on Earth, with its comparatively high gravity, the cable material would need to be stronger and lighter than currently available materials.<ref name=\"Huff.3353697\" /> For this reason, there has been a focus on the development of new materials that meet the demanding specific strength requirement. For high specific strength, carbon has advantages because it is only the 6th element in the [[periodic table]]. Carbon has comparatively few of the [[nucleons|protons and neutrons]] which contribute most of the dead weight of any material. Most of the interatomic [[Chemical bond|bonding forces]] of any element are contributed by only the [[Valence electron|outer few]] electrons. For carbon, the strength and stability of those bonds is high compared to the mass of the atom. The challenge in using carbon nanotubes remains to extend to macroscopic sizes the production of such material that are still perfect on the microscopic scale (as microscopic [[Crystallographic defects|defects]] are most responsible for material weakness).<ref name=\"Huff.3353697\">{{cite web |first=Jillian |last=Scharr |title=Space Elevators On Hold At Least Until Stronger Materials Are Available, Experts Say |work=Huffington Post |date=29 May 2013 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/space-elevators-stronger-materials_n_3353697.html }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"pop.15185070\">{{cite web |last=Feltman |first=R. |title=Why Don't We Have Space Elevators? |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=7 March 2013 |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/space/nasa/why-dont-we-have-space-elevators-15185070 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"extreme.176625\">{{cite news |last=Templeton |first=Graham |url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/176625-60000-miles-up-geostationary-space-elevator-could-be-built-by-2035-says-new-study |title=60,000 miles up: Space elevator could be built by 2035, says new study |work=Extreme Tech |date=6 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-04-19 }}</ref> As of 2014, carbon nanotube technology allowed growing tubes up to a few tenths of meters.<ref>{{cite journal| first=X.| last=Wang| title=Fabrication of Ultralong and Electrically Uniform Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes on Clean Substrates |volume=9 |pages=3137\u20133141| year=2009| doi=10.1021/nl901260b| journal=Nano Letters| last2=Li| first2=Q. |last3=Xie| first3=J.| last4=Jin|first4=Z.| last5=Wang |first5=J.| last6=Li| first6=Y.| last7=Jiang| first7=K.| last8=Fan| first8=S.| issue=9| pmid=19650638| bibcode=2009NanoL...9.3137W\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:SpaceElevatorAnchor.jpg||thumb|250px|right|A seagoing anchor station would also act as a deep-water [[seaport]].]]\n\nIn 2014, [[carbon nanothread|diamond nanothreads]] were first synthesized.<ref name=SCIAM_DN>http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/liquid-benzene-squeezed-to-form-diamond-nanothreads/</ref>  Since they have strength properties similar to carbon nanotubes, diamond nanothreads were quickly seen as candidate cable material as well.<ref name=Xtech_DN>http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/190691-new-diamond-nanothreads-could-be-the-key-material-for-building-a-space-elevator</ref>\n\n===Climbers===\n[[Image:SpaceElevatorInClouds.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A conceptual drawing of a space elevator climber ascending through the clouds.]]\n\nA space elevator cannot be an elevator in the typical sense (with moving cables) due to the need for the cable to be significantly wider at the center than at the tips. While various designs employing moving cables have been proposed, most cable designs call for the \"elevator\" to climb up a stationary cable.\n\nClimbers cover a wide range of designs. On elevator designs whose cables are planar ribbons, most propose to use pairs of rollers to hold the cable with friction.\n\nClimbers would need to be paced at optimal timings so as to minimize cable stress and oscillations and to maximize throughput. Lighter climbers could be sent up more often, with several going up at the same time. This would increase throughput somewhat, but would lower the mass of each individual payload.<ref name=\"LangGTOSS\" >Lang, David D.

A payload released at this point would go into a highly eccentric elliptical orbit, staying just barely clear from atmospheric reentry, with the [[periapsis]] at the same altitude as LEO and the [[apoapsis]] at the release height. With increasing release height the orbit would become less eccentric as both periapsis and apoapsis increase, becoming circular at geostationary level.<ref name=\"Gassend_fall\">\n{{cite web\n|first=Blaise\n|last=Gassend\n|title=Falling Climbers\n|url=http://gassend.net/spaceelevator/falling-climbers/index.html\n|accessdate=December 16, 2013\n}}</ref><ref name=Skyway_to_LEO>\n{{cite web\n|publisher=Endless Skyway|title=Space elevator to low orbit?\n|url=http://www.endlessskyway.com/2010/05/space-elevator-to-low-orbit.html\n|accessdate=December 16, 2013\n}}</ref>\nWhen the payload has reached GEO, the horizontal speed is exactly the speed of a circular orbit at that level, so that if released, it would remain adjacent to that point on the cable.  The payload can also continue climbing further up the cable beyond GEO, allowing it to obtain higher speed at jettison.  If released from 100,000&nbsp;km, the payload would have enough speed to reach the asteroid belt.<ref name=PhaseII />\n\nAs a payload is lifted up a space elevator, it would gain not only altitude, but horizontal speed (angular momentum) as well. The angular momentum is taken from the Earth's rotation. As the climber ascends, it is initially moving slower than each successive part of cable it is moving on to. This is the [[Coriolis force]]: the climber \"drags\" (westward) on the cable, as it climbs, and slightly decreases the Earth's rotation speed. The opposite process would occur for descending payloads: the cable is tilted eastwards, thus slightly increasing Earth's rotation speed.\n\nThe overall effect of the <!--n.b. the elevator is in a non inertial reference frame, so centrifugal is correct--->centrifugal force acting on the cable would cause it to constantly try to return to the energetically favorable vertical orientation, so after an object has been lifted on the cable, the counterweight would swing back towards the vertical like an inverted pendulum.<ref name=\"LangGTOSS\"/> Space elevators and their loads would be designed so that the center of mass is always well-enough above the level of geostationary orbit<ref>[http://gassend.net/spaceelevator/center-of-mass/index.html \"Why the Space Elevator's Center of Mass is not at GEO\" by Blaise Gassend].

A long cable would be dropped \"downward\" (toward Earth) and would be balanced by a mass being dropped \"upward\" (away from Earth) for the whole system to remain on the geosynchronous orbit. Earlier designs imagined the balancing mass to be another cable (with counterweight) extending upward, with the main spool remaining at the original geosynchronous orbit level. Most current designs elevate the spool itself as the main cable is paid out, a simpler process. When the lower end of the cable is so long as to reach the surface of the Earth (at the equator), it would be anchored. Once anchored, the center of mass would be elevated more (by adding mass at the upper end or by paying out more cable). This would add more tension to the whole cable, which could then be used as an elevator cable.\n\nOne plan for construction uses conventional rockets to place a \"minimum size\" initial seed cable of only 19,800&nbsp;kg.<ref name=Edwards/> This first very small ribbon would be adequate to support the first 619&nbsp;kg climber. The first 207 climbers would carry up and attach more cable to the original, increasing its cross section area and widening the initial ribbon to about 160&nbsp;mm wide at its widest point. The result would be a 750-ton cable with a lift capacity of 20 tons per climber.\n\n===Safety issues and construction challenges===\n{{Main article|Space elevator safety}}\nFor early systems, transit times from the surface to the level of geosynchronous orbit would be about five days. On these early systems, the time spent moving through the [[Van Allen radiation belts]] would be enough that passengers would need to be protected from radiation by shielding, which would add mass to the climber and decrease payload.<ref name=firstfloor>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10520 |title=Space elevators: 'First floor, deadly radiation!' |accessdate=January 2, 2010 |date=November 13, 2006|work=New Scientist |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd.}}</ref>\n\nA space elevator would present a navigational hazard, both to aircraft and spacecraft. Aircraft could be diverted by [[air-traffic control]] restrictions. All objects in stable orbits that have [[perigee]] below the maximum altitude of the cable that are not synchronous with the cable would impact the cable eventually, unless avoiding action is taken. One potential solution proposed by Edwards is to use a movable anchor (a sea anchor) to allow the tether to \"dodge\" any space debris large enough to track.<ref name=Edwards/>\n\nImpacts by space objects such as meteoroids, micrometeorites and orbiting man-made debris, pose another design constraint on the cable. A cable would need to be designed to maneuver out of the way of debris, or absorb impacts of small debris without breaking.\n\n===Economics===\n{{Main article|Space elevator economics}}\nWith a space elevator, materials might be sent into orbit at a fraction of the current cost.

Space Elevator Architectures and Roadmaps, Lulu.com Publishers 2015</ref>\n\n==Related concepts==\nThe conventional current concept of a \"Space Elevator\" has evolved from a static compressive structure reaching to the level of GEO, to the modern baseline idea of a static tensile structure anchored to the ground and extending to well above the level of GEO. In the current usage by practitioners (and in this article), a \"Space Elevator\" means the Tsiolkovsky-Artsutanov-Pearson type as considered by the International Space Elevator Consortium. This conventional type is a static structure fixed to the ground and extending into space high enough that cargo can climb the structure up from the ground to a level where simple release will put the cargo into an [[orbit]].<ref>\"CLIMB: The Journal of the International Space Elevator Consortium\", Volume 1, Number 1, December 2011, This journal is cited as an example of what is generally considered to be under the term \"Space Elevator\" by the international community. [http://www.isec.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=28&Itemid=31]</ref>\n\nSome concepts related to this modern baseline are not usually termed a \"Space Elevator\", but are similar in some way and are sometimes termed \"Space Elevator\" by their proponents. For example, [[Hans Moravec]] published an article in 1977 called \"A Non-Synchronous Orbital [[Skyhook (structure)|Skyhook]]\" describing a concept using a rotating cable.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Moravec, Hans P. |title=A Non-Synchronous Orbital Skyhook|journal=Journal of the Astronautical Sciences|volume=25|date= October\u2013December 1977|bibcode=1977JAnSc..25..307M|pages=307\u2013322}}</ref> The rotation speed would exactly match the orbital speed in such a way that the tip velocity at the lowest point was zero compared to the object to be \"elevated\". It would dynamically grapple and then \"elevate\" high flying objects to orbit or low orbiting objects to higher orbit.\n\nThe original concept envisioned by Tsiolkovsky was a compression structure, a concept similar to an [[Radio masts and towers|aerial mast]]. While such structures might reach [[Karman line|space]] (100&nbsp;km, 62&nbsp;mi), they are unlikely to reach geostationary orbit. The concept of a Tsiolkovsky tower combined with a classic space elevator cable (reaching above the level of GEO) has been suggested.<ref name=\"JBIS1999\"/>  Other ideas use very tall compressive towers to reduce the demands on launch vehicles.<ref name=TorontoProposal />  The vehicle is \"elevated\" up the tower, which may extend as high as [[Karman line|above the atmosphere]], and is launched from the top.  Such a tall tower to access near-space altitudes of {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} has been proposed by various researchers.<ref name=TorontoProposal>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2009.02.018|url=http://pi.library.yorku.ca/dspace/bitstream/handle/10315/2587/AA_3369_Quine_Space_Elevator_Final_2009.pdf|bibcode=2009AcAau..65..365Q|title=A free-standing space elevator structure: A practical alternative to the space tether|year=2009|last1=Quine|first1=B.M.|last2=Seth|first2=R.K.|last3=Zhu|first3=Z.H.|journal=Acta Astronautica|volume=65|issue=3\u20134|page=365}}</ref><ref name=\"landis1996\">Landis, Geoffrey, \"Compression Structures for Earth Launch,\" 7th Advanced Space Propulsion Workshop, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, April 9\u201311, 1996; also [http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.1998-3737 paper AIAA-98-3737], 24th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference, 1998.</ref><ref>Hjelmstad, Keith, [http://hieroglyph.asu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hjelmstad-on-Stephenson-Structural-Design-of-the-Tall-Tower.pdf \"Structural Design of the Tall Tower\"], ''Hieroglyph'', 11/30/2013.
