When certain organic materials are heated, they undergo [[thermal decomposition]] and release flammable gases.  Flashover occurs when the majority of the exposed surfaces in a space are heated to their [[autoignition temperature]] and emit flammable gases (see also [[flash point]]). Flashover normally occurs at {{convert|500|C}} or {{convert|1100|F|C|order=flip|sigfig=2}} for ordinary combustibles, and an incident heat flux at floor level of {{convert|20|kW/m2}}.\n\nAn example of flashover is ignition of a piece of [[furniture]] in a domestic room.  The fire involving the initial piece of furniture can produce a layer of hot [[smoke]] which spreads across the ceiling in the room. The hot buoyant smoke layer grows in depth, as it is bounded by the walls of the room. The [[thermal radiation|radiated heat]] from this layer heats the surfaces of the directly exposed combustible materials in the room, causing them to give off flammable gases via [[pyrolysis]].  When the temperatures of the evolved gases become high enough, these gases will ignite throughout their extent.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fireengineering.com/articles/2010/06/kiurski-flashover.html | title=Understanding Flashover | work=Fire Engineering | date=June 22, 2010 | accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\nThe original Swedish terminology related to the term 'flashover' has been altered in its translation to conform with current European and North American accepted [scientific] definitions as follows:\n* A '''lean flashover''' (sometimes called '''[[rollover (fire)|rollover]]''') is the ignition of the gas layer under the ceiling, leading to total involvement of the compartment.  The fuel/air ratio is at the bottom region of the flammability range (''i.e.'' lean).\n* A '''rich flashover''' occurs when the flammable gases are ignited while at the upper region of the flammability range (''i.e.'' rich). This can happen in rooms where the fire subsided because of lack of oxygen. The ignition source can be a [[smouldering]] object, or the stirring up of embers by the air track. Such an event is known as {{'}}'''[[backdraft]]'''{{'}}.\n* A '''delayed flashover''' occurs when the colder gray smoke cloud ignites after congregating outside of its room of origin. This results in a volatile situation, and if the ignition occurs at the ideal mixture, the result can be a violent '''[[wiktionary:smoke explosion|smoke gas explosion]]'''. This is referred to as '''smoke explosion''' or '''fire gas ignition''' depending on the severity of the combustion process.\n* A '''hot rich flashover''' occurs when the hot smoke with flammable gas ratio above the upper limit of flammability range and temperature higher than the ignition temperature leaves the compartment. Upon dilution with air it can spontaneously ignite, and the resultant flame can propagate back into the compartment, resulting in an event similar to a rich flashover. The common definition of this process is known as '''auto-ignition''' which is another form of '''fire gas ignition'''.\n\n==Dangers==\n\nFlashover is one of the most-feared phenomena among [[firefighter]]s. Firefighters are taught  to recognize rollovers and flashovers and avoid backdrafts. For example, they have certain routines for opening a closed door in a building on fire, such as positioning oneself adjacent to the door instead of in front of it, and to be ready to fight any advent of shooting flames.\n\n==Indicators==\n\n{{Refimprove|section|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe following are some of the signs that firefighters are looking for when they attempt to determine whether a flashover is likely to occur.\n* The fire is in a ventilated compartment, so there is no shortage of oxygen in the room.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n* The [[Glossary of firefighting#N|neutral plane]] is moving down towards the floor. In this situation, a flashover is plausible.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n* All directly exposed combustible materials are showing signs of [[pyrolysis]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n* \"[[Rollover (fire)|Rollover]]\" or tongues of fire appear (known as \"Angel Fingers\" to firefighters).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n* There is a rapid buildup of heat given off by the rapidly burning (i.e., deflagrating) gases. This is generally the best indication of a flashover.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nFirefighters memorize a chant to help remember these during training: \"Thick dark smoke, high heat, rollover, free burning.\"{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe colour of the smoke is often considered, as well, but there is no connection between the colour of the smoke and the risk of flashovers. Traditionally, black, dense smoke was considered particularly dangerous, but history shows this to be an unreliable indicator. For example, there was a fire in a [[rubber]] [[mattress]] [[factory]] in [[London]] in 1975 which produced white smoke. The white smoke wasn't considered dangerous, so firefighters decided to [[Ventilation (firefighting)|ventilate]], which caused a smoke explosion and killed two firefighters. The white smoke from the pyrolysis of the rubber turned out to be extremely flammable.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|2}}\n* [[Air Canada Flight 797]]\n* [[Backdraft]]\n* [[Charleston Sofa Super Store fire]]\n* [[Firestorm]]\n* [[Kilbirnie Street fire]], 1972\n* [[King's Cross fire]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.metacafe.com/watch/682670/from_living_room_to_inferno_in_under_2_minutes/ Living Room Flashover Video]\n* [http://www.firetactics.com/FLASHOVER.htm Rapid Fire Progress & Flashover related fire development]\n* [http://www.firetactics.com/SHAN%20RAFFEL%20IFE.htm Realistic hot fire training to deal safely with flashover and backdraft]\n* [http://www.fireflash.nl/?lang=en Flashover / Backdraft training]\n* [https://www.ffb.kit.edu Photo and video of a flashover in a living room (Forschungsstelle f\u00fcr Brandschutztechnik (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology - KIT)]\n* [http://www.flashover-hr.com Flashover training Croatia]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO3zQXx4gIo Flashover during house fire in Baltimore, MD.
