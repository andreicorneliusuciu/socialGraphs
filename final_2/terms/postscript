In a book or essay, a more carefully composed addition (e.g., for a second edition) is called an [[afterword]]. The word \"postscript\" has, poetically, been used to refer to any sort of addendum to some main work, even if it is not attached to a main work, as in [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]]'s book titled ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]].'' Sometimes, when additional points are made after the first postscript, abbreviations such as PSS (post-super-scriptum), PPS (postquam-post-scriptum) and PPPS (post-post-post-scriptum, and so on, ''[[ad infinitum]]'') are used, though only PPS has somewhat common usage.\n\n== Historical examples ==\n\nIn a letter written by [[Thomas Jefferson]] on February 14, 1815, the former third President of the United States and main author of the [[Declaration of Independence]], used the P.S. abbreviation to add a lengthy postscript, which he dated February 26.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3675951/Rare-Thomas-Jefferson-letter-discovered-family-s-attic-railing-against-British-goes-sale-325-000.html  |title=Rare Thomas Jefferson letter discovered in family's attic railing against the British goes on sale for $325,000  |last=Graham  |first=Regina F.  |date=July 5, 2016  |website=DailyMail.co.uk  |publisher=Daily Mail  |accessdate=July 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n\n* [[Publishing]]\n* [[Afterword]]\n* [[Postface]]\n* [[Addendum#Books|Appendix]]\n* [[Addendum]]\n* ''[[Nota bene]]''\n* ''[[P.S.
