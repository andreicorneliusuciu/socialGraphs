The term \"laser\" originated as an [[acronym]] for \"'''light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation'''\".<ref name=\"Gould1959\" /><ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 15, 2008|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/laser|title=laser |publisher=[[Reference.com]] }}</ref>  The first laser was built in 1960 by [[Theodore H. Maiman]] at [[Hughes Research Laboratories]], based on theoretical work by [[Charles Hard Townes]] and [[Arthur Leonard Schawlow]]. A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light [[coherence (physics)|''coherently'']]. [[Spatial coherence]] allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling applications such as [[laser cutting]] and [[Photolithography#Light sources|lithography]]. Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances ([[collimated light|collimation]]), enabling applications such as [[laser pointer]]s. Lasers can also have high [[temporal coherence]], which allows them to emit light with a very narrow [[frequency spectrum|spectrum]], i.e., they can emit a single color of light. Temporal coherence can be used to produce [[ultrashort pulse|pulses]] of light as short as a [[femtosecond]].\n\nAmong their many applications, lasers are used in [[optical disk drive]]s, [[laser printer]]s, and [[barcode scanner]]s; DNA sequencing instruments, [[fiber-optic communication|fiber-optic]] and [[free-space optical communication]]; [[laser surgery]] and skin treatments; cutting and [[welding]] materials; military and [[law enforcement]] devices for marking targets and [[Laser rangefinder#Military|measuring range]] and speed; and [[laser lighting display]]s in entertainment.\n\n== Fundamentals ==\n[[File:Four Lasers Over Paranal.jpg|thumb|Modern telescopes use laser technologies to compensate for the blurring effect of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web|title=Four Lasers Over Paranal|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1618a/|website=www.eso.org|publisher=European Southern Observatory|accessdate=9 May 2016}}</ref>]]\nLasers are distinguished from other light sources by their [[coherence (physics)|coherence]]. Spatial coherence is typically expressed through the output being a narrow beam, which is [[Gaussian beam|diffraction-limited]]. Laser beams can be focused to very tiny spots, achieving a very high [[irradiance]], or they can have very low divergence in order to concentrate their power at a great distance.\n\nTemporal (or longitudinal) coherence implies a [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] wave at a single frequency whose phase is correlated over a relatively great distance (the [[coherence length]]) along the beam.<ref>''Conceptual physics'', Paul Hewitt, 2002</ref> A beam produced by a thermal or other incoherent light source has an instantaneous amplitude and [[phase (waves)|phase]] that vary randomly with respect to time and position,  thus having a short coherence length.\n\nLasers are characterized according to their [[wavelength]] in a vacuum.  Most \"single wavelength\" lasers actually produce radiation in several ''modes'' having slightly differing frequencies (wavelengths), often not in a single polarization. Although temporal coherence implies monochromaticity, there are lasers that emit a broad spectrum of light or emit different wavelengths of light simultaneously. There are some lasers that are not single spatial mode and consequently have light beams that [[Beam divergence|diverge]] more than is required by the [[diffraction limit]]. However, all such devices are classified as \"lasers\" based on their method of producing light, i.e., stimulated emission. Lasers are employed in applications where light of the required spatial or temporal coherence could not be produced using simpler technologies.\n\n=== Terminology ===\n[[File:Laser play.jpg|thumb|Laser beams in fog, reflected on a car windshield]]\nThe word ''laser'' started as an [[acronym]] for \"light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\". In modern usage, the term \"light\" includes electromagnetic radiation of any frequency, not only [[visible light]], hence the terms ''infrared laser'', ''ultraviolet laser'', ''X-ray laser'', ''[[gamma-ray laser]]'', and so on. Because the microwave predecessor of the laser, the [[maser]], was developed first, devices of this sort operating at microwave and [[Radio frequency|radio frequencies]] are referred to as \"masers\" rather than \"microwave lasers\" or \"radio lasers\". In the early technical literature, especially at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]], the laser was called an '''optical maser'''; this term is now obsolete.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = Schawlow and Townes invent the laser\n  | publisher = Lucent Technologies\n  |year=1998\n  | url = http://www.bell-labs.com/about/history/laser/\n  | accessdate =October 24, 2006\n  | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017080654/http://www.bell-labs.com/about/history/laser/\n  | archivedate=October 17, 2006}}</ref>\n\nA laser that produces light by itself is technically an optical oscillator rather than an [[optical amplifier]] as suggested by the acronym.

Light of a specific wavelength that passes through the gain medium is amplified (increases in power).\n\nFor the gain medium to amplify light, it needs to be supplied with energy in a process called [[laser pumping|pumping]]. The energy is typically supplied as an electric current or as light at a different wavelength. Pump light may be provided by a [[Xenon flash lamp|flash lamp]] or by another laser.\n\nThe most common type of laser uses feedback from an [[optical cavity]]\u2014a pair of mirrors on either end of the gain medium. Light bounces back and forth between the mirrors, passing through the gain medium and being amplified each time. Typically one of the two mirrors, the [[output coupler]], is partially transparent. Some of the light escapes through this mirror. Depending on the design of the cavity (whether the mirrors are flat or [[curved mirror|curved]]), the light coming out of the laser may spread out or form a narrow [[light beam|beam]]. In analogy to [[electronic oscillator]]s, this device is sometimes called a ''laser oscillator''.\n\nMost practical lasers contain additional elements that affect properties of the emitted light, such as the polarization,  wavelength, and shape of the beam.\n\n== Laser physics ==\n{{See also|Laser science}}\n[[Electron]]s and how they interact with [[electromagnetic field]]s are important in our understanding of [[chemistry]] and [[physics]].\n\n=== Stimulated emission ===\n{{Main|Stimulated emission}}\nIn the [[Classical electromagnetism|classical view]], the energy of an electron orbiting an atomic nucleus is larger for orbits further from the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of an [[atom]]. However, quantum mechanical effects force electrons to take on discrete positions in [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]]. Thus, electrons are found in specific energy levels of an atom, two of which are shown below:\n\n[[File:Stimulated Emission.svg|center|550px]]\n\nWhen an electron absorbs energy either from light ([[photon]]s) or heat ([[phonon]]s), it receives that incident quantum of energy. But transitions are only allowed in between discrete energy levels such as the two shown above.\nThis leads to [[emission line]]s and [[Spectral line|absorption lines]].\n\nWhen an electron is [[Excited state|excited]] from a lower to a higher energy level, it will not stay that way forever.\nAn electron in an excited state may decay to a lower energy state which is not occupied, according to a particular time constant characterizing that transition. When such an electron decays without external influence, emitting a photon, that is called \"[[spontaneous emission]]\". The phase associated with the photon that is emitted is random. A material with many atoms in such an excited state may thus result in [[radiation]] which is very spectrally limited (centered around one [[wavelength]] of light), but the individual photons would have no common phase relationship and would emanate in random directions. This is the mechanism of [[fluorescence]] and [[thermal emission]].\n\nAn external electromagnetic field at a frequency associated with a transition can affect the quantum mechanical state of the atom. As the electron in the atom makes a transition between two stationary states (neither of which shows a dipole field), it enters a transition state which does have a dipole field, and which acts like a small electric [[dipole]], and this dipole oscillates at a characteristic frequency. In response to the external electric field at this frequency, the probability of the atom entering this transition state is greatly increased. Thus, the rate of transitions between two stationary states is enhanced beyond that due to spontaneous emission. Such a transition to the higher state is called [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], and it destroys an incident photon (the photon's energy goes into powering the increased energy of the higher state). A transition from the higher to a lower energy state, however, produces an additional photon; this is the process of '''stimulated emission'''.\n\n=== Gain medium and cavity ===\n[[File:Laser DSC09088.JPG|thumb|250px|A [[helium\u2013neon laser]] demonstration at the [[Kastler-Brossel Laboratory]] at [[Paris VI|Univ. Paris 6]]. The pink-orange glow running through the center of the tube is from the electric discharge which produces incoherent light, just as in a neon tube. This glowing plasma is excited and then acts as the [[active laser medium|gain medium]] through which the internal beam passes, as it is reflected between the two mirrors. Laser radiation output through the front mirror can be seen to produce a tiny (about 1&nbsp;mm in diameter) intense spot on the screen, to the right. Although it is a deep and pure red color, spots of laser light are so intense that cameras are typically overexposed and distort their color.]]\n[[File:Helium neon laser spectrum.svg|thumb|upright|Spectrum of a helium neon laser illustrating its very high spectral purity (limited by the measuring apparatus). The 0.002&nbsp;nm bandwidth of the lasing medium is well over 10,000 times narrower than the spectral width of a light-emitting diode (whose spectrum is shown '''[[:File:Red-YellowGreen-Blue LED spectra.png|here]]''' for comparison), with the bandwidth of a single longitudinal mode being much narrower still.]]\n\nThe gain medium is put into an [[excited state]] by an external source of energy. In most lasers this medium consists of a population of atoms which have been excited into such a state by means of an outside light source, or an electrical field which supplies energy for atoms to absorb and be transformed into their excited states.\n\nThe gain medium of a laser is normally a material of controlled purity, size, concentration, and shape, which amplifies the beam by the process of stimulated emission described above. This material can be of any [[state of matter|state]]: gas, liquid, solid, or [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The gain medium absorbs pump energy, which raises some electrons into higher-energy (\"[[excited state|excited]]\") [[quantum state]]s. Particles can interact with light by either absorbing or emitting photons. Emission can be spontaneous or stimulated. In the latter case, the photon is emitted in the same direction as the light that is passing by. When the number of particles in one excited state exceeds the number of particles in some lower-energy state, [[population inversion]] is achieved and the amount of stimulated emission due to light that passes through is larger than the amount of absorption. Hence, the light is amplified. By itself, this makes an [[optical amplifier]]. When an optical amplifier is placed inside a resonant optical cavity, one obtains a laser oscillator.<ref>{{cite book |first = Anthony E. |last=Siegman |year=1986 |title=Lasers |publisher=University Science Books |isbn= 0-935702-11-3 |page=4}}</ref>\n\nIn a few situations it is possible to obtain lasing with only a single pass of EM radiation through the gain medium, and this produces a laser beam without any need for a resonant or reflective cavity (see for example [[nitrogen laser]]).<ref name=\"Light and Its Uses, Nitrogen Laser\">{{cite book\n  |title=Light and Its Uses\n  |chapter=Nitrogen Laser\n  |publisher=Scientific American\n  |date=June 1974\n  |isbn=0-7167-1185-0\n  |pages=40\u201343\n  |ref=Light and Its Uses\n}}</ref> Thus, reflection in a resonant cavity is usually required for a laser, but is not absolutely necessary.\n\nThe optical [[resonator]] is sometimes referred to as an \"optical cavity\", but this is a misnomer: lasers use open resonators as opposed to the literal cavity that would be employed at microwave frequencies in a [[maser]].\nThe resonator typically consists of two mirrors between which a coherent beam of light travels in both directions, reflecting back on itself so that an average photon will pass through the gain medium repeatedly before it is emitted from the output aperture or lost to diffraction or absorption.\nIf the gain (amplification) in the medium is larger than the resonator losses, then the power of the recirculating light can rise [[exponential growth|exponentially]]. But each stimulated emission event returns an atom from its excited state to the ground state, reducing the gain of the medium. With increasing beam power the net gain (gain minus loss) reduces to unity and the gain medium is said to be saturated. In a continuous wave (CW) laser, the balance of pump power against gain saturation and cavity losses produces an equilibrium value of the laser power inside the cavity; this equilibrium determines the operating point of the laser. If the applied pump power is too small, the gain will never be sufficient to overcome the resonator losses, and laser light will not be produced. The minimum pump power needed to begin laser action is called the ''[[lasing threshold]]''. The gain medium will amplify any photons passing through it, regardless of direction; but only the photons in a [[spatial mode]] supported by the resonator will pass more than once through the medium and receive substantial amplification.\n\n=== The light emitted ===\nThe light generated by stimulated emission is very similar to the input signal in terms of wavelength, [[phase (waves)|phase]], and polarization. This gives laser light its characteristic coherence, and allows it to maintain the uniform polarization and often monochromaticity established by the optical cavity design.\n\nThe beam in the cavity and the output beam of the laser, when traveling in free space (or a homogeneous medium) rather than waveguides (as in an [[optical fiber]] laser), can be approximated as a [[Gaussian beam]] in most lasers; such beams exhibit the minimum divergence for a given diameter. However some high power lasers may be multimode, with the [[transverse mode]]s often approximated using [[Hermite polynomials|Hermite]]\u2013[[Gaussian function|Gaussian]] or [[Laguerre polynomials|Laguerre]]-Gaussian functions. It has been shown that unstable laser resonators (not used in most lasers) produce fractal shaped beams.<ref>G. P. Karman, G. S. McDonald, G. H. C. New, J. P. Woerdman, \"[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v402/n6758/abs/402138a0.html Laser Optics: Fractal modes in unstable resonators]\", ''Nature'', Vol. 402, 138, November 11, 1999.</ref> Near the beam \"waist\" (or [[focus (optics)|focal region]]) it is highly ''[[collimated light|collimated]]'': the wavefronts are planar, normal to the direction of propagation, with no [[beam divergence]] at that point. However, due to [[diffraction]], that can only remain true well within the [[Rayleigh range]]. The beam of a single transverse mode (gaussian beam) laser eventually diverges at an angle which varies inversely with the beam diameter, as required by [[diffraction]] theory. Thus, the \"pencil beam\" directly generated by a common [[helium\u2013neon laser]] would spread out to a size of perhaps 500 kilometers when shone on the Moon (from the distance of the earth). On the other hand, the light from a [[semiconductor laser]] typically exits the tiny crystal with a large divergence: up to 50\u00b0. However even such a divergent beam can be transformed into a similarly collimated beam by means of a [[lens (optics)|lens]] system, as is always included, for instance, in a [[laser pointer]] whose light originates from a [[laser diode]]. That is possible due to the light being of a single spatial mode. This unique property of laser light, [[spatial coherence]], cannot be replicated using standard light sources (except by discarding most of the light) as can be appreciated by comparing the beam from a flashlight (torch) or spotlight to that of almost any laser.\n\n=== Quantum vs. classical emission processes ===\nThe mechanism of producing radiation in a laser relies on [[stimulated emission]], where energy is extracted from a transition in an atom or molecule. This is a quantum phenomenon discovered by [[Einstein]] who derived the relationship between the [[Spontaneous emission#Rate of spontaneous emission|A coefficient]] describing spontaneous emission and the [[Stimulated emission#Mathematical model|B coefficient]] which applies to absorption and stimulated emission. However, in the case of the [[free electron laser]], atomic energy levels are not involved; it appears that the operation of this rather exotic device can be explained without reference to [[quantum mechanics]].\n\n== Continuous and pulsed modes of operation ==\n[[File:Moon clementine lidar.jpg|thumb|[[Lidar]] measurements of lunar topography made by [[Clementine (spacecraft)|Clementine]] mission.]]\n[[File:Laserlink hss46.jpg|thumb|Laserlink [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point to point]] optical wireless network]]\n[[File:MESSENGER - MLA.jpg|thumb|upright|Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) of the [[MESSENGER]] spacecraft]]\nA laser can be classified as operating in either continuous or pulsed mode, depending on whether the power output is essentially continuous over time or whether its output takes the form of pulses of light on one or another time scale. Of course even a laser whose output is normally continuous can be intentionally turned on and off at some rate in order to create pulses of light. When the modulation rate is on time scales much slower than the [[Q factor#Optical systems|cavity lifetime]] and the time period over which energy can be stored in the lasing medium or pumping mechanism, then it is still classified as a \"modulated\" or \"pulsed\" continuous wave laser. Most laser diodes used in communication systems fall in that category.\n\n=== Continuous wave operation ===\nSome applications of lasers depend on a beam whose output power is constant over time. Such a laser is known as ''[[continuous wave]]'' (''CW''). Many types of lasers can be made to operate in continuous wave mode to satisfy such an application. Many of these lasers actually lase in several longitudinal modes at the same time, and beats between the slightly different optical frequencies of those oscillations will in fact produce amplitude variations on time scales shorter than the round-trip time (the reciprocal of the [[Free spectral range#Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot interferometer|frequency spacing]] between modes), typically a few nanoseconds or less. In most cases these lasers are still termed \"continuous wave\" as their output power is steady when averaged over any longer time periods, with the very high frequency power variations having little or no impact in the intended application. (However the term is not applied to [[Mode-locking|mode-locked]] lasers, where the ''intention'' is to create very short pulses at the rate of the round-trip time).\n\nFor continuous wave operation it is required for the population inversion of the gain medium to be continually replenished by a steady pump source. In some lasing media this is impossible. In some other lasers it would require pumping the laser at a very high continuous power level which would be impractical or destroy the laser by producing excessive heat. Such lasers cannot be run in CW mode.\n\n=== Pulsed operation ===\nPulsed operation of lasers refers to any laser not classified as continuous wave, so that the optical power appears in pulses of some duration at some repetition rate. This encompasses a wide range of technologies addressing a number of different motivations. Some lasers are pulsed simply because they cannot be run in [[#Continuous wave operation|continuous]] mode.\n\nIn other cases the application requires the production of pulses having as large an energy as possible. Since the pulse energy is equal to the average power divided by the repetition rate, this goal can sometimes be satisfied by lowering the rate of pulses so that more energy can be built up in between pulses. In [[laser ablation]], for example, a small volume of material at the surface of a work piece can be evaporated if it is heated in a very short time, while supplying the energy gradually would allow for the heat to be absorbed into the bulk of the piece, never attaining a sufficiently high temperature at a particular point.\n\nOther applications rely on the peak pulse power (rather than the energy in the pulse), especially in order to obtain [[nonlinear optical]] effects. For a given pulse energy, this requires creating pulses of the shortest possible duration utilizing techniques such as [[Q-switching]].\n\nThe optical bandwidth of a pulse cannot be narrower than the reciprocal of the pulse width. In the case of extremely short pulses, that implies lasing over a considerable bandwidth, quite contrary to the very narrow bandwidths typical of CW lasers. The lasing medium in some ''dye lasers'' and ''vibronic solid-state lasers'' produces optical gain over a wide bandwidth, making a laser possible which can thus generate pulses of light as short as a few [[femtoseconds]] (10<sup>\u221215</sup> s).\n\n==== Q-switching ====\n{{Main|Q-switching}}\n\nIn a Q-switched laser, the population inversion is allowed to build up by introducing loss inside the resonator which exceeds the gain of the medium; this can also be described as a reduction of the quality factor or 'Q' of the cavity. Then, after the pump energy stored in the laser medium has approached the maximum possible level, the introduced loss mechanism (often an electro- or acousto-optical element) is rapidly removed (or that occurs by itself in a passive device), allowing lasing to begin which rapidly obtains the stored energy in the gain medium. This results in a short pulse incorporating that energy, and thus a high peak power.\n\n==== Mode-locking ====\n{{Main|Mode-locking}}\nA mode-locked laser is capable of emitting extremely short pulses on the order of tens of [[picosecond]]s down to less than 10 [[femtoseconds]]. These pulses will repeat at the round trip time, that is, the time that it takes light to complete one round trip between the mirrors comprising the resonator. Due to the [[Fourier uncertainty principle|Fourier limit]] (also known as energy-time [[Uncertainty principle|uncertainty]]), a pulse of such short temporal length has a spectrum spread over a considerable bandwidth. Thus such a gain medium must have a gain bandwidth sufficiently broad to amplify those frequencies. An example of a suitable material is [[titanium]]-doped, artificially grown [[sapphire]] ([[Ti-sapphire laser|Ti:sapphire]]) which has a very wide gain bandwidth and can thus produce pulses of only a few femtoseconds duration.\n\nSuch mode-locked lasers are a most versatile tool for researching processes occurring on extremely short time scales (known as femtosecond physics, [[femtosecond chemistry]] and [[ultrafast science]]), for maximizing the effect of [[nonlinear optics|nonlinearity]] in optical materials (e.g. in [[second-harmonic generation]], [[parametric down-conversion]], [[optical parametric oscillator]]s and the like) due to the large peak power, and in ablation applications.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Again, because of the extremely short pulse duration, such a laser will produce pulses which achieve an extremely high peak power.\n\n==== Pulsed pumping ====\nAnother method of achieving pulsed laser operation is to pump the laser material with a source that is itself pulsed, either through electronic charging in the case of flash lamps, or another laser which is already pulsed. Pulsed pumping was historically used with dye lasers where the inverted population lifetime of a dye molecule was so short that a high energy, fast pump was needed. The way to overcome this problem was to charge up large [[capacitors]] which are then switched to discharge through flashlamps, producing an intense flash. Pulsed pumping is also required for three-level lasers in which the lower energy level rapidly becomes highly populated preventing further lasing until those atoms relax to the ground state. These lasers, such as the excimer laser and the copper vapor laser, can never be operated in CW mode.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Foundations ===\nIn 1917, [[Albert Einstein]] established the theoretical foundations for the laser and the [[maser]] in the paper ''Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung'' (On the Quantum Theory of Radiation) via a re-derivation of [[Max Planck]]'s law of radiation, conceptually based upon probability coefficients ([[Einstein coefficients]]) for the absorption, spontaneous emission, and stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation.<ref name=Einstein1917>{{cite journal|last=Einstein|first=A|title=Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung|journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift|year=1917|volume=18|pages=121\u2013128|bibcode = 1917PhyZ...18..121E }}</ref> In 1928, [[Rudolf W.

As ideas developed, they abandoned [[infrared]] radiation to instead concentrate upon [[visible light]]. The concept originally was called an \"optical maser\". In 1958, Bell Labs filed a patent application for their proposed optical maser; and Schawlow and Townes submitted a manuscript of their theoretical calculations to the ''[[Physical Review]]'', published that year in Volume 112, Issue No. 6.\n\n[[File:Gould notebook 001.jpg|thumb|right|'''LASER notebook:''' First page of the notebook wherein [[Gordon Gould]] coined the LASER acronym, and described the elements for constructing the device.]]<!--FAIR USE of Gould notebook 001.jpg: see image description page at Image:Gould notebook 001.jpg for rationale -->\n\nSimultaneously, at [[Columbia University]], graduate student [[Gordon Gould]] was working on a [[doctoral thesis]] about the energy levels of excited [[thallium]]. When Gould and Townes met, they spoke of radiation [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]], as a general subject; afterwards, in November 1957, Gould noted his ideas for a \"laser\", including using an open [[resonator]] (later an essential laser-device component). Moreover, in 1958, Prokhorov independently proposed using an open resonator, the first published appearance (the USSR) of this idea. Elsewhere, in the U.S., Schawlow and Townes had agreed to an open-resonator laser design \u2013 apparently unaware of Prokhorov's publications and Gould's unpublished laser work.\n\nAt a conference in 1959, Gordon Gould published the term LASER in the paper ''The LASER, Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation''.<ref name=\"Gould1959\">{{cite book |last=Gould |first= R.

He continued developing the idea, and filed a [[patent application]] in April 1959. The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]] denied his application, and awarded a patent to [[Bell Labs]], in 1960. That provoked a twenty-eight-year [[lawsuit]], featuring scientific prestige and money as the stakes. Gould won his first minor patent in 1977, yet it was not until 1987 that he won the first significant patent lawsuit victory, when a Federal judge ordered the U.S. Patent Office to issue patents to Gould for the optically pumped and the [[gas discharge]] laser devices. The question of just how to assign credit for inventing the laser remains unresolved by historians.<ref>Joan Lisa Bromberg, ''The Laser in America, 1950\u20131970'' (1991), pp. 74\u201377 [http://www.aip.org/history/exhibits/laser/sections/whoinvented.html online]</ref>\n\nOn May 16, 1960, [[Theodore Maiman|Theodore H.

Maiman's functional laser used a solid-state [[flashlamp]]-pumped synthetic [[ruby]] [[crystal]] to produce red laser light, at 694 nanometers wavelength; however, the device only was capable of pulsed operation, because of its three-level pumping design scheme. Later that year, the [[Iran]]ian physicist [[Ali Javan]], and [[William R. Bennett, Jr.|William R. Bennett]], and [[Donald R. Herriott|Donald Herriott]], constructed the first [[gas laser]], using [[helium]] and [[neon]] that was capable of continuous operation in the infrared (U.S. Patent 3,149,290); later, Javan received the [[Albert Einstein Award]] in 1993. Basov and Javan proposed the semiconductor [[laser diode]] concept. In 1962, [[Robert N. Hall]] demonstrated the first ''laser diode'' device, made of [[gallium arsenide]] and emitted at 850&nbsp;nm the near-[[infrared]] band of the spectrum. Later that year, [[Nick Holonyak]], Jr. demonstrated the first semiconductor laser with a visible emission. This first semiconductor laser could only be used in pulsed-beam operation, and when cooled to [[liquid nitrogen]] temperatures (77&nbsp;K). In 1970, [[Zhores Ivanovich Alferov|Zhores Alferov]], in the USSR, and Izuo Hayashi and Morton Panish of [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] also independently developed room-temperature, continual-operation diode lasers, using the [[heterojunction]] structure.\n\n=== Recent innovations ===\n\n[[File:History of laser intensity.svg|thumb|250px|Graph showing the history of maximum laser pulse intensity throughout the past 40 years.]]\n\nSince the early period of laser history, laser research has produced a variety of improved and specialized laser types, optimized for different performance goals, including:\n* new wavelength bands\n* maximum average output power\n* maximum peak pulse [[energy]]\n* maximum peak pulse [[power (physics)|power]]\n* minimum output pulse duration\n* maximum power efficiency\n* minimum cost\nand this research continues to this day.\n\nLasing without maintaining the medium excited into a population inversion {{dubious|date=November 2010}} was discovered in 1992 in [[sodium]] gas and again in 1995 in [[rubidium]] gas by various international teams.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} This was accomplished by using an external maser to induce \"optical transparency\" in the medium by introducing and destructively interfering the ground electron transitions between two paths, so that the likelihood for the ground electrons to absorb any energy has been cancelled.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Types and operating principles ==\n:''For a more complete list of laser types see this [[list of laser types]].''\n\n[[File:Commercial laser lines.svg|thumb|400px|Wavelengths of commercially available lasers.

The [[helium\u2013neon laser]] (HeNe) is able to operate at a number of different wavelengths, however the vast majority are engineered to lase at 633&nbsp;nm; these relatively low cost but highly coherent lasers are extremely common in optical research and educational laboratories. Commercial [[Carbon dioxide laser|carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) lasers]] can emit many hundreds of watts in a single spatial mode which can be concentrated into a tiny spot. This emission is in the thermal infrared at 10.6&nbsp;\u00b5m; such lasers are regularly used in industry for cutting and welding. The efficiency of a CO<sub>2</sub> laser is unusually high: over 30%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phy.davidson.edu/stuhome/jimn/co2/pages/CO2Main.htm|last=Nolen|first=Jim|title=The Carbon Dioxide Laser|publisher=Davidson Physics|accessdate=17 August 2014|author2=Derek Verno }}</ref> [[Ion laser|Argon-ion]] lasers can operate at a number of lasing transitions between 351 and 528.7&nbsp;nm.

Such very high power lasers are especially of interest to the military, however continuous wave chemical lasers at very high power levels, fed by streams of gasses, have been developed and have some industrial applications. As examples, in the [[hydrogen fluoride laser]] (2700\u20132900&nbsp;nm) and the [[deuterium fluoride laser]] (3800&nbsp;nm) the reaction is the combination of hydrogen or deuterium gas with combustion products of [[ethylene]] in [[nitrogen trifluoride]].\n\n==== Excimer lasers ====\n[[Excimer laser]]s are a special sort of gas laser powered by an electric discharge in which the lasing medium is an [[excimer]], or more precisely an [[exciplex]] in existing designs. These are molecules which can only exist with one atom in an [[excited state|excited electronic state]]. Once the molecule transfers its excitation energy to a photon, therefore, its atoms are no longer bound to each other and the molecule disintegrates. This drastically reduces the population of the lower energy state thus greatly facilitating a population inversion. Excimers currently used are all [[:Category:Noble gas compounds|noble gas compounds]]; noble gasses are chemically inert and can only form compounds while in an excited state. Excimer lasers typically operate at [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths with major applications including semiconductor [[photolithography]] and [[LASIK]] eye surgery. Commonly used excimer molecules include ArF (emission at 193&nbsp;nm), KrCl (222&nbsp;nm), KrF (248&nbsp;nm), XeCl (308&nbsp;nm), and XeF (351&nbsp;nm).<ref>{{cite book\n | first=D. | last=Schuocker | year=1998\n | title=Handbook of the Eurolaser Academy\n | publisher=Springer | isbn=0-412-81910-4 }}</ref>\nThe molecular [[fluorine]] laser,  emitting at 157&nbsp;nm in the vacuum ultraviolet is sometimes referred to as an excimer laser, however this appears to be a misnomer inasmuch as F<sub>2</sub> is a stable compound.\n\n=== Solid-state lasers ===\n[[File:Starfield Optical Range - sodium laser.jpg|thumb|A 50 W [[FASOR (laser physics)|FASOR]], based on a Nd:YAG laser, used at the [[Starfire Optical Range]].]]\n[[Solid-state laser]]s use a crystalline or glass rod which is \"doped\" with ions that provide the required energy states. For example, the first working laser was a [[ruby laser]], made from [[ruby]] ([[chromium]]-doped [[corundum]]). The [[population inversion]] is actually maintained in the dopant. These materials are pumped optically using a shorter wavelength than the lasing wavelength, often from a flashtube or from another laser. The usage of the term \"solid-state\" in laser physics is narrower than in typical use. Semiconductor lasers (laser diodes) are typically ''not'' referred to as solid-state lasers.\n\n[[Neodymium]] is a common dopant in various solid-state laser crystals, including [[yttrium orthovanadate]] ([[Neodymium-doped yttrium orthovanadate|Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub>]]), [[yttrium lithium fluoride]] ([[Nd:YLF]]) and [[yttrium aluminium garnet]] ([[Nd:YAG]]). All these lasers can produce high powers in the [[infrared]] spectrum at 1064&nbsp;nm. They are used for cutting, welding and marking of metals and other materials, and also in [[spectroscopy]] and for pumping [[dye laser]]s. These lasers are also commonly [[Second-harmonic generation|frequency doubled]], [[Third harmonic generation|tripled]] or quadrupled to produce 532&nbsp;nm (green, visible), 355&nbsp;nm and 266&nbsp;nm ([[Ultraviolet|UV]]) beams, respectively. Frequency-doubled [[diode-pumped solid-state]] (DPSS) lasers are used to make bright green laser pointers.\n\n[[Ytterbium]], [[holmium]], [[thulium]], and [[erbium]] are other common \"dopants\" in solid-state lasers. Ytterbium is used in crystals such as Yb:YAG, Yb:KGW, Yb:KYW, Yb:SYS, Yb:BOYS, Yb:CaF<sub>2</sub>, typically operating around 1020\u20131050&nbsp;nm. They are potentially very efficient and high powered due to a small quantum defect. Extremely high powers in ultrashort pulses can be achieved with Yb:YAG. [[Holmium]]-doped YAG crystals emit at 2097&nbsp;nm and form an efficient laser operating at [[infrared]] wavelengths strongly absorbed by water-bearing tissues. The Ho-YAG is usually operated in a pulsed mode, and passed through optical fiber surgical devices to resurface joints, remove rot from teeth, vaporize cancers, and pulverize kidney and gall stones.\n\n[[Titanium]]-doped [[sapphire]] ([[Ti-sapphire laser|Ti:sapphire]]) produces a highly [[tunable laser|tunable]] [[infrared]] laser, commonly used for [[spectroscopy]]. It is also notable for use as a mode-locked laser producing [[ultrashort pulse]]s of extremely high peak power.\n\nThermal limitations in solid-state lasers arise from unconverted pump power that heats the medium. This heat, when coupled with a high thermo-optic coefficient (d''n''/d''T'') can cause thermal lensing and reduce the quantum efficiency. Diode-pumped thin [[disk laser]]s overcome these issues by having a gain medium that is much thinner than the diameter of the pump beam. This allows for a more uniform temperature in the material. Thin disk lasers have been shown to produce beams of up to one kilowatt.<ref>C. Stewen, M. Larionov, and A. Giesen, \"Yb:YAG thin disk laser with 1 kW output power\", in OSA Trends in Optics and Photonics, Advanced Solid-State Lasers, H. Injeyan, U. Keller, and C. Marshall, ed. (Optical Society of America, Washington, D.C.., 2000) pp. 35\u201341.</ref>\n\n=== Fiber lasers ===\n{{Main|Fiber laser}}\n\nSolid-state lasers or laser amplifiers where the light is guided due to the [[total internal reflection]] in a single mode [[optical fiber]] are instead called [[fiber laser]]s. Guiding of light allows extremely long gain regions providing good cooling conditions; fibers have high surface area to volume ratio which allows efficient cooling. In addition, the fiber's waveguiding properties tend to reduce thermal distortion of the beam. [[Erbium]] and [[ytterbium]] ions are common active species in such lasers.\n\nQuite often, the fiber laser is designed as a [[double-clad fiber]]. This type of fiber consists of a fiber core, an inner cladding and an outer cladding. The index of the three concentric layers is chosen so that the fiber core acts as a single-mode fiber for the laser emission while the outer cladding acts as a highly multimode core for the pump laser. This lets the pump propagate a large amount of power into and through the active inner core region, while still having a high numerical aperture (NA) to have easy launching conditions.\n\nPump light can be used more efficiently by creating a [[fiber disk laser]], or a stack of such lasers.\n\nFiber lasers have a fundamental limit in that the intensity of the light in the fiber cannot be so high that optical nonlinearities induced by the local electric field strength can become dominant and prevent laser operation and/or lead to the material destruction of the fiber. This effect is called [[photodarkening]]. In bulk laser materials, the cooling is not so efficient, and it is difficult to separate the effects of photodarkening from the thermal effects, but the experiments in fibers show that the photodarkening can be attributed to the formation of long-living [[color center]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n=== Photonic crystal lasers ===\nPhotonic crystal lasers are lasers based on nano-structures that provide the mode confinement and the [[Density of states|density of optical states]] (DOS) structure required for the feedback to take place.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} They are typical micrometer-sized{{dubious|date=November 2010}} and tunable on the bands of the photonic crystals.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Ultraviolet photonic crystal laser |first=X. |last=Wu |volume=85 |issue=17 |date=October 25, 2004|journal=Applied Physics Letters |doi=10.1063/1.1808888|arxiv = physics/0406005 |bibcode = 2004ApPhL..85.3657W |page=3657 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}\n\n=== Semiconductor lasers ===\n[[File:Diode laser.jpg|thumb|A 5.6 mm 'closed can' commercial laser diode, probably from a [[CD player|CD]] or [[DVD player]]]]\nSemiconductor lasers are [[diode]]s which are electrically pumped.

External-cavity semiconductor lasers have a semiconductor active medium in a larger cavity. These devices can generate high power outputs with good beam quality, wavelength-tunable narrow-[[linewidth]] radiation, or ultrashort laser pulses.\n\nIn 2012, [[Nichia]] and [[OSRAM]] developed and manufactured commercial high-power green laser diodes (515/520&nbsp;nm), which compete with traditional diode-pumped solid-state lasers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nichia.co.jp/en/product/laser.html|title=LASER Diode|work=nichia.co.jp}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osram-os.com/osram_os/en/products/product-catalog/laser-diodes/visible-laser/green-laser/index.jsp|title=Green Laser|date=August 19, 2015|work=osram-os.com}}</ref>\n\nVertical cavity surface-emitting lasers ([[VCSEL]]s) are semiconductor lasers whose emission direction is perpendicular to the surface of the wafer.

[[VECSEL]]s are external-cavity VCSELs. [[Quantum cascade laser]]s are semiconductor lasers that have an active transition between energy ''sub-bands'' of an electron in a structure containing several [[quantum well]]s.\n\nThe development of a [[silicon]] laser is important in the field of [[optical computing]]. Silicon is the material of choice for [[integrated circuits]], and so electronic and [[silicon photonic]] components (such as [[optical interconnect]]s) could be fabricated on the same chip. Unfortunately, silicon is a difficult lasing material to deal with, since it has certain properties which block lasing. However, recently teams have produced silicon lasers through methods such as fabricating the lasing material from silicon and other semiconductor materials, such as [[indium(III) phosphide]] or [[gallium(III) arsenide]], materials which allow coherent light to be produced from silicon. These are called [[hybrid silicon laser]]. Another type is a [[Raman laser]], which takes advantage of [[Raman scattering]] to produce a laser from materials such as silicon.\n\n=== Dye lasers ===\n[[File:Coherent 899 dye laser.jpg|thumb|Close-up of a table-top dye laser based on [[Rhodamine 6G]] ]]\n[[Dye laser]]s use an organic dye as the gain medium. The wide gain spectrum of available dyes, or mixtures of dyes, allows these lasers to be highly tunable, or to produce very short-duration pulses ([[on the order of]] a few [[femtosecond]]s). Although these [[tunable laser]]s are mainly known in their liquid form, researchers have also demonstrated narrow-linewidth tunable emission in dispersive oscillator configurations incorporating solid-state dye gain media.<ref>[[F. J. Duarte]], [http://www.tunablelaseroptics.com/ ''Tunable Laser Optics'', 2nd Edition (CRC, New York, 2015)].</ref> In their most prevalent form these [[solid state dye lasers]] use dye-doped polymers as laser media.\n\n=== Free-electron lasers ===\n[[File:FELIX.jpg|thumb|The free-electron laser ''FELIX'' at the FOM Institute for Plasma Physics Rijnhuizen, [[Nieuwegein]]]]\n[[Free-electron laser]]s, or FELs, generate coherent, high power radiation that is widely tunable, currently ranging in wavelength from microwaves through [[terahertz radiation]] and infrared to the visible spectrum, to soft X-rays. They have the widest frequency range of any laser type. While FEL beams share the same optical traits as other lasers, such as coherent radiation, FEL operation is quite different. Unlike gas, liquid, or solid-state lasers, which rely on bound atomic or molecular states, FELs use a relativistic electron beam as the lasing medium, hence the term ''free-electron''.\n\n=== Exotic media ===\nThe pursuit of a high-quantum-energy laser using transitions between [[Nuclear isomer|isomeric states]] of an [[atomic nucleus]] has been the subject of wide-ranging academic research since the early 1970s.

Lasers used by hobbyists are generally of class IIIa or IIIb (see [[#Safety|Safety]]), although some have made their own class IV types.<ref>[http://www.powerlabs.org/laser.htm PowerLabs CO<sub>2</sub> LASER!] Sam Barros June 21, 2006. Retrieved January 1, 2007.</ref> However, compared to other hobbyists, laser hobbyists are far less common, due to the cost and potential dangers involved. Due to the cost of lasers, some hobbyists use inexpensive means to obtain lasers, such as salvaging laser diodes from broken DVD players (red), [[Blu-ray]] players (violet), or even higher power laser diodes from CD or [[DVD burner]]s.<ref>{{cite web |first=Stephanie |last=Maks |url=http://planetstephanie.net/dvd-laser/ |title=Howto: Make a DVD burner into a high-powered laser |work=Transmissions from Planet Stephanie |accessdate=April 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHobbyists also have been taking surplus pulsed lasers from retired military applications and modifying them for pulsed [[holography]]. Pulsed Ruby and pulsed YAG lasers have been used.\n\n=== As weapons ===\n[[File:THEL-ACTD.jpg|thumb|250px|The US-Israeli [[Tactical High Energy Laser|Tactical High Energy weapon]] has been used to shoot down rockets and artillery shells.]]\n\nLasers of all but the lowest powers can potentially be used as incapacitating weapons, through their ability to produce temporary or permanent vision loss in varying degrees when aimed at the eyes. The degree, character, and duration of vision impairment caused by eye exposure to laser light varies with the power of the laser, the wavelength(s), the collimation of the beam, the exact orientation of the beam, and the duration of exposure. Lasers of even a fraction of a watt in power can produce immediate, permanent vision loss under certain conditions, making such lasers potential non-lethal but incapacitating weapons. The extreme handicap that laser-induced blindness represents makes the use of lasers even as [[non-lethal weapon]]s morally controversial, and weapons designed to cause blindness have been banned by the [[Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons]]. Incidents of pilots being exposed to lasers while flying have prompted aviation authorities to implement special procedures to deal with such hazards.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7990013.stm |work=BBC News | title=Police fight back on laser threat | date=April 8, 2009 | accessdate=April 4, 2010}}</ref>\n\nLaser weapons capable of directly damaging or destroying a target in combat are still in the experimental stage. The general idea of laser-beam weaponry is to hit a target with a train of brief pulses of light. The rapid evaporation and expansion of the surface causes shockwaves that damage the target.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The power needed to project a high-powered laser beam of this kind is beyond the limit of current mobile power technology, thus favoring chemically powered [[gas dynamic laser]]s. Example experimental systems include [[MIRACL]] and the [[Tactical High Energy Laser]].\n\n[[File:YAL-1A Airborne Laser unstowed crop.jpg|thumb|250px|Boeing YAL-1.

In March 2009, [[Northrop Grumman]] claimed that its engineers in [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] had successfully built and tested an electrically powered solid state laser capable of producing a 100-kilowatt beam, powerful enough to destroy an airplane. According to Brian Strickland, manager for the [[United States Army]]'s Joint High Power Solid State Laser program, an electrically powered laser is capable of being mounted in an aircraft, ship, or other vehicle because it requires much less space for its supporting equipment than a chemical laser.<ref>{{cite web |first=Pae |last= Peter |title=Northrop Advance Brings Era Of The Laser Gun Closer |work=Los Angeles Times |date=March 19, 2009 |page= B2 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/19/business/fi-laser19 }}</ref> However, the source of such a large electrical power in a mobile application remained unclear.

Right: US laser warning label, in this case for a Class 3B laser }}\n{{Main|Laser safety}}\nEven the first laser was recognized as being potentially dangerous. [[Theodore Maiman]] characterized the first laser as having a power of one \"Gillette\" as it could burn through one [[Global Gillette|Gillette]] [[razor]] blade. Today, it is accepted that even low-power lasers with only a few milliwatts of output power can be hazardous to human eyesight when the beam hits the eye directly or after reflection from a shiny surface. At wavelengths which the [[cornea]] and the lens can focus well, the coherence and low divergence of laser light means that it can be focused by the [[human eye|eye]] into an extremely small spot on the [[retina]], resulting in localized burning and permanent damage in seconds or even less time.\n\nLasers are usually labeled with a safety class number, which identifies how dangerous the laser is:\n*Class 1 is inherently safe, usually because the light is contained in an enclosure, for example in CD players.\n*Class 2 is safe during normal use; the [[blink reflex]] of the eye will prevent damage. Usually up to 1&nbsp;mW power, for example laser pointers.\n*Class 3R (formerly IIIa) lasers are usually up to 5&nbsp;mW and involve a small risk of eye damage within the time of the blink reflex. Staring into such a beam for several seconds is likely to cause damage to a spot on the retina.\n*Class 3B can cause immediate eye damage upon exposure.\n*Class 4 lasers can burn skin, and in some cases, even scattered light can cause eye and/or skin damage. Many industrial and scientific lasers are in this class.\nThe indicated powers are for visible-light, continuous-wave lasers. For pulsed lasers and invisible wavelengths, other power limits apply. People working with class 3B and class 4 lasers can protect their eyes with safety goggles which are designed to absorb light of a particular wavelength.\n\nInfrared lasers with wavelengths longer than about 1.4 micrometers are often referred to as \"eye-safe\", because the cornea tends to absorb light at these wavelengths, protecting the retina from damage. The label \"eye-safe\" can be misleading, however, as it applies only to relatively low power continuous wave beams; a high power or [[Q-switched]] laser at these wavelengths can burn the cornea, causing severe eye damage, and even moderate power lasers can injure the eye.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col||12em}}\n* [[Bessel beam]]\n* [[Coherent perfect absorber]]\n* [[Dazzler (weapon)]]\n* [[Homogeneous broadening]]\n* [[Induced gamma emission]]\n* [[Injection seeder]]\n* [[International Laser Display Association]]\n* [[Laser accelerometer]]\n* [[Lasers and aviation safety]]\n* [[Laser beam profiler]]\n* [[Laser bonding]]\n* [[Laser converting]]\n* [[Laser cooling]]\n* [[Laser engraving]]\n* [[Laser medicine]]\n* [[Laser scalpel]]\n* [[3D scanner]]\n* [[Laser turntable]]\n* [[Laser beam welding]]\n* [[List of laser articles]]\n* [[List of light sources]]\n* [[Mercury laser]]\n* [[Nanolaser]]\n* [[Nonlinear optics]]\n* [[Reference beam]]\n* [[Rytov number]]\n* [[Sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation]]\n* [[Selective laser sintering]]\n* [[Spaser]]\n* [[Speckle pattern]]\n* [[Tophat beam]]\n* [[Vortex laser]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n; Books\n* Bertolotti, Mario (1999, trans. 2004).
