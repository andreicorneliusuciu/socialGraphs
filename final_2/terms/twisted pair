It was invented by [[Alexander Graham Bell]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=McBee|first1=David Barnett, David Groth, Jim|title=Cabling : the complete guide to network wiring|date=2004|publisher=SYBEX|location=San Francisco|isbn=9780782143317|page=11|edition=3rd ed.|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=AKDSTYu3nl4C&pg=PA11&dq=Twisted+pair+cable+invention&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwipqO3pjMbOAhXBQo8KHeaoCXEQ6AEISzAG#v=onepage&q=Twisted%20pair%20cable%20invention&f=false|accessdate=16 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Explanation==\nIn [[balanced pair]] operation, the two wires carry equal and opposite signals, and the destination detects the difference between the two. This is known as [[differential signaling|differential mode]] transmission. Noise sources introduce signals into the wires by coupling of electric or magnetic fields and tend to couple to both wires equally. The noise thus produces a common-mode signal which is canceled at the receiver when the difference signal is taken.\n\nThis method starts to fail when the noise source is close to the signal wires; the closer wire will couple with the noise more strongly and the [[common-mode rejection ratio|common-mode rejection]] of the receiver will fail to eliminate it. This problem is especially apparent in telecommunication cables where pairs in the same cable lie next to each other for many miles. One pair can induce [[crosstalk]] in another and it is additive along the length of the cable. Twisting the pairs counters this effect as on each half twist the wire nearest to the noise-source is exchanged.\n\nProviding the interfering source remains uniform, or nearly so, over the distance of a single twist, the induced noise will remain common-mode. Differential signaling also reduces [[electromagnetic radiation]] from the cable, along with the associated [[attenuation]] allowing for greater distance between exchanges.\n\nThe twist rate (also called ''pitch'' of the twist, usually defined in twists per [[meter]]) makes up part of the specification for a given type of cable. When nearby pairs have equal twist rates, the same conductors of the different pairs may repeatedly lie next to each other, partially undoing the benefits of differential mode. For this reason it is commonly specified that, at least for cables containing small numbers of pairs, the twist rates must differ.<ref name=\"dmray\">{{cite web|title=Crosstalk dependence on number of turns/inch for twisted pair versions of the end-cap umbilical cable|url=http://www.hep.ph.ic.ac.uk/~dmray/pdffiles/TP_umbilical_studies.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to shielded or foiled twisted pair (typically F/UTP or S/FTP [[#Cable shielding|cable shielding]]), UTP (unshielded twisted pair) cable is not surrounded by any shielding. UTP is the primary wire type for [[telephone]] usage and is very common for [[computer networking]], especially as [[patch cable]]s or temporary network connections due to the high flexibility of the cables.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Wire Transposition.svg|thumb|Wire transposition on top of pole]]\n\nThe earliest telephones used telegraph lines, or open-wire [[single-wire earth return]] circuits. In the 1880s electric [[tram]]s were installed in many cities, which induced noise into these circuits. [[Lawsuit]]s being unavailing, the telephone companies converted to [[balanced circuit]]s, which had the incidental benefit of reducing [[attenuation]], hence increasing range.\n\nAs electrical power distribution became more commonplace, this measure proved inadequate. Two wires, strung on either side of cross bars on [[utility pole]]s, shared the route with electrical [[power line]]s. Within a few years, the growing use of electricity again brought an increase of interference, so engineers devised a method called [[Transposition (telecommunications)|wire transposition]], to cancel out the interference.\n\nIn wire transposition, the wires exchange position once every several poles. In this way, the two wires would receive similar [[Electromagnetic interference|EMI]] from power lines. This represented an early implementation of twisting, with a twist rate of about four twists per [[kilometre]], or six per [[mile]]. Such open-wire balanced lines with periodic transpositions still survive today in some rural areas.\n\nTwisted-pair cabling was invented by [[Alexander Graham Bell]] in 1881.<ref>\n{{Citation\n | inventor1-last = Bell\n | inventor1-first = Alexander Graham\n | title = Telephone-circuit\n | issue-date = 1881\n | patent-number = 244426\n | country-code = US\n}}. See also TIFF format scans for [http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00244426&idkey=NONE USPTO 00244426]\n</ref> By 1900, the entire American [[telephone line]] network was either twisted pair or open wire with transposition to guard against interference. Today, most of the millions of kilometres of twisted pairs in the world are [[outside plant|outdoor landlines]], owned by telephone companies, used for voice service, and only handled or even seen by telephone workers.\n\n==Unshielded twisted pair (UTP)==\n[[File:UTP-cable.svg|thumb|Cross-section of cable with several unshielded twisted pairs]]\n\nUTP cables are found in many [[Ethernet]] networks and telephone systems. For indoor telephone applications, UTP is often grouped into sets of 25 pairs according to a standard [[25-pair color code]] originally developed by [[AT&T Corporation]]. A typical subset of these colors (white/blue, blue/white, white/orange, orange/white) shows up in most UTP cables. The cables are typically made with [[copper]] wires measured at 22 or 24 [[American Wire Gauge]] (AWG),<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iWMDf4ciB1AC&pg=SA6-PA2#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Networks: Design and Management'']</ref> with the colored insulation typically made from an insulator such as [[polyethylene]] or [[Fluorinated ethylene propylene|FEP]] and the total package covered in a [[polyethylene]] jacket.\n\nFor urban outdoor telephone cables containing hundreds or thousands of pairs, the cable is divided into smaller but identical bundles. Each bundle consists of twisted pairs that have different twist rates. The bundles are in turn twisted together to make up the cable. Pairs having the same twist rate within the cable can still experience some degree of [[crosstalk]]. Wire pairs are selected carefully to minimize crosstalk within a large cable.\n\n[[File:UTP cable.jpg|thumb|Unshielded twisted pair cable with different twist rates]]\nUTP [[cable]] is also the most common cable used in [[computer networking]]. Modern [[Ethernet]], the most common data networking standard, can use UTP cables. Twisted pair cabling is often used in data networks for short and medium length connections because of its relatively lower costs compared to [[optical fiber]] and [[coaxial cable]].\n\nUTP is also finding increasing use in [[video]] applications, primarily in [[security camera]]s. Many cameras include a UTP output with [[screw terminal]]s; UTP cable [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] has improved to match the [[baseband]] of [[television]] signals. As UTP is a balanced transmission line, a [[balun]] is needed to connect to unbalanced equipment, for example any using [[BNC connector]]s and designed for coaxial cable.\n\n==Cable shielding==\n{{Main article|Electromagnetic shielding}}\n[[File:FTP cable3.jpg|thumb|F/UTP cable]]\n[[File:TwistedPair S-FTP.jpg|thumb|S/FTP cable]]\n[[File:10G BASE-T x 3 cables.svg|thumb|U/FTP, F/UTP and F/FTP are used in Cat 6a cables]]\n\nTwisted-pair cables are often shielded in an attempt to prevent electromagnetic interference. Shielding provides an electrically conductive barrier to attenuate electromagnetic waves external to the shield, and provides a conduction path by which induced currents can be circulated and returned to the source, via ground reference connection.\n\nThis shielding can be applied to individual pairs or quads, or to the collection of pairs. Individual pairs are foiled, while overall cable may use braided screen, foil, or braiding with foil.\n\nWhen shielding is applied to the collection of pairs, this is usually referred to as screening, but different vendors and authors use \"screening\", \"shielding\", and \"STP\" inconsistently to denote various shielded cable types.<ref name=\"anitech\">[http://www.anitech-systems.com/MP4000/manual/briefs/ICM-4020E_Hub_Switch_Route_Cable_BR120501.pdf Anitech Systems MP 4000 Manual]</ref><ref name=\"siemon1\">[http://www.siemon.com/us/white_papers/06-07-20-grounding.asp Grounding for Screened and Shielded Network Cabling - Siemon]</ref>\n\n[[ISO/IEC 11801]]:2002 (Annex E) attempts to internationally standardize the various designations for shielded cables by using combinations of three letters - U for unshielded, S for braided shielding (in outer layer only), and F for foiled shielding - to explicitly indicate the type of screen for overall cable protection and for individual pairs or quads, using a two-part abbreviation in the form of ''x/xTP''.\n\nShielded Cat 5e, Cat 6/6<sub>A</sub>, and Cat 8/8.1 cables typically have F/UTP construction, while shielded Cat 7/7<sub>A</sub> and Cat 8.2 cables use S/FTP construction.<ref name=maguire>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieee802.org/3/bq/public/jul15/maguire_25gbt_01_0715.pdf|accessdate=2015-09-25|date=2015-07-12 |title=Size of the Category 7A Installed Base|last=Valerie |first=Maguire}}</ref>\n\nBecause the shielding is made of metal, it may also serve as a ground. Usually a shielded twisted pair cable has a special grounding wire added called a drain wire which is electrically connected to the shield or screen. The drain wire simplifies connection to ground at the connectors.\n\nCommon shield construction types used include:\n; Individual shield (U/FTP): Individual shielding with aluminum foil for each twisted pair or quad. Common names: pair in metal foil, shielded twisted pair, screened twisted pair. This type of shielding protects cable from external EMI entering or exiting the cable and also protects neighboring pairs from crosstalk.\n\n; Overall shield (F/UTP, S/UTP, and SF/UTP): Overall foil, braided shield or braiding with foil across all of the pairs within the 100&nbsp;ohm twisted pair cable. Common names: foiled twisted pair, shielded twisted pair, screened twisted pair. This type of shielding helps prevent EMI from entering or exiting the cable.\n\n; Individual and overall shield (F/FTP, S/FTP, and SF/FTP): Individual shielding using foil between the twisted pair sets, and also an outer foil and/or braided shielding. Common names: fully shielded twisted pair, screened foiled twisted pair, shielded foiled twisted pair, screened shielded twisted pair, shielded screened twisted pair. This type of shielding helps prevent EMI from entering or exiting the cable and also protects neighboring pairs from crosstalk.\n\nAn early example of shielded twisted-pair is IBM STP-A, which was a two-pair 150&nbsp;ohm S/FTP cable defined in 1985 by the IBM Cabling System specifications, and used with [[token ring]] or [[Fiber Distributed Data Interface|FDDI networks]].<ref name=\"anitech\" /><ref>http://www.techfest.com/networking/cabling/ibmcs.htm</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Common industry abbreviations for cable construction\n|-\n!

It is less flexible than stranded cable and is more prone to failure if repeatedly flexed. Stranded cable is used for fly leads at patch panel and for connections from wall-ports to end devices, as it resists cracking of the conductors.\n\nConnectors need to be designed differently for solid core than for stranded. Use of a connector with the wrong cable type is likely to lead to unreliable cabling. Plugs designed for solid and stranded core are readily available, and some vendors even offer plugs designed for use with both types. The punch-down blocks on patch-panel and wall-port jacks are designed for use with solid core cable.\n\n==Advantages==\n* Electrical noise going into or coming from the cable can be prevented.<ref name=\"cirris\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cirris.com/testing/twisted_pair/twist.html|title=Twisted Pair Testing}}</ref>\n* [[Crosstalk]] is minimized.<ref name=\"cirris\" />\n* Cheapest form of cable available for networking purposes.<ref name=\"cirris\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cirris.com/testing/twisted_pair/twist.html|title=Twisted Pair Testing}}</ref>\n* Easy to handle and install.<ref name=\"cirris\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cirris.com/testing/twisted_pair/twist.html|title=Twisted Pair Testing}}</ref>\n\n==Disadvantages==\n* Deformation: twisted pair's susceptibility to electromagnetic interference greatly depends on the pair twisting schemes (sometimes patented by the manufacturers) staying intact during the installation. As a result, twisted pair cables usually have stringent requirements for maximum pulling tension as well as minimum bend radius. This fragility of twisted pair cables makes the installation practices an important part of ensuring the cable's performance.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Impact of Installation Stresses On Cable Performance|url=http://www.belden.com/docs/upload/TB66.pdf|publisher=Belden|accessdate=13 August 2016|format=PDF}}</ref>\n* Delay skew: different pairs within the cable have different delays, due to different twist rates used to minimize crosstalk between the pairs.  This can degrade image quality when multiple pairs are used to carry components of a video signal. Low skew cable is available to mitigate this problem.<ref>{{cite web|title= 7987R Technical Data Sheet (Metric)|url=http://www.belden.com/techdatas/metric/7987R.pdf|website=Belden.com|publisher=Belden|accessdate=13 August 2016|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= 7989R Technical Data Sheet (Metric)|url=http://www.belden.com/techdatas/metric/7989R.pdf|website=Belden.com|publisher=Belden|accessdate=13 August 2016|format=PDF}}</ref>\n* Imbalance: differences between the two wires in a pair can cause coupling between the common mode and the differential mode.  Differential to common mode conversion produces common mode currents that can cause external interference and can produce common mode signals in other pairs.  Common mode to differential mode conversion can produce differential mode signals from common mode interference from other pairs or external sources.  Imbalance can be caused by asymmetry between the two conductors of the pair from each other and in relationship to other wires and the shield.  Some sources of asymmetry are differences in conductor diameter and insulation thickness.  In telephone jargon, the common mode is called ''longitudinal'' and the differential mode is called ''metallic''.<ref name=\"Reeve\">{{cite book| last=Reeve | first=Whitman D. | year= 1995|title=Subscriber Loop Signaling and Transmission Handbook - Digital |edition=1st |publisher= IEEE Press | isbn= 0-7803-0440-3 | pp=215-220}}</ref>\n\n==Less common variants==\n; Loaded twisted pair\n: A twisted pair that has intentionally added [[inductance]], formerly common practice on telecommunication lines.
