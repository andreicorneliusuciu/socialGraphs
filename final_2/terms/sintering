The atoms in the materials diffuse across the boundaries of the particles, fusing the particles together and creating one solid piece. Because the sintering temperature does not have to reach the melting point of the material, sintering is often chosen as the shaping process for materials with extremely high melting points such as [[tungsten]] and [[molybdenum]]. The study of sintering in metallurgy powder-related processes is known as [[powder metallurgy]]. An example of sintering can be observed when ice cubes in a glass of water adhere to each other, which is driven by the temperature difference between the water and the ice. Examples of pressure-driven sintering are the compacting of snowfall to a glacier, or the forming of a hard snowball by pressing loose snow together.\n\nThe word \"sinter\" comes from the [[Middle High German]] ''sinter'', a [[cognate]] of English \"[[cinder]]\".\n\n== General sintering ==\n\nSintering is effective when the process reduces the [[porosity]] and enhances properties such as strength, [[electrical conductivity]], [[translucency]] and [[thermal conductivity]]; yet, in other cases, it may be useful to increase its strength but keep its gas absorbency constant as in filters or catalysts. During the firing process, atomic diffusion drives powder surface elimination in different stages, starting from the formation of necks between powders to final elimination of small pores at the end of the process.\n \nThe driving force for densification is the change in free energy from the decrease in surface area and lowering of the surface free energy by the replacement of solid-vapor interfaces. It forms new but lower-energy solid-solid interfaces with a total decrease in free energy occurring on sintering 1-micrometre particles a 1 cal/g decrease. On a microscopic scale, material transfer is affected by the change in pressure and differences in free energy across the curved surface. If the size of the particle is small (and its curvature is high), these effects become very large in magnitude. The change in energy is much higher when the radius of curvature is less than a few micrometres, which is one of the main reasons why much ceramic technology is based on the use of fine-particle materials.<ref name=Kingery/>\n\nFor properties such as strength and conductivity, the bond area in relation to the particle size is the determining factor.  The variables that can be controlled for any given material are the temperature and the initial grain size, because the vapor pressure depends upon temperature. Through time, the particle radius and the vapor pressure are proportional to (p<sub>0</sub>)<sup>2/3</sup> and to (p<sub>0</sub>)<sup>1/3</sup>, respectively.<ref name=Kingery/>\n\nThe source of power for solid-state processes is the change in free or chemical potential energy between the neck and the surface of the particle. This energy creates a transfer of material through the fastest means possible; if transfer were to take place from the particle volume or the grain boundary between particles, then there would be particle reduction and pore destruction. The pore elimination occurs faster for a trial with many pores of uniform size and higher porosity where the boundary diffusion distance is smaller. For the latter portions of the process, boundary and lattice diffusion from the boundary become important.<ref name=Kingery/>\n\nControl of temperature is very important to the sintering process, since grain-boundary diffusion and volume diffusion rely heavily upon temperature, the size and distribution of particles of the material, the materials composition, and often the sintering environment to be controlled.<ref name=Kingery>{{Cite journal|last1 =Kingery|first1 =W.

These objects are made from substances such as [[glass]], [[alumina]], [[zirconia]], [[silica]], [[magnesia (mineral)|magnesia]], [[Lime (mineral)|lime]], [[beryllium oxide]], and [[ferric oxide]]. Some ceramic raw materials have a lower [[Chemical affinity|affinity]] for water and a lower [[plasticity index]] than [[clay]], requiring organic additives in the stages before sintering. The general procedure of creating ceramic objects via sintering of powders includes:\n\n*Mixing water, [[Binder (material)|binder]], [[deflocculant]], and unfired ceramic powder to form a [[slurry]];\n*[[Spray drying|Spray-drying]] the slurry;\n*Putting the spray dried powder into a mold and pressing it to form a green body (an unsintered ceramic item);\n*Heating the green body at low temperature to burn off the binder;\n*Sintering at a high temperature to fuse the ceramic particles together.\n\nAll the characteristic temperatures associated with phase transformation, glass transitions, and melting points, occurring during a sinterisation cycle of a particular ceramics formulation (i.e., tails and frits) can be easily obtained by observing the expansion-temperature curves during [[optical dilatometer]] thermal analysis. In fact, sinterisation is associated with a remarkable shrinkage of the material because glass phases flow once their transition temperature is reached, and start consolidating the powdery structure and considerably reducing the porosity of the material.\n\nSintering is performed at high temperature. Besides, second and/or third external force (such as pressure, electrical current) could be used. Commonly used second external force is pressure. So, the sintering that performed just using temperature is generally called \"pressureless sintering\". Pressureless sintering is possible with graded metal-ceramic composites, with a nanoparticle sintering aid and bulk molding technology. A variant used for 3D shapes is called [[hot isostatic pressing]].\n\nTo allow efficient stacking of product in the furnace during sintering and prevent parts sticking together, many manufacturers separate ware using ceramic powder separator sheets. These sheets are available in various materials such as alumina, zirconia and magnesia. They are additionally categorized by fine, medium and coarse particle sizes. By matching the material and particle size to the ware being sintered, surface damage and contamination can be reduced while maximizing furnace loading.\n\n== Sintering of metallic powders ==\n\n[[File:Iron powder.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Iron powder]]]]\n\nMost, if not all, metals can be sintered. This applies especially to pure metals produced in vacuum which suffer no surface contamination. Sintering under atmospheric pressure requires the use of a protective gas, quite often [[endothermic gas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crystec.com/kllendoe.htm|title=endo gas}}</ref> Sintering, with subsequent reworking, can produce a great range of material properties. Changes in density, [[alloy]]ing, or heat treatments can alter the physical characteristics of various products. For instance, the [[Young's Modulus]] ''E<sub>n</sub>'' of sintered [[iron]] powders remains insensitive to sintering time, alloying, or particle size in the original powder, but depends upon the density of the final product:\n\n<math>E_n/E = (D/d)^{3.4}</math>\n\nwhere ''D'' is the density, ''E'' is [[Young's modulus]] and ''d'' is the maximum density of iron.\n\nSintering is static when a metal powder under certain external conditions may exhibit coalescence, and yet reverts to its normal behavior when such conditions are removed. In most cases, the density of a collection of grains increases as material flows into voids, causing a decrease in overall volume. Mass movements that occur during sintering consist of the reduction of total porosity by repacking, followed by material transport due to [[evaporation]] and [[condensation]] from [[diffusion]]. In the final stages, metal atoms move along crystal boundaries to the walls of internal pores, redistributing mass from the internal bulk of the object and smoothing pore walls. [[Surface tension]] is the driving force for this movement.\n\nA special form of sintering (which is still considered part of powder metallurgy) is liquid-state sintering in which at least one but not all elements are in a liquid state. Liquid-state sintering is required for making [[cemented carbide]] or [[tungsten carbide]].\n\nSintered [[bronze]] in particular is frequently used as a material for [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], since its porosity allows lubricants to flow through it or remain captured within it. Sintered copper may be used as a wicking structure in certain types of [[heat pipe]] construction, where the porosity allows a liquid agent to move through the porous material via [[capillary action]]. For materials that have high melting points such as [[molybdenum]], [[tungsten]], [[rhenium]], [[tantalum]], [[osmium]] and [[carbon]], sintering is one of the few viable manufacturing processes. In these cases, very low porosity is desirable and can often be achieved.\n\nSintered metal powder is used to make [[frangibility|frangible]] shotgun shells called [[breaching round]]s, as used by military and SWAT teams to quickly force entry into a locked room. These shotgun shells are designed to destroy door deadbolts, locks and hinges without risking lives by ricocheting or by flying on at lethal speed through the door. They work by destroying the object they hit and then dispersing into a relatively harmless powder.\n\nSintered bronze and stainless steel are used as filter materials in applications requiring high temperature resistance while retaining the ability to regenerate the filter element. For example, sintered stainless steel elements are employed for filtering steam in food and pharmaceutical applications, and sintered bronze in aircraft hydraulic systems.\n\nSintering of powders containing precious metals such as [[silver]] and [[gold]] is used to make small jewelry items.\n\n===Advantages===\nParticular advantages of the powder technology include:\n\n# Very high levels of [[wiktionary:Purity|purity]] and uniformity in starting materials\n# Preservation of purity, due to the simpler subsequent [[Manufacturing|fabrication]] process (fewer steps) that it makes possible\n# Stabilization of the details of repetitive operations, by control of [[Crystallite|grain]] size during the input stages\n# Absence of binding contact between segregated powder particles \u2013 or \"inclusions\" (called stringering) \u2013 as often occurs in melting processes\n# No [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] needed to produce directional elongation of grains\n# Capability to produce materials of controlled, uniform porosity.\n# Capability to produce nearly net-shaped objects.\n# Capability to produce materials which cannot be produced by any other technology.\n# Capability to fabricate high-strength material like turbine blades.\n# After sintering the mechanical strength to handling becomes higher.\n\nThe literature contains many references on sintering dissimilar materials to produce solid/solid-phase compounds or solid/melt mixtures at the processing stage. Almost any substance can be obtained in powder form, through either chemical, mechanical or physical processes, so basically any material can be obtained through sintering. When pure elements are sintered, the leftover powder is still pure, so it can be recycled.\n\n=== Disadvantages ===\n\nParticular disadvantages of the powder technology include:\n\n# 100% sintered (iron ore) can not be charged in the blast furnace.\n# By sintering one cannot create uniform sizes.\n# Micro- and nano-structures produced before sintering are often destroyed.\n\n== Plastics sintering ==\n\nPlastic materials are formed by sintering for applications that require materials of specific porosity. Sintered plastic porous components are used in filtration and to control fluid and gas flows. Sintered plastics are used in applications requiring wicking properties, such as marking pen nibs. Sintered [[ultra high molecular weight polyethylene]] materials are used as [[ski]] and [[snowboard]] base materials. The porous texture allows wax to be retained within the structure of the base material, thus providing a more durable wax coating.\n\n== Liquid phase sintering ==\n\nFor materials which are difficult to sinter, a process called liquid phase sintering is commonly used. Materials for which liquid phase sintering is common are [[Silicon nitride|Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>]], [[Tungsten carbide|WC]], [[Silicon carbide|SiC]], and more. Liquid phase sintering is the process of adding an additive to the powder which will melt before the matrix phase. The process of liquid phase sintering has three stages:\n\n*'''Rearrangement''' \u2013 As the liquid melts capillary action will pull the liquid into pores and also cause grains to rearrange into a more favorable packing arrangement.\n*'''Solution-Precipitation''' \u2013 In areas where capillary pressures are high (particles are close together) atoms will preferentially go into solution and then precipitate in areas of lower chemical potential where particles are not close or in contact. This is called \"''contact flattening''\". This densifies the system in a way similar to grain boundary diffusion in solid state sintering. [[Ostwald ripening]] will also occur where smaller particles will go into solution preferentially and precipitate on larger particles leading to densification.\n*'''Final Densification''' \u2013 densification of solid skeletal network, liquid movement from efficiently packed regions into pores.\n\nFor liquid phase sintering to be practical the major phase should be at least slightly soluble in the liquid phase and the additive should melt before any major sintering of the solid particulate network occurs, otherwise rearrangement of grains will not occur. Liquid phase sintering was successfully applied to improve [[grain growth]] of thin semiconductor layers from [[nanoparticle]] precursor films.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/pip.2529 |title=Liquid-selenium-enhanced grain growth of nanoparticle precursor layers for CuInSe<sub>2</sub> solar cell absorbers |year=2014 |last1=Uhl |first1=A.R.|journal=Prog.

G. Bloxam registered in 1906 the first [[patent]] on sintering powders using [[direct current]] in [[vacuum]]. The primary purpose of his inventions was the industrial scale production of filaments for [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent lamp]]s by compacting [[tungsten]] or [[molybdenum]] particles. The applied current was particularly effective in reducing surface [[oxide]]s that increased the [[emissivity]] of the filaments.<ref name=grasso/>\n\nIn 1913, Weintraub and Rush patented a modified sintering method which combined electric current with [[pressure]]. The benefits of this method were proved for the sintering of [[Refraction (metallurgy)|refractory metals]] as well as conductive [[carbide]] or [[nitride]] powders. The starting [[boron]]\u2013[[carbon]] or [[silicon]]\u2013carbon powders were placed in an [[Insulator (electrical)|electrically insulating]] tube and compressed by two rods which also served as [[electrode]]s for the current.

It is used for the production of diamond metal matrix composites and under evaluation for the production of hard metals,<ref>A.Fais Discharge sintering of hard metal cutting tools.

It is characterized by a very low sintering time allowing machines to sinter at the same speed as a compaction press.\n\n== Pressureless sintering ==\n\nPressureless sintering is the sintering of a powder compact (sometimes at very high temperatures, depending on the powder) without applied pressure. This avoids density variations in the final component, which occurs with more traditional hot pressing methods.<ref name=\"Microstructure Evolution\">{{cite journal|last1=Maca|first1=Karel|title=Microstructure evolution during pressureless sintering of bulk oxide ceramics|journal=Processing and Application of Ceramics|date=2009|volume=3|issue=1-2|pages=13\u201317|doi=10.2298/pac0902013m}}</ref>\n\nThe powder compact (if a ceramic) can be created by [[Slipcasting|slip casting]], [[injection moulding]], and [[Isostatic press|cold isostatic pressing]].  After pre-sintering, the final green compact can be machined to its final shape before sintered.\n\nThree different heating schedules can be performed with pressureless sintering: constant-rate of heating (CRH), rate-controlled sintering (RCS), and two-step sintering (TSS). The microstructure and grain size of the ceramics may vary depending on the material and method used.<ref name=\"Microstructure Evolution\"/>\n\nConstant-rate of heating (CRH), also known as temperature-controlled sintering, consists of heating the green compact at a constant rate up to the sintering temperature.<ref name=\"Effect of sintering\">{{cite journal|last1=Maca|first1=Karl|last2=Simonikova|first2=Sarka|title=Effect of sintering schedule on grain size of oxide ceramics|journal=Journal of Materials Science|date=2005|volume=40|pages=5581\u20135589|doi=10.1007/s10853-005-1332-1}}</ref> Experiments with zirconia have been performed to optimize the sintering temperature and sintering rate for CRH method. Results showed that the grain sizes were identical when the samples were sintered to the same density, proving that grain size is a function of specimen density rather than CRH temperature mode.\n\nIn rate-controlled sintering (RCS), the densification rate in the open-porosity phase is lower than in the CRH method.<ref name=\"Effect of sintering\"/> By definition, the relative density, \u03c1<sub>rel</sub>, in open-porosity phase is lower than 90%. Although this should prevent separation of pores from grain boundaries, it has been proven statistically that RCS did not produce smaller grain sizes than CRH for alumina, zirconia, and ceria samples.<ref name=\"Microstructure Evolution\"/>\n\nTwo-step sintering (TSS) uses two different sintering temperatures. The first sintering temperature should guarantee a relative density higher than 75% of theoretical sample density. This will remove supercritical pores from the body. The sample will then be cooled down and held at the second sintering temperature until densification is completed. Grains of cubic zirconia and cubic strontium titanate were significantly refined by TSS compared to CRH. However, the grain size changes in other ceramic materials, like tetragonal zirconia and hexagonal alumina, were not statistically significant.<ref name=\"Microstructure Evolution\"/>\n\n== Microwave sintering ==\nIn [[microwave]] sintering, heat is generated internally within the material, rather than via radiative heat transfer from an external heat source. Other benefits of microwave sintering are a better heat diffusion, less time needed to reach the sintering temperature, less heating energy required and improvements in the product properties.<ref name=\"OghbaeiMirzaee2010\">{{cite journal|last1=Oghbaei|first1=Morteza|last2=Mirzaee|first2=Omid|title=Microwave versus conventional sintering: A review of fundamentals, advantages and applications|journal=Journal of Alloys and Compounds|volume=494|issue=1-2|year=2010|pages=175\u2013189|issn=0925-8388|doi=10.1016/j.jallcom.2010.01.068}}</ref>\n\nAs microwaves can only penetrate a short distance in materials with a high [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] and a high [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]], microwave sintering requires the sample to be delivered in powders with a particle size around the penetration depth of microwaves in the particular material.

Densification is the act of reducing porosity in a sample thereby making it more dense. Grain growth is the process of grain boundary motion and [[Ostwald ripening]] to increase the average grain size. Many properties ([[mechanical strength]], electrical breakdown strength, etc.) benefit from both a high relative [[density]] and a small grain size. Therefore, being able to control these properties during processing is of high technical importance. Since densification of powders requires high temperatures, grain growth naturally occurs during sintering. Reduction of this process is key for many engineering ceramics.\n\nFor densification to occur at a quick pace it is essential to have (1) an amount of liquid phase that is large in size, (2) a near complete solubility of the solid in the liquid, and (3) wetting of the solid by the liquid. The power behind the densification is derived from the capillary pressure of the liquid phase located between the fine solid particles. When the liquid phase wets the solid particles, each space between the particles becomes a capillary in which a substantial capillary pressure is developed. For submicrometre particle sizes, capillaries with diameters in the range of 0.1 to 1 micrometres develop pressures in the range of {{convert|175|psi}} to {{convert|1750|psi}} for silicate liquids and in the range of {{convert|975|psi}} to {{convert|9750|psi}} for a metal such as liquid cobalt.<ref name=Kingery/>\n\nDensification requires constant [[capillary pressure]] where just solution-precipitation material transfer would not produce densification. For further densification, additional particle movement while the particle undergoes grain-growth and grain-shape changes occurs. Shrinkage would result when the liquid slips between particles and increase pressure at points of contact causing the material to move away from the contact areas forcing particle centers to draw near each other.<ref name=Kingery/>\n\nThe sintering of liquid-phase materials involves a fine-grained solid phase to create the needed capillary pressures proportional to its diameter and the liquid concentration must also create the required capillary pressure within range, else the process ceases. The vitrification rate is dependent upon the pore size, the viscosity and amount of liquid phase present leading to the viscosity of the overall composition, and the surface tension. Temperature dependence for densification controls the process because at higher temperatures viscosity decreases and increases liquid content. Therefore, when changes to the composition and processing are made, it will affect the vitrification process.<ref name=Kingery/>\n\n=== Sintering mechanisms ===\n\nSintering occurs by diffusion of atoms through the microstructure. This diffusion is caused by a gradient of chemical potential \u2013 atoms move from an area of higher chemical potential to an area of lower chemical potential. The different paths the atoms take to get from one spot to another are the sintering mechanisms. The six common mechanisms are:\n\n*Surface diffusion \u2013 Diffusion of atoms along the surface of a particle\n*Vapor transport \u2013 Evaporation of atoms which condense on a different surface\n*Lattice diffusion from surface \u2013 atoms from surface diffuse through lattice\n*Lattice diffusion from grain boundary \u2013 atom from grain boundary diffuses through lattice\n*Grain boundary diffusion \u2013 atoms diffuse along grain boundary\n*Plastic deformation \u2013 dislocation motion causes flow of matter\n\nAlso one must distinguish between densifying and non-densifying mechanisms. 1\u20133 above are non-densifying{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} \u2013 they take atoms from the surface and rearrange them onto another surface or part of the same surface. These mechanisms simply rearrange matter inside of porosity and do not cause pores to shrink. Mechanisms 4\u20136 are densifying mechanisms{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} \u2013 atoms are moved from the bulk to the surface of pores thereby eliminating porosity and increasing the density of the sample.\n\n=== Grain growth ===\n\n{{main|Grain growth}}\n\nA [[grain boundary]](GB) is the transition area or interface between adjacent [[crystallites]] (or [[Food grain|grain]]s) of the same chemical and [[crystal lattice|lattice]] composition, not to be confused with a [[phase boundary]]. The adjacent grains do not have the same orientation of the lattice thus giving the atoms in GB shifted positions relative to the lattice in the [[crystal]]s. Due to the shifted positioning of the atoms in the GB they have a higher energy state when compared with the atoms in the crystal lattice of the grains. It is this imperfection that makes it possible to selectively etch the GBs when one wants the microstructure visible.<ref name=Smallman>{{cite book|last=Smallman R.

[[Abnormal grain growth]] is when a few grains grow much larger than the remaining majority.<ref name=\"Fundamentals of Materials Science\">{{cite book|last=Mittemeijer|first=Eric J.|title=Fundamentals of Materials Science The Microstructure\u2013Property Relationship Using Metals as Model Systems|year=2010|publisher=Springer Heidelberg Dordrecht London New York|isbn=978-3-642-10499-2|pages=463\u2013496}}</ref>\n\n==== Grain boundary energy/tension ====\n\nThe atoms in the GB are normally in a higher energy state than their equivalent in the bulk material. This is due to their more stretched bonds, which gives rise to a GB tension <math>\\sigma_{GB}</math>. This extra energy that the atoms possess is called the grain boundary energy,  <math>\\gamma_{GB}</math>. The grain will want to minimize this extra energy thus striving to make the grain boundary area smaller and this change requires energy.<ref name=\"Fundamentals of Materials Science\" />\n\n\u201cOr, in other words, a force has to be applied, in the plane of the grain boundary and acting along a line in the grain-boundary area, in order to extend the grain-boundary area in the direction of the force. The force per unit length, i.e. tension/stress, along the line mentioned is \u03c3GB. On the basis of this reasoning it would follow:\n\n<math>\\sigma_{GB} dA  \\text{ (work done)} = \\gamma_{GB} dA \\text{ (energy change)}\\,\\!</math>\n \nwith dA as the increase of grain-boundary area per unit length along the line in the grain-boundary area considered.\u201d<ref name=\"Fundamentals of Materials Science\" /> [pg 478]\n\nThe GB tension can also be thought of as the attractive forces between the atoms at the surface and the tension between these atoms is due to the fact that there is a larger interatomic distance between them at the surface compared to the bulk (i.e. [[surface tension]]). When the surface area becomes bigger the bonds stretch more and the GB tension increases. To counteract this increase in tension there must be a transport of atoms to the surface keeping the GB tension constant. This diffusion of atoms accounts for the constant surface tension in liquids. Then the argument,\n\n<math>\\sigma_{GB} dA  \\text{ (work done)} = \\gamma_{GB} dA \\text{ (energy change)}\\,\\!</math>\n\nholds true. For solids, on the other hand, diffusion of atoms to the surface might not be sufficient and the surface tension can vary with an increase in surface area.<ref name=Sintering>{{cite book|last=Kang|first=Suk-Joong L.|title=Sintering: Densification, Grain Growth, and Microstructure|year=2005|publisher=Elsevier Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7506-6385-4|pages=9\u201318}}</ref>\nFor a solid, one can derive an expression for the change in Gibbs free energy, dG, upon the change of GB area, dA. dG is given by\n\n<math>\\sigma_{GB} dA \\text{ (work done)} = dG \\text{ (energy change)} = \\gamma_{GB} dA + A d\\gamma_{GB}\\,\\!</math>\n\nwhich gives\n \n<math>\\sigma_{GB} = \\gamma_{GB} + \\frac{Ad\\gamma_{GB}}{dA}\\,\\!</math>\n\n<math>\\sigma_{GB}</math> is normally expressed in units of <math>\\frac{N}{m}</math> while <math>\\gamma_{GB}</math> is normally expressed in units of <math>\\frac{J}{m^2}</math> <math>(J = Nm)</math> since they are different physical properties.<ref name=\"Fundamentals of Materials Science\" />\n\n==== Mechanical equilibrium ====\n\nIn a two-dimensional [[isotropic material]] the grain boundary tension would be the same for the grains. This would give angle of 120\u00b0 at GB junction where three grains meet. This would give the structure a [[hexagonal]] pattern which is the [[metastable]] state (or [[mechanical equilibrium]]) of the 2D specimen. A consequence of this is that to keep trying to be as close to the equilibrium as possible. Grains with fewer sides than six will bend the GB to try keep the 120\u00b0 angle between each other. This results in a curved boundary with its [[curvature]] towards itself. A grain with six sides will, as mentioned, have straight boundaries while a grain with more than six sides will have curved boundaries with its curvature away from itself. A grain with six boundaries (i.e. hexagonal structure) are in a metastable state (i.e. local equilibrium) within the 2D structure.<ref name=\"Fundamentals of Materials Science\" />  In three dimensions structural details are similar but much more complex and the [[metastable]] structure for a grain is a non-regular 14-sided [[polyhedra]] with doubly curved faces. In practice all arrays of grains are always unstable and thus always grows until its prevented by a counterforce.<ref name=\"Physical Metallurgy ch 28\">{{cite book|last=Robert W.

Convex surfaces have a higher chemical potential than concave surfaces therefore grain boundaries will move toward their center of curvature. As smaller particles tend to have a higher radius of curvature and this results in smaller grains losing atoms to larger grains and shrinking. This is a process called Ostwald ripening. Large grains grow at the expense of small grains.\nGrain growth in a simple model is found to follow:\n\n<math>G^m= G_0^m+Kt</math>\n\nHere ''G'' is final average grain size, ''G<sub>0</sub>'' is the initial average grain size, ''t'' is time, ''m'' is a factor between 2 and 4, and ''K'' is a factor given by:\n\n<math>K= K_0 e^{\\frac{-Q}{RT}}</math>\n\nHere ''Q'' is the molar activation energy, ''R'' is the ideal gas constant, ''T'' is absolute temperature, and ''K<sub>0</sub>'' is a material dependent factor.\n\n=== Reducing grain growth ===\n\n;Solute ions\n\nIf a [[dopant]] is added to the material (example: Nd in BaTiO<sub>3</sub>) the impurity will tend to stick to the grain boundaries. As the grain boundary tries to move (as atoms jump from the convex to concave surface) the change in concentration of the dopant at the grain boundary will impose a drag on the boundary. The original concentration of solute around the grain boundary will be asymmetrical in most cases. As the grain boundary tries to move the concentration on the side opposite of motion will have a higher concentration and therefore have a higher chemical potential. This increased chemical potential will act as a backforce to the original chemical potential gradient that is the reason for grain boundary movement. This decrease in net chemical potential will decrease the grain boundary velocity and therefore grain growth.\n\n;Fine second phase particles\n\nIf particles of a second phase which are insoluble in the matrix phase are added to the powder in the form of a much finer powder than this will decrease grain boundary movement. When the grain boundary tries to move past the inclusion diffusion of atoms from one grain to the other will be hindered by the insoluble particle. Since it is beneficial for particles to reside in the grain boundaries and they exert a force in opposite direction compared to the grain boundary migration. This effect is called the Zener effect after the man who estimated this drag force to\n\n<math> F = \\pi r \\lambda \\sin (2\\theta)\\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere r is the radius of the particle and \u03bb the interfacial energy of the boundary if there are N particles per unit volume their volume fraction f is\n\n<math> f = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 N\\,\\!</math>\n\nassuming they are randomly distributed. A boundary of unit area will intersect all particles within a volume of 2r which is 2Nr particles. So the number of particles n intersecting a unit area of grain boundary is:\n\n<math>n = \\frac{3f}{2 \\pi r^2}\\,\\!</math>\n\nNow assuming that the grains only grow due to the influence of curvature, the driving force of growth is <math>\\frac{2 \\lambda}{R} </math> where (for homogeneous grain structure) R approximates to the mean diameter of the grains. With this the critical diameter that has to be reached before the grains ceases to grow:\n\n<math>n F_{max} = \\frac{2 \\lambda}{D_{crit}}\\,\\!</math>\n\nThis can be reduced to\n<math>D_{crit} = \\frac{4r}{3f} \\,\\!</math> \nso the critical diameter of the grains is  dependent of the size and volume fraction of the particles at the grain boundaries.<ref name=\"Physical Metallurgy\">{{cite book|last=Robert W.

It sometimes forms conical mounds, called geyser cones, but can also form as a [[Terrace (geology)|terrace]]. The main agents responsible for the deposition of siliceous sinter are [[algae]] and other vegetation in the water. Altering of wall rocks can also form sinters near [[fumarole]]s and in the deeper channels of [[hot spring]]s. Examples of siliceous sinter are [[geyserite]] and [[fiorite]]. They can be found in many places, including  [[Iceland]], [[El Tatio]] geothermal field in [[Chile]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Yellowstone National Park]] and [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado|Steamboat Springs]] in the USA.\n\n[[Calcareous sinter]] is also called [[tufa]], calcareous tufa, or calc-tufa. It is a deposit of [[calcium carbonate]], as with [[travertine]]. Called petrifying springs, they are quite common in limestone districts. Their calcareous waters deposit a sintery incrustation on surrounding objects. The precipitation is assisted with mosses and other vegetable structures, thus leaving cavities in the calcareous sinter after they have decayed.<ref name=\"britanica\"/>\n\nPetrifying spring at [[Pamukkale]], [[Turkey]]:\n<gallery>\nImage:Pamukkale3.jpg\nImage:Pamukkale1.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Sintering of catalysts==\nSintering is an important cause for loss of [[catalyst]] activity, especially on supported metal catalysts.
