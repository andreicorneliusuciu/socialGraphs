Some recipes might have the vegetables tossed in ground [[peanut]]s. ''Acar'' is commonly served as a condiment to be eaten with a main course, such as ''[[nasi goreng]]'' (fried rice), [[satay]], and almost all varieties of ''[[Soto (food)|soto]]''.<ref name=\"DCQ\"/> Just like common [[List of pickled foods|pickle]]s, the sour taste of ''acar'' is meant to freshen up a meal, especially fishy dishes such as ''[[ikan bakar]]'' (grilled fish) or the rich and oily dish such as ''[[Satay#Sate kambing|mutton satay]]'' to neutralize the fat.\n\n==Regional cuisines==\nIn [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesia]], acar is commonly made from small chunks of cucumber, carrot, shallot, bird's eye chili and occasionally pineapple, and marinated in a sweet and sour solution of sugar and vinegar. Some households add lemongrass or ginger to spice it up.<ref>{{cite web|title=Acar \u2013 Indonesian Pickle Ingredients|url=http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/2800/acar-cucumber-pickles.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2 June 2014}}</ref> It is usually used as condiment to accompany grilled foods such as [[satay]]. Nevertheless, ''acar'' is can also be consumed as a whole, complete dish. For example, ''ikan acar kuning'' is a fish dish  ([[gourami]], [[mackerel]] or [[tilapia]]) served in ''acar'' pickles of cucumber, carrot, shallot and red chili, mixed with yellow spice paste made of ground turmeric, candlenut, ginger, garlic and shallot.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ikan Nila Acar Kuning|first=Farah|last=Quinn|url=http://www.farahquinn.com/recipe/ikan-nila-acar-kuning/|language=Indonesian|accessdate=9 February 2015}}</ref> It is known as ''atjar'' (pickle) in [[Dutch cuisine]], derived from Indonesian ''acar'', since the Netherlands and Indonesia share colonial ties.\n\nVariations of Malaysian ''acar'' include ''Acar Awak'' or [[Peranakan cuisine|Nyonya]] acar and [[Malay people|Malay]] ''acar''. ''Acar Awak'' is more elaborate, containing additional vegetables such as [[eggplant]]s as well as aromatic spices in the pickling mix.\n\nThe salad has also been adopted into [[Thai cuisine]] where it is called [[Thai salads#Other Thai salads|achat]] ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e08\u0e32\u0e14}}, {{IPA-th|\u0294\u0101\u02d0.t\u0361\u0255\u00e0\u02d0t|pron}}). It is made with cucumber, red chilies, red onions or shallots, vinegar, sugar and salt. It is served as a side dish with the Thai version of [[satay]] ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e30\u0e40\u0e15\u0e4a\u0e30}}).\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Acar}}\n*[[Atchara]] ([[Philippine cuisine]])\n*[[Achaar (pickle)]] [[Indian cuisine]]\n*[[Thai salads]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n{{Indonesian cuisine}}\n{{Malaysian cuisine}}\n\n\n{{portal bar|Food}}\n\n[[Category:Salads]]\n[[Category:Indonesian pickles]]\n[[Category:Malay cuisine]]\n[[Category:Malaysian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Singaporean cuisine]]\n[[Category:Malay words and phrases]]\n[[Category:Thai cuisine]]\n[[Category:Vegetarian dishes of Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Vegetable dishes of Indonesia]]\n\n\n{{Condiment-stub}}"}]}}}}
