This determines the amount of [[electric current]] a wire can [[safety|safely]] carry, as well as its [[electrical resistance]] and [[weight]] per [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[length]].  Wire gauge is applicable to both electrical and non-electrical wires, being important to [[electrical wiring]] and to structural cable.\n\n==Types of wire gauge ==\nWire Gauges may be broadly divided into two groups, the [[empirical]] and the [[geometric]]. The first includes all the older gauge measurements, notably the [[Stubs Iron Wire Gauge|Birmingham]] (B.W.G. or Stubs) and the [[Lancashire]]. The origin of the B.W.G. is obscure. The numbers of wire were in common use earlier than 1735. It is believed that they originally were based on the series of drawn wires, No. 1 being the original rod, and succeeding numbers corresponding with each draw, so that No. 10, for example, would have passed ten times through the [[draw plate]]. But the Birmingham and the Lancashire gauge, the latter being based on an averaging of the dimensions collated from a large number of the former in the possession of Peter Stubs of Warrington, have long held the leading position, and are still retained and used probably to a greater extent than the more recent geometrical gauges.\n\nThe first attempt to adopt a geometrical system was made by Messrs [[Brown & Sharpe]] in 1855. They established a regular progression of thirty-nine steps between the English sizes, No. 0000 (460 [[Thousandth of an inch|mils]] or about 12&nbsp;mm) and No. 36 (5 mils or about 0.13&nbsp;mm). Each diameter was multiplied by 0.890526 to give the next lower size. This is now the [[American wire gauge]] (AWG), and is used to a considerable extent in the United States.\n\nThe Imperial [[Standard Wire Gauge]], which has been sanctioned by the British Board of Trade, was formulated by J. Latimer Clark. Following one of its recommendations, it differs from pre-existing gauges scarcely more than they differ among themselves, and is based on a rational system, the basis being the [[circular mil|mil]]. No. 7/0, the largest size, is 0.50 in. (500 mils or 12.7&nbsp;mm) in diameter, and the smallest, No. 50, is 0.001 in. (1 mil or about 25&nbsp;\u00b5m) in diameter. Between these the diameter, or thickness, diminishes by 10.557%, and the weight diminishes by 20%.\n\nNone of the above systems of measurement are part of the [[metric system]].\n\nThe current [[British Standard]] for metallic materials including wire is [[BS 6722]]:1986, which is a solely [[metric system|metric]] standard, superseding 3737:1964, which used the SWG system.\n\n==Measuring==\nIn commerce, the sizes of wire are estimated by a device, also called [[Gauge (engineering)|gauges]], which consist of plates of circular or oblong form having notches of different widths around their edges to receive wire and sheet metals of different thicknesses. Each notch is stamped with a number, and the wire or sheet, which just fits a given notch, is stated to be of, say, No. 10, 11, 12, etc., of the wire gauge.\n\nThe circular forms of wire gauge measurement devices are the most popular, and are generally 3\u00be in. (95&nbsp;mm) in diameter, with thirty-six notches; many have the decimal equivalents of the sizes stamped on the back. Oblong plates are similarly notched. Rolling mill gauges are also oblong in form. Many gauges are made with a wedge-like slot into which the wire is thrust; one edge being graduated, the point at which the movement of the wire is arrested gives its size. The graduations are those of standard wire, or in thousandths of an inch. In some cases both edges are graduated differently in order to allow comparison between two systems of measurement. A few gauges are made with holes into which the wire has to be thrust. All gauges are hardened and ground to dimensions.\n\nIn some applications wire sizes are specified as the cross sectional area of the wire, usually in mm\u00b2. Advantages of this system include the ability to readily calculate the physical dimensions or weight of wire, ability to take account of non-circular wire, and ease of [[calculation]] of electrical properties.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Media:Gauge Chart.pdf|Wire gauge comparison chart]]\n*[[IEC 60228]], the metric wire-size standard used in most parts of the world.\n*[[Circular mil]], Electrical industry standard for wires larger than 4/0.\n*[[American wire gauge|American Wire Gauge (AWG)]], used primarily in the US and Canada\n*[[Standard wire gauge|Standard Wire Gauge (SWG)]], the British imperial standard BS3737, superseded by the metric.\n*[[Jewelry wire gauge]]\n*[[Body jewelry sizes]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.66pacific.com/calculators/wire_calc.aspx Wire Gauge to Diameter\u2014Diameter to Wire Gauge Converter] - Online calculator converts gauge to diameter or diameter to gauge for any wire size.\n*[http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-cross-section.htm Calculation: round electric cable diameter to circle cross-sectional area and vice versa]\n*[http://www.dave-cushman.net/elect/wiregauge.html Wire gauge conversion chart]\n*[http://www.kayelaby.npl.co.uk/miscellaneous_engineering_data/5_2/5_2.html Standard wire sizes], Kaye & Laby, NPL\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wire Gauge}}\n[[Category:Wire gauges| ]]"}]}}}}
