The capacitor is charged by the input source causing the voltage across the capacitor to rise. The threshold device does not conduct at all until the capacitor voltage reaches its threshold (trigger) voltage. It then increases heavily its conductance in an avalanche-like manner because of the inherent positive feedback, which quickly discharges the capacitor. When the voltage across the capacitor drops to some lower threshold voltage, the device stops conducting and the capacitor begins charging again, and the cycle repeats [[ad infinitum]].\n\nIf the threshold element is a [[neon lamp]],<ref group=\"nb\">When a (neon) cathode glow lamp or thyratron are used as the trigger devices a second resistor with a value of a few tens to hundreds ohms is often placed in series with the gas trigger device to limit the current from the discharging capacitor and prevent the electrodes of the lamp rapidly [[sputter]]ing away or the cathode coating of the thyratron being damaged by the repeated pulses of heavy current.</ref><ref group=\"nb\">Trigger devices with a third control connection, such as the thyratron or unijunction transistor allow the timing of the discharge of the capacitor to be synchronized with a control pulse. Thus the sawtooth output can be synchronized to signals produced by other circuit elements as it is often used as a scan waveform for a display, such as a [[cathode ray tube]].</ref> the circuit also provides a flash of light with each discharge of the capacitor. This lamp example is depicted below in the typical circuit used to describe the [[Pearson&ndash;Anson effect]]. The discharging duration can be extended by connecting an additional resistor in series to the threshold element. The two resistors form a voltage divider; so, the additional resistor has to have low enough resistance to reach the low threshold.\n\n=== Alternative implementation with 555 timer ===\n\nA similar relaxation oscillator can be built with a [[555 timer|555 timer IC]] (acting in astable mode) that takes the place of the neon bulb above. That is, when a chosen capacitor is charged to a design value, (e.g., 2/3 of the power supply voltage) [[comparator]]s within the 555 timer flip a transistor switch that gradually discharges that capacitor through a chosen resistor (RC Time Constant) to ground. At the instant the capacitor falls to a sufficiently low value (e.g., 1/3 of the power supply voltage), the switch flips to let the capacitor charge up again. The popular 555's comparator design permits accurate operation with any supply from 5 to 15 volts or even wider.\n\nOther, non-comparator oscillators may have unwanted timing changes if the supply voltage changes.\n\n== Comparator&ndash;based relaxation oscillator ==\n\nAlternatively, when the capacitor reaches each threshold, the charging source can be switched from the positive power supply to the negative power supply or vice versa. This case is shown in the [[comparator]]-based implementation here.\n\n[[Image:OpAmpHystereticOscillator.svg|thumb|A comparator-based hysteretic oscillator.]]\n\nThis relaxation oscillator is a hysteretic oscillator, named this way because of the [[hysteresis]] created by the [[positive feedback]] loop implemented with the [[comparator]] (similar to, but different from, an [[operational amplifier|op-amp]]). A circuit that implements this form of hysteretic switching is known as a [[Schmitt trigger]]. Alone, the trigger is a [[bistable multivibrator]]. However, the slow [[negative feedback]] added to the trigger by the RC circuit causes the circuit to oscillate automatically. That is, the addition of the RC circuit turns the hysteretic bistable [[multivibrator]] into an [[astable multivibrator]].\n\n=== General Concept ===\nThe system is in unstable equilibrium if both the inputs and outputs of the comparator are at zero volts. The moment any sort of noise, be it thermal or [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] [[noise]] brings the output of the comparator above zero (the case of the comparator output going below zero is also possible, and a similar argument to what follows applies), the positive feedback in the comparator results in the output of the comparator saturating at the positive rail.\n\nIn other words, because the output of the comparator is now positive, the non-inverting input to the comparator is also positive, and continues to increase as the output increases, due to the [[voltage divider]].  After a short time, the output of the comparator is the positive voltage rail, <math>V_{DD}</math>.\n\n[[Image:Series-RC.svg|thumb|Series RC Circuit]]\n\nThe inverting input and the output of the comparator are linked by a [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]] [[RC circuit]].  Because of this, the inverting input of the comparator asymptotically approaches the comparator output voltage with a [[time constant]] RC.  At the point where voltage at the inverting input is greater than the non-inverting input, the output of the comparator falls quickly due to positive feedback.\n\nThis is because the non-inverting input is less than the inverting input, and as the output continues to decrease, the difference between the inputs gets more and more negative. Again, the inverting input approaches the comparator's output voltage asymptotically, and the cycle repeats itself once the non-inverting input is greater than the inverting input, hence the system oscillates.\n\n=== Example: Differential Equation Analysis of comparator-based Relaxation Oscillator ===\n\n[[Image:opamprelaxationoscillator.svg|thumb|300px|Transient analysis of a comparator-based relaxation oscillator.]]\n\n<math>\\, \\!

Ignoring the initial charge up of the capacitor, which is irrelevant for calculations of the frequency, note that charges and discharges oscillate between <math>\\frac{V_{dd}}{2}</math> and <math>\\frac{V_{ss}}{2}</math>.  For the circuit above, V<sub>ss</sub> must be less than 0. Half of the period (T) is the same as time that <math>V_{out}</math> switches from V<sub>dd</sub>. This occurs when V<sub>-</sub> charges up from <math>-\\frac{V_{dd}}{2}</math> to <math>\\frac{V_{dd}}{2}</math>.\n\n:<math>V_-=A+Be^{\\frac{-1}{RC}t}</math>\n\n:<math>\\frac{V_{dd}}{2}=V_{dd}\\left(1-\\frac{3}{2}e^{\\frac{-1}{RC}\\frac{T}{2}}\\right)</math>\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{3}=e^{\\frac{-1}{RC}\\frac{T}{2}}</math>\n\n:<math>\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)=\\frac{-1}{RC}\\frac{T}{2}</math>\n\n:<math>\\, \\!
