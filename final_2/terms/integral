Integration is one of the two main operations of [[calculus]], with its inverse, [[derivative|differentiation]], being the other. Given a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{mvar|f}} of a [[Real number|real]] [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] {{mvar|x}} and an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} of the [[real line]], the '''definite integral'''\n\n: <math>\\int_a^b \\! f(x)\\,dx</math>\n\nis defined informally as the signed [[area (geometry)|area]] of the region in the {{mvar|xy}}-plane that is bounded by the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of {{mvar|f}}, the {{mvar|x}}-axis and the vertical lines {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''a''}} and {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''b''}}. The area above the {{mvar|x}}-axis adds to the total and that below the {{mvar|x}}-axis subtracts from the total.\n\nRoughly speaking, the operation of integration is the reverse of differentiation.  For this reason, the term ''integral'' may also refer to the related notion of the [[antiderivative]], a function {{mvar|F}} whose [[derivative]] is the given function {{mvar|f}}. In this case, it is called an ''[[indefinite integral]]'' and is written:\n:<math>F(x) = \\int f(x)\\,dx.</math>\n\nThe integrals discussed in this article are those termed ''definite integrals''.  It is the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] that connects differentiation with the definite integral: if {{mvar|f}} is a continuous real-valued function defined on a [[closed interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, then, once an antiderivative {{mvar|F}} of {{mvar|f}} is known, the definite integral of {{mvar|f}} over that interval is given by\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b \\! f(x)\\,dx = F(b) - F(a).</math>\n\nThe principles of integration were formulated independently by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in the late 17th century, who thought of the integral as an infinite sum of rectangles of [[infinitesimal]] width. A rigorous mathematical definition of the integral was given by [[Bernhard Riemann]]. It is based on a limiting procedure which approximates the area of a [[curvilinear]] region by breaking the region into thin vertical slabs. Beginning in the nineteenth century, more sophisticated notions of integrals began to appear, where the type of the function as well as the [[Domain of a function|domain]] over which the integration is performed has been generalised. A [[line integral]] is defined for functions of two or three variables, and the interval of integration {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is replaced by a certain [[curve]] connecting two points on the plane or in the space. In a [[surface integral]], the curve is replaced by a piece of a [[surface]] in the three-dimensional space.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of calculus}}\n\n===Pre-calculus integration===\nThe first documented systematic technique capable of determining integrals is the [[method of exhaustion]] of the [[ancient Greek]] astronomer [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] (''ca.'' 370 BC), which sought to find areas and volumes by breaking them up into an infinite number of divisions for which the area or volume was known. This method was further developed and employed by [[Archimedes]] in the 3rd century BC and used to calculate areas for [[parabola]]s and an approximation to the area of a circle.\n\nA similar method was independently developed in China around the 3rd century AD by [[Liu Hui]], who used it to find the area of the circle. This method was later used in the 5th century by Chinese father-and-son mathematicians [[Zu Chongzhi]] and [[Zu Geng (mathematician)|Zu Geng]] to find the volume of a sphere ({{harvnb|Shea | 2007}}; {{harvnb|Katz|2004|pp=125\u2013126}}).\n\nThe next significant advances in integral calculus did not begin to appear until the 17th century. At this time the work of [[Bonaventura Cavalieri|Cavalieri]] with his [[method of Indivisibles]], and work by [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]], began to lay the foundations of modern calculus, with Cavalieri computing the integrals of {{math|''x''<sup>''n''</sup>}} up to degree {{math|''n'' {{=}} 9}} in [[Cavalieri's quadrature formula]]. Further steps were made in the early 17th century by [[Isaac Barrow|Barrow]] and [[Evangelista Torricelli|Torricelli]], who provided the first hints of a connection between integration and [[Differential calculus|differentiation]]. Barrow provided the first proof of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]].  [[John Wallis|Wallis]] generalized Cavalieri's method, computing integrals of {{mvar|x}} to a general power, including negative powers and fractional powers.\n\n===Newton and Leibniz===\nThe major advance in integration came in the 17th century with the independent discovery of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]. The theorem demonstrates a connection between integration and differentiation. This connection, combined with the comparative ease of differentiation, can be exploited to calculate integrals. In particular, the fundamental theorem of calculus allows one to solve a much broader class of problems. Equal in importance is the comprehensive mathematical framework that both Newton and Leibniz developed. Given the name infinitesimal calculus, it allowed for precise analysis of functions within continuous domains. This framework eventually became modern [[calculus]], whose notation for integrals is drawn directly from the work of Leibniz.\n<!--- Please, do not remove: helpful for verification\nThe last sentence originally said 'work of Newton and Leibniz', but for integrals, only Leibniz's notation is used. --->\n\n===Formalization===\nWhile Newton and Leibniz provided a systematic approach to integration, their work lacked a degree of [[Rigor#Mathematical rigour|rigour]]. [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]] memorably attacked the vanishing increments used by Newton, calling them \"[[The Analyst#Content|ghosts of departed quantities]]\". Calculus acquired a firmer footing with the development of [[Limit (mathematics)|limits]].  Integration was first rigorously formalized, using limits, by [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]]. Although all bounded piecewise continuous functions are Riemann-integrable on a bounded interval, subsequently more general functions were considered\u2014particularly in the context of [[Fourier analysis]]\u2014to which Riemann's definition does not apply, and [[Henri Lebesgue|Lebesgue]] formulated a different definition of integral, founded in [[Measure (mathematics)|measure theory]] (a subfield of [[real analysis]]). Other definitions of integral, extending Riemann's and Lebesgue's approaches, were proposed.  These approaches based on the real number system are the ones most common today, but alternative approaches exist, such as a definition of integral as the [[standard part]] of an infinite Riemann sum, based on the [[hyperreal number]] system.\n\n===Historical notation===\n[[Isaac Newton]] used a small vertical bar above a variable to indicate integration, or placed the variable inside a box. The vertical bar was easily confused with {{math|{{overset|'''.'''|''x''}}}} or {{math|''x''\u2032}}, which Newton used to indicate differentiation, and the box notation was difficult for printers to reproduce, so these notations were not widely adopted.\n\nThe modern notation for the indefinite integral was introduced by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in 1675 ({{Harvnb|Burton|1988|loc=p.&nbsp;359}}; {{Harvnb|Leibniz|1899|loc=p.&nbsp;154}}). He adapted the [[integral symbol]], '''\u222b''', from the letter ''\u017f'' ([[long s]]), standing for ''summa'' (written as ''\u017fumma''; Latin for \"sum\" or \"total\"). The modern notation for the definite integral, with limits above and below the integral sign, was first used by [[Joseph Fourier]] in ''M\u00e9moires'' of the French Academy around 1819\u201320, reprinted in his book of 1822 ({{Harvnb|Cajori|1929|loc=pp.&nbsp;249\u2013250}}; {{Harvnb|Fourier|1822|loc=\u00a7231}}).\n\n==Terminology and notation==\n\n===Standard===\nThe integral with respect to {{mvar|x}} of a [[real-valued function]] {{math|''f''(''x'')}} of a real variable {{mvar|x}} on the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is written as\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx</math>.\n\nThe integral sign {{math|\u222b}} represents integration. The symbol {{mvar|dx}}, called the [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] of the variable {{mvar|x}}, indicates that the variable of integration is {{mvar|x}}.  The function {{math|''f''(''x'')}} to be integrated is called the integrand.  The symbol {{mvar|dx}} is separated from the integrand by a space (as shown).  If a function has an integral, it is said to be integrable.  The points {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b|}} are called the limits of the integral.  An integral where the limits are specified is called a definite integral.  The integral is said to be over the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}.\n\nWhen the limits are omitted, as in\n:<math>\\int f(x) \\,dx,</math>\nthe integral is called an indefinite integral (also known as [[antiderivative]]).  The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] relates indefinite integrals and definite integrals.  There are many [[#Extensions|extensions]] of this notation to generalizations of the integral.\n\n===Variants===\nIn [[modern Arabic mathematical notation]], a reflected integral symbol [[File:ArabicIntegralSign.svg|16px]] is used instead of the symbol {{math|\u222b}}.<ref>{{Harv|W3C|2006}}.</ref>  Some authors use an upright \"d\" to indicate the variable of integration (i.e., {{math|d''x''}} instead of {{math|''dx''}}). The symbol {{mvar|dx}} is not always placed after {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, as for instance in\n:<math>\\int\\limits_0^1 \\frac{3\\ dx}{x^2+1}</math>.\n\n==Interpretations of the integral==\nIntegrals appear in many practical situations. If a swimming pool is rectangular with a flat bottom, then from its length, width, and depth we can easily determine the volume of water it can contain (to fill it), the area of its surface (to cover it), and the length of its edge (to rope it). But if it is oval with a rounded bottom, all of these quantities call for integrals. Practical approximations may suffice for such trivial examples, but [[precision engineering]] (of any discipline) requires exact and rigorous values for these elements.\n\n[[File:Integral approximations.svg|thumb|right|Approximations to integral of \u221a<span style=\"text-decoration:overline\">{{mvar|x}}</span> from 0 to 1, with 5 <span style=\"color:#fec200\">\u25a0</span>&nbsp; (yellow) right endpoint partitions and 12 <span style=\"color:#009246\">\u25a0</span>&nbsp; (green) left endpoint partitions|alt=Integral approximation example]]\nTo start off, consider the curve {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} between {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1}} with {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} {{sqrt|''x''}}}} (see figure). We ask:\n:What is the area under the function {{mvar|f}}, in the interval from 0 to 1?\nand call this (yet unknown) area the (definite) '''integral''' of {{mvar|f}}. The notation for this integral will be\n:<math>\\int\\limits_0^1 \\sqrt{x}\\ dx.</math>\n\nAs a first approximation, look at the unit square given by the sides {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} to {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(0) {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(1) {{=}} 1}}. Its area is exactly 1. As it is, the true value of the integral must be somewhat less than 1. Decreasing the width of the approximation rectangles and increasing the number of rectangles shall give a better result; so cross the interval in five steps, using the approximation points 0, 1/5, 2/5, and so on to 1. Fit a box for each step using the right end height of each curve piece, thus {{math|{{sqrt|1/5}}}}, {{math|{{sqrt|2/5}}}}, and so on to {{math|{{sqrt|1}} {{=}} 1}}. Summing the areas of these rectangles, we get a better approximation for the sought integral, namely\n:<math>\\textstyle \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{5}}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}-0\\right)+\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{5}}\\left(\\frac{2}{5}-\\frac{1}{5}\\right)+\\cdots+\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{5}}\\left(\\frac{5}{5}-\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\approx 0.7497.</math>\n\nWe are taking a sum of finitely many function values of {{mvar|f}}, multiplied with the differences of two subsequent approximation points. We can easily see that the approximation is still too large. Using more steps produces a closer approximation, but will never be exact: replacing the 5 subintervals by twelve in the same way, but with the left end height of each piece, we will get an approximate value for the area of 0.6203, which is too small. The key idea is the transition from adding ''finitely many'' differences of approximation points multiplied by their respective function values to using infinitely many fine, or ''[[infinitesimal]]'' steps.\n\nThe notation\n:<math>\\int f(x)\\ dx</math>\nconceives the integral as a weighted sum, denoted by the elongated {{mvar|s}}, of function values, {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, multiplied by infinitesimal step widths, the so-called ''differentials'', denoted by {{mvar|dx}}. The multiplication sign is usually omitted.\n\n<!-- Note: Today's limits of integration were not part of the notation until much later, due to Fourier. -->Historically, after the failure of early efforts to rigorously interpret infinitesimals, Riemann formally defined integrals as a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of weighted sums, so that the {{mvar|dx}} suggested the limit of a difference (namely, the interval width). Shortcomings of Riemann's dependence on intervals and continuity motivated newer definitions, especially the [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integral]], which is founded on an ability to extend the idea of \"measure\" in much more flexible ways. Thus the notation\n:<math>\\int_A f(x)\\ d\\mu</math>\nrefers to a weighted sum in which the function values are partitioned, with {{mvar|\u03bc}} measuring the weight to be assigned to each value. Here {{mvar|A}} denotes the region of integration.\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 300\n<!-- Extra parameters -->\n| header = Darboux sums\n| header_align = center\n| header_background = \n| footer = \n| footer_align = \n| footer_background = \n| background color =\n\n|image1=Riemann Integration and Darboux Upper Sums.gif\n|width1=300\n|caption1=<div class=\"center\" style=\"width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\">Darboux upper sums of the function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup></div>}}\n|alt1=Upper Darboux sum example\n\n|image2=Riemann Integration and Darboux Lower Sums.gif\n|width2=300\n|caption2=<div class=\"center\" style=\"width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\">Darboux lower sums of the function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup></div>}}\n|alt2=Lower Darboux sum example\n}}\n\n==Formal definitions==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n\n| image1    = Integral Riemann sum.png\n| alt1      = Riemann integral approximation example\n| caption1  = <div class=\"center\" style=\"width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\">Integral example with irregular partitions (largest marked in red)</div>\n\n| image2    = Riemann sum convergence.png\n| alt2      = Riemann sum convergence\n| caption2  = <div class=\"center\" style=\"width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\">Riemann sums converging</div>\n}}\n\nThere are many ways of formally defining an integral, not all of which are equivalent. The differences exist mostly to deal with differing special cases which may not be integrable under other definitions, but also occasionally for pedagogical reasons. The most commonly used definitions of integral are Riemann integrals and Lebesgue integrals.\n\n===Riemann integral===\n{{Main|Riemann integral}}\n\nThe Riemann integral is defined in terms of [[Riemann sum]]s of functions with respect to ''tagged partitions'' of an interval.<ref>{{MathWorld |title=Riemann Sum |id=RiemannSum}}</ref> Let {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} be a [[Interval (mathematics)|closed interval]] of the real line; then a ''tagged partition'' of {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is a finite sequence\n\n:<math> a = x_0 \\le t_1 \\le x_1 \\le t_2 \\le x_2 \\le \\cdots \\le x_{n-1} \\le t_n \\le x_n = b . \\,\\!</math>\n\nThis partitions the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} into {{mvar|n}} sub-intervals {{math|[''x''<sub>''i''\u22121</sub>, ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>]}} indexed by {{mvar|i}}, each of which is \"tagged\" with a distinguished point {{math|''t''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2208 [''x''<sub>''i''\u22121</sub>, ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>]}}. A ''Riemann sum'' of a function {{mvar|f}} with respect to such a tagged partition is defined as\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(t_i) \\Delta_i ; </math>\nthus each term of the sum is the area of a rectangle with height equal to the function value at the distinguished point of the given sub-interval, and width the same as the sub-interval width. Let {{math|\u0394<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>\u2212''x''<sub>''i''\u22121</sub>}} be the width of sub-interval {{mvar|i}}; then the ''mesh'' of such a tagged partition is the width of the largest sub-interval formed by the partition, {{math|max<sub>''i''{{=}}1...''n''</sub> \u0394<sub>''i''</sub>}}. The ''Riemann integral'' of a function {{mvar|f}} over the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is equal to {{mvar|S}} if:\n:For all {{math|''\u03b5'' &gt; 0}} there exists {{math|''\u03b4'' &gt; 0}} such that, for any tagged partition {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} with mesh less than {{mvar|\u03b4}}, we have\n::<math>\\left| S - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(t_i)\\Delta_i \\right| < \\varepsilon.</math>\nWhen the chosen tags give the maximum (respectively, minimum) value of each interval, the Riemann sum becomes an upper (respectively, lower) [[Darboux integral|Darboux sum]], suggesting the close connection between the Riemann integral and the [[Darboux integral]].\n\n===Lebesgue integral===\n{{Main|Lebesgue integration}}\n[[Image:RandLintegrals.svg|thumb|250px|Riemann\u2013Darboux's integration (top) and Lebesgue integration (bottom)|alt=Comparison of Riemann and Lebesgue integrals]]\n\nIt is often of interest, both in theory and applications, to be able to pass to the limit under the integral.  For instance, a sequence of functions can frequently be constructed that approximate, in a suitable sense, the solution to a problem.  Then the integral of the solution function should be the limit of the integrals of the approximations.  However, many functions that can be obtained as limits are not Riemann-integrable, and so such limit theorems do not hold with the Riemann integral.  Therefore, it is of great importance to have a definition of the integral that allows a wider class of functions to be integrated {{Harv|Rudin|1987}}.\n\nSuch an integral is the Lebesgue integral, that exploits the following fact to enlarge the class of integrable functions: if the values of a function are rearranged over the domain, the integral of a function should remain the same.  Thus [[Henri Lebesgue]] introduced the integral bearing his name, explaining this integral thus in a letter to [[Paul Montel]]:\n{{quote|I have to pay a certain sum, which I have collected in my pocket.  I take the bills and coins out of my pocket and give them to the creditor in the order I find them until I have reached the total sum.  This is the Riemann integral.  But I can proceed differently.  After I have taken all the money out of my pocket I order the bills and coins according to identical values and then I pay the several heaps one after the other to the creditor.  This is my integral.|{{harvtxt|Siegmund-Schultze|2008}}}}\n\nAs {{Harvtxt|Folland|1984|loc=p.&nbsp;56}} puts it, \"To compute the Riemann integral of {{mvar|f}}, one partitions the domain {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} into subintervals\", while in the Lebesgue integral, \"one is in effect partitioning the range of {{mvar|f}}\". The definition of the Lebesgue integral thus begins with a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]], \u03bc. In the simplest case, the [[Lebesgue measure]] {{math|''\u03bc''(''A'')}} of an interval {{math|''A'' {{=}} [''a'', ''b'']}} is its width, {{math|''b'' \u2212 ''a''}}, so that the Lebesgue integral agrees with the (proper) Riemann integral when both exist. In more complicated cases, the sets being measured can be highly fragmented, with no continuity and no resemblance to intervals.\n\nUsing the \"partitioning the range of {{mvar|f}}\" philosophy, the integral of a non-negative function {{math|''f'' : '''R''' \u2192 '''R'''}} should be the sum over {{mvar|t}} of the areas between a thin horizontal strip between {{math|1=''y'' = ''t''}} and {{math|1=''y'' = ''t'' + ''dt''}}. This area is just {{math|''\u03bc''{ ''x'' : ''f''(''x'') > ''t''}\u2009''dt''}}.  Let {{math|1=''f''<sup>\u2217</sup>(''t'') = ''\u03bc''{ ''x'' : ''f''(''x'') > ''t''}}}. The Lebesgue integral of {{mvar|f}} is then defined by {{harv|Lieb|Loss|2001}}\n:<math>\\int f = \\int_0^\\infty f^*(t)\\,dt</math>\nwhere the integral on the right is an ordinary improper Riemann integral ({{math|''f''<sup>\u2217</sup>}} is a strictly decreasing positive function, and therefore has a [[well-defined]] improper Riemann integral).  For a suitable class of functions (the [[measurable function]]s) this defines the Lebesgue integral.\n\nA general measurable function {{mvar|f}} is Lebesgue-integrable if the area between the graph of {{mvar|f}} and the {{mvar|x}}-axis is finite:\n:<math>\\int_E |f|\\,d\\mu < + \\infty.</math>\nIn that case, the integral is, as in the Riemannian case, the difference between the area above the {{mvar|x}}-axis and the area below the {{mvar|x}}-axis:\n:<math>\\int_E f \\,d\\mu = \\int_E f^+ \\,d\\mu - \\int_E f^- \\,d\\mu</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n f^+(x)&=\\max(\\{f(x),0\\}) &=&\\begin{cases}\n               f(x), & \\text{if } f(x) > 0, \\\\\n               0, & \\text{otherwise,}\n             \\end{cases}\\\\\n f^-(x) &=\\max(\\{-f(x),0\\})&=& \\begin{cases}\n               -f(x), & \\text{if } f(x) < 0, \\\\\n               0, & \\text{otherwise.}\n             \\end{cases}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===Other integrals===\nAlthough the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals are the most widely used definitions of the integral, a number of others exist, including:\n* The [[Darboux integral]], which is constructed using Darboux sums and is equivalent to a [[Riemann integral]], meaning that a function is Darboux-integrable if and only if it is Riemann-integrable. Darboux integrals have the advantage of being simpler to define than Riemann integrals.\n* The [[Riemann\u2013Stieltjes integral]], an extension of the Riemann integral.\n* The [[Lebesgue\u2013Stieltjes integration|Lebesgue\u2013Stieltjes integral]], further developed by [[Johann Radon]], which generalizes the [[Riemann\u2013Stieltjes integral|Riemann\u2013Stieltjes]] and [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integrals]].\n* The [[Daniell integral]], which subsumes the [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integral]] and [[Lebesgue\u2013Stieltjes integration|Lebesgue\u2013Stieltjes integral]] without the dependence on [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]s.\n* The [[Haar integral]], used for integration on locally compact topological groups, introduced by [[Alfr\u00e9d Haar]] in 1933.\n* The [[Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integral]], variously defined by [[Arnaud Denjoy]], [[Oskar Perron]], and (most elegantly, as the gauge integral) [[Jaroslav Kurzweil]], and developed by [[Ralph Henstock]].\n* The [[It\u014d calculus|It\u014d integral]] and [[Stratonovich integral]], which define integration with respect to [[semimartingale]]s such as [[Wiener process|Brownian motion]].\n<!--* The [[Darboux integral]], equivalent to the Riemann integral.-->\n<!--* The [[Haar integral]], which is the Lebesgue integral with [[Haar measure]].-->\n* The [[Young integral]], which is a kind of Riemann\u2013Stieltjes integral with respect to certain functions of [[Bounded variation|unbounded variation]].\n* The [[rough path]] integral, which is defined for functions equipped with some additional \"rough path\" structure and generalizes stochastic integration against both [[semimartingale]]s and processes such as the [[fractional Brownian motion]].\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Linearity===\nThe collection of Riemann-integrable functions on a closed interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} forms a [[vector space]] under the operations of [[pointwise addition]] and multiplication by a scalar, and the operation of integration\n:<math> f \\mapsto \\int_a^b f(x) \\; dx</math>\n<!--- redundant\nfor an integrable [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{mvar|f}} on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}\n--->\nis a [[linear functional]] on this vector space. Thus, firstly, the collection of integrable functions is closed under taking [[linear combination]]s; and, secondly, the integral of a linear combination is the linear combination of the integrals,\n\n<!--- leftover from the past text; redundant\nFor example, in Riemann integration, if {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are [[real number|real-valued]] integrable functions on a [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]] [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, and {{mvar|\u03b1}} and {{mvar|\u03b2}} are real numbers, then the function {{math|''\u03b1f'' + ''\u03b2g''}} defined by {{math|(''\u03b1f'' + ''\u03b2g'')(''x'') {{=}} ''\u03b1f''(''x'') + ''\u03b2g''(''x'')}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is integrable, with\n--->\n:<math> \\int_a^b (\\alpha f + \\beta g)(x) \\, dx = \\alpha \\int_a^b f(x) \\,dx + \\beta \\int_a^b g(x) \\, dx. \\,</math>\n\nSimilarly, the set of [[real number|real]]-valued Lebesgue-integrable functions on a given [[Measure (mathematics)|measure space]] {{mvar|E}} with measure {{mvar|\u03bc}} is closed under taking linear combinations and hence form a vector space, and the Lebesgue integral\n\n: <math> f\\mapsto \\int_E f \\, d\\mu </math>\n\nis a linear functional on this vector space, so that\n\n:<math> \\int_E (\\alpha f + \\beta g) \\, d\\mu = \\alpha \\int_E f \\, d\\mu + \\beta \\int_E g \\, d\\mu. </math>\n\nMore generally, consider the vector space of all [[measurable function]]s on a measure space {{math|(''E'',''\u03bc'')}}, taking values in a [[Locally compact space|locally compact]] [[complete metric space|complete]] [[topological vector space]] {{mvar|V}} over a locally compact [[Topological ring|topological field]] {{math|''K'',  ''f'' : ''E'' \u2192 ''V''}}. Then one may define an abstract integration map assigning to each function {{mvar|f}} an element of {{mvar|V}} or the symbol {{math|''\u221e''}},\n:<math> f\\mapsto\\int_E f \\,d\\mu, \\,</math>\nthat is compatible with linear combinations. In this situation the linearity holds for the subspace of functions whose integral is an element of {{mvar|V}} (i.e. \"finite\"). The most important special cases arise when {{mvar|K}} is {{math|'''R'''}}, {{math|'''C'''}}, or a finite extension of the field {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} of [[p-adic number]]s, and {{mvar|V}} is a finite-dimensional vector space over {{mvar|K}}, and when {{math|''K'' {{=}} '''C'''}} and {{mvar|V}} is a complex [[Hilbert space]].\n\nLinearity, together with some natural continuity properties and normalisation for a certain class of \"simple\" functions, may be used to give an alternative definition of the integral. This is the approach of [[Daniell integral|Daniell]] for the case of real-valued functions on a set {{mvar|X}}, generalized by [[Nicolas Bourbaki]] to functions with values in a locally compact topological vector space. See {{Harv|Hildebrandt|1953}} for an axiomatic characterisation of the integral.\n\n===Inequalities===\nA number of general inequalities hold for Riemann-integrable [[function (mathematics)|functions]] defined on a [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]] [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} and can be generalized to other notions of integral (Lebesgue and Daniell).\n\n* ''Upper and lower bounds.'' An integrable function {{mvar|f}} on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, is necessarily [[bounded function|bounded]] on that interval. Thus there are [[real number]]s {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|M}} so that {{math|''m'' \u2264 ''f''\u2009(''x'') \u2264 ''M''}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}. Since the lower and upper sums of {{mvar|f}} over {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} are therefore bounded by, respectively, {{math|''m''(''b'' \u2212 ''a'')}} and {{math|''M''(''b'' \u2212 ''a'')}}, it follows that\n:: <math> m(b - a) \\leq \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx \\leq M(b - a). </math>\n\n* ''Inequalities between functions.'' If {{math|''f''(''x'') \u2264 ''g''(''x'')}} for each {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} then each of the upper and lower sums of {{mvar|f}} is bounded above by the upper and lower sums, respectively, of {{mvar|g}}. Thus\n:: <math> \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx \\leq \\int_a^b g(x) \\, dx. </math>\n:This is a generalization of the above inequalities, as {{math|''M''(''b'' \u2212 ''a'')}} is the integral of the constant function with value {{mvar|M}} over {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}.\n:In addition, if the inequality between functions is strict, then the inequality between integrals is also strict. That is, if {{math|''f''(''x'') < ''g''(''x'')}} for each {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, then\n:: <math> \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx < \\int_a^b g(x) \\, dx. </math>\n\n* ''Subintervals.'' If {{math|[''c'', ''d'']}} is a subinterval of {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} and {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is non-negative for all {{mvar|x}}, then\n:: <math> \\int_c^d f(x) \\, dx \\leq \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx. </math>\n\n* ''Products and absolute values of functions.'' If {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are two functions then we may consider their [[pointwise product]]s and powers, and [[absolute value]]s:\n:: <math>\n (fg)(x)= f(x) g(x), \\; f^2 (x) = (f(x))^2, \\; |f| (x) = |f(x)|.\\,</math>\n:If {{mvar|f}} is Riemann-integrable on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} then the same is true for {{math|{{abs|''f''}}}}, and\n:: <math>\\left| \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx \\right| \\leq \\int_a^b | f(x) | \\, dx. </math>\n:Moreover, if {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are both Riemann-integrable then {{math|''fg''}} is also Riemann-integrable, and\n:: <math>\\left( \\int_a^b (fg)(x) \\, dx \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\int_a^b f(x)^2 \\, dx \\right) \\left( \\int_a^b g(x)^2 \\, dx \\right). </math>\n:This inequality, known as the [[Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality]], plays a prominent role in [[Hilbert space]] theory, where the left hand side is interpreted as the [[Inner product space|inner product]] of two [[Square-integrable function|square-integrable]] functions {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} on the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}.\n\n* ''H\u00f6lder's inequality.'' Suppose that {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} are two real numbers, {{math|1 \u2264 ''p'', ''q'' \u2264 \u221e}} with {{math|{{sfrac|1|''p''}} + {{sfrac|1|''q''}} {{=}} 1}}, and  {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are two Riemann-integrable functions. Then the functions  {{math|{{abs|''f''}}<sup>''p''</sup>}} and {{math|{{abs|''g''}}<sup>''q''</sup>}} are also integrable and the following [[H\u00f6lder's inequality]] holds:\n:<math>\\left|\\int f(x)g(x)\\,dx\\right| \\leq\n\\left(\\int \\left|f(x)\\right|^p\\,dx \\right)^{1/p} \\left(\\int\\left|g(x)\\right|^q\\,dx\\right)^{1/q}.</math>\n:For {{mvar|p}} = {{mvar|q}} = 2, H\u00f6lder's inequality becomes the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality.\n\n* ''Minkowski inequality''. Suppose that {{math|''p'' \u2265 1}} is a real number and {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are Riemann-integrable functions. Then {{math|{{abs| ''f'' }}<sup>''p''</sup>, {{abs| ''g'' }}<sup>''p''</sup>}} and {{math|{{abs| ''f'' + ''g'' }}<sup>''p''</sup>}} are also Riemann-integrable and the following [[Minkowski inequality]] holds:\n:<math>\\left(\\int \\left|f(x)+g(x)\\right|^p\\,dx \\right)^{1/p} \\leq\n\\left(\\int \\left|f(x)\\right|^p\\,dx \\right)^{1/p} +\n\\left(\\int \\left|g(x)\\right|^p\\,dx \\right)^{1/p}.</math>\n: An analogue of this inequality for Lebesgue integral is used in construction of [[Lp space|L<sup>p</sup> spaces]].\n\n===Conventions===\nIn this section {{mvar|f}} is a [[real number|real-]]valued Riemann-integrable [[function (mathematics)|function]]. The integral\n:<math> \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx </math>\nover an interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is defined if {{math|''a'' &lt; ''b''}}. This means that the upper and lower sums of the function {{mvar|f}} are evaluated on a partition {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''x''<sub>0</sub> \u2264 ''x''<sub>1</sub> \u2264 . . . \u2264 ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> {{=}} ''b''}} whose values {{math|''x''<sub>''i''</sub>}} are increasing. Geometrically, this signifies that integration takes place \"left to right\", evaluating {{mvar|f}} within intervals {{math|[''x''<sub>\u2009''i''</sub>\u2009, ''x''<sub>\u2009''i''\u2009+1</sub>]}} where an interval with a higher index lies to the right of one with a lower index. The values {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, the end-points of the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], are called the [[limits of integration]] of {{mvar|f}}. Integrals can also be defined if {{math|''a'' &gt; ''b''}}:\n\n* ''Reversing limits of integration.'' If {{math|''a'' &gt; ''b''}} then define\n:: <math>\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = - \\int_b^a f(x) \\, dx. </math>\nThis, with {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''b''}}, implies:\n* ''Integrals over intervals of length zero.'' If {{mvar|a}} is a [[real number]] then\n:: <math>\\int_a^a f(x) \\, dx = 0. </math>\n\nThe first convention is necessary in consideration of taking integrals over subintervals of {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}; the second says that an integral taken over a degenerate interval, or a [[Point (geometry)|point]], should be [[0 (number)|zero]]. One reason for the first convention is that the integrability of {{mvar|f}} on an interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} implies that {{mvar|f}} is integrable on any subinterval {{math|[''c'', ''d'']}}, but in particular integrals have the property that:\n\n* ''Additivity of integration on intervals.'' If {{mvar|c}} is any [[element (mathematics)|element]] of {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, then\n:: <math> \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = \\int_a^c f(x) \\, dx + \\int_c^b f(x) \\, dx.</math>\nWith the first convention, the resulting relation\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n \\int_a^c f(x) \\, dx &{}= \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx - \\int_c^b f(x) \\, dx \\\\\n &{} = \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx + \\int_b^c f(x) \\, dx\n\\end{align}</math>\nis then well-defined for any cyclic permutation of {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}}.\n\n==Fundamental theorem of calculus==\n{{Main|Fundamental theorem of calculus}}\n\nThe ''fundamental theorem of calculus'' is the statement that [[derivative|differentiation]] and integration are inverse operations: if a [[continuous function]] is first integrated and then differentiated, the original function is retrieved. An important consequence, sometimes called the ''second fundamental theorem of calculus'', allows one to compute integrals by using an antiderivative of the function to be integrated.\n\n===Statements of theorems===\n\n====Fundamental theorem of calculus====\n\nLet {{mvar|f}} be a continuous real-valued function defined on a [[Interval (mathematics)#Terminology|closed interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}. Let {{mvar|F}} be the function defined, for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, by\n:<math>F(x) = \\int_a^x f(t)\\, dt.</math>\nThen, {{mvar|F}} is continuous on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, differentiable on the open interval {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}}, and\n\n:<math>F'(x) = f(x)</math>\n\nfor all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}}.\n\n====Second fundamental theorem of calculus====\n\nLet {{mvar|f}} be a real-valued function defined on a [[closed interval]] {{mvar|[''a'', ''b'']}} that admits an [[antiderivative]] {{mvar|F}} on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}. That is, {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|F}} are functions such that for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}},\n\n:<math>f(x) = F'(x).</math>\n\nIf {{mvar|f}} is integrable on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} then\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx = F(b) - F(a).</math>\n\n===Calculating integrals===\nThe second fundamental theorem allows many integrals to be calculated explicitly.  For example, to calculate the integral\n:<math>\\int_0^1x^{1/2}\\,dx,</math>\nof the square root function {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>1/2</sup>}} between 0 and 1, it is sufficient to find an antiderivative, that is, a function {{math|''F''(''x'')}} whose derivative equals  {{math|''f''(''x'')}}:\n:<math>F'(x)=f(x).</math>\nOne such function is {{math|''F''(''x'') {{=}} {{sfrac|2|3}}''x''<sup>3/2</sup>}}.  Then the value of the integral in question is\n:<math>\\int_0^1x^{1/2}\\,dx = F(1) - F(0) = \\frac{2}{3} (1)^{3/2} - \\frac{2}{3} (0)^{3/2}=\\frac{2}{3}.</math>\n\nThis is a case of a general rule, that for {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>''q''</sup>}}, with {{math|''q'' \u2260 \u22121}}, the related function, the so-called antiderivative is {{math|''F''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>''q'' + 1</sup>/(''q'' + 1).}}  Tables of this and similar antiderivatives can be used to calculate integrals explicitly, in much the same way that tables of derivatives can be used.\n\n==Extensions==\n\n===Improper integrals===\n{{Main|Improper integral}}\n[[File:Improper integral.svg|right|thumb|The [[improper integral]]<br/><math>\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{dx}{(x+1)\\sqrt{x}} = \\pi</math><br/> has unbounded intervals for both domain and range.]]\nA \"proper\" Riemann integral assumes the integrand is defined and finite on a closed and bounded interval, bracketed by the limits of integration. An improper integral occurs when one or more of these conditions is not satisfied. In some cases such integrals may be defined by considering the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of a [[sequence]] of proper [[Riemann integral]]s on progressively larger intervals.\n\nIf the interval is unbounded, for instance at its upper end, then the improper integral is the limit as that endpoint goes to infinity.\n:<math>\\int_{a}^{\\infty} f(x)\\,dx = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\\,dx</math>\nIf the integrand is only defined or finite on a half-open interval, for instance {{math|<nowiki>(</nowiki>''a'', ''b''<nowiki>]</nowiki>}}, then again a limit may provide a finite result.\n:<math>\\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\\,dx = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\int_{a+\\epsilon}^{b} f(x)\\,dx</math>\n\nThat is, the improper integral is the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of proper integrals as one endpoint of the interval of integration approaches either a specified [[real number]], or {{math|\u221e}}, or {{math|\u2212\u221e}}. In more complicated cases, limits are required at both endpoints, or at interior points.\n\n===Multiple integration===\n{{Main|Multiple integral}}\n[[File:Volume under surface.png|right|thumb|Double integral as volume under a surface.]]\nJust as the definite integral of a positive function of one variable represents the [[area]] of the region between the graph of the function and the ''x''-axis, the ''double integral'' of a positive function of two variables represents the [[volume]] of the region between the surface defined by the function and the plane which contains its [[domain (mathematics)|domain]]. For example, a function in two dimensions depends on two real variables, ''x'' and ''y'', and the integral of a function ''f'' over the rectangle ''R'' given as the [[Cartesian product]] of two intervals <math>R=[a,b]\\times [c,d]</math> can be written\n\n:<math>\\int_R f(x,y)\\,dA</math>\n\nwhere the differential {{math|''dA''}} indicates that integration is taken with respect to area.  This [[double integral]] can be defined using [[Riemann sum]]s, and represents the (signed) volume under the graph of {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'',''y'')}} over the domain ''R''.  Under suitable conditions (e.g., if ''f'' is continuous), then [[Fubini's theorem]] guarantees that this integral can be expressed as an equivalent iterated integral\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b\\left[\\int_c^d f(x,y)\\,dy\\right]\\,dx.</math>\n\nThis reduces the problem of computing a double integral to computing one-dimensional integrals.  Because of this, another notation for the integral over ''R'' uses a double integral sign:\n:<math>\\iint_R f(x,y) dA.</math>\n\nIntegration over more general domains is possible.  The integral of a function ''f'', with respect to volume, over a subset ''D'' of  \u211d<sup>n</sup> is denoted by notation such as\n\n:<math>\\int_D f(\\mathbf x)d^n\\mathbf x,\\quad \\int_D f\\,dV</math>\n\nor similar.  See [[volume integral]].\n\n===Line integrals===\n{{Main|Line integral}}\n[[File:Line-Integral.gif|right|thumb|A line integral sums together elements along a curve.]]\nThe concept of an integral can be extended to more general domains of integration, such as curved lines and surfaces. Such integrals are known as line integrals and surface integrals respectively. These have important applications in physics, as when dealing with [[vector field]]s.\n\nA ''line integral'' (sometimes called a ''path integral'') is an integral where the [[function (mathematics)|function]] to be integrated is evaluated along a [[curve]]. Various different line integrals are in use. In the case of a closed curve it is also called a ''contour integral''.\n\nThe function to be integrated may be a [[scalar field]] or a [[vector field]]. The value of the line integral is the sum of values of the field at all points on the curve, weighted by some scalar function on the curve (commonly [[arc length]] or, for a vector field, the [[Inner product space|scalar product]] of the vector field with a [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] vector in the curve). This weighting distinguishes the line integral from simpler integrals defined on [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]s. Many simple formulas in physics have natural continuous analogs in terms of line integrals; for example, the fact that [[Mechanical work|work]] is equal to [[force]], {{math|'''F'''}}, multiplied by displacement, {{math|'''s'''}}, may be expressed (in terms of vector quantities) as:\n:<math>W=\\mathbf F\\cdot\\mathbf s.</math>\nFor an object moving along a path {{mvar|''C''}} in a [[vector field]] {{math|'''F'''}} such as an [[electric field]] or [[gravitational field]], the total work done by the field on the object is obtained by summing up the differential work done in moving from {{math|'''s'''}} to {{math|'''s''' + ''d'''''s'''}}. This gives the line integral\n:<math>W=\\int_C \\mathbf F\\cdot d\\mathbf s.</math>\n\n===Surface integrals===\n{{Main|Surface integral}}\n[[File:Surface integral illustration.svg|right|thumb|The definition of surface integral relies on splitting the surface into small surface elements.]]\nA ''surface integral'' is a definite integral taken over a [[surface]] (which may be a curved set in [[space]]); it can be thought of as the [[Multiple integral|double integral]] analog of the [[line integral]]. The function to be integrated may be a [[scalar field]] or a [[vector field]]. The value of the surface integral is the sum of the field at all points on the surface. This can be achieved by splitting the surface into surface elements, which provide the partitioning for Riemann sums.\n\nFor an example of applications of surface integrals, consider a vector field {{math|'''v'''}} on a surface {{math|''S''}}; that is, for each point {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''S''}}, {{math|'''v'''(''x'')}} is a vector. Imagine that we have a fluid flowing through {{math|''S''}}, such that {{math|'''v'''(''x'')}} determines the velocity of the fluid at {{mvar|x}}. The [[flux]] is defined as the quantity of fluid flowing through {{math|''S''}} in unit amount of time. To find the flux, we need to take the [[dot product]] of {{math|'''v'''}} with the unit [[Normal (geometry)|surface normal]] to {{math|''S''}} at each point, which will give us a scalar field, which we integrate over the surface:\n:<math>\\int_S {\\mathbf v}\\cdot \\,d{\\mathbf {S}}.</math>\nThe fluid flux in this example may be from a physical fluid such as water or air, or from electrical or magnetic flux. Thus surface integrals have applications in [[physics]], particularly with the [[classical theory]] of [[electromagnetism]].\n\n===Contour integrals===\n\nIn [[complex analysis]], the integrand is a [[complex-valued function]] of a complex variable {{mvar|z}} instead of a real function of a real variable {{mvar|x}}. When a complex function is integrated along a curve <math>\\gamma</math> in the complex plane, the integral is denoted as follows\n\n:<math>\\int_{\\gamma} f(z)\\,dz</math>.\n\nThis is known as a [[contour integral]].\n\n===Integrals of differential forms===\n{{Main|differential form}}\nA [[differential form]] is a mathematical concept in the fields of [[multivariable calculus]], [[differential topology]], and [[tensor]]s.  Differential forms are organized by degree.  For example, a one-form is a weighted sum of the differentials of the coordinates, such as:\n:<math>E(x,y,z)\\,dx + F(x,y,z)\\,dy + G(x,y,z)\\, dz</math>\nwhere ''E'', ''F'', ''G'' are functions in three dimensions.  A differential one-form can be integrated over an oriented path, and the resulting integral is just another way of writing a line integral. Here the basic differentials ''dx'', ''dy'', ''dz'' measure infinitesimal oriented lengths parallel to the three coordinate axes.\n\nA differential two-form is a sum of the form\n:<math>G(x,y,z)dx\\wedge dy + E(x,y,z)dy\\wedge dz + F(x,y,z)dz\\wedge dx.</math>\nHere the basic two-forms <math>dx\\wedge dy, dz\\wedge dx, dy\\wedge dz</math> measure oriented areas parallel to the coordinate two-planes.  The symbol <math>\\wedge</math> denotes the [[wedge product]], which is similar to the [[cross product]] in the sense that the wedge product of two forms representing oriented lengths represents an oriented area.  A two-form can be integrated over an oriented surface, and the resulting integral is equivalent to the surface integral giving the flux of <math>E\\mathbf i+F\\mathbf j+G\\mathbf k</math>.\n\nUnlike the cross product, and the three-dimensional vector calculus, the wedge product and the calculus of differential forms makes sense in arbitrary dimension and on more general manifolds (curves, surfaces, and their higher-dimensional analogs).  The [[exterior derivative]] plays the role of the [[gradient]] and [[curl]] of vector calculus, and [[Stokes' theorem]] simultaneously generalizes the three theorems of vector calculus: the [[divergence theorem]], [[Green's theorem]], and the [[Kelvin-Stokes theorem]].\n\n===Summations===\nThe discrete equivalent of integration is [[summation]]. Summations and integrals can be put on the same foundations using the theory of [[Lebesgue integral]]s or [[time scale calculus]].\n\n==Computation==\n\n===Analytical===\nThe most basic technique for computing definite integrals of one real variable is based on the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]. Let {{math|''f''(''x'')}} be the function of {{mvar|x}} to be integrated over a given interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}. Then, find an antiderivative of {{mvar|f}}; that is, a function {{mvar|F}} such that {{math|''F''\u2032 {{=}} ''f''}} on the interval. Provided the integrand and integral have no [[Mathematical singularity|singularities]] on the path of integration, by the fundamental theorem of calculus,\n\n:<math>\\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx=F(b)-F(a).</math>\n\nThe integral is not actually the antiderivative, but the fundamental theorem provides a way to use antiderivatives to evaluate definite integrals.\n\nThe most difficult step is usually to find the antiderivative of {{mvar|f}}. It is rarely possible to glance at a function and write down its antiderivative. More often, it is necessary to use one of the many techniques that have been developed to evaluate integrals. Most of these techniques rewrite one integral as a different one which is hopefully more tractable. Techniques include:\n* [[Integration by substitution]]\n* [[Integration by parts]]\n* [[Inverse function integration]]\n* [[Order of integration (calculus)|Changing the order of integration]]\n* [[trigonometric substitution|Integration by trigonometric substitution]]\n* [[Tangent half-angle substitution]]\n* [[Partial fractions in integration|Integration by partial fractions]]\n* [[Integration by reduction formulae]]\n* [[Integration using parametric derivatives]]\n* [[Integration using Euler's formula]]\n* [[Euler substitution]]\n* [[Differentiation under the integral sign]]\n* [[Methods of contour integration|Contour integration]]\nAlternative methods exist to compute more complex integrals. Many [[nonelementary integral]]s can be expanded in a [[Taylor series]] and integrated term by term. Occasionally, the resulting infinite series can be summed analytically.  The method of convolution using [[Meijer G-function]]s can also be used, assuming that the integrand can be written as a product of Meijer G-functions. There are also many less common ways of calculating definite integrals; for instance, [[Parseval's identity]] can be used to transform an integral over a rectangular region into an infinite sum. Occasionally, an integral can be evaluated by a trick; for an example of this, see [[Gaussian integral]].\n\nComputations of volumes of [[solid of revolution|solids of revolution]] can usually be done with [[disk integration]] or [[shell integration]].\n\nSpecific results which have been worked out by various techniques are collected in the [[Lists of integrals|list of integrals]].\n\n===Symbolic===\n{{Main|Symbolic integration}}\n\nMany problems in mathematics, physics, and engineering involve integration where an explicit formula for the integral is desired. Extensive [[Lists of integrals|tables of integrals]] have been compiled and published over the years for this purpose. With the spread of [[computer]]s, many professionals, educators, and students have turned to [[computer algebra system]]s that are specifically designed to perform difficult or tedious tasks, including integration. Symbolic integration has been one of the motivations for the development of the first such systems, like [[Macsyma]].\n\nA major mathematical difficulty in symbolic integration is that in many cases, a closed formula for the antiderivative of a rather simple-looking function does not exist. For instance, it is known that the antiderivatives of the functions {{math|exp(''x''<sup>2</sup>), ''x''<sup>''x''</sup>}} and {{math|(sin ''x'')/''x''}} cannot be expressed in the closed form involving only [[rational function|rational]] and [[exponential function|exponential]] functions, [[logarithm]], [[trigonometric function|trigonometric]] and [[inverse trigonometric function]]s, and the operations of multiplication and composition; in other words, none of the three given functions is integrable in [[elementary function]]s, which are the functions which may be built from  rational functions, [[Root of a function|roots of a polynomial]], logarithm, and exponential functions. The [[Risch algorithm]] provides a general criterion to determine whether the antiderivative of an elementary function is elementary, and, if it is, to compute it. Unfortunately, it turns out that functions with closed expressions of antiderivatives are the exception rather than the rule. Consequently, computerized algebra systems have no hope of being able to find an antiderivative for a randomly constructed elementary function. On the positive side, if the 'building blocks' for antiderivatives are fixed in advance, it may be still be possible to decide whether the antiderivative of a given function can be expressed using these blocks and operations of multiplication and composition, and to find the symbolic answer whenever it exists. The [[Risch algorithm]], implemented in [[Mathematica]] and other [[computer algebra system]]s, does just that for functions and antiderivatives built from  rational functions, [[Nth root|radicals]], logarithm, and exponential functions.\n\nSome special integrands occur often enough to warrant special study. In particular, it may be useful to have, in the set of antiderivatives, the [[special functions]] of [[physics]] (like the [[Associated Legendre function|Legendre functions]], the [[hypergeometric function]], the [[Gamma function]], the [[Incomplete Gamma function]] and so on&nbsp;\u2014 see [[Symbolic integration]] for more details). Extending the Risch's algorithm to include such functions is possible but challenging and has been an active research subject.\n\nMore recently a new approach has emerged, using [[D-finite function|''D''-finite functions]], which are the solutions of [[linear differential equation]]s with polynomial coefficients. Most of the elementary and special functions are ''D''-finite, and the integral of a ''D''-finite function is also a ''D''-finite function. This provides an algorithm to express the antiderivative of a ''D''-finite function as the solution of a differential equation.\n\nThis theory also allows one to compute the definite integral of a ''D''-function as the sum of a series given by the first coefficients, and provides an algorithm to compute any coefficient.<ref>[http://algo.inria.fr/chyzak/mgfun.html Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chyzak's Mgfun Project: Introduction to the Package Mgfun and Related Packages]</ref>\n\n===Numerical===\n{{Main|Numerical integration}}\n\nSome integrals found in real applications can be computed by closed-form antiderivatives.  Others are not so accommodating.  Some antiderivatives do not have closed forms, some closed forms require special functions which themselves are a challenge to compute, and others are so complex that finding the exact answer is too slow. This motivates the study and application of numerical approximations of integrals. This subject, called ''numerical integration'' or ''numerical quadrature'', arose early in the study of integration for the purpose of making hand calculations. The development of general-purpose computers made numerical integration more practical and drove a desire for improvements.  The goals of numerical integration are accuracy, reliability, efficiency, and generality, and sophisticated modern methods can vastly outperform a naive method by all four measures ({{Harvnb|Dahlquist|Bj\u00f6rck|2008}}; {{Harvnb|Kahaner|Moler|Nash|1989}}; {{Harvnb|Stoer|Bulirsch|2002}}).\n\nConsider, for example, the integral\n:<math> \\int_{-2}^{2} \\tfrac{1}{5} \\left( \\tfrac{1}{100}(322 + 3 x (98 + x (37 + x))) - 24 \\frac{x}{1+x^2} \\right) dx  </math>\nwhich has the exact answer {{nowrap|94/25 {{=}} 3.76}}. (In ordinary practice the answer is not known in advance, so an important task&nbsp;\u2014 not explored here&nbsp;\u2014 is to decide when an approximation is good enough.) A \u201ccalculus book\u201d approach divides the integration range into, say, 16 equal pieces, and computes function values.\n:{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;background-color:white\"\n|+ Spaced function values\n|-\n!

The accuracy is not impressive, but calculus formally uses pieces of infinitesimal width, so initially this may seem little cause for concern. Indeed, repeatedly doubling the number of steps eventually produces an approximation of 3.76001. However, 2<sup>18</sup> pieces are required, a great computational expense for such little accuracy; and a reach for greater accuracy can force steps so small that arithmetic precision becomes an obstacle.\n\nA better approach replaces the rectangles used in a Riemann sum with trapezoids. The [[trapezoid rule]] is almost as easy to calculate; it sums all 17 function values, but weights the first and last by one half, and again multiplies by the step width. This immediately improves the approximation to 3.76925, which is noticeably more accurate. Furthermore, only 2<sup>10</sup> pieces are needed to achieve 3.76000, substantially less computation than the rectangle method for comparable accuracy. The idea behind the trapezoid rule, that more accurate approximations to the function yield better approximations to the integral, can be carried further.  [[Simpson's rule]] approximates the integrand by a piecewise quadratic function.  Riemann sums, the trapezoid rule, and Simpson's rule are examples of a family of quadrature rules called [[Newton\u2013Cotes formulas]].  The degree {{math|''n''}} Newton\u2013Cotes quadrature rule approximates the polynomial on each subinterval by a degree {{math|''n''}} polynomial.  This polynomial is chosen to interpolate the values of the function on the interval.  Higher degree Newton-Cotes approximations can be more accurate, but they require more function evaluations (already Simpson's rule requires twice the function evaluations of the trapezoid rule), and they can suffer from numerical inaccuracy due to [[Runge's phenomenon]].  One solution to this problem is [[Clenshaw\u2013Curtis quadrature]].  In Clenshaw\u2013Curtis quadrature, the integrand is approximated by expanding it in terms of [[Chebyshev polynomials]].  This produces an approximation whose values never deviate far from those of the original function.\n\n[[Romberg's method]] builds on the trapezoid method to great effect. First, the step lengths are halved incrementally, giving trapezoid approximations denoted by {{math|''T''(''h''<sub>0</sub>), ''T''(''h''<sub>1</sub>)}}, and so on, where {{math|''h''<sub>''k''+1</sub>}} is half of {{math|''h''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. For each new step size, only half the new function values need to be computed; the others carry over from the previous size (as shown in the table above). But the really powerful idea is to [[Interpolation|interpolate]] a polynomial through the approximations, and extrapolate to {{math|''T''(0)}}. With this method a numerically ''exact'' answer here requires only four pieces (five function values). The [[Lagrange polynomial]] interpolating {{math|{''h''<sub>''k''</sub>,''T''(''h''<sub>''k''</sub>)}<sub>''k'' {{=}} 0...2</sub> {{=}}}} {(4.00,6.128), (2.00,4.352), (1.00,3.908)} is 3.76 + 0.148{{math|''h''<sup>2</sup>}}, producing the extrapolated value 3.76 at {{math|''h'' {{=}} 0}}.\n\n[[Gaussian quadrature]] often requires noticeably less work for superior accuracy. In this example, it can compute the function values at just two {{mvar|x}} positions, {{math|\u00b12 \u2044 {{sqrt|3}}}}, then double each value and sum to get the numerically exact answer. The explanation for this dramatic success lies in the choice of points. Unlike Newton\u2013Cotes rules, which interpolate the integrand at evenly spaced points, Gaussian quadrature evaluates the function at the roots of a set of [[orthogonal polynomial]]s.  An {{mvar|n}}-point Gaussian method is exact for polynomials of degree up to {{math|2''n'' \u2212 1}}. The function in this example is a degree 3 polynomial, plus a term that cancels because the chosen endpoints are symmetric around zero. (Cancellation also benefits the Romberg method.)\n\nIn practice, each method must use extra evaluations to ensure an error bound on an unknown function; this tends to offset some of the advantage of the pure Gaussian method, and motivates the popular [[Gauss\u2013Kronrod quadrature formula]]e. More broadly, [[adaptive quadrature]] partitions a range into pieces based on function properties, so that data points are concentrated where they are needed most.\n\nThe computation of higher-dimensional integrals (for example, volume calculations) makes important use of such alternatives as [[Monte Carlo integration]].\n\nA calculus text is no substitute for numerical analysis, but the reverse is also true. Even the best adaptive numerical code sometimes requires a user to help with the more demanding integrals. For example, improper integrals may require a change of variable or methods that can avoid infinite function values, and known properties like symmetry and periodicity may provide critical leverage.  For example, the integral <math>\\int_0^1 x^{-1/2} e^{-x}\\,dx</math> is difficult to evaluate numerically because it is infinite at {{math|1=''x'' = 0}}.  However, the substitution {{math|1=''u'' = \u221a''x''}} transforms the integral into <math>\\int_0^1 e^{-u^2}\\,du</math>, which has no singularities at all.\n\n===Mechanical===\nThe area of an arbitrary two-dimensional shape can be determined using a measuring instrument called [[planimeter]].
