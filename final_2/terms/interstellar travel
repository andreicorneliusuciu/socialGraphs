Interstellar travel will be much more difficult than [[interplanetary spaceflight]]; the distances between the [[planet]]s in the [[Solar System]] are less than 30 [[astronomical unit]]s (AU)\u2014whereas the distances between stars are typically hundreds of thousands of AU, and usually expressed in [[light-year]]s. Because of the vastness of those distances, interstellar travel would require a high percentage of the [[speed of light]], or huge travel time, lasting from decades to millennia or longer.\n\nThe speeds required for interstellar travel in a human lifetime far exceed what current methods of [[spacecraft propulsion]] can provide. Even with a hypothetically perfectly efficient propulsion system, the [[kinetic energy]] corresponding to those speeds is enormous by today's standards of [[energy development|energy production]].  Moreover, collisions by the spacecraft with [[cosmic dust]] and gas can produce very dangerous effects both to passengers and the spacecraft itself.\n\nA number of strategies have been proposed to deal with these problems, ranging from giant arks that would carry entire societies and ecosystems, to microscopic [[space probe]]s. Many different [[spacecraft propulsion]] systems have been proposed to give spacecraft the required speeds, including [[nuclear propulsion]], [[beam-powered propulsion]], and methods based on speculative physics.\n\nFor both piloted and unpiloted interstellar travel, considerable technological and economic challenges need to be met. Even the most optimistic views about interstellar travel see it as only being feasible decades from now\u2014the more common view is that it is a century or more away. However, in spite of the challenges, if interstellar travel should ever be realized, then a wide range of scientific benefits can be expected.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=I.

Such a system could grow organically if [[space-based solar power]] became a significant component of Earth's energy mix.  Consumer demand for a multi-terawatt system would automatically create the necessary multi-million metric ton/year logistical system.<ref>Conclusion of the 2016 Tennessee Valley Interstellar Workshop Space Solar Power Working Track run by Peter Garretson & Robert Kennedy.</ref>\n\n== Challenges ==\n\n=== Interstellar distances ===\nDistances between the planets in the Solar System are often measured in [[astronomical unit]]s (AU), defined as the average distance between the Sun and Earth, some 1.5\u00d710<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;kilometers (93 million miles). [[Venus]], the closest other planet to Earth is (at closest approach) 0.28 AU away. [[Neptune]], the farthest planet from the Sun, is 29.8 AU away. [[Voyager&nbsp;1]], the farthest man-made object from Earth, is 130.83 AU away.\n\nThe closest known star [[Proxima Centauri]], however, is some 268,332 AU away, or over 9000 times farther away than Neptune.\n<!--\n1 A.U. = 149,597,870,700 meters,\n1 light-year = 9,460,730,472,580,800 meters or 63241.077 AU,\nVenus perihelion = 0.7184 AU\nNeptune perihelion = 29.809946 AU\nVoyager 1 distance (2014/sep) = 129.18 AU\nProxima = 4.243 \u00b1 0.002 light years away.\n-->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n!

Light in a vacuum travels around 300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) per second, so this is some 9.46\u00d710<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;kilometers (5.87 trillion miles) or 63,241&nbsp;AU in a year. Proxima Centauri is 4.243 light-years away.\n\nAnother way of understanding the vastness of interstellar distances is by scaling: one of the closest stars to the Sun, Alpha Centauri A (a Sun-like star), can be pictured by scaling down the [[astronomical unit|Earth\u2013Sun distance]] to one meter (~3.3&nbsp;ft). On this scale, the distance to Alpha Centauri A would be 271&nbsp;kilometers (169&nbsp;miles).\n\nThe fastest outward-bound spacecraft yet sent, [[Voyager 1#Interstellar mission|Voyager 1]], has covered 1/600th of a light-year in 30 years and is currently moving at 1/18,000th the speed of light. At this rate, a journey to Proxima Centauri would take 80,000 years.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/warp/scales.html | title= A Look at the Scaling | website= nasa.gov | publisher= NASA Glenn Research Center}}</ref>\n\n=== Required energy ===\nA significant factor contributing to the difficulty is the energy that must be supplied to obtain a reasonable travel time. A lower bound for the required energy is the [[kinetic energy]] K&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{frac||1|2}}&nbsp;mv<sup>2</sup> where m is the final mass. If [[deceleration]] on arrival is desired and cannot be achieved by any means other than the engines of the ship, then the lower bound for the required energy is doubled to mv<sup>2</sup>.<ref>{{cite arXiv |last=Millis |first=Marc G. |year=2011 |title=Energy, incessant obsolescence, and the first interstellar missions |eprint=1101.1066 |class=physics.gen-ph}}</ref>\n\nThe velocity for a manned round trip of a few decades to even the nearest star is several thousand times greater than those of present space vehicles.

Instead, assuming that a civilization is still on an increasing curve of propulsion system velocity, not yet having reached the limit, the resources should be invested in designing a better propulsion system. This is because a slow spacecraft would probably be passed by another mission sent later with more-advanced propulsion (the incessant obsolescence postulate).<ref name=\"Bob Forward 1996\" /> On the other hand, Andrew Kennedy has shown that if one calculates the journey time to a given destination as the rate of travel speed derived from growth (even exponential growth) increases, there is a clear minimum in the total time to that destination from now (see [[Wait Calculation|wait calculation]]).<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Interstellar Travel: The Wait Calculation and the Incentive Trap of Progress |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume=59 |number=7 |date=July 2006|pages=239\u2013246 |last= Kennedy |first=Andrew |url= http://www.jbis.org.uk/paper.php?p=2006.59.239 <!--|id=Refcode 2006.59.239-->|bibcode = 2006JBIS...59..239K }}</ref> Voyages undertaken before the minimum will be overtaken by those who leave at the minimum, whereas those who leave after the minimum will never overtake those who left at the minimum.\n\n== Prime targets for interstellar travel ==\nThere are 59 known [[stellar system]]s within 20 light years of the Sun, containing 81 visible stars.

Upon return, there would be a difference between the time elapsed on the astronaut's ship and the time elapsed on Earth.\n\nFor example, a spaceship could travel to a star 32 light-years away, initially accelerating at a constant 1.03g (i.e. 10.1&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>) for 1.32 years (ship time), then stopping its engines and coasting for the next 17.3 years (ship time) at a constant speed, then decelerating again for 1.32 ship-years, and coming to a stop at the destination. After a short visit the astronaut could return to Earth the same way. After the full round-trip, the clocks on board the ship show that 40 years have passed, but according to those on Earth, the ship comes back 76 years after launch.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of the astronaut, on-board clocks seem to be running normally. The star ahead seems to be approaching at a speed of 0.87 lightyears per ship-year. The universe would appear contracted along the direction of travel to half the size it had when the ship was at rest; the distance between that star and the Sun would seem to be 16 light years as measured by the astronaut.\n\nAt higher speeds, the time on board will run even slower, so the astronaut could travel to the center of the [[Milky Way]] (30,000 light years from Earth) and back in 40 years ship-time. But the speed according to Earth clocks will always be less than 1 lightyear per Earth year, so, when back home, the astronaut will find that more than 60 thousand years will have passed on Earth.\n\n==== Constant acceleration ====\n{{See also|Space travel using constant acceleration}}\n\n[[File:Roundtriptimes.png|thumb|300px|right|This plot shows a ship capable of 1-[[Gravitational acceleration|g]] (10&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> or about 1.0 ly/y<sup>2</sup>) \"felt\" or proper-acceleration<ref>{{cite web | title= Clock paradox III | url= http://www.eftaylor.com/pub/spacetime/STP1stEdExercP81to100.pdf}} {{cite book | author1= Taylor, Edwin F. | author2= Wheeler, John Archibald | date= 1966 | title= Spacetime Physics | publisher= W.H.

A constant acceleration journey is one where the propulsion system accelerates the ship at a constant rate for the first half of the journey, and then decelerates for the second half, so that it arrives at the destination stationary relative to where it began.  If this were performed with an acceleration similar to that experienced at the Earth's surface, it would have the added advantage of producing artificial \"gravity\" for the crew. Supplying the energy required, however, would be prohibitively expensive with current technology.<ref>Crowell, Benjamin (2011), Light and Matter Section 4.3</ref>\n\nFrom the perspective of a planetary observer, the ship will appear to accelerate steadily at first, but then more gradually as it approaches the speed of light (which it cannot exceed).

In an ion engine, electric power is used to create charged particles of the fuel, usually the gas xenon, and accelerate them to extremely high velocities. The exhaust velocity of conventional rockets is limited by the chemical energy stored in the fuel\u2019s molecular bonds, which limits the thrust to about 5&nbsp;km/s.  This gives them power (for lift-off from Earth, for example) but limits the top speed. By contrast, ion engines have low force, but the top speed in principle is limited only by the electrical power available on the spacecraft and on the gas ions being accelerated. The exhaust speed of the charged particles range from 15&nbsp;km/s to 35&nbsp;km/s.<ref name=\"http://www.iflscience.com\">{{citation | url= http://www.iflscience.com/space/dawn-new-era-revolutionary-ion-engine-took-spacecraft-ceres | title= Dawn Of A New Era: The Revolutionary Ion Engine That Took Spacecraft To Ceres}}</ref>\n\n==== Nuclear fission powered ====\n\n===== Fission-electric =====\nNuclear-electric or plasma engines, operating for long periods at low thrust and powered by fission reactors, have the potential to reach speeds much greater than chemically powered vehicles or nuclear-thermal rockets.

With fission, the energy output is approximately 0.1% of the total mass-energy of the reactor fuel and limits the effective exhaust velocity to about 5% of the velocity of light.

This is known as a [[fission-fragment rocket]].

In theory, a large number of stages could push a vehicle arbitrarily close to the speed of light.<ref name=\"L.D. Jaffe 1963, pp. 49-58\" /> These would \"burn\" such light element fuels as deuterium, tritium, <sup>3</sup>He, <sup>11</sup>B, and <sup>7</sup>Li. Because fusion yields about 0.3\u20130.9% of the mass of the nuclear fuel as released energy, it is energetically more favorable than fission, which releases <0.1% of the fuel's mass-energy. The maximum exhaust velocities potentially energetically available are correspondingly higher than for fission, typically 4\u201310% of c. However, the most easily achievable fusion reactions release a large fraction of their energy as high-energy neutrons, which are a significant source of energy loss. Thus, although these concepts seem to offer the best (nearest-term) prospects for travel to the nearest stars within a (long) human lifetime, they still involve massive technological and engineering difficulties, which may turn out to be intractable for decades or centuries.\n\n[[File:Daedalus ship.png|thumb|200px|right|Daedalus interstellar vehicle.]]Early studies include [[Project Daedalus]], performed by the [[British Interplanetary Society]] in 1973\u20131978, and [[Project Longshot]], a student project sponsored by [[NASA]] and the [[US Naval Academy]], completed in 1988.

Although these are still far short of the requirements for interstellar travel on human timescales, the study seems to represent a reasonable benchmark towards what may be approachable within several decades, which is not impossibly beyond the current state-of-the-art. Based on the concept's 2.2% [[burnup]] fraction it could achieve a pure fusion product exhaust velocity of ~3,000&nbsp;km/s.\n\n==== Antimatter rockets ====\n{{Main article|Antimatter rocket}}\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2015}}\nAn [[antimatter rocket]] would have a far higher energy density and specific impulse than any other proposed class of rocket.<ref name=\"crawist\" /> If energy resources and efficient production methods are found to make [[antimatter]] in the quantities required and store<ref>http://home.web.cern.ch/about/engineering/storing-antimatter</ref><ref>https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2011/06/05/alpha-quarter-hour/</ref> it safely, it would be theoretically possible to reach speeds of several tens of percent that of light.<ref name=\"crawist\" /> Whether antimatter propulsion could lead to the higher speeds (>90% that of light) at which relativistic [[time dilation]] would become more noticeable, thus making time pass at a slower rate for the travelers as perceived by an outside observer, is doubtful owing to the large quantity of antimatter that would be required.<ref name=\"crawist\" />\n\nSpeculating that production and storage of antimatter should become feasible, two further issues need to be considered. First, in the annihilation of antimatter, much of the energy is lost as high-energy [[gamma radiation]], and especially also as [[neutrino]]s, so that only about 40% of ''mc''<sup>2</sup> would actually be available if the antimatter were simply allowed to annihilate into radiations thermally.<ref name=\"crawist\" /> Even so, the energy available for propulsion would be substantially higher than the ~1% of ''mc''<sup>2</sup> yield of nuclear fusion, the next-best rival candidate.\n\nSecond, heat transfer from exhaust to the vehicle seems likely to transfer enormous wasted energy into the ship (e.g. for 0.1''g'' ship acceleration, approaching 0.3 trillion watts per ton of ship mass), considering the large fraction of the energy that goes into penetrating gamma rays. Even assuming shielding were provided to protect the payload (and passengers on a crewed vehicle), some of the energy would inevitably heat the vehicle, and may thereby prove a limiting factor if useful accelerations are to be achieved.\n\nMore recently, [[Friedwardt Winterberg]] proposed that a matter-antimatter GeV gamma ray laser photon rocket is possible by a relativistic proton-antiproton pinch discharge, where the recoil from the laser beam is transmitted by the [[M\u00f6ssbauer effect]] to the spacecraft.<ref name=\"AA-20120821\">{{cite journal |last=Winterberg |first=F. |title=Matter\u2013antimatter gigaelectron volt gamma ray laser rocket propulsion |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576512002640 |date=21 August 2012 |journal=[[Acta Astronautica]] |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=34\u201339 |accessdate=25 April 2015 |bibcode = 2012AcAau..81...34W |doi = 10.1016/j.actaastro.2012.07.001 }}</ref>\n\n==== Rockets with an external energy source ====\nRockets deriving their power from external sources, such as a [[laser]], could replace their internal energy source with an energy collector, potentially reducing the mass of the ship greatly and allowing much higher travel speeds.

Later calculations with more accurate estimates suggest that the thrust generated would be less than the drag caused by any conceivable scoop design.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Yet the idea is attractive because the fuel would be collected ''en route'' (commensurate with the concept of ''energy harvesting''), so the craft could theoretically accelerate to near the speed of light.\n\n==== Beamed propulsion ====\n[[File:Forward-sailcraft-scheme.png|thumb|This diagram illustrates [[Robert L.

[[Robert L. Forward]] proposed a means for decelerating an interstellar light sail in the destination star system without requiring a laser array to be present in that system. In this scheme, a smaller secondary sail is deployed to the rear of the spacecraft, whereas the large primary sail is detached from the craft to keep moving forward on its own.

The spacecraft itself as proposed used a 12,000,000 ton ball of frozen [[deuterium]] to power 12\u201324 thermonuclear pulse propulsion units. Twice as long as the [[Empire State Building]] and assembled in-orbit, the spacecraft was part of a larger project preceded by [[interstellar probe]]s and telescopic observation of target star systems.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=1142 |work=Centauri Dreams |title=A Note on the Enzmann Starship |first=Paul |last=Gilster |date=April 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Project Hyperion ===\nProject Hyperion, one of the projects of [[Icarus Interstellar]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Icarus Interstellar \u2013 Project Hyperion|url=http://www.icarusinterstellar.org/projects/project-hyperion/|accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== NASA research ===\n[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] has been researching interstellar travel since its formation, translating important foreign language papers and conducting early studies on applying fusion propulsion, in the 1960s, and laser propulsion, in the 1970s, to interstellar travel.\n\nThe [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] [[Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program]] (terminated in FY 2003 after a 6-year, $1.2-million study, because \"No breakthroughs appear imminent.\")<ref>[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp] \"Breakthrough Propulsion Physics\" project at NASA Glenn Research Center, Nov 19, 2008</ref> identified some breakthroughs that are needed for interstellar travel to be possible.<ref name=\"NASAWarpDriveBreakthruTechs\">[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/warp/warp.html http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/technology/warp/warp.html] ''Warp Drive, When?

Landis]] of NASA's [[Glenn Research Center]] states that a laser-powered interstellar sail ship could possibly be launched within 50 years, using new methods of space travel. \"I&nbsp;think that ultimately we're going to do it, it's just a question of when and who,\" Landis said in an interview. Rockets are too slow to send humans on interstellar missions. Instead, he envisions interstellar craft with extensive sails, propelled by laser light to about one-tenth the speed of light. It would take such a ship about 43 years to reach Alpha Centauri, if it passed through the system. Slowing down to stop at Alpha Centauri could increase the trip to 100 years,<ref name=\"Malik20020319\">[http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/generalscience/star_voyage_020319-1.html] Malik, Tariq, \"Sex and Society Aboard the First Starships.\" Science Tuesday, Space.com March 19, 2002.</ref> whereas a journey without slowing down raises the issue of making sufficiently accurate and useful observations and measurements during a fly-by.\n\n=== 100 Year Starship study ===\nThe [[100 Year Starship]] (100YSS) is the name of the overall effort that will, over the next century, work toward achieving interstellar travel.

Moreover, once the travelers arrive at their destination (by any means), they will not be able to travel down to the surface of the target world and set up a colony unless the atmosphere is non-lethal. The prospect of making such a journey, only to spend the rest of the colony's life inside a sealed habitat and venturing outside in a spacesuit, may eliminate many prospective targets from the list.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n<!--Please do not add links that already exist in the body of the article (like [[Bussard ramjet]]), or links that are space-related but not specifically with interstellar travel (like [[Eugen S\u00e4nger]] or [[Freeman Dyson]]).
