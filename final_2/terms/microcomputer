The predecessors to these computers, [[mainframe computer|mainframe]]s and [[minicomputer]]s, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the [[IBM System z]] machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[Computer monitor|screen]] for input and output) are also [[personal computer]]s (in the generic sense).<ref name=\"personalcomputer\">An early use of the term ''personal computer'' in 1962 predates microprocessor-based designs.

The French developers of the [[Micral]] N (1973) filed their patents with the term \"Micro-ordinateur\", a literal equivalent of \"Microcomputer\", to designate the first solid state machine designed with a microprocessor.\nIn the USA, the earliest models such as the [[Altair 8800]] were often sold as kits to be assembled by the user, and came with as little as 256 [[byte]]s of [[random access memory|RAM]], and no [[input/output]] devices other than indicator lights and switches, useful as a [[proof of concept]] to demonstrate what such a simple device could do.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ceruzzi|first=Paul|title=Computing: a concise history|year=2012|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9780262517676|page=105}}</ref> \nHowever, as microprocessors and [[semiconductor memory]] became less expensive, microcomputers in turn grew cheaper and easier to use:\n* Increasingly inexpensive logic chips such as the [[7400 series]] allowed cheap dedicated circuitry for improved [[user interface]]s such as [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] input, instead of simply a row of switches to toggle bits one at a time.\n* Use of [[audio cassette]]s for inexpensive data storage replaced manual re-entry of a program every time the device was powered on.\n* Large cheap arrays of silicon [[logic gates]] in the form of [[read-only memory]] and [[EPROM]]s allowed utility programs and self-[[booting]] [[kernel (computing)|kernel]]s to be stored within microcomputers. These [[stored program]]s could automatically load further more complex software from external storage devices without user intervention, to form an inexpensive [[turnkey system]] that does not require a computer expert to understand or to use the device.\n* [[Random access memory]] became cheap enough to afford dedicating approximately 1-2 kilobytes of memory to a [[video display controller]] [[frame buffer]], for a 40x25 or 80x25 text display or blocky color graphics on a common household [[television]]. This replaced the slow, complex, and expensive [[teletypewriter]] that was previously common as an interface to minicomputers and mainframes.\nAll these improvements in cost and usability resulted in an explosion in their popularity during the late 1970s and early 1980s.\nA large number of computer makers packaged microcomputers for use in small business  applications. By 1979, many companies such as [[Cromemco]], [[Processor Technology]], [[IMSAI]], [[North Star Computers]], [[SWTPC|Southwest Technical Products Corporation]], [[Ohio Scientific]], [[Altos Computer Systems]], [[Morrow Designs]] and others produced systems designed either for a resourceful end user or consulting firm to deliver business systems such as accounting, database management, and word processing to small businesses. This allowed businesses unable to afford leasing of a minicomputer or [[time-sharing]] service the opportunity to automate business functions, without (usually) hiring a full-time staff to operate the computers. A representative system of this era would have used an [[S100 bus]], an 8-bit processor such as an [[Intel 8080]] or [[Zilog Z80]], and either [[CP/M]] or [[MP/M]] operating system.\nThe increasing availability and power of [[desktop computer]]s for personal use attracted the attention of more software developers.  In time, and as the industry matured, the market for [[personal computer]]s standardized around [[IBM PC compatible]]s running [[DOS]], and later [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].\nModern desktop computers, [[video game console]]s, [[laptop]]s, [[tablet computer|tablet PC]]s, and many types of [[handheld device]]s, including [[mobile phone]]s, pocket [[calculator]]s, and industrial [[embedded system]]s, may all be considered examples of microcomputers according to the definition given above.\n\n== Colloquial use of the term ==\n\nEveryday use of the expression \"microcomputer\" (and in particular the \"micro\" abbreviation) has declined significantly from the mid-1980s and has declined in commonplace usage since 2000.<ref>\"microcomputer, n.\". OED Online. December 2013. Oxford University Press. 15 February 2014 <http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/117935?redirectedFrom=microcomputer>.</ref> The term is most commonly associated with the first wave of all-in-one [[8-bit]] [[home computer]]s and small business microcomputers (such as the [[Apple II family|Apple II]], [[Commodore 64]], [[BBC Micro]], and [[TRS 80]]). Although, or perhaps because, an increasingly diverse range of modern microprocessor-based devices fit the definition of \"microcomputer,\" they are no longer referred to as such in everyday speech.\n\nIn common usage, \"microcomputer\" has been largely supplanted by the term \"[[personal computer]]\" or \"PC,\" which specifies a computer that has been designed to be used by one individual at a time, a term first coined in 1959.<ref>\"personal computer, n.\".

Oxford University Press. 15 February 2014 <http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/262572?redirectedFrom=personal+computer></ref> IBM first promoted the term \"personal computer\" to differentiate themselves from other microcomputers, often called \"[[home computer]]s\", and also IBM's own mainframes and minicomputers{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} .  However, following its release, the IBM PC itself was widely imitated, as well as the term{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.  The component parts were commonly available to producers and the [[BIOS]] was [[reverse engineered]] through [[cleanroom design]] techniques. [[IBM PC compatible]] \"clones\" became commonplace, and the terms \"personal computer,\" and especially \"PC\" stuck with the general public; often specifically for a DOS or (nowadays) Windows-compatible computer.\n\nSince the advent of [[microcontroller]]s (monolithic integrated circuits containing RAM, ROM and CPU all onboard), the term \"micro\" is more commonly used to refer to that meaning.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n== Description ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}\nMonitors, keyboards and other devices for input and output may be integrated or separate. Computer memory in the form of [[RAM]], and at least one other less volatile, memory storage device are usually combined with the CPU on a [[system bus]] in one unit. Other devices that make up a complete microcomputer system include batteries, a [[power supply]] unit, a keyboard and various input/output devices used to convey information to and from a human operator ([[computer printer|printers]], [[computer display|monitors]], [[human interface device]]s).  Microcomputers are designed to serve only one user at a time, although they can often be modified with software or hardware to concurrently serve more than one user.  Microcomputers fit well on or under desks or tables, so that they are within easy access of users.  Bigger computers like [[minicomputer]]s, [[mainframe computer|mainframes]], and [[supercomputer]]s take up large [[cabinet (computer)|cabinet]]s or even dedicated rooms.\n\nA microcomputer comes equipped with at least one type of data storage, usually [[random-access memory|RAM]].  Although some microcomputers (particularly early 8-bit home micros) perform  tasks using RAM alone, some form of [[secondary storage]] is normally desirable. In the early days of home micros, this was often a data [[cassette deck]] (in many cases as an external unit). Later, secondary storage (particularly in the form of [[floppy disk]] and [[hard disk]] drives) were built into the microcomputer case.\n\n== History ==\n\n[[Image:Early Personal Computers.jpg|thumb|320px|right|A collection of early microcomputers, including a [[Processor Technology]] SOL-20 (top shelf, right), an MITS [[Altair 8800]] (second shelf, left), a [[TV Typewriter]] (third shelf, center), and an [[Apple I]] in the case at far right.]]\n\nAlthough they did not contain any microprocessors, but were built around [[transistor-transistor logic]] (TTL), [[Hewlett-Packard]] calculators as far back as 1968 had various levels of programmability such that could be called microcomputers. The HP 9100B (1968) had rudimentary conditional (if) statements, statement line numbers, jump statements ([[go to]]), registers that could be used as variables, and primitive subroutines. The programming language resembled [[assembly language]] in many ways. Later models incrementally added more features, including the [[BASIC]] programming language (HP 9830A in 1971). Some models had tape storage and small printers. However, displays were limited to one line at a time. [http://www.hpmuseum.org/] The [[Hewlett Packard 9100A|HP 9100A]] was referred to as a [[personal computer]] in an advertisement in a 1968 [[Science (journal)|Science]] magazine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/museum/personalsystems/0021/other/0021ad.pdf |title=Powerful Computing Genie |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> but that advertisement was quickly dropped.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/issue_pdf/frontmatter_pdf/162/3852.pdf |title=Restoring the Balance Between Analysis and Computation |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref>  HP was reluctant to sell them as \"computers\" because the perception at that time was that a computer had to be big in size to be powerful, and thus decided to market them as calculators.  Additionally, at that time, people were more likely to buy calculators than computers, and, purchasing agents also preferred the term \"calculator\" because purchasing a \"computer\" required additional layers of purchasing authority approvals.

While it contains no microprocessor, the [[instruction set]] of its custom TTL processor was the basis of the instruction set for the [[Intel 8008]], and for practical purposes the system behaves approximately as if it contains an 8008.  This is because Intel was the contractor in charge of developing the Datapoint's CPU, but ultimately CTC rejected the 8008 design because it needed 20 support chips.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computermuseum.li/Testpage/MicroprocessorHistory.htm |title=MicroprocessorHistory |publisher=Computermuseum.li |date=1971-11-15 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref>\n\nAnother early system, the [[Kenbak-1]], was released in 1971. Like the Datapoint 2200, it used discrete [[transistor\u2013transistor logic]] instead of a microprocessor, but it functioned like a microcomputer in most ways. It was marketed as an educational and hobbyist tool, but it was not a commercial success; production ceased shortly after introduction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vintage-computer.com/kenbak-1.shtml|title=Kenbak-1|website=The Vintage Computer}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, a French team headed by Fran\u00e7ois Gernelle within a small company, R\u00e9alisations & Etudes Electroniqes (R2E), developed and patented a computer based on a microprocessor \u2013 the Intel 8008 8-bit microprocessor. This [[Micral|Micral-N]] was marketed in early 1973 as a \"Micro-ordinateur\" or ''microcomputer'', mainly for scientific and process-control applications. About a hundred [[Micral|Micral-N]] were installed in the next two years, followed by a new version based on the Intel 8080. Meanwhile, another French team developed the Alvan, a small computer for office automation which found clients in banks and other sectors. The first version was based on LSI chips with an Intel 8008 as peripheral controller (keyboard, monitor and printer), before adopting the Zilog Z80 as main processor.\n\nIn 1972, a Sacramento State University team led by Bill Pentz built the Sac State 8008 computer,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digibarn.com/stories/bill-pentz-story/index.html |title=Digibarn Stories: Bill Pentz and (Earliest) History of the Microcomputer (August 2008) |publisher=Digibarn.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref> able to handle thousands of patients' medical records.  The Sac State 8008 was designed with the Intel 8008. It had a full set of hardware and software components: a disk operating system included in a series of programmable read-only memory chips (PROMs); 8 Kilobytes of RAM; IBM's Basic Assembly Language (BAL); a hard drive; a color display; a printer output; a 150 bit/s serial interface for connecting to a mainframe; and even the world's first microcomputer front panel.<ref>{{cite web|last=Terdiman |first=Daniel |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-10429544-52.html |title=Inside the world's long-lost first microcomputer &#124; Geek Gestalt&nbsp;\u2014 CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2010-01-08 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref>\n\nVirtually all early microcomputers were essentially boxes with lights and switches; one had to read and understand binary numbers and machine language to program and use them (the Datapoint 2200 was a striking exception, bearing a modern design based on a monitor, keyboard, and tape and disk drives).  Of the early \"box of switches\"-type microcomputers, the MITS [[Altair 8800]] (1975) was arguably the most famous.  Most of these simple, early microcomputers were sold as [[electronic kits]]\u2014bags full of loose components which the buyer had to solder together before the system could be used.\n\n[[Image:PDP-11-M7270.jpg|thumb|Microcomputer module LSI-11/2]]\n\nThe period from about 1971 to 1976 is sometimes called the [[:Category:Early microcomputers|first generation]] of microcomputers. Many companies such as [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]],<ref>{{cite web\n |title = 16-bit timeline\n |url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gbell/digital/timeline/16-bit.htm\n}}</ref> [[National Semiconductor]],<ref>{{cite magazine\n |title = Paper Tape Readers Work With IMP Micros\n |magazine = Computerworld\n |date = 23 Oct 1974\n |page = 28\n |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GpEtWjI3whwC&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q&f=false\n}}</ref> [[Texas Instruments]]<ref>{{cite magazine\n |title = Upward Compatible Software and Downward Compatible Price\n |magazine = Computerworld\n |date = 10 Dec 1975\n |page = 49\n |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=shitkFDw7DkC&pg=PA49#v=onepage&q&f=false\n}}</ref> offered their microcomputers for use in terminal control, peripheral device interface control and industrial machine control. There were also machines for engineering development and hobbyist personal use.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kawCnk4051wC&lpg=PA139&pg=PA154#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Computer Adventures}}</ref> In 1975, the [[Processor Technology]] [[SOL-20]] was designed, which consisted of one board which included all the parts of the computer system. The [[SOL-20]] had built-in EPROM software which eliminated the need for rows of switches and lights. The [[Altair 8800|MITS Altair]] just mentioned played an instrumental role in sparking significant hobbyist interest, which itself eventually led to the founding and success of many well-known [[personal computer]] hardware and software companies, such as [[Microsoft]] and [[Apple Computer]]. Although the Altair itself was only a mild commercial success, it helped spark a huge industry.\n\nBy 1977, the introduction of the second generation, known as [[home computer]]s, made microcomputers considerably easier to use than their predecessors because their predecessors' operation often demanded thorough familiarity with practical electronics. The ability to connect to a monitor (screen) or TV set allowed visual manipulation of text and numbers. The [[BASIC]] language, which was easier to learn and use than raw machine language, became a standard feature. These features were already common in [[minicomputer]]s, with which many hobbyists and early produces were familiar.\n\nIn 1979, the launch of the [[VisiCalc]] [[spreadsheet]] (initially for the [[Apple II family|Apple II]]) first turned the microcomputer from a hobby for computer enthusiasts into a business tool. After the 1981 release by IBM of its [[IBM PC]], the term [[personal computer]] became generally used for microcomputers compatible with the IBM PC architecture ([[PC compatible]]).\n\nIn 2012, the [[Raspberry Pi]] credit-card-sized single-board computer was launched, directly inspired by Acorn's BBC Micro of 1981, and including support for [[BBC BASIC]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.businessweekly.co.uk/blog/cambridge-today-tony-quested/13664-raspberry-blown-at-cambridge-software-detractors | title=Raspberry blown at Cambridge software detractors | work=Business Weekly | date=29 February 2012 | accessdate=13 March 2012 | author= Quested, Tony}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[History of computing hardware (1960s-present)]]\n* [[Lists of microcomputers]]\n* [[Mainframe computer]]\n* [[Minicomputer]]\n* [[Personal computer]]\n* [[Supercomputer]]\n* [[Single-board computer]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{reflist|500px}}\n\n{{Computer sizes}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Microcomputers|*Microcomputer]]\n[[Category:Computers]]"}]}}}}
