Note how [[asteroid family]] clumps are not discernible on the left.]] \nThe '''proper orbital elements''' of an orbit are constants of motion of an object in space that remain practically unchanged over an astronomically long timescale. The term is usually used to describe the three quantities:\n*''proper semimajor axis'' (''a<sub>p</sub>''),\n*''proper eccentricity'' (''e<sub>p</sub>''), and \n*''proper inclination'' (''i<sub>p</sub>'').\n\nThe '''proper elements''' can be contrasted with the [[osculating orbit|osculating]] Keplerian [[orbital elements]] observed at a particular time or [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]], such as the [[semi-major axis]], [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], and [[inclination]]. Those osculating elements change in a [[quasi-periodic motion|quasi-periodic]] and (in principle) predictable manner due to such effects as perturbations from planets or other bodies, and precession (e.g. [[perihelion precession]]). In the [[Solar System]], such changes usually occur on timescales of thousands of years, while proper elements are meant to be practically constant over at least tens of millions of years. \n\nFor most bodies, the osculating elements are relatively close to the proper elements because precession and perturbation effects are relatively small (see diagram). For over 99% of [[asteroid]]s in the [[asteroid belt]], the differences are less than 0.02 AU (for [[semi-major axis]] ''a''), 0.1 (for [[Eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] ''e''), and 2\u00b0 (for [[inclination]] ''i''). \n\nNevertheless, this difference is non-negligible for any purposes where precision is of importance. As an example, the asteroid [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] has osculating orbital elements (at [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] November 26, 2005)\n{| align=\"center\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; margin-left:15px;\" cellpadding=\"5\" \n!

Such a simulation must take into account many details of celestial mechanics including perturbations by the planets. Subsequently, one extracts quantities from the simulation which remain unchanged over this long timespan; for example, the mean inclination, eccentricity, and semi-major axis. These are the proper orbital elements.\n\nHistorically, various approximate analytic calculations were made, starting with those of [[Kiyotsugu Hirayama]] in the early 20th century. Later analytic methods often included thousands of perturbing corrections for each particular object. Presently, the method of choice is to use a computer to numerically integrate the equations of [[celestial dynamics]], and extract constants of motion directly from a numerical analysis of the predicted positions. \n\nAt present the most prominent use of proper orbital elements is in the study of [[asteroid family|asteroid families]], following in the footsteps of the pioneering work of Hirayama. A [[Mars-crosser asteroid]] [[132 Aethra]] is the lowest numbered asteroid to not have any proper orbital elements.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Perturbation (astronomy)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Z.
