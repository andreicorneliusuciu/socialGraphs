It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric  [[current (electricity)|current]] of one [[ampere]] passes through a [[resistance (electricity)|resistance]] of one [[ohm]] for one second.  It is named after the English physicist [[James Prescott Joule]] (1818\u20131889).<ref>[http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/joule American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language], Online Edition (2009).

This relationship can be used to define the volt.\n* The work required to produce one [[watt]] of [[Power (physics)|power]] for one [[second]], or one \"watt second\" (W\u00b7s) (compare [[kilowatt hour]] - 3.6 megajoules). This relationship can be used to define the watt.\n\n==Usage==\n{{SI unit lowercase|James Prescott Joule|joule|J}}\n\n==Confusion with newton metre==\n{{Main article|newton metre}}\nIn [[mechanics]], the concept of [[force]] (in some direction) has a close analog in the concept of [[torque]] (about some angle):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Linear !! Angular\n|-\n| force || torque\n|-\n| [[mass]] || [[moment of inertia]]\n|-\n| distance || angle\n|}\n\nA result of this similarity is that the SI unit for torque is the [[newton metre]], which works out [[algebra|algebraically]] to have the same [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]] as the Joule. But they are not interchangeable. The [[CGPM]] has given the unit of [[energy]] the name ''Joule'', but has not given the unit of torque any special name, hence it is simply the newton metre (N\u00b7m) - a compound name derived from its constituent parts.<ref name=BIPM2/> The use of newton metres for torque and joules for energy is helpful to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications.<ref name=BIPM2/>\n\nThe distinction may be seen also in the fact that energy is a [[scalar]] &ndash; the [[dot product]] of a [[vector]] force and a vector displacement. By contrast, torque is a vector &ndash; the [[cross product]] of a distance vector and a force vector. Torque and energy are related to one another by the equation\n:<math>E= \\tau \\theta\\ ,</math>\nwhere ''E'' is energy, ''\u03c4'' is (the [[Magnitude_(mathematics)#Euclidean_vector_space|vector magnitude]] of) torque, and ''\u03b8'' is the angle swept (in [[radian]]s). Since radians are dimensionless, it follows that torque and energy have the same dimensions.\n\n== Practical examples ==\nOne joule in everyday life represents approximately:\n* The energy required to lift a medium-size tomato (100&nbsp;g) 1 meter vertically from the surface of the Earth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthaliciousness.com/blog/How-much-is-100-grams.php|title=How much is 100 grams?|website=HealthAliciousNess|access-date=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n* The energy released when that same tomato falls back down to the ground.\n* The energy required to accelerate a 1&nbsp;kg mass at 1 m\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup> through a 1 m distance in space.\n* The [[heat]] required to raise the temperature of 1&nbsp;g of water by 0.24&nbsp;K.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/heat-units-d_664.html |title=Units of Heat - BTU, Calorie and Joule |publisher=Engineeringtoolbox.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16}}</ref>\n* The typical energy released as heat by a person at rest every 1/60 second (approximately 17&nbsp;ms).<ref>This is called the [[basal metabolic rate]].
