The [[SI prefix|prefix]] ''[[tera-|tera]]'' represents the fourth power of 1000, and means 10<sup>12</sup> in the [[International System of Units]] (SI), and therefore one terabyte is one [[10^12|trillion]] ([[short scale]]) bytes. The unit symbol for the terabyte is '''TB'''.\n\n1 TB = {{gaps|1|000|000|000|000|bytes}} = {{gaps|10<sup>12</sup>|bytes}} = {{gaps|1|000|[[gigabyte]]s}}.\n\nA related unit, the [[tebibyte]] (TiB), using a [[binary prefix]], is equal to 1024<sup>4</sup> bytes. One terabyte is about 0.9095 TiB. Despite the introduction of these standardized binary prefixes, the terabyte is still also commonly used in some computer [[operating system]]s, primarily [[Microsoft Windows]], to denote {{gaps|1|099|511|627|776}} (1024<sup>4</sup> or 2<sup>40</sup>) bytes for disk drive capacity.<ref>[http://knowledge.seagate.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/194563en How operating systems report drive capacity], Seagate Inc.</ref><ref>[http://support.seagate.com/kbimg/172191-1.jpg Windows disk space using TB as a binary value, from Seagate.com]</ref>\n\n==History==\n<!---The following is an attempt to be reasonable; let's not start an edit war over which was the first obscure usage of terabyte in one form or another -->\nEarly if not first usage of terabyte in selected products:\n* Supercomputer mass storage: ca. 1992 (decimal usage)  <ref>Vetter, R.
