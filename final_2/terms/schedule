The process of creating a schedule - deciding how to order these tasks and how to commit resources between the variety of possible tasks - is called '''scheduling''',<ref>''See'' Hojjat Adeli, Asim Karim, ''Construction Scheduling, Cost Optimization and Management'' (2003), p. 54.</ref><ref name= \"Zwikael\">Ofer Zwikael, John Smyrk, ''Project Management for the Creation of Organisational Value'' (2011), p. 196: \"The process is called scheduling, the output from which is a timetable of some form\".\n</ref> and a person responsible for making a particular schedule may be called a '''scheduler'''.

Schedules that do not set forth specific times for events to occur may instead list [[algorithm]]ically an expected order in which events either can or must take place.\n\nIn some situations, schedules can be uncertain, such as where the conduct of daily life relies on environmental factors outside of human control.<ref>Compare some aspects of hunter-gatherer society:\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Lee\n| first1                = Richard B.\n| author-link1          = Richard Borshay Lee\n| chapter               = What hunters do for a living, or, how to make out on scarce resources\n| editor1-last          = Gowdy\n| editor1-first         = John\n| title                 = Limited Wants, Unlimited Means: A Reader On Hunter-Gatherer Economics And The Environment\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=YiKLuuEIUEoC\n| publisher             = Island Press\n| publication-date      = 1998\n| page                  = 52\n| isbn                  = 9781559635554\n| accessdate            = 2014-09-09\n| quote                 = The hunters[' ...] schedule is uneven. it is not unusual for a man to hunt avidly for a week and then do no hunting at all for two or three weeks.

Vacations are a time to relax and take a time out from your daily responsibilities\".</ref>\n\n==Kinds of schedules==\n\n===Publicly available schedules===\nCertain kinds of schedules reflect information that is generally made available to the public, so that members of the public can plan certain activities around them. These may include things like:\n* Hours of operation of businesses, tourist attractions, and government offices, which allow consumers of these services to know when they can obtain them.\n* Transportation schedules, such as [[airline timetable]]s, [[train schedule]]s, [[bus schedule]]s, and various [[public transport timetable]]s are published to allow commuters to plan their travels. From the perspective of the organization responsible for making transportation available, schedules must provide for the possibility of [[schedule delay]], a term in transport modeling which refers to a difference between a desired time of arrival or departure and the actual time. Despite the use of \"delay\", it can refer to a difference in either the early or late direction.\n* In [[broadcast programming]], the minute planning of the content of a radio or television broadcast channel, the result of that activity is the generation of a list of shows to be broadcast at regular times or at specific times, which is then distributed to the public so that the potential audience for the show will know when it will be available to them.\n* [[Concert]]s and [[sporting events]] are typically scheduled so that fans can plan to buy tickets and attend the events.\n\n===Internal schedules===\nAn internal schedule is a schedule that is only of importance to the people who must directly abide by it. It has been noted that \"groups often begin with a schedule imposed from the outside, but effective groups also develop an internal schedule that sets goals for the completion of micro-tasks\".<ref>Michael E. Gorman, ''Transforming Nature: Ethics, Invention and Discovery'' (1998), p. 308.</ref> Unlike schedules for public events or publicly available amenities, there is no need to go to the time and effort of publicizing the internal schedule. To the contrary, an internal schedule may be kept confidential as a matter of security or propriety.\n\nAn example of an internal schedule is a [[Schedule (workplace)|workplace schedule]], which lists the hours that specific employees are expected to be in a workplace, ensure sufficient staffing at all times while in some instances avoiding overstaffing. A work schedule for a business that is open to the public must correspond to the hours of operation of the business, so that employees are available at times when customers are able to use the services of the business. One common method of scheduling employees to ensure the availability of appropriate resources is a [[Gantt chart]]. Another example of an internal schedule is the class schedule of an individual student, indicating what days and times their classes will be held.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n====Project management scheduling====\n{{main|Schedule (project management)}}\nA schedule may also involve the completion of a project with which the public has no interaction public prior to its completion. In [[project management]], a formal schedule will often be created as an initial step in carrying out a specific project, such as the construction of a building, development of a product, or launch of a program. Establishing a [[Schedule (project management)|project management schedule]] involves listing milestones, activities, and deliverables with intended start and finish dates, of which the scheduling of employees may be an element.<ref>Identifying milestones [http://philrichardson.co.uk/pa450/howdos/milestones.htm \"Identify and Describe MILESTONES and CONTROL POINTS\"] ''Phil Richardson''</ref> A [[Scheduling (production processes)|production process schedule]] is used for the planning of the production or the operation, while a [[Schedule (resource)|resource schedule]] aids in the logistical planning for sharing resources among several entities.\n\nIn such cases, a schedule \"is obtained by estimating the duration of each task and noting any dependencies amongst those tasks\".<ref name=\"Zwikael\"/> Dependencies, in turn, are tasks that must be completed in order to make other tasks possible, such as renting a truck before loading materials on the truck (since nothing can be loaded until the truck is available for things to be loaded on).<ref name=\"Zwikael\"/> Scheduling of projects, therefore, requires the identification of all of the tasks necessary to complete the project, and the earliest time at which each task can be completed.<ref name=\"Zwikael\"/> In creating a schedule, a certain amount of time is usually set aside as a contingency against unforeseen days. This time is called scheduling variance,<ref>Calin M. Popescu, ''Project Planning, Scheduling, and Control in Construction'' (1995), p. 522.</ref> or [[Float (project management)|float]],<ref name=\"pmbok4\">{{cite book|last=Project Management Institute| title=A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide)| publisher=Project Management Institute, 4 Original edition (December 31, 2008)}}</ref> and is a core concept for the [[critical path method]].\n\n====In computing====\nScheduling is important as an internal process in [[computer science]], wherein a [[Schedule (computer science)|schedule]] is a list of actions from a set of transactions in databases, and [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] is the way various processes are assigned in [[computer multitasking]] and multiprocessing operating system design. This kind of scheduling is incorporated into the computer program, and the user may be completely unaware of what tasks are being carried out and when. Scheduling operations and issues in computing may include:\n* The operation of a [[network scheduler]] or packet scheduler, an arbiter program that manages the movement of certain pieces of information in the computer.\n* [[Open-shop scheduling]], [[Job Shop Scheduling]], [[Flow Shop Scheduling Problem]], optimization problems in computer science.\n* [[I/O scheduling]], the order in which I/O requests are submitted to a block device in operating systems.\n* [[Job scheduler]], an enterprise software application in charge of unattended background executions.\n\n====In wireless communications====\nWireless networks should have a flexible service architecture to integrate different types of services on a single air-interface because terminals have different service requirements. On top of the flexible service architecture, effective QoS management schemes are also needed. Therefore, wireless resources need to be shared among all terminals carefully and it is desirable to schedule the usage of wireless resources as efficiently as possible, while maximizing the overall network performance.<ref name=Miao>{{cite book|author1=[[Guowang Miao]]|author2=Guocong Song|title=Energy and spectrum efficient wireless network design|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=1107039886|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n====In operations research====\nThe scheduling of resources, usually subject to constraints, is the subject of several problems that are in the area of research known as [[operations research]], usually in terms of finding an optimal solution or method for solving.\n\nFor example, the [[nurse scheduling problem]] is concerned with scheduling a number of employees with typical constraints such as rotation of shifts, limits on overtime, etc. The [[travelling salesman problem]] is concerned with scheduling a series of journeys to minimize time or distance. Some of these problems may be solved efficiently with [[linear programming]], but many scheduling problems require integer variables. Although efficient algorithms exist to give integer solutions in some situations (see [[Flow network|network flow]] models), most problems that require integer solutions cannot yet be solved efficiently.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n{{wiktionary|schedule|scheduling}}\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Schedule}}\n* [[Calendaring software]]\n* [[Employee scheduling software]]\n* [[Notation for theoretic scheduling problems]]\n\n[[Category:Time management]]\n[[Category:Operations research]]\n[[Category:Project management]]"}]}}}}
