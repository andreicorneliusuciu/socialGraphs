This contrasts with [[upload]]ing, where data is sent ''to'' a remote server.\n\nA ''download'' is a file offered for downloading or that has been downloaded, or the process of receiving such a file.\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Upstream-downstream.svg|thumb|Download data is sent [[downstream (networking)|downstream]] to an end-user, [[upstream (networking)|upstream]] from the provider]]\n\nDownloading generally transfers entire files for local storage and later use, as contrasted with [[streaming media|streaming]], where the data is used nearly immediately, while the transmission is still in progress, and which may not be stored long-term. Increasingly, websites that offer streaming media or media displayed  in-browser, such as [[YouTube]], and which place restrictions on the ability of users to save these materials to their computers after they have been received.\n\nDownloading is not the same as [[data transfer]]; moving or copying data between two storage devices would be [[data transfer]], but receiving data from the Internet would be ''downloading''.\n\n==Copyright==\n{{Main|Copyright aspects of downloading and streaming}}\n\nDownloading copyrighted content without appropriate permissions may constitute [[copyright infringement]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary|download}}\n*[[Bandwidth (computing)|Bandwidth]]\n*[[Digital distribution]]\n*[[Music download]]\n*[[Peer-to-peer]]\n*[[Sideloading|Sideload]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commonscat-inline|Download icons}}\n{{Download managers}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Computer networking]]\n[[Category:Data transmission]]\n[[Category:Network file transfer protocols]]\n[[Category:Servers (computing)]]"}]}}}}
