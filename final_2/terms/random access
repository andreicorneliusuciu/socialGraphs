As a rule, the assumption is that each element can be accessed roughly as easily and efficiently as any other, no matter how many elements may be in the set, nor how many coordinates may be available for addressing the data. For example, data might be stored notionally in a single sequence like a row, in two dimensions like rows and columns on a surface, or in multiple dimensions. However, given all the coordinates, a program can access each record about as quickly and easily as any other, and in particular, access it in time to be of value to the user. In this sense the choice of data item is arbitrary in the sense that no matter which item is sought, all that is needed to find it, is its address, that is to say, the coordinates at which it is located, such as its row and column (or its track and record number on a magnetic drum). At first the term \"random access\" was used because the process had to be capable of finding records no matter in which sequence they were required.<ref name=\"Exposition1957\">{{cite book|author=National Computer Conference and Exposition|title=Proceedings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lQQrAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=2 October 2013|year=1957}}</ref> However, soon the term \"direct access\" gained favour because one could directly retrieve a record, no matter what its position might be.<ref name=\"Division1966\">{{cite book|author=International Business Machines Corporation.

The opposite is [[sequential access]], where a remote element takes longer time to access.[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc938619.aspx]\n\nA typical illustration of this distinction is to compare an ancient [[scroll (parchment)|scroll]] (sequential; all material prior to the data needed must be unrolled) and the [[book]] (direct: can be immediately flipped open to any arbitrary [[page (paper)|page]]). A more modern example is a cassette tape (sequential &mdash; one must fast forward through earlier songs to get to later ones) and a [[CD]] (direct access &mdash; one can skip to the track wanted, knowing that it would be the one retrieved).\n\nIn [[data structure]]s, direct access implies the ability to access any entry in a [[List (computing)|list]] in [[constant time]] (independent of its position in the list and of list's size). Very few data structures can guarantee this, other than [[array data structure|array]]s (and related structures like [[dynamic array]]s). Direct access is required, or at least valuable, in many algorithms such as [[binary search]], [[integer sorting]] or certain versions of [[sieve of Eratosthenes]].<ref name=\"KNUTH1969\">{{cite book|author=D.

[[Self-balancing binary search tree]]s may provide an acceptable compromise, where access time is not equal for all members of a collection, but the maximum time to retrieve a given member grows only [[logarithmically]] with its size.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Data stream]]\n*[[Random-access machine]]\n*[[Locality of reference]]\n\n[[Category:Computer memory]]"}]}}}}
