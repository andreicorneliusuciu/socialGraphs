They are particularly useful when the spacecraft must be rotated by very small amounts, such as keeping a telescope pointed at a star.  They may also reduce the [[payload fraction|mass fraction]] needed for fuel. This is accomplished by equipping the spacecraft with an electric motor attached to a flywheel which, when its rotation speed is changed, causes the spacecraft to begin to counter-rotate proportionately through [[Angular momentum#Conservation of angular momentum|conservation of angular momentum]]. Reaction wheels can rotate a spacecraft only around its center of mass (see [[torque]]); they are not capable of moving the spacecraft from one place to another (see [[translation (physics)|translational force]]). Reaction wheels work around a nominal zero rotation speed. However, external torques on the spacecraft may  require a gradual buildup of reaction wheel rotation speed to maintain the spacecraft in a fixed orientation.\n\nA reaction wheel is sometimes operated as (and referred to as) a '''momentum wheel''', by operating it at a constant (or near-constant) rotation speed, in order to imbue a satellite with a large amount of stored angular momentum. Doing so alters the spacecraft's rotational dynamics so that disturbance torques perpendicular to one axis of the satellite (the axis parallel to the wheel's spin axis) do not result directly in spacecraft angular motion about the same axis as the disturbance torque; instead, they result in (generally smaller) angular motion ([[precession]]) of that spacecraft axis about a perpendicular axis. This has the effect of tending to stabilize that spacecraft axis to point in a nearly-fixed direction, allowing for a less-complicated attitude control system. Satellites using this \"momentum-bias\" stabilization approach include [[SCISAT-1]]; by orienting the momentum wheel's axis to be parallel to the orbit-normal vector, this satellite is in a \"pitch momentum bias\" configuration.\n\nA [[control moment gyroscope]] (CMG) is a related but different type of attitude actuator, generally consisting of a momentum wheel mounted in a one-axis or two-axis [[gimbal]]. When mounted to a rigid spacecraft, applying a constant torque to the wheel using one of the gimbal motors causes the spacecraft to develop a constant angular velocity about a perpendicular axis, thus allowing control of the spacecraft's pointing direction. CMGs are generally able to produce larger sustained torques than RWs with less motor heating, and are preferentially used in larger and/or more-agile spacecraft, including [[Skylab]], [[Mir]], and the [[International Space Station]].\n\n== Implementation ==\nReaction wheels are usually implemented as special [[electric motor]]s, mounted along at least three directions: for example along the x, y and z axes provides no redundancy; while mounting four along tetrahedral axes provides redundancy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kleinsatelliten.de/flying_laptop/systeme/lageregelung.en.html|title=Attitude Control|publisher=Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart Institut f\u00fcr Raumfahrtsysteme|accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref> Changes in speed  (in either direction) are controlled electronically by computer. The strength of the materials used in a reaction wheel determine the speed at which the wheel would come apart, and therefore how much [[angular momentum]] it can store.\n\nSince the reaction wheel is a small fraction of the spacecraft's total mass, easily controlled, temporary changes in its speed result in small changes in angle. The wheels therefore permit very precise changes in a spacecraft's [[attitude control|attitude]]. For this reason, reaction wheels are often used to aim spacecraft carrying cameras or telescopes.\n\nOver time, reaction wheels may build up stored momentum that needs to be cancelled. Designers therefore supplement reaction wheel systems with other attitude control mechanisms. In the presence of a magnetic field (as in low Earth orbit), a spacecraft can employ [[magnetorquer]]s (better known as torque rods) to transfer angular momentum to the Earth through its planetary magnetic field.  In the absence of a magnetic field, the most efficient practice is to use either high-efficiency attitude jets such as [[ion thruster]]s, or small, lightweight [[solar sail]]s placed in locations away from the spacecraft's center of mass, such as on solar cell arrays or projecting masts.  Most spacecraft, however, also need fast pointing, and cannot afford the extra mass of three attitude control systems.  Designers therefore usually use conventional [[monopropellant rocket|monopropellant]] [[vernier engine]]s for all these purposes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n== Failures and replacement ==\nThe failure of one or more reaction wheels can cause a spacecraft to lose its ability to maintain position and thus potentially cause a mission failure.\n\nTwo servicing missions to the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] have replaced a reaction wheel.
