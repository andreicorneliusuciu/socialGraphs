Human teams are especially appropriate for conducting tasks that are high in [[complexity]] and have many interdependent subtasks.\n\nA group does not necessarily constitute a team. Teams normally have members with complementary skills and generate synergy through a coordinated effort which allows each member to maximize their strengths and minimize their weaknesses. Naresh Jain (2009) claims: \n\n<blockquote>\nTeam members need to learn how to help one another, help other team members realize their true potential, and create an environment that allows everyone to go beyond his or her limitations. Teams can be broken down into from a huge team or one big group of people, even if these smaller secondary teams are temporary.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Jain\n| first1                = Naresh\n| chapter               = Run marathons, not sprints\n| editor1-last          = Davis\n| editor1-first         = Barbee\n| title                 = 97 Things Every Project Manager Should Know: Collective Wisdom from the Experts\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=SnJFzi7M9XcC\n| publisher             = O'Reilly Media, Inc.\n| publication-date      = 2009\n| page                  = 96 \n| isbn                  = 9781449379568 \n| accessdate            = 2014-05-05\n| quote                 = Team members need to learn how to help one another, help other team members realize their true potential, and create an environment that allows everyone to go beyond their limitations.\n}}\n</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nA team becomes more than just a collection of people when a strong sense of mutual commitment creates synergy, thus generating performance greater than the sum of the performance of its individual members.\n\nThus teams of [[game]] players can form (and re-form) to practise their craft/sport.

This is because a larger group is able to address concerns of the whole [[system]]. So while a large team may be ineffective at performing a given task, Cooperider says that the relevance of that task should be considered, because determining whether the team is effective first requires identifying what needs to be accomplished.\n\n[[File:Bullock wagon Promontory Road.jpg|thumb|A team of [[ox]]en yoked together]]\nRegarding composition, all teams will have an element of homogeneity and heterogeneity.  The more homogeneous the group, the more cohesive it will be. The more heterogeneous the group, the greater the differences in perspective and increased potential for [[creativity]], but also the greater potential for conflict.\n\nTeam members normally have different roles, like team leader and agents. Large teams can divide into subteams according to need.\n\nMany teams go through a life-cycle of stages, identified by [[Bruce Tuckman]] as: [[Forming-storming-norming-performing|forming, storming, norming, performing and adjourning]].\n\n==Types==\nOf particular importance is the [[concept]] of different types of teams.{{cn|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Interdependent and independent===\nOne common distinction is drawn{{by whom?|date=April 2016}} between interdependent and independent teams.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Differences between Work Groups and Teams - For Dummies|url = http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/differences-between-work-groups-and-teams.html|website = www.dummies.com|accessdate = 2015-09-10|quote = Independent-level work groups are the most common form of work groups on the business scene... staff members work on their own assignments with general direction and minimal supervision.

People in those occupations come together in one department because they serve a common overall function, but almost everyone in the group works fairly independently.

In an interdisciplinary team approach, members of the core team will often r\u00f4le-blend, taking on tasks usually filled by people in different roles on the team.<ref name=Ferrell/> A common interdisciplinary team approach popularized by [[IDEO]] is the [[Balanced Team]]. IDEO interprets the balanced team as a composition of three discrete factors: desirability, feasibility, and viability. These three factors are assumed{{by whom?|date=April 2016}} through human/design-oriented resources, technical-oriented resources, and business-oriented resources.<ref>[http://grasshopperherder.com/the-complete-team/ Tristan Kromer (2015) \"The Complete Team\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.ideo.com/about/ IDEO \"Our Approach: Design Thinking\"]</ref>\n\n===Categories by subject===\n\n[[File:Type 91 SAM fire.JPG|thumb|left|A [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]] (JASDF) team looks on after the Type 91 Kai MANPAD fires a rocket at a mock airborne target.]]\n\nAlthough the concept of a team is relatively simple, social scientists have identified many different types of teams. In general, teams either act as information processors, or take on a more active role in the task and actually perform activities. Common categories and subtypes of teams include:\n\n====Executive team====\nAn executive team is a management team that draws up plans for activities and then directs these activities (Devine, 2002). An example of an executive team would be a construction team designing blueprints for a new building, and then guiding the construction of the building using these blueprints.\n\n====Command team====\nThe goal of the command team is to combine instructions and to coordinate action among management. In other words, command teams serve as the \"middle man\" in tasks (Devine, 2002). For instance, messengers on a construction site, conveying instructions from the executive team to the builders, would be an example of a command team.\n\n====Project teams====\n{{Main|Project team}}\nA team used only for a [[define]]d period of time and for a separate, concretely definable purpose, often{{quantify|date=April 2016}} becomes known as a project team. This category of team includes negotiation-, commission- and design-team subtypes. In general, these types of teams are multi-talented and composed of individuals with expertise in many different areas. Members of these teams might belong to different groups, but receive assignment to activities for the same [[project]], thereby allowing outsiders to view them as a single unit. In this way, setting up a team allegedly facilitates the creation, tracking and assignment of a group of people based on the project in hand.{{cn|date=April 2016}}  The use of the \"team\" label in this instance often has no relationship to whether the employees work as a team.\n\n====Advisory teams====\nAdvisory teams make suggestions about a final product (Devine, 2002). For instance, a [[quality control | quality-control]] group on an assembly line would be an example of an advisory team: they may examine the products produced and make suggestions about how to improve the quality of the items being made.\n\n====Work teams====\nWork teams are responsible for the actual act of creating tangible products and services (Devine, 2002). The actual workers on an assembly line would be an example of a production team, whereas waiters and waitresses at a diner would be an example of a service team.\n\n====Action teams====\nAction teams are highly specialized and coordinated teams whose actions are intensely focused on producing a product or service (Devine, 2002). An NFL football team would be an example of an action team. Other examples occur in the military, paramedics, and transportation (e.g., a [[flight crew]] on an airplane).\n\n====Sports teams====\n{{Main|Sports team}}\nA [[sport]]s team is a group of people which play [[sports]] (often [[team sports]]) together.  Members include all players (even those who are waiting their turn to play), as well as support members such as a team manager or [[Coach (sport)|coach]].\n\n====Virtual teams====\n{{Main|Virtual team}}\nDevelopments in [[information and communications technology]] have seen the emergence of the virtual work-team. A virtual team is a group of people who work interdependently and with shared purpose across space, time, and organisational boundaries using technology to communicate and collaborate. Virtual team members can be located across a country or across the world, rarely meet face-to-face, and include members from different cultures.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=634645 Kimble et al. (2000)] Effective Virtual Teams through Communities of Practice (Department of Management Science Research Paper Series, 00/9), University of Strathclyde, Strathclyde, UK, 2000.</ref>\n\nIn their 2009 literature-review paper, Ale Ebrahim, N., Ahmed, S. and Taha, Z. added two key issues to definition of a [[virtual team]]: \"as small temporary groups of geographically, organizationally and/ or time dispersed [[knowledge workers]] who coordinate their work predominantly with electronic information and communication technologies in order to accomplish one or more organization tasks\".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1530904|title= Virtual R& Teams in Small and Medium Enterprises: A Literature Review|work= ssrn.com}}</ref> Many virtual teams are cross-functional and emphasize solving customer problems or generating new work processes.\n\nThe [[United States Department of Labor]] reported that in 2001, 19 million people [[Work from home|worked from home]] online or from another location, and that by the end of 2002, over 100 million people world-wide would work outside traditional offices.<ref>\nPearlson & Saunders, 2001\n</ref>\n\n== Team cognition ==\n\nTeam cognition has been defined as an \u201cemergent state that refers to the manner in which knowledge important to team functioning is organized, represented, and distributed within team.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = DeChurch | first1 = L.A. | last2 = Mesmer-Magnus | first2 = J.R. | year = 2010 | title = The cognitive underpinnings of effective teamwork: a meta-analysis | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 95 | issue = 1| pages = 32\u201353 | doi=10.1037/a0017328}}</ref>  This emergent state can manifest in two ways. Compositional emergence occurs when individual level cognition is similar in form and function to its manifestation at team-level. Compilational emergence, on the other hand, represents a greater degree of synergy among team members and represents a new-team level construct. As such, higher degrees of compilational emergence are more closely related to team process and performance than is compositional emergence.\n\nResearch into team cognition has focused on how teams develop mental models and [[transactive memory]] systems. Mental models refer to the degree in which team members have similar cognitive understanding of the situation and performance goals which include shared representations of the task.  Transactive memory systems relate to how knowledge is distributed among team members and retrieved in a coordinated fashion, the way that team member rely on knowledge that is possessed by other members and how knowledge sets are differentiated within a team.  The emergence of team cognition is thought to impact team effectiveness because it can positively affect a team\u2019s behavioural process, motivational states, and performance.\n\nTeam cognition consists of two broad types of content. Task related models are related to knowledge of the major duties and resources possessed by the team. Team-related models refer to interactions and interdependence among the team members.\n\n==Team effectiveness ==\n{{Main|Team effectiveness}}\nThe formation of teams is most appropriate for tasks that are difficult, complex and important. These types of tasks are often beyond the skills and abilities of any single individual. However, the formation of a team to complete such tasks does not guarantee success. Rather, the proper implementation of teams is positively related to both member satisfaction and increased effectiveness.  Organizations who want to receive the benefits afforded by teams need to carefully consider how teams are built and implemented. Often, teams are created without providing members any training to develop the skills necessary to perform well in a team setting. This is critical, because teamwork can be cognitively and interpersonally demanding.   Even when a team consists of talented individuals, these individuals must learn to coordinate their actions and develop functional interpersonal interactions.<ref name=\"Forsyth, D.

A \"[[sales]] team\" is a common example of this loose or perhaps [[euphemistic]] usage, though inter-dependencies exist in [[organisations]], and a sales group can be let down by poor performance in other parts of the organisation upon which sales depend, like delivery, after-sales service, etc.  However \"sales staff\" is a more accurate description of the typical arrangement.\n\nGroups develop into teams in four stages:<ref>\nWheelan, S. (2010). Creating Effective Teams: a Guide for Members and Leaders. Los Angeles: SAGE.

In the second stage, the group seeks to free itself from its dependence on the leader and groups have conflicts about goals and procedures (identical to 'Storming' in Tuckman's model). In the third stage, the group manages to work through the conflicts (identical to 'Norming' in Tuckman's model). And in the last stage, groups focus on team productivity (identical to 'Performing' in Tuckman's model).{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}\n\nOne aspect of teams that can set them apart from other groups is their level of autonomy. Hackman developed a hierarchical model of team autonomy which consists of four levels of team self-management. It is imagined along a continuum, starting with a manager-led team in which team members complete the required tasks but someone outside the team performs the executive functions.  Next in the hierarchy are [[self-managing team]]s, followed by self-designing teams. Finally, at the top of the hierarchy, come self-governing teams.  The model describes four different types of control that fully self-governing teams can possess. These include control over the execution of the task, monitoring and managing work processes, control over the design and performance of a team, and setting the overall direction of the team.<ref name=\"Forsyth, D.

A working group\u2019s performance is made up of the individual results of all its individual members. A team\u2019s performance is made up of both individual results and collective results. Teams produce work products/results though the joint contributions of team members. This is what makes the team\u2019s collective performance greater than the sum of all individual members\u2019 best performance. In short, a team is more than the sum of its parts.<ref>[http://www.jointeambuilding.com/business-tools-for-success/how-to-tell-the-difference-between-groups-and-teams/ Group vs Team]</ref>\n\n==See also==<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n{{Wiktionary|teem|team}}\n{{Commons category|teams}}\n{{columns-list|2|\n*[[Air-defense experiments]]\n*[[Coalition]]\n*[[Community]]\n*[[Driving (horse)#Teams|Driving (horse)]]\n*[[Forming-storming-norming-performing]]\n*[[Group (sociology)]]\n*[[Groups of people]]\n*[[Judge\u2013advisor system]]\n*[[Multiteam System (MTS)]]\n*[[Player (game)|Player]]\n*[[Super-team]]\n*[[Albert S Humphrey|Team Action Management]]\n*[[Team building]]\n*[[Team composition]]\n*[[Teamwork]]\n*[[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n* Devine, D.
