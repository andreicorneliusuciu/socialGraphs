Copper losses are an undesirable transfer of [[energy]], as are [[core loss]]es, which result from [[induced current]]s in adjacent components. The term is applied regardless of whether the windings are made of [[copper]] or another conductor, such as [[aluminium]]. Hence the term '''winding loss''' is often preferred.  The term [[load loss]] is closely related but not identical, since an unloaded transformer will have some winding loss.\n\n==Calculations==\nCopper losses result from [[Joule heating]] and so are also referred to as \"I squared R losses\", in reference to [[Joule's first law|Joule's First Law]]. This states that the energy lost each [[second]], or [[Power (physics)|power]], increases as the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the current through the windings and in [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]] to the [[electrical resistance]] of the conductors.\n\n:<math>\\mbox{Copper Loss} \\propto I^2 \\cdot R</math>\n\nwhere I is the current flowing in the conductor and R the resistance of the conductor. With I in [[ampere]]s and R in ohms, the calculated power loss is given in [[watt]]s.\n\nJoule heating has a [[coefficient of performance]] of 1.0, meaning that every 1 watt of electrical power is converted to 1 Joule of heat. Therefore, the energy lost due to copper loss is:\n\n:<math>\\mbox{Copper Loss} = I^2 \\cdot R \\cdot t</math>\n\nwhere t is the time in [[second]]s the current is maintained. \n\n==Effect of frequency==\nFor low-frequency applications, the power lost can be minimized by employing conductors with a large cross-sectional area, made from low-[[resistivity]] metals.\n\nWith high-frequency currents, the [[Proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]] and [[skin effect]] cause the current to be unevenly distributed across the conductor, increasing its effective resistance, and making loss calculations more difficult.\n\n[[Litz wire]] is a type of wire constructed to force the current to be distributed uniformly, thereby reducing Joule heating.\n\n==Reducing copper loss==\nAmong other measures, the electrical energy efficiency of a typical industrial [[induction motor]] can be improved by reducing the electrical losses in the [[stator]] windings (e.g., by increasing the cross-sectional area of the conductor, improving the winding technique, and using materials with higher electrical conductivities, such as [[Copper in energy efficient motors|copper]]). \n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.articleworld.org/index.php/Copper_loss Reduction of copper losses]\n\n[[Category:Transformers (electrical)]]\n[[Category:Electrical engineering]]\n\n{{electric-stub}}"}]}}}}
