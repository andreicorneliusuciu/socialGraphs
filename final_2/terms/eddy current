Eddy currents flow in closed loops within conductors, in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field.  They can be induced within nearby stationary conductors by a time-varying magnetic field created by an AC [[electromagnet]] or [[transformer]], for example, or by relative motion between a [[magnet]] and a nearby conductor.  The magnitude of the current in a given loop is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, the area of the loop, and the rate of change of flux, and inversely proportional to the [[resistivity]] of the material.\n\nBy [[Lenz's law]], an eddy current creates a magnetic field that opposes the magnetic field that created it, and thus eddy currents react back on the source of the magnetic field.  For example, a nearby conductive surface will exert a drag force on a moving magnet that opposes its motion, due to eddy currents induced in the surface by the moving magnetic field.  This effect is employed in [[eddy current brake]]s which are used to stop rotating power tools quickly when they are turned off.  The current flowing through the resistance of the conductor also dissipates energy as [[heat]] in the material.  Thus eddy currents are a cause of energy loss in alternating current (AC) [[inductor]]s, [[transformer]]s, [[electric motor]]s and [[electric generator|generators]], and other AC machinery, requiring special construction such as [[laminated core|laminated magnetic cores]] or [[ferrite core]]s to minimize them.  Eddy currents are also used to heat objects in [[induction heating]] furnaces and equipment, and to detect cracks and flaws in metal parts using [[eddy-current testing]] instruments.\n\n==Origin of term==\nThe term ''eddy current'' comes from analogous currents seen in [[water]] in [[fluid dynamics]], causing localised areas of turbulence known as ''[[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]]'' giving rise to persistent vortices. Somewhat analogously, eddy currents can take time to build up and can persist for very short times in conductors due to their inductance.\n\n==History==\nThe first person to observe eddy currents was [[Fran\u00e7ois Arago]] (1786\u20131853), the 25th Prime Minister of France, who was also a mathematician, physicist and astronomer. In 1824 he observed what has been called rotatory magnetism, and that most conductive bodies could be magnetized; these discoveries were completed and explained by [[Michael Faraday]] (1791\u20131867).\n\nIn 1834, [[Heinrich Lenz]] stated [[Lenz's law]], which says that the direction of induced current flow in an object will be such that its magnetic field will oppose the change of magnetic flux that caused the current flow. Eddy currents produce a secondary field that cancels a part of the external field and causes some of the external flux to avoid the conductor.\n\nFrench physicist [[L\u00e9on Foucault]] (1819\u20131868) is credited with having discovered eddy currents. In September, 1855, he discovered that the force required for the rotation of a copper disc becomes greater when it is made to rotate with its rim between the poles of a magnet, the disc at the same time becoming heated by the eddy current induced in the metal. The first use of eddy current for non-destructive testing occurred in 1879 when [[David E. Hughes]] used the principles to conduct metallurgical sorting tests.<ref>[http://ndt-review.blogspot.com/2010/12/eddy-current-method-short-research.html Short research about the history of eddy current]</ref>\n\n==Explanation==\n[[Image:Eddy currents due to magnet.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Eddy currents ''(<span style=\"color:red;\">I, red</span>)'' induced in a conductive metal plate ''(C)'' as it moves to right under a magnet ''(N)''.  The magnetic field ''(<span style=\"color:green;\">B, green</span>)'' is directed down through the plate.  The increasing field at the leading edge of the magnet ''(left)'' induces a counterclockwise current, which by [[Lenz's law]] creates its own magnetic field ''(<span style=\"color:blue;\">left blue arrow</span>)'' directed up, which opposes the magnet's field, producing a retarding force.  Similarly, at the trailing edge of the magnet ''(right)'', a clockwise current and downward counterfield is created ''(<span style=\"color:blue;\">right blue arrow</span>)'' also producing a retarding force.]]\n[[File:Eddy current brake diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Eddy current brake.]]\n\nA magnet induces circular currents in a metal sheet moving past it.  See the diagram at right.  It shows a metal sheet ''(C)'' moving to the right under a stationary magnet.  The magnetic field ''(<span style=\"color:green;\">B, green arrows</span>)'' of the magnet's north pole ''N'' passes down through the sheet.  Since the metal is moving, the [[magnetic flux]] through the sheet is changing.  At the part of the sheet under the leading edge of the magnet ''(left side)'' the magnetic field through the sheet is increasing as it gets nearer the magnet, <math> {dB \\over dt}\\;>\\;0</math>.  From [[Faraday's law of induction]], this creates a circular [[electric field]] in the sheet in a counterclockwise direction around the magnetic field lines.  This field induces a counterclockwise flow of electric current ''(<span style=\"color:red;\">I, red</span>)'', in the sheet.  This is the eddy current.  At the trailing edge of the magnet ''(right side)'' the magnetic field through the sheet is decreasing, <math> {dB \\over dt}\\;<\\;0</math>, inducing a second eddy current in a clockwise direction in the sheet.\n\nAnother way to understand the current is to see that the free [[charge carrier]]s ([[electron]]s) in the metal sheet are moving with the sheet to the right, so the magnetic field exerts a sideways force on them due to the [[Lorentz force]],     Since the velocity '''''v''''' of the charges is to the right and the magnetic field '''''B''''' is directed down, from the [[right hand rule]] the Lorentz force on positive charges '''''F''''' = ''q''('''''v'''''&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;'''''B''''') is toward the rear (to the left when facing in the direction of motion '''''v''''').  This causes a current ''I'' toward the rear under the magnet, which circles around through parts of the sheet outside the magnetic field, clockwise to the right and counterclockwise to the left, to the front of the magnet again.  The mobile [[charge carrier]]s in the metal, the [[electron]]s, actually have a negative charge (''q'' < 0) so their motion is opposite in direction to the [[conventional current]] shown.\n\nDue to [[Ampere's circuital law]] each of these circular currents  creates a counter magnetic field  (''<span style=\"color:blue;\">blue arrows</span>''), which due to [[Lenz's law]] opposes the change in magnetic field which caused it, exerting a drag force on the sheet.  At the leading edge of the magnet ''(left side)'' by the [[right hand rule]] the counterclockwise current creates a magnetic field pointed up, opposing the magnet's field, causing a repulsive force between the sheet and the leading edge of the magnet.  In contrast, at the trailing edge ''(right side)'', the clockwise current causes a magnetic field pointed down, in the same direction as the magnet's field, creating an attractive force between the sheet and the trailing edge of the magnet.  Both of these forces oppose the motion of the sheet.   The [[kinetic energy]] which is consumed overcoming this drag force is dissipated as heat by the currents flowing through the [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of the metal, so the metal gets warm under the magnet.\n\n==Properties==\nEddy currents in conductors of non-zero [[resistivity]] generate heat as well as electromagnetic forces. The heat can be used for [[induction heating]]. The electromagnetic forces can be used for levitation, creating movement, or to give a strong [[Eddy current brake|braking]] effect. Eddy currents can also have undesirable effects, for instance power loss in [[transformer]]s. In this application, they are minimized with thin plates, by [[Electrical steel#Lamination coatings|lamination]] of conductors or other details of conductor shape.\n\nSelf-induced eddy currents are responsible for the [[skin effect]] in conductors.<ref>Israel D. Vagner, B.I. Lembrikov, Peter Rudolf Wyder, Electrodynamics of Magnetoactive Media, Springer, 2003,  ISBN 3540436944, page 73, Retrieved online on 7 January 2014 at https://books.google.com/books?id=E8caSplsF28C&pg=PA73</ref> The latter can be used for non-destructive testing of materials for geometry features, like micro-cracks.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvscLzOlkNgC&pg=PA570</ref> A similar effect is the [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]], which is caused by externally induced eddy currents.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=mMJxcWqm_1oC&pg=PA80</ref>\n\nAn object or part of an object experiences steady field intensity and direction where there is still relative motion of the field and the object (for example in the center of the field in the diagram), or unsteady fields where the currents cannot circulate due to the geometry of the conductor. In these situations charges collect on or within the object and these charges then produce static electric potentials that oppose any further current. Currents may be initially associated with the creation of static potentials, but these may be transitory and small.\n\n[[File:Laminated core eddy currents 2.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|''(left)'' Eddy currents ''(<span style=\"color:red;\">I, red</span>)'' within a solid iron transformer core. ''(right)'' Making the core out of thin [[laminations]] parallel to the field ''(<span style=\"color:green;\">B, green</span>)'' with insulation between them reduces the eddy currents. Although the field and currents are shown in one direction, they actually reverse direction with the alternating current in the transformer winding.]]\n\nEddy currents generate resistive losses that transform some forms of energy, such as kinetic energy, into heat.  This [[Joule heating]] reduces efficiency of iron-core [[transformer]]s and [[electric motors]] and other devices that use changing magnetic fields.  Eddy currents are minimized in these devices by selecting [[magnetic core]] materials that have low electrical conductivity (e.g., [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrites]]) or by using thin sheets of magnetic material, known as [[laminations]]. Electrons cannot cross the insulating gap between the laminations and so are unable to circulate on wide arcs. Charges gather at the lamination boundaries, in a process analogous to the [[Hall effect]], producing electric fields that oppose any further accumulation of charge and hence suppressing the eddy currents. The shorter the distance between adjacent laminations (i.e., the greater the number of laminations per unit area, perpendicular to the applied field), the greater the suppression of eddy currents.\n\nThe conversion of input energy to heat is not always undesirable, however, as there are some practical applications. One is in the brakes of some trains known as [[eddy current brake]]s.  During braking, the metal wheels are exposed to a magnetic field from an electromagnet, generating eddy currents in the wheels.  This eddy current is formed by the movement of the wheels. So, by Lenz's law, the magnetic field formed by the Eddy current will oppose its cause. Thus the wheel will face a force opposing the initial movement of the wheel.  The faster the wheels are spinning, the stronger the effect, meaning that as the train slows the braking force is reduced, producing a smooth stopping motion.\n\n[[Induction heating]] makes use of eddy currents to provide heating of metal objects.\n\n===Power dissipation of eddy currents===\nUnder certain assumptions (uniform material, uniform magnetic field, no [[skin effect]], etc.) the power lost due to eddy currents per unit mass for a thin sheet or wire can be calculated from the following equation:<ref>F. Fiorillo, Measurement and characterization of magnetic materials, Elsevier Academic Press, 2004, ISBN 0-12-257251-3, page. 31</ref>\n\n:<math>P = \\frac{\\pi^2 B_\\text{p}^{\\,2} d^2 f^2 }{6k \\rho D},</math>\n\nwhere\n: ''P'' is the power lost per unit mass (W/kg),\n: ''B''<sub>p</sub> is the peak magnetic field (T),\n: ''d'' is the thickness of the sheet or diameter of the wire (m),\n: ''f'' is the frequency (Hz),\n: ''k'' is a constant equal to 1 for a thin sheet and 2 for a thin wire,\n: \u03c1 is the [[resistivity]] of the material (\u03a9&nbsp;m), and\n: ''D'' is the [[density]] of the material (kg/m<sup>3</sup>).\n\nThis equation is valid only under the so-called quasi-static conditions, where the frequency of magnetisation does not result in the [[skin effect]]; that is, the electromagnetic wave fully penetrates the material.\n\n=== Skin effect ===\n{{main article|Skin effect}}\nIn very fast-changing fields, the magnetic field does not penetrate completely into the interior of the material. This ''skin effect'' renders the above equation invalid. However, in any case increased frequency of the same value of field will always increase eddy currents, even with non-uniform field penetration.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nThe penetration depth for a good conductor can be calculated from the following equation:<ref>{{cite book|last=Wangsness|first=Roald|title=Electromagnetic Fields|edition=2nd|pages=387\u20138}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\delta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi f \\mu \\sigma}},</math>\n\nwhere \u03b4 is the penetration depth (m), ''f'' is the frequency (Hz), \u03bc is the [[magnetic permeability]] of the material (H/m), and \u03c3 is the [[electrical conductivity]] of the material (S/m).\n\n===Diffusion equation===\nThe derivation of a useful equation for modelling the effect of eddy currents in a material starts with the differential, magnetostatic form of [[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law|Amp\u00e8re's Law]],<ref name=\"bertotti\">G.

As soon as a sufficiently strong magnetic field has been switched on, the pendulum is stopped on entering the field.\n<small>Performed by Prof. Oliver Zajkov at the Physics Institute at the {{w|Ss. Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje}}, Macedonia.</small>]]\n\n[[Eddy current brake]]s use the drag force created by eddy currents as a [[brake (technology)|brake]] to slow or stop moving objects.  Since there is no contact with a brake shoe or drum, there is no mechanical wear.  However, an eddy current brake cannot provide a \"holding\" torque and so may be used in combination with mechanical brakes, for example, on overhead cranes. Another application is on some roller coasters, where heavy [[copper]] plates extending from the car are moved between pairs of very strong permanent magnets. [[Electrical resistance]] within the plates causes a dragging effect analogous to friction, which dissipates the kinetic energy of the car.  The same technique is used in electromagnetic brakes in railroad cars and to quickly stop the blades in power tools such as circular saws. Using electromagnets, as opposed to permanent magnets, the strength of the magnetic field can be adjusted and so the magnitude of braking effect changed.\n\n===Repulsive effects and levitation===\n{{main article|electrodynamic suspension}}\n[[File:Linear motor field.gif|thumb|A cross section through a linear motor placed above a thick aluminium slab. As the [[linear induction motor]]'s field pattern sweeps to the left, eddy currents are left behind in the metal and this causes the field lines to lean.]]\nIn a varying magnetic field the induced currents exhibit diamagnetic-like repulsion effects. A conductive object will experience a repulsion force. This can lift objects against gravity, though with continual power input to replace the energy dissipated by the eddy currents. An example application is separation of [[aluminum can]]s from other metals in an [[eddy current separator]].  Ferrous metals cling to the magnet, and aluminum (and other non-ferrous conductors) are forced away from the magnet; this can separate a waste stream into ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal.\n\nWith a very strong handheld magnet, such as those made from [[neodymium]], one can easily observe a very similar effect by rapidly sweeping the magnet over a coin with only a small separation.  Depending on the strength of the magnet, identity of the coin, and separation between the magnet and coin, one may induce the coin to be pushed slightly ahead of the magnet \u2013 even if the coin contains no magnetic elements, such as the US [[Penny (United States coin)|penny]]. Another example involves dropping a strong magnet down a tube of copper<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrw-i5Ku0mI</ref> \u2013 the magnet falls at a dramatically slow pace.\n\nIn a perfect conductor with no [[electrical resistance|resistance]] (a [[superconductor]]), surface eddy currents exactly cancel the field inside the conductor, so no magnetic field penetrates the conductor.  Since no energy is lost in resistance, eddy currents created when a magnet is brought near the conductor persist even after the magnet is stationary, and can exactly balance the force of gravity, allowing [[magnetic levitation]].  Superconductors also exhibit a separate inherently [[quantum mechanical]] phenomenon called the [[Meissner effect]] in which any magnetic field lines present in the material when it becomes superconducting are expelled, thus the magnetic field in a superconductor is always zero.\n\nUsing [[electromagnet]]s with electronic switching comparable to [[electronic speed control]] it is possible to generate electromagnetic fields moving in an arbitrary direction.  As described in the section above about eddy current brakes, a non-ferromagnetic conductor surface tends to rest within this moving field. When however this field is moving, a vehicle can be levitated and propulsed. This is comparable to a [[maglev]] but is not bound to a rail.<ref>[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/142464853/hendo-hoverboards-worlds-first-real-hoverboard Hendo Hoverboards - World's first REAL hoverboard]</ref>\n\n===Identification of metals===\nIn coin-operated [[vending machine]], eddy currents are used to detect counterfeit coins, or [[slug (coin)|slug]]s.  The coin rolls past a stationary magnet, and eddy currents slow its speed.  The strength of the eddy currents, and thus the retardation, depends on the conductivity of the coin's metal.  Slugs are slowed to a different degree than genuine coins, and this is used to send them into the rejection slot.\n\n===Vibration and position sensing===\nEddy currents are used in certain types of [[proximity sensors]] to observe the vibration and position of rotating shafts within their bearings.  This technology was originally pioneered in the 1930s by researchers at [[General Electric]] using vacuum tube circuitry.  In the late 1950s, solid-state versions were developed by [[Donald E. Bently]] at [[Bently Nevada]] Corporation.  These sensors are extremely sensitive to very small displacements making them well suited to observe the minute vibrations (on the order of several thousandths of an inch) in modern [[turbomachinery]].  A typical proximity sensor used for vibration monitoring has a scale factor of 200 mV/mil.  Widespread use of such sensors in turbomachinery has led to development of industry standards that prescribe their use and application.  Examples of such standards are [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API) Standard 670 and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 7919.\n\nA Ferraris acceleration sensor, also called a [[Ferraris sensor]], is a contactless sensor that uses eddy currents to measure relative acceleration.<ref>\nBernhard Hiller.\n[http://www.baumerhuebner.com/pdf/ferraris_acceleration_sensor.pdf \"Ferraris Acceleration Sensor - Principle and Field of Application in Servo Drives\"].\n</ref><ref>\nJian Wang, Paul Vanherck, Jan Swevers, Hendrik Van Brussel.\n[http://people.mech.kuleuven.be/~jwang/paper/ferraris_speed.pdf \"Speed Observer Based on Sensor Fusion Combining Ferraris Sensor and Linear Position Encoder Signals\"].\n</ref><ref>\nJ.

This effect limits the [[flux linkage]] in [[inductor]]s and [[transformer]]s having [[magnetic core]]s.\n\n===Other applications===\n*Rock Climbing Auto Belays<ref>{{cite web|title=TRUBLUE Auto Belay|url=http://headrushtech.com/trublue-auto-belay/|website=Head Rush Technologies|publisher=Head Rush Technologies|accessdate=8 March 2016}}</ref>\n*Zip Line Brakes<ref>{{cite web|title=zipSTOP Zip Line Brake System|url=http://headrushtech.com/zipstop-zip-line-brake|website=Head Rush Technologies|publisher=Head Rush Technologies|accessdate=8 March 2016}}</ref>\n*Free Fall Devices<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Patented Technology|url=http://headrushtech.com/about/technology.html|website=Head Rush Technologies|publisher=Head Rush Technologies|accessdate=8 March 2016}}</ref>\n*[[Metal detector]]s\n*Conductivity meters for non-magnetic metals<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://zappitec.com/?p=p&l=e|title=Zappi - Eddy Current Conductivity Meter - Products|website=zappitec.com|access-date=2016-05-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foerstergroup.de/SIGMATEST.171+M5c50842c46a.0.html|title=Institut Dr. Foerster: SIGMATEST|website=www.foerstergroup.de|access-date=2016-05-08}}</ref>\n*[[Adjustable-speed drive#Eddy current drives|Eddy current adjustable-speed drives]]\n*[[Eddy-current testing]]\n*[[Electricity meter|Electric meters]] (Electromechanical Induction Meters)\n*[[Induction heating]]\n*[[Proximity sensor]] (Displacement sensors)\n*[[Vending machine]]s (detection of coins)\n*Coating Thickness Measurements<ref>[http://www.fischer-technology.com/en/us/coating-thickness/electromagnetic-methods Coating Thickness Measurement with Electromagnetic Methods ]</ref>\n*Sheet Resistance Measurement<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nagy-instruments.de/ohm_sq___od1.html|title=Ohm/sq & OD|website=www.nagy-instruments.de|access-date=2016-05-08}}</ref>\n*[[Eddy current separator]] for metal separation<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cogelme.com/eng/e-eddy-current-metal-separator.htm|title=Eddy Current Separator for metal separation|website=www.cogelme.com|access-date=2016-05-08}}</ref>\n*Mechanical [[speedometer]]s\n*Safety Hazard and defect detection applications\n\n==References==\n;Inline citations\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;General references\n* {{Cite book| first=A.
