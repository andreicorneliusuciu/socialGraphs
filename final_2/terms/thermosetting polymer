A cured thermosetting resin is called a '''thermoset''' or a '''thermosetting plastic/ polymer'''.\n\n==Process==\nThe curing process transforms the resin into a [[plastic]] or [[rubber]] by [[cross-link]]ing individual chains of the polymer.  The cross-linking is facilitated by energy and [[catalyst]]s at chemically active sites, which may be unsaturated sites or epoxy sites, for example, linking into a rigid, [[Dimension|three-dimensional]] structure. This yields molecules with a large molecular weight, resulting in a material that usually decomposes before melting. Therefore, a thermoset cannot be [[melting|melted]] and re-shaped after it is cured. This implies that thermosets cannot be recycled for the same purpose, except as filler material.<ref>The Open University (UK), 2000. T838 ''Design and Manufacture with Polymers: Introduction to Polymers'', page 9. Milton Keynes: The Open University</ref>\n\nSome methods of molding thermosets are:\n* Reactive [[injection moulding]] (used for objects such as milk bottle crates)\n* [[Extrusion molding]] (used for making pipes, threads of fabric and insulation for electrical cables)\n* [[Compression molding]] (used to shape most thermosetting plastics)\n* [[Spin casting]] (used for producing [[fishing lure]]s and [[jig (fishing)|jigs]], [[Miniature figure (gaming)|gaming miniatures]], [[figurine]]s, emblems as well as production and replacement parts)\n\n==Properties==\nThermosetting plastics are generally stronger than [[thermoplastic]] materials due to the three-dimensional network of bonds (cross-linking), and are also better suited to high-[[temperature]] applications up to the decomposition temperature. However, they are more brittle.\n\n==Examples==\n* Polyester fiberglass systems: sheet molding compounds and bulk molding compounds\n* [[Polyurethane]]s: insulating foams, mattresses, coatings, adhesives, car parts, print rollers, shoe soles, flooring, synthetic fibers, etc. Polyurethane polymers are formed by combining two bi- or higher functional monomers/oligomers. This common type of thermoset material has also recently shown to have transient properties and can thus be reprocessed or recycled.<ref name=\"Mechanically Activated, Catalyst-Free Polyhydroxyurethane Vitrimers\">{{cite journal  | last = Fortman  | first = David J.  | authorlink =  |author2=Jacob P.
