This band of frequencies is also known as the '''centimetre band''' or '''centimetre wave''' as the [[wavelength]]s range from one to ten centimetres.  These frequencies fall within the [[microwave]] band, so radio waves with these frequencies are called microwaves.  The small wavelength of microwaves allows them to be directed in narrow beams by aperture antennas such as [[Parabolic antenna|parabolic dish]]es, so they are used for [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] communication and data links<ref name=\"Freedman\">{{cite journal |last=Freedman |first=S. |title=Two-way radio for everyone |journal=Radio News |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=25\u201327 |publisher=Ziff-Davis Publications |location=New York |date=September 1946 |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Radio-News/40s/Radio-News-1946-09.pdf |issn= |doi= |id= |accessdate=March 24, 2014}} This article from the beginning of the microwave era predicted the future value of microwaves for point-to-point communication.</ref> and for [[radar]].  This frequency range is used for most [[radar]] transmitters, [[microwave oven]]s, [[wireless LAN]]s, [[cell phone]]s, [[satellite communication]], [[microwave radio relay]] links, and numerous short range terrestrial data links.  [[Wireless USB]] technology is anticipated to use approximately one-third of this spectrum.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nFrequencies in the SHF range are often referred to by their [[Radio band#IEEE US|IEEE radar band]] designations: [[S band|S]], [[C band (IEEE)|C]], [[X band|X]], [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>]], [[K band (IEEE)|K]], or [[Ka band|K<sub>a</sub> band]], or by similar NATO or EU designations.\n\n==Propagation==\n[[Image:Parabolic antennas.JPG|thumb|upright=1.6|A variety of [[parabolic antenna]]s on a communications tower in Australia for [[point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] microwave communication links.  Some have white plastic [[radome]]s over their apertures to protect against rain. ]]\n[[File:ASR-9 Radar Antenna.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Rotating [[airport surveillance radar]] antenna, which sweeps a vertical fan-shaped beam of microwaves around the airspace surrounding the airport to detect aircraft.]]\n\nMicrowaves propagate entirely by [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]]; [[groundwave]] and [[skywave]] (\"skip\") propagation do not occur.  Although in some cases they can penetrate building walls enough for useful reception, unobstructed rights of way cleared to the first [[Fresnel zone]] are usually required.  Wavelengths are small enough that they can be focused into narrow beams by [[parabolic antenna|parabolic]] and [[horn antenna]]s from a half meter to five meters in diameter.  Therefore, they are used in [[point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] terrestrial communications links limited by the visual horizon (about 40 miles).  Such [[high gain antenna]]s allow [[frequency reuse]] by nearby transmitters.  The size of SHF waves allow large reflections from metal objects the size of automobiles, aircraft, and ships, and other vehicles.  Thus, the narrow [[beamwidth]]s possible with high gain antennas and the low atmospheric attenuation as compared with higher frequencies make SHF the main frequencies used in [[radar]].  Attenuation and scattering by moisture in the atmosphere is a factor at the high end of the band.\n\nAlthough they are not reflected by the [[ionosphere]], small amounts of microwave energy are randomly scattered by water vapor molecules in the [[troposphere]].  This is used in [[troposcatter]] communications systems, operating at a few GHz, to communicate beyond the horizon.  A powerful microwave beam is aimed just above the horizon; as it passes through the [[tropopause]] some of the microwaves are scattered back to Earth to a receiver beyond the horizon.  Distances of 300&nbsp;km can be achieved.  These are mainly used for military communication.\n\n==Antennas==\n[[Image:Diplexer1.jpg|thumb|Microwaves are better carried by  [[waveguide]] than by ordinary RF cables, such as this example from an air traffic control radar]]\n\nWavelengths are small enough at microwave frequencies that the antenna can be much larger than a wavelength, allowing highly [[directional antenna|directional]] (high gain) antennas to be built.   Directive antennas at SHF frequencies are mostly [[aperture (antenna)|aperture antennas]], such as [[parabolic antenna]]s (the most common type), [[dielectric lens]], [[slot antenna|slot]] and [[horn antenna]]s.  Large parabolic antennas can produce very narrow beams of a few degrees or less, and often must be aimed with the aid of a [[Antenna boresight|boresight]].   For [[omnidirectional antenna|omnidirectional]] applications like wireless devices and [[cellphone]]s, small [[dipole antenna|dipoles]] or [[monopole antenna|monopoles]] are used.  The [[patch antenna]] is another type, often integrated into the skin of aircraft.    Another type of antenna practical at microwave frequencies is the [[phased array]], consisting of many dipoles or [[patch antenna]]s on a flat surface, each fed through a [[phase shifter]], which allows the array's beam to be steered electronically.    The short wavelength requires great mechanical rigidity in large antennas, to ensure that the radio waves arrive at the feed point in phase.\n\nTo transport microwaves between antenna and transmitter or receiver, [[waveguide]] (metal pipe) must be used, since at these frequencies other types of [[transmission line]] such as [[coaxial cable]] have unacceptably high losses.  Because of the high cost and maintenance requirements of long waveguide runs, in many microwave antennas the output stage of the transmitter or the [[RF front end]] of the receiver is located at the antenna.\n\n==Utilization==\nSHF frequencies occupy a \"sweet spot\" in the radio spectrum which is currently being exploited by many new radio services.  They are the lowest frequency band where radio waves can be directed in narrow beams by conveniently sized antennas so they do not interfere with nearby transmitters on the same frequency, allowing frequency reuse.  On the other hand, they are the highest frequencies which can be used for long distance terrestrial communication; higher frequencies in the [[Extremely high frequency|EHF]] (millimeter wave) band are highly absorbed by the atmosphere, limiting practical propagation distances to one kilometer.  The large bandwidth gives the band a very large information-carrying capacity.  In recent decades many new solid state sources of microwave energy have been developed, and microwave [[integrated circuit]]s for the first time allow significant [[signal processing]] to be done at these frequencies.  Sources of EHF energy are much more limited and in an earlier state of development.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Knife-edge effect]]\n*[[Microwave]]\n*[[Microwave burn]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* Tomislav Stimac, \"''[http://www.vlf.it/frequency/bands.html Definition of frequency bands (VLF, ELF... etc.)]''\".
