For any point experiencing a current, if the number of charged particles passing through it&nbsp;&mdash; or the charge on the particles passing through it&nbsp;&mdash; is increased, the amperes of current at that point will proportionately increase.\n\nThe ampere should not be confused with the [[coulomb]] (also called \"ampere-second\") or the [[ampere hour]] (A\u22c5h). The ampere is a unit of current, the amount of charge transiting per unit time, and the coulomb is a unit of [[electric charge|charge]]. When [[International System of Units|SI units]] are used, constant, instantaneous and average current are expressed in amperes (as in \"the charging current is 1.2&nbsp;A\") and the charge accumulated, or passed through a circuit over a period of time is expressed in coulombs (as in \"the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] charge is {{val|30000|u=C}}\"). The relation of the ampere (C/s) to the coulomb is the same as that of the [[watt]] (J/s) to the [[joule]].\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Ampere-def-en.svg|thumb|Illustration of the definition of the ampere unit]]\n[[Amp\u00e8re's force law]]<ref name=Serway>{{cite book\n| first1 =Raymond A | last1 = Serway | last2 = Jewett | first2 = JW\n|title=Serway's principles of physics: a calculus based text\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DZz341Pp50C&pg=RA1-PA746&dq=wire+%22magnetic+force%22&lr=&as_brr=0&sig=4vMV_CH6Nm8ZkgjtDJFlupekYoA#PRA1-PA746,M1 |publisher=Thompson Brooks/Cole\n|edition=Fourth\n|location=Belmont, CA\n|year=2006\n|page=746\n|isbn = 0-53449143-X}}</ref><ref name = \"Beyond\">{{Citation | url = http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/newsfromnist_beyond_the_kilogram.htm | title = Beyond the Kilogram: Redefining the International System of Units | year = 2006 | publisher = [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] | place = USA | accessdate = March 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080321221139/http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/newsfromnist_beyond_the_kilogram.htm| archivedate= 21 March 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}.</ref> states that there is an attractive or repulsive force between two parallel wires carrying an electric current.

({{val|6.2415093|e=18}} is the reciprocal of the value of the elementary charges in coulombs.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?e | publisher = NIST | place = USA | title = Physics | contribution = Value}}.</ref>) The proposed change would define 1&nbsp;A as being the current in the direction of flow of a particular number of elementary charges per second. In 2005, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) agreed to study the proposed change. The [[New SI definitions|new definition]] was discussed at the 25th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) in 2014 but for the time being was not adopted.\n\n== Everyday examples ==\n{{main|Orders of magnitude (current)}}\nThe current drawn by typical constant-voltage energy distribution systems is usually dictated by the power ([[watt]]) consumed by the system and the operating voltage. For this reason the examples given below are grouped by voltage level.\n\n=== Portable devices ===\n*Hearing aid (typically 1&nbsp;mW at 1.4&nbsp;V): 0.7&nbsp;mA\n*USB Charging cable (typically (10.5 watts at 5.0 Volts )): 2.1 amperes\n\n=== Internal combustion engine vehicles \u2013 12 V DC ===\nA typical motor vehicle has a 12&nbsp;V battery. The various accessories that are powered by the battery might include:\n*Instrument panel light (typically 2&nbsp;W): 166&nbsp;mA.\n*Headlights (typically 60&nbsp;W): 5&nbsp;A each.\n*Starter motor (typically 1\u20132&nbsp;kW): 80\u2013160&nbsp;A\n\n=== North American domestic supply \u2013 120 V AC ===\nMost  Canada, Mexico and United States domestic power suppliers run at 120&nbsp;V.\n\nHousehold [[circuit breaker]]s typically provide a maximum of 15&nbsp;A or 20&nbsp;A of current to a given set of outlets.\n*22-inch/56-centimeter portable television (35&nbsp;W): 290&nbsp;mA\n*Tungsten light bulb (60\u2013100&nbsp;W): 500\u2013830&nbsp;mA\n*Toaster, kettle (1.5&nbsp;kW): 12.5&nbsp;A\n*Hair dryer (1.8&nbsp;kW): 15&nbsp;A\n*USB Cell Phone charger (typically 10 watts input): 83mA\n\n=== European & Commonwealth domestic supply \u2013 230-240 V AC ===\nMost European domestic power supplies run at 230&nbsp;V, and most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] domestic power supplies run at 240&nbsp;V. For the same amount of power (in watts), the current drawn by a particular European or Commonwealth appliance (in Europe or a Commonwealth country) will be less than for an equivalent North American appliance.<ref group=\"Note\">The formula for power is given by\n:<math>\nP(t) = I(t) \\cdot V(t) \\,\n</math>\nso it follows that if the voltage is doubled and the power remains the same, the current will be halved.</ref> Typical circuit breakers will provide 16&nbsp;A.\n\nThe current drawn by a number of typical appliances are:\n*22-inch/56-centimeter portable television (35&nbsp;W): 145\u2013150&nbsp;mA\n*Tungsten light bulb (60\u2013100&nbsp;W): 240\u2013450&nbsp;mA\n*Compact fluorescent lamp (11\u201330&nbsp;W): 56\u2013112&nbsp;mA\n*Toaster, kettle (2&nbsp;kW): 9&nbsp;A\n*Immersion heater (4.6&nbsp;kW): 19\u201320&nbsp;A\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ammeter]]\n* [[Ampacity]] (current-carrying capacity)\n* [[Electric current]]\n* [[Electric shock]]\n* [[Hydraulic analogy]]\n* [[Magnetic constant]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude (current)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist | group = \"Note\"}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/ The NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty]\n* [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/ampere.html NIST ''Definition of ampere and \u03bc<sub>0</sub>'']\n* [http://afrotechmods.com/tutorials/2011/11/29/basic-electricity-amps/ Tutorial video explaining amperes and current]\n{{SI units}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n\n[[Category:SI base units]]\n[[Category:Units of electric current]]"}]}}}}
