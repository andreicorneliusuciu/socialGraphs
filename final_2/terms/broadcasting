Before this, all forms of electronic communication (early [[radio]], [[telephone]], and [[telegraph]]) were [[:wikt:one-to-one|one-to-one]], with the message intended for a single recipient.

The receiving parties may include the general public or a relatively small subset; the point is that anyone with the appropriate receiving technology and equipment (e.g., a radio or television set) can receive the signal. The field of broadcasting includes both government-managed services such as [[public radio]], [[community radio]] and [[public television]], and private [[commercial radio]] and [[commercial television]]. The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, title 47, part 97 defines \"broadcasting\" as \"transmissions intended for reception by the general public, either direct or relayed\".<ref>{{citation|title=eCFR: Electronic Code of Federal Regulations|publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office (GPO)|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=1b85d8123aea3e34e856a3743ebf9501&mc=true&n=pt47.5.97&r=PART&ty=HTML#se47.5.97_13}}</ref>  Private or two-way [[telecommunication]]s transmissions do not qualify under this definition. For example, [[amateur radio|amateur]] (\"ham\") and [[citizens band radio|citizens band]] (CB) radio operators are not allowed to broadcast. As defined, \"transmitting\" and \"broadcasting\" are '''not''' the same.\n\nTransmission of radio and television programs from a radio or television station to home receivers by [[radio wave]]s is referred to as \"over the air\" (OTA) or [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial]] broadcasting and in most countries requires a [[broadcast license|broadcasting license]].  Transmissions using a wire or cable, like [[cable television]] (which also retransmits OTA stations with their [[retransmission consent|consent]]), are also considered broadcasts, but do not necessarily require a license (though in some countries, a license is required).  In the 2000s, transmissions of television and radio programs via [[Streaming media|streaming]] digital technology have increasingly been referred to as broadcasting as well, though strictly speaking this is incorrect.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of broadcasting}}\n<!-- Please maintain section synchronized with main article; see [[Wikipedia:SYNC]] for guidelines. -->\nThe earliest broadcasting consisted of sending telegraph signals over the airwaves, using [[Morse code]], a system developed in the 1830s by [[Samuel F. B. Morse]], [[physicist]] [[Joseph Henry]] and [[Alfred Vail]]. They developed an [[electrical telegraph]] system which sent pulses of [[electric current]] along wires which controlled an [[electromagnet]] that was located at the receiving end of the telegraph system. A code was needed to transmit natural language using only these pulses, and the silence between them. Morse therefore developed the forerunner to modern [[International Morse code]]. This was particularly important for ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communication, but it became increasingly important for business and general news reporting, and as an arena for personal communication by radio amateurs (Douglas, op. cit.).  Audio broadcasting began experimentally in the first decade of the 20th century.  By the early 1920s radio broadcasting became a household medium, at first on the [[AM band]] and later on [[FM band|FM.]]  Television broadcasting started experimentally in the 1920s and became widespread after World War II, using [[VHF]] and [[UHF]] spectrum. [[Satellite broadcasting]] was initiated in the 1960s and moved into general industry usage in the 1970s, with DBS (Direct Broadcast Satellites) emerging in the 1980s.\n\nOriginally all broadcasting was composed of [[analog signal]]s using [[analog transmission]] techniques but in the 2000s, broadcasters have [[Digital switchover|switched]] to [[Digital signal (broadcasting)|digital signal]]s using [[digital transmission]].  In general usage, broadcasting most frequently refers to the transmission of information and entertainment programming from various sources to the general public.\n\n* [[Analog audio]] vs. [[HD Radio]]\n* [[Analog television]] vs. [[Digital television]]\n* [[Wireless]]\n\nThe world's technological capacity to receive information through one-way broadcast networks more than quadrupled during the two decades from 1986 to 2007, from 432 [[exabytes]] of (optimally compressed) information, to 1.9 [[zettabytes]].<ref name=\"HilbertLopez2011\">[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 \"The World's Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information\"], Martin Hilbert and Priscila L\u00f3pez (2011), [[Science (journal)]], 332(6025), 60-65; free access to the article through here: martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html</ref> This is the information equivalent of 55 newspapers per person per day in 1986, and 175 newspapers per person per day by 2007.<ref name=\"Hilbertvideo2011\">{{cite web|url=http://ideas.economist.com/video/giant-sifting-sound-0 |title=video animation on The World's Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information from 1986 to 2010 |publisher=Ideas.economist.com |date= |accessdate=26 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Methods==\nHistorically, there have been several methods used for broadcasting [[electronic media]] audio and/or video to the general public:\n\n* [[Telephone]] broadcasting (1881\u20131932): the earliest form of electronic broadcasting (not counting data services offered by stock [[Electrical telegraph|telegraph companies]] from 1867, if [[ticker tape|ticker-tape]]s are excluded from the definition). Telephone broadcasting began with the advent of [[Th\u00e9\u00e2trophone]] (\"Theatre Phone\") systems, which were telephone-based distribution systems allowing subscribers to listen to live [[opera]] and [[theatre]] performances over telephone lines, created by French inventor [[Cl\u00e9ment Ader]] in 1881. Telephone broadcasting also grew to include [[telephone newspaper]] services for news and entertainment [[Radio programming|programming]] which were introduced in the 1890s, primarily located in large [[Europe]]an cities. These telephone-based [[Subscription business model|subscription services]] were the first examples of electrical/electronic broadcasting and offered a wide variety of programming.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n* [[Radio broadcasting]] (experimentally from 1906, commercially from 1920); [[sound|audio]] signals sent through the air as [[radio waves]] from a [[transmitter]], picked up by an [[radio antenna|antenna]] and sent to a [[tuner (radio)|receiver]]. [[Radio stations]] can be linked in [[radio network]]s to broadcast common [[radio program]]s, either in [[broadcast syndication]], [[simulcast]] or [[subchannel]]s.\n* [[Television]] broadcasting (telecast), experimentally from 1925, [[commercial television|commercially]] from the 1930s: an extension of radio to include [[video]] signals.\n* [[Cable radio]] (also called \"cable FM\", from 1928) and [[cable television]] (from 1932): both via [[coaxial cable]],  originally serving principally as transmission media for programming produced at either radio or [[television station]]s, but later expanding into a broad universe of cable-originated [[cable channel|channels]].\n* [[Direct-broadcast satellite]] (DBS) (from c. 1974) and [[satellite radio]] (from c. 1990): meant for direct-to-home broadcast programming (as opposed to studio network uplinks and downlinks), provides a mix of traditional radio or television broadcast programming, or both, with dedicated satellite radio programming. (See also: [[Satellite television]])\n* [[Webcast#Origins|Webcasting]] of video/television (from c. 1993) and audio/radio (from c. 1994) streams: offers a mix of traditional radio and television station broadcast programming with dedicated [[Internet radio]] and [[Internet television]].\n\n==Economic models==\nThere are several means of providing financial support for continuous broadcasting:\n* [[Commercial broadcasting]]: for-profit, usually privately owned stations, channels, networks, or services providing programming to the public, supported by the sale of time to advertisers for [[radio advertisement|radio]] or [[television advertisement]]s during or in breaks between programs, often in combination with cable or [[pay cable]] subscription fees. \n* [[Public broadcasting]]: usually [[non-profit]], publicly owned stations or networks supported by license fees, government funds, grants from foundations, corporate [[underwriting]], and audience memberships and/or contributions, or a combination of these.\n*Community broadcasting\n\nBroadcasters may rely on a combination of these [[business model]]s. For example, in the United States, [[National Public Radio]] (NPR) and the [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS, television)  supplement public membership subscriptions and grants with funding from the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] (CPB), which is allocated bi-annually by Congress. US public broadcasting corporate and charitable grants are generally given in consideration of [[underwriting spot]]s which differ from commercial advertisements in that they are governed by specific [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] restrictions, which prohibit the advocacy of a product or a \"call to action\".\n\n==Recorded and live forms==\n[[File:TV Station Control Room.JPG|thumb|A [[television studio]] [[production control room]] in [[Olympia, Washington]], August 2008.]]\n\nThe first regular television broadcasts started in 1937. Broadcasts can be classified as \"recorded\" or \"live\". The former allows correcting errors, and removing superfluous or undesired material, rearranging it, applying [[slow-motion]] and repetitions, and other techniques to enhance the program. However, some live events like [[sports television]] can include some of the aspects including slow-motion clips of important goals/hits, etc., in between the [[live television]] telecast. American radio-network broadcasters habitually forbade prerecorded broadcasts in the 1930s and 1940s requiring radio programs played for the Eastern and Central [[time zone]]s to be repeated three hours later for the Pacific time zone (See: [[Effects of time on North American broadcasting]]). This restriction was dropped for special occasions, as in the case of the German [[dirigible]] airship ''[[Hindenburg disaster|Hindenburg]]'' disaster at [[Lakehurst, New Jersey]], in 1937. During [[World War II]], prerecorded broadcasts from war correspondents were allowed on U.S. radio. In addition, American radio programs were recorded for playback by [[Armed Forces Radio]] [[radio station]]s around the world.\n\nA disadvantage of recording first is that the public may know the outcome of an event from another source, which may be a \"[[spoiler (media)|spoiler]]\". In addition, prerecording prevents [[live radio]] [[announcer]]s from deviating from an officially approved [[screenplay|script]], as occurred with [[propaganda]] broadcasts from Germany in the 1940s and with [[Voice of Russia|Radio Moscow]] in the 1980s. Many events are advertised as being live, although they are often \"recorded live\" (sometimes called \"[[live television|live]]-to-[[video tape|tape]]\"). This is particularly true of performances of musical artists on radio when they visit for an in-studio [[concert]] performance. Similar situations have occurred in [[television production]] (\"''[[The Cosby Show]]'' is recorded in front of a [[live television]] studio [[audience]]\") and [[news broadcasting]].\n\nA broadcast may be distributed through several physical means. If coming directly from the [[radio studio]] at a single station or [[television station]], it is simply sent through the [[studio/transmitter link]] to the [[transmitter]] and hence from the [[television antenna]] located on the [[radio masts and towers]] out to the world. Programming may also come through a [[communications satellite]], played either live or recorded for later transmission. Networks of stations may [[simulcast]] the same programming at the same time, originally via [[microwave]] link, now usually by satellite. Distribution to stations or networks may also be through physical media, such as [[magnetic tape]], [[compact disc]] (CD), [[DVD]], and sometimes other formats. Usually these are included in another broadcast, such as when [[electronic news gathering]] (ENG) returns a story to the station for inclusion on a [[news program]]me.\n\nThe final leg of broadcast distribution is how the signal gets to the listener or viewer. It may come over the air as with a [[radio station]] or [[television station]] to an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] and [[radio receiver]], or may come through [[cable television]]<ref>http://www.diwaxx.ru/</ref> or [[cable radio]] (or \"[[wireless cable]]\") via the station or directly from a network. The [[Internet]] may also bring either [[internet radio]] or [[streaming media]] television to the recipient, especially with [[multicast]]ing allowing the signal and [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] to be shared. The term \"[[broadcast network]]\" is often used to distinguish networks that broadcast an over-the-air television signals that can be received using a [[tuner (television)]] inside a [[television set]] with a [[television antenna]] from so-called networks that are broadcast only via [[cable television]] ([[cablecast]]) or [[satellite television]] that uses a [[dish antenna]]. The term \"[[broadcast television]]\" can refer to the [[television program]]s of such networks.\n\n== Social impact ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}\n[[File:WTUL Microphone.jpg|thumb|left|[[Radio station]] [[WTUL]] studio, [[Tulane University]], [[New Orleans]]]]\n\nThe sequencing of content in a broadcast is called a [[scheduling (broadcasting)|schedule]]. As with all technological endeavors, a number of technical terms and [[slang]] have developed. A list of these terms can be found at [[List of broadcasting terms]]. [[Television]] and [[radio]] programs are distributed through radio broadcasting or [[cable television|cable]], often both simultaneously. By coding signals and having a [[cable converter box]] with [[Code (cryptography)|decoding]] equipment in [[home]]s, the latter also enables [[subscription]]-based channels, [[pay-tv]] and [[pay-per-view]] services. In his essay, [[John Durham Peters]] wrote that [[communication]] is a tool used for dissemination. Durham stated, \"[[Dissemination]] is a lens&mdash;sometimes a usefully distorting one&mdash;that helps us tackle basic issues such as interaction, presence, and space and time...on the agenda of any future [[communication theory]] in general\" (Durham, 211). Dissemination focuses on the message being relayed from one main source to one large [[audience]] without the exchange of [[dialogue]] in between. It is possible for the message to be [[Propaganda|changed or corrupted by government officials]] once the main source releases it. There is no way to predetermine how the larger population or audience will absorb the message. They can choose to listen, analyze, or simply ignore it. Dissemination in communication is widely used in the world of broadcasting.\n\nBroadcasting focuses on getting a message out and it is up to the general public to do what they wish with it. Durham also states that broadcasting is used to address an open-ended destination (Durham, 212). There are many forms of broadcasting, but they all aim to distribute a signal that will reach the target [[audience]]. Broadcasters typically arrange audiences into entire assemblies (Durham, 213). In terms of media broadcasting, a [[radio show]] can gather a large number of followers who tune in every day to specifically listen to that specific [[disc jockey]]. The disc jockey follows the script for his or her radio show and just talks into the [[microphone]].<ref name=broadcasting>{{cite journal|last=Schlosberg|first=Justin|title=Why Does Illegal Broadcasting Continue To Thrive In The Age Of Spectrum Liberalization?|journal=Academic Search Premier|year=2011|page=7|url=http://web.ebscohost.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&sid=1d8495be-1c1c-4423-ad48-1f6054f42876%40sessionmgr111&hid=103|accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref> He or she does not expect immediate feedback from any listeners.
