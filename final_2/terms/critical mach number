When the aircraft's airspeed reaches the critical Mach number, the speed of the airflow in some areas near the airframe reaches the speed of sound, even though the aircraft itself has an airspeed lower than Mach 1.0.  This creates a weak [[shock wave]].  As the aircraft exceeds the critical Mach number, its [[drag coefficient]] increases suddenly, causing [[drag divergence Mach number|dramatically increased drag]],<ref name=\"Clancy Ch11\">Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Chapter 11</ref> and, in an aircraft not designed for [[transonic]] or [[supersonic]] speeds, changes to the airflow over the [[flight control surfaces]] lead to deterioration in control of the aircraft.<ref name=\"Clancy Ch11\"/>\n\nIn aircraft not designed to fly at or above the critical Mach number, the shock waves that form in the airflow over the wing and tailplane are sufficient to [[Stall (fluid mechanics)|stall]] the wing, render the control surfaces ineffective, or lead to loss of control of the aircraft (such as [[Mach tuck]], when shock waves in the airflow over the elevator send the aircraft into an uncontrollable dive).  These problematic phenomena appearing at or above the critical Mach number became known as [[compressibility]].  Compressibility led to a number of accidents involving high-speed military and experimental aircraft in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nAlthough unknown at the time, compressibility was the cause of the phenomenon known as the [[sound barrier]].  1940s-era military [[subsonic aircraft]], such as the [[Supermarine Spitfire]], [[BF 109]], [[P-51 Mustang]], [[Gloster Meteor]], [[He 162]], and [[P-80]], have relatively thick, unswept wings, and are incapable of reaching Mach 1.0 in controlled flight.  In 1947, [[Chuck Yeager]] flew the [[Bell X-1]] (also with an unswept wing, but a much thinner one), reaching Mach 1.06 and beyond, and the sound barrier was finally broken.\n\nEarly [[transonic]] military aircraft, such as the [[Hawker Hunter]] and [[F-86 Sabre]], were designed to fly satisfactorily even at speeds greater than their critical Mach number.  They did not possess sufficient engine thrust to break the sound barrier in level flight, but could exceed Mach 1.0 in a dive while remaining controllable.  Modern [[jet airliner]]s, such as [[Airbus]] and [[Boeing]] aircraft, have maximum operating Mach numbers slower than Mach 1.0.\n\n[[Supersonic]] aircraft, such as [[Concorde]], the [[English Electric Lightning]], [[Lockheed F-104]], [[Dassault Mirage III]], and [[MiG 21]], are designed to exceed Mach 1.0 in level flight, and, therefore, are designed with very thin wings.  Their critical Mach numbers are higher than those of subsonic and transonic aircraft, but are still less than Mach 1.0.\n\nThe actual critical Mach number varies from wing to wing.  In general, a thicker wing will have a lower critical Mach number, because a thicker wing deflects the airflow passing around it more than a thinner wing does, and thus accelerates the airflow to a faster speed.  For instance, the fairly-thick wing on the [[P-38 Lightning]] has a critical Mach number of about .69.  The aircraft could occasionally reach this speed in dives, leading to a number of crashes.  The [[Supermarine Spitfire]]'s much thinner wing gave it a considerably higher critical Mach number (about 0.89).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Drag divergence Mach number]]\n\n== References ==\n* Clancy, L.J.
