A meta-ethical question is abstract and relates to a wide range of more specific practical questions. For example, \"Is it ever possible to have secure knowledge of what is right and wrong?\" would be a meta-ethical question.\n\nMeta-ethics has always accompanied philosophical ethics. For example, Aristotle implies that less precise knowledge is possible in ethics than in other spheres of inquiry, and he regards ethical knowledge as depending upon habit and acculturation in a way that makes it distinctive from other kinds of knowledge. Meta-ethics is also important in [[George Edward Moore|G.E. Moore]]'s ''[[Principia Ethica]]'' from 1903. In it he first wrote about what he called ''the [[naturalistic fallacy]]''. Moore was seen to reject [[Ethical naturalism|naturalism]] in ethics, in his [[Open Question Argument]]. This made thinkers look again at second order questions about ethics. Earlier, the Scottish [[philosopher]] [[David Hume]] had put forward a similar view on the difference between [[Is-ought problem|facts and values]].\n\nStudies of how we know in ethics divide into [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]] and [[non-cognitivism]]; this is similar to the contrast between descriptivists and non-descriptivists. Non-cognitivism is the claim that when we judge something as right or wrong, this is neither true nor false. We may for example be only expressing our emotional feelings about these things.<ref>http://www.iep.utm.edu/non-cogn/</ref> Cognitivism can then be seen as the claim that when we talk about right and wrong, we are talking about matters of fact.\n\nThe [[ontology]] of ethics is about [[Value (ethics)|value]]-bearing things or properties, i.e. the kind of things or stuff referred to by ethical propositions. Non-descriptivists and non-cognitivists believe that ethics does not need a specific ontology, since ethical propositions do not refer. This is known as an anti-realist position. Realists on the other hand must explain what kind of entities, properties or states are relevant for ethics, how they have value, and why they guide and motivate our actions.<ref>Miller, C. (2009). The Conditions of Moral Realism. The Journal of Philosophical Research, 34, 123-155.</ref>\n\n==Normative ethics==\n{{Main article|Normative ethics}}\nNormative ethics is the study of ethical action. It is the branch of ethics that investigates the set of questions that arise when considering how one ought to act, morally speaking. Normative ethics is distinct from [[meta-ethics]] because it examines standards for the rightness and wrongness of actions, while meta-ethics studies the meaning of moral language and the metaphysics of moral facts.<ref name=bbc/> Normative ethics is also distinct from [[descriptive ethics]], as the latter is an empirical investigation of people's moral beliefs. To put it another way, descriptive ethics would be concerned with determining what proportion of people believe that killing is always wrong, while normative ethics is concerned with whether it is correct to hold such a belief. Hence, normative ethics is sometimes called prescriptive, rather than descriptive. However, on certain versions of the meta-ethical view called [[moral realism]], moral facts are both descriptive and prescriptive at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cavalier|first=Robert|title=Meta-ethics, Normative Ethics, and Applied Ethics|work=Online Guide to Ethics and Moral Philosophy|url=http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/Cavalier/80130/part2/II_preface.html|accessdate=February 26, 2014|archivedate=November 12, 2013|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20131112114345/http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/Cavalier/80130/part2/II_preface.html}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, normative ethics (also known as moral theory) was the study of what makes actions right and wrong. These theories offered an overarching moral principle one could appeal to in resolving difficult moral decisions.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, moral theories became more complex and are no longer concerned solely with rightness and wrongness, but are interested in many different kinds of moral status.  During the middle of the century, the study of normative ethics declined as meta-ethics grew in prominence. This focus on meta-ethics was in part caused by an intense linguistic focus in [[analytic philosophy]] and by the popularity of [[logical positivism]].\n\nIn 1971 [[John Rawls]] published ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', noteworthy in its pursuit of moral arguments and eschewing of meta-ethics. This publication set the trend for renewed interest in normative ethics.\n\n===Virtue ethics===\n{{main article|Virtue ethics}}\n[[File:Socrates BM GR1973.03-27.16.jpg|thumb|[[Socrates]]|upright=0.9]]\nVirtue ethics describes the character of a moral agent as a driving force for ethical behavior, and is used to describe the ethics of [[Socrates]], [[Aristotle]], and other early Greek philosophers. [[Socrates]] (469\u2013399&nbsp;BC) was one of the first [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] to encourage both scholars and the common citizen to turn their attention from the outside world to the condition of humankind. In this view, [[knowledge]] bearing on human life was placed highest, while all other knowledge were secondary. [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|Self-knowledge]] was considered necessary for success and inherently an essential good. A self-aware person will act completely within his capabilities to his pinnacle, while an ignorant person will flounder and encounter difficulty. To Socrates, a person must become aware of every fact (and its context) relevant to his existence, if he wishes to attain self-knowledge. He posited that people will naturally do what is good, if they know what is right. Evil or bad actions are the result of ignorance. If a criminal was truly aware of the intellectual and spiritual consequences of his actions, he would neither commit nor even consider committing those actions. Any person who knows what is truly right will automatically do it, according to Socrates. While he correlated knowledge with [[virtue]], he similarly equated virtue with [[joy]]. The truly wise man will know what is right, do what is good, and therefore be happy.<ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\">{{cite book|author1=William S. Sahakian|author2=Mabel Lewis Sahakian|title=Ideas of the Great Philosophers|year=1966|publisher=Barnes & Noble|isbn=978-1-56619-271-2}}</ref>{{rp|32\u201333}}\n\n[[Aristotle]] (384\u2013323&nbsp;BC) posited an ethical system that may be termed \"self-realizationism\". In Aristotle's view, when a person acts in accordance with his nature and realizes his full potential, he will do good and be content. At birth, a baby is not a person, but a potential person. To become a \"real\" person, the child's inherent potential must be realized. Unhappiness and frustration are caused by the unrealized potential of a person, leading to failed goals and a poor life. Aristotle said, \"[[Nature]] does nothing in vain.\" Therefore, it is imperative for people to act in accordance with their nature and develop their latent talents in order to be content and complete. Happiness was held to be the ultimate goal. All other things, such as civic life or [[wealth]], are merely means to the end. Self-realization, the awareness of one's nature and the development of one's talents, is the surest path to happiness.<ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\"/>{{rp|33\u201335}}\n\nAristotle asserted that man had three natures: vegetable (physical/metabolism), animal (emotional/appetite) and rational (mental/conceptual). Physical nature can be assuaged through exercise and care, emotional nature through indulgence of instinct and urges, and mental through human reason and developed potential. Rational development was considered the most important, as essential to philosophical self-awareness and as uniquely human. [[Moderation]] was encouraged, with the extremes seen as degraded and immoral. For example, [[courage]] is the moderate virtue between the extremes of [[cowardice]] and [[recklessness (psychology)|recklessness]]. Man should not simply live, but live well with conduct governed by moderate virtue. This is regarded as difficult, as virtue denotes doing the right thing, to the right person, at the right time, to the proper extent, in the correct fashion, for the right reason.<ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\"/>{{rp|35\u201337}}\n\n====Stoicism====\n{{main article|Stoicism}}\n[[File:Epictetus.jpg|thumb|[[Epictetus]]|upright=0.9]]\nThe [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Epictetus]] posited that the greatest good was contentment and serenity. Peace of mind, or [[Apatheia]], was of the highest [[Value (ethics)|value]]; self-mastery over one's desires and emotions leads to spiritual peace. The \"unconquerable will\" is central to this philosophy. The individual's will should be independent and inviolate. Allowing a person to disturb the mental equilibrium is in essence offering yourself in slavery. If a person is free to anger you at will, you have no control over your internal world, and therefore no freedom. Freedom from material attachments is also necessary. If a thing breaks, the person should not be upset, but realize it was a thing that could break. Similarly, if someone should die, those close to them should hold to their serenity because the loved one was made of flesh and blood destined to death. Stoic philosophy says to accept things that cannot be changed, resigning oneself to existence and enduring in a rational fashion. Death is not feared. People do not \"lose\" their life, but instead \"return\", for they are returning to God (who initially gave what the person is as a person). Epictetus said difficult problems in life should not be avoided, but rather embraced. They are spiritual exercises needed for the health of the spirit, just as physical exercise is required for the health of the body. He also stated that sex and sexual desire are to be avoided as the greatest threat to the integrity and equilibrium of a man's mind. Abstinence is highly desirable. Epictetus said remaining abstinent in the face of temptation was a victory for which a man could be proud.<ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\"/>{{rp|38\u201341}}\n\n====Contemporary virtue ethics====\nModern virtue ethics was popularized during the late 20th century in large part as a response to [[G. E. M. Anscombe]]'s \"[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]\". Anscombe argues that consequentialist and deontological ethics are only feasible as universal theories if the two schools ground themselves in divine law. As a deeply devoted Christian herself, Anscombe proposed that either those who do not give ethical credence to notions of divine law take up virtue ethics, which does not necessitate universal laws as agents themselves are investigated for virtue or vice and held up to \"universal standards\", or that those who wish to be utilitarian or consequentialist ground their theories in religious conviction.<ref name=\"Vries\">{{cite book|author1=Professor Michiel S.

There are several schools of Hedonist thought ranging from those advocating the indulgence of even momentary desires to those teaching a pursuit of spiritual bliss. In their consideration of consequences, they range from those advocating [[self-gratification]] regardless of the pain and expense to others, to those stating that the most ethical pursuit maximizes pleasure and happiness for the most people.<ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\"/>{{rp|37}}\n\n====Cyrenaic hedonism====\nFounded by [[Aristippus]] of Cyrene, [[Cyrenaics]] supported immediate gratification or pleasure. \"Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.\" Even fleeting desires should be indulged, for fear the opportunity should be forever lost. There was little to no concern with the future, the present dominating in the pursuit for immediate pleasure. Cyrenaic hedonism encouraged the pursuit of enjoyment and indulgence without hesitation, believing pleasure to be the only good.<ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\"/>{{rp|37}}\n\n====Epicureanism====\n{{Main article|Epicureanism}}\nEpicurean ethics is a hedonist form of virtue ethics. [[Epicurus]] \"presented a sustained argument that pleasure, correctly understood, will coincide with virtue\".<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ancient/#9 Ancient Ethical Theory], ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.</ref> He rejected the extremism of the [[Cyrenaics]], believing some pleasures and indulgences to be detrimental to human beings. [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] observed that indiscriminate indulgence sometimes resulted in negative consequences. Some experiences were therefore rejected out of hand, and some unpleasant experiences endured in the present to ensure a better life in the future. To Epicurus the ''summum bonum'', or greatest good, was prudence, exercised through moderation and caution. Excessive indulgence can be destructive to pleasure and can even lead to pain. For example, eating one food too often will cause a person to lose taste for it. Eating too much food at once will lead to discomfort and ill-health. Pain and fear were to be avoided. Living was essentially good, barring pain and illness. Death was not to be feared. Fear was considered the source of most unhappiness. Conquering the fear of death would naturally lead to a happier life. Epicurus reasoned if there was an afterlife and immortality, the fear of death was irrational. If there was no life after death, then the person would not be alive to suffer, fear or worry; he would be non-existent in death. It is irrational to fret over circumstances that do not exist, such as one's state in death in the absence of an afterlife.<ref name=\"SahakianSahakian1966\"/>{{rp|37\u201338}}\n\n===State consequentialism===\n{{Main article|State consequentialism}}\n[[State consequentialism]], also known as Mohist consequentialism,<ref name=\"readings\">{{cite book|title=Readings in classical Chinese philosophy|year=2005|last=Ivanhoe|first=P.J.|last2= Van Norden|first2= Bryan William|publisher=[[Hackett Publishing]]|isbn=978-0-87220-780-6 |page=60|quote=he advocated a form of state consequentialism, which sought to maximize three basic goods: the wealth, order, and population of the state}}</ref> is an ethical theory that evaluates the moral worth of an action based on how much it contributes to the basic goods of a state.<ref name=readings/> The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' describes Mohist consequentialism, dating back to the 5th century BC, as \"a remarkably sophisticated version based on a plurality of intrinsic goods taken as constitutive of human welfare\".<ref>Fraser, Chris, \"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mohism/ Mohism]\", ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Edward N.

In contrast to Bentham's views, state consequentialism is not utilitarian because it is not hedonistic or individualistic.

Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right action is one that produces a good outcome, or consequence. This view is often expressed as the [[aphorism]] ''\"The ends justify the means\"''.\n\nThe term \"consequentialism\" was coined by [[G. E. M. Anscombe]] in her essay \"[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]\" in 1958, to describe what she saw as the central error of certain moral theories, such as those propounded by [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] and [[Henry Sidgwick|Sidgwick]].<ref name=\"Anscombe\">{{cite journal|authorlink=G.E.M.

Apart from this basic outline, there is little else that can be unequivocally said about consequentialism as such. However, there are some questions that many consequentialist theories address:\n* What sort of consequences count as good consequences?\n* Who is the primary beneficiary of moral action?\n* How are the consequences judged and who judges them?\n\nOne way to divide various consequentialisms is by the types of consequences that are taken to matter most, that is, which consequences count as good states of affairs. According to [[utilitarianism]], a good action is one that results in an increase in a positive effect, and the best action is one that results in that effect for the greatest number. Closely related is [[eudaimonia|eudaimonic]] consequentialism, according to which a full, flourishing life, which may or may not be the same as enjoying a great deal of pleasure, is the ultimate aim. Similarly, one might adopt an aesthetic consequentialism, in which the ultimate aim is to produce beauty. However, one might fix on non-psychological goods as the relevant effect. Thus, one might pursue an increase in [[Equality of outcome|material equality]] or [[Freedom (political)|political liberty]] instead of something like the more ephemeral \"pleasure\". Other theories adopt a package of several goods, all to be promoted equally.  Whether a particular consequentialist theory focuses on a single good or many, conflicts and tensions between different good states of affairs are to be expected and must be adjudicated.\n\n====Utilitarianism====\n{{Main article|Utilitarianism}}\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center\n | total_width       = 375\n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg\n | width1            = 536\n | height1           = 728\n | alt1              = \n | link1             = \n | caption1          = [[Jeremy Bentham]]\n<!--image 2-->\n | image2            = John Stuart Mill by London Stereoscopic Company, c1870.jpg\n | width2            = 1274\n | height2           = 1600\n | alt2              = \n | link2             = \n | caption2          = [[John Stuart Mill]]\n}}\nUtilitarianism is an ethical theory that argues the proper course of action is one that maximizes a positive effect, such as \"happiness\", \"welfare\", or the ability to live according to personal preferences.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Ethics Toolkit: A Compendium of Ethical Concepts and Methods|edition=|last=Baqgini|first=Julian|author-link=Julian Baggini |last2=Fosl|first2=Peter S.|author2-link=Peter S.

In rule utilitarianism the principle of utility is used to determine the validity of rules of conduct (moral principles). A rule like promise-keeping is established by looking at the consequences of a world in which people broke promises at will and a world in which promises were binding. Right and wrong are then defined as following or breaking those rules.<ref name=\"Carnegie Mellon University\">[http://caae.phil.cmu.edu/cavalier/80130/part2/sect9.html, Department of Philosophy, CMU]</ref>\n\n===Deontology===\n<!-- Section linked from \"Categorical imperative\" -->\n{{Main article|Deontological ethics}}\n[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]]|upright]]\n\nDeontological ethics or deontology (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd}}, ''deon'', \"obligation, duty\"; and {{lang|grc|-\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is an approach to ethics that determines goodness or rightness from examining [[acts]], or the rules and duties that the person doing the act strove to fulfill.<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/ Stanford.edu]</ref>  This is in contrast to [[consequentialism]], in which rightness is based on the consequences of an act, and not the act by itself.

For deontologists, the ends or consequences of people's actions are not important in and of themselves, and people's intentions are not important in and of themselves.\n\nImmanuel Kant's theory of ethics is considered deontological for several different reasons.<ref>Orend, Brian. 2000.

Kant's argument that to act in the morally right way, one must act from duty, begins with an argument that the highest good must be both good in itself, and good without qualification.<ref name=\"transition\">Kant, Immanuel. 1785. 'First Section: Transition from the Common Rational Knowledge of Morals to the Philosophical', [[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]].</ref> Something is 'good in itself' when it is [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsically good]], and 'good without qualification' when the addition of that thing never makes a situation ethically worse. Kant then argues that those things that are usually thought to be good, such as [[intelligence]], perseverance and [[pleasure]], fail to be either intrinsically good or good without qualification. Pleasure, for example, appears to not be good without qualification, because when people take pleasure in watching someone suffer, they make the situation ethically worse. He concludes that there is only one thing that is truly good:\n\n<blockquote>Nothing in the world\u2014indeed nothing even beyond the world\u2014can possibly be conceived which could be called good without qualification except a ''good will''.<ref name=\"transition\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Pragmatic ethics===\n{{Main article|Pragmatic ethics}}\nAssociated with the [[pragmatism|pragmatists]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and especially [[John Dewey]], pragmatic ethics holds that moral correctness evolves similarly to scientific knowledge: socially over the course of many lifetimes.

The biggest contributor to the anarchist ethics is the Russian zoologist, geographer, economist and political activist [[Peter Kropotkin]]. The anarchist ethics is a big and vague field which can depend upon different historical situations and different anarchist thinkers, but as Peter Kropotkin explains, \"any \u201cbourgeois\u201d or \u201cproletarian\u201d ethics rests, after all, on the common basis, on the common ethnological foundation, which at times exerts a very strong in\ufb02uence on the principles of the class or group morality.\" Still, most of the anarchist ethics schools are based on three fundamental ideas, which are: \"solidarity, equality and justice\". Kropotkin argues that Ethics is evolutionary and is inherited as a sort of a social instinct through History, and by so, he rejects any religious and transcendental explanation of ethics.<ref>[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-ethics-origin-and-development.pdf \"Ethics: Origin and Development\" by P\u00ebtr Kropotkin]</ref> Kropotkin suggests that the principle of equality which lies at the basis of anarchism is the same as the [[Golden rule]]: <blockquote>This principle of treating others as one wishes to be treated oneself, what is it but the very same principle as equality, the fundamental principle of anarchism? And how can any one manage to believe himself an anarchist unless he practices it? We do not wish to be ruled. And by this very fact, do we not declare that we ourselves wish to rule nobody? We do not wish to be deceived, we wish always to be told nothing but the truth. And by this very fact, do we not de- clare that we ourselves do not wish to deceive anybody, that we promise to always tell the truth, nothing but the truth, the whole truth? We do not wish to have the fruits of our labor stolen from us. And by that very fact, do we not declare that we respect the fruits of others' labor? By what right indeed can we demand that we should be treated in one fashion, reserving it to ourselves to treat others in a fashion entirely different? Our sense of equality revolts at such an idea.<ref>[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/AM/anarchist_moralityVI.html \"Anarchist morality\", chapter VI, P\u00ebtr Kropotkin]</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Postmodern ethics===\n{{Main article|Postmodernism}}\n{{Synthesis|date=July 2009}}\nThe 20th century saw a remarkable expansion and evolution of critical theory, following on earlier [[Marxism|Marxist Theory]] efforts to locate individuals within larger structural frameworks of ideology and action.\n\n[[Antihumanism|Antihumanists]] such as [[Louis Althusser]] and [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Structuralism|structuralists]] such as [[Roland Barthes]] challenged the possibilities of individual agency and the coherence of the notion of the 'individual' itself.{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} As critical theory developed in the later 20th century, [[post-structuralism]] sought to problematize human relationships to knowledge and 'objective' reality. [[Jacques Derrida]] argued that access to meaning and the 'real' was always deferred, and sought to demonstrate via recourse to the linguistic realm that \"there is nothing outside context\" (\"''il n'y a pas de hors-texte''\" is often mistranslated as \"there is nothing outside the text\"); at the same time, [[Jean Baudrillard]] theorised that signs and symbols or simulacra mask reality (and eventually the absence of reality itself), particularly in the consumer world.\n\nPost-structuralism and [[postmodernism]] argue that ethics must study the complex and relational conditions of actions.  A simple alignment of ideas of right and particular acts is not possible.  There will always be an ethical remainder that cannot be taken into account or often even recognized.  Such theorists find narrative (or, following Nietzsche and Foucault, [[genealogy]]) to be a helpful tool for understanding ethics because narrative is always about particular lived experiences in all their complexity rather than the assignment of an idea or norm to separate and individuated actions.\n\n[[Zygmunt Bauman]] says [[Postmodernity]] is best described as Modernity without illusion, the illusion being the belief that humanity can be repaired by some ethic principle.  Postmodernity can be seen in this light as accepting the messy nature of humanity as unchangeable.\n\nDavid Couzens Hoy states that [[Emmanuel Levinas]]'s writings on the face of the Other and [[Derrida]]'s meditations on the relevance of death to ethics are signs of the \"ethical turn\" in Continental philosophy that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s. Hoy describes post-critique ethics as the \"obligations that present themselves as necessarily to be fulfilled but are neither forced on one or are enforceable\" (2004, p.&nbsp;103).\n\nHoy's post-critique model uses the term ''ethical resistance''. Examples of this would be an individual's resistance to consumerism in a retreat to a simpler but perhaps harder lifestyle, or an individual's resistance to a terminal illness. Hoy describes Levinas's account as \"not the attempt to use power against itself, or to mobilize sectors of the population to exert their political power; the ethical resistance is instead the resistance of the powerless\"(2004, p.&nbsp;8).\n\nHoy concludes that\n{{quote|The ethical resistance of the powerless others to our capacity to exert power over them is therefore what imposes unenforceable obligations on us. The obligations are unenforceable precisely because of the other's lack of power. That actions are at once obligatory and at the same time unenforceable is what put them in the category of the ethical. Obligations that were enforced would, by the virtue of the force behind them, not be freely undertaken and would not be in the realm of the ethical. (2004, p.184)}}\n\nIn present-day terms the powerless may include the unborn, the terminally sick, the aged, the insane, and non-human animals. It is in these areas that ethical action in Hoy's sense will apply. Until legislation or the state apparatus enforces a moral order that addresses the causes of resistance these issues will remain in the ethical realm. For example, should animal experimentation become illegal in a society, it will no longer be an ethical issue on Hoy's definition. Likewise one hundred and fifty years ago, not having a black slave in America would have been an ethical choice. This later issue has been absorbed into the fabric of an enforceable social order and is therefore no longer an ethical issue in Hoy's sense.\n\n==Applied ethics==\n{{Main article|Applied ethics}}\nApplied ethics is a discipline of philosophy that attempts to apply ethical theory to real-life situations.  The discipline has many specialized fields, such as [[engineering ethics]], [[bioethics]], [[geoethics]], public service ethics and [[business ethics]].\n\n===Specific questions===\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2009}}\nApplied ethics is used in some aspects of determining public policy, as well as by individuals facing difficult decisions. The sort of questions addressed by applied ethics include: \"Is getting an abortion immoral?\" \"Is euthanasia immoral?\" \"Is affirmative action right or wrong?\" \"What are human rights, and how do we determine them?\" \"Do animals have rights as well?\" and \"Do individuals have the right of self determination?\"<ref name=bbc/>\n\nA more specific question could be: \"If someone else can make better out of his/her life than I can, is it then moral to sacrifice myself for them if needed?\" Without these questions there is no clear fulcrum on which to balance law, politics, and the practice of arbitration\u2014in fact, no common assumptions of all participants\u2014so the ability to formulate the questions are prior to rights balancing. But not all questions studied in applied ethics concern public policy. For example, making ethical judgments regarding questions such as, \"Is lying always wrong?\" and, \"If not, when is it permissible?\" is prior to any etiquette.\n\nPeople in-general are more comfortable with dichotomies (two opposites).  However, in ethics the issues are most often multifaceted and the best proposed actions address many different areas concurrently. In ethical decisions the answer is almost never a \"yes or no\", \"right or wrong\" statement. Many buttons are pushed so that the overall condition is improved and not to the benefit of any particular faction.\n\n===Particular fields of application===\n\n====Bioethics====\n{{Main article|Bioethics}}\nBioethics is the study of controversial ethics brought about by advances in [[biology]] and [[medicine]]. Bioethicists are concerned with the ethical questions that arise in the relationships among [[life sciences]], [[biotechnology]], [[medicine]], [[politics]], [[law]], and [[philosophy]]. It also includes the study of the more commonplace questions of values ([[primary care ethics|\"the ethics of the ordinary\"]]) that arise in primary care and other branches of medicine.\n\nBioethics also needs to address emerging biotechnologies that affect basic biology and future humans. These developments include [[cloning]], [[gene therapy]], [[human genetic engineering]], astroethics and life in space,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astroethics.com/ |title=Astroethics|accessdate=December 21, 2005|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20131023060209/http://www.astroethics.com/|archivedate=October 23, 2013}}</ref> and manipulation of basic biology through altered DNA, RNA and proteins,e.g.- \"three parent baby,where baby is born from genetically modified embryos, would have DNA from a mother, a father and from a female donor.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Freemont|first1=P.

It applies to all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the conduct of individuals and entire organizations.\n\nBusiness ethics has both [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] and descriptive dimensions. As a corporate practice and a career specialization, the field is primarily normative. Academics attempting to understand business behavior employ descriptive methods. The range and quantity of business ethical issues reflects the interaction of profit-maximizing behavior with non-economic concerns. Interest in business ethics accelerated dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s, both within major corporations and within academia. For example, today most major corporations promote their commitment to non-economic values under headings such as ethics codes and social responsibility charters. Adam Smith said, \"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.\"<ref>Smith, A (1776/1952). ''An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations''. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, p. 55.</ref> Governments use laws and regulations to point business behavior in what they perceive to be beneficial directions. Ethics implicitly regulates areas and details of behavior that lie beyond governmental control.<ref>Berle, A. A., & Means, G. C. (1932). The Modern Corporation and Private Property. New Jersey: Transaction Publishers. In this book, Berle and Means observe, \"Corporations have ceased to be merely legal devices through which the private business transactions of individuals may be carried on. Though still much used for this purpose, the corporate form has acquired a much larger significance. The corporation has, in fact, become both a method of property tenure and a means of organizing economic life. Grown to tremendous proportions, there may be said to have evolved a 'corporate system'\u2014as there once was a feudal system\u2014which has attracted to itself a combination of attributes and powers, and has attained a degree of prominence entitling it to be dealt with as a major social institution.&nbsp;... We are examining this institution probably before it has attained its zenith. Spectacular as its rise has been, every indication seems to be that the system will move forward to proportions which stagger imagination today&nbsp;... They [management] have placed the community in a position to demand that the modern corporation serve not only the owners&nbsp;... but all society.\" p. 1.</ref> The emergence of large corporations with limited relationships and sensitivity to the communities in which they operate accelerated the development of formal ethics regimes.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|Parker|et al.|2005|p=17}}</ref>\n\n====Machine ethics====\n{{Main article|Machine ethics}}\nIn ''Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong'', Wendell Wallach and Colin Allen conclude that issues in [[machine ethics]] will likely drive advancement in understanding of human ethics by forcing us to address gaps in modern normative theory and by providing a platform for experimental investigation.<ref name=Wallach2008>{{cite book|first1=Wendell |last1=Wallach|first2=Colin|last2=Allen|date=November 2008|title=Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong|isbn=978-0-19-537404-9|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=USA|ref=harv}}</ref> The effort to actually program a machine or artificial agent to behave as though instilled with a sense of ethics requires new specificity in our normative theories, especially regarding aspects customarily considered common-sense.

Some use the term \"moral psychology\" relatively narrowly to refer to the study of [[moral development]].<ref>See, for example, Lapsley (2006) and \"moral psychology\" (2007).</ref> However, others tend to use the term more broadly to include any topics at the intersection of ethics and psychology (and [[philosophy of mind]]).<ref>See, for example, Doris & Stich (2008) and Wallace (2007). Wallace writes: \"Moral psychology is the study of morality in its psychological dimensions\" (p. 86).</ref> Such topics are ones that involve the mind and are relevant to moral issues. Some of the main topics of the field are [[moral responsibility]], moral development, [[moral character]] (especially as related to [[virtue ethics]]), [[altruism]], [[psychological egoism]], [[moral luck]], and moral disagreement.<ref>See Doris & Stich (2008), \u00a71.</ref>\n\n===Evolutionary ethics===\n{{Main article|Evolutionary ethics}}\n{{See also|Evolution of morality}}\nEvolutionary ethics concerns approaches to ethics (morality) based on the role of evolution in shaping human psychology and behavior. Such approaches may be based in scientific fields such as [[evolutionary psychology]] or [[sociobiology]], with a focus on understanding and explaining observed ethical preferences and choices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/evol-eth/|title=Evolutionary Ethics|author=Doris Schroeder|accessdate=January 5, 2010 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20131007081051/http://www.iep.utm.edu/evol-eth/ |archivedate=October 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Descriptive ethics==\n{{Main article|Descriptive ethics}}\nDescriptive ethics is on the less philosophical end of the spectrum, since it seeks to gather particular information about how people live and draw general conclusions based on observed patterns. Abstract and theoretical questions that are more clearly philosophical\u2014such as, \"Is ethical knowledge possible?\"\u2014are not central to descriptive ethics. Descriptive ethics offers a [[Value-neutral|value-free]] approach to ethics, which defines it as a social science rather than [[humanities|a humanity]].  Its examination of ethics doesn't start with a preconceived theory, but rather investigates [[revealed preference|observations of actual choices]] made by moral agents in practice. Some philosophers rely on descriptive ethics and choices made and unchallenged by a [[society]] or [[culture]] to derive categories, which typically vary by context. This can lead to [[situational ethics]] and [[situated ethics]]. These philosophers often view [[aesthetics]], [[etiquette]], and [[arbitration]] as more fundamental, percolating \"bottom up\" to imply the existence of, rather than explicitly prescribe, theories of value or of conduct. The study of descriptive ethics may include examinations of the following:\n* [[Ethical code]]s applied by various groups. Some consider aesthetics itself the basis of ethics\u2014and a personal [[moral core]] developed through art and storytelling as very influential in one's later ethical choices.\n* Informal theories of etiquette that tend to be less rigorous and more situational. Some consider etiquette a simple negative ethics, i.e., where can one evade an uncomfortable truth without doing wrong? One notable advocate of this view is [[Judith Martin]] (\"Miss Manners\"). According to this view, ethics is more a summary of [[common sense]] social decisions.\n* Practices in arbitration and [[law]], e.g., the claim that ethics itself is a matter of balancing \"right versus right\", i.e., putting priorities on two things that are both right, but that must be traded off carefully in each situation.\n* [[Revealed preference|Observed choices]] made by ordinary people, without expert aid or advice, who [[Voting|vote]], buy, and decide what is worth valuing. This is a major concern of sociology, [[political science]], and [[economics]].\n\n==See also==\n<!-- Please add related links to [[Outline of ethics]] and [[Index of ethics articles]] -->\n{{Portal|Ethics}}\n* [[Contemporary ethics]]\n* [[Corporate social responsibility]]\n* [[Declaration of Geneva]]\n* [[Declaration of Helsinki]]\n* [[Deductive reasoning]]\n* [[Descriptive ethics]]\n* [[Dharma]]\n* [[Ethical movement]]\n* [[Ethics paper]]\n* [[Index of ethics articles]]\u2014alphabetical list of ethics-related articles\n* [[Moral psychology]]\n* [[Outline of ethics]]\u2014list of ethics-related articles, arranged by sub-topic\n* [[Practical philosophy]]\n* [[Science of morality]]\n* [[Theory of justification]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Hoy, D.
