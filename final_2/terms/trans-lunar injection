TLI occurs at the red dot near Earth.]]\nA '''trans-lunar injection''' (TLI) is a [[Orbital maneuver|propulsive maneuver]] used to set a [[spacecraft]] on a [[trajectory]] that will cause it to arrive at the [[Moon]].\n\nTypical lunar transfer trajectories approximate [[Hohmann transfer orbit|Hohmann transfer]]s, although [[low-energy transfer]]s have also been used in some cases, as with the [[Hiten]] probe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1990-007A |title=Hiten |publisher=[[NASA]]}}</ref>  For short duration missions without significant [[Perturbation theory|perturbations]] from sources outside the Earth-Moon system, a fast Hohmann transfer is typically more practical.\n\nA spacecraft performs TLI to begin a lunar transfer from a low circular [[parking orbit]] around [[Earth]].  The large TLI [[Orbital maneuver|burn]], usually performed by a chemical [[rocket]] engine, increases the spacecraft's velocity, changing its orbit from a circular [[low Earth orbit]] to a highly [[Elliptical orbit|eccentric orbit]].  As the spacecraft begins coasting on the lunar transfer arc, its trajectory approximates an elliptical orbit about the Earth with an [[apsis|apogee]] near to the radius of the Moon's orbit.  The TLI burn is sized and timed to precisely target the Moon as it revolves around the Earth.   The burn is timed so that the spacecraft nears apogee as the Moon approaches.  Finally, the spacecraft enters the Moon's [[Sphere of influence (astrodynamics)|sphere of influence]], making a hyperbolic lunar swingby.\n\n== Modeling ==\n[[File:Constellation trans-lunar injection.jpg|thumb |Artist\u2019s concept of NASA\u2019s [[Constellation program|Constellation]] stack performing the trans-lunar injection burn]]\n\n=== Patched conics ===\nTLI targeting and lunar transfers are a specific application of the [[N-body problem|n body problem]], which may be approximated in various ways. The simplest way to explore lunar transfer trajectories is by the method of [[Patched Conics|patched conics]].  The spacecraft is assumed to accelerate only under classical 2 body dynamics, being dominated by the Earth until it reaches the Moon's [[Sphere of influence (astrodynamics)|sphere of influence]].  Motion in a patched-conic system is deterministic and simple to calculate, lending itself for rough mission design and \"[[Back-of-the-envelope calculation|back of the envelope]]\" studies.\n\n=== Restricted circular three body (RC3B) ===\nMore realistically, however, the spacecraft is subject to gravitational forces from many bodies.  Gravitation from Earth and Moon dominate the spacecraft's acceleration, and since the spacecraft's own mass is negligible in comparison, the spacecraft's trajectory may be better approximated as a [[Euler's three-body problem|restricted three-body problem]].  This model is a closer approximation but lacks an analytic solution,<ref>[[Henri Poincar\u00e9]], ''Les M\u00e9thodes Nouvelles de M\u00e9canique C\u00e9leste'', Paris, Gauthier-Villars et fils, 1892-99.</ref> requiring numerical calculation via methods such as [[Runge kutta|Runge-Kutta]].<ref>[[Victor Szebehely]], ''Theory of Orbits, The Restricted Problem of Three Bodies'', Yale University, Academic Press, 1967.</ref>\n\n=== Further accuracy ===\nMore detailed simulation involves modeling the Moon's true orbital motion; gravitation from other astronomical bodies; the non-uniformity of the Earth's and Moon's [[Gravitational field|gravity]]; including [[Solar wind|solar radiation pressure]]; and so on.  Propagating spacecraft motion in such a model is numerically intensive, but necessary for true mission accuracy.\n\n=== Free return ===\nIn some cases it is possible to design a TLI to target a [[free return trajectory]], so that the spacecraft will loop around behind the Moon and return to Earth without need for further propulsive maneuvers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schwaninger|first=Arthur J.|title=Trajectories in the Earth-Moon Space with Symmetrical Free Return Properties|publisher=[[NASA]] / [[Marshall Space Flight Center]]|location=Huntsville, Alabama|year=1963|series=Technical Note D-1833|url=http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19630007117_1963007117.pdf}}</ref>  Such free return trajectories add a margin of safety to [[human spaceflight]] missions, since the spacecraft will return to Earth \"for free\" after the initial TLI burn.\n\n== History ==\nThe first space probe to successfully perform TLI was the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Luna 1]] on January 2, 1959.  The first human-crewed mission to successfully perform this procedure, and thus becoming the first humans to leave the Earth's influence, was [[Apollo 8]] on December 21, 1968.\n\nFor the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] lunar missions, the restartable [[J-2 (rocket engine)|J-2]] engine in the third ([[S-IVB]]) stage of the [[Saturn V]] rocket performed TLI.  This particular TLI [[combustion|burn]] lasted approximately 350 seconds, providing 3.05 to 3.25&nbsp;km/s (10,000 to 10,600&nbsp;ft/s) of [[delta-v]], at which point the spacecraft was traveling at approximately 10.4&nbsp;km/s (34150&nbsp;ft/s) relative to the Earth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-24_Translunar_Injection.htm |title=Apollo By the Numbers |publisher=[[NASA]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041118103812/http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-24_Translunar_Injection.htm|archivedate=2004-11-18}}</ref>  The Apollo 8 TLI was spectacularly observed from the Hawaiian Islands in the pre-dawn sky south of Waikiki, photographed and reported in the papers the next day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newspaperarchive.com/independent-star-news/1968-12-22 |title=Independent Star News, Sunday, December 22, 1968 }} \"The TLI firing was begun at PST while the craft was over Hawaii and it was reported there that the burn was visible from the ground.\"</ref>  In 1969, the Apollo 10 pre-dawn TLI was visible from [[Cloncurry]], [[Australia]].<ref name=ShadowOfTheMoon372>{{cite book |title=[[In the Shadow of the Moon (book)|In the Shadow of the Moon]]|last=French |first=Francis |author2=Colin Burgess  |year=2007 |publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]] |isbn=978-0-8032-1128-5  |page=372}}</ref>  It was described as resembling car headlights coming over a hill in fog, with the spacecraft appearing as a bright comet with a greenish tinge.<ref name=ShadowOfTheMoon372/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Trans-Earth injection]]\n* [[Trans-Mars injection]]\n* [[Low energy transfer]]\n* [[Astrodynamics]]\n* [[Comparison of super heavy lift launch systems]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n{{refend}}\n{{Include-NASA}}\n\n[[Category:Astrodynamics]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft propulsion]]\n[[Category:Orbital maneuvers]]\n[[Category:Exploration of the Moon]]\n[[Category:Apollo program]]\n\n[[ja:\u6708\u9077\u79fb\u8ecc\u9053]]"}]}}}}
