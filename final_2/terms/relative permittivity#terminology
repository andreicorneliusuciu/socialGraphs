Then, using the same capacitor and distance between its plates, the capacitance ''C<sub>x</sub>'' with a [[dielectric]] between the plates is measured. The relative dielectric constant can be then calculated as\n\n:<math>\\varepsilon_{r} = \\frac{C_{x}} {C_{0}}.</math>\n\nFor time-variant [[electromagnetic field]]s, this quantity becomes [[frequency]]-dependent. An indirect technique to calculate ''\u03b5<sub>r</sub>'' is conversion of radio frequency [[S-parameter]] measurement results.

If a material with a high relative permittivity is placed in an [[electric field]], the magnitude of that field will be measurably reduced within the volume of the dielectric. This fact is commonly used to increase the capacitance of a particular capacitor design. The layers beneath etched conductors in printed circuit boards ([[Printed circuit board|PCBs]]) also act as dielectrics.\n\n===Communication===\nDielectrics are used in [[Radio frequency|RF]] transmission lines. In a [[coaxial]] cable, [[polyethylene]] can be used between the center conductor and outside shield. It can also be placed inside waveguides to form [[Dielectric resonator filter|filters]]. [[Optical fibers]] are examples of ''dielectric [[waveguide]]s''. They consist of dielectric materials that are purposely doped with impurities so as to control the precise value of ''\u03b5<sub>r</sub>'' within the cross-section. This controls the [[refractive index]] of the material and therefore also the optical modes of transmission. However, in these cases it is technically the relative permittivity that matters, as they are not operated in the electrostatic limit.\n\n===Environment===\nThe relative permittivity of air changes with temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure.<ref>A Low Cost Integrated Interface for Capacitive Sensors, Ali Heidary, Thesis, p. 22</ref>  Sensors can be constructed to detect changes in capacitance caused by changes in the relative permittivity.  Most of this change is due to effects of temperature and humidity as the barometric pressure is fairly stable. Using the capacitance change, along with the measured temperature, the relative humidity can be obtained using engineering formulas.\n\n===Chemistry===\nThe relative static permittivity of a solvent is a relative measure of its [[chemical polarity]]. For example, [[water (molecule)|water]] is very polar, and has a dielectric constant of 80.10 at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C while ''n''-[[hexane]] is non-polar, and has a dielectric constant of 1.89 at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{RubberBible86th}}</ref> This information is important when designing separation, [[sample preparation]] and [[chromatography]] techniques in [[analytical chemistry]].\n\nThe correlation should, however, be treated with caution. For instance, [[dichloromethane]] has a value of \u03b5<sub>r</sub> of [[Dichloromethane (data page)|9.08]] (20&nbsp;\u00b0C) and is rather poorly soluble in water (13 g/L or 9.8 mL/L at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C); at the same time, [[tetrahydrofuran]] has its \u03b5<sub>r</sub> = [[Tetrahydrofuran (data page)|7.52]] at 22&nbsp;\u00b0C, but it is completely miscible with water.  In the case tetrahydrofuran, the oxygen atom can act as a [[hydrogen bond]] acceptor; where as dichloromethane cannot form hydrogen bonds with water. <!-- The commonly known \"like-dissolves-like\" principle could be useful here, as the probable reason for the discrepancy is the specific interaction between the oxygen atoms, as the THF could be treated as a homologue of water. -->\n\nThis is even more apparent when comparing the \u03b5<sub>r</sub> values of [[acetic acid]] (6.2528)<ref name=\"gaussian\">AE. Frisch, M. J. Frish, F. R. Clemente, G. W. Trucks. Gaussian 09 User's Reference. Gaussian, Inc.: Walligford, CT, 2009.- p. 257.</ref> and that of [[iodoethane]] (7.6177).<ref name=\"gaussian\" /> The large numerical value of \u03b5<sub>r</sub> is not surprising in the second case, as the [[iodine]] atom is easily polarizable; nevertheless, this does not imply that it is polar, too (electronic [[polarizability]] prevails over the orientational one in this case).\n\n==Lossy medium==\nAgain, similar as for [[Lossy medium|absolute permittivity]], relative permittivity for lossy materials can be formulated as:\n\n:<math> \\varepsilon_{r} = \\varepsilon_{r}' - \\frac{i\\sigma}{\\omega \\varepsilon_0}, </math>\n\nin terms of a \"dielectric conductivity\" \u03c3 (units S/m, [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] per meter), which \"sums over all the dissipative effects of the material; it may represent an actual [electrical] conductivity caused by migrating charge carriers and it may also refer to an energy loss associated with the dispersion of \u03b5' [the real-valued permittivity]\" (,<ref name=ChenVaradan2004/> p.&nbsp;8). Expanding the [[angular frequency]] \u03c9 = 2\u03c0c/\u03bb and the [[electric constant]] \u03b5<sub>0</sub> = 1/(\u00b5<sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup>), it reduces to:\n\n:<math> \\varepsilon_{r} = \\varepsilon_{r}' - i \\sigma \\lambda \\kappa, </math>\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength, ''c'' is the speed of light in vacuum and ''\u03ba = \u00b5<sub>0</sub>c/2\u03c0'' \u2248 60.0 S<sup>\u22121</sup> = 60.0 \u03a9 is a newly introduced constant (units reciprocal of [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]], or [[ohm]]s, such that \u03c3\u03bb\u03ba = \u03b5<sub>r</sub>\" remains unitless).\n\n==Metals==\nPermittivity is typically associated with [[dielectric materials]], however metals are described as having an effective permittivity, with real relative permittivity equal to one.<ref name=Lourtioz>{{cite book|author=Lourtioz, J.-M.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vSszZ2WuG_IC&pg=PA121|title=Photonic Crystals: Towards Nanoscale Photonic Devices|year=2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=3-540-24431-X|display-authors=etal}} eq.(4.6), p.&nbsp;121</ref> In the low-frequency region, which extends from radio frequencies to the far infrared and terahertz region, the plasma frequency of the electron gas is much greater than the electromagnetic propagation frequency, so the complex index n of a metal is practically a purely imaginary number; expressed in terms of effective relative permittivity it has a low imaginary value (loss) and a negative real-value (high conductivity).<ref>Lourtioz, eq.(4.8)\u2013(4.9), p.&nbsp;122</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|3}}\n*[[Curie temperature]]\n*[[Dielectric spectroscopy]]\n*[[Dielectric strength]]\n*[[Electret]]\n*[[Ferroelectricity]]\n*[[Green\u2013Kubo relations]]\n*[[High-k dielectric]]\n*[[Kramers\u2013Kronig relation]]\n*[[Linear response function]]\n*[[Low-k dielectric]]\n*[[Loss tangent]]\n*[[Permittivity]]\n*[[Refractive index]]\n*[[Permeability_(electromagnetism)]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Relative Permittivity}}\n[[Category:Electricity]]\n[[Category:Electric and magnetic fields in matter]]\n[[Category:Colloidal chemistry]]\n\n[[de:Dielektrizit\u00e4tszahl]]\n[[fr:Permittivit\u00e9]]\n[[it:Costante dielettrica]]\n[[vi:H\u1eb1ng s\u1ed1 \u0111i\u1ec7n m\u00f4i]]"}]}}}}
