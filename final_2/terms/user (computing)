Other terms for username include '''login name''', '''screenname''' (or '''screen name'''), '''[[Nickname#Computing|nickname]]''' (or '''nick''') and '''handle''', which is derived from the identical [[Citizen's Band radio]] term.\n\nSome software products provide services to other systems and have no direct [[end user]]s.\n\n=={{Anchor|END-USER}}End user==\n{{see also|End user}}\n\n[[End user]]s are the ultimate human users (also referred to as [[Operator (profession)|operators]]) of a software product.  The term is used to abstract and distinguish those who only use the software from the developers of the system, who enhance the software for end users.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://web.media.mit.edu/~lieber/Publications/End-User-Software-Engineering.pdf\n | title = The State of the Art in End-User Software Engineering\n | date = 2011-10-12 | accessdate = 2015-01-11\n | website = media.mit.edu | format = PDF\n}}</ref> In [[user-centered design]], it also distinguishes the software operator from the client who pays for its development and other [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] who may not directly use the software, but help establish its [[Software requirements|requirements]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://boxesandarrows.com/understanding-organizational-stakeholders-for-design-success/|title=Understanding Organizational Stakeholders for Design Success|date=2004-05-06|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-31}}</ref><ref>Rigsbee, Sarah, and William B.

It is sometimes specified for each persona which types of user interfaces it is comfortable with (due to previous experience or the interface's inherent simplicity), and what technical expertise and degree of knowledge it has in specific fields or [[discipline]]s.  When few constraints are imposed on the end-user category, especially when designing programs for use by the general public, it is common practice to expect minimal technical expertise or previous training in end users.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/end_user.html |title=What is end user? |accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref> In this context, [[graphical user interfaces]] (GUIs) are usually preferred to [[command-line interface]]s (CLIs) for the sake of [[User interface#Usability|usability]].<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.cscjournals.org/manuscript/Journals/IJHCI/volume4/Issue1/IJHCI-76.pdf\n | title = Usability of User Interface Styles for Learning Graphical Software Applications\n | date = 2014-09-18 | accessdate = 2015-01-11\n | author1 = Andisheh Feizi | author2 = Chui Yin Wong\n | website = cscjournals.org | format = PDF\n | pages = 1&ndash;2\n | quote = The development of GUI software applications has been one of the noteworthy improvements in programming field that reduce the difficulty of remembering syntax and semantics with the guidance of menu-based interactive properties it delivers.

It designates activities or techniques in which people who are not professional developers create automated behavior and complex data objects without significant knowledge of a programming language.\n\nSystems whose [[Actor (UML)|actor]] is another system or a [[software agent]] have no direct end users.\n\n==User account==\nA user's account allows a user to [[authentication|authenticate]] to a system and potentially to receive [[Authorization (computer access control)|authorization]] to [[Access control|access]] resources provided by or connected to that system; however, authentication does not imply authorization. To [[login|log in to]] an account, a user is typically required to [[authenticate]] oneself with a [[password]] or other [[credentials]] for the purposes of [[accounting]], [[computer security|security]], [[data logging|logging]], and [[resource management]].\n\nOnce the user has logged on, the operating system will often use an identifier such as an integer to refer to them, rather than their username, through a process known as [[identity correlation]]. In [[Unix]] systems, the username is correlated with a [[user identifier]] or ''user id''.\n\nComputer systems operate in one of two types based on what kind of users they have:\n* Single-user systems do not have a concept of several user accounts.\n* [[Multi-user]] systems have such a concept, and require users to identify themselves before using the system.\n\nEach user account on a multi-user system typically has a [[home directory]], in which to store [[Computer file|files]] pertaining exclusively to that user's activities, which is protected from access by other users (though a [[system administrator]] may have access). User accounts often contain a public [[user profile]], which contains basic information provided by the account's owner. The files stored in the home directory (and all other directories in the system) have [[file system permissions]] which are inspected by the [[operating system]] to determine which users are granted access to read or execute a file, or to store a new file in that directory.\n\nWhile systems expect most user accounts to be used by only a single person, many systems have a special account intended to allow anyone to use the system, such as the username \"anonymous\" for [[anonymous FTP]] and the username \"guest\" for a guest account.\n\n=== User names ===\nVarious computer operating-systems and applications expect/enforce different rules for the formats of user names.\n\nIn [[Microsoft Windows]] environments, for example, note the potential use of:<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url = https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380525%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\n | title = User Name Formats\n | website = MSDN\n | series = Developer technologies\n | publisher = Microsoft\n | access-date = 2016-01-11\n | quote = The down-level logon name format is used to specify a [[Windows domain|domain]] and a user account in that domain [...].\n}}\n</ref>\n\n* [[User Principal Name]] (UPN) format - for example: UserName@orgName.com\n* Down-Level Logon Name format - for example: DOMAIN\\accountName\n\nSome [[Online community|online communities]] use usernames as [[nickname]]s for the account holders. In some cases, a user may be better known by their username than by their real name, such as CmdrTaco ([[Rob Malda]]), founder of the website [[Slashdot]].\n\n==Terminology==\nSome usability professionals have expressed their dislike of the term \"user\", proposing it to be changed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/words_matter_talk_ab.html|title=Words Matter.
