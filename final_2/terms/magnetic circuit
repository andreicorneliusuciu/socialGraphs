The flux is usually generated by [[permanent magnet]]s or [[electromagnet]]s and confined to the path by [[magnetic core]]s consisting of [[ferromagnetic]] materials like iron, although there may be air gaps or other materials in the path.  Magnetic circuits are employed to efficiently channel [[magnetic field]]s in many devices such as [[electric motor]]s, [[Electric generator|generator]]s, [[transformer]]s, [[relay]]s, lifting [[electromagnet]]s, [[SQUID]]s, [[galvanometer]]s, and magnetic [[recording head]]s.\n\nThe concept of a \"magnetic circuit\" exploits a one-to-one correspondence between the equations of the magnetic field in an [[Magnetic saturation|unsaturated]] ferromagnetic material to that of an [[electrical circuit]].  Using this concept the magnetic fields of complex devices such as [[transformer]]s can be quickly solved using the methods and techniques developed for electrical circuits.\n\nSome examples of magnetic circuits are:\n* [[horseshoe]] [[magnet]] with iron [[magnet keeper|keeper]] (low-[[reluctance]] circuit)\n* horseshoe magnet with no keeper (high-reluctance circuit)\n* [[electric motor]] (variable-reluctance circuit)\n\n==Magnetomotive force (MMF)==\n{{Main| Magnetomotive force}}\nSimilar to the way that electromotive force ([[Electromotive force|EMF]]) drives a current of electrical charge in electrical circuits, [[magnetomotive force]] (MMF) 'drives' magnetic flux through magnetic circuits.  The term 'magnetomotive force', though, is a misnomer since it is not a force nor is anything moving.  It is perhaps better to call it simply MMF.  In analogy to the definition of [[electromotive force|EMF]], the magnetomotive force <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathcal{F}</math> around a closed loop is defined as:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{F} = \\oint \\mathbf{H} \\cdot \\operatorname{d}\\mathbf{l}</math>\n\nThe MMF represents the potential that a hypothetical [[magnetic monopole|magnetic charge]] would gain by completing the loop.  The magnetic flux that is driven is '''not''' a current of magnetic charge; it merely has the same relationship to MMF that electric current has to EMF.  (See microscopic origins of reluctance below for a further description.)\n\nThe unit of magnetomotive force is the [[ampere-turn]] (At), represented by a steady, direct [[electric current]] of one [[ampere]] flowing in a single-turn loop of electrically conducting material in a [[vacuum]].  The gilbert (Gb), established by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] in 1930,<ref>[http://www.iec.ch/about/history/overview/ International Electrotechnical Commission]</ref> is the [[CGS]] unit of magnetomotive force and is a slightly smaller unit than the ampere-turn. The unit is named after [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] (1544\u20131603) English physician and natural philosopher.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  1\\;\\text{Gb} &= \\frac{10}{4\\pi}\\;\\text{At} \\\\\n               &\\approx 0.795775\\;\\text{At}\n\\end{align}</math><ref>Matthew M. Radmanesh, ''The Gateway to Understanding: Electrons to Waves and Beyond'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NANN_b5hc_EC&pg=PA539&dq=gilbert p. 539], AuthorHouse, 2005 ISBN 1418487406.</ref>\n\nThe magnetomotive force can often be quickly calculated using [[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law|Amp\u00e8re's law]].  For example, the magnetomotive force <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> of long coil is:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{F} = N I</math>\n\nwhere ''N'' is the number of [[Turn (geometry)|turns]] and ''I'' is the current in the coil.  In practice this equation is used for the MMF of real [[inductor]]s with ''N'' being the [[winding number]] of the inducting coil.\n\n==Magnetic flux==\n{{Main| magnetic flux}}\n\nAn applied MMF 'drives' [[magnetic flux]] through the magnetic components of the system.  The magnetic flux through a magnetic component is proportional to the number of [[Magnetic field#Magnetic field lines|magnetic field lines]] that pass through the cross sectional area of that component. This is the ''net'' number, i.e. the number passing through in one direction, minus the number passing through in the other direction. The direction of the magnetic field vector '''''B''''' is by definition from the south to the north pole of a magnet inside the magnet; outside the field lines go from north to south.\n\nThe [[flux]] through an element of [[area]] [[perpendicular]] to the direction of magnetic field is given by the product of the [[magnetic field]] and the [[area]] element. More generally, magnetic flux \u03a6 is defined by a [[scalar product]] of the magnetic field and the area element vector.  Quantitatively, the magnetic flux through a surface ''S'' is defined as the [[integral]] of the magnetic field over the area of the surface\n\n:<math>\\Phi_m = \\int \\!\\!\\!\\! \\int_S \\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\operatorname{d}\\mathbf S</math>\n\nFor a magnetic component the area '''''S''''' used to calculate the magnetic flux \u03a6 is usually chosen to be the cross-sectional area of the component.\n\nThe [[SI]] [[unit of measurement|unit]] of magnetic flux is the [[Weber (unit)|weber]] (in derived units: volt-seconds), and the unit of magnetic field is the weber per square meter, or [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]].\n\n==Hopkinson's law: the magnetic analogy to Ohm's law==\nIn [[electronic circuits]], [[Ohm's law]] is an empirical relation between the [[electromotive force|EMF]] <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathcal{E}</math>  applied across an element and the [[current (electricity)|current]] I it generates through that element.  It is written as:\n:<math>\\mathcal{E} = IR</math>\n\nwhere ''R'' is the [[electrical resistance]] of that material.  '''Hopkinson's law''' is a counterpart to [[Ohm's law]] used in magnetic circuits.  The law is named after the British [[electrical engineer]], [[John Hopkinson]].  It states that<ref>[http://www.ginerdelosrios.org/pizarra/electronica/nemesio/pizarra_neme/simuladores/parametros_magneticos.swf Magnetism (flash)]</ref><ref>{{cite book |title= EMC Analysis Methods and Computational Models |last=Tesche |first=Fredrick|author2=Michel Ianoz |author3=Torbj\u00f6rn Karlsson |year= 1997|publisher= Wiley-IEEE|isbn=0-471-15573-X|pages=513 }}</ref>\n:<math>\\mathcal{F}=\\phi \\mathcal{R}_m</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathcal{F}</math> is the magnetomotive force (MMF) across a magnetic element, <math>\\scriptstyle \\phi</math> is the [[magnetic flux]] through the magnetic element, and <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathcal{R}_m</math> is the [[magnetic reluctance]] of that element. (It will be shown later that this relationship is due to the empirical relationship between the '''''H'''''-field and the magnetic field '''''B''''', '''''B'''''=''\u03bc'''H''''', where ''\u03bc'' is the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of the material.)  Like Ohm's law, Hopkinson's law can be interpreted either as an empirical equation that works for some materials, or it may serve as a definition of reluctance.\n\n==Reluctance==\n{{Main|Reluctance}}\n'''Magnetic reluctance''', or '''magnetic resistance''', is analogous to [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] in an [[electrical]] [[Electrical network|circuit]] (although it does not dissipate magnetic energy).  In likeness to the way an [[electric field]] causes an [[electric current]] to follow the [[path of least resistance]], a [[magnetic field]] causes [[magnetic flux]] to follow the path of least magnetic reluctance.  It is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]], \n[[Intensive and extensive properties#Extensive properties|extensive quantity]], akin to electrical resistance.\n\nThe total reluctance is equal to the ratio of the (MMF) in a passive magnetic circuit and the [[magnetic flux]] in this circuit.  In an AC field, the reluctance is the ratio of the amplitude values for a [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] MMF and magnetic flux. (see [[Phasor (sine waves)|phasors]])\n\nThe definition can be expressed as:\n:<math>\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\mathcal{F}}{\\Phi}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathcal{R}</math> is the reluctance in [[ampere-turn]]s per [[weber (unit)|weber]] (a unit that is equivalent to turns per [[henry (unit)|henry]]).\n\nMagnetic flux always forms a closed loop, as described by [[Maxwell's equations]], but the path of the loop depends on the reluctance of the surrounding materials.  It is concentrated around the path of least reluctance.  Air and vacuum have high reluctance, while easily magnetized materials such as [[soft iron]] have low reluctance. The concentration of flux in low-reluctance materials forms strong temporary poles and causes mechanical forces that tend to move the materials towards regions of higher flux so it is always an attractive force(pull).\n\nThe inverse of reluctance is called ''[[permeance]]''.\n:<math>\\mathcal{P} = \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{R}}</math>\n\nIts [[SI]] derived unit is the [[henry (unit)|henry]] (the same as the unit of [[inductance]], although the two concepts are distinct).\n\n==Microscopic origins of reluctance==\n\nThe reluctance of a magnetically uniform magnetic circuit element can be calculated as:\n:<math>\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{l}{\\mu A}</math>\n\nwhere \n:''l'' is the length of the element in [[metre]]s\n:''<math>\\scriptstyle\\mu \\;=\\; \\mu_r\\mu_0</math>'' is the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of the material (''<math>\\scriptstyle\\mu_r</math>'' is the relative permeability of the material (dimensionless), and ''<math>\\scriptstyle \\mu_0</math>'' is the permeability of free space)\n:''A'' is the cross-sectional area of the circuit in [[square metre]]s\n\nThis is similar to the equation for electrical resistance in materials, with permeability being analogous to conductivity; the reciprocal of the permeability is known as magnetic reluctivity and is analogous to resistivity.  Longer, thinner geometries with low permeabilities lead to higher reluctance.  Low reluctance, like low resistance in electric circuits, is generally preferred.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\n==Summary of analogy between magnetic circuits and electrical circuits==\n\nThe following table summarizes the mathematical analogy between electrical circuit theory and magnetic circuit theory.  This is mathematical analogy and not a physical one. Objects in the same row have the same mathematical role; the physics of the two theories are very different.  For example, current is the flow of electrical charge, while magnetic flux is '''not''' the flow of any quantity.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Analogy between 'magnetic circuits' and electrical circuits\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Magnetic !! !! colspan=3 | Electric\n|-\n!

Electric and magnetic circuits are only superficially similar because of the similarity between Hopkinson's law and Ohm's law. Magnetic circuits have significant differences, which must be taken into account in their construction: \n*Electric currents represent the flow of particles (electrons) and carry [[Power (physics)|power]], which is dissipated as heat in resistances.  Magnetic fields don't represent the \"flow\" of anything, and no power is dissipated in reluctances.\n*The current in typical electric circuits is confined to the circuit, with very little \"leakage\".  In typical magnetic circuits not all of the magnetic field is confined to the magnetic circuit; there is significant \"[[leakage flux]]\" in the space outside the magnetic cores, which must be taken into account but is difficult to calculate.\n*Most importantly, magnetic circuits are [[Nonlinear element|nonlinear]]; the reluctance in a magnetic circuit is not constant, as resistance is, but varies depending on the magnetic field.  At high magnetic fluxes the [[ferromagnetic materials]] used for the cores of magnetic circuits [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturate]], limiting the magnetic flux, so above this level the reluctance increases rapidly.  The reluctance also increases at low fluxes.  In addition, ferromagnetic materials suffer from [[hysteresis]] so the flux in them depends not just on the instantaneous MMF but also on the history of MMF.  After the source of the magnetic flux is turned off, [[remanent magnetism]] is left in ferromagnetic circuits, creating a flux with no MMF.\n\n==Circuit laws==\n[[File:Magnetischer Kreis.svg|thumb|Magnetic circuit]]\nMagnetic circuits obey other laws that are similar to electrical circuit laws. For example, the total reluctance <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathcal{R}_T</math> of reluctances <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathcal{R}_1,\\ \\mathcal{R}_2,\\ \\dots</math> in series is:\n:<math>\\mathcal{R}_T = \\mathcal{R}_1 + \\mathcal{R}_2 + \\cdots</math>\n\nThis also follows from [[Amp\u00e8re's law]] and is analogous to [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's voltage law]] for adding resistances in series. Also, the sum of magnetic fluxes <math>\\scriptstyle \\Phi_1,\\ \\Phi_2,\\ \\dots</math> into any node is always zero:\n:<math>\\Phi_1 + \\Phi_2 + \\cdots = 0</math>\n\nThis follows from [[Gauss's law for magnetism|Gauss's law]] and is analogous to [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's current law]] for analyzing electrical circuits.\n\nTogether, the three laws above form a complete system for analysing magnetic circuits, in a manner similar to electric circuits. Comparing the two types of circuits shows that:\n* The equivalent to resistance ''R'' is the ''reluctance'' <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathcal{R}_m</math>\n* The equivalent to current ''I'' is the ''magnetic flux'' ''\u03a6''\n* The equivalent to voltage ''V'' is the ''magnetomotive Force'' ''F''\n\nMagnetic circuits can be solved for the flux in each branch by application of the magnetic equivalent of [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's Voltage Law]] ([[KVL]]) for pure source/resistance circuits. Specifically, whereas KVL states that the voltage excitation applied to a loop is equal to the sum of the voltage drops (resistance times current) around the loop, the magnetic analogue states that the magnetomotive force (achieved from ampere-turn excitation) is equal to the sum of MMF drops (product of flux and reluctance) across the rest of the loop. (If there are multiple loops, the current in each branch can be solved through a matrix equation\u2014much as a matrix solution for mesh circuit branch currents is obtained in loop analysis\u2014after which the individual branch currents are obtained by adding and/or subtracting the constituent [[loop current]]s as indicated by the adopted sign convention and loop orientations.)  Per [[Amp\u00e8re's law]], the excitation is the product of the current and the number of complete loops made and is measured in ampere-turns. Stated more generally:\n\n<math>F = N\\,I = \\oint \\vec{H} \\cdot \\operatorname{d}\\vec{l}</math>\n\n(Note that, per Stokes's theorem, the closed [[line integral]] of H\u00b7dl around a contour is equal to the open [[surface integral]] of curl H\u00b7dA across the surface bounded by the closed contour. Since, from [[Maxwell's equations]], [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] H = J, the closed line integral of H\u00b7dl evaluates to the total current passing through the surface. This is equal to the excitation, NI, which also measures current passing through the surface, thereby verifying that the net current flow through a surface is zero ampere-turns in a closed system that conserves energy.)\n\nMore complex magnetic systems, where the flux is not confined to a simple loop, must be analysed from first principles by using [[Maxwell's equations]].\n\n==History==\nThe term reluctance was coined in May 1888 by [[Oliver Heaviside]].<ref>Heaviside O., Electrical Papers. Vol.2. \u2013 L.; N.Y.: Macmillan, 1892, p. 166.</ref> The notion  of \u201cmagnetic resistance\u201d was first mentioned by [[James Joule]] <ref>Joule J., Scientific Papers, vol. 1. \u2013 1884, p. 36.</ref> and the term \"[[magnetomotive force]]\u201d (MMF) was first named by Bosanquet.<ref>Bosanquet, Phil. Mag., vol. 15, 1883, p. 205.</ref> The idea for a [[magnetic flux]] law, similar to [[Ohm's law]] for closed [[electric circuit]]s, is attributed to [[Henry Augustus Rowland|H. Rowland]].<ref>Rowland H., Phil. Mag. (4), vol. 46, 1873, p. 140.</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n*Air gaps can be created in the cores of certain transformers to reduce the effects of [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturation]]. This increases the reluctance of the magnetic circuit, and enables it to store more [[energy]] before core saturation.  This effect is also used in the [[flyback transformer]].\n*Variation of reluctance is the principle behind the [[reluctance motor]] (or the variable reluctance generator) and the [[Alexanderson alternator]].\n*[[Multimedia]] [[loudspeaker]]s are typically shielded magnetically, in order to reduce magnetic interference caused to [[television]]s and other [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]s.  The speaker magnet is covered with a material such as [[soft iron]] to minimize the stray magnetic field.\n\nReluctance can also be applied to variable reluctance (magnetic) [[Pick up (music technology)|pickups]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Magnetic capacitivity]]\n* [[Magnetic capacitance]]\n* [[Magnetic complex reluctance]]\n* [[Magnetic inductive coil]]\n* [[Tokamak]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060309173902/http://www.analogzone.com/col_0909.pdf ''Magnetic-Electric Analogs'']  by Dennis L.
