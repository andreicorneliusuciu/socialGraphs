[[Frequency]] refers to the addition of time. ''Wave motion'' transfers energy from one point to another, which displace [[particles]] of the transmission medium\u2013that is, with little or no associated [[mass]] transport. Waves consist, instead, of [[oscillation]]s or [[vibration]]s (of a physical quantity), around almost fixed locations.\n\nThere are two main types of waves. [[Mechanical wave]]s propagate through a medium, and the substance of this medium is deformed. [[Restoring force]]s then reverse the deformation. For example, [[sound]] waves propagate via air molecules colliding with their neighbors. When the molecules collide, they also bounce away from each other (a restoring force). This keeps the molecules from continuing to travel in the direction of the wave.\n\nThe second main type, [[electromagnetic wave]]s, do not require a medium. Instead, they consist of periodic oscillations of electrical and magnetic fields originally generated by charged particles, and can therefore travel through a [[vacuum]]. These types vary in [[wavelength]], and include [[radio wave]]s, [[microwave]]s, [[infrared radiation]], [[visible light]], [[ultraviolet radiation]], [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s.\n\nWaves are described by a [[wave equation]] which sets out how the disturbance proceeds over time. The mathematical form of this equation varies depending on the type of wave. Further, the behavior of particles in [[quantum mechanics]] are described by waves. In addition, [[gravitational radiation|gravitational waves]] also travel through space, which are a result of a vibration or movement in gravitational fields.\n\nA wave can be [[transverse wave|transverse]], where a disturbance creates oscillations that are perpendicular to the propagation of energy transfer, or [[longitudinal wave|longitudinal]]: the oscillations are [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the direction of energy propagation. While mechanical waves can be both transverse and longitudinal, all electromagnetic waves are transverse in free space.\n\n== General features ==\n[[File:2006-01-14 Surface waves.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Surface wave]]s in [[water]] showing water ripples]]\n  \nA single, all-encompassing definition for the term ''wave'' is not straightforward. A [[vibration]] can be defined as a ''back-and-forth'' motion around a reference value. However, a vibration is not necessarily a wave.  An attempt to define the necessary and sufficient characteristics that qualify a [[phenomenon]] to be called a ''wave'' results in a fuzzy border line.\n\nThe term ''wave'' is often intuitively understood as referring to a transport of spatial disturbances that are generally not accompanied by a motion of the medium occupying this space as a whole.  In a wave, the [[energy]] of a [[vibration]] is moving away from the source in the form of a disturbance within the surrounding medium {{Harv|Hall|1980| p=8}}. However, this motion is problematic for a [[standing wave]] (for example, a wave on a string), where [[energy]] is moving in both directions equally, or for electromagnetic (e.g., light) waves in a [[vacuum]], where the concept of medium does not apply and interaction with a target is the key to wave detection and practical applications. There are [[water waves]] on the ocean surface; [[Gamma rays|gamma waves]] and [[light waves]] emitted by the Sun; [[microwaves]] used in microwave ovens and in [[radar]] equipment; [[radio waves]] broadcast by radio stations; and [[sound waves]] generated by radio receivers, telephone handsets and living creatures (as voices), to mention only a few wave phenomena.\n\nIt may appear that the description of waves is closely related to their physical origin for each specific instance of a wave process.  For example, [[acoustics]] is distinguished from [[optics]] in that sound waves are related to a mechanical rather than an electromagnetic wave transfer caused by [[vibration]].  Concepts such as [[mass]], [[momentum]], [[inertia]], or [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], become therefore crucial in describing acoustic (as distinct from optic) wave processes. This difference in origin introduces certain wave characteristics particular to the properties of the medium involved. For example, in the case of air: [[vortex|vortices]], [[radiation pressure]], [[shock waves]] etc.; in the case of solids: [[Rayleigh waves]], [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]]; and so on....\n\nOther properties, however, although usually described in terms of origin, may be generalized to all waves. For such reasons, wave theory represents a particular branch of [[physics]] that is concerned with the properties of wave processes independently of their physical origin.<ref name=Ostrovsky>\n\n{{cite book |title = Modulated waves: theory and application |url = http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0801873258 |author1=Lev A.

If all the parts making up a medium were rigidly ''bound'', then they would all vibrate as one, with no delay in the transmission of the vibration and therefore no wave motion. On the other hand, if all the parts were independent, then there would not be any transmission of the vibration and again, no wave motion. Although the above statements are meaningless in the case of waves that do not require a medium, they reveal a characteristic that is relevant to all waves regardless of origin: within a wave, the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of a vibration (that is, its position within the vibration cycle) is different for adjacent points in space because the vibration reaches these points at different times.\n\n== Mathematical description of one-dimensional waves ==\n\n=== Wave equation ===\n{{Main|Wave equation|D'Alembert's formula}}\n\nConsider a traveling [[transverse wave]] (which may be a [[pulse (physics)|pulse]]) on a string (the medium).

The red dots represent the wave [[Node (physics)|nodes]]]]\n\nA standing wave, also known as a ''stationary wave'', is a wave that remains in a constant position. This phenomenon can occur because the medium is moving in the opposite direction to the wave, or it can arise in a stationary medium as a result of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] between two waves traveling in opposite directions.\n\nThe ''sum'' of two counter-propagating waves (of equal amplitude and frequency) creates a ''standing wave''.  Standing waves commonly arise when a boundary blocks further propagation of the wave, thus causing wave reflection, and therefore introducing a counter-propagating wave.  For example, when a [[violin]] string is displaced, transverse waves propagate out to where the string is held in place at the [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]] and the [[Nut (string instrument)|nut]], where the waves are reflected back.  At the bridge and nut, the two opposed waves are in [[antiphase]] and cancel each other, producing a [[node (physics)|node]]. Halfway between two nodes there is an [[antinode]], where the two counter-propagating waves ''enhance'' each other maximally. There is no net [[Energy transfer|propagation of energy]] over time.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Standing waves on a string.gif|One-dimensional standing waves; the [[fundamental frequency|fundamental]] mode and the first 5 [[overtone]]s.\nImage:Drum vibration mode01.gif|A two-dimensional [[Vibrations of a circular drum|standing wave on a disk]]; this is the fundamental mode.\nImage:Drum vibration mode21.gif|A [[Vibrations of a circular drum|standing wave on a disk]] with two nodal lines crossing at the center; this is an overtone.\n</gallery>\n\n== Physical properties ==\n\n[[File:Light dispersion of a mercury-vapor lamp with a flint glass prism IPNr\u00b00125.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Light beam exhibiting reflection, refraction, transmission and dispersion when encountering a prism]]\n\nWaves exhibit common behaviors under a number of standard situations, e. g.\n\n=== Transmission and media ===\n{{Main|Rectilinear propagation|Transmittance|Transmission medium}}\n\nWaves normally move in a straight line (i.e. rectilinearly) through a ''[[transmission medium]]''. Such media can be classified into one or more of the following categories:\n* A ''bounded medium'' if it is finite in extent, otherwise an ''unbounded medium''\n* A ''linear medium'' if the amplitudes of different waves at any particular point in the medium can be added\n* A ''uniform medium'' or ''homogeneous medium'' if its physical properties are unchanged at different locations in space\n* An ''anisotropic medium'' if one or more of its physical properties differ in one or more directions\n* An ''isotropic medium'' if its physical properties are the ''same'' in all directions\n\n=== Absorption ===\n{{Main|Absorption (acoustics)|Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)}}\nAbsorption of waves means, if a kind of wave strikes a matter, it will be absorbed by the matter.  When a wave with that same natural frequency impinges upon an atom, then the electrons of that atom will be set into vibrational motion. If a wave of a given frequency strikes a material with electrons having the same vibrational frequencies, then those electrons will absorb the energy of the wave and transform it into vibrational motion.\n\n=== Reflection ===\n{{Main|Reflection (physics)}}\n\nWhen a wave strikes a reflective surface, it changes direction, such that the angle made by the [[incident ray|incident wave]] and line [[perpendicular|normal]] to the surface equals the angle made by the reflected wave and the same normal line.\n\n=== Interference ===\n{{Main|Interference (wave propagation)}}\n\nWaves that encounter each other combine through [[superposition principle|superposition]] to create a new wave called an [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference pattern]]. Important interference patterns occur for waves that are in [[phase (waves)|phase]].\n\n=== Refraction ===\n{{Main|Refraction}}\n\n[[File:Wave refraction.gif|thumb|right|200 px|Sinusoidal traveling plane wave entering a region of lower wave velocity at an angle, illustrating the decrease in wavelength and change of direction (refraction) that results.]]\n\nRefraction is the phenomenon of a wave changing its speed. Mathematically, this means that the size of the [[phase velocity]] changes. Typically, refraction occurs when a wave passes from one [[Transmission medium|medium]] into another. The amount by which a wave is refracted by a material is given by the [[refractive index]] of the material. The directions of incidence and refraction are related to the refractive indices of the two materials by [[Snell's law]].\n\n=== Diffraction ===\n{{Main|Diffraction}}\n\nA wave exhibits diffraction when it encounters an obstacle that bends the wave or when it spreads after emerging from an opening. Diffraction effects are more pronounced when the size of the obstacle or opening is comparable to the wavelength of the wave.\n\n=== Polarization ===\n{{Main|Polarization (waves)}}\n\n[[File:Circular.Polarization.Circularly.Polarized.Light Circular.Polarizer Creating.Left.Handed.Helix.View.svg|thumb|left]]\n\nThe phenomenon of polarization arises when wave motion can occur simultaneously in two [[orthogonal]] directions. [[Transverse wave]]s can be polarized, for instance. When polarization is used as a descriptor without qualification, it usually refers to the special, simple case of [[linear polarization]]. A transverse wave is linearly polarized if it oscillates in only one direction or plane. In the case of linear polarization. it is often useful to add the relative orientation of that plane, perpendicular to the direction of travel, in which the oscillation occurs, such as \"horizontal\" for instance, if the plane of polarization is parallel to the ground. [[Electromagnetic waves]] propagating in free space, for instance, are transverse; they can be polarized by the use of a [[polarizer|polarizing filter]].\n\nLongitudinal waves, such as sound waves, do not exhibit polarization. For these waves there is only one direction of oscillation, that is, along the direction of travel.\n\n=== Dispersion ===\n\n[[File:Light dispersion conceptual waves.gif|thumb|right|270 px|Schematic of light being dispersed by a prism.

An electromagnetic wave travels in a direction that is at right angles to the oscillation direction of both fields. In the 19th century, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] showed that, in [[vacuum]], the electric and magnetic fields satisfy the [[wave equation]] both with speed equal to that of the [[speed of light]]. From this emerged the idea that [[visible light|light]] is an electromagnetic wave. Electromagnetic waves can have different frequencies (and thus wavelengths), giving rise to various types of radiation such as [[radio waves]], [[microwaves]], [[infrared]], visible light, [[ultraviolet]], [[X-rays]], and [[Gamma rays]].\n\n== Quantum mechanical waves ==\n{{Main|Schr\u00f6dinger equation}}\n{{See also|Wave function}}\n\n=== Schr\u00f6dinger equation ===\nThe [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] describes the wave-like behavior of particles in [[quantum mechanics]].

Dirac waves accounted for the fine details of the hydrogen spectrum in a completely rigorous way.  The wave equation also implied the existence of a new form of matter, antimatter, previously unsuspected and unobserved and which was experimentally confirmed.  In the context of quantum field theory, the Dirac equation is reinterpreted to describe quantum fields corresponding to spin-\u00bd particles.\n\n[[File:Wave packet (dispersion).gif|thumb|A propagating wave packet; in general, the ''envelope'' of the wave packet moves at a different speed than the constituent waves.<ref name=Fromhold>{{cite book |title = Quantum Mechanics for Applied Physics and Engineering |author = A.

This hypothesis was at the basis of [[quantum mechanics]]. Nowadays, this wavelength is called the [[de Broglie wavelength]]. For example, the [[electron]]s in a [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] display have a de Broglie wavelength of about 10<sup>\u221213</sup> m.'''\n\nA wave representing such a particle traveling in the ''k''-direction is expressed by the wave function as follows:\n\n:<math>\\psi (\\mathbf{r}, \\ t=0) =A\\  e^{i\\mathbf{k \\cdot r}} \\ , </math>\n\nwhere the wavelength is determined by the [[wave vector]] '''k''' as:\n\n:<math> \\lambda = \\frac {2 \\pi}{k} \\ , </math>\n\nand the momentum by:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{p} = \\hbar \\mathbf{k} \\ . </math>\n\nHowever, a wave like this with definite wavelength is not localized in space, and so cannot represent a particle localized in space.
