Porter, Inc.]] No. 3290 of 1923.]]\n\n'''Pneumatics''' (From Greek: ''\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03bc\u03b1'') is a branch of [[engineering]] that makes use of gas or [[pressurized air]].\n\nPneumatic systems used extensively in [[industry]] are commonly powered by [[compressed air]] or compressed [[inert gases]]. A centrally located and electrically powered [[Gas compressor|compressor]] powers [[Pneumatic cylinder|cylinders]], [[air motor]]s,  and other pneumatic devices.  A pneumatic system controlled through manual or automatic [[solenoid valve]]s is selected when it provides a lower cost, more flexible, or safer alternative to [[electric motor]]s and [[actuator]]s.\n\nPneumatics also has applications in [[dentistry]], [[construction]], [[mining]], and other areas.\n\n==Examples of pneumatic systems and components==\n{{colbegin|2}}\n*[[Air brake (road vehicle)|Air brakes]] on [[bus]]es and [[truck]]s\n*[[Railway air brake|Air brakes]] on [[train]]s\n*[[Gas compressor|Air compressors]]\n*[[Air engine]]s for pneumatically powered vehicles\n*[[Barostat]] systems used in [[Neurogastroenterology]] and for researching electricity\n*[[Cable jetting]], a way to install cables in ducts\n*[[Dental drill]]\n*[[Compressed-air engine]] and [[compressed-air vehicle]]s\n*[[Gas-operated reloading]]\n*[[Holman Projector]], a pneumatic anti-aircraft weapon\n*[[HVAC control system]]s\n*[[Inflatable structure]]s\n*[[Lego pneumatics]] can be used to build pneumatic models\n*[[Pipe organ]]\n**[[Electro-pneumatic action]] \n**[[Tubular-pneumatic action]]\n*[[Player piano]]\n*[[Pneumatic actuator]]\n*[[Air gun#Pneumatic|Pneumatic air guns]]\n*[[Pneumatic bladder]]\n*[[Pneumatic cylinder]]\n*[[Pneumatic comparator]]\n*[[Spud Gun|Pneumatic Launchers]], a type of spud gun\n*[[Pneumatic tube#Pneumatic post|Pneumatic mail systems]]\n*[[Pneumatic motor]]\n*[[Pneumatic tire]]\n*[[Pneumatic tool]]s:\n**[[Jackhammer]] used by road workers\n**[[Nailgun|Pneumatic nailgun]]\n*[[Pressure regulator]]\n*[[Pressure sensor]]\n*[[Pressure switch]]\n*[[Vacuum pump]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Gases used in pneumatic systems==\nPneumatic systems in fixed installations, such as factories, use compressed air because a sustainable supply can be made by compressing atmospheric air. The air usually has moisture removed, and a small quantity of oil is added at the compressor to prevent corrosion and lubricate mechanical components.\n\nFactory-plumbed pneumatic-power users need not worry about poisonous leakage, as the gas is usually just air. Smaller or stand-alone systems can use other compressed gases that present an [[asphyxiation]] hazard, such as [[nitrogen]]\u2014often referred to as [[Nitrogen#Applications|OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen)]] when supplied in cylinders.\n\nAny compressed gas other than air is an asphyxiation hazard\u2014including nitrogen, which makes up 78% of air. Compressed [[oxygen]] (approx. 21% of air) would not asphyxiate, but is not used in pneumatically-powered devices because it is a fire hazard, more expensive, and offers no performance advantage over air.\n\nPortable pneumatic tools and small vehicles, such as [[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]] machines and other hobbyist applications are often powered by compressed [[carbon dioxide]], because containers designed to hold it such as [[soda stream]] canisters and fire extinguishers are readily available, and the [[Carbon dioxide#Uses|phase change]] between liquid and gas makes it possible to obtain a larger volume of compressed gas from a lighter container than compressed air requires. Carbon dioxide is an asphyxiant and can be a freezing hazard if vented improperly.\n\n==History==\nThe origins of pneumatics can be traced back to the first century when ancient Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria wrote about his inventions powered by steam or the wind.\n\nGerman physicist Otto von Guericke (1602 to 1686) went a little further. He invented the vacuum pump, a device that can draw out air or gas from the attached vessel. He demonstrated the vacuum pump to separate the pairs of copper hemispheres using air pressures. The field of pneumatics has changed considerably over the years. It has moved from small handheld devices to large machines with multiple parts that serve different functions.\n\n==Comparison to hydraulics==\nBoth pneumatics and [[hydraulics]] are applications of [[fluid power]]. Pneumatics uses an easily compressible gas such as air or a suitable pure gas\u2014while hydraulics uses relatively incompressible liquid media such as oil. Most industrial pneumatic applications use pressures of about {{Convert|80|to|100|psi|kPa|lk=on}}. Hydraulics applications commonly use from {{Convert|1000|to|5000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}, but specialized applications may exceed {{Convert|10000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}. {{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n===Advantages of pneumatics===\n*''Simplicity of design and control''\u2014Machines are easily designed using standard cylinders and other components, and operate via simple on-off control.\n*''Reliability''\u2014Pneumatic systems generally have long operating lives and require little maintenance. Because gas is compressible, equipment is less subject to shock damage. Gas absorbs excessive force, whereas fluid in hydraulics directly transfers force. Compressed gas can be stored, so machines still run for a while if electrical power is lost.\n*''Safety''\u2014There is a very low chance of fire compared to hydraulic oil. Newer machines are usually overload safe.\n\n===Advantages of hydraulics===\n* Liquid  does not absorb any of the supplied energy.\n* Capable of moving much higher loads and providing much higher forces due to the incompressibility.\n* The hydraulic working fluid is basically incompressible, leading to a minimum of [[Spring (device)|spring]] action. When [[hydraulic fluid]] flow is stopped, the slightest motion of the load releases the pressure on the load; there is no need to \"bleed off\" pressurized air to release the pressure on the load.\n* Highly responsive compared to pneumatics.\n* Supply more power than pneumatics.\n* Can also do many purposes at one time: lubrication, cooling and power transmission.\n\n==Pneumatic logic==\n{{further|Pneumatic circuit}}\nPneumatic logic systems (sometimes called '''air logic control''') are sometimes used for controlling industrial processes, consisting of primary logic units like:\n\n*[[Logical conjunction|And]] Units\n*[[Logical disjunction|Or]] Units\n*'Relay or Booster' Units\n*Latching Units\n*'Timer' Units\n* [[Sorteberg relay]]\n* [[Fluidics]] amplifiers with no moving parts other than the air itself\n\nPneumatic logic is a reliable and functional control method for industrial processes. In recent years, these systems have largely been replaced by electronic control systems in new installations because of the smaller size, lower cost, greater precision, and more powerful features of digital controls. Pneumatic devices are still used where upgrade cost, or safety factors dominate.<ref>{{cite web|last=KMC Controls|title=Pneumatic to Digital: Open System Conversions|url=http://www.kmccontrols.com/images/agiods_files/downloads/Pneumatics_Digital_Conversion_White_Paper.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Compressed air]]\n*[[Ozone cracking]] - can affect pneumatic seals\n<!-- no mention of pneumatics: *[[Polymer degradation]] -->\n*[[Pneudraulics]]\n*[[History of pneumatic power]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Brian S.
