It also encompasses the fields of [[robotics]] and [[neuroscience]]. Biomechatronic devices encompass a wide range of applications from the development of [[Prosthesis|prosthetic limbs]] to engineering solutions concerning respiration, vision, and the cardiovascular system.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Biomechatronics|last=Brooker|first=Graham|publisher=University of Sydney, Australia|year=2012|isbn=978-1-891121-27-2|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==How it works==\nBiomechatronics mimics how the human body works. For example, four different steps must occur to be able to lift the foot to walk. First, [[Action potential|impulses]] from the motor center of the [[brain]] are sent to the foot and [[leg muscles]]. Next the [[nerve cells]] in the feet send information, providing feedback to the brain, enabling it to adjust the [[muscle]] groups or amount of [[force]] required to walk across the ground. Different amounts of [[force]] are applied depending on the type of surface being walked across. The leg's [[muscle spindle]] [[nerve cells]] then sense and send the position of the floor back up to the [[brain]]. Finally, when the foot is raised to step, signals are sent to [[muscles]] in the leg and foot to set it down.\n\n===Biosensors===\n[[Biosensors]] are used to detect what the user wants to do or their intentions and motions. In some devices the information can be relayed by the user's [[nervous system]] or [[muscle system]]. This information is related by the biosensor to a [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] which can be located inside or outside the biomechatronic device. In addition biosensors receive information about the [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] position and force from the [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]] and [[actuator]]. Biosensors come in a variety of forms. They can be [[wire]]s which detect [[electrical activity]], [[needle electrodes]] implanted in [[muscles]], and [[electrode array]]s with [[nerves]] growing through them.\n\n===Mechanical sensors===\nThe purpose of the mechanical sensors is to measure information about the biomechatronic device and relate that information to the biosensor or controller.\n\n===Controller===\nThe controller in a biomechatronic device relays the user's intentions to the actuators. It also interprets feedback information to the user that comes from the biosensors and mechanical sensors. The other function of the controller is to control the biomechatronic device's movements.\n\n===Actuator===\nThe actuator is an artificial muscle. Its job is to produce force and movement. Depending on whether the device is [[orthotic]] or [[prosthetic]] the actuator can be a motor that assists or replaces the user's original muscle.\n\n==Research==\nBiomechatronics is a rapidly growing field but as of now there are very few labs which conduct research. The [[Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago]], [[University of California at Berkeley]], [[MIT]], and [[University of Twente]] in the Netherlands are the researching leaders in biomechatronics. Three main areas are emphasized in the current research.\n#Analyzing human motions, which are complex, to aid in the design of biomechatronic devices\n#Studying how electronic devices can be interfaced with the nervous system. \n#Testing the ways to use living muscle tissue as actuators for electronic devices\n\n===Analyzing motions===\nA great deal of analysis over human motion is needed because human movement is very complex. [[MIT]] and the [[University of Twente]] are both working to analyze these movements. They are doing this through a combination of [[computer models]], [[camera]] systems, and [[electromyograms]].\n\n===Interfacing===\nInterfacing allows biomechatronic devices to connect with the muscle systems and nerves of the user in order send and receive information from the device. This is a technology that is not available in ordinary [[orthotics]] and [[prosthetics]] devices. Groups at the [[University of Twente]] are making drastic steps in this department. Scientists there have developed a device which will help to treat [[paralysis]] and [[stroke]] victims who are unable to control their foot while walking. The researchers are also nearing a breakthrough which would allow a person with an [[amputated]] leg to control their [[prosthetic]] leg through their stump muscles.\n\n===MIT research===\n[[Hugh Herr]] is the leading biomechatronic scientist at [[MIT]]. Herr and his group of researchers are developing a [[sieve]] [[integrated circuit]] [[electrode]] and prosthetic devices that are coming closer to mimicking real human movement. The two prosthetic devices currently in the making will control knee movement and the other will control the stiffness of an ankle joint.\n\n====Robotic fish====\nAs mentioned before Herr and his colleagues made a robotic fish that was propelled by living muscle tissue taken from frog legs. The robotic fish was a prototype of a biomechatronic device with a living actuator. The following characteristics were given to the fish.<ref name=\" How Biomechatronics Works \">{{cite web|url= http://science.howstuffworks.com/biomechatronics4.htm|title= How Biomechatronics Works|work=HowStuffWorks|author=Craig Freudenrich|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> \n* A styrofoam float so the fish can float\n* Electrical wires for connections\n* A silicone tail that enables force while swimming\n* Power provided by lithium batteries\n* A microcontroller to control movement\n* An infrared sensor enables the microcontroller to communicate with a handheld device\n* Muscles stimulated by an electronic unit\n\n===Arts research===\nNew media artists at UCSD are using biomechatronics in performance art pieces, such as Technesexual ([http://bang.calit2.net/wiki/Mixed_Relations more information], [https://secure.flickr.com/photos/lotu5/sets/72157621943139937/ photos], [http://www.vimeo.com/7240418 video]), a performance which uses biometric sensors to bridge the performers' real bodies to their Second Life avatars and Slapshock  ([http://life.calit2.net/archives/2009/06/slapshock-by-elle-mehrmand-and.php more information], [https://secure.flickr.com/photos/lotu5/sets/72157620312879150/ photos],[http://www.vimeo.com/5532433 video]), in which medical TENS units are used to explore intersubjective symbiosis in intimate relationships.\n\n==Growth==\nThe demand for biomechatronic devices are at an all-time high and show no signs of slowing down. With increasing technological advancement in recent years, biomechatronic researchers have been able to construct prosthetic limbs that are capable of replicating the functionality of human appendages. Such devices include the \"i-limb\", developed by prosthetic company Touch Bionics, the first fully functioning prosthetic hand with articulating joints,<ref>{{cite web|title=Touch Bionics|url=http://www.touchbionics.com/about/history|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> as well as Herr's PowerFoot BiOM, the first prosthetic leg capable of simulating muscle and tendon processes within the human body.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/future-robotic-legs-180953040/?no-ist=&preview=&page=1|title=Is This the Future of Robotic Legs?|author=Shaer, Matthew|date=November 2014|magazine=Smithsonian Magazine }}</ref>  Biomechatronic research has also helped further research towards understanding human functions. Researchers from Carnegie Mellon and North Carolina State have created an exoskeleton that decreases the metabolic cost of walking by around 7 percent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Researchers improve efficiency of human walking|type=Press Release|publisher=NSF|url=http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=134667|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nMany biomechatronic researchers are closely collaborating with military organizations. The [[US Department of Veterans Affairs]] and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] are giving funds to different labs to help soldiers and war veterans.<ref name=\" How Biomechatronics Works \"/>\n\nDespite the demand, however, biomechatronic technologies struggle within the healthcare market due to high costs and lack of implementation into insurance policies. Herr claims that Medicare and Medicaid specifically are important \"market-breakers or market-makers for all these technologies,\" and that the technologies will not be available to everyone until the technologies get a breakthrough.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.betaboston.com/news/2014/04/22/will-medicare-patients-be-left-out-of-the-bionics-revolution/|title=Will Medicare patients be left out of the bionics revolution?|author=Johnson, Brian|work=Boston Globe|date=2014-04-22|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> Biomechatronic devices, although improved, also still face mechanical obstructions, suffering from inadequate battery power, consistent mechanical reliability, and neural connections between prosthetics and the human body.<ref>{{cite web|title=How biomechatronic prosthetics are changing the face of disability|date=March 13, 2014|url=http://www.eurekamagazine.co.uk/design-engineering-features/technology/how-biomechatronic-prosthetics-are-changing-the-face-of-disability/60092/|accessdate=July 29, 2016|author=Fanning, Paul|work=Eureka Magazine}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|3}}\n* [[Biomechanics]]\n* [[Biomedical engineering]]\n* [[Bionics]]\n* [[Brain\u2013computer interface]]\n* [[Cybernetics]]\n* [[Cyberware]]\n* [[Gerontechnology]]\n* [[Mechatronics]]\n* [[Neural engineering]]\n* [[Neuroprosthetics]]\n* [[Orthotics]]\n* [[Prosthetics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n<!-- Er.
