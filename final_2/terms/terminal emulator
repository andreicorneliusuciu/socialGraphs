Though typically synonymous with a [[command line interpreter|shell]] or [[text terminal]], the term ''terminal'' covers all remote terminals, including graphical interfaces. A terminal emulator inside a [[graphical user interface]] is often called a '''terminal window'''.\n\nA terminal window allows the user access to a text terminal and all its applications such as [[command-line interface]]s (CLI) and [[text user interface]] (TUI) applications. These may be running either on the same machine or on a different one via [[telnet]], [[Secure Shell|ssh]], or [[dial-up]]. On [[Unix-like]] operating systems, it is common to have one or more terminal windows connected to the local machine.\n\nTerminals usually support a set of [[escape sequences]] for controlling color, [[Cursor (computers)|cursor]] position, etc. Examples include the family of terminal control sequence standards known as [[ECMA-48]], [[ANSI X3.64]] or [[ISO/IEC 6429]].\n\n== Local echo ==\n{{main|echo (computing)#Terminal emulators}}\n\nTerminal emulators may implement a [[echo (computing)|local echo]] function, which may be erroneously named \"half-duplex\" (see [[Duplex (telecommunications)]] for information on half-duplex), or still slightly incorrectly \"echoplex\" (which is formally an [[error detection]] mechanism rather than an input display option).{{sfn|Daintith|2004|p=171}}{{sfn|Weik|2000|loc=\"echo\" p. 478}}{{sfn|Weik|2000|loc=\"echoplex\" p.479}}{{sfn|Weik|2000|loc=\"echoplex mode\" p. 479}}\n\n== Line-at-a-time mode/Local editing ==\n{{main|Computer terminal#Modes}}\n\nTerminal emulators may implement local editing, also known as \"line-at-a-time mode\". This is also mistakenly referred to as \"half-duplex\". In this mode, the terminal emulator only sends complete lines of input to the host system. The user enters and edits a line, but it is held locally within the terminal emulator as it is being edited and not transmitted until the user signals (usually with the {{keypress|Enter}} key on the keyboard or a \"send\" button of some sort on the user interface) the completion of the line. At that point the entire line is transmitted. Line-at-a-time mode implies local echo, since otherwise the user will not be able to see the line as it is being edited and constructed.{{sfn|Daintith|2004|p=171}}{{sfn|Bangia|2010|p=324}}  However, line-at-a-time mode is independent of echo mode and does not ''require'' local echo.  When entering a password, for example, line-at-a-time entry with local editing is possible, but local echo is turned off (otherwise the password would be displayed).{{sfn|Stevens|Wright|1994|p=413}}\n\nThe complexities of line-at-a-time mode are exemplified by the line-at-a-time mode option in the telnet protocol. To implement it correctly, the ''Network Virtual Terminal'' implementation provided by the terminal emulator program must be capable of recognizing and properly dealing with \"interrupt\" and \"abort\" events that arrive in the middle of locally editing a line.{{sfn|Miller|2009|p=590, 591}}\n\n== Synchronous terminals ==\n{{original research|section|date=January 2011}}\n\nIn asynchronous terminals data can flow in any direction at any time.  In '''synchronous terminals''' a protocol controls who may send data when. [[IBM 3270]]-based terminals used with [[IBM]] mainframe computers are an example of '''synchronous terminals'''. They operate in an essentially \"screen-at-a-time\" mode (also known as [[Block-oriented terminal|block mode]]). Users can make numerous changes to a page, before submitting the updated screen to the remote machine as a single action.\n\nTerminal emulators that simulate the 3270 protocol are available for most operating systems, for use both by those administering systems such as the [[System z9|z9]], as well as those using the corresponding applications such as [[CICS]].\n\nOther examples of synchronous terminals include the [[IBM 5250]], [[International Computers Limited|ICL]] 7561, [[Honeywell Bull]] VIP7800 and [[Hewlett-Packard]] 700/92.\n\n== Examples of terminals emulated ==\n\nMany terminal emulators have been developed for terminals such as [[VT100]], [[VT220]], [[VT320]], [[IBM 3270|IBM 3270/8/9/E]], [[IBM 5250]], [[IBM 3179G]], [[Data General]] D211, [[Hewlett Packard]] HP700/92, Sperry/Unisys 2000-series [[Uniscope|UTS60]], Burroughs/Unisys A-series  T27/TD830/ET1100, [[Applied Digital Data Systems|ADDS]] ViewPoint, [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] console, [[QNX]], AT386, SCO-ANSI, SNI 97801, [[Televideo]], and [[Wyse]] 50/60. Additionally, programs have been developed to emulate other terminal emulators such as [[xterm]] and assorted console terminals (e.g., for [[Linux]]). Finally, some emulations simply refer to a standard, such as [[ANSI escape code|ANSI]]. Such programs are available on many platforms ranging from [[DOS]] and [[Unix]] to [[GUI]] operating systems such as [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]], to embedded operating systems found in cellphones and industrial hardware.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Binary Synchronous Communications]]\n* [[List of terminal emulators]]\n* [[Online service provider]]\n* [[Serial interface]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite encyclopaedia | ref = harv | encyclopedia = Dictionary of Information Technology | article = line mode terminal | first = Ramesh | last = Bangia | publisher = Laxmi Publications, Ltd | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-93-8029-815-3 }}\n* {{cite encyclopaedia | ref = harv | encyclopedia = Oxford dictionary of computing | article = echo | first = John | last = Daintith | edition = 5th | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-19-860877-6 }}\n* {{cite book | ref = harv | title = TCP/IP&nbsp;\u2013 The Ultimate Protocol Guide | volume = 2&nbsp;\u2013 Applications, Access and Data Security | first = Philip M. | last = Miller | publisher = Universal-Publishers | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-59942-493-4 }}\n* {{cite book | ref = harv | title = TCP/IP illustrated|volume = 1: The protocols | series = Addison-Wesley professional computing series | first1 = W.
