An example of a chassis is the underpart of a [[motor vehicle]], consisting of the frame (on which the body is mounted). If the [[running gear]] such as wheels and transmission, and sometimes even the driver's seat, are included, then the assembly is described as a [[rolling chassis]].\n\n==Examples of use==\n===Vehicles===\n{{See also|Rolling chassis}}\n[[File:Jeep FC-160 CowlAndChassis.jpg|thumb|right|1950s [[Jeep FC]] [[Cowling|cowl]] and chassis for others to convert into finished vehicles]]\nIn the case of vehicles, the term [[rolling chassis]] means the [[frame (vehicle)|frame]] plus the \"running gear\" like [[engine]], [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], [[drive shaft]], [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]], and [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]].\n\nAn under body (sometimes referred to as \"[[coachwork]]\"), which is usually not necessary for integrity of the structure, is built on the chassis to complete the vehicle.\n\nFor [[commercial vehicle]]s, a [[rolling chassis]] consists of an assembly of all the essential parts of a truck (without the body) to be ready for operation on the road.<ref>{{cite book|title=Official Handbook of Automobiles|year=1922|publisher=National Automobile Association|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pjRuEBUi9f0C&pg=PA180&dq=NACC+definition+of+standard+chassis+commercial#v=onepage&q=NACC%20definition%20of%20standard%20chassis%20commercial&f=false|author=Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers (U.S.)|accessdate=10 September 2010|page=180|oclc=6360726}}</ref> The design of a pleasure car chassis will be different than one for commercial vehicles because of the heavier loads and constant work use.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sturmey|first=Henry|journal=Commercial Motor|title=The Use of Unsuitable Vehicles|volume=7|issue=160|date=2 April 1908|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8oDnAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA146&dq=Chassis+only+commercial+vehicle#v=onepage&q=Chassis%20only%20commercial%20vehicle&f=false|accessdate=10 September 2010|pages=146\u2013147}}</ref> Commercial vehicle manufacturers sell \"chassis only\", \"cowl and chassis\", as well as \"[[chassis cab]]\" versions that can be outfitted with specialized bodies.
