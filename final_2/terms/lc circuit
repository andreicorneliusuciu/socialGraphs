The circuit can act as an electrical [[resonator]], an electrical analogue of a [[tuning fork]], storing energy oscillating at the circuit's [[resonant frequency]].\n\nLC circuits are used either for generating signals at a particular frequency, or picking out a signal at a particular frequency from a more complex signal. They are key components in many electronic devices, particularly radio equipment, used in circuits such as [[Electronic oscillator|oscillators]], [[Electronic filter|filters]], [[Tuner (electronics)|tuners]] and [[frequency mixer]]s.\n\nAn LC circuit is an idealized model since it assumes there is no dissipation of energy due to [[electrical resistance|resistance]]. Any practical implementation of an LC circuit will always include loss resulting from small but non-zero resistance within the components and connecting wires. The purpose of an LC circuit is usually to oscillate with minimal [[damping]], so the resistance is made as low as possible. While no practical circuit is without losses, it is nonetheless instructive to study this ideal form of the circuit to gain understanding and physical intuition. For a circuit model incorporating resistance, see [[RLC circuit]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe two-element LC circuit described above is the simplest type of '''inductor-capacitor network''' (or '''LC network'''). It is also referred to as a ''second order LC circuit'' to distinguish it from more complicated (higher order) LC networks with more inductors and capacitors. Such LC networks with more than two reactances may have more than one [[resonant frequency]].\n\nThe order of the network is the order of the [[rational function]] describing the network in the [[complex frequency]] variable {{mvar|s}}. Generally, the order is equal to the number of L and C elements in the circuit and in any event cannot exceed this number.\n\n==Operation==\n[[Image:Tuned circuit animation 3 300ms.gif|thumb|Animated diagram showing the operation of a [[tuned circuit]] (LC circuit). The capacitor C stores energy in its [[electric field]] {{mvar|E}} and the inductor L stores energy in its [[magnetic field]] {{mvar|B}} ''(<span style=\"color:green;\">green</span>)''. This jerky animation shows \"snapshots\" of the circuit at progressive points in the oscillation. The oscillations are slowed down; in an actual tuned circuit the charge oscillates back and forth tens of thousands to billions of times per second.]]\n\nAn LC circuit, oscillating at its natural [[resonant frequency]], can store [[electrical energy]]. See the animation at right. A capacitor stores energy in the [[electric field]] ({{mvar|E}}) between its plates, depending on the [[voltage]] across it, and an inductor stores energy in its [[magnetic field]] ({{mvar|B}}), depending on the [[Electric current|current]] through it.\n\nIf an inductor is connected across a charged capacitor, current will start to flow through the inductor, building up a magnetic field around it and reducing the voltage on the capacitor. Eventually all the charge on the capacitor will be gone and the voltage across it will reach zero. However, the current will continue, because inductors resist changes in current. The current will begin to charge the capacitor with a voltage of opposite polarity to its original charge. Due to [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]], the [[electromotive force|EMF]] which drives the current is caused by a decrease in the magnetic field, thus the energy required to charge the capacitor is extracted from the magnetic field. When the magnetic field is completely dissipated the current will stop and the charge will again be stored in the capacitor, with the opposite polarity as before. Then the cycle will begin again, with the current flowing in the opposite direction through the inductor.\n\nThe charge flows back and forth between the plates of the capacitor, through the inductor. The energy oscillates back and forth between the capacitor and the inductor until (if not replenished from an external circuit) internal [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] makes the oscillations die out. In most applications the tuned circuit is part of a larger circuit which applies [[alternating current]] to it, driving continuous oscillations. If these are at the natural oscillatory frequency ([[Natural frequency]]), [[resonance]] will occur. The tuned circuit's action, known mathematically as a [[harmonic oscillator]], is similar to a [[pendulum]] swinging back and forth, or water sloshing back and forth in a tank; for this reason the circuit is also called a ''tank circuit''.<ref name=\"Rao\">{{cite book\n | last1 = Rao\n | first1 = B.

In typical tuned circuits in electronic equipment the oscillations are very fast, thousands to billions of times per second.\n\n== Resonance effect ==\n[[Resonance]] occurs when an LC circuit is driven from an external source at an angular frequency {{math|''\u03c9''<sub>0</sub>}} at which the inductive and capacitive [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]]s are equal in magnitude. The frequency at which this equality holds for the particular circuit is called the resonant frequency. The [[Electrical resonance|resonant frequency]] of the LC circuit is\n\n:<math>\\omega_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{LC}}</math>\nwhere {{mvar|L}} is the [[inductance]] in [[Henry (unit)|henrys]], and {{mvar|C}} is the [[capacitance]] in [[farad]]s. The [[angular frequency]] {{math|''\u03c9''<sub>0</sub>}} has units of [[radian]]s per second.\n\nThe equivalent frequency in units of [[hertz]] is\n\n:<math>f_0 = \\frac{ \\omega_0 }{ 2 \\pi } = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sqrt{LC}}. </math>\n\nLC circuits are often used as filters; the {{mvar|{{sfrac|L|C}}}} ratio is one of the factors that determines their [[Q factor|\"{{mvar|Q}}\"]] and so [[electronic selectivity|selectivity]]. For a series resonant circuit with a given resistance, the higher the inductance and the lower the capacitance, the narrower the filter [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]. For a parallel resonant circuit the opposite applies. Positive feedback around the [[tuned circuit]] (\"regeneration\") can also increase selectivity (see [[positive feedback|{{mvar|Q}} multiplier]] and [[Regenerative circuit]]).\n\n[[Stagger tuning]] can provide an acceptably wide audio bandwidth, yet good selectivity.\n\n== Applications ==\n\nThe resonance effect of the LC circuit has many important applications in signal processing and communications systems.\n* The most common application of tank circuits is '''tuning''' radio transmitters and receivers. For example, when we tune a radio to a particular station, the LC circuits are set at resonance for that particular [[carrier frequency]].\n* A series resonant circuit provides '''voltage magnification'''.\n* A parallel resonant circuit provides '''current magnification'''.\n* A parallel resonant circuit can be used as load impedance in output circuits of RF amplifiers. Due to high impedance, the gain of amplifier is maximum at resonant frequency.\n* Both parallel and series resonant circuits are used in [[induction heating]].\n\nLC circuits behave as electronic [[resonators]], which are a key component in many applications:\n*[[Electronic amplifier|Amplifiers]]\n*[[Electronic oscillator|Oscillators]]\n*[[electronic filter|Filters]]\n*[[Tuner (electronics)|Tuners]]\n*[[Frequency mixer|Mixers]]\n*[[Foster-Seeley discriminator]]\n*[[Contactless smart card|Contactless cards]]\n*[[Graphics tablet]]s\n*[[Electronic article surveillance]] (security tags)\n\n== Time domain solution ==\n\n=== Kirchhoff's laws ===\nBy [[Kirchhoff's voltage law]], the voltage across the capacitor, {{mvar|V<sub>C</sub>}}, plus the voltage across the inductor, {{mvar|V<sub>L</sub>}} must equal zero:\n\n:<math>V_C + V_L = 0\\,.</math>\n\nLikewise, by [[Kirchhoff's current law]], the current through the capacitor equals the current through the inductor:\n\n:<math>I_C = I_L \\,.</math>\n\nFrom the constitutive relations for the circuit elements, we also know that\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} V_L(t) &= L \\frac{dI_L}{dt}\\,, \\\\\nI_C(t) &= C \\frac{dV_C}{dt}\\,. \\end{align}</math>\n\n=== Differential equation ===\nRearranging and substituting gives the second order [[differential equation]]\n\n:<math>\\frac{d^2}{dt^2}I(t) + \\frac{1}{LC} I(t) = 0\\,.</math>\n\nThe parameter {{math|''\u03c9''<sub>0</sub>}}, the resonant [[angular frequency]], is defined as:\n\n:<math>\\omega_0 = \\frac{1}\\sqrt{LC}\\,.</math>\n\nUsing this can simplify the differential equation\n\n:<math>\\frac{d^2}{dt^2}I(t) + \\omega_0^2 I(t) = 0\\,.</math>\n\nThe associated polynomial is\n\n:<math>s^2 + \\omega_0^2 = 0\\,;</math>\n\nthus,\n\n:<math>s = \\pm j \\omega_0\\,,</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|j}} is the [[imaginary unit]].\n\n=== Solution ===\nThus, the complete solution to the differential equation is\n\n:<math>I(t) = Ae^{+j \\omega_0 t} + Be^{-j \\omega_0 t}\\,</math>\n\nand can be solved for {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} by considering the initial conditions. Since the exponential is [[complex numbers|complex]], the solution represents a sinusoidal [[alternating current]]. Since the electric current {{mvar|I}} is a physical quantity, it must be real-valued. As a result, it can be shown that the constants {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} must be [[complex conjugate]]s:\n\n:<math>A = B^*</math>\n\nNow, let\n\n:<math> A = \\frac{ I_0 }{ 2 } e^{ +j \\phi } </math>\n\nTherefore,\n\n:<math> B = \\frac{ I_0 }{ 2 } e^{ -j \\phi } </math>\n\nNext, we can use [[Euler's formula]] to obtain a real [[Sine wave|sinusoid]] with [[amplitude]] {{math|''I''<sub>0</sub>}}, [[angular frequency]] {{math|''\u03c9''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|1|{{sqrt|''LC''}}}}}}, and [[Phase (waves)|phase angle]] {{mvar|\u03c6}}.\n\nThus, the resulting solution becomes:\n\n:<math>I(t) = I_0 \\cos\\left(\\omega_0 t + \\phi \\right)\\,.</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>V(t) = L \\frac{dI}{dt} = -\\omega_0 L I_0 \\sin\\left(\\omega_0 t + \\phi \\right) \\,.</math>\n\n=== Initial conditions ===\nThe initial conditions that would satisfy this result are:\n\n:<math>I(0) = I_0 \\cos \\phi \\,. </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>V(0) = L \\frac{dI}{dt}\\Bigg|_{t=0} = -\\omega_0 L I_0 \\sin \\phi \\,.</math>\n\n==Series LC circuit==\n[[File:Series LC Circuit.svg|thumb|right|Series LC circuit]]\n\nIn the series configuration of the LC circuit, the inductor (L) and capacitor (C) are connected in series, as shown here. The total voltage {{mvar|V}} across the open terminals is simply the sum of the voltage across the inductor and the voltage across the capacitor. The current {{mvar|I}} into the positive terminal of the circuit is equal to the current through both the capacitor and the inductor.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} V &= V_L + V_C \\\\ I &= I_L = I_C \\,. \\end{align}</math>\n\n=== Resonance ===\nInductive reactance magnitude {{mvar|X<sub>L</sub>}} increases as frequency increases while [[reactance (electronics)#Capacitive reactance|capacitive reactance]] magnitude {{mvar|X<sub>C</sub>}} decreases with the increase in frequency. At one particular frequency, these two reactances are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign; that frequency is called the resonant frequency {{math|''f''<sub>0</sub>}} for the given circuit.\n\nHence, at resonance:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} X_L &= -X_C \\\\ \\omega L &= \\frac{1}{\\omega C}\\,. \\end{align}</math>\n\nSolving for {{mvar|\u03c9}}, we have\n\n:<math>\\omega = \\omega_0 = \\frac{1}\\sqrt{LC}\\,,</math>\n\nwhich is defined as the resonant angular frequency of the circuit. Converting angular frequency (in radians per second) into frequency (in hertz), one has\n\n:<math>f_0 = \\frac{ \\omega_0 }{ 2 \\pi} = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sqrt{LC}}\\,.</math>\n\nIn a series configuration, {{mvar|X<sub>C</sub>}} and {{mvar|X<sub>L</sub>}} cancel each other out. In real, rather than idealised components, the current is opposed, mostly by the resistance of the coil windings. Thus, the current supplied to a series resonant circuit is a maximum at resonance.\n* In the limit as {{math|''f'' \u2192 ''f''<sub>0</sub>}} current is maximum. Circuit impedance is minimum. In this state, a circuit is called an ''acceptor circuit''.{{Citation needed|reason=Please reference a professional source for the use of acceptor circuit, such as IEEE or similar - not some amateurish web site or publication|date=September 2012}}\n* For {{math|''f'' < ''f''<sub>0</sub>}}, {{math|''X<sub>L</sub>'' \u226a \u2212''X<sub>C</sub>''}}. Hence, the circuit is capacitive.\n* For {{math|''f'' > ''f''<sub>0</sub>}}, {{math|''X<sub>L</sub>'' \u226b \u2212''X<sub>C</sub>''}}. Hence, the circuit is inductive.\n\n===Impedance===\nIn the series configuration, resonance occurs when the complex electrical impedance of the circuit approaches zero.\n\nFirst consider the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the series LC circuit. The total impedance is given by the sum of the inductive and capacitive impedances:\n\n:<math>Z = Z_L + Z_C</math>\n\nWriting the inductive impedance as {{math|''Z<sub>L</sub>'' {{=}} ''j\u03c9L''}} and capacitive impedance as {{math|''Z<sub>C</sub>'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|''j\u03c9C''}}}} and substituting gives\n\n:<math>Z(\\omega) = j \\omega L + \\frac{1}{j\\omega C}\\,.</math>\n\nWriting this expression under a common denominator gives\n\n:<math>Z(\\omega) = j \\left( \\frac{\\omega^2 LC - 1}{\\omega C} \\right)\\,.</math>\n\nFinally, defining the natural angular frequency as\n\n:<math>\\omega_0 = \\frac{1}\\sqrt{LC}\\,,</math>\n\nthe impedance becomes\n\n:<math> Z(\\omega) = jL \\left( \\frac{ \\omega^2 - \\omega_0^2 }{ \\omega } \\right)\\,.</math>\n\nThe numerator implies that in the limit as {{math|''\u03c9'' \u2192 \u00b1''\u03c9''<sub>0</sub>}}, the total impedance {{mvar|Z}} will be zero and otherwise non-zero. Therefore the series LC circuit, when connected in series with a load, will act as a [[band-pass filter]] having zero impedance at the resonant frequency of the LC circuit.\n\n==Parallel LC circuit==\n[[File:Parallel LC Circuit.svg|thumb|Parallel LC Circuit]]\n\nIn the parallel configuration, the inductor L and capacitor C are connected in parallel, as shown here. The voltage {{mvar|V}} across the open terminals is equal to both the voltage across the inductor and the voltage across the capacitor. The total current {{mvar|I}} flowing into the positive terminal of the circuit is equal to the sum of the current flowing through the inductor and the current flowing through the capacitor:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} V &= V_L = V_C \\\\ I &= I_L + I_C \\,. \\end{align}</math>\n\n=== Resonance ===\nWhen {{mvar|X<sub>L</sub>}} equals {{mvar|X<sub>C</sub>}}, the reactive branch currents are equal and opposite. Hence they cancel out each other to give minimum current in the main line. Since total current is minimum, in this state the total impedance is maximum.\n\nThe resonant frequency is given by\n: <math>f_0 = \\frac{ \\omega_0 }{ 2 \\pi } = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sqrt{LC}}\\,. </math>\n\nNote that any reactive branch current is not minimum at resonance, but each is given separately by dividing source voltage ({{mvar|V}}) by reactance ({{mvar|Z}}). Hence {{math|''I'' {{=}} ''{{sfrac|V|Z}}''}}, as per [[Ohm's law]].\n\n* At {{math|''f''<sub>0</sub>}}, the line current is minimum. The total impedance is at the maximum. In this state a circuit is called a ''rejector circuit''.{{Citation needed|reason=Please reference a professional source for the use of rejector circuit, such as IEEE or similar - not some amateurish web site or publication|date=September 2012}}\n* Below {{math|''f''<sub>0</sub>}}, the circuit is inductive.\n* Above {{math|''f''<sub>0</sub>}}, the circuit is capacitive.\n\n=== Impedance ===\n\nThe same analysis may be applied to the parallel LC circuit. The total impedance is then given by:\n\n:<math>Z = \\frac{Z_L Z_C}{Z_L + Z_C}\\,,</math>\n\nand after substitution of {{mvar|Z<sub>L</sub>}} and {{mvar|Z<sub>C</sub>}} and simplification, gives\n\n:<math> Z(\\omega) = -j \\cdot \\frac{ \\omega L}{\\omega^2 LC-1}</math>\n\nwhich further simplifies to\n\n:<math> Z(\\omega) = -j \\left(\\frac{1}{C} \\right) \\left( \\frac{ \\omega }{\\omega^2 - \\omega_0^2 } \\right) \\,,</math>\n\nwhere \n:<math> \\omega_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{LC}} \\,.</math>\n\nNote that\n\n:<math> \\lim_{\\omega \\to \\pm \\omega_0 } Z(\\omega) = \\infty </math>\n\nbut for all other values of {{mvar|\u03c9}} the impedance is finite. The parallel LC circuit connected in series with a load will act as [[band-stop filter]] having infinite impedance at the resonant frequency of the LC circuit. The parallel LC circuit connected in parallel with a load will act as [[band-pass filter]].\n\n==Laplace solution==\nThe LC circuit can be solved by [[Laplace transform]].\n\nLet the general equation be:\n\n:<math> v_C (t)=v(t) </math>\n:<math> i (t)=C\\frac{dv_C}{dt} </math>\n:<math> v_L (t)=L\\frac{di}{dt} </math>\n\n\nLet the differential equation of LC series be: \n\n:<math> v_{in} (t)=v_L (t)+ v_C (t)=L\\frac{di}{dt} + v = LC\\frac{d^2v}{dt^2} + v </math>\n\nWith initial condition:\n:<math> \\begin{cases} v(0) = v_0 \\\\ i(0)=i_0=C*v'(0)=C*v'_0 \\end{cases} </math>\n\nLet define:\n:<math> \\omega_0=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{LC}} </math>\n:<math> f(t)=\\omega_0^2 v_{in} (t) </math>\n\nGives:\n:<math> f(t)=\\frac{d^2v}{dt^2} + \\omega_0^2 v </math>\n\nTransform with Laplace:\n:<math> \\mathcal{L}\\left[f(t)\\right]=\\mathcal{L}\\left[\\frac{d^2v}{dt^2} + \\omega_0^2 v\\right] </math>\n:<math> F(s)=s^2V(s)-sv_0-v'_0 + \\omega_0^2 V(s)</math>\n:<math> V(s)=\\frac{sv_0 + v'_0 + F(s)}{s^2+\\omega_0^2} </math>\n\nThen antitransform:\n:<math> v(t) = v_0\\cos(\\omega_0t)+ \\frac{v'_0}{\\omega_0}\\sin(\\omega_0t) + \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left[\\frac{F(s)}{s^2+\\omega_0^2}\\right] </math>\n\nIn case input voltage is [[Heaviside step function]]:\n:<math> v_{in}(t)=Mu(t)</math>\n:<math> \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left[\\omega_0^2\\frac{V_{in}(s)}{s^2+\\omega_0^2}\\right] = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left[\\omega_0^2M\\frac{1}{s(s^2+\\omega_0^2)}\\right]=M\\omega_0(1-\\cos(\\omega_0 t)) </math>\n:<math> v(t) = v_0\\cos(\\omega_0t)+ \\frac{v'_0}{\\omega_0}\\sin(\\omega_0t) + M\\omega_0(1-\\cos(\\omega_0 t)) </math>\n\nIn case input voltage is sinusoidal function:\n:<math> v_{in}(t)=U\\sin(\\omega_f t) \\Rightarrow V_{in}(s)= \\frac{U\\omega_f}{s^2+\\omega_f^2} </math>\n:<math> \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left[\\omega_0^2\\frac{1}{s^2+\\omega_0^2}\\frac{U\\omega_f}{s^2+\\omega_f^2}\\right] = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left[\\frac{\\omega_0^2 U\\omega_f}{\\omega_f^2-\\omega_0^2}\\left(\\frac{1}{s^2+\\omega_0^2}-\\frac{1}{s^2+\\omega_f^2}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{\\omega_0^2 U\\omega_f}{\\omega_f^2-\\omega_0^2}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\omega_0}\\sin(\\omega_0t)-\\frac{1}{\\omega_f}\\sin(\\omega_ft)\\right)</math>\n:<math> v(t) = v_0\\cos(\\omega_0t)+ \\frac{v'_0}{\\omega_0}\\sin(\\omega_0t) + \\frac{\\omega_0^2 U\\omega_f}{\\omega_f^2-\\omega_0^2}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\omega_0}\\sin(\\omega_0t)-\\frac{1}{\\omega_f}\\sin(\\omega_ft)\\right) </math>\n\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first evidence that a capacitor and inductor could produce electrical oscillations was discovered in 1826 by French scientist [[Felix Savary]].<ref name=\"Blanchard\">{{cite journal\n | last = Blanchard\n | first = Julian\n | authorlink = \n | title = The History of Electrical Resonance\n | journal = Bell System Technical Journal\n | volume = 20\n | issue = 4\n | pages = 415\n | publisher = American Telephone & Telegraph Co.\n | location = U.S.\n | date = October 1941\n | url = https://archive.org/stream/bstj20-4-415#page/n13/mode/2up\n | issn = \n | doi = 10.1002/j.1538-7305.1941.tb03608.x\n | id = \n | accessdate = 2011-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Savary\n | first = Felix\n | authorlink = \n | title = Memoirs sur l'Aimentation\n | journal = Annales de Chimie et de Physique\n | volume = 34\n | issue = \n | pages = 5\u201337\n | publisher = Masson\n | location = Paris\n | year = 1827\n | url = \n | issn = \n | doi = \n | id = \n | accessdate = }}</ref> He found that when a [[Leyden jar]] was discharged through a wire wound around an iron needle, sometimes the needle was left magnetized in one direction and sometimes in the opposite direction.
