For example, \"I am 90% sure he is wrong\". Often false precision is abused to produce an unwarranted confidence in the claim: \"our mouthwash is twice as good as our competitor's\". <ref>*{{cite book|last1=Pirie|first1=Madsen|title=How to Win Every Argument: The Use and Abuse of Logic|date=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|pages=78-80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMPuBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT78#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=22 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn [[science]] and [[engineering]], convention dictates that unless a [[margin of error]] is explicitly stated, the number of [[significant figures]] used in the presentation of data should be limited to what is warranted by the precision of those data. For example, if an instrument can be read to tenths of a unit of measurement, results of calculations using data obtained from that instrument can only be confidently stated to the tenths place, regardless of what the raw calculation returns or whether other data used in the calculation are more accurate. Even outside these disciplines, there is a tendency to assume that all the non-zero digits of a number are meaningful; thus, providing excessive figures may lead the viewer to expect better precision than actually exists.\n\nHowever, in contrast, it is good practice to retain more significant figures than this in the intermediate stages of a calculation, in order to avoid accumulated [[rounding error]]s.\n\nFalse precision commonly arises when high-precision and low-precision data are combined, and in [[conversion of units]].\n\n== Examples ==\nFalse precision is the gist of numerous variations of a joke which can be summarized as follows: A tour guide at a museum says a dinosaur skeleton is 100,000,005 years old, because an expert told him that it was 100 million years old when he started working there 5 years ago.\n\nMeasures that rely on [[statistical sampling]], such as [[IQ tests]], are often reported with false precision.<ref name=lie>{{cite book|last1=Huff|first1=Darrell|title=How to Lie with Statistics|publisher=W.
