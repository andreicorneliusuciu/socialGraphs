The best known mouse species is the common [[house mouse]] (''Mus musculus''). It is also a popular [[pet]]. In some places, certain kinds of [[Apodemus|field mice]] are locally common. They are known to invade homes for food and shelter.\n\n[[Fancy mouse|Domestic mice]] sold as pets often differ substantially in size from the common house mouse. This is attributable both to breeding and to different conditions in the wild. The most well known strain, the white [[Laboratory mouse|lab mouse]], has more uniform traits that are appropriate to its use in research.\n\nThe American [[white-footed mouse]] (''Peromyscus leucopus'') and the ''deer mouse'' (''[[Peromyscus maniculatus]]''), as well as other common species of mouse-like rodents around the world, also sometimes live in houses. These, however, are in other [[genus|genera]].\n\n[[Cat]]s, wild [[dog]]s, [[fox]]es, [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], [[snake]]s and even certain kinds of [[arthropod]]s have been known to prey heavily upon mice. Nevertheless, because of its remarkable adaptability to almost any [[ecological niche|environment]], the mouse is one of the most successful [[mammalian]] genera living on [[Earth]] today.\n\nMice can at times be [[vermin]], damaging and eating [[crops]],<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Meerburg BG, Singleton GR, Leirs H |title=The Year of the Rat ends: time to fight hunger!|journal=Pest Manag Sci |volume=65 |issue=4 |year=2009 |doi=10.1002/ps.1718 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121686000/abstract |pmid=19206089 |pages=351\u20132}}</ref> causing structural damage and spreading [[disease]]s through their [[Parasitism|parasites]] and [[feces]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Meerburg BG, Singleton GR, Kijlstra A |title=Rodent-borne diseases and their risks for public health|journal=Crit Rev Microbiol|volume=35 |issue=3|year=2009|doi=10.1080/10408410902989837|url=http://www.informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10408410902989837 |pmid=19548807 |pages=221\u201370}}</ref> In North America, breathing dust that has come in contact with mouse excrement has been linked to [[hantavirus]], which may lead to [[hantavirus pulmonary syndrome]] (HPS).\n\nPrimarily [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]]<ref name=\"noc1\">{{cite journal|jstor=1374418|title=Nocturnal Explorations of the Forest Deer-Mouse|first=W.

These burrows typically have long entrances and are equipped with escape tunnels or routes. In at least one species, the architectural design of a burrow is a genetic trait.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v493/n7432/full/nature11816.html|title=Discrete genetic modules are responsible for complex burrow evolution in Peromyscus mice|first1=Jesse N.|last1=Weber|first2=Brant K.|last2=Peterson|first3=Hopi E.|last3=Hoekstra|date=17 January 2013|publisher=|journal=Nature|volume=493|issue=7432|pages=402\u2013405|accessdate=15 August 2016|via=www.nature.com|doi=10.1038/nature11816}}</ref>\n\n== Reproduction ==\n[[File:Day-old mice.JPG|right|thumb|one-day-old pups]]\nBreeding onset is at about 50 days of age in both females and males, although females may have their first [[estrus]] at 25\u201340 days. Mice are polyestrous and breed year round; ovulation is spontaneous. The duration of the [[estrous cycle]] is 4\u20135 days and estrus itself lasts about 12 hours, occurring in the evening. Vaginal smears are useful in timed matings to determine the stage of the estrous cycle. Mating is usually nocturnal and may be confirmed by the presence of a [[copulatory plug]] in the vagina up to 24 hours post-copulation. The presence of sperm on a vaginal smear is also a reliable indicator of mating.<ref name=lvma />\n\nFemale mice housed together tend to go into anestrus and do not cycle. If exposed to a male mouse or the pheromones of a male mouse, most of the females will go into estrus in about 72 hours. This synchronization of the estrous cycle is known as the [[Whitten effect]]. The exposure of a recently bred mouse to the pheromones of a strange male mouse may prevent implantation (or [[pseudopregnancy]]), a phenomenon known as the [[Bruce effect]].<ref name=lvma/>\n\nThe average gestation period is 20 days. A fertile [[postpartum estrus]] occurs 14\u201324 hours following [[parturition]], and simultaneous lactation and gestation prolongs gestation 3\u201310 days owing to delayed implantation. The average [[litter (animal)|litter]] size is 10\u201312 during optimum production, but is highly strain-dependent. As a general rule, [[inbred]] mice tend to have longer gestation periods and smaller litters than outbred and hybrid mice. The young are called pups and weigh {{convert|0.5|-|1.5|g|abbr=on}} at birth, are hairless, and have closed eyelids and ears. Cannibalism is uncommon, but females should not be disturbed during parturition and for at least 2 days postpartum. Pups are weaned at 3 weeks of age; weaning weight is {{convert|10|-|12|g|abbr=on}}. If the postpartum estrus is not utilized, the female resumes cycling 2\u20135 days post-weaning.<ref name=lvma/>\n\nNewborn male mice are distinguished from newborn females by noting the greater [[anogenital distance]] and larger [[genital papilla]] in the male. This is best accomplished by lifting the tails of [[littermate]]s and comparing [[perineum]]s.<ref name=lvma/>\n\n== Laboratory mice ==\n{{Main article|Laboratory mouse}}\n[[File:PCWmice1.jpg|thumb|[[Knockout mouse|\nKnockout mice]]]]\n\nMice are common [[experiment]]al animals in laboratory research of [[biology]] and [[psychology]] fields primarily because they are mammals, and also because they share a high degree of [[homology (biology)|homology]] with humans. They are the most commonly used [[mammal]]ian [[model organism]], more common than [[rats]]. The mouse [[genome]] has been sequenced, and virtually all mouse [[gene]]s have human homologs. The mouse has approximately 2.7 billion base pairs and 20 chromosomes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/10002983/2002-release-draft-sequence-of-mouse-genome/|title=2002 Release: Draft Sequence of Mouse Genome|publisher=|accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref>\nThey can also be manipulated in ways that are illegal with humans, although [[animal rights]] activists often object. A '''[[knockout mouse]]''' is a [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] [[mus musculus|mouse]] that has had one or more of its genes made inoperable through a [[gene knockout]].\n\nReasons for common selection of mice are small size, inexpensive, widely varied diet, easily maintained, and can reproduce quickly. Several [[generation]]s of mice can be observed in a relatively short time. Mice are generally very docile if raised from birth and given sufficient human contact. However, certain strains have been known to be quite temperamental. Mice and rats have the same organs in the same places, with the difference of size.\n\n== Subgenera ==\n[[File:Mouse vermin02.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Apodemus|Field mouse]] of the subgenus [[Mus (subgenus)|Mus]].]]\n\nAll members of the ''Mus'' genus are referred to as mice. However, the term ''mouse'' can also be applied to species outside of this genus. ''Mouse'' often refers to any small muroid rodent, while ''[[rat]]'' refers to larger muroid rodents. Therefore, these terms are not [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomically]] specific. For simplicity, only the rodent [[subgenus|subgenera]] belonging to the ''Mus'' genus are listed here.\n\nGenus '''''Mus''''' - Typical mice\n* Subgenus ''[[Coelomys]]'' ([[East Asia]])\n* Subgenus ''[[Mus (subgenus)|Mus]]'' ([[Eurasia]] to [[North Africa]], except for the [[house mouse]] which is worldwide.)\n* Subgenus ''[[Nannomys]]'' ([[Sub-Saharan Africa]])\n* Subgenus ''[[Pyromys]]'' ([[East Asia]])\n* Subgenus and species ''[[Mus lepidoides]]''\n\n== As pets ==\n[[File:Fancy mice.jpg|thumb|250px|Pet mice]]\n{{Main article|Fancy mouse}}\nMany people buy mice as companion pets. They can be playful, loving and can grow used to being handled. Like pet rats, pet mice should not be left unsupervised outside as they have many natural predators, including (but not limited to) birds, snakes, lizards, cats, and dogs. Male mice tend to have a stronger odor than the females.  However, mice are careful groomers and as pets they never need bathing.  Well looked-after mice can make ideal pets. Some common mouse care products are:\n* [[Fancy mouse#Caging|Cage]] \u2013 Usually a [[hamster]] or [[gerbil]] [[Cage (enclosure)|cage]], but a variety of special mouse cages are now available.

Using [[corn husk]] bedding is avoided because it promotes ''[[Aspergillus]]'' [[fungus]], and can grow [[mold]] once it gets wet, which is rough on their feet.\n\n== Diet ==\nIn nature, mice are largely [[herbivore]]s, consuming any kind of fruit or grain from plants.<ref name=ecodome>{{cite web|url=http://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/projects/MarsSim/SimHTML/organisms/mouse.html|title=Mouse Info|publisher=|accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref> However, mice adapt well to urban areas and are known for eating almost all types of food scraps. In captivity, mice are commonly fed commercial pelleted mouse diet. These diets are nutritionally complete, but they still need a large variety of vegetables. Food intake is approximately {{convert|15|g|abbr=on}} per {{convert|100|g|abbr=on}} of body weight per day; water intake is approximately {{convert|15|ml|abbr=on}} per 100 g of body weight per day.<ref name=lvma>{{cite web|url=http://www.lvma.org/mouse.html|title=Louisiana Veterinary Medical Association|publisher=|accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n== As food ==\n[[File:Feeder mice.jpg|250px|thumb|\"Pinkie\" mice for sale as [[reptile]] food]]\nMice are a staple in the diet of many small [[carnivores]].
