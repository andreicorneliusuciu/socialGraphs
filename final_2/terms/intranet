Telleen, http://www.iorg.com/</ref> Generally a wide range of information and services from the organization's internal IT systems are available that would not be available to the public from the [[Internet]]. A company-wide intranet can constitute an important focal point of internal communication and collaboration, and provide a single starting point to access internal and external resources. In its simplest form an intranet is established with the technologies for [[local area network]]s (LANs) and [[wide area network]]s (WANs).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?reload=true&tp=&arnumber=160857|journal=IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing, 1991|title=Fujikama goes Unix|last=Luk|first=A.|volume=2|pages=783\u2013786|publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]|date=9 May 1991|isbn=0879426381|doi=10.1109/PACRIM.1991.160857|accessdate=2013-03-04|quote=The internet and intranet Unix network provide a functioning email facility around the world.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?reload=true&tp=&arnumber=177138|journal=Digital Avionics Systems Conference, 1991.

For example, large numbers of employees discussing key issues in an intranet forum application could lead to new ideas in management, productivity, quality, and other corporate issues.\n\nIn large intranets, website traffic is often similar to public website traffic and can be better understood by using web metrics software to track overall activity. User surveys also improve intranet website effectiveness. Larger businesses allow users within their intranet to access public internet through firewall servers. They have the ability to screen messages coming and going keeping security intact.\n\nWhen part of an intranet is made accessible to customers and others outside the business, that part becomes part of an extranet. Businesses can send private messages through the public network, using special encryption/decryption and other security safeguards to connect one part of their intranet to another.\n\nIntranet user-experience, editorial, and technology teams work together to produce in-house sites. Most commonly, intranets are managed by the communications, [[Human Resource Management|HR]] or [[Chief Information Officer|CIO]] departments of large organizations, or some combination of these.\n\nBecause of the scope and variety of content and the number of system interfaces, intranets of many organizations are much more complex than their respective public websites. Intranets and their use are growing rapidly. According to the [[Intranet design annual]] 2007 from [[Nielsen Norman Group]], the number of pages on participants' intranets averaged 200,000 over the years 2001 to 2003 and has grown to an average of 6 million pages over 2005\u20132007.<ref>Pernice Coyne, Kara; Schwartz, Mathew; Nielsen, Jakob (2007), \"'''Intranet Design Annual 2007'''\", [[Nielsen Norman Group]]</ref>\n\n==Benefits==\n*'''Workforce productivity''': Intranets can help users to locate and view information faster and use applications relevant to their roles and responsibilities. With the help of a [[web browser]] interface, users can access data held in any database the organization wants to make available, anytime and&nbsp;\u2014 subject to security provisions&nbsp;\u2014 from anywhere within the company workstations, increasing the employees ability to perform their jobs faster, more accurately, and with confidence that they have the right information. It also helps to improve the services provided to the users.\n*'''Time''': Intranets allow organizations to distribute information to employees on an ''as-needed'' basis; Employees may link to relevant information at their convenience, rather than being distracted indiscriminately by email.\n*'''Communication''': Intranets can serve as powerful tools for communication within an organization, vertically strategic initiatives that have a global reach throughout the organization. The type of information that can easily be conveyed is the purpose of the initiative and what the initiative is aiming to achieve, who is driving the initiative, results achieved to date, and who to speak to for more information. By providing this information on the intranet, staff have the opportunity to keep up-to-date with the strategic focus of the organization. Some examples of communication would be chat, email, and/or blogs. A great real-world example of where an intranet helped a company communicate is when Nestle had a number of food processing plants in Scandinavia. Their central support system had to deal with a number of queries every day.<ref name=\"McGovern\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gerrymcgovern.com/nt/2002/nt_2002_11_18_intranet_roi.htm|title=Intranet return on investment case studies|last=McGovern|first=Gerry|date=November 18, 2002|accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref>  When Nestle decided to invest in an intranet, they quickly realized the savings.  McGovern says the savings from the reduction in query calls was substantially greater than the investment in the intranet.\n*'''Web publishing''' allows cumbersome corporate knowledge to be maintained and easily accessed throughout the company using [[hypermedia]] and Web technologies.<ref name=\"claromentis\" /> Examples include: employee manuals, benefits documents, company policies, business standards, news feeds, and even training, can be accessed using common Internet standards (Acrobat files, Flash files, CGI applications). Because each business unit can update the online copy of a document, the most recent version is usually available to employees using the intranet.\n*'''Business operations and management''': Intranets are also being used as a platform for developing and deploying applications to support business operations and decisions across the internetworked enterprise.<ref name=\"claromentis\" />\n*'''Cost-effective''': Users can view information and data via web-browser rather than maintaining physical documents such as procedure manuals, internal phone list and requisition forms. This can potentially save the business money on printing, duplicating documents, and the environment as well as document maintenance overhead. For example, the HRM company [[PeopleSoft]] \"derived significant cost savings by shifting HR processes to the intranet\".<ref name=\"McGovern\" /> McGovern goes on to say the manual cost of enrolling in benefits was found to be USD109.48 per enrollment. \"Shifting this process to the intranet reduced the cost per enrollment to $21.79; a saving of 80 percent\". Another company that saved money on expense reports was Cisco. \"In 1996, Cisco processed 54,000 reports and the amount of dollars processed was USD19 million\".<ref name=\"McGovern\" />\n*'''Enhance collaboration''': Information is easily accessible by all authorised users, which enables teamwork.<ref name=\"claromentis\" />\n*'''Cross-platform capability''': Standards-compliant web browsers are available for Windows, Mac, and UNIX.\n*'''Built for one audience''': Many companies dictate computer specifications which, in turn, may allow Intranet developers to write applications that only have to work on one browser (no cross-browser compatibility issues). Being able to specifically address your \"viewer\" is a great advantage. Since Intranets are user-specific (requiring database/network authentication prior to access), you know exactly who you are interfacing with and can personalize your Intranet based on role (job title, department) or individual (\"Congratulations Jane, on your 3rd year with our company!\").\n*'''Promote common corporate culture''': Every user has the ability to view the same information within the Intranet.\n*'''Immediate updates''': When dealing with the public in any capacity, laws, specifications, and parameters can change. Intranets make it possible to provide your audience with \"live\" changes so they are kept up-to-date, which can limit a company's liability.<ref name=\"claromentis\">{{cite web|url=https://www.claromentis.com/blog/top-10-ideas-making-the-most-of-your-corporate-intranet//|title=Making the most of your corporate intranet|last=Christian|first=Michael|date=April 2, 2009|accessdate=2009-04-02}}</ref>\n*'''Supports a distributed computing architecture''': The intranet can also be linked to a company\u2019s management information system, for example a time keeping system.\n\n==Planning and creation==\nMost organizations devote considerable resources into the planning and implementation of their intranet as it is of strategic importance to the organization's success. Some of the planning would include topics such as determining the purpose and goals of the intranet,<ref>{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Andrew|title=8 good business reasons for having an intranet|url=http://www.worldwideintranetchallenge.com/2009/06/7-tips-for-writing-a-business-case-for-an-intranet-update.html|accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Andrew|title=From innovation to operation: the role of the intranet|url=http://www.worldwideintranetchallenge.com/2012/04/innovation-to-operation-the-role-of-the-intranet.html|accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref> identifying persons or departments responsible for implementation and management and devising functional plans, page layouts and designs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intranetblog.com/?p=237|title=Leading an intranet redesign |last=Ward|first=Toby|date=2006-06-11|publisher=[[IntranetBlog]]|accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe appropriate staff would also ensure that implementation schedules and phase-out of existing systems were organized, while defining and implementing security of the intranet and ensuring it lies within legal boundaries and other constraints. In order to produce a high-value end product, systems planners should determine the level of interactivity (e.g. [[wiki]]s, on-line forms) desired.\n\nPlanners may also consider whether the input of new data and updating of existing data is to be centrally controlled or devolve. These decisions sit alongside to the hardware and software considerations (like [[content management systems]]), participation issues (like good taste, harassment, confidentiality), and features to be supported.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libsci.sc.edu/bob/class/clis724/SpecialLibrariesHandbook/Int&SpecLib.html |title=Intranets and Special Libraries: Making the most of inhouse communications|last=LaMee|first=James A.|date=2002-04-30|publisher=University of South Carolina|accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIntranets are often static sites; they are a shared drive, serving up centrally stored documents alongside internal articles or communications (often one-way communication). By leveraging firms which specialise in 'social' intranets, organisations are beginning to think of how their intranets can become a 'communication hub' for their entire team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contentformula.com/articles/2010/bringing-the-internet-indoors-socialising-your-intranet/|title=Bringing the internet indoors - socialising your intranet|last=Scaplehorn|first=geoff|date=2010-03-01|publisher=[[IntranetBlog]]|accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref>\nThe actual implementation would include steps such as securing senior management support and funding.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prescientdigital.com/articles/intranet-articles/intranet-planning-an-intranet-model-for-success|title=Planning: An Intranet Model for success Intranet|last=Ward|first=Toby|accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref> conducting a business requirement analysis and identifying users' information needs.\n\nFrom the technical perspective, there would need to be a co-ordinated installation of the web server and user access network, the required user/client applications and the creation of document framework (or template) for the content to be hosted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/sciences/computerscience/intranet-csci-04.html |title=Intranet: Table of Contents \u2013 Macmillan Computer Sciences: Internet and Beyond|publisher=[[Bookrags.com]]|accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe end-user should be involved in testing and promoting use of the company intranet, possibly through a [[parallel adoption]] methodology or pilot programme. In the long term, the company should carry out ongoing measurement and evaluation, including through benchmarking against other company services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibforum.com/?cmd=CMS_Article_List_View&uuid=Services&article=8f4928b5b6f5584beda884868f3ca458|title=Intranet benchmarking explained|publisher=[[Intranet Benchmarking Forum]]|accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwideintranetchallenge.com/wic/faqs.html|title=Benchmarking intranet end user satisfaction |accessdate=2013-09-03}}</ref>\n\nAnother useful component in an intranet structure might be key personnel committed to maintaining the Intranet and keeping content current. For feedback on the intranet, [[social networking]] can be done through a forum for users to indicate what they want and what they do not like.\n\n==Intranet software==\n[[Microsoft SharePoint]] is the dominant software used for creating intranets. Estimates indicate that around 50% of all intranets are developed using SharePoint;<ref>{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Andrew|title=On what technologies do companies use to develop their intranets|url=http://cibasolutions.typepad.com/wic/2012/07/poll-results-what-technologies-do-companies-use-to-develop-their-intranets.html|accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref> however, there are many alternatives.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Andrew|title=What alternatives are there to SharePoint for an intranet?|url=http://www.worldwideintranetchallenge.com/2011/06/what-alternatives-are-there-to-sharepoint-for-an-intranet.html|accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[eGranary Digital Library]]\n*[[Enterprise portal]]\n*[[Intranet portal]]\n*[[Intranet strategies]]\n*[[Intranet Wiki]]\n*[[Intraweb]]\n*[[Kwangmyong (intranet)]]\n*[[Local area network]]\n*[[Private network]]  IP-addresses to be used inside private networks\n*[[SharePoint]]\n*[[Virtual workplace]]\n*[[Wide area network]]\n*[[Web portal]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Computer networks]]\n[[Category:Internet privacy]]"}]}}}}
