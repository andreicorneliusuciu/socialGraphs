A [[relay]] is a switch that is operated by electricity. Switches are made to handle a wide range of voltages and currents; very large switches may be used to isolate high-voltage circuits in electrical substations.\n\n==Description==\nThe most familiar form of switch is a manually operated [[electromechanical]] device with one or more sets of [[electrical contacts]], which are connected to external circuits.  Each set of contacts can be in one of two states: either \"closed\" meaning the contacts are touching and electricity can flow between them, or \"open\", meaning the contacts are separated and the switch is nonconducting.  The mechanism actuating the transition between these two states (open or closed) can be either a \"''toggle''\" (flip switch for continuous \"on\" or \"off\") or \"''momentary''\" (push-for \"on\" or push-for \"off\") type.\n\nA switch may be directly manipulated by a human as a control signal to a system, such as a computer keyboard button, or to control power flow in a circuit, such as a [[light switch]]. Automatically operated switches can be used to control the motions of machines, for example, to indicate that a garage door has reached its full open position or that a machine tool is in a position to accept another workpiece. Switches may be operated by process variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, current, voltage, and force, acting as [[sensor]]s in a process and used to automatically control a system. For example, a [[thermostat]] is a temperature-operated switch used to control a heating process. A switch that is operated by another electrical circuit is called a [[relay]]. Large switches may be remotely operated by a motor drive mechanism. Some switches are used to isolate electric power from a system, providing a visible point of isolation that can be padlocked if necessary to prevent accidental operation of a machine during maintenance, or to prevent electric shock.\n\nAn ideal switch would have no voltage drop when closed, and would have no limits on voltage or current rating. It would have zero [[rise time]] and [[fall time]] during state changes, and would change state without \"bouncing\" between on and off positions.\n\nPractical switches fall short of this ideal; they have resistance, limits on the current and voltage they can handle, finite switching time, etc. The ideal switch is often used in circuit analysis as it greatly simplifies the system of equations to be solved, but this can lead to a less accurate solution. Theoretical treatment of the effects of non-ideal properties is required in the design of large networks of switches, as for example used in telephone exchanges.\n\n==Contacts==\n[[File:On-Off Switch.jpg|100px|thumb|A toggle switch in the \"on\" position.]]\nIn the simplest case, a switch has two conductive pieces, often [[metal]], called ''contacts'', connected to an external [[Electric circuit|circuit]], that touch to complete (make) the circuit, and separate to open (break) the circuit. The contact material is chosen for its resistance to [[corrosion]], because most metals form [[Electrical insulation|insulating]] [[oxide]]s that would prevent the switch from working. Contact materials are also chosen on the basis of [[electrical conductivity]], [[Hardness (materials science)|hardness]] (resistance to [[Wear#Abrasive wear|abrasive wear]]), [[Strength of materials|mechanical strength]], low cost and low [[toxicity]].\n\nSometimes the contacts are [[Electroplating|plated]] with [[noble metals]]. They may be [[design]]ed to wipe against each other to clean off any contamination. Nonmetallic [[electrical conductor|conductors]], such as conductive [[plastic]], are sometimes used. To prevent the formation of insulating oxides, a minimum [[wetting current]] may be specified for a given switch design.\n\n{{anchor|Two-way switch|Three-way switch|Four-way switch|Contact arrangements|Contact terminology}}\n{{anchor|contact_terminology}}\n===Contact terminology===\n[[File:Tpst.jpg|300px|thumb|Triple-pole single-throw (TPST or 3PST) [[knife switch]] used to short the windings of a 3\u2011phase wind turbine for [[Dynamic braking|braking]] purposes. Here the switch is shown in the open position.]]\n\nIn electronics, switches are classified according to the arrangement of their contacts. A pair of contacts is said to be \"''closed''\" when current can flow from one to the other. When the contacts are separated by an [[insulator (electric)|insulating air gap]], they are said to be \"''open''\", and no current can flow between them at normal voltages.  The terms \"''make''\" for closure of contacts and \"''break''\" for opening of contacts are also widely used.\n\nThe terms '''pole''' and '''throw''' are also used to describe switch contact variations. The number of \"''poles''\" is the number of electrically separate switches which are controlled by a single physical actuator. For example, a \"''2-pole''\" switch has two separate, parallel sets of contacts that open and close in unison via the same mechanism. The number of \"''throws''\" is the number of separate wiring path choices other than \"open\" that the switch can adopt for each pole. A single-throw switch has one pair of contacts that can either be closed or open. A double-throw switch has a contact that can be connected to either of two other contacts, a triple-throw has a contact which can be connected to one of three other contacts, etc.<ref>[http://www.herley.com/index.cfm?act=app_notes&notes=switches RF Switch] Explanation by [[Herley Industries|Herley&nbsp;\u2013 General Microwave]]</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Break-before-make|Make-before-break}}\nIn a switch where the contacts remain in one state unless actuated, such as a [[push-button]] switch, the contacts can either be '''normally open''' (abbreviated \"'''n.o.'''\" or \"'''no'''\") until closed by operation of the switch, or '''normally closed''' (\"'''n.c.'''\" or \"'''nc'''\") and opened by the switch action. A switch with both types of contact is called a ''changeover switch''. These may be \"'''make-before-break'''\" (\"'''MBB'''\" or shorting) which momentarily connects both circuits, or may be \"'''break-before-make'''\" (\"'''BBM'''\" or non-shorting) which interrupts one circuit before closing the other.\n\nThese terms have given rise to abbreviations for the types of switch which are used in the [[electronics]] industry such as \"''single-pole, single-throw''\" (SPST) (the simplest type, \"on or off\") or \"''single-pole, double-throw''\" (SPDT), connecting either of two terminals to the common terminal. In [[Mains electricity|electrical power]] wiring (i.e.,&nbsp;house and building wiring by [[electrician]]s), names generally involve the suffix ''\"-way\"''; however, these terms differ between [[British English]] and [[American English]] (i.e., the terms ''two&nbsp;way'' and ''three&nbsp; way'' are used with different meanings).\n\n{{Anchor|Table of switch comparisons|Table of switch types}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The switch bounces between on and off several times before settling.]]\nContact bounce (also called ''chatter'') is a common problem with mechanical switches and [[relay]]s. Switch and relay contacts are usually made of springy metals. When the contacts strike together, their momentum and elasticity act together to cause them to bounce apart one or more times before making steady contact. The result is a rapidly pulsed electric current instead of a clean transition from zero to full current. The effect is usually unimportant in power circuits, but causes problems in some [[analogue electronics|analogue]] and [[logic circuit]]s that respond fast enough to misinterpret the on\u2011off pulses as a data stream.<ref name=\"Walker1998\">Walker, PMB, ''[[Chambers Science and Technology Dictionary]]'', Edinburgh, 1988, ISBN 1-85296-150-3</ref>\n\nThe effects of contact bounce can be eliminated by use of [[mercury-wetted relay|mercury-wetted contacts]], but these are now infrequently used because of the hazard of mercury release.   Alternatively, contact circuit voltages can be [[low-pass filter]]ed to reduce or eliminate multiple pulses from appearing. In digital systems, multiple samples of the contact state can be taken at a low rate and examined for a steady sequence, so that contacts can settle before the contact level is considered reliable and acted upon. Bounce in SPDT switch contacts signals can be filtered out using a [[Multivibrator#Bistable|SR flip-flop]] (latch)  or [[Schmitt trigger]]. All of these methods are referred to as 'debouncing'.\n\nBy analogy, the term \"debounce\" has arisen in the software development industry to describe rate-limiting or throttling the frequency of a method's execution.<ref>[http://unscriptable.com/2009/03/20/debouncing-javascript-methods/ \"Debouncing Javascript Methods\"]</ref>\n\n===Arcs and quenching===\nWhen the power being switched is sufficiently large, the electron flow across opening switch contacts is sufficient to [[ionize]] the air molecules across the tiny gap between the contacts as the switch is opened, forming a [[gas plasma]], also known as an [[electric arc]]. The plasma is of low resistance and is able to sustain power flow, even with the separation distance between the switch contacts steadily increasing. The plasma is also very hot and is capable of eroding the metal surfaces of the switch contacts. Electric current arcing causes significant [[Contact protection#Contact wear|degradation of the contacts]] and also significant [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI), requiring the use of [[arc suppression]] methods.<ref>{{cite web | title = Lab Note #105 ''Contact Life&nbsp;\u2013 Unsuppressed vs. Suppressed Arcing'' | author=  | publisher = Arc Suppression Technologies | date = April 2011 | url = http://www.arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/arc-suppression-facts/lab-app-notes/ | accessdate = February 5, 2012| format=[[pdf]]}} (3.6 Mb)</ref>\n\nWhere the voltage is sufficiently high, an arc can also form as the switch is closed and the contacts approach. If the voltage potential is sufficient to exceed the [[breakdown voltage]] of the air separating the contacts, an arc forms which is sustained until the switch closes completely and the switch surfaces make contact.\n\nIn either case, the standard method for minimizing arc formation and preventing contact damage is to use a fast-moving switch mechanism, typically using a spring-operated [[Tipping point (physics)|tipping-point mechanism]] to assure quick motion of switch contacts, regardless of the speed at which the switch control is operated by the user. Movement of the switch control lever applies tension to a spring until a tipping point is reached, and the contacts suddenly snap open or closed as the spring tension is released.\n\nAs the power being switched increases, other methods are used to minimize or prevent arc formation. A plasma is hot and will rise due to [[convection]] air currents. The arc can be quenched with a series of non-conductive blades spanning the distance between switch contacts, and as the arc rises, its length increases as it forms ridges rising into the spaces between the blades, until the arc is too long to stay sustained and is extinguished. A ''puffer'' may be used to blow a sudden high velocity burst of gas across the switch contacts, which rapidly extends the length of the arc to extinguish it quickly.\n\nExtremely large switches in excess of 100,000\u2011watt capacity often have switch contacts surrounded by something other than air to more rapidly extinguish the arc. For example, the switch contacts may operate in a vacuum, immersed in [[mineral oil]], or in [[Sulfur hexafluoride#Dielectric medium|sulfur hexafluoride]].\n\nIn AC power service, the current periodically passes through zero; this effect makes it harder to sustain an arc on opening. Manufacturers may rate switches with lower voltage or current rating when used in DC&nbsp;circuits.\n\n===Power switching===\nWhen a switch is designed to switch significant power, the transitional state of the switch as well as the ability to withstand continuous operating currents must be considered. When a switch is in the on state, its resistance is near zero and very little power is dropped in the contacts; when a switch is in the off state, its resistance is extremely high and even less power is dropped in the contacts. However, when the switch is flicked, the resistance must pass through a state where a quarter of the load's rated power{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} (or worse if the load is not purely resistive) is briefly dropped in the switch.\n\nFor this reason, power switches intended to interrupt a load current have spring mechanisms to make sure the transition between on and off is as short as possible regardless of the speed at which the user moves the rocker.\n\nPower switches usually come in two types. A momentary on\u2011off switch (such as on a [[laser pointer]]) usually takes the form of a button and only closes the circuit when the button is depressed. A regular on\u2011off switch (such as on a [[flashlight]]) has a constant on-off feature. Dual-action switches incorporate both of these features.\n\n===Inductive loads===\nWhen a strongly [[inductance|inductive]] load such as an [[electric motor]] is switched off, the current cannot drop instantaneously to zero; a [[Electric arc|spark]] will jump across the opening contacts. Switches for [[inductance|inductive]] loads must be rated to handle these cases. The spark will cause [[electromagnetic interference]] if not suppressed; a [[snubber]] network of a [[resistor]] and [[capacitor]] in series will quell the spark.\n\n===Incandescent loads===\n[[File:General-Electric-silent-T-rated-light-switch.jpg|65px|thumb|right|A \"T-rated\" wall switch (the T is for ''Tungsten'' filament)<ref name=\"Electrical_Power_Systems_Technology_pg337\">{{cite book |title=Electrical Power Systems Technology |last1=Fardo |first1=Stephen |last2=Patrick |first2=Dale |date=2009-01-01 |publisher=The Fairmont Press, Inc. |page=337 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bohwbWi3bUMC&lpg=PA337&dq=switch%20T-rated&pg=PA337#v=onepage&q=switch%20T-rated&f=false |accessdate=2015-01-26}}</ref> that is suited for incandescent loads.]]When turned on, an [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent lamp]] draws a large [[inrush current]]  of about ten times the steady-state current; as the filament heats up, its resistance rises and the current decreases to a steady-state value. A switch designed for an incandescent lamp load can withstand this inrush current.<ref name=\"Electrical_Power_Systems_Technology_pg337\"/>\n\n===Wetting current===\n''[[Wetting current]]'' is the minimum current needing to flow through a mechanical switch while it is operated to break through any film of [[oxidation]] that may have been deposited on the switch contacts.<ref>Gregory K. McMillan (ed) ''Process/Industrial Instruments and Controls Handbook (5th Edition)'' (McGraw Hill, 1999) ISBN 0-07-012582-1 page 7.26</ref> The film of oxidation occurs often in areas with high [[humidity]]. Providing a sufficient amount of wetting current is a crucial step in designing [[Control engineering|systems]] that use delicate switches with small [[contact pressure]] as sensor inputs. Failing to do this might result in switches remaining electrically \"open\" due to contact oxidation.\n\n==Actuator==\nThe moving part that applies the operating force to the contacts is called the ''[[actuator]]'', and may be a '''toggle''' or ''dolly'', a '''rocker''', a '''push-button''' or any type of mechanical linkage ''(see photo).''\n\n===Biased switches===\nA switch normally maintains its set position once position once operated. A biased switch contains a mechanism that springs it into another position when released by an operator. The momentary [[push-button]] switch is a type of biased switch. The most common type is a \"push-to-make\" (or normally-open or NO) switch, which makes contact when the button is pressed and breaks when the button is released. Each key of a computer keyboard, for example, is a normally-open \"push-to-make\" switch. A \"push-to-break\" (or normally-closed or NC) switch, on the other hand, breaks contact when the button is pressed and makes contact when it is released. An example of a push-to-break switch is a button used to release a door held closed by an [[electromagnet]]. The interior lamp of a household [[refrigerator]] is controlled by a switch that is held open when the door is closed.\n\n===Rotary switch===\n{{main|Rotary switch}}\n[[File:Rotaryswitch.gif|thumb|A three-deck stacked rotary switch. Any number of switching elements may be stacked in this manner, by using a longer shaft and additional spacing standoffs between each switching element.]]\n\nA rotary switch operates with a twisting motion of the operating handle with at least two positions. One or more positions of the switch may be momentary (biased with a spring), requiring the operator to hold the switch in the position. Other positions may have a detent to hold the position when released. A rotary switch may have multiple levels or \"decks\" in order to allow it to control multiple circuits.\n\nOne form of  rotary switch consists of a spindle or \"rotor\" that has a contact arm or \"spoke\" which projects from its surface like a cam. It has an array of terminals, arranged in a circle around the rotor, each of which serves as a contact for the \"spoke\" through which any one of a number of different electrical circuits can be connected to the rotor. The switch is layered to allow the use of multiple poles, each layer is equivalent to one pole. Usually such a switch has a detent mechanism so it \"clicks\" from one active position to another rather than stalls in an intermediate position. Thus a rotary switch provides greater pole and throw capabilities than simpler switches do.\n\nOther types use a cam mechanism to operate multiple independent sets of contacts.\n\nRotary switches were used as channel selectors on television receivers until the early 1970s, as range selectors on electrical metering equipment, as band selectors on multi-band radios and other similar purposes. In industry, rotary switches are used for control of measuring instruments, [[switchgear]], or in control circuits.  For example, a [[radio control]]led overhead crane may have a large multi-circuit rotary switch to transfer hard-wired control signals from the local manual controls in the cab to the outputs of the remote control receiver.\n\n===Toggle switch===\n[[File:togglesw2.jpg|thumb|Large toggle switch, depicted in circuit \"open\" position, electrical contacts to left; background is 1/4\" square graph paper]]\n[[File:Nova1200.agr.jpg|thumb|Bank of toggle switches on a [[Data General Nova]] [[minicomputer]] front panel.]]\n[[File:Toggle switch logic.jpg|thumb|Toggle switches with the shared cover preventing certain forbidden combinations]]\n\nA toggle switch is a class of electrical switches that are manually actuated by a mechanical [[lever]], handle, or rocking mechanism.\n\nToggle switches are available in many different styles and sizes, and are used in numerous applications. Many are designed to provide the simultaneous actuation of multiple sets of [[electrical contact]]s, or the control of large amounts of [[electric current]] or [[Mains electricity|mains]] voltages.\n\nThe word \"toggle\" is a reference to a kind of mechanism or joint consisting of two arms, which are almost in line with each other, connected with an elbow-like pivot. However, the phrase \"toggle switch\" is applied to a switch with a short handle and a positive snap-action, whether it actually contains a toggle mechanism or not. Similarly, a switch where a definitive click is heard, is called a \"positive on-off switch\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Gladstone|first=Bernard|title=The New York times complete manual of home repair|year=1978|publisher=Times Books|pages=399|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9VGAAAAYAAJ&q=heard#search_anchor}}</ref> A very common use of this type of switch is to switch lights or other electrical equipment on or off. Multiple toggle switches may be mechanically interlocked to prevent forbidden combinations.\n\nIn some contexts, particularly [[computing]], a toggle switch, or the action of toggling, is understood in the different sense of a mechanical or software switch that alternates between two states each time it is activated, regardless of mechanical construction. For example, the [[caps lock]] key on a computer causes all letters to be generated in capitals after it is pressed once; pressing it again reverts to lower-case letters.\n\n==Special types==\n[[File:Float switch on.jpg|thumb|Opened [[float switch]] of a dirty water pump]]\nSwitches can be designed to respond to any type of mechanical stimulus: for example, vibration (the trembler switch), tilt, air pressure, fluid level (a [[float switch]]), the turning of a key ([[key switch]]), linear or rotary movement (a [[limit switch]] or [[microswitch]]), or presence of a magnetic field (the [[reed switch]]). Many switches are operated automatically by changes in some environmental condition or by motion of machinery. A [[limit switch]] is used, for example, in machine tools to interlock operation with the proper position of tools. In heating or cooling systems a [[sail switch]] ensures that air flow is adequate in a duct. [[Pressure switch]]es respond to fluid pressure.\n\n===Mercury tilt switch===\n{{main|Mercury switch}}\nThe mercury switch consists of a drop of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] inside a [[glass]] bulb with two or more contacts. The two contacts pass through the glass, and are connected by the mercury when the bulb is tilted to make the mercury roll on to them.\n\nThis type of switch performs much better than the ball tilt switch, as the [[liquid metal]] connection is unaffected by dirt, debris and oxidation, it wets the contacts ensuring a very low resistance bounce-free connection, and movement and vibration do not produce a poor contact. These types can be used for precision works.\n\nIt can also be used where arcing is dangerous (such as in the presence of explosive vapour) as the entire unit is sealed.\n\n===Knife switch===\n{{main|Knife switch}}\n[[File:Sectionneur.JPG|thumb|right|upright|A high-voltage disconnect switch used in an electrical substation. Such switches are used mostly to isolate circuits, and usually cannot break load current. High-voltage switches are available for the highest transmission voltages, up to 1&nbsp;million volts. This switch is gang-operated so that all three phases are interrupted at the same time.]]\n\nKnife switches consist of a flat metal blade, hinged at one end, with an insulating handle for operation, and a fixed contact. When the switch is closed, current flows through the hinged pivot and blade and through the fixed contact. Such switches are usually not enclosed. The knife and contacts are typically formed of [[copper]], [[steel]], or [[brass]], depending on the application. Fixed contacts may be backed up with a spring. Several parallel blades can be operated at the same time by one handle. The parts may be mounted on an insulating base with terminals for wiring, or may be directly bolted to an insulated switch board in a large assembly. Since the electrical contacts are exposed, the switch is used only where people cannot accidentally come in contact with the switch or where the voltage is so low as to not present a hazard.\n\nKnife switches are made in many sizes from miniature switches to large devices used to carry thousands of amperes. In electrical transmission and distribution, gang-operated switches are used in circuits up to the highest voltages.\n\nThe disadvantages of the knife switch are the slow opening speed and the proximity of the operator to exposed live parts. Metal-enclosed safety [[disconnect switch]]es are used for isolation of circuits in industrial power distribution. Sometimes spring-loaded auxiliary blades are fitted which momentarily carry the full current during opening, then quickly part to rapidly extinguish the arc.\n\n===Footswitch===\nA footswitch is a rugged switch which is operated by foot pressure. An example of use is in the control of a machine tool, allowing the operator to have both hands free to manipulate the workpiece. The foot control of an [[electric guitar]] is also a footswitch.\n\n===Reversing switch===\nA DPDT switch has six connections, but since polarity reversal is a very common usage of DPDT switches, some variations of the DPDT switch are internally wired specifically for polarity reversal. These crossover switches only have four terminals rather than six. Two of the terminals are inputs and two are outputs. When connected to a battery or other DC source, the 4-way switch selects from either normal or reversed polarity. Such switches can also be used as intermediate switches in a [[multiway switching]] system for control of lamps by more than two switches.\n\n==Light switches==\n{{main|Light switch}}\nIn building wiring, light switches are installed at convenient locations to control lighting and occasionally other circuits. By use of multiple-pole switches, [[multiway switching]] control of a lamp can be obtained from two or more places, such as the ends of a corridor or stairwell. A [[wireless light switch]] allows remote control of lamps for convenience; some lamps include a [[touch switch]] which electronically controls the lamp if touched anywhere. In public buildings  several types of [[vandal resistant switch]]es are used to prevent unauthorized use.\n\n==Electronic switches==\n[[File:Tactile switches.jpg|thumb|right|Three push button switches (Tactile Switches). Major scale is inches.]]\n{{see also|Electronic switch}}\nA [[relay]] is an electrically operated switch. Many relays use an electromagnet to operate a switching mechanism mechanically, but other operating principles are also used. [[Solid-state relays]] control power circuits with no moving parts, instead using a semiconductor device to perform switching\u2014often a [[silicon-controlled rectifier]] or [[TRIAC|triac]].\n\nThe [[analogue switch]] uses two [[MOSFET]] transistors in a [[transmission gate]] arrangement as a switch that works much like a relay, with some advantages and several limitations compared to an electromechanical relay.\n\nThe power transistor(s) in a [[switching voltage regulator]], such as a [[power supply unit (computer)|power supply unit]], are used like a switch to alternately let power flow and block power from flowing.\n\nMany people use [[metonymy]] to call a variety of devices \"switches\" that conceptually connect or disconnect signals and communication paths between electrical devices, analogous to the way mechanical switches connect and disconnect paths for electrons to flow between two conductors. Early telephone systems used an automatically operated [[Strowger switch]] to connect telephone callers; telephone exchanges contain one or more [[crossbar switch]]es today.\n\nSince the advent of [[digital logic]] in the 1950s, the term ''switch'' has spread to a variety of digital [[active device]]s such as [[transistor]]s and [[logic gate]]s whose function is to change their output state between two [[logic level]]s or connect different [[Digital signal (electronics)|signal]] lines, and even computers, [[network switch]]es, whose function is to provide connections between different [[computer port (hardware)|ports]] in a [[computer network]]. The term 'switched' is also applied to [[telecommunications network]]s, and signifies a network that is [[circuit switched]], providing dedicated circuits for communication between end nodes, such as the [[public switched telephone network]]. The common feature of all these usages is they refer to devices that control a [[binary numeral system|binary]] [[State (computing)|state]]: they are either ''on'' or ''off'', ''closed'' or ''open'', ''connected'' or ''not connected''.\n\n==Other switches==\n{{div col||20em}}\n* [[Centrifugal switch]]\n* [[Company switch]]\n* [[Dead man's switch]]\n* [[Fireman's switch]]\n* [[Hall-effect switch]]\n* [[Inertial switch]]\n* [[Isolator switch]]\n* [[Kill switch]]\n* [[Light switch]]\n* [[Latching switch]]\n* [[Load control switch]]\n* [[Membrane switch]]\n* [[Piezo switch]]\n* [[Pull switch]]\n* [[Push switch]]\n* [[RF Switch Matrix]]\n* [[Sense switch]]\n* [[Slotted optical switch]]\n* [[Stepping switch]]\n* [[Switch access]]\n* [[Electric switchboard]]\n* [[Switchgear]]\n* [[Thermal switch]]\n* [[Time switch]]\n* [[Touch switch]]\n* [[Transfer switch]]\n* [[Zero speed switch]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Commutator (electric)]]\n* [[Cutout (electric power distribution)|Cutout]]\n* [[DIN rail]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{Commons category|Electric switches}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Electrical components]]\n[[Category:Human\u2013machine interaction]]\n[[Category:Switches| ]]"}]}}}}
