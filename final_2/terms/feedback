According to [[William Ross Ashby|Ashby]] (1956), mathematicians and theorists interested in the ''principles'' of feedback mechanisms prefer the definition of ''circularity of action'', which keeps the theory simple and consistent. For those with more ''practical'' aims, feedback should be a deliberate effect via some more tangible connection.\n::\"[Practical experimenters] object to the mathematician's definition, pointing out that this would force them to say that feedback was present in the ordinary pendulum ... between its position and its momentum\u2014a 'feedback' that, from the practical point of view, is somewhat mystical.

The controlled system is the car; its input includes the combined torque from the engine and from the changing slope of the road (the disturbance). The car's speed (status) is measured by a [[speedometer]].  The error signal is the departure of the speed as measured by the speedometer from the target speed (set point). This measured error is interpreted by the controller to adjust the accelerator, commanding the fuel flow to the engine (the effector). The resulting change in engine torque, the feedback, combines with the torque exerted by the changing road grade to reduce the error in speed, minimizing the road disturbance.\n\nThe terms \"positive\" and \"negative\" were first applied to feedback prior to WWII. The idea of positive feedback was already current in the 1920s with the introduction of the [[regenerative circuit]].<ref name=mindell>\n{{Cite book\n|author=David A.

In contrast, Nyquist and Bode, when they built on Black\u2019s work, referred to negative feedback as that with the sign reversed.

Levine, Hiram E. Fitzgerald.

As Connellan and Zemke (1993) put it:\n::\"''Quantitative'' feedback tells us how much and how many. ''Qualitative'' feedback tells us how good, bad or indifferent.\"<ref name=Connellan>Thomas K. Connellan and Ron Zemke, \"Sustaining Knock Your Socks Off Service\" AMACOM, 1 July 1993.

But when the parts rise to even as few as four, if every one affects the other three, then twenty circuits can be traced through them; and knowing the properties of all the twenty circuits does not give complete information about the system.\"<ref name=Ashby/>{{rp|page=54}}\n\n===Other types of feedback===\nIn general, feedback systems can have many signals fed back and the feedback loop frequently contain mixtures of positive and negative feedback where positive and negative feedback can dominate at different frequencies or different points in the state space of a system.\n\nThe term bipolar feedback has been coined to refer to biological systems where positive and negative feedback systems can interact, the output of one affecting the input of another, and vice versa.<ref name=Smit>\n{{cite book |title=Introduction to Bioregulatory Medicine |author1=Alta Smit |author2=Arturo O'Byrne |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzXAOUnCM3oC&pg=PA6 |page=6 |chapter=Bipolar feedback |isbn=9783131469717 |year=2011 |publisher=Thieme}}\n</ref>\n\nSome systems with feedback can have very complex behaviors such as [[Chaos theory|chaotic behaviors]] in non-linear systems, while others have much more predictable behaviors, such as those that are used to make and design digital systems.\n\nFeedback is used extensively in digital systems. For example, binary counters and similar devices employ feedback where the current state and inputs are used to calculate a new state which is then fed back and clocked back into the device to update it.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Biology===\n{{See also|Homeostasis|Allostasis}}\nIn [[biological]] systems such as [[organism]]s, [[ecosystem]]s, or the [[biosphere]], most parameters must stay under control within a narrow range around a certain optimal level under certain environmental conditions. The deviation of the optimal value of the controlled parameter can result from the changes in internal and external environments. A change of some of the environmental conditions may also require change of that range to change for the system to function. The value of the parameter to maintain is recorded by a reception system and conveyed to a regulation module via an information channel. An example of this is [[Insulin oscillations]].\n\nBiological systems contain many types of regulatory circuits, both positive and negative. As in other contexts, ''positive'' and ''negative'' do not imply that the feedback causes ''good'' or ''bad'' effects. A negative feedback loop is one that tends to slow down a process, whereas the positive feedback loop tends to accelerate it. The [[mirror neuron]]s are part of a social feedback system, when an observed action is \"mirrored\" by the brain\u2014like a self-performed action.\n\nFeedback is also central to the operations of [[gene]]s and [[gene regulatory network]]s. [[Repressor protein|Repressor]] (see [[Lac repressor]]) and [[activator protein|activator]] [[protein]]s are used to create genetic [[operon]]s, which were identified by [[Francois Jacob]] and [[Jacques Monod]] in 1961 as ''feedback loops''. These feedback loops may be positive (as in the case of the coupling between a sugar molecule and the proteins that import sugar into a bacterial cell), or negative (as is often the case in [[metabolic]] consumption).\n\nOn a larger scale, feedback can have a stabilizing effect on animal populations even when profoundly affected by external changes, although time lags in feedback response can give rise to [[Lotka\u2013Volterra equation|predator-prey cycles]].<ref>\nCS Holling. \"Resilience and stability of ecological systems\". Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics 4:1-23. 1973</ref>\n\nIn [[fermentation (biochemistry)|zymology]], feedback serves as regulation of activity of an enzyme by its direct product(s) or downstream metabolite(s) in the metabolic pathway (see [[Allosteric regulation]]).\n\nThe [[hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis]] is largely controlled by positive and negative feedback, much of which is still unknown.\n\nIn [[psychology]], the body receives a stimulus from the environment or internally that causes the release of [[hormones]]. Release of hormones then may cause more of those hormones to be released, causing a positive feedback loop. This cycle is also found in certain behaviour. For example, \"shame loops\" occur in people who blush easily. When they realize that they are blushing, they become even more embarrassed, which leads to further blushing, and so on.<ref>{{cite web|last=Scheff |first=Thomas |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/lets-connect/200909/the-emotionalrelational-world |title=The Emotional/Relational World |publisher=Psychology Today |date=2009-09-02 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref>\n\n===Climate science===\n{{Main article|Climate change feedback}}\n\nThe climate system is characterized by strong positive and negative feedback loops between processes that affect the state of the atmosphere, ocean, and land. A simple example is the [[Ice-albedo feedback|ice-albedo positive feedback]] loop whereby melting snow exposes more dark ground (of lower [[albedo]]), which in turn absorbs heat and causes more snow to melt.\n\n===Control theory===\n{{Main article|Control theory}}\nFeedback is extensively used in control theory, using a variety of methods including [[state space (controls)]], [[full state feedback]] (also known as pole placement), and so forth. Note that in the context of control theory, \"feedback\" is traditionally assumed to specify \"negative feedback\".<ref name=mees>\n''\"There is a tradition in control theory that one deals with a ''negative feedback loop'' in which a negative sign is included in the feedback loop...\"'' \nA.I.Mees, \"Dynamics of Feedback Systems\", New York: J.

In 1745, the windmill was improved by blacksmith Edmund Lee, who added a [[windmill fantail|fantail]] to keep the face of the windmill pointing into the wind. In 1787, [[Thomas Mead]] regulated the rotation speed of a windmill by using a centrifugal pendulum to adjust the distance between the bedstone and the runner stone (i.e., to adjust the load).\n\nThe use of the [[centrifugal governor]] by [[James Watt]] in 1788 to regulate the speed of his [[steam engine]] was one factor leading to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Steam engines also use float valves and pressure release valves as mechanical regulation devices. A [[mathematical analysis]] of Watt's governor was done by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1868.<ref name=maxwell/>\n\nThe ''[[SS Great Eastern|Great Eastern]]'' was one of the largest steamships of its time and employed a steam powered rudder with feedback mechanism designed in 1866 by [[John McFarlane Gray]]. [[Joseph Farcot]] coined the word ''[[Servomechanism|servo]]'' in 1873 to describe steam-powered steering systems. Hydraulic servos were later used to position guns.

Negative feedback is often deliberately introduced to increase the [[BIBO stability|stability]] and accuracy of a system by correcting or reducing the influence of unwanted changes.  This scheme can fail if the input changes faster than the system can respond to it.  When this happens, the lag in arrival of the correcting signal can result in overcorrection, causing the output to [[oscillation|oscillate]] or \"hunt\".<ref>With mechanical devices, hunting can be severe enough to destroy the device.</ref> While often an unwanted consequence of system behaviour, this effect is used deliberately in electronic oscillators.\n\n[[Harry Nyquist]] contributed the [[Nyquist plot]] for assessing the stability of feedback systems. An easier assessment, but less general, is based upon [[Gain margin|gain margin and phase margin]] using [[Gain margin|Bode plot]]s (contributed by [[Hendrik Wade Bode|Hendrik Bode]]). Design to ensure stability often involves [[frequency compensation]], one method of compensation being [[pole splitting]].\n\nElectronic feedback loops are used to control the output of [[electronics|electronic]] devices, such as [[amplifiers]]. A feedback loop is created when all or some portion of the output is fed back to the input. A device is said to be operating ''open loop'' if no output feedback is being employed and ''closed loop'' if feedback is being used.<ref>P. Horowitz & W. Hill, ''The Art of Electronics'', Cambridge University Press (1980), Chapter 3, relating to operational amplifiers.</ref>\n\nWhen two or more amplifiers are cross-coupled using positive feedback, complex behaviors can be created. These ''[[multivibrator]]s'' are widely used and include:\n\n:*astable circuits, which act as oscillators\n:*monostable circuits, which can be pushed into a state, and will return to the stable state after some time\n:*bistable circuits, which have two stable states that the circuit can be switched between\n\n====Negative feedback====\nA Negative feedback occurs when the fed-back output signal has a relative phase of 180\u00b0 with respect to the input signal (upside down). This situation is sometimes referred to as being ''out of phase'', but that term also is used to indicate other phase separations, as in \"90\u00b0 out of phase\". Negative feedback can be used to correct output errors or to desensitize a system to unwanted fluctuations.<ref name=Bhattacharya>\nFor an analysis of desensitization in the system pictured, see {{cite book |author=S.K Bhattacharya |title=Linear Control Systems |pages=134\u2013135 |quote=The parameters of a system ... may vary...

A general expression for the gain of a negative feedback amplifier is the [[asymptotic gain model]].\n\n====Positive feedback====\nPositive feedback occurs when the fed-back signal is in phase with the input signal. Under certain gain conditions, positive feedback reinforces the input signal to the point where the output of the device [[oscillates]] between its maximum and minimum possible states. Positive feedback may also introduce [[hysteresis]] into a circuit. This can cause the circuit to ignore small signals and respond only to large ones. It is sometimes used to eliminate noise from a digital signal. Under some circumstances, positive feedback may cause a device to latch, i.e., to reach a condition in which the output is locked to its maximum or minimum state. This fact is very widely used in digital electronics to make [[Flip-flop (electronics)|bistable]] circuits for volatile storage of information.\n\nThe loud squeals that sometimes occurs in [[audio system]]s, [[public address system|PA systems]], and [[rock music]] are known as [[audio feedback]]. If a microphone is in front of a loudspeaker that it is connected to, sound that the microphone picks up comes out of the speaker, and is picked up by the microphone and re-amplified.

They are widely used in many electronic devices.  Common examples of signals generated by oscillators include signals broadcast by [[Radio transmitter|radio]] and [[television transmitter]]s, clock signals that regulate computers and [[quartz clock]]s, and the sounds produced by electronic beepers and [[video game]]s.<ref name=\"Snelgrove\" />\n\nOscillators are often characterized by the [[frequency]] of their output signal: \n*A [[low frequency oscillation|low-frequency oscillator]] (LFO) is an electronic oscillator that generates a frequency below \u224820&nbsp;Hz.  This term is typically used in the field of audio [[synthesizers]], to distinguish it from an audio frequency oscillator.\n*An audio oscillator<!--Please don't link - circular reference--> produces frequencies in the [[audio frequency|audio]] range, about 16&nbsp;Hz to 20&nbsp;kHz.<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" />\n*An RF oscillator produces signals in the [[radio frequency]] (RF) range of about 100&nbsp;kHz to 100&nbsp;GHz.<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" />\n\nOscillators designed to produce a high-power AC output from a DC supply are usually called [[Inverter (electrical)|inverters]].\n\nThere are two main types of electronic oscillator: the linear or harmonic oscillator and the nonlinear or [[relaxation oscillator]].<ref name=\"Chattopadhyay\" /><ref name=\"Garg\">{{cite book   \n  | last = Garg\n  | first = Rakesh Kumar  \n  | authorlink = \n  |author2=Ashish Dixit |author3=Pavan Yadav\n   | title = Basic Electronics\n  | publisher = Firewall Media\n  | year = 2008\n  | location = \n  | pages = 280\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9SOdnsHA2IYC&pg=PA280&lpg=PA280\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 8131803023}}</ref>\n\n====Latches and flip-flops====\n[[File:R-S mk2.gif|thumb|right|An SR latch, constructed from a pair of cross-coupled [[NOR gate|NOR]] [[logic gate|gates]].]][[File:JohnsonCounter2.png|thumb|border|A 4-bit [[ring counter]] using [[Flip-flop (electronics)#D flip-flop|D-type flip flops]]]]\n\nA latch or a [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] is a [[electronic circuit|circuit]] that has two stable states and can be used to store state information. They typically constructed using feedback that crosses over between two arms of the circuit, to provide the circuit with a state. The circuit can be made to change state by signals applied to one or more control inputs and will have one or two outputs. It is the basic storage element in [[sequential logic]]. Latches and flip-flops are fundamental building blocks of [[digital electronics]] systems used in computers, communications, and many other types of systems.\n\nLatches and flip-flops are used as data storage elements. Such data storage can be used for storage of ''[[state (computer science)|state]]'', and such a circuit is described as [[sequential logic]]. When used in a [[finite-state machine]], the output and next state depend not only on its current input, but also on its current state (and hence, previous inputs). It can also be used for counting of pulses, and for synchronizing variably-timed input signals to some reference timing signal.\n\nFlip-flops can be either simple (transparent or opaque) or [[clock signal|clock]]ed (synchronous or edge-triggered).  Although the term flip-flop has historically referred generically to both simple and clocked circuits, in modern usage it is common to reserve the term ''flip-flop'' exclusively for discussing clocked circuits; the simple ones are commonly called ''latches''.<ref name=\"pedroni\">\n{{cite book| author = Volnei A.

That is, when a latch is enabled it becomes transparent, while a flip flop's output only changes on a single type (positive going or negative going) of clock edge.\n\n===Software===\nFeedback loops provide generic mechanisms for controlling the running, maintenance, and evolution of software and computing systems.<ref name=\"Giese-at-al-engineering-saso-systems\">\n{{Cite news\n|author1=H.

For example,\n* When stocks are rising (a [[bull market]]), the belief that further rises are probable gives investors an incentive to buy (positive feedback\u2014reinforcing the rise, see also [[stock market bubble]]); but the increased price of the [[stock|shares]], and the [[knowledge]] that there must be a peak after which the market falls, ends up deterring buyers (negative feedback\u2014stabilizing the rise).\n* Once the market begins to fall regularly (a [[bear market]]), some investors may expect further losing days and refrain from buying (positive feedback\u2014reinforcing the fall), but others may buy because stocks become more and more of a bargain (negative feedback\u2014stabilizing the fall).\n\n[[George Soros]] used the word ''[[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]],'' to describe feedback in the financial markets and developed an [[investment]] theory based on this principle.\n\nThe conventional [[economic equilibrium]] model of [[supply and demand]] supports only ideal linear negative feedback and was heavily criticized by [[Paul Ormerod]] in his book ''[[The Death of Economics]]'', which, in turn, was criticized by traditional economists. This book was part of a change of perspective as economists started to recognise that [[chaos theory]] applied to nonlinear feedback systems including financial markets.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{cmn|2|\n*[[Audio feedback]]\n* [[Black box]] (see \"experiment model\")\n*[[Cybernetics]]\n*[[Feedback passivation]]\n*[[Feed forward (control)|Feed forward]]\n*[[Interaction]]\n*[[Low-key feedback]]\n*[[Optical feedback]]\n*[[Perverse incentive]]\n*[[Recursion]]\n*[[Resonance]]\n*[[Stability criterion]]\n*[[Strange loop]]\n*[[Tactile]]\n*[[Unintended consequence]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Katie Salen and [[Eric Zimmerman]].
