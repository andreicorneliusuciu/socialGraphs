It was designed and built by the [[Wright brothers]]. They flew it four times on December 17, 1903, near [[Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina|Kill Devil Hills]], about four miles south of [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina]], US. Today, the airplane is exhibited in the [[National Air and Space Museum]] in [[Washington D.C.]]\n\nThe U.S. [[Smithsonian Institution]] describes the aircraft as \"the first powered, heavier-than-air machine to achieve controlled, sustained flight with a pilot aboard\".<ref name=\"NASM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/exhibitions/gal100/wright1903.html|title=Exhibitions|publisher=}}</ref>  The flight of ''Flyer I'' marks the beginning of the [[Aviation in the pioneer era|\"pioneer era\"]] of aviation.\n\n==Design and construction==\n[[File:Wright brothers patent plans 1908.jpg|thumb|Patent plan]]\n\nThe ''Flyer'' was based on the Wrights' experience testing gliders at Kitty Hawk between 1900 and 1902. Their last glider, the [[1902 Wright Glider|1902 Glider]], led directly to the design of the ''Flyer''.\n\nThe Wrights built the aircraft in 1903 using [[Sitka Spruce|giant spruce]] wood as their construction material.<ref name=\"NASM\"/> The wings were designed with a 1-in-20 [[camber (aerodynamics)|camber]]. Since they could not find a suitable automobile engine for the task, they commissioned their employee [[Charlie Taylor (mechanic)|Charlie Taylor]] to build a new design from scratch, effectively a crude [[gasoline engine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/wright-brothers/online/fly/1903/engine.cfm|title=The Wright Brothers - Engine|publisher=}}</ref> A sprocket [[chain drive]], borrowing from [[bicycle]] technology, powered the twin [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]s, which were also made by hand.\n\nThe ''Flyer'' was a [[canard (aeronautics)|canard]] biplane configuration. As with the gliders, the pilot flew lying on his stomach on the lower wing with his head toward the front of the craft in an effort to reduce drag. He steered by moving a cradle attached to his hips. The cradle pulled wires which [[wing warping|warped the wings]] and turned the rudder simultaneously.\n\nThe ''Flyer's'' \"runway\" was a track of [[Dimensional lumber|2x4]]s stood on their narrow edge, which the brothers nicknamed the \"Junction Railroad\".\n\n===Flyer stability===\nThe Flyer was conceived as a control-canard, as the Wrights were more concerned with control than stability.<ref>{{Citation | last = Culick | title = AIAA-2001-3385 | quote = Consistently with ignoring the condition of zero net (pitch) moment, the Wrights assumed that in equilibrium the canard carried no load and served only as a control device.}}</ref> However, it was found to be so highly unstable that it was barely controllable.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Nasa | id = TM 88354 | title = A look at handling qualities of canard configurations | chapter = Wright Flyer | page = 8 | quote = ...the Flyer was highly unstable... The lateral/directional stability and control of the Flyer were marginal}}.</ref> Following the first flight, ballast was added to the nose to move the center of gravity forward and reduce pitch instability. However the basics of pitch stability of the canard configuration were not understood by the Wright Brothers.  F.E.C. Culick stated, \"The backward state of the general theory and understanding of flight mechanics hindered them... Indeed, the most serious gap in their knowledge was probably the basic reason for their unwitting mistake in selecting their canard configuration\".<ref name= Culick>{{citation |url = http://www.wrightflyer.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/The-First-Aeronautical-Engineers-and-Test-Pilots.pdf |title=Wright Brothers: First Aeronautical Engineers and Test Pilots | first = FEC | last = Culick |year=2001 |page=4 |format= PDF |quote= The backward state of the general theory and understanding of flight mechanics hindered them.}}</ref>\n\n==Flight trials at Kitty Hawk==\nUpon returning to Kitty Hawk in 1903, the Wrights completed assembly of the ''Flyer'' while practicing on the 1902 Glider from the previous season. On December 14, 1903, they felt ready for their first attempt at powered flight. With the help of men from the nearby government life-saving station, the Wrights moved the Flyer and its launching rail to the incline of a nearby sand dune, [[Wright Brothers National Memorial|Big Kill Devil Hill]], intending to make a gravity-assisted takeoff. The brothers tossed a coin to decide who would get the first chance at piloting, and Wilbur won. The airplane left the rail, but Wilbur pulled up too sharply, stalled, and came down in about three seconds with minor damage.\n\nRepairs after the abortive first flight took three days. When they were ready again on December 17, the wind was averaging more than 20&nbsp;mph, so the brothers laid the launching rail on level ground, pointed into the wind, near their camp. This time the wind, instead of an inclined launch, helped provide the necessary airspeed for takeoff. Because Wilbur had already had the first chance, Orville took his turn at the controls. His first flight lasted 12 seconds for a total distance of 120&nbsp;ft (36.5 m) \u2013 shorter than the wingspan of a [[Boeing 747]], as noted by observers in the 2003 commemoration of the first flight.<ref name=\"WDL\"/><ref>Lindberg, Mark. [http://www.wingsofhistory.org/index.php/library/articles-of-interest/mark-lindberg/a-century-of-flight \"Century of Flight.\"] ''Wings of History Museum,'' 2003. Retrieved: August 27, 2011.</ref>\n\nTaking turns, the Wrights made four brief, low-altitude flights that day. The flight paths were all essentially straight; turns were not attempted. Each flight ended in a bumpy and unintended \"landing\". The last flight, by Wilbur, was 852 feet (260 m) in 59 seconds, much longer than each of the three previous flights of 120, 175 and 200 feet. The landing broke the front elevator supports, which the Wrights hoped to repair for a possible four-mile (6&nbsp;km) flight to Kitty Hawk village. Soon after, a heavy gust picked up the Flyer and tumbled it end over end, damaging it beyond any hope of quick repair. It was never flown again.\n\n[[File:WrightFlyer4thFlight.jpg|thumb|left|700px|Distant view of the Wright airplane just after landing, taken from the starting point, with wing-rest in center of picture and launching rail at right. This flight, the fourth and final of December 17, 1903, was the longest: 852 feet covered in 59 seconds.<ref>http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2001696559/</ref><ref>[http://www.thewrightbrothers.org/fivefirstflights.html \"The Five First Flights.\"] ''thewrightbrothers.org.'' Retrieved: July 23, 2008</ref> Photo first published 1908]]{{Clear}}\nIn 1904, the Wrights continued refining their designs and piloting techniques in order to obtain fully controlled flight. Major progress toward this goal was achieved with a [[Wright Flyer II|new Flyer]] in 1904 and even more decisively in 1905 with a [[Wright Flyer III|third Flyer]], in which Wilbur made a 39-minute, {{convert|24|mi|km|sing=on}} nonstop circling flight on October 5.<ref name=\"test\">Crouch. Tom D. [http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2010/4/2010_4_68.shtml \"A Machine of Practical Utility.\"] ''American Heritage'', Winter 2010.</ref> While the 1903 Flyer was clearly a historically important test vehicle, its hallowed status in the American imagination has obscured the role of its two successors in the continuing development that led to the Wrights' mastery of controlled powered flight in 1905.\n\n==The influence of the Flyer==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}\n[[File:Orville Wright&flyer1909.jpg|thumb|280px|Orville Wright with a later [[Wright Model A|Model A]] Flyer at [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof Field]] in Berlin]]\nThe Flyer series of aircraft were the first to achieve controlled heavier-than-air flight, but some of the mechanical techniques the Wrights used to accomplish this were not influential for the development of aviation as a whole, although their theoretical achievements were. The Flyer design depended on [[wing-warping]] and a foreplane or \"canard\" for pitch control, features which would not scale and produced a hard-to-control aircraft. However, the Wrights' pioneering use of [[flight dynamics|\"roll control]]\" by twisting the wings to change wingtip angle in relation to the airstream \u2014 even with [[Aileron#History|a British patent of 1868 for such technology]]<ref name=\"GibbsLetter\">{{cite journal|journal=Flight |last=Gibbs-Smith |first= C.H. |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1956/1956%20-%200598.html |title=Correspondence: The First Aileron |date=11 May 1956 |page=598. |publisher=FlightGlobal.com }}</ref> that had apparently been completely forgotten by the time the 20th century had dawned \u2014 led directly to the more practical use of [[aileron]]s by their imitators, such as [[Glenn Curtiss|Curtiss]] and [[Henri Farman|Farman]]. The Wrights' original concept of simultaneous coordinated roll and yaw control (rear rudder deflection), which they discovered in 1902, perfected in 1903\u20131905, and patented in 1906, represents the solution to controlled flight and is used today on virtually every fixed-wing aircraft. The Wright patent included the use of hinged rather than warped surfaces for the forward elevator and rear rudder.  Other features that made the Flyer a success were highly efficient wings and propellers, which resulted from the Wrights' exacting wind tunnel tests and made the most of the marginal power delivered by their early \"homebuilt\" engines; slow flying speeds (and hence survivable accidents); and an incremental test/development approach. The future of aircraft design, however, lay with rigid wings, ailerons and rear control surfaces.\n\nAfter a single statement to the press in January 1904 and a failed public demonstration in May, the Wright Brothers did not publicize their efforts, and other aviators who were working on the problem of flight (notably [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]]) were thought by the press to have preceded them by many years. Indeed, several short heavier-than-air powered flights had been made by other aviators before 1903, leading to controversy about precedence (see [[Early flying machines]]). The Wrights, however, claimed to be the first of these which was \"properly controlled\".\n\nThe issue of control was correctly seen as critical by the Wrights, and they acquired a wide American patent intended to give them ownership of basic aerodynamic control, despite the brothers' (and others in [[Aviation in the pioneer era|pioneer aviation]] circles) likely complete lack of knowledge of [[Matthew Piers Watt Boulton#Aeronautical works|the aforementioned British technology patent from 1868]].<ref name=\"GibbsLetter\"/> This was fought in both American and European courts. European designers, however, were little affected by the litigation and continued their own development. The legal fight in the U.S., however, had a crushing effect on the nascent American aircraft industry, and by the time of World War I, the U.S. had no suitable military aircraft and had to purchase French and British models.\n\n==The ''Flyer'' after Kitty Hawk==\nThe Wright Brothers returned home to [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]] for Christmas after the flights of the ''Flyer''. While they had abandoned their other gliders, they realized the historical significance of the ''Flyer''. They shipped the heavily damaged craft back to Dayton, where it remained stored in crates behind a Wright Company shed for 9 years. The [[Great Dayton Flood]] of March 1913 covered the flyer in mud and water for 11 days.<ref name=\"wrightlibrary\">{{cite web|title=History of the 1903 Wright Flyer|url=http://www.libraries.wright.edu/special/wrightbrothers/flyer/history|website=www.libraries.wright.edu|publisher=Wright State University Libraries Special Collection & Archives}}</ref>\n\nCharlie Taylor relates in a 1948 article that the Flyer nearly got disposed of by the Wrights themselves. In early 1912 [[Roy Knabenshue]], The Wrights Exhibition team manager, had a conversation with Wilbur and asked Wilbur what they planned to do with the ''Flyer''. Wilbur said they most likely will burn it, as they had the 1904 machine. According to Taylor, Knabenshue talked Wilbur out of disposing of the machine for historical purposes.<ref>Taylor, Charles Edward. [http://www.aviationtoday.com/am/categories/military/615.html ''My Story''], as told to Robert S. Ball, ''Collier's'', 25 December 1948.</ref>\n\nIn 1910 the Wrights first made attempts to exhibit the ''Flyer'' in the Smithsonian Institution but talks fell through with the ensuing lawsuits against Glenn Curtiss and the ''Flyer'' may have been needed as repeated evidence in court cases. In 1916 as the patent fights were ending, Orville brought the ''Flyer'' out of storage and prepared it for display at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. (Wilbur had died in 1912.) He replaced parts of the wing covering, the props, and the engine's crankcase, crankshaft, and flywheel. The crankcase, crankshaft and flywheel of the original engine had been sent to the Aero Club of America in New York for an exhibit in 1906 and were never returned to the Wrights. The replacement crankcase, crankshaft and flywheel came from the experimental engine Charlie Taylor had built in 1904 and used for testing in the bicycle shop. A replica crankcase of the flyer is on display at the visitor center at the [[Wright Brothers National Memorial]].\n\n===Debate with the Smithsonian===\nThe [[Smithsonian Institution]], and primarily its then-secretary [[Charles Doolittle Walcott|Charles Walcott]], refused to give credit to the Wright Brothers for the first powered, controlled flight of an aircraft. Instead, they honored the former Smithsonian Secretary [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]], whose 1903 tests of his own [[Langley Aerodrome|Aerodrome]] on the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] were not successful. Walcott was a friend of Langley and wanted to see Langley's place in aviation history restored. In 1914, [[Glenn Curtiss]] had recently exhausted the appeal process in a patent infringement legal battle with the Wrights.  Curtiss sought to prove Langley's machine, which failed piloted tests nine days before the Wrights successful flight in 1903, capable of controlled, piloted flight in an attempt to invalidate the Wright's wide sweeping patents.\n\nThe Aerodrome was removed from exhibit at the Smithsonian and prepared for flight at  [[Keuka Lake, New York]].  Curtis called the preparations \"restoration\" claiming that the only addition to the design was pontoons to support testing on the lake but critics including patent attorney Griffith Brewer called them alterations of the original design.  Curtiss flew the modified ''Aerodrome'' hopping a few feet off the surface of the lake few no more than 5 seconds at at time.<ref>{{cite book| url= http://www.daytonhistorybooks.com/the_wright_brothers_19.html |title= The Wright Brothers| chapter= Chapter 19: Why The Wright Plane Was Exiled| publisher= Dayton History Books Online}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1916 and 1928 the flyer was prepared and assembled for exhibition under the supervision of Orville by Wright Company mechanic Jim Jacobs several times.  It was briefly exhibited at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1916, the New York Aero Shows in 1917 and 1919, a Society of Automotive Engineers meeting in Dayton, Ohio in 1918, and the [[National Air Races]] in Dayton in 1924.<ref name=\"SINASM\" />\n\n[[File:Wright_Flyer_at_the_Science_Museum_London.jpg|thumb|right|Wright Flyer was exhibited at the Science Museum, London 1928-1948]]\nIn 1925, Orville attempted to persuade the Smithsonian to recognize his and Wilbur's accomplishment by offering to send the ''Flyer'' to the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in [[London]]. This action did not have its intended effect, and the ''Flyer'' went on display in the London museum in 1928. It remained there in \"the place of honour\",<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1948/1948%20-%201791.html \"Back to the Beginning\"], ''Flight'', 28 October 1948, p.505.</ref> except during [[World War II]] when it was moved to an underground storage facility {{convert|100|mi|km}} from London, near the village of [[Corsham]].<ref name=\"SINASM\">{{cite web|title=1903 Wright Flyer|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/1903-wright-flyer?object=nasm_A19610048000|publisher=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum|date=21 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1942 the Smithsonian Institution, under a new secretary, [[Charles Greeley Abbot|Charles Abbot]], published a list of 35 Curtiss modifications to the ''Aerodrome'' and a retraction of its long-held claims for the craft.  Abbot went on to list 4 regrets including the role the Institution played in supporting unsuccessful defendants in patent litigation by the Wrights, misinformation about modifications made to the Aerodrome after Wright Flyer's first flight and public statements attributing the \"first aeroplane capable of sustained free flight with a man\" to Secretary Langley.  The entry in the 1942 Annual Report of Smithsonian Institution begins with the statement \"It is everywhere acknowledged that the Wright brothers were the first to make sustained flights in a heavier-than-air machine at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903\" and closes with a promise that \"Should Dr. Wright decide to deposit the plane ... it would be given the highest place of honor which it is due\"<ref>{{cite web|title=1942 Annual Report|url=http://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/annualreportofbo1942smit|publisher=Smithsonian Institution}}</ref> \n\nThe following year, Orville, after exchanging several letters with Abbott, agreed to return the ''Flyer'' to the United States. The ''Flyer'' stayed at the Science Museum until a replica could be built, based on the original. This change of heart by the Smithsonian is also mired in controversy \u2013 the Flyer was sold to the Smithsonian under several contractual conditions, one of which reads:\n\n{{quote|Neither the Smithsonian Institution or its successors, nor any museum or other agency, bureau or facilities administered for the United States of America by the Smithsonian Institution or its successors shall publish or permit to be displayed a statement or label in connection with or in respect of any aircraft model or design of earlier date than the Wright Aeroplane of 1903, claiming in effect that such aircraft was capable of carrying a man under its own power in controlled flight.<ref>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020817151648/glennhcurtiss.com/d93f42b0.jpg |date=August 17, 2002 |title=\"Archived image.\" }} ''Glenn H.

ISBN 3-922175-00-7.</ref>\n\nIn 1948 the official handover of the Flyer was made to the American Civil Air Attach\u00e9 at a ceremony attended by representatives of the various flying organizations in the UK and by some British aviation pioneers such as Sir [[Alliott Verdon-Roe]].<ref>\"Back to the Beginning\" ''Flight'' October 28th, 1948 p506</ref>\nLater in 1948, the ''Flyer'' was returned to the United States on board the ''[[RMS Mauretania (1938)|Mauretania]]''. When the liner docked at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], [[Paul E. Garber]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian's]] National Air Museum met the aircraft and took command of the proceedings.  The rest of the journey to Washington continued on flatbed truck. While in Halifax Garber met [[John A. D. McCurdy]], at the time the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia. McCurdy as a young man had been a member of Alexander Graham Bell's team Aerial Experiment Association, which included Glenn Curtiss, and later a famous pioneer pilot. During the stay at Halifax, Garber and McCurdy reminisced about the pioneer aviation days and the Wright Brothers. McCurdy also offered Garber any assistance he needed to get the ''Flyer'' home.<ref>Hallion 1978, p.55.</ref>\n\n===In the Smithsonian===\n[[File:WrightFlyerSmithsonianMay1982.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Flyer I'' as it appeared in 1982.]]\nThe ''Flyer'' was put on display in the Arts and Industries Building of the Smithsonian on December 17, 1948, 45 years to the day after the aircraft's only flights. (Orville did not live to see this, as he died in January of that year.) In 1976, it was moved to the Milestones of Flight Gallery of the new [[National Air and Space Museum]]. Since 2003 it has resided in a special exhibit in the museum titled \"The Wright Brothers and the Invention of the Aerial Age\", honoring the Wright Brothers in recognition of the 100th anniversary of their first flight.\n\nA piece of fabric and wood from the Wright Flyer was taken to the surface of the Moon by the crew of Apollo 11, the first lunar landing mission, in July 1969.<ref>[http://www.nasm.si.edu/events/pressroom/presskits/wrightbrothers/wbephotos.cfm \"Wright Flyer.\"] ''Smithsonian Institution.'' Retrieved: January 21, 2011.</ref>\n\n====1985 restoration====\n[[File:Wright Flyer photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|Wright Flyer I in the Smithsonian exhibit \"The Wright Brothers and the Invention of the Aerial Age\" - ''November 2014'']]\nIn 1981, discussion began on the need to restore the ''Flyer'' from the aging it sustained after many decades on display. During the ceremonies celebrating the 78th anniversary of the first flights, Mrs. Harold S. Miller (Ivonette Wright, Lorin's daughter), one of the Wright brothers' nieces, presented the Museum with the original covering of one wing of the ''Flyer'', which she had received in her inheritance from Orville. She expressed her wish to see the aircraft restored.\n\nThe fabric covering on the aircraft at the time, which came from the 1927 restoration, was discolored and marked with water spots. Metal fasteners holding the wing uprights together had begun to corrode, marking the nearby fabric.\n\nWork began in 1985. The restoration was supervised by Senior Curator Robert Mikesh and assisted by Wright Brothers expert Tom Crouch. Museum director [[Walter J. Boyne]] decided to perform the restoration in full view of the public.\n\nThe wooden framework was cleaned, and corrosion on metal parts removed. The covering was the only part of the aircraft replaced. The new covering was more accurate to the original than that of the 1927 restoration. To preserve the original paint on the engine, the restorers coated it in inert wax before putting on a new coat of paint.\n\nThe effects of the 1985 restoration were intended to last 75 years (to 2060) before another restoration would be required.<ref>Mikesh.</ref>\n\n==''Flyer'' reproductions==\nA number of individuals and groups have attempted to build reproductions of the Wright ''Flyer'' for demonstration or scientific purposes.\n\nIn 1978, 23-year-old Ken Kellett built a replica ''Flyer'' in Colorado and flew it at Kitty Hawk on the 75th and 80th anniversaries of the first flight there. Construction took a year and cost $3,000.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nAs the 100th anniversary on December 17, 2003 approached, the U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission along with other organizations opened bids for companies to recreate the original flight. The Wright Experience, led by Ken Hyde, won the bid and painstakingly recreated reproductions of the original ''Flyer'', plus many of the prototype gliders and kites as well as several subsequent Wright aircraft. The completed ''Flyer'' reproduction was brought to Kitty Hawk and pilot Kevin Kochersberger attempted to recreate the original flight at 10:35 AM December 17, 2003 on level ground near the bottom of Kill Devil Hill. Although the aircraft had previously made several successful test flights, sour weather, rain, and weak winds prevented a successful flight on the actual anniversary date.  Hyde's reproduction is displayed at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan.\n\nNumerous static display-only, nonflying reproductions are on display around the United States and across the world, making this perhaps the most reproduced single aircraft of the \"pioneer\" era in history, rivaling the number of copies \u2014 some of which are airworthy \u2014 of [[Louis Bl\u00e9riot]]'s cross-Channel [[Bleriot XI]] from 1909.\n<gallery class=\"center\" >\nFile:Wright Flyer wind-tunnel-large NASA.jpg|The [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|AIAA's]] ''Flyer'' reproduction undergoing testing in a [[NASA]] wind tunnel.\nFile:Wright Flyer Wind Tunnel NASA.jpg\nFile:15 23 1065 wright flyer replica.jpg|Wright Flyer Replica at the [[The Henry Ford|Henry Ford Museum]]\nFile:Frontiers of Flight Museum December 2015 109 (1903 Wright Flyer model).jpg|Flyer replica at the [[Frontiers of Flight Museum]]\nFile:1903 Wright Flyer Fleming.jpg|Wright 1903 Flyer replica at the Lysdale Historic Hangar[http://mn1903flyer.us]\n</gallery>\n\n==Artifacts==\nPortions of the original fabric and wood from the flyer traveled to the surface of the moon aboard the [[Apollo 11]] lunar module.
