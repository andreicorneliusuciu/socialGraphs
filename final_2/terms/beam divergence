The term is relevant only in the \"far field\", away from any [[focus (optics)|focus]] of the beam.  Practically speaking, however, the far field can commence physically close to the radiating aperture, depending on aperture diameter and the operating wavelength.\n\nBeam divergence is often used to characterize electromagnetic beams in the optical regime, for cases in which the aperture from which the beam emerges is very large with respect to the [[wavelength]]. However, it is also used in the Radio Frequency (RF) regime for cases in which the antenna is operating in the so-called optical region and is likewise very large relative to a wavelength.\n\nBeam divergence usually refers to a beam of circular cross section, but not necessarily so. A beam may, for example, have an elliptical cross section, in which case the orientation of the beam divergence must be specified, for example with respect to the major or minor axis of the elliptical cross section.\n\nThe divergence of a beam can be calculated if one knows the beam diameter at two separate points far from any focus (''D<sub>i</sub>'', ''D<sub>f</sub>''), and the distance (''l'') between these points. The beam divergence, <math>\\Theta</math>, is given by \n:<math>\\Theta=2 \\arctan\\left(\\frac{D_f-D_i}{2 l}\\right).</math>\n\nIf a collimated beam is focused with a [[lens (optics)|lens]], the diameter <math>D_m</math> of the beam in the rear focal plane of the lens is related to the divergence of the initial beam by \n:<math>\\Theta=\\frac{D_m}{f},\\,</math>\nwhere ''f'' is the focal length of the lens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uslasercorp.com/envoy/diverge.html |title=Measuring laser beam divergence |accessdate=March 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nLike all electromagnetic beams, [[laser]]s are subject to divergence, which is measured in [[milliradian]]s (mrad) or [[degree (angle)|degree]]s. For many applications, a lower-divergence beam is preferable. Neglecting divergence due to poor beam quality, the divergence of a laser beam is proportional to its wavelength and inversely proportional to the diameter of the beam at its narrowest point. For example, an ultraviolet laser that emits at a wavelength of 308&nbsp;nm will have a lower divergence than an infrared laser at 808&nbsp;nm, if both have the same minimum beam diameter. The divergence of good-quality laser beams is modeled using the mathematics of [[Gaussian beam]]s.\n\nGaussian laser beams are said to be [[diffraction limited]] when their radial beam divergence <math>\\theta=\\Theta/2</math> is close to the minimum possible value, which is given by<ref name= TLO>{{cite book |authorlink=F.

This type of beam divergence is observed from optimized laser cavities.  Information on the diffraction-limited divergence of a coherent beam is inherently given by the [[N-slit interferometric equation]].<ref name=TLO />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Laser beam profiler]]\n*[[Laser linewidth]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.pseudonomen.com/lasers/calculators Laser divergence calculator]\n*[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20100130141921/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/mechanical/mrl/ntm/level1/ch02/html/l1c02s02.html Interactive beam divergence graph]\n*[https://www.rp-photonics.com/beam_divergence.html]\n[[Category:Optics]]\n[[Category:Antennas (radio)]]"}]}}}}
