It is a specific type of [[Choke (electronics)|electronic choke]]. Ferrite beads employ high frequency current dissipation in a [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] ceramic to build high frequency noise suppression devices. Ferrite beads may also be called blocks, [[ferrite core|cores]], rings, EMI filters, or chokes.<ref name=\"slate\">{{Cite web\n| title = What Is That Little Cylinder on My Computer Wire?\n| work = Brow Beat blog\n| publisher = ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''\n| date = November 1, 2012\n| first = Mark\n| last = Vanhoenacker\n| accessdate = 2012-11-03\n| url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/11/01/cylinder_or_box_on_computer_cords_what_s_it_for.html\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What are the bumps at the end of computer cables?|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/question352.htm|website=HowStuffWorks|publisher=InfoSpace LLC|accessdate=21 April 2015|date=April 1, 2000}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nFerrite beads prevent interference in two directions: ''from'' a device or ''to'' a device.<ref name=\"slate\" /> A conductive cable acts as an antenna \u2013 if the device produces [[radio frequency]] energy, this can be ''transmitted'' through the cable, which acts as an [[unintentional radiator]]. In this case the bead is required for [[regulatory compliance]], to reduce [[Electromagnetic interference|EMI]]. Conversely, if there are other sources of EMI, such as household appliances, the bead prevents the cable from acting as an antenna and ''receiving'' interference from these other devices. This is particularly common on data cables and on medical equipment.<ref name=\"slate\" />\n\nLarge ferrite beads are commonly seen on external cabling. Various smaller ferrite beads are used internally in circuits\u2014on conductors or around the pins of small circuit-board components, such as transistors, connectors and [[integrated circuit]]s.\n\nFerrite beads are used as [[inductor]]s to form a [[passive filter|passive]] [[low-pass filter]]. The geometry and electromagnetic properties of coiled wire over the ferrite bead result in an [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] for high-frequency signals, attenuating high frequency [[electromagnetic interference|EMI]]/[[radio frequency interference|RFI]] electronic noise. The energy is either reflected back up the cable, or dissipated as low level heat. Only in extreme cases is the heat noticeable.\n\nA pure inductor does not dissipate energy but it produces [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] that impedes the flow of higher frequency signals.  This reactance is commonly referred to simply as ''impedance'', although [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] can be any combination of resistance and reactance.\n\nA ferrite core or bead can be added to an inductor to improve, in two ways, its ability to block [[Electromagnetic interference|unwanted high frequency]] noise.  First, the ferrite concentrates the magnetic field, increases inductance and therefore reactance, which impedes or \u2018filters out\u2019 the noise. Second, if the ferrite is so designed, it can produce an additional loss in the form of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] in the ferrite itself.  The ferrite creates an inductor with a very low  [[inductor#Q factor|Q factor]].<ref name=Carr02>{{Cite book|first=Joseph J. |last=Carr |title=RF Components and Circuits |publisher=Newnes |date=2002 |isbn=978-0-7506-4844-8 |pages=264-266}}</ref>  This loss heats the ferrite, but normally it is a negligible amount of heat. While the signal level is large enough to cause interference, or undesirable effects in sensitive circuits, the energy blocked is typically quite small. Depending on the application, the resistive loss characteristic of the ferrite may or may not be desired.\n\nA design that uses a ferrite bead to improve noise filtering must take into account specific circuit characteristics and the frequency range to block. Different ferrite materials have different properties with respect to frequency, and manufacturer's literature helps select the most effective material for the frequency range.<ref name=Carr02/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Crowell|first1=Benjamin|title=Simple Nature|url=http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/0sn/ch11/ch11.html#Section11.7|accessdate=21 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nFerrite beads are one of the simplest and least expensive types of interference filters to install on preexisting electronic cabling. For a simple ferrite ring, the wire is simply wrapped around the core through the center, typically five or seven times. Clamp-on cores are also available, which attach without wrapping the wire: this type of ferrite core is usually designed so that the wire passes only once through it. If the fit is not snug enough, the core can be secured with [[cable tie]]s or, if the center is large enough, the cabling can loop through one or more times. Small ferrite beads can be slipped over component leads to suppress [[parasitic oscillation]].<ref name=Carr02/>\n\nSurface-mount ferrite beads are available. These are soldered into a gap in the printed circuit board trace, just like any other surface mount inductor. Inside the bead component, a coil of wire runs between layers of ferrite to form a multi-turn inductor around the high permeability core.<ref>[http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/data/inductors/ferrite-bead-inductors.php Ferrite Bead Inductors - Radio-Electronics.com]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Balun]]\n* [[Electromagnetic interference]]\n* [[Magnetic core]]\n* [[Toroidal inductors and transformers]]\n* [[Unintentional radiator]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Ferrite beads}}\n* [http://www.electricaltechnology.org/2014/11/ferrite-bead-tiny-cylinder-power-cords-cable.html Ferrite Bead: Tiny Cylinder in Power Cords & Cable.
