The movement of a body, or link, is studied using geometry so the link is considered to be rigid.<ref>P. Moubarak, P. Ben-Tzvi, \"On the Dual-Rod Slider Rocker Mechanism and Its Applications to Tristate Rigid Active Docking,\" ASME Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics, 5 (1) (2013) 011010</ref>  The connections between links are modeled as providing ideal movement, pure rotation or sliding for example, and are called joints.  A linkage modeled as a network of rigid links and ideal joints is called a [[kinematic chain]].\n\nLinkages may be constructed from open chains, closed chains, or a combination of open and closed chains.  Each link in a chain is connected by a joint to one or more other links.  Thus, a kinematic chain can be modeled as a graph in which the links are paths and the joints are vertices, which is called a linkage graph.\n\n[[File:Pantograph Mirror.gif|thumb|The deployable mirror linkage is constructed from a series of rhombus or scissor linkages.]]\n[[File:Hebebuehne Scissorlift.jpg|thumb|An extended [[scissor lift]]]]\nThe movement of an ideal joint is generally associated with a subgroup of the group of Euclidean displacements.  The number of parameters in the subgroup is called the [[degree of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] (DOF) of the joint.\nMechanical linkages are usually designed to transform a given input force and movement into a desired output force and movement.  The ratio of the output force to the input force is known as the [[mechanical advantage]] of the linkage, while the ratio of the input speed to the output speed is known as the [[Gear ratio#Speed ratio|speed ratio]].  The speed ratio and mechanical advantage are defined so they yield the same number in an ideal linkage.\n\nA kinematic chain, in which one link is fixed or stationary, is called a mechanism,<ref>OED</ref> and a linkage designed to be stationary is called a '''structure'''.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Linkage spacial 3DOFL.gif|thumb|A spatial 3 DOF linkage for joystick applications.]]\n\nPerhaps the simplest linkage is the [[lever]], which is a link that pivots around a [[wikt:fulcrum|fulcrum]] attached to ground, or a fixed point.  As a force rotates the lever, points far from the fulcrum have a greater velocity than points near the fulcrum.  Because [[Power (physics)|power]] into the lever equals the power out, a small force applied at a point far from the fulcrum (with greater velocity) equals a larger force applied at a point near the fulcrum (with less velocity).  The amount the force is amplified is called [[mechanical advantage]].  This is the law of the lever.\n\nTwo levers connected by a rod so that a force applied to one is transmitted to the second is known as a [[four-bar linkage]].  The levers are called [[crank (mechanism)|cranks]], and the fulcrums are called pivots.  The connecting rod is also called the coupler.  The fourth bar in this assembly is the ground, or frame, on which the cranks are mounted.\n\nLinkages are important components of [[machine (mechanical)|machines]] and [[tool]]s.  Examples range from the four-bar linkage used to amplify force in a [[bolt cutter]] or to provide independent [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] in an automobile, to complex linkage systems in [[robot|robotic arms]] and walking machines. The [[internal combustion engine]] uses a slider-crank four-bar linkage formed from its [[piston]], [[connecting rod]], and [[crankshaft]] to transform power from expanding burning gases into rotary power.  Relatively simple linkages are often used to perform complicated tasks.\n\nInteresting examples of linkages include the [[windshield wiper]], the [[bicycle suspension]],  and [[hydraulic cylinder|hydraulic actuators]] for [[heavy equipment]].  In these examples the components in the linkage move in parallel planes and are called \"planar linkages.\"                             A linkage with at least one link that moves in three-dimensional space is called a \"spatial linkage.\"  The skeletons of robotic systems are examples of spatial linkages.  The geometric design of these systems relies on modern [[computer aided design]] software.\n\nThe [[4-bar linkage]] is an adapted mechanical linkage used on bicycles. With a normal full-suspension bike the back wheel moves in a very tight arc shape. This means that more power is lost when going uphill.{{clarify|date=December 2012|reason=Why}} With a bike fitted with a 4-bar linkage, the wheel moves in such a large arc that it is moving almost vertically. This way the power loss is reduced by up to 30%.\n\n==History==\n[[Archimedes]]<ref>T. Koetsier, \"From Kinematically Generated Curves to Instantaneous Invariants: Episodes in the History of Instantaneous Planar Kinematics,\" Mechanism and Machine Theory, 21(6):489- 498, 1986</ref> applied geometry to the study of the lever.  Into the 1500s the work of Archimedes and [[Hero of Alexandria]] were the primary sources of machine theory.  It was [[Leonardo da Vinci]] who brought an inventive energy to machines and mechanism.<ref>A. P. Usher, 1929, A History of Mechanical Inventions, Harvard University Press, (reprinted by Dover Publications 1968)</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1700s the [[Watt steam engine|steam engine]] was of growing importance, and [[James Watt]] realized that efficiency could be increased by using different cylinders for expansion and condensation of the steam.  This drove his search for a linkage that could transform rotation of a crank into a linear slide, and resulted in his discovery of what is called [[Watt's linkage]].  This led to the study of linkages that could generate straight lines, even if only approximately; and inspired the mathematician [[J. J. Sylvester]], who lectured on the [[Peaucellier linkage]], which generates an exact straight line from a rotating crank.<ref name=\"C. Moon, 2009\">F. C.

These techniques are also being applied to biological systems and even the study of proteins.\n\n== Mobility ==\n[[File:4 bar linkage animated.gif|thumb|Simple linkages are capable of producing complicated motion.]]\n\nThe configuration of a system of rigid links connected by ideal joints is defined by a set of configuration parameters, such as the angles around a revolute joint and the slides along prismatic joints measured between adjacent links.  The geometric constraints of the linkage allow calculation of all of the configuration parameters in terms of a minimum set, which are the ''input parameters''.  The number of input parameters is called the ''mobility'', or [[degree of freedom (mechanics)|degree of freedom]], of the linkage system.\n\nA system of ''n'' rigid bodies moving in space has ''6n'' degrees of freedom measured relative to a fixed frame.  Include this frame in the count of bodies, so that mobility is independent of the choice of the fixed frame, then we have M=6(N-1), where N=n+1 is the number of moving bodies plus the fixed body.\n\nJoints that connect bodies in this system remove degrees of freedom and reduce mobility. Specifically, hinges and sliders each impose five constraints and therefore remove five degrees of freedom.  It is convenient to define the number of constraints ''c'' that a joint imposes in terms of the joint's freedom ''f'', where ''c=6-f''.  In the case of a hinge or slider, which are one degree of freedom joints, we have ''f=1'' and therefore ''c=6-1=5''.\n\nThus, the mobility of a linkage system formed from ''n'' moving links and ''j'' joints each with ''f<sub>i</sub>'', ''i=1, ..., j,''  degrees of freedom can be computed as,\n:<math>M = 6n - \\sum_{i=1}^j (6 - f_i) =  6(N-1 - j) + \\sum_{i=1}^j\\ f_i,</math>\nwhere ''N'' includes the fixed link.  This is known as [[Chebychev\u2013Gr\u00fcbler\u2013Kutzbach criterion|Kutzbach-Gruebler's equation]]\n\nThere are two important special cases: (i) a simple open chain, and (ii) a simple closed chain. A simple open chain consists of ''n'' moving links connected end to end by ''j'' joints, with one end connected to a ground link.  Thus, in this case ''N=j+1''  and the mobility of the chain is\n:<math> M = \\sum_{i=1}^j\\ f_i .</math>\nFor a simple closed chain, ''n'' moving links are connected end-to-end by ''n+1'' joints such that the two ends are connected to the ground link forming a loop.  In this case, we have ''N=j'' and the mobility of the chain is\n:<math> M = \\sum_{i=1}^j\\ f_i - 6.</math>\n\nAn example of a simple open chain is a serial robot manipulator.  These robotic systems are constructed from a series of links connected by six one degree-of-freedom revolute or prismatic joints, so the system has six degrees of freedom.\n\nAn example of a simple closed chain is the RSSR spatial four-bar linkage.  The sum of the freedom of these joints is eight, so the mobility of the linkage is two, where one of the degrees of freedom is the rotation of the coupler around the line joining the two S joints.\n\n=== Planar and spherical movement ===\n[[File:Linkage mobility.png|thumb|Linkage mobility]]\n[[File:Locking pliers.jpg|thumb|Locking [[Pliers (tool)|pliers]] exemplify a four-bar, one [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degree of freedom]] mechanical linkage.  The adjustable base pivot makes this a two degree-of-freedom five-bar linkage.]]\n\nIt is common practice to design the linkage system so that the movement of all of the bodies are constrained to lie on parallel planes, to form what is known as a ''planar linkage''. It is also possible to construct the linkage system so that all of the bodies move on concentric spheres, forming a ''spherical linkage''.  In both cases, the degrees of freedom of the link is now three rather than six, and the constraints imposed by joints are now ''c=3-f''.\n\nIn this case, the mobility formula is given by\n:<math>M = 3(N- 1 - j)+ \\sum_{i=1}^j\\ f_i, </math>\nand we have the special cases,\n* planar or spherical simple open chain,\n:<math> M = \\sum_{i=1}^j\\ f_i, </math>\n* planar or spherical simple closed chain,\n:<math> M = \\sum_{i=1}^j\\ f_i - 3. </math>\nAn example of a planar simple closed chain is the planar four-bar linkage, which is a four-bar loop with four one degree-of-freedom joints and therefore has mobility M=1.\n\n== Joints ==\nThe most familiar joints for linkage systems are the [[revolute joint|revolute]], or hinged, joint denoted by an R, and the [[prismatic joint|prismatic]], or sliding, joint denoted by a P.  Most other joints used for spatial linkages are modeled as combinations of revolute and prismatic joints.  For example,\n*  the cylindric joint consists of an RP or PR serial chain constructed so that the axes of the revolute and prismatic joints are parallel,\n*  the [[spherical joint]] consists of an RRR serial chain for which each of the hinged joint axes intersect in the same point;\n*  the planar joint can be constructed either as a planar RRR, RPR, and PPR serial chain that has three degrees-of-freedom.\n\n== Analysis and synthesis of linkages ==\nThe primary mathematical tool for the analysis of a linkage is known as the kinematics equations of the system.  This is a sequence of rigid body transformation along a serial chain within the linkage that locates a floating link relative to the ground frame. Each serial chain within the linkage that connects this floating link to ground provides a set of equations that must be satisfied by the configuration parameters of the system.  The result is a set of non-linear equations that define the configuration parameters of the system for a set of values for the input parameters.\n\n[[Ferdinand Freudenstein|Freudenstein]] introduced a method to use these equations for the design of a planar four-bar linkage to achieve a specified relation between the input parameters and the configuration of the linkage.  Another approach to planar four-bar linkage design was introduced by [[Ludwig Burmester|L. Burmester]], and is called [[Burmester theory]].\n\n== Planar one degree-of-freedom linkages ==\nThe mobility formula provides a way to determine the number of links and joints in a planar linkage that yields a one degree-of-freedom linkage.  If we require the mobility of a planar linkage to be M=1 and f<sub>i</sub>=1, the result is\n:<math> M = 3(N-1-j) + j = 1, \\!</math>\nor\n:<math> j =  (3/2)N - 2. \\!</math>\n\nThis formula shows that the linkage must have an even number of links, so we have\n* N=2, j=1: this is a two-bar linkage known as the [[lever]];\n* N=4, j=4: this is the [[four-bar linkage]];\n* N=6, j=7: this is a [[six-bar linkage]] [ it has two links that have three joints, called ternary links, and there are two topologies of this linkage depending how these links are connected.  In the Watt topology, the two ternary links are connected by a joint.  In the Stephenson topology the two ternary links are connected by binary links;<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X0AHKxwWTsYC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107&dq=tsai,+enumeration&source=bl&ots=KsaVQo-N-Z&sig=xUPIkQcpC8ldoxjAJeVifSK2MRY&hl=en&ei=j4oSTpO2FcfYiAKu1ejdDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=L.

It is a one degree-of-freedom system that transforms an input crank rotation or slider displacement into an output rotation or slide.\n[[File:Linkage four bar.png|thumb|Types of four-bar linkages, s = shortest link, l = longest link]]\n\nExamples of four-bar linkages are:\n*  the crank-rocker, in which the input crank fully rotates and the output link rocks back and forth;\n*  the slider-crank, in which the input crank rotates and the output slide moves back and forth;\n*  drag-link mechanisms, in which the input crank fully rotates and drags the output crank in a fully rotational movement.\n\n==Other interesting linkages==\n[[File:Linkage function generator svg.svg|thumb|A function generator linkage that approximates a [[Parabola|parabolic]] output.]]\n\n* [[Pantograph]] (four-bar, two DOF)\n* Five bar linkages often have meshing gears for two of the links, creating a one DOF linkage. They can provide greater power transmission with more design flexibility than four-bar linkages.\n* [[Jansen's linkage]] is a twelve-bar [[Leg mechanism]] that was invented by kinetic sculptor [[Theo Jansen]].\n* [[Klann linkage]] is a six-bar linkage that forms the leg of a walking mechanism;\n* Toggle mechanisms are four-bar linkages that are dimensioned so that they can fold and lock. The toggle positions are determined by the colinearity of two of the moving links.<ref>Robert L. Norton; Design of Machinery 5th Addition</ref> The linkage is dimensioned so that the linkage reaches a toggle position just before it folds.  The high mechanical advantage allows the input crank to deform the linkage just enough to push it beyond the toggle position.  This locks the input in place.  Toggle mechanisms are used as clamps.\n\n=== Straight line mechanisms ===\n{{main article|Straight line mechanism}}\n* James Watt's [[parallel motion]] and [[Watt's linkage]]\n* [[Peaucellier\u2013Lipkin linkage]], the first planar linkage to create a perfect straight line output from rotary input; eight-bar, one DOF.\n* A [[Scott Russell linkage]], which converts linear motion, to (almost) linear motion in a line perpendicular to the input.\n* [[Chebyshev linkage]], which provides nearly straight motion of a point with a four-bar linkage.\n* [[Hoekens linkage]], which provides nearly straight motion of a point with a four-bar linkage.\n* [[Sarrus linkage]], which provides motion of one surface in a direction normal to another.\n* [[Hart's inversor]], which provides a perfect straight line motion without sliding guides.<ref name=Dijksman>{{cite web |url=http://alexandria.tue.nl/repository/freearticles/603890.pdf |title=True straight-line linkages having a rectlinear translating bar}}</ref>\n\n===Biological linkages===\nLinkage systems are widely distributed in animals.

A well-known example is the [[cruciate ligament]]s of the knee.\n\nAn important difference between biological and engineering linkages is that revolving bars are rare in biology and that usually only a small range of the theoretically possible is possible due to additional mechanical constraints (especially the necessity to deliver blood).<ref name = dawkins>{{cite news  | last = Dawkins  | first = Richard  | authorlink = Richard Dawkins  | title = Why don't animals have wheels?  | work = [[Sunday Times]]  | date = November 24, 1996  | url = http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Articles/1996-11-24wheels.shtml  | accessdate = 2008-10-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070221073440/www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/dawkins/WorldOfDawkins-archive/Dawkins/Work/Articles/1996-11-24wheels.shtml |archivedate = February 21, 2007}}</ref> Biological linkages frequently are [[compliant mechanism|compliant]]. Often one or more bars are formed by ligaments, and often the linkages are three-dimensional. Coupled linkage systems are known, as well as five-, six-, and even seven-bar linkages.<ref name = muller/> [[Four-bar linkage]]s are by far the most common though.\n\nLinkages can be found in joints, such as the [[cruciate ligament|knee]] of [[tetrapod]]s, the hock of [[sheep]], and the cranial mechanism of [[bird]]s and [[reptile]]s. The latter is responsible for the upward motion of the upper bill in many birds.\n\nLinkage mechanisms are especially frequent and manifold in the head of [[bony fishes]], such as [[wrasses]], which have [[evolution|evolved]] many specialized [[Aquatic predation|feeding mechanisms]]. Especially advanced are the linkage mechanisms of [[Aquatic predation#Protrusion|jaw protrusion]]. For [[suction feeding]] a system of linked four-bar linkages is responsible for the coordinated opening of the mouth and 3-D expansion of the buccal cavity. Other linkages are responsible for [[Aquatic predation#Protrusion|protrusion]] of the [[premaxilla]].\n\nLinkages are also present as locking mechanisms, such as in the knee of the horse, which enables the animal to sleep standing, without active muscle contraction. In [[Aquatic predation#Pivot feeding|pivot feeding]], used by certain bony fishes, a four-bar linkage at first locks the head in a ventrally bent position by the alignment of two bars. The release of the locking mechanism jets the head up and moves the mouth toward the prey within 5\u201310 ms.\n\n==Image gallery==\n<ref>{{cite book|last=Simionescu|first=P.A.|title=Computer Aided Graphing and Simulation Tools for AutoCAD users|year=2014|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-1-4822-5290-3|edition=1st}}</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:Func Geen Log(u).gif|Four-bar function generator of the function Log(u) for 1 < u < 10.\nFile:RRRT Func Geen Log(u).gif|Rocker-slider function generator of the function Log(u) for 1 < u < 10.\nFile:TRRR Func Geen Tan(u).gif|Slider-rocker function generator of the function Tan(u) for 0 < u < 45\u00b0.\nFile:Four-bar fixed and moving centrodes.gif|Fixed and moving centrodes of a four-bar linkage\nFile:Gear-5-bar-left2.gif|Gear 5-bar left-hand closure\nFile:Gear-5-bar-right2.gif|Gear 5-bar right-hand closure\nFile:Rack-and-pinion_4_bar.gif|Rack-and-pinion four-bar linkage\nFile:RTRTR 1.gif|RTRTR mechanism\nFile:RTRTR 2.gif|RTRTR mechanism\nFile:Gear_5-bar_linkage.gif|Gear five-bar mechanisms\nFile:3D slider-crank mechanism.gif|3D slider-crank mechanism\n\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin||22em}}\n* [[Cam]]\n* [[dwell mechanism]]\n* [[Engineering mechanics]]\n* [[Kinematic coupling]]\n* [[Kinematic pair]]s\n* [[Kinematics]]\n* Kinematic models in [[Mathcad]]<ref>{{cite web|author={{subject}} |url=http://communities.ptc.com/groups/kinematic-models-in-mathcad |title=PTC Community: Group: Kinematic models in Mathcad |publisher=Communities.ptc.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}</ref>\n* [[Lever]]\n* [[Function generator#Mechanical function generators|Mechanical function generator]]\n* [[Machine (mechanical)|Machine]]\n* [[Outline of machines]]\n* [[Overconstrained mechanism]]\n* [[Parallel motion]]\n* [[Reciprocating motion]]\n* [[Three-point hitch]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bryant|first=John|title=How round is your circle? : where engineering and mathematics meet|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-691-13118-4|page=306|author2=Sangwin, Chris }}&nbsp;\u2014 Connections between mathematical and real-world mechanical models, historical development of precision machining, some practical advice on fabricating physical models, with ample illustrations and photographs\n* {{cite book |author1=Erdman, Arthur G. |author2=Sandor, George N. | title=Mechanism Design: Analysis and Synthesis | publisher=Prentice-Hall | year=1984 | isbn=0-13-572396-5}}\n* Hartenberg, R.S. & J.
