Integrated Darlington pairs come packaged singly in transistor-like packages or as an array of devices (usually eight) in an [[integrated circuit]].\n\nThe Darlington configuration was invented by [[Bell Laboratories]] engineer [[Sidney Darlington]] in 1953. He [[patent]]ed the invention of having two or three transistors on a single chip sharing a collector.<ref name=\"DarlContrib\">[http://andros.eecs.berkeley.edu/~hodges/DarlingtonCircuit.pdf Darlington's Contributions to Transistor Circuit Design]</ref>\n\nA similar configuration but with transistors of opposite type (one NPN and one PNP) is the [[Sziklai pair]], sometimes called the \"complementary Darlington\".\n\n==Behavior==\n[[File:Darlington transistor MJ1000.jpg|thumbnail|View of the chip in an MJ1000]]\nA Darlington pair behaves like a single transistor with a high current gain (approximately the product of the gains of the two transistors). In fact, integrated devices have three leads (B, C, and E), broadly equivalent to those of a standard transistor.\n\nA general relation between the compound current gain and the individual gains is given by:\n:<math>\\beta_\\mathrm{Darlington} = \\beta_1 \\cdot \\beta_2 + \\beta_1 + \\beta_2</math>\n\nIf ''\u03b2<sub>1</sub>'' and ''\u03b2<sub>2</sub>'' are high enough (hundreds), this relation can be approximated with:\n:<math>\\beta_\\mathrm{Darlington} \\approx \\beta_1 \\cdot \\beta_2</math>\n\nDarlington pairs are available as integrated packages or can be made from two discrete transistors; Q<sub>1</sub> (the left-hand transistor in the diagram) can be a low power type, but normally Q<sub>2</sub> (on the right) will need to be high power. The maximum collector current I<sub>C</sub>(max) of the pair is that of Q<sub>2</sub>. A typical integrated power device is the 2N6282, which includes a switch-off resistor and has a current gain of 2400 at I<sub>C</sub>=10A.\n\nA Darlington pair can be sensitive enough to respond to the current passed by skin contact even at safe voltages. Thus it can form the input stage of a touch-sensitive switch.\n\nDarlington transistors can be used in circuits involving motors, relays, or other current-hungry components connected to computers. The current is amplified from the normal low level of the computer output line to the amount needed by the connected device.\n\nA typical modern device has a current gain of 1000 or more, so that only a small base current is needed to make the pair switch on. However, this high current gain comes with several drawbacks.\n\n==Disadvantages==\nOne drawback is an approximate doubling of the base\u2013emitter voltage. Since there are two junctions between the base and emitter of the Darlington transistor, the equivalent base\u2013emitter voltage is the sum of both base\u2013emitter voltages:\n:<math>V_{BE} = V_{BE1} + V_{BE2} \\approx 2V_{BE1}\\!</math>\nFor silicon-based technology, where each V<sub>BEi</sub> is about 0.65 V when the device is operating in the active or saturated region, the necessary base\u2013emitter voltage of the pair is 1.3 V.\n\nAnother drawback of the Darlington pair is its increased \"saturation\" voltage. The output transistor is not allowed to saturate (i.e. its base\u2013collector junction must remain reverse-biased) because the first transistor, when saturated, establishes full (100%) parallel negative feedback between the collector and the base of the second transistor.<ref> Similarly, an [[emitter follower]] never saturates because of the 100% series negative feedback. Another example is an \"active diode\" made by a transistor with joined base and collector (e.g., the current-setting part of a [[current mirror]]).</ref> Since collector\u2013emitter voltage is equal to the sum of its own base\u2013emitter voltage and the collector-emitter voltage of the first transistor, both positive quantities in normal operation, it always exceeds the base-emitter voltage. (In symbols, <math>\\mathrm{V_{CE2} = V_{CE1} + V_{BE2} > V_{BE2}} \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{V_{C2} > V_{B2}}</math> always.) Thus the \"saturation\" voltage of a Darlington transistor is one V<sub>BE</sub> (about 0.65 V in silicon) higher than a single transistor saturation voltage, which is typically 0.1 - 0.2 V in silicon. For equal collector currents, this drawback translates to an increase in the dissipated power for the Darlington transistor over a single transistor. The increased low output level can cause troubles when TTL logic circuits are driven.\n\nAnother problem is a reduction in switching speed or response, because the first transistor cannot actively inhibit the base current of the second one, making the device slow to switch off. To alleviate this, the second transistor often has a resistor of a few hundred ohms connected between its base and emitter terminals.<ref name=TAoE/> This resistor provides a low-impedance discharge path for the charge accumulated on the base-emitter junction, allowing a faster transistor turn-off.\n\nThe Darlington pair has more phase shift at high frequencies than a single transistor and hence can more easily become unstable with [[negative feedback]] (i.e., systems that use this configuration can have poor [[phase margin]] due to the extra transistor delay).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Insulated-gate bipolar transistor]]\n*[[Sziklai pair]]\n*[[ULN2003A]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{US patent|2663806}} \"Semiconductor signal translating device\" (Darlington transistor)\n*[https://www.eleinmec.com/article.asp?13 A Darlington pair motor speed control circuit]\n*[http://www.tedpavlic.com/teaching/osu/ece327/lab7_proj/lab7_proj_procedure.pdf ECE 327: Procedures for Output Filtering Lab]&nbsp;&ndash; Section 4 (\"Power Amplifier\") discusses Darlington pairs in the design of a BJT-based class-AB current driver in detail.\n\n{{Transistor amplifiers}}\n{{Electronic component}}\n\n[[Category:Multi-stage transistor amplifiers]]\n[[Category:Transistor types]]"}]}}}}
