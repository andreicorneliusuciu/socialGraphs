In [[Albert Einstein]]'s original pedagogical treatment, it is based on two postulates:\n\n# The laws of physics are [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] (i.e. identical) in all [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial systems]] (non-accelerating frames of reference).\n# The speed of light in a [[vacuum]] is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source.\n\nIt was originally proposed in 1905 by Albert Einstein in the paper \"[[Annus Mirabilis Papers#Special relativity|On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies]]\".<ref name=\"electro\">[[Albert Einstein]] (1905) \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20050220050316/http://www.pro-physik.de/Phy/pdfs/ger_890_921.pdf ''Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K\u00f6rper'']\", ''Annalen der Physik'' 17: 891; English translation [http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/ On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies] by [[George Barker Jeffery]] and Wilfrid Perrett (1923); Another English translation [[s:On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies|On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies]] by [[Megh Nad Saha]] (1920).</ref> The inconsistency of [[Newtonian mechanics]] with [[Maxwell\u2019s equations]] of [[electromagnetism]] and the lack of experimental confirmation for a hypothesized [[luminiferous aether]] led to the development of special relativity, which corrects mechanics to handle situations involving motions nearing the speed of light. As of today, special relativity is the most accurate model of motion at any speed. Even so, the Newtonian mechanics model is still useful (due to its simplicity and high accuracy) as an approximation at small velocities relative to the speed of light.\n\nSpecial relativity implies a wide range of consequences, which have been experimentally verified,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edu-observatory.org/physics-faq/Relativity/SR/experiments.html |title=What is the experimental basis of Special Relativity? |accessdate=2008-09-17 |author1=Tom Roberts  |author2=Siegmar Schleif  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=October 2007 |work=Usenet Physics FAQ}}</ref> including [[length contraction]], [[time dilation]], [[Mass in special relativity|relativistic mass]], [[mass\u2013energy equivalence]], [[Speed of light#Upper limit on speeds|a universal speed limit]] and [[relativity of simultaneity]].

The longer and the more desperately I tried, the more I came to the conviction that only the discovery of a universal formal principle could lead us to assured results... How, then, could such a universal principle be found?|Albert Einstein: ''Autobiographical Notes''<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Einstein, Autobiographical Notes, 1949.</ref>}}\n\nEinstein discerned two fundamental propositions that seemed to be the most assured, regardless of the exact validity of the (then) known laws of either mechanics or electrodynamics. These propositions were the constancy of the speed of light and the independence of physical laws (especially the constancy of the speed of light) from the choice of inertial system. In his initial presentation of special relativity in 1905 he expressed these postulates as:<ref name=electro />\n* The Principle of Relativity \u2013 The laws by which the states of physical systems undergo change are not affected, whether these changes of state be referred to the one or the other of two systems in uniform translatory motion relative to each other.<ref name=electro />\n* The Principle of Invariant Light Speed \u2013 \"... light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity [speed] ''c'' which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body\" (from the preface).<ref name=electro /> That is, light in vacuum propagates with the speed ''c'' (a fixed constant, independent of direction) in at least one system of inertial coordinates (the \"stationary system\"), regardless of the state of motion of the light source.\n\nThe derivation of special relativity depends not only on these two explicit postulates, but also on several tacit assumptions ([[Duhem\u2013Quine thesis|made in almost all theories of physics]]), including the [[isotropy]] and [[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] of space and the independence of measuring rods and clocks from their past history.<ref>Einstein, \"Fundamental Ideas and Methods of the Theory of Relativity\", 1920</ref>\n\nFollowing Einstein's original presentation of special relativity in 1905, many different sets of postulates have been proposed in various alternative derivations.<ref>For a survey of such derivations, see Lucas and Hodgson, Spacetime and Electromagnetism, 1990</ref> However, the most common set of postulates remains those employed by Einstein in his original paper. A more mathematical statement of the Principle of Relativity made later by Einstein, which introduces the concept of simplicity not mentioned above is:\n{{quote|''Special principle of relativity'': If a system of coordinates K is chosen so that, in relation to it, physical laws hold good in their simplest form, the ''same'' laws hold good in relation to any other system of coordinates K' moving in uniform translation relatively to K.<ref name=Einstein>{{cite book |title=The Principle of Relativity: a collection of original memoirs on the special and general theory of relativity |author=Einstein, A., Lorentz, H.

Einstein later derived these transformations from his axioms.\n\nMany of Einstein's papers present derivations of the Lorentz transformation based upon these two principles.<ref>Einstein, On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It, 1907; \"The Principle of Relativity and Its Consequences in Modern Physics\", 1910; \"The Theory of Relativity\", 1911; Manuscript on the Special Theory of Relativity, 1912; Theory of Relativity, 1913; Einstein, Relativity, the Special and General Theory, 1916; The Principle Ideas of the Theory of Relativity, 1916; What Is The Theory of Relativity?, 1919; The Principle of Relativity (Princeton Lectures), 1921; Physics and Reality, 1936; The Theory of Relativity, 1949.</ref>\n\nEinstein consistently based the derivation of Lorentz invariance (the essential core of special relativity) on just the two basic principles of relativity and light-speed invariance. He wrote:\n{{quote|The insight fundamental for the special theory of relativity is this: The assumptions relativity and light speed invariance are compatible if relations of a new type (\"Lorentz transformation\") are postulated for the conversion of coordinates and times of events...

There is conflicting evidence on the extent to which Einstein was influenced by the null result of the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]].<ref>[[Michael Polanyi]] (1974) ''Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy'', ISBN 0-226-67288-3, footnote page 10\u201311: Einstein reports, via Dr N Balzas in response to Polanyi's query, that \"The Michelson\u2013Morley experiment had no role in the foundation of the theory.\" and \"..the theory of relativity was not founded to explain its outcome at all.\" [https://books.google.com/books?id=0Rtu8kCpvz4C&lpg=PP1&pg=PT19]</ref><ref name=\"mM1905\"/> In any case, the null result of the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment helped the notion of the constancy of the speed of light gain widespread and rapid acceptance.\n\n== Lack of an absolute reference frame ==\nThe [[principle of relativity]], which states that there is no preferred [[inertial reference frame]], dates back to [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], and was incorporated into Newtonian physics. However, in the late 19th century, the existence of [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] led physicists to suggest that the universe was filled with a substance that they called \"[[Luminiferous aether|aether]]\", which would act as the medium through which these waves, or vibrations travelled. The aether was thought to constitute an [[preferred frame|absolute reference frame]] against which speeds could be measured, and could be considered fixed and motionless. Aether supposedly possessed some wonderful properties: it was sufficiently elastic to support electromagnetic waves, and those waves could interact with matter, yet it offered no resistance to bodies passing through it. The results of various experiments, including the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]], led to the theory of special relativity, by showing that there was no aether.<ref>Staley, Richard (2009), \"Albert Michelson, the Velocity of Light, and the Ether Drift\", ''Einstein's generation. The origins of the relativity revolution,'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0-226-77057-5</ref> Einstein's solution was to discard the notion of an aether and the absolute state of rest. In relativity, any reference frame moving with uniform motion will observe the same laws of physics. In particular, the speed of light in vacuum is always measured to be ''c'', even when measured by multiple systems that are moving at different (but constant) velocities.\n\n== Reference frames, coordinates, and the Lorentz transformation ==\n{{Main|Lorentz transformation}}\n[[File:Frames of reference in relative motion.svg|thumb|right|300px|The primed system is in motion relative to the unprimed system with constant velocity v only along the x-axis, from the perspective of an observer stationary in the unprimed system. By the [[principle of relativity]], an observer stationary in the primed system will view a likewise construction except that the velocity they record will be \u2212v. The changing of the speed of propagation of interaction from infinite in non-relativistic mechanics to a finite value will require a modification of the transformation equations mapping events in one frame to another.]]\n\n[[Frame of reference|Reference frames]] play a crucial role in relativity theory. The term reference frame as used here is an observational perspective in space which is not undergoing any change in motion (acceleration), from which a position can be measured along 3 spatial axes. In addition, a reference frame has the ability to determine measurements of the time of events using a 'clock' (any reference device with uniform periodicity).\n\nAn [[Event (relativity)|event]] is an occurrence that can be assigned a single unique time and location in space relative to a reference frame: it is a \"point\" in [[spacetime]]. Since the speed of light is constant in relativity in each and every reference frame, pulses of light can be used to unambiguously measure distances and refer back the times that events occurred to the clock, even though light takes time to reach the clock after the event has transpired.\n\nFor example, the explosion of a [[firecracker]] may be considered to be an \"event\". We can completely specify an event by its four spacetime coordinates: The time of occurrence and its 3-dimensional spatial location define a reference point. Let's call this reference frame ''S''.\n\nIn relativity theory we often want to calculate the position of a point from a different reference point.\n\nSuppose we have a second reference frame ''S''\u2032, whose spatial axes and clock exactly coincide with that of ''S'' at time zero, but it is moving at a constant velocity ''v'' with respect to ''S'' along the ''x''-axis.\n\nSince there is no absolute reference frame in relativity theory, a concept of 'moving' doesn't strictly exist, as everything is always moving with respect to some other reference frame. Instead, any two frames that move at the same speed in the same direction are said to be ''comoving''. Therefore, ''S'' and ''S''\u2032 are not ''comoving''.\n\nDefine the [[Spacetime#Basic concepts|event]] to have spacetime coordinates {{nowrap|(''t'',''x'',''y'',''z'')}} in system ''S'' and {{nowrap|(''t''\u2032,''x''\u2032,''y''\u2032,''z''\u2032)}} in ''S''\u2032. Then the [[Lorentz transformation]] specifies that these coordinates are related in the following way:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nt' &= \\gamma \\ (t - vx/c^2) \\\\\nx' &= \\gamma \\ (x - v t) \\\\\ny' &= y \\\\\nz' &= z ,\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}</math>\nis the [[Lorentz factor]] and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, and the velocity ''v'' of ''S''\u2032 is parallel to the ''x''-axis. The ''y'' and ''z'' coordinates are unaffected; only the ''x'' and ''t'' coordinates are transformed. These Lorentz transformations form a [[one-parameter group]] of [[linear mapping]]s, that parameter being called [[rapidity]].\n\nThere is nothing special about the ''x''-axis, the transformation can apply to the ''y'' or ''z'' axes, or indeed in any direction, which can be done by directions parallel to the motion (which are warped by the \u03b3 factor) and perpendicular; see main article for details.\n\nA quantity invariant under [[Lorentz transformations]] is known as a [[Lorentz scalar]].\n\nWriting the Lorentz transformation and its inverse in terms of coordinate differences, where for instance one event has coordinates {{nowrap|(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''t''<sub>1</sub>)}} and {{nowrap|(''x''\u2032<sub>1</sub>, ''t''\u2032<sub>1</sub>)}}, another event has coordinates {{nowrap|(''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''t''<sub>2</sub>) }}and {{nowrap|(''x''\u2032<sub>2</sub>, ''t''\u2032<sub>2</sub>)}}, and the differences are defined as\n\n:<math> \\begin{array}{ll}\n\\Delta x' = x'_2-x'_1 \\ , & \\Delta x = x_2-x_1 \\ , \\\\\n\\Delta t' = t'_2-t'_1 \\ , & \\Delta t = t_2-t_1 \\ , \\\\\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nwe get\n\n:<math> \\begin{array}{ll}\n\\Delta x' = \\gamma \\ (\\Delta x - v \\,\\Delta t) \\ , & \\Delta x = \\gamma \\ (\\Delta x' + v \\,\\Delta t') \\ , \\\\\n\\Delta t' = \\gamma \\ \\left(\\Delta t - \\dfrac{v \\,\\Delta x}{c^{2}} \\right) \\ , & \\Delta t = \\gamma \\ \\left(\\Delta t' + \\dfrac{v \\,\\Delta x'}{c^{2}} \\right) \\ . \\\\\n\\end{array}</math>\n\nThese effects are not merely appearances; they are explicitly related to our way of measuring ''time intervals'' between events which occur at the same place in a given coordinate system (called \"co-local\" events). These time intervals will be ''different'' in another coordinate system moving with respect to the first, unless the events are also simultaneous. Similarly, these effects also relate to our measured distances between separated but simultaneous events in a given coordinate system of choice. If these events are not co-local, but are separated by distance (space), they will ''not'' occur at the same ''spatial distance'' from each other when seen from another moving coordinate system. However, the [[spacetime interval]] will be the same for all observers.\n\n== Consequences derived from the Lorentz transformation ==\n{{See also|Twin paradox|Relativistic mechanics}}\n\nThe consequences of special relativity can be derived from the [[Lorentz transformation]] equations.<ref>{{cite book |title=Introduction to special relativity |author=Robert Resnick |publisher=Wiley |date=1968|pages=62\u201363 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fsIRAQAAIAAJ}}</ref> These transformations, and hence special relativity, lead to different physical predictions than those of Newtonian mechanics when relative velocities become comparable to the speed of light. The speed of light is so much larger than anything humans encounter that some of the effects\npredicted by relativity are initially [[counterintuitive]].\n\n=== Relativity of simultaneity ===\n{{See also|Relativity of simultaneity|Ladder paradox}}\n[[Image:Relativity of Simultaneity.svg|thumb|Event B is simultaneous with A in the green reference frame, but it occurs before A in the blue frame, and occurs after A in the red frame.]]\nTwo events happening in two different locations that occur simultaneously in the reference frame of one inertial observer, may occur non-simultaneously in the reference frame of another inertial observer (lack of [[absolute simultaneity]]).\n\nFrom the first equation of the Lorentz transformation in terms of coordinate differences\n\n:<math>\\Delta t' = \\gamma \\left(\\Delta t - \\frac{v \\,\\Delta x}{c^{2}} \\right)</math>\n\nit is clear that two events that are simultaneous in frame ''S'' (satisfying {{nowrap|1=\u0394''t'' = 0}}), are not necessarily simultaneous in another inertial frame ''S''\u2032 (satisfying {{nowrap|1=\u0394''t''\u2032 = 0}}). Only if these events are additionally co-local in frame ''S'' (satisfying {{nowrap|1=\u0394''x'' = 0}}), will they be simultaneous in another frame ''S''\u2032.\n\n=== Time dilation ===\n{{See also|Time dilation}}\nThe time lapse between two events is not invariant from one observer to another, but is dependent on the relative speeds of the observers' reference frames (e.g., the [[twin paradox]] which concerns a twin who flies off in a spaceship traveling near the speed of light and returns to discover that his or her twin sibling has aged much more).\n\nSuppose a [[clock]] is at rest in the unprimed system ''S''. The location of the clock on two different ticks is then characterized by {{nowrap|1=\u0394''x'' = 0}}. To find the relation between the times between these ticks as measured in both systems, the first equation can be used to find:\n:<math>\\Delta t' = \\gamma\\, \\Delta t </math>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for events satisfying&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<math>\\Delta x = 0 \\ .</math>\nThis shows that the time (\u0394''t''\u2032) between the two ticks as seen in the frame in which the clock is moving (''S''\u2032), is ''longer'' than the time (\u0394''t'') between these ticks as measured in the rest frame of the clock (''S''). Time dilation explains a number of physical phenomena; for example, the lifetime of [[muon]]s produced by cosmic rays impinging on the Earth's atmosphere is measured to be greater than the lifetimes of muons measured in the laboratory.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Daniel Kleppner  |author2=David Kolenkow |lastauthoramp=yes |title=An Introduction to Mechanics|date=1973|pages=468\u201370|isbn=0-07-035048-5}}</ref>\n\n=== Length contraction ===\n{{See also|Lorentz contraction}}\nThe dimensions (e.g., length) of an object as measured by one observer may be smaller than the results of measurements of the same object made by another observer (e.g., the [[ladder paradox]] involves a long ladder traveling near the speed of light and being contained within a smaller garage).\n\nSimilarly, suppose a [[measuring rod]] is at rest and aligned along the x-axis in the unprimed system ''S''. In this system, the length of this rod is written as \u0394''x''. To measure the length of this rod in the system ''S''\u2032, in which the rod is moving, the distances ''x''\u2032 to the end points of the rod must be measured simultaneously in that system ''S''\u2032. In other words, the measurement is characterized by {{nowrap|1=\u0394''t''\u2032 = 0}}, which can be combined with the fourth equation to find the relation between the lengths \u0394''x'' and \u0394''x''\u2032:\n:<math>\\Delta x' = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\gamma} </math>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for events satisfying&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<math>\\Delta t' = 0 \\ .</math>\nThis shows that the length (\u0394''x''\u2032) of the rod as measured in the frame in which it is moving (''S''\u2032), is ''shorter'' than its length (\u0394''x'') in its own rest frame (''S'').\n\n=== Composition of velocities ===\n{{See also|Velocity-addition formula}}\n\nVelocities (speeds) do not simply add. If the observer in ''S'' measures an object moving along the ''x'' axis at velocity ''u'', then the observer in the ''S''\u2032 system, a frame of reference moving at velocity ''v'' in the ''x'' direction with respect to ''S'', will measure the object moving with velocity ''u''\u2032 where (from the Lorentz transformations above):\n\n:<math>u'=\\frac{dx'}{dt'}=\\frac{\\gamma \\ (dx-v dt)}{\\gamma \\ (dt-v dx/c^2)}=\\frac{(dx/dt)-v}{1-(v/c^2)(dx/dt)}=\\frac{u-v}{1-uv/c^2} \\ . </math>\n\nThe other frame ''S'' will measure:\n\n:<math>u=\\frac{dx}{dt}=\\frac{\\gamma \\ (dx'+v dt')}{\\gamma \\ (dt'+v dx'/c^2)}=\\frac{(dx'/dt')+v}{1+(v/c^2)(dx'/dt')}=\\frac{u'+v}{1+u'v/c^2} \\ .</math>\n\nNotice that if the object were moving at the speed of light in the ''S'' system (i.e. ''u'' = ''c''), then it would also be moving at the speed of light in the ''S''\u2032 system. Also, if both ''u'' and ''v'' are small with respect to the speed of light, we will recover the intuitive Galilean transformation of velocities\n:<math>u' \\approx u-v \\ . </math>\n\nThe usual example given is that of a train (frame ''S''\u2032 above) traveling due east with a velocity ''v'' with respect to the tracks (frame ''S''). A child inside the train throws a baseball due east with a velocity ''u''\u2032 with respect to the train. In nonrelativistic physics, an observer at rest on the tracks will measure the velocity of the baseball (due east) as {{nowrap|1=''u'' = ''u''\u2032 + ''v''}}, while in special relativity this is no longer true; instead the velocity of the baseball (due east) is given by the second equation: {{nowrap|1=''u'' = (''u''\u2032 + ''v'')/(1 + ''u''\u2032''v''/''c''<sup>2</sup>)}}. Again, there is nothing special about the ''x'' or east directions. This formalism applies to any direction by considering parallel and perpendicular components of motion to the direction of relative velocity ''v'', see main article for details.\n\n== Other consequences ==\n\n=== Thomas rotation ===\n{{See also|Thomas rotation}}\nThe orientation of an object (i.e. the alignment of its axes with the observer's axes) may be different for different observers. Unlike other relativistic effects, this effect becomes quite significant at fairly low velocities as can be seen in the [[Spin\u2013orbit interaction|spin of moving particles]].\n\n=== Equivalence of mass and energy ===\n{{Main|Mass\u2013energy equivalence}}\n\nAs an object's speed approaches the speed of light from an observer's point of view, its [[relativistic mass]] increases thereby making it more and more difficult to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference.\n\nThe energy content of an object at rest with mass ''m'' equals ''mc''<sup>2</sup>. Conservation of energy implies that, in any reaction, a decrease of the sum of the masses of particles must be accompanied by an increase in kinetic energies of the particles after the reaction. Similarly, the mass of an object can be increased by taking in kinetic energies.\n\nIn addition to the papers referenced above\u2014which give derivations of the Lorentz transformation and describe the foundations of special relativity\u2014Einstein also wrote at least four papers giving [[heuristic]] arguments for the equivalence (and transmutability) of mass and energy, for {{nowrap|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}.\n\nMass\u2013energy equivalence is a consequence of special relativity. The energy and momentum, which are separate in Newtonian mechanics, form a [[four-vector]] in relativity, and this relates the time component (the energy) to the space components (the momentum) in a non-trivial way. For an object at rest, the energy\u2013momentum four-vector is {{nowrap|(''E/c'', 0, 0, 0)}}: it has a time component which is the energy, and three space components which are zero. By changing frames with a Lorentz transformation in the x direction with a small value of the velocity v, the energy momentum four-vector becomes {{nowrap|(''E/c'', ''Ev''/''c''<sup>2</sup>, 0, 0)}}. The momentum is equal to the energy multiplied by the velocity divided by ''c''<sup>2</sup>. As such, the Newtonian mass of an object, which is the ratio of the momentum to the velocity for slow velocities, is equal to ''E''/''c''<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThe energy and momentum are properties of matter and radiation, and it is impossible to deduce that they form a four-vector just from the two basic postulates of special relativity by themselves, because these don't talk about matter or radiation, they only talk about space and time. The derivation therefore requires some additional physical reasoning. In his 1905 paper, Einstein used the additional principles that Newtonian mechanics should hold for slow velocities, so that there is one energy scalar and one three-vector momentum at slow velocities, and that the conservation law for energy and momentum is exactly true in relativity. Furthermore, he assumed that the energy of light is transformed by the same Doppler-shift factor as its frequency, which he had previously shown to be true based on Maxwell's equations.<ref name=electro /> The first of Einstein's papers on this subject was \"Does the Inertia of a Body Depend upon its Energy Content?\" in 1905.<ref name=inertia>[http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/E_mc2/www/ Does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy content?] A.

One would easily think that a traveller would never be able to reach more than the very few solar systems which exist within the limit of 20\u201340 light years from the earth. But that would be a mistaken conclusion. Because of time dilation, a hypothetical spaceship can travel thousands of light years during the pilot's 40 active years. If a spaceship could be built that accelerates at a constant [[Gravity of Earth|1 ''g'']], it will, after a little less than a year, be travelling at almost the speed of light as seen from Earth.  This is described by:\n\n<math>v(t) = \\frac{at}{\\sqrt{1+\\frac{a^2t^2}{c^2}}}</math>\n\nwhere v(t) is the velocity at a time, t, a is the acceleration of 1g and t is the time as measured by people on Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.normalesup.org/~baglio/physique/acceleration.pdf|title = Acceleration in special relativity: What is the meaning of \"uniformly accelerated movement\" ?|date = 26 May 2007|accessdate = 22 January 2016|publisher = Physics Department, ENS Cachan|last = Baglio|first = Julien}}</ref>  Therefore, after 1 year of accelerating at 9.81&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>, the spaceship will be travelling at v = 0.77c relative to Earth.

During his journey, people on Earth will experience more time than he does.  A 5-year round trip for him will take 6\u00bd Earth years and cover a distance of over 6 light-years.

Light cone]]In diagram 2 the interval AB is 'time-like'; i.e., there is a frame of reference in which events A and B occur at the same location in space, separated only by occurring at different times. If A precedes B in that frame, then A precedes B in all frames. It is hypothetically possible for matter (or information) to travel from A to B, so there can be a causal relationship (with A the cause and B the effect).\n\nThe interval AC in the diagram is 'space-like'; i.e., there is a frame of reference in which events A and C occur simultaneously, separated only in space. There are also frames in which A precedes C (as shown) and frames in which C precedes A. If it were possible for a cause-and-effect relationship to exist between events A and C, then paradoxes of causality would result. For example, if A was the cause, and C the effect, then there would be frames of reference in which the effect preceded the cause.

A causal paradox can then be constructed by sending the signal if and only if no signal was received previously.\n\nTherefore, if [[causality]] is to be preserved, one of the consequences of special relativity is that no information signal or material object can travel [[faster than light]] in vacuum. However, some \"things\" can still move faster than light. For example, the location where the beam of a search light hits the bottom of a cloud can move faster than light when the search light is turned rapidly.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Four Decades of Scientific Explanation\n|author=Wesley C.

For example, if a constant force is applied to an object for a limitless amount of time, then integrating {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''dp''/''dt''}} gives a momentum that grows without bound, but this is simply because <math>p = m \\gamma v</math> approaches [[infinity]] as <math>v</math> approaches ''c''. To an observer who is not accelerating, it appears as though the object's inertia is increasing, so as to produce a smaller acceleration in response to the same force.

All equations and effects of special relativity can be derived from this rotational symmetry (the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]]) of Minkowski spacetime.\n\nThe actual form of ''ds'' above depends on the metric and on the choices for the ''X''<sup>0</sup> coordinate.\nTo make the time coordinate look like the space coordinates, it can be treated as [[imaginary number|imaginary]]: {{nowrap|1=''X''<sub>0</sub> = ''ict''}} (this is called a [[Wick rotation]]).\nAccording to [[Gravitation (book)|Misner, Thorne and Wheeler]] (1971, \u00a72.3), ultimately the deeper understanding of both special and general relativity will come from the study of the Minkowski metric (described below) and to take {{nowrap|1=''X''<sup>0</sup> = ''ct''}}, rather than a \"disguised\" Euclidean metric using ''ict'' as the time coordinate.\n\nSome authors use {{nowrap|1=''X''<sup>0</sup> = ''t''}}, with factors of ''c'' elsewhere to compensate; for instance, spatial coordinates are divided by ''c'' or factors of ''c''<sup>\u00b12</sup> are included in the metric tensor.<ref>{{cite book |author=R.

That is, when we look at the [[star]]s and say \"The light from that star which I am receiving is X years old\", we are looking down this line of sight: a null geodesic. We are looking at an event a distance <math>d = \\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2} </math> away and a time ''d/c'' in the past. For this reason the null dual cone is also known as the 'light cone'. (The point in the lower left of the picture above right represents the star, the origin represents the observer, and the line represents the null geodesic \"line of sight\".)\n\nThe cone in the \u2212''t'' region is the information that the point is 'receiving', while the cone in the +''t'' section is the information that the point is 'sending'.\n\nThe geometry of Minkowski space can be depicted using [[Minkowski diagram]]s, which are useful also in understanding many of the [[Thought experiment|thought-experiments]] in special relativity.\n\nNote that, in 4d spacetime, the concept of the [[center of mass]] becomes more complicated, see [[center of mass (relativistic)]].\n\n== Physics in spacetime ==\n\n===Transformations of physical quantities between reference frames===\n\nAbove, the Lorentz transformation for the time coordinate and three space coordinates illustrates that they are intertwined. This is true more generally: certain pairs of \"timelike\" and \"spacelike\" quantities naturally combine on equal footing under the same Lorentz transformation.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation in standard configuration above, i.e. for a boost in the ''x'' direction, can be recast into matrix form as follows:\n\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}\nct'\\\\ x'\\\\ y'\\\\ z'\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\gamma & -\\beta\\gamma & 0 & 0\\\\\n-\\beta\\gamma & \\gamma & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nct\\\\ x\\\\ y\\\\ z\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\gamma ct- \\gamma\\beta x\\\\\n\\gamma x - \\beta \\gamma ct \\\\ y\\\\ z\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\n \nIn Newtonian mechanics, quantities which have magnitude and direction are mathematically described as 3d vectors in Euclidean space, and in general they are parametrized by time. In special relativity, this notion is extended by adding the appropriate timelike quantity to a spacelike vector quantity, and we have 4d vectors, or \"[[four vector]]s\", in Minkowski spacetime. The components of vectors are written using [[tensor index notation]], as this has numerous advantages. The notation makes it clear the equations are [[manifestly covariant]] under the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]], thus bypassing the tedious calculations to check this fact. In constructing such equations, we often find that equations previously thought to be unrelated are, in fact, closely connected being part of the same tensor equation. Recognizing other physical quantities as tensors simplifies their transformation laws. Throughout, upper indices (superscripts) are contravariant indices rather than exponents except when they indicate a square (this is should be clear from the context), and lower indices (subscripts) are covariant indices. For simplicity and consistency with the earlier equations, Cartesian coordinates will be used.\n\nThe simplest example of a four-vector is the position of an event in spacetime, which constitutes a timelike component ''ct'' and spacelike component {{nowrap|1='''x''' = (''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}, in a [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] [[position vector|position]] [[four vector]] with components:\n\n:<math>X^\\nu = (X^0, X^1, X^2, X^3)= (ct, x, y, z) = (ct, \\mathbf{x} ).</math>\n\nwhere we define {{nowrap|1=''X''<sup>0</sup> = ''ct''}} so that the time coordinate has the same dimension of distance as the other spatial dimensions; so that space and time are treated equally.<ref>Jean-Bernard Zuber & Claude Itzykson, ''Quantum Field Theory'', pg 5, ISBN 0-07-032071-3</ref><ref>[[Charles W.

Invariants can be constructed using the metric, the inner product of a 4-vector ''T'' with another 4-vector ''S'' is:\n\n:<math>T^{\\alpha}S_{\\alpha}=T^{\\alpha}\\eta_{\\alpha\\beta}S^{\\beta} = T_{\\alpha}\\eta^{\\alpha\\beta}S_{\\beta} = \\text{invariant scalar}</math>\n\nInvariant means that it takes the same value in all inertial frames, because it is a scalar (0 rank tensor), and so no \u039b appears in its trivial transformation. The magnitude of the 4-vector ''T'' is the positive square root of the inner product with itself:\n\n:<math>|\\mathbf{T}| = \\sqrt{T^{\\alpha}T_{\\alpha}}</math>\n\nOne can extend this idea to tensors of higher order, for a second order tensor we can form the invariants:\n\n:<math>T^{\\alpha}{}_{\\alpha}\\,,T^{\\alpha}{}_{\\beta}T^{\\beta}{}_{\\alpha}\\,,T^{\\alpha}{}_{\\beta}T^{\\beta}{}_{\\gamma}T^{\\gamma}{}_{\\alpha} = \\text{invariant scalars}\\,,</math>\n\nsimilarly for higher order tensors. Invariant expressions, particularly inner products of 4-vectors with themselves, provide equations that are useful for calculations, because one doesn't need to perform Lorentz transformations to determine the invariants.\n\n===Relativistic kinematics and invariance===\n\nThe coordinate differentials transform also contravariantly:\n\n:<math>dX^{\\mu'}=\\Lambda^{\\mu'}{}_\\nu dX^\\nu</math>\n\nso the squared length of the differential of the position four-vector ''dX<sup>\u03bc</sup>'' constructed using\n\n:<math>d\\mathbf{X}^2 = dX^\\mu \\,dX_\\mu = \\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\,dX^\\mu \\,dX^\\nu = -(c dt)^2+(dx)^2+(dy)^2+(dz)^2\\,</math>\n\nis an invariant. Notice that when the [[line element]] ''d'''''X'''<sup>2</sup> is negative that {{sqrt|\u2212''d'''''X'''<sup>2</sup>}} is the differential of [[proper time]], while when ''d'''''X'''<sup>2</sup> is positive, {{sqrt|''d'''''X'''<sup>2</sup>}} is differential of the [[proper distance]].\n\nThe 4-velocity ''U''<sup>\u03bc</sup> has an invariant form:\n\n:<math>{\\mathbf U}^2 = \\eta_{\\nu\\mu} U^\\nu U^\\mu = -c^2 \\,,</math>\n\nwhich means all velocity four-vectors have a magnitude of ''c''. This is an expression of the fact that there is no such thing as being at coordinate rest in relativity: at the least, you are always moving forward through time. Differentiating the above equation by ''\u03c4'' produces:\n\n:<math>2\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}A^\\mu U^\\nu = 0.</math>\n\nSo in special relativity, the acceleration four-vector and the velocity four-vector are orthogonal.\n\n===Relativistic dynamics and invariance===\n\nThe invariant magnitude of the [[four-momentum|momentum 4-vector]] generates the [[energy\u2013momentum relation]]:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{P}^2 = \\eta^{\\mu\\nu}P_\\mu P_\\nu = -(E/c)^2 + p^2 .</math>\n\nWe can work out what this invariant is by first arguing that, since it is a scalar, it doesn't matter in which reference frame we calculate it, and then by transforming to a frame where the total momentum is zero.\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{P}^2 = - (E_\\mathrm{rest}/c)^2 = - (m c)^2 .</math>\n\nWe see that the rest energy is an independent invariant. A rest energy can be calculated even for particles and systems in motion, by translating to a frame in which momentum is zero.\n\nThe rest energy is related to the mass according to the celebrated equation discussed above:\n\n:<math>E_\\mathrm{rest} = m c^2.</math>\n\nNote that the mass of systems measured in their center of momentum frame (where total momentum is zero) is given by the total energy of the system in this frame. It may not be equal to the sum of individual system masses measured in other frames.\n\nTo use [[Newton's third law of motion]], both forces must be defined as the rate of change of momentum with respect to the same time coordinate. That is, it requires the 3D force defined above. Unfortunately, there is no tensor in 4D which contains the components of the 3D force vector among its components.\n\nIf a particle is not traveling at ''c'', one can transform the 3D force from the particle's co-moving reference frame into the observer's reference frame. This yields a 4-vector called the [[four-force]]. It is the rate of change of the above energy momentum [[four-vector]] with respect to proper time. The covariant version of the four-force is:\n\n:<math>F_\\nu = \\frac{d P_{\\nu}}{d \\tau} = m A_\\nu </math>\n\nIn the rest frame of the object, the time component of the four force is zero unless the \"[[invariant mass]]\" of the object is changing (this requires a non-closed system in which energy/mass is being directly added or removed from the object) in which case it is the negative of that rate of change of mass, times ''c''. In general, though, the components of the four force are not equal to the components of the three-force, because the three force is defined by the rate of change of momentum with respect to coordinate time, i.e. ''dp''/''dt'' while the four force is defined by the rate of change of momentum with respect to proper time, i.e. ''dp''/''d''\u03c4.\n\nIn a continuous medium, the 3D ''density of force'' combines with the ''density of power'' to form a covariant 4-vector. The spatial part is the result of dividing the force on a small cell (in 3-space) by the volume of that cell. The time component is \u22121/''c'' times the power transferred to that cell divided by the volume of the cell. This will be used below in the section on electromagnetism.\n\n== Relativity and unifying electromagnetism ==\n{{Main|Classical electromagnetism and special relativity|Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism}}\nTheoretical investigation in [[classical electromagnetism]] led to the discovery of wave propagation. Equations generalizing the electromagnetic effects found that finite propagation speed of the '''E''' and '''B''' fields required certain behaviors on charged particles. The general study of moving charges forms the [[Li\u00e9nard\u2013Wiechert potential]], which is a step towards special relativity.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation of the [[electric field]] of a moving charge into a non-moving observer's reference frame results in the appearance of a mathematical term commonly called the [[magnetic field]]. Conversely, the ''magnetic'' field generated by a moving charge disappears and becomes a purely ''electrostatic'' field in a comoving frame of reference. [[Maxwell's equations]] are thus simply an empirical fit to special relativistic effects in a classical model of the Universe. As electric and magnetic fields are reference frame dependent and thus intertwined, one speaks of ''electromagnetic'' fields. Special relativity provides the transformation rules for how an electromagnetic field in one inertial frame appears in another inertial frame.\n\n[[Maxwell's equations]] in the 3D form are already consistent with the physical content of special relativity, although they are easier to manipulate in a [[manifestly covariant]] form, i.e. in the language of [[tensor]] calculus.<ref>{{cite book|title=Formal Structure of Electromagnetics: General Covariance and Electromagnetics|date=1962|publisher=Dover Publications Inc.|isbn=0-486-65427-3|author=E.

See [[classical mechanics]] for a more detailed discussion.\n\nSeveral experiments predating Einstein's 1905 paper are now interpreted as evidence for relativity. Of these it is known Einstein was aware of the Fizeau experiment before 1905,<ref>{{cite journal|author=John D.

It should be stated here that, contrary to many alternative claims, it said little about the invariance of the speed of light with respect to the source and observer's velocity, as both source and observer were travelling together at the same velocity at all times.\n* The [[Trouton\u2013Noble experiment]] (1903) showed that the torque on a capacitor is independent of position and inertial reference frame.\n* The [[Experiments of Rayleigh and Brace]] (1902, 1904) showed that length contraction doesn't lead to birefringence for a co-moving observer, in accordance with the relativity principle.\n\n[[Particle accelerator]]s routinely accelerate and measure the properties of particles moving at near the speed of light, where their behavior is completely consistent with relativity theory and inconsistent with the earlier [[Newtonian mechanics]]. These machines would simply not work if they were not engineered according to relativistic principles. In addition, a considerable number of modern experiments have been conducted to test special relativity. Some examples:\n* [[Tests of relativistic energy and momentum]] \u2013 testing the limiting speed of particles\n* [[Ives\u2013Stilwell experiment]] \u2013 testing relativistic Doppler effect and time dilation\n* [[Time dilation of moving particles]] \u2013 relativistic effects on a fast-moving particle's half-life\n* [[Kennedy\u2013Thorndike experiment]] \u2013 time dilation in accordance with Lorentz transformations\n* [[Hughes\u2013Drever experiment]] \u2013 testing isotropy of space and mass\n* [[Modern searches for Lorentz violation]] \u2013 various modern tests\n* Experiments to test [[emission theory]] demonstrated that the speed of light is independent of the speed of the emitter.\n* Experiments to test the [[aether drag hypothesis]] \u2013 no \"aether flow obstruction\".\n\n==Theories of relativity and quantum mechanics==\n''Special'' relativity can be combined with [[quantum mechanics]] to form [[relativistic quantum mechanics]].
