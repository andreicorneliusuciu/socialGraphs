The Kestrel engine was developed in the 2000s by [[SpaceX]] for upper stage use on the [[Falcon 1]] rocket.\n\nKestrel was built around the same [[pintle injector|pintle]] architecture as the SpaceX [[Merlin (rocket engine)|Merlin engine]] but does not have a [[turbo-pump]] and is fed only by tank pressure.\n\nKestrel is [[Ablation|ablatively]] cooled in the chamber and throat and [[radiative cooling|radiatively cooled]] in the nozzle, which is fabricated from a high strength [[niobium]] alloy. As a metal, niobium is highly resistant to cracking compared to [[Reinforced carbon\u2013carbon|carbon-carbon]]. According to SpaceX, an impact from orbital debris or during stage separation might dent the metal but have no meaningful effect on engine performance.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/SpaceX_Confirms_Stage_Bump_On_Demoflight_2_999.html | title=SpaceX Confirms Stage Bump On Demoflight 2 | author = Greg Zsidisin | date = 23 March 2007 | publisher = Space Daily |accessdate=2008-09-30}}</ref> [[Helium]] pressurant efficiency is substantially increased via a titanium heat exchanger on the ablative/niobium boundary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spacex.com/SpaceX_F1-003_PressKit.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=SpaceX |title=Falcon 1 Flight Three Press Kit |accessdate=2008-09-30}}</ref>\n\nThrust vector control is provided by electro-mechanical actuators on the engine dome for pitch and yaw. Roll control (and attitude control during [[coast phase]]s) is provided by helium [[cold gas thruster]]s.\n\nA [[Triethylaluminium|TEA]]-[[Triethylborane|TEB]] pyrophoric [[rocket ignition|ignition]] system is used to provide multiple restart capability on the upper stage.  In a multi-manifested mission, this design would allow for drop off at different altitudes and inclinations.\n\n== Kestrel 2 ==\nEnhancements to the design of the original Kestrel engine were planned, called the '''Kestrel 2'''.<ref name=ssc200708>\n{{cite journal |last=Bjelde|first=Brian |author2=Max Vozoff |author3=Gwynne Shotwell  |title=The Falcon 1 Launch Vehicle: Demonstration Flights, Status, Manifest, and Upgrade Path |journal=21st Annual AIAA/USU Conference on Small Satellites |date=August 2007 |issue=SSC07 \u2010 III \u2010 6 |url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1456&context=smallsat |accessdate=2013-12-06 }}</ref> \n\nThe engine was planned to continue to be [[Pressure-fed engine (rocket)|pressure-fed]] design, but was to have flown on a newly designed second stage that was to use [[Aluminium-lithium alloy]] [[2195 aluminum alloy|2195]] rather than the [[2014 aluminum alloy|2014 Aluminum]] used in the Falcon 1 second stage.<ref name=ssc200708/>\nEngine changes were to include tighter tolerances to improve consistency, higher [[Specific impulse|I<sub>sp</sub>]], and lighter weight.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Bergin\n  | first = Chris\n  | authorlink = \n  |author2=Braddock Gaskill\n   | title = Elon Musk Q and A - Updates SpaceX status on Falcon and Dragon\n  | work = \n  | publisher = NASAspaceflight.com\n  | date = 2007-09-24\n  | url = http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=5237\n  | format = \n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = 2008-06-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080529015150/http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=5237 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-29}}</ref>{{update after|2011|11|16}}\nThe Kestrel 2 did not remain in active development after the Falcon 1 was replaced by the much larger [[Falcon 9 v1.0]] which used an improved [[Merlin 1C]] for its upperstage.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Draco (rocket engine)]]\n* [[Merlin (rocket engine)]]\n* [[Raptor (rocket engine)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Kestrel (rocket engine)}}\n* [http://www.spacex.com/falcon1.php#kestrel_engine SpaceX Falcon engines page]\n\n{{Rocket engines}}\n{{SpaceX}}\n\n__NOTOC__\n[[Category:SpaceX rocket engines]]\n[[Category:Rocket engines using kerosene propellant]]\n[[Category:Rocket engines using the pressure-fed cycle]]\n[[Category:Rocket engines of the United States]]"}]}}}}
