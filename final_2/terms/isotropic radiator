Note how the rings are even and of the same width all the way around each circle, though they fade as they move away from the source.]]\nAn '''isotropic radiator''' is a theoretical [[point source]] of [[electromagnetic wave|electromagnetic]] or [[sound wave]]s which radiates the same intensity of radiation in all directions.  It has no preferred direction of radiation.  It radiates uniformly in all directions over a sphere centred on the source.  Isotropic radiators are used as reference radiators with which other sources are compared, for example in determining the [[antenna gain|gain]] of [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]s.   A [[coherent radiation|coherent]] isotropic radiator of electromagnetic waves is theoretically impossible, but incoherent radiators can be built.   An isotropic sound radiator is possible because sound is a [[longitudinal wave]].\n\nWhether a radiator is isotropic is independent of whether it obeys [[Lambert's law]]. As radiators, a spherical black body is both, a flat black body is Lambertian but not isotropic, a flat chrome sheet is neither, and by symmetry the Sun is isotropic, but not Lambertian on account of [[limb darkening]].\n\n== Physics ==\nIn physics, an isotropic radiator is a point radiation or sound source.  At a distance, the sun is an isotropic radiator of electromagnetic radiation.  The [[Big Bang]] is another example of an isotropic radiator - the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]].<ref>[http://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/scott/cmb_intro.html Cosmic Microwave Background - Introduction<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Antenna theory===\nIn antenna theory, an '''isotropic antenna''' is a hypothetical antenna radiating the same intensity of [[radio wave]]s in all directions.   It thus is said to have a [[directivity]] of [[Decibel#Antenna measurements|0 dBi (dB relative to isotropic)]] in all directions.\n\nIn reality, a ''[[Coherence (physics)|coherent]]'' isotropic radiator of linear [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] can be shown to be impossible. Its radiation field could not be consistent with the [[Helmholtz equation|Helmholtz wave equation]] (derived from [[Maxwell's equations]]) in all directions simultaneously. Consider a large sphere surrounding the hypothetical point source, so that at that radius the wave over a reasonable area is essentially planar. The electric (and magnetic) field of a plane wave in free space is always perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. So the electric field would have to be tangent to the surface of the sphere everywhere, and continuous along that surface. However the [[hairy ball theorem]] shows that a [[continuous function|continuous]] [[vector field]] [[tangent]] to the surface of a sphere must fall to zero at one or more points on the sphere, which is inconsistent with the assumption of an isotropic radiator with linear polarization.\n\n''[[Coherence (physics)|Incoherent]]'' isotropic radiators are possible and do not violate Maxwell's equations.  Acoustic isotropic radiators are possible because sound waves in a gas or liquid are [[longitudinal waves]] and not [[transverse waves]].\n\nEven though an isotropic antenna cannot exist in practice, it is used as a base of comparison to calculate the directivity of actual antennas.  [[Antenna gain]] <math>\\scriptstyle G</math>, which is equal to the  antenna's [[directivity]] multiplied by the [[antenna efficiency]], is defined as the ratio of the [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] <math>\\scriptstyle I</math> (power per unit area) of the radio power received at a given distance from the antenna (in the direction of maximum radiation) to the intensity <math>\\scriptstyle I_\\text{iso}</math> received from an isotropic antenna at the same distance.  This is called ''isotropic gain'':\n\n:<math>G = {I \\over I_\\text{iso}}\\,</math>\n\nThus the gain of any perfectly efficient antenna averaged over all directions is unity.\n\n====Isotropic receiver====\nIn [[EMF measurements]] applications, an isotropic receiver (also called isotropic antenna) is a field measurement instrument which allows to obtain the total field independently of the tri-axial orthogonal arrangement chosen for orientation of the device itself.\n\nIn practice a quasi-ideal isotropic receiver is obtained with three orthogonal sensing devices with a radiation diagram of the omnidirectional type <math> \\sin (\\theta)</math>, like that of [[Hertzian dipole|short dipole]] and small loop antennas.\n\nThe parameter used to define accuracy in the measurements is called [[EMF measurements#isotropic deviation|isotropic deviation]].\n\n====Derivation of Isotropic Antenna Aperture====\nImagine two cavities in [[thermal equilibrium]]. A lossless [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] in one cavity is connected to a [[Impedance matching|matched resistor]] inside the second cavity. Using the [[Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law|Rayleigh-Jeans]] approximation\n\n:<math>B_{\\nu} = \\frac{2 k T}{\\lambda^2},</math>\n\nthe power received by the antenna over a narrow frequency band is\n\n:<math>P_{\\nu}=A_{e}S_{\\mathrm{matched}}=A_{e}\\frac{S}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\int_{4\\pi}A_{e}B_{\\nu}d\\Omega\\right)d\\nu.</math>\n\nSince the cavities are in thermal equilibrium, this equals the [[Johnson\u2013Nyquist noise|Nyquist spectral power]] of the resistor\n\n:<math>P_{\\nu}=k T d\\nu</math>\n\nin that same frequency band, thus\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\int_{4\\pi}A_{e}B_{\\nu}d\\Omega\\right)d\\nu=k T d\\nu.</math>\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\int_{4\\pi}A_{e}\\frac{2 k T}{\\lambda^2} d\\Omega\\right)d\\nu=k T d\\nu.</math>\n\nBeing [[Isotropy|isotropic]], ''A<sub>e</sub>'' is constant in every direction, thus\n\n:<math>A_{e}\\frac{k T}{\\lambda^2} \\int_{4\\pi} d\\Omega = k T.</math>\n\n:<math>A_{e} = \\frac{\\lambda^2}{4\\pi}.</math><ref>Antenna Fundamentals. http://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/AntennaTheory.html.
