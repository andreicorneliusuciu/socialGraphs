It is important to note that although the particles are unbound, they are not \u2018free\u2019 in the sense of not experiencing forces. When a charged particle moves, it generates an electric current with magnetic fields; in plasma, the movement of a charged particle affects and is affected by the general field created by the movement of other charges. This governs collective behavior with many degrees of variation.<ref name=\"Sturrock\">{{cite book |title=Plasma Physics: An Introduction to the Theory of Astrophysical, Geophysical & Laboratory Plasmas |last=Sturrock |first=Peter A. |date=1994 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-44810-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Framework of Plasma Physics |author=Hazeltine, R.D. |author2=Waelbroeck, F.L. |date=2004 |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=978-0-7382-0047-7}}\n</ref> Three factors are listed in the definition of a plasma stream:<ref name=\"Hazeltine\">{{cite book|author=Dendy, R.

The plasma approximation is valid when the number of charge carriers within the sphere of influence (called the ''Debye sphere'' whose radius is the [[Debye length|Debye screening length]]) of a particular particle is higher than unity to provide collective behavior of the charged particles. The average number of particles in the Debye sphere is given by the [[plasma parameter]],{{ambiguous|used below differently|date=November 2014}} \"\u039b\" (the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] uppercase letter [[Lambda]]).\n#'''Bulk interactions''': The Debye screening length (defined above) is short compared to the physical size of the plasma. This criterion means that interactions in the bulk of the plasma are more important than those at its edges, where boundary effects may take place. When this criterion is satisfied, the plasma is quasineutral.\n#'''Plasma frequency''': The electron plasma frequency (measuring [[plasma oscillation]]s of the electrons) is large compared to the electron-neutral collision frequency (measuring frequency of collisions between electrons and neutral particles). When this condition is valid, electrostatic interactions dominate over the processes of ordinary gas kinetics.\n\n===Ranges of parameters===\nThe factors of a plasma stream can vary by many [[orders of magnitude]], but the properties of plasmas with apparently disparate parameters may be very similar (see [[plasma scaling]]).

The term \"plasma density\" by itself usually refers to the \"electron density\", that is, the number of free electrons per unit volume. The [[degree of ionization]] of a plasma is the proportion of atoms that have lost or gained electrons, and is controlled mostly by the temperature. Even a partially ionized gas in which as little as 1% of the particles are ionized can have the characteristics of a plasma (i.e., response to magnetic fields and high [[electrical conductivity]]). The degree of ionization, <math>\\alpha</math>, is defined as <math>\\alpha = \\frac{n_i}{n_i + n_n}</math>, where <math>n_i</math> is the number density of ions and <math>n_n</math> is the number density of neutral atoms. The ''electron density'' is related to this by the average charge state <math>\\langle Z\\rangle</math> of the ions through <math>n_e = \\langle Z\\rangle n_i</math>, where <math>n_e</math> is the number density of electrons.\n\n===Temperatures===\n{{see also|Nonthermal plasma|Anisothermal plasma}}\nPlasma temperature is commonly measured in [[kelvins]] or [[electronvolt]]s and is, informally, a measure of the thermal kinetic energy per particle. High temperatures are usually needed to sustain ionization, which is a defining feature of a plasma. The degree of plasma ionization is determined by the [[electron temperature]] relative to the [[ionization energy]] (and more weakly by the density), in a relationship called the [[Saha equation]]. At low temperatures, ions and electrons tend to recombine into bound states\u2014atoms<ref name=\"Nicholson\">{{cite book |title=Introduction to Plasma Theory |last=Nicholson |first= Dwight R. |date=1983 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-471-09045-8}}</ref>\u2014and the plasma will eventually become a gas.\n\nIn most cases the electrons are close enough to [[thermal equilibrium]] that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even when there is a significant deviation from a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]] energy [[distribution function]], for example, due to [[UV radiation]], energetic particles, or strong [[electric fields]]. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionized technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the [[ambient temperature]].\n\n====Thermal vs. nonthermal plasmas====\nBased on the relative temperatures of the electrons, ions and neutrals, plasmas are classified as \"thermal\" or \"non-thermal\". Thermal plasmas have electrons and the heavy particles at the same temperature, i.e. they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. Nonthermal plasmas on the other hand have the ions and neutrals at a much lower temperature (sometimes room temperature), whereas electrons are much \"hotter\" (<math>T_e \\gg T_n</math>).<ref>von Engel, A. and Cozens, J.R. (1976) \"Flame Plasma\" in ''Advances in electronics and electron physics'', L. L. Marton (ed.), Academic Press, ISBN 978-0-12-014520-1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0Mndi2cCMuUC&lpg=PA99 p. 99]</ref>\n\n====Complete vs. incomplete ionization====\nA plasma is sometimes referred to as being \"hot\" if it is nearly fully ionized, or \"cold\" if only a small fraction (for example 1%) of the gas molecules are ionized, but other definitions of the terms \"hot plasma\" and \"cold plasma\" are common. Even in a \"cold\" plasma, the electron temperature is still typically several thousand degrees Celsius. Plasmas utilized in \"plasma technology\" (\"technological plasmas\") are usually cold plasmas in the sense that only a small fraction of the gas molecules are ionized.\n\n===Plasma potential===\n[[File:Bliksem in Assen.jpg|thumb|[[Lightning]] is an example of plasma present at Earth's surface.\nTypically, lightning discharges 30,000 amperes at up to 100 million volts, and emits light, radio waves, X-rays and even gamma rays.<ref>See [http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/rhessi_tgf.html Flashes in the Sky: Earth's Gamma-Ray Bursts Triggered by Lightning]</ref> Plasma temperatures in lightning can approach {{convert|28000|K|C F|sigfig=2}} and electron densities may exceed 10<sup>24</sup> m<sup>\u22123</sup>.]]\n\nSince plasmas are very good [[electrical conductor]]s, electric potentials play an important role.\nThe potential as it exists on average in the space between charged particles, independent of the question of how it can be measured, is called the \"plasma potential\", or the \"space potential\". If an electrode is inserted into a plasma, its potential will generally lie considerably below the plasma potential due to what is termed a [[Debye sheath]]. The good electrical conductivity of plasmas makes their electric fields very small. This results in the important concept of \"quasineutrality\", which says the density of negative charges is approximately equal to the density of positive charges over large volumes of the plasma (<math>n_e = \\langle Z\\rangle n_i</math>), but on the scale of the [[Debye length]] there can be charge imbalance. In the special case that ''[[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]]'' are formed, the charge separation can extend some tens of Debye lengths.\n\nThe magnitude of the potentials and electric fields must be determined by means other than simply finding the net [[charge density]]. A common example is to assume that the electrons satisfy the [[Boltzmann relation]]:\n:<math>n_e \\propto e^{e\\Phi/k_BT_e}.</math>\n\nDifferentiating this relation provides a means to calculate the electric field from the density:\n:<math>\\vec{E} = (k_BT_e/e)(\\nabla n_e/n_e).</math>\n\nIt is possible to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral. An electron beam, for example, has only negative charges. The density of a non-neutral plasma must generally be very low, or it must be very small, otherwise it will be dissipated by the repulsive [[electrostatic force]].\n\nIn [[astrophysical]] plasmas, [[electric field screening|Debye screening]] prevents [[electric field]]s from directly affecting the plasma over large distances, i.e., greater than the [[Debye length]]. However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate, and be affected by, [[magnetic field]]s. This can and does cause extremely complex behavior, such as the generation of plasma double layers, an object that separates charge over a few tens of [[Debye length]]s. The dynamics of plasmas interacting with external and self-generated [[magnetic field]]s are studied in the [[academic discipline]] of [[magnetohydrodynamics]].\n\n===Magnetization===\nPlasma with a magnetic field strong enough to influence the motion of the charged particles is said to be magnetized. A common quantitative criterion is that a particle on average completes at least one gyration around the magnetic field before making a collision, i.e., <math>\\omega_{\\mathrm{ce}} / v_{\\mathrm{coll}} > 1</math>, where <math>\\omega_{\\mathrm{ce}}</math> is the \"electron gyrofrequency\" and <math>v_{\\mathrm{coll}}</math> is the \"electron collision rate\". It is often the case that the electrons are magnetized while the ions are not. Magnetized plasmas are ''[[anisotropic]]'', meaning that their properties in the direction parallel to the magnetic field are different from those perpendicular to it. While electric fields in plasmas are usually small due to the high conductivity, the electric field associated with a plasma moving in a magnetic field is given by <math>\\mathbf{E} = -v\\times\\mathbf{B}</math> (where <math>\\mathbf{E}</math> is the electric field, <math>\\mathbf{v}</math> is the velocity, and <math>\\mathbf{B}</math> is the magnetic field), and is not affected by [[Debye shielding]].<ref>Richard Fitzpatrick, ''Introduction to Plasma Physics'', [http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/lectures/node10.html Magnetized plasmas]</ref>\n\n===Comparison of plasma and gas phases===\nPlasma is often called the ''fourth state of matter'' after solid, liquids and gases, despite plasma typically being an ionized gas.<ref>Yaffa Eliezer, Shalom Eliezer, ''The Fourth State of Matter: An Introduction to the Physics of Plasma'', Publisher: Adam Hilger, 1989, ISBN 978-0-85274-164-1, 226 pages, page 5</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Bittencourt, J.A.|title=Fundamentals of Plasma Physics|publisher=Springer|date=2004|isbn=9780387209753|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qCA64ys-5bUC&pg=PA1}}</ref> It is distinct from these and other lower-energy [[states of matter]].

At high powers, the nonlinear part of the index of refraction becomes important and causes a higher index of refraction in the center of the laser beam, where the laser is brighter than at the edges, causing a feedback that focuses the laser even more. The tighter focused laser has a higher peak brightness (irradiance) that forms a plasma. The plasma has an index of refraction lower than one, and causes a defocusing of the laser beam. The interplay of the focusing index of refraction, and the defocusing plasma makes the formation of a long filament of plasma that can be [[micrometer (unit)|micrometers]] to kilometers in length.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Chin, S.

Double layers involve localized charge separation, which causes a large potential difference across the layer, but does not generate an electric field outside the layer. Double layers separate adjacent plasma regions with different physical characteristics, and are often found in current carrying plasmas. They accelerate both ions and electrons.\n\n===Electric fields and circuits===\nQuasineutrality of a plasma requires that plasma currents close on themselves in electric circuits. Such circuits follow [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] and possess a [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] and [[inductance]]. These circuits must generally be treated as a strongly coupled system, with the behavior in each plasma region dependent on the entire circuit. It is this strong coupling between system elements, together with nonlinearity, which may lead to complex behavior. Electrical circuits in plasmas store inductive (magnetic) energy, and should the circuit be disrupted, for example, by a plasma instability, the inductive energy will be released as plasma heating and acceleration. This is a common explanation for the heating that takes place in the [[solar corona]]. Electric currents, and in particular, magnetic-field-aligned electric currents (which are sometimes generically referred to as \"[[Birkeland current]]s\"), are also observed in the Earth's aurora, and in plasma filaments.\n\n===Cellular structure===\nNarrow sheets with sharp gradients may separate regions with different properties such as magnetization, density and temperature, resulting in cell-like regions. Examples include the [[magnetosphere]], [[heliosphere]], and [[heliospheric current sheet]]. [[Hannes Alfv\u00e9n]] wrote: \"From the cosmological point of view, the most important new space research discovery is probably the cellular structure of space. As has been seen in every region of space accessible to in situ measurements, there are a number of 'cell walls', sheets of electric currents, which divide space into compartments with different magnetization, temperature, density, etc.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Alfv\u00e9n, Hannes |title=Cosmic Plasma|date=1981|chapter=section VI.13.1. Cellular Structure of Space|isbn=978-90-277-1151-9|publisher=Dordrecht}}</ref>\n\n===Critical ionization velocity===\nThe [[critical ionization velocity]] is the relative velocity between an ionized plasma and a neutral gas, above which a runaway ionization process takes place. The critical ionization process is a quite general mechanism for the conversion of the kinetic energy of a rapidly streaming gas into ionization and plasma thermal energy. Critical phenomena in general are typical of complex systems, and may lead to sharp spatial or temporal features.\n\n===Ultracold plasma===\nUltracold plasmas are created in a [[magneto-optical trap]] (MOT) by trapping and cooling neutral [[atoms]], to temperatures of 1&nbsp;[[millikelvin|mK]] or lower, and then using another [[laser]] to [[ionize]] the atoms by giving each of the outermost electrons just enough energy to escape the electrical attraction of its parent ion.\n\nOne advantage of ultracold plasmas are their well characterized and tunable initial conditions, including their size and electron temperature. By adjusting the wavelength of the ionizing laser, the kinetic energy of the liberated electrons can be tuned as low as 0.1 K, a limit set by the frequency bandwidth of the laser pulse. The ions inherit the millikelvin temperatures of the neutral atoms, but are quickly heated through a process known as disorder induced heating (DIH). This type of non-equilibrium ultracold plasma evolves rapidly, and displays many other interesting phenomena.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rHo6IbakG2kC&pg=PA190|pages=190\u2013193|title=Plasma science: advancing knowledge in the national interest|author=National Research Council (U.S.).

A plasma with a significant excess of charge density, or, in the extreme case, is composed of a single species, is called a [[Non-neutral plasmas|non-neutral plasma]]. In such a plasma, electric fields play a dominant role. Examples are charged [[particle beam]]s, an electron cloud in a [[Penning trap]] and positron plasmas.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Greaves | first1 = R. G. | last2 = Tinkle | first2 = M.

They also showed that upon maintaining the impermeability for a few tens of seconds, screening of [[ions]] at the plasma-gas interface could give rise to a strong secondary mode of heating (known as viscous heating) leading to different kinetics of reactions and formation of complex [[nanomaterials]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yaghoubi |first1=A. |last2=M\u00e9linon |first2=P.|title= Tunable synthesis and in situ growth of silicon-carbon mesostructures using impermeable plasma |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=3 |pages=1083 |date=2013 |doi=10.1038/srep01083|bibcode = 2013NatSR...3E1083Y |pmid=23330064 |pmc=3547321}}</ref>\n\n==Mathematical descriptions==\n[[File:Magnetic rope.svg|thumb|The complex self-constricting magnetic field lines and current paths in a field-aligned [[Birkeland current]] that can develop in a plasma.<ref>See [http://history.nasa.gov/SP-345/ch15.htm#250 Evolution of the Solar System]'', 1976''</ref>]]\n{{main article|Plasma modeling}}\nTo completely describe the state of a plasma, we would need to write down all the\nparticle locations and velocities and describe the electromagnetic field in the plasma region.\nHowever, it is generally not practical or necessary to keep track of all the particles in a plasma.\nTherefore, plasma physicists commonly use less detailed descriptions, of which\nthere are two main types:\n\n===Fluid model===\nFluid models describe plasmas in terms of smoothed quantities, like density and averaged velocity around each position (see [[Plasma parameters]]). One simple fluid model, [[magnetohydrodynamics]], treats the plasma as a single fluid governed by a combination of [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]. A more general description is the [[two-fluid plasma]] picture, where the ions and electrons are described separately. Fluid models are often accurate when collisionality is sufficiently high to keep the plasma velocity distribution close to a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]]. Because fluid models usually describe the plasma in terms of a single flow at a certain temperature at each spatial location, they can neither capture velocity space structures like beams or [[Double layer (plasma)|double layer]]s, nor resolve wave-particle effects.\n\n===Kinetic model===\nKinetic models describe the particle velocity distribution function at each point in the plasma and therefore do not need to assume a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]]. A kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless plasmas. There are two common approaches to kinetic description of a plasma. One is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on a grid in velocity and position. The other, known as the [[particle-in-cell]] (PIC) technique, includes kinetic information by following the trajectories of a large number of individual particles. Kinetic models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid models. The [[Vlasov equation]] may be used to describe the dynamics of a system of charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field.\nIn magnetized plasmas, a [[gyrokinetics|gyrokinetic]] approach can substantially reduce the computational expense of a fully kinetic simulation.\n\n==Artificial plasmas==\nMost artificial plasmas are generated by the application of electric and/or magnetic fields through a gas. Plasma generated in a laboratory setting and for industrial use can be generally categorized by:\n*The type of power source used to generate the plasma\u2014DC, RF and microwave\n*The pressure they operate at\u2014vacuum pressure (< 10&nbsp;mTorr or 1 Pa), moderate pressure (~ 1&nbsp;Torr or 100 Pa), atmospheric pressure (760&nbsp;Torr or 100 kPa)\n*The degree of ionization within the plasma\u2014fully, partially, or weakly ionized\n*The temperature relationships within the plasma\u2014thermal plasma (<math>T_e = T_i = T_{gas}</math>), non-thermal or \"cold\" plasma (<math>T_e \\gg T_i = T_{gas}</math>)\n*The electrode configuration used to generate the plasma\n*The magnetization of the particles within the plasma\u2014magnetized (both ion and electrons are trapped in [[Gyroradius|Larmor orbits]] by the magnetic field), partially magnetized (the electrons but not the ions are trapped by the magnetic field), non-magnetized (the magnetic field is too weak to trap the particles in orbits but may generate [[Lorentz force]]s)\n\n===Generation of artificial plasma===\n[[File:Simple representation of a discharge tube - plasma.png|thumb]]\n[[File:Plasma jacobs ladder.jpg|thumb|alt=Artificial plasma produced in air by a Jacob's Ladder|Artificial plasma produced in air by a [[Spark gap#Visual entertainment|Jacob's Ladder]]]]\nJust like the many uses of plasma, there are several means for its generation, however, one principle is common to all of them: there must be energy input to produce and sustain it.<ref name=\"Hippler\" /> For this case, plasma is generated when an [[electric current]] is applied across a [[dielectric gas]] or fluid (an electrically [[Electrical conductor|non-conducting]] material) as can be seen in the adjacent image, which shows a [[discharge tube]] as a simple example ([[direct current|DC]] used for simplicity).\n\nThe [[potential difference]] and subsequent [[electric field]] pull the bound electrons (negative) toward the [[anode]] (positive electrode) while the [[cathode]] (negative electrode) pulls the nucleus.<ref name=\"Chen\">{{cite book |title=Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion |last=Chen |first=Francis F. |date=1984 |publisher=Plenum Press |isbn=978-0-306-41332-2}}</ref> As the [[voltage]] increases, the current stresses the material (by [[electric polarization]]) beyond its [[dielectric strength|dielectric limit]] (termed strength) into a stage of [[electrical breakdown]], marked by an [[electric spark]], where the material transforms from being an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] into a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] (as it becomes increasingly [[ionized]]). The underlying process is the [[Townsend avalanche]], where collisions between electrons and neutral gas atoms create more ions and electrons (as can be seen in the figure on the right). The first impact of an electron on an atom results in one ion and two electrons.
