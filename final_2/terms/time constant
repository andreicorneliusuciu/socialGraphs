In an increasing system, the time constant is the time for the system's [[step response]] to reach <math>1-1/e \\approx 63.2\\,\\%</math> of its final (asymptotic) value(say from a step increase). In radioactive decay the time constant is called the [[decay constant]] ('''\u03bb'''), and it represents both the mean lifetime of a decaying system (such as an atom) before it decays, or the time it takes for all but 36.8% of the atoms to decay. For this reason, the time constant is longer than the [[half-life]], which is the time for only 50% of the atoms to decay.\n\n==Differential equation==\n{{main|LTI system theory}}\nFirst order LTI systems are characterized by the differential equation\n:<math>\n{\\tau}{dV \\over dt} + V = f(t)\n</math>\n\nwhere \u03c4 represents the [[exponential decay]] constant and ''V'' is a function of time ''t''\n:<math>\nV  =  V(t). \n</math>\nThe right-hand side is the ''forcing function'' ''f(t)'' describing an external driving function of time, which can be regarded as the system ''input'', to which ''V(t)'' is the ''response'', or system output. Classical examples for ''f(t)'' are:\n\nThe [[Heaviside step function]], often denoted by ''u(t)'':\n:<math>u(t)=\\begin{cases} 0, & t < 0 \\\\ 1, & t \\ge 0 \\end{cases} </math>\nthe [[Dirac delta function|impulse function]], often denoted by ''\u03b4(t)'', and also the sinusoidal input function:\n:<math>\nf(t) = A \\sin(2 \\pi f t)\n</math>\nor\n:<math>\nf(t) = A e^{j \\omega t }, \n</math>\nwhere ''A'' is the ''amplitude'' of the forcing function, ''f'' is the frequency in Hertz, and \u03c9 = 2\u03c0 ''f''  is the frequency in radians per second.\n\n===Example solution===\nAn example solution to the differential equation with initial value ''V''<sub>0</sub> and no forcing function is\n:<math>\nV(t)  = V_o e^{-t / \\tau}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>\nV_o  =  V(t=0)\n</math>\n\nis the initial value of ''V''. Thus, the response is an exponential decay with time constant ''\u03c4''.\n\n====Discussion====\n\nSuppose\n:<math>V(t) =  V_0 e^{-{t \\over \\tau}}.</math>\n\nThis behavior is referred to as a \"decaying\" exponential function. The time <math>\\tau</math> (tau) is referred to as the \"time constant\" and can be used (as in this case) to indicate how rapidly an exponential function decays.\n\nHere: \n:''t'' = time (generally <math>t>0</math> in control engineering)\n:''V''<sub>0</sub> = initial value (see \"specific cases\" below).\n\n====Specific cases====\n\n:1) Let <math>t=0</math>; then <math>V=V_0   e^0</math>, and so <math>V=V_0</math>\n:2) Let <math>t= \\tau</math>; then <math>V=V_0  e^{-1} \\approx 0.37 V_0 </math>\n:3) Let <math>V=f(t)=V_0  e^{-{t \\over \\tau}}</math>, and so <math> \\lim_{t \\to \\infty}f(t) = 0 </math>\n:4) Let <math>t=5 \\tau</math>; then <math>V=V_0 e^{-5} \\approx 0.0067V_0 </math>\nAfter a period of one time constant the function reaches e<sup>\u22121</sup> = approximately 37% of its initial value. In case 4, after five time constants the function reaches a value less than 1% of its original. In most cases this 1% threshold is considered sufficient to assume that the function has decayed to zero - as a rule of thumb, in control engineering a stable system is one that exhibits such an overall damped behavior.\n\n==Relation of time constant to bandwidth==\n[[File:Single-pole sine wave response.JPG|thumb|300px|An example response of system to sine wave forcing function.

This is the usual [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] convention, defined as the frequency range where power drops by less than half (at most &minus;3&nbsp;dB). Using the frequency in hertz, rather than radians/s (\u03c9 = 2\u03c0''f''):\n\n:<math>\nf_{3dB} = \\frac {1}{2 \\pi \\tau}. </math>\n\nThe notation ''f<sub>3dB</sub>'' stems from the expression of power in [[decibels]] and the observation that half-power corresponds to a drop in the value of ''|V<sub>\u221e</sub>|'' by a factor of 1/\u221a2 or by 3 decibels.\n\nThus, the time constant determines the bandwidth of this system.\n\n==Step response with arbitrary initial conditions==\n[[File:Single-pole step response.JPG|thumb|300px|Step response of system for two different initial values ''V''<sub>0</sub>, one above the final value and one at zero.

The general solution to this equation for times ''t'' \u2265 0 s, assuming ''V(t=0) = V<sub>0</sub>'' is:\n\n:<math>\nV(t) = V_0e^{-t/\\tau} +A  \\tau \\left( 1 - e^{-t/\\tau}\\right).</math>\n\n(It may be observed that this response is the \u03c9 \u2192 0 limit of the above response to a sinusoidal input.)\n\nThe long-time solution is time independent and independent of initial conditions:\n:<math>\nV_{\\infty} = A \\tau. </math>\n\nThe time constant remains the same for the same system regardless of the starting conditions. Simply stated, a system approaches its final, steady-state situation at a constant rate, regardless of how close it is to that value at any arbitrary starting point.\n\nFor example, consider an electric motor whose startup is well modeled by a first-order LTI system.  Suppose that when started from rest, the motor takes \u215b of a second to reach 63% of its nominal speed of 100 RPM, or 63 RPM&mdash;a shortfall of 37 RPM.  Then it will be found that after the next \u215b of a second, the motor has sped up an additional 23 RPM, which equals 63% of that 37 RPM difference.  This brings it to 86 RPM&mdash;still 14 RPM low.  After a third \u215b of a second, the motor will have gained an additional 9 RPM (63% of that 14 RPM difference), putting it at 95 RPM.\n\nIn fact, given ''any'' initial speed '''''s''''' &le; 100 RPM, \u215b of a second later this particular motor will have gained an additional 0.63 &times; (100 &minus; '''''s''''') RPM.\n\n==Examples of time constants==\n\n===Time constants in electrical circuits===\n[[File:Series RC capacitor voltage.svg|thumb|right|230px|Capacitor voltage step-response.]]\n[[File:Series RC resistor voltage.svg|thumb|right|230px|Inductor voltage step-response.]]\n\nIn an [[RL circuit]] composed of a single resistor and inductor, the time constant ''<math>\\tau</math>'' (in [[second]]s) is \n:<math>\n\\tau  =  { L \\over R }\n</math>\n\nwhere ''R'' is the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] (in [[ohm]]s) and ''L'' is the [[inductance]] (in [[Henry (unit)|Henrys]]).\n\nSimilarly, in an [[RC circuit]] composed of a single resistor and capacitor, the time constant ''<math>\\tau</math>'' (in seconds) is:\n:<math>\n\\tau  =  R C\n</math>\n\nwhere ''R'' is the resistance (in [[ohm]]s) and ''C'' is the [[capacitance]] (in [[farad]]s).\n\nElectrical circuits are often more complex than these examples, and may exhibit multiple time constants (See [[Step response]] and [[Pole splitting]] for some examples.) In the case where [[Negative feedback amplifier|feedback]] is present, a system may exhibit unstable, increasing oscillations. In addition, physical electrical circuits are seldom truly linear systems except for very low amplitude excitations; however, the approximation of linearity is widely used.\n\nIn digital electronic circuits another measure, the [[fanout of 4|FO4]] is often used.  This can be converted to time constant units via the equation <math>5\\tau = \\text{FO4}</math>.<ref>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1292037</ref>\n\n===Thermal time constant===<!-- [[Thermal time constant]] redirects to this section -->\n\nTime constants are a feature of the [[lumped system analysis]] (lumped capacity analysis method) for thermal systems, used when objects cool or warm uniformly under the influence of [[Convective heat transfer|convective cooling or warming]]. In this case, the heat transfer from the body to the ambient at a given time is proportional to the temperature difference between the body and the ambient:<ref name=Lewis>\n{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of the finite element method for heat and fluid flow |author1=Roland Wynne Lewis |author2=Perumal Nithiarasu |author3=K.

The positive sign indicates the convention that ''F'' is positive when heat is ''leaving'' the body because its temperature is higher than the ambient temperature (''F'' is an outward flux). If heat is lost to the ambient, this heat transfer leads to a drop in temperature of the body given by:<ref name=Lewis/>\n\n:<math> \\rho  c_p  V \\frac {dT}{dt} = -F, </math>\n\nwhere \u03c1 = density, ''c''<sub>p</sub> = [[specific heat]] and ''V'' is the body volume. The negative sign indicates the temperature drops when the heat transfer is ''outward'' from the body (that is, when ''F'' > 0). Equating these two expressions for the heat transfer,\n\n:<math>  \\rho c_p V \\frac {dT}{dt} =  -hA_s \\left( T(t) - T_a \\right). </math>\n\nEvidently, this is a first-order LTI system that can be cast in the form:\n\n:<math>\\frac {dT}{dt} +\\frac {1}{\\tau} T = \\frac{1}{\\tau} T_a, </math>\n\nwith\n\n:<math>\n\\tau  =  \\frac{\\rho c_p V}{hA_s}.\n</math>\n\nIn other words, the time constant says that larger masses ''\u03c1V'' and larger heat capacities ''c''<sub>p</sub> lead to slower changes in temperature, while larger surface areas ''A''<sub>s</sub> and better heat transfer ''h'' lead to faster temperature changes.\n\nComparison with the introductory [[#Differential_equation|differential equation]] suggests the possible generalization to time-varying ambient temperatures ''T''<sub>a</sub>. However, retaining the simple constant ambient example, by substituting the variable ''\u0394T'' \u2261 (''T \u2212 T''<sub>a</sub>), one finds:\n\n:<math>\\frac {d\\Delta T}{dt} +\\frac {1}{\\tau} \\Delta T = 0. </math>\n\nSystems for which cooling satisfies the above exponential equation are said to satisfy [[Newton's law of cooling]]. The solution to this equation suggests that, in such systems, the difference between the temperature of the system and its surroundings ''\u0394T'' as a function of time ''t'', is given by:\n\n: <math> \\Delta T(t) = \\Delta T_0 e^{-t/\\tau}, </math>\n\nwhere ''\u0394T''<sub>0</sub> is the initial temperature difference, at time ''t''= 0. In words, the body assumes the same temperature as the ambient at an exponentially slow rate determined by the time constant.\n\n===Time constants in neuroscience===\nIn an [[action potential]] (or even in a passive spread of signal) in a [[neuron]], the time constant ''<math>\\tau</math>'' is\n:<math>\n\\tau  = r_{m} c_{m}\n</math>\n\nwhere ''r''<sub>m</sub> is the resistance across the membrane and ''c''<sub>m</sub> is the [[capacitance]] of the membrane.\n\nThe resistance across the membrane is a function of the number of open [[ion channels]] and the capacitance is a function of the properties of the [[lipid bilayer]].\n\nThe time constant is used to describe the rise and fall of membrane voltage, where the rise is described by\n:<math>\nV(t)  =  V_\\textrm{max} (1 - e^{-t /\\tau})\n</math>\n\nand the fall is described by\n:<math>\nV(t)  =  V_\\textrm{max} e^{-t /\\tau}\n</math>\n\nwhere [[voltage]] is in millivolts, time is in seconds, and ''<math>\\tau</math>'' is in seconds.\n\nV<sub>max</sub> is defined as the maximum voltage attained in the action potential, where \n:<math>\nV_\\textrm{max} =  r_{m}I\n</math>\n\nwhere ''r''<sub>m</sub> is the resistance across the membrane and ''I'' is the current.\n\nSetting for ''t'' = ''<math>\\tau</math>'' for the rise sets ''V''(''t'') equal to 0.63''V''<sub>max</sub>. This means that the time constant is the time elapsed after 63% of ''V''<sub>max</sub> has been reached\n\nSetting for ''t'' = ''<math>\\tau</math>'' for the fall sets ''V''(''t'') equal to 0.37''V''<sub>max</sub>, meaning that the time constant is the time elapsed after it has fallen to 37% of ''V''<sub>max</sub>.\n\nThe larger a time constant is, the slower the rise or fall of the potential of a neuron. A long time constant can result in [[temporal summation]], or the algebraic summation of repeated potentials. A short time constant rather produces a [[Coincidence detection in neurobiology|coincidence detector]] through [[spatial summation]].\n\n===Exponential decay===\n{{further|Exponential decay}}\nIn [[exponential decay]], such as of a [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] isotope, the time constant can be interpreted as the [[mean lifetime]]. The [[half-life]] ''T''<sub>''HL''</sub> is related to the exponential time constant <math>\\tau</math> by\n:<math>\nT_{HL} = \\tau \\cdot \\mathrm{ln}\\,2. \n</math>\nThe reciprocal of the time constant is called the [[decay constant]], and is denoted <math>\\lambda = 1/\\tau.</math>\n\n===Meteorological sensors===\nA '''time constant''' is the amount of time it takes for a meteorological sensor to respond to a rapid change in a measurand until it is measuring values within the accuracy tolerance usually expected of the sensor.\n\nThis most often applies to measurements of temperature, dewpoint temperature, humidity and air pressure. [[Radiosonde]]s are especially affected due to their rapid increase in altitude.\n\n==See also==\n*[[RC time constant]]\n*[[Cutoff frequency]]\n*[[Exponential decay]]\n*[[Length constant]]\n*[[Rise time]]\n*[[Fall time]]\n*[[Frequency response]]\n*[[Impulse response]]\n*[[Step response]]\n*[[Transition time]]\n*[[Settling time]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-timeconstant.htm Conversion of time constant \u03c4 to cutoff frequency fc and vice versa]\n*[http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_1/chpt_16/4.html All about circuits - Voltage and current calculations]\n*[http://amazon.com/dp/B01F18XGQK Energy and Thermal Time Constant of Buildings]\n[[Category:Physical constants]]\n[[Category:Neurobiology]]"}]}}}}
