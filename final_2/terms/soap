The insoluble oil/fat molecules become associated inside [[micelles]], tiny spheres formed from soap molecules with polar [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] (water-attracting) groups on the outside and encasing a [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] (fat-attracting) pocket, which shields the oil/fat molecules from the water making it soluble. Anything that is soluble will be washed away with the water.\n\n===Effect of the alkali===\nThe type of alkali metal used determines the kind of soap product. Sodium soaps, prepared from [[sodium hydroxide]], are firm, whereas potassium soaps, derived from [[potassium hydroxide]], are softer or often liquid. Historically, potassium hydroxide was extracted from the ashes of [[bracken]] or other plants. Lithium soaps also tend to be hard\u2014these are used exclusively in [[grease (lubricant)|grease]]s.\n\n===Effects of fats===\n{{see also|Total fatty matter}}\nSoaps are derivatives of [[fatty acid]]s.

Typical vegetable oils used in soap making are palm oil, coconut oil, olive oil, and laurel oil. Each species offers quite different fatty acid content and hence, results in soaps of distinct feel. The seed oils give softer but milder soaps. Soap made from pure [[olive oil]] is sometimes called [[Castile soap]] or [[Marseille soap]], and is reputed for being extra mild.

His son-in-law, [[Thomas J. Barratt]], opened a factory in [[Isleworth]] in 1862.\n\n[[William Gossage]] produced low-priced, good-quality soap from the 1850s. [[Robert Spear Hudson (soap)|Robert Spear Hudson]] began manufacturing a soap powder in 1837, initially by grinding the soap with a [[mortar and pestle]]. American manufacturer [[Benjamin T. Babbitt]] introduced marketing innovations that included sale of bar soap and distribution of [[product sample]]s. [[William Hesketh Lever]] and his brother, James, bought a small soap works in [[Warrington]] in 1886 and founded what is still one of the largest soap businesses, formerly called Lever Brothers and now called [[Unilever]]. These soap businesses were among the first to employ large-scale [[advertising]] campaigns.\n\n== Liquid soap ==\n{{See also|Detergent}}\n\nLiquid soap was not invented until the nineteenth century; in 1865, William Shepphard patented a liquid version of soap. In 1898, B.J. Johnson developed a soap (made of palm and olive oils); his company (the [[Colgate-Palmolive#History|B.J. Johnson Soap Company]]) introduced \"[[Palmolive (soap)|Palmolive]]\" brand soap that same year. This new brand of the new kind of soap became popular rapidly, and to such a degree that B.J.

Such products as [[Pine-Sol]] and [[Tide (brand)|Tide]] appeared on the market, making the process of cleaning things other than skin (e.g., clothing, floors, bathrooms) much easier.\n\nLiquid soap also works better for more traditional/non-machine washing methods, such as using a [[Washboard (laundry)|washboard]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The History of Liquid Soap|url=http://www.blueaspenoriginals.org/liquid-soap.html|publisher=Blue Aspen Originals|accessdate=17 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|Soapmaking|Soap-making}} Soap-making processes==\nThe industrial production of soap involves continuous processes, such as continuous addition of fat and removal of product. Smaller-scale production involves the traditional [[batch production|batch processes]]. The three variations are: the 'cold process', wherein the reaction takes place substantially at room temperature, the 'semiboiled' or 'hot process', wherein the reaction takes place near the boiling point, and the 'fully boiled process', wherein the reactants are boiled at least once and the [[glycerol]] is recovered. There are several types of 'semiboiled' hot process methods, the most common being DBHP (Double Boiler Hot Process) and CPHP (Crock Pot Hot Process).<ref>Garzena, Patrizia, and Tadiello, Marina (2013). ''The Natural Soapmaking Handbook''. [http://www.demetra.com.au/ Online information and Table of Contents]. ISBN 978-0-9874995-0-9/</ref> Most soapmakers, however, continue to prefer the cold process method. The cold process and hot process (semiboiled) are the simplest and typically used by small artisans and hobbyists producing handmade decorative soaps. The [[glycerine]] remains in the soap and the reaction continues for many days after the soap is poured into [[Mold (cooking implement)|mold]]s. The glycerine is left during the hot-process method, but at the high temperature employed, the reaction is practically completed in the kettle, before the soap is poured into molds. This simple and quick process is employed in small factories all over the world.\n\nHandmade soap from the cold process also differs from industrially made soap in that an excess of fat is used, beyond that needed to consume the [[alkali]] (in a cold-pour process, this excess fat is called \u201csuperfatting\u201d), and the glycerine left in acts as a moisturizing agent. However, the glycerine also makes the soap softer and less resistant to becoming \u201cmushy\u201d if left wet. Since it is better to add too much oil and have left-over fat, than to add too much [[lye]] and have left-over lye, soap produced from the hot process also contains left-over glycerine and its concomitant pros and cons. Further addition of glycerine and processing of this soap produces [[glycerin soap]]. Superfatted soap is more skin-friendly than one without extra fat. However, if too much fat is added, it can leave a \u201cgreasy\u201d feel to the skin. Sometimes, an [[Moisturizer|emollient]] additive, such as [[jojoba]] oil or [[shea butter]], is added \u201cat trace\u201d (i.e., the point at which the [[saponification]] process is sufficiently advanced that the soap has begun to thicken in the cold process method) in the belief that nearly all the lye will be spent and it will escape saponification and remain intact. In the case of hot-process soap, an emollient may be added after the initial oils have saponified so they remain unreacted in the finished soap. Superfatting can also be accomplished through a process known as \u201clye discount\u201d in which the soap maker uses less alkali than required instead of adding extra fats.\n\n===Cold process===\n[[File:Pouring lye into water to make soap.jpg|thumbnail|right|The [[lye]] is dissolved in water.]]\n\nEven in the cold soap making process, some heat is usually required; the temperature is usually raised to a point sufficient to ensure complete melting of the fat being used. The batch may also be kept warm for some time after mixing to ensure the [[Lye|alkali (hydroxide)]] is completely used up. This soap is safe to use after about 12\u201348 hours, but is not at its peak quality for use for several weeks.\n\nCold-process soapmaking requires exact measurements of lye and fat amounts and computing their ratio, using saponification charts to ensure the finished product does not contain any excess hydroxide or too much free unreacted fat. Saponification charts should also be used in hot processes, but are not necessary for the \u201cfully boiled hot-process\u201d soaping.\n\nHistorically, lye used in the cold process was made from scratch using rainwater and ashes. Soapmakers deemed the lye solution ready for use when an egg would float in it. Homemade lye making for this process was unpredictable and therefore eventually led to the discovery of the sodium hydroxide by English chemist [[Sir Humphry Davy]] in the early 1800s.\n\nA cold-process soapmaker first looks up the saponification value for each unique fat on an oil specification sheet. Oil specification sheets contain laboratory test results for each fat, including the precise saponification value of the fat. The saponification value for a specific fat will vary by season and by specimen species.<ref>{{cite web|title=Quality Laboratory Oil Examination Procedures and Practices|url=http://www.aocs.org/index.cfm|publisher=American Oil Chemists' Society|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref> This value is used to calculate the exact amount of sodium hydroxide to react with the fat to form soap. The saponification value must be converted into an equivalent sodium hydroxide value for use in cold process soapmaking. Excess unreacted lye in the soap will result in a very high pH and can burn or irritate skin; not enough lye leaves the soap greasy. Most soap makers formulate their recipes with a 2\u20135% deficit of lye, to account for the unknown deviation of saponification value between their oil batch and laboratory averages.\n\nThe lye is dissolved in water. Then oils are heated, or melted if they are solid at room temperature. Once the oils are liquefied and the lye is fully dissolved in water, they are combined. This lye-fat mixture is mixed until the two phases (oils and water) are fully emulsified. [[Emulsion|Emulsification]] is most easily identified visually when the soap exhibits some level of \u201ctrace\u201d, which is the thickening of the mixture. Many modern-day amateur soapmakers often use a stick blender to speed up this process. There are varying levels of trace. Depending on how additives will affect trace, they may be added at light trace, medium trace, or heavy trace. After much stirring, the mixture turns to the consistency of a thin pudding. \u201cTrace\u201d corresponds roughly to viscosity. [[Essential oil]]s and [[fragrance oil]]s can be added with the initial soaping oils, but solid additives such as botanicals, herbs, oatmeal, or other additives are most commonly added at light trace, just as the mixture starts to thicken.\n\nThe batch is then poured into molds, kept warm with towels or blankets, and left to continue saponification for 12 to 48 hours. (Milk soaps or other soaps with sugars added are the exception. They typically do not require insulation, as the presence of sugar increases the speed of the reaction and thus the production of heat.) During this time, it is normal for the soap to go through a \u201cgel phase\u201d, wherein the opaque soap will turn somewhat transparent for several hours, before once again turning opaque.\n\nAfter the insulation period, the soap is firm enough to be removed from the mold and cut into bars. At this time, it is safe to use the soap, since saponification is in essence complete. However, cold-process soaps are typically cured and hardened on a drying rack for 2\u20136 weeks before use. During this cure period, trace amounts of residual lye are consumed by saponification and excess water evaporates.\n\nDuring the curing process, some molecules in the outer layer of the solid soap react with the carbon dioxide of the air and produce a dusty sheet of [[sodium carbonate]]. This reaction is more intense if the mass is exposed to wind or low temperatures.\n\n====Hot processes====\nHot-processed soaps are created by encouraging the saponification reaction by adding heat to speed up the reaction. In contrast with cold-pour soap which is poured into molds and for the most part only then saponifies, hot-process soaping for the most part saponifies the oils completely and only then is poured into molds.\n\nIn the hot process, the hydroxide and the fat are heated and mixed together at 80\u2013100&nbsp;\u00b0C, a little below boiling point, until saponification is complete, which, before modern scientific equipment, the soapmaker determined by taste (the sharp, distinctive taste of the hydroxide disappears after it is saponified) or by eye; the experienced eye can tell when gel stage and full saponification has occurred. Beginners can find this information through research and classes. Tasting soap for readiness is not recommended, as sodium and potassium hydroxides, when not saponified, are highly caustic.\n\nAn advantage of the fully boiled hot process in soapmaking is the exact amount of hydroxide required need not be known with great accuracy. They originated when the purity of the alkali hydroxides were unreliable, as these processes can use even naturally found alkalis, such as wood ashes and potash deposits. In the fully boiled process, the mix is actually boiled (100+ \u00b0C), and, after saponification has occurred, the \u201cneat soap\u201d is [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitated]] from the solution by adding common salt, and the excess liquid is drained off. This excess liquid carries away with it much of the impurities and color compounds in the fat, to leave a purer, whiter soap, and with practically all the glycerine removed. The hot, soft soap is then pumped into a mold. The spent hydroxide solution is processed for recovery of glycerine.\n\n====Molds====\n[[File:Soap logs all natural.jpg|thumbnail|Logs of soap after demolding.]]\nMany commercially available soap molds are made of silicone or various types of plastic, although many soapmaking hobbyists may use cardboard boxes lined with a plastic film. Wooden molds, unlined or lined with silicone sleeves, are also readily available to the general public. Soaps can be made in long bars that are cut into individual portions, or cast into individual molds.\n\n===Purification and finishing===\nIn the fully boiled process on an industrial scale, the soap is further purified to remove any excess [[sodium hydroxide]], [[glycerol]], and other impurities, color compounds, etc. These components are removed by [[boiling]] the crude soap [[curd]]s in [[water]] and then precipitating the soap with salt.\n\nAt this stage, the soap still contains too much water, which has to be removed. This was traditionally done on chill rolls, which produced the soap flakes commonly used in the 1940s and 1950s. This process was superseded by spray dryers and then by vacuum dryers.\n\nThe dry soap (about 6\u201312% moisture) is then compacted into small pellets or noodles. These pellets or noodles are then ready for soap finishing, the process of converting raw soap pellets into a saleable product, usually bars.\n\nSoap pellets are combined with fragrances and other materials and blended to homogeneity in an amalgamator (mixer). The mass is then discharged from the mixer into a refiner, which, by means of an [[auger (drill)|auger]], forces the soap through a fine [[wire]] screen. From the refiner, the soap passes over a roller mill (French milling or hard milling) in a manner similar to [[calendering]] paper or plastic or to making [[chocolate liquor]]. The soap is then passed through one or more additional refiners to further plasticize the soap mass. Immediately before extrusion, the mass is passed through a vacuum chamber to remove any trapped air. It is then extruded into a long log or blank, cut to convenient lengths, passed through a metal detector, and then stamped into shape in refrigerated tools. The pressed bars are packaged in many ways.\n\n[[Sand]] or [[pumice]] may be added to produce a [[wiktionary:scouring|scouring]] soap. The scouring agents serve to remove dead cells from the skin surface being cleaned. This process is called [[exfoliation (cosmetology)|exfoliation]]. Many newer materials that are effective, yet do not have the sharp edges and poor particle size distribution of pumice, are used for exfoliating soaps.\n\nTo make [[antibacterial]] soap, compounds such as [[triclosan]] or [[triclocarban]] can be added. There is some concern that use of antibacterial soaps and other products might encourage [[antibiotic resistance]] in microorganisms.<ref name=\"AntibacterialABC\">{{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=117985 | title=Antibacterial Soaps Concern Experts | publisher=ABC News | accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\n|A generic bar of soap, after purification and finishing\nImage:Azul e Branco.JPG|[[Azul e branco soap]] \u2013 a bar of blue-white soap\nImage:Soap P1140887.jpg|Handmade soaps sold at a shop in [[Hy\u00e8res]], [[France]]\nImage:Savon de Marseille.jpg|Traditional [[Marseille soap]]</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Soap}}\n{{colbegin|3}}\n* [[African black soap]]\n* [[Aleppo soap]]\n* [[Antibiotic misuse]]\n* [[Castile soap]]\n* [[Detergent]]\n* [[Dishwashing soap]]\n* [[Foam]]\n* [[Lava (soap)]]\n* [[Marseille soap]]\n* [[Nabulsi soap]]\n* [[Hand washing]]\n* [[Hygiene]]\n* [[Saltwater soap]]\n* [[Saponification]]\n* [[Shampoo]]\n* [[Shaving soap]]\n* [[Soap bubble]]\n* [[Soap dish]]\n* [[Soap dispenser]]\n* [[Soap plant]]\n* [[Soap substitute]]\n* [[Soapwort]]\n* [[Shower gel]]\n* [[Toothpaste]]\n* [[Vegetarian soap]]\n* [[Soap made from human corpses]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Dunn, Kevin M.
