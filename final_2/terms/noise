From a physics standpoint, noise is indistinguishable from sound, as both are [[vibration]]s through a medium, such as air or water. The difference arises when the brain receives and perceives a sound.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://physics.info/sound/|title=The Nature of Sound \u2013 The Physics Hypertextbook|last=Elert|first=Glenn|website=physics.info|access-date=2016-06-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pages.jh.edu/~virtlab/ray/acoustic.htm|title=The Propagation of sound|website=pages.jh.edu|access-date=2016-06-20}}</ref>\n\nIn [[experimental science]]s, noise can refer to any random fluctuations of data that hinders perception of an expected signal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/noise|title=Definition of NOISE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-06-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/noise|title=noise: definition of noise in Oxford dictionary (American English) (US)|website=www.oxforddictionaries.com|access-date=2016-06-20}}</ref>\n\n[[Acoustic noise]] is any sound in the acoustic domain, either deliberate (e.g., music or speech) or unintended.

This variation from the expected pure sound or silence can be caused by the audio recording equipment, the instrument, or ambient noise in the recording room.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.audioshapers.com/blog/audio-noise.html|title=Audio Noise-Hiss,Hum,Rumble & Crackle|website=AudioShapers|access-date=2016-06-23}}</ref>\n\nIn [[audio engineering]] it can refer either to the acoustic noise from loudspeakers or to the unwanted residual electronic noise signal that gives rise to acoustic noise heard as 'hiss'.

Noise regulation includes statutes or guidelines relating to sound transmission established by national, state or provincial and municipal levels of government. Environmental noise is governed by laws and standards which set maximum recommended levels of noise for specific land uses, such as residential areas, areas of outstanding natural beauty, or schools.
