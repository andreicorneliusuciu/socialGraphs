The term was coined in 1960 by [[Manfred Clynes]] and [[Nathan S. Kline]].<ref>\"[http://web.mit.edu/digitalapollo/Documents/Chapter1/cyborgs.pdf Cyborgs and Space]\", in ''Astronautics'' (September 1960), by Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline.</ref>\n\nThe term cyborg is not the same thing as [[bionic]], [[biorobot]] or [[android (robot)|android]]; it applies to an organism that has restored function or enhanced abilities due to the integration of some artificial component or technology that relies on some sort of [[feedback]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Techno-human Shell-A Jump in the Evolutionary Gap | publisher=Sunbury Press | author=Carvalko, Joseph | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-62006-165-7}}</ref> While cyborgs are commonly thought of as [[mammal]]s, including humans, they might also conceivably be any kind of [[organism]].\n\nD. S. Halacy's ''Cyborg: Evolution of the Superman'' in 1965 featured an introduction which spoke of a \"new frontier\" that was \"not merely space, but more profoundly the relationship between 'inner space' to 'outer space' \u2013 a bridge...between mind and matter.\"<ref>D. S. Halacy, ''Cyborg: Evolution of the Superman'' (New York: Harper and Row Publishers, 1965), 7.</ref>\n\nIn popular culture, some cyborgs may be represented as visibly mechanical (e.g., the [[Cybermen]] in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' franchise or [[Borg (Star Trek)|The Borg]] from ''[[Star Trek]]'' or [[Darth Vader]] from ''[[Star Wars]]'') or as almost indistinguishable from humans (e.g., the [[Cylon (re-imagining)|\"Human\" Cylons]] from the [[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|re-imagining of ''Battlestar Galactica'']], etc.). Cyborgs in fiction often play up a human contempt for over-dependence on technology, particularly when used for war, and when used in ways that seem to threaten [[free will]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Cyborgs are also often portrayed with physical or mental abilities far exceeding a human counterpart (military forms may have inbuilt weapons, among other things).{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n== Overview ==\nAccording to some definitions of the term, the physical attachments [[human race|humanity]] has with even the most basic technologies have already made them cyborgs.<ref>[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Haraway/CyborgManifesto.html ''A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century''] by [[Donna Haraway]]</ref> In a typical example, a human with an [[artificial pacemaker|artificial cardiac pacemaker]] or [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]] would be considered a cyborg, since these devices measure voltage potentials in the body, perform signal processing, and can deliver electrical stimuli, using this synthetic [[feedback]] mechanism to keep that person alive. Implants, especially [[cochlear implant]]s, that combine mechanical modification with any kind of feedback response are also cyborg enhancements. Some theorists{{who|date=October 2014}} cite such modifications as [[contact lens]]es, [[hearing aid]]s, or [[intraocular lens]]es as examples of fitting humans with technology to enhance their biological capabilities. As cyborgs currently are on the rise some theorists argue there is a need to develop new definitions of aging and for instance a [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaging.2014.09.003 bio-techno-social definition of aging] has been suggested.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wejbrandt | first1 = A | year = 2014 | title = Defining aging in cyborgs: A bio-techno-social definition of aging | url = | journal = Journal of Aging Studies | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 104\u2013109 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaging.2014.09.003 }}</ref>\n\nThe term is also used to address human-[[technology]] mixtures in the abstract. This includes not only commonly used pieces of technology such as phones, computers, the Internet, etc. but also artifacts that may not popularly be considered technology; for example, pen and paper, and [[Speech communication|speech]] and [[language]]. When augmented with these technologies and connected in communication with people in other times and places, a person becomes capable of much more than they were before. This is like a computer, which gains power by using Internet protocols to connect with other computers. Cybernetic technologies include highways, pipes, electrical wiring, buildings, electrical plants, libraries, and other infrastructure that we hardly notice, but which are critical parts of the [[cybernetics]] that we work within.\n\n[[Bruce Sterling]] in his universe of [[Shaper/Mechanist]] suggested an idea of alternative cyborg called [[lobster (cyborg)|Lobster]], which is made not by using internal implants, but by using an external shell (''e.g.'' a [[Artificial powered exoskeleton|Powered Exoskeleton]]).<ref>Sterling, Bruce. Schismatrix. Arbor House. 1985.</ref> Unlike human cyborgs that appear human externally while being synthetic internally (''e.g.'' the Bishop type in the [[Alien (franchise)|Alien]] franchise), Lobster looks inhuman externally but contains a human internally (''e.g.'' [[Elysium (film)|Elysium]], [[RoboCop]]). The computer game ''[[Deus Ex: Invisible War]]'' prominently featured cyborgs called [[Omar (Deus Ex)|Omar]], where \"Omar\" is a Russian translation of the word \"Lobster\" (since the Omar are of Russian origin in the game).\n\n== Origins ==\nThe concept of a man-machine mixture was widespread in [[science fiction]] before World War II. As early as 1843, [[Edgar Allan Poe]] described a man with extensive prostheses in the short story \"[[The Man That Was Used Up]]\". In 1911, [[Jean de la Hire]] introduced the [[Nyctalope]], a science fiction hero who was perhaps the first literary cyborg, in ''Le Myst\u00e8re des XV'' (later translated as ''The Nyctalope on Mars'').<ref name=Zehr>{{cite book |last= Zehr |first= E.

He later featured the talking, living brain of an old scientist, Simon Wright, floating around in a transparent case, in all the adventures of his famous hero, [[Captain Future]]. He uses the term explicitly in the 1962 short story, \"After a Judgment Day,\" to describe the \"mechanical analogs\" called \"Charlies,\" explaining that \"[c]yborgs, they had been called from the first one in the 1960s...cybernetic organisms.\" In the short story \"No Woman Born\" in 1944, [[C. L. Moore]] wrote of Deirdre, a dancer, whose body was burned completely and whose brain was placed in a faceless but beautiful and supple mechanical body.\n\nThe term was coined by [[Manfred Clynes|Manfred E. Clynes]] and [[Nathan S. Kline]] in 1960 to refer to their conception of an [[superhuman|enhanced human]] being who could survive in [[extrasolar planet|extraterrestrial]] environments:\n\n{{Cquote|For the exogenously extended organizational complex functioning as an integrated homeostatic system unconsciously, we propose the term 'Cyborg'. \u2013 Manfred E.

A designer of [[physiology|physiological]] instrumentation and electronic data-processing systems, Clynes was the chief research scientist in the Dynamic Simulation Laboratory at Rockland State Hospital in New York.\n\nThe term first appears in print five months earlier when ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on the Psychophysiological Aspects of Space Flight Symposium where Clynes and Kline first presented their paper.\n\n{{Cquote|A cyborg is essentially a man-machine system in which the control mechanisms of the human portion are modified externally by drugs or regulatory devices so that the being can live in an environment different from the normal one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/bbcwordhunt/cyborg.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824072139/http://www.oed.com/bbcwordhunt/cyborg.html|title=Entry from OED Online|archivedate=24 August 2010|work=oed.com}}</ref>}}\n\nA book titled ''Cyborg: Digital Destiny and Human Possibility in the Age of the [[Wearable computing|Wearable Computer]]'' was published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cyborg:Digital Destiny and Human Possibility in the Age of the Wearable Computer|url=http://eyetap.org/cyborg.htm|publisher=By [[EyeTap (website)|EyeTap]]|accessdate=July 4, 2013}}</ref> Some of the ideas in the book were incorporated into the 35&nbsp;mm motion picture film [[Cyberman (movie)|''Cyberman'']].\n\n== Cyborg tissues in engineering ==\nCyborgs tissues structured with carbon nanotubes and plant or fungal cells have been used in artificial tissue engineering to produce new materials for mechanical and electrical uses.\nThe work was presented by Di Giacomo and Maresca at MRS 2013 Spring conference on Apr, 3rd, talk number SS4.04.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrs.org/s13-program-ss/|title=Program: Symposium SS: Bioelectronics\u2014Materials, Interfaces, and Applications|work=mrs.org}}</ref> The cyborg obtained is inexpensive, light and has unique mechanical properties. It can also be shaped in desired forms. Cells combined with MWCNTs co-precipitated as a specific aggregate of cells and nanotubes that formed a viscous material. Likewise, dried cells still acted as a stable matrix for the MWCNT network. When observed by optical microscopy the material resembled an artificial \u201ctissue\u201d composed of highly packed cells. The effect of cell drying is manifested by their \u201cghost cell\u201d appearance. A rather specific physical interaction between MWCNTs and cells was observed by electron microscopy suggesting that the cell wall (the most outer part of fungal and plant cells) may play a major active role in establishing a CNTs network and its stabilization. This novel material can be used in a wide range of electronic applications from heating to sensing and has the potential to open important new avenues to be exploited in electromagnetic shielding for radio frequency electronics and aerospace technology. In particular using Candida albicans cells cyborg tissue materials with temperature sensing properties have been reported.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6409466|title=IEEE Xplore \u2013 Sign In|work=ieee.org}}</ref>\n\n== Actual cyborgization attempts ==\n[[File:Neil Harbisson cyborgist.jpg|thumb|right|[[Neil Harbisson]], cyborg activist and president of the [[Cyborg Foundation]].<ref>*Miah, Andy / Rich, Emma.

One of the first scientists to come up with a working brain interface to restore sight was private researcher [[William H. Dobelle|William Dobelle]].\nDobelle's first prototype was implanted into \"Jerry\", a man blinded in adulthood, in 1978. A single-array BCI containing 68 electrodes was implanted onto Jerry's [[visual cortex]] and succeeded in producing [[phosphenes]], the sensation of seeing light. The system included cameras mounted on glasses to send signals to the implant. Initially, the implant allowed Jerry to see shades of grey in a limited field of vision at a low frame-rate. This also required him to be hooked up to a two-ton mainframe, but shrinking electronics and faster computers made his artificial eye more portable and now enable him to perform simple tasks unassisted.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.09/vision.html Vision quest], ''Wired Magazine'', September 2002</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Philip Kennedy, a scientist and physician, created the world's first human cyborg from  Johnny Ray, a Vietnam veteran who suffered a stroke. Ray's body, as doctors called it, was [[locked-in syndrome|\"locked in\"]]. Ray wanted his old life back so he agreed to Kennedy's experiment. Kennedy embedded an implant he designed (and named \"neurotrophic electrode\") near the part of Ray's brain so that Ray would be able to have some movement back in his body. The surgery went successfully, but in 2002, Johnny Ray died.<ref>Baker, Sherry. \"Rise Of The Cyborgs.\" Discover 29.10 (2008): 50. Science Reference Center.

The second generation device used a more sophisticated implant enabling better mapping of phosphenes into coherent vision. Phosphenes are spread out across the visual field in what researchers call the starry-night effect. Immediately after his implant, Jens was able to use his imperfectly restored vision to drive slowly around the parking area of the research institute.<ref>Macintyre, James [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/bmi-the-research-that-holds-the-key-to-hope-for-millions-835850.html BMI: the research that holds the key to hope for millions], [[The Independent]] 29 May 2008</ref>\n\nIn 2002, under the heading Project Cyborg, a British scientist, [[Kevin Warwick]], had an array of 100 electrodes fired into his nervous system in order to link his nervous system into the internet.

Restorative technologies \"restore lost function, organs, and limbs\".<ref>Gray, Chris Hables, ed. The Cyborg Handbook. New York: Routledge, 1995</ref> The key aspect of restorative cyborgization is the repair of broken or missing processes to revert to a healthy or average level of function. There is no enhancement to the original faculties and processes that were lost.\n\nOn the contrary, the enhanced cyborg \"follows a principle, and it is the principle of optimal performance: maximising output (the information or modifications obtained) and minimising input (the energy expended in the process)\".<ref>Lyotard, Jean Fran\u00e7ois: The postmodern condition: A report on knowledge. Minneapolis:  [[University of Minnesota Press]], 1984</ref> Thus, the enhanced cyborg intends to exceed normal processes or even gain new functions that were not originally present.\n\nAlthough prostheses in general supplement lost or damaged body parts with the integration of a mechanical artifice, bionic implants in medicine allow model organs or body parts to mimic the original function more closely.

The ethics and desirability of \"enhancement prosthetics\" have been debated; their proponents include the [[Transhumanism|transhumanist]] movement, with its belief that new technologies can assist the human race in developing beyond its present, normative limitations such as aging and disease, as well as other, more general incapacities, such as limitations on speed, strength, endurance, and intelligence. Opponents of the concept describe what they believe to be biases which propel the development and acceptance of such technologies; namely, a bias towards functionality and efficiency that may compel assent to a view of human people which de-emphasizes as defining characteristics actual manifestations of humanity and personhood, in favor of definition in terms of upgrades, versions, and utility.<ref>Marsen, Sky. \"[http://jetpress.org/v19/marsen.htm Becoming More Than Human: Technology and the Post-Human Condition Introduction]\".

Research of Invasive BCIs, which utilize electrodes implanted directly into the grey matter of the brain, has focused on restoring damaged eyesight in the blind and providing functionality to paralyzed people, most notably those with severe cases, such as [[Locked-In syndrome]]. This technology could enable people who are missing a limb or are in a wheelchair the power to control the devices that aide them through neural signals sent from the brain implants directly to computers or the devices. It is possible that this technology will also eventually be used with healthy people.<ref>Baker, Sherry. \"RISE OF THE CYBORGS.\" Discover 29.10 (2008): 50\u201357. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO.

This process has aided in treating patients diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Tourette syndrome]], epilepsy, chronic headaches, and mental disorders. After the patient is unconscious, through anesthesia, brain pacemakers or electrodes, are implanted into the region of the brain where the cause of the disease is present. The region of the brain is then stimulated by bursts of electric current to disrupt the oncoming surge of seizures. Like all invasive procedures, deep brain stimulation may put the patient at a higher risk. However, there have been more improvements in recent years with deep brain stimulation than any available drug treatment.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gallagher|first=James|title=Alzheimer's: Deep brain stimulation 'reverses' disease|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15890749|work=BBC News|date=28 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Retinal implant]]s are another form of cyborgization in medicine. The theory behind retinal stimulation to restore vision to people suffering from retinitis pigmentosa and vision loss due to aging (conditions in which people have an abnormally low amount of ganglion cells) is that the retinal implant and electrical stimulation would act as a substitute for the missing ganglion cells (cells which connect the eye to the brain.)\n\nWhile work to perfect this technology is still being done, there have already been major advances in the use of electronic stimulation of the retina to allow the eye to sense patterns of light. A specialized camera is worn by the subject, such as on the frames of their glasses, which converts the image into a pattern of electrical stimulation. A chip located in the user's eye would then electrically stimulate the retina with this pattern by exciting certain nerve endings which transmit the image to the optic centers of the brain and the image would then appear to the user.  If technological advances proceed as planned this technology may be used by thousands of blind people and restore vision to most of them.\n\nA similar process has been created to aide people who have lost their vocal cords. This experimental device would do away with previously used robotic sounding voice simulators. The transmission of sound would start with a surgery to redirect the nerve that controls the voice and sound production to a muscle in the neck, where a nearby sensor would be able to pick up its electrical signals. The signals would then move to a processor which would control the timing and pitch of a voice simulator. That simulator would then vibrate producing a multitonal sound which could be shaped into words by the mouth.<ref>Thurston, Bonnie. \"Was blind, but now I see.\" 11.

By using [[3D printing]] and computer modeling these scientist developed an electronic membrane that could successfully replace pacemakers. The device utilizes a \"spider-web like network of sensors and electrodes\" to monitor and maintain a normal heart-rate with electrical stimuli. Unlike traditional pacemakers that are similar from patient to patient, the elastic heart glove is made custom by using high-resolution imaging technology. The first prototype was created to fit a rabbit's heart, operating the organ in an oxygen and nutrient-rich solution. The stretchable material and circuits of the apparatus were first constructed by Professor [[John A. Rogers]] in which the electrodes are arranged in a s-shape design to allow them to expand and bend without breaking. Although the device is only currently used as a research tool to study changes in heart rate, in the future the membrane may serve as a safeguard from heart attacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/3dprinted-electronic-glove-could-help-keep-your-heart-beating-for-ever-9166004.html|title=3D-printed 'electronic glove' could help keep your heart beating for ever|work=The Independent}}</ref>\n\n=== In the military ===\nMilitary organizations' research has recently focused on the utilization of [[Remote control animal|cyborg animals]] for the purposes of a supposed tactical advantage.

One major issue of space exploration is the biological need for oxygen. If this necessity was taken out of the equation, space exploration would be revolutionized. A theory proposed by Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline is aimed at tackling this problem. The two scientists theorized that the use of an inverse fuel cell that is \"capable of reducing CO2 to its components with removal of the carbon and re-circulation of the oxygen...\"<ref name=cyborgspace>[http://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/surf/022697surf-cyborg.html Cyborgs and Space], The New York Times</ref> could make breathing unnecessary.
