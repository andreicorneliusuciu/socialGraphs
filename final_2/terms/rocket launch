Launches for [[orbital spaceflight]]s, or launches into [[interplanetary space]], are usually from a fixed location on the ground, but may also be from a floating platform (such as the [[Sea Launch]] vessel) or, potentially, from a superheavy [[Antonov An-225 Mriya|An-225]]-class airplane<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.interfax.ru/russia/txt.asp?id=303221|script-title=ru:\u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u043e \"\u0412\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435\"|date=April 23, 2013|work=[[Interfax]]|accessdate=April 29, 2013|language=ru}}</ref>\n\nLaunches of [[suborbital flight]]s (including [[missile]] launches), can also be from:\n*a [[missile silo]]\n*a [[mobile launcher vehicle]]\n*a [[submarine]]\n*[[air launch]]:\n**from a plane (e.g. [[Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne]], [[Pegasus Rocket]], [[X-15]]\n**from a [[balloon]] ([[Rockoon]], [[da Vinci Project]] (under development))\n*a surface ship ([[Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System]])\n*an inclined rail (e.g. [[rocket sled launch]])\n\nLaunches not into space can also be from:\n*[[shoulder-launched missile weapon|the shoulder]]\n\nA [[skyrocket]] is launched from some stand.\n\n\"Rocket launch technologies\" generally refers to the entire set of systems needed to successfully launch a vehicle, not just the vehicle itself, but also the [[firing control system]]s, [[ground control station]], [[launch pad]], and [[tracking station]]s needed for a successful launch and/or recovery.\n\n== Commercial launches ==\n[[File:Galileo launch on Soyuz, 21 Oct 2011 (6266227357).jpg|right|thumb|Launch of [[Arianespace Soyuz]], a [[Three stage to orbit|three stage]] [[expendable launch system]], surrounded by water vapor from sublimating ice]]\n{{See also|Launch service provider}}\nCommercial launch service providers include:\n*[[Antrix Corporation]] ([[PSLV]]/[[GSLV]])\n*[[Arianespace]] ([[Ariane 5]]/[[Soyuz-2 (rocket)|Soyuz-2]]/[[Vega (rocket)|Vega]])\n*[[China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation]] ([[Long March rocket|Long March]])\n*[[Eurockot Launch Services]] ([[Rockot]])\n*[[International Launch Services]] ([[Proton-M]])\n*[[ISC Kosmotras]] ([[Dnepr (rocket)|Dnepr]])\n*[[Land Launch]] ([[Zenit (rocket)|Zenit-2SLB/Zenit-3SLB]])\n*[[Orbital ATK]] ([[Minotaur (rocket)|Minotaur]]/[[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus]]/[[Taurus (rocket)|Taurus]])\n*[[Sea Launch]] ([[Zenit-3SL]])\n*[[SpaceX]] ([[Falcon 1]]/[[Falcon 9]])\n*[[Starsem]] ([[Soyuz-FG]]/[[Soyuz-2 (rocket)|Soyuz-2]])\n*[[United Launch Alliance]] ([[Atlas V]]/[[Delta II]]/[[Delta IV]])\n\n== Launch vehicles ==\n{{main|launch vehicle}}\nIf a rocket is launched to deliver a [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] from a planetary surface into space it is called a [[launch vehicle]].\n\n<!-- can the remainder of this section be merged into to the launch vehicle article? -->\nThere are several broad categories that launch vehicles fall under, including:\n* [[Expendable launch system]]\n* [[Reusable launch system]]\n* [[Single stage to orbit]]\n* [[Two stage to orbit]]\n* [[Three stage to orbit]]\n\nFor the launch vehicles currently in use for [[human spaceflight]], see that article.\n\nThere were over 70 orbital launches in 2010.\n\n==Orbital launches==\n[[File:ISRO PSLV dogleg maneuver.jpg|thumb|ISRO PSLV C20 SARAL mission dogleg maneuver]]\nOrbital launch vehicles commonly take off vertically, and then begin to progressively lean over, usually following a [[gravity turn]] trajectory.\n\nOnce above the majority of the atmosphere, the vehicle then angles the rocket jet, pointing it largely horizontally but somewhat downwards, which permits the vehicle to gain and then maintain altitude while increasing horizontal speed. As the speed grows, the vehicle will become more and more horizontal until at orbital speed, the engine will cut off.\n\nAll current vehicles will ''stage''-jettison hardware on the way to orbit.\n\nWhen launching a spacecraft to orbit, a \"dogleg\" is a guided, powered turn during ascent phase that causes a rocket's flight path to deviate from a \"straight\" path. A dogleg is necessary if the desired launch azimuth, to reach a desired orbital inclination, would take the [[ground track]] over land (or over a populated area, e.g. Russia usually does launch over land, but over unpopulated areas), or if the rocket is trying to reach an orbital plane that does not reach the [[latitude]] of the launch site. Doglegs are undesirable due to extra onboard fuel required, causing heavier load, and a reduction of vehicle performance.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Spacecraft propulsion#Launch mechanisms|Launch mechanisms]]\n*[[Gravity drag]]\n*[[Non-rocket spacelaunch]]\n*[[List of rockets]]\n*[[Orbital spaceflight]]\n*[[Sub-orbital spaceflight]]\n*[[Spaceport]]\n*[[List of rocket launch sites]]\n* [[Launch status check]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.zarya.info/Calendar.php Calendar of Current and Upcoming Launches]\n*[http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/launches/launch_schedule.html Scheduled and past launches, in principle all from 1999]\n\n{{Types of take-off and landing}}\n\n[[Category:Space launch vehicles]]\n[[Category:Rocketry|Launch]]\n[[Category:Flight phases]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n\n[[fi:Kantoraketti]]"}]}}}}
