Davies ''Protection of industrial power systems second edition'', Butterworth-Heinemann, 1996 ISBN 0-7506-2662-3 page 55</ref> The device has at least four terminals: a terminal for connection to the high voltage signal, a ground terminal, and two secondary terminals which connect to the instrumentation or protective relay.\n\nIn practice, capacitor C<sub>1</sub> is often constructed as a stack of smaller capacitors connected in series. This provides a large voltage drop across C<sub>1</sub> and a relatively small voltage drop across C<sub>2</sub>. As the majority of the voltage drop is on C<sub>1</sub>, this reduces the required insulation level of the voltage transformer. This makes CVTs more economical than the wound voltage transformers under high voltage (over 100kV), as the latter one requires more winding and materials.\n\n \"Capacitive voltage transformers exist and are used by utilities for high-voltage (greater than 66 kV) metering. They have a capacitive voltage divider but also have a dual-winding transformer to couple the divided voltage to the metering circuit. They tend to have lower allowable burdens than a wound transformer but can be made economically at higher voltage ratings. Another difference is that even though they decrease voltage, they do not increase current as found in wound electromagnetic transformers - an ampere drawn by the load is an ampere drawn from the primary circuit. And of course they can only reduce voltage, not increase\" \n\nThe above is a part of a Wikipedia write-up. I might sum up the definition of a capacotor voltage transformer as a step down transformer with a convenient node of a series-connected capacitor network connected in series with the primary winding. The free end of the capacitor and the free end of the transormer primary constitute the primary terminals. \nThis device is presently used as a potential transformer to monitor high voltages. \nOf course ordinary step down transformer does not employ series capacitor in the primary.\n\n==CVT Voltage Frequency Response==\nWith the rated load at the voltage transformer secondary side, The output voltage of CVT initially decrease a little bit, then reaches the resonance peak at around 800 Hz. Then it decreases drastically and remains almost level out after 2000hz.\n.\n\n==CVT Current Frequency Response==\nThe C<sub>2</sub> current is linear with frequency. The frequency response for voltage transformer current has a resonance peak at around 800&nbsp;Hz. C<sub>2</sub> current is substantially larger than voltage transformer current.\n\n==Bus Voltage Representation of CVT==\nThe bus voltage in frequency domain can be calculated by summing the voltages on  C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>. \nFrom the calculation result it can be seen that the bus voltage only relates to C<sub>2</sub> current, voltage transformer current and their ratios.This result is helpful to reconstruct the bus voltage with the C<sub>2</sub> current, voltage transformer current. For the ratio, it can be achieved by using a summing amplifier.\n\n==Other Applications==\nThe CVT is also useful in communication systems. CVTs in combination with wave traps are used for filtering high-frequency communication signals from power frequency.<ref>Stanley H. Horowitz, Arun G.
