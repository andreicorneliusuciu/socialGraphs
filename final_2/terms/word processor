Later models introduced innovations such as [[spell-checking]] programs, and improved formatting options.\n\nAs the more versatile combination of [[personal computer]]s and [[Computer printer|printers]] became commonplace, and computer software applications for word processing became popular, most business machine companies stopped manufacturing dedicated word processor machines. As of 2009 there were only two U.S. companies, Classic and [[AlphaSmart]], which still made them.<ref>Mark Newhall, ''Farm Show''</ref>{{datedinfo|2016|7}} Many older machines, however, remain in use. Since 2009, Sentinel has offered a machine described as a \"word processor\", but it is more accurately a highly specialised microcomputer used for accounting and publishing.<ref>StarLux Illumination catalog</ref>\n\nWord processing was one of the earliest applications for the [[personal computer]] in office productivity, and was the most widely used application on personal computers until the [[World Wide Web]] rose to prominence in the mid-1990s.\n\nAlthough the early word processors evolved to use tag-based [[Markup language|markup]] for document formatting, most modern word processors take advantage of a [[graphical user interface]] providing some form of [[what-you-see-is-what-you-get]] (\"WYSIWYG\") editing. Most are powerful systems consisting of one or more programs that can produce a combination of [[image]]s, [[graphics]] and text, the latter handled with [[type-setting]] capability. Typical features of a modern word processor include: multiple font sets, spell checking, grammar checking, a built-in thesaurus, [[autocorrection|automatic text correction]], Web integration, HTML conversion, pre-formatted publication projects such as newsletters and to-do lists, and much more. In its simplest form, a word processor is like an [[Expensive Typewriter]] or [[Typewriter]] machine, with the improvement of being able to proofread, and correct mistakes  before [[Printer (computing)|printing]].\n\n[[Microsoft Word]] is the most widely used word processing software according to a user tracking system built into the software.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Microsoft estimates that roughly half a billion people use the [[Microsoft Office]] suite,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2009/jan09/01-08cesofficeqaschultz.mspx |title=Microsoft Office Is Right at Home |date=January 8, 2009 |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}</ref> which includes Word. Many other word processing applications exist, including [[WordPerfect]] (which dominated the market from the mid-1980s to early-1990s on computers running Microsoft's [[MS-DOS]] [[operating system]], and still (2014) is favored for legal applications) and [[open source]] applications [[OpenOffice.org Writer]], [[LibreOffice Writer]], [[AbiWord]], [[KWord]], and [[LyX]]. Web-based word processors, such as [[Office Online]] , [[Google Docs]] , [http://www.zoho.com/writer Zoho Writer] or [http://www.quip.com Quip] are a relatively new category.\n\n==Characteristics==\nWord processors evolved dramatically once they became software programs rather than dedicated machines. They can usefully be distinguished from [[text editor]]s, the category of software they evolved from.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gzAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA19&lpg=PA19|title=InfoWorld Jan 1 1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JTYPKxug49IC&pg=PA256&lpg=PA256|title=Milestones in Computer Science and Information Technology}}</ref>\n\nA text editor is a program that is used for typing, copying, pasting, and printing text (a single character, or strings of characters). Text editors do not format lines or pages. (There are extensions of text editors which can perform formatting of lines and pages: batch document processing systems, starting with [[TJ-2]] and [[RUNOFF]] and still available in such systems as [[LaTeX]], as well as programs that implement the paged-media extensions to [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]). Text editors are now used mainly by [[programmer]]s, website designers, computer system administrators, and, in the case of [[LaTeX]], by mathematicians and scientists (for complex formulas and for citations in rare languages). They are also useful when fast startup times, small file sizes, editing speed, and simplicity of operation are valued, and when formatting is unimportant. Due to their use in managing complex software projects, text editors can sometimes provide better facilities for managing large writing projects than a word processor.<ref>{{cite book|title=UNIX Text Processing, O'Reilly|quote=Nonetheless, the text editors used in program development environments can provide much better facilities for managing large writing projects than their office word-processing counterparts.}}</ref>\n\nWord processing added to the text editor the ability to control type style and size, to manage lines (word wrap), to format documents into pages, and to number pages. Functions now taken for granted were added incrementally, sometimes by purchase of independent providers of add-on programs. Spell checking, grammar checking and [[mail merge]] were some of the most popular add-ons for early word processors. Word processors are also capable of hyphenation, and the management and correct positioning of footnotes and endnotes.\n\nMore advanced features found in recent word processors include:\n* Collaborative editing, allowing multiple users to work on the same document.\n* [[Index (publishing)|Indexing]] assistance. (True indexing, as performed by a professional human indexer, is far beyond current technology, for the same reasons that fully automated, literary-quality machine translation is.)\n* Creation of tables of contents.\n* Management, editing, and positioning of visual material (illustrations, diagrams), and sometimes sound files.\n* Automatically managed (updated) cross-references to pages or notes.\n* Version control of a document, permitting reconstruction of its evolution.\n* Non-printing comments and annotations.\n* Generation of document statistics (characters, words, readability level, time spent editing by each user).\n* \"Styles\", which automate consistent formatting of text body, titles, subtitles, highlighted text, and so on.\n\nLater [[desktop publishing]] programs were specifically designed with elaborate pre-formatted layouts for publication, offering only limited options for changing the layout, while allowing users to import text that was written using a text editor or word processor, or type the text in themselves.\n\n==Typical usage==\nWord processors have a variety of uses and applications within the business world, home, education, journalism, publishing, and the literary arts.\n\n===Business===\nWithin the business world, word processors are extremely useful tools. Some typical uses include: creating legal documents, company reports, publications for clients, [[letter (message)|letter]]s, and internal [[memorandum|memo]]s. Businesses tend to have their own format and style for any of these, and additions such as company [[letterhead]]. Thus, modern word processors with layout editing and similar capabilities find widespread use in most business.\n\n===Home===\nWhile many homes have word processors on their computers, word processing in the home tends to be educational, planning or business related, dealing with school assignments or work being completed at home. Occasionally word processors are used for recreational purposes, e.g. writing short stories, [[poem]]s or personal correspondence. Some use word processors to create [[r\u00e9sum\u00e9]]s and [[greeting card]]s, but many of these home publishing processes have been taken over by [[web app]]s or desktop publishing programs specifically oriented toward home uses. The rise of [[email]] and [[social network]]s has also reduced the home role of the word processor as uses that formerly required printed output can now be done entirely [[online]].\n\n===Literature===\nNovelists, poets, playwrights, screenwriters, and essayists naturally gravitated toward word processing once the technology became widely available. Notable early adopters in the mid- or late-1970s included science fiction author (and [[BYTE Magazine]] columnist) [[Jerry Pournelle]], [[Larry Niven]], [[Stanley Elkin]], [[James Fallows]], and [[Michael Crichton]].<ref name=kb>{{Cite book|title=Track changes: a literary history of word processing|last=Kirschenbaum|first=Matthew G.|publisher=Belnap|year=2016|isbn=9780674417076|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}</ref> The first novel generally credited as having been written on a word processor is [[Len Deighton]]'s ''[[Bomber (novel)|Bomber]]'', which was composed on an [[IBM MT/ST]] in London in 1968-9; Deighton's typist and assistant, Ellenor Handley, was the person to actually operate the machine.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2013/03/len_deighton_s_bomber_the_first_book_ever_written_on_a_word_processor.single.html | title=The Book-Writing Machine: What was the first novel ever written on a word processor? | work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date=1 March 2013 | accessdate=2 March 2013 | author=Kirschenbaum, Matthew}}</ref><ref name=kb /> However, other contenders for the position are John Hershey, who edited his book ''Hiroshima'' in the seventies on a mainframe at Yale, and Jerry Pournelle, who may have been the first to compose on a machine with a screen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/06/how-to-write-a-history-of-writing-software/489173/|title=How to Write a History of Writing Software|last=Meyer|first=Robinson|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-09}}</ref> Some writers such as [[Cory Doctorow]] and [[Neal Stephenson]] prefer [[text editor]]s to word processors.\n\n==History==\nWord processors are descended from the [[Friden Flexowriter]], which had two punched tape stations and permitted switching from one to the other (thus enabling what was called the \"chain\" or \"form letter\", one tape containing names and addresses, and the other the body of the letter to be sent). It did not wrap words, which was begun by IBM's [[IBM MT/ST|Magnetic Tape Selectric Typewriter]] (later, Magnetic Card Selectric Typewriter).\n\n===IBM Selectric===\n[[File:Astrotype.jpg|thumb|A 4-user Astrotype system using a DEC PDP minicomputer and IBM Selectric terminals.]]\nThe [[IBM Selectric]] typewriter was a highly successful model line of electric typewriters introduced in 1961. [[Expensive Typewriter]] written and improved between 1961 and 1962 by Steve Piner and L. Peter Deutsch, was a text editing program that ran on a DEC [[PDP-1]] computer at [[MIT]]. Since it could drive an IBM Selectric typewriter (a letter-quality printer), it may be considered the first word processing program, but the term ''word processing'' itself was only introduced, by [[IBM]]'s [[B\u00f6blingen]] Laboratory in the late 1960s.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIn 1969, two software based text editing products (Astrotype and Astrocomp) were developed and marketed by [[Information Control Systems]] ([[Ann Arbor]] Michigan).<ref>http://oldnews.aadl.org/taxonomy/term/35262</ref><ref name=\"Special Purpose Systems\">{{cite news|title=Secretaries Get a Computer of their Own to Automate Typing|url=http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/computersAndAutomation/196901.pdf|accessdate=10 September 2013|newspaper=Computers and Automation|date=January 1969 |page=59}}</ref><ref name=\"Word Processing Circa 1968\">{{cite news|title=Computer Aided Typists Produce Perfect Copies|url=http://technologizer.com/2009/08/21/word-processing-circa-1968/|accessdate=10 September 2013|newspaper=Computer World|date=November 13, 1968}}</ref>  Both products used the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] [[PDP-8]] mini computer, [[DECtape]] (4\u201d reel) randomly accessible tape drives, and a modified version of the [[IBM Selectric typewriter]] (the [[IBM 2741]] Terminal). These 1969 products preceded CRT display-based word processors.  Text editing was done using a line numbering system viewed on a paper copy inserted in the Selectric typewriter.\n\nBy 1971 word processing was recognized by the ''New York Times'' as a \"[[buzz word]]\".<ref name=buzz>{{cite news |last=Smith |first=William D. |title=Lag Persists for Business Equipment |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 26, 1971 |page=59 |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30F10F73D5E127A93C4AB178BD95F458785F9 }}</ref> A 1974 ''Times'' article referred to \"the brave new world of Word Processing or W/P.

Written by Gerald M. Berns, FORMAT was described in his paper \"Description of FORMAT, a Text-Processing Program\" (Communications of the ACM, Volume 12, Number 3, March, 1969) as \"a production program which facilitates the editing and printing of 'finished' documents directly on the printer of a relatively small (64k) computer system. It features good performance, totally free-form input, very flexible formatting capabilities including up to eight columns per page, automatic capitalization, aids for index construction, and a minimum of nontext [control elements] items.\" Input was normally on punched cards or magnetic tape, with up to 80capital letters and non-alphabetic characters per card. The limited typographical controls available were implemented by control sequences; for example, letters were automatically converted to lower case unless they followed a full stop, that is, the \"period\" character. Output could be printed on a typical line printer in all-capitals \u2014 or in upper and lower case using a special (\"TN\") printer chain \u2014 or could be punched as a paper tape which could be printed, in better than line printer quality, on a Flexowriter. A workalike program with some improvements, DORMAT, was developed and used at [[University College London]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nElectromechanical [[Punched tape|paper-tape-based]] equipment such as the [[Friden Flexowriter]] had long been available; the Flexowriter allowed for operations such as repetitive typing of [[form letter]]s (with a pause for the operator to manually type in the variable information),<ref>{{cite news |last=O'Kane |first=Lawrence |title=Computer a Help to 'Friendly Doc'; Automated Letter Writer Can Dispense a Cheery Word |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 22, 1966 |page=348 |quote=Automated cordiality will be one of the services offered to physicians and dentists who take space in a new medical center....

Circa 1970 it began to be feasible to apply electronic computers to office automation tasks. IBM's Mag Tape Selectric Typewriter ([[IBM MT/ST|MT/ST]]) and later Mag Card Selectric (MCST) were early devices of this kind, which allowed editing, simple revision, and repetitive typing, with a one-line display for editing single lines.<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Rostky\n| first = Georgy\n| year = 2000\n| url = http://www.eetimes.com/special/special_issues/millennium/milestones/berezin.html\n| title = The word processor: cumbersome, but great\n| publisher = EETimes\n| accessdate = 2006-05-29\n}}</ref> The first novel to be written on a word processor, the IBM MT/ST, was [[Len Deighton]]'s ''[[Bomber (novel)|Bomber]]'', published in 1970.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2013/03/len_deighton_s_bomber_the_first_book_ever_written_on_a_word_processor.single.html | title=The Book-Writing Machine: What was the first novel ever written on a word processor? | work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date=March 1, 2013 | accessdate=March 2, 2013 | author=Kirschenbaum, Matthew}}</ref>\n\n===Effect on office administration===\nThe New York Times, reporting on a 1971 business equipment trade show, said\n:The \"buzz word\" for this year's show was \"word processing,\" or the use of electronic equipment, such as typewriters; procedures and trained personnel to maximize office efficiency.<!--Slightly garbled-looking sentence is as published by the NYT--> At the IBM exhibition a girl typed on an electronic typewriter.

Word processing will replace the 'traditional' secretary and give women new administrative roles in business and industry.\"<!--Quote marks as shown in article; no source mentioned.--><ref name=\"buzz\"/>\n\nThe 1970s word processing concept did not refer merely to equipment, but, explicitly, to the use of equipment for \"breaking down secretarial labor into distinct components, with some staff members handling typing exclusively while others supply administrative support.

The real breakthrough by Dorsey\u2019s AES team was that their machine stored the operator\u2019s texts on magnetic disks. Texts could be retrieved from the disks simply by entering their names at the keyboard. More importantly, a text could be edited, for instance a paragraph moved to a new place, or a spelling error corrected, and these changes were recorded on the magnetic disk.\n\nThe AES machine was actually a sophisticated computer, that could be reprogrammed by changing the instructions contained within a few chips.<ref name=\"Thomas 1983, p. 94\">{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=David |title=Knights of the New Technology |location=Toronto |publisher=Key Porter Books |year=1983 |page=94 |isbn=0-919493-16-5 }}</ref><ref name=\"archives.cbc.ca\">CBC Television, Venture, \"AES: A Canadian Cautionary Tale\" http://archives.cbc.ca/economy_business/business/clips/14928/ .

The Micom 2000 improved on the AES design by using the Intel 8080 single-chip microprocessor, which made the word processor smaller, less costly to build and supported multiple languages.<ref>Thomas, David \"Knights of the New Technology\". Key Porter Books, 1983, p. 97 & p. 98.</ref>\n\nAround this time, DeltaData and Wang word processors also appeared, again with a video screen and a magnetic storage disk.\n\nThe competitive edge for Dorsey's Micom 2000 was that, unlike many other machines, it was truly programmable. The Micom machine countered the problem of obsolescence by avoiding the limitations of a hard-wired system of program storage. The Micom 2000 utilized RAM, which was mass-produced and totally programmable.<ref>\u201cWill success spoil Steve Dorsey?\u201d, Industrial Management magazine, Clifford/Elliot & Associates, May 1979, pp. 8 & 9.</ref> The Micom 2000 was said to be a year ahead of its time when it was introduced into a marketplace that represented some pretty serious competition such as IBM, Xerox and [[Wang Laboratories]].<ref>\u201cWill success spoil Steve Dorsey?\u201d, Industrial Management magazine, Clifford/Elliot & Associates, May 1979, p. 7.</ref>\n\nIn 1978, Micom partnered with Dutch multinational [[Philips]] and Dorsey grew Micom's sales position to number three among major word processor manufacturers, behind only IBM and Wang.<ref>Thomas, David \"Knights of the New Technology\".

One of his programs permitted a Wang calculator to interface with an [[IBM Selectric]] typewriter, which was at the time used to calculate and print the paperwork for auto sales.\n\nIn 1974, Koplow's interface program was developed into the Wang 1200 Word Processor, an IBM Selectric-based text-storage device. The operator of this machine typed text on a conventional IBM Selectric; when the Return key was pressed, the line of text was stored on a cassette tape. One cassette held roughly 20 pages of text, and could be \"played back\" (i.e., the text retrieved) by printing the contents on continuous-form paper in the 1200 typewriter's \"print\" mode. The stored text could also be edited, using keys on a simple, six-key array. Basic editing functions included Insert, Delete, Skip (character, line), and so on.\n\nThe labor and cost savings of this device were immediate, and remarkable: pages of text no longer had to be retyped to correct simple errors, and projects could be worked on, stored, and then retrieved for use later on. The rudimentary Wang 1200 machine was the precursor of the Wang Office Information System (OIS), introduced in 1976. It was a true office machine, affordable by organizations such as medium-sized law firms, and easily learned and operated by secretarial staff.\n\nThe Wang was not the first CRT-based machine nor were all of its innovations unique to Wang. In the early 1970s Linolex, Lexitron and Vydec introduced pioneering word-processing systems with [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] [[computer display|display]] editing. A Canadian electronics company, Automatic Electronic Systems, had introduced a product in 1972, but went into receivership a year later. In 1976, refinanced by the [[Canada Development Corporation]], it returned to operation as [[AES Data]], and went on to successfully market its brand of word processors worldwide until its demise in the mid-1980s.

Cheap general-purpose computers were still the domain of hobbyists.\n\nSome of the earliest CRT-based machines used cassette tapes for removable-memory storage until [[floppy diskette]]s became available for this purpose - first the 8-inch floppy, then the 5\u00bc-inch (drives by [[Shugart Associates]] and diskettes by [[Dysan]]).\n\nPrinting of documents was initially accomplished using IBM Selectric typewriters modified for [[ASCII]]-character input. These were later replaced by application-specific [[daisy wheel printer]]s, first developed by [[Diablo Data Systems|Diablo]], which became a Xerox company, and later by [[Qume]]. For quicker \"draft\" printing, dot-matrix line printers were optional alternatives with some word processors.\n\n===WYSIWYG models===\n[[File:Office Products output samples 1980-81.png|right|thumb|Examples of standalone word processor typefaces c.&nbsp;1980\u20131981]]\n[[File:Hardwarewordprocessor.png|thumb|Brother WP-1400D editing electronic typewriter (1994)]]\n\n[[Electric Pencil]], released in December 1976, was the first word processor software for microcomputers.<ref name=\"pea1987\">{{cite journal | jstor=1167314 | title=Cognitive Technologies for Writing | author=Pea, Roy D. and D.

Some programs were modeled after particular dedicated WP hardware. [[MultiMate]], for example, was written for an insurance company that had hundreds of typists using Wang systems, and spread from there to other Wang customers. To adapt to the smaller, more generic PC keyboard, MultiMate used stick-on labels and a large plastic clip-on template to remind users of its dozens of Wang-like functions, using the shift, alt and [[Control key|ctrl]] keys with the 10 IBM function keys and many of the alphabet keys.\n\nOther early word-processing software required users to memorize semi-mnemonic key combinations rather than pressing keys labelled \"copy\" or \"bold\". (In fact, many early PCs lacked cursor keys; [[WordStar]] famously used the E-S-D-X-centered \"diamond\" for cursor navigation, and modern vi-like editors encourage use of [[hjkl]] for navigation.) However, the price differences between dedicated word processors and general-purpose PCs, and the value added to the latter by software such as [[VisiCalc]], were so compelling that personal computers and word processing software soon became serious competition for the dedicated machines. Word processing became the most popular use for personal computers, and unlike the spreadsheet (dominated by [[Lotus 1-2-3]]) and database ([[dBase]]) markets, [[WordPerfect]], [[XyWrite]], [[Microsoft Word]], [[pfs:Write]], and dozens of other word processing software brands competed in the 1980s; ''[[PC Magazine]]'' reviewed 57 different programs in one January 1986 issue.{{r|bergin2006}} Development of higher-resolution monitors allowed them to provide limited [[WYSIWYG]]\u2014What You See Is What You Get, to the extent that typographical features like bold and italics, indentation, justification and margins were approximated on screen.\n\nThe mid-to-late 1980s saw the spread of laser printers, a \"typographic\" approach to word processing, and of true WYSIWYG [[bitmap]] displays with multiple fonts (pioneered by the [[Xerox Alto]] computer and [[Bravo (software)|Bravo]] word processing program), [[PostScript]], and [[graphical user interface]]s (another [[Xerox PARC]] innovation, with the [[Gypsy (software)|Gypsy]] word processor which was commercialised in the [[Xerox Star]] product range). Standalone word processors adapted by getting smaller and replacing their CRTs with small character-oriented LCD displays. Some models also had computer-like features such as [[floppy disk drive]]s and the ability to output to an external printer. They also got a name change, now being called \"electronic typewriters\" and typically occupying a lower end of the market, selling for under $200 USD.\n\nDuring the late 1980s and into the 1990s the predominant word processing program was WordPerfect<ref name=\"Word processor\">{{cite web |last=Eisenberg |first=Daniel |title=Word Processing (History Of) |url=http://users.ipfw.edu/jehle/deisenbe/compartics/History_of_Word_Processing.pdf|work=Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science |others=Vol. 49 |location=New York |publisher=Dekker |year=1992 |pages=268\u201378 |accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[MacWrite]], [[Microsoft Word]] and other word processing programs for the bit-mapped Apple Macintosh screen, introduced in 1984, were probably the first true WYSIWYG word processors to become known to many people until the introduction of Microsoft Windows. Dedicated word processors eventually became museum pieces.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Amstrad PCW]]\n* [[Authoring systems]]\n* [[Canon Cat]]\n* [[Comparison of word processors]]\n* [[Content management system]]\n* [[CPT Word Processors]]\n* [[Document collaboration]]\n* [[List of word processors]]\n* [[IBM MT/ST]]\n* [[Office suite]]\n* [[TeX]]\n* [[Typography]]\n* [[Microwriter]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Literature == \n* Matthew G.
