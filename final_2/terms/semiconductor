Their resistance decreases as their temperature increases, which is behavior opposite to that of a metal. Finally, their conducting properties may be altered in useful ways by the deliberate, controlled introduction of impurities (\"[[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]]\") into the crystal structure, which lowers its resistance but also permits the creation of [[semiconductor junction]]s between differently-doped regions of the [[extrinsic semiconductor]] crystal. The behavior of [[charge carrier]]s which include [[electron]]s, [[ion]]s and [[electron hole]]s at these junctions is the basis of [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s and all modern electronics.\n\n[[Semiconductor device]]s can display a range of useful properties such as passing current more easily in one direction than the other, showing variable resistance, and sensitivity to light or heat. Because the electrical properties of a semiconductor material can be modified by doping, or by the application of electrical fields or light, devices made from semiconductors can be used for amplification, switching, and energy conversion.\n\nThe modern understanding of the properties of a semiconductor relies on [[quantum physics]] to explain the movement of charge carriers in a [[Crystal structure|crystal lattice]].<ref name=Feynman>{{cite book|last1=Feynman|first1=Richard|title=Feynman Lectures on Physics|date=1963|publisher=Basic Books}}</ref>  Doping greatly increases the number of charge carriers within the crystal. When a doped semiconductor contains mostly free holes it is called \"[[Extrinsic semiconductor#P-type semiconductors|p-type]]\", and when it contains mostly free electrons it is known as \"[[Extrinsic semiconductor#N-type semiconductors|n-type]]\". The semiconductor materials used in electronic devices are doped under precise conditions to control the concentration and regions of p- and n-type dopants. A single semiconductor crystal can have many p- and n-type regions; the [[p-n junction|p\u2013n junctions]] between these regions are responsible for the useful electronic behavior.\n\nAlthough some pure elements and many compounds display semiconductor properties, [[silicon]], [[germanium]], and compounds of [[gallium]] are the most widely used in electronic devices. Elements near the so-called \"[[metalloid]] staircase\", where the metalloids are located on the periodic table, are usually used as semiconductors.\n\nSome of the properties of semiconductor materials were observed throughout the mid 19th and first decades of the 20th century. The first practical application of semiconductors in electronics was the 1904 development of the [[Cat's-whisker detector]], a primitive semiconductor diode widely used in early radio receivers. Developments in quantum physics in turn allowed the development of the [[transistor]] in 1947<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shockley|first1=William|title=Electrons and holes in semiconductors : with applications to transistor electronics|date=1950|publisher=R.

There are several developed techniques that allow semiconducting materials to behave like conducting materials, such as [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] or [[field effect (semiconductor)|gating]]. These modifications have two outcomes: n-type and p-type. These refer to the excess or shortage of electrons, respectively. An unbalanced number of electrons would cause a current to flow through the material.<ref name=Neamen>{{cite web|last1=Neamen|first1=Donald|title=Semiconductor Physics and Devices|url=http://www.fulviofrisone.com/attachments/article/403/Semiconductor%20Physics%20And%20Devices%20-%20Donald%20Neamen.pdf|publisher=Elizabeth A. Jones}}</ref>\n;[[Heterojunctions]]\n:Heterojunctions occur when two differently doped semiconducting materials are joined together. For example, a configuration could consist of p-doped and n-doped [[germanium]]. This results in an exchange of electrons and holes between the differently doped semiconducting materials. The n-doped germanium would have an excess of electrons, and the p-doped germanium would have an excess of holes. The transfer occurs until equilibrium is reached by a process called [[recombination (physics)|recombination]], which causes the migrating electrons from the n-type to come in contact with the migrating holes from the p-type. A product of this process is charged [[ion]]s, which result in an [[electric field]].<ref name=Feynman /><ref name=Neamen />\n;Excited Electrons\n:A difference in electric potential on a semiconducting material would cause it to leave thermal equilibrium and create a non-equilibrium situation. This introduces electrons and holes to the system, which interact via a process called [[ambipolar diffusion]]. Whenever thermal equilibrium is disturbed in a semiconducting material, the amount of holes and electrons changes. Such disruptions can occur as a result of a temperature difference or [[photon]]s, which can enter the system and create electrons and holes. The process that creates and annihilates electrons and holes are called [[Carrier generation and recombination|generation]] and [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombination]].<ref name=Neamen />\n;Light emission\n:In certain semiconductors, excited electrons can relax by emitting light instead of producing heat.<ref>By Abdul Al-Azzawi. \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=Iw7NBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=In+certain+semiconductors,+excited+electrons+can+relax+by+emitting+light+instead+of+producing+heat.%5C&source=bl&ots=W0PTjQvQ2L&sig=ukjN-RIXvTMjjbhYd9QRxK14sd4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjMncyJmqjLAhVBxWMKHWuiBy0Q6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&q&f=false Light and Optics: Principles and Practices].\" 2007.

Yacobi, ''Semiconductor Materials: An Introduction to Basic Principles'', Springer 2003 ISBN 0-306-47361-5, pp. 1\u20133</ref>\n* Certain pure elements are found in [[Group 14 elements|Group 14]] of the [[periodic table]]; the most commercially important of these elements are [[silicon]] and [[germanium]]. Silicon and germanium are used here effectively because they have 4 valence electrons in their outermost shell which gives them the ability to gain or lose electrons equally at the same time.\n* Binary compounds, particularly between elements in Groups 13 and 15, such as [[gallium arsenide]], Groups 12 and 16, groups 14 and 16, and between different group 14 elements, e.g. [[silicon carbide]].\n* Certain ternary compounds, oxides and alloys.\n* [[Organic semiconductor]]s, made of [[organic compound]]s.\n\nMost common semiconducting materials are crystalline solids, but amorphous and liquid semiconductors are also known. These include [[hydrogenated amorphous silicon]] and mixtures of [[arsenic]], [[selenium]] and [[tellurium]] in a variety of proportions. These compounds share with better known semiconductors the properties of intermediate conductivity and a rapid variation of conductivity with temperature, as well as occasional [[negative resistance]]. Such disordered materials lack the rigid crystalline structure of conventional semiconductors such as silicon. They are generally used in [[thin film]] structures, which do not require material of higher electronic quality, being relatively insensitive to impurities and radiation damage.\n\n===Preparation of semiconductor materials===\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}\n\nAlmost all of today's electronic technology involves the use of semiconductors, with the most important aspect being the [[integrated circuit]] (IC). Some examples of devices that contain integrated circuits includes [[Laptop computer|laptop]]s, scanners, [[cell-phone]]s, etc. Semiconductors for ICs are mass-produced. To create an ideal semiconducting material, chemical purity is paramount. Any small imperfection can have a drastic effect on how the semiconducting material behaves due to the scale at which the materials are used.<ref name=Neamen />\n\nA high degree of crystalline perfection is also required, since faults in crystal structure (such as [[dislocation]]s, [[Crystal twinning|twins]], and [[Crystallographic defect#Planar defects|stacking faults]]) interfere with the semiconducting properties of the material. Crystalline faults are a major cause of defective semiconductor devices. The larger the crystal, the more difficult it is to achieve the necessary perfection. Current mass production processes use crystal [[ingot]]s between 100 and 300&nbsp;mm (4 and 12 in) in diameter which are grown as cylinders and sliced into [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]].\n\nThere is a combination of processes that is used to prepare semiconducting materials for ICs. One process is called [[thermal oxidation]], which forms [[silicon dioxide]] on the surface of the [[silicon]]. This is used as a [[gate dielectric|gate insulator]] and [[LOCOS|field oxide]]. Other processes are called [[photomask]]s and [[photolithography]]. This process is what creates the patterns on the circuity in the integrated circuit. [[Ultraviolet light]] is used along with a [[photoresist]] layer to create a chemical change that generates the patterns for the circuit.<ref name=Neamen />\n\nEtching is the next process that is required. The part of the silicon that was not covered by the [[photoresist]] layer from the previous step can now be etched. The main process typically used today is called [[plasma etching]]. Plasma etching usually involves an [[plasma etching|etch gas]] pumped in a low-pressure chamber to create [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. A common etch gas is [[chlorofluorocarbon]], or more commonly known [[Freon]]. A high [[radio-frequency]] [[voltage]] between the [[cathode]] and [[anode]] is what creates the plasma in the chamber. The [[wafer (electronics)|silicon wafer]] is located on the cathode, which causes it to be hit by the positively charged ions that are released from the plasma. The end result is silicon that is etched [[anisotropy|anisotropically]].<ref name=Feynman /><ref name=Neamen />\n\nThe last process is called [[doping (semiconductor)|diffusion]]. This is the process that gives the semiconducting material its desired semiconducting properties. It is also known as [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]]. The process introduces an impure atom to the system, which creates the [[p-n junction]]. In order to get the impure atoms embedded in the silicon wafer, the wafer is first put in a 1100 degree Celsius chamber. The atoms are injected in and eventually diffuse with the silicon. After the process is completed and the silicon has reached room temperature, the doping process is done and the semiconducting material is ready to be used in an integrated circuit.<ref name=Feynman /><ref name=Neamen />\n\n==Physics of semiconductors==\n\n===Energy bands and electrical conduction===\n\n{{main article|Electronic band structure|Electrical conduction}}\n\n{{Band structure filling diagram}}\n\nSemiconductors are defined by their unique electric conductive behavior, somewhere between that of a metal and an insulator.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Fundamentals of Semiconductors|last = Yu|first = Peter|publisher = Springer-Verlag|year = 2010|isbn = 978-3-642-00709-5|location = Berlin|pages = }}</ref>\nThe differences between these materials can be understood in terms of the [[quantum state]]s for electrons, each of which may contain zero or one electron (by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]). These states are associated with the [[electronic band structure]] of the material.\n[[Electrical conductivity]] arises due to the presence of electrons in states that are [[delocalized electron|delocalized]] (extending through the material), however in order to transport electrons a state must be ''partially filled'', containing an electron only part of the time.<ref>As in the Mott formula for conductivity, see {{Cite journal | last1 = Cutler | first1 = M. | last2 = Mott | first2 = N. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.181.1336 | title = Observation of Anderson Localization in an Electron Gas | journal = Physical Review | volume = 181 | issue = 3 | pages = 1336 | year = 1969 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1969PhRv..181.1336C }}</ref> If the state is always occupied with an electron, then it is inert, blocking the passage of other electrons via that state.\nThe energies of these quantum states are critical, since a state is partially filled only if its energy is near the [[Fermi level]] (see [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]]).\n\nHigh conductivity in a material comes from it having many partially filled states and much state delocalization.\nMetals are good [[electrical conductor]]s and have many partially filled states with energies near their Fermi level.\n[[Insulator (electricity)|Insulators]], by contrast, have few partially filled states, their Fermi levels sit within [[band gap]]s with few energy states to occupy.\nImportantly, an insulator can be made to conduct by increasing its temperature: heating provides energy to promote some electrons across the band gap, inducing partially filled states in both the band of states beneath the band gap ([[valence band]]) and the band of states above the band gap ([[conduction band]]).\nAn (intrinsic) semiconductor has a band gap that is smaller than that of an insulator and at room temperature significant numbers of electrons can be excited to cross the band gap.<ref name=\"Kittel\">[[Charles Kittel]] (1995) ''Introduction to Solid State Physics'', 7th ed. Wiley, ISBN 0-471-11181-3.</ref>\n\nA pure semiconductor, however, is not very useful, as it is neither a very good insulator nor a very good conductor.\nHowever, one important feature of semiconductors (and some insulators, known as ''semi-insulators'') is that their conductivity can be increased and controlled by [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] with impurities and [[field effect (semiconductor)|gating]] with electric fields. Doping and gating move either the conduction or valence band much closer to the Fermi level, and greatly increase the number of partially filled states.\n\nSome wider-[[band gap]] semiconductor materials are sometimes referred to as '''semi-insulators'''. When undoped, these have electrical conductivity nearer to that of electrical insulators, however they can be doped (making them as useful as semiconductors). Semi-insulators find niche applications in micro-electronics, such as substrates for [[High-electron-mobility transistor|HEMT]]. An example of a common semi-insulator is [[gallium arsenide]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=J. W. Allen|title=Gallium Arsenide as a semi-insulator|journal=Nature|volume= 187|pages=403\u2013405|year=1960|doi=10.1038/187403b0|bibcode = 1960Natur.187..403A|issue=4735}}</ref> Some materials, such as [[titanium dioxide]], can even be used as insulating materials for some applications, while being treated as wide-gap semiconductors for other applications.\n\n===Charge carriers (electrons and holes)===\n\n{{main article|Electron hole}}\n\nThe partial filling of the states at the bottom of the conduction band can be understood as adding electrons to that band.\nThe electrons do not stay indefinitely (due to the natural thermal [[recombination (physics)|recombination]]) but they can move around for some time.\nThe actual concentration of electrons is typically very dilute, and so (unlike in metals) it is possible to think of the electrons in the conduction band of a semiconductor as a sort of classical [[ideal gas]], where the electrons fly around freely without being subject to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. In most semiconductors the conduction bands have a parabolic [[dispersion relation]], and so these electrons respond to forces (electric field, magnetic field, etc.) much like they would in a vacuum, though with a different [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]].<ref name=\"Kittel\"/>\nBecause the electrons behave like an ideal gas, one may also think about conduction in very simplistic terms such as the [[Drude model]], and introduce concepts such as [[electron mobility]].\n\nFor partial filling at the top of the valence band, it is helpful to introduce the concept of an [[electron hole]].\nAlthough the electrons in the valence band are always moving around, a completely full valence band is inert, not conducting any current.\nIf an electron is taken out of the valence band, then the trajectory that the electron would normally have taken is now missing its charge.\nFor the purposes of electric current, this combination of the full valence band, minus the electron, can be converted into a picture of a completely empty band containing a positively charged particle that moves in the same way as the electron.\nCombined with the ''negative'' effective mass of the electrons at the top of the valence band, we arrive at a picture of a positively charged particle that responds to electric and magnetic fields just as a normal positively charged particle would do in vacuum, again with some positive effective mass.<ref name=\"Kittel\"/>\nThis particle is called a hole, and the collection of holes in the valence band can again be understood in simple classical terms (as with the electrons in the conduction band).\n\n====Carrier generation and recombination====\n{{main article|Carrier generation and recombination}}\n\nWhen [[ionizing radiation]] strikes a semiconductor, it may excite an electron out of its energy level and consequently leave a hole. This process is known as [[carrier generation and recombination|''electron\u2013hole pair generation'']]. Electron-hole pairs are constantly generated from [[thermal energy]] as well, in the absence of any external energy source.\n\nElectron-hole pairs are also apt to recombine. [[Conservation of energy]] demands that these recombination events, in which an electron loses an amount of [[energy]] larger than the [[band gap]], be accompanied by the emission of thermal energy (in the form of [[phonon]]s) or radiation (in the form of [[photon]]s).\n\nIn some states, the generation and recombination of electron\u2013hole pairs are in equipoise. The number of electron-hole pairs in the [[steady state]] at a given temperature is determined by [[quantum statistical mechanics]]. The precise [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] mechanisms of generation and recombination are governed by [[conservation of energy]] and [[conservation of momentum]].\n\nAs the probability that electrons and holes meet together is proportional to the product of their amounts, the product is in steady state nearly constant at a given temperature, providing that there is no significant electric field (which might \"flush\" carriers of both types, or move them from neighbour regions containing more of them to meet together) or externally driven pair generation. The product is a function of the temperature, as the probability of getting enough thermal energy to produce a pair increases with temperature, being approximately exp(\u2212''E''<sub>''G''</sub>/''kT''), where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]], ''T'' is absolute temperature and ''E''<sub>''G''</sub> is band gap.\n\nThe probability of meeting is increased by carrier traps\u2014impurities or dislocations which can trap an electron or hole and hold it until a pair is completed. Such carrier traps are sometimes purposely added to reduce the time needed to reach the steady state.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Louis Nashelsky|first1=Robert L.Boylestad|title=Electronic Devices and Circuit Theory|publisher=Prentice-Hall of India Private Limited|location=India|isbn=978-81-203-2967-6|pages=7\u201310|edition=9th}}</ref>\n\n===Doping===\n{{main article|Doping (semiconductor)}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}\nThe conductivity of semiconductors may easily be modified by introducing impurities into their [[crystal lattice]]. The process of adding controlled impurities to a semiconductor is known as ''doping''. The amount of impurity, or dopant, added to an ''[[intrinsic semiconductor|intrinsic]]'' (pure) semiconductor varies its level of conductivity. Doped semiconductors are referred to as [[Extrinsic semiconductor|''extrinsic'']]. By adding impurity to the pure semiconductors, the electrical conductivity may be varied by factors of thousands or millions.\n\nA 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> specimen of a metal or semiconductor has of the order of 10<sup>22</sup> atoms. In a metal, every atom donates at least one free electron for conduction, thus 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> of metal contains on the order of 10<sup>22</sup> free electrons, whereas a 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> sample of pure germanium at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C contains about {{val|4.2|e=22}} atoms, but only {{val|2.5|e=13}} free electrons and {{val|2.5|e=13}} holes. The addition of 0.001% of arsenic (an impurity) donates an extra 10<sup>17</sup> free electrons in the same volume and the electrical conductivity is increased by a factor of 10,000.\n\nThe materials chosen as suitable dopants depend on the atomic properties of both the dopant and the material to be doped. In general, dopants that produce the desired controlled changes are classified as either electron [[Acceptor (semiconductors)|acceptors]] or [[Donor (semiconductors)|donors]]. Semiconductors doped with ''donor'' impurities are called ''n-type'', while those doped with ''acceptor'' impurities are known as ''p-type''. The n and p type designations indicate which charge carrier acts as the material's [[majority carrier]]. The opposite carrier is called the [[minority carrier]], which exists due to thermal excitation at a much lower concentration compared to the majority carrier.\n\nFor example, the pure semiconductor [[silicon]] has four valence electrons which bond each silicon atom to its neighbors. In silicon, the most common dopants are ''group III'' and ''group V'' elements. Group III elements all contain three valence electrons, causing them to function as acceptors when used to dope silicon. When an acceptor atom replaces a silicon atom in the crystal, a vacant state ( an electron \"hole\") is created, which can move around the lattice and functions as a charge carrier.  Group V elements have five valence electrons, which allows them to act as a donor; substitution of these atoms for silicon creates an extra free electron.  Therefore, a silicon crystal doped with [[boron]] creates a p-type semiconductor whereas one doped with [[phosphorus]] results in an n-type material.\n\nDuring [[Semiconductor device fabrication|manufacture]], dopants can be diffused into the semiconductor body by contact with gaseous compounds of the desired element,  or [[ion implantation]] can be used to accurately position the doped regions.\n\n==Early history of semiconductors==\n{{Further information|Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering}}\nThe history of the understanding of semiconductors begins with experiments on the electrical properties of materials. The properties of negative temperature coefficient of resistance, rectification, and light-sensitivity were observed starting in the early 19th century.\n\n[[Thomas Johann Seebeck]] was the first to notice an effect due to semiconductors, in 1821.<ref>[http://www.kirj.ee/public/Engineering/2007/issue_4/eng-2007-4-2.pdf Kirj.ee]</ref> In 1833, [[Michael Faraday]] reported that the resistance of specimens of [[silver sulfide]] decreases when they are heated.  This is contrary to the behavior of metallic substances such as copper. In 1839, [[A. E. Becquerel]] reported observation of a voltage between a solid and a liquid electrolyte when struck by light, the [[photovoltaic effect]]. In 1873 [[Willoughby Smith]] observed that [[selenium]] [[resistor]]s exhibit decreasing resistance when light falls on them. In 1874 [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]] observed conduction and [[Rectifier|rectification]] in metallic sulphides, although this effect had been discovered much earlier by M.A. Rosenschold writing for the Annalen der Physik und Chemie in 1835,<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rslXJmYPjGIC&pg=PA24&dq=Semiconductor+Rectifier+Rosenschold&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi9653MmonKAhVG6RQKHZHADQUQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=Semiconductor%20Rectifier%20Rosenschold&f=false Google Books]</ref> and [[Arthur Schuster]] found that a copper oxide layer on wires has rectification properties that ceases when the wires are cleaned. Adams and Day observed the photovoltaic effect in selenium in 1876.<ref name=JTIT10>{{cite journal|author1=Lidia \u0141ukasiak  |author2=Andrzej Jakubowski  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=January 2010|url=http://www.nit.eu/czasopisma/JTIT/2010/1/3.pdf |title=History of Semiconductors|journal=Journal of Telecommunication and Information Technology|page=3}}</ref>\n\nA unified explanation of these phenomena required a theory of [[solid-state physics]] which developed greatly in the first half of the 20th Century. In 1878 [[Edwin Herbert Hall]] demonstrated the deflection of flowing charge carriers by an applied magnetic field, the [[Hall effect]].  The discovery of the [[electron]] by [[J.J. Thomson]] in 1897 prompted theories of electron-based conduction in solids. [[Karl Baedeker (scientist)|Karl Baedeker]], by observing a Hall effect with the reverse sign to that in metals, theorized that copper iodide had positive charge carriers. [[Johan Koenigsberger]] classified solid materials as metals, insulators and \"variable conductors\" in 1914 although his student Josef Weiss already introduced the term ''Halbleiter'' (semiconductor in modern meaning) in PhD thesis in 1910.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0143-0807/10/4/002 | volume=10 | issue=4 | title=Early history of the physics and chemistry of semiconductors-from doubts to fact in a hundred years | journal=European Journal of Physics | pages=254\u2013264|bibcode = 1989EJPh...10..254B | year=1989 | last1=Busch | first1=G }}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/Experimentelle_Beitr%C3%A4ge_zur_Elektronent.html?id=oVBNQwAACAAJ&redir_esc=y Google Books]</ref> [[Felix Bloch]] published a theory of the movement of electrons through atomic lattices in 1928. In 1930, B. Gudden stated that conductivity in semiconductors was due to minor concentrations of impurities. By 1931, the band theory of conduction had been established by [[Alan Herries Wilson]] and the concept of band gaps had been developed. [[Walter H. Schottky]] and [[Nevill Francis Mott]] developed models of the potential barrier and of the characteristics of a [[metal-semiconductor junction]]. By 1938, [[Boris Davydov]] had developed a theory of the copper-oxide rectifier, identifying the effect of the [[p\u2013n junction]] and the importance of minority carriers and surface states.<ref name=Morris90/>\n\nAgreement between theoretical predictions (based on developing quantum mechanics) and experimental results was sometimes poor. This was later explained by [[John Bardeen]] as due to the extreme \"structure sensitive\" behavior of semiconductors, whose properties change dramatically based on tiny amounts of impurities.<ref name=Morris90/> Commercially pure materials of the 1920s containing varying proportions of trace contaminants produced differing experimental results. This spurred the development of improved material refining techniques, culminating in modern semiconductor refineries producing materials with parts-per-trillion purity.\n\nDevices using semiconductors were at first constructed based on empirical knowledge, before semiconductor theory provided a guide to construction of more capable and reliable devices.\n\n[[Alexander Graham Bell]] used the light-sensitive property of selenium to [[Photophone|transmit sound]] over a beam of light in 1880. A working solar cell, of low efficiency, was constructed by [[Charles Fritts]] in 1883 using a metal plate coated with selenium and a thin layer of gold; the device became commercially useful in photographic light meters in the 1930s.<ref name=Morris90>Peter Robin Morris (1990) ''A History of the World Semiconductor Industry'', IET, ISBN 0-86341-227-0, pp. 11\u201325</ref> Point-contact microwave detector rectifiers made of lead sulfide were used by [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] in 1904; the [[cat's-whisker detector]] using natural galena or other materials became a common device in the [[History of radio|development of radio]]. However, it was somewhat unpredictable in operation and required manual adjustment for best performance. In 1906 [[H.J. Round]] observed light emission when electric current passed through silicon carbide crystals, the principle behind the [[light-emitting diode]]. [[Oleg Losev]] observed similar light emission in 1922 but at the time the effect had no practical use. Power rectifiers, using copper oxide and selenium, were developed in the 1920s and became commercially important as an alternative to [[vacuum tube]] rectifiers.<ref name=JTIT10/><ref name=Morris90/>\n\nIn the years preceding World War II, infra-red detection and communications devices prompted research into lead-sulfide and lead-selenide materials. These devices were used for detecting ships and aircraft, for infrared rangefinders, and for voice communication systems.  The point-contact crystal detector became vital for microwave radio systems, since available vacuum tube devices could not serve as detectors above about 4000&nbsp;MHz; advanced radar systems relied on the fast response of crystal detectors. Considerable research and development of silicon materials occurred during the war to develop detectors of consistent quality.<ref name=Morris90/>\n\nDetector and power rectifiers could not amplify a signal. Many efforts were made to develop a solid-state amplifier, but these were unsuccessful because of limited theoretical understanding of semiconductor materials.<ref name=Morris90/> In 1922 [[Oleg Losev]] developed two-terminal, [[negative resistance]] amplifiers for radio; however, he perished in the [[Siege of Leningrad]]. In 1926 [[Julius Edgar Lilienfeld]] patented a device resembling a modern field-effect transistor, but it was not practical. R. Hilsch and R. W. Pohl in 1938 demonstrated a solid-state amplifier using a structure resembling the control grid of a vacuum tube; although the device displayed power gain, it had a [[cut-off frequency]] of one cycle per second, too low for any practical applications, but an effective application of the available theory.<ref name=Morris90/> At [[Bell Labs]], [[William Shockley]] and A. Holden started investigating solid-state amplifiers in 1938. The first p\u2013n junction in silicon was observed by [[Russell Ohl]] about 1941, when a specimen was found to be light-sensitive, with a sharp boundary between p-type impurity at one end and n-type at the other. A slice cut from the specimen at the p\u2013n boundary developed a voltage when exposed to light.\n\nIn France, during the war, [[Herbert Matar\u00e9]] had observed amplification between adjacent point contacts on a germanium base. After the war, Matar\u00e9's group announced their \"[[Transistron]]\" amplifier only shortly after Bell Labs announced the \"[[transistor]]\".\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Semiconductor industry]]\n* [[Semiconductor characterization techniques]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|author1=A.
