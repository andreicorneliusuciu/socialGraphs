Schottky]]), also known as '''hot carrier diode''', is a [[semiconductor diode]] formed by the junction of a [[semiconductor]] with a metal.  It has a low forward voltage drop and a very fast switching action.  The [[cat's-whisker detector]]s used in the early days of [[wireless#History|wireless]] and [[metal rectifier]]s used in early power applications can be considered primitive Schottky diodes.\n\nWhen sufficient forward voltage is applied, a current flows in the forward direction. A silicon diode has a typical forward voltage of 600\u2013700 mV, while the Schottky's forward voltage is 150 \u2013 450 mV. This lower forward voltage requirement allows higher switching speeds and better system efficiency.\n\n== Construction ==\n{{refimprove|section|date=July 2015}}\n[[File:Schottky Diode Section.JPG|thumb|right|1N5822 Schottky diode with cut-open packaging. The semiconductor in the center makes a [[Schottky barrier]] against one metal electrode (providing rectifying action) and an [[ohmic contact]] with the other electrode.]]\nA [[metal\u2013semiconductor junction]] is formed between a metal and a semiconductor, creating a [[Schottky barrier]] (instead of a [[p\u2013n junction|semiconductor\u2013semiconductor junction]] as in conventional diodes). Typical metals used are molybdenum, platinum, chromium or tungsten, and certain [[silicide]]s (e.g., [[palladium silicide]] and [[platinum silicide]]), whereas the semiconductor would typically be n-type silicon.<ref>\u2018\u2019{{cite book | last1 = Laughton | first1 = M.

This Schottky barrier results in both very fast switching and low forward voltage drop.\n\nThe choice of the combination of the metal and semiconductor determines the forward voltage of the diode. Both n- and p-type semiconductors can develop Schottky barriers. However, the p-type typically has a much lower forward voltage. As the reverse leakage current increases dramatically with lowering the forward voltage, it can not be too low, so the usually employed range is about 0.5\u20130.7&nbsp;V, and p-type semiconductors are employed only rarely. [[Titanium silicide]] and other refractory silicides, which are able to withstand the temperatures needed for source/drain annealing in CMOS processes, usually have too low a forward voltage to be useful, so processes using these silicides therefore usually do not offer Schottky diodes.{{clarification needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nWith increased doping of the semiconductor, the width of the depletion region drops. Below a certain width, the charge carriers can tunnel through the depletion region. At very high doping levels, the junction does not behave as a rectifier anymore and becomes an ohmic contact. This can be used for the simultaneous formation of ohmic contacts and diodes, as a diode will form between the silicide and lightly doped n-type region, and an ohmic contact will form between the silicide and the heavily doped n- or p-type region. Lightly doped p-type regions pose a problem, as the resulting contact has too high a resistance for a good ohmic contact, but too low a forward voltage and too high a reverse leakage to make a good diode.\n\nAs the edges of the Schottky contact are fairly sharp, a high electric field gradient occurs around them, which limits how large the reverse breakdown voltage threshold can be. Various strategies are used, from guard rings to overlaps of metallization to spread out the field gradient. The guard rings consume valuable die area and are used primarily for larger higher-voltage diodes, while overlapping metallization is employed primarily with smaller low-voltage diodes.\n\nSchottky diodes are often used as antisaturation clamps in [[Schottky transistor]]s. Schottky diodes made from palladium silicide (PdSi){{clarify|reason=PtSi is Platinum Silicide \u2013 Pd or Pt?|date=July 2015}} are excellent due to their lower forward voltage (which has to be lower than the forward voltage of the base-collector junction).  The Schottky temperature coefficient is lower than the coefficient of the B\u2013C junction, which limits the use of PdSi at higher temperatures.\n\nFor power Schottky diodes, the parasitic resistances of the buried n+ layer and the epitaxial n-type layer become important. The resistance of the epitaxial layer is more important than it is for a transistor, as the current must cross its entire thickness. However, it serves as a distributed ballasting resistor over the entire area of the junction and, under usual conditions, prevents localized thermal runaway.\n\nIn comparison with the power p\u2013n diodes the Schottky diodes are less rugged. The junction is direct contact with the thermally sensitive metallization, a Schottky diode can therefore dissipate less power than an equivalent-size p-n counterpart with a deep-buried junction before failing (especially during reverse breakdown). The relative advantage of the lower forward voltage of Schottky diodes is diminished at higher forward currents, where the voltage drop is dominated by the series resistance.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Hastings|title=The Art of Analog Layout|edition=2nd |year=2005|publisher=Prentice Hall|ISBN=0-13-146410-8}}</ref>\n\n== Reverse recovery time ==\nThe most important difference between the [[p-n junction|p-n]] diode and the Schottky diode is the reverse recovery time (t<sub>rr</sub>), when the diode switches from the conducting to the non-conducting state. In a p\u2013n diode, the reverse recovery time can be in the order of hundreds of nanoseconds to less than 100&nbsp;ns for fast diodes. Schottky diodes do not have a recovery time, as there is nothing to recover from (i.e., there is no charge carrier depletion region at the junction). The switching time is ~100 [[picosecond|ps]] for the small-signal diodes, and up to tens of nanoseconds for special high-capacity power diodes. With p\u2013n-junction switching, there is also a reverse recovery current, which in high-power semiconductors brings increased [[Electromagnetic interference|EMI]] noise. With Schottky diodes, switching is essentially \"instantaneous\" with only a slight capacitive loading, which is much less of a concern.\n\nThis \"instantaneous\" switching is not always the case. In higher voltage Schottky devices, in particular, the guard ring structure needed to control breakdown field geometry creates a parasitic p-n diode with the usual recovery time attributes. As long as this guard ring diode is not forward biased, it adds only capacitance. If the Schottky junction is driven hard enough however, the forward voltage eventually will bias both diodes forward and actual t<sub>rr</sub> will be greatly impacted. \n\nIt is often said that the Schottky diode is a \"[[majority carrier]]\" semiconductor device. This means that if the semiconductor body is a [[doping (semiconductors)|doped]] n-type, only the n-type carriers (mobile [[electron]]s) play a significant role in normal operation of the device.  The majority carriers are quickly injected into the conduction band of the metal contact on the other side of the diode to become [[Metal#Physical properties|free moving electrons]]. Therefore, no slow random [[recombination (physics)|recombination]] of n and p type carriers is involved, so that this diode can cease conduction faster than an ordinary p\u2013n rectifier [[diode]]. This property in turn allows a smaller device area, which also makes for a faster transition. This is another reason why Schottky diodes are useful in switch-mode [[Electric power conversion|power converters]]: the high speed of the diode means that the circuit can operate at frequencies in the range 200&nbsp;kHz to 2&nbsp;MHz, allowing the use of small [[inductor]]s and [[capacitor]]s with greater efficiency than would be possible with other diode types. Small-area Schottky diodes are the heart of RF [[Detector (radio)|detectors]] and [[Frequency mixer|mixers]], which often operate at frequencies up to 50&nbsp;GHz.\n\n== Limitations ==\nThe most evident limitations of Schottky diodes are their relatively low reverse voltage ratings, and their relatively high [[reverse leakage current]]. For silicon-metal Schottky diodes, the reverse voltage is typically 50 V or less.  Some higher-voltage designs are available (200 V is considered a high reverse voltage).\nReverse leakage current, since it increases with temperature, leads to a [[thermal runaway|thermal instability]] issue. This often limits the useful reverse voltage to well below the actual rating.\n\nWhile higher reverse voltages are achievable, they would present a higher forward voltage, comparable to other types of standard diodes. Such Schottky diodes would have no advantage <ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.microsemi.com/sites/default/files/micnotes/401.pdf|title=Introduction to Schottky Rectifiers|work=MicroNotes|series=401|quote=Schottky rectifiers seldom exceed 100 volts in their working peak reverse voltage since devices moderately above this rating level will result in forward voltages equal to or greater than equivalent pn junction rectifiers.}}</ref> unless great switching speed is required.\n\n== Silicon carbide Schottky diode ==\nSchottky diodes constructed from [[silicon carbide]] have a much lower reverse leakage current than [[silicon]] Schottky diodes, as well as higher forward voltage and reverse voltage. {{As of|2011}} they were available from manufacturers in variants up to 1700 V of reverse voltage.<ref name=SiC>[http://powerelectronics.com/images/SchottkyDiodes.pdf Power Electronics Technology: Schottky Diodes: the Old Ones Are Good, the New Ones Are Better]</ref>\n\nSilicon carbide has a high thermal conductivity, and temperature has little influence on its switching and thermal characteristics.  With special packaging, silicon carbide Schottky diodes can operate at junction temperatures of over 500&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] (about 200&nbsp;\u00b0C), which allows passive [[Thermal radiation|radiative]] cooling in [[aerospace]] applications.<ref name=SiC />\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Voltage clamping ===\nWhile standard silicon diodes have a forward voltage drop of about 0.6 V and germanium diodes 0.2 V, Schottky diodes\u2019 voltage drop at forward biases of around 1 [[Milliampere|mA]] is in the range of 0.15 V to 0.46 V (see the 1N5817<ref name=1N5817>{{cite web|url=http://www.datasheetcatalog.com/datasheets_pdf/1/N/5/8/1N5817.shtml |title=1N5817 Datasheets (PDF) |publisher=Datasheetcatalog.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-14}}</ref> and 1N5711<ref name=1N5711>{{cite web|url=http://www.datasheetcatalog.com/datasheets_pdf/1/N/5/7/1N5711.shtml |title=1N5711 Datasheets (PDF) |publisher=Datasheetcatalog.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-14}}</ref> datasheets found online at manufacturer's websites), which makes them useful in voltage [[Clamper (electronics)|clamping applications]] and prevention of [[Bipolar transistor#Regions of operation|transistor saturation]]. This is due to the higher [[current density]] in the Schottky diode.\n\n=== Reverse current and discharge protection ===\nBecause of a Schottky diode's low forward voltage drop; less energy is wasted as heat, making them the most efficient choice for applications sensitive to efficiency. For instance, they are used in stand-alone (\"off-grid\") [[photovoltaic]] (PV) systems to prevent [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] from discharging through the solar panels at night, called \"blocking diodes\". They are also used in grid-connected systems with multiple strings connected in parallel, in order to prevent reverse current flowing from adjacent strings through shaded strings if the \"bypass diodes\" have failed.\n\n=== Switched-mode power supplies ===\nSchottky diode are also used as [[rectifiers]] in [[switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]]. The low forward voltage and fast recovery time leads to increased efficiency.\n\nThey can also be used in power supply \"[[OR gate#Wired-OR|OR]]\"ing circuits in products that have both an internal [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] and a [[mains adapter]] input, or similar. However, the high reverse leakage current presents a problem in this case, as any high-impedance voltage sensing circuit (e.g., monitoring the battery voltage or detecting whether a mains adapter is present) will see the voltage from the other power source through the diode leakage.\n\n== Designation ==\n[[File:SS14 1A DO-214 Schottky diode.jpg|thumb|right|SS14 schottky diode in a

[[List of semiconductor materials#Group III-V|III-V-semiconductor]] devices, [[laser diode]]s and, to a lesser extent, exposed lines of [[CMOS]] circuitry.\n\nSchottky metal\u2013semiconductor junctions are featured in the successors to the [[7400 series|7400]] [[Transistor\u2013transistor logic|TTL]] family of [[logic device]]s, the 74S, 74LS and 74ALS series, where they are employed as

less power dissipation is desired, a [[MOSFET]] and a control circuit can be used instead, in an operation mode known as [[active rectification]].\n\nA [[Precision rectifier|super diode]] consisting of a pn-diode or Schottky diode and an [[operational amplifier]] provides an almost perfect diode characteristic due to the effect of negative feedback, although its use is restricted to frequencies
