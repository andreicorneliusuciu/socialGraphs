Objects cannot accelerate to the speed of light within normal spacetime; instead, the Alcubierre drive shifts space around an object so that the object would arrive at its destination faster than light would in normal space without breaking any [[physical laws]].<ref name=\"Krasnikov2003\">{{cite journal|first=S. |last=Krasnikov|title=The quantum inequalities do not forbid spacetime shortcuts|journal=[[Physical Review D]] |date=2003|volume=67|pages=104013|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.67.104013|arxiv = gr-qc/0207057 |bibcode = 2003PhRvD..67j4013K|issue=10}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the metric proposed by Alcubierre is mathematically valid (in that the proposal is consistent with the Einstein field equations), it may not be physically meaningful, in which case a drive will not be possible. Even if it is physically meaningful, its possibility would not necessarily mean that a drive can be constructed. The proposed mechanism of the Alcubierre drive implies a negative [[energy density]] and therefore requires [[exotic matter]].

It is a [[Lorentzian manifold]] that, if interpreted in the context of [[general relativity]], allows a warp bubble to appear in previously flat spacetime and move away effectively [[faster than light]]speed. The interior of the bubble is an [[inertial reference frame]] and inhabitants suffer no proper acceleration. This method of transport does not involve objects in motion at speeds faster than light with respect to the contents of the warp bubble; that is, a light beam within the warp bubble would still always move faster than the ship. Because objects within the bubble are not moving (locally) faster than light, the mathematical formulation of the Alcubierre metric is consistent with the conventional claims of the laws of relativity (namely, that an object with mass cannot attain or exceed the speed of light) and conventional [[special relativity|relativistic]] effects such as [[time dilation]] would not apply as they would with conventional motion at near-light speeds.\n\nThe Alcubierre drive, however, remains a hypothetical concept with seemingly difficult problems, though the amount of energy required is no longer thought to be unobtainably large.<ref name=\"WDmorefeasible\">{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/17628-warp-drive-possible-interstellar-spaceflight.html|title=Warp Drive May Be More Feasible Than Thought, Scientists Say |first=Clara |last=Moskowitz |date=17 September 2012 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Mathematics of the Alcubierre drive==\nUsing the [[ADM formalism]] of [[general relativity]], the [[spacetime]] is described by a [[foliation]] of space-like [[hypersurface]]s of constant coordinate time {{mvar|t}}, with the metric taking the following general form:\n\n:<math>ds^2 = -\\left(\\alpha^2- \\beta_i \\beta^i\\right)\\,dt^2+2 \\beta_i \\,dx^i\\, dt+ \\gamma_{ij}\\,dx^i\\,dx^j\\,,</math>\n\nwhere\n*{{mvar|\u03b1}} is the lapse function that gives the interval of proper time between nearby hypersurfaces,\n*{{mvar|\u03b2<sup>i</sup>}} is the shift vector that relates the spatial coordinate systems on different hypersurfaces, and\n*{{mvar|\u03b3<sub>ij</sub>}} is a positive definite metric on each of the hypersurfaces.\n\nThe particular form that Alcubierre studied<ref name=\"Alcubierre\" /> is defined by:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\\alpha&=1\\,,\\\\\n\\beta^x&=-v_s(t)f\\left(r_s(t)\\right)\\,,\\\\\n\\beta^y&=\\beta^z=0\\,,\\\\\n\\gamma_{ij}&=\\delta_{ij}\\,,\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}v_s(t)&=\\frac{dx_s(t)}{dt}\\,,\\\\\nr_s(t)&=\\sqrt{(x-x_s(t))^2+y^2+z^2}\\,,\\\\\nf(r_s)&=\\frac{\\tanh(\\sigma (r_s + R))-\\tanh(\\sigma (r_s - R))}{2 \\tanh(\\sigma R)}\\,,\\end{align}</math>\n\nwith arbitrary parameters {{math|''R'' > 0}} and {{math|''\u03c3'' > 0}}.

In particular, Alcubierre has shown that a ship using an Alcubierre drive travels on a free-fall geodesic even while the warp bubble is accelerating: its crew would be in free fall while accelerating without experiencing accelerational [[g-force]]s. Enormous [[tidal force]]s, however, would be present near the edges of the flat-space volume because of the large space curvature there, but suitable specification of the metric would keep them very small within the volume occupied by the ship.<ref name=\"Alcubierre\" />\n\nThe original warp-drive metric and simple variants of it happen to have the [[ADM formalism|ADM form]], which is often used in discussing the initial-value formulation of general relativity. This may explain the widespread misconception that this spacetime is a ''solution'' of the field equation of general relativity.{{Citation needed|reason=that Natario paper does not seem to say it's a \"misconception\" that the Alcubierre drive is a solution, it just talks about the misconception that it requires space in front of the bubble to contract and space behind it to expand|date=August 2013}} Metrics in ADM form are ''adapted'' to a certain family of inertial observers, but these observers are not really physically distinguished from other such families.

This practice means that the solution can violate various [[energy conditions]] and require [[exotic matter]]. The need for exotic matter raises questions about whether one can distribute the matter in an initial spacetime that lacks a warp bubble in such a way that the bubble is created at a later time, although some physicists have proposed models of dynamical warp-drive spacetimes in which a warp bubble is formed in a previously flat space.<ref name=Finazzi>{{cite journal|author1=Finazzi, Stefano|author2=Liberati, Stefano|author3=Barcel\u00f3, Carlos |title=Semiclassical instability of dynamical warp drives|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|date=2009|volume=79|pages=124017|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.79.124017|bibcode = 2009PhRvD..79l4017F|issue=12 |arxiv = 0904.0141 }}</ref> Moreover, according to [[Serguei Krasnikov]],<ref name=\"Krasnikov1998\">{{cite journal|first=S.|last=Krasnikov|title=Hyper-fast travel in general relativity|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|date=1998|volume=57|pages=4760|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.57.4760|arxiv = gr-qc/9511068 |bibcode = 1998PhRvD..57.4760K|issue=8}}</ref> generating a bubble in a previously flat space for a ''one-way'' FTL trip requires forcing the exotic matter to move at local faster-than-light speeds, something that would require the existence of [[tachyons]], although Krasnikov also notes that when the spacetime is not flat from the outset, a similar result could be achieved without tachyons by placing in advance some devices along the travel path and programming them to come into operation at preassigned moments and to operate in a preassigned manner.

Some results in [[semiclassical gravity]] appear to support the conjecture, including a calculation dealing specifically with quantum effects in warp-drive spacetimes that suggested that warp bubbles would be semiclassically unstable,<ref name=Finazzi /><ref name=Barcelo>{{cite arXiv |author1=Barcel\u00f3, Carlos|author2=Finazzi, Stefano|author3=Liberati, Stefano |eprint = 1001.4960| title=On the impossibility of superluminal travel: the warp drive lesson|class=gr-qc |date=2010}}</ref> but ultimately the conjecture can only be decided by a full theory of [[quantum gravity]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Visser | first = Matt | title = The reliability horizon for semi-classical quantum gravity: Metric fluctuations are often more important than back-reaction | journal = Physics Letters B | volume = 415 | issue = 1 | pages = 8\u201314 | date = December 1997 | url = http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9702041 | doi = 10.1016/S0370-2693(97)01226-4 | accessdate = 24 July 2013|arxiv = gr-qc/9702041 |bibcode = 1997PhLB..415....8V }}</ref>\n\nMiguel Alcubierre briefly discusses some of these issues in a series of lecture slides posted online,<ref>http://ccrg.rit.edu/files/FasterThanLight.pdf</ref> where he writes \"beware: in relativity, any method to travel faster than light can in principle be used to travel back in time (a time machine).\" In the next slide he brings up the chronology protection conjecture, and writes \"The conjecture has not been proven (it wouldn\u2019t be a conjecture if it had), but there are good arguments in its favor based on quantum field theory. The conjecture does not prohibit faster-than-light travel. It just states that if a method to travel faster than light exists, and one tries to use it to build a time machine, something will go wrong: the energy accumulated will explode, or it will create a black hole.\"\n\n==Experiments==\n{{main article|Warp-field experiments|White\u2013Juday warp-field interferometer}}\nIn 2012, a [[NASA]] laboratory announced that they had constructed an [[interferometer]] that they claim will detect the spatial distortions produced by the expanding and contracting spacetime of the Alcubierre metric.
