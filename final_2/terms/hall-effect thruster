Hall-effect thrusters trap electrons in a [[magnetic field]] and then use the electrons to ionize propellant, efficiently accelerate the [[ion]]s to produce [[thrust]], and neutralize the ions in the plume. Hall-effect thrusters are sometimes referred to as '''Hall thrusters''' or '''Hall-current thrusters'''. Hall thrusters are often regarded as a moderate [[specific impulse]] (1,600 s) [[space propulsion]] technology. The Hall-effect thruster has benefited from considerable theoretical and experimental research since the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hofer, Richard R.|title=Development and Characterization of High-Efficiency, High-Specific Impulse Xenon Hall Thrusters|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20040084644|work=NASA/CR\u20142004-21309|publisher=NASA STI Program|accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Xenon hall thruster.jpg|thumb|6 kW Hall thruster in operation at the [[NASA]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].]]\n\nHall thrusters operate on a variety of propellants, the most common being [[xenon]].

The thrust produced by a Hall thruster varies depending on the power level.  Devices operating at 1.35&nbsp;kW produce about 83&nbsp;mN of thrust.

Over 200 Hall thrusters have been flown on Soviet/Russian satellites in the past thirty years. No failures have ever occurred on orbit.  Hall thruster continue to be used on Russian spacecraft and have also flown on European and American spacecraft.  [[Space Systems/Loral]], an American commercial satellite manufacturer, now flies Fakel SPT-100's on their GEO communications spacecraft.\n\nSince their introduction to the west in the early 1990s, Hall thrusters have been the subject of a large number of research efforts throughout the United States, France, Italy, Japan, and Russia (with many smaller efforts scattered in various countries across the globe).  Hall thruster research in the US is conducted at several government laboratories, universities and private companies. Government and government funded centers include NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], NASA's [[Glenn Research Center]], the [[Air Force Research Laboratory]] (Edwards AFB, CA), and [[The Aerospace Corporation]].  Universities include the [http://www.afit.edu/PA/news.cfm?article=101&a=news US Air Force Institute of Technology], [[University of Michigan]], [[Stanford University]], [[The Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Princeton University]], [[Michigan Technological University]], and [[Georgia Tech]]. A considerable amount of development is being conducted in industry, such as [[Aerojet]] and [[Busek]] in the USA, [[SNECMA]] in France and in Italy.<ref>[http://www.alta-space.com ALTA]</ref> Also, [[T\u00dcB\u0130TAK Space Technologies Research Institute|T\u00dcBITAK Space]] of Turkey has recently developed a Hall thruster prototype.

The first American Hall thruster to fly in space was the [[Busek]] BHT-200 on [[TacSat-2]] technology demonstration spacecraft.  The first flight of an American Hall thruster on an operational mission, was the [[Aerojet]] BPT-4000, which launched August 2010 on the military [[Advanced Extremely High Frequency]] GEO communications satellite. At 4.5&nbsp;kW, the BPT-4000 is also the highest power Hall thruster ever flown in space.  Besides the usual stationkeeping tasks, the BPT-4000 is also providing orbit raising capability to the spacecraft.  Several countries worldwide continue efforts to qualify Hall thruster technology for commercial uses.\n\n== Operation ==\nThe essential working principle of the Hall thruster is that it uses an [[electrostatic potential]] to accelerate ions up to high speeds.  In a Hall thruster the attractive negative charge is provided by an electron plasma at the open end of the thruster instead of a grid.  A radial magnetic field of about 100\u2013300&nbsp;[[gauss (unit)|G]] (0.01\u20130.03&nbsp;[[tesla (unit)|T]]) is used to confine the electrons, where the combination of the radial magnetic field and axial electric field cause the electrons to drift in azimuth thus forming the Hall current from which the device gets its name.\n\n[[Image:Wfm hall thruster.svg|400px|thumb|Hall thruster. Hall thrusters are largely axially symmetric. This is a cross-section containing that axis.]]\nA schematic of a Hall thruster is shown in the adjacent image. An [[electric potential]] between 150 and 800 volts is applied between the [[anode]] and [[cathode]].\n\nThe central spike forms one pole of an [[electromagnet]] and is surrounded by an annular space, and around that is the other pole of the electromagnet, with a radial magnetic field in between.\n\nThe propellant, such as [[Xenon]] gas, is fed through the anode, which has numerous small holes in it to act as a gas distributor.  Xenon propellant is used because of its high [[atomic weight]] and low [[ionization potential]].  As the neutral Xenon atoms diffuse into the channel of the thruster, they are ionized by collisions with circulating high-energy electrons (typically 10\u201340&nbsp;eV, or about 10% of the discharge voltage).  Once ionized, the Xenon ions typically have a charge of +1, though a small fraction (~20%) have +2.\n\nThe Xenon ions are then accelerated by the [[electric field]] between the anode and the cathode.  For discharge voltages of 300&nbsp;V, the ions reach speeds of around 15&nbsp;km/s (9.3 mps) for a specific impulse of 1,500 seconds (15&nbsp;kN\u00b7s/kg).  Upon exiting, however, the ions pull an equal number of electrons with them, creating a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] plume with no net charge.\n\nThe radial magnetic field is designed to be strong enough to substantially deflect the low-mass electrons, but not the high-mass ions, which have a much larger [[gyroradius]] and are hardly impeded.  The majority of electrons are thus stuck orbiting in the region of high radial magnetic field near the thruster exit plane, trapped in '''E'''\u00d7'''B''' (axial electric field and radial magnetic field).  This orbital rotation of the electrons is a circulating [[Hall effect|Hall current]], and it is from this that the Hall thruster gets its name.  Collisions with other particles and walls, as well as plasma instabilities, allow some of the electrons to be freed from the magnetic field, and they drift towards the anode.\n\nAbout 20\u201330% of the discharge current is an electron current, which does not produce thrust, thus limiting the energetic efficiency of the thruster; the other 70\u201380% of the current is in the ions.  Because the majority of electrons are trapped in the Hall current, they have a long residence time inside the thruster and are able to ionize almost all of the Xenon propellant, allowing mass utilizations of 90\u201399%.  The mass utilization efficiency of the thruster is thus around 90%, while the discharge current efficiency is around 70%, for a combined thruster efficiency of around 63% (= 90% \u00d7 70%).  Modern Hall thrusters have achieved efficiencies as high as 75% through advanced designs.\n\nCompared to chemical rockets, the thrust is very small, on the order of 83&nbsp;mN for a typical thruster operating at 300&nbsp;V, 1.5&nbsp;kW.  For comparison, the weight of a coin like the [[quarter (U.S. coin)|U.S. quarter]] or a 20-cent [[Euro coin]] is approximately 60&nbsp;mN.  As with all forms of [[electrically powered spacecraft propulsion]], thrust is limited by available power, efficiency, and [[specific impulse]].\n\nHowever, Hall thrusters operate at the high [[specific impulse]]s that is typical for electric propulsion. One particular advantage of Hall thrusters, as compared to a gridded ion thruster, is that the generation and acceleration of the ions takes place in a quasi-neutral plasma, so there is no [[Space charge|Child-Langmuir charge (space charge)]] [[saturation current|saturated current]] limitation on the thrust density.  This allows much smaller thrusters compared to gridded ion thrusters.\n\nAnother advantage is that these thrusters can use a wider variety of propellants supplied to the anode, even oxygen, although something easily ionized is needed at the cathode.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.permanent.com/space-transportation-electric.html#how-russ|title = Hall-Effect Stationary Plasma thrusters|date = |accessdate = 2014-06-16|website = Electric Propulsion for Inter-Orbital Vehicles|publisher = }}[http://www.permanent.com/t-el-iov.htm#how-russ <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Cylindrical Hall thrusters==\nAlthough conventional (annular) Hall thrusters are efficient in the [[kilowatt]] power regime, they become inefficient when scaled to small sizes.  This is due to the difficulties associated with holding the performance scaling parameters constant while decreasing the channel size and increasing the applied [[magnetic field]] strength. This led to the design of the cylindrical Hall thruster.  The cylindrical Hall thruster can be more readily scaled to smaller sizes due to its nonconventional discharge-chamber geometry and associated [[magnetic field]] profile.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Y.
