The front of the H attaches to the body via rubber [[Bushing (isolator)|bushing]]s, and the rear of the H carries each stub-axle assembly, on each side of the car.  The cross beam of the H holds the two trailing arms together, and provides the [[sway bar|roll stiffness]] of the suspension, by twisting as the two trailing arms move vertically, relative to each other.\n\n==About==\nThe coil springs usually bear on a pad alongside the stub-axle.  Often the shock is colinear with the spring, to form a coilover.  This location gives them a very high motion ratio compared with most suspensions, which improves their performance, and reduces their weight.\n\nThe longitudinal location of the cross beam controls important parameters of the suspension's behaviour, such as the [[roll steer]] curve and [[toe (automotive)|toe]] and [[camber angle|camber]] compliance.  The closer the cross beam to the axle stubs the more the camber and toe changes under deflection.  A key difference between the camber and toe changes of a twist beam vs independent suspension is the change in camber and toe is dependent on the position of the other wheel, not the car's chassis.  In a traditional independent suspension the camber and toe are based on the position of the wheel relative to the body.  If both wheels compress together their camber and toe will not change.  Thus if both wheels started perpendicular to the road and car compressed together they will stay perpendicular to the road.  The camber and toe changes are the result of one wheel being compressed relative to the other.<ref>http://www.worldautosteel.org/uploaded/ULSAS_EngRpt_Twistbeam_Design.pdf</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Twistbeam-suspension-rest.JPG|Conceptual model of a twist beam suspension.

The deflected wheel now has negative camber.  The left and right axles are no longer aligned.  The right wheel's camber has changed to positive due to the deflection of the left wheel.  \nImage:Twistbeam-suspension-left-fade-up.JPG|Single wheel deflection (deflection due to roll) vs both wheels up (deflection in bump).  Note that when both wheels are deflected the axles remain in line and the wheels have no camber change.  \nImage:Twistbeam-suspension-left-fade-rest.JPG|Single wheel deflection shown vs both wheels at rest.  \nImage:Twistbeam-suspension-up-fade-down.JPG|Both wheels shown deflected up (bump) and at rest.  Note that the axle halves remain in line and the wheel camber does not change.\n</gallery>\n\nThis suspension is commonly used on a wide variety of front wheel drive cars (mainly compacts and subcompacts), and was almost ubiquitous on European [[supermini car|superminis]]. It was popularised by Volkswagen when they changed from rear engined [[RR layout]] cars in the 1970s, to front wheel drive [[FF layout]] cars.\n\nThis suspension is usually described as semi-independent, meaning that the two wheels can move relative to each other, but their motion is still somewhat inter-linked, to a greater extent than in a true independent rear suspension (IRS). This can mildly compromise the handling and ride quality of the vehicle. For this reason, some manufacturers have changed to different linkage designs. As an example, [[Volkswagen]] dropped the twist-beam in favour of a true IRS for the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5]], possibly in response to the [[Ford Focus (International)|Ford Focus]]' Control Blade rear suspension as well as the [[Hyundai Elantra (HD)]] or newer and [[Hyundai i30]]. General Motors in Europe [[Vauxhall]]/[[Opel]] have continued to use twist- or torsion- beam suspension. This is at a cost saving of \u20ac100 per car compared to multi-link rear suspension.<ref>http://www.richardaucock.com/astra-suspension-by-automotive-engineer/</ref> Their latest version as used in the 2009-on [[Opel Astra]] uses a [[Watts linkage]] at a cost of \u20ac20 to address the drawbacks and provide a competitive and cost effective rear suspension.<ref>http://www.richardaucock.com/astra-suspension-by-automotive-engineer/</ref> The [[Renault Megane]] and [[Citroen C4]] also have stayed with the twist beam.<ref>http://ae-plus.com/focus/vehicle-dynamics-and-chassis-a-new-leaf</ref>\nToyota also switched from torsion beam to multilink with the 2007 [[Toyota Auris|Auris]] E150.\n\n==Advantages==\n\n*Low cost\n*Can be durable\n*Fewer bushings than [[multi-link suspension]] that are less stressed and less prone to wear\n*Simple\n*Neat package, reduces clutter under floor\n*Fairly light weight\n*Springs and shocks can be light and cheap\n*No need for a separate [[anti-roll bar]] - the axle itself performs that function\n\n==Disadvantages==\n\n*Basic toe vs lateral force characteristic is [[oversteer]]\n*Since toe characteristics may be unsuitable, adding toe-control [[Bushing (isolator)|bushing]]s may be expensive.\n*Camber characteristics are very limited.\n*Not very easy to adjust roll stiffness\n*Welds see a lot of fatigue, may need a lot of development\n*Not much recession compliance - can be poor for impact harshness, and will cause unwelcome toe changes (steer effects)\n*Wheel moves forward as it rises, can also be poor for impact harshness (this can be negated by designing the beam with the mounts higher than the stub axles, which impacts on the floorpan height, and causes more roll oversteer)\n*Need to package room for exhaust and so on past the cross beam\n*Camber compliance may be high\n*No redress for wheel alignment. Alignment geometry is factory-set and not generally adjustable. Any deviation from factory specifications/tolerances could mean a bent axle or compromised mounting points.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n*{{cite web|title=Trailing arm and Semi-trailing arm suspension|url=http://www.autozine.org/technical_school/suspension/tech_suspension21.htm|publisher=AutoZine}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.tubenet.org.uk/technical/vallf.jpg A picture of a twist beam] \n\n{{Automotive handling}}\n[[Category:Automotive suspension technologies]]"}]}}}}
