In 2001, two thirds of the scientific community who have the requisite background to evaluate polygraph procedures considered polygraphy to be [[pseudoscience]].<ref>Iacono, W.G. \"Forensic 'lie detection': Procedures without scientific basis,\" ''Journal of Forensic Psychology Practice'', Vol. 1 (2001), No. 1, pp. 75-86.</ref> In 2002, a review by the National Academies of Science found that in populations untrained in [[countermeasure]]s, polygraph testing can discriminate lying from truth telling at rates above chance, though below perfection.<ref name=NAS2003>{{cite book |title=The polygraph and lie detection |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C |year=2003 |pages=4\u20135 |isbn=0-309-08436-9 |oclc= |doi=|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309084369}}</ref> These results apply only to specific events and not to screening where it is assumed that polygraph would work less well.<ref name=NAS2003/> Effectiveness may also be worsened by countermeasures.<ref name=NAS2003/>\n\nIn some countries polygraphs are used as an [[interrogation]] tool with criminal suspects or candidates for sensitive public or private sector employment. US law enforcement and federal government agencies such as the FBI and the CIA and many police departments such as the LAPD use polygraph examinations to interrogate suspects and screen new employees. Within the US federal government, a polygraph examination is also referred to as a psychophysiological detection of deception (PDD) examination.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nPolygraph testing is designed to analyze the physiological reactions of subjects. However, research has indicated that there is no specific physiological reaction associated with lying and that the brain activity and mechanisms associated with lying are unknown, making it difficult to identify factors that separate liars from truth tellers. Polygraph examiners also prefer to use their own individual scoring method, as opposed to computerized techniques, as they may more easily defend their own evaluations.<ref name=\"Iacono, W. G. 2008\">{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Effective policing: Understanding how polygraph tests work and are used|url=|journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior|volume=35|issue=10|pages=1295\u20131308|last1=Iacono|first1=W. G.}}</ref>\n\nThe validity of polygraph testing is again called in to question with the relevant-irrelevant testing technique, designed to gauge reactions of subjects against crime questions and other non-crime related questions. Studies have indicated that this questioning technique is not ideal, as many innocent subjects exert a heightened physiological reaction to the crime relevant questions.<ref name=\"Iacono, W. G. 2008\"/>\n\nThe control question test, also known as the probable lie test, was developed to combat the issues with the relevant-irrelevant testing method. Although the relevant questions in the probable lie test are used to obtain a reaction from liars, it can also gain a reaction from the innocent subject who is afraid of false detection. The physiological reactions that \"distinguish\" liars, may also occur in individuals who fear a false detection, or feel passionately that they did not commit the crime. Therefore, although a physiological reaction may be occurring, the reasoning behind the response may be different. Further examination of the probable lie test has indicated that it is biased against innocent subjects. Those who are unable to think of a lie related to the relevant question, will automatically fail the test.<ref name=\"Iacono, W. G. 2008\"/>\n\nPolygraph examiners, or polygraphers, are licensed or regulated in some jurisdictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygraph.org/section/state-licensing-boards-0|title=State licensing boards|work=American Polygraph Association|accessdate=13 August 2014}}</ref> The [[American Polygraph Association]] sets standards for courses of training of polygraph operators, though it does not certify individual examiners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygraph.org/section/training/apa-accredited-polygraph-programs|title=APA Accredited Polygraph Programs|work=American Polygraph Association|accessdate=13 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Testing procedure==\nThe examiner typically begins polygraph test sessions with a pre-test [[interview]] to gain some preliminary information which will later be used to develop diagnostic questions. Then the tester will explain how the polygraph is supposed to work, emphasizing that it can detect lies and that it is important to answer truthfully. Then a \"stim test\" is often conducted: the subject is asked to deliberately lie and then the tester reports that he was able to detect this lie. [[Guilt (emotion)|Guilt]]y subjects are likely to become more anxious when they are reminded of the test's validity.  However, there are risks of innocent subjects being equally or more anxious than the guilty.<ref name=\"Lewis, J. A. 2009\">{{cite journal | last1 = Lewis | first1 = J.

Some of the questions asked are \"irrelevant\" or IR (\"Is your name Fred?\"), others are \"diagnostic\" questions, and the remainder are the \"relevant questions\", or RQ, that the tester is really interested in. The different types of questions alternate. The test is passed if the physiological responses to the diagnostic questions are larger than those during the relevant questions (RQ).\n\nCriticisms have been given regarding the validity of the administration of the Control Question Technique (CQT). The CQT may be vulnerable to being conducted in an interrogation-like fashion. This kind of interrogation style would elicit a nervous response from innocent and guilty suspects alike. There are several other ways of administering the questions.\n\nAn alternative is the Guilty Knowledge Test (GKT), or the Concealed Information Test (CIT), which is being used in [[Japan]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url         = http://digitool.haifa.ac.il/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&object_id=673186&local_base=GEN01| title       = The Admissibility of Polygraph Evidence in Criminal Courts\n| author      = Don Sosunov\n| date        = October 14, 2010\n}}</ref> The administration of this test is given to prevent potential errors that may arise from the questioning style. The test is usually conducted by a tester with no knowledge of the [[crime]] or circumstances in question. The administrator tests the participant on their knowledge of the crime that would not be known to an innocent person. For example: \"Was the crime committed with a .45 or a 9 mm?\" The questions are in multiple choice and the participant is rated on how they react to the correct answer. If they react strongly to the guilty information, then proponents of the test believe that it is likely that they know facts relevant to the case. This administration is considered more valid by supporters of the test because it contains many safeguards to avoid the risk of the administrator influencing the results.<ref>For more info on the GKT, see the [http://websites.mscc.huji.ac.il/zerolab/GKTCHAP3.PDF The Guilty Knowledge Test (GKT) as an Application of Psychophysiology: Future Prospects and Obstacles].</ref>\n\n==Validity==\nPolygraphy is widely criticized.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/polygraph/ota/index.html |accessdate=2008-02-29 |title=Scientific Validity of Polygraph Testing: A Research Review and Evaluation |publisher= Washington, D.

CQT theory is based on naive, implausible assumptions indicating (a) that it is biased against innocent individuals and (b) that it can be beaten simply by artificially augmenting responses to control questions. Although it is not possible to adequately assess the error rate of the CQT, both of these conclusions are supported by published research findings in the best social science journals (Honts et al., 1994; Horvath, 1977; Kleinmuntz & Szucko, 1984; Patrick & Iacono, 1991). Although defense attorneys often attempt to have the results of friendly CQTs admitted as evidence in court, there is no evidence supporting their validity and ample reason to doubt it. Members of scientific organizations who have the requisite background to evaluate the CQT are overwhelmingly skeptical of the claims made by polygraph proponents.<ref>{{cite web|author=William G.

Martin, PhD, from [[North Carolina State University]], states that people have tried to use the polygraph for measuring human emotions, but there is simply no royal road to (measuring) human emotions.<ref>[http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/psychology-of-human-behavior.html Psychology of Human Behavior] The Teaching Company, course No. 1620 taught by David W. Martin, lesson 19.</ref> Therefore, since one cannot reliably measure human emotions (especially when one has an interest in hiding his/her emotions), the idea of valid detection of truth or falsehood through measuring respiratory rate, blood volume, pulse rate and galvanic skin response is a mere pretense.

In 2003, the [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) issued a report entitled \"The Polygraph and Lie Detection\". The NAS found that the majority of polygraph research was \"unreliable, unscientific and biased\", concluding that 57 of the approximately 80 research studies that the [[American Polygraph Association]] relies on to come to their conclusions were significantly flawed.<ref>[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10420&page=212 \"Conclusions and Recommendations\"] ''The Polygraph and Lie Detection'' (2003) [[National Academies Press]]. p. 212</ref> These studies did show that specific-incident polygraph testing, in a person untrained in counter-measures, could discern the truth at \"a level greater than chance, yet short of perfection\". However, due to several flaws, the levels of accuracy shown in these studies \"are almost certainly higher than actual polygraph accuracy of specific-incident testing in the field\".<ref name=\"nap.edu\"/>\n\nWhen polygraphs are used as a screening tool (in [[national security]] matters and for [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] agencies for example) the level of accuracy drops to such a level that \"Its accuracy in distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers is insufficient to justify reliance on its use in employee security screening in [[List of federal agencies in the United States|federal agencies]].\"  The NAS concluded that the polygraph \"...may have some utility\"<ref name=\"nap.edu\"/> but that there is \"little basis for the expectation that a polygraph test could have extremely high accuracy.\"<ref name=\"nap.edu\">{{Cite journal |title= The Polygraph and Lie Detection |author= Board on Behavioral, Cognitive, and Sensory Sciences and Education (BCSSE) and Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT) |publisher= [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] |year= 2003 |url= http://www.nap.edu/books/0309084369/html/ |postscript= <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

During the interrogation the subject is supposed to carefully control their [[breathing]] while answering the relevant questions, and to try to artificially increase their [[heart rate]] during the control questions, for example by thinking of something scary or exciting, or by pricking themselves with a pointed object concealed somewhere on their body. In this way the results will not show a significant reaction to any of the relevant questions.<ref name=\"tremor\">Lykken, David T.

Jacob Sdovnik), ruled that as the polygraph has not been recognized as a reliable device. In other decisions, polygraph results were ruled inadmissible in criminal trials. It has not been clearly decided if polygraph results are inadmissible as evidence in a [[civil trial]].\n\nIn the private discipline, some insurance companies attempt to include a clause in insurance contracts, in which the beneficiary agrees that polygraph results be admissible as evidence. In such cases, where the beneficiary has willingly agreed to such a clause, signed the contract, and taken the test, the courts will honor the contract, and take the polygraph results into consideration. However, it is common practice for [[lawyer]]s to advise people who signed such contracts to refuse to take the test. Depending on whether or not the beneficiary signed an agreements clause, and whether the test was already taken or not, such a refusal usually has no ill effects; at worst, the court will simply order the person to take the test as agreed. At best, the court will cancel the clause and release the person from taking the test, or rule the evidence inadmissible.\n\n===Europe===\nIn most [[Europe]]an jurisdictions, polygraphs are not considered reliable evidence and are not generally used by law enforcement.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Courts themselves do not order or facilitate polygraph testing. In most cases, polygraph tests are voluntarily taken by a defendant in order to substantiate his or her defense.\n\n====Germany====\nThe [[Federal Court of Justice]] of Germany has ruled that polygraph evidence is inherently inconclusive and not admissible in court.

However, the [[New South Wales]] District Court rejected the use of the device in a criminal trial. In ''Raymond George Murray'' 1982 7A Crim R48 Sinclair DCJ refused to admit polygraph evidence tending to support the defense. The judge rejected the evidence because\n#The veracity of the accused and the weight to be given to his evidence, and other witnesses called in the trial, was a matter for the jury.\n#The polygraph \"expert\" sought to express an opinion as to ultimate facts in issue, which is peculiarly the province of the jury.\n#The test purported to be expert evidence by the witness who was not qualified as an expert, he was merely an operator and assessor of a polygraph. The scientific premise upon which his assessment was based had not been proved in any Court in Australia.\n#Devoid of any proved or accepted scientific basis, the evidence of the operator is [[hearsay]] which is inadmissible.\nThe Court cited, with approval, the Canadian case of ''Phillion v R'' 1978 1SCR 18.\n\nLie detector evidence is currently inadmissible in New South Wales courts under the ''Lie Detectors Act''. Under the same act, it is also illegal to use lie detectors for the purpose of granting employment, insurance, financial accommodation, and several other purposes for which lie detectors may be used in other jurisdictions.<ref>http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/maintop/view/inforce/act+62+1983+cd+0+N ''Lie Detectors Act 1983 (NSW)''</ref>\n\n==Security clearances==\nContrary to popular belief, a security clearance may not be revoked based solely on polygraph results.  However, a person's access to sensitive information may be denied if the polygraph results are not favorable. In addition, persons being considered for a government position or job may be denied the employment, if the position specifically requires successful completion of a polygraph examination. It is difficult to precisely determine the effectiveness of polygraph results for the detection or deterrence of spying. It is inadmissible as evidence in most federal courts and military courts martial. The polygraph is more often used as a deterrent to espionage rather than detection. One exception to this was the case of [[Harold James Nicholson]], a CIA employee later convicted of spying for [[Russia]]. In 1995, Nicholson had undergone his periodic five year reinvestigation where he showed a strong probability of deception on questions regarding relationships with a foreign intelligence unit. This polygraph test later launched an investigation which resulted in his eventual arrest and conviction. In most cases, however, polygraphs are more of a tool to \"scare straight\" those who would consider espionage. [[Jonathan Pollard]] was advised by his Israeli handlers that he was to resign his job from American intelligence if he was ever told he was subject to a polygraph test.  Likewise, [[John Anthony Walker]] was advised by his handlers not to engage in espionage until he had been promoted to the highest position for which a polygraph test was not required, to refuse promotion to higher positions for which polygraph tests were required, and to retire when promotion was mandated.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=USg-j9esZagC|title=The polygraph and lie detection|author=Committee to Review the Scientific Evidence on the Polygraph (National Research Council (US)), Mark Harrison Moore|year=2002 | isbn=978-0-309-08436-9 | publisher=National Academies Press}}</ref>  As part of his [[plea bargain]] agreement for his case of espionage for the [[Soviet Union]] [[Robert Hanssen]] would be made to undergo a polygraph at any time as a means of damage assessment. In Hanssen's 25-year career with the [[FBI]], not once was he made to undergo a polygraph.\n\nAlternatively, the use of polygraph testing, where it causes desperation over dismissal for past dishonesty, may encourage spying.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} For example, [[Edward Lee Howard]] was dismissed from the CIA when, during a polygraph screening, he truthfully answered a series of questions admitting to minor crimes such as petty theft and drug abuse. In retaliation for his perceived unjust punishment for minor offenses, he later sold his knowledge of CIA operations to the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peacecorpsonline.org/messages/messages/2629/1008570.html|title=RPCV and CIA defector Edward Howard dies in Moscow|date=2002-07-22|publisher=Peace Corps Online}}</ref>\n\nIt is also worth noting that polygraph tests may not deter espionage. From 1945 to the present, at least six Americans have committed espionage while successfully passing polygraph tests. Notable cases of two men who created a false negative result with the polygraphs were [[Larry Wu-Tai Chin]] and [[Aldrich Ames]]. Ames was given two polygraph examinations while with the CIA, the first in 1986 and the second in 1991. The CIA reported that he passed both examinations after experiencing initial indications of deception.<ref>[http://www.loyola.edu/dept/politics/intel/hitzrept.html The Adrich H. Ames Case: An Assessment of CIA's Role, Oct. 21, 1994 Memorandum for Heads of Agency Offices from Director of Central Intelligence]</ref> According to a Senate investigation, an FBI review of the first examination concluded that the indications of deception were never resolved.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/congress/1994_rpt/ssci_ames.htm|title=An Assessment of the Aldrich H.

The second examiner concluded that there were no further indications of deception. In the CIA's analysis of the second exam, they were critical of their failure to convey to the second examiner the existing suspicions. Ana Belen Montes, a Cuban spy, passed a counterintelligence scope polygraph test administered by DIA in 1994.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/feature/wp/2013/04/18/ana-montes-did-much-harm-spying-for-cuba-chances-are-you-havent-heard-of-her/ | work=The Washington Post | title=Magazine}}</ref>\n\nDespite these errors, in August 2008, the US [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] announced that it would subject each of its 5,700 prospective and current employees to polygraph testing at least once annually.<ref name=\"Hess, Pamela 2008\">Hess, Pamela, \"Pentagon's Intelligence Arm Steps Up Lie-Detector Efforts\", ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'', August 24, 2008.

However, there have been no empirical theories established to explain how a polygraph measures deception.  Recent research indicates that [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (fMRI) may benefit in explaining the psychological correlations of polygraph exams.  It could also explain which parts of the brain are active when subjects use artificial memories.{{clarify |date=October 2016 |reason=What is an artificial memory?}}<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = B.

However, fMRIs are limited by being expensive, immobile, and having inconsistent lying responses. Some researchers believe that [[mental chronometry|reaction time]] (RT) based tests may replace polygraphs in concealed information detection.  RT based tests differ from polygraphs in stimulus presentation duration, and can be conducted without physiological recording as subject response time is measured via computer.  However, researchers have found limitations to these tests as subjects voluntarily control their reaction time, deception can still occur within the response deadline, and the test itself lacks physiological recording.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Verschuere | first1 = B. | last2 = Crombez | first2 = G. | last3 = Degrootte | first3 = T. | last4 = Rosseel | first4 = Y. | year = 2010 | title = Detecting concealed information with reaction times: Validity and comparison with the polygraph | url = | journal = Applied Cognitive Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 7| pages = 991\u2013100 | doi=10.1002/acp.1601}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nEarlier societies utilized elaborate methods of lie detection which mainly involved [[torture]]; for instance, the Middle Ages used boiling water to detect liars as it was believed honest men would withstand it better than liars.<ref name=\"Grubin, D. 2005\">{{cite journal | last1 = Grubin | first1 = D. | last2 = Madsen | first2 = L. | year = 2005 | title = Lie detection and the polygraph: A historical review | url = | journal = Journal of Forensic Psychiatry and Psychology | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 357\u2013369 | doi=10.1080/14789940412331337353}}</ref> Early devices for lie detection include an 1895 invention of [[Cesare Lombroso]] used to measure changes in blood pressure for police cases, a 1904 device by [[Vittorio Benussi]] used to measure breathing, and an abandoned project by American [[William Moulton Marston]] which used blood pressure to examine German prisoners of war (POWs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nitv1.com/History.htm|title=History of CVSA|work=nitv1.com}}</ref> Marston\u2019s machine indicated a strong positive [[#correlation and dependence|correlation]] between systolic blood pressure and lying.<ref name=\"Lewis, J.

Notable instances of polygraph usage include uses in crime and espionage themed television shows and some [[daytime television]] talk shows, cartoons and films. The most notable polygraph TV show is ''[[Lie Detector (TV series)|Lie Detector]]'', which first aired in the 1950s created and hosted by [[Ralph Andrews]]. In the 1960s Andrews produced a series of specials hosted by [[Melvin Belli]]. In the 1970s the show was hosted by Jack Anderson. In 1998 TV producer Mark Phillips with his Mark Phillips Philms & Telephision put ''Lie Detector'' back on the air on the FOX Network\u2014on that program Dr. Ed Gelb with host [[Marcia Clark]] questioned [[Mark Fuhrman]] about the allegation that he \"planted the bloody glove\". Later Phillips produced ''Lie Detector'' as a series for PAX/ION\u2014some of the guests included [[Paula Jones]], Reverend [[Paul Crouch]] accuser Lonny Ford, Ben Rowling, [[Jeff Gannon]] and [[Swift Vets and POWs for Truth|Swift Boat Vet]], Steve Garner.\n\nFOX has taken this one step further with their game show ''[[The Moment of Truth (US game show)|The Moment of Truth]]'', which pits people's honesty against their own sense of modesty, propriety and other values. Contestants are given a polygraph test administered by a polygraph expert in a pre-screening session during which they answer over 50 questions. Later, they must sit in front of a studio audience that including their friends and family for the televised portion of the show. They need only answer 21 answers truthfully \"as determined by the polygraph\" to win $500,000. The questions get more personal or revealing as they advance. Most polygraph experts caution that the techniques used on ''Moment of Truth'' do not conform to accepted methods of polygraphy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nDaytime talk shows, such as [[Maury Povich]] and [[Steve Wilkos]], frequently used polygraphs to attempt to determine if someone was cheating on their significant other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/176031-thetruth-about-maury/|title=The Tested Truth About 'Maury Povich'|last=O'Dell|first=Cary|date=November 12, 2013|work=Pop Matters|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref> \n\nIn one ''[[MacGyver]]'' episode 'Slow Death', MacGyver assists the Indian tribesmen by improvising a polygraph to weed out the crooked doctor. This is made possible by using an analog [[sphygmomanometer]] to monitor blood pressure change, and an electronic alarm clock to detect sweat. To test its reliability, MacGyver asked a passenger on the train a few \"placebo\" questions. The culprit was only discovered when he was trying to hide his crime, thus his sweat triggered the alarm clock and blood pressure climbed up.\n\nIn the movie ''[[Harsh Times]]'' the protagonist, played by actor [[Christian Bale]], is caught trying to \"beat\" a polygraph test during a pre-employment screening for a federal law enforcement job. He stores a tack in the toe of his shoe and uses the pain sensation to mask his true apprehension of certain questions. The polygrapher is immediately suspicious and threatens to terminate the test.\n\nIn the movie ''[[Ocean's 13]]'', one of the characters beats a polygraph test by stepping on a tack when answering truthfully, which supposedly raises the polygraph's readings for the truthful answers so they equal the deceptive ones.\n\nIn the television series ''[[Profit (TV series)|Profit]]'', there is a memorable sequence at the end of episode \"Healing\" where the eponymous character, Jim Profit, manages to fool a polygraph. He does that by putting a nail through the sole of his shoe and pushing it inside of his heel while answering every question in order to even out the readings. This scene is very graphic, especially for its time, 1996. During a voice-over, Profit explains the theory behind the polygraph and the flaws he intends to exploit in it.\n\nIn the 20th episode of ''[[The Americans (2013 TV series)|The Americans]]'', \"[[Arpanet (The Americans)|Arpanet]]\", Nina, a [[KGB]] [[double agent]], misleads her FBI handler after receiving coaching on how to beat the polygraph from Oleg, her Soviet superior. Oleg describes the machine as being similar to a camera in that it doesn't know if the subject's smiles convey genuine happiness. He also uses the [[Asp (reptile)|asp]] killing [[Cleopatra]] as a metaphor, stating it only killed her when she moved. One technique suggested to Nina is visualizing her KGB superior in the room, as well as clenching her anus. She appears to utilize and benefit from these techniques as she passes the test.\n\nIn episode 93 of the USA popular science show ''[[MythBusters]]'', they attempted to fool the polygraph by using pain to try to increase the readings when answering truthfully (so the machine will supposedly interpret the truthful and non-truthful answers as the same.) They also attempted to fool the polygraph by thinking happy thoughts when lying and thinking stressful thoughts when telling the truth to try to confuse the machine. However, neither technique was successful for a number of reasons. Michael Martin correctly identified each guilty and innocent subject. The show also noted the opinion that, when done properly, polygraphs are correct 80\u201399% of the time.<ref>For critical commentary on this episode, see {{cite web | last=Maschke|first=George|title=Mythbusters Beat the Lie Detector Episode featuring Michael Martin|publisher=AntiPolygraph.org|date=7 December 2007|url=https://antipolygraph.org/cgi-bin/forums/YaBB.pl?num=1197009999}}</ref>\n\n===Hand-held lie detector for U.S. military===\nA hand-held lie detector is being deployed by the U.S. Department of Defense according to a report in 2008 by investigative reporter [[Bill Dedman]] of [[MSNBC]]. The Preliminary Credibility Assessment Screening System, or PCASS, captures less physiological information than a polygraph, and uses an algorithm, not the judgment of a polygraph examiner, to render a decision whether it believes the person is being deceptive or not. The device will be used first in Afghanistan by U.S. Army troops. The Department of Defense ordered its use be limited to non-U.S. persons, in overseas locations only.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Bill|last=Dedman|date=April 9, 2008|title=New anti-terror weapon: Hand-held lie detector|publisher=Msnbc.com|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23926278}}</ref>\n\n===Notable cases===\nPolygraphy has been faulted for failing to trap known [[Espionage|spies]] such as double-agent [[Aldrich Ames]], who passed two polygraph tests while spying for the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Hess, Pamela 2008\"/><ref>Ames provides personal insight into the U.S. Government's reliance on polygraphy in a 2000 letter to Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists.{{cite journal|first=Aldrich|last=Ames|authorlink=Aldrich Ames|date=November 28, 2000|title=A Letter from Aldrich Ames on Polygraph Testing|journal=Federation of American Scientists|url=https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/polygraph/ames.html}}</ref> However Ames did fail several tests while at the CIA that were never acted on.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/08/opinion/spies-lies-averted-eyes.html</ref> Other spies who passed the polygraph include [[Karl Koecher]],<ref name=\"karl\">Kessler, Ron. \"Moscow's Mole in the CIA: How a Swinging Czech Superspy Stole America's Most Sensitive Secrets\", ''Washington Post'', April 17, 1988, C1.</ref> [[Ana Montes|Ana Belen Montes]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Bachelet|first=Pablo|title=Book outlines how spy exposed U.S. intelligence secrets to Cuba|publisher=McClatchy Washington Bureau|date=October 13, 2006|url=http://www.realcities.com/mld/krwashington/15754464.htm}} \"She first came under U.S. suspicion in 1994, when Cuba detected a highly secret electronic surveillance system.
