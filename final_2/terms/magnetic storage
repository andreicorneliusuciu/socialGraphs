Magnetic storage uses different patterns of [[magnetisation]] in a magnetisable material to store data and is a form of [[non-volatile memory]].  The information is accessed using one or more [[disk read-and-write head|read/write heads]].\n\n{{As of|2013}}, magnetic storage media, primarily [[Hard disk drive|hard disk]]s, are widely used to store [[Data (computing)|computer data]] as well as [[sound|audio]] and [[video]] signals. In the field of computing, the term ''magnetic storage'' is preferred and in the field of audio and video production, the term ''magnetic recording'' is more commonly used. The distinction is less technical and more a matter of preference.  Other examples of magnetic storage media include [[floppy disk]]s, magnetic [[recording tape]], and [[magnetic stripe card|magnetic stripes]] on credit cards.\n\n== History ==\n''[[Magnetic]]'' storage in the form of [[wire recording]]\u2014audio recording on a wire\u2014was publicized by [[Oberlin Smith]] in the Sept 8, 1888 issue of the ''Electrical World''.  Smith had previously filed a patent in September, 1878 but found no opportunity to pursue the idea as his business was machine tools.  The first publicly demonstrated (Paris Exposition of 1900)  magnetic recorder was invented by [[Valdemar Poulsen]] in 1898. Poulsen's device recorded a [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] on a wire wrapped around a drum. In 1928, [[Fritz Pfleumer]] developed the first magnetic [[tape recorder]]. Early magnetic storage devices were designed to record [[Analog signal|analog]] audio signals. Computers and now most audio and video magnetic storage devices record [[digital data]].\n\nIn old computers, magnetic storage was also used for [[primary storage]] in a form of [[magnetic drum]], or [[core memory]], [[core rope memory]], [[thin film memory]], [[twistor memory]] or [[bubble memory]]. Unlike modern computers, magnetic tape was also often used for secondary storage.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Laptop-hard-drive-exposed.jpg|thumb|right|Hard drives use magnetic memory to store giga- and terabytes of data in computers.]]\nInformation is written to and read from the storage medium as it moves past devices called [[disk read-and-write head|read-and-write head]]s that operate very close (often tens of nanometers) over the magnetic surface. The read-and-write head is used to detect and modify the magnetisation of the material immediately under it.  There are two magnetic polarities, each of which is used to represent either 0 or 1.\n\nThe magnetic surface is conceptually divided into many small sub-[[micrometer]]-sized magnetic regions, referred to as magnetic domains, (although these are not [[magnetic domains]] in a rigorous physical sense), each of which has a mostly uniform magnetisation. Due to the [[polycrystal]]line nature of the magnetic material each of these magnetic regions is composed of a few hundred magnetic [[crystallite|grains]]. Magnetic grains are typically 10&nbsp;nm in size and each form a single true [[Magnetic domains|magnetic domain]]. Each magnetic region in total forms a [[magnetic dipole]] which generates a [[magnetic field]]. In older [[hard disk drive]] (HDD) designs the regions were oriented horizontally and parallel to the disk surface, but beginning about 2005, the orientation was changed to [[perpendicular recording|perpendicular]] to allow for closer magnetic domain spacing.\n\nFor reliable storage of data, the recording material needs to resist self-demagnetisation, which occurs when the magnetic domains repel each other. Magnetic domains written too densely together to a weakly magnetisable material will degrade over time due to rotation of the [[magnetic moment]] one or more domains to cancel out these forces. The domains rotate sideways to a halfway position that weakens the readability of the domain and relieves the magnetic stresses. Older hard disk drives used [[iron(III) oxide]] as the magnetic material, but current disks use a [[cobalt]]-based alloy.<ref name=\"AutoMK-13\"/>\n\nA write head magnetises a region by generating a strong local magnetic field, and a read head detects the magnetisation of the regions. Early HDDs used an [[electromagnet]] both to magnetise the region and to then read its magnetic field by using [[electromagnetic induction]]. Later versions of inductive heads included Metal In Gap (MIG) heads and [[thin film]] heads. As data density increased, read heads using [[magnetoresistance]] (MR) came into use; the electrical resistance of the head changed according to the strength of the magnetism from the platter. Later development made use of [[spintronics]]; in read heads, the magnetoresistive effect was much greater than in earlier types, and was dubbed [[giant magnetoresistance|\"giant\" magnetoresistance]] (GMR). In today's heads, the read and write elements are separate, but in close proximity, on the head portion of an actuator arm. The read element is typically [[giant magnetoresistance|magneto-resistive]] while the write element is typically thin-film inductive.<ref name=\"AutoMK-14\"/>\n\nThe heads are kept from contacting the platter surface by the air that is extremely close to the platter; that air moves at or near the platter speed. The record and playback head are mounted on a block called a slider, and the surface next to the platter is shaped to keep it just barely out of contact. This forms a type of [[air bearing]].\n\n== Magnetic recording classes ==\n\n=== Analog recording ===\n{{main|Magnetic tape sound recording}}\n\n[[Analog recording]] is based on the fact that remnant magnetisation of a given material depends on the magnitude of the applied field. The magnetic material is normally in the form of tape, with the tape in its blank form being initially demagnetised. When recording, the tape runs at a constant speed. The writing head magnetises the tape with current proportional to the signal. A magnetisation distribution is achieved along the magnetic tape. Finally, the distribution of the magnetisation can be read out, reproducing the original signal. The magnetic tape is typically made by embedding magnetic particles in a plastic binder on polyester film tape. The commonly used magnetic particles are Iron oxide particles or Chromium oxide and metal particles with size of 0.5 micrometers.<ref name=\"AutoLQ-1\"/> Analog recording was the most popular method of audio and video recording. In the past 20 years, however, tape recording has declined in popularity due to digital recording.<ref name=\"AutoLQ-2\"/>\n\n=== Digital recording ===\n\nInstead of creating a magnetisation distribution in analog recording, [[digital recording]] only needs two stable magnetic states, which are the +Ms and -Ms on the [[Hysteresis|hysteresis loop]]. Examples of digital recording are [[floppy disk]]s and [[hard disk drive]]s (HDDs). Digital recording has also been carried out on tapes. However, HDDs offer superior capacities at reasonable prices; at the time of writing (2014), consumer-grade HDDs offer data storage at about 3&nbsp;GB/$.\n\nRecording media on HDDs use a stack of thin films to store information and a read/write head to read and write information to and from the media; various developments have been carried out in the area of used materials.<ref>[http://as.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470501006.html Developments in Data Storage, ed. S.N. Piramanayagam and Tow C. Chong, IEEE-Wiley Press (2012).]</ref>\n\n=== Magneto-optical recording ===\n\nMagneto-optical recording writes/reads optically. When writing, the magnetic medium is heated locally by a [[laser]], which induces a rapid decrease of coercive field. Then, a small magnetic field can be used to switch the magnetisation. The reading process is based on magneto-optical [[Kerr effect]]. The magnetic medium are typically amorphous R-FeCo thin film (R being a rare earth element). Magneto-optical recording is not very popular. One famous example is [[MiniDisc|Minidisc]] developed by [[Sony]].\n\n=== Domain propagation memory ===\n\nDomain propagation memory is also called [[bubble memory]]. The basic idea is to control domain wall motion in a magnetic medium that is free of microstructure. Bubble refers to a stable cylindrical domain. Data is then recorded by the presence/absence of a bubble domain. Domain propagation memory has high insensitivity to shock and vibration, so its application is usually in space and aeronautics.\n\n== Technical details ==\n\n=== Access method ===\n\nMagnetic storage media can be classified as either [[sequential access memory]] or [[random access memory]], although in some cases the distinction is not perfectly clear. The access time can be defined as the average time needed to gain access to stored records. In the case of magnetic wire, the read/write head only covers a very small part of the recording surface at any given time.  Accessing different parts of the wire involves winding the wire forward or backward until the point of interest is found.  The time to access this point depends on how far away it is from the starting point.  The case of ferrite-core memory is the opposite.  Every core location is immediately accessible at any given time.\n\nHard disks and modern linear serpentine tape drives do not precisely fit into either category.  Both have many parallel tracks across the width of the media and the read/write heads take time to switch between tracks and to scan within tracks.  Different spots on the storage media take different amounts of time to access.  For a hard disk this time is typically less than 10 ms, but tapes might take as much as 100 s.\n\n== Current usage ==\n\n{{As of|2011}}, common uses of magnetic storage media are for computer data mass storage on hard disks and the recording of analog audio and video works on [[Magnetic tape|analog tape]]. Since much of audio and video production is moving to digital systems, the usage of hard disks is expected to increase at the expense of analog tape. [[Magnetic tape data storage|Digital tape]] and [[tape library|tape libraries]] are popular for the high capacity data storage of archives and backups. [[Floppy disk]]s see some marginal usage, particularly in dealing with older computer systems and software. Magnetic storage is also widely used in some specific applications, such as bank [[cheques]] ([[MICR]]) and credit/debit cards ([[magnetic stripe card|mag stripes]]).\n\n== Future ==\nA new type of magnetic storage, called [[magnetoresistive random-access memory]] or MRAM, is being produced that stores [[data]] in magnetic bits based on the [[tunnel magnetoresistance]] (TMR) effect. Its advantage is non-volatility, low power usage, and good shock robustness.  The 1st generation that was developed was produced by [[Freescale Semiconductor|Everspin Technologies]], and utilized field induced writing.<ref name=\"AutoLQ-3\"/>  The 2nd generation is being developed through two approaches: [[thermal-assisted switching]] (TAS)<ref name=\"AutoLQ-4\"/> which is currently being developed by [[Crocus Technology]], and [[spin-transfer torque]] (STT) on which [[Crocus Technology|Crocus]], [[Hynix]], [[IBM]], and several other companies are working.<ref name=\"AutoLQ-5\"/>  However, with storage density and capacity orders of magnitude smaller than an [[Hard Disk|HDD]], MRAM is useful in applications where moderate amounts of storage with a need for very frequent updates are required, which [[flash memory]] cannot support due to its limited write endurance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Six state MRAM is also being developed, echoing four bit multi level flash memory cells, that have six different bits, as opposed to [[Binary number|two]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-05-six-state-magnetic-memory.html|title=Researchers design six-state magnetic memory|website=phys.org|access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Digital Audio Tape]]\n* [[Digital Data Storage]]\n* [[Heat-assisted magnetic recording]]\n* [[Karlqvist gap]]\n* [[Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory]]\n* [[Marvin Camras]]\n* [[Shingled magnetic recording]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"AutoLQ-1\">{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/audio/tape2.html |title=Magnetic Tape Recording |publisher=Hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoLQ-2\">E. du Tr\u00e9molete de Lacheisserie, D.
