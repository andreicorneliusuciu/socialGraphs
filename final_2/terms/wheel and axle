A [[hinge]] or [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] supports the axle, allowing rotation.  It can amplify force; a small force applied to the periphery of the large wheel can move a larger load attached to the axle.\n\nGreek philosophers such as [[Hero of Alexandria]] first identified the wheel and axle as one of the simple machines used to lift weights.<ref name=\"Usher\">{{cite book   \n  | last = Usher\n  | first = Abbott Payson \n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = A History of Mechanical Inventions\n  | publisher = Courier Dover Publications\n  | year = 1988\n  | location = USA\n  | pages = 98\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xuDDqqa8FlwC&pg=PA196#v=snippet&q=wedge%20and%20screw&f=false\n  | doi = \n  | isbn = 048625593X}}</ref>  This is thought to have been in the form of the [[windlass]] which consists of a crank or pulley connected to a cylindrical barrel that provides mechanical advantage to wind up a rope and lift a load such as a bucket from the well.<ref>Elroy McKendree Avery, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QOYXAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA459&lpg=PA459&dq=Elroy+McKendree+Avery,+Elementary+Physics,+New+York+:+Sheldon+%26+Company,+1878.&source=bl&ots=JgvusHHikF&sig=a95N9DzqdzSPGoel0m3TskK_sm8&hl=en&ei=iv7jTs3LFc-asgLnvNHzBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=wheel%20and%20axle&f=false Elementary Physics], New York : Sheldon & Company, 1878.</ref>\n\nThe wheel and axle can be viewed as a version of the [[lever]], with a drive force applied tangentially to the perimeter of the wheel and a load force applied to the axle, respectively, that are balanced around the hinge which is the fulcrum. The [[mechanical advantage]] of the wheel and axle is the ratio of the distances from the fulcrum to the applied loads, or what is the same thing the ratio of the diameter of the wheel and axle.<ref name=\"Bowser\">Bowser, Edward Albert, 1890, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UdM3AAAAMAAJ&pg=PR9&dq=wheel+and+axle&hl=en&ei=w_xBTdD9IMzOgAf0tbDVAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CGAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=wheel%20and%20axle&f=false  An elementary treatise on analytic mechanics: with numerous examples.]   (Originally from the University of Michigan) D.

A tangential force applied to the periphery of the large disk can exert a larger force on a load attached to the axle, achieving [[mechanical advantage]].  When used as the [[wheel]] of a [[wheeled vehicle]] the smaller cylinder is the axle of the wheel, but when used in a [[windlass]], [[winch]], and other similar applications (see medieval mining lift to right) the smaller cylinder may be separate from the axle mounted in the bearings. It cannot be used separately.<ref>Prater, Edward L. (1994), [http://www.constructionknowledge.net/public_domain_documents/Div_1_General/Basic_Skills/Basic%20Machines%20NAVEDTRA%2014037%201994.pdf Basic Machines], Naval Education and Training Professional Development and Technology Center, NAVEDTRA 14037</ref><ref>Bureau of Naval Personnel, 1971, [http://www.webpal.org/SAFE/aaarecovery/5_simple_technology/basic_machines.pdf Basic Machines and How They Work], Dover Publications.</ref>\n\nAssuming the wheel and axle does not dissipate or store energy, that is it has no [[friction]] or [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], the [[power (physics)|power]] input by the force applied to the wheel must equal the power output at the axle.  As the wheel and axle system rotates around its bearings, points on the circumference, or edge, of the wheel move faster than points on the circumference, or edge, of the axle! Therefore, a force applied to the edge of the wheel must be less than the force applied to the edge of the axle, because power is the product of force and velocity.<ref>J. J. Uicker, G. R. Pennock, and J. E. Shigley, 2003, '''Theory of Machines and Mechanisms,''' Oxford University Press, New York.</ref>\n\nLet ''a'' and ''b'' be the distances from the center of the bearing to the edges of the wheel ''A'' and the axle ''B.''   If the input force ''F<sub>A</sub>'' is applied to the edge of the wheel ''A'' and the force ''F<sub>B</sub>'' at the edge of the axle ''B'' is the output, then the  ratio of the velocities of points ''A'' and ''B'' is given by ''a/b'', so  the ratio of the output force to the input force, or [[mechanical advantage]], is given by\n:<math>MA = \\frac{F_B}{F_A} = \\frac{a}{b}.</math>\n\nThe mechanical advantage of a simple machine like the wheel and axle is computed as the ratio of the resistance to the effort. The larger the ratio the greater the multiplication of force (torque) created or distance achieved. By varying the radii of the axle and/or wheel, any amount of mechanical advantage may be gained.<ref name=\"Bowser\"/>  In this manner, the size of the wheel may be increased to an inconvenient extent.  In this case a system or combination of wheels (often toothed, that is, [[gear]]s) are used.  As a wheel and axle is a type of lever, a system of wheels and axles is like a compound lever.<ref>Baker, C.E.
