They are multicellular organisms that have bodies full of pores and channels allowing water to circulate through them, consisting of jelly-like [[mesohyl]] sandwiched between two thin layers of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s.\nSponges have unspecialized cells that can [[cellular differentiation|transform into other types]] and that often migrate between the main cell layers and the mesohyl in the process. Sponges do not have [[nervous system|nervous]], [[digestive system|digestive]] or [[circulatory system]]s. Instead, most rely on maintaining a constant water flow through their bodies to obtain food and oxygen and to remove wastes.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Reef3859 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|right|Sponge [[biodiversity]] and [[morphotype]]s at the lip of a wall site in 60 feet of water. Included are the yellow tube sponge, ''[[Aplysina fistularis]]'', the purple vase sponge, ''[[Niphates digitalis]]'', the red encrusting sponge, ''[[Spiratrella coccinea]]'', and the gray rope sponge, ''[[Callyspongia]]'' sp.]]\n\nSponges are similar to other animals in that they are [[multicellular]], [[heterotrophic]], lack [[cell wall]]s and produce [[sperm cell]]s. Unlike other animals, they lack true [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], and have no [[body symmetry]]. The shapes of their bodies are adapted for maximal efficiency of water flow through the central cavity, where it deposits nutrients, and leaves through a hole called the [[osculum]]. Many sponges have internal skeletons of [[spongin]] and/or spicules of [[calcium carbonate]] or [[silicon dioxide]]. All sponges are [[Sessility (motility)|sessile]] aquatic animals. Although there are freshwater species, the great majority are marine (salt water) species, ranging from tidal zones to depths exceeding {{convert|8800|m|mi|abbr=on}}.\n\nWhile most of the approximately 5,000\u201310,000&nbsp;known species feed on [[bacteria]] and other food particles in the water, some host [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] micro-organisms as [[endosymbiont]]s and these alliances often produce more food and oxygen than they consume. A few species of sponge that live in food-poor environments have become [[carnivore]]s that prey mainly  on small [[crustacean]]s.{{sfn|Vacelet|Duport|2004|pp=179\u2013190}}\n\nMost species use [[sexual reproduction]], releasing [[sperm]] cells into the water to fertilize [[ovum|ova]] that in some species are released and in others are retained by the \"mother\". The fertilized eggs form [[larva]]e which swim off in search of places to settle.{{sfn|Bergquist|1978|pp=183\u2013185}} Sponges are known for regenerating from fragments that are broken off, although this only works if the fragments include the right types of cells. A few species reproduce by budding. When conditions deteriorate, for example as temperatures drop, many freshwater species and a few marine ones produce [[gemmule]]s, \"survival pods\" of unspecialized cells that remain dormant until conditions improve and then either form completely new sponges or recolonize the skeletons of their parents.{{sfn|Bergquist|1978|pp=120\u2013127}}\n\nThe mesohyl functions as an [[endoskeleton]] in most sponges, and is the only skeleton in soft sponges that encrust hard surfaces such as rocks. More commonly, the mesohyl is stiffened by [[Biomineralization|mineral]] [[sponge spicule|spicules]], by [[spongin]] fibers or both. [[Demosponge]]s use spongin, and in many species, [[silica]] spicules and in some species, [[calcium carbonate]] [[exoskeleton]]s. Demosponges constitute about 90% of all known sponge species, including all freshwater ones, and have the widest range of habitats. [[Calcareous sponge]]s, which have calcium carbonate spicules and, in some species, calcium carbonate exoskeletons, are restricted to relatively shallow marine waters where production of calcium carbonate is easiest.{{sfn|Bergquist|1978|p=179}} The fragile [[glass sponge]]s, with \"[[scaffolding]]\" of silica spicules, are restricted to polar regions and the ocean depths where predators are rare. Fossils of all of these types have been found in rocks dated from {{ma|580}}. In addition [[Archaeocyathid]]s, whose fossils are common in rocks from {{ma|530|490}}, are now regarded as a type of sponge.\n\nThe [[unicellular|single-celled]] [[choanoflagellate]]s resemble the choanocyte cells of sponges which are used to drive their water flow systems and capture most of their food. This along with phylogenetic studies of ribosomal molecules have been used as morphological evidence to suggest sponges are the sister group to the rest of animals.<ref name=\"collins 1998\">{{Cite journal | author = A.

By the 1950s, though, these had been [[overfishing|overfished]] so heavily that the industry almost collapsed, and most sponge-like materials are now synthetic. Sponges and their microscopic endosymbionts are now being researched as possible sources of medicines for treating a wide range of diseases. [[Dolphin]]s have been observed using sponges as tools while foraging.<ref name=\"Krutzen 2005\"/>\n\n==Distinguishing features==\n{{Further|Cnidaria|Ctenophore}}\nSponges constitute the [[phylum]] Porifera, and have been defined as [[Sessility (motility)|sessile]] [[metazoa]]ns (multicelled immobile animals) that have water intake and outlet openings connected by chambers lined with [[choanocyte]]s, cells with whip-like flagella.{{sfn|Bergquist|1978|p=29}} However, a few carnivorous sponges have lost these water flow systems and the choanocytes.{{sfn|Bergquist|1978|p=39}}<ref name=\"HooperVanSoestDebrenne2002PhylumPorifera\">{{cite book|author=Hooper, J.

The inner surface is covered with [[choanocyte]]s, cells with cylindrical or conical collars surrounding one [[flagellum]] per choanocyte. The wave-like motion of the whip-like flagella drives water through the sponge's body. All sponges have '''ostia''', channels leading to the interior through the mesohyl, and in most sponges these are controlled by tube-like [[porocytes]] that form closable inlet valves. [[Pinacocyte]]s, plate-like cells, form a single-layered external skin over all other parts of the mesohyl that are not covered by choanocytes, and the pinacocytes also digest food particles that are too large to enter the ostia,<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004Porifera\"/><ref name=\"Bergquist2001PoriferaInAnderson\"/> while those at the base of the animal are responsible for anchoring it.<ref name=\"Bergquist2001PoriferaInAnderson\"/>\n\nOther types of cell live and move within the mesohyl:<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004Porifera\"/><ref name=\"Bergquist2001PoriferaInAnderson\"/>\n*[[Lophocyte]]s are [[amoeba]]-like cells that move slowly through the mesohyl and secrete collagen fibres.\n*[[Collencyte]]s are another type of collagen-producing cell.\n*[[Rhabdiferous]] cells secrete [[polysaccharide]]s that also form part of the mesohyl.\n*[[Oocyte]]s and [[spermatocyte]]s are reproductive cells.\n*[[Sclerocyte]]s secrete the mineralized [[sponge spicule|spicules]] (\"little spines\") that form the [[skeleton]]s of many sponges and in some species provide some defense against predators.\n*In addition to or instead of sclerocytes, [[demosponge]]s have [[spongocyte]]s that secrete a form of collagen that [[polymer]]izes into [[spongin]], a thick fibrous material that stiffens the mesohyl.\n*[[Myocyte]]s (\"muscle cells\") conduct signals and cause parts of the animal to contract.\n*\"Grey cells\" act as sponges' equivalent of an [[immune system]].\n*[[Archaeocytes]] (or [[amoebocytes]]) are [[amoeba]]-like cells that are [[totipotent]], in other words each is capable of transformation into any other type of cell. They also have important roles in feeding and in clearing debris that block the ostia.\n\n===Glass sponges' syncytia===\n{{Annotated image/Euplectella|float=left}}\n[[Glass sponge]]s present a distinctive variation on this basic plan. Their spicules, which are made of [[silica]], form a [[scaffolding]]-like framework between whose rods the living tissue is suspended like a [[Spider web|cobweb]] that contains most of the cell types.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004Porifera\"/> This tissue is a [[syncytium]] that in some ways behaves like many cells that share a single external [[Cell membrane|membrane]], and in others like a single cell with multiple [[cell nucleus|nuclei]]. The mesohyl is absent or minimal. The syncytium's [[cytoplasm]], the soupy fluid that fills the interiors of cells, is organized into \"rivers\" that transport nuclei, [[organelle]]s (\"organs\" within cells) and other substances.<ref name=\"Leys2003SignificanceOfSyncytialTissues\">{{cite journal|author= Leys, S. P.|title=The significance of syncytial tissues for the position of the Hexactinellida in the Metazoa|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|issue=1|doi=10.1093/icb/43.1.19|pages=19\u201327 |year=2003|volume=43|pmid=21680406}}</ref> Instead of choanocytes, they have further syncytia, known as choanosyncytia, which form bell-shaped chambers where water enters via perforations. The insides of these chambers are lined with \"collar bodies\", each consisting of a collar and flagellum but without a nucleus of its own. The motion of the flagella sucks water through passages in the \"cobweb\" and expels it via the open ends of the bell-shaped chambers.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004Porifera\"/>\n\nSome types of cells have a single nucleus and membrane each, but are connected to other single-nucleus cells and to the main syncytium by \"bridges\" made of [[cytoplasm]]. The [[sclerocyte]]s that build spicules have multiple nuclei, and in glass sponge larvae they are connected to other tissues by cytoplasm bridges; such connections between sclerocytes have not so far been found in adults, but this may simply reflect the difficulty of investigating such small-scale features. The bridges are controlled by \"plugged junctions\" that apparently permit some substances to pass while blocking others.<ref name=\"Leys2003SignificanceOfSyncytialTissues\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Water flow and body structures===\n{{Annotated image/Porifera body structures}}\nMost sponges work rather like [[chimney]]s: they take in water at the bottom and eject it from the [[osculum]] (\"little mouth\") at the top. Since ambient currents are faster at the top, the suction effect that they produce by [[Bernoulli's principle]] does some of the work for free. Sponges can control the water flow by various combinations of wholly or partially closing the osculum and ostia (the intake pores) and varying the beat of the flagella, and may shut it down if there is a lot of sand or silt in the water.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004Porifera\"/>\n\nAlthough the layers of [[pinacocyte]]s and [[choanocyte]]s resemble the [[epithelia]] of more complex animals, they are not bound tightly by cell-to-cell connections or a basal lamina (thin fibrous sheet underneath). The flexibility of these layers and re-modeling of the mesohyl by lophocytes allow the animals to adjust their shapes throughout their lives to take maximum advantage of local water currents.{{sfn|Ruppert|Fox|Barnes|2004|p=83}}\n\nThe simplest body structure in sponges is a tube or vase shape known as \"asconoid\", but this severely limits the size of the animal. The body structure is characterized by a stalk-like spongocoel surrounded by a single layer of choanocytes. If it is simply scaled up, the ratio of its volume to surface area increases, because surface increases as the square of length or width while volume increases proportionally to the cube. The amount of tissue that needs food and [[oxygen]] is determined by the volume, but the pumping capacity that supplies food and oxygen depends on the area covered by choanocytes. Asconoid sponges seldom exceed {{convert|1|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004Porifera\"/>\n\n{{Plain image with caption|Sea sponge diagram.svg|Diagram of a syconoid sponge.|250px|left}}\n\nSome sponges overcome this limitation by adopting the \"syconoid\" structure, in which the body wall is [[pleat]]ed. The inner pockets of the pleats are lined with choanocytes, which connect to the outer pockets of the pleats by ostia. This increase in the number of choanocytes and hence in pumping capacity enables syconoid sponges to grow up to a few centimeters in diameter.\n\n{{anchor|leuconoid}}The \"leuconoid\" pattern boosts pumping capacity further by filling the interior almost completely with mesohyl that contains a network of chambers lined with choanocytes and connected to each other and to the water intakes and outlet by tubes. Leuconid sponges grow to over {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter, and the fact that growth in any direction increases the number of choanocyte chambers enables them to take a wider range of forms, for example \"encrusting\" sponges whose shapes follow those of the surfaces to which they attach. All freshwater and most shallow-water marine sponges have leuconid bodies. The networks of water passages in [[glass sponge]]s are similar to the leuconid structure.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004Porifera\"/>\nIn all three types of structure the cross-section area of the choanocyte-lined regions is much greater than that of the intake and outlet channels. This makes the flow slower near the choanocytes and thus makes it easier for them to trap food particles.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004Porifera\"/> For example, in ''[[Leuconia]]'', a small leuconoid sponge about {{convert|10|cm|in}} tall and {{convert|1|cm|in}} in diameter, water enters each of more than 80,000 intake canals at 6&nbsp;cm per ''minute''. However, because ''Leuconia'' has more than 2&nbsp;million flagellated chambers whose combined diameter is much greater than that of the canals, water flow through chambers slows to 3.6&nbsp;cm per ''hour'', making it easy for choanocytes to capture food. All the water is expelled through a single [[osculum]] at about 8.5&nbsp;cm per ''second'', fast enough to carry waste products some distance away.<ref>{{cite book|author=C. Hickman, C .P. (Jr.), Roberts, L.

The mesohyl functions as an [[endoskeleton]] in most sponges, and is the only skeleton in soft sponges that encrust hard surfaces such as rocks. More commonly the mesohyl is stiffened by mineral [[sponge spicule|spicules]], by [[spongin]] fibers or both. Spicules may be made of [[silica]] or [[calcium carbonate]], and vary in shape from simple rods to three-dimensional \"stars\" with up to six rays. Spicules are produced by [[sclerocyte]] cells,<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004Porifera\"/> and may be separate, connected by joints, or fused.<ref name=\"HooperVanSoestDebrenne2002PhylumPorifera\"/>\n\nSome sponges also secrete [[exoskeleton]]s that lie completely outside their organic components. For example, [[sclerosponge]]s (\"hard sponges\") have massive calcium carbonate exoskeletons over which the organic matter forms a thin layer with [[choanocyte]] chambers in pits in the mineral. These exoskeletons are secreted by the [[pinacocyte]]s that form the animals' skins.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004Porifera\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Classes==\nSponges were traditionally distributed in three classes: calcareous sponges (Calcarea), glass sponges (Hexactinellida) and demosponges (Demospongiae). However, studies have shown that the [[Homoscleromorpha]], a group thought to belong to the [[Demospongiae]], is actually phylogenetically well separated. Therefore, they have recently been recognized as the fourth class of sponges.<ref name=\"Gazave2010\">{{cite journal | last1 = Gazave | first1 = E | last2 = Lap\u00e9bie | first2 = P | last3 = Renard | first3 = E | last4 = Vacelet | first4 = J | last5 = Rocher | first5 = C | last6 = Ereskovsky | first6 = AV | last7 = Lavrov | first7 = DV | last8 = Borchiellini | first8 = C | date = Dec 2010 | title = Molecular phylogeny restores the supra-generic subdivision of homoscleromorph sponges (porifera, homoscleromorpha) | url = | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 12| page = e14290 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0014290 | pmid=21179486 | pmc=3001884}}</ref><ref name=\"Gazave2012\">{{cite journal | last1 = Gazave | first1 = E. | last2 = Lap\u00e9bie | first2 = P. | last3 = Ereskovsky | first3 = A. | last4 = Vacelet | first4 = J. | last5 = Renard | first5 = E. | last6 = C\u00e1rdenas | first6 = P. | last7 = Borchiellini | first7 = C. | year = 2012 | title = No longer Demospongiae: Homoscleromorpha formal nomination as a fourth class of Porifera | url = | journal = Hydrobiologia | volume = 687 | issue = | pages = 3\u201310 | doi = 10.1007/s10750-011-0842-x }}</ref>\n\n<!--  [[File:Sponge in papua new guinea.jpg|thumb|A sponge in [[Papua New Guinea]]]]  -->\nSponges are divided into [[Class (biology)|classes]] mainly according to the composition of their [[skeleton]]s:<ref name=\"Bergquist2001PoriferaInAnderson\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! &nbsp; !!

A few species can contract their whole bodies, and many can close their [[osculum|oscula]] and [[wikt:ostium|ostia]]. Juveniles drift or swim freely, while adults are stationary.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004Porifera\"/>\n\n===Respiration, feeding and excretion===\nSponges do not have distinct [[circulatory]], [[respiratory]], [[digestion|digestive]], and [[excretory]] systems \u2013 instead the water flow system supports all these functions. They [[filter feeding|filter]] food particles out of the water flowing through them. Particles larger than 50&nbsp;micrometers cannot enter the [[wikt:ostium|ostia]] and [[pinacocyte]]s consume them by [[phagocytosis]] (engulfing and internal digestion). Particles from 0.5&nbsp;\u03bcm to 50&nbsp;\u03bcm are trapped in the ostia, which taper from the outer to inner ends. These particles are consumed by pinacocytes or by [[archaeocyte]]s which partially extrude themselves through the walls of the ostia. Bacteria-sized particles, below 0.5&nbsp;micrometers, pass through the ostia and are caught and consumed by [[choanocyte]]s.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004Porifera\"/> Since the smallest particles are by far the most common, choanocytes typically capture 80% of a sponge's food supply.<ref name=\"Bergquist2001InEncOfLifeSci\">{{cite book|contribution=Porifera (Sponges)|author=Bergquist, P.

However they reject [[Medical grafting|grafts]] from other species but accept them from other members of their own species.  In a few marine species, gray cells play the leading role in rejection of foreign material. When invaded, they produce a chemical that stops movement of other cells in the affected area, thus preventing the intruder from using the sponge's internal transport systems. If the intrusion persists, the grey cells concentrate in the area and release toxins that kill all cells in the area. The \"immune\" system can stay in this activated state for up to three weeks.<ref name=\"Bergquist2001PoriferaInAnderson\"/>\n\n===Reproduction===\n\n====Asexual====\n[[File:Spongilla lacustris.jpg| thumb|right|The freshwater sponge ''[[Spongilla lacustris]]'']]\nSponges have three [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] methods of reproduction: after fragmentation; by [[budding]]; and by producing [[gemmule]]s. Fragments of sponges may be detached by currents or waves. They use the mobility of their [[pinacocyte]]s and [[choanocyte]]s and reshaping of the [[mesohyl]] to re-attach themselves to a suitable surface and then rebuild themselves as small but functional sponges over the course of several days. The same capabilities enable sponges that have been squeezed through a fine cloth to regenerate.{{sfn|Ruppert|Fox|Barnes|2004|p=239}} A sponge fragment can only regenerate if it contains both [[collencyte]]s to produce [[mesohyl]] and [[archeocyte]]s to produce all the other cell types.<ref name=\"Bergquist2001InEncOfLifeSci\"/> A very few species reproduce by budding.{{sfn|Ruppert|Fox|Barnes|2004|pp=90\u201394}}\n\nGemmules are \"survival pods\" which a few marine sponges and many freshwater species produce by the thousands when dying and which some, mainly freshwater species, regularly produce in autumn. [[Spongocyte]]s make gemmules by wrapping shells of [[spongin]], often reinforced with spicules, round clusters of [[archeocyte]]s that are full of nutrients.{{sfn|Ruppert|Fox|Barnes|2004|pp=87\u201388}} Freshwater gemmules may also include phytosynthesizing symbionts.<ref name=\"SmithPennak2001FreshwaterInvertebrates\">{{cite book|author1=Smith, D.

Gemmules from the same species but different individuals can join forces to form one sponge.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes89-90\"/> Some gemmules are retained within the parent sponge, and in spring it can be difficult to tell whether an old sponge has revived or been \"recolonized\" by its own gemmules.<ref name=\"SmithPennak2001FreshwaterInvertebrates\"/>\n\n====Sexual====\nMost sponges are [[hermaphrodite]]s (function as both sexes simultaneously), although sponges have no [[gonad]]s (reproductive organs). Sperm are produced by [[choanocyte]]s or entire choanocyte chambers that sink into the [[mesohyl]] and form spermatic [[cyst]]s while eggs are formed by transformation of [[archeocyte]]s, or of choanocytes in some species. Each egg generally acquires a [[yolk]] by consuming \"nurse cells\". During spawning, sperm burst out of their cysts and are expelled via the [[osculum]]. If they contact another sponge of the same species, the water flow carries them to choanocytes that engulf them but, instead of digesting them, metamorphose to an [[ameboid]] form and carry the sperm through the mesohyl to eggs, which in most cases engulf the carrier and its cargo.{{sfn|Ruppert|Fox|Barnes|2004|p=77}}\n\nA few species release fertilized eggs into the water, but most retain the eggs until they hatch. There are four types of larvae, but all are balls of cells with an outer layer of cells whose [[flagella]]e or [[cilia]] enable the larvae to move. After swimming for a few days the larvae sink and crawl until they find a place to settle. Most of the cells transform into archeocytes and then into the types appropriate for their locations in a miniature adult sponge.{{sfn|Ruppert|Fox|Barnes|2004|p=77}}\n\n[[Glass sponge]] embryos start by dividing into separate cells, but once 32&nbsp;cells have formed they rapidly transform into larvae that externally are [[ovoid]] with a band of [[cilia]] round the middle that they use for movement, but internally have the typical glass sponge structure of spicules with a cobweb-like main [[syncitium]] draped around and between them and [[choanosyncytia]] with multiple collar bodies in  the center. The larvae then leave their parents' bodies.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Leys, S., Cheung, E., and Boury-Esnault, N.|title=Embryogenesis in the glass sponge ''Oopsacas minuta'': Formation of syncytia by fusion of blastomeres|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|year=2006|volume=46|issue=2|pages=104\u2013117|doi=10.1093/icb/icj016|pmid=21672727}}</ref>\n\n====Life cycle====\nSponges in [[temperate]] regions live for at most a few years, but some [[Tropics|tropical]] species and perhaps some deep-ocean ones may live for 200&nbsp;years or more. Some calcified [[demosponge]]s grow by only {{convert|0.2|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year and, if that rate is constant, specimens {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide must be about 5,000&nbsp;years old. Some sponges start sexual reproduction when only a few weeks old, while others wait until they are several years old.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004Porifera\"/>\n\n===Coordination of activities===\nAdult sponges lack [[neuron]]s or any other kind of [[nervous tissue]]. However most species have the ability to perform movements that are coordinated all over their bodies, mainly contractions of the [[pinacocyte]]s, squeezing the water channels and thus expelling excess sediment and other substances that may cause blockages. Some species can contract the [[osculum]] independently of the rest of the body. Sponges may also contract in order to reduce the area that is vulnerable to attack by predators. In cases where two sponges are fused, for example if there is a large but still unseparated bud, these contraction waves slowly become coordinated in both of the \"[[Siamese twins]]\". The coordinating mechanism is unknown, but may involve chemicals similar to [[neurotransmitter]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Nickel, M.|title=Kinetics and rhythm of body contractions in the sponge ''Tethya wilhelma'' (Porifera: Demospongiae)|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=207|pages=4515\u20134524|date=December 2004|doi= 10.1242/jeb.01289|pmid=15579547|issue=Pt 26}}</ref> However [[glass sponge]]s rapidly transmit electrical impulses through all parts of the [[syncytium]], and use this to halt the motion of their [[flagella]] if the incoming water contains toxins or excessive sediment.<ref name=\"RuppertBarnes2004Porifera\"/> [[Myocyte]]s are thought to be responsible for closing the osculum and for transmitting signals between different parts of the body.<ref name=\"Bergquist2001PoriferaInAnderson\"/>\n\nSponges contain [[gene]]s very similar to those that contain the \"recipe\" for the post-[[synapse|synaptic]] density, an important signal-receiving structure in the neurons of all other animals. However, in sponges these genes are only activated in \"flask cells\" that appear only in larvae and may provide some sensory capability while the larvae are swimming. This raises questions about whether flask cells represent the predecessors of true neurons or are evidence that sponges' ancestors had true neurons but lost them as they adapted to a sessile lifestyle.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sakarya|year=2007|title=A Post-Synaptic Scaffold at the Origin of the Animal Kingdom|journal=[[PLOS ONE]]|volume=2|issue=6|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000506|pages=e506|pmid=17551586|pmc=1876816|editor1-last=Vosshall|editor1-first=Leslie|author2=O.|author3=Armstrong|author4=K.
