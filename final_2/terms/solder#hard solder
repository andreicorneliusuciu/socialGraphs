The word solder comes from the [[Middle English]] word ''soudur'', via [[Old French]] ''solduree'' and ''soulder'', from the [[Latin]] ''solidare'', meaning \"to make solid\".<ref>{{OEtymD|solder}}</ref> In fact, solder must be melted in order to adhere to and connect the pieces together, so a suitable alloy for use as solder will have a lower melting point than the pieces it is intended to join. Whenever possible, the solder should also be resistant to oxidative and corrosive effects that would degrade the joint over time. Solders intended for use in making electrical connections between electronic components also usually have favorable electrical characteristics.\n\nSoft solder typically has a melting point range of {{convert|90|to|450|C|F K|-1}},<ref>Frank Oberg, Franklin D. Jones, Holbrook L.Horton, Henry H. Ryffel (ed) ''Machinery's Handbook 23rd Edition'' Industrial Press Inc., 1988, ISBN 0-8311-1200-X, page 1203</ref> and is commonly used in [[electronics]], [[plumbing]],  and sheet metal work. Manual soldering uses a [[soldering iron]] or [[soldering gun]]. [[Alloy]]s that melt between {{convert|180|and|190|C|F K|-1}} are the most commonly used. Soldering performed using alloys with a melting point above {{convert|450|C|F K|-1}} is called 'hard soldering', 'silver soldering', or [[brazing]].\n\nIn specific proportions, some alloys can become [[eutectic]] \u2014 that is, their [[melting]] point is the same as their [[freezing]] point. Non-eutectic alloys have markedly different ''[[solidus (chemistry)|solidus]]'' and ''[[liquidus]]'' temperatures, and within that range they exist as a paste of solid particles in a melt of the lower-melting phase. In electrical work, if the joint is disturbed in the pasty state before it has solidified totally, a poor electrical connection may result; use of eutectic solder reduces this problem. The pasty state of a non-eutectic solder can be exploited in plumbing as it allows molding of the solder during cooling, e.g. for ensuring watertight joint of pipes, resulting in a so-called 'wiped joint'.\n\nFor electrical and electronics work, solder wire is available in a range of thicknesses for hand-soldering, and with cores containing [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]]. It is also available as a paste or as a preformed foil shaped to match the workpiece, more suitable for mechanized [[mass-production]]. Alloys of lead and tin were commonly used in the past, and are still available; they are particularly convenient for hand-soldering. [[#Lead-free solder|'''Lead-free solder''']]s have been increasing in use due to regulatory requirements plus the health and environmental benefits of avoiding lead-based electronic components. They are almost exclusively used today in consumer electronics.<ref name=\"lead-free-benefits\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ogunseitan | first1 = Oladele A. | year = 2007 | title = Public health and environmental benefits of adopting lead-free solders | url = http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11837-007-0082-8 | journal = Journal of The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society | volume = 59 | issue = 7| pages = 12\u201317 | doi=10.1007/s11837-007-0082-8}}</ref>\n\nPlumbers often use bars of solder, much thicker than the wire used for electrical applications. [[Jeweler]]s often use solder in thin sheets, which they cut into snippets.\n\n==Lead-free solder==\n<!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: This section is internally linked from the \"Lead solder\"-section of this article.]] -->\n[[File:Pure tin solder.JPG|thumb|Pure tin solder wire]]\n[[File:Propane torch soldering copper pipe.jpg|thumb|Soldering copper pipes using a propane torch and lead-free solder]]\nOn July 1, 2006 the [[European Union]] [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive]] (WEEE) and [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive]] (RoHS) came into effect prohibiting the inclusion of significant quantities of lead in most consumer electronics produced in the EU. In the US, manufacturers may receive tax benefits by reducing the use of lead-based solder. Lead-free solders in commercial use may contain tin, copper, silver, [[bismuth]], [[indium]], [[zinc]], antimony, and traces of other metals. Most lead-free replacements for conventional 60/40 and 63/37&nbsp;Sn-Pb solder have melting points from 5 to 20&nbsp;\u00b0C higher,<ref name=\"leadfreeel\" /> though there are also solders with much lower melting points.\n\nIt may be desirable to use minor modification of the solder pots (e.g. [[titanium]] liners or impellers) used in wave-soldering, to reduce maintenance cost due to increased tin-scavenging of high-tin solder.\n\nLead-free solder may be less desirable for critical applications, such as [[aerospace]] and medical projects, because its properties are less thoroughly known.\n\n[[Tin-Silver-Copper]] (Sn-Ag-Cu, or \"SAC\") solders are used by two-thirds of Japanese manufacturers for reflow and [[wave soldering]], and by about 75% of companies for hand soldering. The widespread use of this popular lead-free solder alloy family is based on the reduced melting point of the Sn-Ag-Cu ternary eutectic behavior (217&nbsp;\u02daC), which is below the 22/78&nbsp;Sn-Ag (wt.%) eutectic of 221&nbsp;\u00b0C and the 59/41&nbsp;Sn-Cu eutectic of 227&nbsp;\u00b0C (recently revised by P. Snugovsky to 53/47&nbsp;Sn-Cu). The ternary eutectic behavior of Sn-Ag-Cu and its application for electronics assembly was discovered (and patented) by a team of researchers from [[Ames Laboratory]], [[Iowa State University]], and from [[Sandia National Laboratories]]-Albuquerque.\n\nMuch recent research has focused on selection of 4th element additions to Sn-Ag-Cu to provide compatibility for the reduced cooling rate of solder sphere reflow for assembly of [[ball grid array]]s, e.g., 18/64/14/4&nbsp;Tin-Silver-Copper-Zinc (Sn-Ag-Cu-Zn) (melting range of 217\u2013220&nbsp;\u02daC) and 18/64/16/2&nbsp;Tin-Silver-Copper-[[Manganese]] (Sn-Ag-Cu-Mn) (melting range of 211\u2013215&nbsp;\u02daC).\n\nTin-based solders readily dissolve gold, forming brittle intermetallics; for Sn-Pb alloys the critical concentration of gold to embrittle the joint is about 4%. Indium-rich solders (usually indium-lead) are more suitable for soldering thicker gold layer as the dissolution rate of gold in indium is much slower. Tin-rich solders also readily dissolve silver; for soldering silver metallization or surfaces, alloys with addition of silvers are suitable; tin-free alloys are also a choice, though their wettability is poorer. If the soldering time is long enough to form the intermetallics, the tin surface of a joint soldered to gold is very dull.<ref name=\"solsolmat\" />\n\n== Lead solder ==\n[[File:60-40 Solder.jpg|thumb|Sn<sub>60</sub>Pb<sub>40</sub> solder]]\n[[Tin]]-[[lead]] (Sn-Pb) solders, also called soft solders, are commercially available with tin concentrations between 5% and 70% by weight. The greater the tin concentration, the greater the solder\u2019s [[tensile strength|tensile]] and [[shear strength]]s. Historically, lead has been widely believed to mitigate the formation of [[tin whiskers]], though the precise mechanism for this is unknown.<ref>[http://nepp.nasa.gov/Whisker/background/index.htm    Basic Information Regarding Tin Whiskers]</ref> Today, many techniques are used to mitigate the problem, including changes to the annealing process (heating and cooling), addition of elements like copper and nickel, and the inclusion of [[conformal coating]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dfrsolutions.com/uploads/white-papers/WP_SnWhisker.pdf|title=A New (Better) Approach to Tin Whisker Mitigation|author1=Craig Hillman |author2=Gregg Kittlesen |author3=Randy Schueller  |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=DFR Solutions |accessdate=23 October 2013 }}</ref> Alloys commonly used for electrical soldering are 60/40&nbsp;Sn-Pb, which melts at {{convert|188|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}},<ref>http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/315929.pdf</ref> and 63/37&nbsp;Sn-Pb used principally in electrical/electronic work. 63/37 is a [[eutectic point|eutectic]] alloy of these metals, which:\n# has the lowest melting point ({{convert|183|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|disp=or}}) of all the tin-lead alloys; and\n# the melting point is truly a ''point''&nbsp;\u2014 not a range.\n\nIn plumbing applications today, lead is prohibited. Historically, a higher proportion of lead was used, commonly 50/50. This had the advantage of making the alloy solidify more slowly. With the pipes being physically fitted together before soldering, the solder could be wiped over the joint to ensure water tightness. Although lead water pipes were displaced by copper when the significance of [[lead poisoning]] began to be fully appreciated, lead solder was still used until the 1980s because it was thought that the amount of lead that could leach into water from the solder was negligible from a properly soldered joint. The [[electrochemical]] couple of copper and lead promotes corrosion of the lead and tin.  Tin, however, is protected by insoluble oxide. Since even small amounts of lead have been found detrimental to health,<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJM199001113220203|pmid=2294437|year=1990|last1=Needleman|first1=HL|last2=Schell|first2=A|last3=Bellinger|first3=D|last4=Leviton|first4=A|last5=Allred|first5=EN|title=The long-term effects of exposure to low doses of lead in childhood.

High-tin tin-lead alloys have limited use as the workability range can be provided by a cheaper high-lead alloy.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Sg9fAVdf8WoC&pg=PA538|title=Alloying: understanding the basics |publisher=ASM International|page=538|author=Joseph R.

The two principal types of flux are acid flux (sometimes called \"active flux\"), used for metal mending and plumbing, and [[rosin]] flux (sometimes called \"passive flux\"), used in electronics, where the corrosiveness of the vapors released when acid flux is heated would risk damaging delicate circuitry.\n\nDue to concerns over [[atmospheric pollution]] and [[hazardous waste]] disposal, the electronics industry has been gradually shifting from rosin flux to water-soluble flux, which can be removed with [[deionized water]] and [[detergent]], instead of [[hydrocarbon]] [[solvent]]s.\n\nIn contrast to using traditional bars or coiled wires of all-metal solder and manually applying flux to the parts being joined, much hand soldering since the mid-20th century has used flux-core solder. This is manufactured as a coiled wire of solder, with one or more continuous bodies of non-acid flux embedded lengthwise inside it. As the solder melts onto the joint, it frees the flux and releases that on it as well.\n\n== Hard solder ==\nHard solders are used for brazing, and melt at higher temperatures. Alloys of copper with either zinc or silver are the most common.\n\nIn [[silversmithing]] or [[jewelry]] making, special hard solders are used that will pass [[Metallurgical assay|assay]]. They contain a high proportion of the metal being soldered and lead is not used in these alloys. These solders vary in hardness, designated as \"enameling\", \"hard\", \"medium\" and \"easy\". [[Vitreous enamel|Enameling]] solder has a high melting point, close to that of the material itself, to prevent the joint [[desoldering]] during firing in the enameling process. The remaining solder types are used in decreasing order of hardness during the process of making an item, to prevent a previously soldered seam or joint desoldering while additional sites are soldered. Easy solder is also often used for repair work for the same reason. Flux or [[jeweller's rouge|rouge]] is also used to prevent joints from desoldering.\n\nSilver solder is also used in manufacturing to join metal parts that cannot be [[welding|welded]]. The alloys used for these purposes contain a high proportion of silver (up to 40%), and may also contain [[cadmium]].\n\n== Solder alloys ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Composition !!

Pure metals solidify at a certain temperature, forming crystals of one phase. Eutectic alloys also solidify at a single temperature, all components precipitating simultaneously in so-called [[coupled growth]]. Non-eutectic compositions on cooling start to first precipitate the non-eutectic phase; dendrites when it is a metal, large crystals when it is an intermetallic compound. Such a mixture of solid particles in a molten eutectic is referred to as a '''mushy''' state. Even a relatively small proportion of solids in the liquid can dramatically lower its fluidity.<ref name=\"nimodcusn\" />\n\nThe temperature of total solidification is the solidus of the alloy, the temperature at which all components are molten is the liquidus.\n\nThe mushy state is desired where a degree of plasticity is beneficial for creating the joint, allowing filling larger gaps or being wiped over the joint (e.g. when soldering pipes). In hand soldering of electronics it may be detrimental as the joint may appear solidified while it is not yet. Premature handling of such joint then disrupts its internal structure and leads to compromised mechanical integrity.\n\n=== Alloying element roles ===\nDifferent elements serve different roles in the solder alloy:\n* [[Antimony]] is added to increase strength without affecting wettability. Prevents tin pest. Should be avoided on zinc, cadmium, or galvanized metals as the resulting joint is brittle.<ref name=\"mfgproc\" />\n* [[Bismuth]] significantly lowers the melting point and improves wettability. In presence of sufficient lead and tin, bismuth forms crystals of Sn<sub>16</sub>Pb<sub>32</sub>Bi<sub>52</sub> with melting point of only 95&nbsp;\u00b0C, which diffuses along the grain boundaries and may cause a joint failure at relatively low temperatures. A high-power part pre-tinned with an alloy of lead can therefore desolder under load when soldered with a bismuth-containing solder. Such joints are also prone to cracking. Alloys with more than 47% Bi expand upon cooling, which may be used to offset thermal expansion mismatch stresses. Retards growth of [[tin whiskers]]. Relatively expensive, limited availability.\n* [[Copper]] lowers the melting point, improves resistance to thermal cycle fatigue, and improves [[wetting]] properties of the molten solder. It also slows down the rate of dissolution of copper from the board and part leads in the liquid solder. Forms intermetallic compounds. May promote growth of tin whiskers. Supersaturated (by about 1%) solution of copper in tin may be employed to inhibit dissolution of thin-film under-bump metallization of [[ball grid array|BGA]] chips, e.g. as Sn<sub>94</sub>Ag<sub>3</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>.<ref name=\"soljoint\" />\n* [[Nickel]] can be added to the solder alloy to form a supersaturated solution to inhibit dissolution of thin-film under-bump metallization.<ref name=\"soljoint\" />\n* [[Indium]] lowers the melting point and improves ductility. In presence of lead it forms a ternary compound that undergoes phase change at 114&nbsp;\u00b0C. Very high cost (several times of silver), low availability. Easily oxidizes, which causes problems for repairs and reworks, especially when oxide-removing flux cannot be used, e.g. during GaAs die attachment. Indium alloys are used for cryogenic applications, and for soldering gold as gold dissolves in indium much less than in tin. Indium can also solder many nonmetals (e.g. glass, mica, alumina, magnesia, titania, zirconia, porcelain, brick, concrete, and marble). Prone to diffusion into semiconductors and cause undesired doping. At elevated temperatures easily diffuses through metals. Low vapor pressure, suitable for use in vacuum systems. Forms brittle intermetallics with gold; indium-rich solders on thick gold are unreliable. Indium-based solders are prone to corrosion, especially in presence of [[chloride]] ions.<ref>{{cite book|author=I. R.

Worse wetting than tin. Toxic, being phased out. Retards growth of tin whiskers, inhibits tin pest. Lowers solubility of copper and other metals in tin.\n* [[Silver]] provides mechanical strength, but has worse ductility than lead. In absence of lead, it improves resistance to fatigue from thermal cycles. Using SnAg solders with HASL-SnPb-coated leads forms SnPb<sub>36</sub>Ag<sub>2</sub> phase with melting point at 179&nbsp;\u00b0C, which moves to the board-solder interface, solidifies last, and separates from the board.<ref name=\"leadfreeel\" /> Addition of silver to tin significantly lowers solubility of silver coatings in the tin phase. In eutectic tin-silver (3.5% Ag) alloy it tends to form platelets of Ag<sub>3</sub>Sn, which, if formed near a high-stress spot, may serve as initiating sites for cracks; silver content needs to be kept below 3% to inhibit such problems.<ref name=\"soljoint\">King-Ning-Tu \u2013 Solder Joint Technology \u2013 Materials, Properties, and Reliability (Springer 2007)</ref>\n* [[Tin]] is the usual main structural metal of the alloy. It has good strength and wetting. On its own it is prone to [[tin pest]], [[tin cry]], and growth of [[tin whiskers]]. Readily dissolves silver, gold and to less but still significant extent many other metals, e.g. copper; this is a particular concern for tin-rich alloys with higher melting points and reflow temperatures.\n* [[Zinc]] lowers the melting point and is low-cost. However it is highly susceptible to corrosion and oxidation in air, therefore zinc-containing alloys are unsuitable for some purposes, e.g. wave soldering, and zinc-containing solder pastes have shorter shelf life than zinc-free. Can form brittle Cu-Zn intermetallic layers in contact with copper. Readily oxidizes which impairs wetting, requires a suitable flux.\n* [[Germanium]] in tin-based lead-free solders influences formation of oxides; at below 0.002% it increases formation of oxides. Optimal concentration for suppressing oxidation is at 0.005%.<ref>[http://www.balverzinn.com/downloads/DESOXY_RSN_GB.pdf Balver Zinn Desoxy RSN]</ref>\n\n=== Impurities in solders ===\nImpurities usually enter the solder reservoir by dissolving the metals present in the assemblies being soldered.

Intermetallics are often hard and brittle. Finely distributed intermetallics in a ductile matrix yield a hard alloy while coarse structure gives a softer alloy. A range of intermetallics often forms between the metal and the solder, with increasing proportion of the metal; e.g. forming a structure of Cu-Cu<sub>3</sub>Sn-Cu<sub>6</sub>Sn<sub>5</sub>-Sn.\n\nLayers of intermetallics can form between the solder and the soldered material. These layers may cause mechanical reliability weakening and brittleness, increased electrical resistance, or electromigration and formation of voids. The gold-tin intermetallics layer is responsible for poor mechanical reliability of tin-soldered gold-plated surfaces where the gold plating did not completely dissolve in the solder.\n\nGold and palladium readily dissolve in solders. Copper and nickel tend to form intermetallic layers during normal soldering profiles. Indium forms intermetallics as well.\n\nIndium-gold intermetallics are brittle and occupy about 4 times more volume than the original gold. Bonding wires are especially susceptible to indium attack. Such intermetallic growth, together with thermal cycling, can lead to failure of the bonding wires.<ref>http://nepp.nasa.gov/wirebond/literatures/na-gsfc-2004-01.pdf GSFC NASA Advisory: Indium solder encapsulating gold bonding wire leads to fragile gold-indium compounds and an unreliable condition that results in wire interconnection rupture</ref>\n\nCopper plated with nickel and gold is often used. The thin gold layer facilitates good solderability of nickel as it protects the nickel from oxidation; the layer has to be thin enough to rapidly and completely dissolve so bare nickel is exposed to the solder.<ref name=\"handblfs\" />\n\nLead-tin solder layers on copper leads can form copper-tin intermetallic layers; the solder alloy is then locally depleted of tin and form a lead-rich layer. The Sn-Cu intermetallics then can get exposed to oxidation, resulting in impaired solderability.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GTq6w21s2cwC&pg=PA397 |title=Modern solder technology for competitive electronics manufacturing|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|page=397|author=Jennie S. Hwang|isbn=0-07-031749-6|year=1996}}</ref>\n\nTwo processes play a role in a solder joint formation: interaction between the substrate and molten solder, and solid-state growth of intermetallic compounds. The base metal dissolves in the molten solder in an amount depending on its solubility in the solder. The active constituent of the solder reacts with the base metal with a rate dependent on the solubility of the active constituents in the base metal. The solid-state reactions are more complex \u2013 the formation of intermetallics can be inhibited by changing the composition of the base metal or the solder alloy, or by using a suitable [[barrier layer]] to inhibit diffusion of the metals.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HgqTNwFkfeEC&pg=PA51|title=The Mechanics of solder alloy interconnects|publisher=Springer|page=51|author1=D.

The glass solder has to flow and wet the soldered surfaces well below the temperature where deformation or degradation of either of the joined materials or nearby structures (e.g., metallization layers on chips or ceramic substrates) occurs. The usual temperature of achieving flowing and wetting is between 450 and 550&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nTwo types of glass solders are used: vitreous, and [[devitrification|devitrifying]]. Vitreous solders retain their amorphous structure during remelting, can be reworked repeatedly, and are relatively transparent. Devitrifying solders undergo partial crystallization during solidifying, forming a [[glass-ceramic]], a composite of glassy and crystalline phases. Devitrifying solders usually create a stronger mechanical bond, but are more temperature-sensitive and the seal is more likely to be leaky; due to their polycrystalline structure they tend to be translucent or opaque.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=c2YxCCaM9RIC&pg=PA239|author=Merrill L. Minges |title=Electronic Materials Handbook: Packaging|publisher=ASM International|year=1989|isbn=0-87170-285-1|page=239}}</ref> Devitrifying solders are frequently \"thermosetting\", as their melting temperature after recrystallization becomes significantly higher; this allows soldering the parts together at lower temperature than the subsequent [[bake-out]] without remelting the joint afterwards. Devitrifying solders frequently contain up to 25% zinc oxide. In production of [[cathode ray tube]]s, devitrifying solders based on PbO-B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-ZnO are used.\n\nVery low temperature melting glasses, fluid at 200\u2013400&nbsp;\u00b0C, were developed for sealing applications for electronics. They can consist of binary or ternary mixtures of [[thallium]], [[arsenic]] and [[sulfur]].<ref name=\"handbmatvac\" /> Zinc-silicoborate glasses can also be used for passivation of electronics; their coefficient of thermal expansion must match [[silicon]] (or the other semiconductors used) and they must not contain alkaline metals as those would migrate to the semiconductor and cause failures.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dzNPGZqQY3wC&pg=PA40|page=40|title=Forensic examination of glass and paint: analysis and interpretation|publisher=CRC Press|year=2001|isbn=0-7484-0579-8|author=Brian Caddy}}</ref>\n\nThe bonding between the glass or ceramics and the glass solder can be either [[covalent bond|covalent]], or, more often, [[van der Waals force|van der Waals]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CRt97aa7cnMC&pg=PA389|page=389|author=Robert W.

Glass solders can be also used as [[sealant]]s; a vitreous enamel coating on [[iron]] lowered its permeability to [[hydrogen]] 10 times.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sdKAPJh5RgQC&pg=PA273|page=273 |title=Vacuum sealing techniques |author=Alexander Roth|publisher=Springer|year=1994|isbn=1-56396-259-4}}</ref> Glass solders are frequently used for [[glass-to-metal seal]]s and [[glass-ceramic-to-metal seal]]s.\n\nGlass solders are available as [[frit]] powder with grain size below 60 micrometers. They can be mixed with water or alcohol to form a paste for easy application, or with dissolved [[nitrocellulose]] or other suitable binder for adhering to the surfaces until being melted.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=v5q4Hje3iFgC&pg=PA30|page=30 |title=Schott guide to glass|author=Heinz G. Pfaender|publisher=Springer|year=1996|isbn=0-412-62060-X}}</ref> The eventual binder has to be burned off before melting proceeds, requiring careful [[pottery firing|firing]] regime. The solder glass can be also applied from molten state to the area of the future joint during manufacture of the part. Due to their low viscosity in molten state, [[lead glass]]es with high [[lead(II) oxide|PbO]] content (often 70\u201385%) are frequently used. The most common compositions are based on lead [[borate]]s (leaded [[borate glass]] or [[borosilicate glass]]). Smaller amount of [[zinc oxide]] or [[aluminium oxide]] can be added for increasing chemical stability. [[Phosphate glass]]es can be also employed. Zinc oxide, [[bismuth trioxide]], and [[copper(II) oxide]] can be added for influencing the thermal expansion; unlike the alkali oxides, these lower the softening point without increasing of thermal expansion.\n\nGlass solders are frequently used in [[electronic packaging]]. [[CERDIP]] packagings are an example. Outgassing of water from the glass solder during encapsulation was a cause of high failure rates of early CERDIP [[integrated circuit]]s. Removal of glass-soldered ceramic covers, e.g., for gaining access to the chip for [[failure analysis]] or [[reverse engineering]], is best done by [[shearing (physics)|shearing]]; if this is too risky, the cover is polished away instead.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7VNfvKjlzYAC&pg=PA8|page=8|title=Integrated circuit failure analysis: a guide to preparation techniques|author=Friedrich Beck|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=1998|isbn=0-471-97401-3}}</ref>\n\nAs the seals can be performed at much lower temperature than with direct joining of glass parts and without use of flame (using a temperature-controlled [[kiln]] or oven), glass solders are useful in applications like subminiature [[vacuum tube]]s or for joining mica windows to vacuum tubes and instruments (e.g., [[Geiger tube]]). Thermal expansion coefficient has to be matched to the materials being joined and often is chosen in between the coefficients of expansion of the materials. In case of having to compromise, subjecting the joint to compression stresses is more desirable than to tensile stresses. The expansion matching is not critical in applications where thin layers are used on small areas, e.g., fireable [[ink]]s, or where the joint will be subjected to a permanent compression (e.g., by an external steel shell) offsetting the thermally introduced tensile stresses.<ref name=\"handbmatvac\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-Ll6qjWB-RUC&pg=PA51|page=51 |title=Handbook of materials and techniques for vacuum devices|publisher=Springer|year=1995|isbn=978-1-56396-387-2|author=Walter Heinrich Kohl}}</ref>\n\nGlass solder can be used as an intermediate layer when joining materials (glasses, ceramics) with significantly different [[coefficient of thermal expansion]]; such materials cannot be directly joined by [[diffusion welding]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2obIbuqA43UC&pg=PA374|page=374|title=Micro process engineering: fundamentals, devices, fabrication, and applications|author=Norbert Kockmann|publisher=Wiley-VCH|year=2006|isbn=3-527-31246-3}}</ref> [[Evacuated glazing]] [[window]]s are made of glass panels soldered together.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_btgLVQUVL0C&pg=PT96|page=96 |title=Interior Decoration&nbsp;\u2013 A Complete Course|author=Shirley Morris|publisher=Global Media|year=2007|isbn=81-89940-65-1}}</ref>\n\nA glass solder is used, e.g., for joining together parts of cathode ray tubes and [[plasma display]] panels. Newer compositions lowered the usage temperature from 450 to 390&nbsp;\u00b0C by reducing the lead(II) oxide content down from 70%, increasing the zinc oxide content, adding [[titanium dioxide]] and [[bismuth(III) oxide]] and some other components. The high [[thermal expansion]] of such glass can be reduced by a suitable ceramic [[filler (material)|filler]]. [[Lead-free]] solder glasses with soldering temperature of 450&nbsp;\u00b0C were also developed.\n\nPhosphate glasses with low melting temperature were developed.
