Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. Robonaut differs from other current space-faring robots in that, while most current space robotic systems (such as robotic arms, cranes and exploration rovers) are designed to move large objects, Robonaut's tasks require more dexterity.\n\nThe core idea behind the Robonaut series is to have a humanoid machine work alongside [[astronauts]]. Its [[Design|form factor]] and dexterity are designed such that Robonaut can use space tools and work in similar environments suited to astronauts.\n\nThe latest Robonaut version, R2, the first US-built robot on the ISS,<ref name=\"robonaut.default\">{{cite web|url=http://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/default.asp|title=Robonaut home page|accessdate=27 May 2011|publisher=Nasa}}</ref> delivered by STS-133 in Feb 2011, is a robotic torso designed to assist with crew [[Extravehicular activity|EVA's]] and can hold tools used by the crew.<ref name=\"ROBOISS\">{{cite web|url=http://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/ISS/|title=Robonaut Robonaut ISS Mission|accessdate=27 May 2011|publisher=Nasa}}</ref> However, Robonaut 2 does not have adequate protection needed to exist outside the space station and enhancements and modifications would be required to allow it to move around the station's interior.<ref name=\"ROBOISS\"/> NASA states \"Robonauts are essential to NASA's future as we go beyond [[low Earth orbit]]\",<ref name=\"robonaut.default\"/> and R2 will provide performance data about how a robot may work side-by-side with astronauts.<ref name=\"ROBOISS\"/>\n\n== Conception ==\n[[Image:Robonaut concept.jpg|thumb|right|Robonaut 1996 concept]]\nWork on the first Robonaut began in 1997. The idea was to build a humanoid robot that could assist astronauts on tasks in which another pair of hands would be helpful or to venture forth to perform jobs either too dangerous for crew members to risk or too mundane for them to spend time on. This system wouldn't need specialized tools and would be able to use the same ones as the astronauts. \nThe initial design of Robonaut was for it to be used as an end-effector for the [[Canadarm2|robotic arm]] on the [[International Space Station]], where it could serve as an alternative to human extravehicular activity for external maintenance on the station.\n\n==Robonaut 1==\n'''Robonaut 1 (R1)''' was the first model. The two Robonaut versions (R1A and R1B) had many partners including [[DARPA]]. None were flown to space. Other designs for Robonaut propose uses for [[teleoperation]] on planetary surfaces, where Robonaut could explore a planetary surface while receiving instructions from orbiting astronauts above.<ref>Nicholos Wethington, Universe Today, \"[http://www.universetoday.com/2007/12/03/future-mars-explorers-might-only-see-the-planet-from-orbit/ Future Mars Explorers Might Only See the Planet from Orbit]\" December 3rd, 2007 (accessed 12 August 2009)</ref> Robonaut B was introduced in 2002, R1B is a portable version of R1.<ref>[http://research.jsc.nasa.gov/PDF/Eng-26.pdf Robonaut], Robert Ambrose, Johnson Space Center</ref> R1 had several lower bodies.  One of these was the Zero-G Leg, which if Robonaut was working on the space station he would climb using the external handrails and then use his zero-g leg to latch onto the station using a WIF socket. Another was the Robotic Mobility Platform (RMP), developed in 2003,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/nsp/course/16-899/papers/hands/RobonautHand/robonautMobile.pdf|title=Mobile Manipulation using NASA\u2019s Robonaut|date=April 2004|publisher=International Conference on Robotics & Automation|accessdate=26 June 2011}}</ref> it is a base with two wheels using a [[Segway PT]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Segway platform puts robots in motion |url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/robotics/2004-10-20-rise-of-robots_x.htm |quote=Segway's self-balancing robot platform takes up about 2 square feet and comes equipped with software and interface electronics necessary to receive, process and execute commands from an onboard robot payload. |work=[[USA Today]] |date=October 20, 2004 |accessdate=2010-11-01 }}</ref> And the four wheeled Centaur 1, which was developed in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/default.asp|title=Robonaut|publisher=NASA|accessdate=26 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/m-whitepaper.asp|title=Robonaut: Project M Whitepaper|work=nasa.gov}}</ref> \nRobonaut has participated in NASA's [[Desert Research and Technology Studies]] field trials in the Arizona desert.<ref>{{cite web|last=Berger|first=Brian|title=NASA auditions robots for lunar exploration|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15923720/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/nasa-auditions-robots-lunar-missions/|accessdate=2011-06-24}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the automotive company [[General Motors]] expressed interest in the project and proposed to team up with NASA. In 2007 a Space Act Agreement was signed that allowed GM and NASA to work together on the next generation of Robonaut.<ref name=Fact>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/469616main_Robonaut2_factsheet.pdf|title=Robonaut 2: Fact Sheet|publisher=NASA|accessdate=25 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n<center>\n<gallery perrow=\"5\">\nImage:Robonaut with zero-g leg.jpg | Robonaut with zero-g leg\nImage:H robonaut wheels 02.jpg | Robonaut attached to RMP\nImage:Robonaut 1 attached to Centaur 1.jpg | Robonaut attached to Centaur 1\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n== Robonaut 2 ==\n[[File:Robonaut2 - first movement aboard ISS.jpg|thumb|R2 moves for the first time aboard the ISS|250 px]]\nIn February 2010, '''Robonaut 2 (R2)''' was revealed to the public. R2 is capable of speeds more than four times faster than R1, is more compact, more dexterous, and includes a deeper and wider range of sensing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/default.asp|title=Robonaut 2|publisher=NASA|accessdate=25 June 2011}}</ref> It can move its arms up to 2&nbsp;m/s, has a 40&nbsp;lb payload capacity and its hands have a grasping force of roughly 5&nbsp;lbs. per finger. There are over 350 sensors and 38 [[PowerPC]] processors in the robot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/116741904.html|title=NASA\u2019s First Robot Astronaut|work=Sky & Telescope}}</ref>\n\nStation crew members will be able to operate R2, as will controllers on the ground; both will do so using [[telepresence]]. One of the improvements over the previous Robonaut generation is that R2 doesn\u2019t need constant supervision. In anticipation of a future destination in which distance and time delays would make continuous management problematic, R2 was designed to be set to tasks and then carry them through [[Autonomous robot|autonomously]] with periodic status checks.<ref name=Fact/> While not all human range of motion and sensitivity has been duplicated, the robot's hand has 12 [[Degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]] as well as 2 degrees of freedom in wrist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/SEH/Robotics/index.html|title=Robonaut Hand Subsystem|work=nasa.gov}}</ref><ref>C.

The outer skin materials were exchanged to meet the station\u2019s flammability requirements, shielding was added to reduce electromagnetic interference, processors were upgraded to increase the robot\u2019s radiation tolerance, the original fans were replaced with quieter ones to accommodate the station\u2019s noise requirements, and the power system was rewired to run on the station\u2019s direct current system rather than the alternating current used on the ground.<ref name=Fact/>\n\n[[File:Robonaut upgrade.jpg|thumbnail|Robonaut being upgraded on-orbit|250 px]]\nRobonaut 2 was launched on [[STS-133]] on February 24, 2011, and delivered to the [[ISS]]. On August 22, R2 was powered up for the first time while in low earth orbit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyHZpczl9fo|title=Welcome Aboard Robonaut 2 |date=2011-09-19|publisher=NASA|accessdate=3 November 2011}}</ref> This was called a \"power soak\" which is a power system test only with no movement. On October 13, R2 moved for the first time while in space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glLX_sKTU2I|title=First Movement of Robonaut 2 on ISS |date=2011-11-02|publisher=NASA|accessdate=3 November 2011}}</ref> The conditions aboard the space station provide a proving ground for robots to work shoulder to shoulder with people in microgravity. Once this has been demonstrated inside the station, software upgrades and lower bodies may be added, allowing R2 to move around the interior of the station and perform maintenance tasks, such as vacuuming or cleaning filters.<ref name=Fact/> A pair of legs were delivered to the ISS on [[SpaceX CRS-3|SpX-3]] in April 2014. The battery backpack was planned to be launched on a later flight in Summer/Fall 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AstroRobonaut/status/443814031355174912|title=Twitter- AstroRobonaut|date=12 March 2014|publisher=NASA|accessdate=29 March 2014}}</ref>\nIn the design of the R2 robot, a 3D time of flight imager will be used in conjunction with a stereo camera pair to provide depth information and visible stereo images to the system. This allows the R2 to \"see\", which is one of the basic preconditions to fulfill its tasks. To integrate the various sensor data types in a single development environment the image processing software [[Halcon (software)|Halcon]] 9.0 from MVTec Software (Munich, Germany[http://www.mvtec.com]) is used. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.photonics.com/Article.aspx?AID=50769|title=Vision Software Enables NASA Robonaut to See|author=Dr. Lutz Kreutzer, Mvtec Software GmbH|date=1 May 2012|work=Photonics Spectra}}</ref>\n\nFurther upgrades could be added to allow R2 to work outside in the vacuum of space, where R2 could help space walkers perform repairs, make additions to the station or conduct scientific experiments. There are no plans to return the launched R2 back to earth.<ref name=Fact/>\n\nNASA's experience with R2 on the station will help them understand its capabilities for possible deep space missions.\n\n<center>\n<gallery perrow=\"5\">\nImage:Robonaut2 and Dan Burbank.jpg | R2 aboard ISS with [[Dan Burbank]]\nImage:Robonaut 2 and Centaur 2.jpg | R2 attached to Centaur 2\nImage:Robonaut and Project M concept art.jpg | R2 with proposed terrestrial legs\nImage:R2 climb legs demo.jpg| R2 with its 'climbing legs'\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n=== Project M ===\nIn late 2009, a proposed mission called [[Project M (NASA)|Project M]] was announced by [[Lyndon B.
