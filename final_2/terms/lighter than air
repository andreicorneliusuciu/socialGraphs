Dry air has a density of about 1.29 [[g/L]] (gram per liter) at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]] (STP), and an average molecular mass of 28.97 [[Molar mass|g/mol]].<ref>http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/molecular-mass-air-d_679.html</ref>\n\nSome of these gases are used as [[lifting gas]]es in [[aerostat|lighter-than-air aircraft]], which include [[balloon (aircraft)|free balloons]], [[moored balloon]]s, and [[airships]], to make the whole craft, on average, lighter than air.  (Heavier-than-air [[aircraft]] include [[airplane]]s, gliders and helicopters).\n\n==Usage as lifting gas==\n{{main|Lifting gas}}\n\n=== Hot air ===\n[[Hot air balloon|Hot air]] is frequently used in recreational ballooning. Hot air is lighter than air at ambient temperature, to a degree which can be approximated using the [[ideal gas law]].\n\n=== Neon ===\n[[Neon]] (density 0.900 g/L at STP, average atomic mass 20.17g/mol) is lighter than air and will lift a balloon. However, it is relatively rare on Earth, expensive, and is among the heavier of the lifting gases.\n\n=== Water vapor ===\n[[Water vapor]] (density 0.804 g/L at STP, average molecular mass 18.015 g/mol) is lighter than air, and has successfully been used as a lifting gas. It is generally impractical due to high boiling point and condensation.\n\n===Ammonia===\n[[Ammonia]] (density 0.769 g/L at STP,<ref>http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/gas-density-d_158.html</ref> average molecular mass 17.03 g/mol) has sometimes been used to fill [[weather balloon]]s. Due to its relatively high boiling point (compared to helium and hydrogen), ammonia could potentially be refrigerated and liquified aboard an airship to reduce lift and add ballast (and returned to a gas to add lift and reduce ballast).\n\n===Methane===\n[[Methane]] (density 0.716 g/L at STP, average molecular mass 16.04 g/mol) is the chief component of [[natural gas]] and is sometimes used as a lift gas when hydrogen and helium are not available. It has the advantage of not leaking through balloon walls as rapidly as the small-moleculed hydrogen and helium. Many lighter-than-air balloons are made of aluminized plastic that limits such leakage; hydrogen and helium leak rapidly through latex balloons.\n\n===Hydrogen and helium===\n[[Hydrogen]] (density 0.090 g/L at STP, average molecular mass 2.016 g/mol) and [[helium]] (density 0.179 g/L at STP, average molecular mass 4.003 g/mol) are the most commonly used lift gases. Although helium is twice as heavy as (diatomic) hydrogen, they are both so much lighter than air that this difference only results in hydrogen having 8% more [[buoyancy]] than helium.\n\nIn a practical dirigible design, the difference is significant, making a 50% difference in the fuel-carrying capacity of the dirigible and hence increasing its range significantly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,786149-2,00.html |title=AERONAUTICS: Helium vs. Hydrogen |publisher=TIME |date=1924-03-10 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref>\n\nHelium has an advantage, however, in that combustion is impossible, whereas hydrogen is extremely flammable, as demonstrated by the [[Hindenburg disaster]].\n\n== Others ==\n\n=== Nitrogen ===\n[[Nitrogen]] gas (density 1.251 g/L at STP, average atomic mass 28.00 g/mol) is about 3% lighter than air, insufficient for common use as a lifting gas.\n\n=== Reactive ===\n[[Hydrogen fluoride]] is impractical to be used as a lifting gas because it is highly reactive and extremely toxic.\n\n[[Boron]] can be combined with hydrogen, but [[Borane]] (boron hydride) forms [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]]s and clusters rather than a [[monomer]]. [[Diborane]] is a little bit lighter than air, but will explode spontaneously when mixed with air.\n\n=== Solids ===\nIn 2002, [[aerogel]] held the [[Guinness World Record]] for the least dense (lightest) solid.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2002/TECH/space/05/09/record.gel/index.html CNN]</ref>  Aerogel is mostly air because its structure is like that of a highly vacuous [[sponge]].<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHnen2nSmDY Quest Lab]</ref> Therefore, the lightness and low [[density]] is due primarily to the large proportion of air within the solid and not the [[silicon]] construction materials.  Taking advantage of this, [[SEAgel]], in the same family as aerogel but made from [[agar]], can be filled with  helium  gas to create a solid which floats when placed in an open top container filled with a dense gas.<ref name=\"Discovery Channel\">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoCAxS4vqwQ Discovery Channel]</ref>\n\nIn 2012, discovery of [[aerographite]] was announced, breaking the record for the least dense material at only 0.2&nbsp;mg/cm<sup>3</sup> (0.2&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2012-07-carbon-nanotube-struructure-aerographite-lightest.html |title=New carbon nanotube struructure aerographite is lightest material champ |doi=10.1002/adma.201200491 |publisher=Phys.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/technik/aerographit-leichtestes-material-der-welt-entwickelt-a-843819.html |title=Aerographit: Leichtestes Material der Welt entwickelt - SPIEGEL ONLINE |publisher=Spiegel.de |language=de |date=2012-07-11 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref>\n\nNote that the above solids do not float in air because the hollow spaces in them become filled with air.
