Built in the United States by [[Rocketdyne]], the RS-25 burns [[Cryogenic fuel|cryogenic]] [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen]] propellants, with each engine producing {{convert|1859|kN|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} of [[thrust]] at liftoff. Although the RS-25 can trace its heritage back to the 1960s, concerted development of the engine began in the 1970s, with the first flight, [[STS-1]], occurring on April 12, 1981. The RS-25 has undergone several upgrades over its operational history to improve the engine's reliability, safety and maintenance load.\n\nThe engine produces a [[specific impulse]] (''I''<sub>sp</sub>) of {{convert|452|isp}} in a vacuum, or {{convert|366|isp}} at sea level, has a mass of approximately {{convert|3.5|t|lb|abbr=off}}, and is capable of throttling between 67% and 109% of its rated power level in one-percent increments. The RS-25 operates at temperatures ranging from {{convert|-253|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} to 3300&nbsp;\u00b0C (6000&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref name= \"aerojet\" />\n\nOn the Space Shuttle, the RS-25 was used in clusters of three engines mounted in the aft structure of the [[Space Shuttle orbiter|orbiter]], with fuel being drawn from the [[Space Shuttle External Tank|external tank]]. The engines were used for propulsion during the entirety of the spacecraft's ascent, with additional thrust being provided by two [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters]] and the orbiter's two [[AJ10|AJ10-190]] [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|orbital maneuvering system]] engines.

The orbiter's three engines are visible, each supplied by a fuel line (indicated in red) and an oxidizer line (indicated in blue). In each system, the three lines split off from a main line which disappears into the base of the structure towards where the external tank would be, as indicated by a smaller diagram in the bottom-right of the diagram. Finally, a small fill and drain line branches off each main line, with the two lines exiting the aft structure on opposite sides.]]-->\nThe RS-25 engine consists of various pumps, valves and other components which work in concert to produce thrust. [[Rocket propellant|Fuel]] ([[liquid hydrogen]]) and [[oxidizing agent|oxidizer]] ([[liquid oxygen]]) from the Space Shuttle external tank entered the [[Space Shuttle Orbiter|orbiter]] at the [[Space Shuttle external tank#Hardware|umbilical disconnect valves]], and from there flowed through the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS) feed lines; whereas in the [[Space Launch System]] (SLS), fuel and oxidizer from the rocket's core stage will flow directly into the MPS lines. Once in the MPS lines, the fuel and oxidizer each branch out into separate paths to each engine (three on the Space Shuttle, four on the SLS). In each branch, prevalves then allow the propellants to enter the engine.<ref name=\"2.16\">{{cite web|url=http://www.shuttlepresskit.com/scom/216.pdf|title=Main Propulsion System (MPS)|format=PDF|publisher=Boeing, NASA & United Space Alliance|work=Shuttle Press Kit.com|date=October 6, 1998|accessdate=December 7, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204133938/http://www.shuttlepresskit.com/scom/216.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-04}}</ref><ref name=\"NSFSLS\"/>\n\nOnce in the engine, the propellants flow through low-pressure fuel and oxidizer [[turbopump]]s (LPFTP and LPOTP), and from there into high-pressure turbopumps (HPFTP and HPOTP). From these HPTPs the propellants take different routes through the engine. The oxidizer is split into four separate paths: to the oxidizer [[heat exchanger]], which then splits into the oxidizer tank pressurization and [[Pogo oscillation|pogo]] suppression systems; to the low pressure oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP); to the high pressure oxidizer preburner, from which it is split into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited in the hot gas manifold and sent on to the main combustion chamber (MCC); or directly into the main combustion chamber (MCC) injectors.\n\nMeanwhile, fuel flows through the main fuel valve into [[Regenerative cooling (rocket)|regenerative cooling]] systems for the [[rocket engine nozzle|nozzle]] and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank pressurization system or to the hot gas manifold cooling system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via preburners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.<ref name=\"2.16\"/>\n\n===Turbopumps===\n\n====Oxidizer system====\nThe low-pressure oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP) is an [[axial flow pump|axial-flow pump]] which operates at approximately 5,150 [[rpm]] driven by a six-stage [[turbine]] powered by high-pressure liquid oxygen from the high-pressure oxidizer turbopump (HPOTP). It boosts the liquid oxygen's pressure from {{convert|0.7|to|2.9|MPa|psi|abbr=on}}, with the flow from the LPOTP then being supplied to the HPOTP. During engine operation, the pressure boost permits the high-pressure oxidizer turbine to operate at high speeds without [[cavitation|cavitating]]. The LPOTP, which measures approximately {{convert|450|by|450|mm|in|abbr=on}}, is connected to the vehicle propellant ducting and supported in a fixed position by being mounted on the launch vehicle's structure.<ref name=\"2.16\"/>\n\nThe HPOTP consists of two single-stage [[centrifugal pump]]s (a main pump and a preburner pump) mounted on a common shaft and driven by a two-stage, hot-gas turbine. The main pump boosts the liquid oxygen's pressure from {{convert|2.9|to|30|MPa|psi|abbr=on}} while operating at approximately 28,120&nbsp;rpm, giving a power output of {{convert|23260|hp|MW|abbr=on|link=on}}. The HPOTP discharge flow splits into several paths, one of which drives the LPOTP turbine. Another path is to, and through, the main oxidizer valve and enters the main combustion chamber. Another small flow path is tapped off and sent to the oxidizer [[heat exchanger]]. The liquid oxygen flows through an anti-flood valve that prevents it from entering the heat exchanger until sufficient heat is present for the heat exchanger to utilize the heat contained in the gases discharged from the HPOTP turbine, converting the liquid oxygen to gas. The gas is sent to a manifold and then routed to pressurize the liquid oxygen tank. Another path enters the HPOTP second-stage preburner pump to boost the liquid oxygen's pressure from 30 to 51 MPa (4,300 [[Pounds per square inch|psia]] to 7,400 psia). It passes through the oxidizer preburner oxidizer valve into the oxidizer preburner, and through the fuel preburner oxidizer valve into the fuel preburner. The HPOTP measures approximately {{convert|600|by|900|mm|in|abbr=on}}. It is attached by flanges to the hot-gas manifold.<ref name=\"2.16\"/>\n\nThe HPOTP turbine and HPOTP pumps are mounted on a common shaft. Mixing of the fuel-rich hot gases in the turbine section and the liquid oxygen in the main pump can create a hazard and, to prevent this, the two sections are separated by a cavity that is continuously purged by the engine's helium supply during engine operation. Two seals minimize leakage into the cavity; one seal is located between the turbine section and the cavity, while the other is between the pump section and cavity. Loss of helium pressure in this cavity results in automatic engine shutdown.<ref name=\"2.16\"/>\n\n====Fuel system====\nThe low-pressure fuel turbopump (LPFTP) is an axial-flow pump driven by a two-stage turbine powered by gaseous hydrogen. It boosts the pressure of the liquid hydrogen from 30 to 276 psia (0.2 to 1.9 MPa) and supplies it to the high-pressure fuel turbopump (HPFTP). During engine operation, the pressure boost provided by the LPFTP permits the HPFTP to operate at high speeds without cavitating. The LPFTP operates at around 16,185 [[rpm]], and is approximately {{convert|450|by|600|mm|in|abbr=on}} in size. It is connected to the vehicle propellant ducting and is supported in a fixed position by being mounted to the launch vehicle's structure.<ref name=\"2.16\"/>\n\nThe HPFTP is a three-stage centrifugal pump driven by a two-stage hot-gas turbine. It boosts the pressure of the liquid hydrogen from 1.9 to 45 MPa (276 to 6,515 psia), and operates at approximately 35,360&nbsp;rpm with a power of 71,140&nbsp;hp. The discharge flow from the turbopump is routed to, and through, the main valve and is then split into three flow paths. One path is through the jacket of the main combustion chamber, where the hydrogen is used to cool the chamber walls. It is then routed from the main combustion chamber to the LPFTP, where it is used to drive the LPFTP turbine. A small portion of the flow from the LPFTP is then directed to a common manifold from all three engines to form a single path to the liquid hydrogen tank to maintain pressurization. The remaining hydrogen passes between the inner and outer walls of the hot-gas manifold to cool it and is then discharged into the main combustion chamber. A second hydrogen flow path from the main fuel valve is through the engine nozzle (to cool the nozzle). It then joins the third flow path from the chamber coolant valve. This combined flow is then directed to the fuel and oxidizer preburners. The HPFTP is approximately {{convert|550|by|1100|mm|in|abbr=on}} in size and is attached to the hot-gas manifold by flanges.<ref name=\"2.16\"/>\n\n===Powerhead===\n\n====Preburners====\n<!--[[File:SSME powerhead.jpg|thumb|The RS-25's powerhead and high-pressure pumps.|alt=A diagram showing the RS-25's powerhead and high-pressure pumps. See adjacent text for details.]]-->\nThe oxidizer and fuel preburners are [[welded]] to the hot-gas manifold. The fuel and oxidizer enter the preburners and are mixed so that efficient combustion can occur. The augmented [[Electric arc|spark]] igniter is a small combination chamber located in the center of the injector of each preburner. The two dual-redundant spark igniters, which are activated by the engine controller, are used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion in each preburner. They are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is then self-sustaining. The preburners produce the fuel-rich hot gases that pass through the turbines to generate the power needed to operate the high-pressure turbopumps. The oxidizer preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPOTP and to the oxidizer preburner pump. The fuel preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPFTP.<ref name=\"2.16\"/>\n\nThe speed of the HPOTP and HPFTP turbines depends on the position of the corresponding oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves. These valves are positioned by the engine controller, which uses them to throttle the flow of liquid oxygen to the preburners and, thus, control engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves increase or decrease the liquid oxygen flow, thus increasing or decreasing preburner chamber pressure, HPOTP and HPFTP turbine speed, and liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen flow into the main combustion chamber, which increases or decreases engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner valves operate together to throttle the engine and maintain a constant 6.03:1 propellant mixture ratio.<ref name=\"P&WFS\"/>\n\nThe main oxidizer and main fuel valves control the flow of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen into the engine and are controlled by each engine controller. When an engine is operating, the main valves are fully open.<ref name=\"2.16\"/>\n\n====Main combustion chamber====\nEach engine main combustion chamber (MCC) receives fuel-rich hot gas from a hot-gas manifold cooling circuit. The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the injector, which mixes the propellants. A small augmented-spark igniter-chamber is located in the center of the injector, and this dual-redundant igniter is used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion. The igniters are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is self-sustaining. The main injector and dome assembly is welded to the hot-gas manifold, and the MCC is also bolted to the hot-gas manifold.<ref name=\"2.16\"/> The MCC comprises a structural shell made of [[Inconel|Inconel 718]] which is lined with a [[copper]]-[[silver]]-[[zirconium]] [[alloy]] called NARloy-Z, developed specifically for the RS-25 in the 1970s. Around 390 channels are machined into the liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through the liner to provide MCC cooling, as the temperature in the combustion chamber reaches 3300&nbsp;\u00b0C (6000&nbsp;\u00b0F) during flight \u2013 higher than the [[boiling point]] of [[iron]].<ref name=\"NARloy-Z\">{{cite web|url=http://www.copper.org/publications/newsletters/cutopics/Ct73/shuttle_engine.html|year=1992|title=NASA Relies on Copper for Shuttle Engine|work=Discover Copper Online|publisher=Copper Development Association|accessdate=January 19, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Enhancements\"/>\n\n===Nozzle===\n[[File:SSME1.jpg|thumb|upright|The nozzles of {{OV|102}}'s three RS-25s following the landing of [[STS-93]]|alt=Three bell-shaped rocket engine nozzles projecting from the aft structure of a Space Shuttle orbiter.

However, to aid the engine's operation  Rocketdyne engineers varied the angle of the nozzle walls, reducing it near the exit. This raises the pressure just around the rim to an absolute pressure between {{convert|4.6|and|5.7|psi|abbr=on}}, and prevents flow separation. The inner part of the flow is at much lower pressure, around {{convert|2|psi|abbr=on}} or less.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.k-makris.gr/RocketTechnology/Nozzle_Design/nozzle_design.htm|title=Nozzle Design|accessdate=November 23, 2011|date=March 16, 2009}}</ref> The inner surface of each nozzle is cooled by liquid hydrogen flowing through [[brazing|brazed]] stainless steel tube wall coolant passages.

The failure of controller system A automatically leads to a switch-over to controller system B without impeding operational capabilities; the subsequent failure of controller system B would provide a graceful shutdown of the engine. Within each system (A and B), the two M68000s operate in \"lock-step\", thereby enabling each system to detect failures by comparing the signal levels on the buses of the two M68000 processors within that system. If differences are encountered between the two buses, then an interrupt is generated and control turned over to the other system. Because of subtle differences between M68000s from Motorola and the second source manufacturer [[TRW Inc.|TRW]], each system uses M68000s from the same manufacturer (for instance system A would have two Motorola CPUs while system B would have two CPUs manufactured by TRW).

In an emergency, the valves can be fully closed by using the engine's helium supply system as a backup actuation system.<ref name=\"2.16\"/>\n\nIn the Space Shuttle the main oxidizer and fuel bleed valves were used after shutdown to dump any residual propellant, with residual liquid oxygen venting through the engine and residual liquid hydrogen venting through the liquid hydrogen fill and drain valves. After the dump was completed, the valves closed and remain closed for the remainder of the mission.<ref name=\"2.16\"/>\n\nA [[coolant]] control valve is mounted on the combustion chamber coolant bypass duct of each engine. The engine controller regulates the amount of gaseous hydrogen allowed to bypass the nozzle coolant loop, thus controlling its temperature. The chamber coolant valve is 100% open before engine start. During engine operation, it is 100% open for throttle settings of 100 to 109% for maximum cooling. For throttle settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.<ref name=\"2.16\"/>\n\n===Gimbal===\n{{external media|width=|video1=[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Wtg_3Y4lFc SSME gimbal test]}}\nEach engine is installed with a [[gimbal]] [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]], a universal [[ball and socket joint]] which is bolted to the launch vehicle by its upper [[flange]] and to the engine by its lower flange.

The studies were conducted under a program to upgrade the Saturn V engines, which produced a design for a 350,000&nbsp;[[pound (force)|lb<sub>f</sub>]] upper-stage engine known as the [[HG-3 (rocket engine)|HG-3]].<ref name=\"HG-3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/engines/hg3.htm|title=HG-3|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|author=Mark Wade|accessdate=December 13, 2011}}</ref> As funding levels for Apollo wound down the HG-3 was cancelled as well as the upgraded [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1 engines]] already being tested.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/nasa_techdoc_19740077747/19740077747_djvu.txt|title=(NASA-CR-138312) F-LA TASK ASSIGNMENT  PROGRAM final Report, (Rocketdyne)]</ref> It was the design for the HG-3 that would form the basis for the RS-25.<ref name=\"RS-25MSFC\">{{cite web|url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/saturn_apollo/propulsion_center.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=December 13, 2011|title=MSFC Propulsion Center of Excellence is Built on Solid Foundation|year=1995}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, in 1967, the [[US Air Force]] funded a study into advanced rocket propulsion systems for use during [[Project Isinglass]], with Rocketdyne asked to investigate [[aerospike engine|aerospike]] engines and [[Pratt & Whitney]] (P&W) to research more efficient conventional [[de Laval nozzle]]-type engines.

However, NASA was interested in pushing the [[state of the art]] in every way, they decided to select a much more advanced design in order to \"force an advancement of rocket engine technology\".<ref name=\"SSMEFTY\"/><ref name=\"Haynes\"/> They called for a new design based on a high-pressure combustion chamber running around 3000&nbsp;psi, which increases the performance of the engine.\n\nDevelopment began in 1970, when NASA released a [[request for proposal]] for 'Phase B' main engine concept studies, requiring development of a throttleable, [[Staged combustion cycle (rocket)|staged combustion]], de Laval-type engine.<ref name=\"SSMEFTY\"/><ref name=\"Haynes\"/> The request was based on the then-current design of the Space Shuttle which featured two reusable stages, the orbiter and a manned fly-back booster, and required one engine which would be able to power both vehicles via two different nozzles (12 booster engines with 550,000&nbsp;lb<sub>f</sub> sea level thrust each and 3 orbiter engines with 632,000&nbsp;lb<sub>f</sub> vacuum thrust each).<ref name=\"SSMEFTY\"/> Rocketdyne, P&W and [[Aerojet|Aerojet General]] were selected to receive funding although, given P&W's already-advanced development (demonstrating a working 350,000&nbsp;lb<sub>f</sub> concept engine during the year) and Aerojet General's prior experience in developing the 1,500,000&nbsp;lb<sub>f</sub> M-1 engine, Rocketdyne was forced to put a large amount of private money into the design process to allow the company to catch up to its competitors.<ref name=\"Haynes\"/>\n\nBy the time the contract was awarded, budgetary pressures meant that the shuttle's design had changed to its final orbiter, external tank and two boosters configuration, and so the engine was only required to power the orbiter during ascent.<ref name=\"SSMEFTY\"/> During the year-long 'Phase B' study period, Rocketdyne was able to make use of their experience developing the HG-3 engine to design their SSME proposal, producing a prototype by January 1971. The engine made use of a new Rocketdyne-developed [[copper]]-[[zirconium]] alloy (called NARloy-Z), and was tested on February 12, 1971, producing a chamber pressure of 3172&nbsp;psi. The three participating companies submitted their engine development bids in April 1971, with Rocketdyne being awarded the contract on July 13, 1971\u2014although work did not begin on engine development until March 31, 1972, due to a legal challenge from P&W.<ref name=\"SSMEFTY\"/><ref name=\"Haynes\"/>\n\nFollowing the awarding of the contract, a preliminary design review was carried out in September 1972, followed by a critical design review in September 1976 after which the engine's design was set and construction of the first set of flight-capable engines began. Final review of all the Space Shuttle's components, including the engines, was conducted in 1979. The design reviews operated in parallel with several test milestones, initial tests consisting of individual engine components which identified shortcomings with various areas of the design, including the HPFTP, HPOTP, valves, nozzle and fuel preburners. The individual engine component tests were followed by the first test of a complete engine (0002) on March 16, 1977. NASA specified that, prior to the Shuttle's first flight, the engines must have undergone at least 65,000 seconds of testing, a milestone that was reached on March 23, 1980, with the engine having undergone 110,253 seconds of testing by the time of [[STS-1]] both on test stands at [[John C. Stennis Space Center|Stennis Space Center]] and installed on the [[MPTA-098|Main Propulsion Test Article]] (MPTA). The first set of engines (2005, 2006 and 2007) were delivered to [[Kennedy Space Center]] in 1979 and installed on {{OV|102|full=no}}, before being removed in 1980 for further testing and reinstalled on the orbiter. The engines, which were of the first manned orbital flight (FMOF) configuration and certified for operation at 100% rated power level (RPL), were operated in a twenty-second flight readiness firing on February 20, 1981, and, after inspection, declared ready for flight.<ref name=\"SSMEFTY\"/>\n\n===Space Shuttle program===\n{{See also|List of space shuttle missions}}\n[[File:020408 STS110 Atlantis launch.jpg|thumb|{{OV|104}}'s three RS-25D main engines at liftoff during [[STS-110]]|alt=Three bell-shaped rocket engine nozzles projecting from the aft structure of a Space Shuttle orbiter.

The view cuts to a wide shot of the launchpad, before moving back to the original view, at which point large jets of water can be seen pouring into the flame trench beneath the shuttle. The video then moves to a view from underneath the stack, showing the three RS-25 engines mounted in the orbiter in slow motion. Orange sparks begin to project from service structures either side of the engines, then the video changes to a quartered view, with shots of both sides of the engine cluster and a clock. The engines then ignite, in the sequence right, left, top. At first, the engines burn with a yellow flame, but the flames then progress through white and blue, eventually forming perfect cones with mach discs visible lower in the plume.

The movement of the top of the stack as this occurs is shown next, followed by the retraction of the umbilicals mounted either side of the orbiter's aft structure and to the external tank, the ignition of the shuttle's solid rocket boosters, and the liftoff of the stack. Several views of the first stage ascent, including SRB separation, are then shown. Next the view changes to a view from another external tank camera pointing aft, showing the engines' plume, in the form of a large white ring, glowing around the aft of the shuttle. This gradually fades as the engines throttle back and shut down, before the orbiter separates from the external tank, accompanied by bright thruster firings. Finally, the video fades and is replaced by another logo.]]\nEach Space Shuttle had three RS-25 engines, installed in the aft structure of the [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] in the [[Orbiter Processing Facility]] prior to the orbiter being transferred to the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]].

Block I improvements also included a new, two-duct powerhead (rather than the original design, which featured three ducts connected to the HPFTP and two to the HPOTP), which helped improve hot gas flow, and an improved engine heat exchanger.\n*Block IA (RS-25B) \u2013 First flown on [[STS-73]], the Block IA engine offered main injector improvements.\n*Block IIA (RS-25C) \u2013 First flown on [[STS-89]], the Block IIA engine was an interim model used whilst certain components of the Block II engine completed development. Changes included a new large throat main combustion chamber (which had originally been recommended by Rocketdyne in 1980), improved low pressure turbopumps and certification for 104.5% RPL to compensate for a {{convert|2|isp}} reduction in [[specific impulse]] (original plans called for the engine to be certified to 106% for heavy [[International Space Station]] payloads, but this was not required and would have reduced engine service life). A slightly modified version first flew on [[STS-96]].\n*Block II (RS-25D) \u2013 First flown on [[STS-104]], the Block II upgrade included all of the Block IIA improvements plus a new high pressure fuel turbopump.

Whilst the FMOF engine had a maximum output of 100% RPL, Block II engines could throttle as high as 109% or 111% in an emergency, with usual flight performance being 104.5%. These increases in throttle level made a significant difference to the thrust produced by the engine:<ref name=\"Orientation\"/><ref name=\"Hale\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! || Sea level || Vacuum\n|-\n! 100% thrust\n| {{convert|1670|kN|abbr=on}} || {{convert|2090|kN|abbr=on}}\n|-\n! 104.5% thrust\n| {{convert|1750|kN|abbr=on}} || {{convert|2170|kN|abbr=on}}\n|-\n! 109% thrust\n| {{convert|1860|kN|abbr=on}} || {{convert|2280|kN|abbr=on}}\n|}\nSpecifying power levels over 100% may seem nonsensical, but there was a logic behind it. The 100% level does not mean the maximum physical power level attainable, rather it was a specification decided on during engine development\u2014the expected rated power level. When later studies indicated the engine could operate safely at levels above 100%, these higher levels became standard. Maintaining the original relationship of power level to physical thrust helps reduce confusion, as it created an unvarying fixed relationship so that test data (or operational data from past or future missions) can be easily compared. If the power level was increased, and that new value was said to be 100%, then all previous data and documentation would either require changing, or cross-checking against what physical thrust corresponded to 100% power level on that date.<ref name=\"SSMEFTY\"/> Engine power level affects engine reliability, with studies indicating the probability of an engine failure increasing rapidly with power levels over 104.5%, which was why power levels above 104.5% were retained for contingency use only.<ref name=\"SSMEAT\"/>\n\n====Incidents====\nDuring the course of the Space Shuttle program, a total of 46 RS-25 engines were used (with one extra RS-25D being built but never used).

Following [[Multistage rocket|staging]], the engines are discarded along with the rest of the core stage.\n\nFollowing the [[Space Shuttle retirement|retirement of the Space Shuttle]], NASA announced on September 14, 2011, that it would be developing a new launch vehicle, known as the [[Space Launch System]] (SLS), to replace the shuttle fleet.<ref name=\"SLSPR\">{{cite web|publisher=NASA|accessdate=December 14, 2011|title=NASA Announces Design For New Deep Space Exploration System|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2011/sep/HQ_11-301_SLS_Decision.html}}</ref> The design for the SLS features the RS-25 on its core stage, with different versions of the rocket being installed with between three and five engines.<ref name=\"NSFTrades\">{{cite web|publisher=NASASpaceflight.com|author=Chris Bergin|date=October 4, 2011|accessdate=December 14, 2011|title=SLS trades lean towards opening with four RS-25s on the core stage|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/10/sls-trades-opening-four-rs-25s-core-stage/}}</ref><ref name=\"25DTransition\">{{cite web|publisher=NASASpaceflight.com|author=Chris Bergin|date=January 13, 2012|accessdate=January 16, 2012|title=SSME family prepare for SLS core stage role following Shuttle success|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/01/ssme-family-sls-core-stage-role-shuttle-success/}}</ref> The initial flights of the new launch vehicle will make use of flown Block II RS-25D engines, with NASA keeping the remaining such engines in a \"purged safe\" environment at Stennis Space Center, \"along with all of the ground systems required to maintain them.\"<ref name=aw20110329>{{cite news|last=Carreau|first=Mark|title=NASA Will Retain Block II SSMEs|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&id=news/asd/2011/03/29/08.xml&headline=NASA%20Will%20Retain%20Block%20II%20SSMEs|accessdate=March 30, 2011|newspaper=Aviation Week|date=March 29, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"SLS MPS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/01/engineers-removing-orbiter-mps-components-donation-sls/|accessdate=January 23, 2012|date=January 22, 2012|author=Chris Bergin|publisher=NASASpaceflight.com|title=Engineers begin removing orbiter MPS components for donation to SLS}}</ref> In addition to the RS-25Ds, the SLS program will make use of the Main Propulsion Systems from the three remaining orbiters for testing purposes (having been removed as part of the orbiters' decommissioning), with the first two launches ([[SLS-1]] and [[SLS-2]]) possibly making use of the MPS hardware from Space Shuttles {{OV|104|full=no}} and {{OV|105|full=no}} in their core stages.<ref name=\"25DTransition\"/><ref name=\"SLS MPS\"/><ref name=\"NSFMPS\">{{cite web|publisher=NASASpaceflight.com|author=Chris Bergin|date=September 20, 2011|accessdate=December 14, 2011|title=PRCB managers recommend Atlantis and Endeavour become SLS donors|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/09/prcb-recommend-atlantis-endeavour-become-sls-donors/}}</ref> The SLS's propellants will be supplied to the engines from the rocket's [[Space Launch System#Core stage|core stage]], which will consist of a modified Space Shuttle external tank with the MPS plumbing and engines at its aft, and an [[Space Launch System#Upper stage|interstage]] structure at the top.<ref name=\"NSFSLS\"/> Once the remaining RS-25Ds are used up, they are to be replaced with a cheaper, expendable version, currently designated the RS-25E.<ref name=\"NSFSLS\">{{cite web|publisher=NASASpaceflight.com|author=Chris Bergin|date=September 14, 2011|accessdate=December 14, 2011|title=SLS finally announced by NASA \u2013 Forward path taking shape|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/09/sls-finally-announced-nasa-forward-path/}}</ref> This engine may be based on one or both of two single-use variants which were studied in 2005, the RS-25E (referred to as the 'Minimal Change Expendable SSME') and the even more simplified RS-25F (referred to as the 'Low Cost Manufacture Expendable SSME'), both of which were under consideration in 2011.<ref name=\"Reference Engines\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110009917_2011009273.pdf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=January 23, 2012|date=February 2011|title=NASA Technology Area 1: Launch Propulsion Systems|author=P.
