A [[frequency|complete cycle]] is defined as the interval required for the waveform to return to its arbitrary initial value. The graphic to the right shows how one cycle constitutes 360\u00b0 of phase. The graphic also shows how phase is sometimes expressed in [[radian]]s, where one radian of phase equals approximately 57.3\u00b0.\n\nPhase can also be an expression of [[displacement (vector)|relative displacement]] between two corresponding features (for example, peaks or zero crossings) of two waveforms having the same [[frequency]].<ref name=phnist>\n{{cite web\n | url =http://www.nist.gov/pml/div688/grp40/enc-p.cfm\n | title =Phase\n | last =\"Time and Frequency from A to Z\"\n | first =\n | date =\n | website =\n | publisher =[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST)\n | access-date =12 June 2016\n | quote = }} This content has been copied and pasted from an NIST web page ''and is in the public domain''.</ref>\n\nIn [[sinusoidal]] functions or in waves \"'''phase'''\" has two different, but closely related, meanings.  One is the initial angle of a sinusoidal function at its [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] and is sometimes called '''phase offset''' or '''phase difference'''.  Another usage is the fraction of the wave cycle that has elapsed relative to the origin.<ref name=Ballou2005>{{cite book |last=Ballou |first=Glen |title=Handbook for sound engineers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y0d9VA0lkogC&pg=PA1499 |edition=3 |year=2005 |publisher=Focal Press, Gulf Professional Publishing |isbn=0-240-80758-8 |page=1499}}</ref>\n\n== Phase shift ==<!--Phase shift (waves) redirects here-->\n[[Image:Phase shift.svg|thumb|Illustration of phase shift. The horizontal axis represents an angle (phase) that is increasing with time.]]\n'''Phase shift''' is any change that occurs in the phase of one quantity, or in the phase difference between two or more quantities.<ref name=Ballou2005/>\n\nThis symbol: <math>\\varphi\\,</math> is sometimes referred to as a ''phase shift'' or ''phase offset'', because it represents a \"shift\" from zero phase.\n\nFor infinitely long sinusoids, a change in <math>\\varphi\\,</math> is the same as a shift in time, such as a time delay. If <math>\\scriptstyle x(t)\\,</math> is delayed (time-shifted) by <math>\\scriptstyle \\frac{1}{4}\\,</math> of its cycle, it becomes:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx\\left(t - \\tfrac{1}{4} T\\right) &= A\\cdot \\cos\\left(2 \\pi f \\left(t - \\tfrac{1}{4}T \\right) + \\varphi \\right) \\\\\n                                  &= A\\cdot \\cos\\left(2 \\pi f t - \\tfrac{\\pi}{2} + \\varphi \\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhose \"phase\" is now <math>\\scriptstyle \\varphi \\,-\\, \\frac{\\pi}{2}</math>.  It has been shifted by <math>\\scriptstyle \\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> radians.\n\n== Phase difference {{anchor|Phase difference}} ==\n[[Image:Sine waves same phase.svg|thumb|In-phase waves]]\n[[Image:Sine waves different phase.svg|thumb|Out-of-phase waves]]\n[[File:Phase Comparison image two waves.gif|thumb|Representation of phase comparison.<ref name=phnist/>]]\n[[Image:Phase-shift illustration.png||thumb|200px|Left: the [[real part]] of a [[plane wave]] moving from top to bottom. Right: the same wave after a central section underwent a phase shift, for example, by passing through a glass of different thickness than the other parts.]]\n\n'''Phase difference''' is the difference, expressed in degrees or time, between two waves having the same frequency and referenced to the same point in time.<ref name=Ballou2005/> Two oscillators that have the same frequency and no phase difference are said to be '''in phase'''. Two oscillators that have the same frequency and different phases have a phase difference, and the oscillators are said to be '''out of phase''' with each other.\n\nThe amount by which such oscillators are out of phase with each other can be expressed in [[degree (angle)|degrees]] from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0, or in [[radian]]s from 0 to 2\u03c0. If the phase difference is 180 degrees (\u03c0 radians), then the two oscillators are said to be in '''antiphase'''. If two interacting [[wave]]s meet at a point where they are in antiphase, then destructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] will occur. It is common for waves of electromagnetic (light, RF), acoustic (sound) or other energy to become superposed in their transmission medium.  When that happens, the phase difference determines whether they reinforce or weaken each other.  Complete cancellation is possible for waves with equal amplitudes.\n\nTime is sometimes used (instead of angle) to express position within the cycle of an oscillation. A phase difference is analogous to two athletes running around a race track at the same speed and direction but starting at different positions on the track. They pass a point at different instants in time. But the time difference (phase difference) between them is a constant - same for every pass since they are at the same speed and in the same direction. If they were at different speeds (different frequencies), the phase difference is undefined and would only reflect different starting positions. Technically, phase difference between two entities at various frequencies is undefined and does not exist.\n* Time zones are also analogous to phase differences.\n\nA real-world example of a sonic phase difference occurs in the [[Native American flute#The Warble|warble of a Native American flute]]. The amplitude of different [[Harmonics|harmonic components]] of same long-held note on the flute come into dominance at different points in the phase cycle.\nThe phase difference between the different harmonics can be observed on a [[spectrogram]] of the sound of a warbling flute.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://Flutopedia.com/warble.htm |title=The Warble |work=Flutopedia |author1=Clint Goss |author2=Barry Higgins |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref>\n\n===Phase comparison===\n'''Phase comparison''' is a comparison of the phase of two waveforms, usually of the same nominal frequency. In time and frequency, the purpose of a phase comparison is generally to determine the frequency offset (difference between wave cycles) with respect to a reference.<ref name=phnist/>\n\nA phase comparison can be made by connecting two signals to a [[oscilloscope|two-channel oscilloscope]]. The oscilloscope will display two sine waves, as shown in the graphic to the right. In the adjacent image, the top sine wave is the [[frequency|test frequency]], and the bottom sine wave represents a signal from the reference.\n\nIf the two frequencies were exactly the same, their phase relationship would not change and both would appear to be stationary on the oscilloscope display. Since the two frequencies are not exactly the same, the reference appears to be stationary and the test signal moves. By measuring the rate of motion of the test signal the offset between frequencies can be determined.\n\nVertical lines have been drawn through the points where each sine wave passes through zero. The bottom of the figure shows bars whose width represents the phase difference between the signals. In this case the phase difference is increasing, indicating that the test signal is lower in frequency than the reference.<ref name=phnist/>\n\n==Formula for phase of an oscillation or a wave==\nThe phase of an [[Simple harmonic motion|oscillation]] or [[Sine wave|wave]] refers to a sinusoidal function such as the following:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx(t) &= A\\cdot \\cos( 2 \\pi f t + \\varphi ) \\\\\ny(t) &= A\\cdot \\sin( 2 \\pi f t + \\varphi ) = A\\cdot \\cos\\left( 2 \\pi f t + \\varphi - \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\scriptstyle A\\,</math>, <math>\\scriptstyle f\\,</math>, and <math>\\scriptstyle \\varphi\\,</math> are constant parameters called the ''amplitude'', ''frequency'', and ''phase'' of the sinusoid.  These functions are periodic with period <math>\\scriptstyle T = \\frac{1}{f}\\,</math>, and they are identical except for a displacement of <math>\\scriptstyle \\frac{T}{4}\\,</math> along the <math>\\scriptstyle t\\,</math> axis.  The term '''phase''' can refer to several different things''':'''\n* It can refer to a specified reference, such as <math>\\scriptstyle \\cos( 2 \\pi f t)\\,</math>, in which case we would say the '''phase''' of <math>\\scriptstyle x(t)\\,</math> is <math>\\scriptstyle \\varphi\\,</math>, and the '''phase''' of <math>\\scriptstyle y(t)\\,</math> is <math>\\scriptstyle \\varphi\\,-\\, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\,</math>.\n* It can refer to <math>\\scriptstyle \\varphi\\,</math>, in which case we would say <math>\\scriptstyle x(t)\\,</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle y(t)\\,</math> have the same '''phase''' but are relative to their own specific references.\n* In the context of communication waveforms, the time-variant angle <math>\\scriptstyle 2 \\pi f t \\,+\\, \\varphi</math>, or its [[principal value]], is referred to as '''[[instantaneous phase]]''', often just '''phase'''.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[In-phase and quadrature components]]\n* [[Instantaneous phase]]\n* [[Lissajous curve]]\n* [[Phase angle]]\n* [[Phase cancellation]]\n* [[Phase problem]]\n* [[Phase velocity]]\n* [[Phasor]]\n* [[Polarity (physics)|Polarity]]\n* [[Polarization (waves)|Polarization]]\n* [[coherence (physics)|Coherence]], the quality of a wave to display a well defined phase relationship in different regions of its domain of definition\n* [[Absolute phase]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Phase (waves)}}\n* \"[http://www.indiana.edu/~emusic/acoustics/phase.htm What is a phase?]\".
