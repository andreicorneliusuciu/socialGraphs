Nicol |title=Discrete-Event System Simulation |publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2001 | page=3 |isbn=0-13-088702-1 }}</ref> The act of simulating something first requires that a model be developed; this model represents the key characteristics or behaviors/[[Function (engineering)|function]]s of the selected physical or abstract system or process.  The model represents the system itself, whereas the simulation represents the operation of the system over time.\n\nSimulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of [[technology]] for performance optimization, [[safety engineering]], [[Experiment|testing]], [[training]], [[education]], and [[video game]]s.  Often, [[computer experiment]]s are used to study simulation models. Simulation is also used with [[scientific modelling]] of natural systems or human systems to gain insight into their functioning.<ref>In the words of the [http://www.modelbenders.com/encyclopedia/encyclopedia.html Simulation article] in Encyclopedia of Computer Science, \"designing a model of a real or imagined system and conducting experiments with that model\".</ref> Simulation can be used to show the eventual real effects of alternative conditions and courses of action.  Simulation is also used when the real system cannot be engaged, because it may not be accessible, or it may be dangerous or unacceptable to engage, or it is being designed but not yet built, or it may simply not exist.<ref>{{cite book |author=Sokolowski, J.A. |author2=Banks, C.M. |title=Principles of Modeling and Simulation |publisher=Wiley |location=Hoboken, NJ |year=2009 |page=6 |isbn=978-0-470-28943-3 }}</ref>\n\nKey issues in simulation include acquisition of valid source information about the relevant selection of key characteristics and behaviours, the use of simplifying approximations and assumptions within the simulation, and fidelity and validity of the simulation outcomes. Procedures and protocols for [[Verification and validation of computer simulation models|model verification and validation]] are an ongoing field of academic study, refinement, research and development in simulations technology or practice, particularly in the field of [[computer simulation]]. \n\n==Classification and terminology==\n[[File:Christer Fuglesang underwater EVA simulation for STS-116.jpg|thumb|Human-in-the-loop simulation of [[outer space]]]] [[File:lambda2 scherschicht.png|thumb|right|Visualization of a [[direct numerical simulation]] model.]]\n\nHistorically, simulations used in different fields developed largely independently, but 20th century studies of [[systems theory]] and [[cybernetics]] combined with spreading use of computers across all those fields have led to some unification and a more systematic view of the concept.\n\n''Physical simulation'' refers to simulation in which physical objects are substituted for the real thing (some circles<ref>For example in [[computer graphics]] [http://www.siggraph.org/s2007/attendees/papers/12.html SIGGRAPH 2007 | For Attendees | Papers] [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/BSoD/Physical_Simulation Doc:Tutorials/Physics/BSoD - BlenderWiki].</ref> use the term for computer simulations modelling selected laws of [[physics]], but this article does not). These physical objects are often chosen because they are smaller or cheaper than the actual object or system.\n\n''Interactive simulation'' is a special kind of physical simulation, often referred to as a ''[[Human-in-the-Loop|human in the loop]]'' simulation, in which physical simulations include human operators, such as in a [[flight simulator]] or a [[driving simulator]].\n\n''Simulation Fidelity'' is used to describe the accuracy of a simulation and how closely it imitates the real-life counterpart. Fidelity is broadly classified as 1 of 3 categories: low, medium, and high. Specific descriptions of fidelity levels are subject to interpretation but the following generalization can be made:\n* Low - the minimum simulation required for a system to respond to accept inputs and provide outputs\n* Medium - responds automatically to stimuli, with limited accuracy\n* High - nearly indistinguishable or as close as possible to the real system\n\nHuman in the loop simulations can include a computer simulation as a so-called ''synthetic environment''.<ref name=\"environment\">[[Thales Group|Thales]] defines synthetic environment as \"the counterpart to simulated models of sensors, platforms and other active objects\" for \"the simulation of the external factors that affect them\"[http://www.thalesresearch.com/Default.aspx?tabid=181] while other vendors use the term for more visual, [[virtual reality]]-style simulators [http://www.cae.com/www2004/Products_and_Services/Civil_Simulation_and_Training/Simulation_Equipment/Visual_Solutions/Synthetic_Environments/index.shtml].</ref>\n\n''Simulation in failure analysis'' refers to simulation in which we create environment/conditions to identify the cause of equipment failure. This was the best and fastest method to identify the failure cause.\n\n==Computer simulation==\n{{Main|Computer simulation}}\nA computer simulation (or \"sim\") is an attempt to model a real-life or hypothetical situation on a computer so that it can be studied to see how the system works. By changing variables in the simulation, [[prediction]]s may be made about the behaviour of the system. It is a tool to virtually investigate the behaviour of the system under study.<ref name=\"definition\"/>\n\nComputer simulation has become a useful part of [[model (abstract)|modeling]] many natural systems in [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]],<ref>For a popular research project in the field of [[biochemistry]] where \"computer simulation is particularly well suited to address these questions\"[http://folding.stanford.edu/Pande/Main Folding@home - Main], see [[Folding@Home]].</ref> and human systems in [[economics]] and [[social science]] (e.g., [[computational sociology]]) as well as in [[engineering]] to gain insight into the operation of those systems.  A good example of the usefulness of using computers to simulate can be found in the field of [[network traffic simulation]]. In such simulations, the [[model (abstract)|model]] behaviour will change each simulation according to the set of initial parameters assumed for the environment.\n\nTraditionally, the formal modeling of systems has been via a [[mathematical model]], which attempts to find analytical solutions enabling the prediction of the behaviour of the system from a set of parameters and initial conditions. Computer simulation is often used as an adjunct to, or substitution for, modeling systems for which simple [[closed-form solution|closed form analytic solutions]] are not possible.  There are many different types of computer simulation, the common feature they all share is the attempt to generate a sample of representative [[scenario]]s for a model in which a complete enumeration of all possible states would be prohibitive or impossible.\n\nSeveral software packages exist for running computer-based simulation modeling (e.g. [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulation, [[stochastic|stochastic modeling]], multimethod modeling) that makes all the modeling almost effortless.\n\nModern usage of the term \"computer simulation\" may encompass virtually any computer-based representation.\n\n===Computer science===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Emulator]] -->\n\nIn [[computer science]], simulation has some specialized meanings: [[Alan Turing]] used the term \"simulation\" to refer to what happens when a [[Universal Turing machine|universal machine]] executes a state transition table (in modern terminology, a computer runs a program) that describes the state transitions, inputs and outputs of a subject discrete-state machine{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; this should be straightforward to confirm.|date=June 2013}}.  The computer simulates the subject machine. Accordingly, in [[theoretical computer science]] the term ''[[simulation preorder|simulation]]'' is a relation between [[state transition system]]s, useful in the study of [[operational semantics]].\n\nLess theoretically, an interesting application of computer simulation is to simulate computers using computers. In [[computer architecture]], a type of simulator, typically called an ''[[emulator]]'', is often used to execute a program that has to run on some inconvenient type of computer (for example, a newly designed computer that has not yet been built or an obsolete computer that is no longer available), or in a tightly controlled testing environment (see ''[[Computer architecture simulator]]'' and ''[[Platform virtualization]]'').  For example, simulators have been used to debug a [[microprogram]] or sometimes commercial application programs, before the program is downloaded to the target machine. Since the operation of the computer is simulated, all of the information about the computer's operation is directly available to the programmer, and the speed and execution of the simulation can be varied at will.\n\nSimulators may also be used to interpret [[fault tree]]s, or test [[VLSI]] logic designs before they are constructed. [[Symbolic simulation]] uses variables to stand for unknown values.\n\nIn the field of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], simulations of physical processes are often used in conjunction with [[evolutionary computation]] to optimize control strategies.\n\n==Simulation in education and training==\n{{Main|Adaptive educational hypermedia}}\nSimulation is extensively used for educational purposes.  It is frequently used by way of [[adaptive hypermedia]].\n\nSimulation is often used in the [[training]] of civilian and military personnel.<ref>For an academic take on a training simulator, see e.g. [http://gel.msu.edu/magerko/papers/11TH-CGF-058.pdf Towards Building an Interactive, Scenario-based Training Simulator], for medical application [http://www.immersion.com/medical/benefits1.php Medical Simulation Training Benefits] as presented by a simulator vendor and for military practice [http://ciponline.org/facts/exe.htm A civilian's guide to US defense and security assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean] published by [[Center for International Policy]].</ref> This usually occurs when it is prohibitively expensive or simply too dangerous to allow trainees to use the real equipment in the real world. In such situations they will spend time learning valuable lessons in a \"safe\" virtual environment yet living a [[lifelike experience]] (or at least it is the goal).  Often the convenience is to permit mistakes during training for a safety-critical system. There is a distinction, though, between simulations used for training and [[Instructional Simulation|Instructional simulation]].\n\n[[Training simulation]]s typically come in one of three categories:<ref>Classification used by the [[Defense Modeling and Simulation Office]].</ref>\n\n* \"live\" simulation (where actual players use genuine systems in a real environment);\n* \"virtual\" simulation (where actual players use simulated systems in a synthetic environment<ref name=\"environment\"/>), or\n* \"constructive\" simulation (where simulated players use simulated systems in a synthetic environment). Constructive simulation is often referred to as \"wargaming\" since it bears some resemblance to table-top [[wargaming|war games]] in which players command armies of soldiers and equipment that move around a board.\n\nIn [[standardized test]]s, \"live\" simulations are sometimes called \"high-fidelity\", producing \"samples of likely performance\", as opposed to \"low-fidelity\", \"pencil-and-paper\" simulations producing only \"signs of possible performance\",<ref>[http://annex.ipacweb.org/library/conf/03/havighurst.pdf \"High Versus Low Fidelity Simulations: Does the Type of Format Affect Candidates' Performance or Perceptions?\"]</ref> but the distinction between high, moderate and low fidelity remains relative, depending on the context of a particular comparison.\n\nSimulations in education are somewhat like training simulations. They focus on specific tasks. The term 'microworld' is used to refer to educational simulations which model some abstract concept rather than simulating a realistic object or environment, or in some cases model a real world environment in a simplistic way so as to help a learner develop an understanding of the key concepts. Normally, a user can create some sort of construction within the microworld that will behave in a way consistent with the concepts being modeled. [[Seymour Papert]] was one of the first to advocate the value of microworlds, and the [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]] programming environment developed by Papert is one of the most famous microworlds. As another example, the [[Global Challenge Award]] online STEM learning web site uses microworld simulations to teach science concepts related to global warming and the future of energy. Other projects for simulations in educations are [[Open Source Physics]], [[NetSim]] etc.\n\n[[Project Management Simulation]] is increasingly used to train students and professionals in the art and science of project management. Using simulation for [[project management]] training improves learning retention and enhances the learning process.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Davidovitch, L.|author2=A. Parush|author3=A.

These may, for example, take the form of civics simulations, in which participants assume roles in a simulated society, or international relations simulations in which participants engage in negotiations, alliance formation, trade, diplomacy, and the use of force. Such simulations might be based on fictitious political systems, or be based on current or historical events. An example of the latter would be [[Barnard College]]'s ''Reacting to the Past'' series of historical educational games.<ref>[http://www.barnard.columbia.edu/reacting/ \"Reacting to the Past Home Page\"].</ref> The [[National Science Foundation]] has also supported the creation of [[reacting games]] that address science and math education.<ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/reactingscience/ \"Reacting to the Past: STEM Games\"].</ref>\n\nIn recent years, there has been increasing use of social simulations for staff training in aid and development agencies. The Carana simulation, for example, was first developed by the [[United Nations Development Programme]], and is now used in a very revised form by the [[World Bank]] for training staff to deal with fragile and conflict-affected countries.<ref>[http://paxsims.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/carana/ \"Carana,\" at 'PaxSims' blog, 27 January 2009].</ref>\n\n== Common user interaction systems for virtual simulations ==\nVirtual simulations represent a specific category of simulation that utilizes simulation equipment to create a simulated world for the user. Virtual simulations allow users to interact with a virtual world. Virtual worlds operate on platforms of integrated software and hardware components. In this manner, the system can accept input from the user (e.g., body tracking, voice/sound recognition, physical controllers) and produce output to the user (e.g., visual display, aural display, haptic display) .<ref name=\"SW&CA\">{{cite book |author=Sherman, W.R. |author2=Craig, A.B. |title=Understanding Virtual Reality |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |location=San Francisco, CA |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-55860-353-0 }}</ref> Virtual Simulations use the aforementioned modes of interaction to produce a sense of immersion for the user.\n\n===Virtual simulation input hardware===\n[[File:Simuladormotocicleta.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Motorcycle]] simulator of ''Bienal do Autom\u00f3vel'' exhibition, in [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Brazil]].]]\nThere is a wide variety of input hardware available to accept user input for virtual simulations. The following list briefly describes several of them:\n\n'''Body tracking''': The motion capture method is often used to record the user's movements and translate the captured data into inputs for the virtual simulation. For example, if a user physically turns their head, the motion would be captured by the simulation hardware in some way and translated to a corresponding shift in view within the simulation.\n* Capture suits and/or gloves may be used to capture movements of users body parts. The systems may have sensors incorporated inside them to sense movements of different body parts (e.g., fingers). Alternatively, these systems may have exterior tracking devices or marks that can be detected by external ultrasound, optical receivers or electromagnetic sensors. Internal inertial sensors are also available on some systems. The units may transmit data either wirelessly or through cables.\n* Eye trackers can also be used to detect eye movements so that the system can determine precisely where a user is looking at any given instant.\n'''Physical controllers''': Physical controllers provide input to the simulation only through direct manipulation by the user. In virtual simulations, tactile feedback from physical controllers is highly desirable in a number of simulation environments.\n* Omni directional treadmills can be used to capture the users locomotion as they walk or run.\n* High fidelity instrumentation such as instrument panels in virtual aircraft cockpits provides users with actual controls to raise the level of immersion. For example, pilots can use the actual global positioning system controls from the real device in a simulated cockpit to help them practice procedures with the actual device in the context of the integrated cockpit system.\n'''Voice/sound recognition''': This form of interaction may be used either to interact with agents within the simulation (e.g., virtual people) or to manipulate objects in the simulation (e.g., information). Voice interaction presumably increases the level of immersion for the user.\n* Users may use headsets with boom microphones, lapel microphones or the room may be equipped with strategically located microphones.\n\n====Current research into user input systems====\nResearch in future input systems hold a great deal of promise for virtual simulations. Systems such as [[brain\u2013computer interface]]s (BCIs) offer the ability to further increase the level of immersion for virtual simulation users. Lee, Keinrath, Scherer, Bischof, Pfurtscheller<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/TNSRE.2007.906956 |author=Leeb, R. |author2=Lee, F. |author3=Keinrath, C. |author4=Schere, R. |author5=Bischof, H. |author6=Pfurtscheller, G. |title=Brain-Computer Communication: Motivation, Aim, and Impact of Exploring a Virtual Apartment |journal=IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=473\u2013481 |year=2007 }}</ref> proved that na\u00efve subjects could be trained to use a BCI to navigate a virtual apartment with relative ease. Using the BCI, the authors found that subjects were able to freely navigate the virtual environment with relatively minimal effort. It is possible that these types of systems will become standard input modalities in future virtual simulation systems.\n\n===Virtual simulation output hardware===\nThere is a wide variety of output hardware available to deliver stimulus to users in virtual simulations. The following list briefly describes several of them:\n\n'''Visual display''': Visual displays provide the visual stimulus to the user.\n* Stationary displays can vary from a conventional desktop display to 360-degree wrap around screens to stereo three-dimensional screens. Conventional desktop displays can vary in size from 15 to 60+ inches. Wrap around screens are typically utilized in what is known as a [[cave automatic virtual environment]] (CAVE). Stereo three-dimensional screens produce three-dimensional images either with or without special glasses\u2014depending on the design.\n* [[Head-mounted display]]s (HMDs) have small displays that are mounted on headgear worn by the user. These systems are connected directly into the virtual simulation to provide the user with a more immersive experience. Weight, update rates and field of view are some of the key variables that differentiate HMDs. Naturally, heavier HMDs are undesirable as they cause fatigue over time. If the update rate is too slow, the system is unable to update the displays fast enough to correspond with a quick head turn by the user.  Slower update rates tend to cause simulation sickness and disrupt the sense of immersion. Field of view or the angular extent of the world that is seen at a given moment [[field of view]] can vary from system to system and has been found to affect the users sense of immersion.\n'''Aural display''': Several different types of audio systems exist to help the user hear and localize sounds spatially. Special software can be used to produce 3D audio effects [[3D audio]] to create the illusion that sound sources are placed within a defined three-dimensional space around the user.\n* Stationary conventional speaker systems may be used provide dual or multi-channel surround sound. However, external speakers are not as effective as headphones in producing 3D audio effects.<ref name=\"SW&CA\"/>\n* Conventional headphones offer a portable alternative to stationary speakers. They also have the added advantages of masking real world noise and facilitate more effective 3D audio sound effects.<ref name=\"SW&CA\"/>\n'''Haptic display''': These displays provide sense of touch to the user ([[haptic technology]]). This type of output is sometimes referred to as force feedback.\n* Tactile tile displays use different types of actuators such as inflatable bladders, vibrators, low frequency sub-woofers, pin actuators and/or thermo-actuators to produce sensations for the user.\n* End effector displays can respond to users inputs with resistance and force.<ref name=\"SW&CA\"/> These systems are often used in medical applications for remote surgeries that employ robotic instruments.<ref>Zahraee, A.H., Szewczyk, J., Paik, J.K., Guillaume, M. (2010). Robotic hand-held surgical device: evaluation of end-effector's kinematics and development of proof-of-concept prototypes. Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention, Beijing, China.</ref>\n'''Vestibular display''': These displays provide a sense of motion to the user ([[motion simulator]]). They often manifest as motion bases for virtual vehicle simulation such as driving simulators or flight simulators. Motion bases are fixed in place but use actuators to move the simulator in ways that can produce the sensations pitching, yawing or rolling. The simulators can also move in such a way as to produce a sense of acceleration on all axes (e.g., the motion base can produce the sensation of falling).\n\n== Clinical healthcare simulators ==\n{{Main|Medical simulation}}\nMedical simulators are increasingly being developed and deployed to teach therapeutic and diagnostic procedures as well as medical concepts and decision making to personnel in the health professions.  Simulators have been developed for training procedures ranging from the basics such as blood draw, to [[laparoscopic]] surgery<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ahmed K, Keeling AN, Fakhry M, Ashrafian H, Aggarwal R, Naughton PA, Darzi A, Cheshire N, etal |title=Role of Virtual Reality Simulation in Teaching and Assessing Technical Skills in Endovascular Intervention |journal=J Vasc Interv Radiol |volume=21 |date=January 2010 }}</ref> and trauma care.

Medical simulations of this sort will often use 3D [[Computed tomography|CT]] or [[MRI]] scans of patient data to enhance realism. Some medical simulations are developed to be widely distributed (such as web-enabled simulations<ref>{{cite web | url=http://vam.anest.ufl.edu/simulations/simulationportfolio.php | title=Simulation Portfolio | work=Virtual Anesthesia Machine | accessdate=May 15, 2016}}</ref> and procedural simulations<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1445-2197.2010.05349.x/abstract | title=A randomized trial evaluating a cognitive simulator for laparoscopic appendectomy | vauthors=Loveday BP, Oosthuizen GV, Diener BS, Windsor JA | journal=ANZ Journal of Surgery | year=2010 | volume=80 | issue=9 | pages=588\u2013594 | doi=10.1111/j.1445-2197.2010.05349.x | pmid=20840399}}</ref> that can be viewed via standard web browsers) and can be interacted with using standard computer interfaces, such as the [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[computer mouse|mouse]].\n\nAnother important medical application of a simulator\u2014although, perhaps, denoting a slightly different meaning of ''simulator''\u2014is the use of a [[placebo]] drug, a formulation that simulates the active drug in trials of drug efficacy (see [[Placebo (origins of technical term)]]).\n\n=== Improving patient safety ===\nPatient safety is a concern in the medical industry.  Patients have been known to suffer injuries and even death due to management error, and lack of using best standards of care and training. According to Building a National Agenda for Simulation-Based Medical Education (Eder-Van Hook, Jackie, 2004), \"A health care provider's ability to react prudently in an unexpected situation is one of the most critical factors in creating a positive outcome in medical emergency, regardless of whether it occurs on the battlefield, freeway, or hospital emergency room.\" simulation.  Eder-Van Hook (2004) also noted that medical errors kill up to 98,000 with an estimated cost between $37 and $50 million and $17 to $29 billion for preventable adverse events dollars per year.  \"Deaths due to preventable adverse events exceed deaths attributable to motor vehicle accidents, breast cancer, or AIDS\" Eder-Van Hook (2004).\n\nInnovative simulation training solutions are now being used to train medical professionals in an attempt to reduce the number of safety concerns that have adverse effects on the patients.  However, according to the article \"Does Simulation Improve Patient Safety? Self-efficacy, Competence, Operational Performance, and Patient Safety\" (Nishisaki A., Keren R., and Nadkarni, V., 2007), the jury is still out.  Nishisaki states that \"There is good evidence that simulation training improves provider and team self-efficacy and competence on manikins. There is also good evidence that procedural simulation improves actual operational performance in clinical settings.\"<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nishisaki A, Keren R, Nadkarni V |title=Does simulation improve patient safety? Self-efficacy, competence, operational performance, and patient safety |journal=Anesthesiol Clin |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=225\u201336 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17574187 |doi=10.1016/j.anclin.2007.03.009 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1932-2275(07)00025-0}}</ref> However, no evidence yet shows that crew resource management training through simulation, despite its promise, improves team operational performance at the bedside. Although evidence that simulation-based training actually improves patient outcome has been slow to accrue, today the ability of simulation to provide hands-on experience that translates to the operating room is no longer in doubt.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Zendejas B |author2=Brydges R |author3=Hamstra SJ |display-authors=etal |title=State of the evidence on simulation-based training for laparoscopic surgery: A systematic review |journal=Ann Aurg |volume=257 |pages=586\u201393 |date=2013|doi=10.1097/SLA.0b013e318288c40b|pmid=23407298}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pandey VA, ((Wolfe JHN)) |title=Expanding the use of simulation in open vascular surgical training |journal=J Vasc Surg |volume=56 |pages=847\u201352 |date=2012|pmid=22836105|doi=10.1016/j.jvs.2012.04.015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Palter VN, Grantcharov TP |title=Individualized deliberate practice on a virtual reality simulator improves technical performance of surgical novices in the operating room |journal=Ann Surg |volume=259 |pages=443\u201348 |date=2014 |doi=10.1097/sla.0000000000000254}}</ref>)\n\nOne such attempt to improve patient safety through the use of simulations training is pediatric care to deliver just-in-time service or/and just-in-place.  This training consists of 20&nbsp;minutes of simulated training just before workers report to shift.  It is hoped that the recentness of the training will increase the positive and reduce the negative results that have generally been associated with the procedure.  The purpose of this study is to determine if just-in-time training improves patient safety and operational performance of orotracheal intubation and decrease occurrences of undesired associated events and \"to test the hypothesis that high fidelity simulation may enhance the training efficacy and patient safety in simulation settings.\"  The conclusion as reported in \"Abstract P38: Just-In-Time Simulation Training Improves ICU Physician Trainee Airway Resuscitation Participation without Compromising Procedural Success or Safety\" (Nishisaki A., 2008), were that simulation training improved resident participation in real cases; but did not sacrifice the quality of service. It could be therefore hypothesized that by increasing the number of highly trained residents through the use of simulation training, that the simulation training does in fact increase patient safety.  This hypothesis would have to be researched for validation and the results may or may not generalize to other situations.\n\n===History of simulation in healthcare===\nThe first medical simulators were simple models of human patients.<ref name=\"medicalSimulationHistory\">{{cite journal |author=Meller, G. |title=A Typology of Simulators for Medical Education |journal=Journal of Digital Imaging |year=1997 |url=http://www.medsim.com/profile/article1.html}}</ref>\n\nSince antiquity, these representations in clay and stone were used to demonstrate clinical features of disease states and their effects on humans. Models have been found from many cultures and continents. These models have been used in some cultures (e.g., Chinese culture) as a \"[[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]]\" instrument, allowing women to consult male physicians while maintaining social laws of modesty. Models are used today to help students learn the [[anatomy]] of the [[musculoskeletal]] system and organ systems.<ref name=\"medicalSimulationHistory\" />\n\nIn 2002, the [[Society for Simulation in Healthcare]] (SSH) was formed to become a leader in international interprofessional advances the application of medical simulation in healthcare<ref name=Riley2008>{{cite book|author=Richard H.

Although modern simulation is thought to have its roots in training and the military, in the 20th century it also became a conduit for enterprises which were more hedonistic in nature.\n\n=== History of visual simulation in film and games ===\n\n==== Early history (1940s and 1950s) ====\nThe first simulation game may have been created as early as 1947 by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann. This was a straightforward game that simulated a missile being fired at a target.  The curve of the missile and its speed could be adjusted using several knobs.  In 1958, a computer game called \"''[[Tennis for Two]]''\" was created by Willy Higginbotham which simulated a tennis game between two players who could both play at the same time using hand controls and was displayed on an oscilloscope.<ref>[http://www.pong-story.com/intro.htm Welcome to PONG-Story] {{webarchive |url=http://www.webcitation.org/5seElSgBC?url=http://www.pong-story.com/intro.htm |date=September 10, 2010 }}</ref>  This was one of the first electronic video games to use a graphical display.\n\n==== 1970s and early 1980s ====\n[[Computer-generated imagery]] was used in film to simulate objects as early as 1972 in the [[A Computer Animated Hand]], parts of which were shown on the big screen in the 1976 film [[Futureworld]]. Many will remember the ''\"targeting computer\"'' that young Skywalker turns off in the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''.\n\nThe film ''[[Tron]]'' (1982) was the first film to use computer-generated imagery for more than a couple of minutes.<ref>[http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/tron.html TRON - The 1982 Movie<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAdvances in technology in the 1980s caused 3D simulation to become more widely used and it began to appear in movies and in computer-based games such as Atari's ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]'' (1980) and [[Acornsoft]]'s ''[[Elite (video game)|Elite]]'' (1984), one of the first [[Wire-frame model|wire-frame 3D graphics game]]s for [[home computer]]s.\n\n==== Pre-virtual cinematography era (early 1980s to 1990s) ====\nAdvances in technology in the 1980s made the computer more affordable and more capable than they were in previous decades,<ref>[http://homepages.vvm.com/~jhunt/compupedia/History%20of%20Computers/history_of_computers_1980.htm History of Computers 1980]</ref> which facilitated the rise of computer such as the Xbox gaming.

Today, computer simulation games such as ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' are played by millions of people around the world.\n\nIn 1993, the film ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' became the first popular film to use computer-generated graphics extensively, integrating the simulated dinosaurs almost seamlessly into live action scenes.\n\nThis event transformed the film industry; in 1995, the film ''[[Toy Story]]'' was the first film to use only computer-generated images and by the new millennium computer generated graphics were the leading choice for special effects in films.<ref>{{cite web|date=August 16, 2002|url=http://www.beanblossom.in.us/larryy/cgi.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717074134/http://www.beanblossom.in.us/larryy/cgi.html|archivedate=July 17, 2012|deadurl=yes|title=A Brief, Early History of Computer Graphics in Film}}</ref>\n\n==== Virtual cinematography (early 2000s\u2013present) ====\nThe advent of [[virtual cinematography]] in the early [[2000s (decade)]] has led to an explosion of movies that would have been impossible to shoot without it. Classic examples are the [[Virtual actor|digital look-alikes]] of Neo, Smith and other characters in the [[The Matrix (franchise)|Matrix sequels]] and the extensive use of physically impossible camera runs in the [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)]] trilogy.\n\nThe terminal in the [[Pan Am (TV series)]] no longer existed during the filming of this 2011-2012 aired series, which was no problem as they created it in virtual cinematography utilising [[automation|automated]] [[camera angle|viewpoint]] finding and matching in conjunction with compositing real and simulated footage, which has been the bread and butter of the [[film|movie]] [[artist]] in and around [[film studio]]s since the early 2000s.\n\n[[Computer-generated imagery]] is \"the application of the field of 3D computer graphics to special effects\".  This technology is used for visual effects because they are high in quality, controllable, and can create effects that would not be feasible using any other technology either because of cost, resources or safety.<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/c/computer-generated_imagery.htm Computer-generated imagery<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Computer-generated graphics can be seen in many live action movies today, especially those of the action genre.  Further, computer generated imagery has almost completely supplanted hand-drawn animation in children's movies which are increasingly computer-generated only. Examples of movies that use computer-generated imagery include ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' and ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]''.\n\n=== Examples of non-film entertainment simulation ===\n\n==== Simulation games ====\n[[Simulation games]], as opposed to other genres of video and computer games, represent or simulate an environment accurately.  Moreover, they represent the interactions between the playable characters and the environment realistically.  These kinds of games are usually more complex in terms of game play.<ref>[http://open-site.org/Games/Video_Games/Simulation Simulation - General Information | Open-Site.org<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Simulation games have become incredibly popular among people of all ages.<ref>[http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/retail.aspx?indid=2003&chid=1 Video Games in the US Market Research | IBISWorld<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Popular simulation games include ''[[SimCity]]'' and ''[[Tiger Woods PGA Tour]]''. There are also [[flight simulator]] and [[driving simulator]] games.\n\n==== Theme park rides ====\n\nSimulators have been used for entertainment since the [[Link Trainer]] in the 1930s.<ref>[http://www.starksravings.com/linktrainer/linktrainer.htm Link Trainer Restoration<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The first modern simulator ride to open at a theme park was Disney's [[Star Tours]] in 1987 soon followed by Universal's [[The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera]] in 1990 which was the first ride to be done entirely with computer graphics.<ref name=\"trudang.com\">http://www.trudang.com/simulatr/simulatr.html{{dead link|date=May 2016}}</ref>\n\nSimulator rides are the progeny of military training simulators and commercial simulators, but they are different in a fundamental way.  While military training simulators react realistically to the input of the trainee in real time, ride simulators only feel like they move realistically and move according to prerecorded motion scripts.<ref name=\"trudang.com\"/> One of the first simulator rides, Star Tours, which cost $32 millon, used a hydraulic motion based cabin.  The movement was programmed by a joystick.  Today's simulator rides, such as [[The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man]] include elements to increase the amount of immersion experienced by the riders such as: 3D imagery, physical effects (spraying water or producing scents), and movement through an environment.<ref>[http://www.awn.com/mag/issue4.02/4.02pages/kenyonspiderman.php3 Bringing Spidey to Life: Kleiser-Walczak Construction Company<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Examples of simulation rides include\n[[Mission Space]] and [[The Simpsons Ride]]. There are many simulation rides at themeparks like Disney, Universal etc., Examples are [[Flint Stones]], [[Earth Quake]], Time Machine, [[King Kong]].\n\n==Simulation and manufacturing==\nManufacturing represents one of the most important applications of simulation.  This technique represents a valuable tool used by engineers when evaluating the effect of capital investment in equipment and physical facilities like factory plants, warehouses, and distribution centers. Simulation can be used to predict the performance of an existing or planned system and to compare alternative solutions for a particular design problem.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00170-008-1686-z |author=Benedettini, O. |author2=Tjahjono, B. |title=Towards an improved tool to facilitate simulation modeling of complex manufacturing systems |journal=International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology |volume=43 |issue=1/2 |pages=191\u20139 |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\nAnother important goal of [[Simulation in Manufacturing Systems]] is to quantify system performance. Common measures of system performance include the following:<ref>{{cite book |author=Banks, J. |author2=Carson J. |author3=Nelson B.L. |author4=Nicol, D. |title=Discrete-event system simulation |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |year=2005 |edition=4th |isbn=978-0-13-088702-3 }}</ref>\n* Throughput under average and peak loads;\n* System cycle time (how long it take to produce one part);\n* Utilization of resource, labor, and machines;\n* Bottlenecks and choke points;\n* Queuing at work locations;\n* Queuing and delays caused by material-handling devices and systems;\n* WIP storages needs;\n* Staffing requirements;\n* Effectiveness of scheduling systems;\n* Effectiveness of control systems.\n\n==More examples of simulation==\n\n===Automobiles===\n[[File:Car racing simulator - SBR Racing, Construma, 2015.04.17.JPG|thumb|Car racing simulator]]\n[[File:Vehicle simulator.jpg|thumb|right|A soldier tests out a heavy-wheeled-vehicle driver simulator.]]\n\nAn automobile simulator provides an opportunity to reproduce the characteristics of real vehicles in a virtual environment. It replicates the external factors and conditions with which a vehicle interacts enabling a driver to feel as if they are sitting in the cab of their own vehicle. Scenarios and events are replicated with sufficient reality to ensure that drivers become fully immersed in the experience rather than simply viewing it as an educational experience.\n\nThe simulator provides a constructive experience for the novice driver and enables more complex exercises to be undertaken by the more mature driver. For novice drivers, truck simulators provide an opportunity to begin their career by applying best practice. For mature drivers, simulation provides the ability to enhance good driving or to detect poor practice and to suggest the necessary steps for remedial action. For companies, it provides an opportunity to educate staff in the driving skills that achieve reduced maintenance costs, improved productivity and, most importantly, to ensure the safety of their actions in all possible situations.\n\n===Biomechanics===\n{{Main|ArtiSynth|simtk-opensim|AnimatLab (software)}}\nAn open-source simulation platform for creating dynamic mechanical models built from combinations of rigid and deformable bodies, joints, constraints, and various force actuators.  It is specialized for creating biomechanical models of human anatomical structures, with the intention to study their function and eventually assist in the design and planning of medical treatment.\n\nA biomechanics simulator is used to analyze walking dynamics, study sports performance, simulate surgical procedures, analyze joint loads, design medical devices, and animate human and animal movement.\n\nA neuromechanical simulator that combines biomechanical and biologically realistic neural network simulation. It allows the user to test hypotheses on the neural basis of behavior in a physically accurate 3-D virtual environment.\n\n===City and urban===\nA city simulator can be a [[city-building game]] but can also be a tool used by urban planners to understand how cities are likely to evolve in response to various policy decisions. [[AnyLogic]] is an example of modern, large-scale urban simulators designed for use by urban planners. City simulators are generally [[Agent (economics)|agent]]-based simulations with explicit representations for [[land use]] and [[transportation]]. [[UrbanSim]] and [[Land Use Evolution and Impact Assessment Model|LEAM]] are examples of large-scale urban simulation models that are used by metropolitan planning agencies and military bases for land use and [[transportation planning]].\n\n{{further|traffic simulation}}\n\n===Classroom of the future===\nThe \"classroom of the future\" will probably contain several kinds of simulators, in addition to textual and visual learning tools. This will allow students to enter the clinical years better prepared, and with a higher skill level. The advanced student or postgraduate will have a more concise and comprehensive method of retraining\u2014or of incorporating new clinical procedures into their skill set\u2014and regulatory bodies and medical institutions will find it easier to assess the proficiency and [[Competence (human resources)|competency]] of individuals.\n\nThe classroom of the future will also form the basis of a clinical skills unit for continuing education of medical personnel; and in the same way that the use of periodic flight training assists airline pilots, this technology will assist practitioners throughout their career.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\nThe simulator will be more than a \"living\" textbook, it will become an integral a part of the practice of medicine.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} The simulator environment will also provide a standard platform for curriculum development in institutions of medical education.\n\n===Communication satellites===\nModern satellite communications systems ([[SatCom]]) are often large and complex with many interacting parts and elements. In addition, the need for broadband connectivity on a moving vehicle has increased dramatically in the past few years for both commercial and military applications. To accurately predict and deliver high quality of service, satcom system designers have to factor in terrain as well as atmospheric and meteorological conditions in their planning. To deal with such complexity, system designers and operators increasingly turn towards computer models of their systems to simulate real world operational conditions and gain insights into usability and requirements prior to final product sign-off. Modeling improves the understanding of the system by enabling the SatCom system designer or planner to simulate real world performance by injecting the models with multiple hypothetical atmospheric and environmental conditions. Simulation is often used in the training of civilian and military personnel. This usually occurs when it is prohibitively expensive or simply too dangerous to allow trainees to use the real equipment in the real world. In such situations they will spend time learning valuable lessons in a \"safe\" virtual environment yet living a lifelike experience (or at least it is the goal). Often the convenience is to permit mistakes during training for a safety-critical system.\n\n===Digital Lifecycle===\n[[File:ugs-nx-5-engine-airflow-simulation.jpg|thumb|right|UGS | Simulation of airflow over an engine]]\n\nSimulation solutions are being increasingly integrated with CAx (CAD, CAM, CAE....) solutions and processes. The use of simulation throughout the product lifecycle, especially at the earlier concept and design stages, has the potential of providing substantial benefits. These benefits range from direct cost issues such as reduced prototyping and shorter time-to-market, to better performing products and higher margins. However, for some companies, simulation has not provided the expected benefits.\n\nThe research firm Aberdeen Group has found that nearly all best-in-class manufacturers use simulation early in the design process as compared to 3 or 4 laggards who do not.\n\nThe successful use of simulation, early in the lifecycle, has been largely driven by increased integration of simulation tools with the entire CAD, CAM and PLM solution-set. Simulation solutions can now function across the extended enterprise in a [[NX 5#MultiCAD .2F MultiDiscipline Models|multi-CAD environment]], and include solutions for [[Teamcenter#Simulation Process Management|managing simulation data and processes]] and ensuring that simulation results are made part of the product lifecycle history. The ability to use simulation across the entire lifecycle has been enhanced through improved user interfaces such as [[NX 5#Tailorable UI|tailorable user interfaces]] and \"wizards\" which allow all appropriate PLM participants to take part in the simulation process.\n\n===Disaster preparedness===\nSimulation training has become a method for preparing people for disasters.  Simulations can replicate emergency situations and track how learners respond thanks to a [[lifelike experience]]. Disaster preparedness simulations can involve training on how to handle [[terrorism]] attacks, natural disasters, [[pandemic]] outbreaks, or other life-threatening emergencies.\n\nOne organization that has used simulation training for disaster preparedness is CADE (Center for Advancement of Distance Education).  CADE<ref>CADE- http://www.uic.edu/sph/cade/</ref> has used a video game to prepare emergency workers for multiple types of attacks.  As reported by News-Medical.Net, \"The video game is the first in a series of simulations to address bioterrorism, pandemic flu, smallpox and other disasters that emergency personnel must prepare for.<ref>News-Medical.Net article- http://www.news-medical.net/news/2005/10/27/14106.aspx</ref>\"  Developed by a team from the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] (UIC), the game allows learners to practice their emergency skills in a safe, controlled environment.\n\nThe Emergency Simulation Program (ESP) at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT), Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada is another example of an organization that uses simulation to train for emergency situations.  ESP uses simulation to train on the following situations: forest fire fighting, oil or chemical spill response, earthquake response, law enforcement, municipal fire fighting, hazardous material handling, military training, and response to terrorist attack <ref name=\"straylightmm.com\">[http://www.straylightmm.com/ Emergency Response Training<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  One feature of the simulation system is the implementation of \"Dynamic Run-Time Clock,\" which allows simulations to run a 'simulated' time frame, \"'speeding up' or 'slowing down' time as desired\"<ref name=\"straylightmm.com\"/>  Additionally, the system allows session recordings, picture-icon based navigation, file storage of individual simulations, multimedia components, and launch external applications.\n\nAt the University of Qu\u00e9bec in Chicoutimi, a research team at the outdoor research and expertise laboratory (Laboratoire d'Expertise et de Recherche en Plein Air \u2013 LERPA) specializes in using wilderness backcountry accident simulations to verify emergency response coordination.\n\nInstructionally, the benefits of emergency training through simulations are that learner performance can be tracked through the system.  This allows the developer to make adjustments as necessary or alert the educator on topics that may require additional attention.  Other advantages are that the learner can be guided or trained on how to respond appropriately before continuing to the next emergency segment\u2014this is an aspect that may not be available in the live-environment.  Some emergency training simulators also allows for immediate feedback, while other simulations may provide a summary and instruct the learner to engage in the learning topic again.\n\nIn a live-emergency situation, emergency responders do not have time to waste. Simulation-training in this environment provides an opportunity for learners to gather as much information as they can and practice their knowledge in a safe environment.  They can make mistakes without risk of endangering lives and be given the opportunity to correct their errors to prepare for the real-life emergency.\n\n===Economics===\nIn [[economics]] and especially [[macroeconomics]], the effects of proposed policy actions, such as [[fiscal policy]] changes or [[monetary policy]] changes, are simulated to judge their desirability. A mathematical model of the economy, having been fitted to historical economic data, is used as a proxy for the actual economy; proposed values of [[government spending]], [[taxation]], [[open market operations]], etc. are used as inputs to the simulation of the model, and various variables of interest such as the [[inflation rate]], the [[unemployment rate]], the [[balance of trade]] deficit, the government [[budget deficit]], etc. are the outputs of the simulation. The simulated values of these variables of interest are compared for different proposed policy inputs to determine which set of outcomes is most desirable.\n\n===Engineering, technology, and processes===\n<!--If the above heading is changed, update #links in other articles that point to it.-->Simulation is an important feature in engineering systems or any system that involves many processes.  For example, in [[electrical engineering]], delay lines may be used to simulate [[propagation delay]] and [[Phase (waves)#Phase shift|phase shift]] caused by an actual [[transmission line]].  Similarly, [[dummy load]]s may be used to simulate [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] without simulating propagation, and is used in situations where propagation is unwanted.  A simulator may imitate only a few of the operations and functions of the unit it simulates. ''Contrast with'': [[emulator|emulate]].<ref name=\"FS1037C\">[[Federal Standard 1037C]]</ref>\n\nMost engineering simulations entail mathematical modeling and computer assisted investigation. There are many cases, however, where mathematical modeling is not reliable.  Simulation of fluid dynamics problems often require both mathematical and physical simulations.  In these cases the physical models require [[similitude (model)|dynamic similitude]]. Physical and chemical simulations have also direct realistic uses, rather than research uses; in [[chemical engineering]], for example, [[process simulation]]s are used to give the process parameters immediately used for operating chemical plants, such as oil refineries. Simulators are also used for plant operator training. It is called Operator Training Simulator (OTS) and has been widely adopted by many industries from chemical to oil&gas and to power industry. This created a safe and realistic virtual environment to train board operators and engineers. [[MiMiC Simulation Software|Mimic]] is capable of providing high fidelity dynamic models of nearly all chemical plants for operator training and control system testing.\n\n===Equipment===\nDue to the dangerous and expensive nature of training on heavy equipment, simulation has become a common solution across many industries. Types of simulated equipment include cranes, mining reclaimers and construction equipment, among many others. Often the simulation units will include pre-built scenarios by which to teach trainees, as well as the ability to customize new scenarios. Such equipment simulators are intended to create a safe and cost effective alternative to training on live equipment.<ref>[http://www.cm-labs.com/crane-simulators Crane Simulators | CM Labs Simulations]</ref>\n\n===Ergonomics===\nErgonomic simulation involves the analysis of virtual products or manual tasks within a virtual environment. In the engineering process, the aim of ergonomics is to develop and to improve the design of products and work environments.<ref name=\"Reed, M. P. 2006\">Reed, M. P., Faraway, J., Chaffin, D.

P. 2006\"/> Several ergonomic simulation tools have been developed including Jack, SAFEWORK, RAMSIS, and SAMMIE.\n\nThe software tools typically calculate biomechanical properties including individual muscle forces, joint forces and moments. Most of these tools employ standard ergonomic evaluation methods such as the NIOSH lifting equation and Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA). Some simulations also analyze physiological measures including metabolism, energy expenditure, and fatigue limits Cycle time studies, design and process validation, user comfort, reachability, and line of sight are other human-factors that may be examined in ergonomic simulation packages.<ref>[http://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/products/tecnomatix/assembly_planning/jack/index.shtml Jack and Process Simulate Human: Siemens PLM Software<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nModeling and simulation of a task can be performed by manually manipulating the virtual human in the simulated environment. Some ergonomics simulation software permits interactive, real-time simulation and evaluation through actual human input via motion capture technologies. However, motion capture for ergonomics requires expensive equipment and the creation of props to represent the environment or product.\n\nSome applications of ergonomic simulation in include analysis of solid waste collection, disaster management tasks, interactive gaming,<ref>Bush, P.

[[Risk]]-adjusted [[net present value]], for example, is computed from well-defined but not always known (or fixed) inputs. By imitating the performance of the project under evaluation, simulation can provide a distribution of NPV over a range of [[discounts and allowances|discount rates]] and other variables.\n\nSimulations are frequently used in financial training to engage participants in experiencing various historical as well as fictional situations. There are stock market simulations, portfolio simulations, risk management simulations or models and forex simulations. Such simulations are typically based on [[stochastic asset model]]s.  Using these simulations in a training program allows for the application of theory into a something akin to real life.  As with other industries, the use of simulations can be technology or case-study driven.\n\n===Flight===\n{{Main|Flight simulation}}\n\n[[Flight Simulation|Flight Simulation Training Devices]] (FSTD) are used to train [[Aviator|pilots]] on the ground.  In comparison to training in an actual [[aircraft]], simulation based training allows for the training of maneuvers or situations that may be impractical (or even dangerous) to perform in the aircraft, while keeping the pilot and instructor in a relatively low-risk environment on the ground.  For example, electrical system failures, instrument failures, hydraulic system failures, and even flight control failures can be simulated without risk to the pilots or an aircraft.\n\nInstructors can also provide students with a higher concentration of training tasks in a given period of time than is usually possible in the aircraft.  For example, conducting multiple [[instrument approach]]es in the actual aircraft may require significant time spent repositioning the aircraft, while in a simulation, as soon as one approach has been completed, the instructor can immediately preposition the simulated aircraft to an ideal (or less than ideal) location from which to begin the next approach.\n\nFlight simulation also provides an economic advantage over training in an actual aircraft.  Once fuel, maintenance, and insurance costs are taken into account, the operating costs of an FSTD are usually substantially lower than the operating costs of the simulated aircraft.  For some large transport category airplanes, the operating costs may be several times lower for the FSTD than the actual aircraft.\n\nSome people who use simulator software, especially flight simulator [[software]], build their own simulator at home. Some people\u2014to further the realism of their homemade simulator\u2014buy used cards and racks that run the same software used by the original machine.  While this involves solving the problem of matching hardware and software\u2014and the problem that hundreds of cards plug into many different racks\u2014many still find that solving these problems is well worthwhile. Some are so serious about realistic simulation that they will buy real aircraft parts, like complete nose sections of written-off [[aircraft]], at [[aircraft boneyard]]s. This permits people to simulate a hobby that they are unable to pursue in real life.\n\n===Marine===\nBearing resemblance to flight simulators, marine simulators train ships' personnel.  The most common marine simulators include:\n\n* Ship's bridge simulators\n* Engine room simulators\n* Cargo handling simulators\n* Communication / [[GMDSS]] simulators\n* ROV simulators\n\nSimulators like these are mostly used within maritime colleges, training institutions and navies. They often consist of a replication of a ships' bridge, with operating console(s), and a number of screens on which the virtual surroundings are projected.\n\n===Military===\n{{Main|Military simulation}}\n[[Military]] simulations, also known informally as war games, are models in which theories of warfare can be tested and refined without the need for actual hostilities. They exist in many different forms, with varying degrees of realism. In recent times, their scope has widened to include not only military but also political and social factors (for example, the [[Nationlab|NationLab]] series of strategic exercises in Latin America).<ref>[[The Economist]] provides a current (as of 2012) survey of public projects attempting to simulate some theories in [http://www.economist.com/node/21553006 \"The science of civil war: What makes heroic strife\"].</ref> While many governments make use of simulation, both individually and collaboratively, little is known about the model's specifics outside professional circles.\n\n===Payment and securities settlement system===\nSimulation techniques have also been applied to payment and securities settlement systems.  Among the main users are central banks who are generally responsible for the oversight of market infrastructure and entitled to contribute to the smooth functioning of the payment systems.\n\nCentral banks have been using payment system simulations to evaluate things such as the adequacy or sufficiency of liquidity available ( in the form of account balances and intraday credit limits) to participants (mainly banks) to allow efficient settlement of payments.<ref>Leinonen (ed.): Simulation studies of liquidity needs, risks and efficiency in payment networks (Bank of Finland Studies E:39/2007) [http://pss.bof.fi/Pages/Publications.aspx Simulation publications]</ref><ref>Neville Arjani: Examining the Trade-Off between Settlement Delay and Intraday Liquidity in Canada's LVTS: A Simulation Approach (Working Paper 2006-20, Bank of Canada) [http://pss.bof.fi/Pages/Publications.aspx Simulation publications]</ref> The need for liquidity is also dependent on the availability and the type of netting procedures in the systems, thus some of the studies have a focus on system comparisons.<ref>Johnson, K.; McAndrews, J.; Soram\u00e4ki, K. 'Economizing on Liquidity with Deferred Settlement Mechanisms' (Reserve Bank of New York Economic Policy Review, December 2004)</ref>\n\nAnother application is to evaluate risks related to events such as communication network breakdowns or the inability of participants to send payments (e.g. in case of possible bank failure).<ref>H. Leinonen (ed.): Simulation analyses and stress testing of payment networks (Bank of Finland Studies E:42/2009) [http://pss.bof.fi/Pages/Publications.aspx Simulation publications]</ref> This kind of analysis falls under the concepts of [[stress testing]] or [[scenario analysis]].\n\nA common way to conduct these simulations is to replicate the settlement logics of the real payment or securities settlement systems under analysis and then use real observed payment data. In case of system comparison or system development, naturally also the other settlement logics need to be implemented.\n\nTo perform stress testing and scenario analysis, the observed data needs to be altered, e.g. some payments delayed or removed. To analyze the levels of liquidity, initial liquidity levels are varied. System comparisons (benchmarking) or evaluations of new netting algorithms or rules are performed by running simulations with a fixed set of data and varying only the system setups.\n\nInference is usually done by comparing the benchmark simulation results to the results of altered simulation setups by comparing indicators such as unsettled transactions or settlement delays.\n\n===Project management===\n{{Main|Project management simulation}}\nProject management simulation is simulation used for project management training and analysis. It is often used as training simulation for project managers. In other cases it is used for what-if analysis and for supporting decision-making in real projects. Frequently the simulation is conducted using software tools.\n\n===Robotics===\n{{Main|Robotics simulator}}\nA robotics simulator is used to create embedded applications for a specific (or not) robot without being dependent on the 'real' robot. In some cases, these applications can be transferred to the real robot (or rebuilt) without modifications. Robotics simulators allow reproducing situations that cannot be 'created' in the real world because of cost, time, or the 'uniqueness' of a resource. A simulator also allows fast robot prototyping. Many robot simulators feature [[physics engine]]s to simulate a robot's dynamics.\n\n===Production===\nSimulations of production systems is used mainly to examine the effect of improvements or investments in a production system. Most often this is done using a static spreadsheet with process times and transportation times. For more sophisticated simulations [[Discrete Event Simulation]] (DES) is used with the advantages to simulate dynamics in the production system. A production system is very much dynamic depending on variations in manufacturing processes, assembly times, machine set-ups, breaks, breakdowns and small stoppages.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ulf|first=Eriksson|title=Diffusion of Discrete Event Simulation in Swedish Industry|year=2005|publisher=Doktorsavhandlingar vid Chalmers tekniska h\u00f6gskola|location=Gothenburg|isbn=91-7291-577-3}}</ref>  There are lots of [[List of discrete event simulation software|software]] commonly used for discrete event simulation. They differ in usability and markets but do often share the same foundation.\n\n===Sales process===\n{{Main|Sales process engineering}}\nSimulations are useful in modeling the flow of transactions through business processes, such as in the field of [[sales process engineering]], to study and improve the flow of customer orders through various stages of completion (say, from an initial proposal for providing goods/services through order acceptance and installation).  Such simulations can help predict the impact of how improvements in methods might impact variability, cost, labor time, and the quantity of transactions at various stages in the process.  A full-featured computerized process simulator can be used to depict such models, as can simpler educational demonstrations using spreadsheet software, pennies being transferred between cups based on the roll of a die, or dipping into a tub of colored beads with a scoop.<ref name=\"Selden 1997\">{{cite book|title='''Sales Process Engineering: A Personal Workshop''' |author = Paul H. Selden|publisher=ASQ Quality Press|location = Milwaukee, WI|year=1997|isbn=978-0-87389-418-0}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\nIn sports, [[computer simulations]] are often done to predict the outcome of events and the performance of individual sportspeople.  They attempt to recreate the event through models built from [[statistics]]. The increase in technology has allowed anyone with knowledge of programming the ability to run simulations of their models.  The simulations are built from a series of mathematical [[algorithms]], or models, and can vary with accuracy. Accuscore, which is licensed by companies such as [[ESPN]], is a well known simulation program for all major [[sports]]. It offers detailed analysis of games through simulated betting lines, projected point totals and overall probabilities.\n \nWith the increased interest in [[fantasy sports]] simulation models that predict individual player performance have gained popularity.  Companies like What If Sports and StatFox specialize in not only using their simulations for predicting game results, but how well individual players will do as well.  Many people use models to determine who to start in their fantasy leagues.\n\nAnother way simulations are helping the sports field is in the use of [[biomechanics]]. Models are derived and simulations are run from data received from sensors attached to athletes and video equipment. [[Sports biomechanics]] aided by simulation models answer questions regarding training techniques such as: the effect of fatigue on throwing performance (height of throw) and biomechanical factors of the upper limbs (reactive strength index; hand contact time).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/TNSRE10.1080/14763141.2011.592544 |author=Harrison, Andrew J |title=Throwing and catching movements exhibit post-activation potentiation effects following fatigue |journal=Sports Biomechanics |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=185\u2013196 |year=2011 }}</ref>\n\nComputer simulations allow their users to take models which before were too complex to run, and give them answers. Simulations have proven to be some of the best insights into both play performance and team predictability.\n\n===Space shuttle countdown===\n[[File:KSCFiringroom1.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Firing Room 1 configured for [[space shuttle]] launches]]\nSimulation is used at [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) to train and certify [[Space Shuttle]] engineers during simulated launch countdown operations.  The Space Shuttle engineering community participates in a launch countdown integrated simulation before each shuttle flight.  This simulation is a virtual simulation where real people interact with simulated Space Shuttle vehicle and Ground Support Equipment (GSE) hardware.  The Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation, also known as S0044, involves countdown processes that integrate many of the Space Shuttle vehicle and GSE systems.  Some of the Shuttle systems integrated in the simulation are the main propulsion system, [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|main engines]], [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters]], ground liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, [[external tank]], flight controls, navigation, and avionics.<ref>Sikora, E.A. (2010, July 27). Space Shuttle Main Propulsion System expert, John F. Kennedy Space Center. Interview.</ref>  The high-level objectives of the Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation are:\n* To demonstrate [[Firing room#Firing room|Firing Room]] final countdown phase operations.\n* To provide training for system engineers in recognizing, reporting and evaluating system problems in a time critical environment.\n* To exercise the launch team's ability to evaluate, prioritize and respond to problems in an integrated manner within a time critical environment.\n* To provide procedures to be used in performing failure/recovery testing of the operations performed in the final countdown phase.<ref>Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation.  National Aeronautics and Space Administration KSC Document # RTOMI  S0044, Revision AF05, 2009.</ref>\n\nThe Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation takes place at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] [[Launch Control Center]] [[Firing room#Firing room|Firing Rooms]].  The firing room used during the simulation is the same control room where real launch countdown operations are executed.  As a result, equipment used for real launch countdown operations is engaged.  Command and control computers, application software, engineering plotting and trending tools, launch countdown procedure documents, launch commit criteria documents, hardware requirement documents, and any other items used by the engineering launch countdown teams during real launch countdown operations are used during the simulation.\nThe Space Shuttle vehicle hardware and related GSE hardware is simulated by [[mathematical models]] (written in Shuttle Ground Operations Simulator (SGOS) modeling language <ref>Shuttle Ground Operations Simulator (SGOS) Summary Description Manual.  National Aeronautics and Space Administration KSC Document # KSC-LPS-SGOS-1000, Revision 3 CHG-A, 1995.</ref>) that behave and react like real hardware.  During the Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation, engineers command and control hardware via real application software executing in the control consoles \u2013 just as if they were commanding real vehicle hardware.  However, these real software applications do not interface with real Shuttle hardware during simulations.  Instead, the applications interface with mathematical model representations of the vehicle and GSE hardware.  Consequently, the simulations bypass sensitive and even dangerous mechanisms while providing engineering measurements detailing how the hardware would have reacted.  Since these math models interact with the command and control application software, models and simulations are also used to debug and verify the functionality of application software.<ref>Math Model Main Propulsion System (MPS) Requirements Document, National Aeronautics and Space Administration KSC Document # KSCL-1100-0522, Revision 9, June 2009.</ref>\n\n===Satellite navigation===\nThe only true way to test [[GNSS]] receivers (commonly known as Sat-Nav's in the commercial world)is by using an RF Constellation Simulator. A receiver that may for example be used on an aircraft, can be tested under dynamic conditions without the need to take it on a real flight. The test conditions can be repeated exactly, and there is full control over all the test parameters. this is not possible in the 'real-world' using the actual signals. For testing receivers that will use the new [[Galileo (satellite navigation)]] there is no alternative, as the real signals do not yet exist.\n\n===Weather===\nPredicting weather conditions by extrapolating/interpolating previous data is one of the real use of simulation. Most of the weather forecasts use this information published by Weather buereaus. This kind of simulations help in predicting and forewarning about extreme weather conditions like the path of an active hurricane/cyclone.\n[[Numerical weather prediction]] for forecasting involves complicated numeric computer models to predict weather accurately by taking many parameters into account.\n\n==Simulation games==\n{{Main|Simulation game}}\n[[Strategy game]]s\u2014both traditional and modern\u2014may be viewed as simulations of abstracted decision-making for the purpose of training military and political leaders (see [[History of Go]] for an example of such a tradition, or [[Kriegsspiel (wargame)|Kriegsspiel]] for a more recent example).\n\nMany other video games are simulators of some kind. Such games can simulate various aspects of reality, from [[business simulation game|business]], to [[Government simulation|government]], to [[Construction and management simulation games|construction]], to [[Vehicle simulation game|piloting vehicles]] (see above).\n\n==Historical usage==\nHistorically, the word had negative connotations:\n\n{{quote|text=\u2026therefore a general custom of simulation (which is this last degree) is a vice, using either of a natural falseness or fearfulness\u2026|sign=[[Francis Bacon]]|source=Of Simulation and Dissimulation, 1597}}\n\n{{quote|text=\u2026for Distinction Sake, a Deceiving by Words, is commonly called a Lye, and a Deceiving by Actions, Gestures, or Behavior, is called Simulation\u2026|sign=[[Robert South]]|source=South, 1697, p.525}}\n\nHowever, the connection between simulation and [[dissembling]] later faded out and is now only of linguistic interest.<ref>South, in the passage quoted, was speaking of the differences between a falsehood and an honestly mistaken statement; the difference being that in order for the statement to be a [[lie]] the [[truth]] must be known, and the opposite of the truth must have been knowingly uttered. And, from this, to the extent to which a '''lie''' involves deceptive ''words'', a '''simulation''' involves deceptive ''actions'', deceptive ''gestures'', or deceptive ''behavior''. Thus, it would seem, if a simulation is '''false''', then the truth must be known (in order for ''something other than the truth'' to be presented in its stead); and, for the '''simulation''' to ''simulate''. Because, otherwise, one would not know what to offer up in simulation. Bacon's essay [http://www.authorama.com/essays-of-francis-bacon-7.html Of Simulation and Dissimulation] expresses somewhat similar views; it is also significant that [[Samuel Johnson]] thought so highly of South's definition, that he used it in the entry for simulation in his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary of the English Language]]''.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{cmn|2|\n* [[Computer experiment]]\n* [[Dissimulation]]\n* [[Emulator]]\n* [[Futures studies]]\n* [[Grey box model]]\n* [[High-level emulation]]\n* [[Illustris project]]\n* [[in silico]]\n* [[Lifelike experience]]\n* [[List of discrete event simulation software]]\n* [[List of computer simulation software]]\n* [[Mathematical model]]\n* [[Conceptual model|Model]]\n* [[Rule-based modeling]]\n* [[Merger simulation]]\n* [[Microarchitecture simulation]]\n* [[Mining simulator]]\n* [[Molecular dynamics]]\n* [[Network simulation]]\n* [[Pharmacokinetics simulation]]\n* [[Placebo]]\n* [[Project management simulation]]\n* [[Roleplay simulation]]\n* [[Simulation language]]\n* [[Similitude (model)]]\n* [[Simulated reality]]\n* [[System identification]]\n* [[Training simulation]]\n* [[Virtual training]]\n* [[Web-based simulation]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Simulation}}\n{{Wiktionary|simulation}}\n* [http://www.unice.fr/sg/resources/bibliographies.htm Bibliographies containing more references] to be found on the website of the journal [http://www.unice.fr/sg/ ''Simulation & Gaming''].\n* A further description and examples of applying discrete event simulation modeling to industry may be seen at [http://www.simutech.com.au/production-design-and-simulation/ ''Production Design and Simulation''].\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Operations research]]\n[[Category:Simulation| ]]"}]}}}}
