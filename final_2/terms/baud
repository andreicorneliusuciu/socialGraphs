It is the number of distinct [[symbol (data)|symbol]] changes (signaling events) made to the transmission medium per [[second]] in a digitally [[modulation|modulated]] signal or a [[line code]].\n\nDigital data modem manufacturers commonly define the baud as the modulation rate of data transmission and express it as [[bit]]s per second.<ref>AT&T, Bell System Data Communications Technical Reference, ''[http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/westernElectric/telephony/modems/103F_Interface_Specification_May64.pdf Data Set 103F Interface Specification]'', May 1964</ref>\n\nBaud is related to [[gross bit rate]] expressed as bits per second.\n\n==Definitions==\nThe '''symbol duration time''', also known as [[Unit interval (data transmission)|unit interval]], can be directly measured as the time between transitions by looking into an [[eye diagram]] of an [[oscilloscope]]. The symbol duration time ''T''<sub>s</sub> can be calculated as:\n\n:<math> T_s  =  {1 \\over f_s}, </math>\n\nwhere ''f''<sub>s</sub> is the symbol rate.\nThere is also a chance of miscommunication which leads to ambiguity.\n\n:Example: a baud of 1 kBd = 1,000 Bd is synonymous to a symbol rate of 1,000 symbols per second. In case of a [[modem]], this corresponds to 1,000 tones per second, and in case of a line code, this corresponds to 1,000 pulses per second. The symbol duration time is 1/1,000 second = 1 millisecond.\n\nIn [[Digital data|digital]] systems (i.e., using discrete/discontinuous values) with [[binary code]], 1 Bd = 1 bit/s. By contrast, non-digital (or [[Analog signal|analog]]) systems use a continuous range of values to represent information and in these systems the exact informational size of 1 Bd varies.\n\nThe baud unit is named after [[\u00c9mile Baudot]], the inventor of the [[Baudot code]] for [[telegraphy]], and is represented in accordance with the rules for [[International System of Units|SI units]]. That is, the first letter of its symbol is uppercase (Bd), but when the unit is spelled out, it should be written in lowercase (baud) except when it begins a sentence.\n\nThe baud is scaled using standard [[metric prefix]]es, so that for example\n*1 kBd (kilobaud) = 1000 Bd\n*1 MBd (megabaud) = 1000 kBd\n*1 GBd (gigabaud) = 1000 MBd.\n\n==Relationship to gross bit rate==\nThe symbol rate is related to [[gross bit rate]] expressed in bit/s.\nThe term baud has sometimes incorrectly been used to mean bit rate,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.textfiles.com/apple/bitsbaud.txt |title=BITS, BAUD RATE, AND BPS Taking the Mystery Out of Modem Speeds |last1=Banks |first1=Michael A. |date=1990 |publisher=Brady Books/Simon & Schuster |accessdate=17 September 2014}}</ref> since these rates are the same in old [[modem]]s as well as in the simplest digital communication links using only one bit per symbol, such that binary \"0\" is represented by one symbol, and binary \"1\" by another symbol. In more advanced modems and data transmission techniques, a symbol may have more than two states, so it may represent more than one [[bit]]. A bit (binary digit) always represents one of two states.\n\nIf ''N'' bits are conveyed per symbol, and the gross bit rate is ''R'', inclusive of channel coding overhead, the symbol rate ''f''<sub>s</sub> can be calculated as\n\n:<math>  f_\\mathrm{s}  =   {R \\over N}. </math>\n\nBy taking information per pulse ''N'' in bit/pulse to be the base-2-[[logarithm]] of the number of distinct messages ''M'' that could be sent, [[Ralph Hartley|Hartley]]<ref>{{cite book | title = Information Theory and its Engineering Applications | author = D. A. Bell | edition = 3rd | year = 1962 | publisher = Pitman | location = New York |oclc=1626214}}</ref> constructed a measure of the [[gross bitrate]] ''R'' as\n\n:<math>  R  =   f_\\mathrm{s} N\\quad  </math>  where <math>\\quad N = \\log_2(M).</math>\n\nIn that case ''M''&thinsp;=&thinsp;2<sup>''N''</sup> different symbols are used. In a modem, these may be sinewave tones with unique combinations of amplitude, phase and/or frequency. For example, in a [[64QAM]] modem, ''M''=64, and so the bit rate is ''N''&thinsp;=&thinsp;log<sub>2</sub>(64)&thinsp;=&thinsp;6 times the baud. In a line code, these may be ''M'' different voltage levels.\n\nThe ratio is not necessarily even an integer; in [[4B3T]] coding, the bit rate is 4/3 baud.  (A typical [[basic rate interface]] with a 160 kbit/s raw data rate operates at 120 kBd.) \n\nCodes with many symbols, and thus a bit rate higher than the symbol rate, are most useful on channels such as telephone lines with a limited bandwidth but a high [[signal-to-noise ratio]] within that bandwidth.  In other applications, the bit rate is less than the symbol rate.  [[Manchester coding]] and [[modified frequency modulation]] have a bit rate equal to 1/2 the baud.  [[Eight-to-fourteen modulation]] as used on audio CDs has  bit rate which 8/17 of the baud.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bandwidth (computing)|Bandwidth]]\n* [[Baudot code]]\n* [[Bitrate]]\n* [[Constellation diagram]], which shows (on a graph or 2D oscilloscope image) how a given signal state (a symbol) can represent three or more bits at once\n* [[List of device bandwidths]]\n* [[Modem]]\n* [[Modulation]]\n* [[Nyquist rate]]\n* [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]]\n* [[Symbol rate]]\n*[[8-N-1]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite journal\n| title=On the origins of serial communications and data encoding\n| url=http://www.dbase.com/Knowledgebase/dbulletin/bu07sh.htm\n| first=Nicolas | last=Martin\n| journal=dBulletin, the dBASE Developers Bulletin |issue=7 |date=January 2000\n| accessdate=January 4, 2007\n}}\n* {{cite journal |title=What\u2019s The Difference Between Bit Rate And baud?\n| first=Lou | last=Frenzel\n| journal=Electronic Design Magazine |date=April 27, 2012\n| url=http://electronicdesign.com/communications/what-s-difference-between-bit-rate-and-baud-rate\n}}\n[[Category:Data transmission]]\n[[Category:Units of frequency]]"}]}}}}
