The primary benefit of a wheatstone bridge is its ability to provide extremely accurate measurements (in contrast with something like a simple [[voltage divider]]).<ref>\"Circuits in Practice: The Wheatstone Bridge, What It Does, and Why It Matters\", as discussed in this MIT ES.333 class [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-G-dySnSSG4 video]</ref> Its operation is similar to the original [[Potentiometer (measuring instrument)|potentiometer]]. \n\nThe Wheatstone bridge was invented by [[Samuel Hunter Christie]] in 1833 and improved and popularized by Sir [[Charles Wheatstone]] in 1843.  One of the Wheatstone bridge's initial uses was for the purpose of soils analysis and comparison.<ref>\"The Genesis of the Wheatstone Bridge\" by Stig Ekelof discusses [[Samuel Hunter Christie|Christie's]] and [[Charles Wheatstone|Wheatstone]]'s contributions, and why the bridge carries Wheatstone's name. Published in \"Engineering Science and Education Journal\", volume 10, no 1, February 2001, pages 37\u201340.</ref>\n\n== Operation ==\nIn the figure, <math>\\scriptstyle R_x</math> is the unknown resistance to be measured; <math>\\scriptstyle R_1,</math> <math>\\scriptstyle R_2,</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle R_3</math> are resistors of known resistance and the resistance of <math>\\scriptstyle R_2</math> is adjustable. If the ratio of the two resistances in the known leg <math>\\scriptstyle (R_2 / R_1)</math> is equal to the ratio of the two in the unknown leg <math>\\scriptstyle (R_x / R_3),</math> then the [[voltage]] between the two midpoints ('''B''' and '''D''') will be zero and no [[Current (electricity)|current]] will flow through the [[galvanometer]] <math>\\scriptstyle V_g.</math> If the bridge is unbalanced, the direction of the current indicates whether <math>\\scriptstyle R_2</math> is too high or too low. <math>\\scriptstyle R_2</math> is varied until there is no current through the galvanometer, which then reads zero.\n\nDetecting zero current with a [[galvanometer]] can be done to extremely high accuracy. Therefore, if <math>\\scriptstyle R_1,</math> <math>\\scriptstyle R_2,</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle R_3</math> are known to high precision, then <math>\\scriptstyle R_x</math> can be measured to high precision. Very small changes in <math>\\scriptstyle R_x</math> disrupt the balance and are readily detected.\n\nAt the point of balance, the ratio of\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\frac{R_2}{R_1} &= \\frac{R_x}{R_3} \\\\[4pt]\n  \\Rightarrow R_x &= \\frac{R_2}{R_1} \\cdot R_3\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAlternatively, if <math>\\scriptstyle R_1,</math> <math>\\scriptstyle R_2,</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle R_3</math> are known, but <math>\\scriptstyle R_2</math> is not adjustable, the voltage difference across or current flow through the meter can be used to calculate the value of <math>\\scriptstyle R_x,</math> using [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] (also known as Kirchhoff's rules). This setup is frequently used in [[strain gauge]] and [[resistance thermometer]] measurements, as it is usually faster to read a voltage level off a meter than to adjust a resistance to zero the voltage.\n\n==Derivation==\n[[File:Wheatstonebridge current.svg|thumb|300px|Directions of currents arbitrarily assigned]]\nFirst, [[Kirchoff's first law|Kirchhoff's first rule]] is used to find the currents in junctions '''B''' and '''D''':\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  I_3 - I_x + I_G &= 0 \\\\\n  I_1 - I_2 - I_G &= 0\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThen, [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws#Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL)|Kirchhoff's second rule]] is used for finding the voltage in the loops '''ABD''' and '''BCD''':\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  (I_3 \\cdot R_3) - (I_G \\cdot R_G) - (I_1 \\cdot R_1) &= 0 \\\\\n  (I_x \\cdot R_x) - (I_2 \\cdot R_2) + (I_G \\cdot R_G) &= 0\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nWhen the bridge is balanced, then {{math|''I''<sub>''G''</sub> {{=}} 0}}, so the second set of equations can be rewritten as:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  I_3 \\cdot R_3 &= I_1 \\cdot R_1 \\\\\n  I_x \\cdot R_x &= I_2 \\cdot R_2\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThen, the equations are divided and rearranged, giving:\n:<math>R_x = {{R_2 \\cdot I_2 \\cdot I_3 \\cdot R_3}\\over{R_1 \\cdot I_1 \\cdot I_x}}</math>\n\nFrom the first rule, {{math|''I''<sub>3</sub> {{=}} ''I''<sub>''x''</sub>}} and {{math|''I''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} ''I''<sub>2</sub>}}.  The desired value of {{math|''R''<sub>''x''</sub>}} is now known to be given as:\n:<math>R_x = {{R_3 \\cdot R_2}\\over{R_1}}</math>\n\nIf all four resistor values and the supply voltage ({{math|''V''<sub>''S''</sub>}}) are known, and the resistance of the galvanometer is high enough that {{math|''I''<sub>''G''</sub>}} is negligible, the voltage across the bridge ({{math|''V''<sub>''G''</sub>}}) can be found by working out the voltage from each [[potential divider]] and subtracting one from the other. The equation for this is:\n:<math>V_G = \\left({R_2\\over{R_1 + R_2}} - {R_x \\over {R_x + R_3}}\\right)V_s</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''V''<sub>''G''</sub>}} is the voltage of node D relative to node B.\n\n== Significance ==\n\nThe Wheatstone bridge illustrates the concept of a difference measurement, which can be extremely accurate. Variations on the Wheatstone bridge can be used to measure [[capacitance]], [[inductance]], [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] and other quantities, such as the amount of combustible gases in a sample, with an [[explosimeter]].  The [[Kelvin bridge]] was specially adapted from the Wheatstone bridge for measuring very low resistances.  In many cases, the significance of measuring the unknown resistance is related to measuring the impact of some physical phenomenon (such as force, temperature, pressure, etc.) which thereby allows the use of Wheatstone bridge in measuring those elements indirectly.\n\nThe concept was extended to [[alternating current]] measurements by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1865 and further improved by [[Alan Blumlein]] around 1926.\n\n==Modifications of the fundamental bridge==\n[[File:Kelvin bridge by RFT.png|right|thumb|300px|[[Kelvin bridge]]]]\nThe Wheatstone bridge is the fundamental bridge, but there are other modifications that can be made to measure various kinds of resistances when the fundamental Wheatstone bridge is not suitable. Some of the modifications are:\n* [[Carey Foster bridge]], for measuring small resistances\n* [[Kelvin bridge]], for measuring small [[Four-terminal sensing|four-terminal]] resistances\n* [[Maxwell bridge]], for measuring [[Electrical reactance|reactive]] components.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Phantom circuit]] \u2013 a circuit using a balanced bridge\n* [[Post Office Box (electricity)|Post Office Box]]\n* [[Potentiometer]]\n* [[Potential divider]]\n* [[Ohmmeter]]\n* [[Resistance thermometer]]\n* [[Strain gauge]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/DC/DC_8.html ''DC Metering Circuits''] chapter from [http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/DC/index.html ''Lessons In Electric Circuits Vol 1 DC''] free ebook and [http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/ ''Lessons In Electric Circuits''] series.\n* [https://nationalmaglab.org/education/magnet-academy/watch-play/interactive/wheatstone-bridge Wheatstone Bridge \u2013 Interactive Tutorial] National High Magnetic Field Laboratory\n* [http://radionerds.com/index.php/I-49 Test Set I-49] \n\n{{Bridge circuits}}\n{{Sensors}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wheatstone Bridge}}\n[[Category:Electrical meters]]\n[[Category:Bridge circuits]]\n[[Category:Measuring instruments]]\n[[Category:English inventions]]\n[[Category:Impedance measurements]]"}]}}}}
