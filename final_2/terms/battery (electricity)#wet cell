Many used glass jars to hold their components, which made them fragile and potentially dangerous. These characteristics made wet cells unsuitable for portable appliances.

In this example the two half-cells are linked by a [[salt bridge]] separator that permits the transfer of ions.]]\n\nBatteries convert chemical energy directly to electrical energy. A battery consists of some number of voltaic cells. Each cell consists of two [[half-cell]]s connected in series by a conductive electrolyte containing anions and cations. One half-cell includes electrolyte and the negative electrode, the electrode to which [[Ion#Anions and cations|anions]] (negatively charged ions) migrate; the other half-cell includes electrolyte and the positive electrode to which [[Ion#Anions and cations|cations]] (positively charged ions) migrate. [[Redox]] reactions power the battery. Cations are reduced (electrons are added) at the cathode during charging, while anions are oxidized (electrons are removed) at the anode during charging.<ref>Dingrando 665.</ref> During discharge, the process is reversed. The electrodes do not touch each other, but are electrically connected by the [[electrolyte]]. Some cells use different electrolytes for each half-cell. A separator allows ions to flow between half-cells, but prevents mixing of the electrolytes.\n\nEach half-cell has an [[electromotive force]] (or emf), determined by its ability to drive electric current from the interior to the exterior of the cell. The net emf of the cell is the difference between the emfs of its half-cells.<ref name=\"Saslow 338\">Saslow 338.</ref> Thus, if the electrodes have emfs <math>\\mathcal{E}_1</math> and <math>\\mathcal{E}_2</math>, then the net emf is <math>\\mathcal{E}_{2}-\\mathcal{E}_{1}</math>; in other words, the net emf is the difference between the [[reduction potential]]s of the [[half-reaction]]s.<ref>Dingrando 666.</ref>\n\nThe electrical driving force or <math>\\displaystyle{\\Delta V_{bat}}</math> across the [[battery terminal|terminals]] of a cell is known as the ''terminal voltage (difference)'' and is measured in [[volt]]s.<ref name=\"pse943\">Knight 943.</ref> The terminal voltage of a cell that is neither charging nor discharging is called the [[open-circuit voltage]] and equals the emf of the cell. Because of internal resistance,<ref name=\"pse976\">Knight 976.</ref> the terminal voltage of a cell that is discharging is smaller in magnitude than the open-circuit voltage and the terminal voltage of a cell that is charging exceeds the open-circuit voltage.<ref>[http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0030399.html Terminal Voltage \u2013 Tiscali Reference]. Originally from ''Hutchinson Encyclopaedia''. Retrieved 7 April 2007.</ref> An ideal cell has negligible internal resistance, so it would maintain a constant terminal voltage of <math>\\mathcal{E}</math> until exhausted, then dropping to zero. If such a cell maintained 1.5 volts and stored a charge of one [[coulomb]] then on complete discharge it would perform 1.5 [[joule]]s of work.<ref name=pse943 /> In actual cells, the internal resistance increases under discharge<ref name=\"pse976\" /> and the open circuit voltage also decreases under discharge. If the voltage and resistance are plotted against time, the resulting graphs typically are a curve; the shape of the curve varies according to the chemistry and internal arrangement employed.\n\nThe voltage developed across a cell's terminals depends on the energy release of the chemical reactions of its electrodes and electrolyte. [[Alkaline battery|Alkaline]] and [[Zinc\u2013carbon battery|zinc\u2013carbon]] cells have different chemistries, but approximately the same emf of 1.5 volts; likewise [[Nickel\u2013cadmium battery|NiCd]] and [[Nickel\u2013metal hydride battery|NiMH]] cells have different chemistries, but approximately the same emf of 1.2 volts.<ref>Dingrando 674.</ref> The high electrochemical potential changes in the reactions of [[lithium]] compounds give lithium cells emfs of 3 volts or more.<ref>Dingrando 677.</ref>\n\n== Categories and types of batteries ==\n{{Main|List of battery types}}\n[[File:Batteries comparison 4,5 D C AA AAA AAAA A23 9V CR2032 LR44 matchstick-vertical.jpeg|thumb|upright|From top to bottom: a large 4.5-volt (3R12) battery, a ''[[D battery|D Cell]]'', a ''[[C battery|C cell]]'', an ''[[AA cell]]'', an ''[[AAA cell]]'', an ''[[AAAA battery|AAAA cell]]'', an ''[[A23 battery]]'', a 9-volt ''[[PP3 battery]]'', and a pair of [[button cell]]s (CR2032 and LR44)]]\n\nBatteries are classified into primary and secondary forms:\n\n* ''Primary'' batteries are designed to be used until exhausted of energy then discarded.  Their chemical reactions are generally not reversible, so they cannot be recharged. When the supply of reactants in the battery is exhausted, the battery stops producing current and is useless.<ref>Dingrando 675.</ref>\n* ''Secondary'' batteries can be recharged; that is, they can have their chemical reactions reversed by applying [[electric current]] to the cell.  This regenerates the original chemical reactants, so they can be used, recharged, and used again multiple times.<ref>Fink, Ch. 11, Sec. \"Batteries and Fuel Cells.\"</ref>\n\nSome types of primary batteries used, for example, for [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] circuits, were restored to operation by replacing the electrodes.<ref>[[Franklin Leonard Pope]], ''Modern Practice of the Electric Telegraph 15th Edition'', D. Van Nostrand Company, New York, 1899, pages 7\u201311. Available on the [[Internet Archive]]</ref> Secondary batteries are not indefinitely rechargeable due to dissipation of the active materials, loss of electrolyte and internal corrosion.\n\n=== Primary ===\n{{Main|Primary cell}}\n\nPrimary batteries, or [[primary cell]]s, can produce current immediately on assembly. These are most commonly used in portable devices that have low current drain, are used only intermittently, or are used well away from an alternative power source, such as in alarm and communication circuits where other electric power is only intermittently available. Disposable primary cells cannot be reliably recharged, since the chemical reactions are not easily reversible and active materials may not return to their original forms. Battery manufacturers recommend against attempting to recharge primary cells.<ref name=\"durcar\">[http://www.duracell.com/care_disposal/care.asp Duracell: Battery Care].

''Energizer''. Retrieved 25 August 2008.</ref> but disposable batteries do not fare well under high-drain applications with [[electrical load|loads]] under 75 [[ohm]]s (75 \u03a9). Common types of disposable batteries include [[zinc\u2013carbon batteries]] and [[alkaline batteries]].\n\n=== Secondary  ===\n{{Main|Rechargeable battery}}\n\nSecondary batteries, also known as ''secondary cells'', or ''rechargeable batteries'', must be charged before first use; they are usually assembled with active materials in the discharged state. Rechargeable batteries are (re)charged by applying electric current, which reverses the chemical reactions that occur during discharge/use. Devices to supply the appropriate current are called chargers.\n\nThe oldest form of rechargeable battery is the [[lead\u2013acid battery]], which are widely used in [[automotive]] and [[boating]] applications. This technology contains liquid electrolyte in an unsealed container, requiring that the battery be kept upright and the area be well ventilated to ensure safe dispersal of the [[hydrogen]] gas it produces during overcharging. The lead\u2013acid battery is relatively heavy for the amount of electrical energy it can supply. Its low manufacturing cost and its high surge current levels make it common where its capacity (over approximately 10 Ah) is more important than weight and handling issues. A common application is the modern [[car battery]], which can, in general, deliver a peak current of 450 [[ampere]]s.\n\nThe sealed [[valve regulated lead\u2013acid battery]] (VRLA battery) is popular in the automotive industry as a replacement for the lead\u2013acid wet cell. The VRLA battery uses an immobilized [[sulfuric acid]] electrolyte, reducing the chance of leakage and extending [[shelf life]].<ref>[http://www.cdtechno.com/custserv/pdf/7327.pdf Dynasty VRLA Batteries and Their Application]. ''C&D Technologies, Inc.'' Retrieved 26 August 2008.</ref> VRLA batteries immobilize the electrolyte. The two types are:\n\n* ''[[Gel batteries]]'' (or \"gel cell\") use a semi-solid electrolyte.\n* ''[[Absorbed Glass Mat]]'' (AGM) batteries absorb the electrolyte in a special fiberglass matting.\n\nOther portable rechargeable batteries include several sealed \"dry cell\" types, that are useful in applications such as mobile phones and [[Laptop|laptop computers]]. Cells of this type (in order of increasing [[power density]] and cost) include [[Nickel\u2013cadmium battery|nickel\u2013cadmium]] (NiCd), [[Nickel\u2013zinc battery|nickel\u2013zinc]] (NiZn), [[Nickel metal hydride battery|nickel metal hydride]] (NiMH), and [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion]] (Li-ion) cells. Li-ion has by far the highest share of the dry cell rechargeable market. NiMH has replaced NiCd in most applications due to its higher capacity, but NiCd remains in use in [[power tool]]s, [[two-way radio]]s, and [[medical equipment]].\n\nIn the 2000s, developments include batteries with embedded electronics such as [[USBCELL]], which allows charging an AA battery through a [[USB]] connector,<ref>[http://www.usbcell.com/ USBCELL \u2013 Revolutionary rechargeable USB battery that can charge from any USB port]. Retrieved 6 November 2007.</ref> [[nanoball batteries]] that allow for a discharge rate about 100x greater than current batteries,  and [[smart battery]] packs with state-of-charge monitors and battery protection circuits that prevent damage on over-discharge. [[Low self-discharge NiMH battery|Low self-discharge]] (LSD) allows secondary cells to be charged prior to shipping.\n\n=== Cell types ===\nMany types of electrochemical cells have been produced, with varying chemical processes and designs, including [[galvanic cell]]s, [[electrolytic cell]]s, [[fuel cell]]s, [[flow battery|flow cells]] and voltaic piles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pspb.org/e21/media/Compare_pvfc_v108_TN.pdf |title=Spotlight on Photovoltaics & Fuel Cells: A Web-based Study & Comparison |accessdate=14 March 2007 |format=PDF |pages=1\u20132 }}</ref>\n\n==== Wet cell ====\nA ''wet cell'' battery has a liquid [[electrolyte]]. Other names are ''flooded cell'', since the liquid covers all internal parts, or ''vented cell'', since gases produced during operation can escape to the air. Wet cells were a precursor to dry cells and are commonly used as a learning tool for [[electrochemistry]]. They can be built with common laboratory supplies, such as [[beaker (glassware)|beakers]], for demonstrations of how electrochemical cells work. A particular type of wet cell known as a [[concentration cell]] is important in understanding [[corrosion]]. Wet cells may be [[primary cell]]s (non-rechargeable) or [[secondary cell]]s (rechargeable). Originally, all practical primary batteries such as the [[Daniell cell]] were built as open-top glass jar wet cells. Other primary wet cells are the [[Leclanche cell]], [[Grove cell]], [[Bunsen cell]], [[Chromic acid cell]], [[Clark cell]], and [[Weston cell]]. The Leclanche cell chemistry was adapted to the first dry cells. Wet cells are still used in [[car battery|automobile batteries]] and in industry for standby power for [[switchgear]], telecommunication or large [[uninterruptible power supply|uninterruptible power supplies]], but in many places batteries with [[gel cell]]s have been used instead. These applications commonly use lead\u2013acid or [[Nickel\u2013cadmium battery (vented cell type)|nickel\u2013cadmium]] cells.\n\n==== Dry cell ====\n{{Further|Dry cell}}\n[[File:Dry cell (PSF).png|thumb|upright|Line art drawing of a dry cell: <br /> 1. brass cap, 2. plastic seal, 3. expansion space, 4. porous cardboard, 5. zinc can, 6. carbon rod, 7. chemical mixture]]\n\nA ''dry cell'' uses a paste electrolyte, with only enough moisture to allow current to flow. Unlike a wet cell, a dry cell can operate in any orientation without spilling, as it contains no free liquid, making it suitable for portable equipment. By comparison, the first wet cells were typically fragile glass containers with lead rods hanging from the open top and needed careful handling to avoid spillage. Lead\u2013acid batteries did not achieve the safety and portability of the dry cell until the development of the [[gel battery]].\n\nA common dry cell is the [[zinc\u2013carbon battery]], sometimes called the dry [[Leclanch\u00e9 cell]], with a nominal voltage of 1.5 [[volt]]s, the same as the [[alkaline battery]] (since both use the same [[zinc]]\u2013[[manganese dioxide]] combination). A standard dry cell comprises a [[zinc]] anode, usually in the form of a cylindrical pot, with a [[carbon]] cathode in the form of a central rod. The electrolyte is [[ammonium chloride]] in the form of a paste next to the zinc anode. The remaining space between the electrolyte and carbon cathode is taken up by a second paste consisting of ammonium chloride and manganese dioxide, the latter acting as a [[depolariser]]. In some designs, the ammonium chloride is replaced by [[zinc chloride]].\n\n==== Molten salt ====\n[[Molten salt battery|Molten salt batteries]] are primary or secondary batteries that use a molten salt as electrolyte. They operate at high temperatures and must be well insulated to retain heat.\n\n==== Reserve ====\nA [[reserve battery]] can be stored unassembled (unactivated and supplying no power) for a long period (perhaps years).  When the battery is needed, then it is assembled (e.g., by adding electrolyte); once assembled, the battery is charged and ready to work.  For example, a battery for an electronic artillery [[fuze]] might be activated by the impact of firing a gun: The acceleration breaks a capsule of electrolyte that activates the battery and powers the fuze's circuits. Reserve batteries are usually designed for a short service life (seconds or minutes) after long storage (years). A [[water-activated battery]] for oceanographic instruments or military applications becomes activated on immersion in water.\n\n=== Cell performance ===\nA battery's characteristics may vary over load cycle, over [[charge cycle]], and over lifetime due to many factors including internal chemistry, [[Electric current|current]] drain, and temperature. At low temperatures, a battery cannot deliver as much power. As such, in cold climates, some car owners install battery warmers, which are small electric heating pads that keep the car battery warm.\n\n== Capacity and discharge ==\n[[File:Battery checker.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A device to check battery voltage]]\n\nA battery's ''capacity'' is the amount of [[electric charge]] it can deliver at the rated voltage. The more electrode material contained in the cell the greater its capacity. A small cell has less capacity than a larger cell with the same chemistry, although they develop the same open-circuit voltage.<ref name=aappc /> Capacity is measured in units such as [[amp-hour]] (A\u00b7h). The rated capacity of a battery is usually expressed as the product of 20 hours multiplied by the current that a new battery can consistently supply for 20 hours at {{convert|68|F|C}}, while remaining above a specified terminal voltage per cell. For example, a battery rated at 100 A\u00b7h can deliver 5 A over a 20-hour period at [[room temperature]]. The fraction of the stored charge that a battery can deliver depends on multiple factors, including battery chemistry, the rate at which the charge is delivered (current), the required terminal voltage, the storage period, ambient temperature and other factors.<ref name=\"aappc\">[http://www.aaportablepower.com/BatteryKnowledge/BatteryKnowledge.asp Battery Knowledge&nbsp;\u2013 AA Portable Power Corp. Retrieved 16 April 2007.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523105752/http://www.aaportablepower.com/BatteryKnowledge/BatteryKnowledge.asp |date=23 May 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe higher the discharge rate, the lower the capacity.<ref name=\"techlib\">{{cite web|url=http://www.techlib.com/reference/batteries.html|title=Battery Capacity|work=techlib.com}}</ref> The relationship between current, discharge time and capacity for a lead acid battery is approximated (over a typical range of current values) by [[Peukert's law]]:\n\n:<math>t = \\frac {Q_P} {I^k}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>Q_P</math> is the capacity when discharged at a rate of 1 amp.\n:<math>I</math> is the current drawn from battery ([[Amperes|A]]).\n:<math>t</math> is the amount of time (in hours) that a battery can sustain.\n:<math>k</math> is a constant around 1.3.\n\nBatteries that are stored for a long period or that are discharged at a small fraction of the capacity lose capacity due to the presence of generally irreversible ''side reactions'' that consume charge carriers without producing current. This phenomenon is known as internal self-discharge. Further, when batteries are recharged, additional side reactions can occur, reducing capacity for subsequent discharges. After enough recharges, in essence all capacity is lost and the battery stops producing power.\n\nInternal energy losses and limitations on the rate that ions pass through the electrolyte cause battery [[Efficient energy use|efficiency]] to vary. Above a minimum threshold, discharging at a low rate delivers more of the battery's capacity than at a higher rate. Installing batteries with varying A\u00b7h ratings does not affect device operation (although it may affect the operation interval) rated for a specific voltage unless load limits are exceeded. High-drain loads such as [[digital camera]]s can reduce total capacity, as happens with alkaline batteries. For example, a battery rated at 2&nbsp;A\u00b7h for a 10- or 20-hour discharge would not sustain a current of 1&nbsp;A for a full two hours as its stated capacity implies.\n\n=== C rate ===\nThe C-rate is a measure of the rate at which a battery is being discharged. It is defined as the discharge current divided by the theoretical current draw under which the battery would deliver its nominal rated capacity in one hour.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/evt/summary_battery_specifications.pdf A Guide to Understanding Battery Specifications], MIT Electric Vehicle Team, December 2008</ref> A 1C discharge rate would deliver the battery's rated capacity in 1 hour.  A 2C discharge rate means it will discharge twice as fast (30 minutes). A 1C discharge rate on a 1.6 Ah battery means a discharge current of 1.6 A. A 2C rate would mean a discharge current of 3.2 A. Standards for rechargeable batteries generally rate the capacity over a 4-hour, 8 hour or longer discharge time. Because of internal resistance loss and the chemical processes inside the cells, a battery rarely delivers nameplate rated capacity in only one hour. Types intended for special purposes, such as in a computer [[uninterruptible power supply]], may be rated by manufacturers for discharge periods much less than one hour.\n\n=== Fast-charging, large and light batteries ===\n{{As of|2012}}, [[lithium iron phosphate|lithium iron phosphate ({{chem|LiFePO|4}}) battery technology]] was the fastest-charging/discharging, fully discharging in 10\u201320 seconds.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kang | first1 = B. | last2 = Ceder | first2 = G. | doi = 10.1038/nature07853 | title = Battery materials for ultrafast charging and discharging | journal = Nature | volume = 458 | issue = 7235 | pages = 190\u2013193 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19279634| pmc = |bibcode = 2009Natur.458..190K }} [http://media.nature.com/download/nature/nature/podcast/v458/n7235/nature-2009-03-12.mp3 1:00\u20136:50 (audio)]</ref>\n\n{{As of|2013}}, the world's largest battery was in [[Hebei Province]], China.

For rechargeables, it can mean either the length of time a device can run on a fully charged battery or the number of charge/discharge cycles possible before the cells fail to operate satisfactorily. For a non-rechargeable these two lives are equal since the cells last for only one cycle by definition. (The term shelf life is used to describe how long a battery will retain its performance between manufacture and use.) Available capacity of all batteries drops with decreasing temperature. In contrast to most of today's batteries, the [[Zamboni pile]], invented in 1812, offers a very long service life without refurbishment or recharge, although it supplies current only in the nanoamp range. The [[Oxford Electric Bell]] has been ringing almost continuously since 1840 on its original pair of batteries, thought to be Zamboni piles.\n\n=== Self-discharge ===\nDisposable batteries typically lose 8 to 20 percent of their original charge per year when stored at room temperature (20\u201330&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref>[http://www.corrosion-doctors.org/Batteries/self-compare.htm Self discharge of batteries \u2013 Corrosion Doctors]. Retrieved 9 September 2007.</ref> This is known as the \"self-discharge\" rate, and is due to non-current-producing \"side\" chemical reactions that occur within the cell even when no load is applied. The rate of side reactions is reduced for batteries are stored at lower temperatures, although some can be damaged by freezing.\n\nOld rechargeable batteries self-discharge more rapidly than disposable alkaline batteries, especially nickel-based batteries; a freshly charged nickel cadmium (NiCd) battery loses 10% of its charge in the first 24 hours, and thereafter discharges at a rate of about 10% a month. However, newer [[Low self-discharge NiMH battery|low self-discharge nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries]] and modern lithium designs display a lower self-discharge rate (but still higher than for primary batteries).\n\n=== Corrosion ===\nInternal parts may corrode and fail, or the active materials may be slowly converted to inactive forms.\n\n=== Physical component changes ===\n[[File:Recarreg\u00e1vel.JPG|thumb|right|Rechargeable batteries]]\nThe active material on the battery plates changes chemical composition on each charge and discharge cycle; active material may be lost due to physical changes of volume, further limiting the number of times the battery can be recharged.

Such storage can extend the life of alkaline batteries by about 5%; rechargeable batteries can hold their charge much longer, depending upon type.<ref>[http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20011219.html Ask Yahoo: Does putting batteries in the freezer make them last longer?].

Secondary cells are made in very large sizes; very large batteries can power a [[submarine]] or stabilize an [[electrical grid]] and help level out peak loads.\n\n== Hazards ==\n\n=== Explosion ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2012|reason=references were given, but only mentioned explosion due to extreme overheating}}\nA battery explosion is caused by misuse or malfunction, such as attempting to recharge a primary (non-rechargeable) battery, or a [[short circuit]]. Car batteries are most likely to explode when a short-circuit generates very large currents. Car batteries produce [[hydrogen]], which is very explosive, when they are overcharged (because of [[electrolysis]] of the water in the electrolyte). The amount of overcharging is usually very small and generates little hydrogen, which dissipates quickly. However, when \"jumping\" a car battery, the high current can cause the rapid release of large volumes of hydrogen, which can be ignited explosively by a nearby spark, for example, when disconnecting a [[jumper cable]]. When a battery is recharged at an excessive rate, an explosive gas mixture of hydrogen and oxygen may be produced faster than it can escape from within the battery, leading to pressure build-up and eventual bursting of the battery case. In extreme cases, battery acid may spray violently from the casing and cause injury. Overcharging\u2014that is, attempting to charge a battery beyond its electrical capacity\u2014can also lead to a battery explosion, in addition to leakage or irreversible damage. It may also cause damage to the charger or device in which the overcharged battery is later used. In addition, disposing of a battery via incineration may cause an explosion as steam builds up within the sealed case.\n\n=== Leakage ===\n[[File:LeakedBattery 2701a.jpg|thumb|right|Leak-damaged alkaline battery]]\n\nMany battery chemicals are corrosive, poisonous or both. If leakage occurs, either spontaneously or through accident, the chemicals released may be dangerous. For example, disposable batteries often use a zinc \"can\" both as a reactant and as the container to hold the other reagents. If this kind of battery is over-discharged, the reagents can emerge through the cardboard and plastic that form the remainder of the container. The active chemical leakage can then damage or disable the equipment that the batteries power. For this reason, many electronic device manufacturers recommend removing the batteries from devices that will not be used for extended periods of time.\n\n=== Toxic materials ===\nMany types of batteries employ toxic materials such as lead, [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[cadmium]] as an electrode or electrolyte. When each battery reaches end of life it must be disposed of to prevent environmental damage.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/epr/products/batteries.htm Batteries \u2013 Product Stewardship]. ''EPA''.

Ingested disk batteries do not usually cause problems unless they become lodged in the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. The most common place for disk batteries to become lodged is the esophagus, resulting in clinical sequelae. Batteries that successfully traverse the esophagus are unlikely to lodge elsewhere. The likelihood that a disk battery will lodge in the esophagus is a function of the patient's age and battery size.
