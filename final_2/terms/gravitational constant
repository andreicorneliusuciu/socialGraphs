Cavendish measured {{math|''G''}} implicitly, using a [[Torsion spring#Torsion balance|torsion balance]] invented by the geologist Rev. [[John Michell]]. He used a horizontal [[torsion beam]] with lead balls whose inertia (in relation to the torsion constant) he could tell by timing the beam's oscillation. Their faint attraction to other balls placed alongside the beam was detectable by the deflection it caused. Cavendish's aim was not actually to measure the gravitational constant, but rather to measure Earth's density relative to water, through the precise knowledge of the gravitational interaction.  In modern units, the density that Cavendish calculated implied a value for {{math|''G''}} of {{nowrap|{{val|6.754|e=\u221211|u=m<sup>3</sup> kg<sup>\u22121</sup> s<sup>\u22122</sup>}}}}.<ref>{{Citation |author1=Brush, Stephen G. |author2=Holton, Gerald James |title=Physics, the human adventure: from Copernicus to Einstein and beyond |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=New Brunswick, N.J |date=2001 |pages= 137 |isbn=0-8135-2908-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe accuracy of the measured value of {{math|''G''}} has increased only modestly since the original Cavendish experiment. {{math|''G''}} is quite difficult to measure, because gravity is much weaker than other fundamental forces, and an experimental apparatus cannot be separated from the gravitational influence of other bodies. Furthermore, gravity has no established relation to other fundamental forces, so it does not appear possible to calculate it indirectly from other constants that can be measured more accurately, as is done in some other areas of physics.  Published values of {{math|''G''}} have varied rather broadly, and some recent measurements of high precision are, in fact, mutually exclusive.<ref name=gillies/><ref name=codata2002>{{Citation |author1=Peter J.
