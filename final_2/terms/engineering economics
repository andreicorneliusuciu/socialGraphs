(1960). Engineering economy: the analysis of management decisions. Homewood, Ill.: R. D. Irwin.</ref> As a discipline, it is focused on the branch of economics known as [[microeconomics]] in that it studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of limited resources.<ref>Copied content from [[Microeconomics]]; see that page's history for attribution ...</ref> Thus, it focuses on the decision making process, its context and environment.<ref name=\"Dharmaraj2009\" /> It is pragmatic by nature, integrating economic theory with engineering practice. <ref name=\"Dharmaraj2009\" /> But, it is also a simplified application of micro-economic theory in that it avoids a number of micro-economic concepts such as price determination, competition and demand/supply. <ref name=\"Dharmaraj2009\" />  As a discipline though, it is closely related to others such as [[Statistics]], [[Mathematics]] and [[Cost Accounting]]. <ref name=\"Dharmaraj2009\" /> It draws upon the logical framework of economics but adds to that the analytical power of mathematics and statistics. <ref name=\"Dharmaraj2009\" /> <br>   \n[[Engineer]]s seek solutions to problems, and the economic viability of each potential solution is normally considered along with the technical aspects.\nFundamentally, engineering economics involves formulating, estimating, and evaluating the economic outcomes when alternatives to accomplish a defined purpose are available.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Optimal Switching Times for Season and Single Tickets''|url=http://ocw.metu.edu.tr/pluginfile.php/2193/mod_resource/content/0/LecturePresentation1.pdf|publisher=[[Middle East Technical University]]}}</ref>\n\nIn some U.S. undergraduate [[Civil engineering]] curricula, engineering economics is a required course.<ref>[https://www.uab.edu/engineering/home/departments-research/civil/undergraduate Undergraduate Programs Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering]. Retrieved 6 April 2015.</ref> It is a topic on the [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam]]ination, and questions might also be asked on the Principles and Practice of Engineering examination; both are part of the [[Professional Engineering]] registration process.\n\nConsidering the [[time value of money]] is central to most engineering economic analyses.  [[Cash flow]]s are [[Discounting|''discounted'']] using an [[interest rate]], i, except in the most basic economic studies.\n\nFor each problem, there are usually many possible ''alternatives''. One option that must be considered in each analysis, and is often the ''choice'', is the ''do nothing alternative''.  The ''opportunity cost'' of making one choice over another must also be considered.  There are also non-economic factors to be considered, like color, style, public image, etc.; such factors are termed ''attributes''.<ref>''Engineering Economy'', 11th Ed., Sullivan, Bontadelli, and Wicks, Prentice-Hall, New York, 2000</ref>\n\n''Costs'' as well as ''revenues'' are considered, for each alternative, for an ''analysis period'' that is either a fixed number of years or the estimated life of the project.  The ''salvage value'' is often forgotten, but is important, and is either the net cost or revenue for decommissioning the project.\n\nSome other topics that may be addressed in engineering economics are [[inflation]], [[uncertainty]], replacements, [[depreciation]], [[resource depletion]], [[taxes]], [[tax credits]], [[accounting]], cost estimations, or [[Capital (economics)|capital financing]]. All these topics are primary skills and knowledge areas in the field of [[cost engineering]].\n\nSince engineering is an important part of the [[manufacturing]] sector of the [[economy]], engineering industrial economics is an important part of industrial or business economics. Major topics in engineering industrial economics are:\n\n* The economics of the management, operation, and growth and profitability of engineering firms;\n* Macro-level engineering economic trends and issues;\n* Engineering product markets and demand influences; and\n* The development, marketing, and financing of new engineering technologies and products.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BE1v91Qlj64C&dq=isbn:090632128X Engineering Firms: A Survey Of Factors Affecting Their Growth & Performance]'', Industrial Systems Research Publications, Manchester (UK), 2nd.
