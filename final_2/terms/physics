The most notable work was ''[[Book of Optics|The Book of Optics]]'' (also known as Kit\u0101b al-Man\u0101\u1e93ir), written by Ibn Al-Haitham, in which he was not only the first to disprove the ancient Greek idea about vision, but also came up with a new theory. In the book, he was also the first to study the phenomenon of the [[pinhole camera]] and delved further into the way the eye itself works. Using dissections and the knowledge of previous scholars, he was able to begin to explain how light enters the eye, is focused, and is projected to the back of the eye: and built then the world's first [[camera obscura]] hundreds of years before the modern development of photography.<ref>{{harvnb|Howard|Rogers|1995|p=6-7}}</ref>\n[[File:Alhazen,_the_Persian.gif|thumb|Ibn Al Haitham, the pioneer of optics]]\n\nThe seven-volume ''Book of Optics'' (''Kitab al-Manathir'') hugely influenced thinking across disciplines from the theory of visual perception to the nature of perspective in medieval art, in both the East and the West, for more than 600 years. Many later European scholars and fellow polymaths, from [[Robert Grosseteste]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] to [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton]], were in his debt. Indeed, the influence of Ibn al-Haytham's Optics ranks alongside that of Newton's work of the same title, published 700 years later.\n\nThe translation of ''The Book of Optics'' had a huge impact on Europe. From it, later European scholars were able to build the same devices as what [[Alhazen|Ibn Al Haytham]] did, and understand the way light works.

Study of the philosophical issues surrounding physics, the philosophy of physics, involves issues such as the nature of [[space]] and [[time]], [[determinism]], and metaphysical outlooks such as [[empiricism]], [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]].<ref name=\"godfreysmith2003ch15\">{{harvnb|Godfrey-Smith|2003|loc=Chapter 15: \"Empiricism, Naturalism, and Scientific Realism?\"}}</ref>\n\nMany physicists have written about the philosophical implications of their work, for instance [[Laplace]], who championed [[causal determinism]],<ref name=\"laplace1951\">{{harvnb|Laplace|1951}}</ref> and [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]], who wrote on [[quantum mechanics]].<ref name=\"schroedinger1983\">{{harvnb|Schr\u00f6dinger|1983}}</ref><ref name=\"schroedinger1995\">{{harvnb|Schr\u00f6dinger|1995}}</ref> The mathematical physicist [[Roger Penrose]] has been called a [[Platonism|Platonist]] by [[Stephen Hawking]],<ref name=\"hawkingpenrose1996p4\">\"I think that Roger is a Platonist at heart but he must answer for himself.\" {{harv|Hawking|Penrose|1996|p=4}}</ref> a view Penrose discusses in his book, ''[[The Road to Reality]]''.<ref name=\"penrose2004\">{{harvnb|Penrose|2004}}</ref> Hawking refers to himself as an \"unashamed reductionist\" and takes issue with Penrose's views.<ref name=\"penroseshimonycartwrighthawking1997\">{{harvnb|Penrose|Shimony|Cartwright|Hawking|1997}}</ref>\n\n==Core theories==\n{{further information|Branches of physics|Outline of physics}}\nThough physics deals with a wide variety of systems, certain theories are used by all physicists. Each of these theories were experimentally tested numerous times and found to be an adequate approximation of nature. For instance, the theory of [[Classical physics|classical]] mechanics accurately describes the motion of objects, provided they are much larger than [[atom]]s and moving at much less than the [[speed of light]]. These theories continue to be areas of active research today. [[Chaos theory]], a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics was discovered in the 20th century, three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics by [[Isaac Newton]] (1642\u20131727).\n\nThese central theories are important tools for research into more specialised topics, and any physicist, regardless of their specialisation, is expected to be literate in them. These include [[classical mechanics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[thermodynamics]] and [[statistical mechanics]], [[electromagnetism]], and [[special relativity]].\n\n===Classical physics===\n{{Main article|Classical physics}}\n[[File:Prediction of sound scattering from Schroeder Diffuser.jpg|thumb|Classical physics implemented in an [[acoustic engineering]] model of sound reflecting from an acoustic diffuser]]\n\n[[Classical physics]] includes the traditional branches and topics that were recognised and well-developed before the beginning of the 20th century\u2014[[classical mechanics]], [[acoustics]], [[optics]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[electromagnetism]]. [[Classical mechanics]] is concerned with bodies acted on by [[force]]s and bodies in [[motion (physics)|motion]] and may be divided into [[statics]] (study of the forces on a body or bodies not subject to an acceleration), [[kinematics]] (study of motion without regard to its causes), and [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]] (study of motion and the forces that affect it); mechanics may also be divided into [[solid mechanics]] and [[fluid mechanics]] (known together as [[continuum mechanics]]), the latter include such branches as [[Fluid statics|hydrostatics]], [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamics]], [[aerodynamics]], and [[pneumatics]]. [[Acoustics]] is the study of how [[sound]] is produced, controlled, transmitted and received.<ref name=\"britannica-acoustics\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=acoustics |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/4044/acoustics |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |accessdate=14 June 2013 |ref=harv}}</ref>  Important modern branches of acoustics include [[ultrasonics]], the study of sound waves of very high frequency beyond the range of human hearing; [[bioacoustics]], the physics of animal calls and hearing,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bioacoustics.info/ |title=Bioacoustics \u2013 the International Journal of Animal Sound and its Recording |publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]] |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> and [[electroacoustics]], the manipulation of audible sound waves using electronics.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Acoustical Society of America]] |title=Acoustics and You (A Career in Acoustics?) |url=http://asaweb.devcloud.acquia-sites.com/education_outreach/careers_in_acoustics |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> \n\n[[Optics]], the study of [[light]], is concerned not only with [[visible light]] but also with [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet radiation]], which exhibit all of the phenomena of visible light except visibility, e.g., reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion, and polarization of light. [[Heat]] is a form of [[energy]], the internal energy possessed by the particles of which a substance is composed; thermodynamics deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy. [[Electricity]] and [[magnetism]] have been studied as a single branch of physics since the intimate connection between them was discovered in the early 19th century; an [[electric current]] gives rise to a [[magnetic field]], and a changing magnetic field induces an electric current. [[Electrostatics]] deals with [[electric charge]]s at rest, [[Classical electromagnetism|electrodynamics]] with moving charges, and [[magnetostatics]] with magnetic poles at rest.\n\n===Modern physics===\n{{Main article|Modern physics}}\n{{Modern Physics}}\n[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|left|[[Solvay Conference]] of 1927, with prominent physicists such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Max Planck]], [[Hendrik Lorentz]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[Marie Curie]], [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] and [[Paul Dirac]]]]\n\nClassical physics is generally concerned with matter and energy on the normal scale of observation, while much of modern physics is concerned with the behavior of matter and energy under extreme conditions or on a very large or very small scale. For example, [[Atomic physics|atomic]] and [[nuclear physics]] studies matter on the smallest scale at which [[chemical element]]s can be identified. The [[Particle physics|physics of elementary particles]] is on an even smaller scale since it is concerned with the most basic units of matter; this branch of physics is also known as high-energy physics because of the extremely high energies necessary to produce many types of particles in [[particle accelerator]]s. On this scale, ordinary, commonsense notions of space, time, matter, and energy are no longer valid.<ref>{{harvnb|Tipler|Llewellyn|2003|pp=269, 477, 561}}</ref>\n\nThe two chief theories of modern physics present a different picture of the concepts of space, time, and matter from that presented by classical physics. Classical mechanics approximates nature as continuous, while [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] is concerned with the discrete nature of many phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level and with the complementary aspects of particles and waves in the description of such phenomena. The [[theory of relativity]] is concerned with the description of phenomena that take place in a [[frame of reference]] that is in motion with respect to an observer; the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]] is concerned with relative uniform motion in a straight line and the [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]] with accelerated motion and its connection with [[gravitation]]. Both quantum theory and the theory of relativity find applications in all areas of modern physics.<ref>{{harvnb|Tipler|Llewellyn|2003|pp=1\u20134, 115, 185\u2013187}}</ref>\n\n===Difference between classical and modern physics===\n[[File:Modernphysicsfields.svg|thumb|350px|left|The basic domains of physics]]\n\nWhile physics aims to discover universal laws, its theories lie in explicit domains of applicability. Loosely speaking, the laws of [[classical physics]] accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light. Outside of this domain, observations do not match predictions provided by classical mechanics. [[Albert Einstein]] contributed the framework of [[special relativity]], which replaced notions of [[absolute time and space]] with [[spacetime]] and allowed an accurate description of systems whose components have speeds approaching the speed of light. [[Max Planck]], [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]], and others introduced [[quantum mechanics]], a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions that allowed an accurate description of atomic and subatomic scales. Later, [[quantum field theory]] unified [[quantum mechanics]] and [[special relativity]]. [[General relativity]] allowed for a dynamical, curved [[spacetime]], with which highly massive systems and the large-scale structure of the universe can be well-described. General relativity has not yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions; several candidate theories of [[quantum gravity]] are being developed.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Relation to other fields==\n[[File:Pahoeoe fountain original.jpg|thumb|This [[parabola]]-shaped [[lava flow]] illustrates the application of mathematics in physics\u2014in this case, [[Galileo]]'s [[law of falling bodies]].]]\n[[File:Physics and other sciences.png|thumb|left|Mathematics and ontology are used in physics.

Thus physics statements are synthetic, while mathematical statements are analytic. Mathematics contains hypotheses, while physics contains theories. Mathematics statements have to be only logically true, while predictions of physics statements must match observed and experimental data.\n\nThe distinction is clear-cut, but not always obvious. For example, mathematical physics is the application of mathematics in physics. Its methods are mathematical, but its subject is physical.<ref name=\"jmp-def\">{{cite web | url=http://www.researchgate.net/journal/0022-2488_Journal_of_Mathematical_Physics | title=Journal of Mathematical Physics | publisher=[[ResearchGate]] | accessdate=31 March 2014|quote=mathematical physics \u2014 that is, the application of mathematics to problems in physics and the development of mathematical methods suitable for such applications and for the formulation of physical theories.}}</ref> The problems in this field start with a \"[[Boundary condition|mathematical model of a physical situation]]\" (system) and a \"mathematical description of a physical law\" that will be applied to that system. Every mathematical statement used for solving has a hard-to-find physical meaning. The final mathematical solution has an easier-to-find meaning, because it is what the solver is looking for.{{clarify|date=August 2015}}\n\nPhysics is a branch of [[fundamental science]], not [[practical science]]. Physics is also called \"the fundamental science\" because the subject of study of all branches of [[natural science]] like chemistry, astronomy, geology, and biology are constrained by laws of physics,<ref name=\"feynmanleightonsands1963v1ch3\">{{harvnb|Feynman|Leighton|Sands|1963|loc=Chapter 3: \"The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences\"}}; see also [[reductionism]] and [[special sciences]]</ref> similar to how chemistry is often called [[the central science]] because of its role in linking the physical sciences. For example, chemistry studies properties, structures, and [[chemical reaction|reactions]] of matter (chemistry's focus on the atomic scale [[Difference between chemistry and physics|distinguishes it from physics]]). Structures are formed because particles exert electrical forces on each other, properties include physical characteristics of given substances, and reactions are bound by laws of physics, like conservation of energy, mass, and charge.\n\nPhysics is applied in industries like engineering and medicine.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Application and influence===\n{{Main article|Applied physics}}\n[[File:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated small.gif|thumb|150px|[[Archimedes' screw]], a [[simple machine]] for lifting]]\n[[File:IMG 1729 Gemaal met schroef van Archimedes bij Kinderdijk.JPG|thumb|150px|The application of physical laws in lifting liquids]]\n\n[[Applied physics]] is a general term for physics research which is intended for a particular [[Utility|use]]. An applied physics [[curriculum]] usually contains a few classes in an applied discipline, like geology or electrical engineering. It usually differs from [[engineering]] in that an applied physicist may not be designing something in particular, but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving a problem.\n\nThe approach is similar to that of [[applied mathematics]]. Applied physicists use physics in scientific research. For instance, people working on [[accelerator physics]] might seek to build better [[particle detector]]s for research in theoretical physics.\n\nPhysics is used heavily in [[engineering]]. For example, [[statics]], a subfield of [[mechanics]], is used in the building of [[bridge]]s and other static structures. The understanding and use of [[acoustics]] results in sound control and better concert halls; similarly, the use of [[optics]] creates better optical devices. An understanding of physics makes for more realistic [[flight simulator]]s, [[video game]]s, and [[Film|movies]], and is often critical in [[forensic]] investigations.\n\nWith the [[Uniformitarianism (science)|standard consensus]] that the [[Scientific law|laws]] of physics are universal and do not change with time, physics can be used to study things that would ordinarily be mired in [[uncertainty]]. For example, in the [[History of Earth#Origin of the Earth's core and first atmosphere|study of the origin of the earth]], one can reasonably model earth's [[mass]], [[temperature]], and rate of [[rotation]], as a function of time allowing one to extrapolate forward or backward in time and so predict future or prior events. It also allows for simulations in engineering which drastically speed up the development of a new technology.\n\nBut there is also considerable [[interdisciplinarity]] in the physicist's methods, so many other important fields are influenced by physics (e.g., the fields of [[econophysics]] and sociophysics).\n\n==Research==\n\n===Scientific method===\nPhysicists use [[scientific method|the scientific method]] to test the validity of a [[physical theory]]. By using a methodical approach to compare the implications of a theory with the conclusions drawn from its related [[experiment]]s and observations, physicists are better able to test the validity of a theory in a logical, unbiased, and repeatable way. To that end, experiments are performed and observations are made in order to determine the validity or invalidity of the theory.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ellis |first1=G. |last2=Silk |first2=J. |title=Scientific method: Defend the integrity of physics |url=http://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-defend-the-integrity-of-physics-1.16535 |journal=Nature |date=16 December 2014 |volume=516 |issue=7531 |pages=321\u2013323 |doi=10.1038/516321a|bibcode=2014Natur.516..321E }}</ref>\n\nA [[scientific law]] is a concise verbal or mathematical statement of a relation which expresses a fundamental principle of some theory, such as Newton's law of universal gravitation.<ref name=\"honderich1995pp474-476\">{{harvnb|Honderich|1995|pp=474\u2013476}}</ref>\n\n===Theory and experiment===\n{{Main article|Theoretical physics|Experimental physics}}\n[[File:Astronaut-EVA.jpg|thumb|right|The [[astronaut]] and [[Earth]] are both in [[free-fall]]]]\n[[File:Lightning in Arlington.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lightning]] is an [[electric current]]]]\n\nTheorists seek to develop [[mathematical model]]s that both agree with existing experiments and successfully predict future experimental results, while [[experimentalist]]s devise and perform experiments to test theoretical predictions and explore new phenomena.

Theorists invoke these ideas in hopes of solving particular problems with existing theories. They then explore the consequences of these ideas and work toward making testable predictions.\n\n[[Experiment]]al physics expands, and is expanded by, [[engineering]] and [[technology]]. Experimental physicists involved in [[basic research]] design and perform experiments with equipment such as [[particle accelerator]]s and [[laser]]s, whereas those involved in [[applied research]] often work in industry developing technologies such as [[MRI|magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)]] and [[transistor]]s. [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]] has noted that experimentalists may seek areas which are not well-explored by theorists.<ref name=\"feynman1965p157-experiment\">\"In fact experimenters have a certain individual character.

Here, the path of a particle is modeled with the mathematics of [[calculus]] to explain its behavior: the purview of the branch of physics known as [[mechanics]].]]\n\nPhysics covers a wide range of [[phenomenon|phenomena]], from [[elementary particle]]s (such as quarks, neutrinos, and electrons) to the largest [[superclusters]] of galaxies. Included in these phenomena are the most basic objects composing all other things. Therefore, physics is sometimes called the \"[[fundamental science]]\".<ref name=\"feynmanleightonsands1963v1ch3\" /> Physics aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena. Thus, physics aims to both connect the things observable to humans to [[root cause]]s, and then connect these causes together.\n\nFor example, the [[History of China|ancient Chinese]] observed that certain rocks ([[lodestone]] and [[magnetite]]) were attracted to one another by an invisible force. This effect was later called [[magnetism]], which was first rigorously studied in the 17th century. But even before the Chinese discovered magnetism, the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] knew of other objects such as [[amber]], that when rubbed with fur would cause a similar invisible attraction between the two.<ref name=stewart>{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=J. |year=2001 |title=Intermediate Electromagnetic Theory |page=50 |publisher=[[World Scientific]] |isbn=981-02-4471-1}}</ref> This was also first studied rigorously in the 17th century and came to be called [[electricity]]. Thus, physics had come to understand two observations of nature in terms of some root cause (electricity and magnetism). However, further work in the 19th century revealed that these two forces were just two different aspects of one force\u2014[[electromagnetism]]. This process of \"unifying\" forces continues today, and electromagnetism and the [[weak nuclear force]] are now considered to be two aspects of the [[electroweak interaction]]. Physics hopes to find an ultimate reason ([[Theory of Everything]]) for why nature is as it is (see section ''[[#Current research|Current research]]'' below for more information).<ref>{{cite book |last=Weinberg |first=S. |year=1993 |title=Dreams of a Final Theory: The Search for the Fundamental Laws of Nature |publisher=[[Hutchinson Radius]] |isbn=0-09-177395-4}}</ref>\n\n===Research fields===\nContemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into [[particle physics]]; [[condensed matter physics]]; [[atomic, molecular, and optical physics]]; [[astrophysics]]; and [[applied physics]].
