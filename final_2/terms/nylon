Mixtures of these can be polymerized together to make copolymers. Nylon polymers can be mixed with a wide variety of additives to achieve many different property variations.\n\nNylon was intended to be a synthetic replacement for [[silk]] and substituted for it in many different products after silk became scarce during [[World War II]]. It replaced silk in military applications such as [[parachute]]s and [[Flak jacket|flak vests]], and was used in many types of vehicle tires.<ref name=Wolfe2008/>\n\nAfter initial commercialization of nylon as a fiber, applications in the form of shapes and films were also developed. The main market for nylon shapes now is in auto components, but there are many others.\n\n==Chemistry==\nNylons are [[condensation polymer|condensation copolymers]], formed by reacting difunctional monomers containing equal parts of [[amine]] and [[carboxylic acid]], so that [[amide]]s are formed at both ends of each monomer in a process analogous to [[polypeptide]] [[biopolymer]]s. Most nylons are made from the reaction of a [[dicarboxylic acid]] with a [[diamine]] (e.g. PA66) or a [[lactam]] or amino acid with itself (e.g. PA6).  In the first case, the structure is so-called ABAB similar to [[polyester]]s and [[polyurethane]]s: the \"repeating unit\" consists of one of each monomer, so that they alternate in the chain. Since each monomer in this copolymer has the same [[chemical reaction|reactive group]] on both ends, the direction of the [[peptide bond|amide bond]] reverses between each monomer, unlike natural [[polyamide]] [[protein]]s, which have overall directionality: [[carboxyl|C&nbsp;terminal]]&nbsp;\u2192 [[amino|N&nbsp;terminal]]. In the second case (so called AA), the repeating unit corresponds to the single monomer.\n\nIt is difficult to get the proportions exactly correct, and deviations can lead to chain termination at molecular weights less than a desirable 10,000 [[atomic mass unit|daltons]] ([[unified atomic mass unit|u]]). To overcome this problem, a [[crystal]]line, solid \"nylon [[salt]]\" can be formed at [[room temperature]], using an exact 1:1 [[ratio]] of the [[acid]] and the [[Base (chemistry)|base]] to neutralize each other. The salt is crystallized to purify it and obtain the desired precise stoichiometry.  Heated to 285&nbsp;\u00b0C (545&nbsp;\u00b0F), the salt reacts to form nylon polymer with the production of water.\n\n[[Wallace Carothers]] at DuPont patented<ref>[http://www.caimateriali.org/index.php?id=32 History of Nylon] US Patent 2,130,523 'Linear polyamides suitable for spinning into strong pliable fibers', U.S. Patent 2,130,947 'Diamine dicarboxylic acid salt' and U.S. Patent 2,130,948 'Synthetic fibers', all issued September 20, 1938</ref> nylon&nbsp;66, but overlooked the possibility to use lactams.  That synthetic route was developed by [[Paul Schlack]] at [[IG Farben]], leading to [[nylon 6|nylon&nbsp;6]], or [[caprolactam|polycaprolactam]] \u2014 formed by a [[ring-opening polymerization]]. The peptide bond within the caprolactam is broken with the exposed [[chemical reaction|active groups]] on each side being incorporated into two new bonds as the monomer becomes part of the polymer backbone.\n\nThe 428&nbsp;\u00b0F (220&nbsp;\u00b0C) melting point of nylon 6 is lower than the 509&nbsp;\u00b0F (265&nbsp;\u00b0C) melting point of nylon 66.<ref>\nTypical physical characteristics of nylon at [http://machinedesign.com/BDE/materials/bdemat2/bdemat2_29.html \"Basics of Design Engineering\"]</ref>\n\nNylon&nbsp;510, made from [[pentamethylene diamine]] and [[sebacic acid]], was studied by Carothers even before nylon&nbsp;66 and has superior properties, but is more expensive to make. In keeping with this naming convention, \"nylon&nbsp;6,12\" or \"PA 612\" is a copolymer of a 6C diamine and a 12C diacid. Similarly for PA 510 PA 611; PA 1012, etc. Other nylons include copolymerized dicarboxylic acid/diamine products that are ''not'' based upon the monomers listed above. For example, some fully [[aromatic]] nylons (known as \"[[aramids]]\") are polymerized with the addition of diacids like [[terephthalic acid]] (\u2192 [[Kevlar]], [[Twaron]]) or [[isophthalic acid]] (\u2192 [[Nomex]]), more commonly associated with polyesters. There are copolymers of PA 66/6; copolymers of PA 66/6/12; and others. In general linear polymers are the most useful, but it is possible to introduce branches in nylon by the condensation of dicarboxylic acids with [[polyamine]]s having three or more [[amino group]]s.\n\nThe general reaction is:\n[[Image:Condensation polymerization diacid diamine.svg|centre|600px]]\n\nTwo molecules of [[water (molecule)|water]] are given off and the nylon is formed. Its properties are determined by the R and R' groups in the monomers. In nylon 6,6, R&nbsp;=&nbsp;4C and R'&nbsp;=&nbsp;6C [[alkane]]s, but one also has to include the two carboxyl [[carbons]] in the diacid to get the number it donates to the chain. In [[Kevlar]], both R and R' are [[benzene]] rings.\n\nIndustrial synthesis is usually done by heating the acids, amines or lactams to remove water, but in the laboratory, diacid chlorides can be reacted with diamines. For example, a popular demonstration of interfacial polymerization (the \"[[nylon rope trick]]\") is the synthesis of [[nylon 66]] from [[adipoyl chloride]] and hexamethylene diamine\n\n===Nomenclature===\nThe nomenclature used for nylon polymers was devised during the synthesis of the first simple aliphatic nylons and uses numbers to describe the number of carbons between acid and amine functions (including the carbon of the carboxylic acid). Subsequent use  of  cyclic and aromatic monomers required the use of letters or sets of letters. One number after \"PA\" for a homopolymer based on one monomer, and two numbers or sets of letters where there are two monomers. For copolymers the comonomers or pairs of comonomers are separated by slashes, as shown in the examples below.\n\n* [[homopolymer]]s : \n** PA 6 : [NH\u2212(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>\u2212CO]<sub>n</sub> made from \u03b5-[[Caprolactam]] ;\n** PA 66 : [NH\u2212(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>\u2212NH\u2212CO\u2212(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>\u2212CO]<sub>n</sub> made from [[hexamethylenediamine]] and [[adipic acid]];\n* [[copolymer]]s : \n** PA 6/66 : [NH-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>\u2212NH\u2212CO\u2212(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>\u2212CO]<sub>n</sub>\u2212[NH\u2212(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>\u2212CO]<sub>m</sub> made from caprolactam, hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid ;\n** PA 66/610 : [NH\u2212(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>\u2212NH\u2212CO\u2212(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>\u2212CO]<sub>n</sub>\u2212[NH\u2212(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>\u2212NH\u2212CO\u2212(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>8</sub>\u2212CO]<sub>m</sub> made from hexamethylenediamine, adipic acid and [[sebacic acid]].\n\nIn common usage, the prefix 'PA' or the name 'Nylon' are used interchangeably and are equivalent in meaning.\n\nThe term [[polyphthalamide]] (abbreviated to PPA) is used when 60% or more moles of the carboxylic acid portion of the repeating unit in the polymer chain is composed of a combination of terephthalic (TPA) and isophthalic (IPA) acids\n\n===Monomers===\nNylon monomers are manufactured by a variety of routes, starting in most cases from crude oil but sometimes from biomass.

The 1967 Accident of the [[Apollo 1]] Command Module was caused by an electrical short which created a fire that quickly consumed the interior of the cabin due to the pure [[oxygen]] environment and excessive amounts of flammable materials on board, most of which were nylons and [[Velcro]].\n\n==Bulk properties==\nAbove their [[glass transition temperature|melting temperatures]], ''T''<sub>m</sub>, [[thermoplastic]]s like nylon are [[amorphous solid]]s or viscous [[fluid]]s in which the chains approximate [[random coil]]s. Below ''T''<sub>m</sub>, amorphous regions alternate with regions which are [[lamellae (materials)|lamellar]] [[crystal]]s.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041230231859/http://www.aml.arizona.edu/classes/mse222/1998/nylon66/mse222.htm Valerie Menzer's Nylon 66 Webpage]. Arizona University</ref> The amorphous regions contribute elasticity and the crystalline regions contribute strength and rigidity. The [[Plane (geometry)|planar]] amide (-CO-NH-) groups are very [[chemical polarity|polar]], so nylon forms multiple [[hydrogen bond]]s among adjacent strands. Because the nylon backbone is so regular and symmetrical, especially if all the amide bonds are in the [[geometric isomerism|''trans'' configuration]], nylons often have high crystallinity and make excellent fibers. The amount of crystallinity depends on the details of formation, as well as on the kind of nylon. Apparently it can never be [[quench]]ed from a [[melt (manufacturing)|melt]] as a completely amorphous solid.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n[[File:Nylon-3D-h bond.png|thumb|316px|Hydrogen bonding in Nylon&nbsp;6,6 (in mauve).]]\n\nNylon&nbsp;66 can have multiple parallel strands aligned with their neighboring peptide bonds at coordinated separations of exactly 6 and 4 carbons for considerable lengths, so the [[carbonyl]] [[oxygen]]s and amide [[hydrogen]]s can line up to form interchain [[hydrogen bond]]s repeatedly, without interruption (see the figure opposite). Nylon&nbsp;510 can have coordinated runs of 5 and 8 carbons. Thus parallel (but not antiparallel) strands can participate in extended, unbroken, multi-chain [[beta sheet|\u03b2-pleated sheets]], a strong and tough supermolecular structure similar to that found in natural [[keratin#Molecular biology and biochemistry|silk fibroin]] and the [[keratin|\u03b2-keratins]] in [[feather]]s. (Proteins have only an amino acid \u03b1-carbon separating sequential -CO-NH- groups.) Nylon&nbsp;6 will form uninterrupted [[hydrogen bond|H-bonded]] sheets with mixed directionalities, but the \u03b2-sheet wrinkling is somewhat different. The three-dimensional disposition of each [[alkane]] [[hydrocarbon chain]] depends on [[rotation]]s about the 109.47\u00b0 [[alkane#Molecular geometry|tetrahedral]] bonds of singly bonded carbon atoms.\n\nWhen [[extrusion|extruded]] into fibers through pores in an industry [[Spinneret (polymers)|spinneret]], the individual polymer chains tend to align because of [[viscosity|viscous]] [[rheology|flow]]. If subjected to [[cold drawing]] afterwards, the fibers align further, increasing their crystallinity, and the material acquires additional [[tensile strength]]. In practice, nylon fibers are most often drawn using heated rolls at high speeds.<ref name=Campbell>{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Ian M.|title=Introduction to synthetic polymers|date=2000|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198564708}}</ref>\n\nBlock nylon tends to be less crystalline, except near the surfaces due to [[Shear (fluid)|shearing]] [[stress (physics)|stresses]] during formation. Nylon is clear and [[color]]less, or milky, but is easily [[dye]]d. Multistranded nylon cord and rope is slippery and tends to unravel. The ends can be [[melting|melted]] and fused with a heat source such as a [[flame]] or [[electrode]] to prevent this.\n\nNylons are hygroscopic, and will absorb or desorb moisture as a function of the ambient humidity. Variations in moisture content have several effects on the polymer.  Firstly, the dimensions will change, but more importantly moisture acts as a plasticizer, lowering the [[glass transition temperature]] (''T''<sub>g</sub>), and consequently the elastic modulus at temperatures below the ''T''<sub>g</sub> <ref>http://www.tainstruments.co.jp/application/pdf/Thermal_Library/Applications_Briefs/TA133.PDF Measurement of Moisture Effects on the Mechanical Properties of 66 Nylon - TA Instruments Thermal Analysis Application Brief TA-133</ref>\n\nWhen dry, polyamide is a good electrical insulator. However, polyamide is [[hygroscopic]]. The absorption of water will change some of the material's properties such as its [[electrical resistance]]. Nylon is less absorbent than wool or cotton.\n\n===Characteristics===\n\nThe characteristic features of nylon 6,6 include:\n*Pleats and creases can be heat-set at higher temperatures\n*More compact molecular structure\n*Better weathering properties; better sunlight resistance\n*Softer \"Hand\"\n*High melting point (256&nbsp;\u00b0C/492.8&nbsp;\u00b0F)\n*Superior colorfastness\n*Excellent abrasion resistance\n\nOn the other hand, nylon 6 is easy to dye, more readily fades; it has a higher impact resistance, a more rapid moisture absorption, greater elasticity and elastic recovery.\n*Variation of luster: nylon has the ability to be very lustrous, semilustrous or dull.\n*Durability: its high tenacity fibers are used for seatbelts, tire cords, ballistic cloth and other uses.\n*High elongation\n*Excellent abrasion resistance\n*Highly resilient (nylon fabrics are heat-set)\n*Paved the way for easy-care garments\n*High resistance to insects, fungi, animals, as well as molds, mildew, rot and many chemicals\n*Used in carpets and nylon stockings\n*Melts instead of burning\n*Used in many military applications\n*Good [[specific strength]]\n*Transparent to infrared light (\u221212&nbsp;dB)<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1771814|title=Millimeter-wave, terahertz, and mid-infrared transmission through common clothing|year=2004|last1=Bjarnason|first1=J.

It was also used to make [[tire]]s, [[tent]]s, [[rope]]s, [[poncho]]s, and other [[armed forces|military]] supplies. It was even used in the production of a high-grade paper for U.S. [[currency]]. At the outset of the war, [[cotton]] accounted for more than 80% of all fibers used and manufactured, and [[wool]] fibers accounted for nearly all of the rest. By August 1945, manufactured fibers had taken a market share of 25%, at the expense of cotton. After the war, because of shortages of both silk and nylon, nylon parachute material was sometimes repurposed to make dresses.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Caruso|first=David|title=Saving the (Wedding) Day: Oral History Spotlight|journal=Transmutations|year=2009|volume=Fall|issue=5|pages=2|url=http://www.chemheritage.org/Downloads/Publications/Transmutations/05-Transmutations_Fall-2009.pdf|accessdate=24 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nNylon 6 and 66 fibers are used in [[Carpet#Nylon|carpet]] manufacture.\n\nNylon is one kind of fiber used in [[Tire#Materials|tire cord]].\n\n===Shapes===\nNylon resins are widely used in the automobile industry especially in the engine compartment.<ref>http://www.materialdatacenter.com/mb/main/pdf/application/16449 Nylon Oil Pan</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Kohan|first1=Melvin|title=Nylon Plastics Handbook|date=1995|publisher=Carl Hanser Verlag|location=Munich|isbn=1569901899|page=514}}</ref>\n\nSolid nylon is used in hair combs and [[machine|mechanical]] parts such as [[machine screw]]s, [[gear]]s and other low- to medium-stress components previously cast in metal.<ref name=Youssef>{{cite book|last1=Youssef|first1=Helmi A.|last2=El-Hofy,|first2=Hassan A.|last3=Ahmed|first3=Mahmoud H.|title=Manufacturing technology : materials, processes, and equipment|date=2011|publisher=Taylor & Francis/CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=9781439810859|page=350|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KGbNBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA350}}</ref> Engineering-grade nylon is processed by [[extrusion]], [[casting]], and [[injection molding]].

A month later, the General presented Segovia with some nylon strings which he had obtained via some members of the DuPont family. Segovia found that although the strings produced a clear sound, they had a faint metallic [[timbre]] which he hoped could be eliminated.<ref name=Guitar>{{cite web|title=The History of Classical guitar strings|url=http://www.maestros-of-the-guitar.com/classicalguitarstrings.html|website=Maestros of the Guitar|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nNylon strings were first tried on stage by Olga Coelho in New York in January, 1944.<ref>Bellow, Alexander (1970). ''The Illustrated History of the Guitar''. New York: Belwin-Mills. p. 193.</ref>\n\nIn 1946, Segovia and string maker [[Albert Augustine Ltd.|Albert Augustine]] were introduced by their mutual friend Vladimir Bobri, editor of Guitar Review. On the basis of Segovia's interest and Augustine's past experiments, they decided to pursue the development of nylon strings. DuPont, skeptical of the idea, agreed to supply the nylon if Augustine would endeavor to develop and produce the actual strings. After three years of development, Augustine demonstrated a nylon first string whose quality impressed guitarists, including Segovia, in addition to DuPont.<ref name=Guitar/>\n\nWound strings, however, were more problematic. Eventually, however, after experimenting with various types of metal and smoothing and polishing techniques, Augustine was also able to produce high quality nylon wound strings.<ref name=Guitar/>\n\n====Duralon====\nDuralon is an alternate and trademarked (by [[Rexnord]]) name for a composite of Teflon/ Dacron with a [[fiberglass]] substrate that has an [[epoxy]] resin as the binding agent.  It is known for its extremely low friction and high resistance to corrosion and to temperatures up to {{convert|325|F|C}}.  It is often described as \"ceramic\" by virtue of its fiberglass content, which helps it endure higher temperatures while remaining low-friction and resistant to physical damage.  Duralon is used as a coating in many items of cookware, though its long-term ability to remain \"stick-free\" appears to be in some doubt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fabco-air.com/tech_info/techpage.htm|title=What is Duralon?|publisher=Fabco Air|date=2014}}</ref>\n\n==Hydrolysis and degradation==\nAll nylons are susceptible to [[hydrolysis]], especially by [[strong acid]]s, a reaction essentially the reverse of the synthetic reaction shown above. The [[molecular weight]] of nylon products so attacked drops, and cracks form quickly at the affected zones. Lower members of the nylons (such as nylon 6) are affected more than higher members such as nylon 12. This means that nylon parts cannot be used in contact with [[sulfuric acid]] for example, such as the electrolyte used in [[Lead\u2013acid battery|lead\u2013acid batteries]].\n\nWhen being molded, nylon must be dried to prevent hydrolysis in the molding machine barrel since water at high temperatures can also degrade the polymer.<ref name=Reltek>{{cite web|title=Adhesive for nylon & kevlar|url=http://reltekllc.com/adhesivesfornylon.aspx|website=Reltek|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref> The reaction is of the type:\n:[[Image:amide hydrolysis.svg]]\n\n==Environmental impact, incineration and recycling==\n\nBerners-Lee reckons the average [[GHG footprint|greenhouse gas footprint]] of nylon in manufacturing carpets at 5.43&nbsp;kg CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per kg, when produced in Europe. This gives it almost the same carbon footprint as [[wool]], but with greater durability and therefore a lower overall carbon footprint.<ref>Berners-Lee, Mike  (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=zs13m5JquBwC& ''How Bad are Bananas? The Carbon Footprint of Everything'']. London: Profile, p. 112 (table 6.1).</ref>\n\nData published by PlasticsEurope indicates for nylon 66 a [[GHG footprint|greenhouse gas footprint]] of 6.4&nbsp;kg CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per kg, and an energy consumption of 138 kJ/kg.<ref>{{cite book|title=Eco-profiles and Environmental Product Declarations of the European Plastics Manufacturers: Polyamide 6.6|date=2014|publisher=PlasticsEurope AISBL|location=Brussels|url=http://www.plasticseurope.org/plasticssustainability/eco-profiles/browse-by-flowchart.aspx?LCAID=r307}}</ref>  When considering the environmental impact of nylon, it is important to consider the use phase.  In particular when cars are lightweighted, significant savings in fuel consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are reduced.\n\nVarious nylons break down in fire and form hazardous smoke, and toxic fumes or ash, typically containing [[hydrogen cyanide]]. [[Incineration|Incinerating]] nylons to recover the high energy used to create them is usually expensive, so most nylons reach the garbage dumps, decaying very slowly.<ref>Typically 80 to 100% is sent to landfill or garbage dumps, while less than 18% are incinerated while recovering the energy.

Much nylon resin is recycled directly in a closed loop at the injection molding machine, by grinding sprues and runners and mixing them with the virgin granules being consumed by the molding machine.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Boydell|first1=P|last2=Bradfield|first2=C|last3=von Falkenhausen|first3=V|last4=Prautzsch|first4=G|title=Recycling of Waste from Glass-reinforced nylon resins|journal=Engineering Design|date=1995|volume=2|pages=8\u201310}}</ref>\n\n==Current market and forecast==\nAs one of the largest engineering polymer families, the global demand of nylon resins and compounds was valued at roughly US$20.5 billion in 2013. The market is expected to reach US$30 billion by 2020 by following an average annual growth of 5.5%.<ref>{{cite web | title = Market Report: Global Polyamide Market | publisher = Acmite Market Intelligence | url = http://www.acmite.com/market-reports/chemicals/global-polyamide-market.html}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nIn 1940, John W. Eckelberry of DuPont stated that the letters \"nyl\" were arbitrary and the \"on\" was copied from the suffixes of other fibers such as [[cotton]] and [[rayon]]. A later publication by DuPont (''Context'', vol.&nbsp;7, no.&nbsp;2, 1978) explained that the name was originally intended to be \"No-Run\" (\"run\" meaning \"unravel\"), but was modified to avoid making such an unjustified claim. Since the products were not really run-proof, the vowels were swapped to produce \"nuron\", which was changed to \"nilon\" \"to make it sound less like a nerve tonic\". For clarity in pronunciation, the \"i\" was changed to \"y\".<ref name=Wolfe2008/><ref>{{cite book|last=Algeo|first=John|authorlink=John Algeo|title=The Origins and Development of the English Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=znFmBZ2D8rEC&pg=PA224|volume=6|year=2009|publisher=Cengage|isbn=9781428231450|page=224}}</ref>\n\nAn alternative but apocryphal explanation for the name is that it is a combination of New York and London: NY-Lon.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|3}}\n*[[Aramid]]\n*[[Forensic engineering]]\n*[[Polymer]]s\n*[[Plastic#Nylon|Plastic]]\n*[[Nylon 6]]\n*[[Nylon 66]]\n*[[Ballistic nylon]]\n*[[Ripstop nylon|Rip-stop nylon]]\n*[[Cordura]]\n*[[Qiana]]\n*[[Nylon riots]]\n*[[Step-growth polymerization]]\n*[[Nylon-eating bacteria]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''Textiles'' by Sara J.
