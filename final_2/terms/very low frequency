The band is also known as the '''myriametre band''' or '''myriametre wave''' as the wavelengths range from one to ten [[myriametre]]s (an obsolete metric unit equal to 10 kilometres).  Due to its limited [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], [[Audio signal|audio]] (voice) transmission is highly impractical, and therefore, only low [[Data signaling rate|data rate]] coded signals are used.  The VLF band is used for a few [[radio navigation]] services, government [[Time signal|time radio stations]] (broadcasting time signals to set [[radio clock]]s) and for secure military communication.  Since VLF waves can penetrate at least 40 meters (120&nbsp;ft) into saltwater, they are used for military communication with submarines.\n\n==Propagation characteristics==\nBecause of their large wavelengths, VLF radio waves can [[Diffraction|diffract]] around large obstacles and so are not blocked by mountain ranges, and can propagate as [[ground wave]]s following the curvature of the Earth.  The main mode of long distance propagation is an [[Earth-ionosphere waveguide]] mechanism.<ref name=\"Hunsucker\">{{cite book\n  | last = Hunsucker\n  | first = R.

The conductive ionosphere and the conductive Earth, form a horizontal \"duct\" a few VLF wavelengths high, which acts as a [[waveguide]] confining the waves so they don't escape into space.  The waves travel in a zigzag path around the Earth, reflected alternately by the Earth and the ionosphere, in TM ([[transverse magnetic]]) mode.\n\nVLF waves have very low path attenuation, 2-3&nbsp;dB per 1000&nbsp;km,<ref name=\"Hunsucker\" /> with little of the \"[[fading]]\" experienced at higher frequencies,<ref name=\"Ghosh\" />  This is because  VLF waves are reflected from the bottom of the ionosphere, while higher frequency shortwave signals are returned to Earth from higher layers in the ionosphere, the [[F1 layer|F1]] and [[F2 layer|F2]] layers, by a refraction process, and spend most of their journey in the ionosphere, so they are much more affected by ionization gradients and turbulence.   Therefore, VLF transmissions are very stable and reliable, and are used for long distance communication.  Propagation distances of 5000 to 20000&nbsp;km have been realized.<ref name=\"Hunsucker\" />  However, atmospheric noise ([[sferics]]) is high in the band,<ref name=\"Ghosh\" /> including such phenomena as \"[[whistler (radio)|whistler]]s\", caused by [[lightning]].\n\nVLF waves can penetrate [[seawater]] to a depth of at least 10 to 40 meters (30 to 130 feet), depending on the frequency employed and the salinity of the water, so they are used to communicate with submarines.\n\nVLF waves at certain frequencies have been found to cause [[Electron precipitation|electron precipitation (TIPER)]].\n\n==Antennas==\n[[File:Cutler VLF antenna array.png|thumb|upright=1.5|\"Trideco\" antenna tower array at the US Navy's [[VLF Transmitter Cutler|Naval Radio Station Cutler]] in Cutler, Maine, USA. The central mast is the radiating element, while the star-shaped horizontal wire array is the capacitive top load.  About 1.2 miles in diameter, it communicates with submerged submarines at 24&nbsp;kHz at a power of 1.8&nbsp;megawatts, the most powerful radio station in the world.]]\n[[File:Jim Creek VLF antenna.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Another type of large VLF antenna: the \"valley-span\" antenna, consisting of multiple horizontal topload cables spanning a valley, fed in the center by vertical radiators.  This example is at the US Navy [[Jim Creek Naval Radio Station|Jim Creek station]] near [[Seattle]], which transmits on 24.8&nbsp;kHz at a power of 1.2&nbsp;MW. ]]\n\nA major practical drawback to this band is that because of the length of the waves, full size resonant antennas ([[half wave dipole]] or [[monopole antenna|quarter wave monopole]] antennas) cannot be built because of their physical height.  Vertical antennas must be used because VLF waves propagate in vertical polarization, but a quarter-wave vertical antenna at 30&nbsp;kHz would be 2.5 kilometers high. So practical transmitting antennas are [[electrical length|electrically short]], a small fraction of a wavelength long.  Due to their low [[radiation resistance]] they are inefficient, radiating only 10% to 50% of the transmitter power at most.<ref name=\"Hunsucker\" />  with the rest of the power dissipated in the antenna/ground system resistances.  Very high power transmitters (~1 megawatt) are required to radiate enough power for long distance communication.\n\nTransmitting antennas for VLF frequencies are very large wire antennas, up to a mile across.  They consist of a series of steel [[radio mast]]s, linked at the top with a network of cables, often shaped like an umbrella or clotheslines.  Either the towers themselves or vertical wires serve as [[monopole antenna|monopole]] radiators, and the horizontal cables form a capacitive top-load to increase the efficiency of the antenna.   High power stations use variations on the [[umbrella antenna]] such as the \"delta\" and \"trideco\" antennas, or [[T-aerial|multiply-tuned flattop]] (triatic) antennas.  For low power transmitters, inverted-L and [[T-aerial|T antennas]] are used.  A large [[loading coil]] is required at the antenna feed point to cancel the capacitive reactance of the antenna to make it resonant.\n\nTo minimize power dissipated in the ground, these antennas require extremely low resistance ground systems.  Because of soil resistance, [[Counterpoise (ground system)|counterpoise]] systems are often used, consisting of radial networks of copper cables supported several feet above the ground under the antenna, extending out radially from the mast or vertical element.\n\nThe high capacitance and inductance and low resistance of the antenna-loading coil combination, makes it act electrically like a [[Q factor|high Q]] [[tuned circuit]].  VLF antennas have very narrow [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and to change the transmitting frequency requires a variable inductor ([[variometer]]) to tune the antenna.  The large VLF antennas used for high power transmitters usually have bandwidths of only a few tens of hertz, and when transmitting [[frequency shift keying]] (FSK), the usual mode, the resonant frequency of the antenna must sometimes be dynamically shifted with the modulation, between the two FSK frequencies.\n\nThe requirements for receiving antennas are less stringent, because the transmitter power is generally high to overcome [[atmospheric noise]].  Atmospheric noise and not [[Noise figure|receiver noise]] determines the receiver [[signal to noise ratio]], so small inefficient receiving antennas can be used.  [[Loop antenna]]s are often used for reception.\n\n==Applications==\n[[Image:Grimetonmasterna.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the [[antenna (radio)|aerial]] of the [[Grimeton VLF transmitter]]]]\n\nThe frequency range below 9&nbsp;kHz is not allocated by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] and may be used in some nations license-free.\n\nVLF is used to [[Communication with submarines|communicate with submarines]] near the [[Sea surface|surface]] (for example using the transmitter [[VLF transmitter DHO38|DHO38]]), while [[Extremely low frequency|ELF]] is used for deeply submerged vessels. VLF is also used for radio navigation beacons (alpha) and time signals (beta).\n\nIn the USA, the [[time signal]] station [[WWVL]] began transmitting a 500&nbsp;W signal on 20&nbsp;kHz in August 1963.  It used Frequency Shift Keying ([[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]]) to send data, shifting between 20&nbsp;kHz and 26&nbsp;kHz. The WWVL service was discontinued in July 1972.\n\nHistorically, this band was used for transcontinental radio communication during the [[wireless telegraphy]] era between about 1900 and 1925.  Nations built networks of high power LF and VLF radio stations which transmitted text information by [[Morse code]],  to communicate with their colonies and naval fleets.    Early attempts were made to use radiotelephone using [[amplitude modulation]] and [[single-sideband modulation]] within the band starting from 20&nbsp;kHz, but the result was unsatisfactory because the available bandwidth was insufficient to contain the [[sideband]]s.  The [[Grimeton VLF transmitter]] at Grimeton near Varberg in [[Sweden]], one of the few remaining transmitters from that era which has been preserved as a historical monument,  can be visited by the public at certain times, such as on [[Alexanderson Day]].\n\nNaturally occurring signals in the VLF band are used for long range lightning location and for research into phenomena such as [[Upper-atmospheric lightning|transient luminous events]].  Measurements of [[Whistler (radio)|whistlers]] are employed to infer the physical properties of the [[magnetosphere]].\n\n[[Geophysicists]] use VLF-[[electromagnetic]] receivers to measure conductivity in the near surface of the Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geonics.com/html/vlfsystems.html|title=Geonics Limited - VLF Receivers|accessdate=13 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n==VLF submarine communication methods==\nHigh power land-based transmitters in countries that operate submarines send signals that can be received thousands of miles away. Transmitter sites typically cover great areas (many [[acres]] or square kilometres), with transmitted power anywhere from 20&nbsp;kW to 2 MW. Submarines receive the signal using some form of towed antenna which floats just under the surface of the water \u2013 for example a BCAA ([[Buoyant Cable Array Antenna]]). Modern receivers use sophisticated [[digital signal processing]] techniques to remove the effects of atmospheric noise (largely caused by lightning strikes around the world) and adjacent channel signals, extending the useful reception range.\n\nBecause of the low bandwidth available it is not possible to transmit audio signals, therefore all messaging is done with alphanumeric data at very low bit rates. Three types of [[modulation]] are used:\n* OOK / CWK: On-Off Keying / Continuous Wave Keying. Simple [[Morse code]] transmission mode where carrier on = mark and off = space. This is the simplest possible form of radio transmission, but it is difficult for transmitters to transmit high power levels, and the signal can easily be swamped by atmospheric noise, so this is only really used for emergencies or basic testing.\n* FSK: [[Frequency-shift keying]]. The oldest and simplest form of digital radio data modulation. Frequency is increased by 25&nbsp;Hz (for example) from the carrier to indicate a binary \"1\" and reduced by 25&nbsp;Hz to indicate binary \"0\". FSK is used at rates of 50 bit/s and 75 bit/s.\n* MSK: [[Minimum-shift keying]]. A more sophisticated modulation method that uses less bandwidth for a given data rate than FSK. This is the normal mode for submarine communications today, and can be used at data rates up to 300 bit/s- or about 35 8-bit [[ASCII]] characters per second (or the equivalence of a sentence every two seconds) \u2013 a total of 450 words per minute.\n\nTwo alternative character sets may be used: 5-bit [[ITA2]] or 8-bit [[ASCII]]. Because these are military transmissions they are almost always [[encrypted]] for security reasons. Although it is relatively easy to receive the transmissions and convert them into a string of characters, civilians cannot decode any encrypted messages because they most likely use [[one-time pad]]s since the amount of text is so small.\n\n==PC-based VLF reception==\n\n[[File:VLF 18.1 kHz spectrogram.svg|thumb|[[Spectrogram]] of a 18.1 kHz VLF signal, picked up using a small [[loop antenna]] and a sound card. The vertical stripes are distant lightnings.]]\nVLF signals are often monitored by [[radio amateur]]s using simple homemade VLF [[radio receiver]]s based on personal computers (PCs).<ref>{{cite book\n|author=Renato Romero, IK1QFK\n|title = Radio Nature\n|year = 2008\n|isbn = 9781-9050-8637-5\n|pages = 77\n|publisher = [[Radio Society of Great Britain]] \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|author = Mardina Abdullah|title = Development of UKM-SID teaching module for space science education (6th International Forum on Engineering Education 2012 (IFEE 2012))\n|journal = Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences \n|volume = 102 \n|pages = 80\u201385\n|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042813042523\n|year = 2013 |doi = 10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.10.716\n|display-authors=etal}}</ref> An aerial in the form of a coil of insulated wire is connected to the input of the soundcard of the PC (via a jack plug) and placed a few metres away from it. [[Fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) software in combination with a sound card allows reception of all frequencies below the [[Nyquist frequency]] simultaneously in the form of [[spectrogram]]mes. Because CRT monitors are strong sources of noise in the VLF range, it is recommended to record the spectrograms with any PC CRT monitors turned off.\nThese spectrograms show many signals, which may include VLF transmitters and the horizontal electron beam deflection of TV sets. The strength of the signal received can vary with a [[Sudden Ionospheric Disturbance]]. These cause the ionization level to drop in the atmosphere. The result of this is that the VLF signal will reflect down to Earth with greater strength.\n\n==List of VLF transmissions==\nFor a more detailed list, see [[List of VLF-transmitters]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
