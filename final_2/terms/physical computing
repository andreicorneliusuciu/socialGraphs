In the broad sense, physical computing is a creative framework for understanding human beings' relationship to the [[Digital data|digital]] world. In practical use, the term most often describes handmade art, design or [[DIY]] hobby projects that use [[sensor]]s and [[microcontroller]]s to translate analog input to a [[software system]], and/or control [[electro-mechanical]] devices such as [[Electric motor|motor]]s, [[Servomechanism|servo]]s, [[lighting]] or other hardware.\n\n[[File:Physical computing.svg|500px|frameless|right|Physical computing]]\n\n== Examples ==\n\nPhysical computing is used in a wide variety of domains and applications.\n\n===In Museums===\nThe [[Exploratorium]], a pioneer in [[inquiry based learning]], developed some of the earliest interactive exhibitry involving computers, and continues to include more and more examples of physical computing and [[tangible interface]]s as associated technologies progress.\n\n===In Art===\nIn the art world, projects that implement physical computing include the work of [[Scott Snibbe]], [[Daniel Rozin]], [[Rafael Lozano-Hemmer]], [[Jonah Brucker-Cohen]], [[Camille Utterback]], [[Virtual Reality]] VR/shyam, [[Augmented Reality]] AR/hiren, and Electroland [[LED art]].\n\n===In Product Design===\nPhysical computing practices also exist in the product and interaction design sphere, where hand-built [[embedded system]]s are sometimes used to rapidly prototype new digital product concepts in a cost-efficient way. Firms such as [[IDEO]] and [[Teague (company)|Teague]] are known to approach [[product design]] in this way.\n\n===In Commercial Applications===\nCommercial implementations range from consumer devices such as the [[Sony Eyetoy]] or games such as [[Dance Dance Revolution]] to more esoteric and pragmatic uses such as [[machine vision]] used in the automation of quality inspection along a factory [[assembly line]]. [[Exergaming]] can be considered a form of physical computing. Other implementations of physical computing include [[speech recognition|voice recognition]], which senses and interprets sound waves via microphones or other soundwave sensing devices, and [[computer vision]], which applies algorithms to a rich stream of [[video]] data typically sensed by some form of camera. [[Haptic technology|Haptic]] interfaces are also an example of physical computing, though in this case the computer is ''generating'' the physical stimulus as opposed to ''sensing'' it. Both [[motion capture]] and [[gesture recognition]] are fields that rely on computer vision to work their magic.\n\n===In Scientific Applications===\nPhysical computing can also describe the fabrication and use of custom sensors or collectors for scientific experiments, though the term is rarely used to describe them as such. An example of physical computing modeling is the ''[[Illustris project]]'', which attempts to precisely simulate the [[Chronology of the universe|evolution of the universe]] from the [[Big Bang]] to the present day, [[Age of the universe|13.8 billion years]] later.<ref name=\"IP-20140614\">{{cite web |author=Staff |title=The Illustris Simulation - Towards a predictive theory of galaxy formation. |url=http://www.illustris-project.org/ |date=14 June 2014 |work=[http://www.illustris-project.org Illustris Project] |accessdate=16 July 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"ARX-20140514\">{{cite arXiv |author1=Vogelsberger, Mark |author2=Genel, Shy |author3=Springel, Volker |author4=Torrey, Paul |author5=Sijacki, Debora |author6=Xu, Dandan |author7=Snyder, Greg |author8=Nelson, Dylan |author9=Hernquist, Lars |title=Introducing the Illustris Project: Simulating the coevolution of dark and visible matter in the Universe |date=14 May 2014  |arxiv=1405.2921  |}}</ref>\n\n== Methods ==\nPrototyping plays an important role in Physical Computing.
