Incandescence usually refers specifically to [[visible light]], while thermal radiation refers also to [[infrared]] or any other [[electromagnetic radiation]].\n\nFor a detailed discussion of the intensity and spectrum (color) of incandescence, see the article: [[thermal radiation]].\n\n==Observation and use==\n{{main|Thermal radiation}}\nIn practice, virtually all solid or liquid substances start to glow around {{convert|798|K|C}} (977 \u02daF), with a mildly dull red color, whether or not a chemical reaction takes place that produce light as a result of an exothermic process. This limit is called the [[Draper point]]. The incandescence does not vanish below that temperature, but it is too weak in the visible spectrum to be perceivable.\n\nAt higher temperatures, the substance becomes brighter and its color changes from red towards white and finally blue.\n\nIncandescence is exploited in [[incandescent light bulb]]s, in which a filament is heated to a temperature at which a fraction of the radiation falls in the visible spectrum. The majority of the radiation however, is emitted in the infrared part of the spectrum, rendering incandescent lights relatively inefficient as a light source.<ref>{{cite book | title = Illumination and Photometry | author = William Elgin Wickenden | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1910 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gVZDAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA3&dq=incandescent+low-efficiency+blackbody }}</ref> If the filament could be made hotter, efficiency would increase; however, there are currently no materials able to withstand such temperatures which would be appropriate for use in lamps.\n\nMore efficient light sources, such as [[fluorescent lamp]]s and [[LED]]s, do not function by incandescence.\n\n[[Sunlight]] is the incandescence of the \"white hot\" surface of the [[sun]].\n\n==Figurative use==\nThe word ''incandescent'' is also used figuratively to describe a person who is so angry that they are imagined to glow or burn red hot or white hot.<ref>Example 1:'...the stadium positively crackled with the incandescent anger of anguished supporters.'
