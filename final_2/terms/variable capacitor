Variable capacitors are often used in [[LC circuit|L/C circuits]] to set the resonance frequency, e.g. to tune a radio (therefore it is sometimes called a '''tuning capacitor''' or '''tuning condenser'''), or as a variable [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]], e.g. for [[impedance matching]] in [[antenna tuner]]s.\n\n==Mechanically controlled==\n[[Image:Forgokondenzator rajz en.svg|thumb|Principle of the rotary variable capacitor]]\nIn mechanically controlled variable capacitors, the distance between the plates, or the amount of plate surface area which overlaps, can be changed.\n\nThe most common form arranges a group of semicircular metal plates on a rotary axis (\u201crotor\u201d) that are positioned in the gaps between a set of stationary plates (\u201cstator\u201d) so that the area of overlap can be changed by rotating the axis.  Air or plastic foils can be used as [[dielectric]] material.\nBy choosing the shape of the rotary plates, various functions of capacitance vs. angle can be created, e.g. to obtain a linear frequency scale.  Various forms of reduction [[gear]] mechanisms are often used to achieve finer tuning control, i.e. to spread the variation of capacity over a larger angle, often several turns.\n\n<center>\n<gallery caption=\"Measurement of the capacitance of a rotary capacitor\" widths=\"180\"> \nFile: Forgokondenzator1.jpg | ''C''<sub>min</sub> = 29 pF\nFile: Forgokondenzator2.jpg| ''C'' = 269 pF \nFile: Forgokondenzator3.jpg | ''C''<sub>max</sub> = 520 pF\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\nA vacuum variable capacitor uses a set of plates made from concentric cylinders that can be slid in or out of an opposing set of cylinders{{ref|can}} (sleeve and plunger). These plates are then sealed inside of a non-conductive envelope such as glass or ceramic and placed under a high [[vacuum]]. The movable part (plunger) is mounted on a flexible metal membrane that seals and maintains the vacuum. A screw shaft is attached to the plunger, when the shaft is turned the plunger moves in or out of the sleeve and the value of the capacitor changes. The [[vacuum]] not only increases the working [[voltage]] and [[Electric current|current]] handling capacity of the [[capacitor]] it also greatly reduces the chance of [[Electric arc|arcing]] across the plates. The most common usage for vacuum variables are in high powered [[transmitter]]s such as those used for [[broadcasting]], [[military]] and [[amateur radio]] as well as high powered [[Antenna tuner|RF tuning network]]s. Vacuum variables can also be more convenient since the elements are under a vacuum the working voltage can be higher than an air variable the same size, allowing the size of the vacuum capacitor to be reduced.\n\nVery cheap variable capacitors are constructed from layered aluminium and plastic foils that are variably pressed together using a screw.  These so-called ''squeezers'' can\u2019t provide a stable and reproducible capacitance, however. A variant of this structure that allows for linear movement of one set of plates to change the plate overlap area is also used and might be called a ''slider''. This has practical advantages for makeshift or home construction and may be found in resonant loop antennas or crystal radios.\n\nSmall variable capacitors operated by screwdriver (for instance, to precisely set a resonant frequency at the factory and then never be adjusted again) are called [[trimmer (electronics)|trimmer]] capacitors.  In addition to air and plastic, trimmers can also be made using a ceramic dielectric.\n\n==Electronically controlled==\nThe thickness of the depletion layer of a reverse-biased semiconductor [[diode]] varies with the DC voltage applied across the diode.  Any diode exhibits this effect (including p/n junctions in transistors), but devices specifically sold as variable capacitance diodes (also called varactors or [[varicap]]s) are designed with a large junction area and a doping profile specifically designed to maximize capacitance.\n\nTheir use is limited to low signal amplitudes to avoid obvious distortions as the capacitance would be affected by the change of signal voltage, precluding their use in the input stages of high-quality RF communications receivers, where they would add unacceptable levels of [[intermodulation]].  At [[VHF]]/[[UHF]] frequencies, e.g. in FM Radio or TV tuners, dynamic range is limited by noise rather than large signal handling requirements, and varicaps are commonly used in the signal path.\n\nVaricaps are used for [[frequency modulation]] of oscillators, and to make high-frequency [[voltage controlled oscillator]]s (VCOs), the core component in [[phase-locked loop]] (PLL) [[frequency synthesizer]]s that are ubiquitous in modern communications equipment.\n\n=== Digitally tuned capacitor ===\nA '''digitally tuned capacitor''' is an [[Integrated circuit|IC]] variable capacitor based on several technologies.  MEMS, BST and SOI/SOS devices are available from a number of suppliers and vary in capacitance range, quality factor and resolution for different RF tuning applications.\n\nMEMS devices have the highest quality factor and are highly linear, and therefore are suitable for antenna aperture tuning, dynamic impedance matching, power amplifier load matching and adjustable filters.  RF tuning MEMS are still a relatively new technology and has not yet been accepted broadly.\n\nBST device are based on Barium Strontium Titanate and vary the capacitance by applying high voltage to the device.  The tuning accuracy is limited only by the accuracy of the D-A converter circuitry that generates the high voltage.  The limitations for BST are stability over temperature and linearity in demanding applications.\n\nSOI/SOS tuning devices are constructed as solid state FET switches built on insulated CMOS wafers and use MIM caps arranged in binary-weighted values to achieve different capacitance values.  SOI/SOS switches have high lineary and are well suited to low power applications where high voltages are not present.  High voltage endurance requires multiple FET devices in series which adds series resistance and lowers the quality factor.\n\nThe capacitance values are designed for [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] [[impedance matching]] in multi-band [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] [[GSM]]/[[W-CDMA (UMTS)|WCDMA]] cellular handsets and mobile TV receivers that operate over wide frequency ranges, such as the European [[DVB-H]] and Japanese [[ISDB-T#ISDB-T|ISDB-T]] mobile TV systems.<ref name=\"DigitallyTunedCap2\">{{cite web |url=http://electronicdesign.com/article/communications/automatic-digital-antenna-tuning-fits-multiple-wir.aspx|title=Automatic Digital Antenna Tuning Fits Multiple Wireless Applications|accessdate=3-7-2010}}</ref>\n\n==Transducers==\nVariable capacitance is sometimes used to convert physical phenomena into electrical signals.\n\n* In a capacitor [[microphone]] (commonly known as a condenser microphone), the diaphragm acts as one plate of a capacitor, and vibrations produce changes in the distance between the diaphragm and a fixed plate, changing the voltage maintained across the capacitor plates.\n* Some types of industrial sensors use a capacitor element to convert physical quantities such as [[pressure]], [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] or [[relative humidity]] to an electrical signal for measurement purposes.\n* Capacitive sensors can also be used in the place of [[switch]]es, e.g. in computer keyboards or \u201ctouch buttons\u201d for elevators that have no user-movable parts.\n\n==Special forms of mechanically variable capacitors==\n[[Image:Variable-capacitors.agr.jpg|thumb|Various forms of variable capacitors]]\n\n===Multiple sections===\nVery often, multiple stator/rotor sections are arranged behind one another on the same axis, allowing for several tuned circuits to be adjusted using the same control, e.g. a preselector, an input filter and the corresponding oscillator in a receiver circuit.  The sections can have identical or different nominal capacitances, e.g. 2 &times; 330 pF for AM filter and oscillator, plus 3 &times; 45 pF for two filters and an oscillator in the FM section of the same receiver.  Capacitors with multiple sections often include trimmer capacitors in parallel to the variable sections, used to adjust all tuned circuits to the same frequency.\n\n===Butterfly===\nA '''butterfly capacitor''' is a form of rotary variable capacitor with two independent sets of stator plates opposing each other, and a [[butterfly]]-shaped rotor arranged so that turning the rotor will vary the capacitances between the rotor and either stator equally.\n\nButterfly capacitors are used in symmetrical tuned circuits, e.g. [[Radio frequency|RF]] power [[amplifier]] stages in [[push-pull output|push-pull]] configuration or symmetrical [[antenna tuner]]s where the rotor needs to be \u201ccold\u201d, i.e. connected to RF (but not necessarily [[Direct current|DC]]) [[ground (electricity)|ground]] potential.  Since the peak RF current normally flows from one stator to the other without going through wiper contacts, butterfly capacitors can handle large resonance RF currents, e.g. in [[loop antenna|magnetic loop antennas]].\n\nIn a butterfly capacitor, the stators and each half of the rotor can only cover a maximum angle of 90\u00b0 since there must be a position without rotor/stator overlap corresponding to minimum capacity, therefore a turn of only 90\u00b0 covers the entire capacitance range.<ref name=\"butterfly\">[http://homepages.tesco.net/~a.wadsworth/capacitors.htm G3NPF and M1AIM Home Page Technical Section (Capacitors)]</ref>\n\n===Split stator===\nThe closely related '''split stator variable capacitor''' does not have the limitation of 90\u00b0 angle since it uses two separate packs of rotor electrodes arranged axially behind one another.  Unlike in a capacitor with several sections, the rotor plates in a split stator capacitor are mounted on opposite sides of the rotor axis.  While the split stator capacitor benefits from larger electrodes compared to the butterfly capacitor, as well as a rotation angle of up to 180\u00b0, the separation of rotor plates incurs some losses since RF current has to pass the rotor axis instead of flowing straight through each rotor vane.\n\n===Differential===\n'''Differential variable capacitors''' also have two independent stators, but unlike in the butterfly capacitor where capacities on both sides increase equally as the rotor is turned, in a differential variable capacitor one section's capacity will increase while the other section's decreases, keeping the stator-to-stator capacitance constant.  Differential variable capacitors can therefore be used in capacitive [[potentiometer|potentiometric]] circuits.\n\n==History==\nThe variable capacitor with air dielectric was invented by the [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] engineer [[Dezs\u0151 Korda]]. He received a [[German Empire|German]] patent for the invention on 13th&nbsp;December 1893.\n<ref>George Washington Pierce: [https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7089083M/Principles_of_wireless_telegraphy ''Principles of wireless telegraphy''], McGraw-Hill book company, New York, 1910, [https://archive.org/stream/principlesofwire00pierrich#page/114/mode/2up p. 114.] (Photo of rotary capacitor of Korda).</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n#{{note|can}} A makeshift version of this design, using two tin cans with slightly different diameter isolated by cardboard, has been used to make variable capacitors in emergencies, e.g. by concentration camp inmates.\n# While mechanical variable capacitors have been used and are still used extensively in electronics, their use in radios is diminishing. Radios now often use digital frequency synthesizers for tuning rather than analog (tank) oscillators.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Variable capacitors}}\n* [http://www.eham.net/articles/5217 Build your own air variable capacitor]\n* [http://www.jogis-roehrenbude.de/Roehren-Geschichtliches/Drehko/Drehko.htm High-res images of historical variable capacitors]\n* [http://www.iequalscdvdt.com Introduction to capacitors]\n* [http://www.glvac.com/product/type/35-1.html Introduction to Variable Vacuum Capacitor]\n\n{{Electronic component}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Variable Capacitor}}\n[[Category:Capacitors]]\n[[Category:Wireless tuning and filtering]]\n\n[[pt:Capacitor#Capacitores vari\u00e1veis]]"}]}}}}
