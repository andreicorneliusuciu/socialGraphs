They typically are [[autonomous robot|autonomous]] and/or operated by a built-in control system, with manual override options.\nThe term \"service robot\" does not have a strict technical definition. The [[International Federation of Robotics]] ([[International Federation of Robotics|IFR]]) has proposed a tentative definition: \"A service robot is a robot which operates semi- or fully  autonomously to perform services useful to the well-being of humans and equipment, excluding manufacturing operations.\"<ref name=\"ifr.org\">[http://www.ifr.org/service-robots/ Provisional definition of Service Robots] English, 27th of October 2012</ref>\n\n==Types==\nThe possible applications of robots to assist in human chores is widespread. At present there are a few main categories that these robots fall into.\n\n===Industrial===\nIndustrial service robots can be used to carry out simple tasks, such as examining welding, as well as more complex, harsh-environment tasks, such as aiding in the dismantling of nuclear power stations. [[Industrial robot|Industrial robots]] have been defined by the [[International Federation of Robotics]] as \"an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose manipulator programmable in three or more axes, which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications\".<ref>http://www.ifr.org/industrial-robots/</ref>\n\n===Domestic===\n{{main|Domestic robot}}\n[[Image:Roomba3g.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Roomba]] vacuum cleaner is one of the most popular domestic service robots.{{citation needed|reason=how do you know it is the most popular|date=October 2015}}]]  \nDomestic robots perform tasks that humans regularly perform around their homes such as cleaning floors, mowing the lawn and pool maintenance{{citation needed|reason=need more than previous link to Roomba article|date=October 2015}}. People with disabilities, as well as people who are older, may soon be able to use service robots to help them live independently.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Graf |first=Birgit |last2=Hans |first2=Matthias |last3=Schraft |first3=Rolf D. |date=2004 |title=Care-O-bot II\u2014Development of a Next Generation Robotic Home Assistant |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B%3AAURO.0000016865.35796.e9 |journal= Autonomous Robots |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=193-205 |doi=10.1023/B:AURO.0000016865.35796.e9 |access-date=21 October 2015}}</ref> It is also possible to use robots as assistants or butlers{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.\n\n===Scientific===\nRobotic systems perform many functions such as repetitive tasks performed in research. These range from the multiple repetitive tasks made by gene samplers and sequencers, to systems which can almost replace the scientist in designing and running experiments, analysing data and even forming hypotheses.  The ADAM at the University of Aberystwyth in Wales can \"[make] logical assumptions based on information programmed into it about yeast metabolism and the way proteins and genes work in other species. It then set about proving that its predictions were correct.\"<ref name=DM1>{{cite web|title=Adam becomes first robot to make a scientific discovery after conducting its OWN experiments |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1167004/Adam-robot-make-scientific-discovery-conducting-OWN-experiments.html|publisher=Dail Mail|accessdate=31 January 2011|date=3 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nAutonomous scientific robots perform tasks which humans would find difficult or impossible, from the deep sea to outer space. The [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|Woods Hole]] [[Sentry (AUV)|Sentry]] can descend to 4,500 metres and allows a higher payload as it does not need a support ship or the oxygen and other facilities demanded by [[Submersible|human piloted vessels]].<ref name=WHOI1>{{cite web|title=AUV Sentry|url=http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=38095|publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|accessdate=31 January 2011}}</ref> Robots in space include the [[Mars rover]]s which could carry out sampling and photography in the harsh environment of the atmosphere on Mars.\n\n==Examples of service robots==\n* [http://www.techunited.nl/en/amigo AMIGO]\n* [[Care-O-bot]]\n* [[PatrolBot]]\n* [[CoroBot]]\n* [[ADAM SGV]]\n* [[Justin (robot)|Rollin' Justin]]\n* [[HelpMate]]\n* [[Cybermotion]]\n* [[Roomba]]\n* [http://www.service-robotik-initiative.de/uebersicht/uebersicht/ DESIRE]\n* [http://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/nimbro/@Home Cosero]\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Robotics}}\n* [[Domestic robot]]\n* [[Home automation for the elderly and disabled]]\n* [[Robot kit]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Haidegger T, Barreto M, Goncalves P, Habib MK, Ragavan SKV, Li H et al (2013) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092188901300105X Applied ontologies and standards for service robots].
