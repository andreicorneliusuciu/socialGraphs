The Woodward effect is focused primarily on proving the hypothesis and providing the basis of a Mach effect impulse thruster. In the first of three general Mach effects for propulsion or transport, the Woodward effect is an impulse effect usable for in-orbit satellite stationkeeping, spacecraft reaction control systems, or at best, thrust within the solar system. The second and third effects are open and closed spacetime effects. Open curved spacetime effects can be applied in a field generation system to produce warp fields. Closed-curve spacetime effects would be part of a field generation system to generate wormholes.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThe third Mach effect is a closed-curve [[spacetime]] effect or [[closed timelike curve]] called a benign wormhole. Closed-curve space is generally known as a [[wormhole]] or [[black hole]]. Prompted by [[Carl Sagan]] for the scientific basis of wormhole transport in the movie ''Contact'', [[Kip Thorne]]<ref>http://www.its.caltech.edu/~kip/</ref> developed the theory of benign wormholes. The generation, stability, and traffic control of transport through a benign wormhole is only theoretical at present.

Several devices could be built to [[accumulator (energy)|store internal energy]] during accelerations. A measurable effect needs to be driven at a high [[frequency]], so [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] [[mechanical system]]s are out of question since the rate at which their internal energy could be modified is too limited. The only systems that could run at a high frequency are [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] energy storage devices. For fast transient effects, [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] are ruled out. A magnetic energy storage device like an [[inductor]] using a high-[[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] [[magnetic core|core material]] to transfer the [[magnetic energy]] could be especially built. But [[capacitor]]s are preferable to inductors because compact devices storing energy at a very high [[energy density]] without [[electrical breakdown]] are readily available. Shielding [[electromagnetic interference|electrical interferences]] are easier than [[magnetic shielding#Magnetic shielding|shielding magnetic]] ones. [[Ferroelectricity|Ferroelectric]] materials can be used to make high-frequency [[linear actuator#Electro-mechanical actuators|electro-mechanical actuators]], and they are themselves capacitors so they can be used for both energy storage and acceleration. Finally, capacitors are cheap and available in various configurations. So Mach effect experiments have always relied on capacitors so far.\n\nWhen the [[dielectric]] of a capacitor is submitted to a varying [[electric power]] (charge or discharge), Woodward's hypothesis predicts<ref name=\"Woodward2004b\"/> a transient mass fluctuation arises according to the transient mass equation (TME):\n:<math>\\delta m_0 = \\frac{1}{4\\pi G}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\rho_0 c^2}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial t} - \\left(\\frac{1}{\\rho_0 c^2}\\right)^2 \\frac{P^2}{V}\\right]</math>\n\nwhere:\n*<math>m_0</math> is the [[invariant mass|proper mass]] of the dielectric,\n*<math>G</math> is the [[gravitational constant]],\n*<math>c</math> is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum,\n*<math>\\rho_0</math> is the proper [[density]] of the dielectric,\n*<math>V</math> is the volume of the dielectric,\n*<math>P</math> is the instantaneous power delivered to the system.\n\nThis equation is not the full Woodward equation as seen in the book. There is a third term, <math> - \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\phi}{c^2} \\right)^2 </math>, which Woodward discounts because his [[gauge theory|gauge]] sets <math>\\frac{\\phi}{c^2} \\approx 1</math>; the derivatives of this quantity must therefore be negligible.<ref name=\"Woodward2004b\"/>\n\n===Propellantless propulsion===\nThe previous equation shows that when the [[dielectric]] material of a [[capacitor]] is cyclically charged then discharged while being accelerated, its [[density|mass density]] fluctuates, by around plus or minus its [[invariant mass|rest mass]] value. Therefore, a device can be made to [[oscillate]] either in a linear or orbital path, such that its mass density is higher while the mass is moving forward, and lower while moving backward, thus creating an [[acceleration]] of the device in the forward direction, i.e. a thrust. This effect, used repeatedly, does not expel any [[particle]] and thus would represent a type of apparent [[reactionless drive|propellantless propulsion]], which seems to be in contradiction with [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law of motion]]. However, Woodward states there is no violation of momentum conservation in Mach effects:<ref name=\"WoodwardSpurious2012\"/>\n{{cquote\n |''If we produce a fluctuating mass in an object, we can, at least in principle, use it to produce a stationary force on the object, thereby producing a propulsive force thereon without having to expel propellant from the object. We simply push on the object when it is more massive, and pull back when it is less massive. The reaction forces during the two parts of the cycle will not be the same due to the mass fluctuation, so a time-averaged net force will be produced. '''This may seem to be a violation of momentum conservation. But the [[Lorentz invariance]] of the theory guarantees that no conservation law is broken. Local momentum conservation is preserved by the [[flux]] of [[momentum]] in the gravity field that is chiefly exchanged with the distant matter in the universe.'''''\n}}\n\nTwo terms are important for propulsion on the right-hand side of the previous equation:\n*The first, [[linear equation|linear term]] <math>\\tfrac{1}{\\rho_0 c^2}\\tfrac{\\partial P}{\\partial t}</math> is called the \"[[impulse (physics)|impulse]] engine\" term because it expresses mass fluctuation depending on the derivative of the power, and scales linearly with the frequency. Past and current experiments about Mach effect [[wikt:thruster|thruster]]s are designed to demonstrate thrust and the control of one type of Mach effect.\n*The second, [[quadratic equation|quadratic term]] <math>-\\left(\\tfrac{1}{\\rho_0 c^2}\\right)^2 \\tfrac{P^2}{V}</math> is what Woodward calls the \"[[wormhole]]\" term, because ''it is always negative''. Although this term appears to be many [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] weaker than the first term, which makes it usually negligible, theoretically, the second term's effect could become huge in some circumstances. The second term, the wormhole term, is indeed driven by the first impulse engine term, which fluctuates mass by around plus or minus the rest mass value. When fluctuations reach a very high amplitude and mass density is driven very close to zero, the equation shows that mass should achieve very large negative values very quickly, with a strong non-linear behavior. In this regard, the Woodward effect could generate [[exotic matter]], although this still remains very speculative due to the lack of any available experiment that would highlight such an effect.\n\nApplications of propellantless propulsion include straight-line [[wikt:thruster|thruster]] or impulse engine, open curved fields for starship [[warp drive]]s, and even the possibility of closed curved fields such as traversable benign [[wormhole]]s.\n<ref>{{cite web\n |author=Ramos, Debra Cano\n |title=Starships, Stargates, Wormholes and Interstellar Travel: Science Historian and Physicist Contemplates the Challenging Physics of Space Travel\n |url=http://news.fullerton.edu/2013sp/Woodward-Book.asp\n |date=19 February 2013\n |accessdate=2 March 2013}}\n</ref>\n\n==Space travel==\nCurrent [[spacecraft]] achieve a change in velocity by the expulsion of [[propellant]], the extraction of momentum from stellar [[radiation pressure]] or the [[stellar wind]] or the utilisation of a [[gravity assist]] (\"slingshot\") from a planet or moon.

This ceramic is [[piezoelectric]], so it can be used as an electromechanical actuator to accelerate an object placed against it: its [[crystal structure|crystalline structure]] expands when a certain [[electrical polarity]] is applied, then contracts when the opposite field is applied.\n\nIn the first tests, Woodward simply used a [[capacitor]] between two stacks of PZT disks. The capacitor, while being electrically charged to change its internal energy density, is shuttled back and forth between the PZT actuators. [[Piezoelectric]] materials can also generate a measurable voltage potential across their two faces when pressed, so Woodward first used some small portions of PZT material as little [[accelerometer]]s put on the surface of the stack, to precisely tune the device with the power supply. Then Woodward realized that PZT material and the [[dielectric]] of a capacitor were very similar, so he built devices that are made exclusively of PZT disks, without any conventional capacitor, applying different signals to different portions of the cylindrical stack. The available picture taken by his graduate student Tom Mahood in 1999 shows a typical all-PZT stack with different disks:<ref name=mahood>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.otherhand.org/home-page/physics/graduate-studies-in-physics-at-cal-state-university-fullerton/\n |title=Graduate studies in Physics at Cal State University, Fullerton\n |last=Mahood\n |first=Thomas\n |accessdate=27 January 2014}}</ref>\n*The outer, thicker disks on the left and right are the \"shuttlers\".\n*The inner stack of thin disks in the center are the shuttled capacitors storing energy during acceleration, where any mass shift would occur.\n*The even thinner disks placed between the shuttlers and on both side of the inner disk capacitors are the \"squeezometers' acting as accelerometers.\nDuring forward acceleration and before the transient mass change in the capacitor decays, the resultant increased [[momentum]] is transferred forward to a bulk \"reaction mass\" through an [[elastic collision]] (the [[brass]] end cap on the left in the picture). Conversely, the following decrease in the mass density takes place during its backward movement.\nWhile operating, the PZT stack is isolated in a Faraday cage and put on a sensitive [[torsion spring|torsion]] arm for thrust measurements, inside a vacuum chamber. Throughout the years, a wide variety of different types of devices and experimental setups have been tested. The force measuring setups have ranged from various load cell devices to [[ballistic pendulum]]s to multiple [[torsion spring|torsion]] arm pendulums, in which movement is actually observed. Those setups have been improved against spurious effects by isolating and canceling thermal transfers, vibration and electromagnetic interference, while getting better current feeds and bearings. Null tests were also conducted.<ref name=\"WoodwardSpurious2013\"/>\n[[File:Woodward Effect Device.png|thumb|250px|right|Photograph of the 2006 Woodward effect MLT test article.]]\nAnother type of Mach effect [[wikt:thruster|thruster]] is the Mach-Lorentz [[wikt:thruster|thruster]] (MLT). It uses a charging [[capacitor]] embedded in a magnetic field created by a magnetic coil. A Lorentz force, the cross product between the electric field and the magnetic field, appears and acts upon the ions inside the capacitor dielectric. In such electromagnetic experiments, the power can be applied at frequencies of several megahertz, unlike PZT stack actuators where frequency is limited to tens of kilohertz. The photograph shows the components of a Woodward effect test article used in a 2006 experiment.<ref name=\"AIP1\"/>\n\nIn the future, Woodward plans to scale thrust levels, switching from the current [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] [[dielectric]] [[ceramic]]s ([[lead zirconate titanate|PZT]] stacks) to new [[high-\u03ba dielectric]] [[nanocomposite]] [[polymer]]s, like [[electrostriction#Materials|PMN]], [[electrostriction#Materials|PMN-PT]] or [[calcium copper titanate|CCTO]].

Despite their ubiquitous nature, inertial frames are still not fully understood. That they exist is certain, but what causes them to exist \u2013 and whether these sources could constitute reaction-media \u2013 are still unknown. Marc Millis, of the NASA [[Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program]], stated \" ''For example, the notion of thrusting without propellant evokes objections of violating conservation of momentum. This, in turn, suggests that space drive research must address conservation of momentum. From there it is found that many relevant unknowns still linger regarding the source of the inertial frames against which conservation is referenced. Therefore, research should revisit the unfinished physics of inertial frames, but in the context of propulsive interactions.'' \"<ref name=\"Millis2010\">\n{{cite arXiv\n |author=Millis, M.

Some are partially correct and some have been dismissed as incorrect.<ref name=\"Rovelli, Carlo 2004\"/>\n\n===Conservation of momentum===\n\n[[Momentum]] is defined as mass times velocity. Conservation of momentum applies to velocity terms, usually described in a two dimensional plane with a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] diagram. A vector representing velocity has both direction and magnitude. A requirement for determining conservation of momentum is that an [[inertial frame]] or [[frame of reference]] for the observer be fixed. [[Inertial frames]] are well defined for constant velocity and conservation of momentum holds for all such frames. During acceleration or a change in acceleration, conservation of momentum applies to the local inertial frame (LIF) of instantaneous velocity, not to the [[proper acceleration]] a.k.a. coordinate acceleration), as measured by the accelerated observer.\n{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nA challenge to the mathematical foundations of Woodward's hypothesis were raised in a paper published by the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in 2001. In the paper, John Whealton noted that the experimental results of Oak Ridge scientists can be explained in terms of force contributions due to time-varying [[thermal expansion]], and stated that a laboratory demonstration produced 100 times the Woodward effect without resorting to non-Newtonian explanations.<ref name=whealton>\n{{cite web\n|first=J.H.|last=Whealton\n|url=http://web.ornl.gov/~webworks/cppr/y2001/pres/111404.pdf\n|title=Revised Theory of Transient Mass Fluctuations|publisher=United States Department of Energy\n|date=4 September 2001\n|accessdate=15 February 2015\n|format=PDF\n}}\n</ref> In response, Woodward published a criticism of Whealton's math and understanding of the physics involved, and built an experiment attempting to demonstrate the flaw.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=13020.0;attach=119594\n|publisher=NasaSpaceflight.com\n|last=Woodward\n|first=James F.\n|title=Answer to ORNL\n|accessdate=3 February 2013\n}}\n</ref>\n\nA rate of change in [[momentum]] represents a force, whereby '''F''' {{=}} ''m'''''a'''.

This second term has both delta mass and '''v''', which is measured instantaneously; this term will, in general, cancel out the force from the inertial response terms predicted by Woodward. Woodward argued that the d''m''/d''t'' '''v''' term does not represent a physical force on the device, because it vanishes in a frame where the device is momentarily stationary.<ref name=Woodward2004b/>\n\nIn an appendix to his thesis, Mahood argues that the unexpectedly small magnitude of the results in his experiments are a confirmation of the cancellation predicted by Whealton; the results are instead due to higher-order mass transients which are not exactly cancelled.<ref name=\"MahoodThesis\"/> Mahood would later describe this argument as \"one of the very few things I've done in my life that I actually regret\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mahood|first1=Thomas|title=Graduate studies in Physics at Cal State University, Fullerton|url=http://www.otherhand.org/home-page/physics/graduate-studies-in-physics-at-cal-state-university-fullerton/|website=Other Hand|accessdate=2014-10-13}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the momentum and energy exchange with distant matter guarantees global conservation of energy and momentum, this [[field (physics)|field]] exchange is supplied at no material cost, unlike the case with conventional fuels. For this reason, when the [[field (physics)|field]] exchange is ignored, a propellantless thruster behaves locally like a free energy device. This is immediately apparent from basic Newtonian analysis: if constant power produces constant thrust, then input energy is linear with time and output (kinetic) energy is quadratic with time. Thus there exists a break-even time (or distance or velocity) of operation, above which more energy is output than is input. The longer it is allowed to accelerate, the more pronounced will this effect become, as simple Newtonian physics predicts.\n\nConsidering those conservation issues, a Mach effect thruster relies on Mach's principle, hence it is not an electrical to kinetic [[transducer]], i.e. it does not convert [[electric energy]] to [[kinetic energy]]. Rather, a MET is a gravinertial [[transistor]] that controls the flow of gravinertial [[flux]], in and out of the active mass of the thruster. The primary power into the thruster is contained in the flux of the [[gravitational field]], not the electricity that powers the device. Failing to account for this flux, is much the same as failing to account for the [[wind]] on a [[sail]].<ref name=\"Stahl 2015\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mach-effect-physics-conservation-concerns-3-important-ron-stahl?trk=prof-post\n |title=Mach-Effect physics conservation concerns: 3 important observations\n |last=Stahl\n |first=Ron\n |date=21 February 2015\n |accessdate=26 February 2015\n}}</ref> Mach effects are relativistic by nature, and considering a spaceship accelerating with a Mach effect thruster, the propellant is not accelerating with the ship, so the situation should be treated as an accelerating and therefore [[non-inertial reference frame]], where '''F''' does not equal ''m'''''a'''.

The local reactive forces are generated and conveyed by momentum fluxes created in the QED vacuum field by the same process used to create momentum fluxes in the gravinertial field. White uses [[magnetohydrodynamics|MHD]] [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] [[right-hand rule|rules]] to quantify this local momentum interaction where in comparison Woodward applies [[condensed matter physics]].<ref name=\"Sonny2011\"/>\n\nBased on the White conjecture, the proposed theoretical device is called a [[quantum vacuum plasma thruster]] (QVPT) or Q-thruster. No experiments have been performed to date. Unlike a Mach effect thruster instantaneously exchanging momentum with the distant cosmic matter through the advanced/retarded waves ([[Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory]]) of the radiative gravinertial field, Sonny's \"Q-thruster\" would appear to violate momentum conservation, for the thrust would be produced by pushing off virtual \"Q\" particle/antiparticle pairs that would annihilate after they have been pushed on. However, it would not necessarily violate the law of conservation of energy, as it requires an electric current to function, much like any \"standard\" MHD thruster, and cannot produce more kinetic energy than its equivalent net energy input.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Media reaction==\n\nWoodward's claims in his papers and in space technology conference press releases of a potential breakthrough technology for spaceflight have generated interest in the popular press<ref name=\"cnet-news\">{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Smokeless-rockets-launching-soon/2100-11397_3-6073392.html\n |title=Smokeless rockets launching soon?\n |publisher=CNET\n |date=2006\n |accessdate=3 February 2013\n}}</ref><ref name=\"BoingBoing\">\n{{cite web |url=http://boingboing.net/2014/11/24/the-quest-for-a-reactionless-s.html |title=Strange thrust: the unproven science that could propel our children into space |last1=Platt |first1=Charles |date=24 November 2014 |website=Boing Boing}}</ref>\nand university news<ref name=\"csuf-news1\">{{cite web|url=http://news.fullerton.edu/2013sp/Woodward-Book.asp\n |title=Starships, Stargates, Wormholes and Interstellar Travel\n |publisher=CSUF News\n |date=19 February 2013\n}}</ref><ref name=\"csuf-news2\">{{cite web|url=http://news.fullerton.edu/2013sp/Woodward-Book-Excerpt.asp\n |title=Faculty Author on the Science of Deep Space Travel\n |publisher=CSUF News\n |date=10 April 2013\n}}</ref>\nas well as the space news media.<ref name=\"io9-2013\">\n{{cite web\n |url=http://io9.com/5972727/the-woodward-effect-allows-for-endless-supplies-of-starship-fuel\n |author=Inglis-Arkell, Esther\n |title=The Woodward Effect allows for endless supplies of starship fuel\n |publisher=io9\n |date=3 January 2013\n |accessdate=6 March 2013\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/2819406/interstellar-propulsion-quest-empty-space |title=Strange thrust: the unproven science that could propel our children into space |last1=Szames |first1=Alexandre |date=January 2000 |periodical=Interavia Business & Technology |volume=55 |issue=638 |page=30 |issn=1423-3215}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.thespaceshow.com/detail.asp?q=689\n |title=The Space Show: Dr. James Woodward\n |publisher=thespaceshow.com\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=796\n |author=Gilster, Paul\n |title=Gravity, Inertia, Exotica\n |publisher=Tau Zero Foundation\n |date=28 August 2006\n |accessdate=25 February 2013\n}}</ref>\nWoodward also gave a video interview<ref name=aa_vimeo>{{Vimeo\n |id=85105575\n |title=Mach effect: warp drives and stargates by Jim Woodward}}</ref>\nfor the TV show [[Ancient Aliens]], season 6, episode 12.<ref name=hist_s6>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.history.com/shows/ancient-aliens/episodes\n |title=Ancient Aliens Episode Guide\n |publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History channel]]\n |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}</ref>\nHowever doubters do exist.<ref name=\"io9-2013\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Adelberger, E.
