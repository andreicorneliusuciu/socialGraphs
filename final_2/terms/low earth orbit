The [[International Space Station]] conducts operations in LEO. The altitude record for a human spaceflight in LEO was [[Gemini 11]] with an [[Apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|1374.1|km|mi|sp=us}}.  All manned [[space station]]s to date, as well as the majority of [[satellite]]s, have been in LEO.\n\n==Orbital characteristics==\nObjects in LEO encounter atmospheric drag from [[gases]] in the [[thermosphere]] (approximately 80\u2013500&nbsp;km up) or [[exosphere]] (approximately 500&nbsp;km and up), depending on orbit height. Due to atmospheric drag, satellites do not usually orbit below 300 km. Objects in LEO orbit Earth between the denser part of the atmosphere and below the inner [[Van Allen radiation belt]].\n\nThe orbital velocity needed to maintain a stable low Earth orbit is about 7.8&nbsp;km/s, but reduces with increased orbital altitude. Calculated for circular orbit of 200&nbsp;km it is 7.79&nbsp;km/s and for 1500&nbsp;km it is 7.12&nbsp;km/s.<ref>{{Cite web|title = LEO parameters|url = http://www.spaceacademy.net.au/watch/track/leopars.htm|website = www.spaceacademy.net.au|accessdate = 2015-06-12}}</ref> The [[delta-v]] needed to achieve low Earth orbit starts around 9.4&nbsp;km/s.

These orbits, with low inclination to the Equator, allow rapid revisit times and have the lowest [[delta-v]] requirement (i.e., fuel spend) of any orbit. Orbits with a high inclination angle to the equator are usually called [[polar orbit]]s.\n\nHigher orbits include [[medium Earth orbit]] (MEO), sometimes called intermediate circular orbit (ICO), and further above, [[geostationary orbit]] (GEO). Orbits higher than low orbit can lead to early failure of electronic components due to intense [[radiation]] and charge accumulation.\n\n==Use of LEO==\n[[File:Sunrise To Sunset Aboard The ISS.OGG|thumb|Roughly half an orbit of the [[International Space Station|ISS]].]]\n\nAlthough the Earth's pull due to [[gravity]] in LEO is not much less than on the surface of the Earth, people and objects in orbit experience [[weightlessness]] because they are in free fall.\n\nA low Earth orbit is simplest and cheapest for satellite placement.  It provides high bandwidth and low communication time lag ([[latency (engineering)|latency]]), but satellites in LEO will not be visible from any given point on the Earth at all times.<ref>{{Cite web|title = High Throughput Satellite Communications Systems: MEO vs. LEO vs. GEO {{!}} The Link|url = http://www.harriscaprock.com/blog/high-throughput-satellite-communications-systems-meo-vs-leo-vs-geo/|website = www.harriscaprock.com|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}</ref>\n\n===Examples===\n* [[Earth observation satellite]]s and [[spy satellite]]s use LEO as they are able to see the surface of the Earth more clearly as they are not so far away. They are also able to traverse the surface of the Earth. A majority of artificial [[satellite]]s are placed in LEO,<ref>{{Cite web|title = NASA Earth Observatory :|url = http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/OrbitsCatalog/|website = earthobservatory.nasa.gov|date = 2009-09-04|accessdate = 2015-11-28|language = en|first = Riebeek,|last = Holli}}</ref> making one complete revolution around the [[Earth]] in about 90 minutes.\n* The [[International Space Station]] is in a LEO about {{convert|400|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} above the Earth's surface.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition26/iss_altitude.html | title=Higher Altitude Improves Station's Fuel Economy | publisher=NASA | accessdate=2013-02-12}}</ref>\n* Since it requires less energy to place a satellite into a LEO and the LEO satellite needs less powerful amplifiers for successful transmission, LEO is still used for many communication applications. Because these LEO orbits are not geostationary, a network (or \"[[Satellite constellation|constellation]]\") of satellites is required to provide continuous coverage. (Many [[communication satellite]]s require [[geostationary orbit]]s, and move at the same angular velocity as the Earth. Some communications satellites including the [[Iridium Communications|Iridium phone system]] use LEO.)\n* Lower orbits also aid [[remote sensing]] satellites because of the added detail that can be gained. Remote sensing satellites can also take advantage of [[Sun-synchronous orbit|sun-synchronous LEO orbits]] at an altitude of about {{convert|800|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} and near polar inclination. [[Envisat]] is one example of an Earth observation satellite that makes use of this particular type of LEO.\n\n==Space debris==\nThe LEO environment is becoming congested with [[space debris]] due to the frequency of object launches.  This has caused growing concern in recent years, since collisions at orbital velocities can easily be dangerous, and even deadly. Collisions can produce even more space debris in the process, creating a [[domino effect]], something known as [[Kessler Syndrome]]. The [[Joint Space Operations Center]], part of [[United States Strategic Command]] (formerly the United States Space Command), currently tracks more than 8,500 objects larger than 10&nbsp;cm in LEO.<ref>[http://www.vandenberg.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=12579 Fact Sheet: Joint Space Operations Center]</ref>  However, a limited [[Arecibo Observatory]] study suggested there could be approximately one million objects larger than 2 millimeters,<ref>[http://www.astronomycafe.net/qadir/q1697.html archive of astronomy: space junk]</ref> which are too small to be visible from Earth-based observatories.<ref>[http://eugen.leitl.org/tt/msg04534.html ISS laser broom, project Orion]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight|Astronomy|Solar System|Space}}\n* [[List of orbits]]\n* [[Medium Earth orbit]] (MEO)\n* [[High Earth orbit]] (HEO)\n* [[Highly elliptical orbit]] (HEO)\n* [[Geostationary]] orbit  (GEO)\n* [[Specific orbital energy#Examples|Specific orbital energy examples]]\n* [[Suborbital spaceflight]]\n* [[Atmosphere of Earth]]\n* [[Heavy lift launch vehicle]] \n* [[Medium-lift launch vehicle]]\n* [[Comparison of orbital launch systems]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Include-NASA}}\n\n{{orbits}}\n{{People currently in space}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Low Earth Orbit}}\n[[Category:Earth orbits]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]"}]}}}}
