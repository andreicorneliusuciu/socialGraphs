He presented a slightly more complex equation than the one above (see [[#History|History]] section below) to explain his experimental results.  The above equation is the modern form of Ohm's law.\n\nIn physics, the term ''Ohm's law'' is also used to refer to various generalizations of the law originally formulated by Ohm.  The simplest example of this is:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma \\mathbf{E},</math>\n\nwhere '''''J''''' is the [[current density]] at a given location in a resistive material, '''''E''''' is the electric field at that location, and ''\u03c3'' ([[Sigma]]) is a material-dependent parameter called the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]].

Cavendish wrote that the \"velocity\" (current) varied directly as the \"degree of electrification\" (voltage).

For experiments, he initially used [[voltaic pile]]s, but later used a [[thermocouple]] as this provided a more stable voltage source in terms of internal resistance and constant voltage.  He used a galvanometer to measure current, and knew that the voltage between the thermocouple terminals was proportional to the junction temperature.  He then added test wires of varying length, diameter, and material to complete the circuit.  He found that his data could be modeled through the equation\n:<math>x = \\frac{a}{b + l},</math>\nwhere ''x'' was the reading from the [[galvanometer]], ''l'' was the length of the test conductor, ''a'' depended only on the thermocouple junction temperature, and ''b'' was a constant of the entire setup.  From this, Ohm determined his law of proportionality and published his results.\n\nOhm's law was probably the most important of the early quantitative descriptions of the physics of electricity.  We consider it almost obvious today. When Ohm first published his work, this was not the case; critics reacted to his treatment of the subject with hostility.  They called his work a \"web of naked fancies\"<ref>\nDavies, B, \"A web of naked fancies?\", ''Physics Education'' 15 57\u201361, Institute of Physics, Issue 1, Jan 1980 [http://www.iop.org/EJ/S/UNREG/an0VsEw7ynSY0UzIRNaNVQ/abstract/0031-9120/15/1/314]\n</ref> and the German Minister of Education proclaimed that \"a professor who preached such heresies was unworthy to teach science.\"<ref>Hart, IB, ''Makers of Science'', London, Oxford University Press, 1923. p. 243.

These factors hindered the acceptance of Ohm's work, and his work did not become widely accepted until the 1840s.  Fortunately, Ohm received recognition for his contributions to science well before he died.\n\nIn the 1850s, Ohm's law was known as such and was widely considered proved, and alternatives, such as \"[[Barlow's law]]\", were discredited, in terms of real applications to telegraph system design, as discussed by [[Samuel F. B. Morse]] in 1855.<ref>{{cite book | title = Shaffner's Telegraph Companion: Devoted to the Science and Art of the Morse Telegraph | author = Taliaferro Preston | authorlink = Taliaferro Preston Shaffner | publisher = Pudney & Russell | volume = Vol.2 | year = 1855 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TDEOAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA43&dq=ohm%27s-law+date:0-1860 }}</ref>\n\nWhile the old term for electrical conductance, the [[Siemens (unit)|mho]] (the inverse of the resistance unit ohm), is still used, a new name, the [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]], was adopted in 1971, honoring [[Ernst Werner von Siemens]].  The siemens is preferred in formal papers.\n\nIn the 1920s, it was discovered that the current through a practical resistor actually has statistical fluctuations, which depend on temperature, even when voltage and resistance are exactly constant; this fluctuation, now known as [[Johnson\u2013Nyquist noise]], is due to the discrete nature of charge.  This thermal effect implies that measurements of current and voltage that are taken over sufficiently short periods of time will yield ratios of V/I that fluctuate from the value of R implied by the time average or [[ensemble average]] of the measured current; Ohm's law remains correct for the average current, in the case of ordinary resistive materials.\n\nOhm's work long preceded [[Maxwell's equations]] and any understanding of frequency-dependent effects in AC circuits. Modern developments in electromagnetic theory and circuit theory do not contradict Ohm's law when they are evaluated within the appropriate limits.\n\n==Scope==\nOhm's law is an [[empirical law]], a generalization from many experiments that have shown that current is approximately proportional to electric field for most materials. It is less fundamental than [[Maxwell's equations]] and is not always obeyed. Any given material will [[electrical breakdown|break down]] under a strong-enough electric field, and some materials of interest in electrical engineering are \"non-ohmic\" under weak fields.<ref>{{Citation |last=Purcell |first=Edward M. |authorlink=Edward Mills Purcell |year=1985 |title=Electricity and magnetism |edition=2nd |series=Berkeley Physics Course |volume=2 |isbn=0-07-004908-4 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=129}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Griffiths |first=David J. |authorlink=David Griffiths (physicist) |year=1999 |title=Introduction to electrodynamics |edition=3rd |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-805326-X |page=289}}</ref>\n\nOhm's law has been observed on a wide range of length scales.

Electrons will be accelerated in the opposite direction to the electric field by the average electric field at their location. With each collision, though, the electron is deflected in a random direction with a velocity that is much larger than the velocity gained by the electric field.  The net result is that electrons take a zigzag path due to the collisions, but generally drift in a direction opposing the electric field.\n\nThe [[drift velocity]] then determines the electric [[current density]] and its relationship to '''''E''''' and is independent of the collisions.  Drude calculated the average drift velocity from '''''p'''''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212''e'''E'''\u03c4'' where '''''p''''' is the average [[momentum]], \u2212''e'' is the charge of the electron and \u03c4 is the average time between the collisions.   Since both the momentum and the current density are proportional to the drift velocity, the current density becomes proportional to the applied electric field; this leads to Ohm's law.\n\n==Hydraulic analogy==\n\nA [[hydraulic analogy]] is sometimes used to describe Ohm's law.  Water pressure, measured by [[pascal (unit)|pascals]] (or [[pounds per square inch|PSI]]), is the analog of voltage because establishing a water pressure difference between two points along a (horizontal) pipe causes water to flow.  Water flow rate, as in [[liter]]s per second, is the analog of current, as in [[coulomb]]s per second. Finally, flow restrictors\u2014such as apertures placed in pipes between points where the water pressure is measured\u2014are the analog of resistors. We say that the rate of water flow through an aperture restrictor is proportional to the difference in water pressure across the restrictor. Similarly, the rate of flow of electrical charge, that is, the electric current, through an electrical resistor is proportional to the difference in voltage measured across the resistor.\n\nFlow and pressure variables can be calculated in fluid flow network with the use of the hydraulic ohm analogy.<ref>{{cite book |author1=A.

The line that divides the left and right sections indicate multiplication, and the divider between the top and bottom sections indicates division (hence the division bar).\n\n{{anchor|ohmic}}\n===Resistive circuits===\n\n[[Resistor]]s are circuit elements that impede the passage of electric charge in agreement with Ohm's law, and are designed to have a specific resistance value ''R''.  In a schematic diagram the resistor is shown as a zig-zag symbol.  An element (resistor or conductor) that behaves according to Ohm's law over some operating range is referred to as an ''ohmic device'' (or an ''ohmic resistor'') because Ohm's law and a single value for the resistance suffice to describe the behavior of the device over that range.\n\nOhm's law holds for circuits containing only resistive elements (no capacitances or inductances) for all forms of driving voltage or current, regardless of whether the driving voltage or current is constant ([[direct current|DC]]) or time-varying such as [[alternating current|AC]].  At any instant of time Ohm's law is valid for such circuits.\n\nResistors which are in ''[[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]]'' or in ''[[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]]'' may be grouped together into a single \"equivalent resistance\" in order to apply Ohm's law in analyzing the circuit.\n\n===Reactive circuits with time-varying signals===\n\nWhen reactive elements such as capacitors, inductors, or transmission lines are involved in a circuit to which AC or time-varying voltage or current is applied, the relationship between voltage and current becomes the solution to a [[differential equation]], so Ohm's law (as defined above) does not directly apply since that form contains only resistances having value R, not complex impedances which may contain capacitance (\"C\") or inductance (\"L\").\n\nEquations for [[time-invariant]] [[alternating current|AC]] circuits take the same form as Ohm's law. However, the variables are generalized to [[complex number]]s and the current and voltage waveforms are [[complex exponential]]s.<ref>{{cite book | title = Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering | author = Rajendra Prasad | publisher = Prentice-Hall of India | year = 2006 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nsmcbzOJU3kC&pg=PA140&dq=ohm%27s-law+complex+exponentials | isbn = 978-81-203-2729-0 }}</ref>\n\nIn this approach, a voltage or current waveform takes the form <math>Ae^{st}</math>, where ''t'' is time, ''s'' is a complex parameter, and ''A'' is a complex scalar.  In any [[LTI system theory|linear time-invariant system]], all of the currents and voltages can be expressed with the same ''s'' parameter as the input to the system, allowing the time-varying complex exponential term to be canceled out and the system described algebraically in terms of the complex scalars in the current and voltage waveforms.\n\nThe complex generalization of resistance is [[electrical impedance|impedance]], usually denoted ''Z''; it can be shown that for an inductor,\n\n:<math>Z = sL\\,</math>\n\nand for a capacitor,\n\n:<math>Z = \\frac{1}{sC}.</math>\n\nWe can now write,\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{V} = \\boldsymbol{I} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{Z}</math>\n\nwhere '''''V''''' and '''''I''''' are the complex scalars in the voltage and current respectively and '''''Z''''' is the complex impedance.\n\nThis form of Ohm's law, with ''Z'' taking the place of ''R'', generalizes the simpler form.  When ''Z'' is complex, only the real part is responsible for dissipating heat.\n\nIn the general AC circuit, ''Z'' varies strongly with the frequency parameter ''s'', and so also will the relationship between voltage and current.\n\nFor the common case of a steady [[Sine wave|sinusoid]], the ''s'' parameter is taken to be <math>j\\omega</math>, corresponding to a complex sinusoid <math>Ae^{\\mbox{ } j \\omega t}</math>.  The real parts of such complex current and voltage waveforms describe the actual sinusoidal currents and voltages in a circuit, which can be in different phases due to the different complex scalars.\n\n===Linear approximations===\n\n{{See also|Small-signal modeling|Network analysis (electrical circuits)#Small signal equivalent circuit}}\n\nOhm's law is one of the basic equations used in the [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|analysis of electrical circuits]].  It applies to both metal conductors and circuit components ([[resistor]]s) specifically made for this behaviour.  Both are ubiquitous in electrical engineering.  Materials and components that obey Ohm's law are described as \"ohmic\" <ref>Hughes, E, ''Electrical Technology'', pp10, Longmans, 1969.</ref> which means they produce the same value for resistance (R = V/I) regardless of the value of V or I which is applied and whether the applied voltage or current is DC ([[direct current]]) of either positive or negative polarity or AC ([[alternating current]]).\n\nIn a true ohmic device, the same value of resistance will be calculated from R = V/I regardless of the value of the applied voltage V.  That is, the ratio of V/I is constant, and when current is plotted as a function of voltage the curve is ''linear'' (a straight line).  If voltage is forced to some value V, then that voltage V divided by measured current I will equal R.  Or if the current is forced to some value I, then the measured voltage V divided by that current I is also R.  Since the plot of I versus V is a straight line, then it is also true that for any set of two different voltages V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> applied across a given device of resistance R, producing currents I<sub>1</sub> = V<sub>1</sub>/R and I<sub>2</sub> = V<sub>2</sub>/R, that the ratio (V<sub>1</sub>-V<sub>2</sub>)/(I<sub>1</sub>-I<sub>2</sub>) is also a constant equal to R.  The operator \"delta\" (\u0394) is used to represent a difference in a quantity, so we can write \u0394V = V<sub>1</sub>-V<sub>2</sub> and \u0394I = I<sub>1</sub>-I<sub>2</sub>.  Summarizing, for any truly ohmic device having resistance R, V/I = \u0394V/\u0394I = R for any applied voltage or current or for the difference between any set of applied voltages or currents.\n\n[[File:FourIVcurves.svg|thumb|400px|The [[I\u2013V curve]]s of four devices: Two [[resistor]]s, a [[diode]], and a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. The two resistors follow Ohm's law: The plot is a straight line through the origin. The other two devices do ''not'' follow Ohm's law.]]\n\nThere are, however, components of electrical circuits which do not obey Ohm's law; that is, their relationship between current and voltage (their [[I\u2013V curve]]) is ''nonlinear'' (or non-ohmic).  An example is the [[Diode#Shockley diode equation|p-n junction diode]] (curve at right).  As seen in the figure, the current does not increase linearly with applied voltage for a diode.  One can determine a value of current (I) for a given value of applied voltage (V) from the curve, but not from Ohm's law, since the value of \"resistance\" is not constant as a function of applied voltage.  Further, the current only increases significantly if the applied voltage is positive, not negative.  The ratio ''V''/''I'' for some point along the nonlinear curve is sometimes called the ''static'', or ''chordal'', or [[direct current|DC]], resistance,<ref>{{cite book | title = Engineering System Dynamics | author = Forbes T.

This means the \"DC resistance\" V/I at some point on the curve is not the same as what would be determined by applying an AC signal having peak amplitude \u0394V volts or \u0394I amps centered at that same point along the curve and measuring \u0394V/\u0394I. However, in some diode applications, the AC signal applied to the device is small and it is possible to analyze the circuit in terms of the ''dynamic'', ''small-signal'', or ''incremental'' resistance, defined as the one over the slope of the V\u2013I curve at the average value (DC operating point) of the voltage (that is, one over the [[derivative]] of current with respect to voltage).  For sufficiently small signals, the dynamic resistance allows the Ohm's law small signal resistance to be calculated as approximately one over the slope of a line drawn tangentially to the V-I curve at the DC operating point.<ref name=horowitz-hill>{{cite book |last=Horowitz |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Horowitz |author2=[[Winfield Hill]] | title=The Art of Electronics |edition=2nd |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-37095-7 |page = 13 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bkOMDgwFA28C&pg=PA13&dq=small-signal+%22dynamic+resistance%22 }}</ref>\n\n==Temperature effects==\n\nOhm's law has sometimes been stated as, \"for a conductor in a given state, the electromotive force is proportional to the current produced.\"  That is, that the resistance, the ratio of the applied [[electromotive force]] (or voltage) to the current, \"does not vary with the current strength .\"  The qualifier \"in a given state\" is usually interpreted as meaning \"at a constant temperature,\" since the resistivity of materials is usually temperature dependent. Because the conduction of current is related to [[Joule heating]] of the conducting body, according to [[Joule's first law]], the temperature of a conducting body may change when it carries a current.  The dependence of resistance on temperature therefore makes resistance depend upon the current in a typical experimental setup, making the law in this form difficult to directly verify.  [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] and others worked out several methods to test the law experimentally in 1876, controlling for heating effects.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | journal = Nature\n | volume = 14\n | title = Reports\n | editor = Normal Lockyer\n | publisher = Macmillan Journals Ltd\n | date = September 21, 1876\n | pages = 451\u20139 [452]\n | doi = 10.1038/014451a0\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-8gKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA452&dq=ohm%27s-law+temperature&q=ohm's-law%20temperature\n |bibcode = 1876Natur..14..451. }}</ref>\n\n==Relation to heat conductions==\n{{See also|Conduction (heat)}}\nOhm's principle predicts the flow of electrical charge (i.e. current) in electrical conductors when subjected to the influence of voltage differences; [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier|Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Fourier]]'s principle predicts the flow of [[heat]] in heat conductors when subjected to the influence of temperature differences.\n\nThe same equation describes both phenomena, the equation's variables taking on different meanings in the two cases. Specifically, solving a heat conduction (Fourier) problem with ''[[temperature]]'' (the driving \"force\") and ''[[flux|flux of heat]]'' (the rate of flow of the driven \"quantity\", i.e. heat energy) variables also solves an analogous [[electrical conduction]] (Ohm) problem having ''[[electric potential]]'' (the driving \"force\") and ''[[electric current]]'' (the rate of flow of the driven \"quantity\", i.e. charge) variables.\n\nThe basis of Fourier's work was his clear conception and definition of [[thermal conductivity]]. He assumed that, all else being the same, the flux of heat is strictly proportional to the gradient of temperature. Although undoubtedly true for small temperature gradients, strictly proportional behavior will be lost when real materials (e.g. ones having a thermal conductivity that is a function of temperature) are subjected to large temperature gradients.\n\nA similar assumption is made in the statement of Ohm's law: other things being alike, the strength of the current at each point is proportional to the gradient of electric potential. The accuracy of the assumption that flow is proportional to the gradient is more readily tested, using modern measurement methods, for the electrical case than for the heat case.\n\n==Other versions==\n\nOhm's law, in the form above, is an extremely useful equation in the field of electrical/electronic engineering because it describes how voltage, current and resistance are interrelated on a \"macroscopic\" level, that is, commonly, as circuit elements in an [[electrical circuit]]. Physicists who study the electrical properties of matter at the microscopic level use a closely related and more general [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] equation, sometimes also referred to as Ohm's law, having variables that are closely related to the V, I, and R [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] variables of Ohm's law, but which are each functions of position within the conductor.  Physicists often use this continuum form of Ohm's Law:<ref>{{cite book\n | title = Physics for scientists and engineers\n | author = Lerner, Lawrence S.\n | publisher = Jones & Bartlett\n | year = 1977\n | isbn = 978-0-7637-0460-5\n | page = 736\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Nv5GAyAdijoC&pg=PA736\n }}</ref>\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{E} = \\rho \\mathbf{J}\n</math>\n\nwhere \"'''E'''\" is the [[electric field]] vector with units of volts per meter (analogous to \"V\" of Ohm's law which has units of volts), \"'''J'''\" is the [[current density]] vector with units of amperes per unit area (analogous to \"I\" of Ohm's law which has units of amperes), and \"\u03c1\" (Greek \"rho\") is the [[resistivity]] with units of ohm\u00b7meters (analogous to \"R\" of Ohm's law which has units of ohms).  The above equation is sometimes written<ref>Seymour J, ''Physical Electronics'', Pitman, 1972, pp 53\u201354</ref> as '''J''' = <math>\\sigma</math>'''E''' where \"\u03c3\" (Greek \"sigma\") is the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] which is the reciprocal of \u03c1.\n\n[[File:Ohms law vectors.svg|thumb|290px|Current flowing through a uniform cylindrical conductor (such as a round wire) with a uniform field applied.]]\nThe voltage between two points is defined as:<ref>Lerner L, ''Physics for scientists and engineers'', Jones & Bartlett, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nv5GAyAdijoC&pg=PA685 pp. 685\u2013686]</ref>\n\n:<math>{\\Delta V} = -\\int {\\mathbf E \\cdot d \\mathbf l} </math>\n\nwith <math>d \\mathbf l</math> the element of path along the integration of electric field vector '''E'''. If the applied '''E''' field is uniform and oriented along the length of the conductor as shown in the figure, then defining the voltage V in the usual convention of being opposite in direction to the field (see figure), and with the understanding that the voltage V is measured differentially across the length of the conductor allowing us to drop the \u0394 symbol, the above vector equation reduces to the scalar equation:\n\n:<math>V = {E}{l}  \\ \\  \\text{or} \\ \\ E = \\frac{V}{l}. </math>\n\nSince the '''E''' field is uniform in the direction of wire length, for a conductor having uniformly consistent resistivity \u03c1, the current density '''J''' will also be uniform in any cross-sectional area and oriented in the direction of wire length, so we may write:<ref name=lerner732>Lerner L, ''Physics for scientists and engineers'', Jones & Bartlett, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nv5GAyAdijoC&pg=PA732 pp. 732\u2013733]</ref>\n\n:<math> J = \\frac{I}{a}.</math>\n\nSubstituting the above 2 results (for ''E'' and ''J'' respectively) into the continuum form shown at the beginning of this section:\n\n:<math>\\frac{V}{l} = \\frac{I}{a}\\rho \\qquad \\text{or} \\qquad V = I \\rho \\frac{l}{a}.</math>\n\nThe [[electrical resistance]] of a uniform conductor is given in terms of [[resistivity]] by:<ref name=lerner732/>\n:<math>{R} = \\rho \\frac{l}{a} </math>\nwhere ''l'' is the length of the conductor in [[International System of Units|SI]] units of meters, ''a'' is the cross-sectional area (for a round wire ''a'' = ''\u03c0r''<sup>2</sup> if ''r'' is radius) in units of meters squared, and \u03c1 is the resistivity in units of ohm\u00b7meters.\n\nAfter substitution of ''R'' from the above equation into the equation preceding it, the continuum form of Ohm's law for a uniform field (and uniform current density) oriented along the length of the conductor reduces to the more familiar form:\n:<math>{V}={I}{R}. \\ </math>\n\nA perfect crystal lattice, with low enough thermal motion and no deviations from periodic structure, would have no [[resistivity]],<ref>Seymour J, ''Physical Electronics'', pp 48\u201349, Pitman, 1972</ref> but a real metal has [[crystallographic defect]]s, impurities, multiple [[isotope]]s, and thermal motion of the atoms. Electrons [[scattering|scatter]] from all of these, resulting in resistance to their flow.\n\nThe more complex generalized forms of Ohm's law are important to [[condensed matter physics]], which studies the properties of [[matter]] and, in particular, its [[electronic structure]]. In broad terms, they fall under the topic of [[constitutive equations]] and the theory of [[Green\u2013Kubo relations|transport coefficients]].\n\n===Magnetic effects===\nIf an external '''B'''-field is present and the conductor is not at rest but moving at velocity '''v''', then an extra term must be added to account for the current induced by the [[Lorentz force]] on the charge carriers.\n:<math>\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma (\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B})</math>\n\nIn the [[rest frame]] of the moving conductor this term drops out because '''v'''= 0. There is no contradiction because the electric field in the rest frame differs from the '''E'''-field in the lab frame: '''E''' ' = '''E''' + '''v'''\u00d7'''B'''.\nElectric and magnetic fields are relative, see [[Lorentz transformation]].\n\nIf the current '''J''' is alternating because the applied voltage or '''E'''-field varies in time, then reactance must be added to resistance to account for self-inductance, see [[electrical impedance]]. The reactance may be strong if the frequency is high or the conductor is coiled.\n\n===Conductive fluids===\nIn a conductive fluid, such as a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], there is a similar effect. Consider a fluid moving with the velocity <math>\\vec{v}</math> in a magnetic field <math>\\vec{B}</math>. The relative motion induces an electric field <math>\\vec{E}</math> which exerts [[electric force]] on the charged particles giving rise to an [[electric current]] <math>\\vec{J}</math>. The equation of motion for the electron gas, with a [[number density]]<math>n_e</math>, is written as\n\n:<math> m_en_e{d\\vec{v}_e\\over dt}=-n_e e \\vec{E}+ n_e m_e \\nu (v_i-v_e)-en_e\\vec{v}_e\\times \\vec{B}, </math>\n\nwhere <math>e</math>, <math>m_e</math> and <math>\\vec{v}_e</math> are the charge, mass and velocity of the electrons, respectively. Also, <math>\\nu</math> is the frequency of collisions of the electrons with ions which have a velocity field <math>\\vec{v}_i</math>. Since, the electron has a very small mass compared with that of ions, we can ignore the left hand side of the above equation to write\n\n:<math> \\sigma(\\vec{E}+\\vec{v}\\times \\vec{B})=\\vec{J}, </math>\n\nwhere we have used the definition of the [[current density]], and also put <math>\\sigma={n_e e^2\\over \\nu m_e}</math> which is the [[electrical conductivity]]. This equation can also be equivalently written as\n\n: <math> \\vec{E}+\\vec{v}\\times \\vec{B}=\\rho\\vec{J}, </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\rho=\\sigma^{-1}</math> is the [[electrical resistivity]]. It is also common to write <math>\\eta</math> instead of <math>\\rho</math> which can be confusing since it is the same notation used for the magnetic diffusivity defined as <math>\\eta=1/\\mu_0\\sigma</math>.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Fick's law of diffusion]]\n* [[Magnetic circuit#Hopkinson's law: the magnetic analogy to Ohm's law|Hopkinson's law]] (\"Ohm's law for magnetics\")\n* [[Maximum power transfer theorem]]\n* [[Norton's theorem]]\n* [[Sheet resistance]]\n* [[Superposition theorem]]\n* [[Thermal noise]]\n* [[Th\u00e9venin's theorem]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Ohm's law}}\n* [http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/DC/DC_2.html ''Ohm's Law''] chapter from [http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/DC/index.html ''Lessons In Electric Circuits Vol 1 DC''] book and [http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/ series].\n* John C.
