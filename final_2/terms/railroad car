Such cars, when coupled together and hauled by one or more [[locomotive]]s, form a [[train]]. Alternatively, some [[Passenger car (rail)|passenger cars]] are self-propelled in which case they may be either single [[railcar]]s or make up [[multiple unit]]s.\n\nThe term \"'''car'''\" is commonly used by itself in American English when a rail context is implicit. [[Indian English]] sometimes uses \"'''bogie'''\" in the same manner,<ref>[http://www.oxfordadvancedlearnersdictionary.com/dictionary/bogie Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary: bogie]</ref> though the term has [[bogie|other meanings]] in other variants of English.\n\nAlthough some cars exist for the railroad's own use \u2013 for [[Track (rail transport)#Track maintenance|track maintenance]] purposes, for example \u2013 most carry a revenue-earning load of passengers or freight, and may be classified accordingly as [[passenger car (rail)|passenger car]]s or [[Coach (rail)|coaches]] on the one hand or [[freight car]]s (or ''wagons'') on the other.\n\n== Passenger cars ==\n{{main|Passenger car (rail)}}\n\n[[Passenger car (rail)|Passenger car]]s, or [[Coach (rail)|coaches]], vary in their internal fittings:\n\nIn [[standard-gauge]] cars, seating is usually configured into ranges of between three and five seats across the width of the car, with an aisle in between (resulting in arrangements of 2+1, 2+2 or 3+2 seats) or at the side. Tables may be provided between seats facing one another. Alternatively, seats facing in the same direction may have access to a fold-down ledge on the back of the seat in front.\n\n* If the aisle is located between seats, seat rows may face the same direction, or be grouped, with twin rows facing each other.\n* In some vehicles intended for commuter services, seats are positioned with their backs to the side walls, either on one side or more commonly on both, facing each other across the aisle. This gives a wide accessway and allows room for [[standing passenger]]s at peak times, as well as improving loading and unloading speeds.\n* If the aisle is at the side, the car is usually divided into small compartments. These usually contain six seats, although sometimes in second class they contain eight, and sometimes in first class they contain four.\n\nPassenger cars can take the electricity supply for heating and lighting equipment from either of two main sources: directly from a [[head end power]] generator on the [[locomotive]] via bus cables, or by an axle-powered generator which continuously charges batteries whenever the train is in motion.\n\nModern cars usually have either [[air-conditioning]] or windows that can be opened (sometimes, for safety, not so far that one can hang out), or sometimes both. Various types of [[Passenger train toilets|onboard train toilet]] facilities may also be provided.\n\nOther types of passenger car exist, especially for long journeys, such as the [[dining car]], [[parlor car]], [[disco]] car, and in rare cases [[theater]] and [[movie theater]] car. In some cases another type of car is temporarily converted to one of these for an event.\n\n[[Observation car]]s were built for the rear of many famous trains to allow the passengers to view the scenery. These proved popular, leading to the development of [[dome car]]s multiple units of which could be placed mid-train, and featured a glass-enclosed upper level extending above the normal roof to provide passengers with a better view.\n\n[[Sleeping car]]s outfitted with (generally) small bedrooms allow passengers to sleep through their night-time trips, while [[couchette car]]s provide more basic sleeping accommodation.  Long-distance trains often require [[baggage car]]s for the passengers' luggage. In European practice it used to be common for day coaches to be formed of compartments seating 6 or 8 passengers, with access from a side corridor. In the UK, Corridor coaches fell into disfavor in the 1960s and 1970s partially because open coaches are considered more secure by women traveling alone.\n\nAnother distinction is between single- and double deck [[bilevel rail car|train]] cars. An example of a [[Bilevel car|double decker]] is the [[Superliner (railcar)|Amtrak superliner]].\n\nA \"trainset\" (or \"set\") is a semi-permanently arranged formation of cars, rather than one created \"ad hoc\" out of whatever cars are available. These are only broken up and reshuffled 'on shed' (in the maintenance depot). Trains are then built of one or more of these 'sets' coupled together as needed for the capacity of that train.\n\nOften, but not always, passenger cars in a train are linked together with enclosed, flexible gangway connections through which passengers and crewmen can walk. Some designs incorporate semi-permanent connections between cars and may have a full-width connection, effectively making them one long, articulated 'car'. In North America, passenger cars also employ [[tightlock coupling]]s to keep a train together in the event of a derailment or other accident.\n\nMany [[multiple unit]] trains consist of cars which are semi-permanently coupled into sets: these sets may be joined together to form larger trains, but generally passengers can only move around between cars within a set.  This \"closed\" arrangement keeps parties of travellers and their luggage together, and hence allows the separate sets to be easily split to go separate ways.  Some multiple-unit trainsets are designed so that corridor connections can be easily opened between coupled sets; this generally requires driving cabs either set to the side or (as in the Dutch ''[[Trains in the Netherlands|Koploper]]'') above the passenger compartment. These cabs or [[driving trailers]] are also useful for quickly reversing the train.\n\n== Freight cars ==\n{{main|Goods wagon}}\n{{further|Rail freight transport}}\n{{Incomplete|section|date=May 2014}}\n{{expand section|date=May 2014}}\n\n=== Types of freight cars ===\nFreight cars (US), [[goods wagon]]s (UIC), or trucks (UK) exist in a wide variety of types, adapted to carry of a host of goods. Originally there were very few types of cars; the flat car or wagon, and the [[boxcar]] (US/Canada), [[covered goods wagon|covered wagon]] (UIC) or van (UK), were among the first.  Freight cars or goods wagons are generally categorized as follows:\n* [[Boxcar]] (US/Canada), [[Covered goods wagon|covered wagon]] ([[International Union of Railways|UIC]]) or van (UIC): fully enclosed car with side or end doors.\n** [[Covered goods wagon|Covered wagon]] (UIC), van (UIC) or [[boxcar]] (US/Canada): fully enclosed wagon for moisture-susceptible goods.\n** [[Boxcar#Hicube boxcar|Hicube boxcars]]: high capacity high clearance boxcar.\n** [[Refrigerator car]] or Reefer (US/Canada): refrigerated boxcar for fruits and vegetables.\n* [[CargoBeamer]]\n* [[CargoSprinter]]: self-propelled container flat.\n* [[Coil car]]: specialized flat or gondola for heavy sheet metal rolls.\n* [[Combine car]]: combined [[Passenger car (rail)|passenger car]] and [[boxcar]] in one wagon. \n* [[Covered hopper]]: specialized hopper car with a cover for weather sensitive loads (grain, pellets,...)\n* [[Flatcar]] (or ''flat''): for larger bulky loads.
