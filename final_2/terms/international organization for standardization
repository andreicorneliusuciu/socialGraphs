It is the world's largest developer of voluntary international standards and facilitates world trade by providing common standards between nations. Nearly twenty thousand standards have been set covering everything from manufactured products and technology to food safety, agriculture and healthcare.<ref name=\"About_ISO\"/>\n\nUse of the standards aids in the creation of products and services that are safe, reliable and of good quality. The standards help businesses increase productivity while minimizing errors and waste. By enabling products from different markets to be directly compared, they facilitate companies in entering new markets and assist in the development of global trade on a fair basis. The standards also serve to safeguard consumers and the end-users of products and services, ensuring that certified products conform to the minimum standards set internationally.<ref name=\"About_ISO\"/>\n\n== Name and abbreviations ==\n\nThe three official languages of the ISO are [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[Russian language|Russian]].<ref name=\"languages\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/how_to_use_the_catalogue.htm |title=How to use the ISO Catalogue |publisher=ISO.org |deadurl=no |archivedate=4 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004225623/http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/how_to_use_the_catalogue.htm}}</ref> The name of the organization in French is ''Organisation internationale de normalisation'', and in Russian, ''\u041c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438''.

ISO/IEC directives allow also the so-called \"Fast-track procedure\". In this procedure a document is submitted directly for approval as a draft International Standard (DIS) to the ISO member bodies or as a final draft International Standard (FDIS) if the document was developed by an international standardizing body recognized by the ISO Council.<ref name=\"iso-stages\"/>\n\nThe first step\u2014a proposal of work (New Proposal) is approved at the relevant subcommittee or technical committee (e.g.,&nbsp;SC29 and JTC1 respectively in the case of [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] - ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11). A working group (WG) of experts is set up by the TC/SC for the preparation of a working draft. When the scope of a new work is sufficiently clarified, some of the working groups (e.g.,&nbsp;MPEG) usually make open request for proposals\u2014known as a \"call for proposals\". The first document that is produced for example for audio and video coding standards is called a verification model&nbsp;(VM) (previously also called a \"simulation and test model\"). When a sufficient confidence in the stability of the standard under development is reached, a working draft&nbsp;(WD) is produced. This is in the form of a standard but is kept internal to working group for revision. When a working draft is sufficiently solid and the working group is satisfied that it has developed the best technical solution to the problem being addressed, it becomes committee draft&nbsp;(CD). If it is required, it is then sent to the P-members of the TC/SC (national bodies) for ballot.\n\nThe CD becomes final committee draft (FCD) if the number of positive votes is above the quorum. Successive committee drafts may be considered until consensus is reached on the technical content. When it is reached, the text is finalized for submission as a draft International Standard (DIS). The text is then submitted to national bodies for voting and comment within a period of five months. It is approved for submission as a final draft International Standard&nbsp;(FDIS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC are in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. ISO will then hold a ballot with National Bodies where no technical changes are allowed (yes/no ballot), within a period of two months. It is approved as an International Standard&nbsp;(IS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC is in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. After approval, only minor editorial changes are introduced into the final text. The final text is sent to the ISO Central Secretariat, which publishes it as the International Standard.<ref name=\"about-mpeg\"/><ref name=\"iso-stages\"/>\n\n== Products named after ISO ==\n\nThe fact that many of the ISO-created standards are ubiquitous has led, on occasion, to common use of \"ISO\" to describe the actual product that conforms to a standard. Some examples of this are:\n* Many [[CD image]]s end in the [[file extension]] \"[[ISO image|ISO]]\" to signify that they are using the [[ISO&nbsp;9660]] standard file system as opposed to another file system\u2014hence CD&nbsp;images are commonly referred to as \"ISOs\". Virtually all computers with [[CD-ROM]] drives that can read CDs use this standard. Some DVD-ROMs also use ISO&nbsp;9660 file systems.\n* Photographic film's sensitivity to light (its \"[[film speed]]\") is described by [[ISO&nbsp;6]], [[ISO&nbsp;2240]] and [[ISO&nbsp;5800]]. Hence, the film's speed is often referred to as by its ISO&nbsp;number.\n* As it was originally defined in ISO&nbsp;518, the flash [[hot shoe]] found on cameras is often called the \"ISO&nbsp;shoe\".\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nWith the exception of a small number of isolated standards,<ref name=\"FreelyAvailableStandards\">{{cite web|url=http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/|title=Freely Available Standards|date=1 February 2011|publisher=ISO|deadurl=no|archivedate=|archiveurl=}}</ref> ISO standards are normally not available free of charge, but for a purchase fee,<ref name=\"iso_shopFAQ\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/store/shopping_faqs.htm |title=Shopping FAQs |publisher=ISO |deadurl=no |archivedate=5 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005054552/http://www.iso.org/iso/store/shopping_faqs.htm}}</ref> which has been seen by some as too expensive for small [[open source]] projects.<ref name=\"oreilly2007\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/08/where_to_get_iso_standards_on.html |title=Where to get ISO Standards on the Internet free |publisher=oreillynet.com |last=Jelliffe |first=Rick |quote=''The lack of free online availability has effectively made ISO standard irrelevant to the (home/hacker section of the) Open Source community'' |date=1 August 2007 |deadurl=no |archivedate=24 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124060422/http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/08/where_to_get_iso_standards_on.html}}</ref>\n\nThe [[ISO/IEC JTC1]] fast-track procedures (\"Fast-track\" as used by [[Office Open XML|OOXML]] and \"PAS\" as used by [[OpenDocument]]) have garnered criticism in relation to the [[standardization of Office Open XML]] (ISO/IEC&nbsp;29500). Martin Bryan, outgoing Convenor of [[ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34]] WG1, is quoted as saying:\n\n<blockquote>\nI would recommend my successor that it is perhaps time to pass WG1\u2019s outstanding standards over to OASIS, where they can get approval in less than a year and then do a PAS submission to ISO, which will get a lot more attention and be approved much faster than standards currently can be within WG1.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nThe disparity of rules for PAS, Fast-Track and ISO committee generated standards is fast making ISO a laughing stock in IT circles. The days of open standards development are fast disappearing. Instead we are getting 'standardization by corporation'.<ref name=\"jtc1_sc34_0940\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jtc1sc34.org/repository/0940.htm |title=Report on WG1 activity for December 2007 Meeting of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG1 in Kyoto |publisher=iso/jtc1 sc34 |deadurl=no |archivedate=12 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812081252/http://www.jtc1sc34.org/repository/0940.htm}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nComputer security entrepreneur and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] investor, [[Mark Shuttleworth]], commented on the [[Standardization of Office Open XML]] process by saying \"I think it de-values the confidence people have in the standards setting process,\" and Shuttleworth alleged that ISO did not carry out its responsibility. He also noted that [[Microsoft]] had intensely lobbied many countries that traditionally had not participated in ISO and stacked technical committees with Microsoft employees, solution providers and resellers sympathetic to Office Open XML.\n\n<blockquote>\nWhen you have a process built on trust and when that trust is abused, ISO should halt the process... ISO is an engineering old boys club and these things are boring so you have to have a lot of passion \u2026 then suddenly you have an investment of a lot of money and lobbying and you get artificial results. The process is not set up to deal with intensive corporate [[lobbying]] and so you end up with something being a standard that is not clear.<ref name=\"zdnet_2222\">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2222 |title=Ubuntu\u2019s Shuttleworth blames ISO for OOXML\u2019s win |publisher=ZDNet.com |date=1 April 2008 |deadurl=no |archivedate=4 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404052723/http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2222}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns |colwidth=35.0em\n| col1 =\n* [[American National Standards Institute]]\n* [[AP Stylebook|AP {{smaller|(Associated Press)}} Stylebook]].\n* [[Brazilian National Standards Organization]]\n* [[Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung]], the German Institute for Standardization.\n* [[BSI Group]]\n* [[Bureau of Indian Standards]] \n* [[Canadian Standards Association]]\n* [[Countries in the International Organization for Standardization]]\n* [[European Committee for Standardization]]\n* [[GOST]], a set of technical standards maintained by the Euro-Asian Council for Standardization, Metrology and Certification.\n* [[Institute of Environmental Sciences and Technology]]\n* [[Interface 2010]], the Interface Marketing Supplier Integration Institute.\n* [[International Classification for Standards]]\n* [[International Electrotechnical Commission]]\n* [[International healthcare accreditation]]\n* [[IEEE Standards Association]]\n* [[International Telecommunication Union]]\n* [[List of International Organization for Standardization standards]]\n| col2 =\n* ISO divisions\n** [[ISO/TC 37]] \"Terminology and other language and content resources\", a fundamental ISO standardization committee.\n** [[ISO/TC 68]]\n** [[TC 46/SC 9]]\n** [[ISO/TC 211]]\n** [[ISO/TC 215]]\n** [[ISO/TC 223]]\n** [[ISO/TC 262]]\n** [[ISO/TC 292]]\n* [[Standardization]]\n* [[Standards Australia]]\n* [[Standards organization]]\n* [[Terminology planning policy]]\n* [[The International Customer Service Institute]]\n* [[Internet Engineering Task Force]]\n}}\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* [[JoAnne Yates]] and Craig N.
