It also supports [[animation]]s and allows a separate [[palette (computing)|palette]] of up to 256 colors for each frame. These palette limitations make the GIF format less suitable for reproducing color photographs and other images with continuous color, but it is well-suited for simpler images such as graphics or logos with solid areas of color.\n\nGIF images are compressed using the [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch]] (LZW) [[lossless data compression]] technique to reduce the file size without degrading the visual quality. This compression technique was patented in 1985. Controversy over the licensing agreement between the [[software patent]] holder, [[Unisys]], and CompuServe in 1994 spurred the development of the [[Portable Network Graphics]] (PNG) standard. By 2004 all the relevant patents had expired.\n\n==History==\n[[CompuServe]] introduced the GIF format in 1987 to provide a color image format for their file downloading areas, replacing their earlier [[run-length encoding]] (RLE) format, which was black and white only. GIF became popular because it used [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch|LZW data compression]], which was more efficient than the run-length encoding that formats such as [[PCX]] and [[MacPaint]] used, and fairly large images could therefore be downloaded in a reasonably short time, even with very slow [[modem]]s.\n\nThe original version of the GIF format was called '''87a'''.<ref name=\"87aSpec\" /> In 1989, CompuServe released an enhanced version, called '''89a''',<ref name=\"89aSpec\" /> which added support for animation delays (multiple images in a stream were already supported in 87a), transparent background colors, and storage of application-specific metadata. The 89a specification also supports incorporating text labels as text (not embedding them in the graphical data), but as there is little control over display fonts, this feature is not widely used. The two versions can be distinguished by looking at the first six [[byte]]s of the file (the \"[[Magic number (programming)|magic number]]\" or \"signature\"), which, when interpreted as [[ASCII]], read \"GIF87a\" and \"GIF89a\", respectively.\n\nCompuServe encouraged the adoption of GIF by providing downloadable conversion utilities for many computers. By December 1987, for example, an [[Apple IIGS]] user could view pictures created on an [[Atari ST]] or [[Commodore 64]].<ref name=\"caa198712\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/COMPUTEs_Apple_Applications_Vol._5_No._2_Issue_6_1987-12_COMPUTE_Publications_US#page/n11/mode/2up | title=Online Art | work=Compute!'s Apple Applications | date=December 1987 | accessdate=14 September 2016 | pages=10}}</ref> GIF was one of the first two image formats commonly used on Web sites, the other being the black-and-white [[XBM]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.\n\nIn September 1995 [[Netscape (web browser)#Release history|Netscape Navigator]] 2.0 added [[Animated GIF]] support.\n\nThe feature of storing multiple images in one file, accompanied by control data, is used extensively on the Web to produce simple [[computer animation|animations]]. The optional interlacing feature, which stores image scan lines out of order in such a fashion that even a partially downloaded image was somewhat recognizable, also helped GIF's popularity,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} as a user could abort the download if it was not what was required.\n\nAs a [[noun]], the word ''GIF'' is found in the newer editions of many dictionaries. In 2012, the American wing of the [[Oxford University Press]] recognized ''GIF'' as a [[verb]] as well, meaning \"to create a GIF file\", as in \"GIFing was perfect medium for sharing scenes from the [[Summer Olympics]]\". The press's lexicographers voted it their [[word of the year]], saying that GIFs have evolved into \"a tool with serious applications including research and journalism\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/press-releases/us-word-of-the-year-2012/ |title=Oxford Dictionaries USA Word of the Year 2012 |website= OxfordWords blog |publisher=Oxford American Dictionaries |date=2012-11-13 |accessdate=2013-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Flood |first=Alison |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2012/nov/14/gif-america-word-year-omnishambles |title=''Gif'' is America's word of the year?

One or more video sources can be edited, rearranged, or combined to create an absurd juxtaposition, to create the opposite effect intended by the creator of the original work, or to emphasize and exaggerate a minor detail.\n\n==File format==\n[[File:Empty GIF hex.png|thumb|[[:File:Empty.gif]] in a [[hex editor]]]]\nConceptually, a GIF file describes a fixed-sized graphical area (the \"logical screen\") populated with zero or more \"images\". Many GIF files have a single image that fills the entire logical screen. Others divide the logical screen into separate sub-images. The images may also function as animation frames in an animated GIF file, but again these need not fill the entire logical screen.\n\nGIF files start with a fixed-length header (\"GIF87a\" or \"GIF89a\") giving the version, followed by a fixed-length Logical Screen Descriptor giving the size and other characteristics of the logical screen. The screen descriptor may also specify the presence and size of a Global Color Table, which follows next if present.\n\nThereafter, the file is divided into segments, each introduced by a 1-byte sentinel:\n\n* An image (introduced by 0x2C, a comma <tt>','</tt>)\n* An extension block (introduced by 0x21, an exclamation point <tt>'!'</tt>)\n* The trailer (a single byte of value 0x3B, a semi-colon <tt>';'</tt>), which should be the last byte of the file.\n\nAn image starts with a fixed-length Image Descriptor, which may specify the presence and size of a Local Color Table (which follows next if present). The image data follows: one byte giving the bit width of the unencoded symbols (which must be at least 2 bits wide, even for bi-color images), followed by a linked list of sub-blocks containing the LZW-encoded data.\n\nExtension blocks (blocks that \"extend\" the 87a definition via a mechanism already defined in the 87a spec) consist of the sentinel, an additional byte specifying the type of extension, and a linked list of sub-blocks with the extension data. Extension blocks that modify an image (like the Graphic Control Extension that specifies the optional animation delay time and optional transparent background color) must immediately precede the segment with the image they refer to.\n\nThe linked lists used by the image data and the extension blocks consist of series of sub-blocks, each sub-block beginning with a byte giving the number of subsequent data bytes in the sub-block (1 to 255). The series of sub-blocks is terminated by an empty sub-block (a 0 byte).\n\nThis structure allows the file to be parsed even if not all parts are understood. A GIF marked 87a may contain extension blocks; the intent is that a decoder can read and display the file without the features covered in extensions it does not understand.\n\nThe full detail of the file format is covered in the GIF specification.<ref name=\"89aSpec\"/>\n\n==Palettes==\n[[File:Sunflower as gif websafe.gif|thumb|right|An example of a GIF image saved with a [[web-safe]] palette and dithered using the [[Floyd\u2013Steinberg dithering|Floyd\u2013Steinberg]] method. Due to the reduced number of colors in the image, there are display issues.]]\nGIF is palette-based: the colors used in an image (a frame) in the file have their [[RGB]] values defined in a [[Palette (computing)|palette table]] that can hold up to 256 entries, and the data for the image refer to the colors by their indices (0\u2013255) in the palette table. The color definitions in the palette can be drawn from a color space of millions of shades (2<sup>24</sup> shades, 8 bits for each primary), but the maximum number of colors a frame can use is 256. This limitation seemed reasonable when GIF was developed because few people could afford the hardware to display more colors simultaneously. Simple graphics, line drawings, cartoons, and grey-scale photographs typically need fewer than 256 colors.\n\nEach frame can designate one index as a \"transparent background color\": any pixel assigned this index takes on the color of the pixel in the same position from the background, which may have been determined by a previous frame of animation.\n\nMany techniques, collectively called [[dithering]], have been developed to approximate a wider range of colors with a small color palette by using pixels of two or more colors to approximate in-between colors. These techniques sacrifice spatial resolution to approximate deeper color resolution. While not part of the GIF specification, dithering can of course be used in images subsequently encoded as GIF images. This is often not an ideal solution for GIF images, both because the loss of spatial resolution typically makes an image look fuzzy on the screen, and because the dithering patterns often interfere with the compressibility of the image data, working against GIF's main purpose.\n\nIn the early days of graphical web browsers{{when|date=March 2015}}, graphics cards with 8-bit buffers (allowing only 256 colors) were common and it was fairly common to make GIF images using the [[Web-safe colors|websafe palette]].{{according_to_whom|date=March 2015}} This ensured predictable display, but severely limited the choice of colors. Now that 32-bit graphics cards, which support 24-bit color, are the norm{{update inline|date=March 2015}}, palettes can be populated with the optimum colors for individual images.\n\nA small color table may suffice for small images, and keeping the color table small allows the file to be downloaded faster. Both the 87a and 89a specifications allow color tables of 2<sup>''n''</sup> colors for any ''n'' from 1 through 8. Most graphics applications will read and display GIF images with any of these table sizes; but some do not support all sizes when ''creating'' images. Tables of 2, 16, and 256 colors are widely supported.\n\n===True color===\n[[File:SmallFullColourGIF.gif|thumb|right|210px|An animated GIF illustrating a technique for displaying more than the typical limit of 256 colors]]\nAlthough the GIF format is almost never used for [[True Color]] images, it is possible to do so.<ref name=aminet>{{cite web |url=http://uk.aminet.net/docs/misc/GIF24.readme |title=GIF 24 Bit (truecolor) extensions |author=Andreas Kleinert |year=2007 |accessdate=23 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316215949/http://uk.aminet.net/docs/misc/GIF24.readme |archive-date=16 March 2012}}</ref><ref name=philhoward>{{cite web |url=http://phil.ipal.org/tc.html |title=True-Color GIF Example |author=Philip Howard |accessdate=23 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222123613/http://phil.ipal.org/tc.html |archive-date=22 February 2015}}</ref> A GIF image can include multiple image blocks, each of which can have its own 256-color palette, and the blocks can be tiled to create a complete image. Alternatively, the GIF89a specification introduced the idea of a \"transparent\" color where each image block can include its own palette of 255 visible colors plus one transparent color. A complete image can be created by layering image blocks with the visible portion of each layer showing through the transparent portions of the layers above.\n\nTo render a full-color image as a GIF, the original image must be broken down into smaller regions having no more than 255 or 256 different colors. Each of these regions is then stored as a separate image block with its own local palette and when the image blocks are displayed together (either by tiling or by layering partially transparent image blocks) the complete, full-color image appears. For example, breaking an image into tiles of 16 by 16 pixels (256 pixels in total) ensures that no tile has more than the local palette limit of 256 colors, although larger tiles may be used and similar colors merged resulting in some loss of color information.<ref name=aminet />\n\nSince each image block requires its own local color table, a GIF file having lots of image blocks can be very large, limiting the usefulness of full-color GIFs.<ref name=philhoward /> Additionally, not all GIF rendering programs handle tiled or layered images correctly. Many rendering programs interpret tiles or layers as animation frames and display them in sequence as an endless animation<ref name=aminet /> with most web browsers automatically displaying the frames with a delay time of 0.1 seconds or more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nullsleep.tumblr.com/post/16524517190/animated-gif-minimum-frame-delay-browser-compatibility|title=Nullsleep - Jeremiah Johnson - Animated GIF Minimum Frame Delay Browser Compatibility Study|publisher=|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.fenrir-inc.com/us/2012/02/theyre-different-how-to-match-the-animation-rate-of-gif-files-accross-browsers.html|title=They're different!

The pixel codes typically don't match the 8-bit size of the bytes, so the codes are packed into bytes by a \"little-Endian\" scheme:  the least significant bit of the first code is stored in the least significant bit of the first byte, higher order bits of the code into higher order bits of the byte, spilling over into the low order bits of the next byte as necessary.  Each subsequent code is stored starting at the least significant bit not already used.\n\nThis byte stream is stored in the file as a series of \"sub-blocks\".  Each sub-block has a maximum length 255 bytes and is prefixed with a byte indicating the number of data bytes in the sub-block.  The series of sub-blocks is terminated by an empty sub-block (a single 0 byte, indicating a sub-block with 0 data bytes).\n\nFor the sample image above the reversible mapping between 9-bit codes and bytes is shown below.\n\n{| style=\"font-family:monospace; margin-left:2em\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n! 9-bit code<br/>(hex)\n!  style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\"| Binary\n!

A local string accumulates pixel color numbers from the palette, with no output action as long as the local string can be found in a code table. There is special treatment of the first two pixels that arrive before the table grows from its initial size by additions of strings. After each output code, the local string is initialized to the latest pixel color (that could not be included in the output code).\n<pre>\n                          Table           9-bit\n                     string --> code      code    Action\n                          #0 | 000h               Initialize root table of 9-bit codes\n                    palette  |  :\n                     colors  |  :\n                        #255 | 0FFh\n                         clr | 100h\n                         end | 101h\n                             |            100h     Clear\nPixel          Local         |\ncolor Palette  string        |\nBLACK  #40     28            |            028h     1st pixel always to output\nWHITE  #255    FF            |                     String found in table\n                  28 FF      | 102h                Always add 1st string to table\n               FF            |                     Initialize local string\nWHITE  #255    FF FF         |                     String not found in table\n                             |            0FFh     - output code for previous string\n                  FF FF      | 103h                - add latest string to table\n               FF            |                     - initialize local string\nWHITE  #255    FF FF         |                     String found in table\nBLACK  #40     FF FF 28      |                     String not found in table\n                             |            103h     - output code for previous string\n                  FF FF 28   | 104h                - add latest string to table\n               28            |                     - initialize local string\nWHITE  #255    28 FF         |                     String found in table\nWHITE  #255    28 FF FF      |                     String not found in table\n                             |            102h     - output code for previous string\n                  28 FF FF   | 105h                - add latest string to table\n               FF            |                     - initialize local string\nWHITE  #255    FF FF         |                     String found in table\nWHITE  #255    FF FF FF      |                     String not found in table\n                             |            103h     - output code for previous string\n                  FF FF FF   | 106h                - add latest string to table\n               FF            |                     - initialize local string\nWHITE  #255    FF FF         |                     String found in table\nWHITE  #255    FF FF FF      |                     String found in table\nWHITE  #255    FF FF FF FF   |                     String not found in table\n                             |            106h     - output code for previous string\n                  FF FF FF FF| 107h                - add latest string to table\n               FF            |                     - initialize local string\nWHITE  #255    FF FF         |                     String found in table\nWHITE  #255    FF FF FF      |                     String found in table\nWHITE  #255    FF FF FF FF   |                     String found in table\n                                                   No more pixels\n                                          107h     - output code for last string\n                                          101h     End\n</pre>\nFor clarity the table is shown above as being built of strings of increasing length. That scheme can function but the table consumes an unpredictable amount of memory. Memory can be saved in practice by noting that each new string to be stored consists of a previously stored string augmented by one character. It is economical to store at each address only two words: an existing address and one character.\n\nThe LZW algorithm requires a search of the table for each pixel. A linear search through up to 4096 addresses would make the coding slow. In practice the codes can be stored in order of numerical value; this allows each search to be done by a SAR (Successive Approximation Register, as used in some [[Successive approximation ADC|ADCs]]), with only 12 magnitude comparisons. For this efficiency an extra table is needed to convert between codes and actual memory addresses; the extra table upkeeping is needed only when a new code is stored which happens at much less than pixel rate.\n\n===Image decoding===\nDecoding begins by mapping the stored bytes back to 9-bit codes. These are decoded to recover the pixel colors as shown below. A table identical to the one used in the encoder is built by adding strings by this rule:\n Is incoming code found in table?\n  YES: add string for local code followed by first byte of string for incoming code\n  NO: add string for local code followed by copy of its own first byte\n<pre>\n      shift\n9-bit ----> Local      Table                 Pixel\ncode        code   code --> string   Palette color  Action\n100h               000h  | #0                       Initialize root table of 9-bit codes\n                    :    | palette\n                    :    | colors\n                   0FFh  | #255\n                   100h  | clr\n                   101h  | end\n028h                     |             #40    BLACK Decode 1st pixel\n0FFh        028h         |                           Incoming code found in table\n                         |             #255   WHITE  - output string from table\n                   102h  | 28 FF                     - add to table\n103h        0FFh         |                           Incoming code not found in table\n                   103h  | FF FF                     - add to table\n                         |                           - output string from table\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n102h        103h         |                           Incoming code found in table\n                         |                           - output string from table\n                         |             #40    BLACK\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n                   104h  | FF FF 28                  - add to table\n103h        102h         |                           Incoming code found in table\n                         |                           - output string from table\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n                   105h  | 28 FF FF                  - add to table\n106h        103h         |                           Incoming code not found in table\n                   106h  | FF FF FF                  - add to table\n                         |                           - output string from table\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n107h        106h         |                           Incoming code not found in table\n                   107h  | FF FF FF FF               - add to table\n                         |                           - output string from table\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n                         |             #255   WHITE\n101h                     |                           End\n\n</pre>\n\n===LZW code lengths===\nShorter code lengths can be used for palettes smaller than the 256 colors in the example. If the palette is only 64 colors (so color indexes are 6 bits wide), the symbols can range from 0 to 63, and the symbol width can be taken to be 6 bits, with codes starting at 7 bits. In fact, the symbol width need not match the palette size: as long as the values decoded are always less than the number of colors in the palette, the symbols can be any width from 2 to 8, and the palette size any power of 2 from 2 to 256. For example, if only the first four colors (values 0 to 3) of the palette are used, the symbols can be taken to be 2 bits wide with codes starting at 3 bits.\n\nConversely, the symbol width could be set at 8, even if only values 0 and 1 are used; these data would only require a 2-color table. Although there would be no point in encoding the file that way, something similar typically happens for bi-color images: the minimum symbol width is 2, even if only values 0 and 1 are used.\n\nThe code table initially contains codes that are one bit longer than the symbol size in order to accommodate the two special codes ''clr'' and ''end'' and codes for strings that are added during the process. When the table is full the code length increases to give space for more strings, up to a maximum code 4095 = FFF(hex). As the decoder builds its table it tracks these increases in code length and it is able to unpack incoming bytes accordingly.\n\n===Uncompressed GIF===\n[[File:Quilt design as 46x46 uncompressed GIF.gif|thumb|\nA 46 x 46 uncompressed GIF with 7-bit symbols (128 colors, 8-bit codes). Click on the image for an explanation of the code.]]\nThe GIF encoding process can be modified to create a file without LZW compression that is still viewable as a GIF image. This technique was introduced originally as a way to avoid patent infringement. Uncompressed GIF can also be a useful intermediate format for a graphics programmer because individual pixels are accessible for reading or painting. An uncompressed GIF file can be converted to an ordinary GIF file simply by passing it through an image editor.\n\nThe modified encoding method ignores building the LZW table and emits only the root palette codes and the codes for CLEAR and STOP. This yields a simpler encoding (a 1-to-1 correspondence between code values and palette codes) but sacrifices all of the compression: each pixel in the image generates an output code indicating its color index. When processing an uncompressed GIF, a standard GIF decoder will not be prevented from writing strings to its dictionary table, but the code width must never increase since that triggers a different packing of bits to bytes.\n\nIf the symbol width is n, the codes of width n+1 fall naturally into two blocks: the lower block of 2<sup>n</sup> codes for coding single symbols, and the upper block of 2<sup>n</sup> codes that will be used by the decoder for sequences of length greater than one. Of that upper block, the first two codes are already taken: 2<sup>n</sup> for CLEAR and 2<sup>n</sup> + 1 for STOP. The decoder must also be prevented from using the last code in the upper block, 2<sup>n+1</sup> \u2212 1, because when the decoder fills that slot, it will increase the code width. Thus in the upper block there are 2<sup>n</sup> \u2212 3 codes available to the decoder that won't trigger an increase in code width. Because the decoder is always one step behind in maintaining the table, it does not generate a table entry upon receiving the first code from the encoder, but will generate one for each succeeding code. Thus the encoder can generate 2<sup>n</sup> \u2212 2 codes without triggering an increase in code width. Therefore the encoder must emit extra CLEAR codes at intervals of 2<sup>n</sup> \u2212 2 codes or less to make the decoder reset the coding dictionary. The GIF standard allows such extra CLEAR codes to be inserted in the image data at any time. The composite data stream is partitioned into sub-blocks that each carry from 1 to 255 bytes.\n\nFor the sample 3x5 image above, the following 9-bit codes represent \"clear\" (100) followed by image pixels in scan order and \"stop\" (101).\n<pre>\n9-bit codes: 100 028 0FF 0FF 0FF 028 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 0FF 101\n</pre>\nAfter the above codes are mapped to bytes, the uncompressed file differs from the compressed file thus:\n<pre>\n :\n320: 14            20            20 bytes uncompressed image data follow\n321: 00 51 FC FB F7 0F C5 BF 7F FF FE FD FB F7 EF DF BF 7F 01 01\n335: 00                          - end\n :\n</pre>\n\n==Compression example==\nThe trivial example of a large image of solid color demonstrates the variable-length LZW compression used in GIF files.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Code\n! colspan=2 | Pixels\n!

A block of image data begins with a byte that declares the number of bytes to follow. The last block of data for an image is marked by a zero block-length byte.\n\n== Interlacing ==\nThe GIF Specification allows each image within the logical screen of a GIF file to specify that it is interlaced; i.e., that the order of the raster lines in its data block is not sequential. This allows a partial display of the image that can be recognized before the full image is painted.\n\nAn interlaced image is divided from top to bottom into strips 8 pixels high, and the rows of the image are presented in the following order:\n\n* Pass 1: Line 0 (the top-most line) from each strip.\n* Pass 2: Line 4 from each strip.\n* Pass 3: Lines 2 and 6 from each strip.\n* Pass 4: Lines 1, 3, 5, and 7 from each strip.\n\nThe pixels within each line are not interlaced, but presented consecutively from left to right. As with non-interlaced images, there is no break between the data for one line and the data for the next. The indicator that an image is interlaced is a bit set in the image's header block.\n\n==Animated GIF==\n{{expand section|discussion of the accessibility problems, why most browsers enable animated gifs, and how users can block animated gifs|date=May 2015}}\n\n<!--OTRS [[Ticket:2014021510009504]] gives permission for references to some GIF's, and code here.

An animated GIF file comprises a number of frames that are displayed in succession, each introduced by its own GCE, which gives the time delay to wait after the frame is drawn. Global information at the start of the file applies by default to all frames. The data is stream-oriented, so the file-offset of the start of each GCE depends on the length of preceding data. Within each frame the LZW-coded image data is arranged in sub-blocks of up to 255 bytes; the size of each sub-block is declared by the byte that precedes it.\n\nBy default, however, an animation displays the sequence of frames only once, stopping when the last frame is displayed. Since GIF is designed to allow users to define new blocks, [[Netscape]] in the 1990s used the Application Extension block (intended to allow vendors to add application-specific information to the GIF file) to implement the Netscape Application Block (NAB).<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www6.uniovi.es/gifanim/gifabout.htm\n |title=All About GIF89a\n |author=Royal Frazier\n |accessdate=7 January 2013\n}}</ref> This block, placed immediately before all the animation frames, specifies the number of times the sequence of frames should be played.
