Various [[#Definitions|definitions]] exist but fall into two broad categories.\n* The '''small calorie''' or '''gram calorie''' (symbol: '''cal''') is the approximate amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one [[gram]] of water by one degree [[Celsius]] at a pressure of one [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]].<ref name=Webster/>\n* The '''large calorie''' or '''kilogram calorie''' (symbol: '''Cal'''), also known as the '''food calorie''' and similar names,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/remarkablecalorie.html|title=Remarkable Calorie|last=Conn |first=Carole |author2=Len Kravitz |publisher=University of New Mexico|accessdate=30 April 2014}}</ref> is defined in terms of the kilogram rather than the gram.  It is equal to {{val|1000}} small calories, 1 '''kilocalorie''' (symbol: '''kcal''').<ref name=Webster/>\n\nAlthough these units relate to the [[metric system]] all forms of the calorie were deemed obsolete in science after the SI system was adopted in the 1950's.<ref>http://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2891-6-44</ref>  The unit of energy in the [[International System of Units]] is the [[joule]].  One small calorie is approximately<!--4.2 not 4.186 see below --> 4.2 joules (so one large calorie is about 4.2 [[Joule#Kilojoule|kilojoules]]). The factor used to [[Conversion of units of energy|convert]] calories to joules at a given temperature is numerically equivalent to the [[specific heat capacity]] of water expressed in joules per kelvin per gram or per kilogram. The precise conversion factor depends on the definition adopted.\n\nIn spite of its non-official status, the large calorie is still widely used as a unit of [[food energy]]. The small calorie is also often used for measurements in [[chemistry]], although the amounts involved are typically recorded in kilocalories.\n\nThe calorie was first defined by [[Nicolas Cl\u00e9ment]] in 1824 as a unit of [[heat]] energy,<ref name=Hist/> and entered French and English dictionaries between 1841 and 1867. The word comes from Latin ''calor'' meaning \"heat\".\n\n==Definitions==\nThe energy needed to increase the temperature of a given mass of water by 1&nbsp;\u00b0C depends on the atmospheric pressure and the starting temperature. Accordingly, several different precise definitions of the calorie have been used.\n\nThe pressure is usually taken to be the [[standard atmospheric pressure]] ({{val|101.325|u=kPa}}). The temperature increase can be expressed as one [[kelvin]], which means the same as an increment of one degree Celsius.\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n! Name !! Symbol !! Conversions !!

As if to avoid confusion, it is sometimes written ''Calorie'' (with a capital \"C\") in an attempt to make the distinction, although this is not widely understood. Capitalization contravenes the rule that the initial letter of a [[unit name (SI)|unit name]] or [[derived unit|its derivative]] shall be lower case in English.<ref>{{cite web |title=SI Conventions |url=http://www.npl.co.uk/reference/measurement-units/si-conventions/ |accessdate=8 February 2016 |publisher=[[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]]}}</ref>\n\nTo facilitate comparison, [[specific energy]] or energy density figures are often quoted as \"calories per serving\" or \"kilocalories per 100&nbsp;g\". A nutritional requirement or consumption is often expressed in calories per day. One [[gram]] of [[fat]] in food contains nine kilocalories, while a gram of either a [[carbohydrate]] or a [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]] contains approximately four kilocalories.<ref>http://www.fitnessforweightloss.com/calories-how-to-read-a-food-label/</ref> [[Alcohol]] in a food contains seven kilocalories per gram.<ref>http://www.nutristrategy.com/nutrition/calories.htm</ref>\n\n==Chemistry==\nIn other scientific contexts, the term ''calorie'' almost always refers to the small calorie. Even though it is not an SI unit, it is still used in chemistry. For example, the energy released in a [[chemical reaction]] per [[mole (unit)|mole]] of reagent is occasionally expressed in [[kilocalorie per mole|kilocalories per mole]].<ref name=Zvi/> Typically, this use was largely due to the ease with which it could be calculated in laboratory reactions, especially in aqueous solution: a volume of reagent dissolved in water forming a solution, with concentration expressed in moles per liter (1 liter weighing 1&nbsp;kg), will induce a temperature change in degrees Celsius in the total volume of water solvent, and these quantities (volume, molar concentration and temperature change) can then be used to calculate energy per mole. It is also occasionally used to specify energy quantities that relate to reaction energy, such as [[bond energy|enthalpy of formation]] and the size of [[activation energy|activation barrier]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} However, its use is being superseded by the SI unit, the joule, and multiples thereof such as the kilojoule.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|2}}\n* [[Basal metabolic rate]]\n* [[Caloric theory]]\n* [[Conversion of units of energy]]\n* [[Empty calorie]]\n* [[Food energy]]\n* [[wikt:frigorie|Frigorie]]\n* [[Nutrition facts label]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n<references>\n\n<ref name=Rossini>\n  {{cite journal|last=Rossini|first=Fredrick| title=Excursion in Chemical Thermodynamics, from the Past into the Future|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|year=1964|volume=8|issue=2|page=107|doi=10.1351/pac196408020095 |url=http://iupac.org/publications/pac/8/2/0095/|accessdate=21 January 2013|authorlink=Frederick Rossini|quote=both the IT calorie and the thermochemical calorie are completely independent of the heat capacity of water.}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Webster>\n  Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary Def 1a http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/calorie\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=iupac>\n  {{cite book|title=Compendium of Analytical Nomenclature|year=1997|author=International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)|author-link=International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry| isbn=0-86542-615-5| url=http://iupac.org/publications/analytical_compendium/Cha01sec6.pdf|edition=3|accessdate=31 August 2013|chapter=1.6 Conversion tables for units}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Zvi>\n  Zvi Rappoport ed.
