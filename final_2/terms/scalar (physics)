A scalar is usually said to be a physical quantity that only has magnitude and no other characteristics. This is in contrast to [[Euclidean vector|vectors]], [[tensor]]s, etc. which are described by several numbers that characterize their magnitude, direction, and so on. A vector is usually said to be a physical quantity that has magnitude and direction.  Formally, a scalar is unchanged by [[coordinate system]] rotations or reflections (in [[Newtonian mechanics]]), or by [[Lorentz transformation]]s or space-time translations (in relativity).  A related concept is a [[pseudoscalar (physics)|pseudoscalar]], which is invariant under [[proper rotation]]s but (like a [[pseudovector]]) flips sign under [[improper rotation]]s. The concept of a scalar in physics is essentially the same [[Scalar (mathematics)|as in mathematics]]. A physical scalar field is one type of more general fields, like [[vector field|vector fields]], [[spinor field|spinor fields]], and [[tensor field|tensor fields]]. \n\nAn example of a scalar quantity is [[temperature]]: the temperature at a given point is a single number. Velocity, on the other hand, is a vector quantity: velocity in three-dimensional space is specified by three values; in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] the values are the speeds relative to each [[coordinate axis]]. The associated fields describe the temperature and velocity in each point of some space. Considering the norms of the velocity vectors results in a scalar field of the speeds in each point of the space.\n\n==Physical quantity==\n{{Main|Physical quantity}}\nA physical [[quantity]] is expressed as the [[product (mathematics)|product]]  of a [[number|numerical value]] and a [[physical unit]], not merely a number. The quantity does not depend on the unit (e.g. for distance, 1&nbsp;km is the same as 1000 m), although the number depends on the unit. Thus, following the example of distance, the quantity does not depend on the length of the base vectors of the coordinate system. Also, other changes of the coordinate system may affect the formula for computing the scalar (for example, the Euclidean formula for distance in terms of coordinates relies on the basis being [[orthonormal]]), but not the scalar itself. In this sense, physical distance deviates from the definition of [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] in not being just a real number; however it satisfies all other properties. The same applies for other physical quantities which are not dimensionless. Direction does not apply to scalars; they are specified by magnitude or quantity alone.\n\n==Examples in classical physics==\nSome examples of scalars include the [[mass]], [[charge (physics)|charge]], [[volume]], [[Time in physics|time]], [[speed]], [[temperature]],<ref>{{harvnb|Feynman|Leighton|Sands|1963}}</ref> or [[electric potential]] at a point inside a medium. The [[distance]] between two points in three-dimensional space is a scalar, but the [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]] from one of those points to the other is not, since describing a direction requires two physical quantities such as the angle on the horizontal plane and the angle away from that plane. [[Force]] cannot be described using a scalar, since force is composed of direction and [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], however, the magnitude of a force alone can be described with a scalar, for instance the [[gravitation]]al [[force]] acting on a particle is not a scalar, but its magnitude is. The [[speed]] of an object is a scalar (e.g. 180&nbsp;km/h), while its [[velocity]] is not (i.e. 180&nbsp;km/h ''north''). \nOther examples of scalar quantities in Newtonian mechanics include [[electric charge]] and [[charge density]].\n\nAn example of a pseudoscalar is the scalar [[triple product]] (see [[vector (geometric)|vector]]), and thus the signed volume.<ref>{{Harvnb|Arfken|1985}}</ref> Another example is [[magnetic charge]] (as it is mathematically defined, regardless of whether it actually exists physically).\n\n==Scalars in relativity theory==\n{{Main|Lorentz scalar}}\n{{See also|Standard Model#Higgs sector}}\nIn the [[theory of relativity]], one considers changes of coordinate systems that trade space for time.  As a consequence, several physical quantities that are scalars in [[Classical physics|\"classical\" (non-relativistic) physics]] need to be combined with other quantities and treated as [[four-vector]]s or tensors.  For example, the [[charge density]] at a point in a medium, which is a scalar in classical physics, must be combined with the local [[current density]] (a 3-vector) to comprise a relativistic 4-vector.  Similarly, [[energy density]] must be combined with momentum density and [[pressure]] into the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]].\n\nExamples of scalar quantities in relativity include [[electric charge]], [[Spacetime#Spacetime intervals|spacetime interval]] (e.g., [[proper time]] and [[proper length]]), and [[invariant mass]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Scalar field]]\n*[[Scalar field theory]]\n*[[Relative scalar]]\n*[[Pseudoscalar]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book\n|last = Arfken\n|first = George\n|authorlink = George B.
