Video can be carried on a variety of media, including [[radio broadcast]], [[tapes]], [[DVDs]], [[Video file format|computer files]] etc.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of television}}\nVideo [[technology]] was first developed for [[mechanical television]] systems, which were quickly replaced by [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) [[television]] systems, but several new technologies for video [[display device]]s have since been invented. Video was originally exclusively a [[Live television|live]] technology. [[Charles Ginsburg]] led an [[Ampex]] research team developing one of the first practical [[video tape recorder]] (VTR). In 1951 the first video tape recorder captured live images from [[television camera]]s by converting the camera's electrical impulses and saving the information onto magnetic [[video tape]].\n\nVideo recorders were sold for $50,000 in 1956, and videotapes cost $300 per one-hour reel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/technology/technology10.html |title=TV Technology 10. Roll VTR |first=Richard |last=Elen}}</ref> However, prices gradually dropped over the years; in 1971, Sony began selling [[videocassette recorder]] (VCR) decks and tapes into the [[consumer market]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rewindmuseum.com/umatic.htm |title=Vintage Umatic VCR |accessdate=21 February 2014 |section=Sony VO-1600. The worlds first VCR. 1971 |website=Rewind Museum}}</ref>\n\nThe use of [[Digital data|digital]] techniques in video created [[digital video]], which allowed higher quality and, eventually, much lower cost than earlier analog technology. After the invention of the [[DVD]] in 1997 and [[Blu-ray Disc]] in 2006, sales of videotape and recording equipment plummeted. Advances in computer technology allowed even inexpensive [[personal computer]]s to capture, store, edit and transmit digital video, further reducing the cost of video production, allowing program-makers and broadcasters to move to [[tapeless production]]. The advent of [[digital broadcasting]] and the subsequent [[digital television transition]] is in the process of relegating analog video to the status of a [[legacy technology]] in most parts of the world. {{As of|2015}}, with the increasing use of high-resolution video cameras with improved [[dynamic range]] and [[color gamut]]s, and high-dynamic-range [[digital intermediate]] data formats with improved [[color depth]], modern digital video technology is slowly converging with [[digital film]] technology.\n\n== Characteristics of video streams ==\n\n===Number of frames per second===\n''[[Frame rate]]'', the number of still pictures per unit of time of video, ranges from six or eight frames per second (''frame/s'') for old mechanical cameras to 120 or more frames per second for new professional cameras. [[PAL]] standards  (Europe, Asia, Australia, etc.) and [[SECAM]] (France, Russia, parts of Africa etc.) specify 25 frame/s, while [[NTSC]] standards (USA, Canada, Japan, etc.) specify 29.97 frames.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Film is shot at the slower frame rate of 24 frames per second, which slightly complicates the process of transferring a cinematic motion picture to video. The minimum frame rate to achieve a comfortable illusion of a [[Persistence of vision|moving image]] is about sixteen frames per second.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://vision.arc.nasa.gov/publications/TemporalSensitivity.pdf | title=Temporal Sensitivity | author=Andrew B. Watson | year=1986 | journal=Sensory Processes and Perception}}</ref>\n\n===Interlaced vs progressive===\nVideo can be [[interlaced]] or [[Progressive scan|progressive]]. Interlacing was invented as a way to reduce flicker in early [[mechanical television|mechanical]] and [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] video displays without increasing the number of complete [[frames per second]], which would have sacrificed image detail to remain within the limitations of a narrow [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]. The horizontal [[scan line]]s of each complete frame are treated as if numbered consecutively, and captured as two ''fields'': an ''odd field'' (upper field) consisting of the odd-numbered lines and an ''even field'' (lower field) consisting of the even-numbered lines.\n\nAnalog display devices reproduce each frame in the same way, effectively doubling the frame rate as far as perceptible overall flicker is concerned. When the image capture device acquires the fields one at a time, rather than dividing up a complete frame after it is captured, the frame rate for motion is effectively doubled as well, resulting in smoother, more lifelike reproduction (although with halved detail) of rapidly moving parts of the image when viewed on an interlaced CRT display, but the display of such a signal on a progressive scan device is problematic.\n\nNTSC, PAL and SECAM are interlaced formats.  Abbreviated video resolution specifications often include an ''i'' to indicate interlacing.  For example, PAL video format is often specified as ''576i50'', where ''576'' indicates the total number of horizontal scan lines, ''i'' indicates interlacing, and ''50'' indicates 50 fields (half-frames) per second.\n\nIn ''progressive scan'' systems, each refresh period updates all scan lines in each frame in sequence. When displaying a natively progressive broadcast or recorded signal, the result is optimum spatial resolution of both the stationary and moving parts of the image. When displaying a natively interlaced signal, however, overall spatial resolution is degraded by simple [[line doubling]]\u2014artifacts such as flickering or \"comb\" effects in moving parts of the image appear unless special signal processing eliminates them. A procedure known as [[deinterlacing]] can optimize the display of an interlaced video signal from an analog, DVD or satellite source on a progressive scan device such as an [[LCD Television]], digital video projector or plasma panel. Deinterlacing cannot, however, produce [[video quality]] that is equivalent to true progressive scan source material.\n\n===Aspect ratio===\n[[Image:Aspect ratios.svg|thumbnail|250px|Comparison of common [[cinematography]] and traditional [[television]] (green) aspect ratios]]\n[[Aspect ratio (image)|Aspect ratio]] describes the dimensions of video screens and video picture elements.  All popular video formats are rectilinear, and so can be described by a ratio between width and height.  The screen aspect ratio of a traditional television screen is 4:3, or about 1.33:1. High definition televisions use an aspect ratio of 16:9, or about 1.78:1. The aspect ratio of a full 35&nbsp;mm film frame with soundtrack (also known as the [[Academy ratio]]) is 1.375:1.\n\n[[Pixel]]s on computer monitors are usually square, but pixels used in [[digital video]] often have non-square aspect ratios, such as those used in the PAL and NTSC variants of the [[CCIR 601]] digital video standard, and the corresponding anamorphic widescreen formats. Therefore, a 720 by 480 pixel NTSC DV image displayes with the 4:3 aspect ratio (the traditional television standard) if the pixels are thin, and displays at the 16:9 aspect ratio (the anamorphic widescreen format) if the pixels are fat.\n\nThe popularity of viewing video on mobile phones has led to the growth of [[vertical video]]. Mary Meeker, a partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers]], highlighted the growth of vertical video viewing in her 2015 Internet Trends Report{{snd}} growing from 5% of video viewing in 2010 to 29% in 2015. Vertical video ads like Snapchat\u2019s are watched in their entirety 9X more than landscape video ads.<ref name=Constine>{{cite news|author=Constine, Josh|date=May 27, 2015|title=The Most Important Insights From Mary Meeker\u2019s 2015 Internet Trends Report|url=http://techcrunch.com/gallery/best-of-meeker/|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}</ref> The format was rapidly taken up by leading social platforms and media publishers such as [[Mashable]]<ref name=Baysinger>{{cite news|author=Baysinger, Tim|date=August 3, 2015|title=Mashable Uses Vertical Video to Visit the Creator of the Cronut|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/press/mashable-uses-vertical-video-visit-creator-cronut-166199=Digiday|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}</ref> In October 2015 video platform [[Grabyo]] launched technology to help video publishers adapt horizotonal 16:9 video into mobile formats such as vertical and square.<ref name=Fratti>{{cite news|author=Fratti, Karen|date=October 20, 2015|title=Grabyo Adds Square, Vertical Video Capabilities|url=http://www.adweek.com/lostremote/grabyo-adds-square-vertical-video-capabilities/54238=Ad Week|accessdate=October 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Color space and bits per pixel===\n[[Image:YUV UV plane.svg|thumb|200px|Example of U-V color plane, Y value=0.5]]\n\n''Color model name'' describes the video color representation. ''[[YIQ]]'' was used in NTSC television. It corresponds closely to the ''[[YUV]]'' scheme used in NTSC and PAL television and the ''[[YDbDr]]'' scheme used by SECAM television.\n\nThe number of distinct colors a pixel can represent depends on the number of ''bits per pixel'' (bpp). A common way to reduce the amount of data required in digital video is by [[chroma subsampling]] (e.g., [[4:2:2#4:4:4|4:4:4]], [[4:2:2#4:2:2|4:2:2]], [[4:2:0#4:2:0|4:2:0]]/[[4:1:1#4:1:1|4:1:1]]).  Because the human eye is less sensitive to details in color than brightness, the luminance data for all pixels is maintained, while the chrominance data is averaged for a number of pixels in a block and that same value is used for all of them. For example, this results in a 50% reduction in chrominance data using 2 pixel blocks (4:2:2) or 75% using 4 pixel blocks(4:2:0).  This process does not reduce the number of possible color values that can be displayed, it reduces the number of distinct points at which the color changes.\n\n===Video quality===\n[[Video quality]] can be measured with formal metrics like [[Peak signal-to-noise ratio|PSNR]] or with [[subjective video quality]] using expert observation.\n\nThe subjective video quality of a video processing system is evaluated as follows:\n\n* Choose the video sequences (the ''SRC'') to use for testing.\n* Choose the settings of the system to evaluate (the ''HRC'').\n* Choose a test [[Scientific method|method]] for how to present video sequences to experts and to collect their ratings.\n* Invite a sufficient number of experts, preferably not fewer than 15.\n* Carry out testing.\n* Calculate the average marks for each ''HRC'' based on the experts' ratings.\n\nMany [[subjective video quality]] methods are described in the [[ITU-T]] recommendation BT.500. One of the standardized method is the ''Double Stimulus Impairment Scale'' (DSIS).  In DSIS, each expert views an ''unimpaired'' reference video followed by an ''impaired'' version of the same video.  The expert then rates the ''impaired'' video using a scale ranging from \"impairments are imperceptible\" to \"impairments are very annoying\".\n\n===Video compression method (digital only)===\n{{Main|Video compression}}\n\n[[Uncompressed video]] delivers maximum quality, but with a very high [[Uncompressed video#Storage and Data Rates for Uncompressed Video|data rate]].\nA variety of methods are used to [[video compression|compress]] video streams, with the most effective ones using a [[Inter frame#Typical Group Of Pictures .28GOP.29 structure|Group Of Pictures]] (GOP) to reduce spatial and temporal [[Redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]]. Broadly speaking, spatial redundancy is reduced by registering differences between parts of a single frame; this task is known as ''[[Intra-frame|intraframe]] compression'' and is closely related to [[image compression]]. Likewise, temporal redundancy can be reduced by registering differences between frames; this task is known as ''[[Inter frame|interframe]] compression'', including [[motion compensation]] and other techniques. The most common modern standards are [[MPEG-2]], used for [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and [[satellite television]], and [[MPEG-4]], used for [[AVCHD]], Mobile phones (3GP) and Internet.\n\n===Stereoscopic===\n''Stereoscopic video'' can be created using several different methods:\n\n* Two channels: a right channel for the right eye and a left channel for the left eye. Both channels may be viewed simultaneously by using [[light polarization|light-polarizing filters]] 90 degrees off-axis from each other on two video projectors. These separately polarized channels are viewed wearing eyeglasses with matching polarization filters.\n* One channel with two overlaid color-coded layers. This left and right layer technique is occasionally used for network broadcast, or recent \"anaglyph\" releases of 3D movies on DVD. Simple Red/Cyan plastic glasses provide the means to view the images discretely to form a stereoscopic view of the content.\n* One channel with alternating left and right frames for the corresponding eye, using [[LCD shutter glasses]] that read the frame sync from the [[VGA]] [[Display Data Channel]] to alternately block the image to each eye, so the appropriate eye sees the correct frame. This method is most common in computer [[virtual reality]] applications such as in a [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment]], but reduces effective video framerate to one-half of normal (for example, from 120&nbsp;Hz to 60&nbsp;Hz).\n\n[[Blu-ray Disc]]s greatly improve the sharpness and detail of the two-color 3D effect in color-coded stereo programs. See articles [[Stereoscopy]] and [[3-D film]].\n\n==Formats{{anchor|Video formats}}==\nDifferent layers of video transmission and storage each provide their own set of formats to choose from.\n\nFor transmission, there is a physical connector and signal protocol (\"video connection standard\" below).  A given physical link can carry certain \"display standards\" that specify a particular refresh rate, [[display resolution]], and [[color space]].\n\nMany analog and digital [[recording format]]s are in use, and digital [[video clips]] can also be stored on a [[computer file system]] as [[computer file|file]]s, which have their own formats.  In addition to the physical format used by the [[data storage device]] or transmission medium, the stream of ones and zeros that is sent must be in a particular digital ''[[video compression format]]'', of which a number are available.\n\n===Analog video===\nAnalog video is a video signal transferred by an [[analog signal]]. An analog color video signal contains [[Luma (video)|luminance]], brightness (Y) and [[chrominance]] (C) of an [[analog television]] image.  When combined into one channel, it is called [[composite video]] as is the case, among others with [[NTSC]], [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]].\n\nAnalog video may be carried in separate channels, as in two channel [[S-Video]] (YC) and multi-channel [[component video]] formats.\n\nAnalog video is used in both consumer and professional [[television production]] applications.\n<gallery>\nComposite-video-cable.jpg|[[Composite video]]<br>(single channel RCA)\nClose-up_of_S-video_female_connector.jpg|[[S-Video]]<br>(2-channel YC)\nComponent-cables.jpg|[[Component video]]<br>(3-channel RGB)\nSCART_20050724_002.jpg|[[SCART]]\nVga-cable.jpg|[[VGA]]\n3.5mm.jpg|[[Phone connector (audio)|TRRC]]\nD4_video_connector.jpg|[[D-Terminal]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Digital video===\n[[Digital video]] signal formats with higher quality have been adopted, including [[serial digital interface]] (SDI), [[Digital Visual Interface]] (DVI), [[HDMI|High-Definition Multimedia Interface]] (HDMI) and [[DisplayPort]] Interface, though analog video interfaces are still used and widely available. There exist different adaptors and variants.\n\n<gallery>\nBNC_connector_%28male%29.jpg|[[Serial digital interface]] (SDI)\nDvi-cable.jpg|[[Digital Visual Interface]] (DVI)\nHDMI-Connector.jpg|[[HDMI]]\nDisplayport-cable.jpg|[[DisplayPort]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Transport medium==\nVideo can be transmitted or transported in a variety of ways. Wireless broadcast as an analog or digital signal. Coaxial cable in a closed circuit system can be sent as analog interlaced 1 volt peak to peak with a maximum horizontal line resolution up to 480. Broadcast or studio cameras use a single or dual coaxial cable system using a progressive scan format known as SDI serial digital interface and HD-SDI for High Definition video. The distances of transmission are somewhat limited depending on the manufacturer the format may be proprietary. SDI has a negligible lag and is uncompressed. There are initiatives to use the SDI standards in closed circuit surveillance systems, for Higher Definition images, over longer distances on coax or twisted pair cable. Due to the nature of the higher bandwidth needed, the distance the signal can be effectively sent is a half to a third of what the older interlaced analog systems supported.<ref>{{cite web |title=Serial digital interface Design, SDI Video |url=http://www.interfacebus.com/Serial_Digital_Interface_SDI_Video.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212193756/http://www.interfacebus.com/Serial_Digital_Interface_SDI_Video.html |archivedate=20 December 2013 |accessdate=21 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Video connectors, cables, and signal standards===\n* See [[List of video connectors]] for information about physical connectors and related signal standards.\n\n===Video display standards===\n{{further|Display technology}}\n\n====Digital television====\n{{Further|Broadcast television systems}}\n\nNew formats for [[digital television]] broadcasts use the [[MPEG-2]] [[video codec]] and include:\n\n* [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]] \u2013 United States, [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], [[Korea]]\n* [[Digital Video Broadcasting]] (DVB) \u2013 [[Europe]]\n* [[ISDB]] \u2013 [[Japan]]\n** [[ISDB-Tb]] \u2013 uses the MPEG-4 video codec \u2013 [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]]\n* [[Digital Multimedia Broadcasting]] (DMB) \u2013 [[Korea]]\n\n====Analog television====\n{{Further|Broadcast television systems}}\n\n[[Analog television]] broadcast standards include:\n\n* [[Field-sequential color system|FCS]] \u2013 USA, Russia; obsolete\n* [[Multiplexed Analogue Components|MAC]] \u2013 Europe; obsolete\n* [[Multiple sub-nyquist sampling Encoding system|MUSE]] \u2013 Japan\n* [[NTSC]] \u2013 [[United States|USA]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]]\n* [[PAL]]  \u2013 [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Oceania]]\n** [[PAL-M]] \u2013 PAL variation.
