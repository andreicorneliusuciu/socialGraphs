Like a [[Set (mathematics)|set]], it contains [[Element (mathematics)|members]] (also called ''elements'', or ''terms'').  The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the ''length'' of the sequence.  Unlike a set, order matters, and exactly the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in the sequence.  Formally, a sequence can be defined as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose domain is either the set of the [[natural number]]s (for infinite sequences) or the set of the first ''n'' [[natural number]]s (for a sequence of finite length ''n'').  The position of an element in a sequence is its ''rank'' or ''index''; it is the integer from which the element is the image; it depends on the context or of a specific convention, if the first element has index 0 or 1.  When a symbol has been chosen for denoting a sequence, the ''n''th element of the sequence is denoted by this symbol with ''n'' as subscript; for example, the ''n''th element of the [[Fibonacci sequence]] is generally denoted ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\nFor example, (M, A, R, Y) is a sequence of letters with the letter 'M' first and 'Y' last.  This sequence differs from (A, R, M, Y).  Also, the sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), which contains the number 1 at two different positions, is a valid sequence.  Sequences can be ''[[finite set|finite]]'', as in these examples, or ''[[Infinite set|infinite]]'', such as the sequence of all [[even and odd numbers|even]] [[positive integer]]s (2, 4, 6, ...).  In [[computing]] and [[computer science]], finite sequences are sometimes called [[string (computer science)|strings]], [[word (mathematics)|words]] or [[list (computer science)|lists]], the different names commonly corresponding to different ways to represent them in [[computer memory]]; infinite sequences are also called [[stream (computing)|streams]].  The empty sequence&nbsp;(&nbsp;) is included in most notions of sequence, but may be excluded depending on the context.\n[[Image:Cauchy sequence illustration2.svg|right|thumb|350px|An infinite sequence of [[real number]]s (in blue).  This sequence is neither increasing, nor decreasing, nor convergent, nor [[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy]].  It is, however, bounded.]]\n\n== Examples and notation ==\nA sequence can be thought of as a list of elements with a particular order.  Sequences are useful in a number of mathematical disciplines for studying [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], [[Space (mathematics)|spaces]], and other mathematical structures using the [[#Limits and convergence|convergence]] properties of sequences.  In particular, sequences are the basis for [[series (mathematics)|series]], which are important in [[differential equations]] and [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]].  Sequences are also of interest in their own right and can be studied as patterns or puzzles, such as in the study of [[prime number]]s.\n\nThere are a number of ways to denote a sequence, some of which are more useful for specific types of sequences.  One way to specify a sequence is to list the elements.  For example, the first four odd numbers form the sequence (1, 3, 5, 7).  This notation can be used for infinite sequences as well.  For instance, the infinite sequence of positive odd integers can be written (1, 3, 5, 7, ...).  Listing is most useful for infinite sequences with a [[pattern]] that can be easily discerned from the first few elements.  Other ways to denote a sequence are discussed after the examples.\n\n===Examples===\n[[File:Fibonacci blocks.svg|thumb|right|A tiling with squares whose sides are successive Fibonacci numbers in length.]]\n\nThe [[prime number]]s are the [[natural numbers]] bigger than 1, that have no [[divisor]]s but 1 and themselves.  Taking these in their natural order gives the sequence (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...).  The prime numbers are widely used in [[mathematics]] and specifically in [[number theory]].\n\nThe [[Fibonacci numbers]] are the integer sequence whose elements are the sum of the previous two elements.  The first two elements are either 0 and 1 or 1 and 1 so that the sequence is (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...).\n\nFor a large list of examples of integers sequences see [http://oeis.org/wiki/Welcome#Some_Famous_Sequences On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences].\n\nOther examples of sequences include ones made up of [[rational numbers]], [[real number]]s, and [[complex numbers]].  The sequence (.9, .99, .999, .9999, ...) approaches the number 1.  In fact, every real number can be written as the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of a sequence of rational numbers, e.g. via its [[decimal expansion]].  For instance, [[pi|\u03c0]] is the limit of the sequence (3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415, ...).  A related sequence is the sequence of decimal digits of \u03c0, i.e. (3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, ...).  This sequence does not have any pattern that is easily discernible by eye, unlike the preceding sequence, which is increasing.\n\n===Indexing===\nOther notations can be useful for sequences whose pattern cannot be easily guessed, or for sequences that do not have a pattern such as the digits of [[pi|\u03c0]].  One such notation is to write down a general formula for computing the ''n''th term as a function of ''n'', enclose it in parentheses, and include a subscript indicating the range of values that ''n'' can take.  For example, in this notation the sequence of even numbers could be written as <math>(2n)_{n\\in\\mathbb N}</math>.  The sequence of squares could be written as <math>(n^2)_{n\\in\\mathbb N}</math>.  The variable ''n'' is called an [[Indexed family|index]], and the set of values that it can take is called the [[index set]].\n\nIt is often useful to combine this notation with the technique of treating the elements of a sequence as variables.  This yields expressions like <math>(a_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb N}</math>, which denotes a sequence whose ''n''th element is given by the variable <math>a_n</math>.  For example:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\na_1 &= 1\\text{st element of }(a_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb N} \\\\\na_2 &= 2\\text{nd element } \\\\\na_3 &= 3\\text{rd element } \\\\\n&\\vdots \\\\\na_{n-1} &= (n-1)\\text{th element} \\\\\na_n &= n\\text{th element} \\\\\na_{n+1} &= (n+1)\\text{th element} \\\\\n& \\vdots\n \\end{align}</math>\nNote that we can consider multiple sequences at the same time by using different variables; e.g. <math>(b_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb N}</math> could be a different sequence than <math>(a_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb N}</math>.  We can even consider a sequence of sequences: <math>((a_{m, n})_{n\\in\\mathbb N})_{m\\in\\mathbb N}</math> denotes a sequence whose ''m''th term is the sequence <math>(a_{m, n})_{n\\in\\mathbb N}</math>.\n\nAn alternative to writing the domain of a sequence in the subscript is to indicate the range of values that the index can take by listing its highest and lowest legal values.  For example, the notation <math>(k^2)_{k = 1}^{10}</math> denotes the ten-term sequence of squares <math>(1, 4, 9, ..., 100)</math>.  The limits <math>\\infty</math> and <math>-\\infty</math> are allowed, but they do not represent valid values for the index, only the [[supremum]] or [[infimum]] of such values, respectively.  For example, the sequence <math>(a_n)_{n = 1}^\\infty</math> is the same as the sequence <math>(a_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb N}</math>, and does not contain an additional term \"at infinity\".  The sequence <math>(a_n)_{n = -\\infty}^\\infty</math> is a '''bi-infinite sequence''', and can also be written as <math>(..., a_{-1}, a_0, a_1, a_2, ...)</math>.\n\nIn cases where the set of indexing numbers is understood, the subscripts and superscripts are often left off.  That is, one simply writes <math>(a_k)</math> for an arbitrary sequence.  Often, the index ''k'' is understood to run from 1 to \u221e.  However, sequences are frequently indexed starting from zero, as in\n:<math>(a_k)_{k=0}^\\infty = ( a_0, a_1, a_2, ... ).</math>\nIn some cases the elements of the sequence are related naturally to a sequence of integers whose pattern can be easily inferred.  In these cases the index set may be implied by a listing of the first few abstract elements.  For instance, the sequence of squares of [[odd number]]s could be denoted in any of the following ways.\n\n* <math>(1, 9, 25, ...)</math>\n* <math>(a_1, a_3, a_5, ...), \\qquad a_k = k^2</math>\n* <math>(a_{2k-1})_{k=1}^\\infty, \\qquad a_k = k^2</math>\n* <math>(a_{k})_{k=1}^\\infty, \\qquad a_k = (2k-1)^2</math>\n* <math>((2k-1)^2)_{k=1}^\\infty</math>\n\nMoreover, the subscripts and superscripts could have been left off in the third, fourth, and fifth notations, if the indexing set was understood to be the [[natural numbers]].  Note that in the second and third bullets, there is a well-defined sequence <math>(a_{k})_{k=1}^\\infty</math>, but it is not the same as the sequence denoted by the expression.\n\n=== Defining a sequence by recursion ===\nSequences whose elements are related to the previous elements in a straightforward way are often defined using '''[[Recursive definition|recursion]]'''.  This is in contrast to the definition of sequence elements as a function of their position.\n\nTo define a sequence by recursion, one needs a rule to construct each element in terms of the ones before it.  In addition, enough initial elements must be provided so that all subsequent elements of the sequence can be computed by the rule.  The principle of [[mathematical induction]] can be used to [[proof (mathematics)|prove]] that in this case, there is exactly one sequence that satisfies both the recursion rule and the initial conditions.  Induction can also be used to prove properties about a sequence, especially for sequences whose most natural description is recursive.\n\nThe [[Fibonacci sequence]] can be defined using a recursive rule along with two initial elements.  The rule is that each element is the sum of the previous two elements, and the first two elements are 0 and 1.\n:<math>a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}</math>, {{pad|4em}} with {{pad|2em}} <math>a_0 = 0</math> and <math>a_1 = 1</math>.\nThe first ten terms of this sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.  A more complicated example of a sequence that is defined recursively is [http://oeis.org/A005132 Recaman's sequence].  We can define Recaman's sequence by\n:<math>a_0 = 0</math> and <math>a_n = a_{n-1} - n</math>, if the result is positive and not already in the list.  Otherwise, <math>a_n = a_{n-1} + n</math>.\n\nNot all sequences can be specified by a rule in the form of an equation, recursive or not, and some can be quite complicated.  For example, the sequence of [[prime number]]s is the set of prime numbers in their natural order, i.e. (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...).\n\nMany sequences have the property that each element of a sequence can be computed from the previous element.  In this case, there is some function ''f'' such that for all ''n'', <math>a_{n+1} = f(a_n)</math>.\n\n== Formal definition and basic properties ==\nThere are many different notions of sequences in mathematics, some of which (''e.g.'', [[exact sequence]]) are not covered by the definitions and notations introduced below.\n\n===Formal definition===\n\nFor the purposes of this article, we define a sequence to be a [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose domain is a [[Convex set#Order topology|convex]] subset of the set of [[integers]].  This definition covers several different uses of the word \"sequence\", including one-sided infinite sequences, bi-infinite sequences, and finite sequences (see below for definitions).  However, many authors use a narrower definition by requiring the domain of a sequence to be the set of [[natural numbers]].  This definition has the disadvantage that it rules out finite sequences and bi-infinite sequences, both of which are usually called sequences in standard mathematical practice.  Many authors also impose a requirement on the [[codomain]] of a function before calling it a sequence, by requiring it to be the set '''R''' of real numbers,<ref name=\"Gaughan\" /> the set '''C''' of complex numbers,<ref name=Saff>{{Cite book |title=Fundamentals of Complex Analysis|chapter=Chapter 2.1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fVsZAQAAIAAJ&q=saff+%26+Snider&dq=saff+%26+Snider&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rT7PUPaiL4OE2gXvg4GoBQ&ved=0CFEQ6AEwAw\n|author=Edward B.

Munkres |isbn=01-318-1629-2}}</ref>\n\nAlthough sequences are a type of function, they are usually distinguished notationally from functions in that the input is written as a subscript rather than in parentheses, i.e. ''a<sub>n</sub>'' rather than ''f''(''n'').  There are terminological differences as well: the value of a sequence at the input 1 is called the \"first element\" of the sequence, the value at 2 is called the \"second element\", etc.  Also, while a function abstracted from its input is usually denoted by a single letter, e.g. ''f'', a sequence abstracted from its input is usually written by a notation such as <math>(a_n)_{n\\in A}</math>, or just as <math>(a_n)</math>.  Here ''A'' is the domain, or index set, of the sequence.\n\nSequences and their limits (see below) are important concepts for studying topological spaces.  An important generalization of sequences is the concept of [[net (mathematics)|nets]].  A '''net''' is a function from a (possibly [[uncountable]]) [[directed set]] to a topological space.  The notational conventions for sequences normally apply to nets as well.\n\n=== Finite and infinite ===\n{{See also|\u03c9-language}}\nThe '''length''' of a sequence is defined as the number of terms in the sequence.\n\nA sequence of a finite length ''n'' is also called an [[n-tuple|''n''-tuple]].  Finite sequences include the '''empty sequence'''&nbsp;(&nbsp;) that has no elements.\n\n{{anchor|Doubly infinite|Doubly-infinite sequences}}\nNormally, the term ''infinite sequence'' refers to a sequence that is infinite in one direction, and finite in the other\u2014the sequence has a first element, but no final element.  Such a sequence is called a '''singly infinite sequence''' or a '''one-sided infinite sequence''' when disambiguation is necessary.  In contrast, a sequence that is infinite in both directions\u2014i.e. that has neither a first nor a final element\u2014is called a '''bi-infinite sequence''', '''two-way infinite sequence''', or '''doubly infinite sequence'''.  A function from the set '''Z''' of ''all'' [[integers]] into a set, such as for instance the sequence of all even integers ( \u2026, \u22124, \u22122, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\u2026 ), is bi-infinite.  This sequence could be denoted <math>(2n)_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}</math>.\n\n===Increasing and decreasing===\nA sequence is said to be ''[[monotonically increasing]]'', if each term is greater than or equal to the one before it.  For example, the sequence <math>(a_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty} </math> is monotonically increasing if and only if ''a''<sub>''n''+1</sub> <math>\\geq</math> ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> for all ''n'' \u2208 '''N'''.  If each consecutive term is strictly greater than (>) the previous term then the sequence is called '''strictly monotonically increasing'''.  A sequence is '''monotonically decreasing''', if each consecutive term is less than or equal to the previous one, and '''strictly monotonically decreasing''', if each is strictly less than the previous.  If a sequence is either increasing or decreasing it is called a '''monotone''' sequence.  This is a special case of the more general notion of a [[monotonic function]].\n\nThe terms '''nondecreasing''' and '''nonincreasing''' are often used in place of ''increasing'' and ''decreasing'' in order to avoid any possible confusion with ''strictly increasing'' and ''strictly decreasing'', respectively.\n\n===Bounded===\nIf the sequence of real numbers (''a<sub>n</sub>'') is such that all the terms are less than some real number ''M'', then the sequence is said to be '''bounded from above'''.  In less words, this means that there exists ''M'' such that for all ''n'', ''a<sub>n</sub>'' \u2264 ''M''.  Any such ''M'' is called an ''upper bound''.  Likewise, if, for some real ''m'', ''a<sub>n</sub>'' \u2265 ''m'' for all ''n'' greater than some ''N'', then the sequence is '''bounded from below''' and any such ''m'' is called a ''lower bound''.  If a sequence is both bounded from above and bounded from below, then the sequence is said to be '''bounded'''.\n\n===Subsequences===\nA '''[[subsequence]]''' of a given sequence is a sequence formed from the given sequence by deleting some of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements.  For instance, the sequence of positive even integers (2, 4, 6, ...) is a subsequence of the positive integers (1, 2, 3, ...).  The positions of some elements change when other elements are deleted.  However, the relative positions are preserved.\n\nFormally, a subsequence of the sequence <math>(a_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb N}</math> is any sequence of the form <math>(a_{n_k})_{k\\in\\mathbb N}</math>, where <math>(n_k)_{k\\in\\mathbb N}</math> is a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers.\n\n===Other types of sequences===\nSome other types of sequences that are easy to define include:\n* An '''[[integer sequence]]''' is a sequence whose terms are integers.\n* A '''[[polynomial sequence]]''' is a sequence whose terms are polynomials.\n* A positive integer sequence is sometimes called '''multiplicative''', if ''a''<sub>''nm''</sub> = ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> ''a''<sub>''m''</sub> for all pairs ''n'', ''m'' such that ''n'' and ''m'' are [[coprime]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Lectures on generating functions|last=Lando|first=Sergei K.|publisher=AMS|ISBN=0-8218-3481-9|chapter=7.4 Multiplicative sequences}}</ref>  In other instances, sequences are often called ''multiplicative'', if ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> = ''na''<sub>1</sub> for all ''n''.  Moreover, a ''multiplicative'' Fibonacci sequence<ref>http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0020739031000158362</ref> satisfies the recursion relation ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> = ''a''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub> ''a''<sub>''n''\u22122</sub>.\n\n==Limits and convergence==\n\n{{Main|Limit of a sequence}}\n\n[[File:Converging Sequence example.svg|320px|thumb|The plot of a convergent sequence (''a<sub>n</sub>'') is shown in blue.  From the graph we can see that the sequence is converging to the limit zero as ''n'' increases.]]\n\nOne of the most important properties of a sequence is ''convergence''.  Informally, a sequence converges, if it has a ''limit''.  Continuing informally, a ([[#Finite and infinite|singly infinite]]) sequence has a limit, if it approaches some value ''L'', called the limit, as ''n'' becomes very large.  That is, for an abstract sequence (''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) (with ''n'' running from 1 to infinity understood) the value of ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> approaches ''L'' as ''n'' \u2192 \u221e, denoted\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} a_n = L.</math>\n\nMore precisely, the sequence converges, if there exists a limit L such that the remaining a<sub>n</sub>'s are arbitrarily close to L for some n large enough.\n\nIf a sequence converges to some limit, then it is '''convergent'''; otherwise it is '''divergent'''.\n\nIf ''a<sub>n</sub>'' gets arbitrarily large as ''n'' \u2192 \u221e, we write\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_n = \\infty.</math>\nIn this case we say that the sequence (''a<sub>n</sub>'') '''diverges''', or that it '''converges to infinity'''.\n\nIf ''a<sub>n</sub>'' gets arbitrarily small (i.e. negative and large in magnitude) as ''n'' \u2192 \u221e, we write\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_n = -\\infty</math>\nand say that the sequence '''diverges''' or '''converges to negative infinity'''.\n\n===Definition of convergence===\nLet <math>(a_n) = (a_n)_{n=1}^\\infty</math> be a sequence of real numbers.  The sequence (''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) is said to '''converge''', if there exists a number ''L'' such that no matter how close we want the ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> to be to ''L'' (say \u03b5-close where \u03b5 > 0), we can find a natural number ''N'' such that all the terms ''a''<sub>''N''</sub>, ''a''<sub>''N+1''</sub>, ... are at least that close to L (within \u03b5 of ''L'').<ref name=\"Gaughan\">{{cite book|title=Introduction to Analysis |last=Gaughan |first=Edward |publisher=AMS (2009)|ISBN=0-8218-4787-2|chapter=1.1 Sequences and Convergence}}</ref>  Worded differently, we say that (''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) '''converges to''' ''L'' if\n:for all \u03b5 > 0, there exists a natural number ''N'' such that for all ''n'' \u2265 ''N'', we have ''L''\u2212\u03b5 < ''a<sub>n</sub>'' < ''L''+\u03b5, \nor equivalently if\n:<math> \\forall \\varepsilon > 0, \\exists N \\in \\mathbf{N} \\text{ s.t. } \\forall n\\geq N, |a_n-L|<\\varepsilon.</math>\n\nIf (''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) is a sequence of complex numbers rather than a sequence of real numbers, then this last formula can still be used to define convergence, with the provision that <math>|\\cdot|</math> denotes the complex modulus, i.e. <math>|z| = \\sqrt{z^*z}</math>.  If (''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) is a sequence of points in a [[metric space]], then the formula can be used to define convergence, if the expression <math>|a_n-L|</math> is replaced by the expression <math>\\text{dist}(a_n, L)</math>, which denotes the [[Metric (mathematics)|distance]] between <math>a_n</math> and <math>L</math>.\n\nIt is not hard to see that, if a sequence converges, then the value it converges to is unique.  This value is called the '''limit''' of the sequence.  The limit of the convergent sequence (''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) is normally denoted <math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_n</math>.  Note that, if (''a''<sub>''n''</sub>) is a non-convergent sequence, then the expression <math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}a_n</math> is meaningless.\n\n===Applications and important results===\nLet <math>(a_n)</math> and <math>(b_n)</math> be convergent sequences, and let <math>(c_n)</math> be a sequence that is not necessarily convergent.

In the graph the sequence appears to be converging to a  limit as the distance between consecutive terms in the sequence gets smaller as ''n'' increases.  In the [[real number]]s every Cauchy sequence converges to some limit.]]\n\nA Cauchy sequence is a sequence whose terms become arbitrarily close together as n gets very large.  The notion of a Cauchy sequence is important in the study of sequences in [[metric spaces]], and, in particular, in [[real analysis]].  One particularly important result in real analysis is ''Cauchy characterization of convergence for sequences'':\n:A sequence of real numbers is convergent (in the reals) if and only if it is Cauchy.\nIn contrast, there are Cauchy sequences of [[rational numbers]] that are not convergent in the rationals, e.g. the sequence defined by\n''x''<sub>1</sub> = 1 and ''x''<sub>''n''+1</sub> = {{sfrac|1=''x''<sub>''n''</sub> + {{sfrac|1=2|2=''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}}|2=2}}\nis Cauchy, but has no rational limit, cf. [[Cauchy sequence#Counter-example: rational numbers|here]].  More generally, any sequence of rational numbers that converges to an [[irrational number]] is Cauchy, but not convergent when interpreted as a sequence in the set of rational numbers.\n\nMetric spaces that satisfy the Cauchy characterization of convergence for sequences are called [[complete metric space]]s and are particularly nice for analysis.\n\n==Series==\n{{main|Series (mathematics)}}\nA '''series''' is, informally speaking, the sum of the terms of a sequence.  That is, it is an expression of the form <math>\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty a_n</math> or <math>a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots</math>, where <math>(a_n)</math> is a sequence of real or complex numbers.  The '''partial sums''' of a series are the expressions resulting from replacing the infinity symbol with a finite number, i.e. the ''N''th partial sum of the series <math>\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty a_n</math> is the number <math>S_N = \\sum_{n = 1}^N a_n</math>, i.e.\n:<math> S_N = a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_N. </math>\nThe partial sums themselves form a sequence <math>(S_N)_{N\\in\\mathbb N}</math>, which is called the '''sequence of partial sums''' of the series <math>\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty a_n</math>.  If the sequence of partial sums converges, then we say that the series <math>\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty a_n</math> is '''convergent''', and the limit <math>\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} S_N</math> is called the '''value''' of the series.  The same notation is used to denote a series and its value, i.e. we write <math>\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty a_n = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} S_N</math>.\n\n==Use in other fields of mathematics==\n\n=== Topology ===\nSequences play an important role in topology, especially in the study of [[metric spaces]].  For instance:\n* A [[metric space]] is [[compact space|compact]] exactly when it is [[sequential compactness|sequentially compact]].\n* A function from a metric space to another metric space is [[continuous function|continuous]] exactly when it takes convergent sequences to convergent sequences.\n* A metric space is a [[connected space]] if and only if, whenever the space is partitioned into two sets, one of the two sets contains a sequence converging to a point in the other set.\n* A [[topological space]] is [[separable space|separable]] exactly when there is a dense sequence of points.\n\nSequences can be generalized to [[net (mathematics)|nets]] or [[filter (mathematics)|filters]].  These generalizations allow one to extend some of the above theorems to spaces without metrics.\n\n====Product topology====\nThe [[product topology|topological product]] of a sequence of topological spaces is the [[cartesian product]] of those spaces, equipped with a [[natural topology]] called the [[product topology]].\n\nMore formally, given a sequence of spaces <math>(X_i)_{i\\in\\mathbb N}</math>, the product space\n\n:<math>X := \\prod_{i \\in I} X_i, </math>\n\nis defined as the set of all sequences <math>(x_i)_{i\\in\\mathbb N}</math> such that for each ''i'', <math>x_i</math> is an element of <math>X_i</math>.  The '''[[projection (set theory)|canonical projections]]''' are the maps ''p<sub>i</sub>'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''X<sub>i</sub>'' defined by the equation <math>p_i((x_j)_{j\\in\\mathbb N}) = x_i</math>.  Then the '''product topology''' on ''X'' is defined to be the [[coarsest topology]] (i.e. the topology with the fewest open sets) for which all the projections ''p<sub>i</sub>'' are [[continuous (topology)|continuous]].  The product topology is sometimes called the '''Tychonoff topology'''.\n\n===Analysis===\nIn [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], when talking about sequences, one will generally consider sequences of the form\n:<math>(x_1, x_2, x_3, \\dots)\\text{ or }(x_0, x_1, x_2, \\dots)\\, </math>\nwhich is to say, infinite sequences of elements indexed by [[natural number]]s.\n\nIt may be convenient to have the sequence start with an index different from 1 or 0.  For example, the sequence defined by ''x<sub>n</sub>'' = 1/[[logarithm|log]](''n'') would be defined only for ''n'' \u2265 2.  When talking about such infinite sequences, it is usually sufficient (and does not change much for most considerations) to assume that the members of the sequence are defined at least for all indices [[large enough]], that is, greater than some given ''N''.\n\nThe most elementary type of sequences are numerical ones, that is, sequences of [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] numbers.  This type can be generalized to sequences of elements of some [[vector space]].  In analysis, the vector spaces considered are often [[function space]]s.  Even more generally, one can study sequences with elements in some [[topological space]].\n\n====Sequence spaces====\n{{main|Sequence space}}\nA [[sequence space]] is a [[vector space]] whose elements are infinite sequences of [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] numbers.  Equivalently, it is a [[function space]] whose elements are functions from the [[natural numbers]] to the field '''K''', where '''K''' is either the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers.  The set of all such functions is naturally identified with the set of all possible infinite sequences with elements in '''K''', and can be turned into a [[vector space]] under the operations of [[pointwise addition]] of functions and pointwise scalar multiplication.  All sequence spaces are [[linear subspace]]s of this space.  Sequence spaces are typically equipped with a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], or at least the structure of a [[topological vector space]].\n\nThe most important sequences spaces in analysis are the \u2113<sup>''p''</sup> spaces, consisting of the ''p''-power summable sequences, with the ''p''-norm.  These are special cases of [[Lp space|L<sup>''p''</sup> spaces]] for the [[counting measure]] on the set of natural numbers.  Other important classes of sequences like convergent sequences or [[#c and c0|null sequence]]s form sequence spaces, respectively denoted ''c'' and ''c''<sub>0</sub>, with the sup norm.  Any sequence space can also be equipped with the [[topology]] of [[pointwise convergence]], under which it becomes a special kind of [[Fr\u00e9chet space]] called an [[FK-space]].\n\n=== Linear algebra ===\nSequences over a field may also be viewed as [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]] in a [[vector space]].  Specifically, the set of ''F''-valued sequences (where ''F'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]]) is a [[function space]] (in fact, a [[product space]]) of ''F''-valued functions over the set of natural numbers.\n\n===Abstract algebra===\nAbstract algebra employs several types of sequences, including sequences of mathematical objects such as groups or rings.\n\n====Free monoid====\n{{main|Free monoid}}\nIf ''A'' is a set, the [[free monoid]] over ''A'' (denoted ''A''<sup>*</sup>, also called [[Kleene star]] of ''A'') is a [[monoid]] containing all the finite sequences (or strings) of zero or more elements of ''A'', with the binary operation of concatenation.  The [[free semigroup]] ''A''<sup>+</sup> is the subsemigroup of ''A''<sup>*</sup> containing all elements except the empty sequence.\n\n====Exact sequences====\n{{main|Exact sequence}}\nIn the context of [[group theory]], a sequence\n:<math>G_0 \\;\\xrightarrow{f_1}\\; G_1 \\;\\xrightarrow{f_2}\\; G_2 \\;\\xrightarrow{f_3}\\; \\cdots \\;\\xrightarrow{f_n}\\; G_n</math>\nof [[group (mathematics)|groups]] and [[group homomorphism]]s is called '''exact''', if the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] (or [[Range (mathematics)|range]]) of each homomorphism is equal to the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of the next:\n:<math>\\mathrm{im}(f_k) = \\mathrm{ker}(f_{k+1})</math>\n\nNote that the sequence of groups and homomorphisms may be either finite or infinite.\n\nA similar definition can be made for certain other [[algebraic structure]]s.  For example, one could have an exact sequence of [[vector space]]s and [[linear map]]s, or of [[module (mathematics)|modules]] and [[module homomorphism]]s.\n\n====Spectral sequences====\n{{main|Spectral sequence}}\nIn [[homological algebra]] and [[algebraic topology]], a '''spectral sequence''' is a means of computing homology groups by taking successive approximations.  Spectral sequences are a generalization of [[exact sequence]]s, and since their introduction by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Jean Leray|first=Jean|last=Leray|year=1946}}, they have become an important research tool, particularly in [[homotopy theory]].\n\n===Set theory===\nAn [[Order topology#Ordinal-indexed sequences|ordinal-indexed sequence]] is a generalization of a sequence.  If \u03b1 is a [[limit ordinal]] and ''X'' is a set, an \u03b1-indexed sequence of elements of ''X'' is a function from \u03b1 to ''X''.  In this terminology an \u03c9-indexed sequence is an ordinary sequence.\n\n=== Computing ===\n[[Automata theory|Automata]] or [[finite state machine]]s can typically be thought of as directed graphs, with edges labeled using some specific alphabet, \u03a3.  Most familiar types of automata transition from state to state by reading input letters from \u03a3, following edges with matching labels; the ordered input for such an automaton forms a sequence called a ''word'' (or input word).  The sequence of states encountered by the automaton when processing a word is called a ''run''.  A [[Nondeterministic finite automaton|nondeterministic automaton]] may have unlabeled or duplicate out-edges for any state, giving more than one successor for some input letter.  This is typically thought of as producing multiple possible runs for a given word, each being a sequence of single states, rather than producing a single run that is a sequence of sets of states; however, 'run' is occasionally used to mean the latter.\n\n=== Streams ===\nInfinite sequences of [[numerical digit|digits]] (or [[character (computing)|characters]]) drawn from a [[finite set|finite]] [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] are of particular interest in [[theoretical computer science]].  They are often referred to simply as ''sequences'' or ''[[Stream (computing)|streams]]'', as opposed to finite ''[[String (computer science)#Formal theory|strings]]''.  Infinite binary sequences, for instance, are infinite sequences of [[bit]]s (characters drawn from the alphabet {0, 1}).  The set ''C'' = {0, 1}<sup>\u221e</sup> of all infinite binary sequences is sometimes called the [[Cantor space]].\n\nAn infinite binary sequence can represent a [[formal language]] (a set of strings) by setting the ''n''&thinsp;th bit of the sequence to 1 if and only if the ''n''&thinsp;th string (in [[shortlex order]]) is in the language.  This representation is useful in the [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonalization method]] for proofs.<ref name=Oflazer2011>{{cite web|last1=Oflazer|first1=Kemal|title=FORMAL LANGUAGES, AUTOMATA AND COMPUTATION: DECIDABILITY|url=http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/ko/pdfs/lecture-15.pdf|website=cmu.edu|publisher=Carnegie-Mellon University|accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Enumeration]]\n* [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]]\n* [[Recurrence relation]]\n* [[Sequence space]]\n\n;Operations\n* [[Cauchy product]]\n\n;Examples\n* [[Discrete-time signal]]\n* [[Farey sequence]]\n* [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]]\n* [[Look-and-say sequence]]\n* [[Thue\u2013Morse sequence]]\n\n;Types\n* [[\u00b11-sequence]]\n* [[Arithmetic progression]]\n* [[Automatic sequence]]\n* [[Cauchy sequence]]\n* [[Constant-recursive sequence]]\n* [[Geometric progression]]\n* [[holonomic function|Holonomic sequence]]\n* [[k-regular sequence|Regular sequence]]\n\n;Related concepts\n* [[List (computing)]]\n* [[Net (topology)]] (a generalization of sequences)\n* [[Order topology#Ordinal-indexed sequences|Ordinal-indexed sequence]]\n* [[Recursion (computer science)]]\n* [[Set (mathematics)]]\n* [[Tuple]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary|enumerate|collection}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n* {{springer|title=Sequence|id=p/s084550}}\n* [http://oeis.org/ The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]\n* [http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/index.html Journal of Integer Sequences] (free)\n*{{planetmath reference|id=397|title=Sequence}}\n\n{{Series (mathematics)}}\n\n[[Category:Elementary mathematics]]\n[[Category:Sequences and series|*]]"}]}}}}
