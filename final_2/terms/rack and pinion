A circular gear called \"the [[pinion]]\" engages teeth on a linear \"gear\" bar called \"the rack\"; [[rotation]]al motion applied to the pinion causes the rack to move relative to the pinion, thereby translating the rotational motion of the pinion into linear motion.\n\nFor example, in a [[rack railway]], the rotation of a pinion mounted on a [[locomotive]] or a [[railcar]] engages a [[Rack railway#Rack systems|rack]] between the rails and forces a [[train]] up a steep slope.\n\nFor every pair of conjugate involute profile, there is a basic rack. This basic rack is the profile of the conjugate gear of infinite pitch radius.<ref name=\"agma\">{{cite book|isbn=1-55589-846-7|oclc=65562739|title=Gear Nomenclature, Definition of Terms with Symbols|pages=72|id=ANSI/AGMA 1012-G05|publisher=[[American Gear Manufacturers Association]]}}</ref> (I.e. a toothed straight edge.)\n\nA generating rack is a rack outline used to indicate tooth details and dimensions for the design of a generating tool, such as a hob or a gear shaper cutter.<ref name=\"agma\"/>\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Lock gate cogs, Montgomery Canal - geograph.org.uk - 1806427.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lock gate]] controls on a [[canal]]]]\nRack and pinion combinations are often used as part of a simple [[linear actuator]], where the rotation of a shaft powered by hand or by a motor is converted to linear motion.\n\nThe rack carries the full load of the actuator directly and so the driving pinion is usually small, so that the [[gear ratio]] reduces the torque required. This force, thus torque, may still be substantial and so it is common for there to be a reduction gear immediately before this by either a gear or [[worm gear]] reduction. Rack gears have a higher ratio, thus require a greater driving torque, than screw actuators.\n{{-}}\n===Stairlifts===\nMost Stairlifts today are operating using the Rack & Pinion system.\n\n=== Steering ===\n[[File:Steer system.jpg|right|thumb|Rack steering in an automobile]]\nA rack and pinion is commonly found in the [[steering]] mechanism of [[automobile|car]]s or other [[wheel]]ed, steered vehicles. Rack and pinion provides a less efficient [[mechanical advantage]] than other mechanisms such as [[recirculating ball]], but less [[backlash (gear)|backlash]] and greater [[feedback]], or steering \"feel\". The mechanism may be power-assisted, usually by hydraulic or electrical means.\n\nThe use of a variable rack (still using a normal pinion) was invented by [[Arthur Ernest Bishop]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Rack and pinion variable ratio steering gear|publisher=Google Patent Search|url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT3753378&id=bTEwAAAAEBAJ&dq=pinion+%2Bininventor:Arthur+ininventor:E+ininventor:Bishop&jtp=1|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref> in the 1970s, so as to improve vehicle response and steering \"feel,\" especially at high speeds. He also created a low cost [[Forging|press forging]] process to manufacture the racks, eliminating the need to machine the gear teeth.\n{{Commons category| Rack and pinion steering|position=left}}\n{{-}}\n\n=== Rack railways ===\n[[File:Budape\u0161\u0165, V\u00e1rosmajor, pomn\u00edk zuba\u010dky.jpg|thumb|Rack railway axle]]\n{{details|Rack railway}}\n[[Rack railway]]s are [[mountain railway]]s that use a rack built into the centre of the track and a pinion on their locomotives. This allows them to work on steep gradients, up to 1 in 2 (50%), far in excess of those a conventional railway relying on friction alone can achieve.\n\nAlthough the extra grip of the rack system is obviously important for climbing, it has perhaps a more important use in also allowing controlled braking on these steep lines and for being much less affected by snow or ice on the rails.\n{{Commons category|Rack and pinion (railway)|position=left}}\n{{-}}\n\n=== Actuators ===\n[[File:Pneumatic Rack and Pinion Actuators.JPG|thumb|upright|Pneumatic rack and pinion actuators]]\n\nA rack and pinion with two racks and one pinion is used in [[actuator]]s. An example is pneumatic rack and pinion actuators that can be used to control valves in [[pipeline transport]]. The actuators in the picture on the right are used to control the valves of large water pipeline. In the top actuator, a gray control signal line can be seen connecting to a [[solenoid valve]] (the small black box attached to the back of the top actuator), which is used as the pilot for the actuator. The solenoid valve controls the air pressure coming from the input air line (the small green tube). The output air from the solenoid valve is fed to the chamber in the middle of the actuator, increasing the pressure. The pressure in the actuator's chamber pushes the pistons away. While the pistons are moving apart from each other, the attached racks are also moved along the pistons in the opposite directions of the two racks. The two racks are meshed to a pinion at the direct opposite teeth of the pinion. When the two racks move, the pinion is turned, causing the attached main valve of the water pipe to turn.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Role of Rack and Pinion Actuators in On-Off & Modulating Controls|journal=Valve Magazine|issue=Spring 2010|accessdate=7 July 2014|publisher=Valve Manufacturers Association}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Automax SuperNova Series Pneumatic Rack & Pinion Actuators|url=http://www.flowserve.com/files/Files/Literature/ProductLiterature/FlowControl/Automax/AXENBR1001.pdf|publisher=Flowserve Corporation|accessdate=7 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Technology}}\n* [[List of gear nomenclature]]\n* [[Sprocket]]\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Rack gears}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Gears}}\n{{Powertrain}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rack and Pinion}}\n[[Category:Machines]]\n[[Category:Kinematics]]\n[[Category:Automotive steering technologies]]\n[[Category:Gears]]\n[[Category:Actuators]]"}]}}}}
