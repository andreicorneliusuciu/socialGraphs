At resonant frequencies, small [[Periodic function|periodic]] driving forces have the ability to produce large amplitude oscillations. This is because the system stores [[vibrational energy]].\n\nResonance occurs when a system is able to store and easily transfer energy between two or more different storage modes (such as kinetic energy and potential energy in the case of a pendulum). However, there are some losses from cycle to cycle, called [[damping]]. When damping is small, the resonant frequency is approximately equal to the [[natural frequency]] of the system, which is a frequency of unforced vibrations. Some systems have multiple, distinct, resonant frequencies.\n\nResonance phenomena occur with all types of vibrations or [[wave|waves]]: there is [[mechanical resonance]], [[acoustic resonance]], [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] resonance, [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), [[electron paramagnetic resonance|electron spin resonance]] (ESR) and resonance of quantum [[wave function]]s. Resonant systems can be used to generate vibrations of a specific frequency (e.g., [[musical instrument]]s), or pick out specific frequencies from a complex vibration containing many frequencies (e.g., filters).\n\nThe term ''resonance'' (from [[Latin]] ''resonantia'', 'echo', from ''resonare'', 'resound') originates from the field of acoustics, particularly observed in musical instruments, e.g., when strings started to vibrate and to produce sound without direct excitation by the player.\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:Little girl on swing.jpg|thumb|280px|Pushing a person in a [[swing (seat)|swing]] is a common example of resonance. The loaded swing, a [[pendulum]], has a [[natural frequency]] of oscillation, its resonant frequency, and resists being pushed at a faster or slower rate.]]\n\nA familiar example is a playground [[Swing (seat)|swing]], which acts as a [[pendulum]]. Pushing a person in a swing in time with the natural interval of the swing (its resonant frequency) makes the swing go higher and higher (maximum amplitude), while attempts to push the swing at a faster or slower tempo produce smaller arcs. This is because the energy the swing absorbs is maximized when the pushes are \"in [[phase (waves)|phase]]\" with the swing's natural oscillations, while some of the swing's energy is actually extracted by the opposing force of the pushes when they are not.\n\nResonance occurs widely in nature, and is exploited in many manmade devices. It is the mechanism by which virtually all [[sinusoidal]] [[wave]]s and vibrations are generated. Many sounds we hear, such as when hard objects of [[metal]], [[glass]], or [[wood]] are struck, are caused by brief resonant vibrations in the object. Light and other short wavelength [[electromagnetic radiation]] is produced by resonance on an [[Atomic spacing|atomic scale]], such as [[electron]]s in atoms. Other examples are:\n* Timekeeping mechanisms of modern clocks and watches, e.g., the [[balance wheel]] in a mechanical [[watch]] and the [[quartz crystal]] in a [[quartz watch]]\n* [[Tidal resonance]] of the [[Bay of Fundy]]\n* [[Acoustic resonance]]s of [[musical instruments]] and the human [[vocal tract]]\n* Shattering of a crystal wineglass when exposed to a musical tone of the right pitch (its resonant frequency)\n* [[Friction idiophone]]s, such as making a glass object (glass, bottle, vase) [[vibration|vibrate]] by rubbing around its rim with a fingertip\n* [[Electrical resonance]] of [[tuned circuit]]s in [[radio]]s and [[TV]]s that allow radio frequencies to be selectively received\n* Creation of [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] light by [[optical resonance]] in a [[laser]] [[Optical cavity|cavity]]\n* [[Orbital resonance]] as exemplified by some [[natural satellite|moons]] of the [[solar system]]'s [[gas giants]]\n* Material resonances in atomic scale are the basis of several [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] techniques that are used in [[condensed matter physics]]\n**[[Electron spin resonance]]\n**[[M\u00f6ssbauer effect]]\n**[[Nuclear magnetic resonance]]\n\n==Theory==\n[[File:Universal Resonance Curve.svg|thumb|right|350px|\"Universal Resonance Curve\", a symmetric approximation to the normalized response of a resonant circuit; [[abscissa]] values are deviation from center frequency, in units of center frequency divided by 2Q; [[ordinate]] is relative amplitude, and phase in cycles; dashed curves compare the range of responses of real two-pole circuits for a ''Q'' value of 5; for higher ''Q'' values, there is less deviation from the universal curve. Crosses mark the edges of the 3&nbsp;dB bandwidth (gain 0.707, phase shift 45\u00b0 or 0.125 cycle).]]\n\nThe exact response of a resonance, especially for frequencies far from the resonant frequency, depends on the details of the physical system, and is usually not exactly symmetric about the resonant frequency, as illustrated for the [[simple harmonic oscillator]] above.\nFor a lightly [[damping|damped]] linear oscillator with a resonance frequency ''\u03a9'', the ''intensity'' of oscillations ''I'' when the system is driven with a driving frequency ''\u03c9'' is typically approximated by a formula that is symmetric about the resonance frequency:<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = Lasers\n | author = A.

This is a [[Lorentzian function]], or [[Cauchy distribution]], and this response is found in many physical situations involving resonant systems. ''\u0393'' is a parameter dependent on the [[harmonic oscillator|damping]] of the oscillator, and is known as the ''linewidth'' of the resonance. Heavily damped oscillators tend to have broad linewidths, and respond to a wider range of driving frequencies around the resonant frequency. The linewidth is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|inversely proportional]] to the [[Q factor|''Q'' factor]], which is a measure of the sharpness of the resonance.\n\nIn [[electrical engineering]], this approximate symmetric response is known as the ''universal resonance curve'', a concept introduced by [[Frederick E. Terman]] in 1932 to simplify the approximate analysis of radio circuits with a range of center frequencies and ''Q'' values.<ref>{{cite book | title = Radio Engineering | author = Frederick Emmons Terman | publisher = McGraw-Hill Book Company | year = 1932 | url = https://books.google.com/books?d=8rE8AAAAIAAJ&q=inauthor:terman+inauthor:frederick+universal&dq=inauthor:terman+inauthor:frederick+universal\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = Circuits, Signals, and Systems | author = William McC.

Systems with one degree of freedom, such as a mass on a spring, [[pendulum]]s, [[balance wheel]]s, and [[RLC circuit|LC tuned circuits]] have one resonant frequency. Systems with two degrees of freedom, such as [[Double pendulum|coupled pendulums]] and [[resonant transformer]]s can have two resonant frequencies. As the number of coupled harmonic oscillators grows, the time it takes to transfer energy from one to the next becomes significant. The vibrations in them begin to travel through the coupled harmonic oscillators in waves, from one oscillator to the next.\n\nExtended objects that can experience resonance due to vibrations inside them are called [[resonator]]s, such as [[organ pipe]]s, [[vibrating string]]s, [[quartz crystal]]s, [[microwave]] and [[laser]] [[Resonators#Cavity resonators|cavities]]. Since these can be viewed as being made of millions of coupled moving parts (such as [[atom]]s), they can have millions of resonant frequencies. The vibrations inside them travel as waves, at an approximately constant velocity, bouncing back and forth between the sides of the resonator. If the distance between the sides is ''d'', the length of a roundtrip is 2''d''. To cause resonance, the phase of a [[sinusoidal]] wave after a roundtrip must be equal to the initial phase, so the waves reinforce the oscillation. So the condition for resonance in a resonator is that the roundtrip distance, 2''d'', be equal to an [[integer]] number of wavelengths ''\u03bb'' of the wave:\n\n:<math>2d = N\\lambda,\\qquad\\qquad N \\in \\{1,2,3,\\dots\\}</math>\n\nIf the velocity of a wave is ''v'', the frequency is ''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|''v''|''\u03bb''}} so the resonant frequencies are:\n\n:<math>f = \\frac{Nv}{2d}\\qquad\\qquad N \\in \\{1,2,3,\\dots\\}</math>\n\nSo the resonant frequencies of resonators, called [[normal modes]], are equally spaced multiples of a lowest frequency called the [[fundamental frequency]]. The multiples are often called [[overtone]]s. There may be several such series of resonant frequencies, corresponding to different modes of oscillation.\n\n==''Q'' factor==\n{{Main|Q factor}}\nThe [[Q factor|''Q'' factor]] or ''quality factor'' is a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]] parameter that describes how [[damping|under-damped]] an [[oscillation|oscillator]] or [[resonator]] is,<ref>{{cite book | title = Electric Power Transformer Engineering | author = James H.

A pendulum suspended from a high-quality bearing, oscillating in air, has a high ''Q'', while a pendulum immersed in oil has a low ''Q''. To sustain a system in resonance in constant amplitude by providing power externally, the energy provided in each cycle must be less than the energy stored in the system (i.e., the sum of the potential and kinetic) by a factor of {{sfrac|''Q''|2{{pi}}}}. Oscillators with high-quality factors have low [[damping]], which tends to make them ring longer.\n\n[[sine wave|Sinusoidally]] driven [[resonator]]s having higher Q factors resonate with greater amplitudes (at the resonant frequency) but have a smaller range of frequencies around the frequency at which they resonate. The range of frequencies at which the oscillator resonates is called the bandwidth. Thus, a high-''Q'' [[RLC circuit|tuned circuit]] in a radio receiver would be more difficult to tune, but would have greater [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]], it would do a better job of filtering out signals from other stations that lie nearby on the spectrum. High Q oscillators operate over a smaller range of frequencies and are more stable. (See [[oscillator phase noise]].)\n\nThe quality factor of oscillators varies substantially from system to system. Systems for which damping is important (such as dampers keeping a door from slamming shut) have ''Q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}}. Clocks, lasers, and other systems that need either strong resonance or high frequency stability need high-quality factors. [[Tuning fork]]s have quality factors around ''Q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1000. The quality factor of [[atomic clock]]s and some high-''Q'' [[optical cavity|lasers]] can reach as high as 10<sup>11</sup><ref>[http://www.rp-photonics.com/q_factor.html Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology: ''Q'' factor]</ref> and higher.<ref>[http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm Time and Frequency from A to Z: Q to Ra]</ref>\n\nThere are many alternate quantities used by physicists and engineers to describe how damped an oscillator is that are closely related to its quality factor. Important examples include: the [[damping ratio]], [[bandwidth (signal processing)|relative bandwidth]], [[oscillator linewidth|linewidth]], and bandwidth measured in [[Octave (electronics)|octave]]s.\n\n==Types of resonance==\n\n===Mechanical and acoustic resonance===\n{{Main|Mechanical resonance|Acoustic resonance|String resonance}}\n\n[[Mechanical resonance]] is the tendency of a [[mechanics|mechanical system]] to absorb more energy when the [[frequency]] of its oscillations matches the system's [[natural frequency]] of [[vibration]] than it does at other frequencies. It may cause violent swaying motions and even catastrophic failure in improperly constructed structures including [[Bridge engineering|bridges]], buildings, trains, and aircraft. When designing objects, [[engineers]]  must ensure the mechanical resonance frequencies of the component parts do not match driving vibrational frequencies of motors or other oscillating parts, a phenomenon known as [[mechanical resonance#Resonance disaster|resonance disaster]].\n\nAvoiding resonance disasters is a major concern in every building, tower, and [[bridge]] [[construction]] project. As a countermeasure, [[shock mount]]s can be installed to absorb resonant frequencies and thus dissipate the absorbed energy. The [[Taipei 101]] building relies on a {{convert|660|t|ST|adj=mid|[[pendulum]]}}\u2014a [[tuned mass damper]]\u2014to cancel resonance. Furthermore, the structure is designed to resonate at a frequency that does not typically occur. Buildings in [[seismic]] zones are often constructed to take into account the oscillating frequencies of expected ground motion. In addition, [[engineer]]s designing objects having engines must ensure that the mechanical resonant frequencies of the component parts do not match driving vibrational frequencies of the motors or other strongly oscillating parts.\n\n[[Clock]]s keep time by mechanical resonance in a [[balance wheel]], [[pendulum]], or [[Quartz clock|quartz crystal]].\n\nThe cadence of runners has been hypothesized to be energetically favorable due to resonance between the elastic energy stored in the lower limb and the mass of the runner.<ref name=\"Snyder and Farley.

For humans, hearing is normally limited to frequencies between about 20&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] and 20,000&nbsp;Hz (20&nbsp;[[kHz]]),<ref>[[Harry F. Olson]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=RUDTFBbb7jAC&pg=PA248 ''Music, Physics and Engineering.''] Dover Publications, 1967, pp. 248\u2013249. \"Under very favorable conditions most individuals can obtain tonal characteristics as low as 12 Hz.\"</ref>\n\nAcoustic resonance is an important consideration for instrument builders, as most acoustic [[Musical instrument|instruments]] use [[resonator]]s, such as the [[string resonance|strings]] and body of a [[violin]], the length of tube in a [[flute]], and the shape of, and tension on, a drum membrane.\n\nLike mechanical resonance, acoustic resonance can result in catastrophic failure of the object at resonance. The classic example of this is breaking a wine glass with sound at the precise resonant frequency of the glass, although this is difficult in practice.<ref>[http://www.physics.ucla.edu/demoweb/demomanual/acoustics/effects_of_sound/breaking_glass_with_sound.html Breaking Glass with Sound<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Electrical resonance===\n\n{{Main|Electrical resonance}}\n[[Electrical resonance]] occurs in an [[electrical network|electric circuit]] at a particular ''resonant frequency'' when the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the circuit is at a minimum in a series circuit or at maximum in a parallel circuit (or when the [[transfer function]] is at a maximum).\n\n===Optical resonance===\n\n{{Main|Optical cavity}}\n\nAn [[optical cavity]], also called an ''optical resonator'', is an arrangement of [[mirror]]s that forms a [[standing wave]] [[cavity resonator]] for [[light wave]]s. Optical cavities are a major component of [[laser]]s, surrounding the [[gain medium]] and providing [[feedback]] of the laser light. They are also used in [[optical parametric oscillator]]s and some [[interferometer]]s. Light confined in the cavity reflects multiple times producing standing waves for certain resonant frequencies. The standing wave patterns produced are called \"modes\". [[Longitudinal mode]]s differ only in frequency while [[transverse mode]]s differ for different frequencies and have different intensity patterns across the cross-section of the beam. [[Optical ring resonators|Ring resonators]] and [[Whispering gallery|whispering galleries]] are examples of optical resonators that do not form standing waves.\n\nDifferent resonator types are distinguished by the focal lengths of the two mirrors and the distance between them; flat mirrors are not often used because of the difficulty of aligning them precisely. The geometry (resonator type) must be chosen so the beam remains stable, i.e., the beam size does not continue to grow with each reflection. Resonator types are also designed to meet other criteria such as minimum beam waist or having no focal point (and therefore intense light at that point) inside the cavity.\n\nOptical cavities are designed to have a very large [[Q factor|''Q'' factor]].<ref>[http://www.rp-photonics.com/q_factor.html Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology - ''Q'' factor, quality factor, cavity, resonator, oscillator, frequency standards<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A beam reflects a large number of times with little [[attenuation]]\u2014therefore the frequency [[line width]] of the beam is small compared to the frequency of the laser.\n\nAdditional optical resonances are [[guided-mode resonance]]s and [[surface plasmon resonance]], which result in anomalous reflection and high evanescent fields at resonance. In this case, the resonant modes are guided modes of a waveguide or surface plasmon modes of a dielectric-metallic interface. These modes are usually excited by a subwavelength grating.\n\n===Orbital resonance===\n\n{{Main|Orbital resonance}}\n\nIn [[celestial mechanics]], an [[orbital resonance]] occurs when two [[orbit]]ing bodies exert a regular, periodic gravitational influence on each other, usually due to their [[orbital period]]s being related by a ratio of two small integers. Orbital resonances greatly enhance the mutual gravitational influence of the bodies. In most cases, this results in an ''unstable'' interaction, in which the bodies exchange momentum and shift orbits until the resonance no longer exists. Under some circumstances, a resonant system can be stable and self-correcting, so that the bodies remain in resonance. Examples are the 1:2:4 resonance of [[Jupiter]]'s moons [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], and [[Io (moon)|Io]], and the 2:3 resonance between [[Pluto]] and [[Neptune]]. Unstable resonances with [[Saturn]]'s inner moons give rise to gaps in the [[rings of Saturn]]. The special case of 1:1 resonance (between bodies with similar orbital radii) causes large Solar System bodies to [[Clearing the neighbourhood|clear the neighborhood]] around their orbits by ejecting nearly everything else around them; this effect is used in the current [[definition of planet|definition of a planet]].\n\n=== Atomic, particle, and molecular resonance ===\n\n{{Main|Nuclear magnetic resonance|Resonance (particle physics)}}\n\n[[File:HWB-NMR - 900MHz - 21.2 Tesla.jpg|thumb|right|300px|NMR Magnet at HWB-NMR, Birmingham, UK. In its strong 21.2-[[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] field, the proton resonance is at 900&nbsp;MHz.]]\n[[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) is the name given to a physical resonance phenomenon involving the observation of specific [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[magnetism|magnetic]] properties of an [[atom]]ic [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] in the presence of an applied, external magnetic field. Many scientific techniques exploit NMR phenomena to study [[molecular physics]], [[crystallography|crystal]]s, and non-crystalline materials through [[NMR spectroscopy]]. NMR is also routinely used in advanced medical imaging techniques, such as in [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI).\n\nAll nuclei containing odd numbers of [[nucleon]]s have an intrinsic [[magnetic moment]] and [[angular momentum]]. A key feature of NMR is that the resonant frequency of a particular substance is directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field. It is this feature that is exploited in imaging techniques; if a sample is placed in a non-uniform magnetic field then the resonant frequencies of the sample's nuclei depend on where in the field they are located. Therefore, the particle can be located quite precisely by its resonant frequency.\n\n[[Electron paramagnetic resonance]], otherwise known as ''Electron Spin Resonance'' (ESR) is a spectroscopic technique similar to NMR, but uses unpaired electrons instead. Materials for which this can be applied are much more limited since the material needs to both have an unpaired spin and be [[paramagnetic]].\n\nThe [[M\u00f6ssbauer effect]] is the resonant and [[recoil]]-free emission and absorption of [[gamma ray]] photons by atoms bound in a solid form.\n\n[[Resonance (particle physics)|Resonance in particle physics]] appears in similar circumstances to [[classical physics]] at the level of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]]. However, they can also be thought of as unstable particles, with the formula above valid if ''\u0393'' is the [[Particle decay#Decay rate|decay rate]] and ''\u03a9'' replaced by the particle's mass ''M''. In that case, the formula comes from the particle's [[Propagator (Quantum Theory)|propagator]], with its mass replaced by the [[complex number]] ''M''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''i\u0393''. The formula is further related to the particle's [[Particle decay#Decay rate|decay rate]] by the [[optical theorem]].\n\n===Tacoma Narrows Bridge===\n{{Main|Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)}}\n\nThe dramatically visible, rhythmic twisting that resulted in the 1940 collapse of \"Galloping Gertie\", the original [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge]], is misleadingly characterized as an example of resonance phenomenon in certain textbooks. The catastrophic vibrations that destroyed the bridge were not due to simple mechanical resonance, but to a more complicated interaction between the bridge and the winds passing through it\u2014a phenomenon known as [[aeroelasticity#Flutter|aeroelastic flutter]], which is a kind of \"self-sustaining vibration\" as referred to in the nonlinear theory of vibrations.
