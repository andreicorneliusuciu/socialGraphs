[[Electric current]]s and the [[magnetic moment]]s of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments.   The most familiar effects occur in [[ferromagnetic]] materials, which are strongly attracted by magnetic fields and can be [[magnetization|magnetized]] to become permanent [[magnet]]s, producing magnetic fields themselves.  Only a few substances are ferromagnetic; the most common ones are [[iron]], [[nickel]] and [[cobalt]] and their alloys.  The prefix ''{{linktext|ferro-}}'' refers to [[iron]], because permanent magnetism was first observed in [[lodestone]], a form of natural iron ore called [[magnetite]], Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.\n\nAlthough ferromagnetism is responsible for most of the effects of magnetism encountered in everyday life, all other materials are influenced to some extent by a magnetic field, by several other types of magnetism. [[Paramagnetism|Paramagnetic]] substances such as [[aluminum]] and [[oxygen]] are weakly attracted to an applied magnetic field;  [[Diamagnetism|diamagnetic]] substances such as [[copper]] and [[carbon]] are weakly repelled; while [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] materials such as [[chromium]] and [[spin glass]]es have a more complex relationship with a magnetic field.  The force of a magnet on paramagnetic, diamagnetic, antiferromagnetic materials is usually too weak to be felt, and can only be detected by laboratory instruments, so in everyday life these substances are often described as non-magnetic.\n\nThe magnetic state (or magnetic phase) of a material depends on temperature and other variables such as pressure and the applied magnetic field. A material may exhibit more than one form of magnetism as these variables change.\n\n== History ==\n{{main article|History of electromagnetism}}\n[[File:Lodestone attracting nails.png|thumb|upright|[[Lodestone]], a natural [[magnet]], attracting iron nails.

They sculpted a directional spoon from lodestone in such a way that the handle of the spoon always pointed south.\n\n[[Alexander Neckam]], by 1187, was the first in Europe to describe the compass and its use for navigation. In 1269, [[Peter of Maricourt|Peter Peregrinus de Maricourt]] wrote the ''Epistola de magnete'', the first extant treatise describing the properties of magnets. In 1282, the properties of magnets and the dry compass were discussed by Al-Ashraf, a [[Islamic physics|Yemeni physicist]], [[Islamic astronomy|astronomer]], and [[Islamic geography|geographer]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Two Early Arabic Sources On The Magnetic Compass|first=Petra G.|last=Schmidl|journal=Journal of Arabic and Islamic Studies|year=1996\u20131997|volume=1|pages=81\u2013132}}</ref>\n\nIn 1600, [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] published his ''[[De Magnete|De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure]]'' (''On the Magnet and Magnetic Bodies, and on the Great Magnet the Earth''). In this work he describes many of his experiments with his model earth called the [[terrella]]. From his experiments, he concluded that the [[Earth's magnetic field|Earth]] was itself magnetic and that this was the reason compasses pointed north (previously, some believed that it was the pole star ([[Polaris]]) or a large magnetic island on the north pole that attracted the compass).\n\nAn understanding of the relationship between [[electricity]] and magnetism began in 1819 with work by [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]], a professor at the University of Copenhagen, who discovered by the accidental twitching of a compass needle near a wire that an electric current could create a magnetic field.  This landmark experiment is known as \u00d8rsted's Experiment.  Several other experiments followed, with [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]], who in 1820 discovered that the magnetic field circulating in a closed-path was related to the current flowing through the perimeter of the path; [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]; [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] and [[F\u00e9lix Savart]], both of whom in 1820 came up with the [[Biot\u2013Savart law]] giving an equation for the magnetic field from a current-carrying wire; [[Michael Faraday]], who in 1831 found that a time-varying magnetic flux through a loop of wire induced a voltage, and others finding further links between magnetism and electricity. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] synthesized and expanded these insights into [[Maxwell's equations]], unifying electricity, magnetism, and [[optics]] into the field of [[electromagnetism]]. In 1905, [[Einstein]] used these laws in motivating his theory of [[special relativity]],<ref name=\"Moving\">[http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/ A. Einstein: \"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\"], June 30, 1905.</ref> requiring that the laws held true in all [[inertial reference frame]]s.\n\nElectromagnetism has continued to develop into the 21st century, being incorporated into the more fundamental theories of [[gauge theory]], [[quantum electrodynamics]], [[electroweak theory]], and finally the [[standard model]].\n\n== Sources of magnetism ==\n{{see also|Magnetic moment}}\nMagnetism, at its root, arises from two sources:\n# [[Electric current]] (see ''[[Electron magnetic moment]]'').\n# [[Spin magnetic moment]]s of [[elementary particles]]. The magnetic moments of the nuclei of atoms are typically thousands of times smaller than the electrons' magnetic moments, so they are negligible in the context of the magnetization of materials. Nuclear magnetic moments are very important in other contexts, particularly in [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI).\n\nOrdinarily, the enormous number of electrons in a material are arranged such that their magnetic moments (both orbital and intrinsic) cancel out. This is due, to some extent, to electrons combining into pairs with opposite intrinsic magnetic moments as a result of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] (see ''[[electron configuration]]''), or combining into filled [[electron subshell|subshells]] with zero net orbital motion. In both cases, the electron arrangement is so as to exactly cancel the magnetic moments from each electron. Moreover, even when the [[electron configuration]] ''is'' such that there are unpaired electrons and/or non-filled subshells, it is often the case that the various electrons in the solid will contribute magnetic moments that point in different, random directions, so that the material will not be magnetic.\n\nHowever, sometimes\u2014either spontaneously, or owing to an applied external magnetic field\u2014each of the electron magnetic moments will be, on average, lined up. Then the material can produce a net total magnetic field, which can potentially be quite strong.\n\nThe magnetic behavior of a material depends on its structure, particularly its [[electron configuration]], for the reasons mentioned above, and also on the temperature. At high temperatures, random [[thermal motion]] makes it more difficult for the electrons to maintain alignment.\n\n== Materials ==\n[[File:Magnetism.svg|thumb|center|upright=2.7|Hierarchy of types of magnetism.<ref name=Meyers1>{{cite book |title=Introductory solid state physics |author=HP Meyers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uc1pCo5TrYUC&pg=PA322 |page=362; Figure 11.1 |isbn= 9781420075021 |year=1997 |publisher=CRC Press |edition=2}}</ref>]]\n\n=== Diamagnetism ===\n{{main article|Diamagnetism}}\nDiamagnetism appears in all materials, and is the tendency of a material to oppose an applied magnetic field, and therefore, to be repelled by a magnetic field. However, in a material with paramagnetic properties (that is, with a tendency to enhance an external magnetic field), the paramagnetic behavior dominates.<ref name=Westbrook>\n\n{{cite book |title=MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) in practice |author1=Catherine Westbrook |author2=Carolyn Kaut |author3=Carolyn Kaut-Roth |isbn=0-632-04205-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qq1SHDtS2G8C&pg=PA217 |page=217 |edition=2|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=1998}}\n\n</ref> Thus, despite its universal occurrence, diamagnetic behavior is observed only in a purely diamagnetic material. In a diamagnetic material, there are no unpaired electrons, so the intrinsic electron magnetic moments cannot produce any bulk effect. In these cases, the magnetization arises from the electrons' orbital motions, which can be understood [[classical physics|classically]] as follows:\n\n:When a material is put in a magnetic field, the electrons circling the nucleus will experience, in addition to their [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb]] attraction to the nucleus, a [[Lorentz force]] from the magnetic field. Depending on which direction the electron is orbiting, this force may increase the [[centripetal force]] on the electrons, pulling them in towards the nucleus, or it may decrease the force, pulling them away from the nucleus. This effect systematically increases the orbital magnetic moments that were aligned opposite the field, and decreases the ones aligned parallel to the field (in accordance with [[Lenz's law]]). This results in a small bulk magnetic moment, with an opposite direction to the applied field.\n\nNote that this description is meant only as a [[heuristic]]; a proper understanding requires a [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] description.\n\nNote that all materials undergo this orbital response. However, in paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances, the diamagnetic effect is overwhelmed by the much stronger effects caused by the unpaired electrons.\n\n=== Paramagnetism ===\n{{main article|Paramagnetism}}\nIn a paramagnetic material there are ''unpaired electrons'', i.e. [[atomic orbital|atomic]] or [[molecular orbital]]s with exactly one electron in them. While paired electrons are required by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] to have their intrinsic ('spin') magnetic moments pointing in opposite directions, causing their magnetic fields to cancel out, an unpaired electron is free to align its magnetic moment in any direction. When an external magnetic field is applied, these magnetic moments will tend to align themselves in the same direction as the applied field, thus reinforcing it.\n\n=== Ferromagnetism ===\n[[File:Ferromagneses penzermek 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Tip of permanent magnet with coins demonstrating ferromagnetism]]\n{{main article|Ferromagnetism}}\nA ferromagnet, like a paramagnetic substance, has unpaired electrons. However, in ''addition'' to the electrons' intrinsic magnetic moment's tendency to be parallel to an ''applied field'', there is also in these materials a tendency for these magnetic moments to orient parallel to ''each other'' to maintain a lowered-energy state. Thus, even in the absence of an applied field, the magnetic moments of the electrons in the material spontaneously line up parallel to one another.\n\nEvery ferromagnetic substance has its own individual temperature, called the [[Curie temperature]], or Curie point, above which it loses its ferromagnetic properties.  This is because the thermal tendency to disorder overwhelms the energy-lowering due to ferromagnetic order.\n\nFerromagnetism only occurs in a few substances; the common ones are [[iron]], [[nickel]], [[cobalt]], their [[alloy]]s, and some alloys of [[rare earth element|rare earth]] metals.\n\n==== Magnetic domains ====\n\n{{main article|Magnetic domains}}\n\n{{multiple image\n|total_width=400\n|width1=200|height1=200|image1=Magnetic Domains 2.svg|caption1=\n|width2=200|height2=200|image2=Magnetic Domains 3.svg|caption2=\n|footer='''Left:''' Magnetic domains boundaries (white lines) in ferromagnetic material (black rectangle). '''Right:''' Effect of a magnet on the domains.}}\n\nThe magnetic moments of atoms in a [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] material cause them to behave something like tiny permanent magnets. They stick together and align themselves into small regions of more or less uniform alignment called [[magnetic domains]] or [[Weiss domains]]. Magnetic domains can be observed with a [[magnetic force microscope]] to reveal magnetic domain boundaries that resemble white lines in the sketch. There are many scientific experiments that can physically show magnetic fields.\n\nWhen a domain contains too many molecules, it becomes unstable and divides into two domains aligned in opposite directions so that they stick together more stably as shown at the right.\n\nWhen exposed to a magnetic field, the domain boundaries move so that the domains aligned with the magnetic field grow and dominate the structure (dotted yellow area) as shown at the left.  When the magnetizing field is removed, the domains may not return to an unmagnetized state.  This results in the ferromagnetic material's being magnetized, forming a permanent magnet.\n\nWhen magnetized strongly enough that the prevailing domain overruns all others to result in only one single domain, the material is [[Saturation (magnetic)|magnetically saturated]].  When a magnetized ferromagnetic material is heated to the [[Curie point]] temperature, the molecules are agitated to the point that the magnetic domains lose the organization and the magnetic properties they cause cease.  When the material is cooled, this domain alignment structure spontaneously returns, in a manner roughly analogous to how a liquid can [[freezing|freeze]] into a crystalline solid.\n\n=== Antiferromagnetism ===\n[[Image:Antiferromagnetic ordering.svg|thumb|[[Antiferromagnetic]] ordering]]\n{{main article|Antiferromagnetism}}\nIn an antiferromagnet, unlike a ferromagnet, there is a tendency for the intrinsic magnetic moments of neighboring valence electrons to point in ''opposite'' directions. When all atoms are arranged in a substance so that each neighbor is 'anti-aligned', the substance is '''antiferromagnetic'''. Antiferromagnets have a zero net magnetic moment, meaning no field is produced by them. Antiferromagnets are less common compared to the other types of behaviors, and are mostly observed at low temperatures. In varying temperatures, antiferromagnets can be seen to exhibit diamagnetic and ferromagnetic properties.\n\nIn some materials, neighboring electrons want to point in opposite directions, but there is no geometrical arrangement in which ''each'' pair of neighbors is anti-aligned. This is called a [[spin glass]], and is an example of [[geometrical frustration]].\n\n=== Ferrimagnetism ===\n[[Image:Ferrimagnetic ordering.svg|thumb|[[Ferrimagnetic]] ordering]]\n{{main article|Ferrimagnetism}}\nLike ferromagnetism, '''ferrimagnets''' retain their magnetization in the absence of a field. However, like antiferromagnets, neighboring pairs of electron spins like to point in opposite directions. These two properties are not contradictory, because in the optimal geometrical arrangement, there is more magnetic moment from the sublattice of electrons that point in one direction, than from the sublattice that points in the opposite direction.\n\nMost [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrites]] are ferrimagnetic. The first discovered magnetic substance, [[magnetite]], is a ferrite and was originally believed to be a ferromagnet; [[Louis N\u00e9el]] disproved this, however, after discovering ferrimagnetism.\n\n===Superparamagnetism===\n{{Main article|Superparamagnetism}}\nWhen a ferromagnet or ferrimagnet is sufficiently small, it acts like a single magnetic spin that is subject to [[Brownian motion]]. Its response to a magnetic field is qualitatively similar to the response of a paramagnet, but much larger.\n\n===Other types of magnetism===\n* [[Metamagnetism]]\n* [[Molecule-based magnet]]\n* [[Spin glass]]\n\n==Electromagnet==\n[[File:Electromagnet.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|An electromagnet attracts paper clips when current is applied creating a magnetic field. The electromagnet loses them when current and magnetic field are removed.]]\n\nAn [[electromagnet]] is a type of [[magnet]] in which the [[magnetic field]] is produced by an [[electric current]]. The magnetic field disappears when the current is turned off. Electromagnets usually consist of a large number of closely spaced turns of wire that create the magnetic field.  The wire turns are often wound around a [[magnetic core]] made from a [[ferromagnetic]] or [[ferrimagnetic]] material such as [[iron]]; the magnetic core concentrates the [[magnetic flux]] and makes a more powerful magnet.\n\nThe main advantage of an electromagnet over a [[permanent magnet]] is that the magnetic field can be quickly changed by controlling the amount of electric current in the winding. However, unlike a permanent magnet that needs no power, an electromagnet requires a continuous supply of current to maintain the magnetic field.\n\nElectromagnets are widely used as components of other electrical devices, such as [[electric motor|motors]], [[Electric generator|generator]]s, [[relay]]s, [[loudspeaker]]s, [[hard disk]]s, [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI machines]], scientific instruments, and [[magnetic separation]] equipment.  Electromagnets are also employed in industry for picking up and moving heavy iron objects such as scrap iron and steel.<ref name=\"Merzouki\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Merzouki\n | first1 = Rochdi\n | last2  =  Samantaray\n | first2 = Arun Kumar\n | last3  = Pathak\n | first3 = Pushparaj Mani\n | title  = Intelligent Mechatronic Systems: Modeling, Control and Diagnosis\n | publisher = Springer Science & Business Media\n | date   = 2012\n | location = \n | pages  = 403\u2013405\n | language = \n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=k81ECeMxyk8C&pg=PA404&dq=ferromagnetic+electromagnet#v=onepage&q=ferromagnetic%20electromagnet&f=false\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 144714628X\n }}</ref> Electromagnetism was discovered in 1820.<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Sturgeon\n  | first = W.\n  | title = Improved Electro Magnetic Apparatus\n  | journal = Trans.

Both magnetism lacking electricity, and electricity without magnetism, are inconsistent with special relativity, due to such effects as [[length contraction]], [[time dilation]], and the fact that the [[magnetic force]] is velocity-dependent. However, when both electricity and magnetism are taken into account, the resulting theory ([[electromagnetism]]) is fully consistent with special relativity.<ref name=\"Moving\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|1998|loc=chapter 12}}</ref> In particular, a phenomenon that appears purely electric or purely magnetic to one observer may be a mix of both to another, or more generally the relative contributions of electricity and magnetism are dependent on the frame of reference. Thus, special relativity \"mixes\" electricity and magnetism into a single, inseparable phenomenon called [[electromagnetism]], analogous to how relativity \"mixes\" space and time into [[spacetime]].\n\nAll observations on [[electromagnetism]] apply to what might be considered to be primarily magnetism, e.g. perturbations in the magnetic field are necessarily accompanied by a nonzero electric field, and propagate at the [[speed of light]].\n\n== Magnetic fields in a material ==\n{{See also|Magnetic field#H and B inside and outside of magnetic materials}}\n\nIn a vacuum,\n:<math>\\mathbf{B} \\ = \\ \\mu_0\\mathbf{H}, </math>\nwhere {{math|&mu;<sub>0</sub>}} is the [[vacuum permeability]].\n\nIn a material, \n:<math>\\mathbf{B} \\ = \\ \\mu_0(\\mathbf{H} + \\mathbf{M}). \\ </math>\nThe quantity {{math|&mu;<sub>0</sub>'''M'''}} is called ''magnetic polarization''.\n\nIf the field {{math|'''H'''}} is small, the response of the magnetization {{math|'''M'''}} in a [[diamagnet]] or [[paramagnet]] is approximately linear:\n:<math> \\mathbf{M} = \\chi \\mathbf{H},</math>\nthe constant of proportionality being called the magnetic susceptibility.

An electric current or magnetic dipole creates a magnetic field, and that field, in turn, imparts magnetic forces on other particles that are in the fields.\n\nMaxwell's equations, which simplify to the [[Biot\u2013Savart law]] in the case of steady currents, describe the origin and behavior of the fields that govern these forces. Therefore, magnetism is seen whenever electrically [[electric charge|charged particles]] are in [[Motion (physics)|motion]]\u2014for example, from movement of electrons in an [[electric current]], or in certain cases from the orbital motion of electrons around an atom's nucleus. They also arise from \"intrinsic\" [[magnetic dipole]]s arising from quantum-mechanical [[Spin (physics)|spin]].\n\nThe same situations that create magnetic fields\u2014charge moving in a current or in an atom, and intrinsic magnetic dipoles\u2014are also the situations in which a magnetic field has an effect, creating a force. Following is the formula for moving charge; for the forces on an intrinsic dipole, see magnetic dipole.\n\nWhen a charged particle moves through a [[Magnetic field#B and H|magnetic field]] '''B''', it feels a [[Lorentz force]] '''F''' given by the [[cross product]]:<ref>{{cite book|first=John David|last=Jackson|author-link=John David Jackson (physicist)|title=Classical electrodynamics|edition=3rd|location=New York|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]]|year=1999|isbn=0-471-30932-X}}</ref>\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{F} = q (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})</math>\nwhere \n: <math>q</math> is the electric charge of the particle, and\n: '''v''' is the [[velocity]] [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] of the particle\n\nBecause this is a cross product, the force is [[perpendicular]] to both the motion of the particle and the magnetic field. It follows that the magnetic force does no [[mechanical work|work]] on the particle; it may change the direction of the particle's movement, but it cannot cause it to speed up or slow down. The magnitude of the force is\n: <math>F=qvB\\sin\\theta\\,</math>\nwhere <math>\\theta</math> is the angle between '''v''' and '''B'''.\n\nOne tool for determining the direction of the velocity vector of a moving charge, the magnetic field, and the force exerted is labeling the [[index finger]] \"V\", the [[middle finger]] \"B\", and the [[thumb]] \"F\" with your right hand. When making a gun-like configuration, with the middle finger crossing under the index finger, the fingers represent the velocity vector, magnetic field vector, and force vector, respectively. See also [[right hand rule]].\n\n== Magnetic dipoles ==\n{{main article|Magnetic dipole}}\nA very common source of magnetic field shown in nature is a [[dipole]], with a \"[[South pole]]\" and a \"[[North pole]]\", terms dating back to the use of magnets as compasses, interacting with the [[Earth's magnetic field]] to indicate North and South on the [[globe]]. Since opposite ends of magnets are attracted, the north pole of a magnet is attracted to the south pole of another magnet.  The Earth's [[North Magnetic Pole]] (currently in the Arctic Ocean, north of Canada) is physically a south pole, as it attracts the north pole of a compass.\nA magnetic field contains [[energy]], and physical systems move toward configurations with lower energy. When diamagnetic material is placed in a magnetic field, a ''magnetic dipole'' tends to align itself in opposed polarity to that field, thereby lowering the net field strength. When ferromagnetic material is placed within a magnetic field, the magnetic dipoles align to the applied field, thus expanding the domain walls of the magnetic domains.\n\n=== Magnetic monopoles ===\n{{main article|Magnetic monopole}}\nSince a bar magnet gets its ferromagnetism from electrons distributed evenly throughout the bar, when a bar magnet is cut in half, each of the resulting pieces is a smaller bar magnet. Even though a magnet is said to have a north pole and a south pole, these two poles cannot be separated from each other. A monopole\u2014if such a thing exists\u2014would be a new and fundamentally different kind of magnetic object. It would act as an isolated north pole, not attached to a south pole, or vice versa. Monopoles would carry \"magnetic charge\" analogous to electric charge. Despite systematic searches since 1931, {{As of|2010|lc=on}}, they have never been observed, and could very well not exist.<ref>Milton mentions some inconclusive events (p.60) and still concludes that \"no evidence at all of magnetic monopoles has survived\" (p.3). {{cite journal|last=Milton|first=Kimball A.|title=Theoretical and experimental status of magnetic monopoles|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|volume=69|issue=6|date=June 2006|pages=1637\u20131711|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/69/6/R02|arxiv=hep-ex/0602040|bibcode = 2006RPPh...69.1637M}}.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, some [[theoretical physics]] models predict the existence of these [[magnetic monopoles]]. [[Paul Dirac]] observed in 1931 that, because electricity and magnetism show a certain [[symmetry]], just as [[Quantum electrodynamics|quantum theory]] predicts that individual [[positive charge|positive]] or [[negative charge|negative]] electric charges can be observed without the opposing charge, isolated South or North magnetic poles should be observable. Using quantum theory Dirac showed that if magnetic monopoles exist, then one could explain the quantization of electric charge\u2014that is, why the observed [[elementary particles]] carry charges that are multiples of the charge of the electron.\n\nCertain [[grand unified theories]] predict the existence of monopoles which, unlike elementary particles, are [[solitons]] (localized energy packets). The initial results of using these models to estimate the number of monopoles created in the [[big bang]] contradicted cosmological observations\u2014the monopoles would have been so plentiful and massive that they would have long since halted the expansion of the universe. However, the idea of [[Cosmic inflation|inflation]] (for which this problem served as a partial motivation) was successful in solving this problem, creating models in which monopoles existed but were rare enough to be consistent with current observations.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Guth|authorlink=Alan Guth|title=The Inflationary Universe: The Quest for a New Theory of Cosmic Origins|isbn=0-201-32840-2|publisher=Perseus|year=1997|oclc=38941224}}.</ref>\n\n== Quantum-mechanical origin of magnetism ==\nIn principle all kinds of magnetism originate (similar to [[superconductivity]]){{clarify|date=December 2014}} from specific quantum-mechanical phenomena (e.g. [[Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], in particular the chapters on [[spin (physics)|spin]] and on the [[Pauli principle]]).\nA successful model was developed already in  1927, by [[Walter Heitler]] and [[Fritz London]], who derived quantum-mechanically, how hydrogen molecules are formed from hydrogen atoms, i.e. from the atomic hydrogen orbitals <math> u_A</math> and <math>u_B</math> centered at the nuclei ''A'' and ''B'', see below. That this leads to magnetism is not at all obvious, but will be explained in the following.\n\nAccording to the Heitler-London theory, so-called two-body molecular <math>\\sigma</math>-orbitals are formed, namely the resulting orbital is:\n\n:<math>\\psi(\\mathbf r_1,\\,\\,\\mathbf r_2)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\,\\,\\left (u_A(\\mathbf r_1)u_B(\\mathbf r_2)+u_B(\\mathbf r_1)u_A(\\mathbf r_2)\\right )</math>\n\nHere the last product means that a first electron, '''r'''<sub>1</sub>, is in an atomic hydrogen-orbital centered at the second nucleus, whereas the second electron runs around the first nucleus. This \"exchange\" phenomenon is an expression for the quantum-mechanical property that particles with identical properties  cannot be distinguished. It is specific not only for the formation of [[chemical bond]]s, but as we will see, also for magnetism, i.e. in this connection the term [[exchange interaction]] arises, a term which is essential for the origin of magnetism, and which is stronger, roughly by factors 100 and even by 1000, than the energies arising from the electrodynamic dipole-dipole interaction.\n\nAs for the ''spin function'' <math>\\chi (s_1,s_2)</math>, which is responsible for the magnetism, we have the already mentioned Pauli's principle, namely that a symmetric orbital (i.e. with the + sign as above) must be multiplied with an antisymmetric spin function (i.e. with a \u2212 sign), and ''vice versa''. Thus:\n:<math>\\chi (s_1,\\,\\,s_2)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\,\\,\\left (\\alpha (s_1)\\beta (s_2)-\\beta (s_1)\\alpha (s_2)\\right )</math>,\n\nI.e., not only   <math>u_A</math> and <math>u_B</math> must be substituted by ''\u03b1'' and ''\u03b2'', respectively  (the first entity means \"spin up\", the second one \"spin down\"), but also the sign + by the \u2212 sign, and finally '''r'''<sub>i</sub> by the discrete values ''s''<sub>i</sub> (=&nbsp;\u00b1\u00bd); thereby we have <math>\\alpha(+1/2)=\\beta(-1/2)=1</math> and <math>\\alpha(-1/2)=\\beta(+1/2)=0</math>. The \"[[singlet state]]\", i.e. the \u2212 sign, means: the spins are  ''antiparallel'', i.e. for the solid we have  [[antiferromagnetism]], and for two-atomic molecules one has [[diamagnetism]]. The tendency to form a (homoeopolar) chemical bond (this means: the formation of a ''symmetric'' molecular orbital, i.e. with the + sign) results  through the Pauli principle automatically in an ''antisymmetric'' spin state (i.e. with the \u2212 sign). In contrast, the Coulomb repulsion of the electrons, i.e. the tendency  that they try to avoid each other by this repulsion, would lead to an ''antisymmetric'' orbital function (i.e. with the \u2212 sign) of these two particles, and complementary to a ''symmetric'' spin function (i.e. with the + sign, one of the so-called \"[[triplet state|triplet functions]]\"). Thus, now the spins would be ''parallel'' ([[ferromagnetism]] in a solid, [[paramagnetism]] in two-atomic gases).\n\nThe last-mentioned tendency dominates in the metals [[iron]], [[cobalt]] and [[nickel]], and in some rare earths, which are ''ferromagnetic''. Most of the other metals, where the first-mentioned tendency dominates, are ''nonmagnetic'' (e.g. [[sodium]], [[aluminium]], and [[magnesium]]) or ''antiferromagnetic'' (e.g. [[manganese]]). Diatomic gases are also almost exclusively diamagnetic, and not paramagnetic. However, the oxygen molecule, because of the involvement of \u03c0-orbitals, is an exception important for the life-sciences.\n\nThe Heitler-London considerations can be generalized to the [[Heisenberg model (classical)|Heisenberg model]] of magnetism (Heisenberg 1928).\n\nThe explanation of the phenomena is thus essentially based on all subtleties of quantum mechanics, whereas the electrodynamics covers mainly  the phenomenology.\n\n== Units ==\n\n=== SI ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"5\"|[[SI]] electromagnetism units\n|-\n!Symbol<ref>{{GreenBookRef2nd|pages=14\u201315}}</ref>\n!Name of quantity\n!Derived units\n!Conversion of international to [[SI base unit]]s\n|-\n|\n:''I''\n|[[Electric current]]\n|[[ampere]] ([[SI base unit]])\n|<math>\\mathrm{A=C\\ s^{-1}}</math>\n|-\n|\n:''q''\n|[[Electric charge]]\n|[[coulomb]]\n|<math>\\mathrm{C=A\\ s}</math> \n|-\n|<math>U,\\ \\Delta V,\\ \\Delta\\phi,\\ \\Epsilon</math>\n|[[Potential difference]]; [[Electromotive force]]\n|[[volt]]\n|<math>\\mathrm{V=J\\ C^{-1}=kg\\ A^{-1}m^2s^{-3}}</math>\n|-\n|<math>R;\\ \\Zeta;\\ \\Chi</math>\n|[[Electric resistance|Resistance]]; [[Electrical impedance|Impedance]]; [[Reactance (electronics)|Reactance]]\n|[[Ohm (unit)|ohm]]\n|<math>\\mathrm{\\Omega=V\\ A^{-1}=kg\\ m^{2} \\ A^{-2}s^{-3}}</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\ \\rho</math>\n|[[Resistivity]]\n|[[Ohm (unit)|ohm]] [[metre]]\n|<math>\\mathrm{\\Omega\\ m=kg\\ A^{-2}m^3s^{-3}}</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\ \\Rho</math>\n|[[Electric power]]\n|[[watt]]\n|<math>\\mathrm{W=V\\ A=kg\\ m^2s^{-3}}</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\ C</math>\n|[[Capacitance]]\n|[[farad]]\n|<math>\\mathrm{F=C\\ V^{-1}=A^2kg^{-1}m^{-2}s^4}</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\mathbf{\\Epsilon}</math>\n|[[Electric field]] strength\n|[[volt]] per [[metre]]\n|<math>\\mathrm{V\\ m^{-1}=C^{-1}N=kg\\ A^{-1}m\\ s^{-3}}</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\mathbf{D}</math>\n|[[Electric displacement field]]\n|[[Coulomb]] per [[square metre]]\n|<math>\\mathrm{C\\ m^{-2}=A\\ m^{-2}s}</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\varepsilon</math>\n|[[Permittivity]]\n|[[farad]] per [[metre]]\n|<math>\\mathrm{F\\ m^{-1}=A^{2}kg^{-1}m^{-3}s^{4}}</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\!\\chi_e</math>\n|[[Electric susceptibility]]\n|[[Dimensionless quantity|Dimensionless]]\n|\n|-\n|<math>G;\\ \\Upsilon;\\ \\Beta</math>\n|[[Electrical conductance|Conductance]]; [[Admittance]]; [[Susceptance]]\n|[[Siemens (unit)|siemens]]\n|<math>\\ \\mathrm{S=\\Omega^{-1}=kg^{-1}A^2m^{-2}s^3}</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\gamma,\\ \\kappa,\\ \\sigma</math>\n|[[Electrical conductivity|Conductivity]]\n|[[siemens (unit)|siemens]] per [[metre]]\n|<math>\\mathrm{S\\ m^{-1}=A^2kg^{-1}m^{-3}s^3}</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\ \\mathbf{B}</math>\n|[[Magnetic field|Magnetic flux density, Magnetic induction]]\n|[[tesla (unit)|tesla]]\n|<math>\\mathrm{T=Wb\\ m^{-2}=kg\\ A^{-1}s^{-2}}</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\ \\Phi</math>\n|[[Magnetic flux]]\n|[[weber (unit)|weber]]\n|<math>\\mathrm{Wb=V\\ s=kg\\ A^{-1}m^2s^{-2}}</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\mathbf{H}</math>\n|[[Magnetic field]] strength\n|[[ampere]] per [[metre]]\n|<math>\\mathrm{A\\ m^{-1}}</math>\n|-\n|<math>L,\\ \\Mu</math>\n|[[Inductance]]\n|[[henry (unit)|henry]]\n|<math>\\mathrm{H=Wb\\ A^{-1}=V\\ A^{-1}s=kg\\ A^{-2}m^2s^{-2}}</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\ \\mu</math>\n|[[Permeability (electromagnetism)|Permeability]]\n|[[henry (unit)|henry]] per [[metre]]\n|<math>\\mathrm{H m^{-1}=kg\\ A^{-2}m\\ s^{-2}}</math>\n|-\n|<math>\\ \\chi</math>\n|[[Magnetic susceptibility]]\n|[[Dimensionless quantity|Dimensionless]]\n|\n|}\n\n=== Other ===\n* [[gauss (unit)|gauss]] \u2013 the [[centimeter-gram-second]] (CGS) [[units of measurement|unit]] of magnetic field (denoted '''B''')\n* [[oersted]] \u2013 the CGS unit of [[Magnetic field#B and H|magnetizing field]] (denoted '''H''')\n* [[maxwell (unit)|maxwell]] \u2013 the CGS unit for [[magnetic flux]]\n* gamma \u2013 a unit of ''magnetic flux density'' that was commonly used before the [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] came into use (1.0 gamma = 1.0 nanotesla)\n* ''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub> \u2013 common symbol for the [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of free space (4\u03c0\u00d710<sup>\u22127</sup> [[newton (unit)|newton]]/([[ampere-turn]])<sup>2</sup>)\n\n== Living things ==\nSome [[organisms]] can detect magnetic fields, a phenomenon known as [[magnetoception]].
