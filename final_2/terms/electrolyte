The dissolved electrolyte separates into [[cation]]s and [[anion]]s, which disperse uniformly through the solvent. Electrically, such a solution is neutral. If an [[electric potential]] (not [[voltage]] in wire) is applied to such a solution, the cations of the solution are drawn to the electrode that has an abundance of electrons, while the anions are drawn to the electrode that has a deficit of electrons. The movement of anions and cations in opposite directions within the solution amounts to a current. This includes most soluble [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]], [[acid]]s, and [[Base (chemistry)|bases]]. Some gases, such as [[hydrogen chloride]], under conditions of high temperature or low pressure can also function as electrolytes. Electrolyte solutions can also result from the dissolution of some biological (e.g., [[DNA]], [[polypeptides]]) and [[synthetic polymer]]s (e.g., [[polystyrene sulfonate]]), termed \"[[polyelectrolyte]]s\", which contain charged [[functional group]]s. A substance that dissociates into ions in solution acquires the capacity to conduct electricity. Sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are examples of electrolytes, informally known as \"lytes\".\n\nIn medicine, [[oral rehydration therapy|electrolyte replacement]] is needed when a patient has prolonged vomiting or diarrhea, and as a response to strenuous athletic activity. Commercial electrolyte solutions are available, particularly for sick children (oral rehydration solutions) and athletes ([[sports drink]]s). Electrolyte monitoring is important in the treatment of [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]] and [[bulimia]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''electrolyte'' derives from the Greek ''lyt\u00f3s'', meaning \"able to be untied or loosened\".\n\n==History==\n[[Svante Arrhenius]] put forth, in his 1884 dissertation, his explanation of the fact that solid crystalline salts disassociate into paired charged particles when dissolved, for which he won the 1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.<ref>http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1903/index.html</ref><ref name=\"columbia\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Harris|editor1-first=William|editor2-last=Levey|editor2-first=Judith|title=The New Columbia Encyclopedia|date=1975|publisher=Columbia University|location=New York City|isbn=0-231035-721|page=155|edition=4th}}</ref><ref  name=\"EncBrit\">{{cite book|editor1-last=McHenry|editor1-first=Charles|title=The New Encyclopedia Britannica|date=1992|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc.|location=Chicago|isbn=085-229553-7|page=587|volume=1|edition=15}}</ref><ref name=\"SciBio\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Cillispie|editor1-first=Charles|title=Dictionary of Scientific Biography|date=1970|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York City|isbn=0-684101-122|pages=296\u2013302|edition=1}}</ref>\n\nArrhenius's explanation was that in forming a solution, the salt dissociates into charged particles, to which [[Michael Faraday]] had given the name \"[[ion]]s\" many years earlier. Faraday's belief had been that ions were produced in the process of [[electrolysis]]. Arrhenius proposed that, even in the absence of an electric current, solutions of salts contained ions. He thus proposed that chemical reactions in solution were reactions between ions.<ref name=\"columbia\"/><ref name=\"EncBrit\"/><ref name=\"SciBio\"/>\n\n==Formation==\nElectrolyte solutions are normally formed when a salt is placed into a [[solvent]] such as water and the individual components dissociate due to the [[thermodynamic]] interactions between solvent and solute molecules, in a process called \"[[solvation]]\". For example, when table salt ([[sodium chloride]]), NaCl, is placed in water, the salt (a solid) dissolves into its component ions, according to the dissociation reaction\n:NaCl<sub>(s)</sub> \u2192 Na<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + Cl<sup>\u2212</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>\nIt is also possible for substances to react with water, producing ions.  For example, [[carbon dioxide]] gas dissolves in water to produce a solution that contains [[hydronium]], [[carbonate]], and [[Carbonic Acid|hydrogen carbonate]] ions.\n\nMolten salts can also be electrolytes as, for example, when sodium chloride is molten, the liquid conducts electricity. In particular, ionic liquids, which are molten salts with melting points below 100&nbsp;\u00b0C, are a type of highly conductive non-aqueous electrolytes and thus have found more and more applications in fuel cells and batteries.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author1=Jiangshui Luo |author2=Jin Hu |author3=Wolfgang Saak |author4=R\u00fcdiger Beckhaus |author5=Gunther Wittstock |author6=Ivo F.

If a high proportion of the solute dissociates to form free ions, the electrolyte is strong; if most of the solute does not dissociate, the electrolyte is weak. The properties of electrolytes may be exploited using electrolysis to extract constituent elements and compounds contained within the solution.\n\n==Physiological importance==\n{{See also|Water\u2013electrolyte imbalance}}\n\nIn [[physiology]], the primary ions of electrolytes are [[sodium]] (Na<sup>+</sup>), [[potassium]] (K<sup>+</sup>), [[calcium]] (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), [[magnesium]] (Mg<sup>2+</sup>), [[chloride]] (Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>), [[hydrogen phosphate]] (HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>), and [[hydrogen carbonate]] (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>). The electric charge symbols of plus (+) and minus (\u2212)  indicate that the substance is ionic in nature and has an imbalanced distribution of electrons, the result of [[Dissociation (chemistry)|chemical dissociation]]. Sodium is the main electrolyte found in extracellular fluid and potassium is the main intracellular electrolyte; both are involved in fluid balance and blood pressure control.\n\nAll known higher lifeforms require a subtle and complex electrolyte balance between the [[intracellular]] and [[extracellular]] environments. In particular, the maintenance of precise [[osmotic]] [[ion gradient|gradient]]s of electrolytes is important. Such gradients affect and regulate the [[Rehydration|hydration]] of the body as well as [[Acid\u2013base homeostasis|blood pH]], and are critical for [[nerve]] and [[muscle]] function. Various mechanisms exist in living species that keep the concentrations of different electrolytes under tight control.\n\nBoth muscle tissue and neurons are considered electric tissues of the body. Muscles and neurons are activated by electrolyte activity between the [[extracellular fluid]] or [[interstitial fluid]], and [[intracellular fluid]]. Electrolytes may enter or leave the cell membrane through specialized protein structures embedded in the [[plasma membrane]] called \"[[ion channels]]\". For example, [[muscle contraction]] is dependent upon the presence of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>), and potassium (K<sup>+</sup>). Without sufficient levels of these key electrolytes, muscle weakness or severe muscle contractions may occur.\n\nElectrolyte balance is maintained by oral, or in emergencies, intravenous (IV) intake of electrolyte-containing substances, and is regulated by [[hormone]]s, in general with the [[kidney]]s flushing out excess levels. In humans, electrolyte [[homeostasis]] is regulated by hormones such as [[antidiuretic hormone]]s, [[aldosterone]] and [[parathyroid hormone]]s. Serious [[electrolyte disturbance]]s, such as [[dehydration]] and [[Water intoxication|overhydration]], may lead to cardiac and neurological complications and, unless they are rapidly resolved, will result in a [[medical emergency]].\n\n===Measurement===\nMeasurement of electrolytes is a commonly performed diagnostic procedure, performed via [[blood test]]ing  with [[ion-selective electrode]]s or [[urinalysis]] by [[medical technologist]]s. The interpretation of these values is somewhat meaningless without analysis of the [[medical history|clinical history]] and is often impossible without parallel measurements of [[renal function]]. The electrolytes measured most often are sodium and potassium. Chloride levels are rarely measured except for [[arterial blood gas]] interpretations, since they are inherently linked to sodium levels. One important test conducted on urine is the [[specific gravity]] test to determine the occurrence of an [[electrolyte imbalance]].\n\n===Rehydration===\nIn [[oral rehydration therapy]], electrolyte drinks containing sodium and potassium salts replenish the body's water and electrolyte concentrations after dehydration caused by [[exercise]], [[Alcohol abuse|excessive alcohol consumption]], [[diaphoresis]] (heavy sweating), diarrhea, vomiting, [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] or starvation. Athletes exercising in extreme conditions (for three or more hours continuously, e.g. a [[marathon]] or [[triathlon]]) who do not consume electrolytes risk dehydration (or [[hyponatremia]]).<ref>{{cite journal |author1=J, Estevez E |author2=Baquero E |author3=Mora-Rodriguez R |title=Anaerobic performance when rehydrating with water or commercially available sports drinks during prolonged exercise in the heat |journal=Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism |volume=33 |pages=290\u2013298 |year=2008 |doi=10.1139/H07-188 |pmid=18347684 |issue=2}}</ref>\n\nA home-made electrolyte drink can be made by using water, sugar and salt in precise proportions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/hw/health_guide_atoz/str2254.asp?navbar=hw86827 |title=Rehydration drinks |publisher=Webmd.com |date=2008-04-28 |accessdate=2010-08-20}}</ref> Pre-made preparations are also available commercially,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rehydrate.org/resources/suppliers.htm |title=Oral Rehydration Salt Suppliers|publisher= Rehydrate.org |date=2014-10-07 |accessdate=2014-12-04}}</ref> and also for veterinary use.\n\nElectrolytes are commonly found in fruit juices, sports drinks, milk, nuts, and many fruits and vegetables (whole or in juice form) (e.g., potatoes, avocados).\n\n==Electrochemistry==\n{{Main article|electrolysis}}\n\nWhen [[electrode]]s are placed in an electrolyte and a [[voltage]] is applied, the electrolyte will conduct electricity. Lone [[electron]]s normally cannot pass through the electrolyte; instead, a chemical reaction occurs at the [[cathode]], providing electrons to the electrolyte.   Another reaction occurs at the [[anode]], consuming electrons from the electrolyte. As a result, a negative charge cloud develops in the electrolyte around the cathode, and a positive charge develops around the anode. The ions in the electrolyte neutralize these charges, enabling the electrons to keep flowing and the reactions to continue.\n\nFor example, in a solution of ordinary table salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) in water, the cathode reaction will be\n:2H<sub>2</sub>O + 2e<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 2OH<sup>\u2212</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>\nand [[hydrogen]] gas will bubble up; the anode reaction is\n:2NaCl \u2192 2 Na<sup>+</sup> + Cl<sub>2</sub> + 2e<sup>\u2212</sup>\nand [[chlorine]] gas will be liberated. The positively charged sodium ions Na<sup>+</sup> will react toward the cathode, neutralizing the negative charge of OH<sup>\u2212</sup> there, and the negatively charged hydroxide ions OH<sup>\u2212</sup> will react toward the anode, neutralizing the positive charge of Na<sup>+</sup> there. Without the ions from the electrolyte, the charges around the electrode would slow down continued electron flow; [[diffusion]] of H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>\u2212</sup> through water to the other electrode takes longer than movement of the much more prevalent salt ions.\nElectrolytes dissociate in water because water molecules are dipoles and the dipoles orient in an energetically favorable manner to solvate the ions.\n\nIn other systems, the electrode reactions can involve the metals of the electrodes as well as the ions of the electrolyte.\n\nElectrolytic conductors are used in electronic devices where the chemical reaction at a metal-electrolyte interface yields useful effects.\n* In [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], two materials with different electron affinities are used as electrodes; electrons flow from one electrode to the other outside of the battery, while inside the battery the circuit is closed by the electrolyte's ions. Here, the electrode reactions convert chemical energy to electrical energy.<ref name=\"Kamil Perzyna, Regina Borkowska, Jaroslaw Syzdek, Aldona Zalewska, Wladyslaw Wieczorek 2011 58\u201365\">{{cite journal|author1=Kamil Perzyna |author2=Regina Borkowska |author3=Jaroslaw Syzdek |author4=Aldona Zalewska |author5=Wladyslaw Wieczorek |title=The effect of additive of Lewis acid type on lithium\u2013gel electrolyte characteristics|journal=Electrochimica Acta| volume=57|pages=58\u201365|year=2011|doi=10.1016/j.electacta.2011.06.014}}</ref>\n* In some [[fuel cell]]s, a solid electrolyte or [[proton conductor]] connects the plates electrically while keeping the hydrogen and oxygen fuel gases separated.<ref name=\"1,2,4-Triazolium perfluorobutanesulfonate as an archetypal pure protic organic ionic plastic crystal electrolyte for all-solid-state fuel cells\"/>\n* In [[electroplating]] tanks, the electrolyte simultaneously deposits metal onto the object to be plated, and electrically connects that object in the circuit.\n* In operation-hours gauges, two thin columns of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] are separated by a small electrolyte-filled gap, and, as charge is passed through the device, the metal dissolves on one side and plates out on the other, causing the visible gap to slowly move along.\n* In [[electrolytic capacitor]]s the chemical effect is used to produce an extremely thin [[dielectric]] or [[Electrical insulation|insulating]] coating, while the electrolyte layer behaves as one capacitor plate.\n* In some [[hygrometer]]s the humidity of air is sensed by measuring the conductivity of a nearly dry electrolyte.\n* Hot, softened glass is an electrolytic conductor, and some glass manufacturers keep the glass molten by passing a large current through it.\n\n==Solid electrolytes==\n{{underlinked|section|date=October 2015}}\nSolid electrolytes can be mostly divided into four groups:\n* Gel electrolytes - closely resemble liquid electrolytes. In essence, they are liquids in a flexible lattice framework.

Usually it is a relatively high dielectric constant polymer (PEO, PMMA, PAN, polyphosphazenes, siloxanes, etc.) and a salt with low lattice energy. In order to increase the mechanical strength and conductivity of such electrolytes, very often composites are used, and inert ceramic phase is introduced. There are two major classes of such electrolytes: polymer-in-ceramic, and ceramic-in-polymer.<ref name=\"SyzdekBorkowska2007\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Syzdek J,Borkowska R,Perzyna K, Tarascon JM, Wieczorek W|title=Novel composite polymeric electrolytes with surface-modified inorganic fillers|journal=Journal of Power Sources|volume=173|issue=2|year=2007|pages=712\u2013720|issn=0378-7753|doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2007.05.061}}</ref><ref name=\"SyzdekArmand2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Syzdek J, Armand M, Marcinek M, Zalewska A, \u017bukowska G, Wieczorek W|title=Detailed studies on the fillers modification and their influence on composite, poly(oxyethylene)-based polymeric electrolytes|journal=Electrochimica Acta|volume=55|issue=4|year=2010|pages=1314\u20131322|issn=0013-4686|doi=10.1016/j.electacta.2009.04.025}}</ref><ref name=\"SyzdekArmand2009\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Syzdek J, Armand M, Gizowska M, Marcinek M,Sasim E, Szafran M, Wieczorek W|title=Ceramic-in-polymer versus polymer-in-ceramic polymeric electrolytes\u2014A novel approach|journal=Journal of Power Sources|volume=194|issue=1|year=2009|pages=66\u201372|issn=0378-7753|doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.01.070}}</ref>\n* Solid ceramic electrolytes - ions migrate through the ceramic phase by means of vacancies or interstitials within the lattice.
