However, temperature has a more complicated profile with altitude, and may remain relatively constant or even increase with altitude in some regions (see the [[Atmosphere of Earth#Temperature and speed of sound|temperature]] section, below). Because the general pattern of the temperature/altitude profile is constant and measurable by means of instrumented [[Weather balloon|balloon soundings]], the temperature behavior provides a useful metric to distinguish atmospheric layers. In this way, Earth's atmosphere can be divided (called atmospheric stratification) into five main layers. Excluding the exosphere, Earth has four primary layers, which are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.<ref>http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/science/mos-upper-atmosphere.html#.VHg5AzHF8vY</ref> From highest to lowest, the five main layers are:\n* Exosphere: 700 to 10,000&nbsp;km (440 to 6,200 miles)\n* Thermosphere: 80 to 700&nbsp;km (50 to 440 miles)<ref name=\"thermosphere\">{{cite web |author=Randy Russell |title= The Thermosphere |year=2008 |url= http://www.windows2universe.org/earth/Atmosphere/thermosphere.html|accessdate=2013-10-18}}</ref>\n* Mesosphere: 50 to 80&nbsp;km (31 to 50 miles)\n* Stratosphere: 12 to 50&nbsp;km (7 to 31 miles)\n* Troposphere: 0 to 12&nbsp;km (0 to 7 miles)<ref name=tropopauseheight>{{cite web|url=http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap01/tropo.html|title=The height of the tropopause|publisher=Das.uwyo.edu|date=|accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref>\n\n{{plain image|File:Earth's atmosphere.svg|'''Earth's atmosphere''' Lower 4 layers of the atmosphere in 3 dimensions as seen diagonally from above the exobase.  Layers drawn to scale, objects within the layers are not to scale. Aurorae shown here at the bottom of the thermosphere can actually form at any altitude in this atmospheric layer|420px|right|top|triangle|#224975}}\n\n====Exosphere====\n{{main|Exosphere}}\nThe exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere (i.e. the upper limit of the atmosphere). It extends from the [[exobase]], which is located at the top of the thermosphere at an altitude of about 700&nbsp;km above sea level, to about 10,000&nbsp;km (6,200&nbsp;mi; 33,000,000&nbsp;ft) where it merges into the [[solar wind]].\n\nThis layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen, helium and several heavier molecules including nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide closer to the exobase. The atoms and molecules are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with one another. Thus, the exosphere no longer behaves like a gas, and the particles constantly escape into space. These free-moving particles follow [[ballistic trajectories]] and may migrate in and out of the [[magnetosphere]] or the [[solar wind]].\n\nThe exosphere is located too far above Earth for any meteorological phenomena to be possible. However, the [[aurora borealis]] and [[aurora australis]] sometimes occur in the lower part of the exosphere, where they overlap into the thermosphere. The exosphere contains most of the satellites orbiting Earth.\n\n====Thermosphere====\n{{main|Thermosphere}}\nThe thermosphere is the second-highest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from the mesopause (which separates it from the mesosphere) at an altitude of about {{convert|80|km|mi ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} up to the [[thermopause]] at an altitude range of {{convert|500|-|1000|km|mi ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2|comma=5}}. The height of the thermopause varies considerably due to changes in solar activity.<ref name=\"thermosphere\"/> Because the thermopause lies at the lower boundary of the exosphere, it is also referred to as the [[exobase]]. The lower part of the thermosphere, from {{convert|80|to|550|km}} above Earth's surface, contains the [[ionosphere]].\n\nThe temperature of the thermosphere gradually increases with height. Unlike the stratosphere beneath it, wherein a temperature [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion]] is due to the absorption of radiation by ozone, the inversion in the thermosphere occurs due to the extremely low density of its molecules. The temperature of this layer can rise as high as {{convert|1500|C|abbr=on|sigfig=2|comma=5}}, though the gas molecules are so far apart that its [[Kinetic theory of gases|temperature in the usual sense]] is not very meaningful. The air is so rarefied that an individual molecule (of [[oxygen]], for example) travels an average of {{convert|1|km|mi ft|comma=5}} between collisions with other molecules.<ref>Ahrens, C. Donald. Essentials of Meteorology. Published by Thomson Brooks/Cole, 2005.</ref> Although the thermosphere has a high proportion of molecules with high energy, it would not feel hot to a human in direct contact, because its density is too low to conduct a significant amount of energy to or from the skin.\n\nThis layer is completely cloudless and free of water vapor. However non-hydrometeorological phenomena such as the [[aurora borealis]] and [[aurora australis]] are occasionally seen in the thermosphere. The [[International Space Station]] orbits in this layer, between {{convert|350|and|420|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.\n\n====Mesosphere====\n{{main|Mesosphere}}\nThe mesosphere is the third highest layer of Earth's atmosphere, occupying the region above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere. It extends from the stratopause at an altitude of about {{convert|50|km|mi ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} to the mesopause at {{convert|80|-|85|km|mi ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} above sea level.\n\nTemperatures drop with increasing altitude to the [[mesopause]] that marks the top of this middle layer of the atmosphere. It is the coldest place on Earth and has an average temperature around {{convert|-85|C|F K|abbr=on|lk=on|sigfig=2}}.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=States|first=Robert J.|last2=Gardner|first2=Chester S.|title=Thermal Structure of the Mesopause Region (80\u2013105 km) at 40\u00b0N Latitude.

These are the highest clouds in the atmosphere and may be visible to the naked eye if sunlight reflects off them about an hour or two after sunset or a similar length of time before sunrise. They are most readily visible when the Sun is around 4 to 16 degrees below the horizon. A type of lightning referred to as either [[Sprite (lightning)|sprites]] or [[ELVES]] occasionally forms far above tropospheric thunderclouds. The mesosphere is also the layer where most [[meteor]]s burn up upon atmospheric entrance. It is too high above Earth to be accessible to jet-powered aircraft and balloons, and too low to permit orbital spacecraft. The mesosphere is mainly accessed by [[sounding rocket]]s and rocket-powered aircraft.\n\n====Stratosphere====\n{{main|Stratosphere}}\n\nThe stratosphere is the second-lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It lies above the troposphere and is separated from it by the [[tropopause]]. This layer extends from the top of the troposphere at roughly {{convert|12|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} above Earth's surface to the [[stratopause]] at an altitude of about {{convert|50|to|55|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe atmospheric pressure at the top of the stratosphere is roughly 1/1000 the pressure at [[Sea level pressure|sea level]]. It contains the ozone layer, which is the part of Earth's atmosphere that contains relatively high concentrations of that gas. The stratosphere defines a layer in which temperatures rise with increasing altitude. This rise in temperature is caused by the absorption of [[ultraviolet radiation]] (UV) radiation from the Sun by the [[ozone layer]], which restricts turbulence and mixing. Although the temperature may be {{convert|-60|C|F K|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} at the tropopause, the top of the stratosphere is much warmer, and may be near 0&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=\"stratopause\">{{cite web |author=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |title=stratopause |year=1993 |url= http://www.webref.org/chemistry/s/stratopause.htm|accessdate=2013-10-18}}</ref>\n\nThe stratospheric temperature profile creates very stable atmospheric conditions, so the stratosphere lacks the weather-producing air turbulence that is so prevalent in the troposphere. Consequently, the stratosphere is almost completely free of clouds and other forms of weather. However, polar stratospheric or [[nacreous cloud]]s are occasionally seen in the lower part of this layer of the atmosphere where the air is coldest. The stratosphere is the highest layer that can be accessed by jet-powered aircraft.\n\n====Troposphere====\n{{main|Troposphere}}\nThe troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from Earth's surface to an average height of about 12&nbsp;km, although this altitude actually varies from about {{convert|9|km|ft|abbr=on}} at the poles to {{convert|17|km|ft|abbr=on}} at the [[equator]],<ref name=tropopauseheight/> with some variation due to [[weather]]. The troposphere is bounded above by the [[tropopause]], a boundary marked in most places by a temperature inversion (i.e. a layer of relatively warm air above a colder one), and in others by a zone which is isothermal with height.<ref>Barry, R.G. & Chorley R.J. (1971). ''Atmosphere, Weather and Climate''. ''London, Menthuen & Co Ltd.'', p. 65</ref><ref>Tyson, P.D., Preston-Whyte, R.A. (2013). ''The Weather and Climate of Southern Africa.'' (Second Edition). ''Oxford, Oxford University Press.''  p. 4.</ref>\n\nAlthough variations do occur, the temperature usually declines with increasing altitude in the troposphere because the troposphere is mostly heated through energy transfer from the surface. Thus, the lowest part of the troposphere (i.e. Earth's surface) is typically the warmest section of the troposphere. This promotes vertical mixing (hence the origin of its name in the Greek word \u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2, ''tropos'', meaning \"turn\"). The troposphere contains roughly 80% of the [[mass]] of Earth's atmosphere.<ref>McGraw-Hill Concise Encyclopedia of Science & Technology. (1984). Troposphere. \"It contains about four-fifths of the mass of the whole atmosphere.\"</ref> The troposphere is denser than all its overlying atmospheric layers because a larger atmospheric weight sits on top of the troposphere and causes it to be most severely compressed. Fifty percent of the total mass of the atmosphere is located in the lower 5.6&nbsp;km (18,000&nbsp;ft) of the troposphere.\n\nNearly all atmospheric water vapor or moisture is found in the troposphere, so it is the layer where most of Earth's weather takes place. It has basically all the weather-associated [[cloud]] genus types generated by active wind circulation, although very tall cumulonimbus thunder clouds can penetrate the tropopause from below and rise into the lower part of the stratosphere. Most conventional aviation activity takes place in the troposphere, and it is the only layer that can be accessed by propeller-driven aircraft.\n\n[[File:Endeavour silhouette STS-130.jpg|thumb|[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'']] orbiting in the thermosphere. Because of the angle of the photo, it appears to straddle the stratosphere and mesosphere that actually lie more than 250&nbsp;km below. The orange layer is the [[troposphere]], which gives way to the whitish [[stratosphere]] and then the blue [[mesosphere]].<ref>{{cite web|title=ISS022-E-062672 caption|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-130/html/iss022e062672.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=21 September 2012}}</ref>]]\n\n===Other layers===\nWithin the five principal layers that are largely determined by temperature, several secondary layers may be distinguished by other properties:\n* The [[ozone layer]] is contained within the stratosphere. In this layer [[ozone]] concentrations are about 2 to 8 parts per million, which is much higher than in the lower atmosphere but still very small compared to the main components of the atmosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about {{convert|15|-|35|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}, though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About 90% of the ozone in Earth's atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere.\n* The [[ionosphere]] is a region of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation. It is responsible for [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]s. During daytime hours, it stretches from {{convert|50|to|1000|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} and includes the mesosphere, thermosphere, and parts of the exosphere. However, ionization in the mesosphere largely ceases during the night, so auroras are normally seen only in the thermosphere and lower exosphere. The ionosphere forms the inner edge of the [[magnetosphere]]. It has practical importance because it influences, for example, [[radio]] propagation on Earth.\n* The homosphere and heterosphere are defined by whether the atmospheric gases are well mixed. The surface-based homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and the lowest part of the thermosphere, where the chemical composition of the atmosphere does not depend on molecular weight because the gases are mixed by turbulence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=homosphere1|title='&#39;homosphere'&#39;\u2014AMS Glossary|publisher=Amsglossary.allenpress.com|accessdate=2010-10-16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914045832/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=homosphere1|archivedate=14 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref> This relatively homogeneous layer ends at the ''[[turbopause]]'' found at about {{convert|100|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}, the very [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line|edge of space]] itself as accepted by the [[Federation Aeronautique Internationale|FAI]], which places it about {{convert|20|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} above the mesopause.\n:Above this altitude lies the heterosphere, which includes the exosphere and most of the thermosphere. Here, the chemical composition varies with altitude. This is because the [[mean free path|distance that particles can move without colliding with one another]] is large compared with the size of motions that cause mixing. This allows the gases to stratify by molecular weight, with the heavier ones, such as oxygen and nitrogen, present only near the bottom of the heterosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.{{clarify|reason=so what is the intermediate region of the heterosphere composed of??|date=February 2016}}\n* The [[planetary boundary layer]] is the part of the troposphere that is closest to Earth's surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through [[turbulence|turbulent diffusion]]. During the day the planetary boundary layer usually is well-mixed, whereas at night it becomes stably stratified with weak or intermittent mixing. The depth of the planetary boundary layer ranges from as little as about {{convert|100|m|ft}} on clear, calm nights to {{convert |3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} or more during the afternoon in dry regions.\n\nThe average temperature of the atmosphere at Earth's surface is {{convert|14|C|F K|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bambooweb.com/articles/e/a/Earth's_atmosphere.html |title=Earth's Atmosphere |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614054213/http://www.bambooweb.com:80/articles/e/a/Earth's_atmosphere.html |archivedate=2009-06-14 |df= }}</ref> or {{convert|15|C|F K|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/earthfact.html|title=NASA&nbsp;\u2014 Earth Fact Sheet|publisher=Nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov|date=|accessdate=2010-10-16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030234253/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/earthfact.html|archivedate=30 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref> depending on the reference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/anomalies/index.php |title=Global Surface Temperature Anomalies }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://oceanworld.tamu.edu/resources/oceanography-book/radiationbalance.htm|title=Earth's Radiation Balance and Oceanic Heat Fluxes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/cmip/overview_ms/control_tseries.pdf|title=Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Control Run}}</ref>\n\n==Physical properties==\n{{Comparison US standard atmosphere 1962.svg}}\n\n===Pressure and thickness===\n{{Main|Atmospheric pressure}}\n\nThe average atmospheric pressure at [[sea level]] is defined by the [[International Standard Atmosphere]] as {{convert|101325|Pa|Torr psi mmHg|lk=on|comma=off}}.

Atmospheric pressure is the total weight of the air above unit area at the point where the pressure is measured. Thus air pressure varies with location and [[low-pressure area|weather]].\n\nIf the entire mass of the atmosphere had a uniform density from sea level, it would terminate abruptly at an altitude of {{convert|8.50|km|ft|abbr=on}}. It actually decreases exponentially with altitude, dropping by half every {{convert|5.6|km|ft|abbr=on}} or by a factor of 1/[[e (mathematical constant)|e]] every {{convert|7.64|km|ft|abbr=on}}, the average [[scale height]] of the atmosphere below {{convert|70|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. However, the atmosphere is more accurately modeled with a customized equation for each layer that takes gradients of temperature, molecular composition, solar radiation and gravity into account.\n\nIn summary, the mass of Earth's atmosphere is distributed approximately as follows:<ref>Lutgens, Frederick K. and Edward J. Tarbuck (1995) ''The Atmosphere'', Prentice Hall, 6th ed., pp14-17, ISBN 0-13-350612-6</ref>\n* 50% is below {{convert|5.6|km|ft|abbr=on}}.\n* 90% is below {{convert|16|km|ft|abbr=on}}.\n* 99.99997% is below {{convert|100|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}, the [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line]]. By international convention, this marks the beginning of space where human travelers are considered [[astronaut]]s.\n\nBy comparison, the summit of Mt. Everest is at {{convert|8848|m|ft|abbr=on}};\ncommercial [[airliners]] typically cruise between {{convert|10|km|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|13|km|ft|abbr=on}} where the thinner air improves fuel economy; [[weather balloons]] reach {{convert|30.4|km|ft|abbr=on}} and above; and the highest [[North American X-15|X-15]] flight in 1963 reached {{convert|108.0|km|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nEven above the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, significant atmospheric effects such as [[aurora (astronomy)|auroras]] still occur. [[Meteors]] begin to glow in this region, though the larger ones may not burn up until they penetrate more deeply. The various layers of Earth's [[ionosphere]], important to [[HF radio]] propagation, begin below 100&nbsp;km and extend beyond 500&nbsp;km. By comparison, the [[International Space Station]] and [[Space Shuttle]] typically orbit at 350\u2013400&nbsp;km, within the [[F-layer]] of the ionosphere where they encounter enough [[atmospheric drag]] to require reboosts every few months. Depending on solar activity, satellites can experience noticeable atmospheric drag at altitudes as high as 700\u2013800&nbsp;km.\n\n===Temperature and speed of sound===\n{{Main|Atmospheric temperature|Speed of sound}}\n[[File:Atmospheric Temperature Trend.jpg|thumb|These images show temperature trends in two thick layers of the atmosphere as measured by a series of satellite-based instruments between January 1979 and December 2005. The measurements were taken by Microwave Sounding Units and Advanced Microwave Sounding Units flying on a series of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather satellites. The instruments record microwaves emitted from oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. Source:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=7839 |title=Atmospheric Temperature Trends, 1979-2005 : Image of the Day |publisher=Earthobservatory.nasa.gov |date=2000-01-01 |accessdate=2014-06-10}}</ref>]]\n\nThe division of the atmosphere into layers mostly by reference to temperature is discussed above. Temperature decreases with altitude starting at sea level, but variations in this trend begin above 11&nbsp;km, where the temperature stabilizes through a large vertical distance through the rest of the troposphere. In the [[stratosphere]], starting above about 20&nbsp;km, the temperature increases with height, due to heating within the [[ozone layer]] caused by capture of significant [[ultraviolet]] radiation from the [[Sun]] by the dioxygen and ozone gas in this region. Still another region of increasing temperature with altitude occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly-named [[thermosphere]] above 90&nbsp;km.\n\nBecause in an [[ideal gas]] of constant composition the [[speed of sound]] depends only on temperature and not on the gas pressure or density, the speed of sound in the atmosphere with altitude takes on the form of the complicated temperature profile (see illustration to the right), and does not mirror altitudinal changes in density or pressure.\n\n===Density and mass===\n[[File:Atmosphere model.png|thumb|Temperature and mass density against altitude from the [[NRLMSISE-00]] [[International Standard Atmosphere|standard atmosphere]] model (the eight dotted lines in each \"decade\" are at the eight cubes 8, 27, 64, ..., 729)]]\n\n{{Main|Density of air}}\n\nThe density of air at sea level is about 1.2&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup> (1.2&nbsp;g/L, 0.0012 g/cm<sup>3</sup>). Density is not measured directly but is calculated from measurements of temperature, pressure and humidity using the equation of state for air (a form of the [[ideal gas law]]). Atmospheric density decreases as the altitude increases. This variation can be approximately modeled using the [[barometric formula]]. More sophisticated models are used to predict orbital decay of satellites.\n\nThe average mass of the atmosphere is about 5 quadrillion (5{{e|15}}) [[tonne]]s or 1/1,200,000 the mass of Earth. According to the American [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]], \"The total mean mass of the atmosphere is 5.1480{{E|18}}&nbsp;kg with an annual range due to water vapor of 1.2 or 1.5{{E|15}}&nbsp;kg, depending on whether surface pressure or water vapor data are used; somewhat smaller than the previous estimate. The mean mass of water vapor is estimated as 1.27{{E|16}}&nbsp;kg and the dry air mass as 5.1352 \u00b10.0003{{E|18}}&nbsp;kg.\"\n\n==Optical properties==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2013}} \n{{See also|Sunlight}}\n\nSolar [[radiation]] (or sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the [[Sun]]. Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere.\n\n===Scattering===\n{{Main|Scattering}}\n\nWhen light passes through Earth's atmosphere, [[photon]]s interact with it through ''scattering''. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called ''direct radiation'' and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. ''Indirect radiation'' is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an [[overcast]] day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called [[Rayleigh scattering]], shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why [[sunset]]s are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.\n\n===Absorption===\n{{Main|Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)}}\nDifferent molecules absorb different wavelengths of radiation. For example, O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than 300 [[nanometer]]s. Water (H<sub>2</sub>O) absorbs many wavelengths above 700&nbsp;nm. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it increases the energy of the molecule. This heats the atmosphere, but the atmosphere also cools by emitting radiation, as discussed below.\n\n[[File:Atmospheric electromagnetic opacity.svg|thumb|left|Rough plot of Earth's atmospheric [[transmittance]] (or opacity) to various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, including [[visible light]].]]\n\nThe combined [[absorption spectra]] of the gases in the atmosphere leave \"windows\" of low [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]], allowing the transmission of only certain bands of light. The [[optical window]] runs from around 300&nbsp;nm ([[ultraviolet]]-C) up into the range humans can see, the [[visible spectrum]] (commonly called [[light]]), at roughly 400\u2013700&nbsp;nm and continues to the [[infrared]] to around 1100&nbsp;nm. There are also [[Infrared window|infrared]] and [[radio window]]s that transmit some infrared and [[radio waves]] at longer wavelengths. For example, the radio window runs from about one centimeter to about eleven-meter waves.\n\n===Emission===\n{{Main|Emission (electromagnetic radiation)}}\n''Emission'' is the opposite of absorption, it is when an object emits radiation. Objects tend to emit amounts and wavelengths of radiation depending on their \"[[black body]]\" emission curves, therefore hotter objects tend to emit more radiation, with shorter wavelengths. Colder objects emit less radiation, with longer wavelengths. For example, the Sun is approximately {{convert|6000|K|lk=on}}, its radiation peaks near 500&nbsp;nm, and is visible to the human eye. Earth is approximately {{convert|290|K|abbr=on}}, so its radiation peaks near 10,000&nbsp;nm, and is much too long to be visible to humans.\n\nBecause of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on [[cloud]]y nights. This is because clouds (H<sub>2</sub>O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations.\n\nThe [[greenhouse effect]] is directly related to this absorption and emission effect. Some gases in the atmosphere absorb and emit infrared radiation, but do not interact with sunlight in the visible spectrum. Common examples of these are {{CO2}} and H<sub>2</sub>O.\n\n===Refractive index===\nThe [[refractive index]] of air is close to, but just greater than 1. Systematic variations in refractive index can lead to the bending of light rays over long optical paths. One example is that, under some circumstances, observers onboard ships can see other vessels just over the [[horizon]] because light is refracted in the same direction as the [[curvature]] of Earth's surface.\n\nThe refractive index of air depends on temperature, giving rise to refraction effects when the temperature gradient is large. An example of such effects is the [[mirage]].\n\n{{See also|Scintillation (astronomy)}}\n\n==Circulation==\n{{Main|Atmospheric circulation}}\n\n[[File:AtmosphCirc2.png|thumb|right|An idealised view of three large circulation cells.]]\n''Atmospheric circulation'' is the large-scale movement of air through the troposphere, and the means (with [[ocean circulation]]) by which [[heat]] is distributed around Earth. The large-scale structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the basic structure remains fairly constant because it is determined by Earth's rotation rate and the difference in solar radiation between the equator and poles.\n\n==Evolution of Earth's atmosphere==\n{{See also|History of Earth|Paleoclimatology}}\n\n===Earliest atmosphere===\nThe [[paleoatmosphere|first atmosphere]] would have consisted of gases in the [[Solar nebula#Formation of planets|solar nebula]], primarily [[hydrogen]]. In addition, there would probably have been simple hydrides such as those now found in the [[gas giant]]s ([[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]]), notably [[water]] vapor, [[methane]] and [[ammonia]]. As the solar nebula dissipated, these gases would have escaped, partly driven off by the [[solar wind]].<ref name=Zahnle>{{Cite journal | last1 = Zahnle | first1 = K. | last2 = Schaefer | first2 = L. | last3 = Fegley | first3 = B. | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a004895 | title = Earth's Earliest Atmospheres | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 10 | pages = a004895 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20573713| pmc = 2944365}}</ref>\n\n===Second atmosphere===\nOutgassing from [[volcanism]], supplemented by gases produced during the [[late heavy bombardment]] of Earth by huge [[asteroids]], produced the next atmosphere, consisting largely of [[nitrogen]] plus [[carbon dioxide]] and inert gases.<ref name=Zahnle/> A major part of carbon-dioxide emissions soon dissolved in water and built up carbonate sediments.{{clarify|reason=explain how this works?

In the late [[Archean]] [[Eon (geology)|Eon]] an oxygen-containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently produced by photosynthesizing [[cyanobacteria]] (see [[Great Oxygenation Event]]), which have been found as [[stromatolite]] fossils from 2.7 billion years ago. The early basic carbon isotopy ([[isotope ratio]] proportions) very much approximates current conditions, suggesting that the fundamental features of the [[carbon cycle]] became established as early as 4 billion years ago.\n\n[[Proxy (climate)#Lake and ocean sediments|Ancient sediments]] in the [[Gabon]] dating from between about 2,150 and 2,080 million years ago provide a record of Earth's dynamic oxygenation evolution.

Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 2.4 billion years ago during the [[Great Oxygenation Event]] and its appearance is indicated by the end of the [[banded iron formations]]. Before this time, any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by oxidation of reduced materials, notably iron. Molecules of free oxygen did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials. This point signifies a shift from a [[Redox|reducing]] atmosphere to an [[oxidizing]] atmosphere. O<sub>2</sub> showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than 15% by the end of the Precambrian.<ref>Christopher R. Scotese, [http://www.scotese.com/precamb_chart.htm Back to Earth History : Summary Chart for the Precambrian], Paleomar Project</ref> The following time span from 541 million years ago to the present day is the [[Phanerozoic]] Eon, during the earliest period of which, the [[Cambrian]], oxygen-requiring [[metazoan]] life forms began to appear.\n\nThe amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million years, reaching a peak of about 30% around 280 million years ago, significantly higher than today's 21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: Plants [[photosynthesis|use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere]], releasing oxygen. Breakdown of [[pyrite]] and [[volcanic eruption]]s release [[sulfur]] into the atmosphere, which oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid development of animals. Today's atmosphere contains 21% oxygen, which is high enough for this rapid development of animals.<ref>Peter Ward:[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11630] Out of Thin Air: Dinosaurs, Birds, and Earth's Ancient Atmosphere</ref>\n\n[[File:Watching the Earth Breathe.ogv|thumb|This animation shows the buildup of tropospheric {{CO2}} in the Northern Hemisphere with a maximum around May.
