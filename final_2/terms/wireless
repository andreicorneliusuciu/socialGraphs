The most common wireless technologies use [[radio]]. With radio waves distances can be short, such as a few meters for [[television]] or  as far as thousands or even millions of kilometers for deep-space radio communications.  It encompasses various types of fixed, mobile, and portable applications, including [[two-way radio]]s, [[Mobile phone|cellular telephones]], [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs), and [[wireless network]]ing. Other examples of applications of radio ''wireless technology'' include [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] units, [[garage door opener]]s, wireless [[Mouse (computing)|computer mice]], [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboards]] and [[Headset (audio)|headsets]], [[headphone]]s, [[radio receiver]]s, [[satellite television]], [[broadcast television]] and [[cordless telephone]]s.\n\nSomewhat less common methods of achieving wireless communications include the use of other [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] wireless technologies, such as light, magnetic, or electric fields or the use of sound. The term ''wireless'' has been used twice in communications history, with slightly different meaning.  It was initially used from about 1890 for the first radio transmitting and receiving technology, as in ''[[wireless telegraphy]]'', until the new word ''radio'' replaced it around 1920.  The term was revived in the 1980s and 1990s mainly to distinguish digital devices that communicate without wires, such as the examples listed in the previous paragraph, from those that require wires or cables. This is its primary usage in the 2000s. [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]], [[LTE-Advanced]], [[Wi-Fi]] and [[Bluetooth]] are common modern wireless technologies used in the 2000s.\n\nWireless operations permit services, such as long-range communications, that are impossible or impractical to implement with the use of wires. The term is commonly used in the [[telecommunications]] industry to refer to telecommunications systems (e.g. radio transmitters and receivers, remote controls, etc.) which use some form of energy (e.g. [[radio waves]], acoustic energy,) to transfer information without the use of wires.<ref name=\"FS1037C\">{{cite web|title=ATIS Telecom Glossary 2007|url=http://www.atis.org/tg2k/|publisher=atis.org|accessdate=2008-03-16}}</ref> Information is transferred in this manner over both short and long distances.\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of telecommunication}}\n\n=== Photophone ===\n{{Main article|Photophone}}\n[[File:Photophony1.jpg|thumb|right|Bell and Tainter's photophone, of 1880.]]\nThe world's first wireless telephone conversation occurred in 1880, when [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and [[Charles Sumner Tainter]] invented and patented the [[photophone]], a telephone that conducted audio conversations wirelessly over modulated [[light beam]]s (which are narrow projections of [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]]).<!--These two sentences are very wordy--> In that distant era, when utilities did not yet exist to provide [[electricity]] and [[laser]]s had not even been imagined in [[science fiction]], there were no practical applications for their invention, which was highly limited<!--This has a passive voice that is less interesting to read--> by the availability of both sunlight and good weather. Similar to [[free-space optical communication]], the photophone also required a clear line of sight between its transmitter and its receiver. It would be several decades before the photophone's principles found their first practical applications in [[military communications]] and later in [[fiber-optic communication]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Photo- and Graphophone|url=http://www.fi.edu/learn/case-files/bell/phone.html|journal=http://www.fi.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Alexander Graham Bell's Photophone \u2013 Ahead of its Time|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/pstartinventions/a/photophone.htm|journal=http://inventors.about.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Early usage ===\n{{Main article|Wireless telegraphy}}\n\n[[David E.

In 1888, Edison deployed a system of signaling on the Lehigh Valley Railroad. In 1891, Edison obtained the wireless patent for this method using inductance ({{US patent|465971}}).\n\nIn 1888, [[Heinrich Hertz]] demonstrated the existence of [[electromagnetic wave]]s, the underlying basis of most wireless technology.<ref name=\"Story\">{{cite book|last = Story| first = Alfred Thomas| title = A story of wireless telegraphy| publisher = New York, D.

Hertz demonstrated that electromagnetic waves traveled through space in straight lines, could be [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmitted]], and could be [[Receiver (radio)|received]] by an experimental apparatus.<ref name=\"Story\" /><ref name=\"Katz\" /> Hertz did not follow up on the experiments. [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] around this time developed an early wireless detection device and helped increase the knowledge of millimeter-length electromagnetic waves.<ref>J.C.

This contrasts<!--Unclear antecedent--> with other communication technologies that use light beams traveling through [[transmission line]]s such as [[optical fiber]] or dielectric \"light pipes\".\n\nThe technology is useful where physical connections are impractical due to high costs or other considerations.  For example, free space optical links are used in cities between office buildings which are not wired<!--Passive voice--> for networking, where the cost of running cable through the building and under the street would be prohibitive. Another widely used example is [[consumer IR]] devices such as [[remote control]]s and  IrDA ([[Infrared Data Association]]) networking, which is used as an alternative to [[WiFi]] networking to allow laptops, PDAs, printers, and digital cameras to exchange data.\n\n=== Sonic ===\nSonic, especially [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] short range communication involves the transmission and reception of sound.\n\n=== Electromagnetic induction ===\n[[Electromagnetic induction]] short range communication and power. <!--Unclear antecedent-->This has been used in biomedical situations such as pacemakers, as well as for short-range Rfid tags.\n\n== Services ==\nCommon examples of wireless equipment include:<ref>Tech Target \u2013 Definition of Wireless \u2013 Posted by Margaret Rouse (April 2 control and traffic control systems</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Wireless headphones|url=http://headphonescompared.com/the-best-wireless-headphones/|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n*Infrared and ultrasonic remote control devices\n*Professional LMR ([[Land Mobile Radio]]) and SMR (Specialized [[Mobile Radio]]) typically used by business, industrial and Public Safety entities.\n*Consumer [[Two-way radio]] including FRS [[Family Radio Service]], GMRS (General Mobile Radio Service) and Citizens band (\"CB\") radios.\n*The [[Amateur Radio]] Service (Ham radio).\n*Consumer and professional [[Marine radio|Marine VHF radios]].\n*[[Airband]] and [[radio navigation]] equipment used by [[aviator]]s and [[air traffic control]]\n*[[Cellular telephone]]s and pagers: provide connectivity for portable and mobile applications, both personal and business.\n*[[Global Positioning System]] (GPS): allows drivers of cars and trucks, captains of boats and ships, and pilots of aircraft to ascertain their location anywhere on earth.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tsai|first=Allen|title=AT&T Releases Navigator GPS Service with Speech Recognition|url=http://www.telarus.com/industry/att-releases-navigator-gps-service-with-speech-recognition.html|publisher=Telecom Industry News|accessdate=2 April 2008}}</ref>\n*Cordless computer peripherals: the cordless mouse is a common example; wireless headphones, keyboards, and printers can also be linked<!--Passive voice--> to a computer via wireless using technology such as [[Wireless USB]] or [[Bluetooth]]\n*[[Cordless telephone]] sets: these are limited-range devices, not to be confused with cell phones.\n*[[Satellite television]]: Is broadcast from satellites in [[geostationary orbit]].

The frequencies of the [[radio spectrum]] that are available for use for communication are treated as a public resource and are regulated by national organizations such as the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in the USA, or [[Ofcom]] in the United Kingdom. This determines which frequency ranges can be used for what purpose and by whom. In the absence of such control or alternative arrangements such as a privatized electromagnetic spectrum, chaos might result if, for example, airlines did not have specific frequencies to work under and an [[amateur radio]] operator were interfering with the pilot's ability to land an [[aircraft]]. Wireless communication spans the spectrum from 9&nbsp;kHz to 300&nbsp;GHz.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n== Applications  ==\n\n=== Mobile telephones ===\nOne of the best-known examples of wireless technology is the [[mobile phone]], also known as a cellular phone, with more than 4.6 billion mobile cellular subscriptions worldwide as of the end of 2010.<ref>[http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=33770&Cr=Telecom&Cr1= Robust demand for mobile phone service will continue; UN agency predicts] ''UN News Centre'' February 15, 2010,<!--accessed September 6, 2011--></ref> These wireless phones use radio waves from signal-transmission towers to enable their users to make phone calls from many locations worldwide.

Originally these units used bulky, highly local transceivers to mediate between a computer and a keyboard and mouse; however, more recent generations have used small, higher-quality devices. A battery powers computer interface devices such as a keyboard or mouse and send signals to a receiver through a USB port by the way of an optical or radio frequency (RF) receiver. A RF design makes it possible to expand the range of efficient use, usually up to 10 feet but distance, physical obstacles, competing signals, and even human bodies can all degrade the signal quality.<ref>Paventi, Jared. \"How does a Wireless Keyboard Work.\" Ehow.

There are two different fundamental methods for wireless energy transfer. They can be transferred using either far-field methods that involve beaming power/lasers, radio or microwave transmissions or near-field using induction. Both methods utilize electromagnetism and magnetic fields.<ref>Jones, George. \"Future Proof. How Wireless Energy Transfer Will Kill the Power Cable.\" MaximumPC. 14 Sept. 2010.
