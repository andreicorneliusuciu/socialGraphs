It is often used in [[Decorative arts|decorative art]] or as [[interior decoration]]. Most mosaics are made of small, flat, roughly [[square]], pieces of stone or glass of different colors, known as ''[[tesserae]]''. Some, especially floor mosaics, are made of small rounded pieces of stone, and called \"pebble mosaics\". Others are made of other materials.\n\nMosaics have a long history, starting in [[Mesopotamia]] in the 3rd millennium BC. Pebble mosaics were made in [[Tiryns]] in [[Mycenean civilisation|Mycenean]] Greece; mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times, both in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]]. Early Christian [[basilica]]s from the 4th century onwards were decorated with wall and ceiling mosaics. Mosaic art flourished in the [[Byzantine Empire]] from the 6th to the 15th centuries; that tradition was adopted by the [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] kingdom in [[Sicily]] in the 12th century, by eastern-influenced [[Venice]], and among the [[Rus' (people)|Rus]] in Ukraine. Mosaic fell out of fashion in the Renaissance, though artists like [[Raphael]] continued to practise the old technique. Roman and Byzantine influence led Jews to decorate 5th and 6th century synagogues in the Middle East with floor mosaics.\n\nMosaic was widely used on religious buildings and palaces in early [[Islamic art]], including Islam's first great religious building, the Dome of the Rock in [[Jerusalem]], and the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]]. Mosaic went out of fashion in the Islamic world after the 8th century.\n\nModern mosaics are made by professional artists, street artists, and as a popular craft. Many materials other than traditional stone and ceramic tesserae may be employed, including shells, glass and beads.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Deer hunt mosaic from Pella.jpg|thumb|[[Stag Hunt Mosaic]] from the ''House of the Abduction of Helen'' at [[Pella]], [[ancient Macedonia]], late 4th century BC]]\n[[File:The Abduction of Persephone by Pluto, Amphipolis.jpg|300px|thumb|A mosaic of the [[Kasta Tomb]] in [[Amphipolis]] depicting the abduction of [[Persephone]] by [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], 4th century BC]]\nThe earliest known examples of mosaics made of different materials were found at a temple building in Abra, [[Mesopotamia]], and are dated to the second half of 3rd millennium BC.

Most recorded names of Roman mosaic workers are Greek, suggesting they dominated high quality work across the empire; no doubt most ordinary craftsmen were slaves.  Splendid mosaic floors are found in Roman villas across [[North Africa]], in places such as [[Carthage]], and can still be seen in the extensive collection in [[Bardo Museum]] in [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]].\n\nThere were two main techniques in Greco-Roman mosaic: ''[[opus vermiculatum]]'' used tiny ''[[tesserae]]'', typically cubes of 4 millimeters or less, and was produced in workshops in relatively small panels which were transported to the site glued to some temporary support. The tiny ''tesserae'' allowed very fine detail, and an approach to the illusionism of painting.  Often small panels called ''emblemata'' were inserted into walls or as the highlights of larger floor-mosaics in coarser work.  The normal technique was ''[[opus tessellatum]]'', using larger tesserae, which was laid on site.{{sfn|Smith|1983|pp=116\u2013119}}  There was a distinct native Italian style using black on a white background, which was no doubt cheaper than fully coloured work.{{sfn|Smith|1983|pp=121\u2013123}}\n\nIn Rome, Nero and his architects used mosaics to cover some surfaces of walls and ceilings in the ''[[Domus Aurea]]'', built 64 AD, and wall mosaics are also found at [[Pompeii]] and neighbouring sites.  However it seems that it was not until the Christian era that figural wall mosaics became a major form of artistic expression. The Roman church of [[Santa Costanza]], which served as a [[mausoleum]] for one or more of the Imperial family, has both religious mosaic and decorative secular ceiling mosaics on a round vault, which probably  represent the style of contemporary palace decoration.\n\nThe mosaics of the [[Villa Romana del Casale]] near [[Piazza Armerina]] in [[Sicily]] are the largest collection of late Roman mosaics ''in situ'' in the world, and are protected as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The large ''villa rustica'', which was probably owned by Emperor [[Maximian]], was built largely in the early 4th century. The mosaics were covered and protected for 700 years by a landslide that occurred in the 12th Century. The most important pieces are the ''Circus Scene'', the 64m long ''Great Hunting Scene'', the ''Little Hunt'', the ''Labours of Hercules'' and the famous ''Bikini Girls'', showing women undertaking a range of sporting activities in garments that resemble 20th Century [[bikinis]]. The [[peristyle]], the imperial apartments and the [[thermae]] were also decorated with ornamental and [[mythological]] mosaics.<ref name=\"UNESCO casale\">{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/832 |title=Villa Romana del Casale |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |accessdate=15 August 2013}}</ref> Other important examples of Roman mosaic art in Sicily were unearthed on the Piazza Vittoria in [[Palermo]] where two houses were discovered. The most important scenes there depicted ''Orpheus'', ''Alexander the Great's Hunt'' and the ''Four Seasons''.\n\nIn 1913 the [[Zliten mosaic]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] mosaic famous for its many scenes from gladiatorial contests, hunting and everyday life, was discovered in the [[Libyan]] town of [[Zliten]].  In 2000 archaeologists working in [[Leptis Magna]], [[Libya]], uncovered a 30&nbsp;ft length of five colorful mosaics created during the 1st or 2nd century AD. The mosaics show a warrior in combat with a deer, four young men wrestling a wild bull to the ground, and a gladiator resting in a state of fatigue, staring at his slain opponent. The mosaics decorated the walls of a cold plunge pool in a bath house within a Roman villa. The gladiator mosaic is noted by scholars as one of the finest examples of mosaic art ever seen \u2014 a \"masterpiece comparable in quality with the [[Alexander Mosaic]] in [[Pompeii]].\"\n\nA specific genre of Roman mosaic was called ''asaroton'' (Greek for \"unswept floor\"). It depicted in [[trompe l'oeil]] style the feast leftovers on the floors of wealthy houses.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ascsa.edu.gr/pdf/uploads/hesperia/147437.pdf | title=A mosaic floor from a Roman villa at Anaploga | accessdate=3 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Mosaic of The Beauty of Durr\u00ebs.jpg|The mosaic of [[The Beauty of Durr\u00ebs]], late 4th century BC.

The earliest examples of Christian basilicas have not survived, but the mosaics of [[Santa Constanza]] and [[Santa Pudenziana]], both from the 4th century, still exist. The winemaking putti in the [[ambulatory]] of Santa Constanza still follow the classical tradition in that they represent the feast of [[Bacchus]], which symbolizes transformation or change, and are thus appropriate for a mausoleum, the original function of this building. In another great Constantinian basilica, the [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]] the original mosaic floor with typical Roman geometric motifs is partially preserved. The so-called [[Tomb of the Julii]], near the crypt beneath [[St Peter's Basilica]], is a 4th-century vaulted tomb with wall and ceiling mosaics that are given Christian interpretations. The [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Rotunda of Galerius]] in [[Thessaloniki]], converted into a Christian church during the course of the 4th century, was embellished with very high artistic quality mosaics. Only fragments survive of the original decoration, especially a band depicting saints with hands raised in prayer, in front of complex architectural fantasies.\n\nIn the following century [[Ravenna]], the capital of the [[Western Roman Empire]], became the center of late Roman mosaic art (see details in Ravenna section). [[Milan]] also served as the capital of the western empire in the 4th century. In the [[St Aquilinus]] Chapel of the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Milan|Basilica of San Lorenzo]], mosaics executed in the late 4th and early 5th centuries depict Christ with the Apostles and the Abduction of [[Elijah]]; these mosaics are outstanding for their bright colors, naturalism and adherence to the classical canons of order and proportion. The surviving apse mosaic of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]], which shows Christ enthroned between Saint Gervasius and Saint Protasius and angels before a golden background date back to the 5th and to the 8th century, although it was restored many times later. The baptistery of the basilica, which was demolished in the 15th century, had a vault covered with gold-leaf tesserae, large quantities of which were found when the site was excavated. In the small shrine of San Vittore in ciel d'oro, now a chapel of Sant'Ambrogio, every surface is covered with mosaics from the second half of the 5th century. Saint Victor is depicted in the center of the golden dome, while figures of saints are shown on the walls before a blue background. The low spandrels give space for the symbols of the four Evangelists.\n\n[[Albenga|Albingaunum]] was the main Roman port of [[Liguria]]. The octagonal baptistery of the town was decorated in the 5th century with high quality blue and white mosaics representing the Apostles. The surviving remains are somewhat fragmented. [[Massilia]] remained a thriving port and a Christian spiritual center in Southern Gaul where favourable societal and economic conditions ensured the survival of mosaic art in the 5th and 6th centuries. The large baptistery, once the grandest building of its kind in Western Europe, had a geometric floor mosaic which is only known from 19th century descriptions. Other parts of the episcopal complex were also decorated with mosaics as new finds, that were unearthed in the 2000s, attest. The funerary [[Abbey of St. Victor, Marseille|basilica of Saint Victor]], built in a quarry outside the walls, was decorated with mosaics but only a small fragment with blue and green scrolls survived on the intrados of an arch (the basilica was later buried under a medieval abbey).\n\nA mosaic pavement depicting humans, animals and plants from the original 4th-century cathedral of [[Aquileia]] has survived in the later medieval church. This mosaic adopts pagan motifs such as the Nilotic scene, but behind the traditional naturalistic content is Christian symbolism such as the [[ichthys]]. The 6th-century early Christian basilicas of Sant' Eufemia [[:it:Basilica di Sant'Eufemia (Grado)]]  and Santa Maria delle Grazie in [[Grado, Italy|Grado]] also have mosaic floors.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Efthalia|last=Rentetzi |title=stylistic relationships between the mosaic flooring of s.

The [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia]] was decorated with mosaics of high artistic quality in 425\u2013430. The vaults of the small, cross-shaped structure are clad with mosaics on blue background. The central motif above the crossing is a golden cross in the middle of the starry sky. Another great building established by [[Galla Placidia]] was the church of [[San Giovanni Evangelista, Ravenna|San Giovanni Evangelista]]. She erected it in fulfillment of a vow that she made having escaped from a deadly storm in 425 on the sea voyage from Constantinople to Ravenna. The mosaics depicted the storm, portraits of members of the western and eastern imperial family and the bishop of Ravenna, [[Peter Chrysologus]]. They are known only from Renaissance sources because almost all were destroyed in 1747.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ravenna|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12662b.htm|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Ostrogoths]] kept alive the tradition in the 6th century, as the mosaics of the [[Arian Baptistry]], [[Baptistry of Neon]], [[Archbishop's Chapel, Ravenna|Archbishop's Chapel]], and the earlier phase mosaics in the [[Basilica of San Vitale]] and [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]] testify.\n\nAfter 539 Ravenna was reconquered by the Romans in the form of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (Byzantine Empire) and became the seat of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]. The greatest development of Christian mosaics unfolded in the second half of the 6th century. Outstanding examples of Byzantine mosaic art are the later phase mosaics in the Basilica of San Vitale and Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo. The mosaic depicting Emperor Saint [[Justinian I]] and [[Theodora (6th century)|Empress Theodora]] in the Basilica of San Vitale were executed shortly after the Byzantine conquest. The mosaics of the [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe]] were made around 549. The anti-Arian theme is obvious in the apse mosaic of [[San Michele in Affricisco]], executed in 545\u2013547 (largely destroyed; the remains in [[Berlin]]).\n\nThe last example of Byzantine mosaics in Ravenna was commissioned by bishop Reparatus between 673\u201379 in the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe. The mosaic panel in the apse showing the bishop with Emperor [[Constantine IV]] is obviously an imitation of the Justinian panel in San Vitale.\n\n====Butrint====\nThe mosaic pavement of the Vrina Plain basilica of [[Butrint]], [[Albania]] appear to pre-date that of the Baptistery by almost a generation, dating to the last quarter of the 5th or the first years of the 6th century. The mosaic displays a variety of motifs including sea-creatures, birds, terrestrial beasts, fruits, flowers, trees and abstracts \u2013 designed to depict a terrestrial paradise of God\u2019s creation. Superimposed on this scheme are two large tablets, tabulae ansatae, carrying inscriptions. A variety of fish, a crab, a lobster, shrimps, mushrooms, flowers, a stag and two cruciform designs surround the smaller of the two inscriptions, which reads: In fulfilment of the vow (prayer) of those whose names God knows. This anonymous dedicatory inscription is a public demonstration of the benefactors\u2019 humility and an acknowledgement of God\u2019s omniscience.\n\nThe abundant variety of natural life depicted in the Butrint mosaics celebrates the richness of God\u2019s creation; some elements also have specific connotations. The [[kantharos]] vase and vine refer to the [[eucharist]], the symbol of the sacrifice of Christ leading to salvation. Peacocks are symbols of paradise and resurrection; shown eating or drinking from the vase they indicate the route to eternal life. Deer or stags were commonly used as images of the faithful aspiring to Christ: \"As a heart desireth the water brook, so my souls longs for thee, O God.\" Water-birds and fish and other sea-creatures can indicate baptism as well as the members of the Church who are christened.\n\n====Late Antique and Early Medieval Rome====\n{{See also|Late Antique and medieval mosaics in Italy}}\n[[File:RomaSantaMariaMaggioreArcoTrionfaleDxRegistro4.jpg|thumb|5th century mosaic in the triumphal arch of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], Rome]]\n\nChristian mosaic art also flourished in Rome, gradually declining as conditions became more difficult in the [[Early Middle Ages]]. 5th century mosaics can be found over the triumphal arch and in the nave of the basilica of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]. The 27 surviving panels of the nave are the most important mosaic cycle in Rome of this period. Two other important 5th century mosaics are lost but we know them from 17th-century drawings. In the apse mosaic of [[Sant'Agata dei Goti]] (462\u2013472, destroyed in 1589) Christ was seated on a globe with the twelve Apostles flanking him, six on either side. At [[Sant'Andrea in Catabarbara]] (468\u2013483, destroyed in 1686) Christ appeared in the center, flanked on either side by three Apostles. Four streams flowed from the little mountain supporting Christ. The original 5th-century apse mosaic of the [[Santa Sabina]] was replaced by a very similar fresco by [[Taddeo Zuccari]] in 1559. The composition probably remained unchanged: Christ flanked by male and female saints, seated on a hill while lambs drinking from a stream at its feet. All three mosaics had a similar iconography.\n\n6th-century pieces are rare in Rome but the mosaics inside the triumphal arch of the basilica of [[San Lorenzo fuori le mura]] belong to this era. The ''Chapel of Ss. Primo e Feliciano'' in [[Santo Stefano Rotondo]] has very interesting and rare mosaics from the 7th century. This chapel was built by [[Pope Theodore I]] as a family burial place.\n\nIn the 7th\u20139th centuries Rome fell under the influence of Byzantine art, noticeable on the mosaics of [[Santa Prassede]], [[Santa Maria in Domnica]], [[Sant'Agnese fuori le Mura]], [[Santa Cecilia in Trastevere]], [[Santi Nereo e Achilleo]] and the San Venanzio chapel of [[San Giovanni in Laterano]]. The great dining hall of [[Pope Leo III]] in the [[Lateran Palace]] was also decorated with mosaics. They were all destroyed later except for one example, the so-called [[Triclinio Leoniano]] of which a copy was made in the 18th century. Another great work of Pope Leo, the apse mosaic of [[Santa Susanna]], depicted Christ with the Pope and [[Charlemagne]] on one side, and SS. Susanna and Felicity on the other. It was plastered over during a renovation in 1585. Pope [[Paschal I]] (817\u2013824) embellished the church of [[Santo Stefano del Cacco]] with an apsidal mosaic which depicted the pope with a model of the church (destroyed in 1607).\n\nThe fragment of an 8th-century mosaic, the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] is one of the very rare remaining pieces of the medieval decoration of [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]], demolished in the late 16th century. The precious fragment is kept in the sacristy of [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]]. It proves the high artistic quality of the destroyed St. Peter's mosaics.\n\n====Byzantine mosaics====\n{{See also|Early Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East}}\n[[File:Greatpalacemosaic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1<!--size for low image-->|The so-called Gothic chieftain, from the Mosaic Peristyle of the Great Palace of Constantinople]]\n[[File:Peter in Chora.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Saint Peter]] mosaic from the [[Chora Church]]]]\n[[File:Eufrazijeva bazilika - ulazni natpis.jpg|thumb|Byzantine mosaic above the entrance portal of the [[Euphrasian Basilica]] in [[Pore\u010d]], [[Croatia]] (6th century)]]\n\nMosaics were more central to Byzantine culture than to that of Western Europe. Byzantine church interiors were generally covered with golden mosaics. Mosaic art flourished in the [[Byzantine Empire]] from the 6th to the 15th centuries. The majority of Byzantine mosaics were destroyed without trace during wars and conquests, but the surviving remains still form a fine collection.{{sfn|Lowden|1997|pp=whole book}}\n\nThe great buildings of [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]] like the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]], the [[Nea Ekklesia of the Theotokos|Nea Church]] in [[Jerusalem]] and the rebuilt [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]] were certainly embellished with mosaics but none of these survived.\n\nImportant fragments survived from the mosaic floor of the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]] which was commissioned during [[Justinian]]'s reign. The figures, animals, plants all are entirely classical but they are scattered before a plain background. The portrait of a moustached man, probably a Gothic chieftain, is considered the most important surviving mosaic of the Justinianian age. The so-called ''small sekreton'' of the palace was built during [[Justin II]]'s reign around 565\u2013577. Some fragments survive from the mosaics of this vaulted room. The vine scroll motifs are very similar to those in the Santa Constanza and they still closely follow the Classical tradition. There are remains of floral decoration in the [[Church of the Acheiropoietos]] in [[Thessaloniki]] (5th\u20136th centuries).\n\n[[File:St George as patron of two children. Mosaic, church of St Demetrios in Thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|A pre-[[Iconoclastic]] depiction of St. Demetrios at the Hagios Demetrios Basilica in Thessaloniki.]]\nIn the 6th century, [[Ravenna]], the capital of Byzantine Italy, became the center of mosaic making. [[Istria]] also boasts some important examples from this era. The [[Euphrasian Basilica]] in [[Pore\u010d|Parentium]] was built in the middle of the 6th century and decorated with mosaics depicting the [[Theotokos]] flanked by angels and saints.\n\nFragments remain from the mosaics of the [[Church of Santa Maria Formosa]] in [[Pula|Pola]]. These pieces were made during the 6th century by artists from Constantinople. Their pure Byzantine style is different from the contemporary Ravennate mosaics.\n\nVery few early Byzantine mosaics survived the [[Iconoclasm|Iconoclastic]] destruction of the 8th century. Among the rare examples are the 6th-century ''Christ in majesty'' (or ''Ezekiel's Vision'') mosaic in the apse of the [[Church of Hosios David]] in [[Thessaloniki]] that was hidden behind mortar during those dangerous times. Nine mosaic panels in the [[Hagios Demetrios|Hagios Demetrios Church]], which were made between 634 and 730, also escaped destruction. Unusually almost all represent [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki]], often with suppliants before him.\n\nIn the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclastic era]], figural mosaics were also condemned as idolatry. The Iconoclastic churches were embellished with plain gold mosaics with only one great cross in the apse like the [[Hagia Irene]] in Constantinople (after 740). There were similar crosses in the apses of the [[Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki)|Hagia Sophia Church]] in Thessaloniki and in the [[Church of the Dormition, Nicaea|Church of the Dormition]] in [[Iznik|Nicaea]]. The crosses were substituted with the image of the [[Theotokos]] in both churches after the victory of the [[Iconodules]] (787\u2013797 and in 8th\u20139th centuries respectively, the Dormition church was totally destroyed in 1922).\n\nA similar Theotokos image flanked by two archangels were made for the [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople in 867. The dedication inscription says: \"The images which the impostors had cast down here pious emperors have again set up.\" In the 870s the so-called ''large sekreton'' of the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]] was decorated with the images of the four great iconodule patriarchs.\n\nThe post-Iconoclastic era was the heyday of Byzantine art with the most beautiful mosaics executed. The mosaics of the [[Macedonian Renaissance]] (867\u20131056) carefully mingled traditionalism with innovation. Constantinopolitan mosaics of this age followed the decoration scheme first used in Emperor [[Basil I]]'s [[Nea Ekklesia]]. Not only this prototype was later totally destroyed but each surviving composition is battered so it is necessary to move from church to church to reconstruct the system.\n\nAn interesting set of Macedonian-era mosaics make up the decoration of the [[Hosios Loukas]] Monastery. In the narthex there is the Crucifixion, the Pantokrator and the Anastasis above the doors, while in the church the Theotokos (apse), Pentecost, scenes from Christ's life and ermit St Loukas (all executed before 1048). The scenes are treated with a minimum of detail and the panels are dominated with the gold setting.\n[[File:Meister der Nea-Moni-Kirche in Chios 002.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Detail of mosaic from [[Nea Moni]] Monastery]]\nThe [[Nea Moni]] Monastery on [[Chios]] was established by [[Constantine IX Monomachos|Constantine Monomachos]] in 1043\u20131056. The exceptional mosaic decoration of the dome showing probably the nine orders of the angels was destroyed in 1822 but other panels survived (Theotokos with raised hands, four evangelists with seraphim, scenes from Christ's life and an interesting Anastasis where King Salomon bears resemblance to Constantine Monomachos). In comparison with Osios Loukas Nea Moni mosaics contain more figures, detail, landscape and setting.\n\nAnother great undertaking by Constantine Monomachos was the restoration of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]] between 1042 and 1048. Nothing survived of the mosaics which covered the walls and the dome of the edifice but the Russian abbot Daniel, who visited Jerusalem in 1106\u20131107 left a description: \"Lively mosaics of the holy prophets are under the ceiling, over the tribune. The altar is surmounted by a mosaic image of Christ. In the main altar one can see the mosaic of the Exhaltation of Adam. In the apse the Ascension of Christ. The Annunciation occupies the two pillars next to the altar.\"<ref>[http://www.christusrex.com/www1/jhs/TSspdest.html The Holy Sepulchre \u2013 The great destruction of 1009<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe [[Daphni Monastery]] houses the best preserved complex of mosaics from the early Comnenan period (ca. 1100) when the austere and hieratic manner typical for the [[Macedonian dynasty|Macedonian epoch]] and represented by the awesome [[Christ Pantocrator]] image inside the dome, was metamorphosing into a more intimate and delicate style, of which ''The Angel before St Joachim'' \u2014 with its pastoral backdrop, harmonious gestures and pensive lyricism \u2014 is considered a superb example.\n\nThe 9th- and 10th-century mosaics of the [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople are truly classical Byzantine artworks. The north and south tympana beneath the dome was decorated with figures of prophets, saints and patriarchs. Above the principal door from the narthex we can see an ''Emperor kneeling before Christ'' (late 9th or early 10th century). Above the door from the southwest vestibule to the narthex another mosaic shows the ''Theotokos with Justinian and Constantine''. [[Justinian I]] is offering the model of the church to Mary while [[Constantine I|Constantine]] is holding a model of the city in his hand. Both emperors are beardless \u2013 this is an example for conscious archaization as contemporary Byzantine rulers were bearded. A mosaic panel on the gallery shows ''Christ with [[Constantine IX Monomachos|Constantine Monomachos]] and [[Zoe (empress)|Empress Zoe]]'' (1042\u20131055). The emperor gives a bulging [[money sack]] to Christ as a donation for the church.\n\nThe dome of the [[Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki)|Hagia Sophia Church]] in Thessaloniki is decorated with an ''Ascension'' mosaic (c. 885). The composition resembles the great baptistries in [[Ravenna]], with apostles standing between palms and Christ in the middle. The scheme is somewhat unusual as the standard post-Iconoclastic formula for domes contained only the image of the [[Christ Pantocrator|Pantokrator]].\n\n[[File:Christ Pantocrator mosaic from Hagia Sophia 2240 x 3109 pixels 2.5 MB.jpg|thumb|upright|Mosaic of [[Christ Pantocrator]] from [[Hagia Sophia]] from the ''Deesis'' mosaic.]]\n[[File:Santa Sofia - Mosaic de Joan II Comn\u00e8 i la seva esposa, Irene.JPG|thumb|A mosaic from the [[Hagia Sophia]] of [[Constantinople]] (modern Istanbul), depicting [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Jesus]], flanked by [[John II Komnenos]] (left) and his wife [[Irene of Hungary]] (right), c. 1118 AD]]\nThere are very few existing mosaics from the [[Komnenos|Komnenian period]] but this paucity must be due to accidents of survival and gives a misleading impression. The only surviving 12th-century mosaic work in [[Constantinople]] is a panel in Hagia Sophia depicting Emperor [[John II Komnenos|John II]] and Empress [[Piroska of Hungary|Eirene]] with the [[Theotokos]] (1122\u201334). The empress with her long braided hair and rosy cheeks is especially capturing. It must be a lifelike portrayal because Eirene was really a redhead as her original Hungarian name, ''Piroska'' shows. The adjacent portrait of Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] on a pier (from 1122) is similarly personal. The imperial mausoleum of the [[Komnenos]] dynasty, the [[Zeyrek Camii|Pantokrator Monastery]] was certainly decorated with great mosaics but these were later destroyed. The lack of Komnenian mosaics outside the capital is even more apparent. There is only a \"Communion of the Apostles\" in the apse of the cathedral of [[Serres, Greece|Serres]].\n\nA striking technical innovation of the Komnenian period was the production of very precious, miniature mosaic icons. In these icons the small tesserae (with sides of 1&nbsp;mm or less) were set on wax or resin on a wooden panel. These products of extraordinary craftmanship were intended for private devotion. The [[Louvre Transfiguration]] is a very fine example from the late 12th century. The miniature mosaic of Christ in the Museo Nazionale at [[Florence]] illustrates the more gentle, humanistic conception of Christ which appeared in the 12th century.\n\nThe sack of Constantinople in 1204 caused the decline of mosaic art for the next five decades. After the reconquest of the city by [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] in 1261 the Hagia Sophia was restored and a beautiful new ''[[Deesis]]'' was made on the south gallery. This huge mosaic panel with figures two and a half times lifesize is really overwhelming due to its grand scale and superlative craftsmanship. The Hagia Sophia ''Deesis'' is probably the most famous Byzantine mosaic in Constantinople.\n\nThe [[Pammakaristos Church|Pammakaristos Monastery]] was restored by [[Michael Doukas Glabas Tarchaneiotes|Michael Glabas]], an imperial official, in the late 13th century. Only the mosaic decoration of the small burial chapel ([[parekklesion]]) of Glabas survived. This domed chapel was built by his widow, Martha around 1304\u201308. In the miniature dome the traditional Pantokrator can be seen with twelve prophets beneath. Unusually the apse is decorated with a ''[[Deesis]]'', probably due to the funerary function of the chapel.\n\nThe [[Church of the Holy Apostles (Thessaloniki)|Church of the Holy Apostles]] in [[Thessaloniki]] was built in 1310\u201314. Although some vandal systematically removed the gold tesserae of the background it can be seen that the Pantokrator and the prophets in the dome follow the traditional Byzantine pattern. Many details are similar to the Pammakaristos mosaics so it is supposed that the same team of mosaicists worked in both buildings. Another building with a related mosaic decoration is the [[Theotokos Paregoritissa Church]] in [[Arta, Greece|Arta]]. The church was established by the Despot of [[Epirus]] in 1294\u201396. In the dome is the traditional stern Pantokrator, with prophets and cherubim below.\n\n[[File:Chora Church interior March 2008.JPG|thumb|left|Mosaic of Theodore Metochites offering the Chora Church to Christ]]\nThe greatest mosaic work of the [[Palaeologan renaissance in art]] is the decoration of the [[Chora Church]] in Constantinople. Although the mosaics of the naos have not survived except three panels, the decoration of the exonarthex and the esonarthex constitute the most important full-scale mosaic cycle in Constantinople after the Hagia Sophia. They were executed around 1320 by the command of [[Theodore Metochites]]. The esonarthex has two fluted domes, specially created to provide the ideal setting for the mosaic images of the ancestors of Christ. The southern one is called the Dome of the Pantokrator while the northern one is the Dome of the Theotokos. The most important panel of the esonarthex depicts Theodore Metochites wearing a huge [[turban]], offering the model of the church to Christ. The walls of both narthexes are decorated with mosaic cycles from the life of the Virgin and the life of Christ. These panels show the influence of the Italian [[trecento]] on Byzantine art especially the more natural settings, landscapes, figures.\n\nThe last Byzantine mosaic work was created for the Hagia Sophia, Constantinople in the middle of the 14th century. The great eastern arch of the cathedral collapsed in 1346, bringing down the third of the main dome. By 1355 not only the big Pantokrator image was restored but new mosaics were set on the eastern arch depicting the Theotokos, the Baptist and Emperor [[John V Palaiologos]] (discovered only in 1989).\n\nIn addition to the large-scale monuments several miniature mosaic icons of outstanding quality was produced for the Palaiologos court and nobles. The loveliest examples from the 14th century are ''Annunciation'' in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and a mosaic diptych in the Cathedral Treasury of [[Florence]] representing the ''Twelve Feasts of the Church''.\n\nIn the troubled years of the 15th century the fatally weakened empire could not afford luxurious mosaics. Churches were decorated with wall-paintings in this era and after the [[Fall of Constantinople|Turkish conquest]].\n\n====Rome in the High Middle Ages====\n[[File:Apse mosaic SM Maggiore.jpg|thumb|Apse mosaic in the [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]]]\nThe last great period of Roman mosaic art was the 12th\u201313th century when [[Rome]] developed its own distinctive artistic style, free from the strict rules of eastern tradition and with a more realistic portrayal of figures in the space. Well-known works of this period are the floral mosaics of the [[Basilica di San Clemente]], the fa\u00e7ade of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] and [[San Paolo fuori le Mura]]. The beautiful apse mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere (1140) depicts Christ and Mary sitting next to each other on the heavenly throne, the first example of this iconographic scheme. A similar mosaic, the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], decorates the apse of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]. It is a work of [[Jacopo Torriti]] from 1295. The mosaics of Torriti and [[Jacopo da Camerino]] in the apse of [[San Giovanni in Laterano]] from 1288\u201394 were thoroughly restored in 1884. The apse mosaic of [[San Crisogono]] is attributed to [[Pietro Cavallini]], the greatest Roman painter of the 13th century. Six scenes from the life of Mary in Santa Maria in Trastevere were also executed by Cavallini in 1290. These mosaics are praised for their realistic portrayal and attempts of perspective. There is an interesting mosaic medaillon from 1210 above the gate of the church of [[San Tommaso in Formis]] showing Christ enthroned between a white and a black slave. The church belonged to the Order of the [[Trinitarians]] which was devoted to ransoming Christian slaves.\n\nThe great [[Navicella (mosaic)|''Navicella'' mosaic]] (1305\u20131313) in the atrium of the Old St. Peter's is attributed to [[Giotto di Bondone]]. The giant mosaic, commissioned by Cardinal [[Jacopo Stefaneschi]], was originally situated on the eastern porch of the old basilica and occupied the whole wall above the entrance arcade facing the courtyard. It depicted St. Peter walking on the waters. This extraordinary work was mainly destroyed during the construction of the new St. Peter's in the 17th century. Navicella means \"little ship\" referring to the large boat which dominated the scene, and whose sail, filled by the storm, loomed over the horizon. Such a natural representation of a seascape was known only from ancient works of art.\n\n====Sicily====\n[[File:Chapelle Palatine.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Saracen]] arches and Byzantine mosaics in the [[Cappella Palatina]] of [[Roger II of Sicily]]]]\n\nThe heyday of mosaic making in [[Sicily]] was the age of the independent [[Normans|Norman]] kingdom in the 12th century. The Norman kings adopted the Byzantine tradition of mosaic decoration to enhance the somewhat dubious legality of their rule. Greek masters working in Sicily developed their own style, that shows the influence of Western European and Islamic artistic tendencies. Best examples of Sicilian mosaic art are the [[Cappella Palatina]] of [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]],<ref>''Some Palatine Aspects of the Cappella Palatina in Palermo'', Slobodan \u0106ur\u010di\u0107, '''Dumbarton Oaks Papers''', Vol. 41, 139.</ref> the [[Martorana]] church in [[Palermo]] and the cathedrals of [[cathedral of Cefal\u00f9|Cefal\u00f9]] and [[Monreale]].\n\nThe Cappella Palatina clearly shows evidence for blending the eastern and western styles. The dome (1142\u201342) and the eastern end of the church (1143\u20131154) were decorated with typical Byzantine mosaics i.e. Pantokrator, angels, scenes from the life of Christ. Even the inscriptions are written in Greek. The narrative scenes of the nave (Old Testament, life of Sts Peter and Paul) are resembling to the mosaics of the Old St. Peter's and St. Paul's Basilica in [[Rome]] (Latin inscriptions, 1154\u201366).\n\nThe Martorana church (decorated around 1143) looked originally even more Byzantine although important parts were later demolished. The dome mosaic is similar to that of the Cappella Palatina, with Christ enthroned in the middle and four bowed, elongated angels. The Greek inscriptions, decorative patterns, and evangelists in the [[squinches]] are obviously executed by the same Greek masters who worked on the Cappella Palatina. The mosaic depicting Roger II of Sicily, dressed in Byzantine imperial robes and receiving the crown by Christ, was originally in the demolished [[narthex]] together with another panel, the [[Theotokos]] with Georgios of Antiochia, the founder of the church.\n\nIn [[Cefal\u00f9]] (1148) only the high, French Gothic presbytery was covered with mosaics: the [[Christ Pantocrator|Pantokrator]] on the semidome of the apse and [[cherubim]] on the vault. On the walls are Latin and Greek saints, with Greek inscriptions.\n\n[[File:Dedication mosaic - Cathedral of Monreale - Italy 2015 (crop).JPG|thumb|upright|[[Monreale]] mosaics: William II offering the [[Monreale Cathedral]] to the [[Virgin Mary]]]]\nThe [[Monreale]] mosaics constitute the largest decoration of this kind in Italy, covering 0,75 hectares with at least 100 million glass and stone tesserae. This huge work was executed between 1176 and 1186 by the order of King [[William II of Sicily]]. The iconography of the mosaics in the presbytery is similar to Cefalu while the pictures in the nave are almost the same as the narrative scenes in the Cappella Palatina. The Martorana mosaic of Roger II blessed by Christ was repeated with the figure of King William II instead of his predecessor. Another panel shows the king offering the model of the cathedral to the Theotokos.\n\nThe [[Cathedral of Palermo]], rebuilt by Archbishop Walter in the same time (1172\u201385), was also decorated with mosaics but none of these survived except the 12th-century image of ''Madonna del Tocco'' above the western portal.\n\nThe cathedral of [[Messina]], consecrated in 1197, was also decorated with a great mosaic cycle, originally on par with Cefal\u00f9 and Monreale, but heavily damaged and restored many times later. In the left apse of the same cathedral 14th-century mosaics survived, representing the Madonna and Child between Saints Agata and Lucy, the Archangels Gabriel and Michael and Queens Eleonora and Elisabetta.\n\nSouthern Italy was also part of the Norman kingdom but great mosaics did not survive in this area except the fine mosaic pavement of the [[Otranto Cathedral]] from 1166, with mosaics tied into a tree of life, mostly still preserved. The scenes depict biblical characters, warrior kings, medieval beasts, allegories of the months and working activity. Only fragments survived from the original mosaic decoration of [[Amalfi]]'s Norman Cathedral. The mosaic ambos in the churches of [[Ravello]] prove that mosaic art was widespread in Southern Italy during the 11th\u201313th centuries.\n\nThe palaces of the Norman kings were decorated with mosaics depicting animals and landscapes. The secular mosaics are seemingly more Eastern in character than the great religious cycles and show a strong Persian influence. The most notable examples are the ''Sala di Ruggero'' in the [[Palazzo dei Normanni]], [[Palermo]] and the ''Sala della Fontana'' in the [[Zisa, Palermo|Zisa]] summer palace, both from the 12th century.\n\n====Venice====\n\nIn parts of [[Italy]], which were under eastern artistic influences, like [[Sicily]] and [[Venice]], mosaic making never went out of fashion in the Middle Ages. The whole interior of the [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice is clad with elaborate, golden mosaics. The oldest scenes were executed by Greek masters in the late 11th century but the majority of the mosaics are works of local artists from the 12th\u201313th centuries. The decoration of the church was finished only in the 16th century. One hundred and ten scenes of mosaics in the atrium of St Mark's were based directly on the miniatures of the [[Cotton Genesis]], a Byzantine manuscript that was brought to Venice after the sack of Constantinople (1204). The mosaics were executed in the 1220s.\n\nOther important Venetian mosaics can be found in the [[Torcello Cathedral|Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta]] in [[Torcello]] from the 12th century, and in the Basilical of Santi Maria e Donato in [[Murano]] with a restored apse mosaic from the 12th century and a beautiful mosaic pavement (1140). The apse of the San Cipriano Church in Murano was decorated with an impressive golden mosaic from the early 13th century showing Christ enthroned with Mary, St John and the two patron saints, Cipriano and Cipriana. When the church was demolished in the 19th century, the mosaic was bought by [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]]. It was reassembled in the [[Church of Peace (Sanssouci)|Friedenskirche]] of [[Potsdam]] in the 1840s.\n\n[[Trieste]] was also an important center of mosaic art. The mosaics in the apse of the [[Cathedral of San Giusto, Trieste|Cathedral of San Giusto]] were laid by master craftsmen from [[Veneto]] in the 12th\u201313th centuries.\n\n====Medieval Italy====\nThe monastery of [[Grottaferrata]] founded by Greek [[Basilian monks]] and consecrated by the Pope in 1024 was decorated with Italo-Byzantine mosaics, some of which survived in the narthex and the interior. The mosaics on the triumphal arch portray the Twelve Apostles sitting beside an empty throne, evoking Christ's ascent to Heaven. It is a Byzantine work of the 12th century. There is a beautiful 11th-century Deesis above the main portal.\n\nThe Abbot of [[Monte Cassino]], [[Pope Victor III|Desiderius]] sent envoys to [[Constantinople]] some time after 1066 to hire expert Byzantine mosaicists for the decoration of the rebuilt abbey church. According to chronicler [[Leo of Ostia]] the Greek artists decorated the apse, the arch and the vestibule of the basilica. Their work was admired by contemporaries but was totally destroyed in later centuries except two fragments depicting greyhounds (now in the Monte Cassino Museum). \"The abbot in his wisdom decided that great number of young monks in the monastery should be thoroughly initiated in these arts\" \u2013 says the chronicler about the role of the Greeks in the revival of mosaic art in medieval Italy.\n\n[[File:Florenca133b.jpg|thumb|[[Florence Baptistry]]]]\nIn [[Florence]] a magnificiant mosaic of the [[Last Judgement]] decorates the dome of the [[Florence Baptistery|Baptistery]]. The earliest mosaics, works of art of many unknown Venetian craftsmen (including probably [[Cimabue]]), date from 1225. The covering of the ceiling was probably not completed until the 14th century.\n\nThe impressive mosaic of Christ in Majesty, flanked by the Blessed Virgin and St. John the Evangelist in the apse of the [[Piazza dei Miracoli|cathedral of Pisa]] was designed by [[Cimabue]] in 1302. It evokes the Monreale mosaics in style. It survived the great fire of 1595 which destroyed most of the mediveval interior decoration.\n\nSometimes not only church interiors but fa\u00e7ades were also decorated with mosaics in Italy like in the case of the [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice (mainly from the 17th\u201319th centuries, but the oldest one from 1270\u201375, \"The burial of St Mark in the first basilica\"), the [[Duomo di Orvieto|Cathedral of Orvieto]] (golden Gothic mosaics from the 14th century, many times redone) and the [[Basilica di San Frediano]] in [[Lucca]] (huge, striking golden mosaic representing the Ascension of Christ with the apostles below, designed by [[Berlinghiero Berlinghieri]] in the 13th century). The [[Cathedral of Spoleto]] is also decorated on the upper fa\u00e7ade with a huge mosaic portraying the ''Blessing Christ'' (signed by one Solsternus from 1207).\n\n====Western and Central Europe====\n[[File:st.peters.basilica.tesserae.arp.jpg|thumb|left|A \u201cpainting\u201d made from tesserae in [[St Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican State]], Italy]]\n\nBeyond the [[Alps]] the first important example of mosaic art was the decoration of the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]], commissioned by [[Charlemagne]]. It was completely destroyed in a fire in 1650. A rare example of surviving Carolingian mosaics is the [[apse]] [[semi-dome]] decoration of the oratory of [[Germigny-des-Pr\u00e9s]] built in 805\u2013806 by [[Theodulf]], [[bishop of Orl\u00e9ans]], a leading figure of the [[Carolingian renaissance]]. This unique work of art, rediscovered only in the 19th century, had no followers.\n\nOnly scant remains prove that mosaics were still used in the Early Middle Ages. The Abbey of Saint-Martial in [[Limoges]], originally an important place of pilgrimage, was totally demolished during the [[French Revolution]] except its crypt which was rediscovered in the 1960s. A mosaic panel was unearthed which was dated to the 9th century. It somewhat incongruously uses cubes of gilded glass and deep green marble, probably taken from antique pavements. This could also be the case with the early 9th century mosaic found under the [[Basilica of Saint-Quentin]] in [[Picardy]], where antique motifs are copied but using only simple colors. The mosaics in the Cathedral of Saint-Jean at [[Lyon]] have been dated to the 11th century because they employ the same non-antique simple colors. More fragments were found on the site of Saint-Croix at [[Poitiers]] which might be from the 6th or 9th century.\n\n[[File:st.peters.basilica.tesserae.closeup.arp.jpg|thumb|left|Close up of the bottom left corner of the picture above. Click the picture to see the individual [[tessera]]e]]\n\nLater fresco replaced the more labor-intensive technique of mosaic in Western-Europe, although mosaics were sometimes used as decoration on medieval cathedrals. The Royal Basilica of the Hungarian kings in [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]] (Alba Regia) had a mosaic decoration in the apse. It was probably a work of Venetian or Ravennese craftsmen, executed in the first decades of the 11th century. The mosaic was almost totally destroyed together with the basilica in the 17th century. The Golden Gate of the [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] in [[Prague]] got its name from the golden 14th-century mosaic of the [[Last Judgement]] above the portal. It was executed by Venetian craftsmen.\n\n[[File:Germigny Jplm.jpg|thumb|right|Carolingian mosaic in [[Germigny-des-Pr\u00e9s]]]]\nThe [[Crusaders]] in the [[Holy Land]] also adopted mosaic decoration under local Byzantine influence. During their 12th-century reconstruction of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]] they complemented the existing Byzantine mosaics with new ones. Almost nothing of them survived except the \"Ascension of Christ\" in the Latin Chapel (now confusingly surrounded by many 20th-century mosaics). More substantial fragments were preserved from the 12th-century mosaic decoration of the [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]]. The mosaics in the nave are arranged in five horizontal bands with the figures of the ancestors of Christ, Councils of the Church and angels. In the apses the Annunciation, the Nativity, Adoration of the Magi and Dormition of the Blessed Virgin can be seen. The program of redecoration of the church was completed in 1169 as a unique collaboration of the Byzantine emperor, the [[king of Jerusalem]] and the Latin Church.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Art and Colonialism: The mosaics of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem (1169) and the problem of the ''crusader'' art |author=Lucy-Anne Hunt |date= |work= |publisher=  |jstor=1291693 |pages=69\u201385}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the remains of a mosaic pavement were discovered under the ruins of the [[Frumu\u015feni Mosaics|Bizere Monastery]] near the River [[Mure\u0219 River|Mure\u015f]] in present-day [[Romania]]. The panels depict real or fantastic animal, floral, solar and geometric representations. Some archeologists supposed that it was the floor of an Orthodox church, built some time between the 10th and 11th century. Other experts claim that it was part of the later Catholic monastery on the site because it shows the signs of strong Italianate influence. The monastery was situated that time in the territory of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].\n\n====Renaissance and Baroque====\nAlthough mosaics went out of fashion and were substituted by frescoes, some of the great Renaissance artists also worked with the old technique. [[Raphael]]'s [[Creation of the World (Raphael)|Creation of the World]] in the dome of the [[Chigi Chapel]] in [[Santa Maria del Popolo]] is a notable example that was executed by a Venetian craftsman, Luigi di Pace.\n\nDuring the papacy of [[Clement VIII]] (1592\u20131605), the \u201cCongregazione della Reverenda Fabbrica di San Pietro\" was established, providing an independent organisation charged with completing the decorations in the newly built [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. Instead of frescoes the cavernous Basilica was mainly decorated with mosaics. Among the explanations are:\n# The old St. Peter's Basilica had been decorated with mosaic, as was common in churches built during the early Christian era; the 17th century followed the tradition to enhance continuity.\n# In a church like this with high walls and few windows, mosaics were brighter and reflected more light.\n# Mosaics had greater intrinsic longevity than either frescoes or canvases.\n# Mosaics had an association with bejeweled decoration, flaunting richness.\n\nThe mosaics of St. Peter's often show lively [[Baroque]] compositions based on designs or canvases from like [[Ciro Ferri]], [[Guido Reni]], [[Domenichino]], [[Carlo Maratta]], and many others. [[Raphael]] is represented by a mosaic replica of this last painting, the [[Transfiguration (Raphael)|Transfiguration]]. Many different artists contributed to the 17th- and 18th-century mosaics in St. Peter's, including [[Giovanni Battista Calandra]], [[Fabio Cristofari]] (died 1689), and [[Pietro Paolo Cristofari]] (died 1743).<ref>DiFederico, F. R. (1983), ''The mosaics of Saint Peter's Decorating the New Basilica'', University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, pp. 3\u201326.</ref> Works of the Fabbrica were often used as papal gifts.\n\n====The Christian East====\n{{Main article|Early Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East}}\n\n[[File:Madaba map.jpg|thumb|[[Jerusalem]] on the [[Madaba Map]]]]\nThe eastern provinces of the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]] and later the [[Byzantine Empire]]s inherited a strong artistic tradition from the [[Late Antiquity]]. Similarly to [[Italy]] and [[Constantinople]] churches and important secular buildings in the [[region of Syria]] and [[Egypt]] were decorated with elaborate mosaic panels between the 5th and 8th centuries. The great majority of these works of art were later destroyed but archeological excavations unearthed many surviving examples.\n\nThe single most important piece of Byzantine Christian mosaic art in the East is the [[Madaba Map]], made between 542 and 570 as the floor of the church of Saint George at [[Madaba]], [[Jordan]]. It was rediscovered in 1894. The Madaba Map is the oldest surviving cartographic depiction of the [[Holy Land]]. It depicts an area from [[Lebanon]] in the north to the [[Nile Delta]] in the south, and from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the west to the [[Arabian Desert|Eastern Desert]]. The largest and most detailed element of the topographic depiction is [[Jerusalem]], at the center of the map. The map is enriched with many naturalistic features, like animals, fishing boats, bridges and palm trees\n\nOne of the earliest examples of Byzantine mosaic art in the region can be found on [[Mount Nebo (Jordan)|Mount Nebo]], an important place of pilgrimage in the Byzantine era where [[Moses]] died. Among the many 6th-century mosaics in the church complex (discovered after 1933) the most interesting one is located in the baptistery. The intact floor mosaic covers an area of 9 x 3 m and was laid down in 530. It depicts hunting and pastoral scenes with rich Middle Eastern flora and fauna.\n[[File:Nebo05(js).jpg|thumb|left|Mosaic floor from the church on [[Mount Nebo (Jordan)|Mount Nebo]] (baptistery, 530)]]\nThe Church of Sts. Lot and Procopius was founded in 567 in Nebo village under Mount Nebo (now [[Khirbet Mukhayyat]]). Its floor mosaic depicts everyday activities like grape harvest. Another two spectacular mosaics were discovered in the ruined Church of Preacher John nearby. One of the mosaics was placed above the other one which was completely covered and unknown until the modern restoration. The figures on the older mosaic have thus escaped the iconoclasts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jordanjubilee.com/visitjor/sites2.htm |title=Khirbet al Mukhayat |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe town of [[Madaba]] remained an important center of mosaic making during the 5th\u20138th centuries. In the Church of the Apostles the middle of the main panel Thalassa, goddess of the sea, can be seen surrounded by fishes and other sea creatures. Native Middle Eastern birds, mammals, plants and fruits were also added.<ref>[http://www.jordanjubilee.com/history/mosaics.htm The mosaics of Jordan<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n[[File:Saint Catherine's Transfiguration.jpg|thumb|The Transfiguration of Jesus in the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]]]]\nImportant Justinian era mosaics decorated the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] on [[Mount Sinai]] in [[Egypt]]. Generally wall mosaics have not survived in the region because of the destruction of buildings but the St. Catherine's Monastery is exceptional. On the upper wall [[Moses]] is shown in two panels on a landscape background. In the apse we can see the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]] on a golden background. The apse is surrounded with bands containing medallions of apostles and prophets, and two contemporary figure, \"Abbot Longinos\" and \"John the Deacon\". The mosaic was probably created in 565/6.\n\n[[Jerusalem]] with its many holy places probably had the highest concentration of mosaic-covered churches but very few of them survived the subsequent waves of destructions. The present remains do not do justice to the original richness of the city. The most important is the so-called \"Armenian Mosaic\" which was discovered in 1894 on the [[Street of the Prophets]] near [[Damascus Gate]]. It depicts a vine with many branches and grape clusters, which springs from a vase. Populating the vine's branches are peacocks, ducks, storks, pigeons, an eagle, a partridge, and a parrot in a cage. The inscription reads: \"For the memory and salvation of all those Armenians whose name the Lord knows.\" Beneath a corner of the mosaic is a small, natural cave which contained human bones dating to the 5th or 6th centuries. The symbolism of the mosaic and the presence of the burial cave indicates that the room was used as a [[mortuary]] chapel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/jerusalem-armenian-mosaic.htm |title=Armenian Mosaic, Jerusalem |year=2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010 |publisher=Sacred-destinations.com}}</ref>\n\nAn exceptionally well preserved, carpet-like mosaic floor was uncovered in 1949 in [[al-Eizariya|Bethany]], the early Byzantine church of the [[Tomb of Lazarus (al-Eizariya)|Lazarium]] which was built between 333 and 390. Because of its purely geometrical pattern, the church floor is to be grouped with other mosaics of the time in Palestine and neighboring areas, especially the Constantinian mosaics in the central nave at Bethlehem.<ref>[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/san/BET04byz.html Bethany in Byzantine times I<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A second church was built above the older one during the 6th century with another more simple geometric mosaic floor.\n\n[[File:Masada Byzantine Church floor mosaic by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|Detail from the mosaic floor of the Byzantine church of in [[Masada]]. The monastic community lived here in the 5th\u20137th centuries.]]\nThe [[monastic]] communities of the [[Judean Desert]] also decorated their monasteries with mosaic floors. The [[Monastery of Martyrius]] was founded in the end of the 5th century and it was re-discovered in 1982\u201385. The most important work of art here is the intact geometric mosaic floor of the refectory although the severely damaged church floor was similarly rich.<ref>[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Early%20History%20-%20Archaeology/The%20Monastery%20of%20Martyrius The Monastery of Martyrius<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The mosaics in the church of the nearby [[Monastery of Euthymius]] are of later date (discovered in 1930). They were laid down in the Umayyad era, after a devastating earthquake in 659. Two six pointed stars and a red chalice are the most important surviving features.\n\n[[File:Petra-Mosaic-2-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail from the mosaic floor of the [[Petra|Petra Church]]]]\nMosaic art also flourished in Christian [[Petra]] where three Byzantine churches were discovered. The most important one was uncovered in 1990. It is known that the walls were also covered with golden glass mosaics but only the floor panels survived as usual. The mosaic of the seasons in the southern aisle is from this first building period from the middle of the 5th century. In the first half of the 6th century the mosaics of the northern aisle and the eastern end of the southern aisle were installed. They depict native as well as exotic or mythological animals, and personifications of the Seasons, Ocean, Earth and Wisdom.<ref>[http://mosaicartsource.wordpress.com/2007/01/21/petra-church-mosaic-floors-petra-jordan/ Petra Church \u2013 Mosaic Floors \u2013 Petra, Jordan \u00ab Mosaic Art Source<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe Arab conquest of the [[Middle East]] in the 7th century did not break off the art of mosaic making. Arabs learned and accepted the craft as their own and carried on the classical tradition. During the Umayyad era Christianity retained its importance, churches were built and repaired and some of the most important mosaics of the Christian East were made during the 8th century when the region was under Islamic rule.\n\nThe mosaics of the Church of St Stephen in ancient Kastron Mefaa (now [[Umm ar-Rasas]]) were made in 785 (discovered after 1986). The perfectly preserved mosaic floor is the largest one in Jordan. On the central panel hunting and fishing scenes are depicted while another panel illustrates the most important cities of the region. The frame of the mosaic is especially decorative. Six mosaic masters signed the work: Staurachios from Esbus, Euremios, Elias, Constantinus, Germanus and Abdela. It overlays another, damaged, mosaic floor of the earlier (587) \"Church of Bishop Sergius.\" Another four churches were excavated nearby with traces of mosaic decoration.\n\nThe last great mosaics in Madaba were made in 767 in the Church of the Virgin Mary (discovered in 1887). It is a masterpiece of the geometric style with a Greek inscription in the central medallion.\n\nWith the fall of the [[Umayyad dynasty]] in 750 the Middle East went through deep cultural changes. No great mosaics were made after the end of the 8th century and the majority of churches gradually fell into disrepair and were eventually destroyed. The tradition of mosaic making died out among the Christians and also in the Islamic community.\n\n====Orthodox countries====\n[[File:Michael of salonica.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Early 12th-century [[Kiev]]an mosaic depicting [[St. Demetrius]].]]\n\nThe craft has also been popular in early medieval [[Rus' (people)|Rus]], inherited as part of the Byzantine tradition. [[Yaroslav I the Wise|Yaroslav]], the Grand Prince of the [[Kievan Rus']] built a large cathedral in his capital, [[Kiev]]. The model of the church was the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]], and it was also called [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|Saint Sophia Cathedral]]. It was built mainly by Byzantine master craftsmen, sent by [[Constantine IX Monomachos|Constantine Monomachos]], between 1037 and 1046. Naturally the more important surfaces in the interior were decorated with golden mosaics. In the dome we can see the traditional stern [[Christ Pantocrator|Pantokrator]] supported by angels. Between the 12 windows of the drum were apostles and the four evangelists on the pendentives. The apse is dominated by an orant [[Theotokos]] with a [[Deesis]] in three medallions above. Below is a Communion of the Apostles.\n[[File:Gelati conch mosaic.JPG|thumb|left|Apse mosaic \"Glory of the Theotokos\" in [[Gelati Monastery|Gelati]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. c. 1125\u20131130.]]\nPrince [[Sviatopolk II of Kiev|Sviatopolk II]] built [[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery]] in [[Kiev]] in 1108. The mosaics of the church are undoubtedly works of Byzantine artists. Although the church was destroyed by Soviet authorities, majority of the panels were preserved. Small parts of ornamental mosaic decoration from the 12th century survived in the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod|Saint Sophia Cathedral]] in [[Novgorod]] but this church was largely decorated with frescoes.\n\nUsing mosaics and frescoes in the same building was a unique practice in Ukraine. Harmony was achieved by using the same dominant colors in mosaic and fresco. Both Saint Sophia Cathedral and Saint Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery  in Kiev use this technique.<ref name=\"Internet encyclopedia of Ukraine\">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/Art.asp|title=The art of fresco painting in Ukraine|work=Internet encyclopedia of Ukraine|accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref> Mosaics stopped being used for church decoration as early as the 12th century in the eastern Slavic countries. Later Russian churches were decorated with frescoes, similarly then orthodox churches in the Balkan.\n\nThe apse mosaic of the [[Gelati Monastery]] is a rare example of mosaic use in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Began by king [[David IV of Georgia|David IV]] and completed by his son [[Demetrius I of Georgia]], the fragmentary panel depicts Theotokos flanked by two archangels. The use of mosaic in Gelati attests to some Byzantine influence in the country and was a demonstration of the imperial ambition of the Bagrationids. The mosaic covered church could compete in magnificence with the churches of Constantinople. Gelati is one of few mosaic creations which survived in Georgia but fragments prove that the early churches of Pitsunda and Tsromi were also decorated with mosaic as well as other, lesser known sites. The destroyed 6th century mosaic floors in the [[Pitsunda Cathedral]] have been inspired by Roman prototypes. In [[Tsromi]] the tesserae are still visible on the walls of the 7th-century church but only faint lines hint at the original scheme. Its central figure was Christ standing and displaying a scroll with Georgian text.\n\n===Jewish mosaics===\n[[File:ZodiacMosaicTzippori.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zodiac]] wheel on the floor of the [[synagogue]] in [[Sepphoris]]]]\nUnder Roman and Byzantine influence Jews also decorated their [[synagogue]]s with classical floor mosaics. Many interesting examples were discovered in [[Galilee]] and the [[Judean Desert]].\n\nThe remains of a 6th-century synagogue have been uncovered in [[Sepphoris]], which was an important centre of Jewish culture between the 3rd\u20137th centuries and a multicultural town inhabited by Jews, Christians and pagans. The mosaic reflects an interesting fusion of Jewish and pagan beliefs. In the center of the floor the [[zodiac]] wheel was depicted. [[Helios]] sits in the middle, in his sun chariot, and each [[zodiac]] is matched with a [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish month]]. Along the sides of the mosaic are strips depicting Biblical scenes, such as the binding of [[Isaac]], as well as traditional rituals, including a burnt sacrifice and the offering of fruits and grains.\n\nAnother zodiac mosaic decorated the floor of the [[Beit Alfa]] synagogue which was built during the reign of [[Justin I]] (518\u201327). It is regarded one of the most important mosaics discovered in Israel. Each of its three panels depicts a scene \u2013 the Holy Ark, the zodiac, and the story of the sacrifice of Isaac. In the center of the zodiac is [[Helios]], the sun god, in his chariot. The four women in the corners of the mosaic represent the four seasons.\n\nA third superbly preserved zodiac mosaic was discovered in the [[Severus synagogue]] in the ancient resort town of [[Tiberias|Hammat Tiberias]]. In the center of the 4th-century mosaic the Sun god, Helios sits in his chariot holding the celestial sphere and a whip. Nine of the 12 signs of the zodiac survived intact. Another panel shows the Ark of Covenant and Jewish cultic objects used in the Temple at Jerusalem.\n\nIn 1936, a synagogue was excavated in [[Jericho]] which was named [[Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue]] after an inscription on its mosaic floor (\"Peace on Israel\"). It appears to have been in use from the 5th to 8th centuries and contained a big mosaic on the floor with drawings of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]], a [[Shofar]] and a [[Lulav]]. Nearby in [[Naaran]], there is another synagogue (discovered in 1918) from the 6th century that also has a mosaic floor.\n\nThe synagogue in [[Eshtemoa synagogue|Eshtemoa]] ([[As-Samu]]) was built around the 4th century. The mosaic floor is decorated with only floral and geometric patterns. The synagogue in [[Khirbet Susiya]] (excavated in 1971\u201372, founded in the end of the 4th century) has three mosaic panels, the eastern one depicting a [[Torah]] shrine, two [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]]s, a [[lulav]] and an [[Etrog (ritual)|etrog]] with columns, deer and rams. The central panel is geometric while the western one is seriously damaged but it has been suggested that it depicted [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] in the lion\u2019s den. The Roman synagogue in [[Ein Gedi]] was remodeled in the Byzantine era and a more elaborate mosaic floor was laid down above the older white panels. The usual geometric design was enriched with birds in the center. It includes the names of the signs of the zodiac and important figures from the Jewish past but not their images suggesting that it served a rather conservative community.\n\nThe ban on figurative depiction was not taken so seriously by the Jews living in Byzantine [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. In 1966 remains of a synagogue were found in the ancient harbour area. Its mosaic floor depicts [[King David]] as [[Orpheus]], identified by his name in Hebrew letters. Near him were lion cubs, a giraffe and a snake listening to him playing a lyre. A further portion of the floor was divided by medallions formed by vine leaves, each of which contains an animal: a lioness suckling her cub, a giraffe, peacocks, panthers, bears, a zebra and so on. The floor was paved in 508/509. It is very similar to that of the synagogue at Maon (Menois) and the Christian church at [[Shellal (Palestine)|Shellal]], suggesting that the same artist most probably worked at all three places.\n\nThe House of Leontius in [[Bet She'an]] (excavated in 1964\u201372) is a rare example of a synagogue which was part of an inn. It was built in the Byzantine period. The colorful mosaic floor of the synagogue room had an outer stripe decorated with flowers and birds, around medallions with animals, created by [[vine trellises]] emerging from an amphora. The central medallion enclosed a menorah (candelabrum) beneath the word shalom (peace).\n\nA 5th-century building in [[Huldah]] may be a [[Samaritan]] synagogue. Its mosaic floor contains typical Jewish symbols (menorah, lulav, etrog) but the inscriptions are Greek. Another Samaritan synagogue with a mosaic floor was located in Bet She'an (excavated in 1960). The floor had only decorative motifs and an aedicule (shrine) with cultic symbols. The ban on human or animal images was more strictly observed by the Samaritans than their Jewish neighbours in the same town (see above). The mosaic was laid by the same masters who made the floor of the Beit Alfa synagogue. One of the inscriptions was written in Samaritan script.\n\nIn 2003, a synagogue of the 5th or 6th century was uncovered in the coastal Ionian town of [[Saranda]], [[Albania]]. It had exceptional mosaics depicting items associated with Jewish holidays, including a menorah, ram's horn, and lemon tree. Mosaics in the basilica of the synagogue show the facade of what resembles a [[Torah]], animals, trees, and other biblical symbols. The structure measures 20 by 24 m. and was probably last used in the 6th century as a church.\n\n===Middle Eastern and Western Asian art ===\n\n====Pre-Islamic Arabia====\nIn South Arabia two mosaic works were excavated in a Qatabanian from the late 3rd century, those two plates formed geometric and grapevines formation reflecting the traditions of that culture. In the [[Ghassanid]] era religious mosaic art flourished in their territory, so far five churches with mosaic were recorded from that era, two built by Ghassanid rulers and the other three by the Christian Arab community who wrote their names and dedications.\n\n[[File:Bishapur zan.jpg|thumb|upright|Floor pavement representing female dancers, Shapur palace, [[Bishapur]]]]\n\n====Pre-Islamic Persia====\nTilework had been known there for about two thousand years when cultural exchange between [[Sassanid Empire]] and Romans influenced [[Persian people|Persian]] artists to create mosaic patterns. [[Shapur I]] decorated his palace with tile compositions depicting dancers, musicians, courtesans, etc. This was the only significant example of [[figurative art|figurative]] Persian mosaic, which became prohibited after [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Arab conquest]] and arrival of [[Islam]].\n\n====Islamic art====\n{{main article|Islamic art}}\n<!--[[File:Isfahan Lotfollah mosque ceiling symmetric.jpg|thumb|right|Mosaic with a network of lemon-shaped compartments, which increase in size as they descend from a formalised peacock at the pattern inlaid on plain stucco.

In [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]] the Arabs were influenced by the great tradition of Roman and Early Christian mosaic art. During the [[Umayyad Dynasty]] mosaic making remained a flourishing art form in Islamic culture and it is continued in the art of [[zellige]] and [[azulejo]] in various parts of the Arab world, although [[tile]] was to become the main Islamic form of wall decoration.\n\nThe first great religious building of [[Islam]], the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]], which was built between 688\u2013692, was decorated with glass mosaics both inside and outside, by craftsmen of the Byzantine tradition. Only parts of the original interior decoration survive. The rich floral motifs follow Byzantine traditions, and are \"Islamic only in the sense that the vocabulary is syncretic and does not include representation of men or animals.\"<ref>[http://www.sacredsites.com/middle_east/israel/jerusalem.html Jerusalem, Israel]. sacredsites.com. Retrieved on 12 April 2008.</ref>\n\n[[File:Arabischer Mosaizist um 735 001.jpg|thumb|The Umayyad mosaics of [[Hisham's Palace]] closely followed classical traditions]]\nThe most important early Islamic mosaic work is the decoration of the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]], then capital of the [[Arab Caliphate]]. The mosque was built between 706 and 715. The caliph obtained 200 skilled workers from the Byzantine Emperor to decorate the building. This is evidenced by the partly Byzantine style of the decoration. The mosaics of the inner courtyard depict Paradise with beautiful trees, flowers and small hill towns and villages in the background. The mosaics include no human figures, which makes them different from the otherwise similar contemporary Byzantine works. The biggest continuous section survives under the western arcade of the courtyard, called the \"Barada Panel\" after the river [[Barada]]. It is thought that the mosque used to have the largest gold mosaic in the world, at over 4 m<sup>2</sup>. In 1893 a fire damaged the mosque extensively, and many mosaics were lost, although some have been restored since.\n\nThe mosaics of the Umayyad Mosque gave inspiration to later Damascene mosaic works. The Dome of the Treasury, which stands in the mosque courtyard, is covered with fine mosaics, probably dating from 13th- or 14th-century restoration work. The style of them are strikingly similar to the Barada Panel. The mausoleum of Sultan [[Baibars]], [[Az-Zahiriyah library|Madrassa Zahiriyah]], which was built after 1277, is also decorated with a band of golden floral and architectural mosaics, running around inside the main prayer hall.<ref>[http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=2777 Zahiriyya Madrasa and Mausoleum of Sultan al-Zahir Baybars]</ref>\n\nNon-religious Umayyad mosaic works were mainly floor panels which decorated the palaces of the caliphs and other high-ranking officials. They were closely modeled after the mosaics of the Roman country villas, once common in the Eastern Mediterranean. The most superb example can be found in the bath house of [[Hisham's Palace]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] which was made around 744. The main panel depicts a large tree and underneath it a lion attacking a deer (right side) and two deers peacefully grazing (left side). The panel probably represents good and bad governance. Mosaics with classical geometric motifs survived in the bath area of the 8th-century Umayyad palace complex in [[Anjar, Lebanon|Anjar]], [[Lebanon]]. The luxurious desert residence of [[Al-Walid II]] in [[Qasr al-Hallabat]] (in present-day [[Jordan]]) was also decorated with floor mosaics that show a high level of technical skill. The best preserved panel at Hallabat is divided by a Tree of Life flanked by \"good\" animals on one side and \"bad\" animals on the other. Among the Hallabat representations are vine scrolls, grapes, pomegranates, oryx, wolves, hares, a leopard, pairs of partridges, fish, bulls, ostriches, rabbits, rams, goats, lions and a snake. At [[Qastal, Jordan|Qastal]], near [[Amman]], excavations in 2000 uncovered the earliest known Umayyad mosaics in present-day [[Jordan]], dating probably from the caliphate of [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] (685\u2013705). They cover much of the floor of a finely decorated building that probably served as the palace of a local governor. The Qastal mosaics depict geometrical patterns, trees, animals, fruits and rosettes. Except for the open courtyard, entrance and staircases, the floors of the entire palace were covered in mosaics.<ref>[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198701/mosaic.country.htm Saudi Aramco World : Mosaic Country]</ref>\n\n[[File:Cordoba moschee innen5 dome.jpg|thumb|right|Golden mosaics in the dome of the [[Mezquita de C\u00f3rdoba|Great Mosque]] in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|Corduba]], Moorish Spain (965\u2013970)]]\n\nSome of the best examples of later Islamic mosaics were produced in [[Moorish]] [[Spain]]. The golden mosaics in the [[mihrab]] and the central dome of the [[Mezquita de C\u00f3rdoba|Great Mosque]] in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|Corduba]] have a decidedly Byzantine character. They were made between 965 and 970 by local craftsmen, supervised by a master mosaicist from [[Constantinople]], who was sent by the Byzantine Emperor to the Umayyad Caliph of Spain. The decoration is composed of colorful floral [[arabesques]] and wide bands of Arab [[calligraphy]]. The mosaics were purported to evoke the glamour of the Great Mosque in Damascus, which was lost for the Umayyad family.<ref>Marianne Barrucand \u2013 Achim Bednorz: Moorish Architecture in Andalusia, Taschen, 2002, p. 84</ref>\n\nMosaics generally went out of fashion in the Islamic world after the 8th century. Similar effects were achieved by the use of painted tilework, either geometric with small tiles, sometimes called mosaic, like the [[zillij]] of [[North Africa]], or larger tiles painted with parts of a large decorative scheme ([[Qashani]]) in Persia, Turkey and further east.\n\n==Modern mosaics==\n[[File:DryStoneArt.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Mosaic embedded in stone wall, Italian area of Switzerland]]\n[[File:Marcelo de Melo Running Rug.jpg|thumb|''Running Rug'', 2001 \u2013 structural mosaic work by [[Marcelo de Melo]]]]\nNoted 19th-century mosaics include those by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] at St Pauls within the Walls in [[Rome]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/bj/mosaic/index.html |title=Photos of Burne-Jones mosaics in Rome at The Victorian Web |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Another modern mosaic of note is the world's largest mosaic installation located at the [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis]], located in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://explorestlouis.com/visit-explore/discover/25-things-to-do-in-st-louis/|title=25 Things to Do in St. Louis|author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 February 2012}}</ref> A modern example of mosaic is the [[81st Street \u2013 Museum of Natural History (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Museum of Natural History]] station of the [[New York City Subway]] (there are many [[New York City Subway tiles|such works of art]] scattered throughout the New York City subway system, though many [[Independent Subway System|IND]] stations are usually designed with bland mosaics.) Another example of mosaics in ordinary surroundings is the use of locally themed mosaics in some restrooms in the [[rest area]]s along some Texas interstate highways.\n\nSome modern mosaics are the work of ''[[modernisme]]'' style architects [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]] and [[Josep Maria Jujol]], for example the mosaics in the [[Park G\u00fcell]] in [[Barcelona]]. Today, among the leading figures of the mosaic world are [[Emma Biggs]] (UK), [[Marcelo de Melo]] (Brazil), [[Sonia King]] (USA) and [[Saimir Strati]] (Albania).\n\n===Mosaics as a popular craft===\n[[File:Bottlecap mosaic.jpg|thumb|upright|A detail of mosaic mural made of modern bottle screw tops.

The most prominent artist working with mosaics in street art is the French [[Invader (artist)|Invader]]. He has done almost all his work in two very distinct mosaic styles, the first of which are small \"traditional\" tile mosaics of 8 bit video game character, installed in cities across the globe, and the second of which are a style he refers to as \"Rubikcubism\", which uses a kind of dual layer mosaic via grids of scrambled Rubik's Cubes.

Most commonly taking the form of geometric patterns from the simple to the complex, it also is used to create complex pictorial mosaics in styles ranging from iconography to classicism and even modern design. In Portuguese-speaking countries, many cities have a large amount of their sidewalks and even, though far more occasionally, streets done in this mosaic form. [[Lisbon]] in particular maintains almost all walkways in this style.<ref>{{cite web |title=Portuguese Pavements A Cal\u00e7ada Portuguesa |url=http://www.lisbonlux.com/culture/calcada-portuguesa.html |publisher=Lisbon Lux |accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mosaic art at Bonifacio High Street.jpg|thumb|Mosaic art at [[Bonifacio High Street]] in [[Bonifacio Global City]], [[Philippines]]]]\nDespite its prevalence and popularity throughout Portugal and its former colonies, and its relation to older art and architectural styles like [[Azulejo]], Portuguese and Spanish painted tilework, it is a relatively young mosaic artform, its first definitive appearance in a modernly recognizable form being in the mid-1800s.

[[:en:National Gallery of Victoria|National Gallery of Victoria]] (NGV), [[:en:Australia|Australia]]]]\nMosaic is an art form which uses small pieces of materials placed together to create a unified whole. The materials commonly used are marble or other stone, glass, [[pottery]], mirror or foil-backed glass, or shells.\n\nThe word ''mosaic'' is from the Italian ''mosaico'' deriving from the Latin ''mosaicus'' and ultimately from the Greek ''mouseios'' meaning ''belonging to the [[Muses]]'', hence artistic. Each piece of material is a [[Tessera]] (plural: ''tesserae''). The space in between where the grout goes is an interstice. [[Andamento]] is the word used to describe the movement and flow of [[Tesserae]]. The 'opus', the Latin for \u2018work\u2019, is the way in which the pieces are cut and placed.\n\nCommon techniques include:\n* [[Opus regulatum]]: A grid; all tesserae align both vertically and horizontally.\n* [[Opus tessellatum]]: Tesserae form vertical or horizontal rows, but not both.\n* [[Opus vermiculatum]]: One or more lines of tesserae follow the edge of a special shape (letters or a major central graphic).\n* [[Opus musivum]]: Vermiculatum extends throughout the entire background.\n* [[Opus palladianum]]: Instead of forming rows, tesserae are irregularly shaped.  Also known as \"crazy paving\".\n* [[Opus sectile]]: A major shape (e.g. heart, letter, cat) is formed by a single tessera, as later in [[pietra dura]].\n* [[Opus classicum]]: When vermiculatum is combined with tessellatum or regulatum.\n* [[Opus circumactum]]: Tesserae are laid in overlapping semicircles or fan shapes.\n* [[Micromosaic]]: using very small tesserae, in [[Byzantine]] [[icon]]s and Italian panels for jewellery from the Renaissance on.\n\n==Three techniques==\n[[File:Ancient Roman Mosaics Villa Romana La Olmeda 021 Pedrosa De La Vega - Salda\u00f1a (Palencia).JPG|thumb|upright|Tool table for ancient Roman mosaics at Roman villa of [[La Olmeda]] in [[Pedrosa de la Vega]], [[Province of Palencia]] ([[Castile and Le\u00f3n]], [[Spain]]).]][[File:Hammer and hardie.jpg|thumb|These are the hammer and hardie,mosaic tools used for cutting stone by Italian mosaic artists]]\nThere are three main methods: the direct method, the indirect method and the double indirect method.\n\n===Direct method===\n[[File:Li Jiang Guesthouse.jpg|right|thumb|A 'Direct Method' mosaic courtyard made from irregular pebbles and stone strips, [[Lijiang City|Li Jiang]], [[Yunnan]], [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] (China)]]\n\nThe direct method of mosaic construction involves directly placing (gluing) the individual [[tessera]]e onto the supporting surface. This method is well suited to surfaces that have a three-dimensional quality, such as vases.  This was used for the historic European wall and ceiling mosaics, following [[underdrawing]]s of the main outlines on the wall below, which are often revealed again when the mosaic falls away.\n\nThe direct method suits small projects that are transportable. Another advantage of the direct method is that the resulting mosaic is progressively visible, allowing for any adjustments to tile color or placement.\n\nThe disadvantage of the direct method is that the artist must work directly at the chosen surface, which is often not practical for long periods of time, especially for large-scale projects. Also, it is difficult to control the evenness of the finished surface. This is of particular importance when creating a functional surface such as a floor or a table top.\n\nA modern version of the direct method, sometimes called \"double direct,\" is to work directly onto fiberglass mesh. The mosaic can then be constructed with the design visible on the surface and transported to its final location. Large work can be done in this way, with the mosaic being cut up for shipping and then reassembled for installation. It enables the artist to work in comfort in a studio rather than at the site of installation.\n\n===Indirect method===\nThe indirect method of applying tesserae is often used for very large projects, projects with repetitive elements or for areas needing site specific shapes. Tiles are applied face-down to a backing paper using an adhesive, and later transferred onto walls, floors or craft projects. This method is most useful for extremely large projects as it gives the maker time to rework areas, allows the cementing of the tiles to the backing panel to be carried out quickly in one operation and helps ensure that the front surfaces of the mosaic tiles and mosaic pieces are flat and in the same plane on the front, even when using tiles and pieces of differing thicknesses. Mosaic murals, benches and tabletops are some of the items usually made using the indirect method, as it results in a smoother and more even surface.\n\n===Double indirect method===\nThe double indirect method can be used when it is important to see the work during the creation process as it will appear when completed. The tesserae are placed face-up on a medium (often adhesive-backed paper, sticky plastic or soft lime or putty) as it will appear when installed. When the mosaic is complete, a similar medium is placed atop it. The piece is then turned over, the original underlying material is carefully removed, and the piece is installed as in the indirect method described above. In comparison to the indirect method, this is a complex system to use and requires great skill on the part of the operator, to avoid damaging the work. Its greatest advantage lies in the possibility of the operator directly controlling the final result of the work, which is important e.g. when the human figure is involved.\nThis method was created in 1989 by Maurizio Placuzzi and registered for industrial use (patent n. [http://www.uibm.gov.it/uibm/dati/Codice.aspx?load=info_list_uno&id=127474&table=UtilityModel 0000222556]) under the name of his company, Sicis International Srl, now Sicis The Art Mosaic Factory Srl.\n\n==Mathematics==\n{{further information|tessellation|mathematics and art}}\n\nThe best way to arrange variously shaped tiles on a surface leads to the mathematical field of [[tessellation]].<ref>{{cite book | ref=harv | authorlink=H.S.M.

C. Escher]] was influenced by Moorish mosaics to begin his investigations into tessellation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Roza |first=Greg |title=An Optical Artist: Exploring Patterns and Symmetry |year=2005 |publisher=Rosen Classroom |isbn=978-1-4042-5117-5 |page=20}}</ref> <!--should also discuss [[Girih tiles]] here-->\n\n==Digital imaging==\nA mosaic in [[digital imaging]] is a plurality of non-overlapping images, arranged in some [[tessellation]]. A [[photomosaic]] is a picture made up of various other pictures (pioneered by Joseph Francis), in which each \"[[pixel]]\" is another picture, when examined closely. This form has been adopted in many modern media and digital [[image search]]es.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thudit.com/ |title= Search Pictures In Mosaic Format |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nA tile mosaic is a [[digital image]] made up of individual [[tile]]s, arranged in a non-overlapping fashion, e.g. to make a static image on a shower room or bathing pool floor, by breaking the image down into square pixels formed from ceramic tiles (a typical size is {{convert|1|x|1|in|mm|abbr=on}}, as for example, on the floor of the [[University of Toronto]] pool, though sometimes larger tiles such as {{convert|2|x|2|in|mm|abbr=on}} are used). These digital images are coarse in resolution and often simply express text, such as the depth of the pool in various places, but some such digital images are used to show a sunset or other beach theme.\n\nRecent developments in digital image processing have led to the ability to design physical tile mosaics using [[computer aided design]] (CAD) software. The software typically takes as inputs a source [[bitmap]] and a [[Palette (computing)|palette]] of colored tiles.  The software makes a [[best-fit]] match of the tiles to the source image.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Robotic manufacturing==\nWith high cost of labor in developed countries, production [[automation]] has become increasingly popular. Rather than being assembled by hand, mosaics designed using [[computer aided design]] (CAD) software can be assembled by a robot. Production can be greater than 10 times faster with higher accuracy.  But these \"computer\" mosaics have a different look than hand-made \"artisanal\" mosaics.  With robotic production, colored tiles are loaded into [[wikt:buffer|buffers]], and then the robot picks and places tiles individually according to a command file from the design software.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artaic.com/ |title=Automated Custom Mosaics |year=2011 |accessdate=25 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pixel art]]\n* [[Terrazzo]]\n* [[International Association of Marble, Slate and Stone Polishers, Rubbers and Sawyers, Tile and Marble Setters' Helpers and Marble Mosaic and Terrazzo Workers' Helpers]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|28em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n* {{cite book |last=Dunbabin | first=Katherine M.
