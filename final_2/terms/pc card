Originally introduced as '''PCMCIA''', the PC Card standard as well as its successors like CardBus were defined and developed by the ''Personal Computer Memory Card International Association'' (PCMCIA).\n\nIt was originally designed as a standard for memory-[[expansion card]]s for [[computer storage]]. The existence of a usable general standard for notebook peripherals led to many kinds of devices being made available based on its configurability, including [[network card]]s, [[modem]]s, and [[hard disk]]s.\n\n==History==\nThe PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) industry organization was based on the original initiative of the British mathematician and computer scientist [[Ian Cullimore]],<ref name=\"Strass_1994_PCMCIA\">{{Cite book|title=PCMCIA optimal nutzen|trans_title=Using PCMCIA optimally|first=Hermann|last=Strass|publisher=Franzis-Verlag GmbH, Poing|date=1994|isbn=3-7723-6652-X|id=9-783772-366529|language=German}}</ref> one of the founders of the [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]]-based [[Poqet Computer Corporation]],<ref name=\"Strass_1994_PCMCIA\"/> who was seeking to integrate some kind of memory card technology as storage medium into their early [[DOS]]-based palmtop PCs,<ref name=\"Strass_1994_PCMCIA\"/> when traditional floppy drives and harddisks were found to be too power-hungry and large to fit into their battery-powered handheld devices.<ref name=\"Strass_1994_PCMCIA\"/> When in July 1989,<ref name=\"Strass_1994_PCMCIA\"/> Poqet contacted [[Fujitsu]] for their existing but still non-standardized [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]] memory cards, and [[Intel]] for their [[flash memory|flash]] technology,<ref name=\"Strass_1994_PCMCIA\"/> the necessity and potential of establishing a worldwide memory card standard became obvious to the parties involved. This led to the foundation of the PCMCIA organization in September 1989.<ref name=\"Strass_1994_PCMCIA\"/><ref name=\"Mielke_1997_PCCard\">{{Cite book|title=PC-Card Anwender-L\u00f6sungen|trans_title=Solutions for PC Card users|first=Bernd|last=Mielke|publisher=Franzis-Verlag GmbH, Feldkirchen|date=1997|isbn=3-7723-4313-9|id=9-783772-343131|language=German}}</ref>\n\nBy early 1990, some thirty companies had joined the initiative already, including Poqet, Fujitsu, Intel, [[Mitsubishi]], [[IBM]], [[Lotus Development Corporation|Lotus]], [[Microsoft]] and <!-- the German -->[[SCM Microsystems]].<ref name=\"Strass_1994_PCMCIA\"/>\n\nThe PCMCIA 1.0 card standard was published in November 1990 and was soon adopted by more than eighty vendors.<ref name=\"Strass_1994_PCMCIA\"/><ref name=\"Mielke_1997_PCCard\"/> It corresponds with the Japanese [[JEIDA memory card]] 4.0 standard.<ref name=\"Mielke_1997_PCCard\"/>\n\nSanDisk (operating at the time as \"SunDisk\") launched its PCMCIA card in October 1992. The company was the first to introduce a writeable Flash RAM card for the HP 95LX (the first MS-DOS pocket computer). These cards conformed to a supplemental PCMCIA-ATA standard that allowed them to appear as more conventional IDE hard drives to the 95LX or a PC. This had the advantage of raising the upper limit on capacity to the full 32M available under DOS 3.22 on the 95LX.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hpmuseum.net/pdf/TheHPPalmtopPaper_V2N1_60pgs_Jan-Feb93_OCR.pdf | title = HP Palmtop Paper}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:IBM PCMCIA Data-Fax Modem V.34 FRU 42H4326-8920.jpg|thumb|right|Type II PC Card: [[IBM]] [[List of ITU-T V-series recommendations#Interfaces and voiceband modems|V.34]] data/fax modem, manufactured by [[TDK]]]]\nIt soon became clear that the '''PCMCIA card''' standard needed expansion to support \"smart\" I/O cards to address the emerging need for fax, modem, LAN, harddisk and floppy disk cards.<ref name=\"Strass_1994_PCMCIA\"/> It also needed interrupt facilities and hot plugging, which required the definition of new BIOS and operating system interfaces.<ref name=\"Strass_1994_PCMCIA\"/> This led to the introduction of release 2.0 of the PCMCIA standard and '''JEIDA 4.1''' in September 1991,<ref name=\"Strass_1994_PCMCIA\"/><ref name=\"Mielke_1997_PCCard\"/> which saw corrections and expansion with Card Services (CS) in the PCMCIA 2.1 standard in November 1992.<ref name=\"Strass_1994_PCMCIA\"/><ref name=\"Mielke_1997_PCCard\"/>\n\nMany notebooks in the 1990s had two adjacent type-II slots, which allowed installation of two type-II cards or one, double-thickness, type-III card. The cards were also used in early digital SLR cameras, such as the [[Kodak DCS 300 series]]. However, their original use as storage expansion is no longer common.\n\nThe PC Card port has been superseded by the [[ExpressCard]] interface since 2003, though some manufacturers such as [[Dell]] continued to offer them into 2012 on their ruggedized '''XFR''' notebooks.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.dell.com/us/enterprise/p/latitude-e6400-xfr/ | publisher = Dell | place = US | title = Enterprise | contribution = Latitude E6400 XFR}}.</ref>\n\n[[Image:pcmcia-type-ii-and-iii.jpg|right|thumb|Two PC Card devices:<br/>[[Xircom]] RealPort (top) type III and <br/>[[3Com]] (bottom) type II.]]\n\n{{As of|2013}}, some vehicles from [[Honda]] equipped with a [[navigation system]], such as the [[Honda Civic]], the [[Honda CR-Z]] the [[Honda Fit]], and the [[Honda Insight]], still include a PC card reader that is integrated into the [[audio system]].\n\nSome Japanese brand [[consumer entertainment device|consumer entertainment devices]] such as TV sets include a PC Card slot for playback of media.<ref>[http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/PUSA/Home/Plasma/PRO-1130HD] Pioneer PRO-1130HD information page, Retrieved 16 January 2016.</ref>\n[[File:Sharp TU-32GAX PC Card Slot.jpg|thumb|A [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] TU-32GAX media receiver with a PC Card slot.]]\n\n==Summary==\n* PC Card = PCMCIA Card (older name): [[16-bit]] or [[32-bit]]\n* PC Card 32-bit version = Cardbus (alternative name)\n* 16-bit vs. 32-bit: 32 bit includes DMA or bus mastering, 16-bit does not\n* Types I\u2013III:\n:Type I: 16-bit.

This acronym was difficult to say and remember, and was sometimes jokingly referred to as ''\"People Can't Memorize Computer Industry Acronyms\"''.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Clark | first1 = Scott H | last2 = Norton | first2 = Peter | title= Peter Norton's new Inside the PC | publisher= SAMS | location= Indianapolis | year = 2002 | page = 33 | isbn= 0-672-32289-7}}</ref> To recognize increased scope beyond memory, and to aid in marketing, the association acquired the rights to the simpler term \"PC Card\" from [[IBM]]. This was the name of the standard from version 2 of the specification onwards. These cards were used for [[Wireless LAN|wireless networks]], [[modem]]s, and other functions in notebook PCs.\n\nThe PCMCIA association was dissolved in 2009 and all of its activities are now managed by the [[USB Implementers Forum|USB Implementer's Forum]], according to the PCMCIA website.<ref>{{Citation | title = Developer | publisher = Express card | url = http://www.expresscard.org/web/site/developer.jsp}}.</ref>\n\n==Card types==\nAll PC Card devices use a similar sized package which is {{convert|85.6|mm}} long and {{convert|54.0|mm}} wide, the same size as a [[credit card]].<ref name= Mueller99>{{cite book| last= Mueller| first= Scott| title= Upgrading and repairing PCs | year =1999|publisher=Que|location=Indianapolis, IN |isbn=0-7897-1903-7|edition= 11th |pages = 1236\u201341}}</ref> The shape is also used by the [[Common Interface]] form of [[conditional-access module]]s for [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB broadcasts]], and by Panasonic for their professional \"P2\" video acquisition memory cards.\n\nThe original standard was defined for both 5&nbsp;[[volt|V]] and 3.3&nbsp;volt cards, with 3.3&nbsp;V cards having a key on the side to prevent them from being inserted fully into a 5 V-only slot. Some cards and some slots operate at both voltages as needed. The original standard was built around an 'enhanced' 16-bit [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] bus platform. A newer version of the PCMCIA standard is CardBus (see below), a 32-bit version of the original standard. In addition to supporting a wider bus of 32 bits (instead of the original 16), CardBus also supports [[bus mastering]] and operation speeds up to 33&nbsp;MHz.\n\n===Type I===\nCards designed to the original specification (PCMCIA 1.0) are type I and feature a 16-bit interface. They are {{convert|3.3|mm}} thick and feature a dual row of 34 holes (68 in total) along a short edge as a connecting interface. Type-I PC Card devices are typically used for memory devices such as [[RAM]], [[flash memory]], [[Programmable read-only memory|OTP (One-Time Programmable)]], and [[Static random access memory|SRAM]] cards.\n\n===Type II===\nType-II and above PC Card devices use two rows of 34 sockets, and feature a 16- or 32-bit interface. They are {{convert|5.0|mm}} thick. Type-II cards introduced I/O support, allowing devices to attach an array of peripherals or to provide connectors/slots to interfaces for which the host computer had no built-in support.\n\nFor example, many modem, network, and TV cards accept this configuration. Due to their thinness, most Type II interface cards feature miniature interface connectors on the card connecting to a [[dongle]], a short cable that adapts from the card's miniature connector to an external full-size connector. Some cards instead have a lump on the end with the connectors. This is more robust and convenient than a separate adapter but can block the other slot where slots are present in a pair. Some Type II cards, most notably network interface and modem cards, have a retractable jack, which can be pushed into the card and will pop out when needed, allowing insertion of a cable from above. When use of the card is no longer needed, the jack can be pushed back into the card and locked in place, protecting it from damage. Most network cards have their jack on one side, while most modems have their jack on the other side, allowing the use of both at the same time as they do not interfere with each other. Wireless Type II cards often had a plastic shroud that jutted out from the end of the card to house the antenna.\n\nIn the mid-90s, PC Card Type II hard disk drive cards have become available; previously, PC Card hard disk drives were only available in Type III.<ref>Infoworld, October 10, 1994, Page 44, \u201cMaxtor drive adds to portable options, MobileMax Lite will ship in \u201895\u201d</ref>\n\n===Type III===\nType-III PC Card devices are 16-bit or 32-bit. These cards are {{convert|10.5|mm}} thick, allowing them to accommodate devices with components that would not fit type I or type II height. Examples are hard disk drive cards,<ref name=Mueller99/> and interface cards with full-size connectors that do not require dongles (as is commonly required with type II interface cards).\n\n===Type IV===\nType-IV cards, introduced by [[Toshiba]], have not been officially standardized or sanctioned by the [[PCMCIA]]. These cards are {{convert|16|mm}} thick.\n\n===CompactFlash===\n[[CompactFlash]] is a smaller dimensioned 50 pin subset of the 68 pin PC Card interface.\nIt requires a setting for the interface mode of either \"memory\" or \"[[AT Attachment|ATA]] storage\".\n\n==Card information structure==\nThe ''card information structure'' (CIS) is information stored on a PC card that contains information about the formatting and organization of the data on the card.<ref>[http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/ftp/doc/PCMCIA-PROG.html Linux PCMCIA Programmer's Guide]</ref>\nThe CIS also contains information such as:\n\n* Type of card\n* Supported power supply options\n* Supported power saving features\n* Manufacturer\n* Model number\n\nWhen a card is unrecognized it is frequently because the CIS information is either lost or damaged.\n\n==CardBus==\n[[Image:Xircom Realport PCMCIA and CardBus notch.jpg|right|thumb|Two Xircom RealPort Ethernet/56k modem cards. Top one is CardBus, and the bottom is the 5 volt PCMCIA version. Note the slightly different notch.]]\nCardBus are PCMCIA 5.0 or later (JEIDA 4.2 or later) 32-bit PCMCIA devices, introduced in 1995 and present in laptops from late 1997 onward. CardBus is effectively a 32-bit, 33&nbsp;MHz [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus in the PC Card design. CardBus supports [[bus mastering]], which allows a controller on the bus to talk to other devices or memory without going through the [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. Many chipsets, such as those that support [[Wi-Fi]], are available for both [[Conventional PCI|PCI]] and CardBus.\n\nThe notch on the left hand front of the device is slightly shallower on a CardBus device so, by design, a 32-bit device cannot be plugged into earlier equipment supporting only 16-bit devices.  Most new slots accept both CardBus and the original 16-bit PC Card devices. CardBus cards can be distinguished from older cards by the presence of a gold band with eight small studs on the top of the card next to the pin sockets.\n\nThe speed of CardBus interfaces in 32-bit [[Burst mode (computing)|burst mode]] depends on the transfer type: in byte mode, transfer is 33&nbsp;MB/s; in word mode it is 66&nbsp;MB/s; and in dword (double-word) mode 132&nbsp;MB/s.\n\n==CardBay==\nCardBay is a variant added to the PCMCIA specification introduced in 2001.  It was intended to add some forward compatibility with [[USB]] and [[IEEE 1394]], but was not universally adopted and only some notebooks have PC Card controllers with CardBay features. This is an implementation of Microsoft and Intel's joint [[Drive Bay]] initiative.\n\n==Descendants and variants==\nThe interface has spawned a generation of flash memory cards that set out to improve on the size and features of Type I cards: [[CompactFlash]], [[Miniature Card|MiniCard]], [[P2 (storage media)|P2 Card]] and [[SmartMedia]]. For example, the PC Card electrical specification is also used for [[CompactFlash]], so a PC Card CompactFlash adapter need only be a socket adapter.\n\n'''[[ExpressCard]]''' is a later specification from the PCMCIA, intended as a replacement for PC Card, built around the [[PCI Express]] and [[USB 2.0]] standards.  The PC Card standard is closed to further development and PCMCIA strongly encourages future product designs to utilize the ExpressCard interface. From about 2006 ExpressCard slots replaced PCMCIA slots in laptop computers, with a few laptops having both in the transition period. Much expansion that formerly required a PCMCIA card is catered for by [[USB]], reducing the requirement for internal [[expansion slot]]s; by 2011 many laptops had none.\n\nExpressCard and CardBus sockets are physically and electrically incompatible.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pcmcia.org/faq.htm#expresscard | title = PCMCIA Frequently Asked Questions}}</ref> ExpressCard-to-CardBus and Cardbus-to-ExpressCard adapters are available that connect a Cardbus card to an Expresscard slot, or vice versa, and carry out the required electrical interfacing.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&DEPA=0&Order=BESTMATCH&Description=cardbus+expresscard&x=12&y=30 | title = Newegg.com product search results for CardBus ExpressCard}}</ref> These adapters do not handle older non-Cardbus PCMCIA cards.\n\nAdapters for PC Cards to Personal Computer ISA slots were available when these technologies were current. Cardbus adapters for PCI slots have been made. These adapters were sometimes used to fit Wireless (802.11) PCMCIA cards into desktop computers with PCI slots.<ref>http://homecommunity.cisco.com/t5/Wireless-Adapters/PCI-SLOT/m-p/58789</ref>\n\nSome IBM Thinkpad laptops took their onboard ram (in sizes ranging from 4-16M in the factor of a DRAM Card. While very similar in form-factor, these cards did not go into a standard PC Card Slot, often being installed under the keyboard, for example.  They also were not pin-compatible, as they had 88 pins but in two staggered rows, as opposed to even rows like PC Cards.<ref>http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/IC_DRAM_Card</ref>\n\n==Technological obsolescence==\nPCMCIA is mostly no longer used for laptops (or elsewhere), nor is its successor. Now mostly used are external devices instead of these internal cards, such as connected by [[USB]], that use [[serial communication]], or in rare cases PC Card's successor ExpressCard (also serial, while the parallel form of communication is much less used than previously for most standards, with the PC Card about the last holdout).\n\n[[USB]] devices are available for almost all functions the PC Card originally provided. The [[ExpressCard]], which replaced the PC Card, contains a PCIe 1x and a [[USB]] interface. Cardbus devices can be plugged into an ExpressCard adaptor having a PCI-to-PCIe Bridge.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Conditional-access module]] (CAM)\n* [[ExpressCard]]\n* [[List of device bandwidths]]\n* [[USB]] for [[mobile modem]]s\n* [[XJACK]]\n* [[Zoomed video port]]\n* [[CableCARD]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|PC cards}}\n* [http://www.hpcfactor.com/support/cesd/h/0037.asp Understanding PC Card, PCMCIA, Cardbus, 16-bit, 32-bit.]\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822091330/http://www.pcmcia.org/ |date=August 22, 2008 |title=PCMCIA official website }}\n* [http://pcmcia-cs.sf.net/ Linux PCMCIA Information Page (kernel 2.4 and earlier)]\n* [http://kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/pcmcia/pcmcia.html Linux Kernel 2.6 PCMCIA]\n* [http://tuxmobil.org/pcmcia_linux.html PCMCIA/CardBus Linux Status Survey]\n* [http://pinouts.ws/pcmcia-pinout.html PCMCIA pinout]\n* [http://pinouts.ru/Slots/PcCard_pinout.shtml PCMCIA (PC Card) pinout and signals]\n* [http://www.sycard.com/pcard_qa.html Simple FAQ on PCMCIA & PC Card]\n* [https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/arch-handbook/pccard.html PC Card on FreeBSD]\n* [https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pccard&sektion=4&manpath=FreeBSD+10.3-RELEASE+and+Ports pccard(4) - FreeBSD manpage]\n* [http://bxr.su/FreeBSD/sys/dev/pccard/ pccard(4) - FreeBSD implementation]\n\n{{memory cards}}\n{{computer bus}}\n\n[[Category:Solid-state computer storage media]]\n[[Category:Motherboard]]\n[[Category:PCMCIA]]\n[[Category:Standards organizations]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 1990]]"}]}}}}
