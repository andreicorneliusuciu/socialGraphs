Each of these inventions is essentially consistent with the modern definition of engineering.\n\nThe term ''engineering''  is derived from the word ''engineer'', which itself dates back to 1390, when an ''engine'er'' (literally, one who operates an ''engine'') originally referred to \"a constructor of military engines.\"<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''</ref> In this context, now obsolete, an \"engine\" referred to a military machine, ''i.e.'', a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a [[catapult]]). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps, ''e.g.'', the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]].\n\nThe word \"engine\" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the [[Latin]] ''ingenium'' (c. 1250), meaning \"innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention.\"<ref>Origin: 1250\u20131300; ME engin < AF, OF < L ingenium nature, innate quality, esp. mental power, hence a clever invention, equiv. to in- + -genium, equiv. to gen- begetting; Source: Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House, Inc. 2006.</ref>\n\nLater, as the design of civilian structures such as bridges and buildings matured as a technical discipline, the term [[civil engineering]]<ref name=\"ECPD Definition on Britannica\"/> entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the older discipline of [[military engineering]].\n\n===Ancient era===\n[[File:Pont du gard.jpg|thumb|The Ancient Romans built [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] to bring a steady supply of clean fresh water to cities and towns in the empire.]]\nThe [[Pharos of Alexandria]], the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] in [[Egypt]], the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]], the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] and the [[Parthenon]] in [[Greece]], the [[Roman aqueduct]]s, [[Via Appia]] and the [[Colosseum]], [[Teotihuac\u00e1n]] and the cities and pyramids of the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]], [[Inca]] and [[Aztec]] Empires, the [[Great Wall of China]], the [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]] of [[Thanjavur]] and [[Indian Temples]], among many others, stand as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of the ancient civil and military engineers.\n\nThe earliest civil engineer known by name is [[Imhotep]].<ref name=\"ECPD Definition on Britannica\"/> As one of the officials of the [[Pharaoh]], [[Djoser|Djos\u00e8r]], he probably designed and supervised the construction of the [[Pyramid of Djoser]] (the [[Step Pyramid]]) at [[Saqqara]] in [[History of ancient Egypt|Egypt]] around [[27th century BC|2630]]\u2013[[27th century BC|2611 BC]].<ref name=\"Barry\">Barry J.

Smeaton designed the third [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] (1755\u201359) where he pioneered the use of '[[hydraulic lime]]' (a form of [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] which will set under water) and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse. His lighthouse remained in use until 1877 and was dismantled and partially rebuilt at [[Plymouth Hoe]] where it is known as [[Smeaton's Tower]]. He is important in the history, rediscovery of, and development of modern [[cement]], because he identified the compositional requirements needed to obtain \"hydraulicity\" in lime; work which led ultimately to the invention of [[Portland cement]].\n\nThe United States census of 1850 listed the occupation of \"engineer\" for the first time with a count of 2,000.<ref>{{Citation |last=Cowan |first=Ruth Schwartz |title=A Social History of American Technology |publisher=Oxford University Press |place=New York |year=1997 |isbn=0-19-504605-6|page=138}}</ref>  There were fewer than 50 engineering graduates in the U.S. before 1865.

These disciplines concern themselves with differing areas of engineering work. Although initially an engineer will usually be trained in a specific discipline, throughout an engineer's career the engineer may become multi-disciplined, having worked in several of the outlined areas.

These and other branches of engineering are represented in the 36 Licensed Member institutions of the UK [[Engineering Council]].\n\nNew specialties sometimes combine with the traditional fields and form new branches \u2013 for example [[Earth Systems Engineering and Management]] involves a wide range of subject areas including [[anthropology]], [[engineering studies]], [[environmental science]], [[ethics]] and [[philosophy]]. A new or emerging area of application will commonly be defined temporarily as a permutation or subset of existing disciplines; there is often gray area as to when a given sub-field warrants classification as a new \"branch.\" One key indicator of such emergence is when major universities start establishing departments and programs in the new field.\n\nFor each of these fields there exists considerable overlap, especially in the areas of the application of fundamental sciences to their disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and mathematics.\nAs a result, there are many different types of engineering degrees available. In the past, engineering could be divided into four major branches: Mechanical, Chemical, Civil and Electrical, with sub branches of each discipline. Today however, the number of engineering degrees available have increased dramatically.\n\n==Practice==\nOne who practices engineering is called an [[engineer]], and those licensed to do so may have more formal designations such as [[Professional Engineer]],  [[Chartered Engineer]], [[Incorporated Engineer]], [[Ingenieur]], [[European Engineer]], or [[Federal Aviation Administration#Designated Engineering Representative (DER)|Designated Engineering Representative]].  In the UK many trades are called \"Engineer\" including gas, telephone, photocopy, maintenance, plumber-heating, drainage, sanitary, auto mechanic, TV, Refrigerator, electrician, washing machine, TV antenna installer (satellite) and many others.\n\n==Methodology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Dampfturbine Montage01.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Design of a [[turbine]] requires collaboration of engineers from many fields, as the system involves mechanical, electro-magnetic and chemical processes. The [[turbine blade|blades]], [[stator|rotor and stator]] as well as the [[steam cycle]] all need to be carefully designed and optimized.]]\n\nEngineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find suitable solutions to problems or to make improvements to the status quo. More than ever, engineers are now required to have knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects. As a result, they keep on learning new material throughout their career.\n\nIf multiple options exist, engineers weigh different design choices on their merits and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. The crucial and unique task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to produce a successful result. It is usually not enough to build a technically successful product; it must also meet further requirements.\n\nConstraints may include available resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, [[Safety engineering|safety]], marketability, productivity, and [[Serviceability (computer)|serviceability]]. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive [[specifications]] for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated.\n\nA general methodology and epistemology of engineering can be inferred from the historical case studies and comments provided by Walter Vincenti.<ref>Vincenti, Walter G. (1993-02-01). What Engineers Know and How They Know It: Analytical Studies from Aeronautical History. The Johns Hopkins University Press. ISBN 0-8018-4588-2.</ref> Though Vincenti's case studies are from the domain of aeronautical engineering, his conclusions can be transferred into many other branches of engineering, too.\n\nAccording to Billy Vaughn Koen, the \"''engineering method'' is the use of heuristics to cause the best change in a poorly understood situation within the available resources.\" Koen argues that the definition of what makes one an engineer should not be based on what he produces, but rather how he goes about it.<ref name=\"Discussion of The Method\">{{cite book|last1=Koen|first1=Billy Vaughn|title=Discussion of The Method|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York Oxford|isbn=0-19-515599-8|page=8|edition=1|url=https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/discussion-of-the-method-9780195155990|accessdate=23 July 2015|ref=5}}</ref>\n\n===Problem solving===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Booster-Layout.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A drawing for a booster engine for [[steam locomotive]]s. Engineering is applied to [[design]], with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science.]]\nEngineers use their knowledge of [[science]], [[mathematics]], [[logic]], [[economics]], and [[empirical knowledge|appropriate experience]] or [[tacit knowledge]] to find suitable solutions to a problem.  Creating an appropriate [[mathematical model]] of a problem allows them to analyze it (sometimes definitively), and to test potential solutions.\n\nUsually multiple reasonable solutions exist, so engineers must evaluate the different [[design choice]]s on their merits and choose the solution that best meets their requirements.  [[Genrich Altshuller]], after gathering statistics on a large number of [[patent]]s, suggested that [[compromise]]s are at the heart of \"[[level of invention|low-level]]\" engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem.\n\nEngineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: [[prototype]]s, [[scale model]]s, [[simulation]]s, [[destructive testing|destructive tests]], [[nondestructive testing|nondestructive tests]], and [[stress testing|stress tests]]. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected.\n\nEngineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large. Engineers typically include a [[factor of safety]] in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure. However, the greater the safety factor, the less efficient the design may be.\n\nThe study of failed products is known as [[forensic engineering]], and can help the [[product design]]er in evaluating his or her design in the light of real conditions. The discipline is of greatest value after disasters, such as [[bridge collapse]]s, when careful analysis is needed to establish the cause or causes of the failure.\n\n===Computer use===\n[[File:CFD Shuttle.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around a [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] during re-entry. Solutions to the flow require [[Finite element method|modelling]] of the combined effects of [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations|fluid flow]] and the [[heat equation]]s.]]\n\nAs with all modern scientific and technological endeavors, computers and software play an increasingly important role. As well as the typical business [[application software]] there are a number of computer aided applications ([[computer-aided technologies]]) specifically for engineering. Computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes, which can be solved using [[numerical method]]s.\n\nOne of the most widely used [[design tool]]s in the profession is [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software like [[CATIA]], [[Autodesk Inventor]], DSS [[SolidWorks]] or [[Pro Engineer]] which enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with [[digital mockup]] (DMU) and [[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]] software such as [[Finite element method|finite element method analysis]] or [[analytic element method]] allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.\n\nThese allow products and components to be checked for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and kinematics. Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of [[product data management]] software.<ref>\n {{cite web\n  | last = Arbe\n  | first = Katrina\n  | title = PDM: Not Just for the Big Boys Anymore\n  | publisher = ThomasNet\n  | date = 2001-05-07\n  | url = http://news.thomasnet.com/IMT/archives/2001/05/pdm_not_just_fo.html\n  | accessdate = 2006-12-30\n}}</ref>\n\nThere are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) software to generate [[CNC]] machining instructions; [[manufacturing process management]] software for production engineering; [[Electronic design automation|EDA]] for [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) and circuit [[schematic]]s for electronic engineers; [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|MRO]] applications for maintenance management; and [[Architecture, engineering and construction|AEC]] software for civil engineering.\n\nIn recent years the use of computer software to aid the development of goods has collectively come to be known as [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM).<ref>\n {{cite web\n  | last = Arbe\n  | first = Katrina\n  | title = The Latest Chapter in CAD Software Evaluation\n  | publisher = ThomasNet\n  | date = 2003-05-22\n  | url = http://news.thomasnet.com/IMT/archives/2003/05/the_latest_chap.html\n  | accessdate = 2006-12-30\n\n}}</ref>\n\n==Social context==\n{{Original research section|date=July 2010}}\n[[File:Kismet robot 20051016.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Robotic]] [[Kismet (robot)|Kismet]] can produce a range of facial expressions.]]\nThe engineering profession engages in a wide range of activities, from large collaboration at the societal level, and also smaller individual projects.  Almost all engineering projects are obligated to some sort of financing agency: a company, a set of investors, or a government.  The few types of engineering that are minimally constrained by such issues are ''[[pro bono]]'' engineering and [[open design|open-design]] engineering.\n\nBy its very nature engineering has interconnections with society, culture and human behavior.  Every product or construction used by modern society is influenced by engineering. The results of engineering activity influence changes to the environment, society and economies, and its application brings with it a responsibility and public safety.  Many [[Engineering society|engineering societies]] have established codes of practice and [[engineering ethics|codes of ethics]] to guide members and inform the public at large.\n\nEngineering projects can be subject to controversy.

Both areas of endeavor rely on accurate observation of materials and phenomena.  Both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and communicate observations.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nScientists may also have to complete engineering tasks, such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes. Conversely, in the process of developing technology engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena, thus becoming, for the moment, scientists or more precisely \"engineering scientists\".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn the book ''[[What Engineers Know and How They Know It]]'',<ref name=\"vincenti\">{{cite book|last=Vincenti|first=Walter G. |title=What Engineers Know and How They Know It: Analytical Studies from Aeronautical History|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1993|isbn=0-8018-3974-2}}</ref> Walter Vincenti asserts that engineering research has a character different from that of scientific research.  First, it often deals with areas in which the basic [[physics]] or [[chemistry]] are well understood, but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner.\n\n[[File:Expedition 36 flight engineer Chris Cassidy.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Christopher Cassidy]] of [[NASA]] works on the Capillary Flow Experiment aboard the [[International Space Station]].]]\n\nExamples are the use of numerical approximations to the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]] to describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft, or the use of [[Fatigue (material)|Miner's rule]] to calculate fatigue damage. Second, engineering research employs many semi-[[empirical methods]] that are foreign to pure scientific research, one example being the method of parameter variation.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nAs stated by Fung ''et al.'' in the revision to the classic engineering text ''Foundations of Solid Mechanics'':\n\n<blockquote>Engineering is quite different from science. Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature. Engineers stress innovation and invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people can use. That something can be a complex system, device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what already exists. Since a design has to be realistic and functional, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristics data defined.  In the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions. Most often, they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and mechanics. Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession. Thus engineering sciences were born.<ref name=\"Fung\">{{cite book|title=Classical and Computational Solid Mechanics, YC Fung and P. Tong|publisher=World Scientific|year=2001}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough engineering solutions make use of scientific principles, engineers must also take into account safety, efficiency, economy, reliability and constructability or ease of fabrication as well as the environment, ethical and legal considerations such as patent infringement or liability in the case of failure of the solution.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n===Medicine and biology===\n[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - presumed self-portrait - WGA12798.jpg|thumb|225px|left|[[Leonardo da Vinci]], seen here in a self-portrait, has been described as the epitome of the artist/engineer.<ref name=\"Bjerklie, David\"/> He is also known for his studies on [[human anatomy]] and [[physiology]].]]\n\nThe study of the human body, albeit from different directions and for different purposes, is an important common link between medicine and some engineering disciplines.

[[Engineering management]] is a specialized field of management concerned with the engineering sector.  The demand for management-focused engineers (or from the opposite perspective, managers with an understanding of engineering), has resulted in the development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles. During an engineering management course, students will develop [[industrial engineering]] skills, knowledge and expertise, alongside knowledge of business administration, management techniques, and strategic thinking.  Engineers specializing in change management must have in depth knowledge of the application of [[industrial and organizational psychology]] principles and methods.  Professional engineers often train as [[certified management consultant]]s in the very specialized field of [[management consulting]] applied to the engineering sector.  This work often deals with large scale complex [[business transformation]] or [[Business process management]] initiatives in aerospace and defence, automotive, oil and gas, machinery, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, electrical & electronics, power distribution & generation, utilities and transportation systems.  This combination of technical engineering practice, management consulting practice, industry sector knowledge, and change management expertise enables professional engineers who are also qualified as management consultants to lead major business transformation initiatives. These initiatives are typically sponsored by C-level executives.\n\n===Other fields===\nIn [[political science]], the term ''engineering'' has been borrowed for the study of the subjects of [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] and [[political engineering]], which deal with forming [[political structure|political]] and [[social structure]]s using engineering methodology coupled with [[political science]] principles.
