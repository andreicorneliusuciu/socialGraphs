Some of the most common waveforms produced by the function generator are the sine, square, triangular and sawtooth shapes. These waveforms can be either repetitive or single-shot (which requires an internal or external trigger source).<ref name=\"cnx.org\">[http://cnx.org/content/m11895/latest/ cnx.org - Using a Basic Function Generator], 2005-08-21</ref> [[Integrated circuit]]s used to generate waveforms may also be described as function generator ICs.\n\nAlthough function generators cover both audio and RF frequencies, they are usually not suitable for applications that need low distortion or stable frequency signals. When those traits are required, other [[signal generator]]s would be more appropriate.\n\nSome function generators can be phase-locked to an external signal source (which may be a frequency reference) or another function generator.<ref name=bakshi>{{cite book |last1=Bakshi |first1=U.

For example, they may be used as a signal source to test amplifiers or to introduce an error signal into a control loop. Function generators are primarily used for working with [[analog circuit]]s, related [[pulse generator]]s are primarily used for working with [[digital circuit]]s.\n\n== Electronic instruments ==\n\n=== Working ===\nSimple function generators usually generate triangular waveform whose frequency can be controlled smoothly as well as in steps.<ref name=\"Introduction to System Design Using Integrated Circuits\">{{cite book |last=Sonde |first=B.

The triangular wave is generated by repeatedly charging and discharging a [[capacitor]] from a constant [[current source]]. This produces a [[linear]]ly ascending and descending voltage ramp. As the output voltage reaches upper or lower limits, the charging or discharging is reversed using a [[comparator]], producing the linear triangle wave. By varying the [[current (electricity)|current]] and the size of the capacitor, different [[frequency|frequencies]] may be obtained. [[Sawtooth wave]]s can be produced by charging the capacitor slowly, using a current, but using a diode over the current source to discharge quickly - the polarity of the diode changes the polarity of the resulting sawtooth, i.e. slow rise and fast fall, or fast rise and slow fall.\n\nA 50% [[duty cycle]] [[square wave]] is easily obtained by noting whether the capacitor is being charged or discharged, which is reflected in the current switching comparator output. Other duty cycles (theoretically from 0% to 100%) can be obtained by using a comparator and the sawtooth or triangle signal. Most function generators also contain a non-linear [[diode]] [[Waveform shaping|shaping circuit]] that can convert the triangle wave into a reasonably accurate [[sine wave]] by rounding off the corners of the triangle wave in a process similar to [[Clipping (audio)|clipping]] in audio systems.\n\nA typical function generator can provide frequencies up to 20&nbsp;MHz. RF generators for higher frequencies are not function generators in the strict sense since they typically produce pure or modulated sine signals only.\n\nFunction generators, like most [[signal generator]]s, may also contain an [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuator]], various means of [[modulation|modulating]] the output waveform, and often the ability to automatically and repetitively \"sweep\" the frequency of the output waveform (by means of a [[voltage-controlled oscillator]]) between two operator-determined limits. This capability makes it very easy to evaluate the [[frequency response]] of a given [[electronic circuit]].\n\nSome function generators can also generate [[white noise|white]] or [[pink noise]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nMore advanced function generators are called [[arbitrary waveform generator]]s (AWG). They use [[Direct digital synthesizer|direct digital synthesis]] (DDS) techniques to generate any waveform that can be described by a table of amplitudes.\n\n=== Specifications ===\nTypical specifications for a general-purpose function generator are:\n* Produces sine, square, triangular, sawtooth (ramp), and pulse output. [[Arbitrary waveform generator]]s can produce waves of any shape.<ref name=bakshi/>\n* It can generate a wide range of frequencies. For example, the Tektronix FG 502 (ca 1974) covers 0.1&nbsp;Hz to 11&nbsp;MHz.<ref name=\"FG502\">{{Citation |title=FG 502 Function Generator |year=1973 |series=Instruction Manual |publisher=Tektronix |location=Beaverton, OR |doi= }}, pp=1-7&ndash;1-8</ref>\n* Frequency stability of 0.1 percent per hour for analog generators<ref name=\"FG502\"/> or {{nowrap|500 ppm}} for a digital generator.\n* Maximum sinewave [[distortion]] of about 1% (accuracy of diode shaping network) for analog generators.<ref>FG 502 distortion is {{nowrap|0.5 percent}}</ref> Arbitrary waveform generators may have distortion less than {{nowrap|-55 dB}} below {{nowrap|50 kHz}} and less than {{nowrap|-40 dB}} above {{nowrap|50 kHz.}}\n* Some function generators can be phase locked to an external signal source, which may be a frequency reference or another function generator.\n* Amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), or phase modulation (PM) may be supported.\n* Output amplitude up to {{nowrap|10 V}} [[peak-to-peak]].\n* Amplitude can be modified, usually by a calibrated [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuator]] with decade steps and continuous adjustment within each decade.\n* Some generators provide a DC offset voltage, e.g. adjustable between -5V to +5V.<ref name=bakshi/>\n* An output impedance of {{nowrap|50 \u03a9}}.\n\n=== Software ===\nA completely different approach to function generation is to use [[software]] instructions to generate a waveform, with provision for output. For example, a general-purpose [[digital computer]] can be used to generate the waveform; if frequency range and amplitude are acceptable, the [[sound card]] fitted to most computers can be used to output the generated wave.\n\n== Circuit elements ==\n\n===Waveform generator===\nAn electronic circuit element used for generating waveforms within other apparatus that can be used in communications and instrumentation circuits, and also in a function generator instrument.
