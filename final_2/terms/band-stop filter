It is the opposite of a [[band-pass filter]].  A '''notch filter''' is a band-stop filter with a narrow [[stopband]] (high [[Q factor]]).\n\nNarrow notch filters ([[optical]]) are used in [[Raman spectroscopy]], live sound reproduction ([[public address system]]s, or PA systems) and in [[instrument amplifier]]s (especially amplifiers or [[preamplifier]]s for acoustic instruments such as [[acoustic guitar]], [[mandolin]], [[double bass|bass instrument amplifier]], etc.) to reduce or prevent [[audio feedback]], while having little noticeable effect on the rest of the frequency spectrum ([[Electronics|electronic]] or [[computer software|software]] filters). Other names include 'band limit filter', 'T-notch filter', 'band-elimination filter', and 'band-reject filter'.\n\nTypically, the width of the stopband is 1 to 2 [[decade (log scale)|decade]]s (that is, the highest frequency attenuated is 10 to 100 times the lowest frequency attenuated).  However, in the [[Audio frequency|audio]] band, a notch filter has high and low frequencies that may be only [[semitone]]s apart.\n\n[[Image:Band-Reject_Filter.svg|frame|right|Generic electrical schematic of a simple band-stop filter]]\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== In the audio domain ===\n'''Anti-hum filter'''\n\nFor countries using 60&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] [[electric power transmission|power lines]]:\n*Low Freq: 59&nbsp;Hz \n*Middle Freq 60&nbsp;Hz \n*High Freq: 61&nbsp;Hz\nThis means that the filter passes all frequencies, except for the range of 59\u201361&nbsp;Hz.  This would be used to filter out the [[mains hum]] from the 60&nbsp;Hz power line, though its higher harmonics could still be present.\n\nFor countries where power transmission is at 50&nbsp;Hz, the filter would have a 49\u201351&nbsp;Hz range.\n\n'''Anti-presence filter'''\n\n*Low Freq: 1&nbsp;[[kHz]]\n*High Freq: 4&nbsp;kHz\n\nFor attenuating [[Presence_(amplification)|presence]].\n\n=== In the radio frequency (RF) domain ===\n'''Non-linearities of power amplifiers'''\n\nWhen measuring the non-linearities of power amplifiers, a very narrow notch filter can be very useful to avoid the [[carrier frequency]]. Use of the filter may ensure that the maximum input power of a spectrum analyser used to detect spurious content will not be exceeded.\n\n'''Wave trap''' {{anchor|wave trap}}\n\nA notch filter, usually a simple LC circuit, is used to remove a specific interfering frequency.  This is a technique used with radio receivers that are so close to a transmitter that it swamps all other signals.  The wave trap is used to remove, or greatly reduce, the signal from the local transmitter.<ref>Joseph J.
