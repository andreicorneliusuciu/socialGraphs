The \"[[wiktionary:auto-|auto]]\" (Greek for \"self\") prefix refers to the single coil acting alone and '''not''' to any kind of [[Automation|automatic mechanism]]. In an autotransformer, portions of the same winding act as both the [[primary winding|primary]] and [[secondary winding|secondary]] sides of the transformer.  In contrast, an ordinary transformer has separate [[primary winding|primary]] and [[secondary winding]]s which are not electrically connected.\n\nThe winding has at least three [[Tap (transformer)|taps]] where electrical connections are made.  Since part of the winding does \"double duty\", autotransformers have the advantages of often being smaller, lighter, and cheaper than typical dual-winding transformers, but the disadvantage of not providing [[Galvanic isolation|electrical isolation]] between primary and secondary circuits. Other advantages of autotransformers include lower [[Leakage inductance|leakage]] reactance, lower losses, lower excitation current, and increased VA rating for a given size and mass.{{sfn|Sen|1997|p=64}}\n\nAutotransformers are often used to step up or step down voltages in the 110-115-120 V range and voltages in the 220-230-240 V range - for example, providing 110 V or 120 V (with taps) from 230 V input, allowing equipment designed for 100 or 120 V to be used with a 230 V supply.  This allows US electrical equipment to be fed from the higher European voltage.  Autotransformers can also be used to supply European 230 V appliances from a 100 or 120 V supply in countries outside Europe.  In all cases the supply and the autotransformer must be correctly rated to supply the required power.\n\n==Operation==\n[[Image:Tapped autotransformer.svg|thumb|right|300px|Single-phase tapped autotransformer with output voltage range of 40%&ndash;115% of input]]\n\nAn autotransformer has a single winding with two end terminals, and one or more terminals at intermediate tap points, or it is a transformer in which the primary and secondary coils have part of, or all of their turns in common. The primary voltage is applied across two of the terminals, and the secondary voltage taken from two terminals, almost always having one terminal in common with the primary voltage. The primary and secondary circuits therefore have a number of windings turns in common.<ref>{{cite book | last = Pansini | title = Electrical Transformers and Power Equipment | pages = 89\u201391}}</ref> Since the volts-per-turn is the same in both windings, each develops a voltage in proportion to its number of turns. In an autotransformer part of the current flows directly from the input to the output, and only part is transferred inductively, allowing a smaller, lighter, cheaper core to be used as well as requiring only a single winding.<ref>[http://victoruae.com/auto_transformer_detail.html Commercial site explaining why autotransformers are smaller]</ref> However the voltage and current ratio of autotransformers can be formulated the same as other two-winding transformers:{{sfn|Sen|1997|p=64}}\n\n<math>\\frac{V_1}{V_2}=\\frac{N_1}{N_2} = a </math>\n\n(0<V<sub>2</sub><V<sub>1</sub>)\n\nThe ampere-turns provided by the upper half:\n\n<math>F_U = (N_1 - N_2)I_1 = (1-\\frac{1}{a})N_1I_1</math>\n\nThe ampere-turns provided by the lower half:\n\n<math>F_L = N_2(I_2 - I_1) = \\frac{N_1}{a}(I_2-I_1)</math>\n\nFor ampere-turn balance, F<sub>U</sub>=F<sub>L</sub>:\n\n<math>(1-\\frac{1}{a})N_1 I_1 = \\frac{N_1}{a}(I_2-I_1)</math>\n\nTherefore:\n\n<math>\\frac{I_1}{I_2} = \\frac{1}{a}</math>\n\nOne end of the winding is usually connected in common to both the [[voltage source]] and the [[External electric load|electrical load]].  The other end of the source and load are connected to taps along the winding.  Different taps on the winding correspond to different voltages, measured from the common end. In a step-down transformer the source is usually connected across the entire winding while the load is connected by a tap across only a portion of the winding.  In a step-up transformer, conversely, the load is attached across the full winding while the source is connected to a tap across a portion of the winding.\n\nAs in a two-winding transformer, the ratio of secondary to primary voltages is equal to the ratio of the number of turns of the winding they connect to. For example, connecting the load between the middle and bottom of the autotransformer will reduce the voltage by 50%.  Depending on the application, that portion of the winding used solely in the higher-voltage (lower current) portion may be wound with wire of a smaller gauge, though the entire winding is directly connected.\n\nIf one of the center-taps is used for the ground, then the autotransformer can be used as a [[balun]] to convert a [[balanced line]] (connected to the two end taps) to an [[unbalanced line]] (the side with the ground).\n\n==Limitations==\nAn autotransformer does not provide electrical isolation between its windings as an ordinary transformer does; if the [[Neutral wire|neutral]] side of the input is not at ground voltage, the neutral side of the output will not be either. A failure of the isolation of the windings of an autotransformer can result in full input [[voltage]] applied to the output. Also, a break in the part of the winding that is used as both primary and secondary will result in the transformer acting as an inductor in series with the load (which under light load conditions may result in near full input voltage being applied to the output).  These are important safety considerations when deciding to use an autotransformer in a given application.\n\nBecause it requires both fewer windings and a smaller core, an autotransformer for power applications is typically lighter and less costly than a two-winding transformer, up to a voltage ratio of about 3:1; beyond that range, a two-winding transformer is usually more economical.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn [[three phase]] power transmission applications, autotransformers have the limitations of not suppressing [[Harmonics (electrical power)|harmonic]] currents and as acting as another source of [[Residual-current device|ground fault]] currents. A large three-phase autotransformer may have a \"buried\" delta winding, not connected to the outside of the tank, to absorb some harmonic currents.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn practice, losses mean that both standard transformers and autotransformers are not perfectly reversible; one designed for stepping down a voltage will deliver slightly less voltage than required  if it is used to step up. {{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} The difference is usually slight enough to allow reversal where the actual voltage level is not critical.\n\nLike multiple-winding transformers, autotransformers use time-varying [[magnetic field]]s to transfer power. They require [[alternating current]]s to operate properly and will not function on [[direct current]].\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Power transmission and distribution===\nAutotransformers are frequently used in [[power transmission|power]] applications to interconnect systems operating at different voltage classes, for example 132&nbsp;kV to 66&nbsp;kV for transmission. Another application in industry is to adapt machinery built (for example) for 480&nbsp;V supplies to operate on a 600&nbsp;V supply. They are also often used for providing conversions between the two common    domestic mains voltage bands in the world (100&nbsp;V&mdash;130&nbsp;V and 200&nbsp;V&mdash;250&nbsp;V). The links between the UK 400&nbsp;kV and 275&nbsp;kV '[[Super Grid]]' networks are normally three phase autotransformers with taps at the common neutral end.\n\nOn long rural power distribution lines, special autotransformers with automatic tap-changing equipment are inserted as [[voltage regulator]]s, so that customers at the far end of the line receive the same average voltage as those closer to the source. The variable ratio of the autotransformer compensates for the [[voltage drop]] along the line.\n\nA special form of autotransformer called a ''[[Zigzag transformer|zig zag]]'' is used to provide [[Earthing system|grounding]] on three-phase systems that otherwise have no connection to ground. A [[Zigzag transformer|zig-zag transformer]] provides a path for current that is common to all three phases (so-called ''zero sequence'' current).\n\n===Audio system ===\nIn audio applications, tapped autotransformers are used to adapt speakers to constant-voltage audio distribution systems, and for [[impedance matching]] such as between a low-impedance microphone and a high-impedance amplifier input.\n\n===Railways===\n{{main|25 kV AC railway electrification}}\nIn UK railway applications, it is common to power the trains at 25 kV AC. To increase the distance between electricity supply Grid feeder points they can be arranged to supply a 25-0-25 kV supply with the third wire (opposite phase) out of reach of the train's overhead collector pantograph. The 0 V point of the supply is connected to the rail while one 25 kV point is connected to the overhead contact wire. At frequent (about 10&nbsp;km) intervals, an autotransformer links the contact wire to rail and to the second (antiphase) supply conductor. This system increases usable transmission distance, reduces induced interference into external equipment and reduces cost. A variant is occasionally seen where the supply conductor is at a different voltage to the contact wire with the autotransformer ratio modified to suit.<ref>\"''Fahrleitungen electrischer Bahnen''\" BG Teubner-Verlag, Stuttgart, page 672. An English edition \"Contact Lines for Electric Railways\" appears to be out of print. This industry standard text describes the various European electrification principles. See the website of the UIC in Paris for the relevant international rail standards, in English. No comparable publications seem to exist for American railways, probably due to the paucity of electrified installations there.</ref>\n\n==Variable autotransformers==<!--[[Variac]] links to this section-->\n[[Image:Variable Transformer 01.jpg|thumb|left|240px|A variable autotransformer, with a sliding-brush secondary connection and a toroidal core. Cover has been removed to show copper windings and brush.]]\n[[Image:Variable Transformer MFrey 001.jpg|thumb|Variable Transformer - part of Tektronix 576 Curve Tracer]]\nBy exposing part of the winding coils and making the secondary connection through a sliding [[brush (electric)|brush]], a continuously variable turns ratio can be obtained, allowing for very smooth control of output voltage. The output voltage is not limited to the discrete voltages represented by actual number of turns. The voltage can be smoothly varied between turns as the brush has a relatively high resistance (compared with a metal contact) and the actual output voltage is a function of the relative area of brush in contact with adjacent windings.<ref>{{cite book\n|author1=Bakshi, M. V.  |author2=Bakshi, U. A.\n |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Electrical Machines - I\n| page = 330\n| isbn = 81-8431-009-9}}</ref> The relatively high resistance of the brush also prevents it from acting as a short circuited turn when it contacts two adjacent turns.  Typically the primary connection connects to only a part of the winding allowing the output voltage to be varied smoothly from zero to above the input voltage and thus allowing the device to be used for testing electrical equipment at the limits of its specified voltage range.\n\nThe output voltage adjustment can be manual or automatic. The manual type is applicable only for relatively low voltage and is known as a variable AC transformer (often referred to by the trademark name Variac). These are often used in repair shops for testing devices under different voltages or to simulate abnormal line voltages.\n\nThe type with automatic voltage adjustment can be used as automatic [[voltage regulator]], to maintain a steady voltage at the customers' service during a wide range of  line and load conditions.  Another application is a lighting [[dimmer]] that doesn't produce the [[Electromagnetic interference|EMI]] typical of most [[thyristor]] dimmers.\n\n===Variac Trademark===\nFrom 1934 to 2002, '''Variac''' was a U.S. trademark of [[General Radio]] for a variable autotransformer intended to conveniently vary the output voltage for a steady AC input voltage. In 2004, Instrument Service Equipment applied for and obtained the ''Variac'' trademark for the same type of product.<ref>http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=76573123&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=documentSearch</ref>\nThis word has become generic for hand-variable autotransformers in general.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Balun]]\n* [[Electromagnetism]]\n* [[Faraday's law of induction]]\n* [[Ignition coil]]\n* [[Inductor]]\n* [[Magnetic field]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sen|first=P.
