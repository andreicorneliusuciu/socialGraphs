A schematic usually omits all details that are not relevant to the information the schematic is intended to convey, and may add unrealistic elements that aid comprehension.  For example, a subway map intended for passengers may represent a subway station with a dot; the dot doesn't resemble the actual station at all but gives the viewer information  without unnecessary visual clutter. A schematic diagram of a chemical process uses symbols to represent the vessels, piping, valves, pumps, and other equipment of the system, emphasizing their interconnection paths and suppressing physical details.  In an electronic [[circuit diagram]], the layout of the symbols may not resemble the layout in the circuit. In the schematic  diagram, the symbolic elements are arranged to be more easily interpreted by the viewer.\n\n==Types==\n'''Schematics''' and other types of diagrams, e.g.,\n{|style=\"width:100%\"\n|style=\"vertical-align:top; width:25px;\"|\n|style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n<gallery mode=packed style=\"text-align:left\">\nFile:London Underground Overground DLR Crossrail map.svg|[[Transit map]], a schematic map (i.e. not drawn to scale, stations are equidistant, lines are drawn at 45 and 90-degree angles)\nFile:US 2000 census population density map by state.svg|[[Population density|population density map]]\nFile:Continuous Binary Fractional Distillation EN.svg|[[Chemical engineering]] schematic\nFile:4 bit counter.svg|Electrical [[circuit diagram]] for [[Transistor-transistor logic|TTL]] counter, a type of [[state machine]]\nFile:Automotive diagrams 01 En.png|Schematic of a [[drive train]]\nFile:Gear pump exploded.png|[[exploded view]] of a 3D-[[engineering drawing]]\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nA '''semi-schematic''' diagram combines some of the abstraction of a purely schematic diagram with other elements displayed as realistically as possible, for various reasons. It is a compromise between a purely abstract diagram (e.g. the schematic of the Washington Metro) and an exclusively realistic representation (e.g. the corresponding aerial view of Washington).\n\n[[File:Part of Tabula Peutingeriana.jpg|thumb|right|240|A semi-schematic map: [[Tabula Peutingeriana]]. While roads and features appear as abstract representations without resemblance to reality, their locations, orientations, and distances are as accurate as possible to make the map practical.]]\n\n==Electrical and electronic industry==\n{{Main|circuit diagram}}\n\nIn electrical and electronic industry, a schematic diagram is often used to describe the design of equipment. Schematic diagrams are often used for the maintenance and repair of electronic and electromechanical systems.<ref name=FV75>Thomas E. French, Charles J. Vierck (1975). ''Engineering Drawing and Graphic Technology, Eleventh Edition''. McGraw Hill. ISBN 0-07-022157-X.  pp. 621\u2013624.</ref> Original schematics were done by hand, using standardized templates or pre-printed adhesive symbols,  but today [[electronic design automation]] software (EDA or \"electrical CAD\") is often used.\n\nIn electronic design automation, until the 1980s schematics were virtually the only formal representation for circuits. More recently, with the progress of computer technology, other representations were introduced and specialized [[computer language]]s were developed, since with the explosive growth of the complexity of electronic circuits, traditional schematics are becoming less practical. For example, [[hardware description language]]s are indispensable for modern [[digital circuit]] design.\n\nSchematics for electronic circuits are prepared by designers using EDA ([[electronic design automation]]) tools called [[schematic capture]] tools or [[schematic entry]] tools. These tools go beyond simple drawing of devices and connections. Usually they are integrated into the whole IC design flow and linked to other EDA tools for verification and simulation of the circuit under design.\n\nIn electric power systems design, a schematic drawing called a [[one-line diagram]] is frequently used to represent [[Electrical substation|substations]], distribution systems or even whole electrical power grids. These diagrams simplify and compress the details that would be repeated on each phase of a [[three-phase]] system, showing only one element instead of three. Electrical diagrams for switchgear often have common device functions designate by [[ANSI Device Numbers|standard function numbers]].\n\n==Schematics in repair manuals==\n\nSchematic diagrams are used extensively in repair manuals to help users understand the interconnections of parts, and to provide graphical instruction to assist in dismantling and rebuilding mechanical assemblies.  Many automotive and motorcycle [[Repairing|repair]] manuals devote a significant number of pages to schematic diagrams.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* [[Energy Systems Language]]\n* [[Chart]]\n* [[Diagram]]\n* [[Straight-line diagram]]\n* [[Topological map]]\n* [[Transit map]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n\n{{Visualization}}\n\n[[Category:Diagrams]]\n[[Category:Electronic design automation]]\n[[Category:Technical communication]]\n[[Category:Infographics]]"}]}}}}
