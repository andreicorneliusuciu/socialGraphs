This property can have dramatic consequences, as illustrated by the use of friction created by rubbing pieces of wood together to start a fire. Kinetic energy is converted to thermal energy whenever motion with friction occurs, for example when a [[Viscous flow|viscous]] fluid is stirred. Another important consequence of many types of friction can be [[wear]], which may lead to performance degradation and/or damage to components. Friction is a component of the science of [[tribology]].\n \nFriction is not itself a [[fundamental force]]. Dry friction arises from a combination of inter-surface adhesion, surface roughness, surface deformation, and surface contamination. The complexity of these interactions makes the calculation of friction from [[first principle]]s  impractical and necessitates the use of [[empirical method]]s for analysis and the development of theory.\n\nFriction is a [[Conservative force#Nonconservative forces|non-conservative force]] - work done against friction is path dependent. In the presence of friction, some energy is always lost in the form of heat. Thus mechanical energy is not conserved.\n\n==History==\nThe Greeks, including [[Aristotle]], [[Vitruvius]], and [[Pliny the Elder]], were interested in the cause and mitigation of friction.<ref name=Chatterjee2008>{{cite thesis |last=Chatterjee |first=Sudipta |year=2008 |title=Tribological Properties of Pseudo-elastic Nickel-titanium |publisher=University of California |via=ProQuest |isbn=9780549844372 |pages=11\u201312 |url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=rX6xfoEaYtQC&pg=PA12 |quote=Classical Greek philosophers like Aristotle, Pliny the Elder and Vitruvius wrote about the existence of friction, the effect of lubricants and the advantages of metal bearings around 350 B.C.}}</ref> They were aware of differences between static and kinetic friction with [[Themistius]] stating in 350 {{Smallcaps2|A.D.}} that \"it is easier to further the motion of a moving body than to move a body at rest\".<ref name=Chatterjee2008/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Fishbane |first1=Paul M. |last2=Gasiorowicz |first2=Stephen |last3=Thornton |first3=Stephen T. |year=1993 |title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers |edition=Extended |volume=I |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey |isbn=0-13-663246-7 |page=135 |quote=Themistius first stated around 350 {{Smallcaps2|{{sic|B.C.|expected=A.D.}}}} that kinetic friction is weaker than the maximum value of static friction.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Hecht |first=Eugene |date=2003 |title=Physics: Algebra/Trig |edition=3rd |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=9780534377298}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Sambursky |first=Samuel |date=2014 |title=The Physical World of Late Antiquity |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9781400858989 |pages=65\u201366 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yvz_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA65}}</ref>\n\nThe classic laws of sliding friction were discovered by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]  in 1493, a pioneer in [[tribology]], but the laws documented in his notebooks, were not published and remained unknown.<ref name=\"Dowson\" >{{cite book |last=Dowson |first=Duncan |year=1997 |title=History of Tribology |edition=2nd |publisher=Professional Engineering Publishing |isbn=1-86058-070-X}}</ref><ref name=\"Armstrong\" >{{cite book |last=Armstrong-H\u00e9louvry |first=Brian |year=1991 |title=Control of machines with friction |publisher=Springer |location=USA |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0zk_zI3xACgC&pg=PA10 |isbn=0-7923-9133-0}}</ref><ref name=\"VanBeek\">{{cite web |last=van Beek |first=Anton |title=History of Science Friction |publisher=tribology-abc.com |url=http://www.tribology-abc.com/abc/history.htm |accessdate=2011-03-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Hutchings |first=Ian M.  |date=2016 |title=Leonardo da Vinci's studies of friction |doi=10.1016/j.wear.2016.04.019 |url=http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/uploads/Hutchings_Leonardo_Friction_2016_v2.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Hutchings |first=Ian M. |date=2016-08-15 |title=Leonardo da Vinci's studies of friction |journal=Wear |doi=10.1016/j.wear.2016.04.019 |volume=360\u2013361 |pages=51\u201366 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043164816300588}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Study reveals Leonardo da Vinci's 'irrelevant' scribbles mark the spot where he first recorded the laws of friction |url=http://phys.org/news/2016-07-reveals-leonardo-da-vinci-irrelevant.html |access-date=2016-07-26}}</ref> These laws were rediscovered by [[Guillaume Amontons]] in 1699. Amontons presented the nature of friction in terms of surface irregularities and the force required to raise the weight pressing the surfaces together. This view was further elaborated by [[Bernard Forest de B\u00e9lidor]] <ref>[[Bernard Forest de B\u00e9lidor|Forest de B\u00e9lidor, Bernard]]. \"[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b53032692q.r=Belidor%2C%20Bernard%20Forest%20de Richtige Grund-S\u00e4tze der Friction-Berechnung]\" (\"Correct Basics of Friction Calculation\"), 1737, (in [[German language|German]])</ref> and [[Leonhard Euler]] (1750), who derived the [[angle of repose]] of a weight on an inclined plane and first distinguished between static and kinetic friction.<ref>{{cite web\n  | title = Leonhard Euler\n  | work = Friction Module\n  | publisher = Nano World \n  | year = 2002\n  | url = http://www.nano-world.org/frictionmodule/content/0200makroreibung/0400historisch/0300euler/?lang=en\n  | accessdate = 2011-03-25}}</ref>\nA different explanation was provided by [[John Theophilus Desaguliers]] (1725), who demonstrated the strong [http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Core/Physical_Chemistry/Physical_Properties_of_Matter/Bulk_Properties/Cohesive_And_Adhesive_Forces cohesion forces] between [[lead]] spheres of which a small [[Spherical cap|cap]] is cut off and which were then brought into contact with each other.\n \nThe understanding of friction was further developed by [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] (1785). Coulomb investigated the influence of four main factors on friction: the nature of the materials in contact and their surface coatings; the extent of the surface area; the normal pressure (or load); and the length of time that the surfaces remained in contact (time of repose).<ref name=\"Dowson\" /> Coulomb further considered the influence of sliding velocity, temperature and humidity, in order to decide between the different explanations on the nature of friction that had been proposed. The distinction between static and dynamic friction is made in Coulomb's friction law (see below), although this distinction was already drawn by [[Johann Andreas von Segner]] in 1758.<ref name=\"Dowson\" />\nThe effect of the time of repose was explained by [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] (1762) by considering the surfaces of fibrous materials, with fibers meshing together, which takes a finite time in which the friction increases.\n\n[[John Leslie (physicist)|John Leslie]] (1766\u20131832) noted a weakness in the views of Amontons and Coulomb: If friction arises from a weight being drawn up the inclined plane of successive asperities, why then isn't it balanced through descending the opposite slope? Leslie was equally skeptical about the role of adhesion proposed by Desaguliers, which should on the whole have the same tendency to accelerate as to retard the motion.<ref name=\"Dowson\" /> In Leslie's view, friction should be seen as a time-dependent process of flattening, pressing down asperities, which creates new obstacles in what were cavities before.\n\n[[Arthur Jules Morin]] (1833) developed the concept of sliding versus rolling friction.  [[Osborne Reynolds]] (1866) derived the equation of viscous flow.  This completed the classic empirical model of friction (static, kinetic, and fluid) commonly used today in engineering.<ref name=\"Armstrong\" /> In 1877,  [[Fleeming Jenkin]] and [[J. A. Ewing]] investigated the continuity between static and kinetic friction.<ref>[[Fleeming Jenkin]] & [[James Alfred Ewing]] (1877) \"[http://biodiversitylibrary.org/item/121556#page/322/mode/1up On Friction between Surfaces moving at Low Speeds]\", ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'' Series 5, volume 4, pp 308\u201310; link from [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]]</ref>\n\nThe focus of research during the [[20th century]] has been to understand the physical mechanisms behind friction. [[Frank Philip Bowden]] and [[David Tabor]] (1950) showed that, at a [[Microscopic scale|microscopic level]], the actual area of contact between surfaces is a very small fraction of the apparent area.<ref name=\"VanBeek\" />  This actual area of contact, caused by \"[[Asperity (materials science)|asperities]]\" (roughness)  increases with pressure. The development of the [[atomic force microscope]] (ca. 1986)  enabled scientists to study friction at the [[Atomic units|atomic scale]],<ref name=\"Armstrong\" /> showing that, on that scale, dry friction is the product of the inter-surface [[shear stress]] and the contact area. These two discoveries explain the macroscopic proportionality between normal force and static frictional force between dry surfaces.\n\n==Laws of dry friction==\nThe elementary property of sliding (kinetic) friction were discovered by experiment in the 15th to 18th centuries and were expressed as three empirical laws:\n*'''[[Guillaume Amontons#Amontons' Laws of Friction|Amontons' First Law]]''': The force of friction is directly proportional to the applied load.\n*'''Amontons' Second Law''': The force of friction is independent of the apparent area of contact.\n*'''Coulomb's Law of Friction''': Kinetic friction is independent of the sliding velocity.\n\n==Dry friction<!--Charles-Augustin de Coulomb links here-->==\nDry friction resists relative lateral motion of two solid surfaces in contact. The two regimes of dry friction are 'static friction' (\"[[stiction]]\") between non-moving surfaces, and ''kinetic friction'' (sometimes called sliding friction or dynamic friction) between moving surfaces.\n\nCoulomb friction, named after [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]], is an approximate model used to calculate the force of dry friction. It is governed by the model:\n\n:<math>F_\\mathrm{f} \\leq \\mu F_\\mathrm{n},</math>\nwhere\n*<math>F_\\mathrm{f}\\,</math> is the force of friction exerted by each surface on the other.  It is parallel to the surface, in a direction opposite to the net applied force.\n*<math>\\mu\\,</math> is the coefficient of friction, which is an empirical property of the contacting materials,\n*<math>F_\\mathrm{n}\\,</math> is the [[normal force]] exerted by each surface on the other, directed perpendicular (normal) to the surface.\n\nThe Coulomb friction <math>F_\\mathrm{f}\\,</math> may take any value from zero up to <math>\\mu F_\\mathrm{n}\\,</math>, and the direction of the frictional force against a surface is opposite to the motion that surface would experience in the absence of friction. Thus, in the static case, the frictional force is exactly what it must be in order to prevent motion between the surfaces; it balances the net force tending to cause such motion. In this case, rather than providing an estimate of the actual frictional force, the Coulomb approximation provides a threshold value for this force, above which motion would commence. This maximum force is known as [[Traction (engineering)|traction]].\n\nThe force of friction is always exerted in a direction that opposes movement (for kinetic friction) or potential movement (for static friction) between the two surfaces. For example, a [[curling]] stone sliding along the ice experiences a kinetic force slowing it down. For an example of potential movement, the drive wheels of an accelerating car experience a frictional force pointing forward; if they did not, the wheels would spin, and the rubber would slide backwards along the pavement. Note that it is not the direction of movement of the vehicle they oppose, it is the direction of (potential) sliding between tire and road.\n\n===Normal force===\n[[Image:Free body diagram2.svg|right|200px|thumb|[[Free-body diagram]] for a block on a ramp. Arrows are [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] indicating directions and magnitudes of forces. ''N'' is the normal force, ''mg'' is the force of [[gravity]], and ''F<sub>f</sub>'' is the force of friction.]]\n\n{{Main article|Normal force}}\n\nThe normal force is defined as the net force compressing two parallel surfaces together; and its direction is perpendicular to the surfaces. In the simple case of a mass resting on a horizontal surface, the only component of the normal force is the force due to gravity, where <math>N=mg\\,</math>. In this case, the magnitude of the friction force is the product of the mass of the object, the acceleration due to gravity, and the coefficient of friction. However, the coefficient of friction is not a function of mass or volume; it depends only on the material. For instance, a large aluminum block has the same coefficient of friction as a small aluminum block. However, the magnitude of the friction force itself depends on the normal force, and hence on the mass of the block.\n\nIf an '''object is on a level surface''' and the force tending to cause it to slide is horizontal, the normal force <math>N\\,</math> between the object and the surface is just its weight, which is equal to its [[mass]] multiplied by the [[acceleration]] due to earth's gravity, ''[[standard gravity|g]]''. If the '''object is on a tilted surface''' such as an inclined plane, the normal force is less, because less of the force of gravity is perpendicular to the face of the plane. Therefore, the normal force, and ultimately the frictional force, is determined using [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] analysis, usually via a [[free body diagram]]. Depending on the situation, the calculation of the normal force may include forces other than gravity.\n\n===Coefficient of friction===\nThe '''coefficient of friction''' (COF), often symbolized by the Greek letter [[Mu (letter)|\u00b5]], is a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]] [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] value which describes the ratio of the force of friction between two bodies and the force pressing them together. The coefficient of friction depends on the materials used; for example, ice on steel has a low coefficient of friction, while rubber on pavement has a high coefficient of friction. Coefficients of friction range from near zero to greater than one.\n\nFor surfaces at rest relative to each other <math>\\mu = \\mu_\\mathrm{s}\\,</math>, where <math>\\mu_\\mathrm{s}\\,</math> is the ''coefficient of static friction''. This is usually larger than its kinetic counterpart.\n\nFor surfaces in relative motion <math>\\mu = \\mu_\\mathrm{k}\\,</math>, where <math>\\mu_\\mathrm{k}\\,</math> is the ''coefficient of kinetic friction''. The Coulomb friction is equal to <math>F_\\mathrm{f}\\,</math>, and the frictional force on each surface is exerted in the direction opposite to its motion relative to the other surface.\n\n[[Arthur Morin]] introduced the term and demonstrated the utility of the coefficient of friction.<ref name=\"Dowson\" /> The coefficient of friction is an [[empirical]] [[measurement]] \u2013 it has to be measured [[experiment]]ally, and cannot be found through calculations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Rougher surfaces tend to have higher effective values. Both static and kinetic coefficients of friction depend on the pair of surfaces in contact; for a given pair of surfaces, the coefficient of static friction is ''usually'' larger than that of kinetic friction; in some sets the two coefficients are equal, such as teflon-on-teflon.\n\nMost dry materials in combination have friction coefficient values between 0.3 and 0.6. Values outside this range are rarer, but [[polytetrafluoroethylene|teflon]], for example, can have a coefficient as low as 0.04. A value of zero would mean no friction at all, an elusive property. Rubber in contact with other surfaces can yield friction coefficients from 1 to 2. Occasionally it is maintained that \u00b5 is always < 1, but this is not true. While in most relevant applications \u00b5 < 1, a value above 1 merely implies that the force required to slide an object along the surface is greater than the normal force of the surface on the object. For example, [[silicone rubber]] or [[acrylic rubber]]-coated surfaces have a coefficient of friction that can be substantially larger than 1.\n\nWhile it is often stated that the COF is a \"material property,\" it is better categorized as a \"system property.\" Unlike true material properties (such as conductivity, dielectric constant, yield strength), the COF for any two materials depends on system variables like [[temperature]], [[velocity]], [[atmosphere]] and also what are now popularly described as aging and deaging times; as well as on geometric properties of the interface between the materials. For example, a [[copper]] pin sliding against a thick copper plate can have a COF that varies from 0.6 at low speeds (metal sliding against metal) to below 0.2 at high speeds when the copper surface begins to melt due to frictional heating. The latter speed, of course, does not determine the COF uniquely; if the pin diameter is increased so that the frictional heating is removed rapidly, the temperature drops, the pin remains solid and the COF rises to that of a 'low speed' test.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n====Approximate coefficients of friction====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|Materials !! colspan=\"2\"|Static Friction, <math>\\mu_\\mathrm{s}\\,</math> !! colspan=\"2\"|Kinetic/Sliding Friction, <math>\\mu_\\mathrm{k}\\,</math>\n|-\n|-\n!

The friction increases as the applied force increases until the block moves.  After the block moves, it experiences kinetic friction, which is less than the maximum static friction.]]\n\nStatic friction is friction between two or more solid objects that are not moving relative to each other. For example, static friction can prevent an object from sliding down a sloped surface. The coefficient of static friction, typically denoted as ''\u03bc''<sub>s</sub>, is usually higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction.\n\nThe static friction force must be overcome by an applied force before an object can move. The maximum possible friction force between two surfaces before sliding begins is the product of the coefficient of static friction and the normal force: <math>F_{max} = \\mu_\\mathrm{s} F_{n}\\,</math>. When there is no sliding occurring, the friction force can have any value from zero up to <math>F_{max}\\,</math>. Any force smaller than <math>F_{max}\\,</math> attempting to slide one surface over the other is opposed by a frictional force of equal magnitude and opposite direction.

Such reasoning aside, however, the approximation is fundamentally an empirical construct. It is a rule of thumb describing the approximate outcome of an extremely complicated physical interaction. The strength of the approximation is its simplicity and versatility. Though in general the relationship between normal force and frictional force is not exactly linear (and so the frictional force is not entirely independent of the contact area of the surfaces), the Coulomb approximation is an adequate representation of friction for the analysis of many physical systems.\n\nWhen the surfaces are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes a very poor approximation (for example, [[adhesive tape]] resists sliding even when there is no normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the frictional force may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some [[drag racing]] tires are adhesive for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.\n\n====\"Negative\" coefficient of friction====\n{{As of|2012}}, a single study has demonstrated the potential for an ''effectively negative coefficient of friction in the low-load regime'', meaning that a decrease in normal force leads to an increase in friction. This contradicts everyday experience in which an increase in normal force leads to an increase in friction.<ref name=deng2012/>  This was reported in the journal ''Nature'' in October 2012 and involved the friction encountered by an atomic force microscope stylus when dragged across a graphene sheet in the presence of graphene-adsorbed oxygen.<ref name=deng2012>{{cite journal |last1=Deng |first1=Zhao |display-authors=etal |date=October 14, 2012 |title=Adhesion-dependent negative friction coefficient on chemically modified graphite at the nanoscale |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |bibcode=2012NatMa..11.1032D |doi=10.1038/nmat3452 |url=http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nmat3452.html |accessdate=November 18, 2012 |laysummary=http://www.rdmag.com/news/2012/10/nanoscale-graphite-can-turn-friction-upside-down |laysource=R&D Magazine |laydate=October 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Numerical simulation of the Coulomb model===\nDespite being a simplified model of friction, the Coulomb model is useful in many [[Computer simulation|numerical simulation]] applications such as [[multibody system]]s and [[granular material]].

This internal resistance to flow is named ''[[viscosity]]''. In everyday terms, the viscosity of a fluid is described as its \"thickness\". Thus, water is \"thin\", having a lower viscosity, while honey is \"thick\", having a higher viscosity. The less viscous the fluid, the greater its ease of deformation or movement.\n\nAll real fluids (except [[superfluid]]s) offer some resistance to shearing and therefore are viscous. For teaching and explanatory purposes it is helpful to use the concept of an inviscid fluid or an [[ideal fluid]] which offers no resistance to shearing and so is not viscous.\n\n==Lubricated friction==\n{{Main article|Lubrication}}\n\nLubricated friction is a case of fluid friction where a fluid separates two solid surfaces. Lubrication is a technique employed to reduce wear of one or both surfaces in close proximity moving relative to each another by interposing a substance called a lubricant between the surfaces.\n\nIn most cases the applied load is carried by pressure generated within the fluid due to the frictional viscous resistance to motion of the lubricating fluid between the surfaces. Adequate lubrication allows smooth continuous operation of equipment, with only mild wear, and without excessive stresses or seizures at bearings. When lubrication breaks down, metal or other components can rub destructively over each other, causing heat and possibly damage or failure.\n\n==Skin friction==\n{{Main article|Parasitic drag}}\n\nSkin friction arises from the interaction between the fluid and the skin of the body, and is directly related to the area of the surface of the body that is in contact with the fluid. Skin friction follows the [[drag equation]] and rises with the square of the velocity.\n\nSkin friction is caused by viscous drag in the [[boundary layer]] around the object. There are two ways to decrease skin friction: the first is to shape the moving body so that smooth flow is possible, like an airfoil. The second method is to decrease the length and cross-section of the moving object as much as is practicable.\n\n==Internal friction==\n{{Main article|Plastic deformation of solids}}\n{{See also|Deformation (engineering)}}\nInternal friction is the force resisting motion between the elements making up a solid material while it undergoes [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]].\n\n[[Deformation (engineering)#Plastic deformation|Plastic deformation]] in solids is an irreversible change in the internal molecular structure of an object. This change may be due to either (or both) an applied force or a change in temperature. The change of an object's shape is called strain. The force causing it is called [[stress (mechanics)|stress]].\n\n[[Elastic deformation]] in solids is reversible change in the internal molecular structure of an object. Stress does not necessarily cause permanent change. As deformation occurs, internal forces oppose the applied force. If the applied stress is not too large these opposing forces may completely resist the applied force, allowing the object to assume a new equilibrium state and to return to its original shape when the force is removed. This is known as elastic deformation or elasticity.\n\n==Radiation friction==\nAs a consequence of light pressure, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]<ref>{{cite book|last= Einstein, A.|title=On the development of our views concerning the nature and constitution of radiation. Translated in: The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, vol. 2 (Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1989)|date=1909|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=391}}</ref> in 1909 predicted the existence of \"radiation friction\" which would oppose the movement of matter. He wrote, \u201cradiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The backwardacting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant 'radiation friction' in brief.\u201d\n\n==Other types of friction==\n\n===Rolling resistance===\n{{Main article|Rolling resistance}}\n\nRolling resistance is the force that resists the rolling of a wheel or other circular object along a surface caused by deformations in the object and/or surface. Generally the force of rolling resistance is less than that associated with kinetic friction.<ref>Silliman, Benjamin (1871) ''Principles of Physics, Or Natural Philosophy'', Ivison, Blakeman, Taylor & company publishers</ref> Typical values for the coefficient of rolling resistance are 0.001.<ref>Butt, Hans-J\u00fcrgen; Graf, Karlheinz and Kappl, Michael (2006) ''Physics and Chemistry of Interfaces'', Wiley, ISBN 3-527-40413-9</ref>\nOne of the most common examples of rolling resistance is the movement of [[motor vehicle]] tires on a [[road]], a process which generates heat and [[roadway noise|sound]] as by-products.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hogan |first1=C. Michael |title=Analysis of highway noise |journal=Water, Air, & Soil Pollution |volume=2 |pages=387\u2013392 |year=1973 |doi=10.1007/BF00159677 |issue=3}}</ref>\n\n===Braking friction===\nAny wheel equipped with a [[brake]] is capable of generating a large retarding force, usually for the purpose of slowing and stopping a vehicle or piece of rotating machinery. Braking friction differs from rolling friction because the coefficient of friction for rolling friction is small whereas the coefficient of friction for braking friction is designed to be large by choice of materials for [[brake pad]]s.\n\n===Triboelectric effect===\n{{Main article|Triboelectric effect}}\n\nRubbing dissimilar materials against one another can cause a build-up of [[electrostatic charge]], which can be hazardous if flammable gases or vapours are present. When the static build-up discharges, [[explosion]]s can be caused by ignition of the flammable mixture.\n\n===Belt friction===\n\n{{Main article|Belt friction}}\n\nBelt friction is a physical property observed from the forces acting on a belt wrapped around a pulley, when one end is being pulled. The resulting tension, which acts on both ends of the belt, can be modeled by the belt friction equation.\n\nIn practice, the theoretical tension acting on the belt or rope calculated by the belt friction equation can be compared to the maximum tension the belt can support. This helps a designer of such a rig to know how many times the belt or rope must be wrapped around the pulley to prevent it from slipping. Mountain climbers and sailing crews demonstrate a standard knowledge of belt friction when accomplishing basic tasks.\n\n==Reducing friction==\n\n===Devices===\nDevices such as wheels, [[ball bearing]]s, [[roller bearing]]s, and air cushion or other types of [[fluid bearing]]s can change sliding friction into a much smaller type of rolling friction.\n\nMany [[thermoplastic]] materials such as [[nylon]], [[HDPE]] and PTFE are commonly used in low friction [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]]. They are especially useful because the coefficient of friction falls with increasing imposed load.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} For improved wear resistance, very high [[molecular weight]] grades are usually specified for heavy duty or critical bearings.\n\n===Lubricants===\nA common way to reduce friction is by using a [[lubricant]], such as oil, water, or grease, which is placed between the two surfaces, often dramatically lessening the coefficient of friction. The science of friction and lubrication is called [[tribology]]. Lubricant technology is when lubricants are mixed with the application of science, especially to industrial or commercial objectives.\n\nSuperlubricity, a recently discovered effect, has been observed in [[graphite]]: it is the substantial decrease of friction between two sliding objects, approaching zero levels. A very small amount of frictional energy would still be dissipated.\n\nLubricants to overcome friction need not always be thin, turbulent fluids or powdery solids such as graphite and [[talc]]; [[acoustic lubrication]] actually uses sound as a lubricant.\n\nAnother way to reduce friction between two parts is to superimpose micro-scale vibration to one of the parts. This can be sinusoidal vibration as used in ultrasound-assisted cutting or vibration noise, known as [[dither]].\n\n==Energy of friction==\nAccording to the law of [[conservation of energy]], no energy is destroyed due to friction, though it may be lost to the system of concern. Energy is transformed from other forms into thermal energy. A sliding hockey puck comes to rest because friction converts its kinetic energy into heat which raises the thermal energy of the puck and the ice surface. Since heat quickly dissipates, many early philosophers, including [[Aristotle]], wrongly concluded that moving objects lose energy without a driving force.\n\nWhen an object is pushed along a surface along a path C, the energy converted to heat is given by a [[line integral]], in accordance with the definition of work\n   \n:<math>E_{th} = \\int_C \\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{fric}(\\mathbf{x}) \\cdot d\\mathbf{x}\\ = \\int_C \\mu_\\mathrm{k}\\ \\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{n}(\\mathbf{x}) \\cdot d\\mathbf{x}, </math>\nwhere\n: <math>\\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{fric}\\,</math> is the friction force,\n: <math>\\mathbf{F}_\\mathrm{n}\\,</math> is the vector obtained by multiplying the magnitude of the normal force by a unit vector pointing ''against'' the object's motion,\n: <math>\\mu_\\mathrm{k}\\,</math> is the coefficient of kinetic friction, which is inside the integral because it may vary from location to location (e.g. if the material changes along the path),\n: <math>\\mathbf{x}\\,</math> is the position of the object.\n\nEnergy lost to a system as a result of friction is a classic example of thermodynamic [[irreversibility]].\n\n===Work of friction===\nIn the reference frame of the interface between two surfaces, static friction does ''no'' [[mechanical work|work]], because there is never displacement between the surfaces. In the same reference frame, kinetic friction is always in the direction opposite the motion, and does ''negative'' work.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Den Hartog |first=J. P. |title=Mechanics |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |page=142 |year=1961 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WRXrtu44W9UC |isbn=0-486-60754-2}}</ref> However, friction can do ''positive'' work in certain [[frames of reference]]. One can see this by placing a heavy box on a rug, then pulling on the rug quickly. In this case, the box slides backwards relative to the rug, but moves forward relative to the frame of reference in which the floor is stationary. Thus, the kinetic friction between the box and rug accelerates the box in the same direction that the box moves, doing ''positive'' work.<ref>{{cite book\n| title = Minds-on Physics \n| first = William J\n| last = Leonard\n| year = 2000\n| publisher = Kendall/Hunt\n| isbn = 0-7872-3932-1\n| url = https://books.google.com/?id=t_AKvmza5s8C&pg=PA603\n| page = 603}}</ref>\n\nThe work done by friction can translate into deformation, wear, and heat that can affect the contact surface properties (even the coefficient of friction between the surfaces). This can be beneficial as in [[polishing]]. The work of friction is used to mix and join materials such as in the process of [[friction welding]]. Excessive erosion or wear of mating sliding surfaces occurs when work due to frictional forces rise to unacceptable levels. [[hardness|Harder]] corrosion particles caught between mating surfaces in relative motion ([[fretting]]) exacerbates wear of frictional forces. Bearing seizure or failure may result from excessive wear due to work of friction. As surfaces are worn by work due to friction, [[tolerance (engineering)|fit]] and [[Surface roughness|surface finish]] of an object may degrade until it no longer functions properly.<ref name=\"Bayer\">{{cite book |last=Bayer |first=Raymond George |title=Mechanical wear |publisher=CRC Press |year=2004 |pages=1, 2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q64Kq2HlyucC&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=Physical+wear+is+associated+with+friction |accessdate=2008-07-07 |isbn=0-8247-4620-1}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nFriction is an important factor in many [[engineering]] disciplines.\n\n===Transportation===\n*[[Vehicle brake|Automobile brakes]] inherently rely on friction, slowing a vehicle by converting its kinetic energy into heat.
