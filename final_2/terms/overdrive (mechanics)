The [[Power (physics)|power]] produced by an engine increases with the engine's RPM to a maximum, then falls away. The [[power band|point of maximum power]] is somewhat lower than the absolute maximum RPM to which the engine is limited, the \"[[redline]]\" RPM. A car's speed is limited by the power required to drive it against air resistance, which increases with speed. At the maximum possible speed, the engine is running at its point of maximum power, or ''power peak'', and the car is traveling at the speed where air resistance equals that maximum power. There is therefore one specific gear ratio at which the car can achieve its maximum speed: the one that matches that engine speed with that travel speed.<ref name=\"Setright, Anatomy of the Motor Car, Overdrive\" /> At travel speeds below this maximum, there is a range of gear ratios that can match engine power to air resistance, and the most fuel efficient is the one that results in the lowest engine speed.  Therefore, a car needs one gearing to reach maximum speed but another to reach maximum fuel\nefficiency at a lower speed.\n\nWith the early development of cars and the almost universal [[rear-wheel drive]] layout, the [[final drive]] (i.e. [[rear axle]]) ratio for fast cars was chosen to give the ratio for maximum speed. The [[gearbox]] was designed so that, for efficiency, the fastest ratio would be a \"direct-drive\" or \"straight-through\" 1:1 ratio, avoiding frictional losses in the gears. Achieving an overdriven ratio for cruising thus required a gearbox ratio even higher than this, i.e. the gearbox output shaft rotating ''faster'' than the engine. The [[propeller shaft]] linking gearbox and rear axle is thus overdriven, and a transmission capable of doing this became termed an \"overdrive\" transmission.<ref name=\"Setright, Anatomy of the Motor Car, Overdrive\" />\n\nThe device for achieving an overdrive transmission was usually a small separate gearbox, attached to the rear of the main gearbox and controlled by its own shift lever.<ref name=\"Setright, Anatomy of the Motor Car, Overdrive\" /> These were often optional on some models of the same car.\n\nAs popular cars became faster relative to legal limits and fuel costs became more important, particularly after the [[1973 oil crisis]], the use of 5-speed gearboxes became more common in mass-market cars. These had a direct (1:1) fourth gear with an overdrive 5th gear, replacing the need for the separate overdrive gearbox.<ref name=\"Setright, Anatomy of the Motor Car, Overdrive\" />\n\nWith the popularity of [[front wheel drive]] cars, the separate gearbox and final drive have merged into a single [[transaxle]]. There is no longer a propeller shaft and so one meaning of \"overdrive\" can no longer be applied. However the fundamental meaning, that of an overall ratio higher than the ratio for maximum speed, still applies.<ref name=\"Setright, Anatomy of the Motor Car, Overdrive\" /> Although the deliberate labelling of an overdrive is now rare, the underlying feature is now found across all cars.\n\n==Description==\n===Background===\nThe power needed to propel a car at any given set of conditions and speed is straightforward to calculate, based primarily on the total weight and the vehicle's speed. These produce two primary forces slowing the car, [[rolling resistance]], and [[Drag (physics)|air drag]]. The former varies roughly with the speed of the vehicle, while the latter varies with the square of the speed. Calculating these from first principles is generally difficult due to a variety of real-world factors, so this is often measured directly in [[wind tunnel]]s and similar systems.\n\nThe power produced by an engine increases with the engine's RPM to a maximum, then falls away. This is known as the [[power band|point of maximum power]]. Given a curve describing the overall drag on the vehicle, it is simple to find the speed at which the total drag forces are the same as the maximum power of the engine. This defines the maximum speed the vehicle is able to reach. The rotational speed of the wheels for that given forward speed is simple to calculate, it is simply the tyre circumference times the RPM.<ref group=N> For instance, a 15-inch wheel with 215/65 tyres has a diameter of about 26 inches, or a circumference of about 82 inches. At 100 mph, or 1760 inches per second, the wheel will be turning 21.5 times per second, or just under 1,300 RPM.</ref> As the tire RPM at maximum speed is not the same as the engine RPM at that power, a [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] is used with a gear ratio to convert one to the other.<ref name=\"Setright, Anatomy of the Motor Car, Overdrive\" /><ref group=N>Using the example above, at 100 mph the engine might need to be turning 5,000 RPM to generate the required power to turn the tyres at 1,300 RPM. A transmission with a gear ratio of 4:1 would be appropriate in this case.</ref>\n\nAt even slightly lower speeds than maximum, the total drag on the vehicle is considerably less, and the engine needs to deliver this greatly reduced amount of power. In this case the RPM of the engine has changed significantly while the RPM of the wheels has changed very little. Clearly this condition calls for a different gear ratio. If one is not supplied, the engine is forced to run at a higher RPM than optimal. As the engine requires more power to overcome internal friction at higher RPM, this means more fuel is used simply to keep the engine running at this speed. Every cycle of the engine leads to wear, so keeping the engine at higher RPM is also unfavorable for engine life. Additionally, the sound of an engine is strongly related to the RPM, so running at lower RPM is generally quieter.<ref name=\"Setright, Anatomy of the Motor Car, Overdrive\" />\n\nIf one runs the same RPM transmission exercise outlined above for maximum speed, but instead sets the \"maximum speed\" to that of highway cruising, the output is a higher gear ratio that provides ideal fuel mileage. In an era when cars were not able to travel very fast, the maximum power point might be near enough to the desired speed that additional gears were not needed. But as more powerful cars appeared, especially during the 1960s, this disparity between the maximum power point and desired speed grew considerably. This meant that cars were often operating far from their most efficient point. As the desire for better [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] grew, especially after the [[1973 oil crisis]], the need for a \"cruising gear\" became more pressing.<ref name=\"Setright, Anatomy of the Motor Car, Overdrive\" />\n\n===Gearbox vs. final drive===\nThe obvious solution to this problem would be to add more gears to the transmission. Indeed, in modern vehicles this is common. However, due to historical particularities, this was not always practical.\n\nIn the conventional [[Front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout|rear-wheel drive layout]], the transmission system normally contained two sections, the \"gearbox\" or \"transmission\" mounted behind the engine, and the \"final drive\" mounted in the [[rear axle]] at the rear of the car. The reason for this separation of duties between the front and back of the car was to allow the [[drive shaft]] to run at lower torque, by using higher RPM. As power is the product of RPM and [[torque]], running the shaft at higher RPM allowed more power to be transferred at lower torque. Doing so reduced the torque the driveshaft had to carry, and thus the strength and weight it required.\n\nAlthough the designer was theoretically free to choose any ratio for the gearbox and final drive, there is one additional consideration which meant that the top gear of most gearboxes was 1:1 or \"direct drive\". This is chosen for efficiency, as it does not require any gears to transmit power and so reduces the power lost by them. This was particularly important in the early days of cars, as their straight-cut gears were poorly finished, noisy and inefficient. The final drive then took this output and adjusted it in a fixed-ratio transmission arrangement that was much simpler to build. Final drive ratios of 4:1 were common,<ref group=N>This ratio varies between cars, from around 3.5:1 to 5:1. American cars with large-slow-revving engines would use higher ratios, European compact cars with small high-revving engines were lower. Often the final drive ratio varied between models within a range, a \"sports\" model having a lower ratio.</ref> meaning that the wheels would turn at one fourth the rate they would if directly connected to the engine.\n\n===Overdrive===\nIn an era when different models of car with different wheel sizes could be accommodated by simply changing the final drive ratio, it made sense for all transmissions to use direct drive as the highest gear. As noted earlier, however, this would cause the engine to operate at too high an RPM for efficient cruising. Although adding the cruising gear to the main gearbox was possible, it was generally simpler to add a separate two-gear overdrive system to the existing gearbox. This not only meant that it could be tuned for different vehicles, but had the additional advantage that it could be offered as an easily installed option.\n\nWith the use of front-wheel drive layouts, the gearbox and final drive are combined into a single transaxle. There is no longer a drive shaft between them and so the notion of \"direct drive\" isn't applicable. Although \"overdrive\" is still referred to, this is now mostly a marketing term to refer to any extra-high ratio for efficient cruising, whether it is achieved through the gearbox ratios, or by an unusually high final drive.<ref group=N>Small Volkswagens of the 1980s, such as the [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]], were marketed to an environmentally-conscious market with an overdrive top ratio labelled on the gear shift as \"E\", variously described as \"Efficiency\", \"Economy\" or \"Environment\".</ref>\n\n== Usage ==\nGenerally speaking, overdrive is the highest gear in the transmission. Overdrive allows the engine to operate at a lower RPM for a given road speed. This allows the vehicle to achieve better fuel efficiency, and often quieter operation on the highway. When it is switched on, an automatic transmission can shift into overdrive mode after a certain speed is reached (usually 70+ km/h [40-45&nbsp;mph or more] depending on the load). When it is off, the automatic transmission shifting is limited to the lower gears. Overdrive should usually be selected when the average speed is above 70&nbsp;km/h (40-45&nbsp;mph).\n\nThe automatic transmission automatically shifts from OD to direct drive when more load is present. When less load is present, it shifts back to OD. Under certain conditions, for example driving uphill, or towing a trailer, the transmission may \"hunt\" between OD and the next highest gear, shifting back and forth. In this case, switching it off can help the transmission to \"decide\". It may also be advantageous to switch it off if [[engine braking]] is desired, for example when driving downhill. The vehicle's owner's manual will often contain information and suitable procedures regarding such situations, for each given vehicle.\n\nVirtually all vehicles (cars and trucks) have overdrive today whether manual transmission or automatic. In the automotive aftermarket you can also retrofit overdrive to existing early transmissions. Overdrive was widely used in European automobiles with manual transmission in the 60s and 70s to improve mileage and sport driving as a bolt-on option but it became increasingly more common for later transmissions to have this gear built in. If a vehicle is equipped with a bolt-on overdrive (e.g.: GKN or Gear Vendors) as opposed to having an overdrive built in one will typically have the option to use the overdrive in more gears than just the top gear. In this case gear changing is still possible in all gears, even with overdrive disconnected. Overdrive simply adds effective ranges to the gears, thus overdrive third and fourth become in effect \"third-and-a-half\" and a fifth gear. In practice this gives the driver more ratios which are closer together providing greater flexibility particularly in performance cars.\n\n== How an overdrive unit works ==\nThe overdrive consists of an electrically or hydraulically operated [[epicyclic gearing|epicyclic gear]] train bolted behind the [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] unit. It can either couple the input [[driveshaft]] directly to the output shaft (or [[propeller shaft]]) (1:1), or increase the output speed so that it turns faster than the input shaft (1:1&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n''). Thus the output shaft may be \"overdriven\" relative to the input shaft. In newer transmissions, the overdrive speed(s) are typically as a result of combinations of planetary/epicyclic gearsets which are integrated in the transmission. In these cases, there is no separately identifiable \"overdrive\" unit. In older vehicles, it is sometimes actuated by a knob or button, often incorporated into the gearshift knob, and does not require operation of the [[clutch]]. Newer vehicles have electronic overdrive in which the computer automatically adjusts to the conditions of power need and load.\n\n== In Europe ==\nThe vast majority of overdrives in [[Europe]]an cars were invented and developed by a man called de Normanville and manufactured by an [[United Kingdom|English]] company called [[Laycock Engineering]] (later GKN Laycock), at its Little London Road site in Sheffield. The buildings are now demolished and the overdrives are remanufactured in the UK by an ex-Laycock de Normanville employee trading as Overdrive Spares.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odspares.com/ |title=ODspares.com |publisher=ODspares.com |date=2011-09-11 |accessdate=2011-09-17}}</ref> The system was devised by [[Edgar de Normanville|Captain Edgar J de Normanville (1882\u20131968)]],<ref name=Motor1968 >{{cite magazine| authorlink = Michael Bowler| title = Obituary: E,J.de Normanville|magazine= Motor| volume =| page =112 |date = 27 January 1968}}</ref> and made by Laycock through a chance meeting with a Laycock Products Engineer. De Normanville overdrives were found in vehicles manufactured by [[Standard-Triumph]], who were first, followed by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[British Leyland|BMC and British Leyland]], [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]], [[Rootes Group]] and [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]] to name only a few. Another British company, the former aircraft builder [[Fairey Aviation Company|Fairey]], built a successful all-mechanical unit for the [[Land Rover]], which is still in production in America today.\n\nThe first production vehicle to feature the Laycock system was the 1948 Standard Vanguard Saloon. The first unit to be created was the A-type overdrive, which was fitted to many sports cars during the 1950s, and into the late 1960s. Several famous marques used A-type overdrives, including Jaguar, Aston Martin, Ferrari, Austin-Healey, Jensen, Bristol, AC, Armstrong Siddeley and Triumph's Vanguard-powered TR sports car range, until the end of TR5 & TR250 production in 1969.\n\nIn 1959, the Laycock Engineering Company introduced the D-type overdrive, which was fitted to a variety of motor cars including [[Volvo 120]] and [[Volvo 1800|1800s]], [[Sunbeam Alpine]]s and [[Sunbeam Rapier|Rapiers]], [[Triumph Spitfire]]s, and also 1962-1967 [[MG MGB|MGB]]s (those with 3-synchro transmissions).\n\nFrom 1967 the LH-type overdrive was introduced, and this featured in a variety of models, including 1968\u20131980 [[MG MGB|MGB]]s, the [[MG MGC|MGC]], the [[Ford Zephyr]], early [[Reliant Scimitar]]s, TVRs, and [[Gilbern]]s.\n\nThe J-type overdrive was introduced in the late 1960s, and was adapted to fit Volvo, Triumph, Vauxhall/Opel, American Motors and Chrysler motorcars, and [[Ford Transit]] vans.\n\nThe P-type overdrive marked the last updates and included both a Gear Vendors U.S. version and a Volvo version. The Volvo version kept the same package size as the J-type but with the updated 18 element [[freewheel]] and stronger splines through the planet carrier. The Gear Vendors U.S. version uses a larger 1.375 outer diameter output shaft for higher capacity and a longer rear case.\n\nOver a period of 40 years, [[Laycock Engineering]] manufactured over three and a half million overdrive Units, and over one million of these were fitted to Volvo motorcars.\n\nIn 2008 the U.S. company Gear Vendors, Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gearvendors.com/ |title=gearvendors.com |publisher=gearvendors.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-17}}</ref> of [[El Cajon, California]] purchased all the overdrive assets of GKN to continue production of the U.S. version and all spares for J and P types worldwide.\n\nThe system features an oil pressure operated device attached to the back of the standard gearbox operating on the gearbox output shaft. Through a system of oil pressure, solenoids and pistons, the overdrive would drop the revs on whatever gears it was used on by 22% (.778). For instance, the overdrive system applied to a [[Triumph TR5]] operates on 2nd, 3rd and top gear. When engaged, the overdrive would drop the revs from 3000 by 666 RPM, or from 3500 the drop would be 777 RPM to 2723 net. The advantages this reduced rpm had on fuel consumption was most often quite near 22% decrease during highway driving.\n\n== In North America ==\nIn the days before automatic transmissions were common, especially in the 1950s, many [[rear-wheel drive]] American cars were available with an overdrive option. [[Borg Warner]] provided the box that was factory-installed between the transmission and a foreshortened driveshaft. Since the overdrive function, if enabled, could be shifted by simply easing up on the accelerator without depressing the [[clutch pedal]], the action was much like a semi-automatic. Also, an electrically operated solenoid would deactivate the unit via a switch under the accelerator pedal providing the equivalent of the [[Automatic transmission#Manually controlled automatic transmissions|kickdown]] of the automatic. A knob connected to a [[bowden cable]], similar to some emergency brake applications, was also provided to lock out the unit mechanically. Using overdrive with the main 3-speed transmission in 2nd gear was similar in ratio to 3rd gear, and with the main transmission in 3rd, the overall ratio was fractional (i.e., \"true overdrive\").\n\nSuch add-on overdrive boxes were available from the 1930s to the 1970s for cars and light trucks.\n\nToday, most petrol and diesel cars and trucks come with an overdrive transmission because of the benefit to fuel economy.{{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion. I thought many (most?) current vehicles have a 1:1 final transmission ratio, which is not overdrive|date=March 2010}} Overdrive is included in both automatic and manual transmissions as an extra gear (or two in some cases).\n\n== Fuel economy and drivetrain wear ==\nWhen using overdrive gearing, the car's engine speed drops, reducing wear and normally saving fuel. Since 1981 U.S. [[corporate average fuel economy]] (CAFE) legislation, virtually all domestic vehicles have included overdrive to save fuel. One should refer to the car's owner's manual for the proper speed to run at overdrive. All engines have a range of peak efficiency and it is possible for the use of overdrive to keep the engine out of this range for all or part of the time of its use if used at inappropriate speeds, thus cutting into any fuel savings from the lower engine speed.\n\nOverall drivetrain reduction comes down to three basic factors: transmission gearing (including overdrive), differential gearing (in the axle), and tire size. The rotation speed problem comes into effect when the differential gearing is a high ratio and an overdrive is used to compensate. This may create unpleasant vibrations at high speeds and possible destruction of the driveshaft due to the centripetal forces or uneven balance.\n\nThe driveshaft is usually a hollow metal tube that requires balancing to reduce vibration and contains no internal bracing.\n\nThe higher speeds on the driveshaft and related parts can cause heat and wear problems if an overdrive and high differential gearing (or even very small tires) are combined, and create unnecessary friction. This is especially important because the differential gears are bathed in heavy oil and seldom provided with any cooling besides air blowing over the housing.\n\nThe impetus is to minimize overdrive use and provide a higher ratio first gear, which means more gears between the first and the last to keep the engine at its most efficient speed. This is part of the reason that modern automobiles tend to have larger numbers of gears in their transmissions. It is also why more than one overdrive gear is seldom seen in a vehicle except in special circumstances i.e. where high (numerical) differential gear is required to get the vehicle moving as in trucks or performance cars though double overdrive transmissions are common in other vehicles, often with a small number on the axle gear reduction, but usually only engage at speeds exceeding {{convert|100|km/h|mph|-1}}.\n\n== References ==\n;Notes\n{{reflist|group=N}}\n\n;Citations\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Overdrives}}\n*[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/automatic-transmission8.htm \"How Automatic Transmissions Work \u2013 Overdrive\"] (with a [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]] [[interactive]] [[animation]])\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Overdrive (Mechanics)}}\n[[Category:Automotive transmission technologies]]"}]}}}}
