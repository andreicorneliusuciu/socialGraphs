The package may be [[through-hole technology|through-hole mounted]] to a [[printed circuit board]] or inserted in a socket. The dual-inline format was invented by Don Forbes, Rex Rice and Bryant Rogers at Fairchild R&D in 1964,<ref>Dummer, G.W.A. ''Electronic Inventions and Discoveries'' (2nd ed)., Pergamon Press, ISBN 0-08-022730-9 </ref> when the restricted number of leads available on circular transistor-style packages became a limitation in the use of [[integrated circuit]]s.<ref>Jackson, Kenneth.A.; Schr\u00f6ter, Wolfgang ''Handbook of Semiconductor Technology'', John Wiley & Sons, 2000 ISBN 3-527-29835-5 page 610 </ref> Over the years increasingly complex circuits required more signal and power supply leads (as observed in [[Rent's rule]]); eventually microprocessors and similar complex devices required more leads than could be put on a DIP package, leading to development of higher-density packages.  Furthermore, square and rectangular packages made it easier to route printed-circuit traces beneath the packages. E.g. the increasing [[data bus]] and [[address bus]], of CPUs, over the years with increasing bitness, meant more signals; This is however not a strict requirement for external pins, as memory can all be internal as with [[microcontroller]]s what are available as 6-pin (for 8-bit) and 8-pin (for 32-bit; e.g. ARM) microcontrollers. All microcontrollers had more pins when RAM wasn't onchip.\n\nA DIP is usually referred to as a '''DIP''n''''', where ''n'' is the total number of pins. For example, a microcircuit package with two rows of seven vertical leads would be a DIP14. The photograph at the upper right shows three DIP14 ICs. Common packages have as few as four and as many as 64 leads. Many analog and digital integrated circuit types are available in DIP packages, as are arrays of transistors, switches, light emitting diodes, and resistors. DIP plugs for ribbon cables can be used with standard IC sockets.\n\nDIP packages are usually made from an opaque molded epoxy plastic pressed around a tin-, silver-, or gold-plated [[lead frame]] that supports the device die and provides connection pins. Some types of IC are made in ceramic DIP packages, where high temperature or high reliability is required, or where the device has an optical window to the interior of the package. Most DIP packages are secured to a [[printed circuit board]] by inserting the pins through holes in the board and soldering them in place. Where replacement of the parts is necessary, such as in test fixtures or where programmable devices must be removed for changes, a DIP socket is used. Some sockets include a [[zero insertion force]] mechanism.\n\nVariations of the DIP package include those with only a single row of pins, possibly including a heat sink tab in place of the second row of pins, and types with four rows of pins, two rows, staggered, on each side of the package. DIP packages have been mostly displaced by surface-mount package types, which avoid the expense of drilling holes in a printed circuit board and which allow higher density of interconnections.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Types of devices===\n[[File:Breadboard counter.jpg|thumb|An operating prototyped circuit [[breadboard]] incorporating four DIP ICs, a DIP LED bargraph display (upper left), and a DIP 7-segment LED display (lower left).]]\n\nDIPs are commonly used for [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs). Other devices in DIP packages include resistor networks, [[DIP switch]]es, [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] [[segmented display|segmented]] and bargraph displays, and electromechanical [[relay]]s.\n\nDIP connector plugs for ribbon cables are common in computers and other electronic equipment.\n\nDallas Semiconductor manufactured integrated DIP real-time clock (RTC) modules which contained an IC chip and a non-replaceable 10-year lithium battery.\n\nDIP header blocks on to which discrete components could be soldered were used where groups of components needed to be easily removed, for configuration changes, optional features or calibration.\n\n===Uses===\nThe original dual-in-line package was invented by Bryant \"Buck\" Rogers in 1964 while working for [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]. The first devices had 14 pins and looked much like they do today.<ref>Dummer, G.W.A. ''Electronic Inventions and Discoveries'' 2nd ed. Pergamon Press ISBN 0-08-022730-9</ref> The rectangular shape allowed integrated circuits to be packaged more densely than previous round packages.<ref>[http://www.computerhistory.org/semiconductor/timeline/1965-Package.html Computer Museum retrieved April 16, 2008]</ref> The package was well-suited to automated assembly equipment; a printed circuit board could be populated with scores or hundreds of ICs, then all the components on the circuit board could be soldered at one time on a [[wave soldering]] machine and passed on to automated testing machines, with very little human labor required. DIP packages were still large with respect to the integrated circuits within them. By the end of the 20th century, [[surface-mount technology|surface-mount]] packages allowed further reduction in the size and weight of systems. DIP chips are still popular for circuit prototyping on a [[breadboard]] because of how easily they can be inserted and utilized there.\n\nDIPs were the mainstream of the microelectronics industry in the 1970s and 80s. Their use has declined in the first decade of the 21st century due to the emerging new [[surface-mount technology]] (SMT) packages such as [[plastic leaded chip carrier]] (PLCC) and [[small-outline integrated circuit]] (SOIC), though DIPs continued in extensive use through the 1990s, and still continue to be used substantially as the year 2011 passes. Because some modern chips are available only in surface-mount package types, a number of companies sell various prototyping adapters to allow those SMT devices to be used like DIP devices with through-hole breadboards and soldered prototyping boards (such as [[stripboard]] and [[perfboard]]). (SMT can pose quite a problem, at least an inconvenience, for prototyping in general; most of the characteristics of SMT that are advantages for mass production are difficulties for prototyping.)\n\nFor programmable devices like [[EPROM]]s and [[Generic array logic|GAL]]s, DIPs remained popular for many years due to their easy handling with external programming circuitry (i.e., the DIP devices could be simply plugged into a socket on the programming device.) However, with [[In-System Programming]] (ISP) technology now state of the art, this advantage of DIPs is rapidly losing importance as well.\n\nThrough the 1990s, devices with fewer than 20 leads were manufactured in a DIP format in addition to the newer formats. Since about 2000, newer devices are often unavailable in the DIP format.\n\n===Mounting===\nDIPs can be mounted either by [[through-hole technology|through-hole soldering]] or in sockets. Sockets allow easy replacement of a device and eliminates the risk of damage from overheating during soldering. Generally sockets were used for high-value or large ICs, which cost much more than the socket. Where devices would be frequently inserted and removed, such as in test equipment or EPROM programmers, a [[zero insertion force]] socket would be used.\n\nDIPs are also used with breadboards, a temporary mounting arrangement for education, design development or device testing. Some hobbyists, for one-off construction or permanent prototyping, use [[point-to-point construction#'Dead bug' construction|point-to-point]] wiring with DIPs, and their appearance when physically inverted as part of this method inspires the informal term \"dead bug style\" for the method.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:DIP Cross-section.svg|thumb|Side view of a dual in-line package (DIP) IC]]\nThe body (housing) of a DIP containing an IC chip is usually made from molded plastic or ceramic. The hermetic nature of a ceramic housing is preferred for extremely high reliability devices. However, the vast majority of DIPs are manufactured via a thermoset molding process in which an epoxy mold compound is heated and transferred under pressure to encapsulate the device. Typical cure cycles for the resins are less than 2 minutes and a single cycle may produce hundreds of devices.\n\nThe leads emerge from the longer sides of the package along the seam, parallel to the top and bottom planes of the package, and are bent downward approximately 90 degrees (or slightly less, leaving them angled slightly outward from the centerline of the package body.) (The [[Small-outline integrated circuit|SOIC]], the SMT package that most resembles a typical DIP, appears essentially the same, notwithstanding size scale, except that after being bent down the leads are bent upward again by an equal angle to become parallel with the bottom plane of the package.) In ceramic (CERDIP) packages, an epoxy or grout is used to hermetically seal the two halves together, providing an [[air]] and [[moisture]] tight seal to protect the IC [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] inside. Plastic DIP (PDIP) packages are usually sealed by fusing or cementing the plastic halves around the leads, but a high degree of [[hermeticity]] is not achieved because the plastic itself is usually somewhat porous to moisture and the process cannot ensure a good microscopic seal between the leads and the plastic at all points around the perimeter. However, contaminants are usually still kept out well enough that the device can operate reliably for decades with reasonable care in a controlled environment.\n\nInside the package, the lower half has the leads embedded, and at the center of the package is a rectangular space, chamber, or void into which the IC die is cemented. The leads of the package extend diagonally inside the package from their positions of emergence along the periphery to points along a rectangular perimeter surrounding the die, tapering as they go to become fine contacts at the die. Ultra-fine [[bond wire]]s (barely visible to the naked human eye) are welded between these die periphery contacts and bond pads on the die itself, connecting one lead to each bond pad, and making the final connection between the microcircuits and the external DIP leads. The bond wires are not usually taut but loop upward slightly to allow slack for thermal expansion and contraction of the materials; if a single bond wire breaks or detaches, the entire IC may become useless. The top of the package covers all of this delicate assemblage without crushing the bond wires, protecting it from contamination by foreign materials.\n\nUsually, a company logo, alphanumeric codes and sometimes words are printed on top of the package to identify its manufacturer and type, when it was made (usually as a year and a week number), sometimes where it was made, and other proprietary information (perhaps revision numbers, manufacturing plant codes, or stepping ID codes.)\n\nThe necessity of laying out all of the leads in a basically radial pattern in a single plane from the die perimeter to two rows on the periphery of the package is the main reason that DIP packages with higher lead counts must have wider spacing between the lead rows, and it effectively limits the number of leads which a practical DIP package may have. Even for a very small die with many bond pads (e.g. a chip with 15 inverters, requiring 32 leads), a wider DIP would still be required to accommodate the radiating leads internally. This is one of the reasons that four-sided and multiple rowed packages, such as PGAs, were introduced (around the early 1980s.)\n\nA large DIP package (such as the DIP64 used for the [[Motorola 68000]] CPU) has long leads inside the package between pins and the die, making such a package unsuitable for high speed devices.\n\nSome other types of DIP devices are built very differently. Most of these have molded plastic housings and straight leads or leads that extend directly out of the bottom of the package. For some, LED displays particularly, the housing is usually a hollow plastic box with the bottom/back open, filled (around the contained electronic components) with a hard translucent epoxy material from which the leads emerge. Others, such as DIP switches, are composed of two (or more) plastic housing parts snapped, welded, or glued together around a set of contacts and tiny mechanical parts, with the leads emerging through molded-in holes or notches in the plastic.\n\n===Variants===\n\n[[Image:Nec8080.png|right|thumb|Several PDIPs and CERDIPs. The large CERDIP in the foreground is an NEC 8080AF ([[Intel 8080]]-compatible) microprocessor.]]\n\nSeveral DIP variants for ICs exist, mostly distinguished by packaging material:\n\n* '''Ceramic Dual In-line Package (CERDIP or CDIP)'''\n* '''Plastic Dual In-line Package (PDIP)'''\n* '''Shrink Plastic Dual In-line Package (SPDIP)''' &ndash; A denser version of the PDIP with a 0.07 in. (1.778&nbsp;mm) lead pitch.\n* '''Skinny Dual In-line Package (SDIP or SPDIP<ref>For instance, Microchip: http://www.microchip.com/packaging</ref>)''' &ndash; Sometimes used to refer to a \"narrow\" 0.300 in. (or 300 [[Thousandth of an inch|mil]]) wide DIP, normally when clarification is needed e.g. for DIP with 24 pins or more, which usually come in \"wide\" 0.600 in. wide DIP package. An example of a typical proper full spec for a \"narrow\" DIP package would be 300 mil body width, 0.1\" pin pitch.\n\n[[EPROM]]s were sold in ceramic DIPs manufactured with a circular window of clear quartz over the chip die to allow the part to be erased by ultraviolet light. Often, the same chips were also sold in less expensive windowless PDIP or CERDIP packages as [[EPROM#Details|one-time programmable]] (OTP) versions. Windowed and windowless packages were also used for microcontrollers, and other devices, containing EPROM memory. Windowed CERDIP-packaged EPROMs were used for the [[BIOS]] ROM of many early IBM PC clones with an adhesive label covering the window to prevent inadvertent erasure through exposure to ambient light.\n\nMolded plastic DIPs are much lower in cost than ceramic packages; one 1979 study showed that a plastic 14 pin DIP cost around US 63 cents, and a ceramic package cost 82 cents.<ref>Rao R.

It is not as popular as the DIP, but has been used for packaging [[RAM]] chips and multiple resistors with a common pin. SIPs group RAM chips together on a small board either by the DIP process or [[Surface-mount technology|surface mounting]] SMD process. The board itself has a single row of pin-leads that resembles a comb extending from its bottom edge, which plug into a special socket on a system or system-expansion board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birds-eye.net/definition/acronym/?id=1154212150 |accessdate=December 27, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928162904/http://www.birds-eye.net/definition/acronym/?id=1154212150 |archivedate=September 28, 2011 }}</ref> SIPs are commonly found in [[memory module]]s.

This [[multi-leaded power package]] is useful for such applications as audio power amplifiers, for example.\n\n===Quad in-line===\n[[File:R6511.jpg|thumb|A Rockwell 6502-based microcontroller in a QIP package]]\n\nRockwell used a '''quad in-line package''' with 42 leads formed into staggered rows for their PPS-4 microprocessor family introduced in 1973,\n<ref>{{Citation|title=Data Sheet: Parallel Processing System (PPC-4) Microcomputer|date=1973|url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/rockwell/PPS-4/PPS-4_Data_Sheet_1974.pdf|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}</ref>\nand other microprocessors and microcontrollers, some with higher lead counts, through the early 1990s.\n\nThe QIP, sometimes called a '''QIL''' package, has the same dimensions as a DIL package, but the leads on each side are bent into an alternating zigzag configuration so as to fit four lines of solder pads (instead of two with a DIL). The QIL design increased the spacing between solder pads without increasing package size, for two reasons:\n\n# First it allowed more reliable [[soldering]]. This may seem odd today, given the far closer solder pad spacing in use now, but in the 1970s, the heyday of the QIL, [[solder bridge|bridging]] of neighbouring solder pads on DIL chips was an issue at times,\n# QIL also increased the possibility of running a [[copper]] track between 2 solder pads. This was very handy on the then standard single sided single layer [[Printed circuit board|PCBs]].\n\nSome QIL packaged ICs had added [[heatsink]]ing tabs, such as the [http://lamson.dnsdojo.com/LAMSON%20ALL%20PARTS%20PICTURE/HA%20HITACHI%20IC/HA1306W.JPG HA1306.]\n\n[[Intel]] and [[3M]] developed the ceramic leadless '''quad in-line package''' ('''QUIP'''), introduced in 1979, to boost microprocessor density and economy.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hj4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22#v=onepage&q&f=false Intel & 3M Develop Package to Boost Microprocessor Density & Economy], ''Intelligent Machines Journal'', March 14, 1979</ref>  The ceramic leadless QUIP is not designed for surface-mount use, and requires a socket.  It was used by Intel for the [[Intel iAPX 432|iAPX 432]] microprocessor chip set, and by [[Zilog]] for the Z8-02 external-ROM prototyping version of the [[Zilog Z8|Z8]] microcontroller.\n\n===Lead count and spacing===\n\nCommonly found DIP packages that conform to [[JEDEC]] standards use an inter-lead spacing (lead pitch) of 0.1&nbsp;inch (2.54&nbsp;mm). Row spacing varies depending on lead counts, with 0.3 in. (7.62&nbsp;mm)(JEDEC MS-001) or 0.6&nbsp;inch (15.24&nbsp;mm)(JEDEC MS-011) the most common. Less common standardized row spacings include 0.4&nbsp;inch (10.16&nbsp;mm)(JEDEC MS-010) and 0.9&nbsp;inch (22.86&nbsp;mm), as well as a row spacing of 0.3&nbsp;inch, 0.6&nbsp;inch or 0.75&nbsp;inch with a 0.07&nbsp;inch (1.778&nbsp;mm) lead pitch.\n\nThe former Soviet Union and Eastern bloc countries used similar packages, but with a metric inter-lead spacing of 2.5&nbsp;mm rather than 2.54&nbsp;mm (0.1&nbsp;inch).\n\nThe number of leads is always even. For 0.3&nbsp;inch spacing, typical lead counts are 8, 14, 16, 18, and 28; less common are 4, 6, 20, and 24 lead counts. For 0.6&nbsp;inch spacing, typical lead counts are 24, 28, 32, and 40; less common are 36, 48, 52, and 64 lead counts. Some microprocessors, such as the [[Motorola 68000]] and [[Zilog Z180]], used lead counts as high as 64; this is typically the maximum number of leads for a DIP package.<ref name=\"CMOS_DI\">{{cite book |title=CMOS digital integrated circuits (3rd Edition) |last=Kang |first=Sung-Mo |author2=Leblebici, Yusuf |year=2002 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-246053-9 |page=42}}</ref>\n\n==Orientation and lead numbering==\n[[Image:Pin numbering 01 Pengo.svg|thumb|right|Pin numbering is counter-clockwise]]\n\nAs shown in the diagram, leads are numbered consecutively from Pin 1. When the identifying notch in the package is at the top, Pin 1 is the top left corner of the device. Sometimes Pin 1 is identified with an indent or paint dot mark.\n\nFor example, for a 14-lead DIP, with the notch at the top, the left leads are numbered from 1 to 7 (top to bottom) and the right row of leads are numbered 8 to 14 (bottom to top).\n\nSome DIP devices, such as [[segment display|segmented LED display]]s, relays, or those that replace leads with a heat sink fin, skip some leads; the remaining leads are numbered as if all positions had leads.\n\nIn addition to providing for human visual identification of the orientation of the package, the notch allows automated chip-insertion machinery to confirm correct orientation of the chip by mechanical sensing.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n==Descendants==\nThe [[Small-outline integrated circuit|SOIC]] (Small Outline IC), a surface-mount package which is currently very popular, particularly in consumer electronics and personal computers, is essentially a shrunk version of the standard IC PDIP, the fundamental difference which makes it an SMT device being a second bend in the leads to flatten them parallel to the bottom plane of the plastic housing. The SOJ (Small Outline J-lead) and other SMT packages with \"SOP\" (for \"Small Outline Package\") in their names can be considered further relatives of the DIP, their original ancestor. SOIC packages tend to have half the pitch of DIP, and SOP are half that, a fourth of DIP. (0.1\"/2.54&nbsp;mm, 0.05\"/1.27&nbsp;mm, and 0.025\"/0.635&nbsp;mm, respectively)\n\n[[Pin grid array]] (PGA) packages may be considered to have evolved from the DIP. PGAs with the same 0.1&nbsp;inch pin centers as most DIPs were popular for microprocessors from the early to mid-1980s through the 1990s. Owners of personal computers containing Intel [[80286]] through [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] processors may be most familiar with these PGA packages, which were often inserted into [[Zero Insertion Force|ZIF]] sockets on [[motherboard]]s. The similarity is such that a PGA socket may be physically compatible with some DIP devices, though the converse is rarely true.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chip carrier]]\n* [[DIP switch]]\n* [[Flatpack (electronics)]]\n* [[Pin grid array]]\n* [[QFP]]\n* [[Zig-zag in-line package]]\n* [[List of integrated circuit package dimensions]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |title=Packaging |last=Intel |year=1996 |publisher=Mcgraw-hill Inc |isbn=1-55512-254-X}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Dual inline packages}}\n* [http://chippackage.tecnoface.com/?d=DIP-Dual-in-line&show=ct&ct=dip DIP packages documentation, photos and videos]\n{{FS1037C}}\n\n{{Semiconductor packages}}\n{{Early CPU sockets}}\n\n[[Category:Chip carriers]]\n[[Category:CPU sockets]]"}]}}}}
