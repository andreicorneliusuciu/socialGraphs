Chebyshev filters have the property that they minimize the error between the idealized and the actual filter characteristic over the range of the filter,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} but with ripples in the passband.\nThis type of filter is named after [[Pafnuty Chebyshev]] because its mathematical characteristics are derived from [[Chebyshev polynomials]].\n\nBecause of the passband ripple inherent in Chebyshev filters, the ones that have a smoother response in the passband but a more irregular response in the stopband are preferred for some applications.\n\n== Type I Chebyshev filters ==\n[[File:Chebyshev Type I Filter Response (4th Order).svg|thumb|350px|The frequency response of a fourth-order type I Chebyshev low-pass filter with <math>\\varepsilon=1</math>]]\n\nType I Chebyshev filters are the most common types of Chebyshev filters. The gain (or [[amplitude]]) response, <math>G_n(\\omega)</math>, as a function of angular frequency <math>\\omega</math> of the ''n''th-order low-pass filter is equal to the absolute value of the transfer function <math>H_n(s)</math> evaluated at <math>s=j \\omega</math>:\n\n:<math>G_n(\\omega) = \\left | H_n(j \\omega) \\right | = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\varepsilon^2 T_n^2\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_0}\\right)}}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\varepsilon</math> is the ripple factor, <math>\\omega_0</math> is the [[cutoff frequency]] and <math>T_n</math> is a [[Chebyshev polynomial]] of the <math>n</math>th order.\n\nThe passband exhibits equiripple behavior, with the ripple determined by the ripple factor <math>\\varepsilon</math>. In the passband, the Chebyshev polynomial alternates between -1 and 1 so the filter gain alternate between maxima at ''G'' = 1 and minima at <math>G=1/\\sqrt{1+\\varepsilon^2}</math>. \n\nThe ripple factor \u03b5 is thus related to the passband ripple \u03b4 in [[decibel]]s by:\n\n:<math>\\varepsilon = \\sqrt{10^{0.1\\delta}-1}.</math>\n\nAt the cutoff frequency <math>\\omega_0</math> the gain again has the value <math>1/\\sqrt{1+\\varepsilon^2}</math> but continues to drop into the [[stopband]] as the frequency increases. This behavior is shown in the diagram on the right. The common practice of defining the cutoff frequency at \u22123 [[decibel|dB]] is usually not applied to Chebyshev filters; instead the cutoff is taken as the point at which the gain falls to the value of the ripple for the final time.\n\nThe 3&nbsp;dB frequency ''\u03c9''<sub>H</sub> is related to ''\u03c9''<sub>0</sub> by:\n\n:<math>\\omega_H = \\omega_0 \\cosh \\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\cosh^{-1}\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right).</math>\n\nThe order of a Chebyshev filter is equal to the number of [[Reactance (electronics)|reactive]] components (for example, [[inductor]]s) needed to realize the filter using [[analog electronics]].\n\nAn even steeper [[roll-off]] can be obtained if ripple is allowed in the stopband, by allowing zeroes on the <math>j\\omega</math>-axis in the complex plane. However, this results in less suppression in the stopband. The result is called an [[elliptic filter]], also known as Cauer filter.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Poles and zeroes ===\n[[File:Chebyshev Type I Filter s-Plane Response (8th Order).svg|right|thumb|300px|Log of the absolute value of the gain of an 8th order Chebyshev type I filter in [[complex frequency space]] (''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''&sigma;''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''j&omega;'') with &epsilon;&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.1 and <math>\\omega_0=1</math>.

The poles <math>(\\omega_{pm})</math> of the gain function of the Chebyshev filter are the zeroes of the denominator of the gain function. Using the complex frequency ''s'', these occur when:\n\n:<math>1+\\varepsilon^2T_n^2(-js)=0.\\,</math>\n\nDefining <math>-js=\\cos(\\theta)</math> and using the trigonometric definition of the Chebyshev polynomials yields:\n\n:<math>1+\\varepsilon^2T_n^2(\\cos(\\theta))=1+\\varepsilon^2\\cos^2(n\\theta)=0.\\,</math>\n\nSolving for <math>\\theta</math>\n\n:<math>\\theta=\\frac{1}{n}\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\pm j}{\\varepsilon}\\right)+\\frac{m\\pi}{n}</math>\n\nwhere the multiple values of the arc cosine function are made explicit using the integer index ''m''.

For each complex pole, there is another which is the complex conjugate, and for each conjugate pair there are two more that are the negatives of the pair. The [[transfer function]] must be stable, so that its poles are those of the gain that have negative real parts and therefore lie in the left half plane of complex frequency space. The transfer function is then given by\n\n:<math>H(s)= \\frac{1}{2^{n-1}\\varepsilon}\\ \\prod_{m=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{(s-s_{pm}^-)}</math>\n\nwhere <math>s_{pm}^-</math> are only those poles of the gain with a negative sign in front of the real term in the above equation for the poles.\n\n=== The group delay ===\n[[Image:Chebyshev5 GainDelay.png|300px|left|thumb|Gain and group delay of a fifth-order type I Chebyshev filter with &epsilon; = 0.5.]]\n\nThe [[group delay]] is defined as the derivative of the phase with respect to angular frequency and is a measure of the distortion in the signal introduced by phase differences for different frequencies.\n\n:<math>\\tau_g=-\\frac{d}{d\\omega}\\arg(H(j\\omega))</math>\n\nThe gain and the group delay for a fifth-order type I Chebyshev filter with \u03b5=0.5 are plotted in the graph on the left. It can be seen that there are ripples in the gain  and the group delay in the passband but not in the stopband.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Type II Chebyshev filters==\n[[Image:ChebyshevII response.png|thumb|350px|The frequency response of a fifth-order type II Chebyshev low-pass filter with <math>\\varepsilon=0.01</math>]]\n\nAlso known as inverse Chebyshev filters, the Type II Chebyshev filter type is less common because it does not roll off as fast as Type I, and requires more components. It has no ripple in the passband, but does have equiripple in the stopband.  The gain is:\n\n:<math>G_n(\\omega,\\omega_0) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+ \\frac{1} {\\varepsilon^2 T_n ^2 \\left ( \\omega_0 / \\omega \\right )}}}.</math>\n\nIn the stopband, the Chebyshev polynomial oscillates between -1 and 1 so that the gain will oscillate between zero and\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+ \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^2}}}</math>\n\nand the smallest frequency at which this maximum is attained is the cutoff frequency <math>\\omega_o</math>. The parameter \u03b5 is thus related to the [[stopband]] [[attenuation]] \u03b3 in [[decibel]]s by:\n\n:<math>\\varepsilon = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10^{0.1\\gamma}-1}}.</math>\n\nFor a stopband attenuation of 5&nbsp;dB, \u03b5 = 0.6801; for an attenuation of 10&nbsp;dB, \u03b5 = 0.3333. The frequency ''f''<sub>0</sub> = ''\u03c9''<sub>0</sub>/2''\u03c0'' is the cutoff frequency.  The 3&nbsp;dB frequency ''f''<sub>H</sub> is related to ''f''<sub>0</sub> by:\n\n:<math>f_H = \\frac{f_0}{\\cosh \\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\cosh^{-1}\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)}.</math>\n\n=== Poles and zeroes ===\n[[File:Chebyshev Type II Filter s-Plane Response (8th Order).svg|right|thumb|300px|Log of the absolute value of the gain of an 8th order Chebyshev type II filter in complex frequency space (s=&sigma;+j&omega;) with &epsilon; = 0.1 and <math>\\omega_0=1</math>. The white spots are poles and the black spots are zeroes. All 16 poles are shown. Each zero has multiplicity of two, and 12 zeroes are shown and four are located outside the picture, two on the positive &omega; axis, and two on the negative.

It can be seen that there are ripples in the gain in the stopband but not in the pass band.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Implementation ==\n\n=== Cauer topology ===\nA passive LC Chebyshev [[low-pass filter]] may be realized using a [[Cauer topology (electronics)|Cauer topology]]. The inductor or capacitor values of a nth-order Chebyshev [[prototype filter]] may be calculated from the following equations:<ref>Matthaei et. al 1980, p.99</ref>\n\n:<math>G_{0} = 1</math>\n\n:<math>G_{1} =\\frac{ 2 A_{1} }{ \\gamma }</math>\n\n:<math>G_{k} =\\frac{ 4 A_{k-1} A_{k} }{ B_{k-1}G_{k-1} },\\qquad k = 2,3,4,\\dots,n </math>\n\n:<math>G_{n+1} =\\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } n \\text{ odd} \\\\\n                                                   \\coth^{2} \\left ( \\frac{ \\beta }{ 4 } \\right ) & \\text{if } n \\text{ even} \n                              \\end{cases}</math>\n\nG<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>k</sub> are the capacitor or inductor element values.\nf<sub>H</sub>, the 3&nbsp;dB frequency is calculated with: <math>f_H = f_0 \\cosh \\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\cosh^{-1}\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)</math>\n\nThe coefficients ''A'', ''\u03b3'', ''\u03b2'', ''A''<sub>''k''</sub>, and ''B''<sub>''k''</sub> may be calculated from the following equations:\n\n:<math>\\gamma = \\sinh \\left ( \\frac{ \\beta }{ 2n } \\right )</math>\n\n:<math>\\beta = \\ln\\left [ \\coth \\left ( \\frac{ R_{db} }{ 17.37 } \\right ) \\right ]</math>\n\n:<math>A_k=\\sin\\frac{ (2k-1)\\pi }{ 2n },\\qquad k = 1,2,3,\\dots, n   </math>\n\n:<math>B_k=\\gamma^{2}+\\sin^{2}\\left ( \\frac{ k \\pi }{ n } \\right ),\\qquad k = 1,2,3,\\dots,n </math>\nwhere ''R''<sub>dB</sub> is the passband ripple in decibels.\n\n[[File:Cauer Topology Lowpass Filter.svg|thumb|right|450px|Low-pass filter using Cauer topology]]\n\nThe calculated ''G''<sub>''k''</sub> values may then be converted into [[shunt (electrical)|shunt]] capacitors and [[series (circuit)|series]] inductors as shown on the right, or they may be converted into series capacitors and shunt inductors. For example,\n\n*''C''<sub>1 shunt</sub> = G<sub>1</sub>, ''L''<sub>2 series</sub> = ''G''<sub>2</sub>, ...\nor \n*''L''<sub>1 shunt</sub> = ''G''<sub>1</sub>, ''C''<sub>1 series</sub> = ''G''<sub>2</sub>, ...\n\nNote that when G<sub>1</sub> is a shunt capacitor or series inductor, G<sub>0</sub> corresponds to the input resistance or conductance, respectively. The same relationship holds for G<sub>n+1</sub> and G<sub>n</sub>. The resulting circuit is a normalized low-pass filter. Using [[frequency transformations]] and [[impedance scaling]], the normalized low-pass filter may be transformed into [[high-pass filter|high-pass]], [[band-pass filter|band-pass]], and [[band-stop filter|band-stop]] filters of any desired [[cutoff frequency]] or [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]].\n\n=== Digital ===\nAs with most analog filters, the Chebyshev may be converted to a digital (discrete-time) [[recursive filter|recursive]] form via the [[bilinear transform]].  However, as [[digital filter]]s have a finite bandwidth, the response shape of the transformed Chebyshev is [[bilinear transform#Frequency warping|warped]].   Alternatively, the [[Matched Z-transform method]] may be used, which does not warp the response.\n\n==Comparison with other linear filters==\nThe following illustration shows the Chebyshev filters next to other common filter types obtained with the same number of coefficients (fifth order):\n\n[[Image:Electronic linear filters.svg|500px|center]]\n\nChebyshev filters are sharper than the [[Butterworth filter]]; they are not as sharp as the [[Elliptic filter|elliptic one]], but they show fewer ripples over the bandwidth.\n\n==See also==\n:''[[Filter design]]''\n* [[Bessel filter]]\n* [[Comb filter]]\n* [[Elliptic filter]]\n* [[Chebyshev nodes]]\n* [[Chebyshev polynomial]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book | last=Daniels | first=Richard W. |authorlink= | coauthors= | title=Approximation Methods for Electronic Filter Design |year=1974 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=0-07-015308-6 }}\n* {{Cite book | last1 = Williams | first1= Arthur B. |last2=Taylors | first2=Fred J. | title =Electronic Filter Design Handbook | location= New York | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-07-070434-1 | postscript = <!--None-->}}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Matthaei | first1 = George L. | last2 = Young | first2 = Leo | last3 = Jones | first3 = E.
