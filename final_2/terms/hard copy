Examples of hard copy include [[teleprinter]] pages, continuous printed tapes, computer printouts, and radio photo prints.<ref name=FS>[http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-017/_2534.htm Hard copy] as defined in [[Federal Standard 1037C]].\n</ref>\n\nHard Copy Records, such as printed forms, tab cards, and OCR forms, are best designed using a record layout.<!--{{Citation needed}} begin-->{{fix |link=Wikipedia:Citation needed#Citation needed |text=citation needed |class=Template-Fact }}<!--{{Citation needed}} end-->\n\n[[Magnetic tape]]s, [[diskette]]s, and non-printed [[punched paper tape]]s are not hard copies.<ref name=FS/>\n\nThe term \"hard copy\" predates the age of the digital computer.  In the process of producing printed books and newspapers, '''hard copy''' refers to a manuscript or typewritten document that has been edited and proofread, and is ready for [[typesetting]], or being read on-air in a radio or television broadcast.  This traditional meaning has been all but forgotten in the wake of the [[information revolution]].<ref name=MW>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/copy hard copy] as defined by Merriam-Webster Online.</ref>\n\n== \"Dead-tree edition\" ==\n''Dead-tree edition'' refers to a printed [[paper]] version of a written work, as opposed to digital alternatives such as a [[web page]]. It is a [[dysphemism]] for ''hard copy''. Variations include ''dead-tree format'' and ''dead-tree-ware''. \"Dead-tree\" refers to [[tree]]s being cut down for raw material for producing paper. Newspapers are, sometimes pejoratively, referred to as ''the dead-tree-press''.

This means that an advantage of keeping documents in digital form rather than on paper is that they can be more easily searched for specific contents. An exception are texts stored as [[digital image]]s (digital [[facsimile]]), as they cannot be easily searched, except by sophisticated means such as [[optical character recognition]] or examining the image [[metadata]]. On the other hand, paper copies have tremendous [[data integrity]] in proper conditions.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Copy editing]]\n* [[Copywriting]]\n* [[Hardcover]]\n* [[Soft copy]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|hard copy|printout}}\n\n{{FS1037C MS188}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hard Copy}}\n[[Category:Information technology]]\n\n[[de:Hardcopy]]"}]}}}}
