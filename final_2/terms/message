A message may be delivered by various means, including [[courier]], [[telegraphy]], [[carrier pigeon]] and [[Bus (computing)|electronic bus]].\nA message can be the content of a [[broadcasting|broadcast]].  An interactive\nexchange of messages forms a [[conversation]].\n\nOne example of a message is a '''communiqu\u00e9''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|\u0259|\u02c8|m|ju\u02d0|n|\u026a-|k|e\u026a|}}), which is a brief report or statement released by a public agency.\n\n== Role in human communication == \n\nIn communication between humans, messages can be [[Words|verbal]] or nonverbal:\n\n* A verbal message is an exchange of information using words. Examples include face-to-face communication, telephone calls, voicemails, etc.\n* A nonverbal message is communicated through actions or behaviors rather than words, e.g. by the use of [[body language]].\n\n== In computer science ==\n\nThere are two main senses of the word \"message\" in [[computing]]:  messages between the human users of [[computer]] systems that are delivered by those computer systems, and [[Event (computing)|messages]] passed between programs or between components of a [[Single transferable vote|single]] program, for their own purposes.\n\n* [[Instant messaging]] and [[e-mail]] are examples of computer software designed for delivering human-readable messages in formatted or unformatted text, from one person to another.\n* [[Message passing]] is a form of communication used in concurrent and parallel computing, object-oriented programming, and interprocess communication, where communication is made by sending messages to recipients. In a related use of this sense of a message, in [[object-oriented programming language]]s such as [[Smalltalk]] or [[Java (programming language)|Java]], a ''message'' is sent to an [[Object (computer science)|object]], specifying a ''request'' for action.\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Airmail]]\n* [[Amateur radio emergency communications]]\n* [[Beacon]]\n* [[Communications satellite]]\n* [[Communication studies]]\n* [[Drum (communication)]]\n* [[Email]]\n* [[Emergency Alert System]]\n* [[Encryption]]\n* [[Express mail]]\n* [[Instant messaging]]\n* [[Interstellar messages]]\n* [[Mail]]\n* [[Message in a bottle]]\n* [[Packet (information technology)]]\n* [[Pioneer plaque]]\n* [[Pony Express]]\n* [[Radio]]\n* [[Semaphore line|Semaphore]]\n* [[Semiotics]]\n* [[Sign language]]\n* [[Smoke signals]]\n* [[Steamships|Steamshipping]]\n* [[Telegraphy]]\n* [[Telephony]]\n* [[Television]]\n* [[Short message service|Text messaging]]\n* [[Shipping|Wind-powered shipping]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{commonscat-inline|Messages}}\n\n[[Category:Communication]]"}]}}}}
