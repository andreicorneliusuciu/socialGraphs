This device is a variation of Mueller's original crocodile clip design, which was invented by Ralph Mueller in the early 1900s.]]\n[[image:Alligator clip 442.jpg|thumb|Standard clip]]\n[[File:Booster cables.jpg|thumb|Crocodile clips, also called automotive clips, on a set of [[Jump_start_(vehicle)#Jumper_cables|jumper cables]]]]\n[[Image:Three alligator clips.JPG|thumb|right|Three crocodile clips: a bare standard-sized clip; a miniature clip in a yellow plastic boot; a large red [[Square D]] multi-function clip.]]\n[[image:Alligator clips 444.jpg|thumb|Pair of standard clips]]\n\nA '''crocodile clip'''{{cn|date=April 2016}} (also '''alligator clip'''{{cn|date=April 2016}} or '''spring clip'''{{cn|date=April 2016}}) is a sprung metal clip with long, serrated jaws which is used for creating a temporary [[electrical connection]]. This simple mechanical device gets its name from the resemblance of its jaws to that of an [[alligator]]'s or [[crocodile]]'s. It is used to connect an electrical cable to a battery or some other component. Functioning much like a spring-loaded [[clothespin]], the clip's tapered, serrated jaws are forced together by a [[spring (device)|spring]] to grip an object. When manufactured for electronics testing and evaluation, one jaw of the clip is typically permanently crimped or soldered to a wire, or is bent to form the inner tubular contact of a ~4&nbsp;mm female [[banana connector|banana jack]], enabling quick non-permanent connection between a circuit under test and laboratory equipment or to another [[electrical circuit]]. The clip is typically covered by a plastic shroud or \"boot\" to prevent accidental short-circuits.\n\nSmall versions, ranging in size from 15\u201340&nbsp;mm in length, are used in electrical [[laboratory]] work. \n\nLarge versions of these clips, called '''automotive clips''' or '''battery clamps''', are made of solid [[copper]] for low [[electrical resistance]], and are used with thick insulated copper cables to make connections between automobile batteries. These '''[[Jump_start_(vehicle)#Jumper_cables|jumper cables]]''' are capable of delivering hundreds of Amperes of current needed to directly power an automobile starter motor, or to transfer energy from a charged [[lead-acid battery]] to a discharged one.\n\n== Specifications ==\n\nThe United States Defense Logistics Agency specifies several types of electrical clips in Commercial Item Description (CID) A-A-59466. In this CID document, crocodile clips are designated type CC, alligator clips are designated types TCx, and other types of electrical clips have various other, unique designations.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title=CLIPS, ELECTRICAL, GENERAL SPECIFICATION FOR\n|url=http://www.landandmaritime.dla.mil/Downloads/MilSpec/Docs/A-A-59466/aa59466.pdf/\n|accessdate=2015-08-02\n|author=United States General Services Administration\n|date=2011-09-22}}</ref>\n\n== Other uses ==\n* Dentistry: crocodile clips are often used on the ends of a cord in [[dentistry|dental]] offices to attach a protective bib over the patient's clothing.\n* Laboratory: crocodile  clips are frequently used to quickly and cheaply assemble or modify experimental circuits. They are useful for connecting components to wires.\n* Education: like their laboratory use, crocodile clips are sometimes used with batteries, small lightbulbs and other small electrical devices in schools to teach students about electricity.\n* Fencing: crocodile  clips are used in [[fencing]] to connect to participants' [[lam\u00e9 (fencing)|lam\u00e9]] vests to touch-detection systems.\n* Hobby: crocodile clips can be used as miniature clamps to hold parts together for [[adhesive|gluing]] or [[soldering]].\n** '''[[Helping hand (tool)|Helping Hands]]''' typically have two crocodile clips.\n* Camping: crocodile clips may be designed to attach a rope to a tarp or other sheet of material. (While this serves the same purpose as a grommet, it may lead to premature wear at the point of attachment.)\n* Drug use: as a '''[[roach clip]]''' for holding burning [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to avoid burning fingers.\n* Film/animation: useful for airborne scenes in possible stop-motion or holding models of any sort in mid air.\n* Electronics: useful as a [[heat sink]] while soldering heat-sensitive devices.\n\n== Kelvin clip ==\nA Kelvin clip is a special form of crocodile clip. The jaws of a Kelvin clip are insulated from each other, allowing 2 isolated wires to connect to a single test point. This enables [[four-terminal sensing|4-wire measurement]] of circuits with very low resistances.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{commons category|Alligator clips}}\n\n[[Category:Electrical connectors]]\n\n[[ja:\u30ef\u30cb\u30b0\u30c1\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7]]"}]}}}}
