Chemical kinetics includes investigations of how different experimental conditions can influence the speed of a chemical reaction and yield information about the [[reaction mechanism|reaction's mechanism]] and [[transition state]]s, as well as the construction of mathematical models that can describe the characteristics of a chemical reaction.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1864, [[Peter Waage]] and [[Cato Guldberg]] pioneered the development of chemical kinetics by formulating the [[law of mass action]], which states that the speed of a chemical reaction is proportional to the quantity of the reacting substances.<ref name=\"GW1\">C.M.

Relatively simple [[rate law]]s exist for [[Rate law#Zero-order reactions|zero order reactions]] (for which reaction rates are independent of concentration), [[Rate equation#First-order reactions|first order reaction]]s, and [[second-order reaction|second order reaction]]s, and can be derived for others. [[Elementary reaction]]s follow the [[law of mass action]], but the rate law of [[stepwise reaction]]s has to be derived by combining the rate laws of the various elementary steps, and can become rather complex. In consecutive reactions, the [[rate-determining step]] often determines the kinetics. In consecutive first order reactions, a [[steady state (chemistry)|steady state]] approximation can simplify the [[rate law]]. The [[activation energy]] for a reaction is experimentally determined through the [[Arrhenius equation]] and the [[Eyring equation]]. The main factors that influence the [[reaction rate]] include: the [[physical state]] of the reactants, the [[concentrations]] of the reactants, the [[temperature]] at which the reaction occurs, and whether or not any [[catalysts]] are present in the reaction.\n\n[[Alexander Nikolaevich Gorban|Gorban]] and Yablonsky have suggested that the history of chemical dynamics can be divided into three eras.<ref>A.N. Gorban, G.S. Yablonsky [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281411623_Three_Waves_of_Chemical_Dynamics Three Waves of Chemical Dynamics], ''Mathematical Modelling of Natural Phenomena'' 10(5) (2015), p. 1\u20135.</ref> The first is the van 't Hoff wave searching for the general laws of chemical reactions and relating kinetics to thermodynamics. The second may be called the [[Nikolay Semyonov|Semenov]]--[[Cyril Norman Hinshelwood|Hinshelwood]] wave with emphasis on reaction mechanisms, especially for [[Chain reaction#chemical chain reactions|chain reactions]]. The third is associated with [[Rutherford Aris|Aris]] and the detailed mathematical description of chemical reaction networks. \n\n== Factors affecting reaction rate ==\n\n===Nature of the reactants===\nDepending upon what substances are reacting, the reaction rate varies. Acid/base reactions, the formation of [[salts]], and [[ion exchange]] are fast reactions. When covalent bond formation takes place between the molecules and when large molecules are formed, the reactions tend to be very slow.\nNature and strength of bonds in reactant molecules greatly influence the rate of its transformation into products.\n\n===Physical state===\nThe [[physical state]] ([[solid]], [[liquid]], or [[gas]]) of a reactant is also an important factor of the rate of change. When reactants are in the same [[phase (matter)|phase]], as in [[aqueous]] [[solution]], thermal motion brings them into contact. However, when they are in different phases, the reaction is limited to the interface between the reactants. Reaction can occur only at their area of contact; in the case of a liquid and a gas, at the surface of the liquid. Vigorous shaking and stirring may be needed to bring the reaction to completion. This means that the more finely divided a solid or liquid reactant the greater its [[surface area]] per unit [[volume]] and the more contact it with the other reactant, thus the faster the reaction. To make an analogy, for example, when one starts a fire, one uses wood chips and small branches \u2014 one does not start with large logs right away. In organic chemistry, [[on water reaction]]s are the exception to the rule that homogeneous reactions take place faster than heterogeneous reactions.\n\n===Surface area of solids===\nIn a solid, only those particles that are at the surface can be involved in a reaction. Crushing a solid into smaller parts means that more particles are present at the surface, and the frequency of collisions between these and reactant particles increases, and so reaction occurs more rapidly. For example, [[Sherbet (powder)]] is a mixture of very fine powder of [[malic acid]] (a weak organic acid) and [[sodium hydrogen carbonate]]. On contact with the [[saliva]] in the mouth, these chemicals quickly dissolve and react, releasing [[carbon dioxide]] and providing for the fizzy sensation. Also, [[fireworks]] manufacturers modify the surface area of solid reactants to control the rate at which the fuels in fireworks are oxidised, using this to create different effects. For example, finely divided [[aluminium]] confined in a shell explodes violently. If larger pieces of aluminium are used, the reaction is slower and sparks are seen as pieces of burning metal are ejected.\n\n===Concentration===\n{{main article|Rate equation}}\nThe reactions are due to collisions of reactant species. The frequency with which the molecules or ions collide depends upon their [[concentration]]s. The more crowded the molecules are, the more likely they are to collide and react with one another. Thus, an increase in the concentrations of the reactants will usually result in the corresponding increase in the reaction rate, while a decrease in the concentrations will usually have a reverse effect. For example, [[combustion]] will occur more rapidly in pure oxygen than in air (21% oxygen).\n\nThe [[rate equation]] shows the detailed dependence of the reaction rate on the concentrations of reactants and other species present. Different mathematical forms are possible depending on the [[reaction mechanism]]. The actual rate equation for a given reaction is determined experimentally and provides information about the reaction mechanism.\n\n===Temperature===\n{{main article|Arrhenius equation}}\n[[Temperature]] usually has a major effect on the rate of a chemical reaction. Molecules at a higher temperature have more [[thermal energy]]. Although collision frequency is greater at higher temperatures, this alone contributes only a very small proportion to the increase in rate of reaction. Much more important is the fact that the proportion of reactant molecules with sufficient energy to react (energy greater than [[activation energy]]: ''E''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''E''<sub>''a''</sub>) is significantly higher and is explained in detail by the [[Maxwell&ndash;Boltzmann distribution]] of molecular energies.\n\nThe 'rule of thumb' that the rate of chemical reactions doubles for every 10&nbsp;\u00b0C temperature rise is a common misconception. This may have been generalized from the special case of biological systems, where the [[Q10 (temperature coefficient)|''\u03b1'' (temperature coefficient)]] is often between 1.5 and 2.5.\n\nA reaction's kinetics can also be studied with a [[temperature jump]] approach. This involves using a sharp rise in temperature and observing the [[relaxation time]] of the return to equilibrium. A particularly useful form of [[temperature jump]] apparatus is a [[shock tube]], which can rapidly jump a gas's temperature by more than 1000 degrees.\n\n===Catalysts===\n{{main article|Catalysis}}\n[[Image:Activation energy.svg|thumb|right|Generic potential energy diagram showing the effect of a catalyst in a hypothetical endothermic chemical reaction. The presence of the catalyst opens a different reaction pathway (shown in red) with a lower activation energy. The final result and the overall thermodynamics are the same.]]\nA [[catalyst]] is a substance that alters the rate of a chemical reaction but remains [[chemically]] unchanged afterwards. The catalyst increases the rate of the reaction by providing a different [[reaction mechanism]] to occur with a lower [[activation energy]]. In [[autocatalysis]] a reaction product is itself a catalyst for that reaction leading to [[positive feedback]]. Proteins that act as catalysts in biochemical reactions are called [[enzyme]]s. [[Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics]] describe the [[enzyme kinetics|rate of enzyme mediated reactions]]. A catalyst does not affect the position of the equilibrium, as the catalyst speeds up the backward and forward reactions equally.\n\nIn certain organic molecules, specific substituents can have an influence on reaction rate in [[neighbouring group participation]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Pressure===\nIncreasing the pressure in a gaseous reaction will increase the number of collisions between reactants, increasing the rate of reaction. This is because the [[activity (chemistry)|activity]] of a gas is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas. This is similar to the effect of increasing the concentration of a solution.\n\nIn addition to this straightforward mass-action effect, the rate coefficients themselves can change due to pressure. The rate coefficients and products of many high-temperature gas-phase reactions change if an inert gas is added to the mixture; variations on this effect are called [[fall-off]] and [[chemical activation]]. These phenomena are due to exothermic or endothermic reactions occurring faster than heat transfer, causing the reacting molecules to have non-thermal energy distributions (non-[[Boltzmann distribution]]). Increasing the pressure increases the heat transfer rate between the reacting molecules and the rest of the system, reducing this effect.\n\nCondensed-phase rate coefficients can also be affected by (very high) pressure; this is a completely different effect than fall-off or chemical-activation. It is often studied using [[diamond anvil]]s.\n\nA reaction's kinetics can also be studied with a [[pressure jump]] approach. This involves making fast changes in pressure and observing the [[relaxation time]] of the return to equilibrium.\n\n==Experimental methods==\n\nThe experimental determination of reaction rates involves measuring how the concentrations of reactants or products change over time. For example, the concentration of a reactant can be measured by [[spectrophotometry]] at a wavelength where no other reactant or product in the system absorbs light.\n\nFor reactions which take at least several minutes, it is possible to start the observations after the reactants have been mixed at the temperature of interest.\n\n=== Fast reactions ===\nFor faster reactions, the time required to mix the reactants and bring them to a specified temperature may be comparable or longer than the [[half-life]] of the reaction.<ref name=Laidler>[[Keith J.

''Chemical Kinetics and Dynamics'' (2nd ed., Prentice-Hall 1999) p.94-97 ISBN 0-13-737123-3</ref>\n\n== Equilibrium ==\nWhile chemical kinetics is concerned with the rate of a chemical reaction, [[thermodynamics]] determines the extent to which reactions occur. In a [[reversible reaction]], chemical equilibrium is reached when the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal (the principle of [[detailed balance]]) and the concentrations of the [[reactant]]s and [[Product (chemistry)|products]] no longer change. This is demonstrated by, for example, the [[Haber&ndash;Bosch process]] for combining nitrogen and hydrogen to produce ammonia. [[Chemical clock]] reactions such as the [[Belousov&ndash;Zhabotinsky reaction]] demonstrate that component concentrations can oscillate for a long time before finally attaining the equilibrium.\n\n== Free energy ==\nIn general terms, the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy change (\u0394G)]] of a reaction determines whether a chemical change will take place, but kinetics describes how fast the reaction is. A reaction can be very [[exothermic]] and have a very positive [[entropy]] change but will not happen in practice if the reaction is too slow. If a reactant can produce two different products, the thermodynamically most stable one will in general form, except in special circumstances when the reaction is said to be under [[kinetic reaction control]]. The [[Curtin&ndash;Hammett principle]] applies when determining the product ratio for two reactants interconverting rapidly, each going to a different product. It is possible to make predictions about reaction rate constants for a reaction from [[free-energy relationship]]s.\n\nThe [[kinetic isotope effect]] is the difference in the rate of a chemical reaction when an atom in one of the reactants is replaced by one of its [[isotope]]s.\n\nChemical kinetics provides information on [[Residence time distribution|residence time]] and [[heat transfer]] in a [[chemical reactor]] in [[chemical engineering]] and the [[molar mass distribution]] in [[polymer chemistry]].\n\n==Applications and models==\nThe mathematical models that describe chemical reaction kinetics provide chemists and chemical engineers with tools to better understand and describe chemical processes such as food decomposition, microorganism growth, stratospheric ozone decomposition, and the complex chemistry of biological systems. These models can also be used in the design or modification of chemical reactors to optimize product yield, more efficiently separate products, and eliminate environmentally harmful by-products. When performing [[catalytic cracking]] of heavy hydrocarbons into gasoline and light gas, for example, kinetic models can be used to find the temperature and pressure at which the highest yield of heavy hydrocarbons into gasoline will occur.\n\nChemical Kinetics is frequently validated and explored through modeling in specialized packages as a function of [[ordinary differential equation]]-solving (ODE-solving) and [[curve-fitting]].<ref name=\"ChemicalKinetics\">{{cite web|url=http://www.civilized.com/files/sobnew.pdf|title=Chemical Kinetics: Simple Binding: F + G \u21cb B|publisher=Civilized Software, Inc.| accessdate = 2015-09-01}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Autocatalytic reactions and order creation]]\n*[[Detonation]]\n*[[Electrochemical kinetics]]\n*[[Flame speed]]\n*[[Heterogenous catalysis]]\n*[[Intrinsic low-dimensional manifold]]\n*[[MLAB]] chemical kinetics modeling package\n*[[Nonthermal surface reaction]]\n*[[PottersWheel]] Matlab toolbox to fit chemical rate constants to experimental data\n*[[Reaction progress kinetic analysis]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n{{Library resources box \n|by=no \n|onlinebooks=no \n|others=no \n|about=yes \n|label=Chemical kinetics}}\n* [http://www.chm.davidson.edu/ChemistryApplets/kinetics/ Chemistry applets]\n* [http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~cchieh/cact/c123/chmkntcs.html University of Waterloo]\n* [http://www.Chemked.com/ Chemical Kinetics of Gas Phase Reactions]\n* [https://code.google.com/p/kinpy/ Kinpy: Python code generator for solving kinetic equations]\n\n{{Reaction mechanisms}}\n{{BranchesofChemistry}}\n{{Chemical eng}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Chemical kinetics| ]]"}]}}}}
