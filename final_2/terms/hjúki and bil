Both Hj\u00faki and Bil are solely attested in the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]. Scholarly theories that surround the two concern their nature, their role as potential personifications of the [[lunar craters|craters on the moon]] or [[lunar phase|its phases]], and their relation to later folklore in [[Germanic languages|Germanic Europe]]. Bil has been identified with the '''[[Feldgeister#Bilwis|Bilwis]]''', an agriculture-associated figure that is frequently attested in the folklore of German-speaking areas of Europe.\n\n==Attestations==\nIn chapter 11 of the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', the enthroned figure of High states that two children by the names of Hj\u00faki and Bil were fathered by [[Vi\u00f0finnr]]. Once while the two were walking from the well Byrgir (Old Norse \"Hider of Something\"<ref name=BYOCK156>Byock (2005:156).</ref>) \u2014 both of them carrying on their shoulders the pole Simul (Old Norse, possibly meaning \"eternal\"<ref name=ORCHARD147>Orchard (1997:147).</ref>) that held the [[bucket|pail]] S\u00e6g between them \u2014 M\u00e1ni took them from the earth, and they now follow M\u00e1ni in the heavens, \"as can be seen from the earth\".<ref name=BYOCK20>Byock (2005:20).</ref>\n\nHj\u00faki is otherwise unmentioned, but Bil receives recognition. In chapter 35 of ''Gylfaginning'', at the end of a listing of numerous other goddesses in Norse mythology, both [[S\u00f3l (Sun)|S\u00f3l]] (the personified sun) and Bil are listed together as [[\u00c6sir|goddesses]] \"whose nature has already been described\".<ref name=BYOCK44>Byock (2005:44).</ref> Bil appears twice more in the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]''. In chapter 75, Bil appears within another list of goddesses,<ref name=FAULKES157>Faulkes (1995:157).</ref> and her name appears in chapter 47 in a [[kenning]] for \"woman\".<ref name=FAULKES47>Faulkes (1995:47).</ref>\n\n==Theories==\n[[File:Man-in-the-Moon-from-L-Richter.jpg|thumb|A 19th century drawing of ''The Man in the Moon'' from folklore in areas of Germanic Europe]]\n\n===Identification and representation===\nAs the two are otherwise unattested outside of Snorri's ''Prose Edda'', suggestions have been made that Hj\u00faki and Bil may have been of minor mythic significance, or that they were made up outright by Snorri, while [[Anne Holtsmark]] (1945) posits that Snorri may have known or had access to a now lost verse source wherein Hj\u00faki and Bil personified the waxing and waning moon. Holtsmark further theorizes that Bil may have been a [[d\u00eds]] (a type of female deity).<ref name=LINDOW78>Lindow (2001:78) referencing Holtsmark (1945:139\u2013154).</ref>\n\nScholars have theorized that Hj\u00faki and Bil may represent lunar activity, including that they may represent the [[Lunar phase|phases of the moon]] or may represent the [[lunar craters|craters of the moon]]. 19th century scholar [[Jacob Grimm]] rejects the suggestion that Hj\u00faki and Bil represent the phases of the moon, and states that Hj\u00faki and Bil rather represent the craters on the moon seen from the earth. Grimm says that the evidence for this \"is plain from the figure itself. No ''change'' of the moon could suggest the image of ''two children'' with a ''pail slung over their shoulders''. Moreover, to this day the Swedish people see in the ''spots'' of the moon two persons carrying a big ''bucket on a pole''.\"<ref name=GRIMM717>Grimm (1883:717).</ref> Grimm adds that:\n<blockquote>\n:What is most important for us, out of the heathen fancy of a ''kidnapping man of the moon'', which, apart from Scandinavia, was doubtless in vogue all over [[Germanic-speaking Europe|Teutondom]], if not farther, there has evolved itself since a Christian adaptation. They say the man in the moon is a ''wood-stealer'', who during church time on the holy sabbath committed a trespass in the wood, and was then transported to the moon as a punishment; there he may be seen with the ''axe on his back'' and the ''bundle of brushwood'' (dornwelle) ''in his hand''. Plainly enough the water-pole of the heathen story has been transformed into the axe's shaft, and the carried pail into the thornbrush; the general idea of theft was retained, but special stress laid on the keeping of the christian holiday; the man suffers punishment not so much for cutting firewood, as because he did it on Sunday.<ref name=GRIMM717/>\n</blockquote>\nGrimm gives further examples from Germanic folklore until the time of his writing (the 19th century) and notes a potential connection between the German word ''wadel'' (meaning the full moon) and the dialectal employment of the word for \"brushwood, twigs tied up in a bundle, esp[ecially] fir-twigs, ''wadeln'' to tie up brushwood\", and the practice of cutting wood out in the full moon.<ref name=GRIMM717/> [[Benjamin Thorpe]] agrees with the theory of Hj\u00faki and Bil as the personified shapes of moon craters.<ref name=THORPE143>Thorpe (1851:143).</ref>\n\n[[Rudolf Simek]] states that the obscurity of the names of the objects in the tale of Hj\u00faki and Bil may indicate that Snorri derived them from a folktale, and that the form of the tale of the [[Man in the Moon]] (featuring a man with a pole and a woman with a bushel) is also found in modern folklore in Scandinavia, England, and Northern Germany.<ref name=SIMEK201>Simek (2007:201).</ref>\n[[File:Jack and Jill 1 - WW Denslow - Project Gutenberg etext 18546.jpg|thumb|[[Jack and Jill (nursery rhyme)|Jack and Jill]], proposed as connected to Hj\u00faki and Bil]]\nIn both the story Hj\u00faki and Bil found in the Icelandic ''Prose Edda'' and the English nursery rhyme \"[[Jack and Jill (nursery rhyme)|Jack and Jill]]\", two children, one male and one female, fetch a pail of water, and the pairs have names that have been perceived as phonetically similar. These elements have resulted in theories connecting the two,<ref name=STREATFIELD68>Streatfield (1884:68).</ref> and the notion has had some influence, appearing in school books for children from the 19th century and into the 20th century.<ref name=JUDD>Judd (1896:39\u201340) features such a retelling entitled \"JACK AND JILL. A SCANDINAVIAN MYTH\". The theory is repeated in the late 20th century by Jones (1998:6).</ref> A traditional form of the rhyme reads:\n<blockquote>\n:Jack and Jill went up the hill\n:to fetch a pail of water\n:Jack fell down and broke his crown\n:and Jill came tumbling after.\n:Up Jack got and home did trot\n:as fast as he could caper.\n:He went to bed to mind his head\n:with vinegar and brown paper.<ref name=JONES6>Jones (1998:6).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Bilwis===\nA figure by the name of ''[[Bilwis]]'' is attested in various parts of German-speaking Europe starting in the 13th century. Scholar [[Leander Petzoldt]] writes that the figure seems to stem from the goddess and over time saw many changes, later developing \"an [[elf]]in, [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]]ish aspect and the ability to cripple people or cattle with the shot of an arrow\" (such as in [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s 13th century poem \"[[Willehalm]]\"). Petzoldt further surveys the development of the figure:\n<blockquote>\nDuring the course of the thirteenth century, the Bilwis is less and less frequently treated as the personification of a supernatural power but becomes increasingly identified as a malevolent human being, a [[witch]]. Still later, with the rise of the [[Witch-hunt|witch persecution]] at the end of the [[Middle Ages]], the Bilwis was demonized; she becomes an incarnation of the devil for the witch and sorcerer. A final development has taken place since the sixteenth century, especially in northeast Germany, the Bilwis has been conceived of as a grain spirit bringing wealth; yet this latest manifestation of the Bilwis has its harmful side, the Bilwis-cutter, who is blamed for the unexplained patterns that are formed among the rows of standing grain. The cutter is a sorcerer or witch that cuts down the corn with sickles that are fastened to its feet. He is classified as an essentially malevolent Corn Spirit. Thus, the Bilwis is exceedingly polymorphous, taking on many appearances and meaning in all German-speaking areas throughout the Middle Ages. The Bilwis is one of the strangest and most mysterious beings in all folklore; its varying forms reflect the concerns of a farm culture, and it serves to explain the eerie appearance of turned-down rows of plants in cornfields.<ref name=\"PETZOLDT-393-394\">Petzoldt (2002:393\u2014394).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Toponyms===\nThe village of [[Bilsby]] in [[Lincolnshire]], [[England]] (from which the English surname ''Billing'' derives) has been proposed as having been named after Bil.<ref name=STREATFIELD68/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Sinthgunt]], a Germanic goddess possibly connected to the Moon\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Byock, Jesse (Trans.)
