It was thus arguably the world's first front-wheel-drive [[automobile]], but it never saw mass production, with only one copy ever made.

The [[BSA cars|BSA]] (Birmingham Small Arms Company) produced the unique front-wheel-drive BSA three-wheeler. Production continued until 1936 during which time sports and touring models were available. In 1931 the [[DKW]] F1 from [[Germany]] made its debut. [[Buckminster Fuller]] adopted rear-engine, front wheel drive for his three [[Dymaxion Car]] prototypes. Other German car producers followed: [[Stoewer]] offered a car with front-wheel drive in 1931, [[Adler (automobile)|Adler]] in 1932 and [[Audi]] in 1933. In 1934, the very successful [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant|Traction Avant]] cars were introduced by [[Citro\u00ebn]] of [[France]]. The [[Cord Automobile#Cord Model 810|Cord 810]] of the United States managed a bit better in the late 1930s than its predecessor one decade earlier. These vehicles featured a layout that places the engine behind the transmission, running \"backwards,\" (save for the Cord, which drove the transmission from the front of the engine). The basic front-wheel-drive layout provides sharp turning, and better weight distribution creates \"positive handling characteristics\" due to its low [[polar inertia]] and relatively favourable weight distribution.<ref name=nytimes>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50C12FC3D5E167B93C0A8178FD85F428385F9&scp=1&sq=Cord+front-drive+car+is+here&st=p \"Cord front-drive car is here\"], ''The New York Times''.

[[Panhard]] of France, [[DKW]] of Germany and [[Saab (automobile)|Saab]] of Sweden offered exclusively front-wheel-drive cars, starting with the 1948 [[Saab 92]].\n\nIn 1946, [[Lloyd cars|Lloyd Cars]], the English car company, had produced the front-wheel-drive roadster, [[Lloyd cars#Lloyd 650|Lloyd 650]]. The two-stroke, two-cylinder motor was mounted transversely in the front and connected to the front wheels through four-speed synchronised gearbox. The high price and lacklustre performance had doomed its production. Only 600 units were produced from 1946 to 1950.\n\nIn 1954, Alfa-Romeo had experimented with its first front-wheel-drive compact car named \"33\" (not related or referred to sports car similarly named \"33\"). It had the same transverse-mounted, forward-motor layout as the modern front-wheel-drive automobiles. It even resembled the smaller version of its popular [[Alfa Romeo Giulia]]. However, due to the financial difficulties in post-war Italy, the 33 never saw the production. Had Alfa-Romeo succeed in producing 33, it would precede the Mini as the first \"modern\" European front-wheel-drive compact car.\n\nIn 1955, one of the first Japanese manufacturers to utilize front-wheel drive with a transversely installed engine was the [[Suzuki Suzulight]], which was a small \"city\" car, called a ''[[kei car]]'' in Japanese.\n\nIn 1959 [[Austin Mini]] was launched by the [[British Motor Corporation]], designed by [[Alec Issigonis]] as a response to the first 'oil crisis', the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], and the boom in [[bubble cars]] that followed. It was the first production front-wheel-drive car with a [[watercooled]] inline four-cylinder engine mounted transversely. This allowed eighty percent of the floor plan for the use of passengers and luggage. The majority of modern cars use this configuration. Its progressive rate rubber sprung independent suspension, low centre of gravity, and wheel at each corner with radial tyres, gave a massive increase in grip and handling over all but the most expensive cars on the market. It used [[GKN]] designed [[Constant-velocity joint]] drive shaft [[universal joint]]s.\n\n===1960{{spaced ndash}}1975===\n[[File:Chassisroulant.JPG|thumb|1960's [[Renault 4]] [[rolling chassis]] with gearbox ahead of engine]]\n[[File:Automotive diagrams 08 En.png|thumb|Front-wheel-drive FF layout as used by [[Audi]] and [[Subaru]]]]\nThe transversely mounted engine combined with front-wheel drive was popularized by the 1959 [[Mini]];<!--{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}this information has been referenced on the mini page, citation superfluous--> there the transmission was built into the [[sump]] of the engine, and drive was transferred to it via a set of primary [[gear]]s. Another variant transmission concept was used by [[Simca]] in the 1960s keeping the engine and transmission in line, but transverse mounted and with unequal length driveshafts.  This has proven itself to be the model on which almost all modern FWD vehicles are now based. [[Peugeot]] and [[Renault]] on their jointly developed small car engine of the 1970s where the 4-cylinder block was canted over to reduce the overall height of the engine with the transmission underneath ([[PSA X engine]]). The tendency of this layout to generate unwanted transmission \"whine\" has seen it fall out of favour. Also, clutch changes required engine removal.\n\nThe 1965 [[Triumph 1300]] was designed around a longitudinal engine with the transmission underneath. [[Audi]] has also used a longitudinally mounted engine overhung over the front wheels since the 1970s. Audi is one of the few manufacturers which still uses this particular configuration. It allows the use of equal-length [[half shaft]]s and the easy addition of [[all-wheel drive]], but has the disadvantage that it makes it difficult to achieve 50/50 weight distribution (although they remedy this in four-wheel-drive models by mounting the gearbox at the rear of the [[transaxle]].) The [[Subaru 1000]] appeared in 1966 utilizing front-wheel drive mated to a [[flat-4]] engine, with the driveshafts of equal length extending from the transmission, which addressed some of the issues of the powertrain being somewhat complex and unbalanced in the engine compartment - the [[Alfa Romeo Alfasud]] (and its replacement, the 1983 [[Alfa 33]]) also used the same layout.\n\n[[Honda]] also introduced several small front wheel drive vehiches, with the [[Honda N360|N360 and N600]], the [[Honda Z360|Z360 and Z600]] in 1967, the [[Honda 1300]] in 1969, followed by the [[Honda Civic]] in 1972 and the [[Honda Accord]] in 1976.\n\nAlso in the 1970s and 1980s, the [[Douvrin engine]]s used in the larger [[Renault]]s (20, 21, 25 and 30) used this longitudinal \"forward\" layout. The first generation [[Saab 900]], launched in 1978, also used a longitudinal engine with a transmission underneath with helical gears. The 1966 [[Oldsmobile Toronado]] was the first U.S. front-wheel-drive car since the [[Cord Automobile#Cord Model 810|Cord 810]]. It used a longitudinal engine placement for its V8, coupled with an unusual \"split\" transmission, which turned the engine power 180 degrees. Power then went to a differential mounted to the transmission case, from which half-shafts took it to the wheels. The driveline was set fairly at centre-point of the wheels for better weight distribution, though this raised the engine, requiring lowered intake systems.\n\n====Giacosa innovation====\n{{rquote|right|\n''Little known outside of Italy, the [[Autobianchi Primula|Primula]] is today primarily known for innovating the modern economy-car layout.''\n<br />''<small>\u2013 [[Hemmings Motor News]],<ref name=\"hemmings\">{{cite web\n| title = European Car of the Year 1965: BMC Scores a Win\n| publisher = Hemmings Motor News, August 2011\n| url = http://www.hemmings.com/hsx/stories/2011/08/01/hmn_feature17.html}}</ref> </small>''\n}}\n\n{{rquote|right|\n''This Active Tourer MPV wants to be more stable than a BMW M3, and using the '''Dante Giacosa-pattern''' front-wheel-drive layout compacts the mechanicals and saves space for people in the reduced overall length of what will surely become a production 1-series tall-sedan crossover.''\n<br />''<small>\u2013 [[Robert Cumberford]], <u>Automobile Magazine, March, 2013</u><ref name=\"autmobile01\">{{cite web\n| title = By Design: BMW Concept Active Tourer\n| publisher = [[Automobile Magazine]], Robert Cumberford, February 2013 Issue\n| url = http://www.automobilemag.com/features/by_design/1302_by_design_bmw_concept_active_tourer/}}</ref> </small>''\n}}\n\nFront-wheel drive layout had been highly impacted by the success of small, inexpensive cars, especially the British [[Mini]].

The layout often required the engine be removed to service the clutch.<ref name=\"dante1\">{{cite web\n  | title = Dante Giacosa\n  | publisher = Fiat500USA.com\n  | url = http://www.fiat500usa.com/2009/02/dante-giacosa.html}}</ref>\n\nAs engineered by [[Dante Giacosa]], the [[Fiat 128]] featured a transverse-mounted [[engine]] with unequal length drive shafts and an innovative clutch release mechanism \u2014 an arrangement which Fiat had strategically tested on a previous production model, the [[Autobianchi Primula|Primula]], from its less market-critical subsidiary, [[Autobianchi]].\n\nReady for production in 1964, the Primula featured a [[gear train]] offset from the [[differential (mechanics)|differential]] and final drive with unequal length [[drive shaft]]s.  The layout enabled the engine and gearbox to be located side by side without sharing lubricating fluid while orienting the cooling fan toward fresh air flow.  By using the Primula as a test-bed, Fiat was able to sufficiently resolve the layout's disadvantages, including uneven side-to-side power transmission, uneven tire wear and potential [[torque steer]], the tendency for the power of the engine alone to steer the car under heavy acceleration.\n\nAfter the 128, Fiat further demonstrated the layout's flexibility, re-configurating the 128 drive-train as a mid-engined layout for the [[Fiat X1/9]].

The change began in 1978, with the introduction of the first American-built transverse-engined cars, the [[Plymouth Horizon]] and [[Dodge Omni]] (based on the European designed [[Simca Horizon]]),<ref name=Nicalek>{{cite web|title=The Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon|author=Bryan T. Nicalek|publisher=Allpar|url=http://www.allpar.com/omni/omni.html}}</ref> followed by the 1980 [[Chevrolet Citation]] and numerous other vehicles.\nMeanwhile, European car makers, that had moved to front-wheel drive decades before, began to homogenize their engine arrangement only in this decade, leaving [[Audi]] (and [[Volkswagen]]) alone with the Audi front drive-longitudinal engine layout. Years before this was the most common layout in Europe, with examples like [[Citroen DS]], [[Renault 12]], [[Renault 5]], [[Renault 25]] (a Chrysler LH ancestor) [[Alfa Romeo 33]], [[Volkswagen Passat]], etc.\nThis transition can be exemplified in the [[Renault 21]] that was offered with disparate engine configurations. The 1.7-litre version featured an 'east-west' (transversely) mounted engine, but Renault had no gearbox suitable for a more powerful transverse engine: accordingly, faster versions featured longitudinally mounted (north south) engines.\n\nBy reducing drivetrain weight and space needs, vehicles could be made smaller and more efficient without sacrificing acceleration. Integrating the powertrain with a transverse as opposed to a longitudinal layout, along with unibody construction and the use of constant velocity jointed drive axles, along with front wheel drive has evolved into the modern-day mass market automobile. Some suggest that the introduction of the modern [[Volkswagen Golf]] in 1974, from a traditional U.S. competitor, and the introduction of the 1973 [[Honda Civic]], and the 1976 [[Honda Accord]] served as a wake-up call for the \"Big Three\" (only Chrysler already produced front-wheel-drive vehicles in their operations outside North America). Ford's 1976 [[Ford Fiesta]] was its first front-wheel-drive car in Europe, GM was even later with the 1979 [[Vauxhall Astra]]/[[Opel Kadett]]. [[Captive imports]] were the US car makers initial response to the increased demand for [[economy car]]s. The popularity of front-wheel drive began to gain momentum, with the 1981 [[Ford Escort (North America)|Ford Escort]], the 1982 [[Nissan Sentra]], and the 1983 [[Toyota Corolla]]. Front-wheel drive became the norm for mid-sized cars starting with the 1982 [[Chevrolet Celebrity]], 1982 [[Toyota Camry]], 1983 [[Dodge 600]], 1985 [[Nissan Maxima]], 1986 [[Honda Legend]], and the 1986 [[Ford Taurus]]. By the mid-1980s, most formerly rear-wheel-drive Japanese models were front-wheel drive, and by the mid-1990s, most American brands only sold a handful of rear-wheel-drive models.\n\n===1990{{spaced ndash}}present===\n[[File:Chevrolet Cobalt Coupe.jpg|thumb|The [[Chevrolet Cobalt]], a front-wheel-drive car made from 2004 to 2010]]\nThe vast majority of front-wheel-drive vehicles today use a [[Transverse engine|transversely mounted engine]] with \"end-on\" mounted transmission, driving the front wheels via driveshafts linked via [[Constant-velocity joint|constant velocity (CV) joints]], and a flexibly located electronically controlled cooling fan.
