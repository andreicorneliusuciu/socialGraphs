After the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]], the Canadarm was always paired with the [[Orbiter Boom Sensor System]] (OBSS), which was used to inspect the exterior of the Shuttle for damage to the [[Space shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]].\n\n==Development==\nIn 1969, [[Canada]] was invited by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) to participate in the [[Space Shuttle program]].<ref name=25Years/> At the time what that participation would entail had not yet been decided but a manipulator system was identified as an important component.<ref name=25Years/> Canadian company, DSMA Atcon, had developed a robot to load fuel into [[CANDU reactor|CANDU nuclear reactors]]; this robot attracted NASA's attention.<ref name=25Years/> In 1975, NASA and the [[National Research Council (Canada)|Canadian National Research Council]] (NRC) signed a memorandum of understanding that Canada would develop and construct the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqI6waJAUnEC&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Browsing Science Research at the Federal Level in Canada: History, Research Activities and Publications|last=Wilks|first=Brian|date=2004|publisher=University of Toronto Press|pages=117|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nNRC awarded the manipulator contract to [[Spar Aerospace]].<ref name=\"UofAEngMag\" /> Three systems were constructed within this design, development, test and evaluation contract: an engineering model to assist in the design and testing of the Canadarm, a qualification model that was subjected to environmental testing to qualify the design for use in space, and a flight unit. Frank Mee is credited as the inventor of the Canadarm End Effector. Its design was inspired by the opening and closing of a [[Diaphragm (optics)|camera's iris]].<ref name=25Years>{{cite book|last=Dotto|first=Lydia|others=David Steel|title=A Heritage of Excellence: 25 years at Spar Aerospace Limited|publisher=Spar Aerospace Limited|location=Canada|date=1992|pages=41\u201342|isbn=0-9696618-0-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YzVPAAAAMAAJ|quote=[Frank] Mee is the inventor of the Canadarm hand, technically known as the \"end effector\".}}</ref> <!--At his home, he fabricated a small model made out of cardboard and string; and brought it to work.<ref name=25Years/>--> His design won over the claw-like mechanisms that were being considered.<ref name=25Years/>\n\nThe main controls algorithms were developed by SPAR and by subcontractor [[Dynacon]] Inc. of [[Toronto]]. [[CAE Inc.|CAE Electronics]] Ltd. in [[Montreal]] provided the display and control panel and the hand controllers located in the Shuttle aft flight deck. Other electronic interfaces, servoamplifiers and power conditioners located on the Canadarm were designed and built by SPAR at its Montreal factory. The graphite composite boom that provides the structural connection between the shoulder and the elbow joint and the similar boom that connects the elbow to the wrist were produced by General Dynamics in the United States. Dilworth, Secord, Meagher and Associates, Ltd. in Toronto was contracted to produce the engineering model end effector then SPAR evolved the design and produced the qualification and flight units.The shuttle flight software that monitors and controls the Canadarm was developed in Houston, Texas, by the Federal Systems Division of [[IBM]]. Rockwell International's Space Transportation Systems Division designed, developed, tested and built the systems used to attach the Canadarm to the payload bay of the orbiter.\n\nAn acceptance ceremony for NASA was held at Spar's RMS Division in Toronto on the 11th of February 1981.<ref name=25Years/> Here [[Larkin Kerwin]], then the head of the NRC, gave the SRMS the informal name, Canadarm.<ref name=25Years/>\n\nThe first remote manipulator system was delivered to NASA in April 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/canadarm/canadarm_technical.html|title=The Shuttle Remote Manipulator System -- The Canadarm|publisher=IEEE Canada|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref> In all, five arms (arm 201, 202, 301, 302, and 303) were built and delivered to NASA. Arm 302 was lost in the Challenger accident.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/canadarm/flight.asp | publisher=Canada Space Agency | title= Flight History of Canadarm | date=28 October 2011 | accessdate=27 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Design and capabilities==\n[[File:Hubble First Servicing EVA - GPN-2000-001085.jpg|left|thumb|[[F. Story Musgrave]], anchored on the end of the Canadarm, prepares to be elevated to the top of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] during [[STS-61]].]]\nThe original Canadarm was capable of deploying and retrieving payloads [[mass|weighing]] up to {{convert|332.5|kg|abbr=on}} in space. In the mid-1990s the arm control system was redesigned to increase the payload capability to {{convert|3293|kg|abbr=on}} in order to support space station assembly operations. While able to maneuver payloads with the mass of a loaded bus in space, the arm motors cannot lift the arm's own weight when on the ground.<ref name=\"UofAEngMag\" /> NASA therefore developed a model of the arm for use at its training facility within the Johnson Space Center located in Houston, Texas. The Canadarm can also retrieve, repair and deploy satellites, provide a mobile extension ladder for extravehicular activity crew members for work stations or foot restraints, and be used as an inspection aid to allow the flight crew members to view the orbiter's or payload's surfaces through a television camera on the Canadarm.\n\nThe basic Canadarm configuration consists of a manipulator arm, a Canadarm display and control panel, including rotational and translational hand controllers at the orbiter aft flight deck flight crew station, and a manipulator controller interface unit that interfaces with the orbiter computer.  Most of the time, the arm operators see what they are doing by looking at the [[Advanced Space Vision System]] screen next to the controllers.\n[[File:Canadarm 1 End Effector.jpg|thumb|The Canadarm 1 End Effector]]\nOne crew member operates the Canadarm from the aft flight deck control station, and a second crew member usually assists with television camera operations. This allows the Canadarm operator to view Canadarm operations through the aft flight deck payload and overhead windows and through the closed-circuit television monitors at the aft flight deck station.\n\nThe Canadarm is outfitted with an explosive-based mechanism to allow the arm to be jettisoned. This safety system allows the Orbiter's payload bay doors to be closed in the event that the arm fails in an extended position and is not able to be retracted.<ref name=UofAEngMag>{{cite news | author=Garry Lindberg| title=Canadarm and its U of A Connections |url=http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/uofaengineer/article.cfm?article=28369&issue=28299|work=U of A Engineer Magazine |publisher=University of Alberta |accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Canadarm is {{convert|15.2|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|38|cm|abbr=on}} diameter with six [[Degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]]. It weighs {{convert|410|kg|abbr=on}} by itself, and {{convert|450|kg|abbr=on}} as part of the total system. The Canadarm has six joints that correspond roughly to the joints of the human arm, with shoulder yaw and pitch joints, an elbow pitch joint, and wrist pitch, yaw, and roll joints. The [[Robot end effector|end effector]] is the unit at the end of the wrist that grapples the payload's [[Grapple Fixture|grapple fixture]]. The two lightweight boom segments are called the upper and lower arms. The upper boom connects the shoulder and elbow joints, and the lower boom connects the elbow and wrist joints.{{Clear}}\n\n==Service History==\n[[File:STS-116 - P5 Truss hand-off to ISS (NASA S116-E-05765).jpg|thumb|315px|right|The Canadarm2 moves toward a P5 truss section, being held by Discovery's Canadarm, in preparation for a hand-off during [[STS-116]]]]\nA simulated Canadarm installed on the [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Space Shuttle ''Enterprise'']] was seen when the prototype orbiter's payload bay doors were open to test hangar facilities early in the shuttle program.<ref>{{cite news | author=Justin Ray | url=http://spaceflightnow.com/delta/d352/omcf/  | title=Vandenberg's space shuttle hangar | date=5 January 2011 | work=Space Flight Now | accessdate=27 October 2012}}</ref> The Canadarm was first tested in orbit in 1981, on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'''s]] [[STS-2]] mission.
