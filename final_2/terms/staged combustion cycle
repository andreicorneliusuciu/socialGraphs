In staged combustion, one propellant is sent through a preburner and partially burned using a small portion of the second propellant. The resulting hot gas is used to power the engine's turbines and pumps, then injected into the main combustion chamber along with the remainder of the second propellant to complete combustion. There are two main variants of the cycle depending on which propellant is sent through the preburner: oxidizer-rich staged combustion (ORSC) and fuel-rich staged combustion (FRSC).<ref name=accrosslinkmag-vol05nbr01 />\n\nThe advantage of staged, or \"closed\", combustion is that all of the cycle's gases and heat go through the combustion chamber. (An alternative design, called the [[Gas-generator cycle (rocket)|gas-generator cycle]], is an \"open\" cycle where the gas used to drive the turbopumps is exhausted overboard without passing through the main combustion chamber, reducing efficiency.) Since no propellant is dumped overboard, staged combustion allows for high power turbopumps which permit very high chamber pressures, allowing the use of high expansion ratio nozzles at low altitude for better performance. Disadvantages of staged combustion include harsh turbine conditions, exotic plumbing to carry the hot gases, and complicated feedback and control. In particular, ORSC requires advanced metallurgy due to extremely corrosive oxidizer-rich gas, while FRSC requires use of a fuel that will not coke, such as liquid hydrogen.\n\n==History==\nStaged combustion (''\u0417\u0430\u043c\u043a\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0445\u0435\u043c\u0430'') was first proposed by [[Aleksei Mihailovich Isaev|Alexey Isaev]] in 1949.  The first staged combustion engine was the [[S1.5400]] (11D33) used in the Soviet planetary rocket, designed by Melnikov, a former assistant to Isaev.<ref name=1st_re >George Sutton, \"History of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines\", 2006</ref>  About the same time (1959), [[Nikolai Dmitriyevich Kuznetsov|Nikolai Kuznetsov]] began work on the closed cycle engine [[NK-9]] for Korolev's orbital ICBM, GR-1.  Kuznetsov later evolved that design into the [[NK-15]] and [[NK-33]] engines for the unsuccessful Lunar [[N1 rocket]].\nThe non-cryogenic [[Dinitrogen tetroxide|N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>]]/[[Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine|UDMH]] engine [[RD-253]] using staged combustion was developed by [[Valentin Glushko]] around 1963 for the [[Proton rocket]].\n\nAfter the failure of the [[N1 (rocket)|N-1]], Kuznetsov had been ordered to destroy the NK-33 technology, but instead he warehoused dozens of the engines. In the 1990s, [[Aerojet]] was contacted and eventually visited Kuznetsov's plant. Upon meeting initial skepticism about the high specific impulse and other specifications, Kuznetsov shipped an engine to the US for testing.  Oxidizer-rich staged combustion had been considered by American engineers, but deemed impossible.<ref>''Cosmodrome'' History Channel, interviews with Aerojet and Kuznetsov engineers about the history of staged combustion</ref>\nThe Russian [[RD-180]] engine, purchased by [[Lockheed Martin]] (subsequently by [[United Launch Alliance]]) for the [[Atlas III rocket|Atlas III]] and [[Atlas V rocket|V]] rockets, also employs this technique.\n\nThe first laboratory staged-combustion test engine in the West was built in Germany in 1963, by [[Ludwig Boelkow]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n[[Hydrogen peroxide]]/[[kerosene]] fueled engines such as the British [[Gamma (Rocket engine)|Gamma]] of the 1950s may use a closed-cycle process by catalytically decomposing the peroxide to drive turbines ''before'' combustion with the kerosene in the combustion chamber proper. This gives the efficiency advantages of staged combustion, while avoiding major engineering problems.\n\nThe [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]] is another example of a staged combustion engine, and the first to use liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}  Its counterpart in the Soviet shuttle was the [[RD-0120]], similar in [[specific impulse]], thrust, and chamber pressure specification to the SSME, but with some differences that reduced complexity and cost at the expense of increased engine weight. \n{{Clear}}\n\n==Full-flow staged combustion cycle==\n[[Image:Full flow staged rocket cycle.png|thumb|right|260px|Full-flow staged combustion rocket cycle]]\n'''Full-flow staged combustion''' (FFSC) is a variation on the staged combustion cycle which uses both an oxidizer-rich and fuel-rich preburner, allowing use of the full flow of both propellants to power the turbines.<ref name=sippel2012/> The fuel [[turbopump]] is driven by the fuel-rich preburner, while the oxidizer-rich preburner drives the oxidizer turbopump.<ref name=accrosslinkmag-vol05nbr01 /><ref name=sippel2012>\n{{cite journal |last=Sippel|first=Martin |author2=Yamashiro, Ryoma |author3=Cremaschi, Francesco  |title=Staged Combustion Cycle Rocket Engine Design Trade-offs for Future Advanced Passenger Transport |url=http://elib.dlr.de/78208/1/Prop2012-2.pdf |journal=Space Propulsion 2012 |date=2012-05-10 |series=ST28-5 |accessdate=2014-03-19 |publisher=DLR-SART }}</ref> This eliminates the need for an interpropellant turbine seal normally required to separate oxidizer-rich gas from the fuel turbopump or fuel-rich gas from the oxidizer turbopump.<ref name=nsf20140307>\n{{cite news |last=Belluscio|first=Alejandro G. |title=SpaceX advances drive for Mars rocket via Raptor power |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/03/spacex-advances-drive-mars-rocket-raptor-power/ |accessdate=2014-03-09 |newspaper=NASAspaceflight.com |date=2014-03-07 }}</ref> The increased mass flow from FFSC allows both turbines to run cooler and at lower pressure, leading to a longer engine life and higher reliability.
