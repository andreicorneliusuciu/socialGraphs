It is also used when the local computer has a slow connection to the remote systems, but they have a fast connection between them. Without remote uploading functionality, the data would have to first be download to local host and then uploaded to the remote file hosting server, both times over slow connections.\n\n==Generally accepted use of the term \"upload\"==\nTo \"upload\" something is generally understood to mean, \"putting something on the internet\", for example, uploading photographs to [[facebook]].\nContributions to online-archives may also be referred to as \"uploads\", for example books, audit reports, [[fax]] transmission reports, etc..\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary|uploading}}\n*[[Download]]\n*[[Sideloading|Sideload]]\n*[[Bandwidth (computing)|Bandwidth]]\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|SVG upload icons}}\n\n[[Category:Computer networking]]\n[[Category:Data transmission]]\n[[Category:Network file transfer protocols]]\n[[Category:Servers (computing)]]"}]}}}}
