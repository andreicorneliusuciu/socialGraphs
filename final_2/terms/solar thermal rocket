The rocket would only have to carry the means of capturing solar energy, such as [[Concentrating solar power|concentrator]]s and [[mirror]]s. The heated propellant would be fed through a conventional [[rocket nozzle]] to produce thrust. Its engine thrust would be directly related to the surface area of the solar collector and to the local intensity of the solar radiation.\n\nIn the shorter term, solar thermal propulsion has been proposed both for longer-life, lower-cost and more-flexible cryogenic [[upper stage]] launch vehicles and for on-orbit [[propellant depot]]s.  Solar thermal propulsion is also a good candidate for use in reusable inter-orbital tugs,{{Citation needed (lead)|date=January 2011}} as it is a high-efficiency low-thrust system that can be refueled with relative ease.\n\n==Solar-thermal design concepts==\n\nThere are two basic solar thermal propulsion concepts, differing primarily in the method by which they use solar power to heat the propellant:{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n*Indirect solar heating involves pumping the propellant through passages in a [[heat exchanger]] that is heated by solar radiation. The windowless heat exchanger cavity concept is a design taking this radiation absorption approach.\n*Direct solar heating involves exposing the propellant directly to solar radiation. The rotating bed concept is one of the preferred concepts for direct solar radiation absorption; it offers higher [[specific impulse]] than other direct heating designs by using a retained seed ([[tantalum carbide]] or [[hafnium carbide]]) approach. The propellant flows through the porous walls of a rotating cylinder, picking up heat from the seeds, which are retained on the walls by the rotation. The [[carbide]]s are stable at high temperatures and have excellent heat transfer properties.\n\nDue to limitations in the temperature that heat exchanger materials can withstand (approximately 2800 [[Kelvin|K]]), the indirect absorption designs cannot achieve specific impulses beyond 900 seconds (9&nbsp;kN\u00b7s/kg = 9 km/s) (or up to 1000 seconds, see below). The direct absorption designs allow higher propellant temperatures and therefore higher specific impulses, approaching 1200 seconds. Even the lower specific impulse represents a significant increase over that of conventional [[chemical rocket]]s, however, an increase that can provide substantial payload gains (45 percent for a [[Low Earth orbit|LEO]]-to-[[Geosynchronous orbit|GEO]] mission) at the expense of increased trip time (14 days compared to 10 hours).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nSmall-scale hardware has been designed and fabricated for the [[Air Force Rocket Propulsion Laboratory]] (AFRPL) for ground test evaluation.<ref>[http://www.psicorp.com/pdf/library/sr-1228.pdf Solar Thermal Propulsion for Small Spacecraft - Engineering System Development and Evaluation PSI-SR-1228 publisher AIAA July 2005]</ref>  Systems with 10 to 100 N of thrust have been investigated by SART.<ref>[http://www.la.dlr.de/ra/sart/projects/sto/sto.php.en Webpage DLR Solar Thermal Propulsion of the Institut f\u00fcr Raumfahrtantriebe Abteilung Systemanalyse Raumtransport (SART) date = November 2006]</ref>\n\n==Propellants==\n\nMost proposed designs for solar thermal rockets use [[hydrogen]] as their propellant due to its low [[molecular weight]] which gives excellent [[specific impulse]] of up to 1000 seconds (10&nbsp;kN\u00b7s/kg) using heat exchangers made of rhenium.<ref name=ultramet_rhenium>{{cite web|last=Ultramet|title=Advanced Propulsion Concepts - Solar Thermal Propulsion|url=http://www.ultramet.com/propulsionsystem_components_advanced.html|publisher=Ultramet|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref> \n\nConventional thought has been that hydrogen\u2014although it gives excellent specific impulse\u2014is not space storable.  Recent design work has developed an approach to substantially reduce hydrogen boiloff, and to economically utilize the small remaining boiloff product for requisite in-space tasks, essentially achieving zero boil off (ZBO) from a practical point of view.<ref name=aiaa20100902_p5>Zegler and Kutter, 2010</ref>{{rp |p. 3,4,7}}\n\nOther substances could also be used. Water gives quite poor performance of 190 seconds (1.9&nbsp;kN\u00b7s/kg), but requires only simple equipment to purify and handle, and is space storable and this has very seriously been proposed for interplanetary use,{{By whom|date=January 2011}} [[In-situ resource utilization|using in-situ resources]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nAmmonia has been proposed as a propellant.{{By whom|date=January 2011}} It offers higher specific impulse than water, but is easily storable, with a boiling point of \u221277 degrees Celsius. The exhaust dissociates into hydrogen and nitrogen, leading to a lower average molecular weight, and thus a higher Isp (65% of hydrogen).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nA solar-thermal propulsion architecture outperforms architectures involving electrolysis and liquification of hydrogen from water by more than an order of magnitude, since electrolysis requires heavy power generators, whereas distillation only requires a simple and compact heat source (either nuclear or solar); so the propellant production rate is correspondingly far higher for any given initial mass of equipment. However its use does rely on having clear ideas of the location of water ice in the solar system, particularly on lunar and asteroidal bodies, and such information is not known, other than that the bodies with the [[asteroid belt]] and further from the Sun are expected to be rich in water ice.<ref name=zupper_moons>{{cite journal|last=Zuppero|first=Anthony|title=Propulsion to Moons of Jupiter Using Heat and Water Without Electrolysis Or Cryogenics|journal=Space Exploration 2005|year=2005|volume=001|series=SESI Conference Series|url=http://www.neofuel.com/2005.04.06-sesi-space2005/Zuppero%20SESI%20Space%202005%20per%20template.pdf|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|last=Zuppero|first=Anthony|title=new fuel: Near Earth Object fuel (Neofuel, using abundant off-earth resources for interplanetary transport)|url=http://www.neofuel.com|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Solar-thermal for ground launch==\n\nSolar thermal rockets have been proposed <ref>[http://www.newmars.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=2483 NewMars, Solar Thermal Tech for Ground Launch?]</ref>{{full|date=November 2012}} as a system for launching a small personal spacecraft into orbit. The design is based on a high altitude airship which uses its envelope to focus sunlight onto a tube. The propellant, which would likely be ammonia, is then fed through to produce thrust. Possible design flaws include whether the engine could produce enough thrust to overcome drag, and whether the skin of the airship wouldn't fail at hypersonic velocities. This has many similarities to the orbital airship proposed by [[JP Aerospace]].\n\n==Proposed solar-thermal space systems==\n{{as of|2010}}, two proposals for utilizing solar-thermal propulsion on in-space post-launch spacecraft systems have been made.\n\nA concept to provide [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) [[propellant depot]]s that could be used as way-stations for other spacecraft to stop and refuel on the way to beyond-LEO missions has proposed that waste gaseous [[hydrogen]]\u2014an inevitable byproduct of long-term [[liquid hydrogen]] storage in the [[Radiative heat transfer|radiative heat]] environment of [[outer space|space]]\u2014would be usable as a [[Monopropellant rocket|monopropellant]] in a solar-thermal propulsion system.  The waste hydrogen would be productively utilized for both [[orbital stationkeeping]] and [[attitude control]], as well as providing limited propellant and thrust to use for [[Orbital_maneuver#Non-impulsive_maneuvers|orbital maneuvers]] to better [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]] with other spacecraft that would be inbound to receive fuel from the depot.<ref name=aiaa20100902>\n{{cite web|last=Zegler|first=Frank |title=Evolving to a Depot-Based Space Transportation Architecture |url=http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/docs/publications/DepotBasedTransportationArchitecture2010.pdf |work=AIAA SPACE 2010 Conference & Exposition |publisher=AIAA |accessdate=2011-01-25 |author2=Bernard Kutter  |date=2010-09-02  |page=3 |quote=the waste hydrogen that has boiled off happens to be the best known propellant (as a monopropellant in a basic solar-thermal propulsion system) for this task.

The [[Advanced Common Evolved Stage]] (ACES) is intended as a lower-cost, more-capable and more-flexible upper stage that would supplement, and perhaps replace, the existing ULA [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] and ULA [[Delta_IV#Vehicle_description|Delta Cryogenic Second Stage]] (DCSS) upper stage vehicles.  The ACES [[Integrated Vehicle Fluids]] option eliminates all [[hydrazine]] monopropellant and all [[helium]] pressurant from the space vehicle\u2014normally used for attitude control and station keeping\u2014and depends instead on solar-thermal monoprop thrusters using waste hydrogen.<ref name=aiaa20100902_p5/>{{rp |p. 5}}\n\nThe viability of various trips using Solar Thermal propulsion was investigated by Gordon Woodcock and Dave Byers in 2003<ref name=AIAA20035029>{{cite journal|last=Byers|first=Woodcock |title=Results of Evaluation of Solar Thermal Propulsion, AIAA 2003-5029 |publisher=AIAA |year=2003}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.psicorp.com/publications/PDF/sr-1228.pdf Solar Thermal Propulsion for Small Spacecraft - Engineering System Development and Evaluation (2005)]\n*[http://www.pw.utc.com/vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=689e6792dffba110VgnVCM100000c45a529fRCRD&vgnextchannel=7dfc34890cb06110VgnVCM1000004601000aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne Wins $2.2 Million Contract Option for Solar Thermal Propulsion Rocket Engine] (Press release, June 25, 2008, Pratt & Whitney [[Rocketdyne]])\n\n{{spacecraft propulsion}}\n\n[[Category:Rocket propulsion]]\n[[Category:Solar power|Thermal rocket]]"}]}}}}
