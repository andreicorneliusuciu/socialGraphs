It is an important quantity in physics because it is a [[Conservation law|conserved quantity]] \u2013 the angular momentum of a system remains constant unless acted on by an external [[torque]].\n\nThe definition of angular momentum for a [[point particle]] is a [[pseudovector]] '''r'''\u00d7'''p''', the [[cross product]] of the particle's [[position vector]] '''r''' (relative to some origin) and its [[momentum vector]] '''p''' = ''m'''''v'''. This definition can be applied to each point in [[Continuum mechanics|continua]] like solids or fluids, or [[field (physics)|physical fields]]. Unlike momentum, angular momentum does depend on where the origin is chosen, since the particle's position is measured from it. The angular momentum of an object can also be connected to the [[angular velocity]] '''\u03c9''' of the object (how fast it rotates about an axis) via the [[moment of inertia]] ''I'' (which depends on the shape and distribution of mass about the axis of rotation). However, while '''\u03c9''' always points in the direction of the rotation axis, the angular momentum '''L''' may point in a ''different'' direction depending on how the mass is distributed.\n\nAngular momentum is additive; the total angular momentum of a system is the (pseudo)[[vector sum]] of the angular momenta. For continua or fields one uses [[Integral|integration]]. The total angular momentum of anything can always be split into the sum of two main components: \"orbital\" angular momentum about an axis outside the object, plus \"spin\" angular momentum through the [[centre of mass]] of the object.\n\nTorque can be defined as the rate of change of angular momentum, analogous to [[force]]. The conservation of angular momentum helps explain many observed phenomena, for example the increase in rotational speed of a spinning [[figure skater]] as the skater's arms are contracted, the high rotational rates of [[neutron star]]s, the [[falling cat problem]], and [[precession]] of tops and gyros. Applications include the [[gyrocompass]], [[control moment gyroscope]], [[Inertial navigation system|inertial guidance systems]], [[reaction wheel]]s, [[Flying disc|flying discs or Frisbees]] and [[Earth's rotation]] to name a few. In general, conservation does limit the possible motion of a system, but does not uniquely determine what the exact motion is.\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], [[angular momentum operator|angular momentum is an operator]] with quantized eigenvalues. Angular momentum is subject to the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], meaning only one component can be measured with definite precision, the other two cannot. Also, the \"[[spin (physics)|spin]]\" of [[elementary particle]]s does not correspond to literal spinning motion.\n\n== Angular momentum in classical mechanics ==\n\n=== Definition ===\n{{Main|Scalar (physics)|Euclidean vector}}\n\n==== Scalar \u2014 angular momentum in two dimensions ====\n[[File:Ang mom 2d.png|right|thumb|[[Velocity]] of the [[particle]] ''m'' with respect to the origin ''O'' can be resolved into components parallel to (''v''<sub>//</sub>) and perpendicular to (''v''<sub>\u22a5</sub>) the radius vector ''r''.

For instance, a particle of matter at the outer edge of a wheel is, in effect, at the end of a [[lever]] of the same length as the wheel's radius, its momentum turning the lever about the center point. This imaginary lever is known as the ''moment arm''.

If the net force on some body is directed always toward some point, the ''center'', then there is no torque on the body with respect to the center, as all of the force is directed along the [[Position (vector)|radius vector]], and none is [[perpendicular]] to the radius. Mathematically, torque <math>\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{0}, </math> because in this case <math>\\mathbf{r}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{F}</math> are parallel vectors. Therefore, the angular momentum of the body about the center is constant. This is the case with [[gravity|gravitational attraction]] in the [[orbit]]s of [[planet]]s and [[satellite]]s, where the gravitational force is always directed toward the primary body and orbiting bodies conserve angular momentum by exchanging distance and velocity as they move about the primary. Central force motion is also used in the analysis of the [[Bohr model]] of the [[atom]].\n\nFor a planet, angular momentum is distributed between the spin of the planet and its revolution in its orbit, and these are often exchanged by various mechanisms. The conservation of angular momentum in the [[Lunar theory|Earth\u2013Moon system]] results in the transfer of angular momentum from Earth to Moon, due to [[Tidal acceleration|tidal torque]] the Moon exerts on the Earth. This in turn results in the slowing down of the rotation rate of Earth, at about 65.7 nanoseconds per day,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/313/1524/47\n| title      =Long-term changes in the rotation of the earth \u2013 700 B.C. to A.D. 1980\n|work = Philosophical Transactions Royal Society\n|volume = 313\n| issue      =1524\n| last1       =Stephenson\n| first1      =F.

By bringing part of the mass of her body closer to the axis she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is the product of [[moment of inertia]] and [[angular velocity]], if the angular momentum remains constant (is conserved), then the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater must increase.\n\nThe same phenomenon results in extremely fast spin of compact stars (like [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s) when they are formed out of much larger and slower rotating stars. Decrease in the size of an object ''n'' times results in increase of its angular velocity by the factor of ''n''<sup>2</sup>.\n\nConservation is not always full explanation for the dynamics of a system but a key constraint. For example, a spinning [[top]] is subject to a gravitational torque making it lean over and change the angular momentum about the [[nutation]] axis, but neglecting friction at the point of spinning contact, it has a conserved angular momentum about its spinning axis, and another about its [[precession]] axis. Also, in any [[planetary system]], the planets, star(s), comets, and asteroids can all move in numerous complicated ways, but only so that the angular momentum of the system is conserved.\n\n[[Noether's theorem]] states that every [[conservation law]] is associated with a [[symmetry]] (invariant) of the underlying physics.  The symmetry associated with conservation of angular momentum is [[rotational invariance]].  The fact that the physics of a system is unchanged if it is rotated by any angle about an axis implies that angular momentum is conserved.<ref>{{cite book| title=The classical theory of fields|series=Course of Theoretical Physics|first1= L.

In this formalism, angular momentum is the [[2-form]] [[Noether charge]] associated with rotational invariance. As a result, angular momentum is not conserved for general [[curved space]]times, unless it happens to be asymptotically rotationally invariant.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nIn classical mechanics, the angular momentum of a particle can be reinterpreted as a plane element:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{r} \\wedge \\mathbf{p} \\,, </math>\n\nin which the [[exterior product]] \u2227 replaces the [[cross product]] \u00d7 (these products have similar characteristics but are nonequivalent). This has the advantage of a clearer geometric interpretation as a plane element, defined from the '''x''' and '''p'''  vectors, and the expression is true in any number of dimensions (two or higher). In Cartesian coordinates:\n\n:<math> \\begin{array}{rl}\\mathbf{L} & =\\left(xp_{y}-yp_{x}\\right)\\mathbf{e}_{x}\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_{y}+\\left(yp_{z}-zp_{y}\\right)\\mathbf{e}_{y}\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_{z}+\\left(zp_{x}-xp_{z}\\right)\\mathbf{e}_{z}\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_{x}\\\\ & =L_{xy}\\mathbf{e}_{x}\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_{y}+L_{yz}\\mathbf{e}_{y}\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_{z}+L_{zx}\\mathbf{e}_{z}\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_{x} \\,, \\end{array} </math>\n\nor more compactly in index notation:\n\n:<math>L_{ij}=x_{i}p_{j}-x_{j}p_{i}\\,.</math>\n\nThe angular velocity can also be defined as an antisymmetric second order tensor, with components ''\u03c9<sub>ij</sub>''. The relation between the two antisymmetric tensors is given by the moment of inertia which must now be a fourth order tensor:<ref>Synge and Schild, Tensor calculus, Dover publications, 1978 edition, p. 161.  ISBN 978-0-486-63612-2.</ref>\n\n:<math>L_{ij} = I_{ijk\\ell} \\omega_{k\\ell} \\,. </math>\n\nAgain, this equation in '''L''' and '''\u03c9''' as tensors is true in any number of dimensions. This equation also appears in the [[geometric algebra]] formalism, in which '''L''' and '''\u03c9''' are bivectors, and the moment of inertia is a mapping between them.\n\nIn [[relativistic mechanics]], the [[relativistic angular momentum]] of a particle is expressed as an [[antisymmetric tensor]] of second order:\n\n:<math> M_{\\alpha\\beta} = X_\\alpha\\ P_\\beta - X_\\beta P_\\alpha </math>\n\nin the language of [[four-vector]]s, namely the [[Four-position|four position]] ''X'' and the [[four momentum]] ''P'', and absorbs the above '''L''' together with the motion of the [[centre of mass]] of the particle.\n\nIn each of the above cases, for a system of particles, the total angular momentum is just the sum of the individual particle angular momenta, and the centre of mass is for the system.\n\n== Angular momentum in quantum mechanics ==\n{{Main|Angular momentum operator}}\nAngular momentum in [[quantum mechanics]] differs in many profound respects from angular momentum in [[classical mechanics]].

'''L''' is then an [[Operator (physics)|operator]], specifically called the ''[[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum operator]]''.\n\nHowever, in quantum physics, there is another type of angular momentum, called ''[[spin (physics)|spin angular momentum]]'', represented by the spin operator '''S'''. Almost all [[elementary particle]]s have spin. Spin is often depicted as a particle literally spinning around an axis, but this is a misleading and inaccurate picture: spin is an intrinsic property of a particle, unrelated to any sort of motion in space and fundamentally different from orbital angular momentum. All [[elementary particles]] have a characteristic spin, for example [[electron]]s have \"spin 1/2\" (this actually means \"spin [[reduced Planck constant|\u0127]]/2\") while [[photon]]s   have \"spin 1\" (this actually means \"spin \u0127\").\n\nFinally, there is [[total angular momentum]] '''J''', which combines both the spin and orbital angular momentum of all particles and fields. (For one particle, '''J''' = '''L''' + '''S'''.) [[Conservation of angular momentum]] applies to '''J''', but not to '''L''' or '''S'''; for example, the [[spin\u2013orbit interaction]] allows angular momentum to transfer back and forth between '''L''' and '''S''', with the total remaining constant.

A standing wave like this can have 0,1,2, or any integer number of wavelengths around the circle, but it ''cannot'' have a non-integer number of wavelengths like 8.3. In quantum mechanics, angular momentum is quantized for a similar reason.]]\n(There are additional restrictions as well, see [[angular momentum operator]] for details.)\n\nThe [[reduced Planck constant]] <math>\\hbar</math> is tiny by everyday standards, about 10<sup>\u221234</sup> [[Joule-second|J s]], and therefore this quantization does not noticeably affect the angular momentum of macroscopic objects. However, it is very important in the microscopic world. For example, the structure of [[electron shell]]s and subshells in chemistry is significantly affected by the quantization of angular momentum.\n\nQuantization of angular momentum was first postulated by [[Niels Bohr]] in his [[Bohr model]] of the atom and was later predicted by [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] in his [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation#Quantization|Schr\u00f6dinger equation]].\n\n=== Uncertainty ===\nIn the definition <math>\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{r}\\times\\mathbf{p}</math>, six operators are involved: The [[position operator]]s <math>r_x</math>, <math>r_y</math>, <math>r_z</math>, and the [[momentum operator]]s <math>p_x</math>, <math>p_y</math>, <math>p_z</math>. However, the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] tells us that it is not possible for all six of these quantities to be known simultaneously with arbitrary precision. Therefore, there are limits to what can be known or measured about a particle's angular momentum. It turns out that the best that one can do is to simultaneously measure both the angular momentum vector's [[magnitude (vector)|magnitude]] and its component along one axis.\n\nThe uncertainty is closely related to the fact that different components of an [[angular momentum operator]] do not [[commutator|commute]], for example <math>L_xL_y \\neq L_yL_x</math>. (For the precise [[commutation relation]]s, see [[angular momentum operator]].)\n\n=== Total angular momentum as generator of rotations ===\nAs mentioned above, orbital angular momentum '''L''' is defined as in classical mechanics: <math>\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{r}\\times\\mathbf{p}</math>, but ''total'' angular momentum '''J''' is defined in a different, more basic way: '''J''' is defined as the \"generator of rotations\".<ref name=littlejohn>{{cite web|url=http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/1011/notes/spinrot.pdf|title= Lecture notes on rotations in quantum mechanics|first= Robert |last=Littlejohn|accessdate= 13 Jan 2012|work=Physics 221B Spring 2011|year=2011}}</ref> More specifically, '''J''' is defined so that the operator\n:<math>R(\\hat{n},\\phi) \\equiv \\exp\\left(-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\phi\\, \\mathbf{J}\\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}\\right)</math>\nis the [[Rotation operator (quantum mechanics)|rotation operator]] that takes any system and rotates it by angle <math>\\phi</math> about the axis <math>\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}</math>. (The \"exp\" in the formula refers to [[matrix exponential|operator exponential]])\n\nThe relationship between the angular momentum operator and the rotation operators is the same as the relationship between [[lie algebra]]s and [[lie group]]s in mathematics. The close relationship between angular momentum and rotations is reflected in [[Noether's theorem]] that proves that angular momentum is conserved whenever the laws of physics are rotationally invariant.\n\n== Angular momentum in electrodynamics ==\n{{See also|Momentum#Particle in field|l1=Momentum (Particle in field)}}\n\nWhen describing the motion of a [[charged particle]] in an [[electromagnetic field]], the [[canonical momentum]] '''P''' (derived from the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] for this system) is not [[gauge invariant]]. As a consequence, the canonical angular momentum '''L''' = '''r''' \u00d7 '''P''' is not gauge invariant either. Instead, the momentum that is physical, the so-called ''kinetic momentum'' (used throughout this article), is (in [[SI units]])\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{p} = m\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{P} - e \\mathbf{A} </math>\n\nwhere ''e'' is the [[electric charge]] of the particle and '''A''' the [[magnetic vector potential]] of the electromagnetic field.

But these are cases which I do not consider in what follows; and it would be too tedious to demonstrate every particular that relates to this subject.''<ref>Newton, Axioms; or Laws of Motion, Corollary III</ref>\nHowever, his geometric proof of the [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Second law|Law of Areas]] is an outstanding example of Newton's genius, and indirectly proves angular momentum conservation in the case of a [[central force]].\n\n=== The Law of Areas ===\n{{Main|Classical central-force problem|Areal velocity}}\n\n==== Newton's derivation ====\n[[File:Newton area law derivation.gif|frame|right|Newton's derivation of the area law using geometric means.]]\n\nAs a [[planet]] orbits the [[Sun]], the line between the Sun and the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time. This had been known since [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] expounded his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Second Law of Planetary Motion]]. Newton derived a unique geometric proof, and went on to show that the attractive force of the Sun's [[gravity]] was the cause of all of Kepler's laws.\n\nDuring the first interval of time, an object is in motion from point '''A''' to point '''B'''. Undisturbed, it would continue to point '''c''' during the second interval. When the object arrives at '''B''', it receives an impulse directed toward point '''S'''. The impulse gives it a small added velocity toward '''S''', such that if this were its only velocity, it would move from '''B''' to '''V''' during the second interval. By the [[Parallelogram of force|rules of velocity composition]], these two velocities add, and point '''C''' is found by construction of parallelogram '''BcCV'''. Thus the object's path is deflected by the impulse so that it arrives at point '''C''' at the end of the second interval. Because the triangles '''SBc''' and '''SBC''' have the same base '''SB''' and the same height '''Bc''' or '''VC''', they have the same area. By symmetry, triangle '''SBc''' also has the same area as triangle '''SAB''', therefore the object has swept out equal areas '''SAB''' and '''SBC''' in equal times.\n\nAt point '''C''', the object receives another impulse toward '''S''', again deflecting its path during the third interval from '''d''' to '''D'''. Thus it continues to '''E''' and beyond, the triangles '''SAB''', '''SBc''', '''SBC''', '''SCd''', '''SCD''', '''SDe''', '''SDE''' all having the same area. Allowing the time intervals to become ever smaller, the path '''ABCDE''' approaches indefinitely close to a continuous curve.\n\nNote that because this derivation is geometric, and no specific force is applied, it proves a more general law than Kepler's Second Law of Planetary Motion. It shows that the Law of Areas applies to any central force, attractive or repulsive, continuous or non-continuous, or zero.\n\n==== Conservation of angular momentum in the Law of Areas ====\nThe proportionality of angular momentum to the area swept out by a moving object can be understood by realizing that the bases of the triangles, that is, the lines from '''S''' to the object, are equivalent to the [[Angular momentum#Scalar \u2013 angular momentum in two dimensions|radius {{math|<var>r</var>}}]], and that the heights of the triangles are proportional to the perpendicular component of [[Angular momentum#Scalar \u2013 angular momentum in two dimensions|velocity {{math|<VAR>v</var><sub>\u22a5</sub>}}]]. Hence, if the area swept per unit time is constant, then by the triangular area formula {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}(base)(height)}}, the product {{math|(base)(height)}} and therefore the product {{math|<VAR>rv</var><sub>\u22a5</sub>}} are constant: if {{math|<VAR>r</var>}} and the base length are decreased, {{math|<VAR>v</var><sub>\u22a5</sub>}} and height must increase proportionally. Mass is constant, therefore [[Angular momentum#Scalar \u2013 angular momentum in two dimensions|angular momentum {{math|<VAR>rmv</var><sub>\u22a5</sub>}}]] is conserved by this exchange of distance and velocity.\n\nIn the case of triangle '''SBC''', area is equal to {{sfrac|1|2}}('''SB''')('''VC'''). Wherever '''C''' is eventually located due to the impulse applied at '''B''', the product ('''SB''')('''VC'''), and therefore {{math|<VAR>rmv</var><sub>\u22a5</sub>}} remain constant. Similarly so for each of the triangles.\n\n=== After Newton ===\n[[Leonhard Euler]], [[Daniel Bernoulli]], and [[Patrick d'Arcy]] all understood angular momentum in terms of conservation of [[areal velocity]], a result of their analysis of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Second law|Kepler's Second Law]] of planetary motion. It is unlikely that they realized the implications for ordinary rotating matter.<ref>see {{cite web\n|url=http://weatherglass.de/PDFs/Angular_momentum.pdf\n|last=Borrelli\n|first=Arianna\n|date=2011\n|title=Angular momentum between physics and mathematics}} for an excellent and detailed summary of the concept of angular momentum through history.</ref>\n\nIn 1736 Euler, like Newton, touched on some of the equations of angular momentum in his ''[[Mechanica]]'' without further developing them.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/mechanica1.html\n|title=Euler : Mechanica Vol. 1\n|last=Bruce\n|first=Ian\n|date=2008}}</ref>\n\nBernoulli wrote in a 1744 letter of a \"moment of rotational motion\", possibly the first conception of angular momentum as we now understand it.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://eulerarchive.maa.org/correspondence/letters/OO0153.pdf\n|title=Euler's Correspondence with Daniel Bernoulli, Bernoulli to Euler, 04 February, 1744}}, at [http://eulerarchive.maa.org/ The Euler Archive]</ref>\n\nIn 1799, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] first realized that a fixed plane was associated with rotation \u2014 his ''[[invariable plane]]''.\n\n[[Louis Poinsot]] in 1803 began representing rotations as a line segment perpendicular to the rotation, and elaborated on the \"conservation of moments\".\n\nIn 1852 [[L\u00e9on Foucault]] used a [[gyroscope]] in an experiment to display the Earth's rotation.\n\n[[William John Macquorn Rankine|William J. M. Rankine's]] 1858 ''Manual of Applied Mechanics'' defined angular momentum in the modern sense for the first time:\n:''...a line whose length is proportional to the magnitude of the angular momentum, and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of motion of the body and of the fixed point, and such, that when the motion of the body is viewed from the extremity of the line, the radius-vector of the body seems to have right-handed rotation.''\n\nIn an 1872 edition of the same book, Rankine stated that \"The term ''angular momentum'' was introduced by Mr. Hayward,\"<ref>{{cite book\n|last1 = Rankine\n|first1 = W.
