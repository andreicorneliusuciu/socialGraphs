Negative feedback tends to promote a settling to [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]], and reduces the effects of perturbations. Negative [[feedback loop]]s in which just the right amount of correction is applied with optimum timing can be very stable, accurate, and responsive.\n\nNegative feedback is widely used in mechanical and electronic engineering, but it also occurs naturally within living organisms,<ref name=Ashby>\n{{cite book |title=Introduction to cybernetics |chapter=Chapter 12: The error-controlled regulator |author=W.

In many implementations the generated waveform is the output, but when used as a [[demodulator]] in a [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio receiver, the error feedback voltage serves as the demodulated output signal. If there is a [[frequency divider]] between the generated waveform and the phase comparator, the device acts as a [[frequency multiplier]].\n* In [[organisms]], feedback enables various measures (e.g. body temperature, or [[blood sugar]] level) to be maintained within a desired range by [[homeostatic]] processes.\n\n== History ==\nNegative feedback as a control technique may be seen in the refinements of the [[water clock]] introduced by [[Ctesibius|Ktesibios]] of Alexandria in the 3rd century BCE. Self-regulating mechanisms have existed since antiquity, and were used to maintain a constant level in the reservoirs of water clocks as early as 200 BCE.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Breedveld | first1 = Peter C | year = 2004 | title = Port-based modeling of mechatronic systems | url = | journal = Mathematics and Computers in Simulation | volume = 66 | issue = 2| pages = 99\u2013128 | doi=10.1016/j.matcom.2003.11.002}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Centrifugal governor.png|thumb|The [[Centrifugal governor|fly-ball governor]] is an early example of negative feedback.]]\nNegative feedback was implemented in the 17th Century.

For example, in biochemistry, one set of chemicals drives the system in a given direction, whereas another set of chemicals drives it in an opposing direction. If one or both of these opposing influences are non-linear, equilibrium point(s) result.\n\nIn [[biology]], this process (in general, [[biochemistry|biochemical]]) is often referred to as [[homeostasis]]; whereas in [[mechanics]], the more common term is [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]].\n\nIn [[engineering]], [[mathematics]] and the physical, and biological sciences, common terms for the points around which the system gravitates include: attractors, [[stability theory|stable]] states, eigenstates/eigenfunctions, equilibrium points, and [[setpoint (control system)|setpoint]]s.\n\nIn [[control theory]], ''negative'' refers to the sign of the multiplier in mathematical models for feedback. In delta notation, \u2212\u0394output is added to or mixed into the input. In multivariate systems, vectors help to illustrate how several influences can both partially complement and partially oppose each other.<ref name=mindell/>\n\nSome authors, in particular with respect to modelling [[System dynamics|business systems]], use ''negative'' to refer to the reduction in difference between the desired and actual behavior of a system.<ref name=\"Ramaprasad\">{{cite journal |author=Arkalgud Ramaprasad |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bs.3830280103/abstract |title=On The Definition of Feedback |journal=Behavioral Science |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=4\u201313 |year=1983 |doi=10.1002/bs.3830280103}}</ref><ref name=Sterman>\nJohn D.Sterman, ''Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World'' McGraw Hill/Irwin, 2000.

Any system in which there is positive feedback together with a gain greater than one will result in a runaway situation. Both positive and negative feedback require a feedback loop to operate.\n\nHowever, negative feedback systems can still be subject to oscillations. This is caused by the slight delays around any loop. Due to these delays the feedback signal of some frequencies can arrive one half cycle later which will have a similar effect to positive feedback and these frequencies can reinforce themselves and grow over time. This problem is often dealt with by attenuating or changing the phase of the problematic frequencies. Unless the system naturally has sufficient damping, many negative feedback systems have [[low pass filter]]s or [[dashpot|dampers]] fitted.\n\n== Some specific implementations ==\nThere are a large number of different examples of negative feedback and some are discussed below.\n\n===Error-controlled regulation===\n{{See also|Control engineering|Homeostasis|Allostasis}}\n[[File:Regulator with feedback.png|thumb|200px|A regulator ''R'' adjusts the input to a system ''T'' so the monitored essential variables ''E'' are held to set-point values ''S'' that result in the desired system output despite disturbances ''D''.<ref name=Ashby/><ref name=Bhagade>\n{{cite book |title=Process Dynamics and Control |author1=Sudheer S Bhagade |author2=Govind Das Nageshwar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0xPl56hZEC&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false  |isbn=9788120344051 |year=2011 |publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

So, for example, a change in weather may cause a disturbance to the ''heat'' input to a house (as an example of the system ''T'') that is monitored by a thermometer as a change in ''temperature'' (as an example of an 'essential variable' ''E''), converted by the thermostat (a 'comparator') into an ''electrical'' error in status compared to the 'set point' ''S'', and subsequently used by the regulator (containing a 'controller' that commands ''gas'' control valves and an ignitor) ultimately to change the ''heat'' provided by a furnace (an 'effector') to counter the initial weather-related disturbance in heat input to the house.\n\nError controlled regulation is typically carried out using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller ([[PID controller]]). The regulator signal is derived from a weighted sum of the error signal, integral of the error signal, and derivative of the error signal. The weights of the respective components depend on the application.<ref name=Bechhoefer>{{cite journal | last = Bechhoefer | first = John | title = Feedback for Physicists: A Tutorial Essay On Control | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | pages = 783\u2013835 | publisher = APS Physics | url = http://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.77.783 | doi=10.1103/revmodphys.77.783}}\n</ref>\n\nMathematically, the regulator signal is given by:\n:<math>\\mathrm{MV(t)}=K_p\\left(\\,{e(t)} + \\frac{1}{T_i}\\int_{0}^{t}{e(\\tau)}\\,{d\\tau} + T_d\\frac{d}{dt}e(t)\\right)</math>\nwhere\n:<math>T_i</math>  is the ''integral time''\n:<math>T_d</math>  is the ''derivative time''\n\n===Negative feedback amplifier===\n{{main article|Negative feedback amplifier}}\nThe negative feedback amplifier was invented by [[Harold Stephen Black]] at [[Bell Laboratories]] in 1927, and granted a patent in 1937 ([http://www.sos.siena.edu/~aweatherwax/electronics/black_patent.pdf US Patent 2,102,671] \"a continuation of application Serial No. 298,155, filed August 8, 1928 ...\").<ref name=Brittain>\n{{cite journal |author=James E Brittain |title=Electrical engineering hall of fame: Harold S Black |journal=Proceedings IEEE |date=February 2011 |issue=2 |volume=99 |pages=351\u2013353 |url=http://www.ieee.org/documents/proc_scanpast0211.pdf |doi=10.1109/jproc.2010.2090997}}\n</ref><ref name=Desoer>\n{{cite journal |author=CA Desoer |title=In Memoriam: Harold Stephen Black |journal=IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control |volume=AC-29 |number=8 |date=August 1984 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1103645 }}</ref>\n:\"The patent is 52 pages long plus 35 pages of figures.

Since the open-loop gain of an op-amp is extremely large, a small differential input signal would drive the output of the amplifier to one rail or the other in the absence of negative feedback. A simple example of the use of feedback is the op-amp voltage amplifier shown in the figure.\n\nThe idealized model of an operational amplifier assumes that the gain is infinite, the input impedance is infinite, output resistance is zero, and input offset currents and voltages are zero. Such an ideal amplifier draws no current from the resistor divider.<ref name=Schitter>\n{{cite book |title=The Design of High Performance Mechatronics |author1=G. Schitter |author2=A.

In addition, it exhibits a finite input impedance and a non-zero output impedance. Although practical op-amps are not ideal, the model of an ideal op-amp often suffices to understand circuit operation at low enough frequencies. \nAs discussed in the previous section, the feedback circuit stabilizes the closed-loop gain and desensitizes the output to fluctuations generated inside the amplifier itself.<ref name= Jung>\n{{cite book |title=Op Amp Applications Handbook |author=Walter G Jung |chapter=Noise gain (NG) |pages=12 ''ff'' |isbn=9780750678445 |year=2005 |publisher=Newnes |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dunqt1rt4sAC&pg=PA12&dq=%22Including+the+effects+of+finite+op+amp+gain,%22#v=onepage&q=%22Including%20the%20effects%20of%20finite%20op%20amp%20gain%2C%22&f=false}} \n</ref>\n\n=== Mechanical engineering ===\n{{See also|Control systems|Control engineering}}\n[[File:Ballcock.svg|thumb|The [[ballcock]] or float valve uses negative feedback to control the water level in a cistern.]]\nAn example of the use of negative feedback control is the [[ballcock]] control of water level (see diagram). In modern engineering, negative feedback loops are found in [[fuel injection]] systems and [[carburettor]]s. Similar control mechanisms are used in heating and cooling systems, such as those involving [[air conditioners]], [[refrigerators]], or [[freezers]].\n\n=== Biology and chemistry ===\n\n[[Image:ACTH Negative Feedback.svg|thumb|250pc|Control of endocrine hormones by negative feedback.]]\n\nSome biological systems exhibit negative feedback such as the [[baroreflex]] in [[blood pressure]] regulation and [[erythropoiesis]]. Many biological process (e.g., in the [[human anatomy]]) use negative feedback. Examples of this are numerous, from the regulating of body temperature, to the regulating of blood [[glucose]] levels. The disruption of feedback loops can lead to undesirable results: in the case of blood glucose levels, if negative feedback fails, the glucose levels in the blood may begin to rise dramatically, thus resulting in [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]].\n\nFor hormone secretion regulated by the negative feedback loop: when gland X releases hormone X, this stimulates target cells to release hormone Y. When there is an excess of hormone Y, gland X \"senses\" this and inhibits its release of hormone X. As shown in the figure, most [[endocrine]] [[hormone]]s are controlled by a [[physiology|physiologic]] negative feedback inhibition loop, such as the [[glucocorticoid]]s secreted by the [[adrenal cortex]].  The [[hypothalamus]] secretes [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone|corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)]], which directs the [[pituitary gland|anterior pituitary gland]] to secrete [[ACTH|adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)]].  In turn, ACTH directs the adrenal cortex to secrete glucocorticoids, such as [[cortisol]].  Glucocorticoids not only perform their respective functions throughout the body but also negatively affect the release of further stimulating secretions of both the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, effectively reducing the output of glucocorticoids once a sufficient amount has been released.<ref>Raven, PH; Johnson, GB.
