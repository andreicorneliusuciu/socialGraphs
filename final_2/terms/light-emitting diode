Modern LEDs are available across the [[visible spectrum|visible]], [[ultraviolet]], and [[infrared]] wavelengths, with very high brightness.\n\nEarly LEDs were often used as indicator lamps for electronic devices, replacing small incandescent bulbs. They were soon packaged into numeric readouts in the form of [[seven-segment display]]s, and were commonly seen in digital clocks.\n\nRecent developments in LEDs permit them to be used in environmental and task lighting. LEDs have many advantages over incandescent light sources including lower energy consumption, longer lifetime, improved physical robustness, smaller size, and faster switching. Light-emitting diodes are now used in applications as diverse as [[navigation light#Aviation navigation lights|aviation lighting]], [[automotive lighting#Light emitting diodes (LED)|automotive headlamps]], advertising, [[Lighting|general lighting]], [[traffic signal]]s, camera flashes and lighted wallpaper. {{As of|2016}}, LEDs powerful enough for room lighting remain somewhat more expensive, and require more precise current and heat management, than compact [[fluorescent lamp]] sources of comparable output. They are, however, significantly more energy efficient and, arguably, have fewer environmental concerns linked to their disposal{{Citation needed|reason=facts please|date=September 2016}}\n. The governments of some countries are promoting the domestic use of LED-based lighting, and in some cases providing LED-based lighting solutions to the public at subsidized rates.\n\nLEDs have allowed new displays and sensors to be developed, while their high switching rates are also used in advanced communications technology.\n\n==History==\n\n===Discoveries and early devices===\n[[File:SiC LED historic.jpg|thumb|Green electroluminescence from a point contact on a crystal of [[silicon carbide|SiC]] recreates [[H.

In this device a {{chem|Y|3|Al|5|O|12}}:Ce (known as \"[[YAG]]\") phosphor coating on the emitter absorbs some of the blue emission and produces yellow light through [[fluorescence]]. The combination of that yellow with remaining blue light appears white to the eye. However, using different [[phosphor]]s (fluorescent materials) it also became possible to instead produce green and red light through fluorescence. The resulting mixture of red, green and blue is not only perceived by humans as white light but is superior for illumination in terms of [[color rendering]], whereas one cannot appreciate the color of red or green objects illuminated only by the yellow (and remaining blue) wavelengths from the YAG phosphor.\n\n[[File:Haitz law.svg|thumb|320px|Illustration of [[Haitz's law]], showing improvement in light output per LED over time, with a logarithmic scale on the vertical axis]]\nThe first white LEDs were expensive and inefficient. However, the light output of LEDs has increased [[exponential growth|exponentially]], with a doubling occurring approximately every 36 months since the 1960s (similar to [[Moore's law]]).

The same process is reversed here (i.e. the P-N junction emits light when electrical energy is applied to it). This phenomenon is generally called [[electroluminescence]], which can be defined as the emission of light from a [[semi-conductor]] under the influence of an [[electric field]]. The charge carriers recombine in a forward-biased P-N junction as the electrons cross from the N-region and recombine with the holes existing in the P-region. Free electrons are in the [[conduction band]] of energy levels, while holes are in the valence [[energy band]]. Thus the energy level of the holes will be lesser than the energy levels of the electrons. Some portion of the energy must be dissipated in order to recombine the electrons and the holes. This energy is emitted in the form of heat and light.\n\nThe electrons dissipate energy in the form of heat for silicon and germanium diodes but in [[gallium arsenide phosphide]] (GaAsP) and [[gallium phosphide]] (GaP) semiconductors, the electrons dissipate energy by emitting [[photon]]s. If the semiconductor is translucent, the junction becomes the source of light as it is emitted, thus becoming a light-emitting diode, but when the junction is reverse biased no light will be produced by the LED and, on the contrary, the device may also be damaged.\n\n==Technology==\n[[File:Diode-IV-Curve.svg|thumb|300px|I-V diagram for a [[diode]]. An LED will begin to emit light when more than 2 or 3 volts is applied to it. The reverse bias region uses a different vertical scale from the forward bias region, in order to show that the leakage current is nearly constant with voltage until breakdown occurs. In forward bias, the current is small but increases exponentially with voltage.]]\n\n===Physics===\nThe LED consists of a chip of semiconducting material [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] with impurities to create a ''[[p-n junction]]''. As in other diodes, current flows easily from the p-side, or [[anode]], to the n-side, or cathode, but not in the reverse direction. Charge-carriers\u2014[[electron]]s and [[electron hole|holes]]\u2014flow into the junction from [[electrode]]s with different voltages. When an electron meets a hole, it falls into a lower [[energy level]] and releases [[energy]] in the form of a [[photon]].\n\nThe [[wavelength]] of the light emitted, and thus its color, depends on the [[band gap]] energy of the materials forming the ''p-n junction''. In [[silicon]] or [[germanium]] diodes, the electrons and holes usually recombine by a ''non-radiative transition'', which produces no optical emission, because these are [[indirect band gap]] materials. The materials used for the LED have a [[direct band gap]] with energies corresponding to near-infrared, visible, or near-ultraviolet light.\n\nLED development began with infrared and red devices made with [[gallium arsenide]]. Advances in [[materials science]] have enabled making devices with ever-shorter wavelengths, emitting light in a variety of colors.\n\nLEDs are usually built on an n-type substrate, with an electrode attached to the p-type layer deposited on its surface. P-type substrates, while less common, occur as well. Many commercial LEDs, especially GaN/InGaN, also use [[sapphire]] substrate.\n\nMost materials used for LED production have very high [[refractive index|refractive indices]]. This means that much of the light will be reflected back into the material at the material/air surface interface. Thus, [[light extraction in LEDs]] is an important aspect of LED production, subject to much research and development.\n\n===Refractive index===\n[[File:LED-chip-20-deg-crti-angle - both types - crop.png|thumb|300px|Idealized example of light emission cones in a semiconductor, for a single point-source emission zone. The left illustration is for a fully translucent wafer, while the right illustration shows the half-cones formed when the bottom layer is fully opaque.

Every atom across this plane has an individual set of emission cones.\n\nDrawing the billions of overlapping cones is impossible, so this is a simplified diagram showing the extents of all the emission cones combined. The larger side cones are clipped to show the interior features and reduce image complexity; they would extend to the opposite edges of the two-dimensional emission plane.]]\n\nBare uncoated semiconductors such as [[silicon]] exhibit a very high [[refractive index]] relative to open air, which prevents passage of photons arriving at sharp angles relative to the air-contacting surface of the semiconductor due to [[total internal reflection]]. This property affects both the light-emission efficiency of LEDs as well as the light-absorption efficiency of [[photovoltaic cell]]s.

Around 1999, [[Philips Lumileds Lighting Company|Philips Lumileds]] introduced power LEDs capable of continuous use at one [[watt]]. These LEDs used much larger semiconductor die sizes to handle the large power inputs. Also, the semiconductor dies were mounted onto metal slugs to allow for heat removal from the LED die.\n\nOne of the key advantages of LED-based lighting sources is high [[luminous efficacy]]. White LEDs quickly matched and overtook the efficacy of standard incandescent lighting systems. In 2002, Lumileds made five-watt LEDs available with luminous efficacy of 18\u201322 lumens per watt (lm/W). For comparison, a conventional [[incandescent light bulb]] of 60\u2013100 watts emits around 15&nbsp;lm/W, and standard [[fluorescent light]]s emit up to 100&nbsp;lm/W.\n\n{{As of|2012}}, [[Philips]] had achieved the following efficacies for each color.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philipslumileds.com/uploads/221/PG01-pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314111003/http://www.philipslumileds.com/uploads/221/PG01-pdf |title=All in 1 LED Lighting Solutions Guide|website=PhilipsLumileds.com|publisher=[[Philips]]|page=15|date=2012-10-04|archivedate=March 14, 2013 |accessdate=2015-11-18|format=PDF}}</ref> The efficiency values show the physics \u2013 light power out per electrical power in.

Solving the problem of efficiency droop would mean that household LED light bulbs would need fewer LEDs, which would significantly reduce costs.\n\nResearchers at the [[U.S. Naval Research Laboratory]] have found a way to lessen the efficiency droop. They found that the droop arises from [[non-radiative recombination|non-radiative]] Auger recombination of the injected carriers. They created quantum wells with a soft confinement potential to lessen the non-radiative Auger processes.<ref>[http://www.nrl.navy.mil/media/news-releases/2014/a-roadmap-to-efficient-green-blue-ultraviolet-light-emitting-diodes A Roadmap to Efficient Green-Blue-Ultraviolet Light-Emitting Diodes], U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, 19 February 2014, Donna McKinney</ref>\n\nResearchers at [[Taiwan National Central University]] and [[Epistar Corp]] are developing a way to lessen the efficiency droop by using ceramic aluminium nitride (AlN) substrates, which are more [[Thermal conductivity|thermally conductive]] than the commercially used sapphire.

Sudden failures, although rare, can also occur. Early red LEDs were notable for their short service life. With the development of high-power LEDs the devices are subjected to higher [[junction temperature]]s and higher current densities than traditional devices. This causes stress on the material and may cause early light-output degradation. To quantitatively classify useful lifetime in a standardized manner it has been suggested to use L70 or L50, which are the runtimes (typically given in thousands of hours) at which a given LED reaches 70% and 50% of initial light output, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Narendran, N.  |author2=Y.

The manufacturer commonly specifies a maximum junction temperature of 125 or 150 \u00b0C, and lower temperatures are advisable in the interests of long life. At these temperatures, relatively little heat is lost by radiation, which means that the light beam generated by an LED is cool.\n\nThe waste heat in a high-power LED (which as of 2015 can be less than half the power that it consumes) is conveyed by conduction through the substrate and package of the LED to a [[heat sink]], which gives up the heat to the ambient air by convection. Careful thermal design is therefore essential, taking into account the [[thermal resistance|thermal resistances]] of the LED\u2019s package, the heat sink and the interface between the two. Medium-power LEDs are often designed to be soldered directly to a [[printed circuit board]] that contains a thermally conductive metal layer. High-power LEDs are packaged in large-area ceramic packages designed to be attached to a metal [[heat sink]], the interface being a material with high thermal conductivity ([[thermal grease]], [[phase-change material]], [[thermally conductive pad]] or [[thermal adhesive]]).\n\nIf an LED-based lamp is installed in an unventilated [[luminaire]], or a luminaire is located in an environment that does not have free air circulation, the LED is likely to overheat, resulting in reduced life or early catastrophic failure. Thermal design is often based on an [[ambient temperature]] of {{convert|25|C}}. LEDs used in outdoor applications, such as traffic signals or in-pavement signal lights, and in climates where the temperature within the light fixture gets very high, could experience reduced output or even failure.<ref name=\"RPI.edu\">Conway, K.

They have an active region consisting of one or more InGaN [[quantum well]]s sandwiched between thicker layers of GaN, called cladding layers. By varying the relative In/Ga fraction in the InGaN quantum wells, the light emission can in theory be varied from violet to amber. [[Aluminium gallium nitride]] (AlGaN) of varying Al/Ga fraction can be used to manufacture the cladding and quantum well layers for ultraviolet LEDs, but these devices have not yet reached the level of efficiency and technological maturity of InGaN/GaN blue/green devices. If un-alloyed GaN is used in this case to form the active quantum well layers, the device will emit near-ultraviolet light with a peak wavelength centred around 365&nbsp;nm. Green LEDs manufactured from the InGaN/GaN system are far more efficient and brighter than green LEDs produced with non-nitride material systems, but practical devices still exhibit efficiency too low for high-brightness applications.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nWith nitrides containing aluminium, most often [[Aluminium gallium nitride|AlGaN]] and [[aluminium gallium indium nitride|AlGaInN]], even shorter wavelengths are achievable. Ultraviolet LEDs in a range of wavelengths are becoming available on the market. Near-UV emitters at wavelengths around 375\u2013395&nbsp;nm are already cheap and often encountered, for example, as [[black light]] lamp replacements for inspection of anti-[[counterfeiting]] UV watermarks in some documents and paper currencies. Shorter-wavelength diodes, while substantially more expensive, are commercially available for wavelengths down to 240&nbsp;nm.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.semiconductor-today.com/features/SemiconductorToday%20-%20Going%20deep%20for%20UV%20sterilization%20LEDs.pdf |journal=Semiconductor Today |title=Going Deep for UV Sterilization LEDs |page=82 |volume=5 |issue=3 |author=Cooke, Mike |date=April\u2013May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515030549/http://www.semiconductor-today.com/features/SemiconductorToday%20-%20Going%20deep%20for%20UV%20sterilization%20LEDs.pdf |archivedate=May 15, 2013 }}</ref> As the photosensitivity of microorganisms approximately matches the absorption spectrum of [[DNA]], with a peak at about 260&nbsp;nm, UV LED emitting at 250\u2013270&nbsp;nm are to be expected in prospective disinfection and sterilization devices.

By independently [[pulse-width modulation|adjusting]] each of the three, RGB LEDs are capable of producing a wide [[color gamut]]. Unlike dedicated-color LEDs, however, these obviously do not produce pure wavelengths. Moreover, such modules as commercially available are often not optimized for smooth color mixing.\n\n===White===\nThere are two primary ways of producing [[Solar Light|white light]]-emitting diodes (WLEDs), LEDs that generate high-intensity white light. One is to use individual LEDs that emit three [[primary color]]s<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/1520-6378(2001)26:1+<::AID-COL47>3.0.CO;2-4 |year=2000 |title=The derivation of XYZ tristimulus spaces: A comparison of two alternative methods |author1=Wold, J.

The other is to use a phosphor material to convert monochromatic light from a blue or UV LED to broad-spectrum white light, much in the same way a fluorescent light bulb works. It is important to note that the 'whiteness' of the light produced is essentially engineered to suit the human eye, and depending on the situation it may not always be appropriate to think of it as white light.\n\nThere are three main methods of mixing colors to produce white light from an LED:\n* blue LED + green LED + red LED (color mixing; can be used as backlighting for displays)\n* near-UV or UV LED + RGB phosphor (an LED producing light with a wavelength shorter than blue's is used to excite an RGB phosphor)\n* blue LED + yellow phosphor (two complementary colors combine to form white light; more efficient than first two methods and more commonly used)<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/ecj.10394|year = 2012|title=Latest trends in LED lighting|author1=Bessho, M |author2=Shimizu, K |journal=Electronics and Communications in Japan|volume=95|issue=1|pages=1\u20137}}</ref>\n\nBecause of [[Metamerism (color)|metamerism]], it is possible to have quite different spectra that appear white. However, the appearance of objects illuminated by that light may vary as the spectrum varies.\n\n====RGB systems====\n\n[[File:Red-YellowGreen-Blue LED spectra.png|thumb|380px|Combined spectral curves for blue, yellow-green, and high-brightness red solid-state semiconductor LEDs. [[Full width at half maximum|FWHM]] spectral bandwidth is approximately 24\u201327 nm for all three colors.]]\n\n[[File:RGB LED.jpg|thumb|RGB LED]]\n\nWhite light can be formed by mixing differently colored lights; the most common method is to use red, green, and blue (RGB). Hence the method is called multi-color white LEDs (sometimes referred to as RGB LEDs). Because these need electronic circuits to control the blending and [[diffusion]] of different colors, and because the individual color LEDs typically have slightly different emission patterns (leading to variation of the color depending on direction) even if they are made as a single unit, these are seldom used to produce white lighting. Nonetheless, this method has many applications because of the flexibility of mixing different colors,<ref>{{Cite journal \n| doi = 10.1364/OE.15.003607 \n| last1 = Moreno | first1 = I. \n| last2 = Contreras | first2 = U. \n| title = Color distribution from multicolor LED arrays \n| journal = Optics Express \n| volume = 15 \n| issue = 6 \n| pages = 3607\u20133618 \n| year = 2007 \n| pmid = 19532605\n}}</ref> and in principle, this mechanism also has higher quantum efficiency in producing white light.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nThere are several types of multi-color white LEDs: [[:wiktionary:dichromatic|di-]], [[trichromatic|tri-]], and [[tetrachromatic]] white LEDs. Several key factors that play among these different methods, include color stability, [[color rendering index|color rendering]] capability, and luminous efficacy. Often, higher efficiency will mean lower color rendering, presenting a trade-off between the luminous efficacy and color rendering. For example, the dichromatic white LEDs have the best luminous efficacy (120 lm/W), but the lowest color rendering capability. However, although tetrachromatic white LEDs have excellent color rendering capability, they often have poor luminous efficacy. Trichromatic white LEDs are in between, having both good luminous efficacy (>70 lm/W) and fair color rendering capability.\n\nOne of the challenges is the development of more efficient green LEDs. The theoretical maximum for green LEDs is 683 lumens per watt but as of 2010 few green LEDs exceed even 100 lumens per watt. The blue and red LEDs get closer to their theoretical limits.\n\nMulti-color LEDs offer not merely another means to form white light but a new means to form light of different colors. Most [[color#Perception|perceivable colors]] can be formed by mixing different amounts of three primary colors. This allows precise dynamic color control. As more effort is devoted to investigating this method, multi-color LEDs should have profound influence on the fundamental method that we use to produce and control light color. However, before this type of LED can play a role on the market, several technical problems must be solved. These include that this type of LED's emission power [[exponential decay|decays exponentially]] with rising temperature,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Schubert |first1=E.

Such problems inhibit and may preclude industrial use. Thus, many new package designs aimed at solving this problem have been proposed and their results are now being reproduced by researchers and scientists.\n\n[[Correlated color temperature]] (CCT) dimming for LED technology is regarded as a difficult task, since binning, age and temperature drift effects of LEDs change the actual color value output. Feedback loop systems are used for example with color sensors, to actively monitor and control the color output of multiple color mixing LEDs.<ref>{{cite book\n | title = Sensors and Feedback Control of Multi-Color LED Systems\n | format = PDF\n | first1 = Thomas | last1 = Nimz\n | first2 = Fredrik | last2 = Hailer\n | first3 = Kevin | last3 = Jensen\n | publisher = LED Professional\n | date = November 2012\n | issue = 34\n | issn = 1993-890X\n | pages = 2\u20135\n | url = http://www.mazet.de/en/english-documents/english/featured-articles/sensors-and-feedback-control-of-multi-color-led-systems-1/download#.UX7VXYIcUZI\n }}</ref>\n\n====Phosphor-based LEDs====\n[[File:White LED.png|thumb|right|350px|Spectrum of a white LED showing blue light directly emitted by the GaN-based LED (peak at about 465 nm) and the more broadband [[Stokes shift|Stokes-shifted]] light emitted by the Ce<sup>3+</sup>:YAG phosphor, which emits at roughly 500\u2013700 nm]]\n\nThis method involves [[coating]] LEDs of one color (mostly blue LEDs made of [[InGaN]]) with [[phosphor]]s of different colors to form white light; the resultant LEDs are called phosphor-based or phosphor-converted white LEDs (pcLEDs).<ref>{{cite journal\n|title=YAG glass-ceramic phosphor for white LED (II): luminescence characteristics\n|author1=Tanabe, S. |author2=Fujita, S. |author3=Yoshihara, S. |author4=Sakamoto, A. |author5=Yamamoto, S.\n|journal=Proc.

Their luminous efficacies compared to normal LEDs depend on the spectral distribution of the resultant light output and the original wavelength of the LED itself. For example, the luminous efficacy of a typical YAG yellow phosphor based white LED ranges from 3 to 5 times the luminous efficacy of the original blue LED because of the human eye's greater sensitivity to yellow than to blue (as modeled in the [[luminosity function]]). Due to the simplicity of manufacturing the phosphor method is still the most popular method for making high-intensity white LEDs. The design and production of a light source or light fixture using a monochrome emitter with phosphor conversion is simpler and cheaper than a complex [[#RGB systems|RGB]] system, and the majority of high-intensity white LEDs presently on the market are manufactured using phosphor light conversion.\n\nAmong the challenges being faced to improve the efficiency of LED-based white light sources is the development of more efficient phosphors. As of 2010, the most efficient yellow phosphor is still the YAG phosphor, with less than 10% Stoke shift loss. Losses attributable to internal optical losses due to re-absorption in the LED chip and in the LED packaging itself account typically for another 10% to 30% of efficiency loss. Currently, in the area of phosphor LED development, much effort is being spent on optimizing these devices to higher light output and higher operation temperatures. For instance, the efficiency can be raised by adapting better package design or by using a more suitable type of phosphor. Conformal coating process is frequently used to address the issue of varying phosphor thickness.\n\nSome phosphor-based white LEDs encapsulate InGaN blue LEDs inside phosphor-coated epoxy. Alternatively, the LED might be paired with a remote phosphor, a preformed polycarbonate piece coated with the phosphor material. Remote phosphors provide more diffuse light, which is desirable for many applications. Remote phosphor designs are also more tolerant of variations in the LED emissions spectrum. A common yellow phosphor material is [[cerium]]-[[Doping (Semiconductors)|doped]] [[yttrium aluminium garnet]] (Ce<sup>3+</sup>:YAG).\n\nWhite LEDs can also be made by [[coating]] near-[[ultraviolet]] (NUV) LEDs with a mixture of high-efficiency [[europium]]-based phosphors that emit red and blue, plus copper and aluminium-doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu, Al) that emits green. This is a method analogous to the way [[fluorescent lamp]]s work. This method is less efficient than blue LEDs with YAG:Ce phosphor, as the [[Stokes shift]] is larger, so more energy is converted to heat, but yields light with better spectral characteristics, which render color better. Due to the higher radiative output of the ultraviolet LEDs than of the blue ones, both methods offer comparable brightness. A concern is that UV light may leak from a malfunctioning light source and cause harm to human eyes or skin.\n\n====Other white LEDs====\nAnother method used to produce experimental white light LEDs used no phosphors at all and was based on [[epitaxy|homoepitaxially]] grown [[zinc selenide]] (ZnSe) on a ZnSe substrate that simultaneously emitted blue light from its active region and yellow light from the substrate.<ref>{{cite web| title = Joint venture to make ZnSe white LEDs\n| date = December 6, 2002\n| author = Whitaker, Tim\n| url = http://optics.org/cws/article/research/16534\n| accessdate = January 3, 2009\n}}</ref>\n\nA new style of wafers composed of gallium-nitride-on-silicon (GaN-on-Si) is being used to produce white LEDs using 200-mm silicon wafers.

A layer of quantum dots is sandwiched between layers of electron-transporting and hole-transporting materials. An applied electric field causes electrons and holes to move into the quantum dot layer and recombine forming an [[exciton]] that excites a QD.

The low-power dissipation of these LEDs affords them more flexibility than the original AC LED design.<ref name=\"IDA\" />\n\n===Application-specific variations===\n\n====Flashing====\nFlashing LEDs are used as attention seeking indicators without requiring external electronics. Flashing LEDs resemble standard LEDs but they contain an integrated [[multivibrator]] circuit that causes the LED to flash with a typical period of one second. In diffused lens LEDs, this circuit is visible as a small black dot. Most flashing LEDs emit light of one color, but more sophisticated devices can flash between multiple colors and even fade through a color sequence using RGB color mixing.\n\n====Bi-color====\nBi-color LEDs contain two different LED emitters in one case. There are two types of these. One type consists of two dies connected to the same two leads [[Antiparallel (electronics)|antiparallel]] to each other. Current flow in one direction emits one color, and current in the opposite direction emits the other color. The other type consists of two dies with separate leads for both dies and another lead for common anode or cathode, so that they can be controlled independently.\n\n====Tri-color====\nTri-color LEDs contain three different LED emitters in one case. Each emitter is connected to a separate lead so they can be controlled independently. A four-lead arrangement is typical with one common lead (anode or cathode) and an additional lead for each color.\n\n====RGB====\nRGB LEDs are tri-color LEDs with red, green, and blue emitters, in general using a four-wire connection with one common lead (anode or cathode). These LEDs can have either common positive or common negative leads. Others however, have only two leads (positive and negative) and have a built-in tiny [[electronic control unit]].\n\n====Decorative-multicolor====\nDecorative-multicolor LEDs incorporate several emitters of different colors supplied by only two lead-out wires. Colors are switched internally by varying the supply voltage.\n\n====Alphanumeric====\nAlphanumeric LEDs are available in [[seven-segment display|seven-segment]], [[Starburst display|starburst]] and [[Dot-matrix display|dot-matrix]] format. Seven-segment displays handle all numbers and a limited set of letters. Starburst displays can display all letters. Dot-matrix displays typically use 5x7 pixels per character. Seven-segment LED displays were in widespread use in the 1970s and 1980s, but rising use of [[liquid crystal display]]s, with their lower power needs and greater display flexibility, has reduced the popularity of numeric and alphanumeric LED displays.\n\n====Digital-RGB====\nDigital-RGB LEDs are RGB LEDs that contain their own \"smart\" control electronics. In addition to power and ground, these provide connections for data-in, data-out, and sometimes a clock or strobe signal. These are connected in a [[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]], with the data in of the first LED sourced by a microprocessor, which can control the brightness and color of each LED independently of the others. They are used where a combination of maximum control and minimum visible electronics are needed such as strings for Christmas and LED matrices. Some even have refresh rates in the kHz range, allowing for basic video applications.\n\n====Filament====\nAn [[LED filament]] consists of multiple LED chips connected in series on a common longitudinal substrate that form a thin rod reminiscent of a traditional incandescent filament.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.ledinside.com/knowledge/2015/2/the_next_generation_of_led_filament_bulbs\n|title=The Next Generation of LED Filament Bulbs\n|website=LEDInside.com|publisher=Trendforce\n|accessdate=October 26, 2015}}\n</ref> These are being used as a low cost decorative alternative for traditional light bulbs that are being phased out in many countries. The filaments require a rather high voltage to light to nominal brightness, allowing them to work efficiently and simply with mains voltages. Often a simple rectifier and capacitive current limiting are employed to create a low-cost replacement for a traditional light bulb without the complexity of creating a low voltage, high current converter which is required by single die LEDs.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_XiunR-cAQ\n|title=LED Filaments\n|accessdate=October 26, 2015}}\n</ref> Usually they are packaged in a sealed enclosure with a shape similar to lamps they were designed to replace (e.g. a bulb), and filled with inert nitrogen or carbon dioxide gas to remove heat efficiently.\n\n==Considerations for use==\n\n===Power sources===\n{{Main article|LED power sources}}\n[[File:LED circuit.svg|thumb|upright|Simple LED circuit with resistor for current limiting]]\n\nThe current\u2013voltage characteristic of an LED is similar to other diodes, in that the current is dependent exponentially on the voltage (see [[Shockley diode equation]]). This means that a small change in voltage can cause a large change in current.<ref>{{cite book|title=Elektrotechnik Gesamtband Technische Mathematik Kommunikationselektronik|date=1997|publisher=Westermann|isbn=3142212515|page=171|edition=1st|language=de}}</ref> If the applied voltage exceeds the LED's forward voltage drop by a small amount, the current rating may be exceeded by a large amount, potentially damaging or destroying the LED. The typical solution is to use [[Constant current|constant-current]] power supplies to keep the current below the LED's maximum current rating. Since most common power sources (batteries, mains) are constant-voltage sources, most LED fixtures must include a power converter, at least a current-limiting resistor.\nHowever, the high resistance of three-volt [[Button cell|coin cells]] combined with the high differential resistance of nitride-based LEDs makes it possible to power such an LED from such a coin cell without an external resistor.\n\n===Electrical polarity===\n{{Main article|Electrical polarity of LEDs}}\n\nAs with all diodes, current flows easily from p-type to n-type material.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Schubert, E. Fred |title=Light-Emitting Diodes|publisher= Cambridge University Press|year= 2005|chapter =Chapter 4|isbn=0-8194-3956-8}}</ref>\nHowever, no current flows and no light is emitted if a small voltage is applied in the reverse direction. If the reverse voltage grows large enough to exceed the [[breakdown voltage]], a large current flows and the LED may be damaged. If the reverse current is sufficiently limited to avoid damage, the reverse-conducting LED is a useful [[Hardware random number generator#Physical phenomena without quantum-random properties|noise diode]].\n\n===Safety and health===\nThe vast majority of devices containing LEDs are \"safe under all conditions of normal use\", and so are classified as \"Class 1 LED product\"/\"LED Klasse 1\".

Wasted energy is dispersed as heat through the base of the LED.\n* '''Slow failure:''' LEDs mostly fail by dimming over time, rather than the abrupt failure of incandescent bulbs.<ref name=eere/>\n* '''Lifetime:''' LEDs can have a relatively long useful life. One report estimates 35,000 to 50,000 hours of useful life, though time to complete failure may be longer.<ref>[http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/publications/pdfs/ssl/lifetime_white_leds_aug16_r1.pdf Lifetime of White LEDs].

Several [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] demonstrations have shown that reduced maintenance costs from this extended lifetime, rather than energy savings, is the primary factor in determining the payback period for an LED product.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://energy.ltgovernors.com/in-depth-advantages-of-led-lighting.html|title=In depth: Advantages of LED Lighting|work=energy.ltgovernors.com}}</ref>\n* '''Shock resistance:''' LEDs, being solid-state components, are difficult to damage with external shock, unlike fluorescent and incandescent bulbs, which are fragile.\n* '''Focus:''' The solid package of the LED can be designed to [[focus (optics)|focus]] its light. Incandescent and fluorescent sources often require an external reflector to collect light and direct it in a usable manner. For larger LED packages [[total internal reflection]] (TIR) lenses are often used to the same effect. However, when large quantities of light are needed many light sources are usually deployed, which are difficult to focus or [[collimate]] towards the same target.\n\n===Disadvantages===\n* '''Initial price:''' LEDs are currently slightly more expensive (price per lumen) on an initial capital cost basis, than other lighting technologies. {{As of|2014|3}}, at least one manufacturer claims to have reached $1 per kilolumen.<ref>http://www.philipslumileds.com/uploads/news/id228/PR211.pdf</ref> The additional expense partially stems from the relatively low lumen output and the drive circuitry and power supplies needed.\n* '''Temperature dependence:''' LED performance largely depends on the ambient temperature of the operating environment&nbsp;\u2013 or thermal management properties. Overdriving an LED in high ambient temperatures may result in overheating the LED package, eventually leading to device failure. An adequate [[heat sink]] is needed to maintain long life. This is especially important in automotive, medical, and military uses where devices must operate over a wide range of temperatures, which require low failure rates. Toshiba has produced LEDs with an operating temperature range of \u221240 to 100&nbsp;\u00b0C, which suits the LEDs for both indoor and outdoor use in applications such as lamps, ceiling lighting, street lights, and floodlights.<ref name=\"electronicdesign.com\" />\n* '''Voltage sensitivity:''' LEDs must be supplied with a voltage above their [[P\u2013n junction#Forward bias|threshold voltage]] and a current below their rating. Current and lifetime change greatly with a small change in applied voltage. They thus require a current-regulated supply (usually just a series resistor for indicator LEDs).<ref>[http://www.ledmuseum.org/ The Led Museum]. The Led Museum.

So LEDs are difficult to apply to uses needing a spherical light field; however, different fields of light can be manipulated by the application of different optics or \"lenses\". LEDs cannot provide divergence below a few degrees. In contrast, lasers can emit beams with divergences of 0.2 degrees or less.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Hecht, E. |title=Optics|edition=4|page=591|publisher=Addison Wesley|year= 2002|isbn=0-19-510818-3}}</ref>\n* '''[[Electrical polarity]]:''' Unlike [[incandescent]] light bulbs, which illuminate regardless of the [[electrical polarity]], LEDs will only light with correct electrical polarity.

Large-area [[LED display]]s are used as stadium displays, dynamic decorative displays, and [[dynamic message sign]]s on freeways. Thin, lightweight message displays are used at airports and railway stations, and as [[Destination sign|destination displays]] for trains, buses, trams, and ferries.\n\n[[File:Red and green traffic signals, Stamford Road, Singapore - 20111210.jpg|thumb|upright|Red and green LED traffic signals]]\n\nOne-color light is well suited for [[traffic light]]s and signals, [[exit sign]]s, [[emergency vehicle lighting]], ships' navigation lights or [[lantern]]s (chromacity and luminance standards being set under the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972, Annex I and the CIE) and [[Christmas lighting technology#LEDs|LED-based Christmas lights]]. In cold climates, LED traffic lights may remain snow-covered.<ref>[http://www.ledsmagazine.com/news/7/1/4 LED advantages outweigh potential snow hazards in traffic signals], LEDs magazine January 7, 2010</ref> Red or yellow LEDs are used in indicator and alphanumeric displays in environments where night vision must be retained: aircraft cockpits, submarine and ship bridges, astronomy observatories, and in the field, e.g. night time animal watching and military field use.\n\n[[File:LEDClose6545.jpg|thumb|Automotive applications for LEDs continue to grow.]]\n\nBecause of their long life, fast switching times, and their ability to be seen in broad daylight due to their high output and focus, LEDs have been used in brake lights for cars' [[center high-mounted stop lamp|high-mounted brake lights]], trucks, and buses, and in turn signals for some time, but many vehicles now use LEDs for their rear light clusters. The use in brakes improves safety, due to a great reduction in the time needed to light fully, or faster rise time, up to 0.5 second faster{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} than an incandescent bulb. This gives drivers behind more time to react. In a dual intensity circuit (rear markers and brakes) if the LEDs are not pulsed at a fast enough frequency, they can create a [[flicker fusion threshold#Visual phenomena|phantom array]], where ghost images of the LED will appear if the eyes quickly scan across the array. White LED headlamps are starting to be used. Using LEDs has styling advantages because LEDs can form much thinner lights than incandescent lamps with [[parabolic reflector]]s.\n\nDue to the relative cheapness of low output LEDs, they are also used in many temporary uses such as [[glowstick]]s, [[throwies]], and the photonic [[textile]] [[Lumalive]]. Artists have also used LEDs for [[LED art]].\n\n[[Weather radio|Weather]] and [[NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards|all-hazards]] radio receivers with [[Specific Area Message Encoding]] (SAME) have three LEDs: red for warnings, orange for watches, and yellow for advisories and statements whenever issued.\n\n===Lighting===\nWith the development of high-efficiency and high-power LEDs, it has become possible to use LEDs in lighting and illumination. To encourage the shift to [[LED lamp]]s and other high-efficiency lighting, the [[US Department of Energy]] has created the [[L Prize]] competition. The [[Philips]] Lighting North America LED bulb won the first competition on August 3, 2011 after successfully completing 18 months of intensive field, lab, and product testing.<ref>[http://www.lightingprize.org/ \"L-Prize U.S. Department of Energy\"], L-Prize Website, August 3, 2011</ref>\n\nLEDs are used as [[street light]]s and in other [[Architectural lighting design|architectural lighting]]. The mechanical robustness and long lifetime is used in [[automotive lighting]] on cars, motorcycles, and [[Bicycle lighting#LEDs|bicycle lights]]. LED light emission may be efficiently controlled by using [[nonimaging optics]] principles.\n\n[[LED street light]]s are employed on poles and in parking garages. In 2007, the Italian village of [[Torraca]] was the first place to convert its entire illumination system to LEDs.<ref>[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=led-there-be-light LED There Be Light], Scientific American, March 18, 2009</ref>\n\nLEDs are used in aviation lighting. [[Airbus]] has used LED lighting in its [[Airbus A320 Enhanced]] since 2007, and Boeing uses LED lighting in the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787]]. LEDs are also being used now in airport and heliport lighting. LED airport fixtures currently include medium-intensity runway lights, runway centerline lights, taxiway centerline and edge lights, guidance signs, and obstruction lighting.\n\nLEDs are also used as a light source for [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]] projectors, and to [[backlight]] [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] televisions (referred to as [[LED-backlit LCD display|LED TVs]]) and [[laptop]] displays. RGB LEDs raise the color gamut by as much as 45%.

In energy conservation, the lower heat output of LEDs also means air conditioning (cooling) systems have less heat in need of disposal.\n\nLEDs are small, durable and need little power, so they are used in handheld devices such as [[flashlight]]s. LED [[strobe light]]s or [[camera flash]]es operate at a safe, low voltage, instead of the 250+ volts commonly found in [[xenon]] flashlamp-based lighting. This is especially useful in cameras on [[mobile phone]]s, where space is at a premium and bulky voltage-raising circuitry is undesirable.\n\nLEDs are used for infrared illumination in [[night vision]] uses including [[security camera]]s.

A typical 13-watt LED lamp emitted 450 to 650 lumens,<ref name=\"doe2009\">{{Cite book| title=DOE Solid-State Lighting CALiPER Program Summary of Results: Round 7 of Product Testing| publisher=U.S. Department of Energy| date=February 2009| url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/publications/pdfs/ssl/caliper_round_7_summary_final.pdf| format=PDF}}</ref> which is equivalent to a standard 40-watt incandescent bulb.\n\nHowever, as of 2011, there are LED bulbs available as efficient as 150&nbsp;lm/W and even inexpensive low-end models typically exceed 50&nbsp;lm/W, so that a 6-watt LED could achieve the same results as a standard 40-watt incandescent bulb. The latter has an expected lifespan of 1,000 hours, whereas an LED can continue to operate with reduced efficiency for more than 50,000 hours.\n\nSee the chart below for a comparison of common light types:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!LED\n![[Compact fluorescent lamp|CFL]]\n![[Incandescent light bulb|Incandescent]]\n|-\n|Lightbulb Projected Lifespan\n|50,000 hours\n|10,000 hours\n|1,200 hours\n|-\n|[[Watt]]s Per Bulb (equiv. 60 watts)\n|10\n|14\n|60\n|-\n|Cost Per Bulb\n|Approx. $19.00\n|$7.00\n|$1.25\n|-\n|[[Kilowatt hour|KWh]] of Electricity Used Over 50,000 Hours\n|500\n|700\n|3000\n|-\n|Cost of Electricity (@ 0.10 per KWh)\n|$50\n|$70\n|$300\n|-\n|Bulbs Needed for 50,000 Hours of Use\n|1\n|5\n|42\n|-\n|Equivalent 50,000 Hours Bulb Expense\n|$19.00\n|$35.00\n|$52.50\n|-\n|TOTAL Cost for 50,000 Hours\n|$69.00\n|$105.00\n|$352.50\n|}\n\n====Energy consumption====\nIn the US, one kilowatt-hour (3.6 MJ) of electricity currently causes an average {{convert|1.34|lb|g}} of {{chem|CO|2}} emission.<ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/emission_factors.html US DOE EIA: Electricity Emission Factors].

A building\u2019s carbon footprint from lighting can therefore be reduced by 85% by exchanging all incandescent bulbs for new LEDs if a building previously used only incandescent bulbs.\n\nIn practice, most buildings that use a lot of lighting use [[fluorescent lighting]], which has 22% [[luminous efficiency]] compared with 5% for filaments, so changing to LED lighting would still give a 34% reduction in electrical power use and carbon emissions.\n\nThe reduction in carbon emissions depends on the source of electricity. [[Nuclear power in the United States]] produced 19.2% of electricity in 2011, so reducing electricity consumption in the U.S. reduces carbon emissions more than in France ([[Nuclear power in France|75% nuclear electricity]]) or Norway ([[Energy in Norway#Electricity generation|almost entirely hydroelectric]]).\n\nReplacing lights that spend the most time lit results in the most savings, so LED lights in infrequently used locations bring a smaller return on investment.\n\n===Light sources for machine vision systems===\n[[Machine vision]] systems often require bright and homogeneous illumination, so features of interest are easier to process.\nLEDs are often used for this purpose, and this is likely to remain one of their major uses until the price drops low enough to make signaling and illumination uses more widespread. [[Barcode scanner]]s are the most common example of machine vision, and many low cost products use red LEDs instead of lasers.<ref name=\"Administrator\">{{Cite web|title = Application of LED Lighting|url = http://www.abengroup.com/index.php/general-info/49-application-of-led-lighting|website = www.abengroup.com|access-date = 2016-02-12|last = Administrator}}</ref> Optical computer mice are an example of LEDs in machine vision, as it is used to provide an even light source on the surface for the miniature camera within the mouse. LEDs constitute a nearly ideal light source for [[machine vision]] systems for several reasons:\n* The size of the illuminated field is usually comparatively small and machine vision systems are often quite expensive, so the cost of the light source is usually a minor concern. However, it might not be easy to replace a broken light source placed within complex machinery, and here the long service life of LEDs is a benefit.\n* LED elements tend to be small and can be placed with high density over flat or even-shaped substrates (PCBs etc.) so that bright and homogeneous sources that direct light from tightly controlled directions on inspected parts can be designed. This can often be obtained with small, low-cost lenses and diffusers, helping to achieve high light densities with control over lighting levels and homogeneity. LED sources can be shaped in several configurations (spot lights for reflective illumination; ring lights for coaxial illumination; back lights for contour illumination; linear assemblies; flat, large format panels; dome sources for diffused, omnidirectional illumination).\n* LEDs can be easily strobed (in the microsecond range and below) and synchronized with imaging. High-power LEDs are available allowing well-lit images even with very short light pulses. This is often used to obtain crisp and sharp \"still\" images of quickly moving parts.\n* LEDs come in several different colors and wavelengths, allowing easy use of the best color for each need, where different color may provide better visibility of features of interest. Having a precisely known spectrum allows tightly matched filters to be used to separate informative bandwidth or to reduce disturbing effects of ambient light. LEDs usually operate at comparatively low working temperatures, simplifying heat management and dissipation. This allows using plastic lenses, filters, and diffusers. Waterproof units can also easily be designed, allowing use in harsh or wet environments (food, beverage, oil industries).<ref name=\"Administrator\"/>\n\n{{Gallery\n| File:LED screen behind Tsach Zimroni in Tel Aviv Israel.jpg | A large LED display behind a [[disc jockey]]\n| File:LED Digital Display.jpg | LED digital display that can display four digits and points\n| File:LED traffic light on red.jpg | [[Traffic light]] using LED\n| File:LED DaytimeRunningLights.jpg | LED [[daytime running light]]s of [[Audi A4]]\n| File:LED panel and plants.jpg | LED panel light source used in an experiment on [[plant]] growth.

This includes [[remote control]]s, such as for TVs, VCRs, and LED Computers, where infrared LEDs are often used. [[Opto-isolator]]s use an LED combined with a [[photodiode]] or [[phototransistor]] to provide a signal path with electrical isolation between two circuits. This is especially useful in medical equipment where the signals from a low-voltage [[sensor]] circuit (usually battery-powered) in contact with a living organism must be electrically isolated from any possible electrical failure in a recording or monitoring device operating at potentially dangerous voltages. An optoisolator also allows information to be transferred between circuits not sharing a common ground potential.\n\nMany sensor systems rely on light as the signal source. LEDs are often ideal as a light source due to the requirements of the sensors. LEDs are used as [[motion sensors]], for example in [[optical mouse|optical computer mice]]. The Nintendo [[Wii]]'s sensor bar uses infrared LEDs. [[Pulse oximeter]]s use them for measuring [[oxygen saturation]]. Some flatbed scanners use arrays of RGB LEDs rather than the typical [[cold-cathode fluorescent lamp]] as the light source. Having independent control of three illuminated colors allows the scanner to calibrate itself for more accurate color balance, and there is no need for warm-up. Further, its sensors only need be monochromatic, since at any one time the page being scanned is only lit by one color of light. Since LEDs can also be used as photodiodes, they can be used for both photo emission and detection. This could be used, for example, in a [[touchscreen]] that registers reflected light from a finger or [[stylus]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Dietz, P. H. |author2=Yerazunis, W. S. |author3=Leigh, D.

The forward voltage drop (e.g. about 1.7&nbsp;V for a normal red LED) can be used instead of a [[Zener diode]] in low-voltage regulators. Red LEDs have the flattest I/V curve above the knee. Nitride-based LEDs have a fairly steep I/V curve and are useless for this purpose. Although LED forward voltage is far more current-dependent than a Zener diode, Zener diodes with breakdown voltages below 3&nbsp;V are not widely available.\n[[File:Digitally printed LED wallpaper Dolomites.jpg |thumb|LED wallpaper by Meystyle]]\nThe progressive miniaturization of low-voltage lighting technology, such as [[LEDs]] and [[OLEDs]], suitable to be incorporated into low-thickness materials has fostered in recent years the experimentation on combining light sources and wall covering surfaces to be applied onto interior walls.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schubert |first=E.
