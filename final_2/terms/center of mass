The distribution of mass is balanced around the center of mass and the average of the weighted position coordinates of the distributed mass defines its coordinates.  Calculations in [[mechanics]] are often simplified when formulated with respect to the center of mass.\nIt is a hypothetical point where entire mass of an object may be assumed to be concentrated to visualise its motion.\nIn other words, center of mass is particle equivalent of a given object for application of Newtons laws of motion.\n\n''In the case of a single'' [[rigid body]], the center of mass is fixed in relation to the body, and if the body has uniform density, it will be located at the [[centroid]].  The center of mass may be located outside the physical body, as is sometimes the case for [[wikt:hollow|hollow]] or open-shaped objects, such as a [[horseshoe]].  In the case of a distribution of separate bodies, such as the [[planets]] of the [[Solar System]], the center of mass may not correspond to the position of any individual member of the system.\n\nThe center of mass is a useful reference point for calculations in [[mechanics]] that involve masses distributed in space, such as the [[momentum|linear]] and [[angular momentum]] of planetary bodies and [[rigid body dynamics]]. In [[orbital mechanics]], the equations of motion of planets are formulated as [[point mass]]es located at the centers of mass.  The [[center of mass frame]] is an [[inertial frame]] in which the center of mass of a system is at rest with respect to the origin of the coordinate system.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of \"center of mass\" in the form of the '''center of gravity''' was first introduced by the ancient Greek physicist, mathematician, and engineer [[Archimedes|Archimedes of Syracuse]]. He worked with simplified assumptions about gravity that amount to a uniform field, thus arriving at the mathematical properties of what we now call the center of mass. Archimedes showed that the [[torque]] exerted on a [[lever]] by weights resting at various points along the lever is the same as what it would be if all of the weights were moved to a single point\u2014their center of mass. In work on floating bodies he demonstrated that the orientation of a floating object is the one that makes its center of mass as low as possible. He developed mathematical techniques for finding the centers of mass of objects of uniform density of various well-defined shapes.{{sfn|Shore|2008|pp=9\u201311}}\n\nLater mathematicians who developed the theory of the center of mass include [[Pappus of Alexandria]], [[Guido Ubaldi]], [[Francesco Maurolico]],{{sfn|Baron|2004|pp=91\u201394}} [[Federico Commandino]],{{sfn|Baron|2004|pp=94\u201396}} [[Simon Stevin]],{{sfn|Baron|2004|pp=96\u2013101}} [[Luca Valerio]],{{sfn|Baron|2004|pp=101\u2013106}} [[Jean-Charles de la Faille]], [[Paul Guldin]],{{sfn|Mancosu|1999|pp=56\u201361}} [[John Wallis]], [[Louis Carr\u00e9 (mathematician)|Louis Carr\u00e9]], [[Pierre Varignon]], and [[Alexis Clairaut]].{{sfn|Walton|1855|p=2}}\n\n[[Newton's second law]] is reformulated with respect to the center of mass in [[Euler's laws#Euler's first law|Euler's first law]].{{sfn|Beatty|2006|p=29}}\n[[File:CoG stable.svg|thumb|Diagram of an educational toy that balances on a point: the center of mass (C) settles below its support (P)]]\n<!---Please put this section back if you can revise it\n==Center of gravity==\nThe term \"center of mass\" is often used interchangeably with the term '''center of gravity''' because any uniform [[Newton's law of universal gravitation#Gravitational field|gravitational field]] '''g''' acts on a system as if the mass ''M'' of the system were concentrated at the center of mass '''R'''. The center of gravity is defined as the average position of weight distribution, and mass and weight are technically different properties. However, because weight and mass are proportional, the center of gravity and center of mass refer to the same point of an object for almost all objects on and near Earth's surface. Generally, physicists prefer to use the term ''center of mass'', as an object has a center of mass whether or not it is under the influence of gravity. In addition, the term \"center of gravity\" refers to the single point associated with an object where the force of [[Gravitation|gravity]] can be considered to act,\n\nSpecifically, the [[gravitational potential energy]] is equal to the potential energy of a point mass ''M'' at '''R''',{{sfn|Goldstein|Poole|Safko|2001|p=185}} and the gravitational [[torque]] is equal to the torque of a force ''M'''''g''' acting at '''R'''.{{sfn|Feynman|Leighton|Sands|1963|p=19.3}} In a uniform gravitational field, the center of mass is a center of gravity, and in common usage, the two phrases are used as synonyms.\n\nIn a non-uniform field, gravitational effects such as [[potential energy]], [[force]], and [[torque]] can no longer be calculated using the center of mass alone. In particular, a non-uniform gravitational field can produce a torque on an object, causing it to rotate. The center of gravity, an application point of the [[resultant force|resultant]] gravitational force, may not exist or not be unique; see [[centers of gravity in non-uniform fields]].\n-->\n\n=={{anchor|Definition of center of mass}}Definition==\nThe center of mass is the unique point at the center of a distribution of mass in space that has the property that the weighted position vectors relative to this point sum to zero. In analogy to statistics, the center of mass is the mean location of a distribution of mass in space.\n\n===A system of particles===\nIn the case of a system of particles {{math|1=''P<sub>i</sub>'', ''i'' = 1,\u2009\u2026,\u2009''n''\u2009}}, each with mass {{mvar|m<sub>i</sub>}} that are located in space with coordinates {{math|1='''r'''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''i'' = 1,\u2009\u2026,\u2009''n''\u2009}}, the coordinates '''R''' of the center of mass satisfy the condition\n:<math> \\sum_{i=1}^n m_i(\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{R}) = 0.</math>\nSolving this equation for '''R''' yields the formula\n:<math>\\mathbf{R} = \\frac 1M \\sum_{i=1}^n m_i \\mathbf{r}_i,</math>\nwhere {{mvar|M}} is the sum of the masses of all of the particles.\n\n===A continuous volume===\nIf the mass distribution is continuous with the density \u03c1('''r''') within a solid ''Q'', then the integral of the weighted position coordinates of the points in this volume relative to the center of mass '''R''' over the volume '''V''' is zero, that is\n:<math>\\iiint\\limits_{Q} \\rho(\\mathbf{r})(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{R})dV = 0.</math>\nSolve this equation for the coordinates '''R''' to obtain\n:<math>\\mathbf R = \\frac 1M \\iiint\\limits_{Q}\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\mathbf{r} dV,</math>\nwhere M is the total mass in the volume.\n\nIf a continuous mass distribution has uniform [[density]], which means \u03c1 is constant, then the center of mass is the same as the [[centroid]] of the volume.{{sfn|Levi|2009|p=85}} The center of mass is ''not'' generally the point at which a plane separates the distribution of mass into two equal halves.{{dubious|date=September 2016}}{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} In analogy with statistics, the median is not the same as the mean.\n\n===Barycentric coordinates===\n{{further|Barycentric coordinate system}}\nThe coordinates '''R''' of the center of mass of a two-particle system, ''P<sub>1</sub>'' and ''P<sub>2</sub>'', with masses ''m<sub>1</sub>'' and ''m<sub>2</sub>'' is given by\n:<math> \\mathbf{R} = \\frac{1}{m_1+m_2}(m_1 \\mathbf{r}_1 + m_2\\mathbf{r}_2).</math>\nLet the percentage of the total mass divided between these two particles vary from 100% ''P<sub>1</sub>'' and 0% ''P<sub>2</sub>'' through 50% ''P<sub>1</sub>'' and 50% ''P<sub>2</sub>'' to 0% ''P<sub>1</sub>'' and 100% ''P<sub>2</sub>'', then the center of mass '''R''' moves along the line from ''P<sub>1</sub>'' to ''P<sub>2</sub>''.  The percentages of mass at each point can be viewed as projective coordinates of the point '''R''' on this line, and are termed barycentric coordinates. Another way of interpreting the process here is the mechanical balancing of moments about an arbitrary point. The numerator gives the total moment that is then balanced by an equivalent total force at the center of mass. This can be generalized to three points and four points to define projective coordinates in the plane, and in space, respectively.\n\n==={{anchor|Cluster straddling}}Systems with periodic boundary conditions===\nFor particles in a system with [[periodic boundary conditions]] two particles can be neighbours even though they are on opposite sides of the system. This occurs often in [[molecular dynamics]] simulations, for example, in which clusters form at random locations and sometimes neighbouring atoms cross the periodic boundary. When a cluster straddles the periodic boundary, a naive calculation of the center of mass will be incorrect. A generalized method for calculating the center of mass for periodic systems is to treat each coordinate, ''x'' and ''y'' and/or ''z'', as if it were on a circle instead of a line.<ref>{{cite journal\n | first = Linge\n | last = Bai\n | author2=Breen, David\n | date = 2008\n | title = Calculating Center of Mass in an Unbounded 2D Environment\n | journal = Journal of Graphics, GPU, and Game Tools\n | volume = 13\n | issue = 4\n | pages = 53\u201360\n | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/2151237X.2008.10129266\n | doi =  10.1080/2151237X.2008.10129266\n }}</ref>\nThe calculation takes every particle's ''x'' coordinate and maps it to an angle,\n \n:<math>\\theta_i = \\frac{x_i}{x_{max}} 2 \\pi </math>\n \nwhere ''x''<sub>max</sub> is the system size in the ''x'' direction and <math>x_i\\in[0,x_{max})</math>.

The utility of the algorithm is that it allows the mathematics to determine where the \"best\" center of mass is, instead of guessing or using [[cluster analysis]] to \"unfold\" a cluster straddling the periodic boundaries. It must be noted that if both average values are zero, <math>(\\overline{\\xi},\\overline{\\zeta}) = (0,0)</math>, then <math>\\overline{\\theta}</math> is undefined. This is a correct result, because it only occurs when all particles are exactly evenly spaced. In that condition, their ''x'' coordinates are mathematically identical in a [[periodic boundary conditions#Practical implementation: continuity and the minimum image convention|periodic system]].\n\n==Center of gravity==\n{{main|Centers of gravity in non-uniform fields}}\n\nA body's center of gravity is the point around which the [[resultant force|resultant torque]] due to gravity forces vanishes. Where a gravity field can be considered to be uniform, the mass-center and the center-of-gravity will be the same.  However, for satellites in orbit around a planet, in the absence of other torques being applied to a satellite, the slight variation (gradient) in gravitational field between closer-to (stronger) and further-from (weaker) the planet can lead to a torque that will tend to align the satellite such that its long axis is vertical.  In such a case, it is important to make the distinction between the center-of-gravity and the mass-center.  Any horizontal offset between the two will result in an applied torque.\n\nIt is useful to note that the mass-center is a fixed property for a given rigid body (e.g. with no slosh or articulation), whereas the center-of-gravity may, in addition, depend upon its orientation in a non-uniform gravitational field.  In the latter case, the center-of-gravity will always be located somewhat closer to the main attractive body as compared to the mass-center, and thus will change its position in the body of interest as its orientation is changed.\n\nIn the study of the dynamics of aircraft, vehicles and vessels, forces and moments need to be resolved relative to the mass center. That is true independent of whether gravity itself is a consideration.  Referring to the mass-center as the center-of-gravity is something of a colloquialism, but it is in common usage and when gravity gradient effects are negligible, center-of-gravity and mass-center are the same and are used interchangeably.\n\nIn physics the benefits of using the center of mass to model a mass distribution can be seen by considering the [[resultant force|resultant]] of the gravity forces on a continuous body.  Consider a body Q of volume V with density \u03c1('''r''') at each point  '''r''' in the volume.  In a parallel gravity field the force '''f''' at each point '''r''' is given by,\n:<math> \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{r}) =  -dm\\, g\\vec{k}= -\\rho(\\mathbf{r})dV\\,g\\vec{k},</math>\nwhere dm is the mass at the point '''r''', g is the acceleration of gravity, and ''k'' is a unit vector defining the vertical direction.\nChoose a reference point '''R''' in the volume and compute the [[resultant force]] and torque at this point,\n:<math> \\mathbf{F} = \\iiint\\limits_{Q} \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{r}) =  \\iiint\\limits_{Q}\\rho(\\mathbf{r})dV( -g\\vec{k}) = -Mg\\vec{k},</math>\nand\n:<math> \\mathbf{T} =  \\iiint\\limits_{Q} (\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{R})\\times \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\iiint\\limits_{Q} (\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{R})\\times   (-g\\rho(\\mathbf{r})dV\\vec{k} )= \\left(\\iiint\\limits_{Q} \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) (\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{R})dV \\right)\\times   (-g\\vec{k}) .</math>\nIf the reference point '''R''' is chosen so that it is the center of mass, then\n:<math> \\iiint\\limits_{Q} \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) (\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{R})dV =0, </math>\nwhich means the resultant torque '''T'''=0.  Because the resultant torque is zero the body will move as though it is a particle with its mass concentrated at the center of mass.\n\nBy selecting the center of gravity as the reference point for a rigid body, the gravity forces will not cause the body to rotate, which means the weight of the body can be considered to be concentrated at the center of mass.\n\n==Linear and angular momentum==\nThe linear and angular momentum of a collection of particles can be simplified by measuring the position and velocity of the particles relative to the center of mass.  Let the system of particles ''P<sub>i</sub>'', ''i''=1,...,''n'' of masses ''m<sub>i</sub>'' be located at the coordinates '''r'''<sub>''i''</sub> with velocities '''v'''<sub>''i''</sub>.  Select a reference point '''R''' and compute the relative position and velocity vectors,\n:<math> \\mathbf{r}_i = (\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{R}) + \\mathbf{R}, \\quad \\mathbf{v}_i = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{R}) + \\mathbf{v}.</math>\nThe total linear and angular momentum vectors relative to the reference point '''R''' are\n:<math> \\mathbf{p} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{R})\\right) + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i\\right) \\mathbf{v},</math>\nand\n:<math> \\mathbf{L} = \\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (\\mathbf{r}_i-\\mathbf{R})\\times \\frac{d}{dt}(\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{R}) + \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (\\mathbf{r}_i-\\mathbf{R})\\right)\\times\\mathbf{v}.</math>\n\nIf '''R''' is chosen as the center of mass these equations simplify to\n:<math> \\mathbf{p} = m\\mathbf{v},\\quad \\mathbf{L} = \\sum_{i=1}^n m_i (\\mathbf{r}_i-\\mathbf{R})\\times \\frac{d}{dt}(\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{R}),</math>\nwhere ''m'' is the total mass of all the particles, '''p''' is the linear momentum, and '''L''' is the angular momentum.\n\nNewton's laws of motion require that for any system with no external forces the momentum of the system is constant, which means the center of mass moves with constant velocity.  This applies for all systems with classical internal forces, including magnetic fields, electric fields, chemical reactions, and so on.  More formally, this is true for any internal forces that satisfy [[Newton's Third Law]].{{sfn|Kleppner|Kolenkow|1973|p=117}}\n<!-- this section is redundant and may have some errors----\nThe total momentum for any system of particles is given by\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{p}=m\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{cm},</math>\n\nwhere ''m'' indicates the total mass, and '''v'''<sub>cm</sub> is the velocity of the center of mass.{{sfn|Kleppner|Kolenkow|1973|p=116}} This velocity can be computed by taking the time derivative of the position of the center of mass. An analogue to [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Second Law]] is\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a}_\\mathrm{cm},</math>\n\nwhere '''F''' indicates the sum of all external forces on the system, and '''a'''<sub>cm</sub> indicates the acceleration of the center of mass.

Thus, the center of mass of a circular cylinder of constant density has its center of mass on the axis of the cylinder.  In the same way, the center of mass of a spherically symmetric body of constant density is at the center of the sphere.  In general, for any symmetry of a body, its center of mass will be a fixed point of that symmetry.{{sfn|Feynman|Leighton|Sands|1963|p=19.3}}\n\n===In two dimensions===\nAn experimental method for locating the center of mass is to suspend the object from two locations and to drop [[plumb line]]s from the suspension points.

In this case, one can subdivide the complex shape into simpler, more elementary shapes, whose centers of mass are easy to find. If the total mass and center of mass can be determined for each area, then the center of mass of the whole is the weighted average of the centers.{{sfn|Feynman|Leighton|Sands|1963|pp=19.1\u201319.2}} This method can even work for objects with holes, which can be accounted for as negative masses.{{sfn|Hamill|2009|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nA direct development of the [[planimeter]] known as an integraph, or integerometer, can be used to establish the position of the [[centroid]] or center of mass of an irregular two-dimensional shape.

This is the point about which the Earth and Moon orbit as they travel around the [[Sun]].

The human body\u2019s center of mass is always changing because it is not a fixed shape. Typically, a human\u2019s center of mass is detected with a reaction board or the segmentation method. The reaction board is a static analysis that involves the person lying down on the reaction board, and using the static equilibrium equation to find the center of mass. The segmentation method is a mathematic solution that states that the summation of the torques of individual body sections relative to a specified axis must equal the torque of the whole body system relative to the same axis.{{sfn|Vint|2003|pp=1\u201311}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=24em|small=yes}}\n* [[Barycenter]]\n* [[Buoyancy]]\n* [[Center of mass (relativistic)]]\n* [[Center of percussion]]\n* [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)]]\n* [[Center of pressure (terrestrial locomotion)]]\n* [[Centroid]]\n* [[Circumcenter of mass]]\n* [[Expected value]]\n* [[Mass point geometry]]\n* [[Metacentric height]]\n* [[Roll center]]\n* [[Weight distribution]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Citation |last=Baron |first=Margaret E. |date=2004 |origyear=1969 |title=The Origins of the Infinitesimal Calculus |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |isbn=0-486-49544-2}}\n*{{Citation |last=Beatty |first=Millard F. |date=2006 |title=Principles of Engineering Mechanics, Volume 2: Dynamics\u2014The Analysis of Motion |publisher=Springer |series=Mathematical Concepts and Methods in Science and Engineering |volume=33 |isbn=0-387-23704-6}}\n*{{Citation |last=Feynman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Feynman |first2=Robert |last2=Leighton |author2-link=Robert B.
