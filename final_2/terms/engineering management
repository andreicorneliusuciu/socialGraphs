Engineering management is a career that brings together the technological problem-solving savvy of engineering and the organizational, administrative, and planning abilities of management in order to oversee complex enterprises from conception to completion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allengineeringschools.com/engineering-degree/all-degrees/engineering-management/california|title=All Engineering Schools Offering Engineering Degrees|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903184234/http://www.allengineeringschools.com/engineering-degree/all-degrees/engineering-management/california|archivedate=September 3, 2011}}</ref> A Master of Science in Engineering Management (MSEM, or MS in Engineering Management) is sometimes compared to a Master of Business Administration (MBA) for professionals seeking a graduate degree as a qualifying credential for a career in engineering management.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gordon.tufts.edu/programs/m-s-in-engineering-management/msem-vs-mba|title=MSEM vs. MBA - Gordon Institute|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nEngineering management is considered to be a subdiscipline of [[industrial engineering]]/[[systems engineering]]. \nSuccessful engineering managers typically require training and experience in [[business]] and [[engineering]]. Technically inept managers tend to be deprived of support by their technical team, and non-commercial managers tend to lack commercial acumen to deliver in a [[market economy]]. Largely, engineering managers manage engineers who are driven by non-entrepreneurial thinking, and thus require the necessary people skills to coach, mentor and motivate technical professionals. Engineering professionals joining manufacturing companies sometimes become engineering managers by default after a period of time. They are required to learn how to manage once they are on the job, though this is usually an ineffective way to develop managerial abilities.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==History==\n[[Stevens Institute of Technology]] is believed to have the oldest Engineering management department, established as the School of Business Engineering in 1908. This was later called the Bachelor of Engineering in Engineering Management (BEEM) program and moved into the School of Systems and Enterprises.

Topics deal with technical applications in [[software design]] and development, [[data mining]] and [[telecommunication]] as well as the organizational and social issues associated with the use of information technologies.<ref name=\"UWMGTE\"/>\n\n=== Decision engineering ===\n[[Decision engineering]] seeks to use engineering principles in the creation of a decision, which it views as an engineering artifact in its own right.  From this point of view, the creation of a decision includes agreeing to objectives, developing a detailed specification, and then creating a decision model, which captures the key cause-and-effect elements of the decision environment (a [[systems thinking]] approach) with a focus on the particular decision, instead of the entire system (which can be otherwise intractable).  Like other engineered artifacts, a decision model can be subject to [[Quality assurance]] review, and-since it is documented-is amenable to Process improvement over time. Decision engineering models draw from the information technologies described above for data supporting the decision, but are distinguished from IT in that they model the decision, not just the data supporting it.\n\n=== Management of Technology ===\nThe [[Technology management|Management of Technology]] (MOT) theme builds on the foundation of management topics in [[accounting]], [[finance]], [[economics]], [[organizational behavior]] and organizational design.

This is the first program of its kind in Canada. In Peru, Pacifico University offers a 5-year undergraduate degree in this field, the first program in this country.\n\n'''Graduate Degrees'''\n\nMany universities offer [[Master of Engineering Management]] degrees. Missouri S&T is credited with awarding the first Ph.D. in Engineering Management in 1984. The [[National Institute of Industrial Engineering]] based in [[Mumbai]] has been awarding degrees in the field of Post Graduate Diploma in Industrial Engineering since 1973 and the Fellowship (Doctoral) degrees have been awarded since 2008. Massachusetts Institute of Technology offers a Master in System Design and Management, which is a member of the Consortium of Engineering Management.\n\nStudents in the [http://emgt.ku.edu University of Kansas' Engineering Management Program] are practicing professionals employed by over 100 businesses, manufacturing, government or consulting firms.

It involves providing [[management consulting]] advice that is specific to [[engineering]]. Indifferent from the traditional focus of the, [[A T Kearney]], [[Boston Consulting Group]] and [[McKinsey & Company|McKinsey]], [[science]] and [[engineering]] requires a particularly holistic approach involving art and science. There are many branches of engineering management consultancy (commerce), including [[law]], [[accounting]], [[human resources]], [[marketing]], [[politics]], [[economics]], [[finance]], [[Public administration|public affairs]], and [[communication]]. Commonly, engineering management consultants are also used when firms require special [[Technology|technical]] knowledge, though many prefer to use [[engineering educational consultants]] for such a task, to upgrade organizational [[knowledge]] and in able to keep the [[intellectual property]] confidential. Though many firms opt to use traditional [[management consulting]] firms, many lack the know-how to tailor the traditional theories to accommodate professional engineers and other technical workers.\n\nEngineering management consulting is concerned with the development, improvement, implementation and evaluation of integrated systems of people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy, materials and/or processes. Consultants strive to improve upon existing processes, products or systems. Engineering management consulting draws upon the principles and methods of engineering analysis and synthesis, as well as the mathematical, physical and [[social sciences]] together with the principles and methods of engineering design to specify, predict, and evaluate the results to be obtained from such systems or processes. Engineering management consulting puts a focus on the social impact of the product, process or system that is being analyzed.\n\nExamples of where engineering management consulting might be used include designing new product development process, or an assembly workstation, strategizing for various operational logistics, consulting as an efficiency expert, developing a new financial algorithm or loan system for a bank, streamlining operation and emergency room location or usage in a hospital, planning complex distribution schemes for materials or products (referred to as [[Supply Chain Management]]), and shortening lines (or [[queueing theory|queues]]) at a bank, hospital, or a theme park.  Management engineering consultants typically use [[computer simulation]] (especially [[discrete event simulation]]), along with extensive mathematical tools and modeling and computational methods for system analysis, evaluation, and optimization.\n\n==Professional organizations==\nThere are a number of societies and organizations dedicated to the field of engineering management. One of the largest societies is a division of IEEE, the Engineering Management Society, which regularly publishes a trade magazine. Another prominent professional organization in the field is the American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM), which was founded in 1979 by a group of 20 engineering managers from industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asem.org|title=American Society for Engineering Management - Home|publisher=}}</ref>  ASEM currently certifies engineering managers (two levels) via the Associate Engineering Manager (AEM) or Professional Engineering Manager (PEM) certification exam. The Master of Engineering Management Programs Consortium is a newly formed consortium of prominent universities intended to raise the value and visibility of the MEM degree.<ref>[http://www.mempc.org Master of Engineering Management Programs Consortium ]</ref>  Also, engineering management university programs have the possibility of being accredited by [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology|ABET]], [[Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering|ATMAE]], or ASEM.
