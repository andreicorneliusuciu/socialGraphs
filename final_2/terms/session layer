Communication sessions consist of requests and responses that occur between applications. Session-layer services are commonly used in application environments that make use of [[remote procedure call]]s (RPCs).\n\nAn example of a session-layer protocol is the [[OSI protocol suite]] session-layer protocol, also known as [[X.225]] or [[ISO 8327]]. In case of a connection loss this protocol may try to recover the connection. If a connection is not used for a long period, the session-layer protocol may close it and re-open it. It provides for either [[duplex (telecommunications)|full duplex]] or [[duplex (telecommunications)|half-duplex]] operation and provides [[synchronization point]]s in the stream of exchanged messages.<ref>[http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.225/en/ ITU-T Recommendation X.225]</ref>\n\nOther examples of session layer implementations include [[Zone Information Protocol]] (ZIP) \u2013 the [[AppleTalk]] protocol that coordinates the name binding process, and Session Control Protocol (SCP) \u2013 the [[DECnet]] Phase IV session-layer protocol.\n\nWithin the service layering semantics of the OSI network architecture, the session layer responds to service requests from the [[presentation layer]] and issues service requests to the [[transport layer]].\n\n==Services==\n*[[Authentication]]\n*[[Authorization]]\n*[[Session restoration]] ([[checkpointing]] and recovery)\n\nThe session layer of the OSI model is responsible for session [[checkpointing]] and recovery. It allows information of different streams, perhaps originating from different sources, to be properly combined or synchronized.\n\nAn example usage of the session layer is [[Enterprise JavaBeans#Session beans|session beans]], which are only active as long as the session is active, and are deleted when the session is disconnected.  Java developers can use them to store information about the user during a web session.\n\nAn example application is [[web conferencing]], in which the streams of audio and video must be synchronous to avoid so-called [[lip synch]] problems. [[Flow control (data)|Flow control]] ensures that the person displayed on screen is the current speaker.\n\nAnother application is in [[live TV]] programs, where streams of audio and video need to be seamlessly merged and transitioned from one to the other to avoid silent airtime or excessive overlap.\n\n==Protocols==\n{{colbegin||27em}}\n*ADSP, [[AppleTalk|AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol]]\n*ASP, [[AppleTalk|AppleTalk Session Protocol]]\n*H.245, [[H.245|Call Control Protocol for Multimedia Communication]]\n*ISO-SP, OSI session-layer protocol (X.225, ISO 8327)\n*iSNS, [[ISNS|Internet Storage Name Service]]\n*L2F, [[L2F|Layer 2 Forwarding Protocol]]\n*L2TP, [[L2TP|Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol]]\n*NetBIOS, [[NetBIOS|Network Basic Input Output System]]\n*PAP, [[Password Authentication Protocol]]\n*PPTP, [[PPTP|Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol]]\n*RPC, [[remote procedure call|Remote Procedure Call Protocol]]\n*RTCP, [[RTCP|Real-time Transport Control Protocol]]\n*SMPP, [[SMPP|Short Message Peer-to-Peer]]\n*SCP, [[Session Control Protocol]]\n*SOCKS, the [[SOCKS]] internet protocol, see [[Internet socket]]\n*ZIP, [[Zone Information Protocol]]\n*SDP, [[Sockets Direct Protocol]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Comparison with TCP/IP model==\nThe [[TCP/IP reference model]] does not concern itself with the OSI model's details of application or transport protocol semantics and therefore does not consider a session layer. OSI's session management in connection with the typical transport protocols (TCP, SCTP), is contained in the [[transport layer|transport-layer]] protocols, or otherwise considered the realm of the [[application layer]] protocols. TCP/IP's layers are ''descriptions'' of operating scopes (application, host-to-host, network, link) and not detailed ''prescriptions'' of operating procedures or data semantics.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Session (computer science)]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:OSI protocols]]\n[[Category:Session layer protocols| ]]"}]}}}}
