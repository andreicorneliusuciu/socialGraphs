Robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within. Robots may be constructed to take on human form but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to how they look.\n\nRobots can be [[autonomous robot|autonomous]] or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as [[Honda]]'s ''Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility'' ([[ASIMO]]) and [[TOSY]]'s ''TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot'' ([[TOPIO]]) to [[industrial robot]]s, medical operating robots, patent assist robots, dog therapy robots, collectively programmed [[Swarm robotics|''swarm'' robots]], [[UAV drones]] such as [[General Atomics MQ-1 Predator]], and even microscopic [[Nanorobotics|nano robots]].

He wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of [[neurons|brain cells]] could give rise to very complex [[behavior]]s - essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up. His first robots, named ''Elmer'' and ''Elsie'', were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as ''tortoises'' due to their shape and slow rate of movement. The three-wheeled tortoise robots were capable of [[phototaxis]], by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power.\n\nWalter stressed the importance of using purely [[wiktionary:analogue|analogue]] electronics to [[simulate]] brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as [[Alan Turing]] and [[John von Neumann]] were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of [[digital data|digital]] [[computation]].

[[ROS (Robot Operating System)|Robot Operating System]] is an open-source set of programs being developed at [[Stanford University]], the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and the [[Technical University of Munich]], Germany, among others. ROS provides ways to program a robot's navigation and limbs regardless of the specific hardware involved. It also provides high-level commands for items like image recognition and even opening doors. When ROS boots up on a robot's computer, it would obtain data on attributes such as the length and movement of robots' limbs. It would relay this data to higher-level algorithms.

The play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of these living creatures, but in their appearance they prefigure modern ideas of [[android (robot)|androids]], creatures who can be mistaken for humans. These mass-produced workers are depicted as efficient but emotionless, incapable of original thinking and indifferent to self-preservation. At issue is whether the robots are being [[Exploitation of labour|exploited]] and the consequences of human dependence upon commodified labor (especially after a number of specially-formulated robots achieve self-awareness and incite robots all around the world to rise up against the humans).\n\nKarel \u010capek himself did not coin the word. He wrote a short letter in reference to an [[etymology]] in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in which he named his brother, the painter and writer [[Josef \u010capek]], as its actual originator.<ref name=\"KapekWebsite\" />\n\nIn an article in the Czech journal ''[[Lidov\u00e9 noviny]]'' in 1933, he explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures ''labo\u0159i'' (\"workers\", from [[Latin]] ''labor''). However, he did not like the word, and sought advice from his brother Josef, who suggested \"roboti\".  The word ''robota'' means literally \"[[corv\u00e9e]]\", \"serf labor\", and figuratively \"drudgery\" or \"hard work\" in [[Czech language|Czech]] and also (more general) \"work\", \"labor\" in  many [[Slavic languages]] (e.g.: [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], archaic [[Czech language|Czech]], as well as ''robot'' in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]). Traditionally the ''robota'' (Hungarian ''robot'') was the work period a serf ([[corv\u00e9e]]) had to give for his lord, typically 6 months of the year. The origin of the word is the [[Old Church Slavonic]] ([[Old Bulgarian]]) ''rabota'' \"servitude\" (\"work\" in contemporary [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]), which in turn comes from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*orbh-''. ''Robot'' is [[cognate]] with the German root ''Arbeit'' (work).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE363.html |title=Indo-European root '&#39;*orbh-'&#39; |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-05-12 |accessdate=2014-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124172123/http://bartleby.com/61/roots/IE363.html |archivedate=January 24, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=robot&searchmode=or|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2012-06-10}}</ref>\n\nThe word [[robotics]], used to describe this field of study,<ref name=\"OED\" /> was coined by the science fiction writer [[Isaac Asimov]].

Freeman]].\n\n=== Modular robot ===\n{{ main | Self-reconfiguring modular robot }}\nModular robots are a new breed of robots that are designed to increase the utilization of robots by modularizing their architecture.<ref>P. Moubarak, et al., Modular and Reconfigurable Mobile Robotics, Journal of Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 60 (12) (2012) 1648 \u2013 1663.</ref> The functionality and effectiveness of a modular robot is easier to increase compared to conventional robots. These robots are composed of a single type of identical, several different identical module types, or similarly shaped modules, which vary in size. Their architectural structure allows hyper-redundancy for modular robots, as they can be designed with more than 8 degrees of freedom (DOF). Creating the programming, inverse kinematics and dynamics for modular robots is more complex than with traditional robots. Modular robots may be composed of L-shaped modules, cubic modules, and U and H-shaped modules. ANAT technology, an early modular robotic technology patented by Robotics Design Inc., allows the creation of modular robots from U and H shaped modules that connect in a chain, and are used to form heterogeneous and homogenous modular robot systems. These \u201cANAT robots\u201d can be designed with \u201cn\u201d DOF as each module is a complete motorized robotic system that folds relatively to the modules connected before and after it in its chain, and therefore a single module allows one degree of freedom. The more modules that are connected to one another, the more degrees of freedom it will have. L-shaped modules can also be designed in a chain, and must become increasingly smaller as the size of the chain increases, as payloads attached to the end of the chain place a greater strain on modules that are further from the base. ANAT H-shaped modules do not suffer from this problem, as their design allows a modular robot to distribute pressure and impacts evenly amongst other attached modules, and therefore payload-carrying capacity does not decrease as the length of the arm increases. Modular robots can be manually or self-reconfigured to form a different robot, that may perform different applications. Because modular robots of the same architecture type are composed of modules that compose different modular robots, a snake-arm robot can combine with another to form a dual or quadra-arm robot, or can split into several mobile robots, and mobile robots can split into multiple smaller ones, or combine with others into a larger or different one. This allows a single modular robot the ability to be fully specialized in a single task, as well as the capacity to be specialized to perform multiple different tasks.\n\nModular robotic technology is currently being applied in hybrid transportation,<ref name=\"Modular flying car\">{{cite news|url=http://www.aerobuzz.fr/spip.php?article2346|title=Le consortium franco-qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Mix d\u00e9voile son projet de voiture volante|last=R\u00e9daction|date=December 25, 2011|work=http://www.aerobuzz.fr/|publisher=http://www.aerobuzz.fr/|language=French|accessdate=September 7, 2012}}</ref> industrial automation,<ref name=\"Ep&T Magazine\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ept.ca/issues/story.aspx?aid=1000348213|title=Modularity in robotics provides automation for all|last=Scanlan|first=Steve, Robotics Design Inc., Montreal|publisher=Digital.ept.ca |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}</ref> duct cleaning<ref name=\"Plumbing and HVAC\">{{cite news|url=http://www.roboticsdesign.qc.ca/assets/Uploads/PDF-content/InThePress/HVAC/Pluming+HVACmagazineapril2010.pdf|title=Duct cleaning robots|last=Plumbing and HVAC|first=Magazine |date=April 2010|work=roboticsdesign.qc.ca/news.html|publisher=http://plumbingandhvac.ca/|accessdate=April 29, 2010}}</ref> and handling.

A robot might be designed to perform one particular task extremely well, or a range of tasks less well. Of course, all robots by their nature can be re-programmed to behave differently, but some are limited by their physical form. For example, a factory robot arm can perform jobs such as cutting, welding, gluing, or acting as a fairground ride, while a pick-and-place robot can only populate printed circuit boards.\n\n=== General-purpose autonomous robots ===\n{{Main|Autonomous robot}}\nGeneral-purpose autonomous robots can perform a variety of functions independently. General-purpose autonomous robots typically can navigate independently in known spaces, handle their own re-charging needs, interface with electronic doors and elevators and perform other basic tasks. Like computers, general-purpose robots can link with networks, software and accessories that increase their usefulness. They may recognize people or objects, talk, provide companionship, monitor environmental quality, respond to alarms, pick up supplies and perform other useful tasks. General-purpose robots may perform a variety of functions simultaneously or they may take on different roles at different times of day. Some such robots try to mimic human beings and may even resemble people in appearance; this type of robot is called a humanoid robot. Humanoid robots are still in a very limited stage, as no humanoid robot can, as of yet, actually navigate around a room that it has never been in. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} Thus, humanoid robots are really quite limited, despite their intelligent behaviors in their well-known environments.\n\n=== Factory robots ===\n\n====Car production====\nOver the last three decades, [[automotive industry|automobile factories]] have become dominated by robots. A typical factory contains hundreds of [[industrial robot]]s working on fully automated production lines, with one robot for every ten human workers.  On an automated production line, a vehicle chassis on a conveyor is [[welding|welded]], [[adhesive|glued]], painted and finally assembled at a sequence of robot stations.\n\n====Packaging====\nIndustrial robots are also used extensively for palletizing and packaging of manufactured goods, for example for rapidly taking drink cartons from the end of a conveyor belt and placing them into boxes, or for loading and unloading machining centers.\n\n====Electronics====\nMass-produced [[printed circuit board]]s (PCBs) are almost exclusively manufactured by pick-and-place robots, typically with [[SCARA]] manipulators, which remove tiny [[electronic component]]s from strips or trays, and place them on to PCBs with great accuracy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactsystems.com/c5_series.html |publisher=Contact Systems |title=Contact Systems Pick and Place robots|accessdate=2008-09-21}}</ref> Such robots can place hundreds of thousands of components per hour, far out-performing a human in speed, accuracy, and reliability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assembleon.com/surface-mount-assembly/pick-and-place-equipment/a-series/|publisher=Assembleon| title=SMT pick-and-place equipment|accessdate=2008-09-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080803173021/http://www.assembleon.com/surface-mount-assembly/pick-and-place-equipment/a-series/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-08-03}}</ref>\n\n====Automated guided vehicles (AGVs)====\n[[File:ADAM Intelligent AGV.jpg|thumb|right|An intelligent AGV drops-off goods without needing lines or beacons in the workspace]]\nMobile robots, following markers or wires in the floor, or using vision<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smartcaddy.net|title=Smart Caddy|publisher=Seegrid|accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref> or lasers, are used to transport goods around large facilities, such as warehouses, container ports, or hospitals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agvsystems.com/basics/vehicle.htm|title=The Basics of Automated Guided Vehicles|publisher=Savant Automation, AGV Systems|accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref>\n\n=====Early AGV-style robots=====\nLimited to tasks that could be accurately defined and had to be performed the same way every time. Very little feedback or intelligence was required, and the robots needed only the most basic [[wikt:exteroceptors|exteroceptors]] (sensors). The limitations of these AGVs are that their paths are not easily altered and they cannot alter their paths if obstacles block them. If one AGV breaks down, it may stop the entire operation.\n\n=====Interim AGV technologies=====\nDeveloped to deploy triangulation from beacons or bar code grids for scanning on the floor or ceiling. In most factories, triangulation systems tend to require moderate to high maintenance, such as daily cleaning of all beacons or bar codes. Also, if a tall pallet or large vehicle blocks beacons or a bar code is marred, AGVs may become lost. Often such AGVs are designed to be used in human-free environments.\n\n=====Intelligent AGVs (i-AGVs)=====\nSuch as SmartLoader,<ref>{{cite web|title=Jervis B.

They navigate by recognizing natural features. [[3D scanner]]s or other means of sensing the environment in two or three dimensions help to eliminate cumulative [[observational error|errors]] in [[dead reckoning|dead-reckoning]] calculations of the AGV's current position.  Some AGVs can create maps of their environment using scanning lasers with [[simultaneous localization and mapping]] (SLAM) and use those maps to navigate in real time with other path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms. They are able to operate in complex environments and perform non-repetitive and non-sequential tasks such as transporting [[photomask]]s in a semiconductor lab, specimens in hospitals and goods in warehouses. For dynamic areas, such as warehouses full of pallets, AGVs require additional strategies using three-dimensional sensors such as time-of-flight or stereovision cameras.\n\n=== Dirty, dangerous, dull or inaccessible tasks ===\nThere are many jobs which humans would rather leave to robots.

They are used when a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it is dangerous, far away, or inaccessible. The robot may be in another room or another country, or may be on a very different scale to the operator. For instance, a laparoscopic surgery robot allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery, significantly shortening recovery time.<ref name=\"daVinci\" /> They can also be used to avoid exposing workers to the hazardous and tight spaces such as in [[Duct (HVAC)|duct]] cleaning.<!--<ref>{{cite news|url=http://on.fb.me/1o843oN |title=The Trouble with Regulation |publisher=National Air Duct Cleaning Association |accessdate=2014-11-25 | date=March\u2013April 2014}}</ref>--> When disabling a bomb, the operator sends a small robot to disable it.

FRIEND make it possible for [[patients]] who are [[paraplegia|paraplegic]], have muscle diseases or serious [[paralysis]] (due to strokes etc.), to perform tasks without help from other people like therapists or nursing staff.\n\n====Pharmacies====\n{{Main|Pharmacy automation}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}\nScript Pro manufactures a robot designed to help pharmacies fill prescriptions that consist of oral solids or [[pharmaceutical drug|medications]] in pill form. The [[pharmacist]] or [[pharmacy technician]] enters the prescription information into its information system. The system, upon determining whether or not the drug is in the robot, will send the information to the robot for filling. The robot has 3 different size vials to fill determined by the size of the pill. The robot technician, user, or pharmacist determines the needed size of the vial based on the tablet when the robot is stocked. Once the vial is filled it is brought up to a conveyor belt that delivers it to a holder that spins the vial and attaches the patient label. Afterwards it is set on another conveyor that delivers the patient\u2019s medication vial to a slot labeled with the patient's name on an LED read out. The pharmacist or technician then checks the contents of the vial to ensure it\u2019s the correct drug for the correct patient and then seals the vials and sends it out front to be picked up. The robot is a very time efficient device that the pharmacy depends on to fill prescriptions.\n\nMcKesson's Robot RX is another healthcare robotics product that helps pharmacies dispense thousands of medications daily with little or no errors. The robot can be ten feet wide and thirty feet long and can hold hundreds of different kinds of medications and thousands of doses. The pharmacy saves many resources like staff members that are otherwise unavailable in a resource scarce industry. It uses an [[electromechanics|electromechanical]] head coupled with a [[pneumatics|pneumatic]] system to capture each dose and deliver it to its either stocked or dispensed location. The head moves along a single axis while it rotates 180 degrees to pull the medications. During this process it uses [[barcode]] technology to verify its pulling the correct drug. It then delivers the drug to a patient specific bin on a conveyor belt. Once the bin is filled with all of the drugs that a particular patient needs and that the robot stocks, the bin is then released and returned out on the conveyor belt to a technician waiting to load it into a cart for delivery to the floor.\n\n=== Research robots ===\n{{See also|Robotics#Robotics_research|l1=Robotics research}}\nWhile most robots today are installed in factories or homes, performing labour or life saving jobs, many new types of robot are being developed in [[laboratory|laboratories]] around the world. Much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks, but on investigations into new types of robot, alternative ways to think about or design robots, and new ways to manufacture them. It is expected that these new types of robot will be able to solve real world problems when they are finally realized.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n==== Bionic and biomimetic robots ====\n{{further|Bionics}}\n{{further|Biomimetics}}\n\nOne approach to designing robots is to base them on animals.

A common theme is the development of a master race of conscious and highly intelligent robots, motivated to take over or destroy the human race. \n''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818), often called the first science fiction novel, has become synonymous with the theme of a robot or android advancing beyond its creator.\n\nOther works with similar themes include ''[[The Mechanical Man]]'', ''[[The Terminator]], [[Runaway (1984 film)|Runaway]], [[RoboCop]]'', the [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicators in ''Stargate'']], the [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylons]] in ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', the [[Cybermen]] and [[Dalek]]s in ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[Enthiran]]'' and ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]''. Some fictional robots are programmed to kill and destroy; others gain superhuman intelligence and abilities by upgrading their own software and hardware. Examples of popular media where the robot becomes evil are ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', ''[[Red Planet (film)|Red Planet]]'' and ''[[Enthiran]]''. \n\nAnother common theme is the reaction, sometimes called the \"[[uncanny valley]]\", of unease and even revulsion at the sight of robots that mimic humans too closely.<ref name=\"uncanny\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.macdorman.com/kfm/writings/pubs/Ho2007EmotionUncanny.pdf |first=C.
