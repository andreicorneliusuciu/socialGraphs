It is a [[plasma propulsion engine]] using perpendicular [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s to accelerate a [[propellant]] with no [[electrode]].\n\n== Operation ==\n\nA [[nozzle]] releases a puff of gas which spreads across a flat spiraling [[induction coil]] of [[wire]] about 1 meter across. A bank of [[capacitor]]s releases a pulse of [[high voltage]] [[electric current]] of tens of kilovolts lasting 10 microseconds into the coil, generating a radial magnetic field. This [[electromagnetic induction|induces]] a circular electrical field in the gas, [[Ionization|ionizing]] it and causing [[charged particle]]s (free [[electrons]] and [[ion]]s) to revolve in the opposite direction as the original pulse of current. Because the motion of this induced current flow is perpendicular to the magnetic field, the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] is accelerated out into space by the [[Lorentz force]] at a high exhaust velocity (10 to 100 km/s).<ref>Dailey, C. Lee; Lovberg, Ralph H. (July 1993). [http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930023164_1993023164.pdf \"The PIT MkV Pulsed Inductive Thruster\"]. NASA CR 191155.</ref>\n\n== Advantages ==\n\nUnlike an [[electrostatic ion thruster]] which uses an [[electric field]] to accelerate only one [[Chemical species|species]] (positive ions), a PIT uses the Lorentz body force acting upon all charged particles within a quasi-neutral plasma. Unlike most other ion and plasma thrusters, it also requires no [[electrode]]s (which are susceptible to erosion) and its power can be scaled up simply by increasing the number of pulses per second. A 1-[[megawatt]] system would pulse 200 times per second. \n\nPulsed inductive thrusters can maintain constant [[specific impulse]] and thrust efficiency over a wide range of input power levels by adjusting the pulse rate to maintain a constant discharge energy per pulse. It has demonstrated efficiency greater than 50%.<ref name=\"NuPIT\">{{cite conference\n |last1= Frisbee |first1= Robert H.\n |last2= Mikellides |first2 = Ioannis G.\n |title= The Nuclear-Electric Pulsed Inductive Thruster (NuPIT): Mission Analysis for Prometheus\n |date= July 2005\n |conference= 41st AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit\n |location= Tucson, Arizona\n |url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/38357/1/05-1846.pdf\n |format=PDF\n |accessdate=April 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPulsed inductive thrusters can use a wide range of gases as a propellant, such as [[water]], [[hydrazine]], [[ammonia]], [[argon]], [[xenon]]\u2026 Due to this ability, it has been suggested to use PITs for [[Mars|Martian]] missions: an orbiter could refuel by scooping [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] from the [[atmosphere of Mars]], compressing the gas and liquefying it into [[storage tank]]s for the return journey or another [[interplanetary mission]], whilst orbiting the planet.<ref>Polzin, Kurt A.

NASA conducts experiments on this device since the early 1980s.\n\n=== PIT Mk V, VI and VII ===\n\nNGST ([[Northrop Grumman|Northrop Grumman Space Technology]]), as a contractor for NASA, built several experimental PITs. \n\nResearch efforts during the first period (1965-1973) were aimed at understanding the structure of an inductive current sheet and evaluating different concepts for propellant injection and preionization. \n\nIn the second period (1979-1988), the focus shifted more towards developing a true propulsion system and increasing the performance of the base design through incremental design changes, with the build of '''Mk I''' and '''Mk IV''' prototypes. \n\nThe third period (1991-today) began with the introduction of a new PIT thruster design known as the '''Mk V'''. It evolved into the '''Mk VI''', developed to reproduce Mk V single-shot tests, which completely characterize thruster performance. It uses an improved coil of hollow copper tube construction and an improved propellant valve, but is electrically identical to the Mk V, using the same capacitors and switches.<ref>{{cite conference \n |last1= Russell |first1= Derrek\n |last2= Dailey |first2= C.\n |last3= Goldstein |first3= Wayne\n |last4= Lovberg |first4= Ralph\n |last5= Poylio |first5= James\n |last6= Jackson |first6= Bernard\n |last7= Lovberg |first7= Ralph H.\n |last8= Dailey |first8= C.
