It is also known as a '''gynoid''', though this term is more recent. Fembots appear widely in science fiction film and art. As more realistic humanoid robot design is technologically possible, they are also emerging in real-life robot design.\n\n==Name==\n\nThe [[portmanteau]] '''fembot''' (female robot) was popularized by the television series ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'' in the episode \"Kill Oscar\" (1976) <ref>Julie Wosk, My Fair Ladies: Female Robots, Androids, and Other Artificial Eves, Rutgers Univ. Press, 2015,  pp. 114\u2013115</ref> and later used in the [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] films,<ref name=popscibots/> among others. '''Robotess''' is the oldest female-specific term, originating in 1921 from the [[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)|same source]] as the term ''[[robot]]''.\n\nA '''gynoid''' is anything that resembles or pertains to the [[female]] [[human]] form. Though the term ''[[Android (robot)|android]]'' refers to robotic humanoids regardless of apparent gender, the Greek prefix \"andr-\" refers to ''man'' in the masculine gendered sense.<ref>Liddell and Scott: Greek Lexicon.</ref> Because of this prefix, many read ''Android'' as referring to male-styled robots.<ref name=melzer202/><ref name=technophob77/><ref name=Tatsumi/><ref name=desirbody21/><ref name=Foster103/>\n\nThe term ''gynoid'' was used by [[Gwyneth Jones (novelist)|Gwyneth Jones]] in her 1985 novel ''Divine Endurance'' to describe a robot slave character in a futuristic China, that is judged by her beauty.<ref name=Tatsumi>{{cite book |title= Full Metal Apache: Transactions between Cyberpunk Japan and Avant-Pop America|last= Tatsumi |first= Takayuki |authorlink= |page=213, Notes |year= 2006|publisher= Duke University Press|location= Durham NC|isbn=0-8223-3774-6}}</ref>\n\n''Gynoid'' is also used in American English medical terminology as a shortening of the term ''gynecoid'' (gynaecoid in British English).<ref name=MW1>{{cite web|title=Gynoid|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/gynoid|publisher=Merriam Webster|accessdate=26 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Female robots==\n[[Image:Actroid-DER 01.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Actroid]] at [[Expo 2005]] in [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]].]]\n\n{{quote|...the great majority of robots were either machine-like, male-like or child-like for the reasons that not only are virtually all roboticists male, but also that fembots posed greater technical difficulties.

Daniel Dinello writes that the violence with which the gynoids are treated represents Deckard's hatred of women. The third gynoid, Rachael, acts as a submissive female, even after Deckard \"virtually rapes her.\"<ref name=technophob77/> Thomas Foster writes, about the novel ''[[Dead Girls]]'' by [[Richard Calder (writer)|Richard Calder]], that the technological bodies of gynoids depict sexism in an unnatural context, highlighting its negative impact.

While not truly [[Artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]], the fembots still had extremely sophisticated programming that allowed them to pass for human in most situations. The term ''fembot'' was also used in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' (referring to a robot duplicate of the title character, a.k.a. the [[List of minor Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters#Buffybot|Buffybot]]) and ''[[Futurama]]''.<!-- These both have sources discussing their use to be added-->\n\nThe 1987 science-fiction [[cult film]] ''[[Cherry 2000]]'' also portrayed a gynoid character which was described by the male  protagonist as his \"perfect partner\".  The 1964 TV series ''[[My Living Doll]]'' features a robot, portrayed by [[Julie Newmar]], who is similarly described.\n\nMore recently, the 2015 science-fiction film ''[[Ex Machina (film)|Ex Machina]]'' featured a genius inventor experimenting with gynoids in an effort to create the perfect companion.\n\n===Gender===\nFiction about gynoids or female cyborgs reinforce essentialist ideas of femininity, according to Margret Grebowicz.<ref>{{cite book |title= SciFi in the mind's eye: reading science through science fiction|last= Grebowicz|first= Margret |authorlink= |author2=L.

In ''[[The Stepford Wives]]'', husbands are shown as desiring to restrict the independence of their wives, and obedient and stereotypical spouses are preferred. The husbands' technological method of obtaining this \"perfect wife\" is through the murder of their human wives and replacement with gynoid substitutes that are compliant and housework obsessed, resulting in a \"picture-postcard\" perfect suburban society. This has been seen as an allegory of male chauvinism of the period, by representing marriage as a master-slave relationship, and an attempt at raising feminist consciousness during the era of second wave feminism.<ref name=technophob78/>\n\nIn a parody of the fembots from ''The Bionic Woman'', attractive, blonde fembots in alluring baby-doll nightgowns were used as a lure for the fictional agent [[Austin Powers (character)|Austin Powers]] in the movie ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]''. The film's sequels had [[cameo appearance]]s of characters revealed as fembots.\n\n[[Jack Halberstam]] writes that these gynoids inform the viewer that femaleness does not indicate naturalness, and their exaggerated femininity and sexuality is used in a similar way to the title character's exaggerated masculinity, lampooning stereotypes.<ref>{{cite book |title= In a Queer Time and Place: Transgender Bodies, Subcultural Lives|last= Halberstam|first= Judith |authorlink= |year= 2005|publisher=NYU Press |page= 144|isbn=978-0-8147-3585-5}}</ref>\n\n===Sex objects===\n{{Sex in SF mini}}\nSome argue that gynoids have often been portrayed as sexual objects.
