MBT plants are designed to process [[municipal solid waste|mixed household waste]] as well as [[commercial waste|commercial]] and [[industrial waste]]s.\n\n==Process==\n[[File:Mechanical_biological_treatment_flowchart.svg|right|thumbnail|350px|Process flow chart]]\nThe terms ''mechanical biological treatment'' or ''mechanical biological pre-treatment'' relate to a group of [[list of solid waste treatment technologies|solid waste treatment systems]]. These systems enable the recovery of materials contained within the mixed waste and facilitate the stabilisation of the biodegradable component of the material.<ref>Enviros (2006) [http://www.mbt.landfill-site.com/ Mechanical biological treatment website], ''www.mbt.landfill-site.com'', Waste Technology Home Page, Accessed 22.11.06</ref><ref>Juniper (2005) [http://www.juniper.co.uk/Publications/downloads.html MBT: A Guide for Decision Makers \u2013 Processes, Policies & Markets], ''www.juniper.co.uk'', (Project funding supplied by Sita Environmental Trust), Accessed 22.11.06</ref>\n\nThe sorting component of the plants typically resemble a [[materials recovery facility]]. This component is either configured to recover the individual elements of the waste or produce a [[Refuse-derived fuel]] that can be used for the generation of power.\n\nThe components of the mixed waste stream that can be recovered include:\n\n*Ferrous [[Metal]]\n*Non-ferrous metal\n*[[Plastic]]\n*[[Glass]]\n\n==Terminology==\n\nMBT is also sometimes termed BMT \u2013  biological mechanical treatment \u2013 however this simply refers to the order of processing, i.e. the biological phase of the system precedes the mechanical sorting. MBT should not be confused with MHT \u2013 ''[[mechanical heat treatment]]''\n\n== Mechanical sorting ==\n{{See also|Materials recovery facility}}\n[[Image:MBT sorting.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|Wet material recovery facility, [[Hiriya]], [[Israel]] ]]\n\nThe \"mechanical\" element is usually an automated mechanical sorting stage. This either removes recyclable elements from a mixed waste stream (such as metals, plastics, glass and paper) or processes them. It typically involves factory style [[conveyor]]s, industrial [[magnet]]s, [[eddy current separators]], [[trommel]]s, [[Industrial shredder|shredders]]  and other tailor made systems, or the sorting is done manually at hand picking stations. The mechanical element has a number of similarities to a materials recovery facility (MRF).<ref>Sita (2004) [http://www.sita.co.uk/assets/PP_MBT.pdf Sita Mechanical Biological Treatment Position Paper], ''www.sita.co.uk'', Accessed 22.11.06</ref>\n\nSome systems integrate a wet MRF to separate by density and floatation and to recover & wash the recyclable elements of the waste in a form that can be sent for recycling. MBT can alternatively process the waste to produce a high calorific fuel termed [[refuse derived fuel]] (RDF). RDF can be used in [[cement kiln]]s or thermal combustion power plants and is generally made up from plastics and biodegradable organic waste. Systems which are configured to produce RDF include the Herhof and Ecodeco Processes. It is a common misconception that all MBT processes produce RDF. This is not the case and depends strictly on system configuration and suitable local markets for MBT outputs.\n\n== Biological processing ==\n{{See also|composting|anaerobic digestion}}\n\n[[Image:MBT anaerobicdigesters.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|Twin stage & [[UASB]] [[anaerobic digester]]s]]\n\nThe \"biological\" element refers to either:\n\n*Anaerobic digestion\n*Composting\n*Biodrying\n\nAnaerobic digestion harnesses anaerobic microorganisms to break down the [[biodegradable waste|biodegradable]] component of the waste to produce [[biogas]] and [[digestate|soil improver]]. The biogas can be used to generate [[electricity]] and [[heat]].\n\nBiological can also refer to a composting stage. Here the organic component is broken down by naturally occurring aerobic microorganisms. They breakdown the waste into carbon dioxide and compost. There is no green energy produced by systems employing only composting treatment for the biodegradable waste.\n\nIn the case of biodrying, the waste material undergoes a period of rapid heating through the action of aerobic microbes. During this partial composting stage the heat generated by the microbes result in rapid drying of the waste. These systems are often configured to produce a refuse-derived fuel where a dry, light material is advantageous for later transport and combustion.\n\nSome systems incorporate both anaerobic digestion and composting. This may either take the form of a full anaerobic digestion phase, followed by the maturation (composting) of the digestate. Alternatively a partial anaerobic digestion phase can be induced on water that is percolated through the raw waste, dissolving the readily available sugars, with the remaining material being sent to a [[windrow composting]] facility.\n\nBy processing the biodegradable waste either by anaerobic digestion or by [[compost]]ing MBT technologies help to reduce the contribution of [[greenhouse gas]]es to [[global warming]].\n\nUsable wastes for this system:\n\n*Municipal solid waste\n*Commercial and industrial waste\n*Sewage sludge\n\nPossible products of this system:\n\n*Renewable fuel (biogas) leading to renewable power\n*Recovered recycable materials such as metals, paper, plastics, glass etc.\n*Digestate - an organic fertiliser and soil improver\n*Carbon credits \u2013 additional revenues\n*High calorific fraction refuse derived fuel - Renewable fuel content dependent upon biological component\n*Residual unusable materials prepared for their final safe  treatment (e.g. [[incineration]] or [[gasification]]) and/or [[landfill]]\n\nFurther advantages:\n\n*Small fraction of inert residual waste\n*Reduction of the waste volume to be deposited to at least a half (density > 1.3 t/m\u00b3), thus the lifetime of the landfill is at least twice as long as usually\n*Utilisation of the [[leachate]] in the process\n*[[Landfill gas]] not problematic as biological component of waste has been stabilised\n*Daily covering of landfill not necessary\n\n== Consideration of applications ==\n\nMBT systems can form an integral part of a region's waste treatment infrastructure. These systems are typically integrated with [[kerbside collection]] schemes. In the event that a refuse-derived fuel is produced as a by-product then a combustion facility would be required. This could either be an incineration facility or a gasifier.\n\nAlternatively MBT solutions can diminish the need for home separation and kerbside collection of recyclable elements of waste. This gives the ability of local authorities, municipalities and councils to reduce the use of waste vehicles on the roads and keep recycling rates high.\n\n==Position of environmental groups==\n\n[[Friends of the Earth]] suggests that the best environmental route for [[municipal solid waste|residual waste]] is to firstly maximise removal of remaining recyclable materials from the waste stream (such as metals, plastics and paper). The  amount of waste remaining should be composted or anaerobically digested and disposed of to [[landfill]], unless sufficiently clean to be used as compost.\n\nA report by Eunomia<ref>Eunomia (2006) [http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/reports/changing_climate.pdf A changing climate for energy from waste?]</ref> undertook a detailed analysis of the climate impacts of different residual waste technologies. It found that an MBT process that extracts both the metals and plastics prior to landfilling is one of the best options for dealing with our residual waste, and has a lower impact than either MBT processes producing RDF for incineration or incineration of waste without MBT.\n\nFriends of the Earth does not support MBT plants that produce refuse derived fuel (RDF), and believes MBT processes should occur in small, localised treatment plants.<ref>Friends of the Earth (2008) [http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/briefings/mchnical_biolo_treatmnt.pdf Mechanical Biological Treatment Briefing], ''www.foe.co.uk''</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Energy|Environment|Renewable energy|Sustainable development}}\n{{div col|2}}\n*[[Anaerobic digestion]]\n*[[Composting]]\n*[[List of solid waste treatment technologies]]\n*[[Lubeck Waste Treatment Facility]]\n*[[Materials recovery facility]]\n*[[Renewable energy]]\n*[[Waste]]\n*[[Waste management]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{-}}\n\n==References==\n{{Format footnotes|date=October 2012}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.waste-to-resources.eu/ Waste-to-Resources] World's largest conference on mechanical biological treatment (MBT) of municipal solid waste (MSW) and material recovery facilities (MRF)\n*[http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/wtd Environment Agency Waste Technology Data Centre] An independent UK government review of advanced waste treatment technologies.\n*Kuehle-Weidemeier et al.
