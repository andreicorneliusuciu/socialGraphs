One of the earliest definitions of collaborative software is \"intentional group processes plus software to support them\".<ref name=\"Johnson-Lenz\">{{cite web|last=Johnson-Lenz|first=Peter|title=Rhythms, Boundaries, and Containers|url=http://nexus.awakentech.com:8080/at/awaken1.nsf/UNIDs/CFB70C1957A686E98825654000699E1B?OpenDocument|publisher=Awakening Technology|date=30 April 1990}}</ref>\n\nCollaborative software is a broad concept that overlaps considerably with [[computer-supported cooperative work]] (CSCW). According to Carstensen and Schmidt (1999)<ref>{{cite web |last1=Carstensen |first1=P.H.|last2= Schmidt|first2= K. |year=1999 |title= Computer supported cooperative work: new challenges to systems design |url= http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/carstensen99computer.html |publisher=Citeseer.ist.psu.edu |accessdate= 2007-08-03}}</ref> groupware is part of CSCW. The authors claim that CSCW, and thereby groupware, addresses \"how collaborative activities and their coordination can be supported by means of computer systems.\" Software products such as email, calendaring, [[text chat]], [[wiki]], and [[Enterprise bookmarking|bookmarking]] belong to this category whenever used for group work,{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} whereas the more general term [[social software]] applies to systems used outside the workplace, for example, [[online dating service]]s and [[social networking site]]s like [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]].\n\nThe use of collaborative software in the work space creates a [[collaborative working environment]] (CWE).\n\nFinally, collaborative software relates to the notion of [[collaborative work systems]], which are conceived as any form of human organization that emerges any time that collaboration takes place, whether it is formal or informal, intentional or unintentional.<ref>Beyerlein, M; Freedman, S.; McGee, G.; Moran, L.

In 1975, [[Will Crowther]] created [[Colossal Cave Adventure]] on a [[DEC PDP-10]] computer. As internet connections grew, so did the numbers of users and multi-user games. In 1978 [[Roy Trubshaw]], a student at Essex University in the United Kingdom, created the game MUD (Multi-User Dungeon).\n\nThe US Government began using truly collaborative applications in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=99362&dl=GUIDE&coll=GUIDE&CFID=107391064&CFTOKEN=53017578 |title=Learning from user experience with groupware |doi=10.1145/99332.99362 |publisher=Portal.acm.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-25}}</ref> One of the first robust applications was the Navy's Common Operational Modeling, Planning and Simulation Strategy (COMPASS).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.cwid.js.mil/public/CWIDFctShtSuccesses21Mar08.doc Heritage of Delivering Successful Warfighting Solutions]</ref> The COMPASS system allowed up to 6 users created point-to-point connections with one another; the collaborative session only remained while at least one user stayed active, and would have to be recreated if all six logged out. MITRE improved on that model by hosting the collaborative session on a server that each user logged into. Called the Collaborative Virtual Workstation (CVW), this allowed the session to be set up in a virtual file cabinet and virtual rooms, and left as a persistent session that could be joined later.<ref>[http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark_Maybury/publication/220423771_Expert_Finding_for_Collaborative_Virtual_Environments/links/00b495295de7a430ec000000.pdf?disableCoverPage=true Collaborative virtual environments for analysis and decision support], Mark Mayburry</ref>\n\nIn 1996, [[Pavel Curtis]], who had built MUDs at [[PARC (company)|PARC]], created PlaceWare, a server that simulated a one-to-many auditorium, with side chat between \"seat-mates\", and the ability to invite a limited number of audience members to speak. In 1997, engineers at [[GTE]] used the PlaceWare engine in a commercial version of MITRE's CVW, calling it InfoWorkSpace (IWS). In 1998, IWS was chosen as the military standard for the standardized Air Operations Center.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ezenia.com/news/infoworkspace-saves-lives-in-iraq/|title = (Press Release)  InfoWorkSpace saves lives in Iraq - Ezenia!, Inc|publisher = Ezenia.com|date = |accessdate = 2014-06-25}}</ref> The IWS product was sold to [[General Dynamics]] and then later to Ezenia.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ezenia.com/products/products-infoworkspace/|title = (Press Release)  InfoWorkSpace - Ezenia!, Inc|publisher = Ezenia.com|date = |accessdate = 2014-06-25}}</ref>\n\n==Groupware==\nCollaborative software was originally designated as ''groupware'' and this term can be traced as far back as the late 1980s, when Richman and Slovak (1987)<ref>{{cite web |last1=Richman|first1= Louis S |last2= Slovak |first2=Julianne |date=June 8, 1987 |title= SOFTWARE CATCHES THE TEAM SPIRIT New computer programs may soon change the way groups of people work together -- and start delivering the long-awaited payoff from office automation.fouttoune |publisher=Money.cnn.com |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1987/06/08/69109/index.htm}}</ref> wrote:\n\n{{quote|\"Like an electronic sinew that binds teams together, the new ''groupware'' aims to place the computer squarely in the middle of communications among managers, technicians, and anyone else who interacts in groups, revolutionizing the way they work.\"}}\n\nEven further back, in 1978 Peter and Trudy Johnson-Lenz coined the term groupware; their initial 1978  definition of groupware was, \u201cintentional group processes plus software to support them.\u201d Later in their article they went on to explain groupware as \u201ccomputer-mediated culture... an embodiment of social organization in hyperspace.\" Groupware integrates co-evolving human and tool systems, yet is simply a single system.<ref name=\"Johnson-Lenz\"/>\n\nIn the early 1990s the first commercial groupware products were delivered, and big companies such as [[Boeing]] and [[IBM]] started using electronic meeting systems for key internal projects. [[IBM Lotus Notes|Lotus Notes]] appeared as a major example of that product category, allowing remote group collaboration when the internet was still in its infancy. Kirkpatrick and Losee (1992)<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kirkpatrick |first1=D. |last2=Losee |first2=S. |date=March 23, 1992 |title= HERE COMES THE PAYOFF FROM PCs New network software lets brainstormers around a table all ''talk'' at once on their keyboards.

You will be able to work efficiently as a member of a group wherever you have your computer. As computers become smaller and more powerful, that will mean anywhere.\"}}\n\n===Design and implementation issues===\nThe complexity of groupware development is still an issue. One reason for this is the socio-technical dimension of groupware. Groupware designers do not only have to address technical issues (as in traditional software development) but also consider the organizational aspects <ref>D'Atri A., De Marco M., Casalino N. (2008). \u201cInterdisciplinary Aspects of Information Systems Studies\u201d, pp. 1-416, Physica-Verlag, Springer, Germany, Doi 10.1007/978-3-7908-2010-2  ISBN 978-3-7908-2009-6.</ref> and the social group processes that should be supported with the groupware application. Some examples for issues in groupware development are:\n\n*Persistence is needed in some sessions. Chat and voice communications are routinely non-persistent and evaporate at the end of the session. Virtual room and online file cabinets can persist for years. The designer of the collaborative space needs to consider the information duration needs and implement accordingly.\n*Authentication has always been a problem with groupware. When connections are made point-to-point, or when log-in registration is enforced, it's clear who is engaged in the session. However, audio and unmoderated sessions carry the risk of unannounced 'lurkers' who observe but do not announce themselves or contribute.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130605033257/http://www.mitre.org/news/the_edge/june_98/transfer.html A Case Study in Technology Transfer of Collaboration Tools]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130912234901/http://www.mitre.org/news/the_edge/june_98/second.html Collaborating securely - Can it be done?]</ref>\n*Until recently, bandwidth issues at fixed location limited full use of the tools. These are exacerbated with mobile devices.\n*Multiple input and output streams bring concurrency issues into the groupware applications.\n*Motivational issues are important, especially in settings where no pre-defined group process was in place.\n*Closely related to the motivation aspect is the question of reciprocity.

Patterns for Computer-Mediated Interaction (Wiley Software Patterns Series). John Wiley & Sons. ISBN 978-0-470-02561-1</ref> The patterns identify recurring groupware design issues and discuss design choices in a way that all stakeholders can participate in the groupware development process.\n\n==Groupware and levels of collaboration==\nGroupware can be divided into three categories depending on the level of [[collaboration]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intranetjournal.com/faq/lotusbible.html |title=Groupware - Communication, Collaboration and Coordination |publisher=Lotus Development Corporation |date= |year=1995 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713051554/http://www.intranetjournal.com/faq/lotusbible.html |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}</ref><ref>Casalino N., Draoli M.

A phone call or an [[Instant Messaging|IM]] Chat discussion are examples of this.\n# '''Conferencing''' (or collaboration level, as it is called in the academic papers that discuss these levels) refers to interactive work toward a shared goal. Brainstorming or voting are examples of this.\n# '''Co-ordination''' refers to complex interdependent work toward a shared goal. A good metaphor for understanding this is to think about a sports team; everyone has to contribute the right play at the right time as well as adjust their play to the unfolding situation - but everyone is doing something different - in order for the team to win. That is complex interdependent work toward a shared goal: collaborative management.\n\n===Collaborative management (coordination) tools===\nCollaborative management tools facilitate and manage group activities. Examples include:\n* [[Electronic calendar]]s (also called [[time management]] software) &mdash; schedule events and automatically notify and remind group members\n* [[Project management]] systems &mdash; schedule, track, and chart the steps in a project as it is being completed\n* [[Online proofing]] &mdash; share, review, approve, and reject web proofs, artwork, photos, or videos between designers, customers, and clients\n* [[Workflow system]]s &mdash; collaborative management of tasks and documents within a knowledge-based business process\n* [[Knowledge management software|Knowledge management systems]] &mdash; collect, organize, manage, and share various forms of information\n* [[Enterprise bookmarking]] &mdash; collaborative bookmarking engine to tag, organize, share, and search enterprise data\n* [[Prediction market]]s &mdash; let a group of people predict together the outcome of future events\n* [[Extranet]] systems (sometimes also known as 'project extranets') &mdash; collect, organize, manage and share information associated with the delivery of a project (e.g.: the construction of a building)\n* [[Intranet]] systems &mdash; team members and clients can create online documents and collaborate on projects securely{{cn|date=November 2016}}\n* [[Social software]] systems &mdash; organize social relations of groups\n* [[Online spreadsheet]]s &mdash; collaborate and share structured data and information\n* [[Client portal]]s &mdash; interact and share with your clients in a private online environment{{cn|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Collaborative software and human interaction==\nThe design intent of collaborative software (groupware) is to transform the way documents and [[rich media]] are shared in order to enable more effective team collaboration.\n\nCollaboration, with respect to information technology, seems to have several definitions. Some are defensible but others are so broad they lose any meaningful application. Understanding the differences in human interactions is necessary to ensure the appropriate technologies are employed to meet interaction needs.\n\nThere are three primary ways in which humans interact: conversations, transactions, and collaborations.\n\n''Conversational interaction'' is an exchange of information between two or more participants where the primary purpose of the interaction is discovery or relationship building. There is no central entity around which the interaction revolves but is a free exchange of information with no defined constraints generally focused on personal experiences.<ref name=\"iSchool\">{{cite journal|last1=Dunbar|first1=R.
