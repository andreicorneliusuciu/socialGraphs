A lever is a rigid body capable of rotating on a point on itself. On the basis of the location of fulcrum, load and effort, the lever is divided into three types. It is one of the six [[simple machine]]s identified by Renaissance scientists. A lever amplifies an input force to provide a greater output force, which is said to provide '''leverage'''.  The ratio of the output force to the input force is the [[mechanical advantage]] of the lever.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"lever\" entered [[English language|English]] about 1300 from [[Old French]], in which the word was ''levier''. This sprang from the stem of the verb ''lever'', meaning \"to raise\". The verb, in turn, goes back to the [[Latin]] ''levare'', itself from the adjective ''levis'', meaning \"light\" (as in \"not heavy\"). The word's primary origin is the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) stem ''legwh-'', meaning \"light\", \"easy\" or \"nimble\", among other things. The PIE stem also gave rise to the English word \"light\".<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lever Etymology of the word \"lever\" in the Online Etymological Dictionary]</ref>\n\n==Early use==\nThe earliest remaining writings regarding levers date from the 3rd century BC and were provided by [[Archimedes]]. 'Give me a place to stand, and I shall move the Earth with it' is a remark of Archimedes who formally stated the correct mathematical principle of levers (quoted by [[Pappus of Alexandria]]). The distance required to do this might be exemplified in astronomical terms as the approximate distance to the Circinus galaxy (roughly 3.6 times the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy) - about 9 million light years. {{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}\n\nIt is assumed{{By whom|date=November 2015}} that in ancient Egypt, constructors used the lever to move and uplift obelisks weighing more than 100 tons.\n\n==Force and levers==\n[[File:Lever Principle 3D.png|thumb|right|A lever in balance]]\nA lever is a beam connected to ground by a hinge, or pivot, called a fulcrum. The ideal lever does not dissipate or store energy, which means there is no friction in the hinge or bending in the beam. In this case, the power into the lever equals the power out, and the ratio of output to input force is given by the ratio of the distances from the fulcrum to the points of application of these forces. This is known as the ''law of the lever.''\n\nThe mechanical advantage of a lever can be determined by considering the balance of [[Moment (physics)|moments]] or [[torque]], ''T'', about the fulcrum.\n\n:<math>T_{1} = F_{1}a,\\!</math>    <math>T_{2} = F_{2}b\\!</math> \n\nwhere F<sub>1</sub> is the input force to the lever and F<sub>2</sub> is the output force. The distances ''a'' and ''b'' are the perpendicular distances between the forces and the fulcrum.\n\nSince the moments of torque must be balanced, <math>T_{1} = T_{2} \\!</math> . So, <math>F_{1}a = F_{2}b \\!</math>.\n\nThe mechanical advantage of the lever is the ratio of output force to input force,\n\n:<math>MA = \\frac{F_{2}}{F_{1}}  = \\frac{a}{b}.\\!</math>\n\nThis relationship shows that the mechanical advantage can be computed from ratio of the distances from the fulcrum to where the input and output forces are applied to the lever, assuming no losses due to friction, flexibility or wear.\n\n==Classes of levers==\n[[File:Lever (PSF).png|thumb|right|Three classes of levers]]\nLevers are classified by the relative positions of the fulcrum, effort and resistance (or load).  It is common to call the input force ''the effort'' and the output force ''the load'' or ''the resistance.''  This allows the identification of three classes of levers by the relative locations of the fulcrum, the resistance and the effort:<ref>{{cite book\n  |title=Physics in Biology and Medicine, Third edition\n  |first1=Paul  |last1=Davidovits\n  |publisher=Academic Press\n  |year=2008\n  |isbn=978-0-12-369411-9\n  |page=10\n  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9hbt3xisb0C&pg=PA10 \n  |chapter=Chapter 1\n}}</ref>\n*'''{{visible anchor|Class 1}}''': Fulcrum in the middle: the effort is applied on one side of the fulcrum and the resistance (or load) on the other side, for example, a [[seesaw]], a [[crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] or a [[scissors|pair of scissors]]. Mechanical advantage may be greater than, less than, or equal to 1.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Class 2}}''': Resistance (or load) in the middle: the effort is applied on one side of the resistance and the fulcrum is located on the other side, for example, a [[wheelbarrow]], a [[nutcracker]], a [[bottle opener]] or the [[brake]] [[Automobile pedal|pedal]] of a car. Mechanical advantage is always greater than 1.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Class 3}}''': Effort in the middle: the resistance (or load) is on one side of the effort and the fulcrum is located on the other side, for example, a pair of [[tweezers]] or the [[human mandible]]. Mechanical advantage is always less than 1.\nThese cases are described by the mnemonic ''fre 123'' where the ''f''{{px2}}ulcrum is in the middle for the 1st class lever, the ''r''{{px2}}esistance is in the middle for the 2nd class lever, and the ''e''{{px1}}ffort is in the middle for the 3rd class lever.\n\n==Law of the lever==\nThe lever is a movable bar that pivots on a fulcrum attached to a fixed point. The lever operates by applying forces at different distances from the fulcrum, or a pivot.\n\nAssuming the lever does not dissipate or store energy, the [[power (physics)|power]] into the lever must equal the power out of the lever.  As the lever rotates around the fulcrum, points farther from this pivot move faster than points closer to the pivot.  Therefore, a force applied to a point farther from the pivot must be less than the force located at a point closer in, because power is the product of force and velocity.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Uicker\n  | first = John\n  | last2 = Pennock\n  | first2 = Gordon\n  | last3 = Shigley\n  | first3 = Joseph\n  | title = Theory of Machines and Mechanisms\n  | publisher = Oxford University Press, USA\n  | edition = 4th\n  | year = 2010\n  | isbn =978-0-19-537123-9 \n}}</ref>\n\nIf ''a'' and ''b'' are distances from the fulcrum to points ''A'' and ''B'' and the force ''F<sub>A</sub>'' applied to ''A'' is the input and the force ''F<sub>B</sub>'' applied at ''B'' is the output, the  ratio of the velocities of points ''A'' and ''B'' is given by ''a/b'', so we have the ratio of the output force to the input force, or mechanical advantage, is given by\n:<math>MA = \\frac{F_B}{F_A} = \\frac{a}{b}.</math>\n\nThis is the ''law of the lever'', which was proven by [[Archimedes]] using geometric reasoning.<ref name=\"Usher1954\">{{cite book|author=Usher, A.

On the other hand, if the distance ''a'' from the fulcrum to the input force is less than the distance ''b'' from the fulcrum to the output force, then the lever reduces the input force.\n\nThe use of velocity in the static analysis of a lever is an application of the principle of [[virtual work#Law of the Lever|virtual work]].\n\n==Virtual work and the law of the lever ==\nA lever is modeled as a rigid bar connected to a ground frame by a hinged joint called a fulcrum.  The lever is operated by applying an input force  '''F'''<sub>''A''</sub> at a point ''A'' located by the coordinate vector '''r'''<sub>''A''</sub> on the bar.  The lever then exerts an output force '''F'''<sub>''B''</sub> at the point ''B'' located by '''r'''<sub>''B''</sub>.   The rotation of the lever about the fulcrum ''P'' is defined by the rotation angle ''\u03b8'' in radians.\n[[Image:Archimedes lever (Small).jpg|thumb|right|This is an engraving from ''Mechanics Magazine'' published in London in 1824.]]\n\nLet the coordinate vector of the point ''P'' that defines the fulcrum be '''r'''<sub>''P''</sub>, and introduce the lengths \n:<math> a = |\\mathbf{r}_A -  \\mathbf{r}_P|, \\quad  b = |\\mathbf{r}_B -  \\mathbf{r}_P|, </math>\nwhich are the distances from the fulcrum to the input point ''A'' and to the output point ''B'', respectively.\n\nNow introduce the unit vectors '''e'''<sub>''A''</sub> and '''e'''<sub>''B''</sub> from the fulcrum to the point ''A'' and ''B'', so\n:<math> \\mathbf{r}_A  -  \\mathbf{r}_P = a\\mathbf{e}_A, \\quad \\mathbf{r}_B -  \\mathbf{r}_P = b\\mathbf{e}_B.</math>\nThe velocity of the points ''A'' and ''B'' are obtained as\n:<math> \\mathbf{v}_A = \\dot{\\theta} a \\mathbf{e}_A^\\perp, \\quad  \\mathbf{v}_B = \\dot{\\theta} b \\mathbf{e}_B^\\perp,</math>\nwhere '''e'''<sub>''A''</sub><sup>\u22a5</sup> and '''e'''<sub>''B''</sub><sup>\u22a5</sup> are unit vectors perpendicular to '''e'''<sub>''A''</sub> and '''e'''<sub>''B''</sub>, respectively.\n\nThe angle ''\u03b8'' is the [[generalized coordinate]] that defines the configuration of the lever, and the [[generalized force]] associated with this coordinate is given by\n:<math> F_\\theta =  \\mathbf{F}_A \\cdot \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{v}_A}{\\partial\\dot{\\theta}} - \\mathbf{F}_B \\cdot \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{v}_B}{\\partial\\dot{\\theta}}= a(\\mathbf{F}_A \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_A^\\perp) - b(\\mathbf{F}_B \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_B^\\perp) = a F_A - b F_B ,</math>\nwhere ''F''<sub>''A''</sub> and ''F''<sub>''B''</sub> are components of the forces that are perpendicular to the radial segments ''PA'' and ''PB''.   The principle of [[virtual work]] states that at equilibrium the generalized force is zero, that is\n:<math> F_\\theta = a F_A - b F_B = 0. \\,\\!</math>\n\nThus, the ratio of the output force ''F''<sub>''B''</sub> to the input force ''F''<sub>''A''</sub> is obtained as\n:<math> MA = \\frac{F_B}{F_A} = \\frac{a}{b},</math>\nwhich is the [[mechanical advantage]] of the lever.\n\nThis equation shows that if the distance ''a'' from the fulcrum to the point ''A'' where the input force is applied is greater than the distance ''b'' from fulcrum to the point ''B'' where the output force is applied, then the lever amplifies the input force.  If the opposite is true that the distance from the fulcrum to the input point ''A'' is less than from the fulcrum to the output point ''B'', then the lever reduces the magnitude of the input force.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|3}}\n* [[Applied mechanics]]\n* [[Crowbar (tool)]]\n* [[Heavy equipment]]\n* [[Linkage (mechanical)]]\n* [[Mechanical advantage]]\n* [[Mechanism (engineering)]]\n* [[Simple machine]]\n* [[Tipping point (physics)]]\n* [[Tool]]s\n* [[Virtual work]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Levers}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n*[http://www.diracdelta.co.uk/science/source/l/e/lever/source.html Lever] at Diracdelta science and engineering encyclopedia\n* ''[http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ASimpleLever/ A Simple Lever]'' by [[Stephen Wolfram]], [[Wolfram Demonstrations Project]].\n* [http://www.enchantedlearning.com/physics/machines/Levers.shtml Levers: Simple Machines] at EnchantedLearning.com\n\n{{Simple machines}}\n\n[[Category:Mechanisms (engineering)]]\n[[Category:Simple machines]]"}]}}}}
