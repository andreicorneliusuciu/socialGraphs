Surfaces of Revolution|LCCN=68015472|page=378}}</ref>\n\nExamples of surfaces of revolution generated by a straight line are [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] and [[conical surface]]s depending on whether or not the line is parallel to the axis. A circle that is rotated about any diameter generates a sphere of which it is then a [[great circle]], and if the circle is rotated about an axis that does not intersect the interior of a circle, then it generates a [[torus]] which does not intersect itself (a [[ring torus]]).\n\n==Properties==\nThe sections of the surface of revolution made by planes through the axis are called ''meridional sections''. Any meridional section can be considered to be the generatrix in the plane determined by it and the axis.<ref>{{citation|first1=W.A.|last1=Wilson|first2=J.I.|last2=Tracey|title=Analytic Geometry|edition=Revised|year=1925|publisher=D.C. Heath and Co.|page=227}}</ref>\n\nThe sections of the surface of revolution made by planes that are perpendicular to the axis are circles.\n\nSome special cases of [[hyperboloids]] (of either one or two sheets) and [[elliptic paraboloid]]s are surfaces of revolution. These may be identified as those quadratic surfaces all of whose [[Cross section (geometry)|cross sections]] perpendicular to the axis are circular.\n\n==Area formula==\nIf the curve is described by the [[parametric curve|parametric]] functions {{math|''x''(''t'')}}, {{math|''y''(''t'')}}, with {{mvar|t}} ranging over some interval {{math|[''a'',''b'']}}, and the axis of revolution is the {{mvar|y}}-axis, then the area {{mvar|A<sub>y</sub>}} is given by the [[integral]]\n\n:<math> A_y = 2 \\pi \\int_a^b x(t) \\, \\sqrt{\\left({dx \\over dt}\\right)^2 + \\left({dy \\over dt}\\right)^2} \\, dt, </math>\n\nprovided that {{math|''x''(''t'')}} is never negative between the endpoints {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}.

The quantity {{math|2\u03c0''x''(''t'')}} is the path of (the centroid of) this small segment, as required by Pappus' theorem.\n\nLikewise, when the axis of rotation is the {{mvar|x}}-axis and provided that {{math|''y''(''t'')}} is never negative, the area is given by<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Engineering Mathematics\n|edition=6\n|author=Singh\n|first=R.R.\n|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill\n|year=1993\n|isbn=0-07-014615-2\n|page=6.90\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oQ1y1HCpeowC&pg=SA6-PA90}}</ref>\n:<math> A_x = 2 \\pi \\int_a^b y(t) \\, \\sqrt{\\left({dx \\over dt}\\right)^2 + \\left({dy \\over dt}\\right)^2} \\, dt. </math>\n\nIf the curve is described by the function {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}}, {{math|''a'' \u2264 ''x'' \u2264 ''b''}}, then the integral becomes\n\n:<math>A_x = 2\\pi\\int_a^b y \\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2} \\, dx = 2\\pi\\int_a^bf(x)\\sqrt{1+\\big(f'(x)\\big)^2} \\, dx</math>\n\nfor revolution around the {{mvar|x}}-axis, and\n\n:<math>A_y =2\\pi\\int_a^b x \\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{dx}{dy}\\right)^2} \\, dy</math>\n\nfor revolution around the ''y''-axis (using {{math|''a'' \u2264 ''y'' \u2264 ''b''}}). These come from the above formula.\n\nFor example, the [[sphere|spherical surface]] with unit radius is generated by the curve {{math|1=''y''(''t'') = sin(''t'')}}, {{math|1=''x''(''t'') = cos(''t'')}}, when {{mvar|t}} ranges over {{math|[0,\u03c0]}}.

For example, to rotate a function {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} around the {{mvar|x}}-axis starting from the top of the {{mvar|xz}}-plane, parameterize it as\n:<math>\\vec r(u,v)=\\langle u,f(u)\\sin v,f(u)\\cos v\\rangle</math>\nfor {{math|1=''u'' = ''x''}} and {{math|''v'' \u2208 [0,2\u03c0]}}.\n\n==Geodesics on a surface of revolution==\nGeodesics on a surface of revolution are governed by [[Clairaut's relation]].\n\n==Toroids==\n{{main article|Toroid}}\n[[File:Toroid by Zureks.svg|thumb|A toroid generated from a square]]\nA surface of revolution with a hole in, where the axis of revolution does not intersect the surface, is called a toroid.<ref>{{MathWorld|Toroid|Toroid}}</ref> For example, when a rectangle is rotated around an axis parallel to one of its edges, then a hollow square-section ring is produced. If the revolved figure is a [[circle]], then the object is called a [[torus]].\n\n==Applications of surfaces of revolution==\nThe use of surfaces of revolution is essential in many fields in physics and engineering. When certain objects are designed digitally, revolutions like these can be used to determine surface area without the use of measuring the length and radius of the object being designed.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Channel surface]], a generalisation of a surface of revolution\n* [[Gabriel's Horn]]\n* [[Liouville surface]], another generalization of a surface of revolution\n* [[Solid of revolution]]\n* [[Surface integral]]\n* [[Generalized helicoid]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*{{MathWorld|title=Surface of Revolution|urlname=SurfaceofRevolution}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.mathcurve.com/surfaces/revolution/revolution.shtml |title=Surface de r\u00e9volution |website=Encyclop\u00e9die des Formes Math\u00e9matiques Remarquables |language=French}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Surface Of Revolution}}\n[[Category:Integral calculus]]\n[[Category:Surfaces]]"}]}}}}
