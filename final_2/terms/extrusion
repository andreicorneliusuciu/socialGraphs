A material is pushed through a [[Die (manufacturing)|die]] of the desired cross-section. The two main advantages of this process over other manufacturing processes are its ability to create very complex cross-sections, and to work materials that are brittle, because the material only encounters [[compressive stress|compressive]] and [[shear stress|shear]] stresses. It also forms parts with an excellent surface finish.<ref name=mh>{{harvnb|Oberg|Jones|Horton|Ryffel|2000|pp=1348\u20131349}}</ref>\n\n[[Drawing (manufacturing)|Drawing]] is a similar process, which uses the tensile strength of the material to pull it through the die.  This limits the amount of change which can be performed in one step, so it is limited to simpler shapes, and multiple stages are usually needed.  Drawing is the main way to produce [[wire]].  Metal [[Bar stock|bar]] and [[tube (fluid conveyance)|tube]] are also often drawn.\n\nExtrusion may be continuous (theoretically producing indefinitely long material) or semi-continuous (producing many pieces). The extrusion process can be done with the material hot or cold.  Commonly extruded materials include [[metal]]s, [[polymer]]s, [[ceramic]]s, [[concrete]], play dough, and foodstuffs. The products of extrusion are generally called \"extrudates\".\n\nHollow cavities within extruded material cannot be produced using a simple flat extrusion die, because there would be no way to support the centre barrier of the die. Instead, the die assumes the shape of a block with depth, beginning first with a shape profile that supports the center section. The die shape then internally changes along its length into the final shape, with the suspended center pieces supported from the back of the die.  The material flows around the supports and fuses together to create the desired closed shape.\n\nThe extrusion process in metals may also increase the strength of the material.\n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2016}}\nIn 1797, [[Joseph Bramah]] patented the first extrusion process for making pipe out of soft metals. It involved preheating the metal and then forcing it through a die via a hand-driven plunger. In 1820 Thomas Burr implemented that process for lead pipe, with a [[hydraulic press]] (also invented by Joseph Bramah). At that time the process was called \"squirting\". In 1894, Alexander Dick expanded the extrusion process to copper and brass alloys.<ref name=tmeh11>{{harvnb|Backus|Boshold|Johannisson|Noble|1998|pp=13-11\u201312|loc=Hot extrusion}}</ref>\n\n==Process==\n[[Image:Extrusion.JPG|frame|Extrusion of a round blank through a die.]]\nThe process begins by heating the stock material (for hot or warm extrusion). It is then loaded into the container in the press. A dummy block is placed behind it where the ram then presses on the material to push it out of the die. Afterward the extrusion is stretched in order to straighten it. If better properties are required then it may be [[heat treat]]ed or [[cold work]]ed.<ref name=tmeh11/>\n\nThe extrusion ratio is defined as the starting cross-sectional area divided by the cross-sectional area of the final extrusion. One of the main advantages of the extrusion process is that this ratio can be very large while still producing quality parts.\n\n===Hot extrusion===\nHot extrusion is a [[hot working]] process, which means it is done above the material's [[recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallization]] temperature to keep the material from [[work hardening]] and to make it easier to push the material through the die. Most hot extrusions are done on horizontal [[hydraulic press]]es that range from {{convert|230|to|11000|metric ton|short ton}}. Pressures range from {{convert|30|to|700|MPa|psi|abbr=on}}, therefore lubrication is required, which can be oil or graphite for lower temperature extrusions, or glass powder for higher temperature extrusions. The biggest disadvantage of this process is its cost for machinery and its upkeep.<ref name=mh/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:400px;\"wocao\n|+ Hot extrusion temperature for various metals<ref name=mh/>\n|-\n!

There is a crossover point where [[roll forming]] becomes more economical. For instance, some steels become more economical to roll if producing more than 20,000&nbsp;kg (50,000&nbsp;lb).<ref name=tmeh11/>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Aluminium hot extrusion die\">\nImage:Aluminium extrusion die front.png|Front side of a four family die.

Notice that the walls are drafted and that the back wall thickness varies.\nImage:Aluminium extrusion die back.png|Back side of die. The wall thickness of the extrusion is {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}}.\n</gallery>\n\n===Cold extrusion===\nCold extrusion is done at room temperature or near room temperature. The advantages of this over hot extrusion are the lack of oxidation, higher strength due to [[cold working]], closer tolerances, better surface finish, and fast extrusion speeds if the material is subject to [[Red-short|hot shortness]].<ref name=mh/>\n\nMaterials that are commonly cold extruded include: [[lead]], [[tin]], [[aluminum]], [[copper]], [[zirconium]], [[titanium]], [[molybdenum]], [[beryllium]], [[vanadium]], [[niobium]], and [[steel]].\n\nExamples of products produced by this process are: collapsible tubes, [[fire extinguisher]] cases, [[shock absorber]] cylinders and [[gear]] blanks.\n\n===Warm extrusion===\nWarm extrusion is done above room temperature, but below the recrystallization temperature of the material the temperatures ranges from 800 to 1800&nbsp;\u00b0F (424 to 975&nbsp;\u00b0C). It is usually used to achieve the proper balance of required forces, ductility and final extrusion properties.<ref name=mf/>\n\n===Microextrusion===\n{{main article|Microextrusion}}\nMicroextrusion is a [[Microfabrication#Microforming|microforming]] extrusion process performed at the submillimeter range. Like extrusion, metal is pushed through a die orifice, but the resulting product's cross section can fit through a 1mm square. Several microextrusion processes have been developed since microforming was envisioned in 1990.<ref name=\"EngelMicro02\">{{cite journal |title=Microforming - From Basic research to its realization |journal=Journal of Materials Processing Technology |author1=Engel, U. |author2=Eckstein, R. |volume=125\u2013126 |issue=2002 |pages=35\u201344 |year=2002 |doi=10.1016/S0924-0136(02)00415-6}}</ref><ref name=\"DixitMicro12\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYlJbKw_azEC&pg=PA264 |chapter=Chapter 15: Microextrusion |title=Micromanufacturing Processes |author1=Dixit, U.S. |author2=Das, R. |editor=Jain, V.K. |publisher=CRC Press |pages=263\u2013282 |year=2012 |isbn=9781439852903}}</ref><ref name=\"FuARev13\">{{cite journal |title=A review on the state-of-the-art microforming technologies |journal=International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology |author1=Fu, M.W. |author2=Chan, W.L. |volume=67 |issue=9 |pages=2411\u20132437 |year=2013 |doi=10.1007/s00170-012-4661-7}}</ref> Forward (ram and [[Semi-finished casting products#Billet|billet]] move in the same direction) and backward (ram and billet move in the opposite direction) microextrusion were first introduced, with forward rod-backward cup and double cup extrusion methods developing later.<ref name=\"DixitMicro12\" /><ref name=\"FuMicro14\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yie_BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA100 |chapter=Chapter 4: Microforming Processes |title=Micro-scaled Products Development via Microforming: Deformation Behaviours, Processes, Tooling and its Realization |author1=Fu, M.W. |author2=Chan, W.L. |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |pages=73\u2013130 |year=2014 |isbn=9781447163268 |accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref> Regardless of method, one of the greatest challenges of creating a successful microextrusion machine is the manufacture of the die and ram. \"The small size of the die and ram, along with the stringent accuracy requirement, needs suitable manufacturing processes.\"<ref name=\"DixitMicro12\" /> Additionally, as Fu and Chan pointed out in a 2013 state-of-the-art technology review, several issues must still be resolved before microextrusion and other microforming technologies can be implemented more widely, including [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation load and defects]], forming system stability, mechanical properties, and other size-related effects on the [[crystallite]] (grain) structure and boundaries.<ref name=\"DixitMicro12\" /><ref name=\"FuARev13\" />\n\n===Extrusion defects===\n*Surface cracking occurs when the surface of an extrusion splits.  This is often caused by the extrusion temperature, friction, or speed being too high.  It can also happen at lower temperatures if the extruded product temporarily sticks to the die.\n*Pipe \u2013 A flow pattern that draws the surface oxides and impurities to the center of the product.  Such a pattern is often caused by high friction or cooling of the outer regions of the billet.\n*Internal cracking \u2013 When the center of the extrusion develops cracks or voids.  These cracks are attributed to a state of hydrostatic tensile stress at the centerline in the deformation zone in the die. (A similar situation to the necked region in a tensile stress specimen)\n*Surface lines \u2013 When there are lines visible on the surface of the extruded profile. This depends heavily on the quality of the die production and how well the die is maintained, as some residues of the material extruded can stick to the die surface and produce the embossed lines.\n\n==Equipment==\n[[image:Al extrusion machine with dies.jpg|thumb|A horizontal hydraulic press for hot aluminum extrusion (loose dies and scrap visible in foreground)]]\nThere are many different variations of extrusion equipment. They vary by four major characteristics:<ref name=mh/>\n\n# Movement of the extrusion with relation to the ram. If the die is held stationary and the ram moves towards it then it is called \"direct extrusion\". If the ram is held stationary and the die moves towards the ram it is called \"indirect extrusion\".\n# The position of the press, either vertical or horizontal.\n# The type of drive, either hydraulic or mechanical.\n# The type of load applied, either conventional (variable) or [[hydrostatic]].\n\nA single or twin screw auger, powered by an electric motor, or a ram, driven by hydraulic pressure (often used for steel and titanium alloys), oil pressure (for aluminium), or in other specialized processes such as rollers inside a perforated drum for the production of many simultaneous streams of material.\n\nTypical extrusion presses cost more than $100,000, whereas dies can cost up to $2000.\n\n===Forming internal cavities===\n[[Image:Al extrusion die set.jpg|thumb|left|Two-piece aluminum extrusion die set (parts shown separated.) The male part (at right) is for forming the internal cavity in the resulting round tube extrusion.]]\n\nThere are several methods for forming internal cavities in extrusions. One way is to use a hollow billet and then use a fixed or floating [[mandrel]]. A fixed mandrel, also known as a German type, means it is integrated into the dummy block and stem. A floating mandrel, also known as a French type, floats in slots in the dummy block and aligns itself in the die when extruding. If a solid billet is used as the feed material then it must first be pierced by the mandrel before extruding through the die. A special press is used in order to control the mandrel independently from the ram.<ref name=mh/> The solid billet could also be used with a spider die, porthole die or bridge die. All of these types of dies incorporate the mandrel in the die and have \"legs\" that hold the mandrel in place. During extrusion the metal divides, flows around the legs, then merges, leaving weld lines in the final product.<ref>{{harvnb|Backus|Boshold|Johannisson|Noble|1998|pp=13\u201321|loc=Hot extrusion: Tooling}}</ref>\n\n===Direct extrusion===\n[[Image:Extrusion force plot.png|thumb|300px|Plot of forces required by various extrusion processes.]]\n\nDirect extrusion, also known as forward extrusion, is the most common extrusion process. It works by placing the billet in a heavy walled container. The billet is pushed through the die by a ram or screw. There is a reusable dummy block between the ram and the billet to keep them separated. The major disadvantage of this process is that the force required to extrude the billet is greater than that needed in the indirect extrusion process because of the [[friction]]al forces introduced by the need for the billet to travel the entire length of the container. Because of this the greatest force required is at the beginning of process and slowly decreases as the billet is used up. At the end of the billet the force greatly increases because the billet is thin and the material must flow radially to exit the die. The end of the billet (called the butt end) is not used for this reason.<ref name=tmeh13>{{harvnb|Backus|Boshold|Johannisson|Noble|1998|p=13-13|loc=Hot extrusion: Methods of extruding: Direct extrusion}}</ref>\n\n===Indirect extrusion===\nIn indirect extrusion, also known as backwards extrusion, the billet and container move together while the die is stationary. The die is held in place by a \"stem\" which has to be longer than the container length. The maximum length of the extrusion is ultimately dictated by the [[column]] strength of the stem. Because the billet moves with the container the frictional forces are eliminated. This leads to the following advantages:<ref name=tmeh14>{{harvnb|Backus|Boshold|Johannisson|Noble|1998|pp=13\u201314}}</ref>\n*A 25 to 30% reduction of friction, which allows for extruding larger billets, increasing speed, and an increased ability to extrude smaller cross-sections\n*There is less of a tendency for extrusions to crack because there is no heat formed from friction\n*The container liner will last longer due to less wear\n*The billet is used more uniformly so extrusion defects and coarse grained peripherals zones are less likely.\n\nThe disadvantages are:<ref name=tmeh14/>\n*Impurities and defects on the surface of the billet affect the surface of the extrusion. These defects ruin the piece if it needs to be [[anodize]]d or the aesthetics are important. In order to get around this the billets may be wire brushed, machined or chemically cleaned before being used.\n*This process isn't as versatile as direct extrusions because the cross-sectional area is limited by the maximum size of the stem.\n\n===Hydrostatic extrusion===\nIn the hydrostatic extrusion process the billet is completely surrounded by a pressurized liquid, except where the billet contacts the die. This process can be done hot, warm, or cold, however the temperature is limited by the stability of the fluid used. The process must be carried out in a sealed cylinder to contain the hydrostatic medium. The fluid can be pressurized two ways:<ref name=tmeh14/>\n\n#''Constant-rate extrusion'': A ram or plunger is used to pressurize the fluid inside the container.\n#''Constant-pressure extrusion'': A pump is used, possibly with a [[hydraulic intensifier|pressure intensifier]], to pressurize the fluid, which is then pumped to the container.\n\nThe advantages of this process include:<ref name=tmeh14/>\n\n*No friction between the container and the billet reduces force requirements. This ultimately allows for faster speeds, higher reduction ratios, and lower billet temperatures.\n*Usually the ductility of the material increases when high pressures are applied.\n*An even flow of material.\n*Large billets and large cross-sections can be extruded.\n*No billet residue is left on the container walls.\n\nThe disadvantages are:<ref name=tmeh14/>\n\n*The billets must be prepared by tapering one end to match the die entry angle. This is needed to form a seal at the beginning of the cycle. Usually the entire billet needs to be machined to remove any surface defects.\n*Containing the fluid under high pressures can be difficult.\n*A billet remnant or a plug of a tougher material must be left at the end of the extrusion to prevent a sudden release of the extrusion fluid.\n\n===Drives===\nMost modern direct or indirect extrusion presses are hydraulically driven, but there are some small mechanical presses still used. Of the hydraulic presses there are two types: direct-drive oil presses and accumulator water drives.\n\nDirect-drive oil presses are the most common because they are reliable and robust. They can deliver over 35 MPa (5000 psi). They supply a constant pressure throughout the whole billet. The disadvantage is that they are slow, between 50 and 200&nbsp;mm/s (2\u20138 ips).<ref name=tmeh16>{{harvnb|Backus|Boshold|Johannisson|Noble|1998|pp=13\u201316}}</ref>\n\nAccumulator water drives are more expensive and larger than direct-drive oil presses, and they lose about 10% of their pressure over the stroke, but they are much faster, up to 380&nbsp;mm/s (15 ips). Because of this they are used when extruding steel. They are also used on materials that must be heated to very hot temperatures for safety reasons.<ref name=tmeh16/>\n\nHydrostatic extrusion presses usually use [[castor oil]] at pressure up to 1400 MPa (200 ksi). Castor oil is used because it has good lubricity and high pressure properties.<ref>{{harvnb|Backus|Boshold|Johannisson|Noble|1998|pp=13\u201320}}</ref>\n\n==Die  design==\nThe design of an extrusion profile has a large impact on how readily it can be extruded. The maximum size for an extrusion is determined by finding the smallest circle that will fit around the cross-section, this is called the ''circumscribing circle''. This diameter, in turn, controls the size of the die required, which ultimately determines if the part will fit in a given press. For example, a larger press can handle {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}} diameter circumscribing circles for aluminium and 55&nbsp;cm (22&nbsp;in) diameter circles for steel and titanium.<ref name=mh/>\n\nThe complexity of an extruded profile can be roughly quantified by calculating the ''shape factor'', which is the amount of surface area generated per unit mass of extrusion. This affects the cost of tooling as well as the rate of production.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100424003904/http://www.makeitfrom.com/info/?about=Aluminum_Extrusion_Tooling Aluminum Extrusion Tooling \u2013 MakeItFrom]</ref>\n\nThicker sections generally need an increased section size. In order for the material to flow properly legs should not be more than ten times longer than their thickness. If the cross-section is asymmetrical, adjacent sections should be as close to the same size as possible. Sharp corners should be avoided; for aluminium and magnesium the minimum radius should be 0.4&nbsp;mm (1/64&nbsp;in) and for steel corners should be {{convert|0.75|mm|abbr=on}} and [[fillet (mechanics)|fillet]]s should be {{convert|3|mm|abbr=on}}. The following table lists the minimum cross-section and thickness for various materials.<ref name=mh/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Material\n! Minimum cross-section [cm\u00b2 (sq. in.)]\n!

Aluminium can be hot or cold extruded. If it is hot extruded it is heated to 575 to 1100&nbsp;\u00b0F (300 to 600&nbsp;\u00b0C). Examples of products include [[profile (engineering)|profile]]s for tracks, frames, rails, [[mullions]], and [[heat sink]]s.\n* '''[[Brass]]''' is used to extrude corrosion free rods, automobile parts, pipe fittings, engineering parts.\n* '''[[Copper]]''' (1100 to 1825&nbsp;\u00b0F (600 to 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C)) pipe, wire, rods, bars, tubes, and welding electrodes.

The glass melts and forms a thin film, 20 to 30 [[thou (length)|mils]] (0.5 to 0.75&nbsp;mm), in order to separate it from chamber walls and allow it to act as a lubricant. A thick solid glass ring that is 0.25 to 0.75 in (6 to 18&nbsp;mm) thick is placed in the chamber on the die to lubricate the extrusion as it is forced through the die. A second advantage of this glass ring is its ability to insulate the heat of the billet from the die. The extrusion will have a 1 mil thick layer of glass, which can be easily removed once it cools.<ref name=mf>{{Citation |last=Avitzur |first=B. |contribution=Metal forming |year=1987 |title=Encyclopedia of Physical Science & Technology |volume=8 | pages=80\u2013109 |place=San Diego |publisher=Academic Press, Inc.}}</ref>\n\nAnother breakthrough in lubrication is the use of phosphate coatings. With this process, in conjunction with glass lubrication, steel can be cold extruded. The phosphate coat absorbs the liquid glass to offer even better lubricating properties.<ref name=mf/>\n\n===Plastic===\n[[Image:Extruder section.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Sectional view of a plastic extruder showing the components]]\n[[File:Caterpillar Haul-Off.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Sectional view of how a caterpillar haul-off provides line tension]]\n{{Main article|Plastics extrusion}}\n\n[[Plastics extrusion]] commonly uses plastic chips or pellets, which are usually dried, to drive out moisture, in a hopper before going to the feed screw. The polymer resin is heated to molten state by a combination of heating elements and shear heating from the extrusion screw.  The screw, or screws as the case with twin screw extrusion, forces the resin through a die, forming the resin into the desired shape. The extrudate is cooled and solidified as it is pulled through the die or water tank. A \"caterpillar haul-off\" (called a \"puller\" in the US) is used to provide tension on the extrusion line which is essential for overall quality of the extrudate. Pelletizers can also create this tension while pulling extruded strands in to be cut. The caterpillar haul-off must provide a consistent pull; otherwise, variation in cut lengths or distorted product will result.  In some cases (such as fibre-reinforced tubes) the extrudate is pulled through a very long die, in a process called \"pultrusion\". The configuration of the interior screws are a driving force dependent on the application. Mixing elements or convey elements are used in various formations. Extrusion is common in the application of adding colorant to molten plastic thus creating specific custom color.\n\nA multitude of polymers are used in the production of plastic tubing, pipes, rods, rails, seals, and sheets or films.\n\n===Ceramic===\nCeramic can also be formed into shapes via extrusion. [[Terracotta]] extrusion is used to produce pipes. Many modern bricks are also manufactured using a brick extrusion process.<ref>[http://www.umich.edu/~bricks/brickwebsite/setting_drying/setting_drying_intro.htm Brick manufacturing process]</ref> {403 forbidden link 12Jul15}\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Food===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}\n{{main article|Food extrusion}}\n[[File:Macaroni closeup.jpg|thumb|Elbow [[macaroni]] is an extruded hollow pasta.]]\nWith the advent of industrial manufacturing, extrusion found application in [[food processing]] of instant foods and snacks, along with its already known uses in plastics and metal fabrication.  Products such as certain [[pasta]]s, many [[breakfast cereal]]s, premade [[cookie dough]], some [[french fries]], certain [[baby food]]s, dry or semi-moist [[pet food]] and ready-to-eat snacks are mostly manufactured by extrusion. It is also used to produce [[modified starch]], and to pelletize [[Compound feed|animal feed]].\n\nGenerally, high-temperature extrusion is used for the manufacture of ready-to-eat snacks, while cold extrusion is used for the manufacture of pasta and related products intended for later cooking and consumption. The processed products have low moisture and hence considerably higher shelf life, and provide variety and convenience to consumers.\n  \nIn the extrusion process, raw materials are first ground to the correct particle size. The dry mix is passed through a pre-conditioner, in which other ingredients may be added, and [[steam]] is injected to start the cooking process. The preconditioned mix is then passed through an extruder, where it is forced through a die and cut to the desired length. The cooking process takes place within the extruder where the product produces its own friction and heat due to the pressure generated (10\u201320&nbsp;bar). The main independent parameters during extrusion cooking are feed rate, particle size of the raw material, barrel temperature, screw speed and moisture content. The extruding process can induce both [[protein denaturation]] and [[starch gelatinization]], depending on inputs and parameters. Sometimes, a catalyst is used, for example, when producing texturised vegetable proteins (TVP).\n\n===Drug carriers===\n{{Expand section|date=August 2008}}\nFor use in pharmaceutical products, extrusion through nano-porous, polymeric filters is being used to produce suspensions of lipid vesicles [[liposome]]s or [[transfersome]]s with a particular size of a narrow [[Dispersity|size distribution]]. The anti-cancer drug [[Doxorubicin]] in liposome delivery system is formulated by extrusion, for example. Hot melt extrusion is also utilized in pharmaceutical solid oral dose processing to enable delivery of drugs with poor solubility and bioavailability. Hot melt extrusion has been shown to molecularly disperse poorly soluble drugs in a polymer carrier increasing dissolution rates and bioavailability. The process involves the application of heat, pressure and agitation to mix materials together and \u2018extrude\u2019 them through a die. Twin-screw high shear extruders blend materials and simultaneously break up particles. The resulting particle can be blended with compression aids and compressed into tablets or filled into unit dose capsules.<ref>{{cite web|title=Extrusion Spheronisation|url=http://www.pharmacmc.com/extrusion-spheronisation/|website=PharmaCMC|accessdate=27 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Biomass briquettes===\n{{main article|Biomass briquettes}}\n\nThe extrusion production technology of fuel briquettes is the process of extrusion screw wastes (straw, sunflower husks, buckwheat, etc.) or finely shredded wood waste (sawdust) under high pressure when heated from 160 to 350&nbsp;\u00b0C. The resulting fuel [[briquette]]s do not include any of the binders, but one natural \u2013 the lignin contained in the cells of plant wastes. The temperature during compression causes melting of the surface of bricks, making it more solid, which is important for the transportation of briquettes.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Equal channel angular extrusion]]\n*[[Impact extrusion]]\n*[[Extrusion coating]]\n*[[Fused deposition modeling]]\n*[[3D printer extruder]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Cite book|last1= Backus |first1= Robert G. |last2= Boshold |first2= R.
