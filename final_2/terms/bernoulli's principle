(1967), Section 3.5, pp.&nbsp;156\u201364.</ref> The principle is named after [[Daniel Bernoulli]] who published it in his book ''[[Hydrodynamica]]'' in 1738.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/658890/Hydrodynamica#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&title=Hydrodynamica%20\u2013%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia | title=Hydrodynamica | accessdate=2008-10-30 |publisher= Britannica Online Encyclopedia }}</ref>\n\nBernoulli's principle can be applied to various types of fluid flow, resulting in various forms of '''Bernoulli's equation'''; there are different forms of Bernoulli's equation for different types of flow. The simple form of Bernoulli's equation is valid for [[incompressible flow]]s (e.g. most [[liquid]] flows and [[gas]]es moving at low [[Mach number]]). More advanced forms may  be applied to [[compressible flow]]s at higher [[Mach number]]s (see [[#Derivations of Bernoulli equation|the derivations of the Bernoulli equation]]). <!-- This was previously deleted and had to be restored. Please state the criteria for the use of Bernoulli's principle. If there are none, don't just delete it, state it or preferably explain it. -->\n\nBernoulli's principle can be derived from the principle of [[conservation of energy]]. This states that, in a steady flow, the sum of all forms of energy in a fluid along a [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamline]] is the same at all points on that streamline. This requires that the sum of [[kinetic energy]], [[potential energy]] and [[internal energy]] remains constant.<ref name=\"Batchelor_3.5\"/> Thus an increase in the speed of the fluid \u2013 implying an increase in  both its [[dynamic pressure]] and kinetic energy \u2013 occurs with a simultaneous decrease in (the sum of) its [[static pressure]], potential energy and internal energy. If the fluid is flowing out of a reservoir, the sum of all forms of energy is the same on all streamlines because in a reservoir the energy per unit volume (the sum of pressure and [[gravitational potential]] ''\u03c1&nbsp;g&nbsp;h'') is the same everywhere.<ref>Streeter, V.L., ''Fluid Mechanics'', Example&nbsp;3.5, McGraw\u2013Hill Inc. (1966), New York.</ref>\n\nBernoulli's principle can also be derived directly from [[Newton's 2nd law]].  If a small volume of fluid is flowing horizontally from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure, then there is more pressure behind than in front. This gives a net force on the volume, accelerating it along the streamline.<ref name=Babinsky>\"If the particle is in a region of varying pressure (a non-vanishing pressure gradient in the x-direction) and if the particle has a finite size l, then the front of the particle will be \u2018seeing\u2019 a different pressure from the rear. More precisely, if the pressure drops in the x-direction (dp/dx < 0) the pressure at the rear is higher than at the front and the particle experiences a (positive) net force. According to Newton\u2019s second law, this force causes an acceleration and the particle\u2019s velocity increases as it moves along the streamline... Bernoulli's equation describes this mathematically (see the complete derivation in the appendix).\"{{citation\n  | journal=Physics Education\n  | first=Holger\n  | last=Babinsky\n  |date=November 2003\n  | url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0031-9120/38/6/001/pe3_6_001.pdf\n  | title=How do wings work?\n  }}</ref><ref name=\"Weltner\">\"Acceleration of air is caused by pressure gradients.

Conversely if the parcel is moving into a region of lower pressure, there will be an higher pressure behind it (higher than the pressure ahead), speeding it up. As always, any unbalanced force will cause a change in momentum (and velocity), as required by Newton\u2019s laws of motion.\" ''See How It Flies'' John S. Denker http://www.av8n.com/how/htm/airfoils.html</ref>\n\nFluid particles are subject only to pressure and their own weight. If a fluid is flowing horizontally and along a section of a streamline, where the speed increases it can only be because the fluid on that section has moved from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure; and if its speed decreases, it can only be because it has moved from a region of lower pressure to a region of higher pressure. Consequently, within a fluid flowing horizontally, the highest speed occurs where the pressure is lowest, and the lowest speed occurs where the pressure is highest.<ref>Resnick, R. and Halliday, D. (1960), section 18-4, ''Physics'', John Wiley & Sons, Inc.</ref>\n\n== Incompressible flow equation ==<!-- [[total pressure]] and [[energy head]] redirect to here -->\nIn most flows of liquids, and of gases at low [[Mach number]], the [[density]] of a fluid parcel can be considered to be constant, regardless of pressure variations in the flow.  Therefore, the fluid can be considered to be incompressible and these flows are called incompressible flows. Bernoulli performed his experiments on liquids, so his equation in its original form is valid only for incompressible flow.\nA common form of Bernoulli's equation, valid at any arbitrary point along a [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamline]], is:\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>{v^2 \\over 2}+gz+{p\\over\\rho}=\\text{constant}</math>|{{EquationRef|A}}}}\n\nwhere:\n:<math>v\\,</math> is the fluid flow [[speed]] at a point on a streamline,\n:<math>g\\,</math> is the [[Earth's gravity|acceleration due to gravity]],\n:<math>z\\,</math> is the [[elevation]] of the point above a reference plane, with the positive ''z''-direction pointing upward \u2013 so in the direction opposite to the gravitational acceleration,\n:<math>p\\,</math> is the [[pressure]] at the chosen point, and\n:<math>\\rho\\,</math> is the [[density]] of the fluid at all points in the fluid.\n\nThe constant on the right-hand side of the equation depends only on the streamline chosen, whereas <math>v\\,</math>, <math>z\\,</math> and <math>p\\,</math> depend on the particular point on that streamline.\n\nThe following assumptions must be met for this Bernoulli equation to apply:<ref name=\"Batchelor_265\" />\n* the flow must be [[Fluid dynamics|steady]], i.e. the fluid velocity at a point cannot change with time,\n* the flow must be incompressible \u2013 even though pressure varies, the density must remain constant along a streamline;\n* friction by [[Viscosity|viscous]] forces has to be negligible.\n\nFor [[conservative force]] fields (not limited to the gravitational field), Bernoulli's equation can be generalized as:<ref name=\"Batchelor_265\">Batchelor, G.K.

A common approach is in terms of '''total head''' or '''energy head''' ''H'':\n\n:<math>H\\, =\\, z\\, +\\, \\frac{p}{\\rho g}\\, +\\, \\frac{v^2}{2\\,g}\\, =\\, h\\, +\\, \\frac{v^2}{2\\,g},</math>\n\nThe above equations suggest there is a flow speed at which pressure is zero, and at even higher speeds the pressure is negative. Most often, gases and liquids are not capable of negative absolute pressure, or even zero pressure, so clearly Bernoulli's equation ceases to be valid before zero pressure is reached. In liquids \u2013 when the pressure becomes too low \u2013 [[cavitation]] occurs. The above equations use a linear relationship between flow speed squared and pressure. At higher flow speeds in gases, or for [[sound]] waves in liquid, the changes in mass density become significant so that the assumption of constant density is invalid.\n\n=== Simplified form ===\nIn many applications of Bernoulli's equation, the change in the ''\u03c1''&nbsp;''g''&nbsp;''z'' term along the streamline is so small compared with the other terms that it can be ignored. For example, in the case of aircraft in flight, the change in height ''z'' along a streamline is so small the ''\u03c1''&nbsp;''g''&nbsp;''z'' term can be omitted.  This allows the above equation to be presented in the following simplified form:\n\n:<math>p + q = p_0\\,</math>\n\nwhere ''p''<sub>0</sub> is called 'total pressure', and ''q'' is '[[dynamic pressure]]'.<ref>{{cite web|title = Bernoulli's Equation| publisher = NASA Glenn Research Center| url =http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/bern.htm|accessdate = 2009-03-04 }}</ref>  Many authors refer to the [[pressure]] ''p'' as [[static pressure]] to distinguish it from total pressure ''p''<sub>0</sub> and [[dynamic pressure]] ''q''. In ''Aerodynamics'', L.J. Clancy writes: \"To distinguish it from the total and dynamic pressures, the actual pressure of the fluid, which is associated not with its motion but with its state, is often referred to as the static pressure, but where the term pressure alone is used it refers to this static pressure.\"<ref name=\"Clancy3.5\">Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 3.5.</ref>\n\nThe simplified form of Bernoulli's equation can be summarized in the following memorable word equation:\n:''static pressure + dynamic pressure = total pressure''<ref name=\"Clancy3.5\"/>\n\nEvery point in a steadily flowing fluid, regardless of the fluid speed at that point, has its own unique static pressure ''p'' and dynamic pressure ''q''. Their sum ''p''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''q'' is defined to be the total pressure ''p''<sub>0</sub>.  The significance of Bernoulli's principle can now be summarized as ''total pressure is constant along a streamline.''\n\nIf the fluid flow is [[irrotational flow|irrotational]], the total pressure on every streamline is the same and Bernoulli's principle can be summarized as ''total pressure is constant everywhere in the fluid flow.''<ref>Clancy, L.J. ''Aerodynamics'', Equation 3.12</ref> It is reasonable to assume that irrotational flow exists in any situation where a large body of fluid is flowing past a solid body.  Examples are aircraft in flight, and ships moving in open bodies of water.  However, it is important to remember that Bernoulli's principle does not apply in the [[boundary layer]] or in fluid flow through long [[Pipe flow|pipes]].\n\nIf the fluid flow at some point along a stream line is brought to rest, this point is called a stagnation point, and at this point the total pressure is equal to the [[stagnation pressure]].\n\n=== Applicability of incompressible flow equation to flow of gases ===\nBernoulli's equation is sometimes valid for the flow of gases: provided that there is no transfer of kinetic or potential energy from the gas flow to the compression or expansion of the gas.  If both the gas pressure and volume change simultaneously, then work will be done on or by the gas.  In this case, Bernoulli's equation \u2013 in its incompressible flow form \u2013 cannot be assumed to be valid.  However, if the gas process is entirely [[isobaric process|isobaric]], or [[isochoric process|isochoric]], then no work is done on or by the gas, (so the simple energy balance is not upset).  According to the gas law, an isobaric or isochoric process is ordinarily the only way to ensure constant density in a gas.  Also the gas density will be proportional to the ratio of pressure and absolute [[temperature]], however this ratio will vary upon compression or expansion, no matter what non-zero quantity of heat is added or removed.  The only exception is if the net heat transfer is zero, as in a complete thermodynamic cycle, or in an individual [[isentropic]] ([[friction]]less [[adiabatic]]) process, and even then this reversible process must be reversed, to restore the gas to the original pressure and specific volume, and thus density.  Only then is the original, unmodified Bernoulli equation applicable.  In this case the equation can be used if the flow speed of the gas is sufficiently below the [[speed of sound]], such that the variation in density of the gas (due to this effect) along each [[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamline]] can be ignored.  Adiabatic flow at less than Mach 0.3 is generally considered to be slow enough.\n\n=== Unsteady potential flow ===\n\nThe Bernoulli equation for unsteady potential flow is used in the theory of [[ocean surface wave]]s and [[acoustics]].\n\nFor an [[irrotational flow]], the [[flow velocity]] can be described as the [[gradient]] '''\u2207'''''\u03c6'' of a [[velocity potential]] ''\u03c6''. In that case, and for a constant [[density]] ''\u03c1'', the [[momentum]] equations of the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] can be integrated to:<ref name=Batch383>Batchelor, G.K. (1967), p. 383</ref>\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial t} + \\tfrac{1}{2} v^2 + \\frac{p}{\\rho} + gz = f(t),</math>\n\nwhich is a Bernoulli equation valid also for unsteady\u2014or time dependent\u2014flows. Here \u2202''\u03c6''/\u2202''t'' denotes the [[partial derivative]] of the velocity potential ''\u03c6'' with respect to time ''t'', and ''v''&nbsp;=&nbsp;|\u2207''\u03c6''| is the flow speed.\nThe function ''f''(''t'') depends only on time and not on position in the fluid. As a result, the Bernoulli equation at some moment ''t'' does not only apply along a certain streamline, but in the whole fluid domain. This is also true for the special case of a steady irrotational flow, in which case ''f'' is a constant.<ref name=Batch383/>\n\nFurther ''f''(''t'') can be made equal to zero by incorporating it into the velocity potential using the transformation\n\n:<math>\\Phi=\\varphi-\\int_{t_0}^t f(\\tau)\\, \\text{d}\\tau,</math> {{pad|2em}} resulting in {{pad|2em}} <math>\\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial t} + \\tfrac{1}{2} v^2 + \\frac{p}{\\rho} + gz=0.</math>\n\nNote that the relation of the potential to the flow velocity is unaffected by this transformation: \u2207''\u03a6''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2207''\u03c6''.\n\nThe Bernoulli equation for unsteady potential flow also appears to play a central role in [[Luke's variational principle]], a variational description of free-surface flows using the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] (not to be confused with [[Lagrangian coordinates]]).\n\n== Compressible flow equation ==\nBernoulli developed his principle from his observations on liquids, and his equation is applicable only to incompressible fluids, and compressible fluids up to approximately [[Mach number]] 0.3.<ref>White, Frank M. ''Fluid Mechanics'', 6e. McGraw-Hill International Edition. p. 602.</ref>  It is possible to use the fundamental principles of physics to develop similar equations applicable to compressible fluids. There are numerous equations, each tailored for a particular application, but all are analogous to Bernoulli's equation and all rely on nothing more than the fundamental principles of physics such as Newton's laws of motion or the [[first law of thermodynamics]].\n\n=== Compressible flow in fluid dynamics ===\nFor a compressible fluid, with a [[barotropic]] [[equation of state]], and under the action of [[conservative force]]s,\n\n:<math>\\frac {v^2}{2}+ \\int_{p_1}^p \\frac {d\\tilde{p}}{\\rho(\\tilde{p})}\\ + \\Psi = \\text{constant}</math><ref>Clarke C. and Carswell B., ''Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics''</ref> {{pad|3em}} (constant along a streamline)\n\nwhere:\n:''p'' is the [[pressure]]\n:''\u03c1'' is the [[density]]\n:''v'' is the [[flow speed]]\n:''\u03a8'' is the potential associated with the conservative force field, often the [[gravitational potential]]\n\nIn engineering situations, elevations are generally small compared to the size of the Earth, and the time scales of fluid flow are small enough to consider the equation of state as [[adiabatic]]. In this case, the above equation becomes\n\n:<math>\\frac {v^2}{2}+ gz+\\left(\\frac {\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}\\right)\\frac {p}{\\rho}   = \\text{constant}</math><ref>Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section&nbsp;3.11</ref> {{pad|3em}} (constant along a streamline)\n\nwhere, in addition to the terms listed above:\n:''\u03b3'' is the [[Heat capacity ratio|ratio of the specific heats]] of the fluid\n:''g'' is the acceleration due to gravity\n:''z'' is the elevation of the point above a reference plane\n\nIn many applications of compressible flow, changes in elevation are negligible compared to the other terms, so the term ''gz'' can be omitted. A very useful form of the equation is then:\n\n:<math>\\frac {v^2}{2}+\\left( \\frac {\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}\\right)\\frac {p}{\\rho}  = \\left(\\frac {\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}\\right)\\frac {p_0}{\\rho_0}</math>\n\nwhere:\n:''p''<sub>0</sub> is the [[Stagnation pressure|total pressure]]\n:''\u03c1''<sub>0</sub> is the total density\n\n=== Compressible flow in thermodynamics ===\nThe most general form of the equation, suitable for use in thermodynamics in case of (quasi) steady flow, is:<ref name=\"Batchelor_3.5\"/><ref>{{harvtxt|Landau|Lifshitz|1987|loc=\u00a75}}</ref>\n\n:<math>{v^2 \\over 2} + \\Psi + w =\\text{constant}.</math><ref>Van Wylen, G.J., and Sonntag, R.E., (1965), ''Fundamentals of Classical Thermodynamics'', Section&nbsp;5.9, John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York</ref>\n\nHere ''w'' is the [[enthalpy]] per unit mass, which is also often written as ''h'' (not to be confused with \"head\" or \"height\").\n\nNote that <math>w = \\epsilon + \\frac{p}{\\rho}</math> where ''\u03b5'' is the [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] energy per unit mass, also known as the [[specific energy|specific]] [[internal energy]]. So, for constant internal energy ''\u03b5'' the equation reduces to the incompressible-flow form.\n\nThe constant on the right hand side is often called the Bernoulli constant and denoted ''b''. For steady inviscid [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]] flow with no additional sources or sinks of energy, ''b'' is constant along any given streamline. More generally, when ''b'' may vary along streamlines, it still proves a useful parameter, related to the \"head\" of the fluid (see below).\n\nWhen the change in ''\u03a8'' can be ignored, a very useful form of this equation is:\n\n:<math>{v^2 \\over 2}+ w = w_0</math>\n\nwhere ''w''<sub>0</sub> is total enthalpy. For a calorically perfect gas such as an ideal gas, the enthalpy is directly proportional to the temperature, and this leads to the concept of the total (or stagnation) temperature.\n\nWhen [[shock wave]]s are present, in a [[frame of reference|reference frame]] in which the shock is stationary and the flow is steady, many of the parameters in the Bernoulli equation suffer abrupt changes in passing through the shock. The Bernoulli parameter itself, however, remains unaffected. An exception to this rule is radiative shocks, which violate the assumptions leading to the Bernoulli equation, namely the lack of additional sinks or sources of energy.\n\n== Derivations of Bernoulli equation ==\n:{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!Bernoulli equation for incompressible fluids\n|-\n|The Bernoulli equation for incompressible fluids can be derived by either [[integral|integrating]] [[Newton's second law of motion]] or by applying the law of [[conservation of energy]] between two sections along a streamline, ignoring [[viscosity]], compressibility, and thermal effects.\n; Derivation through integrating Newton's Second Law of Motion\nThe simplest derivation is to first ignore gravity and consider constrictions and expansions in pipes that are otherwise straight, as seen in [[Venturi effect]].

It is not a [[universal constant]], but rather a constant of a particular fluid system. The deduction is: where the speed is large, pressure is low and vice versa.\nIn the above derivation, no external work-energy principle is invoked.

For example, if the air flowing past the top surface of an aircraft wing is moving faster than the air flowing past the bottom surface, then Bernoulli's principle implies that the [[pressure]] on the surfaces of the wing will be lower above than below. This pressure difference results in an upwards [[lift (force)|lifting force]].<ref>Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section&nbsp;5.5 (\"When a stream of air flows past an airfoil, there are local changes in flow speed round the airfoil, and consequently changes in static pressure, in accordance with Bernoulli's Theorem.

The low pressure in the throat of a venturi can be explained by Bernoulli's principle; in the narrow throat, the air is moving at its fastest speed and therefore it is at its lowest pressure.\n*An [[injector]] on a steam locomotive (or static boiler). \n*The [[pitot tube]] and [[Pitot-static system|static port]] on an aircraft are used to determine the [[airspeed]] of the aircraft. These two devices are connected to the [[airspeed indicator]], which determines the [[dynamic pressure]] of the airflow past the aircraft.  Dynamic pressure is the difference between [[stagnation pressure]] and [[static pressure]].  Bernoulli's principle is used to calibrate the airspeed indicator so that it displays the [[indicated airspeed]] appropriate to the dynamic pressure.<ref>Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section&nbsp;3.8</ref>\n*The flow speed of a fluid can be measured using a device such as a [[Venturi meter]] or an [[orifice plate]], which can be placed into a pipeline to reduce the diameter of the flow. For a horizontal device, the [[Continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|continuity equation]] shows that for an incompressible fluid, the reduction in diameter will cause an increase in the fluid flow speed. Subsequently Bernoulli's principle then shows that there must be a decrease in the pressure in the reduced diameter region. This phenomenon is known as the [[Venturi effect]].\n*The maximum possible drain rate for a tank with a hole or tap at the base can be calculated directly from Bernoulli's equation, and is found to be proportional to the square root of the height of the fluid in the tank.  This is [[Torricelli's law]], showing that Torricelli's law is compatible with Bernoulli's principle.  [[Viscosity]] lowers this drain rate.

But this is not apparent from the demonstration.<ref>'\"Demonstrations\" of Bernoulli's principle are often given as demonstrations of the physics of lift. They are truly demonstrations of lift, but certainly not of Bernoulli's principle.' David F Anderson & Scott Eberhardt ''Understanding Flight'' pg 229 https://books.google.com/books?id=52Hfn7uEGSoC&pg=PA229</ref><ref>\"As an example, take the misleading experiment most often used to \"demonstrate\" Bernoulli's principle. Hold a piece of paper so that it curves over your finger, then blow across the top. The paper will rise. However most people do not realize that the paper would ''not'' rise if it were flat, even though you are blowing air across the top of it at a furious rate. Bernoulli's principle does not apply directly in this case. This is because the air on the two sides of the paper did not start out from the same source. The air on the bottom is ambient air from the room, but the air on the top came from your mouth where you actually increased its speed without decreasing its pressure by forcing it out of your mouth. As a result the air on both sides of the flat paper actually has the same pressure, even though the air on the top is moving faster. The reason that a curved piece of paper does rise is that the air from your mouth speeds up even more as it follows the curve of the paper, which in turn lowers the pressure according to Bernoulli.\" From The Aeronautics File By Max Feil https://www.mat.uc.pt/~pedro/ncientificos/artigos/aeronauticsfile1.ps {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517081630/https://www.mat.uc.pt/~pedro/ncientificos/artigos/aeronauticsfile1.ps |date=May 17, 2015 }}\n</ref><ref>\"Some people blow over a sheet of paper to demonstrate that the accelerated air over the sheet results in a lower pressure. They are wrong with their explanation. The sheet of paper goes up because it deflects the air, by the Coanda effect, and that deflection is the cause of the force lifting the sheet. To prove they are wrong I use the following experiment:\nIf the sheet of paper is pre bend the other way by first rolling it, and if you blow over it than, it goes down. This is because the air is deflected the other way.\nAirspeed is still higher above the sheet, so that is not causing the lower pressure.\" Pim Geurts. sailtheory.com    http://www.sailtheory.com/experiments.html</ref>\n\nOther common classroom demonstrations, such as blowing between two suspended spheres, inflating a large bag, or suspending a ball in an airstream are sometimes explained in a similarly misleading manner by saying \"faster moving air has lower pressure\".<ref>\"Finally, let\u2019s go back to the initial example of a ball levitating in a jet of air.
