On an aircraft the rudder is used primarily to counter [[adverse yaw]] and [[p-factor]] and is not the primary control used to turn the airplane. A rudder operates by redirecting the fluid past the [[hull (watercraft)]] or [[fuselage]], thus imparting a turning or [[yaw (rotation)|yaw]]ing motion to the craft. In basic form, a rudder is a flat plane or sheet of material attached with [[hinge]]s to the craft's [[stern]], tail, or after end. Often rudders are shaped so as to minimize [[Drag (physics)|hydrodynamic]] or [[aerodynamic drag]]. On simple [[watercraft]], a [[tiller]]\u2014essentially, a stick or pole acting as a lever arm\u2014may be attached to the top of the rudder to allow it to be turned by a [[helmsman]]. In larger vessels, cables, [[pushrod]]s, or hydraulics may be used to link rudders to steering wheels. In typical aircraft, the rudder is operated by pedals via mechanical linkages or hydraulics.\n\n==History of the rudder==\n\nGenerally, a rudder is \"part of the steering apparatus of a boat or ship that is fastened outside the hull\", that is denoting all different types of oars, paddles, and rudders.<ref name=\"rudder.Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\">rudder.Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Retrieved August 8, 2008, from [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]]</ref> More specifically, the steering gear of ancient vessels can be classified into side-rudders and stern-mounted rudders, depending on their location on the ship. A third term, [[steering oar]], can denote both types. In a [[Mediterranean]] context, side-rudders are more specifically called quarter-rudders as the later term designates more exactly the place where the rudder was mounted. Stern-mounted rudders are uniformly suspended at the back of the ship in a central position.<ref name=\"William F. Edgerton 255-265\">William F.

A steering oar was used at this time because the rudder had not yet been invented. With a single sail, a frequent movement of the steering oar was required to steer a straight course; this slowed down the vessel because a steering oar (or rudder) course correction acts like a brake. The second sail, located forward, could be trimmed to offset the turning tendency of the main sail and minimize the need for course corrections by the steering oar, which would have substantially improved sail performance.<ref>Block, Leo.

Mott,p. 84, p. 92</ref>\n\n==Boat rudders details==\nBoat rudders may be either outboard or inboard. Outboard rudders are hung on the stern or transom. Inboard rudders are hung from a keel or skeg and are thus fully submerged beneath the hull, connected to the steering mechanism by a rudder post which comes up through the hull to deck level, often into a cockpit.  Inboard keel hung rudders (which are a continuation of the aft trailing edge of the full keel) are traditionally deemed the most damage resistant rudders for off shore sailing.  Better performance with faster handling characteristics can be provided by skeg hung rudders on boats with smaller fin keels.\n\nRudder post and mast placement defines the difference between a ketch and a yawl, as these two-masted vessels are similar. Yawls are defined as having the mizzen mast abaft (i.e. \"aft of\") the rudder post; ketches are defined as having the mizzen mast forward of the rudder post.\n\nSmall boat rudders that can be steered more or less perpendicular to the hull's longitudinal axis make effective brakes when pushed \"hard over.\" However, terms such as \"hard over,\" \"hard to starboard,\" etc. signify a maximum-rate turn for larger vessels.  Transom hung rudders or far aft mounted fin rudders generate greater moment and faster turning than more forward mounted keel hung rudders.\n\nThere is also the '''barrel type rudder''' where the ships screw is enclosed and can swiveled to steer the vessel.  Designers claim that this type of rudder on a smaller vessel will answer the helm faster.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xd8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA495&dq=%22Popular+Mechanics%22+Jan+1935+floating&hl=en&ei=Wtc4TsGsDeSusAKXtpka&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&sqi=2&ved=0CFUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Barrel Type Rudder Makes Quicker Turns\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', October 1934, bottom-right pg.495</ref>\n\n== Aircraft rudders == <!--linked from [[HAL Tejas]] and [[American Airlines Flight 587]]-->\n[[File:Ayaw.gif|thumb|Movement caused by the use of rudder.]]\n[[File:MM00756-4.jpg|thumb|The nose gear steering-wheel ([[tiller]]) is visible as a semi-circular wheel to the left of the yoke in this photo of a Boeing 727 cockpit]]\n[[File:Light aircraft rudder and trim tab.JPG|thumb|Rudder and trim tab on a [[light aircraft]]]]\nOn an aircraft, the '''rudder''' is a directional [[Flight control surfaces|control surface]] along with the rudder-like [[elevator (aircraft)|elevator]] (usually attached to horizontal tail structure, if not a slab elevator ) and [[ailerons]] (attached to the wings) that control pitch and roll, respectively.  The rudder is usually attached to the [[fin]] (or [[vertical stabilizer]]) which allows the pilot to control [[Flight dynamics|yaw]] about the vertical axis, i.e. change the horizontal direction in which the nose is pointing.  The rudder's direction in aircraft since [[Aviation between the World Wars|the \"Golden Age\" of flight]] between the two World Wars into the 21st century has been manipulated with the movement of a pair of counter-moving foot pedals by the pilot, while during the pre-1919 era rudder control was most often operated with by a center-pivoted, solid \"rudder bar\" which usually had pedal and/or stirrup-like hardware on its ends to allow the pilot's feet to stay close to the ends of the bar's rear surface.\n\nIn practice, both aileron and rudder control input are used together to turn an aircraft, the ailerons imparting roll, the rudder imparting yaw, and also compensating for a phenomenon called [[adverse yaw]]. A rudder alone will turn a conventional fixed-wing aircraft, but much more slowly than if ailerons are also used in conjunction.  Use of rudder and ailerons together produces co-ordinated turns, in which the longitudinal axis of the aircraft is in line with the arc of the turn, neither [[slip (aerodynamic)|slip]]ping (under-ruddered), nor skidding (over-ruddered). Improperly ruddered turns at low speed can precipitate a [[spin (flight)|spin]] which can be dangerous at low altitudes.\n\nSometimes pilots may intentionally operate the rudder and ailerons in opposite directions in a maneuver called a [[Slip (aerodynamic)|slip]]. This may be done to overcome crosswinds and keep the fuselage in line with the runway, or to more rapidly lose altitude by increasing drag, or both. The pilots of [[Air Canada Flight 143]] used a similar technique to land the plane as it was too high above the glideslope.\n\nAny aircraft rudder is subject to considerable forces that determine its position via a force or torque balance equation. In extreme cases these forces can lead to loss of rudder control or even destruction of the rudder, as on [[American Airlines Flight 587]] (the same principles also apply to water vessels, of course, but it is more important for aircraft because they have lower engineering margins). Maximum rudder deflection is controlled by [[rudder travel limiter]]. The largest achievable angle of a rudder in flight is called its '''blowdown limit'''; it is achieved when the force from the air or blowdown equals the maximum available hydraulic pressure.\n\nIn multi-engined aircraft where the engines are off the centre line, the rudder may be used to compensate for the yaw effect of asymmetric thrust, for example in the event of engine failure. Further, on large jet airliners, the rudder is mainly used to align the aircraft with the runway during [[crosswind landing]] and take-off. \n\nFor taxiing and during the beginning of the take-off, aircraft are steered by a combination of rudder input as well as turning the nosewheel or tailwheel.  At slow speeds the nosewheel or tailwheel has the most control authority, but as the speed increases the aerodynamic effects of the rudder increases, thereby making the rudder more and more important for yaw control.  In some aircraft (mainly small aircraft) both of these mechanisms are controlled by the rudder pedals so there is no difference to the pilot.  In other aircraft there is a special tiller controlling the wheel steering and the pedals control the rudder.  For these aircraft there is usually a speed stipulated at which the pilots should change from steering with the wheels to steering with the rudder.  This speed is usually in the neighbourhood of 80 knots.\n\n==Trim tab==\n{{main|Trim tab}}\n'''Trim tabs''' are small surfaces connected to the trailing edge of a larger [[Flight control surfaces|control surface]], such as a rudder, on an [[aircraft]], used to control the [[trim (aircraft)|trim]] of the controls, i.e. to counteract aerodynamic forces and stabilise the aircraft in a particular desired attitude without the need for the operator to constantly apply a control force. This is done by adjusting the angle of the tab relative to the larger surface.\n\nChanging the setting of a trim tab adjusts the neutral or resting position of a control surface (such as an [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevator]] or rudder). As the desired position of a control surface changes (corresponding mainly to different speeds), an adjustable trim tab will allow the operator to reduce the manual force required to maintain that position\u2014to zero, if used correctly.  Thus the trim tab acts as a [[servo tab]].  Because the [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]] of the trim tab is further away from the axis of rotation of the control surface than the center of pressure of the control surface, the movement generated by the tab can match the movement generated by the control surface. The position of the control surface on its axis will change until the torque from the control surface and the trim surface balance each other.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* [http://nautarch.tamu.edu/pdf-files/Mott-MA1991.pdf Lawrence V.
