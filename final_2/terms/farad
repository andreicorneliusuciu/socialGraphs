For example, if the potential difference across a capacitor is halved, the quantity of charge stored by that capacitor will also be halved.<!--Sub-units are not defined yet so stick to the main units-->\n\nFor most applications, the farad is an impractically large unit of capacitance.

The original capacitor was the [[Leyden jar]] developed in the 18th century. It is the accumulation of electric charge on the plates that results in [[capacitance]]. Modern capacitors are constructed using a range of manufacturing techniques and materials to provide the extraordinarily wide range of capacitance values used in [[electronics]] applications from femtofarads to farads, with maximum-voltage ratings ranging from a few [[volt]]s to several kilovolts.\n\nValues of capacitors are usually [[SI prefix#List of SI prefixes|specified in]] '''farads''' (F), <!--'''millifarads''' (mF),--> '''microfarads''' (\u03bcF), '''nanofarads''' (nF) and '''picofarads''' (pF).<ref name=\"Braga\">{{cite book |title=Robotics, Mechatronics, and Artificial Intelligence |last=Braga |first=Newton C. |year=2002 |accessdate=2008-09-17 |publisher=Newnes |page=21 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yqb-f-HKem0C&pg=PA21&q=microfarad+common+measurement |isbn=0-7506-7389-3 |quote=Common measurement units are the microfarad (\u03bcF), representing 0.000,001 F; the nanofarad (nF), representing 0.000,000,001 F; and the picofarad (pF), representing 0.000,000,000,001 F.}}</ref> The millifarad is rarely used in practice (a capacitance of 4.7&nbsp;mF (0.0047&nbsp;F), for example, is instead written as {{gaps|4|700|u=\u00b5F}}), while the nanofarad is uncommon in North America.<ref>{{cite book |title=Make: Electronics: Learning Through Discovery |last=Platt |first=Charles |year=2009 |accessdate=2014-07-22 |publisher=O'Reilly Media |page=61 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PQzYdC3BtQkC&pg=PA61&dq=nanofarad |isbn=9781449388799 |quote=Nanofarads are also used, more often in Europe than in the United States.}}</ref> The size of commercially available capacitors ranges from around 0.1&nbsp;pF to {{Gaps|5|000|F}} (5&nbsp;kF) [[supercapacitor]]s. [[Parasitic capacitance]] in high-performance [[integrated circuit]]s can be measured in femtofarads (1 fF = 0.001&nbsp;pF = {{10^|-15}}&nbsp;F), while high-performance test equipment can detect changes in capacitance on the order of tens of attofarads (1 aF = {{10^|\u221218}}&nbsp;F).<ref>{{cite book |title=Analog MOS Integrated Circuits for Signal Processing |last=Gregorian |first=Roubik |year=1976 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |page=78}}</ref>\n\nA value of 0.1&nbsp;pF is about the smallest available in capacitors for general use in electronic design, since smaller ones would be dominated by the [[parasitic capacitance]]s of other components, wiring or [[printed circuit board]]s.

If [[Mu (letter)|the Greek letter \u03bc]] is not available, the notation \"uF\" is often used as a substitute for \"\u03bcF\" in electronics literature. A \"micro-microfarad\" (\u03bc\u03bcF, and confusingly often mmf or MMF), an obsolete unit sometimes found in older texts, is the equivalent of a picofarad.  In texts prior to 1960, and on capacitor packages even much more recently, '''mf''' or '''MFD''' rather than the modern '''\u00b5F''' frequently represented microfarads. Similarly, '''mmf''' or '''MMFD''' represented picofarads.\n\n=== Related concepts ===\n\nThe reciprocal of capacitance is called [[Capacitance#Capacitance matrix|electrical elastance]], the (non-standard, non-SI) unit of which is the [[daraf]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Daraf |url=http://www.websters-dictionary-online.com/definitions/daraf |publisher=Webster's Online Dictionary |accessdate=2009-06-19}}</ref>\n\n==CGS units==\nThe '''abfarad''' (abbreviated abF) is an obsolete [[Centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system of units#Electromagnetic units in various CGS systems|CGS unit of capacitance]] equal to {{10^|9}} farads (1 gigafarad, GF).<ref>{{cite book |title=Modern Dictionary of Electronics |last=Graf |first=Rudolf F. |year=1999 |publisher=Newnes |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYEKAQAAQBAJ |isbn=9780080511986 |accessdate=2016-04-15}}</ref>\n\nThe '''statfarad''' (abbreviated statF) is a rarely used CGS unit equivalent to the capacitance of a capacitor with a charge of 1 [[statcoulomb]] across a potential difference of 1 [[statvolt]].
