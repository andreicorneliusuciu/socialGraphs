Note that the threshold voltage for this device lies around 0.45&nbsp;V.]]\n\nThe '''threshold voltage''', commonly abbreviated as V<sub>th</sub> or V<sub>GS (th)</sub>, of a [[field-effect transistor]] (FET) is the minimum gate-to-source voltage differential that is needed to create a conducting path between the source and drain terminals. \n\nWhen referring to a [[JFET|junction field-effect transistor]] (JFET), the threshold voltage is often called \"pinch-off voltage\" instead. This is somewhat confusing since \"pinch off\" applied to [[IGFET|insulated-gate field-effect transistor]] (IGFET) refers to the [[channel length modulation|channel pinching]] that leads to current saturation behaviour under high source\u2013drain bias, even though the current is never off. Unlike \"pinch off\", the term \"threshold voltage\" is unambiguous and refers to the same concept in any field-effect transistor.\n\n==Basic principles==\nIn [[n-type semiconductor|n-channel]] ''enhancement-mode'' devices, a conductive channel does not exist naturally within the transistor, and a positive gate-to-source voltage is necessary to create one. The positive voltage attracts free-floating electrons within the body towards the gate, forming a conductive channel. But first, enough electrons must be attracted near the gate to counter the dopant ions added to the body of the FET; this forms a region with no mobile carriers called a [[depletion region]], and the voltage at which this occurs is the ''threshold voltage'' of the FET. Further gate-to-source voltage increase will attract even more electrons towards the gate which are able to create a conductive channel from source to drain; this process is called ''inversion''.\n\nIn contrast, n-channel ''depletion-mode'' devices have a conductive channel naturally existing within the transistor. Accordingly, the term 'threshold voltage' does not readily apply to turn such devices 'on', but is used instead to denote the voltage level at which the channel is wide enough to allow electrons to flow easily. This ease-of-flow threshold also applies to [[p-type semiconductor|p-channel]] ''depletion-mode'' devices, in which a positive voltage from gate to body/source creates a depletion layer by forcing the positively charged holes away from the gate-insulator/semiconductor interface, leaving exposed a carrier-free region of immobile, negatively charged acceptor ions.\n\nIn wide planar transistors the threshold voltage is essentially independent of the drain\u2013source voltage and is therefore a well defined characteristic, however it is less clear in modern nanometer-sized MOSFETs due to [[drain-induced barrier lowering]].\n\n[[Image:MOSFET DepletionRegion.png|thumbnail|200px|Depletion region of an nMOSFET biased below the threshold]]\n[[Image:MOSFET above threshold.png|thumbnail|200px|Depletion region of an nMOSFET biased above the threshold with channel formed]]\nIn the figures, the source (left side) and drain (right side) are labeled ''n+'' to indicate heavily doped (blue) n-regions. The depletion layer dopant is labeled ''N<sub>A</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>'' to indicate that the ions in the (pink) depletion layer are negatively charged and there are very few holes. In the (red) bulk the number of holes ''p&nbsp;=&nbsp;N<sub>A</sub>'' making the bulk charge neutral.\n\nIf the gate voltage is below the threshold voltage (top figure), the transistor is turned off and ideally there is no [[Electric current|current]] from the drain to the source of the transistor. In fact, there is a current even for gate biases below the threshold ([[subthreshold leakage]]) current, although it is small and varies exponentially with gate bias.\n\nIf the gate voltage is above the threshold voltage (lower figure), the transistor is turned on, due to there being many electrons in the channel at the oxide-silicon interface, creating a low-resistance channel where charge can flow from drain to source. For voltages significantly above the threshold, this situation is called strong inversion. The channel is tapered when ''V<sub>D</sub> > 0'' because the voltage drop due to the current in the resistive channel reduces the oxide field supporting the channel as the drain is approached.\n\n==Body effect==\n\nThe ''body effect'' is the change in the threshold voltage by an amount approximately equal to the change in <math>V_{SB}</math>, the source-bulk voltage. Because the body influences the threshold voltage (when it is not tied to the source), it can be thought of as a second gate, and is sometimes referred to as the \"back gate\"; the body effect is sometimes called the \"back-gate effect\".<ref>Marco Delaurenti, PhD dissertation, ''[http://equars.com/~marco/poli/phd/node20.html Design and optimization techniques of high-speed VLSI circuits'' (1999))]</ref>\n\nFor an enhancement mode, nMOS MOSFET body effect upon threshold voltage is computed according to the Shichman\u2013Hodges model<ref>[http://www.biosignostix.com/uploads/2/0/4/9/20491868/ndt14_08_2007.pdf NanoDotTek Report NDT14-08-2007, 12 August 2007]</ref> (accurate for very old technology) using the following equation.\n\n::<math>V_{TN} = V_{TO} + \\gamma ( \\sqrt{ | {V_{SB} + 2\\phi_{F} | } } - \\sqrt{ | 2\\phi_{F} | } )</math>\n\nwhere <math>V_{TN}</math> is the threshold voltage when substrate bias is present, <math>V_{SB}</math> is the source-to-body substrate bias, <math>2\\phi_F</math> is the surface potential, and <math>V_{TO}</math> is threshold voltage for zero substrate bias, <math>\\gamma = (t_{ox}/\\epsilon_{ox})\\sqrt{2q\\epsilon_{si}N_A}</math> is the body effect parameter, <math>t_{ox}</math> is oxide thickness, <math>\\epsilon_{ox}</math> is oxide [[permittivity]], <math>\\epsilon_{si}</math> is the permittivity of silicon, <math>N_A</math> is a doping concentration, <math>q</math> is the charge of an electron.\n\n==Dependence on oxide thickness==\n\nIn a given technology node, such as the [[90 nanometer|90-nm]] CMOS process, the threshold voltage depends on the choice of oxide and on '''oxide thickness'''. Using the body formulas above, <math>V_{TN}</math> is directly proportional to <math>\\gamma</math>, and <math>t_{OX}</math>, which is the parameter for oxide thickness.\n\nThus, the thinner the oxide thickness, the lower the threshold voltage. Although this may seem to be an improvement, it is not without cost; because the thinner the oxide thickness, the higher the [[subthreshold leakage]] current through the device will be. Consequently, the design specification for 90-nm gate-oxide thickness was set at 1&nbsp;nm to control the leakage current.<ref>Sugii, Watanabe and Sugatani.

With a 90&nbsp;nm&nbsp;process technology, a triple-oxide approach has been adopted in some cases.<ref>Anil Telikepalli, Xilinx Inc, ''Power considerations in designing with 90 nm FPGAs'' (2005))[http://www.pldesignline.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=174402265/]</ref> One standard thin oxide is used for most transistors, another for I/O driver cells, and a third for memory-and-pass transistor cells. These differences are based purely on the characteristics of oxide thickness on threshold voltage of CMOS technologies.\n\n==Dependence on temperature==\nAs with the case of oxide thickness affecting threshold voltage, '''temperature''' has an effect on the threshold voltage of a CMOS device. Expanding on part of the equation in the [[MOSFET#Body effect|body effect]] section\n\n::<math>\\phi_F = (kT/q) \\ln{(N_A/N_i)}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\phi_F</math> is half the contact potential, <math>k</math> is [[Boltzmann's constant]], <math>T</math> is Temperature, <math>q</math> is the charge of an electron, <math>N_A</math> is a doping parameter and <math>N_i</math> is the intrinsic doping parameter for the substrate.\n\nWe see that the surface potential has a direct relationship with the temperature. Looking above, that the threshold voltage does not have a direct relationship but is not independent of the effects. On average this variation is between \u22124&nbsp;mV/K and \u22122&nbsp;mV/K depending on doping level.<ref>Weste and Eshraghian, ''Principles of CMOS VLSI Design : a systems perspective'', Second Edition, (1993) pp.48 ISBN 0-201-53376-6</ref> For a change of 30&nbsp;\u00b0C this results in significant variation from the 500&nbsp;mV design parameter commonly used for the 90&nbsp;nm&nbsp;technology&nbsp;node.\n\n==Dependence on random dopant fluctuation==\n\n[[Random dopant fluctuation]](RDF) is a form of process variation resulting from variation in the implanted impurity concentration. In MOSFET transistors, RDF in the channel region can alter the transistor's properties, especially threshold voltage. In newer process technologies RDF has a larger effect because the total number of dopants is fewer.<ref>Asenov, A.
