Invented by the [[Germany|German]] physicist [[August Toepler]] in 1864 to study supersonic motion, it is widely used in [[aeronautical engineering]] to photograph the flow of air around objects.\n\n== Classical optical system==\nThe classical implementation of an optical schlieren system uses light from a single [[collimated]] source shining on, or from behind, a target object. Variations in [[refractive index]] caused by [[Density Gradient|density gradients]] in the fluid distort the collimated light beam. This distortion creates a spatial variation in the intensity of the light, which can be visualised directly with a [[shadowgraph]] system.\n\nIn classical schlieren photography, the [[collimated light]] is focused with a converging optical element (usually a lens or curved mirror), and a knife-edge is placed at the focal point, positioned to block about half the light. In flow of uniform density this will simply make the photograph half as bright. However, in flow with density variations the distorted beam focuses imperfectly, and parts which have been focused in an area covered by the knife-edge are blocked. The result is a set of lighter and darker patches corresponding to positive and negative fluid density gradients in the direction normal to the knife-edge. When a knife-edge is used, the system is generally referred to as a ''schlieren system'', which measures the first derivative of density in the direction of the knife-edge. If a knife-edge is not used, the system is generally referred to as a ''[[shadowgraph]] system'', which measures the second derivative of density.\n\nIf the fluid flow is uniform the image will be steady, but any [[turbulence]] will cause [[scintillation (astronomy)|scintillation]], the shimmering effect that can be seen on hot surfaces on a sunny day. To visualise instantaneous density profiles, a short duration [[Flash (photography)|flash]] (rather than continuous illumination) may be used.\n\n== Focusing schlieren optical system ==\nIn the mid 20th century, R.A. Burton developed an alternative form of schlieren photography which is now usually called ''focusing schlieren'' or ''lens and grid schlieren'',<ref>Burton, R.A., \"A Modified Schlieren Apparatus for Large Areas of Field,\" J. Opt. Soc. Am. 39, 907\u2013907 (1949).</ref> based on a suggestion by [[Hubert Schardin]].<ref>Schardin, H., Ergebnisse der Exakten Natur-wissenschaft 20, p. 303 (1942)</ref> Focusing schlieren systems generally retain the characteristic knife edge to produce contrast, but instead of using collimated light and a single knife edge, they use an illumination pattern of repeated edges with a focusing imaging system.\n\n[[File:Focusingschlieren.PNG|upright=2.0|center|thumb|Basic diagram of a focusing schlieren system]]\n\nThe basic idea is that the illumination pattern is imaged onto a geometrically congruent cutoff pattern (essentially a multiplicity of knife edges) with focusing optics, while density gradients lying between the illumination pattern and the cutoff pattern are imaged, typically by a camera system. As in classical schlieren, the distortions produce regions of brightening or darkening corresponding to the position and direction of the distortion, because they redirect rays either away from or onto the opaque part of the cutoff pattern. While in classical schlieren, distortions over the whole beam path are visualized equally, in focusing schlieren, only distortions in the object field of the camera are clearly imaged. Distortions away from the object field become blurred, so this technique allows some degree of depth selection. It also has the advantage that a wide variety of illuminated backgrounds can be used, since collimation is not required. This allows construction of projection-based focusing schlieren systems which are much easier to build and align than classical schlieren systems. The requirement of collimated light in classical schlieren is often a substantial practical barrier for constructing large systems due to the need for the collimating optic to be the same size as the field of view. Focusing schlieren systems can use compact optics with a large background illumination pattern, which is particularly easy to produce with a projection system. For systems with large demagnification, the illumination pattern needs to be around twice the size of the field of view to allow for defocusing of the background pattern.<ref>Goulding, J.S., [A Study of Large-Scale Focusing Schlieren Systems], Masters Thesis, University of Witwatersrand (2006).</ref><ref>Weinstein, L.M., \u201cReview and update of lens and grid schlieren and motion camera schlieren,\u201d Eur. Phys. J. Special Topics 182, 65\u201395 (2010).</ref>\n\n== Background-oriented techniques ==\n{{main|Background-oriented schlieren technique}}\n\nA third major type of schlieren photography relies measuring or visualizing shifts in focused images. In these techniques, the background and the schlieren object (the distortion to be visualized) are both in focus and the distortion is detected because it moves part of the background image relative to its original position. Because of this focus requirement, they tend to be used for large-scale applications where both the schlieren object and the background are distant (typically beyond the [[hyperfocal distance]] of the optical system). Since these systems require no additional optics aside from a camera, they are often the simplest to construct but they are usually not as sensitive as other types of schlieren systems, with the sensitivity being limited by the camera resolution. The technique also requires a suitable background image. In some cases, the background may be provided by the experimenter, such as a random speckle pattern or sharp line, but naturally occurring features such as landscape or even the edge of the Sun have been used. Background-oriented schlieren is most often performed using software techniques such as [[digital image correlation]] and [[optical flow]] analysis to perform [[synthetic schlieren]], but it is possible to achieve the same effect in [[High-speed photography#Streak photography|streak imaging]] with an analog optical system.\n\n== Variations and applications ==\nVariations on the optical schlieren method include the replacement of the knife-edge by a coloured target, resulting in ''rainbow schlieren'' which can assist in visualising the flow. Different edge configurations such as concentric rings can also give sensitivity to variable gradient directions, and programmable digital edge generation has been demonstrated as well using digital displays and modulators. The [[adaptive optics]] [[pyramid wavefront sensor]] is a modified form of schlieren (having two perpendicular knife edges formed by the vertices of a refracting square pyramid).\n\nComplete schlieren optical systems can be built from components, or bought as commercially available instruments. Details of theory and operation are given in Settles' 2001 book.<ref>Settles, G. S., ''Schlieren and shadowgraph techniques: Visualizing phenomena in transparent media'', Berlin:Springer-Verlag, 2001.</ref> The USSR once produced a number of sophisticated schlieren systems based on the [[Maksutov telescope]] principle, many of which still survive in the former Soviet Union and China.\n\nSchlieren photography is used to visualise the flows of the media, which are themselves transparent (hence, their movement cannot be seen directly), but form refractive index gradients, which become visible in schlieren images either as shades of grey or even in colour. Refractive index gradients can be caused either by changes of temperature/pressure of the same fluid or by the variations of the concentration of components in mixtures and solutions. A typical application in gas dynamics is the study of shock waves in ballistics and supersonic or hypersonic vehicles. Flows caused by heating, physical absorption<ref>A. Okhotsimskii, M. Hozawa. Schlieren visualization of natural convection in binary gas-liquid systems. Chemical Engineering Science, Volume 53, Number 14, 15 July 1998, pp. 2547-2573</ref> or chemical reactions can be visualised. Thus schlieren photography can be used in many engineering problems such as heat transfer, leak detection, study of boundary layer detachment, and characterization of optics.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Laser schlieren deflectometry]]\n* [[Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer]]\n* [[Moire deflectometry]]\n* [[Schlieren]]\n* [[Shadowgraph]]\n* [[Schlieren imaging]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Schlieren photography}}\n* {{cite news | first=Denise | last=Grady | title=The Mysterious Cough, Caught on Film | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/science/28cough.html | page=D3 | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=2008-10-28 | accessdate=2008-10-28}}\n* [http://www.ian.org/Schlieren/HowTo.html Schlieren Photography \u2013 How Does It Work?]\n* [http://mousegunaddict.blogspot.com/2013/06/high-speed-ballistics-imaging-guest.html?showComment=1370910308484 High-Speed Ballistic Imaging]\n* [http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/1.OE.52.8.083105 \u201cDigital synchroballistic schlieren camera for high-speed photography of bullets and rocket sleds,\u201d] in Optical Engineering (subscription to SPIE Digital Library required)\n\n{{Photography}}\n\n[[Category:Optics]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]"}]}}}}
