Depending on the tool attached to the end of the hot stick, it is possible to test for voltage, tighten nuts and bolts, apply [[tie wires]] (twisted lengths of ductile wire which fasten the running cable to its supporting [[Electrical insulation#Telegraph and power transmission insulators|insulators]]), open and close [[switch]]es, replace [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]]s, lay insulating sleeves on wires, and perform various other tasks while not exposing the crew to a large risk of [[electric shock]].<ref name=\"Cadick\">{{cite book\n  | last = Cadick \n  | first = John\n  | authorlink = \n  |author2=Mary Capelli-Schellpfeffer |author3=Dennis Neitzel\n   | title = Electrical Safety Handbook \n  | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional\n  | year = 2005\n  | location = USA\n  | pages = 2.44-2.48 \n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_8tlhuXZrOwC&pg=PT73&lpg=PT73&dq=%22hot+stick%22+electrical&source=web&ots=ntltIsOdps&sig=_CN1yUkMydvN4J9Y9JJhL7atdRo&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=9&ct=result#PPT73,M1\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 0-07-145772-0}}</ref>\n\nHot sticks are made in different lengths, from a few feet long up to telescoping types of 30 feet length.  Because the fiberglass provides [[electrical insulation]], the hot stick allows utility workers to perform operations on power lines safely without de-energizing them or while the state of the power line is not yet known. This is essential because certain operations (such as opening or closing combination fuse/switches) must occasionally be performed on an energized line. Additionally, after a fault occurs, the exact state of a line may not be certain; in this case, for reasons of crew safety, the utility workers must treat the line as though it were energized until it can be proven that it is not and safety ground cables can be applied to the line (so that the line is guaranteed to remain [[Ground (electricity)|grounded/earthed]] while maintenance is performed upon it).  \nIf power tools are fitted to the end of the hot stick, they are usually powered [[Hydraulic machinery|hydraulically]] rather than electrically because, like the fiberglass of the hot stick, the [[hydraulic fluid]] is also a good insulator. The hydraulic power is commonly supplied from the bucket truck ([[cherry picker]] or [[aerial work platform]]) supporting the workers.  \n\nThe hot stick not only electrically insulates the worker from the energized conductor, it provides physical separation from the device being operated, to reduce the chances of burns which might result from [[Electric arc|electrical arcing]] if there is a malfunction of the device being operated.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Hoaglund\n  | first = Hugh\n  | authorlink = \n  |author2=Bruce Sannar |author3=Kent Givens |author4=John Winn |author5=Luciana Galo\n   | title = Facing up to the arc challenge\n  | work =\n  | publisher = Occupational Health & Safety magazine\n  | date = 2003-05-01\n  | url = http://www.ohsonline.com/articles/44540/\n  | format = \n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = 2008-10-27}}</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4CfHi4k3x4 Video of electrical arc, YouTube]</ref> \n\nIn the United States, [[ASTM]] Standard F 711 specifies the stringent requirements for hot sticks, and U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] standards require that they be inspected and electrically tested every two years.<ref name=\"Cadick\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Fuse cutout]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n{{tool-stub}}\n\n[[Category:Electrical construction tools]]\n[[Category:Electrical safety]]"}]}}}}
