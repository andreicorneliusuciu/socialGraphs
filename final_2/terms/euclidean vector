Vectors can be added to other vectors according to [[vector algebra]]. A Euclidean vector is frequently represented by a [[line segment]] with a definite direction, or graphically as an arrow, connecting an ''initial point'' ''A'' with a ''terminal point'' ''B'',<ref>{{harvnb|Ito|1993|p=1678}}; {{harvnb|Pedoe|1988}}</ref> and denoted by <math>\\overrightarrow{AB}.</math>\n\nA vector is what is needed to \"carry\" the point ''A'' to the point ''B''; the Latin word ''vector'' means \"carrier\".<ref>Latin: vectus, [[perfect participle]] of vehere, \"to carry\"/ ''veho'' = \"I carry\".

Many [[algebraic operation]]s on [[real number]]s such as [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[Additive inverse|negation]] have close analogues for vectors, operations which obey the familiar algebraic laws of [[commutativity]], [[associativity]], and [[distributivity]]. These operations and associated laws qualify [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] vectors as an example of the more generalized concept of vectors defined simply as elements of a [[vector space]].\n\nVectors play an important role in [[physics]]: the [[velocity]] and [[acceleration]] of a moving object and the [[force]]s acting on it can all be described with vectors. Many other physical quantities can be usefully thought of as vectors. Although most of them do not represent distances (except, for example, [[position (vector)|position]] or [[displacement (vector)|displacement]]), their magnitude and direction can still be represented by the length and direction of an arrow. The mathematical representation of a physical vector depends on the [[coordinate system]] used to describe it. Other vector-like objects that describe physical quantities and transform in a similar way under changes of the coordinate system include [[pseudovector]]s and [[tensor]]s.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of vector, as we know it today, evolved gradually over a period of more than 200 years. About a dozen people made significant contributions.<ref name=\"Crowe\">Michael J. Crowe, [[A History of Vector Analysis]]; see also his {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040126161844/http://www.nku.edu/~curtin/crowe_oresme.pdf |date=January 26, 2004 |title=lecture notes }} on the subject.</ref>\n\n[[Giusto Bellavitis]] abstracted the basic idea in 1835 when he established the concept of [[equipollence (geometry)|equipollence]]. Working in a Euclidean plane, he made equipollent any pair of line segments of the same length and orientation. Essentially he realized an [[equivalence relation]] on the pairs of points (bipoints) in the plane and thus erected the first space of vectors in the plane.<ref name=\"Crowe\"/>{{rp|52\u20134}}\n\nThe term '''vector''' was introduced by [[William Rowan Hamilton]] as part of his system of [[quaternion]]s ''q'' = ''s'' + ''v'' where \"scalar\" s \u2208 \u211d and \"vector\" ''v'' \u2208 \u211d<sup>3</sup>. Thus Hamilton's vectors are 3-dimensional. Like Bellavitis, Hamilton viewed vectors as representative of [[equivalence class|classes]] of equipollent directed segments. As [[complex number]]s use an [[imaginary unit]] to complement the [[real line]], Hamilton considered vectors ''v'' to be the \"imaginary part\" of quaternions:\n:The algebraically imaginary part, being geometrically constructed by a straight line, or radius vector, which has, in general, for each determined quaternion, a determined length and determined direction in space, may be called the vector part, or simply the vector of the quaternion.<ref>W. R. Hamilton (1846) ''London, Edinburgh & Dublin Philosophical Magazine'' 3rd series 29 27</ref>\n\nSeveral other mathematicians developed vector-like systems in the middle of the nineteenth century,  including [[Augustin Cauchy]], [[Hermann Grassmann]], [[August M\u00f6bius]], [[Comte de Saint-Venant]], and [[Matthew O'Brien (mathematician)|Matthew O'Brien]]. Grassmann's 1840 work ''Theorie der Ebbe und Flut'' (Theory of the Ebb and Flow) was the first system of spatial analysis similar to today's system and had ideas corresponding to the cross product, scalar product and vector differentiation. Grassmann's work was largely neglected until the 1870s.<ref name=\"Crowe\"/>\n\n[[Peter Guthrie Tait]] carried the quaternion standard after Hamilton. His 1867 ''Elementary Treatise of Quaternions'' included extensive treatment of the nabla or [[del|del operator]] \u2207.\n\nIn 1878 ''[[Elements of Dynamic]]'' was published by [[William Kingdon Clifford]]. Clifford simplified the quaternion study by isolating the [[dot product]] and [[cross product]] of two vectors from the complete quaternion product. This approach made vector calculations available to engineers and others working in three dimensions and skeptical of the fourth.\n\n[[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], who was exposed to quaternions through [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s ''Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism'', separated off their vector part for independent treatment. The first half of Gibbs's ''Elements of Vector Analysis'', published in 1881, presents what is essentially the modern system of vector analysis.<ref name=\"Crowe\" /> In 1901 [[Edwin Bidwell Wilson]] published ''[[Vector Analysis]]'', adapted from Gibb's lectures, which banished any mention of quaternions in the development of vector calculus.\n\n==Overview==\nIn [[physics]] and [[engineering]], a vector is typically regarded as a geometric entity characterized by a [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and a direction. It is formally defined as a directed [[line segment]], or arrow, in a [[Euclidean space]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ito|1993|p=1678}}</ref> In [[pure mathematics]], a vector is defined more generally as any element of a [[vector space]]. In this context, vectors are abstract entities which may or may not be characterized by a magnitude and a direction. This generalized definition implies that the above-mentioned geometric entities are a special kind of vectors, as they are elements of a special kind of vector space called [[Euclidean space]].\n\nThis article is about vectors strictly defined as arrows in Euclidean space. When it becomes necessary to distinguish these special vectors from vectors as defined in pure mathematics, they are sometimes referred to as '''geometric''', '''spatial''', or '''Euclidean''' vectors.\n\nBeing an arrow, a Euclidean vector possesses a definite ''initial point'' and ''terminal point''. A vector with fixed initial and terminal point is called a '''bound vector'''.<ref>Formerly known as ''located vector''. See {{harvnb|Lang|1986|page=9}}.</ref> When only the magnitude and direction of the vector matter, then the particular initial point is of no importance, and the vector is called a '''free vector'''. Thus two arrows <math>\\overrightarrow{AB}</math> and <math>\\overrightarrow{A'B'}</math> in space represent the same free vector if they have the same magnitude and direction: that is, they are equivalent if the quadrilateral ''ABB\u2032A\u2032'' is a [[parallelogram]]. If the Euclidean space is equipped with a choice of [[origin (mathematics)|origin]], then a free vector is equivalent to the bound vector of the same magnitude and direction whose initial point is the origin.\n\nThe term ''vector'' also has generalizations to higher dimensions and to more formal approaches with much wider applications.\n\n===Examples in one dimension===\nSince the physicist's concept of [[force (physics)|force]] has a direction and a magnitude, it may be seen as a vector. As an example, consider a rightward force ''F'' of 15 [[Newton (unit)|newtons]]. If the positive [[axis (mathematics)|axis]] is also directed rightward, then ''F'' is represented by the vector 15 N, and if positive points leftward, then the vector for ''F'' is \u221215 N. In either case, the magnitude of the vector is 15 N. Likewise, the vector representation of a displacement \u0394''s'' of 4 [[meter (unit)|meters]] would be 4 m or \u22124 m, depending on its direction, and its magnitude would be 4 m regardless.\n\n===In physics and engineering===\nVectors are fundamental in the physical sciences. They can be used to represent any quantity that has magnitude, has direction, and which adheres to the rules of vector addition. An example is [[velocity]], the magnitude of which is [[speed]]. For example, the velocity ''5 meters per second upward'' could be represented by the vector (0,5) (in 2 dimensions with the positive ''y'' axis as 'up'). Another quantity represented by a vector is [[force]], since it has a magnitude and direction and follows the rules of vector addition. Vectors also describe many other physical quantities, such as linear displacement, [[displacement (vector)|displacement]], linear acceleration, [[angular acceleration]], [[linear momentum]], and [[angular momentum]]. Other physical vectors, such as the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]], are represented as a system of vectors at each point of a physical space; that is, a [[vector field]]. Examples of quantities that have magnitude and direction but fail to follow the rules of vector addition: Angular displacement and electric current. Consequently, these are not vectors.\n\n===In Cartesian space===\nIn the [[Cartesian coordinate system]], a vector can be represented by identifying the coordinates of its initial and terminal point. For instance, the points ''A'' = (1,0,0) and ''B'' = (0,1,0) in space determine the free vector <math>\\overrightarrow{AB}</math> pointing from the point ''x''=1 on the ''x''-axis to the point ''y''=1 on the ''y''-axis.\n\nTypically in Cartesian coordinates, one considers primarily bound vectors. A bound vector is determined by the coordinates of the terminal point, its initial point always having the coordinates of the origin ''O'' = (0,0,0). Thus the bound vector represented by (1,0,0) is a vector of unit length pointing from the origin along the positive ''x''-axis.\n\nThe coordinate representation of vectors allows the algebraic features of vectors to be expressed in a convenient numerical fashion. For example, the sum of the vectors (1,2,3) and (\u22122,0,4) is the vector\n:{{nowrap begin}}(1, 2, 3) + (\u22122, 0, 4) = (1 \u2212 2, 2 + 0, 3 + 4) = (\u22121, 2, 7).{{nowrap end}}\n\n===Euclidean and affine vectors===\nIn the geometrical and physical settings, sometimes it is possible to associate, in a natural way, a ''length'' or magnitude and a direction to vectors. In turn, the notion of direction is strictly associated with the notion of an ''angle'' between two vectors. When the length of vectors is defined, it is possible to also define a [[dot product]] \u2014 a scalar-valued product of two vectors \u2014 which gives a convenient algebraic characterization of both length (the square root of the dot product of a vector by itself) and angle (a function of the dot product between any two non-zero vectors). In three dimensions, it is further possible to define a [[cross product]] which supplies an algebraic characterization of the [[area]] and [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]] in space of the [[parallelogram]] defined by two vectors (used as sides of the parallelogram).\n\nHowever, it is not always possible or desirable to define the length of a vector in a natural way. This more general type of spatial vector is the subject of [[vector space]]s (for bound vectors) and [[affine space]]s (for free vectors). An important example is [[Minkowski space]] that is important to our understanding of [[special relativity]], where there is a generalization of length that permits non-zero vectors to have zero length. Other physical examples come from [[thermodynamics]], where many of the quantities of interest can be considered vectors in a space with no notion of length or angle.<ref name=\"thermo-forms\"\n>[http://www.av8n.com/physics/thermo-forms.htm Thermodynamics and Differential Forms]</ref>\n\n===Generalizations===\nIn physics, as well as mathematics, a vector is often identified with a [[tuple]] of components, or list of numbers, that act as scalar coefficients for a set of [[basis vector]]s. When the basis is transformed, for example by rotation or stretching, then the components of any vector in terms of that basis also transform in an opposite sense. The vector itself has not changed, but the basis has, so the components of the vector must change to compensate. The vector is called ''covariant'' or ''contravariant'' depending on how the transformation of the vector's components is related to the transformation of the basis. In general, contravariant vectors are \"regular vectors\" with units of distance (such as a displacement) or distance times some other unit (such as velocity or acceleration); covariant vectors, on the other hand, have units of one-over-distance such as [[gradient]]. If you change units (a special case of a change of basis) from meters to millimeters, a scale factor of 1/1000, a displacement of 1&nbsp;m becomes 1000&nbsp;mm\u2013a contravariant change in numerical value. In contrast, a gradient of 1&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]/m becomes 0.001&nbsp;K/mm\u2013a covariant change in value. See [[covariance and contravariance of vectors]]. [[Tensor]]s are another type of quantity that behave in this way; a vector is one type of [[tensor]].\n\nIn pure [[mathematics]], a vector is any element of a [[vector space]] over some [[field (mathematics)|field]] and is often represented as a [[coordinate vector]]. The vectors described in this article are a very special case of this general definition because they are contravariant with respect to the ambient space. Contravariance captures the physical intuition behind the idea that a vector has \"magnitude and direction\".\n\n==Representations==\n[[Image:vector from A to B.svg|right|200px|Vector arrow pointing from ''A'' to ''B'']]\n\nVectors are usually denoted in [[lowercase]] boldface, as '''a''' or lowercase italic boldface, as '''''a'''''. ([[Uppercase]] letters are typically used to represent [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]].) Other conventions include <math>\\vec{a}</math> or <u>''a''</u>, especially in handwriting. Alternatively, some use a [[tilde]] (~) or a wavy underline drawn beneath the symbol, e.g. <math>\\underset{^\\sim}a</math>, which is a convention for indicating boldface type. If the vector represents a directed [[distance]] or [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] from a point ''A'' to a point ''B'' (see figure), it can also be denoted as <math>\\overrightarrow{AB}</math> or <u>''AB''</u>. Especially in literature in [[German language|German]] it was common to represent vectors with small [[fraktur]] letters as <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math>.\n\nVectors are usually shown in graphs or other diagrams as arrows (directed [[line segment]]s), as illustrated in the figure. Here the point ''A'' is called the ''origin'', ''tail'', ''base'', or ''initial point''; point ''B'' is called the ''head'', ''tip'', ''endpoint'', ''terminal point'' or ''final point''. The length of the arrow is proportional to the vector's [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], while the direction in which the arrow points indicates the vector's direction.\n\n[[Image:Notation for vectors in or out of a plane.svg|right|200px]]\nOn a two-dimensional diagram, sometimes a vector [[perpendicular]] to the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of the diagram is desired. These vectors are commonly shown as small circles. A circle with a dot at its centre (Unicode U+2299 \u2299) indicates a vector pointing out of the front of the diagram, toward the viewer. A circle with a cross inscribed in it (Unicode U+2297 \u2297) indicates a vector pointing into and behind the diagram. These can be thought of as viewing the tip of an [[arrow (weapon)|arrow]] head on and viewing the flights of an arrow from the back.\n\n[[Image:Position vector.svg|thumb|right|A vector in the Cartesian plane, showing the position of a point ''A'' with coordinates (2,3).]]\n[[Image:3D Vector.svg|300px|right]]\nIn order to calculate with vectors, the graphical representation may be too cumbersome. Vectors in an ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space can be represented as [[coordinate vector]]s in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]]. The endpoint of a vector can be identified with an ordered list of ''n'' real numbers (''n''-[[tuple]]). These numbers are the [[Cartesian coordinate|coordinates]] of the endpoint of the vector, with respect to a given [[Cartesian coordinate system]], and are typically called the '''[[scalar component]]s''' (or '''scalar projections''') of the vector on the axes of the coordinate system.\n\nAs an example in two dimensions (see figure), the vector from the origin ''O'' = (0,0) to the point ''A'' = (2,3) is simply written as\n:<math>\\mathbf{a} = (2,3).</math>\n\nThe notion that the tail of the vector coincides with the origin is implicit and easily understood. Thus, the more explicit notation <math>\\overrightarrow{OA}</math> is usually not deemed necessary and very rarely used.\n\nIn ''three dimensional'' Euclidean space (or {{math|'''R'''<sup>''3''</sup>}}), vectors are identified with triples of scalar components:\n:<math>\\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, a_3).</math>\n:also written\n:<math>\\mathbf{a} = (a_\\text{x}, a_\\text{y}, a_\\text{z}).</math>\n\nThis can be generalised to ''n-dimensional'' Euclidean space (or {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}).\n:<math>\\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, a_3, \\cdots, a_{n-1}, a_n).</math>\n\nThese numbers are often arranged into a [[column vector]] or [[row vector]], particularly when dealing with [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], as follows:\n:<math>\\mathbf{a} =\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    a_1\\\\\n    a_2\\\\\n    a_3\\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix} =\n  [ a_1\\ a_2\\ a_3 ].\n</math>\n\nAnother way to represent a vector in ''n''-dimensions is to introduce the [[standard basis]] vectors. For instance, in three dimensions, there are three of them:\n:<math>{\\mathbf e}_1 = (1,0,0),\\ {\\mathbf e}_2 = (0,1,0),\\ {\\mathbf e}_3 = (0,0,1).</math>\nThese have the intuitive interpretation as vectors of unit length pointing up the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' axis of a [[Cartesian coordinate system]], respectively. In terms of these, any vector '''a''' in {{math|'''R'''<sup>''3''</sup>}} can be expressed in the form:\n:<math>\\mathbf{a} = (a_1,a_2,a_3) = a_1(1,0,0) + a_2(0,1,0) + a_3(0,0,1), \\ </math>\n\nor\n:<math>\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{a}_1 + \\mathbf{a}_2 + \\mathbf{a}_3 = a_1{\\mathbf e}_1 + a_2{\\mathbf e}_2 + a_3{\\mathbf e}_3,</math>\n\nwhere '''a'''<sub>1</sub>, '''a'''<sub>2</sub>, '''a'''<sub>3</sub> are called the '''[[vector component]]s''' (or '''vector projections''') of '''a''' on the basis vectors or, equivalently, on the corresponding Cartesian axes ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' (see figure), while ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, ''a''<sub>3</sub> are the respective [[scalar component]]s (or scalar projections).\n\nIn introductory physics textbooks, the standard basis vectors are often instead denoted <math>\\mathbf{i},\\mathbf{j},\\mathbf{k}</math> (or <math>\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}, \\mathbf{\\hat{y}}, \\mathbf{\\hat{z}}</math>, in which the [[hat symbol]] '''^''' typically denotes [[unit vector]]s). In this case, the scalar and vector components are denoted respectively ''a''<sub>x</sub>, ''a''<sub>y</sub>, ''a''<sub>z</sub>, and '''a'''<sub>x</sub>, '''a'''<sub>y</sub>, '''a'''<sub>z</sub> (note the difference in boldface). Thus,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{a}_\\text{x} + \\mathbf{a}_\\text{y} + \\mathbf{a}_\\text{z} = a_\\text{x}{\\mathbf i} + a_\\text{y}{\\mathbf j} + a_\\text{z}{\\mathbf k}.</math>\n\nThe notation '''e'''<sub>''i''</sub> is compatible with the [[index notation]] and the [[summation convention]] commonly used in higher level mathematics, physics, and engineering.\n\n=== {{anchor|Vector component|Decomposition}} Decomposition or resolution===\n{{details|Basis (linear algebra)}}\nAs explained [[Euclidean vector#Representations|above]] a vector is often described by a set of vector components that [[#Addition and subtraction|add up]] to form the given vector. Typically, these components are the [[Vector projection|projections]] of the vector on a set of mutually perpendicular reference axes (basis vectors). The vector is said to be ''decomposed'' or ''resolved with respect to'' that set.\n\n[[Image:Surface normal tangent.svg|right|thumb|Illustration of tangential and normal components of a vector to a surface.]]\n\nThe decomposition or resolution<ref>[[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs, J.W.]] (1901). ''Vector Analysis: A Text-book for the Use of Students of Mathematics and Physics, Founded upon the Lectures of J. Willard Gibbs'', by E.B. Wilson, Chares Scribner's Sons, New York, p. 15: \"Any vector {{math|'''r'''}} coplanar with two non-collinear vectors {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} may be resolved into two components parallel to {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} respectively. This resolution may be accomplished by constructing the parallelogram ...\"</ref> of a vector into components is not unique, because it depends on the choice of the axes on which the vector is projected.\n\nMoreover, the use of Cartesian unit vectors such as <math>\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}, \\mathbf{\\hat{y}}, \\mathbf{\\hat{z}}</math> as a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] in which to represent a vector is not mandated. Vectors can also be expressed in terms of an arbitrary basis, including the unit vectors of a [[cylindrical coordinate system]] (<math>\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\rho}}, \\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\phi}}, \\mathbf{\\hat{z}}</math>) or [[spherical coordinate system]] (<math>\\mathbf{\\hat{r}}, \\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\theta}}, \\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\phi}}</math>). The latter two choices are more convenient for solving problems which possess cylindrical or spherical symmetry respectively.\n\nThe choice of a basis doesn't affect the properties of a vector or its behaviour under transformations.\n\nA vector can also be broken up with respect to \"non-fixed\" basis vectors that change their [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]] as a function of time or space. For example, a vector in three-dimensional space can be decomposed with respect to two axes, respectively ''normal'', and ''tangent'' to a surface (see figure). Moreover, the ''radial'' and ''[[tangential component]]s'' of a vector relate to the ''[[radius]] of [[rotation]]'' of an object. The former is [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the radius and the latter is [[Perpendicular|orthogonal]] to it.<ref>[http://www.physics.uoguelph.ca/tutorials/torque/Q.torque.intro.angacc.html U. Guelph Physics Dept., \"Torque and Angular Acceleration\"]</ref>\n\nIn these cases, each of the components may be in turn decomposed with respect to a fixed coordinate system or basis set (e.g., a ''global'' coordinate system, or [[inertial reference frame]]).\n\n==Basic properties==\nThe following section uses the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] with basis vectors\n:<math>{\\mathbf e}_1 = (1,0,0),\\ {\\mathbf e}_2 = (0,1,0),\\ {\\mathbf e}_3 = (0,0,1)</math>\nand assumes that all vectors have the origin as a common base point. A vector '''a''' will be written as\n:<math>{\\mathbf a} = a_1{\\mathbf e}_1 + a_2{\\mathbf e}_2 + a_3{\\mathbf e}_3.</math>\n\n===Equality===\nTwo vectors are said to be equal if they have the same magnitude and direction. Equivalently they will be equal if their coordinates are equal. So two vectors\n:<math>{\\mathbf a} = a_1{\\mathbf e}_1 + a_2{\\mathbf e}_2 + a_3{\\mathbf e}_3</math>\nand\n:<math>{\\mathbf b} = b_1{\\mathbf e}_1 + b_2{\\mathbf e}_2 + b_3{\\mathbf e}_3</math>\nare equal if\n:<math>a_1 = b_1,\\quad a_2=b_2,\\quad a_3=b_3.\\,</math>\n\n===Opposite, parallel, and antiparallel vectors===\nTwo vectors are opposite if they have the same magnitude but opposite direction.

A vector of arbitrary length can be divided by its length to create a unit vector. This is known as ''normalizing'' a vector. A unit vector is often indicated with a hat as in '''\u00e2'''.\n\nTo normalize a vector {{nowrap|1='''a''' = [''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, ''a''<sub>3</sub>]}}, scale the vector by the reciprocal of its length \u2016'''a'''\u2016.

Written out in coordinates, the vector is {{nowrap|(0, 0, 0)}}, and it is commonly denoted <math>\\vec{0}</math>, '''0''', or simply 0. Unlike any other vector, it has an arbitrary or indeterminate direction, and cannot be normalized (that is, there is no unit vector that is a multiple of the zero vector). The sum of the zero vector with any vector '''a''' is '''a''' (that is, {{nowrap|1='''0''' + '''a''' = '''a'''}}).\n\n== Vector algebra==\n{{main|Vector algebra}}\n===Addition and subtraction===\n{{details|Vector space}}\nAssume now that '''a''' and '''b''' are not necessarily equal vectors, but that they may have different magnitudes and directions.

In the context of [[vector analysis|conventional vector algebra]], these real numbers are often called '''scalars''' (from ''scale'') to distinguish them from vectors. The operation of multiplying a vector by a scalar is called ''scalar multiplication''. The resulting vector is\n\n:<math>r\\mathbf{a}=(ra_1)\\mathbf{e}_1\n+(ra_2)\\mathbf{e}_2\n+(ra_3)\\mathbf{e}_3.</math>\n\nIntuitively, multiplying by a scalar ''r'' stretches a vector out by a factor of ''r''. Geometrically, this can be visualized (at least in the case when ''r'' is an integer) as placing ''r'' copies of the vector in a line where the endpoint of one vector is the initial point of the next vector.\n\nIf ''r'' is negative, then the vector changes direction: it flips around by an angle of 180\u00b0. Two examples (''r'' = \u22121 and ''r'' = 2) are given below:\n\n[[Image:Scalar multiplication of vectors2.svg|250px|thumb|left|The scalar multiplications \u2212'''a''' and 2'''a''' of a vector '''a''']]\n\n<!--\nThe set of all geometrical vectors, together with the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication, satisfies all the axioms of a [[vector space]]. Similarly, the set of all bound vectors with a common base point forms a vector space. This is where the term \"vector space\" originated.\n-->\n{{clear}}\n\n===Dot product===\n{{main article|Dot product}}\n\nThe ''dot product'' of two vectors '''a''' and '''b''' (sometimes called the ''[[inner product space|inner product]]'', or, since its result is a scalar, the ''scalar product'') is denoted by '''a'''&nbsp;\u2219&nbsp;'''b''' and is defined as:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}\n=\\left\\|\\mathbf{a}\\right\\|\\left\\|\\mathbf{b}\\right\\|\\cos\\theta</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b8'' is the measure of the [[angle]] between '''a''' and '''b''' (see [[trigonometric function]] for an explanation of cosine). Geometrically, this means that '''a''' and '''b''' are drawn with a common start point and then the length of '''a''' is multiplied with the length of that component of '''b''' that points in the same direction as '''a'''.\n\nThe dot product can also be defined as the sum of the products of the components of each vector as\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3.</math>\n\n===Cross product===\n{{main article|Cross product}}\n\nThe ''cross product'' (also called the ''vector product'' or ''outer product'') is only meaningful in three or [[Seven-dimensional cross product|seven]] dimensions. The cross product differs from the dot product primarily in that the result of the cross product of two vectors is a vector. The cross product, denoted '''a'''&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;'''b''', is a vector perpendicular to both '''a''' and '''b''' and is defined as\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{a}\\times\\mathbf{b}\n=\\left\\|\\mathbf{a}\\right\\|\\left\\|\\mathbf{b}\\right\\|\\sin(\\theta)\\,\\mathbf{n}</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b8'' is the measure of the angle between '''a''' and '''b''', and '''n''' is a unit vector [[perpendicular]] to both '''a''' and '''b''' which completes a [[Right hand rule|right-handed]] system. The right-handedness constraint is necessary because there exist ''two'' unit vectors that are perpendicular to both '''a''' and '''b''', namely, '''n''' and (\u2013'''n''').\n[[Image:Cross product vector.svg|thumb|right|An illustration of the cross product]]\n\nThe cross product '''a'''&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;'''b''' is defined so that '''a''', '''b''', and '''a'''&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;'''b''' also becomes a right-handed system (but note that '''a''' and '''b''' are not necessarily [[orthogonal]]). This is the [[right-hand rule]].\n\nThe length of '''a'''&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;'''b''' can be interpreted as the area of the parallelogram having '''a''' and '''b''' as sides.\n\nThe cross product can be written as\n:<math>{\\mathbf a}\\times{\\mathbf b} = (a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2) {\\mathbf e}_1 + (a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3) {\\mathbf e}_2 + (a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1) {\\mathbf e}_3.</math>\n\nFor arbitrary choices of spatial orientation (that is, allowing for left-handed as well as right-handed coordinate systems) the cross product of two vectors is a [[pseudovector]] instead of a vector (see below).\n\n==Conversion between multiple Cartesian bases==\nAll examples thus far have dealt with vectors expressed in terms of the same basis, namely, the ''e'' basis {'''e'''<sub>1</sub>, '''e'''<sub>2</sub>, '''e'''<sub>3</sub>}. However, a vector can be expressed in terms of any number of different bases that are not necessarily aligned with each other, and still remain the same vector.  In the ''e'' basis, a vector '''a''' is expressed, by definition, as\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{a} = p\\mathbf{e}_1 + q\\mathbf{e}_2 + r\\mathbf{e}_3</math>.\n\nThe scalar components in the ''e'' basis are, by definition,\n\n:<math>p = \\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_1</math>, \n:<math>q = \\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_2</math>, \n:<math>r = \\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_3</math>.\n\nIn another orthnormal basis ''n'' = {'''n'''<sub>1</sub>, '''n'''<sub>2</sub>, '''n'''<sub>3</sub>} that is not necessarily aligned with ''e'', the vector '''a''' is expressed as\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{a} = u\\mathbf{n}_1 + v\\mathbf{n}_2 + w\\mathbf{n}_3</math>\n\nand the scalar components in the ''n'' basis are, by definition,\n\n:<math>u = \\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_1</math>,\n:<math>v = \\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_2</math>,\n:<math>w = \\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_3</math>.\n\nThe values of ''p'', ''q'', ''r'', and ''u'', ''v'', ''w'' relate to the unit vectors in such a way that the resulting vector sum is exactly the same physical vector '''a''' in both cases.  It is common to encounter vectors known in terms of different bases (for example, one basis fixed to the Earth and a second basis fixed to a moving vehicle).  In such a case it is necessary to develop a method to convert between bases so the basic vector operations such as addition and subtraction can be performed.  One way to express ''u'', ''v'', ''w'' in terms of ''p'', ''q'', ''r'' is to use column matrices along with a [[direction cosine matrix]] containing the information that relates the two bases.  Such an expression can be formed by substitution of the above equations to form\n\n:<math>u = (p\\mathbf{e}_1 + q\\mathbf{e}_2 + r\\mathbf{e}_3)\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_1</math>,\n:<math>v = (p\\mathbf{e}_1 + q\\mathbf{e}_2 + r\\mathbf{e}_3)\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_2</math>,\n:<math>w = (p\\mathbf{e}_1 + q\\mathbf{e}_2 + r\\mathbf{e}_3)\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_3</math>.\n\nDistributing the dot-multiplication gives\n\n:<math>u = p\\mathbf{e}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_1 + q\\mathbf{e}_2\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_1 + r\\mathbf{e}_3\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_1</math>,\n:<math>v = p\\mathbf{e}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_2 + q\\mathbf{e}_2\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_2 + r\\mathbf{e}_3\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_2</math>,\n:<math>w = p\\mathbf{e}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_3 + q\\mathbf{e}_2\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_3 + r\\mathbf{e}_3\\cdot\\mathbf{n}_3</math>.\n\nReplacing each dot product with a unique scalar gives\n\n:<math>u = c_{11}p + c_{12}q + c_{13}r</math>,\n:<math>v = c_{21}p + c_{22}q + c_{23}r</math>,\n:<math>w = c_{31}p + c_{32}q + c_{33}r</math>,\n\nand these equations can be expressed as the single matrix equation\n\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix} u \\\\ v \\\\ w \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} c_{11} & c_{12} & c_{13} \\\\ c_{21} & c_{22} & c_{23} \\\\ c_{31} & c_{32} & c_{33} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} p \\\\ q \\\\ r \\end{bmatrix} </math>.\n\nThis matrix equation relates the scalar components of '''a''' in the ''n'' basis (''u'',''v'', and ''w'') with those in the ''e'' basis (''p'', ''q'', and ''r'').  Each matrix element ''c''<sub>''jk''</sub> is the [[Direction cosine#Cartesian coordinates|direction cosine]] relating '''n'''<sub>''j''</sub> to '''e'''<sub>''k''</sub>.<ref name=\"dynon16\">{{harvnb|Kane|Levinson|1996|pp=20\u201322}}</ref> The term ''direction cosine'' refers to the [[cosine]] of the angle between two unit vectors, which is also equal to their [[#Dot product|dot product]].<ref name=\"dynon16\"/> Therefore,\n\n:<math>c_{11} = \\mathbf{n}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_1</math>\n:<math>c_{12} = \\mathbf{n}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_2</math>\n:<math>c_{13} = \\mathbf{n}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_3</math>\n:<math>c_{21} = \\mathbf{n}_2\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_1</math>\n:<math>c_{22} = \\mathbf{n}_2\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_2</math>\n:<math>c_{23} = \\mathbf{n}_2\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_3</math>\n:<math>c_{31} = \\mathbf{n}_3\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_1</math>\n:<math>c_{32} = \\mathbf{n}_3\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_2</math>\n:<math>c_{33} = \\mathbf{n}_3\\cdot\\mathbf{e}_3</math>\n\nBy referring collectively to '''e'''<sub>1</sub>, '''e'''<sub>2</sub>, '''e'''<sub>3</sub> as the ''e'' basis and to '''n'''<sub>1</sub>, '''n'''<sub>2</sub>, '''n'''<sub>3</sub> as the ''n'' basis, the matrix containing all the ''c''<sub>''jk''</sub> is known as the \"'''[[transformation matrix]]''' from ''e'' to ''n''\", or the \"'''[[rotation matrix]]''' from ''e'' to ''n''\" (because it can be imagined as the \"rotation\" of a vector from one basis to another), or the \"'''direction cosine matrix''' from ''e'' to ''n''\"<ref name=\"dynon16\"/> (because it contains direction cosines).  The properties of a [[rotation matrix]] are such that its [[matrix inverse|inverse]] is equal to its [[matrix transpose|transpose]]. This means that the \"rotation matrix from ''e'' to ''n''\" is the transpose of \"rotation matrix from ''n'' to ''e''\".\n\nThe advantage of this method is that a direction cosine matrix can usually be obtained independently by using [[Euler angles]] or a [[quaternion]] to relate the two vector bases, so the basis conversions can be performed directly, without having to work out all the dot products described above.\n\nBy applying several matrix multiplications in succession, any vector can be expressed in any basis so long as the set of direction cosines is known relating the successive bases.<ref name=\"dynon16\"/>\n\n==Physics==\nVectors have many uses in physics and other sciences.\n\n===Length and units===\nIn abstract vector spaces, the length of the arrow depends on a [[Dimensionless number|dimensionless]] [[Scale (measurement)|scale]]. If it represents, for example, a force, the \"scale\" is of [[Dimensional analysis|physical dimension]] length/force. Thus there is typically consistency in scale among quantities of the same dimension, but otherwise scale ratios may vary; for example, if \"1 newton\" and \"5 m\" are both represented with an arrow of 2&nbsp;cm, the scales are 1:250 and 1 m:50 N respectively. Equal length of vectors of different dimension has no particular significance unless there is some [[proportionality constant]] inherent in the system that the diagram represents. Also length of a unit vector (of dimension length, not length/force, etc.) has no coordinate-system-invariant significance.\n\n===Vector-valued functions===\n{{main article|Vector-valued function}}\nOften in areas of physics and mathematics, a vector evolves in time, meaning that it depends on a time parameter ''t''. For instance, if '''r''' represents the position vector of a particle, then '''r'''(''t'') gives a [[parametric equation|parametric]] representation of the trajectory of the particle. Vector-valued functions can be [[derivative|differentiated]] and [[integral|integrated]] by differentiating or integrating the components of the vector, and many of the familiar rules from [[calculus]] continue to hold for the derivative and integral of vector-valued functions.\n\n===Position, velocity and acceleration===\nThe position of a point '''x''' = (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>) in three-dimensional space can be represented as a [[position vector]] whose base point is the origin\n:<math>{\\mathbf x} = x_1 {\\mathbf e}_1 + x_2{\\mathbf e}_2 + x_3{\\mathbf e}_3.</math>\nThe position vector has dimensions of [[length]].\n\nGiven two points '''x''' = (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>), '''y''' = (''y''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>2</sub>, ''y''<sub>3</sub>) their [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] is a vector\n:<math>{\\mathbf y}-{\\mathbf x}=(y_1-x_1){\\mathbf e}_1 + (y_2-x_2){\\mathbf e}_2 + (y_3-x_3){\\mathbf e}_3.</math>\nwhich specifies the position of ''y'' relative to ''x''. The length of this vector gives the straight-line distance from ''x'' to ''y''. Displacement has the dimensions of length.\n\nThe [[velocity]] '''v''' of a point or particle is a vector, its length gives the [[speed]]. For constant velocity the position at time ''t'' will be\n:<math>{\\mathbf x}_t= t {\\mathbf v} + {\\mathbf x}_0,</math>\nwhere '''x'''<sub>0</sub> is the position at time ''t''=0. Velocity is the [[Euclidean vector#Ordinary derivative|time derivative]] of position. Its dimensions are length/time.\n\n[[Acceleration]] '''a''' of a point is vector which is the [[Euclidean vector#Ordinary derivative|time derivative]] of velocity. Its dimensions are length/time<sup>2</sup>.\n\n===Force, energy, work===\n[[Force]] is a vector with dimensions of mass\u00d7length/time<sup>2</sup> and [[Newton's second law]] is the scalar multiplication\n:<math>{\\mathbf F} = m{\\mathbf a}</math>\n\nWork is the dot product of [[force]] and [[displacement (vector)|displacement]]\n:<math>E = {\\mathbf F} \\cdot ({\\mathbf x}_2 - {\\mathbf x}_1).</math>\n<!--\nIn physics, scalars may also have a unit of measurement associated with them. For instance, [[Newton's second law]] is\n:<math>{\\mathbf F} = m{\\mathbf a}</math>\nwhere '''F''' has units of force, '''a''' has units of acceleration, and the scalar ''m'' has units of mass. In one possible physical interpretation of the above diagram, the scale of acceleration is, for instance, 2 m/s<sup>2</sup> : cm, and that of force 5 N : cm. Thus a scale ratio of 2.5 kg : 1 is used for mass. Similarly, if displacement has a scale of 1:1000 and velocity of 0.2 cm : 1 m/s, or equivalently, 2 ms : 1, a scale ratio of 0.5 : s is used for time.\n-->\n\n==Vectors as directional derivatives==\nA vector may also be defined as a ''[[directional derivative]]'': consider a [[function (mathematics)|function]] <math>f(x^\\alpha)</math> and a curve <math>x^\\alpha (\\tau)</math>. Then the directional derivative of <math>f</math> is a scalar defined as\n\n:<math>\\frac{df}{d\\tau} = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^n \\frac{dx^\\alpha}{d\\tau}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^\\alpha}.</math>\n\nwhere the index <math>\\alpha</math> is [[Summation convention|summed over]] the appropriate number of dimensions (for example, from 1 to 3 in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, from 0 to 3 in 4-dimensional spacetime, etc.). Then consider a vector tangent to <math>x^\\alpha (\\tau)</math>:\n\n:<math>t^\\alpha = \\frac{dx^\\alpha}{d\\tau}.</math>\n\nThe directional derivative can be rewritten in differential form (without a given function <math>f</math>) as\n\n:<math>\\frac{d}{d\\tau} = \\sum_\\alpha t^\\alpha\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\alpha}.</math>\n\nTherefore, any directional derivative can be identified with a corresponding vector, and any vector can be identified with a corresponding directional derivative. A vector can therefore be defined precisely as\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{a} \\equiv a^\\alpha \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\alpha}.</math>\n\n==Vectors, pseudovectors, and transformations==\nAn alternative characterization of Euclidean vectors, especially in physics, describes them as lists of quantities which behave in a certain way under a [[coordinate system|coordinate transformation]]. A ''contravariant vector'' is required to have components that \"transform opposite to the basis\" under changes of [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. The vector itself does not change when the basis is transformed; instead, the components of the vector make a change that cancels the change in the basis. In other words, if the reference axes (and the basis derived from it) were rotated in one direction, the component representation of the vector would rotate in the opposite way to generate the same final vector. Similarly, if the reference axes were stretched in one direction, the components of the vector would reduce in an exactly compensating way. Mathematically, if the basis undergoes a transformation described by an [[invertible matrix]] ''M'', so that a coordinate vector '''x''' is transformed to {{nowrap|1='''x'''\u2032 = ''M'''''x'''}}, then a contravariant vector '''v''' must be similarly transformed via {{nowrap|1='''v'''\u2032 = ''M'''''v'''}}. This important requirement is what distinguishes a contravariant vector from any other triple of physically meaningful quantities. For example, if ''v'' consists of the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z''-components of [[velocity]], then ''v'' is a contravariant vector: if the coordinates of space are stretched, rotated, or twisted, then the components of the velocity transform in the same way. On the other hand, for instance, a triple consisting of the length, width, and height of a rectangular box could make up the three components of an abstract [[vector space|vector]], but this vector would not be contravariant, since rotating the box does not change the box's length, width, and height. Examples of contravariant vectors include [[displacement (vector)|displacement]], [[velocity]], [[electric field]], [[momentum]], [[force]], and [[acceleration]].\n\nIn the language of [[differential geometry]], the requirement that the components of a vector transform according to the same matrix of the coordinate transition is equivalent to defining a ''contravariant vector'' to be a [[tensor]] of [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] rank one. Alternatively, a contravariant vector is defined to be a [[tangent space|tangent vector]], and the rules for transforming a contravariant vector follow from the [[chain rule]].\n\nSome vectors transform like contravariant vectors, except that when they are reflected through a mirror, they flip ''and'' gain a minus sign. A transformation that switches right-handedness to left-handedness and vice versa like a mirror does is said to change the ''[[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]]'' of space. A vector which gains a minus sign when the orientation of space changes is called a ''[[pseudovector]]'' or an ''axial vector''. Ordinary vectors are sometimes called ''true vectors'' or ''polar vectors'' to distinguish them from pseudovectors. Pseudovectors occur most frequently as the [[cross product]] of two ordinary vectors.\n\nOne example of a pseudovector is [[angular velocity]]. Driving in a [[car]], and looking forward, each of the [[wheel]]s has an angular velocity vector pointing to the left. If the world is reflected in a mirror which switches the left and right side of the car, the ''reflection'' of this angular velocity vector points to the right, but the ''actual'' angular velocity vector of the wheel still points to the left, corresponding to the minus sign. Other examples of pseudovectors include [[magnetic field]], [[torque]], or more generally any cross product of two (true) vectors.\n\nThis distinction between vectors and pseudovectors is often ignored, but it becomes important in studying [[symmetry]] properties.
