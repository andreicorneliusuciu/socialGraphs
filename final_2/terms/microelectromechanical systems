It merges at the nano-scale into [[nanoelectromechanical systems]] (NEMS) and [[nanotechnology]]. MEMS are also referred to as [[Micromachinery|micromachines]] in Japan, or ''micro systems technology'' (''MST'') in Europe.\n\nMEMS are separate and distinct from the hypothetical vision of [[molecular nanotechnology]] or [[molecular electronics]]. MEMS are made up of components between 1 and 100 micrometres in size (i.e. 0.001 to 0.1&nbsp;mm), and MEMS devices generally range in size from 20 micrometres to a millimetre (i.e. 0.02 to 1.0&nbsp;mm). They usually consist of a central unit that processes data (the microprocessor) and several components that interact with the surroundings such as microsensors.<ref>{{cite book |last = Waldner  |first = Jean-Baptiste| author-link = Jean-Baptiste Waldner | title = Nanocomputers and Swarm Intelligence |publisher = [[ISTE Ltd|ISTE]] [[John Wiley & Sons]] |place = London |year = 2008 |page = 205 |isbn = 1-84821-009-4}}</ref> At these size scales, the standard constructs of [[classical physics]] are not always sufficient.

The [[economies of scale]], ready availability of inexpensive high-quality materials, and ability to incorporate electronic functionality make silicon attractive for a wide variety of MEMS applications.\nSilicon also has significant advantages engendered through its material properties.  In single crystal form, silicon is an almost perfect [[Hooke's law|Hookean]] material, meaning that when it is flexed there is virtually no [[hysteresis]] and hence almost no energy dissipation.  As well as making for highly repeatable motion, this also makes silicon very reliable as it suffers very little [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] and can have service lifetimes in the range of [[1000000000 (number)|billions]] to [[1000000000000 (number)|trillions]] of cycles without breaking.\n\n===Polymers===\nEven though the electronics industry provides an economy of scale for the silicon industry, crystalline silicon is still a complex and relatively expensive material to produce.  Polymers on the other hand can be produced in huge volumes, with a great variety of material characteristics.  MEMS devices can be made from polymers by processes such as [[injection molding]], [[Embossing (manufacturing)|embossing]] or [[stereolithography]] and are especially well suited to [[microfluidic]] applications such as disposable blood testing cartridges.\n\n===Metals===\nMetals can also be used to create MEMS elements.  While metals do not have some of the advantages displayed by silicon in terms of mechanical properties, when used within their limitations, metals can exhibit very high degrees of reliability. Metals can be deposited by electroplating, evaporation, and sputtering processes. Commonly used metals include [[gold]], [[nickel]], [[aluminium]], [[copper]], [[chromium]], [[titanium]], [[tungsten]], [[platinum]], and [[silver]].\n\n===Ceramics===\nThe [[nitride]]s of silicon, aluminium and titanium as well as [[silicon carbide]] and other [[ceramic]]s are increasingly applied in MEMS fabrication due to advantageous combinations of material properties. [[aluminium nitride|AlN]] crystallizes in the [[wurtzite structure]] and thus shows [[pyroelectricity|pyroelectric]] and [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] properties enabling sensors, for instance, with sensitivity to normal and shear forces.<ref name= PC2009>{{cite journal |author1=T.

There are two types of deposition processes, as follows.\n\n====Physical deposition====\nPhysical vapor deposition (\"PVD\") consists of a process in which a material is removed from a target, and deposited on a surface.  Techniques to do this include the process of [[sputtering]], in which an ion beam liberates atoms from a target, allowing them to move through the intervening space and deposit on the desired substrate, and  [[Evaporation (deposition)|evaporation]], in which a material is evaporated from a target using either heat (thermal evaporation) or an electron beam (e-beam evaporation) in a vacuum system.\n\n====Chemical deposition====\nChemical deposition techniques include chemical vapor deposition (\"CVD\"), in which a stream of source gas reacts on the substrate to grow the material desired.  This can be further divided into categories depending on the details of the technique, for example, [[LPCVD]] (Low Pressure chemical vapor deposition) and [[PECVD]] (Plasma Enhanced chemical vapor deposition).\n\nOxide films can also be grown by the technique of [[thermal oxidation]], in which the (typically silicon) wafer is exposed to oxygen and/or steam, to grow a thin surface layer of [[silicon dioxide]].\n\n===Patterning===\nPatterning in MEMS is the transfer of a pattern into a material.\n\n====Lithography====\nLithography in MEMS context is typically the transfer of a pattern into a photosensitive material by selective exposure to a radiation source such as light. A photosensitive material is a material that experiences a change in its physical properties when exposed to a radiation source. If a photosensitive material is selectively exposed to radiation (e.g. by masking some of the radiation) the pattern of the radiation on the material is transferred to the material exposed, as the properties of the exposed and unexposed regions differs.\n\nThis exposed region can then be removed or treated providing a mask for the underlying substrate.  [[Photolithography]] is typically used with metal or other thin film deposition, wet and dry etching.\n\n====Electron beam lithography====\n\n{{Main|Electron beam lithography}}\nElectron beam lithography (often abbreviated as e-beam lithography) is the practice of scanning a beam of [[electron]]s in a patterned fashion across a surface covered with a film (called the [[resist]]),<ref name=\"mccord\">{{cite book |last= McCord |first=M. A. |author2=M. J. Rooks |title=SPIE Handbook of Microlithography, Micromachining and Microfabrication|year=2000 |chapter=2|url=http://www.cnf.cornell.edu/cnf_spietoc.html}}</ref> (\"exposing\" the resist) and of selectively removing either exposed or non-exposed regions of the resist (\"developing\"). The purpose, as with [[photolithography]], is to create very small structures in the resist that can subsequently be transferred to the substrate material, often by etching. It was developed for manufacturing [[integrated circuit]]s, and is also used for creating [[nanotechnology]] architectures.\n\nThe primary advantage of electron beam lithography is that it is one of the ways to beat the [[diffraction limit]] of light and make features in the [[nanometer]] region.  This form of [[maskless lithography]] has found wide usage in [[photomask]]-making used in [[photolithography]], low-volume production of semiconductor components, and research & development.\n\nThe key limitation of electron beam lithography is throughput, i.e., the very long time it takes to expose an entire silicon wafer or glass substrate. A long exposure time leaves the user vulnerable to beam drift or instability which may occur during the exposure. Also, the turn-around time for reworking or re-design is lengthened unnecessarily if the pattern is not being changed the second time.\n\n====Ion beam lithography====\n\nIt  is  known  that  focused-[[ion beam lithography]] has the  capability  of  writing extremely  fine  lines  (less than 50&nbsp;nm line and space has been achieved) without proximity effect.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} However, because the writing field in ion-beam lithography is quite small, large area patterns must be created by stitching together the small fields.\n\n====Ion track technology====\n\n[[Ion track technology]] is a deep cutting tool with a resolution limit around 8&nbsp;nm applicable to radiation resistant minerals, glasses and polymers. It is capable to generate holes in thin films without any development process. Structural depth can be defined either by ion range or by material thickness. Aspect ratios up to several 10<sup>4</sup> can be reached. The technique can shape and texture materials at a defined inclination angle. Random pattern, single-ion track structures and aimed pattern consisting of individual single tracks can be generated.\n\n====X-ray lithography====\n\n[[X-ray lithography]] is a process used in electronic industry to selectively remove parts of a thin film. It uses X-rays to transfer a geometric pattern from a mask to a light-sensitive chemical photoresist, or simply \"resist,\" on the substrate. A series of chemical treatments then engraves the produced pattern into the material underneath the photoresist.\n\n====Diamond patterning====\nA simple way to carve or create  patterns on the surface of nanodiamonds without damaging them could lead to a new photonic devices.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nDiamond patterning is a method of forming diamond MEMS.  It is achieved by the lithographic application of diamond films to a substrate such as silicon.  The patterns can be formed by selective deposition through a silicon dioxide mask, or by deposition followed by micromachining or focused [[Ion milling machine|ion beam milling]].<ref>Marc J. Madou, ''Fundamentals of Microfabrication and Nanotechnology, Volume III: From MEMS to Bio-MEMS and Bio-NEMS: Manufacturing Techniques and Applications'', p. 252, CRC Press, 2011 ISBN 1439895244.</ref>\n\n===Etching processes===\nThere are two basic categories of etching processes: [[Etching (microfabrication)|wet etching]] and [[dry etching]].\nIn the former, the material is dissolved when immersed in a chemical solution.\nIn the latter, the material is sputtered or dissolved using reactive ions or a vapor phase etchant.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/84.546406|title=Etch rates for micromachining processing|year=1996|last1=Williams|first1=K.R.|last2=Muller|first2=R.S.|journal=Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems|volume=5|page=256|issue=4}}</ref><ref name=\"bulk\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/5.704259|title=Bulk micromachining of silicon|year=1998|last1=Kovacs|first1=G.T.A.|last2=Maluf|first2=N.I.|last3=Petersen|first3=K.E.|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|volume=86|page=1536|issue=8}}</ref>\n\n====Wet etching====\n{{main|Etching (microfabrication)}}\n\nWet chemical etching consists in selective removal of material by dipping a substrate into a solution that dissolves it. The chemical nature of this etching process provides a good selectivity, which means the etching rate of the target material is considerably higher than the mask material if selected carefully.\n\n=====Isotropic etching=====\nEtching progresses at the same speed in all directions. Long and narrow holes in a mask will produce v-shaped grooves in the silicon.  The surface of these grooves can be atomically smooth if the etch is carried out correctly, with dimensions and angles being extremely accurate.\n\n=====Anisotropic etching=====\nSome single crystal materials, such as silicon, will have different etching rates depending on the crystallographic orientation of the substrate. This is known as anisotropic etching and one of the most common examples is the etching of silicon in KOH (potassium hydroxide), where Si <111> planes etch approximately 100 times slower than other planes ([[crystallography|crystallographic orientations]]). Therefore, etching a rectangular hole in a (100)-Si wafer results in a pyramid shaped etch pit with 54.7\u00b0 walls, instead of a hole with curved sidewalls as with isotropic etching.\n\n=====HF etching=====\n[[Hydrofluoric acid]] is commonly used as an aqueous etchant for silicon dioxide ({{chem|SiO|2}}, also known as BOX for SOI), usually in 49% concentrated form, 5:1, 10:1 or 20:1 BOE ([[buffered oxide etch]]ant) or BHF (Buffered HF). They were first used in medieval times for glass etching. It was used in IC fabrication for patterning the gate oxide until the process step was replaced by RIE.\n\nHydrofluoric acid is considered one of the more dangerous acids in the [[cleanroom]]. It penetrates the skin upon contact and it diffuses straight to the bone. Therefore, the damage is not felt until it is too late.\n\n=====Electrochemical etching=====\nElectrochemical etching (ECE) for dopant-selective removal of silicon is a common method to automate and to selectively control etching.  An active p-n [[diode]] junction is required, and either type of dopant can be the etch-resistant (\"etch-stop\") material.  Boron is the most common etch-stop dopant.  In combination with wet anisotropic etching as described above, ECE has been used successfully for controlling silicon diaphragm thickness in commercial piezoresistive silicon pressure sensors.  Selectively doped regions can be created either by implantation, diffusion, or epitaxial deposition of silicon.\n\n====Dry etching====\n\n=====Vapor etching=====\n\n======Xenon difluoride======\n[[Xenon difluoride]] ({{chem|XeF|2}}) is a dry vapor phase isotropic etch for silicon originally applied for MEMS in 1995 at University of California, Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite book|doi=10.1117/12.220933|title=Gas-phase silicon micromachining with xenon difluoride|year=1995|last1=Chang|first1=Floy I.|page=117|volume=2641|chapter=Gas-phase silicon micromachining with xenon difluoride|series=Microelectronic Structures and Microelectromechanical Devices for Optical Processing and Multimedia Applications}}</ref><ref>{{Cite thesis |type=M.S. |title=Xenon difluoride etching of silicon for MEMS |last=Chang |first=Floy I-Jung |year=1995 |publisher=University of California |location=Los Angeles |oclc=34531873 }}</ref> Primarily used for releasing metal and dielectric structures by undercutting silicon, {{chem|XeF|2}} has the advantage of a [[stiction]]-free release unlike wet etchants.  Its etch selectivity to silicon is very high, allowing it to work with photoresist, {{chem|SiO|2}}, silicon nitride, and various metals for masking.  Its reaction to silicon is \"plasmaless\", is purely chemical and spontaneous and is often operated in pulsed mode.  Models of the etching action are available,<ref>{{cite book|doi=10.1109/MEMS.2004.1290690|year=2004|last1=Brazzle|first1=J.D.|last2=Dokmeci|title=17th IEEE International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems.

Plasma etchers can operate in several modes by adjusting the parameters of the plasma. Ordinary plasma etching operates between 0.1 and 5 Torr. (This unit of pressure, commonly used in vacuum engineering, equals approximately 133.3 pascals.) The plasma produces energetic free radicals, neutrally charged, that react at the surface of the wafer. Since neutral particles attack the wafer from all angles, this process is isotropic.\n\nPlasma etching can be isotropic, i.e., exhibiting a lateral undercut rate on a patterned surface approximately the same as its downward etch rate, or can be anisotropic, i.e., exhibiting a smaller lateral undercut rate than its downward etch rate. Such anisotropy is maximized in deep reactive ion etching. The use of the term anisotropy for plasma etching should not be conflated with the use of the same term when referring to orientation-dependent etching.\n\nThe source gas for the plasma usually contains small molecules rich in chlorine or fluorine. For instance, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) etches silicon and aluminium, and trifluoromethane etches silicon dioxide and silicon nitride. A plasma containing oxygen is used to oxidize (\"ash\") photoresist and facilitate its removal.\n\nIon milling, or sputter etching, uses lower pressures, often as low as 10\u22124 Torr (10 mPa). It bombards the wafer with energetic ions of noble gases, often Ar+, which knock atoms from the substrate by transferring momentum. Because the etching is performed by ions, which approach the wafer approximately from one direction, this process is highly anisotropic. On the other hand, it tends to display poor selectivity. Reactive-ion etching (RIE) operates under conditions intermediate between sputter and plasma etching (between 10\u20133 and 10\u22121 Torr). Deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE) modifies the RIE technique to produce deep, narrow features.\n\n======Sputtering======\n\n======Reactive ion etching (RIE)======\n{{main|Reactive-ion etching}}\n\nIn reactive-ion etching (RIE), the substrate is placed inside a reactor, and several gases are introduced. A plasma is struck in the gas mixture using an RF power source, which breaks the gas molecules into ions. The ions accelerate towards, and react with, the surface of the material being etched, forming another gaseous material. This is known as the chemical part of reactive ion etching. There is also a physical part, which is similar to the sputtering deposition process. If the ions have high enough energy, they can knock atoms out of the material to be etched without a chemical reaction. It is a very complex task to develop dry etch processes that balance chemical and physical etching, since there are many parameters to adjust. By changing the balance it is possible to influence the anisotropy of the etching, since the chemical part is isotropic and the physical part highly anisotropic the combination can form sidewalls that have shapes from rounded to vertical.\n{{main|Deep reactive ion etching}}\n\nDeep RIE (DRIE) is a special subclass of RIE that is growing in popularity. In this process, etch depths of hundreds of micrometres are achieved with almost vertical sidewalls. The primary technology is based on the so-called \"Bosch process\",<ref>{{cite book|doi=10.1109/SENSOR.2005.1497272|year=2005|last1=Laermer|first1=F.|last2=Urban|title=The 13th International Conference on Solid-State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems, 2005.

TRANSDUCERS '05|first2=A.|page=1118|volume=2|chapter=Milestones in deep reactive ion etching|isbn=0-7803-8994-8}}</ref> named after the German company Robert Bosch, which filed the original patent, where two different gas compositions alternate in the reactor. Currently there are two variations of the DRIE. The first variation consists of three distinct steps (the original Bosch process) while the second variation only consists of two steps.<br />\nIn the first variation, the etch cycle is as follows:<br />\n(i) {{chem|SF|6}} isotropic etch;<br />\n(ii) {{chem|C|4|F|8}} passivation;<br />\n(iii) {{chem|SF|6}} anisoptropic etch for floor cleaning.<br />\nIn the 2nd variation, steps (i) and (iii) are combined.\n\nBoth variations operate similarly.\nThe {{chem|C|4|F|8}} creates a polymer on the surface of the substrate, and the second gas composition ({{chem|SF|6}} and {{chem|O|2}}) etches the substrate. The polymer is immediately sputtered away by the physical part of the etching, but only on the horizontal surfaces and not the sidewalls. Since the polymer only dissolves very slowly in the chemical part of the etching, it builds up on the sidewalls and protects them from etching. As a result, etching aspect ratios of 50 to 1 can be achieved. The process can easily be used to etch completely through a silicon substrate, and etch rates are 3\u20136 times higher than wet etching.\n\n===Die preparation===\nAfter preparing a large number of MEMS devices on a [[wafer (electronics)|silicon wafer]], individual [[die (integrated circuit)|dies]] have to be separated, which is called [[die preparation]] in semiconductor technology. For some applications, the separation is preceded by [[wafer backgrinding]] in order to reduce the wafer thickness. [[Wafer dicing]] may then be performed either by sawing using a cooling liquid or a dry laser process called [[wafer dicing#Stealth dicing|stealth dicing]].\n\n==MEMS manufacturing technologies==\n\n===Bulk micromachining===\n{{main|Bulk micromachining}}\n\nBulk micromachining is the oldest paradigm of silicon based MEMS. The whole thickness of a silicon wafer is used for building the micro-mechanical structures.<ref name=\"bulk\"/> Silicon is machined using various [[#Etching processes|etching processes]]. [[Anodic bonding]] of glass plates or additional silicon wafers is used for adding features in the third dimension and for hermetic encapsulation. Bulk micromachining has been essential in enabling high performance [[pressure sensor]]s and [[accelerometer]]s that changed the sensor industry in the 1980s and 90's.\n\n===Surface micromachining===\n{{main|Surface micromachining}}\n\nSurface micromachining uses layers deposited on the surface of a substrate as the structural materials, rather than using the substrate itself.<ref name=\"surface\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Bustillo | first1 = J.

The original surface micromachining concept was based on thin polycrystalline silicon layers patterned as movable mechanical structures and released by sacrificial etching of the underlying oxide layer. Interdigital comb electrodes were used to produce in-plane forces and to detect in-plane movement capacitively. This MEMS paradigm has enabled the manufacturing of low cost [[accelerometer]]s for e.g. automotive air-bag systems and other applications where low performance and/or high g-ranges are sufficient. [[Analog Devices]] has pioneered the industrialization of surface micromachining and has realized the co-integration of MEMS and integrated circuits.\n\n===High aspect ratio (HAR) silicon micromachining===\nBoth bulk and surface silicon micromachining are used in the industrial production of sensors, ink-jet nozzles, and other devices. But in many cases the distinction between these two has diminished. A new etching technology, [[deep reactive-ion etching]], has made it possible to combine good performance typical of [[bulk micromachining]] with comb structures and in-plane operation typical of [[surface micromachining]]. While it is common in surface micromachining to have structural layer thickness in the range of 2&nbsp;\u00b5m, in HAR silicon micromachining the thickness can be from 10 to 100&nbsp;\u00b5m. The materials commonly used in HAR silicon micromachining are thick polycrystalline silicon, known as epi-poly, and bonded silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers although processes for bulk silicon wafer also have been created (SCREAM). Bonding a second wafer by glass frit bonding, anodic bonding or alloy bonding is used to protect the MEMS structures. Integrated circuits are typically not combined with HAR silicon micromachining.\n\n[[File:Labonachip20017-300.jpg|thumb|Microelectromechanical systems chip, sometimes called \"lab on a chip\"]]\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:DLP CINEMA.

Larger firms specialize in manufacturing high volume inexpensive components or packaged solutions for end markets such as automobiles, biomedical, and electronics.  Smaller firms provide value in innovative solutions and absorb the expense of custom fabrication with high sales margins. Both large and small companies typically invest in [[R&D]] to explore new MEMS technology.\n\nThe market for materials and equipment used to manufacture MEMS devices topped $1 billion worldwide in 2006. Materials demand is driven by substrates, making up over 70 percent of the market, packaging coatings and increasing use of chemical mechanical planarization (CMP). While MEMS manufacturing continues to be dominated by used semiconductor equipment, there is a migration to 200&nbsp;mm lines and select new tools, including etch and bonding for certain MEMS applications.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Brain\u2013computer interface]]\n*[[Cantilever (microtechnology)|Cantilever]] - one of the most common forms of MEMS.\n*[[Electrostatic motor]]s used where coils are difficult to fabricate\n*[[Kelvin probe force microscope]]\n*[[MEMS sensor generations]]\n*[[MEMS thermal actuator]], MEMS actuation created by thermal expansion\n*[[Micro-opto-electromechanical systems|Micro-opto-electromechanical systems (MOEMS)]], MEMS including optical elements\n*[[Photoelectrowetting]], MEMS optical actuation using photo-sensitive wetting\n*[[Micropower]], Hydrogen generators, gas turbines, and electrical generators made of etched silicon\n*[[Millipede memory]], a MEMS technology for non-volatile data storage of more than a terabit per square inch\n*[[Nanoelectromechanical systems]] are similar to MEMS but smaller\n*[[Scratch Drive Actuator]], MEMS actuation using repeatedly applied voltage differences\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|MEMS}}\n{{Microtechnology}}\n{{Sensors}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Microelectromechanical Systems}}\n[[Category:Transducers]]\n[[Category:Mechanical engineering]]\n[[Category:Electrical engineering]]\n[[Category:Microtechnology]]\n[[Category:Microelectronic and microelectromechanical systems]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]"}]}}}}
