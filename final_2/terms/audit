It also attempts to ensure that the books of accounts are properly maintained by the concern as required by law. Auditing has become such a ubiquitous phenomenon in the corporate and the public sector that academics started identifying an \"Audit Society\".<ref>Power, Michael. 1999. The Audit Society: Rituals of Verification. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref>  \nThe auditor perceives and recognises the propositions before him/her for examination, obtains evidence, evaluates the same and formulates an opinion on the basis of his judgement which is communicated through his audit report.<ref>{{cite web|title=Audit assurance|url=http://www.icai.org/post.html?post_id=6193}}</ref>\n\nAny subject matter may be audited. Audits provide third party assurance to various [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s that the subject matter is free from [[Materiality (auditing)|material]] misstatement. The term is most frequently applied to audits of the financial information relating to a [[legal person]]. Other areas which are commonly audited include: secretarial & compliance audit, internal  controls, quality management, project management, water management, and energy conservation.\n\nAs a result of an audit, stakeholders may effectively evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and the governance process over the subject matter.\n\nThe word audit is derived from a Latin word \"audire\" which means \"to hear\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Evolution of auditing|url=http://www.davidpublishing.com/Upfile/12/2/2012/2012120283233169.pdf|publisher=David Publishing}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Assurance|first1=Auditing and|publisher=Institute of Chartered Accountants of India|location=Chapter 1, Volume 1|page=1|url=http://www.icai.org/post.html?post_id=6193}}</ref> During the medieval times when manual book-keeping was prevalent, auditors in Britain used to hear the accounts read out for them and checked that the organisation's personnel were not negligent or fraudulent.<ref>{{cite book|first1=History of Auditing|author1=Derek Matthews|title=The changing audit process from the 19th century till date|publisher=Routledge-Taylor & Francis Group|page=6|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ONR8AgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=history+of+auditing&ots=ah8n0IGcZS&sig=fD_9P6fpkh-W8CFn0HOwCjHk4mo#v=onepage&q=medieval&f=false}}</ref>\n\n== Auditing Australia ==\n[[File:Australian National Audit Office Logo.png|thumb|Australian National Audit Office]]\nAudit standards in Australia define 'Audit' as   \n* An official examination and verification of accounts and records, especially of financial accounts, and a report or statement reflecting an audit; a final statement of account.\n* This includes the inspection or examination of a building or other facility to evaluate or improve its appropriateness, safety, efficiency, or example:\n\n* ''An energy audit can suggest ways to reduce home fuel bills.''\n\n==Information technology audit==\n{{Main article|Information technology audit}} {{Main article|Software audit review}}\nAn '''information technology audit''', or '''information systems audit''', is an examination of the management controls within an [[Information technology]] (IT) [[infrastructure]]. The evaluation of obtained evidence determines if the information systems are safeguarding assets, maintaining [[data integrity]], and operating effectively to achieve the organization's goals or objectives. These reviews may be performed in conjunction with a [[Financial audit|financial statement audit]], [[internal audit]], or other form of attestation engagement.\n\n==Accounting==\n{{Main article|Financial audit}}\nDue to strong incentives (including [[taxation]], [[misselling]] and other forms of fraud) to misstate financial information, auditing has become a legal requirement for many entities who have the power to exploit financial information for personal gain. Traditionally, audits were mainly associated with gaining information about financial systems and the financial records of a company or a business.\n\nFinancial audits are performed to ascertain the [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] and [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of information, as well as to provide an [[:wikt:assessment|assessment]] of a system's [[internal control]]. As a result of this, a third party can express an opinion of the person / organisation / system (etc.) in question. The opinion given on financial statements will depends on the [[audit evidence]] obtained.\n\nDue to constraints, an audit seeks to provide only '''reasonable assurance''' that the statements are free from [[Materiality (auditing)|material]] error. Hence, statistical sampling is often adopted in audits. In the case of [[financial audit]]s, a set of [[financial statements]] are said to be true and fair when they are free of material misstatements \u2013 a concept influenced by both [[Numerical data|quantitative]] (numerical) and [[qualitative data|qualitative]] factors. But recently, the argument that auditing should go beyond just true and fair is gaining momentum.<ref>{{cite news|title=Auditors and Audit Reports: Is The Firm's \"John Hancock\" Enough?|url=http://blogs.forbes.com/francinemckenna/2011/07/08/auditors-and-audit-reports-is-the-firms-john-hancock-enough/|accessdate=22 July 2011 | work=Forbes|first=Francine|last=McKenna}}</ref> And the US [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] has come out with a concept release on the same.<ref>{{cite web|title=CONCEPT RELEASE ON POSSIBLE  REVISIONS TO PCAOB STANDARDS RELATED TO REPORTS ON AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS |url=http://pcaobus.org/Rules/Rulemaking/Docket034/Concept_Release.pdf|accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Cost accounting]] is a process for verifying the cost of manufacturing or producing of any article, on the basis of accounts measuring the use of material, labor or other items of cost. In simple words, the term, ''[[Cost auditing|cost audit]]'' means a systematic and accurate verification of the cost accounts and records, and checking for adherence to the cost accounting objectives. According to the Institute of Cost and [[Management Accountant]]s of Pakistan, a [[Cost auditing|cost audit]] is \"an examination of cost accounting records and verification of facts to ascertain that the cost of the product has been arrived at, in accordance with principles of cost accounting.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2012|reason=|cost auditing=}}\n\nIn most nations, an audit must adhere to generally accepted standards established by governing bodies. These standards assure third parties or external users that they can rely upon the auditor's opinion on the fairness of financial statements, or other subjects on which the auditor expresses an opinion.\n\n===Integrated audits===\nIn the US, audits of [[publicly traded]] companies are governed by rules laid down by the [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] (PCAOB), which was established by Section 404 of the [[Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act]] of 2002.  Such an audit is called an integrated audit, where auditors, in addition to an opinion on the financial statements, must also express an opinion on the ''effectiveness'' of a company's ''internal control'' over financial reporting, in accordance with PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pcaobus.org/Standards/Auditing/pages/auditing_standard_5.aspx|title=Auditing Standard No. 5|website=pcaobus.org|access-date=2016-06-28}}</ref>\n\nThere are also new types of integrated auditing becoming available that use unified compliance material (see the unified compliance section in [[Regulatory compliance]]).  Due to the increasing number of regulations and need for operational transparency, organizations are adopting [[risk-based audit]]s that can cover multiple regulations and standards from a single audit event.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  This is a very new but necessary approach in some sectors to ensure that all the necessary [[governance]] requirements can be met without duplicating effort from both audit and audit hosting resources.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n===Assessments===\nThe purpose of an assessment is to measure something or calculate a value for it. Although the process of producing an assessment may involve an audit by an independent professional, its purpose is to provide a measurement rather than to express an opinion about the fairness of statements or quality of performance.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ladda|first1=R.L.|title=Basic Concepts Of Accounting|publisher=Laxmi Book Publication|location=Solapur|isbn=978-1-312-16130-6|page=58}}</ref>\n\n===Auditors===\nAuditors of financial statements & non-financial information (including compliance audit) can be classified into three categories:\n\n*[[External auditor]] / [[Statutory auditor]] is an independent firm engaged by the client subject to the audit, to express an opinion on whether the company's [[financial statements]] are free of material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.  For [[publicly traded companies]], external auditors may also be required to express an opinion over the effectiveness of [[internal controls]] over [[financial reporting]].  External auditors may also be engaged to perform other agreed-upon procedures, related or unrelated to financial statements. Most importantly, external auditors, though engaged and paid by the company being audited, should be regarded as independent {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n*[[Cost auditor]] / Statutory Cost auditor is an independent firm engaged by the client subject to the Cost audit, to express an opinion on whether the company's [[Cost statements and Cost Sheet]] are free of material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error. For [[publicly traded companies]], external auditors may also be required to express an opinion over the effectiveness of [[internal controls]] over Cost reporting. These are Specialised Persons called Cost Accountants in India & CMA globally either Cost & Management Accountants or Certified Management Accountants. {{Further information|Cost auditing}}Government Auditors review the finances and practices of federal agencies. These auditors report their finds to congress, which uses them to create and manage polices and budgets. Government auditors work for the U.S. Government Accountability Office, and most state governments have similar departments to audit state and municipal agencies. ''Further information: [[Internal auditor]]s''\n*[[Secretarial auditor]] / Statutory Secretarial auditor is an independent firm engaged by the client subject to the audit of Secretarial & applicable laws / Compliances of other applicable laws, to express an opinion on whether the company's [[Secretarial records and Compliance of applicable laws]] are free of material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error and inviting heavy fines or penalties. For [[Bigger Public companies]], external Secretarial auditors may also be required to express an opinion over the effectiveness of [[internal controls]] over compliances system management of the Company. These are Specialized Persons called Company Secretaries in India who are the members of Institute of Company Secretaries of India and holding Certificate of Practice. (http://www.icsi.edu/)\n\nThe most commonly used external audit standards are the US [[GAAS]] of the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]]; and the ISA [[International Standards on Auditing]] developed by the [[International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board|International Auditing and Assurance Standard]] \n*[[Internal auditor]]s are employed by the organisations they audit. They work for government agencies (federal, state and local); for publicly traded companies; and for non-profit companies across all industries. The internationally recognised standard setting body for the profession is the Institute of Internal Auditors - IIA (www.theiia.org). The IIA has defined internal auditing as follows: \"Internal auditing is an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organisation's operations. It helps an organisation accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://na.theiia.org/standards-guidance/mandatory-guidance/Pages/Definition-of-Internal-Auditing.aspx |title=Pages - Definition of Internal Auditing |publisher=Na.theiia.org |date=2000-01-01 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref> Thus professional internal auditors provide independent and objective audit and consulting services focused on evaluating whether the board of directors, shareholders, stakeholders, and corporate executives have reasonable assurance that the organization's governance, risk management, and control processes are designed adequately and function effectively. Internal audit professionals (Certified Internal Auditors - CIAs) are governed by the international professional standards and code of conduct of the Institute of Internal Auditors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://na.theiia.org/standards-guidance/Pages/Standards-and-Guidance-IPPF.aspx |title=Pages - International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF) |publisher=Na.theiia.org |date=2000-01-01 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref> While internal auditors are not independent of the companies that employ them, independence and objectivity are a cornerstone of the IIA professional standards; and are discussed at length in the standards and the supporting practice guides and practice advisories. Professional internal auditors are mandated by the IIA standards to be independent of the business activities they audit. This independence and objectivity are achieved through the organizational placement and reporting lines of the internal audit department.  Internal auditors of publicly traded companies in the United States are required to report functionally to the board of directors directly, or a sub-committee of the board of directors (typically the audit committee), and not to management except for administrative purposes. As described often in the professional literature for the practice of internal auditing (such as Internal Auditor, the journal of the IIA) -,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://na.theiia.org/periodicals/Pages/Internal-Auditor-Magazine.aspx |title=Professional internal auditors, in carrying out their responsibilities, apply COSO's Integrated Framework-Internal Control |publisher=Theiia.org}}</ref> or other similar and generally recognized frameworks for management control when evaluating an entity's governance and control practices; and apply COSO's \"Enterprise Risk Management-Integrated Framework\" or other similar and generally recognized frameworks for entity-wide risk management when evaluating an organization's entity-wide risk management practices. Professional internal auditors also use Control Self-Assessment (CSA) as an effective process for performing their work.\n*Consultant auditors are external personnel contracted by the firm to perform an audit following the firm's [[Auditing Standards Board|auditing standards]].  This differs from the [[external auditor]], who follows their own auditing standards.  The level of independence is therefore somewhere between the internal auditor and the external auditor.  The consultant auditor may work independently, or as part of the audit team that includes internal auditors.  Consultant auditors are used when the firm lacks sufficient expertise to audit certain areas, or simply for staff augmentation when staff are not available.\n\n==Performance audits==\nSafety, security, information systems performance, and environmental concerns are increasingly the subject of audits.<ref name=\":0\" /> There are now audit professionals who specialize in [[security audit]]s and [[information systems audit]]s. With nonprofit organisations and [[government agencies]], there has been an increasing need for [[performance audit]]s, examining their success in satisfying mission objectives.\n\n==Quality audits==\n{{Main article|Quality audit}}\n\nQuality audits are performed to verify conformance to standards through review of objective evidence.  A system of quality audits may verify the effectiveness of a quality management system. This is part of certifications such as [[ISO 9001]]. Quality audits are essential to verify the existence of objective evidence showing conformance to required processes, to assess how successfully processes have been implemented, and to judge the effectiveness of achieving any defined target levels. Quality audits are also necessary to provide evidence concerning reduction and elimination of problem areas, and they are a hands-on management tool for achieving continual improvement in an organization.\n\nTo benefit the organisation, quality auditing should not only report non-conformance and corrective actions but also highlight areas of good practice and provide evidence of conformance. In this way, other departments may share information and amend their working practices as a result, also enhancing continual improvement.\n\n==Project management<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdn.projectsmart.co.uk/pdf/undertaking-a-successful-project-audit.pdf|title=UNDERTAKING A SUCCESSFUL PROJECT AUDIT|last=Stanleigh|first=Micheal|date=2009|website=PROJECT SMART|publisher=|access-date=2016}}</ref>==\n\nA project audit provides an opportunity to uncover issues, concerns and challenges encountered during the project lifecycle. Conducted midway through the project, an audit affords the project manager, project sponsor and project team an interim view of what has gone well, as well as what needs to be improved to successfully complete the project. If done at the close of a project, the audit can be used to develop success criteria for future projects by providing a forensic review. This review identifies which elements of the project were successfully managed and which ones presented challenges. As a result, the review will help the organisation identify what it needs to do to avoid repeating the same mistakes on future projects\n\nProjects can undergo 2 types of Project audits:<ref name=\":0\">Different Types of Audits (June 2013) [http://auditronix.com/what-is-audit-types/ Auditronix Guidance Note] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718125350/http://auditronix.com/what-is-audit-types/ |date=July 18, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n* '''Regular Health Check Audits''': The aim of a regular health check audit is to understand the current state of a project in order to increase project success.\n* '''Regulatory Audits''': The aim of a regulatory audit is to verify that a project is compliant with regulations and standards.
