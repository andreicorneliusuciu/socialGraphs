Due to [[negative feedback]], the characteristics  of an op-amp circuit, its gain, input and [[output impedance]], [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] etc. are determined by external components and have little dependence on temperature coefficients or manufacturing variations in the op-amp itself.\n\nOp-amps are among the most widely used electronic devices today, being used in a vast array of consumer, industrial, and scientific devices. Many standard IC op-amps cost only a few cents in moderate production volume; however some integrated or hybrid operational amplifiers with special performance specifications may cost over $100 US in small quantities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Apex OP PA98|url=http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/PA98/598-1337-ND/1761961|accessdate=8 November 2015|quote= APEX PA98 Op Amp Modules, Selling Price: $207.51 }}</ref>  Op-amps may be packaged as components, or used as elements of more complex integrated circuits.\n\nThe op-amp is one type of [[differential amplifier]]. Other types of differential amplifier include the [[fully differential amplifier]] (similar to the op-amp, but with two outputs), the [[instrumentation amplifier]] (usually built from three op-amps), the [[isolation amplifier]] (similar to the instrumentation amplifier, but with tolerance to [[Common-mode signal|common-mode voltages]] that would destroy an ordinary op-amp), and [[negative feedback amplifier]] (usually built from one or more op-amps and a resistive feedback network).\n\n==Operation==\n[[Image:Op-amp open-loop 1.svg|thumb|An op-amp without negative feedback (a comparator)]]\nThe amplifier's differential inputs consist of a non-inverting input (+) with voltage ''V''<sub>+</sub> and an inverting input (\u2013) with voltage ''V''<sub>\u2212</sub>; ideally the op-amp amplifies only the difference in voltage between the two, which is called the ''differential input voltage''. The output voltage of the op-amp ''V''<sub>out</sub> is given by the equation:\n:<math>V_{\\!\\text{out}} = A_\\text{OL} \\, (V_{\\!+} - V_{\\!-})</math>\nwhere ''A''<sub>OL</sub> is the [[Electronic feedback loops|open-loop]] gain of the amplifier (the term \"open-loop\" refers to the absence of a feedback loop from the output to the input).\n\n=== Open loop amplifier  ===\nThe magnitude of ''A''<sub>OL</sub> is typically very large\u2014100,000 or more for integrated circuit op-amps\u2014and therefore even a quite small difference between ''V''<sub>+</sub> and ''V''<sub>\u2212</sub> drives the amplifier output nearly to the supply voltage. Situations in which the output voltage is equal to or greater than the supply voltage are referred to as ''saturation'' of the amplifier.  The magnitude of ''A''<sub>OL</sub> is not well controlled by the manufacturing process, and so it is impractical to use an open loop amplifier as a stand-alone [[differential amplifier]].\n\nWithout [[negative feedback amplifier|negative feedback]], and perhaps with [[positive feedback]] for [[Regenerative circuit|regeneration]], an op-amp acts as a [[comparator]]. If the inverting input is held at ground (0 V) directly or by a resistor R<sub>g</sub>, and the input voltage V<sub>in</sub> applied to the non-inverting input is positive, the output will be maximum positive; if V<sub>in</sub> is negative, the output will be maximum negative. Since there is no feedback from the output to either input, this is an ''[[Electronic feedback loops|open loop]]'' circuit acting as a [[comparator]].\n\n=== Closed loop ===\n[[Image:Operational amplifier noninverting.svg|thumb|An op-amp with negative feedback (a non-inverting amplifier)]]\nIf predictable operation is desired, negative feedback is used, by applying a portion of the output voltage to the inverting input. The ''closed loop'' feedback greatly reduces the gain of the circuit.  When negative feedback is used, the circuit's overall gain and response becomes determined mostly by the feedback network, rather than by the op-amp characteristics. If the feedback network is made of components with values small relative to the op amp's input impedance, the value of the op-amp's open loop response ''A''<sub>OL</sub> does not seriously affect the circuit's performance. The response of the op-amp circuit with its input, output, and feedback circuits to an input is characterized mathematically by a [[transfer function]]; designing an op-amp circuit to have a desired transfer function is in the realm of [[electrical engineering]].  The transfer functions are important in most applications of op-amps, such as in [[analog computers]]. High input [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] at the input terminals and low output impedance at the output terminal(s) are particularly useful features of an op-amp.\n\nIn the non-inverting amplifier on the right, the presence of negative feedback via the [[voltage divider]] ''R''<sub>f</sub>, ''R''<sub>g</sub> determines the ''closed-loop gain'' ''A''<sub>CL</sub> = ''V''<sub>out</sub>&nbsp;/&nbsp;''V''<sub>in</sub>. Equilibrium will be established when ''V''<sub>out</sub> is just sufficient to \"reach around and pull\" the inverting input to the same voltage as ''V''<sub>in</sub>. The voltage gain of the entire circuit is thus 1 + ''R''<sub>f</sub>/''R''<sub>g</sub>. As a simple example, if ''V''<sub>in</sub> = 1&nbsp;V and R<sub>f</sub> = R<sub>g</sub>, V<sub>out</sub> will be 2&nbsp;V, exactly the amount required to keep ''V''<sub>-</sub> at 1&nbsp;V. Because of the feedback provided by the ''R''<sub>f</sub>, ''R''<sub>g</sub> network, this is a ''closed loop'' circuit.\n\nAnother way to analyze this circuit proceeds by making the following (usually valid) assumptions:<ref>Jacob Millman, ''Microelectronics: Digital and Analog Circuits and Systems'', McGraw-Hill, 1979, ISBN 0-07-042327-X, pp. 523-527</ref>\n* When an op-amp operates in linear (i.e., not saturated) mode, the difference in voltage between the non-inverting (+) pin and the inverting (\u2212) pin is negligibly small.\n* The input impedance between (+) and (\u2212) pins is much larger than other resistances in the circuit.\n\nThe input signal ''V''<sub>in</sub> appears at both (+) and (\u2212) pins, resulting in a current ''i'' through ''R''<sub>g</sub> equal to ''V''<sub>in</sub>/''R''<sub>g</sub>. \n: <math>i = \\frac {V_\\text{in}} {R_g}</math>\nSince Kirchhoff's current law states that the same current must leave a node as enter it, and since the impedance into the (\u2212) pin is near infinity, we can assume practically all of the same current ''i'' flows through ''R''<sub>f</sub>, creating an output voltage\n: <math>V_\\text{out} = V_\\text{in} + i \\times R_f = V_\\text{in} + \\left(\\frac {V_\\text{in}} {R_g} \\times R_f\\right) = V_\\text{in} + \\frac{V_\\text{in} \\times R_f} {R_g} = V_\\text{in}  \\left(1 + \\frac{R_f} {R_g}\\right)</math>\nBy combining terms, we determine the closed-loop gain ''A''<sub>CL</sub>:\n: <math>A_\\text{CL} = \\frac{V_\\text{out}} {V_\\text{in}} = 1 + \\frac{R_f} {R_g} </math>\n\n==Op-amp characteristics==\n\n=== Ideal op-amps ===\n[[Image:Op-Amp Internal.svg|thumb|250px|right|An equivalent circuit of an operational amplifier that models some resistive non-ideal parameters.]]\n\nAn ideal op-amp is usually considered to have the following characteristics:\n\n* Infinite [[open-loop gain]] G = ''v''<sub>out</sub> / ''v''<sub>in</sub>\n* Infinite [[input impedance]] R<sub>in</sub>, and so zero input current \n* Zero [[input offset voltage]] \n* Infinite output voltage range\n* Infinite [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] with zero [[phase shift]] and infinite [[slew rate]] \n* Zero [[output impedance]] R<sub>out</sub>\n* Zero [[Electronic noise|noise]]\n* Infinite [[common-mode rejection ratio]] (CMRR)\n* Infinite [[power supply rejection ratio]].\n \nThese ideals can be summarized by the two \"golden rules\":{{ordered list\n| list-style-type=upper-roman\n| '''In a closed loop''' the output attempts to do whatever is necessary to make the voltage difference between the inputs zero.\n| The inputs draw no current.<ref name=AoE>\n {{Cite book\n  | last = Horowitz\n  | first = Paul\n  | authorlink =\n  |last2=Hill |first2=Winfield\n  | title = The Art of Electronics\n  | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n  | year = 1989\n  | location = Cambridge, UK\n  | page =\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bkOMDgwFA28C&pg=PA177&lpg=PA177#v=onepage&q&f=false\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 0-521-37095-7\n }}</ref>{{rp|177}}\n}}\n\nThe first rule only applies in the usual case where the op-amp is used in a closed-loop design (negative feedback, where there is a signal path of some sort feeding back from the output to the inverting input).  These rules are commonly used as a good first approximation for analyzing or designing op-amp circuits.<ref name=\"AoE\"/>{{rp|177}}\n\nNone of these ideals can be perfectly realized. A real op-amp may be modeled with non-infinite or non-zero parameters using equivalent resistors and capacitors in the op-amp model. The designer can then include these effects into the overall performance of the final circuit. Some parameters may turn out to have negligible effect on the final design while others represent actual limitations of the final performance that must be evaluated.\n\n=== Real op-amps ===\nReal op-amps differ from the ideal model in various aspects.\n\n====DC imperfections====\nReal operational amplifiers suffer from several non-ideal effects:\n\n;Finite gain: [[Open-loop gain]] is infinite in the ideal operational amplifier but finite in real operational amplifiers. Typical devices exhibit open-loop DC gain ranging from 100,000 to over 1 million. So long as the [[loop gain]] (i.e., the product of open-loop and feedback gains) is very large, the circuit gain will be determined entirely by the amount of negative feedback (i.e., it will be independent of open-loop gain). In cases where [[closed-loop gain]] must be very high, the feedback gain will be very low, and the low feedback gain causes low loop gain; in these cases, the operational amplifier will cease to behave ideally.\n\n;Finite [[input impedance]]s : The ''differential input impedance'' of the operational amplifier is defined as the impedance ''between'' its two inputs; the ''common-mode input impedance'' is the impedance from each input to ground.  [[MOSFET]]-input operational amplifiers often have protection circuits that effectively short circuit any input differences greater than a small threshold, so the input impedance can appear to be very low in some tests. However, as long as these operational amplifiers are used in a typical high-gain negative feedback application, these protection circuits will be inactive.  The input bias and leakage currents described below are a more important design parameter for typical operational amplifier applications.\n\n;Non-zero [[output impedance]]: Low output impedance is important for low-impedance loads; for these loads, the voltage drop across the output impedance effectively reduces the open loop gain. In configurations with a voltage-sensing negative feedback, the output impedance of the amplifier is effectively lowered; thus, in linear applications, op-amp circuits usually exhibit a very low output impedance indeed.\n:Low-impedance outputs typically require high [[quiescent current|quiescent (i.e., idle) current]] in the output stage and will dissipate more power, so low-power designs may purposely sacrifice low output impedance.\n\n;Input current: Due to [[biasing (electronics)|biasing]] requirements or [[Leakage (semiconductors)|leakage]], a small amount of current (typically ~10 nanoamperes for [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] op-amps, tens of picoamperes (pA) for [[JFET]] input stages, and only a few pA for [[MOSFET]] input stages) flows into the inputs. When large resistors or sources with high output impedances are used in the circuit, these small currents can produce large unmodeled voltage drops. If the input currents are matched, ''and'' the impedance looking ''out'' of ''both'' inputs are matched, then the voltages produced at each input will be equal. Because the operational amplifier operates on the ''difference'' between its inputs, these matched voltages will have no effect.<!-- (unless the operational amplifier has poor [[Common-mode rejection ratio|CMRR]], which is described below). CMRR is usually much better than matching of currents, so not relevant. --> It is more common for the input currents to be slightly mismatched. The difference is called input offset current, and even with matched resistances a small ''offset voltage'' (different from the input offset voltage below) can be produced. This offset voltage can create offsets or drifting in the operational amplifier.\n\n;Input offset [[voltage]]: This voltage, which is what is required across the op-amp's input terminals to drive the output voltage to zero.<ref>D.F. Stout ''Handbook of Operational Amplifier Circuit Design'' (McGraw-Hill, 1976, ISBN 0-07-061797-X ) pp.&nbsp;1&ndash;11.</ref><ref group=\"nb\">This definition hews to the convention of measuring op-amp parameters with respect to the zero voltage point in the circuit, which is usually half the total voltage between the amplifier's positive and negative power rails.</ref> In the perfect amplifier, there would be no input offset voltage. However, it exists in actual op-amps because of imperfections in the differential amplifier that constitutes the input stage of the vast majority of these devices. Input offset voltage creates two problems: First, due to the amplifier's high voltage gain, it virtually assures that the amplifier output will go into saturation if it is operated without negative feedback, even when the input terminals are wired together. Second, in a closed loop, negative feedback configuration, the input offset voltage is amplified along with the signal and this may pose a problem if high precision DC amplification is required or if the input signal is very small.<ref group=\"nb\">Many older designs of operational amplifiers have offset null inputs to allow the offset to be manually adjusted away. Modern precision op-amps can have internal circuits that automatically cancel this offset using [[chopper (electronics)|chopper]]s or other circuits that measure the offset voltage periodically and subtract it from the input voltage.</ref>\n\n;Common-mode gain: A perfect operational amplifier amplifies only the voltage difference between its two inputs, completely rejecting all voltages that are common to both. However, the differential input stage of an operational amplifier is never perfect, leading to the amplification of these common voltages to some degree. The standard measure of this defect is called the [[common-mode rejection ratio]] (denoted CMRR). Minimization of common mode gain is usually important in non-inverting amplifiers (described below) that operate at high amplification.\n\n;Power-supply rejection: The output of a perfect operational amplifier will be completely independent from its power supply. Every real operational amplifier has a finite [[power supply rejection ratio]] (PSRR) that reflects how well the op-amp can reject changes in its supply voltage.\n\n;Temperature effects: All parameters change with temperature. Temperature drift of the input offset voltage is especially important.\n\n;Drift: Real op-amp parameters are subject to slow change over time and with changes in temperature, input conditions, etc.\n\n====AC imperfections====\nThe op-amp gain calculated at DC does not apply at higher frequencies. Thus, for high-speed operation, more sophisticated considerations must be used in an op-amp circuit design.\n\n;Finite [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]: All amplifiers have finite bandwidth. To a first approximation, the op-amp has the frequency response of an [[integrator]] with gain. That is, the gain of a typical op-amp is inversely proportional to frequency and is characterized by its [[gain\u2013bandwidth product]]&nbsp;(GBWP). For example, an op-amp with a GBWP of 1&nbsp;MHz would have a gain of 5 at 200&nbsp;kHz, and a gain of 1 at 1&nbsp;MHz. This dynamic response coupled with the very high DC gain of the op-amp gives it the characteristics of a first-order [[low-pass filter]] with very high DC gain and low cutoff frequency given by the GBWP divided by the DC gain.{{paragraph break}}The finite bandwidth of an op-amp can be the source of several problems, including:{{glossary}}{{term|Stability}}{{defn|Associated with the bandwidth limitation is a phase difference between the input signal and the amplifier output that can lead to [[electronic oscillation|oscillation]] in some feedback circuits. For example, a sinusoidal output signal meant to interfere destructively with an input signal of the same frequency will interfere constructively if delayed by 180 degrees forming [[positive feedback]]. In these cases, the feedback circuit can be [[BIBO stability|stabilized]] by means of [[frequency compensation]], which increases the [[Gain margin|gain or phase margin]] of the open-loop circuit. The circuit designer can implement this compensation externally with a separate circuit component. Alternatively, the compensation can be implemented within the operational amplifier with the addition of a [[Frequency compensation#Dominant-pole compensation|dominant pole]] that sufficiently attenuates the high-frequency gain of the operational amplifier. The location of this pole may be fixed internally by the manufacturer or configured by the circuit designer using methods specific to the op-amp. In general, dominant-pole frequency compensation reduces the bandwidth of the op-amp even further. When the desired closed-loop gain is high, op-amp frequency compensation is often not needed because the requisite open-loop gain is sufficiently low; consequently, applications with high closed-loop gain can make use of op-amps with higher bandwidths.}}{{term|Distortion, and Other Effects}}{{defn|Limited bandwidth also results in lower amounts of feedback at higher frequencies, producing higher distortion, and output impedance as the frequency increases.}}{{glossary end}}{{paragraph break}}Typical low-cost, general-purpose op-amps exhibit a GBWP of a few megahertz. Specialty and high-speed op-amps exist that can achieve a GBWP of hundreds of megahertz. For very high-frequency circuits, a [[current-feedback operational amplifier]] is often used.\n\n;Noise: Amplifiers generate random voltage at the output even when there is no signal applied. This can be due to thermal noise and flicker noise of the devices. For applications with high gain or high bandwidth, noise becomes a very important consideration.\n\n;Input [[capacitance]]: Most important for high frequency operation because it reduces input impedance and may cause phase shifts.\n\n;Common-mode gain: See DC imperfections, above.\n\n;Power-supply rejection: With increasing frequency the power-supply rejection usually gets worse. So it can be important to keep the supply clean of higher frequency ripples and signals, e.g. by the use of [[bypass capacitor]]s.\n\n====Non-linear imperfections====\n[[File:Inverting Amplifier Signal Clipping.png|thumb|The input (yellow) and output (green) of a saturated op amp in an inverting amplifier]]\n;[[Clipping (signal processing)|Saturation]]:Output voltage is limited to a minimum and maximum value close to the [[power supply]] voltages.<ref group=\"nb\">That the output cannot reach the power supply voltages is usually the result of limitations of the amplifier's output stage transistors. See [[#Output stage|Output stage]].</ref> The output of older op-amps can reach to within one or two volts of the supply rails. The output of newer so-called \"rail to rail\" op-amps can reach to within millivolts of the supply rails when providing low output currents.\n\n;Slewing: The amplifier's output voltage reaches its maximum rate of change, the [[slew rate]], usually specified in volts per microsecond. When slewing occurs, further increases in the input signal have no effect on the rate of change of the output. Slewing is usually caused by the input stage saturating; the result is a constant current {{mvar|i}} driving a capacitance {{mvar|C}} in the amplifier (especially those capacitances used to implement its [[frequency compensation]]); the slew rate is limited by {{math|''dv''/''dt''{{=}}''i''/''C''}}.{{paragraph break}}Slewing is associated with the ''large-signal'' performance of an op-amp.  Consider, for example, an op-amp configured for a gain of 10.  Let the input be a 1 V, 100&nbsp;kHz sawtooth wave. That is, the amplitude is 1 V and the period is 10 microseconds. Accordingly, the rate of change (i.e., the slope) of the input is 0.1 V per microsecond.  After 10x amplification, the output should be a 10 V,  100&nbsp;kHz sawtooth, with a corresponding slew rate of 1 V per microsecond.  However, the classic 741 op-amp has a 0.5 V per microsecond slew rate specification, so that its output can rise to no more than 5 V in the sawtooth's 10 microsecond period. Thus, if one were to measure the output, it would be a 5 V, 100&nbsp;kHz sawtooth, rather than a 10 V, 100&nbsp;kHz sawtooth.{{paragraph break}}Next consider the same amplifier and 100&nbsp;kHz sawtooth, but now the input amplitude is 100 mV rather than 1 V.  After 10x amplification the output is a 1 V, 100&nbsp;kHz sawtooth with a corresponding slew rate of 0.1 V per microsecond.  In this instance the 741 with its 0.5 V per microsecond slew rate will amplify the input properly.{{paragraph break}}Modern high speed op-amps can have slew rates in excess of 5,000 V per microsecond. However, it is more common for op-amps to have slew rates in the range 5-100 V per microsecond.  For example, the general purpose TL081 op-amp has a slew rate of 13 V per microsecond.  As a general rule, low power and small bandwidth op-amps have low slew rates.  As an example, the LT1494 micropower op-amp consumes 1.5 microamp but has a 2.7&nbsp;kHz gain-bandwidth product and a 0.001 V per microsecond slew rate.\n\n;Non-[[linear]] input-output relationship: The output voltage may not be accurately proportional to the difference between the input voltages. It is commonly called distortion when the input signal is a waveform. This effect will be very small in a practical circuit where substantial negative feedback is used.\n\n;Phase reversal: In some integrated op-amps, when the published common mode voltage is violated (e.g., by one of the inputs being driven to one of the supply voltages), the output may slew to the opposite polarity from what is expected in normal operation.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/tutorials/MT-036.pdf\n |title=Op Amp Output Phase-Reversal and Input Over-Voltage Protection\n |year=2009\n |publisher=Analog Devices\n |accessdate=2012-12-27\n}}</ref><ref>\n {{cite web\n |url=http://www.edn.com/contents/images/45890.pdf\n |title=Bootstrapping your op amp yields wide voltage swings\n |last1=King\n |first1=Grayson\n |last2=Watkins\n |first2=Tim\n |date=13 May 1999\n |publisher=Electronic Design News\n |accessdate=2012-12-27\n |deadurl=yes\n |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6E5LQMfRT |archivedate= January 31, 2013 }}</ref>  Under such conditions, negative feedback becomes positive, likely causing the circuit to \"lock up\" in that state.\n\n====Power considerations====\n;Limited [[current limiting|output current]]: The output current must be finite. In practice, most op-amps are designed to limit the output current so as not to exceed a specified level \u2013 around 25&thinsp;mA for a type 741 IC op-amp \u2013 thus protecting the op-amp and associated circuitry from damage. Modern designs are electronically more rugged than earlier implementations and some can sustain direct [[short circuit]]s on their outputs without damage.\n\n;Output sink current: The output sink current is the maximum current allowed to sink into the output stage. Some manufacturers show the output voltage vs. the output sink current plot, which gives an idea of the output voltage when it is sinking current from another source into the output pin.\n;Limited dissipated [[electric power|power]]: The output current flows through the op-amp's internal output impedance, dissipating heat.  If the op-amp dissipates too much power, then its temperature will increase above some safe limit. The op-amp may enter thermal shutdown, or it may be destroyed.\n\nModern integrated [[Field effect transistor|FET]] or [[MOSFET]] op-amps approximate more closely the ideal op-amp than bipolar ICs when it comes to input impedance and input bias currents. Bipolars are generally better when it comes to input ''voltage'' offset, and often have lower noise. Generally, at room temperature, with a fairly large signal, and limited bandwidth, FET and MOSFET op-amps now offer better performance.\n\n== Internal circuitry of 741-type op-amp ==\n{{split section|MA741|Talk:Operational amplifier#Seperate page for the \u03bcA741?|date=July 2015}}\n[[Image:OpAmpTransistorLevel Colored Labeled.svg|thumb|right|500px|A component-level diagram of the common 741 op-amp.

For the typical ''V''<sub>''S''</sub> = \u00b120&nbsp;V, the standing current in Q11/Q12 (as well as in Q13) would be \u22481&nbsp;mA. \nA supply current for a typical 741 of about 2&nbsp;mA agrees with the notion that these two bias currents dominate the quiescent supply current.<!-- per NS LM714 data sheet -->\n\nTransistors Q11 and Q10 form a [[Widlar current mirror]], with quiescent current in Q10 ''i''<sub>10</sub> such that ln( ''i''<sub>11</sub> / ''i''<sub>10</sub> ) = ''i''<sub>10</sub> * 5&nbsp;k&Omega; / 28&nbsp;mV, where 5&nbsp;k&Omega; represents the emitter resistor of Q10, and 28&nbsp;mV is V<sub>T</sub>, the [[thermal voltage]] at room temperature. In this case ''i''<sub>10</sub> \u2248 20&nbsp;\u03bcA.\n\n==== Differential amplifier ====\nThe biasing circuit of this stage is set by a feedback loop that forces the collector currents of Q10 and Q9 to (nearly) match. The small difference in these currents provides the drive for the common base of Q3/Q4 (note that the base drive for input transistors Q1/Q2 is the input bias current and must be sourced externally).\nThe summed quiescent currents of Q1/Q3 plus Q2/Q4 is mirrored from Q8 into Q9, where it is summed with the collector current in Q10, the result being applied to the bases of Q3/Q4.\n\nThe quiescent currents of  Q1/Q3 (resp., Q2/Q4) ''i''<sub>1</sub> will thus be half of ''i''<sub>10</sub>, of order \u2248  10&nbsp;\u03bcA. \nInput bias current for the base of Q1 (resp. Q2) will amount to ''i''<sub>1</sub> / \u03b2; typically \u224850&nbsp;nA,<!-- per National Semiconductor specification for the LM741--> implying a current gain ''h''<sub>fe</sub> \u2248 200 for Q1(Q2).\n\nThis feedback circuit tends to draw the common base node of Q3/Q4 to a voltage ''V''<sub>com</sub> \u2212 2 * ''V''<sub>BE</sub>, where ''V''<sub>com</sub> is the input common-mode voltage. At the same time, the magnitude of the quiescent current is relatively insensitive to the characteristics of the components Q1\u2013Q4, such as ''h''<sub>fe</sub>, that would otherwise cause temperature dependence or part-to-part variations.\n\nTransistor Q7 drives Q5 and Q6 into conduction until their (equal) collector currents match that of Q1/Q3 and Q2/Q4. The quiescent current in Q7 is ''V''<sub>BE</sub> / 50&nbsp;k&Omega;, about 35\u03bcA, as is the quiescent current in Q15, with its matching operating point.\nThus, the quiescent currents are pairwise matched in Q1/Q2, Q3/Q4, Q5/Q6, and Q7/Q15. \n<!--The classical [[Differential amplifier#Long-tailed pair|emitter-coupled differential stage]] is biased from the side of the emitters by connecting a constant current source to them. The series negative feedback (the emitter degeneration) makes the transistors act as voltage stabilizers; it forces them to adjust their ''V''<sub>BE</sub> voltages so that to pass the current through their collector-emitter junctions. As a result, ''the quiescent current is \u03b2-independent''.-->\n <!--Here, the Q3/Q4 emitters are already used as inputs. Their collectors are separated and cannot be used as inputs for the quiescent current source since they behave as current sources. So, the quiescent current can be set only from the side of the bases by connecting a constant current source to them. To make it not depend on \u03b2 as above, a negative but parallel feedback is used. For this purpose, the total quiescent current is mirrored by Q8-Q9 current mirror and the negative feedback is taken from the Q9 collector. Now it makes the transistors Q1-Q4 adjust their ''V''<sub>BE</sub> voltages so that to pass the desired quiescent current. The effect is the same as at the classical emitter-coupled pair \u2014 ''the quiescent current is \u03b2-independent''. It is interesting fact that \"to the extent that all PNP \u03b2s match, this clever circuit generates just the right \u03b2-dependent base current to produce a \u03b2-independent collector current\".<ref name = \"Lee\" /> The biasing base currents are usually provided only by the negative power supply; they should come from the ground and enter the bases. But to ensure maximum high input impedances, the biasing loops are not internally closed between the base and ground; it is expected they will be closed externally by the input sources. So, the sources have to be galvanic (DC) to ensure paths for the biasing currents and low resistive enough (tens or hundreds kilohms) to not create significant voltage drops across them. Otherwise, additional DC elements should be connected between the bases and the ground (or the positive power supply).-->\n<!--The quiescent current is set by the 39 k\u03a9 resistor that is common for the two current mirrors Q12-Q13 and Q10-Q11. The current determined by this resistor acts also as a reference for the other bias currents used in the chip. The [[Widlar current mirror]] built by Q10, Q11, and the 5 k\u03a9 resistor produces a very small fraction of ''I''<sub>ref</sub> at the Q10 collector. This small constant current through Q10's collector supplies the base currents for Q3 and Q4 as well as the Q9 collector current. The Q8/Q9 current mirror tries to make Q9 collector current the same as the Q3 and Q4 collector currents and succeeds with the help of the negative feedback. The Q9 collector voltage changes until the ratio between the Q3/Q4 base and collector currents becomes equal to \u03b2. Thus Q3 and Q4's combined base currents (which are of the same order as the overall chip's input currents) are a small fraction of the already small Q10 current.-->\n<!-- Thus the quiescent current is set by Q10-Q11 current mirror without using a current-sensing negative feedback. The voltage-sensing negative feedback only helps this process by stabilizing Q9 collector (Q3/Q4 base) voltage.<ref group=\"nb\">This arrangement can be generalized by an equivalent circuit consisting of a constant current source loaded by a voltage source; the voltage source fixes the voltage across the current source while the current source sets the current through the voltage source. As the two heterogeneous sources provide ideal load conditions for each other, this circuit solution is widely used in [[cascode|cascode circuits]], [[Wilson current mirror]], the input part of the simple [[current mirror]], emitter-coupled and other exotic circuits.</ref> The feedback loop also isolates the rest of the circuit from [[common-mode signal]]s by making the base voltage of Q3/Q4 follow tightly 2''V''<sub>BE</sub> below the higher of the two input voltages.-->\n\n==== Voltage amplifier ====\n\nQuiescent currents in Q16 and Q19 are set by the current mirror Q12/Q13, which is running at \u2248 1&nbsp;mA. Through some{{vague|date=January 2016}} mechanism, the collector current in Q19 tracks that standing current.\n\n==== Output amplifier ====\n\nIn the circuit involving Q16 (variously named [[rubber diode]] or ''V''<sub>BE</sub> multiplier), the 4.5&nbsp;k&Omega; resistor must be conducting about 100&nbsp;\u03bcA, with the Q16 ''V''<sub>BE</sub> roughly 700&nbsp;mV. Then the ''V''<sub>CB</sub> must be about 0.45&nbsp;V and ''V''<sub>CE</sub> at about 1.0&nbsp;V. Because the Q16 collector is driven by a current source and the Q16 emitter drives into the Q19 collector current sink, the Q16 transistor establishes a voltage difference between Q14 base and Q20 base of \u2248 1&nbsp;V, regardless of the common-mode voltage of Q14/Q20 base. The standing current in Q14/Q20 will be a factor [[Diode modelling|exp(100&nbsp;mV / V<sub>T</sub> ) \u2248 36]] smaller than the 1&nbsp;mA quiescent current in the class A portion of the op amp. This (small) standing current in the output transistors establishes the output stage in class AB operation and reduces the [[crossover distortion]] of this stage. \n<!-- [[Image:Block Diagram for Feedback.svg|thumb|right|The circuit presented as a negative feedback amplifier with constant input voltage|250px|right]]\nThe green outlined section (based on Q16) is a voltage level shifter named ''rubber diode'', ''transistor Zener'' or ''V<sub>BE</sub> multiplier''. In the circuit as shown, Q16 provides a constant voltage drop across its collector-emitter junction regardless of the current through it (it acts as a voltage stabilizer). This is achieved by introducing a negative feedback between Q16 collector and its base, i.e. by connecting a voltage divider with ratio \u03b2 = 7.5 k\u03a9 / (4.5 k\u03a9 + 7.5 k\u03a9) = 0.625 composed by the two resistors. If the base current to the transistor is assumed to be zero, the negative feedback forces the transistor to increase its collector-emitter voltage up to 1 V until its base-emitter voltage reaches 0.625 V (a typical value for a BJT in the active region). This serves to bias the two output transistors slightly into conduction reducing [[crossover distortion]] (in some discrete component amplifiers, this function is usually achieved with a string of two silicon diodes).\n<p>\nThe circuit can be presented as a negative feedback voltage amplifier with constant input voltage of 0.625 V and a feedback ratio of \u03b2 = 0.625 (a gain of 1/\u03b2 = 1.6). The same circuit but with \u03b2 = 1 is used in the input current-setting part of the classical [[Current mirror#Basic bipolar transistor mirror|BJT current mirror]].-->\n\n=== Small-signal differential mode ===\nA small differential input voltage signal gives rise, through multiple stages of current amplification, to a much larger voltage signal on output.\n\n==== Input impedance ====\nThe input stage with Q1 and Q3 is similar to an emitter-coupled pair (long-tailed pair), with Q2 and Q4 adding some degenerating impedance. The input impedance is relatively high because of the small current through Q1-Q4.\nA typical 741 op amp has an differential input impedance of about 2 M&Omega;.<!-- per NS LM741 data sheet --> \nThe common mode input impedance is even higher, as the input stage works at an essentially constant current.\n\n==== Differential amplifier ====\nA differential voltage ''V''<sub>In</sub> at the op-amp inputs (pins 3 and 2, respectively) gives rise to a small differential current in the bases of Q1 and Q2 ''i''<sub>In</sub> \u2248 ''V''<sub>In</sub> / ( 2 ''h''<sub>ie</sub> * ''h''<sub>fe</sub>). \nThis differential base current causes a change in the differential collector current in each leg by ''i''<sub>In</sub> * ''h''<sub>fe</sub>. Introducing the transconductance of Q1, ''g''<sub>''m''</sub> = ''h''<sub>fe</sub> / ''h''<sub>ie</sub>, the (small-signal) current at the base of Q15 (the input of the voltage gain stage) is ''V''<sub>In</sub> * ''g''<sub>''m''</sub> / 2.\n\nThis portion of the op amp cleverly changes a differential signal at the op amp inputs to a single-ended signal at the base of Q15, and in a way that avoids wastefully discarding the signal in either leg. To see how, notice that a small negative change in voltage at the inverting input (Q2 base) drives it out of conduction, and this incremental decrease in current passes directly from Q4 collector to its emitter, resulting in an decrease in base drive for Q15. On the other hand, a small positive change in voltage at the non-inverting input (Q1 base) drives this transistor into conduction, reflected in an increase in current at the collector of Q3. This current drives Q7 further into conduction, which turns on current mirror Q5/Q6. Thus, the increase in Q3 emitter current is mirrored in an increase in Q6 collector current; the increased collector currents shunts more from the collector node and results in a decrease in base drive current for Q15. Besides avoiding wasting 3&nbsp;dB of gain here, this technique decreases common-mode gain and feedthrough of power supply noise. \n<!-- The input voltage sources are connected through two \"diode\" strings, each of them consisting of two connected in series base-emitter junctions (Q1-Q3 and Q2-Q4), to the common point of Q3/Q4 bases. So, if the input voltages change slightly in opposite directions, Q3/Q4 bases stay at relatively constant voltage and the common base current does not change as well; it only vigorously steers between Q3/Q4 bases and makes the common quiescent current distribute between Q3/Q4 collectors in the same proportion.<ref group=\"nb\">If the input differential voltage changes significantly (with more than about a hundred millivolts), the base-emitter junctions of the transistors driven by the lower input voltage (e.g., Q1 and Q3) become backward biased and the total common base current flows through the other (Q2 and Q4) base-emitter junctions. However, the high breakdown voltage of the PNP transistors Q3/Q4 prevents Q1/Q2 base-emitter junctions from damaging when the input difference voltage increases up to 50 V because of the unlimited current that may flow directly through the \"diode bridge\" between the two input sources.</ref> The current mirror inverts Q3 collector current and tries to pass it through Q4. In the middle point between Q4 and Q6, the signal currents (current changes) of Q3 and Q4 are subtracted. In this case (differential input signal), they are equal and opposite. Thus, the difference is twice the individual signal currents (\u0394''I'' \u2212 (\u2212\u0394''I'') = 2\u0394''I'')<! --{{Dubious|date=June 2011}} if signals equal and opposite, their sum would be zero. Must explain the mirror's gain. -- > and the differential to single ended conversion is completed without gain losses. The open circuit signal voltage appearing at this point is given by the product of the subtracted signal currents and the total circuit impedance (the paralleled collector resistances of Q4 and Q6). Since the collectors of Q4 and Q6 appear as high differential resistances to the signal current (Q4 and Q6 behave as current sources), the open circuit voltage gain of this stage is very high.<ref group=\"nb\">This circuit (and geometrical) phenomenon can be illustrated graphically by superimposing the Q4 and Q6 output characteristics (almost parallel horizontal lines) on the same coordinate system. When the input voltages vary slightly in opposite directions, the two curves move slightly toward each other in the vertical direction but the operating (cross) point moves vigorously in the horizontal direction. The ratio between the two movements represents the high amplification.</ref>\n<p>\nMore intuitively, the transistor Q6 can be considered as a duplicate of Q3 and the combination of Q4 and Q6 can be thought as of a varying voltage divider composed of two voltage-controlled resistors. For differential input signals, they vigorously change their instant resistances in opposite directions but the total resistance stays constant (like a potentiometer with quickly moving slider). As a result, the current stays constant as well but the voltage at the middle point changes vigorously. As the two resistance changes are equal and opposite, the effective voltage change is twice the individual change. -->\n\n==== Voltage amplifier ====\nA current signal ''i'' at Q15's base gives rise to a current in Q19 of order ''i'' * \u03b2<sup>2</sup> (the product of the ''h''<sub>fe</sub> of each of Q15 and Q19, which are connected in a [[Darlington pair]]). This current signal develops a voltage at the bases of output transistors Q14/Q20 proportional to the ''h''<sub>ie</sub> of the respective transistor.\n\n==== Output amplifier ====\nOutput transistors Q14 and Q20 are each configured as an emitter follower, so no voltage gain occurs there; instead, this stage provides current gain, equal to the ''h''<sub>fe</sub> of Q14 (resp. Q20).\n\nThe output impedance is not zero, as it would be in an ideal op-amp, but with negative feedback it approaches zero at low frequencies.\n\n==== Overall open-loop voltage gain ====\nThe net open-loop small-signal voltage gain of the op amp involves the product of the current gain ''h''<sub>fe</sub> of some 4 transistors. \nIn practice, the voltage gain for a typical 741-style op amp is of order 200,000,<!-- per NS LM741 data sheet --> and the current gain, the ratio of input impedance (\u22482\u22126 M&Omega;) to output impedance (\u224850&Omega;) provides yet more (power) gain.\n\n=== Other linear characteristics ===\n\n==== Small-signal common mode gain ====\nThe ideal op amp has infinite [[common-mode rejection ratio]], or zero common-mode gain.\n\nIn the present circuit, if the input voltages change in the same direction, the negative feedback makes Q3/Q4 base voltage follow (with 2''V''<sub>BE</sub> below) the input voltage variations. Now the output part (Q10) of Q10-Q11 current mirror keeps up the common current through Q9/Q8 constant in spite of varying voltage. Q3/Q4 collector currents, and accordingly the output current at the base of Q15, remain unchanged.\n\nIn the typical 741 op amp, the common-mode rejection ratio is 90&nbsp;dB,<!-- per NS LM741 data sheet --> implying an open-loop common-mode voltage gain of about 6.<!-- 200,000 / 10^^(4.5) -->\n\n==== Frequency compensation ====\nThe innovation of the Fairchild \u03bcA741 was the introduction of [[frequency compensation]] via an on-chip (monolithic) capacitor, simplifying application of the op amp by eliminating the need for external components for this function. \nThe 30 pF capacitor stabilizes the amplifier via [[Miller effect|Miller compensation]] and functions in a manner similar to an op-amp [[integrator]] circuit. Also known as 'dominant [[Pole (complex analysis)|pole]] compensation' because it introduces a pole that masks (dominates) the effects of other poles into the [[open loop]] frequency response; in a 741 op amp this pole can be as low as 10&nbsp;Hz (where it causes a \u22123&nbsp;dB loss of open loop voltage gain).\n\nThis internal compensation is provided to achieve unconditional [[BIBO stability|stability]] of the amplifier in negative feedback configurations where the feedback network is non-reactive and the [[Electronic feedback loops|closed loop]] gain is [[unity (mathematics)|unity]] or higher. \nBy contrast, amplifiers requiring external compensation, such as the \u03bcA748, may require external compensation or closed-loop gains significantly higher than unity.\n\n==== Input offset voltage ====\nThe \"offset null\" pins may be used to place external resistors (typically in the form of the two ends of a potentiometer, with the slider connected to ''V''<sub>''S''\u2013</sub>) in parallel with the emitter resistors of Q5 and Q6, to adjust the balance of the Q5/Q6 current mirror. The potentiometer is adjusted such that the output is null (midrange) when the inputs are shorted together.\n\n=== Non-linear characteristics ===\n\n==== Input breakdown voltage ====\nThe transistors Q3, Q4 help to increase the reverse ''V''<sub>BE</sub> rating: the base-emitter junctions of the NPN transistors Q1 and Q2 break down at around 7V, but the PNP transistors Q3 and Q4 have ''V''<sub>BE</sub> breakdown voltages around 50 V.<ref>[http://ecow.engr.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/get/ece/342/schowalter/notes/chapter10/theua741operationalamplifier.ppt The \u03bcA741 Operational Amplifier] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n==== Output-stage voltage swing and current limiting ====\nVariations in the quiescent current with temperature, or between parts with the same type number, are common, so [[crossover distortion]] and [[quiescent current]] may be subject to significant variation.\n\nThe output range of the amplifier is about one volt less than the supply voltage, owing in part to ''V''<sub>BE</sub> of the output transistors Q14 and Q20.\n\nThe 25 \u03a9 resistor at the Q14 emitter, along with Q17, acts to limit Q14 current to about 25 mA; otherwise, Q17 conducts no current.\n\nCurrent limiting for Q20 is performed in the voltage gain stage: Q22 senses the voltage across Q19's emitter resistor (50&Omega;); as it turns on, it diminishes the drive current to Q15 base.\n\nLater versions of this amplifier schematic may show a somewhat different method of output current limiting.\n\n===Applicability considerations===\n''Note: while the 741 was historically used in audio and other sensitive equipment, such use is now rare because of the improved [[Colors of noise|noise]] performance of more modern op-amps. Apart from generating noticeable hiss, 741s and other older op-amps may have poor [[common-mode rejection ratio]]s and so will often introduce cable-borne mains hum and other common-mode interference, such as switch 'clicks', into sensitive equipment.\n\nThe \"741\" has come to often mean a generic op-amp IC (such as \u03bcA741, LM301, 558, LM324, TBA221 \u2014 or a more modern replacement such as the TL071).  The description of the 741 output stage is qualitatively similar for many other designs (that may have quite different input stages), except:\n* Some devices (\u03bcA748, LM301, LM308) are not internally compensated (require an external capacitor from output to some point within the operational amplifier, if used in low closed-loop gain applications).\n* Some modern devices have \"rail-to-rail output\" capability, meaning that the output can range from within a few millivolts of the positive supply voltage to within a few millivolts of the negative supply voltage.\n\n== Classification ==\nOp-amps may be classified by their construction:\n* discrete (built from individual [[transistor]]s or [[vacuum tube|tubes/valves]])\n* IC (fabricated in an [[Integrated circuit]]) \u2014 most common\n* hybrid\nIC op-amps may be classified in many ways, including:\n* Military, Industrial, or Commercial grade (for example: the LM301 is the commercial grade version of the LM101, the LM201 is the industrial version). This may define [[operating temperature]] ranges and other environmental or quality factors.\n* Classification by package type may also affect environmental hardiness, as well as manufacturing options; [[Dual in-line package|DIP]], and other through-hole packages are tending to be replaced by [[Surface-mount technology|surface-mount devices]].\n* Classification by internal compensation: op-amps may suffer from high frequency [[Nyquist stability criterion|instability]] in some [[negative feedback]] circuits unless a small compensation capacitor modifies the phase and frequency responses. Op-amps with a built-in capacitor are termed \"''compensated''\", or perhaps compensated for [[Electronic feedback loops|closed-loop]] gains down to (say) 5. All others are considered uncompensated.\n* Single, dual and quad versions of many commercial op-amp IC are available, meaning 1, 2 or 4 operational amplifiers are included in the same package.\n* Rail-to-rail input (and/or output) op-amps can work with input (and/or output) signals very close to the power supply rails.\n* [[CMOS]] op-amps (such as the CA3140E) provide extremely high input resistances, higher than [[JFET]]-input op-amps, which are normally higher than [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]]-input op-amps.\n* other varieties of op-amp include programmable op-amps (simply meaning the quiescent current, bandwidth and so on can be adjusted by an external resistor).\n* manufacturers often tabulate their op-amps according to purpose, such as low-noise pre-amplifiers, wide bandwidth amplifiers, and so on.\n\n== Applications ==\n[[Image:Generic 741 pinout top.png|thumb|[[Dual in-line package|DIP]] [[pinout]] for 741-type operational amplifier]]\n\n{{Main|Operational amplifier applications}}\n\n=== Use in electronics system design ===\nThe use of op-amps as circuit blocks is much easier and clearer than specifying all their individual circuit elements (transistors, resistors, etc.), whether the amplifiers used are integrated or discrete circuits. In the first approximation op-amps can be used as if they were ideal differential gain blocks; at a later stage limits can be placed on the acceptable range of parameters for each op-amp.\n\nCircuit design follows the same lines for all electronic circuits. A specification is drawn up governing what the circuit is required to do, with allowable limits. For example, the gain may be required to be 100 times, with a tolerance of 5% but drift of less than 1% in a specified temperature range; the input impedance not less than one megohm; etc.\n\nA basic [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] is designed, often with the help of circuit modeling (on a computer). Specific commercially available op-amps and other components are then chosen that meet the design criteria within the specified tolerances at acceptable cost. If not all criteria can be met, the specification may need to be modified.\n\nA prototype is then built and tested; changes to meet or improve the specification, alter functionality, or reduce the cost, may be made.\n\n=== Applications without using any feedback ===\nThat is, the op-amp is being used as a [[voltage comparator]]. Note that a device designed primarily as a comparator may be better if, for instance, speed is important or a wide range of input voltages may be found, since such devices can quickly recover from full on or full off (\"saturated\") states.\n\nA ''voltage level detector'' can be obtained if a reference voltage ''V''<sub>ref</sub> is applied to one of the op-amp's inputs. This means that the op-amp is set up as a comparator to detect a positive voltage. If the voltage to be sensed, ''E''<sub>i</sub>, is applied to op amp's (+) input, the result is a noninverting positive-level detector: when ''E''<sub>i</sub> is above ''V''<sub>ref</sub>, ''V''<sub>O</sub> equals +''V''<sub>sat</sub>; when ''E''<sub>i</sub> is below ''V''<sub>ref</sub>, ''V''<sub>O</sub> equals \u2212''V''<sub>sat</sub>. If ''E''<sub>i</sub> is applied to the inverting input, the circuit is an inverting positive-level detector: When ''E''<sub>i</sub> is above ''V''<sub>ref</sub>, ''V''<sub>O</sub> equals \u2212''V''<sub>sat</sub>.\n\nA ''zero voltage level detector'' (''E''<sub>i</sub> = 0) can convert, for example, the output of a sine-wave from a function generator into a variable-frequency square wave. If ''E''<sub>i</sub> is a sine wave, triangular wave, or wave of any other shape that is symmetrical around zero, the zero-crossing detector's output will be square.  Zero-crossing detection may also be useful in triggering [[TRIAC]]s at the best time to reduce mains interference and current spikes.\n\n===Positive feedback applications===\nAnother typical configuration of op-amps is with positive feedback, which takes a fraction of the output signal back to the non-inverting input. An important application of it is the comparator with hysteresis, the [[Schmitt trigger]].  Some circuits may use ''Positive'' feedback and ''Negative'' feedback around the same amplifier, for example [[Triangle wave]] [[oscillators]] and [[active filters]].\n\nBecause of the wide slew-range and lack of positive feedback, the response of all the open-loop level detectors described [[#Applications without using any feedback|above]] will be relatively slow. External overall positive feedback may be applied but (unlike internal positive feedback that may be applied within the latter stages of a purpose-designed comparator) this markedly affects the accuracy of the zero-crossing detection point. Using a general-purpose op-amp, for example, the frequency of ''E''<sub>i</sub> for the sine to square wave converter should probably be below 100&nbsp;Hz.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n===Negative feedback applications===\n\n==== Non-inverting amplifier ====\n[[Image:Op-Amp Non-Inverting Amplifier.svg|frame|An op-amp connected in the non-inverting amplifier configuration]]\n\n''In a non-inverting amplifier, the output voltage changes in the same direction as the input voltage.''\n\nThe gain equation for the op-amp is:\n\n:<math>V_{\\text{out}} = A_{OL} \\, (V_{\\!+} - V_{\\!-})</math>\n\nHowever, in this circuit ''V''<sub>\u2212</sub> is a function of ''V''<sub>out</sub> because of the negative feedback through the ''R''<sub>1</sub> ''R''<sub>2</sub> network.  ''R''<sub>1</sub> and ''R''<sub>2</sub> form a [[voltage divider]], and as ''V''<sub>\u2212</sub> is a high-impedance input, it does not load it appreciably.  Consequently:\n\n:<math>V_{\\!-} \\,\\, = \\beta \\cdot V_{\\text{out}}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\beta = \\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2}</math>\n\nSubstituting this into the gain equation, we obtain:\n\n:<math>V_{\\text{out}} = A_{OL} (V_{\\text{in}} - \\beta \\cdot V_{\\text{out}})</math>\n\nSolving for <math>V_{\\text{out}}</math>:\n\n:<math>V_{\\text{out}} = V_{\\text{in}} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\beta + 1/A_{OL}} \\right)</math>\n\nIf <math>A_{OL}</math> is very large, this simplifies to\n\n:<math>\nV_{\\text{out}}\n\\approx \\frac{V_{\\text{in}}}{\\beta}\n= \\frac{V_{\\text{in}}}{\\frac{R_{\\text{1}}}{R_{\\text{1}}+R_{\\text{2}}}}\n= V_{\\text{in}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{R_2}{R_1} \\right)\n</math>.\n\nThe non-inverting input of the operational amplifier needs a path for DC to ground; if the signal source does not supply a DC path, or if that source requires a given load impedance, then the circuit will require another resistor from the non-inverting input to ground. When the operational amplifier's input bias currents are significant, then the DC source resistances driving the inputs should be balanced.<ref>An input bias current of 1&nbsp;&micro;A through a DC source resistance of 10&nbsp;k&Omega; produces a 10&nbsp;mV offset voltage. If the other input bias current is the same and sees the same source resistance, then the two input offset voltages will cancel out.  Balancing the DC source resistances may not be necessary if the input bias current and source resistance product is small.</ref>  The ideal value for the feedback resistors (to give minimum offset voltage) will be such that the two resistances in parallel roughly equal the resistance to ground at the non-inverting input pin.  That ideal value assumes the bias currents are well-matched, which may not be true for all op-amps.<ref>http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/tutorials/MT-038.pdf</ref>\n\n==== Inverting amplifier ====\n[[Image:Op-Amp Inverting Amplifier.svg|frame|right|An op-amp connected in the inverting amplifier configuration]]\n\n''In an inverting amplifier, the output voltage changes in an opposite direction to the input voltage.''\n\nAs with the non-inverting amplifier, we start with the gain equation of the op-amp:\n\n:<math>V_{\\text{out}} = A_{OL} \\, (V_{\\!+} - V_{\\!-})</math>\n\nThis time, ''V''<sub>\u2212</sub> is a function of both ''V''<sub>out</sub> and ''V''<sub>in</sub> due to the voltage divider formed by ''R''<sub>f</sub> and ''R''<sub>in</sub>.  Again, the op-amp input does not apply an appreciable load, so:\n\n:<math>V_{\\!-} \\,\\, = \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{f}} + R_{\\text{in}}} \\left( R_\\text{f} V_{\\text{in}} + R_{\\text{in}} V_{\\text{out}} \\right) </math>\n\nSubstituting this into the gain equation and solving for <math>V_{\\text{out}}</math>:\n\n:<math>V_{\\text{out}} = - V_{\\text{in}} \\cdot \\frac {A_{OL} R_{\\text{f}}}{R_{\\text{f}} + R_{\\text{in}} + A_{OL} R_{\\text{in}}}</math>\n\nIf <math>A_{OL}</math> is very large, this simplifies to\n\n:<math>\nV_{\\text{out}}\n\\approx - V_{\\text{in}} \\frac{R_{\\text{f}}}{R_{\\text{in}}}\n</math>\n\nA resistor is often inserted between the non-inverting input and ground (so both inputs \"see\" similar resistances), reducing the [[input offset voltage]] due to different voltage drops due to [[bias current]], and may reduce distortion in some op-amps.\n\nA [[Capacitive coupling|DC-blocking]] [[capacitor]] may be inserted in series with the input resistor when a [[frequency response]] down to DC is not needed and any DC voltage on the input is unwanted. That is, the capacitive component of the input impedance inserts a DC [[complex zero|zero]] and a low-frequency [[complex pole|pole]] that gives the circuit a [[bandpass]] or [[high-pass]] characteristic.\n\nThe potentials at the operational amplifier inputs remain virtually constant (near ground) in the inverting configuration.  The constant operating potential typically results in  distortion levels that are lower than those attainable with the non-inverting topology.\n\n===Other applications===\n\n* audio- and video-frequency [[preamplifier|pre-amplifiers]] and [[Buffer amplifier|buffer]]s\n* [[differential amplifier]]s\n* [[differentiator]]s and [[integrator]]s\n* [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]]s\n* [[precision rectifier]]s\n* precision [[peak detector]]s\n* voltage and current [[Voltage regulator|regulators]]\n* analog calculators\n* [[analog to digital converter|analog-to-digital converters]]\n* [[Digital to analog converter|digital-to-analog converters]]\n* [[Clamper (electronics)|Voltage clamping]]\n* [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]]s and [[waveform generator]]s\n\nMost single, dual and quad op-amps available have a standardized pin-out which permits one type to be substituted for another without wiring changes. A specific op-amp may be chosen for its open loop gain, bandwidth, noise performance, input impedance, power consumption, or a compromise between any of these factors.\n\n==Historical timeline==\n'''1941: A vacuum tube op-amp.''' An op-amp, defined as a general-purpose, DC-coupled, high gain, inverting feedback [[amplifier]], is first found in {{US patent|2,401,779}} \"Summing Amplifier\" filed by Karl D. Swartzel Jr. of Bell Labs in 1941. This design used three [[vacuum tube]]s to achieve a gain of {{nowrap|90 dB}} and operated on voltage rails of {{nowrap|\u00b1350 V}}. It had a single inverting input rather than differential inverting and non-inverting inputs, as are common in today's op-amps. Throughout [[World War II]], Swartzel's design proved its value by being liberally used in the M9 [[Director (military)|artillery director]] designed at Bell Labs. This artillery director worked with the SCR584 [[radar]] system to achieve extraordinary hit rates (near 90%) that would not have been possible otherwise.<ref name=\"Jung-2004\">{{cite book |title=Op Amp Applications Handbook |page=777 |chapter=Chapter 8: Op Amp History |first=Walter G. |last=Jung |publisher=Newnes |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7506-7844-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dunqt1rt4sAC |accessdate=2008-11-15}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:K2-w Vacuum Tube Op-amp.jpg|right|thumb|120px|GAP/R's K2-W: a vacuum-tube op-amp (1953)]]\n\n'''1947: An op-amp with an explicit non-inverting input.''' In 1947, the operational amplifier was first formally defined and named in a paper<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ragazzini|first1=John R.|author1-link= John R.

Ragazzini]] of Columbia University. In this same paper a footnote mentioned an op-amp design by a student that would turn out to be quite significant. This op-amp, designed by [[Loebe Julie]], was superior in a variety of ways. It had two major innovations. Its input stage used a long-tailed [[triode]] pair with loads matched to reduce drift in the output and, far more importantly, it was the first op-amp design to have two inputs (one inverting, the other non-inverting). The differential input made a whole range of new functionality possible, but it would not be used for a long time due to the rise of the chopper-stabilized amplifier.<ref name=\"Jung-2004\"/>\n\n'''1949: A chopper-stabilized op-amp.''' In 1949, Edwin A. Goldberg designed a [[Chopper (electronics)|chopper]]-stabilized op-amp.<ref>http://www.analog.com/library/analogDialogue/archives/39-05/Web_ChH_final.pdf</ref> This set-up uses a normal op-amp with an additional [[Alternating current|AC]] amplifier that goes alongside the op-amp. The chopper gets an AC signal from [[Direct current|DC]] by switching between the DC voltage and ground at a fast rate (60&nbsp;Hz or 400&nbsp;Hz). This signal is then amplified, rectified, filtered and fed into the op-amp's non-inverting input. This vastly improved the gain of the op-amp while significantly reducing the output drift and DC offset. Unfortunately, any design that used a chopper couldn't use their non-inverting input for any other purpose. Nevertheless, the much improved characteristics of the chopper-stabilized op-amp made it the dominant way to use op-amps. Techniques that used the non-inverting input regularly would not be very popular until the 1960s when op-amp [[Integrated circuit|IC]]s started to show up in the field.\n\n'''1953: A commercially available op-amp.''' In 1953, vacuum tube op-amps became commercially available with the release of the model K2-W from [[George A. Philbrick]] Researches, Incorporated.  The designation on the devices shown, GAP/R, is an acronym for the complete company name. Two nine-pin [[12AX7]] vacuum tubes were mounted in an octal package and had a model K2-P chopper add-on available that would effectively \"use up\" the non-inverting input. This op-amp was based on a descendant of Loebe Julie's 1947 design and, along with its successors, would start the widespread use of op-amps in industry.\n\n[[Image:Discrete opamp.png|right|thumb|120px|GAP/R's model P45: a solid-state, discrete op-amp (1961).]]\n\n'''1961: A discrete IC op-amp.''' With the birth of the [[transistor]] in 1947, and the silicon transistor in 1954, the concept of ICs became a reality. The introduction of the [[planar process]] in 1959 made transistors and ICs stable enough to be commercially useful. By 1961, solid-state, discrete op-amps were being produced. These op-amps were effectively small circuit boards with packages such as [[edge connector]]s. They usually had hand-selected resistors in order to improve things such as voltage offset and drift. The P45 (1961) had a gain of 94&nbsp;dB and ran on \u00b115&nbsp;V rails. It was intended to deal with signals in the range of {{nowrap|\u00b110 V}}.\n\n'''1961: A varactor bridge op-amp.''' There have been many different directions taken in op-amp design. [[Varactor]] bridge op-amps started to be produced in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://www.philbrickarchive.org/ The Philbrick Archive<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>June 1961 advertisement for Philbrick P2, http://www.philbrickarchive.org/p2%20and%206033%20ad%20rsi%20vol32%20no6%20june1961.pdf</ref> They were designed to have extremely small input current and are still amongst the best op-amps available in terms of common-mode rejection with the ability to correctly deal with hundreds of volts at their inputs.\n\n[[Image:Modular opamp.png|right|thumb|120px|GAP/R's model PP65: a solid-state op-amp in a potted module (1962)]]\n\n'''1962: An op-amp in a potted module.''' By 1962, several companies were producing modular potted packages that could be plugged into [[printed circuit board]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} These packages were crucially important as they made the operational amplifier into a single [[black box]] which could be easily treated as a component in a larger circuit.\n\n'''1963: A monolithic IC op-amp.''' In 1963, the first monolithic IC op-amp, the \u03bcA702 designed by [[Bob Widlar]] at Fairchild Semiconductor, was released. Monolithic [[Integrated circuit|IC]]s consist of a single chip as opposed to a chip and discrete parts (a discrete IC) or multiple chips bonded and connected on a circuit board (a hybrid IC). Almost all modern op-amps are monolithic ICs; however, this first IC did not meet with much success. Issues such as an uneven supply voltage, low gain and a small dynamic range held off the dominance of monolithic op-amps until 1965 when the \u03bcA709<ref>A.P. Malvino, ''Electronic Principles'' (2nd Ed. 1979. ISBN 0-07-039867-4) p.&nbsp;476.</ref> (also designed by Bob Widlar) was released.\n\n'''1968: Release of the \u03bcA741.''' The popularity of monolithic op-amps was further improved upon the release of the LM101 in 1967, which solved a variety of issues, and the subsequent release of the \u03bcA741 in 1968. The \u03bcA741 was extremely similar to the LM101 except that Fairchild's facilities allowed them to include a 30&nbsp;pF compensation capacitor inside the chip instead of requiring external compensation. This simple difference has made the 741 ''the'' canonical op-amp and many modern amps base their pinout on the 741s. The \u03bcA741 is still in production, and has become ubiquitous in electronics\u2014many manufacturers produce a version of this classic chip, recognizable by part numbers containing ''741''. The same part is manufactured by several companies.\n\n'''1970: First high-speed, low-input current FET design.'''\nIn the 1970s high speed, low-input current designs started to be made by using [[Field-effect transistor|FET]]s. These would be largely replaced by op-amps made with [[MOSFET]]s in the 1980s. \n[[Image:Hybrid opamp.png|right|thumb|120px|ADI's HOS-050: a high speed hybrid IC op-amp (1979)]]\n\n'''1972: Single sided supply op-amps being produced.''' A single sided supply op-amp is one where the input and output voltages can be as low as the negative power supply voltage instead of needing to be at least two volts above it.  The result is that it can operate in many applications with the negative supply pin on the op-amp being connected to the signal ground, thus eliminating the need for a separate negative power supply.\n\nThe LM324 (released in 1972) was one such op-amp that came in a quad package (four separate op-amps in one package) and became an industry standard. In addition to packaging multiple op-amps in a single package, the 1970s also saw the birth of op-amps in hybrid packages. These op-amps were generally improved versions of existing monolithic op-amps. As the properties of monolithic op-amps improved, the more complex hybrid ICs were quickly relegated to systems that are required to have extremely long service lives or other specialty systems.\n\n[[Image:LM741CN.jpg|right|thumb|120px|An op-amp in a mini DIP package]]\n\n'''Recent trends.''' Recently supply voltages in analog circuits have decreased (as they have in digital logic) and low-voltage op-amps have been introduced reflecting this.  Supplies of 5&nbsp;V and increasingly 3.3&nbsp;V (sometimes as low as 1.8&nbsp;V) are common.  To maximize the signal range modern op-amps commonly have rail-to-rail output (the output signal can range from the lowest supply voltage to the highest) and sometimes rail-to-rail inputs.\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Active filter]]\n* [[Analog computer]]\n* [[Bob Widlar]]\n* [[Current conveyor]]\n* [[Current-feedback operational amplifier]]\n* [[Differential amplifier]]\n* [[George A.
