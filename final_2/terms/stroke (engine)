Each cycle of reciprocation consists of two opposite motions: there is a motion in one direction, and then a motion back in the opposite direction.  Each of these is called a '''stroke'''.  The term is also used to mean the length of the stroke.\n\nIn a [[steam locomotive]], or in a [[Steam engine|steam]], [[Otto cycle|Otto]], [[Diesel engine|Diesel]] or [[piston engine]], a stroke is the action of a [[piston]] travelling the full length of its [[Cylinder (locomotive)|locomotive cylinder]] or [[Cylinder (engine)|engine cylinder]] in one direction.\n\nThe stroke length is determined by the [[crank (mechanism)|cranks]] on the [[crankshaft]]. Stroke can also refer to the distance the piston travels. [[Engine displacement]] is dependent on both the [[diameter]] of the cylinder, known as its [[Bore (engine)|bore]], and the stroke of the Piston.\n\nIn a [[pistonless rotary engine]], the term is applied to the corresponding rotor movement; see [[Dead centre (engineering)|Dead centre]].\n\n==Four-stroke  internal combustion engine== \n{{main article|Four-stroke engine}}\nMost modern internal combustion engines work on a four-stroke cycle; that is, a complete cylinder cycle consists of four discrete strokes, as described below. Other types of engines can have very different stroke cycles.\n\n===Induction/Intake stroke===\nThe '''induction stroke''' is the first stroke in a four-stroke internal combustion engine cycle. It involves the downward movement of the [[piston]], creating a partial vacuum that draws (allows atmospheric pressure to push) a fuel/air mixture into the combustion chamber.\n\nIn a reciprocating engine, it is that portion of the cycle when the pistons move from TDC (top dead center) to BDC (bottom dead center) and the fuel-air mixture is drawn into the cylinders....\n\nThis is a cylinder for a 4-stroke Petrol/Gasoline engine. The first step is to get the air-fuel mixture into the chamber. Mixture enters through an inlet port that is opened and closed by an inlet valve. This is called Intake\n\n===Compression stroke===\nThe '''compression stroke''' is the second of four stages in an [[otto cycle]] or [[diesel cycle]] [[internal combustion engine]].\n\nIn this stage, the mixture (in the case of an Otto engine) or air (in the case of a Diesel engine) is [[Gas compressor|compressed]] to the top of the [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] by the [[piston]] until it is either ignited by a [[spark plug]] in an Otto engine or, in the case of a Diesel engine, by  the  fuel being injected into the compressed  (and  thereby  heated)  air, forcing the piston back down. In a Diesel engine, the injection of fuel usually leads [[Top dead center#Reciprocating engine|top dead center]] by about 4 mechanical degrees, this \"lead\" being intended to allow complete fuel ignition to occur slightly after top dead center.\n\nCompression serves to increase the proportion of energy which can be extracted from the hot gas and should be optimised for a given application. Too high a compression can cause detonation, which is undesirable compared with a smooth, controlled burn. Too low a compression may result in the fuel/air mixture still burning when the piston reaches the bottom of the stroke and the exhaust valve opens.\n\n===Combustion/Power/Expansion stroke===\nA '''power stroke''' is, in general, the stroke or movement of a cyclic motor while generating [[force (physics)|force]] and thus power. It is used in describing mechanical engines. This force is the result of the spark plug igniting the compressed fuel-air mixture (in Petrol Engines).\n\n===Exhaust stroke=== \nThe '''exhaust stroke''' is the fourth of four stages in a |four stroke [[internal combustion engine]] cycle. In this stage gases remaining in the cylinder from the [[fuel]] ignited during the compression step are removed from the [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] through an exhaust [[Poppet valve|valve]] at the top of the cylinder. The gases are forced up to the top of the cylinder as the piston rises and are pushed through the opening, which then closes to allow a fresh air/fuel mixture into the cylinder so the process can repeat itself.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Compression ratio]]\n*[[Cylinder head porting]]\n*[[Two-stroke cycle]]\n\n{{Piston engine configurations |uncollapsed}}\n{{Automotive engine}}\n{{Aircraft piston engine components}}\n{{Steam engine configurations}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stroke (Engine)}}\n[[Category:Engine technology]]\n\n[[de:Hub (Mechanik)]]"}]}}}}
