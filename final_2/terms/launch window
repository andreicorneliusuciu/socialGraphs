If the rocket is not launched within this time period, it has to wait for the next window.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/brainbites/nonflash/bb_home_launchwindow.html What is a launch window?]</ref>\n\nFor trips into largely arbitrary [[Earth orbit]]s, no specific launch time is required. But if the spacecraft intends to [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] with an object already in orbit, the launch must be carefully timed to occur around the times that the target vehicle's [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] intersects the launch site.\n\n[[Earth observation satellite|Earth observation satellites]] are often launched into [[Sun-synchronous orbit|sun-synchronous orbits]] which are [[Polar orbit|near-polar]]. For these orbits, the launch window occurs at the time of day when the launch site location is aligned with the plane of the required orbit. To launch at another time would require an orbital plane change [[Orbital maneuver|maneuver]] which would require a large amount of propellant.\n\nFor launches above [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO), the actual launch time can be somewhat flexible if a [[parking orbit]] is used, because the inclination and time the spacecraft initially spends in the parking orbit can be varied. See the launch window used by the ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]'' spacecraft to the planet [[Mars]] at [http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/overvu/delta/window/window.html].\n\nTo go to another planet using the simple low-energy [[Hohmann transfer orbit]], if eccentricity of orbits is not a factor, launch windows are periodic according to the [[synodic period]]; for example, in the case of Mars, the period is 2.135 years, (780 days). In more complex cases, including the use of [[gravitational slingshot]]s, launch windows are irregular. Sometimes rare opportunities arise, such as when ''[[Voyager 2]]'' took advantage of a 175-year planetary alignment (launch window) to visit [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]].  When such an opportunity is missed, another target may be selected. For example, the [[European Space Agency|ESA]]'s ''[[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]]'' mission was originally intended for comet [[46P/Wirtanen]], but a launcher problem delayed it and a new target had to be selected (comet [[67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko]]).\n\nLaunch windows are often calculated from [[porkchop plot]]s, which  show the [[delta-v]] needed to achieve the mission plotted against the launch time.\n\n==Specific issues==\n[[Space Shuttle]] missions to the [[International Space Station]] were restricted by [[beta angle]] cutout. Beta angle (<math>\\beta</math>) is defined as the angle between the orbit plane and the vector from the Sun.<ref name=\"knk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tak2000.com/data/planets/earth.htm|title=  Earth's Thermal Environment|last=K&K Associates|year=2008|work=Thermal Environments JPL D-8160|publisher=K&K Associates|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}</ref> Due to the relationship between an orbiting object's beta angle (in this case, the ISS) and the percent of its orbit that is spent in sunlight, solar power generation and thermal control are affected by that beta angle.<ref name=\"mcc\">{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/feedback/expert/answer/mcc/sts-113/11_23_20_01_179.html|title=MCC Answers|author=Derek Hassman, NASA Flight Director|date=December 1, 2002|publisher=NASA|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}</ref> Shuttle launches to the ISS were normally only attempted when the ISS was in an orbit with a beta angle of less than 60 degrees.<ref name=\"mcc\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Beta angle]]\n*[[Collision avoidance (spacecraft)]]\n*[[Delta-v budget]]\n*[[Interplanetary travel]]\n*[[Oberth effect]]\n\n{{Wiktionary|window of opportunity}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Orbits}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Launch Window}}\n[[Category:Spaceflight concepts]]"}]}}}}
