MLS has a number of operational advantages, including a wide selection of channels to avoid interference with other nearby airports, excellent performance in all weather, a small \"footprint\" at the airports, and wide vertical and horizontal \"capture\" angles that allowed approaches from wider areas around the airport.\n\nAlthough some MLS systems became operational in the 1990s, the widespread deployment initially envisioned by its designers never became a reality. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]-based systems, notably [[Wide Area Augmentation System|WAAS]], allowed the expectation of the same level of positioning detail with no equipment needed at the [[airport]]. GPS/WAAS dramatically lowers the cost of implementing precision landing approaches, and since its introduction most existing MLS systems in North America have been turned off. GPS/WAAS-based [[Localizer Performance with Vertical guidance|LPV]] 'Localizer Performance with Vertical guidance' approaches provide vertical guidance comparable to ILS Category I and FAA-published LPV approaches currently outnumber ILS approaches at US airports.    \n\nThough initially MLS appeared to be of interest in Europe, where concerns over the availability of GPS were an issue, the widespread installation never occurred.  The likely further deployment of the system is in doubt. [[NASA]] operated a similar system called the [[Microwave Scanning Beam Landing System]] to land the [[Space Shuttle orbiter]].\n\n==Principle==\nMLS employs 5&nbsp;GHz transmitters at the landing place which use [[passive electronically scanned array]]s to send scanning beams towards approaching aircraft. An aircraft that enters the scanned volume uses a special receiver that calculates its position by measuring the arrival times of the beams.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2006}}\nThe US version of MLS, a joint development between the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]], [[NASA]], and the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]], was designed to provide precision navigation guidance for exact alignment and descent of aircraft on approach to a runway. It provides azimuth, elevation, and distance, as well as \"back azimuth\" for navigating away from an aborted landing or missed approach. MLS channels were also used for short-range communications with airport controllers, allowing long-distance frequencies to be handed over to other aircraft.\n\nIn [[Australia]], design work commenced on a version of MLS in 1972.  Most of this work was done jointly by the Federal Department of Civil Aviation (DCA), and the Radio Physics Division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ([[CSIRO]]).  The project was called Interscan, one of several microwave landing systems under consideration internationally. Interscan was chosen by the [[FAA]] in 1975 and by [[ICAO]] in 1978 as the format to be adopted. An engineered version of the system, called MITAN, was developed by industry ([[Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited]] and Hawker [[de Havilland]]) under a contract with DCA's successor, the Department of Transport, and successfully demonstrated at [[Melbourne Airport]] (Tullamarine) in the late 1970s. The white antenna dishes could still be seen at Tullamarine until 2003 when they were dismantled.\n\nThis initial research was followed by the formation of Interscan International limited in Sydney, Australia in 1979 which manufactured MLS systems that were subsequently deployed in the US, EU, Taiwan, China and Australia. The [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)]] developed a version of MLS, which is installed at [[Heathrow Airport]] and other airports, because of the greater incidence of instrument approaches with Cat II/III weather.\n\n[[Image:MLS Azimuth Guidance.jpg|thumb|300px|An MLS azimuth guidance station with rectangular azimuth scanning antenna with DME antenna at left.]]\nCompared with the existing [[instrument landing system|ILS]] system, MLS had significant advantages. The antennas were much smaller, using a higher frequency signal. They also did not have to be placed at a specific location at the airport, and could \"offset\" their signals electronically. This made placement easier compared with the physically larger ILS systems, which ''had to be placed at the ends of the runways and along the approach path''.\n\nAnother advantage was that the MLS signals covered a very wide fan-shaped area off the end of the runway, allowing controllers to direct aircraft approaching from a variety of directions or guide aircraft along a segmented approach. In comparison, ILS could only guide the aircraft down a single straight line, requiring controllers to distribute planes along that line. MLS allowed aircraft to approach from whatever direction they were already flying in, as opposed to flying to a parking orbit before \"capturing\" the ILS signal. This was particularly valuable at larger airports, as it could allow the aircraft to be separated horizontally much closer to the airport. Similarly in elevation, the fan shaped coverage allows for variations in descent rate, making MLS useful for aircraft with steeper approach angles such as helicopters, fighters and the space shuttle.\n\n[[Image:MLS Elevation Guidance.jpg|thumb|300px|left|An MLS elevation guidance station.]]\nUnlike ILS, which required a variety of frequencies to broadcast the various signals, MLS used a single frequency, broadcasting the azimuth and altitude information one after the other. This reduced the chance of frequency conflicts, as did the fact that the frequencies used were far away from [[FM broadcasting|FM]] broadcasts, another problem with ILS. MLS also offered two hundred separate channels, making conflicts between airports in the same area easily preventable.\n\nFinally, the accuracy was greatly improved over ILS. For instance, standard [[Distance Measuring Equipment|DME]] equipment used with ILS offered range accuracy of only \u00b11200 feet. MLS improved this to \u00b1100&nbsp;ft in what they referred to as DME/P (for precision), and offered similar improvements in azimuth and altitude. This allowed MLS to guide extremely accurate CAT III approaches, whereas this normally required an expensive ground-based high precision radar.\n\nSimilar to other precision landing systems, lateral and vertical guidance may be displayed on conventional course deviation indicators or incorporated into multipurpose cockpit displays. Range information can also be displayed by conventional DME indicators and also incorporated into multipurpose displays.\n\nIt was originally intended that ILS would remain in operation until 2010 before being replaced by MLS. The system was only being installed experimentally in the 1980s when the FAA began to favor GPS. Even in the worst cases, GPS offered at least 300&nbsp;ft accuracy, not as good as MLS, but much better than ILS. GPS also worked \"everywhere\", not just off the end of the runways. This meant that a single navigation instrument could replace both short and long-range navigation systems, offer better accuracy than either, and required no ground-based equipment.\n\nThe performance of GPS, namely vertical guidance accuracy near the runway threshold and the integrity of the system have not been able to match historical ICAO standards and practices. Greater GPS accuracy could be provided by sending out \"correcting signals\" from ground-based stations, which would improve the accuracy to about 10 m in the worst case, far outperforming MLS. Initially it was planned to send these signals out over short-range [[FM broadcasting|FM transmissions]] on commercial radio frequencies, but this proved to be too difficult to arrange. Today a similar signal is instead sent across all of North America via commercial satellites, in a system known as [[Wide Area Augmentation System|WAAS]]. However WAAS is not capable of providing CAT II or CAT III standard signals (those required for autolanding) and so a [[Local Area Augmentation System]], or LAAS, must be used.\n\n==Operational Functions==\n\nThe system may be divided into five functions: Approach azimuth, Back azimuth, Approach elevation, Range and Data communications.\n[[File:Microwave Landing System.svg|thumb|FIG 1-1-10 Coverage Volumes 3-D Representation]]\n\n===Approach azimuth guidance===\n[[Image:F0101008.gif|thumb|FIG 1-1-8 Coverage Volume of the Azimuth station]]\n[[Image:AIMFig 1 1 19.gif|thumb|right|FIG 1-1-9 Coverage Volumes of the Elevation station]]\n\nThe azimuth station transmits MLS angle and data on one of 200 channels within the frequency range of 5031 to 5091&nbsp;MHz and is normally located about 1,000 feet (300 m) beyond the stop end of the runway, but there is considerable flexibility in selecting sites. For example, for heliport operations the azimuth transmitter can be collocated with the elevation transmitter. \n\nThe azimuth coverage extends: Laterally, at least 40 degrees on either side of the runway centerline in a standard configuration. In elevation, up to an angle of 15 degrees and to at least 20,000 feet (6&nbsp;km), and in range, to at least 20 nautical miles (37&nbsp;km) (See FIG 1-1-8.)\n\n===Elevation guidance===\nThe elevation station transmits signals on the same frequency as the azimuth station. A single frequency is time-shared between angle and data functions and is normally located about 400 feet from the side of the runway between runway threshold and the touchdown zone.\n\nElevation coverage is provided in the same airspace as the azimuth guidance signals: In elevation, to at least +15 degrees; Laterally, to fill the Azimuth lateral coverage and in range, to at least 20 nautical miles (37&nbsp;km) (See FIG 1-1-9.)\n\n===Range guidance===\nThe MLS Precision [[Distance Measuring Equipment]] (DME/P) functions in the same way as the navigation DME, but there are some technical differences. The beacon transponder operates in the frequency band 962 to 1105&nbsp;MHz and responds to an aircraft interrogator. The MLS DME/P accuracy is improved to be consistent with the accuracy provided by the MLS azimuth and elevation stations. \n\nA DME/P channel is paired with the azimuth and elevation channel. A complete listing of the 200 paired channels of the DME/P with the angle functions is contained in FAA Standard 022 (MLS Interoperability and Performance Requirements). \n\nThe DME/N or DME/P is an integral part of the MLS and is installed at all MLS facilities unless a waiver is obtained. This occurs infrequently and only at outlying, low density airports where [[marker beacon]]s or [[Non-directional beacon|compass locator]]s are already in place.\n\n===Data communications===\n\nThe data transmission can include both the basic and auxiliary data words. All MLS facilities transmit basic data. Where needed, auxiliary data can be transmitted. MLS data are transmitted throughout the azimuth (and back azimuth when provided) coverage sectors. Representative data include: Station identification, Exact locations of azimuth, elevation and DME/P stations (for MLS receiver processing functions), Ground equipment performance level; and DME/P channel and status. \n\nMLS identification is a four-letter designation starting with the letter M. It is transmitted in [[morse code|International Morse Code]] at least six times per minute by the approach azimuth (and back azimuth) ground equipment.<ref>[http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/ATpubs/AIM/Chap1/aim0101.html see section 1-1-11. Microwave Landing System (MLS)]</ref>\n\nAuxiliary data content: Representative data include: 3-D locations of MLS equipment, Waypoint coordinates, Runway conditions and Weather (e.g., RVR, ceiling, altimeter setting, wind, wake vortex, wind shear).\n\n== Future ==\n\nIn the United States, the FAA suspended the MLS program in 1994 in favor of the GPS ([[Wide Area Augmentation System]] WAAS). The FAA's inventory of instrument flight procedures no longer includes any MLS locations;<ref>[http://avn.faa.gov/index.asp?xml=nfpo/inventory-summary Aeronautical Navigation Products \u2013 AJV-3]</ref> the last two were eliminated in 2008. \n\nDue to different operational conditions in Europe many countries (particularly those known for low visibility conditions) were expected to embrace the MLS system as a replacement to ILS. However, in reality the only major installation was London Heathrow [[Heathrow Airport|LHR]]. Other major airports, such as [[Frankfurt Airport]] which were expected to install MLS have instead published [[Ground-based augmentation system|GBAS]] approaches. <ref>http://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/publication/files/2015-GBAS-factsheet.pdf</ref>\n\nAs more GBAS system are installed then the further installation of MLS or continued operation of existing systems must be in doubt.<ref>http://www.eurocontrol.int/gsearch/microwave%20landing%20system</ref>\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Instrument Landing System|Instrument Landing System (ILS)]]\n*[[Local Area Augmentation System|Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS)]]\n*[[Tactical air navigation system]] (TACAN)\n*[[Transponder Landing System|Transponder Landing System (TLS)]]\n*[[Wide Area Augmentation System|Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)]]\n*[[Microwave Scanning Beam Landing System]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*[http://www.faa.gov/atpubs/AIM/Chap1/aim0101.html Aeronautical Information Manual]\n*[http://www.aviationtoday.com/av/issue/feature/807.html Aviation Today] ''MLS: Back to the Future?''
