The controlled synthesis of materials as thin films (a process referred\nto as deposition) is a fundamental step in many applications. A familiar example is the household [[mirror]], which typically has a thin metal coating on the back of a sheet of glass to form a reflective interface. The process of [[silvering]] was once commonly used to produce mirrors, while more recently the metal layer is deposited using techniques such as [[sputtering]]. Advances in thin film deposition techniques during the 20th century have enabled a wide range of technological breakthroughs in areas such as [[Magnetic media|magnetic recording media]], [[Semiconductor device|electronic semiconductor devices]], [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]], [[optical coating]]s (such as [[antireflective]] coatings), hard coatings on cutting tools, and for both energy generation (e.g.  [[thin film solar cell]]s) and storage ([[Thin-film battery|thin-film batteries]]). It is also being applied to\npharmaceuticals, via [[thin-film drug delivery]].\n\nIn addition to their applied interest, thin films play an important role in the development and study of materials with new and\nunique properties. Examples include [[multiferroics|multiferroic materials]], and [[superlattice]]s that allow the study of\n[[quantum confinement]] by creating two-dimensional electron states.\n\n==Deposition==\nThe act of applying a thin film to a surface is ''thin-film deposition'' \u2013 any technique for depositing a thin film of material onto a [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] or onto previously deposited layers. \"Thin\" is a relative term, but most deposition techniques control layer thickness within a few tens of [[nanometre]]s. [[Molecular beam epitaxy]] and [[atomic layer deposition]] allow a single layer of [[atom]]s to be deposited at a time.\n\nIt is useful in the manufacture of [[optics]] (for [[Reflection (physics)|reflective]], [[anti-reflective coating]]s or [[self-cleaning glass]], for instance), [[electronics]] (layers of [[Electrical insulation|insulator]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, and [[conductor (material)|conductor]]s form [[integrated circuits]]), [[packaging]] (i.e., [[metallized polyethylene terephthalate|aluminium-coated PET film]]), and in [[contemporary art]] (see the work of [[Larry bell (artist)|Larry Bell]]). Similar processes are sometimes used where thickness is not important: for instance, the purification of [[copper]] by [[electroplating]], and the deposition of [[silicon]] and enriched [[uranium]] by a [[Chemical vapor deposition|CVD]]-like process after gas-phase processing.\n\nDeposition techniques fall into two broad categories, depending on whether the process is primarily [[chemistry|chemical]] or [[physics|physical]].<ref>''Functional Polymer Films'' Eds. R. Advincula and W. Knoll \u2013 Wiley, 2011, ISBN 978-3527321902.</ref>\n\n===Chemical deposition===\nHere, a fluid [[wikt:Precursor|precursor]] undergoes a chemical change at a solid surface, leaving a solid layer. An everyday example is the formation of soot on a cool object when it is placed inside a flame. Since the fluid surrounds the solid object, deposition happens on every surface, with little regard to direction; thin films from chemical deposition techniques tend to be ''[[conformal film|conformal]]'', rather than ''directional''.\n\nChemical deposition is further categorized by the phase of the precursor:\n\n[[Plating]] relies on liquid precursors, often a solution of water with a [[salt]] of the metal to be deposited. Some plating processes are driven entirely by [[reagent]]s in the solution (usually for [[noble metal]]s), but by far the most commercially important process is [[electroplating]]. It was not commonly used in semiconductor processing for many years, but has seen a resurgence with more widespread use of [[chemical-mechanical polishing]] techniques.\n\n[[Sol-gel|Chemical solution deposition]] (CSD) or [[chemical bath deposition]] (CBD) uses a liquid precursor, usually a solution of [[organometallic]] powders dissolved in an organic solvent. This is a relatively inexpensive, simple thin film process that is able to produce stoichiometrically accurate crystalline phases. This technique is also known as the '''[[sol-gel]]''' method because the 'sol' (or solution) gradually evolves towards the formation of a gel-like diphasic system.\n\n[[Spin coating]] or spin casting, uses a liquid precursor, or [[sol-gel]] precursor deposited onto a smooth, flat substrate which is subsequently spun at a high velocity to centrifugally spread the solution over the substrate. The speed at which the solution is spun and the [[viscosity]] of the sol determine the ultimate thickness of the deposited film. Repeated depositions can be carried out to increase the thickness of films as desired. Thermal treatment is often carried out in order to crystallize the amorphous spin coated film. Such crystalline films can exhibit certain preferred orientations after crystallization on single crystal substrates.<ref>{{cite journal |first=D |last=Hanaor |author2=Triani G.; Sorrell C.C.; |title=Morphology and photocatalytic activity of highly oriented mixed phase titanium dioxide thin films |journal=Surface and Coatings Technology: |volume=205|issue=12 |pages=3658\u20133664 |year=2011| doi = 10.1016/j.surfcoat.2011.01.007}}</ref>\n\n[[Dip-coating|Dip coating]] is similar to spin coating in that a liquid precursor or sol-gel precursor is deposited on a substrate, but in this case the substrate is completely submerged in the solution and then withdrawn under controlled conditions. By controlling the withdrawal speed, the evaporation conditions (principally the humidity, temperature) and the volatility/viscosity of the solvent, the film thickness, homogeneity and nanoscopic morphology are controlled. There are two evaporation regimes: the capillary zone at very low withdrawal speeds, and the draining zone at faster evaporation speeds.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=M. Faustini, G. L. Drisko, C.

Grosso Liquid deposition approaches to self-assembled periodic nanomasks, Scripta Materiala 2014.|journal=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256103949_Liquid_deposition_approaches_to_self-assembled_periodic_nanomasks|volume=}}</ref>\n  \n[[Chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD) generally uses a gas-phase precursor, often a [[halide]] or [[hydride]] of the element to be deposited. In the case of [[Metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy|MOCVD]], an [[organometallic]] gas is used. Commercial techniques often use very low pressures of precursor gas.\n\n[[Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition|Plasma enhanced CVD]] (PECVD) uses an ionized vapor, or [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], as a precursor. Unlike the soot example above, commercial PECVD relies on electromagnetic means (electric current, [[microwave]] excitation), rather than a chemical reaction, to produce a plasma.\n\n[[Atomic layer deposition]] (ALD) uses gaseous precursor to deposit [[conformal film|conformal]] thin films one layer at a time.  The process is split up into two half reactions, run in sequence and repeated for each layer, in order to ensure total layer saturation before beginning the next layer.  Therefore, one reactant is deposited first, and then the second reactant is deposited, during which a chemical reaction occurs on the substrate, forming the desired composition.  As a result of the stepwise, the process is slower than CVD, however it can be run at low temperatures, unlike CVD.\n\n===Physical deposition===\nPhysical deposition uses mechanical, electromechanical or thermodynamic means to produce a thin film of solid. An everyday example is the formation of [[frost]]. Since most engineering materials are held together by relatively high energies, and chemical reactions are not used to store these energies, commercial physical deposition systems tend to require a low-pressure vapor environment to function properly; most can be classified as [[physical vapor deposition]] (PVD).\n\nThe material to be deposited is placed in an [[energy|energetic]], [[entropy|entropic]] environment, so that particles of material escape its surface. Facing this source is a cooler surface which draws energy from these particles as they arrive, allowing them to form a solid layer. The whole system is kept in a vacuum deposition chamber, to allow the particles to travel as freely as possible. Since particles tend to follow a straight path, films deposited by physical means are commonly ''directional'', rather than ''conformal''.\n\nExamples of physical deposition include:\nA thermal [[evaporation (deposition)|evaporator]] that uses an electric resistance heater to melt the material and raise its vapor pressure to a useful range. This is done in a high vacuum, both to allow the vapor to reach the substrate without reacting with or [[scattering]] against other gas-phase atoms in the chamber, and reduce the incorporation of impurities from the residual gas in the vacuum chamber. Obviously, only materials with a much higher [[vapor pressure]] than the [[heating element]] can be deposited without contamination of the film. [[Molecular beam epitaxy]] is a particularly sophisticated form of thermal evaporation.\n\nAn [[electron beam physical vapor deposition|electron beam evaporator]] fires a high-energy beam from an [[electron gun]] to boil a small spot of material; since the heating is not uniform, lower [[vapor pressure]] materials can be deposited. The beam is usually bent through an angle of 270\u00b0 in order to ensure that the gun filament is not directly exposed to the evaporant flux. Typical deposition rates for electron beam evaporation range from 1 to 10 nanometres per second.\n\nIn [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE), slow streams of an element can be directed at the substrate, so that material deposits one atomic layer at a time. Compounds such as [[gallium arsenide]] are usually deposited by repeatedly applying a layer of one element (i.e., [[gallium]]), then a layer of the other (i.e., [[arsenic]]), so that the process is chemical, as well as physical. The beam of material can be generated by either physical means (that is, by a [[furnace]]) or by a chemical reaction ([[chemical beam epitaxy]]).\n\n[[Sputtering]] relies on a plasma (usually a [[noble gas]], such as [[argon]]) to knock material from a \"target\" a few atoms at a time. The target can be kept at a relatively low temperature, since the process is not one of evaporation, making this one of the most flexible deposition techniques. It is especially useful for compounds or mixtures, where different components would otherwise tend to evaporate at different rates. Note, sputtering's step coverage is more or less conformal. It is also widely used in the optical media. The manufacturing of all formats of CD, DVD, and BD are done with the help of this technique. It is a fast technique and also it provides a good thickness control.  Presently, nitrogen and oxygen gases are also being used in sputtering.\n\n[[Pulsed laser deposition]] systems work by an [[ablation]] process. Pulses of focused [[laser]] light vaporize the surface of the target material and convert it to plasma; this plasma usually reverts to a gas before it reaches the substrate.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rashidian Vaziri|first1=M R|title=Monte Carlo simulation of the subsurface growth mode during pulsed laser deposition|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=110|page=043304|doi=10.1063/1.3624768|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jap/110/4/10.1063/1.3624768}}</ref>\n\n[[Cathodic arc deposition]] (arc-PVD) which is a kind of [[ion beam deposition]] where an electrical arc is created that literally blasts ions from the cathode. The arc has an extremely high [[power density]] resulting in a high level of [[ionization]] (30\u2013100%), multiply charged ions, neutral particles, clusters and macro-particles (droplets). If a reactive gas is introduced during the evaporation process, [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]], [[ionization]] and [[Excited state|excitation]] can occur during interaction with the [[ion flux]] and a compound film will be deposited.\n\n[[Electrohydrodynamic]] deposition (electrospray deposition) is a relatively new process of thin film deposition. The liquid to be deposited, either in the form of nano-particle solution or simply a solution, is fed to a small capillary nozzle (usually metallic) which is connected to a high voltage. The substrate on which the film has to be deposited is connected to ground. Through the influence of electric field, the liquid coming out of the nozzle takes a conical shape ([[Taylor cone]]) and at the apex of the cone a thin jet emanates which disintegrates into very fine and small positively charged droplets under the influence of Rayleigh charge limit. The droplets keep getting smaller and smaller and  ultimately get deposited on the substrate as a uniform thin layer.\n\n===Growth modes===\n[[Image:Frank-van-der-Merwe-Modus.svg|thumb|Frank-van-der-Merwe mode]]\n[[Image:Stranski-Krastanow-Modus.svg|thumb|Stranski-Krastanow mode]]\n[[Image:Volmer-Weber-Modus.svg|thumb|Volmer-Weber mode]]\n\nFrank-van-der-Merwe<ref>{{cite journal |first=F.

The term epitaxy comes from the Greek roots epi (\u1f10\u03c0\u03af), meaning \"above\", and taxis (\u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b9\u03c2), meaning \"an ordered manner\". It can be translated as \"arranging upon\".\n\nThe term '''homoepitaxy''' refers to the specific case in which a film of the same material is grown on a crystalline\nsubstrate. This technology is used, for instance, to grow a film which is more pure than the substrate, has a lower density\nof defects, and to fabricate layers having different doping levels. '''Heteroepitaxy''' refers to the case in which the film being deposited is different than the substrate.\n\nTechniques used for epitaxial growth of thin films include [[molecular beam epitaxy]], [[chemical vapor deposition]],\nand [[pulsed laser deposition]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vaziri et al.|first1=M R R|title=Microscopic description of the thermalization process during pulsed laser deposition of aluminium in the presence of argon background gas|journal=Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics|volume=43|page=425205|doi=10.1088/0022-3727/43/42/425205|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3727/43/42/425205/meta#}}</ref>\n\n== Thin-film photovoltaic cells ==\n\n{{Further information|Thin film solar cell}}\n\nThin-film technologies are also being developed as a means of substantially reducing the cost of [[solar cells]]. The rationale for this is [[thin film solar cell]]s are cheaper to manufacture owing to their reduced material costs, energy costs, handling costs and capital costs. This is especially represented in the use of [[printed electronics]] ([[roll-to-roll]]) processes. Other thin-film technologies, that are still in an early stage of ongoing research or with limited commercial availability, are often classified as emerging or [[third generation photovoltaic cell]]s and include, [[Organic solar cell|organic]], [[Dye-sensitized solar cell|dye-sensitized]], and [[polymer solar cell]]s, as well as [[Quantum dot solar cell|quantum dot]], [[Copper zinc tin sulfide solar cell|copper zinc tin sulfide]], [[Nanocrystal solar cell|nanocrystal]] and [[perovskite solar cell]]s.\n\n==Thin-film batteries==\n[[Printed electronics|Thin-film printing technology]] is being used to apply solid-state [[lithium polymer]]s to a variety of [[Substrate (printing)|substrates]] to create unique batteries for specialized applications. [[Thin-film battery|Thin-film batteries]] can be deposited directly onto chips or chip packages in any shape or size. Flexible batteries can be made by printing onto plastic, thin metal foil, or paper.<ref>[http://www.mpoweruk.com/cell_construction.htm#flexible Flexible Cell Construction]. Mpoweruk.com.
