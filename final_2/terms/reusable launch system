This contrasts with [[expendable launch system]]s, where each launch vehicle is launched once and then discarded.\n\nNo completely reusable [[Orbital spaceflight|orbital]] launch system has ever been created; however, several partially reusable launch systems have existed. The [[Space Shuttle]] was partially reusable: the orbiter, which included the [[Space Shuttle main engine]]s, and the two [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]]s, were reused after several months of refitting work for each launch. However, the [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]] and launch vehicle [[Rigid frame|load frame]] were discarded after each flight.<ref name=nasaStudy1982/><ref name=nasaStudy1980/> \n\nThe [[Falcon 9]] rocket is designed to have a reusable [[first stage (rocketry)|first stage]]; several of these stages have been safely returned to land after launch. However, as of 2016, none of these first stages have yet been reused.\n\nSeveral partially reusable systems, such as [[Adeline (rocket)|Adeline]] and [[Vulcan (rocket)|Vulcan]], are currently under development; one fully reusable system, the [[Interplanetary Transport System]], is also under development.\n\nOrbital RLVs are thought to provide the possibility of low cost and highly reliable access to space. However, reusability implies weight penalties such as non-[[Atmospheric reentry#Ablative|ablative]] [[Atmospheric reentry|reentry]] shielding and possibly a stronger structure to survive multiple uses, and given the lack of experience with these vehicles, the actual costs and reliability are yet to be seen.\n\n==History==\n[[File:rombus.jpg|right|thumb|250px|ROMBUS]]\n[[File:Aerospaceplane.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Aerospaceplane]] 1]]\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, popular science fiction often depicted [[space vehicle]]s as either single-stage reusable [[space vehicle#Visionary space ships|rocket ship]]s which could launch and land vertically ([[SSTO]] [[VTVL]]), or single-stage reusable [[rocket-powered aircraft|rocket plane]]s which could launch and land horizontally (SSTO [[HTHL]]).\n\nThe realities of early engine technology with low [[specific impulse]] or insufficient [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] to escape Earth's [[gravity well]], compounded by construction materials without adequate performance ([[strength of materials|strength]], [[stiffness]], heat resistance) and low weight, seemingly rendered that original single-stage reusable vehicle vision impossible.\n\nHowever, advances in materials and engine technology have rendered this concept potentially feasible.\n\nBefore VTVL SSTO designs came the partially reusable multi-stage [[NEXUS (launch vehicle)|NEXUS]] launcher by [[Krafft Arnold Ehricke]]. The pioneer in the field of VTVL SSTO, [[Philip Bono]], worked at [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]]. Bono proposed several launch vehicles including: [http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/roost.htm ROOST], [http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/rombus.htm ROMBUS], [http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/ithacus.htm Ithacus], [http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/pegvtovl.htm Pegasus] and [[Douglas SASSTO|SASSTO]]. Most of his vehicles combined similar innovations to achieve SSTO capability. Bono proposed:\n* [[Plug nozzle]] engines to retain high specific impulse at all altitudes.\n* Base first reentry which allowed the reuse of the engine as a heat shield, lowering required heat shield mass.\n* Use of [[spherical]] tanks and stubby shape to reduce vehicle structural mass further.\n* Use of drop tanks to increase range.\n* Use of in-orbit refueling to increase range.\n\nBono also proposed the use of his vehicles for space launch, rapid intercontinental military transport (Ithacus), rapid intercontinental civilian transport (Pegasus), even Moon and Mars missions ([http://www.astronautix.com/craft/proelena.htm Project Selena], [http://www.astronautix.com/craft/proeimos.htm Project Deimos]).\n\nIn Europe, Dietrich Koelle, inspired by Bono's SASSTO design, proposed his own VTVL vehicle named [http://www.spacefuture.com/archive/beta_a_single_stage_reusable_ballistic_space_shuttle_concept.shtml BETA].\n\nBefore HTHL SSTO designs came [[Eugen S\u00e4nger]] and his [[Silbervogel]] (\"Silverbird\") [[suborbital]] skip bomber. HTHL vehicles which can reach [[Orbital speed|orbital velocity]] are harder to design than VTVL due to their higher vehicle structural weight. This led to several multi-stage prototypes such as a [[suborbital]] [[X-15]]. [[Aerospaceplane]] being one of the first HTHL SSTO concepts. Proposals have been made to make such a vehicle more viable including:\n* [[Rocket sled launch|Rail boost]] (e.g. 270&nbsp;m/s at 3000 m on a mountain allowing 35% less [[SSTO]] takeoff mass for a given payload in one NASA study)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=24756.0;attach=288934|title=The Maglifter: An Advanced Concept Using Electromagnetic Propulsion in Reducing the Cost of Space Launch|publisher=NASA|accessdate=24 May 2011}}</ref>\n* Use of [[lifting body]] designs to reduce vehicle structural mass.\n* Use of in-flight refueling.\n\nOther launch system configuration designs are possible such as horizontal launch with vertical landing ([[HTVL]]) and vertical launch with horizontal landing ([[VTHL]]). One of the few HTVL vehicles is the 1960s concept spacecraft Hyperion SSTO, designed by Philip Bono.<ref name=as1999>\n{{cite web |last=Wade|first=Mark |title=Hyperion SSTO |url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/hypnssto.htm |publisher=Astronautix |accessdate=2011-02-06 |quote=''The 'Hyperion' vehicle was truly remarkable since it would have been launched horizontally and landed vertically (HTVL) \u2014 an extremely rare combination.

From an initial multitude of ideas a two-stage reusable [[VTHL]] design was pushed forward that eventually resulted in a reusable orbiter payload spacecraft and reusable [[solid rocket]] boosters.\nThe [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]] and the launch vehicle [[Rigid frame|load frame]] were discarded, and the parts that were reusable took a 10,000-person group nine months to refurbish for flight. The space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/elon_musk_the_mind_behind_tesla_spacex_solarcity/transcript?utm_content=buffer5c917&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer|title=Elon Musk: The mind behind Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity ... - TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript - TED.com|author=Elon Musk|publisher=}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=TED talks are meant to foster entertainment rather than scholarship; Musk, with his vested interest, is not the best source for Shuttle costs.|date=April 2016}}  Early studies from 1980 and 1982 proposed [[low-Earth orbit|in-space]] uses for the tank to be re-used in space for various applications<ref name=nasaStudy1982>[http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19940004970_1994004970.pdf NASA-CR-195281, \"Utilization of the external tanks of the space transportation system\"] {{dead link|date=January 2015}}</ref><ref name=nasaStudy1980>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/stsation.htm|title=STS External Tank Station|publisher=Ntrs.nasa.gov|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref> but NASA never pursued those options beyond the proposal stage.\n\nDuring the 1970s further VTVL and HTHL SSTO designs were proposed for [[solar power satellite]] and military applications. There was a VTVL SSTO [http://www.abo.fi/~mlindroo/SpaceLVs/Slides/sld043.htm study] by [[Boeing]]. HTHL SSTO designs included the [[Rockwell International|Rockwell]] [http://www.abo.fi/~mlindroo/SpaceLVs/Slides/sld047.htm Star-Raker] and the Boeing [http://www.abo.fi/~mlindroo/SpaceLVs/Slides/sld041.htm HTHL SSTO study]. However the focus of all space launch funding in the United States on the Shuttle killed off these prospects. The [[Soviet Union]] followed suit with [[Shuttle Buran|Buran]]. Others preferred expendables for their lower design risk, and lower design cost.\n\nEventually the Shuttle was found to be expensive to maintain, even more expensive than an expendable launch system would have been.\nThe cancellation of a Shuttle-[[Centaur rocket]] after the loss of [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]] also caused an hiatus that would make it necessary for the United States military to scramble back towards expendables to launch their payloads. Many commercial satellite customers had switched to expendables even before that, due to unresponsiveness to customer concerns by the Shuttle launch system.\n\nIn 1986 President [[Ronald Reagan]] called for an airbreathing [[scramjet]] plane to be built by the year 2000, called [[National Aerospace Plane|NASP]]/[[X-30]] that would be capable of SSTO. Based on the research project '''copper canyon''' the project failed due to severe technical issues and was cancelled in 1993.\n\nThis research may have inspired the British [[HOTOL]] program, which rather than airbreathing to high [[hypersonic]] speeds as with NASP, proposed to use a precooler up to Mach 5.5. The program's funding was canceled by the British government when the research identified some technical risks as well as indicating that that particular vehicle architecture would only be able to deliver a relatively small payload size to orbit.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed in the early nineties, the cost of [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] became untenable. [[Russia]] has only used pure expendables for space launch since.\n\nThe 1990s saw interest in developing new reusable vehicles. The military [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (\"Star Wars\") program \"Brilliant Pebbles\" required low cost, rapid turnaround space launch. From this requirement came the [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[Delta Clipper]] VTVL SSTO proposal. The [[DC-X]] prototype for Delta Clipper demonstrated rapid turnaround time and that automatic computer control of such a vehicle was possible. It also demonstrated it was possible to make a reusable space launch vehicle which did not require a large standing army to maintain like the Shuttle.\n\nIn mid-1990, further British research and major reengineering to avoid deficiencies of the HOTOL design led to the far more promising [[Skylon (spacecraft)|Skylon]] design, with much greater payload.\n\nFrom the commercial side, large [[satellite constellation]]s such as [[Iridium satellite constellation]] were proposed which also had low cost space access demands. This fueled a private launch industry, including partially reusable vehicle players, such as [[Rocketplane Kistler]], and reusable vehicle players such as [[Roton SSTO|Rotary Rocket]].\n\nThe end of that decade saw the implosion of the satellite constellation market with the bankruptcy of [[Iridium Satellite LLC|Iridium]]. In turn the nascent private launch industry collapsed. The fall of the Soviet Union eventually had political ripples which led to a scaling down of ballistic missile defense, including the demise of the \"Brilliant Pebbles\" program. The military decided to replace their aging expendable launcher workhorses, evolved from ballistic missile technology, with the [[Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle|EELV]] program. NASA proposed riskier reusable concepts to replace Shuttle, to be demonstrated under the [[X-33]] and [[X-34]] programs.\n\nThe 21st century saw rising costs and teething problems lead to the cancellation of both X-33 and X-34. Then the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]] and another grounding of the fleet. The Shuttle design was now over 20 years old and in need of replacement. Meanwhile, the military EELV program churned out a new generation of better expendables. The commercial satellite market is depressed due to a glut of cheap expendable rockets and there is a dearth of satellite payloads.\n\nAgainst this backdrop came the [[Ansari X Prize]] contest, inspired by the aviation contests made in the early 20th century. Many private companies competed for the Ansari X Prize, the winner being [[Scaled Composites]] with their reusable HTHL [[SpaceShipOne]]. It won the ten million dollars, by reaching 100 kilometers in altitude twice in a two-week period with the equivalent of three people on board, with no more than ten percent of the non-fuel weight of the spacecraft replaced between flights. While SpaceShipOne is [[suborbital]] like the X-15, some hope the private sector can eventually develop reusable orbital vehicles given enough incentive. [[SpaceX]] is a recent player in the private launch market succeeding in converting its [[Falcon 9]] [[Expendable launch system|expendable]] launch vehicle into a partially [[SpaceX reusable launch system development program|reusable vehicle]] by returning the [[First stage (rocketry)|first stage]] for reuse.\n\nOn 23 November 2015, [[Blue Origin New Shepard]] rocket became the first proven [[VTVL|Vertical Take-off Vertical Landing (VTVL)]] rocket which can reach space, by passing [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line]] (100 kilometres), reaching 329,839 feet (100.5 kilometers).<ref name=\"space20151124\"/> Previous VTVL record was in 1994, the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-X]] ascended to an altitude of about 3.1 kilometers before successfully landing.<ref name=\"arstechnica20151125\">{{cite web|last1=Berger|first1=Eric|title=Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk spar over gravity of Blue Origin rocket landing|url=http://arstechnica.com/science/2015/11/jeff-bezos-and-elon-musk-spar-over-gravity-of-blue-origin-rocket-landing/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Reusability concepts==\n\n===Single stage===\nThere are two approaches to [[Single-stage-to-orbit|Single stage to orbit]] or SSTO.  The [[rocket equation]] says that an SSTO vehicle needs a high [[mass ratio]].  Mass ratio is defined as the mass of the fully fueled vehicle divided by the mass of the vehicle when empty (zero fuel weight, ZFW).\n\nOne way to increase the mass ratio is to reduce the mass of the empty vehicle by using very lightweight structures and high efficiency engines.  This tends to push up maintenance costs as component reliability can be impaired, and makes reuse more expensive to achieve.  The margins are so small with this approach that there is uncertainty whether such a vehicle would be able to carry any payload into orbit.\n\n===Two or more stages to orbit===\n[[Two stage to orbit]] requires designing and building two independent vehicles and dealing with the interactions between them at launch. Usually the second stage in launch vehicle is 5-10 times smaller than the first stage, although in '''biamese''' and '''triamese'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/triamese.htm|title=Triamese|publisher=Astronautix.com|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref> approaches each vehicle is the same size.\n\nIn addition, the first stage needs to be returned to the launch site for it to be reused. This is usually proposed to be done by flying a compromise trajectory that keeps the first stage above or close to the launch site at all times, or by using small airbreathing engines to fly the vehicle back, or by recovering the first stage downrange and returning it some other way (often landing in the sea, and returning it by ship.) Most techniques involve some performance penalty; these can require the first stage to be several times larger for the same payload, although for recovery from downrange these penalties may be small.\n\nThe second stage is normally returned after flying one or more orbits and reentering.\n\n===Biamese & Triamese (Crossfeed){{Anchor|Bimese}}{{Anchor|Triamese}}===\n{{Main|MUSTARD}}\nTwo or three similar stages are stacked side by side, and burn in parallel. Using crossfeed, the fuel tanks of the orbital stage are kept full, while the tank(s) in the booster stage(s) are used to run engines in the booster stage(s) and orbital stage. Once the boosters run dry, they are ejected, and (typically) glide back to a landing. The advantage to this is that the mass ratios of the individual stages is vastly reduced due to the way cross feed modifies the rocket equation. Isp*g*ln(2MR^2/MR+1) & Isp*g*ln(3MR^2/MR+2){{clarify|date=September 2016}}<!-- MR? Isp? need clarification for the gloabal Wikipedia reader --> respectively.{{original research inline|date=September 2016}} With hydrogen engines, a triamese only needs an MR of 5, as opposed to an MR of 10 for a single-stage equivalent vehicle.{{cn|date=September 2016}}<!--  sources for use of biamese/triamese terms in this context? -->\n\nA criticism of this approach is that designing separate orbiter and boosters, or a single vehicle that could do both, would compromise performance, safety, and possible cost savings. Compromising maximum performance to reduce cargo cost however, is the point of the triamese approach. Stacking two or three winged vehicles can also be challenging. Optimistically, the lower mass ratios would translate to lower overall R&D costs, even if two different stage designs. While many aerospace designs have successfully been modified far beyond the original designers intentions (Boeing's 747 is perhaps the best example) the slow and painful birth of the F-35 family demonstrates that it is not always a guarantee of such flexibility.{{cn|date=September 2016}}\n\n===Horizontal landing===\n[[File:Kluft-photo-SS1-landing-June-2004-Img 1406c.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne]] used horizontal landing after being launched from a carrier airplane]]\nIn this case the vehicle requires wings and undercarriage (unless landing at sea). This typically requires about 9-12% of the landing vehicle to be wings; which in turn implies that the takeoff weight is higher and/or the payload smaller.\n\nConcepts such as [[lifting body|lifting bodies]] attempt to deal with the somewhat conflicting issues of reentry, hypersonic and subsonic flight; as does the [[delta wing]] shape of the [[Space shuttle|Space Shuttle]].\n\n===Vertical landing===\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas DC-XA.jpg|thumb|right|[[McDonnell Douglas DC-X]] used vertical takeoff and vertical landing]]\n\nParachutes could be used to land vertically, either at sea, or with the use of small landing rockets, on land (as with Soyuz). McDonnell Douglas DC-X ascended to an altitude of about 3.1 kilometers before successfully landing.<ref name=\"arstechnica20151125\"/>\n\nAlternatively rockets could be used to softland the vehicle on the ground from the subsonic speeds reached at low altitude (see [[DC-X]]). This typically requires about 10% of the landing weight of the vehicle to be propellant.\n\nA slightly different approach to vertical landing is to use an [[autogyro]] or [[helicopter]] rotor. This requires perhaps 2-3% of the landing weight for the rotor.\n\n[[SpaceX]]'s grasshopper rocket, a 10-story Vertical Takeoff Vertical Landing (VTVL) vehicle, became the first reusable rocket designed to test the technologies needed to return a rocket back to Earth intact. While most rockets are designed to burn up in the atmosphere during reentry, SpaceX's rockets are being designed to return to the launch pad for a vertical landing.\n\n[[Blue Origin New Shepard]] rocket became the first proven rocket which can do vertical landing after reaching space,{{clarify|date=January 2016}} by passing [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line]] (100 kilometres).<ref name=\"space20151124\"/>\n\n[[SpaceX]]'s [[Falcon 9]] rocket became the first orbital rocket to vertically land its first stage on the ground, after propelling its second stage and payload to a suborbital trajectory, where it would continue on to orbit.<<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/679114269485436928|title=SpaceX on Twitter|author=|date=|work=Twitter|accessdate=January 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Horizontal takeoff===\n[[File:Xcor-ezrocket-N132EZ-020627-02.jpg|thumb|right|[[XCOR EZ-Rocket|XCOR Aerospace EZ-Rocket]] used horizontal takeoff and landing using a standard airport runway]]\nThe vehicle needs wings to take off. For reaching orbit, a 'wet wing' would often need to be used where the wing contains propellant. Around 9-12% of the vehicle takeoff weight is perhaps tied up in the wings.\n\n===Vertical takeoff===\n{{see also|VTVL}}\n\nThis is the traditional takeoff regime for pure rocket vehicles. Rockets are good for this regime, since they have a very high thrust/weight ratio (~100).\n\n===Airbreathing===\nAirbreathing approaches use the air during ascent for propulsion. The most commonly proposed approach is the [[scramjet]], but [[turborocket]], [[Liquid air cycle engine|Liquid Air Cycle Engine]] (LACE) and [[precooled jet engine]]s have also been proposed.\n\nIn all cases the highest speed that an airbreathing engine can reach is far short of orbital speed (about Mach 15 for Scramjets and Mach 5-6 for the other engine designs), and rockets would be used for the remaining 10-20 Mach into orbit.\n\nThe thermal situation for airbreathers (particularly scramjets) can be awkward; normal rockets fly steep initial trajectories to avoid drag, whereas scramjets would deliberately fly through relatively thick atmosphere at high speed generating enormous heating of the airframe. The thermal situation for the other airbreathing approaches is much more benign, although is not without its challenges.\n\n===Propellant===\n\n====Hydrogen fuel====\nHydrogen is often proposed since it has the highest exhaust velocity. However tankage and pump weights are high due to insulation and low propellant density; and this wipes out much of the advantage.\n\nStill, the 'wet mass' of a hydrogen fuelled stage is lighter than an equivalent dense stage with the same payload and this can permit usage of wings, and is good for second stages.\n\n====Dense fuel====\nDense fuel is sometimes proposed since, although it implies a heavier vehicle, the specific tankage and pump mass is much improved over hydrogen. Dense fuel is usually suggested for vertical takeoff vehicles, and is compatible with horizontal landing vehicles, since the vehicle is lighter than an equivalent hydrogen vehicle when empty of propellant.\nNon-cryogenic dense fuels also permit the storage of fuel in wing structures.\nProjects have been underway to densify existing fuel types through various techniques. These include slush technologies for cryogenics like hydrogen and propane. Another densifying method has been studied that would also increase the specific impulse of fuels. Adding finely powdered carbon, aluminum, titanium, and boron to hydrogen and kerosene have been studied. These additives increase the specific impulse (Isp) but also the density of the fuel. For instance, the French ONERA missile program tested boron with kerosene in gelled slurries, as well as embedded in paraffin, and demonstrated increases in volumetric specific impulse of between 20-100%.\n\n====Tripropellant====\nDense fuel is optimal early on in a flight, since the thrust to weight of the engines is better due to higher density; this means the vehicle accelerates more quickly and reaches orbit sooner, reducing [[gravity drag|gravity losses]].\n\nHowever, for reaching orbital speed, hydrogen is a better fuel, since the high exhaust velocity and hence lower propellant mass reduces the take off weight.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nTherefore, tripropellant vehicles{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} start off burning with dense fuel and transition to hydrogen. (In a sense the [[Space Shuttle]] does this with its combination of solid rockets and main engines, but tripropellant vehicles usually carry their engines to orbit.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}})\n\n====Propellant costs====\nAs with all current launch vehicles, propellant costs for a rocket are much lower than the costs of the hardware. However, for reusable vehicles if the vehicles are successful, then the hardware is reused many times and this would bring the costs of the hardware down. In addition, reusable vehicles are frequently heavier and hence less propellant efficient, so the propellant costs could start to multiply up to the point where they become significant.\n\n===Launch assistance/non rocket space launch===\n{{main|Non-rocket spacelaunch}}\nSince rocket [[delta-v]] has a non linear relationship to [[Propellant mass fraction|mass fraction]] due to the [[rocket equation]], any small reduction in delta-v gives a relatively large reduction in the required mass fraction; and starting a mission at higher altitude also helps.\n\nMany systems have proposed the use of aircraft to gain some initial velocity and altitude; either by towing, carrying or even simply refueling a vehicle at altitude.\n\nVarious other launch assists have been proposed, such as [[Rocket sled launch|ground-based sleds]], or [[Maglev (transport)|maglev]] systems, high-altitude (80&nbsp;km) maglev systems such as [[launch loop]]s, to more exotic systems such as [[tether propulsion]] systems to catch the vehicle at high altitude, or even [[Space Elevator]]s.\n\n===Reentry heat shields===\n{{main|Atmospheric entry}}\n[[Robert Zubrin]] has said that as a rough rule of thumb, 15% of the landed weight of a vehicle needs to be aerobraking reentry shielding.<ref name=\"atom\">{{cite web |url=http://www.projectrho.com/rocket/basicdesign.php |title=Basic Design |first=Winchell D.

Given the need for such warheads to reenter the atmosphere swiftly and retain hypersonic velocities to sea level, researchers developed what are known as SHARP materials, typically [[hafnium diboride]] and [[zirconium diboride]], whose thermal tolerance exceeds 3600 C. SHARP equipped vehicles can fly at Mach 11 at 30&nbsp;km altitude and Mach 7 at sea level. The sharp-edged geometries permitted with these materials also eliminates plasma shock wave interference in radio communications during reentry. SHARP materials are very robust and would not require constant maintenance, as is the case with technologies like silica tiles, used on the Space Shuttle, which account for over half of that vehicles maintenance costs and turnaround time. The maintenance savings alone are thus a major factor in favor of using these materials for a reusable launch vehicle, whose raison d'etre is high flight rates for economical launch costs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n===Weight penalty===\nThe weight of a reusable vehicle is almost invariably higher than an expendable that was made with the same materials, for a given payload.\n\n===R&D===\nThe [[research & development]] costs of reusable vehicle are expected to be higher, because making a vehicle reusable implies making it robust enough to survive more than one use, which adds to the testing required. Increasing robustness is most easily done by adding weight; but this reduces performance and puts further pressure on the R&D to recoup this in some other way.\n\nThese extra costs must be recouped; and this pushes up the average cost of the vehicle.\n\n===Maintenance===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nReusable launch systems require maintenance, which is often substantial. The Space Shuttle system required extensive refurbishing between flights, primarily dealing with the silica tile TPS and the high performance LH2/LOX burning main engines. Both systems require a significant amount of detailed inspection, rebuilding and parts replacement between flights, and account for over 75% of the maintenance costs of the Shuttle system. These costs, far in excess of what had been anticipated when the system was constructed, have cut the maximum flight rate of Shuttle to 1/4 of that planned. This has also quadrupled the cost per pound of payload to orbit, making Shuttle economically infeasible in today's launch market for any but the largest payloads, for which there is no competition.\n\nFor any RLV technology to be successful, it must learn from the failings of Shuttle and overcome those failings with new technologies in the TPS and propulsion areas.\n\n===Manpower and logistics===\nThe Space Shuttle program required a standing army of over 9,000 employees to maintain, refurbish, and relaunch the shuttle fleet, irrespective of flight rates. That manpower budget must be divided by the total number of flights per year. The fewer flights means the cost per flight goes up significantly. Streamlining the manpower requirements of any launch system is an essential part of making an RLV economical. Projects that have attempted to develop this ethic include the DC-X Delta Clipper project, as well as SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon 1 programs.\n\nOne issue mitigating against this drive for labor savings is government regulation. Given that NASA and USAF (as well as government programs in other countries) are the primary customers and sources of development capital, government regulatory requirements for oversight, parwork, quality, safety, and other documentation tend to inflate the operational costs of any such system.\n\n==Orbital reusable launchers==\n\n===Under development===\n*[[RLV-TD]], ([[India]]): On 23 May 2016, [[ISRO]] successfully performed [[test flight]] of India\u2019s first reusable launch vehicle that operates at [[hypersonic speed]].<ref name=\"India\u2019s Reusable Launch Vehicle Successfully Flight Tested\">{{cite news|title=India\u2019s Reusable Launch Vehicle Successfully Flight Tested|publisher=[[ISRO]] website|accessdate=23 May 2016|url=http://www.isro.gov.in/update/23-may-2016/india%E2%80%99s-reusable-launch-vehicle-technology-demonstrator-rlv-td-successfully}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://idrw.org/indias-futuristic-unmanned-space-shuttle-getting-final-touches/ |title=India\u2019s Futuristic Unmanned Space Shuttle Getting Final Touches |work=EXPRESS NEWS SERVICE |publisher=Indian Defence Research Wing |date=20 May 2015 |accessdate=2015-08-02 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aame.in/2011/08/india-space-shuttle-reusable-launch.html |title=Wednesday, August 03, 2011India's Space Shuttle [Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV)] program |work=AA Me, IN |date=2011 |accessdate=2015-08-02 }}</ref>\n* [[Adeline (rocket)|Adeline]] - Reusable launch system concept developed by [[Airbus Defence and Space]]\n* [[Blue Origin]] is developing a reusable booster system, {{asof|2015|11|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/552848main_Commercial_Crew_Program_Overview_Collura.pdf|title=Commercial Crew Program Overview|date=2011-04-22|publisher=NASA|accessdate=21 November 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"arstechnica20151125\"/> [[Blue Origin New Shepard]] rocket is the first rocket successfully launched and which is proven to be able to land vertically on earth [[VTVL]] after reaching space, by passing [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line]].<ref name=\"space20151124\">{{cite news| url=http://www.space.com/31202-blue-origin-historic-private-rocket-landing.html |title=Blue Origin Makes Historic Reusable Rocket Landing in Epic Test Flight |work=Calla Cofield |publisher=Space.Com |date=2015-11-24 |accessdate=2015-11-25 }}</ref>\n* {{asof|2014}}, China is working on a project to recover rocket boosters, using a \"[[paraglider|paraglider-type wings]]\" approach.
