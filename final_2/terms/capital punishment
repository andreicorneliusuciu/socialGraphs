The [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] that someone be punished in such a manner is referred to as a '''death sentence''', whereas the act of carrying out the sentence is known as an '''execution'''. Crimes that can result in a death penalty are known as '''capital crimes''' or '''capital offences'''. The term ''capital'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''capitalis'' (\"of the head\", referring to execution by beheading).<ref name=KronenwetterP202>{{Harvnb|Kronenwetter|2001|p=202}}</ref>\n\nFifty-eight countries retain capital punishment, 102 countries have completely abolished it ''[[de jure]]'' for all crimes, six have abolished it for ordinary crimes (while maintaining it for special circumstances such as war crimes), and 32 are abolitionist in practice.<ref name=\"amnesty2015\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/3487/2016/en/ |title=DEATH SENTENCES AND EXECUTIONS REPORT 2015 |publisher=Amnesty International|access-date=10 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nCapital punishment is a matter of active controversy in various countries and states, and positions can vary within a single [[political ideology]] or cultural region.

In most countries that practise capital punishment it is reserved for [[murder]], [[espionage]], [[treason]], or as part of military justice. In some countries sexual crimes, such as [[rape]], [[adultery]], [[incest]] and [[sodomy]], carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as [[Apostasy from Islam|apostasy in Islamic nations]] (the formal renunciation of the [[state religion]]). In many [[Use of capital punishment by nation|countries that use the death penalty]], [[drug trafficking]] is also a capital offence. In China, [[Trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]] and serious cases of [[Political corruption|corruption]] are punished by the death penalty.

Most historical records and various primitive tribal practices indicate that the death penalty was a part of their justice system. Communal punishment for wrongdoing generally included compensation by the wrongdoer, [[corporal punishment]], [[shunning]], [[exile|banishment]] and execution. Usually, compensation and shunning were enough as a form of justice.<ref>So common was the practice of compensation that the word ''murder'' is derived from the French word ''mordre'' (bite) a reference to the heavy compensation one must pay for causing an unjust death. The \"bite\" one had to pay was used as a term for the crime itself: \"Mordre wol out; that se we day by day.\" \u2013 [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (1340\u20131400), [[The Canterbury Tales]], ''The Nun's Priest's Tale,'' l. 4242 (1387\u20131400), repr. In ''The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer'', ed. Alfred W. Pollard, et al. (1898).</ref> The response to crime committed by neighbouring tribes or communities included a formal apology, compensation or blood [[feud]]s.\n\nA [[Feud|blood feud]] or vendetta occurs when arbitration between families or tribes fails or an arbitration system is non-existent. This form of justice was common before the emergence of an arbitration system based on state or organized religion. It may result from crime, land disputes or a code of honour. \"Acts of retaliation underscore the ability of the social collective to defend itself and demonstrate to enemies (as well as potential allies) that injury to property, rights, or the person will not go unpunished.\"<ref>Translated from Waldmann, ''op.cit.'', p. 147.</ref> However, in practice, it is often difficult to distinguish between a war of vendetta and one of conquest.\n\nSevere historical penalties include [[breaking wheel]], [[boiling to death]], [[flaying]], [[slow slicing]], [[disembowelment]], [[crucifixion]], [[impalement]], [[Crushing (execution)|crushing]] (including [[crushing by elephant]]), [[stoning]], [[execution by burning]], [[dismemberment]], [[sawing (torture)|sawing]], [[decapitation]], [[scaphism]], [[necklacing]] or [[blowing from a gun]].\n\n===Ancient history===\n[[File:Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me - The Christian Martyrs' Last Prayer - Walters 37113.jpg|thumb|left|''The Christian Martyrs' Last Prayer'', by [[Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me]] (1883). [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Colosseum]].]]\nElaborations of tribal arbitration of [[feud]]s included peace settlements often done in a religious context and compensation system. Compensation was based on the principle of ''substitution'' which might include material (for example, cattle, slave) compensation, exchange of brides or grooms, or payment of the blood debt. Settlement rules could allow for animal blood to replace human blood, or transfers of property or [[Blood money (term)|blood money]] or in some case an offer of a person for execution. The person offered for execution did not have to be an original perpetrator of the crime because the system was based on tribes, not individuals. Blood feuds could be regulated at meetings, such as the [[Norsemen]] ''[[Thing (assembly)|things]]''.<ref>Lindow, ''op.cit.'' (primarily discusses Icelandic ''things'').</ref> Systems deriving from blood feuds may survive alongside more advanced legal systems or be given recognition by courts (for example, [[trial by combat]]). One of the more modern refinements of the blood feud is the [[duel]].\n\nIn certain parts of the world, nations in the form of ancient republics, monarchies or tribal oligarchies emerged. These nations were often united by common linguistic, religious or family ties. Moreover, expansion of these nations often occurred by conquest of neighbouring tribes or nations. Consequently, various classes of royalty, nobility, various commoners and slave emerged. Accordingly, the systems of tribal arbitration were submerged into a more unified system of justice which formalized the relation between the different \"classes\" rather than \"tribes\". The earliest and most famous example is [[Code of Hammurabi]] which set the different punishment and compensation, according to the different class/group of victims and perpetrators. The [[Torah]] (Jewish Law), also known as the [[Pentateuch]] (the first five books of the Christian [[Old Testament]]), lays down the death penalty for murder, [[kidnapping]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], violation of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], [[blasphemy]], and a wide range of sexual crimes, although evidence suggests that actual executions were rare.<ref>{{Cite book|first=William|last=Schabas|year=2002|title=The Abolition of the Death Penalty in International Law|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-81491-X}}</ref>\n\nA further example comes from [[Ancient Greece]], where the [[Athenian]] legal system was first written down by [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]] in about 621 BC: the death penalty was applied for a particularly wide range of crimes, though [[Solon]] later repealed Draco's code and published new laws, retaining only Draco's homicide statutes.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert|url=http://history-world.org/draco_and_solon_laws.htm|title=Greece, A History of Ancient Greece, Draco and Solon Laws|publisher=History-world.org|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> The word [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] derives from Draco's laws.

When abolishing the death penalty Xuanzong ordered his officials to refer to the nearest regulation by analogy when sentencing those found guilty of crimes for which the prescribed punishment was execution. Thus depending on the severity of the crime a punishment of severe scourging with the thick rod or of exile to the remote Lingnan region might take the place of capital punishment. However, the death penalty was restored only 12 years later in 759 in response to the [[An Lushan Rebellion]].<ref>Benn, pp. 209\u2013210</ref> At this time in the Tang dynasty only the emperor had the authority to sentence criminals to execution. Under [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Xuanzong]] capital punishment was relatively infrequent, with only 24 executions in the year 730 and 58 executions in the year 736.<ref name=\"benn 8\"/>\n\nThe two most common forms of execution in the Tang dynasty were strangulation and decapitation, which were the prescribed methods of execution for 144 and 89 offences respectively. Strangulation was the prescribed sentence for lodging an accusation against one's parents or grandparents with a magistrate, scheming to kidnap a person and sell them into slavery and opening a coffin while desecrating a tomb. Decapitation was the method of execution prescribed for more serious crimes such as treason and sedition. Despite the great discomfort involved, most of the Tang Chinese preferred strangulation to decapitation, as a result of the traditional Tang Chinese belief that the body is a gift from the parents and that it is, therefore, disrespectful to one's ancestors to die without returning one's body to the grave intact.\n\nSome further forms of capital punishment were practised in the Tang dynasty, of which the first two that follow at least were extralegal.{{Clarify|if they were extra-legal, they fail the definition of CapPun|date=July 2016}} The first of these was scourging to death with the thick rod{{Clarify|what is scourging with a thick rod? Anal?|date=July 2016}} which was common throughout the Tang dynasty especially in cases of gross corruption. The second was truncation, in which the convicted person was cut in two at the waist with a fodder knife and then left to bleed to death.<ref name=Benn210>Benn, p. 210</ref> A further form of execution called Ling Chi ([[slow slicing]]), or death by/of a thousand cuts, was used from the close of the Tang dynasty (around 900) to its abolition in 1905.\n\nWhen a minister of the fifth grade or above received a death sentence the emperor might grant him a special dispensation allowing him to commit suicide in lieu of execution. Even when this privilege was not granted, the law required that the condemned minister be provided with food and ale by his keepers and transported to the execution ground in a cart rather than having to walk there.\n\nNearly all executions under the Tang dynasty took place in public as a warning to the population. The heads of the executed were displayed on poles or spears. When local authorities decapitated a convicted criminal, the head was boxed and sent to the capital as proof of identity and that the execution had taken place.<ref name=Benn210 />\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Rohrbach-verbrennung-1525.jpg|thumb|upright|The burning of Jakob Rohrbach, a leader of the peasants during the [[German Peasants' War]].]]\n[[File:Lamanie kolem L 001xx.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[breaking wheel]] was used during the Middle Ages and was still in use into the 19th century.]]\n\nIn [[Middle Age|medieval]] and early modern Europe, before the development of modern [[prison]] systems, the death penalty was also used as a generalized form of punishment. During the reign of [[Henry VIII of England]], as many as 72,000 people are estimated to have been executed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/execution/readings/history.html|title=History of the Death Penalty|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service|accessdate=12 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring early modern Europe, a massive [[moral panic]] regarding [[witchcraft]] swept across Europe and later the European colonies in North America. During this period, there were widespread claims that malevolent [[Satanism|Satanic]] [[witchcraft|witches]] were operating as an organized threat to [[Christendom]]. As a result, tens of thousands of women were prosecuted and executed through the [[witch trials in the early modern period|witch trials of the early modern period]] (between the 15th and 18th centuries).\n\nThe death penalty also targeted sexual offences such as [[sodomy]]. In England, the [[Buggery Act 1533]] stipulated hanging as punishment for \"[[buggery]]\". [[James Pratt and John Smith]] were the last two Englishmen to be executed for sodomy in 1835.<ref>{{cite book | title=A Gay History of Britain: Love and Sex Between Men Since the Middle Ages | publisher=Greenwood World Publishing | last1=Cook |first1=Matt | last2=Mills |first2=Robert | last3=Trumback |first3=Randolph | last4=Cocks |first4=Harry | year=2007 |page=109| isbn=1846450020}}</ref>\n\nDespite the wide use of the death penalty, calls for reform were not unknown. The 12th century [[Jewish]] legal scholar, Moses [[Maimonides]], wrote, \"It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent man to death.\" He argued that executing an accused criminal on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing [[Legal burden of proof|burdens of proof]], until we would be convicting merely \"according to the judge's caprice\". Maimonides's concern was maintaining popular respect for law, and he saw errors of commission as much more threatening than errors of omission.<ref>Moses Maimonides, ''The Commandments, Neg.

A large part of execution was the summary execution of enemy combatants. In Nazi Germany there were three types of capital punishment; hanging, decapitation and death by shooting.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gN0QgcW4Td0C&pg=PA289&lpg=PA289&dq=Nazi+germany+law+decapitation&source=bl&ots=s76s2yKF0T&sig=VRp78E6M4IEwAIekYeVTWsvnHoY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5ThoUpHKEYTCywG7koBg&ved=0CHkQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q=Nazi%20germany%20law%20decapitation&f=false|page= 289|title=The criminal law of Japan: the general part|author=Dando Shigemitsu|year=1999}}</ref> Also, modern military organisations employed capital punishment as a means of maintaining military discipline.

One method of execution, since firearms came into common use, has also been [[firing squad]], although some countries use execution with a single shot to the head or neck.\n\nVarious authoritarian states\u2014for example those with fascist or Communist governments\u2014employed the death penalty as a potent means of political oppression. According to [[Robert Conquest]], the leading expert on Stalin's purges, more than 1 million Soviet citizens were executed during [[the Great Terror]] of 1937\u201338, almost all by a bullet to the back of the head.<ref>Conquest, Robert, ''[[The Great Terror]]: A Reassessment'', New York, pages 485\u201386</ref> [[Mao Zedong]] publicly stated that \"800,000\" people had been executed after the Communist Party's [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|victory]] in 1949. Partly as a response to such excesses, civil rights organizations have started to place increasing emphasis on the concept of [[human rights]] and an abolition of the death penalty.\n\nAmong countries around the world, almost all European and many Pacific Area states (including Australia, New Zealand and [[East Timor|Timor Leste]]), and Canada have abolished capital punishment. In Latin America, most states have completely abolished the use of capital punishment while some countries, such as Brazil, allow for capital punishment only in exceptional situations, such as treason committed during wartime. The [[Capital punishment in the United States|United States]] (the federal government and 31 of the states), Guatemala, most of the Caribbean and the majority of democracies in Asia (for example, Japan and India) and Africa (for example, Botswana and Zambia) retain it.

The United States is a notable exception: some states have had bans on capital punishment for decades, the earliest is [[Michigan]], where it was abolished in 1846, while others actively use it today. The death penalty there remains a contentious issue which is hotly debated.\n\nIn abolitionist countries, the debate is sometimes revived by particularly brutal murders though few countries have brought it back after abolishing it. However, a spike in serious, violent crimes, such as murders or terrorist attacks, has prompted some countries (such as Sri Lanka and Jamaica) to effectively end the moratorium on the death penalty. In retention countries, the debate is sometimes revived when a miscarriage of justice has occurred though this tends to cause legislative efforts to improve the judicial process rather than to abolish the death penalty.\n\n==Modern-day public opinion==\nThe public opinion on the death penalty varies considerably by country and by the crime in question.

[[Hanging]] by turning the victim off a ladder or by kicking a stool or a bucket, which causes death by suffocation, was replaced by [[hanging|long drop \"hanging\"]] where the subject is dropped a longer distance to [[Cervical dislocation|dislocate the neck]] and sever the [[spinal cord]].

Since [[World War II]] there has been a trend toward abolishing capital punishment. Capital punishment has been completely abolished by 102 countries, a further six have done so for all offences except under special circumstances and 32 more have abolished it in practice because they have not used it for at least 10 years and are believed to have a policy or established practice against carrying out executions.<ref name=\"amnesty2015\"/>\n\nThe death penalty was banned in China between 747 and 759. In Japan, [[Emperor Saga]] abolished the death penalty in 818 under the influence of Shinto and it lasted until 1156.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1472|title=Encyclopedia of Shinto|publisher=kokugakuin.ac.jp|accessdate=5 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn England, a public statement of opposition was included in [[The Twelve Conclusions of the Lollards]], written in 1395. Sir Thomas More's ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', published in 1516, debated the benefits of the death penalty in dialogue form, coming to no firm conclusion. More recent opposition to the death penalty stemmed from the book of the Italian [[Cesare Beccaria]] ''Dei Delitti e Delle Pene'' (\"[[On Crimes and Punishments]]\"), published in 1764. In this book, Beccaria aimed to demonstrate not only the injustice, but even the futility from the point of view of [[social policy|social welfare]], of [[torture]] and the death penalty. Influenced by the book, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Grand Duke Leopold II]] of Habsburg, famous [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightened monarch]] and future Emperor of Austria, abolished the death penalty in the then-independent [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], the first permanent abolition in modern times. On 30 November 1786, after having ''de facto'' blocked capital executions (the last was in 1769), Leopold promulgated the reform of the [[penal code]] that abolished the death penalty and ordered the destruction of all the instruments for capital execution in his land. In 2000, Tuscany's regional authorities instituted an annual holiday on 30 November to commemorate the event. The event is commemorated on this day by 300 cities around the world celebrating [[Cities for Life Day]].\n\nThe [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] banned capital punishment in 1849. [[Venezuela]] followed suit and abolished the death penalty in 1854<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/venezuela/5.htm|title=Venezuela: A Country Study (The Century of Caudillismo)|publisher=countrystudies.us|accessdate=4 August 2012}}</ref> and [[Use of capital punishment by nation|San Marino]] did so in 1865. The last execution in San Marino had taken place in 1468. In Portugal, after legislative proposals in 1852 and 1863, the death penalty was abolished in 1867.\n\nAbolition occurred in [[Capital punishment in Canada#History|Canada in 1976 (except for some military offences, with complete abolition in 1998)]], in [[Capital punishment in France#Abolition|France in 1981]], and in [[Capital punishment in Australia#Commonwealth|Australia in 1973]] (although the state of [[Capital punishment in Australia#Western Australia|Western Australia]] retained the penalty until 1984). In 1977, the United Nations General Assembly affirmed in a formal resolution that throughout the world, it is desirable to \"progressively restrict the number of offences for which the death penalty might be imposed, with a view to the desirability of abolishing this punishment\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsbatch.com/deathpenalty.htm|title=Death Penalty|publisher=Newsbatch.com|date=1 March 2005|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, it was abolished for murder (leaving only [[treason]], [[piracy with violence]], [[arson in royal dockyards]] and a number of wartime military offences as capital crimes) for a five-year experiment in 1965 and permanently in 1969, the last execution having taken place in 1964.

Georgia]]'' case, but the 1976 ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'' case once again permitted the death penalty under certain circumstances. Further limitations were placed on the death penalty in ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]'' (death penalty unconstitutional for people with an [[intellectual disability]]) and ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'' (death penalty unconstitutional if defendant was under age 18 at the time the crime was committed). In the United States, 18 states and the [[District of Columbia]] ban capital punishment.\n\nAbolitionists believe capital punishment is the worst violation of [[human rights]], because the [[right to life]] is the most important, and capital punishment violates it without necessity and inflicts to the condemned a [[psychological torture]]. Human rights activists oppose the death penalty, calling it \"cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment\".

The first of the [[Five Precepts]] (Panca-sila) is to abstain from destruction of life. Chapter 10 of the [[Dhammapada]] states:\n\n<blockquote>Everyone fears punishment; everyone fears death, just as you do. Therefore you do not kill or cause to be killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.2.14.irel.html|title=Dhammika Sutta: Dhammika|publisher=Accesstoinsight.org|date=11 July 2010|accessdate=30 April 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nChapter 26, the final chapter of the Dhammapada, states, \"Him I call a [[brahmin]] who has put aside weapons and renounced violence toward all creatures. He neither kills nor helps others to kill.\" These sentences are interpreted by many Buddhists (especially in the West) as an injunction against supporting any legal measure which might lead to the death penalty. However, as is often the case with the interpretation of scripture, there is dispute on this matter. Historically, most states where the official religion is [[Buddhism]] have imposed capital punishment for some offences. One notable exception is the abolition of the death penalty by the [[Emperor Saga]] of Japan in 818. This lasted until 1165, although in private manors executions continued to be conducted as a form of retaliation. [[Japan]] still imposes the death penalty, although some recent justice ministers have refused to sign death warrants, citing their [[Buddhist]] beliefs as their reason.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7694483.stm|title=Japan hangs two more on death row (see also paragraph 11)|publisher=BBC News|date=28 October 2008|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> Other Buddhist-majority states vary in their policy. For example, [[Bhutan]] has abolished the death penalty, but [[Thailand]] still retains it, although [[Buddhism]] is the official religion in both. [[Mongolia]] abolished the death penalty in 2012.\n\nMany stories in Buddhist scripture stress the superior power of the Buddha's teaching to [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitate]] murderers and other criminals. The most well-known example is [[Angulimala]] in the [[Theravada]]n [[Pali canon]] who had killed 999 people and then attempted to kill his own mother and the Buddha, but under the influence of the Buddha he repented and entered the monkhood. The Buddha succeeded when the King and all his soldiers failed to eliminate the murderer by force.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thai Buddhist perspective on the death penalty|url=http://deathpenaltythailand.blogspot.com/2008/07/thai-buddhist-perspective-on-death.html|work=Seminar of Monks at Mahachulalongkorn Buddhist University, Chiangmai|publisher=Death Penalty Thailand}}</ref>\n\nWithout one official teaching on the death penalty, Thai monks are typically divided on the issue, with some favoring abolition of the death penalty while others see it as bad karma stemming from bad actions in the past.\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Second Seminar on Buddhist Perspectives on Death Penalty|url=http://deathpenaltythailand.blogspot.com/2008/07/second-seminar-on-buddhist-perspectives.html|work=seminar of monks at Wat Mahasawatnakphutaram in Ubon Ratchathani|publisher=Death Penalty in Thailand|accessdate=16 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts]] of the great Buddhist king [[Ashoka]] (ca. 304\u2013232 BC) inscribed on great [[Pillars of Ashoka|pillars]] around his kingdom, the King showed [[Reverence for Life|reverence for all life]] by giving up the slaughtering of animals, and many of his subjects followed his example. King Ashoka also extended the period before execution of those condemned to death so they could make a final appeal for their lives.\n\nA close reading of texts in the [[Pali canon]] reveals different attitudes towards violence and capital punishment. The [[Pali]] scholar [http://salc.uchicago.edu/faculty/collins Steven Collins] finds [[Dhamma]] in the Pali canon divided into two categories according to the attitude taken towards violence. In Mode 1 Dhamma the use of violence is \"context-dependent and negotiable\". A King should not pass judgement in haste or anger, but the punishment should fit the crime, with warfare and capital punishment acceptable in certain situations. In Mode 2 Dhamma the use of violence is \"context-independent and non-negotiable\" and the only advice to kings is to abdicate, renounce the world and leave everything to the law of karma. Buddhism is incompatible with any form of violence especially warfare and capital punishment.\n<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Steven|title=Nirvana and other Buddhist Felicities: Utopias of the Pali imaginaire|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=419\u2013420|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Nirvana_and_Other_Buddhist_Felicities.html?id=Z2go_y5KYyoC&redir_esc=y}}</ref>\n\nIn the world that humans inhabit there is a continual tension between these two modes of Dhamma. This tension is best exhibited in the [http://www.basicbuddhism.org/index.cfm?GPID=29 Cakkavatti Sihanada Sutta] (Digha Nikaya 26 of the Sutta Pitaka of the P\u0101li Canon), the story of humanity's decline from a golden age in the past. A critical turning point comes when the King decides not to give money to a man who has committed theft, but instead to cut off his head and also to carry out this punishment in a particularly cruel and humiliating manner, parading him in public to the sound of drums as he is taken to the execution ground outside the city.

(See [[Thought of Thomas Aquinas#Death penalty|Aquinas on the death penalty]].) In 1566, the [[Roman Catechism]] stated this teaching thus:\n\n<blockquote>Another kind of lawful slaying belongs to the civil authorities, to whom is entrusted power of life and death, by the legal and judicious exercise of which they punish the guilty and protect the innocent. The just use of this power, far from involving the crime of murder, is an act of paramount obedience to this Commandment which prohibits murder. The end of the Commandment is the preservation and security of human life. Now the punishments inflicted by the civil authority, which is the legitimate avenger of crime, naturally tend to this end, since they give security to life by repressing outrage and violence. Hence these words of David: ''In the morning I put to death all the wicked of the land, that I might cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the Lord''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cin.org/users/james/ebooks/master/trent/tcomm05.htm|title=THE CATECHISM OF TRENT: The Fifth Commandment|publisher=Cin.org|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe 1911 edition of the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] suggested that Catholics should hold that \"the infliction of capital punishment is not contrary to the teaching of the Catholic Church, and the power of the State to visit upon culprits the penalty of death derives much authority from revelation and from the writings of theologians\", but that the matter of \"the advisability of exercising that power is, of course, an affair to be determined upon other and various considerations.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12565a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Capital Punishment (Death Penalty)|publisher=Newadvent.org|date=1 June 1911|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, however, in the 1995 [[Evangelium Vitae]], [[Pope John Paul II]] suggested that capital punishment should be avoided unless it is the only way to defend society from the offender in question, opining that punishment \"ought not go to the extreme of executing the offender except in cases of absolute necessity: in other words, when it would not be possible otherwise to defend society.

If, however, non-lethal means are sufficient to defend and protect people's safety from the aggressor, authority will limit itself to such means, as these are more in keeping with the concrete conditions of the common good and more in conformity to the dignity of the human person.<ref name=\"desmond\"/></blockquote>\n\nThat the assessment of the contemporary situation advanced by John Paul II is not binding on the Catholic faithful was confirmed by [[Pope Benedict XVI|Cardinal Ratzinger]] when he wrote in 2004 that,\n\n<blockquote>if a Catholic were to be at odds with the [[Pope|Holy Father]] on the application of capital punishment or on the decision to wage war, he would not for that reason be considered unworthy to present himself to receive Holy Communion. While the Church exhorts civil authorities to seek peace, not war, and to exercise discretion and mercy in imposing punishment on criminals, it may still be permissible to take up arms to repel an aggressor or to have recourse to capital punishment. There may be a legitimate diversity of opinion even among Catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty, but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.priestsforlife.org/magisterium/bishops/04-07ratzingerommunion.htm|title=Abortion \u2013 Pro Life \u2013 Cardinal Ratzinger on Voting, Abortion, and Worthiness to Receive Holy Communion|publisher=Priestsforlife.org|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2015, [[Pope Francis]] stated in an address to the [[International Commission Against the Death Penalty|International Commission against the Death Penalty]] that: \"Today the death penalty is inadmissible, no matter how serious the crime committed.\" Francis argued that the death penalty is no longer justified by a society's need to defend itself and has lost all legitimacy due to the possibility of [[Wrongful execution|judicial error]]. He further stated that capital punishment is an offense \"against the inviolability of life and the dignity of the human person, which contradicts God's plan for man and society\" and \"does not render justice to the victims, but rather fosters vengeance.\" <ref name=\"gibson\">{{cite web|last1=Gibson|first1=David|title=Pope Francis takes a dim view of the death penalty, but not all Catholics are convinced|url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/politics/pope-francis-takes-dim-view-death-penalty-not-all-catholics-are-convinced|website=National Catholic Register|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref> In the address, Francis further explained:\n\n<blockquote> In certain circumstances, when hostilities are underway, a measured reaction is necessary in order to prevent the aggressor from causing harm, and the need to neutralize the aggressor may result in his elimination; it is a case of legitimate defence (cf. Evangelium Vitae, n. 55). Nevertheless, the prerequisites of legitimate personal defence are not applicable in the social sphere without the risk of distortion. In fact, when the death penalty is applied, people are killed not for current acts of aggression, but for offences committed in the past. Moreover, it is applied to people whose capacity to cause harm is not current, but has already been neutralized, and who are deprived of their freedom. [...]\n\nFor a constitutional State the death penalty represents a failure, because it obliges the State to kill in the name of justice [...] Justice is never reached by killing a human being. [...] The death penalty loses all legitimacy due to the defective selectivity of the criminal justice system and in the face of the possibility of judicial error. Human justice is imperfect, and the failure to recognize its fallibility can transform it into a source of injustice. With the application of capital punishment, the person sentenced is denied the possibility to make amends or to repent of the harm done; the possibility of [[Sacrament of Penance|confession]], with which man expresses his inner conversion; and of [[contrition]], the means of [[Repentance (Christianity)|repentance]] and atonement, in order to reach the encounter with the merciful and healing love of God. Furthermore, capital punishment is a frequent practice to which [[totalitarian]] regimes and fanatical groups resort, for the extermination of political dissidents, minorities, and every individual labelled as \"dangerous\" or who might be perceived as a threat to their power or to the attainment of their objectives. As in the first centuries and also in the current one, the Church suffers from the application of this penalty to her new martyrs.\n\nThe death penalty is contrary to the meaning of ''[[humanitas]]'' and to [[divine mercy]], which must be models for human justice. It entails cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment, as is the anguish before the moment of execution and the terrible suspense between the issuing of the sentence and the execution of the penalty, a form of \"torture\" which, in the name of correct procedure, tends to last many years, and which oftentimes leads to illness and insanity on death row.<ref name=\"letter\">{{cite web|title=LETTER OF HIS HOLINESS POPE FRANCIS TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION AGAINST THE DEATH PENALTY |url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/letters/2015/documents/papa-francesco_20150320_lettera-pena-morte.html |website=Vatican |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522173223/http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/letters/2015/documents/papa-francesco_20150320_lettera-pena-morte.html |archivedate=22 May 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nShortly prior to Francis's address, the Vatican had officially given support to a 2015 [[United Nations]] campaign against the death penalty.<ref name=\"gibson\"/> During a U.N.

In others, there is variation in the use of capital punishment. Some Islamic or Muslim-majority nations like the [[Republic of Turkey]] have abolished the death penalty.\n\nCapital punishment for [[apostasy in Islam]] and [[Rajm|stoning to death in Islam]] are controversial topics. Similarly, the discriminatory option between capital punishment and monetary compensation for crimes such as murder is controversial, where jurists have asked if poor offenders face trial and capital punishment while wealthy offenders are able to avoid a trial by paying off the Qisas compensation money.<ref>[http://tribune.com.pk/story/612946/shahzeb-khan-murder-sc-delays-qisas-hearing-by-10-days/ \"Qisas being used by the wealthy to avoid trial: CJ\"].
