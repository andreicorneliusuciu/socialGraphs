These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behaviour, and or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics.\n\nThe word \"robot\" was introduced to the public by Czech writer [[Karel \u010capek]] in his play [[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]], published in 1920. The term \"robotics\" was coined by [[Isaac Asimov]] in his 1941 science fiction short-story \"[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]\"<ref>According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]],'' the term \"robotics\" was first used in the short story \"Liar!\" published in the May, 1941 issue of ''Astounding Science Fiction.''</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n== Nature of robotics ==\nRobotics can be described as:\n\n* An [[applied science]] &ndash; scientific knowledge transferred into a physical environment.\n** A branch of [[computer science]] &ndash;\n** A branch of [[electrical engineering]] &ndash;\n** A branch of [[mechanical engineering]] &ndash;\n* [[Research and development]] &ndash;\n* A branch of [[technology]]   &ndash;\n\n== Branches of robotics ==\n\n* [[Adaptive control]] &ndash; control method used by a controller which must adapt to a controlled system with parameters which vary, or are initially uncertain.
