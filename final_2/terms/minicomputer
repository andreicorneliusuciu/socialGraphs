In a 1970 survey, the ''[[New York Times]]'' suggested a consensus definition of a minicomputer as a machine costing less than {{USD|25,000}}, with an input-output device such as a teleprinter and at least four thousand words of memory, that is capable of running programs in a higher level language, such as [[Fortran]] or [[BASIC]].<ref name=\"Smith 1970\">{{cite news | title=Maxi Computers Face Mini Conflict: Mini Trend Reaching Computers | last=Smith |first=William D. | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | date=April 5, 1970}}</ref> The class formed a distinct group with its own software architectures and operating systems. Minis were designed for control, instrumentation, human interaction, and communication switching as distinct from calculation and record keeping. Many were sold indirectly to [[Original equipment manufacturer|Original Equipment Manufacturers]] (OEMs) for final end use application. During the two decade lifetime of the minicomputer class (1965\u20131985), almost 100 companies formed and only a half dozen remained.<ref name=\"Bell 2013\">{{cite news | title=Rise and Fall of Minicomputers = http://ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/STARS:Rise_and_Fall_of_Minicomputers | last=Bell |first=C.

The term \"minicomputer\" is little used today; the contemporary term for this class of system is \"[[midrange computer]]\", such as the higher-end [[SPARC]], [[Power Architecture]] and [[Itanium]]-based systems from [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[IBM]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1960s: Origin; 1970s: Market entrenchment===\nThe term \"minicomputer\" developed in the 1960s to describe the smaller computers that became possible with the use of [[transistors]] and [[core memory]] technologies, minimal instructions sets and less expensive peripherals such as the ubiquitous [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR. They usually took up one or a few [[19-inch rack]] cabinets, compared with the large [[mainframe computer|mainframes]] that could fill a room.\n\n<!--- Left this in since the edit might be disputed\nThe first minicomputer was created in the USSR in 1958\u20131962. The computer, designated UM-1NKh, was produced at the Leningrad Electromechanical Plant (LEMZ) from 1963.<ref>Magazine: Control Electronics, 1966, vol. 5</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Malinovsky|first=Boris|title=\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0432\u044b\u0447\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0432 \u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430\u0445|trans_title=Pioneers of Soviet Computing|year=1995|pages=300\u2013305|chapter=6. \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0443\u0447\u0451\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u0410\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438|trans_chapter=6.

Later versions of the PDP-8 took advantage of small-scale [[integrated circuit]]s. The important precursors of the PDP-8 include the [[PDP-5]], [[LINC]], the [[TX-0]], the [[TX-2]], and the [[PDP-1]]. DEC gave rise to a number of minicomputer companies along [[Massachusetts Route 128]], including [[Data General]], [[Wang Laboratories]], [[Apollo Computer]], and [[Prime Computer]].\n\nMinicomputers were also known as midrange computers. They grew to have relatively high processing power and capacity. They were used in manufacturing process control, telephone switching and to control laboratory equipment. In the 1970s, they were the hardware that was used to launch the [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) industry and other similar industries where a smaller dedicated system was needed.\n\nThe [[7400 series]] of [[transistor-transistor logic|TTL]] [[integrated circuit]]s started appearing in minicomputers in the late 1960s. The [[74181]] [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU) was commonly used in the [[central processing unit|CPU]] data paths. Each 74181 had a bus width of four bits, hence the popularity of ''bit-slice'' architecture. Some scientific computers like [[Nicolette 1080]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.versci.com/pdffiles/nic80um.pdf |title=Nicolette 1080 Series, Data Acquisition and Processing System, Description and Specifications |access-date=May 28, 2016 |author=Nicolette Instruments Corporation |date=February 1, 1972 |editorial= |language=english |cita= }}</ref> would use the 7400 series in groups of five ICs (parallel) for their uncommon twenty bits architecture. The 7400 series offered data-selectors, [[multiplexer]]s, three-state buffers, memories, etc. in [[dual in-line package]]s with one-tenth inch spacing, making major system components and architecture evident to the naked eye. Starting in the 1980s, many minicomputers used [[VLSI]] circuits.\n\nAt the launch of the [[MITS Altair 8800]] in 1975, ''[[Radio Electronics]]'' magazine referred to the system as a \"minicomputer\", although the term [[microcomputer]] soon became usual for personal computers based on single-chip [[microprocessor]]s. At the time, microcomputers were 8-bit single-user, relatively simple machines running simple program-launcher operating systems like [[CP/M]] or [[MS-DOS]], while minis were much more powerful systems that ran full multi-user, [[multitasking]] operating systems, such as [[OpenVMS|VMS]] and [[Unix]], and although the classical mini was a [[16-bit]] computer, the emerging higher performance [[superminicomputer|supermini]]s were [[32-bit]].\n\n===Mid-1980s, 1990s: The minis give way to the micros===\nThe decline of the minis happened due to the lower cost of microprocessor-based [[computer hardware|hardware]], the emergence of inexpensive and easily deployable [[local area network]] systems, the emergence of the [[68020]], [[80286]] and the [[80386]] microprocessors, and the desire of end-users to be less reliant on inflexible minicomputer manufacturers and IT departments or \"data centers\". The result was that minicomputers and [[computer terminal]]s were replaced by networked [[workstation]]s, [[server (computing)|file server]]s and [[IBM PC compatible|PC]]s in some installations, beginning in the latter half of the 1980s.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the change from minicomputers to inexpensive PC networks was cemented by the development of several versions of [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems that ran on the [[Intel]] [[x86]] microprocessor [[computer architecture|architecture]], including [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]] and [[OpenBSD]]. Also, the Microsoft Windows series of operating systems, beginning with [[Windows NT]], now included server versions that supported preemptive multitasking and other features required for servers.\n\nAs [[microprocessor]]s have become more powerful, the [[central processing unit|CPUs]] built up from multiple components&nbsp;\u2013 once the distinguishing feature differentiating mainframes and midrange systems from microcomputers&nbsp;\u2013 have become increasingly obsolete, even in the largest [[mainframe computer]]s.\n\n[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) was once the leading minicomputer manufacturer, at one time the second-largest computer company after [[IBM]]. But as the minicomputer declined in the face of generic Unix servers and Intel-based PCs, not only DEC, but almost every other minicomputer company including [[Data General]], [[Prime Computer|Prime]], [[Computervision]], [[Honeywell]] and [[Wang Laboratories]], many based in [[New England]] (hence the end of the [[Massachusetts Miracle]]), also collapsed or merged. DEC was sold to [[Compaq]] in 1998, while Data General was acquired by [[EMC Corporation]].\n\nToday only a few proprietary minicomputer architectures survive. The [[IBM System/38]] operating system, which introduced many advanced concepts, lives on with IBM's AS/400.  Realising the importance of the myriad lines of 'legacy code' (programs) written, 'AS' stands for 'Application System'.  Great efforts were made by IBM to enable programs originally written for the [[IBM System/34|System/34]] and System/36 to be moved to the AS/400. The AS/400 was replaced by the [[iSeries]], which was subsequently replaced by the System i.  In 2008, the System i was replaced by the [[IBM Power Systems]]. By contrast, competing proprietary computing architectures from the early 1980s, such as DEC's [[VAX]], [[Wang VS]] and Hewlett Packard's [[HP3000]] have long been discontinued without a compatible upgrade path. [[OpenVMS]] runs HP Alpha and Intel IA64 ([[Itanium]]) CPU architectures.\n\n[[Tandem Computers]], which specialized in reliable large-scale computing, was acquired by [[Compaq]], and a few years afterward the combined entity merged with [[Hewlett Packard]]. The NSK-based [[NonStop]] product line was re-ported from MIPS processors to Itanium-based processors branded as '[[HP Integrity]] NonStop Servers'. As in the earlier migration from stack machines to MIPS microprocessors, all customer software was carried forward without source changes. Integrity NonStop continues to be HP's answer for the extreme scaling needs of its very largest customers.  The NSK operating system, now termed [[NonStop OS]], continues as the base software environment for the NonStop Servers, and has been extended to include support for [[Java (Sun)|Java]] and integration with popular development tools like [[Microsoft Visual Studio|Visual Studio]] and [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]].\n\n===The minicomputer's industrial impact and heritage===\nA variety of companies emerged that built [[turnkey]] systems around minicomputers with specialized software and, in many cases, custom peripherals that addressed specialized problems such as [[computer aided design]], [[computer aided manufacturing]], [[process control]], [[manufacturing resource planning]], and so on. Many if not most minicomputers were sold through these [[original equipment manufacturer]]s and [[value-added reseller]]s.\n\nSeveral pioneering computer companies first built minicomputers, such as [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]], [[Data General]], and [[Hewlett-Packard|Hewlett-Packard (HP)]] (who now refers to its [[HP3000]] minicomputers as \"servers\" rather than \"minicomputers\"). And although today's PCs and servers are clearly microcomputers physically, architecturally their CPUs and operating systems have developed largely by integrating features from minicomputers.{{citation_needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nIn the software context, the relatively simple OSs for early microcomputers were usually inspired by minicomputer OSs (such as [[CP/M]]'s similarity to Digital's single user [[OS/8]] and [[RT-11]] and multi-user [[RSTS/E|RSTS]] time-sharing system). Also, the multiuser OSs of today are often either inspired by, or directly descended from, minicomputer OSs.{{citation_needed|date=January 2016}} [[UNIX]] was originally a minicomputer OS, while [[Architecture of Windows NT|Windows NT kernel]]<!-- namely the kernel, not a huge heap of M$ usermode crap -->\u2014the foundation for all current versions of [[Microsoft Windows]]-borrowed design ideas liberally from [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]]. Many of the first generation of PC programmers were educated on minicomputer systems.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n==List of some notable Minicomputers==\n*[[Control Data]]'s [[CDC 160A]] and [[CDC 1700]]\n*[[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] and [[VAX]] series\n*[[Data General Nova]]\n*[[Hewlett-Packard]] [[HP 3000]] series, [[HP 2100]] series, [[HP1000]] series.\n*[[Honeywell]]-[[Groupe Bull|Bull]] [[Honeywell Level 6|DPS 6/DPS 6000]] series\n*[[IBM midrange computer]]s\n*[[Interdata 7/32 and 8/32]]\n*[[Varian Data Machines|Varian]] 620 100 series\n*[[Norsk Data]] [[Nord-1]], [[Nord-10]], and [[Nord-100]]\n*[[Prime Computer]] Prime 50 series\n*[[Scientific Data Systems|SDS]] SDS-92\n*[[Systems Engineering Laboratories|SEL]], one of the first 32-bit real-time computer system manufacturers\n*[[Texas Instruments]] [[TI-990]]\n*[[Wang Laboratories]] 2200 and VS series\n*[[K-202]], first Polish minicomputer\n*[[UM-1NKh]] ([[:ru:\u0423\u041c-1\u041d\u0425|rus.]]), first russian minicomputer, produced since 1963.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[The Soul of a New Machine]]''&nbsp;\u2013 about the development of Data General\u2019s Eclipse/MV minicomputers in the early 1980s\n*[[Charles Babbage Institute]]\n*[[History of computing hardware (1960s\u2013present)]]\n*[[Superminicomputer]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Minicomputers}}\n*[http://www.technikum29.de/en/computer/early-computers Early mini computers], still runnable in a German computer museum\n*[http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/GBell-minicomputer-list.html A list of Minicomputers]\n\n{{Computer sizes}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Minicomputers|*Minicomputer]]\n[[Category:Classes of computers]]\n[[Category:American inventions]]"}]}}}}
