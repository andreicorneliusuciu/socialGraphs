Though snakebots can vary greatly in size and design, there are two qualities that all snakebots share.  First, their small cross section to length ratio allows them to move into, and maneuver through, tight spaces.  Second, their ability to change the shape of their body allows them to perform a wide range of behaviours, such as climbing stairs or tree trunks. Additionally, many snake robots are constructed by chaining together a number of independent links.  This redundancy makes them resistant to failure, because they can continue to operate even if parts of their body are destroyed.\nProperties such as high [[terrainability]], redundancy,and the possibility of complete sealing of the body of the robot, make snake robots very interesting for practical applications and hence as a research topic.,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Transeth|first1=Aksel Andreas|last2=Pettersen|first2=Kristin Ytterstad|title=Developments in Snake Robot Modeling and Locomotion|journal=Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision, 2006.

These environments tend to be long and thin like pipes or highly cluttered like rubble.  Thus snakebots are currently being developed to assist search and rescue teams.\n\nFurthermore, when a task requires a number of different obstacles to be overcome, the locomotive flexibility of snakebots makes them good candidates.  For example, if you need a robot to carry a camera to the top of a tree that is growing in water you have to do three things: move over ground to the water's edge, swim to the tree, and then climb the tree.  You could make a robot that does any one of those three very well, but being able to do all three, and many other difficult combinations, is what makes snake robots exceptional.\n\nAlso, snakebots can be used by animal control officers to subdue rabid or invasive creatures.  Raccoons, barn cats, and large rodents typically respond to the snakebot's presence with attacks upon which the snakebot will emit an electrical shock and paralyze the aggressor.\n\n==Locomotion==\nTraditional snakebots locomote purely by changing the shape of their body, just like snakes.  Many variants have been created which use wheels or treads for locomotion.  No snakebots have been developed yet that can completely mimic the locomotion of real snakes, but researchers have been able to produce ways of moving that do not occur in nature.\n\nWhen researchers refer to how a snakebot moves they often refer to a specific [[gait]], where a gait is just a periodic mode of locomotion.  For example, [[sidewinding]] and [[lateral undulation]] are both gaits.  Snakebot gaits are often designed by investigating period changes to the shape of the robot.  You can think of a caterpillar moving by changing the shape of its body to match a sinusoidal wave.  Similarly, snakebots can move by adapting their shape to different periodic functions. Siderwinder rattlesnakes (''[[Crotalus cerastes]]'') can use sidewinding to ascend sandy slopes by increasing the portion of the body in contact with the sand to match the reduced yielding force of the inclined sand, allowing them to ascend up to [[Angle of repose|the maximum possible sand slope]] without slip.<ref name=\"sciencemag1\">{{cite web|last=Marvi |first=Hamidreza |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/346/6206/224.short |title=Sidewinding with minimal slip: Snake and robot ascent of sandy slopes &#124; Science |publisher=Sciencemag.org |date=2014-10-10 |accessdate=2016-05-04}}</ref>  Implementing this control scheme in a Snakebot capable of sidewinding allowed the robot to replicate the success of the snakes.<ref name=\"sciencemag1\"/>\n\n==Current research==\nSnakebots are currently being researched as a new type of [[robotic]], [[Interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary]] [[Space probe|probe]] by engineers at the [[NASA Ames Research Center]].\nSoftware for snakebots are also being developed by NASA for them to be able to learn by experience the skills to scale obstacles and remember the techniques.\n\nSnake robots are also being developed for [[search and rescue]] purposes at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s Biorobotics Lab.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Snake-arm robot]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://robotnor.no/expertise/robotic-systems/snake-robots ROBOTNOR - The Norwegian Centre for Advanced Robotics at NTNU and SINTEF]\n* [http://sintef.no/home/Information-and-Communication-Technology-ICT-old/Applied-Cybernetics/Projects/Our-snake-robots SINTEF's web pages]\n* [http://www.snakerobot.com Carnegie Mellon University's snake robots]\n* [http://www.modsnake.com Modular Snake Robots]\n* [http://www.engin.umich.edu/research/mrl/00MoRob_6.html University of Michigan's OmniTread Serpentine Robot]\n* [http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/snakebot.htm How Stuff Works Snakebot]\n* [http://www.snakerobots.com Robot Snakes of Dr. Gavin Miller]\n* [http://www.thinkbotics.com/serpentronic.htm Serpentronic Robot Snake Project]\n* [http://singularityhub.com/2010/09/02/carnegie-mellons-incredible-robot-snake-climbs-a-real-tree-video/ Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Incredible Robot Snake Climbs a Real Tree]\n* [http://www.militaryaerospace.com/articles/print/volume-11/issue-11/features/special-report/the-next-new-frontier-of-artificial-intelligence.html]\n* [http://www.sneel.co Sneel Swimming Snake Robot]\n\n[[Category:Robotic snakes| ]]"}]}}}}
