This is distinct from [[black body]] [[light emission]] resulting from heat ([[incandescence]]), from a chemical reaction ([[chemiluminescence]]), sound ([[sonoluminescence]]), or other mechanical action ([[mechanoluminescence]]).\n\n==Mechanism==\nElectroluminescence is the result of [[radiative recombination]] of [[electron]]s and [[electron hole|hole]]s in a material, usually a [[semiconductor]]. The excited electrons release their energy as [[photon]]s - light. Prior to recombination, electrons and holes may be separated either by [[doping (semiconductors)|doping]] the material to form a [[p-n junction]] (in semiconductor electroluminescent devices such as [[light-emitting diode]]s) or through excitation by impact of high-energy electrons accelerated by a strong electric field (as with the [[phosphor]]s in [[electroluminescent display]]s).\n\nIt has been recently shown that as a solar cell improves its light-to-electricity efficiency (improved open-circuit voltage), it will also improve its electricity-to-light (EL) efficiency<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Raguse|first1=John|title=Correlation of Electroluminescence with Open-CIrcuit Voltage from Thin-Film CdTe Solar Cells|journal=Journal of Photovoltaics|date=April 15, 2015|pages=4|doi=10.1109/JPHOTOV.2015.2417761|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7086293&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D7086293}}</ref>\n\n==Examples of electroluminescent materials==\nElectroluminescent devices are fabricated using either organic or inorganic electroluminescent materials. The active materials are generally semiconductors of wide enough bandwidth to allow exit of the light.\n\nThe most typical inorganic thin-film EL (TFEL) is ZnS:Mn with yellow-orange emission. Examples of the range of EL material include:\n* Powdered [[zinc sulfide]] [[dopant|doped]] with [[copper]] (producing greenish light) or [[silver]] (producing bright blue light)\n* Thin-film [[zinc sulfide]] doped with [[manganese]] (producing orange-red color)\n* Naturally blue [[diamond]], which includes a trace of [[boron]] that acts as a dopant.\n* Semiconductors containing [[Group (periodic table)|Group]] III and Group V elements, such as [[Indium phosphide|indium phosphide (InP)]], [[Gallium arsenide|gallium arsenide (GaAs)]], and [[Gallium nitride|gallium nitride (GaN)]].\n* Certain organic semiconductors, such as [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>(PF<sub>6</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>)<sub>2</sub>, where bpy is 2,2'-bipyridine\n\n==Practical implementations==\n[[Image:NightLight.jpg|right|thumbnail|An electroluminescent [[nightlight]] in operation (uses 0.08&nbsp;W at 230&nbsp;V, and dates from 1960; lit diameter 59&nbsp;mm)]]\nThe most common electroluminescent (EL) devices are composed of either powder (primarily used in lighting applications) or [[thin films]] (for information displays.)\n\n''Light-emitting capacitor'', or '''LEC''', is a term used since at least 1961 <ref>''Proceedings of the National Electronics Conference, Volume 17'', National Engineering Conference, Inc., 1961 ;  page 328</ref> to describe  electroluminescent panels. {{citation needed span|text=[[General Electric]] has patents dating to 1938 on flat electroluminescent panels|date=June 2014}} that are still made as [[night light]]s and backlights for [[Control panel (engineering)|instrument panel]] displays. The drawbacks of conventional electroluminescent lights are low efficiency and lifetimes limited to hundreds of hours. Electroluminescent panels are a [[capacitor]] where the [[dielectric]] between the outside plates is a [[phosphor]] that gives off [[photon]]s when the capacitor is charged.  By making one of the contacts transparent, the large area exposed emits light.<ref>Raymond Kane, Heinz Sell, ''Revolution in lamps: a chronicle of 50 years of progress, 2nd ed.'', The Fairmont Press, Inc., 2001 ISBN 0881733784,  pages 122\u2013124</ref>\n\nElectroluminescent automotive instrument panel backlighting, with each gauge pointer also an individual light source, entered production on 1960 Chrysler and Imperial passenger cars, and was continued successfully on several Chrysler vehicles through 1967.\n\nSylvania Lighting Division in Salem and Danvers, MA, produced and marketed an EL night lamp (right), under the trade name ''Panelescent'' at roughly the same time that the Chrysler instrument panels entered production. These lamps have proven incredibly reliable, with some samples known to be still functional after nearly 50 years of continuous operation.{{cn|date=July 2015}} Later in the 1960s, Sylvania's Electronic Systems Division in Needham, MA developed and manufactured several instruments for the Apollo Lunar Lander and Command Module using [[electroluminescent display]] panels manufactured by the Electronic Tube Division of Sylvania at Emporium, PA. Raytheon, Sudbury, MA,  manufactured the [[Apollo Guidance Computer|Apollo guidance computer]], which used a Sylvania electroluminescent display panel as part of its display-keyboard interface (DSKY).\n\nPowder phosphor-based electroluminescent panels are frequently used as [[backlight]]s to [[liquid crystal display]]s. They readily provide a gentle, even illumination to the entire display while consuming relatively little electric power. This makes them convenient for battery-operated devices such as [[pager]]s, [[wristwatch]]es, and computer-controlled [[thermostat]]s, and their gentle [[green]]-[[cyan]] glow is a common sight in the technological world. They do, however, require relatively high voltage (between 60 and 600 volts).<ref name=Handbook>Donald G. Fink and H. Wayne Beaty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition'', McGraw-Hill, New York, 1978, ISBN 0-07-020974-X  pp 22-28</ref> For battery-operated devices, this voltage must be generated by a converter circuit within the device; this converter often makes an audible whine or siren sound while the backlight is activated. For line-voltage-operated devices, it may be supplied directly from the power line. Electroluminescent [[nightlight]]s operate in this fashion. Brightness per unit area increases with increased voltage and frequency.<ref name=Handbook />\n\nThin film phosphor electroluminescence was first commercialized during the 1980s by [[Sharp Corporation]] in Japan, [[Finlux]] (Oy Lohja Ab) in Finland, and [[Planar Systems]] in the USA.  Here, bright, long-life light emission is achieved in thin film yellow-emitting manganese-doped zinc sulfide material.  Displays using this technology were manufactured for medical and vehicle applications where ruggedness and wide viewing angles were crucial, and liquid crystal displays were not well developed. In 1992, [[Timex Group USA|Timex]] introduced its [[Indiglo]] EL display on some watches.\n\nRecently, blue-, red-, and green-emitting thin film electroluminescent materials that offer the potential for long life and full color electroluminescent displays have been developed.\n\nIn either case, the EL material must be enclosed between two electrodes and at least one electrode must be transparent to allow the escape of the produced light. Glass coated with [[indium tin oxide]] is commonly used as the front (transparent) electrode while the back electrode is coated with reflective [[metal]].  Additionally, other transparent conducting materials, such as [[carbon nanotube]] coatings or [[PEDOT]] can be used as the front electrode.\n\nThe display applications are primarily passive (i.e., voltages are driven from edge of the display cf. driven from a transistor on the display). Similar to LCD trends, there have also been Active Matrix EL (AMEL) displays demonstrated, where circuitry is added to prolong voltages at each pixel.  The solid-state nature of TFEL allows for a very rugged and high-resolution display fabricated even on silicon substrates.  AMEL displays of 1280x1024 at over 1000 lines per inch (lpi) have been demonstrated by a consortium including Planar Systems.<ref>Ron Khormaei, et al., \"High Resolution Active Matrix Electroluminescent Display\", Society for Information Display Digest, p. 137, 1994.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.planar.com/support/design-resources/docs/overview.pdf |title=Active Matrix Electroluminescence (AMEL)}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Rogers Shine-01.jpg|thumbnail|left|The world's first electroluminescent [[billboard]] campaign, Canada, Winter 2005]]Electroluminescent technologies have low power consumption compared to competing lighting technologies, such as neon or [[fluorescent lamp]]s. This, together with the thinness of the material, has made EL technology valuable to the advertising industry. Relevant advertising applications include electroluminescent billboards and signs. EL manufacturers are able to control precisely which areas of an electroluminescent sheet illuminate, and when. This has given advertisers the ability to create more dynamic advertising that is still compatible with traditional advertising spaces.\n\nAn EL film is a so-called [[Lambertian reflectance|Lambertian radiator]]: unlike with neon lamps, filament lamps, or LEDs, the brightness of the surface appears the same from all angles of view; electroluminescent light is not directional and therefore hard to compare with (thermal) light sources measured in lumens or lux. The light emitted from the surface is perfectly homogeneous and is well-perceived by the eye. EL film produces single-frequency (monochromatic) light that has a very narrow bandwidth, is absolutely uniform and visible from a great distance.\n\n[[Image:66ChargerDash2.jpg|right|thumb|1966 [[Dodge Charger]] instrument panel with electroluminescent lighting. [[Chrysler]] first introduced cars with EL panel lighting in its 1960 model year.]]\nIn principle, EL lamps can be made in any color.  However, the commonly used greenish color closely matches the peak sensitivity of human vision, producing the greatest apparent light output for the least electrical power input.  Unlike neon and fluorescent lamps, EL lamps are not [[negative resistance]] devices so no extra circuitry is needed to regulate the amount of current flowing through them.\nA new technology now being used is based on multispectral phosphors that emit light from 600 to 400nm depending on the drive frequency; this is similar to the colour changing effect seen with aqua EL sheet but on a larger scale.\n\nElectroluminescent lighting is now used as an application for public safety identification involving alphanumeric characters on the roof of vehicles for clear visibility from an aerial perspective.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.Air-EL.com/ |title=air-el |publisher=Federal Signal |access-date=July 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nElectroluminescent lighting, especially [[electroluminescent wire]] (EL wire), has also made its way into [[clothing]] as many designers have brought this technology to the entertainment and night life industry.<ref>Diana Eng. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wn9cPkCtzcsC \"Fashion Geek: Clothes Accessories Tech\"]. 2009.</ref>\n\nEngineers have developed an electroluminescent \"skin\" that can stretch more than six times its original size while still emitting light. This hyper-elastic light-emitting capacitor (HLEC) can endure more than twice the strain of previously tested stretchable displays. It consists of layers of transparent hydrogel electrodes sandwiching an insulating elastomer sheet. The elastomer changes luminance and capacitance when stretched, rolled and otherwise deformed. In addition to its ability to emit light under a strain of greater than 480 percent its original size, the group's HLEC was shown to be capable of being integrated into a [[soft robotics|soft robotic]] system. Three six-layer HLEC panels were bound together to form a crawling soft robot, with the top four layers making up the light-up skin and the bottom two the pneumatic actuators. The discovery could lead to significant advances in health care, transportation, electronic communication and other areas.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/03/160303150224.htm|title=Super elastic electroluminescent 'skin' will soon create mood robots|last=Cornell University|date=March 3, 2016|work=Science Daily|access-date=March 4, 2016|via=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Electrochemiluminescence]]\n*[[Illuminator (backlight)]]\n*[[List of light sources]]\n*[[OLED]]\n*[[Photoelectric effect]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Electroluminescence}}\n* [http://www.indiana.edu/~hightech/fpd/papers/ELDs.html Overview of electroluminescent display technology, and the discovery of electroluminescence]\n* [http://www.imperialclub.com/Yr/1960/Panelescent/index.htm Chrysler Corporation press release introducing Panelescent (EL) Lighting on 8 September, 1959.]\n\n{{Artificial light sources}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Condensed matter physics]]\n[[Category:Electrical phenomena]]\n[[Category:Light sources]]\n[[Category:Lighting]]\n[[Category:Luminescence]]"}]}}}}
