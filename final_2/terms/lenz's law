Lenz's Law explains the direction of many  effects in [[electromagnetism]], such as the direction of voltage induced in an [[inductor]] or wire loop by a changing current, or why [[eddy current]]s exert a drag force on moving objects in a magnetic field.   \n\nLenz's law can be seen as analogous to [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's third law|Newton's third law]] in classic mechanics.<ref name=\"Electromagnetics explained:\na handbook for wireless/RF, EMC, and high-speed electronics\">Schmitt, Ron.

If these currents are in two coaxial circular conductors ''\u2113''<sub>1</sub> and ''\u2113''<sub>2</sub> respectively, and both are initially 0, then the currents ''i''<sub>1</sub> and ''i''<sub>2</sub> must counter-rotate. The opposing currents will repel each other as a result.\n\nLenz's law states that the current induced in a circuit due to a change or a motion in a magnetic field is so directed as to oppose the change in flux and to exert a mechanical force opposing the motion.\n\n===Example===\nCurrents bound inside the atoms of strong magnets can create counter-rotating currents in a copper or aluminum pipe. This is shown by dropping the magnet through the pipe. The descent of the magnet inside the pipe is observably slower than when dropped outside the pipe.\n\nWhen a voltage is generated by a change in magnetic flux according to Faraday's Law, the polarity of the induced voltage is such that it produces a current whose magnetic field opposes the change which produces it. The induced magnetic field inside any loop of wire always acts to keep the magnetic flux in the loop constant. In the examples below, if the flux is increasing, the induced field acts in opposition to it. If it is decreasing, the induced field acts in the direction of the applied field to oppose the change.\n\n==Detailed interaction of charges in these currents==\n[[File:19. \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0446\u043e\u0432\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e - \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0430\u043d.ogg|thumb|280px|Aluminium ring moved by electromagnetic induction, thus demonstrating Lenz's law.

One ring is fully enclosed, while the other has an opening, not forming a complete circle. When we place a [[:en:magnet|bar magnet]] near the fully enclosed ring, the ring is repulsed by it. However, when the system comes to a rest, and we remove the bar magnet, then the ring is attracted by it. In the first case, the induced current created in the ring resists the increase of [[magnetic flux]] caused by the proximity of the magnet, while in the latter, taking the magnet out of the ring decreases the magnetic flux, inducing such current whose [[magnetic field]] resists the decrease of flux. This phenomenon is absent when we repeat the experiment with the ring that isn't enclosed by inserting and removing the magnet bar. The induced currents in this ring can't enclose themselves in the ring, and have a very weak field that cannot resist the change of the magnetic flux.

The net work on ''q''<sub>1</sub> thereby generates a magnetic field whose strength (in units of magnetic flux density (1 [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] = 1 volt-second per square meter)) is proportional to the speed increase of ''q''<sub>1</sub>. This magnetic field can interact with a neighboring charge ''q''<sub>2</sub>, passing on this momentum to it, and in return,  ''q''<sub>1</sub> loses momentum.\n\nThe charge ''q''<sub>2</sub> can also act on  ''q''<sub>1</sub> in a similar manner, by which it returns some of the momentum that it received from  ''q''<sub>1</sub>. This back-and-forth component of momentum contributes to magnetic [[inductance]]. The closer that ''q''<sub>1</sub> and ''q''<sub>2</sub> are, the greater the effect. When ''q''<sub>2</sub> is inside a conductive medium such as a thick slab made of copper or aluminum, it more readily responds to the force applied to it by ''q''<sub>1</sub>. The energy of ''q''<sub>1</sub> is not instantly consumed as heat generated by the current of ''q''<sub>2</sub> but is also stored in ''two'' opposing magnetic fields. The energy density of magnetic fields tends to vary with the square of the magnetic field's intensity; however, in the case of magnetically non-linear materials such as [[ferromagnetic|ferromagnets]] and [[superconductors]], this [[Magnetic field#Energy stored in magnetic fields|relationship]] breaks down.\n\n==Field energy==\n\nThe electric field stores energy.  The energy density of the electric field is given by:\n\n:<math> u = \\frac{1}{2} \\varepsilon |\\mathbf{E}|^2 \\, ,</math>\n\n\n\nIn general the incremental amount of work per unit volume ''<math>\\delta W</math>'' needed to cause a small change of magnetic flux density ''<math>\\delta</math>'''''B''' is:\n\n:<math>\\delta W = \\mathbf{H}\\cdot\\delta\\mathbf{B}.</math>\n\n==Conservation of momentum==\nMomentum must be conserved in the process, so if ''q''<sub>1</sub> is pushed in one direction, then ''q''<sub>2</sub> ought to be pushed in the other direction by the same force at the same time. However, the situation becomes more complicated when the finite speed of electromagnetic wave propagation is introduced (see [[retarded potential]]). This means that for a brief period the total momentum of the two charges is not conserved, implying that the difference should be accounted for by momentum in the fields, as asserted by [[Richard P. Feynman]].<ref name=\"The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Volume I, Chapter 10, Page 9.\">''The Feynman Lectures on Physics'': Volume I, Chapter 10, Page 9.</ref> Famous 19th century electrodynamicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] called this the \"electromagnetic momentum\".<ref>Maxwell, James C.

Retrieved 16 July 2010.</ref> Yet, such a treatment of fields may be necessary when Lenz's law is applied to opposite charges. It is normally assumed that the charges in question have the same sign. If they do not, such as a proton and an electron, the interaction is different. An electron generating a magnetic field would generate an EMF that causes a proton to accelerate in the same direction as the electron. At first, this might seem to violate the law of conservation of momentum, but such an interaction is seen to conserve momentum if the momentum of electromagnetic fields is taken into account.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/community/slideshows/eddycurrents/index.html Eddy Currents and Lenz's Law] (audio slideshow from the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory)\n* [http://video.mit.edu/watch/physics-demo-lenzs-law-with-copper-pipe-10268/ MIT A brief video demonstrating Lenz's law]\n* {{YouTube|fxC-AEC0ROk|A dramatic demonstration of the effect}} with an [[aluminum]] block in an [[MRI]]\n* [http://www.wimp.com/copperpipe/ Eddy currents produced by magnet and copper pipe.]\n\n[[Category:Magnetic levitation]]\n[[Category:Electrodynamics]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]"}]}}}}
