A single [[point (geometry)|point]] may be considered a 0-simplex, and a [[line segment]] may be considered a 1-simplex. A simplex may be defined as the smallest [[convex set]] containing the given vertices.\n\nA '''regular simplex'''<ref>{{citation | last = Elte | first = E. L. | title = The Semiregular Polytopes of the Hyperspaces | publisher = University of Groningen | location = Groningen | year = 1912}} Chapter IV, five dimensional semiregular polytope</ref> is a simplex that is also a [[regular polytope]]. A regular ''n''-simplex may be constructed from a regular (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)-simplex by connecting a new vertex to all original vertices by the common edge length.\n\nIn [[topology]] and [[combinatorics]], it is common to \u201cglue together\u201d simplices to form a [[simplicial complex]].  The associated combinatorial structure is called an [[abstract simplicial complex]], in which context the word \u201csimplex\u201d simply means any [[finite set]] of vertices.\n\n== Examples ==\n* A 0-simplex is a [[point (mathematics)|point]].\n* A 1-simplex is a [[line segment]].\n* A 2-simplex is a [[triangle]].\n* A 3-simplex is a [[tetrahedron]].\n\n== Elements ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Simplicial complex]] -->\nThe convex hull of any nonempty subset of the ''n''+1 points that define an n-simplex is called a '''''face''''' of the simplex. Faces are simplices themselves. In particular, the convex hull of a subset of size ''m''+1 (of the ''n''+1 defining points) is an m-simplex, called an '''''m''-face''' of the n-simplex. The 0-faces (i.e., the defining points themselves as sets of size 1) are called the '''vertices''' (singular: vertex), the 1-faces are called the '''edges''', the (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)-faces are called the '''facets''', and the sole ''n''-face is the whole ''n''-simplex itself. In general, the number of ''m''-faces is equal to the [[binomial coefficient]] <math>\\tbinom{n+1}{m+1}</math>{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}. Consequently, the number of ''m''-faces of an ''n''-simplex may be found in column (''m'' + 1) of row (''n'' + 1) of [[Pascal's triangle]]. A simplex ''A'' is a '''coface''' of a simplex ''B'' if ''B'' is a face of ''A''. ''Face'' and ''facet'' can have different meanings when describing types of simplices in a [[simplicial complex]]; see [[Simplicial complex#Definitions|simplical complex]] for more detail.\n\nThe '''regular simplex''' family is the first of three [[regular polytope]] families, labeled by [[Coxeter]] as ''\u03b1<sub>n</sub>'', the other two being the [[cross-polytope]] family, labeled as ''\u03b2<sub>n</sub>'', and the [[hypercube]]s, labeled as ''\u03b3<sub>n</sub>''. A fourth family, the [[hypercubic honeycomb|infinite tessellation of hypercubes]], he labeled as ''\u03b4<sub>n</sub>''.\n\nThe number of ''1''-faces (edges) of the ''n''-simplex is the ''n''-th [[triangle number]], the number of ''2''-faces of the ''n''-simplex is the (''n''-1)th [[tetrahedron number]], the number of ''3''-faces of the ''n''-simplex is the (''n''-2)th 5-cell number, and so on.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ n-Simplex elements<ref>{{SloanesRef |sequencenumber=A135278|name=Pascal's triangle with its left-hand edge removed}}</ref>\n|- \n! \u0394<sup>n</sup>\n!

An (''m''+''n''+1)-simplex can be constructed as a join of an ''m''-simplex and an ''n''-simplex. The two simplices are oriented to be completely normal from each other, with translation in a direction orthogonal to both of them. A 1-simplex is a joint of two points: ( )\u2228( ) = 2.( ). A general 2-simplex (scalene triangle) is the join of 3 points: ( )\u2228( )\u2228( ). An [[isosceles triangle]] is the join of a 1-simplex and a point: { }\u2228( ). An [[equilateral triangle]] is 3.( ) or {3}. A general 3-simplex is the join of 4 points: ( )\u2228( )\u2228( )\u2228( ). A 3-simplex with mirror symmetry can be expressed as the join of an edge and 2 points: { }\u2228( )\u2228( ). A 3-simplex with triangular symmetry can be expressed as the join of an equilateral triangle and 1 point: 3.( )\u2228( ) or {3}\u2228( ).

Such a general simplex is often called an '''affine ''n''-simplex''', to emphasize that the canonical map is an [[affine transformation]]. It is also sometimes called an '''oriented affine ''n''-simplex''' to emphasize that the canonical map may be [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation preserving]] or reversing.\n\nMore generally, there is a canonical map from the standard <math>(n-1)</math>-simplex (with ''n'' vertices) onto any [[polytope]] with ''n'' vertices, given by the same equation (modifying indexing):\n:<math>(t_1,\\cdots,t_n) \\mapsto \\sum_{i = 1}^n t_i v_i</math>\nThese are known as [[generalized barycentric coordinates]], and express every polytope as the ''image'' of a simplex: <math>\\Delta^{n-1} \\twoheadrightarrow P.</math>\n\n=== Examples ===\n\n* \u0394<sup>0</sup> is the point {{nowrap|1= 1 in '''R'''<sup>1</sup>}}.\n* \u0394<sup>1</sup> is the line segment joining (1,0) and (0,1) in '''R'''<sup>2</sup>.\n* \u0394<sup>2</sup> is the [[equilateral triangle]] with vertices (1,0,0), (0,1,0) and (0,0,1) in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>.\n* \u0394<sup>3</sup> is the [[regular tetrahedron]] with vertices (1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0) and (0,0,0,1) in '''R'''<sup>4</sup>.\n\n===Increasing coordinates===\nAn alternative coordinate system is given by taking the [[indefinite sum]]:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\ns_0 &= 0\\\\\ns_1 &= s_0 + t_0 = t_0\\\\\ns_2 &= s_1 + t_1 = t_0 + t_1\\\\\ns_3 &= s_2 + t_2 = t_0 + t_1 + t_2\\\\\n&\\dots\\\\\ns_n &= s_{n-1} + t_{n-1} = t_0 + t_1 + \\dots + t_{n-1}\\\\\ns_{n+1} &= s_n + t_n = t_0 + t_1 + \\dots + t_n = 1\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nThis yields the alternative presentation by ''order,'' namely as nondecreasing ''n''-tuples between 0 and 1:\n:<math>\\Delta_*^n = \\left\\{(s_1,\\cdots,s_n)\\in\\mathbb{R}^n\\mid 0 = s_0 \\leq s_1 \\leq s_2 \\leq \\dots \\leq s_n \\leq s_{n+1} = 1 \\right\\}.</math>\nGeometrically, this is an ''n''-dimensional subset of <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> (maximal dimension, codimension 0) rather than of <math>\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}</math> (codimension 1). The facets, which on the standard simplex correspond to one coordinate vanishing, <math>t_i=0,</math> here correspond to successive coordinates being equal, <math>s_i=s_{i+1},</math> while the interior corresponds to the inequalities becoming ''strict'' (increasing sequences).\n\nA key distinction between these presentations is the behavior under permuting coordinates \u2013 the standard simplex is stabilized by permuting coordinates, while permuting elements of the \"ordered simplex\" do not leave it invariant, as permuting an ordered sequence generally makes it unordered. Indeed, the ordered simplex is a (closed) [[fundamental domain]] for the action of the symmetric group on the ''n''-cube, meaning that the orbit of the ordered simplex under the ''n''! elements of the symmetric group divides the ''n''-cube into <math>n!</math> mostly disjoint simplices (disjoint except for boundaries), showing that this simplex has volume <math>1/n!</math> Alternatively, the volume can be computed by an iterated integral, whose successive integrands are <math>1,x,x^2/2,x^3/3!,\\dots,x^n/n!</math>\n\nA further property of this presentation is that it uses the order but not addition, and thus can be defined in any dimension over any ordered set, and for example can be used to define an infinite-dimensional simplex without issues of convergence of sums.\n\n===Projection onto the standard simplex===\nEspecially in numerical applications of [[probability theory]] a [[Graphical projection|projection]] onto the standard simplex is of interest.

This is the simplex used in the [[simplex method]], which is based at the origin, and locally models a vertex on a polytope with ''n'' facets.\n\n==Cartesian coordinates for regular ''n''-dimensional simplex in R<sup>''n''</sup>==\nThe coordinates of the vertices of a regular ''n''-dimensional simplex can be obtained from these two properties,\n# For a regular simplex, the distances of its vertices to its center are equal.\n# The angle subtended by any two vertices of an ''n''-dimensional simplex through its center is <math>\\arccos\\left(\\tfrac{-1}{n}\\right)</math>\n\nThese can be used as follows. Let vectors (''v''<sub>0</sub>, ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>) represent the vertices of an ''n''-simplex center the origin, all [[unit vector]]s so a distance 1 from the origin, satisfying the first property. The second property means the [[dot product]] between any pair of the vectors is <math>-1/n</math>. This can be used to calculate positions for them.\n\nFor example in three dimensions the vectors (''v''<sub>0</sub>, ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, ''v''<sub>3</sub>) are the vertices of a 3-simplex or tetrahedron.

The following assertions hold:\n\nIf ''P'' is the unit n-hypercube, then the union of the n-simplexes formed by the convex hull of each n-path is ''P'', and these simplexes are congruent and pairwise non-overlapping.<ref>Every n-path corresponding to a permutation <math>\\scriptstyle \\sigma</math> is the image of the n-path\n<math>\\scriptstyle v_0,\\ v_0+e_{1},\\ v_0+e_{1}+e_{2},\\ldots v_0+e_{1}+\\cdots + e_n</math>\nby the affine isometry that sends <math>\\scriptstyle v_0</math> to <math>\\scriptstyle v_0</math>, and whose linear part matches <math>\\scriptstyle e_i</math> to <math>\\scriptstyle e_{\\sigma(i)}</math> for all i. hence every two n-paths are isometric, and so is their convex hulls; \nthis explains the congruence of the simplexes. To show the other assertions, it suffices to remark that the interior of the simplex determined by the n-path <math>\\scriptstyle v_0,\\ v_0+e_{\\sigma(1)},\\ v_0+e_{\\sigma(1)}+e_{\\sigma(2)}\\ldots v_0+e_{\\sigma(1)}+\\cdots + e_{\\sigma(n)}</math> is the set of points <math>\\scriptstyle v_0 + (x_1+\\cdots +x_n) e_{\\sigma(1)} + \\cdots + (x_{n-1}+x_n) e_{\\sigma(n-1)} + x_n e_{\\sigma(n)}</math>, with <math>\\scriptstyle 0< x_i < 1</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle x_1+\\cdots + x_n < 1.</math> Hence the components of these points with respect to each corresponding permuted basis are strictly ordered in the decreasing order. That explains why the simplexes are non-overlapping. The fact that the union of the simplexes is the whole unit n-hypercube follows as well, replacing the strict inequalities above by \"<math>\\scriptstyle \\leq</math>\". The same arguments are also valid for a general parallelotope, except the isometry between the simplexes.</ref> In particular, the volume of such a simplex is \n:<math>{\\rm Vol}\\ (P)/n! = 1/n!</math>.  \nIf ''P'' is a general parallelotope, the same assertions hold except that it is no more true, in dimension > 2, that the simplexes need to be pairwise congruent; yet their volumes remain equal, because the n-parallelotop is the image of the unit n-hypercube by the linear isomorphism that sends the canonical basis of <math>\\mathbf R^n</math> to <math>e_1,\\ldots, e_n</math>. As previously, this implies that the volume of a simplex coming from a n-path is:\n:<math>{\\rm Vol}(P)/n! = \\det(e_1, \\ldots, e_n)/n!.</math>\nConversely, given a n-simplex <math>(v_0,\\ v_1,\\ v_2,\\ldots v_n)</math> of <math>\\mathbf R^n</math>, it can be supposed that the vectors <math>e_1 = v_1-v_0,\\ e_2 = v_2-v_1,\\ldots e_n=v_n-v_{n-1}</math> form a basis of <math>\\mathbf R^n</math>. Considering the parallelotope constructed from <math>v_0</math> and <math>e_1,\\ldots, e_n</math>, one sees that the previous formula is valid for every simplex.\n\nFinally, the formula at the beginning of this section obtains by observing that \n:<math>\\det(v_1-v_0, v_2-v_0,\\ldots v_n-v_0) = \\det(v_1-v_0, v_2-v_1,\\ldots, v_n-v_{n-1}).</math>\n\nFrom this formula, it follows immediately that the volume under a standard ''n''-simplex (i.e. between the origin and the simplex in '''R'''<sup>n+1</sup>) is\n\n:<math>\n{1 \\over (n+1)!}\n</math>\n\nThe volume of a regular ''n''-simplex with unit side length is\n\n:<math>\n{\\frac{\\sqrt{n+1}}{n!\\sqrt{2^n}}}\n</math>\n\nas can be seen by multiplying the previous formula by ''x''<sup>''n+1''</sup>, to get the volume under the ''n''-simplex as a function of its vertex distance ''x'' from the origin, differentiating with respect to ''x'', at <math>x=1/\\sqrt{2}</math>&nbsp;&nbsp; (where the ''n''-simplex side length is 1), and normalizing by the length <math>dx/\\sqrt{n+1}\\,</math> of the increment, <math>(dx/(n+1),\\dots, dx/(n+1))</math>, along the normal vector.\n\nThe [[dihedral angle]] of a regular ''n''-dimensional simplex is cos<sup>\u22121</sup>(1/''n''),<ref>{{cite journal | journal = The American Mathematical Monthly | publisher = Mathematical Association of America | volume = 109 | issue = 8 | date = October 2002 | pages = 756\u2013758 | title = An Elementary Calculation of the Dihedral Angle of the Regular n-Simplex | first1 = Harold R. | last1 = Parks | author1-link = Harold R.

Such simplexes are generalizations of right angle triangles and for them there exists an n-dimensional version of the [[Pythagorean theorem]]:\n\nThe sum of the squared (n-1)-dimensional volumes of the facets adjacent to the orthogonal corner equals the squared (n-1)-dimensional volume of the facet opposite of the orthogonal corner.\n\n:<math> \\sum_{k=1}^{n} |A_{k}|^2 = |A_{0}|^2 </math>\nwhere <math> A_{1} \\ldots A_{n} </math> are facets being pairwise orthogonal to each other but not orthogonal to <math> A_{0} </math>, which is the facet opposite the orthogonal corner.\n\nFor a 2-simplex the theorem is the [[Pythagorean theorem]] for triangles with a right angle and for a 3-simplex it is [[de Gua's theorem]] for a tetrahedron \nwith a cube corner.\n\n===Relation to the (''n''+1)-hypercube===\nThe [[Hasse diagram]] of the face lattice of an ''n''-simplex is isomorphic to the graph of the (''n''+1)-[[hypercube]]'s edges, with the hypercube's vertices mapping to each of the ''n''-simplex's elements, including the entire simplex and the null polytope as the extreme points of the lattice (mapped to two opposite vertices on the hypercube). This fact may be used to efficiently enumerate the simplex's face lattice, since more general face lattice enumeration algorithms are more computationally expensive.\n\nThe ''n''-simplex is also the [[vertex figure]] of the (''n''+1)-hypercube. It is also the [[Facet (geometry)|facet]] of the (''n''+1)-[[orthoplex]].\n\n===Topology===\n[[Topology|Topologically]], an ''n''-simplex is [[topologically equivalent|equivalent]] to an [[ball (mathematics)|''n''-ball]]. Every ''n''-simplex is an ''n''-dimensional [[manifold with corners]].\n\n===Probability===\n{{Main article|Categorical distribution}}\n\nIn probability theory, the points of the standard ''n''-simplex in <math>(n+1)</math>-space are the space of possible parameters (probabilities) of the [[categorical distribution]] on ''n''+1 possible outcomes.\n\n== Algebraic topology ==\nIn [[algebraic topology]], simplices are used as building blocks to construct an interesting class of [[topological space]]s called [[simplicial complex]]es. These spaces are built from simplices glued together in a [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] fashion. Simplicial complexes are used to define a certain kind of [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] called [[simplicial homology]].\n\nA finite set of ''k''-simplexes embedded in an [[open subset]] of '''R'''<sup>n</sup> is called an '''affine ''k''-chain'''. The simplexes in a chain need not be unique; they may occur with [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]. Rather than using standard set notation to denote an affine chain, it is instead the standard practice to use plus signs to separate each member in the set. If some of the simplexes have the opposite [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]], these are prefixed by a minus sign. If some of the simplexes occur in the set more than once, these are prefixed with an integer count. Thus, an affine chain takes the symbolic form of a sum with integer coefficients.\n\nNote that each facet of an ''n''-simplex is an affine ''n-1''-simplex, and thus the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of an ''n''-simplex is an affine ''n-1''-chain. Thus, if we denote one positively oriented affine simplex as\n\n:<math>\\sigma=[v_0,v_1,v_2,...,v_n]</math>\n\nwith the <math>v_j</math> denoting the vertices, then the boundary <math>\\partial\\sigma</math> of \u03c3 is the chain\n\n:<math>\\partial\\sigma = \\sum_{j=0}^n \n(-1)^j [v_0,...,v_{j-1},v_{j+1},...,v_n]</math>.\n\nIt follows from this expression, and the linearity of the boundary operator,  that the boundary of the boundary of a simplex is zero:\n\n:<math>\\partial^2\\sigma = \\partial ( ~ \\sum_{j=0}^n \n(-1)^j [v_0,...,v_{j-1},v_{j+1},...,v_n]~ ) =0. </math>\n\nLikewise, the boundary of the boundary of a chain is zero:  <math> \\partial ^2 \\rho =0 </math>.\n\nMore generally, a simplex (and a chain) can be embedded into a [[manifold]] by means of smooth, differentiable map <math>f\\colon\\mathbb{R}^n\\rightarrow M</math>. In this case, both the summation convention for denoting the set, and the boundary operation commute with the embedding.  That is,\n\n:<math>f(\\sum\\nolimits_i a_i \\sigma_i) = \\sum\\nolimits_i a_i f(\\sigma_i)</math>\n\nwhere the <math>a_i</math> are the integers denoting orientation and multiplicity.  For the boundary operator <math>\\partial</math>, one has:\n\n:<math>\\partial f(\\rho) = f (\\partial \\rho)</math>\n\nwhere \u03c1 is a chain. The boundary operation commutes with the mapping because, in the end, the chain is defined as a set and little more, and the set operation always commutes with the [[function (mathematics)|map operation]] (by definition of a map).\n\nA continuous map <math>f:\\sigma\\rightarrow X</math> to a [[topological space]] ''X'' is frequently referred to as a '''singular ''n''-simplex'''.\n\n== Algebraic geometry ==\nSince classical algebraic geometry allows to talk about polynomial equations, but not inequalities, the ''algebraic standard n-simplex'' is commonly defined as the subset of affine n+1-dimensional space, where all coordinates sum up to 1 (thus leaving out the inequality part). The algebraic description of this set is\n\n:<math>\\Delta^n := \\{x \\in \\mathbb{A}^{n+1} \\vert \\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} x_i - 1 = 0\\}</math>,\n\nwhich equals the [[Scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]-theoretic description <math>\\Delta_n(R) = Spec(R[\\Delta^n])</math> with\n\n:<math>R[\\Delta^n] := R[x_1,...,x_{n+1}]/(\\sum x_i -1)</math>\n\nthe ring of regular functions on the algebraic n-simplex (for any ring <math>R</math>).\n\nBy using the same definitions as for the classical n-simplex, the n-simplices for different dimensions n assemble into one [[simplicial object]], while the rings <math>R[\\Delta^n]</math> assemble into one cosimplicial object <math>R[\\Delta^\\bullet]</math> (in the category of schemes resp. rings, since the face and degeneracy maps are all polynomial).\n\nThe algebraic n-simplices are used in higher [[K-Theory]] and in the definition of higher [[Chow groups]].\n\n== Applications ==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\nSimplices are used in plotting quantities that sum to 1, such as proportions of subpopulations, as in a [[ternary plot]].\n\nIn [[applied statistics#industrial|industrial statistics]], simplices arise in problem formulation and in algorithmic solution. In the design of bread, the producer must combine yeast, flour, water, sugar, etc. In such [[mixture]]s, only the relative proportions of ingredients matters: For an optimal bread mixture, if the flour is doubled then the yeast should be doubled. Such mixture problem are often formulated with normalized constraints, so that the nonnegative components sum to one, in which case the feasible region forms a simplex. The quality of the bread mixtures can be estimated using [[response surface methodology]], and then a local maximum can be computed using a [[nonlinear programming]] method, such as [[sequential quadratic programming]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n|author=Cornell, John\n|title=Experiments with Mixtures: Designs, Models, and the Analysis of Mixture Data\n|edition=third\n|publisher=Wiley\n|year=2002\n|isbn=0-471-07916-2\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn [[operations research]], [[linear programming]] problems can be solved by the [[simplex algorithm]] of [[George Dantzig]].\n\nIn [[geometric design]] and [[computer graphics]],  many methods first perform simplicial [[triangulation#simplicial|triangulation]]s of the domain and then  [[interpolation|fit interpolating]] [[polynomial and rational function modeling|polynomials]] to each simplex.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Vondran | first = Gary L. |date=April 1998 | title = Radial and Pruned Tetrahedral Interpolation Techniques | journal = HP Technical Report | volume = HPL-98-95 | pages = 1\u201332 | url = http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/98/HPL-98-95.pdf | format = PDF}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Complete graph]]\n* [[Causal dynamical triangulation]]\n* [[Distance geometry]]\n* [[Delaunay triangulation]]\n* [[Hill tetrahedron]]\n* Other regular n-[[polytope]]s\n** [[Hypercube]]\n** [[Cross-polytope]]\n** [[Tesseract]]\n* [[Hypersimplex]]\n* [[Polytope]]\n* [[Metcalfe's Law]]\n* [[List of regular polytopes]]\n* [[Schl\u00e4fli orthoscheme]]\n* [[Simplex algorithm]] - a method for solving optimisation problems with inequalities.\n* [[Simplicial complex]]\n* [[Simplicial homology]]\n* [[Simplicial set]]\n* [[Ternary plot]]\n* [[3-sphere]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n\n* [[Walter Rudin]], ''Principles of Mathematical Analysis (Third Edition)'', (1976)  McGraw-Hill, New York, ISBN 0-07-054235-X  ''(See chapter 10 for a simple review of topological properties.)''.\n* [[Andrew S.
