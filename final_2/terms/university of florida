About 10 are stationed in Geneva.  The group is the largest from any university in the U.S. to participate in the CMS experiment. The UF team designed and oversaw development of a major detector within the CMS. The detector, the Muon system, is intended to capture subatomic particles called muons, which are heavier cousins of electrons. Among other efforts, UF scientists analyzed about 100 of the 400 detector chambers placed within the Muon system to be sure they were functioning properly. Scientists from the University of Florida group played a central role in the discovery of the Higgs particle. The bulk of the UF research was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ufl.edu/2008/09/09/uf-collider/|title=09 \u00bb UF physicists to take part in world's most ambitious science experiment \u00bb University of Florida|author=University of Florida|publisher=|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Partnership with Zhejiang University====\nIn July 2008, the University of Florida teamed up with the [[Zhejiang University]] to research sustainable solutions to the Earth's energy issues.

The executive branch includes the student government president, vice president and treasurer elected by the student body during the spring semester, as well as nine agencies and forty-one cabinet members.\n\nThe Student Senate is the legislative branch, and is composed of 100 senators who serve one-year terms. The student body elects fifty senators during each spring semester and the remaining fifty during the fall semester. The senators elect a Senate President and Senate President Pro Tempore twice a year, after each semester's elections, to lead the Student Senate. During student government elections students may also vote on referendums, such as the renewable energy referendum,<ref name=\"Gators for a Sustainable Campus\">[http://sustainablegators.org/] June 5, 2009</ref> which was approved by 78% of voting students in the spring of 2007. This referendum proposed a fifty-cents-per-credit-hour increase to student activity fees to fund renewable energy and efficiency on campus.\n\nThe student government judicial branch has two major components: the Supreme Court of the Student Body (headed by a Chief Justice) and all elections related officials (the Supervisor of Elections and the Elections Commission). The Supreme Court consists of seven second or third-year law students nominated by the Student Body President and confirmed by the Student Senate. Each justice serves a \"life-time\" term, which extends through the individual justice's graduation and insulates the court from the politics of student government. The Chief Justice may appoint a marshal and clerk. The election commission is also composed of law students and it adjudicates all student government election complaints. The commission has six members, one of whom also serves as the commission chairman.\n\nThe student government executive branch is led by the Student Body President and includes the Student Body Vice President, Student Body Treasurer, twelve agencies, twelve executive secretaries, nineteen cabinet directors, and three cabinet chairs.\n\n===Alma mater===\n<!-- This image does not supplement the content of this section [[File:Dsg UF Lake Alice 20050507.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Lake Alice (Gainesville, Florida)|Lake Alice]]]] -->\n<!-- This image does not supplement the content of this section [[File:UFHistoricBuildingUstlerHall.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Women's Gymnasium (Gainesville, Florida)|Ustler Hall]]]] -->\nThe [[Alma mater (song)|alma mater]] for the University of Florida was composed by Milton Yeats in 1925.<ref>University of Florida, Gamedays: Songs & Traditions, [http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Fall06/Moye/songsandcheers1.html Alma Mater].
