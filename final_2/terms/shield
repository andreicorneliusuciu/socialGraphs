Shields also vary a great deal in thickness; whereas some shields were made of relatively deep, absorbent, wooden planking to protect soldiers from the impact of [[spear]]s and [[crossbow]] bolts, others were thinner and lighter and designed mainly for deflecting blade strikes.\n\nIn prehistory and during the era of the earliest civilizations, shields were made of wood, animal hide, woven reeds or [[wicker]]. In classical antiquity, the [[Barbarian Invasions]] and the [[Middle Ages]], they were normally constructed of poplar tree, lime or another split-resistant timber, covered in some instances with a material such as leather or rawhide and often reinforced with a metal boss, rim or banding. They were carried by foot soldiers, knights and cavalry.\n\nDepending on time and place, shields could be round, oval, square, rectangular, triangular, bilobal or scalloped. Sometimes they took on the form of kites or flatirons, or had rounded tops on a rectangular base with perhaps an eyehole, to look through when used with combat. The shield was held by a central grip or by straps that went over or around the user's arm.\n\nOften shields were decorated with a painted pattern or an animal representation to show their army or clan. These designs developed into systematized [[heraldic]] devices during the [[High Middle Ages]] for purposes of battlefield identification. Even after the introduction of gunpowder and firearms to the battlefield, shields continued to be used by certain groups. In the 18th century, for example, [[Scottish Highland]] fighters liked to wield small shields known as [[targe]]s, and as late as the 19th century, some non-industrialized peoples (such as [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] warriors) employed them when waging war.\n\nIn the 20th and 21st century, shields have been used by military and police units that specialize in anti-terrorist actions, hostage rescue, riot control and siege-breaking. The modern term usually refers to a device that is held in the hand or attached to the arm, as opposed to an armored suit or a [[bullet-proof vest]]. Shields are also sometimes mounted on vehicle-mounted weapons to protect the operator.\n\n== Prehistory and antiquity ==\n[[File:Greek soldiers of Greco\u2013Persian Wars.png|left|thumb|Greek soldiers of [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. Left: Greek [[Sling (weapon)|slinger]]. Right: [[hoplite]]s. Middle: hoplite's shield has a curtain which serves as a protection from arrows.]]\n\nThe oldest form of shield was a protection device designed to block attacks by [[hand weapon]]s, such as swords, axes and maces, or ranged weapons like sling-stones and arrows. Shields have varied greatly in construction over time and place. Sometimes shields were made of metal, but [[wood]] or [[Rawhide (textile)|animal hide]] construction was much more common; [[wicker]] and even turtle shells have been used. Many surviving examples of metal shields are generally felt to be ceremonial rather than practical, for example the [[Yetholm-type shields]] of the [[Bronze Age]], or the [[Iron Age]] [[Battersea Shield|Battersea shield]].\n\nSize and weight varied greatly. [[Light infantry|Lightly armored warriors]] relying on speed and surprise would generally carry light shields (''pelte'') that were either small or thin. [[Heavy infantry|Heavy troops]] might be equipped with robust shields that could cover most of the body. Many had a strap called a [[guige]] that allowed them to be slung over the user's back when not in use or on horseback. During the 14th\u201313th century&nbsp;BC, the [[Sherden|Sards or Shardana]], working as [[mercenaries]] for the Egyptian pharaoh [[Ramses II]], utilized either large or small round shields against the [[Hittites]]. The [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greeks]] used two types of shields: the \"figure-of-eight\" shield and a rectangular \"tower\" shield. These shields were made primarily from a wicker frame and then reinforced with leather. Covering the body from head to foot, the figure-of-eight and tower shield offered most of the warrior's body a good deal of protection in head-to-head combat. The Ancient Greek [[hoplites]] used a round, bowl-shaped wooden shield that was reinforced with bronze and called an ''[[aspis]]''. Another name for this type of shield is a ''hoplon''. The hoplon shield inspired the name for hoplite soldiers. The hoplon was also the longest-lasting and most famous and influential of all of the ancient Greek shields. The Spartans used the aspis to create the Greek phalanx formation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientmilitary.com/spartan-weapons.htm |title=Spartan Weapons |publisher=Ancientmilitary.com |date= |accessdate=9 April 2014}}</ref> Their shields offered protection not only for themselves but for their comrades to their left and right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientmilitary.com/spartan-military.htm |title=Spartan Military |publisher=Ancientmilitary.com |date= |accessdate=9 April 2014}}</ref> Examples of Germanic wooden shields circa 350&nbsp;BC&nbsp;\u2013 500&nbsp;AD survive from [[weapons sacrifice]]s in Danish bogs.\n\nThe heavily armored [[Roman legionaries]] carried large shields ([[scutum (shield)|''scuta'']]) that could provide far more protection, but made swift movement a little more difficult. The ''scutum'' originally had an oval shape, but gradually the curved tops and sides were cut to produce the familiar rectangular shape most commonly seen in the early Imperial legions. Famously, the Romans used their shields to create a tortoise-like formation called a [[testudo formation|''testudo'']] in which entire groups of soldiers would be enclosed in an armoured box to provide protection against missiles. Many ancient shield designs featured incuts of one sort or another. This was done to accommodate the shaft of a spear, thus facilitating tactics requiring the soldiers to stand close together forming a [[Shield wall|wall of shields]].\n\n== Middle Ages ==\n[[File:Thorsberg Shields.jpg|thumb|Two wooden round shields survived at [[Thorsberg moor]] (3rd century A.D.)]]\n\nTypical in the early European [[Middle Ages]] were [[Viking Age arms and armour#Round shields|round shields]] with light, non-splitting wood like [[Little-leaf Linden|linden]], [[fir]], [[alder]] or [[populus|poplar]], usually reinforced with [[leather]] cover on one or both sides and occasionally metal rims, encircling a metal [[shield boss]]. These light shields suited a fighting style where each incoming blow is intercepted with the boss in order to deflect it.\nThe Normans introduced the [[kite shield]] around the 10th century, which was rounded at the top and tapered at the bottom. This gave some protection to the user's legs, without adding too much to the total weight of the shield. \nThe kite shield predominantly features [[enarmes]], leather straps used to grip the shield tight to the arm. Used by foot and mounted troops alike, it gradually came to replace the round shield as the common choice until the end of the 12th century, when more efficient limb armour allowed the shields to grow shorter, and be entirely replaced by the 14th century.\n\nAs body armour improved, [[knight]]'s shields became smaller, leading to the familiar [[heater shield]] style. Both kite and heater style shields were made of several layers of laminated wood, with a gentle curve in cross section. The heater style inspired the shape of the symbolic [[heraldic shield]] that is still used today. Eventually, specialised shapes were developed such as the ''bouche'', which had a [[lance]] rest cut into the upper corner of the lance side, to help guide it in combat or tournament. Free standing shields called [[pavise]]s, which were propped up on stands, were used by medieval [[crossbow]]men who needed protection while reloading.\n\nIn time, some armoured foot knights gave up shields entirely in favour of mobility and two-handed weapons. Other knights and common soldiers adopted the [[buckler]], giving rise to the term \"[[swashbuckler]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hadesign.co.uk/SSA/html/buckler.htm |archive-date=2012-02-07 |title=The Sussex Rapier School |publisher=Hadesign.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2008-12-26}}</ref> The buckler is a small round shield, typically between 8 and 16&nbsp;inches (20\u201340&nbsp;cm) in diameter. The buckler was one of very few types of shield that were usually made of metal. Small and light, the buckler was easily carried by being hung from a belt; it gave little protection from missiles and was reserved for hand-to-hand combat where it served both for protection and offence. The buckler's use began in the [[Middle Ages]] and continued well into the 16th century.\n\nIn Italy, the [[targe|targa]], [[parma (shield)|parma]] and [[rotella (shield)|rotella]] were used by common people, fencers and even knights. The development of plate armour made shields less and less common as it eliminated the need for a shield.  Lightly armoured troops continued to use shields after [[men-at-arms]] and knights ceased to use them. Shields continued in use even after [[gunpowder]] powered weapons made them essentially obsolete on the battlefield. In the 18th century, the [[Scottish clans]] used a small, round targe that was partially effective against the firearms of the time,  although it was arguably more often used against British infantry bayonets and cavalry swords in close-in fighting.\n\nDuring the 19th century, non-industrial cultures with little access to guns were still using war shields. [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] warriors carried large lightweight shields called [[Ishlangu]] made from a single ox hide supported by a wooden spine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rrtraders.com/Shields/zuluw.htm |title=Zulu Shield (Longo) |publisher=Rrtraders.com |date= |accessdate=26 December 2008}}</ref>  This was used in combination with a short spear ([[assegai]]) and/or [[club (weapon)|club]].\n\n\n== Modern day shields ==\n\n=== Law enforcement shields ===\n[[File:Police Officer with balistic shield.JPG|thumb|A police officer utilizing a [[ballistic shield]] [[National Institute of Justice|NIJ]] Level IIIA]]\n[[File:U.S. Navy special warfare combatant-craft crewmen (SWCC), Special Boat Team 22 conducts training 16 AUG 09.jpg|thumb|[[U.S. Navy]] [[Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen]] (SWCC) fire a shield-equipped Minigun]]\n\nShields for protection from armed attack are still used by many [[police]] forces around the world. These modern shields are usually intended for two broadly distinct purposes. The first type, [[riot shield]]s, are used for [[riot control]] and can be made from [[metal]] or polymers such as polycarbonate [[Lexan]] or [[Makrolon]] or boPET [[Mylar]]. These typically offer protection from relatively large and low velocity projectiles, such as rocks and bottles, as well as blows from fists or clubs. Synthetic riot shields are normally transparent, allowing full use of the shield without obstructing vision. Similarly, metal riot shields often have a small window at eye level for this purpose. These riot shields are most commonly used to block and push back crowds when the users stand in a \"wall\" to block protesters, and to protect against [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]], [[projectiles]], [[molotov cocktails]], and during [[hand-to-hand combat]].\n\nThe second type of modern police shield is the bullet-resistant tactical shield. These shields are typically manufactured from advanced synthetics such as [[Kevlar]] and are designed to be [[bulletproof]], or at least [[bullet resistant]]. Two types of shields are available:\n\n# Light weight level IIIA shields that stop hand guns and submachine guns.\n# Heavy Level III and IV shields that stop rifle rounds.\n\nTactical shields often have a firing port so that the officer holding the shield can fire a weapon while being protected by the shield, and they often have a bulletproof glass viewing port. They are typically employed by specialist police, such as [[SWAT]] teams in high risk entry and siege scenarios, such as hostage rescue and breaching gang compounds, as well as in antiterrorism operations. Tactical shields often have a large signs stating \"POLICE\" (or the name of a force, such as \"US MARSHALS\") to indicate that the user is a law enforcement officer.\n\n=== Gun shields ===\n\nWith the widespread use of machine guns in [[World War I]] and in subsequent conflicts, battlegrounds were swept with automatic weapons fire. While soldiers who are in foxholes or trenches are protected from this fire, soldiers who are manning mounted machine guns were vulnerable to being hit. Since WW I, there have been a variety of attempts to install armored gun shields on tripod-mounted machine guns or vehicle-mounted weapons to protect machine gunners. Transportation devices with mounted guns that may have gun shields to protect the gunner include jeeps, Humvees, armored cars, and boats.\n\n=== Non-martial applications ===\n[[File:Dance Shield (Al Lan Nai), Native American, 03.325.3505.jpg|thumbnail|right|Dance shield (Al Lan Nai), Native American, [[Zuni people|Zuni]], [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n\nMany non-martial devices also employ shielding of a kind\u2014not usually a single device worn on an arm but various protective plates or other insulation positioned where needed. Space craft have heat shields to ensure a safe [[Atmospheric reentry|re-entry]]. [[Electronics]] uses shielding to reduce electrical noise and [[crosstalk]] between signals. Better-quality [[patch cables]] used in audio and electronic music have shielding to reduce interference and noise. People and systems that must work in the presence of [[ionizing radiation]] (X-rays) such as dentists, hospital technicians, and patients undergoing X-rays are protected with lead shielding clothing.\n\nEmblems that resemble heraldic shields are also called shields. Movie studio [[Warner Bros.]] uses a shield emblazoned with WB as its logo. The [[Looney Tunes]] [[cartoons]], released through Warner Bros., open with the WB shield zooming through concentric [[circle]]s. Also, the [[Superman logo]] uses a shield emblazoned with the letter ''S''.\n\n== Gallery ==\n{{cleanup gallery}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Tempio di Hatshepsut 001.JPG|Image from Hatshepsut's expedition to Punt showing Egyptians soldiers with shields (wood/animal skin). 15th century BC.
