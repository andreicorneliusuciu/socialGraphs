Because ramjets cannot produce thrust at zero airspeed, they cannot move an aircraft from a standstill. A ramjet-powered vehicle, therefore, requires an [[assisted take-off]] like a [[JATO|rocket assist]] to accelerate it to a speed where it begins to produce thrust. Ramjets work most efficiently at [[supersonic]] speeds around {{convert|3|Mach|lk=in}}.  This type of engine can operate up to speeds of {{convert|6|Mach|lk=in}}.\n\nRamjets can be particularly useful in applications requiring a small and simple mechanism for high-speed use, such as [[missile]]s. Weapon designers are looking to use ramjet technology in artillery shells to give added range; a 120&nbsp;mm mortar shell, if assisted by a ramjet, is thought to be able to attain a range of {{convert|22|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=flip}}.<ref name=\"ToV\">{{cite book |last=McNab |first1=Chris |last2=Keeter |first2=Hunter |url=https://books.google.dk/books/about/Tools_of_Violence.html?id=K7kxs__WNU8C |title=Tools of Violence: Guns, Tanks and Dirty Bombs |chapter=Death from a Distance Artillery |location=[[Oxford, United Kingdom]] |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |year=2008 |page=145 |isbn=978-1846032257 |accessdate=2016-02-12 }}</ref> They have also been used successfully, though not efficiently, as [[tip jet]]s on the end of [[helicopter]] rotors.<ref name=\"TIME 1965-11-26\">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,834721,00.html |title=Here Comes the Flying Stovepipe |work=[[TIME]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |date=1965-11-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408064246/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,834721,00.html |archivedate=2008-04-08 |accessdate=2008-04-08 }}</ref>\n\nRamjets differ from [[pulsejet]]s, which use an intermittent combustion; ramjets employ a continuous combustion process.\n\nAs speed increases, the efficiency of a ramjet starts to drop as the air temperature in the inlet increases due to compression. As the inlet temperature gets closer to the exhaust temperature, less energy can be extracted in the form of thrust. To produce a usable amount of thrust at yet higher speeds, the ramjet must be modified so that the incoming air is not compressed (and therefore heated) nearly as much. This means that the air flowing through the combustion chamber is still moving very fast (relative to the engine), in fact it will be supersonic - hence the name Supersonic Combustion Ramjet, or [[scramjet]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Cyrano de Bergerac===\n''L'Autre Monde: ou les \u00c9tats et Empires de la Lune ([[Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon]])'' was the first of three satirical novels written by [[Cyrano de Bergerac]], that are considered among the first [[science fiction]] stories.

The patent was finally granted in 1932 after four years of examination (German Patent No. 554,906, 1932-11-02).<ref>{{cite book | last = Dugger  | first = Gordon L.  | title = Ramjets  | publisher = [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]]  | year = 1969  | page = 15  | isbn = }}</ref>\n\n===Soviet Union===\nIn the Soviet Union, a theory of supersonic ramjet engines was presented in 1928 by [[Boris Stechkin]]. Yuri Pobedonostsev, chief of [[GIRD]]'s 3rd Brigade, carried out a great deal of research into ramjet engines. The first engine, the GIRD-04, was designed by I.A. Merkulov and tested in April 1933. To simulate supersonic flight, it was fed by air compressed to {{convert|200|atm|disp=flip}}, and was fueled with hydrogen.  The GIRD-08 phosphorus-fueled ramjet was tested by firing it from an artillery cannon.  These shells may have been the first jet-powered projectiles to break the speed of sound.\n\nIn 1939, Merkulov did further ramjet tests using a [[two-stage rocket]], the R-3.  In August of that year, he developed the first ramjet engine for use as an auxiliary motor of an aircraft, the DM-1.  The world's first ramjet-powered airplane flight took place in December 1939, using two DM-2 engines on a modified [[Polikarpov I-15]].  Merkulov designed a ramjet fighter \"Samolet D\" in 1941, which was never completed.  Two of his DM-4 engines were installed on the [[Yak-7]] PVRD fighter, during World War II.  In 1940, the Kostikov-302 experimental plane was designed, powered by a liquid fuel rocket for take-off and ramjet engines for flight.  That project was cancelled in 1944.\n\nIn 1947, [[Mstislav Keldysh]] proposed a [[Keldysh bomber|long-range antipodal bomber]], similar to the [[Silbervogel|S\u00e4nger-Bredt bomber]], but powered by ramjet instead of rocket.  In 1954, NPO Lavochkin and the Keldysh Institute began development of a trisonic ramjet-powered cruise missile, ''[[Burya]]''.  This project competed with the R-7 ICBM being developed by [[Sergei Korolev]], and was cancelled in 1957.\n\n===Germany===\nIn 1936, [[Hellmuth Walter]] constructed a test engine powered by [[natural gas]]. Theoretical work was carried out at [[BMW]] and [[Junkers]], as well as [[Deutsche Forschungsanstalt f\u00fcr Luftfahrt|DFL]]. In 1941, [[Eugen S\u00e4nger]] of DFL proposed a ramjet engine with a very high combustion chamber temperature. He constructed very large ramjet pipes with {{convert|500|mm|in}} and {{convert|1000|mm|in}} diameter and carried out combustion tests on lorries and on a special test rig on a [[Dornier Do 17]]Z at flight speeds of up to {{convert|200|m/s|km/h}}. Later, with petrol becoming scarce in Germany due to wartime conditions, tests were carried out with blocks of pressed coal dust as a fuel, which were not successful due to slow combustion.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hirschel | first = Ernst-Heinrich | authorlink = |author2=Horst Prem |author3=Gero Madelung  | title = Aeronautical Research in Germany | publisher = Springer | year = 2004 | location = | pages = 242\u2013243 | url = | dpi =  | isbn = 3-540-40645-X}}</ref>\n\n===Gorgon IV===\n[[File:GorgonIV on BlackWidow.png|thumb|The Gorgon IV mounted on the wing of a [[P-61 Black Widow]] in preparation for flight testing]]\n\nThe US Navy developed a series of air-to-air missiles under the name of \"[[Gorgon (U.S. missile)|Gorgon]]\" using different propulsion mechanisms, including ramjet propulsion. The ramjet Gorgon IVs, made by [[Glenn L. Martin|Glenn Martin]], were tested in 1948 and 1949 at [[Naval Air Station Point Mugu]]. The ramjet engine itself was designed at the University of Southern California and manufactured by the [[Marquardt Corporation|Marquardt Aircraft Company]]. The engine was {{convert|7|ft|disp=flip}} long and {{convert|20|in|disp=flip}} in diameter and was positioned below the missile (see photo).\n\n===Fritz Zwicky===\nEminent Swiss astrophysicist [[Fritz Zwicky]] was research director at [[Aerojet]] and holds many patents in jet propulsion. U.S. patents 5121670 and 4722261 are for [[ram accelerator]]s. The U.S. Navy would not allow Fritz Zwicky to publicly discuss his own invention, U.S. Patent 2,461,797 for the Underwater Jet, a ram jet that performs in a fluid medium.  ''Time'' chronicles Fritz Zwicky's work in the \"Missed Swiss\", July 11, 1955, and the \"Underwater Jet\" in the March 14, 1949 issue.\n\n===France===\n[[File:Leduc 022.JPG|thumb|left|Leduc 022]]\n\nIn France, the works of [[Ren\u00e9 Leduc]] were notable. Leduc's Model, the [[Leduc 0.10]] was one of the first ramjet-powered aircraft to fly, in 1949.\n\nThe [[Nord 1500 Griffon]] reached {{convert|2.19|Mach|m/s km/h}} in 1958.\n\n==Engine cycle==\n[[File:Brayton cycle.svg|thumb|Brayton cycle]]\n{{main|Brayton cycle}}\nThe '''Brayton cycle''' is a [[thermodynamic cycle]] that describes the workings of the [[gas turbine]] engine, the basis of the [[airbreathing jet engine]] and others. It is named after [[George Brayton]] (1830\u20131892), the American [[engineer]] who developed it, although it was originally proposed  and patented by Englishman [[John Barber (engineer)|John Barber]] in 1791.<ref>according to [http://www.turbomachine.com/history/ Gas Turbine History].</ref> It is also sometimes known as the '''[[James Prescott Joule|Joule]] cycle'''.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Ramjet P280b.jpg|thumb|A typical ramjet]]\nA ramjet is designed around its inlet. An object moving at high speed through air generates a high pressure region upstream.  A ramjet uses this high pressure in front of the engine to force air through the tube, where it is heated by combusting some of it with fuel.  It is then passed through a nozzle to accelerate it to supersonic speeds. This acceleration gives the ramjet forward [[thrust]].\n\nA ramjet is sometimes referred to as a 'flying stovepipe', a very simple device comprising an air intake, a combustor, and a [[nozzle]]. Normally, the only moving parts are those within the [[turbopump]], which pumps the fuel to the combustor in a liquid-fuel ramjet. Solid-fuel ramjets are even simpler.\n\nBy way of comparison, a [[turbojet]] uses a gas turbine-driven [[Gas compressor|fan]] to compress the air further. This gives greater compression and efficiency and far more power at low speeds, where the ram effect is weak, but is also more complex, heavier and expensive, and the temperature limits of the [[turbine]] section limit the top speed and thrust at high speed.\n\n===Diffuser===\nRamjets try to exploit the very high [[dynamic pressure]] within the air approaching the intake lip. An efficient intake will recover much of the freestream [[stagnation pressure]], which is used to support the combustion and expansion process in the nozzle.\n\nMost ramjets operate at [[supersonic]] flight speeds and use one or more [[cone (geometry)|conical]] (or oblique) [[shock wave]]s, terminated by a strong normal shock, to slow down the airflow to a subsonic velocity at the exit of the intake. Further diffusion is then required to get the air velocity down to a suitable level for the combustor.\n\n[[File:Pitotintake.svg|thumb|Subsonic intakes on ramjets are relatively simple.]]\nSubsonic ramjets do not need such a sophisticated inlet since the airflow is already subsonic and a simple hole is usually used. This would also work at slightly supersonic speeds, but as the air will choke at the inlet, this is inefficient.\n\nThe inlet is divergent, to provide a constant inlet speed of {{convert|0.5|Mach|m/s km/h}}.\n\n===Combustor===\nAs with other jet engines, the combustor's job is to create hot air, by burning a fuel with the air at essentially constant pressure. The airflow through the jet engine is usually quite high, so sheltered combustion zones are produced by using '[[flame holder]]s' to stop the flames from blowing out.\n\nSince there is no downstream turbine, a ramjet combustor can safely operate at [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] fuel:air ratios, which implies a combustor exit [[stagnation temperature]] of the order of {{convert|2400|K}} for kerosene. Normally, the combustor must be capable of operating over a wide range of throttle settings, for a range of flight speeds/altitudes. Usually, a sheltered pilot region enables combustion to continue when the vehicle intake undergoes high [[Flight dynamics|yaw/pitch]] during turns. Other flame stabilization techniques make use of flame holders, which vary in design from combustor cans to simple flat plates, to shelter the flame and improve fuel mixing.  Overfuelling the combustor can cause the normal shock within a supersonic intake system to be pushed forward beyond the intake lip, resulting in a substantial drop in engine airflow and net thrust.\n\n===Nozzles===\nThe [[propelling nozzle]] is a critical part of a ramjet design, since it accelerates exhaust flow to produce thrust.\n\nFor a ramjet operating at a subsonic flight Mach number, exhaust flow is accelerated through a converging [[nozzle]]. For a supersonic flight Mach number, acceleration is typically achieved via a [[De Laval nozzle|convergent-divergent nozzle]].\n\n[[File:Bloodhound thor arp 750pix.jpg|thumb|One of the two [[Bristol Thor]] ramjet engines on a [[Bristol Bloodhound]] missile]]\n\n===Performance and control===\nAlthough ramjets have been run as slow as {{convert|45|m/s|km/h}},<ref name=\"primer\">[http://www.alt-accel.com/ramjet2.htm RAMJET PRIMER].</ref> below about {{convert|0.5|Mach|m/s km/h}} they give little thrust and are highly inefficient due to their low pressure ratios.\n\nAbove this speed, given sufficient initial flight velocity, a ramjet will be self-sustaining. Indeed, unless the vehicle [[Drag (physics)|drag]] is extremely high, the engine/airframe combination will tend to accelerate to higher and higher flight speeds, substantially increasing the air intake temperature. As this could have a detrimental effect on the integrity of the engine and/or airframe, the fuel control system must reduce engine fuel flow to stabilize the flight [[Mach number]] and, thereby, air intake temperature to reasonable levels.\n\nDue to the stoichiometric combustion temperature, efficiency is usually good at high speeds (around {{convert|2|-|3|Mach|m/s km/h|disp=sqbr}}), whereas at low speeds the relatively poor pressure ratio means the ramjets are outperformed by [[turbojets]], or even [[rocket]]s.\n\n== Types ==\nRamjets can be classified according to the type of fuel, liquid or solid; and the booster.<ref>\"A Century of Ramjet Propulsion Technology Evolution\", AIAA Journal of Propulsion and Power, Vol. 20, No. 1, January \u2013 February 2004.</ref>\n\nIn a liquid fuel ramjet (LFRJ), hydrocarbon fuel (typically) is injected into the combustor ahead of a flameholder which stabilises the flame resulting from the combustion of the fuel with the compressed air from the intake(s). A means of pressurizing and supplying the fuel to the ramcombustor is required, which can be complicated and expensive. [[A\u00e9rospatiale|A\u00e9rospatiale-Celerg]] designed an LFRJ where the fuel is forced into the injectors by an elastomer bladder which inflates progressively along the length of the fuel tank. Initially, the bladder forms a close-fitting sheath around the compressed air bottle from which it is inflated, which is mounted lengthwise in the tank.<ref>\"A\u00e9rospatiale studies low-cost ramjet\", Flight International, 13\u201319 December 1995.</ref> This offers a lower-cost approach than a regulated LFRJ requiring a turbopump and associated hardware to supply the fuel.<ref>\"Hughes homes in on missile pact\", Flight International, 11\u201317 September 1996.</ref>\n\nA ramjet generates no static thrust and needs a booster to achieve a forward velocity high enough for efficient operation of the intake system. The first ramjet-powered missiles used external boosters, usually solid-propellant rockets, either in tandem, where the booster is mounted immediately aft of the ramjet, e.g. [[Sea Dart missile|Sea Dart]], or wraparound where multiple boosters are attached alongside the outside of the ramjet, e.g. [[SA-4 Ganef]]. The choice of booster arrangement is usually driven by the size of the launch platform. A tandem booster increases the overall length of the system, whereas wraparound boosters increase the overall diameter. Wraparound boosters will usually generate higher drag than a tandem arrangement.\n\nIntegrated boosters provide a more efficient packaging option, since the booster propellant is cast inside the otherwise empty combustor. This approach has been used on solid, for example [[SA-6 Gainful]], liquid, for example [[Air-Sol Moyenne Port\u00e9e|ASMP]], and ducted rocket, for example [[MBDA Meteor|Meteor]], designs. Integrated designs are complicated by the different nozzle requirements of the boost and ramjet phases of flight. Due to the higher thrust levels of the booster, a differently shaped nozzle is required for optimum thrust compared to that required for the lower thrust ramjet sustainer. This is usually achieved via a separate nozzle, which is ejected after booster burnout. However, designs such as Meteor feature nozzleless boosters. This offers the advantages of elimination of the hazard to launch aircraft from the ejected boost nozzle debris, simplicity, reliability, and reduced mass and cost,<ref>Procinsky, I.M., McHale, C.A., \"Nozzleless Boosters for Integral-Rocket-Ramjet Missile Systems, Paper 80-1277, AIAA/SAE/ASME 16th Joint Propulsion Conference, 30 June to 2 July 1980.</ref> although this must be traded against the reduction in performance compared with that provided by a dedicated booster nozzle.\n\n==Integral rocket ramjet/ducted rocket==\n{{Main|Air-augmented rocket}}\n\nA slight variation on the ramjet uses the supersonic exhaust from a rocket combustion process to compress and react with the incoming air in the main combustion chamber. This has the advantage of giving thrust even at zero speed.\n\nIn a solid fuel integrated rocket ramjet (SFIRR), the solid fuel is cast along the outer wall of the ramcombustor. In this case, fuel injection is through ablation of the propellant by the hot compressed air from the intake(s). An aft mixer may be used to improve combustion efficiency. SFIRRs are preferred over LFRJs for some applications because of the simplicity of the fuel supply, but only when the throttling requirements are minimal, i.e. when variations in altitude or Mach number are limited.\n\nIn a ducted rocket, a solid fuel gas generator produces a hot fuel-rich gas which is burnt in the ramcombustor with the compressed air supplied by the intake(s). The flow of gas improves the mixing of the fuel and air and increases total pressure recovery. In a throttleable ducted rocket, also known as a variable flow ducted rocket, a valve allows the gas generator exhaust to be throttled allowing control of the thrust. Unlike an LFRJ, solid propellant ramjets cannot [[flame out]]. The ducted rocket sits somewhere between the simplicity of the SFRJ and the unlimited throttleability of the LFRJ.\n\n== Flight speed ==\nRamjets generally give little or no thrust below about half the [[speed of sound]], and they are inefficient (less than 600 [[Specific Impulse|seconds]]) until the airspeed exceeds {{convert|1000|km/h|m/s mph}} due to low compression ratios. Even above the minimum speed, a wide [[flight envelope]] (range of flight conditions), such as low to high speeds and low to high altitudes, can force significant design compromises, and they tend to work best optimised for one designed speed and altitude (point designs). However, ramjets generally outperform gas turbine-based jet engine designs and work best at supersonic speeds (Mach 2\u20134).<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/SPRING/propulsion/notes/node85.html#SECTION06363300000000000000 11.6 Performance of Jet Engines<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref> Although inefficient at slower speeds, they are more fuel-efficient than rockets over their entire useful working range up to at least {{convert|6|Mach|m/s km/h}}.\n\nThe performance of conventional ramjets falls off above Mach 6 due to dissociation and pressure loss caused by shock as the incoming air is slowed to subsonic velocities for combustion. In addition, the combustion chamber's inlet temperature increases to very high values, approaching the dissociation limit at some limiting Mach number.\n\n== Related engines ==\n\n===Air turboramjet===\n{{Main|Air turboramjet}}\nAnother example of this is the air turboramjet, which has a compressor powered by a gas heated via a heat exchanger within the combustion chamber.\n\n===Scramjets===\n{{Main|Scramjet}}\nRamjets always slow the incoming air to a subsonic velocity within the combustor. [[Scramjet]]s, or \"supersonic combustion ramjet\" are similar to ramjets, but some of the air goes through the entire engine at supersonic speeds. This increases the stagnation pressure recovered from the freestream and improves net thrust. Thermal choking of the exhaust is avoided  by having a relatively high supersonic air velocity at combustor entry. Fuel injection is often into a sheltered region below a step in the combustor wall. Although scramjet engines have been studied for many decades, only recently have small experimental units been flight tested and then only very briefly (e.g. the [[Boeing X-43]]).<ref>[http://www.boeing.com/history/chronology/chron17.html \"Boeing: History \u2013 Chronology 2002\u20132004\"].</ref>\n\nAs of May, 2010, this engine has been tested to attain {{convert|5|Mach|m/s km/h}} for 200 seconds on the [[X-51A Waverider]].<ref>[http://www.wpafb.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123206524 \"USAF vehicle breaks record for hypersonic flight\"].</ref>\n\n===Precooled engines===\n{{Main|Precooled jet engine}}\nA variant of the pure ramjet is the 'combined cycle' engine, intended to overcome the limitations of the pure ramjet. One example of this is the [[Reaction Engines SABRE|SABRE]] engine; this uses a precooler, behind which is the ramjet and turbine machinery.\n\nThe [[ATREX]] engine developed in Japan is an experimental implementation of this concept. It uses [[liquid hydrogen]] fuel in a fairly exotic, single-fan arrangement.  The liquid hydrogen fuel is pumped through a [[heat exchanger]] in the air intake, simultaneously heating the liquid hydrogen, and cooling the incoming air. This cooling of the incoming air is critical to achieving a reasonable efficiency. The hydrogen then continues through a second heat exchanger position after the combustion section, where the hot exhaust is used to further heat the hydrogen, turning it into a very high pressure gas. This gas is then passed through the tips of the fan to provide driving power to the fan at subsonic speeds. After mixing with the air, it is burned in the combustion chamber.\n\nThe [[Reaction Engines Scimitar]] has been proposed for the [[LAPCAT]] hypersonic airliner, and the [[Reaction Engines SABRE]] for the [[Reaction Engines Skylon]] spaceplane.\n\n===Nuclear-powered ramjets===\n{{Main|Project Pluto}}\nDuring the [[Cold War]], the United States designed and ground-tested a nuclear-powered ramjet called [[Project Pluto]].  This system used no combustion; a [[nuclear reactor]] heated the air instead.  The project was ultimately canceled because [[ICBM]]s seemed to serve the purpose better, and because a low-flying [[radioactivity|radioactive]] missile could cause problems for any allied soldiers.\n\n===Ionospheric ramjet===\nThe upper atmosphere above about {{convert|100|km}} contains [[monatomic]] oxygen produced by the sun through photochemistry.
