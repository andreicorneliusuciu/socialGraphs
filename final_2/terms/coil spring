They are made of an [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] material formed into the shape of a [[helix]] which returns to its natural length when unloaded.\n\nUnder tension or compression, the material (wire) of a coil spring undergoes torsion.  The spring characteristics therefore depend on the [[shear modulus]], not [[Young's Modulus]].\n\nA coil spring may also be used as a [[torsion spring]]: in this case the spring as a whole is subjected to torsion about its helical axis.  The material of the [[Spring (device)|spring]] is thereby subjected to a [[bending moment]], either reducing or increasing the helical radius.  In this mode, it is the [[Young's Modulus]] of the material that determines the spring characteristics.\n\nMetal coil springs are made by winding a wire around a shaped former - a cylinder is used to form cylindrical coil springs.\n\n== Variants ==\n[[File:Sherman chen.jpg|thumb|[[Volute spring]] suspension on an [[M4 Sherman]] tank]]\nTypes of coil spring are:\n\n* Tension/extension coil springs, designed to resist stretching.  They usually have a hook or eye form at each end for attachment.\n* Compression coil springs, designed to resist being compressed.  A typical use for compression coil springs is in [[car]] [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension systems]].\n** [[Volute spring]]s are used as heavy load compression springs. A strip of plate is rolled into the shape of both a helix and a spiral. When compressed, the strip is stiffer edge-on than a wire coil, but the spiral arrangement allows the turns to overlap rather than bottoming out on each other.\n* Torsion springs, designed to resist twisting actions. Often associated to clothes pegs or up-and-over garage doors.\n\n== Applications ==\nCoil springs have many applications; notable ones include:\n* [[Buckling spring]]s in [[computer keyboard]]s\n* [[Mattress coil]]s in [[innerspring mattress]]es\n* [[Upholstery coil springs]] in [[upholstery]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Timmis system]], an early form of coil spring used on railway axles.\n* [[Spring (device)]]\n\n== External links ==\n\n* ''[http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/HelicalSpring/ Helical Spring]'' by S\u00e1ndor Kabai at [[The Wolfram Demonstrations Project]].\n* [http://www.mcallisterind.com/technical-info.html glossary] by manufacturer McAllister Industries.\n* [http://www.ist.org.uk Institute of Spring Technology]\n* [http://www.smihq.org Spring Manufacturers Institute]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130918155928/http://home.earthlink.net/~bazillion/intro.html], tutorial by Dave Silberstein.\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=eSQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA2-PA159&dq=popular+science+1949+%22One+Engine+Keeps+It+Flying%22&hl=en&ei=yfTgTOvnHND8ngepy4D6Dw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=true '' \"You Spring From Morning To Night\" '', April 1949, Popular Science] article on the basics of steel coil springs manufacturing.\nhttp://suspensionspot.com/springs/\n\n[[Category:Automotive suspension technologies|Coil spring]]\n[[Category:Springs (mechanical)|Coil spring]]\n\n[[de:Feder (Technik)#Schraubenfeder]]\n\n\n{{design-stub}}"}]}}}}
