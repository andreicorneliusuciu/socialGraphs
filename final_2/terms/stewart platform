Devices placed on the top plate can be moved in the six [[Degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]] in which it is possible for a freely-suspended body to move.  These are the three linear movements x, y, z (lateral, longitudinal and vertical), and the three rotations [[Roll, pitch, and yaw|pitch, roll, & yaw]].  The terms \"six-axis\" or \"6-DoF\" (Degrees of Freedom) platform are also used, also \"synergistic\" (see below).\n\n==Name of the device==\n[[Image:Hexapod positioner aka Stewart platform x2.jpg|thumb|Two hexapod positioners]]\n\n===Designed by Gough and Stewart===\nThis specialised six-jack layout was first used by V E (Eric) Gough of the [[UK]] and was operational in 1954,<ref name=\"Gough, 1956\" >{{Cite journal \n  |last=Gough  |first=V.

To be more precise, the original Stewart platform had a slightly different design.<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Lazard | first1 = D. | last2 = Merlet | first2 = J. -P. | doi = 10.1109/ROBOT.1994.350969 | chapter = The (true) Stewart platform has 12 configurations | title = Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation | pages = 2160 | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-8186-5330-2 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> See the more detailed references at the end of this article.\n\n===Synergistic===\nBecause the motions are produced by a combination of movements of several of the jacks, such a device is sometimes called a ''synergistic motion platform'', due to the synergy (mutual interaction) between the way that the jacks are programmed.\n\n===Hexapod===\nBecause the device has six jacks, it is often also known as a ''hexapod'' (six legs).  The [[trademark]]ed name \"hexapod\" (by Geodetic Technology)<ref>Parallel Robots - Second Edition by J.P. Merlet (pp. 48)</ref> was originally for Stewart platforms used in [[machine tool]]s. However, the term is now used for 6-jack platforms outside of the machine tool area, since it simply means \"six legs\".<ref>[http://www.fraunhofer.de/fhg/archiv/magazin/pflege.zv.fhg.de/english/publications/df/df2001/magazine2_2001_46.pdf Fraunhofer Research: Hexapod Robot for Spine Surgery]</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\nStewart platforms have applications in flight simulators, machine tool technology, crane technology, underwater research, air-to-sea rescue, [[mechanical bull]]s, satellite dish positioning, [[Hexapod-Telescope|telescopes]] and orthopedic surgery.\n\n===Flight simulation===\n[[Image:Simulator-flight-compartment.jpeg|thumb|right|A Stewart Platform in use by Lufthansa]]\n\nThe Stewart platform design is extensively used in [[flight simulation]], particularly in the so-called [[full flight simulator]] for which all 6 degrees of freedom are required. This application was developed by [[Thales Training & Simulation|Redifon]], whose simulators featuring it became available for the Boeing 707, Douglas DC-8, [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]], [[Canadair CL-44]], [[Boeing 727]], Comet, [[Vickers Viscount]], [[Vickers Vanguard]],\n[[Convair 990 Coronado|Convair CV 990]], [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]], [[Vickers VC10]], and [[Fokker F27 Friendship|Fokker F-27]] by 1962.<ref>http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1962/1962%20-%201616.html</ref>\n\nIn  this role, the payload is a replica cockpit and a visual display system, normally of several channels, for showing the outside-world visual scene to the aircraft crew that are being trained.  Payload weights in the case of a full flight simulator for a large transport aircraft can be up to about 15,000 kilogrammes.\n\nSimilar platforms are used in [[driving simulators]], typically mounted on large [[x-y tables]] to simulate short term acceleration.  Long term acceleration can be simulated by tilting the platform, and an active research area is how to mix the two.\n\n===RoboCrane===\n[[James S. Albus]] of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] ([[NIST]]) developed the [[robocrane|RoboCrane]], where the platform hangs from six cables instead of being supported by six jacks.\n\n[[Image:gough-platform.jpg|thumb|right|Eric Gough's Tire Testing Machine, which is a Stewart Platform with large jacks]]\n\n===LIDS===\nThe [[Low impact docking system]] developed by NASA uses a Stewart platform to manipulate space vehicles during the docking process.\n\n===CAREN===\nThe Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment developed by Motek Medical uses a Stewart platform coupled with virtual reality to do advanced biomechanical and clinical research.<ref>http://www.motekforcelink.com/caren</ref>\n\n===Taylor Spatial Frame===\nDr. J. Charles Taylor utilized the Stewart platform to develop the [[Taylor Spatial Frame]],<ref>http://www.jcharlestaylor.com</ref> an [[external fixator]] used in [[orthopedic surgery]] for the correction of bone deformities and treatment of complex fractures.\n\n=== Eric Gough - inventor of the 6-axis jack layout ===\nEric Gough was an automotive engineer and worked at [[Fort Dunlop]], the [[Dunlop Tyres]] factory in [[Birmingham]], England.<ref>{{Cite book\n  |title=The History of the Pneumatic Tyre\n  |last=Tompkins\n  |first=Eric\n  |year=1981\n  |publisher=Dunlop\n  |isbn=0-903214-14-8\n  |pages=86, 91\n}}</ref> He developed his \"Universal Tyre-Testing Machine\" (also called the \"Universal Rig\") in the 1950s and his platform was operational by 1954.<ref name=\"Gough, 1956\" /> The rig was able to mechanically test tyres under combined loads. Dr. Gough died in 1972 but his testing rig continued to be used up until the late 1980s when the factory was closed down and then demolished. His rig was saved and transported to the [[Science Museum (London)]] storage facility at Wroughton near Swindon.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Parallel manipulator]]\n* [[Robot kinematics]]\n* [[Acceleration onset cueing]]\n* [[Linear actuator]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bonev, I.A., \"[http://www.parallemic.org/Reviews/Review007.html The True Origins of Parallel Robots]\", ParalleMIC online review\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Hexapods}}\n*[http://www.mel.nist.gov/photos/photo/phexa99.html Pictures of the NIST/Ingersoll prototype octahedral hexapod]\n*[http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/rellis/courses/ME250/ME250pres/hexapod_Shirke.ppt Hexapod Structures for Surgery]\n*[http://www.hexapods.net/pdf/Hexapod_In_Astronomy_Paper.pdf Hexapod for Astronomy]\n\n[[Category:Robot kinematics]]\n[[Category:Machines]]\n[[Category:1954 in robotics]]\n[[Category:Parallel robots]]"}]}}}}
