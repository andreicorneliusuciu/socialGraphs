Reisinger). November 1999, Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., New York, ISBN 0-387-98656-1.</ref> The constituents that compose granular material must be large enough such that they are not subject to thermal motion fluctuations. Thus, the lower size limit for grains in granular material is about 1 [[Micrometre|\u00b5m]]. On the upper size limit, the physics of granular materials may be applied to ice floes where the individual grains are [[iceberg]]s and to [[asteroid belt]]s of the [[Solar System]] with individual grains being [[asteroid]]s.\n\nSome examples of granular materials are [[snow]], [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[coal]], [[sand]], [[rice]], [[coffee]], [[corn flakes]], [[fertilizer]] and [[ball bearing]]s. [[Powder (substance)|Powders]] are a special class of granular material due to their small particle size, which makes them more [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesive]] and more easily [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] in a [[gas]]. Granular materials are commercially important in applications as diverse as [[pharmaceutical]] industry, [[agriculture]], and [[energy production]]. Research into granular materials is thus directly applicable and goes back at least to [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]], whose [[Friction|law of friction]] was originally stated for granular materials.<ref>Rodhes, M (editor), ''Principles of powder technology'', John Wiley & Sons, 1997 ISBN 0-471-92422-9</ref>\n\nThe [[soldier]]/[[physicist]] Brigadier [[Ralph Alger Bagnold]] was an early pioneer of the physics of granular matter and whose book ''[[The Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes]]''<ref>Bagnold, R.A. 1941. ''The physics of blown sand and desert dunes''. London: Methuen,</ref> remains an important reference to this day.\n\nAccording to [[material science|material scientist]] Patrick Richard, \"Granular materials are ubiquitous in [[nature]] and are the second-most manipulated material in industry (the first one is [[water]])\".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Richard, P.|title= Slow relaxation and compaction of granular systems|doi=10.1038/nmat1300|year=2005|last2=Nicodemi|first2=Mario|last3=Delannay|first3=Renaud|last4=Ribi\u00e8re|first4=Philippe|last5=Bideau|first5=Daniel|journal=Nature Materials|volume=4|issue=2|pages=121\u20138|pmid=15689950|bibcode = 2005NatMa...4..121R }}</ref>\n\nIn some sense, granular materials do not constitute a single [[phases of matter|phase of matter]] but have characteristics reminiscent of [[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s, or [[gas]]es depending on the average energy per grain. However, in each of these states granular materials also exhibit properties which are unique.\n\nGranular materials also exhibit a wide range of pattern forming behaviors when excited (e.g. vibrated or allowed to flow). As such granular materials under excitation can be thought of as an example of a [[complex system]].\n\n== Granular solids ==\n{{Main|Force chain}}\n[[File:Stress transmision.svg|thumb|right|150px|Chain of transmission of stress forces in a granular media]]\nWhen the average energy of the individual grains is low and the grains are fairly stationary relative to each other, the granular material acts like a solid. In general, stress in a granular solid is not distributed uniformly but is conducted away along so-called [[force chain]]s which are networks of grains resting on one another. Between these chains are regions of low stress whose grains are shielded for the effects of the grains above by [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]] and [[arch]]ing.\n\n== Granular gases ==\nIf the granular material is driven harder such that contacts between the grains become highly infrequent, the material enters a gaseous state.  Correspondingly, one can define a granular temperature equal to the root mean square of grain velocity fluctuations that is analogous to [[thermodynamic temperature]].\nUnlike conventional gases, granular materials will tend to cluster and clump due to the [dissipative] nature of the collisions between grains. This clustering has some interesting consequences. For example, if a partially partitioned box of granular materials is vigorously shaken then grains will over time tend to collect in one of the partitions rather than spread evenly into both partitions as would happen in a conventional gas. This effect, known as the granular [[Maxwell's demon]], does not violate any thermodynamics principles since energy is constantly being lost from the system in the process.\n\n== Jamming transition ==\n[[File:Granular jamming.svg|thumb|right|150px|Jamming during discharge of granular material is due to arch formation (red spheres)]]\nGranular systems are known to exhibit [[Jamming (physics)|jamming]] and undergo a jamming transition which is thought of as a thermodynamic phase transition to a jammed state.<ref>Haye Hinrichsen, Dietrich E. Wolf (eds), ''The Physics of Granular Media''. 2004, Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. ISBN 978-3-527-60362-6</ref>\nThe [[Lubachevsky-Stillinger algorithm]] of jamming allows one to produce simulated jammed granular configurations.\n<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://cherrypit.princeton.edu/papers/paper-202.pdf|doi=10.1063/1.1511510|title= Computer Generation of Dense Polydisperse Sphere Packings|year=2002|last1=Kansal|first1=Anuraag R.|last2=Torquato|first2=Salvatore|last3=Stillinger|first3=Frank H.|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|volume=117|issue=18|pages=8212|bibcode = 2002JChPh.117.8212K }}</ref>\n\n== Pattern formation ==\nExcited granular matter is a rich pattern-forming system.  Some of the pattern-forming behaviours seen in granular materials are:\n* The un-mixing or segregation of unlike grains under vibration and flow. An example of this is the so-called [[Brazil nut effect]] where Brazil nuts rise to the top of a packet of mixed nuts when shaken.The cause of this effect is that when shaken, granular (and some other) materials move in a circular pattern. some larger materials (Brazil nuts) get stuck while going down the circle and therefore stay on the top.\n* The formation of surface patterns in vibrated granular layers.  These patterns include but are not limited to stripes, squares and hexagons.  These patterns are thought to be composed of fundamental excitations of the surface known as [[oscillon]]s.\n* The formation of sand [[ripple marks|ripples]], [[dune]]s, and [[sandsheet]]s\n[[File:Flickr - Argenberg - Sand dunes (2007-05-226).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sand dunes]]\nSome of the pattern-forming behaviours have been possible to reproduce in computer simulations.\n<ref>John J.

Some desert dunes are known to exhibit [[booming dunes|booming]] during avalanching or when their surface is otherwise disturbed.
