[[Wernher von Braun]] is at center.]]\n{{Main article|List of NASA missions}}\n\nNASA has conducted many manned and unmanned spaceflight programs throughout its history. Unmanned programs launched the first American artificial [[satellite]]s into Earth orbit for scientific and [[communications satellite|communications]] purposes, and sent scientific probes to explore the planets of the solar system, starting with [[Venus]] and [[Mars]], and including \"[[Voyager program|grand tours]]\" of the outer planets. Manned programs sent the first Americans into [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO), won the [[Space Race]] with the [[Soviet Union]] by landing twelve men on the Moon from 1969 to 1972 in the [[Apollo program]], developed a semi-reusable LEO [[Space Shuttle]], and developed LEO [[space station]] capability by itself and with the cooperation of several other nations including post-Soviet [[Russia]]. Some missions include both manned and unmanned aspects, such as the Galileo probe, which was deployed by astronauts in Earth orbit before being sent unmanned to Jupiter.\n\n===Manned programs===\nThe experimental [[rocket-powered aircraft]] programs started by NACA were extended by NASA as support for manned spaceflight. This was followed by a one-man [[space capsule]] program, and in turn by a two-man capsule program. Reacting to loss of national prestige and [[national security|security]] fears caused by early leads in space exploration by the [[Soviet Union]], in 1961 President [[John F. Kennedy]] proposed the ambitious goal \"of landing a man on the Moon by the end of [the 1960s], and returning him safely to the Earth.\" This goal was met in 1969 by the [[Apollo program]], and NASA planned even more ambitious activities leading to a [[manned mission to Mars]]. However, reduction of the perceived threat and changing political priorities almost immediately caused the termination of most of these plans. NASA turned its attention to an Apollo-derived temporary space laboratory, and a semi-reusable Earth orbital shuttle. In the 1990s, funding was approved for NASA to develop a permanent Earth orbital [[space station]] in cooperation with the international community, which now included the former rival, post-Soviet [[Russia]]. To date, NASA has launched a total of 166 manned space missions on rockets, and thirteen [[X-15]] rocket flights above the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] definition of spaceflight altitude, {{convert|80|km|ft|sp=us|disp=flip}}.<ref>The Air Force definition of outer space differs from that of the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale|International Aeronautical Federation]], which is {{convert|100|km|ft|sp=us}}.</ref>\n\n====X-15 rocket plane (1959\u201368)====\n{{Main article|North American X-15}}\n\nThe [[North American X-15|X-15]] was an NACA experimental rocket-powered [[hypersonic speed|hypersonic]] research aircraft, developed in conjunction with the US Air Force and Navy. The design featured a slender fuselage with fairings along the side containing fuel and early computerized control systems.<ref name=\"AerospacewebX15\"/> [[RFP|Requests for proposal]] were issued on December 30, 1954 for the airframe, and February 4, 1955 for the rocket engine. The airframe contract was awarded to [[North American Aviation]] in November 1955, and the XLR30 engine contract was awarded to [[Reaction Motors]] in 1956, and three planes were built. The X-15 was [[drop test|drop-launched]] from the wing of one of two NASA [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]]es, ''NB52A'' tail number 52-003, and ''NB52B'', tail number 52-008 (known as the ''[[Balls 8]]'').

Some facilities serve more than one application for historic or administrative reasons. NASA also operates a short-line [[NASA Railroad|railroad at the Kennedy Space Center]] and own special aircraft, for instance two [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft|Boeing 747 that transport Space Shuttle orbiter]].\n\nJohn F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC), is one of the best-known NASA facilities. It has been the launch site for every United States human space flight since 1968. Although such flights are currently on pause, KSC continues to manage and operate unmanned rocket launch facilities for America's civilian space program from three pads at the adjoining Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.\n\n[[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) in [[Houston]] is home to the [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center]], where all flight control is managed for manned space missions. JSC is the lead NASA center for activities regarding the [[International Space Station]] and also houses the [[NASA Astronaut Corps]] that selects, trains, and provides astronauts as crew members for US and international space missions.\n\nAnother major facility is [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] in Huntsville, Alabama at which the Saturn 5 rocket and Skylab were developed.<ref name=\"NASAMSFC_Fact_sheet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/pdf/159998main_MSFC_Fact_sheet.pdf |title=MSFC_Fact_sheet |accessdate= October 1, 2011|publisher=NASA }}</ref> The [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]] worked together with [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency|ABMA]], one of the agencies behind [[Explorer 1]], the first American space mission.\n\n[[Image:STS-128 MCC space station flight control room.jpg|thumb|[[Christopher C.
