Though not strictly an airfoil, the dolphin flipper obeys the same principles in a different fluid medium.]]\nAn '''airfoil''' (in [[American and British English spelling differences|American English]]) or '''aerofoil''' (in [[British English]]) is the shape of a [[wing]], blade (of a [[Propeller (aeronautics)|propeller]], [[Helicopter rotor|rotor]], or [[turbine]]), or [[sail]] (as seen in [[Multiview orthographic projection#Section|cross-section]]).\n\nAn airfoil-shaped body moved through a [[fluid]] produces an [[aerodynamic force]].  The component of this force [[perpendicular]] to the direction of motion is called [[lift (force)|lift]].  The component parallel to the direction of motion is called [[Drag (physics)|drag]].  [[Subsonic flight]] airfoils have a characteristic shape with a rounded leading edge, followed by a sharp trailing edge, often with a [[Symmetry|symmetric]] curvature of upper and lower surfaces.  Foils of similar function designed with water as the working fluid are called [[hydrofoil]]s.\n\nThe lift on an airfoil is primarily the result of its [[angle of attack]] and shape. When oriented at a suitable angle, the airfoil deflects the oncoming air (for fixed-wing aircraft, a downward force), resulting in [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's third law|a force on the airfoil in the direction opposite to the deflection]]. This force is known as [[aerodynamic force]] and can be resolved into two components: [[Lift (force)|lift]] and [[Drag (physics)|drag]].  Most foil shapes require a positive angle of attack to generate lift, but [[Camber (aerodynamics)|cambered]] airfoils can generate lift at zero angle of attack. This \"turning\" of the air in the vicinity of the airfoil creates curved [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]], resulting in lower pressure on one side and higher pressure on the other.  This pressure difference is accompanied by a velocity difference, via [[Bernoulli's principle]], so the resulting flowfield about the airfoil has a higher average velocity on the upper surface than on the lower surface.  The lift force can be related directly to the average top/bottom velocity difference without computing the pressure by using the concept of [[circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] and the [[Kutta-Joukowski theorem]].<ref name=HR_378a>\"...the effect of the wing is to give the air stream a downward velocity component.

Airfoils are also found in propellers, [[Fan (mechanical)|fans]], [[Axial compressor|compressors]] and [[turbines]].  Sails are also airfoils, and the underwater surfaces of sailboats, such as the [[centerboard]] and [[keel]], are similar in cross-section and operate on the same principles as airfoils.  Swimming and flying creatures and even many plants and [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] organisms employ airfoils/hydrofoils: common examples being bird wings, the bodies of fish, and the shape of [[sand dollar]]s.  An airfoil-shaped wing can create [[downforce]] on an [[automobile]] or other motor vehicle, improving [[traction (engineering)|traction]].\n\nAny object with an [[angle of attack]] in a moving fluid, such as a flat plate, a building, or the deck of a bridge, will generate an aerodynamic force (called lift) perpendicular to the flow. Airfoils are more efficient lifting shapes, able to generate more lift (up to a point), and to generate lift with less [[drag (physics)|drag]].\n\nA lift and drag curve obtained in [[wind tunnel]] testing is shown on the right.  The curve represents an airfoil with a positive [[Camber (aerodynamics)|camber]] so some lift is produced  at zero angle of attack.  With increased angle of attack, lift increases in a roughly linear relation, called the ''slope'' of the lift curve.  At about 18 degrees this airfoil stalls, and lift falls off quickly beyond that.  The drop in lift can be explained by the action of the upper-surface [[boundary layer]], which separates and greatly thickens over the upper surface at and past the stall angle.  The thickened boundary layer's [[displacement thickness]] changes the airfoil's effective shape, in particular it reduces its effective [[Camber (aerodynamics)|camber]], which modifies the overall flow field so as to reduce the [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] and the lift.  The thicker boundary layer also causes a large increase in [[pressure drag]], so that the overall drag increases sharply near and past the stall point.\n\nAirfoil design is a major facet of [[aerodynamics]]. Various airfoils serve different flight regimes. Asymmetric airfoils can generate lift at zero angle of attack, while a symmetric airfoil may better suit frequent inverted flight as in an [[aerobatic]] airplane. In the region of the [[ailerons]] and near a [[wingtip]] a symmetric airfoil can be used to increase the range of angles of attack to avoid [[spin (flight)|spin]]\u2013[[stall (flight)|stall]]. Thus a large range of angles can be used without [[Boundary Layer Separation|boundary layer separation]]. Subsonic airfoils have a round leading edge, which is naturally insensitive to the angle of attack. The cross section is not strictly circular, however: the [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] is increased before the wing achieves maximum thickness to minimize the chance of [[flow separation|boundary layer separation]].  This elongates the wing and moves the point of maximum thickness back from the leading edge.\n\n[[Supersonic airfoils]] are much more angular in shape and can have a very sharp leading edge, which is very sensitive to angle of attack. A [[supercritical airfoil]] has its maximum thickness close to the leading edge to have a lot of length to slowly shock the supersonic flow back to subsonic speeds. Generally such [[transonic]] airfoils and also the supersonic airfoils have a low camber to reduce [[drag divergence Mach number|drag divergence]]. Modern aircraft wings may have different airfoil sections along the wing span, each one optimized for the conditions in each section of the wing.\n\nMovable high-lift devices, [[flap (aircraft)|flaps]] and sometimes [[Leading edge slats|slats]], are fitted to airfoils on almost every aircraft. A trailing edge flap acts similarly to an aileron; however, it, as opposed to an aileron, can be retracted partially into the wing if not used.\n\n\nA '''laminar flow wing''' has a maximum thickness in the middle camber line. Analyzing the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]] in the linear regime shows that a negative pressure gradient along the flow has the same effect as reducing the speed. So with the maximum camber in the middle, maintaining a laminar flow over a larger percentage of the wing at a higher cruising speed is possible. However, some surface contamination will disrupt the laminar flow, making it turbulent.  For example, with rain on the wing, the flow will be turbulent.  Under certain conditions, insect debris on the wing will cause the loss of small regions of laminar flow as well.<ref>{{Cite book|url = http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19850067951|title = Flight evaluation of an insect contamination protection system for laminar flow wings|last = Croom|first = C.

That belief changed after new manufacturing methods were developed with composite materials (e.g., graphite fiber) and machined metal methods were introduced.  NASA's research in the 1980s revealed the practicality and usefulness of laminar flow wing designs and opened the way for laminar flow applications on modern practical aircraft surfaces, from subsonic general aviation aircraft to transonic large transport aircraft, to supersonic designs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Holmes|first = B.

Various airfoil generation systems are also used.  An example of a general purpose airfoil that finds wide application, and predates the NACA system, is the [[Clark-Y]].  Today, airfoils can be designed for specific functions using inverse design programs such as PROFOIL, XFOIL and AeroFoil.  XFOIL is an online program created by [[Mark Drela]] that will design and analyze subsonic isolated airfoils.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/xfoil/ XFOIL]</ref>\n\n== Airfoil terminology ==\n[[File:Wing profile nomenclature.svg|500px|thumb||Airfoil nomenclature]]\n\nThe various terms related to airfoils are defined below:<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Hurt\n | first = H.

The ''chord length'', or simply '''chord''', <math>c</math>, is the length of the chord line. That is the '''reference dimension''' of the airfoil section.\n\n[[File:Airfoil thickness definition.svg|thumb|Different definitions of airfoil thickness]]\n[[Image:PSU-90-125.PNG|thumb|An airfoil designed for [[wingtip device|winglet]]s (PSU 90-125WL)]]\nThe shape of the airfoil is defined using the following geometrical parameters:\n*The ''mean camber line'' or ''mean line'' is the locus of points midway between the upper and lower surfaces. Its shape depends on the thickness distribution along the chord;\n*The ''thickness'' of an airfoil varies along the chord.

It was devised by German-American mathematician [[Max Munk]] and further refined by British aerodynamicist [[Hermann Glauert]] and others<ref>[[Ira H.

The theory idealizes the flow around an airfoil as two-dimensional flow around a thin airfoil.  It can be imagined as addressing an airfoil of zero thickness and infinite [[wingspan]].\n\nThin airfoil theory was particularly notable in its day because it provided a sound theoretical basis for the following important properties of airfoils in two-dimensional flow:<ref>Abbott, Ira H., and Von Doenhoff, Albert E.

The mean-line, y(x), is considered to produce a distribution of [[vorticity]] <math>\\gamma (s)</math> along the line, s.  By the [[Kutta condition]], the vorticity is zero at the trailing edge.  Since the airfoil is thin, x (chord position) can be used instead of s, and all angles can be approximated as small.\n\nFrom the [[Biot\u2013Savart law]], this vorticity produces a flow field <math>w(x)</math> where\n\n:<math>w(x) = \\frac{1} {(2 \\pi)} \\int_{0}^{c} \\frac {\\gamma (x')}{(x-x')} dx'</math>\n\n<math>x</math> is the location where induced velocity is produced, <math>x'</math> is the location of the vortex element producing the velocity and <math>c</math> is the chord length of the airfoil.\n\nSince there is no flow normal to the curved surface of the airfoil, <math>w(x)</math> balances that from the component of main flow <math>V</math>, which is locally normal to the plate \u2013 the main flow is locally inclined to the plate by an angle <math>\\alpha - dy/dx</math>.
