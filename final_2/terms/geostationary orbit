Educ.&nbsp;48&nbsp;72]</ref> An object in such an orbit has an [[orbital period]] equal to the Earth's rotational period (one [[sidereal day]]) and thus appears motionless, at a fixed position in the sky, to ground observers. [[Communications satellite]]s and [[weather satellite]]s are often placed in geostationary orbits, so that the [[satellite antenna]]s (located on [[Earth]]) that communicate with them do not have to rotate to track them, but can be pointed permanently at the position in the sky where the satellites are located. Using this characteristic, ocean color satellites with visible and near-infrared light sensors (e.g. the [[Geostationary Ocean Color Imager]] (GOCI)) can also be operated in geostationary orbit in order to monitor sensitive changes of ocean environments.\n\nA [[geostationary]] orbit is a particular type of [[geosynchronous orbit]], the distinction being that while an object in geosynchronous orbit returns to the same point in the sky at the same time each day, an object in geostationary orbit never leaves that position.\n\n== History ==\nThe notion of a geostationary [[space station]] equipped with radio communication was published in 1928 by [[Herman Poto\u010dnik]].<ref name='NASA SP-4026'>{{cite book | last = Noordung | first = Hermann | authorlink = |display-authors=etal | title = The Problem With Space Travel | publisher = DIANE Publishing | date = 1995 | location = | page = 72 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7881-1849-4 | origyear=1929 | others=Translation from original German}}</ref> The first appearance of a geostationary [[orbit]] in popular literature was in the first [[Venus Equilateral]] story by [[George O.

The Clarke Orbit is about {{convert|265000|km|mi|-3|abbr=on}} in circumference.\n\n== Practical uses ==\n{{See also| Geosynchronous satellite}}\n\nMost commercial [[communications satellite]]s, [[broadcast satellite]]s and [[SBAS]] satellites operate in geostationary orbits. A [[geosynchronous transfer orbit|geostationary transfer orbit]] is used to move a satellite from [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) into a geostationary orbit. The first satellite placed into a geostationary orbit was the [[Syncom]]-3, launched by a [[Delta (rocket family)#Delta D|Delta D rocket]] in 1964.\n\nA worldwide network of operational geostationary meteorological satellites is used to provide visible and infrared images of Earth's surface and atmosphere. These satellite systems include:\n* the United States [[GOES]]\n* [[Meteosat]], launched by the [[European Space Agency]] and operated by the European Weather Satellite Organization, [[EUMETSAT]]\n* the [[Japan]]ese [[Himawari (satellite)|Himawari]]\n* Chinese [[Fengyun]]\n* [[India]]'s [[INSAT]] series\n\nA [[statite]], a hypothetical satellite that uses a [[solar sail]] to modify its orbit, could theoretically hold itself in a geostationary \"orbit\" with different altitude and/or inclination from the \"traditional\" equatorial geostationary orbit.<ref>{{cite patent |country = US |number = 5183225 |status = patent |title = STATITE: SPACECRAFT THAT UTILIZES SIGHT PRESSURE AND METHOD OF USE |pubdate = 1993-02-02 |pridate = 1989-01-09 |inventor-surname = Forward |inventor-given = Robert}}</ref>\n\n=== Orbital stability ===\nA geostationary orbit can only be achieved at an altitude very close to {{convert|35786|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} and directly above the equator. This equates to an orbital velocity of {{convert|3.07|km/s|mi/s|2| abbr=on}} and an orbital period of 1,436 minutes, which equates to almost exactly one [[sidereal day]] (23.934461223 hours). This ensures that the satellite will match the Earth's rotational period and has a stationary [[Footprint (satellite)|footprint]] on the ground. All geostationary satellites have to be located on this ring.\n\nA combination of [[Moon|lunar]] gravity, [[Sun|solar]] gravity, and the flattening of the Earth at its poles causes a [[precession]] motion of the orbital plane of any geostationary object, with an [[orbital period]] of about 53 years and an initial inclination gradient of about 0.85\u00b0 per year, achieving a maximal inclination of 15\u00b0 after 26.5 years. To correct for this [[perturbation (astronomy)|orbital perturbation]], regular [[orbital stationkeeping]] manoeuvres are necessary, amounting to a [[delta-v]] of approximately 50&nbsp;m/s per year.\n\nA second effect to be taken into account is the longitude drift, caused by the asymmetry of the Earth \u2013 the equator is slightly elliptical. There are two stable (at 75.3\u00b0E and 104.7\u00b0W) and two unstable (at 165.3\u00b0E and 14.7\u00b0W) equilibrium points. Any geostationary object placed between the equilibrium points would (without any action) be slowly accelerated towards the stable equilibrium position, causing a periodic longitude variation. The correction of this effect requires [[Orbital station-keeping#Station-keeping in geostationary orbit|station-keeping maneuvers]] with a maximal delta-v of about 2&nbsp;m/s per year, depending on the desired longitude.\n\n[[Solar wind]] and [[radiation pressure]] also exert small forces on satellites; over time, these cause them to slowly drift away from their prescribed orbits.\n\nIn the absence of servicing missions from the Earth or a renewable propulsion method, the consumption of thruster propellant for station keeping places a limitation on the lifetime of the satellite. [[Hall-effect thruster]]s, which are currently in use, have the potential to prolong the service life of a satellite by providing high-efficiency [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]].\n\n=== Communications ===\nSatellites in geostationary orbits are far enough away from Earth that communication latency becomes significant \u2014 about a quarter of a second for a trip from one ground-based transmitter to the satellite and back to another ground-based transmitter; close to half a second for a round-trip communication from one Earth station to another and then back to the first.\n\nFor example, for ground stations at [[latitudes]] of ''\u03c6''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u00b145\u00b0 on the same [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] as the satellite, the time taken for a signal to pass from Earth to the satellite and back again can be computed using the [[Pythagorean theorem#Generalizations|cosine rule]], given the geostationary orbital radius ''r'' (derived below), the [[Earth's radius]] ''R'' and the [[speed of light]] ''c'', as\n\n:<math>\\Delta t = \\frac{2}{c} \\sqrt{R^2 + r^2 - 2 R r \\cos\\varphi} \\approx 253~\\text{ms}.</math>\n\n(Note that ''r'' is the orbital radius, the distance from the centre of the Earth, not the height above the equator.)\n\nThis delay presents problems for latency-sensitive applications such as voice communication.<ref>[http://www.isoc.org/inet96/proceedings/g1/g1_3.htm The Teledesic Network: Using Low-Earth-Orbit Satellites to Provide Broadband, Wireless, Real-Time Internet Access Worldwide<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref>\n\nGeostationary satellites are directly overhead at the equator and become lower in the sky the further north or south one travels. As the observer's latitude increases, communication becomes more difficult due to factors such as atmospheric refraction, Earth's thermal emission, line-of-sight obstructions, and signal reflections from the ground or nearby structures. At latitudes above about 81\u00b0, geostationary satellites are below the horizon and cannot be seen at all.<ref>[http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/Articles/SolerEisemannJSE.pdf p. 123].</ref> Because of this, some [[Russia]]n communication satellites have used [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] [[Molniya orbit|Molniya]] and [[Tundra orbit|Tundra]] orbits, which have excellent visibility at high latitudes.\n\n=== Orbit allocation ===\nSatellites in geostationary orbit must all occupy a single ring above the [[equator]]. The requirement to space these satellites apart to avoid harmful radio-frequency interference during operations means that there are a limited number of orbital \"slots\" available, thus only a limited number of satellites can be operated in geostationary orbit. This has led to conflict between different countries wishing access to the same orbital slots (countries near the same [[longitude]] but differing [[latitudes]]) and radio frequencies. These disputes are addressed through the [[International Telecommunication Union]]'s allocation mechanism.<ref>[http://www.itu.int/ITU-R/conferences/seminars/mexico-2001/docs/06-procedure-mechanism.doc] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327092830/http://www.itu.int/ITU-R/conferences/seminars/mexico-2001/docs/06-procedure-mechanism.doc |date=March 27, 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.itu.int/ITU-R/go/space/en ITU Space Services Division].</ref> In the 1976 Bogot\u00e1 Declaration, eight countries located on the Earth's equator claimed sovereignty over the geostationary orbits above their territory, but the claims gained no international recognition.<ref>Oduntan, Gbenga. {{cite web | url =http://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/38629/HLJ_V1I2_Oduntan.pdf | title = The Never Ending Dispute: Legal Theories on the Spatial Demarcation Boundary Plane between Airspace and Outer Space}} Hertfordshire Law Journal, 1(2), p. 75.</ref>\n\n=== Limitations to usable life of geostationary satellites ===\nWhen they run out of thruster fuel, the satellites are at the end of their service life, as they are no longer able to stay in their allocated orbital position. The transponders and other onboard systems generally outlive the thruster fuel and, by stopping N\u2013S station keeping, some satellites can continue to be used in [[inclined orbit]]s (where the orbital track appears to follow a figure-eight loop centred on the equator),<ref>Shi Hu-Li, Han Yan-Ben, Ma Li-Hua, Pei Jun, Yin Zhi-Qiang and Ji Hai-Fu (2010).

Hence\n\n: <math>r = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac\\mu{\\omega^2}}</math>\n\nThe angular speed ''\u03c9'' is found by dividing the angle travelled in one revolution (360\u00b0 = 2\u03c0 [[radian|rad]]) by the orbital period (the time it takes to make one full revolution). In the case of a geostationary orbit, the orbital period is one [[sidereal day]], or {{val|86164.09054|u=seconds}}).<ref>Edited by P. Kenneth Seidelmann, \"Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac\", University Science Books,1992, p. 700.</ref> This gives\n\n: <math>\\omega \\approx \\frac{2\\pi~\\text{rad}} {86\\,164~\\text{s}} \\approx 7.2921 \\times 10^{-5}~\\text{rad/s}.</math>\n\nThe resulting orbital radius is {{convert|42164|km|mi}}. Subtracting the [[Earth radius|Earth's equatorial radius]], {{convert|6378|km|mi}}, gives the altitude of '''{{convert|35786|km|mi}}'''.\n\nOrbital speed is calculated by multiplying the angular speed by the orbital radius:\n\n: <math>v = \\omega r \\approx 3.0746~\\text{km/s} \\approx 11\\,068~\\text{km/h} \\approx 6877.8~\\text{mph}.</math>\n\nBy the same formula, we can find the geostationary-type orbit of an object in relation to [[Mars]] (this type of orbit above is referred to as an [[areostationary orbit]] if it is above Mars). The [[geocentric gravitational constant]] ''GM'' (which is ''\u03bc'') for Mars has the value of 42,828&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>s<sup>\u22122</sup>, and the known [[rotational period]] (''T'') of Mars is 88,642.66 seconds. Since ''\u03c9'' = 2{{pi}}/''T'', using the formula above, the value of ''\u03c9'' is found to be approx 7.088218\u00d710<sup>\u22125</sup>&nbsp;s<sup>\u22121</sup>. Thus ''r''<sup>3</sup> = 8.5243\u00d710<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>, whose cube root is 20,427&nbsp;km; subtracting the equatorial radius of Mars (3396.2&nbsp;km), we have 17,031&nbsp;km.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n* [[Geostationary transfer orbit]]\n* [[Graveyard orbit]]\n* [[List of orbits]]\n* [[List of satellites in geosynchronous orbit]]\n* [[Orbital stationkeeping]]\n* [[Space elevator]]\n\n== Notes==\n{{notes}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=35em}}\n{{FS1037C MS188}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm Orbital Mechanics] (Rocket and Space Technology)\n* [http://www.satsig.net/sslist.htm List of satellites in geostationary orbit]\n* [http://www.golombek.com/sat/ Clarke Belt Snapshot Calculator]\n* [http://science1.nasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/3d/JTrack3D.html/ 3D Real Time Satellite Tracking]\n* [http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/satellite/satellite-orbits/geostationary-earth-orbit.php Geostationary satellite orbit overview]\n* [http://www.p-l-a.net Daily animation of the Earth, made by geostationary satellite 'Electro L' photos] Satellite shoots 48 images of the planet every day.\n\n{{orbits}}\n{{Arthur C.
