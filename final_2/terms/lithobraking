''Lithos'' is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning \"rock\" or \"stone.\"\n\nPreparations for lithobraking involve protecting the probe with sufficient cushioning to withstand an impact with the surface and come to rest undamaged. The first successful lithobraking was achieved by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Luna 9]] probe resulting in the first soft landing on the [[Moon]]. Unlike the [[United States|US]] [[Surveyor Program|Surveyor]] probes that relied entirely on [[retrorocket]]s, first [[Luna program|Luna]] landers used a combination of retrorockets and gas-filled cushioning bags to reach the lunar surface safely. Soviet and US landers used [[airbag]]-like lithobraking for Mars landing missions as well. Alternatively due to extremely dense atmosphere on Venus later generation [[Venera]] landers used hard umbrella-like aerobraker in combination with shock absorbers. \n\nIncoming angles are made shallow enough such that the impact has the characteristic of a glancing blow, rather than a direct impact on the surface. In the case of bodies with a sufficiently thick atmosphere (e.g., [[Mars]]), lithobraking is typically accompanied by the use of other techniques like [[retrorocket]] braking, use of [[heat shield]]s and [[parachute]]s to reduce speed prior to impact. The [[Mars Pathfinder]] and [[Mars Exploration Rover]] programs have used this approach successfully.\n\nAlternatively, the incoming velocity can be used to enable the probe to penetrate the surface.\nThis approach can be tried on bodies with low gravitation, such as [[comet]]s and [[asteroid]]s, or on planets with atmospheres (by using only small parachutes, or no parachutes at all).  Several such missions have been launched, including penetrators on the two [[Phobos program|Phobos probe landers]] targeted for Mars' moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and ones for Mars itself on [[Mars 96]] and [[Deep Space 2]], but so far none have succeeded. The cancelled [[LUNAR-A]] probe would have carried penetrators to the [[Moon]].\n\nLithobraking as a method for de-orbiting a spacecraft has not been used due to the extremely high orbital velocities of most bodies (e.g. for the Moon it is over 7000&nbsp;km/h). However, some small moons and asteroids have very low gravity and it could conceivably be used there (e.g. Phobos has an ''[[escape velocity]]'' of 40&nbsp;km/h.)\n\nCertain concepts involve the spacecraft in an orbit tangent to the surface of the body in question, and \"docking\" with a [[magnetic levitation|magnetically levitated]] (maglev) [[magnetic levitation train|train]], and the train then slowing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1988LPICo.652...26B |title=Lunar Landing via a Linear Accelerator |author=Binder, A. B}}</ref>  This qualifies as lithobraking, as the reaction mass is the planet itself.  This technique requires extremely precise guidance and control, in addition to a large infrastructure, and is thus not yet a viable option \u2013 although it may be in the future.  An advantage to this method is that it can also launch spacecraft, without needing propellant.\n\nLithobraking is also used as a humorous euphemism for the result of a spacecraft crashing into the surface of a body with no measures to ensure its survival, either by accident or with intent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/204672-nasas-messenger-probe-is-crashing-into-mercury-today |title=NASA\u2019s MESSENGER probe is crashing into Mercury today |publisher=Extreme Tech |date=30 April 2015 |author=Ryan Whitwam}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal| Spaceflight }}\n*[[Aerocapture]]\n*[[Aerogravity assist]]\n*[[Asteroid capture]]\n*[[Atmospheric reentry]]\n*[[Skip reentry]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Spacecraft propulsion]]"}]}}}}
