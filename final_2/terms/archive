Professional [[archivist]]s and historians generally understand archives to be records that have been naturally and necessarily generated as a product of regular legal, commercial, administrative, or social activities. They have been metaphorically defined as \"the secretions of an organism\",<ref>{{cite book |first=V.H. |last=Galbraith |authorlink=Vivian Hunter Galbraith |title=Studies in the Public Records |place=London |year=1948 |page=3 }}</ref> and are distinguished from documents that have been consciously written or created to communicate a particular message to posterity. <!--removed from another section where it was irrelevant; may wish to be incorporated: The word ''archive'' can refer to any organised body of records fixed on media. The management of archives is essential for effective day-to-day organisational decision making, and even for the survival of organisations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}-->\n\nIn general, archives consist of records that have been selected for permanent or long-term preservation on grounds of their enduring cultural, historical, or evidentiary value. Archival records are normally unpublished and almost always unique, unlike books or magazines for which many identical copies exist. This means that archives are quite distinct from libraries with regard to their functions and organization, although archival collections can often be found within library buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/archives|title=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology |accessdate=7 December 2012 |publisher=Society of American Archivists}}</ref>\n\nA person who works in archives is called an [[archivist]]. The study and practice of organizing, preserving, and providing access to information and materials in archives is called [[archival science]]. The physical place of storage can be referred to as an archive (more usual in the UK), an archives (more usual in the USA), or a repository.<ref>{{cite web|title=Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology|url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/archives|publisher=Society of American Archivists|accessdate=2013-10-21}}</ref>\n\nWhen referring to historical records or the places they are kept, the plural form ''archives'' is chiefly used.<ref>\"archive\" ''The Oxford English Dictionary''. 2nd ed. 1989. [[OED Online]]. [[Oxford University Press]].</ref> The computing use of the term 'archive' should not be confused with the record-keeping meaning of the term.\n\n==Etymology==\nFirst attested in English in early 17th century, the word ''archive'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0251r|k|a\u026a|v}} is derived from the French ''archives'' (plural), in turn from [[Latin]] ''arch\u012bum'' or ''arch\u012bvum'',<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Darchium arch\u012bum], Charlton T.

The adjective formed from ''archive'' is ''archival''.\n\n==History==\nThe practice of keeping official documents is very old. Archeologists have discovered archives of hundreds (and sometime thousands) of clay tablets going back to the third and second millennia BC in sites like [[Ebla]], [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], [[Amarna]], [[Hattusas]], [[Ugarit]], and [[Pylos]]. These discoveries have been fundamental to know ancient alphabets, languages, literatures, and politics.\n\nArchives were well developed by the ancient Chinese, the ancient Greeks, and ancient Romans (who called them ''[[Tabularium|Tabularia]]''). However, they have been lost, since documents written on materials like [[papyrus]] and paper deteriorated at a faster pace unlike their stone tablet counterparts. Archives of churches, kingdoms and cities from the Middle Ages on survive and often have kept their official status uninterruptedly till now. They are the basic tool for historical research on these ages.\n\nModern archival thinking has many roots in the French Revolution. The [[French National Archives]], who possess perhaps the largest archival collection in the world, with records going as far back as A.D. 625, were created in 1790 during the [[French Revolution]] from various government, religious, and private archives seized by the revolutionaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/archive |title=archive: Definition, Synonyms from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=1 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Users and institutions==\n[[File:Staatsarchiv Erdberg Sep 2006 002.jpg|thumb|right|Reading room of the [[:de:\u00d6sterreichisches Staatsarchiv|\u00d6sterreichisches Staatsarchiv]] (Austrian State Archive), in the Erdberg district of Vienna (2006)]]\nHistorians, [[genealogist]]s, lawyers, [[demographer]]s, filmmakers, and others conduct research at archives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/archives/about/what-are-archives |title=What Are Archives? |accessdate=2 September 2014 |publisher=[[National Museum of American History]] |deadurl=no<!--present in archive.org--> }}</ref>  The research process at each archive is unique, and depends upon the institution that houses the archive.

The archives of an organization (such as a corporation or government) tend to contain other types of records, such as administrative files, business records, memos, official correspondence, and meeting minutes.\n\n==Standardization==\nThe [[International Council on Archives]] (ICA) has developed a number of standards on archival description including the General International Standard Archival Description ISAD(G).<ref>[http://www.ica.org/10206/standards/standards-list.html ICA Standards Page]</ref> ISAD(G) is meant to be used in conjunction with national standards or as a basis for nations to build their own standards.<ref>[http://www.ica.org/en/node/30000 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818015843/http://www.ica.org/en/node/30000 |date=18 August 2010 }}</ref> In the United States, ISAD(G) is implemented through [[Describing Archives: A Content Standard]], popularly known as \"DACS\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Describing Archives: A Content Standard|url=http://www.archivists.org/governance/standards/dacs.asp|publisher=Society of American Archivists|accessdate=20 August 2010}}</ref> In Canada, ISAD(G) is implemented through the Council of Archives<ref>http://www.cdncouncilarchives.ca/Canadian</ref> as the [[Rules for Archival Description]], also known as \"RAD\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rules for Archival Description|year=1990|publisher=Bureau of Canadian Archivists|isbn=0-9690797-3-7|url=http://www.cdncouncilarchives.ca/archdesrules.html}}</ref>\n\n[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] is currently working on standards.<ref name=hisa>{{cite web\n  | last = [[International Organization for Standardization]]\n  | title = ISO/NP TS 21547-1 Health informatics \u2013 Secure archiving of electronic health records \u2013 Part 1: Principles and requirements\n  | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=44479\n  | accessdate =19 July 2008\n  }}</ref><ref name=dma>{{cite web\n  | last = [[International Organization for Standardization]]\n  | title = ISO/DIS 11506 Document management applications \u2013 Archiving of electronic data \u2013 Computer output microform (COM) / Computer output laser disc (COLD)\n  | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50565\n  | accessdate =19 July 2008\n  }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Archival informatics]]\n* [[Archival research]]\n* [[Archival science]]\n* ''[[Archive Fever]]'' (book by [[Jacques Derrida]])\n* [[Archive file]]\n* [[Archivist]]\n* [[BS 5454]]\n* [[Collection (museum)]]\n* [[Computer data storage]]\n* [[Data proliferation]]\n* [[Database]]\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Digital preservation]]\n* [[Discovered text (archaeology)]]\n* [[Greenstone (software)]]\n* [[Historical document]]\n* [[Information management]]\n* [[Information repository]]\n* [[International Council on Archives]]\n* [[Internet Archive]]\n* [[Manuscript processing]]\n* [[Preservation (library and archival science)]]\n* [[List of archives]] and [[List of national archives]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|archive}}\n{{Commons category|Archives}}\n* [http://www.ica.org/ International Council on Archives]\n* [http://archiveshub.ac.uk/ Archives Hub] \u2014 search across descriptions of archives held in over 280 institutions across the UK\n* [http://www.interpares.org/ InterPARES Project] \u2014 international research project on the long-term preservation of authentic digital records\n* [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a Access to Archives (A2A)] \u2014 the English strand of the UK archives network\n* [http://www.archivesmadeeasy.org/ Online-Guide to Archives around the globe]\n* [http://www.aim25.ac.uk/ AIM25] \u2013 archives within the UK [[M25 motorway|M25]] area.\n* [http://www.cartoons.ac.uk/ British Cartoon Archive] associated with the University of Kent\n* [http://daln.osu.edu/ The Digital Archive of Literacy Narratives]\n* [http://www.lacasadisangiorgio.it/ Banco di San Giorgio] \u2013 Genova Italy: Archive (1407\u20131805): nearly 40,000 books catalogued with full description.  www.giuseppefelloni.it\n* [http://uiuc.libguides.com/aecontent.php?pid=27055 Slavic Archives]\n* [http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/ Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)]\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2012}}\n\n{{Historiography}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Archives|*]]\n[[Category:Documents]]\n[[Category:Works about history]]"}]}}}}
