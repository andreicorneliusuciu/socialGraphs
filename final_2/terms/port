Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and [[Navigability|navigable water]], for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger, more economical ships.  Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role.\n\n==Historical==\nOne of the world's oldest known artificial harbors is at [[Wadi al-Jarf]] on the [[Red Sea]]. Along with the finding of harbor structures, ancient anchors have also been found.\n\n===Ancient China===\n[[Port of Guangzhou|Guangzhou]] was an important port during the ancient times as far back as the [[Qin Dynasty]].\n\n===Ancient Egypt===\n\n[[Canopus,_Egypt|Canopus]] was the principal port in Egypt for Greek trade before the foundation of [[Alexandria]].\n\n===Ancient Greece===\n\nAthens' port of [[Piraeus]] was the base for the Athenian fleet and this played a crucial role in the [[battle of Salamis]] against the Persians in 480 BC.\n\n===Ancient India===\n[[Lothal]] is one of the most prominent cities of the ancient Indus valley civilisation, located in the Bh\u0101l region of the modern state of Gujar\u0101t and dating from 3700 BCE.\n\n===Ancient Rome===\n[[Ostia Antica]] was the port of ancient Rome with [[Portus]] established by [[Claudius]] and enlarged by [[Trajan]] to supplement the nearby port of Ostia.\n\n=== Japan ===\n\nDuring the [[Edo period]], the island of [[Dejima]] was the only open port for trade with Europe and only received one Dutch ship per year, whereas [[Osaka]] was the largest domestic port and the main trade hub for rice.\n\n==Distribution==\nPorts often have [[cargo]]-handling equipment, such as [[Crane (machine)|cranes]] (operated by [[longshoremen]]) and [[forklift]]s for use in loading ships, which may be provided by private interests or public bodies.\nOften, [[canning|canneries]] or other processing facilities will be located nearby.  Some ports feature [[canal]]s, which allow ships further movement inland.\nAccess to intermodal transportation, such as railroads and highways, is critical to a port, so that passengers and cargo can also move further inland beyond the port area.\nPorts with international traffic have [[customs]] facilities.\n[[Maritime pilot|Harbor pilot]]s and [[tugboat]]s may maneuver large ships in tight quarters when near [[Dock (maritime)|docks]].\n\n==Types==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2012}}\nThe terms \"port\" and \"seaport\" are used for different types of port facilities that handle ocean-going vessels, and '''river port''' is used for river traffic, such as [[barge]]s and other shallow-draft vessels.\n\n===Inland port===\n{{main|Inland port}}\nAn '''inland port''' is a port on a navigable lake, river (fluvial port), or canal with access to a sea or ocean, which therefore allows a ship to sail from the ocean inland to the port to load or unload its cargo. An example of this is the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] which allows ships to travel from the Atlantic Ocean several thousand kilometers inland to Great Lakes ports like [[Twin Ports|Duluth-Superior]] and [[Chicago]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatlakes-seaway.com/en/|title=Seaway System|work=greatlakes-seaway.com}}</ref>\n\n===Fishing port===\nA '''fishing port''' is a port or [[harbor]]  for landing and distributing fish. It may be a recreational facility, but it is usually commercial. A fishing port is the only port that depends on an ocean product, and depletion of fish may cause a fishing port to be uneconomical. In recent decades, regulations to save fishing stock may limit the use of a fishing port, perhaps effectively closing it.\n\n===Dry port===\n{{main|Dry port}}\nA '''dry port''' is an inland [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] terminal directly connected by [[road]] or [[Rail transport|rail]] to a seaport and operating as a centre for the [[transshipment]] of sea cargo to inland destinations.<ref>{{cite web| title = Feasibility Study on the network operation of Hinterland Hubs (Dry Port Concept) to improve and modernise ports' connections to the hinterland and to improve networking| publisher =InLoc |date=January 2007 | url =http://www.inloc.info/internal/wp1/activity_15_feasibility_study_dry_ports.pdf | accessdate =2008-03-10 }}</ref>\n\n===Warm-water port===\nA '''warm-water port'''{{anchor|warm water port}} is one where the water does not freeze in wintertime. Because they are available year-round, warm-water ports can be of great geopolitical or economic interest. Such settlements as [[Dalian]] in China, [[Vostochny Port]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vpnet.ru/eng/geo/main_geo.htm |title=Vostochny Port JSC, Geography, Location |work=Vostochny Port website|year=2007 |accessdate=13 December 2012 |quote=...&nbsp; Vostochny Port is located in the south of Primorsky Region, in the southeast of Nakhodka bay, in Vrangel bay. This is unique natural harbor is no ice restrictions even in severe winters.&nbsp;... }}</ref> [[Murmansk]] and [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]] in Russia, [[Odessa]] in Ukraine, [[Kushiro, Hokkaid\u014d|Kushiro]] in Japan and [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]] at the terminus of the [[Alaska Pipeline]] owe their very existence to being ice-free ports. The Baltic Sea and similar areas have ports available year-round thanks to [[icebreaker]]s beginning in the 20th century, but earlier access problems prompted Russia to expand its territory to the [[Black Sea]].\n\n===Seaport===\nA '''seaport''' is further categorized as a \"cruise port\" or a \"cargo port\". Additionally, \"cruise ports\" are also known as a \"home port\" or a \"port of call\". The \"cargo port\" is also further categorized into a \"bulk\" or \"break bulk port\" or as a \"container port\".\n\n====Cruise home port====\nA '''cruise home port''' is the port where cruise-ship passengers board (or [[embark]]) to start their cruise and [[disembark]] the cruise ship at the end of their cruise. It is also where the cruise ship's supplies are loaded for the cruise, which includes everything from fresh water and fuel to fruits, vegetables, champagne, and any other supplies needed for the cruise. \"Cruise home ports\" are a very busy place during the day the cruise ship is in port, because off-going passengers debark their baggage and on-coming passengers board the ship in addition to all the supplies being loaded. Currently, the ''Cruise Capital of the World'' is the [[Port of Miami]], [[Florida]], closely followed behind by [[Port Everglades]], Florida and the [[Port of San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]].\n\n====Port of call====\nA '''port of call''' is an intermediate stop for a ship on its sailing itinerary. At these ports, cargo ships may take on supplies or fuel, as well as unloading and loading cargo while cruise liners have passengers get on or off ship.\n\n====Cargo port====\n'''Cargo ports''', on the other hand, are quite different from cruise ports, because each handles very different cargo, which has to be loaded and unloaded by very different mechanical means. The port may handle one particular type of cargo or it may handle numerous cargoes, such as grains, liquid fuels, liquid chemicals, wood, automobiles, etc.  Such ports are known as the \"bulk\" or \"break bulk ports\". Those ports that handle containerized cargo are known as container ports. Most cargo ports handle all sorts of cargo, but some ports are very specific as to what cargo they handle. Additionally, the individual cargo ports are divided into different operating terminals which handle the different cargoes, and are operated by different companies, also known as terminal operators or [[stevedore]]s.\n\n==Access==\nPorts sometimes fall out of use. [[Rye, East Sussex]], was an important [[England|English]] port in the Middle Ages, but the coastline changed and it is now {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the sea, while the ports of [[Ravenspurn]] and [[Dunwich]] have been lost to [[coastal erosion]].\nAlso in the United Kingdom, [[London]], on the [[River Thames]], was once an important international port, but changes in shipping methods, such as the use of containers and larger ships, put it at a disadvantage.\n\n==Environmental impact==\nThere are several initiatives to decrease negative environmental impacts of ports. These include [[SIMPYC]], the [[World Ports Climate Initiative]], the [[African Green Port Initiative]] and [[EcoPorts]].<ref>EOS magazine, 6,2012</ref>\n\n==World's major ports==\n{{main|List of seaports}}\n\n===Africa===\n{{See also|Ports and harbours in South Africa}}\nThe busiest port in Africa is [[Port Said]] in Egypt.\n\n===Asia===\n{{See also|List of East Asian ports|List of ports and harbours of the Indian Ocean}}\n[[File:VizagPort.jpg|thumb|[[Visakhapatnam]] sea port]]\nThe [[port of Shanghai]] is the largest port in the world in both [[List of world's busiest ports by cargo tonnage|cargo tonnage]] and activity.

It is followed by the ports of [[Singapore]] and [[port of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], both of which are in [[Asia]].\n\n===Europe===\n{{See also|List of busiest ports in Europe}}\nEurope's busiest container port and biggest port by cargo tonnage by far is the [[Port of Rotterdam]], in the Netherlands. It is followed by the Belgian [[Port of Antwerp]] or the German [[Port of Hamburg]], depending on which metric is used.<ref>[http://aapa.files.cms-plus.com/PDFs/WORLD%20PORT%20RANKINGS%202011.pdf World Port Rankings 2011 (PDF)]</ref> In turn, [[Valencia (Spain)|Valencia]] (Spain) is the busiest port in the Mediterranean basin.\n\n===North America===\n{{See also|List of North American ports|Ports of the United States}}\nThe largest ports include the ports of [[Port of Los Angeles|Los Angeles]] and [[Port of South Louisiana|South Louisiana]] in the U.S., [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]] in Mexico and [[Port Metro Vancouver|Vancouver]] in Canada. [[Panama]] also has the [[Panama Canal]] that connects the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean, and is a key conduit for international trade.\n\n===Oceania===\nThe largest port in Australia is the [[Port of Melbourne]].\n\n===South America===\nThe largest ports in South America are the [[Port of Santos]] in Brazil and [[Valpara\u00edso]] in Chile.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Anchorage (shipping)]]\n*[[Megaproject]]\n\n===Water port topics===\n*[[Bandar (port)|Bandar]] (Persian word for \"port\" or \"haven\")\n*[[Marina]] - port for recreational boating\n*[[Port operator]]\n*[[Ship transport]]\n\n===Other types of ports===\n*[[Airport]]\n*[[Spaceport]]\n*[[Port of entry]]\n\n===Lists===\n*[[Lists of ports]]\n*[[List of busiest cruise ports by passengers]]\n*[[World's busiest port]]\n*[[:Category:Sea rescue organisations|Sea rescue organisations]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Ports and harbours}}\n*[http://www.aapa-ports.org/Industry/content.cfm?ItemNumber=900&navItemNumber=551 Port Industry Statistics, American Association of Port Authorities]\n*[http://www.noonsite.com/text/Countries Information on yachting facilities at 1,613 ports in 191 countries from Noonsite.com]\n*[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/esb/?goal=commerce&file=obs/marine/ports/ Social & Economic Benefits of PORTS] from \"NOAA Socioeconomics\" website initiative\n* Antunes, C\u00e1tia: [http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0159-2010102547 ''Early Modern Ports, 1500-1750''], [[European History Online]], Mainz: [[Institute of European History]], 2011, retrieved: November 2, 2011.\n\n{{Ports and harbors}}\n{{Public infrastructure topics}}\n{{developments}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Ports and harbours| ]]\n[[Category:Nautical terminology]]"}]}}}}
