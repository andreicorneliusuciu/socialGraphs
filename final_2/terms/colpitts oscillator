Fig. 1 shows the common-base Colpitts circuit.  ''L'' and the series combination of ''C''<sub>1</sub> and ''C''<sub>2</sub> form the parallel resonant [[tank circuit]] which determines the frequency of the oscillator.  The voltage across ''C''<sub>2</sub> is applied to the base-emitter junction of the transistor, as feedback to create oscillations.  Fig. 2 shows the common-collector version.  Here the voltage across ''C''<sub>1</sub> provides feedback.  The frequency of oscillation is approximately the resonant frequency of the LC circuit, which is the series combination of the two capacitors in parallel with the inductor\n:<math>f_0 = {1 \\over 2 \\pi \\sqrt {L \\left ({ C_1 C_2 \\over C_1 + C_2 }\\right ) }}</math>\nThe actual frequency of oscillation will be slightly lower due to junction capacitances and resistive loading of the transistor.\n\nAs with any oscillator, the amplification of the active component should be marginally larger than the attenuation of the capacitive voltage divider, to obtain stable operation. Thus, a Colpitts oscillator used as a [[variable frequency oscillator]] (VFO) performs best when a variable inductance is used for tuning, as opposed to tuning one of the two capacitors. If tuning by variable capacitor is needed, it should be done via a third capacitor connected in parallel to the inductor (or in series as in the [[Clapp oscillator]]).\n\n===Practical example===\n\n[[Image:NPN Colpitts oscillator collector coil.svg|thumb|300px|Figure 3: Practical{{dubious|Figure 3|date=March 2016}} common base Colpitts oscillator with an oscillation frequency of ~50 MHz]]\n\nFig. 3 shows a working example with component values. Instead of [[bipolar junction transistor]]s, other active components such as [[field effect transistors]] or  [[vacuum tube]]s, capable of producing gain at the desired frequency, could be used.\n\nThe capacitor at the base provides an AC path to ground for parasitic inductances that could lead to unwanted resonance at undesired frequencies.<ref>[http://www.ece.ucsb.edu/Faculty/rodwell/Classes/ece218b/notes/Oscillators2.pdf University of California Santa Barbara Untitled Publication], p. 3.</ref> Selection of the base's biasing resistors is not trivial. Periodic oscillation starts for a critical bias current and with the variation of the bias current to a higher value chaotic oscillations are observed.<ref>S. Sarkar, S. Sarkar, B. C. Sarkar.

''IJEAT'' {{ISSN|2249-8958}}, Volume-2, Issue-5, June 2013. p. 1.</ref>\n\n==Theory==\n[[Image:Colpitts ideal model.svg|thumb|right|250px|Ideal Colpitts oscillator model (common collector configuration)]]\n\nOne method of oscillator analysis is to determine the input impedance of an input port neglecting any reactive components. If the impedance yields a [[negative resistance]] term, oscillation is possible. This method will be used here to determine conditions of oscillation and the frequency of oscillation.\n\nAn ideal model is shown to the right. This configuration models the common collector circuit in the section above. For initial analysis, parasitic elements and device non-linearities will be ignored. These terms can be included later in a more rigorous analysis. Even with these approximations, acceptable comparison with experimental results is possible.\n\nIgnoring the inductor, the input [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] at the base can be written as\n\n:<math>Z_{in} = \\frac{v_1}{i_1}</math>\n\nWhere <math>v_1</math> is the input voltage and <math>i_1</math> is the input current. The voltage <math>v_2</math> is given by\n\n:<math>v_2 = i_2 Z_2</math>\n\nWhere <math>Z_2</math> is the impedance of <math>C_2</math>. The current flowing into <math>C_2</math> is <math>i_2</math>, which is the sum of two currents:\n\n:<math>i_2 = i_1 + i_s</math>\n\nWhere <math>i_s</math> is the current supplied by the transistor. <math>i_s</math> is a dependent current source given by\n\n:<math>i_s = g_m \\left ( v_1 - v_2 \\right )</math>\n\nWhere <math>g_m</math> is the [[transconductance]] of the transistor. The input current <math>i_1</math> is given by\n\n:<math>i_1 = \\frac{v_1 - v_2}{Z_1}</math>\n\nWhere <math>Z_1</math> is the impedance of <math>C_1</math>. Solving for <math>v_2</math> and substituting above yields\n\n:<math>Z_{in} = Z_1 + Z_2 + g_m Z_1 Z_2</math>\n\nThe input impedance appears as the two capacitors in series with an interesting term, <math>R_{in}</math> which is proportional to the product of the two impedances:\n\n:<math>R_{in} = g_m \\cdot Z_1 \\cdot Z_2</math>\n\nIf <math>Z_1</math> and <math>Z_2</math> are complex and of the same sign, <math>R_{in}</math> will be a [[negative resistance]]. If the impedances for <math>Z_1</math> and <math>Z_2</math> are substituted, <math>R_{in}</math> is\n\n:<math>R_{in} = \\frac{-g_m}{\\omega ^ 2 C_1 C_2}</math>\n\nIf an inductor is connected to the input, the circuit will oscillate if the magnitude of the negative resistance is greater than the resistance of the inductor and any stray elements. The frequency of oscillation is as given in the previous section.\n\nFor the example oscillator above, the emitter current is roughly 1 [[Ampere|mA]]. The transconductance is roughly 40 [[Siemens (unit)|mS]]. Given all other values, the input resistance is roughly\n\n:<math>R_{in} = -30 \\ \\Omega</math>\n\nThis value should be sufficient to overcome any positive resistance in the circuit. By inspection, oscillation is more likely for larger values of transconductance and smaller values of capacitance.  A more complicated analysis of the common-base oscillator reveals that a low frequency amplifier voltage gain must be at least four to achieve oscillation.<ref>Razavi, B.  Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits. McGraw-Hill. 2001.</ref>  The low frequency gain is given by:\n\n:<math>A_v = g_m \\cdot R_p  \\ge 4</math>\n\n[[File:Oscillator comparison.svg|thumb|Comparison of Hartley and Colpitts oscillator]]\nIf the two capacitors are replaced by inductors and magnetic coupling is ignored, the circuit becomes a [[Hartley oscillator]]. In that case, the input impedance is the sum of the two inductors and a negative resistance given by:\n\n:<math>R_{in} = -g_m \\omega ^ 2 L_1 L_2</math>\n\nIn the Hartley circuit, oscillation is more likely for larger values of transconductance and larger values of inductance.\n\nInterestingly, the above analysis also describes the behavior of the [[Pierce oscillator]]. The Pierce oscillator, with two capacitors and one inductor, is equivalent to the Colpitts oscillator.<ref>Theron Jones.

Maxim tutorial 5265 Sep 18, 2012, Maxim Integrated Products, Inc</ref> Equivalence can be shown by choosing the junction of the two capacitors as the ground point. An electrical dual of the standard Pierce oscillator using two inductors and one capacitor is equivalent to the [[Hartley oscillator]].\n\n===Oscillation amplitude===\nThe amplitude of oscillation is generally difficult to predict, but it can often be accurately estimated using the [[describing function]] method.\n\nFor the common-base oscillator in Figure 1, this approach applied to a simplified model predicts an output (collector) voltage amplitude given by:<ref>Trade-Offs in Analog Circuit Design: The Designer's Companion, Part 1\n By Chris Toumazou, George S.
