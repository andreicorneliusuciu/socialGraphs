Since [[Energy-mass equivalence|energy and mass are equivalent]], all forms of [[energy]], including [[light]], also cause gravitation and are under the influence of it. On [[Earth]], gravity gives [[weight]] to physical objects and causes the ocean [[tides]].  The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the [[Universe]] caused it to begin coalescing, forming [[star]]s \u2014 and the stars to group together into [[galaxy|galaxies]] \u2014 so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe.  Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects.\n\nGravity is most accurately described by the [[general theory of relativity]] (proposed by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1915) which describes gravity not as a [[force]], but as a consequence of the curvature of [[spacetime]] caused by the uneven distribution of [[mass]]/[[energy]]. The most extreme example of this curvature of spacetime is a [[black hole]], from which nothing can escape once past its event horizon, not even light.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hubblesite.org/explore_astronomy/black_holes/home.html|title=HubbleSite: Black Holes: Gravity's Relentless Pull|website=hubblesite.org|access-date=2016-10-07}}</ref> More gravity results in [[gravitational time dilation]], where time lapses more slowly at a lower (stronger) [[gravitational potential]]. However, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], which postulates that gravity causes a [[force]] where two bodies of mass are directly drawn (or 'attracted') to each other according to a mathematical relationship, where the attractive force is [[proportionality (mathematics)|directly proportional]] to the product of their masses and [[inversely proportional]] to the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the [[distance]] between them.<!---This is considered{{by whom|date=February 2016}} to occur over an infinite range, such that all bodies (with mass) in the Universe are drawn to each other no matter how far they are apart.{{citation needed|date=February 2016|reason=infinite range claim is not supported in the body of this article}}--->\n\nGravity is the weakest of the four [[fundamental interaction]]s of nature. The gravitational attraction is approximately 10<sup>38</sup> times weaker than the [[Strong interaction|strong force]], 10<sup>36</sup> times weaker than the [[electromagnetic force]] and 10<sup>29</sup> times weaker than the [[Weak interaction|weak force]]. As a consequence, gravity has a negligible influence on the behavior of subatomic particles, and plays no role in determining the internal properties of everyday matter (but see [[quantum gravity]]). On the other hand, gravity is the dominant interaction at the [[macroscopic scale]], and is the cause of the formation, shape and [[trajectory]] ([[orbit]]) of astronomical bodies. It is responsible for various phenomena observed on Earth and throughout the Universe; for example, it causes the Earth and the other planets to orbit the Sun, the [[Moon]] to orbit the Earth, the formation of [[tide]]s, the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System]], [[stellar evolution|stars]] and [[galaxy formation and evolution|galaxies]].\n\nThe earliest instance of gravity in the Universe, possibly in the form of [[quantum gravity]], [[supergravity]] or a [[gravitational singularity]], along with ordinary [[space]] and [[time]], developed during the [[Timeline of the formation of the Universe#Planck Epoch|Planck epoch]] (up to 10<sup>\u221243</sup> seconds after the [[Big Bang|birth]] of the [[Universe]]), possibly from a primeval state, such as a [[false vacuum]], [[quantum vacuum]] or [[virtual particle]], in a currently unknown manner.<ref name=\"Planck-UOregon\">{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Birth of the Universe |url=http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec20.html |date= |work=[[University of Oregon]] |accessdate=September 24, 2016 }} - discusses \"[[Planck time]]\" and \"[[Planck era]]\" at the [[Big Bang|very beginning]] of the [[Universe]]</ref> For this reason, in part, pursuit of a [[theory of everything]], the merging of the general theory of relativity and [[quantum mechanics]] (or [[quantum field theory]]) into [[quantum gravity]], has become an area of research.\n\n==History of gravitational theory==\n{{main article|History of gravitational theory}}\n===Earlier Concepts of Gravity===\n\nWhile the modern European thinkers are rightly credited with development of gravitational theory, there were pre-existing ideas which had identified the force of gravity.\nSome of the earliest descriptions came from early mathematician-astronomers, such as [[Aryabhata]], who had identified the force of gravity to explain why objects do not fall out when the Earth rotates.<ref>*{{cite book\n | first= Amartya\n | last= Sen\n | title= The Argumentative Indian\n | date= 2005\n | page= 29\n | publisher= Allen Lane\n | isbn= 978-0-7139-9687-6}} </ref>\n\nLater, the works of [[Brahmagupta]] referred to the presence of this force.{{cn|date=October 2016}}\n\n===Scientific revolution===\nModern work on gravitational theory began with the work of [[Galileo Galilei]] in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.

In his own words, \"I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must [be] reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centers about which they revolve: and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the Moon in her Orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the Earth; and found them answer pretty nearly.\"<ref>*{{cite book\n | first= Subrahmanyan\n | last= Chandrasekhar\n | authorlink= Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar\n | title= Newton's Principia for the common reader\n | date= 2003\n | publisher= Oxford University Press\n | location= Oxford}} (pp.1\u20132).  The quotation comes from a memorandum thought to have been written about 1714. As early as 1645 [[Isma\u00ebl Bullialdus]] had argued that any force exerted by the Sun on distant objects would have to follow an inverse-square law.  However, he also dismissed the idea that any such force did exist. See, for example,\n{{cite book | title= From Eudoxus to Einstein\u2014A History of Mathematical Astronomy\n | author= Linton, Christopher M.\n | publisher= Cambridge University Press\n | date= 2004\n | location= Cambridge\n | page= 225\n | isbn= 978-0-521-82750-8\n | ref= Linton-2004}}\n</ref> The equation is the following:\n\n<math>F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}\\ </math>\n\nWhere ''F'' is the force, ''m<sub>1</sub>'' and ''m<sub>2</sub>'' are the masses of the objects interacting, ''r'' is the distance between the centers of the masses and ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]].\n\nNewton's theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the existence of [[Neptune]] based on motions of [[Uranus]] that could not be accounted for by the actions of the other planets. Calculations by both [[John Couch Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier]] predicted the general position of the planet, and Le Verrier's calculations are what led [[Johann Gottfried Galle]] to the discovery of Neptune.\n\nA discrepancy in [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s orbit pointed out flaws in Newton's theory. By the end of the 19th century, it was known that its orbit showed slight perturbations that could not be accounted for entirely under Newton's theory, but all searches for another perturbing body (such as a planet orbiting the [[Sun]] even closer than Mercury) had been fruitless. The issue was resolved in 1915 by [[Albert Einstein]]'s new theory of [[general relativity]], which accounted for the small discrepancy in Mercury's orbit.\n\nAlthough Newton's theory has been superseded by the [[Einstein]]'s general relativity, most modern [[Theory of relativity|non-relativistic]] gravitational calculations are still made using Newton's theory because it is simpler to work with and it gives sufficiently accurate results for most applications involving sufficiently small masses, speeds and energies.\n\n===Equivalence principle===\nThe [[equivalence principle]], explored by a succession of researchers including Galileo, [[Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]], and Einstein, expresses the idea that all objects fall in the same way, and that the effects of gravity are indistinguishable from certain aspects of acceleration and deceleration.  The simplest way to test the weak equivalence principle is to drop two objects of different [[mass]]es or compositions in a vacuum and see whether they hit the ground at the same time. Such experiments demonstrate that all objects fall at the same rate when other forces (such as air resistance and electromagnetic effects) are negligible. More sophisticated tests use a torsion balance of a type invented by E\u00f6tv\u00f6s. Satellite experiments, for example [[STEP (satellite)|STEP]], are planned for more accurate experiments in space.<ref>{{cite web |author=M.C.W.Sandford |publisher=[[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] |title=STEP: Satellite Test of the Equivalence Principle |url=http://www.sstd.rl.ac.uk/fundphys/step/ |date=2008 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}</ref>\n\nFormulations of the equivalence principle include:\n* The weak equivalence principle: ''The trajectory of a point mass in a [[gravitational field]] depends only on its initial position and velocity, and is independent of its composition.''<ref name=Wesson>{{cite book |title=Five-dimensional Physics |author= Paul S Wesson |page=82 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dSv8ksxHR0oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:Five+intitle:Dimensional+intitle:Physics |isbn=981-256-661-9 |publisher=World Scientific |date=2006}}</ref>\n* The Einsteinian equivalence principle: ''The outcome of any local non-gravitational experiment in a freely falling laboratory is independent of the velocity of the laboratory and its location in spacetime.''<ref name=\"L\u0101mmerzahl\">{{cite book |last=Haugen | first=Mark P. | author2=C.

White lines do not represent the curvature of space but instead represent the [[coordinate system]] imposed on the curved spacetime, which would be [[regular grid|rectilinear]] in a flat spacetime.]]\n{{General relativity sidebar}}\nIn [[general relativity]], the effects of gravitation are ascribed to [[spacetime]] [[curvature]] instead of a force. The starting point for general relativity is the [[equivalence principle]], which equates free fall with inertial motion and describes free-falling inertial objects as being accelerated relative to non-inertial observers on the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.black-holes.org/relativity6.html |title=Gravity and Warped Spacetime |publisher=black-holes.org |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Lecture 20: Black Holes\u2014The Einstein Equivalence Principle |author=Dmitri Pogosyan |url=http://www.ualberta.ca/~pogosyan/teaching/ASTRO_122/lect20/lecture20.html |publisher=University of Alberta |accessdate=2011-10-14}}</ref> In [[Newtonian physics]], however, no such acceleration can occur unless at least one of the objects is being operated on by a force.\n\nEinstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling objects are moving along locally straight paths in curved spacetime. These straight paths are called [[geodesic (general relativity)|geodesics]]. Like Newton's first law of motion, Einstein's theory states that if a force is applied on an object, it would deviate from a geodesic.  For instance, we are no longer following geodesics while standing because the mechanical resistance of the Earth exerts an upward force on us, and we are non-inertial on the ground as a result. This explains why moving along the geodesics in spacetime is considered inertial.\n\nEinstein discovered the [[field equation]]s of general relativity, which relate the presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime and are named after him. The [[Einstein field equations]] are a set of 10 [[simultaneous equations|simultaneous]], [[nonlinear system|non-linear]], [[differential equation]]s. The solutions of the field equations are the components of the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] of spacetime. A metric tensor describes a geometry of spacetime. The geodesic paths for a spacetime are calculated from the metric tensor.\n\n====Solutions====\nNotable solutions of the Einstein field equations include:\n* The [[Schwarzschild solution]], which describes spacetime surrounding a [[Circular symmetry|spherically symmetric]] non-[[rotation|rotating]] uncharged massive object. For compact enough objects, this solution generated a [[black hole]] with a central [[gravitational singularity|singularity]]. For radial distances from the center which are much greater than the [[Schwarzschild radius]], the accelerations predicted by the Schwarzschild solution are practically identical to those predicted by Newton's theory of gravity.\n* The [[Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m metric|Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m solution]], in which the central object has an electrical charge. For charges with a [[geometrized]] length which are less than the geometrized length of the mass of the object, this solution produces black holes with double [[event horizon]]s.\n* The [[Kerr metric|Kerr solution]] for rotating massive objects. This solution also produces black holes with multiple event horizons.\n* The [[Kerr\u2013Newman metric|Kerr-Newman solution]] for charged, rotating massive objects. This solution also produces black holes with multiple event horizons.\n* The [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric|Friedmann-Lema\u00eetre-Robertson-Walker solution]], which predicts the expansion of the [[Universe]].\n\n====Tests====\nThe [[tests of general relativity]] included the following:<ref name=Pauli1958>{{cite book|last=Pauli|first=Wolfgang Ernst|title=Theory of Relativity|date=1958|isbn=978-0-486-64152-2|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|chapter=Part IV.

(Linked file is very large.)</ref>\n\nAssuming the standardized value for g and ignoring air resistance, this means that an object falling freely near the Earth's surface increases its velocity by 9.80665&nbsp;m/s (32.1740&nbsp;ft/s or 22&nbsp;mph) for each second of its descent. Thus, an object starting from rest will attain a velocity of 9.80665&nbsp;m/s (32.1740&nbsp;ft/s) after one second, approximately 19.62&nbsp;m/s (64.4&nbsp;ft/s) after two seconds, and so on, adding 9.80665&nbsp;m/s (32.1740&nbsp;ft/s) to each resulting velocity. Also, again ignoring air resistance, any and all objects, when dropped from the same height, will hit the ground at the same time.\n\nAccording to [[Newton's 3rd law|Newton's 3rd Law]], the Earth itself experiences a [[Newtons|force]] equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to that which it exerts on a falling object.  This means that the Earth also accelerates towards the object until they collide.  Because the mass of the Earth is huge, however, the acceleration imparted to the Earth by this opposite force is negligible in comparison to the object's.  If the object doesn't bounce after it has collided with the Earth, each of them then exerts a repulsive [[contact force]] on the other which effectively balances the attractive force of gravity and prevents further acceleration.\n\nThe force of gravity on Earth is the resultant (vector sum) of two forces:<ref>{{cite book\n|last1 = Hofmann-Wellenhof |first1 = B.\n|last2 = Moritz |first2 = H.\n|title = Physical Geodesy\n|publisher = Springer\n|edition = 2nd\n|isbn = 978-3-211-33544-4\n|year = 2006\n|postscript = . &sect; 2.1: &ldquo;The total force acting on a body at rest on the earth\u2019s surface is the resultant of gravitational force and the centrifugal force of the earth\u2019s rotation and is called gravity.&rdquo;\n}}</ref>  (a) The gravitational attraction in accordance with Newton's universal law of gravitation, and (b) the centrifugal force, which results from the choice of an earthbound, rotating frame of reference.  The force of gravity is the weakest at the equator because of the centrifugal force caused by the Earth's rotation and because points on the equator are furthest from the center of the Earth.  The force of gravity varies with latitude and increases from about 9.780&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> at the Equator to about 9.832&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> at the poles.\n\n===Equations for a falling body near the surface of the Earth===\n{{main article|Equations for a falling body}}\nUnder an assumption of constant gravitational attraction, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] simplifies to ''F'' = ''mg'', where ''m'' is the [[mass]] of the body and ''g'' is a constant vector with an average magnitude of 9.81&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> on Earth. This resulting force is the object's [[weight]]. The acceleration due to gravity is equal to this ''g''. An initially stationary object which is allowed to fall freely under gravity drops a distance which is proportional to the square of the elapsed time. The image on the right, spanning half a second, was captured with a stroboscopic flash at 20 flashes per second. During the first {{frac|20}} of a second the ball drops one unit of distance (here, a unit is about 12&nbsp;mm); by {{frac|2|20}} it has dropped at total of 4 units; by {{frac|3|20}}, 9 units and so on.\n\nUnder the same constant gravity assumptions, the [[potential energy]], ''E<sub>p</sub>'', of a body at height ''h'' is given by ''E<sub>p</sub>'' = ''mgh'' (or ''E<sub>p</sub>'' = ''Wh'', with ''W'' meaning weight). This expression is valid only over small distances ''h'' from the surface of the Earth. Similarly, the expression <math>h = \\tfrac{v^2}{2g}</math> for the maximum height reached by a vertically projected body with initial velocity ''v'' is useful for small heights and small initial velocities only.\n\n===Gravity and astronomy===\n{{Nature timeline}}\n[[File:Milky Way Emerges as Sun Sets over Paranal.jpg|thumb|left|Gravity acts on stars that form our [[Milky Way]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Milky Way Emerges as Sun Sets over Paranal|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1517a/|website=www.eso.org|publisher=European Southern Obseevatory|accessdate=29 April 2015}}</ref>]]\nThe application of Newton's law of gravity has enabled the acquisition of much of the detailed information we have about the planets in the Solar System, the mass of the Sun, and details of [[quasar]]s; even the existence of [[dark matter]] is inferred using Newton's law of gravity. Although we have not traveled to all the planets nor to the Sun, we know their masses. These masses are obtained by applying the laws of gravity to the measured characteristics of the orbit. In space an object maintains its [[orbit]] because of the force of gravity acting upon it. Planets orbit stars, stars orbit [[bulge (astronomy)|galactic center]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]] orbit a center of mass in clusters, and clusters orbit in [[supercluster]]s. The force of gravity exerted on one object by another is directly proportional to the product of those objects' masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.\n\nThe earliest gravity (possibly in the form of [[quantum gravity]], [[supergravity]] or a [[gravitational singularity]]), along with ordinary [[space]] and [[time]], developed during the [[Timeline of the formation of the Universe#Planck Epoch|Planck epoch]] (up to 10<sup>\u221243</sup> seconds after the [[Big Bang|birth]] of the [[Universe]]), possibly from a primeval state (such as a [[false vacuum]], [[quantum vacuum]] or [[virtual particle]]), in a currently unknown manner.<ref name=\"Planck-UOregon\"/>\n\n===Gravitational radiation===\n{{main article|Gravitational wave}}\nAccording to general relativity, gravitational radiation is generated in situations where the curvature of [[spacetime]] is oscillating, such as is the case with co-orbiting objects. The gravitational radiation emitted by the [[Solar System]] is far too small to measure. However, gravitational radiation has been indirectly observed as an energy loss over time in binary pulsar systems such as [[PSR B1913+16]]. It is believed that [[neutron star]] mergers and [[black hole]] formation may create detectable amounts of gravitational radiation. Gravitational radiation observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory ([[LIGO]]) have been created to study the problem. In February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had detected gravitational waves from a black hole collision. On September 14, 2015 LIGO registered gravitational waves for the first time, as a result of the collision of two black holes 1.3 billion light-years from Earth.<ref name='Clark 2016'>{{Cite web|title = Gravitational waves: scientists announce 'we did it!' \u2013 live|url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/live/2016/feb/11/gravitational-wave-announcement-latest-physics-einstein-ligo-black-holes-live|website = the Guardian|date=2016-02-11|access-date = 2016-02-11|first = Stuart|last = Clark}}</ref><ref name=\"Discovery 2016\">{{cite journal |title=Einstein's gravitational waves found at last |journal=Nature News|url=http://www.nature.com/news/einstein-s-gravitational-waves-found-at-last-1.19361 |date=February 11, 2016 |last=Castelvecchi |first=Davide |last2=Witze |first2=Witze |doi=10.1038/nature.2016.19361  |accessdate=2016-02-11 }}</ref> This observation confirms the theoretical predictions of Einstein and others that such waves exist.

Galaxies within [[Galaxy groups and clusters|galaxy clusters]] show a similar pattern. [[Dark matter]], which would interact through gravitation but not electromagnetically, would account for the discrepancy. Various [[Modified Newtonian dynamics|modifications to Newtonian dynamics]] have also been proposed.\n* '''[[Flyby anomaly]]''': Various spacecraft have experienced greater acceleration than expected during [[gravity assist]] maneuvers.\n* '''Accelerating expansion''': The [[metric expansion of space]] seems to be speeding up. [[Dark energy]] has been proposed to explain this. A recent alternative explanation is that the geometry of space is not homogeneous (due to clusters of galaxies) and that when the data are reinterpreted to take this into account, the expansion is not speeding up after all,<ref>[http://space.newscientist.com/channel/astronomy/cosmology/mg19726461.600-dark-energy-may-just-be-a-cosmic-illusion.html Dark energy may just be a cosmic illusion], ''New Scientist'', issue 2646, 7 March 2008.</ref> however this conclusion is disputed.<ref>[http://space.newscientist.com/article/mg20026783.800-swisscheese-model-of-the-cosmos-is-full-of-holes.html Swiss-cheese model of the cosmos is full of holes], ''New Scientist'', issue 2678, 18 October 2008.</ref>\n* '''Anomalous increase of the [[astronomical unit]]''': Recent measurements indicate that [[Astronomical unit#Developments|planetary orbits are widening]] faster than if this were solely through the Sun losing mass by radiating energy.\n* '''Extra energetic photons''': Photons travelling through galaxy clusters should gain energy and then lose it again on the way out. The accelerating expansion of the Universe should stop the photons returning all the energy, but even taking this into account photons from the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] gain twice as much energy as expected.
