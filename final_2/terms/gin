From its earliest origins in the [[Middle Ages]], gin has evolved from a [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]] to an object of commerce in the spirits industry. Gin was developed on the basis of the older [[jenever]], and became popular in Great Britain when [[William III of England|William of Orange]], leader of the [[Dutch Republic]], occupied the English, Scottish and Irish thrones with his wife Mary. Gin is one of the broadest categories of spirits, represented by products of various origins, styles, and flavour profiles that all revolve around juniper as a common ingredient.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''gin'' is a shortened form of the older English word ''genever'', related to the  [[French language|French]] word ''geni\u00e8vre'' and the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''[[jenever]]''. All ultimately derive from ''juniperus'', the Latin for juniper.\n\n==Legal definition==\nAlthough several different styles of gin have evolved, it is legally differentiated into four categories in the European Union, which are described as follows.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{citation |title=E.U.

It must be bottled at a minimum of 30% [[ABV]]. Juniper-flavoured spirit drinks may also be sold under the names [[Wacholder]] or [[Genebra]].\n;Gin\n:This is a juniper-flavoured spirit made not via the redistillation of botanicals, but by simply adding approved natural flavouring substances to a neutral spirit of agricultural origin. The predominant flavour must be juniper.\n;Distilled gin\n:Distilled gin is produced exclusively by redistilling ethanol of agricultural origin with an initial strength of 96% ABV (the [[azeotrope]] of water and [[ethanol]]) in stills traditionally used for gin, in the presence of juniper berries and of other natural botanicals, provided that the juniper taste is predominant. Gin obtained simply by adding essences or flavourings to ethanol of agricultural origin is not distilled gin.\n;London gin\n:London gin is obtained exclusively from ethanol of agricultural origin with a maximum [[methanol]] content of 5&nbsp;grams per hectolitre of 100% ABV equivalent, whose flavour is introduced exclusively through the re-distillation in traditional stills of ethanol in the presence of all the natural plant materials used, the resultant distillate of which is at least 70% ABV. London gin may not contain added sweetening exceeding 0.1&nbsp;grams of sugars per litre of the final product, nor colorants, nor any added ingredients other than water. The term ''London gin'' may be supplemented by the term \"dry\".\n\nIn the EU, the minimum bottled alcoholic strength for gin, distilled gin, and London gin is 37.5% ABV.\n\nIn the United States, gin is defined as an alcoholic beverage of no less than 40% ABV (80 [[Proof (alcohol)|proof]]) that possesses the characteristic flavour of juniper berries. Gin produced\nonly through distillation or redistillation of aromatics with an alcoholic wash can be further distinguished and marketed as \"distilled gin\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{citation |title=Definitions (\"Standards of Identity\") for Distilled Spirits, Title 27 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1, Part 5, Section 5.22 ,(c) Class 3 |url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&rgn=div5&view=text&node=27:1.0.1.1.3&idno=27}}</ref>\n\nSome legal classifications define gin as only originating from specific geographical areas without any further restrictions (e.g. [[Plymouth gin]], [[Ostfriesischer Korngenever]], [[borovi\u010dka|Slovensk\u00e1 borovi\u010dka]], [[brinjevec|Kra\u0161ki Brinjevec]], etc.), while other common descriptors refer to classic styles that are culturally recognized, but not legally defined (e.g., [[sloe gin]], [[Wacholder]] and [[Old Tom gin]]).\n\n==Production methods==\nSeveral different techniques for the production of gin have evolved since its early origins, this evolution being reflective of ongoing modernization in distillation and flavouring techniques. As a result of this evolution, gins can be broadly differentiated into three basic styles.<ref name=HAB>{{citation |title=Handbook of Alcoholic Beverages: Technical, Analytical and Nutritional Aspects |first=Alan J. |last=Buglass |chapter=3.4 |year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. |isbn=978-0-470-51202-9}}</ref>\n*'''Pot distilled gin''' represents the earliest style of gin, and is traditionally produced by pot distilling a fermented grain mash (malt wine) from [[barley]] and or other grains, then redistilling it with flavouring botanicals to extract the aromatic compounds. A ''double gin'' can be produced by redistilling the first gin again with more botanicals. Due to the use of pot stills, the alcohol content of the distillate is relatively low; around 68% ABV for a single distilled gin or 76% ABV for a double gin. This type of gin is often aged in tanks or wooden casks, and retains a heavier, malty flavour that gives it a marked resemblance to whisky. ''Korenwijn'' (grain wine) and the ''oude'' (old) style of ''Geneva gin'' or ''Holland gin'' represent the most prominent gins of this class.<ref name=HAB/>\n*'''Column distilled gin''' evolved following the invention of the [[Coffey still]], and is produced by first distilling high proof (e.g. 96% ABV) [[Rectified spirit|neutral spirits]] from a fermented mash or wash using a refluxing still such as a [[Fractionating column|column still]]. The fermentable base for this spirit may be derived from grain, [[sugar beet]]s, [[grape]]s, [[potato]]es, [[sugar cane]], plain sugar, or any other material of agricultural origin. The highly concentrated spirit is then redistilled with juniper berries and other botanicals in a pot still. Most often, the botanicals are suspended in a \"gin basket\" positioned within the head of the still, which allows the hot alcoholic vapours to extract flavouring components from the botanical charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homedistiller.org/equip/designs/gin|title=Home Distillation of Alcohol (Homemade Alcohol to Drink)|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> This method yields a gin lighter in flavour than the older pot still method, and results in either a ''distilled gin'' or ''London dry gin'',<ref name=HAB/> depending largely upon how the spirit is finished.\n*'''Compound gin''' is made by simply flavouring neutral spirits with essences and/or other 'natural flavourings' without redistillation, and is not as highly regarded as distilled gin.<ref name=HAB/>\n\nPopular botanicals and/or flavouring agents for gin, besides the required juniper, often include citrus elements, such as lemon and [[bitter orange]] peel, as well as a combination of other spices, which may include any of [[anise]], [[angelica]] root and seed, [[orris root]], [[licorice]] root, [[cinnamon]], almond, [[cubeb]], [[Satureja|savory]], [[lime (fruit)|lime]] peel, [[grapefruit]] peel, dragon eye, [[saffron]], [[baobab]], [[frankincense]], [[coriander]], [[Aframomum melegueta|grains of paradise]], [[nutmeg]], [[Cinnamomum aromaticum|cassia]] bark, and/or others.\n\n==History==\nThe Dutch physician [[Franciscus Sylvius]] is often falsely credited with the invention of gin in the mid 17th century,<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.bluecoatgin.com/history_orgins.html |title=Origins of Gin |accessdate=5 April 2009 |publisher=Bluecoat American Dry Gin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213205501/http://bluecoatgin.com/history_orgins.html |archivedate=13 February 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.tasteoftx.com/spirits/gin.html|title=Gin|accessdate=5 April 2009|publisher=tasteoftx.com}}</ref> although the existence of genever is confirmed in [[Philip Massinger]]'s play ''[[The Duke of Milan]]'' (1623), when Sylvius would have been about nine years old. It is further claimed that English soldiers who provided support in [[Antwerp, Belgium|Antwerp]] against the Spanish in 1585, during the [[Eighty Years' War]], were already drinking genever for its calming effects before battle, from which the term ''Dutch Courage'' is believed to have originated.<ref>{{citation |title=Genever: 500 Years of History in a Bottle |last=Van Acker - Beittel |first=Veronique |isbn=0-615-79585-4 |publisher=Flemish Lion}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest known written reference to genever appears in the 13th century encyclopaedic work ''Der Naturen Bloeme'' ([[Bruges, Belgium|Bruges]]), with the earliest printed recipe for genever dating from 16th century work ''Een Constelijck Distileerboec'' (Antwerp).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.Belgiangenever.com|title=www.Belgiangenever.com&#93;|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:William Hogarth - Gin Lane.jpg|thumb|Hogarth's ''[[Gin Lane]]'' (created 1750-51)]]\n[[File:The Gin shop - Cruikshank, Scraps and sketches (1829), f.9 - BL.jpg|thumb|[[George Cruikshank|Cruikshank]]'s engraving of The Gin Shop (1829)]]\nBy the mid 17th century, numerous small Dutch and Flemish distillers (some 400 in Amsterdam alone by 1663) had popularized the re-distillation of malt spirit or malt wine with juniper, [[anise]], [[caraway]], [[coriander]], etc.,<ref>{{cite book |first=R.

Gin emerged in England in varying forms as of the early 17th century, and at the time of [[the Restoration]], enjoyed a brief resurgence. When [[William III of England|William of Orange]], ruler of the [[Dutch Republic]], occupied the British throne with his wife Mary in what has become known as the [[Glorious Revolution]], gin became vastly more popular,<ref name=\"nb\">{{cite book|last=Brownlee|first=Nick|title=This is alcohol|publisher=Sanctuary Publishing|year=2002|pages=84\u201393|chapter=3 \u2013 History|isbn=1-86074-422-2}}</ref> particularly in crude, inferior forms, where it was more likely to be flavoured with [[turpentine]]<ref name=\"Gin definition\">{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=246150|title=Gin (definition)|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> as an alternative to juniper.\n\nGin drinking in England rose significantly after the Government allowed unlicensed gin production and at the same time imposed a heavy [[duty (economics)|duty]] on all imported spirits. This created a market for poor-quality grain that was unfit for brewing [[beer]], and thousands of gin-shops sprang up throughout England, a period known as the [[Gin Craze]]. Because of the relative price of gin, when compared with other drinks available at the same time and in the same geographic location, gin began to be consumed regularly by the poor.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Complete English Tradesman: In Familiar Letters; Directing Him in All the Several Parts and Progressions of Trade ...

Beer maintained a healthy reputation as it was often safer to drink the brewed ale than unclean plain water. Gin, though, was blamed for various social problems, and it may have been a factor in the higher death rates which stabilized London's previously growing population.<ref name=\"nb\" /> The reputation of the two drinks was illustrated by [[William Hogarth]] in his engravings ''[[Beer Street and Gin Lane]]'' (1751), described by the [[BBC]] as \"arguably the most potent anti-drug poster ever conceived.\"<ref name=finlo>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-28486017|title=When gin was full of sulphuric acid and turpentine|author=Finlo Rohrer|date=28 July 2014|accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref> The negative reputation of gin survives today in the English language, in terms like \"gin mills\" or the American phrase \"gin joints\" to describe disreputable bars, or \"gin-soaked\" to refer to drunks. The epithet \"mother's ruin\" is a common British name for gin, the origin of which is the subject of ongoing debate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Origin of the phrase \"mother's ruin?\"|url=https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/163917/origin-of-the-phrase-mothers-ruin|website=English Language and Usage|accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Gin Craze|Gin Act 1736]] imposed high taxes on retailers and led to riots in the streets. The prohibitive duty was gradually reduced and finally abolished in 1742. The [[Gin Act 1751]] was more successful, however; it forced distillers to sell only to licensed retailers and brought gin shops under the jurisdiction of local magistrates.<ref name=\"nb\" /> Gin in the 18th century was produced in [[pot still]]s, and was somewhat sweeter than the London gin known today.\n\nIn London in the early 18th century, much gin was distilled legally in residential houses (there were estimated to be 1,500 residential stills in 1726) and was often flavoured with turpentine to generate resinous woody notes in addition to the juniper.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/history/0,6121,725676,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Distil my beating heart | date=1 June 2002|accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref> As late as 1913, ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' states without further comment, \" 'common gin' is usually flavoured with turpentine\".<ref name=\"Gin definition\"/>\n\nAnother common variation was to distill in the presence of [[sulphuric acid]]. Although the acid itself does not distil, it imparts the additional aroma of [[diethyl ether]] to the resulting gin. Sulphuric acid subtracts one water molecule from two ethanol molecules to create [[diethyl ether]], which also forms an [[azeotrope]] with ethanol, and therefore distils with it. The result is a sweeter spirit, and one that may have possessed additional analgesic or even intoxicating effects \u2013 see [[Paracelsus]].\n\nDutch or Belgian gin, also known as ''[[jenever]]'' or ''genever'', evolved from malt wine spirits, and is a distinctly different drink from later styles of gin. [[Schiedam]], a city in the province of [[South Holland]], is famous for its ''jenever''-producing history. The ''oude'' (old) style of ''jenever'' remained very popular throughout the 19th century, where it was referred to as \"Holland\" or \"Geneva\" gin in popular, American, pre-Prohibition bartender guides.<ref>Johnson, Harry; \"Harry Johnson's New and Improved Bartender's Manual; 1900.\";</ref>\n\nThe 19th century gave rise to a style of gin referred to as ''[[Old Tom Gin]]'', which is a softer, sweeter style of gin, often containing sugar. Old Tom gin faded in popularity by the early 20th century.\n\nThe invention and development of the [[column still]] (1826\u201331)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stillcooker.com/patent-still.php|title=Coffey still \u2013 Patent Still \u2013 Column Still: a continuous distillation|publisher=StillCooker & Friends|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref> made the distillation of neutral spirits practical, thus enabling the creation of the \"London dry\" style that evolved later in the 19th century.\n\nIn tropical British colonies gin was used to mask the bitter flavour of [[quinine]], which was the only effective anti-malarial compound. Quinine was dissolved in carbonated water to form [[tonic water]]; the resulting cocktail is [[gin and tonic]], although modern tonic water contains only a trace of quinine as a flavouring. Gin is a common base spirit for many [[mixed drinks]], including the [[martini cocktail|martini]]. Secretly produced \"[[bathtub gin]]\" was available in the [[speakeasy|speakeasies]] and \"[[blind pig]]s\" of [[Prohibition]]-era America as a result of the relative simple production.\n\n[[Sloe gin]] is traditionally described as a liqueur made by infusing [[Blackthorn|sloe]]s (the fruit of the blackthorn) in gin, although modern versions are almost always compounded from neutral spirits and flavourings. Similar infusions are possible with other fruits, such as [[damson]]s<ref>{{citation|url=http://averelldamsongin.com/|title=Averell Damson Gin Liqueur|accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref> or beach plums.<ref>{{citation|url=http://greenhookgin.com/plum.html |title=Greenhook Gimsmiths |accessdate=8 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719080643/http://greenhookgin.com/plum.html |archivedate=19 July 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe National Jenever Museums are located in [[Hasselt]], Belgium, and Schiedam, the Netherlands.\n\nSince 2009 the second Saturday in June has been designated as World Gin Day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldginday.com |title=World Gin Day |publisher=World Gin Day |date=13 June 2015 |accessdate=17 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Classic gin cocktails ==\nA well known gin cocktail is the [[Martini (cocktail)|martini]], traditionally made with gin and [[vermouth|dry vermouth]].
