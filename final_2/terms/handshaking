It follows the physical establishment of the channel and precedes normal information transfer.\n\nThe handshaking process usually takes place in order to establish rules for communication when a [[computer]] sets about communicating with a foreign device. When a computer communicates with another device like a modem, printer, or network server, it needs to handshake with it to establish a connection.\n\nHandshaking can negotiate parameters that are acceptable to equipment and systems at both ends of the communication channel, including [[bit rate|information transfer rate]], coding [[alphabet]], [[parity bit|parity]], [[interrupt]] procedure, and other [[protocol (computing)|protocol]] or hardware features.\nHandshaking is a technique of communication between two entities. However, within TCP/IP RFCs, the term \"handshake\" is most commonly used to reference the TCP three-way handshake. For example, the term \"handshake\" is not present in RFCs covering FTP or SMTP. One exception is Transport Layer Security, TLS, setup, FTP RFC 4217. In place of the term \"handshake\", FTP RFC 3659 substitutes the term \"conversation\" for the passing of commands.<ref>TCP\nRFC 793, 2581</ref><ref>SMTP RFC 821,5321, 2821, 1869,6531, 2822</ref><ref>FTP 959, 3659 (conversation), 2228,4217 (TLS handshake),5797</ref>\n\nA simple handshaking protocol might only involve the receiver sending a message meaning \"I received your last message and I am ready for you to send me another one.\" A more complex handshaking protocol might allow the sender to ask the receiver if it is ready to receive or for the receiver to reply with a negative acknowledgement meaning \"I did not receive your last message correctly, please resend it\" (e.g., if the data was corrupted en route).<ref>\n{{cite web |title= handshaking |url= http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Hand+shake+signal \n| website = TheFreeDictionary's Encyclopedia}}\n</ref>\n\nHandshaking facilitates connecting relatively heterogeneous systems or equipment over a communication channel without the need for human intervention to set parameters. \n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== TCP three-way handshake ===\n[[File:Three-way-handshake-example.gif|thumbnail|right|500px|Example of three way handshaking]]\nEstablishing a normal [[Transmission Control Protocol#Connection establishment|TCP]] connection requires three separate steps:\n:# The first host (Alice) sends the second host (Bob) a \"synchronize\" (SYN) message with its own sequence number <math>x</math>, which Bob receives.\n:# Bob replies with a synchronize-acknowledgment ([[SYN-ACK]]) message with its own sequence number <math>y</math> and acknowledgement number <math>x + 1</math>, which Alice receives.\n:# Alice replies with an acknowledgment message with acknowledgement number <math>y + 1</math>, which Bob receives and to which he doesn't need to reply.\n: In this setup, the synchronize messages act as service requests from one server to the other, while the acknowledgement messages return to the requesting server to let it know the message was received.\n\nOne of the most important factors of three-way handshake is that, in order to exchange the starting sequence number the two sides plan to use, the client first sends a segment with its own initial sequence number <math>x</math>, then the server responds by sending a segment with its own sequence number <math>y</math> and the acknowledgement number <math>x + 1</math>, and finally the client responds by sending a segment with acknowledgement number <math>y + 1</math>.\n\nThe reason for the client and server not using the default sequence number such as 0 for establishing connection is to protect against two incarnations of the same connection reusing the same sequence number too soon, which means a segment from an earlier incarnation of a connection might interfere with a later incarnation of the connection.\n\n=== SMTP ===\nThe [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP) is the key Internet standard for email transmission. It [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol#SMTP transport example|includes handshaking]] to negotiate authentication, encryption and maximum message size. \n\n=== TLS handshake ===\n{{Main|Transport Layer Security#TLS handshake}}\nWhen a [[Transport Layer Security]] (SSL or TLS) connection starts, the record encapsulates a \"control\" protocol\u2014the handshake messaging protocol  (content type 22). This protocol is used to exchange all the information required by both sides for the exchange of the actual application data by TLS. It defines the messages formatting or containing this information and the order of their exchange. These may vary according to the demands of the client and server\u2014i.e., there are several possible procedures to set up the connection. This initial exchange results in a successful TLS connection (both parties ready to transfer application data with TLS) or an alert message (as specified below).\n\nThe protocol is used to negotiate the secure attributes of a session.

The \"squealing\" (which is actually a sound that changes in pitch 100 times every second) noises made by some modems with speaker output immediately after a connection is established are in fact the sounds of modems at both ends engaging in a handshaking procedure; once the procedure is completed, the speaker might be silenced, depending on the settings of operating system or the application controlling the modem.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Data transmission]]\n[[Category:Network architecture]]\n[[Category:Network protocols]]\n\n[[de:Datenflusssteuerung]]"}]}}}}
