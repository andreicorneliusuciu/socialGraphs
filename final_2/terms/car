In that year, German inventor [[Karl Benz]] built the [[Benz Patent-Motorwagen]]. Cars did not become widely available until the early 20th century. One of the first cars that was accessible to the masses was the 1908 [[Ford Model T|Model T]], an American car manufactured by the [[Ford Motor Company]]. Cars were rapidly adopted in the United States of America, where they replaced [[Draft animal|animal-drawn]] [[carriage]]s and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.\n\nCars are equipped with controls used for driving, parking, passenger comfort and safety, and controlling a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. Examples include rear reversing cameras, [[Automobile air conditioning|air conditioning]], [[Automotive navigation system|navigation systems]], and [[in car entertainment]]. Most cars in use in the 2010s are propelled by an [[internal combustion engine]], fueled by [[deflagration]] of [[gasoline]] (also known as petrol) or [[Diesel fuel|diesel]].

It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods, and was of little practical use.\n\nThe development of external combustion engines is detailed as part of the [[history of the car]], but often treated separately from the development of true cars.  A variety of steam-powered road vehicles were used during the first part of the 19th century, including [[steam car]]s, [[steam bus]]es, [[phaeton (carriage)|phaetons]], and [[steam roller]]s.  Sentiment against them led to the [[Locomotive Acts]] of 1865.\n\nIn 1807, [[Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce]] and his brother Claude created what was probably the world's first [[internal combustion engine]] (which they called a [[Pyr\u00e9olophore]]), but they chose to install it in a boat on the river [[Saone]] in France.<ref name=\"NieMus\">{{cite web|author=speos.fr |url=http://niepce.house.museum/pagus/pagus-other.html |title=Niepce Museum, Other Inventions |publisher=Niepce.house.museum |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> Coincidentally, in 1807 the Swiss inventor [[Fran\u00e7ois Isaac de Rivaz]] designed his own '[[De Rivaz engine|de Rivaz internal combustion engine]]' and used it to develop the world's first vehicle to be powered by such an engine. The Ni\u00e9pces' Pyr\u00e9olophore was fuelled by a mixture of [[Lycopodium powder]] (dried spores of the [[Lycopodium]] plant), finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil, whereas de Rivaz used a mixture of [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]].<ref name=\"NieMus\"/> Neither design was very successful, as was the case with others, such as [[Samuel Brown (engineer)|Samuel Brown]], [[Samuel Morey]], and [[Etienne Lenoir]] with his [[Hippomobile (car)|hippomobile]], who each produced vehicles (usually adapted carriages or carts) powered by internal combustion engines.<ref name=stein>{{cite book|title=The Automobile Book |publisher=Paul Hamlyn | year=1967 |first=Ralph |last=Stein}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Capture d\u2019\u00e9cran 2016-10-14 \u00e0 21.26.28.png|thumb|[[Gustave Trouv\u00e9]]'s tricycle, the first ever electric automobile to be shown in public]]\n\nIn November 1881, French inventor [[Gustave Trouv\u00e9]] demonstrated the first working (three-wheeled) car powered by electricity at the [[International Exposition of Electricity, Paris]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wakefield |first=Ernest H. |title=History of the Electric Automobile |publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers |year=1994 |isbn=1-56091-299-5 |pages=2\u20133}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Carl-Benz coloriert.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Karl Benz]], the inventor of the modern car]]\n\nAlthough several other German engineers (including [[Gottlieb Daimler]], [[Wilhelm Maybach]], and [[Siegfried Marcus]]) were working on the problem at about the same time, [[Karl Benz]] generally is acknowledged as the inventor of the modern car.<ref name=stein />\n\n[[File:1885Benz.jpg|right|thumb|A photograph of the original [[Benz Patent-Motorwagen]], first built in 1885 and awarded the patent for the concept]]\n\nIn 1879, Benz was granted a patent for his first engine, which had been designed in 1878. Many of his other inventions made the use of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle. His first ''[[Benz Patent Motorwagen|Motorwagen]]'' was built in 1885 in [[Mannheim]], Germany. He was awarded the patent for its invention as of his application on 29 January 1886 (under the auspices of his major company, [[Benz & Cie.]], which was founded in 1883). Benz began promotion of the vehicle on 3 July 1886, and about 25 Benz vehicles were sold between 1888 and 1893, when his first four-wheeler was introduced along with a model intended for affordability. They also were powered with [[Four-stroke cycle|four-stroke]] engines of his own design. [[Emile Roger]] of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to his line of products. Because France was more open to the early cars, initially more were built and sold in France through Roger than Benz sold in Germany. In August 1888 [[Bertha Benz]], the wife of Karl Benz, undertook the first [[road trip]] by car, to prove the road-worthiness of her husband's invention.\n\n[[File:Berthabenzportrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Bertha Benz]], the first long distance car driver in the world]]\n\nIn 1896, Benz designed and patented the first internal-combustion [[flat engine]], called ''boxermotor''. During the last years of the nineteenth century, Benz was the largest car company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899 and, because of its size, Benz & Cie., became a [[joint-stock company]].\n\nThe first motor car in central Europe and one of the first factory-made cars in the world, was produced by [[Czech lands|Czech]] company Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau (later renamed to [[Tatra (company)|Tatra]]) in 1897, the [[Pr\u00e4sident]] automobil.\n\nDaimler and Maybach founded [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]] (DMG) in [[Cannstatt]] in 1890, and sold their first car in 1892 under the brand name ''Daimler''. It was a horse-drawn stagecoach built by another manufacturer, which they retrofitted with an engine of their design. By 1895 about 30 vehicles had been built by Daimler and Maybach, either at the Daimler works or in the Hotel Hermann, where they set up shop after disputes with their backers. Benz, Maybach and the Daimler team seem to have been unaware of each other's early work. They never worked together; by the time of the merger of the two companies, Daimler and Maybach were no longer part of DMG.\n\nDaimler died in 1900 and later that year, Maybach designed an engine named ''Daimler-Mercedes'' that was placed in a specially ordered model built to specifications set by [[Emil Jellinek]]. This was a production of a small number of vehicles for Jellinek to race and market in his country. Two years later, in 1902, a new model DMG car was produced and the model was named Mercedes after the Maybach engine, which generated 35&nbsp;hp. Maybach quit DMG shortly thereafter and opened a business of his own. Rights to the ''Daimler'' brand name were sold to other manufacturers.\n\nKarl Benz proposed co-operation between DMG and Benz & Cie. when economic conditions began to deteriorate in Germany following the [[First World War]], but the directors of DMG refused to consider it initially. Negotiations between the two companies resumed several years later when these conditions worsened and, in 1924 they signed an Agreement of Mutual Interest, valid until the year 2000. Both enterprises standardized design, production, purchasing, and sales and they advertised or marketed their car models jointly, although keeping their respective brands. On 28 June 1926, Benz & Cie. and DMG finally merged as the Daimler-Benz company, baptizing all of its cars Mercedes Benz, as a brand honoring the most important model of the DMG cars, the Maybach design later referred to as the 1902 Mercedes-35&nbsp;hp, along with the Benz name. Karl Benz remained a member of the board of directors of Daimler-Benz until his death in 1929, and at times his two sons also participated in the management of the company.\n\n[[File:\u00c9mile Levassor.jpg|thumb|\u00c9mile Levassor]]\n[[File:Armand Peugeot.jpg|thumb|Armand Peugeot]]\n\nIn 1890, [[\u00c9mile Levassor]] and [[Armand Peugeot]] of [[France]] began producing vehicles with Daimler engines, and so laid the foundation of the [[Automotive industry in France#1900 to 1950|automotive industry in France]]. In 1891, [[Auguste Doriot]] and his Peugeot colleague Louis Rigoulot completed the longest trip by a gasoline-powered vehicle when their self-designed and built Daimler powered [[Peugeot Type 3]] completed {{convert|2100|km|mi|abbr=in|-1}} from [[Valentigney]] to Paris and Brest and back again. They were attached to the first [[Paris\u2013Brest\u2013Paris]] bicycle race, but finished 6 days after the winning cyclist, [[Charles Terront]].\n\nThe first design for an American car with a gasoline internal combustion engine was made in 1877 by [[George Baldwin Selden|George Selden]] of [[Rochester, New York]]. Selden applied for a patent for a car in 1879, but the patent application expired because the vehicle was never built. After a delay of sixteen years and a series of attachments to his application, on 5 November 1895, Selden was granted a United States patent ({{US patent|549160}}) for a [[two-stroke cycle|two-stroke]] car engine, [[George B. Selden#The Selden patent|which hindered, more than encouraged]], development of cars in the United States. His patent was challenged by [[Henry Ford]] and others, and overturned in 1911.\n\nIn 1893, the first running, gasoline-powered [[Automotive industry in the United States|American car]] was built and road-tested by the [[Duryea brothers]] of [[Springfield, Massachusetts]].

Only [[Japan Black]] would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1913, until fast-drying [[Duco]] [[lacquer]] was developed in 1926. This is the source of Ford's [[apocryphal]] remark, \"any color as long as it's black\".<ref name=Georgano/> In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months' pay.<ref name=Georgano/>\n\nFord's complex safety procedures\u2014especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about\u2014dramatically reduced the rate of injury. The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called \"[[Fordism]],\" and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the economic rise of the United States. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods.\n\nIn the automotive industry, its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide seeing the founding of Ford France and Ford Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany 1925; in 1921, [[Citroen]] was the first native European manufacturer to adopt the production method. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke; by 1930, 250 companies which did not, had disappeared.<ref name=Georgano/>\n\nDevelopment of automotive technology was rapid, due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world's attention. Key developments included electric [[ignition system|ignition]] and the electric self-starter (both by [[Charles Kettering]], for the [[Cadillac]] Motor Company in 1910\u20131911), independent [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], and four-wheel brakes.\n\nSince the 1920s, nearly all cars have been mass-produced to meet market needs, so marketing plans often have heavily influenced car design. It was [[Alfred P. Sloan]] who established the idea of different makes of cars produced by one company, called the [[General Motors Companion Make Program]], so that buyers could \"move up\" as their fortunes improved.\n\nReflecting the rapid pace of change, makes shared parts with one another so larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range. For example, in the 1930s, [[LaSalle (automobile)|LaSalle]]s, sold by [[Cadillac]], used cheaper mechanical parts made by [[Oldsmobile]]; in the 1950s, [[Chevrolet]] shared hood, doors, roof, and windows with [[Pontiac]]; by the 1990s, corporate [[powertrain]]s and shared [[Automobile platform|platforms]] (with interchangeable [[brake]]s, suspension, and other parts) were common. Even so, only major makers could afford high costs, and even companies with decades of production, such as [[Apperson]], [[Cole Motor Car Company|Cole]], [[Dorris Motors Corporation|Dorris]], [[Haynes Automobile Company|Haynes]], or [[Premier (U.S. car)|Premier]], could not manage: of some two hundred American car makers in existence in 1920, only 43 survived in 1930, and with the [[Great Depression]], by 1940, only 17 of those were left.<ref name=Georgano/>\n\nIn Europe much the same would happen. [[Morris Motors|Morris]] set up its production line at [[Cowley, Oxford|Cowley]] in 1924, and soon outsold Ford, while beginning in 1923 to follow Ford's practice of [[vertical integration]], buying [[Hotchkiss (car)|Hotchkiss]] (engines), [[EG Wrigley and Company|Wrigley]] (gearboxes), and Osberton (radiators), for instance, as well as competitors, such as [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]]: in 1925, Morris had 41% of total British car production. Most British small-car assemblers, from [[Abbey (1922 automobile)|Abbey]] to [[Xtra (automobile)|Xtra]], had gone under. Citroen did the same in France, coming to cars in 1919; between them and other cheap cars in reply such as [[Renault]]'s [[Renault 10CV|10CV]] and [[Peugeot]]'s [[Peugeot 5CV|5CV]], they produced 550,000 cars in 1925, and [[Mors (automobile)|Mors]], [[Hurtu]], and others could not compete.<ref name=Georgano/> Germany's first mass-manufactured car, the [[Opel]] [[Opel Laubfrosch|4PS ''Laubfrosch'']] (Tree Frog), came off the line at [[Russelsheim]] in 1924, soon making Opel the top car builder in Germany, with 37.5% of the market.<ref name=Georgano/>\n\nIn Japan, car production was very limited before World War II. Only a handful of companines were producing vehicles in limited numbers, and the vehicles were small, and three-wheeled for commercial uses, like [[Daihatsu]], or were the result of partnering with European companies, like [[Isuzu Motors|Isuzu]] building the [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley A-9]] in 1922. [[Mitsubishi]] was also partnered with [[Fiat S.p.A.|Fiat]] and built the [[Mitsubishi Model A]] based on a Fiat vehicle. [[Toyota]], [[Nissan]], [[Suzuki]], [[Mazda]], and [[Honda]] began as companies producing non-automotive products before the war, switching to car production during the 1950s. Kiichiro Toyoda's decision to take [[Toyoda Loom Works]] into automobile manufacturing would create what would eventually become [[Toyota Motor Corporation]], the largest automobile manufacturer in the world. [[Subaru]], meanwhile, was formed from a conglomerate of six companies who banded together as [[Fuji Heavy Industries]], as a result of having been broken up under ''[[keiretsu]]'' legislation.\n\n==Fuel and propulsion technologies==\n[[File:2011 Nissan Leaf SL -- 10-28-2011.jpg|thumb|The [[Nissan Leaf]] is an all-[[electric car]] launched in December 2010]]\n{{See also|Alternative fuel vehicle}}\nMost cars in use today are propelled by an [[internal combustion engine]], fueled by [[deflagration]] of [[gasoline]] or [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]. Both fuels are known to cause air pollution and are also blamed for contributing to [[climate change]] and [[global warming]].<ref name=\"Global Climate Change\"/> Rapidly increasing [[2000s energy crisis|oil prices]], concerns about [[energy security|oil dependence]], tightening environmental laws and restrictions on [[greenhouse gas]] emissions are propelling work on alternative power systems for cars. Efforts to improve or replace existing technologies include the development of [[hybrid vehicle]]s, [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s and [[hydrogen vehicle]]s. Vehicles using [[alternative fuel]]s such as [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s and [[natural gas vehicle]]s are also gaining popularity in some countries. Cars for racing or [[land speed record|speed records]] have sometimes employed [[jet car|jet]] or [[rocket car|rocket]] engines, but these are impractical for common use.\n\n[[Oil consumption]] in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries has been abundantly pushed by car growth; the [[1980s oil glut|1985\u20132003 oil glut]] even fuelled the sales of low-economy vehicles in [[OECD]] countries. The [[BRIC]] countries are adding to this consumption; in December 2009 China was briefly the largest car market.<ref name=China-market>\n{{cite news\n  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7879372.stm\n  |title=China's car industry overtakes US\n  |author=Chris Hogg\n  |date=2009-02-10\n  |work=BBC News\n}}</ref>\n\n==User interface==\n{{See also|Car controls}}\n[[File:1923 Ford Model T UPS interior.jpg|thumb|right|In the [[Ford Model T]] the left-side hand lever sets the rear wheel parking brakes and puts the transmission in neutral.

The left foot pedal changes the two forward gears while the centre pedal controls reverse. The right pedal is the brake.]]\n\nCars are equipped with controls used for driving, passenger comfort and safety, normally operated by a combination of the use of feet and hands, and occasionally by voice on 2000s-era cars. These controls include a [[steering wheel]], pedals for operating the brakes and controlling the car's speed (and, in a manual transmission car, a clutch pedal), a shift lever or stick for changing gears, and a number of buttons and dials for turning on lights, ventilation and other functions. Modern cars' controls are now standardised, such as the location for the accelerator and brake, but this was not always the case. Controls are evolving in response to new technologies, for example the [[electric car]] and the integration of mobile communications.\n\nSince the car was first invented, its controls have become fewer and simpler through automation. For example, all cars once had a manual controls for the choke valve, clutch, [[ignition timing]], and a crank instead of an electric [[Starter (engine)|starter]]. However new controls have also been added to vehicles, making them more complex. Examples include [[Automobile air conditioning|air conditioning]], [[Automotive navigation system|navigation systems]], and [[in car entertainment]]. Another trend is the replacement of physical knob and switches for secondary controls with touchscreen controls such as [[BMW]]'s [[iDrive]] and [[Ford]]'s [[MyFord Touch]]. Another change is that while early cars' pedals were physically linked to the brake mechanism and throttle, in the 2010s, cars have increasingly replaced these physical linkages with electronic controls.\n\n==Lighting==\n{{main article|Automotive lighting}}\n[[File:LED DaytimeRunningLights.jpg|thumb|LED [[daytime running lights]] on an [[Audi A4]]]]\nCars are typically fitted with multiple types of lights. These include [[headlight]]s, which are used to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, [[daytime running lights]]; red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-coloured reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., side marker lights) to increase the visibility of the car. Interior lights on the ceiling of the car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a trunk light and, more rarely, an engine compartment light.\n\n==Weight==\n[[File:Smart Fortwo passion front.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[Smart Fortwo]] car from 1998-2002, weighing {{convert|730|kg|lb|abbr=on|0)}}]]\n[[File:07-08 Chevrolet Suburban LT.jpg|thumb|Right|200px|A [[Chevrolet Suburban]] extended-length SUV weighs {{convert|7,200|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip|-2}} (gross weight)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edmunds.com/chevrolet/suburban/2008/features-specs/ |title=Used 2008 Chevrolet Suburban Features & Specs |work=Edmunds |accessdate=2015-11-25}}</ref>]]\n\nIn the United States, \"from 1975 to 1980, average [car] weight dropped from {{convert|4060 to 3228|lb|kg|abbr=on|0|order=flip}}, likely in response to rising gasoline prices\" and new fuel efficiency standards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nber.org/digest/nov11/w17170.html |title=Vehicle Weight and Automotive Fatalities |work=The National Bureau of Economic Research |location=US |accessdate=2015-11-25}}</ref> The average new car weighed {{convert|3221|lb|kg|abbr=on|0|order=flip}} in 1987 but {{convert|4009|lb|kg|abbr=on|0|order=flip}} in 2010, due to modern steel safety cages, anti-lock brakes, airbags, and \"more-powerful\u2014if more-efficient\u2014engines.\"<ref name=killing>{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2011/06/your_big_car_is_killing_me.html |title=Your Big Car Is Killing Me |first=Annie |last=Lowrey |work=Slate |date=2011-06-27 |accessdate=2015-11-25}}</ref> Heavier cars are safer for the driver, from an accident perspective, but more dangerous for other vehicles and road users.<ref name=killing/> The weight of a car influences fuel consumption and performance, with more weight resulting in increased fuel consumption and decreased performance.
