These '''viral particles''', also known as '''virions''', consist of two or three parts: (i) the [[genetic material]] made from either [[DNA]] or [[RNA]], long [[molecule]]s that carry genetic information; (ii) a [[protein]] coat, called the [[capsid]], which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an [[viral envelope|envelope]] of [[lipid]]s that surrounds the protein coat when they are outside a cell. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple [[helix|helical]] and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] forms for some virus species to more complex structures for others. Most virus species have virions that are too small to be seen with an [[optical microscope]]. The average virion is about one one-hundredth the size of the average [[bacterium]].\n\nThe origins of viruses in the [[evolutionary history of life]] are unclear: some may have [[evolution|evolved]] from [[plasmid]]s\u2014pieces of DNA that can move between cells\u2014while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of [[horizontal gene transfer]], which increases [[genetic diversity]].<ref name=\"Canchaya\" /> Viruses are considered by some to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through [[natural selection]]. However they lack key characteristics (such as cell structure) that are generally considered necessary to count as life. Because they possess some but not all such qualities, viruses have been described as \"organisms at the edge of life\",<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{vcite journal|author = Rybicki, EP|year = 1990|title = The classification of organisms at the edge of life, or problems with virus systematics|journal = S Afr J Sci|volume = 86|pages = 182\u2013186}}</ref> and as replicators.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Are viruses alive?

These [[disease]]-bearing organisms are known as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]. [[influenza|Influenza viruses]] are spread by coughing and sneezing. [[Norovirus]] and [[rotavirus]], common causes of viral [[gastroenteritis]], are transmitted by the [[fecal\u2013oral route|faecal\u2013oral route]] and are passed from person to person by contact, entering the body in food or water. [[HIV]] is one of several viruses transmitted through [[Sexual intercourse|sexual contact]] and by exposure to infected blood. The range of host cells that a virus can infect is called its \"[[Host specificity|host range]]\". This can be narrow, meaning a virus is capable of infecting few species, or broad, meaning it is capable of infecting many.<ref>Shors pp. 49\u201350</ref>\n\nViral infections in animals provoke an [[immune response]] that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses can also be produced by [[vaccine]]s, which confer an [[immunity (medical)|artificially acquired immunity]] to the specific viral infection. However, some viruses including those that cause [[AIDS]] and [[viral hepatitis]] evade these immune responses and result in [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] infections. [[Antibiotics]] have no effect on viruses, but several [[antiviral drug]]s have been developed.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word is from the [[Latin]] neuter ''v\u012brus'' referring to [[poison]] and other noxious liquids, from 'the same Indo-European base as Sanskrit ''vi\u1e63a'' poison, Avestan ''v\u012b\u0161a'' poison, ancient Greek ''\u1f30\u03cc\u03c2'' poison', first attested in English in 1398 in [[John Trevisa|John Trevisa's]] translation of [[Bartholomeus Anglicus|Bartholomeus Anglicus's]] ''De Proprietatibus Rerum''.<ref>\"virus, n.\" OED Online.

Thus, he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution.<ref>Shors pp. 76\u201377</ref> In 1892, the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study what is now known as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]]. His experiments showed that crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration. Ivanovsky suggested the infection might be caused by a [[toxin]] produced by bacteria, but did not pursue the idea.<ref name=\"Collier3\" /> At the time it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium&nbsp;\u2013 this was part of the [[germ theory of disease]].<ref name=\"Dimmock\">Dimmock p. 4</ref> In 1898, the Dutch microbiologist [[Martinus Beijerinck]] repeated the experiments and became convinced that the filtered solution contained a new form of infectious agent.<ref>Dimmock p.4\u20135</ref> He observed that the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing, but as his experiments did not show that it was made of particles, he called it a ''[[contagium vivum fluidum]]'' (soluble living germ) and re-introduced the word ''virus''.<ref name=\"Collier3\">Collier p. 3</ref> Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature, a theory later discredited by [[Wendell Stanley]], who proved they were particulate.<ref name=\"Collier3\" /> In the same year [[Friedrich Loeffler]] and Paul Frosch passed the first animal virus&nbsp;\u2013 agent of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] ([[aphthovirus]])&nbsp;\u2013 through a similar filter.<ref name=\"isbn0-12-375146-2\">{{vcite book |author=Fenner F. |editor=Mahy B.

He accurately diluted a suspension of these viruses and discovered that the highest dilutions (lowest virus concentrations), rather than killing all the bacteria, formed discrete areas of dead organisms. Counting these areas and multiplying by the dilution factor allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the original suspension.<ref>{{vcite journal|pmid = 17855060|author = D'Herelle F|title = On an invisible microbe antagonistic toward dysenteric bacilli: brief note by Mr. F.

The study of phages provided insights into the [[Gene expression#Regulation of gene expression|switching on and off of genes]], and a useful mechanism for introducing foreign genes into bacteria.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, viruses were defined in terms of their [[infectivity]], their ability to be filtered, and their requirement for living hosts. Viruses had been grown only in plants and animals. In 1906, [[Ross Granville Harrison]] invented a method for [[tissue culture|growing tissue]] in [[lymph]], and, in 1913, E. Steinhardt, C.

This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions: These can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material, in general, single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases, is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, the length of a helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus is an example of a helical virus.<ref>Collier p. 37</ref>\n\n; Icosahedral: Most animal viruses are icosahedral or near-spherical with chiral [[icosahedral symmetry]]. A regular [[icosahedron]] is the optimum way of forming a closed shell from identical sub-units. The minimum number of identical capsomeres required is twelve, each composed of five identical sub-units. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than twelve capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. Capsomeres at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called pentons. Capsomeres on the triangular faces are surrounded by six others and are called hexons.<ref>Collier pp. 40, 42</ref> Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved. The same protein may act as the subunit of both the pentamers and hexamers or they may be composed of different proteins.\n\n; Prolate: This is an icosahedron elongated along the fivefold axis and is a common arrangement of the heads of bacteriophages. This structure is composed of a cylinder with a cap at either end.<ref>{{vcite book |author=Casens, S|title=Desk Encyclopedia of General Virology|publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=2009 |pages=167\u2013174 |isbn=0-12-375146-2}}</ref>\n\n; Envelope{{anchor|Non-enveloped virus}}: Some species of virus envelop themselves in a modified form of one of the [[cell membranes]], either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as nuclear membrane or [[endoplasmic reticulum]], thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a [[viral envelope]]. This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host. The influenza virus and HIV use this strategy. Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the envelope for their infectivity.<ref>Collier pp. 42\u201343</ref>\n\n; Complex: These viruses possess a capsid that is neither purely helical nor purely icosahedral, and that may possess extra structures such as protein tails or a complex outer wall. Some bacteriophages, such as [[Enterobacteria phage T4]], have a complex structure consisting of an icosahedral head bound to a helical tail, which may have a [[hexagon]]al base plate with protruding protein tail fibres. This tail structure acts like a molecular syringe, attaching to the bacterial host and then injecting the viral genome into the cell.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Rossmann MG, Mesyanzhinov VV, Arisaka F, Leiman PG |title=The bacteriophage T4 DNA injection machine |journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=171\u201380 |year=2004 |pmid=15093831 |doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2004.02.001}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Poxviridae|poxviruses]] are large, complex viruses that have an unusual morphology.

The type of nucleic acid is irrelevant to the shape of the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented. For RNA viruses, each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together in one capsid. However, all segments are not required to be in the same virion for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by [[brome mosaic virus]] and several other plant viruses.<ref name=\"Collier3355\" />\n\nA viral genome, irrespective of nucleic acid type, is almost always either ''single-stranded'' or ''double-stranded''. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'', contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.<ref name=\"Collier9699\" />\n\nFor most viruses with RNA genomes and some with single-stranded DNA genomes, the single strands are said to be either [[positive-sense]] (called the ''plus-strand'') or [[negative-sense]] (called the ''minus-strand''), depending on if they are complementary to the viral [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately [[translation (genetics)|translated]] by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that the ''template strand'' for the viral mRNA is complementary to it (\u2212), and the ''coding strand'' is a copy of it (+).<ref name=\"Collier9699\" /> However, several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are [[ambisense]] in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate.

Instead, they use the machinery and metabolism of a host cell to produce multiple copies of themselves, and they ''assemble'' in the cell.\n{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=HepC replication.png|image2=Phage injecting its genome into bacteria.svg\n|width=250|caption1=A typical virus replication cycle|caption2=Some bacteriophages inject their [[genome]]s into bacterial cells (not to scale)}}\n\nThe life cycle of viruses differs greatly between species but there are six ''basic'' stages in the life cycle of viruses:<ref>Collier pp. 75\u201391</ref>\n\n'''''Attachment''''' is a specific binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host range of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human [[leucocytes]]. This is because its surface protein, [[gp120]], specifically interacts with the [[CD4]] molecule&nbsp;\u2013 a [[chemokine receptor]]&nbsp;\u2013 which is most commonly found on the surface of [[CD4+]] [[T-Cells]]. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that results in the [[Lipid bilayer fusion|fusion]] of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter.\n\n'''''[[Viral entry|Penetration]]''''' follows attachment: Virions enter the host cell through receptor-mediated [[endocytosis]] or [[Lipid bilayer fusion|membrane fusion]]. This is often called [[viral entry]]. The infection of plant and fungal cells is different from that of animal cells. Plants have a rigid cell wall made of [[cellulose]], and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall.<ref>Dimmock p. 70</ref> However, nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called [[plasmodesma]]ta.<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Boevink P, Oparka KJ|title=Virus-host interactions during movement processes|journal=Plant Physiol.|volume=138|issue=4|pages=1815\u201321|year=2005|pmid=16172094|pmc=1183373|doi=10.1104/pp.105.066761 }}</ref> Bacteria, like plants, have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell. However, given that bacterial cell walls are much less thick than plant cell walls due to their much smaller size, some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the cell wall, while the viral capsid remains outside.<ref>Dimmock p. 71</ref>\n\n'''''Uncoating''''' is a process in which the viral capsid is removed: This may be by degradation by viral enzymes or host enzymes or by simple dissociation; the end-result is the releasing of the viral genomic nucleic acid.\n\n'''''[[Viral replication|Replication]]''''' of viruses involves primarily multiplication of the genome. Replication involves synthesis of viral messenger RNA (mRNA) from \"early\" genes (with exceptions for positive sense RNA viruses), viral [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]], possible assembly of viral proteins, then viral genome replication mediated by early or regulatory protein expression. This may be followed, for complex viruses with larger genomes, by one or more further rounds of mRNA synthesis: \"late\" gene expression is, in general, of structural or virion proteins.\n\n'''''Assembly''''' \u2013 Following the structure-mediated self-''assembly'' of the virus particles, some modification of the proteins often occurs. In viruses such as HIV, this modification (sometimes called maturation) occurs ''after'' the virus has been released from the host cell.<ref name=\"pmid11451488\">{{vcite journal|author=Barman S, Ali A, Hui EK, Adhikary L, Nayak DP|title=Transport of viral proteins to the apical membranes and interaction of matrix protein with glycoproteins in the assembly of influenza viruses|journal=Virus Res.|volume=77|issue=1|pages=61\u20139|year=2001|pmid=11451488|doi=10.1016/S0168-1702(01)00266-0}}</ref>\n\n'''''Release''''' \u2013 Viruses can be ''[[viral shedding|released]]'' from the host cell by [[lysis]], a process that kills the cell by bursting its membrane and cell wall if present: This is a feature of many bacterial and some animal viruses. Some viruses undergo a [[lysogenic cycle]] where the viral genome is incorporated by [[genetic recombination]] into a specific place in the host's chromosome. The viral genome is then known as a \"[[provirus]]\" or, in the case of bacteriophages a \"[[prophage]]\".<ref>Shors pp. 60, 597</ref> Whenever the host divides, the viral genome is also replicated. The viral genome is mostly silent within the host. However, at some point, the provirus or prophage may give rise to active virus, which may lyse the host cells.<ref>Dimmock, Chapter 15, ''Mechanisms in virus latentcy'', pp.243\u2013259</ref> Enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV) typically are released from the host cell by [[viral shedding|budding]]. During this process the virus acquires its envelope, which is a modified piece of the host's plasma or other, internal membrane.<ref>Dimmock 185\u2013187</ref>\n\nThe genetic material within virus particles, and the method by which the material is replicated, varies considerably between different types of viruses.\n\n; [[DNA virus]]es : The genome replication of most DNA viruses takes place in the cell's [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell sometimes by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or&nbsp;\u2013 more usually&nbsp;\u2013 by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery. However, viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter the cell.<ref>Shors p. 54; Collier p. 78</ref>\n\n; [[RNA virus]]es: Replication usually takes place in the [[cytoplasm]]. RNA viruses can be placed into four different groups depending on their modes of replication. The [[Sense (molecular biology)|polarity]] (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own [[RNA replicase]] enzymes to create copies of their genomes.<ref>Collier p. 79</ref>\n\n; [[Reverse transcribing viruses]]: These have ssRNA (''[[Retroviridae]]'', ''[[Metaviridae]]'', ''[[Pseudoviridae]]'') or dsDNA (''[[Caulimoviridae]]'', and ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'') in their particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes (retroviruses), use a DNA intermediate to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes (pararetroviruses) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a [[reverse transcriptase]], or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, to carry out the nucleic acid conversion. [[Retrovirus]]es integrate the DNA produced by [[reverse transcription]] into the host genome as a provirus as a part of the replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus.<ref name=\"pmid16949329\">{{vcite journal |author=Staginnus C, Richert-P\u00f6ggeler KR |title=Endogenous pararetroviruses: two-faced travelers in the plant genome |journal=Trends in Plant Science |volume=11 |issue=10 |pages=485\u201391 |year=2006 |pmid=16949329 |doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2006.08.008}}</ref> They are susceptible to [[antiviral drug]]s that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. [[zidovudine]] and [[lamivudine]].

From the viewpoint of a materials scientist, viruses can be regarded as organic nanoparticles.\nTheir surface carries specific tools designed to cross the barriers of their host cells. The size and shape of viruses, and the number and nature of the functional groups on their surface, is precisely defined. As such, viruses are commonly used in materials science as scaffolds for covalently linked surface modifications. A particular quality of viruses is that they can be tailored by directed evolution. The powerful techniques developed by life sciences are becoming the basis of engineering approaches towards nanomaterials, opening a wide range of applications far beyond biology and medicine.<ref name=\"fischlechner\">{{vcite journal\n|title=Viruses as Building Blocks for Materials and Devices\n|doi=10.1002/anie.200603445\n|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition\n|volume=46\n|page=3184\n|year=2007\n|pmid=17348058\n|author=Fischlechner M, Donath E\n|issue=18\n|pages=3184\u201393}}</ref>\n\nBecause of their size, shape, and well-defined chemical structures, viruses have been used as templates for organising materials on the nanoscale.
