Just as a force is a push or a pull, a torque can be thought of as a twist to an object. Mathematically, torque is defined as the [[cross product]] of the vector by which the force's application point is offset relative to the fixed suspension point ([[Euclidean vector|distance vector]]) and the force vector, which tends to produce rotational motion.\n\nLoosely speaking, torque is a measure of the turning force on an object such as a bolt or a [[flywheel]]. For example, pushing or pulling the handle of a wrench connected to a nut or bolt produces a torque (turning force) that loosens or tightens the nut or bolt.\n\nThe symbol for torque is typically <math>\\tau</math>, the lowercase [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] ''[[tau]]''.

The definition of torque states that one or both of the [[angular velocity]] or the [[moment of inertia]] of an object are changing. ''Moment'' is the general term used for the tendency of one or more applied [[force]]s to rotate an object about an axis, but not necessarily to change the angular momentum of the object (the concept which is called ''torque'' in physics).<ref name=Kane>''Dynamics, Theory and Applications'' by T.R. Kane and D.A. Levinson, 1985, pp. 90\u201399: [http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/handle/1813/638 Free download]</ref> For example, a rotational force applied to a shaft causing acceleration, such as a drill bit accelerating from rest, results in a moment called a ''torque''. By contrast, a lateral force on a beam produces a moment (called a [[bending moment]]), but since the angular momentum of the beam is not changing, this bending moment is not called a ''torque''.  Similarly with any force couple on an object that has no change to its angular momentum, such moment is also not called a ''torque''.\n\nThis article follows the US physics terminology by calling all moments by the term ''torque'', whether or not they cause the angular momentum of an object to change.\n\n== History ==\nThe concept of torque, also called [[moment (physics)|moment]] or [[couple (mechanics)|couple]], originated with the studies of [[Archimedes]] on [[lever]]s. The term ''torque'' was apparently introduced into English scientific literature by [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]], the brother of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]], in 1884.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGVDAAAAIAAJ\n|page=civ\n|title=Collected Papers in Physics and Engineering\n|first1=James\n|last1=Thomson\n|first2=Joseph\n|last2=Larmor\n|publisher=University Press\n|date=1912}}, at [https://books.google.com/books Google books]</ref>\n\n==Definition and relation to angular momentum==\n[[File:Torque, position, and force.svg|thumb|right|A particle is located at position '''r''' relative to its axis of rotation.

A force of three [[newton (unit)|newtons]] applied two [[metre]]s from the fulcrum, for example, exerts the same torque as a force of one newton applied six metres from the fulcrum. The direction of the torque can be determined by using the [[right hand grip rule]]: if the fingers of the right hand are curled from the direction of the lever arm to the direction of the force, then the thumb points in the direction of the torque.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/tord.html|title=Right Hand Rule for Torque|accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref>\n\nMore generally, the torque on a particle (which has the position '''r''' in some reference frame) can be defined as the [[cross product]]:\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{F},</math>\nwhere '''r''' is the  particle's [[position vector]] relative to the fulcrum, and '''F''' is the force acting on the particle. The magnitude ''\u03c4'' of the torque is given by\n:<math>\\tau = rF\\sin\\theta,\\!</math>\nwhere ''r'' is the distance from the axis of rotation to the particle, ''F'' is the magnitude of the force applied, and ''\u03b8'' is the angle between the position and force vectors. Alternatively,\n:<math>\\tau = rF_{\\perp},</math>\nwhere ''F''<sub>\u22a5</sub> is the amount of force directed perpendicularly to the position of the particle. Any force directed parallel to the particle's position vector does not produce a torque.<ref name=\"halliday_184-85\">{{cite book|last1=Halliday|first1=David|last2=Resnick|first2=Robert|title=Fundamentals of Physics|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year=1970|pages=184\u201385}}</ref>\n\nIt follows from the properties of the cross product that the ''torque vector'' is perpendicular to both the ''position'' and ''force'' vectors. The ''torque vector'' points along the axis of the rotation that the ''force vector'' (starting from rest) would initiate. The resulting ''torque vector'' direction is determined by the right-hand rule.<ref name=\"halliday_184-85\" />\n\nThe unbalanced torque on a body along axis of rotation determines the rate of change of the body's [[angular momentum]],\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{L}}{\\mathrm{d}t}</math>\nwhere '''L''' is the angular momentum vector and ''t'' is time. If multiple torques are acting on the body, it is instead the net torque which determines the rate of change of the angular momentum:\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_1 + \\cdots + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_n = \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{net}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{L}}{\\mathrm{d}t}.</math>\n\nFor rotation about a fixed axis,\n:<math>\\mathbf{L} = I\\boldsymbol{\\omega},</math>\nwhere {{math|''I''}} is the [[moment of inertia]] and '''\u03c9''' is the [[angular velocity]]. It follows that\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{net}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{L}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}(I\\boldsymbol{\\omega})}{\\mathrm{d}t} = I\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = I\\boldsymbol{\\alpha},</math>\nwhere '''\u03b1''' is the [[angular acceleration]] of the body, measured in rad/s<sup>2</sup>. This equation has the limitation that the torque equation describes the instantaneous axis of rotation or center of mass for any type of motion \u2013 whether pure translation, pure rotation, or mixed motion. {{math|''I''}} = ''Moment of inertia'' about the point which the torque is written (either instantaneous axis of rotation or center of mass only). If body is in translatory equilibrium then the torque equation is the same about all points in the plane of motion.\n\nA torque is not necessarily limited to rotation around a fixed axis, however. It may change the magnitude and/or direction of the angular momentum vector, depending on the angle between the velocity vector and the non-radial component of the force vector, as viewed in the pivot's frame of reference. A net torque on a spinning body therefore may result in a [[precession]] without necessarily causing a change in spin rate.\n\n=== Proof of the equivalence of definitions ===\nThe definition of angular momentum for a single particle is:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\boldsymbol{p}</math>\n\nwhere \"\u00d7\" indicates the vector [[cross product]], '''p''' is the particle's [[linear momentum]], and '''r''' is the [[displacement vector]] from the origin (the origin is assumed to be a fixed location anywhere in space). The time-derivative of this is:\n\n:<math>\\frac{d\\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\frac{d\\boldsymbol{p}}{dt} + \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt} \\times \\boldsymbol{p}.</math>\n\nThis result can easily be proven by splitting the vectors into components and applying the [[product rule]]. Now using the definition of force <math>\\mathbf{F}=\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{p}}{dt}</math> (whether or not mass is constant) and the definition of velocity <math>\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt} = \\mathbf{v}</math>\n:<math>\\frac{d\\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{F} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\boldsymbol{p}. </math>\n\nThe cross product of momentum <math>\\boldsymbol{p}</math> with its associated velocity <math>\\mathbf{v}</math> is zero because velocity and momentum are parallel, so the second term vanishes.\n\nBy definition, torque '''\u03c4''' = '''r''' \u00d7 '''F'''. Therefore, torque on a particle is ''equal'' to the\n[[Derivative#Notation for differentiation|first derivative]] of its angular momentum with respect to time.\n\nIf multiple forces are applied, Newton's second law instead reads {{nowrap|'''F'''<sub>net</sub> {{=}} ''m'''a'''}}, and it follows that\n:<math>\\frac{d\\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{net}} =  \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{net}}.</math>\n\nThis is a general proof.\n\n== Units ==\nTorque has [[dimension (physics)|dimension]] force times [[distance]], symbolically {{dimanalysis|length=2|mass=1|time=\u22122}}. Official [[SI]] literature suggests using the unit ''[[newton metre]]'' (N\u22c5m) or the unit ''[[joule]] per [[radian]]''.<ref name=BIPM222>From the [http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/section2-2-2.html official SI website]: \"...For example, the quantity torque may be thought of as the cross product of force and distance, suggesting the unit newton metre, or it may be thought of as energy per angle, suggesting the unit joule per radian.\"</ref> The unit ''newton metre'' is properly denoted N\u22c5m or N&nbsp;m.<ref name=\"BIPM 5.1\">{{cite web|title=SI brochure Ed. 8, Section 5.1 | publisher = Bureau International des Poids et Mesures|year=2006|url=http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter5/5-1.html |accessdate = 2007-04-01}}</ref> This avoids ambiguity with mN, millinewtons.\n\nThe SI unit for [[energy]] or [[mechanical work|work]] is the [[joule]]. It is dimensionally equivalent to a force of one newton acting over a distance of one metre, but it is not used for torque. Energy and torque are entirely different concepts, so the practice of using different unit names (i.e., reserving newton metres for torque and using only [[joules]] for energy) helps avoid mistakes and misunderstandings.<ref name=BIPM222 /> The dimensional equivalence of these units, of course, is not simply a coincidence: a torque of 1&nbsp;N\u22c5m applied through a full revolution will require an [[energy]] of exactly 2\u03c0 joules. Mathematically,\n\n:<math>E= \\tau \\theta\\ </math>\n\nwhere ''E'' is the energy, ''\u03c4'' is magnitude of the torque, and ''\u03b8'' is the angle moved (in [[radian]]s). This equation motivates the alternate unit name ''joules per radian''.<ref name=BIPM222 />\n\nIn Imperial units, \"[[Pound-foot (torque)|pound-force-feet]]\" (lb\u22c5ft), \"foot-pounds-force\", \"inch-pounds-force\", \"ounce-force-[[inch]]es\" (oz\u22c5in) are used, and other non-SI units of torque includes \"metre-[[kilogram-force|kilograms-force]]\". For all these units, the word \"force\" is often left out.<ref>See, for example: {{cite web|title=CNC Cookbook: Dictionary: N-Code to PWM|url=http://www.cnccookbook.com/MTCNCDictNtoPWM.htm|accessdate=2008-12-17}}</ref> For example, abbreviating \"pound-force-foot\" to simply \"pound-foot\" (in this case, it would be implicit that the \"pound\" is [[pound-force]] and not [[pound-mass]]). This is an example of the confusion caused by the use of English units that may be avoided with SI units because of the careful distinction in SI between force (in newtons) and mass (in kilograms).\n\nTorque is sometimes listed with units that do not make dimensional sense, such as the gram-centimeter. In this case, \"gram\" should be understood as the force given by the weight of 1 gram at the surface of the earth, i.e., {{val|0.00980665|u=N}}. The surface of the earth is understood to have a standard acceleration of [[Gravity of Earth|gravity]] ({{val|9.80665|u=m/s<sup>2</sup>}}).\n\n== Special cases and other facts ==\n\n=== Moment arm formula ===\n[[File:moment arm.svg|thumb|right|Moment arm diagram]]\nA very useful special case, often given as the definition of torque in fields other than physics, is as follows:\n<!--:''\u03c4'' = moment arm \u00d7 force-->\n:<math>\\tau = (\\text{moment arm}) (\\text{force}).</math>\n\nThe construction of the \"moment arm\" is shown in the figure to the right, along with the vectors '''r''' and '''F''' mentioned above. The problem with this definition is that it does not give the direction of the torque but only the magnitude, and hence it is difficult to use in three-dimensional cases. If the force is perpendicular to the displacement vector '''r''', the moment arm will be equal to the distance to the centre, and torque will be a maximum for the given force. The equation for the magnitude of a torque, arising from a perpendicular force:\n\n<!--:''\u03c4'' = distance to centre \u00d7 Applied force-->\n:<math>\\tau = (\\text{distance to centre}) (\\text{force}).</math>\n\nFor example, if a person places a force of 10&nbsp;N at the terminal end of a wrench that is 0.5&nbsp;m long (or a force of 10&nbsp;N exactly 0.5&nbsp;m from the twist point of a wrench of any length), the torque will be 5&nbsp;N.m \u2013 assuming that the person moves the wrench by applying force in the plane of movement and perpendicular to the wrench.\n\n[[File:PrecessionOfATop.svg|thumb|right|The torque caused by the two opposing forces '''F'''<sub>g</sub> and \u2212'''F'''<sub>g</sub> causes a change in the angular momentum '''L''' in the direction of that torque. This causes the top to [[precess]].]]\n\n=== Static equilibrium ===\nFor an object to be in [[static equilibrium]], not only must the sum of the forces be zero, but also the sum of the torques (moments) about any point. For a two-dimensional situation with horizontal and vertical forces, the sum of the forces requirement is two equations: \u03a3''H'' = 0 and \u03a3''V'' = 0, and the torque a third equation: \u03a3''\u03c4'' = 0. That is, to solve [[statically determinate]] equilibrium problems in two-dimensions, three equations are used.\n\n=== Net force versus torque ===\nWhen the net force on the system is zero, the torque measured from any point in space is the same. For example, the torque on a current-carrying loop in a uniform magnetic field is the same regardless of your point of reference. If the net force <math>\\mathbf{F}</math> is not zero, and <math>\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_1</math> is the torque measured from <math>\\mathbf{r}_1</math>, then the torque measured from <math>\\mathbf{r}_2</math> is \u2026\n<math>\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_2 = \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_1 + (\\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2) \\times \\mathbf{F}</math>\n\n== Machine torque ==\n[[File:Torque Curve.svg|thumb|right|Torque curve of a motorcycle (\"BMW K 1200 R 2005\"). The horizontal axis is the speed (in [[rpm]]) that the [[crankshaft]] is turning, and the vertical axis is the torque (in [[Newton metre]]s) that the engine is capable of providing at that speed.]]\nTorque is part of the basic specification of an [[engine]]: the [[power (physics)|power]] output of an engine is expressed as its torque multiplied by its rotational speed of the axis. [[internal combustion|Internal-combustion]] engines produce useful torque only over a limited range of rotational speeds (typically from around 1,000\u20136,000 rpm for a small car). The varying torque output over that range can be  measured with a [[dynamometer]], and shown as a torque curve.\n\n[[Steam engine]]s and [[electric motor]]s tend to produce maximum torque close to zero rpm, with the torque diminishing as rotational speed rises (due to increasing friction and other constraints). Reciprocating steam engines can start heavy loads from zero RPM without a [[clutch]].\n\n== Relationship between torque, power, and energy ==\nIf a [[force]] is allowed to act through a distance, it is doing [[mechanical work]]. Similarly, if torque is allowed to act through a rotational distance, it is doing work. Mathematically, for rotation about a fixed axis through the [[center of mass]],\n:<math> W = \\int_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2} \\tau\\ \\mathrm{d}\\theta,</math>\nwhere ''W'' is work, ''\u03c4'' is torque, and ''\u03b8''<sub>1</sub> and ''\u03b8''<sub>2</sub> represent (respectively) the initial and final [[angular position]]s of the body.<ref name=\"kleppner_267-68\">{{cite book|last1=Kleppner|first1=Daniel|last2=Kolenkow|first2= Robert|title=An Introduction to Mechanics|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1973|pages=267\u201368}}</ref>\n\n===Proof===\nThe work done by a variable force acting over a finite linear displacement <math>s</math> is given by integrating the force with respect to an elemental linear displacement <math>\\mathrm{d}s</math>\n:<math>W = \\int_{s_1}^{s_2} \\vec{F}\\cdot\\vec{\\mathrm{d}s}</math>\n\nHowever, the infinitesimal linear displacement <math>\\vec{\\mathrm{d}s}</math> is related to a corresponding angular displacement <math>\\vec{\\mathrm{d}\\theta}</math> and the radius vector <math>\\vec{r}</math> as \n:<math>\\vec{\\mathrm{d}s} = \\vec{\\mathrm{d}\\theta}\\times\\vec{r}</math>\n\nSubstitution in the above expression for work gives\n:<math>W = \\int_{s_1}^{s_2} \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{\\mathrm{d}\\theta} \\times \\vec{r}</math>\n\nThe expression <math>\\vec{F}\\cdot\\vec{\\mathrm{d}\\theta}\\times\\vec{r}</math> is a [[scalar triple product]] given by <math>\\left[\\vec{F}\\,\\vec{\\mathrm{d}\\theta}\\,\\vec{r}\\right]</math>. An alternate expression for the same scalar triple product is\n:<math>\\left[\\vec{F}\\,\\vec{\\mathrm{d}\\theta}\\,\\vec{r}\\right] = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F} \\cdot\\vec{\\mathrm{d}\\theta}</math>\n\nBut as per the definition of torque,\n:<math>\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{r}\\times\\vec{F}</math>\n\nCorresponding substitution in the expression of work gives,\n:<math>W = \\int_{s_1}^{s_2} \\vec{\\tau}\\cdot\\vec{\\mathrm{d}\\theta}</math>\n\nSince the parameter of integration has been changed from linear displacement to angular displacement, the limits of the integration also change correspondingly, giving\n:<math>W = \\int_{\\theta _1}^{\\theta _2} \\vec{\\tau}\\cdot\\vec{\\mathrm{d}\\theta}</math>\n\nIf the torque and the angular displacement are in the same direction, then the scalar product reduces to a product of magnitudes; i.e., <math>\\vec{\\tau}\\cdot\\vec{\\mathrm{d}\\theta} = \\left|\\vec{\\tau}\\right|\\left| \\, \\vec{\\mathrm{d}\\theta}\\right|\\cos 0 = \\tau \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta</math> giving\n\n:<math>W = \\int_{\\theta _1}^{\\theta _2} \\tau \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta</math>\n\nIt follows from the [[work-energy theorem]] that ''W'' also represents the change in the [[Rotational energy|rotational kinetic energy]] ''E''<sub>r</sub> of the body, given by\n\n:<math>E_{\\mathrm{r}} = \\tfrac{1}{2}I\\omega^2,</math>\n\nwhere ''I'' is the [[moment of inertia]] of the body and ''\u03c9'' is its [[angular speed]].<ref name=\"kleppner_267-68\" />\n\n[[Power (physics)|Power]] is the work per unit [[time]], given by\n:<math>P = \\boldsymbol{\\tau} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\omega},</math>\nwhere ''P'' is power, '''\u03c4''' is torque, '''\u03c9''' is the [[angular velocity]], and \u22c5 represents the [[scalar product]].\n\nAlgebraically, the equation may be rearranged to compute torque for a given angular speed and power output. Note that the power injected by the torque depends only on the instantaneous angular speed \u2013 not on whether the angular speed increases, decreases, or remains constant while the torque is being applied (this is equivalent to the linear case where the power injected by a force depends only on the instantaneous speed \u2013 not on the resulting acceleration, if any).\n\nIn practice, this relationship can be observed in [[bicycle]]s: Bicycles are typically composed of two road wheels, front and rear gears (referred to as [[sprockets]]) meshing with a circular [[bicycle chain|chain]], and a [[derailleur gears|derailleur mechanism]] if the bicycle's transmission system allows multiple gear ratios to be used (i.e. [[Single-speed bicycle#Advantages and disadvantages versus multi-speed bicycles|multi-speed bicycle]]), all of which attached to the [[bicycle frame|frame]]. A [[cyclist]], the person who rides the bicycle, provides the input power by turning pedals, thereby [[Crank (mechanism)|cranking]] the front sprocket (commonly referred to as [[Crankset#Chainring|chainring]]). The input power provided by the cyclist is equal to the product of [[cadence (cycling)|cadence]] (i.e. the number of pedal revolutions per minute) and the torque on [[Axle|spindle]] of the bicycle's [[crankset]]. The bicycle's [[bicycle drivetrain systems|drivetrain]] transmits the input power to the road [[wheel]], which in turn conveys the received power to the road as the output power of the bicycle. Depending on the [[gear ratio]] of the bicycle, a (torque, rpm)<sub>input</sub> pair is converted to a (torque, rpm)<sub>output</sub> pair. By using a larger rear gear, or by switching to a lower gear in multi-speed bicycles, [[angular frequency|angular speed]] of the road wheels is decreased while the torque is increased, product of which (i.e. power) does not change.\n\nConsistent units must be used. For metric SI units, power is [[watt]]s, torque is [[newton metre]]s and angular speed is [[radian]]s per second (not rpm and not revolutions per second).\n\nAlso, the unit newton metre is [[dimensional analysis|dimensionally equivalent]] to the [[joule]], which is the unit of energy. However, in the case of torque, the unit is assigned to a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], whereas for [[energy]], it is assigned to a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]].\n\n=== Conversion to other units ===\nA conversion factor may be necessary when using different units of power or torque.  For example, if [[rotational speed]] (revolutions per time) is used in place of angular speed (radians per time), we multiply by a factor of 2{{pi}} radians per revolution. In the following formulas, ''P'' is power, ''\u03c4'' is torque, and ''\u03c9'' is rotational speed.\n:<math>P = \\tau \\times 2 \\pi \\times \\omega</math>\n\nShowing units:\n:<math> P ({\\rm W}) = \\tau {\\rm (N \\cdot m)} \\times 2 \\pi {\\rm (rad/rev)} \\times \\omega {\\rm (rev/sec)} </math>\n\nDividing by 60 seconds per minute gives us the following.\n:<math> P ({\\rm W}) = \\frac{ \\tau {\\rm (N \\cdot m)} \\times 2 \\pi {\\rm (rad/rev)} \\times \\omega {\\rm (rpm)} } {60} </math>\n\nwhere rotational speed is in revolutions per minute (rpm).\n\nSome people (e.g., American automotive engineers) use [[horsepower]] (imperial mechanical) for power, foot-pounds (lbf\u22c5ft) for torque and rpm for rotational speed. This results in the formula changing to:\n:<math> P ({\\rm hp}) = \\frac{ \\tau {\\rm (lbf \\cdot ft)} \\times 2 \\pi {\\rm (rad/rev)} \\times \\omega ({\\rm rpm})} {33,000}. </math>\n\nThe constant below (in foot pounds per minute) changes with the definition of the horsepower; for example, using metric horsepower, it becomes approximately 32,550.\n\nUse of other units (e.g., [[BTU]] per hour for power) would require a different custom conversion factor.\n\n=== Derivation ===\n\nFor a rotating object, the ''linear distance'' covered at the [[circumference]] of rotation is the product of the radius with the angle covered.  That is:  linear distance = radius \u00d7 angular distance.   And by definition, linear distance = linear speed \u00d7 time = radius \u00d7 angular speed \u00d7 time.\n\nBy the definition of torque: torque = radius \u00d7 force. We can rearrange this to determine force = torque \u00f7 radius. These two values can be substituted into the definition of [[Power (physics)|power]]:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{power} & = \\frac{\\text{force} \\times \\text{linear distance}}{\\text{time}} \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\frac{\\left(\\dfrac{\\text{torque}} r \\right) \\times (r \\times \\text{angular speed} \\times t)} t \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\text{torque} \\times \\text{angular speed}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe radius ''r'' and time ''t'' have dropped out of the equation.  However, angular speed must be in radians, by the assumed direct relationship between linear speed and angular speed at the beginning of the derivation.  If the rotational speed is measured in revolutions per unit of time, the linear speed and distance are increased proportionately by 2{{pi}} in the above derivation to give:\n\n: <math>\\text{power} = \\text{torque} \\times 2 \\pi \\times \\text{rotational speed}. \\,</math>\n\nIf torque is in newton metres and rotational speed in revolutions per second, the above equation gives power in newton metres per second or watts.  If Imperial units are used, and if torque is in pounds-force feet and rotational speed in revolutions per minute, the above equation gives power in foot pounds-force per minute.  The horsepower form of the equation is then derived by applying the conversion factor 33,000&nbsp;ft\u22c5lbf/min per horsepower:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{power} & = \\text{torque} \\times 2 \\pi \\times \\text{rotational speed} \\cdot \\frac{\\text{ft}\\cdot\\text{lbf}}{\\text{min}} \\times \\frac{\\text{horsepower}}{33,000 \\cdot \\frac{\\text{ft}\\cdot\\text{lbf}}{\\text{min}}} \\\\[6pt]\n& \\approx \\frac {\\text{torque} \\times \\text{RPM}}{5,252}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nbecause <math>5252.113122 \\approx \\frac {33,000} {2 \\pi}. \\,</math>\n\n== Principle of moments ==\nThe Principle of Moments, also known as Varignon's theorem (not to be confused with the [[Varignon's theorem|geometrical theorem]] of the same name) states that the sum of torques due to several forces applied to ''a single'' point is equal to the torque due to the sum (resultant) of the forces. Mathematically, this follows from:\n:<math>(\\mathbf{r}\\times\\mathbf{F}_1) + (\\mathbf{r}\\times\\mathbf{F}_2) + \\cdots = \\mathbf{r}\\times(\\mathbf{F}_1+\\mathbf{F}_2 + \\cdots). </math>\n\n== Torque multiplier ==\n{{Main|Torque multiplier}}\nA torque multiplier is a [[gear box]] with reduction ratios greater than 1.  The given torque at the input gets multiplied as per the reduction ratio and transmitted to the output, thereby achieving greater torque, but with reduced rotational speed.\n\n== See also ==\n{{cmn|2|\n* [[Conversion of units#Torque or moment of force|Conversion of units]]\n* [[Friction torque]]\n* [[Mechanical equilibrium]]\n* [[Rigid body dynamics]]\n* [[Statics]]\n* [[Torque converter]]\n* [[Torque limiter]]\n* [[Torque screwdriver]]\n* [[Torque tester]]\n* [[Torque wrench]]\n* [[Torsion (mechanics)]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{commons category|Torque}}\n* [http://craig.backfire.ca/pages/autos/horsepower \"Horsepower and Torque\"] An article showing how power, torque, and gearing affect a vehicle's performance.\n* [http://kevinthenerd.googlepages.com/torque_vs_hp.html \"Torque vs. Horsepower: Yet Another Argument\"] An automotive perspective\n* [http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/2cl/ch05/ch05.html a discussion of torque and angular momentum in an online textbook]\n* [http://www.physnet.org/modules/pdf_modules/m34.pdf ''Torque and Angular Momentum in Circular Motion ''] on [http://www.physnet.org/ Project PHYSNET].\n* [http://www.phy.hk/wiki/englishhtm/Torque.htm An interactive simulation of torque]\n* [http://www.lorenz-messtechnik.de/english/company/torque_unit_calculation.php Torque Unit Converter]\n* [http://www.clarifyscience.info/part/ZoomB?v=A&p=CK6Ji&m=torque A feel for torque] An order-of-magnitude interactive.\n\n{{Classical mechanics derived SI units}}\n\n[[Category:Physical quantities]]\n[[Category:Rotation]]\n[[Category:Force]]\n[[Category:Torque|*]]"}]}}}}
