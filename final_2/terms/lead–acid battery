Despite having a very low energy-to-weight ratio and a low energy-to-volume ratio, its ability to supply high [[surge current]]s means that the cells have a relatively large [[power-to-weight ratio]]. These features, along with their low cost, makes it attractive for use in motor vehicles to provide the high current required by [[Automobile self starter|automobile starter motors]].\n\nAs they are inexpensive compared to newer technologies, lead-acid batteries are widely used even when surge current is not important and other designs could provide higher [[energy density|energy densities]]. Large-format lead-acid designs are widely used for storage in backup power supplies in [[cell phone]] towers, high-availability settings like hospitals, and [[stand-alone power system]]s. For these roles, modified versions of the standard cell may be used to improve storage times and reduce maintenance requirements. '''Gel-cells''' and '''absorbed glass-mat''' batteries are common in these roles, collectively known as [[VRLA battery|VRLA (valve-regulated lead-acid) batteries]].\n\nLead\u2013acid battery sales account for 40\u201345% of the value from batteries sold worldwide (1999, not including China and Russia), a manufacturing market value of about $15 billion.<ref name=Linden2002>\n{{cite book |editor1=Linden, David |editor2=Reddy, Thomas B. |title=Handbook Of Batteries |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2002 |isbn=0-07-135978-8 |page=23.5 |edition=3rd }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of the battery}}\n\nThe French scientist Gautherot observed in 1801 that wires that had been used for electrolysis experiments would themselves provide a small amount of \"secondary\" current after the main battery had been disconnected.<ref>http://lead-acid.com/lead-acid-battery-history.shtml \"The History of the Lead Acid Battery\" retrieved 2014 Feb 22</ref>   In 1859, [[Gaston Plant\u00e9]]'s lead\u2013acid battery was the first battery that could be recharged by passing a reverse current through it. Plant\u00e9's first model consisted of two lead sheets separated by rubber strips and rolled into a spiral.<ref>[http://www.corrosion-doctors.org/Biographies/PlantelBio.htm \"Gaston Plant\u00e9 (1834-1889)\"], Corrosion-doctors.org; Last accessed on Jan 3, 2007</ref> His batteries were first used to power the lights in train carriages while stopped at a station. In 1881, [[Camille Alphonse Faure]] invented an improved version that consisted of a lead grid lattice, into which a lead oxide paste was pressed, forming a plate. This design was easier to mass-produce. An early manufacturer (from 1886) of lead\u2013acid batteries was [[Henri Tudor]].\n\nUsing a gel electrolyte instead of a liquid allows the battery to be used in different positions without leakage. Gel electrolyte batteries for any position date from 1930s, and even in the late 1920s portable suitcase radio sets allowed the cell vertical or horizontal (but not inverted) due to valve design (see third Edition of ''Wireless Constructor's Encyclopaedia'' by [[Frederick James Camm]]).  In the 1970s, the [[VRLA battery|valve-regulated]] lead acid battery (often called \"sealed\") was developed, including modern absorbed glass mat types, allowing operation in any position.\n\n==Electrochemistry==\n\n=== Discharge ===\n[[Image:Discharged.gif|thumb|alt=A lead\u2013acid cell with two lead sulfate plates.|Fully discharged: two identical lead sulfate plates]]\nIn the discharged state both the positive and negative plates become [[lead(II) sulfate]] ({{chem|PbSO|4}}), and the [[electrolyte]] loses much of its dissolved [[sulfuric acid]] and becomes primarily water.\nThe discharge process is driven by the conduction of electrons from the negative plate back into the cell at the positive plate in the external circuit.\n\n;Negative plate reaction:{{chem|Pb}}(s) + {{chem|HSO|4|-}}(aq) \u2192 {{chem|PbSO|4}}(s) + {{chem|H|+}}(aq) + 2e<sup>\u2212</sup>                                    Release of two conducting electrons gives lead electrode a net negative charge\n\u2022 As electrons accumulate they create an electric field which attracts hydrogen ions\nand repels sulfate ions, leading to a double-layer near the surface. The hydrogen\nions screen the charged electrode from the solution which limits further reactions\nunless charge is allowed to flow out of electrode.\n;Positive plate reaction:{{chem|PbO|2}}(s) + {{chem|HSO|4|-}}(aq) + 3{{chem|H|+}}(aq) + 2e<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 {{chem|PbSO|4}}(s) + 2{{chem|H|2|O}}(l)\n\nThe total reaction can be written as\n:{{chem|Pb}}(s) + {{chem|PbO|2}}(s) + 2{{chem|H|2|SO|4}}(aq) \u2192 2{{chem|PbSO|4}}(s) + 2{{chem|H|2|O}}(l)\n\nThe sum of the molecular masses of the reactants is 642.6 g/mol, so theoretically a cell can produce two [[Faraday (unit)|faradays]] of charge (192,971 [[coulomb]]s) from 642.6 g of reactants, or 83.4 [[ampere-hour]]s per kilogram (or 13.9 ampere-hours per kilogram for a 12-volt battery).{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} For a 2 volts cell, this comes to 167 [[watt-hour]]s per kilogram of reactants, but a lead\u2013acid cell in practice gives only 30\u201340 watt-hours per kilogram of battery, due to the mass of the water and other constituent parts.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n=== Charging ===\n[[File: Recharged.gif|thumb|Fully recharged: Lead [[anode]], Lead oxide [[cathode]] and sulfuric acid electrolyte]]\nIn the fully charged state, the negative plate consists of lead, and the positive plate [[lead dioxide]], with the electrolyte of concentrated sulfuric acid.\n\nOvercharging with high charging [[voltage]]s generates [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]] gas by [[electrolysis of water]], which is lost to the cell. The design of some types of lead-acid battery allow the electrolyte level to be inspected and topped up with any water that has been lost.\n\nDue to the [[freezing-point depression]] of the electrolyte, as the battery discharges and the concentration of sulfuric acid decreases, the electrolyte is more likely to freeze during winter weather when discharged.\n\n=== Ion motion ===\nDuring discharge, {{chem|H|+}} produced at the negative plates moves into the electrolyte solution and then is consumed into the positive plates, while {{chem|HSO|4|-}} is consumed at both plates. The reverse occurs during charge.  This motion can be by electrically driven proton flow or [[Grotthuss mechanism]], or by [[diffusion]] through the medium, or by flow of a liquid electrolyte medium.  Since the density is greater when the sulfuric acid concentration is higher, the liquid will tend to circulate by [[convection]].  Therefore, a liquid-medium cell tends to rapidly discharge and rapidly charge more efficiently than an otherwise similar gel cell.\n\n== Measuring the charge level ==\n[[File:Hydrometer (PSF).png|thumb|right| A [[hydrometer]] can be used to test the specific gravity of each cell as a measure of its state of charge.]]\nBecause the electrolyte takes part in the charge-discharge reaction, this battery has one major advantage over other chemistries. It is relatively simple to determine the state of charge by merely measuring the [[Relative density|specific gravity]] of the electrolyte; the specific gravity falls as the battery discharges. Some battery designs include a simple [[hydrometer]] using colored floating balls of differing [[density]]. When used in diesel-electric [[submarine]]s, the specific gravity was regularly measured and written on a blackboard in the control room to indicate how much longer the boat could remain submerged.<ref>For one example account of the importance of battery SG to submariners, see {{cite book |author=Ruhe, William J. |title=War in the Boats: My World War II Submarine Battles |publisher=Brassey's |year=1996 |isbn=1-57488-028-4 |page=112 }}</ref>\n\nThe battery's open-circuit voltage can also be used to gauge the state of charge.<ref>http://www.windsun.com/Batteries/Battery_FAQ.htm#Battery%20Voltages Battery voltages</ref> If the connections to the individual cells are accessible, then the state of charge of each cell can be determined which can provide a guide as to the state of health of the battery as a whole, otherwise the overall battery voltage may be assessed.\n\nNote that neither technique gives any indication of charge capacity, only charge level. Charge capacity of any rechargeable battery will decline with age and usage, meaning that it may no longer be fit for purpose even when nominally fully charged. Other tests, usually involving current drain, are used to determine the residual charge capacity of a battery.\n\n== Voltages for common usages ==\n\nFor the three-stage charging procedure of lead acid batteries, see [[IUoU battery charging]]. The theoretical voltage of a lead acid battery is 12&nbsp;V for 6 cages and 2&nbsp;V for one cage. These are general voltage ranges per cell:\n* Open-circuit (quiescent) at ''full charge'': 2.10&nbsp;V\n* Open-circuit at ''full discharge'': 1.95&nbsp;V\n* Loaded at full discharge: 1.8&nbsp;V \n* Continuous-preservation (float) charging: 2.23&nbsp;V for gelled electrolyte; 2.25&nbsp;V for absorbed glass mat (AGM) and 2.32&nbsp;V for flooded cells. [[Float voltage]] recommendations vary among manufacturers due to different lead acid concentration and positive plate grid alloy. Precise float voltage (\u00b10.05&nbsp;V) is critical to longevity; insufficient voltage (causes [[#Sulfation and desulfation|sulfation]]) is almost as detrimental as excessive voltage (causes positive plate [[corrosion]], expansion and [[electrolyte]] loss.)\n* Typical (daily) charging: 2.28\u20132.4&nbsp;V (depending on temperature and manufacturer's recommendation)\n* Equalization charging (for flooded lead acids): 2.5\u20132.67&nbsp;V<ref>[http://support.rollsbattery.com/support/solutions/articles/428-state-of-charge-charging-flooded-lead-acid-batteries#article-body \"Recommended voltage settings for 3 phase charging of flooded lead acid batteries.\"], Rolls Battery, Retrieved on 17 April 2015.</ref> <small>(5&nbsp;A per 100&nbsp;Ah,<ref>[http://www.rolls-battery.com/content/technical-downloads?q=node/47&phpMyAdmin=2eda4dec0bd69647b9e3cf0f71e01d23&phpMyAdmin=9dec4a269d70t7a63be7c#content \"Preventive Maintenance, Charging and Equalization\"], Rolls Battery, Retrieved on 17 April 2015.</ref> Battery temperature must be absolutely monitored very closely, check manufacturers recommendation)</small>\n* Charging in sulfated state <small>(stored discharged for days or weeks)</small> not accepting small charge current: > 3&nbsp;V<ref>[http://www.exide.com/Media/files/Downloads/IndustEuro/Operating%20Instructions/Handbook,%20part%201,%20edition%206,%20Feb_%202012.pdf \"Handbook for stationary lead-acid batteries (part 1: basics, design, operation modes and applications), page 65\"], GNB Industrial Power, a division of Exide Technologies, Edition 6, February 2012</ref> (only until a charge current is flowing)\n* Charging in sulfated state: up to 2.6\u20132.66&nbsp;V<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Moderne Akkumulatoren, Page 55, ISBN 3-939359-11-4</ref>\n* Discharging in sulfated state: 1.6&nbsp;V <small>(when charging at low rates doesn't improve, discharge rate approximately 5&nbsp;A per 10&nbsp;Ah)</small><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* Gassing threshold: 2.415&nbsp;V<ref>[http://www.powerstream.com/SLA.htm#Basics \"Sealed lead acid battery charging basic\"], Powerstream, Retrieved on 17 April 2015.</ref>\u20132.48<ref>[http://www.dynamis-batterien.de/pdfs/DYNAMIS-Handling-Lead-Batteries.pdf \"Sealed lead acid batteries technical manual\"], Dynamis Batterien, Page 9, Version 04.12.2006 retrieved on 17 April 2015.</ref> for sealed, 2.41&nbsp;V for PzS, 2.36\u20132.41&nbsp;V for GiS, PzV, GiV<ref name=\"zvei.org\">[http://www.zvei.org/Verband/Fachverbaende/Batterien/Documents/Merkblaetter/10%20e%20OpportunityCharging%20TractionBatteries%202011-12.pdf \"Opportunity charging traction batteries - Information leaflet 10e, December 2011\"], ZVEI, Page 2, Retrieved on 17 April 2015.</ref> <small>(the value is manufacturer specific, gas is always produced even in storage,<ref>[http://www.battcon.com/papersfinal2008/odonnellpaper2008proof_6.pdf \"Hydrogen gas management for flooded lead acid batteries\"], Mesa Technical Associates Inc. and Hoppecke Batterien GmbH & Co KG, Page 1, Retrieved on 17 April 2015.</ref> 99% of the gas production recombines under normal charging conditions, the higher the voltage exponentially more gas is produced: from 2.3 to 2.5 is factor 1 to > 20,<ref>[https://www.cdtechno.com/pdf/ref/41_6739_0112.pdf \"Gassing and ventilation\"], cdtechno.com, Page 2, Retrieved on 17 April 2015.{{Dead link |date=September 2016}}</ref> charging above the gassing voltage with high charging current the side reaction will occur enhanced<ref name=\"zvei.org\"/>)</small>\n\nAll voltages are at {{convert|20|C|F}}, and must be adjusted for temperature changes.

See [[Automotive battery#Terminal voltage|voltage vs. temperature table]].\n\n==Construction==\n\n===Plates===\n[[File:Open Lead acid battery.jpg|thumb|An opened two-wheeler self-starter battery]]\nThe lead\u2013acid cell can be demonstrated using sheet lead plates for the two electrodes.  However, such a construction produces only around one ampere for roughly postcard-sized plates, and for only a few minutes.\n\n[[Gaston Plant\u00e9]] found a way to provide a much larger effective surface area. In Plant\u00e9's design, the positive and negative plates were formed of two spirals of lead foil, separated with a sheet of cloth and coiled up. The cells initially had low capacity, so a slow process of \"forming\" was required to corrode the lead foils, creating  lead dioxide on the plates and roughening them to increase surface area. Initially this process used electricity from primary batteries; when generators became available after 1870, the cost of production of batteries greatly declined.<ref name=\"Linden2002\"/>   Plant\u00e9 plates are still used in some stationary applications, where the plates are mechanically grooved to increase their surface area.\n\nIn 1880, [[Camille Alphonse Faure]] patented a method of coating a lead grid (which serves as the current conductor) with a paste of lead oxides, sulfuric acid and water, followed by curing phase in which the plates were exposed to gentle heat in a high humidity environment. The curing process caused the paste to change to a mixture of lead sulfates which adhered to the lead plate. Then, during the battery's initial charge (called \"formation\") the cured paste on the plates was converted into electrochemically active material (the \"active mass\"). Faure's process significantly reduced the time and cost to manufacture lead\u2013acid batteries, and gave a substantial increase in capacity compared with Plant\u00e9's battery.<ref>{{cite book | last = Dell | first = Ronald | authorlink = |author2=David Anthony |author3=James Rand  | title = Understanding Batteries | publisher = [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] | year = 2001 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-85404-605-4}}</ref> Faure's method is still in use today, with only incremental improvements to paste composition, curing (which is still done with steam, but is now a very tightly controlled process), and structure and composition of the grid to which the paste is applied.\n\nThe grid developed by Faure was of pure lead with connecting rods of lead at right angles. In contrast, present-day grids are structured for improved mechanical strength and improved current flow. In addition to different grid patterns (ideally, all points on the plate are equidistant from the power conductor), modern-day processes also apply one or two thin fibre-glass mats over the grid to distribute the weight more evenly. And while Faure had used pure lead for his grids, within a year (1881) these had been superseded by lead-[[antimony]] (8\u201312%) alloys to give the structures additional rigidity. However, high-antimony grids have higher hydrogen evolution (which also accelerates as the battery ages), and thus greater outgassing and higher maintenance costs. These issues were identified by U. B. Thomas and W. E. Haring at Bell Labs in the 1930s and eventually led to the development of lead-[[calcium]] grid alloys in 1935 for standby power batteries on the U.S. telephone network. Related research led to the development of lead-[[selenium]] grid alloys in Europe a few years later. Both lead-calcium and lead-selenium grid alloys still add antimony, albeit in much smaller quantities than the older high-antimony grids: lead-calcium grids have 4\u20136% antimony while lead-selenium grids have 1\u20132%. These metallurgical improvements give the grid more strength, which allows it carry more weight, i.e. more active material, and so the plates can be thicker, which in turn contributes to battery lifespan since there is more material available to shed before the battery becomes unusable. High-antimony alloy grids are still used in batteries intended for frequent cycling, e.g. in motor-starting applications where frequent expansion/contraction of the plates needs to be compensated for, but where outgassing is not significant since charge currents remain low. Since the 1950s, batteries designed for infrequent cycling applications (e.g., standby power batteries) increasingly have lead-calcium or lead-selenium alloy grids since these have less hydrogen evolution and thus lower maintenance overhead. Lead-calcium alloy grids are cheaper to manufacture (the cells thus have lower up-front costs), and have a lower self-discharge rate, and lower watering requirements, but have slightly poorer conductivity, are mechanically weaker (and thus require more antimony to compensate), and are strongly subject to corrosion (and thus a shorter lifespan) than cells with lead-selenium alloy grids.\n\nAllegedly the US Navy submarines have switched from trickle charging AGM (lead calcium plate technology) to cycling the battery between trickle discharging, and trickle charging their batteries to prevent the open circuit effect caused by the calcium in the lead grids. This open circuit effect is caused by the calcium oxidizing.\n\nThe open circuit effect is also known as the antimony free effect.<ref>http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs-wm/9712.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.labatscience.com/2_1_4_8.html</ref>\n\nModern-day paste contains [[carbon black]], ''blanc fixe''  ([[barium sulfate]]) and [[lignosulfonate]]. The blanc fixe acts as a seed crystal for the lead\u2013to\u2013[[lead sulfate]] reaction. The blanc fixe must be fully dispersed in the paste in order for it to be effective. The lignosulfonate prevents the negative plate from forming a solid mass during the discharge cycle, instead enabling the formation of long needle\u2013like [[dendrite]]s. The long crystals have more surface area and are easily converted back to the original state on charging. Carbon black counteracts the effect of inhibiting formation caused by the lignosulfonates. Sulfonated [[naphthalene]] condensate dispersant is a more effective expander than lignosulfonate and speeds up formation. This dispersant improves dispersion of [[barium sulfate]] in the paste, reduces hydroset time, produces a more breakage-resistant plate, reduces fine lead particles and thereby improves handling and  pasting characteristics. It extends battery life by increasing end-of-charge voltage. Sulfonated naphthalene requires about one-third to one-half the amount of lignosulfonate and is stable to higher temperatures.<ref>United States Patent 5,948,567</ref>\n\nOnce dry, the plates are stacked with suitable separators and inserted in a cell container. The alternate plates then constitute alternating positive and negative electrodes, and within the cell are later connected to one another (negative to negative, positive to positive) in parallel. The separators inhibit the plates from touching each other, which would otherwise constitute a short circuit. In flooded and gel cells, the separators are insulating rails or studs, formerly of glass or ceramic, and now of plastic. In AGM cells, the separator is the glass mat itself, and the rack of plates with separators are squeezed together before insertion into the cell; once in the cell, the glass mats expand slightly, effectively locking the plates in place. In multi-cell batteries, the cells are then connected to one another in series, either through connector through the cell walls, or by a bridge over the cell walls. All intra-cell and inter-cell connections are of the same lead alloy as that used in the grids. This is necessary to prevent [[galvanic corrosion]].\n\nSo-called \"deep cycle\" batteries employ a different geometry for their positive electrodes. In this geometry, the positive electrode is not a flat plate but a row of lead-oxide cylinders or tubes strung side by side (hence the term \"tubular\" or \"cylindrical\" batteries for this geometry). The advantage of this geometry is an increased surface area in contact with the electrolyte, which in turn allows higher discharge/charge currents than a flat-plate cell of the same volume and depth-of-charge. Tubular-electrode cells thus exhibit a higher [[power density]] than flat-plate cells. This makes tubular/cylindrical geometry plates especially suitable for high-current applications with storage weight/space limitations, such as for forklifts or for starting marine diesel engines.  However, because tubes/cylinders have less active material in the same volume, they also have a lower [[energy density]] than flat-plate cells. And, less active material at the electrode also means they have less material available to shed before the cell becomes unusable. Tubular/cylindrical electrodes are also more complicated to manufacture uniformly,<!-- because uniform density of active material is difficult to control in a tubular geometry --> which tends to make them more expensive than flat-plate cells. These trade-offs limit the range of applications in which tubular/cylindrical batteries are meaningful to situations where there is insufficient space to install higher capacity (and thus larger) flat-plate units.\n\nAbout 60% of the weight of an automotive-type lead\u2013acid battery rated around 60 A\u00b7h (8.7&nbsp;kg of a 14.5&nbsp;kg battery) is lead or internal parts made of lead; the balance is electrolyte, separators, and the case.<ref name=\"Linden2002\"/>\n\n===Separators===\nSeparators between the positive and negative plates prevent short-circuit through  physical contact, mostly through [[dendrite (crystal)|dendrite]]s (\"treeing\"), but also through shedding of the active material. Separators obstruct the flow of ions between the plates and increase the internal resistance of the cell. Wood, rubber, glass fiber mat, [[cellulose]], and [[PVC]] or [[polyethylene]] plastic have been used to make separators. Wood was the original choice, but deteriorated in the acid electrolyte. Rubber separators are stable in battery acid and provide valuable electrochemical advantages that other materials cannot.\n\nAn effective separator must possess a number of mechanical properties; such as [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]], porosity, pore size distribution, [[specific surface area]], mechanical design and strength, [[electrical resistance]], [[ionic conductivity]], and chemical compatibility with the electrolyte. In service, the separator must have good resistance to acid and [[oxidation]]. The area of the separator must be a little larger than the area of the plates to prevent material shorting between the plates. The separators must remain stable over the battery's [[operating temperature]] range.\n\n===Absorbed glass mat (AGM)===\n\nIn the absorbed glass mat design, or AGM for short, the spaces between the cells is replaced by a [[glass fibre]] mat soaked in electrolyte. There is only enough electrolyte in the mat to keep it wet, and if the battery is punctured the electrolyte will not flow out of the mats. Likewise, the mat greatly reduces evaporation, to the point that the batteries do not require periodic refilling of the water. This combination of features allows the battery to be completely sealed, which makes them useful in portable devices and similar roles.\n\nTo reduce the water loss rate calcium is alloyed with the plates, however gas build-up remains a problem when the battery is deeply or rapidly charged or discharged. to prevent over-pressurization of the battery casing, AGM batteries include a one-way blow-off valve, and are often known as \"valve regulated lead\u2013acid\", or VRLA, designs.\n\nAnother advantage to the AGM design is that the electrolyte becomes the separator material, and mechanically strong. This allows the plate stack to be compressed together in the battery shell, slightly increasing energy density compared to liquid or gel versions. AGM batteries often show a characteristic \"bulging\" in their shells when built in common rectangular shapes.\n\nThe mat also prevents the vertical motion of the electrolyte within the battery. When a normal wet cell is stored in a discharged state, the heavier acid molecules tend to settle to the bottom of the battery, causing the electrolyte to stratify. When the battery is then used, the majority of the current flows only in this area, and the bottom of the plates tend to wear out rapidly. This is one of the reasons a conventional car battery can be ruined by leaving it stored for a long period and then used and recharged. The mat significantly prevents this stratification, eliminating the need to periodically shake the batteries, boil them, or run an \"equalization charge\" through them to mix the electrolyte. Stratification also causes the upper layers of the battery to become almost completely water, which can freeze in cold weather, AGMs are significantly less susceptible to damage due to low-temperature use.\n\nWhile AGM cells do not permit watering (typically it is impossible to add water without drilling a hole in the battery), their recombination process is fundamentally limited by the usual chemical processes. Hydrogen gas will even diffuse right through the plastic case itself. Some have found that it is profitable to add water to an AGM battery, but this must be done slowly to allow for the water to mix via diffusion throughout the battery. When a lead-acid battery loses water, its acid concentration increases, increasing the corrosion rate of the plates significantly. AGM cells already have a high acid content in an attempt to lower the water loss rate and increase standby voltage, and this brings about short life. If the open circuit voltage of AGM cells is significantly higher than 2.093 volts, or 12.56&nbsp;V for a 12&nbsp;V battery, then they have a higher acid content than a flooded cell; while this is normal for an AGM battery, it is not desirable for long life.\n\nAGM cells intentionally or accidentally overcharged will show a higher open circuit voltage according to the water lost (and acid concentration increased). One amp-hour of overcharge will liberate 0.335 grams of water; some of this liberated hydrogen and oxygen will recombine, but not all of it.\n\n===Gelled electrolytes===\n{{main|VRLA battery#Gel_battery}}\nDuring the 1970s, researchers developed the sealed version or \"gel battery\", which mixes a silica gelling agent into the electrolyte (silica-gel based lead-acid batteries used in portable radios from early 1930s were not fully sealed). This converts the formerly liquid interior of the cells into a semi-stiff paste, providing many of the same advantages of the AGM. Such designs are even less susceptible to evaporation and are often used in situations where little or no periodic maintenance is possible. Gel cells also have lower freezing and higher boiling points than the liquid electrolytes used in conventional wet cells and AGMs, which makes them suitable for use in extreme conditions.\n\nThe only downside to the gel design is that the gel prevents rapid motion of the ions in the electrolyte, which reduces carrier mobility and thus surge current capability. For this reason, gel cells are most commonly found in energy storage applications like off-grid systems.\n\n===\"Maintenance free\", \"sealed\" and \"VRLA\"===\nBoth gel and AGM designs are sealed, do not require watering, can be used in any orientation, and use a valve for gas blowoff. For this reason, both designs can be called maintenance free, sealed and VRLA. However, it is quite common to find resources stating that these terms refer to one or another of these designs, specifically.\n\n==Applications==\nMost of the world's lead-acid batteries are [[car battery|automobile starting, lighting and ignition]] (SLI) batteries, with an estimated 320 million units shipped in 1999.<ref name=Linden2002/> In 1992 <!--and I wish I had 20 year newer statistics --> about 3 million tons of lead were used in the manufacture of batteries.\n\nWet cell stand-by (stationary) batteries designed for deep discharge are commonly used  in large backup power supplies for telephone and computer centres, [[grid energy storage]], and off-grid household electric power systems.<ref>[http://www.altestore.com/howto/Solar-Power-Residential-Mobile-PV/Solar-Components/Solar-Batteries-Deep-Cycle-Batteries/Deep-Cycle-Batteries-Introduction/a85/ Introduction to Deep Cycle Batteries in RE Systems]</ref>  Lead\u2013acid batteries are used in emergency lighting and to power sump pumps in case of [[power failure]].\n\n[[Traction battery|Traction (propulsion) batteries]] are used in [[golf cart]]s and other [[battery electric vehicle]]s. Large lead-acid batteries are also used to power the [[electric motor]]s in [[diesel-electric]] (conventional) [[submarines]] when submerged, and are used as emergency power on [[nuclear submarine]]s as well. [[VRLA|Valve-regulated lead acid batteries]] cannot spill their electrolyte. They are used in [[back-up power]] supplies for alarm and smaller computer systems (particularly in uninterruptible power supplies; UPS) and for [[electric scooter]]s, electric [[wheelchair]]s, [[electrified bicycle]]s, marine applications, battery electric vehicles or micro [[hybrid vehicle]]s, and  motorcycles.\n\nLead-acid batteries were used to supply the filament (heater) voltage, with 2&nbsp;V common in early [[vacuum tube]] (valve) radio receivers.\n\nPortable batteries for miners' cap lamps [[Headlamp (outdoor)|headlamps]] typically have two or three cells.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cowlishaw, M.F. |title=The Characteristics and Use of Lead-Acid Cap Lamps |journal=Trans.

They have a large number of thin plates designed for maximum surface area, and therefore maximum current output, but which can easily be damaged by deep discharge. Repeated deep discharges will result in capacity loss and ultimately in premature failure, as the [[electrode]]s disintegrate due to [[mechanical stress]]es that arise from cycling.  Starting batteries kept on continuous float charge will have corrosion in the electrodes which will result in premature failure.  Starting batteries should be kept [[Open-circuit voltage|open circuit]] but charged regularly (at least once every two weeks) to prevent [[#Sulfation and desulfation|sulfation]].\n\nStarting batteries are lighter weight than deep cycle batteries of the same battery dimensions, because the cell plates do not extend all the way to the bottom of the battery case. This allows loose disintegrated lead to fall off the plates and collect under the cells, to prolong the service life of the battery. If this loose debris rises high enough it can touch the plates and lead to failure of a cell, resulting in loss of battery voltage and capacity.\n\n===Deep cycle batteries===\n{{Main|Deep cycle battery}}\nSpecially designed deep-cycle cells are much less susceptible to degradation due to cycling, and are required for applications where the batteries are regularly discharged, such as [[photovoltaic]] systems, [[electric vehicle]]s ([[forklift]], [[golf cart]], [[electric car]]s and other) and [[uninterruptible power supplies]]. These batteries have thicker plates that can deliver less ''peak current'', but can withstand frequent discharging.<ref>[http://www.windsun.com/Batteries/Battery_FAQ.htm \"Battery FAQ\" at ''Northern Arizona Wind & Sun'', visited 2006-07-23]</ref>\n\nSome batteries are designed as a compromise between starter (high-current) and deep cycle batteries. They are able to be discharged to a greater degree than automotive batteries, but less so than deep cycle batteries. They may be referred to as \"marine/motorhome\" batteries, or \"leisure batteries\".\n\n===Fast and slow charge and discharge===\n[[File:VRLA Overcharged using 12v 10A charger - Acid boiled out - case bulged and swelled.JPG|thumb|Charge current needs to match the ability of the battery to absorb the energy. Using too large a charge current on a small battery can lead to boiling and venting of the electrolyte. In this image a [[VRLA]] battery case has ballooned due to the high gas pressure developed during overcharge.]]\nThe capacity of a lead\u2013acid battery is not a fixed quantity but varies according to how quickly it is discharged.  An empirical relationship between discharge rate and capacity is known as [[Peukert's law]].\n\nWhen a battery is charged or discharged, only the reacting chemicals, which are at the interface between the electrodes and the electrolyte, are initially affected.  With time, the charge stored in the chemicals at the interface, often called \"interface charge\" or \"surface charge\", spreads by [[diffusion]] of these chemicals throughout the volume of the active material.\n\nConsider a battery that has been completely discharged (such as occurs when leaving the car lights on overnight, a current draw of about 6 amps).  If it then is given a fast charge for only a few minutes, the battery plates charge only near the interface between the plates and the electrolyte.  In this case the battery voltage might rise to a value near that of the charger voltage;  this causes the charging current to decrease significantly.  After a few hours this interface charge will spread to the volume of the electrode and electrolyte; this leads to an interface charge so low that it may be insufficient to start the car.<ref>{{cite book|last=Saslow|first=Wayne M.|title=Electricity, Magnetism, and Light|year=2002|publisher=Thomson Learning|location=Toronto|isbn=0-12-619455-6 |pages=302\u20134}}</ref>  As long as the charging voltage stays below the gassing voltage (about 14.4 volts in a normal lead\u2013acid battery), battery damage is unlikely, and in time the battery should return to a nominally charged state.\n\n==Valve regulated (VRLA)==\nIn a [[VRLA battery|valve regulated lead acid battery]] (VRLA) the hydrogen and oxygen produced in the cells largely recombine into water.  Leakage is minimal, although some electrolyte still escapes if the recombination cannot keep up with gas evolution. Since VRLA batteries do not require (and make impossible) regular checking of the electrolyte level, they have been called ''maintenance free batteries''.  However, this is somewhat of a misnomer.  VRLA cells do require maintenance.  As electrolyte is lost, VRLA cells \"dry-out\" and lose capacity. This can be detected by taking regular internal [[electrical resistance|resistance]], [[electrical conductance|conductance]] or [[electrical impedance|impedance]] measurements. Regular testing reveals whether more involved testing and maintenance is required.  Recent maintenance procedures have been developed allowing \"rehydration\", often restoring significant amounts of lost capacity.\n\nVRLA types became popular on motorcycles around 1983,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sudhan S.

Lead and lead dioxide, the active materials on the battery's plates, react with [[sulfuric acid]] in the electrolyte to form [[lead sulfate]]. The lead sulfate first forms in a finely divided, [[amorphous]] state, and easily reverts to lead, lead dioxide and sulfuric acid when the battery recharges. As batteries cycle through numerous discharges and charges, some lead sulfate is not recombined into electrolyte and slowly converts to a stable crystalline form that no longer dissolves on recharging. Thus, not all the lead is returned to the battery plates, and the amount of usable active material necessary for electricity generation declines over time.\n\nSulfation occurs in lead\u2013acid batteries when they are subjected to insufficient charging during normal operation. It  impedes recharging; sulfate deposits ultimately expand, cracking the plates and destroying the battery. Eventually so much of the battery plate area is unable to supply current that the battery capacity is greatly reduced. In addition, the sulfate portion (of the lead sulfate) is not returned to the electrolyte as sulfuric acid. It is believed that large crystals physically block the electrolyte from entering the pores of the plates. Sulfation can be avoided if the battery is fully recharged immediately after a discharge cycle.<ref>\nEqualize charging can prevent sulfation if performed prior to the lead sulfate forming crystals.\n{{cite book\n |editor1=Broussely, Michel |editor2=Pistoia, Gianfranco |title=Industrial applications of batteries: from cars to aerospace and energy storage\n |publisher=Elsevier\n |year=2007\n |isbn=0-444-52160-7\n |pages=502\u20133\n}}</ref> A white coating on the plates may be visible (in batteries with clear cases, or after dismantling the battery). Batteries that are sulfated show a high internal resistance and can deliver only a small fraction of normal discharge current. Sulfation also affects the charging cycle, resulting in longer charging times, less efficient and incomplete charging, and higher battery temperatures.\n\nSLI batteries (starting, lighting, ignition; i.e., car batteries) suffer most deterioration because vehicles normally stand unused for relatively long periods of time.  Deep cycle and motive power batteries are subjected to regular controlled overcharging, eventually failing due to corrosion of the positive plate grids rather than sulfation.\n\nThere are no known, independently verified ways to reverse sulfation.<ref name=\"Linden2002\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.batteryvitamin.net/sulfation_remedies_demystified |title=Sulfation Remedies Demystified}}</ref> There are commercial products claiming to achieve desulfation through various techniques (such as pulse charging), but there are no peer-reviewed publications verifying their claims. Sulfation prevention remains the best course of action, by periodically fully charging the lead-acid batteries.\n\n==Stratification==\nA typical lead\u2013acid battery contains a mixture with varying concentrations of water and acid. Sulfuric acid has a higher density than water, which causes the acid formed at the plates during charging to flow downward and collect at the bottom of the battery. Eventually the mixture will again reach uniform composition by [[Molecular diffusion|diffusion]], but this is a very slow process. Repeated cycles of partial charging and discharging will increase stratification of the electrolyte, reducing the capacity and performance of the battery because the lack of acid on top limits plate activation. The stratification also promotes corrosion on the upper half of the plates and sulfation at the bottom.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Henry A. Catherino |author2=Fred F. Feres |author3=Francisco Trinidad |year=2004|url=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/223280928_Sulfation_in_leadacid_batteries/file/d912f50fb37c2249fc.pdf |title=Sulfation in lead\u2013acid batteries|journal=Journal of Power Sources|volume= 129|pages= 113\u2013120|doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2003.11.003}}</ref>\n\nPeriodic overcharging creates gaseous reaction products at the plate, causing convection currents which mix the electrolyte and resolve the stratification. Mechanical stirring of the electrolyte would have the same effect. Batteries in moving vehicles are also subject to sloshing and splashing in the cells, as the vehicle accelerates, brakes, and turns.\n\n==Risk of explosion==\n[[Image:ExplodedBattery.jpeg|thumb|right|Car battery after explosion]]\n\nExcessive charging causes [[electrolysis]], emitting hydrogen and oxygen. This process is known as \"gassing\".  Wet cells have open vents to release any gas produced, and  [[VRLA|VRLA batteries]] rely on valves fitted to each cell.  [[catalysis|Catalytic]] caps are available for flooded cells to recombine hydrogen and oxygen. A VRLA cell normally recombines any [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] produced inside the cell, but malfunction or overheating may cause gas to build up. If this happens (for example, on overcharging) the valve vents the gas and normalizes the pressure, producing a characteristic acid smell. However, valves can fail, such as if dirt and debris accumulate, allowing pressure to build up.\n\nAccumulated hydrogen and oxygen sometimes ignite in an internal [[explosion]].  The force of the explosion can cause the battery's casing to burst, or cause its top to fly off, spraying acid and casing fragments. An explosion in one cell may ignite any combustible gas mixture in the remaining cells.  Similarly, in a poorly ventilated area, connecting or disconnecting a closed circuit (such as a load or a charger) to the battery terminals can also cause sparks and an explosion, if any gas was vented from the cells.\n\nThe cells of [[VRLA battery|VRLA batteries]] typically swell when the internal pressure rises. The deformation varies from cell to cell, and is greater at the ends where the walls are unsupported by other cells. Such over-pressurized batteries should be carefully isolated and discarded. Personnel working near batteries at risk for explosion should protect their eyes and exposed skin from burns due to spraying acid and fire by wearing a [[face shield]], [[overall]]s, and gloves. Using [[goggles]] instead of a [[face shield]] sacrifices safety by leaving the face exposed to possible flying acid, case or battery fragments, and heat from a potential explosion.\n\n==Environment==\n\n===Environmental concerns===\nAccording to a 2003 report entitled \"Getting the Lead Out\", by [[Environmental Defense]] and the Ecology Center of Ann Arbor, Mich., the batteries of vehicles on the road contained an estimated {{convert|2600000|MT}} of lead. Some lead compounds are extremely toxic. Long-term exposure to even tiny amounts of these compounds can cause brain and kidney damage, hearing impairment, and learning problems in children.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| url         = http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp13.pdf\n| title       = TOXICOLOGICAL PROFILE FOR LEAD\n| date        = August 2007\n| publisher   = CDC Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry\n| location    = USA\n| chapter     = 2.3 LEAD DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIPS \n| page        = 31\n| format      = pdf\n| accessdate  = 2013-09-26\n| quote       = These data suggest that certain subtle neurobehavioral effects in children may occur at very low PbBs.

While lead recycling is a well-established industry, more than {{convert|40000|MT}} ends up in landfills every year. According to the federal Toxic Release Inventory, another {{convert|70000|MT}} are released in the lead mining and manufacturing process.<ref>{{cite book |author1=DeCicco, John M. |author2=Kliesch, James | title = ACEEE's Green Book: The Environmental Guide to Cars and Trucks | isbn = 0-918249-45-7 }}</ref>\n\nAttempts are being made to develop alternatives (particularly for automotive use) because of concerns about the environmental consequences of improper disposal and of lead [[smelting]] operations, among other reasons. Alternatives are unlikely to displace them for applications such as engine starting or backup power systems, since the batteries, although heavy, are low-cost.\n\n===Recycling===\n{{See also|Automotive battery recycling}}\n[[File:Recycling lead in a lead-acid battery recovery facility.jpg|thumb|right|A worker recycling molten lead in a battery recycling facility.]]\nLead\u2013acid [[battery recycling]] is one of the most successful recycling programs in the world. In the United States 99% of all battery lead was recycled between 2009 and 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Battery Council International.|url=http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/batterycouncil.org/resource/resmgr/Press_Releases/Recycling_Study_Press_Releas.pdf|website=Battery Council|accessdate=26 August 2014}}</ref> An effective pollution control system is a necessity to prevent lead emission. Continuous improvement in battery [[recycling]] plants and furnace designs is required to keep pace with [[emission standard]]s for lead smelters.\n\n==Additives==\nChemical additives have been used ever since the lead\u2013acid battery became a commercial item, to reduce lead sulfate build up on plates and improve battery condition when added to the electrolyte of a vented lead\u2013acid battery. Such treatments are rarely, if ever, effective.<ref>http://museum.nist.gov/exhibits/adx2/partii.htm A dispute on battery additives when Dr. Vinal of the National Bureau of Standards reported on this for the National Better Business Bureau.</ref>\n\nTwo compounds used for such purposes are [[Epsom salts]] and [[EDTA]].  Epsom salts reduces the internal resistance in a weak or damaged battery and may allow a small amount of extended life. EDTA can be used to dissolve the [[sulfate]] deposits of heavily discharged plates. However, the dissolved material is then no longer available to participate in the normal charge/discharge cycle, so a battery temporarily revived with EDTA will have a reduced life expectancy.  Residual EDTA in the lead\u2013acid cell forms organic acids which will accelerate corrosion of the lead plates and internal connectors.\n\nThe active materials change physical form during charge/discharge, resulting in growth and distortion of the electrodes, and shedding of electrode into the electrolyte.  Once the active material has fallen out of the plates, it cannot be restored into position by any chemical treatment. Similarly, internal physical problems such as cracked plates, corroded connectors, or damaged separators cannot be restored chemically.\n\n==Corrosion problems==\n\nCorrosion of the external metal parts of the lead\u2013acid battery results from a chemical reaction of the battery terminals, lugs and connectors.\n\nCorrosion on the positive terminal is caused by electrolysis, due to a mismatch of metal alloys used in the manufacture of the battery terminal and cable connector. White corrosion is usually lead or [[zinc sulfate]] crystals. Aluminum connectors corrode to [[aluminum sulfate]]. Copper connectors produce blue and white corrosion crystals. Corrosion of a battery's terminals can be reduced by coating the terminals with petroleum jelly or a commercially available product made for the purpose.<ref>Horst Bauer (ed.) ''Automotive Handbook 4th Edition'', Robert Bosch GmBH, 1996, ISBN 0-8376-0333-1, page 805</ref>\n\nIf the battery is over-filled with water and electrolyte, thermal expansion can force some of the liquid out of the battery vents onto the top of the battery. This solution can then react with the lead and other metals in the battery connector and cause corrosion.\n\nThe electrolyte can weep from the plastic-to-lead seal where the battery terminals penetrate the plastic case.\n\nAcid fumes that vaporize through the vent caps, often caused by overcharging, and insufficient battery box ventilation can allow the sulfuric acid fumes to build up and react with the exposed metals.\n\n==Maintenance precautions==\n[[Ammonia]] can neutralize spilled battery acid. Surplus ammonia and water evaporate, leaving an [[ammonium sulfate]] residue. [[Sodium bicarbonate]] (baking soda) is also commonly used for this purpose.\n\n==Sizing nomenclature==\nWith the broad range of possible electrical attributes, a part number nomenclature is used by many battery manufacturers to convey basic information such as [[voltage]], [[ampere-hour]] capacity, and terminals.<ref>{{cite web | title=Battery Terminals | accessdate=2013-05-31 | url=http://www.batterysharks.com//Articles.asp?ID=258#5 }}</ref>  The format follows a pattern such as <mfg><voltage><capacity>.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
