Volta had determined that the most effective pair of dissimilar metals to produce electricity was [[zinc]] and [[silver]].  In 1861, [[Latimer Clark]] and Sir [[Charles Tilston Bright|Charles Bright]] coined the name \"volt\" for the unit of resistance.<ref>As names for units of various electrical quantities, Bright and Clark suggested \"ohma\" for voltage, \"farad\" for charge, \"galvat\" for current, and \"volt\" for resistance.
