Right: Indian broad gauge 1676mm (5 feet 6 inches).]]\n{{train topics}}\nIn [[rail transport]], '''track gauge''' is the spacing of the rails on a [[railway track]] and is measured between the inner faces of the load-bearing rails.\n\nAll vehicles on a network must have running gear that is compatible with the track gauge, and in the earliest days of railways the selection of a proposed railway's gauge was a key issue.\n\nAs the dominant parameter determining interoperability, it is still frequently used as a descriptor of a route or network.\n\nThere is a distinction between the nominal gauge and actual gauge at some locality, due to divergence of track components from the nominal. Railway engineers use a device, like a [[caliper]], to measure the actual gauge, and this device is also referred to as a track gauge.\n\n==Nominal track gauge==\nThe nominal track gauge is the distance between the inner faces of the rails. In current practice, it is specified at a certain distance below the rail head as the inner faces of the rail head (the ''gauge faces'') are not necessarily vertical.\n\nRolling stock on the network must have running gear ([[Wheelset (rail transport)|wheelsets]]) that are compatible with the gauge, and therefore the gauge is a key parameter in determining interoperability, but there are many others\u2014see below. In some cases in the earliest days of railways, the railway company saw itself as an infrastructure provider only, and independent hauliers provided wagons suited to the gauge. Colloquially the wagons might be referred to as \"four-foot gauge wagons\", say, if the track had a gauge of four feet. This nominal value does not equate to the flange spacing, as some freedom is allowed for.\n\nAn infrastructure manager might specify new or replacement track components at a slight variation from the nominal gauge for pragmatic reasons.\n\n==Units==\nTrack is defined in old [[Imperial unit]]s or in universally accepted [[metric unit]]s or [[International System of Units|SI]] units.\n\nImperial units were established in United Kingdom by ''The Weights and Measures of Act of 1824''. The [[United States customary units]] for length did not agree with the Imperial system until 1959, when one [[International yard]] was defined as 0.9144 meters, i.e. 1 foot as 0.3048 meter and 1 inch as 25.4&nbsp;mm.\n\nThe list shows the Imperial and other units that have been used for track gauge definitions:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Guidance was not at first provided except by human muscle power, but later a number of methods of guiding the wagons were employed. The rails had to be at a spacing that suited the wagon wheels.<ref name = lewis>M J T Lewis, ''Early Wooden Railways'', Routledge Keegan Paul, London, 1970</ref>\n\nThe timber rails wore rapidly and later flat cast-iron plates were provided to limit the wear. In some localities, the plates were made L-shaped, the upstand of the L providing the guidance; this is generally referred to as a \"plateway\".\n\nAs the guidance of the wagons was improved, short strings of wagons could be connected and pulled by horses, and the track could be extended from the immediate vicinity of the mine or quarry, typically to a navigable waterway. The wagons were built to a consistent pattern and the track would be made to suit the wagons: the gauge was more critical. The Penydarren Tramroad of 1802 in South Wales, a plateway, spaced these at {{Track gauge|4ft4in}} over the outside of the upstands.<ref name =\"  cragg\">R Cragg, ''Civil Engineering Heritage\u2014Wales and West Central'', Thomas Telford Publishing, London, 2nd edition 1997,  England, ISBN 0 7277 2576 9</ref>\n\n[[File:Chpr rail.jpg|thumb|right|Fish-belly cast-iron rails from the Cromford and High Peak Railway]]The Penydarren Tramroad probably carried the first journey by a locomotive, in 1804, and it was successful for the locomotive, but unsuccessful for the track: the plates were not strong enough to carry its weight. A considerable progressive step was made when cast iron ''edge rails'' were first employed; these had the major axis of the rail section configured vertically, giving a much stronger section to resist bending forces, and this was further improved when fish-belly rails were introduced.<ref name = earlyrailways>Andy Guy and Jim Rees, ''Early Railways 1569\u20131830'', Shire Publications in association with the National Railway Museum, Oxford, 2011, ISBN 978 0 74780 811 4</ref>\n\nEdge rails required a close match between rail spacing and the configuration of the wheelsets, and the importance of the gauge was reinforced. Railways were still seen as local concerns: there was no appreciation of a future connection to other lines, and selection of the track gauge was still a pragmatic decision based on local requirements and prejudices, and probably determined by existing local designs of (road) vehicles.\n\nThus, the [[Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway]] (1826) in the West of Scotland used {{Track gauge|4ft6in}};<ref name = martin>Don Martin, ''The Monkland and Kirkintilloch and Associated Railways'', Strathkelvin Public Libraries, Kirkintilloch, 1995, ISBN 0 904966 41 0</ref> the [[Dundee and Newtyle Railway]] (1831) in the north-east of Scotland adopted {{Track gauge|4ft6.5in}};<ref name = ferguson>Dr N Ferguson, The Dundee and Newtyle Railway including the Alyth and Blairgowrie Branches, The Oakwood Press, 1995, ISBN 0-85361-476-8.</ref> the [[Redruth and Chasewater Railway]] (1825) in Cornwall chose {{Track gauge|4ft}}.<ref>D B Barton, ''The Redruth and Chasewater Railway, 1824\u20131915'', D Bradford Barton Ltd, Truro, 2nd edition, 1966</ref>\n\nThe [[Arbroath and Forfar Railway]] opened in 1838 with a gauge of {{Track gauge|5ft6in}},<ref name = whishaw>[[Francis Whishaw]], ''The Railways of Great Britain and Ireland Practically Described and Illustrated'', 1842, reprint 1969, David & Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, ISBN 0-7153-4786-1</ref> and the [[Ulster Railway]] of 1839 used {{Track gauge|6ft2in}}<ref name = whishaw/>\n\n===The Stockton and Darlington Railway===\n[[File:Killingworth-locomotive.jpg|thumb|An early Stephenson locomotive]]Locomotives were being developed in the first decades of the nineteenth century; they took various forms, but [[George Stephenson]] developed a successful locomotive on the Killingworth Wagonway, where he worked. His designs were so successful that they became the standard, and when the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] was opened in 1825, it used his locomotives, with the same gauge as the Killingworth line, {{Track gauge|4ft8in}}.<ref name = tomlinson>W W Tomlinson, ''The North Eastern Railway, its Rise and Development'', Andrew Reid & Co, Newcastle upon Tyne, 1915</ref><ref name = wood>Nicholas Wood, ''A Practical Treatise on Rail-Roads'', Longman, Orme, Brown, Green and Longmans, London, Third edition, 1838</ref>\n\nThe Stockton and Darlington line was immensely successful, and when the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], the first intercity line, was promoted (it opened in 1830), it used the same gauge. It was also hugely successful, and the gauge (now eased to {{Track gauge|4ft8.5in}}<ref name = tomlinson/>), became the automatic choice: \"[[standard gauge]]\".\n\n===Broad gauge===\nThe Liverpool and Manchester was quickly followed by other trunk railways, with the [[Grand Junction Railway]] and the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] forming a huge critical mass of [[standard gauge]]. When Bristol promoters planned a line from London, they employed the innovative engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]. He decided on a wider gauge, to give greater stability, and the [[Great Western Railway]] adopted a gauge of {{Track gauge|7ft}}, later eased to {{Track gauge|7ft0.25in}}. This became known as ''[[broad gauge]]''. The GWR was successful and became greatly extended, directly and through friendly associated companies, widening the scope of broad gauge.\n\n===Gauge differences===\nAt the same time, other parts of Britain built railways to standard gauge, and British technology was exported to European countries and parts of North America, also using standard gauge. Britain polarised into areas that had [[Brunel gauge|broad gauge]] lines or standard gauge lines. In this context, standard gauge was referred to as ''narrow gauge'' to indicate the contrast. Some smaller concerns selected other non-standard gauges: the [[Eastern Counties Railway]] adopted {{Track gauge|5ft}}. Most of them converted to standard gauge at an early date, but the GWR's broad gauge continued to grow.\n\nThe larger railway companies wished to expand geographically, and large areas were considered to be under their control. When a new independent line was proposed to open up an unconnected area, the gauge was crucial in determining the allegiance that the line would adopt: if it was broad gauge, it must be friendly to the Great Western railway; if narrow (standard) gauge, it must favour the other companies. The battle to persuade or coerce that choice became very intense, and became referred to as \"the gauge wars\".\n\nAs passengers and freight between the gauges became increasingly important, the difficulty of moving from one gauge to the other \u2014 the ''[[break-of-gauge|break of gauge]]'' \u2013 became more prominent and more objectionable. In 1845 a [[Royal Commission on Railway Gauges]] was created to look into the growing problem and this led to the [[Regulating the Gauge of Railways Act 1846]],<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/HMG_Act_Reg1846.pdf\n| title =An Act for regulating the Gauge of Railways\n|date = 18 October 1846\n|accessdate =26 April 2010}}</ref> which forbade the construction of broad gauge lines unconnected with the broad gauge network, and the broad gauge network was eventually converted\u2014a process called [[gauge conversion]]\u2014to standard, progressively until 1892. The same Act mandated the gauge of {{Track gauge|5ft3in}} for use in Ireland.\n\n===Gauge selection in other countries===\n[[File:Different gauges in China Railway Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Different gauges, from left: {{Track gauge|1435mm}}, {{Track gauge|1000mm}}, and {{Track gauge|600mm}}, on display at the China Railway Museum in Beijing]]As railways were built in other countries, the gauge selected was pragmatic; the track would have to fit the rolling stock.  If locomotives were imported from elsewhere, especially in the early days, the track would be built to fit them.  In some cases standard gauge was adopted, but many countries or companies chose a different gauge as their national gauge, either by governmental policy, or as a matter of individual choice.  Government officials in Spain and Russia were concerned that the rail lines they were planning could be used by an invader, and purposely chose gauges that were different from their neighbors.{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nNarrow gauges were widely used in mountainous regions as construction costs tended to be lower and they provided for tighter turns that were often required. In some countries, multiple gauges were chosen by long-distance networks, particularly in India and Australia.{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\n===Couplers===\nTo keep the rail traffic compatible within a network, not only the track gauge needs to be the same, but also the [[Railway coupling|couplers]], at least for locomotive hauled vehicles. For this reason, all the standard gauge railways in Europe use the standard [[buffers and chain coupler]] for locomotive hauled vehicles, while narrow gauge railways use a variation of couplers, since they often are isolated from each other, so standardisation don't matter. Similarly standard gauge railways in North America, Canada and Mexico included, use the [[janney coupler]] or the compatible [[tightlock coupling]] for locomotive hauled equipment.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe terms ''standard gauge'', ''broad gauge'' and ''narrow gauge'' do not have any fixed meaning. A \"standard\" gauge is only standard in a geographical region where it is dominant, but it is generally understood to be {{Track gauge|sg}}. An infrastructure owner would be ill-advised to order track materials simply as \"standard gauge\", but would normally specify the required critical dimensions of the components.\n\n''Broad gauge'' and ''narrow gauge'' are relative to the generally adopted standard.\n\nIn the British area of influence in southern Africa, {{Track gauge|3ft6in|lk=on}} was widely adopted.\n\nThe terms ''[[structure gauge]]'' and ''[[loading gauge]]'' have little connection with track gauge. They are both widely used, but imprecise, terms. Structure gauge describes the cross-section envelope into which new or altered structures (bridges, lineside equipment etc.) must not encroach. Loading gauge is the corresponding cross-sectional profile within which rail vehicles and their loads must be contained. If an exceptional load or a new type of vehicle is being assessed to run, it must conform to the route's loading gauge.\n\nHistorically, a space between the two profiles was required to allow for dynamic effects, extreme wear and surveying tolerances, but in current practice, all tolerances are incorporated into the vehicle operating profile and no other allowance is necessary.\n\nNowadays, there are other parameters that must be assessed for ''interoperability'', including electro-magnetic compatibility, compliance with control system parameters, [[axle load]] and loading envelope.\n\nIn British practice, the space between the rails of a track is colloquially referred to as the \"four-foot\", and the space between two tracks the \"six-foot\", descriptions relating to the respective dimensions.\n\n=== Standard gauge ===\n{{Main article|Standard gauge}}\nIn common usage the term \"standard gauge\" refers to {{Track gauge|sg}}.\n\n=== Medium gauge ===\nThe term ''medium gauge'' had different meanings throughout history, depending on the local dominant gauge in use.\n* In Australia, {{Track gauge|3ft6in|lk=on}} and {{Track gauge|3ft|lk=on}} gauge railways are classified as medium gauge<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/ahc/publications/commission/books/linking-a-nation/chapter-4.html|title=Linking a Nation: Australia's transport and communications 1788-1970 - Chapter 4: Building Australia's First Railways, 1848-1873|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv/UQ:241160/s00855804_1983_11_4_113.pdf|format=PDF|title=Adoption of the 3ft. 6ins. gauge for queensland railways |year=1983|website=espace.library.uq.edu.au}}</ref> in order to make a distinction with [[standard gauge]] and the narrow gauges such as the widely used {{Track gauge|2ft|lk=on}} gauge sugar cane railways.\n* In India and [[Bangladesh]], [[broad gauge]] (BG) is the classification for the dominant [[Indian gauge]], Metre<ref>{{cite web|url=http://irfca.org/faq/faq-gauge.html#gauge|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Gauges in India|publisher=}}</ref> or medium <ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=195126|title=Planned development for transport sector|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicbuses.co.uk/india2.html|title=A Trip to India (Page 2.

Sugar cane and banana plantations are often served by narrow gauges such as {{Track gauge|2ft|lk=on}}, as there is little through traffic to other systems.\n\nThe most widely used narrow gauges on public railways are\n*  {{Track gauge|1067mm|lk=on}} (Southern and Central Africa, Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan, Philippines, parts of Australia, New Zealand, Honduras and Costa Rica.)\n*  {{Track gauge|1000mm|allk=on}} (SE Asia, {{convert|17000|km|mi|abbr=on}} in India, East Africa, South America and Central Europe).\n*  {{Track gauge|762mm|lk=on}} (formerly in [[Sri Lanka Railways|Sri Lanka]] [[Kelani Valley Line]] and Udapussellawa lines).\n\n===Break of gauge===\n{{Main article|Break-of-gauge|Variable gauge}}\n[[File:Break of gauge GWR Gloucester.jpg|thumb|A cartoon depicting the horrors of goods transfer at the break of gauge at Gloucester in 1843]]Through operation between railway networks with different gauges was originally impossible; goods had to be transhipped and passengers had to change trains. This was obviously a major obstacle to convenient transport, and in Great Britain, led to political intervention.\n\nOn narrow gauge lines, [[Rollbock]]s or [[transporter wagon]]s are used: standard gauge wagons are carried on narrow gauge lines on these special vehicles, generally with rails of the wider gauge to enable those vehicles to roll on and off at transfer points.\n\nOn the [[Transmongolian Railway]], Russia and Mongolia use {{Track gauge|1520mm|lk=on}} while China uses standard gauge. At the border, each carriage is lifted and its [[Bogie exchange|bogies are changed]].  The operation can take several hours for a whole train of many carriages.\n\nOther examples include crossings into or out of the former Soviet Union: Ukraine/Slovakia border on the Bratislava-L'viv train, and the Romania/Moldova border on the Chi\u015fin\u0103u-Bucharest train.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://lukashenko.blogspot.com/2007/02/break-of-gauge.html\n| title = Beyond Thunderdome: Iron Curtain 2k6\n| accessdate = 2007-10-10}}</ref>\n\nA system developed by [[Talgo]] and [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles]] (CAF) of Spain uses variable gauge [[wheelset (rail transport)|wheelsets]]; at the border between France and Spain, through passenger trains are drawn slowly through apparatus that alters the gauge of the wheels, which slide laterally on the axles.

This arose particularly when individual railway companies chose different gauges and were subsequently required to share a route; this is most commonly found at the approaches to city terminals, where land space is limited.\n\nTrains of different gauges sharing the same track can save considerable expense compared to using separate tracks for each gauge, but introduces complexities in track maintenance and signalling, and may require speed restrictions for some trains. If the difference between the two gauges is large enough, for example between  {{Track gauge|sg|allk=on}} and {{Track gauge|3ft6in|lk=on}}, three-rail dual-gauge is possible, but if not, for example between  {{Track gauge|3ft6in}} and  {{Track gauge|1000mm|allk=on}}, four-rail triple-gauge is used. Dual-gauge rail lines are used in Switzerland, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Japan, North Korea, Spain, Tunisia and Vietnam.\n\n[[File:Mixed gauge track Didcot.JPG|thumb|Reconstructed mixed-gauge track at [[Didcot Railway Museum]], England]]\nOn the GWR, there was an extended period between political intervention in 1846 that prevented major expansion of its {{Track gauge|7ft0.25in|lk=on}} [[broad gauge]]<ref group = note>The Act of Parliament did not prohibit expansion of the existing broad gauge system, but it had the indirect and delayed effect of forcing conformity with the \"standard\" gauge eventually</ref> and the final [[Track gauge conversion|gauge conversion]] to standard gauge in 1892.\n\nDuring this period, there were many locations where practicality required mixed gauge operation, and in station areas, the track configuration was extremely complex. This was compounded by the fact that the common rail had to be at the platform side in stations, so in many cases, standard-gauge trains needed to be switched from one side of the track to the other at the approach. A special fixed point arrangement was devised for the purpose, where the track layout was simple enough. Jenkins and Langley<ref name = jenkins>S C Jenkins and R C Langley, ''The West Cornwall Railway'', The Oakwood Press, Usk, 2002, ISBN 0 85361 589 6, page 66</ref> give an illustration and description.\n\nIn some cases, mixed gauge trains operated, conveying wagons of both gauges. For example, MacDermot<ref name = macdermot2>E T MacDermot, ''History of the Great Western Railway'', vol II: 1863\u20131921, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1931, p316</ref> says:\n\n<blockquote>In November 1871 a novelty in the shape of a ''mixed-gauge'' goods train was introduced between Truro and Penzance. It was worked by a narrow-gauge engine, and behind the narrow-gauge trucks came a broad-gauge match-truck with wide buffers and sliding shackles, followed by the broad-gauge trucks. Such trains continued to run in West Cornwall until the abolition of the Broad Gauge; they had to stop or come down to walking pace at all stations where fixed points existed and the narrow portion side-stepped to right or left.</blockquote>\n\n==Maintenance standards==\nInfrastructure owners specify permitted variances from the nominal gauge, and the required interventions when non-compliant gauge is detected. For example, the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] in the USA specifies that the actual gauge of track that is rated for a maximum of {{convert|60|mph|km/h|1|abbr=on}} must be between {{Track gauge|4ft8in|lk=on}} and {{Track gauge|4 ft 9<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;in (1,460&nbsp;mm)}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fra.dot.gov/downloads/safety/tss_compliance_manual_chapter_5_final_040107.pdf|title=Track Safety Standards Compliance Manual Chapter 5 Track Safety Standards Classes 1 through 5|publisher=Federal Railroad Administration|accessdate=26 February 2010}}</ref>\n<!-- :Or {{Track gauge|{{convert|4|ft|9+1/2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}}} -->\n\n==Dominant gauges==\nApproximately Fifty-five per cent of the world's railways use {{Track gauge|4ft8.5in|allk=on}}{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}.\n\n{{further information|List of track gauges}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

National projects include Australian and Indian efforts to create a uniform gauge. In India metre and narrow gauge rail lines are being converted to {{Track gauge|1676mm|lk=on}} broad gauge, though a number of new metro rail projects use standard gauge. In India all new main lines, the Dedicated Freight Corridor, and conventional lines are being built as {{Track gauge|1676mm}}  [[broad gauge]]. The [[European Union]] has set out to develop inter-operable freight and passenger rail networks across its area, and is seeking to standardise gauge, signalling and electrical power systems. As countries build [[High-speed rail]]s, they also tend to converge these rails' gauge to standard gauge, with the exceptions of Uzbekistan and Russia.\n\nEU funds have been dedicated to assist [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], and [[Estonia]] in the building of some key railway lines ([[Rail Baltica]]) of [[standard gauge]], and to assist Spain and Portugal in the construction of high-speed lines to connect Iberian cities to one another and to the French high-speed lines. The EU has developed plans for improved freight rail links between Spain, Portugal, and the rest of Europe.\n\nGauge conversion of existing lines is extremely expensive and it is likely that only primary trunk routes will be converted, with new strategic lines being built to standard gauge.{{citation needed|reason=it not decently cited, just speculation|date=May 2016}}\n\n===New lines===\nThe [[United Nations]] [[Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] (UNESCAP) is planning a [[Trans-Asian Railway]] that will link Europe and the Pacific, with a Northern Corridor from Europe to the Korean Peninsula, a Southern Corridor from Europe to Southeast Asia, and a North\u2013South corridor from Northern Europe to the Persian Gulf. All these would encounter breaks of gauge as they cross Asia. Current plans have mechanized facilities at the breaks of gauge to move [[Intermodal container|containers]] from train to train rather than widespread gauge conversion.\n\n* Lines for iron ore to [[Oakajee]] port in [[Western Australia]] are proposed to form a combined dual-gauge network.\n* Lines for iron ore to [[Kribi]] in [[Transport in Cameroon|Cameroon]] are likely to be {{Track gauge|1435mm|allk=on}} with a likely connection to the same port from the {{Track gauge|1000mm|allk=on}} Cameroon system.

In many cases narrow-gauge track is used for a temporary way because of the convenience in laying it and changing its location over unimproved ground.\n\nIn restricted spaces such as tunnels, the temporary way might be double track even though the tunnel will ultimately be single track. The [[Airport Link Company|Airport Rail Link]] in Sydney had construction trains of {{Track gauge|900mm|lk=on}} gauge, which were replaced by permanent tracks of {{Track gauge|1435mm}} gauge.\n\nDuring World War I trench warfare led to a relatively static disposition of infantry, requiring considerable logistics to bring them support staff and supplies (food, ammunition, earthworks materials, etc.). Dense light railway networks using temporary narrow gauge track sections were established by both sides for this purpose.<ref name = wolmar>Christian Wolmar, ''Engines of War: How Wars Were Won & Lost on the Railways'', Atlantic Books, London, 2010, ISBN 978 1 84887 172 4</ref>\n\nIn 1939 it was proposed to construct the western section of the [[Yunnan\u2013Burma Railway]] using a gauge of {{Track gauge|15.25in}}, since such tiny or \"toy\" gauge facilitates the [[Minimum railway curve radius|tightest of curves]] in difficult terrain.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49460166 |title=TOY RAILWAY. |newspaper=[[The Northern Standard]] |location=Darwin, NT |date=8 December 1939 |accessdate=5 December 2011 |page=15 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n== Timeline ==\n* {{Track gauge|4ft8.5in}} \u2013 1825 \u2013 chosen by [[George Stephenson]]\n* {{Track gauge|5ft}} \u2013 1827 \u2013 chosen by [[Horatio Allen]] for the [[South Carolina Canal and Railroad Company|South Carolina Canal and Rail Road Company]]\n* {{Track gauge|1ft11.5in}} \u2013 1836 \u2013 chosen by [[Henry Archer]] for the [[Festiniog Railway]] to easily navigate mountainous terrain (started Britain's first narrow gauge passenger service in 1865) (originally horse-drawn)\n* {{Track gauge|7ft0.25in}} \u2013 1838 \u2013 chosen by [[I.
