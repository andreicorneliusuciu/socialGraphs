Because the reaction had been initiated by trace [[oxygen]] contamination in their apparatus, the experiment was, at first, difficult to reproduce. It was not until 1935 that another ICI chemist, [[Michael Perrin]], developed this accident into a reproducible high-pressure synthesis for polyethylene that became the basis for industrial LDPE production beginning in 1939. Because polyethylene was found to have very low-loss properties at very high frequency radio waves, commercial distribution in Britain was suspended on the outbreak of World War II, secrecy imposed and the new process was used to produce insulation for UHF and SHF [[coaxial cable]]s of [[radar]] sets. During World War II, further research was done on the ICI process and in 1944 Bakelite Corporation at Sabine, Texas, and Du Pont at Charleston, West Virginia, began large-scale commercial production under license from ICI.<ref>{{cite news |date=July 1949 |title=Poly \u2013 The All Star Plastic |work=Popular Mechanics |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GtkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA126 |pages=125\u2013129 |volume=91 |issue=1 |accessdate=20 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe breakthrough landmark in the commercial production of polyethylene began with the development of [[catalyst]] that promote the polymerization at mild temperatures and pressures. The first of these was a [[chromium trioxide]]\u2013based catalyst discovered in 1951 by [[Robert Banks (chemist)|Robert Banks]] and [[J. Paul Hogan]] at [[Phillips Petroleum]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Handbook of Transition Metal Polymerization Catalysts |last1=Hoff |first1=Ray |last2=Mathers |first2=Robert T. |editor1-last=Hoff |editor1-first=Ray |editor2-last=Mathers |editor2-first=Robert T. |year=2010 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-470-13798-7 |doi=10.1002/9780470504437.ch10 |chapter=Chapter 10. Review of Phillips Chromium Catalyst for Ethylene Polymerization}}</ref> In 1953 the German chemist [[Karl Ziegler]] developed a catalytic system based on [[titanium]] [[halide]]s and organoaluminium compounds that worked at even milder conditions than the Phillips catalyst. The Phillips catalyst is less expensive and easier to work with, however, and both methods are heavily used industrially. By the end of the 1950s both the Phillips- and [[Ziegler-Natta catalyst|Ziegler]]-type catalysts were being used for HDPE production. In the 1970s, the Ziegler system was improved by the incorporation of [[magnesium chloride]].  Catalytic systems based on soluble catalysts, the [[metallocene]]s, were reported in 1976 by [[Walter Kaminsky]] and [[Hansj\u00f6rg Sinn]]. The Ziegler- and metallocene-based catalysts families have proven to be very flexible at copolymerizing ethylene with other [[olefin]]s and have become the basis for the wide range of polyethylene [[resin]]s available today, including [[very low density polyethylene]] and [[linear low-density polyethylene]]. Such resins, in the form of [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene#UHMWfiber|UHMWPE fibers]], have (as of 2005) begun to replace [[aramid]]s in many high-strength applications.\n\n==Properties==\nThe properties of polyethylene can be divided into mechanical, chemical, electrical, optical and thermal properties.<ref name=\"Kaiser\">{{cite book|last1= Kaiser|first1= Wolfgang|title= Kunststoffchemie f\u00fcr Ingenieure von der Synthese bis zur Anwendung|date=2011|publisher= Hanser|location=M\u00fcnchen|isbn= 978-3-446-43047-1|edition=3.}}</ref>\n\n=== Mechanical properties ===\nPolyethylene is of low strength, [[hardness]] and rigidity, but has a high [[ductility]] and [[impact strength]] as well as low friction. It shows strong [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] under persistent force, which can be reduced by addition of short fibers. It feels waxy when touched.\n\n=== Thermal properties ===\nThe usefulness of polyethylene is limited by its softening point of {{convert|80|C|F}} (HDPE, types of low crystalline softens earlier). For common commercial grades of medium- and high-density polyethylene the melting point is typically in the range {{convert|120|to|180|C|F}}. The melting point for average, commercial, low-density polyethylene is typically {{convert|105|to|115|C|F}}. These temperatures vary strongly with the type of polyethylene.\n\n===Chemical properties===\nPolyethylene consists of nonpolar, saturated, high molecular weight hydrocarbons. Therefore, its chemical behavior is similar to [[Kerosene|paraffin]]. The individual macromolecules are not [[covalent bond|covalently]] linked. Because of their symmetric molecular structure, they tend to crystallize; overall polyethylene is [[Crystallization of polymers|partially crystalline]]. Higher [[crystallinity]] increases [[density]] and mechanical and chemical stability.\n\nMost [[Low-density polyethylene|LDPE]], [[Medium-density polyethylene|MDPE]], and [[High-density polyethylene|HDPE]] grades have excellent chemical resistance, meaning they are not attacked by strong acids or strong bases, and are resistant to gentle oxidants and reducing agents. Crystalline samples do not dissolve at room temperature. Polyethylene (other than cross-linked polyethylene) usually can be dissolved at elevated temperatures in [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s such as [[toluene]] or [[xylene]], or in chlorinated solvents such as [[trichloroethane]] or [[trichlorobenzene]].<ref name=Ullmann>Kenneth S. Whiteley, T. Geoffrey Heggs, Hartmut Koch, Ralph L. Mawer, Wolfgang Immel, \"Polyolefins\" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'' 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a21_487}}</ref>\n\nPolyethylene absorbs almost no [[water]]. The gas and water vapor permeability (only polar gases) is lower than for most plastics; [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]] and [[flavorings]] on the other hand can pass it easily.\n\nPE can become brittle when exposed to sunlight, [[carbon black]] is usually used as a UV stabilizer.\n\nPolyethylene burns slowly with a blue flame having a yellow tip and gives off an odour of paraffin (similar to [[candle]] flame). The material continues burning on removal of the flame source and produces a drip.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boedeker.com/burntest.htm |title=How to Identify Plastic Materials Using The Burn Test |work=Boedeker Plastics |accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nPolyethylene can not be imprinted or stuck together without pretreatment.\n\n===Electrical properties===\nPolyethylene is a good [[electrical insulator]]. It offers good tracking resistance, however, it becomes easily electrostatically charged (which can be reduced by additions of graphite, [[carbon black]] or antistatic agents).\n\n===Optical properties ===\nDepending on thermal history and film thickness PE can vary between almost clear ([[transparency and translucency|transparent]]), milky-opaque ([[translucent]]) or [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]]. PE-LD thereby owns the largest, PE-LLD slightly lower and PE-HD the least transparency. Transparency is reduced by [[crystallite]]s, if they are larger than the wavelength of visible light.<ref>Chung, C. I. (2010)\u3000''Extrusion of Polymers: Theory and Practice''. 2nd ed..

Because the compound is highly reactive, the ethylene must be of high purity. Typical specifications are <5 ppm for water, oxygen, and other [[alkene]]s. Acceptable contaminants include N<sub>2</sub>, ethane (common precursor to ethylene), and methane. Ethylene is usually produced from petrochemical sources, but also is generated by dehydration of ethanol.<ref name=\"Ullmann\"/>\n\n===Polymerization===\nEthylene is a rather stable molecule that polymerizes only upon contact with catalysts. The conversion is highly [[exothermic]]. [[Coordination polymerization]] is the most pervasive technology, which means that metal chlorides or metal oxides are used. The most common catalysts consist of [[titanium(III) chloride]], the so-called [[Ziegler-Natta catalyst]]s. Another common catalyst is the [[Phillips catalyst]], prepared by depositing [[chromium trioxide|chromium(VI) oxide]] on silica.<ref name=\"Ullmann\"/> Polyethylene can be produced through [[radical polymerization]], but this route has only limited utility and typically requires high-pressure apparatus.\n\n==Joining==\nCommonly used methods for joining polyethylene parts together include:<ref name=\"pdl\">{{harvnb|Plastics Design Library||p=326}}.</ref>\n\n*[[Hot gas welding]]\n*[[Fasteners|Fastening]]\n*[[Infrared welding]]\n*[[Laser welding]]\n*[[Ultrasonic welding]]\n*[[Heat seal]]ing\n*[[Heat fusion]]\n\n[[Adhesive]]s and [[solvent]]s are rarely used because polyethylene is [[nonpolar]] and has a high resistance to solvents. [[Pressure-sensitive adhesive]]s (PSA) are feasible if the surface is [[flame treatment|flame treated]] or [[corona treatment|corona treated]].\nCommonly used adhesives include:<ref name=\"pdl\"/>\n\n*Dispersion of solvent-type PSAs\n*Polyurethane contact adhesives\n*Two-part [[polyurethane adhesive|polyurethane]] or [[epoxy adhesive]]s\n*[[Vinyl acetate]] [[copolymer]] [[hot melt adhesive]]s\n\n==Classification==\nPolyethylene is classified by its [[density]] and [[Branching (chemistry)|branching]]. Its mechanical properties depend significantly on variables such as the extent and type of branching, the crystal structure, and the [[molecular weight]]. There are several types of polyethylene:\n\n*[[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]] (UHMWPE)\n*Ultra-low-molecular-weight polyethylene (ULMWPE or PE-WAX)\n*High-molecular-weight polyethylene (HMWPE)\n*[[High-density polyethylene]] (HDPE)\n*High-density cross-linked polyethylene (HDXLPE)\n*[[Cross-linked polyethylene]] (PEX or XLPE)\n*[[Medium-density polyethylene]] (MDPE)\n*[[Linear low-density polyethylene]] (LLDPE)\n*[[Low-density polyethylene]] (LDPE)\n*Very-low-density polyethylene (VLDPE)\n*[[Chlorinated polyethylene]] (CPE)\n\nWith regard to sold volumes, the most important polyethylene grades are HDPE, LLDPE, and LDPE.\n\n===Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE)===\n{{main|Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene}}\n[[File:Stainless steel and ultra high molecular weight polythene hip replacement (9672239334).jpg|thumb|Stainless steel and ultra high molecular weight polythene hip replacement]]\nUHMWPE is polyethylene with a molecular weight numbering in the millions, usually between 3.5 and 7.5 million.<ref>Steven M. Kurtz, Ph.D. UHMWPE Biomaterials Handbook. Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene in Total Joint Replacement and Medical Devices. Third Edition, page=3</ref> The high molecular weight makes it a very [[toughness|tough]] material, but results in less efficient packing of the chains into the [[crystal structure]] as evidenced by densities of less than high-density polyethylene (for example, 0.930\u20130.935&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>). UHMWPE can be made through any catalyst technology, although Ziegler catalysts are most common. Because of its outstanding toughness and its cut, wear, and excellent chemical resistance, UHMWPE is used in a diverse range of applications. These include can- and [[bottle]]-handling machine parts, moving parts on weaving machines, bearings, gears, artificial joints, edge protection on ice rinks, and butchers' chopping boards. It is commonly used for the construction of articular portions of [[implant (medicine)|implants]] used for [[hip replacement|hip]] and [[knee replacement]]s. As [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene#UHMWfiber|fiber]], it competes with [[aramid]] in [[bulletproof vests]].\n\n===High-density polyethylene (HDPE)===\n{{main|High-density polyethylene}}\n[[File:Hdpe pipe installation.jpg|thumb|[[High-density polyethylene|HDPE]] pipe installation in storm drain project in [[Mexico]]]]\nHDPE is defined by a density of greater or equal to 0.941&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>. HDPE has a low degree of branching. The mostly linear molecules pack together well, so intermolecular forces are stronger than in highly branched polymers. HDPE can be produced by [[chromium]]/silica catalysts, [[Ziegler-Natta catalyst]]s or [[metallocene]] catalysts; by choosing catalysts and reaction conditions, the small amount of branching that does occur can be controlled. These catalysts prefer the formation of [[free radicals]] at the ends of the growing polyethylene molecules. They cause new ethylene monomers to add to the ends of the molecules, rather than along the middle, causing the growth of a linear chain.\n\nHDPE has high tensile strength. It is used in products and packaging such as milk jugs, detergent bottles, butter tubs, garbage containers, and water pipes. One-third of all toys are manufactured from HDPE. In 2007, the global HDPE consumption reached a volume of more than 30 million tons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/plastics/polyethylene-hdpe/ |title=Market Study: Polyethylene \u2013 HDPE |date=May 2012 |publisher=Ceresana Research |accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Cross-linked polyethylene (PEX or XLPE)===\n{{Main|Cross-linked polyethylene}}\nPEX is a medium- to high-density polyethylene containing [[cross-link]] bonds introduced into the polymer structure, changing the thermoplastic into a [[thermoset]]. The high-temperature properties of the polymer are improved, its flow is reduced, and its chemical resistance is enhanced. PEX is used in some potable-water plumbing systems because tubes made of the material can be expanded to fit over a metal nipple and it will slowly return to its original shape, forming a permanent, water-tight connection.\n\n===Medium-density polyethylene (MDPE)===\n{{Main|Medium-density polyethylene}}\nMDPE is defined by a density range of 0.926\u20130.940&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>. MDPE can be produced by chromium/silica catalysts, Ziegler-Natta catalysts, or metallocene catalysts. MDPE has good shock and drop resistance properties. It also is less notch-sensitive than HDPE; stress-cracking resistance is better than HDPE. MDPE is typically used in gas pipes and fittings, sacks, shrink film, packaging film, carrier bags, and screw closures.\n\n===Linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE)===\n{{Main|Linear low-density polyethylene}}\nLLDPE is defined by a density range of 0.915\u20130.925&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>. LLDPE is a substantially linear polymer with significant numbers of short branches, commonly made by [[copolymerization]] of ethylene with short-chain [[alpha-olefin]]s (for example, [[1-butene]], [[1-hexene]], and [[1-octene]]). LLDPE has higher tensile strength than LDPE, and it exhibits higher impact and [[puncture resistance]] than LDPE. Lower thickness (gauge) films can be blown, compared with LDPE, with better environmental stress-cracking resistance, but is not as easy to process. LLDPE is used in packaging, particularly film for bags and sheets. Lower thickness may be used compared to LDPE. It is used for cable coverings, toys, lids, buckets, containers, and pipe. While other applications are available, LLDPE is used predominantly in film applications due to its toughness, flexibility, and relative transparency. Product examples range from agricultural films, Saran wrap, and bubble wrap, to multilayer and composite films. In 2013, the world LLDPE market reached a volume of US$40 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/plastics/polyethylene-lldpe/ |title=Market Study: Polyethylene \u2013 LLDPE 2nd. edition |date=November 2014 |publisher=Ceresana |accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Low-density polyethylene (LDPE)===\n{{Main|Low-density polyethylene}}\nLDPE is defined by a density range of 0.910\u20130.940&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>. LDPE has a high degree of short- and long-chain branching, which means that the chains do not pack into the [[crystal structure]] as well. It has, therefore, less strong intermolecular forces as the [[instantaneous-dipole induced-dipole attraction]] is less. This results in a lower [[tensile strength]] and increased [[ductility]]. LDPE is created by [[Radical polymerization|free-radical polymerization]]. The high degree of branching with long chains gives molten LDPE unique and desirable flow properties. LDPE is used for both rigid containers and plastic film applications such as plastic bags and film wrap. In 2013, the global LDPE market had a volume of almost US$33 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/plastics/polyethylene-ldpe/ |title=Market Study: Polyethylene \u2013 LDPE (2nd edition) |date=October 2014 |publisher=Ceresana |accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe radical polymerization process used to make LDPE does not include a catalyst that \"supervises\" the radical sites on the growing PE chains. (In HDPE synthesis, the radical sites are at the ends of the PE chains, because the catalyst stabilizes their formation at the ends.) Secondary [[free radical|radicals]] (in the middle of a chain) are more stable than primary radicals (at the end of the chain), and tertiary radicals (at a branch point) are more stable yet. Each time an ethylene monomer is added, it creates a primary radical, but often these will rearrange to form more stable secondary or tertiary radicals. Addition of ethylene monomers to the secondary or tertiary sites creates branching.\n\n===Very-low-density polyethylene (VLDPE)===\nVLDPE is defined by a density range of 0.880\u20130.915&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>. VLDPE is a substantially linear polymer with high levels of short-chain branches, commonly made by copolymerization of ethylene with short-chain alpha-olefins (for example, 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene). VLDPE is most commonly produced using metallocene catalysts due to the greater co-monomer incorporation exhibited by these catalysts. VLDPEs are used for hose and tubing, ice and frozen food bags, food packaging and stretch wrap as well as impact modifiers when blended with other polymers.\n\nRecently, much research activity has focused on the nature and distribution of long chain branches in polyethylene. In HDPE, a relatively small number of these branches, perhaps one in 100 or 1,000 branches per backbone carbon, can significantly affect the [[rheology|rheological]] properties of the polymer.\n\n===Copolymers===\nIn addition to [[copolymerization]] with alpha-olefins, ethylene can also be copolymerized with a wide range of other monomers and ionic composition that creates ionized free radicals. Common examples include [[vinyl acetate]] (the resulting product is [[ethylene-vinyl acetate]] copolymer, or EVA, widely used in athletic-shoe sole foams) and a variety of [[acrylate]]s. Applications of [[Acrylic resin|acrylic]] [[copolymer]] include packaging and sporting goods, and [[superplasticizer]], used for cement production.\n\n=== Molecular structure of different PE types ===\nThe diverse material behavior of different types of polyethylene can be explained by their molecular structure. Molecular weight and crystallinity are having the biggest impact, the crystallinity in turn depends on molecular weight and degree of branching. The less the polymer chains are branched, and the smaller the molecular weight, the higher the crystallinity of polyethylene. The crystallinity is between 35% (PE-LD/PE-LLD) and 80% (PE-HD). Within crystallites polyethylene has a density of 1.0&nbsp;g\u00b7cm<sup>\u22123</sup>, in the amorphous regions of 0.86&nbsp;g\u00b7cm<sup>\u22123</sup>. Thus, an almost linear relationship exists between density and crystallinity.<ref name=\"Kaiser\" />\n\nThe degree of branching of the different types of polyethylene can be schematically represented as follows:<ref name=\"Kaiser\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| PE-HD || [[File:PE-HD schematic.svg|Schematic representation of PE-HD (high-density polyethylene).]]\n|-\n| PE-LLD ||\n[[File:PE-LLD schematic.svg|Schematic representation of PE-LLD (linear low-density polyethylene)]]\n|-\n| PE-LD || [[File:PE-LD schematic.svg|Schematic representation of PE-LD (low-density polyethylene).]]\n|}\n\n<small>The figure shows polyethylene backbones, short-chain branches and side chain branches. The polymer chains are represented linearly.</small>\n\n=== Chain branches ===\nThe properties of polyethylene are highly dependent on type and number of chain branches. The chain branches in turn depend on the process used: either the high-pressure process (only PE-LD) or the low-pressure process (all other PE grades). Low-density polyethylene is produced by the high-pressure process by radical polymerization, thereby numerous short chain branches as well as long chain branches are formed. Short chain branches are formed by [[intramolecular]] [[chain transfer]] reactions, they are always [[butyl group|butyl]] or [[ethyl group|ethyl]] chain branches because the reaction proceeds after the following mechanism:\n:[[File:PE-LD mechanism en.svg|Mechanism for the emergence of side chains during synthesis of polyethylene (PE-LD).]]\n\n==Environmental issues==\n[[File:Polyethylene.jpg|thumb|140|A bag manufactured from polyethylene]]\n{{cleanup|section|reason=unsourced, poorly sourced, and innacurate statements|date=September 2012}}\nAlthough ethylene can be produced from renewables, polyethylene is mainly made from petroleum or natural gas.\n\n===Biodegrading plastics===\nOne of the main problems of polyethylene is that without special treatment it is not readily biodegradable, and thus accumulates. In Japan, getting rid of plastics in an environmentally friendly way was the major problem discussed until the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima disaster]] in 2011. It was listed as a $90 billion market for solutions.

Common polymer-analogous reactions are in case of polyethylene [[Cross-link|crosslinking]], [[Chlorination reaction|chlorination]] and [[sulfochlorination]].\n\n=== Non-polar ethylene copolymers ===\n\n==== \u03b1-olefins ====\nIn the low pressure process [[Alpha-olefin|\u03b1-olefins]] (e.g. [[1-Butene|1-butene]] or [[1-Hexene|1-hexene]]) may be added, which are incorporated in the polymer chain during polymerization. These copolymers introduce short side chains, thus [[crystallinity]] and [[density]] are reduced. As explained above, mechanical and thermal properties are changed thereby. In particular, PE-LLD is produced this way.\n\n==== Metallocene polyethylene (PE-MC) ====\nMetallocene polyethylene (PE-M) is prepared by means of [[metallocene catalysts]], usually including copolymers (z. B. ethene / hexene). Metallocene polyethylene has a relatively narrow [[molecular weight distribution]], exceptionally high toughness, excellent optical properties and a uniform comonomer content. Because of the narrow molecular weight distribution it behaves less pseudoplastic (especially under larger shear rates). Metallocene polyethylene has a low proportion of low molecular weight (extractable) components and a low welding and sealing temperature. Thus, it is particularly suitable for the food industry.<ref name=\"Kaiser\" />{{rp|238}}<ref name=\"Vasile\">{{cite book|last1=Pascu|first1=Cornelia Vasile: Mihaela|title=Practical guide to polyethylene|date=2005|publisher=Rapra Technology Ltd.|location=Shawbury|isbn=1859574939|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}</ref>{{rp|19}}\n\n====Polyethylene with multimodal molecular weight distribution====\nPolyethylene with multimodal molecular weight distribution consists of several polymer fractions, which are homogeneously mixed. Such polyethylene types offer extremely high stiffness, toughness, strength, stress crack resistance and an increased crack propagation resistance. They consist of equal proportions higher and lower molekularerer polymer fractions. The lower molecular weight units crystallize easier and relax faster. The higher molecular weight fractions form linking molecules between crystallites, thereby increasing toughness and stress crack resistance. Polyethylene with multimodal molecular weight distribution can be prepared either in two-stage reactors, by catalysts with two different active centers on a carrier or by blending in extruders.<ref name=\"Kaiser\" />{{rp|238}}\n\n==== Cyclic olefin copolymers (COC) ====\n[[Cyclic olefin copolymer]]s are prepared by copolymerization of ethene and [[cycloolefin]]s (usually [[norbornene]]) produced by using metallocene catalysts. The resulting polymers are amorphous polymers and particularly transparent and heat resistant.<ref name=\"Kaiser\" />{{rp|239}}<ref name=\"Vasile\" />{{rp|27}}\n\n=== Polar ethylene copolymers ===\nThe basic compounds used as polar comonomers are vinyl alcohol ([[Vinyl alcohol|Ethenol]], an unsaturated alcohol), acrylic acid ([[propenoic acid]], an unsaturated acid) and [[ester]]s containing one of the two compounds.\n\n==== Ethylene copolymers with unsaturated alcohols ====\nEthylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) is (formally) a copolymer of PE and vinyl alcohol (ethenol), which is prepared by (partial) hydrolysis of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (as vinyl alcohol itself is not stable). However, typically EVOH has a higher comonomer content than the VAC commonly used.<ref name=\"Domininghaus\" />{{rp|239}}\n\nEVOH is used in multilayer films for packaging as a barrier layer (barrier plastic). As EVOH is hygroscopic (water-attracting), it absorbs water from the environment, whereby it loses its barrier effect. Therefore, it must be used as a core layer surrounded by other plastics (like LDPE, PP, PA or PET). EVOH is also used as a coating agent against corrosion at street lights, traffic light poles and noise protection walls.<ref name=\"Domininghaus\" />{{rp|239}}\n\n==== Ethylene/acrylic acid copolymers (EAA)  ====\nCopolymer of ethylene and unsaturated carboxylic acids (such as acrylic acid) are characterized by good adhesion to different materials, by resistance to stress cracking and high flexibility.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hirth|first1=von Hans Domininghaus; herausgegeben von Peter Elsner, Peter Eyerer, Thomas |title=Kunststoffe Eigenschaften und Anwendungen |date=2012|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |location=Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-642-16173-5 |edition=8.}}</ref> However, they are more sensitive to heat and oxidation than ethylene homopolymers. Ethylene/acrylic acid copolymers are used as [[adhesion promoter]]s.<ref name=\"Kaiser\" />\n\nIf salts of an unsaturated carboxylic acid are present in the polymer, thermo-reversible ion networks are formed, they are called [[ionomer]]s. Ionomers are highly transparent thermoplastics which are characterized by high adhesion to metals, high abrasion resistance and high water absorption.<ref name=\"Kaiser\" />\n\n=== Ethylene copolymers with unsaturated esters ===\nIf unsaturated esters are copolymerized with ethylene, either the alcohol moiety may be in the polymer backbone (as it is the case in ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer) or of the acid moiety (e. g. in ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymer). [[Ethylene-vinyl acetate]] copolymers are prepared similarly to LD-PE by high pressure polymerization. The proportion of comonomer has a decisive influence on the behaviour of the polymer.\n\nThe density decreases up to a comonomer share of 10% because of the disturbed crystal formation. With higher proportions it approaches to the one of [[polyvinyl acetate]] (1.17 g/cm<sup>3</sup>).<ref name=\"Domininghaus\" />{{rp|235}} Due to decreasing crystallinity ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers are getting softer with increasing comonomer content. The polar side groups change the chemical properties significantly (compared to polyethylene):<ref name=\"Kaiser\" />{{rp|224}} weather resistance, adhesiveness and weldability rise with comonomer content, while the chemical resistance decreases. Also mechanical properties are changed: stress cracking resistance and toughness in the cold rise, whereas yield stress and heat resistance decrease. With a very high proportion of comonomers (about 50%) rubbery thermoplastics are produced ([[thermoplastic elastomer]]s).<ref name=\"Domininghaus\" />{{rp|235}}\n\nEthylene-ethyl acrylate copolymers behave similarly to ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers.<ref name=\"Kaiser\" />{{rp|240}}\n\n=== Crosslinking ===\nVarious methods can used to prepare [[cross-linked polyethylene]] (PE-X) from thermoplastic polyethylene (PE-LD, PE-LLD or PE-HD). By crosslinking low-temperature impact strength, [[abrasion resistance]] and environmental stress cracking resistance can be increased significantly, whereas [[hardness]] and rigidity are somewhat reduced. PE-X does not melt anymore (analogous to elastomers) and is thermally resistant (over longer periods of up to 120&nbsp;\u00b0C, for short periods without mechanical load up to 250&nbsp;\u00b0C). With increasing crosslinking density also the maximum shear modulus increases (even at higher temperatures).<ref name=\"Domininghaus\">{{cite book|last1=Elsner |first1=Peter|last2=Eyerer |first2=Peter|last3=Hirth|first3=Thomas|title=Domininghaus - Kunststoffe|date=2012 |publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin Heidelberg |isbn=978-3-642-16173-5|edition=8. |page=224}}</ref><ref name=\"Saechtling\">{{cite book |last1=Baur|first1=Erwin |last2=Osswald|first2=Tim A. |title=Saechtling Kunststoff Taschenbuch |date=October 2013|isbn=978-3-446-43729-6 |page=443}} [https://www.kunststoffe.de/themen/basics/standardthermoplaste/polyethylen-pe/artikel/vernetztes-polyethylen-pe-x-820007.html Vorschau auf kunststoffe.de]</ref> PE-X has significantly enhanced properties compared with ordinary PE.<ref name=\"Koltzenburg\">{{cite book |last1=Koltzenburg|first1=Sebastian |last2=Maskos|first2=Michael|last3=Nuyken |first3=Oskar|title=Polymere: Synthese, Eigenschaften und Anwendungen |date=2014|publisher=Springer Spektrum |isbn=978-3-642-34773-3|page=406|edition=1}}</ref> As PE-X is infusible, always the final pre-products or the mold part are cross-linked.\n\n====Applications====\nPE-X is used as insulating material for medium and [[high voltage]] [[Insulator (electricity)|cable insulation]], for hot water pipes and molded parts in electrical engineering, plant engineering and in automotive industry.\n\n====Types of crosslinking====\nA basic distinction is made between peroxide crosslinking (PE-Xa), silane crosslinking (PE-Xb), electron beam crosslinking (PE-Xc) and azo crosslinking (PE-Xd).<ref name=\"Saechtling\" />\n\n[[File:Crosslinking PE scheme en.svg|frameless|upright=2.5|Shown are the peroxide, the silane and irradiation crosslinking]]\n\n<small>Shown are the peroxide, the silane and irradiation crosslinking.

Later Si-OH groups can be formed in a [[Laboratory water bath|water bath]] by [[hydrolysis]], which condense then and crosslink the PE by the formation of Si-O-Si bridges. [16] [[Catalyst]]s such as [[dibutyltin dilaurate]] may accelerate the reaction.<ref name=\"Ullmanns\" />\n*'''Irradiation crosslinking (PE-Xc)''': The crosslinking of polyethylene is also possible by a downstream radiation source (usually a [[electron accelerator]], occasionally a [[isotopic radiator]]). PE products are crosslinked below the crystalline melting point by splitting off [[hydrogen]] atoms. [[\u03b2-radiation]] possesses a [[penetration depth]] of 10 [[Millimetre|mm]], [[Gamma ray|\u0263-radiation]] 100&nbsp;mm. Thereby the interior or specific areas can be excluded from the crosslinking.<ref name=\"Saechtling\" /> However, due to high capital and operating costs radiation crosslinking plays only a minor role compared with the peroxide crosslinking.<ref name=\"Domininghaus\" /> In contrast to peroxide crosslinking, the process is carried out in the [[solid-state chemistry|solid state]].

It is used in blends with [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] because the soft, rubbery chloropolyethylene is embedded in the PVC matrix, thereby increasing the [[impact resistance]]. In addition, it also increases the weather resistance. Furthermore, it is used for softening PVC foils, without risking the migrate of plasticizers.
