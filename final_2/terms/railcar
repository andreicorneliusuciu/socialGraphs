The term \"railcar\" is usually used in reference to a train consisting of a single [[Coach (rail)|coach]] (carriage, car), with a driver's cab at one or both ends. Some railways, e.g., the [[Great Western Railway]], used the term [[Railmotor]]. If it is able to pull a full train, it is rather called a [[Rail motor coach|motor coach]] or a motor car.<ref>[http://www.parrypeoplemovers.com/ppm35-feature.htm www.parrypeoplemovers.com] Light Railcars and Railbuses  - Retrieved on 2008-06-09</ref>\n\nIn its simplest form it may be little more than a motorised version of a [[Handcar|railway handcar]], sometimes called a [[speeder]].\n\nThe term is sometimes also used as an alternative name for the small types of [[multiple unit]] which consist of more than one coach. The term is used more generally now in [[Ireland]] to refer to any [[diesel multiple unit]] (DMU), or in some cases [[electric multiple unit]] (EMU).\n\nIn North America the term \u201crailcar\u201d has a much broader meaning, and the term is used to refer to any kind of [[railway carriage]], including unpowered goods wagons.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brinckman|first=Jonathan|title=Railcar orders, jobs in jeopardy|date=March 6, 2009|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2009/03/railcar_orders_jobs_in_jeopard.html|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|accessdate=March 11, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Trinity Eyes Stimulus|url=http://www.joc.com/node/409559 |journal=[[The Journal of Commerce]] |accessdate=March 11, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Bill address railcar storage|url=http://www.billingsgazette.net/articles/2009/02/20/news/state/48-billaddress.txt |newspaper=[[Billings Gazette]] |accessdate=March 11, 2009}}</ref>\n[[Image:Waldbahn VT 15.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Stadler Regio-Shuttle RS1|Regio-Shuttle RS1]] low-floor vehicle is a modern version of a single unit railcar.

A famous example of this in the United States was the [[Galloping Goose (railcar)|Galloping Goose]] railcars of the [[Rio Grande Southern Railroad]], whose introduction allowed the discontinuance of steam passenger service on the line and prolonged its life considerably.\n\nRailcars have also been employed on premier services. In [[New Zealand]], although railcars were primarily used on regional services, the [[NZR RM class (88 seater)#Blue Streaks|Blue Streak]] and [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]] railcars were used on the [[North Island Main Trunk]] between [[Wellington]] and [[Auckland]] and offered a higher standard of service than previous carriage trains.\n\nIn [[Australia]], the ''[[Savannahlander]]'' operates a tourist service from the coastal town of [[Cairns]] to [[Forsayth, Queensland|Forsayth]], and [[Traveltrain]] operates the ''[[Gulflander]]'' between [[Normanton, Queensland|Normanton]] and [[Croydon, Queensland|Croydon]] in the [[Gulf Country]] of northern [[Queensland]].\n\n===Historic railcars===\n\n<gallery class=center>\nImage:Rail Motor Society CPH 1 (5).jpg| <center>CPH 1 diesel [[CPH railmotor|railmotor]] at Maitland Steamfest</center>\nFile:Triebwagen 802.jpg|An old narrow gauge railcar in [[Dubrovnik]], [[Croatia]], in 1967\n\nImage:NoELB Steam Railcar.jpg|An early steam railcar for the narrow gauge Nieder\u00f6sterreichische Landesbahn, built by Komarek of [[Vienna]] in 1903.

It is possible for several railcars to run together, each with its own driver (a practice of the [[County Donegal Railways Joint Committee]]). The reason for this was to keep costs down, since small railcars were not always fitted with multiple unit control.\n\nThere are also [[Articulated car|articulated railcars]], with bogies under the point between the carriages rather than two pivoting bogies under each carriage (see ''[[Jacobs bogie]]'').\n\n==New-generation DMU and EMU railcars==\n{{see also|Diesel multiple unit|Electric multiple unit|Light rail}}       \n[[Image:Beinwil am See Seetalbahn 2003-06-25 4528.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Stadler GTW]] light regional [[electric multiple unit]] railcar in [[Beinwil am See]]]]\n[[Image:Taunusbahn Brandoberndorf LINT.jpg|right|thumb|220px|A diesel Coradia LINT of the [[Taunusbahn (Hochtaunus)|Taunusbahn]] has arrived in [[Brandoberndorf]] station and now waits for departure to [[Bad Homburg]]]]\n[[File:Emepa Alerce train.jpg|220px|thumbnail|An [[Emepa Alerce]] on the [[Belgrano Norte]] line in [[Buenos Aires]].]]\n\nA new breed of modern lightweight aerodynamically designed diesel or electric regional railcars that can operate as single vehicles or in trains (or, in \u201cmultiple units\u201d) are becoming very popular in Europe and Japan, replacing the first-generation [[Railcar#Railbuses|railbuses]] and second-generation DMU railcars, usually running on lesser-used main-line railways and in some cases in exclusive lanes in urban areas.  Like many high-end DMUs, these vehicles are made of 2 or 3 connected units that are semi-permanently coupled as \u201cmarried pairs or triplets\u201d and operate as a single unit. Passengers may walk between the married pair units without having to open or pass through doors. Unit capacities range from 70 to over 300 seated passengers. The equipment is highly customisable with a wide variety of engine, transmission, coupler systems, and car lengths.\n\n===  Institutional/regulatory Issues ===\n\nContrary to other parts of the world, in the United States these vehicles generally do not comply with [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) regulations {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} and, therefore, can only operate on dedicated rights-of-way with complete separation between railroad activities.  This restriction makes it virtually impossible to operate them on existing rail corridors with conventional passenger rail service.  Nevertheless, such vehicles may soon operate in the United States as manufacturers such as [[Siemens]], [[Alstom]] and [[ADtranz]] affirm they may be able to produce FRA-compliant versions of their European equipment.{{fact|date=September 2016}}\n\n=== Existing systems ===\n\nThe light regional railcars are used by a number of railroads in Germany amongst others, and also in the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]], [[Italy]] and soon{{when|date=September 2016}} in Spain.\n* [[Sprinter (San Diego)|Sprinter]] in [[San Diego]], California\n* [[O-Train]] in [[Ottawa]], Canada\n* [[Capital MetroRail]] in [[Austin]], Texas\n* [[Ferrovia Trento-Mal\u00e8]] in the region of  [[Trento]], [[Italy]]\n* [[Ferrovia della Val Venosta]] in the province of [[South Tyrol]], Italy ''(\u2192 [[:it:Ferrovia della Val Venosta|it]])''\n* [[Ramal Talca-Constituci\u00f3n]] in the region of  [[Maule Region|Maule]], [[Chile]]\n\n===  Manufacturers ===\n\nModels of new generation multiple unit and articulated railcars include:\n* [[Alstom Coradia LINT]]\n* [[Bombardier Talent]]\n* [[Metrovagonmash]]\n* [[Siemens Desiro]]\n* [[Stadler GTW]]\n* [[Stadler FLIRT]]\n* [[Stadler Regio-Shuttle RS1]]\n\n==Railbuses==\n{{main|Railbus}}\n[[Image:HFJ-bussen har ankommit till Marielund.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Petrol railbus at the [[\u00d6stra S\u00f6dermanlands J\u00e4rnv\u00e4g|Eastern S\u00f6dermanlands Railway]], \u00d6SlJ, a narrow-gauge museum railway in typical time 1890-1910-century environment in [[Sweden]]]]\nA variation of railcar is a '''[[railbus]]''',  a very lightweight type of vehicle designed for use specifically on little-used railway lines, and as the name suggests share many aspects of their construction with a [[bus]], usually having a bus, or modified bus body, and having four wheels on a fixed base, instead of on [[bogie]]s. Railbuses were used commonly in countries such as Germany, [[Italy]], France, [[United Kingdom]], the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Sweden]].\n\nA type of railbus known as a [[pacer (train)|Pacer]] is still commonly used in the [[United Kingdom]]. New Zealand railcars that more closely resembled railbuses were the [[NZR RM class (Leyland diesel)|Leyland diesel railcars]] and the [[NZR RM class (Wairarapa)|Wairarapa railcars]] that were specially designed to operate over the [[Rimutaka Incline]] between Wellington and the [[Wairarapa]] region. In [[Australia]], where they were often called Rail Motors, railcars were often used for passenger services on lightly used lines. In France they are called an [[Autorail]]. Once very common their use died out as local lines were closed. However, a new model has been introduced for lesser used lines.\n\nAfter the cessation of [[BC Rail#Passenger services|mainline passenger service on BC Rail]] in [[Canada]], [[BC Rail]] started operating a pair of railbuses to some settlements not easily accessible otherwise.\n\nIn [[Russia]], [[Metrowagonmash]] of [[Mytishchi]] manufactures railbus RA-1 with a [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] engine. As of the summer 2006, the [[Gorky Railway]] planned to start using them on the commuter line between [[Nizhny Novgorod]] and [[Bor, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Bor]].<ref>[http://www.transp.nnov.ru/photo/railroad/ra1 \"Railbus RA-1 in Nizhny Novgord\"], on the site \"Public Transportation in Nizhny Novgorod\" {{ru icon}}</ref>\n\nA railbus runs on the [[Kalka-Shimla Railway]] route in India. Another railbus was in service on the [[Shimoga-Talguppa railway line|Shimoga-Talguppa]] route, but this was closed in June 2007 for [[Track gauge conversion|gauge conversion]] from {{Track gauge|1000mm|allk=on}} to {{Track gauge|66in|lk=on}} [[broad gauge]] under [[Unigauge|Project Unigauge]].\n\n<gallery class=center>\nImage:Baureihe 798 752-2.jpg|[[Uerdingen railbus]] in Germany\nImage:Railbus 79964 at York Railfest.JPG|Two axle [[British Rail Railbuses|British Rail Railbus]] in [[York]], England\nFile:Tren - Tecn\u00f3polis.JPG|An Argentine [[TecnoTren]] railbus\n</gallery>\n\n=== Road-rail vehicles ===\n{{main|Road-rail vehicle}}\nThe term '''railbus''' also refers to a dual-mode [[bus]] that can run on streets with rubber tires and on tracks with ''retractable'' [[Road-rail vehicle|HyRail]] train wheels.\n\n'''Railbus''' is also a term that refers to a ''bus'' that replaces or supplements rail services on low-patronage [[railway line]]s or a bus that terminates at a [[railway station]] (also called a train bus). This process is sometimes called [[bustitution]].\n\n==Parry People Movers==\nA UK company currently promoting the rail bus concept is [[Parry People Movers]]. Locomotive power is from the energy stored in a [[Flywheel energy storage|flywheel]]. The first production vehicles, designated as [[British Rail Class 139]], have a small onboard [[liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] motor to bring the flywheel up to speed. In practice, this could be an electric motor that need only connect to the power supply at stopping points. Alternatively, a motor at the stopping points could wind up the flywheel of each car as it stops.\n\n==Propulsion systems==\n\n===Steam===\n[[File:LNER Sentinel-Cammell steam rail-car (CJ Allen, Steel Highway, 1928).jpg|thumb|[[London and North Eastern Railway|LNER]] [[Sentinel Waggon Works|Sentinel-Cammell]] steam railcar]]\n{{main|Steam railcar}}\n[[William Bridges Adams]] built steam railcars at [[Bow, London]] in the 1840s. Many [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] railway companies tried steam railcars but they were not very successful and were often replaced by [[push-pull train]]s. [[Sentinel Waggon Works]] was one British builder of steam railcars.\n\nIn [[Belgium]], M. A. Cabany of [[Mechelen]] designed steam railcars. His first was built in 1877 and exhibited at a Paris exhibition. This may have been the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)]]. The steam boiler was supplied by the [[Boussu]] Works and there was accommodation for First, Second and Third-class passengers and their luggage. There was also a locker for dogs underneath! Fifteen were built and they worked mainly in the [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] and [[Antwerp]] districts.\n\n===Petrol===\nIn 1904 the Automotor Journal reported that one railway after another had been realising that motor coaches could be used to handle light traffic on their less important lines.<ref>\"Motor Coaches for Railways\", The Automotor Journal, January 23, 1904</ref> The North-Eastern railways had been experimenting \u201cfor some time\u201d in this direction, and [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]] provided them with a flat-four engine capable of up to {{convert|100|bhp|kW|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} for this purpose. The engine drove a main dynamo to power two electric drive motors, and a smaller dynamo to charge accumulators to power the interior lighting and allow electric starting of the engine. The controls for the dynamo allowed the coach to be driven from either end. For further details see [[1903 Petrol Electric Autocar]].\n\nAnother early railcar in the UK was designed by [[James Sidney Drewry]] and made by the [[Drewry Car Co.]] in 1906. In 1908 the manufacture was contracted out to the [[Birmingham Small Arms Company]].\n\n===Diesel===\nWhile early railcars were propelled by [[Steam engine|steam]], [[petrol engine|petrol]], and [[Diesel engine|diesel]] engines, modern railcars are usually propelled by a [[diesel engine]] mounted underneath the floor of the coach. Diesel railcars may have mechanical ([[fluid coupling]] and [[gearbox]]), hydraulic ([[torque converter]]) or [[Diesel-electric locomotive|diesel-electric]] transmission.\n\n===Electric===\nSingle electric railcars on mainline electric systems are rare, since electrification normally implies heavy usage where single cars would not be economic. The exceptions to this rule are to be found on [[tram]] and [[interurban]] systems, the [[Red Car]] of the [[Pacific Electric Railway]] being an iconic example.\n\n===Battery-electric===\n{{main|Accumulator railcar}}\nExperiments with battery-electric railcars were conducted from around 1890 in Belgium, France, Germany and Italy. In the USA, railcars of the [[Edison-Beach]] type, with [[nickel-iron battery|nickel-iron batteries]] were used from 1911. In New Zealand, a [[NZR RM class (Edison battery-electric)|battery-electric Edison railcar]] operated from 1926 to 1934. The Drumm [[nickel-zinc battery]] was used on four 2-car sets between 1932 and 1946 on [[Harcourt Street railway line|the Harcourt Street Line]] in [[Ireland]] and [[British Railways]] used [[lead-acid batteries]] in a [[British Rail BEMU|railcar in 1958]]. Between 1955 and 1995 [[Deutsche Bundesbahn|DB]] railways successfully operated 232 [[DB Class ETA 150]] railcars utilising [[lead-acid batteries]].\n\nAs with any other [[battery electric vehicle]], the [[drawback]] is the limited range (this can be solved using [[overhead wires]] to recharge for use in places where there are not wires), weight, and/or expense of the battery.\n\nAn example of a new application for [[zero emission vehicle]]s for rail environments such as subways is the [[Cater MetroTrolley]] which carries ultrasonic flaw detection instrumentation.\n\n==Draisine ==\nA Railcar could also mean a powered '''[[draisine]]'''\n<gallery class=center>\nImage:Metrotrolley.jpg|Battery electric MetroTrolley for rail use (for ultrasonic rail flaw detection)\nImage:USFSRailcarWilliams5171.JPG|In its simplest form, an American [[speeder]] - with motor unit detachable by hand\nImage:ATSFRailcarFairmontM-19-5173.JPG|With some weather protection, including mountable canvas side curtains\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n\n===Categories===\n{{div col|3}}\n* [[Autorail]]\n* [[Locomotive]]\n* [[Multiple unit]]\n* [[Railbus]]\n* [[Railmotor]]\n* [[Rail motor coach]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===General===\n{{div col|3}}\n* [[Air brake (rail)]]\n* [[Autorail]]\n* [[British Rail BEMU]]\n* [[British Rail Railbuses]]\n* [[Budd Rail Diesel Car]]\n* [[Budd SPV-2000]]\n* [[Cater MetroTrolley]]\n* [[CPH railmotor]]\n* [[DEB railcar]]\n* [[Diesel multiple unit]]\n* [[Doodlebug (rail car)]]\n* [[Draisine#Dressin, velorail or railbike|Draisine]]\n* [[EIKON International]]\n* [[Edwards Rail Car Company]]\n* [[GWR railcars]]\n* [[GWR steam rail motors]]\n* [[Handcar]]\n* [[Luxtorpeda]]\n* [[McKeen Motor Car Company]]<!--<br> pioneering US railcar builder / Data not really needed-->\n* [[Railmotor]]\n* [[Railroad car]]\n* [[brake (railway)|Railway brakes]]\n* [[Road-rail vehicle]]\n* [[Rail car mover]]- some of which<br> resemble [[Road-rail vehicle|HiRail trucks]].\n* [[Schienenzeppelin]]\n* [[Speeder]]\n* [[Stadler GTW]]\n* [[Unimog]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary}}\n{{commons category|Railcars (self-propelled)|Railcars}}\n* [http://www.fleetbodyequipment.com/index334e-2.html Fleet Body Equipment]\n* [http://www.railgear.com Rail-Gear (Boatright Enterprises, Inc)]\n* [http://www.wsr.org.uk/roadrail.htm The Road Rail Bus], an experimental bus for road and rail in the 1970s\n* [http://wilmingtonnrhs.com/ncra/index.html North Central Railcar Association (in Pennsylvania)]\n* [http://www.railmotorsociety.org.au/ Rail Motor Society (NSW, Australia)]\n* [http://www.stadlerrail.com/ Stadler Rail]\n* [http://www.narcoa.org/ North American Railcar Operators Association]\n* [http://www.nzetc.org/ Search site for ''railcar'' for photos of 1930s European and New Zealand Railcars]\n\n[[Category:Railcars| ]]\n[[Category:Multiple units]]"}]}}}}
