The spelling 'fibre' is common in British Commonwealth countries.\n\nCFRPs can be expensive to produce but are commonly used wherever high [[strength-to-weight ratio]] and rigidity are required, such as aerospace, automotive, civil engineering, sports goods and an increasing number of other consumer and technical applications.\n\nThe binding [[polymer]] is often a [[Thermosetting polymer|thermoset]] resin such as [[epoxy]], but other thermoset or [[thermoplastic]] polymers, such as [[polyester]], [[vinyl ester]] or [[nylon]], are sometimes used. The [[composite material|composite]] may contain other fibers, such as an [[aramid]] (e.g. [[Kevlar]], [[Twaron]]), [[aluminium]], [[ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]] (UHMWPE) or [[glass (fiber)|glass fibers]], as well as carbon fiber.  The properties of the final CFRP product can also be affected by the type of additives introduced to the binding matrix (the resin). The most frequent additive is silica, but other additives such as rubber and [[carbon nanotubes]] can be used.\nThe material is also referred to as ''graphite-reinforced polymer'' or ''graphite fiber-reinforced polymer'' (''GFRP'' is less common, as it clashes with glass-(fiber)-reinforced polymer).  In product advertisements, it is sometimes referred to simply as ''graphite fiber'' for short.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n==Properties==\n\nCFRPs are [[composite materials]]. In this case the composite consists of two parts: a matrix and a reinforcement. In CFRP the reinforcement is carbon fiber, which provides the strength. The matrix is usually a polymer resin, such as epoxy, to bind the reinforcements together.<ref>Kopeliovich, Dmitri. [http://www.substech.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=carbon_fiber_reinforced_polymer_composites Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer Composites]. substech.com</ref> Because CFRP consists of two distinct elements, the material properties depend on these two elements.\n\nThe reinforcement will give the CFRP its strength and rigidity; measured by [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] and [[elastic modulus]] respectively. Unlike [[Isotropy|isotropic]] materials like steel and aluminum, CFRP has directional strength properties. The properties of CFRP depend on the layouts of the carbon fiber and the proportion of the carbon fibers relative to the polymer.<ref>[http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cpr/v823/rpt/106099.pdf Basic Properties of Reference Crossply Carbon-Fiber Composite].

Although CFRPs with epoxy have high strength and elastic modulus, the brittle fracture mechanics present unique challenges to engineers in failure detection since failure occurs catastrophically.<ref name=\":1\" /> As such, recent efforts to toughen CFRPs include modifying the existing epoxy material and finding alternative polymer matrix. One such material with high promise is [[PEEK]], which exhibits an order of magnitude greater toughness with similar elastic modulus and tensile strength.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, PEEK is much more difficult to process and more expensive.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDespite its high initial strength-to-weight ratio, a design limitation of CFRP is its lack of a definable [[fatigue endurance limit]].  This means, theoretically, that stress cycle failure cannot be ruled out. While steel and many other structural metals and alloys do have estimable fatigue endurance limits, the complex failure modes of composites mean that the fatigue failure properties of CFRP are difficult to predict and design for. As a result, when using CFRP for critical cyclic-loading applications, engineers may need to design in considerable strength safety margins to provide suitable component reliability over its service life.\n\nEnvironmental effects such as temperature and humidity can have profound effects on the polymer-based composites, including most CFRPs. While CFRPs demonstrate excellent corrosion resistance, the effect of moisture at wide ranges of temperatures can lead to degradation of the mechanical properties of CFRPs, particularly at the matrix-fiber interface.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Temperature effect during humid ageing on interfaces of glass and carbon fibers reinforced epoxy composites|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021979705012701|journal = Journal of Colloid and Interface Science|date = 1 June 2006|pages = 111\u2013117|volume = 298|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.jcis.2005.12.023|pmid = 16386268|first = B.

For synthetic polymers such as PAN or rayon, the precursor is first [[Spinning (polymers)|spun]] into filament yarns, using chemical and mechanical processes to initially align the polymer chains in a way to enhance the final physical properties of the completed carbon fiber. Precursor compositions and mechanical processes used during spinning filament yarns may vary among manufacturers. After drawing or spinning, the polymer filament yarns are then heated to drive off non-carbon atoms ([[carbonization]]), producing the final carbon fiber. The carbon fibers filament yarns may be further treated to improve handling qualities, then wound on to [[bobbin]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zoltek.com/carbonfiber/how-is-it-made/ |title=How is it Made |publisher=Zoltek |accessdate=26 March 2015}}</ref>From these fibers, a unidirectional sheet is created. These sheets are layered onto each other in a quasi-isotropic layup, e.g. 0\u00b0, +60\u00b0 or \u221260\u00b0 relative to each other.\n\nFrom the elementary fiber, a bidirectional woven sheet can be created, i.e. a [[twill]] with a 2/2 weave. The process by which most CFRPs are made varies, depending on the piece being created, the finish (outside gloss) required, and how many of this particular piece are going to be produced. In addition, the choice of matrix can have a profound effect on the properties of the finished composite.\n\nMany CFRP parts are created with a single layer of carbon fabric that is backed with fiberglass. A tool called a chopper gun is used to quickly create these composite parts. Once a thin shell is created out of carbon fiber, the chopper gun cuts rolls of fiberglass into short lengths and sprays resin at the same time, so that the fiberglass and resin are mixed on the spot. The resin is either external mix, wherein the hardener and resin are sprayed separately, or internal mixed, which requires cleaning after every use.\nManufacturing methods may include the following:\n\n===Molding===\n\nOne method of producing CFRP parts is by layering sheets of carbon fiber cloth into a [[Molding (process)|mold]] in the shape of the final product. The alignment and weave of the cloth fibers is chosen to optimize the strength and stiffness properties of the resulting material. The mold is then filled with [[epoxy]] and is heated or air-cured. The resulting part is very corrosion-resistant, stiff, and strong for its weight.  Parts used in less critical areas are manufactured by draping cloth over a mold, with epoxy either preimpregnated into the fibers (also known as ''[[pre-preg]]'') or \"painted\" over it. High-performance parts using single molds are often vacuum-bagged and/or [[Autoclave (industrial)|autoclave]]-cured, because even small air bubbles in the material will reduce strength. An alternative to the autoclave method is to use internal pressure via inflatable air bladders or [[Polystyrene|EPS foam]] inside the non-cured laid-up carbon fiber.\n\n===Vacuum bagging===\n\nFor simple pieces of which relatively few copies are needed (1\u20132 per day), a [[vacuum bag]] can be used. A fiberglass, carbon fiber or aluminum mold is polished and waxed, and has a release agent applied before the fabric and resin are applied, and the vacuum is pulled and set aside to allow the piece to cure (harden). There are three ways to apply the resin to the fabric in a vacuum mold.\n\nThe first method is manual and called a wet layup, where the two-part resin is mixed and applied before being laid in the mold and placed in the bag. The other one is done by infusion, where the dry fabric and mold are placed inside the bag while the vacuum pulls the resin through a small tube into the bag, then through a tube with holes or something similar to evenly spread the resin throughout the fabric. Wire loom works perfectly for a tube that requires holes inside the bag. Both of these methods of applying resin require hand work to spread the resin evenly for a glossy finish with very small pin-holes.\n\nA third method of constructing composite materials is known as a dry layup. Here, the carbon fiber material is already impregnated with resin (pre-preg) and is applied to the mold in a similar fashion to adhesive film. The assembly is then placed in a vacuum to cure. The dry layup method has the least amount of resin waste and can achieve lighter constructions than wet layup. Also, because larger amounts of resin are more difficult to bleed out with wet layup methods, pre-preg parts generally have fewer pinholes. Pinhole elimination with minimal resin amounts generally require the use of [[autoclave]] pressures to purge the residual gases out.\n\n===Compression molding===\n\nA quicker method uses a [[Compression molding|compression mold]]. This is a two-piece (male and female) mold usually made out of aluminum or steel that is pressed together with the fabric and resin between the two. The benefit is the speed of the entire process. Some car manufacturers, such as BMW, claimed to be able to cycle a new part every 80 seconds. However, this technique has a very high initial cost since the molds require CNC machining of very high precision.\n\n===Filament winding===\n\nFor difficult or convoluted shapes, a [[filament winding|filament winder]] can be used to make CFRP parts by winding filaments around a mandrel or a core.\n\n==Applications==\nApplications for CFRP include the following:\n\n===Aerospace engineering===\n[[File:FIN A350 OH-LWA 7oct15 LFBO-2.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Finnair]] Airbus A350 using 52% composite materials]]\nThe [[Airbus A350 XWB]] is built of 52% CFRP<ref name=\"presentation\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eads.com/xml/content/OF00000000400004/7/19/41508197.pdf |title=Taking the lead: A350XWB presentation |publisher=EADS |date=December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327094646/http://www.eads.com/xml/content/OF00000000400004/7/19/41508197.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009}}</ref> including wing spars and fuselage components, overtaking the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]], for the aircraft with the highest weight ratio for CFRP, which was held at 50%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/articles/qtr_4_06/article_04_2.html |title=AERO \u2013 Boeing 787 from the Ground Up |publisher=Boeing |year=2006 |accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref> This was one of the first commercial aircraft to have the wing spars made from composites.

A recurrent problem is the structural ageing monitoring, for which new methods are constantly investigated, due to the multi-material and anisotropy unusual nature of CFRP.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/206768/files/EPFL_TH6422.pdf |first1=Enrique |last1=Guzman |first2=Thomas (dir.)|last2=Gm\u00fcr  |title=A Novel Structural Health Monitoring Method for Full-Scale CFRP Structures |publisher=EPFL PhD thesis |year=2014 |doi=10.5075/epfl-thesis-6422}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 a ''Hyfil'' carbon-fiber fan assembly was in service on the [[Rolls-Royce Conway]]s of the [[Vickers VC10]]s operated by [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%202107.html?search=rolls-royce%20rb211%20hyfil |title=Engines|journal=Flight International |date=26 September 1968}}</ref>\n\nSpecialist aircraft designer and manufacturer [[Scaled Composites]] have made extensive use of CFRP throughout their design range including the first private manned spacecraft [[Spaceship One]].\nCFRP is widely used in [[micro air vehicle]]s (MAVs) because of its high strength to weight ratio.\n\n[[SpaceX]] is using carbon fiber for the entire primary structure of their new [[super heavy-lift launch vehicle]], the [[ITS launch vehicle]]\u2014as well as the two very large [[spacecraft]] that will be launched by it, the ''[[Interplanetary Spaceship]]'' and the ''[[ITS tanker]]''.

Race-car manufacturers have also developed methods to give carbon fiber pieces strength in a certain direction, making it strong in a load-bearing direction, but weak in directions where little or no load would be placed on the member. Conversely, manufacturers developed omnidirectional carbon fiber weaves that apply strength in all directions. This type of carbon fiber assembly is most widely used in the \"safety cell\" [[monocoque]] chassis assembly of high-performance race-cars.\n\nMany [[supercar]]s over the past few decades have incorporated CFRP extensively in their manufacture, using it for their [[monocoque]] chassis as well as other components.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/162582-bmw-i3-will-bmws-new-ev-finally-be-the-breakthrough-for-carbon-fiber-cars |work=Extreme Tech |title=BMW i3: Cheap, mass-produced carbon fiber cars finally come of age |first=Bill |last=Howard |date=30 July 2013 |accessdate=31 July 2015}}</ref> As far back as 1971, the [[Citro\u00ebn SM]] offered optional lightweight carbon fiber wheels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jalopnik.com/michelin-made-carbon-fiber-wheels-for-citroen-back-in-1-1543922374 |title=Michelin Made Carbon Fiber Wheels For Citro\u00ebn Back In 1971 |first=M\u00e1t\u00e9 |last=Petr\u00e1ny |work=Jalopnik |date=17 March 2014 |accessdate=31 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hemmings.com/hmn/stories/2007/04/01/hmn_feature23.html |title=Reinventing the Wheel Leave it to Citro\u00ebn to bring the world's first resin wheels to market |first=David |last=L:aChance |work=Hemmings |date=April 2007 |accessdate=14 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nUntil recently, the material has had limited use in mass-produced cars because of the expense involved in terms of materials, equipment, and the relatively limited pool of individuals with expertise in working with it. Recently, several mainstream vehicle manufacturers have started to use CFRP in everyday road cars.\n\nUse of the material has been more readily adopted by low-volume manufacturers who used it primarily for creating body-panels for some of their high-end cars due to its increased strength and decreased weight compared with the [[glass-reinforced polymer]] they used for the majority of their products.\n\nUse of carbon fiber in a vehicle can appreciably reduce the weight and hence the size of its frame. This will also facilitate designers' and engineers' creativity and allow more in-cabin space for commuters. A preference for carbon fiber can also reduce the amount of water and electricity used in manufacturing.<ref>Hammond, Lou Ann (August 2013) [http://www.drivingthenation.com/?p=8523 BMW/SGL \u2013 Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP)]. Driving the Nation</ref>\n\n===Civil engineering===\n{{further2|[[Fibre-reinforced plastic#Structural applications of FRP|Structural applications of FRP]]}}\nCFRP has become a notable material in [[structural engineering]] applications. Studied in an academic context as to its potential benefits in construction, it has also proved itself cost-effective in a number of field applications strengthening concrete, masonry, steel, cast iron, and timber structures. Its use in industry can be either for retrofitting to strengthen an existing structure or as an alternative reinforcing (or pre-stressing) material instead of steel from the outset of a project.\n\n[[Retrofitting]] has become the increasingly dominant use of the material in civil engineering, and applications include increasing the load capacity of old structures (such as [[bridge]]s) that were designed to tolerate far lower service loads than they are experiencing today, seismic retrofitting, and repair of damaged structures. Retrofitting is popular in many instances as the cost of replacing the deficient structure can greatly exceed its strengthening using CFRP.<ref>Ismail, N. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231749/http://www.najif.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/cfrp-paper.pdf \"Strengthening of bridges using CFRP composites.\"] najif.net.</ref>\n\nApplied to reinforced concrete structures for flexure, CFRP typically has a large impact on strength (doubling or more the strength of the section is not uncommon), but only a moderate increase in stiffness (perhaps a 10% increase).  This is because the material used in this application is typically very strong (e.g., 3000 MPa ultimate [[tensile strength]], more than 10 times mild steel) but not particularly stiff (150 to 250 GPa, a little less than steel, is typical).  As a consequence, only small cross-sectional areas of the material are used.  Small areas of very high strength but moderate stiffness material will significantly increase strength, but not stiffness.\n\nCFRP can also be applied to enhance shear strength of reinforced concrete by wrapping fabrics or fibers around the section to be strengthened.  Wrapping around sections (such as bridge or building columns) can also enhance the ductility of the section, greatly increasing the resistance to collapse under earthquake loading.  Such 'seismic retrofit' is the major application in earthquake-prone areas, since it is much more economic than alternative methods.\n\nIf a column is circular (or nearly so) an increase in axial capacity is also achieved by wrapping.  In this application, the confinement of the CFRP wrap enhances the compressive strength of the concrete.  However, although large increases are achieved in the ultimate collapse load, the concrete will crack at only slightly enhanced load, meaning that this application is only occasionally used.\n\nSpecialist ultra-high modulus CFRP (with tensile modulus of 420 GPa or more) is one of the few practical methods of strengthening cast-iron beams.  In typical use, it is bonded to the tensile flange of the section, both increasing the stiffness of the section and lowering the [[neutral axis]], thus greatly reducing the maximum tensile stress in the cast iron.\n\nWhen used as a replacement for steel, CFRP bars could be used to reinforce concrete structures; however, this application is not common.\n\nCFRP could be used as pre-stressing materials due to their high strength. The advantages of CFRP over steel as a pre-stressing material, namely its light weight and corrosion resistance, should enable the material to be used for niche applications such as in offshore environments.  However, there are practical difficulties in anchorage of carbon fiber strands and applications of this are rare.\n\nIn the United States, pre-stressed concrete cylinder pipes (PCCP) account for a vast majority of water transmission mains. Due to their large diameters, failures of PCCP are usually catastrophic and affect large populations. Approximately {{convert|19000|mi}} of PCCP have been installed between 1940 and 2006. Corrosion in the form of hydrogen embrittlement has been blamed for the gradual deterioration of the pre-stressing wires in many PCCP lines. Over the past decade, CFRPs have been utilized to internally line PCCP, resulting in a fully structural strengthening system. Inside a PCCP line, the CFRP liner acts as a barrier that controls the level of strain experienced by the steel cylinder in the host pipe. The composite liner enables the steel cylinder to perform within its elastic range, to ensure the pipeline's long-term performance is maintained. CFRP liner designs are based on strain compatibility between the liner and host pipe.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rahman, S.|date=November 2008|title=Don't Stress Over Prestressed Concrete Cylinder Pipe Failures |journal=Opflow Magazine|pages=10\u201315|url=http://www.awwa.org/publications/opflow/abstract/articleid/18373.aspx|volume=34|issue=11}}</ref>\n\nCFRP is a more costly material than its counterparts in the construction industry, glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) and aramid fiber-reinforced polymer (AFRP), though CFRP is, in general, regarded as having superior properties.\n\nMuch research continues to be done on using CFRP both for retrofitting and as an alternative to steel as a reinforcing or pre-stressing material. Cost remains an issue and long-term durability questions still remain. Some are concerned about the brittle nature of CFRP, in contrast to the ductility of steel. Though design codes have been drawn up by institutions such as the American Concrete Institute, there remains some hesitation among the engineering community about implementing these alternative materials. In part, this is due to a lack of standardization and the proprietary nature of the fiber and resin combinations on the market.\n\n===Carbon fiber microelectrodes===\n\nCarbon fibers are used for fabrication of carbon-fiber [[microelectrodes]]. In this application typically a single carbon fiber with diameter of 5\u20137 \u03bcm is sealed in a glass capillary.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pike|first=Carolyn M.|author2=Grabner, Chad P. |author3=Harkins, Amy B. |title=Fabrication of Amperometric Electrodes|journal=Journal of Visualized Experiments|date=4 May 2009|issue=27|doi=10.3791/1040}}</ref> At the tip the capillary is either sealed with epoxy and polished to make carbon-fiber disk microelectrode or the fiber is cut to a length of 75\u2013150 \u03bcm to make carbon-fiber cylinder electrode.

For the same strength, a CFRP [[bicycle frame]] weighs less than one of [[steel]], [[aluminum]], or [[titanium]]. The type and orientation of the carbon-fiber weave can be designed to maximize stiffness and minimize the chance of failure. The variety of shapes it can be built into has further increased stiffness and also allowed [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] tube sections. CFRP frames, [[Bicycle fork|forks]] including suspension fork crowns and steerers, [[Bicycle handlebar|handlebars]], [[seatpost]]s, and [[crankset|crank arm]]s are becoming more common on medium as well as higher-priced bicycles. CFRP [[Bicycle wheel|wheels]], while expensive, are also becoming popular. The higher yield strength of the CFRP rims compared to aluminium reduces the need to re-true a wheel, and the reduced mass of the rim also reduces the [[moment of inertia]] of the wheel, since it is a rotating component. Rarely, the spokes of the wheel can be made from CFRP, but most carbon wheelsets still use traditional stainless steel spokes. Some other less common uses of CFRP on bicycles include derailleur parts, brake and shifter levers and lever bodies, cassette sprocket carriers, suspension linkages, disc brake rotors, pedals, shoe soles, and saddle rails.\n\nCFRP is used in squash, tennis and badminton racquets, [[sport kite]] spars, high quality arrow shafts, hockey sticks, fishing rods, [[surfboard]]s and [[Racing shell|rowing shells]].  Amputee athletes such as [[Oscar Pistorius]] use carbon fiber blades for running. It is used as a shank plate in some [[basketball]] sneakers to keep the foot stable, usually running the length of the shoe just above the sole and left exposed in some areas, usually in the arch.\n\nIn 2006, cricket bats with a thin carbon-fiber layer on the back were introduced and used in competitive matches by high-profile players including [[Ricky Ponting]] and [[Michael Hussey]]. The carbon fiber was claimed merely to increase the durability of the bats but was banned from all first-class matches by the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netcomposites.com/newspic.asp?3612 |title=ICC and Kookaburra Agree to Withdrawal of Carbon Bat |publisher=NetComposites |date=19 February 2006 |accessdate=13 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nAlthough lighter and stiffer than items made of traditional metals, CFRP may, under some circumstances, show significant rates of cracking and failure.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://bicycling.com/blogs/boulderreport/2012/01/16/the-perils-of-progress/|title=The Perils of Progress |journal=Bicycling Magazine |accessdate=16 February 2013 |date=16 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bustedcarbon.com/|title=Busted Carbon blog|accessdate=16 February 2013}} Bustedcarbon.com</ref> This can occur because of impact or over-torquing or improper installation of components.

This reduces the weight by up to 50% compared to metal bogies, which contributes to energy savings.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/traction-rolling-stock/single-view/view/carbon-fibre-reinforced-plastic-bogies-on-test.html |title=Carbon fibre reinforced plastic bogies on test |work=Railway Gazette |date=7 August 2016 |access-date=9 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Disposal and recycling==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}\nCFRPs have a long service lifetime when protected from the sun.  When it is time to decommission CFRPs, they cannot be melted down in air like many metals.  When free of vinyl (PVC or [[polyvinyl chloride]]) and other [[halogenated polymers]], CFRPs can be thermally decomposed via [[thermal depolymerization]] in an oxygen-free environment.  This can be accomplished in a refinery in a one-step process.  Capture and reuse of the carbon and monomers is then possible.  CFRPs can also be milled or shredded at low temperature to reclaim the carbon fiber; however, this process shortens the fibers dramatically. Just as with [[downcycling|downcycled]] paper, the shortened fibers cause the recycled material to be weaker than the original material. There are still many industrial applications that do not need the strength of full-length carbon fiber reinforcement. For example, chopped reclaimed carbon fiber can be used in consumer electronics, such as laptops.  It provides excellent reinforcement of the polymers used even if it lacks the strength-to-weight ratio of an aerospace component.\n\n== Carbon nano-tube reinforced polymer (CNRP) ==\nIn 2009, Zyvex Technologies introduced carbon nanotube-reinforced epoxy and carbon [[pre-preg]]s.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Zyvex Performance Materials Launch Line of Nano-Enhanced Adhesives that Add Strength, Cut Costs |url=http://www.zyvextech.com/www/dcms/files/data-sheets/epovex-adhesive-pr.pdf |publisher=Zyvex Performance Materials |date=9 October 2009 |accessdate=26 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016170430/http://www.zyvextech.com/www/dcms/files/data-sheets/epovex-adhesive-pr.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2012 }}</ref> [[Carbon nanotube]] reinforced polymer (CNRP) is several times stronger and tougher than CFRP and was used in the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II]] as a structural material for aircraft.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Trimble |first=Stephen |date=26 May 2011 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2011/05/26/357223/lockheed-martin-reveals-f-35-to-feature-nanocomposite.html |title=Lockheed Martin reveals F-35 to feature nanocomposite structures |journal=Flight International |accessdate=26 March 2015}}</ref> CNRP still uses carbon fiber as the primary reinforcement, but the binding matrix is a carbon nano-tube filled epoxy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zyvextech.com/www/dcms/files/data-sheets/arovex-msds.pdf |title=AROVEX\u2122 Nanotube Enhanced Epoxy Resin Carbon Fiber Prepreg \u2013 Material Safety Data Sheet |publisher=Zyvex Performance Materials |date=8 April 2009 |accessdate=26 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016170251/http://www.zyvextech.com/www/dcms/files/data-sheets/arovex-msds.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Carbon (fiber)]]\n*[[Carbon nanotube]]\n*[[Composite repairs]]\n*[[Fiber-reinforced plastic]]\n*[[The Mechanics of Running Blades]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Carbon fiber reinforced plastic}}\n*[http://www.carbonfiber.gr.jp/english/ Japan Carbon Fiber Manufacturers Association (English)]\n*[http://textilelearner.blogspot.com/2012/03/carbon-fiber-characteristicsproperties.html Article on the basis of Carbon Fiber]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070823130728/http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/story.php?relyear=2005&itemno=1074 Engineers design composite bracing system for injured Hokie running back Cedric Humes]\n*[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%202417.html The New Steel] a 1968 ''[[Flight International|Flight]]'' article on the announcement of carbon fiber\n*[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1971/1971%20-%201784.html Carbon Fibres \u2013 the First Five Years] A 1971 ''Flight'' article on carbon fiber in the aviation field\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Polymer}}\n[[Category:Composite materials]]\n[[Category:Aerospace materials]]\n[[Category:Synthetic fibers]]\n[[Category:Carbon forms]]"}]}}}}
