Aircraft demonstrated their potential as mobile observation platforms, then proved themselves to be machines of war capable of causing casualties to the enemy. The earliest known aerial victory with a synchronised machine gun-armed [[fighter aircraft]] occurred in 1915, by German [[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]] ''Leutnant'' [[Kurt Wintgens]]. [[Fighter aces]] appeared; the greatest (by number of air victories) was [[Manfred von Richthofen]].\n\nFollowing WWI, aircraft technology continued to develop. [[Alcock and Brown]] crossed the Atlantic non-stop for the first time in 1919. The first commercial flights took place between the United States and Canada in 1919.\n\n===World War II===\nAeroplanes had a presence in all the major battles of World War II. They were an essential component of the military strategies of the period, such as the German [[Blitzkrieg]] or the American and Japanese aircraft carrier campaigns of the Pacific.\n\n[[Military glider]]s were developed and used in several campaigns, but they did not become widely used due to the high casualty rate often encountered. The [[Focke-Achgelis Fa 330]] ''Bachstelze'' (Wagtail) rotor kite of 1942 was notable for its use by German submarines.\n\nBefore and during the war, both British and German designers were developing [[jet engine]]s to power aeroplanes. The first jet aircraft to fly, in 1939, was the German [[Heinkel He 178]]. In 1943 the first operational jet fighter, the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]], went into service with the German [[Luftwaffe]] and later in the war the British [[Gloster Meteor]] entered service but never saw action \u2014 top airspeeds of aircraft for that era went as high as 1,130&nbsp;km/h (702&nbsp;mph), with the early July 1944 unofficial record flight of the German [[Messerschmitt Me 163#Later versions|Me 163B V18]] rocket fighter prototype.<ref>de Bie, Rob.

New aircraft types, such as the [[B-52]], were produced during the Cold War.\n\nThe first [[jet airliner]], the [[de Havilland Comet]], was introduced in 1952, followed by the Soviet [[Tupolev Tu-104]] in 1956. The [[Boeing 707]], the first widely successful commercial jet, was in commercial service for more than 50 years, from 1958 to 2010. The [[Boeing 747]] was the world's biggest passenger aircraft from 1970 until it was surpassed by the [[Airbus A380]] in 2005.\n\n==Classes of fixed-wing aircraft==\n\n===Airplane/aeroplane===\n{{Main article|Airplane}}\nAn '''aeroplane''' (also known as an '''airplane''' or simply a '''plane''') is a powered fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by [[thrust]] from a [[jet engine]] or [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]. Planes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for planes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research.\n\n====Seaplane====\n{{Main article|Seaplane}}\nA '''seaplane''' is a fixed-wing aircraft capable of [[takeoff|taking off]] and [[water landing|landing]] (alighting) on water. Seaplanes that can also operate from dry land are a subclass called [[amphibian aircraft]]. These aircraft were sometimes called '''hydroplanes'''.<ref>de Saint-Exupery, A. (1940).  \"Wind, Sand and Stars\" p33, Harcourt, Brace & World, Inc.</ref> Seaplanes and amphibians are usually divided into two categories based on their technological characteristics: [[floatplane]]s and [[flying boat]]s.\n\n* A '''[[floatplane]]''' is similar in overall design to a land-based aeroplane, with a generally unmodified fuselage from as compared to its landplane version, except that the wheels at the base of the undercarriage are replaced by [[Float (nautical)|floats]], allowing the craft to operate from water rather than from dry land.\n* A '''[[flying boat]]''' is a [[seaplane]] with a watertight [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] forming the lower (ventral) areas of its fuselage, resting directly on the water's surface. It differs from a [[float plane]] as it does not need additional floats for buoyancy, although it may have small underwing floats or fuselage-mount [[sponson]]s to stabilize it on the water. Large seaplanes are usually flying boats, with most classic amphibian aircraft designs using some form of flying-boat design for their fuselage/hull.\n\n====Powered gliders====\nMany forms of glider (see below) may be modified by adding a small power plant. These include:\n*[[Motor glider]] - a conventional [[glider aircraft|glider]] or [[sailplane]] with an auxiliary power plant that may be used when in flight to increase performance.\n*[[Powered hang glider]] - a [[hang glider]] with a power plant added.\n*[[Powered parachute]] - a [[paraglider]] type of parachute with an integrated airframe, seat, undercarriage and power plant hung beneath.\n*[[Powered paraglider]] or paramotor - a [[paraglider]] with a power plant suspended behind the pilot.\n\n====Ground effect vehicle====\n{{main article|Ground effect vehicle}}\nA '''ground effect vehicle''' (GEV) is a craft that attains level flight near the surface of the earth, making use of the [[Ground effect (aerodynamics)|ground effect]] \u2013 an aerodynamic interaction between the wings and the earth's surface. Some GEVs are able to fly higher out of ground effect (OGE) when required \u2013 these are classed as powered fixed-wing aircraft.<ref>Michael Halloran and Sean O'Meara, ''Wing in Ground Effect Craft Review'', DSTO, Australia [http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/publications/2058/DSTO-GD-0201.pdf], p51.

A '''sailplane''' is a fixed-wing glider designed for soaring - the ability to gain height in updrafts of air and to fly for long periods.\n\nGliders are mainly used for recreation, but have also been used for other purposes such as aerodynamics research, warfare and recovering spacecraft.\n\nA [[motor glider]] does have an engine for extending its performance and some have engines powerful enough to take off, but the engine is not used in normal flight.\n\nAs is the case with planes, there are a wide variety of glider types differing in the construction of their wings, aerodynamic efficiency, location of the pilot and controls. Perhaps the most familiar type is the toy [[paper plane]].\n\nLarge gliders are most commonly launched by a tow-plane or by a winch.  [[Military glider]]s have been used in war to deliver assault troops, and specialised gliders have been used in atmospheric and [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] research. [[Rocket-powered aircraft]] and [[spaceplane]]s have also made unpowered landings.\n\nGliders and sailplanes that are used for the sport of [[gliding]] have high aerodynamic efficiency. The highest [[lift-to-drag ratio]] is 70:1, though 50:1 is more common. After launch, further energy is obtained through the skillful exploitation of rising air in the atmosphere. Flights of thousands of kilometres at average speeds over 200&nbsp;km/h have been achieved.\n\nThe most numerous unpowered aircraft are [[paper aeroplane]]s, a handmade type of glider. Like hang gliders and paragliders, they are foot-launched and are in general slower, smaller, and less expensive than sailplanes. Hang gliders most often have flexible wings given shape by a frame, though some have rigid wings. Paragliders and paper aeroplanes have no frames in their wings.\n\nGliders and sailplanes can share a number of features in common with powered aircraft, including many of the same types of fuselage and wing structures. For example, the [[Horten H.IV]] was a tailless flying wing glider, and the delta wing-shaped [[Space Shuttle]] orbiter flew much like a conventional glider in the lower atmosphere. Many gliders also use similar controls and instruments as powered craft.\n\n====Types of glider====\n[[File:Glider2010-overgunma.ogv|thumb|325px|(video) A glider sails over [[Gunma prefecture|Gunma]], [[Japan]].]] \nThe main application today of glider aircraft is sport and recreation.\n\n=====Sailplane=====\n{{Main article|Glider (sailplane)}}\n\nGliders were developed from the 1920s for recreational purposes. As pilots began to understand how to use rising air, [[sailplane]] gliders were developed with a high [[lift-to-drag ratio]].  These allowed longer glides to the next source of '[[lift (soaring)|lift]]', and so increase their chances of flying long distances. This gave rise to the popular sport of [[gliding]].\n\nEarly gliders were mainly built of wood and metal but the majority of sailplanes now use composite materials incorporating glass, carbon or [[aramid]] fibres. To minimise [[drag (force)|drag]], these types have a streamlined [[fuselage]] and long narrow wings having a [[Wing configuration#Aspect ratio|high aspect ratio]]. Both single-seat and two-seat gliders are available.\n\nInitially training was done by short 'hops' in [[primary glider]]s which are very basic aircraft with no [[Cockpit (aviation)|cockpit]] and minimal instruments.<ref name=\"Schweizer\">Schweizer, Paul A: ''Wings Like Eagles, The Story of Soaring in the United States'', pages 14-22. Smithsonian Institution Press, 1988. ISBN 0-87474-828-3</ref>  Since shortly after [[World War II]] training has always been done in two-seat dual control gliders, but  high performance two-seaters are also used to share the workload and the enjoyment of long flights. Originally skids were used for landing, but the majority now land on wheels, often retractable. Some gliders, known as [[motor glider]]s, are designed for unpowered flight, but can deploy [[piston engine|piston]], [[rotary engine|rotary]], [[jet engine|jet]] or [[electric motor|electric engines]].<ref name=\"definition\">[http://www.fai.org/gliding/sc3.1.0 Definition of gliders used for sporting purposes in FAI Sporting Code] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903034839/http://www.fai.org/gliding/sc3.1.0 |date=3 September 2009 }}</ref> Gliders are classified by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale|FAI]] for competitions into [[Glider Competition Classes|glider competition classes]] mainly on the basis of span and flaps.\n\n[[Image:Goatglider.jpg|thumb|right|Ultralight \"airchair\" Goat 1 glider]] A class of ultralight sailplanes, including some known as [[microlift glider]]s and some as 'airchairs', has been defined by the FAI based on a maximum weight. They are light enough to be transported easily, and can be flown without licensing in some countries. Ultralight gliders have performance similar to [[hang gliding|hang gliders]], but offer some additional crash safety as the pilot can be strapped in an upright seat within a deformable structure. Landing is usually on one or two wheels which distinguishes these craft from hang gliders. Several commercial ultralight gliders have come and gone, but most current development is done by individual designers and home builders.\n\n=====Military gliders=====\n[[Image:Waco CG-4A USAF.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Waco CG-4]]A of the USAAF in 1943]]\n[[Military gliders]] were used during [[World War II]] for carrying troops ([[glider infantry]]) and heavy equipment to combat zones. The gliders were towed into the air and most of the way to their target by military transport planes, e.g. [[C-47 Dakota]], or by bombers that had been relegated to secondary activities, e.g. [[Short Stirling]]. Once released from the tow near the target, they landed as close to the target as possible. The advantage over paratroopers were that heavy equipment could be landed and that the troops were quickly assembled rather than being dispersed over a drop zone. The gliders were treated as disposable, leading to construction from common and inexpensive materials such as wood, though a few were retrieved and re-used. By the time of the [[Korean War]], transport aircraft had also become larger and more efficient so that even light tanks could be dropped by parachute, causing gliders to fall out of favor.\n\n=====Research gliders=====\nEven after the development of powered aircraft, gliders continued to be used for [[aviation research]]. The [[NASA Paresev|NASA Paresev Rogallo flexible wing]] was originally developed to investigate alternative methods of recovering spacecraft. Although this application was abandoned, publicity inspired hobbyists to adapt the flexible-wing airfoil for modern hang gliders.\n\nInitial research into many types of fixed-wing craft, including [[flying wing]]s and [[lifting body|lifting bodies]] was also carried out using unpowered prototypes.\n\n=====Hang glider=====\n[[Image:Hang gliding hyner.jpg|thumb|Hang gliding]]\nA [[hang glider]] is a [[glider aircraft]] in which the pilot is ensconced in a harness suspended from the [[airframe]], and exercises control by shifting body weight in opposition to a control frame. Most modern hang gliders are made of an [[aluminium alloy]] or [[Composite material|composite]]-framed fabric wing. Pilots have the ability to [[Lift (soaring)|soar]] for hours, gain thousands of metres of altitude in [[thermal]] updrafts, perform aerobatics, and glide cross-country for hundreds of kilometres.\n\n=====Paraglider=====\nA [[paraglider]] is a lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Whittall|first=Noel|title=Paragliding: The Complete Guide|year=2002|publisher=Airlife Pub|isbn=1-84037-016-5|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Paragliding is most often a recreational activity.\n\n====Unmanned gliders====\nA [[paper airplane|paper plane]] is a toy aircraft (usually a glider) made out of paper or paperboard.\n\n[[Model glider|Model glider aircraft]] are models of aircraft using lightweight materials such as [[polystyrene]] and [[balsa wood]]. Designs range from simple glider aircraft to accurate [[scale model]]s, some of which can be very large.\n\n[[Glide bomb]]s are bombs with aerodynamic surfaces to allow a gliding flightpath rather than a ballistic one. This enables the carrying aircraft to attack a heavily defended target from a distance.\n\n===Kite===\n[[File:Chinese Kite.jpg|thumb|A [[kite]] in flight]]\n{{main article|Kite}}\nA '''kite''' is an aircraft tethered to a fixed point so that the wind blows over its wings.<ref>[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/guided.htm '&#39;Beginner's Guide to Aeronautics'&#39;], [[NASA]] (11 July 2008).</ref> [[Lift (force)|Lift]] is generated when air flows over the kite's wing, producing low pressure above the wing and high pressure below it, and deflecting the airflow downwards. This deflection also generates horizontal [[Drag (physics)|drag]] in the direction of the wind. The resultant force vector from the lift and drag force components is opposed by the tension of the one or more rope lines or [[tether]]s attached to the wing.\n\nKites are mostly flown for recreational purposes, but have many other uses. Early pioneers such as the [[Wright Brothers]] and [[J.W. Dunne]] sometimes flew an aircraft as a kite in order to develop it and confirm its flight characteristics, before adding an engine and flight controls, and flying it as an aeroplane.\n\n{{See also|Rotor kite}}\n{{clear}}\n\n====Uses====\n[[Image:Chinese dragon kite (Berkeley, California - 2000).jpg|thumb|Chinese dragon kite more than one hundred feet long which flew in the [[Berkeley, California]], kite festival in 2000]]\n\n=====Military applications=====\nKites have been used for signaling, for delivery of [[munition]]s, and for [[observation]], by lifting an observer above the field of battle, and by using [[kite aerial photography]].\n\n=====Science and meteorology=====\nKites have been used for scientific purposes, such as [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s famous experiment proving that [[lightning]] is [[electricity]]. Kites were the precursors to the traditional [[aircraft]], and were instrumental in the development of early flying craft. [[Alexander Graham Bell]] experimented with very large [[man-lifting kite]]s, as did the [[Wright brothers]] and [[Lawrence Hargrave]]. Kites had a historical role in lifting scientific instruments to measure atmospheric conditions for [[weather forecasting]].\n\n=====Radio aerials and light beacons=====\nKites can be used to carry radio antennas. This method was used for the reception station of the first transatlantic transmission by [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]]. [[moored balloon|Captive balloons]] may be more convenient for such experiments, because kite-carried antennas require a lot of wind, which may be not always possible with heavy equipment and a ground conductor.\n\nKites can be used to carry light effects such as lightsticks or battery powered lights.\n\n=====Kite traction=====\n[[Image:Kite333.JPG|thumb|right|A quad-line traction kite, commonly used as a power source for [[kite surfing]] ]]\n\nKites can be used to pull people and vehicles downwind. Efficient [[Foil kite|foil-type kites]] such as [[power kite]]s can also be used to sail upwind under the same principles as used by other sailing craft, provided that lateral forces on the ground or in the water are redirected as with the keels, center boards, wheels and ice blades of traditional sailing craft. In the last two decades several kite sailing sports have become popular, such as kite buggying, kite landboarding, [[kiteboating|kite boating]] and kite surfing. Snow kiting has also become popular.\n\nKite sailing opens several possibilities not available in traditional sailing:\n\n* Wind speeds are greater at higher altitudes\n* Kites may be manoeuvered dynamically which increases the force available dramatically\n* There is no need for mechanical structures to withstand bending forces; vehicles or hulls can be very light or dispensed with all together\n\n=====Power generation=====\n{{see also|laddermill|High altitude wind power}}\nConceptual research and development projects by over a hundred entities are investigating the use of kites in harnessing high altitude wind currents to generate electricity.<ref>{{cite web|author=Joseph Faust |url=http://energykitesystems.net/index.html |title=Kite Energy Systems |publisher=Energykitesystems.net |date= |accessdate=2012-10-03}}</ref>\n\n===== Cultural uses =====\nKite festivals are a popular form of entertainment throughout the world.

The parts present can vary according to the aircraft's type and purpose. Early types were usually made of wood with fabric wing surfaces, When engines became available for powered flight around a hundred years ago, their mounts were made of metal. Then as speeds increased more and more parts became metal until by the end of WWII all-metal aircraft were common. In modern times, increasing use of [[composite material]]s has been made.\n\nTypical structural parts include:\n\n* One or more large horizontal ''wings'', often with an [[airfoil]] cross-section shape. The wing deflects air downward as the aircraft moves forward, generating [[Lift (force)|lifting force]] to support it in flight. The wing also provides stability in [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)|roll]] to stop the aircraft from rolling to the left or right in steady flight.\n\n[[Image:Antonov 225 (2010).jpg|thumb|right|The [[An-225 Mriya]], which can carry a 250-tonne payload, has two vertical stabilisers.]]\n\n* A ''[[fuselage]]'', a long, thin body, usually with tapered or rounded ends to make its shape [[aerodynamically]] smooth. The fuselage joins the other parts of the airframe and usually contains important things such as the pilot, payload and flight systems.\n* A ''[[vertical stabiliser]]'' or fin is a vertical wing-like surface mounted at the rear of the plane and typically protruding above it. The fin stabilises the plane's [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)|yaw]] (turn left or right) and mounts the [[rudder]] which controls its rotation along that axis.\n* A ''[[horizontal stabiliser]]'', usually mounted at the tail near the vertical stabilizer. The horizontal stabilizer is used to stabilise the plane's [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)|pitch]] (tilt up or down) and mounts the [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevators]] which provide pitch control.\n* ''[[Landing gear]],'' a set of wheels, skids, or floats that support the plane while it is on the surface. On seaplanes the bottom of the fuselage or floats (pontoons) support it while on the water. On some planes the landing gear retracts during flight to reduce drag.\n\n===Wings===\nThe wings of a fixed-wing aircraft are static planes extending either side of the aircraft. When the aircraft travels forwards, \nair flows over the wings which are shaped to create lift.\n\n====Wing structure====\nKites and some light weight gliders and aeroplanes have flexible wing surfaces which are stretched across a frame and made rigid by the lift forces exerted by the airflow over them. Larger aircraft have rigid wing surfaces which provide additional strength.\n\nWhether flexible or rigid, most wings have a strong frame to give them their shape and to transfer lift from the wing surface to the rest of the aircraft. The main structural elements are one or more spars running from root to tip, and many ribs running from the leading (front) to the trailing (rear) edge.\n\nEarly aeroplane engines had little power and light weight was very important. Also, early aerofoil sections were very thin, and could not have strong frame installed within. So until the 1930s most wings were too light weight to have enough strength and external bracing struts and wires were added. When the available engine power increased during the 1920s and 1930s, wings could be made heavy and strong enough that bracing was not needed any more. This type of unbraced wing is called a cantilever wing.\n\n====Wing configuration====\n{{main article|Wing configuration|Wing}}\n[[File:Morane-Saulnier Type L - Captured with german insigna.jpg|thumb|Captured [[Morane-Saulnier L]] wire-braced parasol monoplane]]\nThe number and shape of the wings varies widely on different types. A given wing plane may be full-span or divided by a central [[fuselage]] into port (left) and starboard (right) wings. Occasionally even more wings have been used, with the three-winged [[triplane]] achieving some fame in WWI. The four-winged [[quadruplane]] and other [[Multiplane (aeronautics)]] designs have had little success.\n\nA [[monoplane]] has a single wing plane, a [[biplane]] has two stacked one above the other, a [[tandem wing]] has two placed one behind the other. When the available engine power increased during the 1920s and 1930s and bracing was no longer needed, the unbraced or cantilever monoplane became the most common form of powered type.\n\nThe wing [[planform (aeronautics)|planform]] is the shape when seen from above. To be aerodynamically efficient, a wing should be straight with a long span from side to side but have a short chord (high [[aspect ratio]]). But to be structurally efficient, and hence light weight, a wing must have a short span but still enough area to provide lift (low aspect ratio).\n\nAt transonic speeds, near the [[speed of sound]], it helps to sweep the wing backwards or forwards to reduce drag from supersonic shock waves as they begin to form. The [[swept wing]] is just a straight wing swept backwards or forwards.\n\n[[Image:Dassault Mirage G8.jpg|thumb|Two [[Dassault Mirage G]] prototypes, one with wings swept]]\n\nThe [[delta wing]] is a triangle shape which may be used for a number of reasons. As a flexible [[Rogallo wing]] it allows a stable shape under aerodynamic forces, and so is often used for kites and other ultralight  craft. As a supersonic wing it combines high strength with low drag and so is often used for fast jets.\n\nA variable geometry wing can be changed in flight to a different shape. The [[variable sweep wing|variable-sweep wing]] transforms between an efficient straight configuration for [[takeoff and landing]], to a low-drag swept configuration for high-speed flight. Other forms of variable planform have been flown, but none have gone beyond the research stage.\n\n===Fuselage===\n{{Main article|fuselage}}\nA ''[[fuselage]]'' is a long, thin body, usually with tapered or rounded ends to make its shape [[aerodynamically]] smooth. The fuselage may contain the [[flight crew]], passengers, cargo or [[payload (air and space craft)|payload]], fuel and engines. The pilots of manned aircraft operate them from a ''[[Cockpit (aviation)|cockpit]]'' located at the front or top of the fuselage and equipped with controls and usually windows and instruments. A plane may have more than one fuselage, or it may be fitted with booms with the tail located between the booms to allow the extreme rear of the fuselage to be useful for a variety of purposes.\n\n===Wings vs. bodies===\n\n====Flying wing====\n{{main article|Flying wing}}\n[[Image:USAF B-2 Spirit.jpg|thumb|right|The US-produced [[B-2 Spirit]], a [[strategic bomber]] using a flying wing configuration which is capable of intercontinental missions]]\nA flying wing is a [[tailless aircraft|tailless]] aircraft which has no definite [[fuselage]], with most of the crew, payload and equipment being housed inside the main wing structure.<ref name=\"Crane\">Crane, Dale: ''Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition''. Aviation Supplies & Academics, 1997. ISBN 1-56027-287-2</ref>{{rp|224}}\n\nThe flying wing configuration was studied extensively in the 1930s and 1940s, notably by [[Jack Northrop]] and [[Cheston L. Eshelman]] in the United States, and [[Alexander Lippisch]] and the [[Horten brothers]] in Germany.\nAfter the war, a number of experimental designs were based on the flying wing concept. Some general interest continued until the early 1950s but designs did not necessarily offer a great advantage in range and presented a number of technical problems, leading to the adoption of \"conventional\" solutions like the [[Convair B-36]] and the [[B-52 Stratofortress]]. Due to the practical need for a deep wing, the flying wing concept is most practical for designs in the slow-to-medium speed range, and there has been continual interest in using it as a tactical [[airlift]]er design.\n\nInterest in flying wings was renewed in the 1980s due to their potentially low [[radar]] reflection cross-sections. [[Stealth technology]] relies on shapes which only reflect radar waves in certain directions, thus making the aircraft hard to detect unless the radar receiver is at a specific position relative to the aircraft - a position that changes continuously as the aircraft moves. This approach eventually led to the Northrop [[B-2 Spirit]] [[Stealth aircraft|stealth]] bomber. In this case the aerodynamic advantages of the flying wing are not the primary needs. However, modern computer-controlled [[fly-by-wire]] systems allowed for many of the aerodynamic drawbacks of the flying wing to be minimised, making for an efficient and stable long-range bomber.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Blended wing body====\n{{main article|Blended wing}}\n[[Image:NASA BWB.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Computer-generated model of the [[Boeing X-48]]]]\nBlended wing body aircraft have a flattened and airfoil shaped body, which produces most of the lift to keep itself aloft, and distinct and separate wing structures, though the wings are smoothly blended in with the body.\n\nThus blended wing bodied aircraft incorporate design features from both a futuristic fuselage and flying wing design. The purported advantages of the blended wing body approach are efficient high-lift wings and a wide [[airfoil]]-shaped body. This enables the entire craft to contribute to [[lift (force)|lift]] generation with the result of potentially increased fuel economy.\n\n====Lifting body====\n[[Image:X24.jpg|thumb|right|The Martin Aircraft Company [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24]] was built as part of a 1963 to 1975 experimental US military program.]]\n{{main article|Lifting body}}\nA lifting body is a configuration in which the body itself produces [[lift (force)|lift]]. In contrast to a [[flying wing]], which is a wing with minimal or no conventional [[fuselage]], a lifting body can be thought of as a fuselage with little or no conventional wing. Whereas a flying wing seeks to maximize cruise efficiency at [[Subsonic flight|subsonic]] speeds by eliminating non-lifting surfaces, lifting bodies generally minimize the drag and structure of a wing for subsonic, [[supersonic]], and [[hypersonic]] flight, or, [[spacecraft]] [[re-entry]]. All of these flight regimes pose challenges for proper flight stability.\n\nLifting bodies were a major area of research in the 1960s and 1970s as a means to build a small and lightweight manned spacecraft. The US built a number of famous lifting body rocket planes to test the concept, as well as several rocket-launched re-entry vehicles that were tested over the Pacific. Interest waned as the [[US Air Force]] lost interest in the manned mission, and major development ended during the [[Space Shuttle design process]] when it became clear that the highly shaped fuselages made it difficult to fit fuel tankage.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Empennage and foreplane===\n{{main article|Empennage|Canard (aeronautics)}}\nThe classic aerofoil section wing is unstable in flight and difficult to control. Flexible-wing types often rely on an anchor line or the weight of a pilot hanging beneath to maintain the correct attitude. Some free-flying types use an adapted aerofoil that is stable, or other ingenious mechanisms including, most recently, electronic artificial stability.\n\nBut in order to achieve trim, stability and control, most fixed-wing types have an [[empennage]] comprising a fin and rudder which act horizontally and a tailplane and elevator which act vertically. This is so common that it is known as the conventional layout. Sometimes there may be two or more fins, spaced out along the tailplane.\n\n[[File:SaabViggen Canards.jpg|thumb|Canards on the [[Saab Viggen]]]]\nSome types have a horizontal \"[[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]]\" foreplane ahead of the main wing, instead of behind it.<ref name=\"Crane\" />{{rp|86}}<ref name=\"GroundUp\">Aviation Publishers Co.

Typically each wire acts as a tether to the part of the kite it is attached to.\n\n====Free-flying aircraft controls====\nGliders and aeroplanes have more complex control systems, especially if they are piloted.\n\n{{Main article|Aircraft flight control system}}\n[[File:Pilotska kabina zrakoplova.JPG|thumb|Typical light aircraft ([[Cessna 150]]M) cockpit with control yokes]]\nThe main controls allow the pilot to direct the aircraft in the air. Typically these are:\n*The ''[[yoke (aircraft)|yoke]]'' or ''[[joystick]]'' controls rotation of the plane about the pitch and roll axes. A [[yoke (aircraft)|yoke]] resembles a steering wheel, and a control stick is a joystick. The pilot can pitch the plane down by pushing on the yoke or stick, and pitch the plane up by pulling on it. Rolling the plane is accomplished by turning the yoke in the direction of the desired roll, or by tilting the control stick in that direction.\n*''[[Rudder]] pedals'' control rotation of the plane about the yaw axis. There are two pedals that pivot so that when one is pressed forward the other moves backward, and vice versa. The pilot presses on the right rudder pedal to make the plane yaw to the right, and pushes on the left pedal to make it yaw to the left. The rudder is used mainly to balance the plane in turns, or to compensate for winds or other effects that tend to turn the plane about the yaw axis.\n*On powered types, an engine stop control (\"fuel cutoff\", for example) and, usually, a ''[[Throttle]]'' or ''[[thrust lever]]'' and other controls, such as a fuel-mixture control (to compensate for air density changes with altitude change).\n\nOther common controls include:\n*''[[Flap (aircraft)|Flap]] levers,'' which are used to control the deflection position of flaps on the wings.\n*''[[Spoiler (aeronautics)|Spoiler]] levers,'' which are used to control the position of spoilers on the wings, and to arm their automatic deployment in planes designed to deploy them upon landing. The spoilers reduce lift for landing.\n*''[[Trim tab|Trim]] controls,'' which usually take the form of knobs or wheels and are used to adjust pitch, roll, or yaw trim. These are often connected to small airfoils on the trail edge of the control surfaces called 'trim tabs'. Trim is used to reduce the amount of pressure on the control forces needed to maintain a steady course.\n*On wheeled types, ''[[Brake]]s'' are used to slow and stop the plane on the ground, and sometimes for turns on the ground.\n\nA craft may have two pilots' seats with dual controls, allowing two pilots to take turns. This is often used for training or for longer flights.\n\nThe control system may allow full or partial automation of flight, such as an [[autopilot]], a wing leveler, or a [[flight management system]]. An [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|unmanned aircraft]] has no pilot but is controlled remotely or via means such as gyroscopes or other forms of autonomous control.\n\n===Cockpit instrumentation===\n[[File:Six flight instruments.JPG|thumb|Six basic flight instruments]]\nOn manned types, instruments provide information to the pilots, including [[Flight instruments|flight]], [[Aircraft engine|engines]], navigation, communications and other aircraft systems that may be installed.\n\nThe six basic instruments (sometimes referred to as the six pack) include:<ref name=6pack>{{cite web|title=Six Pack - The Primary Flight Instruments|url=http://www.learntofly.ca/six-pack-primary-flight-instruments/|publisher=LearnToFly.ca|accessdate=31 January 2011}}</ref>\n* An ''[[airspeed indicator]],'' which indicates the speed at which the plane is moving through the surrounding air.\n* An ''[[altimeter]],'' which indicates the altitude or height of the plane above mean sea level.\n* A ''[[heading indicator]],'' (sometimes referred to as a \"directional gyro (DG)\"), which indicates the magnetic compass heading that the plane's fuselage is pointing towards. The actual direction the plane is flying towards is affected by the wind conditions.\n* An ''[[attitude indicator]],'' sometimes called an ''artificial horizon,'' which indicates the exact orientation of the plane about its pitch and roll axes.\n* A ''[[vertical speed indicator]],'' which shows the rate at which the plane is climbing or descending.\n* A ''[[turn coordinator]],'' or ''turn and bank indicator'' which helps the pilot maintain the plane in a coordinated attitude while turning.\n\nOther instruments might include:\n* A ''[[two-way radio]]'' to enable communications with other planes and [[air traffic control]]. Planes built before [[World War II]] may not have been equipped with a radio but they are nearly essential now.\n* A ''[[horizontal situation indicator]],'' shows the position and movement of the plane as seen from above with respect to the ground, including course/heading and other information.\n* Instruments showing the status of each engine in the plane (operating speed, thrust, temperature, RPM, and other variables).\n* Combined display systems such as ''[[primary flight display]]s'' or ''navigation displays.''\n* Information displays such as on-board ''[[weather radar]]'' displays.\n* A ''[[radio direction finder]]'' which indicates the direction to one or more radio beacons and which can be used to determine the plane's position.\n* A ''[[satellite navigation]]'' system to provide an accurate position.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Aviation}}\n* [[Aircraft flight mechanics]]\n* [[Airliner]]\n* [[Aviation]]\n* [[Aviation and the environment]]\n* [[Aviation history]]\n* [[Fuel efficiency]]\n* [[List of altitude records reached by different aircraft types]]\n* [[Maneuvering speed]]\n* [[Rotorcraft]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n* In 1903, when the Wright brothers used the word \"aeroplane,\" it meant wing, not the whole aircraft.
