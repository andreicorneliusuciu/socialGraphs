For example, [[bookkeeping]] involves functions such as posting transactions and producing reports like the [[balance sheet]] and the [[cash flow statement]].  Completely manual methods were augmented by the application of [[mechanical calculator|mechanical]] or electronic [[calculator]]s.  A person whose job was to perform calculations manually or using a calculator was called a \"[[Human computer|computer]].\"\n\nThe [[1850 United States Census]] schedule was the first to gather data by individual rather than [[household]].  A number of questions could be answered by making a check in the appropriate box on the form. From 1850 through 1880 the Census Bureau employed \"a system of tallying, which, by reason of the increasing number of combinations of classifications required, became increasingly complex. Only a limited number of combinations could be recorded in one tally, so it was necessary to handle the schedules 5 or 6 times, for as many independent tallies.\"<ref name=Truesdell65>{{cite book|last=Truesdell|first=Leon E.|title=The development of punch card tabulation in the Bureau of the Census, 1890|year=1965|publisher=United States Department of Commerce|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=MGZqAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&authuser=0&hl=en&pg=GBS.PR1}}</ref>  \"It took over 7 years to publish the results of the 1880 census\"<ref name=Bohme91>{{cite book|last1=Bohme|first1=Frederick|last2=Wyatt|first2=J.

It is also estimated that using Herman Hollerith's system saved some $5 million in processing costs\"<ref name=Bohme91 /> (in 1890 dollars) even with twice as many questions as during 1880.\n\n===Electronic data processing===\nComputerized data processing, or [[Electronic data processing]] represents a later development, with a computer used instead of several independent pieces of equipment.  The Census Bureau first made limited use of [[electronic computers]] for the [[1950 United States Census]], using a [[UNIVAC I]] system,<ref name=Truesdell65 /> delivered during 1952.\n\n===Other developments===\nThe term ''data processing'' has mostly been subsumed by the newer and somewhat more general term ''[[information technology]]'' (IT).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}  The term \"data processing\" is presently considered sometimes to have a negative connotation, suggesting use of older technologies.   As an example, during 1996 the ''[[Data Processing Management Association]]'' (DPMA) changed its name to the ''Association of Information Technology Professionals''. Nevertheless, the terms are approximately synonymous.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Commercial data processing===\n{{main article|Electronic data processing}}\nCommercial data processing involves a large volume of input data, relatively few computational operations, and a large volume of output. For example, an insurance company needs to keep records on tens or hundreds of thousands of policies, print and mail bills, and receive and post payments.\n\n===Data analysis===\n{{main article|Data analysis}}\nFor science or engineering, the terms ''data processing'' and ''information systems'' are considered too broad, and the more specialized term [[data analysis]] is typically used. \nData analysis uses specialized and precise [[algorithm]]s and statistical calculations that are less often observed in a typical general business environment. For data analysis, software like [[SPSS]] or [[SAS (software)|SAS]], or their free counterparts such as [[DAP (software)|DAP]], [[gretl]] or [[PSPP]] are often used.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Data processing system]]\n*[[Big data]]\n*[[Computation]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Bourque, Linda B.; Clark, Virginia A.
