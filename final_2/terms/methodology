It comprises the theoretical analysis of the body of methods and principles associated with a branch of knowledge.  Typically, it encompasses concepts such as [[paradigm]], theoretical model, phases and quantitative or qualitative techniques.<ref>Irny, S.I. and Rose, A.A. (2005) \u201cDesigning a Strategic Information Systems Planning Methodology for Malaysian Institutes of Higher Learning (isp- ipta), Issues in Information System, Volume VI, No. 1, 2005.</ref>\n\nA methodology does not set out to provide solutions - it is, therefore, not the same as a method.  Instead, a methodology offers the theoretical underpinning for understanding which method, set of methods, or [[Best practice|best practices]] can be applied to specific case, for example, to calculate a specific result.\n\nIt has been defined also as follows:\n\n# \"the [[analysis]] of the principles of methods, rules, and postulates employed by a discipline\";<ref name=\"merrian-webster\" />\n# \"the systematic study of methods that are, can be, or have been applied within a discipline\";<ref name=\"merrian-webster\">[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/methodology Methodology Usage Notes], entry at [[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam\u2013Webster]]</ref>\n# \"the study or description of methods\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Baskerville|first1=R. |last2= |first2= |year= 1991|title= Risk Analysis as a Source of Professional Knowledge|journal=Computers & Security |volume= 10|issue=8 |pages=749\u2013764 }}</ref>\n\n==Relationship between methodology, theory, paradigm, algorithm and method==\nThe ''methodology'' is the general research strategy that outlines the way in which research is to be undertaken and, among other things, identifies the methods to be used in it. These ''methods'', described in the methodology, define the means or modes of data collection or, sometimes, how a specific result is to be calculated.<ref>Howell, K. E. (2013) Introduction to the Philosophy of Methodology. London: Sage Publications</ref>  ''Methodology'' does not define specific methods, even though much attention is given to the nature and kinds of processes to be followed in a particular procedure or to attain an objective.\n\nWhen proper to a study of methodology, such processes constitute a ''constructive generic framework'', and may therefore be broken down into sub-processes, combined, or their sequence changed.<ref name=Vacca1>{{cite book\n|last= Katsicas\n|first=Sokratis K.\n|editor1-last=Vacca\n|editor1-first=John\n|title=Computer and Information Security Handbook\n|series=Morgan Kaufmann Publications\n|year=2009\n|publisher= Elsevier Inc\n|isbn= 978-0-12-374354-1\n|page=605\n|chapter=Chapter 35}}\n</ref>\n\nA ''[[paradigm]]'' is similar to a methodology in that it is also a ''constructive framework''.  In theoretical work, the development of paradigms satisfies most or all of the criteria for methodology.<ref>See, for example, [[Thomas Kuhn]], ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (University of Chicago, 1970, 2nd ed.)</ref>  An ''[[algorithm]]'', like a paradigm, is also a type of ''constructive framework'', meaning that the construction is a logical, rather than a physical, array of connected elements.\n\nAny description of a means of calculation of a specific result is always a description of a method and never a description of a methodology.  It is thus important to avoid using ''methodology'' as a synonym for ''method'' or ''body of methods''.  Doing this shifts it away from its true [[Epistemology|epistemological]] meaning and reduces it to being the procedure itself, or the set of tools, or the instruments that should have been its outcome.  A methodology is the design process for carrying out research or the development of a procedure and is not in itself an instrument, or method, or procedure for doing things.\n\n''Methodology'' and ''method'' are not interchangeable. In recent years however, there has been a tendency to use ''methodology'' as a \"pretentious substitute for the word ''method''\".<ref name=\"TheFreeDictionary\"> [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/methodology misuse of the word Methodology in technical contexts]</ref>{{Failed verification|date=August 2015}} Using ''methodology'' as a synonym for ''method'' or ''set of methods'' leads to confusion and misinterpretation and undermines the proper analysis that should go into designing research.<ref name=\"TheFreeDictionary\" />{{Failed verification|date=August 2015}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Art methodology]]\n*[[Hermeneutics]]\n*[[Interdisciplinarity]]\n*[[Paradigm]]\n*[[Scientific method]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Berg, Bruce L., 2009, ''Qualitative Research Methods for the Social Sciences''.
