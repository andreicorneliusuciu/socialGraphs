In contemporary usage it includes: pictorial representation of data, as in computer-aided design and manufacture, in typesetting and the graphic arts, and in educational and recreational software. Images that are generated by a computer are called [[Computer graphics (computer science)|computer graphics]].\n\nExamples are [[photograph]]s, [[drawings]], [[Line art]], [[graph of a function|graphs]], [[diagram]]s, [[typography]], [[number]]s, [[symbol]]s, [[geometric]] designs, [[map]]s, [[engineering drawing]]s,\nor other [[image]]s. Graphics often combine [[character (computer)|text]], [[illustration]], and [[color]]. [[Graphic design]] may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flyer, poster, web site, or book without any other element. Clarity or effective communication may be the objective, association with other cultural elements may be sought, or merely, the creation of a distinctive style.\n\nGraphics can be functional or artistic. The latter can be a recorded version, such as a photograph, or an interpretation by a scientist to highlight essential features, or an artist, in which case the distinction with imaginary graphics may become blurred.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of graphic design}}\nThe earliest graphics known to anthropologists studying prehistoric periods are [[cave painting]]s and markings on boulders, bone, ivory, and antlers, which were created during the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] period from 40,000\u201310,000 [[Before Christ|B.C.]] or earlier. Many of these were found to record astronomical, seasonal, and chronological details. Some of the earliest graphics and drawings known to the [[modern world]], from almost 6,000 years ago, are that of engraved [[stone tablets]] and ceramic [[cylinder seal]]s, marking the beginning of the historic periods and the keeping of records for accounting and inventory purposes. Records from Egypt predate these and [[papyrus]] was used by the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] as a material on which to plan the building of [[pyramid]]s; they also used slabs of [[limestone]] and [[wood]]. From 600\u2013250&nbsp;BC, the Greeks played a major role in [[geometry]]. They used graphics to represent their mathematical theories such as the Circle Theorem and the [[Pythagorean theorem]].\n\nIn art, \"graphics\" is often used to distinguish work in a monotone and made up of lines, as opposed to [[painting]].\n\n=== Drawing ===\n{{Main|Drawing|Technical drawing}}\n[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - presumed self-portrait - WGA12798.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing]]\nDrawing generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. In which a tool is always used as if there were no tools it would be art. Graphical drawing is an instrumental guided drawing.\n\n=== Printmaking ===\n{{Main|Printmaking}}\n[[Woodblock printing]], including images is first seen in [[China]] after [[paper]] was invented (about A.D. 105).  In the West the main techniques have been [[woodcut]], [[engraving]] and [[etching]], but there are many others.\n\n==== Etching ====\n{{Main|Etching}}\nEtching is an [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] method of [[printmaking]] in which the image is incised into the surface of a metal plate using an acid. The acid eats the metal, leaving behind roughened areas, or, if the surface exposed to the acid is very thin, burning a line into the plate. The use of the process in printmaking is believed to have been invented by [[Daniel Hopfer]] (c. 1470\u20131536) of [[Augsburg]], [[Germany]], who decorated armour in this way.\n\nEtching is also used in the manufacturing of printed circuit boards and semiconductor devices.\n\n=== Line art ===\n{{Main|Line art}}\nLine art is a rather non-specific term sometimes used for any image that consists of distinct straight and curved lines placed against a (usually plain) background, without gradations in [[shading|shade]] (darkness) or [[hue]] ([[color]]) to represent two-dimensional or three-dimensional objects. Line art is usually monochromatic, although lines may be of different colors.\n\n=== Illustration ===\n{{Main|Illustration}}\n[[File:Mad scientist.svg|thumb|170px|An [[illustration]] of a character from a story; also, an illustration of illustrations]]\nAn illustration is a [[Visual system|visual]] [[Representation (arts)|representation]] such as a [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[photograph]] or other work of [[art]] that stresses subject more than form. The aim of an illustration is to elucidate or decorate a story, poem or piece of textual information (such as a [[newspaper]] article), traditionally by providing a visual representation of something described in the text. The [[editorial cartoon]], also known as a political cartoon, is an illustration containing a political or social message.\n\nIllustrations can be used to display a wide range of subject matter and serve a variety of functions, such as:\n* giving faces to characters in a story\n* displaying a number of examples of an item described in an academic textbook (e.g. A [[Typology (archaeology)|Typology]])\n* visualising step-wise sets of instructions in a technical manual\n* communicating subtle thematic tone in a narrative\n* linking brands to the ideas of human expression, individuality and creativity\n* making a reader laugh or smile\n* for fun (to make laugh) funny\n\n=== Graphs ===\nA graph or chart is a  [[information graphic]] that represents [[Table (information)|tabular]], [[number|numeric]] data. Charts are often used to make it easier to understand large quantities of data and the relationships between different parts of the data.\n\n=== Diagrams ===\n{{Main|Diagram}}\nA diagram is a simplified and structured visual representation of concepts, ideas, constructions, relations, statistical data, etc., used to visualize and clarify the topic.\n\n=== Symbols ===\n{{Main|Symbol}}\nA symbol, in its basic sense, is a  representation of a [[concept]] or quantity; i.e., an [[idea]], [[object (philosophy)|object]], concept, [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]], etc. In more psychological and philosophical terms, all concepts are symbolic in nature, and representations for these concepts are simply token artifacts that are [[allegorical]] to (but do not directly codify) a symbolic [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]], or [[symbol]]ism.\n\n=== Maps ===\n{{Main|Map}}\nA map is a simplified depiction of a [[space]], a navigational aid which highlights relations between objects within that space. Usually, a map is a [[2D geometric model|two-dimensional, geometrically accurate representation]] of a three-dimensional space.\n\nOne of the first 'modern' maps was made by [[Waldseem\u00fcller]].\n\n=== Photography ===\n{{Main|Photography}}\n[[File:Tulip01.jpg|thumb|Photo]]\nOne difference between photography and other forms of graphics is that a photographer, in principle, just records a single moment in reality, with seemingly no interpretation. However, a photographer can choose the [[field of view]] and angle, and may also use other techniques, such as various [[photographic lens|lenses]] to distort the view or [[filter (photography)|filters]] to change the colors. In recent times, [[digital photography]] has opened the way to an infinite number of fast, but strong, manipulations. Even in the early days of photography, there was controversy over photographs of enacted scenes that were presented as 'real life' (especially in [[war photography]], where it can be very difficult to record the original events). Shifting the viewer's eyes ever so slightly with simple pinpricks in the negative could have a dramatic effect.\n\nThe choice of the field of view can have a strong effect, effectively 'censoring out' other parts of the scene, accomplished by cropping them out or simply not including them in the photograph. This even touches on the philosophical question of what reality is. The human brain processes information based on previous experience, making us see what we want to see or what we were taught to see. Photography does the same, although the photographer interprets the scene for their viewer.\n\n=== Engineering drawings ===\n[[File:First angle projection.svg|thumb|Image of a part represented in First Angle Projection]]\n{{Main|Engineering drawing}}\nAn engineering drawing is a type of [[drawing]] and is technical in nature, used to fully and clearly define requirements for [[engineering|engineered]] items. It is usually created in accordance with standardized conventions for layout, nomenclature, interpretation, appearance (such as [[typeface]]s and line styles), size, etc.\n\n=== Computer graphics ===\n{{Main|Computer graphics}}\nThere are two types of computer graphics: [[raster graphics]], where each pixel is separately defined (as in a digital photograph), and [[vector graphics]], where mathematical formulas are used to draw lines and shapes, which are then interpreted at the viewer's end to produce the graphic. Using vectors results in infinitely sharp graphics and often smaller [[Computer file|files]], but, when complex,like vectors take time to render and may have larger file sizes than a raster equivalent.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Crysis MotionBlur.jpg|thumb|left|A screenshot from the 2007 video game ''[[Crysis]]'' displaying extremely photo-realistic real-time computer graphics]] -->\n\nIn 1950, the first computer-driven display was attached to MIT's [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind I]] computer to generate simple pictures. This was followed by [[MIT]]'s [[TX-0]] and [[TX-2]], interactive computing which increased interest in computer graphics during the late 1950s. In 1962, [[Ivan Sutherland]] invented [[Sketchpad]], an innovative program that influenced alternative forms of interaction with computers.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, large computer graphics research projects were begun at [[MIT]], [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], [[Bell Labs]], and [[Lockheed Corporation]]. [[Douglas T. Ross]] of [[MIT]] developed an advanced compiler language for graphics programming. [[Steven Anson Coons|S.A.Coons]], also at MIT, and J. C. Ferguson at [[Boeing]], began work in sculptured surfaces. [[General Motors Corporation|GM]] developed their [[DAC-1]] system, and other companies, such as [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], and [[McDonnell Aircraft|McDonnell]], also made significant developments. In 1968, [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] was first described by Arthur Appel of the IBM Research Center, Yorktown Heights, N.Y.<ref>Appel A. (1968). Some Techniques for Machine Rendering of Solids, AFIPS 1968 Spring Joint Computer Conference, Vol. 32, pp. 37-45</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1970s, [[personal computer]]s became more powerful, capable of drawing both basic and complex shapes and designs. In the 1980s, artists and graphic designers began to see the personal computer, particularly the [[Commodore Amiga]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], as a serious design tool, one that could save time and draw more accurately than other methods. [[3D computer graphics]] became possible in the late 1980s with the powerful [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] computers, which were later used to create some of the first fully computer-generated [[short film]]s at [[Pixar]]. The [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] remains one of the most popular tools for computer graphics in graphic design studios and businesses.\n\nModern computer systems, dating from the 1980s and onwards, often use a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) to present data and information with symbols, icons and pictures, rather than text. Graphics are one of the five key elements of [[multimedia]] technology.\n\n[[3D graphics]] became more popular in the 1990s in [[Video game|gaming]], [[multimedia]] and [[animation]]. In 1996, [[Quake (video game)|Quake]], one of the first fully 3D [[game]]s, was released. In 1995, [[Toy Story]], the first full-length computer-generated animation film, was released in cinemas. Since then, computer graphics have become more accurate and detailed, due to more advanced computers and better 3D modeling software applications, such as [[Maya (software)|Maya]], [[3D Studio Max]], and [[Cinema 4D]].\n<!-- Info on development of hand painting and drawing through history might be good here -->\n\nAnother use of computer graphics is [[screensaver]]s, originally intended to preventing the layout of much-used GUIs from 'burning into' the computer screen. They have since evolved into true pieces of art, their practical purpose obsolete; modern screens are not susceptible to such\nburn in artifacts.\n\n=== Web graphics ===\nIn the 1990s, Internet speeds increased, and Internet browsers capable of viewing images were released, the first being [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]]. Websites began to use the [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] format to display small graphics, such as banners, advertisements and navigation buttons, on web pages. Modern [[web browser]]s can now display [[JPEG]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] and increasingly, [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] images in addition to GIFs on web pages. SVG, and to some extent [[Vector Markup Language|VML]], support in some modern web browsers have made it possible to display [[vector graphics]] that are clear at any size. [[Plug-in (computing)|Plugins]] expand the web browser functions to display animated, interactive and 3-D graphics contained within file formats such as [[SWF]] and [[X3D]].\n\n[[File:Orangesig.jpg|left|thumb|Signature art used on web forums]]\nModern web graphics can be made with software such as [[Adobe Photoshop]], the [[GIMP]], or [[Corel Paint Shop Pro]]. Users of [[Microsoft Windows]] have [[Paint (software)|MS Paint]], which many find to be lacking in features. This is because [[Paint (software)|MS Paint]] is a drawing package and '''not''' a graphics package.\n\nNumerous platforms and websites have been created to cater to web graphics artists and to host their communities. A growing number of people use create internet forum signatures\u2014generally appearing after a user's post\u2014and other digital artwork, such as photo manipulations and large graphics. With computer games' developers creating their own communities around their products, many more websites are being developed to offer graphics for the fans and to enable them to show their appreciation of such games in their own gaming profiles.\n\n== Uses ==\nGraphics are [[visual]] elements often used to point readers and viewers to particular information. They are also used to supplement text in an effort to aid readers in their understanding of a particular concept or make the concept more clear or interesting. [[Popular culture|Popular]] [[magazine]]s, such as ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'', ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'', usually contain graphic material in abundance to attract readers, unlike the majority of [[Academic journal|scholarly journals]]. In computing, they are used to create a graphical [[User interface|interface]] for the user; and graphics are one of the five key elements of [[multimedia]] technology. Graphics are among the primary ways of advertising the sale of goods or services.\n\n=== Business ===\nGraphics are commonly used in [[business]] and [[economics]] to create [[financial chart]]s and tables. The term ''Business Graphics'' came into use in the late 1970s, when personal computers became capable of drawing graphs and charts instead of using a tabular format. Business Graphics can be used to highlight changes over a period of time.\n\n=== Advertising ===\nAdvertising is one of the most profitable uses of graphics; artists often do advertising work or take advertising potential into account when creating art, to increase the chances of selling the artwork.\nMost importantly, graphics gives a good look to artwork whenever it is applied. Graphics contribute to the general outlook of a designed artwork, this in turn lure interested members of the public to look at the work of art or purchasing it.\nAny graphical work (especially advertisement)or any work of art that is poorly design will not persuade the audience. therefore, for an advertisement to persuade and convince readers or viewers, it must be well designed with needed graphical tools so as to bring profit to the designer or advertiser.\n\n=== Political ===\nThe use of graphics for overtly political purposes\u2014cartoons, graffiti, poster art, flag design, etc.\u2014is a centuries-old practice which thrives today in every part of the world. The [[Northern Irish murals]] are one such example. A more recent example is [[Shepard Fairey]]'s 2008 U.S. Presidential election [[Barack Obama \"Hope\" poster]]. It was first published on the web, but soon found its way onto streets throughout the United States.<ref>Steven Heller and Seymour Chwast (2011). Graphic Style: From Victorian to New Century. Abrams.</ref>\n\n=== Education ===\nGraphics are heavily used in [[textbook]]s, especially those concerning subjects such as [[geography]], [[science]], and [[mathematics]], in order to illustrate theories and concepts, such as the [[human anatomy]]. Diagrams are also used to label photographs and pictures.\n\n[[Educational animation]] is an important emerging field of graphics. Animated graphics have obvious advantages over static graphics when explaining subject matter that changes over time.\n\nThe ''Oxford Illustrated Dictionary'' uses graphics and technical illustrations to make reading material more interesting and easier to understand. In an [[encyclopedia]], graphics are used to illustrate concepts and show examples of the particular topic being discussed.\n\nIn order for a graphic to function effectively as an educational aid, the learner must be able to interpret it successfully. This interpretative capacity is one aspect of [[graphicacy]].\n\n=== Film and animation ===\nComputer graphics are often used in the majority of new feature films, especially those with a large budget. Films that heavily use computer graphics include [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]], the [[Harry Potter]] films, [[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]] and [[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]].\n\n== Graphics education ==\nThe majority of schools, colleges and universities around the world educate students on the subject of graphics and art.\n\nThe subject is taught in a broad variety of ways, each course teaching its own distinctive balance of craft skills and intellectual response to the client's needs.\n\nSome graphics courses prioritize traditional craft skills\u2014drawing, printmaking and typography\u2014over modern craft skills. Other courses may place an emphasis on teaching digital craft skills. Still other courses may downplay the crafts entirely, concentrating on training students to generate novel intellectual responses that engage with the brief. Despite these apparent differences in training and curriculum, the staff and students on any of these courses will generally consider themselves to be graphic designers.\n\nThe typical [[pedagogy]] of a graphic design (or graphic communication, visual communication, graphic arts or any number of [[synonymous]] course titles) will be broadly based on the teaching models developed in the [[Bauhaus]] school in Germany or [[Vkhutemas]] in Russia. The teaching model will tend to expose students to a variety of craft skills (currently everything from drawing to motion capture), combined with an effort to engage the student with the world of [[visual culture]].\n\n== Noted graphic designers ==\n[[Aldus Manutius]] designed the first [[Italic type]] style which is often used in [[desktop publishing]] and [[graphic design]]. [[April Greiman]] is known for her influential [[poster]] design. [[Paul Rand]] is well known as a design pioneer for designing many popular corporate logos, including the logo for [[IBM]], [[NeXT]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]]. [[William Caslon]], during the mid-18th century, designed many typefaces, including ''ITC Founder's Caslon'', ''ITC Founder's Caslon Ornaments'', ''Caslon Graphique'', ''ITC Caslon No. 224'', ''Caslon Old Face'' and ''Big Caslon''.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Editorial cartoon]]\n* [[Visualization (graphics)]]\n* [[Semiotics]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n<!--\nDo not place advertisements here.\nCOMMERCIAL LINKS WILL BE REMOVED.\nWikipedia is not a link directory.
