The wavelength ''\u03bb'' of a sinusoidal waveform traveling at constant speed ''v'' is given by<ref name= Cassidy>\n{{cite book\n |title=Understanding physics\n |author1=David C.

In a ''dispersive'' medium, the phase speed itself depends upon the frequency of the wave, making the [[dispersion relation|relationship between wavelength and frequency]] nonlinear.\n\nIn the case of [[electromagnetic radiation]]\u2014such as light\u2014in [[free space]], the phase speed is the [[speed of light]], about 3\u00d710<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;m/s.  Thus the wavelength of a 100&nbsp;MHz electromagnetic (radio) wave is about: 3\u00d710<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;m/s divided by 10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Hz = 3 metres. The wavelength of visible light ranges from deep [[red]], roughly 700 [[nanometre|nm]], to [[Violet (color)|violet]], roughly 400&nbsp;nm (for other examples, see [[electromagnetic spectrum]]).\n\nFor [[sound wave]]s in air, the [[speed of sound]] is 343&nbsp;m/s (at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure|room temperature and atmospheric pressure]]). The wavelengths of sound frequencies audible to the human ear (20&nbsp;[[hertz|Hz]]\u201320&nbsp;kHz) are thus between approximately 17&nbsp;[[metre|m]] and 17&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]], respectively. Note that the wavelengths in audible sound are much longer than those in visible light.\n\n[[File:Waves in Box.svg|thumb|Sinusoidal standing waves in a box that constrains the end points to be nodes will have an integer number of half wavelengths fitting in the box.]]\n[[File:Standing wave 2.gif|thumb|right|A standing wave (black) depicted as the sum of two propagating waves traveling in opposite directions (red and blue)]]\n\n===Standing waves===\nA [[standing wave]] is an undulatory motion that stays in one place.  A sinusoidal standing wave includes stationary points of no motion, called [[node (physics)|nodes]], and the wavelength is twice the distance between nodes.\n\nThe upper figure shows three standing waves in a box. The walls of the box are considered to require the wave to have nodes at the walls of the box (an example of [[boundary conditions]]) determining which wavelengths are allowed. For example, for an electromagnetic wave,  if the box has ideal metal walls, the condition for nodes at the walls results because the metal walls cannot support a tangential electric field, forcing the wave to have zero amplitude at the wall.\n\nThe stationary wave can be viewed as the sum of two traveling sinusoidal waves of oppositely directed velocities.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = The World of Physics\n | author = John Avison\n | publisher = Nelson Thornes\n | year = 1999\n | isbn = 978-0-17-438733-6\n | page = 460\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DojwZzKAvN8C&pg=PA460&dq=%22standing+wave%22+wavelength\n }}</ref> Consequently, wavelength, period, and wave velocity are related just as for a traveling wave. For example, the [[Speed of light#Cavity resonance|speed of light]] can be determined from observation of standing waves in a metal box containing an ideal vacuum.\n\n===Mathematical representation===\nTraveling sinusoidal waves are often represented mathematically in terms of their velocity ''v'' (in the x direction), frequency ''f'' and wavelength ''\u03bb'' as:\n\n:<math>  y (x, \\ t) = A \\cos \\left( 2 \\pi \\left( \\frac{x}{\\lambda } - ft \\right ) \\right )  = A \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda} (x - vt) \\right )</math>\n\nwhere ''y'' is the value of the wave at any position ''x'' and time ''t'', and ''A'' is the [[amplitude]] of the wave.  They are also commonly expressed in terms of [[wavenumber]] ''k'' (2\u03c0 times the reciprocal of wavelength) and [[angular frequency]] ''\u03c9'' (2\u03c0 times the frequency) as:\n\n:<math>  y (x, \\ t) = A \\cos \\left( kx - \\omega t \\right)  = A \\cos \\left(k(x - v t) \\right) </math>\n\nin which wavelength and wavenumber are related to velocity and frequency as:\n\n:<math> k = \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda} = \\frac{2 \\pi f}{v} = \\frac{\\omega}{v},</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math> \\lambda = \\frac{2 \\pi}{k} = \\frac{2 \\pi v}{\\omega} = \\frac{v}{f}.</math>\n\nIn the second form given above, the phase {{nowrap|(''kx'' \u2212 ''\u03c9t'')}} is often generalized to {{nowrap|('''k'''\u2022'''r''' \u2212 ''\u03c9t'')}}, by replacing the wavenumber ''k'' with a [[wave vector]] that specifies the direction and wavenumber of a [[plane wave]] in [[3-space]], parameterized by position vector '''r'''.  In that case, the wavenumber ''k'', the magnitude of '''k''', is still in the same relationship with wavelength as shown above, with ''v'' being interpreted as scalar speed in the direction of the wave vector.  The first form, using reciprocal wavelength in the phase, does not generalize as easily to a wave in an arbitrary direction.\n\nGeneralizations to sinusoids of other phases, and to complex exponentials, are also common; see [[plane wave]].  The typical convention of using the [[cosine]] phase instead of the [[sine]] phase when describing a wave is based on the fact that the cosine is the real part of the complex exponential in the wave\n:<math>A e^{ i \\left( kx - \\omega t \\right)}. </math>\n\n===General media===\n[[File:Wavelength & refractive index.JPG|thumb|Wavelength is decreased in a medium with slower propagation.]]\n[[File:Refraction - Huygens-Fresnel principle.svg|right|thumb|Refraction: upon entering a medium where its speed is lower, the wave changes direction.]]\n[[File:Light dispersion conceptual waves.gif|thumb|Separation of colors by a prism (click for animation)]]\n\nThe speed of a wave depends upon the medium in which it propagates. In particular, the speed of light in a medium is less than in [[Vacuum#In electromagnetism|vacuum]], which means that the same frequency will correspond to a shorter wavelength in the medium than in vacuum, as shown in the figure at right.\n\nThis change in speed upon entering a medium causes [[refraction]], or a change in direction of waves that encounter the interface between media at an angle.<ref name=mud>\nTo aid imagination, this bending of the wave often is compared to the analogy of a column of marching soldiers crossing from solid ground into mud. See, for example, {{cite book |title=Principles of Planetary Climate |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bO_U8f5pVR8C&pg=PA327 |page=327 |year=2010 |author=Raymond T. Pierrehumbert |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-86556-5 }}\n\n</ref> For [[electromagnetic waves]], this change in the angle of propagation is governed by [[Snell's law]].\n\nThe wave velocity in one medium not only may differ from that in another, but the velocity typically varies with wavelength. As a result, the change in direction upon entering a different medium changes with the wavelength of the wave.\n\nFor electromagnetic waves the speed in a medium is governed by its ''[[refractive index]]'' according to\n:<math>v = \\frac{c}{n(\\lambda_0)},</math>\nwhere ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum and ''n''(\u03bb<sub>0</sub>) is the refractive index of the medium at wavelength \u03bb<sub>0</sub>, where the latter is measured in vacuum rather than in the medium. The corresponding wavelength in the medium is\n:<math>\\lambda = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{n(\\lambda_0)}.</math>\n\nWhen wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation are quoted, the wavelength in vacuum usually is intended unless the wavelength is specifically identified as the wavelength in some other medium.  In acoustics, where a medium is essential for the waves to exist, the wavelength value is given for a specified medium.\n\t\nThe variation in speed of light with vacuum wavelength is known as [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], and is also responsible for the familiar phenomenon in which light is separated into component colors by a [[dispersive prism|prism]]. Separation occurs when the refractive index inside the prism varies with wavelength, so different wavelengths propagate at different speeds inside the prism, causing them to [[refract]] at different angles. The mathematical relationship that describes how the speed of light within a medium varies with wavelength is known as a [[dispersion relation]].\n\n====Nonuniform media====\n[[File:Local wavelength.JPG|thumb|Various local wavelengths on a crest-to-crest basis in an ocean wave approaching shore<ref name=Pinet2/>]]\nWavelength can be a useful concept even if the wave is not [[periodic function|periodic]] in space. For example, in an ocean wave approaching shore, shown in the figure, the incoming wave undulates with a varying ''local'' wavelength that depends in part on the depth of the sea floor compared to the wave height. The analysis of the wave can be based upon comparison of the local wavelength with the local water depth.<ref name=Pinet2>\n{{cite book |title=op. cit.\n |author = Paul R Pinet\n |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6TCm8Xy-sLUC&pg=PA242\n |page = 242\n |isbn = 0-7637-5993-7\n }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cochlea wave animated.gif|right|thumb|A sinusoidal wave travelling in a nonuniform medium, with loss]]\nWaves that are sinusoidal in time but propagate through a medium whose properties vary with position (an ''inhomogeneous'' medium) may propagate at a velocity that varies with position, and as a result may not be sinusoidal in space. The figure at right shows an example. As the wave slows down, the wavelength gets shorter and the amplitude increases; after a place of maximum response, the short wavelength is associated with a high loss and the wave dies out.\n\nThe analysis of [[differential equation]]s of such systems is often done approximately, using the ''[[WKB approximation|WKB method]]'' (also known as the ''Liouville\u2013Green method'').

Accordingly, the condition for constructive interference is:<ref name=Halliday>\n{{cite book\n |title=Fundamentals of Physics\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RVCE4EUjDCgC&pg=PT965\n |page=965\n |chapter=\u00a735-4 Young's interference experiment\n |author=Halliday, Resnick, Walker\n |isbn=81-265-1442-6\n |year=2008\n |edition=Extended 8th\n |publisher=Wiley-India\n }}</ref>\n\n:<math> d \\sin \\theta = m \\lambda \\ , </math>\n\nwhere ''m'' is an integer, and for destructive interference is:\n\n:<math> d \\sin \\theta = (m + 1/2 )\\lambda \\ . </math>\n\nThus, if the wavelength of the light is known, the slit separation can be determined from the interference pattern or ''fringes'', and ''vice versa''.\n\nFor multiple slits, the pattern is <ref name=Harris>\n{{cite book |author=Kordt Griepenkerl|title=Handbook of physics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c60mCxGRMR8C&pg=PA307 |pages=307 ''ff'' |editor1=John W Harris |editor2=Walter Benenson |editor3=Horst St\u00f6cker |editor4=Holger Lutz |chapter= \u00a79.8.2 Diffraction by a grating |isbn=0-387-95269-1 |year=2002 |publisher=Springer}}\n</ref>\n:<math>I_q = I_1 \\sin^2 \\left( \\frac {q\\pi g \\sin \\alpha} {\\lambda} \\right)  /  \\sin^2  \\left( \\frac{ \\pi g \\sin \\alpha}{\\lambda}\\right) \\ , </math>\nwhere ''q'' is the number of slits, and ''g'' is the grating constant.

The main result of this interference is to spread out the light from the narrow slit into a broader image on the screen. This distribution of wave energy is called [[diffraction]].\n\nTwo types of diffraction are distinguished, depending upon the separation between the source and the screen: [[Fraunhofer diffraction]] or far-field diffraction at large separations and [[Fresnel diffraction]] or near-field diffraction at close separations.\n\nIn the analysis of the single slit, the non-zero width of the slit is taken into account, and each point in the aperture is taken as the source of one contribution to the beam of light (''Huygen's wavelets'').  On the screen, the light arriving from each position within the slit has a different path length, albeit possibly a very small difference.  Consequently, interference occurs.\n\nIn the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern sufficiently far from a single slit, within a [[small-angle approximation]], the intensity spread ''S'' is related to position ''x'' via a squared [[sinc function]]:<ref>{{cite book\n | title = Optical scattering: measurement and analysis\n | edition = 2nd\n | author = John C.

For example, the term ''[[subwavelength-diameter optical fibre]]'' means an [[optical fiber|optical fibre]] whose diameter is less than the wavelength of light propagating through it.\n\nA subwavelength particle is a particle smaller than the wavelength of light with which it interacts (see [[Rayleigh scattering]]).  Subwavelength [[aperture]]s are holes smaller than the wavelength of light propagating through them.  Such structures have applications in [[extraordinary optical transmission]], and [[zero-mode waveguide]]s, among other areas of [[photonics]].\n\n''Subwavelength'' may also refer to a phenomenon involving subwavelength objects; for example, [[subwavelength imaging]].\n\n==Angular wavelength==\n[[File:Commutative diagram of harmonic wave properties.svg|thumb|300px|Relationship between wavelength, angular wavelength, and other wave properties]]\nA quantity related to the wavelength is the '''angular wavelength''' (also known as '''reduced wavelength'''), usually symbolized by ''\u019b'' (lambda-bar). It is equal to the \"regular\" wavelength \"reduced\" by a factor of 2\u03c0 (''\u019b'' = ''\u03bb''/2\u03c0). It is usually encountered in quantum mechanics, where it is used in combination with the [[reduced Planck constant]] (symbol ''\u0127'', h-bar) and the [[angular frequency]] (symbol ''\u03c9'') or [[angular wavenumber]] (symbol ''k'').\n\n==See also==\n* [[Emission spectrum]]\n* [[Envelope (waves)]]\n* [[Fraunhofer lines]] \u2013 dark lines in the solar spectrum, traditionally used as standard optical wavelength references\n* [[Index of wave articles]]\n* [[Length measurement]]\n* [[Spectral line]]\n* [[Spectroscopy]]\n* [[Spectrum]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n{{Wikidata property|P2808}}\n*[http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-wavelength.htm Conversion: Wavelength to Frequency and vice versa \u2013 Sound waves and radio waves]\n*[http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/schools/index1.htm Teaching resource for 14\u201316 years on sound including wavelength]\n*[http://www.magnetkern.de/spektrum.html The visible electromagnetic spectrum displayed in web colors with according wavelengths]\n\n{{EMSpectrum}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Waves]]\n[[Category:Length]]"}]}}}}
