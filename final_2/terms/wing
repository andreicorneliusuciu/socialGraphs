As such, wings have an [[airfoil]] shape, a [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlined]] [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional]] shape producing [[Lift (force)|lift]].\n\nThe word \"wing\" from the Old Norse ''v\u00e6ngr''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=wing |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}</ref> for many centuries referred mainly to the foremost [[limb (anatomy)|limb]]s of [[bird]]s (in addition to the architectural aisle.) But in recent centuries the word's meaning has extended to include lift producing appendages of [[insect wing|insect]]s, [[bat]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, [[boomerangs]], [[Wingsail|some sail boats]] and [[aircraft]], or the inverted airfoil on a [[automobile racing|race car]] that generates a [[downforce|downward force]] to increase traction.\n\nVarious species of [[penguin]]s and other flighted or [[flightless bird|flightless]] water birds such as [[auk]]s, [[cormorant]]s, [[guillemot]]s,  [[shearwater]]s, [[eider duck|eider]] and scoter ducks and diving [[petrels]] are avid swimmers, and use their wings to propel through water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Swimming.html |title=Swimming |publisher=Stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}</ref>\n\nA wing's ''aerodynamic quality'' is expressed as its [[lift-to-drag ratio]]. The lift a wing generates at a given speed and [[angle of attack]] can be one to two [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] greater than the total [[drag (physics)|drag on the wing]]. A high lift-to-drag ratio requires a significantly smaller [[thrust]] to propel the wings through the air at sufficient lift.\n\n==Aerodynamics of wings==\nThe design and analysis of the wings of aircraft is one of the principal applications of the science of [[aerodynamics]], which is a branch of [[fluid mechanics]]. The properties of the airflow around any moving object can - in principle - be found by solving the [[Navier-Stokes equations]] of [[fluid dynamics]]. However, except for simple geometries these equations are notoriously difficult to solve.<ref name=Nasa_NS>{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/nseqs.html |title=Navier-Stokes Equations |publisher=[[Glenn Research Center|Grc.nasa.gov]] |date=2012-04-16 |accessdate=2012-04-25}}</ref> Fortunately, simpler explanations can be described.\n\nFor a wing to produce \"lift\", it must be oriented at a suitable [[angle of attack]] relative to the flow of air past the wing. When this occurs the wing deflects the airflow downwards, \"turning\" the air as it passes the wing.  Since the wing exerts a force on the air to change its direction, the air must exert a force on the wing, equal in size but opposite in direction.  This force manifests itself as differing air pressures at different points on the surface of the wing.<ref name=HR_378a>\"...the effect of the wing is to give the air stream a downward velocity component. The reaction force of the deflected air mass must then act on the wing to give it an equal and opposite upward component.\" In: {{citation\n | first1=David\n | last1=Halliday\n | first2=Robert\n | last2=Resnick\n | title=Fundamentals of Physics 3rd Edition\n | publisher=John Wiley & Sons\n | page=378\n}}</ref><ref>\"If the body is shaped, moved, or inclined in such a way as to produce a net deflection or turning of the flow, the local velocity is changed in magnitude, direction, or both.

(See: [[airfoil]]) These air pressure differences can be either measured directly using instrumentation, or can be calculated from the airspeed distribution using basic [[physics|physical principles]]\u2014including [[Bernoulli's Principle]], which relates changes in air speed to changes in air pressure.\n\nThe lower air pressure on the top of the wing generates a smaller downward force on the top of the wing than the upward force generated by the higher air pressure on the bottom of the wing. Hence, a net upward force acts on the wing. This force is called the \"lift\" generated by the wing.\n\nThe different velocities of the air passing by the wing, the air pressure differences, the change in direction of the airflow, and the lift on the wing are intrinsically one phenomenon. It is, therefore, possible to calculate lift from any of the other three. For example, the lift can be calculated from the pressure differences, or from different velocities of the air above and below the wing, or from the total momentum change of the deflected air. Fluid dynamics offers other approaches to solving these problems\u2014and all produce the same answers if done correctly. Given a particular wing and its velocity through the air, debates over which mathematical approach is the ''most convenient'' to use can be mistaken by novices as differences of opinion about the basic principles of flight.\n\nFor a more detailed coverage see [[lift (force)]].\n\n===Devices to change the shape of a wing===\n\nUsually, aircraft wings have various devices, such as flaps or slats that the pilot uses to modify the shape and surface area of the wing to change its operating characteristics in flight. In 1948, [[Francis Rogallo]] invented the fully limp flexible wing, which ushered in new possibilities for aircraft. Near in time, [[Domina Jalbert]] invented flexible un-sparred ram-air airfoiled thick wings. These two new branches of wings have been since extensively studied and applied in new branches of aircraft, especially altering the personal recreational aviation landscape.\n\n===A common misconception===\nA common misconception is that, to generate lift, a wing ''must'' have a longer air path across its topside compared with its underside.<ref>http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/wrong1.html</ref>  Wings with this shape are the norm in [[subsonic flight]], but symmetrically shaped wings (above and below) can generate lift by using a positive [[angle of attack]] to deflect air downward. Symmetrical airfoils have higher [[Stall (flight)|stalling]] speeds than [[Camber (aerodynamics)|cambered airfoils]] of the same wing area<ref>E. V. Laitone, Wind tunnel tests of wings at Reynolds numbers below 70 000, ''Experiments in Fluids'' '''23''', ''405'' (1997). {{doi|10.1007/s003480050128}}</ref> but are used in [[aerobatic]] aircraft{{fact|date=January 2015}} as they provide practical performance whether the aircraft is upright or inverted. Another example comes from sailboats, where the sail is a thin membrane with no path-length difference between one side and the other.<ref name=Babinsky>\"...consider a sail that is\nnothing but a vertical wing (generating side-force to propel a yacht). ...it is obvious that the distance between the stagnation point and the trailing edge is more or less the same on both sides. This becomes exactly true in the absence of a mast\u2014and clearly the presence of the mast is of no consequence in the generation of lift. ''Thus, the generation of lift does not require different distances around the upper and lower surfaces.''\" Holger Babinsky ''How do Wings Work?'' Physics Education November 2003, [http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9120/38/6/001/pdf/pe3_6_001.pdf PDF]</ref>\n\nFor flight speeds near the speed of sound ([[transonic flight]]), airfoils with complex asymmetrical shapes are used to minimize the drastic increase in drag associated with airflow near the speed of sound.<ref>John D. Anderson, Jr. ''Introduction to Flight'' 4th ed page 271.</ref>  Such airfoils, called [[supercritical airfoil]]s, are flat on top and curved on the bottom.<ref> 'Supercritical wings have a flat-on-top \"upside down\" look.' NASA Dryden Flight Research Center http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/about/Organizations/Technology/Facts/TF-2004-13-DFRC.html </ref>\n\n===Other examples===\n\nThe science of wings applies in other areas beyond conventional [[fixed-wing aircraft]], including:\n*[[Hang glider]]s, which use wings ranging from fully flexible ([[paraglider]]s, gliding [[parachute]]s), flexible (framed sail wings), to rigid\n*[[Kite types|Kites]], which use a vast variety of wings.\n*[[Free flight (model aircraft)|Flying model airplane]]s\n*[[Helicopter]]s, which use a rotating wing with a variable pitch angle to provide directional forces\n*[[Propeller]]s, whose blades generate lift for propulsion.\n*The [[NASA]] [[Space Shuttle]], which uses its wings only to glide during its descent to a runway. These types of aircraft are called [[spaceplane]]s.\n*Some [[racing cars]], especially [[Formula One car]]s, which use upside-down wings (or ''[[airfoil]]s'') to provide greater traction at high speeds\n*[[Sailboat]]s, which use sails as vertical wings with variable fullness and direction to move across water\n\nStructures with the same purpose as wings, but designed for use in liquid media, are generally called [[fin]]s or [[hydrofoil]]s, with [[hydrodynamics]] as the governing science, rather than [[aerodynamics]]. Applications of these arise in craft such as [[Hydroplane_(boat)|hydroplane]]s and [[submarine]]s. [[Sailboat]]s and [[sailing ship]]s use both fins and wings.\n\n==Design features==\nAircraft wings may feature some of the following:\n*A rounded [[leading edge]] cross-section\n*A sharp [[trailing edge]] cross-section\n*Leading-edge devices such as [[leading edge slats|slats]], [[leading edge slot|slots]], or [[leading edge extension|extension]]s\n*Trailing-edge devices such as [[flap (aircraft)|flap]]s or flaperons (combination of flaps and ailerons)\n*[[Aileron]]s (usually near the wingtips) to roll the aircraft clockwise or counterclockwise about its long axis\n*[[Spoiler (aeronautics)|Spoiler]]s on the upper surface to disrupt the lift and to provide additional traction to an aircraft that has just landed but is still moving.\n*[[Vortex generator]]s to help prevent flow separation in transonic flow\n*[[Wing fence]]s to keep flow attached to the wing by stopping boundary layer separation from spreading\n*[[Winglets]] to keep wingtip vortices from increasing drag and decreasing lift\n*[[Dihedral (aircraft)|Dihedral]], or a positive wing angle to the horizontal. This gives inherent stability in the roll direction. Anhedral, or a negative wing angle to the horizontal, has a destabilizing effect\n*[[Folding wing]]s allow more aircraft storage in the confined space of the [[hangar|hangar deck]] of an [[aircraft carrier]]\n*[[Variable-sweep wing]] or \"swing wings\" that allow outstretched wings during low-speed flight (i.e., take-off and landing) and [[swept wing|swept back wing]]s for high-speed flight (including [[supersonic flight]]), such as in the [[F-111 Aardvark]], the [[F-14 Tomcat]], the [[Panavia Tornado]], the [[MiG-23]], the [[MiG-27]], the [[Tu-160]] and the [[B-1B Lancer]] warplanes\n\n==See also==\n*[[Flight]]\nNatural world:\n*[[Bird flight]]\n*[[Flight feather]]\n*[[Flying and gliding animals]]\n*[[Insect flight]]\n*[[List of soaring birds]]\n*[[Samara (fruit)|Samara]] (winged seeds of trees)\nAviation:\n*[[FanWing]] and [[Flettner airplane]] (experimental wing types)\n*[[Kite types]]\n*[[Ornithopter]] - Flapping-wing aircraft (research prototypes, simple toys and models)\n*[[Otto Lilienthal]]\n*[[Wing configuration]]\n*[[Wing suit]]\nSailing:\n*[[Sails]]\n*[[Forces on sails]]\n*[[Wingsail]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Wings (aerodynamics)|Wings}}\n*[http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0031-9120/38/6/001/pe3_6_001.pdf How Wings Work - Holger Babinsky <u>Physics Education</u> 2003]\n<!-- broken link: *[http://user.uni-frankfurt.de/~weltner/Flight/PHYSIC4.htm \"Physics of flight - revisited\" Weltner and Ingelman-Sundberg ] -->\n*[http://www.aviation-history.com/theory/lift.htm How Airplanes Fly: A Physical Description of Lift]\n*[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3875411 Demystifying the Science of Flight] - Audio segment on NPR's Talk of the Nation Science Friday\n*[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/short.html NASA's explanations and simulations]\n<!--The following link is not operating at present:<br />\n*[http://aerodyn.org/Wings/ Advanced Topics in Aerodynamics] Wings for all speeds-->\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4E6M2VGQyk Flight of the StyroHawk wing]\n*[http://www.av8n.com/how/htm/airfoils.html See How It Flies]\n\n{{fins, limbs and wings}}\n\n[[Category:Aerodynamics]]\n[[Category:Aerospace engineering]]\n[[Category:Aircraft wing components]]\n[[Category:Bird anatomy]]\n[[Category:Bird flight]]\n\n[[es:Ala (zoolog\u00eda)]]\n[[fr:Voilure (a\u00e9ronautique)]]"}]}}}}
