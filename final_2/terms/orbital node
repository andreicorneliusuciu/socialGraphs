For geocentric and heliocentric orbits, the '''ascending node''' (or '''north node''') is where the orbiting object moves north through the plane of reference, and the '''descending node''' (or '''south node''') is where it moves south through the plane.<ref name=\"darlingasc\">[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ascending_node.html ascending node], entry in ''The Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Astronomy, and Spaceflight'', David Darling, on line, accessed May 17, 2007.</ref> In the case of objects outside the Solar System, the ascending node is the node where the orbiting secondary passes away from the observer, and the descending node is the node where it moves towards the observer.<ref>''The Binary Stars'', R.

This is done by specifying the [[longitude of the ascending node]] (or, sometimes, the [[longitude of the node]].)\n\nThe '''line of nodes''' is the intersection of the object's orbital plane with the plane of reference. It passes through the two nodes.<ref name=\"darlinglon\" />\n\n== Symbols and nomenclature ==\n\nThe symbol of the ascending node is [[Image:Northnode-symbol.png]] ([[Unicode]]: U+260A, \u260a), and the symbol of the descending node is [[Image:Southnode-symbol.png]] ([[Unicode]]: U+260B, \u260b). In medieval and early modern times the ascending and descending nodes were called the ''dragon's head'' ([[Latin]]: ''caput draconis'', [[Arabic]]: ''ra's al-jauzahar'') and ''dragon's tail'' ({{lang-la|cauda draconis}}), respectively.<ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0065-9746%281956%292%3A46%3A2%3C123%3AASOIAT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-8 Survey of Islamic Astronomical Tables], E.
