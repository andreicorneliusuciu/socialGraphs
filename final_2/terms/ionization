[[Heterolytic bond cleavage]] and heterolytic [[substitution reaction]]s can result in the formation of ion pairs. Ionization can occur through radioactive decay by the [[internal conversion]] process, in which an excited nucleus transfers its energy to one of the [[inner-shell electrons]] causing it to be ejected.\n\n==Uses==\nEveryday examples of gas ionization are such as within a [[fluorescent lamp]] or other [[electrical discharge]] lamps. It is also used in radiation detectors such as the [[Geiger-M\u00fcller counter]] or the [[ionization chamber]]. The ionization process is widely used in a variety of equipment in fundamental science and in such as [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectroscopy]] and [[radiotherapy]].\n\n==Production of ions==\n[[File:Electron avalanche.gif|thumb|350px|Avalanche effect between two electrodes. The original ionization event liberates one electron, and each subsequent collision liberates a further electron, so two electrons emerge from each collision: the ionizing electron and the liberated electron.]]\nNegatively charged ions are produced when a free electron collides with an atom and is subsequently trapped inside the electric potential barrier, releasing any excess energy. The process is known as [[electron capture ionization]].\n\nPositively charged ions are produced by transferring a sufficient amount of energy to a bound electron in a collision with charged particles (e.g. ions, electrons or positrons) or with photons. The threshold amount of the required energy is known as [[ionization potential]].  The study of such collisions is of fundamental importance with regard to the few-body problem (see article on [[few-body systems]]), which is one of the major unsolved problems in physics.

It is a cascade reaction involving [[electron]]s in a region with a sufficiently high [[electric field]] in a gaseous medium that can be ionized, such as [[air]]. Following an original ionization event, due to such as ionizing radiation, the positive [[ion]] drifts towards the [[cathode]], while the free electron drifts towards the [[anode]] of the device. If the electric field is strong enough, the free electron gains sufficient energy to liberate a further electron when it next collides with another molecule. The two free electrons then travel towards the anode and gain sufficient energy from the electric field to cause impact ionization when the next collisions occur; and so on. This is effectively a chain reaction of electron generation, and is dependent on the free electrons gaining sufficient energy between collisions to sustain the avalanche.<ref>Glenn F Knoll.

Ionization energies of neutral elements.]]\nThe trend in the [[ionization energy]] of atoms is often used to demonstrate the periodic behavior of atoms with respect to the atomic number, as summarized by ordering atoms in  [[Mendeleev's table]]. This is a valuable tool for establishing and understanding the ordering of electrons in [[atomic orbitals]] without going into the details of wave functions or the ionization process. An example is presented in '''figure 1'''. The periodic abrupt decrease in ionization potential after rare gas atoms, for instance, indicates the emergence of a new shell in [[alkali metals]]. In addition, the local maximums in the ionization energy plot, moving from left to right in a row, are indicative of s, p, d, and f sub-shells.\n\n==Semi-classical description of ionization==\n[[Classical physics]] and the [[Bohr model]] of the atom can qualitatively explain [[photoionization]] and collision-mediated ionization. In these cases, during the ionization process, the energy of the electron exceeds the energy difference of the potential barrier it is trying to pass. The semi-classical description, however, cannot describe [[tunnel ionization]] since the process involves the passage of electron through a classically forbidden potential barrier.\n\n==Quantum mechanical description of ionization==\nThe interaction of atoms and molecules with sufficiently strong laser pulses leads to the ionization to singly or multiply charged ions. The ionization rate, i.e. the ionization probability in unit time, can only be calculated using [[quantum mechanics]]. In general, the analytic solutions are not available, and the approximations required for manageable numerical calculations do not provide accurate enough results. However, when the laser intensity is sufficiently high, the detailed structure of the atom or molecule can be ignored and analytic solution for the ionization rate is possible.\n\n===Tunnel ionization===\n[[File:Tunnel ionization 3.png|thumb|500px|Combined potential of an atom and a uniform laser field. At distances r<r0, the potential of the laser can be neglected, while at distances with r>r0 the Coulomb potential is negligible compared to the potential of the laser field. The electron emerges from under the barrier at r = Rc. Ei is the ionization potential of the atom.]]\n\n[[Tunnel ionization]] is ionization due to [[quantum tunneling]]. In classical ionization, an electron must have enough energy to make it over the potential barrier, but quantum tunneling allows the electron simply to go through the potential barrier instead of going all the way over it because of the wave nature of the electron. The probability of an electron's tunneling through the barrier drops off exponentially with the width of the potential barrier. Therefore, an electron with a higher energy can make it further up the potential barrier, leaving a much thinner barrier to tunnel through and, thus, a greater chance to do so. In practice, tunnel ionization is observable when the atom or molecule is interacting with near-infrared strong laser pulses. This process can be understood as a process by which a bounded electron, through  the absorption of more than one photon from the laser field, is ionized. This picture is generally known as multiphoton ionization (MPI).\n\nKeldysh<ref>{{cite journal |last=Keldysh |first=L.

Phys. 94 250</ref> In this model the perturbation of the ground state by the laser field is neglected and the details of atomic structure in determining the ionization probability are not taken into account. The major difficulty with Keldysh's model was its neglect of the effects of Coulomb interaction on the final state of the electron. As it is observed from figure,  the Coulomb field is not  very small in magnitude compared to the potential of the laser at larger distances from the  nucleus. This is in contrast to the approximation made by neglecting the potential of the laser at regions near the  nucleus. Perelomov et al.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Perelomov |first1=A.

These states were believed to have been excited by the dynamic Stark shift of the levels into multiphoton resonance with the field during the rising part of the laser pulse. Subsequent evolution of the laser pulse did not ionize completely these states leaving behind some highly excited atoms.

These levels along with the continuum constitute a lambda system.  The mechanism of the lambda type trapping is schematically presented in figure. At the rising part of the pulse (a) the excited state (with two degenerate levels 1 and 2) are not in multiphoton resonance with the ground state. The electron is ionized through multiphoton coupling with the continuum. As the intensity of the pulse is increased the excited state and the continuum are shifted in energy due to the Stark shift. At the peak of the pulse (b) the excited states go into multiphoton resonance with the ground state. As the intensity starts to decrease (c), the two state are coupled through continuum and the population is trapped in a coherent superposition of the two states. Under subsequent action of the same pulse, due to interference in the transition amplitudes of the lambda system, the field cannot ionize the population completely and a fraction of the population will be trapped in a coherent superposition of the quasi degenerate levels. According to this explanation the states with higher angular momentum- with more sublevels- would have a higher probability of trapping the population. In general the strength of the trapping will be determined by the strength of the two photon coupling between the quasi-degenerate levels via the continuum.In 1996, using the very stable laser and by minimizing the masking effects of the focal region expansion with increasing intensity, Talebpour et al.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Talebpour |first1=A. |last2=Chien |first2=C.

The SO model describes the NS process as a mechanism where one electron is ionized by the laser field and the departure of this electron is so rapid that the remaining electrons do not have enough time to adjust themselves to the new energy states. Therefore, there is a certain probability that, after the ionization of the first electron, a second electron is excited to states with higher energy (shake-up) or even ionized (shake-off). We should mention that, until now, there has been no quantitative calculation based on the SO model, and the model is still qualitative.\n\nThe electron rescattering model was independently developed by Kuchiev,<ref>[http://www.jetpletters.ac.ru/ps/1241/article_18763.pdf]{{cite journal |last=Kuchiev |first=M.

Corkum's model describes the NS ionization as a process whereby an electron is tunnel ionized. The electron then interacts with the laser field where it is accelerated away from the nuclear core. If the electron has been ionized at an appropriate phase of the field, it will pass by the position of the remaining ion half a cycle later, where it can free an additional electron by electron impact. Only half of the time the electron is  released with the appropriate phase and the other half  it never return to the nuclear core. The maximum kinetic energy that the returning electron can have is 3.17 times the ponderomotive potential (<math> U_p </math>) of the laser. Corkum's model  places a cut-off limit on the minimum intensity (<math> U_p </math> is proportional to intensity) where ionization due to re-scattering can occur. \n[[File:Kuchiev's model.png|thumb|Feynman diagram for the process of double ionization in an atom through re-scattering mechanism]]\nThe re-scattering model in Kuchiev's version (Kuchiev's model) is quantum mechanical. The basic idea of the model is illustrated  by Feynman diagrams in figure a. First both electrons are in the ground state of an atom. The lines marked a and b describe the corresponding atomic states. Then the electron a is ionized. The beginning of the ionization process is shown by the intersection with a sloped dashed line. where the MPI occurs. The propagation of the ionized electron in the laser field, during which it absorbs other photons (ATI), is shown by the full thick  line. The collision of this electron with the parent atomic ion is shown by a vertical dotted line representing the Coulomb interaction between the electrons. The state marked with c describes the ion excitation to a discrete or continuum state. Figure b describes the exchange process. Kuchiev's model, contrary to Corkum's model, does not predict any threshold intensity for the occurrence of NS ionization.\n\nKuciev did not include the Coulomb effects on the dynamics of the ionized electron. This resulted in the underestimation of the double ionization rate by a huge factor. Obviously, in the approach of Becker and Faisal (which is equivalent to Kuchiev's model in spirit), this drawback does not exist. In fact, their model is more exact and does not suffer from the large number of approximations made by Kuchiev. Their calculation results perfectly fit with the experimental results of Walker et al.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=B. |last2=Sheehy |first2=B. |last3=Dimauro |first3=L.

As an example, the molecules of table sugar dissociate in water (sugar is dissolved) but exist as intact neutral entities. Another subtle event is the dissociation of [[sodium chloride]] (table salt) into sodium and chlorine ions. Although it may seem as a case of ionization, in reality the ions already exist within the crystal lattice. When salt is dissociated, its constituent ions are simply surrounded by water molecules and their effects are visible (e.g. the solution becomes [[electrolytic]]). However, no transfer or displacement of electrons occurs. Actually, the chemical synthesis of salt involves ionization. This is a chemical reaction.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Above threshold ionization]]\n*[[Adiabatic ionization]]\n*[[Ionization chamber]] \u2013 Instrument for detecting gaseous ionization, used in ionizing radiation measurements\n*[[Ion source]]\n*[[Photoionization]] and [[photoionization mode]]\n*[[Thermal ionization]]\n*[[Electron ionization]]\n*[[Chemical ionization]]\n*[[Townsend avalanche]] \u2013 The chain reaction of ionization occurring in a gas with an applied electric field\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Wiktionary-inline}}\n\n{{States of matter}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Ions]]\n[[Category:Molecular physics]]\n[[Category:Atomic physics]]\n[[Category:Physical chemistry]]\n[[Category:Quantum chemistry]]\n[[Category:Mass spectrometry]]\n[[Category:Ionization| ]]"}]}}}}
