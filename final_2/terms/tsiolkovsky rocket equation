In free space, for the case of acceleration in the direction of the velocity, this is the increase of the speed. In the case of an acceleration in opposite direction (deceleration) it is the decrease of the speed. Of course gravity and drag also accelerate the vehicle, and they can add or subtract to the change in velocity experienced by the vehicle. Hence delta-v is not usually the actual change in speed or velocity of the vehicle.\n\nIf [[special relativity]] is taken into account, the following equation can be derived for a [[relativistic rocket]],<ref>Forward, Robert L. [http://www.relativitycalculator.com/images/rocket_equations/AIAA.pdf \"A Transparent Derivation of the Relativistic Rocket Equation\"] (see the right side of equation 15 on the last page, with R as the ratio of initial to final mass and w as the exhaust velocity, corresponding to v<sub>e</sub> in the notation of this article)</ref> with <math>\\Delta v</math> again standing for the rocket's final velocity (after burning off all its fuel and being reduced to a rest mass of <math>m_1</math>) in the [[inertial frame of reference]] where the rocket started at rest (with the rest mass including fuel being <math>m_0</math> initially), and <math>c</math> standing for the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum:\n\n:<math>\\frac{m_0}{m_1} = \\left[\\frac{1 + {\\frac{\\Delta v}{c}}}{1 - {\\frac{\\Delta v}{c}}}\\right]^{\\frac{c}{2v_e}}</math>\n\nWriting <math>\\frac{m_0}{m_1}</math> as <math>R</math>, a little algebra allows this equation to be rearranged as\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\Delta v}{c} = \\frac{R^{\\frac{2v_e}{c}} - 1}{R^{\\frac{2v_e}{c}} + 1}</math>\n\nThen, using the [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]] <math>R^{\\frac{2v_e}{c}} = \\exp \\left[ \\frac{2v_e}{c} \\ln R \\right]</math> (here \"exp\" denotes the [[exponential function]]; ''see also'' [[Natural logarithm]] as well as the \"power\" identity at [[Logarithm#Product, quotient, power and root|Logarithmic identities]]) and the identity <math>\\tanh x = \\frac{e^{2x} - 1} {e^{2x} + 1}</math> (''see'' [[Hyperbolic function]]), this is equivalent to\n\n:<math>\\Delta v = c \\cdot \\tanh \\left(\\frac {v_e}{c} \\ln \\frac{m_0}{m_1} \\right)</math>\n\n===Other derivations===\n\n====Impulse-based====\nThe equation can also be derived from the basic integral of acceleration in the form of force (thrust) over mass.\nBy representing the delta-v equation as the following:\n:<math>\\Delta v = \\int^{t1}_{t0} \\frac{|T|}{{m_0}-\\Delta{m} {t}} ~ dt</math>\n\nwhere T is thrust, <math>m_0</math> is the initial (wet) mass and <math>\\Delta m</math> is the initial mass minus the final (dry) mass,\n\nand realising that the integral of a resultant force over time is total impulse, assuming thrust is the only force involved,\n:<math>\\int^{t1}_{t0} F ~ dt = J</math>\n\nThe integral is found to be:\n:<math>J ~ \\frac{\\ln({m_0}) - \\ln({m_1})}{\\Delta m}</math>\n\nRealising that impulse over the change in mass is equivalent to force over propellant mass flow rate (p), which is itself equivalent to exhaust velocity,\n:<math> \\frac{J}{\\Delta m} = \\frac{F}{p} = V_{exh}</math>\n\nthe integral can be equated to\n:<math>\\Delta v = V_{exh} ~ \\ln\\left({\\frac{m_0}{m_1}}\\right)</math>\n\n====Acceleration-based====\n\nImagine a rocket at rest in space with no forces exerted on it ([[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's First Law of Motion]]). However, as soon as its engine is started (clock set to 0) the rocket is expelling gas mass at a ''constant mass flow rate M'' (kg/s) and at ''exhaust velocity relative to the rocket v<sub>e</sub>'' (m/s). This creates a constant force propelling the rocket that is equal to ''M \u00d7 v<sub>e</sub>''. The mass of fuel the rocket initially has on board is equal to ''m<sub>0</sub> - m<sub>f</sub>''. It will therefore take a time that is equal to ''(m<sub>0</sub> - m<sub>f</sub>)/M'' to burn all this fuel. Now, the rocket is subject to a constant force (M \u00d7 v<sub>e</sub>), but at the same time its total weight is decreasing steadily because it's expelling gas. According to [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Second Law of Motion]], this can have only one consequence; its acceleration is increasing steadily. To obtain the acceleration, the propelling force has to be divided by the rocket's total mass. So, the level of acceleration at any moment (''t'') after ignition and until the fuel runs out is given by;\n\n:<math> ~ \\frac{M  v_e}{m_0 - (M  t)}.</math>\n\nSince the time it takes to burn the fuel is ''(m<sub>0</sub> - m<sub>f</sub>)/M'' the acceleration reaches its maximum of\n:<math> ~ \\frac{M  v_e}{m_f}</math>\nthe moment the last fuel is expelled. Since the exhaust velocity is related to the [[specific impulse]] in unit time as \n:<math>I_{\\rm sp}=\\frac{v_\\text{e}}{g_0},</math><ref name=\"SINasa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/specimp.html|title=Specific impulse|last=Benson|first=Tom|date= 2008-07-11|publisher=NASA|accessdate= 2009-12-22}}</ref>\nwhere ''g<sub>0</sub>'' is the [[standard gravity]], the corresponding maximum [[g-force]] is\n:<math> ~ \\frac{M  I_{\\rm sp}}{m_f}.</math>\nSince speed is the definite [[Integral|integration]] of acceleration, and the integration has to start at ignition and end the moment the last propellant leaves the rocket, the following definite integral yields the speed at the moment the fuel runs out;\n\n:<math> ~ \\int^{\\frac{m_0-m_f}{M}}_{0} \\frac{M  v_e}{m_0 - (M  t)} ~ dt = ~ - v_e  \\ln(m_f) + v_e  \\ln(m_0) = ~ v_e  \\ln\\left(\\frac{m_0}{m_f}\\right) </math>\n\n==Terms of the equation==\n\n===Delta-''v''===\n{{main article|Delta-v}}\nDelta-''v'' (literally \"[[Delta (letter)#Upper case|change]] in [[velocity]]\"), symbolised as '''\u0394''v''''' and pronounced ''delta-vee'', as used in [[flight dynamics (spacecraft)|spacecraft flight dynamics]], is a measure of the [[impulse (physics)|impulse]] that is needed to perform a maneuver such as launch from, or landing on a planet or moon, or in-space [[orbital maneuver]]. It is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] that has the units of [[speed]]. As used in this context, it is ''not'' the same as the [[delta-v (physics)|physical change in velocity]] of the vehicle.\n\nDelta-''v'' is produced by reaction engines, such as [[rocket engines]] and is proportional to the [[thrust]] per unit mass, and burn time, and is used to determine the mass  of [[rocket propellant|propellant]] required for the given manoeuvre through the rocket equation.\n\nFor multiple manoeuvres, delta-''v'' sums linearly.\n\nFor interplanetary missions delta-''v'' is often plotted on a [[porkchop plot]] which displays the required mission delta-''v'' as a function of launch date.\n\n===Mass fraction===\n{{main article|Propellant mass fraction}}\nIn [[aerospace engineering]], the propellant mass fraction is the portion of a vehicle's mass which does not reach the destination, usually used as a measure of the vehicle's performance. In other words, the propellant mass fraction is the ratio between the propellant mass and the initial mass of the vehicle. In a spacecraft, the destination is usually an orbit, while for aircraft it is their landing location. A higher mass fraction represents less weight in a design.  Another related measure is the [[payload fraction]], which is the fraction of initial weight that is payload.\n\n===Effective exhaust velocity===\n{{main article|effective exhaust velocity}}\nThe effective exhaust velocity is often specified as a [[specific impulse]] and they are related to each other by:\n\n:<math>v_\\text{e} = g_0 I_\\text{sp},</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>I_\\text{sp}</math> is the specific impulse in seconds,\n\n:<math>v_\\text{e}</math> is the specific impulse measured in [[metre per second|m/s]], which is the same as the effective exhaust velocity measured in m/s (or ft/s if g is in ft/s<sup>2</sup>),\n\n:<math>g_0</math> is the acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface, 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup> (in [[Imperial units]] 32.2 ft/s<sup>2</sup>).\n\n==Applicability==\nThe rocket equation captures the essentials of rocket flight physics in a single short equation. It also holds true for rocket-like reaction vehicles whenever the effective exhaust velocity is constant, and can be summed or integrated when the effective exhaust velocity varies. The rocket equation only accounts for the reaction force from the rocket engine; it does not include other forces that may act on a rocket, such as [[aerodynamic force|aerodynamic]] or [[gravitation]]al forces. As such, when using it to calculate the propellant requirement for launch from (or powered descent to) a planet with an atmosphere, the effects of these forces must be included in the delta-V requirement (see Examples below). In what has been called \"the tyranny of the rocket equation\", there is a limit to the amount of [[Payload fraction|payload]] that the airship can carry, as higher amounts of propellant increment the overall weight, and thus also increase the fuel consumption.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html|title=NASA - The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-04-18}}</ref> The equation does not apply to [[Non-rocket spacelaunch|non-rocket systems]] such as [[aerobraking]], [[Space gun|gun launch]]es, [[space elevator]]s, [[launch loop]]s, or [[tether propulsion]].\n\nThe rocket equation can be applied to [[orbital maneuver]]s in order to determine how much propellant is needed to change to a particular new orbit, or to find the new orbit as the result of a particular propellant burn. When applying to orbital maneuvers, one assumes an [[Orbital maneuver|impulsive maneuver]], in which the propellant is discharged and delta-v applied instantaneously. This assumption is relatively accurate for short-duration burns such as for mid-course corrections and orbital insertion maneuvers. As the burn duration increases, the result is less accurate due to the effect of gravity on the vehicle over the duration of the maneuver. For low-thrust, long duration propulsion, such as [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]], more complicated analysis based on the propagation of the spacecraft's state vector and the integration of thrust are used to predict orbital motion.\n\n==Examples==\nAssume an exhaust velocity of {{convert|4500|m/s|ft/s|sp=us}} and a <math>\\Delta v</math> of {{convert|9700|m/s|ft/s|sp=us}} (Earth to [[low Earth orbit|LEO]], including <math>\\Delta v</math> to overcome gravity and aerodynamic drag).\n\n*[[Single-stage-to-orbit]] rocket: <math>1-e^{-9.7/4.5}</math> = 0.884, therefore 88.4% of the initial total mass has to be propellant. The remaining 11.6% is for the engines, the tank, and the payload. In the case of a space shuttle, it would also include the orbiter.\n*[[Two-stage-to-orbit]]: suppose that the first stage should provide a <math>\\Delta v</math> of {{convert|5000|m/s|ft/s|sp=us}}; <math>1-e^{-5.0/4.5}</math> = 0.671, therefore 67.1% of the initial total mass has to be propellant to the first stage. The remaining mass is 32.9%. After disposing of the first stage, a mass remains equal to this 32.9%, minus the mass of the tank and engines of the first stage. Assume that this is 8% of the initial total mass, then 24.9% remains. The second stage should provide a <math>\\Delta v</math> of {{convert|4700|m/s|ft/s|sp=us}}; <math>1-e^{-4.7/4.5}</math> = 0.648, therefore 64.8% of the remaining mass has to be propellant, which is 16.2%, and 8.7% remains for the tank and engines of the second stage, the payload, and in the case of a space shuttle, also the orbiter. Thus together 16.7% is available for all engines, the tanks, the payload, and the possible orbiter.\n\n==Stages==\nIn the case of sequentially thrusting [[Staging (rocketry)|rocket stages]], the equation applies for each stage, where for each stage the initial mass in the equation is the total mass of the rocket after discarding the previous stage, and the final mass in the equation is the total mass of the rocket just before discarding the stage concerned. For each stage the specific impulse may be different.\n\nFor example, if 80% of the mass of a rocket is the fuel of the first stage, and 10% is the dry mass of the first stage, and 10% is the remaining rocket, then\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta v \\ & = v_\\text{e} \\ln { 100 \\over 100 - 80 }\\\\\n           & = v_\\text{e} \\ln 5 \\\\\n           & = 1.61 v_\\text{e}. \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nWith three similar, subsequently smaller stages with the same <math>v_e</math> for each stage, we have\n\n:<math>\\Delta v \\ = 3 v_\\text{e} \\ln 5 \\ = 4.83 v_\\text{e} </math>\n\nand the payload is 10%*10%*10% = 0.1% of the initial mass.\n\nA comparable [[Single-stage-to-orbit|SSTO]] rocket, also with a 0.1% payload, could have a mass of 11.1% for fuel tanks and engines, and 88.8% for fuel. This would give\n\n:<math>\\Delta v \\ = v_\\text{e} \\ln(100/11.2) \\ = 2.19 v_\\text{e}. </math>\n\nIf the motor of a new stage is ignited before the previous stage has been discarded and the simultaneously working motors have a different specific impulse (as is often the case with solid rocket boosters and a liquid-fuel stage), the situation is more complicated.\n\n==Common misconceptions==\n\nWhen viewed as a [[variable-mass system]], a rocket cannot be directly analyzed with [[Newton's second law of motion]] because the law is valid for constant-mass systems only.<ref name=\"plastino\">{{cite journal|last=Plastino|first=Angel R. |author2=Muzzio, Juan C. |date=1992|title=On the use and abuse of Newton's second law for variable mass problems|journal=Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Netherlands|volume= 53|issue= 3|pages=227\u2013232|issn=0923-2958|bibcode=1992CeMDA..53..227P|doi=10.1007/BF00052611}} \"We may conclude emphasizing that Newton's second law is valid for constant mass only.
