Distortion is usually unwanted, and so engineers strive to eliminate distortion, or minimize it.  In some situations, however, distortion may be desirable. The important signal processing operation of [[heterodyning]] is based on nonlinear mixing of signals to cause intermodulation. Distortion is also used as a [[Distortion (music)|musical effect]], particularly with electric guitars.\n\nThe addition of [[Electronic noise|noise]] or other outside signals ([[mains hum|hum]], [[interference (communication)|interference]]) is not deemed distortion, though the effects of [[quantization distortion]] are sometimes deemed noise. A quality measure that explicitly reflects both the noise and the distortion is the [[Signal-to-noise-and-distortion]] (SINAD) ratio.\n\n==Electronic signals==\n[[File:Distorted waveforms square sine.svg|353px|thumb|right|Graph of a waveform and some distorted versions of the same waveform]]\n\nIn [[telecommunication]] and [[signal processing]], a noise-free [[system]] can be characterised by a [[transfer function]], such that the output <math>y(t)</math> can be written as a function of the input <math>x</math> as\n\n: <math>y(t) = F(x(t))</math>\n\nWhen the transfer function comprises only a perfect [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] constant ''A'' and perfect [[Propagation delay|delay]] ''T''\n\n: <math>y(t) = A\\cdot x(t-T)</math>\n\nthe output is undistorted. Distortion occurs when the transfer function ''F'' is more complicated than this. If ''F'' is a [[linear function]], for instance a filter whose gain and/or delay varies with frequency, the signal suffers linear distortion. Linear distortion does not introduce new frequency components to a signal but does alter the balance of existing ones.\n\nThis diagram shows the behaviour of a signal (made up of a [[square wave]] followed by a [[sine wave]]) as it is passed through various distorting functions.\n\n# The first trace (in black) shows the input.  It also shows the output from a non-distorting transfer function (straight line).\n# A [[high-pass filter]] (green trace) distorts the shape of a square wave by reducing its low frequency components.  This is the cause of the \"droop\" seen on the top of the pulses. This \"pulse distortion\" can be very significant when a train of pulses must pass through an AC-coupled (high-pass filtered) amplifier. As the sine wave contains only one frequency, its shape is unaltered.\n# A [[low-pass filter]] (blue trace) rounds the pulses by removing the high frequency components. All systems are low pass to some extent. Note that the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the sine wave is different for the lowpass and the highpass cases, due to the phase distortion of the filters.\n# A slightly [[non-linear]] transfer function (purple), this one gently compresses the peaks of the sine wave, as may be typical of a tube audio amplifier. This generates small amounts of low order harmonics.\n# A hard-[[Clipping (audio)|clipping]] transfer function (red) generates high order harmonics. Parts of the transfer function are flat, which indicates that all information about the input signal has been lost in this region.\n\nThe transfer function of an ideal amplifier, with perfect gain and delay, is only an approximation. The true behavior of the system is usually different. [[Nonlinear]]ities in the transfer function of an [[active device]] (such as [[vacuum tube]]s, [[transistor]]s, and [[operational amplifier]]s) are a common source of non-linear distortion; in passive [[electronic component|components]] (such as a [[coaxial cable]] or [[optical fiber]]), linear distortion can be caused by inhomogeneities, [[Reflection (electrical)|reflections]], and so on in the [[wave propagation|propagation]] path.\n\n===Amplitude distortion===\n{{Main|Amplitude distortion}}\n{{see also|Clipping (signal processing)}}\nAmplitude distortion is distortion occurring in a system, subsystem, or device when the output amplitude is not a linear function of the input amplitude under specified conditions.\n\n===Harmonic distortion===\n\nHarmonic distortion adds [[overtone]]s that are [[Integer|whole number]] multiples of a sound wave's frequencies.<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Moscal\n  | first = Tony\n  | title = Sound Check: The Basics of Sound and Sound Systems\n  | publisher = Hal Leonard \n  | year = 1994\n  | page = 55\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_omgNjqf7GAC&pg=PA55&dq=harmonic+distortion+whole+integer#v=onepage&q&f=false\n  | isbn = }}</ref> Nonlinearities that give rise to amplitude distortion in audio systems are most often measured in terms of the [[harmonic]]s (overtones) added to a pure [[sinewave]] fed to the system. Harmonic distortion may be expressed in terms of the relative strength of individual components, in [[decibel]]s, or the [[root mean square]] of all harmonic components: [[Total harmonic distortion]] (THD), as a percentage. The level at which harmonic distortion becomes  audible depends on the exact nature of the distortion.  Different types of distortion (like [[crossover distortion]]) are more audible than others (like [[soft clipping]]) even if the THD measurements are identical.  Harmonic distortion in [[radio frequency]] applications is rarely expressed as THD.\n\n===Frequency response distortion===\n{{See also|Frequency response}}\nNon-flat frequency response is a form of distortion that occurs when different frequencies are amplified by different amounts in a [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]]. For example, the non-uniform frequency response curve of AC-coupled [[cascade amplifier]] is an example of frequency distortion. In the audio case, this is mainly caused by room acoustics, poor loudspeakers and microphones, long loudspeaker cables in combination with frequency dependent loudspeaker [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], etc.\n\n===Phase distortion===\n{{Main|Phase distortion}}\nThis form of distortion mostly occurs due to [[electrical reactance]]. Here, all the components of the input signal are not amplified with the same phase shift, hence making some parts of the output signal out of phase with the rest of the output.\n\n===Group delay distortion===\nCan be found only in [[dispersion (optics)|dispersive media]]. In a [[waveguide]], [[phase velocity]] varies with frequency. In a filter, group delay tends to peak near the [[cut-off frequency]], resulting in pulse distortion.  When analog long distance trunks were commonplace, for example in [[12 channel carrier]], group delay distortion had to be corrected in [[repeaters]].\n\n==Correction of distortion==\nAs the system output is given by y(t) = F(x(t)), then if the inverse function F<sup>\u22121</sup> can be found, and used intentionally to distort either the input or the output of the system, then the distortion is corrected.\n\nAn example of a similar correction is where LP/[[gramophone record|vinyl]] recordings or [[FM broadcasting|FM audio]] transmissions are deliberately pre-emphasised by a [[linear filter]], the reproducing system applies an inverse filter to make the overall system undistorted.\n\nCorrection is not possible if the inverse does not exist\u2014for instance if the [[transfer function]] has flat spots (the inverse would map multiple input points to a single output point). This produces an uncorrectable loss of information. Such a situation can occur when an amplifier is overdriven\u2014causing [[clipping (audio)|clipping]] or [[slew rate]] distortion when, for a moment, the amplifier characteristics alone and not the input signal determine the output.\n\n===Cancellation of even-order harmonic distortion===\nMany symmetrical [[electronic circuits]] reduce the magnitude of even harmonics generated by the non-linearities of the amplifier's components, by combining two signals from opposite halves of the circuit where distortion components that are roughly the same magnitude but out of phase.  Examples include [[Push\u2013pull output|push-pull amplifiers]] and [[long-tailed pair]]s.\n\n==Teletypewriter or modem signaling==\nIn binary [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signaling]] such as [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]], distortion is the shifting of the significant instants of the signal pulses from their proper positions relative to the beginning of the start [[pulse]]. The magnitude of the distortion is expressed in percent of an ideal unit [[pulse]] length. This is sometimes called 'bias' distortion.\n\nTelegraphic distortion is a similar older problem, distorting the ratio between \"mark\" and \"space\" intervals.  [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3725787.html]\n\n==Distortion in art==\nIn the art world, a distortion is any change made by an artist to the size, shape or visual character of a form to express an idea, convey a feeling or enhance visual impact. Often referred to as \"abstraction,\" examples of distortion include \"[[The Weeping Woman]]\" by Picasso and \"[[The Adoration of the Shepherds (El Greco)|The Adoration of the Shepherds]]\" by El Greco.\n\n==Audio distortion==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[My Bloody Valentine]], [[Loudness war]] and [[Audio distortion]] (redirect) -->\n{{Main|Distortion (music)}}\n[[File:Distortion waveform.svg|thumb|left|A graph of a waveform and the distorted version of the same waveform]]\n{{Listen|filename=Distortion_effect.ogg|title=Distorted waveforms|description=An audio example of a short sample followed by different distorted versions of it.|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nIn this context, distortion refers to any kind of deformation of an output waveform compared to its input, usually [[Clipping (music)|clipping]], [[harmonic distortion]], or [[intermodulation distortion]] ([[Mixing (physics)|mixing]] phenomena) caused by [[non-linear]] behavior of electronic components and power supply limitations.<ref>Audio Electronics by John Linsley Hood; page 162</ref> Terms for specific types of nonlinear audio distortion include: [[crossover distortion]], [[slew-Induced Distortion]] (SID) and [[Intermodulation#Intermodulation in audio applications|transient intermodulation]] (TIM).\n\n[[Distortion (music)|Distortion in music]] is often [[Tube_sound#Intentional_distortion|intentionally used as an effect]] when applied to an [[electric guitar]] signal in styles of [[rock music]] such as [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[punk rock]] (see also [[overdrive (music)|overdrive]] and [[distortion synthesis]]). Other forms of audio distortion that may be referred to are non-flat [[frequency response]], [[audio level compression|compression]], [[modulation]], [[aliasing]], [[quantization noise]], [[wow (recording)|wow]] and [[flutter (electronics and communication)|flutter]] from analog  media such as [[vinyl records]] and [[magnetic tape]]. The human ear cannot hear [[phase distortion]], except that it may affect the [[stereo imaging]]. (See also: [[Audio system measurements]].)\n\nIn most fields, distortion is characterized as unwanted change to a signal.{{clear}}\n\n==Optics==<!-- This section is linked from [[Angle of view]] -->\n{{Main|Distortion (optics)}}\n\nIn [[optics]], image/optical distortion is a divergence from [[rectilinear projection]] caused by a change in [[magnification]] with increasing distance from the [[optical axis]] of an optical system.\n\n==Map projections==\n{{Main|Map projection}}\n\nIn [[cartography]], a distortion is the misrepresentation of the area or shape of a feature. The [[Mercator projection]], for example, distorts by exaggerating the size of regions at high [[latitude]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aliasing]]\n* [[Amplitude distortion]]\n* [[Attenuation distortion]]\n* [[Bias distortion]]\n* [[Crossover distortion]]\n* [[Distortion (music)]]\n* [[Distortion power factor]]\n* [[Fading]]\n* [[Image warping]]\n* [[Intermodulation distortion]]\n* [[Lossy compression]]\n* [[Total harmonic distortion]]\n* [[Tube sound]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{FS1037C MS188}}\n\n{{Noise}}\n{{Analogue TV transmitter topics}}\n\n[[Category:Audio amplifier specifications]]\n[[Category:Audio effects]]\n[[Category:Cartography]]\n[[Category:Optics]]\n[[Category:Effects units]]"}]}}}}
