While celebrated as an innovative use of a new metal, aluminum, the model never lifted off the ground. D'Amecourt's linguistic contribution would survive to eventually describe the vertical flight he had envisioned. Steam power was popular with other inventors as well.

In 1907, those experiments resulted in the ''Gyroplane No.1'', possibly as the earliest known example of a quadcopter.

For this reason, the flights of the Gyroplane No. 1 are considered to be the first manned flight of a helicopter, but not a free or untethered flight.\n\n[[File:HE2G8.jpg|thumb|left|Paul Cornu's helicopter in 1907]]\nThat same year, fellow French inventor [[Paul Cornu]] designed and built a [[Cornu helicopter]] that used two 20-foot (6 m) counter-rotating rotors driven by a 24&nbsp;hp (18&nbsp;kW) [[Antoinette (manufacturer)|Antoinette]] engine.

Young]], American inventor, started work on model helicopters in 1928 using converted electric hover motors to drive the rotor head. Young invented the [[stabilizer bar (helicopter)|stabilizer bar]] and patented it shortly after. A mutual friend introduced Young to Lawrence Dale, who once seeing his work asked him to join the Bell Aircraft company.  When Young arrived at Bell in 1941, he signed his patent over and began work on the helicopter. His budget was US$250,000 to build 2 working helicopters.  In just 6 months they completed the first Bell Model 1, which spawned the [[Bell Model 30]], later succeeded by the Bell 47.<ref>{{cite web | title=American airplanes:Bell | url=http://www.aerofiles.com/_bell.html| date=20 April 2009| publisher=www.aerofiles.com |accessdate=2009-12-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100102011047/http://aerofiles.com/_bell.html| archivedate= 2 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n=== Autogyro ===\n{{main article|Autogyro}}\n[[File:Pitcairn Autogiro NASA GPN-2000-001990.jpg|thumb|[[Pitcairn PCA-2]] autogyro, built in the U.S. under licence to the Cierva Autogiro Company]]\n\nEarly rotor winged flight suffered failures primarily associated with the unbalanced rolling movement generated when attempting take-off, due to [[dissymmetry of lift]] between the advancing and retreating blades. This major difficulty was resolved by [[Juan de la Cierva]]'s introduction of the [[helicopter rotor|flapping hinge]]. In 1923, de la Cierva's first successful [[autogyro]] was flown in Spain by Lt. Gomez Spencer. In 1925 he brought his [[Cierva C.6|C.6]] to Britain and demonstrated it to the [[Air Ministry]] at [[Farnborough, Hampshire]]. This machine had a four blade rotor with flapping hinges but relied upon conventional airplane controls for pitch, roll and yaw. It was based upon an [[Avro 504K]] fuselage, initial rotation of the rotor was achieved by the rapid uncoiling of a rope passed around stops on the undersides of the blades.\n\nA major problem with the autogyro was driving the rotor before takeoff. Several methods were attempted in addition to the coiled rope system, which could take the rotor speed to 50% of that required, at which point movement along the ground to reach flying speed was necessary, while tilting the rotor to establish autorotation. Another approach was to tilt the tail stabiliser to deflect engine slipstream up through the rotor. The most acceptable solution was finally achieved with the [[Cierva C.19|C.19 Mk.4]], which was produced in some quantities; a direct drive from the engine to the rotor was fitted, through which the rotor could be accelerated up to speed. The system was then declutched before the take-off run.\n\nAs de la Cierva's autogyros achieved success and acceptance, others began to follow and with them came further innovation. Most important was the development of direct rotor control through cyclic pitch variation, achieved initially by tilting the rotor hub and subsequently by the Austrian engineer [[Raoul Hafner]], by the application of a spider mechanism that acted directly on each rotor blade. The first production direct control autogyro was the [[Cierva C.30|C.30]], produced in quantity by Avro, [[Liore et Olivier]], and [[Focke-Wulf]].\n\nThe production model, called the C.30A by [[Avro]], was built under licence in Britain, France and Germany and was similar to the C.30P. It carried small movable trimming surfaces. Each licensee used nationally built engines and used slightly different names. In all, 143 production C.30s were built, making it by far the most numerous pre-war autogyro.\n\nBetween 1933 and 1936, de la Cierva used one C.30A (''G-ACWF'') to perfect his last contribution to autogyro development before his death in late 1936.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neam.co.uk/helicopters/cierva.html|title=Former Pages from the North East Aircraft Museum|author=Brian Daugherty|publisher=}}</ref> To enable the aircraft to take off without forward ground travel, he produced the \"Autodynamic\" rotor head, which allowed the rotor to be spun up by the engine in the usual way but to higher than take-off r.p.m at zero rotor incidence and then to reach operational positive pitch suddenly enough to jump some 20&nbsp;ft (6 m) upwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jefflewis.net/autogyros.html|title=Autogyro History and Theory|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Birth of an industry ===\n[[File:R-4 AC HNS1 3 300.jpg|thumb|Igor Sikorsky and the world's first mass-produced helicopter, the [[Sikorsky R-4]], 1944]]\n[[File:Helicopter air mail, 1947 .jpg|thumb|First [[airmail]] service by helicopter in Los Angeles, 1947]]\n\n[[Heinrich Focke]] at Focke-Wulf was licensed to produce the Cierva C.30 [[autogyro]] in 1933. Focke designed the world's first practical [[Helicopter rotor#Transverse|transverse twin-rotor]] helicopter, the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 61]], which first flew on 26 June 1936. The Fw 61 broke all of the helicopter world records in 1937, demonstrating a [[flight envelope]] that had only previously been achieved by the autogyro.\n\nDuring World War II, [[Nazi Germany]] used helicopters in small numbers for observation, transport, and medical evacuation. The [[Flettner Fl 282|Flettner Fl 282 ''Kolibri'']] [[synchropter]]\u2014using the same basic configuration as [[Anton Flettner]]'s own pioneering [[Flettner Fl 265|Fl 265]]\u2014was used in the Mediterranean, while the [[Focke Achgelis Fa 223|Focke Achgelis Fa 223 ''Drache'']] twin-rotor helicopter was used in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  Extensive bombing by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] prevented Germany from producing any helicopters in large quantities during the war.\n\nIn the United States, Russian-born engineer [[Igor Sikorsky]] and W. Lawrence LePage competed to produce the U.S. military's first helicopter. LePage received the [[patent]] rights to develop helicopters patterned after the Fw 61, and built the [[Platt-Le Page XR-1|XR-1]].<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon 1997</ref> Meanwhile, Sikorsky settled on a simpler, single rotor design, the [[VS-300]], which turned out to be the first practical single lifting-rotor helicopter design.  After experimenting with configurations to counteract the torque produced by the single main rotor, Sikorsky settled on a single, smaller rotor mounted on the tailboom.\n\nDeveloped from the VS-300, Sikorsky's [[Sikorsky R-4|R-4]] was the first large-scale mass-produced helicopter, with a production order for 100 aircraft. The R-4 was the only Allied helicopter to serve in World War II, when it was used primarily for [[search and rescue]] (by the [[USAAF]] [[1st Special Operations Wing#1st Air Commando Group|1st Air Commando Group]]) in [[Burma]];<ref>[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/MuseumExhibits/FactSheets/Display/tabid/509/Article/195868/sikorsky-r-4b-hoverfly.aspx Sikorsky R-4B Hoverfly] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203125840/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=518 |date=3 December 2013 }}</ref> in Alaska; and in other areas with harsh terrain. Total production reached 131 helicopters before the R-4 was replaced by other Sikorsky helicopters such as the [[Sikorsky H-5|R-5]] and the [[Sikorsky R-6|R-6]]. In all, Sikorsky produced over 400 helicopters before the end of World War II.<ref name=\"Day\">Day, Dwayne A.

Young|Arthur Young]] to help build a helicopter using Young's two-blade [[teetering rotor]] design, which used a weighted [[stabilizer bar (helicopter)|stabilizer bar]] placed at a 90\u00b0 angle to the rotor blades. The subsequent [[Bell 30|Model 30]] helicopter showed the design's simplicity and ease of use. The Model 30 was developed into the [[Bell 47]], which became the first helicopter certified for civilian use in the United States. Produced in several countries, the Bell 47 was the most popular helicopter model for nearly 30 years.\n\n=== Turbine age ===\n{{see also|Gas turbine|turboshaft}}\n\nIn 1951, at the urging of his contacts at the Department of the Navy, [[Charles Kaman]] modified his [[Kaman K-225|K-225]] [[synchropter]] \u2014 a design for a twin-rotor helicopter concept first pioneered by [[Anton Flettner]] in 1939, with the aforementioned [[Flettner Fl 265|Fl 265]] piston-engined design in Germany \u2014 with a new kind of engine, the [[turboshaft]] engine. This adaptation of the [[gas turbine|turbine engine]] provided a large amount of power to Kaman's helicopter with a lower weight penalty than piston engines, with their heavy engine blocks and auxiliary components. On 11 December 1951, the [[Kaman Aircraft|Kaman]] K-225 became the first turbine-powered helicopter in the world. Two years later, on 26 March 1954, a modified Navy HTK-1, another Kaman helicopter, became the first twin-turbine helicopter to fly.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zt4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA139&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=twghT4yjN4_tggfElaX9CA&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=1954%20Popular%20Mechanics%20January&f=true \"Twin Turborotor Helicopter.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1954, p. 139.</ref> However, it was the [[Sud Aviation]] [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette II|Alouette II]] that would become the first helicopter to be produced with a turbine-engine.<ref name=\"Connor-1\">Connor, R.D. and R.E.

This is largely due to higher engine power density requirements than fixed-wing aircraft. Improvements in fuels and engines during the first half of the 20th century were a critical factor in helicopter development. The availability of lightweight [[turboshaft]] engines in the second half of the 20th century led to the development of larger, faster, and higher-performance helicopters. While smaller and less expensive helicopters still use piston engines, turboshaft engines are the preferred powerplant for helicopters today.\n\n== Uses ==\nDue to the operating characteristics of the helicopter\u2014its ability to take off and land vertically, and to hover for extended periods of time, as well as the aircraft's handling properties under low [[airspeed]] conditions\u2014it has been chosen to conduct tasks that were previously not possible with other aircraft, or were time- or work-intensive to accomplish on the ground.

Aerial cranes are used to place heavy equipment, like radio transmission towers and large air conditioning units, on the tops of tall buildings, or when an item must be raised up in a remote area, such as a radio tower raised on the top of a hill or mountain.

Helibuckets, such as the Bambi bucket, are usually filled by submerging the bucket into lakes, rivers, reservoirs, or portable tanks. Tanks fitted onto helicopters are filled from a hose while the helicopter is on the ground or water is siphoned from lakes or reservoirs through a hanging snorkel as the helicopter hovers over the water source. Helitack helicopters are also used to deliver firefighters, who [[rappel]] down to inaccessible areas, and to resupply firefighters. Common firefighting helicopters include variants of the [[Bell 205]] and the [[Sikorsky S-64|Erickson S-64]] Aircrane helitanker.\n\nHelicopters are used as [[air ambulance]]s for [[Emergency medical services|emergency medical assistance]] in situations when an [[ambulance]] cannot easily or quickly reach the scene, or cannot transport the patient to a medical facility in time. Helicopters are also used when patients need to be transported between medical facilities and air transportation is the most practical method. An air ambulance helicopter is equipped to stabilize and provide limited medical treatment to a patient while in flight. The use of helicopters as air ambulances is often referred to as \"[[MEDEVAC]]\", and patients are referred to as being \"airlifted\", or \"medevaced\". This use was pioneered in the [[Korean war]], when time to reach a medical facility was reduced to three hours from the eight hours needed in [[World War II]], and further reduced to two hours by the [[Vietnam war]].<ref>Kay, Marcia Hillary. \"[http://www.aviationtoday.com/rw/commercial/eng/40-Years-Retrospective-Its-Been-a-Wild-Ride_14518.html 40 Years Retrospective: It's Been a Wild Ride]\" ''Rotor & Wing'', August 2007.

Since helicopters can achieve a unique aerial view, they are often used in conjunction with police on the ground to report on suspects' locations and movements. They are often mounted with lighting and [[Thermographic camera|heat-sensing]] equipment for night pursuits.\n\nMilitary forces use [[attack helicopter]]s to conduct aerial attacks on ground targets. Such helicopters are mounted with [[missile launchers]] and [[minigun]]s. [[Military helicopter|Transport helicopters]] are used to ferry troops and supplies where the lack of an [[airstrip]] would make transport via fixed-wing aircraft impossible. The use of transport helicopters to deliver troops as an attack force on an objective is referred to as \"[[air assault]]\". [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|Unmanned aerial systems]] (UAS) helicopter systems of varying sizes are developed by companies for military [[reconnaissance]] and [[surveillance aircraft|surveillance]] duties. Naval forces also use helicopters equipped with [[Variable depth sonar|dipping sonar]] for [[anti-submarine warfare]], since they can operate from small ships.\n\nOil companies charter helicopters to move workers and parts quickly to remote drilling sites located at sea or in remote locations. The speed advantage over boats makes the high operating cost of helicopters cost-effective in ensuring that [[oil platform]]s continue to operate. Various companies specialize in this type of operation.\n\nOther uses of helicopters include:\n* [[Aerial photography]]\n* [[Motion picture photography]]\n* [[Electronic news gathering]]\n* [[Reflection seismology]]\n* [[Search and rescue]]\n* [[Tourism]] and [[recreation]]\n* [[Transport]]\n\n== Design features ==\n\n=== Rotor system ===\n{{Main article|Helicopter rotor}}\n[[File:Navy-hh1n-158256-070327-16cr-10.jpg|thumb|left|A teetering rotor system with a weighted [[Helicopter rotor#Flybar (stabilizer bar)|flybar]] device]]\n\nThe rotor system, or more simply ''rotor'', is the rotating part of a helicopter that generates [[lift (force)|lift]]. A rotor system may be mounted horizontally, as main rotors are, providing lift vertically, or it may be mounted vertically, such as a tail rotor, to provide horizontal thrust to counteract torque from the main rotors. The rotor consists of a mast, hub and rotor blades.\n\nThe mast is a cylindrical metal shaft that extends upwards from the transmission. At the top of the mast is the attachment point for the rotor blades called the hub. The rotor blades are attached to the hub. Main rotor systems are classified according to how the rotor blades are attached and move relative to the hub. There are three basic types: hingeless, fully articulated, and teetering; although some modern rotor systems use a combination of these.\n\n=== Anti-torque features ===\n[[File:md500n.g-smac.arp.jpg|thumb|MD Helicopters 520N NOTAR]]\n\nMost helicopters have a single main rotor, but torque created as the engine turns the rotor causes the body of the helicopter to turn in the opposite direction to the rotor (by [[conservation of angular momentum]]). To eliminate this effect, some sort of anti-torque control must be used.\n\nThe design that [[Igor Sikorsky]] settled on for his [[Vought-Sikorsky 300|VS-300]] was a smaller tail rotor. The tail rotor pushes or pulls against the tail to counter the torque effect, and this has become the most common configuration for helicopter design.\n\nSome helicopters use other anti-torque controls instead of the tail rotor, such as the [[ducted fan]] (called ''[[Fenestron]]'' or ''FANTAIL'') and [[NOTAR]]. NOTAR provides anti-torque similar to the way a wing develops lift through the use of the [[Coand\u0103 effect]] on the tailboom.<ref name=\"Frawley Civil\">Frawley 2003, p. 151.</ref>\n\n[[File:CH-47 2.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing CH-47 Chinook]] is the most common dual rotor helicopter deployed today]]\nThe use of two or more horizontal rotors turning in opposite directions is another configuration used to counteract the effects of torque on the aircraft without relying on an anti-torque tail rotor. This allows the power normally required to drive the tail rotor to be applied to the main rotors, increasing the aircraft's lifting capacity.  There are several common configurations that use the counter-rotating effect to benefit the rotorcraft:\n* [[Tandem rotors]] are two counter-rotating rotors with one mounted behind the other.\n* [[Coaxial rotors]] are two counter-rotating rotors mounted one above the other with the same axis.\n* [[Intermeshing rotors]] are two counter-rotating rotors mounted close to each other at a sufficient angle to let the rotors intermesh over the top of the aircraft without colliding.\n* Transverse rotors are pair of counter-rotating rotors mounted at each end of the wings or outrigger structures. They are found on [[tiltrotor]]s and some earlier helicopters.\n* [[Quadcopter]]s have four rotors often with parallel axes (sometimes rotating in the same direction with tilted axes) which are commonly used on model aircraft.\n\n[[Tip jet]] designs let the rotor push itself through the air and avoid generating torque.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/helicopters/q0034.shtml |title= Helicopter Yaw Control Methods |work=aerospaceweb.org |accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Engines ===\n[[File:Turbine engine.jpg|thumb|A turbine engine used in the Mi-2 helicopter.]]\n{{Main article|Aircraft engine|Turboshaft}}\n\nThe number, size and type of engine(s) used on a helicopter determines the size, function and capability of that helicopter design. The earliest helicopter engines were simple mechanical devices, such as rubber bands or spindles, which relegated the size of helicopters to toys and small models. For a half century before the first airplane flight, steam engines were used to forward the development of the understanding of helicopter aerodynamics, but the limited power did not allow for manned flight. The introduction of the [[internal combustion engine]] at the end of the 19th century became the watershed for helicopter development as engines began to be developed and produced that were powerful enough to allow for helicopters able to lift humans.{{citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nEarly helicopter designs utilized custom-built engines or [[rotary engine]]s designed for airplanes, but these were soon replaced by more powerful automobile engines and [[radial engines]]. The single, most-limiting factor of helicopter development during the first half of the 20th century was that the amount of power produced by an engine was not able to overcome the engine's weight in vertical flight. This was overcome in early successful helicopters by using the smallest engines available. When the compact, [[flat engine]] was developed, the helicopter industry found a lighter-weight powerplant easily adapted to small helicopters, although radial engines continued to be used for larger helicopters.{{citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nTurbine engines revolutionized the aviation industry, and the turboshaft engine finally gave helicopters an engine with a large amount of power and a low weight penalty. Turboshafts are also more reliable than piston engines, especially when producing the sustained high levels of power required by a helicopter. The turboshaft engine was able to be scaled to the size of the helicopter being designed, so that all but the lightest of helicopter models are powered by turbine engines today.{{citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nSpecial jet engines developed to drive the rotor from the rotor tips are referred to as [[tip jet]]s. Tip jets powered by a remote compressor are referred to as cold tip jets, while those powered by combustion exhaust are referred to as hot tip jets. An example of a cold jet helicopter is the [[Sud-Ouest Djinn]], and an example of the hot tip jet helicopter is the [[YH-32 Hornet]].{{citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nSome [[radio-controlled helicopter]]s and smaller, helicopter-type [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s, use [[electric motor]]s. Radio-controlled helicopters may also have [[piston engine]]s that use fuels other than gasoline, such as [[Nitromethane#Use as an engine fuel|nitromethane]]. Some turbine engines commonly used in helicopters can also use biodiesel instead of jet fuel.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/autos/content/nov2006/bw20061102_790939.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_autos \"Jay Leno's EcoJet Concept.\"] ''businessweek.com,'' 2 November 2006.

These are the cyclic, the collective, the anti-torque pedals, and the throttle. The cyclic control is usually located between the pilot's legs and is commonly called the ''cyclic stick'' or just ''cyclic''. On most helicopters, the cyclic is similar to a joystick. However, the [[Robinson R22]] and [[Robinson R44]] have a unique teetering bar cyclic control system and a few helicopters have a cyclic control that descends into the cockpit from overhead.\n\nThe control is called the cyclic because it changes the [[Blade pitch|pitch]] of the rotor blades cyclically. The result is to tilt the rotor disk in a particular direction, resulting in the helicopter moving in that direction. If the pilot pushes the cyclic forward, the rotor disk tilts forward, and the rotor produces a thrust in the forward direction. If the pilot pushes the cyclic to the side, the rotor disk tilts to that side and produces thrust in that direction, causing the helicopter to hover sideways.\n\nThe collective pitch control or ''collective'' is located on the left side of the pilot's seat with a settable friction control to prevent inadvertent movement. The collective changes the pitch angle of all the main rotor blades collectively (i.e. all at the same time) and independently of their position.  Therefore, if a collective input is made, all the blades change equally, and the result is the helicopter increasing or decreasing in altitude.\n\nThe anti-torque pedals are located in the same position as the [[rudder]] pedals in a fixed-wing aircraft, and serve a similar purpose, namely to control the direction in which the nose of the aircraft is pointed.

''Quote:<sub>The rotor is best served by rotating at a constant rotor speed</sub>''</ref> The throttle controls the power produced by the engine, which is connected to the rotor by a fixed ratio transmission. The purpose of the throttle is to maintain enough engine power to keep the rotor RPM within allowable limits so that the rotor produces enough lift for flight. In single-engine helicopters, the throttle control is a motorcycle-style [[twist grip]] mounted on the collective control, while dual-engine helicopters have a power lever for each engine.\n\nA [[Swashplate (helicopter)|swashplate]] controls the collective and cyclic pitch of the main blades. The swashplate moves up and down, along the main shaft, to change the pitch of both blades. This causes the helicopter to push air downward or upward, depending on the [[angle of attack]]. The swashplate can also change its angle to move the blades angle forwards or backwards, or left and right, to make the helicopter move in those directions.\n\n== Flight ==\n[[File:Svalbard helicotper.ogv|thumb|Helicopter hovering over boat in rescue exercise]]\n\nThere are three basic flight conditions for a helicopter: hover, forward [[flight]] and the transition between the two.\n\n===Hover===\nHovering is the most challenging part of flying a helicopter. This is because a helicopter generates its own gusty air while in a hover, which acts against the [[fuselage]] and flight control surfaces.  The end result is constant control inputs and corrections by the pilot to keep the helicopter where it is required to be.<ref name=lombar>{{cite news |first=Frank |last=Lombardi |url=http://accessintelligence.imirus.com/Mpowered/book/vrw15/i452/p48 |title=Under the big top |page=48 |work=Rotor & Wing |date=April 2015 |accessdate=12 April 2015 }}</ref> Despite the complexity of the task, the control inputs in a hover are simple. The cyclic is used to eliminate drift in the horizontal plane, that is to control forward and back, right and left.  The collective is used to maintain altitude. The pedals are used to control nose direction or [[Course (navigation)|heading]]. It is the interaction of these controls that makes hovering so difficult, since an adjustment in any one control requires an adjustment of the other two, creating a cycle of constant correction.\n\n===Transition from hover to forward flight===\nAs a helicopter moves from hover to forward flight it enters a state called [[translational lift]] which provides extra lift without increasing power.  This state, most typically, occurs when the airspeed reaches approximately 16\u201324 knots, and may be necessary for a helicopter to obtain flight.\n\n===Forward flight===\nIn forward flight a helicopter's flight controls behave more like those of a fixed-wing aircraft.  Displacing the cyclic forward will cause the nose to pitch down, with a resultant increase in airspeed and loss of altitude. Aft cyclic will cause the nose to pitch up, slowing the helicopter and causing it to climb. Increasing collective (power) while maintaining a constant airspeed will induce a climb while decreasing collective will cause a descent. Coordinating these two inputs, down collective plus aft cyclic or up collective plus forward cyclic, will result in airspeed changes while maintaining a constant altitude. The pedals serve the same function in both a helicopter and a fixed-wing aircraft, to maintain balanced flight. This is done by applying a pedal input in whichever direction is necessary to center the ball in the [[turn and bank indicator]].\n\n== Safety ==\n[[File:Indian air force dhruv helicopter j4042 arp.jpg|thumb|[[HAL Dhruv]] at the 2008 [[Royal International Air Tattoo]], England]]\n[[File:Navy squirrel helicopter acrobatics display.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Australian Navy]] [[Eurocopter AS350|Squirrel]] helicopters during a display at the 2008 Melbourne Grand Prix]]\n[[File:Heli Air Robinson R44 Raven II arrives RIAT Fairford 10thJuly2014 arp.jpg|thumb|A [[Robinson R44]] Raven II arrives for the 2014 [[Royal International Air Tattoo]],  England]]\n\n=== Maximum speed limit ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2008}}\n\nThe main limitation of the helicopter is its low speed. There are several reasons a helicopter cannot fly as fast as a fixed-wing aircraft. When the helicopter is hovering, the outer tips of the rotor travel at a speed determined by the length of the blade and the rotational speed. In a moving helicopter, however, the speed of the blades relative to the air depends on the speed of the helicopter as well as on their rotational speed. The airspeed of the advancing rotor blade is much higher than that of the helicopter itself. It is possible for this blade to exceed the [[speed of sound]], and thus produce vastly increased [[wave drag|drag]] and vibration.\n\nAt the same time, the advancing blade creates more lift traveling forward, the retreating blade produces less lift. If the aircraft were to accelerate to the air speed that the blade tips are spinning, the retreating blade passes through air moving at the same speed of the blade and produces no lift at all, resulting in very high torque stresses on the central shaft that can tip down the retreating-blade side of the vehicle, and cause a loss of control. Dual counter-rotating blades prevent this situation due to having two advancing and two retreating blades with balanced forces.\n\nBecause the advancing blade has higher airspeed than the retreating blade and generates a [[dissymmetry of lift]], rotor blades are designed to \"flap\"&nbsp;\u2013 lift and twist in such a way that the advancing blade flaps up and develops a smaller angle of attack. Conversely, the retreating blade flaps down, develops a higher angle of attack, and generates more lift. At high speeds, the force on the rotors is such that they \"flap\" excessively, and the retreating blade can reach too high an angle and stall. For this reason, the maximum safe forward airspeed of a helicopter is given a design rating called [[VNE|V<sub>NE</sub>]], ''velocity, never exceed''.<ref>''Rotorcraft Flying Handbook'' 2007, pp. 3\u20137.</ref> In addition, it is possible for the helicopter to fly at an airspeed where an excessive amount of the retreating blade stalls, which results in high vibration, pitch-up, and roll into the retreating blade.\n\n=== Noise ===\nDuring the closing years of the 20th century designers began working on [[helicopter noise reduction]]. Urban communities have often expressed great dislike of noisy aircraft, and police and passenger helicopters can be unpopular. The redesigns followed the closure of some city [[heliport]]s and government action to constrain flight paths in [[national parks]] and other places of natural beauty.\n\n=== Vibration ===\nHelicopters also vibrate; an unadjusted helicopter can easily vibrate so much that it will shake itself apart. To reduce vibration, all helicopters have rotor adjustments for height and weight. Blade height is adjusted by changing the pitch of the blade. Weight is adjusted by adding or removing weights on the rotor head and/or at the blade end caps. Most also have vibration dampers for height and pitch. Some also use mechanical feedback systems to sense and counter vibration. Usually the feedback system uses a mass as a \"stable reference\" and a linkage from the mass operates a flap to adjust the rotor's [[angle of attack]] to counter the vibration. Adjustment is difficult in part because measurement of the vibration is hard, usually requiring sophisticated accelerometers mounted throughout the airframe and gearboxes. The most common blade vibration adjustment measurement system is to use a stroboscopic flash lamp, and observe painted markings or coloured reflectors on the underside of the rotor blades. The traditional low-tech system is to mount coloured chalk on the rotor tips, and see how they mark a linen sheet. Gearbox vibration most often requires a gearbox overhaul or replacement. Gearbox or drive train vibrations can be extremely harmful to a pilot. The most severe being pain, numbness, loss of tactile discrimination and dexterity.\n\n=== Loss of tail-rotor effectiveness ===\nFor a standard helicopter with a single main rotor, the tips of the main rotor blades produce a vortex ring in the air, which is a spiraling and circularly rotating airflow. As the craft moves forward, these vortices trail off behind the craft.\n\nWhen hovering with a forward diagonal crosswind, or moving in a forward diagonal direction, the spinning vortices trailing off the main rotor blades will align with the rotation of the tail rotor and cause an instability in flight control.<ref>Loss of Tail Rotor Effectiveness, Dynamic Flight Inc. Accessed 2016/05/11 http://www.dynamicflight.com/aerodynamics/loss_tail_eff/</ref>\n\nWhen the trailing vortices colliding with the tail rotor are rotating in the same direction, this causes a loss of thrust from the tail rotor. When the trailing vortices rotate in the opposite direction of the tail rotor, thrust is increased. Use of the foot pedals is required to adjust the tail rotor's angle of attack, to compensate for these instabilities.\n\nThese issues are due to the exposed tail rotor cutting through open air around rear of the vehicle. This issue disappears when the tail is instead ducted, using an internal impeller enclosed in the tail and a jet of high pressure air sideways out of the tail, as the main rotor vortices can not impact the operation of an internal impeller.\n\n=== Critical wind azimuth ===\nFor a standard helicopter with a single main rotor, maintaining steady flight with a crosswind presents an additional flight control problem, where strong crosswinds from certain angles will increase or decrease lift from the main rotors. This effect is also triggered in a no-wind condition when moving the craft diagonally in various directions, depending on the direction of main rotor rotation.<ref>Helicopter pedal turns, LTE and the Critical Wind Azimuth, Helicopter Flight Inc, Accessed 2016/05/11 http://www.helicopterflight.net/pedalturns.php</ref>\n\nThis can lead to a loss of control and a crash or hard landing when operating at low altitudes, due to the sudden unexpected loss of lift, and insufficient time and distance available to recover.\n\n=== Transmission ===\n[[File:Hover OGE 1.JPG|thumbnail|Pascal Chretien hovering the world's first manned electric helicopter, August 2011]]\n\nConventional rotary-wing aircraft use a set of complex mechanical gearboxes to convert the high rotation speed of gas turbines into the low speed required to drive main and tail rotors. Unlike powerplants, mechanical gearboxes cannot be duplicated (for redundancy) and have always been a major weak point in helicopter reliability. In-flight catastrophic gear failures often result in gearbox jamming and subsequent fatalities, whereas loss of lubrication can trigger onboard fire.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Another weakness of mechanical gearboxes is their transient power limitation, due to structural fatigue limits. Recent EASA studies point to engines and transmissions as prime cause of crashes just after pilot errors.<ref>[https://www.easa.europa.eu/communications/docs/annual-safety-review/2011/EASA-Annual-Safety-Review-2011.pdf \"EASA-Annual-Safety-Review-2011\"]</ref>\n\nBy contrast, electromagnetic transmissions do not use any parts in contact; hence lubrication can be drastically simplified, or eliminated. Their inherent redundancy offers good resilience to single point of failure. The absence of gears enables high power transient without impact on service life. The concept of electric propulsion applied to helicopter and electromagnetic drive was brought to reality by [[Pascal Chretien]] who designed, built and flew world's first man-carrying, free-flying electric helicopter. The concept was taken from the conceptual [[computer-aided design]] model on September 10, 2010 to the first testing at 30% power on March 1, 2011 - less than six months. The aircraft first flew on August 12, 2011. All development was conducted in Venelles, France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idtechex.com/events/presentations/challenges-of-aircraft-hybridization-003998.asp |title=Challenges of Aircraft Hybridization |publisher=IDTechEx |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://vtol.org/store/product/vertiflite-marchapril-2012-6058.cfm |title=Vertiflite, March/April 2012 - AHS Online Store |publisher=Vtol.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Hazards ===\nAs with any moving vehicle, unsafe operation could result in loss of control, structural damage, or loss of life. The following is a list of some of the potential hazards for helicopters:\n* [[Settling with power]] is when the aircraft has insufficient power to arrest its descent.  This hazard can develop into Vortex ring state if not corrected early.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\">http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a526709.pdf</ref>\n* [[Vortex ring]] state is a hazard induced by a combination of low airspeed, high power setting, and high descent rate.  Rotor-tip vortices circulate from the high pressure air below the rotor disk to low pressure air above the disk, so that the helicopter settles into its own descending airflow.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> Adding more power increases the rate of air circulation and aggravates the situation.  It is sometimes confused with settling with power, but they are aerodynamically different.\n* [[Retreating blade stall]] is experienced during high speed flight and is the most common limiting factor of a helicopter's forward speed.\n* [[Ground resonance]] is a self-reinforcing vibration that occurs when the lead/lag spacing of the blades of an [[Helicopter rotor#Fully articulated|articulated rotor system]] becomes irregular.\n* [[Low-G condition]] is an abrupt change from a positive G-force state to a negative G-force state that results in loss of lift (unloaded disc) and subsequent roll over. If aft cyclic is applied while the disc is unloaded, the main rotor could strike the tail causing catastrophic failure.<ref>http://www.robinsonheli.com/service_library/safety_notices/rhc_sn11.pdf</ref>\n* [[Dynamic rollover]] in which the helicopter pivots around one of the skids and 'pulls' itself onto its side (almost like a fixed-wing aircraft [[Ground loop (aviation)|ground loop]]).\n* [[Powertrain]] failures, especially those that occur within the shaded area of the [[height-velocity diagram]].\n* Tail rotor failures which occur from either a mechanical malfunction of the tail rotor control system or a loss of tail rotor thrust authority, called \"loss of tail-rotor effectiveness\" (LTE).\n* [[Brownout (aviation)|Brownout]] in dusty conditions or [[whiteout (weather)|whiteout]] in snowy conditions.\n* Low rotor RPM, or \"rotor droop\", is when the engine cannot drive the blades at sufficient RPM to maintain flight.\n* Rotor overspeed, which can over-stress the rotor hub pitch bearings (brinelling) and, if severe enough, cause blade separation from the aircraft.\n* Wire and tree strikes due to low altitude operations and take-offs and landings in remote locations.<ref>[http://www.kauaihelicoptertoursafety.com \"Helicopter Accidents in Hawaii.\"] ''kauaihelicoptertoursafety.com.''
