Fluid mechanics has a wide range of applications, including for [[mechanical engineering]], [[civil engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[geophysics]], [[astrophysics]], and [[biology]]. Fluid mechanics can be divided into [[fluid statics]], the study of fluids at rest; and [[fluid dynamics]], the study of the effect of forces on fluid motion.  It is a branch of [[continuum mechanics]], a subject which models matter without using the information that it is made out of atoms; that is, it models matter from a ''macroscopic'' viewpoint rather than from ''microscopic''. Fluid mechanics, especially fluid dynamics, is an active field of research with many problems that are partly or wholly unsolved.  Fluid mechanics can be mathematically complex, and can best be solved by [[numerical methods]], typically using computers.  A modern discipline, called [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD), is devoted to this approach to solving fluid mechanics problems. [[Particle image velocimetry]], an experimental method for visualizing and analyzing fluid flow, also takes advantage of the highly visual nature of fluid flow.\n\n==Brief history==\n{{main|History of fluid mechanics}}\nThe study of fluid mechanics goes back at least to the days of [[ancient Greece]], when [[Archimedes]] investigated fluid statics and [[buoyancy]] and formulated his famous law known now as the [[Archimedes' principle]], which was published in his work ''[[On Floating Bodies]]'' \u2013 generally considered to be the first major work on fluid mechanics. Rapid advancement in fluid mechanics began with [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (observations and experiments), [[Evangelista Torricelli]] (invented the [[barometer]]), [[Isaac Newton]] (investigated [[viscosity]]) and [[Blaise Pascal]] (researched [[hydrostatics]], formulated [[Pascal's law]]), and was continued by [[Daniel Bernoulli]] with the introduction of mathematical fluid dynamics in ''Hydrodynamica'' (1738).\n\nInviscid flow was further analyzed by various mathematicians ([[Leonhard Euler]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]]) and viscous flow was explored by a multitude of [[engineers]] including [[Jean L\u00e9onard Marie Poiseuille]] and [[Gotthilf Hagen]]. Further mathematical justification was provided by [[Claude-Louis Navier]] and [[George Gabriel Stokes]] in the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]], and [[boundary layers]] were investigated ([[Ludwig Prandtl]], [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]]), while various scientists such as [[Osborne Reynolds]], [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], and [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor]] advanced the understanding of fluid viscosity and [[turbulence]].\n\n==Main branches==\n\n===Fluid statics===\n{{main|Fluid statics}}\n[[Fluid statics]] or '''hydrostatics''' is the branch of fluid mechanics that studies [[fluid]]s at rest.  It embraces the study of the conditions under which fluids are at rest in [[mechanical equilibrium|stable]] [[hydrostatic equilibrium|equilibrium]]; and is contrasted with [[fluid dynamics]], the study of fluids in motion. Hydrostatics offers physical explanations for many phenomena of everyday life, such as why [[atmospheric pressure]] changes with [[altitude]], why wood and oil float on water, and why the surface of water is always flat and horizontal whatever the shape of its container. Hydrostatics is fundamental to [[hydraulics]], the [[engineering]] of equipment for storing, transporting and using fluids.  It is also relevant to some aspect of [[geophysics]] and [[astrophysics]] (for example, in understanding [[plate tectonics]] and anomalies in the [[Gravity of Earth|Earth's gravitational field]]), to [[meteorology]], to [[medicine]] (in the context of [[blood pressure]]), and many other fields.\n\n===Fluid dynamics===\n{{main|Fluid dynamics}}\n[[Fluid dynamics]] is a subdiscipline of fluid mechanics that deals with '''fluid flow'''\u2014the science of liquids and gases in motion.  Fluid dynamics offers a systematic structure\u2014which underlies these [[practical disciplines]]\u2014that embraces empirical and semi-empirical laws derived from [[flow measurement]] and used to solve practical problems.  The solution to a fluid dynamics problem typically involves calculating various properties of the fluid, such as [[velocity]], [[pressure]], [[density]], and [[temperature]], as functions of space and time. It has several subdisciplines itself, including '''[[aerodynamics]]''' (the study of air and other gases in motion) and '''hydrodynamics''' (the study of liquids in motion).  Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including calculating [[force]]s and [[moment (physics)|moment]]s on [[aircraft]], determining the [[mass flow rate]] of [[petroleum]] through pipelines, predicting evolving [[weather]] patterns, understanding [[nebula]]e in [[interstellar space]] and modeling [[explosions]].  Some fluid-dynamical principles are used in [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]] and crowd dynamics.\n\n==Relationship to continuum mechanics==\nFluid mechanics is a subdiscipline of [[continuum mechanics]], as illustrated in the following table.\n{{Continuum mechanics context}}\nIn a mechanical view, a fluid is a substance that does not support [[shear stress]]; that is why a fluid at rest has the shape of its containing vessel.  A fluid at rest has no shear stress.\n\n==Assumptions==\n\n[[File:Reynolds.svg|thumb|right|Balance for some integrated fluid quantity in a [[control volume]] enclosed by a [[control surface (fluid dynamics)|control surface]].]]\nThe assumptions inherent to a fluid mechanical treatment of a physical system  can be expressed in terms of mathematical equations. Fundamentally, every fluid mechanical system is assumed to obey:\n* [[Conservation of mass]]\n* [[Conservation of energy]]\n* [[Conservation of momentum]]\n* The ''continuum assumption''\nFor example, the assumption that mass is conserved means that for any fixed [[control volume]] (for example, a spherical volume) \u2013 enclosed by a [[control surface (fluid dynamics)|control surface]] \u2013 the [[derivative|rate of change]] of the mass contained in that volume is equal to the rate at which mass is passing through the surface from ''outside'' to ''inside'', minus the rate at which mass is passing from ''inside'' to ''outside''. This can be expressed as an [[Continuity equation#Integral form|equation in integral form]] over the control volume.<ref>Batchelor (1967), p. 74.</ref>\n\nThe continuum assumption is an idealization of [[continuum mechanics]] under which fluids can be treated as [[continuous function|continuous]], even though, on a microscopic scale, they are composed of [[molecules]]. Under the continuum assumption, macroscopic (observed/measurable) properties such as density, pressure, temperature, and bulk velocity are taken to be well-defined at \"infinitesimal\" volume elements -- small in comparison to the characteristic length scale of the system, but large in comparison to molecular length scale. Fluid properties can vary continuously from one volume element to another and are average values of the molecular properties. The continuum hypothesis can lead to inaccurate results in applications like supersonic speed flows, or molecular flows on nano scale. Those problems for which the continuum hypothesis fails, can be solved using [[statistical mechanics]].  To determine whether or not the continuum hypothesis applies, the [[Knudsen number]], defined as the ratio of the molecular [[mean free path]] to the characteristic length [[Scale (ratio)|scale]], is evaluated. Problems with Knudsen numbers below 0.1 can be evaluated using continuum hypothesis, but molecular approach (statistical mechanics) can be applied for all ranges of Knudsen numbers.\n\n==Navier\u2013Stokes equations==\n{{main|Navier\u2013Stokes equations}}\nThe '''Navier\u2013Stokes equations''' (named after [[Claude-Louis Navier]] and [[George Gabriel Stokes]]) are [[differential equations]] that describe the force balance at a given point within a fluid. For an [[incompressible fluid]] with vector velocity field <math>\\mathbf{u}</math>, the Navier\u2013Stokes equations are\n\n<math>\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u}  = - \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\nabla P +   \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}</math>,\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{u}</math> is the flow velocity vector. Analogous to Newton's equations of motion, the Navier\u2013Stokes equations describe changes in [[momentum]] ([[force]]) in response to [[pressure]] <math>P </math> and viscosity, parameterized, here, by the [[kinematic viscosity]] <math>\\nu </math>. Occasionally, [[body force]]s, such as the gravitational force or Lorentz force are added to the equations. Solutions of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations for a given physical problem must be sought with the help of [[calculus]]. In practical terms only the simplest case can be solved exactly in this way. These cases generally involve non-turbulent, steady flow in which the [[Reynolds number]] is small. For more complex cases, especially those involving [[turbulence]], such as global weather systems, aerodynamics, hydrodynamics and many more, solutions of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations can currently only be found with the help of computers. This branch of science is called [[computational fluid dynamics]].\n\n==Inviscid and Viscous Fluids==\n\nAn '''inviscid fluid''' has no [[viscosity]], <math>\\nu=0 </math>. In practice, an inviscid flow is an [[ideal fluid|idealization]], one that facilitates mathematical treatment. In fact, purely inviscid flows are only known to be realized in the case of [[superfluidity]]. Otherwise, fluids are generally '''viscous''', a property that is often most important within a [[boundary layer]] near a solid surface,<ref>Kundu, P.K., Cohen, I.M., & Hu, H.H., ''Fluid Mechanics'', Chapter 10, sub-chapter 1</ref> where the flow must match onto the [[no-slip condition]] at the solid. In some cases, the mathematics of a fluid mechanical system can be treated by assuming that the fluid outside of boundary layers is inviscid, and then [[Method of matched asymptotic expansions|matching]] its solution onto that for a thin [[laminar flow|laminar]] boundary layer.\n\nFor fluid flow over a porous boundary, the fluid velocity can be discontinuous between the free fluid and the fluid in the porous media (this is related to the Beavers and Joseph condition). Further, it is useful at low [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] speeds to assume that a gas is [[Incompressible fluid|incompressible]] \u2014 that is, the density of the gas does not change even though the speed and [[static pressure]] change.\n\n==Newtonian versus non-Newtonian fluids==\nA '''Newtonian fluid''' (named after [[Isaac Newton]]) is defined to be a [[fluid]] whose [[shear stress]] is linearly proportional to the [[velocity]] [[gradient]] in the direction [[perpendicular]] to the plane of shear. This definition means regardless of the forces acting on a fluid, it ''continues to flow''. For example, water is a Newtonian fluid, because it continues to display fluid properties no matter how much it is stirred or mixed. A slightly less rigorous definition is that the [[drag (physics)|drag]] of a small object being moved slowly through the fluid is proportional to the force applied to the object. (Compare [[friction]]).  Important fluids, like water as well as most gases, behave \u2013 to good approximation \u2013 as a Newtonian fluid under normal conditions on Earth.<ref name=Batchelor_145>Batchelor (1967), p. 145.</ref>\n\nBy contrast, stirring a [[non-Newtonian fluid]] can leave a \"hole\" behind. This will gradually fill up over time \u2013 this behaviour is seen in materials such as pudding, [[Non-newtonian fluid#Oobleck|oobleck]], or [[sand]] (although sand isn't strictly a fluid). Alternatively, stirring a non-Newtonian fluid can cause the viscosity to decrease, so the fluid appears \"thinner\" (this is seen in non-drip [[paint]]s). There are many types of non-Newtonian fluids, as they are defined to be something that fails to obey a particular property \u2013 for example, most fluids with long molecular chains can react in a non-Newtonian manner.<ref name=Batchelor_145/>\n\n===Equations for a Newtonian fluid===\n{{main|Newtonian fluid}}\nThe constant of proportionality between the viscous stress tensor and the velocity gradient is known as the [[viscosity]]. A simple equation to describe incompressible Newtonian fluid behaviour is\n\n:<math>\\tau=-\\mu\\frac{dv}{dy}</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>\\tau</math> is the shear stress exerted by the fluid (\"[[Drag (physics)|drag]]\")\n:<math>\\mu</math> is the fluid viscosity \u2013 a constant of proportionality\n:<math>\\frac{dv}{dy}</math> is the velocity gradient perpendicular to the direction of shear.\n\nFor a Newtonian fluid, the viscosity, by definition, depends only on [[temperature]] and [[pressure]], not on the forces acting upon it. If the fluid is [[incompressible fluid|incompressible]] the equation governing the viscous stress (in [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]]) is\n\n:<math>\\tau_{ij}=\\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial x_j}+\\frac{\\partial v_j}{\\partial x_i} \\right)</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>\\tau_{ij}</math> is the shear stress on the <math>i^{th}</math> face of a fluid element in the <math>j^{th}</math> direction\n:<math>v_i</math> is the velocity in the <math>i^{th}</math> direction\n:<math>x_j</math> is the <math>j^{th}</math> direction coordinate.\n\nIf the fluid is not incompressible the general form for the viscous stress in a Newtonian fluid is\n\n:<math>\\tau_{ij} = \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial v_j}{\\partial x_i} - \\frac{2}{3} \\delta_{ij} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\right) + \\kappa \\delta_{ij} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} </math>\nwhere <math> \\kappa </math> is the second viscosity coefficient (or bulk viscosity). If a fluid does not obey this relation, it is termed a [[non-Newtonian fluid]], of which there are several types. Non-Newtonian fluids can be either plastic, Bingham plastic, pseudoplastic, dilatant, thixotropic, rheopectic, viscoelastic.\n\nIn some applications another rough broad division among fluids is made: ideal and non-ideal fluids. An Ideal fluid is non-viscous and offers no resistance whatsoever to a shearing force.  An ideal fluid really does not exist, but in some calculations, the assumption is justifiable. One example of this is the flow far from solid surfaces. In many cases the viscous effects are concentrated near the solid boundaries (such as in boundary layers) while in regions of the flow field far away from the boundaries the viscous effects can be neglected and the fluid there is treated as it were inviscid (ideal flow). When the viscosity is negleted, the term containing the viscous stress tensor <math> \\mathbf{\\tau} </math> in the Navier\u2013Stokes equation vanishes. The equation reduced in this form is called the Euler equation.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Physics}}\n*[[Aerodynamics]]\n*[[Applied mechanics]]\n*[[Bernoulli's principle]]\n*[[Communicating vessels]]\n*[[Computational fluid dynamics]]\n*[[Secondary flow]]\n*[[Different types of boundary conditions in fluid dynamics]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{citation | first=George K. | last=Batchelor | authorlink=George Batchelor | title=An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics | year=1967 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0-521-66396-2 }}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{citation | last=Falkovich | first=Gregory | year=2011 | title=Fluid Mechanics (A short course for physicists)|url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item6173728/?site_locale=en_GB | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=978-1-107-00575-4 }}\n* {{citation | last2=Cohen | first2=Ira M. | last1=Kundu | first1=Pijush K. | year=2008 | title=Fluid Mechanics | edition=4th revised | publisher=Academic Press | isbn=978-0-12-373735-9 }}\n*{{Citation\n  | last = Currie\n  | first = I.
