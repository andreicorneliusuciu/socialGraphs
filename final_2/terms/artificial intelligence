In [[computer science]], an ideal \"intelligent\" machine is a flexible [[rational agent]] that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal.<ref name=\"Intelligent agents\"/> Colloquially, the term \"artificial intelligence\" is applied when a machine mimics \"cognitive\" functions that humans associate with other [[human mind]]s, such as \"learning\" and \"problem solving\".{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2009|p=2}} As machines become increasingly capable, mental facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition. For example, [[optical character recognition]] is no longer perceived as an exemplar of \"artificial intelligence\", having become a routine technology.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schank |first=Roger C. |title=Where's the AI |publisher=AI magazine |volume=12 |issue=4 |year=1991|p=38}}</ref> Capabilities currently classified as AI include successfully [[natural language processing|understanding human speech]],{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2009}} competing at a high level in strategic game systems (such as  [[Chess]] and [[Go (game)|Go]]<ref name=bbc-alphago/>), [[self-driving cars]], and interpreting complex data.

Many tools are used in AI, including versions of [[#Search and optimization|search and mathematical optimization]], [[#Logic|logic]], [[#Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning|methods based on probability and economics]]. The AI field draws upon [[computer science]], [[mathematics]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]],  [[neuroscience]] and [[artificial psychology]].\n\n<!-- SUMMARISING FICTION/SPECULATION, PHILOSOPHY, HISTORY -->\nThe field was founded on the claim that [[human intelligence]] \"can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.\"<ref>See the [[Dartmouth conference|Dartmouth proposal]], under [[#Philosophy|Philosophy]], below.</ref> This raises philosophical arguments about the nature of the [[mind]] and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence, issues which have been explored by [[History of AI#AI in myth, fiction and speculation|myth]], [[artificial intelligence in fiction|fiction]] and [[philosophy of AI|philosophy]] since [[ancient history|antiquity]].<ref name=\"McCorduck's thesis\"/> Attempts to create artificial intelligence have experienced many [[AI winter|setbacks]], including the [[AI winter#Machine translation and the ALPAC report of 1966|ALPAC report]] of 1966, the abandonment of [[perceptrons]] in 1970, [[AI winter#The Lighthill report|the Lighthill Report]] of 1973, [[History of artificial intelligence#Bust: the second AI winter 1987\u20131993|the second AI winter 1987\u20131993]] and the [[AI winter#The collapse of the Lisp machine market in 1987|collapse of the Lisp machine market]] in 1987.

MAYBE TO BE KEPT SHORT. -->\nWhile the concept of thought capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity,<ref name=\"AI in myth\"/> the idea of actually trying to build a machine to perform useful reasoning may have begun with [[Ramon Llull]] (c. 1300 CE). With his [[Calculus ratiocinator]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]] extended the concept of the calculating machine ([[Wilhelm Schickard]] engineered the first one around 1623), intending to perform operations on concepts rather than numbers.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2009|p=16}} Since the 19th century, artificial beings are common in fiction, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' or [[Karel \u010capek]]'s ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]''.<!-- PLEASE DON'T ADD MORE EXAMPLES. THIS IS ENOUGH. SEE SECTION AT BOTTOM OF ARTICLE ON SPECULATION.--><ref name=\"AI in early science fiction\"/>\n\n<!-- MAJOR INTELLECTUAL PRECURSORS: LOGIC, THEORY OF COMPUTATION, CYBERNETICS, INFORMATION THEORY, EARLY NEURAL NETS -->\nThe study of mechanical or [[formal reasoning|\"formal\" reasoning]] began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. In the 19th century, [[George Boole]] refined those ideas into [[propositional logic]] and [[Gottlob Frege]] developed a notational system for mechanical reasoning (a ''\"[[predicate calculus]]\"'').{{sfn|Nilsson|1998|loc=Section 1.3}} Around the 1940s, [[Alan Turing]]'s [[theory of computation]] suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This insight, that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known as the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis]].<ref name=\"Formal reasoning\"/> Along with concurrent discoveries in [[neurology]], [[information theory]] and [[cybernetic]]s, this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain.<ref name=\"AI's immediate precursors\"/> The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was [[Warren McCullouch|McCullouch]] and [[Walter Pitts|Pitts]]' 1943 formal design for [[Turing-complete]] \"artificial neurons\".{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2009|p=16}}\n\n<!-- THE \"GOLDEN YEARS\" 1956-1974 -->\nThe field of AI research was founded at [[Dartmouth Conferences|a conference]] at [[Dartmouth College]] in 1956.<ref name=\"Dartmouth conference\"/> The attendees, including [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Allen Newell]], [[Arthur Samuel]] and [[Herbert A.

[[Marvin Minsky]] agreed, writing that \"within a generation&nbsp;... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved\".<ref name=\"Optimism of early AI\"/>\n\n<!-- FIRST AI WINTER -->\nThey failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks. Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism of [[Sir James Lighthill]]{{sfn|Lighthill|1973}} and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in AI. The next few years would later be called an \"[[AI winter]]\",<ref name=\"First AI winter\"/> a period when funding for AI projects was hard to find.\n\n<!-- BOOM OF THE 1980s, SECOND AI WINTER -->\nIn the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of [[expert system]]s,<ref name=\"Expert systems\"/> a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985 the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's [[fifth generation computer]] project inspired the U.S and British governments to restore funding for academic research.<ref name=\"AI in the 80s\"/> However, beginning with the collapse of the [[Lisp Machine]] market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting hiatus began.<ref name=\"Second AI winter\"/>\n\n<!-- FORMAL METHODS RISING IN THE 90s -->\nIn the late 1990s and early 21st century, AI began to be used for logistics, [[data mining]], [[medical diagnosis]] and other areas.<ref name=\"AI widely used\"/> The success was due to increasing computational power (see [[Moore's law]]), greater emphasis on solving specific problems, new ties between AI and other fields and a commitment by researchers to mathematical methods and scientific standards.<ref name=\"Formal methods in AI\"/> [[IBM Deep Blue|Deep Blue]] became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, [[Garry Kasparov]] on 11 May 1997.{{sfn|McCorduck|2004|pp=480\u2013483}}\n\n<!--DEEP LEARNING, BIG DATA & MACHINE LEARNING IN THE 2010's -->\nAdvanced statistical techniques (loosely known as [[deep learning]]), access to [[big data|large amounts of data]] and [[Moore's law|faster computers]] enabled advances in [[machine learning]] and perception.<ref name=\"deep learning\"/> By the mid 2010s, machine learning applications were used  throughout the world.<ref name=\"success in 21st century\"/> In a ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' [[quiz show]] exhibition match, [[IBM]]'s [[question answering system]], [[Watson (artificial intelligence software)|Watson]], defeated the two greatest Jeopardy champions, [[Brad Rutter]] and [[Ken Jennings]], by a significant margin.{{sfn|Markoff|2011}} The [[Kinect]], which provides a 3D body\u2013motion interface for the [[Xbox 360]] and the Xbox One use algorithms that emerged from lengthy AI research<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.i-programmer.info/news/105-artificial-intelligence/2176-kinects-ai-breakthrough-explained.html|title=Kinect's AI breakthrough explained|author=Administrator|work=i-programmer.info}}</ref> as do [[intelligent personal assistant]]s in [[smartphone]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://readwrite.com/2013/01/15/virtual-personal-assistants-the-future-of-your-smartphone-infographic|title=Virtual Personal Assistants & The Future Of Your Smartphone [Infographic]|date=15 January 2013|author=Rowinski, Dan|work=ReadWrite}}</ref> In March 2016, [[AlphaGo]] won 4 out of 5 games of [[Go (game)|Go]] in a match with Go champion [[Lee Sedol]], becoming the first [[Computer Go|computer Go-playing system]] to beat a professional Go player without [[Go handicaps|handicaps]].<ref name=bbc-alphago>{{cite web|url=https://deepmind.com/alpha-go.html|title=AlphaGo - Google DeepMind|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Artificial intelligence: Google's AlphaGo beats Go master Lee Se-dol|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35785875|accessdate=1 October 2016|work=BBC News|date=12 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== 2015: A landmark year ===\nAccording to [[Bloomberg_News|Bloomberg's]] Jack Clark, 2015 has been a landmark year for artificial intelligence, with the number of software projects that use AI within Google increasing from a \"sporadic usage\" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects.

These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.<ref name=\"Problems of AI\"/>\n\n==== Deduction, reasoning, problem solving ====\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction --><!-- SOLVED PROBLEMS -->\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions (reason).<ref name=\"Reasoning\"/> By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed methods for dealing with [[uncertainty|uncertain]] or incomplete information, employing concepts from [[probability]] and [[economics]].<ref name=\"Uncertain reasoning\"/>\n\n<!-- TWO IMPORTANT UNSOLVED PROBLEMS -->\nFor difficult problems, algorithms can require enormous computational resources&mdash;most experience a \"[[combinatorial explosion]]\": the amount of memory or computer time required becomes astronomical for problems of a certain size. The search for more efficient problem-solving algorithms is a high priority.<ref name=\"Intractability\"/>\n\nHuman beings ordinarily use fast, intuitive judgments rather than step-by-step deduction that early AI research was able to model.<ref name=\"Psychological evidence of sub-symbolic reasoning\"/> AI has progressed using \"sub-symbolic\" problem solving: [[embodied agent]] approaches emphasize the importance of [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] skills to higher reasoning; [[neural net]] research attempts to simulate the structures inside the brain that give rise to this skill; [[#Statistical|statistical approaches to AI]] mimic the human ability to guess.\n\n==== Knowledge representation ====\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n[[File:GFO taxonomy tree.png|right|thumb|An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.]]\n{{Main article|Knowledge representation|Commonsense knowledge}}\n\n[[Knowledge representation]]<ref name=\"Knowledge representation\"/> and [[knowledge engineering]]<ref name=\"Knowledge engineering\"/> are central to AI research. Many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things that AI needs to represent are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;<ref name=\"Representing categories and relations\"/> situations, events, states and time;<ref name=\"Representing time\"/> causes and effects;<ref name=\"Representing causation\"/> knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);<ref name=\"Representing knowledge about knowledge\"/> and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of \"what exists\" is an [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]]: the set of objects, relations, concepts and so on that the machine knows about. The most general are called [[upper ontology|upper ontologies]], which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge.<ref name=\"Ontology\"/>\n\nAmong the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are:\n\n;[[Default reasoning]] and the [[qualification problem]]: Many of the things people know take the form of \"working assumptions.\" For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist sized, sings, and flies. None of these things are true about all birds. [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] identified this problem in 1969<ref name=\"Qualification problem\"/> as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.<ref name=\"Default reasoning and non-monotonic logic\"/>\n\n;The breadth of commonsense knowledge: The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is astronomical. Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of [[commonsense knowledge]] (e.g., [[Cyc]]) require enormous amounts of laborious [[ontology engineering|ontological engineering]]\u2014they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time.<ref name=\"Breadth of commonsense knowledge\"/> A major goal is to have the computer understand enough concepts to be able to learn by reading from sources like the Internet, and thus be able to add to its own ontology.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n;The subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge: Much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally. For example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it \"feels too exposed\"{{sfn|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}} or an art critic can take one look at a statue and instantly realize that it is a fake.{{sfn|Gladwell|2005}} These are intuitions or tendencies that are represented in the brain non-consciously and sub-symbolically.<ref name=\"Intuition\"/> Knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge. As with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that [[situated artificial intelligence|situated AI]], [[computational intelligence]], or [[#Statistical|statistical AI]] will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge.<ref name=\"Intuition\"/>\n\n==== Planning ====\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n[[File:Hierarchical-control-system.svg|thumb| A [[hierarchical control system]] is a form of [[control system]] in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchy.]]\n\n{{Main article|Automated planning and scheduling}}\n\nIntelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them.<ref name=\"Planning\"/> They need a way to visualize the future (they must have a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it) and be able to make choices that maximize the [[utility]] (or \"value\") of the available choices.<ref name=\"Information value theory\"/>\n\nIn classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only thing acting on the world and it can be certain what the consequences of its actions may be.<ref name=\"Classical planning\"/> However, if the agent is not the only actor, it must periodically ascertain whether the world matches its predictions and it must change its plan as this becomes necessary, requiring the agent to reason under uncertainty.<ref name=\"Non-deterministic planning\"/>\n\n[[Multi-agent planning]] uses the [[cooperation]] and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal. [[Emergent behavior]] such as this is used by [[evolutionary algorithms]] and [[swarm intelligence]].<ref name=\"Multi-agent planning\"/>\n\n==== Learning ====\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main article|Machine learning}}\n\nMachine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience<ref>This is a form of [[Tom M. Mitchell|Tom Mitchell]]'s widely quoted definition of machine learning: \"A computer program is set to learn from an experience ''E'' with respect to some task ''T'' and some performance measure ''P'' if its performance on ''T'' as measured by ''P'' improves with experience ''E''.\"</ref><ref name=\"Machine learning\"/> and has been central to AI research since the field's inception.<ref>\n[[Alan Turing]] discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper \"[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]\".{{Harv|Turing|1950}} In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference, [[Ray Solomonoff]] wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: \"An Inductive Inference Machine\".{{Harv|Solomonoff|1956}}</ref>\n\n[[Unsupervised learning]] is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input. [[Supervised learning]] includes both [[statistical classification|classification]] and numerical [[Regression analysis|regression]]. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change. In [[reinforcement learning]]<ref name=\"Reinforcement learning\"/> the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem space. These three types of learning can be analyzed in terms of [[decision theory]], using concepts like [[utility (economics)|utility]]. The mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of [[theoretical computer science]] known as [[computational learning theory]].<ref name=\"Computational learning theory\"/>\n\nWithin [[developmental robotics]], developmental learning approaches were elaborated for lifelong cumulative acquisition of repertoires of novel skills by a robot, through autonomous self-exploration and social interaction with human teachers, and using guidance mechanisms such as active learning, maturation, motor synergies, and imitation.{{sfn|Weng|McClelland|Pentland|Sporns|2001}}{{sfn|Lungarella|Metta|Pfeifer|Sandini|2003}}{{sfn|Asada|Hosoda|Kuniyoshi|Ishiguro|2009}}{{sfn|Oudeyer|2010}}\n\n==== Natural language processing (communication) ====\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n[[File:ParseTree.svg|thumb| A [[parse tree]] represents the [[syntax|syntactic]] structure of a sentence according to some [[formal grammar]].]]\n{{Main article|Natural language processing}}\n\n[[Natural language processing]]<ref name=\"Natural language processing\"/> gives machines the ability to read and [[natural language understanding|understand]] the languages that humans speak. A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable [[natural language user interface]]s and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include [[information retrieval]], [[text mining]], [[question answering]]<ref>\"[https://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis Versatile question answering systems: seeing in synthesis]\", Mittal et al., IJIIDS, 5(2), 119-142, 2011\n</ref> and [[machine translation]].<ref name=\"Applications of natural language processing\"/>\n\nA common method of processing and extracting meaning from natural language is through semantic indexing. Increases in processing speeds and the drop in the cost of data storage makes indexing large volumes of abstractions of the user's input much more efficient.\n\n==== Perception ====\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main article|Machine perception|Computer vision|Speech recognition}}\n\n[[Machine perception]]<ref name=\"Machine perception\"/> is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, [[tactile sensor]]s, sonar and others more exotic) to deduce aspects of the world. [[Computer vision]]<ref name=\"Computer vision\"/> is the ability to analyze visual input. A few selected subproblems are [[speech recognition]],<ref name=\"Speech recognition\"/> [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]] and [[object recognition]].<ref name=\"Object recognition\"/>\n\n==== Motion and manipulation ====\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main article|Robotics}}\n\nThe field of [[robotics]]<ref name=\"Robotics\"/> is closely related to AI. Intelligence is required for robots to be able to handle such tasks as object manipulation<ref name=\"Configuration space\"/> and [[motion planning|navigation]], with sub-problems of [[Robot localization|localization]] (knowing where you are, or finding out where other things are), [[robotic mapping|mapping]] (learning what is around you, building a map of the environment), and [[motion planning]] (figuring out how to get there) or path planning (going from one point in space to another point, which may involve compliant motion \u2013 where the robot moves while maintaining physical contact with an object).{{sfn|Tecuci|2012}}<ref name=\"Robotic mapping\"/>\n\n==== Long-term goals ====\nAmong the long-term goals in the research pertaining to artificial intelligence are: (1) Social intelligence, (2) Creativity, and (3) General intelligence.\n\n===== Social intelligence =====\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main article|Affective computing}}\n[[File:Kismet robot at MIT Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Kismet (robot)|Kismet]], a robot with rudimentary social skills{{sfn|''Kismet''}}]]\n\nAffective computing is the study and development of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human [[Affect (psychology)|affects]].{{sfn|Thro|1993}}{{sfn|Edelson|1991}} It is an interdisciplinary field spanning [[computer sciences]], [[psychology]], and [[cognitive science]].{{sfn|Tao|Tan|2005}} While the origins of the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical inquiries into [[Emotion#The James-Lange Theory|emotion]],{{sfn|James|1884}} the more modern branch of computer science originated with [[Rosalind Picard]]'s 1995 paper{{sfn|Picard|1995}} on affective computing.<ref>{{harvnb|Kleine-Cosack|2006}}: \"The introduction of emotion to computer science was done by Pickard (sic) who created the field of affective computing.\"</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Diamond|2003}}: \"Rosalind Picard, a genial MIT professor, is the field's godmother; her 1997 book, Affective Computing, triggered an explosion of interest in the emotional side of computers and their users.\"</ref> A motivation for the research is the ability to simulate [[empathy]]. The machine should interpret the emotional state of humans and adapt its behaviour to them, giving an appropriate response for those emotions.\n\nEmotion and social skills<ref name=\"Emotion and affective computing\"/> play two roles for an intelligent agent. First, it must be able to predict the actions of others, by understanding their motives and emotional states. (This involves elements of [[game theory]], [[decision theory]], as well as the ability to model human emotions and the perceptual skills to detect emotions.) Also, in an effort to facilitate [[human-computer interaction]], an intelligent machine might want to be able to ''display'' emotions\u2014even if it does not actually experience them itself\u2014in order to appear sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction.\n\n===== Creativity =====\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main article|Computational creativity}}\n\nA sub-field of AI addresses [[creativity]] both theoretically (from a philosophical and psychological perspective) and practically (via specific implementations of systems that generate outputs that can be considered creative, or systems that identify and assess creativity). Related areas of computational research are [[Artificial intuition]] and Artificial thinking.\n\n===== General intelligence =====\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main article|Artificial general intelligence|AI-complete}}\n\nMany researchers think that their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with ''general'' intelligence (known as [[artificial general intelligence|strong AI]]), combining all the skills above and exceeding human abilities at most or all of them.<ref name=\"General intelligence\"/> A few believe that [[anthropomorphic]] features like [[artificial consciousness]] or an [[artificial brain]] may be required for such a project.<ref name=\"Artificial consciousness\"/><ref name=\"Brain simulation\"/>\n\nMany of the problems above may require general intelligence to be considered solved. For example, even a straightforward, specific task like [[machine translation]] requires that the machine read and write in both languages ([[#Natural language processing|NLP]]), follow the author's argument ([[#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|reason]]), know what is being talked about ([[#Knowledge representation|knowledge]]), and faithfully reproduce the author's intention ([[#Social intelligence|social intelligence]]). A problem like [[machine translation]] is considered \"[[AI-complete]]\". In order to solve this particular problem, one must solve all the problems.<ref name=\"AI complete\"/>\n\n=== Approaches ===\nThere is no established unifying theory or [[paradigm]] that guides AI research. Researchers disagree about many issues.<ref>[[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] writes: \"Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about\" {{Harv|Nilsson|1983|p=10}}.</ref> A few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these: should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying [[psychology]] or [[neurology]]? Or is [[human biology]] as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is to [[aeronautical engineering]]?<ref name=\"Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general\"/>\nCan intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles (such as [[logic]] or [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]])? Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?<ref name=\"Neats vs. scruffies\"/>\nCan intelligence be reproduced using high-level symbols, similar to words and ideas? Or does it require \"sub-symbolic\" processing?<ref name=\"Symbolic vs. sub-symbolic\"/>\nJohn Haugeland, who coined the term GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence), also proposed that AI should more properly be referred to as [[synthetic intelligence]],{{sfn|Haugeland|1985|p=255}} a term which has since been adopted by some non-GOFAI researchers.{{sfn|Law|1994}}{{sfn|Bach|2008}}\n\n==== Cybernetics and brain simulation ====\n{{Main article|Cybernetics|Computational neuroscience}}\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between [[neurology]], [[information theory]], and [[cybernetics]]. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as [[W. Grey Walter]]'s [[turtle (robot)|turtles]] and the [[Johns Hopkins Beast]]. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at [[Princeton University]] and the [[Ratio Club]] in England.<ref name=\"AI's immediate precursors\"/> By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.\n\n==== Symbolic ====\n{{Main article|Symbolic AI}}\nWhen access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was centered in three institutions: [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Stanford]] and [[MIT]], and each one developed its own style of research. [[John Haugeland]] named these approaches to AI \"good old fashioned AI\" or \"[[GOFAI]]\".<ref name=\"GOFAI\"/> During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level thinking in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on [[cybernetics]] or [[neural network]]s were abandoned or pushed into the background.<ref>The most dramatic case of sub-symbolic AI being pushed into the background was the devastating critique of [[perceptron]]s by [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]] in 1969. See [[History of AI]], [[AI winter]], or [[Frank Rosenblatt]].</ref>\nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with [[artificial general intelligence]] and considered this the goal of their field.\n\n; Cognitive simulation: Economist [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] and [[Allen Newell]] studied human problem-solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as [[cognitive science]], [[operations research]] and [[management science]]. Their research team used the results of [[psychology|psychological]] experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems. This tradition, centered at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] would eventually culminate in the development of the [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]] architecture in the middle 1980s.<ref name=\"AI at CMU in the 60s\"/><ref name=\"Soar\"/>\n\n; Logic-based: Unlike [[Allen Newell|Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]], [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem solving, regardless of whether people used the same algorithms.<ref name=\"Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general\"/> His laboratory at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] ([[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|SAIL]]) focused on using formal [[logic]] to solve a wide variety of problems, including [[knowledge representation]], [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]] and [[machine learning|learning]].<ref name=\"AI at Stanford in the 60s\"/> Logic was also the focus of the work at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language [[Prolog]] and the science of [[logic programming]].<ref name=\"AI at Edinburgh and France in the 60s\"/>\n\n; \"Anti-logic\" or \"scruffy\": Researchers at [[MIT]] (such as [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]])<ref name=\"AI at MIT in the 60s\"/> found that solving difficult problems in [[computer vision|vision]] and [[natural language processing]] required ad-hoc solutions \u2013 they argued that there was no simple and general principle (like [[logic]]) that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior. [[Roger Schank]] described their \"anti-logic\" approaches as \"[[Neats vs. scruffies|scruffy]]\" (as opposed to the \"[[neats vs. scruffies|neat]]\" paradigms at [[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]] and [[Stanford]]).<ref name=\"Neats vs. scruffies\"/> [[Commonsense knowledge bases]] (such as [[Doug Lenat]]'s [[Cyc]]) are an example of \"scruffy\" AI, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time.<ref name=\"Cyc\"/>\n\n; Knowledge-based: When computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build [[knowledge representation|knowledge]] into AI applications.<ref name=\"Knowledge revolution\"/> This \"knowledge revolution\" led to the development and deployment of [[expert system]]s (introduced by [[Edward Feigenbaum]]), the first truly successful form of AI software.<ref name=\"Expert systems\"/> The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications.\n\n==== Sub-symbolic ====\nBy the 1980s progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially [[machine perception|perception]], [[robotics]], [[machine learning|learning]] and [[pattern recognition]]. A number of researchers began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches to specific AI problems.<ref name=\"Symbolic vs. sub-symbolic\"/>  Sub-symbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without specific representations of knowledge.\n\n; Bottom-up, [[embodied agent|embodied]], [[situated]], [[behavior-based AI|behavior-based]] or [[nouvelle AI]]: Researchers from the related field of [[robotics]], such as [[Rodney Brooks]], rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive.<ref name=\"Embodied AI\"/> Their work revived the non-symbolic viewpoint of the early [[cybernetic]]s researchers of the 1950s and reintroduced the use of [[control theory]] in AI. This coincided with the development of the [[embodied mind thesis]] in the related field of [[cognitive science]]: the idea that aspects of the body (such as movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence.\n\n; [[Computational intelligence]] and [[soft computing]]: Interest in [[neural networks]] and \"[[connectionism]]\" was revived by [[David Rumelhart]] and others in the middle of 1980s.<ref name=\"Revival of connectionism\"/> Neural networks are an example of [[soft computing]] --- they are solutions to problems which cannot be solved with complete logical certainty, and where an approximate solution is often enough. Other soft computing approaches to AI include [[fuzzy system]]s, [[evolutionary computation]] and many statistical tools. The application of soft computing to AI is studied collectively by the emerging discipline of [[computational intelligence]].<ref name=\"Computational intelligence\"/>\n\n==== Statistical ====\nIn the 1990s, AI researchers developed sophisticated mathematical tools to solve specific subproblems. These tools are truly [[scientific method|scientific]], in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable, and they have been responsible for many of AI's recent successes. The shared mathematical language has also permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like [[mathematics]], economics or [[operations research]]). [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig]] describe this movement as nothing less than a \"revolution\" and \"the victory of the [[neats and scruffies|neats]].\"<ref name=\"Formal methods in AI\"/> Critics argue that these techniques (with few exceptions{{sfn|Hutter|2012}}) are too focused on particular problems and have failed to address the long-term goal of general intelligence.{{sfn|Langley|2011}} There is an ongoing debate about the relevance and validity of statistical approaches in AI, exemplified in part by exchanges between [[Peter Norvig]] and [[Noam Chomsky]].{{sfn|Katz|2012}}{{sfn|Norvig|2012}}\n\n==== Integrating the approaches ====\n;Intelligent agent paradigm: An [[intelligent agent]] is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings (such as [[firm]]s). The paradigm gives researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that are both verifiable and useful, without agreeing on one single approach. An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works \u2013 some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic [[neural network]]s and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields\u2014such as [[decision theory]] and economics\u2014that also use concepts of abstract agents. The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.<ref name=\"Intelligent agents\"/>\n\n;[[Agent architecture]]s and [[cognitive architecture]]s: Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting [[intelligent agents]] in a [[multi-agent system]].<ref name=\"Agent architectures\"/> A system with both symbolic and sub-symbolic components is a [[hybrid intelligent system]], and the study of such systems is [[artificial intelligence systems integration]]. A [[hierarchical control system]] provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling.<ref name=\"Hierarchical control system\"/> [[Rodney Brooks]]' [[subsumption architecture]] was an early proposal for such a hierarchical system.<ref name=\"Subsumption architecture\"/>\n<!--\nThis should also describe [[Soar (cognitive architecture)]] briefly.\n--->\n\n=== Tools ===\nIn the course of 50 years of research, AI has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in [[computer science]]. A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below.\n\n==== Search and optimization ====\n{{Main article|Search algorithm|Mathematical optimization|Evolutionary computation}}\n\nMany problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:<ref name=\"Search\"/> [[#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|Reasoning]] can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from [[premise]]s to [[Logical consequence|conclusions]], where each step is the application of an [[inference rule]].<ref name=\"Logic as search\"/> [[Automated planning and scheduling|Planning]] algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called [[means-ends analysis]].<ref name=\"Planning as search\"/> [[Robotics]] algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use [[local search (optimization)|local searches]] in [[configuration space]].<ref name=\"Configuration space\" /> Many [[machine learning|learning]] algorithms use search algorithms based on [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]].\n\nSimple exhaustive searches<ref name=\"Uninformed search\"/> are rarely sufficient for most real world problems: the [[search algorithm|search space]] (the number of places to search) quickly grows to [[Large numbers#Astronomically large numbers|astronomical numbers]]. The result is a search that is [[Computation time|too slow]] or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use \"[[heuristics]]\" or \"rules of thumb\" that eliminate choices that are unlikely to lead to the goal (called \"[[pruning (algorithm)|pruning]] the [[search tree]]\"). [[Heuristics]] supply the program with a \"best guess\" for the path on which the solution lies.<ref name=\"Informed search\"/> Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.{{sfn|Tecuci|2012}}\n\nA very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind [[hill climbing]]: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are [[simulated annealing]], [[beam search]] and [[random optimization]].<ref name=\"Optimization search\"/>\n\n[[Evolutionary computation]] uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, [[natural selection|selecting]] only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Forms of [[evolutionary computation]] include [[swarm intelligence]] algorithms (such as [[ant colony optimization|ant colony]] or [[particle swarm optimization]])<ref name=\"Society based learning\"/> and [[evolutionary algorithms]] (such as [[genetic algorithms]], [[gene expression programming]], and [[genetic programming]]).<ref name=\"Genetic programming\"/>\n\n==== Logic ====\n{{Main article|Logic programming|Automated reasoning}}\n\n[[Logic]]<ref name=\"Logic\"/> is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the [[satplan]] algorithm uses logic for [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]]<ref name=\"Satplan\"/> and [[inductive logic programming]] is a method for [[machine learning|learning]].<ref name=\"Symbolic learning techniques\"/>\n\nSeveral different forms of logic are used in AI research. [[Propositional logic|Propositional]] or [[sentential logic]]<ref name=\"Propositional logic\"/> is the logic of statements which can be true or false. [[First-order logic]]<ref name=\"First-order logic\"/> also allows the use of [[quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]] and [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]], and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. [[Fuzzy logic]],<ref name=\"Fuzzy logic\"/> is a version of first-order logic which allows the truth of a statement to be represented as a value between 0 and 1, rather than simply True (1) or False (0). [[Fuzzy system]]s can be used for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer [[Pattern recognition|product control systems]]. [[Subjective logic]]<ref name=\"Subjective logic\"/> models uncertainty in a different and more explicit manner than fuzzy-logic: a given binomial opinion satisfies belief + disbelief + uncertainty = 1 within a [[Beta distribution]]. By this method, ignorance can be distinguished from probabilistic statements that an agent makes with high confidence.\n\n[[Default logic]]s, [[non-monotonic logic]]s and [[circumscription (logic)|circumscription]]<ref name=\"Default reasoning and non-monotonic logic\"/> are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the [[qualification problem]]. Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of [[knowledge representation|knowledge]], such as: [[description logic]]s;<ref name=\"Representing categories and relations\"/> [[situation calculus]], [[event calculus]] and [[fluent calculus]] (for representing events and time);<ref name=\"Representing time\"/> [[Causality#Causal calculus|causal calculus]];<ref name=\"Representing causation\"/> belief calculus;<ref>\"The Belief Calculus and Uncertain Reasoning\", Yen-Teh Hsia</ref> and [[modal logic]]s.<ref name=\"Representing knowledge about knowledge\"/>\n\n==== Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning ====\n{{Main article|Bayesian network|Hidden Markov model|Kalman filter|Decision theory|Utility theory}}\n\nMany problems in AI (in reasoning, planning, learning, perception and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from [[probability]] theory and economics.<ref name=\"Stochastic methods for uncertain reasoning\"/>\n\n[[Bayesian network]]s<ref name=\"Bayesian networks\"/> are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems: reasoning (using the [[Bayesian inference]] algorithm),<ref name=\"Bayesian inference\"/> [[Machine learning|learning]] (using the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]]),<ref name=\"Bayesian learning\"/> [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]] (using [[decision network]]s)<ref name=\"Bayesian decision networks\"/> and [[machine perception|perception]] (using [[dynamic Bayesian network]]s).<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/> Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping [[machine perception|perception]] systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., [[hidden Markov model]]s or [[Kalman filter]]s).<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/>\n\nA key concept from the science of economics is \"[[utility]]\": a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using [[decision theory]], [[decision analysis]],<ref name=\"Decisions theory and analysis\"/> and [[applied information economics|information value theory]].<ref name=\"Information value theory\"/> These tools include models such as [[Markov decision process]]es,<ref name=\"Markov decision process\"/> dynamic [[decision network]]s,<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\" /> [[game theory]] and [[mechanism design]].<ref name=\"Game theory and mechanism design\"/>\n\n==== Classifiers and statistical learning methods ====\n{{Main article|Classifier (mathematics)|Statistical classification|Machine learning}}\n\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (\"if shiny then diamond\") and controllers (\"if shiny then pick up\"). Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. [[Classifier (mathematics)|Classifiers]] are functions that use [[pattern matching]] to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.<ref name=\"Classifiers\"/>\n\nA classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and [[machine learning]] approaches. The most widely used classifiers are the [[Artificial neural network|neural network]],<ref name=\"Neural networks\" />\n[[kernel methods]] such as the [[support vector machine]],<ref name=\"Kernel methods\"/>\n[[k-nearest neighbor algorithm]],<ref name=\"K-nearest neighbor algorithm\"/>\n[[Gaussian mixture model]],<ref name=\"Gaussian mixture model\"/>\n[[naive Bayes classifier]],<ref name=\"Naive Bayes classifier\"/>\nand [[decision tree learning|decision tree]].<ref name=\"Decision tree\"/>\nThe performance of these classifiers have been compared over a wide range of tasks. Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified. There is no single classifier that works best on all given problems; this is also referred to as the \"[[No free lunch in search and optimization|no free lunch]]\" theorem. Determining a suitable classifier for a given problem is still more an art than science.<ref name=\"Classifier performance\"/>\n\n==== Neural networks ====\n{{Main article|Artificial neural network|Connectionism}}\n[[File:Artificial neural network.svg|thumb|A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of [[neuron]]s in the [[human brain]].]]\n\nThe study of non-learning [[artificial neural network]]s<ref name=\"Neural networks\"/> began in the decade before the field of AI research was founded, in the work of [[Walter Pitts]] and [[Warren McCullouch]].  [[Frank Rosenblatt]] invented the [[perceptron]], a learning network with a single layer, similar to the old concept of [[linear regression]]. Early pioneers also include [[Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko]], [[Teuvo Kohonen]], [[Stephen Grossberg]], [[Kunihiko Fukushima]], Christoph von der Malsburg, David Willshaw, [[Shun-Ichi Amari]], [[Bernard Widrow]], [[John Hopfield]], [[Eduardo R. Caianiello]], and others.\n\nThe main categories of networks are acyclic or [[feedforward neural network]]s (where the signal passes in only one direction) and [[recurrent neural network]]s (which allow feedback and short-term memories of previous input events). Among the most popular feedforward networks are [[perceptron]]s, [[multi-layer perceptron]]s and [[radial basis network]]s.<ref name=\"Feedforward neural networks\"/>  Neural networks can be applied to the problem of [[intelligent control]] (for robotics) or [[machine learning|learning]], using such techniques as  [[Hebbian learning]], [[GMDH]] or [[competitive learning]].<ref name=\"Learning in neural networks\"/>\n\nToday, neural networks are often trained by the [[backpropagation]] algorithm, which had been around since 1970 as the reverse mode of [[automatic differentiation]] published by [[Seppo Linnainmaa]],<ref name=\"lin1970\">[[Seppo Linnainmaa]] (1970).

Such tests have been termed [[subject matter expert Turing test]]s. Smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an ever-increasing number of positive results.<ref name=\"Subject matter expert Turing test\"/>\n\nOne classification for outcomes of an AI test is:{{sfn|Rajani|2011}}\n# Optimal: it is not possible to perform better.\n# Strong super-human: performs better than all humans.\n# Super-human: performs better than most humans.\n# Sub-human: performs worse than most humans.\n\nFor example, performance at [[draughts]] (i.e. checkers) is optimal,<ref name=\"Game AI\"/> performance at chess is super-human and nearing strong super-human (see [[Computer chess#Computers versus humans|computer chess:&nbsp;computers versus human]]) and performance at many everyday tasks (such as recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into something) is sub-human.\n\nA quite different approach measures machine intelligence through tests which are developed from ''mathematical'' definitions of intelligence. Examples of these kinds of tests start in the late nineties devising intelligence tests using notions from [[Kolmogorov complexity]] and [[data compression]].<ref name=\"Mathematical definitions of intelligence\"/> Two major advantages of mathematical definitions are their applicability to nonhuman intelligences and their absence of a requirement for human testers.\n\nA derivative of the Turing test is the Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart ([[CAPTCHA]]). As the name implies, this helps to determine that a user is an actual person and not a computer posing as a human. In contrast to the standard Turing test, CAPTCHA administered by a machine and targeted to a human as opposed to being administered by a human and targeted to a machine. A computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test. Computers are unable to solve the problem, so correct solutions are deemed to be the result of a person taking the test. A common type of CAPTCHA is the test that requires the typing of distorted letters, numbers or symbols that appear in an image undecipherable by a computer.{{sfn|O'Brien|Marakas|2011}}\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:Automated online assistant.png|thumb|An [[automated online assistant]] providing customer service on a web page \u2013 one of many very primitive applications of artificial intelligence.]]\n{{Main article|Applications of artificial intelligence}}\n\nAI is relevant to any intellectual task.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2009|p=1}} Modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here.

How can we ensure that machines behave ethically and that they are used ethically?\n# Can a machine have a [[mind]], [[consciousness]] and [[philosophy of mind|mental states]] in exactly the same sense that human beings do?

This is known as the AI Effect: \"AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.\"<!--<ref name=\"AI Effect\"/>-->\n\n=== Intelligent behaviour and machine ethics ===\nAs a minimum, an AI system must be able to reproduce aspects of human intelligence. This  raises the issue of how ethically the machine should behave towards both humans and other AI agents. This issue was addressed by Wendell Wallach in his book titled ''Moral Machines'' in which he introduced the concept of [[Moral agency#Artificial moral agents|artificial moral agents]] (AMA).<ref>Wendell Wallach (2010). ''Moral Machines'', Oxford University Press.</ref> For Wallach, AMAs have become a part of the research landscape of artificial intelligence as guided by its two central questions which he identifies as \"Does Humanity Want Computers Making Moral Decisions\"<ref>Wallach, pp 37\u201354.</ref> and \"Can (Ro)bots Really Be Moral\".<ref>Wallach, pp 55\u201373.</ref> For Wallach the question is not centered on the issue of ''whether'' machines can demonstrate the equivalent of moral behavior in contrast to the ''constraints'' which society may place on the development of AMAs.<ref>Wallach, Introduction chapter.</ref>\n\n==== Machine ethics ====\n{{Main article|Machine ethics}}\nThe field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter, enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Michael Anderson and Susan Leigh Anderson (2011), Machine Ethics, Cambridge University Press.</ref> The field was delineated in the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics: \"Past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings, with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines. In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. The time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems\u2014it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence. Further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about Ethics.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aaai.org/Library/Symposia/Fall/fs05-06|title=Machine Ethics|work=aaai.org}}</ref> Machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality.

Hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of mankind, and would be extremely difficult to stop. This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth.\n\nPhysicist [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Microsoft]] founder [[Bill Gates]] and [[SpaceX]] founder [[Elon Musk]] have expressed concerns about the possibility that AI could evolve to the point that humans could not control it, with Hawking theorizing that this could \"[[Global catastrophic risk|spell the end of the human race]]\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nOne proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent AI is '[[Friendly AI]]', and will then be able to control subsequently developed AIs. Some question whether this kind of check could really remain in place.\n\nLeading AI researcher [[Rodney Brooks]] writes, \"I think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent AI anytime in the next few hundred years.

Weizenbaum was also bothered that AI researchers (and some philosophers) were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program (a position now known as [[computationalism]]).

This question is closely related to the philosophical problem as to the nature of human consciousness, generally referred to as the [[hard problem of consciousness]].\n\n==== Consciousness ====\n{{Main article|Hard problem of consciousness|Theory of mind}}\n{{expand section|date=March 2016}}\n\n==== Computationalism ====\n{{Main article|Computationalism|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)}}\nComputationalism is the position in the [[philosophy of mind]] that the human mind or the human brain (or both) is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing.<ref>[[Steven Horst|Horst, Steven]], (2005) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/ \"The Computational Theory of Mind\"] in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''</ref> Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the [[mind-body problem]]. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Hilary Putnam]].\n\n==== Strong AI hypothesis ====\n{{Main article|Chinese room}}\nThe philosophical position that John Searle has named [[strong AI hypothesis|\"strong AI\"]] states: \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"<ref name=\"Searle's strong AI\"/> Searle counters this assertion with his [[Chinese room]] argument, which asks us to look ''inside'' the computer and try to find where the \"mind\" might be.<ref name=\"Chinese room\"/>\n\n==== Robot rights ====\n{{Main article|Robot rights}}\n[[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' considers a key issue in the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]: if a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also ''[[sentience|feel]]''? If it can feel, does it have the same rights as a human? The idea also appears in modern science fiction, such as the film ''[[A.I.: Artificial Intelligence]]'', in which humanoid machines have the ability to feel emotions. This issue, now known as \"[[robot rights]]\", is currently being considered by, for example, California's [[Institute for the Future]], although many critics believe that the discussion is premature.<ref name=\"Robot rights\"/> The subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film ''[[Plug & Pray]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plugandpray-film.de/en/content.html|title=Content: Plug & Pray Film - Artificial Intelligence - Robots - |author=maschafilm|work=plugandpray-film.de}}</ref>\n\n=== Superintelligence ===\n{{Main article|Superintelligence}}\nAre there limits to how intelligent machines&nbsp;\u2013 or human-machine hybrids&nbsp;\u2013 can be?

The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to [[Intelligence explosion|recursive self-improvement]].<ref name=\"recurse\"/> The new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans.

He argues that sufficiently intelligent AI, if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal, will exhibit [[Instrumental convergence|convergent]] behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down. If this AI's goals do not reflect humanity's - one example is an AI told to compute as many digits of pi as possible - it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, ultimately to better achieve its goal.\n\nFor this danger to be realized, the hypothetical AI would have to overpower or out-think all of humanity, which a minority of experts argue is a possibility far enough in the future to not be worth researching.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Is artificial intelligence really an existential threat to humanity?|url = http://thebulletin.org/artificial-intelligence-really-existential-threat-humanity8577|website = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = The case against killer robots, from a guy actually working on artificial intelligence|url = http://fusion.net/story/54583/the-case-against-killer-robots-from-a-guy-actually-building-ai/|website = Fusion.net|accessdate = 2016-01-31}}</ref> Other counterarguments revolve around humans being either intrinsically or convergently valuable from the perspective of an artificial intelligence.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Will artificial intelligence destroy humanity?

In January 2015, [[Elon Musk]] donated ten million dollars to the [[Future of Life Institute]] to fund research on understanding AI decision making.

Early stories typically revolved around intelligent robots. The word \"robot\" itself was coined by [[Karel \u010capek]] in his 1921 play ''[[R.U.R.]]'', the title standing for \"[[Rossum's Universal Robots]]\". Later, the SF writer [[Isaac Asimov]] developed the [[Three Laws of Robotics]] which he subsequently explored in a long series of robot stories. These laws have since gained some traction in genuine AI research.\n\nIn [[Mary Shelley]]'s [[Frankenstein]] (1818), [[Victor Frankenstein]] creates a monster in his laboratory using electricity and dead corpses. This use of artificial intelligence casts horror upon society and elicits regret from Victor. Shelley's idea of creating a human from non-living material came from previous alchemists who attempted similar tasks, such as [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] and [[Paracelsus]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Articles/rowen.html|title=Rowen, \"The Making of Frankenstein's Monster\"|website=knarf.english.upenn.edu|access-date=2016-11-15}}</ref>\n\nThe novel [[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]], by [[Philip K. Dick]], tells a science fiction story about Androids and humans clashing in a futuristic world. Elements of artificial intelligence include the empathy box, mood organ, and the androids themselves. Throughout the novel, Dick portrays the idea that human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Galvan|first=Jill|date=1997-01-01|title=Entering the Posthuman Collective in Philip K.

Clarke]].\n\nAI has since become firmly rooted in popular culture and is in many films, such as ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984) and ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'' (2001).\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Glossary of artificial intelligence]]\n* [[Abductive reasoning]]\n* [[Case-based reasoning]]\n* [[Commonsense reasoning]]\n*[[Soft computing]]\n** [[Machine learning]]\n**[[Evolutionary computing]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<!-- unused ref\n<ref name=\"TOPIO\">\n[[TOPIO]]:\n* {{Cite news|url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-02/ping-pong-playing-terminator |title=A Ping-Pong-Playing Terminator |publisher=Popular Science }}\n* {{Cite news|url=http://www.gadgetrivia.com/8164-best_robot_international_robot_exhibition |title=Best robot 2009 |publisher=gadgetrivia.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724025845/http://www.gadgetrivia.com:80/8164-best_robot_international_robot_exhibition |archivedate=24 July 2010 }}</ref>\n-->\n\n<!-- INTRODUCTION ------------------------------------------------------------------------------>\n\n<!-- <ref name=\"Definition of AI\"> -->\nDefinition of AI as the study of [[intelligent agents]]:\n* {{Harvnb|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|loc=[http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~poole/ci/ch1.pdf p. 1]}}, which provides the version that is used in this article.
