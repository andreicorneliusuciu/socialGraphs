[[Touchscreen]]s are an example that combines different devices into a single hardware component that can be used both as an input and output device.\n\nA peripheral device is generally defined as any auxiliary device such as a [[computer mouse]] or [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] that connects to and works with the computer in some way. Other examples of peripherals are [[image scanner]]s, [[tape drive]]s, [[microphone]]s, [[loudspeaker]]s, [[webcam]]s, and [[digital camera]]s.  Many modern devices, such as digital [[watch]]es, [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer]]s, have interfaces that allow them to be used as a peripheral by desktop computers, although they are not host-dependent in the same way as other peripheral devices.\n\nCommon input peripherals include [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboards]], [[Computer mouse|computer mice]], [[graphic tablet]]s, [[touchscreen]]s, [[barcode reader]]s, [[image scanner]]s, [[microphone]]s, [[webcam]]s, [[game controller]]s, [[light pen]]s, and [[digital camera]]s.  Common output peripherals include [[computer display]]s, [[Printer (computing)|printers]], [[projector]]s, and [[computer speaker]]s.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n\n* [[Computer hardware]]\n* [[Controller (computing)]]\n* [[Display device]]\n* [[Expansion card]]\n* [[Punched card input/output]]\n* [[Punched tape]]\n* [[Video game accessory]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Computer science}}\n[[Category:Computer peripherals| ]]"}]}}}}
