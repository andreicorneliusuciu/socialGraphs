Examples of such channels are [[copper wire]]s, [[optical fiber]]s, [[wireless]] communication channels, [[storage media]] and [[Bus (computing)|computer bus]]es. The data are represented as an [[Electromagnetic field|electromagnetic]] [[Signal (electronics)|signal]], such as an [[electrical voltage]], [[radiowave]], [[microwave]], or [[infrared]] signal.\n\nAnalog or analogue transmission is a transmission method of conveying voice, data, image, signal or video information using a continuous signal which varies in amplitude, phase, or some other property in proportion to that of a variable. The messages are either represented by a sequence of pulses by means of a [[line code]] (''[[baseband]] transmission''), or by a limited set of continuously varying wave forms (''[[passband]] transmission''), using a digital [[modulation]] method. The passband modulation and corresponding demodulation (also known as detection) is carried out by [[modem]] equipment. According to the most common definition of [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]], both baseband and passband signals representing bit-streams are considered as digital transmission, while an alternative definition only considers the baseband signal as digital, and passband transmission of digital data as a form of [[digital-to-analog conversion]].\n\nData transmitted may be digital messages originating from a data source, for example a computer or a keyboard. It may also be an analog signal such as a phone call or a video signal, [[digitize]]d into a bit-stream for example using [[pulse-code modulation]] (PCM) or more advanced [[source coding]] ([[analog-to-digital conversion]] and [[data compression]]) schemes. This source coding and decoding is carried out by [[codec]] equipment.\n\n==Distinction between related subjects==\nCourses and textbooks in the field of ''data transmission''<ref name=\"Clark\">A.

Basic principles of data transmission may also be covered within the [[computer science]]/[[computer engineering]] topic of [[data communication]]s, which also includes [[computer networking]] or [[computer communication]] applications and networking protocols, for example routing, switching and [[inter-process communication]]. Although the [[Transmission control protocol]] (TCP) involves the term \"transmission\", TCP and other transport layer protocols are typically ''not'' discussed in a textbook or course about data transmission, but in computer networking.\n\nThe term [[tele transmission]] involves the analog as well as digital communication. In most textbooks, the term [[analog transmission]] only refers to the transmission of an analog message signal (without digitization) by means of an analog signal, either as a non-modulated baseband signal, or as a passband signal using an [[analog modulation method]] such as [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] or [[Frequency modulation|FM]]. It may also include analog-over-analog [[Modulation#Pulse modulation methods|pulse modulatated]] baseband signals such as pulse-width modulation. In a few books within the computer networking tradition, \"analog transmission\" also refers to passband transmission of bit-streams using [[digital modulation]] methods such as [[frequency-shift keying|FSK]], [[phase-shift keying|PSK]] and [[amplitude-shift keying|ASK]]. Note that these methods are covered in textbooks named digital transmission or data transmission, for example.<ref name=\"Clark\" />\n\nThe theoretical aspects of data transmission are covered by [[information theory]] and [[coding theory]].\n\n==Protocol layers and sub-topics==\n{{OSIModel}}\nCourses and textbooks in the field of data transmission typically deal with the following [[OSI model]] protocol layers and topics:\n* Layer 1, the [[physical layer]]:\n** [[Channel coding]] including\n*** [[Digital modulation]] schemes\n*** [[Line coding]] schemes\n*** [[Forward error correction]] (FEC) codes\n** [[Bit synchronization]]\n** [[Multiplexing]]\n** [[Equalization (communications)|Equalization]]\n** [[Channel model]]s\n* Layer 2, the [[data link layer]]:\n** [[Channel access]] schemes, [[media access control]] (MAC)\n** Packet mode communication and [[Frame synchronization]]\n** [[Error detection]] and [[automatic repeat request]] (ARQ)\n** [[Flow control (data)|Flow control]]\n* Layer 6, the [[presentation layer]]:\n** [[Source coding]] (digitization and data compression), and information theory.\n** [[Cryptography]] (may occur at any layer)\n\n==Applications and history==\nData (mainly but not exclusively [[information]]al) has been sent via non-electronic (e.g. [[optical]], [[acoustics|acoustic]], [[Classical mechanics|mechanical]]) means since the advent of [[communication]]. [[Analog signal]] data has been sent electronically since the [[History of the telephone|advent of the telephone]]. However, the first data electromagnetic transmission applications in modern time were [[telegraphy]] (1809) and [[teletypewriter]]s (1906), which are both [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]]s. The fundamental theoretical work in data transmission and information theory by [[Harry Nyquist]], [[Ralph Hartley]], [[Claude Shannon]] and others during the early 20th century, was done with these applications in mind.\n\nData transmission is utilized in [[computers]] in [[computer bus]]es and for communication with [[peripheral equipment]] via [[parallel port]]s and [[serial port]]s such as [[RS-232]] (1969), [[Firewire]] (1995) and [[USB]] (1996). The principles of data transmission are also utilized in storage media for [[Error detection and correction#Data storage|Error detection and correction]] since 1951.\n\nData transmission is utilized in [[computer networking]] equipment such as [[modems]] (1940), [[local area network]]s (LAN) adapters (1964), [[repeater]]s, [[network hub|hubs]], [[microwave link]]s, [[wireless access point|wireless network access point]]s (1997), etc.\n\nIn telephone networks, digital communication is utilized for transferring many phone calls over the same copper cable or fiber cable by means of [[Pulse code modulation]] (PCM), i.e. sampling and digitization, in combination with [[Time division multiplexing]] (TDM) (1962). [[Telephone exchange]]s have become digital and software controlled, facilitating many value added services. For example, the first [[AXE telephone exchange]] was presented in 1976. Since the late 1980s, digital communication to the end user has been possible using [[Integrated Services Digital Network]] (ISDN) services. Since the end of the 1990s, broadband access techniques such as [[ADSL]], [[Cable modem]]s, [[fiber-to-the-building]] (FTTB) and [[fiber-to-the-home]] (FTTH) have become widespread to small offices and homes. The current tendency is to replace traditional telecommunication services by packet mode communication such as [[IP telephony]] and [[IPTV]].\n\nTransmitting analog signals digitally allows for greater [[Digital signal processing|signal processing]] capability. The ability to process a communications signal means that errors caused by random processes can be detected and corrected. Digital signals can also be [[sampling (signal processing)|sampled]] instead of continuously monitored. The [[multiplexing]] of multiple digital signals is much simpler to the multiplexing of analog signals.\n\nBecause of all these advantages, and because recent advances in [[wideband]] [[communication channel]]s and [[solid-state electronics]] have allowed scientists to fully realize these advantages, digital communications has grown quickly. Digital communications is quickly edging out analog communication because of the vast demand to transmit computer data and the ability of digital communications to do so.\n\nThe digital revolution has also resulted in many digital [[telecommunication]] applications where the principles of data transmission are applied. Examples are [[2G|second-generation]] (1991) and later [[cellular telephony]], [[video conferencing]], [[digital TV]] (1998), [[digital radio]] (1999), [[telemetry]], etc.\n\nData transmission, digital transmission or digital communications is the physical transfer of data (a digital bit stream or a digitized analog signal[1]) over a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communication channel. Examples of such channels are copper wires, optical fibers, wireless communication channels, storage media and computer buses. The data are represented as an electromagnetic signal, such as an electrical voltage, radiowave, microwave, or infrared signal.\n\nWhile analog transmission is the transfer of a continuously varying analog signal over an analog channel, digital communications is the transfer of discrete messages over a digital or an analog channel. The messages are either represented by a sequence of pulses by means of a line code (baseband transmission), or by a limited set of continuously varying wave forms (passband transmission), using a digital modulation method. The passband modulation and corresponding demodulation (also known as detection) is carried out by modem equipment. According to the most common definition of digital signal, both baseband and passband signals representing bit-streams are considered as digital transmission, while an alternative definition only considers the baseband signal as digital, and passband transmission of digital data as a form of digital-to-analog conversion.\n\nData transmitted may be digital messages originating from a data source, for example a computer or a keyboard. It may also be an analog signal such as a phone call or a video signal, digitized into a bit-stream for example using pulse-code modulation (PCM) or more advanced source coding (analog-to-digital conversion and data compression) schemes. This source coding and decoding is carried out by codec equipment.\n\n==Serial and parallel transmission==\nIn telecommunications, [[serial transmission]] is the sequential [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[signal element]]s of a group representing a [[Character (computing)|character]] or other entity of [[data]]. Digital serial transmissions are bits sent over a single wire, frequency or optical path sequentially. Because it requires less [[signal processing]] and less chances for error than parallel transmission, the transfer rate of each individual path may be faster. This can be used over longer distances as a check digit or [[parity bit]] can be sent along it easily.\n\nIn telecommunications, [[parallel transmission]] is the simultaneous transmission of the [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] elements of a character or other entity of data. In [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital]] communications, parallel transmission is the simultaneous transmission of related signal elements over two or more separate paths. Multiple electrical wires are used which can transmit multiple bits simultaneously, which allows for higher data transfer rates than can be achieved with serial transmission. This method is used internally within the computer, for example the internal buses, and sometimes externally for such things as printers, The major issue with this is \"skewing\" because the wires in parallel data transmission have slightly different properties (not intentionally) so some bits may arrive before others, which may corrupt the message. A parity bit can help to reduce this. However, electrical wire parallel data transmission is therefore less reliable for long distances because corrupt transmissions are far more likely.\n\n==Types of communication channels==\n{{main|communication channel}}\n\nSome communications channel types include:\n* [[Data transmission circuit]]\n* [[Duplex (telecommunications)#Full-duplex|Full-duplex]]\n* [[Duplex (telecommunications)#Half-duplex|Half-duplex]]\n* [[Multidrop bus|Multi-drop]]:\n** [[Bus network]]\n** [[Mesh network]]\n** [[Ring network]]\n** [[Star network]]\n** [[Wireless network]]\n* [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|Point-to-point]]\n* [[Simplex communication|Simplex]]\n\n==Asynchronous and synchronous data transmission==\n{{Main|comparison of synchronous and asynchronous signalling}}\n{{Misleading|section|date=August 2012}}\n\n'''[[Asynchronous start-stop]] transmission''' uses start and stop bits to signify the beginning bit{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} [[ASCII]] character would actually be transmitted using 10 bits.  For example, \"0100 0001\" would become \"'''1''' 0100 0001 '''0'''\". The extra one (or zero, depending on [[parity bit]]) at the start and end of the transmission tells the receiver first that a character is coming and secondly that the character has ended. This method of transmission is used when data are sent intermittently as opposed to in a solid stream. In the previous example the start and stop bits are in bold. The start and stop bits must be of opposite polarity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} This allows the receiver to recognize when the second packet of information is being sent.\n\n'''Synchronous transmission''' uses no start and stop bits, but instead synchronizes transmission speeds at both the receiving and sending end of the transmission using [[clock]] signal(s) built into each component.{{Vague|date=April 2010}} A continual stream of [[data]] is then sent between the two nodes. Due to there being no start and stop [[bit]]s the data transfer rate is quicker although more errors will occur, as the clocks will eventually get out of sync, and the receiving device would have the wrong time that had been agreed in the [[protocol (computing)|protocol]] for sending/receiving data, so some [[byte]]s could become corrupted (by losing [[bit]]s).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Ways to get around this problem include re-synchronization of the clocks and use of [[check digit]]s to ensure the [[byte]] is correctly interpreted and received\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Computer networking]]\n* [[Information theory]]\n* [[Media (communication)]]\n* [[Signal processing]]\n* [[Telecommunication]]\n* [[Transmission (disambiguation)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Data Transmission}}\n[[Category:Data transmission| ]]\n[[Category:Computer networking]]\n[[Category:Media technology]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications]]"}]}}}}
