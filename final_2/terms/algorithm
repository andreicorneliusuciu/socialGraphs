The algorithm proceeds by successive subtractions in two loops: IF the test B \u2265 A yields \"yes\" (or true) (more accurately the ''number'' ''b'' in location B is greater than or equal to the ''number'' ''a'' in location A) THEN, the algorithm specifies B \u2190 B \u2212 A (meaning the number ''b'' \u2212 ''a'' replaces the old ''b''). Similarly, IF A > B, THEN A \u2190 A \u2212 B. The process terminates when (the contents of) B is 0, yielding the g.c.d. in A. (Algorithm derived from Scott 2009:13; symbols and drawing style from Tausworthe 1977).]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], an '''algorithm''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-algorithm.ogg|\u02c8|\u00e6|l|\u0261|\u0259|r|\u026a|\u00f0|\u0259m}} {{respell|AL|g\u0259-ri-dh\u0259m}}) is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed. Algorithms perform [[calculation]], [[data processing]], and/or [[automated reasoning]] tasks.\n\nThe English word 'algorithm' comes from Medieval Latin word [[algorism]] and the Greek word  \"arithmos\" (\u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2). The word 'algorism' (and therefore, the derived word 'algorithm') comes from [[Al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b]] ({{lang-fa|\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0632\u0645\u06cc}}, {{abbr|c.|circa}} 780\u2013850), a [[Persian people|Persian]] mathematician, [[astronomer]], [[geographer]], and scholar. English adopted the French term, but it wasn't until the late 19th century that \"algorithm\" took on the meaning that it has in modern English.\n\nIn English, it was first used about 1230 and then by Chaucer in 1391. Another early use of the word is from 1240, in a manual titled ''Carmen de Algorismo'' composed by [[Alexander of Villedieu|Alexandre de Villedieu]].\n\nIt begins thus:\n\n{{quote|''Haec algorismus ars praesens dicitur, in qua / Talibus Indorum fruimur bis quinque figuris.''}}\nwhich translates as:\n{{quote|Algorism is the art by which at present we use those Indian figures, which number two times five.}}\n\nThe poem is not very long, only a few hundred lines, and summarizes the art of calculating with the new style of Indian dice, or Talibus Indorum, or Hindu numerals or al-adad  al-Hindi\n\nAn algorithm is an [[effective method]] that can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time<ref>\"Any classical mathematical algorithm, for example, can be described in a finite number of English words\" (Rogers 1987:2).</ref> and in a well-defined formal language<ref>Well defined with respect to the agent that executes the algorithm: \"There is a computing agent, usually human, which can react to the instructions and carry out the computations\" (Rogers 1987:2).</ref> for calculating a [[Function (mathematics)|function]].<ref>\"an algorithm is a procedure for computing a ''function'' (with respect to some chosen notation for integers) ... this limitation (to numerical functions) results in no loss of generality\", (Rogers 1987:1).</ref>  Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps [[null string|empty]]),<ref>\"An algorithm has [[zero]] or more inputs, i.e., [[quantity|quantities]] which are given to it initially before the algorithm begins\" (Knuth 1973:5).</ref> the instructions describe a [[computation]] that, when [[Execution (computing)|executed]], proceeds through a finite<ref>\"A procedure which has all the characteristics of an algorithm except that it possibly lacks finiteness may be called a 'computational method'\" (Knuth 1973:5).</ref> number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing \"output\"<ref>\"An algorithm has one or more outputs, i.e. quantities which have a specified relation to the inputs\" (Knuth 1973:5).</ref> and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily [[deterministic]]; some algorithms, known as [[randomized algorithms]], incorporate random input.<ref>Whether or not a process with random interior processes (not including the input) is an algorithm is debatable. Rogers opines that: \"a computation is carried out in a discrete stepwise fashion, without use of continuous methods or analogue devices . . . carried forward deterministically, without resort to random methods or devices, e.g., dice\" Rogers 1987:2.</ref>\n\nThe concept of ''algorithm'' has existed for centuries; however, a partial formalization of what would become the modern ''algorithm'' began with attempts to solve the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] (the \"decision problem\") posed by [[David Hilbert]] in 1928. Subsequent formalizations were framed as attempts to define \"[[effective calculability]]\"<ref>Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:274</ref> or \"effective method\";<ref>Rosser 1939 in Davis 1965:225</ref> those formalizations included the [[Kurt G\u00f6del|G\u00f6del]]\u2013[[Jacques Herbrand|Herbrand]]\u2013[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive function]]s of 1930, 1934 and 1935, [[Alonzo Church]]'s [[lambda calculus]] of 1936, [[Emil Post]]'s \"[[Formulation 1]]\" of 1936, and [[Alan Turing]]'s [[Turing machines]] of 1936\u20137 and 1939. Giving a formal definition of algorithms, corresponding to the intuitive notion, remains a challenging problem.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Moschovakis| first1 = Yiannis N.| editor1-last = Engquist| editor1-first = B.| editor2-last = Schmid| editor2-first = W.| title = Mathematics Unlimited \u2014 2001 and beyond| url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.32.8093| year = 2001| publisher = Springer| isbn = 9783540669135| pages = 919\u2013936 (Part II)| chapter = What is an algorithm? }}</ref>\n\n== Informal definition ==\n{{about||a detailed presentation of the various points of view on the definition of \"algorithm\"| Algorithm characterizations}}\nAn informal definition could be \"a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations.\"<ref>Stone 1973:4</ref> which would include all computer programs, including programs that do not perform numeric calculations.  Generally, a program is only an algorithm if it stops eventually.<ref>Stone simply requires that \"it must terminate in a finite number of steps\" (Stone 1973:7\u20138).</ref>\n\nA prototypical example of an algorithm is [[Euclid's algorithm]] to determine the maximum common divisor of two integers; an example (there are others) is described by the [[flow chart]] above and as an example in a later section.\n\n{{Harvtxt|Boolos|Jeffrey|1974, 1999|ref=CITEREFBoolosJeffrey1999}} offer an informal meaning of the word in the following quotation:\n\n<blockquote>No human being can write fast enough, or long enough, or small enough\u2020 ( \u2020\"smaller and smaller without limit ...you'd be trying to write on molecules, on atoms, on electrons\") to list all members of an enumerably infinite set by writing out their names, one after another, in some notation. But humans can do something equally useful, in the case of certain enumerably infinite sets: They can give ''explicit instructions for determining the '''n'''th member of the set'', for arbitrary finite ''n''. Such instructions are to be given quite explicitly, in a form in which ''they could be followed by a computing machine'', or by a ''human who is capable of carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols.''<ref>Boolos and Jeffrey 1974,1999:19</ref></blockquote>\n\nAn \"enumerably infinite set\" is one whose elements can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the integers. Thus, Boolos and Jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions for a process that \"creates\" output integers from an ''arbitrary'' \"input\" integer or integers that, in theory, can be arbitrarily large. Thus an algorithm can be an algebraic equation such as ''y = m + n'' \u2013 two arbitrary \"input variables\" ''m'' and ''n'' that produce an output ''y''. But various authors' attempts to define the notion indicate that the word implies much more than this, something on the order of (for the addition example):\n:Precise instructions (in language understood by \"the computer\")<ref>cf Stone 1972:5</ref> for a fast, efficient, \"good\"<ref>Knuth 1973:7 states: \"In practice we not only want algorithms, we want ''good'' algorithms ... one criterion of goodness is the length of time taken to perform the algorithm ... other criteria are the adaptability of the algorithm to computers, its simplicity and elegance, etc.\"</ref> process that specifies the \"moves\" of \"the computer\" (machine or human, equipped with the necessary internally contained information and capabilities)<ref>cf Stone 1973:6</ref> to find, decode, and then process arbitrary input integers/symbols ''m'' and ''n'', symbols ''+'' and ''='' ... and \"effectively\"<ref>Stone 1973:7\u20138 states that there must be, \"...a procedure that a robot [i.e., computer] can follow in order to determine precisely how to obey the instruction.\" Stone adds finiteness of the process, and definiteness (having no ambiguity in the instructions) to this definition.</ref> produce, in a \"reasonable\" time,<ref>Knuth, loc. cit</ref> output-integer ''y'' at a specified place and in a specified format.\n\nThe concept of ''algorithm'' is also used to define the notion of [[decidability (logic)|decidability]]. That notion is central for explaining how [[formal system]]s come into being starting from a small set of [[axiom]]s and rules. In [[logic]], the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured, as it is not apparently related with our customary physical dimension. From such uncertainties, that characterize ongoing work, stems the unavailability of a definition of ''algorithm'' that suits both concrete (in some sense) and abstract usage of the term.\n\n== Formalization ==\n<!--  [[Computer program]] links here. -->\nAlgorithms are essential to the way computers process data. Many computer programs contain algorithms that detail the specific instructions a computer should perform (in a specific order) to carry out a specified task, such as calculating employees' paychecks or printing students' report cards. Thus, an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations that can be simulated by a [[Turing reduction|Turing-complete]] system. Authors who assert this thesis include Minsky (1967), Savage (1987) and Gurevich (2000):\n<blockquote> Minsky: \"But we will also maintain, with Turing . . . that any procedure which could \"naturally\" be called effective, can in fact be realized by a (simple) machine. Although this may seem extreme, the arguments . . . in its favor are hard to refute\".<ref name=\"Minsky 1967:105\">{{harvnb|Minsky|1967|page=105}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n <blockquote>Gurevich: \"...Turing's informal argument in favor of his thesis justifies a stronger thesis: every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine ... according to Savage [1987], an algorithm is a computational process defined by a Turing machine\".<ref>Gurevich 2000:1, 3</ref></blockquote>\n\nTypically, when an algorithm is associated with processing information, data are read from an input source, written to an output device, and/or stored for further processing. Stored data are regarded as part of the internal state of the entity performing the algorithm. In practice, the state is stored in one or more [[data structure]]s.\n\nFor some such computational process, the algorithm must be rigorously defined: specified in the way it applies in all possible circumstances that could arise. That is, any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with, case-by-case; the criteria for each case must be clear (and computable).\n\nBecause an algorithm is a precise list of precise steps, the order of computation is always crucial to the functioning of the algorithm. Instructions are usually assumed to be listed explicitly, and are described as starting \"from the top\" and going \"down to the bottom\", an idea that is described more formally by ''[[control flow|flow of control]]''.\n\nSo far, this discussion of the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of [[imperative programming]]. This is the most common conception, and it attempts to describe a task in discrete, \"mechanical\" means. Unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the [[assignment operation]], setting the value of a variable. It derives from the intuition of \"[[memory]]\" as a scratchpad. There is an example below of such an assignment.\n\nFor some alternate conceptions of what constitutes an algorithm see [[functional programming]] and [[logic programming]].\n\n=== Expressing algorithms ===\nAlgorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation, including [[natural language]]s, [[pseudocode]], [[flowchart]]s, [[DRAKON|drakon-chart]]s, [[programming language]]s or [[control table]]s (processed by [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreters]]). Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms. Pseudocode, flowcharts, [[DRAKON|drakon-chart]]s and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in natural language statements. Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a computer, but are often used as a way to define or document algorithms.\n\nThere is a wide variety of representations possible and one can express a given [[Turing machine]] program as a sequence of machine tables (see more at [[finite state machine]], [[state transition table]] and [[control table]]), as flowcharts and [[DRAKON|drakon-chart]]s (see more at [[state diagram]]), or as a form of rudimentary [[machine code]] or [[assembly code]] called \"sets of quadruples\" (see more at [[Turing machine]]).\n\nRepresentations of algorithms can be classed into three accepted levels of Turing machine description:<ref>Sipser 2006:157</ref>\n; 1 High-level description\n: \"...prose to describe an algorithm, ignoring the implementation details. At this level we do not need to mention how the machine manages its tape or head.\"\n; 2 Implementation description\n: \"...prose used to define the way the Turing machine uses its head and the way that it stores data on its tape. At this level we do not give details of states or transition function.\"\n; 3 Formal description\n: Most detailed, \"lowest level\", gives the Turing machine's \"state table\".\n\nFor an example of the simple algorithm \"Add m+n\" described in all three levels, see [[Algorithm#Examples]].\n\n== Implementation ==\n[[Image:TTL npn nand.svg|right|thumb|[[Logical NAND]] algorithm implemented electronically in [[7400 series|7400]] chip]]\nMost algorithms are intended to be implemented as [[computer programs]]. However, algorithms are also implemented by other means, such as in a biological [[neural network]] (for example, the [[human brain]] implementing [[arithmetic]] or an insect looking for food), in an [[electrical circuit]], or in a mechanical device.\n\n== Computer algorithms ==\n[[File:Euclid's algorithm structured blocks 1.png|thumb|right|176px|Flowchart examples of the canonical [[Structured program theorem|B\u00f6hm-Jacopini structures]]: the SEQUENCE (rectangles descending the page), the WHILE-DO and the IF-THEN-ELSE. The three structures are made of the primitive conditional GOTO (<tt>IF ''test''=true THEN GOTO step xxx</tt>) (a diamond), the unconditional GOTO (rectangle), various assignment operators (rectangle), and HALT (rectangle). Nesting of these structures inside assignment-blocks result in complex diagrams (cf Tausworthe 1977:100,114).]]\n\nIn [[computer systems]], an algorithm is basically an instance of [[logic]] written in software by software developers to be effective for the intended \"target\" computer(s) to produce ''output'' from given (perhaps null) ''input''. An optimal algorithm, even running in old hardware, would produce faster results than a non-optimal (higher [[time complexity]]) algorithm for the same purpose, running in more efficient hardware; that is why algorithms, like computer hardware, are considered technology.\n\n''\"Elegant\" (compact) programs, \"good\" (fast) programs '': The notion of \"simplicity and elegance\" appears informally in Knuth and precisely in Chaitin:\n:Knuth: \". . .we want ''good'' algorithms in some loosely defined aesthetic sense. One criterion . . . is the length of time taken to perform the algorithm . . .. Other criteria are adaptability of the algorithm to computers, its simplicity and elegance, etc\"<ref>Knuth 1973:7</ref>\n\n:Chaitin: \" . . . a program is 'elegant,' by which I mean that it's the smallest possible program for producing the output that it does\"<ref>Chaitin 2005:32</ref>\n\nChaitin prefaces his definition with: \"I'll show you can't prove that a program is 'elegant'\"\u2014such a proof would solve the [[Halting problem]] (ibid).\n\n''Algorithm versus function computable by an algorithm'': For a given function multiple algorithms may exist. This is true, even without expanding the available instruction set available to the programmer. Rogers observes that \"It is . . . important to distinguish between the notion of ''algorithm'', i.e. procedure and the notion of ''function computable by algorithm'', i.e. mapping yielded by procedure. The same function may have several different algorithms\".<ref>Rogers 1987:1\u20132</ref>\n\nUnfortunately there may be a tradeoff between goodness (speed) and elegance (compactness)\u2014an elegant program may take more steps to complete a computation than one less elegant. An example that uses Euclid's algorithm appears below.\n\n''Computers (and computors), models of computation'': A computer (or human \"computor\"<ref>In his essay \"Calculations by Man and Machine: Conceptual Analysis\" Seig 2002:390 credits this distinction to Robin Gandy, cf Wilfred Seig, et al., 2002 ''Reflections on the foundations of mathematics: Essays in honor of Solomon Feferman'', Association for Symbolic Logic, A.

Lambek references Melzak who defines his Q-machine as \"an indefinitely large number of locations . . . an indefinitely large supply of counters distributed among these locations, a program, and an operator whose sole purpose is to carry out the program\" (Melzak 1961:283). B-B-J (loc. cit.) add the stipulation that the holes are \"capable of holding any number of stones\" (p. 46). Both Melzak and Lambek appear in ''The Canadian Mathematical Bulletin'', vol. 4, no. 3, September 1961.</ref> reduced this notion to four elements: (i) discrete, distinguishable ''locations'', (ii) discrete, indistinguishable ''counters''<ref>If no confusion results, the word \"counters\" can be dropped, and a location can be said to contain a single \"number\".</ref> (iii) an agent, and (iv) a list of instructions that are ''effective'' relative to the capability of the agent.<ref>\"We say that an instruction is ''effective'' if there is a procedure that the robot can follow in order to determine precisely how to obey the instruction.\" (Stone 1972:6)</ref>\n\nMinsky describes a more congenial variation of Lambek's \"abacus\" model in his \"Very Simple Bases for [[Computability]]\".<ref>cf Minsky 1967: Chapter 11 \"Computer models\" and Chapter 14 \"Very Simple Bases for Computability\" pp. 255\u2013281 in particular</ref> [[Minsky machine|Minsky's machine]] proceeds sequentially through its five (or six, depending on how one counts) instructions, unless either a conditional IF\u2013THEN GOTO or an unconditional GOTO changes program flow out of sequence. Besides HALT, Minsky's machine includes three ''assignment'' (replacement, substitution)<ref>cf Knuth 1973:3.</ref> operations: ZERO (e.g. the contents of location replaced by 0: L \u2190 0), SUCCESSOR (e.g. L \u2190 L+1), and DECREMENT (e.g. L \u2190 L \u2212 1).<ref>But always preceded by IF\u2013THEN to avoid improper subtraction.</ref> Rarely must a programmer write \"code\" with such a limited instruction set. But Minsky shows (as do Melzak and Lambek) that his machine is [[Turing complete]] with only four general ''types'' of instructions: conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment/replacement/substitution, and HALT.<ref>However, a few different assignment instructions (e.g. DECREMENT, INCREMENT and ZERO/CLEAR/EMPTY for a Minsky machine) are also required for Turing-completeness; their exact specification is somewhat up to the designer. The unconditional GOTO is a convenience; it can be constructed by initializing a dedicated location to zero e.g. the instruction \" Z \u2190 0 \"; thereafter the instruction IF Z=0 THEN GOTO xxx is unconditional.</ref>\n\n''Simulation of an algorithm: computer (computor) language'': Knuth advises the reader that \"the best way to learn an algorithm is to try it . . . immediately take pen and paper and work through an example\".<ref>Knuth 1973:4</ref> But what about a simulation or execution of the real thing? The programmer must translate the algorithm into a language that the simulator/computer/computor can ''effectively'' execute. Stone gives an example of this: when computing the roots of a quadratic equation the computor must know how to take a square root. If they don't, then the algorithm, to be effective, must provide a set of rules for extracting a square root.<ref>Stone 1972:5. Methods for extracting roots are not trivial: see [[Methods of computing square roots]].</ref>\n\nThis means that the programmer must know a \"language\" that is effective relative to the target computing agent (computer/computor).\n\nBut what model should be used for the simulation? Van Emde Boas observes \"even if we base [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]] on abstract instead of concrete machines, arbitrariness of the choice of a model remains. It is at this point that the notion of ''simulation'' enters\".<ref>{{cite book| last = Leeuwen| first = Jan| title = Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science: Algorithms and complexity.

For example, the subprogram in Euclid's algorithm to compute the remainder would execute much faster if the programmer had a \"[[modular arithmetic|modulus]]\" instruction available rather than just subtraction (or worse: just Minsky's \"decrement\").\n\n''Structured programming, canonical structures'': Per the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis]], any algorithm can be computed by a model known to be [[Turing complete]], and per Minsky's demonstrations, Turing completeness requires only four instruction types\u2014conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment, HALT. Kemeny and Kurtz observe that, while \"undisciplined\" use of unconditional GOTOs and conditional IF-THEN GOTOs can result in \"[[spaghetti code]]\", a programmer can write structured programs using only these instructions; on the other hand \"it is also possible, and not too hard, to write badly structured programs in a structured language\".<ref>[[John G.

Its primary symbols are only four: the directed arrow showing program flow, the rectangle (SEQUENCE, GOTO), the diamond (IF-THEN-ELSE), and the dot (OR-tie). The B\u00f6hm\u2013Jacopini canonical structures are made of these primitive shapes. Sub-structures can \"nest\" in rectangles, but only if a single exit occurs from the superstructure.

He defines \"A number [to be] a multitude composed of units\": a counting number, a positive integer not including zero. To \"measure\" is to place a shorter measuring length ''s'' successively (''q'' times) along longer length ''l'' until the remaining portion ''r'' is less than the shorter length ''s''.<ref>\" 'Let CD, measuring BF, leave FA less than itself.'

Euclid stipulated this so that he could construct a [[reductio ad absurdum]] proof that the two numbers' common measure is in fact the ''greatest''.<ref>Euclid covers this question in his Proposition 1.</ref> While Nicomachus' algorithm is the same as Euclid's, when the numbers are prime to one another, it yields the number \"1\" for their common measure.

The high-level description, shown in boldface, is adapted from Knuth 1973:2\u20134:\n\n'''INPUT''':\n {{vanchor|1|el1}} [Into two locations L and S put the numbers ''l'' and ''s'' that represent the two lengths]:\n   INPUT L, S\n {{vanchor|2|el2}} [Initialize R: make the remaining length ''r'' equal to the starting/initial/input length ''l'']:\n   R \u2190 L\n\n'''E0: [Ensure ''r'' \u2265 ''s''.]'''\n {{vanchor|3|el3}} [Ensure the smaller of the two numbers is in S and the larger in R]:\n   IF R > S THEN\n     the contents of L is the larger number so skip over the exchange-steps [[#4|4]], [[#5|5]] and [[#6|6]]:\n     GOTO step [[#6|6]]\n   ELSE\n     swap the contents of R and S.\n {{vanchor|4|el4}}   L \u2190 R (this first step is redundant, but is useful for later discussion).\n {{vanchor|5|el5}}   R \u2190 S\n {{vanchor|6|el6}}   S \u2190 L\n\n'''E1: [Find remainder]''': Until the remaining length ''r'' in R is less than the shorter length ''s'' in S, repeatedly subtract the measuring number ''s'' in S from the remaining length ''r'' in R.\n {{vanchor|7|el7}} IF S > R THEN\n     done measuring so\n     GOTO [[#10|10]]\n   ELSE\n     measure again,\n {{vanchor|8|el8}}   R \u2190 R \u2212 S\n {{vanchor|9|el9}}   [Remainder-loop]:\n     GOTO [[#7|7]].\n\n'''E2: [Is the remainder zero?]''': EITHER (i) the last measure was exact, the remainder in R is zero, and the program can halt, OR (ii) the algorithm must continue: the last measure left a remainder in R less than measuring number in S.\n {{vanchor|10|el10}} IF R = 0 THEN\n      done so\n      GOTO [[#15|step 15]]\n    ELSE\n      CONTINUE TO [[#11|step 11]],\n\n'''E3: [Interchange ''s'' and ''r'']''': The nut of Euclid's algorithm.

The flowchart of \"Elegant\" can be found at the top of this article. In the (unstructured) Basic language, the steps are numbered, and the instruction <source lang=\"cbmbas\" inline>LET [] = []</source> is the assignment instruction symbolized by \u2190.\n<source lang=\"cbmbas\">\n  5 REM Euclid's algorithm for greatest common divisor\n  6 PRINT \"Type two integers greater than 0\"\n  10 INPUT A,B\n  20 IF B=0 THEN GOTO 80\n  30 IF A > B THEN GOTO 60\n  40 LET B=B-A\n  50 GOTO 20\n  60 LET A=A-B\n  70 GOTO 20\n  80 PRINT A\n  90 END\n</source>\nThe following version can be used with Object Oriented languages:\n<source lang=\"java\">\n// Euclid's algorithm for greatest common divisor\ninteger euclidAlgorithm (int A, int B){\n     A=Math.abs(A);\n     B=Math.abs(B);\n     while (B!=0){\n          if (A>B) A=A-B;\n          else B=B-A;\n     }\n     return A;\n}\n</source>\n''How \"Elegant\" works'': In place of an outer \"Euclid loop\", \"Elegant\" shifts back and forth between two \"co-loops\", an A > B loop that computes A \u2190 A \u2212 B, and a B \u2264 A loop that computes B \u2190 B \u2212 A. This works because, when at last the minuend M is less than or equal to the subtrahend S ( Difference = Minuend \u2212 Subtrahend), the minuend can become ''s'' (the new measuring length) and the subtrahend can become the new ''r'' (the length to be measured); in other words the \"sense\" of the subtraction reverses.\n\n=== Testing the Euclid algorithms ===\nDoes an algorithm do what its author wants it to do? A few test cases usually suffice to confirm core functionality. One source<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookVII/propVII2.html |title=Euclid's Elements, Book VII, Proposition 2 |publisher=Aleph0.clarku.edu |date= |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}</ref> uses 3009 and 884. Knuth suggested 40902, 24140. Another interesting case is the two [[relatively prime]] numbers 14157 and 5950.\n\nBut exceptional cases must be identified and tested. Will \"Inelegant\" perform properly when R > S, S > R, R = S? Ditto for \"Elegant\": B > A, A > B, A = B? (Yes to all). What happens when one number is zero, both numbers are zero? (\"Inelegant\" computes forever in all cases; \"Elegant\" computes forever when A = 0.) What happens if ''negative'' numbers are entered? Fractional numbers? If the input numbers, i.e. the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of the function computed by the algorithm/program, is to include only positive integers including zero, then the failures at zero indicate that the algorithm (and the program that [[instance (computer science)|instantiates]] it) is a [[partial function]] rather than a [[total function]]. A notable failure due to exceptions is the [[Ariane 5 Flight 501]] rocket failure (4 June 1996).\n\n''Proof of program correctness by use of mathematical induction'': Knuth demonstrates the application of [[mathematical induction]] to an \"extended\" version of Euclid's algorithm, and he proposes \"a general method applicable to proving the validity of any algorithm\".<ref>Knuth 1973:13\u201318. He credits \"the formulation of algorithm-proving in terms of asertions and induction\" to R. W. Floyd, Peter Naur, C. A. R. Hoare, H. H. Goldstine and J. von Neumann. Tausworth 1977 borrows Knuth's Euclid example and extends Knuth's method in section 9.1 ''Formal Proofs'' (pages 288\u2013298).</ref> Tausworthe proposes that a measure of the complexity of a program be the length of its correctness proof.<ref>Tausworthe 1997:294</ref>\n\n=== Measuring and improving the Euclid algorithms ===\n''Elegance (compactness) versus goodness (speed)'': With only six core instructions, \"Elegant\" is the clear winner, compared to \"Inelegant\" at thirteen instructions. However, \"Inelegant\" is ''faster'' (it arrives at HALT in fewer steps). [[Algorithm analysis]]<ref>cf Knuth 1973:7 (Vol. I), and his more-detailed analyses on pp. 1969:294\u2013313 (Vol II).</ref> indicates why this is the case: \"Elegant\" does ''two'' conditional tests in every subtraction loop, whereas \"Inelegant\" only does one. As the algorithm (usually) requires many loop-throughs, ''on average'' much time is wasted doing a \"B = 0?\" test that is needed only after the remainder is computed.\n\n''Can the algorithms be improved?'': Once the programmer judges a program \"fit\" and \"effective\"\u2014that is, it computes the function intended by its author\u2014then the question becomes, can it be improved?\n\nThe compactness of \"Inelegant\" can be improved by the elimination of five steps. But Chaitin proved that compacting an algorithm cannot be automated by a generalized algorithm;<ref>Breakdown occurs when an algorithm tries to compact itself. Success would solve the [[Halting problem]].</ref> rather, it can only be done [[heuristic]]ally; i.e., by exhaustive search (examples to be found at [[Busy beaver]]), trial and error, cleverness, insight, application of [[inductive reasoning]], etc. Observe that steps 4, 5 and 6 are repeated in steps 11, 12 and 13. Comparison with \"Elegant\" provides a hint that these steps, together with steps 2 and 3, can be eliminated. This reduces the number of core instructions from thirteen to eight, which makes it \"more elegant\" than \"Elegant\", at nine steps.\n\nThe speed of \"Elegant\" can be improved by moving the \"B=0?\" test outside of the two subtraction loops. This change calls for the addition of three instructions (B = 0?, A = 0?, GOTO). Now \"Elegant\" computes the example-numbers faster; whether this is always the case for any given A, B and R, S would require a detailed analysis.\n\n== Algorithmic analysis ==\n{{Main article|Analysis of algorithms}}\nIt is frequently important to know how much of a particular resource (such as time or storage) is theoretically required for a given algorithm. Methods have been developed for the [[analysis of algorithms]] to obtain such quantitative answers (estimates); for example, the sorting algorithm above has a time requirement of O(''n''), using the [[big O notation]] with ''n'' as the length of the list. At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the largest number found so far, and its current position in the input list. Therefore, it is said to have a space requirement of ''O(1)'', if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted, or O(''n'') if it is counted.\n\nDifferent algorithms may  complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time, space, or '[[algorithmic efficiency|effort]]' than others. For example, a [[binary search]] algorithm (with cost O(log n) ) outperforms a sequential search (cost O(n) ) when used for [[lookup table|table lookup]]s on sorted lists or arrays.\n\n=== Formal versus empirical ===\n{{Main article|Empirical algorithmics|Profiling (computer programming)|Program optimization}}\nThe [[analysis of algorithms|analysis and study of algorithms]] is a discipline of [[computer science]], and is often practiced abstractly without the use of a specific [[programming language]] or implementation. In this sense, algorithm analysis resembles other mathematical disciplines in that it focuses on the underlying properties of the algorithm and not on the specifics of any particular implementation. Usually [[pseudocode]] is used for analysis as it is the simplest and most general representation. However, ultimately, most algorithms are usually implemented on particular hardware / software platforms and their [[algorithmic efficiency]] is eventually put to the test using real code. For the solution of a \"one off\" problem, the efficiency of a particular algorithm may not have significant consequences (unless n is extremely large) but for algorithms designed for fast interactive, commercial or long life scientific usage it may be critical. Scaling from small n to large n frequently exposes inefficient algorithms that are otherwise benign.\n\nEmpirical testing is useful because it may  uncover unexpected interactions that affect performance. [[Benchmark (computing)|Benchmark]]s may  be used to compare before/after potential improvements to an algorithm after program optimization.\n\n=== Execution efficiency ===\n{{Main article|Algorithmic efficiency}}\nTo illustrate the potential improvements possible even in well established algorithms, a recent significant innovation, relating to [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]] algorithms (used heavily in the field of image processing), can decrease processing time up to 1,000 times for applications like medical imaging.<ref>{{cite web| title=Better Math Makes Faster Data Networks| author=Gillian Conahan| date=January 2013| url=http://discovermagazine.com/2013/jan-feb/34-better-math-makes-faster-data-networks#.URAnVieX98F| publisher=discovermagazine.com}}</ref> In general, speed improvements depend on special properties of the problem, which are very common in practical applications.<ref name=\"Hassanieh12\">Haitham Hassanieh, [[Piotr Indyk]], Dina Katabi, and Eric Price, \"[http://siam.omnibooksonline.com/2012SODA/data/papers/500.pdf ACM-SIAM Symposium On Discrete Algorithms (SODA)], Kyoto, January 2012.  See also the [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/netmit/sFFT/ sFFT Web Page].</ref> Speedups of this magnitude enable computing devices that make extensive use of image processing (like digital cameras and medical equipment) to consume less power.\n\n== Classification ==\nThere are various ways to classify algorithms, each with its own merits.\n\n=== By implementation ===\nOne way to classify algorithms is by implementation means.\n\n; Recursion\n: A [[recursive algorithm]] is one that invokes (makes reference to) itself repeatedly until a certain condition (also known as termination condition) matches, which is a method common to [[functional programming]]. [[Iteration|Iterative]] algorithms use repetitive constructs like [[Program loops|loops]] and sometimes additional data structures like [[Stack (data structure)|stacks]] to solve the given problems. Some problems are naturally suited for one implementation or the other. For example, [[towers of Hanoi]] is well understood using recursive implementation. Every recursive version has an equivalent (but possibly more or less complex) iterative version, and vice versa.\n; Logical\n: An algorithm may  be viewed as controlled [[Deductive reasoning|logical deduction]]. This notion may  be expressed as: ''Algorithm = logic + control''.<ref>Kowalski 1979</ref> The logic component expresses the axioms that may  be used in the computation and the control component determines the way in which deduction is applied to the axioms. This is the basis for the [[logic programming]] paradigm. In pure logic programming languages the control component is fixed and algorithms are specified by supplying only the logic component. The appeal of this approach is the elegant [[Formal semantics of programming languages|semantics]]: a change in the axioms has a well-defined change in the algorithm.\n; Serial, parallel or distributed\n: Algorithms are usually discussed with the assumption that computers execute one instruction of an algorithm at a time. Those computers are sometimes called serial computers. An [[algorithm design]]ed for such an environment is called a serial algorithm, as opposed to [[parallel algorithm]]s or [[distributed algorithms]]. Parallel algorithms take advantage of computer architectures where several processors can work on a problem at the same time, whereas distributed algorithms utilize multiple machines connected with a [[Computer Network|network]]. Parallel or distributed algorithms divide the problem into more symmetrical or asymmetrical subproblems and collect the results back together. The resource consumption in such algorithms is not only processor cycles on each processor but also the communication overhead between the processors. Some sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently, but their communication overhead is expensive. Iterative algorithms are generally parallelizable. Some problems have no parallel algorithms, and are called inherently serial problems.\n; Deterministic or non-deterministic\n: [[Deterministic algorithm]]s solve the problem with exact decision at every step of the algorithm whereas [[non-deterministic algorithm]]s solve problems via guessing although typical guesses are made more accurate through the use of [[heuristics]].\n; Exact or approximate\n: While many algorithms reach an exact solution, [[approximation algorithm]]s seek an approximation that is close to the true solution. Approximation may  use either a deterministic or a random strategy. Such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems.\n; [[Quantum algorithm]]\n: They run on a realistic model of [[quantum computation]]. The term is usually used for those algorithms which seem inherently quantum, or use some essential feature of quantum computation such as [[quantum superposition]] or [[quantum entanglement]].\n\n=== By design paradigm ===\nAnother way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm. There is a certain number of paradigms, each different from the other. Furthermore, each of these categories include many different types of algorithms. Some common paradigms are:\n\n; [[Brute force search|Brute-force]] or exhaustive search\n: This is the naive method of trying every possible solution to see which is best.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Carroll| first1 = Sue| last2 = Daughtrey| first2 = Taz| title = Fundamental Concepts for the Software Quality Engineer| url = https://books.google.com/?id=bz_cl3B05IcC&pg=PA282| date = July 4, 2007| publisher = American Society for Quality| isbn = 978-0-87389-720-4| pages = 282 et seq. }}</ref>\n; Divide and conquer\n: A [[divide and conquer algorithm]] repeatedly reduces an instance of a problem to one or more smaller instances of the same problem (usually [[recursion|recursively]]) until the instances are small enough to solve easily. One such example of divide and conquer is [[mergesort|merge sorting]]. Sorting can be done on each segment of data after dividing data into segments and sorting of entire data can be obtained in the conquer phase by merging the segments. A simpler variant of divide and conquer is called a ''decrease and conquer algorithm'', that solves an identical subproblem and uses the solution of this subproblem to solve the bigger problem. Divide and conquer divides the problem into multiple subproblems and so the conquer stage is more complex than decrease and conquer algorithms. An example of decrease and conquer algorithm is the [[binary search algorithm]].\n; Search and enumeration\n: Many problems (such as playing [[chess]]) can be modeled as problems on [[graph theory|graphs]]. A [[graph exploration algorithm]] specifies rules for moving around a graph and is useful for such problems. This category also includes [[search algorithm]]s, [[branch and bound]] enumeration and [[backtracking]].\n;[[Randomized algorithm]]\n: Such algorithms make some choices randomly (or pseudo-randomly). They can be very useful in finding approximate solutions for problems where finding exact solutions can be impractical (see heuristic method below). For some of these problems, it is known that the fastest approximations must involve some [[randomness]].<ref>For instance, the [[volume]] of a [[convex polytope]] (described using a membership oracle) can be approximated to high accuracy by a randomized polynomial time algorithm, but not by a deterministic one: see {{citation\n | last1 = Dyer | first1 = Martin\n | last2 = Frieze | first2 = Alan\n | last3 = Kannan | first3 = Ravi\n | date = January 1991\n | doi = 10.1145/102782.102783\n | issue = 1\n | journal = J. ACM\n | location = New York, NY, USA\n | pages = 1\u201317\n | publisher = ACM\n | title = A Random Polynomial-time Algorithm for Approximating the Volume of Convex Bodies\n | volume = 38}}.</ref> Whether randomized algorithms with [[P (complexity)|polynomial time complexity]] can be the fastest algorithms for some problems is an open question known as the [[P versus NP problem]]. There are two large classes of such algorithms:\n# [[Monte Carlo algorithm]]s return a correct answer with high-probability. E.g. [[RP (complexity)|RP]] is the subclass of these that run in [[polynomial time]].\n# [[Las Vegas algorithm]]s always return the correct answer, but their running time is only probabilistically bound, e.g. [[Zero-error Probabilistic Polynomial time|ZPP]].\n; [[Reduction (complexity)|Reduction of complexity]]\n: This technique involves solving a difficult problem by transforming it into a better known problem for which we have (hopefully) [[asymptotically optimal]] algorithms. The goal is to find a reducing algorithm whose [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] is not dominated by the resulting reduced algorithm's. For example, one [[selection algorithm]] for finding the median in an unsorted list involves first sorting the list (the expensive portion) and then pulling out the middle element in the sorted list (the cheap portion).  This technique is also known as ''transform and conquer''.\n\n=== Optimization problems ===\n\nFor [[optimization problem]]s there is a more specific classification of algorithms; an algorithm for such problems may fall into one or more of the general categories described above as well as into one of the following:\n\n; [[Linear programming]]\n: When searching for optimal solutions to a linear function bound to linear equality and inequality constraints, the constraints of the problem can be used directly in producing the optimal solutions. There are algorithms that can solve any problem in this category, such as the popular [[simplex algorithm]].<ref>\n[[George B. Dantzig]] and Mukund N. Thapa. 2003. ''Linear Programming 2: Theory and Extensions''. Springer-Verlag.</ref> Problems that can be solved with linear programming include the [[maximum flow problem]] for directed graphs. If a problem additionally requires that one or more of the unknowns must be an [[integer]] then it is classified in [[integer programming]]. A linear programming algorithm can solve such a problem if it can be proved that all restrictions for integer values are superficial, i.e., the solutions satisfy these restrictions anyway. In the general case, a specialized algorithm or an algorithm that finds approximate solutions is used, depending on the difficulty of the problem.\n; [[Dynamic programming]]\n: When a problem shows [[optimal substructure]]s \u2014 meaning the optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems \u2014 and [[overlapping subproblems]], meaning the same subproblems are used to solve many different problem instances, a quicker approach called ''dynamic programming'' avoids recomputing solutions that have already been computed. For example, [[Floyd\u2013Warshall algorithm]], the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a weighted [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] can be found by using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices. Dynamic programming and [[memoization]] go together. The main difference between dynamic programming and divide and conquer is that subproblems are more or less independent in divide and conquer, whereas subproblems overlap in dynamic programming. The difference between dynamic programming and straightforward recursion is in caching or memoization of recursive calls. When subproblems are independent and there is no repetition, memoization does not help; hence dynamic programming is not a solution for all complex problems. By using memoization or maintaining a [[Mathematical table|table]] of subproblems already solved, dynamic programming reduces the exponential nature of many problems to polynomial complexity.\n; The greedy method\n: A [[greedy algorithm]] is similar to a dynamic programming algorithm in that it works by examining substructures, in this case not of the problem but of a given solution. Such algorithms start with some solution, which may be given or have been constructed in some way, and improve it by making small modifications. For some problems they can find the optimal solution while for others they stop at [[local optimum|local optima]], that is, at solutions that cannot be improved by the algorithm but are not optimum. The most popular use of greedy algorithms is for finding the minimal spanning tree where finding the optimal solution is possible with this method. [[Huffman coding|Huffman Tree]], [[kruskal's algorithm|Kruskal]], [[Prim's algorithm|Prim]], [[Sollin's algorithm|Sollin]] are greedy algorithms that can solve this optimization problem.\n;The heuristic method\n:In [[optimization problem]]s, [[heuristic algorithm]]s can be used to find a solution close to the optimal solution in cases where finding the optimal solution is impractical. These algorithms work by getting closer and closer to the optimal solution as they progress. In principle, if run for an infinite amount of time, they will find the optimal solution. Their merit is that they can find a solution very close to the optimal solution in a relatively short time. Such algorithms include [[local search (optimization)|local search]], [[tabu search]], [[simulated annealing]], and [[genetic algorithm]]s. Some of them, like simulated annealing, are non-deterministic algorithms while others, like tabu search, are deterministic. When a bound on the error of the non-optimal solution is known, the algorithm is further categorized as an [[approximation algorithm]].\n\n=== By field of study ===\n{{See also|List of algorithms}}\nEvery field of science has its own problems and needs efficient algorithms. Related problems in one field are often studied together. Some example classes are [[search algorithm]]s, [[sorting algorithm]]s, [[merge algorithm]]s, [[numerical analysis|numerical algorithms]], [[graph theory|graph algorithms]], [[string algorithms]], [[computational geometry|computational geometric algorithms]], [[combinatorial|combinatorial algorithms]], [[medical algorithm]]s, [[machine learning]], [[cryptography]], [[data compression]] algorithms and [[parsing|parsing techniques]].\n\nFields tend to overlap with each other, and algorithm advances in one field may  improve those of other, sometimes completely unrelated, fields. For example, dynamic programming was invented for optimization of resource consumption in industry, but is now used in solving a broad range of problems in many fields.\n\n=== By complexity ===\n{{See also|Complexity class| Parameterized complexity}}\nAlgorithms can be classified by the amount of time they need to complete compared to their input size:\n\n* Constant time: if the time needed by the algorithm is the same, regardless of the input size. E.g. an access to an [[Array data structure|array]] element.\n* Linear time: if the time is proportional to the input size. E.g. the traverse of a list.\n* Logarithmic time: if the time is a logarithmic function of the input size. E.g. [[binary search algorithm]].\n* Polynomial time: if the time is a power of the input size. E.g. the [[bubble sort]] algorithm has quadratic time complexity.\n* Exponential time: if the time is an exponential function of the input size. E.g. [[Brute-force search]].\n\nSome problems may have multiple algorithms of differing complexity, while other problems might have no algorithms or no known efficient algorithms. There are also mappings from some problems to other problems. Owing to this, it was found to be more suitable to classify the problems themselves instead of the algorithms into equivalence classes based on the complexity of the best possible algorithms for them.\n\n== Continuous algorithms ==\nThe adjective \"continuous\" when applied to the word \"algorithm\" can mean:\n* An algorithm operating on data that represents continuous quantities, even though this data is represented by discrete approximations\u2014such algorithms are studied in [[numerical analysis]]; or\n* An algorithm in the form of a [[differential equation]] that operates continuously on the data, running on an [[analog computer]].<ref>{{cite book| author = Tsypkin| title = Adaptation and learning in automatic systems| url = https://books.google.com/?id=sgDHJlafMskC&pg=PA54| year = 1971| publisher = Academic Press| isbn = 978-0-08-095582-7| page = 54 }}</ref>\n\n== Legal issues ==\n:''See also: [[Software patents]] for a general overview of the patentability of software, including computer-implemented algorithms.''\n\nAlgorithms, by themselves, are not usually patentable. In the United States, a claim consisting solely of simple manipulations of abstract concepts, numbers, or signals does not constitute \"processes\" (USPTO 2006), and hence algorithms are not patentable (as in [[Gottschalk v. Benson]]). However, practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable. For example, in [[Diamond v.

The problem solver or worker is to move and work in this symbol space, being capable of being in, and operating in but one box at a time.... a box is to admit of but two possible conditions, i.e., being empty or unmarked, and having a single mark in it, say a vertical stroke.\n\n:\"One box is to be singled out and called the starting point. ...a specific problem is to be given in symbolic form by a finite number of boxes [i.e., INPUT] being marked with a stroke. Likewise the answer [i.e., OUTPUT] is to be given in symbolic form by such a configuration of marked boxes....\n\n:\"A set of directions applicable to a general problem sets up a deterministic process when applied to each specific problem.

But he continues a step further and creates a machine as a model of computation of numbers.<ref>Turing 1936\u20137:116</ref>\n\n:\"Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper. We may  suppose this paper is divided into squares like a child's arithmetic book....I assume then that the computation is carried out on one-dimensional paper, i.e., on a tape divided into squares. I shall also suppose that the number of symbols which may  be printed is finite....\n\n:\"The behaviour of the computer at any moment is determined by the symbols which he is observing, and his \"state of mind\" at that moment. We may  suppose that there is a bound B to the number of symbols or squares which the computer can observe at one moment. If he wishes to observe more, he must use successive observations. We will also suppose that the number of states of mind which need be taken into account is finite...\n\n:\"Let us imagine that the operations performed by the computer to be split up into 'simple operations' which are so elementary that it is not easy to imagine them further divided.\"<ref name=\"Turing 1936\u20137 in Davis 1965:136\">Turing 1936\u20137 in Davis 1965:136</ref>\n\nTuring's reduction yields the following:\n:\"The simple operations must therefore include:\n::\"(a) Changes of the symbol on one of the observed squares\n::\"(b) Changes of one of the squares observed to another square within L squares of one of the previously observed squares.\n\"It may  be that some of these change necessarily invoke a change of state of mind.

Though it is fairly easy to get an intuitive grasp of this idea, it is nevertheless desirable to have some more definite, mathematical expressible definition . . . [he discusses the history of the definition pretty much as presented above with respect to G\u00f6del, Herbrand, Kleene, Church, Turing and Post] . . . We may  take this statement literally, understanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine. It is possible to give a mathematical description, in a certain normal form, of the structures of these machines. The development of these ideas leads to the author's definition of a computable function, and to an identification of computability \u2020 with effective calculability . . . .\n::\"\u2020 We shall use the expression \"computable function\" to mean a function calculable by a machine, and we let \"effectively calculable\" refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions\".<ref>Turing 1939 in Davis 1965:160</ref>\n\n=== J. B. Rosser (1939) and S. C. Kleene (1943) ===\n''[[J. Barkley Rosser]]'' defined an 'effective [mathematical] method' in the following manner (italicization added):\n:\"'Effective method' is used here in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely determined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps. With this special meaning, three different precise definitions have been given to date. [his footnote #5; see discussion immediately below]. The simplest of these to state (due to Post and Turing) says essentially that ''an effective method of solving certain sets of problems exists if one can build a machine which will then solve any problem of the set with no human intervention beyond inserting the question and (later) reading the answer''. All three definitions are equivalent, so it doesn't matter which one is used. Moreover, the fact that all three are equivalent is a very strong argument for the correctness of any one.\" (Rosser 1939:225\u20136)\n\nRosser's footnote #5 references the work of (1) Church and Kleene and their definition of \u03bb-definability, in particular Church's use of it in his ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'' (1936); (2) Herbrand and G\u00f6del and their use of recursion in particular G\u00f6del's use in his famous paper ''On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I'' (1931); and (3) Post (1936) and Turing (1936\u20137) in their mechanism-models of computation.\n\n''[[Stephen C. Kleene]]'' defined as his now-famous \"Thesis I\" known as the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis]]. But he did this in the following context (boldface in original):\n:\"12. ''Algorithmic theories''... In setting up a complete algorithmic theory, what we do is to describe a procedure, performable for each set of values of the independent variables, which procedure necessarily terminates and in such manner that from the outcome we can read a definite answer, \"yes\" or \"no,\" to the question, \"is the predicate value true?\"\" (Kleene 1943:273)\n\n=== History after 1950 ===\nA number of efforts have been directed toward further refinement of the definition of \"algorithm\", and activity is on-going because of issues surrounding, in particular, [[foundations of mathematics]] (especially the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis]]) and [[philosophy of mind]] (especially arguments about [[artificial intelligence]]).
