The word originates from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''loco'' \u2013 \"from a place\", [[Ablative case|ablative]] of ''locus'', \"place\" + Medieval Latin ''motivus'', \"causing motion\", and is a shortened form of the term ''locomotive engine'',<ref>{{cite web | title = Locomotive | work = (etymology) | publisher = Online Etymology Dictionary | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=locomotive | accessdate = 2 June 2008}}</ref> first used in the early 19th century to distinguish between mobile and [[stationary steam engine]]s.\n\nA locomotive has no ''payload capacity'' of its own, and its sole purpose is to move the train along the tracks.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts/towing/towing-capacity/vehicle/payload1.htm | title = How Payload Works | publisher = Auto.howstuffworks.com | access-date = 2014-01-31}}</ref> In contrast, some trains have self-propelled payload-carrying vehicles. These are not normally considered locomotives, and may be referred to as [[multiple unit]]s, [[Rail motor coach|motor coaches]] or [[railcar]]s. The use of these self-propelled vehicles is increasingly common for [[passenger train]]s, but rare for [[freight]] (see [[CargoSprinter]]). Vehicles which provide motive power to haul an unpowered train, but are not generally considered locomotives because they have payload space or are rarely detached from their trains, are known as [[power car]]s.\n\nTraditionally, locomotives pulled trains from the front. However, [[Push-pull train|push-pull]] operation has become common, where the train may have a locomotive (or locomotives) at the front, at the rear, or at each end.\n__TOC__\n\n==Origins==\n{{See also|History of rail transport|:Category:Early steam locomotives|l2=Category:Early steam locomotives}}\n[[File:Invicta anagoria.JPG|left|thumb|Trevithick's 1804 locomotive]]\n\nPrior to locomotives, the motive force for railroads had been generated by various lower-technology methods such as human power, horse power, [[Gravity railroad|gravity]] or stationary engines that drove cable systems.\n\nThe first successful locomotives were built by [[Cornwall|Cornish]] inventor [[Richard Trevithick]]. In 1804 his unnamed [[steam locomotive]] hauled a train along the [[Rail transport|tramway]] of the [[Penydarren]] ironworks, near [[Merthyr Tydfil]] in [[Wales]]. Although the locomotive hauled a train of {{convert|10|LT|ST t|1}} of iron and 70 passengers in five wagons over {{convert|9|mi|km|spell=in}}, it was too heavy for the [[cast iron]] rails used at the time. The locomotive only ran three trips before it was abandoned. Trevithick built a series of locomotives after the Penydarren experiment, including one which ran at a colliery in Tyneside in northern England, where it was seen by the young [[George Stephenson]].<ref name=\"PER_TREV\">Ellis, p. 12</ref>\n\nThe first commercially successful steam locomotive was [[Matthew Murray]]'s [[rack railway|rack]] locomotive, ''[[The Salamanca|Salamanca]]'', built for the [[narrow gauge railways|narrow gauge]] [[Middleton Railway]] in 1812. This was followed in 1813 by the ''[[Puffing Billy (locomotive)|Puffing Billy]]'' built by Christopher Blackett and [[William Hedley]] for the Wylam Colliery Railway, the first successful locomotive running by [[rail adhesion|adhesion]] only. Puffing Billy is now on display in the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in [[London]], the oldest locomotive in existence.<ref>Ellis, pp. 20\u201322</ref>\n\nIn 1814 [[George Stephenson]], inspired by the early locomotives of Trevithick and Hedley persuaded the manager of the [[Killingworth]] [[Coal mining|colliery]] where he worked to allow him to build a [[Steam engine|steam-powered]] machine. He built the ''[[Bl\u00fccher (locomotive)|Bl\u00fccher]]'', one of the first successful [[flange]]d-wheel adhesion locomotives. Stephenson played a pivotal role in the development and widespread adoption of steam locomotives. His designs improved on the work of the pioneers. In 1825 he built the ''[[Locomotion No 1|Locomotion]]'' for the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]], north east England, which became the first public steam railway. In 1829 he built ''[[Stephenson's Rocket|The Rocket]]'' which was entered in and won the [[Rainhill Trials]]. This success led to Stephenson establishing his company as the pre-eminent builder of steam locomotives used on railways in the United Kingdom, the United States and much of Europe.<ref>Ellis, pp. 24\u201330</ref> The first inter city passenger railway, [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], opened in 1830, making exclusive use of steam power for both passenger and freight trains.\n\n==Comparison to multiple units (MU)==\n{{Textbook|date=April 2009}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2011}}\n\n===Advantages of locomotives===\n[[File:NorthEasternRailwayNo1-Locomotion-Shildon-April2008.JPG|thumb|An early design of [[electric locomotive]] showing the [[steeplecab]] arrangement: [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]] [[British Rail Class ES1|No.1]], England from 1905]]\n\nThere are a few basic reasons to isolate locomotive train power, as compared to [[Multiple unit|self-propelled vehicles]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-technical.com/tr-ops.shtml |title=Comparison of locomotive hauled and multiple unit trains}}</ref>\n\n; Ease : Whether out of necessity to replace the locomotive due to failure, or for reason of needing to maintain the power unit, it is relatively easy to replace the locomotive with another, while not removing the entire train from service.\n; Maximum utilization of power cars: Separate locomotives facilitate movement of costly motive power assets as needed; thereby avoiding the expense associated with tied up or idle power resources.\n; Flexibility : Large locomotives can substitute for small locomotives when more power is required, for example, where grades are steeper. As needed, a locomotive can be used for either freight duties, or passenger service.\n; Obsolescence cycles : Separating motive power from payload-hauling cars enables replacement without affecting the other. To illustrate, locomotives might become obsolete when their associated cars did not, and vice versa.\n; Safety : In an accident, the locomotive may act as a buffer zone to the rest of the train. Depending on the obstacle encountered on the rail line, the heavier mass of a locomotive is less likely to deviate from its normal course. In the event of fire, it might be safer, for example, with diesel locomotives.\n; Noise : A single source of tractive power (i.e., motors in one place), is quieter than multiple operational power units, where one or more motors are located under every carriage. The noise problem is particularly noticeable in [[diesel multiple unit]]s.\n;Saves time : The motive power accompanies the cars to be hauled and consequently there is a saving in time.\n; Maintenance : Especially for steam locomotives but also for other types, maintenance facilities can be very dirty environments and it is advantageous not to have to take passenger accommodation into the same depot.  This was one reason for the demise of the [[Great Western Railway|GWR]] steam [[railmotor]]s.\n\n===Advantages of multiple units===\nThere are several advantages of [[multiple unit]] (MU) trains compared to locomotives.\n\n; Energy efficiency : [[Multiple unit]]s are more energy efficient than locomotive-hauled trains and more nimble, especially on down grades, as much more of the train's weight (sometimes all of it) is placed on driven wheels, rather than suffering the dead weight of unpowered coaches.\n; No need to turn the locomotive : Many multiple units have cabs at both ends; therefore, the train may be reversed without uncoupling/re-coupling the locomotive, providing quicker turnaround times, reduced crew costs, and enhanced safety. In practice, the development of [[Driving Van Trailer|driving van trailers]] and [[Control car (rail)|cab cars]] has removed the need for locomotives to run-around, giving easy bi-directional operation and removing this MU advantage.\n; Reliability : Multiple unit trains have multiple engines, where the failure of one engine usually does not prevent the train from continuing on its journey. A locomotive drawn passenger [[train]] typically has only a single power unit; the failure of this single unit temporarily disables the train. However, as is often the case with locomotive hauled freight trains, some passenger trains utilize multiple locomotives, and are thus able to continue at reduced speed after the failure of one locomotive.\n\n==Locomotive classifications==\n{{see also|List of US locomotive types}}\n\n===Motive power===\nLocomotives may generate their power from fuel (wood, coal, petroleum or natural gas), or they may take [[Power (physics)|power]] from an outside source of electricity. It is common to classify locomotives by their source of energy. The common ones include:\n\n====Steam====\n{{Main|Steam locomotive}}\n[[File:Steam locomotive scheme new.png|thumb|right|The main [[Steam locomotive components|components of a steam locomotive]]]]\n[[File:Steam Locomotive.jpg|thumb|right|A steam locomotive at the [[Gare du Nord]], Paris, 1930]]\n[[File:Locomotora Miranda Spain.JPG|thumb|Locomotive 030-219 of [[Renfe]] in [[Miranda de Ebro]], Spain]]\nIn the 19th century the first railway locomotives were powered by [[steam engine|steam]], usually generated by burning wood, coal, or oil. Because steam locomotives included one or more steam engines, they are sometimes referred to as \"steam engines\". The steam locomotive remained by far the most common type of locomotive until after [[World War II]].<ref>Ellis, p. 355</ref>\n\nThe first steam locomotive was built by [[Richard Trevithick]]; it first ran on 21 February 1804, although it was some years before steam locomotive design became economically practical.<ref name=\"PER_TREV\" /> The first commercial use of a steam locomotive was ''[[Salamanca (locomotive)|Salamanca]]'' on the [[narrow gauge railways|narrow gauge]] [[Middleton Railway]] in [[Leeds]] in 1812. In the USA, Mathias Baldwin started building stationary steam engines for commercial use and by 1830, opened his own workshop producing steam locomotives. Baldwin Locomotive Works became the world's largest by the early 1900s and built the most powerful steam locos in history. The locomotive ''[[Fairy Queen (locomotive)|Fairy Queen]]'', built in 1855 runs between [[Delhi]] and [[Alwar]] in [[India]] and is the oldest steam locomotive in regular (albeit tourist-only) service in the world, and the oldest steam locomotive operating on a mainline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railmuseum.org/new_nrm/newstarexhibits/fairyReport.asp |title=Report on Fairy Queen |work=National Railway Museum of India |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908185239/http://www.railmuseum.org/new_nrm/newstarexhibits/fairyReport.asp |archivedate=8 September 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://historywired.si.edu/detail.cfm?ID=225 |title=John Bull Locomotive|work=History Wired}}</ref>\n\nThe all-time speed record for steam trains is held by an [[LNER Class A4]] [[Whyte notation|4-6-2]] [[4-6-2|Pacific]] locomotive of the [[LNER]] in the United Kingdom, number 4468 ''[[LNER 4468 Mallard|Mallard]]'', which pulling six carriages (plus a dynamometer car) reached {{convert|126|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on a slight downhill gradient down Stoke Bank on 3 July 1938.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lner.info/locos/A/a4.shtml |title=LNER Encyclopedia article on the Gresley A4}}</ref>  Aerodynamic passenger locomotives in Germany attained speeds very close to this and due to the difficulties of adequately balancing and lubricating the running gear, this is generally thought to be close to the practicable limit for a direct-coupled steam locomotive.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.db.de/site/bahn/en/db__group/db__museum/exhibitions/vehicles/05__001.html |title=Deutsche Bahn Museum article on the 05 001 locomotive}}</ref>\n\nBefore the middle of the 20th century, electric and diesel-electric locomotives began replacing steam locomotives. Steam locomotives are less efficient than their more modern diesel and electric counterparts and require much greater manpower to operate and service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mikes.railhistory.railfan.net/r085.html |title=Diesel Locomotives. The Construction of and Performance Obtained from the Oil Engine |year=1935}}</ref> [[British Rail]] figures showed the cost of crewing and fuelling a steam locomotive was some two and a half times that of diesel power, and the daily mileage achievable was far lower. As labour costs rose, particularly after the second world war, non-steam technologies became much more cost-efficient.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  By the end of the 1960s\u20131970s, most western countries had completely replaced steam locomotives in passenger service. Freight locomotives generally were replaced later. Other designs, such as locomotives powered by gas turbines, have been experimented with, but have seen little use, mainly due to high fuel costs.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, almost the only steam power remaining in regular use in [[North America]] and Western [[Europe]]an countries was on [[heritage railways]]. These were largely aimed at tourists and/or railroad hobbyists, known as '[[railfan]]s' or 'railway enthusiasts'. An exception are the [[narrow gauge railways|narrow gauge]] lines in Germany, which form part of the public transport system, running to all-year-round timetables. These railways retain steam for all or part of their motive power. Steam locomotives remained in commercial use in parts of [[Mexico]] into the late 1970s. Steam locomotives were in regular use until 2004 in the [[People's Republic of China]], where [[coal]] is a much more abundant resource than [[petroleum]] for diesel fuel.  [[India]] switched over from steam-powered trains to electric and diesel-powered trains in the 1980s, except heritage trains. In some mountainous and high altitude rail lines, steam engines remain in use because they are less affected by reduced air pressure than diesel engines.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Steam locomotives remained in routine passenger use in [[South Africa]] until the late 1990s, but are now reserved to tourist trains. In [[Zimbabwe]] steam locomotives are still used on shunting duties around [[Bulawayo]] and on some regular freight services.\n\nAs of 2006, DLM AG (Switzerland) continues to manufacture new steam locomotives.<ref>[http://www.dlm-ag.ch DLM AG] website</ref>\n\n====Gasoline====\n{{Stub section|date=July 2012}}\nGasoline locomotives have been produced since the early 1900s.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,721190,00.html Gasoline locomotives].

Retrieved on 2012-01-01.</ref>\n\nIn 1916 Simplex petrol locomotives with 20-40&nbsp;hp motors and 4-wheel mechanical transmission began to be used on 600mm gauge trench railways on the [[Western Front (World War I)]]. One advantage of these machines was that they could operate closer to the front line than steam locomotives, the relative lack of exhaust helping to conceal their exact position.\n\nMany were sold off as surplus at the end of hostilities, finding work on small industrial railways. [[Motor Rail]] continued to manufacture and develop the design, alongside diesel engined variants.\n\nThe War Department also ordered larger petrol-electric locomotives from [[Dick, Kerr & Co.]] and [[British Westinghouse]] at the same time: These used a 45&nbsp;hp petrol engine driving a 500V generator.<ref>[http://meridianmodels.co.uk/mm16-dick-kerr.php]</ref>\n\n====Diesel====\n{{Main|Diesel locomotive}}\n[[File:Metra Locomotive EMD F40PHM-2.jpg|thumb|The [[EMD F40PH#Variants|EMD F40PHM-2]] uses a [[Diesel-electric transmission]] designed by [[Electro-Motive Diesel]].]]\nExperimental [[Diesel engine|diesel]]-powered locomotives were first built just after [[World War I]]. In the 1940s, they began to displace [[steam]] power on American railroads. Following the end of [[World War II]], diesel power began to appear on railroads in many countries. The significantly better economics of diesel operation triggered a dash to diesel power, a process known as [[Dieselization]]. By the late 1960s, few major railroads in North America, Europe and Oceania continued to operate steam locomotives, although significant numbers still existed outside these areas.\n\nAs is the case with any vehicle powered by an [[internal combustion engine]], diesel locomotives require a [[power transmission]] system to couple the output of the [[prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]] to the driving wheels. In the early days of diesel railroad propulsion development, [[Diesel-electric transmission|electric]], [[Hydrokinetic transmission|hydraulic]] and [[transmission (mechanics)|mechanical power transmission]] systems were all employed with varying degrees of success. Of the three, electric transmission has proven the most popular, and although diesel-hydraulic locomotives have certain advantages and are continuously used in some European countries, most modern Diesel-powered locomotives are diesel-electric.\n\nDiesel locomotives require considerably less maintenance than steam, with a corresponding reduction in the number of personnel needed to keep the fleet in service. The best steam locomotives spent an average of three to five days per month in the shop for routine maintenance and running repairs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Heavy overhauls were frequent, often involving removal of the [[boiler]] from the frame for major repairs. In contrast, a typical diesel locomotive requires no more than eight to ten hours of maintenance per month (maintenance intervals are 92 days or 184 days, depending upon a locomotive's age),{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and may run for decades between major overhauls.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nDiesel units do not pollute as much as steam trains;{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} modern units produce low levels of exhaust emissions. Diesel-electric locomotives are often fitted with \"[[dynamic brakes]]\" that use the traction motors as [[electrical generator]]s during braking to assist in controlling the speed of a train on a descending grade. This technology is similar to [[regenerative braking]] used in hybrid cars; the key difference is dynamic braking does not store the generated power, instead it is routed to resistors then converted into waste heat.\n\n=====Slug or drone=====\nA [[slug (railroad)|slug]] or drone locomotive is a non-powered unit attached to a [[diesel-electric locomotive]] to provide additional traction and braking capability. The slug has [[traction motor]]s but no engine. Power is supplied by the attached locomotive (known as a 'mother'). At slow speeds, a diesel-electric prime mover can produce more power than its own traction motors can use; an installed slug increases the number of traction motors available, thereby using the created power more effectively.\n\nSlugs are mainly used in rail yards for switching duties, in which case they are without a cab. Other slugs, designed for use on service trains, may be fitted with a cab, to enhance control, and also provide additional fuel storage for the mother locomotive. In recent years on service trains, conventional locomotives, remotely controlled from the lead locomotive configuration, have been used in place of slugs.\n\n[[CP Rail]] used a prototype drone locomotive system called [[LOCOTROL]], developed in the 1960s, which evolved into today's systems.\n\n====Electric====\n{{Main|Electric locomotive}}\n[[File:Fus\u00e9eElectrique.png|thumb|''[[Heilmann locomotive|Fus\u00e9e Electrique]]'' of 1893, body removed.

Brown (by then in partnership with [[Brown, Boveri & Cie|Walter Boveri]])  put these into service on the first electrified main line, the [[List of current systems for electric rail traction#Burgdorf-Thun Bahn|Burgdorf\u2014Thun line]], Switzerland, in 1899.

The first installation was on the [[Valtellina]] line, Italy, in 1902. Kand\u00f3 was the first who recognised that an electric train system can only be successful if it can use the electricity from public networks. After realising that, he also provided the means to build such a rail network by inventing a [[rotary phase converter]] suitable for locomotive usage.\n\nThe [[electric locomotive]] is supplied externally with electric power, either through an [[Overhead lines|overhead pickup]] or through a [[third rail]]. While the capital cost of electrifying track is high, electric trains and locomotives are capable of higher performance and lower operational costs than steam or diesel power.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  Electric locomotives, because they tend to be less technically complex than diesel-electric locomotives, are both easier and cheaper to maintain and have extremely long working lives, usually 40 to 50 years: the last unit of the Italian [[FS Class E626|E626 class]], introduced in 1928, was retired 71 years later, in 1999. There are many other examples of electric locomotives operating for more than half a century with minimal overhaul, and it is not unusual for electric locomotives to be operating close to their centenary.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The [[VR Group|Finnish State Railroad]] is planning to phase out the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-manufactured [[VR Class Sr1]] engines, operative since 1973, in 2024, at which time they will have been over fifty years in line service.\n\nA French [[TGV]] holds the [[Land speed record for railed vehicles|world speed record]] for the fastest wheeled train, having reached {{convert|574.8|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on 3 April 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/04/03/TGVspeedrecord.ap/index.html|title=French train breaks speed record |accessdate=10 January 2008 |last=Associated Press |date=4 April 2007 |work=cnn.com |publisher=CNN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407194558/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/04/03/TGVspeedrecord.ap/index.html |archivedate=7 April 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=aW23Aw20niIo&refer=europe| title=French TGV Sets Record, Reaching 357 Miles an Hour (Update2)|author1=Fouquet, Helene  |author2=Viscousi, Gregory |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher=Bloomberg| date=3 April 2007| accessdate=19 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nSome electric locomotives can also operate on [[battery (electricity)|battery]] power to enable short journeys or shunting on non-electrified lines or yards.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Battery-powered locomotives are used in mines and other underground locations where diesel fumes or smoke would endanger crews, and where external electricity supplies cannot be used due to the danger of sparks igniting flammable gas.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Battery locomotives are also used on many underground railways for maintenance operations, as they are required when operating in areas where the electricity supply has been temporarily disconnected.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\n====Hybrid locomotives====\n{{Main|Hybrid train}}\nIn addition to locomotives that use a fueled power source (e.g. an [[internal combustion engine]]), and an electrical engine,<ref>[http://www.railway-technical.com/diesel.shtml Batteries being generally used only to start ICE-engine, not as buffer].

Here, the battery acts as a [[rechargeable energy storage system|temporary energy store]], allowing, e.g., the implementation of [[regenerative braking]] and switching off of the hydrocarbon engine when idling, or stationary, (as used in automobiles such as the [[Prius|Toyota Prius]]).\n\n====Steam-diesel hybrid locomotives====\n{{main|Steam diesel hybrid locomotive}}\nBritain, Russia and Italy have tried steam-diesel hybrid locomotives, with limited success.\n\n====Gas turbine-electric====\n{{Main|Gas turbine train}}\n\nA [[gas turbine-electric locomotive]], or GTEL, is a locomotive that uses a [[gas turbine]] to drive an [[electrical generator]] or [[alternator]]. The turbine (similar to a [[turboshaft]] engine) drives an output shaft, which drives the alternator via a system of [[gear]]s. The produced electric current powers the [[traction motor]]s. This type of locomotive was first experimented with in 1920, reaching its peak in the 1950s to 1960s. A related development is the [[gas turbine locomotive]] in which the turbine drives the wheels without an intermediate electrical device, at the cost of mechanical complexity.\n\nCompared to a [[reciprocating engine]], a turbine is mechanically simpler and lighter, but a turbine is [[Fuel efficiency|efficient]] within a narrower range of [[rotational speed]]s than a reciprocating engine.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nGas turbine locomotives are very powerful, and very loud. [[Union Pacific Railroad]] operated the largest fleet of gas turbine-electric locomotives in the world, and was the only railroad to use them for hauling freight in regular service. Most other GTELs were built for small passenger trains; only a few have seen any real success in that role.\n\nAfter the [[1973 oil crisis]] and subsequent rise in fuel costs, gas turbine locomotives became uneconomical to operate. Subsequently, many were taken out of service, making this type of locomotive rare.\n\n====Fuel cell-electric====\n{{Main|Hydrail}}\nIn 2002 the first 3.6 tonne, 17&nbsp;kW [[hydrogen]] (fuel cell) -powered mining locomotive was demonstrated in [[Val-d'Or]], [[Quebec]]. In 2007 the educational mini-hydrail in [[Kaohsiung]], [[Taiwan]] went into service. The [[Railpower GG20B]] finally is another example of a fuel cell-electric locomotive.\n\n====Atomic-Electric====\nIn the early 1950s, '''Dr. Lyle Borst''' of Utah University, was given funding by various US railroad line and manufacturers to study the feasibility of an electric-drive locomotive, in which an onboard atomic reactor produced the steam to generate the electricity. At that time, the dangers of atomic power were not fully understood; Borst believed the major stumbling block was the price of uranium. With the Borst atomic locomotive, the center section would have a 200-ton reactor chamber and steel walls 5 feet thick to prevent releases of radioactivity in case of accidents. He estimated a cost to manufacture atomic locomotives with 7000 h.p. engines at approximately $1,200,000 each.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nd8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA86&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Q3YzT6TaKu2o0AHgjvW_Ag&ved=0CDMQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Atomic Locomotive Produces 7000 h.p.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1954, p. 86.</ref>  Consequently, trains with onboard nuclear generators were generally deemed unfeasible due to prohibitive costs.\n\n===Use===\n[[File:Andrew Barclay locomotive plaque.JPG|left|thumb|A brass [[Builder's plate|makers plaque]] from an Andrew Barclay locomotive of 1925.]]\nThe three main categories of locomotives are often subdivided in their usage in [[rail transport operations]]. There are [[passenger]] locomotives, [[freight]] locomotives and [[switcher]] (or shunting) locomotives. These categories determine the locomotive's combination of physical size, starting [[tractive effort]] and maximum permitted speed. Freight locomotives are normally designed to deliver high starting [[tractive effort]]\u2014needed to start trains that may weigh as much as {{convert|15,000|LT|ST t|0|lk=on}}\u2014and deliver sustained high power, at the sacrifice of maximum speed. Passenger locomotives develop less starting tractive effort but are able to operate at the high speeds demanded by passenger schedules. [[Mixed-traffic locomotive|Mixed traffic locomotives]] (US English: general purpose or road switcher locomotives) are built to provide elements of both requirements. They do not develop as much starting tractive effort as a freight unit but are able to haul heavier trains than a passenger engine.\n\nMost steam locomotives are reciprocating units, in which the pistons are coupled to the drivers (driving wheels) by means of connecting rods, with no intervening gearbox. Therefore, the combination of starting tractive effort and maximum speed is greatly influenced by the diameter of the drivers. Steam locomotives intended for freight service generally have relatively small diameter drivers, whereas passenger models have large diameter drivers (as large as {{convert|84|in|mm|0|disp=or}} in some cases).\n\nWith [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] and electric locomotives, the gear ratio between the [[traction motor]]s and [[axle]]s is what adapts the unit to freight or passenger service, although a passenger unit may include other features, such as [[head end power]] (also referred to as hotel power or electric train supply) or a [[steam generator (railroad)|steam generator]].\n\nSome locomotives are designed specifically to work [[steep grade railway]]s, and feature extensive additional braking mechanisms and sometimes rack and pinion. Steam locomotives built for steep [[Rack railway|rack and pinion railways]] frequently have the boiler tilted relative to the wheels, so that the boiler remains roughly level on steep grades.\n\n===Operational role {{anchor|role}}===\n<!-- This section copied from the {{oldid|Train engine|257804752|pre-merge version of train engine}}, which now redirects to the above anchor tag -- do not delete this comment or the anchor -->\n\nLocomotives occasionally work in a specific role, such as:\n* '''Train engine''' is the technical name for a locomotive attached to the front of a railway [[train]] to haul that train. Alternatively, where facilities exist for [[Push-pull train|push-pull]] operation, the train engine might be attached to the rear of the train;\n* [[Pilot engine]] \u2013 a locomotive attached in front of the train engine, to enable [[Double-heading]];\n* [[Banking engine]] \u2013 a locomotive temporarily assisting a train from the rear, due to a difficult start or a sharp incline gradient;\n* [[Light engine]] \u2013 a locomotive operating without a train behind it, for relocation or operational reasons.\n* [[Station pilot]] \u2013 a locomotive used to shunt passenger trains at a railway station.\n\n===Wheel arrangement===\n{{Main|Wheel arrangement}}\n\nWheel arrangement is one type of classification. Common methods include the [[AAR wheel arrangement]], [[UIC classification]], and [[Whyte notation]] systems.\n\n===Remote control locomotives===\n{{Main|Remote control locomotive}}\nIn the second half of the twentieth century [[remote control locomotive]]s started to enter service in switching operations, being [[Remote control|remotely controlled]] by an operator outside of the locomotive cab.\nThe main benefit is one operator can control the loading of grain, coal, gravel, etc. into the cars. In addition, the same operator can move the train as needed. Thus, the locomotive is loaded or unloaded in about a third of the time.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n==Locomotives in numismatics==\nLocomotives have been a subject for collectors' coins and medals. One of the most famous and recent ones is the 25 euro [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2004 coinage|150 Years Semmering Alpine Railway commemorative coin]]. The obverse shows two locomotives: a historical and a modern one. This represents the technical development in locomotive construction between the years 1854 and 2004. The upper half depicts the \u201c[[Taurus train|Taurus]]\u201d, a high performance locomotive. Below is shown the first functional Alpine locomotive, the [[Engerth locomotive|Engerth]]; constructed by [[Wilhelm Freiherr von Engerth]].\n\n==Image gallery==\n<gallery style=\"text-align:left\" mode=packed widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\">\nImage:Ambarawa locomotief.jpg|Steam locomotive B-5112 in [[Ambarawa Railway Museum]], Indonesia\nFile:Steam engine, Centennial Park, Nashville, TN, US.jpg|In [[Centennial Park (Nashville)|Centennial Park]], Nashville, TN\nImage:Indian Diesel Loco.JPG|[[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A]] diesel locomotive of Indian Railways at [[Shantiniketan]], [[India]]\nImage:Talgo 350.jpg|Spanish modern electric locomotive with Talgo cars; [[AVE Class 102]] type train\nImage:BN 3157 IL Eola.jpg|[[EMD GP50]] diesel-electric freight locomotive of the [[Burlington Northern Railroad]]\nImage:SwissMGB.jpg|Swiss Electric Locomotive at [[Brig, Switzerland]], note the Alps at top right corner\nImage:E 626.JPG|[[FS Class E626|Italian E.626]] now in the National Museum of Transportation at [[La Spezia]]\nImage:GE Genesis number 31.png|[[GE Genesis|General Electric Genesis]] units are currently [[Amtrak]]'s main locomotives.\nImage:M2loco.jpg|[[EMD G12]] diesel electric passenger and freight locomotive of [[Sri Lanka Railways]], [[Sri Lanka]]\nImage:JRW_yuuyuusaronokayama_EF65PF_20090628.jpg|[[JNR Class EF65|EF65]] electric passenger and freight locomotive of [[West Japan Railway Company]] at [[Okayama Prefecture|Okayama]], [[Japan]]\nFile:Norfolk Southern locomotives.jpg|Two [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] locomotives\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Trains}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[Air brake (rail)|Air brake]]\n* [[Articulated locomotive]]\n* [[Autorail]]\n* [[Bank engine]]\n* [[Builder's plate]]\n* [[Control car (rail)]]\n* [[Duplex locomotive]]\n* [[Electric multiple unit]]\n* [[Headboard (train)]]\n* [[Headstock (rolling stock)]]\n* [[Kry\u0161p\u00edn's system]]\n* [[List of locomotive builders]]\n* [[List of locomotives]]\n* [[Trains in art|Locomotives in art]]\n* [[Brake (railway)|Railway brakes]]\n* [[Regenerative brake|Regenerative (dynamic) brakes]]\n* [[Train horn]]\n* [[Vacuum brake]]\n* [[World's largest locomotive]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |title=The Pictorial Encyclopedia of Railways |author=Ellis, Hamilton |publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group |year=1968}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Locomotives}}\n* [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/11164 An engineer's guide from 1891]\n* [http://freevst.x10.mx/sakhalia_net/history_railway/locomotive_cutaways.htm Locomotive cutaways and historical locomotives of several countries ordered by dates]\n* Pickzone Locomotive [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5Av-LamRJaRbXZXaFYwYVlPREE/view?usp=sharing Model]\n* [http://www.steam.dial.pipex.com/ International Steam Locomotives]\n* ''Turning a Locomotive into a Stationary Engine'', [[Popular Science]] monthly, February 1919, page 72, Scanned by Google Books: https://books.google.com/books?id=7igDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA72\n\n{{Locostyles}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Locomotives| ]]"}]}}}}
