The junction is covered by an illumination window, usually having an [[anti-reflective coating]].  The absorbed photons make [[Carrier generation and recombination|electron-hole pairs]] in the [[depletion region]]. Photodiodes and photo transistors are a few examples of photo detectors.  [[Solar cell]]s similarly absorb light and turn it into energy.\n\n== Types ==\nPhotodetectors may be classified by their mechanism for detection:<ref name=\"Donati2000\">{{cite web|last1=Donati|first1=S.|title=Photodetectors|url=http://www-3.unipv.it/donati/private/Photodetectors/introd.pdf|website=unipv.it|publisher=Prentice Hall|accessdate=1 June 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Yotter2003\">{{cite journal|last1=Yotter|first1=R.A.|last2=Wilson|first2=D.M.|title=A review of photodetectors for sensing light-emitting reporters in biological systems|journal=IEEE Sensors Journal|date=June 2003|volume=3|issue=3|pages=288\u2013303|doi=10.1109/JSEN.2003.814651}}</ref><ref name=\"St\u00f6ckmann1975\">{{cite journal|last1=St\u00f6ckmann|first1=F.|title=Photodetectors, their performance and their limitations|journal=Applied Physics|date=May 1975|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1\u20135|doi=10.1007/BF00900511}}</ref>\n* [[Photoemission]]: Photons cause electrons to transition from the [[conduction band]] of a material to free electrons in a vacuum or gas.\n* Photoelectric: Photons cause electrons to transition from the [[valence band]] to the conduction band of a [[semiconductor]].\n* Photovoltaic: Photons cause a voltage to develop across a [[depletion region]] of a [[photovoltaic cell]].\n* Thermal: Photons cause electrons to transition to mid-gap states then decay back to lower bands, inducing [[phonon]] generation and thus heat.\n* [[Polarization (waves)|Polarization]]: Photons induce changes in polarization states of suitable materials, which may lead to change in [[index of refraction]] or other polarization effects.\n* Photochemical: Photons induce a chemical change in a material.\n* Weak interaction effects: photons induce secondary effects such as in photon drag<ref name=\"Grinberg1988\">{{cite journal|last1=A.

Single sensors may detect overall light levels. A 1-D array of photodetectors, as in a [[spectrophotometer]] or a [[Line scanner]], may be used to measure the distribution of light along a line. A 2-D array of photodetectors may be used as an [[image sensor]] to form images from the pattern of light before it.\n\n== Properties ==\nThere are a number of performance metrics, also called [[Figure of merit|figures of merit]], by which photodetectors are characterized and compared<ref name=\"Donati2000\" /><ref name=\"Yotter2003\" />\n* Spectral response: The response of a photodetector as a function of photon frequency.\n* [[Quantum efficiency]]: The number of carriers (electrons or [[Electron hole|hole]]s) generated per photon.\n* [[Responsivity]]: The output current divided by total light power falling upon the photodetector.\n* [[Noise-equivalent power]]: The amount of light power needed to generate a signal comparable in size to the [[noise]] of the device.\n* [[Specific detectivity|Detectivity]]: The square root of the detector area divided by the noise equivalent power.\n* Gain: The output current of a photodetector divided by the current directly produced by the photons incident on the detectors, i.e., the built-in [[current gain]].\n* [[Dark current (physics)|Dark current]]: The current flowing through a photodetector even in the absence of light.\n* [[Response time (technology)|Response time]]: The time needed for a photodetector to go from 10% to 90% of final output.\n* Noise spectrum: The intrinsic noise voltage or current as a function of frequency. This can be represented in the form of a [[noise spectral density]].\n\n== Devices ==\nGrouped by mechanism, photodetectors include the following devices:\n\n=== Photoemission ===\n* [[Gaseous ionization detector]]s are used in experimental [[particle physics]] to detect photons and particles with sufficient energy to [[ionize]] gas atoms or molecules. Electrons and ions generated by ionization cause a current flow which can be measured.\n* [[Photomultiplier]] tubes containing a [[photocathode]] which emits [[electron]]s when illuminated, the electrons are then amplified by a chain of [[dynode]]s.\n* [[Phototube]]s containing a [[photocathode]] which emits [[electron]]s when illuminated, such that the tube conducts a current proportional to the [[Irradiance|light intensity]].\n* [[Microchannel plate detector]]s are silicon-based photomultipliers.\n\n=== Photoelectric ===\n* [[Active-pixel sensor]]s (APSs) are [[image sensor]]s.  Usually made in a [[complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor]] (CMOS) process, and also known as CMOS image sensors, APSs are commonly used in cell phone cameras, web cameras, and some [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|DSLRs]].\n* [[Cadmium zinc telluride]] radiation detectors can operate in direct-conversion (or photoconductive) mode at room temperature, unlike some other materials (particularly germanium) which require liquid nitrogen cooling. Their relative advantages include high sensitivity for x-rays and gamma-rays, due to the high atomic numbers of Cd and Te, and better energy resolution than scintillator detectors.\n* [[Charge-coupled device]]s (CCD), which are used to record images in [[astronomy]], [[digital photography]], and [[digital cinematography]]. Before the 1990s, [[photographic plate]]s were most common in astronomy.  The next generation of astronomical instruments, such as the [[Astro-E2]], include [[cryogenic detectors]].\n* [[HgCdTe]] infrared detectors. Detection occurs when an infrared photon of sufficient energy kicks an electron from the valence band to the conduction band. Such an electron is collected by a suitable external readout integrated circuits (ROIC) and transformed into an electric signal.\n* [[LED]]s which are reverse-biased to act as photodiodes. See [[LEDs as Photodiode Light Sensors]].\n* [[Photoresistor]]s or ''Light Dependent Resistors'' (LDR) which change [[electrical resistance|resistance]] according to [[Irradiance|light intensity]]. Normally the resistance of LDRs decreases with increasing intensity of light falling on it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oscience.info/infos/photo-detector-circuit/|title=Photo Detector Circuit|work=oscience.info}}</ref>\n* [[Photodiode]]s which can operate in photovoltaic mode or [[photoconductive]] mode.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rp-photonics.com/photodetectors.html|title=Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology - photodetectors, photodiodes, phototransistors, pyroelectric photodetectors, array, powermeter, noise|last=Paschotta|first=Dr. R\u00fcdiger|website=www.rp-photonics.com|access-date=2016-05-31}}</ref>\n* [[Phototransistor]]s, which act like amplifying photodiodes.\n* [[Quantum dot]] [[photoconductor]]s or [[photodiode]]s, which can handle wavelengths in the visible and infrared spectral regions.\n* [[Semiconductor detector]]s are employed in gamma and X-ray spectrometry and as particle detectors.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rizzi|first=M.|last2=D`Aloia|first2=M.|last3=Castagnolo|first3=B.|title=Semiconductor Detectors and Principles of Radiation-matter Interaction|url=http://scialert.net/fulltext/?doi=jas.2010.3141.3155&org=11|journal=Journal of Applied Sciences|volume=10|issue=23|pages=3141\u20133155|doi=10.3923/jas.2010.3141.3155}}</ref>\n* [[Silicon drift detector]]s (SDDs) are X-ray radiation detectors used in x-ray spectrometry (EDS) and [[electron microscopy]] (EDX).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/brochures/TN52342_E_0512M_SiliconDrift_H.pdf|title=Silicon Drift Detectors|last=|first=|date=|website=tools.thermofisher.com|publisher=Thermo Scientific|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Photovoltaic ===\n* [[Photovoltaic]] cells or [[solar cell]]s which produce a [[voltage]] and supply an [[electric current]] when illuminated.\n\n=== Thermal ===\n* [[Bolometer]]s measure the power of incident electromagnetic radiation via the heating of a material with a temperature-dependent electrical resistance.
