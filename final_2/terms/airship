[[Helium]] gas has almost the same lifting capacity and is not flammable, unlike hydrogen, but is rare and relatively expensive. Significant amounts were first discovered in the United States and for a while helium was only used for airships by the United States.<ref>{{cite web | title = Discovery of Helium in Natural Gas at the University of Kansas | work = National Historic Chemical Landmarks | publisher = American Chemical Society | url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/heliumnaturalgas.html | accessdate = 2014-02-21 }}</ref> Most airships built since the 1960s have used helium, though some have used hot air.<ref group=\"note\" >A few airships after [[World War II]] still used hydrogen. The first British airship to use helium was the [[Chitty Bang Bang (airship)|''Chitty Bang Bang'']] of 1967.</ref>\n\nThe envelope of an airship may  form a single gas bag, or may contain a number of internal gas-filled cells.  An airship also has engines, crew, and optionally also payload accommodation, typically housed in one or more \"gondolas\" suspended below the envelope.\n\nThe main types of airship are [[non-rigid airship|non-rigid]], [[semi-rigid airship|semi-rigid]], and [[rigid airship|rigid]].<ref name=\"ege\" /> Non-rigid airships, often called \"blimps\", rely on internal pressure to maintain the shape of the airship. Semi-rigid airships maintain the envelope shape by internal pressure, but have some form of supporting structure, such as a fixed keel, attached to it. Rigid airships have an outer structural framework which maintains the shape and carries all structural loads, while the lifting gas is contained in one or more internal gas bags or cells.<ref>Mowthorpe, C.

Their decline was accelerated by a series of high-profile accidents, including the 1930 crash and burning of British ''[[R101]]'' in France, the 1933 and 1935 storm-related crashes of the twin [[airborne aircraft carrier]] U.S. Navy helium-filled rigids, the {{USS|Akron|ZRS-4|6}} and [[USS Macon (ZRS-5)|''USS Macon'']] respectively, and the 1937 burning of the [[hydrogen]]-filled ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]''. From the 1960s, helium airships have been used in applications where the ability to hover in one place for an extended period outweighs the need for speed and manoeuvrability such as [[advertising]], tourism, [[camera]] platforms, geological surveys, and [[Observation aircraft|aerial observation]].\n\n==Terminology==\n\n===Airship===\nDuring the pioneer years of aeronautics, terms such as \"airship\", \"air-ship\", \"air ship\" and \"ship of the air\" meant any kind of navigable or dirigible flying machine.<ref>[http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth172915/ US patent 467069] \"Air-ship\" referring to a compound aerostat/rotorcraft.</ref><ref>[[Ezekiel Airship]] (1902) [http://www.wright-brothers.org/History_Wing/History_of_the_Airplane/History_of_the_Airplane_Intro/History_of_the_Airplane_Intro.htm wright-brothers.org][http://altereddimensions.net/2012/burrell-cannon-flies-first-airplane altereddimensions.net] \"airship,\"- referring to an HTA aeroplane.</ref><ref>[http://gustavewhitehead.org/news_journalism/1901_-_flying.html The Bridgeport Herald, August 18, 1901] - \"air ship\" referring to Whitehead's aeroplane.</ref><ref>Cooley Airship of 1910, also called the Cooley monoplane.[http://www.wright-brothers.org/History_Wing/Aviations_Attic/UFOs/UFOs.htm][http://celticowboy.com/Round%20Aircraft%20Designs.htm]- a heavier-than-air monoplane.</ref><ref>Frater, A.; ''The Balloon Factory'', Picador (2009), Page 163. - Wright brothers' \"airship.\"</ref><ref>[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=879 George Griffith, ''The angel of the Revolution'', 1893] - \"air-ship,\" \"vessel\" referring to a VTOL compound rotorcraft (not clear from the reference if it might be an aerostat hybrid.)</ref> In 1919 [[Frederick Handley Page]] was reported as referring to \"ships of the air,\" with smaller passenger types as \"Air yachts.\"<ref>[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=AS19190224.2.104 Auckland Star, 24 February 1919] \"Ships of the air,\" \"Air yachts\" - passenger landplanes large and small</ref> In the 1930s, large intercontinental flying boats were also sometimes referred to as \"ships of the air\" or \"flying-ships\".<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17455790 The Sydney Morning Herald, Monday 11 April 1938] -\"ship of the airs,\" \"flying-ship,\" referring to a large flying-boat.</ref><ref>[http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/america-by-air/online/innovation/innovation16.cfm Smithsonian, America by air] \"Ships of the Air\" referring to Pan Am's Boeing Clipper flying-boat fleet.</ref> Nowadays the term \"airship\" is used only for powered, dirigible balloons, with sub-types being classified as rigid, semi-rigid or non-rigid.<ref name=\"ege\" /> Semirigid architecture is the more recent and the late appearance is caused by both advancements about deformable structures and exigiency of reducing weight and volume of the airships.

The interior contains one or more gas bags, cells or balloons to provide lift. Rigid airships are typically unpressurised and can be made to virtually any size. Most, but not all, of the German [[Zeppelin]] airships have been of this type.\n\n===Semi-rigid airships===\n{{Main article|Semi-rigid airship}}\nA semi-rigid airship has some kind of supporting structure but the main envelope is held in shape by the internal pressure of the lifting gas. Typically the airship has an extended, usually articulated keel running along the bottom of the envelope to stop it kinking in the middle by distributing suspension loads into the envelope, while also allowing lower envelope pressures.\n\n===Non-rigid airships===\n{{Main article|blimp}}\nNon-rigid airships are often called \"Blimps\". Most, but not all, of the American [[Goodyear blimp|Goodyear airship]]s have been blimps.\n\nA non-rigid airship relies entirely on internal gas pressure to retain its shape during flight. Unlike the rigid design, the nonrigid airship's gas envelope has no compartments. However, it typically has smaller internal bags or \"ballonets\" containing air. At sea level, the ballonets are filled with air. As altitude is increased, the lifting gas expands and air from the ballonets is expelled through valves to maintain the hull shape. To return to sea level, the process is reversed. Air is forced back into the ballonets by both scooping air from the engine exhaust and using auxiliary blowers.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Usn-airships.jpg|thumb|US Navy airships and balloons, 1931: in the background, ZR-3, in front of it, (l to r) J-3 or 4, K-1, ZMC-2, in front of them, \"Caquot\" observation balloon, and in foreground free balloons used for training.]]\nThe two main parts of an airship are its gas-containing envelope and a gondola or similar structure slung beneath and containing crew and other equipment. The engines may be mounted in the gondola or elsewhere off the envelope.\n\n===Structure===\n{{Expand section|date=September 2016}}\nThe basic structure of an airship may be rigid, semi-rigid or non-rigid, as described.\n\n===Envelope===\nThe envelope itself is the structure, including textiles that contains the buoyant gas. Internally two ballonets placed in the front part and in the rear part of the hull contains air.<ref>Khoury, G. A. (2012). Airship technology (Vol. 10). Cambridge university press. http://airshipposter.de/files/2012_cambridge_university_-_airship_technology_-_second_edition.pdf</ref> surrounding one or more gas-bags or ballonets within it.\n\nThe problem of the exact determination of the pressure on an airship envelope is still problematic and has fascinated major scientists such as [[Theodor Von Karman]]<ref>Von Karman, Theodor. \"Calculation of pressure distribution on airship hulls.\" (1930). http://authors.library.caltech.edu/47901/1/19930094841.pdf</ref>  over history.\n\nFins at the rear, together with propulsion, acts as rear ailerons on aircraft. They allow of the envelope stabilise the airship, allowing it to fly straight. On some designs (in particular non rigid) these fins are themselves part of a gas bag and gain their shape only when inflated.\n\nA few airships have been [[Metal-clad airship|metal-clad]], with rigid and nonrigid examples made. Each kind used a thin gastight metal envelope, rather than the usual rubber-coated fabric envelope. Only four metal-clad ships are known to have been built, and only two actually flew: [[David Schwarz (aviation inventor)|Schwarz]]'s first aluminum rigid airship of 1893 collapsed,<ref name=Dooley>[[#Dooley|Dooley]], A.185-A.186 citing Robinson, pp.2\u20133 collapsed on inflation</ref> while his second flew;<ref>[[#Dooley|Dooley]], A.193 (at Tempelhof, Berlin in 1897, landed but then collapsed)</ref> the nonrigid [[ZMC-2]] built for the US Navy flew from 1929 to 1941 when it was scrapped as too small for operational use on anti-submarine patrols;<ref>[http://nasgi.org/zmc2.htm NAS Grosse Ile], NASGIVM. 2006.</ref> while the 1929 nonrigid Slate Aircraft Corporation ''City of Glendale'' collapsed on its first flight attempt.<ref>National Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian Institution. 2008.

Retrieved 3 September 2008.{{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref> Both nonrigid ships nevertheless had strong metal [[monocoque]] envelopes which, while they maintained their shape uninflated, required an overpressure during flight.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Lifting gas===\nEarly airships used [[hydrogen]] as their [[lifting gas]], which is the lightest available. Typically it was generated during the filling process, by reacting dilute sulphuric acid with metal filings. The first hydrogen balloon in 1783 used iron filings, while the British [[British Army Dirigible No 1|Nulli Secundus]] of 1907 used zinc.\n\nLater, the USA began to use [[helium]] because it is non-flammable and has 92.7% of the buoyancy (lifting power) of hydrogen. Following a series of airship disasters in the 1930s, and especially the [[Hindenburg disaster|Hindenburg]] disaster where the airship burst into flames, hydrogen fell into disuse.\n\n[[Thermal airship]]s use a heated lifting gas, usually air, in a fashion similar to [[hot air balloon]]s. The first to do so was flown in 1973 by the British company [[Cameron Balloons]].<ref>\"Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1980-81\", Pages 609\u2013610</ref>\n\n===Gondola===\n[[File:Modern airship gondola.jpg|thumb|A gondola fitted with twin propellers]]\nThe term \"gondola\" is used to describe a crew car of an airship, slung beneath the centre of the envelope. These may be short, for cockpit and landing gear alone, or longer to provide passenger space. Early gondolas were open structures slung beneath the envelope, later ones were enclosed and hung directly from the internal framing. A nonrigid blimp carries all of its passengers within a gondola. Rigid airships may have further passenger or cargo space inside the envelope. The large airship ''Graf Zeppelin'' was noted for its distinctively short passenger gondola, mounted far forward so as to improve ground clearance. The majority of crew accommodation and cargo holds were placed inside the envelope.\n\n===Propulsion and control===\nSmall airships carry their engine(s) in their gondola. Where there were multiple engines on larger airships, these were placed in separate nacelles, termed ''power cars'' or ''engine cars''.<ref name=\"Brew, 1998, engine cars\" >{{cite book\n  |title=Sunbeam Aero-engines\n  |last=Brew |first=Alec\n  |year=1998\n  |ref=harv\n  |publisher=Airlife\n  |isbn=1-84037-023-8\n  |pages=41, 43, 92\n}}</ref> To allow asymmetric thrust to be applied for maneuvering, these power cars were mounted towards the sides of the envelope, away from the centre line gondola. This also raised them above the ground, reducing the risk of a propeller strike when landing. Widely spaced power cars were also termed ''wing cars'', from the use of \"wing\" to mean being on the side of something, as in a theater, rather than the [[wing|aerodynamic device]].<ref name=\"Brew, 1998, engine cars\" /> These engine cars carried a crew during flight who maintained the engines as needed, but who also worked the engine controls, throttle etc., mounted directly on the engine. Instructions were relayed to them from the pilot's station by a [[engine order telegraph|telegraph system]], as on a ship.<ref name=\"Brew, 1998, engine cars\" />\n\nWhile elevators and swivelling propellers provide fine control of altitude, larger changes of height used to be controlled by either venting gas to lose altitude or dropping ballast to gain altitude. Large airships typically carried several water tanks fore and aft, allowing them to adjust longitudinal trim as well as height. Some modern designs instead pump lifting gas between the gas bags and storage cylinders.\n\n==Environmental benefits==\n\n{{Expand section|date=September 2016}}\n\nThe main advantage of airships with respect to any other vehicle is of environmental nature. They require less energy to remain in flight, if compared to any other air vehicle.<ref>Colozza, A., & Dolce, J. (2003).

Although the basic principle is sound, such a craft was unrealizable then and remains so to the present day, since external air pressure would cause the spheres to collapse unless their thickness was such as to make them too heavy to be buoyant.<ref>{{cite web | title = Would a balloon filled with vacuum instead of helium float? | url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/question194.htm | accessdate = 24 July 2010}}</ref> A hypothetical craft constructed using this principle is known as a ''[[Vacuum airship]]''.\n\nA more practical dirigible airship was described by Lieutenant [[Jean Baptiste Marie Meusnier]] in a paper entitled \"''M\u00e9moire sur l\u2019\u00e9quilibre des machines a\u00e9rostatiques''\" (Memorandum on the equilibrium of aerostatic machines) presented to the [[French Academy]] on 3 December 1783. The 16 water-color drawings published the following year depict a {{convert|260|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} streamlined envelope with internal ballonnets that could be used for regulating lift: this was attached to a long carriage that could be used as a boat if the vehicle was forced to land in water. The airship was designed to be driven by three propellers and steered with a sail-like aft rudder. In 1784 [[Jean-Pierre Blanchard]] fitted a hand-powered propeller to a balloon, the first recorded means of propulsion carried aloft. In 1785 he crossed the [[English Channel]] in a balloon equipped with flapping wings for propulsion and a birdlike tail for steering.<ref>Winter & Degner (1933), pp. 26\u201327.</ref>\n\n====1800s\u20131900s====\n\nThe [[Timeline of aviation - 19th century|19th century]] saw continued attempts to add methods of propulsion to balloons.

This led to the most successful airships of all time: the Zeppelins, named after [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin|Count von Zeppelin]] who began working on rigid airship designs in the 1890s, leading to the flawed LZ1 in 1900 and the more successful [[Zeppelin LZ2|LZ2]] in 1906. The Zeppelin airships had a framework composed of triangular lattice girders covered with fabric which contained separate gas cells. At first multiplane tail surfaces were used for control and stability: later designs had simpler later [[Cruciform tail|cruciform]] tail surfaces. The engines and crew were accommodated in \"gondolas\" hung beneath the hull driving propellers attached to the sides of the frame by means of long drive shafts. Additionally, there was a passenger compartment (later a [[bomb bay]]) located halfway between the two engine compartments.\n\n[[Alberto Santos-Dumont]] was a wealthy [[Brazil]]ian who lived in France and had a passion for flying. He designed 18 balloons and dirigibles before turning his attention to fixed-winged aircraft.<ref>Niccoli, R.

With a non-rigid body and internal bracing wires, it overcame the flaws of these types of aircraft as regards both rigid structure (zeppelin type) and flexibility, providing the airships with more stability during flight, and the capability of using heavier engines and a greater passenger load. In 1905, helped by Captain A. Kindel\u00e1n, he built the airship \"Espa\u00f1a\" at the [[Guadalajara, Castile-La Mancha|Guadalajara]] military base. Next year he patented his design without attracting official interest. In 1909 he patented an improved design which he offered to the French [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Astra|Astra]] company, who started mass-producing it in 1911 as the [[Astra-Torres airship]]. The distinctive three-lobed design was widely used during the Great War by the Entente powers.\n\nOther airship builders were also active before the war: from 1902 the French company [[Lebaudy Fr\u00e8res]] specialized in semirigid airships such as the ''[[Lebaudy Patrie|Patrie]]'' and the ''[[Lebaudy R\u00e9publique|R\u00e9publique]]'', designed by their engineer Henri Julliot, who later worked for the American company [[Goodrich Corporation|Goodrich]]; the German firm [[Sch\u00fctte-Lanz]] built the wooden-framed SL series from 1911, introducing important technical innovations; another German firm [[Luft-Fahrzeug-Gesellschaft]] built the ''[[August von Parseval|Parseval]]-Luftschiff'' (PL) series from 1909,<ref name=LuegerLuftschiff>[[#Lueger1920|Lueger 1920]], pp.404\u2013412, [http://www.zeno.org/Lueger-1904/A/Luftschiff Luftschiff]</ref> and Italian [[Enrico Forlanini]]'s firm had built and flown the first two [[Forlanini airships]].<ref name=Lig>[[#Lig|Ligugnana, Sandro]]</ref>\n\nOn May 12, 1902, the inventor and [[Brazil]]ian aeronaut [[Augusto Severo de Albuquerque Maranhao]] and his French mechanic, Georges Sach\u00e9, died when they were flying over [[Paris]] at the airship called Pax.

The Navy ordered the construction of an experimental rigid in 1908. Officially known as [[HMA No. 1|His Majesty's Airship No. 1]] and nicknamed the ''Mayfly'', it broke its back in 1911 before making a single flight. Work on a successor did not start until 1913.\n\nIn 1910 [[Walter Wellman]] unsuccessfully attempted an aerial crossing of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the airship ''[[America (airship)|America]]''.\n\n===World War I===\n{{Main article|German strategic bombing during World War I}}\n[[File:German airship bombing Warsaw.JPG|thumb|German airship [[List of Sch\u00fctte-Lanz airships#SL2|Sch\u00fctte Lanz SL2]] [[Aerial bombing of cities|bombing]] [[Warsaw]] in 1914.]]\nThe prospect of airships as bombers had been recognized in Europe well before the airships were up to the task. [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The War in the Air]]'' (1908) described the obliteration of entire fleets and cities by airship attack. The Italian forces became the first to use dirigibles for a military purpose during the [[Italo\u2013Turkish War]], the first bombing mission being flown on 10 March 1912.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1912/1912%20-%200298.html With the Dirigibles at Tripoli][[Flight International|''Flight'']] 30 March 1912</ref>  It was [[World War I]], however, that marked the airship's real debut as a weapon. The Germans, French and Italians all used airships for scouting and tactical bombing roles early in the war, and all learned that the airship was too vulnerable for operations over the front. The decision to end operations in direct support of armies was made by all in 1917.<ref>Ventry & Koesnik (1982), p. 85.</ref><ref>Robinson (1973), pp. 126\u2013127.</ref>\n\nMany in the German military believed they had found the ideal weapon with which to counteract British naval superiority and strike at Britain itself. More realistic airship advocates believed the zeppelin's value was as a long range scout/attack craft for naval operations. Raids on England began in January 1915 and peaked in 1916: following losses to the British defenses only a few raids were made in 1917-8, the last in August 1918.<ref>Robinson 1994, p. 360.</ref> Zeppelins proved to be terrifying but inaccurate weapons. Navigation, target selection and bomb-aiming proved to be difficult under the best of conditions and the cloud cover that were frequently encountered by the airships reduced accuracy even further. The physical damage done by airships over the course of the war was insignificant, and the deaths that they caused amounted to a few hundred.<ref>Cole, Christopher and Cheesman, E. F. ''The Air Defence of Great Britain 1914\u20131918''. London: Putnam, 1984. ISBN 0-370-30538-8. p.449</ref>  Nevertheless, the raid caused a significant diversion of British resources to defense efforts. The airships were initially immune to attack by aircraft and antiaircraft guns: as the pressure in their envelopes was only just higher than ambient air, holes had little effect. But following the introduction of a combination of incendiary and explosive ammunition in 1916 their flammable hydrogen lifting gas made them vulnerable to the defending aeroplanes. Several were shot down in flames by British defenders, and many others destroyed in accidents. New designs capable of reaching greater altitude were developed, but although this made them immune from attack it made their bombing accuracy even worse.\n\nCountermeasures by the British included sound detection equipment, searchlights and anti-aircraft artillery, followed by night fighters in 1915. One tactic used early in the war, when their limited range meant the airships had to fly from forward bases and the only zeppelin production facilities were in Friedrichshafen, was the bombing of airship sheds by the British [[Royal Naval Air Service]]. Later in the war, the development of the aircraft carrier led to the first successful carrier-based air strike in history: on the morning of 19 July 1918 seven [[Sopwith Camel|Sopwith 2F.1 Camels]] were launched from {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} and [[Tondern raid|struck the airship base at Tondern]], destroying the zeppelins L&nbsp;54 and L&nbsp;60.<ref>Robinson (1994), pp. 340\u2013341.</ref>\n[[File:1918 view from French dirigible.jpg|thumb|left|View from a French dirigible approaching a ship in 1918.]]\n[[File:Zeppelin_wreck_23_sept_1916.JPG|thumb|right|Wreckage of Zeppelin L31 or L32 shot down over England 23 Sept 1916.]]\n\nThe British Army had abandoned airship development in favour of aeroplanes by the start of the war, but the Royal Navy had recognized the need for small airships to counteract the submarine and mine threat in coastal waters.<ref>Higham (1961), p. 111.</ref> Beginning in February 1915, they began to develop the [[SS class blimp|SS]] (Sea Scout) class of blimp. These had a small envelope of {{convert|1,699|-|1,982|m3|cuft|abbr=on}} and at first used aircraft [[fuselage]]s without the wing and tail surfaces as control cars. Eventually more advanced blimps with purpose built gondolas were built. The [[NS class blimp|NS class]] (North Sea) were largest and most effective nonrigid airships in British service. These had a gas capacity of {{convert|10200|m3|cuft|abbr=on}}, a crew of 10 and an endurance of 24 hours. Six {{convert|230|lb|sing=on|abbr=on}} bombs were carried, as well as three to five machine guns. British blimps were used for scouting, mine clearance, and [[convoy]] patrol duties. During the war, the British operated over 200 nonrigid airships.<ref>Mowthorpe, Ces, ''Battlebags'', Stroud, Gloucs, Allan Sutton Publishing, 1995, p. xxiii.</ref> Several were sold to Russia, France, the [[United States]], and [[Italy]]. The large number of trained crews, low attrition rate and constant experimentation in handling techniques meant that at the war's end Britain was the world leader in nonrigid airship technology.\n\nThe Royal Navy continued development of rigid airships until the end of the war. Eight rigid airships had been completed by the armistice, ([[No. 9r]], four [[23 class airship|23 Class]], two [[R23X class airship|R23X Class]] and one [[R31 class airship|R31 Class]]), although several more were in an advanced state of completion by the war's end.<ref>Patrick Abbott and Nick Walmsley, British Airships in Pictures: An Illustrated History, House of Lochar 1998, ISBN 1-899863-48-6 (pp.59\u201369)</ref>\nBoth France and Italy continued to use airships throughout the war. France preferred the nonrigid type, whereas Italy flew 49 semirigid airships in both the scouting and bombing roles.<ref>Ventry & Koesnik (1982), p. 97.</ref>\n\nAeroplanes had essentially replaced airships as bombers by the end of the war, and Germany's remaining zeppelins were destroyed by their crews, scrapped or handed over to the Allied powers as war reparations. The British rigid airship program, which had mainly been a reaction to the potential threat of the German airships, was wound down.\n\n===The interwar period===\n[[File:R-38-rescue.jpg|thumb|Rescuers scramble across the wreckage of British [[R38 (ZR-2)|R-38/USN ZR-2]], [[1921 in aviation|24 August 1921]]]]\nA number of nations operated airships between the two world wars. Britain, the United States and Germany were the only constructors of rigid airships, with Italy and France making limited use of Zeppelins handed over as war reparations. Italy, the Soviet Union, the United States and [[Japan]] mainly operated semirigid airships.\n\nUnder the terms of the Treaty of Versailles Germany was not allowed to build airships of greater capacity than a million cubic ft. Two small passenger airships, [[Zeppelin LZ 120 Bodensee|LZ&nbsp;120 ''Bodensee'']] and its sister-ship LZ&nbsp;121 ''Nordstern'', were built immediately after the war but were confiscated following the sabotage of the wartime Zeppelins that were to have been handed over as war reparations: ''Bodensee'' was given to Italy and LZ&nbsp;121 ''Nordstern'' to France. On May 12, 1926, the Italian semirigid airship ''[[Norge (airship)|Norge]]'' was the first aircraft to fly over the [[North Pole]].\n\nThe British [[R33 class airship|R33]] and [[R34 (airship)|R34]] were near-identical copies of the German L&nbsp;33 which had come down almost intact in Yorkshire on 24 September 1916.<ref>Higham (1961), p. 138.</ref> Despite being almost three years out of date by the time they were launched in 1919, they became two of the most successful airships in British service. The creation of the Royal Air Force (RAF) in early 1918 created a hybrid British airship program. The RAF was not interested in airships and the Admiralty was, so a deal was made where the Admiralty would design any future military airships while the RAF would handle manpower, facilities and operations.<ref name=\"Higham, Robin 1961, pg. 176\">Higham (1961), p. 176.</ref>  On 2 July 1919, R34 began the first double crossing of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] by an aircraft. It landed at [[Mineola, Long Island]] on 6 July after 108&nbsp;hours in the air. The return crossing began on 8 July and took 75 hours. This feat failed to generate enthusiasm for continued airship development, and the British airship program was rapidly wound down.\n\nDuring World War One the US Navy acquired it first airship, the DH-1,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtoDAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA7&dq=Popular%20Mechanics%20June%201916&pg=PA819#v=onepage&q=Popular%20Mechanics%20June%201916&f=true|title=Popular Mechanics|first=Hearst|last=Magazines|date=4 October 2016|publisher=Hearst Magazines|accessdate=4 October 2016|via=Google Books}}</ref> but it was destroyed while being inflated shortly after delivery to the Navy.

It was the first airship to be inflated with the [[noble gas]] [[helium]], which was then so scarce that the ''Shenandoah'' contained most of the world's supply. A second airship, {{USS|Los Angeles|ZR-3|6}}, was built by the Zeppelin company as compensation for the airships which should have been handed over as war reparations according to the terms of the [[Versailles Treaty]] but had been sabotaged by their crews. This construction order saved the Zeppelin works from the threat of closure. The success of the ''Los Angeles'', which was flown successfully for 8 years, encouraged the US Navy to invest in its own, larger airships. When the ''Los Angeles'' was delivered, the two airships had to share the limited supply of helium, and thus alternated operating and overhauls.<ref>Althoff, William F., ''USS Los Angeles'', Washington DC, Brassey's, 2004, p. 48, ISBN 1-57488-620-7</ref>\n\nIn 1922 [[Charles Dennistoun Burney|Sir Dennistoun Burney]] suggested a plan for a subsidised air service throughout the British Empire using airships (the Burney Scheme).<ref name=\"Higham, Robin 1961, pg. 176\" /> Following the coming to power of [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government in 1924, the Burney scheme was transformed into the [[Imperial Airship Scheme]], under which two airships were built, one by a private company, and the other by the Royal Airship Works under Air Ministry control. The two designs were radically different. The \"capitalist\" ship, the ''[[R100]]'', was more conventional, while the \"socialist\" ship, the [[R101]], had many innovative design features. Construction of both took longer than expected, and the airships did not fly until 1929. Neither airship was capable of the service intended, though the R100 did complete a proving flight to Canada and back in 1930.<ref>Countryman, Barry, ''R100 in Canada'', Erin, Ontario, Boston Mills, 1982, ISBN 0-919822-36-3</ref> However, on 5 October 1930 the R101, which had not been thoroughly tested after major modifications, crashed on its maiden voyage at Beauvais in France killing 48 of the 54 people aboard. Among the dead were the craft's chief designer and the Secretary of State for Air. The disaster put an end to further British airship development.\n\nThe [[Locarno Treaties]] of 1925 lifted the restrictions on German airship construction, and the Zeppelin company started construction of the [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|''Graf Zeppelin'' (LZ&nbsp;127)]], the largest airship that could be built in the company's existing shed, and intended to stimulate interest in passenger airships. The ''Graf Zeppelin'' burned ''[[blau gas]]'', similar to [[propane]], stored in large gas bags below the hydrogen cells, as fuel. Since its density was similar to that of air, it avoided the weight change as fuel was used, and thus the need to [[valve]] hydrogen. The ''Graf Zeppelin'' was a great success and had an impressive safety record, flying over {{convert|1600000|km|mi|abbr=on}} (including the first circumnavigation of the globe by air) without a single passenger injury.<ref>Botting, Douglas, ''Dr. Eckener's Dream Machine''.

ISBN 0-8050-6458-3</ref>\n\n[[File:Uss-akron-manhattan.jpg|thumb|USS ''Akron'' over [[Lower Manhattan]] circa 1932]]\nThe US Navy experimented with the use of airships as [[airborne aircraft carrier]]s, developing an idea pioneered by the British. The [[USS Los Angeles (ZR-3)|USS Los Angeles]] was used for initial experiments, and the {{USS|Akron|ZRS-4|6}} and {{USS|Macon|ZRS-5|2}}, the world's largest at the time, were used to test the principle in naval operations. Each carried four [[F9C Sparrowhawk]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] in its hangar, and could carry a fifth on the trapeze. The idea had mixed results. By the time the Navy started to develop a sound doctrine for using the ZRS-type airships, the last of the two built, USS ''Macon'', had been lost. The seaplane had become more capable, and was considered a better investment.<ref>Smith (1965), pp. 171\u2013174.</ref>\n\nEventually the US Navy lost all three American-built rigid airships to accidents. USS ''Shenandoah'' flew into a [[severe thunderstorm]] over [[Noble County, Ohio]] while on a poorly planned publicity flight on [[1925 in aviation|3 September 1925]]. It broke into pieces, killing 14 of its crew. USS ''Akron'' was caught in a severe storm and flown into the surface of the sea off the shore of New Jersey on [[1933 in aviation|3 April 1933]]. It carried no life boats and few life vests, so 73 of its crew of 76 died from drowning or hypothermia.\nUSS ''Macon'' was lost after suffering a structural failure offshore near [[Point Sur Lighthouse]] on [[1935 in aviation|12 February 1935]]. The failure caused a loss of gas, which was made much worse when the aircraft was driven over pressure height causing it to lose too much helium to maintain flight.<ref>Smith (1965), pp. 157\u2013161.</ref> Only 2 of its crew of 83 died in the crash thanks to the inclusion of life jackets and inflatable rafts after the ''Akron'' disaster.\n\nThe [[Empire State Building]] was completed in 1931 with a dirigible mast, in anticipation of passenger airship service. Various entrepreneurs experimented with commuting and shipping freight via airship.<ref>{{cite journal|url=|date=2010-02-26|title=Intercity Dirigible Service}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s the German Zeppelins successfully competed with other means of transport. They could carry significantly more passengers than other contemporary aircraft while providing amenities similar to those on ocean liners, such as private cabins, observation decks, and dining rooms. Less importantly, the technology was potentially more energy-efficient than heavier-than-air designs. Zeppelins were also faster than ocean liners. On the other hand, operating airships was quite involved. Often the crew would outnumber passengers, and on the ground large teams were necessary to assist mooring and very large hangars were required at airports.\n\n[[File:Hindenburg burning.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'' catches fire, 6 May 1937]]\nBy the mid-1930s only Germany still pursued airship development.

Even with the small ''Graf Zeppelin'', the operation was almost profitable.<ref>Botting, Douglas, ''Dr. Eckener's Dream Machine''.

However, 1937 started with the most spectacular and widely remembered airship accident. Approaching the [[mooring mast]] minutes before landing on 6 May 1937, the ''Hindenburg'' burst into flames and crashed. Of the 97 people aboard, 36 died: 13 passengers, 22 aircrew, and one American ground-crewman. The disaster happened before a large crowd, was filmed and a [[Herbert Morrison (announcer)|radio news reporter]] was recording the arrival. This was a disaster which theatergoers could see and hear in [[newsreels]]. The ''Hindenburg'' disaster shattered public confidence in airships, and brought a definitive end to their \"golden age\". The day after the ''Hindenburg'' crashed, the ''Graf Zeppelin'' landed at the end of its flight from Brazil. This was the last international passenger airship flight.\n\n''Hindenburg''{{'}}s sister ship, the [[LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin|''Graf Zeppelin II'' (LZ 130)]], could not perform commercial passenger flights without helium, which the United States refused to sell. The ''Graf Zeppelin'' flew some test flights and conducted electronic espionage until 1939 when it was grounded due to the start of the war. The last two Zeppelins were scrapped in 1940.\n\nDevelopment of airships continued only in the United States, and to a smaller extent, the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union had several semirigid and nonrigid airships. The semirigid dirigible [[SSSR-V6 OSOAVIAKhIM]] was among the largest of these craft, and it set the longest endurance flight at the time of over 130 hours. However, it crashed into a mountain in 1938, killing 13 of the 19 people on board. While this was a severe blow to the Soviet airship program, they continued to operate nonrigid airships until 1950.\n\n===World War II===\nWhile Germany determined that airships were obsolete for military purposes in the coming war and concentrated on the development of aeroplanes, the United States pursued a program of military airship construction even though it had not developed a clear [[military doctrine]] for airship use. When the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941, bringing the United States into [[World War II]], the U.S. Navy had 10 nonrigid airships:\n*4 ''K''-class: ''K-2'', ''K-3'', ''K-4'' and ''K-5'' designed as patrol ships built from 1938.\n*3 ''L''-class: ''L-1'', ''L-2'' and ''L-3'' as small training ships, produced from 1938.\n*1 ''G''-class built in 1936 for training.\n*2 ''TC''-class that were older patrol ships designed for land forces, built in 1933. The US Navy acquired them from the United States Army in 1938.\n[[File:Goodyear ZNPK (K-28) Puritan (2834542477).jpg|thumb|Control car (gondola) of the Goodyear ZNPK (K-28) later operated by Goodyear as Puritan VI]]\n\nOnly ''K''- and ''TC''-class airships were suitable for combat and they were quickly pressed into service against Japanese and German [[submarine]]s which were then sinking American shipping within visual range of the American coast. U.S. Navy command, remembering airship's anti-submarine success in World War I, immediately requested new modern antisubmarine airships and on 2 January 1942 formed the ZP-12 patrol unit based in [[Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst|Lakehurst]] from the four ''K'' airships. The ZP-32 patrol unit was formed from two ''TC'' and two ''L'' airships a month later, based at [[Moffett Federal Airfield|NAS Moffett Field]] in [[Sunnyvale, California]]. An airship training base was created there as well. The status of submarine-hunting Goodyear airships in the early days of [[World War II]] has created significant confusion. Although various accounts refer to airships ''Resolute'' and ''Volunteer'' as operating as \"privateers\" under a [[Letter of Marque]], Congress never authorized a commission, nor did the President sign one.<ref>Theodore Richard, Reconsidering the [[Letter of Marque]]: Utilizing Private Security Providers Against Piracy (April 1, 2010).

The U.S. airships were produced by the [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] factory in [[Akron, Ohio]]. From 1942 till 1945, 154 airships were built for the U.S. Navy (133 ''K''-class, 10 ''L''-class, seven ''G''-class, four ''M''-class) and five ''L''-class for civilian customers (serial numbers ''L-4'' to ''L-8'').\n\nThe primary airship tasks were patrol and [[convoy]] escort near the American coastline. They also served as an organization centre for the convoys to direct ship movements, and were used in naval search and rescue operations. Rarer duties of the airships included aerophoto reconnaissance, naval mine-laying and mine-sweeping, parachute unit transport and deployment, cargo and personnel transportation. They were deemed quite successful in their duties with the highest combat readiness factor in the entire US air force (87%).\n\nDuring the war, some 532 ships without airship escort were sunk near the US coast by enemy submarines. Only one ship, the tanker ''Persephone'', of the 89,000 or so in convoys escorted by blimps was sunk by the enemy.<ref>Vaeth, J.

They were excellent at driving submarines down, where their limited speed and range prevented them from attacking convoys. The weapons available to airships were so limited that until the advent of the [[homing torpedo]] they had little chance of sinking a submarine.<ref name=\"Vaeth, J. Gordon 1992\">Vaeth, J.

Using [[radar]], the airship located a surfaced German submarine. The K-74 made her attack run but the U-boat opened fire first. ''K-74''{{'}}s [[depth charge]]s did not release as she crossed the U-boat and the ''K-74'' received serious damage, losing gas pressure and an engine but landing in the water without loss of life. The crew was rescued by patrol boats in the morning, but one crewman, Aviation Machinist's Mate Second Class Isadore Stessel, died from a [[shark]] attack. The U-Boat, {{Ship|German|submarine U-134|1941|2}}, was slightly damaged and the next day or so was attacked by aircraft, sustaining damage that forced it to return to base. It was finally sunk on 24 August 1943 by a British [[Vickers Wellington]] near [[Vigo, Spain]].<ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/download/lta-08.pdf U.S. Navy LTA history]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref><ref>[http://uboat.net/boats/u134.htm U-134 history], ''Uboat.net''.</ref>\n\nFleet Airship Wing One operated from Lakehurst, NJ, Glynco, GA, Weeksville, NC, [[South Weymouth NAS]] Massachusetts, [[Brunswick NAS]] and Bar Harbor ME, Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, and Argentia, Newfoundland.\n\n[[File:USN ZP-14 Blimp at RAF Gibraltar 1944.jpg|thumb|K-class blimps of USN Blimp Squadron ZP-14 conducted antisubmarine warfare operations at the Strait of Gibraltar in 1944-45.]]\nSome US airships saw action in the European war theater. In 1944-45, the U.S. Navy moved an entire squadron of eight Goodyear [[K class blimp]]s (K-123, K-130, K-109, K-134, K-101, K-112, K-89, & K-114) with flight and maintenance crews from [[Weeksville Dirigible Hangar|Weeksville Naval Air Station]] in North Carolina to [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey]], [[French Morocco]].<ref>http://www.naval-airships.org/resources/documents/NAN_vol93_no2_KShips_feature.pdf</ref> Their mission was to locate and destroy German U-boats in the relatively shallow waters around the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] where [[magnetic anomaly detection]] (MAD) was viable. PBY aircraft had been searching these waters but MAD required low altitude flying that was dangerous at night for these aircraft. The blimps were considered a perfect solution to establish a [[24/7]] MAD barrier (fence) at the Straits of Gibraltar with the PBYs flying the day shift and the blimps flying the night shift. The first two blimps (K-123 & K-130) left [[Naval Air Station South Weymouth|South Weymouth NAS]] on 28 May 1944 and flew to [[Naval Station Argentia|Argentia, Newfoundland]], the [[Lajes Field|Azores]], and finally to [[Kenitra Airport|Port Lyautey]] where they completed the first transatlantic crossing by nonrigid airships on 1 June 1944. The blimps of USN Blimp Squadron ZP-14 (Blimpron 14, aka ''The Africa Squadron'') also conducted mine-spotting and mine-sweeping operations in key Mediterranean ports and various escorts including the convoy carrying United States President [[Franklin D.

It made 1432 runs with 300&nbsp;[[tonne|metric tons]] of cargo until 1945. On 1 February 1945, the Soviets constructed a second airship, a ''Pobeda''-class (''Victory''-class) unit (used for mine-sweeping and wreckage clearing in the Black Sea) which crashed on 21 January 1947. Another ''W''-class - W-12bis ''Patriot'' - was commissioned in 1947 and was mostly used for crew training, parades and propaganda.\n\n===Postwar period===\n[[File:Goodyear blimp.jpg|thumb|left|One of the [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]]'s [[Goodyear Blimp|blimp]] fleet]]\nAlthough airships are no longer used for major cargo and passenger transport, they are still used for other purposes such as [[advertising]], [[sightseeing]], surveillance, research and [[advocacy]].\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Per Lindstrand]] and his team introduced the ''GA-42'' airship, the first airship to use [[Aircraft flight control system#Fly-by-wire control systems|fly-by-wire flight control]] which considerably reduced the pilot's workload.\n\nThe world's largest [[thermal airship]] ({{convert|300,000|ft3|m3|abbr=off|lk=off|disp=x|; }}) was constructed by the [[Per Lindstrand]] company for French botanists in 1993. The ''AS-300'' carried an underslung raft, which was positioned by the airship on top of tree canopies in the rain forest, allowing the botanists to carry out their treetop research without significant damage to the rainforest.

Due to delays getting permission from the Russian government, the company decided to transport the airship to Japan by sea. One of the four NT craft is in South Africa carrying diamond detection equipment from De Beers, an application at which the very stable low vibration NT platform excels. The project included design adaptations for high temperature operation and desert climate, as well as a separate [[mooring mast]] and a very heavy mooring truck.

The design is very similar to the [[SkyCat]], unsuccessfully promoted for many years by the British company [[Airship Industries#ATG and its successors|Advanced Technologies Group]] (ATG). Although Lockheed Martin is developing a design for the DARPA [[WALRUS HULA]] project, it claimed that the P-791 is unrelated to WALRUS. Nonetheless, the design represents an approach that may well be applicable to WALRUS. Some believe that Lockheed Martin had used the secret P-791 program as a way to get a head start on the other WALRUS competitor, [[US Aeros Airships]].{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n===Passenger transport===\n[[File:Zeppelin NT im Flug.jpg|thumb|A [[Zeppelin NT]] airship]]\nIn the 1990s, the successor of the original Zeppelin company in [[Friedrichshafen]], the ''Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik GmbH'', reengaged in airship construction. The first experimental craft (later christened ''Friedrichshafen'') of the type \u2033[[Zeppelin NT]]\u2033 flew in September 1997. Though larger than common blimps, the ''Neue Technologie'' (New Technology) zeppelins are much smaller than their giant ancestors and not actually Zeppelin-types in the classical sense. They are sophisticated semirigids. Apart from the greater payload, their main advantages compared to blimps are higher speed and excellent maneuverability. Meanwhile, several ''Zeppelin NT'' have been produced and operated profitably in joyrides, research flights and similar applications.\n\nIn June 2004, a Zeppelin NT was sold for the first time to a Japanese company, Nippon Airship Corporation, for tourism and advertising mainly around Tokyo. It was also given a role at the [[Expo 2005|2005 Expo]] in [[Aichi]]. The aircraft began a flight from Friedrichshafen to Japan, stopping at [[Geneva]], Paris, [[Rotterdam]], [[Munich]], Berlin, [[Stockholm]] and other European cities to carry passengers on short legs of the flight. However, Russian authorities denied overflight permission so the airship had to be dismantled and shipped to Japan rather than following the historic ''Graf Zeppelin'' flight from Germany to Japan.\n\nIn 2008, [[Airship Ventures|Airship Ventures Inc.]] began operations from [[Moffett Federal Airfield]] near [[Mountain View, California]] and until November 2012 offered tours of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] for up to 12 passengers.\n\n===Exploration===\nIn November 2005, [[De Beers]], the diamond mining company, launched an airship exploration program over the remote [[Kalahari desert]]. A Zeppelin, equipped with a Bell Geospace [[gravity gradiometer]], is used to find potential diamond mines by scanning the local geography for low-density rock formations - so-called [[kimberlite pipes]]. On 21 September 2007, the airship was severely damaged by a whirlwind while in Botswana. One crew member, who was on watch aboard the moored craft, was slightly injured but released after overnight observation in hospital.\n<!-- Preceding sections were moved from Zeppelin but need merging and cleanup here.-->\n\n===Thermal airships===\n[[File:Prallluftschiff 01 KMJ.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Thermal airship]] (manufacturer GEFA-FLUG/Germany)]]\n\nSeveral companies, such as [[Cameron Balloons]] in [[Bristol]], United Kingdom, build [[Thermal airship|hot-air airships]]. These combine the structures of both hot-air balloons and small airships. The envelope is the normal cigar shape, complete with tail fins, but is inflated with hot air instead of helium to provide the lifting force. A small gondola, carrying the pilot and passengers, a small engine, and the burners to provide the hot air are suspended below the envelope, beneath an opening through which the burners protrude.\n\nHot-air airships typically cost less to buy and maintain than modern helium-based [[blimp]]s, and can be quickly deflated after flights. This makes them easy to carry in trailers or trucks and inexpensive to store. They are usually very slow moving, with a typical top speed of 25\u201330&nbsp;km/h (15\u201320&nbsp;mph, 6.7\u20138.9&nbsp;m/s). They are mainly used for advertising, but at least one has been used in [[rainforest]]s for wildlife observation, as they can be easily transported to remote areas.\n\n===Unmanned remotes===\n[[Remote control|Remote-controlled]] (RC) airships, a type of [[unmanned aerial system]] (UAS), are sometimes used for commercial purposes such as advertising and aerial video and photography as well as recreational purposes. They are particularly common as an advertising mechanism at indoor stadiums. While RC airships are sometimes flown outdoors, doing so for commercial purposes is illegal in the US.<ref>[http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/uas/reg/media/frnotice_uas.pdf FAA Docket FAA-2006-25714] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620011126/http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/uas/reg/media/frnotice_uas.pdf |date=June 20, 2007 }}, Federal Aviation Authority.</ref> Commercial use of an unmanned airship must be certified under part 121.{{clarify|date=September 2016}}\n\n==Current design projects==\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2008}}\n[[File:Giant Aircraft Comparison.svg|thumb|right|260px|The largest airship, the [[LZ 129 Hindenburg]] at 245 meters length and 41 meters diameter, dwarfs the size of the largest historic and modern passenger and cargo aeroplanes.]]\nToday, with large, fast, and more cost-efficient [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and [[helicopters]], it is unknown whether huge airships can operate profitably in regular passenger transport though, as energy costs rise, attention is once again returning to these lighter-than-air vessels as a possible alternative. At the very least, the idea of comparatively slow, \"majestic\" cruising at relatively low altitudes and in comfortable atmosphere certainly has retained some appeal. There have been some niches for airships in and after World War II, such as long-duration observations, [[Anti-submarine warfare|antisubmarine]] patrol, platforms for TV camera crews, and [[advertising]]; these, however, generally require only small and flexible craft, and have thus generally been better fitted for cheaper (non-passenger) blimps.\n\n===Heavy lifting===\nIt has periodically been suggested that airships could be employed for [[cargo transport]], especially delivering extremely heavy loads to areas with poor infrastructure over great distances. This has also been called roadless trucking.<ref>[http://www.dynalifter.com/Dynaliftercom/RoadlessTrucking.htm \"Roadless trucking\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523073252/http://www.dynalifter.com/Dynaliftercom/RoadlessTrucking.htm |date=May 23, 2009 }}, Dynalifter.</ref> Also, airships could be used for heavy lifting over short distances (e.g. on construction sites); this is described as heavy-lift, short-haul.<ref>[http://www.deagel.com/news/Boeing-and-SkyHook-International-to-Build-JHL-40-Heavy-Lift-Rotorcraft_n000004518.aspx \"Boeing and SkyHook International to Build JHL-40 Heavy-Lift Rotorcraft\"], press release, 8 July 2008.</ref> In both cases, the airships are [[heavy hauler]]s. One recent enterprise of this sort was the ''[[Cargolifter]]'' project, in which a hybrid (thus not entirely Zeppelin-type) airship even larger than ''Hindenburg'' was projected. Around 2000, CargoLifter AG built the world's largest self-supporting hall, measuring {{convert|360|m|ft|abbr= on}} long, {{convert|210|m|ft|abbr= on}} wide and {{convert|107|m|ft|abbr=on}} high about {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Berlin. In May 2002, the project was stopped for financial reasons; the company had to file [[bankruptcy]]. The enormous CargoLifter hangar was later converted to house the [[Tropical Islands Resort]].<ref name=Lasker2016/> Although no rigid airships are currently used for heavy lifting, [[hybrid airship]]s are being developed for such purposes. [[AEREON 26]], tested in 1971, was described in [[John McPhee]]'s ''The Deltoid Pumpkin Seed''.\n\nAn impediment to the large-scale development of airships as heavy haulers has been figuring out how they can be used in a cost-efficient way. In order to have a significant economic advantage over ocean transport, cargo airships must be able to deliver their payload faster than ocean carriers but more cheaply than airplanes. William Crowder, a fellow at the [[Logistics Management Institute]], has calculated that cargo airships are only economical when they can transport 500 to 1,000 tons, approximately the same as a super-jumbo aircraft.<ref name=Lasker2016/> The large initial investment required to build such a large airship has been a hindrance to production, especially given the risk inherent in a new technology. The chief commercial officer of the company hoping to sell the [[LMH1|LMH-1]], a cargo airship currently being developed by [[Lockheed Martin]], believes that airships can be economical in hard-to-reach locations such as mining operations in northern Canada that currently require [[ice road]]s.<ref name=Lasker2016>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/29/a-new-generation-of-airships-is-born|title=Helium Dreams|last=Laskas|first=Jeanne Marie|date=2016-02-29|newspaper=The New Yorker|issn=0028-792X|access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref>\n\n===Metal-clad airships===\n{{Main article|Metal-clad airship}}\nA metal-clad airship has a very thin metal envelope, rather than the usual fabric. The shell may be either internally braced or [[monocoque]] as in the [[ZMC-2]] which flew many times in the 1920s, the only example ever to do so. The shell may be gas-tight as in a non-rigid blimp, or the design may employ internal gas bags as in a rigid airship. Compared to a fabric envelope the metal cladding is expected to be more durable.\n\n===Hybrid airships===\n{{Main article|Hybrid airship}}\nA [[hybrid airship]] is a general term for an aircraft that combines characteristics of heavier-than-air (aeroplane or helicopter) and lighter-than-air technology. Examples include helicopter/airship hybrids intended for heavy lift applications and dynamic lift airships intended for long-range cruising. It should be noted that most airships, when fully loaded with cargo and fuel, are usually ballasted to be heavier than air, and thus must use their propulsion system and shape to create aerodynamic lift, necessary to stay aloft. All airships can be operated to be slightly heavier than air at periods during flight ([[Descent (aircraft)|descent]]). However, the term \"hybrid airship\" refers to craft that obtain a significant portion of their lift from aerodynamic lift or other [[Kinetic energy|kinetic]] means.\n\nFor example, the [[Aeroscraft]] is a buoyancy assisted air vehicle that generates lift through a combination of aerodynamics, thrust vectoring and gas buoyancy generation and management, and for much of the time will fly heavier than air. Aeroscraft is [[Worldwide Aeros Corp|Worldwide Aeros Corporation's]] continuation of [[DARPA]]'s now cancelled [[Walrus HULA]] (Hybrid Ultra Large Aircraft) project.<ref>{{cite web | title = Aeroscraft.com | url=http://www.aeroscraft.com/ | accessdate = 24 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Airships in space exploration===\n[[File:NASA Cloud City on Venus.jpg|thumb|Artist's rendering of a NASA manned floating outpost on Venus]]\nAirships have been proposed as a potential cheap alternative to surface rocket launches for achieving Earth orbit. [[JP Aerospace]] have proposed the Airship to Orbit project, which intends to float a multi-stage airship up to [[mesosphere|mesospheric]] altitudes of 55&nbsp;km (180,000&nbsp;ft) and then use ion propulsion to accelerate to [[orbital speed]].<ref>[http://www.jpaerospace.com/atohandout.pdf Airship to Orbit]</ref> At these heights, air resistance would not be a significant problem for achieving such speeds. The company has not yet built any of the three stages.\n\n[[NASA]] have proposed the [[High Altitude Venus Operational Concept]], which comprises a series of five missions including manned missions to the atmosphere of [[Venus]] in airships.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://sacd.larc.nasa.gov/branches/space-mission-analysis-branch-smab/smab-projects/havoc/| title=HAVOC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0az7DEwG68A/| title=A way to explore Venus}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gizmag.com/nasa-havoc-concept-manned-mission-to-venus/35311//| title=NASA concept would send astronauts to Venus}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/tech/2014/12/20/nasa-havoc-venus.nasa-langley-research-cente//| title=NASA's floating 'habitat' above Venus?}}</ref> Pressures on the surface of the planet are too high for human habitation, but at a specific altitude the pressure is equal to that found on Earth and this makes Venus a potential target for human [[Colonization of Venus|colonization]].\n\n==Comparison with heavier-than-air aircraft==\nThe advantage of airships over aeroplanes is that [[Buoyancy|static lift]] sufficient for flight is generated by the lifting gas and requires no engine power. This was an immense advantage before the middle of [[World War I]] and remained an advantage for long distance, or long duration operations until [[World War II]]. Modern concepts for high altitude airships include [[Solar cell|photovoltaic cells]] to reduce the need to land to refuel, thus they can remain in the air until consumables expire.\n\nThe disadvantages are that an airship has a very large reference area and comparatively large [[drag coefficient]], thus a larger drag force compared to that of aeroplanes and even helicopters. Given the large frontal area and wetted surface of an airship, a practical limit is reached around {{convert|80|\u2013|100|mph|km/h|disp=flip}}. Thus airships are used where speed is not critical.\n\nThe lift capability of an airship is equal to the buoyant force minus the weight of the airship. This assumes standard air temperature and pressure conditions. Corrections are usually made for water vapor and impurity of lifting gas, as well as percentage of inflation of the gas cells at liftoff.<ref>Ausrotas, R. A., \"Basic Relationships for LTA Technical Analysis,\" MIT Flight Transportation Library, 1975</ref> Based on specific lift (lifting force per unit volume of gas), the greatest static lift is provided by hydrogen (11.15&nbsp;N/m<sup>3</sup> or 71&nbsp;lb<sub>f</sub>/1000&nbsp;cu&nbsp;ft) with helium (10.37&nbsp;N/m<sup>3</sup> or 66&nbsp;lb<sub>f</sub>/1000&nbsp;cu&nbsp;ft) a close second.<ref>Layton, D. M., Basic Aerostatics &ndash; A Tutorial, 1985</ref> At 6.13&nbsp;N/m<sup>3</sup> (39&nbsp;lb<sub>f</sub>/1000&nbsp;cu&nbsp;ft), steam is a distant third. Other cheap gases, such as methane, carbon monoxide, ammonia and natural gas{{Citation needed|reason=Both methane & ammonia have lower molar mass than water, so all other things equal, they (& probably natural gas) should be lighter than steam|date=November 2011}} have even less lifting capacity and are flammable, toxic, corrosive, or all three ([[neon]] is even more costly than helium, with less lifting capacity). Operational considerations such as whether the lift gas can be economically vented and produced in flight for control of buoyancy (as with hydrogen) or even produced as a byproduct of propulsion (as with steam) affect the practical choice of lift gas in airship designs.\n\nIn addition to static lift, an airship can obtain a certain amount of dynamic lift from its engines. Dynamic lift in past airships has been about 10% of the static lift. Dynamic lift allows an airship to \"take off heavy\" from a runway similar to fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. However, this requires additional weight in engines, fuel and landing gear, negating some of the static lift capacity.\n\nThe altitude at which an airship can fly largely depends on how much lifting gas it can lose due to expansion before [[Mechanical equilibrium|stasis]] is reached. The ultimate altitude record for a rigid airship was set in 1917 by the L-55 under the command of Hans-Kurt Flemming when he forced the airship to {{convert|24000|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} attempting to cross France after the \"Silent Raid\" on London. The L-55 lost lift during the descent to lower altitudes over Germany and crashed due to loss of lift.<ref>Robinson (1994), p. 294.</ref> While such waste of gas was necessary for the survival of airships in the later years of World War I, it was impractical for commercial operations, or operations of helium-filled military airships. The highest flight made by a hydrogen-filled passenger airship was {{convert|5500|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} on the ''Graf Zeppelin's'' around the world flight.<ref>\"Honors to Dr. Hugo Eckener: The First Airship Flight Around the World\", ''National Geographic'', Vol. LVII, No. 6, June 1930, p. 679.</ref> The practical limit for rigid airships was about {{convert|3000|ft|m|-2|disp=flip|abbr=on}}, and for pressure airships around {{convert|8000|ft|m|-2|abbr=on|disp=flip}}.{{Citation needed|reason=Contradicts preceding Graf Zeppelin sentence. Also, limits were determined from fuel and cargo load: reduce fuel and cargo and maximum safe altitude can increase, and vice versa.|date=July 2008}}\n\nModern airships use dynamic helium volume. At sea level altitude, helium only takes up a small part of the hull, while the rest is filled with air. As the airship ascends, the helium inflates with reduced outer pressure, and air is pushed out and released from the downward valve. This allows an airship to reach any altitude with balanced inner and outer pressure if the buoyancy is enough. Some civil aerostats could reach {{convert|100000|ft|m|abbr=on}} without explosion due to overloaded inner pressure.{{Citation needed|reason=Highly dubious, is this a typo? 100000 feet is {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} where atmosphere is about 1% the sea level density,([[:Image:Atmosphere model.png]]) so helium in an over-pressured blimp would be heavier than the surrounding air. Maybe a non-dirigible balloon is meant?|date=July 2008}}\n\nThe greatest disadvantage of the airship is size, which is essential to increasing performance. As size increases, the problems of ground handling increase geometrically.<ref>[[#Brooks1992|Brooks 1992]] pp. 7\u20138</ref> As the German Navy changed from the [[Zeppelin P Class|P class]] of 1915 with a volume of over {{convert|1100000|cuft|m3|abbr=on|disp=flip}} to the larger [[Zeppelin Q Class|Q class]] of 1916, the [[Zeppelin R Class|R class]] of 1917, and finally the [[Zeppelin W Class|W class]] of 1918, at almost {{convert|2200000|cuft|m3|abbr=on|disp=flip}} ground handling problems reduced the number of days the Zeppelins were able to make patrol flights. This availability declined from 34% in 1915, to 24.3% in 1916 and finally 17.5% in 1918.<ref>Robinson (1994), p. 373.</ref>\n\nSo long as the power-to-weight ratios of aircraft engines remained low and [[Brake specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]] high, the airship had an edge for long range or duration operations. As those figures changed, the balance shifted rapidly in the aeroplane's favour. By mid-1917, the airship could no longer survive in a combat situation where the threat was aeroplanes. By the late 1930s, the airship barely had an advantage over the aeroplane on intercontinental over-water flights, and that advantage had vanished by the end of World War II.\n\nThis is in face-to-face tactical situations. Currently, a [[High-altitude airship]] project is planned to survey hundreds of kilometres as their operation radius, often much farther than the normal engagement range of a military aeroplane.{{Clarify|date=July 2008}} <!-- rephrase for comprehension --> For example, a [[radar]] mounted on a vessel platform {{convert|30|m|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} high has radio horizon at {{convert|20|km|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} range, while a radar at {{convert|18000|m|ft|abbr=on}} altitude has radio horizon at {{convert|480|km|abbr=on}} range. This is significantly important for detecting low-flying cruise missiles or fighter-bombers.\n\n==Safety==\nThe most commonly used lifting gas, helium, is [[inert]] so presents no fire risk.<ref name=\"stwertka\">Stwertka, Albert, ''Guide to the Elements: Revised Edition''.
