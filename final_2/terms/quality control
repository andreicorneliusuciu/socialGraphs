Inspectors will be provided with lists and descriptions of unacceptable [[product defect]]s such as [[Fracture|cracks]] or surface [[wikt:blemish|blemish]]es for example.\n\nThe quality of the outputs is at risk if any of these three aspects is deficient in any way.\n\nQuality control emphasizes [[test method|testing]] of [[product (business)|product]]s to uncover defects and reporting to management who make the decision to allow or deny product release, whereas [[quality assurance]] attempts to improve and stabilize production (and associated processes) to avoid, or at least minimize, issues which led to the defect(s) in the first place.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} For contract work, particularly work awarded by government agencies, quality control issues are among the top reasons for not renewing a contract.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opm.gov/fedclass/gs1910.pdf |title=Position Classification Standard for Quality Assurance Series, GS-1910 |date=March 1983 |author= |publisher=US Office of Personnel Management |accessdate=21 December 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Notable approaches==\nThere is a tendency for individual consultants and organizations to name their own unique approaches to quality control\u2014a few of these have ended up in widespread use:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n!
