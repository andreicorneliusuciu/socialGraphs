It is [[dimensional analysis|dimensionally equivalent]] to [[impulse (physics)|impulse]], the product of [[force]] and [[time]], quantified in [[newton-second]]s. [[Newton's second law]] of motion states that the change in linear momentum of a body is equal to the net impulse acting on it. For example, a heavy truck moving rapidly has a large momentum, and it takes a large or prolonged force to get the truck up to this speed, and would take a similarly large or prolonged force to bring it to a stop. If the truck were lighter, or moving more slowly, then it would have less momentum and therefore require less impulse to start or stop.\n\nLike velocity, linear momentum is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity, possessing a direction as well as a magnitude:\n:<math>\\mathbf{p} = m \\mathbf{v},</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''p'''}} is the three-dimensional vector stating the object's momentum in the three directions of three-dimensional space, {{math|'''v'''}} is the three-dimensional velocity vector giving the object's rate of movement in each direction, and {{math|''m''}} is the object's mass.\n\nLinear momentum is also a ''conserved'' quantity, meaning that if a [[closed system]] is not affected by external forces, its total linear momentum cannot change.\n\nIn classical mechanics, [[#Conservation|conservation of linear momentum]]  is implied by [[Newton's laws]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Invitation to Contemporary Physics |edition=illustrated |first1=Quang |last1=Ho-Kim |first2=Narendra |last2=Kumar |first3=Harry C.

It is ultimately an expression of one of the fundamental symmetries of space and time, that of [[translational symmetry]].\n\nLinear momentum depends on frame of reference. Observers in different frames would find different values of linear momentum of a system. But each would observe that the value of linear momentum does not change with time, provided the system is isolated.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Newtonian mechanics==\nMomentum has a direction as well as magnitude. Quantities that have both a magnitude and a direction are known as [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantities. Because momentum has a direction, it can be used to predict the resulting direction of objects after they collide, as well as their speeds. Below, the basic properties of momentum are described in one dimension. The vector equations are almost identical to the scalar equations (see [[Momentum#Multiple dimensions|multiple dimensions]]).\n\n===Single particle===\nThe momentum of a particle is traditionally represented by the letter {{math|''p''}}. It is the product of two quantities, the [[mass]] (represented by the letter {{math|''m''}}) and [[velocity]] ({{math|''v''}}):<ref name=FeynmanCh9>{{harvnb|Feynman Vol. 1|loc=Chapter 9}}</ref>\n:<math>p = m v. </math>\n\nThe units of momentum are the product of the units of mass and velocity. In [[SI units]], if the mass is in kilograms and the velocity in meters per second then the momentum is in kilogram meters/second (kg&nbsp;m/s). In [[Centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system of units|cgs units]], if the mass is in grams and the velocity in centimeters per second, then the momentum is in gram centimeters/second (g cm/s).\n\nBeing a vector, momentum has magnitude and direction. For example, a 1&nbsp;kg model airplane, traveling due north at 1&nbsp;m/s in straight and level flight, has a momentum of 1&nbsp;kg&nbsp;m/s due north measured from the ground.\n\n===Many particles===\nThe momentum of a system of particles is the sum of their momenta. If two particles have masses {{math|''m''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''m''<sub>2</sub>}}, and velocities {{math|''v''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''v''<sub>2</sub>}}, the total momentum is\n:<math> \\begin{align} p &= p_1 + p_2 \\\\\n&= m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2\\,. \\end{align} </math>\nThe momenta of more than two particles can be added more generally with the following:\n:<math> p=\\sum_{i}m_iv_i </math>\n\nA system of particles has a [[center of mass]], a point determined by the weighted sum of their positions:\n:<math> r_\\text{cm} = \\frac{m_1 r_1 + m_2 r_2 + \\cdots}{m_1 + m_2 + \\cdots} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i}m_ir_i}{\\sum\\limits_{i}m_i}.</math>\n\nIf all the particles are moving, the center of mass will generally be moving as well (unless the system is in pure rotation around it). If the center of mass is moving at velocity {{math|''v''<sub>cm</sub>}}, the momentum is:\n:<math>p= mv_\\text{cm}.</math>\nThis is known as [[Euler's laws of motion|Euler's first law]].<ref name=\"BookRags\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/eulers-laws-of-motion-wom/\n|title=Euler's Laws of Motion\n|accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref><ref name=\"McGillKing\">{{cite book\n|title=Engineering Mechanics, An Introduction to Dynamics\n|edition=3rd\n|last=McGill and King\n|publisher=PWS Publishing Company\n|date=1995\n|isbn=0-534-93399-8}}</ref>\n\n===Relation to force===\n\nIf a force {{math|''F''}} is applied to a particle for a time interval {{math|&Delta;''t''}}, the momentum of the particle changes by an amount\n:<math>\\Delta p = F \\Delta t\\,.</math>\n\nIn differential form, this is [[Newton's second law]]; the rate of change of the momentum of a particle is proportional to the force {{math|''F''}} acting on it,<ref name=FeynmanCh9/>\n:<math>F = \\frac{dp }{d t}. </math>\n\nIf the force depends on time, the change in momentum (or [[impulse (physics)|impulse]] {{math|''J''}}) between times {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''t''<sub>2</sub>}}  is\n:<math> \\Delta p = J = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} F(t)\\, dt\\,.</math>\n\nImpulse is measured in the [[SI derived unit|derived unit]]s of the [[newton second]] (1&nbsp;N&nbsp;s = 1&nbsp;kg&nbsp;m/s) or [[dyne]] second (1 dyne s = 1 g m/s)\n\nUnder the assumption of constant mass {{math|''m''}}, it is equivalent to write\n:<math>F = m\\frac{dv}{d t} = m a,</math>\nso the force is equal to mass times [[acceleration]].<ref name=FeynmanCh9/>\n\n''Example'': A model airplane of 1&nbsp;kg accelerates from rest to a velocity of 6&nbsp;m/s due north in 2&nbsp;s. The net force required to produce this acceleration is 3&nbsp;[[newton (unit)|newtons]] due north. The change in momentum is 6&nbsp;kg&nbsp;m/s. The rate of change of momentum is 3&nbsp;(kg&thinsp;m/s)/s = 3&nbsp;N.\n\n===Conservation===\n[[File:Newtons cradle animation book 2.gif|right|thumb|A [[Newton's cradle]] demonstrates conservation of momentum.]]\nIn a [[closed system]] (one that does not exchange any matter with its surroundings and is not acted on by external forces) the total momentum is constant. This fact, known as the ''law of conservation of momentum'', is implied by [[Newton's laws of motion]].<ref name=FeynmanCh10>{{harvnb|Feynman Vol. 1|loc=Chapter 10}}</ref> Suppose, for example, that two particles interact. Because of the third law, the forces between them are equal and opposite. If the particles are numbered 1 and 2, the second law states that {{math|''F''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|''dp''<sub>1</sub>|''dt''}}}} and {{math|''F''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|''dp''<sub>2</sub>|''dt''}}}}. Therefore,\n:<math> \\frac{d p_1}{d t} = - \\frac{d p_2}{d t}, </math>\nwith the negative sign indicating that the forces oppose. Equivalently,\n:<math> \\frac{d}{d t} \\left(p_1+ p_2\\right)= 0. </math>\n\nIf the velocities of the particles are {{math|''u''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''u''<sub>2</sub>}} before the interaction, and afterwards they are {{math|''v''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''v''<sub>2</sub>}}, then\n:<math>m_1 u_{1} + m_2 u_{2} = m_1 v_{1} + m_2 v_{2}.</math>\n\nThis law holds no matter how complicated the force is between particles. Similarly, if there are several particles, the momentum exchanged between each pair of particles adds up to zero, so the total change in momentum is zero. This conservation law applies to all interactions, including [[collision]]s and separations caused by explosive forces.<ref name=FeynmanCh10/> It can also be generalized to situations where Newton's laws do not hold, for example in the [[theory of relativity]] and in [[Classical electromagnetism|electrodynamics]].<ref name=Goldstein54/>\n\n===Dependence on reference frame===\n[[File:Relativity an apple in a lift.svg|thumb|Newton's apple in Einstein's elevator. In person A's frame of reference, the apple has non-zero velocity and momentum. In the elevator's and person B's frames of reference, it has zero velocity and momentum.]]\nMomentum is a measurable quantity, and the measurement depends on the motion of the observer. For example: if an apple is sitting in a glass elevator that is descending, an outside observer, looking into the elevator, sees the apple moving, so, to that observer, the apple has a non-zero momentum. To someone inside the elevator, the apple does not move, so, it has zero momentum. The two observers each have a [[frame of reference]], in which, they observe motions, and, if the elevator is descending steadily, they will see behavior that is consistent with those same physical laws.\n\nSuppose a particle has position {{math|''x''}} in a stationary frame of reference. From the point of view of another frame of reference, moving at a uniform speed {{math|''u''}}, the position (represented by a primed coordinate) changes with time as\n:<math> x' = x - ut\\,.</math>\nThis is called a [[Galilean transformation]]. If the particle is moving at speed {{math|{{sfrac|''dx''|''dt''}} {{=}} ''v''}} in the first frame of reference, in the second, it is moving at speed\n:<math> v' = \\frac{dx'}{dt} = v-u\\,.</math>\nSince {{math|''u''}} does not change, the accelerations are the same:\n:<math> a' = \\frac{dv'}{dt} = a\\,.</math>\nThus, momentum is conserved in both reference frames. Moreover, as long as the force has the same form, in both frames, Newton's second law is unchanged. Forces such as Newtonian gravity, which depend only on the scalar distance between objects, satisfy this criterion. This independence of reference frame is called Newtonian relativity or [[Galilean invariance]].<ref>{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=276}}</ref>\n\nA change of reference frame, can, often, simplify calculations of motion. For example, in a collision of two particles, a reference frame can be chosen, where, one particle begins at rest. Another, commonly used reference frame, is the [[center of mass frame]] - one that is moving with the center of mass. In this frame,\nthe total momentum is zero.\n\n===Application to collisions===\nBy itself, the law of conservation of momentum is not enough to determine the motion of particles after a collision. Another property of the motion, [[kinetic energy]], must be known. This is not necessarily conserved. If it is conserved, the collision is called an ''[[elastic collision]]''; if not, it is an ''[[inelastic collision]]''.\n\n====Elastic collisions====\n{{Main|Elastic collision}}\n[[File:Elastischer sto\u00df.gif|thumb|right|Elastic collision of equal masses]]\n[[File:Elastischer sto\u00df3.gif|thumb|right|Elastic collision of unequal masses]]\nAn elastic collision is one in which no kinetic energy is lost. Perfectly elastic \"collisions\" can occur when the objects do not touch each other, as for example in atomic or nuclear scattering where electric repulsion keeps them apart. A [[gravity assist|slingshot maneuver]] of a satellite around a planet can also be viewed as a perfectly elastic collision from a distance. A collision between two [[Pool billiards|pool]] balls is a good example of an ''almost'' totally elastic collision, due to their high [[stiffness|rigidity]]; but when bodies come in contact there is always some [[dissipation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/elacol.html |title=Elastic and inelastic collisions |work=Hyperphysics |author=Carl Nave |date=2010 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nA head-on elastic collision between two bodies can be represented by velocities in one dimension, along a line passing through the bodies. If the velocities are {{math|''u''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''u''<sub>2</sub>}} before the collision and {{math|''v''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''v''<sub>2</sub>}} after, the equations expressing conservation of momentum and kinetic energy are:\n:<math>\\begin{align} m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 &= m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2\\\\\n\\tfrac{1}{2} m_1 u_1^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2} m_2 u_2^2 &= \\tfrac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \\tfrac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2\\,.\\end{align}</math>\n\nA change of reference frame can often simplify the analysis of a collision. For example, suppose there are two bodies of equal mass {{math|''m''}}, one stationary and one approaching the other at a speed {{math|''v''}} (as in the figure). The center of mass is moving at speed {{math|{{sfrac|''v''|2}}}} and both bodies are moving towards it at speed {{math|{{sfrac|''v''|2}}}}. Because of the symmetry, after the collision both must be moving away from the center of mass at the same speed. Adding the speed of the center of mass to both, we find that the body that was moving is now stopped and the other is moving away at speed {{math|''v''}}. The bodies have exchanged their velocities. Regardless of the velocities of the bodies, a switch to the center of mass frame leads us to the same conclusion. Therefore, the final velocities are given by<ref name=FeynmanCh10/>\n:<math>\\begin{align}  v_1 &= u_2\\\\\nv_2 &= u_1\\,. \\end{align}</math>\n \nIn general, when the initial velocities are known, the final velocities are given by<ref>{{cite book|last=Serway|first=Raymond A.|author2=John W.

Examples include [[traffic collisions]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/carcr.html#cc1 |title=Forces in car crashes |work=Hyperphysics |author=Carl Nave |date=2010 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref> in which the effect of lost kinetic energy can be seen in the damage to the vehicles; electrons losing some of their energy to atoms (as in the [[Franck\u2013Hertz experiment]]);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/FrHz.html |title=The Franck-Hertz Experiment |work=Hyperphysics |author=Carl Nave |date=2010 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref> and [[particle accelerator]]s in which the kinetic energy is converted into mass in the form of new particles.\n\nIn a perfectly inelastic collision (such as a bug hitting a windshield), both bodies have the same motion afterwards. If one body is motionless to begin with, the equation for conservation of momentum is\n:<math>m_1 u_1 = \\left( m_1 + m_2 \\right) v\\,,</math>\nso\n:<math> v = \\frac{m_1}{m_1+m_2} u_1\\,.</math>\nIn a frame of reference moving at the speed {{math|''v'')}}, the objects are brought to rest by the collision and 100% of the kinetic energy is converted.\n\nOne measure of the inelasticity of the collision is the [[coefficient of restitution]] {{math|''C''<sub>R</sub>}}, defined as the ratio of relative velocity of separation to relative velocity of approach. In applying this measure to ball sports, this can be easily measured using the following formula:<ref>{{cite book|last=McGinnis|first=Peter M.|title=Biomechanics of sport and exercise|date=2005|publisher=Human Kinetics|location=Champaign, IL [u.a.]|isbn=9780736051019|page=85|edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PrOKEcZXJ58C&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=coefficient+of+restitution+bounciness }}</ref>\n:<math>C_\\text{R} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{bounce height}}{\\text{drop height}}}\\,.</math>\n\nThe momentum and energy equations also apply to the motions of objects that begin together and then move apart. For example, an [[explosion]] is the result of a chain reaction that transforms potential energy stored in chemical, mechanical, or nuclear form into kinetic energy, acoustic energy, and electromagnetic radiation. [[Rocket]]s also make use of conservation of momentum: propellant is thrust outward,  gaining momentum, and an equal and opposite momentum is imparted to the rocket.<ref>{{Citation | last = Sutton | first = George | title = Rocket Propulsion Elements |edition=7th |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LQbDOxg3XZcC&printsec=frontcover | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | location = Chichester | date = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-471-32642-7 |chapter=1}}</ref>\n\n===Multiple dimensions===\n[[File:Elastischer sto\u00df 2D.gif|thumb|right|Two-dimensional elastic collision.

In a coordinate system with {{math|''x, y, z''}} axes, velocity has components {{math|''v''<sub>x</sub>}} in the {{math|''x''}} direction, {{math|''v''<sub>y</sub>}} in the {{math|''y''}} direction, {{math|''v''<sub>z</sub>}} in the {{math|''z''}} direction.

Often coordinates can be chosen so that only two components are needed, as in the figure. Each component can be obtained separately and the results combined to produce a vector result.<ref name=FeynmanCh11/>\n\nA simple construction involving the center of mass frame can be used to show that if a stationary elastic sphere is struck by a moving sphere, the two will head off at right angles after the collision (as in the figure).<ref>{{harvnb|Rindler|1986|pp=26&ndash;27}}</ref>\n\n=== Objects of variable mass ===\n\nThe concept of momentum plays a fundamental role in explaining the behavior of [[variable-mass system|variable-mass objects]] such as a [[rocket]] ejecting fuel or a [[star]] [[accretion (astrophysics)|accreting]] gas. In analyzing such an object, one treats the object's mass as a function that varies with time: {{math|''m''(''t'')}}. The momentum of the object at time {{math|''t''}} is therefore {{math|''p''(''t'') {{=}} ''m''(''t'')''v''(''t'')}}. One might then try to invoke Newton's second law of motion by saying that the external force {{math|''F''}} on the object is related to its momentum {{math|''p''(''t'')}} by {{math|''F'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''dp''|''dt''}}}}, but this is incorrect, as is the related expression found by applying the product rule to {{math|{{sfrac|''d''(''mv'')|''dt''}}}}:<ref name=\"kleppner135\">{{cite book|last1=Kleppner|last2=Kolenkow|title=An Introduction to Mechanics|page=135&ndash;39}}</ref>\n\n:<math> F = m(t) \\frac{dv}{dt} + v(t) \\frac{dm}{dt}. \\qquad \\mathrm{}</math> (incorrect)\nThis equation does not correctly describe the motion of variable-mass objects. The correct equation is\n:<math> F = m(t) \\frac{dv}{dt} - u \\frac{dm}{dt},</math>\nwhere {{math|''u''}} is the velocity of the ejected/accreted mass ''as seen in the object's rest frame''.<ref name=\"kleppner135\" /> This is distinct from {{math|''v''}}, which is the velocity of the object itself as seen in an inertial frame.\n\nThis equation is derived by keeping track of both the momentum of the object as well as the momentum of the ejected/accreted mass (dm). When considered together, the object and the mass (dm) constitute a closed system in which total momentum is conserved.\n\n:<math> P(t+dt) = ( m - dm ) ( v+dv) + dm ( v - u ) = mv+m dv - u dm = P(t) +m dv - u dm\n\\qquad \\mathrm{}</math>\n\n==Relativistic mechanics==\n{{See also|Mass in special relativity|Tests of relativistic energy and momentum}}\n\n===Lorentz invariance===\nNewtonian physics assumes that [[absolute time and space]] exist outside of any observer; this gives rise to the [[Galilean invariance]] described earlier. It also results in a prediction that the [[speed of light]] can vary from one reference frame to another. This is contrary to observation. In the [[special theory of relativity]], Einstein keeps the postulate that the equations of motion do not depend on the reference frame, but assumes that the speed of light {{math|''c''}} is invariant. As a result, position and time in two reference frames are related by the [[Lorentz transformation]] instead of the [[Galilean transformation]].<ref name=RindlerCh2>{{harvnb|Rindler|1986|loc=Chapter 2}}</ref>\n\nConsider, for example, a reference frame moving relative to another at velocity {{math|''v''}} in the {{math|''x''}} direction.

However, it can be made invariant by making the ''inertial mass'' {{math|''m''}} of an object a function of velocity:\n:<math>m = \\gamma m_0\\,;</math>\n{{math|''m''<sub>0</sub>}} is the object's [[invariant mass]].<ref name=Rindler>{{harvnb|Rindler|1986|pp=77&ndash;81}}</ref>\n\nThe modified momentum,\n:<math> \\mathbf{p} = \\gamma m_0 \\mathbf{v}\\,,</math>\nobeys Newton's second law:\n:<math> \\mathbf{F} = \\frac{d \\mathbf{p}}{dt}\\,.</math>\n\nWithin the domain of classical mechanics, relativistic momentum closely approximates Newtonian momentum: at low velocity, {{math|''\u03b3m''<sub>0</sub>'''v'''}} is approximately equal to {{math|''m''<sub>0</sub>'''v'''}}, the Newtonian expression for momentum.\n\n===Four-vector formulation===\n{{Main|Four-momentum}}\nIn the theory of special relativity, physical quantities are expressed in terms of [[four-vector]]s that include time as a fourth coordinate along with the three space coordinates. These vectors are generally represented by capital letters, for example {{math|'''R'''}} for position. The expression for the ''four-momentum'' depends on how the coordinates are expressed. Time may be given in its normal units or multiplied by the speed of light so that all the components of the four-vector have dimensions of length. If the latter scaling is used, an interval of [[proper time]], {{math|''&tau;''}}, defined by<ref>{{harvnb|Rindler|1986|p=66}}</ref>\n:<math>c^2d\\tau^2 = c^2dt^2-dx^2-dy^2-dz^2\\,,</math>\nis [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] under Lorentz transformations (in this expression and in what follows the {{nowrap|(+ \u2212 \u2212 \u2212)}} [[metric signature]] has been used, different authors use different conventions). Mathematically this invariance can be ensured in one of two ways: by treating the four-vectors as [[Euclidean vector]]s and multiplying time by [[Imaginary unit|{{math|{{sqrt|\u22121}}}}]]; or by keeping time a real quantity and embedding the vectors in a [[Minkowski space]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Misner|first=Charles W.|author2=Kip S.

Instead, the materials must be approximated by a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]] in which there is a particle or [[fluid parcel]] at each point that is assigned the average of the properties of atoms in a small region nearby. In particular, it has a density {{math|''&rho;''}} and velocity {{math|'''v'''}} that depend on time {{math|''t''}} and position {{math|'''r'''}}.

All the forces on the water are in balance and the water is motionless. On any given drop of water, two forces are balanced. The first is gravity, which acts directly on each atom and molecule inside. The gravitational force per unit volume is {{math|''&rho;'''''g'''}}, where {{math|'''g'''}} is the [[gravitational acceleration]]. The second force is the sum of all the forces exerted on its surface by the surrounding water. The force from below is greater than the force from above by just the amount needed to balance gravity. The normal force per unit area is the [[pressure]] {{math|''p''}}. The average force per unit volume inside the droplet is the gradient of the pressure, so the force balance equation is<ref name=FeynmanCh40>{{harvnb|Feynman Vol. 2|loc=Chapter 40}}</ref>\n:<math>-\\nabla p +\\rho \\mathbf{g} = 0\\,.</math>\n\nIf the forces are not balanced, the droplet accelerates.

This is equal to the net force on the droplet.\n\nForces that can change the momentum of a droplet include the gradient of the pressure and gravity, as above. In addition, surface forces can deform the droplet. In the simplest case, a [[shear stress]] {{math|''&tau;''}}, exerted by a force parallel to the surface of the droplet, is proportional to the rate of deformation or [[strain rate]]. Such a shear stress occurs if the fluid has a velocity gradient because the fluid is moving faster on one side than another.

For example, a thrown ball must be kept moving by motions of the air.  Most writers continued to accept Aristotle's theory until the time of Galileo, but a few were skeptical. Philoponus pointed out the absurdity in Aristotle's claim that motion of an object is promoted by the same air that is resisting its passage. He proposed instead that an impetus was imparted to the object in the act of throwing it.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/#2.1 |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title=John Philoponus |date=8 June 2007 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}</ref> Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (also known by his Latinized name [[Avicenna]]) read Philoponus and published his own theory of motion in ''The Book of Healing'' in 1020. He agreed that an impetus is imparted to a projectile by the thrower; but unlike Philoponus, who believed that it was a temporary virtue that would decline even in a vacuum, he viewed it as a persistent, requiring external forces such as [[air resistance]] to dissipate it.<ref name=Espinoza>{{cite journal | last1 = Espinoza | first1 = Fernando  | date = 2005 | title = An analysis of the historical development of ideas about motion and its implications for teaching | url = | journal = Physics Education | volume = 40 | issue = 2| page = 141 | doi=10.1088/0031-9120/40/2/002|bibcode = 2005PhyEd..40..139E }}</ref><ref name=Nasr>{{Cite book |title=The Islamic intellectual tradition in Persia |author=[[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] & Mehdi Amin Razavi |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=1996 |isbn=0-7007-0314-4 |page=72}}</ref><ref name=Sayili>{{cite journal\n|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb37219.x\n|author=[[Aydin Sayili]]\n|date=1987\n|title=Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 and Buridan on the Motion of the Projectile\n|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences\n|volume=500\n|issue=1\n|pages=477&ndash;482\n|quote=\n|bibcode=1987NYASA.500..477S}}</ref> \nThe work of Philoponus, and possibly that of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101,<ref name=Sayili/> was read and refined by the European philosophers [[Peter Olivi]] and [[Jean Buridan]]. Buridan, who in about 1350 was made rector of the University of Paris, referred to [[Theory of impetus|impetus]] being proportional to the weight times the speed. Moreover, Buridan's theory was different from his predecessor's in that he did not consider impetus to be self-dissipating, asserting that a body would be arrested by the forces of air resistance and gravity which might be opposing its impetus.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Medieval Science, Technology and Medicine:an Encyclopedia |page=107 |title=Buridian, John |author=T.F.

This should not be read as a statement of the modern law of momentum, since he had no concept of mass as distinct from weight and size, and more importantly he believed that it is speed rather than velocity that is conserved. So for Descartes if a moving object were to bounce off a surface, changing its direction but not its speed, there would be no change in its quantity of motion.<ref>{{Cite book\n|author=Daniel Garber\n|editor=John Cottingham\n|chapter=Descartes' Physics\n|pages=310\u2013319\n|title=The Cambridge Companion to Descartes\n|date=1992\n|place=Cambridge\n|publisher=Cambridge University Press\n|isbn=0-521-36696-8\n|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Rothman|first=Milton A.|title=Discovering the natural laws : the experimental basis of physics|date=1989|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=9780486261782|pages=83&ndash;88|edition=2nd}}</ref>  [[Galileo]], later, in his ''[[Two New Sciences]]'', used the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''impeto''.\n\n[[Leibniz]], in his \"[[Discourse on Metaphysics]]\", gave an argument against Descartes' construction of the conservation of the \"quantity of motion\" using an example of dropping blocks of different sizes different distances.
