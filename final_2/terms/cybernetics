Cybernetics is relevant to, for example, mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive, and [[social systems]]. The essential goal of the broad field of cybernetics is to understand and define the functions and processes of systems that have goals and that participate in circular, [[causality|causal chains]] that move from action to sensing to comparison with desired goal, and again to action.

Contemporary cybernetics began as an interdisciplinary study connecting the fields of [[control systems]], [[circuit theory|electrical network theory]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[logic modeling]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[anthropology]], and [[psychology]] in the 1940s, often attributed to the [[Macy Conferences]]. During the second half of the 20th century cybernetics evolved in ways that distinguish first-order cybernetics (about observed systems) from [[second-order cybernetics]] (about observing systems).<ref name=HvF1981>Heinz von Foerster (1981), 'Observing Systems\", Intersystems Publications, Seaside, CA.  {{OCLC|263576422}}</ref> More recently there is talk about a third-order cybernetics (doing in ways that embraces first and second-order).<ref name=\"3rd--order cybernetics\">{{cite journal|last=Kenny|first=Vincent|title=There's Nothing Like the Real Thing\".

Duke University Press:  1991.</ref> French physicist and mathematician [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]] first coined the word \"cybernetique\" in his 1834 essay ''Essai sur la philosophie des sciences'' to describe the science of civil government.<ref>[[H.S. Tsien]] Engineering Cybernetics, Preface vii, 1954  McGraw Hill</ref> The term was borrowed by [[Norbert Wiener]], in his book ''[[Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine|Cybernetics]]'', to define the study of control and communication in the animal and the machine.<ref>Norbert Wiener, [[Cybernetics or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine]], 1948  MIT Press</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Roots of cybernetic theory===\nThe word ''cybernetics'' was first used in the context of \"the study of self-governance\"  by [[Plato]] in [[First Alcibiades|''The Alcibiades'']] to signify the [[governance]] of people.<ref name=\"Johnson\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jurlandia.org/cybsoc.htm |author=Johnson, Barnabas |title=The Cybernetics of Society |accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref> The word 'cybern\u00e9tique' was also used in 1834 by the physicist [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]] (1775\u20131836) to denote the sciences of government in his classification system of human knowledge.\n[[File:James Watt.jpg|thumb|upright|James Watt]] \n\nThe first artificial automatic regulatory system was a [[water clock]], invented by the mechanician [[Ktesibios]]; based on a tank which poured water into a reservoir before using it to run the mechanism, it used a cone-shaped float to monitor the level of the water in its reservoir and adjust the rate of flow of the water accordingly to maintain a constant level of water in the reservoir.  This was the first artificial truly automatic self-regulatory device that required no outside intervention between the feedback and the controls of the mechanism.  Although they considered this part of engineering (the use of the term ''cybernetics'' is much posterior), [[Ktesibios]] and others such as [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron]] and [[Su Song]] are considered to be some of the first to study cybernetic principles.\n\nThe study of ''[[Teleology|teleological]] mechanisms'' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 or ''telos'' for ''end'', ''goal'', or ''purpose'') in machines with ''corrective feedback'' dates from as far back as the late 18th century when [[James Watt (inventor)|James Watt]]'s steam engine was equipped with a [[governor (device)|governor]] (1775-1800), a centrifugal feedback valve for controlling the speed of the engine. [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] identified this as the principle of [[evolution]] in his famous 1858 paper.<ref>http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S043.htm</ref> In 1868 [[James Clerk Maxwell]] published a theoretical article on governors, one of the first to discuss and refine the principles of self-regulating devices. [[Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll]] applied the feedback mechanism via his model of functional cycle (''Funktionskreis'') in order to explain animal behaviour and the origins of meaning in general.\n\n===Early 20th century===\nContemporary cybernetics began as an interdisciplinary study connecting the fields of [[control systems]], [[Circuit theory|electrical network theory]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[logic modeling]], [[evolutionary biology]] and [[neuroscience]] in the 1940s; the ideas are also related to the biological work of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] in General Systems Theory.  Electronic control systems originated with the 1927 work of [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] engineer [[Harold Stephen Black|Harold S. Black]] on using [[negative feedback]] to control amplifiers. \n\nEarly applications of negative feedback in electronic circuits included the control of gun mounts and radar antenna during [[World War II]].  The founder of [[System Dynamics]], [[Jay Wright Forrester|Jay Forrester]], during WWII a graduate student at the Servomechanisms Laboratory at MIT, working with [[Gordon S. Brown]] to develop electronic control systems for the U.S. Navy later applied these ideas to social organizations such as corporations and cities as an original organizer of the MIT School of Industrial Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management. \n\n[[W. Edwards Deming]], the [[Total Quality Management]] guru for whom Japan named its top post-WWII industrial [[Deming Prize|prize]], was an intern at [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Labs]] in 1927 and may have been influenced by [[network theory]]; Deming made \"Understanding Systems\" one of the four pillars of what he described as \"Profound Knowledge\" in his book \"The New Economics.\"\n\nNumerous papers spearheaded the coalescing of the field. In 1935 Russian physiologist [[Pyotr Anokhin|P. K. Anokhin]] published a book in which the concept of feedback (\"back afferentation\") was studied. The study and mathematical modelling of regulatory processes became a continuing research effort and two key articles were published in 1943: \"Behavior, Purpose and Teleology\" by [[Arturo Rosenblueth]], Norbert Wiener, and [[Julian Bigelow]]; and the paper \"A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity\" by [[Warren McCulloch]] and [[Walter Pitts]].\n\nIn 1936, [[\u0218tefan Odobleja]] publishes \"Phonoscopy and the clinical semiotics\". In 1937, he participates in the IX International Congress of Military Medicine with \"Demonstration de phonoscopie\"; in the paper he disseminates a prospectus announcing his future work, \"Psychologie consonantiste\", the most important of his writings, where he lays the theoretical foundations of generalized cybernetics. The book, published in Paris by \"Librairie Maloine\" (vol. I in 1938 and vol. II in 1939), contains almost 900 pages and includes 300 figures in the text. The author wrote at the time that \"this book is... a table of contents, an index or a dictionary of psychology, [for] a ... great Treatise of Psychology that should contain 20\u201330 volumes\". Due to the beginning of World War II, the publication went unnoticed (the first Romanian edition of this work did not appear until 1982).\n\nCybernetics as a discipline was firmly established by [[Norbert Wiener]], [[Warren Sturgis McCulloch|McCulloch]] and others, such as [[W. Ross Ashby]], mathematician [[Alan Turing]], and [[William Grey Walter|W. Grey Walter]] (one of the first to build autonomous robots as an aid to the study of animal behaviour).  In the spring of 1947, Wiener was invited to a congress on harmonic analysis, held in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] ([[France]] was an important geographical locus of early cybernetics together with the [[United States|US]] and [[United Kingdom|UK]]); the event was organized by the [[Bourbaki]], a French scientific society, and mathematician [[Szolem Mandelbrojt]] (1899\u20131983), uncle of the world-famous mathematician [[Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot]].  During this stay in France, Wiener received the offer to write a manuscript on the unifying character of this part of applied mathematics, which is found in the study of [[Brownian motion]] and in telecommunication engineering. The following summer, back in the United States, Wiener decided to introduce the neologism ''cybernetics'', coined to denote the study of \"teleological mechanisms\", into his scientific theory: it was popularized through his book ''[[Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine]]'' (MIT Press/John Wiley and Sons, NY, 1948). In the UK this became the focus for the [[Ratio Club]].\n\n[[File:JohnvonNeumann-LosAlamos.gif|thumb|upright|John von Neumann]]\nIn the early 1940s [[John von Neumann]], although better known for his work in mathematics and computer science, did contribute a unique and unusual addition to the world of cybernetics: [[von Neumann cellular automata]], and their logical follow up, the [[von Neumann Universal Constructor]].  The result of these deceptively simple thought-experiments was the concept of [[self replication]], which cybernetics adopted as a core concept.  The concept that the same properties of genetic reproduction applied to social [[memes]], living cells, and even computer viruses is further proof of the somewhat surprising universality of cybernetic study.\n\nIn 1950, Wiener popularized the social implications of cybernetics, drawing analogies between automatic systems (such as a regulated steam engine) and human institutions in his best-selling ''[[The Human Use of Human Beings]]: Cybernetics and Society'' (Houghton-Mifflin).\n\nWhile not the only instance of a research organization focused on cybernetics, the Biological Computer Lab at the University of Illinois, Urbana/Champaign, under the direction of [[Heinz von Foerster]], was a major center of cybernetic research for almost 20 years, beginning in 1958.\n\n===Split from artificial intelligence===\n[[Artificial intelligence]] (AI) was founded as a distinct discipline at the [[Dartmouth Conferences]]. After some uneasy coexistence, AI gained funding and prominence. Consequently, cybernetic sciences such as the study of [[artificial neural network]]s were downplayed; the discipline shifted into the world of social sciences and therapy.<ref name=Cariani2010>{{cite journal|last=Cariani|first=Peter|title=on the importance of being emergent|journal=Constructivist Foundations|date=15 March 2010|volume=5|issue=2|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/constructivism/journal/5/2/086.cariani|accessdate=13 August 2012|page=89|quote=artificial intelligence was born at a conference at dartmouth in 1956 that was organized by McCarthy, Minsky, rochester, and shannon, three years after the Macy conferences on cybernetics had ended (Boden 2006; McCorduck 1972). The two movements coexisted for roughly a de- cade, but by the mid-1960s, the proponents of symbolic ai gained control of national funding conduits and ruthlessly defunded cybernetics research. This effectively liquidated the subfields of self-organizing systems, neural networks and adaptive machines, evolutionary programming, biological computation, and bionics for several decades, leaving the workers in management, therapy and the social sciences to carry the torch. i think some of the polemical pushing-and-shoving between first-order control theorists and second-order crowds that i witnessed in subsequent decades was the cumulative result of a shift of funding, membership, and research from the \"hard\" natural sciences to \"soft\" socio-psychological interventions.}}</ref>\n\nProminent cyberneticians during this period include [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[Axel Berg (cybernetician)|Aksel Berg]].\n\n===New cybernetics===\nIn the 1970s, [[new cybernetics|new cyberneticians]] emerged in multiple fields, but especially in [[biology]]. The ideas of [[Humberto Maturana|Maturana]], [[Francisco Varela|Varela]] and [[Henri Atlan|Atlan]], according to Jean-Pierre Dupuy (1986) \"realized that the cybernetic metaphors of the program upon which molecular biology had been based rendered a conception of the autonomy of the living being impossible. Consequently, these thinkers were led to invent a new cybernetics, one more suited to the organizations which mankind discovers in nature - organizations he has not himself invented\".<ref name=\"JPD86\">Jean-Pierre Dupuy, \"The autonomy of social reality: on the contribution of systems theory to the theory of society\" in: Elias L. Khalil & [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] eds., ''Evolution, Order and Complexity'', 1986.</ref> However, during the 1980s the question of whether the features of this new cybernetics could be applied to social forms of organization remained open to debate.<ref name=\"JPD86\"/>\n\nIn [[political science]], [[Project Cybersyn]] attempted to introduce a cybernetically controlled economy during the early 1970s.  In the 1980s, according to Harries-Jones (1988) \"unlike its predecessor, the new cybernetics concerns itself with the interaction of autonomous political [[actor]]s and subgroups, and the practical and reflexive consciousness of the subjects who produce and reproduce the structure of a political community. A dominant consideration is that of recursiveness, or self-reference of political action both with regards to the expression of political consciousness and with the ways in which systems build upon themselves\".<ref name = \"PHJ 88\">Peter Harries-Jones (1988), \"The Self-Organizing Polity: An Epistemological Analysis of Political Life by Laurent Dobuzinskis\" in: ''Canadian Journal of Political Science'' (Revue canadienne de science politique), Vol. 21, No. 2 (Jun., 1988), pp. 431-433.</ref>\n\nOne characteristic of the emerging new cybernetics considered in that time by [[Felix Geyer]] and [[Hans van der Zouwen]], according to Bailey (1994),<ref name = \"KB 94\">[[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Kenneth D. Bailey]] (1994), ''Sociology and the New Systems Theory: Toward a Theoretical Synthesis'', p.163.</ref> was \"that it views information as constructed and reconstructed by an individual interacting with the environment. This provides an [[epistemology|epistemological]] foundation of science, by viewing it as observer-dependent. Another characteristic of the new cybernetics is its contribution towards bridging the ''micro-macro gap''. That is, it links the individual with the society\".<ref name = \"KB 94\"/> Another characteristic noted was the \"transition from classical cybernetics to the new cybernetics [that] involves a transition from classical problems to new problems. These shifts in thinking involve, among others, (a) a change from emphasis on the system being steered to the system doing the steering, and the factor which guides the steering decisions; and (b) new emphasis on communication between several systems which are trying to steer each other\".<ref name = \"KB 94\"/>\n\nRecent endeavors into the true focus of cybernetics, systems of control and emergent behavior, by such related fields as [[game theory]] (the analysis of group interaction), [[evolutionarily stable strategy|systems of feedback in evolution]], and [[metamaterials]] (the study of materials with properties beyond the Newtonian properties of their constituent atoms), have led to a revived interest in this increasingly relevant field.<ref name=\"Kelly\"/>\n\n===Cybernetics and economic systems===\n{{Economic systems sidebar |Coordination}}\nThe design of self-regulating control systems for a real-time planned economy was explored by [[Viktor Glushkov]] in the former [[Soviet Union]] during the 1960s.

Education, sustainable development, social justice disciplines interact in a causal circular relationship that education would contribute to the development of the local community in Sinai village, on both sustainability and  social responsibility levels while the community itself provides a unique  learning environment that will contribute to the development of the educational program in a closed signaling loop.\n\n===In art===\n[[Nicolas Sch\u00f6ffer]]'s ''CYSP I'' (1956) was perhaps the first artwork to explicitly employ cybernetic principles (CYSP is an acronym that joins the first two letters of the words \"CYbernetic\" and \"SPatiodynamic\").<ref>{{cite web|title=CYSP I, the first cybernetic sculpture of art's history|url=http://www.olats.org/schoffer/cyspe.htm|publisher=Leonardo/OLATS - Observatoire Leonardo des arts et des technosciences}}</ref> The artist [[Roy Ascott]] elaborated an extensive theory of cybernetic art in  \"Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision\" (Cybernetica, Journal of the International Association for Cybernetics (Namur), Volume IX, No.4, 1966; Volume X No.1, 1967) and in \"The Cybernetic Stance: My Process and Purpose\" (Leonardo Vol 1, No 2, 1968).
