A built-up [[electric field]] resists the change of voltage on the element, while a [[magnetic field]] resists the change of current. The notion of reactance is similar to [[electrical resistance]], but it differs in several respects.\n\nIn [[phasor]] analysis, reactance is used to compute amplitude and phase changes of [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] [[alternating current]] going through a circuit element.  It is denoted by the symbol <math>\\scriptstyle{X}</math>. An ideal [[resistor]] has zero reactance, whereas ideal [[inductor]]s and [[capacitor]]s have zero resistance &ndash; that is, respond to current only by reactance. The magnitude of the reactance of an inductor rises in proportion to a rise in frequency, while the  magnitude of the reactance of a capacitor decreases in proportion to a rise in frequency (or increases in proportion to wavelength). As frequency goes up, inductive reactance goes up and capacitive reactance goes down. \n\n== Capacitive reactance ==\n{{main|Capacitance}}\nA capacitor consists of two [[Electrical conduction|conductor]]s separated by an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]], also known as a [[dielectric]].\n\n''Capacitive reactance'' is an opposition to the change of voltage across an element. Capacitive reactance <math>\\scriptstyle{X_C}</math> is [[inversely proportional]] to the signal [[frequency]] <math>\\scriptstyle{f}</math> (or [[angular frequency]] \u03c9) and the [[capacitance]] <math>\\scriptstyle{C}</math>.<ref name=\"Irwin\">Irwin, D. (2002). ''Basic Engineering Circuit Analysis'', page 274. New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.</ref>\n\nThere are two choices in the literature for defining reactance for a capacitor. One is to use a uniform notion of reactance as the imaginary part of impedance, in which case the reactance of a capacitor is a negative number:<ref name=\"Irwin\"/><ref>Hayt, W.H., Kimmerly J.E. (2007). ''Engineering Circuit Analysis'', 7th ed., McGraw-Hill, p. 388</ref><ref name=\"Glisson\">Glisson, T.H. (2011). ''Introduction to Circuit Analysis and Design'', Springer, p. 408</ref>\n\n:<math>X_C = -\\frac {1} {\\omega C} = -\\frac {1} {2\\pi f C}</math>\n\nAnother choice is to define capacitive reactance as a positive number,<ref>Horowitz P., Hill W.

When the [[potential]] associated with the charge exactly balances the applied voltage, the current goes to zero.\n\nDriven by an AC supply (ideal AC current source), a capacitor will only accumulate a limited amount of charge before the potential difference changes polarity and the charge is returned to the source.  The higher the frequency, the less charge will accumulate and the smaller the opposition to the current.\n\n== Inductive reactance ==\n{{main|Inductance}}\n\nInductive reactance is a property exhibited by an inductor, and inductive reactance exists based on the fact that an electric current produces a magnetic field around it. In the context of an AC circuit (although this concept applies any time current is changing), this magnetic field is constantly changing as a result of current that oscillates back and forth. It is this change in magnetic field that induces another electric current to flow in the same wire, in a direction such as to oppose the flow of the current originally responsible for producing the magnetic field (known as Lenz\u2019s Law). Hence, ''inductive reactance'' is an opposition to the change of current through an element. \n\nFor an ideal inductor in an AC circuit, the inhibitive effect on change in current flow results in a delay, or a phase shift, of the alternating current with respect to alternating voltage. Specifically, an ideal inductor (with no resistance) will cause the current to lag the voltage by a quarter cycle, or 90\u00b0. \n\nIn electric power systems, inductive reactance (and capacitive reactance, however inductive reactance is more common) can limit the power capacity of an AC transmission line, because power is not completely transferred when voltage and current are out-of-phase (detailed above). That is, current will flow for an out-of-phase system, however real power at certain times will not be transferred, because there will be points during which instantaneous current is positive while instantaneous voltage is negative, or vice versa, implying negative power transfer. Hence, real work is not performed when power transfer is \u201cnegative\u201d. However, current still flows even when a system is out-of-phase, which causes transmission lines to heat up due to current flow. Consequently, transmission lines can only heat up so much (or else they would physically \"sag\" too much), so transmission line operators have a \u201cceiling\u201d on the amount of current that can flow through a given line, and excessive inductive reactance can limit the power capacity of a line.\n\nInductive reactance <math>\\scriptstyle{X_L}</math> is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the sinusoidal signal [[frequency]] <math>\\scriptstyle{f}</math> and the [[inductance]] <math>\\scriptstyle{L}</math>, which depends on the physical shape of the inductor.\n:<math>X_L = \\omega L = 2\\pi f L</math>\n\nThe average current flowing through an [[inductance]] <math>\\scriptstyle{L}</math> in series with a [[sinusoidal]] AC voltage source of RMS [[amplitude]] <math>\\scriptstyle{A}</math> and frequency <math>\\scriptstyle{f}</math> is equal to:\n:<math>I_L = {A \\over \\omega L} = {A \\over 2\\pi f L}.</math>\n\nBecause a [[square wave]] has multiple amplitudes at sinusoidal [[harmonic]]s, the average current flowing through an [[inductance]] <math>\\scriptstyle{L}</math> in series with a square wave AC voltage source of RMS [[amplitude]] <math>\\scriptstyle{A}</math> and frequency <math>\\scriptstyle{f}</math> is equal to:\n:<math>I_L = {A \\pi^2 \\over 8 \\omega L} = {A\\pi \\over 16 f L}</math>\nmaking it appear as if the inductive reactance to a square wave was about 19% smaller <math>X_L = {16 \\over \\pi} f L</math>  than the reactance to the AC sine wave:\n\nAny conductor of finite dimensions has inductance; the inductance is made larger by the multiple turns in an [[electromagnetic coil]].  [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]] of electromagnetic induction gives the counter-[[Electromotive force|emf]] <math>\\scriptstyle{\\mathcal{E}}</math> (voltage opposing current) due to a rate-of-change of [[magnetic flux density]] <math>\\scriptstyle{B}</math> through a current loop.\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{E} = -{{d\\Phi_B} \\over dt}</math>\n\nFor an inductor consisting of a coil with <math>\\scriptstyle N</math> loops this gives.\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{E} = -N{d\\Phi_B \\over dt}</math>\n\nThe counter-emf is the source of the opposition to current flow.  A constant [[direct current]] has a zero rate-of-change, and sees an inductor as a [[short-circuit]] (it is typically made from a material with a low [[resistivity]]).  An [[alternating current]] has a time-averaged rate-of-change  that is proportional to frequency, this causes the increase in inductive reactance with frequency.\n\n== Impedance ==\n{{main|Electrical impedance}}\nBoth reactance <math>\\scriptstyle{X}</math> and [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] <math>\\scriptstyle{R}</math> are components of [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] <math>\\scriptstyle{Z}</math>.\n:<math>Z = R + jX</math>\nwhere:\n*<math>Z</math> is the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], measured in [[ohm]]s;\n*<math>R</math> is the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], measured in ohms. It is the real part of the impedance: <math>{R=\\Re{(Z)}}</math>\n*<math>X</math> is the reactance, measured in ohms. It is the imaginary part of the impedance: <math>{X=\\Im{(Z)}}</math>\n*<math>j</math> is the [[square root of minus one]], usually represented by <math>i</math> in non-electrical formulas (<math>j</math> is used so as not to confuse the imaginary unit with current, commonly represented by <math>i</math>).\n\nWhen both a capacitor and an inductor are placed in series in a circuit, their contributions to the total circuit impedance are opposite. Capacitive reactance <math>\\scriptstyle{X_C}</math> and inductive reactance <math>\\scriptstyle{X_L}</math> contribute to the total reactance <math>\\scriptstyle{X}</math> as follows.\n:<math>{X = X_L + X_C = \\omega L -\\frac {1} {\\omega C}}</math>\nwhere:\n*<math>\\scriptstyle{X_L}</math> is the [[Inductance|inductive]] reactance, measured in ohms;\n*<math>\\scriptstyle{X_C}</math> is the [[Capacitance|capacitive]] reactance, measured in ohms;\n*<math>\\omega</math> is the angular frequency, <math>2\\pi</math> times the frequency in Hz.\n\nHence:<ref name=\"Glisson\"/>\n*if <math>\\scriptstyle X > 0</math>, the total reactance is said to be inductive;\n*if <math>\\scriptstyle X = 0</math>, then the impedance is purely resistive;\n*if <math>\\scriptstyle X < 0</math>, the total reactance is said to be capacitive.\n\nNote however that if <math>\\scriptstyle{X_L}</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle{X_C}</math> are assumed both positive by definition, then the intermediary formula changes to a difference:<ref name=\"Hughes\"/>\n\n:<math>{X = X_L - X_C = \\omega L -\\frac {1} {\\omega C}}</math>\n\nbut the ultimate value is the same.\n\n=== Phase relationship ===\n\nThe phase of the voltage across a purely reactive device (a capacitor with an infinite resistance or an inductor with a resistance of zero) ''lags'' the current by <math>\\scriptstyle{\\pi/2}</math> radians for a capacitive reactance and ''leads'' the current by <math>\\scriptstyle{\\pi/2}</math> radians for an inductive reactance. Without knowledge of both the resistance and reactance the relationship between voltage and current cannot be determined.\n\nThe origin of the different signs for capacitive and inductive reactance is the phase factor <math>e^{\\pm j{\\pi \\over 2}}</math> in the impedance.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\tilde{Z}_C &= {1 \\over \\omega C}e^{j(-{\\pi \\over 2})} = j\\left({ -\\frac{1}{\\omega C}}\\right) = jX_C \\\\\n  \\tilde{Z}_L &= \\omega Le^{j{\\pi \\over 2}} = j\\omega L = jX_L\\quad\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nFor a reactive component the sinusoidal voltage across the component is in quadrature (a <math>\\scriptstyle{\\pi/2}</math> phase difference) with the sinusoidal current through the component. The component alternately absorbs energy from the circuit and then returns energy to the circuit, thus a pure reactance does not dissipate power.\n\n== References ==\n# Shamieh C. and McComb G., ''Electronics for Dummies,'' John Wiley & Sons, 2011.\n# Meade R., ''Foundations of Electronics,'' Cengage Learning, 2002.\n# {{cite book | author = Young, Hugh D. |author2=Roger A.
