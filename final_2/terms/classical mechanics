Classical mechanics is concerned with the set of [[physical law]]s describing the motion of [[physical body|bodies]] under the influence of a system of [[force]]s. The study of the motion of bodies is an ancient one, making classical mechanics one of the oldest and largest subjects in [[science]], [[engineering]] and [[technology]]. It is also widely known as '''Newtonian mechanics'''.\n\nClassical mechanics describes the motion of [[macroscopic]] objects, from [[projectile]]s to parts of [[machine (mechanical)|machinery]], as well as [[astronomical objects]], such as [[spacecraft]], [[planets]], [[star]]s, and [[galaxies]]. Within classical mechanics are fields of study that describe the behavior of [[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s and [[gas]]es and other specific sub-topics. Classical mechanics also provides extremely accurate results as long as the domain of study is restricted to large objects and the speeds involved do not approach the [[speed of light]]. When the objects being examined are sufficiently small, it becomes necessary to introduce the other major sub-field of mechanics, quantum mechanics, which adjusts the laws of physics of macroscopic objects for the [[Atomic model|atomic nature of matter]] by including the [[wave\u2013particle duality]] of [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s. When both quantum mechanics and classical mechanics cannot apply, such as at the quantum level with high speeds, [[quantum field theory]] (QFT) becomes applicable.\n\nThe term ''classical mechanics'' was coined in the early 20th century to describe the system of physics begun by [[Isaac Newton]] and many contemporary 17th century [[natural philosophers]], and is built upon the earlier astronomical theories of [[Johannes Kepler]], which in turn were based on the precise observations of [[Tycho Brahe]] and the studies of terrestrial [[projectile motion]] of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]. Since these aspects of physics were developed long before the emergence of [[quantum physics]] and relativity, some sources exclude Einstein's [[theory of relativity]] from this category. However, a number of modern sources ''do'' include relativistic mechanics, which in their view represents ''classical mechanics'' in its most developed and most accurate form.<ref group=note>\n\nThe notion of \"classical\" may be somewhat confusing, insofar as this term usually refers to the era of [[classical antiquity]] in [[European history]]. While many discoveries within the [[mathematics]] of that period are applicable today and of great use, much of the science that emerged then has since been superseded by more accurate models. This in no way detracts from the science of that time because most of modern physics is built directly upon those developments. The emergence of classical mechanics was a decisive stage in the development of [[science]], in the modern sense of the term. Above all, what characterizes it is its insistence that the descriptions of the behavior of bodies be placed on a more exacting basis that could only be provided by a [[mathematical]] treatment and its reliance on [[experiment]], rather than [[speculative reason|speculation]]. Classical mechanics established the means of predicting in a quantitative manner the behavior of objects, and how to test them by carefully designed [[measurement]]. The emerging globally cooperative endeavor increasingly provided for much closer scrutiny and testing, both of theory and experiment. This was, and remains, a key factor in establishing certain knowledge, and in bringing it to the service of society. History shows how closely the health and wealth of a society depends on nurturing this investigative and critical approach.</ref> <!--This view seems to be very useful as an aside note, as in \"for further information\". -->\n\nThe earliest development of classical mechanics is often referred to as Newtonian mechanics, and is associated with the physical concepts employed by and the mathematical methods invented by Newton, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and others. Later, more abstract and general methods were developed, leading to reformulations of classical mechanics known as [[Lagrangian mechanics]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]. These advances were largely made in the 18th and 19th centuries, and they extend substantially beyond Newton's work, particularly through their use of [[analytical mechanics]].\n\n==Description of the theory==\n[[File:Tir parab\u00f2lic.png|thumb|alt=diagram of parabolic projectile motion|The analysis of projectile motion is a part of classical mechanics.]]\nThe following introduces the basic concepts of classical mechanics. For simplicity, it often models real-world objects as [[point particle]]s (objects with negligible size). The motion of a point particle is characterized by a small number of [[parameter]]s: its position, [[mass]], and the [[force]]s applied to it. Each of these parameters is discussed in turn.\n\nIn reality, the kind of objects that classical mechanics can describe always have a [[0 (number)|non-zero]] size. (The physics of ''very'' small particles, such as the [[electron]], is more accurately described by [[quantum mechanics]].) Objects with non-zero size have more complicated behavior than hypothetical point particles, because of the additional [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]: a [[baseball]] can [[rotation|spin]] while it is moving, for example. However, the results for point particles can be used to study such objects by treating them as [[wikt:Composite|composite]] objects, made of a large number of collectively acting point particles. The [[center of mass]] of a composite object behaves like a point particle.\n\nClassical mechanics uses [[common-sense]] notions of how matter and forces exist and interact. It assumes that matter and energy have definite, knowable attributes such as where an object is in space and its speed. Non-relativistic mechanics also assumes that forces act instantaneously (see also [[Action at a distance]]).\n{{clearright}}\n\n===Position and its derivatives===\n{{Main|Kinematics}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|+ The [[SI]] derived \"mechanical\"<br>(that is, not [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] or [[Thermal physics|thermal]])<br>units with kg, m and [[second|s]]\n|-\n|position||m\n|-\n|angular position/[[angle]]||unitless (radian)\n|-\n|[[velocity]]||m\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>\n|-\n|[[angular velocity]]||s<sup>\u22121</sup>\n|-\n|[[acceleration]]||m\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>\n|-\n|[[angular acceleration]]||s<sup>\u22122</sup>\n|-\n|[[Jerk (physics)|jerk]]||m\u00b7s<sup>\u22123</sup>\n|-\n|\"angular jerk\"||s<sup>\u22123</sup>\n|-\n|[[specific energy]]||m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>\n|-\n|absorbed dose rate||m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22123</sup>\n|-\n|[[moment of inertia]]||kg\u00b7m<sup>2</sup>\n|-\n|[[momentum]]||kg\u00b7m\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>\n|-\n|[[angular momentum]]||kg\u00b7m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>\n|-\n|[[force]]||kg\u00b7m\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>\n|-\n|[[torque]]||kg\u00b7m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>\n|-\n|[[energy]]||kg\u00b7m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>\n|-\n|[[Power (physics)|power]]||kg\u00b7m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22123</sup>\n|-\n|[[pressure]] and [[energy density]]||kg\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>\n|-\n|[[surface tension]]||kg\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>\n|-\n|[[spring constant]]||kg\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>\n|-\n|[[irradiance]] and [[energy flux]]||kg\u00b7s<sup>\u22123</sup>\n|-\n|[[kinematic viscosity]]||m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>\n|-\n|[[dynamic viscosity]]||kg\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>\n|-\n|[[density]] (mass density)||kg\u00b7m<sup>\u22123</sup>\n|-\n|[[density]] (weight density)||kg\u00b7m<sup>\u22122</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>\n|-\n|[[number density]]||m<sup>\u22123</sup>\n|-\n|[[Action (physics)|action]]||kg\u00b7m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22121</sup>\n|}\nThe ''position'' of a [[point particle]] is defined with respect to an arbitrary fixed reference point in space called the origin '''O''', in [[space]], to which is attached a [[coordinate system]]. A simple coordinate system might describe the position of a point '''P''' by means of an arrow designated as '''r''' (in classical mechanics called a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]]), pointing from the origin '''O''' to the point [[particle]]. In general, the point particle need not be stationary relative to '''O''', such that '''r''' is a function of ''t'', the [[time]]. In pre-Einstein relativity (known as [[Galilean relativity]]), time is considered an absolute, i.e., the [[time interval]] that is observed to elapse between any given pair of events is the same for all observers.<ref>{{cite book |title=Elements of Newtonian Mechanics |edition=illustrated |first1=Jens M. |last1=Knudsen |first2=Poul |last2=Hjorth |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |year=2012 |isbn=978-3-642-97599-8 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA30 Extract of page 30]</ref> In addition to relying on [[absolute time]], classical mechanics assumes [[Euclidean geometry]] for the structure of space.<ref>[http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-01-physics-i-fall-2003/lecture-notes/binder1.pdf MIT physics 8.01 lecture notes (page 12)] (PDF)</ref>\n\n====Velocity and speed====\n{{Main|Velocity|speed}}\nThe ''[[velocity]]'', or the [[calculus|rate of change]] of position with time, is defined as the [[derivative]] of the position with respect to time:\n:<math>\\mathbf{v} = {\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r} \\over \\mathrm{d}t}\\,\\!</math>.\n\nIn classical mechanics, velocities are directly additive and subtractive. For example, if one car traveling east at 60&nbsp;km/h passes another car traveling east at 50&nbsp;km/h, then from the perspective of the slower car, the faster car is traveling east at {{nowrap|60 \u2212 50 {{=}} 10 km/h}}. Whereas, from the perspective of the faster car, the slower car is moving 10&nbsp;km/h to the west. Velocities are directly additive as [[Wikibooks:Physics with Calculus/Mechanics/Scalar and Vector Quantities|vector quantities]]; they must be dealt with using [[vector analysis]].\n\nMathematically, if the velocity of the first object in the previous discussion is denoted by the vector {{nowrap|'''u''' {{=}} ''u'''''d'''}} and the velocity of the second object by the vector {{nowrap|'''v''' {{=}} ''v'''''e'''}}, where ''u'' is the speed of the first object, ''v'' is the speed of the second object, and '''d''' and '''e''' are [[unit vector]]s in the directions of motion of each particle respectively, then the velocity of the first object as seen by the second object is\n:<math>\\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{v} \\, .</math>\n\nSimilarly,\n:<math>\\mathbf{v'}= \\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{u} \\, .</math>\n\nWhen both objects are moving in the same direction, this equation can be simplified to\n:<math>\\mathbf{u}' = ( u - v ) \\mathbf{d} \\, .</math>\n\nOr, by ignoring direction, the difference can be given in terms of speed only:\n:<math>u' = u - v \\, .</math>\n\n====Acceleration====\n{{Main|Acceleration}}\nThe ''[[acceleration]]'', or rate of change of velocity, is the [[derivative]] of the velocity with respect to time (the [[derivative|second derivative]] of the position with respect to time):\n:<math>\\mathbf{a} = {\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} \\over \\mathrm{d}t} = {\\mathrm{d^2}\\mathbf{r} \\over \\mathrm{d}t^2}.</math>\n\nAcceleration represents the velocity's change over time: either of the velocity's magnitude or direction, or both. If only the magnitude ''v'' of the velocity decreases, this is sometimes referred to as ''deceleration'', but generally any change in the velocity with time, including deceleration, is simply referred to as acceleration.\n\n====Frames of reference====\n{{Main|Inertial frame of reference|Galilean transformation}}\nWhile the position, velocity and acceleration of a [[particle]] can be described with respect to any [[observer (special relativity)|observer]] in any state of motion, classical mechanics assumes the existence of a special family of [[frame of reference|reference frames]] in terms of which the mechanical laws of nature take a comparatively simple form. These special reference frames are called [[inertial frames]]. An inertial frame is one that when an object that has no force interactions (an idealized situation) is viewed from that frame, it appears either to be at rest or in a state of uniform motion in a straight line. This is the fundamental definition of an inertial frame. They are characterized by the requirement that all forces entering the observer's [[physical law]]s{{clarify|date=October 2013}} originate from identifiable sources caused by [[field (physics)|fields]], such as electro-static field (caused by static electrical charges), electro-magnetic field (caused by moving charges), gravitational field (caused by mass), and so forth. A non-inertial reference frame is one that is accelerating with respect to an inertial frame, and in such a non-inertial frame a particle appears to be acted on by other forces not explained by existing fields. Such other forces are called variously [[fictitious force]]s, inertia forces, pseudo-forces. Hence, there appears to be other forces that enter the equations of motion solely as a result of the observed accelerations. A key concept of inertial frames is the method for identifying them. For practical purposes, reference frames that are unaccelerated with respect to the [[star|distant stars]] (an extremely distant point) are regarded as good approximations to inertial frames.\n\nConsider two [[reference frames]] ''S'' and <var>S'</var>. For observers in each of the reference frames an event has space-time coordinates of (''x'',''y'',''z'',''t'') in frame ''S'' and (<var>x'</var>,<var>y'</var>,<var>z'</var>,<var>t'</var>) in frame <var>S'</var>. Assuming time is measured the same in all reference frames, and if we require {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} <var>x'</var>}} when {{nowrap|''t'' {{=}} 0}}, then the relation between the space-time coordinates of the same event observed from the reference frames <var>S'</var> and ''S'', which are moving at a relative velocity of ''u'' in the ''x'' direction is:\n:<var>x'</var> = ''x'' \u2212 ''u\u00b7t''\n:<var>y'</var> = ''y''\n:<var>z'</var> = ''z''\n:<var>t'</var> = ''t''.\n\nThis set of formulas defines a [[group transformation]] known as the [[Galilean transformation]] (informally, the ''Galilean transform''). This group is a limiting case of the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]] used in [[special relativity]]. The limiting case applies when the velocity ''u'' is very small compared to ''c'', the [[speed of light]].\n\nThe transformations have the following consequences:\n*'''v'''\u2032 = '''v''' \u2212 '''u''' (the velocity '''v'''\u2032 of a particle from the perspective of ''S''\u2032 is slower by '''u''' than its velocity '''v''' from the perspective of ''S'')\n*'''a'''\u2032 = '''a''' (the acceleration of a particle is the same in any inertial reference frame)\n*'''F'''\u2032 = '''F''' (the force on a particle is the same in any inertial reference frame)\n*the  [[speed of light]] is not a constant in classical mechanics, nor does the special position given to the speed of light in [[relativistic mechanics]] have a counterpart in classical mechanics.\n\nFor some problems, it is convenient to use rotating coordinates (reference frames). Thereby one can either keep a mapping to a convenient inertial frame, or introduce additionally a fictitious [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] and [[Coriolis force]].\n\n===Forces; Newton's second law===\n{{Main|Force|Newton's laws of motion}}\n[[Isaac Newton|Newton]] was the first to mathematically express the relationship between [[force]] and [[momentum]]. Some physicists interpret [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's second law|Newton's second law of motion]] as a definition of force and mass, while others consider it a fundamental postulate, a law of nature.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Either interpretation has the same mathematical consequences, historically known as \"Newton's Second Law\":\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = {\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{p} \\over \\mathrm{d}t} = {\\mathrm{d}(m \\mathbf{v}) \\over \\mathrm{d}t}.</math>\n\nThe quantity ''m'''''v''' is called the ([[canonical momentum|canonical]]) [[momentum]]. The net force on a particle is thus equal to the rate of change of the momentum of the particle with time. Since the definition of acceleration is {{nowrap|'''a''' {{=}} d'''v'''/d''t''}}, the second law can be written in the simplified and more familiar form:\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = m \\mathbf{a} \\, .</math>\n\nSo long as the force acting on a particle is known, Newton's second law is sufficient to describe the motion of a particle. Once independent relations for each force acting on a particle are available, they can be substituted into Newton's second law to obtain an [[ordinary differential equation]], which is called the ''equation of motion''.\n\nAs an example, assume that friction is the only force acting on the particle, and that it may be modeled as a function of the velocity of the particle, for example:\n:<math>\\mathbf{F}_{\\rm R} = - \\lambda \\mathbf{v} \\, ,</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03bb'' is a positive constant, the negative sign states that the force is opposite the sense of the velocity. Then the equation of motion is\n:<math>- \\lambda \\mathbf{v} = m \\mathbf{a} = m {\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v} \\over \\mathrm{d}t} \\, .</math>\n\nThis can be [[antiderivative|integrated]] to obtain\n:<math>\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v}_0 e^\\frac{-\\lambda t}{m}</math>\n\nwhere '''v'''<sub>0</sub> is the initial velocity. This means that the velocity of this particle [[exponential decay|decays exponentially]] to zero as time progresses. In this case, an equivalent viewpoint is that the kinetic energy of the particle is absorbed by friction (which converts it to heat energy in accordance with the [[conservation of energy]]), and the particle is slowing down. This expression can be further integrated to obtain the position '''r''' of the particle as a function of time.\n\nImportant forces include the [[gravity|gravitational force]] and the [[Lorentz force]] for [[electromagnetism]]. In addition, [[Newton's third law]] can sometimes be used to deduce the forces acting on a particle: if it is known that particle A exerts a force '''F''' on another particle B, it follows that B must exert an equal and opposite ''reaction force'', \u2212'''F''', on A. The strong form of Newton's third law requires that '''F''' and \u2212'''F''' act along the line connecting A and B, while the weak form does not. Illustrations of the weak form of Newton's third law are often found for magnetic forces.{{clarify|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Work and energy===\n{{Main|Work (physics)|kinetic energy|potential energy}}\nIf a constant force '''F''' is applied to a particle that makes a displacement \u0394'''r''',<ref group=\"note\">The displacement \u0394'''r''' is the difference of the particle's initial and final positions: \u0394'''r''' = '''r'''<sub>final</sub> \u2212 '''r'''<sub>initial</sub>.</ref> the ''work done'' by the force is defined as the [[scalar product]] of the force and displacement vectors:\n:<math>W = \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{r} \\, .</math>\n\nMore generally, if the force varies as a function of position as the particle moves from '''r'''<sub>1</sub> to '''r'''<sub>2</sub> along a path ''C'', the work done on the particle is given by the [[line integral]]\n:<math>W = \\int_C \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{r}) \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r} \\, .</math>\n\nIf the work done in moving the particle from '''r'''<sub>1</sub> to '''r'''<sub>2</sub> is the same no matter what path is taken, the force is said to be [[Conservative force|conservative]]. [[Gravity]] is a conservative force, as is the force due to an idealized [[Spring (device)|spring]], as given by [[Hooke's law]]. The force due to [[friction]] is non-conservative.\n\nThe [[kinetic energy]] ''E''<sub>k</sub> of a particle of mass ''m'' travelling at speed ''v'' is given by\n:<math>E_\\mathrm{k} = \\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2 \\, .</math>\n\nFor extended objects composed of many particles, the kinetic energy of the composite body is the sum of the kinetic energies of the particles.\n\nThe [[work\u2013energy theorem]] states that for a particle of constant mass ''m'', the total work ''W'' done on the particle as it moves from position '''r'''<sub>1</sub> to '''r'''<sub>2</sub> is equal to the change in [[kinetic energy]] ''E''<sub>k</sub> of the particle:\n:<math>W = \\Delta E_\\mathrm{k} = E_\\mathrm{k,2} - E_\\mathrm{k,1} = \\tfrac{1}{2}m\\left(v_2^{\\, 2} - v_1^{\\, 2}\\right) \\, .</math>\n\nConservative forces can be expressed as the [[gradient]] of a scalar function, known as the [[potential energy]] and denoted ''E''<sub>p</sub>:\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = - \\mathbf{\\nabla} E_\\mathrm{p} \\, .</math>\n\nIf all the forces acting on a particle are conservative, and ''E''<sub>p</sub> is the total potential energy (which is defined as a work of involved forces to rearrange mutual positions of bodies), obtained by summing the potential energies corresponding to each force\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{r} = - \\mathbf{\\nabla} E_\\mathrm{p} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{r} = - \\Delta E_\\mathrm{p} \\, .</math>\n \nThe decrease in the potential energy is equal to the increase in the kinetic energy\n:<math>-\\Delta E_\\mathrm{p} = \\Delta E_\\mathrm{k} \\Rightarrow \\Delta (E_\\mathrm{k} + E_\\mathrm{p}) = 0 \\, .</math>\n\nThis result is known as ''conservation of energy'' and states that the total [[energy]],\n:<math>\\sum E = E_\\mathrm{k} + E_\\mathrm{p} \\, ,</math>\n\nis constant in time. It is often useful, because many commonly encountered forces are conservative.\n\n===Beyond Newton's laws===\nClassical mechanics also describes the more complex motions of extended non-pointlike objects. [[Euler's laws]] provide extensions to Newton's laws in this area. The concepts of [[angular momentum]] rely on the same [[calculus]] used to describe one-dimensional motion. The [[rocket equation]] extends the notion of rate of change of an object's momentum to include the effects of an object \"losing mass\".\n\nThere are two important alternative formulations of classical mechanics: [[Lagrangian mechanics]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]. These, and other modern formulations, usually bypass the concept of \"force\", instead referring to other physical quantities, such as energy, speed and momentum, for describing mechanical systems in [[generalized coordinates]].\n\nThe expressions given above for momentum and kinetic energy are only valid when there is no significant electromagnetic contribution. In electromagnetism, Newton's second law for current-carrying wires breaks down unless one includes the electromagnetic field contribution to the momentum of the system as expressed by the [[Poynting vector]] divided by ''c''<sup>2</sup>, where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in free space.\n\n==Limits of validity==\n[[File:physicsdomains.svg|380px|thumb|alt=two by two chart of mechanics for size by speed|Domain of validity for Classical Mechanics]]\nMany branches of classical mechanics are simplifications or approximations of more accurate forms; two of the most accurate being [[general relativity]] and relativistic [[statistical mechanics]]. [[Geometric optics]] is an approximation to the [[Quantum optics|quantum theory of light]], and does not have a superior \"classical\" form.\n\nWhen both quantum mechanics and classical mechanics cannot apply, such as at the quantum level with many degrees of freedom, [[quantum field theory]] (QFT) is of use. QFT deals with small distances and large speeds with many degrees of freedom as well as the possibility of any change in the number of particles throughout the interaction. When treating large degrees of freedom at the macroscopic level, [[statistical mechanics]] becomes useful. Statistical mechanics describes the behavior of large (but countable) numbers of particles and their interactions as a whole at the macroscopic level. Statistical mechanics is mainly used in [[thermodynamics]] for systems that lie outside the bounds of the assumptions of classical thermodynamics. In the case of high [[velocity]] objects approaching the speed of light, classical mechanics is enhanced by [[special relativity]].  [[General relativity]] unifies special relativity with [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], allowing physicists to handle [[gravitation]] at a deeper level.\n\n===The Newtonian approximation to special relativity===\nIn special relativity, the momentum of a particle is given by\n:<math>\\mathbf{p} = \\frac{m \\mathbf{v}}{ \\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \\, ,</math>\nwhere ''m'' is the particle's rest mass, '''v''' its velocity, and ''c'' is the speed of light.\n\nIf ''v'' is very small compared to ''c'', ''v''<sup>2</sup>/''c''<sup>2</sup> is approximately zero, and so\n:<math>\\mathbf{p} \\approx m\\mathbf{v} \\, .</math>\nThus the Newtonian equation {{nowrap|'''p''' {{=}} ''m'''''v'''}} is an approximation of the relativistic equation for bodies moving with low speeds compared to the speed of light.\n\nFor example, the relativistic cyclotron frequency of a [[cyclotron]], [[gyrotron]], or high voltage [[magnetron]] is given by\n:<math>f = f_\\mathrm{c}\\frac{m_0}{m_0 + T/c^2} \\, ,</math>\nwhere ''f''<sub>c</sub> is the classical frequency of an electron (or other charged particle) with kinetic energy ''T'' and ([[Invariant mass|rest]]) mass ''m''<sub>0</sub> circling in a magnetic field. The (rest) mass of an electron is 511&nbsp;keV. So the frequency correction is 1% for a magnetic vacuum tube with a 5.11&nbsp;kV direct current accelerating voltage.\n\n===The classical approximation to quantum mechanics===\nThe ray approximation of classical mechanics breaks down when the [[de Broglie wavelength]] is not much smaller than other dimensions of the system. For non-relativistic particles, this wavelength is\n:<math>\\lambda=\\frac{h}{p}</math>\n\nwhere ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]] and ''p'' is the momentum.\n\nAgain, this happens with [[electrons]] before it happens with heavier particles. For example, the electrons used by [[Clinton Davisson]] and [[Lester Germer]] in 1927, accelerated by 54 volts, had a wavelength of 0.167&nbsp;nm, which was long enough to exhibit a single [[diffraction]] [[side lobe]] when reflecting from the face of a nickel [[crystal]] with atomic spacing of 0.215&nbsp;nm. With a larger [[vacuum chamber]], it would seem relatively easy to increase the [[angular resolution]] from around a radian to a milliradian and see quantum diffraction from the periodic patterns of [[integrated circuit]] computer memory.\n\nMore practical examples of the failure of classical mechanics on an engineering scale are conduction by [[quantum tunneling]] in [[tunnel diode]]s and very narrow [[transistor]] [[gate (transistor)|gates]] in [[integrated circuit]]s.\n\nClassical mechanics is the same extreme [[high frequency approximation]] as [[geometric optics]]. It is more often accurate because it describes particles and bodies with [[rest mass]]. These have more momentum and therefore shorter De Broglie wavelengths than massless particles, such as light, with the same kinetic energies.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of classical mechanics}}\n{{See also|Timeline of classical mechanics}}\nSome [[Greek philosophers]] of antiquity, among them [[Aristotle]], founder of [[Aristotelian physics]], may have been the first to maintain the idea that \"everything happens for a reason\" and that theoretical principles can assist in the understanding of nature. While to a modern reader, many of these preserved ideas come forth as eminently reasonable, there is a conspicuous lack of both mathematical [[theory]] and controlled [[experiment]], as we know it. These latter became decisive factors in forming modern science, and their early application came to be known as classical mechanics.\n\nIn his ''Elementa super demonstrationem ponderum'', medieval mathematician [[Jordanus de Nemore]] introduced the concept of \"positional [[gravity]]\" and the use of component [[forces]].<!--looks like Jagged misuse of sources: An early mathematical and experimental [[scientific method]] was introduced into [[Islamic science#Mechanics|mechanics]] in the 11th century by [[al-Biruni]], who along with [[al-Khazini]] in the 12th century, unified [[statics]] and [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]] into the [[science]] of mechanics, and combined the fields of [[hydrostatics]] with dynamics to create the field of [[hydrodynamics]].<ref>Mariam Rozhanskaya and I.

He concluded, based on [[Tycho Brahe]]'s observations of the orbit of [[Mars]], that the orbits were [[ellipse]]s. This break with [[Ancient philosophy|ancient thought]] was happening around the same time that [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] was proposing abstract mathematical laws for the motion of objects. He may (or may not) have performed the famous experiment of dropping two cannonballs of different weights from the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa|tower of Pisa]], showing that they both hit the ground at the same time. The reality of this experiment is disputed, but, more importantly, he did carry out quantitative experiments by rolling balls on an [[inclined plane]]. His theory of accelerated motion derived from the results of such experiments, and forms a cornerstone of classical mechanics.\n[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|240px|alt=portrait of Isaac Newton with long hair looking left|Sir [[Isaac Newton]] (1643\u20131727), an influential figure in the history of physics and whose [[Newton's laws of motion|three laws of motion]] form the basis of classical mechanics]]\nNewton founded his principles of natural philosophy on three proposed [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]]: the [[law of inertia]], his second law of acceleration (mentioned above), and the law of [[action and reaction]]; and hence laid the foundations for classical mechanics. Both Newton's second and third laws were given the proper scientific and mathematical treatment in Newton's ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', which distinguishes them from earlier attempts at explaining similar phenomena, which were either incomplete, incorrect, or given little accurate mathematical expression. Newton also enunciated the principles of [[conservation of momentum]] and [[angular momentum]]. In mechanics, Newton was also the first to provide the first correct<!--is this redundant?--> scientific and mathematical formulation of [[gravity]] in [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]]. The combination of Newton's laws of motion and gravitation provide the fullest and most accurate description of classical mechanics. He demonstrated that these laws apply to everyday objects as well as to celestial objects. In particular, he obtained a theoretical explanation of [[Kepler's laws]] of motion of the planets.\n\nNewton had previously invented the [[calculus]], of mathematics, and used it to perform the mathematical calculations. For acceptability, his book, the [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|''Principia'']], was formulated entirely in terms of the long-established geometric methods, which were soon eclipsed by his calculus. However, it was [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] who developed the notation of the [[derivative]] and [[integral]] preferred<ref>Jesseph, Douglas M. (1998). \"Leibniz on the Foundations of the Calculus: The Question of the Reality of Infinitesimal Magnitudes\". Perspectives on Science. 6.1&2: 6\u201340. Retrieved 31 December 2011.</ref> today.\n\n[[File:WilliamRowanHamilton.jpeg|left|thumb|180px|alt=photograph of William Rowan Hamilton in looking left|[[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]]'s greatest contribution is perhaps the reformulation of [[Newtonian mechanics]], now called [[Hamiltonian mechanics]].]]\nNewton, and most of his contemporaries, with the notable exception of [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]], worked on the assumption that classical mechanics would be able to explain all phenomena, including [[light]], in the form of [[geometric optics]]. Even when discovering the so-called [[Newton's rings]] (a [[wave interference]] phenomenon) he maintained his own [[corpuscular theory of light]].\n\nAfter Newton, classical mechanics became a principal field of study in mathematics as well as physics. Several re-formulations progressively allowed finding solutions to a far greater number of problems. The first notable re-formulation was in 1788 by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]]. Lagrangian mechanics was in turn re-formulated in 1833 by [[William Rowan Hamilton]].\n\nSome difficulties were discovered in the late 19th century that could only be resolved by more modern physics. Some of these difficulties related to compatibility with [[electromagnetic theory]], and the famous [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]]. The resolution of these problems led to the [[special theory of relativity]], often included in the term classical mechanics.\n\nA second set of difficulties were related to thermodynamics. When combined with [[thermodynamics]], classical mechanics leads to the [[Gibbs paradox]] of classical [[statistical mechanics]], in which [[entropy]] is not a well-defined quantity. [[Planck's law|Black-body radiation]] was not explained without the introduction of [[quantum|quanta]]. As experiments reached the atomic level, classical mechanics failed to explain, even approximately, such basic things as the [[energy levels]] and sizes of [[atoms]] and the [[photo-electric effect]]. The effort at resolving these problems led to the development of [[quantum mechanics]].\n\nSince the end of the 20th century, the place of classical mechanics in [[physics]] has been no longer that of an independent theory. Instead, classical mechanics is now considered an approximate theory to the more general quantum mechanics. Emphasis has shifted to understanding the fundamental forces of nature as in the [[Standard model]] and its more modern extensions into a unified [[theory of everything]].<ref>Page 2-10 of the ''[[Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'' says \"For already in classical mechanics there was indeterminability from a practical point of view.\" The past tense here implies that classical physics is no longer fundamental.</ref> Classical mechanics is a theory useful for the study of the motion of non-quantum mechanical, low-energy particles in weak gravitational fields. \nIn the 21st century classical mechanics has been extended into the [[complex domain]] and complex classical mechanics exhibits behaviors very similar to quantum mechanics.<ref>[http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0131 Complex Elliptic Pendulum], Carl M.
