They are areas of reduced surface temperature caused by concentrations of [[Magnetic flux|magnetic field flux]] that inhibit [[convection]]. Sunspots usually appear in pairs of opposite magnetic [[polarity (physics)|polarity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gsd/outreach/education/sam1/Activity10.html|title=Sunspots|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref> Their number varies according to the approximately 11-year [[#Period|solar cycle]].\n\nIndividual sunspots may endure anywhere from a few days to a few months, but eventually decay.

Most [[solar flares]] and [[coronal mass ejections]] originate in magnetically active regions around visible sunspot groupings. Similar phenomena indirectly observed on [[star]]s other than the sun are commonly called [[starspot]]s and both light and dark spots have been measured.<ref name=\"strassmeier\">{{cite web \n| title=Smallest KPNO Telescope Discovers Biggest Starspots (press release 990610)\n|url=http://www.aip.de/groups/activity/presse/pressrelease990610.html \n|first=K.

This is because the luminance (which is essentially \"brightness\" in visible light) of a heated [[black body]] (closely approximated by the photosphere) at these temperatures varies extremely with temperature\u2014considerably more so than the (temperature to the fourth power) variation in the total [[black-body radiation]] at all wavelengths (see [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law]]). Isolated from the surrounding photosphere a sunspot would be brighter than the [[Moon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/workbook/sunspot.html|title=Sunspots|publisher=NASA|date=1 April 1998|accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nSunspots have two parts: the central [[wikt:umbra|umbra]], which is the darkest part, where the magnetic field is approximately vertical ([[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the Sun's surface) and the surrounding [[wikt:penumbra|penumbra]], which is lighter, where the magnetic field is more inclined.\n\n=== Lifecycle ===\n\nAlthough the details of sunspot generation are still a matter of research, it appears that sunspots are the visible counterparts of [[magnetic flux tube]]s in the Sun's [[Convection zone|convective zone]] that get \"wound up\" by [[differential rotation]]. If the stress on the tubes reaches a certain limit, they curl up and puncture the Sun's surface. Convection is inhibited at the puncture points; the energy flux from the Sun's interior decreases; and with it surface temperature.\n\nThe [[Wilson effect]] implies that sunspots are depressions on the Sun's surface. Observations using the [[Zeeman effect]] show that prototypical sunspots come in pairs with opposite magnetic polarity. From cycle to cycle, the polarities of leading and trailing (with respect to the solar rotation) sunspots change from north/south to south/north and back. Sunspots usually appear in groups.\n\n[[Magnetic pressure]] should tend to remove field concentrations, causing the sunspots to disperse, but sunspot lifetimes are measured in days to weeks. In 2001, observations from the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO) using sound waves traveling below the photosphere (local [[helioseismology]]) were used to develop a three-dimensional image of the internal structure below sunspots; these observations show that a powerful downdraft underneath each sunspot, forms a rotating [[vortex]] that sustains the concentrated magnetic field.<ref>{{cite news|title=SOHO reveals how sunspots take stranglehold on the Sun|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n0111/06sunspots/|newspaper=SpaceFlight Now|date=6 November 2001|author=NASA News Release}}</ref>\n\n=== Period ===\n{{main|Solar cycle}}\n[[Image:Sunspot butterfly graph.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|Butterfly diagram showing paired [[Sp\u00f6rer's law]] behavior|alt=Point chart showing sunspot area as percent of the total area at various latitudes, above grouped bar chart showing average daily sunspot area as % of visible hemisphere.]]\n\nSunspot activity cycles about every eleven years. The point of highest sunspot activity during a cycle is known as solar maximum, and the point of lowest activity as solar minimum.  This period is also observed in most other [[Solar phenomena|solar activity]] and is linked to a variation in the solar magnetic field that changes polarity with this period.\n\nEarly in the cycle, sunspots appear in the higher latitudes and then move towards the equator as the cycle approaches maximum, following [[Sp\u00f6rer's law]]. Spots from two adjacent cycles can co-exist for some time. Spots from adjacent cycles can be distinguished by direction of their magnetic field.\n\n[[Wolf number|The Wolf number]] sunspot index counts the average number of sunspots during specific intervals. The 11-year solar cycles are numbered sequentially, starting with the observations made in the 1750s.<ref name=\"testtest1\">{{cite book\n| author=Tribble, A.  |date=2003\n| title=The Space Environment, Implications for Spacecraft Design\n| publisher=Princeton University Press | pages=15\u201318}}</ref>\n\n[[George Ellery Hale]] first linked magnetic fields and sunspots in 1908.<ref name=\"doi10.1086/141602\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Hale | first1 = G.

[[Horace W. Babcock]] later proposed a qualitative model for the dynamics of the solar outer layers. The [[Babcock Model]] explains that magnetic fields cause the behavior described by Sp\u00f6rer's law, as well as other effects, which are twisted by the Sun's rotation.\n\n=== Solar cycle ===\n{{main|Solar cycle}}\n\nSunspot populations rise quickly and fall more slowly on an irregular [[Solar cycle|cycle of 11&nbsp;years]].  Their numbers also change on over long periods. For example, from 1900 to the 1960s, the [[solar maxima]] trend of sunspot count was upwards; for the following decades it diminished.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sidc.oma.be/html/wolfaml.html |title=Sunspot index graphics |publisher=Solar Influences Data Analysis Center |accessdate=27 September 2007}}</ref> However, the Sun was last as active as this period over 8,000 years ago.<ref name=\"pmid15510145\">{{cite journal\n| display-authors=4\n| author=Solanki SK\n| author2=Usoskin IG\n| author3=Kromer B\n| author4=Sch\u00fcssler M\n| author5=Beer J |date=October 2004\n| title=Unusual activity of the Sun during recent decades compared to the previous 11,000 years\n| journal=Nature |volume=431 |issue=7012 |pages=1084\u20131087\n| url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/pubs/solanki2004/solanki2004.html\n| doi=10.1038/nature02995 |pmid=15510145 |bibcode=2004Natur.431.1084S\n}}</ref>\n\nThe number of sunspots correlates with the intensity of [[solar radiation]] over the period since 1979, when satellite measurements became available.

These telescopes use filtration and projection techniques for direct observation, in addition to various types of filtered cameras. Specialized tools such as [[spectroscope]]s and [[spectrohelioscope]]s are used to examine sunspots and sunspot areas. Artificial eclipses allow viewing of the circumference of the Sun as sunspots rotate through the horizon.\n\nSince looking directly at the Sun with the naked eye permanently damages human vision, amateur observation of sunspots is generally conducted using projected images, or directly through protective filters. Small sections of very dark [[optical filter|filter glass]], such as a #14 welder's glass, are effective. A telescope eyepiece can project the image, without filtration, onto a white screen where it can be viewed indirectly, and even traced, to follow sunspot evolution. Special purpose [[H-alpha#Filter|hydrogen-alpha]] narrow bandpass filters as well as [[vacuum deposition|aluminum coated]] glass attenuation filters (which have the appearance of mirrors due to their extremely high [[optical density]]) on the front of a telescope provide safe observation through the eyepiece.\n\n== Application ==\n\nDue to its link to other kinds of [[solar variation|solar activity]], sunspot occurrence can be used to help predict [[space weather]], the state of the [[ionosphere]], and hence the conditions of [[short-wave]] [[radio propagation]] or [[satellite communication]]s. [[Solar activity and climate|Solar activity]] (and the solar cycle) have been implicated in [[global warming]], originally the role of the [[Maunder Minimum]] of sunspot occurrence in the [[Little Ice Age]] in European winter climate.<ref name=\"MM_PAPER\">{{cite journal |author=Eddy J.A. |title=The Maunder Minimum |journal=Science |volume=192 |issue=4245 |pages=1189\u20131202 |date=June 1976 |pmid=17771739 |doi= 10.1126/science.192.4245.1189|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/citation/192/4245/1189|bibcode = 1976Sci...192.1189E }} [http://bill.srnr.arizona.edu/classes/182h/Climate/Solar/Maunder%20Minimum.pdf PDF Copy]</ref> Sunspots themselves, in terms of the magnitude of their radiant-energy deficit, have a weak effect on terrestrial climate<ref>{{Cite web\n| author=Hudson H |date=2008 \n| title=Solar activity |publisher=Scholarpedia \n| url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Solar_activity |accessdate=2011-01-27\n}}</ref> in a direct sense.
