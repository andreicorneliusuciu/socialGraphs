On the left, the spring is connected to the frame through a shackle.]]\nA '''leaf spring''' is a simple form of [[spring (device)|spring]] commonly used for the [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] in [[wheel]]ed [[vehicle]]s.  Originally called a ''laminated'' or ''carriage spring'', and sometimes referred to as a '''semi-[[ellipse|elliptical]] spring''' or '''cart spring''', it is one of the oldest forms of springing, dating back to [[Middle Ages|medieval]] times.\n\n[[File:1928AlvisModelFD1275-FrontSuspension.jpg|thumb|Leaf springs front independent suspension, front-wheel-drive [[Alvis Car and Engineering Company Ltd|Alvis]] 1928]]\n[[File:Humber front suspension (Autocar Handbook, 13th ed, 1935).jpg|thumb|Independent front suspension by transverse leaf spring [[Humber Limited|Humber]] 1935]]\n[[Image:MBW153chassis.jpg|thumb|Independent front suspension by semi-elliptical springs Mercedes Benz 230 W153 1938]]\n[[Image:Leaf spring on a train.jpg|thumb|Leaf spring on a German locomotive built by Orenstein-Koppel and L\u00fcbecker Maschinenbau]]\nA leaf spring takes the form of a slender [[Arc (geometry)|arc]]-shaped length of [[spring steel]] of [[rectangle|rectangular]] cross-section.  In the most common configuration, the center of the arc provides location for the [[axle]], while [[tie holes]] are provided at either end for attaching to the vehicle body.  For very heavy vehicles, a leaf spring can be made from several leaves stacked on top of each other in several layers, often with progressively shorter leaves. Leaf springs can serve locating and to some extent damping as well as springing functions. While the interleaf friction provides a damping action, it is not well controlled and results in [[stiction]] in the motion of the suspension.  For this reason some manufacturers have used mono-leaf springs.\n\nA leaf spring can either be attached directly to the [[Frame (vehicle)|frame]] at both ends or attached directly at one end, usually the front, with the other end attached through a shackle, a short swinging arm. The shackle takes up the tendency of the leaf spring to elongate when compressed and thus makes for softer springiness. Some springs terminated in a concave end, called a ''spoon end'' (seldom used now), to carry a swivelling member.\n\n==History==\nThere were a variety of leaf springs, usually employing the word \"elliptical\". \"Elliptical\" or \"full elliptical\" leaf springs referred to two circular arcs linked at their tips. This was joined to the frame at the top center of the upper arc, the bottom center was joined to the \"live\" suspension components, such as a solid front axle. Additional suspension components, such as [[trailing arm]]s, would usually be needed for this design, but not for \"semi-elliptical\" leaf springs as used in the [[Hotchkiss drive]]. That employed the lower arc, hence its name. \"Quarter-elliptic\" springs often had the thickest part of the stack of leaves stuck into the rear end of the side pieces of a short ladder frame, with the free end attached to the differential, as in the [[Austin 7|Austin Seven]] of the 1920s. As an example of non-elliptic leaf springs, the [[Ford Model T]] had multiple leaf springs over its differential that were curved in the shape of a [[yoke]]. As a substitute for dampers ([[shock absorber]]s), some manufacturers laid non-metallic sheets in between the metal leaves, such as wood.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Elliptic || [[File:Spring 3 (PSF).png|200px|alt=Carriage with elliptic springs]]\n|-\n| {{visible anchor|Semi-elliptic}}{{anchor|Half-elliptic}} || [[File:Semi elliptic spring and mounting (Manual of Driving and Maintenance).jpg|200px|alt=Vehicle suspension with semi-elliptic springs]]\n|-\n| {{visible anchor|Three quarter-elliptic}} || [[File:Back axle suspension springs.jpg|200px|alt=Car suspension with three-quarter elliptic springs]]\n|-\n| {{visible anchor|Quarter-elliptic}} || [[File:Quarter elliptic spring mounting (Manual of Driving and Maintenance).jpg|200px|alt=Vehicle suspension with quarter-elliptic springs]]\n|-\n| Transverse || [[File:Transverse leaf spring (Manual of Driving and Maintenance).jpg|200px|alt=Front suspension with transverse leaf spring]]\n|}\n\nLeaf springs were very common on [[automobiles]], right up to the 1970s in Europe and Japan and late 1970s in America when the move to [[front-wheel drive]], and more sophisticated [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] designs saw [[automobile manufacturer]]s use [[spring (device)|coil springs]] instead. Today leaf springs are still used in heavy commercial vehicles such as [[van]]s and [[truck]]s, [[SUV]]s, and [[railway carriage]]s. For heavy vehicles, they have the advantage of spreading the load more widely over the vehicle's chassis, whereas coil springs transfer it to a single point. Unlike coil springs, leaf springs also locate the rear axle, eliminating the need for [[trailing arm]]s and a [[Panhard rod]], thereby saving cost and weight in a simple [[live axle]] rear suspension. A further advantage of a leaf spring over a helical spring is that the end of the leaf spring may be guided along a definite path.\n\nA more modern implementation is the parabolic leaf spring. This design is characterised by fewer leaves whose thickness varies from centre to ends following a [[parabola|parabolic curve]]. In this design, inter-leaf friction is unwanted, and therefore there is only contact between the springs at the ends and at the centre where the axle is connected. Spacers prevent contact at other points. Aside from a weight saving, the main advantage of parabolic springs is their greater flexibility, which translates into vehicle [[ride quality]] that approaches that of coil springs.  There is a trade-off in the form of reduced load carrying capability, however. The characteristic of parabolic springs is better riding comfort and not as \"stiff\" as conventional \"multi-leaf springs\". It is widely used on [[buses]] for better comfort. A further development by the British GKN company and by Chevrolet with the Corvette amongst others, is the move to composite plastic leaf springs. Nevertheless, due to missing inter-leaf friction and internal dampening effects this type of springs requires more powerful dampers or shock absorbers.\n\nTypically when used in automobile suspension the leaf both supports an axle and locates/ partially locates the axle. This can lead to handling issues (such as 'axle tramp'), as the flexible nature of the spring makes precise control of the [[unsprung mass]] of the axle difficult. Some suspension designs use a Watts link (or a Panhard rod) and radius arms to locate the axle and do not have this drawback. Such designs can use softer springs, resulting in better ride. The various Austin-Healey 3000's and [[Fiat 128]]'s rear suspension are examples.\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe leaf spring acts as a linkage for holding the axle in position and thus separate linkages are not necessary.\nIt makes the construction of the suspension simple and strong.\n\nBecause the positioning of the axle is carried out by the leaf springs, it is disadvantageous to use soft springs\ni.e. springs with low spring constant.\n\nTherefore, this type of suspension does not provide good riding comfort.\nThe inter-leaf friction between the leaf springs affects the riding comfort.\n\nAcceleration and braking torque cause wind-up and vibration. Also wind-up causes rear-end squat and nose-diving.\n\nThe inter-leaf friction damps the spring's motion and reduces rebound, which until [[shock absorber]]s were widely adopted was a great advantage over helical springs.<ref>\"Springs - A simple study of car suspension\", ''The Automotor Journal'', August 10, 1912, pp936-937</ref>\n\n==Manufacturing process==\nMulti-leaf springs are made as follows:\n\n# Shearing of flat bar\n# Center hole punching / Drilling\n# End Heating process forming (hot & cold process)\n## Eye Forming / Wrapper Forming\n## Diamond cutting / end trimming / width cutting / end tapering\n## End punching / end grooving / end bending / end forging / eye grinding / end rolling\n## Center hole punching / Drilling / nibbing\n# Heat Treatment\n## Heating\n## Hardening\n## Cambering\n## Quenching\n## Tempering\n# Surface preparation\n## Shot peening / stress peening\n## Primary painting\n# Eye bush preparation process\n## Eye reaming / eye boring\n## Bush insertion\n## Bush reaming\n# Assemble\n## Presetting & load testing\n## Finish painting\n## Marking & packing\n\n==Other uses==\n===By blacksmiths===\n\nBecause leaf springs are made of relatively high quality steel, they are a favorite material for [[blacksmiths]].
