The [[User (computing)|user]] [[credential]]s are typically some form of \"username\" and a matching \"password\",<ref name=\"LINFO\" /> and these credentials themselves are sometimes referred to as  '''a login''', (or '''a logon''' or '''a sign in''' or '''a sign on''').<ref name=\"Oxford dictionary\">[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/login Oxford Dictionaries], definition of ''login''.</ref><ref name=\"LINFO\">[http://www.linfo.org/login_def.html The Linux Information Project], detail and definition of ''login'' and ''logging in''.</ref> In practice, modern secure systems also often require a [[2FA| second factor]] for extra security. \n\nWhen access is no longer needed, the user can '''log out''' ('''log off''', '''sign out''' or '''sign off'''). \n\n==Procedure==\n[[File:Finger Print Login latest banking security application.png|thumb|left|Finger print login, a recent banking security application.]]\nLogging in is usually used to enter a specific page, which trespassers cannot see. Once the user is logged in, the login token may be used to track what actions the user has taken while connected to the site. Logging out may be performed explicitly by the [[User (computing)|user]] taking some actions, such as entering the appropriate [[Command (computing)|command]], or clicking a [[website]] link labelled as such. It can also be done implicitly, such as by the user powering off his or her workstation, closing a [[web browser]] window, leaving a website, or not refreshing a webpage within a defined period.\n\nIn the case of web sites that use [[HTTP cookie|cookies]] to track sessions, when the user logs out, session-only cookies from that site will usually be deleted from the user's computer. In addition, the server invalidates any associations with the session, making any session-handle in the user's cookie store useless. This feature comes in handy if the user is using a [[public computer]] or a computer that is using a [[Hot spot (Wi-Fi)|public wireless connection]]. As a security precaution, one should not rely on implicit means of logging out of a system, especially not on a public computer, instead one should explicitly log out and wait for the confirmation that this request has taken place.\n\nLogging out of a computer when leaving it is a common security practice, preventing unauthorized users from tampering with it. There are also people who choose to have a password-protected [[screensaver]] set to activate after some period of inactivity, requiring the user to re-enter his or her login credentials to unlock the screensaver and gain access to the system. There can be different methods of logging in that may be via image, fingerprints, eye scan, password (oral or textual input), etc.\n\n==History and etymology==\nThe terms became common with the [[time sharing]] systems of the 1960s and [[Bulletin Board System]]s (BBS) in the 1970s. Early [[home computers]] and [[personal computer]]s did not generally require them until [[Windows NT]], [[OS/2]] and [[Linux]] in the 1990s.\n\nThe noun ''login'' comes from the verb ''(to) log in'', and by analogy with the verb ''to clock in''. Computer systems keep a ''[[logbook|log]]'' of users' access to the system. The term \"log\" comes from the [[chip log]] historically used to record distance travelled at sea, and recorded in a [[ship's log]] or [[logbook|log book]]. To ''sign in'' connotes the same idea, but based on the analogy of manually signing a log or [[guestbook|visitors book]].  \n\nWhile there is no agreed difference in meaning between the three terms (''login'', ''logon'' and ''sign in''), different technical communities tend to prefer one or another - Unix, Novell, Linux and Apple typically using ''login'', with Apple's [[style guide]] saying ''\"Users log in to a file server (not log on to)...\"'',<ref>[https://help.apple.com/asg/mac/2013/ASG_2013.pdf \"Apple Style Guide\"], April 2013, apple.com</ref> By contrast, Microsoft's style guides traditionally suggested the opposite, and prescribed ''log on'' and ''logon''.<ref name=ms/> In the past Microsoft reserved ''sign in'' to when accessing the Internet<ref name=ms>\"Use log on or log on to... Do not use log in, login\", 2004, ''Manual of Style for Technical Publications'', 3rd edition, page 295, Microsoft.com</ref> but from [[Windows 8]] onwards, have moved to the ''sign in'' terminology for local authentication.<ref>[http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/sign-in-out-of-windows \"Sign in to or out of Windows\"], Microsoft.com</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary|login}}\n{{Wiktionary|log in}}\n{{Commons category|Login screens}}\n\n* [[User (computing)|Account]]\n* [[Computer security]]\n* [[Login session]]\n* [[Login spoofing]]\n* [[OpenID]]\n* [[Password]]\n* [[Password policy]]\n* [[Personal identification number]]\n* [[utmp|/var/log/wtmp]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Authentication methods]]\n[[Category:User interfaces]]\n[[Category:Computer access control]]"}]}}}}
