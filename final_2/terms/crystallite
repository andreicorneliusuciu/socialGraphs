The  orientation of crystallites can be random with no preferred direction, called random texture, or directed, possibly due to growth and processing conditions. [[Texture (crystalline)#Thin film textures|Fiber texture]] is an example of the latter. Crystallites are also referred to as '''grains'''. The areas where crystallite grains meet are known as [[grain boundaries]]. Polycrystalline or multicrystalline materials, or polycrystals are solids that are composed of many crystallites of varying size and orientation. \n\nMost inorganic solids are polycrystalline, including all common [[metal]]s, many [[ceramic]]s, rocks and ice. The extent to which a solid is crystalline ([[crystallinity]]) has important effects on its physical properties.<ref>Purdue University [http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/ch13/category.php Categories of Solids]</ref> [[Sulfur]], while usually polycrystalline, may also occur in other [[allotropic]] forms with completely different properties.<ref>C.Michael Hogan. 2011.

Polycrystalline structures and [[paracrystalline]] phases are in between these two extremes.\n\n== Details ==\n\n[[File:Crystalline_polycrystalline_amorphous.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|Different degrees of ordered structures: a [[monocrystalline]] crystal, polycrystalline structure, and [[amorphous solid|amorphous]] or non-crystalline solid.]]\n\nCrystal size is usually measured from X-ray diffraction patterns and grain size by other experimental techniques like transmission electron microscopy. Solid objects that are large enough to see and handle are rarely composed of a [[single crystal]], except for a few cases ([[gemstone|gems]], [[Monocrystalline silicon|silicon single crystals]] for the electronics industry, certain types of [[fiber]], single crystals of a [[nickel]]-based superalloy for [[turbojet]] engines, and some ice crystals which can exceed 0.5 meters in diameter).<ref>{{cite journal|authors=J.

The crystallite size can vary from a few nanometers to several millimeters.\n\n[[Image:Bronze_bell_with_visible_material_structure.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Bronze]] bell with large crystallites on the inside.]]\n\nIf the individual crystallites are oriented completely at random, a large enough volume of polycrystalline material will be approximately [[isotropic]]. This property helps the simplifying assumptions of [[continuum mechanics]] to apply to real-world solids. However, most manufactured materials have some alignment to their crystallites, resulting in ''[[texture (crystalline)|texture]]'' that must be taken into account for accurate predictions of their behavior and characteristics. When the crystallites are mostly ordered with just some random spread of orientations, one has a [[mosaic crystal]].\n\nMaterial [[fracture]]s can be [[intergranular fracture]] or a [[transgranular fracture]]. There is an ambiguity with powder grains: a powder grain can be made of several crystallites. Thus, the (powder) \"grain size\"  found by laser granulometry can be different from the \"grain size\" (or, rather, crystallite size) found by [[X-ray crystallography|X-ray diffraction]] (e.g. [[Scherrer equation|Scherrer]] method), by [[Microscopy|optical microscopy]] under polarised light, or by [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]] (backscattered electrons).\n\nCoarse grained rocks are formed very slowly, while fine grained rocks are formed quickly, on geological time scales. If a rock forms very quickly, such as the solidification of [[lava]] ejected from a [[volcano]], there may be no crystals at all. This is how [[obsidian]] forms.\n\n== Grain boundaries ==\n\n{{Contradicts other|date=October 2008|1=Grain boundary}}\n\n{{main|Grain boundary}}\n\nGrain boundaries are interfaces where crystals of different orientations meet. A grain boundary is a single-phase interface, with crystals on each side of the boundary being identical except in orientation. The term \"crystallite boundary\" is sometimes, though rarely, used. Grain boundary areas contain those atoms that have been perturbed from their original lattice sites, [[dislocations]], and impurities that have migrated to the lower energy grain boundary.\n\nTreating a grain boundary geometrically as an interface of a single crystal cut into two parts, one of which is rotated, we see that there are five variables required to define a grain boundary. The first two numbers come from the unit vector that specifies a rotation axis. The third number designates the angle of rotation of the grain. The final two numbers specify the plane of the grain boundary (or a unit vector that is normal to this plane).\n\nGrain boundaries disrupt the motion of dislocations through a material. Dislocation propagation is impeded because of the stress field of the grain boundary defect region and the lack of slip planes and slip directions and overall alignment across the boundaries. Reducing grain size is therefore a common way to improve [[strength of materials|strength]], often without any sacrifice in [[toughness]] because the smaller grains create more obstacles per unit area of slip plane. This crystallite size-strength relationship is given by the [[Grain boundary strengthening|Hall-Petch relationship]]. The high [[surface energy|interfacial energy]] and relatively weak bonding in grain boundaries makes them preferred sites for the onset of [[corrosion]] and for the [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of new phases from the solid.\n\nGrain boundary migration plays an important role in many of the mechanisms of [[Creep (deformation)|creep]]. Grain boundary migration occurs when a shear stress acts on the grain boundary plane and causes the grains to slide. This means that fine-grained materials actually have a poor resistance to creep relative to coarser grains, especially at high temperatures, because smaller grains contain more atoms in grain boundary sites. Grain boundaries also cause deformation in that they are sources and sinks of point defects. Voids in a material tend to gather in a grain boundary, and if this happens to a critical extent, the material could [[fracture]].\n\nDuring grain boundary migration, the rate determining step depends on the angle between two adjacent grains. In a small angle dislocation boundary, the migration rate depends on vacancy diffusion between dislocations. In a high angle dislocation boundary, this depends on the atom transport by single atom jumps from the shrinking to the growing grains.<ref>R.D. Doherty et al., ''[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TXD-3S72M8R-1&_user=499885&_handle=V-WA-A-W-WA-MsSAYVA-UUW-U-AAVDWWZDBU-AAVVYUDCBU-DYYUUAVUV-WA-U&_fmt=summary&_coverDate=11%2F15%2F1997&_rdoc=1&_orig=browse&_srch=%23toc%235588%231997%23997619997%236130!&_cdi=5588&view=c&_acct=C000024500&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=499885&md5=908908c9ec3f6083c310018ef34b1832 Current issues in recrystallization: a review]'', Materials Science and Engineering A238 (1997), p. 222 ''(Access to the article for subscribers only)''</ref>\n\nGrain boundaries are generally only a few nanometers wide.  In common materials, crystallites are large enough that grain boundaries account for a small fraction of the material.  However, very small grain sizes are achievable.  In nanocrystalline solids, grain boundaries become a significant volume fraction of the material, with profound effects on such properties as [[diffusion]] and [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]].  In the limit of small crystallites, as the volume fraction of grain boundaries approaches 100%, the material ceases to have any crystalline character, and thus becomes an [[amorphous solid]].\n\nGrain boundaries are also present in [[magnetic domains]] in magnetic materials. A computer hard disk, for example, is made of a hard [[ferromagnetic]] material that contains regions of atoms whose magnetic moments can be realigned by an inductive head. The magnetization varies from region to region, and the misalignment between these regions forms boundaries that are key to data storage. The inductive head measures the orientation of the magnetic moments of these domain regions and reads out either a \u201c1\u201d or \u201c0\u201d. These [[bit]]s are the data being read. Grain size is important in this technology because it limits the number of bits that can fit on one hard disk. The smaller the grain sizes, the more data that can be stored.\n\nBecause of the dangers of grain boundaries in certain materials such as [[superalloy]] turbine blades, great technological leaps were made to minimize as much as possible the effect of grain boundaries in the blades. The result was [[directional solidification]] processing in which grain boundaries were eliminated by producing columnar grain structures aligned parallel to the axis of the blade, since this is usually the direction of maximum tensile stress felt by a blade during its rotation in an airplane. The resulting turbine blades consisted of a single grain, improving reliability.\n\nGenerally, polycrystals cannot be [[superheating|superheated]]; they will melt promptly once they are brought to a high enough temperature.  This is because grain boundaries are amorphous, and serve as [[Nucleation|nucleation points]] for the liquid [[phase (matter)|phase]].  By contrast, if no solid nucleus is present as a liquid cools, it tends to become [[supercooling|supercooled]].  Since this is undesirable for mechanical materials, [[alloy]] designers often take steps against it.
