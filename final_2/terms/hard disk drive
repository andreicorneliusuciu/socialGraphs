Capacity is specified in [[unit prefix]]es corresponding to powers of {{Not a typo|1000}}: a 1-[[terabyte]] (TB) drive has a capacity of {{Not a typo|1,000}} [[gigabyte]]s (GB; where 1 gigabyte = {{Not a typo|1 billion}} [[byte]]s). Typically, some of an HDD's capacity is unavailable to the user because it is used by the [[file system]] and the computer [[operating system]], and possibly inbuilt redundancy for [[error correction]] and recovery. Performance is specified by the time required to move the heads to a track or cylinder (average access time) plus the time it takes for the desired sector to move under the head (average [[Latency (engineering)|latency]], which is a function of the physical [[rotational speed]] in [[revolutions per minute]]), and finally the speed at which the data is transmitted (data rate).\n\nThe two most common [[form factor]]s for modern HDDs are 3.5-[[inch]], for desktop computers, and 2.5-inch, primarily for laptops. HDDs are connected to systems by standard [[computer interface|interface]] cables such as [[Parallel ATA|PATA]] (Parallel ATA), [[SATA]] (Serial ATA), [[USB]] or SAS ([[Serial attached SCSI]]) cables.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:HardDisk1.ogg|thumb|right|Video of modern HDD operation (cover removed)]]\n{{Main article|history of hard disk drives}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"max-width: 35em;\"\n|+ Improvement of HDD characteristics over time\n|-\n!

Cylinder-mode read/write operations were supported, while the heads flew about 250 micro-inches above the platter surface.  Motion of the head array depended upon a binary adder system of hydraulic actuators which assured repeatable positioning.  The 1301 cabinet was about the size of three home refrigerators placed side by side, storing the equivalent of about 21 million eight-bit bytes.  Access time was about 200 milliseconds.\n\nIn 1962, IBM introduced the [[IBM 1311|model 1311]] disk drive, which was about the size of a washing machine and stored two million characters on a removable [[disk pack]]. Users could buy additional packs and interchange them as needed, much like reels of [[magnetic tape]]. Later models of removable pack drives, from IBM and others, became the norm in most computer installations and reached capacities of 300 megabytes by the early 1980s. Non-removable HDDs were called \"fixed disk\" drives.\n\nSome high-performance HDDs were manufactured with one head per track (e.g. [[IBM&nbsp;2305]]) so that no time was lost physically moving the heads to a track.<ref>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Resource Guide 1995, Chapter 17 \u2013 Disk and File System Basics</ref> Known as fixed-head or head-per-track disk drives they were very expensive and are no longer in production.<ref>Computer Organization and Design, 2nd Ed., P. Pal Chaudhuri, 2006, p. 635</ref>\n\nIn 1973, IBM introduced a new type of HDD codenamed [[IBM 3340|\"Winchester\"]]. Its primary distinguishing feature was that the disk heads were not withdrawn completely from the stack of disk platters when the drive was powered down. Instead, the heads were allowed to \"land\" on a special area of the disk surface upon spin-down, \"taking off\" again when the disk was later powered on. This greatly reduced the cost of the head actuator mechanism, but precluded removing just the disks from the drive as was done with the disk packs of the day. Instead, the first models of \"Winchester technology\" drives featured a removable disk module, which included both the disk pack and the head assembly, leaving the actuator motor in the drive upon removal. Later \"Winchester\" drives abandoned the removable media concept and returned to non-removable platters.\n\nLike the first removable pack drive, the first \"Winchester\" drives used platters {{convert|14|in}} in diameter. A few years later, designers were exploring the possibility that physically smaller platters might offer advantages. Drives with non-removable eight-inch platters appeared, and then drives that used a {{convert|5+1/4|in|abbr=on}} [[#Form factors|form factor]] (a mounting width equivalent to that used by contemporary [[floppy disk drive]]s). The latter were primarily intended for the then-fledgling personal computer (PC) market.\n\nAs the 1980s began, HDDs were a rare and very expensive additional feature in PCs, but by the late 1980s their cost had been reduced to the point where they were standard on all but the cheapest computers.\n\nMost HDDs in the early 1980s, were sold to PC end users as an external, add-on subsystem. The subsystem was not sold under the drive manufacturer's name but under the subsystem manufacturer's name such as [[Corvus Systems]] and [[Tallgrass Technologies]], or under the PC system manufacturer's name such as the [[Apple ProFile]]. The [[IBM PC/XT]] in 1983 included an internal 10&nbsp;MB HDD, and soon thereafter internal HDDs proliferated on personal computers.\n\nExternal HDDs remained popular for much longer on the [[Apple Macintosh]]. Many Macintosh computers made between 1986 and 1998 featured a [[SCSI]] port on the back, making external expansion simple. Older compact Macintosh computers did not have user-accessible hard drive bays (indeed, the [[Macintosh 128K]], [[Macintosh 512K]], and [[Macintosh Plus]] did not feature a hard drive bay at all), so on those models external SCSI disks were the only reasonable option for expanding upon any internal storage.\n\nThe [[2011&nbsp;Thailand floods]] damaged the manufacturing plants and impacted hard disk drive cost adversely between 2011 and 2013.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://blog.backblaze.com/2012/10/09/backblaze_drive_farming/\n | title = Farming hard drives: how Backblaze weathered the Thailand drive crisis\n | year = 2013 | accessdate = 2014-05-23\n | website = blaze.com\n}}</ref>\n\nDriven by ever increasing [[memory storage density|areal density]] since their invention, HDDs have continuously improved their characteristics; a few highlights are listed in the table above. At the same time, market application expanded from [[mainframe computer]]s of the late 1950s to most [[mass storage]] applications including computers and consumer applications such as storage of entertainment content.\n\n== Technology ==\n[[File:magneticMedia.svg|thumb|Magnetic cross section & [[frequency modulation]] encoded binary data]]\n\n=== Magnetic recording ===\n{{See also|magnetic storage}}\n\nA modern HDD records data by magnetizing a thin film of [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] material{{Efn|Initially gamma iron oxide particles in an epoxy binder, the recording layer in a modern HDD typically is domains of a granular Cobalt-Chrome-Platinum-based alloy physically isolated by an oxide to enable [[perpendicular recording]].<ref>[http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1201/1201.5543.pdf New Paradigms in Magnetic Recording]</ref>}} on a disk. Sequential changes in the direction of magnetization represent binary data [[bit]]s. The data is read from the disk by detecting the transitions in magnetization. User data is encoded using an encoding scheme, such as [[run-length limited]] encoding,{{Efn|Historically a variety of run-length limited codes have been used in magnetic recording including for example, codes named [[Frequency modulation|FM]], [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] and [[Group Code Recording|GCR]] which are no longer used in modern HDDs.}} which determines how the data is represented by the magnetic transitions.\n\nA typical HDD design consists of a ''{{visible anchor|spindle|Spindle}}'' that holds flat circular disks, also called [[hard disk platter|platters]], which hold the recorded data. The platters are made from a non-magnetic material, usually aluminum alloy, glass, or ceramic, and are coated with a shallow layer of magnetic material typically 10\u201320 [[nanometer|nm]] in depth, with an outer layer of carbon for protection.<ref name=\"headcrash\" /><ref name=\"AutoMK-6\" /><ref name=\"AutoMK-7\" /> For reference, a standard piece of copy paper is {{convert|0.07|-|0.18|mm|nm|sp=us}}.<ref name=\"AutoMK-8\" />\n\n[[File:Hard drive-en.svg|thumb|left|Diagram labeling the major components of a computer HDD]]\n[[File:Aufnahme einzelner Magnetisierungen gespeicherter Bits auf einem Festplatten-Platter..jpg|thumb|Recording of single magnetisations of bits on a 200&nbsp;MB HDD-platter (recording made visible using CMOS-MagView).<ref name=\"AutoMK-9\" />]]\n[[File:Perpendicular Recording Diagram.svg|thumb|[[Longitudinal recording]] (standard) & [[perpendicular recording]] diagram]]\n\nThe platters in contemporary HDDs are spun at speeds varying from 4,200&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|rpm]] in energy-efficient portable devices, to 15,000&nbsp;rpm for high-performance servers.<ref name=\"AutoMK-10\" /> The first HDDs spun at 1,200&nbsp;rpm<ref name=\"IBM350\" /> and, for many years, 3,600&nbsp;rpm was the norm.<ref name=\"AutoMK-12\" /> As of December 2013, the platters in most consumer-grade HDDs spin at either 5,400&nbsp;rpm or 7,200&nbsp;rpm.<ref>{{cite web|title=Choosing High Performance Storage is not about RPM any more|url=http://www.seagate.com/in/en/tech-insights/choosing-high-performance-storage-is-not-about-rpm-anymore-master-ti/|publisher=Seagate|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\nInformation is written to and read from a platter as it rotates past devices called [[disk read-and-write head|read-and-write heads]] that are positioned to operate very close to the magnetic surface, with their [[flying height]] often in the range of tens of nanometers. The read-and-write head is used to detect and modify the magnetization of the material passing immediately under it.\n\nIn modern drives, there is one head for each magnetic platter surface on the spindle, mounted on a common arm. An actuator arm (or access arm) moves the heads on an arc (roughly radially) across the platters as they spin, allowing each head to access almost the entire surface of the platter as it spins. The arm is moved using a [[voice coil]] actuator or in some older designs a [[stepper motor]]. Early hard disk drives wrote data at some constant bits per second, resulting in all tracks having the same amount of data per track but modern drives (since the 1990s) use [[zone bit recording]]\u2014increasing the write speed from inner to outer zone and thereby storing more data per track in the outer zones.\n\nIn modern drives, the small size of the magnetic regions creates the danger that their magnetic state might be lost because of [[superparamagnetism|thermal effects]], thermally induced magnetic instability which is commonly known as the \"[[superparamagnetic limit]]\". To counter this, the platters are coated with two parallel magnetic layers, separated by a 3-atom layer of the non-magnetic element [[ruthenium]], and the two layers are magnetized in opposite orientation, thus reinforcing each other.<ref name=\"AutoMK-15\" /> Another technology used to overcome thermal effects to allow greater recording densities is [[perpendicular recording]], first shipped in 2005,<ref name=\"AutoMK-16\" /> and as of 2007 the technology was used in many HDDs.<ref name=\"AutoMK-17\" /><ref name=\"AutoMK-18\" /><ref name=\"AutoMK-19\" />\n\nIn 2004, a new concept was introduced to allow further increase of the data density in magnetic recording, using recording media consisting of coupled soft and hard magnetic layers. That so-called ''[[exchange spring media]]'', also known as ''exchange coupled composite media'', allows good writability due to the write-assist nature of the soft layer. However, the thermal stability is determined only by the hardest layer and not influenced by the soft layer.<ref name=AutoMK-19a /><ref name=AutoMK-19b />\n\n=== Components ===\n[[File:Hard disk dismantled.jpg|thumb|left|HDD with disks and motor hub removed exposing copper colored stator coils surrounding a bearing in the center of the spindle motor. Orange stripe along the side of the arm is thin printed-circuit cable, spindle bearing is in the center and the actuator is in the upper left]]\n\nA typical HDD has two electric motors; a spindle motor that spins the disks and an actuator (motor) that positions the read/write head assembly across the spinning disks. The disk motor has an external rotor attached to the disks; the stator windings are fixed in place. Opposite the actuator at the end of the head support arm is the read-write head; thin printed-circuit cables connect the read-write heads to amplifier electronics mounted at the pivot of the actuator. The head support arm is very light, but also stiff; in modern drives, acceleration at the head reaches 550 [[g-force|''g'']].\n\n[[File:Kopftraeger WD2500JS-00MHB0.jpg|thumb|Head stack with an actuator coil on the left and read/write heads on the right]]\n\nThe ''{{visible anchor|actuator|Actuator}}'' is a [[permanent magnet]] and [[moving coil]] motor that swings the heads to the desired position. A metal plate supports a squat [[neodymium magnet|neodymium-iron-boron]] (NIB) high-flux [[magnet]]. Beneath this plate is the moving coil, often referred to as the ''[[voice coil]]'' by analogy to the coil in [[loudspeaker]]s, which is attached to the actuator hub, and beneath that is a second NIB magnet, mounted on the bottom plate of the motor (some drives have only one magnet).\n\nThe voice coil itself is shaped rather like an arrowhead, and made of doubly coated copper [[magnet wire]]. The inner layer is insulation, and the outer is thermoplastic, which bonds the coil together after it is wound on a form, making it self-supporting. The portions of the coil along the two sides of the arrowhead (which point to the actuator bearing center) interact with the [[magnetic field]], developing a tangential force that rotates the actuator. Current flowing radially outward along one side of the arrowhead and radially inward on the other produces the [[magnetic field#Force on a charged particle|tangential force]]. If the magnetic field were uniform, each side would generate opposing forces that would cancel each other out. Therefore, the surface of the magnet is half north pole and half south pole, with the radial dividing line in the middle, causing the two sides of the coil to see opposite magnetic fields and produce forces that add instead of canceling. Currents along the top and bottom of the coil produce radial forces that do not rotate the head.\n\nThe HDD's electronics control the movement of the actuator and the rotation of the disk, and perform reads and writes on demand from the [[disk controller]]. Feedback of the drive electronics is accomplished by means of special segments of the disk dedicated to servo feedback. These are either complete concentric circles (in the case of dedicated servo technology), or segments interspersed with real data (in the case of embedded servo technology). The servo feedback optimizes the signal to noise ratio of the GMR sensors by adjusting the voice-coil of the actuated arm. The spinning of the disk also uses a servo motor. Modern disk firmware is capable of scheduling reads and writes efficiently on the platter surfaces and remapping sectors of the media which have failed.\n\n=== {{anchor|ERRORRATESHANDLING}}Error rates and handling ===\nModern drives make extensive use of [[forward error correction|error correction codes]] (ECCs), particularly [[Reed\u2013Solomon error correction]]. These techniques store extra bits, determined by mathematical formulas, for each block of data; the extra bits allow many errors to be corrected invisibly. The extra bits themselves take up space on the HDD, but allow higher recording densities to be employed without causing uncorrectable errors, resulting in much larger storage capacity.<ref name=\"AutoMK-20\" /> For example, a typical 1&nbsp;[[Terabyte|TB]] hard disk with 512-byte sectors provides additional capacity of about 93&nbsp;[[Gibibyte|GB]] for the [[Forward error correction|ECC]] data.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.idema.org/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2011/12/AF-in-Legacy-Infrastructures-SDC2011_IDEMA-AF.pdf\n | title = Advanced Format in Legacy Infrastructures: More Transparent than Disruptive\n | format = PDF | year = 2011 | accessdate = 2013-11-05\n | author = Curtis E.

The difference in capacity reported in true SI-based units vs. [[binary prefixes]] can lead to a false impression of missing capacity.\n\n=== Calculation ===\nModern hard disk drives appear to their host controller as a contiguous set of logical blocks, and the gross drive capacity is calculated by multiplying the number of blocks by the block size. This information is available from the manufacturer's product specification, and from the drive itself through use of operating system functions that invoke low-level drive commands.<ref name=\"SAS\" /><ref name=\"SATA\" />\n\nThe gross capacity of older HDDs is calculated as the product of the number of [[cylinder (disk drive)|cylinders]] per recording zone, the number of bytes per sector (most commonly 512), and the count of [[Zone bit recording|zones]] of the drive.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Some modern SATA drives also report [[cylinder-head-sector]] (CHS) capacities, but these are not physical parameters because the reported values are constrained by historic operating system interfaces. The C/H/S scheme has been replaced by [[logical block addressing]] (LBA), a simple linear addressing scheme that locates blocks by an integer index, which starts at LBA 0 for the first block and increments thereafter.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.idema.org/wp-content/plugins/download-monitor/download.php?id=1223\n | title = LBA Count for Disk Drives Standard (Document LBA1-03)\n | date = 2009-06-15 | accessdate = 2016-02-14\n | publisher = [[IDEMA]] | format = PDF\n}}</ref> When using the C/H/S method to describe modern large drives, the number of heads is often set to 64, although a typical hard disk drive, {{as of|2013|lc=yes}}, has between one and four platters.\n\nIn modern HDDs, spare capacity for defect management is not included in the published capacity; however, in many early HDDs a certain number of sectors were reserved as spares, thereby reducing the capacity available to the operating system.\n\nFor [[RAID]] subsystems, data integrity and fault-tolerance requirements also reduce the realized capacity. For example, a RAID&nbsp;1 array has about half the total capacity as a result of data mirroring, while a RAID&nbsp;5 array with {{mvar|x}} drives loses {{mvar|1/x}} of capacity (which equals to the capacity of a single drive) due to storing parity information. RAID subsystems are multiple drives that appear to be one drive or more drives to the user, but provide fault tolerance. Most RAID vendors use [[checksum]]s to improve data integrity at the block level.  Some vendors design systems using HDDs with sectors of 520 bytes to contain 512 bytes of user data and eight checksum bytes, or by using separate 512-byte sectors for the checksum data.<ref name=\"AutoMK-38\" />\n\nSome systems may use hidden [[disk partitioning|partitions]] for system recovery, reducing the capacity available to the end user.\n\n=== System use ===\n{{Main article|Disk formatting}}\n\nThe presentation of a hard disk drive to its host is determined by the [[disk controller]]. The actual presentation may differ substantially from the drive's native [[interface (computing)|interface]], particularly in [[mainframe computer|mainframes]] or [[server computer|servers]]. Modern HDDs, such as SAS<ref name=\"SAS\" /> and SATA<ref name=\"SATA\" /> drives, appear at their interfaces as a contiguous set of logical blocks that are typically 512 bytes long, though the industry is in the process of changing to the 4,096-byte logical blocks layout, known as the [[Advanced Format]] (AF).<ref name=\"AutoMK-35\" />\n\nThe process of initializing these logical blocks on the physical disk platters is called ''low-level formatting'', which is usually performed at the factory and is not normally changed in the field.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/geom/formatLow-c.html|title=Low-Level Formatting|publisher=}}</ref>{{Efn|However, some enterprise SAS drives have other block sizes such as 520, 524 and 528 bytes, which can be changed in the field.}} As a next step in preparing an HDD for use, ''high-level formatting'' writes [[Disk partitioning|partition]] and [[file system]] structures into selected logical blocks to make the remaining logical blocks available to the host's [[operating system]] and its applications.<ref name=\"AutoMK-37\" /> The file system uses some of the disk space to structure the HDD and organize files, recording their file names and the sequence of disk areas that represent the file. Examples of data structures stored on disk to retrieve files include the [[File Allocation Table]] (FAT) in the [[DOS]] file system and [[inode]]s in many [[UNIX]] file systems, as well as other operating system data structures (also known as [[metadata]]). As a consequence, not all the space on an HDD is available for user files, but this system overhead is usually negligible.\n\n=== Units ===\n{{See also|binary prefix#disk drives}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"width: 60%; margin-left: 1.5em;\"\n|+ Decimal and binary [[unit prefix]]es interpretation<ref name=\"SeagateStorageGuide\" /><ref name=\"WD2\" />\n! colspan=2 rowspan=2 | Capacity advertised by manufacturers{{Efn|name=\"units-decimal\"|Expressed using [[SI prefix#List of SI prefixes|decimal&nbsp;multiples]].}}\n! colspan=2 rowspan=2 | Capacity expected by some consumers{{Efn|name=\"units-binary\"|Expressed using [[binary prefix|binary&nbsp;multiples]].}}\n! colspan=2 | Reported capacity\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | [[Windows]], [[Linux]]{{Efn|name=\"units-binary\"}}\n! rowspan=2 | [[macOS]]<br />10.6+{{Efn|name=\"units-decimal\"}}\n|-\n!

a stack of fifty 24-inch platters and was of a size comparable to two large refrigerators. In 1962, [[IBM]] introduced its [[IBM 1311|model 1311]] disk, which used six 14-inch (nominal size) platters in a removable pack and was roughly the size of a washing machine. This became a standard platter size and drive form-factor for many years, used also by other manufacturers.<ref name=\"AutoMK-39\" /> The [[IBM 2314]] used platters of the same size in an eleven-high pack and introduced the \"drive in a drawer\" layout, although the \"drawer\" was not the complete drive.\n\nLater drives were designed to fit entirely into a chassis that would mount in a [[19-inch rack]]. Digital's [[RK05]] and RL01 were early examples using single 14-inch platters in removable packs, the entire drive fitting in a 10.5-inch-high rack space (six rack units).  In the mid-to-late 1980s the similarly sized [[Fujitsu Eagle]], which used (coincidentally) 10.5-inch platters, was a popular product.\n\nSuch large platters were never used with microprocessor-based systems.  With increasing sales of microcomputers having built in [[floppy disk|floppy-disk drives (FDDs)]], HDDs that would fit to the FDD mountings became desirable. Thus HDD ''Form factors'', initially followed those of 8-inch, 5.25-inch, and 3.5-inch floppy disk drives. Because there were no smaller floppy disk drives, smaller HDD form factors developed from product offerings or industry standards.\n\n; {{Anchor|8 inch}}8-inch\n: {{val|9.5|u=in}} \u00d7 {{val|4.624|u=in}} \u00d7 {{val|14.25|u=in}} ({{val|241.3|u=mm}} \u00d7 {{val|117.5|u=mm}} \u00d7 {{val|362|u=mm}}).

This smaller form factor, first used in an HDD by Seagate in 1980,<ref name=\"AutoMK-40\" /> was the same size as full-height {{convert|5+1/4|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} FDD, 3.25-inches high. This is twice as high as \"half height\"; i.e., 1.63&nbsp;in (41.4&nbsp;mm). Most desktop models of drives for optical 120&nbsp;mm disks (DVD, CD) use the half height 5\u00bc\" dimension, but it fell out of fashion for HDDs. The format was standardized as [[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]]-741 and co-published as [[Small Form Factor committee|SFF]]-8501 for disk drives, with other SFF-85xx series standards covering related 5.25&nbsp;inch devices (optical drives, etc.)<ref>{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.seagate.com/sff/SFF-8500.PDF |title=SFF-8500 Specification for Suite of 5.25\" Form Factor Specifications |format=PDF |publisher=[[Small Form Factor committee|SFF Committee]]|date=June 5, 1995 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref> The [[Quantum Bigfoot]] HDD was the last to use it in the late 1990s, with \"low-profile\" (\u224825&nbsp;mm) and \"ultra-low-profile\" (\u224820&nbsp;mm) high versions.\n; {{Anchor|3.5 inch}}3.5-inch\n: 4&nbsp;in \u00d7 1&nbsp;in \u00d7 5.75&nbsp;in (101.6&nbsp;mm \u00d7 25.4&nbsp;mm \u00d7 146&nbsp;mm) = 376.77344&nbsp;cm\u00b3.

Toshiba manufactured a 4&nbsp;GB (MK4001MTD) and an 8&nbsp;GB (MK8003MTD) version and holds the [[Guinness World Record]] for the smallest HDD.<ref name=\"AutoMK-49\" /><ref name=\"AutoMK-50\" />\n\n{{As of|2012}}, 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch hard disks were the most popular sizes.\n\nBy 2009, all manufacturers had discontinued the development of new products for the 1.3-inch, 1-inch and 0.85-inch form factors due to falling prices of [[flash memory]],<ref name=\"AutoMK-51\" /><ref name=\"AutoMK-52\" /> which has no moving parts.\n\nWhile these sizes are customarily described by an approximately correct figure in inches, actual sizes have long been specified in millimeters.\n\n== Performance characteristics ==\n{{Main article|hard disk drive performance characteristics}}\n\n=== Time to access data ===\nThe factors that limit the [[access time|time to access the data]] on an HDD are mostly related to the mechanical nature of the rotating disks and moving heads. [[Seek time]] is a measure of how long it takes the head assembly to travel to the track of the disk that contains data. [[Disk drive performance characteristics#Rotational latency|Rotational latency]] is incurred because the desired disk sector may not be directly under the head when data transfer is requested. These two delays are on the order of milliseconds each. The [[bit rate]] or data transfer rate (once the head is in the right position) creates delay which is a function of the number of blocks transferred; typically relatively small, but can be quite long with the transfer of large contiguous files. Delay may also occur if the drive disks are stopped to save energy.\n\nAn HDD's ''Average Access Time'' is its average [[seek time]] which technically is the time to do all possible seeks divided by the number of all possible seeks, but in practice is determined by statistical methods or simply approximated as the time of a seek over one-third of the number of tracks.<ref name=\"AutoMK-66\" />\n\n[[Defragmentation]] is a procedure used to minimize delay in retrieving data by moving related items to physically proximate areas on the disk.<ref name=\"itworld-2001-04-18\" /> Some computer operating systems perform defragmentation automatically. Although automatic defragmentation is intended to reduce access delays, performance will be temporarily reduced while the procedure is in progress.<ref name=\"AutoMK-67\" />\n\n[[Access time|Time to access data]] can be improved by increasing rotational speed (thus reducing latency) or by reducing the time spent seeking. Increasing areal density increases [[throughput]] by increasing data rate and by increasing the amount of data under a set of heads, thereby potentially reducing seek activity for a given amount of data. The time to access data has not kept up with throughput increases, which themselves have not kept up with growth in bit density and storage capacity.\n\n=== {{anchor|SEEKTIME}}Seek time ===\n{{See also|hard disk drive performance characteristics#seek time|short-stroking}}\n\nAverage [[seek time]] ranges from under 4&nbsp;[[millisecond|ms]] for high-end server drives<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.anandtech.com/show/3636/western-digitals-new-velociraptor-vr200m-10k-rpm-at-450gb-and-600gb\n | title = Western Digital's New VelociRaptor VR200M: 10K&nbsp;RPM at 450GB and 600GB\n | date = 2010-04-06 | accessdate = 2013-12-19\n | author = Anand Lal Shimpi | website = anandtech.com\n}}</ref> to 15&nbsp;ms for mobile drives, with the most common mobile drives at about 12&nbsp;ms<ref name=\"WD-Scorpio Blue-specs\" /> and the most common desktop type typically being around 9&nbsp;ms. The first HDD had an average seek time of about 600&nbsp;ms;<ref name=\"IBM350\" /> by the middle of 1970s, HDDs were available with seek times of about 25&nbsp;ms.<ref name=\"AutoMK-70\" /> Some early PC drives used a [[stepper motor]] to move the heads, and as a result had seek times as slow as 80\u2013120&nbsp;ms, but this was quickly improved by [[voice coil]] type actuation in the 1980s, reducing seek times to around 20&nbsp;ms. Seek time has continued to improve slowly over time.\n\nSome desktop and laptop computer systems allow the user to make a tradeoff between seek performance and drive noise. Faster seek rates typically require more energy usage to quickly move the heads across the platter, causing louder noises from the pivot bearing and greater device vibrations as the heads are rapidly accelerated during the start of the seek motion and decelerated at the end of the seek motion. Quiet operation reduces movement speed and acceleration rates, but at a cost of reduced seek performance.\n\n=== Latency ===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"margin-left: 1.5em;\"\n|-\n! Rotational speed<br />[rpm]\n!

It depends on rotational speed of a disk, measured in [[revolutions per minute]] (rpm). Average rotational latency is shown in the table on the right, based on the statistical relation that the average latency in milliseconds for such a drive is one-half the rotational period. Average latency (in milliseconds) is computed as 30,000 divided by rotational speed (in rpm).{{efn|{{math|latency {{=}} {{sfrac|1|{{sfrac|''R'' rotations|minute}}}} \u00d7 {{sfrac|60 seconds|1 minute}} \u00d7 {{sfrac|1000 ms|1 second}}}} {{math| \u00d7 {{sfrac|1 rotation|2 half-rotations}} {{=}} {{sfrac|30000|''R''}} {{sfrac|ms|half-rotation}} }} }}\n\n=== Data transfer rate ===\n{{As of|2010}}, a typical 7,200-rpm desktop HDD has a sustained \"disk-to-[[disk buffer|buffer]]\" data transfer rate up to 1,030&nbsp;[[Mbit/s]].<ref name=\"AutoMK-71\" /> This rate depends on the track location; the rate is higher for data on the outer tracks (where there are more data sectors per rotation) and lower toward the inner tracks (where there are fewer data sectors per rotation); and is generally somewhat higher for 10,000-rpm drives. A current widely used standard for the \"buffer-to-computer\" interface is 3.0&nbsp;[[Gbit/s]] SATA, which can send about 300 megabyte/s (10-bit encoding) from the buffer to the computer, and thus is still comfortably ahead of today's disk-to-buffer transfer rates. Data transfer rate (read/write) can be measured by writing a large file to disk using special file generator tools, then reading back the file. Transfer rate can be influenced by [[file system fragmentation]] and the layout of the files.<ref name=\"itworld-2001-04-18\" />\n\nHDD data transfer rate depends upon the rotational speed of the platters and the data recording density. Because heat and vibration limit rotational speed, advancing density becomes the main method to improve sequential transfer rates. Higher speeds require a more powerful spindle motor, which creates more heat. While areal density advances by increasing both the number of tracks across the disk and the number of sectors per track, only the latter increases the data transfer rate for a given rpm. Since data transfer rate performance tracks only one of the two components of areal density, its performance improves at a lower rate.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n=== Other considerations ===\nOther performance considerations include quality-adjusted [[price index|price]], power consumption, audible noise, and both operating and non-operating shock resistance.\n\nThe [[Federal Reserve Board]] has a quality-adjusted [[price index]] for large-scale enterprise storage systems including three or more enterprise HDDs and associated controllers, racks and cables. Prices for these large-scale storage systems improved at the rate of \u201230% per year during 2004\u20132009 and \u201222% per year during 2009\u20132014.<ref name=\"Byrne2015b\"/>\n\n== Access and interfaces ==\n{{Main article|hard disk drive interface}}\n[[File:Seagate ST33232A hard disk inner view.jpg|thumb|right|Inner view of a 1998 [[Seagate Technology|Seagate]] HDD that used [[Parallel ATA]] interface]]\n[[File:2.5-inch SATA drive on top of a 3.5-inch SATA drive, close-up of data and power connectors.jpg|thumb|right|2.5-inch SATA drive on top of a 3.5-inch SATA drive, close-up of data and power connectors]]\n\nHDDs are accessed over one of a number of [[bus (computing)|bus]] types, including {{As of|2011|lc=on}} parallel [[Advanced Technology Attachment|ATA]] (PATA, also called IDE or [[AT Attachment#EIDE and ATA-2|EIDE]]; described before the introduction of SATA as ATA), [[Serial ATA]] (SATA), [[SCSI]], [[Serial Attached SCSI]] (SAS), and [[Fibre Channel]]. Bridge circuitry is sometimes used to connect HDDs to buses with which they cannot communicate natively, such as [[IEEE 1394 interface|IEEE&nbsp;1394]], [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] and [[Small Computer System Interface|SCSI]].\n\nModern HDDs present a consistent interface to the rest of the computer, no matter what data encoding scheme is used internally. Typically a [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] in the electronics inside the HDD takes the raw analog voltages from the read head and uses [[partial response maximum likelihood|PRML]] and [[Reed\u2013Solomon error correction]]<ref name=\"AutoMK-79\" /> to decode the sector boundaries and sector data, then sends that data out the standard interface. That DSP also watches the error rate detected by [[error detection and correction]], and performs [[bad sector]] remapping, data collection for [[Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology]], and other internal tasks.\n\nModern interfaces connect an HDD to a host bus interface adapter (today typically integrated into the \"[[Southbridge (computing)|south bridge]]\") with one data/control cable. Each drive also has an additional power cable, usually direct to the power supply unit.\n\n* [[Small Computer System Interface]] (SCSI), originally named SASI for Shugart Associates System Interface, was standard on servers, workstations, [[Amiga peripherals|Commodore Amiga]], [[Atari ST]] and [[Apple Macintosh]] computers through the mid-1990s, by which time most models had been transitioned to IDE (and later, SATA) family disks. The range limitations of the data cable allows for external SCSI devices.\n* [[Integrated Drive Electronics]] (IDE), later standardized under the name [[AT Attachment]] (ATA, with the alias P-ATA or PATA ([[Parallel ATA]]) retroactively added upon introduction of SATA) moved the HDD controller from the interface card to the disk drive. This helped to standardize the host/controller interface, reduce the programming complexity in the host device driver, and reduced system cost and complexity. The 40-pin IDE/ATA connection transfers 16&nbsp;bits of data at a time on the data cable. The data cable was originally 40-conductor, but later higher speed requirements for data transfer to and from the HDD led to an \"ultra DMA\" mode, known as [[AT Attachment#Parallel ATA interface|UDMA]]. Progressively swifter versions of this standard ultimately added the requirement for an 80-conductor variant of the same cable, where half of the conductors provides [[ground (electricity)|grounding]] necessary for enhanced high-speed signal quality by reducing [[crosstalk (electronics)|cross talk]].\n* EIDE was an unofficial update (by Western Digital) to the original IDE standard, with the key improvement being the use of [[direct memory access]] (DMA) to transfer data between the disk and the computer without the involvement of the [[central processing unit|CPU]], an improvement later adopted by the official ATA standards. By directly transferring data between memory and disk, DMA eliminates the need for the CPU to copy byte per byte, therefore allowing it to process other tasks while the data transfer occurs.\n* [[Fibre Channel]] (FC) is a successor to parallel SCSI interface on enterprise market. It is a serial protocol. In disk drives usually the [[Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop]] (FC-AL) connection topology is used. FC has much broader usage than mere disk interfaces, and it is the cornerstone of [[storage area network]]s (SANs). Recently other protocols for this field, like [[iSCSI]] and [[ATA over Ethernet]] have been developed as well. Confusingly, drives usually use ''copper'' twisted-pair cables for Fibre Channel, not fibre optics. The latter are traditionally reserved for larger devices, such as servers or [[disk array controller]]s.\n* [[Serial Attached SCSI]] (SAS). The SAS is a new generation serial communication protocol for devices designed to allow for much higher speed data transfers and is compatible with SATA. SAS uses a mechanically identical data and power connector to standard 3.5-inch SATA1/SATA2 HDDs, and many server-oriented SAS RAID controllers are also capable of addressing SATA HDDs. SAS uses serial communication instead of the parallel method found in traditional SCSI devices but still uses SCSI commands.\n* [[Serial ATA]] (SATA). The SATA data cable has one data pair for differential transmission of data to the device, and one pair for differential receiving from the device, just like [[EIA-422]]. That requires that data be transmitted serially. A similar [[differential signaling]] system is used in [[RS485]], [[LocalTalk]], [[USB]], [[FireWire]], and differential [[SCSI]].\n\n== Integrity and failure ==\n[[File:Hard disk head.jpg|thumb|Close-up of an HDD head resting on a disk platter; its mirror reflection is visible on the platter surface.]]\n{{Main article|hard disk drive failure|Data recovery}}\n\nDue to the extremely close spacing between the heads and the disk surface, HDDs are vulnerable to being damaged by a [[head crash]]\u2014a [[hard disk failure|failure of the disk]] in which the head scrapes across the platter surface, often grinding away the thin magnetic film and causing data loss. Head crashes can be caused by electronic failure, a sudden power failure, physical shock, contamination of the drive's internal enclosure, wear and tear, [[corrosion]], or poorly manufactured platters and heads.\n\nThe HDD's spindle system relies on [[air density]] inside the [[disk enclosure]] to support the heads at their proper [[flying height]] while the disk rotates. HDDs require a certain range of air densities in order to operate properly. The connection to the external environment and density occurs through a small hole in the enclosure (about 0.5&nbsp;mm in breadth), usually with a filter on the inside (the ''breather filter'').<ref name=\"AutoMK-80\" /> If the air density is too low, then there is not enough lift for the flying head, so the head gets too close to the disk, and there is a risk of head crashes and data loss. Specially manufactured sealed and pressurized disks are needed for reliable high-altitude operation, above about {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"AutoMK-81\" /> Modern disks include temperature sensors and adjust their operation to the operating environment. Breather holes can be seen on all disk drives\u2014they usually have a sticker next to them, warning the user not to cover the holes. The air inside the operating drive is constantly moving too, being swept in motion by friction with the spinning platters. This air passes through an internal recirculation (or \"recirc\") filter to remove any leftover contaminants from manufacture, any particles or chemicals that may have somehow entered the enclosure, and any particles or outgassing generated internally in normal operation. Very high humidity present for extended periods of time can corrode the heads and platters.\n\nFor [[giant magnetoresistive effect|giant magnetoresistive]] (GMR) heads in particular, a minor head crash from contamination (that does not remove the magnetic surface of the disk) still results in the head temporarily overheating, due to friction with the disk surface, and can render the data unreadable for a short period until the head temperature stabilizes (so called \"thermal asperity\", a problem which can partially be dealt with by proper electronic filtering of the read signal).\n\nWhen the logic board of a hard disk fails, the drive can often be restored to functioning order and the data recovered by replacing the circuit board with one of an identical hard disk. In the case of read-write head faults, they can be replaced using specialized tools in a dust-free environment. If the disk platters are undamaged, they can be transferred into an identical enclosure and the data can be copied or cloned onto a new drive. In the event of disk-platter failures, disassembly and imaging of the disk platters may be required.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/how-to-tech/how-to-recover-data-hard-drive4.htm|title=How To Recover Lost Data from Your Hard Drive|last=Grabianowski|first=Ed|publisher=HowStuffWorks|pages=5\u20136|accessdate=24 October 2012}}</ref> For logical damage to file systems, a variety of tools, including [[fsck]] on [[UNIX-like]] systems and [[CHKDSK]] on [[Windows]], can be used for [[data recovery]].

Mobile HDDs spin at 4,200&nbsp;rpm, 5,200&nbsp;rpm, 5,400&nbsp;rpm, or 7,200&nbsp;rpm, with 5,400&nbsp;rpm being typical. 7,200&nbsp;rpm drives tend to be more expensive and have smaller capacities, while 4,200&nbsp;rpm models usually have very high storage capacities. Because of smaller platter(s), mobile HDDs generally have lower capacity than their greater desktop counterparts.\n: There are also 2.5-inch drives spinning at 10,000&nbsp;rpm, which belong to the enterprise segment with no intention to be used in laptops.\n\n; Enterprise HDDs\n: Typically used with multiple-user computers running [[enterprise software]]. Examples are: transaction processing databases, internet infrastructure (email, webserver, e-commerce), scientific computing software, and nearline storage management software. Enterprise drives commonly operate continuously (\"24/7\") in demanding environments while delivering the highest possible performance without sacrificing reliability. Maximum capacity is not the primary goal, and as a result the drives are often offered in capacities that are relatively low in relation to their cost.<ref name=\"AutoMK-99\" />\n: The fastest enterprise HDDs spin at 10,000 or 15,000&nbsp;rpm, and can achieve sequential media transfer speeds above 1.6&nbsp;Gbit/s<ref name=\"erwpnw\" /> and a sustained transfer rate up to 1&nbsp;Gbit/s.<ref name=\"erwpnw\" /> Drives running at 10,000 or 15,000&nbsp;rpm use smaller platters to mitigate increased power requirements (as they have less [[air drag]]) and therefore generally have lower capacity than the highest capacity desktop drives.
