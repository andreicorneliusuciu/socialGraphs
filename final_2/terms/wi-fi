The \"Wi-Fi Certified\" trademark can only be used by Wi-Fi products that successfully complete Wi-Fi Alliance [[interoperability]] certification testing.\n\nDevices that can use Wi-Fi technology include personal computers, video-game consoles, [[smartphone]]s, digital cameras, [[tablet computer]]s, digital audio players and modern printers. Wi-Fi compatible devices can connect to the Internet via a WLAN network and a [[wireless access point]]. Such an access point (or [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspot]]) has a range of about {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} indoors and a greater range outdoors.

Web pages that use [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] are secure, but unencrypted Internet access can easily be detected by intruders. Because of this, Wi-Fi has adopted various [[encryption]] technologies. The early encryption [[Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP]] proved easy to break. Higher quality protocols ([[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA, WPA2]]) were added later. An optional feature added in 2007, called [[Wi-Fi Protected Setup]] (WPS), had a serious flaw that allowed an attacker to recover the router's password.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sviehb.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/viehboeck_wps.pdf |title=Brute forcing Wi-Fi Protected Setup |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-06-15}}</ref> The Wi-Fi Alliance has since updated its test plan and certification program to ensure all newly certified devices resist attacks.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main article|IEEE 802.11#History}}\nIn 1971, [[ALOHAnet]] connected the Hawaiian Islands with a UHF wireless packet network.

The coverage of one or more interconnected [[Wireless access point|access points]] (''hotspots'') can extend from an area as small as a few rooms to as large as many square kilometres. Coverage in the larger area may require a group of access points with overlapping coverage. For example, public outdoor Wi-Fi technology has been used successfully in [[wireless mesh network]]s in London, UK. An international example is [[Fon (company)|Fon]].\n\nWi-Fi provides service in private homes, businesses, as well as in public spaces at Wi-Fi hotspots set up either free-of-charge or commercially, often using a [[captive portal]] webpage for access. Organizations and [[business]]es, such as airports, hotels, and restaurants, often provide free-use hotspots to attract customers. Enthusiasts or authorities who wish to provide services or even to promote business in selected areas sometimes provide free Wi-Fi access.\n\n[[Router (computing)|Routers]] that incorporate a [[digital subscriber line]] modem or a [[cable modem]] and a Wi-Fi access point, often set up in homes and other buildings, provide Internet access and [[internetworking]] to all devices connected to them, wirelessly or via cable.\n\nSimilarly, battery-powered routers may include a cellular Internet radiomodem and Wi-Fi access point. When subscribed to a cellular data carrier, they allow nearby Wi-Fi stations to access the Internet over 2G, 3G, or 4G networks using the [[tethering]] technique. Many smartphones have a built-in capability of this sort, including those based on [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[BlackBerry]], [[Bada]], [[iOS]] ([[iPhone]]), [[Windows Phone]] and [[Symbian]], though carriers often disable the feature, or charge a separate fee to enable it, especially for customers with unlimited data plans. \"Internet packs\" provide standalone facilities of this type as well, without use of a smartphone; examples include the [[MiFi]]- and [[WiBro]]-branded devices. Some laptops that have a cellular modem card can also act as mobile Internet Wi-Fi access points.\n\nWi-Fi also connects places that normally don't have network access, such as kitchens and garden sheds.\n\n=== City-wide Wi-Fi ===\n{{Further information|Municipal wireless network}}\n[[File:Metro Wireless Node.jpg|thumb|An outdoor Wi-Fi access point]]\nIn the early 2000s, many cities around the world announced plans to construct citywide Wi-Fi networks.

Because of this choice of frequency band, 802.11b and g equipment may occasionally suffer [[Interference (communication)|interference]] from [[microwave oven]]s, [[cordless telephone]]s, and [[Bluetooth]] devices.\n\nSpectrum assignments and operational limitations are not consistent worldwide: Australia and Europe allow for an additional two channels (12, 13) beyond the 11 permitted in the United States for the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band, while Japan has three more (12\u201314). In the US and other countries, 802.11a and 802.11g devices may be operated without a license, as allowed in Part 15 of the FCC Rules and Regulations.\n\nA Wi-Fi signal occupies five channels in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band. Any two channel numbers that differ by five or more, such as 2 and 7, do not overlap. The oft-repeated adage that channels 1, 6, and 11 are the ''only'' non-overlapping channels is, therefore, not accurate. Channels 1, 6, and 11 are the only ''group of three'' non-overlapping channels in North America and the United Kingdom. In Europe and Japan using Channels 1, 5, 9, and 13 for [[IEEE 802.11#802.11g|802.11g]] and [[IEEE 802.11#802.11n|802.11n]] is [[IEEE 802.11#Channels and international compatibility|recommended]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n802.11a uses the [[U-NII|5&nbsp;GHz U-NII band]], which, for much of the world, offers at least 23 non-overlapping channels rather than the 2.4&nbsp;GHz ISM frequency band, where adjacent channels overlap.\n\n=== Interference ===\n{{Details|Electromagnetic interference at 2.4 GHz}}\nWi-Fi connections can be disrupted or the Internet speed lowered by having other devices in the same area. Many 2.4&nbsp;GHz 802.11b and [[IEEE 802.11#802.11g|802.11g]] access-points default to the same channel on initial startup, contributing to congestion on certain channels. Wi-Fi pollution, or an excessive number of access points in the area, especially on the neighboring channel, can prevent access and interfere with other devices' use of other access points, caused by overlapping channels in the 802.11g/b spectrum, as well as with decreased [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) between access points. This can become a problem in high-density areas, such as large apartment complexes or office buildings with many Wi-Fi access points. It is advised to only use channel 1-6-11.\n\nAdditionally, other devices use the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band: microwave ovens, [[ISM band]] devices, security cameras, [[ZigBee]] devices, [[Bluetooth]] devices, [[video sender]]s, cordless phones, [[baby monitor]]s,<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.monitorshq.com/6-easy-steps-to-protect-your-baby-monitor-from-hackers/|title=WiFi baby monitor security |publisher=MonitorsHQ.com |accessdate=2014-09-12 |last=Delia C.}}</ref> and, in some countries, [[amateur radio]], all of which can cause significant additional interference. It is also an issue when municipalities<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/municipal-wifi.htm|title=How Municipal WiFi Works |publisher=computer.howstuffworks.com|accessdate=2008-03-12|last=Wilson\n|first=Tracy V.}}</ref> or other large entities (such as universities) seek to provide large area coverage.\n\n== Service set identifier (SSID) ==\n{{See also|Service set (802.11 network)}}\nIn addition to running on different channels, multiple Wi-Fi networks can share channels.\n\nA [[Service set (802.11 network)|service set]] is the set of all the devices associated with a particular Wi-Fi network. The service set can be local, independent, extended or mesh.\n\nEach service set has an associated identifier, the 32-byte Service Set Identifier (SSID), which identifies the particular network. The SSID is configured within the devices that are considered part of the network, and it is transmitted in the packets. Receivers ignore wireless packets from networks with a different SSID.\n\n== Throughput ==\nAs the 802.11 specifications evolved to support higher throughput, the bandwidth requirements also increased to support them. 802.11n uses double the radio spectrum/bandwidth (40&nbsp;MHz) compared to [[IEEE 802.11#802.11a|802.11a]] or 802.11g (20&nbsp;MHz).[http://www.connect802.com/80211n_channels.htm 76] This means there can be only one 802.11n network on the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band at a given location, without interference to/from other WLAN traffic. 802.11n can also be set to limit itself to 20&nbsp;MHz bandwidth to prevent interference in dense community.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nMany newer consumer devices support the latest [[IEEE 802.11ac|802.11ac]] standard, which uses the 5&nbsp;GHz band exclusively and is capable of multi-station WLAN throughput of at least 1 gigabit per second. According to a study, devices with the 802.11ac specification were expected to be common by 2015 with an estimated one billion spread around the world.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Murph|first1=Darren|title=Study: 802.11ac devices to hit the one billion mark in 2015, get certified in 2048|url=http://www.engadget.com/2011/02/08/study-802-11ac-devices-to-hit-the-one-billion-mark-in-2015-get/|website=Engadget|accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Hardware ==\n[[File:Stupid HP.jpg|thumb|Wi-Fi whitelist triggered on an HP laptop]]\nWi-Fi allows cheaper deployment of [[local area network]]s (LANs). Also, spaces where cables cannot be run, such as outdoor areas and historical buildings, can host wireless LANs.  However, building walls of certain materials, such as stone with high metal content, can block Wi-Fi signals.\n\nManufacturers are building wireless network adapters into most laptops. The price of [[chipset]]s for Wi-Fi continues to drop, making it an economical networking option included in even more devices.<ref>Karan.

Products designated as \"Wi-Fi Certified\" by the Wi-Fi Alliance are [[backwards compatible]]. Unlike [[mobile phone]]s, any standard Wi-Fi device will work anywhere in the world.\n\n=== Standard devices ===\n[[File:RouterBoard 112 with U.FL-RSMA pigtail and R52 miniPCI Wi-Fi card.jpg|thumb|250px|An [[embedded system|embedded]] [[MikroTik#RouterBOARD|RouterBoard]] 112 with [[Hirose U.FL|U.FL]]-[[SMA connector|RSMA]] pigtail and R52 [[Conventional PCI|mini PCI]] Wi-Fi card widely used by [[wireless]] Internet service providers ([[Wireless Internet service provider|WISPs]]) in the [[Czech Republic]] ]]\n[[File:3GN.jpg|thumb|OSBRiDGE 3GN \u2013 [[IEEE 802.11n-2009|802.11n]] Access Point and [[High-Speed Downlink Packet Access|UMTS/GSM]] Gateway in one device]]\n[[File:EBWifi.JPG|thumb|An [[Atheros]] draft-N Wi-Fi adapter with built in [[Bluetooth]] on a Sony Vaio E series laptop]]\n[[File:Wireless adaptor USB.jpg|thumb|[[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] wireless adapter]]\n\nA [[wireless access point]] (WAP) connects a group of wireless devices to an adjacent wired [[Local area network|LAN]]. An access point resembles a [[Ethernet hub|network hub]], relaying [[data (computing)|data]] between connected wireless devices in addition to a (usually) single connected wired device, most often an Ethernet hub or switch, allowing wireless devices to communicate with other wired devices.\n\n[[Wireless network interface controller|Wireless adapters]] allow devices to connect to a wireless network. These adapters connect to devices using various external or internal interconnects such as PCI, miniPCI, [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], [[ExpressCard]], Cardbus and [[PC Card]]. {{As of| 2010}}, most newer laptop computers come equipped with built in internal adapters.\n\n[[Wireless router]]s integrate a Wireless Access Point, Ethernet [[network switch|switch]], and internal router firmware application that provides [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[routing]], [[Network address translation|NAT]], and [[Domain Name System|DNS]] forwarding through an integrated [[Wide area network|WAN]]-interface. A wireless router allows wired and wireless Ethernet LAN devices to connect to a (usually) single WAN device such as a [[cable modem]] or a [[DSL modem]]. A wireless router allows all three devices, mainly the access point and router, to be configured through one central utility. This utility is usually an integrated [[web server]] that is accessible to wired and wireless LAN clients and often optionally to WAN clients. This utility may also be an application that is run on a computer, as is the case with as Apple's [[AirPort]], which is managed with the [[AirPort Utility]] on [[Mac OS X]] and [[iOS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/features/utility.html|title=Apple.com Airport Utility Product Page|publisher=Apple, Inc.|accessdate=2011-06-14}}</ref>\n\nWireless [[Bridging (networking)|network bridges]] connect a wired network to a wireless network. A bridge differs from an access point: an access point connects wireless devices to a wired network at the [[OSI model#Layer 2: data link layer|data-link layer]]. Two wireless bridges may be used to connect two wired networks over a wireless link, useful in situations where a wired connection may be unavailable, such as between two separate homes or for devices which do not have wireless networking capability (but have wired networking capability), such as [[consumer entertainment device]]s; alternatively, a wireless bridge can be used to enable a device which supports a wired connection to operate at a wireless networking standard which is faster than supported by the wireless network connectivity feature (external dongle or inbuilt) supported by the device (e.g. enabling Wireless-N speeds (up to the maximum supported speed on the wired Ethernet port on both the bridge and connected devices including the wireless access point) for a device which only supports Wireless-G).\nA dual-band wireless bridge can also be used to enable 5&nbsp;GHz wireless network operation on a device which only supports 2.4&nbsp;GHz wireless networking functionality and has a wired Ethernet port.\n\nWireless range-extenders or wireless repeaters can extend the range of an existing wireless network. Strategically placed range-extenders can elongate a signal area or allow for the signal area to reach around barriers such as those pertaining in L-shaped corridors. Wireless devices connected through repeaters will suffer from an increased latency for each hop, as well as from a reduction in the maximum data throughput that is available. In addition, the effect of additional users using a network employing wireless range-extenders is to consume the available bandwidth faster than would be the case where but a single user migrates around a network employing extenders. For this reason, wireless range-extenders work best in networks supporting very low traffic throughput requirements, such as for cases where but a single user with a Wi-Fi equipped tablet migrates around the combined extended and non-extended portions of the total connected network. Additionally, a wireless device connected to any of the repeaters in the chain will have a data throughput that is also limited by the \"weakest link\" existing in the chain between where the connection originates and where the connection ends. Networks employing wireless extenders are also more prone to degradation from interference from neighboring access points that border portions of the extended network and that happen to occupy the same channel as the extended network.\n\nThe security standard, [[Wi-Fi Protected Setup]], allows embedded devices with limited graphical user interface to connect to the Internet with ease. Wi-Fi Protected Setup has 2 configurations: The Push Button configuration and the PIN configuration. These embedded devices are also called The Internet of Things and are low-power, battery-operated embedded systems. A number of Wi-Fi manufacturers design chips and modules for embedded Wi-Fi, such as GainSpan.<ref>GainSpan specifically designs for Wi-Fi technology between Wi-Fi devices. Extremely useful.\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.gainspan.com/technology/technology_overview.php\n|title=GainSpan low-power, embedded Wi-Fi\n|publisher=www.gainspan.com\n|accessdate=2010\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Embedded systems ===\n[[File:Ezurio wism2 small.jpg|thumb|Embedded serial-to-Wi-Fi module]]\nIncreasingly in the last few years (particularly {{As of| 2007 | lc = on}}), embedded Wi-Fi modules have become available that incorporate a real-time operating system and provide a simple means of wirelessly enabling any device which has and communicates via a serial port.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://edageek.com/2008/04/18/embedded-wifi-radio/\n|title=Quatech Rolls Out Airborne Embedded 802.11 Radio for M2M Market\n|accessdate=2008-04-29\n}}</ref>\nThis allows the design of simple monitoring devices.

It makes embedded systems with Wi-Fi connectivity possible to build as single-chip devices, which reduces their cost and minimum size, making it more practical to build wireless-networked controllers into inexpensive ordinary objects.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=November 2015}}\n\n== Range ==\n{{See also|Long-range Wi-Fi}}\nThe Wi-Fi signal range depends on the frequency band, radio power output, antenna gain and antenna type as well as the modulation technique. Line-of-sight is the thumbnail guide but reflection and refraction can have a significant impact.\n\nAn access point compliant with either [[IEEE 802.11#802.11b|802.11b]] or [[IEEE 802.11#802.11g|802.11g]], using the stock antenna might have a range of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The same radio with an external semi parabolic antenna (15&nbsp;dB gain) might have a range over 20 miles.\n\nHigher gain rating (dBi) indicates further deviation (generally toward the horizontal) from a theoretical, perfect [[isotropic radiator]], and therefore the further the antenna can project a usable signal, as compared to a similar output power on a more isotropic antenna.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r15405199-Somebody-explain-dBi|title=Somebody explain dBi \u2013 Wireless Networking \u2013 DSLReports Forums|work=DSL Reports}}</ref> For example, an 8 dBi antenna used with a 100&nbsp;mW driver will have a similar horizontal range to a 6 dBi antenna being driven at 500&nbsp;mW. Note that this assumes that radiation in the vertical is lost; this may not be the case in some situations, especially in large buildings or within a [[waveguide]]. In the above example, a directional waveguide could cause the low power 6 dBi antenna to project much further in a single direction than the 8 dBi antenna which is not in a waveguide, even if they are both being driven at 100&nbsp;mW.\n\n[[IEEE 802.11#802.11n|IEEE 802.11n]], however, can more than double the range.<ref name=wifiplanet>{{cite web|url=http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/3680781 |title=802.11n Delivers Better Range |date=2007-05-31 |work=Wi-Fi Planet |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151108080354/http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/3680781 |archivedate=November 8, 2015 }}</ref> Range also varies with frequency band. Wi-Fi in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz frequency block has slightly better range than Wi-Fi in the 5&nbsp;GHz frequency block used by 802.11a (and optionally by 802.11n). On wireless routers with detachable antennas, it is possible to improve range by fitting upgraded antennas which have higher gain in particular directions. Outdoor ranges can be improved to many kilometers through the use of high gain [[directional antenna]]s at the router and remote device(s). In general, the maximum amount of power that a Wi-Fi device can transmit is limited by local regulations, such as [[Title 47 CFR Part 15|FCC Part 15]] in the US. [[Equivalent isotropically radiated power]] (EIRP) in the European Union is limited to 20 [[dBm]] (100&nbsp;mW).\n\nTo reach requirements for wireless LAN applications, Wi-Fi has fairly high power consumption compared to some other standards. Technologies such as [[Bluetooth]] (designed to support wireless [[personal area network]] (PAN) applications) provide a much shorter [[Radio propagation|propagation]] range between 1 and 100&nbsp;m<ref>[http://janmagnet.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/comparison-ieee-802-standards.pdf] section 1.2 (scope)</ref> and so in general have a lower power consumption. Other low-power technologies such as [[ZigBee]] have fairly long range, but much lower data rate. The high power consumption of Wi-Fi makes battery life in mobile devices a concern.\n\nResearchers have developed a number of \"no new wires\" technologies to provide alternatives to Wi-Fi for applications in which Wi-Fi's indoor range is not adequate and where installing new wires (such as [[Category 6 cable|CAT-6]]) is not possible or cost-effective. For example, the [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] standard for high speed [[local area networks]] uses existing home wiring ([[Ethernet over coax|coaxial cables]], phone lines and [[power line communication|power lines]]). Although [[G.hn]] does not provide some of the advantages of Wi-Fi (such as mobility or outdoor use), it is designed for applications (such as [[IPTV]] distribution) where indoor range is more important than mobility.\n\nFor the best performance, a number of people only recommend using wireless networking as a supplement to wired networking.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Muller|first1=Scott|title=Upgrading and Reparing PCs|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-7897-5610-7|page=898|edition=22nd}}</ref>\n\nDue to the complex nature of [[radio propagation]] at typical Wi-Fi frequencies, particularly the effects of [[signal reflection]] off trees and buildings, algorithms can only approximately predict Wi-Fi signal strength for any given area in relation to a transmitter.<ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://www.alyrica.net/node/20\n|title= WiFi Mapping Software:Footprint\n|publisher=Alyrica Networks\n|accessdate=2008-04-27\n}}</ref>\nThis effect does not apply equally to [[long-range Wi-Fi]], since longer links typically operate from towers that transmit above the surrounding foliage.\n\nThe practical range of Wi-Fi essentially confines mobile use to such applications as inventory-taking machines in warehouses or in retail spaces, [[barcode]]-reading devices at check-out stands, or receiving/shipping stations. {{cit|date=November 2015}} {{dubious |reason=Many other applications exist, such as watching films, editing Wikipedia, writing e-mails. |date=November 2015}} Mobile use of Wi-Fi over wider ranges is limited, for instance, to uses such as in an automobile moving from one hotspot to another. Other wireless technologies are more suitable for communicating with moving vehicles.\n\n;Distance records\nDistance records (using non-standard devices) include {{convert|382|km|mi|abbr=on}} in June 2007, held by Ermanno Pietrosemoli and EsLaRed of Venezuela, transferring about 3&nbsp;MB of data between the mountain-tops of [[Pico El \u00c1guila|El \u00c1guila]] and Platillon.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://interred.wordpress.com/2007/06/18/ermanno-pietrosemoli-has-set-a-new-record-for-the-longest-communication-wi-fi-link/\n|title=Ermanno Pietrosemoli has set a new record for the longest communication Wi-Fi link\n|accessdate=2008-03-10\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.apc.org/en/news/strategic/world/wireless-technology-irreplaceable-providing-access\n|title=Wireless technology is irreplaceable for providing access in remote and scarcely populated regions\n|accessdate=2008-03-10\n}}</ref>\nThe [[Swedish National Space Board|Swedish Space Agency]] transferred data {{convert|420|km|mi|abbr=on}}, using 6 watt amplifiers to reach an overhead stratospheric balloon.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.wifiadvies.be/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/200705_long_distance_wiFi_trial.pdf\n|format=PDF|title=Long Distance WiFi Trial\n|accessdate=2008-03-10\n}}</ref>\n\n== Multiple access points ==\nIncreasing the number of Wi-Fi access points provides network redundancy, better range, support for fast [[roaming]] and increased overall network-capacity by using more channels or by defining smaller [[cellular network|cells]]. Except for the smallest implementations (such as home or small office networks), Wi-Fi implementations have moved toward \"thin\" access points, with more of the [[network intelligence]] housed in a centralized network appliance, relegating individual access points to the role of \"dumb\" transceivers. Outdoor applications may use [[mesh networking|mesh]] topologies.\n\nWhen multiple access points are deployed they are often configured with the same SSID {{clarify|date=November 2015}} and security settings to form an \"extended service set\". Wi-Fi client devices will typically connect to the access point that can provide the strongest signal within that service set.\n\n== Network security ==\n{{Main article|Wireless security}}\nThe main issue with wireless network security is its simplified access to the network compared to traditional wired networks such as [[Ethernet]]. With wired networking, one must either gain access to a building (physically connecting into the internal network), or break through an external [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]]. To enable Wi-Fi, one merely needs to be within the range of the Wi-Fi network. Most business networks protect sensitive data and systems by attempting to disallow external access. Enabling wireless connectivity reduces security if the network uses inadequate or no encryption.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://networkbits.net/wireless-printing/80211-g-pros-cons-of-a-wireless-network-in-a-business-environment/ |title=802.11 X Wireless Network in a Business Environment \u2013 Pros and Cons. |publisher=NetworkBits.net |accessdate=2008-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.app.com/article/20130701/NJNEWS/307010010/Free-Wi-Fi-User-beware-Open-connections-Internet-full-security-dangers|title=Free Wi-Fi?

[[Wi-Fi Protected Access]] (WPA and WPA2) encryption, which became available in devices in 2003, aimed to solve this problem. Wi-Fi [[Wireless access point|access points]] typically default to an encryption-free (''open'') mode. Novice users benefit from a zero-configuration device that works out-of-the-box, but this default does not enable any [[wireless security#Counteracting risks|wireless security]], providing open wireless access to a LAN. To turn security on requires the user to configure the device, usually via a software [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). On unencrypted Wi-Fi networks connecting devices can monitor and record data (including personal information). Such networks can only be secured by using other means of protection, such as a [[virtual private network|VPN]] or secure [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] over [[Transport Layer Security]] ([[HTTP Secure|HTTPS]]).\n\n[[Wi-Fi Protected Access]] encryption (WPA2) is considered secure, provided a strong [[passphrase]] is used. A proposed modification to WPA2 is WPA-OTP or WPA3, which stores an on-chip optically generated [[onetime pad]] on all connected devices which is periodically updated via strong [[encryption]] then hashed with the data to be sent or received.\nThis would be unbreakable using any (even quantum) computer system as the hashed data is essentially random and no pattern can be detected if it is implemented properly.\nMain disadvantage is that it would need multi-GB storage chips so would be expensive for the consumers.\n\n=== Securing methods ===\nA common measure to deter unauthorized users involves hiding the access point's name by disabling the [[Service set (802.11 network)|SSID]] broadcast. While effective against the casual user, it is ineffective as a security method because the SSID is broadcast in the clear in response to a client SSID query. Another method is to only allow computers with known [[MAC address]]es to join the network,<ref>{{cite web\n| url         =http://www.cs.wright.edu/~pmateti/InternetSecurity/Lectures/WirelessHacks/Mateti-WirelessHacks.htm#_Toc77524658\n| title       =Hacking Techniques in Wireless Networks\n| first       =Prabhaker\n| last        =Mateti\n| year        = 2005\n| publisher   =Department of Computer Science and Engineering Wright State University\n| location    =Dayton, Ohio\n| accessdate  = 2010-02-28\n}}</ref>\nbut determined eavesdroppers may be able to join the network by [[MAC spoofing|spoofing]] an authorized address.\n\n[[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP) encryption was designed to protect against casual snooping but it is no longer considered secure. Tools such as [[AirSnort]] or [[Aircrack-ng]] can quickly recover WEP encryption keys.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wireless Vulnerabilities & Exploits|url=http://www.wirelessve.org/entries/show/WVE-2005-0020 |publisher=wirelessve.org|accessdate=2008-04-15}}</ref> Because of WEP's weakness the [[Wi-Fi Alliance]] approved [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]] (WPA) which uses [[Temporal Key Integrity Protocol|TKIP]]. WPA was specifically designed to work with older equipment usually through a firmware upgrade. Though more secure than WEP, WPA has known vulnerabilities.\n\nThe more secure [[WPA2]] using [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] was introduced in 2004 and is supported by most new Wi-Fi devices. WPA2 is fully compatible with WPA.<ref name=\"wpa2-mandatory\">\"WPA2 Security Now Mandatory for Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Products\" {{cite web|work=[[Wi-Fi Alliance]]| url=http://www.wi-fi.org/pressroom_overview.php?newsid=16|title=WPA2 Security Now Mandatory for Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Products}}</ref>\n\nA flaw in a feature added to Wi-Fi in 2007, called [[Wi-Fi Protected Setup]], allows WPA and WPA2 security to be bypassed and effectively broken in many situations. The only remedy as of late 2011 is to turn off Wi-Fi Protected Setup,<ref>http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/723755 [[United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team|US CERT]] Vulnerability Note VU#723755</ref> which is not always possible.\n\n[[Virtual Private Network]]s are often used to secure Wi-Fi.\n\n=== Piggybacking ===\n{{Main article|Piggybacking (Internet access)}}\n{{Further information|Legality of piggybacking}}\n{{Further information|Wi-Fi Protected Setup#Physical security issues}}\nPiggybacking refers to access to a wireless Internet connection by bringing one's own computer within the range of another's wireless connection, and using that service without the subscriber's explicit permission or knowledge.\n\nDuring the early popular adoption of [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]], providing open access points for anyone within range to use was encouraged{{By whom|date=March 2010}} to cultivate [[wireless community network]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nocat.net/ |title=NoCat's goal is to bring you Infinite Bandwidth Everywhere for Free |publisher=Nocat.net |accessdate=2011-10-14}}</ref> particularly since people on average use only a fraction of their downstream bandwidth at any given time.\n\nRecreational logging and mapping of other people's access points has become known as [[wardriving]]. Indeed, many access points are intentionally installed without security turned on so that they can be used as a free service. Providing access to one's Internet connection in this fashion may breach the Terms of Service or contract with the [[Internet service provider|ISP]]. These activities do not result in sanctions in most jurisdictions; however, legislation and [[case law]] differ considerably across the world. A proposal to leave [[graffiti]] describing available services was called [[warchalking]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.blackbeltjones.com/warchalking/warchalking0_9.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=2008-10-09 | title=Let's Warchalk | publisher= Matt Jones}}</ref> A [[Florida]] court case determined that owner laziness was not to be a valid excuse.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nPiggybacking often occurs unintentionally&nbsp;\u2013 a technically unfamiliar user might not change the default \"unsecured\" settings to their access point and operating systems can be configured to connect automatically to any available wireless network. A user who happens to start up a laptop in the vicinity of an access point may find the computer has joined the network without any visible indication. Moreover, a user intending to join one network may instead end up on another one if the latter has a stronger signal. In combination with automatic discovery of other network resources (see [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] and [[Zero configuration networking|Zeroconf]]) this could possibly lead wireless users to send sensitive data to the wrong middle-man when seeking a destination (see [[Man-in-the-middle attack]]). For example, a user could inadvertently use an unsecure network to log in to a [[website]], thereby making the login credentials available to anyone listening, if the website uses an unsecure protocol such as plain [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] without TLS (HTTPS).\n\nAn unauthorized user can obtain security information (factory preset passphrase and/or Wi-Fi Protected Setup PIN) from a label on a wireless access point can use this information (or connect by the Wi-Fi Protected Setup pushbutton method) to commit unauthorized and/or unlawful activities.\n\n== Safety ==\n{{Further information|Wireless electronic devices and health}}\nThe [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) says \"no health effects are expected from exposure to RF fields from base stations and wireless networks\", but notes that they promote research into effects from other RF sources.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs304/en/ \n|title=Electromagnetic fields and public health - Base stations and wireless technologies\n|date=2006 |accessdate=2016-05-28\n|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}</ref> Although the WHO's [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) later classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as \"possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B)\"<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf \n|format=pdf\n|title=IARC Classifies Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields as Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans\n|date=2011 |accessdate=2016-05-28\n|publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer}}</ref> (a category used when \"a causal association is considered credible, but when chance, bias or confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence\"),<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/en\n|title=Electromagnetic Fields and Public Health: Mobile Phones\n|date=October 2014 |accessdate=2016-05-28\n|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}</ref> this was based on risks associated with wireless phone use rather than Wi-Fi networks.\n\nThe United Kingdom's [[Health Protection Agency]] reported in 2007 that exposure to Wi-Fi for a year results in the \"same amount of radiation from a 20-minute mobile phone call\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6677051.stm |title=Q&A: Wi-fi health concerns |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-05-21 |accessdate=2016-05-28}}</ref>\n\nA review of studies involving 725 people who claimed [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]], \"...suggests that 'electromagnetic hypersensitivity' is unrelated to the presence of EMF, although more research into this phenomenon is required.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15784787 |title=\"Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity: A Systematic Review of Provocation Studies \", 2005 |publisher=Psychosomaticmedicine.org |date=2005-03-01 |accessdate=2016-05-28}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Indoor positioning system]]\n* [[Li-Fi]]\n* [[List of WLAN channels]]\n* [[Operating system Wi-Fi support]]\n* [[San Francisco Digital Inclusion Strategy]]\n* [[Super Wi-Fi]] \u2013 IEEE 802.22 proposal to use television bands\n* [[Wi-Fi Alliance]]\n* [[WiGig]]\n* [[Wireless Broadband Alliance]]\n* [[Wireless network interface controller]] (WNIC)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book |last=The WNDW Authors |format=PDF |title=[[:File:Wireless Networking in the Developing World (WNDW) Third Edition.pdf|Wireless Networking in the Developing World (Third Edition)]] |editor-last=Butler |editor-first=Jane |date=1 March 2013 |isbn=978-1-4840-3935-9}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Wiktionary-inline|Wi-Fi}}\n* {{Commons_category-inline}}\n\n{{Internet access}}\n{{Wireless video}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n[[Category:Wi-Fi| ]]\n[[Category:1999 introductions]]\n[[Category:IEEE 802.11]]\n[[Category:Networking standards]]\n[[Category:Wireless networking]]\n[[Category:Australian inventions]]"}]}}}}
