Examples include electronic instruments and motor vehicles.\n\n== Usages ==\n; [[Electronics]] : Most electronics systems have their circuits reference-linked to the chassis while the chassis itself is often, but not always, linked to the Earth.\n; [[Motor vehicle]]s : Most motor vehicles use the chassis as the reference for all electrical peripherals which allow to use only one wire for each accessory.\n\n== Confusion ==\nThe chassis must not be considered as a link to the Earth. Depending on the usage of electrical machines this may, or may not, be the case. For example, in all [[car]]s metallic parts are linked together they are not linked to the Earth<ref>This explain potential electrical discharge when leaving a car.</ref><ref>This article requires several grammatical corrections.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ground (electricity)]]\n\n== Notes and references==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Electric power]]\n[[Category:Electrical safety]]"}]}}}}
