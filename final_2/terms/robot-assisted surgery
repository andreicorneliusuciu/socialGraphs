Robotically-assisted surgery was developed to overcome the limitations of pre-existing [[minimally-invasive procedures|minimally-invasive surgical procedures]] and to enhance the capabilities of surgeons performing open surgery.\n\nIn the case of robotically-assisted minimally-invasive surgery, instead of directly moving the instruments, the surgeon uses one of two methods to control the instruments; either a direct [[Remote manipulator|telemanipulator]] or through computer control. A telemanipulator is a remote manipulator that allows the surgeon to perform the normal movements associated with the surgery whilst the [[robotic arm]]s carry out those movements using [[robot end effector|end-effector]]s and [[manipulator (device)|manipulators]] to perform the actual surgery on the patient. In computer-controlled systems the surgeon uses a computer to control the robotic arms and its end-effectors, though these systems can also still use telemanipulators for their input. One advantage of using the computerised method is that the surgeon does not have to be present, but can be anywhere in the world, leading to the possibility for [[remote surgery]].\n\nIn the case of enhanced open surgery, autonomous instruments (in familiar configurations) replace traditional steel tools, performing certain actions (such as rib spreading) with much smoother, feedback-controlled motions than could be achieved by a human hand. The main object of such smart instruments is to reduce or eliminate the tissue trauma traditionally associated with open surgery without requiring more than a few minutes' training on the part of surgeons. This approach seeks to improve open surgeries, particularly cardio-thoracic, that have so far not benefited from minimally-invasive techniques.\n\nRobotic surgery has been criticized for its expense, by one estimate costing $1,500 to $2000 more per patient.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/health/14robot.html?_r=0.</ref>\n\n== Comparison to traditional methods ==\nMajor advances aided by surgical robots have been [[remote surgery]], [[minimally invasive surgery]] and unmanned surgery. Due to robotic use, the surgery is done with precision, miniaturization, smaller incisions; decreased blood loss, less pain, and quicker healing time. Articulation beyond normal manipulation and three-dimensional magnification helps resulting in improved ergonomics. Due to these techniques there is a reduced duration of hospital stays, blood loss, transfusions, and use of pain medication.<ref name=Estey>{{cite journal|last=Estey|first=EP|date=2009|title=Robotic prostatectomy: The new standard of care or a marketing success?|journal=Canadian Urological Association Journal|volume=3|issue=6|pages=488\u201390|pmc=2792423|pmid=20019980}}</ref>\nThe existing open surgery technique has many flaws like limited access to surgical area, long recovery time, long hours of operation, blood loss, surgical scars and marks.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | doi = 10.1017/S0263574709990658\n| title = A methodology for design and appraisal of surgical robotic systems\n| journal = Robotica\n| volume = 28\n| issue = 2\n| pages = 297\u2013310\n| date = 2009\n| last1 = O'Toole | first1 = M.

As it stands, opinions differ dramatically. Surgeons report that, although the manufacturers of such systems provide training on this new technology, the learning phase is intensive and surgeons must operate on twelve to eighteen patients before they adapt. During the training phase, minimally invasive operations can take up to twice as long as traditional surgery, leading to operating room tie ups and surgical staffs keeping patients under anesthesia for longer periods. Patient surveys indicate they chose the procedure based on expectations of decreased morbidity, improved outcomes, reduced blood loss and less pain.<ref name=Estey/> Higher expectations may explain higher rates of dissatisfaction and regret.<ref name=ORPvsRALRP/>\n\nCompared with other minimally invasive surgery approaches, robot-assisted surgery gives the surgeon better control over the surgical instruments and a better view of the surgical site. In addition, surgeons no longer have to stand throughout the surgery and do not tire as quickly. Naturally occurring hand tremors are filtered out by the robot's computer software. Finally, the surgical robot can continuously be used by rotating surgery teams.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gerhardus|first1=D|date=July\u2013August 2003|title=Robot-assisted surgery: the future is here|journal=Journal of Healthcare Management|volume=48|issue=4|pages=242\u2013251|pmid=12908224}}</ref>\n\nCritics of the system, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,<ref>Breeden, James T., MD, President of ACOG, [http://www.acog.org/About-ACOG/News-Room/News-Releases/2013/Statement-on-Robotic-Surgery] Statement on Robotic Surgery, 14 March 2013</ref> say there is a steep learning curve for surgeons who adopt use of the system and that there's a lack of studies that indicate long-term results are superior to results following traditional [[laparoscopic surgery]].<ref name=kolata>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/health/14robot.html| title=Results Unproven, Robotic Surgery Wins Converts |first=Gina |last=Kolata |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 February 2010 | accessdate=11 March 2010}}</ref> Articles in the newly created ''[[Journal of Robotic Surgery]]'' tend to report on one surgeon's experience.<ref name=kolata/>\n\nA Medicare study found that some procedures that have traditionally been performed with large incisions can be converted to \"minimally invasive\" endoscopic procedures with the use of the [[Da Vinci Surgical System]], shortening length-of-stay in the hospital and reducing recovery times.

Diseases of the Colon and Rectum. December 2004. Volume 47, issue 12, pp. 2162\u20132168</ref><ref>Spinoglio, G. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum. November 2008. Volume 51, issue 11, pp. 1627\u20131632</ref>\n\nResults to date indicate that robotic-assisted colorectal procedures outcomes are \"no worse\" than the results in the now \"traditional\" laparoscopic colorectal operations. Robotic-assisted colorectal surgery appears to be safe as well.<ref>Delaney, C. et al. Diseases of the colon and rectum. December 2003. Volume 46, pp. 1633\u20131639</ref> Most of the procedures have been performed for malignant colon and rectal lesions. However, surgeons are now moving into resections for diverticulitis and non-resective rectopexies (attaching the colon to the sacrum in order to treat rectal prolapse.)\n\nWhen evaluated for several variables, robotic-assisted procedures fare equally well when compared with laparoscopic, or open abdominal operations. Study parameters have looked at intraoperative patient preparation time, length of time to perform the operation, adequacy of the removed surgical specimen with respect to clear surgical margins and number of lymph nodes removed, blood loss, operative or postoperative complications and long-term results.\n\nMore difficult to evaluate are issues related to the view of the operative field, the types of procedures that should be performed using robotic assistance and the potential added cost for a robotic operation.\n\nMany surgeons feel that the optics of the 3-dimensional, two camera stereo optic robotic system are superior to the optical system used in laparoscopic procedures. The pelvic nerves are clearly visualized during robotic-assisted procedures. Less clear however is whether or not these supposedly improved optics and visualization improve patient outcomes with respect to postoperative impotence or incontinence, and whether long-term patient survival is improved by using the 3-dimensional optic system. Additionally, there is often a need for a wider, or \"larger\" view of the operative field than is routinely provided during robotic operations.,<ref>Braumann, C. et al.

On 17 January 2002, surgeons at [[Children's Hospital of Michigan]] in Detroit performed the nation's first advanced computer-assisted robot-enhanced surgical procedure at a children's hospital.\n\nThe Center for Robotic Surgery at [[Children's Hospital Boston]] provides a high level of expertise in pediatric robotic surgery. Specially-trained surgeons use a high-tech robot to perform complex and delicate operations through very small surgical openings. The results are less pain, faster recoveries, shorter hospital stays, smaller scars, and happier patients and families.\n\nIn 2001, Children's Hospital Boston was the first [[pediatrics|pediatric]] hospital to acquire a surgical robot. Today, surgeons use the technology for many procedures and perform more pediatric robotic operations than any other hospital in the world. Children's Hospital physicians have developed a number of new applications to expand the use of the robot, and train surgeons from around the world on its use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.childrenshospital.org/robotics |publisher=Children's Hospital Center |title=Robotic Surgery |accessdate=29 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416210715/http://www.childrenshospital.org/robotics |archivedate=16 April 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Radiosurgery===\nThe [[CyberKnife]] Robotic [[Radiosurgery]] System uses image guidance and computer controlled robotics to treat tumors throughout the body by delivering multiple beams of high-energy radiation to the tumor from virtually any direction. The system uses a German [[KUKA]] KR 240. Mounted on the robot is a compact X-band [[linac]] that produces 6MV X-ray radiation. Mounting the radiation source on the robot allows very fast repositioning of the source, which enables the system to deliver radiation from many different directions without the need to move both the patient and source as required by current gantry configurations.\n\n===Transplant surgery===\nTransplant surgery ([[organ transplantation]]) has been considered as highly technically demanding and virtually unobtainable by means of conventional laparoscopy. For many years, transplant patients were unable to benefit from the advantages of minimally invasive surgery. The development of robotic technology and its associated high resolution capabilities, three dimensional visual system, wrist type motion and fine instruments, gave opportunity for highly complex procedures to be completed in a minimally invasive fashion. Subsequently, the first fully robotic kidney transplantations were performed in the late 2000s. After the procedure was proven to be feasible and safe, the main emerging challenge was to determine which patients would benefit most from this robotic technique. As a result, recognition of the increasing prevalence of obesity amongst patients with kidney failure on hemodialysis posed a significant problem. Due to the abundantly higher risk of complications after traditional open kidney transplantation, obese patients were frequently denied access to transplantation, which is the premium treatment for end stage kidney disease. The use of the robotic-assisted approach has allowed kidneys to be transplanted with minimal incisions, which has virtually alleviated wound complications and significantly shortened the recovery period. The [[University of Illinois Medical Center]] reported the largest series of 104 robotic-assisted kidney transplants for obese recipients (mean [[body mass index]] > 42). Amongst this group of patients, no wound infections were observed and the function of transplanted kidneys was excellent. In this way, robotic kidney transplantation could be considered as the biggest advance in surgical technique for this procedure since its creation more than half a century ago.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Giulianotti PC, Gorodner V, Sbrana F, Tzvetanov I, Jeon H, Bianco F, Kinzer K, Oberholzer J, Benedetti E | year = 2010 | title = Robotic Trans-Abdominal Kidney Transplantation in a Morbidly Obese Patient | url = | journal = AJT | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 1\u20135 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Oberholzer J, Giulianotti P, Danielson KK, Spaggiari M, Bejarano-Pineda L, Bianco F, Tzvetanov I, Ayloo S, Jeon H, Garcia-Roca R, Thielke J, Tang I, Akkina S, Becker B, Kinzer K, Patel A, Benedetti E | year = 2013 | title = Minimally invasive robotic kidney transplantation for obese patients previously denied access to transplantation | url = | journal = American Journal of Transplantation | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 721\u20138 | doi = 10.1111/ajt.12078 | pmid = 23437881 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tzvetanov I, Giulianotti PC, Bejarano-Pineda L, Jeon H, Garcia-Roca R, Bianco F, Oberholzer J, Benedetti E | date = December 2013 | title = Robotic-assisted kidney transplantation | url = | journal = Surg Clin North Am. | volume = 93 | issue = 6| pages = 1309\u201323 | doi = 10.1016/j.suc.2013.08.003 }}</ref>\n\n===Urology===\nRobotic surgery in the field of urology has become very popular, especially in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = DI | title = Robotic prostatectomy: what we have learned and where we are going | journal = Yonsei Med J | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages = 177\u201381 |date=April 2009 | doi = 10.3349/ymj.2009.50.2.177 | pmid = 19430547 | pmc=2678689}}</ref> It has been most extensively applied for excision of prostate cancer because of difficult anatomical access.

Over 60 [[Arthroscopy|arthroscopic]] surgical procedures were performed in the first 12 months, and a 1985 [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] video on industrial robots, ''The Robotics Revolution'', featured the device. Other related robotic devices developed at the same time included a surgical [[scrub nurse]] robot, which handed operative instruments on voice command, and a medical laboratory robotic arm. A YouTube video entitled ''Arthrobot'' illustrates some of these in operation.\n\nIn 1985 a robot, the [[Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly|Unimation Puma 200]], was used to place a needle for a brain biopsy using CT guidance.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kwoh, Y.

Just like with any other technological innovation, this system led to the development of new and improved surgical robot called PROBOT.

The da Vinci senses the surgeon's hand movements and translates them electronically into scaled-down micro-movements to manipulate the tiny proprietary instruments. It also detects and filters out any tremors in the surgeon's hand movements, so that they are not duplicated robotically.
