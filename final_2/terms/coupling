This one is used to cancel out misalignment and vibrations.]]\nA '''coupling''' is a device used to connect two shafts together at their ends for the purpose of transmitting power. Couplings do not normally allow disconnection of shafts during operation, however there are [[torque limiter|torque limiting]] couplings which can slip or disconnect when some torque limit is exceeded.\n\nThe primary purpose of couplings is to join two pieces of rotating equipment while permitting some degree of misalignment or end movement or both. By careful selection, installation and maintenance of couplings, substantial savings can be made in reduced maintenance costs and downtime.\n\n==Uses==\nShaft couplings are used in machinery for several purposes. \nThe most common of which are the following.\n\n* To transfer power one end to another end.(ex: motor transfer power to pump through coupling) Primary function.\n* To provide for the connection of shafts of units that are manufactured separately such as a motor and generator and to provide for disconnection for repairs or alterations.\n* To provide for misalignment of the shafts or to introduce mechanical flexibility.\n* To reduce the transmission of shock loads from one shaft to another.\n* To introduce protection against overloads.\n* To alter the vibration characteristics of rotating units.\n* To connect driving and the driven part\n*slips when overload occurs\n\n==Types==\n\nClamped or compression rigid couplings come in two parts and fit together around the shafts to form a sleeve. They offer more flexibility than sleeved models, and can be used on shafts that are fixed in place. They generally are large enough so that screws can pass all the way through the coupling and into the second half to ensure a secure hold.Flanged rigid couplings are designed for heavy loads or industrial equipment. They consist of short sleeves surrounded by a perpendicular flange. One coupling is placed on each shaft so the two flanges line up face to face. A series of screws or bolts can then be installed in the flanges to hold them together. Because of their size and durability, flanged units can be used to bring shafts into alignment before they are joined together.\nRigid couplings are used when precise shaft alignment is required; shaft misalignment will affect the coupling's performance as well as its life. Examples:\n\n===Sleeve or Muff coupling===\n\nA [[sleeve coupling]] consists of a [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]] whose [[Bore (engine)|bore]] is finished to the required tolerance based on the shaft size. Based on the usage of the coupling a [[Keyway (engineering)|keyway]] is made in the bore in order to transmit the [[torque]] by means of the key. Two threaded holes are provided in order to lock the coupling in position.\n\nSleeve couplings are also known as '''Box Couplings'''. In this case shaft ends are coupled together and abutted against each other which are enveloped by ''muff'' or ''sleeve''. A gib head sunk keys hold the two shafts and sleeve together.\nin other words,\nthis is the simplest type of the coupling. It is made from the cast iron and very simple to design and manufacture. It consists of a hollow pipe whose inner diameter is same as diameter of the shafts.\nThe hollow pipe is fitted over a two or more ends of the shafts with the help of the taper sunk key.a key and sleeve are useful to transmit power from one shaft to another shaft.\n\n===Clamp or Split-muff coupling===\n\nIn this coupling, the muff or sleeve is made into two halves parts of the cast iron and they are joined together by means of mild steel studs or bolts. The advantages of this coupling is that assembling or disassembling of the coupling is possible without changing the position of the shaft. This coupling is used for heavy power transmission at moderate speed.\n\n===Tapered shaft lock===\n\nA '''tapered lock''' is a form of [[Key (engineering)|key]]less shaft locking device<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lovejoy-inc.com/products/shaft-locking-devices.aspx|title=Lovejoy, Inc. : Products : Couplings & Power Transmission: Shaft Locking Devices|publisher=Lovejoy-inc.com|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref> that does not require any material to be removed from the shaft. The basic idea is similar to a clamp coupling but the moment of rotation is closer to the center of the shaft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ustsubaki.com/pdf/l0930000_power_lock_catalog.pdf|format=PDF|title=U.S. Tsubaki POWER-LOCK Catalog|publisher=Ustsubaki.com|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref> An alternative [[Coupling#Others|coupling device]] to the traditional [[Key (engineering)#Parallel keys|parallel key]], the tapered lock removes the possibility of [[Backlash (engineering)|play]] due to worn keyways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tsubakimoto.com/mining-industry/power-lock|title=Power Lock|publisher=Tsubakimoto.com|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.fennerdrives.com/catalogs/keyless_bushings.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904160139/http://www.fennerdrives.com/catalogs/keyless_bushings.pdf |date=September 4, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tsubakimoto.com/power-transmission/shaft-coupling/disc/echt-flex/nef-taper-lock|title=NEF Taper-Lock Series|publisher=Tsubakimoto.com|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref> It is more robust than using a key because maintenance only requires one tool and the self-centering balanced rotation means it lasts longer than a keyed joint would, but the downside is that it costs more.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Hirth===\n\n{{Main article|Hirth joint}}\nHirth joints use tapered teeth on two shaft ends meshed together to transmit torque.\n\n===Flexible===\nFlexible couplings are used to transmit [[torque]] from one shaft to another when the two shafts are slightly misaligned. Flexible couplings can accommodate varying degrees of misalignment up to 3\u00b0 and some parallel misalignment. In addition, they can also be used for vibration damping or noise reduction.This coupling is used to protect the driving and driven shaft members against harmful effects produced due to misalignment of the shafts, sudden shock loads, shaft expansion or vibrations etc.\n\n====Bush pin type flange coupling====\nThis is used for slightly imperfect alignment of the two shafts.\n\nThis is modified form of the protected type flange coupling. This type of coupling has pins and it works with coupling bolts. The rubber or leather bushes are used over the pins. The coupling has two halves dissimilar in construction. The pins are rigidly fastened by nuts to one of the flange and kept loose on the other flange. This coupling is used to connect of shafts which having a small parallel misalignment, angular misalignment or axial misalignment. In this coupling the rubber bushing absorbs shocks and vibration during its operations. This type of coupling is mostly used to couple electric motors and machines.\n\n====Beam Coupling====\n[[File:Beam Coupling - Helical Standard.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A beam coupling]]\nA ''beam'' coupling, also known as ''helical'' coupling, is a flexible coupling for transmitting torque between two shafts while allowing for angular misalignment, parallel offset and even axial motion, of one shaft relative to the other.  This design utilizes a single piece of material and becomes flexible by removal of material along a spiral path resulting in a curved flexible beam of helical shape.  Since it is made from a single piece of material, the Beam Style coupling does not exhibit the [[Backlash (engineering)|backlash]] found in some multi-piece couplings.  Another advantage of being an all machined coupling is the possibility to incorporate features into the final product while still keep the single piece integrity.\n\nChanges to the lead of the helical beam provide changes to misalignment capabilities as well as other performance characteristics such as torque capacity and torsional stiffness.  It is even possible to have multiple starts within the same helix.\n\nThe material used to manufacture the beam coupling also affects its performance and suitability for specific applications such as food, medical and aerospace.  Materials are typically aluminum alloy and stainless steel, but they can also be made in [[polyoxymethylene|acetal]], [[maraging steel]] and [[titanium]].  The most common applications are attaching [[rotary encoder]]s to shafts and motion control for [[robotics]].\n{{clear}}\n<gallery>\nFile:Special Beam Couplings with attachments.jpg|A beam coupling with optional features machined into it\nFile:Helical U-Joint (Beam Style Coupling) - Angular Misalignment.jpg|Increasing number of coils allows for greater angular misalignment\n</gallery>\n\n====Constant velocity====\n{{Main article|Constant-velocity joint}}\nThere are various types of constant-velocity (CV) couplings: [[Constant-velocity joint#Rzeppa joints|Rzeppa joint]], [[Constant-velocity joint#Double Cardan|Double cardan]] joint, and [[Thompson coupling]].\n\n====Diaphragm====\nDiaphragm couplings transmit torque from the outside diameter of a flexible plate to the inside diameter, across the spool or spacer piece, and then from inside to outside diameter. The deforming of a plate or series of plates from I.D. to O.D accomplishes the misalignment.\n\n====Disc====\n{{Main article|Disc coupling}}\nDisc couplings transmit torque from a driving to a driven bolt tangentially on a common bolt circle. Torque is transmitted between the bolts through a series of thin, stainless steel discs assembled in a pack. Misalignment is accomplished by deforming of the material between the bolts.\n\n====Fluid====\n{{Main article|Fluid coupling}}\n\n====Gear====\n[[Image:Gear coupling.png|thumb|left|150px|A gear coupling]]\n\nA ''gear coupling'' is a mechanical device for transmitting [[torque]] between two shafts that are not [[Line (geometry)|collinear]]. It consists of a flexible joint fixed to each shaft. The two joints are connected by a third shaft, called the spindle.\n\nEach joint consists of a 1:1 [[gear ratio]] internal/external [[gear]] pair. The tooth flanks and outer diameter of the external gear are crowned to allow for [[angular displacement]] between the two gears.  Mechanically, the gears are equivalent to [[rotating spline]]s with modified profiles. They are called gears because of the relatively large size of the teeth.\n\nGear couplings and [[universal joint]]s are used in similar applications. Gear couplings have higher [[torque density|torque densities]] than universal joints designed to fit a given space while universal joints induce lower [[vibration]]s. The limit on torque density in universal joints is due to the limited [[cross section (geometry)|cross sections]] of the cross and yoke. The gear teeth in a gear coupling have high [[backlash (gear)|backlash]] to allow for angular misalignment. The excess backlash can contribute to vibration.\n\nGear couplings are generally limited to angular misalignments, i.e., the angle of the spindle relative to the axes of the connected shafts, of 4-5\u00b0.  Universal joints are capable of higher misalignments.\n\nSingle joint gear couplings are also used to connect two nominally coaxial shafts. In this application the device is called a gear-type flexible, or [[flexible coupling]]. The single joint allows for minor misalignments such as installation errors and changes in shaft alignment due to operating conditions.  These types of gear couplings are generally limited to angular misalignments of 1/4-1/2\u00b0.\n\n====Grid====\nA ''grid coupling'' is composed of two shaft hubs, a metallic grid spring, and a split cover kit. Torque is transmitted between the two coupling shaft hubs through the metallic grid spring element.\n\nLike metallic gear and disc couplings, grid couplings have a high [[torque density]]. A benefit of grid couplings, over either gear or disc couplings, is the ability their grid coupling spring elements have to absorb and spread peak load impact energy over time. This reduces the magnitude of peak loads and offers some vibration dampening capability. A negative of the grid coupling design is that it generally is very limited in its ability to accommodate the misalignment.<ref>{{cite web|title = Why a Grid Coupling - Features & Benefits, Design Basics, and Element Options|url = http://www.couplinganswers.com/2014/12/why-grid-coupling-features-benefits.html |publisher=Couplinganswers.com |accessdate = 2014-12-22}}</ref>\n\n====Oldham====\n[[Image:Oldham coupler animated small.gif|thumb|left|150px|Animated Oldham coupler]]\n\nAn ''Oldham coupling'' has three discs, one coupled to the input, one coupled to the output, and a middle disc that is joined to the first two by [[tongue and groove]].  The tongue and groove on one side is perpendicular to the tongue and groove on the other. The middle disc rotates around its center at the same speed as the input and output shafts.  Its center traces a circular orbit, twice per rotation, around the midpoint between input and output shafts. Often [[Spring (device)|spring]]s are used to reduce [[Backlash (engineering)|backlash]] of the mechanism. An advantage to this type of coupling, as compared to two universal joints, is its compact size. The coupler is named for [[John Oldham (engineer)|John Oldham]] who invented it in [[Ireland]], in 1821, to solve a problem in a [[paddle steamer]] design.\n\n{{clear}}\n<gallery>\nImage:Klauenkupplung 1.jpg|Oldham coupler, assembled\nImage:Klauenkupplung 3.jpg|Oldham coupler, disassembled\n</gallery>\n\n====Rag joint====\n{{Main article|Rag joint}}\n\nRag joints are commonly used on automotive [[steering]] linkages and [[drive train]]s. When used on a drive train they are sometimes known as [[giubo]]s.\n\n====Universal joint====\n{{Main article|Universal joint}}\n\n====Magnetic Coupling====\n{{Main article|Magnetic coupling}}\nA magnetic coupling uses magnetic forces to transmit the power from one shaft to the other without any contact, this allows for full medium separation.\nTherefore can provide the ability to hermetically separate two areas whilst continuing to transmit mechanical power from one to the other making these couplings ideal for applications where prevention of cross contamination is essential.\n\n====Others====\n* Bellows coupling \u2014 low backlash\n* Elastomeric coupling\n** Bushed pin coupling\n** Donut coupling\n** Spider or [[jaw coupling]] (or Lovejoy\u00ae coupling)\n* [[Geislinger coupling]]\n* Resilient coupling\n* Roller chain and sprocket coupling\n* [[Schmidt coupling]]\n\n==Requirements of good shaft alignment / good coupling set up==\n{{main article|Shaft alignment}}\n*It should be easy to connect or disconnect the coupling.\n*It does allow some misalignment between the two adjacent shaft rotation axes.\n*Its goal should be to minimise the remaining misalignment in running operation so as to maximise power transmission and to maximise machine runtime (coupling, bearing and sealing's lifetime).\n*It should have no projecting parts.\n*It is recommended to use manufacturer's alignment target values to set up the machine train to a defined non-zero alignment, due to the fact that later, when the machine is at operation temperature, the alignment condition is perfect\n\n==Coupling maintenance and failure==\nCoupling maintenance is generally a simple matter, requiring a regularly scheduled inspection of each coupling. It consists of:\n* Performing visual inspections, checking for signs of wear or fatigue, and cleaning couplings regularly.\n* Checking and changing lubricant regularly if the coupling is lubricated. This maintenance is required annually for most couplings and more frequently for couplings in adverse environments or in demanding operating conditions.\n* Documenting the maintenance performed on each coupling, along with the date.<ref name=PlantServices>{{cite web|author=Boyle, B.|date=2008|title=Tracking the causes of coupling failure|url=http://www.plantservices.com/articles/2008/197.html|quote=Explore coupling maintenance and the telltale signs of failure to maximize coupling life and ensure reliable system operations|publisher=Plantservices.com|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nEven with proper maintenance, however, couplings can fail. Underlying reasons for failure, other than maintenance, include:\n* Improper installation\n* Poor coupling selection\n* Operation beyond design capabilities.<ref name=\"PlantServices\" />\n\nThe only way to improve coupling life is to understand what caused the failure and to correct it prior to installing a new coupling.\nSome external signs that indicate potential coupling failure include:\n* Abnormal noise, such as screeching, squealing or chattering\n* Excessive vibration or wobble\n* Failed seals indicated by lubricant leakage or contamination.<ref name=\"PlantServices\" />\n\n==Checking the coupling balance==\nCouplings are normally balanced at the factory prior to being shipped, but they occasionally go out of balance in operation. Balancing can be difficult and expensive, and is normally done only when operating tolerances are such that the effort and the expense are justified. The amount of coupling unbalance that can be tolerated by any system is dictated by the characteristics of the specific connected machines and can be determined by detailed analysis or experience.<ref name=\"PlantServices\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Clutch]]\n*[[Railway coupling]]\n*[[Linkage (mechanical)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Oldham couplings}}\n*[http://kmoddl.library.cornell.edu/biographies/Oldham/index.php Biography of Oldham at Cornell University]\n*[[Yutaka Nishiyama]], [http://ijpam.eu/contents/2012-81-1/8/8.pdf From Oldham's Coupling to Air Conditioners]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Rotating shaft couplings| ]]\n[[Category:Mechanisms (engineering)]]\n[[Category:Hardware (mechanical)]]\n[[Category:Mechanical engineering]]"}]}}}}
