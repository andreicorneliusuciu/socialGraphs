This broad definition includes [[turbojet]]s, [[turbofan]]s, [[rocket engine]]s, [[ramjet]]s, and [[pulse jet engine|pulse jets]]. In general, jet engines are combustion engines.\n\nIn common parlance, the term ''[[wiktionary:jet engine|jet engine]]'' loosely refers to an [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]] [[airbreathing jet engine]]. These typically feature a [[Axial compressor|rotating air compressor]] powered by a [[turbine]], with the leftover power providing thrust via a [[propelling nozzle]] \u2014 this process is known as the [[Brayton cycle|Brayton thermodynamic cycle]]. [[Jet aircraft]] use such engines for long-distance travel. Early jet aircraft used turbojet engines which were relatively inefficient for subsonic flight. Modern subsonic jet aircraft usually use more complex [[High-bypass turbofan|high-bypass turbofan engines]].  These engines offer high speed and greater fuel efficiency than piston and propeller aeroengines over long distances.\n\nThe [[thrust]] of a typical [[jetliner]] engine went from {{convert|5000|lbf|abbr=on}} ([[de Havilland Ghost]] turbojet ) in the 1950s to {{convert|115,000 |lbf|abbr=on}} ([[General Electric GE90]] turbofan) in the 1990s, and their reliability went from 40 in-flight shutdowns per 100,000 engine flight hours to less than one in the late 1990s. This, combined with greatly decreased fuel consumption, permitted routine [[ETOPS|transatlantic flight by twin-engined airliners]] by the turn of the century, where before a similar journey would have required multiple fuel stops.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.airbus.com/fileadmin/media_gallery/files/safety_library_items/AirbusSafetyLib_-FLT_OPS-SUPP_TECH-SEQ07.pdf |title= Flight Operations Briefing Notes - Supplementary Techniques : Handling Engine Malfunctions |publisher= Airbus}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of the jet engine}}\n{{See also|Timeline of jet power}}\nJet engines date back to the invention of the [[aeolipile]] before the first century AD. This device directed steam power through two nozzles to cause a sphere to spin rapidly on its axis. So far as is known, it did not supply mechanical power and the potential practical applications of this invention did not receive recognition. Instead, it was seen as a curiosity.\n\nJet propulsion only gained practical applications with the invention of the [[gunpowder]]-powered [[rocket]] by the Chinese in the 13th century as a type of [[fireworks|firework]], and gradually progressed to propel formidable weaponry. However, although very powerful, at reasonable flight speeds rockets are very inefficient and so jet propulsion technology stalled for hundreds of years.\n\nThe earliest attempts at airbreathing jet engines were hybrid designs in which an external power source first compressed air, which was then mixed with fuel and burned for jet thrust. In one such system, called a ''thermojet'' by [[Secondo Campini]] but more commonly, [[motorjet]], the air was compressed by a fan driven by a conventional piston engine. Examples of this type of design were the [[Caproni Campini N.1]], and the Japanese [[Tsu-11]] engine intended to power [[Ohka]] [[kamikaze]] planes towards the end of [[World War II]]. None were entirely successful and the N.1 ended up being slower than the same design with a traditional engine and [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] combination.\n[[Image:Albert Fono's ramjet-cannonball in 1915.png|thumb|left|[[Albert Fon\u00f3]]'s [[ramjet]]-cannonball from 1915]]\n\nEven before the start of World War II, engineers were beginning to realize that engines driving propellers were self-limiting in terms of the maximum performance which could be attained; the limit was due to issues related to propeller efficiency,<ref>[http://selair.selkirk.bc.ca/aerodynamics1/Performance/Page8.html propeller efficiency] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525093007/http://selair.selkirk.bc.ca/aerodynamics1/Performance/Page8.html |date=May 25, 2008 }}</ref> which declined as blade tips approached the [[speed of sound]]. If aircraft performance were ever to increase beyond such a barrier, a way would have to be found to use a different propulsion mechanism. This was the motivation behind the development of the gas turbine engine, commonly called a \"jet\" engine.\n\nThe key to a practical jet engine was the gas turbine, used to extract energy from the engine itself to drive the [[gas compressor|compressor]]. The [[gas turbine]] was not an idea developed in the 1930s: the patent for a stationary turbine was granted to John Barber in England in 1791. The first gas turbine to successfully run self-sustaining was built in 1903 by Norwegian engineer [[\u00c6gidius Elling]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1636804|title=Centenary of the First Gas Turbine to Give Net Power Output: A Tribute to \u00c6gidius Elling|journal=The American Society of Mechanical Engineers|date=14 June 2004|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref> Limitations in design and practical engineering and [[metallurgy]] prevented such engines reaching manufacture. The main problems were safety, reliability, weight and, especially, sustained operation.\n\nThe first patent for using a gas turbine to power an aircraft was filed in 1921 by Frenchman [[Maxime Guillaume]].<ref>Maxime Guillaume, \"Propulseur par r\u00e9action sur l'air,\" French patent no. 534,801 (filed: 3 May 1921; issued: 13 January 1922).

In October 1929 he developed his ideas further.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/whittle_frank.shtml |title=History - Frank Whittle (1907 - 1996) |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref> On 16 January 1930 in England, Whittle submitted his first patent (granted in 1932).<ref>Frank Whittle, \"Improvements relating to the propulsion of aircraft and other vehicles,\" British patent no. 347,206 (filed: 16 January 1930).

Practical axial compressors were made possible by ideas from [[Alan Arnold Griffith|A.A.Griffith]] in a seminal paper in 1926 (\"An Aerodynamic Theory of Turbine Design\"). Whittle would later concentrate on the simpler centrifugal compressor only, for a variety of practical reasons. Whittle had his first engine running in April 1937. It was liquid-fuelled, and included a self-contained fuel pump. Whittle's team experienced near-panic when the engine would not stop, accelerating even after the fuel was switched off. It turned out that fuel had leaked into the engine and accumulated in pools, so the engine would not stop until all the leaked fuel had burned off. Whittle was unable to interest the government in his invention, and development continued at a slow pace.\n\n[[Image:Ohain USAF He 178 page61.jpg|thumb|left|[[Heinkel He 178]], the world's first aircraft to fly purely on turbojet power]]\nIn 1935 [[Hans von Ohain]] started work on a similar design in [[Germany]], initially unaware of Whittle's work.<ref>[http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/bljetengine.htm The History of the Jet Engine - Sir Frank Whittle - Hans Von Ohain<!-- Bot generated title -->] Ohain said that he had not read Whittle's patent and Whittle believed him. ([http://www.solarnavigator.net/inventors/frank_whittle.htm Frank Whittle 1907-1996]).</ref>\n\nVon Ohain's first device was strictly experimental and could run only under external power, but he was able to demonstrate the basic concept. Ohain was then introduced to [[Ernst Heinkel]], one of the larger aircraft industrialists of the day, who immediately saw the promise of the design. Heinkel had recently purchased the Hirth engine company, and Ohain and his master machinist [[Max Hahn]] were set up there as a new division of the Hirth company. They had their first [[Heinkel HeS 1|HeS 1]] centrifugal engine running by September 1937. Unlike Whittle's design, Ohain used [[hydrogen]] as fuel, supplied under external pressure. Their subsequent designs culminated in the [[gasoline]]-fuelled [[Heinkel HeS 3|HeS 3]] of {{convert|5|kN|lbf|abbr=on}}, which was fitted to Heinkel's simple and compact [[Heinkel He 178|He 178]] airframe and flown by [[Erich Warsitz]] in the early morning of August 27, 1939, from [[Rostock]]-Marienehe [[aerodrome]], an impressively short time for development. The He 178 was the world's first jet plane.<ref>Warsitz, Lutz: [http://www.pen-and-sword.co.uk/?product_id=1762 ''THE FIRST JET PILOT - The Story of German Test Pilot Erich Warsitz'' (p. 125), Pen and Sword Books Ltd., England, 2009]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Junkers Jumo 004.jpg|thumb|A cutaway of the Junkers Jumo 004 engine]]\n[[Austria]]n [[Anselm Franz]] of [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]]' engine division (''Junkers Motoren'' or \"Jumo\") introduced the [[axial-flow compressor]] in their jet engine. Jumo was assigned the next engine number in the [[Reich Air Ministry|RLM]] 109-0xx numbering sequence for gas turbine aircraft powerplants, \"004\", and the result was the [[Junkers Jumo 004|Jumo 004]] engine. After many lesser technical difficulties were solved, mass production of this engine started in 1944 as a powerplant for the world's first jet-[[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] aircraft, the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] (and later the world's first jet-[[bomber]] aircraft, the [[Arado Ar 234]]). A variety of reasons conspired to delay the engine's availability, causing the fighter to arrive too late to improve Germany's position in [[World War II]], however this was the first jet engine to be used in service.\n\nMeanwhile, in Britain the [[Gloster E28/39]] had its maiden flight on 15 May 1941 and the [[Gloster Meteor]] finally entered service with the [[RAF]] in July 1944. These were powered by turbojet engines from Power Jets Ltd., set up by Frank Whittle.\n\nFollowing the end of the war the German jet aircraft and jet engines were extensively studied by the victorious allies and contributed to work on early [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and US jet fighters. The legacy of the axial-flow engine is seen in the fact that practically all jet engines on [[fixed-wing aircraft]] have had some inspiration from this design.\n\nBy the 1950s the jet engine was almost universal in combat aircraft, with the exception of cargo, liaison and other specialty types. By this point some of the British designs were already cleared for civilian use, and had appeared on early models like the [[de Havilland Comet]] and [[Avro Canada Jetliner]]. By the 1960s all large civilian aircraft were also jet powered, leaving the [[Reciprocating engine|piston engine]] in low-cost niche roles such as [[cargo]] flights.\n\nThe efficiency of turbojet engines was still rather worse than piston engines, but by the 1970s, with the advent of [[High-bypass turbofan engine|high-bypass turbofan jet engines]] (an innovation not foreseen by the early commentators such as [[Edgar Buckingham]], at high speeds and high altitudes that seemed absurd to them), fuel efficiency was about the same as the best piston and propeller engines.<ref name=hist8>{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-468/ch10-3.htm |title=ch10-3 |publisher=Hq.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:JT9D on 747.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Pratt & Whitney JT9D|JT9D]] turbofan jet engine installed on a [[Boeing 747]] aircraft.]]\nJet engines power [[jet aircraft]], [[cruise missile]]s and [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s. In the form of [[rocket engine]]s they power [[fireworks]], [[model rocketry]], [[spaceflight]], and military [[missile]]s.\n\nJet engines have propelled high speed cars, particularly [[drag racer]]s, with the all-time record held by a [[rocket car]]. A turbofan powered car, [[ThrustSSC]], currently holds the [[land speed record]].\n\nJet engine designs are frequently modified for non-aircraft applications, as [[Gas turbine|industrial gas turbines]] or [[Marine engine|marine powerplants]]. These are used in electrical power generation, for powering water, natural gas, or oil pumps, and providing propulsion for ships and locomotives. Industrial gas turbines can create up to 50,000 shaft horsepower. Many of these engines are derived from older military turbojets such as the Pratt & Whitney J57 and J75 models. There is also a derivative of the P&W JT8D low-bypass turbofan that creates up to 35,000 HP.\n\nJet engines are also sometimes developed into, or share certain components such as engine cores, with [[turboshaft]] and [[turboprop]] engines, which are forms of gas turbine engines that are typically used to power [[helicopter]]s and some propeller-driven aircraft..\n\n==Types==\nThere are a large number of different types of jet engines, all of which achieve forward thrust from the principle of ''jet propulsion''.\n\n===Airbreathing===\n{{Main article|Airbreathing jet engine}}\nCommonly aircraft are propelled by airbreathing jet engines. Most airbreathing jet engines that are in use are [[turbofan]] jet engines, which give good efficiency at speeds just below the speed of sound.\n\n====Turbine powered====\n{{Main article|Gas turbine}}\n[[Gas turbines]] are rotary engines that extract energy from a flow of combustion gas. They have an upstream compressor coupled to a downstream turbine with a combustion chamber in-between. In aircraft engines, those three core components are often called the \"gas generator.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Mattingly|first1=Jack D.|title=Elements of Propulsion: Gas Turbines and Rockets|series=AIAA Education Series|year=2006|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|location=Reston, VA |page=6|isbn=1-56347-779-3}}</ref> There are many different variations of gas turbines, but they all use a gas generator system of some type.\n\n=====Turbojet=====\n{{Main article|Turbojet}}\n[[File:Jet engine.svg|thumb|right|Turbojet engine]]\nA [[turbojet]] engine is a [[gas turbine]] engine that works by compressing air with an inlet and a compressor ([[Axial compressor|axial]], [[Centrifugal compressor|centrifugal]], or both), mixing fuel with the compressed air, burning the mixture in the [[combustor]], and then passing the hot, high pressure air through a [[turbine]] and a [[propelling nozzle|nozzle]]. The compressor is powered by the turbine, which extracts energy from the expanding gas passing through it. The engine converts internal energy in the fuel to kinetic energy in the exhaust, producing thrust. All the air ingested by the inlet is passed through the compressor, combustor, and turbine, unlike the [[turbofan]] engine described below.<ref>Mattingly, pp. 6-8</ref>\n\n=====Turbofan=====\n[[File:Turbofan operation lbp.svg|thumb|right|Schematic diagram illustrating the operation of a low-bypass turbofan engine.]]\n{{Main article|Turbofan}}\n[[Turbofan]]s differ from turbojets in that they have an additional fan at the front of the engine, which accelerates air in a duct bypassing the core gas turbine engine. Compared to a turbojet of identical thrust, a turbofan has a much larger air mass flow rate. Turbofans are the dominant engine type for medium and long-range [[airliner]]s.\n\nThe comparatively large frontal fan has several effects. The main effect is that the output of the engine as a whole has a much higher mass per second, and therefore generates much more thrust, despite not having ignited much of its airflow. Also, because the additional air has not been ignited, no extra fuel is needed to provide this thrust. The slower average velocity of the mixed exhaust air (low [[specific thrust]]) is also less wasteful of energy for subsonic flight, and allows the engine to be more efficient and much quieter, while the fan also allows greater thrust to be available at slow speeds. Together, the thrust produced by the fan and core are much more fuel efficient, and provides a much higher output, than could be produced by the core alone.\n\nTurbofans are usually more efficient than turbojets at subsonic speeds, but their large frontal area also generates more [[drag]].<ref>Mattingly, pp. 9-11</ref> Therefore, in supersonic flight, and in military and other aircraft where absolute performance, weight, and drag have a higher priority than fuel efficiency, engines tend to either have smaller fans (or multiple smaller fans) or use other engine designs entirely.  Typically, turbofans in civilian aircraft usually have a pronounced large front area to accommodate a very large fan, as their design involves a much larger mass of air bypassing the core so they can benefit from these effects, while in [[military aircraft]], where noise and efficiency are less important compared to performance and drag, a smaller amount of air typically bypasses the core. Turbofans designed for subsonic civilian aircraft also usually have a just a single front fan, because their additional thrust is generated by a large additional mass of air which is only moderately compressed, rather than a smaller amount of air which is greatly compressed.\n\nBecause of these distinctions, turbofan engine designs are often categorized as [[Low-bypass turbofan|low-bypass]] or [[High-bypass turbofan|high-bypass]], depending upon the amount of air which bypasses the core of the engine. Low-bypass turbofans have a [[bypass ratio]] of around 2:1 or less, meaning that for each kilogram of air that passes through the core of the engine, two kilograms or less of air bypass the core.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Low-bypass turbofans often use a mixed exhaust nozzle meaning that the bypassed flow and the core flow exit from the same nozzle.<ref name=\"M12\">Mattingly, p. 12</ref> High-bypass turbofans often have ratios from 4:1 up to 8:1, with the [[Rolls-Royce Holdings|Rolls-Royce]] [[Rolls-Royce Trent XWB|Trent XWB]] approaching 10:1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rolls-royce.com/customers/civil-aerospace/products/civil-large-engines/trent-xwb/trent-xwb-infographic.aspx |title=Trent XWB infographic |accessdate=2015-10-15}}</ref>\n\n=====Turboprop and turboshaft=====\n{{Main article|Turboprop|Turboshaft}}\n[[File:Turboprop operation-en.svg|thumb|right|Turboprop engine]]\n[[Turboprop]] engines are jet engine derivatives, still gas turbines, that extract work from the hot-exhaust jet to turn a rotating shaft, which is then used to produce thrust by some other means.  While not strictly jet engines in that they rely on an auxiliary mechanism to produce thrust, turboprops are very similar to other turbine-based jet engines, and are often described as such.\n\nIn turboprop engines, a portion of the engine's thrust is produced by spinning a [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]], rather than relying solely on high-speed jet exhaust. As their jet thrust is augmented by a propeller, turboprops are occasionally referred to as a type of hybrid jet engine. They are quite similar to turbofans in many respects, except that they use a traditional propeller to provide the majority of thrust, rather than a ducted fan. Both fans and propellers are powered the same way, although most turboprops use [[Transmission (mechanics)|gear-reduction]] between the turbine and the propeller ([[geared turbofan]]s also feature gear reduction). While many turboprops generate the majority of their thrust with the propeller, the hot-jet exhaust is an important design point, and maximum thrust is obtained by matching thrust contributions of the propeller to the hot jet.{{sfn |Hill|Peterson|1992| pp=190}} Turboprops generally have better performance than turbojets or turbofans at low speeds where propeller efficiency is high, but become increasingly noisy and inefficient at high speeds.{{sfn |Mattingly|2006| pp=12-14}}\n\nTurboshaft engines are very similar to turboprops, differing in that nearly all energy in the exhaust is extracted to spin the rotating shaft, which is used to power machinery rather than a propeller, they therefore generate little to no jet thrust and are often used to power [[helicopters]].<ref name=\"M12\"/>\n\n=====Propfan=====\n{{Main article|Propfan}}\n[[File:Nasa ge udf.jpg|thumb|right|A propfan engine]]\nA [[propfan]] engine (also called \"unducted fan\", \"open rotor\", or \"ultra-high bypass\") is a jet engine that uses its gas generator to power an exposed fan, similar to turboprop engines. Like turboprop engines, propfans generate most of their thrust from the propeller and not the exhaust jet. The primary difference between turboprop and propfan design is that the propeller blades on a propfan are highly swept to allow them to operate at speeds around [[Mach number|Mach]] 0.8, which is competitive with modern commercial turbofans. These engines have the fuel efficiency advantages of turboprops with the performance capability of commercial turbofans.<ref>Sweetman, Bill (2005).

''Air & Space Magazine''. 1 September 2005.</ref> While significant research and testing (including flight testing) has been conducted on propfans, no propfan engines have entered production.\n\n====Ram powered====\nRam powered jet engines are airbreathing engines similar to gas turbine engines and they both follow the [[Brayton cycle]]. Gas turbine and ram powered engines differ, however, in how they compress the incoming airflow. Whereas gas turbine engines use axial or centrifugal compressors to compress incoming air, ram engines rely only on air compressed through the inlet or diffuser.<ref name=\"m14\">Mattingly, p. 14</ref> Ram powered engines are considered the most simple type of air breathing jet engine because they can contain no moving parts.<ref>*{{Cite book\n|last1=Flack |first1=Ronald D.|title=Fundamentals of Jet Propulsion with Applications|series=Cambridge Aerospace Series|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York, NY|page=16|isbn=978-0-521-81983-1}}</ref>\n\n=====Ramjet=====\n{{Main article|Ramjet}}\n[[File:Ramjet operation.svg|thumb|right|A schematic of a ramjet engine, where \"M\" is the [[Mach number]] of the airflow.]]\nRamjets are the most basic type of ram powered jet engines. They consist of three sections; an inlet to compress incoming air, a combustor to inject and combust fuel, and a nozzle to expel the hot gases and produce thrust. Ramjets require a relatively high speed to efficiently compress the incoming air, so ramjets cannot operate at a standstill and they are most efficient at [[supersonic]] speeds. A key trait of ramjet engines is that combustion is done at subsonic speeds. The supersonic incoming air is dramatically slowed through the inlet, where it is then combusted at the much slower, subsonic, speeds.<ref name=\"m14\"/> The faster the incoming air is, however, the less efficient it becomes to slow it to subsonic speeds. Therefore, ramjet engines are limited to approximately Mach 5.<ref>Benson, Tom. [http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/ramjet.html Ramjet Propulsion]. NASA Glenn Research Center.

Like a ramjet, they consist of an inlet, a combustor, and a nozzle. The primary difference between ramjets and scramjets is that scramjets do not slow the oncoming airflow to subsonic speeds for combustion, they use supersonic combustion instead. The name \"scramjet\" comes from \"'''S'''upersonic '''C'''ombusting '''Ramjet'''.\" Since scramjets use supersonic combustion they can operate at speeds above Mach 6 where traditional ramjets are too inefficient. Another difference between ramjets and scramjets comes from how each type of engine compresses the oncoming airflow: while the inlet provides most of the compression for ramjets, the high speeds at which scramjets operate allow them to take advantage of the compression generated by [[shock waves]], primarily [[oblique shocks]].<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Heiser|first1=William H.|last2=Pratt|first2=David T.| title=Hypersonic Airbreathing Propulsion|series=AIAA Education Series|year=1994|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=23\u20134|isbn=1-56347-035-7}}</ref>\n\nVery few scramjet engines have ever been built and flown.

The temperature entering the nozzle may be as low as sea level ambient for a fan nozzle in the cold air at cruise altitudes. It may be as high as the 1000K exhaust gas temperature for a supersonic afterburning engine or 2200K with afterburner lit.<ref>\"Jet Propulsion\" Nicholas Cumpsty 1997, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0 521 59674 2, p.197</ref> The pressure entering the nozzle may vary from 1.5 times the pressure outside the nozzle, for a single stage fan, to 30 times for the fastest manned aircraft at mach 3+.<ref>http://www.enginehistory.org/Convention/convention1.shtml SR-71 overview part2 Fig.17</ref>\n\nThe velocity of the gas leaving a convergent nozzle may be subsonic or sonic (Mach 1) at low flight speeds or supersonic (Mach 3.0 at SR-71 cruise)<ref>[http://www.enginehistory.org/Convention/convention1.shtml AEHS Conventions 1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> for a con-di nozzle at higher speeds where the nozzle pressure ratio is increased with the intake ram.<ref>http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2004-3923 Fig.11</ref>\nThe nozzle thrust is highest if the static pressure of the gas reaches the ambient value as it leaves the nozzle. This only happens if the nozzle exit area is the correct value for the nozzle pressure ratio (npr). Since the npr changes with engine thrust setting and flight speed this is seldom the case. Also at supersonic speeds the divergent area is less than required to give complete internal expansion to ambient pressure as a trade-off with external body drag.

This force, called thrust, is the sum of the momentum difference between entry and exit and any unbalanced pressure force between entry and exit, as explained in \"Thrust calculation\". As an example, an early turbojet, the [[Bristol Olympus]] Mk. 101, had a momentum thrust of 9300 lb. and a pressure thrust of 1800 lb. giving a total of 11,100 lb.<ref>\"The Avro Type 698 Vulcan\" David W. Fildes, Pen & Sword Aviation 2012, ISBN 978 1 84884 284 7, p.301, Gas Floow Diagram</ref> Looking inside the \"black box\" shows that the thrust results from all the unbalanced momentum and pressure forces created within the engine itself.<ref>The Aircraft Gas Turbine and its operation December 1982, P&W Oper. Instr. 200, United Technologies Pratt & Whitney</ref> These forces, some forwards and some rearwards, are across all the internal parts, both stationary and rotating, such as ducts, compressors, etc., which are in the primary gas flow which flows through the engine from front to rear.

The aircraft \"holds\" the engine on the outer casing of the engine at some distance from the engine centreline (at the engine mounts). This arrangement causes the engine casing to bend (known as backbone bending) and the round rotor casings to distort (ovalization). Distortion of the engine structure has to be controlled with suitable mount locations to maintain acceptable rotor and seal clearances and prevent rubbing. A well-publicized example of excessive structural deformation occurred with the original [[Pratt & Whitney JT9D]] engine installation in the [[Boeing 747]] aircraft.<ref>https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%203201.html</ref> The engine mounting arrangement had to be revised with the addition of an extra thrust frame to reduce the casing deflections to an acceptable amount.<ref>https://www.google.com/patents/US3675418</ref><ref>\"747 Creating the world's first jumbo jet and other adventures from a life in aviation\" Joe Sutter, Smithsonian Books, ISBN 978-0-06-088241-9, p.185-188</ref>\n\n====Rotor thrust====\nThe rotor thrust on a thrust bearing is not related to the engine thrust. It may even change direction at some RPM. The bearing load is determined by bearing life considerations. Although the aerodynamic loads on the compressor and turbine blades contribute to the rotor thrust they are small compared to cavity loads inside the rotor which result from the secondary air system pressures and sealing diameters on discs, etc. To keep the load within the bearing specification seal diameters are chosen accordingly as, many years ago, on the backface of the impeller<ref>[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1947/1947%20-%200202.html de havilland | 1947 | 0202 | Flight Archive<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in the [[de Havilland Ghost]] engine. Sometimes an extra disc known as a balance piston has to be added inside the rotor.

It does not apply to rocket engines. Most types of jet engine have an air intake, which provides the bulk of the fluid exiting the exhaust. Conventional rocket engines, however, do not have an intake, the oxidizer and fuel both being carried within the vehicle. Therefore, rocket engines do not have ram drag and the gross thrust of the rocket engine nozzle is the net thrust of the engine. Consequently, the thrust characteristics of a rocket motor are different from that of an air breathing jet engine, and thrust is independent of velocity.\n\nIf the velocity of the jet from a jet engine is equal to sonic velocity, the jet engine's nozzle is said to be choked. If the nozzle is choked, the pressure at the nozzle exit plane is greater than atmospheric pressure, and extra terms must be added to the above equation to account for the pressure thrust.<ref name=Cumpsty/>\n\nThe rate of flow of fuel entering the engine is very small compared with the rate of flow of air.<ref name=Cumpsty/> If the contribution of fuel to the nozzle gross thrust is ignored, the net thrust is:\n\n:<math>F_N = \\dot{m}_{air} (v_e - v)</math>\n\nThe velocity of the jet ('''''v<sub>e</sub>''''') must exceed the true airspeed of the aircraft ('''''v''''') if there is to be a net forward thrust on the aircraft. The velocity ('''''v<sub>e</sub>''''') can be calculated thermodynamically based on adiabatic expansion.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/SPRING/propulsion/notes/node139.html 16.Unified: Thermodynamics and Propulsion, Prof. Z.

The afterburner also has to make up for the pressure loss across the turbomachine which is a drag item at higher speeds where the epr will be less than 1.0.<ref>\"Jet Propulsion For Aerospace Applications\" Second Edition 1964, Hesse and Mumford, Pitman Publishing Corporation, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 64-18757, p.375</ref><ref>\"F-12 Series Aircraft Propulsion System Performance and Development, David H. Campbell, J.

In the second case an increase in thrust within the existing speed capability is required. Compressor inlet cooling is used in the first case. A [[compressor map]] shows that the airflow reduces with increasing compressor inlet temperature although the compressor is still running at maximum RPM (but reduced aerodynamic speed). Compressor inlet cooling increases the aerodynamic speed and flow and thrust. In the second case a small increase in the maximum mechanical speed and turbine temperature were allowed, together with nitrous oxide injection into the afterburner and simultaneous increase in afterburner fuel flow.\n\n===Energy efficiency relating to aircraft jet engines===\nThis overview highlights where energy losses occur in complete jet aircraft powerplants or engine installations. It includes mention of inlet and exhaust nozzle losses which become increasingly significant at the high flight speeds achieved by some manned aircraft since only a small proportion, 17% for the SR-71 powerplant and 8% for the Concorde powerplant, of the thrust transmitted to the airframe came from the engine.\n\nA jet engine at rest, as on a test stand, sucks in fuel and tries to thrust itself forward. How well it does this is judged by how much fuel it uses and what force is required to restrain it. This is a measure of its efficiency. If something deteriorates inside the engine (known as performance deterioration<ref>Gas Turbine Performance Deterioration, Meher-Homji, Chaker and Motiwala, Proceedings Of The 30th Turbomachinery Symposium, ASME, p.139-175</ref>) it will be less efficient and this will show when the fuel produces less thrust. If a change is made to an internal part which allows the air/combustion gases to flow more smoothly the engine will be more efficient and use less fuel. A standard definition is used to assess how different things change engine efficiency and also to allow comparisons to be made between different engines. This definition is called [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]], or how much fuel is needed to produce one unit of thrust. For example, it will be known for a particular engine design that if some bumps in a bypass duct are smoothed out the air will flow more smoothly giving a pressure loss reduction of x% and y% less fuel will be needed to get the take-off thrust, for example. This understanding comes under the engineering discipline [[Jet engine performance]]. How efficiency is affected by forward speed and by supplying energy to aircraft systems is mentioned later.\n\nThe efficiency of the engine is controlled primarily by the operating conditions inside the engine which are the pressure produced by the compressor and the temperature of the combustion gases at the first set of rotating turbine blades. The pressure is the highest air pressure in the engine. The turbine rotor temperature is not the highest in the engine but is the highest at which energy transfer takes place ( higher temperatures occur in the combustor). The above pressure and temperature are shown on a [[Thermodynamic cycle]] diagram.\n\nThe efficiency is further modified by how smoothly the air and the combustion gases flow through the engine, how well the flow is aligned (known as incidence angle) with the moving and stationary passages in the compressors and turbines.<ref>\"Jet Propulsion' Nicholas Cumpsty, Cambridge University Press 2001, ISBN 0 521 59674 2, Figure 9.1 shows losses with incidence</ref> Non-optimum angles, as well as non-optimum passage and blade shapes can cause thickening and separation of [[Boundary layers]] and formation of [[Shock waves]] as explained in [[Effects of Mach number and shock losses in turbomachines]]. It is important to slow the flow (lower speed means less pressure losses or [[Pressure drop]]) when it travels through ducts connecting the different parts. How well the individual components contribute to turning fuel into thrust is quantified by measures like efficiencies for the compressors, turbines and combustor and pressure losses for the ducts.  These are shown as lines on a [[Thermodynamic cycle]] diagram.\n\nThe engine efficiency, or thermal efficiency,<ref>\"Jet Propulsion' Nicholas Cumpsty, Cambridge University Press 2001, ISBN 0 521 59674 2, p.35</ref> known as <math>\\eta_{th}</math>. is dependent on the [[Thermodynamic cycle]] parameters, maximum pressure and temperature, and on component efficiencies, <math>\\eta_{compressor}</math>, <math>\\eta_{combustion}</math> and <math>\\eta_{turbine}</math> and duct pressure losses.\n\nThe engine needs compressed air for itself just to run successfully. This air comes from its own compressor and is called secondary air. It does not contribute to making thrust so makes the engine less efficient. It is used to preserve the mechanical integrity of the engine, to stop parts overheating and to prevent oil escaping from bearings for example. Only some of this air taken from the compressors returns to the turbine flow to contribute to thrust production. Any reduction in the amount needed improves the engine efficiency. Again, it will be known for a particular engine design that a reduced requirement for cooling flow of x% will reduce the [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|specific fuel consumption]] by y%. In other words, less fuel will be required to give take-off thrust, for example. The engine is more efficient.\n\nAll of the above considerations are basic to the engine running on its own and, at the same time, doing nothing useful, i.e. it is not moving an aircraft or supplying energy for the aircraft's electrical, hydraulic and air systems. In the aircraft the engine gives away some of its thrust-producing potential, or fuel, to power these systems. These requirements, which cause installation losses,<ref>Gas Turbine Performance' Second Edition, Walsh and Fletcher, Blackwell Science Ltd., ISBN 0-632-06434-X, p.64</ref> reduce its efficiency. It is using some fuel that does not contribute to the engine's thrust.\n\nFinally, when the aircraft is flying the propelling jet itself contains wasted kinetic energy after it has left the engine. This is quantified by the term propulsive, or Froude, efficiency <math>\\eta_p</math> and may be reduced by redesigning the engine to give it bypass flow and a lower speed for the propelling jet, for example as a turboprop or turbofan engine. At the same time forward speed increases the <math>\\eta_{th}</math> by increasing the [[Overall pressure ratio]].\n\nThe overall efficiency of the engine at flight speed is defined as <math>\\eta_o = \\eta_p\\eta_{th}</math>.<ref>\"Jet Propulsion' Nicholas Cumpsty, Cambridge University Press 2001, ISBN 0 521 59674 2, p.26</ref>\n\nThe <math>\\eta_o</math> at flight speed depends on how well the intake compresses the air before it is handed over to the engine compressors. The intake compression ratio, which can be as high as 32:1 at Mach 3, adds to that of the engine compressor to give the [[Overall pressure ratio]] and <math>\\eta_{th}</math> for the [[Thermodynamic cycle]]. How well it does this is defined by its pressure recovery or measure of the losses in the intake. Mach 3 manned flight has provided an interesting illustration of how these losses can increase dramatically in an instant. The [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie]] and [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird]] at Mach 3 each had pressure recoveries of about 0.8,<ref>http://www.enginehistory.org/Convention/2013/HowInletsWork8-19-13.pdf Figure 22 Inlet Pressure Recovery</ref><ref>B-70 Aircraft Study Final Report Volume IV, SD 72-SH-0003 April 1972, L.J.Taube, Space Division North American Rockwell, p.IV-11</ref> due to relatively low losses during the compression process, i.e. through  systems of multiple shocks. During an 'unstart' the efficient shock system would be replaced by a very inefficient single shock beyond the inlet and an intake pressure recovery of about 0.3 and a correspondingly low pressure ratio.\n\nThe propelling nozzle at speeds above about Mach 2 usually has extra internal thrust losses because the exit area is not big enough as a trade-off with external afterbody drag.<ref>\"Design For Air Combat\" ray Whitford, Jane's Publishing Company Limited 1987, ISBN 0 7106 0426 2, p.203 'Area ratio for optimum expansion'</ref>\n\nAlthough a bypass engine improves propulsive efficiency it incurs losses of its own inside the engine itself. Machinery has to be added to transfer energy from the gas generator to a bypass airflow. The low loss from the propelling nozzle of a turbojet is added to with extra losses due to inefficiencies in the added turbine and fan.<ref>Gas Turbine Performance' Second Edition, Walsh and Fletcher, Blackwell Science Ltd., ISBN 0-632-06535-4, p.305\n</ref> These may be included in a transmission, or transfer, efficiency <math>\\eta_T</math>.

Heat engine efficiency is determined by the ratio of temperatures reached in the engine to that exhausted at the nozzle. This has improved constantly over time as new materials have been introduced to allow higher maximum cycle temperatures. For example, composite materials, combining metals with ceramics, have been developed for HP turbine blades, which run at the maximum cycle temperature.<ref>S. Walston, A. Cetel, R. MacKay, K.

Cycle efficiency is highest in rocket engines (~60+%), as they can achieve extremely high combustion temperatures. Cycle efficiency in turbojet and similar is nearer to 30%, due to much lower peak cycle temperatures.\n\n[[Image:Combustion efficiency of aircraft gas turbines.svg|thumb|left|Typical combustion efficiency of an aircraft gas turbine over the operational range.]]\n[[Image:Combustion stability limits of aircraft gas turbine.svg|thumb|right|Typical combustion stability limits of an aircraft gas turbine.]]\n\nThe combustion efficiency of most aircraft gas turbine engines at sea level takeoff conditions\nis almost 100%. It decreases nonlinearly to 98% at altitude cruise conditions. Air-fuel ratio ranges from 50:1 to 130:1. For any type of combustion chamber there is a ''rich'' and ''weak limit'' to the air-fuel ratio, beyond which the flame is extinguished. The range of air-fuel ratio between the rich and weak limits is reduced with an increase of air velocity. If the\nincreasing air mass flow reduces the fuel ratio below certain value, flame extinction occurs.<ref>Claire Soares, \"Gas Turbines: A Handbook of Air, Land and Sea Applications\", pp.&nbsp;140.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Specific-impulse-kk-20090105.png|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Specific impulse]] as a function of speed for different jet types with kerosene fuel (hydrogen I<sub>sp</sub> would be about twice as high). Although efficiency plummets with speed, greater distances are covered. Efficiency per unit distance (per km or mile) is roughly independent of speed for jet engines as a group; however, airframes become inefficient at supersonic speeds.]]\n\n===Consumption of fuel or propellant===\nA closely related (but different) concept to energy efficiency is the rate of consumption of propellant mass. Propellant consumption in jet engines is measured by '''[[Thrust specific fuel consumption|Specific Fuel Consumption]]''', '''[[Specific impulse]]''' or '''[[Effective exhaust velocity]]'''. They all measure the same thing. Specific impulse and effective exhaust velocity are strictly proportional, whereas specific fuel consumption is inversely proportional to the others.\n\nFor airbreathing engines such as turbojets, energy efficiency and propellant (fuel) efficiency are much the same thing, since the propellant is a fuel and the source of energy. In rocketry, the propellant is also the exhaust, and this means that a high energy propellant gives better propellant efficiency but can in some cases actually give ''lower'' energy efficiency.\n\nIt can be seen in the table (just below) that the subsonic turbofans such as General Electric's CF6 turbofan use a lot less fuel to generate thrust for a second than did the Concorde's Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593 turbojet. However, since energy is force times distance and the distance per second was greater for Concorde, the actual power generated by the engine for the same amount of fuel was higher for Concorde at Mach 2 than the CF6. Thus, the Concorde's engines were more efficient in terms of energy per mile.\n\n{{Thrust engine efficiency}}\n\n===Thrust-to-weight ratio===\n{{Main article|Thrust-to-weight ratio}}\nThe thrust-to-weight ratio of jet engines with similar configurations varies with scale, but is mostly a function of engine construction technology. For a given engine, the lighter the engine, the better the thrust-to-weight is, the less fuel is used to compensate for drag due to the lift needed to carry the engine weight, or to accelerate the mass of the engine.\n\nAs can be seen in the following table, rocket engines generally achieve much higher thrust-to-weight ratios than [[wiktionary:duct engine|duct engines]] such as turbojet and turbofan engines. This is primarily because rockets almost universally use dense liquid or solid reaction mass which gives a much smaller volume and hence the pressurization system that supplies the nozzle is much smaller and lighter for the same performance. Duct engines have to deal with air which is two to three orders of magnitude less dense and this gives pressures over much larger areas, which in turn results in more engineering materials being needed to hold the engine together and for the air compressor.\n\n{{Engine thrust to weight table}}\n\n===Comparison of types===\n[[Image:JetSuitabilityEn.png|thumb|Comparative suitability for (left to right) [[turboshaft]], [[Low-bypass turbofan|low bypass]] and [[turbojet]] to fly at 10 km altitude in various speeds. Horizontal axis - speed, m/s. Vertical axis displays engine efficiency.]]\n\nPropeller engines handle larger air mass flows, and give them smaller acceleration, than jet engines. Since the increase in air speed is small, at high flight speeds the thrust available to propeller-driven aeroplanes is small. However, at low speeds, these engines benefit from relatively high [[propulsive efficiency]].\n\nOn the other hand, turbojets accelerate a much smaller mass flow of intake air and burned fuel, but they then reject it at very high speed. When a [[de Laval nozzle]] is used to accelerate a hot engine exhaust, the outlet velocity may be locally [[Supersonic speed|supersonic]]. Turbojets are particularly suitable for aircraft travelling at very high speeds.\n\nTurbofans have a mixed exhaust consisting of the bypass air and the hot combustion product gas from the core engine. The amount of air that bypasses the core engine compared to the amount flowing into the engine determines what is called a turbofan's bypass ratio (BPR).\n\nWhile a turbojet engine uses all of the engine's output to produce thrust in the form of a hot high-velocity exhaust gas jet, a turbofan's cool low-velocity bypass air yields between 30% and 70% of the total thrust produced by a turbofan system.<ref>{{cite book|author=Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)|url=http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aircraft/airplane_handbook/media/FAA-H-8083-3B.pdf|title=FAA-H-8083-3B Airplane Flying Handbook Handbook|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|edition=|year=2004|isbn= }}</ref>\n\nThe net thrust ('''''F<sub>N</sub>''''') generated by a turbofan is:<ref>[http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/turbfan.html Turbofan Thrust, Glenn Research Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)]</ref>\n\n:<math>F_N = \\dot{m}_e v_e - \\dot{m}_o v_o + BPR\\, (\\dot{m}_c v_f)</math>\n\nwhere:\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|'''''\u1e41<sub>&thinsp;e</sub>''''' \n|align=\"left\"|= the mass rate of hot combustion exhaust flow from the core engine \n|-\n|align=right|'''''\u1e41<sub>o</sub>'''''\n|align=left|= the mass rate of total air flow entering the turbofan = '''''\u1e41<sub>c</sub>''''' + '''''\u1e41<sub>f</sub>'''''\n|-\n|align=right|'''''\u1e41<sub>c</sub>'''''\n|align=left|= the mass rate of intake air that flows to the core engine\n|-\n|align=right|'''''\u1e41<sub>f</sub>'''''\n|align=left|= the mass rate of intake air that bypasses the core engine\n|-\n|align=right|'''''v<sub>f</sub>'''''\n|align=left|= the velocity of the air flow bypassed around the core engine\n|-\n|align=right|'''''v<sub>e</sub>'''''\n|align=left|= the velocity of the hot exhaust gas from the core engine\n|-\n|align=right|'''''v<sub>o</sub>'''''\n|align=left|= the velocity of the total air intake = the true airspeed of the aircraft\n|-\n|align=left|'''''BPR'''''\n|align-right|= Bypass Ratio\n|}\n\n[[Rocket engine]]s have extremely high exhaust velocity and thus are best suited for high speeds ([[hypersonic]]) and great altitudes. At any given throttle, the thrust and efficiency of a rocket motor improves slightly with increasing altitude (because the back-pressure falls thus increasing net thrust at the nozzle exit plane), whereas with a turbojet (or turbofan) the falling density of the air entering the intake (and the hot gases leaving the nozzle) causes the net thrust to decrease with increasing altitude. Rocket engines are more efficient than even scramjets above roughly Mach 15.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.kth.se/courses/4A1346/2ndLecture/KTH%20High%20Speed.pdf |title=Microsoft PowerPoint - KTHhigspeed08.ppt |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref>\n\n===Altitude and speed===\nWith the exception of [[scramjet]]s, jet engines, deprived of their inlet systems can only accept air at around half the speed of sound. The inlet system's job for transonic and supersonic aircraft is to slow the air and perform some of the compression.\n\nThe limit on maximum altitude for engines is set by flammability- at very high altitudes the air becomes too thin to burn, or after compression, too hot. For turbojet engines altitudes of about 40&nbsp;km appear to be possible, whereas for ramjet engines 55&nbsp;km may be achievable. Scramjets may theoretically manage 75&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orbitalvector.com/Orbital%20Travel/Scramjets/Scramjets.htm |title=Scramjet |publisher=Orbitalvector.com |date=2002-07-30 |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref> Rocket engines of course have no upper limit.\n\nAt more modest altitudes, flying faster [[dynamic pressure|compresses the air at the front of the engine]], and this greatly heats the air. The upper limit is usually thought to be about Mach 5-8, as above about Mach 5.5, the atmospheric nitrogen tends to react due to the high temperatures at the inlet and this consumes significant energy. The exception to this is scramjets which may be able to achieve about Mach 15 or more{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, as they avoid slowing the air, and rockets again have no particular speed limit.\n\n===Noise===\nThe noise emitted by a jet engine has many sources. These include, in the case of gas turbine engines, the fan, compressor, combustor, turbine and propelling jet/s.<ref>\"Softly, softly towards the quiet jet\" Michael J. T. Smith New Scientist 19 February 1970 p350</ref>\n\nThe propelling jet produces jet noise which is caused by the violent mixing action of the high speed jet with the surrounding air. In the subsonic case the noise is produced by eddies and in the supersonic case by [[Mach wave]]s.<ref>\"Silencing the sources of jet noise\" Dr David Crighton New Scientist 27 July 1972 p185</ref> The sound power radiated from a jet varies with the jet velocity raised to the eighth power for velocities up to 2,000&nbsp;ft/sec and varies with the velocity cubed above 2,000&nbsp;ft/sec.<ref>\"Noise\" I.C. Cheeseman Flight International 16 April 1970 p639</ref> Thus, the lower speed exhaust jets emitted from engines such as high bypass turbofans are the quietest, whereas the fastest jets, such as rockets, turbojets, and ramjets, are the loudest. For commercial jet aircraft the jet noise has reduced from the turbojet through bypass engines to turbofans as a result of a progressive reduction in propelling jet velocities. For example, the JT8D, a bypass engine, has a jet velocity of 1450&nbsp;ft/sec whereas the JT9D, a turbofan, has jet velocities of 885&nbsp;ft/sec (cold) and 1190&nbsp;ft/sec (hot).<ref>\"The Aircraft Gas Turbine Engine and its operation\" United Technologies Pratt & Whitney Part No. P&W 182408 December 1982 Sea level static internal pressures and temperatures p219/220</ref>\n\nThe advent of the turbofan replaced the very distinctive jet noise with another sound known as \"buzz saw\" noise. The origin is the shockwaves originating at the supersonic fan blades at takeoff thrust.<ref>'Quietening a Quiet Engine- The RB211 Demonstrator Programme\" M. J. T.
