The vacuum-tube \n[[triode]], also called a (thermionic) valve,  was the transistor's precursor, introduced in 1907.\n\n==Invention of the transistor==\nThe first [[patent]]<ref>{{patent|US|1745175|[[Julius Edgar Lilienfeld]]: \"Method and apparatus for controlling electric current\" first filed in Canada on 22.10.1925, describing a device similar to a [[MESFET]]}}</ref> for the [[field-effect transistor]] principle was filed in Canada by [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian-Hungarian]] [[physicist]] [[Julius Edgar Lilienfeld]] on October 22, 1925, but Lilienfeld published no research articles about his devices, and his work was ignored by industry. In 1934 German physicist Dr. [[Oskar Heil]] patented another field-effect transistor.<ref>{{patent|GB|439457|[[Oskar Heil]]: \"Improvements in or relating to electrical amplifiers and other control arrangements and devices\" first filed in Germany on March 2, 1934}}</ref> There is no direct evidence that these devices were built, but later work in the 1990s show that one of Lilienfeld's designs worked as described and gave substantial gain. Legal papers from the [[Bell Labs]] patent show that [[William Shockley]] and a co-worker at Bell Labs, Gerald Pearson, had built operational versions from Lilienfeld's patents, yet they never referenced this work in any of their later research papers or historical articles.<ref name=\"ieee_ESEJ_Oct 98\">{{cite journal| url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel4/2222/15787/00730824.pdf?isnumber=&arnumber=730824 | author=Arns, R.G.| title=The other transistor: early history of the metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor| work= Engineering Science and Education Journal| date=October 1998| volume=7| issue=5| pages=233\u2013240| accessdate=October 28, 2012 | format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bardeen Shockley Brattain 1948.JPG|thumb|John Bardeen, William Shockley and Walter Brattain at Bell Labs, 1948.]]\nThe Bell Labs work on the transistor emerged from war-time efforts to produce extremely pure [[germanium]] \"crystal\" mixer [[diode]]s, used in [[radar]] units as a [[frequency mixer]] element in [[microwave]] radar receivers. A parallel project on [[germanium diode]]s at [[Purdue University]] succeeded in producing the good-quality germanium semiconducting crystals that were used at Bell Labs.<ref name=purdue_semi_history>Bray, Ralph \"[http://www.physics.purdue.edu/about_us/history/semi_conductor_research.shtml The Origin of Semiconductor Research at Purdue]\". Purdue University, Department of Physics</ref> Early tube-based circuits did not switch fast enough for this role, leading the Bell team to use solid state [[diode]]s instead.\n\nAfter the war, Shockley decided to attempt the building of a [[triode]]-like semiconductor device. He secured funding and lab space, and went to work on the problem with Bardeen and Brattain. [[John Bardeen]] eventually developed a new branch of [[quantum mechanics]] known as [[surface physics]] to account for the \"odd\" behavior they saw, and Bardeen and [[Walter Brattain]] eventually succeeded in building a working device.\n\nThe key to the development of the transistor was the further understanding of the process of the [[electron mobility]] in a semiconductor. It was realized that if there was some way to control the flow of the electrons from the emitter to the collector of this newly discovered diode (discovered 1874; patented 1906), one could build an [[amplifier]]. For instance, if one placed contacts on either side of a single type of crystal the current would not flow through it. However, if a third contact could then \"inject\" electrons or holes into the material, the current would flow.\n\nActually doing this appeared to be very difficult. If the crystal were of any reasonable size, the number of electrons (or holes) required to be injected would have to be very large -\u2013 making it less useful than an amplifier because it would require a large injection current to start with. That said, the whole idea of the crystal diode was that the crystal itself could provide the electrons over a very small distance, the depletion region. The key appeared to be to place the input and output contacts very close together on the surface of the crystal on either side of this region.\n\nBrattain started working on building such a device, and tantalizing hints of amplification continued to appear as the team worked on the problem. Sometimes the system would work but then stop working unexpectedly. In one instance a non-working system started working when placed in water. The electrons in any one piece of the crystal would migrate about due to nearby charges. Electrons in the emitters, or the \"holes\" in the collectors, would cluster at the surface of the crystal where they could find their opposite charge \"floating around\" in the air (or water). Yet they could be pushed away from the surface with the application of a small amount of charge from any other location on the crystal. Instead of needing a large supply of injected electrons, a very small number in the right place on the crystal would accomplish the same thing.\n\nTheir understanding solved the problem of needing a very small control area to some degree. Instead of needing two separate semiconductors connected by a common, but tiny, region, a single larger surface would serve. The emitter and collector leads would both be placed very close together on the top, with the control lead placed on the base of the crystal. When current was applied to the \"base\" lead, the electrons or holes would be pushed out, across the block of semiconductor, and collect on the far surface. As long as the emitter and collector were very close together, this should allow enough electrons or holes between them to allow conduction to start.\n\nAn early witness of the phenomenon was [[Ralph Bray]], a young graduate student. He joined the germanium effort at Purdue University in November 1943 and was given the tricky task of measuring the spreading resistance at the metal-semiconductor contact. Bray found a great many anomalies, such as internal high-resistivity barriers in some samples of germanium. The most curious phenomenon was the exceptionally low resistance observed when voltage pulses were applied. This effect remained a mystery because nobody realised, until 1948, that Bray had observed minority carrier injection - the effect that was identified by William Shockley at Bell Labs and made the transistor a reality.\n\nBray wrote: \"That was the one aspect that we missed, but even had we understood the idea of minority carrier injection...we would have said, 'Oh, this explains our effects.' We might not necessarily have gone ahead and said, 'Let's start making transistors,' open up a factory and sell them... At that time the important device was the high back voltage rectifier\".<ref>R. Bray, interview with P. Henriksen, 14 May 1982, Niels Bohr Library, American Institute of Physics, New York.</ref>\n\n===The first transistor===\n[[Image:Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg|thumb|A stylized replica of the first transistor]]\nThe Bell team made many attempts to build such a system with various tools, but generally failed. Setups where the contacts were close enough were invariably as fragile as the original cat's whisker detectors had been, and would work briefly, if at all. Eventually they had a practical breakthrough. A piece of gold foil was glued to the edge of a plastic wedge, and then the foil was sliced with a razor at the tip of the triangle. The result was two very closely spaced contacts of gold. When the plastic was pushed down onto the surface of a crystal and voltage applied to the other side (on the base of the crystal), current started to flow from one contact to the other as the base voltage pushed the electrons away from the base towards the other side near the contacts. The [[point-contact transistor]] had been invented.\n\nOn 15 December 1947, \"When the points were, very close together got voltage amp about 2 but not power amp. This voltage amplification was independent of frequency 10 to 10,000 cycles\".<ref>W. H. Brattain, entry of 15 December 1947, laboratory notebook, case 38139-7. Bell Laboratories archives.</ref>\n\nOn 16 December 1947, \"Using this double point contact, contact was made to a germanium surface that had been anodized to 90 volts, electrolyte washed off in H<sub>2</sub>O and then had some gold spots evaporated on it. The gold contacts were pressed down on the bare surface. Both gold contacts to the surface rectified nicely... The separation between points was about 4x10<sup>\u22123</sup> cm. One point was used as a grid and the other point as a plate. The bias (D.C.) on the grid had to be positive to get amplification... power gain 1.3 voltage gain 15 on a plate bias of about 15 volts\".<ref>Brattain, entry of 16 December 1947 (ibid)</ref>\n\nBrattain and H. R. Moore made a demonstration to several of their colleagues and managers at Bell Labs on the afternoon of 23 December 1947, often given as the birth date of the transistor. The \"PNP point-contact germanium transistor\" operated as a speech amplifier with a power gain of 18 in that trial. In 1956 [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Houser Brattain]], and [[William Bradford Shockley]] were honored with the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] \"for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect\".\n\nTwelve people are mentioned as directly involved in the invention of the transistor in the Bell Laboratory.<ref>W. S. Gorton, \"Genesis of the Transistor,\" written in December 1949 and intended for volume 3 of A History of Engineering and Science in the Bell System.</ref>\n\nAt the same time some European scientists were led by the idea of solid-state amplifiers. In August 1948 German physicists [[Herbert Matar\u00e9|Herbert F. Matar\u00e9]] (1912\u20132011) and [[Heinrich Welker]] (1912\u20131981), working at [[Compagnie des Freins et Signaux Westinghouse]] in [[Aulnay-sous-Bois]], [[France]] applied for a patent on an amplifier based on the minority carrier injection process which they called the \"transistron\".<ref>{{patent|FR|1010427|H.

Matar\u00e9 had first observed transconductance effects during the manufacture of silicon diodes for German radar equipment during [[World War II|WWII]]. Transistrons were commercially manufactured for the French telephone company and military, and in 1953 a solid-state radio receiver with four transistrons was demonstrated at the [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] Radio Fair.\n\n==Origin of the term==\n[[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] needed a generic name for the new invention: \"Semiconductor Triode\", \"Surface States Triode\", \"Crystal Triode\", \"Solid Triode\" and \"Iotatron\" were all considered, but \"Transistor,\" coined by [[John R.

However, in 1950 Shockley developed a radically different type of solid-state amplifier which became known as the [[Bipolar Junction Transistor|bipolar junction]] \"transistor\".  Although it works on a completely different principle to the [[point-contact transistor|point-contact \"transistor\"]], this is the device which is most commonly referred to as simply a \"transistor\" today.  [[Morgan Sparks]] made the bipolar junction transistor into a practical device.<ref name=LCSN>{{cite news |author= Melanie Dabovich (Associated Press)|title= Former Sandia labs director dies|url= http://www.lcsun-news.com/ci_9170909|publisher= Las Cruces Sun-News|location=New Mexico|date= 2008-05-06|accessdate=2008-05-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080510080412/http://www.lcsun-news.com/ci_9170909 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-10}}</ref><ref name=PBS>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/transistor/album1/sparks/index.html |title=Morgan Sparks |accessdate= 2008-05-06|publisher=PBS}}</ref> These were also licensed to a number of other electronics companies, including [[Texas Instruments]], who produced a limited run of [[transistor radio]]s as a sales tool.  Early transistors were chemically unstable and only suitable for low-power, low-frequency applications, but as transistor design developed, these problems were slowly overcome.\n\nThere are numerous claimants to the title of the first company to produce practical transistor radios.  [[Texas Instruments]] had demonstrated all-transistor AM radios as early as 1952, but their performance was well below that of equivalent battery tube models. A workable all-[[transistor radio]] was demonstrated in August 1953 at the [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] Radio Fair by the German firm Intermetall.  It was built with four of Intermetall's hand-made transistors, based upon the 1948 invention of Herbert Matar\u00e9 and Heinrich Welker.<!--<ref name=Dormael-CHE-2004></ref> -->\nHowever, as with the early Texas units (and others) only prototypes were ever built; it was never put into commercial production.\n\nThe production of the first commercially successful transistor radio is often incorrectly attributed to [[Sony]] (originally Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo). However the [[Regency TR-1]], made by the Regency Division of I.D.E.A. (Industrial Development Engineering Associates) of Indianapolis, Indiana, was the first practical transistor radio made in any significant numbers.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}  The TR-1 was announced on October 18, 1954 and put on sale in November 1954 for $49.95 (the equivalent of about $361 in year-2005 dollars) and sold about 150,000 units.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nThe TR-1 used four Texas NPN transistors and had to be powered by a 22.5-volt battery, since the only way to get adequate [[radio frequency]] performance out of early transistors was to run them close to their collector-to-emitter [[breakdown voltage]]. This made the TR-1 very expensive to run, and it was far more popular for its novelty or status value that its actual performance, rather in the fashion of the first [[MP3 player]]s.\n\nStill, aside from its indifferent performance, the TR-1 was a very advanced product for its time, using [[printed circuit board]]s, and what were then considered micro-miniature components.\n\n[[Masaru Ibuka]], co-founder of the Japanese firm [[Sony]], was visiting the USA when Bell Labs announced the availability of manufacturing licenses, including detailed instructions on how to manufacture junction transistors. Ibuka obtained special permission from the Japanese Ministry of Finance to pay the $50,000 license fee, and in 1955 the company introduced their own five-transistor \"coatpocket\" radio, the TR-55, under the new brand name [[Sony]]. This product was soon followed by more ambitious designs, but it is generally regarded as marking the commencement of Sony's growth into a manufacturing superpower.\n\nThe TR-55 was quite similar to the Regency TR-1 in many ways, being powered by the same sort of 22.5-volt battery, and was not much more practical. Note: according to the schematic, the TR-55 used a 6 volt supply.<ref>http://www.radiomuseum.org/schemaviewer/japan_sony_tr55_sch_1.pdf</ref> Very few were distributed outside Japan. It was not until 1957 that Sony produced their ground-breaking \"TR-63\" shirt pocket radio, a much more advanced design that ran on a standard 9-volt battery and could compete favorably with vacuum tube portables. The TR-63 was also the first transistor radio to use all miniature components. (The term \"pocket\" was a matter of some interpretation, as Sony allegedly had special shirts made with over-sized pockets for their salesmen.)\n\n===Chrysler Mopar 914HR \u2013 first transistor car radio===\n[[File:Chryslyer imperial all transistor car radio audio sound news clip.ogg|left|thumb|1955 Chrysler\u2013Philco all transistor car radio \u2013 \"Breaking News\" radio broadcast announcement]]\n\nIn the April 28th 1955 edition of the Wall Street Journal, Chrysler and Philco announced that they had developed and produced the world\u2019s first all-transistor car radio.<ref>Wall Street Journal, \"Chrysler Promises Car Radio With Transistors Instead of Tubes in '56\", April 28th 1955, page 1</ref> Chrysler made the all-transistor car radio, Mopar model 914HR, available as an \"option\" in Fall 1955 for its new line of 1956 Chrysler and Imperial cars, which hit the showroom floor on October 21, 1955.

The computer was built by Dick Grimsdale, then a research student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and later a Professor of Electronic Engineering at Sussex University. The machine used point-contact transistors, made in small quantities by STC and Mullard. These consisted of a single crystal of germanium with two fine wires, resembling the crystal and cat\u2019s whisker of the 1920s. These transistors had the useful property that a single transistor could possess two stable states. ... The development of the machine was severely hampered by the unreliability of the transistors, which consumed 150 watts.<ref>[http://www.computer50.org/ The University of Manchester Celebrates the Birth of the Modern Computer] from Computer50.org</ref>\n\nMetropolitan Vickers Ltd rebuilt the full 200 transistor (& 1300 diode) design in 1956 using junction transistors (for internal use).<ref>[http://curation.cs.manchester.ac.uk/computer50/www.computer50.org/kgill/transistor/trans.html The Transistor Computer]</ref>\n\nThe [[IBM 7070]] (1958), [[IBM 7090]] (1959), and [[CDC 1604]] (1960) were the first computers (as products for sale) based on transistors.\n\n== Improvements in transistor design ==\nShockley was upset about the device being credited to Brattain and Bardeen, whom he felt had built it \"behind his back\" to take the glory.  Matters became worse when Bell Labs lawyers found that some of Shockley's own writings on the transistor were close enough to those of an earlier 1925 patent by [[Julius Edgar Lilienfeld]] that they thought it best that his name be left off the patent application.\n\nShockley was incensed, and decided to demonstrate who was the real brains of the operation. Only a few months later he invented an entirely new type of transistor with a layer or \"sandwich\" structure.  This new form was considerably more robust than the fragile point-contact system, and would go on to be used for the vast majority of all transistors into the 1960s.  It would evolve into the [[bipolar junction transistor]].\n\nFurther developments included the [[grown-junction transistor]] (1951),  the [[surface-barrier transistor]] (1953), the [[diffused base transistor|diffusion transistor]], the [[tetrode transistor]], and the [[pentode transistor]].
