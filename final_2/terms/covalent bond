Thus, covalent bonding does not necessarily require that the two atoms be of the same elements, only that they be of comparable electronegativity. Covalent bonding that entails sharing of electrons over more than two atoms is said to be [[delocalized electron|delocalized]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:covalent.svg|thumb|200px|Early concepts in covalent bonding arose from this kind of image of the molecule of [[methane]]. Covalent bonding is implied in the [[Lewis structure]] by indicating electrons shared between atoms.]]\n\nThe term ''covalence'' in regard to bonding was first used in 1919 by [[Irving Langmuir]] in a ''[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]'' article entitled \"The Arrangement of Electrons in Atoms and Molecules\". Langmuir wrote that \"we shall denote by the term ''covalence'' the number of pairs of electrons that a given atom shares with its neighbors.\"<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja02227a002|volume=41|issue=6|pages=868\u2013934|last=Langmuir|first=Irving|title=The Arrangement of Electrons in Atoms and Molecules|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=1919-06-01}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of covalent bonding can be traced several years before 1919 to [[Gilbert N. Lewis]], who in 1916 described the sharing of electron pairs between atoms.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja02261a002|volume=38|issue=4|pages=762\u2013785|last=Lewis|first=Gilbert N.|title=The atom and the molecule|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=1916-04-01}}</ref> He introduced the ''[[Lewis Structure|Lewis notation]]'' or ''electron dot notation'' or ''Lewis dot structure'', in which valence electrons (those in the outer shell) are represented as dots around the atomic symbols. Pairs of electrons located between atoms represent covalent bonds. Multiple pairs represent multiple bonds, such as [[double bond]]s and [[triple bond]]s. An alternative form of representation, not shown here, has bond-forming electron pairs represented as solid lines.\n\nLewis proposed that an atom forms enough covalent bonds to form a full (or closed) outer electron shell. In the methane diagram shown here, the carbon atom has a valence of four and is, therefore, surrounded by eight electrons (the [[octet rule]]), four from the carbon itself and four from the hydrogens bonded to it. Each hydrogen has a valence of one and is surrounded by two electrons (a duet rule) \u2013 its own one electron plus one from the carbon. The numbers of electrons correspond to full shells in the quantum theory of the atom; the outer shell of a carbon atom is the ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 shell, which can hold eight electrons, whereas the outer (and only) shell of a hydrogen atom is the ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 shell, which can hold only two.\n\nWhile the idea of shared electron pairs provides an effective qualitative picture of covalent bonding, [[quantum mechanics]] is needed to understand the nature of these bonds and predict the structures and properties of simple molecules. [[Walter Heitler]] and [[Fritz London]] are credited with the first successful quantum mechanical explanation of a chemical bond ([[molecular hydrogen]]) in 1927.<ref>{{cite journal|first=W.|last=Heitler|first2=F.|last2=London|title=Wechselwirkung neutraler Atome und hom\u00f6opolare Bindung nach der Quantenmechanik|trans-title=Interaction of neutral atoms and homeopolar bonds according to quantum mechanics|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik|volume=44|issue=6\u20137|pages=455\u2013472|date=1927|doi=10.1007/bf01397394}} English translation in {{cite book| last = Hettema| first = H.| title = Quantum Chemistry: Classic Scientific Papers| url = https://books.google.com/?id=qsidHRJmUoIC| accessdate = 2012-02-05| year = 2000| publisher = World Scientific| isbn = 978-981-02-2771-5| pages = 140}}</ref> Their work was based on the valence bond model, which assumes that a chemical bond is formed when there is good overlap between the [[atomic orbitals]] of participating atoms.\n\n==Types of covalent bonds==\nAtomic orbitals (except for s orbitals) have specific directional properties leading to different types of covalent bonds. [[Sigma bond|Sigma (\u03c3) bond]]s are the strongest covalent bonds and are due to head-on overlapping of orbitals on two different atoms. A [[single bond]] is usually a \u03c3 bond. [[Pi bond|Pi (\u03c0) bonds]] are weaker and are due to lateral overlap between p (or d) orbitals. A [[double bond]] between two given atoms consists of one \u03c3 and one \u03c0 bond, and a [[triple bond]] is one \u03c3 and two \u03c0 bonds.\n\nCovalent bonds are also affected by the electronegativity of the connected atoms which determines the [[chemical polarity]] of the bond. Two atoms with equal electronegativity will make nonpolar covalent bonds such as H\u2013H. An unequal relationship creates a polar covalent bond such as with H\u2212Cl.\n\n== Covalent structures ==\nThere are several types of structures for covalent substances, including individual molecules, molecular structures, [[macromolecular]] structures and giant covalent structures. Individual molecules have strong bonds that hold the atoms together, but there are negligible forces of attraction between molecules. Such covalent substances are usually gases, for example, HCl, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and CH<sub>4</sub>. In molecular structures, there are weak forces of attraction. Such covalent substances are low-boiling-temperature liquids (such as [[ethanol]]), and low-melting-temperature solids (such as [[iodine]] and solid CO<sub>2</sub>). Macromolecular structures have large numbers of atoms linked by covalent bonds in chains, including synthetic polymers such as [[polyethylene]] and [[nylon]], and biopolymers such as [[protein]]s and [[starch]]. [[Network covalent bonding|Network covalent structures]] (or giant covalent structures) contain large numbers of atoms linked in sheets (such as [[graphite]]), or 3-dimensional structures (such as [[diamond]] and [[quartz]]). These substances have high melting and boiling points, are frequently brittle, and tend to have high electrical [[resistivity]]. Elements that have high [[electronegativity]], and the ability to form three or four electron pair bonds, often form such large macromolecular structures.<ref name=\"StranksEtAl1970\">{{cite book |last1=Stranks |first1=D.

The simplest example of a 1-electron bond is found in the [[dihydrogen cation]], {{chem|H|2|+}}. One-electron bonds often have about half the bond energy of a 2-electron bond, and are therefore called \"half bonds\". However, there are exceptions: in the case of [[dilithium]], the bond is actually stronger for the 1-electron {{chem|Li|2|+}} than for the 2-electron Li<sub>2</sub>. This exception can be explained in terms of hybridization and inner-shell effects.<ref>{{cite book | title=Valency and Bonding| publisher=Cambridge | year=2005 |pages=96\u2013100 | last1=Weinhold|first1= F. |last2= Landis|first2= C. | isbn=0-521-83128-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Graphical comparison of bonds.svg|150px|thumb|left|Comparison of the electronic structure of the three-electron bond to the conventional covalent bond.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Harcourt |editor-first=Richard D.|title=Bonding in Electron-Rich Molecules: Qualitative Valence-Bond Approach via Increased-Valence Structures |publisher=Springer |date=2015 |chapter=Chapter 2: Pauling \"3-Electron Bonds\", 4-Electron 3-Centre Bonding, and the Need for an \"Increased-Valence\" Theory|isbn=9783319166766}}</ref>]]\nThe simplest example of three-electron bonding can be found in the [[helium dimer]] cation, {{chem|He|2|+}}. It is considered a \"half bond\" because it consists of only one shared electron (rather than two); in molecular orbital terms, the third electron is in an anti-bonding orbital which cancels out half of the bond formed by the other two electrons. Another example of a molecule containing a 3-electron bond, in addition to two 2-electron bonds, is [[nitric oxide]], NO. The oxygen molecule, O<sub>2</sub> can also be regarded as having two 3-electron bonds and one 2-electron bond, which accounts for its [[paramagnetism]] and its formal bond order of 2.<ref name=\"pauling\">{{cite book|last=Pauling|first=L.|date=1960|title=The Nature of the Chemical Bond|publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=340\u2013354}}</ref> [[Chlorine dioxide]] and its heavier analogues [[bromine dioxide]] and iodine dioxide also contain three-electron bonds.\n\nMolecules with odd-electron bonds are usually highly reactive. These types of bond are only stable between atoms with similar electronegativities.<ref name=\"pauling\" />\n\n== Resonance ==\n{{Main article|Resonance (chemistry)}}\nThere are situations whereby a single [[Lewis structure]] is insufficient to explain the electron configuration in a molecule, hence a superposition of structures are needed. The same two atoms in such molecules can be bonded differently in different structures (a single bond in one, a double bond in another, or even none at all), resulting in a non-integer [[bond order]]. The [[nitrate]] ion is one such example with three equivalent structures. The bond between the nitrogen and each oxygen is a double bond in one structure and a single bond in the other two, so that the average bond order for each N\u2013O interaction is {{sfrac|2 + 1 + 1|3}} = {{sfrac|4|3}}.\n\n[[File:Nitrate-ion-resonance-2D.png|400px|Canonical resonance structures for the nitrate ion]]\n\n=== Aromaticity ===\n{{Main article|Aromaticity}}\n\nIn [[organic chemistry]], when a molecule with a planar ring obeys [[H\u00fcckel's rule]], where the number of [[pi bond|\u03c0 electrons]] fit the formula 4''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2 (where ''n'' is an integer), it attains extra stability and symmetry. In [[benzene]], the prototypical aromatic compound, there are 6 \u03c0 bonding electrons (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, 4''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;6). These occupy three delocalized \u03c0 molecular orbitals ([[molecular orbital theory]]) or form conjugate \u03c0 bonds in two resonance structures that linearly combine ([[valence bond theory]]), creating a regular hexagon exhibiting a greater stabilization than the hypothetical 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene.\n\nIn the case of [[heterocyclic]] aromatics and substituted [[benzene]]s, the electronegativity differences between different parts of the ring may dominate the chemical behaviour of aromatic ring bonds, which otherwise are equivalent.\n\n=== Hypervalence ===\n{{Main article|Hypervalent molecule}}\nCertain molecules such as [[xenon difluoride]] and [[sulfur hexafluoride]] have higher co-ordination numbers than would be possible due to strictly covalent bonding according to the [[octet rule]]. This is explained by the [[three-center four-electron bond]] (\"3c\u20134e\") model which interprets the molecular wavefunction in terms of non-bonding [[HOMO/LUMO|highest occupied molecular orbital]]s in [[molecular orbital theory]] and ionic-covalent [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]] in [[valence bond theory]].\n\n=== Electron-deficiency ===\n{{Main article|Electron deficiency}}\nIn [[three-center two-electron bond]]s (\"3c\u20132e\") three atoms share two electrons in bonding. This type of bonding occurs in electron deficient compounds like [[diborane]]. Each such bond (2 per molecule in diborane) contains a pair of electrons which connect the boron atoms to each other in a banana shape, with a proton (nucleus of a hydrogen atom) in the middle of the bond, sharing electrons with both boron atoms. In certain [[cluster chemistry|cluster compounds]], so-called [[four-center two-electron bond]]s also have been postulated.\n\n== Quantum mechanical description ==\n{{main article|Chemical bonding model}}\nAfter the development of quantum mechanics, two basic theories were proposed to provide a quantum description of chemical bonding: [[valence bond theory|valence bond (VB) theory]] and [[molecular orbital theory|molecular orbital (MO) theory]].
