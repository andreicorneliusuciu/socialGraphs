Campbell, Jr.]] at his ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' magazine\u2014though Heinlein denied that Campbell influenced his writing to any great degree.\n\nWithin the framework of his science-fiction stories, Heinlein repeatedly addressed certain social themes: the importance of individual [[liberty]] and [[Individualism|self-reliance]], the obligation individuals owe to their societies, the influence of organized religion on culture and government, and the tendency of society to repress [[nonconformist]] thought. He also speculated on the influence of space travel on human cultural practices.\n\nHeinlein was named the first [[SFWA Grand Master|Science Fiction Writers Grand Master]] in 1974.<!--presented 1975--><ref name=SFWA/> He won [[Hugo Award]]s for four of his novels; in addition, fifty years after publication, five of his works were awarded \"[[Retro Hugos]]\"\u2014awards given retrospectively for works that were published before the Hugo Awards came into existence.<ref name=SFAwards/> In his fiction, Heinlein coined terms that have become part of the English language, including \"[[grok]]\", \"[[remote manipulator|waldo]]\", and \"[[speculative fiction]]\", as well as popularizing existing terms like \"[[There ain't no such thing as a free lunch|TANSTAAFL]]\", \"[[pay it forward]]\", and \"[[space marine]]\".

He graduated from the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] with the class of 1929 and went on to serve as an officer in the Navy. He was assigned to the new [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|6}} in 1931, where he worked in [[radio communications]], then in its earlier phases, with the carrier's [[aircraft]]. The [[Captain (Naval)|captain]] of this carrier was [[Ernest J. King]], who later served as the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] and [[Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet|Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Fleet]] during [[World War II]]. Heinlein was frequently interviewed during his later years by military historians who asked him about Captain King and his service as the commander of the U.S. Navy's first modern aircraft carrier.\n\nHeinlein also served aboard the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Roper|DD-147|6}} in 1933 and 1934, reaching the rank of lieutenant. His brother, Lawrence Heinlein, served in the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force, and the [[Missouri National Guard]], and he rose to the rank of [[major general (United States)|major general]] in the National Guard.<ref>[http://www2.ku.edu/~sfcenter/Gunn-GrandMaster-remarks.htm James Gunn, \"Grand Master Award Remarks\"]; [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1908&dat=19660627&id=uUgrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ktQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3796,2847290 \"Credit Col.

During a lengthy hospitalization, he developed a design for a [[waterbed]].<ref>''Expanded Universe''</ref>\n\nAfter his discharge, Heinlein attended a few weeks of graduate classes in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (UCLA), but he soon quit either because of his health or from a desire to enter politics.<ref>Afterword to ''[[For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs]]'', 2004 edition, p. 245.</ref>\n\nHeinlein supported himself at several occupations, including real estate sales and silver mining, but for some years found money in short supply.  Heinlein was active in [[Upton Sinclair]]'s socialist [[End Poverty in California movement]] in the early 1930s.  When Sinclair gained the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination for [[Governor of California]] in 1934, Heinlein worked actively in the campaign.  Heinlein himself ran for the [[California State Assembly]] in 1938, but was unsuccessful.<ref>Heinlein was running as a left-wing Democrat in a conservative district, and he never made it past the Democratic primary because of trickery by his Republican opponent (afterword to ''For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs'', 2004 edition, p. 247, and the story \"[[A Bathroom of Her Own]]\").

His first published story, \"[[Life-Line]]\", was printed in the August 1939 issue of  ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science-Fiction]]''.<ref name=\"isfdb ...\" /> Originally written for a contest, it was instead sold to ''Astounding'' for significantly more than the contest's first-prize payoff. Another [[Future History (Heinlein)|Future History]] story, \"Misfit\", followed in November.<ref name=\"isfdb ...\" /> Heinlein was quickly acknowledged as a leader of the new movement toward [[social science fiction|\"social\" science fiction]]. In California he hosted the [[Ma\u00f1ana Literary Society]], a 1940\u201341 series of informal gatherings of new authors.<ref>Williamson, Jack ''Who Was Robert Heinlein?'' in ''Requiem : new collected works by Robert A.

During [[World War II]], he did [[aeronautical engineering]] for the U.S. Navy, also recruiting Isaac Asimov and [[L. Sprague de Camp]] to work at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]] in [[Pennsylvania]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\nAs the war wound down in 1945, Heinlein began re-evaluating his career.  The [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], along with the outbreak of the [[Cold War]], galvanized him to write nonfiction on political topics.  In addition, he wanted to break into better-paying markets.  He published four influential [[short story|short stories]] for ''The Saturday Evening Post'' magazine, leading off, in February 1947, with \"[[The Green Hills of Earth]]\".  That made him the first science fiction writer to break out of the \"pulp ghetto\". In 1950, the movie ''[[Destination Moon (film)|Destination Moon]]''\u2014the documentary-like film for which he had written the story and scenario, co-written the script, and invented many of the effects\u2014won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[special effect]]s.  Also, he embarked on a series of [[young adult literature|juvenile novels]] for the [[Charles Scribner's Sons]] publishing company that went from 1947 through 1959, at the rate of one book each autumn, in time for Christmas presents to teenagers. He also wrote for ''[[Boys' Life]]'' in 1952.\n\n[[File:heinleins-house.jpg|thumb|Robert and Virginia Heinlein in a 1952 ''Popular Mechanics'' article, titled \"A House to Make Life Easy\".

They would remain married until Heinlein's death.\n\nAs Heinlein's increasing success as a writer resolved their initial financial woes, they had a house custom built with various innovative features, later described in an article in ''[[Popular Mechanics]]''. In 1965, after various chronic health problems of Virginia's were traced back to [[altitude sickness]], they moved to [[Santa Cruz, California]], at sea level, while they were building a new residence in the adjacent [[village]] of [[Bonny Doon, California]].<ref>Heinlein, Robert A.

(In a private correspondence, he referred to that as his \"usual and favorite occupation between books.\")<ref>Virginia Heinlein to Michael A. Banks, 1988</ref> The decade began with a life-threatening attack of [[peritonitis]], recovery from which required more than two years, and treatment of which required multiple transfusions of Heinlein's [[Human blood group systems#Blood group systems|rare blood type, A2 negative]].<!-- *not* \"AB negative\"--><ref name=FEEblood>[https://fee.org/articles/robert-a-heinleins-soaring-spirit-of-liberty/ Robert A.

A version of the former, titled ''Paul Dirac, Antimatter, and You'', was published in the anthology ''[[Expanded Universe (Heinlein)|Expanded Universe]]'', and it demonstrates both Heinlein's skill as a popularizer and his lack of depth in physics.

While vacationing in Tahiti in early 1978, he suffered a [[transient ischemic attack]].  Over the next few months, he became more and more exhausted, and his health again began to decline.  The problem was determined to be a blocked carotid artery, and he had one of the earliest known carotid bypass operations to correct it.  Heinlein and Virginia had been smokers,<ref>Photograph, probably from 1967, pg. 127 of ''Grumbles from the Grave''</ref> and smoking appears often in his fiction, as do fictitious strikable self-lighting cigarettes.\n\nIn 1980 Robert Heinlein was a member of the Citizens Advisory Council on National Space Policy, chaired by [[Jerry Pournelle]], which met at the home of SF writer [[Larry Niven]] to write space policy papers for the incoming [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] Administration.  Members included [[Buzz Aldrin]], General Daniel Graham, rocket engineer Max Hunter, North American VP and Space Shuttle manager George Merrick, and other aerospace industry leaders. Policy recommendations from the Council included ballistic missile defense concepts which were later transformed into what was called the Strategic Defense Initiative by those who favored it, and \"Star Wars\" as a term of derision coined by Senator [[Ted Kennedy]]. Heinlein assisted with Council contribution to the Reagan \"Star Wars\" speech of Spring 1983.\n\nAsked to appear before a [[joint committee|Joint Committee]] of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] that year, he testified on his belief that [[Government spin-off|spin-offs]] from [[space technology]] were benefiting the infirm and the elderly.  Heinlein's surgical treatment re-energized him, and he wrote five novels from 1980 until he died in his sleep from [[emphysema]] and heart failure on May 8, 1988.\n\nAt that time, he had been putting together the early notes for another ''[[World as Myth]]'' novel.  Several of his other works have been published posthumously.<ref>Based on an outline and notes created by Heinlein in 1955, [[Spider Robinson]] has written the novel ''[[Variable Star]]''.

The novels ''Podkayne of Mars'' and ''[[Red Planet (novel)|Red Planet]]'', which were edited against his wishes in their original release, have been reissued in restored editions.  ''Stranger In a Strange Land'' was originally published in a shorter form, but both the long and short versions are now simultaneously available in print.</ref>\n\nAfter his death, his wife Virginia Heinlein issued a compilation of Heinlein's correspondence and notes into a somewhat autobiographical examination of his career, published in 1989 under the title ''Grumbles from the Grave''.

In 1940, the year after selling 'Life-Line' to Campbell, he wrote three short novels, four novelettes, and seven short stories. They went on to say that \"No one ever dominated the science fiction field as Bob did in the first few years of his career.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.panshin.com/critics/Dream/dream1.html|title=The Death of Science Fiction: A Dream, Part 1|last=Panshin|first=Alexei and Cory|website=www.panshin.com|access-date=August 28, 2016}}</ref> Alexei expresses awe in Heinlein's ability to show readers a world so drastically different from the one we live in now, yet have so many similarities. He says that \"We find ourselves not only in a world other than our own, but identifying with a living, breathing individual who is operating within its context, and thinking and acting according to its terms.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.panshin.com/critics/Golden/goldenage1.html|title=Heinlein and the Golden Age, 1|last=Panshin|first=Alexei|website=www.panshin.com|access-date=August 28, 2016}}</ref>\n[[File:Two complete science adventure books 1952win n7.jpg|thumb|right|Heinlein's 1942 novel ''[[Beyond This Horizon]]'' was reprinted in ''[[Two Complete Science-Adventure Books]]'' in 1952, appearing under the \"Anson McDonald\" byline even though the book edition had been published under Heinlein's own name four years earlier]]\n[[File:Galaxy 195109.jpg|thumb|right|The opening installment of ''The Puppet Masters'' took the cover of the September 1951 issue of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]''.]]\n\nThe first novel that Heinlein wrote, ''[[For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs]]'' (1939), did not see print during his lifetime, but Robert James tracked down the manuscript and it was published in 2003.

In a review of it, [[John Clute]] wrote: \"I'm not about to suggest that if Heinlein had been able to publish [such works] openly in the pages of Astounding in 1939, SF would have gotten the future right; I would suggest, however, that if Heinlein, and his colleagues, had been able to publish adult SF in Astounding and its fellow journals, then SF might not have done such a grotesquely poor job of prefiguring something of the flavor of actually living here at the onset of 2004.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nielsenhayden.com/electrolite/archives/004356.html|title=Electrolite: \"He was the train we did not catch.\"|website=nielsenhayden.com|access-date=August 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''For Us, the Living'' was intriguing as a window into the development of Heinlein's radical ideas about man as a [[social animal]], including his interest in [[free love]].  The root of many themes found in his later stories can be found in this book.  It also contained a large amount of material that could be considered background for his other novels. This included a detailed description of the protagonist's treatment to avoid being banned to [[Coventry (short story)|Coventry]] (a lawless land in the Heinlein mythos where unrepentant law-breakers are exiled).{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n[[File:Robert Heinlein Amazing 5304.jpg|thumb|left|Heinlein as depicted in ''Amazing Stories'' in 1953]]\n\nIt appears that Heinlein at least attempted to live in a manner consistent with these ideals, even in the 1930s, and had an [[open relationship]] in his marriage to his second wife, Leslyn.  He was also a [[Naturism|nudist]];<ref name=\"hine-line_soc\"/> nudism and body [[taboo]]s are frequently discussed in his work.  At the height of the [[Cold War]], he built a [[air-raid shelter|bomb shelter]] under his house, like the one featured in ''[[Farnham's Freehold]]''.<ref name=\"hine-line_soc\"/>\n\nAfter ''For Us, The Living'', Heinlein began selling (to magazines) first short stories, then novels, set in a [[Future History (novel)|Future History]], complete with a time line of significant political, cultural, and technological changes.  A chart of the future history was published in the May 1941 issue of ''Astounding''.  Over time, Heinlein wrote many novels and short stories that deviated freely from the Future History on some points, while maintaining consistency in some other areas. The Future History was eventually overtaken by actual events.  These discrepancies were explained, after a fashion, in his later World as Myth stories.\n\nHeinlein's first novel published as a book, ''[[Rocket Ship Galileo]]'', was initially rejected because going to the moon was considered too far-fetched, but he soon found a publisher, [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]], that began publishing a Heinlein [[young adult literature|juvenile]] once a year for the Christmas season.<ref>Robert A.

Many of these were first published in serial form under other titles, e.g., ''Farmer in the Sky'' was published as ''Satellite Scout'' in the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] magazine ''[[Boys' Life]]''.  There has been speculation that Heinlein's intense obsession with his privacy was due at least in part to the apparent contradiction between his unconventional private life and his career as an author of books for children. However, ''For Us, The Living'' explicitly discusses the political importance Heinlein attached to privacy as a matter of principle thus negating this line of reasoning.<ref>The importance Heinlein attached to privacy was made clear in his fiction, ''e.g.'', ''For Us, the Living'', but also in several well-known examples from his life.  He had a falling out with [[Alexei Panshin]], who wrote an important book analyzing Heinlein's fiction; Heinlein stopped cooperating with Panshin because he accused Panshin of \"[attempting to] pry into his affairs and to violate his privacy.\"  Heinlein wrote to Panshin's publisher threatening to sue, and stating, \"You are warned that only the barest facts of my private life are public knowledge&nbsp;...\" [http://www.panshin.com/critics/StoryHiD/HiDF.htm Enter.net].  In his 1961 guest of honor speech at Seacon, the [[Worldcon]] in Seattle, he advocated building bomb shelters and caching away unregistered weapons, [http://www.panshin.com/critics/Perry/perryA.htm Enter.net] and his own house in Colorado Springs included a bomb shelter.  Heinlein was a nudist, and built a fence around his house in Santa Cruz to keep out the counterculture types who had learned of his ideas through ''Stranger in a Strange Land''.  In his later life, Heinlein studiously avoided revealing his early involvement in left-wing politics, [http://www.panshin.com/critics/Perry/perryA.htm Enter.net], and made strenuous efforts to block publication of information he had revealed to prospective biographer Sam Moskowitz.[http://www.panshin.com/critics/Perry/perryA.htm Enter.net]</ref>\n\nThe novels that Heinlein wrote for a young audience are commonly called \"the Heinlein juveniles\", and they feature a mixture of adolescent and adult themes.  Many of the issues that he takes on in these books have to do with the kinds of problems that adolescents experience. His protagonists are usually very intelligent teenagers who have to make their way in the adult society they see around them. On the surface, they are simple tales of adventure, achievement, and dealing with stupid teachers and jealous peers. Heinlein was a vocal proponent of the notion that juvenile readers were far more sophisticated and able to handle more complex or difficult themes than most people realized. His juvenile stories often had a maturity to them that made them readable for adults. ''[[Red Planet (novel)|Red Planet]]'', for example, portrays some very subversive themes, including a revolution in which young students are involved; his editor demanded substantial changes in this book's discussion of topics such as the use of weapons by children and the misidentified sex of the Martian character. Heinlein was always aware of the editorial limitations put in place by the editors of his novels and stories, and while he observed those restrictions on the surface, was often successful in introducing ideas not often seen in other authors' juvenile SF.\n\nIn 1957, [[James Blish]] wrote that one reason for Heinlein's success \"has been the high grade of machinery which goes, today as always, into his story-telling.  Heinlein seems to have known from the beginning, as if instinctively, technical lessons about fiction which other writers must learn the hard way (or often enough, never learn).  He does not always operate the machinery to the best advantage, but he always seems to be aware of it.\"<ref>[[James Blish]], ''The Issues at Hand'', page 52.</ref>\n\n===1959\u20131960===\nHeinlein decisively ended his juvenile novels with ''[[Starship Troopers]]'' (1959), a controversial work and his personal riposte to leftists calling for President [[Dwight D.

This is presented in the novel as an outgrowth of the failure of unearned suffrage government and as a very successful arrangement. In addition, the franchise was only awarded after leaving the assigned service, thus those serving their terms\u2014in the military, or any other service\u2014were excluded from exercising any franchise. Career military were completely disenfranchised until retirement.\n\nThe name ''Starship Troopers'' was licensed for an unrelated, [[B movie]] script called ''Bug Hunt at Outpost Nine'', which was then retitled to benefit from the book's credibility.<ref>[http://www.fangoria.com/new/fango-flashback-starship-troopers-1997/ Fango Flashback: \"STARSHIP TROOPERS\" (1997)]<br/>Verhoeven went returned to genre territory, optioning a script from his ''Robocop'' collaborator Ed Neumeier entitled ''Bug Hunt at Outpost 9'' 9 and refashioning it with elements from Robert Heinlein's ''Starship Troopers''.

Fans of Heinlein were critical of the movie, which they considered a betrayal of Heinlein's philosophy, presenting the society in which the story takes place as [[fascist]].<ref name=Disastrous>{{cite web|title=Heinlein: Starship Troopers\u2014A Disastrous Film Adaptation|url=http://blogcritics.org/books/article/heinlein-starship-troopersa-disastrous-film-adaptation/}}</ref>\n\nLikewise, the [[powered armor]] technology that is not only central to the book, but became a standard subgenre of science fiction thereafter, is completely absent in the movie, where the characters use [[World War II]]-technology weapons and wear light combat gear little more advanced than that.<ref>[http://thehollywoodinterview.blogspot.com/2010/09/paul-verhoeven-starship-troopers.html How Did Verhoeven Manage to Ruin Starship Troopers So Completely?]</ref>\n\nIn Verhoeven's movie of the same name, there is no battle armor. Verhoeven commented that he had tried to read the book after he had bought the rights to it, in order to add it to his existing movie.

Critics William H. Patterson, Jr., and Andrew Thornton believe that this is simply an expression of Heinlein's longstanding philosophical opposition to [[Positivism (philosophy)|positivism]].<ref>Patterson, William H.; Thornton, Andrew.

The penultimate novel of this period, ''I Will Fear No Evil'', is according to critic James Gifford \"almost universally regarded as a literary failure\"<ref>Gifford, James. ''Robert A. Heinlein: A Reader's Companion'', Nitrosyncretic Press, Sacramento, California, 2000, p. 102.</ref> and he attributes its shortcomings to Heinlein's near-death from [[peritonitis]].\n\n===Later work, 1980\u20131987===\nAfter a seven-year hiatus brought on by poor health, Heinlein produced five new novels in the period from 1980 (''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'') to 1987 (''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]''). These books have a thread of common characters and time and place. They most explicitly communicated Heinlein's philosophies and beliefs, and many long, didactic passages of dialog and exposition deal with government, sex, and religion. These novels are controversial among his readers and one critic, [[David Langford]], has written about them very negatively.<ref>See, e.g., [http://www.ansible.co.uk/writing/numbeast.html Review of Vulgarity and Nullity] by Dave Langford. Retrieved July 6, 2007.</ref> Heinlein's four Hugo awards were all for books written before this period.\n\nSome of these books, such as ''The Number of the Beast'' and ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]'', start out as tightly constructed adventure stories, but transform into philosophical fantasias at the end. It is a matter of opinion whether this demonstrates a lack of attention to craftsmanship or a conscious effort to expand the boundaries of science fiction, either into a kind of [[magic realism|magical realism]], continuing the process of literary exploration that he had begun with ''Stranger in a Strange Land'', or into a kind of literary metaphor of [[quantum]] science (''The Number of the Beast'' dealing with the Observer problem, and ''The Cat Who Walks Through Walls'' being a direct reference to the [[Schr\u00f6dinger's cat]] thought experiment).\n\nMost of the novels from this period are recognized by critics as forming an offshoot from the Future History series, and referred to by the term World as Myth.<ref>William H. Patterson, Jr., and Andrew Thornton, The Martian Named Smith: Critical Perspectives on Robert A. Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land, p. 128:  \"His books written after about 1980&nbsp;... belong to a series called by one of the central characters ''World as Myth''.\" The term Multiverse also occurs in the print literature, e.g., Robert A. Heinlein: A Reader's Companion, James Gifford, Nitrosyncretic Press, Sacramento, California, 2000. The term World as Myth occurs for the first time in Heinlein's novel ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]''.</ref>\n\nThe tendency toward authorial self-reference begun in ''Stranger in a Strange Land'' and ''Time Enough for Love'' becomes even more evident in novels such as ''The Cat Who Walks Through Walls'', whose first-person protagonist is a disabled military veteran who becomes a writer, and finds love with a female character.<ref name=\"Robert A.

It concludes with a traditional Heinlein note, as in ''The Moon is a Harsh Mistress'' or ''Time Enough for Love'', that freedom is to be found on the frontiers.\n\nThe 1984 novel ''[[Job: A Comedy of Justice]]'' is a sharp satire of organized religion.

Many were seen as radical or as ahead of their time in their social criticism.  His books have inspired considerable debate about the specifics, and the evolution, of Heinlein's own opinions, and have earned him both lavish praise and a degree of criticism.

Roosevelt]]'s [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] translated into outer space.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nHeinlein's fiction of the 1940s and 1950s, however, began to espouse [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] views. After 1945, he came to believe that a strong [[world government]] was the only way to avoid [[mutual assured destruction|mutual nuclear annihilation]].  His 1949 novel ''[[Space Cadet]]'' describes a future scenario where a military-controlled global government enforces world peace. Heinlein ceased considering himself a Democrat in 1954.<ref name=Wooster/>\n\nHeinlein considered himself a libertarian, but in a letter to Judith Merril in 1967 (never sent) he also described himself as a [[philosophical anarchist]] or an \"[[Autarchism|autarchist]]\" <ref>Patterson, William (2014).

His early juveniles were very much ahead of their time both in their explicit rejection of racism and in their inclusion of protagonists of color\u2014in the context of science fiction before the 1960s, the mere existence of characters of color was a remarkable novelty, with green occurring more often than brown.<ref>Pearson, Wendy. \"Race relations\" in, ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders, Volume 2'' Gary Westfahl, ed.; Westport, Connecticut: [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], 2005; pp. 648\u201350</ref> For example, his second juvenile, the 1948 ''Space Cadet'', explicitly uses aliens as a metaphor for minorities.

The most telling clues are Rod's comments about Caroline Mshiyeni being similar to his sister, and the 'obvious' (to all of the other characters) pairing of Rod and Caroline.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=J.

The most prominent and controversial example is ''[[Farnham's Freehold]]'', which casts a [[white (people)|white]] family into a future in which white people are the slaves of cannibalistic black rulers.  In the 1941 novel ''[[Sixth Column]]'' (also known as ''The Day After Tomorrow''), a white resistance movement in the United States defends itself against an invasion by an Asian fascist state (the \"Pan-Asians\") using a \"super-science\" technology that allows ray weapons to be tuned to specific races.  The book is sprinkled with racist slurs against Asian people, and blacks and Hispanics are not mentioned at all. The idea for the story was pushed on Heinlein by editor [[John W. Campbell]], and Heinlein wrote later that he had \"had to re-slant it to remove racist aspects of the original story line\" and that he did not \"consider it to be an artistic success.\"<ref>Robert A.

Heinlein, ''Expanded Universe'', p. 396 of Ace paperback edition.</ref> Heinlein suggests in the book that the Bugs are a good example of Communism being something that humans cannot successfully adhere to, since humans are strongly defined individuals, whereas the Bugs, being a collective, can all contribute to the whole without consideration of individual desire.<ref>Robert A. Heinlein, ''Starship Troopers'', p. 121 of Berkley Medallion paperback edition.</ref>\n\nHeinlein's biographer William Patterson <ref>Patterson, op. cit., passim (especially Volume 2).</ref> relates a number of instances in which Heinlein responded to [[anti-semitic]] remarks by falsely claiming to be half-[[Jewish]] himself and breaking off all further contact with anti-semites. Heinlein's actual ancestry is [[German-American]] on his father's side and [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] American on his mother's side, both going back to the Colonial era in the United States.\n\n===Individualism and self-determination===\nIn keeping with his belief in [[individualism]], his work for adults\u2014and sometimes even his work for juveniles\u2014often portrays both the oppressors and the oppressed with considerable ambiguity.  Heinlein believed that individualism was incompatible with ignorance. He believed that an appropriate level of adult competence was achieved through a wide-ranging education, whether this occurred in a classroom or not. In his juvenile novels, more than once a character looks with disdain at a student's choice of classwork, saying, \"Why didn't you study something useful?\"<ref>For example, recruitment officer Mr Weiss, in ''Starship Troopers'' (p. 37, New English Library: London, 1977 edition.)</ref> In ''Time Enough for Love'', [[Lazarus Long]] gives a long [[Competent Man|list of capabilities]] that anyone should have, concluding, \"Specialization is for insects.\" The ability of the individual to create himself is explored in stories such as ''[[I Will Fear No Evil]]'', \"{{'}}[[\u2014All You Zombies\u2014]]{{'}}\", and \"[[By His Bootstraps]]\".\n\n===Sexual issues===\nFor Heinlein, personal liberation included [[sexual liberation]], and [[free love]] was a major subject of his writing starting in 1939, with ''For Us, The Living''. During his early period, Heinlein's writing for younger readers needed to take account of both editorial perceptions of sexuality in his novels, and potential perceptions among the buying public; as critic William H. Patterson has put it, his dilemma was \"to sort out what was really objectionable from what was only excessive over-sensitivity to imaginary librarians\".<ref>William H Patterson jnr's ''Introduction'' to ''The Rolling Stones'', Baen: New York, 2009 edition., p. 3.</ref>\nBy his middle period, sexual freedom and the elimination of sexual jealousy were a major theme of ''Stranger in a Strange Land'' (1961), in which the progressively minded but sexually conservative reporter, Ben Caxton, acts as a [[foil (literature)|dramatic foil]] for the less parochial characters, [[Jubal Harshaw]] and Valentine Michael Smith (Mike). Another of the main characters, Jill, is homophobic.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jan/12/heinlein-hugo-stranger-strange-land |title=Robert Heinlein's softer side |first=Sam |last=Jordison |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |agency=Books Blog |date=January 12, 2009 |accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nGary Westfahl points out that \"Heinlein is a problematic case for feminists; on the one hand, his works often feature strong female characters and vigorous statements that women are equal to or even superior to men; but these characters and statements often reflect hopelessly stereotypical attitudes about typical female attributes. It is disconcerting, for example, that in ''Expanded Universe'' Heinlein calls for a society where all lawyers and politicians are women, essentially on the grounds that they possess a mysterious feminine practicality that men cannot duplicate.\"<ref>Gary Westfahl, \"Superladies in Waiting: How the Female Hero Almost Emerges in Science Fiction\", ''Foundation'', vol. 58, 1993, pp. 42\u201362.</ref>\n\nIn books written as early as 1956, Heinlein dealt with incest and the sexual nature of children.  Many of his books including ''[[Time for the Stars]]'', ''[[Glory Road]]'', ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'', and ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'' dealt explicitly or implicitly with incest, sexual feelings and relations between adults and children, or both.<ref name=\"The Heinlein Society\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heinleinsociety.org/rah/works/articles/Parenting.html |title=The Heinlein Society |publisher=The Heinlein Society |accessdate=May 16, 2012}}</ref> The treatment of these themes include the romantic relationship and eventual marriage, once the girl becomes an adult via time-travel, of a 30-year-old engineer and an 11-year-old girl in ''[[The Door into Summer]]'' or the more overt intra-familial incest in ''To Sail Beyond the Sunset'' and ''Farnham's Freehold''.  Peers such as [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Damon Knight]] have commented critically on Heinlein's portrayal of incest and pedophilia in a lighthearted and even approving manner.<ref name=\"The Heinlein Society\"/>\n\n===Philosophy===\nIn ''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]'', Heinlein has the main character, [[Maureen Johnson (Heinlein character)|Maureen]], state that the purpose of [[metaphysics]] is to ask questions:  Why are we here?  Where are we going after we die? (and so on), and that you are not allowed to answer the questions. ''Asking'' the questions is the point of metaphysics, but ''answering'' them is not, because once you answer this kind of question, you cross the line into religion. Maureen does not state a reason for this; she simply remarks that such questions are \"beautiful\" but lack answers. Maureen's son/lover Lazarus Long makes a related remark in ''Time Enough for Love''. In order for us to answer the \"big questions\" about the universe, Lazarus states at one point, it would be necessary to stand ''outside'' the universe.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, Heinlein was deeply interested in [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s [[General Semantics]] and attended a number of seminars on the subject. His views on [[epistemology]] seem to have flowed from that interest, and his fictional characters continue to express Korzybskian views to the very end of his writing career. Many of his stories, such as ''[[Gulf (Heinlein)|Gulf]]'', ''[[If This Goes On\u2014]]'', and ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'', depend strongly on the premise, related to the well-known [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir\u2013Whorf hypothesis]], that by using a correctly [[constructed language|designed language]], one can change or improve oneself mentally, or even realize untapped potential (as in the case of Joe Green in ''Gulf'').{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nWhen [[Ayn Rand]]'s novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' was published, Heinlein was very favorably impressed, as quoted in \"Grumbles&nbsp;...\" and mentioned John Galt\u2014the hero in Rand's ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''\u2014as a heroic archetype in ''The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress''.  He was also strongly affected by the religious philosopher [[P. D. Ouspensky]].<ref name=\"aolbio\"/> [[Sigmund Freud|Freudianism]] and [[psychoanalysis]] were at the height of their influence during the peak of Heinlein's career, and stories such as ''[[Time for the Stars]]''  indulged in psychological theorizing.\n\nHowever, he was skeptical about Freudianism, especially after a struggle with an editor who insisted on reading Freudian sexual symbolism into his [[Young-adult fiction|juvenile novels]]. Heinlein was fascinated by the [[social credit]] movement in the 1930s. This is shown in ''[[Beyond This Horizon]]'' and in his 1938 novel ''[[For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs]]'', which was finally published in 2003, long after his death. He was strongly committed to [[cultural relativism]], and the sociologist Margaret Mader in his novel ''[[Citizen of the Galaxy]]'' is clearly a reference to [[Margaret Mead]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n====Pay it forward====\nThe term \"[[pay it forward]]\", though it was already in occasional use as a quotation, was popularized by Robert A. Heinlein in his book ''[[Between Planets]]'', published in 1951:\n\n{{quotation|The banker reached into the folds of his gown, pulled out a single credit note. \"But eat first\u2014a full belly steadies the judgment. Do me the honor of accepting this as our welcome to the newcomer.\"\n\nHis pride said no; his stomach said YES! Don took it and said, \"Uh, thanks! That's awfully kind of you. I'll pay it back, first chance.\"\n\n\"Instead, pay it forward to some other brother who needs it.\"}}\n\nHeinlein was a mentor to [[Ray Bradbury]], giving him help and quite possibly passing on the concept, made famous by the publication of a letter from him to Heinlein thanking him. In Bradbury's novel ''[[Dandelion Wine]]'', published in 1957, when the main character Douglas Spaulding is reflecting on his life being saved by Mr. Jonas, the Junkman:\n\n{{quotation|How do I thank Mr. Jonas, he wondered, for what he's done?  How do I thank him, how pay him back? No way, no way at all. You just can't pay. What then? What? Pass it on somehow, he thought, pass it on to someone else. Keep the chain moving. Look around, find someone, and pass it on. That was the only way&nbsp;...}}\n\nBradbury has also advised that writers he has helped thank him by helping other writers.\n\nHeinlein both preached and practiced this philosophy; now the [[Robert A. Heinlein#Heinlein Society|Heinlein Society]], a humanitarian organization founded in his name, does so, attributing the philosophy to its various efforts, including Heinlein for Heroes, the Heinlein Society Scholarship Program, and Heinlein Society blood drives.<ref>[http://www.heinleinsociety.org/pay-it-forward/ Pay it Forward \u2014 Heinlein Society]<br/>The most important aspect of Robert Heinlein's legacy that we at The Heinlein Society support and adhere to is his concept of paying it forward.</ref>\nAuthor Spider Robinson made repeated reference to the doctrine, attributing it to his spiritual mentor Heinlein.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.heinleinsociety.org/CentennialReader/heinleinsociety.html |title = The Heinlein Society }}</ref>\n\n==Influence and legacy==\n\n===The Dean of Science Fiction===\nHeinlein is usually identified, along with [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]], as one of the three masters of science fiction to arise in the so-called [[Golden Age of science fiction]], associated with [[John W. Campbell]] and his magazine ''[[Astounding (magazine)|Astounding]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Freedman\n| first = Carl\n| author-link = Carl Freedman\n| title = Critical Theory and Science Fiction\n| publisher=Doubleday\n| year = 2000\n| pages = 71\n| postscript = <!--None-->\n}}</ref>\nIn the 1950s he was a leader in bringing science fiction out of the low-paying and less prestigious \"[[pulp magazine|pulp]] ghetto\".  Most of his works, including short stories, have been continuously in print in many languages since their initial appearance and are still available as new paperbacks decades after his death.\n\nRobert Heinlein was also influenced by the [[American literature|American writer]], philosopher and humorist [[Charles Fort]] who is credited as a major influence on most of the leading science-fiction writers of the 20th-century. Heinlein was a lifelong member of the [[International Fortean Organization]] also known as [[INFO]], the successor to the original [[Fortean Society]].  Heinlein's letters were often displayed on the walls of the INFO offices, and his active participation in the organization is mentioned in the INFO Journal.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n[[File:heinlein-crater.jpg|thumb|[[Heinlein crater]] on [[Mars]].]]\n\nHe was at the top of his form during, and himself helped to initiate, the trend toward [[social science fiction]], which went along with a general maturing of the genre away from [[space opera]] to a more literary approach touching on such adult issues as politics and [[human sexuality]].  In reaction to this trend, [[hard science fiction]] began to be distinguished as a separate subgenre, but paradoxically Heinlein is also considered a seminal figure in hard science fiction, due to his extensive knowledge of engineering, and the careful scientific research demonstrated in his stories.  Heinlein himself stated\u2014with obvious pride\u2014that in the days before pocket calculators, he and his wife Virginia once worked for several days on a mathematical equation describing an Earth-Mars rocket orbit, which was then subsumed in a single sentence of the novel ''Space Cadet''.\n\n===Influence among writers===\n\nHeinlein has had a nearly ubiquitous influence on other science fiction writers.  In a 1953 poll of leading science fiction authors, he was cited more frequently as an influence than any other modern writer.<ref>Panshin, p. 3, describing de Camp's Science Fiction Handbook</ref> Critic James Gifford writes that \"Although many other writers have exceeded Heinlein's output, few can claim to match his broad and seminal influence.  Scores of science fiction writers from the prewar Golden Age through the present day loudly and enthusiastically credit Heinlein for blazing the trails of their own careers, and shaping their styles and stories.\"<ref>''Robert A. Heinlein: A Reader's Companion'', p. xiii.</ref>\n\nWriter [[David Gerrold]], responsible for creating the tribbles in Star Trek, also credited Heinlein as the inspiration for his [[The Dingilliad|''Dingilliad'']] series of novels. [[Gregory Benford]] refers to his novel Jupiter Project as a Heinlein tribute. Similarly, [[Charles Stross]] says his Hugo Award-nominated novel [[Saturn's Children (novel)|''Saturn's Children'']] is \"a space opera and late-period Robert A. Heinlein tribute\",<ref>[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/fiction/faq.html The Charles Stross FAQ]</ref> referring to Heinlein's ''[[Friday (novel)|Friday]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/08/interview-1.html#comment-57213 |title=Interview - Charlie's Diary |publisher=Antipope.org |date=August 27, 2010 |accessdate=August 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Words and phrases coined===\n\nOutside the science fiction community, several words and phrases coined or adopted by Heinlein have passed into common English usage:\n* [[wikt:waldo|Waldo]], protagonist in the eponymous short story \"[[Waldo (short story)|Waldo]]\" whose name came to mean mechanical/robot arms in the real world that are akin to the ones used by the character in the story.\n* [[TANSTAAFL]], short for There Ain't No Such Thing as a Free Lunch, an existing term that refers to the fact that things supposedly given free always have some real cost, popularized in ''[[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]''.\n* [[Moonbat]]<ref>[[The New York Times Magazine]], ''On Language'', by [[William Safire]], September 3, 2006</ref> used in [[United States politics]] as a pejorative political [[epithet]] referring to progressives or [[leftists]], was originally the name of a space ship in his story ''[[Space Jockey]]''.\n* [[Grok]], a \"Martian\" word for understanding a thing so fully as to become one with it, from ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]''.\n* [[Space Marine]], an existing term popularized by Heinlein in short stories, the concept then being made famous by ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', though the term \"space marine\" is not used in that novel.\n* [[Speculative fiction]], a term Heinlein used for the separation of serious, consistent Science Fiction writing, from the pop \"sci fi\" of the day, which generally took great artistic license with human knowledge, amounting to being more like space fantasy than ''science'' fiction.\n\n===Inspiring culture and technology===\n\nIn 1962, [[Oberon Zell-Ravenheart]] (then still using his birth name, Tim Zell) founded the [[Church of All Worlds]], a [[Neopagan]] religious organization modeled in many ways after the treatment of religion in the novel ''Stranger in a Strange Land''.  This spiritual path included several ideas from the book, including non-mainstream family structures, social libertarianism, water-sharing rituals, an acceptance of all religious paths by a single tradition, and the use of several terms such as \"grok\", \"Thou art God\", and \"Never Thirst\".  Though Heinlein was neither a member nor a promoter of the Church, there was a frequent exchange of correspondence between Zell and Heinlein, and he was a paid subscriber to their magazine, ''[[Green Egg]]''.  This Church still exists as a 501(C)(3) religious organization incorporated in California, with membership worldwide, and it remains an active part of the neopagan community today.<ref>[http://original.caw.org Church Of All Worlds]</ref>\n\nHeinlein was influential in making [[space exploration]] seem to the public more like a practical possibility.  His stories in publications such as ''The Saturday Evening Post'' took a matter-of-fact approach to their outer-space setting, rather than the \"gee whiz\" tone that had previously been common.  The documentary-like film ''[[Destination Moon (film)|Destination Moon]]'' advocated a [[Space Race]] with an unspecified foreign power almost a decade before such an idea became commonplace, and was promoted by an unprecedented publicity campaign in print publications.  Many of the astronauts and others working in the U.S. space program grew up on a diet of the Heinlein [[young adult literature|juveniles]],{{Original research inline|date=October 2010}} best evidenced by the naming of a crater on Mars after him, and a tribute interspersed by the [[Apollo 15]] astronauts into their radio conversations while on the moon.<ref>[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/a15.clsout3.html#1675120 The Hammer and the Feather].
