The closest shell to the nucleus is called the \"{{serif|1}} shell\" (also called \"K shell\"), followed by the \"{{serif|2}} shell\" (or \"L shell\"), then the \"{{serif|3}} shell\" (or \"M shell\"), and so on farther and farther from the nucleus. The shells correspond with the [[principal quantum number]]s (''n'' = 1, 2, 3, 4&nbsp;...) or are labeled alphabetically with letters used in the [[X-ray notation]] (K, L, M,&nbsp;\u2026).\n\nEach shell can contain only a fixed number of electrons: The first shell can hold up to two electrons, the second shell can hold up to eight (2 + 6) electrons, the third shell can hold up to 18 (2 + 6 + 10) and so on. The general formula is that the ''n''th shell can in principle hold up to 2([[square number|''n''<sup>2</sup>]]) electrons.<ref name=\"madsci\">[http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/1999-03/921736624.Ch.r.html Re: Why do electron shells have set limits ?] madsci.org, 17 March 1999, Dan Berger, Faculty Chemistry/Science, Bluffton College</ref> Since electrons are [[electrostatic field|electrically attracted]] to the nucleus, an atom's electrons will generally occupy outer shells only if the more inner shells have already been completely filled by other electrons. However, this is not a strict requirement: atoms may have two or even three incomplete outer shells. (See [[Aufbau principle|Madelung rule]] for more details.) For an explanation of why electrons exist in these shells see [[electron configuration]].<ref name=\"corrosionsource.com\">[http://www.corrosionsource.com/handbook/periodic/e_subshells.htm Electron Subshells]. Corrosion Source. Retrieved on 1 December 2011.</ref>\n\nThe electrons in the outermost occupied shell (or shells) determine the chemical properties of the atom; it is called the ''valence shell''.\n\nEach shell consists of one or more ''subshells'', and each subshell consists of one or more [[atomic orbital]]s.\n\n==History==\nThe shell terminology comes from [[Arnold Sommerfeld]]'s modification of the [[Bohr model]]. Sommerfeld retained Bohr's planetary model, but added mildly elliptical orbits (characterized by additional [[quantum number]]s ''{{ell}}'' and ''m'') to explain the fine [[atomic spectrum|spectroscopic structure]] of some elements.<ref>Donald Sadoway, ''Introduction to Solid State Chemistry'', [http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-091-introduction-to-solid-state-chemistry-fall-2004/video-lectures/embed05/ Lecture 5]</ref> The multiple electrons with the same principal quantum number (''n'') had close orbits that formed a \"shell\" of positive thickness instead of the infinitely thin circular orbit of Bohr's model.\n\nThe existence of electron shells was first observed experimentally in [[Charles Barkla]]'s and [[Henry Moseley]]'s [[X-ray]] absorption studies. Barkla labeled them with the letters K, L, M, N, O, P, and Q.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14786440908637137 |quote=\"Previously denoted by letters B and A (...). The letters K and L are, however, preferable, as it is highly probable that series of radiations both more absorbable and more penetrating exist.\"|title=XXXIX.The spectra of the fluorescent R\u00f6ntgen radiations|journal=Philosophical Magazine Series 6|volume=22|issue=129|pages=396|year=1911|last1=Barkla|first1=Charles G.}}</ref> The origin of this terminology was alphabetic. A \"J\" series was also suspected, though later experiments indicated that the K absorption lines are produced by the innermost electrons. These letters were later found to correspond to the [[principal quantum number|''n'' values]] 1, 2, 3, etc. They are used in the spectroscopic [[Siegbahn notation]].\n\nThe [[physical chemist]] [[Gilbert Newton Lewis|Gilbert Lewis]] was responsible for much of the early development of the theory of the participation of valence shell electrons in chemical bonding. [[Linus Pauling]] later generalized and extended the theory while applying insights from [[quantum mechanics]].\n\n==Shells==\nThe electron shells are labeled K, L, M, N, O, P, and Q; or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7; going from innermost shell outwards. Electrons in outer shells have higher average energy and travel farther from the nucleus than those in inner shells. This makes them more important in determining how the atom reacts chemically and behaves as a conductor, because the pull of the atom's nucleus upon them is weaker and more easily broken. In this way, a given element's reactivity is highly dependent upon its electronic configuration.\n\n==Subshells==\nEach shell is composed of one or more subshells, which are themselves composed of [[atomic orbital]]s. For example, the first (K) shell has one subshell, called {{serif|1s}}; the second (L) shell has two subshells, called {{serif|2s}} and {{serif|2p}}; the third shell has {{serif|3s}}, {{serif|3p}}, and {{serif|3d}}; the fourth shell has {{serif|4s}}, {{serif|4p}}, {{serif|4d}} and {{serif|4f}}; the fifth shell has {{serif|5s}}, {{serif|5p}}, {{serif|5d}}, and {{serif|5f}} and can theoretically hold more but the {{serif|5f}} subshell, although partially occupied in [[actinide]]s, is not filled in any element occurring naturally.<ref name=\"corrosionsource.com\"/> The various possible subshells are shown in the following table:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

For example, the \"{{serif|4s}} subshell\" is a subshell of the fourth (N) shell, with the type ({{serif|s}}) described in the first row.\n* The second column is the [[azimuthal quantum number]] (\u2113) of the subshell. The precise definition involves [[quantum mechanics]], but it is a number that characterizes the subshell.\n* The third column is the maximum number of electrons that can be put into a subshell of that type. For example, the top row says that each {{serif|s}}-type subshell ({{serif|1s}}, {{serif|2s}}, etc.) can have at most two electrons in it. In each case the figure is 4 greater than the one above it.\n* The fourth column says which shells have a subshell of that type. For example, looking at the top two rows, every shell has an {{serif|s}} subshell, while only the second shell and higher have a {{serif|p}} subshell (i.e., there is no \"1p\" subshell).\n* The final column gives the historical origin of the labels {{serif|s}}, {{serif|p}}, {{serif|d}}, and {{serif|f}}. They come from early studies of [[atomic spectral line]]s. The other labels, namely {{serif|g}}, {{serif|h}} and {{serif|i}}, are an alphabetic continuation following the last historically originated label of {{serif|f}}.\n\nAlthough it is commonly stated that all the electrons in a shell have the same energy, this is an approximation. However, the electrons in one ''subshell'' do have exactly the same level of energy,<ref>The statement that the electrons in one subshell have exactly the same level of energy is true in an isolated atom, where it follows quantum-mechanically from the [[spherical symmetry]] of the system. When the atom is part of a molecule, this no longer holds; see, for example, [[crystal field theory]].</ref> with later subshells having more energy per electron than earlier ones. This effect is great enough that the energy ranges associated with shells can overlap (see ''[[valence shell]]s'' and ''[[Aufbau principle]]'').\n\n==Number of electrons in each shell==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Shell<br>name!!Subshell<br>name!!Subshell<br>max<br>electrons!!Shell<br>max<br>electrons\n|-\n|K||{{serif|1s}}||2||'''2'''\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|L\n|{{serif|2s}}\n|2\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2 + 6 = '''8'''\n|-\n|{{serif|2p}}\n|6\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|M\n|{{serif|3s}}\n|2\n|rowspan=\"3\"|2 + 6 + 10<br>= '''18'''\n|-\n|{{serif|3p}}\n|6\n|-\n|{{serif|3d}}\n|10\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|N\n|{{serif|4s}}\n|2\n|rowspan=\"4\"|2 + 6 +<br> 10 + 14<br>= '''32'''\n|-\n|{{serif|4p}}\n|6\n|-\n|{{serif|4d}}\n|10\n|-\n|{{serif|4f}}\n|14\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|O\n|{{serif|5s}}\n|2\n|rowspan=\"5\"|2 + 6 +<br> 10 + 14 +<br> 18 = '''50'''\n|-\n|{{serif|5p}}\n|6\n|-\n|{{serif|5d}}\n|10\n|-\n|{{serif|5f}}\n|14\n|-\n|{{serif|5g}}\n|18\n|}\n\nEach subshell is constrained to hold {{math|4''{{ell}}'' '''+''' 2}} electrons at most, namely:\n* Each {{serif|s}} subshell holds at most 2 electrons\n* Each {{serif|p}} subshell holds at most 6 electrons\n* Each {{serif|d}} subshell holds at most 10 electrons\n* Each {{serif|f}} subshell holds at most 14 electrons\n* Each {{serif|g}} subshell holds at most 18 electrons\n\nTherefore, the K shell, which contains only an {{serif|s}} subshell, can hold up to 2 electrons; the L shell, which contains an {{serif|s}} and a {{serif|p}}, can hold up to 2 + 6 = 8 electrons, and so forth; in general, the [[square number#Properties|''n''th shell can hold up to 2''n''<sup>2</sup>]] electrons.<ref name=\"madsci\"/>\n\nAlthough that formula gives the maximum in principle, in fact that maximum is only ''achieved'' (by known elements) for the first four shells (K, L, M, N). No known element has more than 32 electrons in any one shell.<ref>[http://www.chem4kids.com/files/atom_orbital.html Orbitals]. Chem4Kids. Retrieved on 1 December 2011.</ref><ref>[http://www.chemistry.patent-invent.com/chemistry/electron_configuration.html Electron & Shell Configuration]. Chemistry.patent-invent.com. Retrieved on 1 December 2011.</ref> This is because the subshells are filled according to the [[Aufbau principle]]. The first elements to have more than 32 electrons in one shell would belong to the [[g-block]] of [[Period 8 element|period 8]] of the [[periodic table]]. These elements would have some electrons in their {{serif|5g}} subshell and thus have more than 32 electrons in the O shell (fifth principal shell).\n\n==Valence shells==\n{{main|Valence electron}}\n\nThe '''valence shell''' is the outermost shell of an [[atom]]. It is usually (and misleadingly) said that the electrons in this shell make up its [[valence electrons]], that is, the electrons that determine how the atom behaves in chemical reactions. Just as atoms with complete valence shells ([[noble gases]]) are the most chemically non-reactive, those with only one electron in their valence shells ([[alkali metal]]s) or just missing one electron from having a complete shell ([[halogen]]s) are the most reactive.<ref>[http://www.visionlearning.com/library/module_viewer.php?mid=54 Chemical Reactions]. Vision Learning (26 July 2011). Retrieved on 1 December 2011.</ref>\n\nHowever, this is a simplification of the truth. The electrons that determine how an atom reacts chemically are those that travel farthest from the nucleus, that is, those with the highest [[energy]]. For the [[transition element]]s, the partially filled (''n''\u202f\u2212\u202f1){{serif|d}} energy level is very close in energy to the ''n''{{serif|s}} level<ref>[http://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/properties/3d4sproblem.html THE ORDER OF FILLING 3d AND 4s ORBITALS]. chemguide.co.uk</ref> and hence the {{serif|d}} electrons in transition metals behave as valence electrons although they are not in the so-called valence shell.\n\n==List of elements with electrons per shell==\nThe list below gives the elements arranged by increasing atomic number and shows the number of electrons per shell. At a glance, one can see that subsets of the list show obvious patterns. In particular, the seven elements (in {{legend inline|#c0ffff|electric blue}}) before a [[noble gas]] (group 18, in {{legend inline|#ff9|yellow}}) higher than helium have the number of electrons in the [[valence electron|valence shell]] in [[arithmetic progression]]. (However, this pattern may break down in the [[period 7 element|seventh period]] due to [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]].)\n\nSorting the table by chemical [[Periodic table group|group]] shows additional patterns, especially with respect to the last two outermost shells. (Elements 57 to 71 belong to the [[lanthanide]]s, while 89 to 103 are the [[actinide]]s.)\n\nThe list below is primarily consistent with the [[Aufbau principle]]. However, there are a number of exceptions to the rule; for example [[palladium]] (atomic number 46) has no electrons in the fifth shell, unlike other atoms with ''lower'' atomic number. Some entries in the table are uncertain, when experimental data is unavailable. (For example, some atoms have such short [[half-life]] that it is impossible to measure their electron configurations).\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n![[Atomic number|''Z'']] !!
