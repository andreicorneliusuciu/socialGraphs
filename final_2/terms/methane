Its electronic structure is described by four bonding molecular orbitals (MOs) resulting from the overlap of the valence orbitals on [[Carbon|C]] and [[Hydrogen|H]]. The lowest energy MO is the result of the overlap of the 2s orbital on carbon with the in-phase combination of the 1s orbitals on the four hydrogen atoms. Above this energy level is a triply degenerate set of MOs that involve overlap of the 2p orbitals on carbon with various linear combinations of the 1s orbitals on hydrogen.

Methane is also a side product of the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide in the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]]. This technology is practiced on a large scale to produce longer chain molecules than methane.\n\nNatural gas is so abundant that the intentional production of methane is relatively rare. The only large scale facility of this kind is the [[Great Plains Synfuels]] plant, started in 1984 in Beulah, North Dakota as a way to develop abundant local resources of low grade [[lignite]], a resource which is otherwise very hard to transport for its weight, [[Coal assay#Ash|ash]] content, low calorific value and propensity to [[spontaneous combustion]] during storage and transport.\n\n===Laboratory synthesis===\nMethane can also be produced by the [[destructive distillation]] of [[acetic acid]] in the presence of [[soda lime]] or similar.

It is associated with other [[hydrocarbon]] fuels, and sometimes accompanied by [[helium]] and [[nitrogen]]. Methane is produced at shallow levels (low pressure) by [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[Decomposition|decay]] of [[organic matter]] and reworked methane from deep under the Earth's surface. In general, the [[sediment]]s that generate natural gas are buried deeper and at higher temperatures than those that contain [[Petroleum|oil]].\n\nMethane is generally transported in bulk by [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] in its natural gas form, or LNG carriers in its liquefied form; few countries transport it by truck.\n\n===Alternative sources===\n[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 1898 Testing Sheep for Methane Production.jpg|thumb|Testing Australian sheep for exhaled methane production (2001), [[CSIRO]]]]\nApart from gas fields, an alternative method of obtaining methane is via [[biogas]] generated by the [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of organic matter including [[manure]], wastewater sludge, [[municipal solid waste]] (including landfills), or any other biodegradable feedstock, under anaerobic conditions.
