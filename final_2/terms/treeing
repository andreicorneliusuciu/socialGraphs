Particularly used with [[coonhound|coonhunting]], treeing dogs are selected for the instinct to not cease barking at an animal after it has escaped into a tree. The linguistic idiom \"''[[Barking up the wrong tree]]''\" comes from this practice.\n\nThis method of hunting is also  used for [[cougar]] and [[American black bear|black bear]].  The dogs are trained to bay, not directly attack the quarry; however, it is not unheard of for the quarry to kill some of the dogs or for the dogs to kill the quarry.  Usually the quarry will climb a tree to escape the dogs after a period of chase and harassment.  [[Blackmouth Cur]] use this method. Traditionally the dogs were followed on foot by hunters listening to their barks, although some hunters now use [[radio direction finding]] equipment to follow the pack.  \n\nTreeing is also sometimes performed without the intention of killing the quarry for scientific purposes (such as radio-tagging) or recreational purposes.  It is especially useful for cougars, which are notoriously stealthy and difficult to capture without the aid of dogs.\n\n[[Category:Working dogs]]\n[[Category:Hounds|*]]\n[[Category:Hunting methods]]\n\n{{Dog-stub}}\n{{hunting-stub}}"}]}}}}
