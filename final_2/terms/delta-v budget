It is calculated as the sum of the delta-v required for the [[Spacecraft propulsion|propulsive]] [[orbital maneuver|maneuver]]s during the mission, and as input to the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]], determines how much propellant is required for a vehicle of given mass and propulsion system.\n\nDelta-''v'' is a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar quantity]] dependent only on the desired trajectory and not on the mass of the space vehicle. For example, although more thrust, fuel, etc. is needed to transfer a larger communication satellite from [[low Earth orbit]] to [[geosynchronous orbit]], the delta-''v'' required is the same. Also delta-''v'' is additive, as contrasted to rocket burn time, the latter having greater effect later in the mission when more fuel has been used up.\n\nTables of the delta-''v'' required to move between different space venues are useful in the conceptual planning of space missions. In the absence of an atmosphere, the delta-''v'' is typically the same for changes in orbit in either direction; in particular, gaining and losing speed cost an equal effort. An atmosphere can be used to slow a spacecraft by [[aerobraking]].\n\nA typical delta-''v'' budget might enumerate various classes of maneuvers, delta-''v'' per maneuver, and number of each maneuver required over the life of the mission, and simply sum the total delta-''v'', much like a typical financial budget. Because the delta-v needed to achieve the mission usually varies with the relative position of the gravitating bodies, [[launch window]]s are often calculated from [[porkchop plot]]s that show delta-''v'' plotted against the launch time.\n\n==General principles==\nThe [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]] shows that the delta-v of a rocket (stage), is proportional to the logarithm of the fuelled-to-empty [[mass ratio]] of the vehicle, and to the [[specific impulse]] of the rocket engine. A key goal in designing space-mission trajectories is to minimize the required delta-v to reduce the size and expense of the rocket that would be needed to successfully deliver any particular payload to its destination.\n\nThe simplest delta-v budget can be calculated with [[Hohmann transfer]], which moves from one circular orbit to another coplanar circular orbit via an elliptical transfer orbit. In some cases a [[bi-elliptic transfer]] can give a lower delta-v.\n\nA more complex transfer occurs when the orbits are not coplanar. In that case there is an additional delta-v necessary to change the plane of the orbit. The velocity of the vehicle needs substantial burns at the intersection of the two orbital planes and the delta-v is usually extremely high. However, these plane changes can be almost free in some cases if the gravity and mass of a planetary body is used to perform the deflection. In other cases, boosting up to a relatively high altitude [[apoapsis]] gives low speed before performing the plane change and this can give lower total delta-v.\n\nThe [[slingshot effect]] can be used in some cases to give a boost of speed/energy; if a vehicle goes past a planetary or lunar body, it is possible to pick up (or lose) much of that body's orbital speed relative to the sun or a planet.\n\nAnother effect is the [[Oberth effect]]\u2014this can be used to greatly decrease the delta-v needed, because using propellant at low potential energy/high speed multiplies the effect of a burn. Thus for example the delta-v for a Hohmann transfer from Earth's orbital radius to Mars's orbital radius (to overcome the sun's gravity) is many kilometres per second, but the incremental burn from LEO over and above the burn to overcome Earth's gravity is far less if the burn is done close to Earth than if the burn to reach a Mars transfer orbit is performed at Earth's orbit, but far away from Earth.\n\nA less used effect is [[low energy transfer]]s. These are highly nonlinear effects that work by orbital resonances and by choosing trajectories close to [[Lagrange point]]s. They can be very slow, but use very little delta-v.\n\nBecause delta-v depends on the position and motion of celestial bodies, particularly when using the slingshot effect and Oberth effect, the delta-v budget changes with launch time. These can be plotted on a [[porkchop plot]].\n\nCourse corrections usually also require some propellant budget. Propulsion systems never provide precisely the right propulsion in precisely the right direction at all times and navigation also introduces some uncertainty. Some propellant needs to be reserved to correct variations from the optimum trajectory.\n\n== Budget ==\n\n=== Launch/landing ===\n\nThe delta-v requirements for [[sub-orbital spaceflight]] are much lower than for orbital spaceflight. For the [[Ansari X Prize]] altitude of 100&nbsp;km, [[Space Ship One]] required a delta-v of roughly 1.4&nbsp;km/s. To reach low Earth orbit of the space station of 300&nbsp;km, the delta-v is over six times higher about 9.4&nbsp;km/s. Because of the exponential nature of the [[rocket equation]] the orbital rocket needs to be considerably bigger.\n\n*Launch to [[Low Earth orbit|LEO]]\u2014this not only requires an increase of velocity from 0 to 7.8&nbsp;km/s, but also typically 1.5\u20132&nbsp;km/s for [[atmospheric drag]] and [[gravity drag]]\n*[[Re-entry]] from LEO\u2014the delta-v required is the orbital maneuvering burn to lower perigee into the atmosphere, atmospheric drag takes care of the rest.\n\n=== Stationkeeping ===\n\n{| class=wikitable\n!

The heat shield increases the mass, possibly by 15%. Where a heat shield is not used the higher from LEO Delta-v figure applies, the extra propellant is likely to be heavier than a heat shield.

This results in the journey requiring a higher delta-''v'' and frequently a large increase in time compared to a high thrust chemical rocket. Nonetheless, the high [[specific impulse]] of electrical thrusters may significantly reduce the cost of the flight. For missions in the Earth\u2013Moon system, an increase in journey time from days to months could be unacceptable for human space flight, but differences in flight time for interplanetary flights are less significant and could be favorable.\n\nThe table below presents delta-''v'''s in km/s, normally accurate to 2 significant figures and will be the same in both directions, unless aerobraking is used as described in the high thrust section above.<ref name=FISO/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The orbital phasing can be problematic; once rendezvous has been achieved, low delta-''v'' return windows can be fairly far apart (more than a year, often many years), depending on the body.\n\nHowever, the delta-''v'' to reach near-Earth objects is usually over 3.8&nbsp;km/s,<ref name=rendez/> which is still less than the delta-''v'' to reach the Moon's surface.
