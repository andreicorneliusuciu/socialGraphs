A related amendment was incorporated into the [[IEEE 802.11-2007#802.11-2007|IEEE 802.11-2007]] standard.\n\n[[802.11]] is a set of [[IEEE]] standards that govern wireless networking transmission methods. They are commonly used today in their [[802.11a]], 802.11b, [[802.11g]], [[802.11n]] and [[802.11ac]] versions to provide wireless connectivity in the home, office and some commercial establishments.\n\n== Description ==\n802.11b has a maximum raw data rate of 11 Mbit/s and uses the same [[Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance|CSMA/CA]] media access method defined in the original standard. Due to the CSMA/CA protocol overhead, in practice the maximum 802.11b throughput that an application can achieve is about 5.9 Mbit/s using [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and 7.1 Mbit/s using [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]].\n\n802.11b products appeared on the market in mid-1999, since 802.11b is a direct extension of the [[Direct-sequence spread spectrum|DSSS]] (Direct-sequence spread spectrum) modulation technique defined in the original standard. The Apple [[iBook]] was the first mainstream computer sold with optional 802.11b networking. Technically, the 802.11b standard uses [[Complementary code keying]] (CCK) as its modulation technique. The dramatic increase in throughput of 802.11b (compared to the original standard) along with simultaneous substantial price reductions led to the rapid acceptance of 802.11b as the definitive wireless LAN technology.\n\n802.11b devices suffer interference from other products operating in the 2.4 GHz band. Devices operating in the 2.4 GHz range include: [[microwave oven]]s, [[Bluetooth]] devices, baby monitors and cordless telephones. Interference issues and user density problems within the 2.4 GHz band have become a major concern and frustration for users.\n\n== Range ==\n802.11b is used in a [[point-to-multipoint]] configuration, wherein an [[Wireless access point|access point]] communicates via an [[omnidirectional antenna]] with mobile clients within the range of the access point.  Typical range depends on the radio frequency environment, output power and sensitivity of the receiver.  Allowable bandwidth is shared across clients in discrete channels.  A directional antenna focuses output power into a smaller field which increases point-to-point range.  Designers of such installations who wish to remain within the law must however be careful about legal limitations on [[effective radiated power]].<ref name=80211ERPLimitations>{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2009-title47-vol1/pdf/CFR-2009-title47-vol1-part15.pdf |accessdate=2013-06-10 |date=2006-10-01 |title=Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47-Telecommunications, Chapter I-Federal Communications Commission, Part 15-Radio Frequency Devices, Section 15.247}}</ref>\n\nSome 802.11b cards operate at 11 Mbit/s, but scale back to 5.5, then to 2, then to 1 Mbit/s (also known as Adaptive Rate Selection) in order to decrease the rate of re-broadcasts that result from errors.\n\n==Channels and Frequencies==\n[[Image:2.4 GHz Wi-Fi channels (802.11b,g WLAN).svg|thumb|upright=3.25|802.11b/g channels in 2.4 GHz band]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]]b channel to frequency map <ref>http://download.wcvirtual.com/reference/802%20Channel%20Freq%20Mappings.pdf</ref>\n|-\n!
