However, it was not until the 1960s that researchers started to investigate [[packet switching]] &mdash; a technology that would allow chunks of data to be sent to different computers without first passing through a centralized mainframe. A four-node network emerged on 5 December 1969; this network would become [[ARPANET]], which by 1981 would consist of 213 nodes.<ref>{{cite book | last = Hafner | first = Katie | title = Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet | publisher = Simon & Schuster | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-684-83267-4 }}</ref>\n\nARPANET development centered around the [[Request for Comment]] process and on 7 April 1969, RFC 1 was published. This process is important because ARPANET eventually merged with other networks to form the [[Internet]] and many of the protocols the Internet relies upon today were specified through the Request for Comment process. In September 1981, RFC 791 introduced the [[Internet Protocol]] v4 (IPv4) and RFC 793 introduced the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) &mdash; thus creating the TCP/IP protocol that much of the [[Internet]] relies upon today.\n\nHowever, not all important developments were made through the Request for Comment process. Two popular link protocols for [[local area network]]s (LANs) also appeared in the 1970s. A patent for the [[token ring]] protocol was filed by [[Olof Soderblom]] on 29 October 1974 and a paper on the [[Ethernet]] protocol was published by [[Robert Metcalfe]] and [[David Boggs]] in the July 1976 issue of ''[[Communications of the ACM]]''.<ref>[http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=4293948.PN.&OS=PN/4293948&RS=PN/4293948 Data transmission system], Olof Solderblom, PN 4,293,948, October 1974.</ref><ref>[http://www.acm.org/classics/apr96/ Ethernet: Distributed Packet Switching for Local Computer Networks], Robert M.

Some of these concepts are discussed below.\n\n=== Basic elements ===\nTelecommunications is primarily divided up between wired and wireless subtypes. Overall though, a basic [[communication system|telecommunication system]] consists of three main parts that are always present in some form or another:\n* A [[transmitter]] that takes information and converts it to a [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]].\n* A [[transmission medium]], also called the \"physical channel\" that carries the signal. An example of this is the [[Free-space optical communication|\"free space channel\"]].\n* A [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] that takes the signal from the channel and converts it back into usable information for the recipient.\n\nFor example, in a [[radio station|radio broadcasting station]] the station's large [[power amplifier]] is the transmitter; and the broadcasting [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] is the interface between the power amplifier and the \"free space channel\". The free space channel is the transmission medium; and the receiver's antenna is the interface between the free space channel and the receiver. Next, the [[radio receiver]] is the destination of the radio signal, and this is where it is converted from electricity to sound for people to listen to.\n\nSometimes, telecommunication systems are [[duplex (telecommunications)|\"duplex\"]] (two-way systems) with a single box of [[electronics]] working as both the transmitter and a receiver, or a ''transceiver''. For example, a [[cellular telephone]] is a transceiver.<ref name=\"stallings-intro\">{{cite book | last = Haykin | first = Simon | edition= 4th | title = Communication Systems | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | year = 2001 | pages = 1\u20133 | isbn = 0-471-17869-1 }}</ref> The transmission electronics and the receiver electronics within a transceiver are actually quite independent of each other. This can be readily explained by the fact that radio transmitters contain power amplifiers that operate with electrical powers measured in [[watt]]s or [[kilowatt]]s, but radio receivers deal with radio powers that are measured in the [[microwatt]]s or [[nanowatt]]s. Hence, transceivers have to be carefully designed and built to isolate their high-power circuitry and their low-power circuitry from each other, as to not cause interference.\n\nTelecommunication over fixed lines is called [[point-to-point communication (telecommunications)|point-to-point communication]] because it is between one transmitter and one receiver. Telecommunication through radio broadcasts is called [[broadcasting|broadcast communication]] because it is between one powerful transmitter and numerous low-power but sensitive radio receivers.<ref name=\"stallings-intro\" />\n\nTelecommunications in which multiple transmitters and multiple receivers have been designed to cooperate and to share the same physical channel are called [[multiplexing|multiplex systems]]. The sharing of physical channels using multiplexing often gives very large reductions in costs. Multiplexed systems are laid out in telecommunication networks, and the multiplexed signals are switched at nodes through to the correct destination terminal receiver.\n\n=== Analog versus digital communications ===\nCommunications signals can be sent either by [[analog signal]]s or [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]]s. There are [[analog communication]] systems and [[digital communication]] systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously with respect to the information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by [[noise (signal processing)|undesirable physical noise]]. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely [[random process|random way]]. This form of noise is called [[additive noise]], with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.\n\nOn the other hand, unless the additive noise disturbance exceeds a certain threshold, the information contained in digital signals will remain intact. Their resistance to noise represents a key advantage of digital signals over analog signals.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ambardar | first = Ashok | edition= 2nd | title = Analog and Digital Signal Processing | publisher = Brooks/Cole Publishing Company | year = 1999 | pages = 1\u20132 | isbn = 0-534-95409-X }}</ref>\n\n=== Telecommunication networks ===\nA [[telecommunications network]] is a collection of transmitters, receivers, and [[communications channel]]s that send messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more [[Router (computing)|routers]] that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network consists of one or more [[telephone switch|switches]] that establish a connection between two or more users. For both types of network, [[repeater]]s may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances. This is to combat [[attenuation]] that can render the signal indistinguishable from the noise.<ref name=\"glossary\">[http://www.atis.org/tg2k/ ATIS Telecom Glossary 2000], ATIS Committee T1A1 Performance and Signal Processing (approved by the American National Standards Institute), 28 February 2001.</ref>\nAnother advantage of digital systems over analog is that their output is easier to store in memory, i.e. two voltage states (high and low) are easier to store than a continuous range of states.\n\n=== Communication channels ===\nThe term \"channel\" has two different meanings. In one meaning, a channel is the physical medium that carries a signal between the transmitter and the receiver. Examples of this include the [[atmosphere]] for sound communications, glass [[optical fiber]]s for some kinds of [[optical communications]], [[coaxial cable]]s for communications by way of the voltages and electric currents in them, and [[Free-space optical communication|free space]] for communications using [[visible light]], [[infrared|infrared waves]], [[ultraviolet light]], and [[radio wave]]s. This last channel is called the \"free space channel\". The sending of radio waves from one place to another has nothing to do with the presence or absence of an atmosphere between the two. Radio waves travel through a perfect [[vacuum]] just as easily as they travel through air, fog, clouds, or any other kind of gas.\n\nThe other meaning of the term \"channel\" in telecommunications is seen in the phrase [[channel (communications)|communications channel]], which is a subdivision of a transmission medium so that it can be used to send multiple streams of information simultaneously. For example, one radio station can broadcast radio waves into free space at frequencies in the neighborhood of 94.5&nbsp;[[MHz]] (megahertz) while another radio station can simultaneously broadcast radio waves at frequencies in the neighborhood of 96.1&nbsp;MHz. Each radio station would transmit radio waves over a frequency [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of about 180&nbsp;[[kHz]] (kilohertz), centered at frequencies such as the above, which are called the [[Carrier wave|\"carrier frequencies\"]]. Each station in this example is separated from its adjacent stations by 200&nbsp;kHz, and the difference between 200&nbsp;kHz and 180&nbsp;kHz (20&nbsp;kHz) is an engineering allowance for the imperfections in the communication system.\n\nIn the example above, the \"free space channel\" has been divided into communications channels according to [[frequency|frequencies]], and each channel is assigned a separate frequency bandwidth in which to broadcast radio waves. This system of dividing the medium into channels according to frequency is called \"[[frequency-division multiplexing]]\".  Another term for the same concept is \"[[wavelength-division multiplexing]]\", which is more commonly used in optical communications when multiple transmitters share the same physical medium.\n\nAnother way of dividing a communications medium into channels is to allocate each sender a recurring segment of time (a \"time slot\", for example, 20 [[milliseconds]] out of each second), and to allow each sender to send messages only within its own time slot. This method of dividing the medium into communication channels is called \"[[time-division multiplexing]]\" ('''TDM'''), and is used in optical fiber communication. Some radio communication systems use TDM within an allocated FDM channel. Hence, these systems use a hybrid of TDM and FDM.\n\n=== Modulation ===\nThe shaping of a signal to convey information is known as [[modulation]]. Modulation can be used to represent a digital message as an analog waveform. This is commonly called [[keying (telecommunications)|\"keying\"]] \u2013 a term derived from the older use of Morse Code in telecommunications \u2013 and several keying techniques exist (these include [[phase-shift keying]], [[frequency-shift keying]], and [[amplitude-shift keying]]). The \"[[Bluetooth]]\" system, for example, uses phase-shift keying to exchange information between various devices.<ref>Haykin, pp 344\u2013403.</ref><ref>[http://www.bluetooth.org/foundry/adopters/document/Core_v2.0_EDR/en/1/Core_v2.0_EDR.zip Bluetooth Specification Version 2.0 + EDR] (p 27), Bluetooth, 2004.</ref> In addition, there are combinations of phase-shift keying and amplitude-shift keying which is called (in the jargon of the field) \"[[quadrature amplitude modulation]]\" (QAM) that are used in high-capacity digital radio communication systems.\n\nModulation can also be used to transmit the information of low-frequency analog signals at higher frequencies. This is helpful because low-frequency analog signals cannot be effectively transmitted over free space. Hence the information from a low-frequency analog signal must be impressed into a higher-frequency signal (known as the \"[[carrier wave]]\") before transmission. There are several different modulation schemes available to achieve this [two of the most basic being [[amplitude modulation]] (AM) and [[frequency modulation]] (FM)]. An example of this process is a disc jockey's voice being impressed into a 96&nbsp;MHz carrier wave using frequency modulation (the voice would then be received on a radio as the channel \"96&nbsp;FM\").<ref>Haykin, pp 88\u2013126.</ref> In addition, modulation has the advantage that it may use frequency division multiplexing (FDM).\n\n== Society ==\nTelecommunication has a significant social, cultural and economic impact on modern society. In 2008, estimates placed the [[telecommunication industry]]'s revenue at $4.7 trillion or just under 3 percent of the [[gross world product]] (official exchange rate).<ref name=\"plunkettresearch01\" /> Several following sections discuss the impact of telecommunication on society.\n\n=== Economic impact ===\n\n==== Microeconomics ====\nOn the microeconomic scale, companies have used telecommunications to help build global business empires. This is self-evident in the case of online retailer [[Amazon.com]] but, according to academic Edward Lenert, even the conventional retailer [[Walmart]] has benefited from better telecommunication infrastructure compared to its competitors.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Lenert | first = Edward |date=December 1998 | title = A Communication Theory Perspective on Telecommunications Policy | journal = Journal of Communication| volume = 48 | issue = 4 | pages = 3\u201323 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1998.tb02767.x}}</ref> In cities throughout the world, home owners use their telephones to order and arrange a variety of home services ranging from pizza deliveries to electricians. Even relatively poor communities have been noted to use telecommunication to their advantage. In [[Bangladesh]]'s Narshingdi district, isolated villagers use cellular phones to speak directly to wholesalers and arrange a better price for their goods. In [[Ivory Coast|C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]], coffee growers share mobile phones to follow hourly variations in coffee prices and sell at the best price.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mireille Samaan | title = The Effect of Income Inequality on Mobile Phone Penetration | version = Boston University Honors thesis | date = April 2003 | url = http://dissertations.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=ashonors | format = PDF | accessdate =8 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070214102055/http://dissertations.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=ashonors |archivedate = 14 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n==== Macroeconomics ====\nOn the macroeconomic scale, Lars-Hendrik R\u00f6ller and [[Leonard Waverman]] suggested a causal link between good telecommunication infrastructure and economic growth.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1257/aer.91.4.909 | last = R\u00f6ller | first = Lars-Hendrik |author2=Leonard Waverman  | title = Telecommunications Infrastructure and Economic Development: A Simultaneous Approach | journal = American Economic Review | issn = 0002-8282 | year = 2001 | volume = 91 | issue = 4 | pages = 909\u2013923}}</ref><ref>Qiang, Rossotto, 2009, Economic Impact of Broadband, http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTIC4D/Resources/IC4D_Broadband_35_50.pdf</ref> Few dispute the existence of a correlation although some argue it is wrong to view the relationship as causal.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Riaz | first = Ali | title = The role of telecommunications in economic growth: proposal for an alternative framework of analysis | journal = Media, Culture & Society | year = 1997 | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 557\u2013583 | doi = 10.1177/016344397019004004}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the economic benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure, there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world\u2014this is known as the [[digital divide]]. A 2003 survey by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Digital Access Index (DAI)|url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/dai/|publisher=itu.int|accessdate=6 March 2008}}</ref> Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and [[Iceland]] received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.<ref>[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/publications/wtdr_03/index.html World Telecommunication Development Report 2003], International Telecommunication Union, 2003.</ref>\n\n=== Social impact ===\nTelecommunication has played a significant role in social relationships. Nevertheless, devices like the telephone system were originally advertised with an emphasis on the practical dimensions of the device (such as the ability to conduct business or order home services) as opposed to the social dimensions. It was not until the late 1920s and 1930s that the social dimensions of the device became a prominent theme in telephone advertisements. New promotions started appealing to consumers' emotions, stressing the importance of social conversations and staying connected to family and friends.<ref name=\"fischer\">Fischer, Claude S. \"'Touch Someone': The Telephone Industry Discovers Sociability.\" Technology and Culture 29.1 (January 1988): 32\u201361. JSTOR. Web. 4 October 2009.</ref>\n\nSince then the role that telecommunications has played in social relations has become increasingly important. In recent years, the popularity of [[social networking site]]s has increased dramatically. These sites allow users to communicate with each other as well as post photographs, events and profiles for others to see. The profiles can list a person's age, interests, sexual preference and relationship status. In this way, these sites can play important role in everything from organising social engagements to [[courtship]].<ref>{{cite news|title=How do you know your love is real?

In 2000, market research group [[Ipsos MORI]] reported that 81% of 15- to 24-year-old SMS users in the United Kingdom had used the service to coordinate social arrangements and 42% to flirt.<ref>[http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/1575/I-Just-Text-To-Say-I-Love-You.aspx I Just Text To Say I Love You], Ipsos MORI, September 2005.</ref>\n\n=== Other impacts ===\nIn cultural terms, telecommunication has increased the public's ability to access music and film. With television, people can watch films they have not seen before in their own home without having to travel to the video store or cinema. With radio and the Internet, people can listen to music they have not heard before without having to travel to the music store.\n\nTelecommunication has also transformed the way people receive their news. A survey led in 2006 by the non-profit Pew Internet and American Life Project found that when just over 3,000 people living in the United States were asked where they got their news \"yesterday\", more people said television or radio than newspapers. The results are summarised in the following table (the percentages add up to more than 100% because people were able to specify more than one source).<ref>{{cite web|title=Online News: For many home broadband users, the internet is a primary news source|publisher=Pew Internet Project|url=http://www.ccgrouppr.com/PIP_News.and.Broadband.pdf|date=22 March 2006}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

As Thompson argues the advent of telecommunication technologies, such as the telegraph and telephone, resulted in the \"uncoupling of space and time\" in the sense that concepts of space and time were altered in the communication process. <ref name=autogenerated1 /> This prepared the way for another transformation, which Nowotny describes as: the \"discovery of despatialized simultaneity\"<ref name=autogenerated2>Nowotny, Helga (1994) Time, the Modern and Post-modern Experience, trans.

The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller [[pulse dialing|dials]] the number. Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small [[microphone]] in the caller's [[handset]]. This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small [[loudspeaker|speaker]] in that person's handset.\n\nThe landline telephones in most residential homes are analog\u2014that is, the speaker's voice directly determines the signal's voltage.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Although short-distance calls may be handled from end-to-end as analog signals, increasingly telephone service providers are transparently converting the signals to digital signals for transmission. The advantage of this is that digitized voice data can travel side-by-side with data from the Internet and can be perfectly reproduced in long distance communication (as opposed to analog signals that are inevitably impacted by noise).\n\nMobile phones have had a significant impact on telephone networks. Mobile phone subscriptions now outnumber fixed-line subscriptions in many markets. Sales of mobile phones in 2005 totalled 816.6 million with that figure being almost equally shared amongst the markets of Asia/Pacific (204 m), Western Europe (164 m), CEMEA (Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa) (153.5 m), North America (148 m) and Latin America (102 m).<ref>[http://www.gartner.com/press_releases/asset_145891_11.html Gartner Says Top Six Vendors Drive Worldwide Mobile Phone Sales to 21% Growth in 2005], Gartner Group, 28 February 2006.</ref> In terms of new subscriptions over the five years from 1999, Africa has outpaced other markets with 58.2% growth.<ref>[http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/may06/3426 Africa Calling], Victor and Irene Mbarika, [[IEEE Spectrum]], May 2006.</ref> Increasingly these phones are being serviced by systems where the voice content is transmitted digitally such as [[GSM]] or [[W-CDMA]] with many markets choosing to depreciate analog systems such as [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]].<ref>[http://www.amta.org.au/default.asp?Page=142 Ten Years of GSM in Australia], Australia Telecommunications Association, 2003.</ref>\n\nThere have also been dramatic changes in telephone communication behind the scenes. Starting with the operation of [[TAT-8]] in 1988, the 1990s saw the widespread adoption of systems based on optical fibers. The benefit of communicating with optic fibers is that they offer a drastic increase in data capacity. TAT-8 itself was able to carry 10 times as many telephone calls as the last copper cable laid at that time and today's optic fibre cables are able to carry 25 times as many telephone calls as TAT-8.<ref>[http://www.att.com/history/milestones.html Milestones in AT&T History], AT&T Knowledge Ventures, 2006.</ref> This increase in data capacity is due to several factors: First, optic fibres are physically much smaller than competing technologies. Second, they do not suffer from [[crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]] which means several hundred of them can be easily bundled together in a single cable.<ref>[http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/S.Bhatti/D51-notes/node21.html Optical fibre waveguide], Saleem Bhatti, 1995.</ref> Lastly, improvements in multiplexing have led to an exponential growth in the data capacity of a single fibre.<ref>[http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/mels/cm1500/dwdm/dwdm_ovr.pdf Fundamentals of DWDM Technology], CISCO Systems, 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=31358 Report: DWDM No Match for Sonet], Mary Jander, Light Reading, 2006.</ref>\n\nAssisting communication across many modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM). The ATM protocol allows for the side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a [[traffic contract]] with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet the conditions of the traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely.<ref>{{cite book | last = Stallings | first = William | edition= 7th edition (intl) | title = Data and Computer Communications | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2004 | pages = 337\u2013366 | isbn = 0-13-183311-1 }}</ref> There are competitors to ATM, such as [[Multiprotocol Label Switching]] (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.<ref>[http://www.networkworld.com/columnists/2002/0812edit.html MPLS is the future, but ATM hangs on], John Dix, Network World, 2002</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lazar|first=Irwin|title=The WAN Road Ahead: Ethernet or Bust?|url=http://www.telarus.com/industry/the-wan-road-ahead:-ethernet-or-bust.html|accessdate=22 February 2011|newspaper=Telecom Industry Updates|date=22 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Radio and television ===\n{{Main article|Radio|Television|Broadcasting}}\n[[File:Digital broadcast standards.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Digital television]] standards and their adoption worldwide]]\n\nIn a broadcast system, the central high-powered [[radio masts and towers|broadcast tower]] transmits a high-frequency [[electromagnetic wave]] to numerous low-powered receivers. The high-frequency wave sent by the tower is modulated with a signal containing visual or audio information. The receiver is then [[antenna tuner|tuned]] so as to pick up the high-frequency wave and a [[demodulator]] is used to retrieve the signal containing the visual or audio information. The broadcast signal can be either analog (signal is varied continuously with respect to the information) or digital (information is encoded as a set of discrete values).<ref name=\"stallings-intro\" /><ref>[http://www.howstuffworks.com/radio.htm How Radio Works], HowStuffWorks.com, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe [[broadcast media industry]] is at a critical turning point in its development, with many countries moving from analog to digital broadcasts. This move is made possible by the production of cheaper, faster and more capable [[integrated circuit]]s. The chief advantage of digital broadcasts is that they prevent a number of complaints common to traditional analog broadcasts. For television, this includes the elimination of problems such as [[noise (video)|snowy pictures]], [[television interference (ghosting)|ghosting]] and other distortion. These occur because of the nature of analog transmission, which means that perturbations due to noise will be evident in the final output. Digital transmission overcomes this problem because digital signals are reduced to discrete values upon reception and hence small perturbations do not affect the final output. In a simplified example, if a binary message 1011 was transmitted with signal amplitudes [1.0 0.0 1.0 1.0] and received with signal amplitudes [0.9 0.2 1.1 0.9] it would still decode to the binary message 1011 \u2014 a perfect reproduction of what was sent. From this example, a problem with digital transmissions can also be seen in that if the noise is great enough it can significantly alter the decoded message. Using [[forward error correction]] a receiver can correct a handful of bit errors in the resulting message but too much noise will lead to incomprehensible output and hence a breakdown of the transmission.<ref>[http://www.digitaltv.com.au/ Digital Television in Australia], Digital Television News Australia, 2001.</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Stallings | first = William | edition= 7th edition (intl) | title = Data and Computer Communications | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-13-183311-1 }}</ref>\n\nIn digital television broadcasting, there are three competing standards that are likely to be adopted worldwide. These are the [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]], [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] and [[ISDB]] standards; the adoption of these standards thus far is presented in the captioned map. All three standards use [[MPEG-2]] for video compression. ATSC uses [[Dolby Digital|Dolby Digital AC-3]] for audio compression, ISDB uses [[Advanced Audio Coding]] (MPEG-2 Part 7) and DVB has no standard for audio compression but typically uses [[MPEG-1|MPEG-1 Part 3 Layer 2]].<ref>[http://www.dynamix.ca/doc/HDVhandbook1.pdf HDV Technology Handbook], [[Sony]], 2004.</ref><ref>[http://www.dvb.org/technology/standards_specifications/audio/ Audio], Digital Video Broadcasting Project, 2003.</ref> The choice of modulation also varies between the schemes.<!--Both DVB and ISDB use [[orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]] (OFDM) for terrestrial broadcasts (as opposed to satellite or cable broadcasts) whereas ATSC uses [[8VSB|vestigial sideband modulation]] (VSB). OFDM should offer better resistance to multipath interference and the [[Doppler effect]] (which would impact reception using moving receivers).<ref>[http://www.mrcbroadcast.com/tech_services/COFDM%20vs%20VSB.html COFDM versus VSB in ENG/HD-ENG], Microwave Radio Communications, 2006.</ref> However controversial tests conducted by the United States' [[National Association of Broadcasters]] have shown that there is little difference between the two for stationary receivers.<ref>[http://www.hdtvmagazine.com/archives/mstvtestsum.html 8VSB/COFDM Comparison Report], VSB/COFDM Project, December 2000 (preface by Dale Cripps of HDTV Magazine).</ref>--> In digital audio broadcasting, standards are much more unified with practically all countries choosing to adopt the [[Digital Audio Broadcasting]] standard (also known as the [[Eureka 147]] standard). The exception is the United States which has chosen to adopt [[HD Radio]]. HD Radio, unlike Eureka 147, is based upon a transmission method known as [[in-band on-channel]] transmission that allows digital information to \"piggyback\" on normal AM or FM analog transmissions.<ref>[http://www.worlddab.org/cstatus.aspx Status of DAB (USA)], World DAB Forum, March 2005.</ref> <!-- This avoids the bandwidth allocation issues of Eureka 147 and therefore being strongly advocated National Association of Broadcasters who felt there was a lack of new spectrum to allocate for the Eureka 147 standard. --><!-- In the United States the [[Federal Communications Commission]] has chosen to leave licensing of the standard in the hands of a commercial corporation called [[iBiquity]].<ref>[http://www.ibiquity.com/licensing/index.htm Licensing], iBiquity Digital, 2005.</ref> An open in-band on-channel standard exists in the form of [[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM) however adoption of this standard is mostly limited to a handful of [[shortwave|shortwave broadcasts]].

HD Radio uses a codec called [[High-Definition Coding]].-->\n\nHowever, despite the pending switch to digital, analog television remains being transmitted in most countries. An exception is the United States that ended analog television transmission (by all but the very low-power TV stations) on 12 June 2009<ref>{{cite news | author=Brian Stelter | title=Changeover to Digital TV Off to a Smooth Start | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/14/business/media/14digital.html?_r=2&hp |work=New York Times | date=13 June 2009 }}</ref> after twice delaying the switchover deadline,Kenya also ended analog television transmission in December 2014 after multiple delays. For analog television, there are three standards in use for broadcasting color TV (see a map on adoption [[:Image:NTSC-PAL-SECAM.png|here]]). These are known as [[PAL]] (German designed), [[NTSC]] (North American designed), and [[SECAM]] (French designed). (It is important to understand that these are the ways of sending color TV, and they do not have anything to do with the standards for black & white TV, which also vary from country to country.)<!--The basics of PAL and NTSC are very similar; a [[quadrature amplitude modulation|quadrature amplitude modulated]] [[subcarrier]] carrying the chrominance information is added to the luminance video signal to form a [[composite video signal]] (CVBS). On the other hand, the SECAM system uses a frequency modulation scheme on both of its ''two'' color subcarriers. The PAL system differs from NTSC in that the phase of the video signal's color components is inverted with each line, which helps in canceling-out the unavoidable phase errors in TV transmission and reception.--> For analog radio, the switch to digital radio is made more difficult by the fact that analog receivers are sold at a small fraction of the price of digital receivers.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J060 GE 72664 Portable AM/FM Radio], Amazon.com, June 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.worlddab.org/dabprod.aspx DAB Products], World DAB Forum, 2006.</ref> The choice of modulation for analog radio is typically between amplitude ('''AM''') or frequency modulation ('''FM'''). To achieve [[stereophonic sound|stereo playback]], an amplitude modulated subcarrier is used for [[stereo FM]]<!-- and quadrature amplitude modulation is used for stereo AM or [[C-QUAM]] -->.\n\n=== Internet ===\n[[File:OSI Model v1.svg|upright=1.2|thumb|The [[OSI reference model]]]]\nThe [[Internet]] is a worldwide network of computers and computer networks that communicate with each other using the Internet Protocol.<ref>Robert E. Kahn and Vinton G. Cerf, [http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/what_is_internet.html What Is The Internet (And What Makes It Work)], December 1999. (specifically see footnote xv)</ref> Any computer on the Internet has a unique [[IP address]] that can be used by other computers to route information to it. Hence, any computer on the Internet can send a message to any other computer using its IP address. These messages carry with them the originating computer's IP address allowing for two-way communication. The Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers.<ref>[http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet-infrastructure.htm How Internet Infrastructure Works], HowStuffWorks.com, 2007.</ref>\n\nIt is estimated that the 51% of the information flowing through two-way telecommunications networks in the year 2000 were flowing through the Internet (most of the rest (42%) through the [[landline telephone]]). By the year 2007 the Internet clearly dominated and captured 97% of all the information in telecommunication networks (most of the rest (2%) through [[mobile phones]]).<ref name=\"HilbertLopez2011\"/> {{As of|2008}}, an estimated 21.9% of the world population has access to the Internet with the highest access rates (measured as a percentage of the population) in North America (73.6%), Oceania/Australia (59.5%) and Europe (48.1%).<ref>[http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm World Internet Users and Population Stats], internetworldstats.com, 19 March 2007.</ref> In terms of [[Broadband Internet access|broadband access]], Iceland (26.7%), South Korea (25.4%) and the Netherlands (25.3%) led the world.<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/document/39/0,2340,en_2649_34225_36459431_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD Broadband Statistics], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], December 2005.</ref>\n\nThe Internet works in part because of [[communications protocol|protocols]] that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of why this is important is because it allows an [[Internet browser]] to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an Ethernet or [[Wi-Fi]] connection. Protocols are often talked about in terms of their place in the OSI reference model (pictured on the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite.<ref>[http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_HistoryoftheOSIReferenceModel.htm History of the OSI Reference Model], The TCP/IP Guide v3.0, Charles M. Kozierok, 2005.</ref>\n\nFor the Internet, the physical medium and data link protocol can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. This is because the Internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used. This leads to the adoption of media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.\n\nAt the network layer, things become standardized with the Internet Protocol (IP) being adopted for [[logical address]]ing. For the World Wide Web, these \"IP addresses\" are derived from the human readable form using the [[Domain Name System]] (e.g. [http://72.14.207.99/ 72.14.207.99] is derived from [https://www.google.com/ www.google.com]). At the moment, the most widely used version of the Internet Protocol is version four but a move to version six is imminent.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/itsolutions/network/ipv6/introipv6.mspx Introduction to IPv6], Microsoft Corporation, February 2006.</ref> <!-- The main advantage of the new version is that it supports 3.40{{e|38}} addresses compared to 4.29{{e|9}} addresses. The new version also adds support for enhanced security through [[IPSec]] as well as support for [[quality of service|QoS identifiers]].-->\n\nAt the transport layer, most communication adopts either the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP). TCP is used when it is essential every message sent is received by the other computer whereas UDP is used when it is merely desirable. With TCP, packets are retransmitted if they are lost and placed in order before they are presented to higher layers<!-- (this ordering also allows duplicate packets to be eliminated) -->. With UDP, packets are not ordered or retransmitted if lost. Both TCP and UDP packets carry [[TCP and UDP port|port numbers]] with them to specify what application or [[process (computing)|process]] the packet should be handled by.<ref>Stallings, pp 683\u2013702.</ref> Because certain application-level protocols use [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|certain ports]], network administrators can manipulate traffic to suit particular requirements. Examples are to restrict Internet access by blocking the traffic destined for a particular port or to affect the performance of certain applications by assigning [[WAN optimization|priority]].\n\nAbove the transport layer, there are certain protocols that are sometimes used and loosely fit in the session and presentation layers, most notably the [[Secure Sockets Layer]] (SSL) and [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS) protocols. These protocols ensure that data transferred between two parties remains completely confidential.<!-- and one or the other is in use when a padlock appears in the address bar of your web browser. Security is generally based upon the principle that eavesdroppers cannot factorize very large numbers that are the composite of two primes without knowing one of the primes.--><ref>T. Dierks and C. Allen, The TLS Protocol Version 1.0, RFC 2246, 1999.</ref><!--Another protocol that loosely fits in the session and presentation layers is the [[Real-time Transport Protocol]] (RTP) most notably used to stream QuickTime.<ref>[http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/rtp/ RTP: About RTP and the Audio-Video Transport Working], Henning Schulzrinne, July 2006.</ref> --> Finally, at the application layer, are many of the protocols Internet users would be familiar with such as [[HTTP]] (web browsing), [[POP3]] (e-mail), [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] (file transfer), [[IRC]] (Internet chat), [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] (file sharing) and [[XMPP]] (instant messaging).\n\n[[VoIP|Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) allows data packets to be used for [[synchronous]] voice communications. The data packets are marked as voice type packets and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the real-time, synchronous conversation is less subject to contention with other types of data traffic which can be delayed (i.e. file transfer or email) or buffered in advance (i.e. audio and video) without detriment. That prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking place at the same time and the network is enabled for prioritization i.e. a private corporate style network, but the Internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of VoIP calls over a private network and over the public Internet.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.telecomsadvice.org.uk/infosheets/voip_voice_over_internet_protocol_and_internet_telephony.htm|title= VoIP, Voice over Internet Protocol and Internet telephone calls|last= Multimedia|first= Crucible|date= 2011-05-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Local area networks and wide area networks ===\nDespite the growth of the Internet, the characteristics of [[local area network]]s (LANs)--computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers\u2014remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-effective and efficient without them. When they are not connected with the Internet, they also have the advantages of privacy and security. However, purposefully lacking a direct connection to the Internet does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.\n\n[[Wide area network]]s (WANs) are private computer networks that may extend for thousands of kilometers. Once again, some of their advantages include privacy and security. Prime users of private LANs and WANs include armed forces and intelligence agencies that must keep their information secure and secret.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, several sets of communication protocols emerged to fill the gaps between the data-link layer and the application layer of the [[OSI reference model]]. These included [[Appletalk]], [[IPX]], and [[NetBIOS]] with the dominant protocol set during the early 1990s being IPX due to its popularity with [[MS-DOS]] users. [[TCP/IP]] existed at this point, but it was typically only used by large government and research facilities.<ref>Martin, Michael (2000). ''Understanding the Network'' ([http://www.informit.com/content/images/0735709777/samplechapter/0735709777.pdf The Networker's Guide to AppleTalk, IPX, and NetBIOS]), SAMS Publishing, ISBN 0-7357-0977-7.</ref>\n\nAs the Internet grew in popularity and its traffic was required to be routed into private networks, the TCP/IP protocols replaced existing local area network technologies. Additional technologies, such as [[DHCP]], allowed TCP/IP-based computers to self-configure in the network. Such functions also existed in the AppleTalk/ IPX/ NetBIOS protocol sets.<ref>Ralph Droms, [http://www.dhcp.org/ Resources for DHCP], November 2003.</ref>\n\nWhereas Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) are typical data-link protocols for larger networks such as WANs; Ethernet and [[IBM token ring|Token Ring]] are typical data-link protocols for LANs. These protocols differ from the former protocols in that they are simpler, e.g., they omit features such as [[quality of service]] guarantees, and offer [[carrier sense multiple access with collision detection|collision prevention]]. Both of these differences allow for more economical systems.<ref>Stallings, pp. 500\u2013526.</ref>\n\nDespite the modest popularity of IBM Token Ring in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs now use either wired or wireless Ethernet facilities. At the physical layer, most wired Ethernet implementations use [[twisted pair|copper twisted-pair cables]] (including the common [[10BASE-T]] networks). However, some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-speed ones) use optical fibers.<ref>Stallings, pp 514\u2013516.</ref> When optic fibers are used, the distinction must be made between multimode fibers and single-mode fibers. [[Multi-mode optical fiber|Multimode fibers]] can be thought of as thicker optical fibers that are cheaper to manufacture devices for, but that suffers from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation \u2013 implying poorer long-distance performance.<ref>[http://www.arcelect.com/fibercable.htm Fiber Optic Cable Tutorial], Arc Electronics.
