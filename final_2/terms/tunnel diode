In 1973 he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], jointly with [[Brian Josephson]], for discovering the [[electron tunneling]] effect used in these diodes. [[Robert Noyce]] independently came up with the idea of a tunnel diode while working for [[William Shockley]], but was discouraged from pursuing it.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Man Behind the Microchip: Robert Noyce and the Invention of Silicon Valley |last=Berlin |first=Leslie |authorlink=Leslie_Berlin |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |isbn=0-19-516343-5}}</ref>\n\nThese diodes have a heavily [[doping (semiconductor)|doped]] [[p\u2013n junction]] that is about 10&nbsp;nm (100 [[\u00c5ngstr\u00f6m|\u00c5]]) wide. The heavy doping results in a broken [[band gap]], where [[conduction band]] [[electron configuration|electron states]] on the n-side are more or less aligned with [[valence band]] [[electron hole|hole states]] on the p-side.\n\nTunnel diodes were first manufactured by [[Sony]] in 1957<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sony.co.jp/Products/SC-HP/outline/overview/history.html|script-title=ja:\u30bd\u30cb\u30fc\u534a\u5c0e\u4f53\u306e\u6b74\u53f2|language=Japanese}}</ref> followed by [[General Electric]] and other companies from about 1960, and are still made in low volume today.<ref>[http://www.eetimes.com/special/special_issues/millennium/milestones/holonyak.html \"Tunnel diodes, the transistor killers\"], ''EE Times'', retrieved 2 October 2009</ref> Tunnel diodes are usually made from [[germanium]], but can also be made from [[gallium arsenide]] and [[silicon]] materials. They are used in [[frequency mixer|frequency converter]]s and [[detector (radio)|detectors]].<ref>Fink, pp. 7\u201335</ref> They have [[negative resistance|negative differential resistance]] in part of their operating range, and therefore are also used as [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]]s, [[amplifier]]s, and in [[switching circuit]]s using [[hysteresis]].\n\n[[File:10Gig Tunnel Amp M.jpg|thumb|250px|Figure 6: 8\u201312 GHz tunnel diode amplifier, circa 1970]]\nIn 1977, the [[Intelsat]] V [[communications satellite|satellite]] receiver used a microstrip tunnel diode amplifier (TDA) front-end in the 14 to 15.5&nbsp;GHz frequency band. Such amplifiers were considered state-of-the-art, with better performance at high frequencies than any [[transistor]]-based front end.<ref>Mott, R. C.

As voltage increases further, these states become increasingly misaligned and the current drops. This is called ''[[negative resistance]]'' because current decreases with increasing voltage. As voltage increases yet further, the diode begins to operate as a normal diode, where electrons travel by conduction across the p\u2013n junction, and no longer by tunneling through the p\u2013n junction barrier. The most important operating region for a tunnel diode is the negative resistance region. Its graph is different from normal p-n junction diode.\n\n==Reverse bias operation==\n{{main article|Backward diode}}\nWhen used in the reverse direction, tunnel diodes are called '''back diodes''' (or '''backward diodes''') and can act as fast [[rectifier]]s with zero offset voltage and extreme linearity for power signals (they have an accurate square law characteristic in the reverse direction). Under [[reverse bias]], filled states on the p-side become increasingly aligned with empty states on the n-side and electrons now tunnel through the pn junction barrier in reverse direction.\n\n==Technical comparisons==\n[[File:Voltage controlled negative resistance.svg|thumb|''IV'' curve similar to a tunnel diode characteristic curve. It has negative differential resistance in the shaded voltage region, between ''v<sub>1</sub>'' and ''v<sub>2</sub>.]]\n[[File:I-V curve of 10mA germanium tunnel diode..jpg|thumb|I-V curve of 10mA germanium tunnel diode, taken on a Tektronix model 571 [[curve tracer]].]]\nIn a conventional semiconductor diode, conduction takes place while the p\u2013n junction is forward biased and blocks current flow when the junction is reverse biased. This occurs up to a point known as the \"reverse breakdown voltage\" at which point conduction begins (often accompanied by destruction of the device). In the tunnel diode, the dopant concentrations in the p and n layers are increased to a level such that the '''reverse breakdown voltage''' becomes '''zero''' and the diode conducts in the reverse direction. However, when forward-biased, an effect occurs called [[quantum tunneling|quantum mechanical tunneling]] which gives rise to a region in its voltage-current behavior where an ''increase'' in forward voltage is accompanied by a ''decrease'' in forward current. This [[negative resistance]] region can be exploited in a solid state version of the [[dynatron oscillator]] which normally uses a [[tetrode]] thermionic valve ([[vacuum tube]]).\n\nThe tunnel diode showed great promise as an oscillator and high-frequency threshold (trigger) device since it operated at frequencies far greater than the tetrode could, well into the microwave bands. Applications for tunnel diodes included local oscillators for [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] television tuners, trigger circuits in [[oscilloscope]]s, high-speed counter circuits, and very fast-rise time pulse generator circuits. The tunnel diode can also be used as a low-noise microwave amplifier.<ref name=\"Fink\">Fink, pp. 13\u201364</ref> However, since its discovery, more conventional semiconductor devices have surpassed its performance using conventional oscillator techniques. For many purposes, a three-terminal device, such as a field-effect transistor, is more flexible than a device with only two terminals. Practical tunnel diodes operate at a few milliamperes and a few tenths of a volt, making them low-power devices.<ref>L.W. Turner,(ed), Electronics Engineer's Reference Book, 4th ed. Newnes-Butterworth, London 1976 ISBN 0-408-00168-2 pp. 8\u201318</ref> The [[Gunn diode]] has similar high frequency capability and can handle more power.\n\nTunnel diodes are also more [[radiation hardening|resistant to ionizing radiation]] than other diodes.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} This makes them well suited to higher radiation environments such as those found in space.\n\n===Longevity===\nTunnel diodes are notable for their longevity, with devices made in the 1960s still functioning. Writing in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', Esaki and coauthors state that semiconductor devices in general are extremely stable, and suggest that their [[shelf life]] should be \"infinite\" if kept at [[room temperature]]. They go on to report that a small-scale test of 50-year-old devices revealed a \"gratifying confirmation of the diode's longevity\". As noticed on some samples of Esaki diodes, the gold plated iron pins can in fact corrode and short out to the case. This can usually be diagnosed, and the diode inside normally still works.<ref name=\"esaki 2010\">{{cite journal |last=Esaki |first=Leo |last2=Arakawa |first2=Yasuhiko |last3=Kitamura |first3=Masatoshi|title=Esaki diode is still a radio star, half a century on|doi=10.1038/464031b |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |year=2010 |volume=464 |pages=31 |pmid=20203587 |issue=7285}}</ref>\n\nHowever, these components are susceptible to damage by overheating, and thus special care is needed when soldering them.\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|3}}\n*[[Avalanche diode]]\n<!-- *[[Bistable multivibrator]] -->\n*[[Gunn diode]]\n*[[IMPATT diode]]\n*[[Lambda diode]]\n*[[Resonant tunnelling diode]]\n*[[Tunnel junction]]\n*[[Zener diode]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*[[Donald G.
