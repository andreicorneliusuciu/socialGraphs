When used in such fashion, beacons can be considered a form of [[Telegraph#Optical telegraph|optical telegraphy]].\n\n== For navigation ==\n[[File:Beacon at Orontes Bank.jpg|right|thumb|A navigational beacon denoting the presence of Orontes Bank off [[Port Vincent, South Australia]].]]\n\nBeacons help guide [[navigation|navigators]] to their destinations. Types of navigational beacons include [[radar]] reflectors, [[radio beacons]], sonic and visual signals. Visual beacons range from small, single-pile structures to large [[lighthouse]]s or light stations and can be located on land or on water. Lighted beacons are called ''lights''; unlighted beacons are called ''[[Day beacon|daybeacon]]''s.\n\n== For defensive communications ==\n[[File:Culmstock, Culmstock Beacon - geograph.org.uk - 213525.jpg|thumb|left|16th-century beacon hut in Culmstock, Devon, England]]\n\nClassically, beacons were fires lit at well-known locations on hills or high places, used either as [[lighthouse]]s for [[navigational aid|navigation at sea]], or for signalling over land that enemy troops were approaching, in order to alert defenses. As signals, beacons are an ancient form of [[optical telegraph]]y, and were part of a [[relay league]].\n\nSystems of this kind have existed for centuries over much of the world. The ancient Romans used beacons and figure on several occasions on the [[column of Trajan]].\n\nIn the 10 century, during the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]], the [[Byzantine Empire]] used a [[Byzantine beacon system|beacon system]] to transmit messages from the border with the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], across [[Anatolia]] to the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|imperial palace]] in the Byzantine capital, [[Constantinople]]. It was devised by [[Leo the Mathematician]] for Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]], but either abolished or radically curtailed by Theophilos' son and successor, [[Michael III]].<ref name=\"ODB\">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Foss | first = Clive | authorlink=  | title = Beacon | editor-last=Kazhdan | editor-first=Alexander | editor-link=Alexander Kazhdan |year=1991 | encyclopedia =[[The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-504652-6 | pages=273\u2013274}}</ref> Beacons were later used in Greece as well, while the surviving parts of the beacon system in Anatolia seem to have been reactivated in the 12th century by Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]].<ref name=\"ODB\" />\n\nIn Scandinavia many [[hill fort]]s were part of beacon networks to warn against invading pillagers. In Finland these beacons were called ''vainovalkeat'', \"persecution fires\", or ''vartiotulet'', \"guard fires\", and were used to warn Finn settlements of imminent raids by the Vikings.\n\nIn [[Wales]], the [[Brecon Beacons]] were named for beacons used to warn of approaching English raiders. In England, the most famous examples are the beacons used in [[Elizabethan England]] to warn of the approaching [[Spanish Armada]]. Many hills in England were named Beacon Hill after such beacons. In the [[Scottish border]]s country, a system of beacon fires was at one time established to warn of incursions by the English. [[Hume Castle|Hume]] and Eggerstone castles and Soltra Edge were part of this network.<ref>Ritchie, Leitch (1835). ''Scott and Scotland''. London : Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green, and Longman, p. 53</ref> The [[Great Wall of China]] is also a beacon network.\n\nIn Spain, the border of [[Granada]] in the territory of the [[Crown of Castile]] had a complex beacon network to warn against Moorish raiders and military campaigns.<ref>Els almog\u00e1vers a la frontera amb el sarrains en el segle XIV. Maria Teresa Ferrer</ref>\n\n== On vehicles ==\n[[File:Beacon positions.jpg|thumb|Beacon positions on police car]]\n\nVehicular beacons are rotating or flashing lights affixed to the top of a vehicle to attract the attention of surrounding vehicles and pedestrians. [[Emergency vehicle]]s such as fire engines, ambulances, police cars, tow trucks, construction vehicles, and snow-removal vehicles carry beacon lights.\n\nThe color of the lamps varies by jurisdiction; typical colors are blue and/or red for police, fire, and medical-emergency vehicles; amber for hazards (slow-moving vehicles, wide loads, tow trucks, security personnel, construction vehicles, etc.); green for volunteer firefighters or for medical personnel, and violet for funerary vehicles. Beacons may be constructed with [[Automotive lamp types|halogen bulbs]] similar to those used in vehicle [[headlamp]]s, xenon [[flashtube]]s, or [[Light emitting diode|LEDs]].<ref>{{cite journal\n |title=Evaluation of Light-Emitting Diode Beacon Light Fixtures \n |journal=Lighting Research Center \u2013 Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute \n |date=December 2009 \n |first=John \n |last=Bullough \n |author2=Nicholas P Skinner \n |id= \n |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/trans-r-and-d-repository/LRCBeaconReport.pdf \n |format=PDF \n |accessdate=2010-06-05 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729142629/https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/trans-r-and-d-repository/LRCBeaconReport.pdf \n |archivedate=2013-07-29 \n |df= \n}}</ref> Incandescent and xenon light sources require the vehicle\u2019s engine to continue running to ensure that the battery is not depleted when the lights are used for a prolonged period. The low power consumption of LEDs allows the vehicle's engine to remain turned off while the lights operate nodes.\n\n== Other uses ==\nBeacons and [[bonfire]]s are also used to mark occasions and celebrate events.\n\nBeacons have also allegedly been abused by [[Wrecking (shipwreck)|shipwreckers]]. An illicit fire at a wrong position would be used to direct a ship against [[shoal]]s or [[beach]]es, so that its cargo could be looted after the ship sank or ran aground. There are, however, no historically substantiated occurrences of such intentional shipwrecking.\n\nIn wireless networks, a [[Electric beacon#IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi beacons|beacon]] is a type of [[Frame (networking)|frame]] which is sent by the access point (or WiFi router) to indicate that it is on.\n\nBluetooth based beacons periodically send out a data packet and this could be used by software to identify the beacon location. This is typically used by indoor navigation and positioning applications.\n\n''Beaconing'' is the process that allows a network to self-repair network problems. The stations on the network notify the other stations on the ring when they are not receiving the transmissions. Beaconing is used in Token ring and FDDI networks.\n\n=== In fiction ===\nIn [[Aeschylus]]' tragedy ''[[Oresteia|Agamemnon]]'',<ref>v. 281 ''et sqq.''</ref> a chain of eight beacons manned by so-called ''lampad\u00f3phoroi'' inform [[Clytemnestra]] in [[Argos]], within a single night's time, that [[Troy]] has just fallen under her husband king Agamemnon's control, after a famous [[Trojan War|ten years siege]].\n\nIn [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[high fantasy]] novel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', a [[Gondor#Warning Beacons of Gondor|series of beacons]] alerts the entire realm of [[Gondor]] when the kingdom is under attack. These beacon posts were manned by messengers who would carry word of their lighting to either [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] or [[Gondor#Belfalas|Belfalas]].<ref name=TolkienLotR>{{cite book|last=Tolkien|first=J. R. R.|title=The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition)|year=2004|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|volume=''The Return of the King''|pages=747\u2013748}}</ref>  In [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|film adaptation of the novel]], the beacons serve as a connection between the two realms of Rohan and Gondor, alerting one another directly when they require military aid, as opposed to relying on messengers as in the novel.\n=== In retail ===\nBeacons are sometimes used in retail to send digital coupons or invites to customers passing by.
