The notation <math>A\\ang \\!\\ \\theta, </math>&nbsp; for a vector with magnitude (or ''amplitude'') ''A'' and phase angle \u03b8, is called [[angle notation]].\n\nThis notation is frequently used to represent an [[electrical impedance]].  In this case the phase angle is the phase difference between the voltage applied to the impedance and the current driven through it.\n\nIn the context of periodic phenomena, such as a [[Sine wave|wave]], ''phase angle'' is synonymous with [[Phase (waves)|phase]].\n\n==Bioelectric impedance==\nIn [[bioelectrical impedance analysis]] in humans, an estimate of the phase angle can be obtained and is based on changes in resistance and reactance as alternating current passes through tissues, which causes a phase shift. The measured phase angle therefore depends on several biological factors. Phase angle is greater in men than women, and decreases with increasing age.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barbosa-Silva|first1=MC|title=Bioelectrical impedance analysis: population reference values for phase angle by age and sex|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=2005|volume=82|issue=1|pages=49\u201352|pmid=16002799|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/82/1/49.long|accessdate=3 April 2016|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{FS1037C}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-timedelayphase.htm Calculation of phase angle (phase difference) from time delay (time of arrival ITD) and frequency - Connection between phase, phase angle, frequency, and time of arrival (delay)]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Phase Angle}}\n[[Category:Angle]]\n[[Category:Wave mechanics]]"}]}}}}
