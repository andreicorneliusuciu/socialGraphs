It is also referred to as a '''maximally flat magnitude filter'''. It was first described in 1930 by the British [[engineer]] and [[physicist]] [[Stephen Butterworth]] in his paper entitled \"On the Theory of Filter Amplifiers\".<ref name=\"1930paper\">In ''Wireless Engineer'' (also called ''Experimental Wireless and the Wireless Engineer''), vol. 7, 1930, pp. 536\u2013541 - [http://www.gonascent.com/papers/butter.pdf \"On the Theory of Filter Amplifiers\"-S. Butterworth]</ref>\n\n== Original paper ==\n\n{{Linear analog electronic filter|filter2=hide|filter3=hide}}\n\nButterworth had a reputation for solving \"impossible\" mathematical problems. At the time, [[filter design]] required a considerable amount of designer experience due to limitations of the [[image parameter filter|theory then in use]]. The filter was not in common use for over 30 years after its publication. Butterworth stated that: {{quote|\"An ideal electrical filter should not only completely reject the unwanted frequencies but should also have uniform sensitivity for the wanted frequencies\".}}\n\nSuch an ideal filter cannot be achieved but Butterworth showed that successively closer approximations were obtained with increasing numbers of filter elements of the right values.  At the time, filters generated substantial ripple in the passband, and the choice of component values was highly interactive. Butterworth showed that a [[low pass filter]] could be designed whose cutoff frequency was normalized to 1 radian per second and whose frequency response ([[gain (electronics)|gain]]) was\n\n:<math>G(\\omega) = {\\frac{1} \\sqrt{1+{\\omega}^{2n}}},</math>\n\nwhere \u03c9 is the [[angular frequency]] in radians per second and ''n'' is the number of [[Pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s in the filter\u2014equal to the number of reactive elements in a passive filter. If \u03c9&nbsp;= 1, the amplitude response of this type of filter in the passband is 1/{{sqrt|2}}&nbsp;\u2248 0.707, which is half power or &minus;3 [[decibel|dB]].  Butterworth only dealt with filters with an even number of poles in his paper.  He may have been unaware that such filters could be designed with an odd number of poles. He built his higher order filters from 2-pole filters separated by vacuum tube amplifiers.  His plot of the frequency response of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 pole filters is shown as A, B, C, D, and E in his original graph.\n\nButterworth solved the equations for two- and four-pole filters, showing how the latter could be cascaded when separated by [[vacuum tube]] [[amplifier]]s and so enabling the construction of higher-order filters despite [[inductor]] losses. In 1930, low-loss core materials such as [[Molypermalloy Powder Core|molypermalloy]] had not been discovered and air-cored audio inductors were rather lossy.  Butterworth discovered that it was possible to adjust the component values of the filter to compensate for the winding resistance of the inductors.\n\nHe used coil forms of 1.25\u2033 diameter and 3\u2033 length with plug-in terminals.  Associated capacitors and resistors were contained inside the wound coil form.  The coil formed part of the plate load resistor.  Two poles were used per vacuum tube and RC coupling was used to the grid of the following tube.\n\nButterworth also showed that his basic low-pass filter could be modified to give [[low-pass filter|low-pass]], [[high-pass filter|high-pass]], [[band-pass filter|band-pass]] and [[band-stop filter|band-stop]] functionality.\n\n== Overview ==\n\n[[File:Butterworth filter bode plot.svg|thumb|right|350px|The [[Bode plot]] of a first-order Butterworth low-pass filter]]\n\nThe frequency response of the Butterworth filter is maximally flat (i.e. has no [[ripple (filters)|ripples]]) in the passband and rolls off towards zero in the stopband.<ref name=bianchi>\n{{cite book\n | title = Electronic filter simulation & design\n | author = Giovanni Bianchi and Roberto Sorrentino\n | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional\n | year = 2007\n | isbn = 978-0-07-149467-0\n | pages = 17\u201320\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5S3LCIxnYCcC&pg=PT32&dq=Butterworth-approximation+maximally-flat#v=onepage&q=Butterworth-approximation%20maximally-flat&f=false\n }}</ref>\nWhen viewed on a logarithmic [[Bode plot]], the response slopes off linearly towards negative infinity. A first-order filter's response rolls off at \u22126 dB per [[Octave (electronics)|octave]] (\u221220 dB per [[Decade (log scale)|decade]]) (all first-order lowpass filters have the same normalized frequency response). A second-order filter decreases at \u221212 dB per octave, a third-order at \u221218 dB and so on. Butterworth filters have a monotonically changing magnitude function with \u03c9, unlike other filter types that have non-monotonic ripple in the passband and/or the stopband.\n\nCompared with a [[Chebyshev filter|Chebyshev]] Type I/Type II filter or an [[elliptic filter]], the Butterworth filter has a slower [[roll-off]], and thus will require a higher order to implement a particular [[stopband]] specification, but Butterworth filters have a more linear phase response in the pass-band than Chebyshev Type I/Type II and elliptic filters can achieve.\n\n== Example ==\n\nA transfer function of a third-order low-pass Butterworth filter design shown in the figure on the right looks like this:\n\n:<math>\\frac{V_o(s)}{V_i(s)}=\\frac{R}{s^3(L_1 C_2 L_3) + s^2(L_1 C_2 R) + s(L_1 + L_3) + R}.</math>\n\n[[File:LowPass3poleICauer.svg|300px|right|thumb|A third-order low-pass filter ([[Cauer topology]]).

The gain and the delay for this filter are plotted in the graph on the left. It can be seen that there are no ripples in the gain curve in either the passband or the stop band.\n\nThe log of the absolute value of the transfer function ''H(s)'' is plotted in complex frequency space in the second graph on the right. The function is defined by the three poles in the left half of the complex frequency plane.

The gain function will have three more poles on the right half plane to complete the circle.\n\nBy replacing each inductor with a capacitor and each capacitor with an inductor, a high-pass Butterworth filter is obtained.\n\nA band-pass Butterworth filter is obtained by placing a capacitor in series with each inductor and an inductor in parallel with each capacitor to form resonant circuits.  The value of each new component must be selected to resonate with the old component at the frequency of interest.\n\nA band-stop Butterworth filter is obtained by placing a capacitor in parallel with each inductor and an inductor in series with each capacitor to form resonant circuits.  The value of each new component must be selected to resonate with the old component at the frequency to be rejected.\n\n== Transfer function ==\n\n[[File:Butterworth Filter Orders.svg|thumb|350px|left|Plot of the gain of Butterworth low-pass filters of orders 1 through 5, with [[cutoff frequency]] <math>\\omega_0 = 1</math>. Note that the slope is 20''n'' dB/decade where ''n'' is the filter order.]]\n\nLike all filters, the typical [[prototype filter|prototype]] is the low-pass filter, which can be modified into a high-pass filter, or placed in series with others to form [[band-pass]] and [[band-stop]] filters, and higher order versions of these.\n\nThe gain <math>G(\\omega)</math> of an ''n''-order Butterworth low pass filter is given in terms of the transfer function ''H(s)'' as\n:<math>G^2(\\omega)=\\left |H(j\\omega)\\right|^2 = \\frac {{G_0}^2}{1+\\left(\\frac{j\\omega}{j\\omega_c}\\right)^{2n}}</math>\n\nwhere\n* n = order of filter\n* \u03c9<sub>c</sub> = [[cutoff frequency]] (approximately the -3dB frequency)\n* <math>G_0</math> is the DC gain (gain at zero frequency)\n\nIt can be seen that as ''n'' approaches infinity, the gain becomes a rectangle function and frequencies below \u03c9<sub>c</sub> will be passed with gain <math>G_0</math>, while frequencies above \u03c9<sub>c</sub> will be suppressed. For smaller values of ''n'', the cutoff will be less sharp.\n\nWe wish to determine the transfer function ''H(s)'' where <math>s=\\sigma+j\\omega</math> (from [[Laplace transform]]). Because <math>\\left|H(s)\\right|^2 = H(s)\\overline{H(s)}</math> and, as a general property of Laplace transforms at <math>s=j\\omega</math>, <math>H(-j\\omega) = \\overline{H(j\\omega)}</math>, if we select H(s) such that:\n\n:<math>H(s)H(-s) = \\frac {{G_0}^2}{1+\\left (\\frac{-s^2}{\\omega_c^2}\\right)^n},</math>\n\nthen, for imaginary inputs, <math>s=j\\omega</math>, we have the frequency response of the Butterworth filter.\n\nThe ''n'' poles of this expression occur on a circle of radius \u03c9<sub>c</sub> at equally-spaced points, and symmetric around the imaginary axis. For stability, the transfer function, H(s), is therefore chosen such that it contains only the poles in the negative real half-plane of ''s''. The ''k''-th pole is specified by\n\n:<math>-\\frac{s_k^2}{\\omega_c^2} = (-1)^{\\frac{1}{n}} = e^{\\frac{j(2k-1)\\pi}{n}}\n\\qquad k = 1,2,3,\\ldots, n</math>\n\nand hence;\n\n:<math>s_k = \\omega_c e^{\\frac{j(2k+n-1)\\pi}{2n}}\\qquad k = 1,2,3,\\ldots, n.</math>\n\nThe transfer( or system) function may be written in terms of these poles as\n\n:<math>H(s)=\\frac{G_0}{\\prod_{k=1}^n (s-s_k)/\\omega_c}.</math>\n\nThe denominator is a Butterworth polynomial in ''s''.\n\n===Normalized Butterworth polynomials===\n\nThe Butterworth polynomials may be written in complex form as above, but are usually written with real coefficients by multiplying that pole pairs that are complex conjugates, such as <math>s_1</math> and <math>s_n</math>. The polynomials are normalized by setting  <math>\\omega_c=1</math>. The normalized Butterworth polynomials then have the general form\n\n:<math>B_n(s)=\\prod_{k=1}^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\left[s^2-2s\\cos\\left(\\frac{2k+n-1}{2n}\\,\\pi\\right)+1\\right]\\qquad n = \\text{even}</math>\n:<math>B_n(s)=(s+1)\\prod_{k=1}^{\\frac{n-1}{2}} \\left[s^2-2s\\cos\\left(\\frac{2k+n-1}{2n}\\,\\pi\\right)+1\\right]\\qquad n = \\text{odd}.</math>\n\nTo four decimal places, they are\n\n<center>\n{|\n|-----\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!n!!Factors of Polynomial <math>B_n(s)</math>\n|-\n!1\n|<math>(s+1)</math>\n|-\n!2\n|<math>(s^2+1.4142s+1)</math>\n|-\n!3\n|<math>(s+1)(s^2+s+1)</math>\n|-\n!4\n|<math>(s^2+0.7654s+1)(s^2+1.8478s+1)</math>\n|-\n!5\n|<math>(s+1)(s^2+0.6180s+1)(s^2+1.6180s+1)</math>\n|-\n!6\n|<math>(s^2+0.5176s+1)(s^2+1.4142s+1)(s^2+1.9319s+1)</math>\n|-\n!7\n|<math>(s+1)(s^2+0.4450s+1)(s^2+1.2470s+1)(s^2+1.8019s+1)</math>\n|-\n!8\n|<math>(s^2+0.3902s+1)(s^2+1.1111s+1)(s^2+1.6629s+1)(s^2+1.9616s+1)</math>\n|}\n|}</center>\n\nThe normalized Butterworth polynomials can be used to determine the transfer function for any low-pass filter cut-off frequency <math>\\omega_c</math>, as follows\n\n:<math>H(s) = \\frac{G_0}{B_n(a)}</math> , where <math>a = \\frac{s}{\\omega_c}.</math>\n\nTransformation to other bandforms are also possible, see [[prototype filter]].\n\n===Maximal flatness===\n\nAssuming <math>\\omega_c=1</math> and <math>G_0=1</math>, the derivative of the gain with respect to frequency can be shown to be\n\n:<math>\\frac{dG}{d\\omega}=-nG^3\\omega^{2n-1}</math>\n\nwhich is [[monotonic]]ally decreasing for all <math>\\omega</math> since the gain ''G'' is always positive. The gain function of the Butterworth filter therefore has no ripple. Furthermore, the series expansion of the gain is given by\n\n:<math>G(\\omega)=1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\omega^{2n}+\\frac{3}{8}\\omega^{4n}+\\ldots</math>\n\nIn other words, all derivatives of the gain up to but not including the 2''n''-th derivative are zero at <math>\\omega=0</math>, resulting in \"maximal flatness\". If the requirement to be monotonic is limited to the passband only and ripples are allowed in the stopband, then it is possible to design a filter of the same order, such as the [[inverse Chebyshev filter]], that is flatter in the passband than the \"maximally flat\" Butterworth.\n\n===High-frequency roll-off===\n\nAgain assuming <math>\\omega_c=1</math>, the slope of the log of the gain for large \u03c9 is\n\n:<math>\\lim_{\\omega\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{d\\log(G)}{d\\log(\\omega)}=-n.</math>\n\nIn [[decibel]]s, the high-frequency roll-off is therefore 20''n'' dB/decade, or 6''n'' dB/octave (the factor of 20 is used because the power is proportional to the square of the voltage gain; see [[20 log rule]].)\n\n==Filter design==\n\nThere are several different [[electronic filter topology|filter topologies]] available to implement a linear analogue filter. The most often used topology for a passive realisation is Cauer topology and the most often used topology for an active realisation is Sallen\u2013Key topology.\n\n=== Cauer topology ===\n\n[[File:Cauer lowpass.svg|right|450px|Butterworth filter using [[Cauer topology (electronics)|Cauer topology]]]]\n\nThe [[Cauer topology (electronics)|Cauer topology]] uses passive components (shunt capacitors and series inductors) to implement a linear analog filter. The Butterworth filter having a given transfer function can be realised using a Cauer&nbsp;1-form. The ''k''-th element is given by\n\n:<math>C_k = 2 \\sin \\left [\\frac {(2k-1)}{2n} \\pi \\right ]\\qquad k = \\text{odd}</math>\n\n:<math>L_k = 2 \\sin \\left [\\frac {(2k-1)}{2n} \\pi \\right ]\\qquad k = \\text{even}.</math>\n\nThe filter may start with a series inductor if desired, in which case the ''L<sub>k</sub>'' are ''k'' odd and the ''C<sub>k</sub>'' are ''k'' even.\nThese formulae may usefully be combined by making both ''L<sub>k</sub>'' and ''C<sub>k</sub>'' equal to ''g<sub>k</sub>''.  That is, ''g<sub>k</sub>'' is the [[immittance]] divided by ''s''.\n\n:<math>g_k = 2 \\sin \\left [\\frac {(2k-1)}{2n} \\pi \\right ]\\qquad k = 1,2,3, \\ldots, n.</math>\n\nThese formulae apply to a doubly terminated filter (that is, the source and load impedance are both equal to unity) with &omega;<sub>c</sub> = 1.  This [[prototype filter]] can be scaled for other values of impedance and frequency.  For a singly terminated filter (that is, one driven by an ideal voltage or current source) the element values are given by<ref>Matthaei, pp. 104-107</ref>\n\n:<math>g_j = \\frac{a_j a_{j-1}}{c_{j-1} g_{j-1}}\\qquad j = 2,3, \\ldots, n</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>g_1 = a_1</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>a_j = \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\left [\\frac {(2j-1)}{n} \\right ]\\qquad j = 1,2,3, \\ldots, n</math>\n:<math>c_j = \\cos^2 \\left [\\frac{\\pi j}{2n} \\right ]\\qquad j = 1,2,3, \\ldots, n.</math>\n\nVoltage driven filters must start with a series element and current driven filters must start with a shunt element.  These forms are useful in the design of [[diplexer]]s and [[multiplexer]]s.<ref>Matthaei, pp. 105,974</ref>\n\n=== Sallen\u2013Key topology ===\n\n[[File:Sallen-Key.svg|right|300px|[[Sallen\u2013Key topology]]]]\n\nThe [[Sallen\u2013Key topology]] uses active and passive components (noninverting buffers, usually [[op amp]]s, resistors, and capacitors) to implement a linear analog filter. Each Sallen\u2013Key stage implements a conjugate pair of poles; the overall filter is implemented by cascading all stages in series.  If there is a real pole (in the case where <math>n</math> is odd), this must be implemented separately, usually as an [[RC circuit]], and cascaded with the active stages.\n\nFor the second-order Sallen\u2013Key circuit shown to the right the transfer function is given by\n\n:<math>H(s)=\\frac{V_{out}(s)}{V_{in}(s)}=\\frac{1}{1+C_2(R_1+R_2)s+C_1C_2R_1R_2s^2}.</math>\n\nWe wish the denominator to be one of the quadratic terms in a Butterworth polynomial. Assuming that <math>\\omega_c=1</math>, this will mean that\n\n:<math>C_1C_2R_1R_2=1\\,</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>C_2(R_1+R_2)=-2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2k+n-1}{2n} \\pi\\right).</math>\n\nThis leaves two undefined component values that may be chosen at will.\n\n===Digital implementation===\n\nDigital implementations of Butterworth and other filters are often based on the [[bilinear transform]] method or the [[matched Z-transform method]], two different methods to discretize an analog filter design.  In the case of all-pole filters such as the Butterworth, the matched Z-transform method is equivalent to the [[impulse invariance]] method.  For higher orders, digital filters are sensitive to quantization errors, so they are often calculated as cascaded [[Digital biquad filter|biquad sections]], plus one first-order or third-order section for odd orders.\n\n==Comparison with other linear filters==\n\nProperties of the Butterworth filter are:\n* [[Monotonic function|monotonic]] [[frequency response|amplitude response]] in both passband and stopband\n* Quick [[roll-off]] around the cutoff frequency, which improves with increasing order\n* Considerable [[overshoot (signal)|overshoot]] and [[ringing (signal)|ringing]] in [[step response]], which worsens with increasing order\n* Slightly non-linear [[phase response]]\n* [[Group delay]] largely frequency-dependent\n\nHere is an image showing the gain of a discrete-time Butterworth filter next to other common filter types. All of these filters are fifth-order.\n\n[[File:Electronic linear filters.svg|500px|center]]\n\nThe Butterworth filter rolls off more slowly around the cutoff frequency than the [[Chebyshev filter]] or the [[Elliptic filter]], but without ripple.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n*Matthaei, George L.; Young, Leo and Jones, E.
