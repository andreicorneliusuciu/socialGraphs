Fluids are a subset of the [[Phase (matter)|phases]] of [[matter]] and include [[liquid]]s, gases, [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]] and, to some extent, [[plasticity (physics)|plastic solids]]. Fluids are [[Matter|substances]] that have zero shear modulus or, in simpler terms, a fluid is a substance which cannot resist any [[shear force]] applied to it.\n\nFluids mechanics and fluids dynamics are often used to calculate fluids flows in a first aproach. In a second approach, depending on the scales, a material can appear as a '''fluid''' or as a '''slurry''' like, for example, blood, milk or resins. In a certain volume bigger than 1mm<sup>3</sup>, it can be considered as a fluid but in smaller ones, especially close to edges, in smears or filtrations, the substance can change of properties. Cells that are present in suspension are bigger than 1micrometer and they break the continuous deformation of the substence at this scale. For example, blood separates into a plug and sheath flow as showed by <ref name=\"ReferenceA\">GB Thurston, Viscosity and viscoelasticity of blood in small diameter tubes, Microvasular Research 11, 133 146, 1976</ref>. In centrifugation, as well, there is a separation : with milk we can make cream and butter. Blood centrifugation is a separation process. At rest, blood sedimentates. A fluid does not separate, does not sedimentate. \n\nAlthough the term \"fluid\" includes both the liquid and gas phases, in common usage, \"fluid\" is often used as a synonym for \"liquid\", with no implication that gas could also be present. For example, \"[[brake fluid]]\" is [[hydraulic oil]] and will not perform its required [[incompressible]] function if there is gas in it. This colloquial usage of the term is also common in medicine and in nutrition (\"take plenty of fluids\").\n\nLiquids form a [[free surface]] (that is, a surface not created by the container) while gases do not. The distinction between [[plasticity (physics)|solids]] and fluid is not entirely obvious. The distinction is made by evaluating the [[viscosity]] of the substance.  [[Silly Putty]] can be considered to behave like a solid or a fluid, depending on the time period over which it is observed.  It is best described as a [[viscoelastic]] fluid. There are many examples of substances proving difficult to classify. A particularly interesting one is [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]], as demonstrated in the [[pitch drop experiment]] currently running at the [[University of Queensland]].\n\n==Physics== \nFluids display properties such as:\n* not resisting deformation, or resisting it only slightly ([[viscosity]]), and\n* the ability to flow (also described as the ability to take on the shape of the container).This also means that all liquids have the property of fluidity.\nThese properties are typically a function of their inability to support a [[shear stress]] in static [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]].\n\nSolids can be subjected to shear stresses, and to [[normal stress]]es\u2014both [[Compressive stress|compressive]] and [[Tensile stress|tensile]].  In contrast, ideal fluids can only be subjected to normal, compressive stress which is called [[pressure]].  Real fluids display viscosity and so are capable of being subjected to low levels of shear stress.\n\n===Modelling===\n{{main|Fluid mechanics}}\nIn a solid, shear stress is a function of [[Strain (materials science)|strain]], but in a fluid, [[stress (physics)|shear stress]] is a function of [[strain rate]]. A consequence of this behavior is [[Pascal's law]] which describes the role of [[pressure]] in characterizing a fluid's state. \n\nDepending on the relationship between shear stress, and the rate of strain and its [[derivative]]s, fluids can be characterized as one of the following:\n*[[Newtonian fluid]]s: where stress is directly proportional to rate of strain\n*[[Non-Newtonian fluid]]s: where stress is not proportional to rate of strain, its higher powers and derivatives.\n\nThe behavior of fluids can be described by the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]\u2014a set of [[partial differential equations]] which are based on:\n* continuity ([[continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|conservation of mass]]),\n* conservation of [[linear momentum]],\n* conservation of [[angular momentum]],\n* [[conservation of energy]].\n\nThe study of fluids is [[fluid mechanics]], which is subdivided into [[fluid dynamics]] and [[fluid statics]] depending on whether the fluid is in motion.\n\nFluids mechanics and fluids dynamics are often used to calculate fluids flows in a first aproach.
