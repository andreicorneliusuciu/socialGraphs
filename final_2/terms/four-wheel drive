Typical AWD systems work well on all surfaces, but are not intended for more extreme off-road use.<ref name=\"Sheppard\"/>  When used to describe AWD systems in light passenger vehicles it describes a system that either applies power to all four wheels (permanently or on demand) and targeted as improving on road traction and performance, particularly in inclement conditions, rather than for off road applications.<ref name=CR/>\n\nSome all wheel drive electric vehicles solve this challenge using one motor for each axle, thereby eliminating a mechanical differential between the front and rear axles. An example of this is the [[Tesla Model S#Dual-motor all-wheel-drive versions|dual motor]] variant of the [[Tesla Model S]], which on a millisecond scale can control the power distribution electronically between its two motors.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.wired.com/2014/10/tesla-reveals-details-big-model-d-announcement/ |title=The Model D Is Tesla\u2019s Most Powerful Car Ever, Plus Autopilot |last=Davies |first=Alex |date=2014-10-10 |publisher=[[Wired (website)|Wired.com]] |accessdate=2014-10-11|quote=Musk said the added efficiency is thanks to the electronic system that will shift power between the front and rear motors from one millisecond to the next, so each is always operating at its most efficient point}}</ref>\n\n===IWD===\n'''[[Individual-wheel drive]] (IWD)''' was coined to identify those electric vehicles whereby each wheel is driven by its own individual electric motor. This system essentially has inherent characteristics that would be generally attributed to four-wheel drive systems like the distribution of the available power to the wheels. However, because of the inherent characteristics of electric motors, torque can be negative, as seen in the [[Rimac Concept One]] and [[Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG#SLS AMG Electric Drive .282013.E2.80.93.29|SLS AMG Electric]]. This can have drastic effects, as in better handling in tight corners.<ref>http://www.carscoops.com/2013/04/harris-helps-us-understand-negative.html</ref>\n\nThe term ''IWD'' can refer to a vehicle with any number of wheels. For example, the [[Mars rover]]s are 6-wheel IWD.\n\n==Design==\n\n===Differentials===\n{{main|Differential (mechanical device)|l1=Differential}}\n[[File:Lamborghini Murci\u00e9lago LP-640 - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot (7) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Lamborghini Murci\u00e9lago]] is an AWD that powers the front via a [[viscous coupling unit]] if the rear slips.]]\n[[File:Hmmwv-036.jpg|thumb|right|The [[HMMWV]] is a 4WD/AWD that powers all wheels evenly (continuously) via a manually lockable center differential, with [[Torsen]] differentials for both front and rear.]]\n\nTwo wheels fixed to the same axle turn at the same speed as a vehicle goes around curves. This either forces one to slip, if possible, to balance the apparent distance covered, or creates uncomfortable and mechanically stressful wheel hop.  To prevent this the wheels are allowed to turn at different speeds using a mechanical or hydraulic [[differential (mechanics)|differential]]. This allows one [[driveshaft]] to independently drive two output shafts, axles that go from the differential to the wheel, at different speeds.\n\nThe differential does this by distributing angular force (in the form of [[torque]]) evenly, while distributing [[angular velocity]] (turning speed) such that the average for the two output shafts is equal to that of the differential [[ring gear]]. When powered each axle requires a differential to distribute power between the left and right sides. When power is distributed to all four wheels a third or 'center' differential can be used to distribute power between the front and rear axles.\n\nThe described system handles extremely well, as it is able to accommodate various forces of movement and distribute power evenly and smoothly, making slippage unlikely. Once it does slip, however, recovery is difficult. If the left front wheel of a 4WD vehicle slips on an icy patch of road, for instance, the slipping wheel will spin faster than the other wheels due to the lower traction at that wheel. Since a differential applies equal torque to each half-shaft, power is reduced at the other wheels, even if they have good traction. This problem can happen in both 2WD and 4WD vehicles, whenever a driven wheel is placed on a surface with little traction or raised off the ground. The simplistic design works acceptably well for 2WD vehicles. It is much less acceptable for 4WD vehicles, because 4WD vehicles have twice as many wheels with which to lose traction, increasing the likelihood that it may happen. 4WD vehicles may also be more likely to drive on surfaces with reduced traction. However, since torque is divided amongst four wheels rather than two, each wheel receives approximately half the torque of a 2WD vehicle, reducing the potential for wheel slip.\n\n[[File:Differential switches.svg|thumb|right|To prevent slippage from happening some vehicles have controls for independently locking center, front, and rear differentials]]\n\n===Limiting slippage===\n{{main|Limited-slip differential|l1=Limited-slip differential (LSD)}}\nMany differentials have no way of limiting the amount of engine power that gets sent to its attached output shafts. As a result, if a tire loses traction on acceleration, either because of a low-traction situation (e.g., - driving on gravel or ice) or the engine power overcomes available traction, the tire that is not slipping receives little or no power from the engine. In very low traction situations, this can prevent the vehicle from moving at all. To overcome this, there are several designs of differentials that can either limit the amount of slip (these are called 'limited-slip' differentials) or temporarily lock the two output shafts together to ensure that engine power reaches all driven wheels equally.\n\n[[Locking differential]]s work by temporarily locking together a differential's output shafts, causing all wheels to turn at the same rate, providing torque in case of slippage. This is generally used for the center differential, which distributes power between the front and the rear axles. While a drivetrain that turns all wheels equally would normally fight the driver and cause handling problems, this is not a concern when wheels are slipping.\n\nThe two most common factory-installed locking differentials use either a computer-controlled [[multi-plate clutch]] or [[viscous coupling unit]] to join the shafts, while other differentials more commonly used on off-road vehicles generally use manually operated locking devices. In the multi-plate clutch the vehicle's computer senses slippage and locks the shafts, causing a small jolt when it activates, which can disturb the driver or cause additional traction loss. In the viscous coupling differentials the [[shear stress]] of high shaft speed differences causes a [[dilatant]] fluid in the differential to become solid, linking the two shafts. This design suffers from fluid degradation with age and from [[Exponential growth|exponential]] locking behavior.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Some designs use gearing to create a small rotational difference that hastens torque transfer.\n\nA third approach to limiting slippage is taken by a [[Torsen]] differential. A Torsen differential allows the output shafts to receive different amounts of torque. This design does not provide for traction when one wheel is spinning freely, where there is no torque, but provides excellent handling in less extreme situations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} A typical Torsen II differential can deliver up to twice as much torque to the high traction side before traction is exceeded at the lower traction side.\n\nA fairly recent innovation in automobiles is electronic [[Traction control system|traction control]]. Traction control typically uses a vehicle's braking system to slow a spinning wheel. This forced slowing emulates the function of a limited-slip differential, and, by using the brakes more aggressively to ensure wheels are being driven at the same speed, can also emulate a locking differential. It should be noted that this technique normally requires wheel sensors to detect when a wheel is slipping, and only activates when wheel slip is detected. Therefore, there is typically no mechanism to actively prevent wheel slip (i.e., you can't \"lock the differential\" in advance of wheel slip), rather the system is designed to expressly permit wheel slip to occur, and then attempt to send torque to the wheels with the best traction.  If preventing all-wheel slip is a requirement, this is a limiting design.\n\n===Operating modes===\nThe architecture of an AWD/4WD system can be described by describing its possible operating modes.<ref name=Mohan>{{cite journal|last1=Mohan|first1=Sankar|title=All - Wheel Drive / Four - Wheel Drive Systems and Strategies|journal=Seoul 2000 FISITA World Automotive Congres|date=June 12, 2000|url=http://210.101.116.115/fisita/pdf/A014.pdf|ref=F2000A014}}</ref>  A single vehicle may have the ability to operate in multiple modes depending on driver selection.  Mohan describes the modes as follows:\n<blockquote>'''Two Wheel Drive (2WD) Mode''' - In this mode only one axle (typically the rear axle) is driven.  The drive to the other axle is disconnected. The operating torque split ratio is 0:100. \n'''Four Wheel Drive (4WD) Mode''' - Here, depending on the nature of torque transfer to the axles, we can define three sub-modes (below).\n:'''Part-time Mode''' - The front and rear axle drives are rigidly coupled in the transfer case. Since the driveline does not permit any speed differentiation between the axles and would cause driveline wind-up, this mode is recommended only for \u2018part-time\u2019 use in off-road or loose surface conditions where driveline wind-up is unlikely.  Depending on the road condition and the weight over the axles, up to full torque could go to either axle. \n:'''Full-time Mode''' - Both axles are driven at all times, but an inter-axle differential permits the axles to turn at different speeds as needed.  This allows the vehicle to be driven \u2018full-time\u2019 in this mode, irrespective of the nature of the road surface, without fear of driveline wind-up.  With standard bevel gear differentials the torque split is 50:50. Planetary differentials can provide asymmetric torque splits as needed.  A system that operates permanently in the full-time mode is sometimes called the \u2018All-the-Time 4WD\u2019, 'All-Wheel-Drive' or \u2018AWD\u2019.  If the inter-axle differential is locked out, then the mode reverts to a \u2018part-time mode\u2019. \n:'''On-Demand Mode''' - In this mode, the transfer case operates primarily in the 2WD mode.  Torque is transferred to the secondary axle \u2018on-demand\u2019 or as needed, by modulating the transfer clutch from \u2018open\u2019 to a rigidly coupled state, while avoiding any driveline wind-up.  The torque modulation may be achieved by active electronic/hydraulic control systems, or by passive devices, based on wheel slip or wheel torque, as described in the section on traction control systems.      \nIn addition to these basic modes, there could be implementations that combine these modes.  For example, the system could have a clutch across the center differential, capable of modulating the front axle torque from a Full-time mode with the 30:70 torque split of the center differential rather than from the 0:100 torque split of the 2WD mode</blockquote>\n\n==History==\n[[File:1903-Spyker-60-HP-1920x1440.jpg|thumb|The 1903 Spyker 60 H.P. 4WD]]\n[[File:1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo - Blackberry with Crimson interior 17.jpg|thumb|Center transfer case sending power from the transmission to the rear axle (right) and front axle (left)]]\n[[File:Transfer lever 4wd gnangarra.jpg|thumb|Selection lever: 2H for two-wheel drive, 4H for high-range 4WD, 4L for low-range 4WD, and N for Neutral]]\n\n===Early 1900s===\nIn 1893, before the establishment of a modern automotive industry in Britain, English engineer [[Bramah Joseph Diplock]] patented a four-wheel-drive system for a [[traction engine]], including four-wheel steering and three [[Differential (mechanical device)|differentials]], which was subsequently built.  The development also incorporated Bramah's [[Pedrail wheel]] system in what was one of the first four-wheel-drive automobiles to display an intentional ability to travel on challenging road surfaces. It stemmed from Bramagh's previous idea of developing an engine that would reduce the amount of damage to public roads.\n\n[[Ferdinand Porsche]] designed and built a four-wheel-driven [[electric vehicle]] for the ''k. u. k. Hofwagenfabrik Ludwig Lohner & Co.'' at Vienna in 1899, presented to the public during the 1900 World Exhibition at Paris. An electric [[hub motor]] at each wheel powered the vehicle. Although clumsily heavy, the vehicle proved a powerful sprinter and record-breaker in the hands of its owner E.W. Hart. Due to its unusual status the so-called ''[[Lohner-Porsche]]'' is not widely credited as the first four-wheel-driven automobile.\n\nThe first four-wheel-drive car, as well as hill-climb racer, with internal combustion engine, the ''[[Spyker]] 60 H.P.'', was presented in 1903 by Dutch brothers Jacobus and Hendrik-Jan Spijker of [[Amsterdam]].<ref name=\"Henry, A. 1975\">{{cite book| last=Henry |first=Allan |title=The 4-Wheel Drives: Racing's Formula for Failure? |publisher=Macmillan |year=1975}}</ref><ref name=\"1903 Spyker 60 HP\">{{cite web | url=http://www.seriouswheels.com/cars/top-1903-Spyker-60-HP.htm |title=1903 Spyker 60 HP |accessdate=6 May 2011}}</ref> The two-seat sports car, which was also the first ever car equipped with a six-cylinder engine, is now an exhibit in the Louwman Collection (the former ''Nationaal Automobiel Museum'') at [[the Hague]] in The Netherlands.\n\nDesigns for four-wheel drive in the U.S., came from the Twyford Company of [[Brookville, Pennsylvania]] in 1905, six were made there around 1906; one still exists and is displayed annually.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.novak-adapt.com/knowledge/model_18.htm |title=The Novak Guide to the Dana Spicer Model 18 Transfer Case |publisher=Novak Conversions |accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref> The second U.S. four-wheel-drive vehicle was built in 1908 by (what became) the [[Four Wheel Drive]] Auto Company (FWD) of [[Wisconsin]] (not to be confused with the term \"FWD\" as an acronym for ''front-wheel drive'').

The [[Marmon-Herrington|Marmon-Herrington Company]] was founded in 1931 to serve a growing market for moderately priced four-wheel-drive vehicles. Marmon-Herrington specialized in converting [[Ford]] trucks to four-wheel drive and got off to a successful start by procuring contracts for military aircraft refueling trucks, 4\u00d74 chassis for towing light weaponry,<ref>{{cite journal |title=27 Trailer Towing Tips |first=Jimmy |last=Nylund |url=http://www.fourwheeler.com/techarticles/129_0607_trailer_towing/viewall.html |journal=Four Wheeler |date=February 2009 |accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref> commercial aircraft refueling trucks, and an order from the Iraqi Pipeline Company for what were the largest trucks ever built at the time.\n\n\n[[Daimler-Benz]] also has a history in four-wheel drive. In 1907 the [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft]] had built a four-wheel-driven vehicle called ''Dernburg-Wagen'', also equipped with [[four-wheel steering]], that was used by German colonial civil servant, Bernhard Dernburg, in [[Namibia]]. Mercedes and BMW, in 1926, introduced a rather sophisticated four-wheel drive, the G1, the G4 and G4 following. The 1937 Mercedes-Benz G5 and BMW 325 4\u00d74 featured full-time four-wheel drive, four-wheel steering, three locking differentials, and fully independent suspension. They were produced because of a government demand for a four-wheel-drive passenger vehicle. The modern G-series/Wolf such as the [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class|G500]] and [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class#Models|G55]] [[Mercedes-AMG|AMG]] still feature some of the attributes, with the exception of fully independent suspension since it hinders suspension articulation. The [[Unimog]] is another Mercedes truck.\n\n===1930s\u20131944===\nPossibly the first four-wheel-drive vehicle produced for civilian use was the [[GAZ-61]], developed in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in 1938. \"Civilian use\" may be a bit of a misnomer, as most if not all were used by the Soviet government and military (as command cars), but the GAZ-61-73 version is the first four-wheel drive vehicle with a normal closed [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]] body. Elements of the chassis were used in military vehicles such as the [[GAZ-64]], [[GAZ-67]], [[GAZ-69]], and also the properly civilian [[GAZ-M-72]] (based on the [[rear-wheel drive]] [[GAZ-20]] \"Victory\" and built from 1955-1958). Soviet civilian life did not allow the proliferation of civilian products such as the [[Jeep]] in the [[United States]], but through the 1960s the technology of Soviet 4\u00d74 vehicles stayed on par with British, German, and American models, even exceeding it in some aspects, and for military purposes just as actively developed, produced and used.\n\nIt was not until \"go-anywhere\" vehicles were needed for the military that four-wheel drive found its place.

The new Eagles combined Jeep technology with an existing and proven AMC passenger [[automobile platform]]. They ushered a whole new product category of \"sport-utility\" or [[crossover SUV]]. AMC's Eagles came with the comfort and high-level appointments expected of regular passenger models and used the off-road technology for an extra margin of safety and traction.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/automobiles/collectibles/09EAGLE.html?_r=0 |last=Sass |first=Rob |title=A Breed of 4-by-4 Hatched on the Fly |newspaper=The New York Times |date=9 March 2008 |accessdate=21 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe Eagle's thick [[viscous]] fluid center differential provided quiet and smooth transfer of power that was directed proportionally to the axle with the greatest traction. This was a true full-time system operating only in four-wheel drive without undue wear on suspension or driveline components. There was no low range in the transfer case. This became the forerunner of the designs that followed from other manufacturers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Padgett |first=Martin |title=Hummer |publisher=Zenith |year=2004 |page=26 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LRHYzfwxVfEC&pg=PA26&dq=AMC+Eagle+precursor+to+most+popular+vehicle | isbn=978-0-7603-1863-8 |accessdate=21 January 2013 }}</ref> The automobile press at the time tested the traction of the Eagles and described it as far superior to the Subaru's and that it could beat many so-called off-road vehicles.

Two additional models were added in 1981, the sub-compact SX/4 and Kammback. A manual transmission and a front axle-disconnect feature were also made available for greater fuel economy. During 1981 and 1982 a unique [[Convertible (car)|convertible]] was added to the line. The Eagle's [[monocoque]] body was reinforced for the conversion and had a steel [[targa top|targa bar]] with a removable fiberglass roof section.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of the American Auto |year=2005 |publisher=Publications International |isbn=978-0-7853-9874-5 |editor=Consumer's Guide |page=532}}</ref> The Eagle station wagon remained in production for one model year after Chrysler acquired AMC in 1987.\n\n[[Audi]] also introduced a permanently all-wheel-driven road-going car, the [[Audi Quattro]], in 1980.  Audi's chassis engineer, Jorg Bensinger, had noticed in winter tests in Scandinavia that a vehicle used by the German Army, the [[Volkswagen]] [[Volkswagen Iltis|Iltis]], could beat any high-performance Audi. He proposed developing a four-wheel-drive car, that would also be used for [[rallying]] to improve Audi's conservative image. The Audi Quattro system became a feature on production cars.\n\nIn 1987, [[Toyota]] also developed a car built for competition in rally campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alltrac.net/FAQ.html#origin |title=Celica All Trac and Gt-Four FAQ |publisher=Alltrac.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-07}}</ref> A limited number of road-going [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[Homologation]] Special Vehicle Celica GT-Four (known as [[Toyota Celica]] All-Trac Turbo in the US) were produced. The [[All-Trac]] system was later available on serial production [[Toyota Camry]], [[Toyota Corolla]], and [[Toyota Previa]] models.\n\nSome of the earliest [[mid-engined]] four-wheel-drive cars were the various road-legal rally cars made for [[Group B]] homologation, such as the [[Ford RS200]] made from 1984 to 1986. In 1989, niche maker [[Panther Westwinds]] created a [[mid-engined]] four-wheel-drive, the [[Panther Solo|Panther Solo 2]].\n\n===2000-Present===\nIn 2008, Nissan introduced the [[Nissan GT-R|GT-R]] featuring a rear mounted [[transaxle]]. The AWD system requires two [[drive shaft]]s, one main shaft from the engine to the transaxle and differential and a second drive shaft from the transaxle to the front wheels.<ref>{{cite web|last=Loh|first=Edward|title=First Look: 2008 Nissan GT-R|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupes/112_0712_2008_nissan_gt_r/chassis_transmission.html |date=December 2007 |accessdate=5 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Ferrari FF]] introduced in 2011 features a unique system called '''4RM''', which does away with the heavy center differential and instead attaches a smaller, second transaxle that draws power from the front of the engine. This allows the car to keep the traditional rear transaxle design without the need for a second drive-shaft for the front wheels. However, after fourth gear the awd system shuts off or disables itself.\n\nToday, sophisticated all-wheel-drive systems are found in many passenger vehicles and some exotic [[sports car]]s and [[supercar]]s. Mainstream luxury and near-luxury vehicles which can absorb the extra cost involved, and for which the fuel economy penalty of some 5% is not an issue, are offered with AWD (or \"4\u00d74\" or \"4WD\") as a safety enhancement to meet owners' expectations for a full complement of up-to-date technology.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.freep.com/article/20110428/COL14/104280377/Mark-Phelan-AWD-helps-sell-luxury-Ford-GM-use-systems-build-top-brands |title=AWD helps sell luxury; Ford, GM use systems to build top brands |first=Mark |last=Phelan |newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=27 April 2011 |accessdate=6 May 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Road racing===\n[[Spyker]] is credited with building and racing the first ever four-wheel racing car, the ''Spyker 60 HP'' in 1903.<ref name=\"Henry, A. 1975\"/><ref name=\"1903 Spyker 60 HP\"/>\n\n[[Bugatti]] created a total of three four-wheel-drive racers, the [[Bugatti Type 53|Type 53]], in 1932, but the cars were notorious for having poor [[Automobile handling|handling]].\n\nMiller produced the first 4WD car to qualify for the Indianapolis 500, the 1938 [[Miller Gulf Special]].\n\n[[Ferguson Research Ltd.]] built the front-engine P99 [[Formula One]] car that actually won a non-World Championship race with [[Stirling Moss]] in 1961.  In 1968, [[Team Lotus]] raced cars in the [[Indy 500]] and three years later in Formula 1 with the [[Lotus 56]], that had both turbine engines and 4WD, as well as the 1969 4WD-Lotus 63 that had the standard 3-litre V8 [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[Cosworth]] engine. [[Equipe Matra Sports|Matra]] also raced a similar MS84, and [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]] entered their [[McLaren M9A|M9A]] in the [[1969 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]], while engine manufacturers Ford-Cosworth produced their own version which was tested but never raced.  All these F1 cars were considered inferior to their RWD counterparts, as the advent of aerodynamic downforce meant that adequate traction could be obtained in a lighter and more mechanically efficient manner, and the idea was discontinued, even though Lotus tried repeatedly.\n\n[[Nissan]] and [[Audi]] had success with all-wheel drive in road racing with the former's advent of the [[Nissan Skyline GT-R]] in 1989. So successful was the car that it dominated the Japanese circuit for the first years of production, going on to bigger and more impressive wins in Australia before weight penalties eventually levied a de facto ban on the car. Most controversially was the win pulled off at the 1990 [[Macau Grand Prix]] where the car led from start to finish. [[Audi]]'s dominance in the [[Trans-Am Series]] in 1988 was equally controversial as it led to a weight penalty mid season and to a rule revision banning all-AWD cars, its dominance in [[Super Touring]] eventually led to a [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] ban on AWD system in 1998.\n\nNew {{24hLM|2011}} [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] regulations may revive AWD/4WD in road racing, though such systems are only allowed in new [[Hybrid vehicle drivetrain|hybrid-powered]] [[Le Mans Prototype]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.lemans.org/en/news/2011-LE-MANS-24-HOURS-REGULATIONS_628.html |title=The 2011 Le Mans 24 Hours Regulations |publisher=lemans.org |date=6 October 2010 |accessdate=21 January 2013 }}</ref> One example is the [[Audi R18#R18 e-tron quattro|Audi R18 e-tron quattro]] (winner of {{24hLM|2012}} race, the first ever hybrid/4WD to win Le Mans), utilizing an electric motor in the front axle while combining the engine motor in the rear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/06/17/hybrid-tech-dominates-the-24-hours-of-le-mans-endurance-race |title=\tHybrid Tech Dominates The 24 Hours Of Le Mans Endurance Race [VIDEO]|publisher=Autoblog.com}}</ref>\n\n===In heavy trucks===\n[[Truck classification#Medium duty|Medium-duty trucks]] and [[Truck classification#Heavy duty|Heavy-duty trucks]] have recently adopted 4\u00d74 drive-trains. 4\u00d74 medium-duty trucks became common after [[Ford Motor Company]] began selling [[Ford Super Duty]] trucks. The Super Duty trucks shared many parts between the light duty and medium duty, reducing production costs. The [[Dana 60]] front axle is used on both medium- and light-duty Super Duty trucks. Furthermore, the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]] share/shared parts between the companies reducing costs. The [[Dana S 110]] is currently being used for the rear drive, under Ford and Ram's medium-duty trucks. The Dana 110 was also used on the [[General Motors]] 4\u00d74s as well. [[Ram Trucks]] began selling medium-duty trucks, 4\u00d74 and 4\u00d72, in 2008. General Motors sold a [[Chevrolet Kodiak|4\u00d74]] for model years 2005-2009.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:C4500 GM 4x4 Medium duty trucks.jpg|GM 4\u00d74 medium-duty trucks\nFile:4x4HD International Workstar.jpg|Heavy duty International Workstar \nFile:Ford SD medium duty 4x4 drive train.jpg|Ford medium-duty 4\u00d74 drive train\n</gallery>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===In construction equipment===\n[[File:ExcavatorLoader3654.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Case CE|Case]] [[backhoe loader]] with 4WD]]\nVolvo introduced the Model 646 four-wheel drive [[backhoe loader]] in 1977.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.volvoce.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/VCE/History/04__backhoe%20excavator%20loaders/03%20Volvo%20BM/VBM%20GM%20646/VBM%20646%20D42%20211%201262-7704.pdf |title =Volvo BM 646 Backhoe/Loader |publisher =Volvo AB }}</ref> [[Case CE|Case Corporation]] followed suit in the U.S. in 1987.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Terminology==\nIn engineering terms, \"four-wheel drive\" designates a vehicle with power delivered to four wheel ends spread over at least two axles.  The term ''4\u00d74'' (pronounced ''four by four'') was in use to describe North American military four-wheel-drive vehicles as early as the 1940s,<ref>{{cite web|title=Instruction Book: Driving, Maintenance, Repair.  Department of National Defence, Canada |year=1940 |url= http://bcoy1cpb.pacdat.net/Manual_-_1940_April_DND_pattern_Ford-Chev.jpg |publisher=bcoy1cpb.pacdat.net |accessdate=21 January 2013 }}</ref> with the first number indicating the number of wheel ends on a vehicle and the second indicating the number of driven wheels.\n\nTrucks with dual tires on the rear axle and two driven axles are designated as 4\u00d74s despite having six wheels because the paired rear wheels behave as a single wheel for traction and classification purposes.  True '''[[Six-wheel drive|6\u00d76]]''' vehicles which have three powered axles, and are classified as 6\u00d76s regardless of how many wheels they have.  Examples of these with two rear, one front axle are the 6-wheeled [[Pinzgauer High Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle|Pinzgauer]], which is popular with defense forces around the globe, and 10-wheeled [[GMC CCKW]] made famous by the [[U.S. Army]] in World War II.\n\n''[[4-wheeler]]'' (or ''four-wheeler'') is a related term applying to [[all-terrain vehicle]]s, and not to be confused with four-wheel drive. The \"four\" in the instance referring to the vehicle having four wheels, not necessarily all driven.\n\n==Unusual systems==\nPrompted by a perceived need for a simple, inexpensive all-terrain vehicle for oil exploration in North Africa, the French motor manufacturer [[Citro\u00ebn]] developed the [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV|2CV]] Sahara in 1958. Unlike other 4\u00d74 vehicles which use a conventional [[transfer case]] to drive the front and rear axle, the Sahara had two engines, each independently driving a separate axle, with the rear engine facing backwards.  The two throttles, clutches and gear change mechanisms could be linked, so the two {{convert|12|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|425|cc|CID|0|abbr=on}} engines could run together, or they could be split and the car driven solely by either engine. Combined with twin fuel tanks and twin batteries (which could be set up to run either or both engines), the redundancy of two separate drive trains meant that they could make it back to civilization even after major mechanical failures. Only around 700 of these cars were built, and only 27 are known to exist today.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/frame.php?file=car.php&carnum=1870 |title=Citro\u00ebn 2CV Sahara |first= Wouter |last=Melissen |publisher=Ultimatecarpage.com |date=1 December 2004 |accessdate=21 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\n[[British Motor Corporation|BMC]] experimented with a twin-engine [[Mini Moke]] (dubbed the \"Twini Moke\") in the mid-1960s, but never put it into production. This made advantage of the [[Austin Mini|Mini's]] 'power pack' layout, with a transverse engine and the [[gearbox]] in the engine [[sump]]. Simply by fitting a second engine/gearbox unit across the rear, a rudimentary 4\u00d74 system could be produced. Early prototypes had separate gear levers and clutch systems for each engine. Later versions sent for evaluation by the [[British Army]] had more user-friendly linked systems.\n\nIn 1965, [[A. J. M. Chadwick]] patented a 4WD system, GB 1113068, that used hemispherical wheels for an all-terrain vehicle. Twenty years later, [[B. T. E. Warne]], patented, GB 2172558, an improvement on Chadwick's design that did not use differential gear assemblies. By using near-spherical wheels with provision to tilt and turn each wheel co-ordinatively, the driven wheels maintain constant traction. Furthermore, all driven wheels steer and, as pairing of wheels is not necessary, vehicles with an odd number of wheels are possible without affecting the system's integrity. Progressive deceleration is made possible by dynamically changing the front-to-rear effective wheel diameter ratios.\n\n[[Suzuki Motors]] introduced the [[Suzuki Escudo]] Pikes Peak Edition in 1996. Earlier Suzuki versions were twin engined, from 1996 on the engine is a twin-turbocharged 2.0&nbsp;L V6, mated to a sequential 6-speed manual transmission.\n\n[[Nissan Motors]] has developed a system called [[Nissan E-4WD|E-4WD]]. It is designed for cars that are normally front-wheel drive, however the rear wheels are powered by electric motors. This system was introduced in some variants of the [[Nissan Cube]] and [[Nissan Tiida|Tiida]].  (This is similar to the system used on the [[Ford Escape]] Hybrid AWD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/ford/escapehybrid/2009/review.html |title=2009 Ford Escape Hybrid Review and Specs |publisher=Edmunds.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301035827/http://www.edmunds.com/ford/escapehybrid/2009/review.html |archivedate=1 March 2009 }}</ref>)\n\nChrysler's [[Jeep]] Division debuted the twin engine, {{convert|670|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Jeep Hurricane]] concept at the 2005 [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]].  This vehicle has a unique \"crab crawl\" capability, which allows it to rotate 360\u00b0 in place. This is accomplished by driving the left wheels as a pair and right wheels as a pair, as opposed to driving the front and rear pairs. A central gearbox allows one side to drive in the opposite direction to the other. It also has dual [[Chrysler Hemi engine|Hemi]] V8s.\n\nSome [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid vehicles]] such as the [[Lexus]] [[Lexus RX400h|RX400h]] provide power to an AWD system through a pair of electric motors, one to the front wheels and one to the rear. In the case of the AWD model version of the Lexus RX400h (and its Toyota-branded counterpart, the [[Toyota Harrier|Harrier]] hybrid), the front wheels can also receive drive power directly from the vehicle's gasoline engine as well as via the electric motors, whereas the rear wheels derive power only from the second electric motor. Transfer of power is managed automatically by internal electronics based on traction conditions and need, making this an all-wheel-drive system.\n\nThe '''4RM''' system used in the [[Ferrari FF]] is unique in that it uses two gearboxes, in addition to the traditional Ferrari rear transaxle behind the engine, the system also uses a smaller transaxle drawing power from the front of the engine, sending it to the front wheels as needed. To save space and weight the front transaxle only has three forward speeds (and no reverse). Drive to the front wheels is transmitted through two infinitely-variable clutch packs which are allowed to 'slip' to give the required road wheel speeds.  The system usually operates in the rear-drive only mode and only engages the clutches for the front transaxle when the rear wheels start losing grip.\n\n==Introduction to off-roaders==\n{|

Some in this category have varying degrees of control in the torque distribution between front and rear by allowing some of the clutches in a multi-plate clutch coupling to engage and slip varying amounts. An example of a system like this is the BorgWarner [[i-Trac]](TM) system.\nNote: the [[Haldex Traction]]-based car list was created from the list on Haldex Traction corporate web site: [https://web.archive.org/web/20061111112310/http://www.haldex-traction.com/awdclub/carmodels.htm Haldex Cars]. A version of the [[BorgWarner]] ITM3e system is used on 2006 and up Porsche 911TT's.  The Borg-Warner ITM 3e is also used in the 2006-now [[Hyundai Santa Fe]] and the [[Hyundai Tucson]]. In the Hyundais, the ITM 3e acts like a full-time AWD with 95:5 normal torque split. In extreme conditions, the system can be locked in a 50:50 split via the 4WD LOCK button.\n\n===Multiple gearbox===\n* [[Ferrari FF]] (4RM) rear transaxle with secondary front transaxle connected directly to the engine.\n\nIn Ferrari's 4RM (so far the only system of this type), the engine is set between the traditional Ferrari rear transaxle and a secondary front transaxle (PTU - \"power take off unit\"). The car itself operates primarily as a rear wheel drive vehicle, clutches in the front transaxle only engage when the rear wheels begin to slip. The front transaxle itself only has 3 gears equivalent to 2nd, 4th and reverse in the rear transaxle (with gear ratios 6% taller than the corresponding ratios in the main gearbox), so the system is only active in 1st to 4th gears. The connection between this gearbox and each front wheel is via independent haldex-type clutches, without a differential. Due to the difference in ratios \"the clutches continually slip\" and only transmit, at most, 20% of the engine's torque.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topgear.com/uk/car-news/ferrari-ff-2011-01-25 |first=Paul |last=Horrell |title=Ferrari FF The inside scoop on Ferrari's new FF |publisher=Topgear.com |date=25 January 2011 |accessdate=6 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Part-time===\nThese are vehicles that have no center differential.  Since there is no center differential to allow for speed differences between the front and rear wheels when turning, a small amount of tire slippage must occur during turns. When used on slick surfaces, this is not a problem, but when turning on dry pavement, the tires grip, then are forced to slip, then grip again, and so on, until the turn is completed. This causes the vehicle to exhibit a 'hopping' sensation. Using an engaged part-time 4WD system on a hard surface is not recommended, as damage to the drive-line eventually occurs.\n\n* [[Chevrolet]] ''Rounded-Line'' [[Chevrolet C/K#Third generation 1973\u20131987|K Fleetside]], [[Chevrolet C/K#Third generation 1973\u20131987|K Stepside]], [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer#1973\u20131991|K Blazer]], and [[Chevrolet Suburban#Eighth generation (1973\u20131991)|K Suburban]] - conventional four-wheel drive (1973-1987) or shift-on-the-move four-wheel drive (1981-1987) two-speed [[New Process]] 205 or 208 transfer case. 0:100 [[torque]] split in Two High. 50:50 torque split lock in Four High and Four Low.
