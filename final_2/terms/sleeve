Eng. ''slieve'', or ''slyf'']], a word allied to ''[[wikt:slip#Verb|slip]]'', cf. [[Dutch language#Sleeve|Dutch ''sloof'']]) is the part of a [[garment]] that covers the [[arm]], or through which the arm passes or slips. The pattern of the sleeve is one of the characteristics of fashion in dress, varying in every country and period. Various survivals of the early forms of sleeve are still found in the different types of academic or other [[robe]]s. Where the long hanging sleeve is worn it has, as still in [[China]] and [[Japan]], been used as a pocket, whence has come the phrase ''to have up one's sleeve'', to have something concealed ready to produce. There are many other proverbial and metaphorical expressions associated with the sleeve, such as ''to wear one's heart upon one's sleeve'', and ''to laugh in one's sleeve''.\n\nSleeve length varies from barely over the shoulder (''cap sleeve'') to floor-length. Most contemporary [[Shirt#Sleeves|shirt sleeves]] end somewhere between the mid-upper arm and the wrist.\n\nEarly medieval sleeves were cut straight, and underarm triangle-shaped gussets were used to provide ease of movement.  In the 14th century, the rounded sleeve cap was invented, allowing a more fitted sleeve to be developed.\n\n==Types of sleeves==\nOften the names applied to sleeves in historical costume are modern.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n!
