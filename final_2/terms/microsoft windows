It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the [[operating system|OS]] typically associated with [[IBM PC compatible]] architecture. Active Windows families include [[Windows NT]], [[Windows Embedded]] and [[Windows Phone]]; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. [[Windows Embedded Compact]] (Windows CE) or [[Windows Server]]. Defunct Windows families include [[Windows 9x]]; [[Windows 10 Mobile]] is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family [[Windows Mobile]].\n\nMicrosoft introduced an [[operating environment]] named ''Windows'' on November 20, 1985, as a graphical [[operating system shell]] for [[MS-DOS]] in response to the growing interest in [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs).<ref name=aboutcomnov>{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/mstartinventions/a/Windows.htm?rd=1 |title=The Unusual History of Microsoft Windows |accessdate=April 22, 2007}}</ref> Microsoft Windows came to [[Dominance (economics)|dominate]] the world's [[personal computer]] (PC) market with [[Usage share of operating systems|over 90% market share]], overtaking [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]], which had been introduced in 1984.  [[Apple Inc|Apple]] came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] and [[Macintosh]] (eventually settled in court in Microsoft's favor in 1993).  On PCs, Windows is still the most popular operating system. However, in 2014, Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to [[Android (operating system)|Android]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2490008/microsoft-windows/microsoft-gets-real--admits-its-device-share-is-just-14-.html|title=Microsoft gets real, admits its device share is just 14%|last=Keizer|first=Gregg|date=July 14, 2014|website=[[Computerworld]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|access-date=|quote=[Microsoft's chief operating officer] Turner's 14% came from a new forecast released last week by Gartner, which estimated Windows' share of the shipped device market last year was 14%, and would decrease slightly to 13.7% in 2014.

As of 2014, the following Windows families are being actively developed:\n\n* [[Windows NT]]:  Started as a family of operating system with [[Windows NT 3.1]], an operating system for [[Server (computing)|server computers]] and [[workstations]]. It now consists of three operating system subfamilies that are released almost at the same time and share the same kernel. It is almost impossible for someone unfamiliar with the subject to identify the members of this family by name because they do not adhere to any specific rule; e.g. [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]], [[Windows 8]]/[[Windows 8.1|8.1]] and [[Windows RT]] are members of this family but [[Windows 3.1]] is not.\n** Windows: The operating system for mainstream [[personal computers]], [[tablet computer|tablet]]s and [[smartphone]]s. The latest version is [[Windows 10]]. The main competitor of this family is [[macOS]] by [[Apple Inc.]] for personal computers and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] for mobile devices (c.f. {{section link|Usage share of operating systems|Market share by category}}).\n** [[Windows Server]]: The operating system for server computers. The latest version is [[Windows Server 2016]]. Unlike its clients sibling, it has adopted a strong naming scheme. The main competitor of this family is [[Linux]]. (c.f. {{section link|Usage share of operating systems|Market share by category}})\n** [[Windows PE]]: A lightweight version of its Windows sibling meant to operate as a [[Live OS|live operating system]], used for installing Windows on bare-metal computers (especially on many computers at once), recovery or troubleshooting purposes. The latest version is Windows PE 10.0.10586.0.\n* [[Windows Embedded]]: Initially, Microsoft developed [[Windows CE]] as a general-purpose operating system for every device that was too resource-limited to be called a full-fledged computer. Eventually, however, Windows CE was renamed Windows Embedded Compact and was folded under Windows Compact trademark which also consists of [[Windows Embedded Industry]], Windows Embedded Professional, [[Windows Embedded Standard]], [[Windows Embedded Handheld]] and [[Windows Embedded Automotive]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.microsoft.com/windowsembedded/en-us/products-solutions-overview.aspx|title = RTOS: Embedded Real Time Operating Systems|date = |accessdate = November 7, 2014|website = microsoft.com|publisher = [[Microsoft]]|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nThe following Windows families are no longer being developed:\n\n* [[Windows 9x]]: An operating system that targeted consumers market. Discontinued because of suboptimal performance. (''[[PC World]]'' called its last version, [[Windows ME]], one of the worst products of all times.)<ref name=\"WinMEbad\" /> Microsoft now caters to the consumers market with Windows NT.\n* [[Windows Mobile]]: The predecessor to Windows Phone, it was a mobile phone operating system. The first version was called [[Pocket PC 2000]]; the third version, [[Windows Mobile 2003]] is the first version to adopt the Windows Mobile trademark. The last version is [[Windows Mobile 6.5]].\n* [[Windows Phone]]: An operating system sold only to manufacturers of smartphones. The first version was [[Windows Phone 7]], followed by [[Windows Phone 8]], and the last version [[Windows Phone 8.1]]. It was succeeded by [[Windows 10 Mobile]].\n\n==Version history==\n{{Main|History of Microsoft Windows}}\n{{See also|List of Microsoft Windows versions}}\n\nThe term ''Windows'' collectively describes any or all of several generations of [[Microsoft]] [[operating system]] products. These products are generally categorized as follows:\n\n===Early versions===\n{{Main|Windows 1.0|Windows 2.0|Windows 2.1x}}\n[[File:Windows1.0.png|thumb|300px|[[Windows 1.0]], the first version, released in 1985]]\n\nThe history of Windows dates back to September 1981, when Chase Bishop, a computer scientist, designed the first model of an electronic device and project Interface Manager was started. It was announced in November 1983 (after the [[Apple Lisa]], but before the [[Macintosh]]) under the name \"Windows\", but [[Windows 1.0]] was not released until November 1985.<ref>[http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/history A history of Windows] (at microsoft.com)</ref> Windows 1.0 was to compete with [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s operating system, but achieved little popularity.  Windows 1.0 is not a complete operating system; rather, it extends [[MS-DOS]]. The shell of Windows 1.0 is a program known as the [[MS-DOS Executive]]. Components included [[Microsoft Calculator|Calculator]], Calendar, [[Cardfile]], [[ClipBook Viewer|Clipboard viewer]], Clock, [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]], [[Notepad (Windows)|Notepad]], [[Microsoft Paint|Paint]], [[Reversi]], [[Terminal emulator|Terminal]] and [[Windows Write|Write]]. Windows 1.0 does not allow overlapping windows. Instead all windows are [[tiling window manager|tiled]]. Only modal dialog boxes may appear over other windows.\n\n[[Windows 2.0]] was released in December 1987, and was more popular than its predecessor. It features several improvements to the user interface and memory management.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Windows 2.03 changed the OS from tiled windows to overlapping windows. The result of this change led to Apple Computer filing a suit against Microsoft alleging infringement on Apple's copyrights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/apple-vs-microsoft.html |title=The Apple vs. Microsoft GUI Lawsuit |year=2006 |accessdate=March 12, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~mjohnsen/Technology/Lawsuits/appvsms.html |title=Apple Computer, Inc. v. MicroSoft Corp., 35 F.3d 1435 (9th Cir. 1994) |accessdate=March 12, 2008}}</ref> Windows 2.0 also introduced more sophisticated [[keyboard shortcut]]s and could make use of [[expanded memory]].\n\nWindows 2.1 was released in two different versions: [[Windows/286]] and [[Windows/386]]. Windows/386 uses the [[virtual 8086 mode]] of the [[Intel 80386]] to multitask several DOS programs and the [[paging|paged memory model]] to emulate expanded memory using available [[extended memory]]. Windows/286, in spite of its name, runs on both [[Intel 8086]] and [[Intel 80286]] processors. It runs in [[real mode]] but can make use of the [[high memory area]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn addition to full Windows-packages, there were runtime-only versions that shipped with early Windows software from third parties and made it possible to run their Windows software on MS-DOS and without the full Windows feature set.\n\nThe early versions of Windows are often thought of as graphical shells, mostly because they ran on top of MS-DOS and use it for [[file system]] services.<ref name=\"Evolution\">{{cite web |url=http://news.soft32.com/windows-evolution_1629.html |title=Windows Evolution |publisher=Soft32.com News}}</ref> However, even the earliest Windows versions already assumed many typical operating system functions; notably, having their own [[executable file format]] and providing their own [[device driver]]s (timer, graphics, printer, mouse, keyboard and sound). Unlike MS-DOS, Windows allowed users to execute multiple graphical applications at the same time, through [[Nonpreemptive multitasking|cooperative multitasking]]. Windows implemented an elaborate, segment-based, software virtual memory scheme, which allows it to run applications larger than available memory: code segments and [[resource (Windows)|resources]] are swapped in and thrown away when memory became scarce; data segments moved in memory when a given application had relinquished processor control.\n\n===Windows 3.x===\n{{Main|Windows 3.0|Windows 3.1x}}\n[[File:Windows 3.0 workspace.png|thumb|250px|left|[[Windows 3.0]], released in 1990]]\n\n[[Windows 3.0]], released in 1990, improved the design, mostly because of [[virtual memory]] and loadable virtual device drivers ([[VxD]]s) that allow Windows to share arbitrary devices between multi-tasked DOS applications.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Windows 3.0 applications can run in [[protected mode]], which gives them access to several megabytes of memory without the obligation to participate in the software virtual memory scheme. They run inside the same address space, where the segmented memory provides a degree of protection. Windows 3.0 also featured improvements to the user interface. Microsoft rewrote critical operations from [[C (programming language)|C]] into [[Assembly language|assembly]]. Windows 3.0 is the first Microsoft Windows version to achieve broad commercial success, selling 2 million copies in the first six months.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/compsoft/soft1991.htm |title=Chronology of Personal Computer Software}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm |title=Microsoft Company}}</ref>\n\nWindows 3.1, made [[general availability release|generally available]] on March 1, 1992, featured a facelift. In August 1993, Windows for Workgroups, a special version with integrated [[peer-to-peer networking]] features and a version number of 3.11, was released. It was sold along Windows 3.1.

While still remaining MS-DOS-based, Windows 95 introduced support for native [[32-bit application]]s, [[plug and play]] hardware, [[preemptive multitasking]], [[long file name]]s of up to 255 characters, and provided increased stability over its predecessors. Windows 95 also introduced a redesigned, [[Object-oriented design|object oriented]] user interface, replacing the previous [[Program Manager]] with the [[Start menu]], [[taskbar]], and [[Windows Explorer]] [[Windows shell|shell]]. Windows 95 was a major commercial success for Microsoft; Ina Fried of [[CNET]] remarked that \"by the time Windows 95 was finally ushered off the market in 2001, it had become a fixture on computer desktops around the world.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Windows 95 turns 15: Has Microsoft's OS peaked?|url= http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/web/08/25/cnet.microsoft.windows/index.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100826141242/http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/web/08/25/cnet.microsoft.windows/index.html|archivedate= August 26, 2010|publisher=CNET/CNN Tech|date=August 25, 2010|accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref> Microsoft published four OEM Service Releases (OSR) of Windows 95, each of which was roughly equivalent to a [[service pack]].

Windows 98 also included integration with [[Internet Explorer 4]] through [[Active Desktop]] and other aspects of the [[Windows Desktop Update]] (a series of enhancements to the Explorer shell which were also made available for Windows 95). In May 1999, Microsoft released [[Windows 98 Second Edition]], an updated version of Windows 98. Windows 98 SE added [[Internet Explorer 5.0]] and [[Windows Media Player]] 6.2 amongst other upgrades.

NT OS/2 was intended to be a secure, [[multi-user]] operating system with [[POSIX]] compatibility and a modular, [[Software portability|portable]] [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]] with [[preemptive multitasking]] and support for multiple processor architectures. However, following the successful release of [[Windows 3.0]], the NT development team decided to rework the project to use an extended [[32-bit]] port of the [[Windows API]] known as Win32 instead of those of OS/2. Win32 maintained a similar structure to the Windows [[API]]s (allowing existing Windows applications to easily be [[Porting|ported]] to the platform), but also supported the capabilities of the existing NT kernel. Following its approval by Microsoft's staff, development continued on what was now Windows NT, the first 32-bit version of Windows. However, IBM objected to the changes, and ultimately continued OS/2 development on its own.<ref name=\"insident\">{{cite book | ref= harv | last= Custer | first= Helen | title= Inside Windows NT | publisher= Microsoft Press | location= Redmond | year= 1993 | ISBN=1-55615-481-X}}</ref><ref name=\"thurrott-nt\"/>\n\nThe first release of the resulting operating system, [[Windows NT 3.1]] (named to associate it with [[Windows 3.1]]) was released in July 1993, with versions for desktop [[workstation]]s and [[server (computing)|servers]]. [[Windows NT 3.5]] was released in September 1994, focusing on performance improvements and support for [[Novell]]'s [[NetWare]], and was followed up by [[Windows NT 3.51]] in May 1995, which included additional improvements and support for the [[PowerPC]] architecture. [[Windows NT 4.0]] was released in June 1996, introducing the redesigned interface of [[Windows 95]] to the NT series. On February 17, 2000, Microsoft released [[Windows 2000]], a successor to NT 4.0.

A number of significant changes were made on Windows 8, including the introduction of a user interface based around Microsoft's [[Metro (design language)|Metro design language]] with optimizations for [[multi-touch|touch-based]] devices such as [[tablet computer|tablets]] and all-in-one PCs. These changes include the [[Start menu#Third version|Start screen]], which uses large tiles that are more convenient for touch interactions and allow for the display of continually updated information, and a new class of [[application software|apps]] which are designed primarily for use on touch-based devices. Other changes include increased integration with [[cloud computing|cloud services]] and other online platforms (such as [[social networking service|social networks]] and Microsoft's own [[OneDrive]] (formerly SkyDrive) and [[Xbox Live]] services), the [[Windows Store]] service for software distribution, and a new variant known as [[Windows RT]] for use on devices that utilize the [[ARM architecture]].<ref name=pcw-testdrivertm>{{cite web|last=Case|first=Loyd|title=Test Driving Windows 8 RTM|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/260884/test_driving_windows_8_rtm.html|work=PC World|publisher=IDG|accessdate= September 9, 2012}}</ref><ref name=bi-windows8>{{cite web|last=Rosoff|first=Matt|title=Here's Everything You Wanted To Know About Microsoft's Upcoming iPad Killers|url=http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-02-09/tech/31040510_1_steven-sinofsky-pcs-microsoft-first|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate= February 10, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"bw-win8editions\">{{cite web|url=http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2012/04/16/announcing-the-windows-8-editions.aspx |title=Announcing the Windows 8 Editions |publisher=Microsoft|date=April 16, 2012 |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name=bw8-buildingarm>{{cite web|title=Building Windows for the ARM processor architecture|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/02/09/building-windows-for-the-arm-processor-architecture.aspx|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=November 21, 2012}}</ref><ref name=verge-talkswin8>{{cite web|title=Microsoft talks Windows Store features, Metro app sandboxing for Windows 8 developers|url=http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/17/3026590/microsoft-windows-8-developers-windows-store-sandboxing|work=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate= September 8, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"pcw-building\">{{cite news|title=Build: More Details On Building Windows 8 Metro Apps|url=http://forwardthinking.pcmag.com/show-reports/287736-build-more-details-on-building-windows-8-metro-apps|work=PC Magazine|accessdate=February 10, 2012|first=Michael|last=Miller}}</ref> An update to Windows 8, called [[Windows 8.1]],<ref>[http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2013/10/17/windows-8-1-now-available.aspx Windows 8.1 now available!].

[[Windows 8]] and [[Windows 8.1]] has been subject to some criticism, such as removal of Start Menu.\n\n====Windows 10====\n{{Main|Windows 10}}\nOn September 30, 2014, Microsoft announced [[Windows 10]] as the successor to Windows 8.1. It was released on July 29, 2015, and addresses shortcomings in the user interface first introduced with Windows 8. Changes include the return of the Start Menu, a [[virtual desktop]] system, and the ability to run Windows Store apps within windows on the desktop rather than in full-screen mode. [[Windows 10]] is said to be available to update from qualified [[Windows 7]] with SP1 and [[Windows 8.1]] computers from the Get Windows 10 Application (for [[Windows 7]], [[Windows 8.1]]) or [[Windows Update]] ([[Windows 7]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2014/09/30/announcing-windows-10/|title = Announcing Windows 10 - Windows Blog|date = September 30, 2014|accessdate = September 30, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nOn November 12, 2015, an update to Windows 10, version 1511, was released.<ref name=\"Redmondpie: Windows 10 v1511 released\">{{cite web |url=http://www.redmondpie.com/windows-10-1511-build-10586-november-update-is-out-heres-how-to-update-now/ |title=Windows 10 1511 Build 10586 November Update Is Out, Here\u2019s How To Update Now |author=Paul Morris |publisher=Redmond Pie |date=November 13, 2015 |accessdate=January 1, 2016}}</ref>\nThis update can be activated with a Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 product key as well as Windows 10 product keys.<ref name=\"What\u2019s New in Windows 10s First Big Update (Which Arrives Today)\">{{cite web | url=http://www.howtogeek.com/232176/whats-new-in-windows-10s-first-big-update-the-windows-10-fall-update/ | title=What\u2019s New in Windows 10s First Big Update (Which Arrives Today) | publisher=How-To Geek | date=November 12, 2015 | accessdate=January 1, 2016}}</ref> Features include new icons and right-click context menus, default printer management, four times as many tiles allowed in the Start menu, Find My Device, and Edge updates.<ref name=\"What\u2019s New in Windows 10s First Big Update (Which Arrives Today)\" />\n\n====Multilingual support====\nMultilingual support is built into Windows. The language for both the keyboard and the interface can be changed through the Region and Language Control Panel. Components for all supported input languages, such as [[Input Method Editor]]s, are automatically installed during Windows installation (in Windows XP and earlier, files for East Asian languages, such as Chinese, and right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic, may need to be installed separately, also from the said Control Panel). Third-party IMEs may also be installed if a user feels that the provided one is insufficient for their needs.\n\nInterface languages for the operating system are free for download, but some languages are limited to certain editions of Windows. [[Language Interface Pack]]s (LIPs) are redistributable and may be downloaded from Microsoft's Download Center and installed for any edition of Windows (XP or later){{snd}} they translate most, but not all, of the Windows interface, and require a certain base language (the language which Windows originally shipped with). This is used for most languages in emerging markets. Full Language Packs, which translates the complete operating system, are only available for specific editions of Windows (Ultimate and Enterprise editions of Windows Vista and 7, and all editions of Windows 8, 8.1 and RT except Single Language). They do not require a specific base language, and are commonly used for more popular languages such as French or Chinese. These languages cannot be downloaded through the Download Center, but available as optional updates through the [[Windows Update]] service (except Windows 8).\n\nThe interface language of installed applications are not affected by changes in the Windows interface language. Availability of languages depends on the application developers themselves.\n\n[[Windows 8]] and [[Windows Server 2012]] introduces a new Language Control Panel where both the interface and input languages can be simultaneously changed, and language packs, regardless of type, can be downloaded from a central location. The PC Settings app in [[Windows 8.1]] and [[Windows Server 2012 R2]] also includes a counterpart settings page for this. Changing the interface language also changes the language of preinstalled [[Windows Store]] apps (such as Mail, Maps and News) and certain other Microsoft-developed apps (such as Remote Desktop). The above limitations for language packs are however still in effect, except that full language packs can be installed for any edition except Single Language, which caters to emerging markets.\n\n====Platform support====\nWindows NT included support for several different platforms before the [[x86]]-based [[personal computer]] became dominant in the professional world. [[Windows NT 4.0]] and its predecessors supported [[PowerPC]], [[DEC Alpha]] and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] R4000. (Although some these platforms implement [[64-bit computing]], the operating system treated them as 32-bit.) However, Windows 2000, the successor of Windows NT 4.0, dropped support for all platforms except the third generation x86 (known as [[IA-32]]) or newer in 32-bit mode. The client line of Window NT family still runs on IA-32, although the [[Windows Server]] line has ceased supporting this platform with the release of [[Windows Server 2008 R2]].\n\nWith the introduction of the Intel Itanium architecture ([[IA-64]]), Microsoft released new versions of Windows to support it. Itanium versions of [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] were released at the same time as their mainstream x86 counterparts. Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, released in 2005, is the last Windows client operating systems to support Itanium. Windows Server line continues to support this platform until [[Windows Server 2012]]; Windows Server 2008 R2 is the last Windows operating system to support Itanium architecture.\n\nOn April 25, 2005, Microsoft released [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition]] and Windows Server 2003 x64 Editions to support the [[x86-64]] (or simply x64), the eighth generation of x86 architecture. [[Windows Vista]] was the first client version of Windows NT to be released simultaneously in IA-32 and x64 editions. x64 is still supported.\n\nAn edition of Windows 8 known as [[Windows RT]] was specifically created for computers with [[ARM architecture]] and while ARM is still used for Windows smartphones with Windows 10, tablets with Windows RT will not be updated.\n\n===Windows CE===\n{{Main|Windows CE|Windows Phone}}\n[[File:WindowsCE7.png|thumb|250px|The latest current version of Windows CE, [[Windows Embedded Compact 7]], displaying a concept media player UI]]\n\nWindows CE (officially known as ''Windows Embedded Compact''), is an edition of Windows that runs on [[Handheld PC|minimalistic computers]], like satellite navigation systems and some mobile phones. Windows Embedded Compact is based on its own dedicated kernel, dubbed Windows CE kernel. Microsoft licenses Windows CE to [[OEM]]s and device makers. The OEMs and device makers can modify and create their own user interfaces and experiences, while Windows CE provides the technical foundation to do so.\n\nWindows CE was used in the [[Dreamcast]] along with Sega's own proprietary OS for the console. Windows CE was the core from which [[Windows Mobile]] was derived. Its successor, [[Windows Phone 7]], was based on components from both [[Windows Embedded CE 6.0|Windows CE 6.0 R3]] and [[Windows Embedded Compact 7|Windows CE 7.0]]. [[Windows Phone 8]] however, is based on the same NT-kernel as Windows 8.\n\nWindows Embedded Compact is not to be confused with [[Windows XP Embedded]] or [[Windows NT 4.0 Embedded]], modular editions of Windows based on Windows NT kernel.\n\n===Xbox OS===\n{{Main|Xbox One system software|Xbox 360 system software}}\nXbox OS is an unofficial name given to the version of Windows that runs on the [[Xbox One]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/7528/the-xbox-one-mini-review-hardware-analysis|title=The Xbox One - Mini Review & Comparison to Xbox 360/PS4|author=Anand Lal Shimpi|work=anandtech.com}}</ref> It is a more specific implementation with an emphasis on virtualization (using [[Hyper-V]]) as it is three operating systems running at once, consisting of the core operating system, a second implemented for games and a more Windows-like environment for applications.<ref name=\"xboxonethreesystems\">{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/156467-xbox-one-hardware-and-software-specs-detailed-and-analyzed|title=Xbox One: Hardware and software specs detailed and analyzed - Three operating systems in one|publisher=ExtremeTech|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}</ref>\nMicrosoft updates Xbox One's OS every month, and these updates can be downloaded from the Xbox Live service to the Xbox and subsequently installed, or by using offline recovery images downloaded via a PC.<ref>{{cite web|website=Xbox Official Site|url=http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/system/offline-system-update-diagnostic-tool|title=How to use the Offline System Update Diagnostic Tool on Xbox One|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=November 30, 2013}}</ref> The Windows 10-based Core had replaced the Windows 8-based one in this update, and the new system is sometimes referred to as \"Windows 10 on Xbox One\" or \"OneCore\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-one-is-literally-a-windows-device/1100-6430425/|title=Xbox One Is \"Literally a Windows Device\"|work=GameSpot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-one-update-will-make-some-functionality-5/1100-6430524/|title=New Xbox One Update Will Make Some Functionality 50 Percent Faster|work=GameSpot}}</ref> \nXbox One's system also allows backward compatibility with Xbox 360,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/15/8786501/microsoft-xbox-one-dashboard-update-features|title=Xbox One dashboard update includes a huge new design and Cortana|author=Tom Warren|date=June 16, 2015|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge}}</ref> and the Xbox 360's system is backwards compatible with the original Xbox.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xbox.about.com/od/xbox360faqs/f/x360bcfaq.htm|title=Xbox 360 and Xbox Games Backwards Compatibility|author=Eric Qualls|work=About.com Tech}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline of releases==\n{{hidden begin\n|title      = Table of Windows versions\n|titlestyle = background:#D3D3D3\n}}\n{{Version |l |show=111111}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Product name\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Latest version\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[General availability]] date\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Codename\n! colspan=\"2\" | Support until<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/|title=Microsoft Support Lifecycle|publisher=Microsoft}}</ref>\n! colspan=\"3\" | Latest version of\n|-\n!

The below 50% usage share of Windows, also applies to developed countries, such as the US, the UK and Ireland. These numbers are easiest (monthly numbers) to find that track real use, but they may not mirror installed base or sales numbers (in recent years) of devices.\n\nIn terms of the number of devices shipped with the operating system installed, on smartphones, Windows Phone was the third-most-shipped OS (2.6%) after Android (82.8%) and iOS (13.9%) in the second quarter of 2015 according [[International Data Corporation|IDC]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.idc.com/prodserv/smartphone-os-market-share.jsp|title=IDC: Smartphone OS Market Share|website=www.idc.com|access-date=2016-07-13}}</ref> Across both PCs and mobile devices, in 2014, Windows OSes were the second-most-shipped (333 million devices, or 14%) after Android (1.2 billion, 49%) and ahead of iOS and macOS combined (263 million, 11%).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2954317|title=Gartner Says Tablet Sales Continue to Be Slow in 2015|access-date=2016-07-13}}</ref>\n\n==Security==\nConsumer versions of Windows were originally designed for ease-of-use on a single-user PC without a network connection, and did not have security features built in from the outset.<ref>Multi-user memory protection was not introduced until Windows NT and XP, and a computer's default user was an administrator until Windows Vista.

In addition, they implemented only partial [[memory protection]]. They were accordingly widely criticised for lack of security.\n\nThe [[Windows NT]] series of operating systems, by contrast, are true multi-user, and implement absolute memory protection. However, a lot of the advantages of being a true multi-user operating system were nullified by the fact that, prior to Windows Vista, the first user account created during the setup process was an [[Windows administrator|administrator]] account, which was also the default for new accounts. Though [[Windows XP]] did have limited accounts, the majority of home users did not change to an account type with fewer rights&nbsp;\u2013 partially due to the number of programs which unnecessarily required administrator rights&nbsp;\u2013 and so most home users ran as administrator all the time.\n\n[[Windows Vista]] changes this<ref>Microsoft describes in detail the steps taken to combat this in a TechNet bulletin. Source: [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsvista/aa905073.aspx Windows Vista Security and Data Protection Improvements].</ref> by introducing a privilege elevation system called [[User Account Control]]. When logging in as a standard user, a logon session is created and a [[Token (Windows NT architecture)|token]] containing only the most basic privileges is assigned. In this way, the new logon session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system. When logging in as a user in the Administrators group, two separate tokens are assigned. The first token contains all privileges typically awarded to an administrator, and the second is a restricted token similar to what a standard user would receive. User applications, including the [[Windows shell]], are then started with the restricted token, resulting in a reduced privilege environment even under an Administrator account. When an application requests higher privileges or \"Run as administrator\" is clicked, UAC will prompt for confirmation and, if consent is given (including administrator credentials if the account requesting the elevation is not a member of the administrators group), start the process using the unrestricted token.<ref name=\"kennykerr\">{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/09/29/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-4-_1320_-User-Account-Control.aspx |title=Windows Vista for Developers&nbsp;\u2013 Part 4&nbsp;\u2013 User Account Control |author=Kenny Kerr |date=September 29, 2006 |accessdate=March 15, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===File permissions===\nAll Windows versions from Windows NT 3 have been based on a file system permission system referred to as AGLP (Accounts, Global, Local, Permissions) [[AGDLP]] which in essence where file permissions are applied to the file/folder in the form of a 'local group' which then has other 'global groups' as members. These global groups then hold other groups or users depending on different Windows versions used. This system varies from other vendor products such as [[Linux]] and [[NetWare]] due to the 'static' allocation of permission being applied directory to the file or folder. However using this process of AGLP/AGDLP/AGUDLP allows a small number of static permissions to be applied and allows for easy changes to the account groups without reapplying the file permissions on the files and folders.\n\n===Windows Defender===\nOn January 6, 2005, Microsoft released a [[Beta version]] of Microsoft AntiSpyware, based upon the previously released [[GIANT Company Software|Giant]] AntiSpyware. On February 14, 2006, Microsoft AntiSpyware became [[Windows Defender]] with the release of Beta 2. Windows Defender is a freeware program designed to protect against spyware and other unwanted software.
