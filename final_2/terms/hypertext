Apart from text, hyper<wbr>text is sometimes used to describe tables, images and other presentational [[content form]]s with hyperlinks. Hyper<wbr>text is the underlying concept defining the structure of the [[World Wide Web]],<ref>{{cite web| url= http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Internet | title=Internet | type = definition |publisher=Free Online Law Dictionary |date=July 15, 2009 | work = West's Encyclopedia of American Law | edition = 2 |accessdate= November 25, 2008}}</ref> with pages often written in the [[Hypertext Markup Language]] (HTML). It enables an easy-to-use and flexible connection and sharing of information over the [[Internet]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English prefix '''hyper-''' comes from the Greek prefix \"\u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1-\" and means \"over\" or \"beyond\"; it has a common origin with the prefix \"super-\" which comes from Latin. It signifies the overcoming of the previous linear constraints of written text. The term \"hypertext\" is often used where the term \"[[hypermedia]]\" might seem appropriate. In 1992, author [[Ted Nelson]]&nbsp;\u2013 who coined both terms in 1963&nbsp;\u2013 wrote:\n{{Quote | By now the word \"hypertext\" has become generally accepted for branching and responding text, but the corresponding word \"hypermedia\", meaning complexes of branching and responding graphics, movies and sound&nbsp;\u2013 as well as text&nbsp;\u2013 is much less used. Instead they use the strange term \"interactive multimedia\": this is four syllables longer, and does not express the idea of extending hypertext. | Nelson, ''[[Literary Machines]]'', 1992}}\n\n==Types and uses of hypertext==\nHyper<wbr>text documents can either be static (prepared and stored in advance) or dynamic (continually changing in response to user input, such as [[dynamic web page]]s). Static hyper<wbr>text can be used to cross-reference collections of data in documents, [[application software|software applications]], or books on CDs. A well-constructed system can also incorporate other user-interface conventions, such as menus and command lines. [[Hyperlink|Links]] used in a hyper<wbr>text document usually replace the current piece of hyper<wbr>text with the destination document. A less known and used feature is [[StretchText]], which expands or contracts the content in place giving more control to the reader in determining the level of detail of the displayed document. Hyper<wbr>text can develop very complex and dynamic systems of linking and cross-referencing. The most famous implementation of hyper<wbr>text is the [[World Wide Web]], written in the final months of 1990 and released on the [[Internet]] in 1991.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of hypertext|Timeline of hypertext technology}}\nIn 1941, [[Jorge Luis Borges]] published \"[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]\", a [[short story]] that is often considered an inspiration for the concept of hypertext.<ref name=\"inspiration\">{{Citation | url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=317431 | publisher = The Association for Computing Machinery | title = Hyper<wbr>text and creative writing}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1945, [[Vannevar Bush]] wrote an article in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' called \"[[As We May Think]]\", about a futuristic proto-hypertext device he called a [[Memex]].  A Memex would hypothetically store - and record - content on reels of microfilm, using electric photocells to read coded symbols recorded next to individual microfilm frames while the reels spun at high speed, stopping on command. The coded symbols would enable the Memex to index, search, and link content to create and follow associative trails.\n\n[[File:Ted Nelson cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nelson]] gives a presentation on [[Project Xanadu]], a theoretical hyper<wbr>text model conceived in the 1960s whose first and incomplete implementation was first published in 1998<ref name=\"wiredwired\"/>]]\n\nIn 1963, [[Ted Nelson]] coined the terms 'hypertext' and 'hypermedia' in a model he developed for creating and using linked content (first published reference 1965).<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Vassar | url = http://faculty.vassar.edu/mijoyce/Ted_sed.html | last = Joyce | first = MI | title = Did Ted Nelson first use the word \"hypertext\" (sic), meaning fast editing\" at Vassar College?}}</ref> He later worked with [[Andries van Dam]] to develop the [[Hypertext Editing System]] (text editing) in 1967 at [[Brown University]].

In December of that year, Engelbart demonstrated a 'hypertext' (meaning editing) interface to the public for the first time, in what has come to be known as \"[[The Mother of All Demos]]\".\n\nThe first hypermedia application was the [[Aspen Movie Map]] in 1978. This allowed users to choose which way they wanted to drive in a virtual cityscape.\n\nIn 1980, [[Tim Berners-Lee]] created [[ENQUIRE]], an early hyper<wbr>text database system somewhat like a [[wiki]] but without hyper<wbr>text punctuation, which was not invented until 1987.  The early 1980s also saw a number of experimental \"hyperediting\" functions in word processors and [[hypermedia]] programs, many of whose features and terminology were later analogous to the [[World Wide Web]]. [[Guide (hypertext)|Guide]], the first significant hyper<wbr>text system for [[personal computer]]s, was developed by [[Peter J. Brown]] at [[University of Kent|UKC]] in 1982.\n\nIn 1980 [[Roberto Busa]],<ref>{{it}} Andrea Tornielli, ''[http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/documenti/dettaglio-articolo/articolo/web-busa-6893/ Padre Busa, il gesuita che ha inventato l'ipertesto]'', ''[[La Stampa]]'' - VaticanInsider, 11/08/2011</ref> an Italian Jesuit priest and one of the pioneers in the usage of computers for linguistic and literary analysis,<ref>Matthew Zepelin [http://www.academia.edu/8457616/Computers_and_the_Catholic_Mind_Religion_Technology_and_Social_Criticism_in_the_Postwar_United_States Computers and the Catholic Mind: Religion, Technology, and Social Criticism in the Postwar United States]'', July 5, 1914</ref> published the ''Index Thomisticus'', as a tool for performing text searches within the massive corpus of [[Aquinas]]'s works.<ref>[http://corrieredelveneto.corriere.it/veneto/notizie/cronaca/2011/10-agosto-2011/morto-padre-busa-stato-pioniere-informatica-linguistica-1901272086173.shtml ''Morto padre Busa, \u00e8 stato il pioniere dell'informatica linguistica''], ''Corriere del Veneto'', 15.

Hyperties was used to create the July 1988 issue of the [[Communications of the ACM]] as a hyper<wbr>text document and then the first commercial electronic book Hyper<wbr>text Hands-On!\n\nIn August 1987, [[Apple Computer]] released [[HyperCard]] for the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] line at the [[Macworld Conference & Expo|MacWorld convention]]. Its impact, combined with interest in [[Peter J. Brown]]'s [[Guide (hypertext)|GUIDE]] (marketed by [[Office Workstations Ltd|OWL]] and released earlier that year) and Brown University's [[Intermedia (hypertext)|Intermedia]], led to broad interest in and enthusiasm for databases and new media. The first ACM Hyper<wbr>text (hyperediting and databases) [[academic conference]] took place in November 1987, in Chapel Hill NC, where many other applications, including the branched literature writing software [[Storyspace]], were also demonstrated.<ref>Hawisher, Gail E., Paul LeBlanc, Charles Moran, and Cynthia L. Selfe (1996).

The project continued at Autodesk for four years, but no product was released.\n\nIn 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, then a scientist at [[CERN]], proposed and later prototyped a new hyper<wbr>text project in response to a request for a simple, immediate, information-sharing facility, to be used among physicists working at CERN and other academic institutions. He called the project \"WorldWideWeb\".<ref name = \"WWW_proposal\">{{Citation | url = http://www.w3.org/Proposal.html | title = WorldWideWeb: Proposal for a Hyper<wbr>Text Project | publisher = The World Wide Web consortium}}.</ref>\n\n{{quotation | Hyper<wbr>Text is a way to link and access information of various kinds as a web of nodes in which the user can browse at will.

Its ability to provide hyper<wbr>text links within documents that could reach into documents anywhere on the Internet began the creation of the Web on the Internet.\n\nAs new web browsers were released, traffic on the World Wide Web quickly exploded from only 500 known web servers in 1993 to over 10,000 in 1994. As a result, all previous hyper<wbr>text systems were overshadowed by the success of the Web, even though it originally lacked many features of those earlier systems, such as an easy way to edit what you were reading.\n\n==Implementations==\nBesides the already mentioned [[Project Xanadu]], [[Hypertext Editing System]], [[NLS (computer system)|NLS]],  [[HyperCard]], and World Wide Web, there are other noteworthy early implementations of hypertext, with different feature sets:\n[[Image:HypertextEditingSystemConsoleBrownUniv1969.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Hypertext Editing System (HES) [[IBM 2250]] Display console&nbsp;\u2013 Brown University 1969]]\n* [[FRESS]] \u2013 a 1970s multi-user successor to the [[Hypertext Editing System]].\n* [[ZOG (hypertext)|ZOG]] \u2013 a 1970s hyper<wbr>text system developed at [[Carnegie Mellon University]].\n* [[Electronic Document System]] \u2013 an early 1980s text and graphic editor for interactive hypertexts such as equipment repair manuals and computer-aided instruction.\n* [[Information Presentation Facility]] \u2013 used to display online help in [[IBM]] operating systems.\n* [[Intermedia (hypertext)|Intermedia]] \u2013 a mid-1980s program for group web-authoring and information sharing.\n* [[The Interactive Encyclopedia System|HyperTies]] - a mid-1980s program commercially applied to hundreds of projects, including July 1988 [[Communications of the ACM]] and Hyper<wbr>text Hands-On! book.\n* [[Texinfo]] \u2013 the [[GNU]] help system.\n* [[KMS (hypertext)|KMS]] \u2013 a 1980s successor to [[ZOG (hypertext)|ZOG]] developed as a commercial product.\n* [[Storyspace]] \u2013 a mid-1980s program for hyper<wbr>text narrative.\n* Adobe's [[Portable Document Format]] \u2013 a widely used publication format for electronic documents including links.\n* [[Amigaguide]] \u2013 released on the Commodore [[Amiga]] [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] 1990.\n* [[Windows Help]] \u2013 released with Windows 3.0 in 1990.\n* [[Wiki]]s \u2013 aim to compensate for the lack of integrated editors in most Web browsers.

There is a list on the Web with links to all conferences in the series.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.iw3c2.org/conferences/ | contribution = Conferences | title = IW3C2}}.</ref>\n\n==Hypertext fiction==\n{{Main |Hypertext fiction}}\nHyper<wbr>text writing has developed its own style of fiction, coinciding with the growth and proliferation of hyper<wbr>text development software and the emergence of electronic networks. Two software programs specifically designed for literary hypertext, ''Storyspace'' and [[Intermedia (hypertext)|Intermedia]] became available in the 1990s.\n\nOn the other hand, always concerning the Italian production, the hyper<wbr>text s000t000d by Filippo Rosso (2002), was intended to lead the reader (with the help of a three-dimensional map) in a web page interface, and was written in HTML and [[PHP]].\n\nAn advantage of writing a narrative using hyper<wbr>text technology is that the meaning of the story can be conveyed through a sense of spatiality and perspective that is arguably unique to digitally networked environments. An author's creative use of nodes, the self-contained units of meaning in a hypertextual narrative, can play with the reader's orientation and add meaning to the text.\n\nOne of the most successful computer games of all time, [[Myst]], was first written in Hypercard.  The game was constructed as a series of Ages, each Age consisting of a separate Hypercard stack.  The full stack of the game consists of over 2500 cards.  In some ways Myst redefined interactive fiction, using puzzles and exploration as a replacement for hypertextual narrative.<ref>{{cite web| last =Parrish | first = Jeremy|url = http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3134600 |title= When SCUMM Ruled the Earth|publisher= [[1UP.com]] | accessdate = 2008-05-02}}</ref>\n\nCritics of hyper<wbr>text claim that it inhibits the old, linear, reader experience by creating several different tracks to read on, and that this in turn contributes to a [[postmodernist]] fragmentation of worlds. In some cases, hyper<wbr>text may be detrimental to the development of appealing stories (in the case of hyper<wbr>text [[Gamebook]]s), where ease of linking fragments may lead to non-cohesive or incomprehensible narratives.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://biblumliteraria.blogspot.com/2008/07/es-el-hipertexto-una-bendicin-o-un.html | title = \u00bfEs el hipertexto una bendici\u00f3n o un\u2026? | trans_title = Is hyper<wbr>text a blessing or a\u2026? |date=Jul 2008 | publisher = Biblum literaria | language = Spanish}}.</ref> However, they do see value in its ability to present several different views on the same subject in a simple way.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = U Calgary | place = [[Canada|CA]] | url = http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~scriptor/papers/arthur.html | title = The Game of Reading an Electronic Sir Gawain and the Green Knight}}.</ref>  This echoes the arguments of 'medium theorists' like [[Marshall McLuhan]] who look at the social and psychological impacts of the media. New media can become so dominant in public culture that they effectively create a \"paradigm shift\"{{Sfn | Green | 2001 | p = 15}} as people have shifted their perceptions, understanding of the world and ways of interacting with the world and each other in relation to new technologies and media. So hyper<wbr>text signifies a change from linear, structured and hierarchical forms of representing and understanding the world into fractured, decentralized and changeable media based on the technological concept of hyper<wbr>text links.\n\n===Forms of hypertext===\n\nThere are various forms of hypertext, each of which are structured differently. Below are four of the existing forms of hypertext:\n\n'''axial''' hypertexts are the most simple in structure. They are situated along an axis in a linear style. These hypertexts have a straight path from beginning to end and are fairly easy for the reader to follow. An example of an axial hyper<wbr>text is [[The Virtual Disappearance of Miriam]].\n\n'''arborescent''' hypertexts are more complex than the axial form. They have a branching structure which resembles a tree. These hypertexts have one beginning but many possible endings. The ending that the reader finishes on depends on their decisions whilst reading the text. This is much like [[gamebook]] novels that allow readers to choose their own ending.\n\n'''networked''' hypertexts are more complex still than the two previous forms of hypertext. They consist of an interconnected system of nodes with no dominant axis of orientation.\nUnlike the arborescent form, networked hypertexts do not have any designated beginning or any designated endings. An example of a networked hyper<wbr>text is [[Shelley Jackson]]'s [[Patchwork Girl]].\n\n'''layered''' hyper<wbr>text consist of two layers of linked pages. Each layer is doubly linked sequentially and a page in the top layer is doubly linked with a corresponding page in the bottom layer. The top layer contains plain text, the bottom multimedia layer provides photos, sounds and video. In the Dutch historical novel ''{{Interlanguage link multi|De man met de hoed|nl}}''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.demanmetdehoed.nl/presentatie/Welkom.html|title=Welkom|website=demanmetdehoed.nl}}</ref> designed as layered hyper<wbr>text in 2006 by Eisjen Schaaf, Pauline van de Ven en [[Paul Vitanyi|Paul Vit\u00e1nyi]], the structure is proposed to enhance the atmosphere of the time, to enrich the text with research and family archive material and to enable readers to insert memories of their own while preserving tension and storyline.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of hypertext technology|Timeline of hyper<wbr>text technology]]\n* [[Cybertext]]\n* [[Distributed Data Management Architecture]]\n* [[HTML]] (Hyper<wbr>Text Markup Language)\n* [[Hyperwords]]\n* [[Hypotext]]\n* [[Http|HTTP]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist |32em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Citation | title = Technoculture: From Alphabet to Cybersex | first = Lelia | last = Green | publisher = Allen & Unwin Ep | year = 2001 | ISBN = 978-1-86508048-2}}.\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal | last =Engelbart | first = Douglas C | title=Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework | id = AFOSR-3233 Summary Report, SRI Project No. 3579 |year= 1962 | url = http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html}}\n* {{cite conference | last= Nelson | first= Theodor H. | title= Complex information processing: a file structure for the complex, the changing and the indeterminate | booktitle=ACM/CSC-ER Proceedings of the 1965 20th national conference |date=September 1965 | url= http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=806036}}\n* {{cite journal | last=Nelson | first=Theodor H. | title=No More Teachers\u2019 Dirty Looks | journal= Computer Decisions |date=September 1970 | url= http://www.newmediareader.com/excerpts.html}}\n* {{cite conference | last =Nelson | first = Theodor H | author-mask = 3 | title=A Conceptual framework for man-machine everything | booktitle=AFIPS Conference Proceedings | volume = 42 | year=1973 | pages= M22\u201323}}\n* {{cite journal | last1 =Yankelovich | first1 =Nicole | last2 =Landow | first2 = George P | last3 = Cody | first3 = David | title = Creating hypermedia materials for English literature students | journal= SIGCUE Outlook | volume=20 | issue=3 | year=1987}}\n* {{cite book | last= Heim | first=Michael | title=Electric Language: A Philosophical Study of Word Processing | location=New Haven | publisher=Yale University Press | year=1987 | isbn= 0-300-07746-7}}* {{cite journal | last=van Dam | first=Andries | title=Hyper<wbr>text: '87 keynote address | journal = Communications of the ACM |date=July 1988 | volume=31 | pages=887\u201395 | url= http://www.cs.brown.edu/memex/HT_87_Keynote_Address.html | doi=10.1145/48511.48519 | issue=7}}\n* {{Cite journal | title=Hyper<wbr>text: An Introduction and Survey | journal=Computer | volume=20 | issue= 9 | pages = 17\u201341 | last=Conklin | first=J. | year=1987 | doi= 10.1109/MC.1987.1663693}}\n* {{cite journal | last=Byers | first=T.
