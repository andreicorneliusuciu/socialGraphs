A network host may offer information resources, services, and applications to users or other [[node (networking)|nodes]] on the network. A network host is a network node that is assigned a [[network layer]] [[host address]].\n\nComputers participating in networks that use the [[Internet Protocol Suite]] may also be called IP hosts. Specifically, computers participating in the [[Internet]] are called ''Internet hosts'', sometimes Internet nodes. Internet hosts and other IP hosts have one or more [[IP address]]es assigned to their network interfaces. The addresses are configured either manually by an administrator, automatically at start-up by means of the [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] (DHCP), or by [[stateless address autoconfiguration]] methods.\n\nEvery network host is a physical [[network node]] (i.e. a network device), but not every physical network node is a host. Network devices such as [[modem]]s, [[Ethernet hub|hubs]] and [[network switch]]es are not assigned [[host address]]es (except sometimes for administrative purposes), and are consequently not considered to be network hosts. Devices such as network printers and [[hardware router]]s have IP addresses, but since they are not general-purpose computers, they are sometimes not considered to be hosts.\n\nNetwork hosts that participate in applications that use the [[client-server model]] of computing, are classified as [[Server (computing)|server]] or [[client (computing)|client]] systems. Network hosts may also function as nodes in [[peer-to-peer]] applications, in which all nodes share and consume resources in an equipotent manner.\n\n==Server vs. Host==\n\nAll [[Server (computing)|servers]] are hosts, but not all hosts are servers. Any device that has established a connection to a network qualifies as a host, whereas only hosts that accept connections from other devices (clients) qualify as servers.\n\n==Origin of the concept==\n\nIn [[operating systems]], the term [[terminal host]] traditionally denotes a [[multi-user]] computer or software providing services to [[computer terminal]]s, or a computer that provides services to smaller or less capable devices,<ref>E. Garrison Walters, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AwrQsOW5SsQC&pg=PA149&dq=terminal+%22host+%22+a+multi-user&hl=sv&ei=1jwCTfudOcbysgb2xuCLCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=multi-user%20host&f=falseThe essential guide to computing], page 149, Prentice Hall PTR, 2001.</ref> such as a [[mainframe computer]] serving [[teletype]] terminals or [[video terminal]]s. Other examples are a [[telnet]] host (a telnet server) and an [[xhost]] (X Window client).\n\nThe term \"Internet host\" or just \"host\" is used in a number of [[Request for Comments]] (RFC) documents that define the Internet and its predecessor, the [[ARPANET]]. While the ARPANET was developed, computers connected to the network were typically mainframe computer systems that could be accessed from terminals connected via [[serial port]]s. Since these [[dumb terminal]]s did not host software or perform computations themselves, they were not considered hosts. The terminals were connected to the terminal hosts through serial interfaces and perhaps circuit switched networks, but not connected to any IP based network, and were not assigned IP addresses. Today's IP hosts may, however, lack the ability to serve as terminal hosts.\n\nRFC 871 defines a host as a general-purpose computer system connected to a communications network for \"... the purpose of achieving resource sharing amongst the participating operating systems...\".<ref name=rfc871>RFC 871, ''A Perspective on the ARPANET Reference Model'', M.A. Padlipsky (September 1982)</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Computer networking}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Networking hardware]]"}]}}}}
