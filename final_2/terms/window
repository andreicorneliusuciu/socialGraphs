Paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. In England, glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened [[animal horn]] were used as early as the 14th century. In the 19th century American west, [[greased paper window]]s came to be used by itinerant groups. Modern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial [[plate glass|plate]] [[Glass production|glass making]] processes were perfected.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English language-word ''window'' originates from the [[Old Norse]] 'vindauga', from 'vindr \u2013 wind' and 'auga \u2013 eye', i.e., ''wind eye''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com |title=New Oxford American Dictionary |date=2010}}</ref> In  [[Norwegian Language|Norwegian]] [[Nynorsk]] and [[Icelandic Language|Icelandic]] the Old Norse form has survived to this day (in Icelandic only as a less used synonym to ''gluggi''), in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] the word ''vind\u00f6ga'' remains as a term for a hole through the roof of a hut, and in the Danish language 'vindue' and Norwegian [[Bokm\u00e5l]] 'vindu', the direct link to 'eye' is lost, just like for 'window'. The Danish (but not the Bokm\u00e5l) word is pronounced fairly similarly to ''window''.\n\n''Window'' is first recorded in the early 13th century, and originally referred to an unglazed hole in a roof. ''Window'' replaced the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''eag\u00feyrl'', which literally means 'eye-hole,' and 'eagduru' 'eye-door'. Many Germanic languages however adopted the Latin word 'fenestra' to describe a window with glass, such as [[Standard language|standard]] [[Swedish language|Swedish]] 'f\u00f6nster', or [[German language|German]] 'Fenster'. The use of ''window'' in English is probably because of the Scandinavian influence on the English language by means of [[loanwords]] during the [[Viking Age]].  In English the word ''fenester'' was used as a parallel until the mid-18th century. ''Fenestration'' is still used to describe the arrangement of windows within a [[fa\u00e7ade]], as well as ''[[defenestration]]'', meaning to throw something out of a window.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Roman window glass.jpg|thumb|upright|Fragment of a Roman window glass plate dated to 1st to 4th century A.D.<br />Note the obvious curvature, this is not a flat pane.]]\n[[File:MorellaSantaMariaWindow.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alabaster]] 'mullion' divided decorative windows in Santa Maria La Major church ([[Morella, Castell\u00f3n|Morella]], Spain).]]\n[[File:ValenciaCathedral2.JPG|thumb|thumb|upright|Alabaster window in the [[Valencia Cathedral]]. Note the asymmetrical, slanted left side of the wall-frame, which lets sun rays reach the chancel.]] \nThe earliest windows{{when|date=October 2016}} were just holes in a wall. Later,{{when|date=October 2016}} windows were covered with animal hide, cloth, or wood. [[Window shutter|Shutters]] that could be opened and closed came next.{{when|date=October 2016}} Over time, windows were built that both protected the inhabitants from the elements and transmitted light, using multiple small pieces of translucent material (such as flattened pieces of translucent animal horn, thin slices of [[marble]], or pieces of glass) set in frameworks of wood, iron or lead. In the Far East, paper was used to fill windows.<ref name=\"britannica.com\">{{cite web| url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/645175/window |title=Window\n|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref>\nThe Romans were the first known to use glass for windows, a technology likely first produced in Roman Egypt. Namely, in Alexandria ca. 100 AD cast glass windows, albeit with poor optical properties, began to appear, but these were small thick productions, little more than [[glass blowing|blown glass]] jars (cylindrical shapes) flattened out into sheets with circular striation patterns throughout. It would be over a millennium before a window glass became transparent enough to see through clearly, as we think of it now.\n\nOver the centuries techniques were developed to shear through one side of a blown glass [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] and produce thinner rectangular window panes from the same amount of glass material. This gave rise to tall narrow windows, usually separated by a vertical support called a mullion. [[Mullion]]ed glass windows were the windows of choice among [[Europe]]an well-to-do, whereas paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. In England, glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened animal horn were used as early as the 14th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Langley|first=Andrew|title=Medieval Life|series=Eyewitness|year=2011|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=1-4053-4545-4|page=16}}</ref>\n\nModern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial [[plate glass|plate]] [[Glass production|glass making]] processes were perfected. Modern windows are usually filled with glass, although a few are transparent plastic.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/>\n\n==Types==\n===Eyebrow===\nThe term eyebrow window is used in two ways: a curved top window in a wall or in an eyebrow [[dormer]]; and a row of small windows usually under the front eaves such as the [[James-Lorah House]] in Pennsylvania.<ref>Harris, Cyril M.. ''American architecture: an illustrated encyclopedia''. New York: W.W. Norton, 1998. Print.</ref>\n\n===Fixed===\nA window that cannot be opened, whose function is limited to allowing light to enter (unlike an unfixed window, which can open and close). Clerestory windows are often fixed. Transom windows may be fixed or operable. This type of window is used in situations where light or vision alone is needed as no ventilation is possible windows without the use of [[trickle vent]]s or overglass vents.\n\n===Single-hung sash===\nOne sash is movable (usually the bottom one) and the other fixed. This is the earlier form of sliding sash window, and is also cheaper.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/>\n\n===Double-hung sash===\nA [[sash window]] is the traditional style of window in the United Kingdom, and many other places that were formerly colonized by the UK, with two parts (sashes) that overlap slightly and slide up and down inside the frame. The two parts are not necessarily the same size; where the upper sash is smaller (shorter) it is termed a [[cottage window]]. Currently most new double-hung sash windows use spring balances to support the sashes, but traditionally, counterweights held in boxes on either side of the window were used. These were and are attached to the sashes using pulleys of either braided cord or, later, purpose-made chain. Three types of spring balances are called a tape or clock spring balance; channel or block-and-tackle balance; and a spiral or tube balance.\n\nDouble-hung sash windows were traditionally often fitted with [[Window shutter|shutters]]. Sash windows can be fitted with simplex hinges that let the window be locked into hinges on one side, while the rope on the other side is detached\u2014so the window can be opened for fire escape or cleaning.\n\n===Horizontal sliding sash===\nHas two or more sashes that overlap slightly but slide horizontally within the frame. In the UK, these are sometimes called ''[[Yorkshire]]'' sash windows, presumably because of their traditional use in that county.\n\n===Casement===\n{{main|Casement window}}\n[[File:Gordijnen aan venster.JPG|thumb|[[Casement window]]]]\n\nA window with a hinged sash that swings in or out like a door comprising either a side-hung, top-hung (also called \"awning window\"; see below), or occasionally bottom-hung sash or a combination of these types, sometimes with fixed panels on one or more sides of the sash.<ref name=\"Window\"/> In the USA, these are usually opened using a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]], but in parts of Europe they tend to use projection friction stays and [[espagnolette]] locking. Formerly, plain hinges were used with a [[casement stay]]. [[Handing]] applies to casement windows to determine direction of swing; a casement window may be left-handed, right-handed, or double. The casement window is the dominant type now found in modern buildings in the UK and many other parts of Europe.\n\n====Awning====\n[[File:Fen\u00eatre \u00e0 l'australienne - Awning window - (AWS Magnum 616) Light.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Awning window]]\nAn awning window is a casement window that is hung horizontally, [[hinge]]d on top, so that it swings outward like an [[awning]]. In addition to be used independently, they can be stacked, several in one opening, or combined with fixed glass. They are particularly useful for ventilation.<ref>{{cite book | title=Window Treatments | first=Karla J. | last=Nielson | page=45 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y6U0uP5cyLQC&pg=PA45&dq=%22awning+window%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLgJCejrbLAhVU3mMKHWJmBJUQ6AEINTAA#v=onepage&q=%22awning%20window%22&f=false | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | date=Sep 15, 1989 | isbn=0471289469}}</ref>\n\n====Hopper====\nA hopper window is a bottom-pivoting casement window that opens by tilting vertically, typically to the inside.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Edward|last2=Thallon|first2=Rob|title=Fundamentals of Residential Construction|edition=3|year=2011|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-470-54083-1|page=654}}</ref>\n(Mostly used for schools)\n\n===Pivot===\nA window hung on one hinge on each of two opposite sides which allows the window to revolve when opened. The hinges may be mounted top and bottom  (Vertically Pivoted) or at each jamb (Horizontally Pivoted). The window will usually  open initially to a restricted position for ventilation and, once released, fully reverse and lock again for safe cleaning from inside. Modern pivot hinges incorporate a friction device to hold the window open against its own weight and may have restriction and reversed locking built in. In the UK, where this type of  window is most common, they were extensively installed in high-rise social  housing.\n\n===Tilt and slide===\nA window (more usually a door-sized window) where the sash tilts inwards at the top and then slides horizontally behind the fixed pane.\n\n====Tilt and turn====\nA ''tilt and turn'' window can both tilt inwards at the top or open inwards from hinges at the side. This is the most common type of window in Germany, its country of origin. It is also widespread in many other European countries. In Europe it is usual for these to be of the \"turn first\" type. i.e. when the handle is turned to 90 degrees the window opens in the side hung mode. With the handle turned to 180 degrees the window opens in bottom hung mode. Most usually in the UK the windows will be \"tilt first\" i.e. bottom hung at 90 degrees for ventilation and side hung at 180 degrees for cleaning the outer face of the glass from inside the building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windowanddoor.com/article/products/will-tilt-and-turn-windows-gain-market-share-north-america?page=0%2C1 |title=Will Tilt-and-Turn Windows Gain Market Share in North America? &#124; Window & Door |publisher=Windowanddoor.com |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Transom===\nA window above a door; in an exterior door the [[Transom (architectural)|''transom]] window is often fixed, in an interior door it can open either by hinges at top or bottom, or rotate on hinges. It provided ventilation before forced air heating and cooling. A fan-shaped transom is known as a fanlight, especially in the British Isles.\n\n===Side light===\nWindows beside a door or window are called ''side''-, ''wing''-, and ''margen-lights'' and ''flanking windows''.<ref>Curl, James Stevens. \"Flanking window\".

They are used extensively in tropical architecture. A jalousie door is a door with a jalousie window.\n\n[[File:Cathedrale d'Amiens - Grandes verrieres et voutes de la nef.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Clerestory]] window]]\n\n===Clerestory===\n{{main|Clerestory}}\nA window set in a [[roof]] structure or high in a wall, used for [[daylighting]].\n\n===Skylight===\n{{main|Daylighting}}\n[[File:BurlingtonHousePavementWindow.jpg|thumbnail|Sidewalk skylight (also named 'pavement light') made of [[Glass brick]] in [[Burlington House]], [[London]]]]\n\nA flat or slope window used for daylighting, built into a roof structure that is out of reach.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.roofingnetworks.com/info/types-of-skylights/|title=Types of Skylights \u2013 All You Need to Know\n|publisher=Networx|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Roof===\n[[File:EdenProjectRoof.jpg|thumbnail|Hexagonal external cladding panels of roof in [[Eden Project]] Biomes ([[Cornwall]], England,)]]\nA sloped window used for [[daylighting]], built into a roof structure.

Larger [[roof window]]s meet building codes for emergency evacuation.\n\n===Roof lantern===\n{{main|Cupola}}\nA roof lantern is a multi-paned glass structure, resembling a small building, built on a roof for day or moon light. Sometimes includes an additional [[clerestory]]. May also be called a [[cupola]].\n\n===Bay===\n{{main|Bay window}}\nA multi-panel window, with at least three panels set at different angles to create a protrusion from the wall line.<ref name=\"Window\"/>\n\n====Oriel====\n{{main|Oriel window}}\nThis form of bay window most often appears in Tudor-style houses and monasteries. It projects from the wall and does not extend to the ground. Originally a form of porch, they are often supported by brackets or corbels.\n\n===Thermal===\n{{main|Diocletian window}}\nThermal, or Diocletian, windows are large semicircular windows (or niches) which are usually divided into three lights (window compartments) by two mullions. The central compartment is often wider than the two side lights on either side of it.\n\n===Picture===\nA picture window is a large fixed window in a wall, typically without glazing bars, or glazed with only perfunctory glazing bars near the edge of the window. Picture windows provide an unimpeded view, as if framing a picture.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/picture+window |title=Picture window |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Multi-lite===\nA window glazed with small panes of glass separated by wooden or lead ''glazing bars'', or ''[[muntins]]'', arranged in a decorative ''glazing pattern'' often dictated by the building's architectural style. Due to the historic unavailability of large panes of glass, the multi-lit (or ''lattice window'') was the most common window style until the beginning of the 20th century, and is still used in traditional architecture.\n\n===Emergency exit/egress===\nA window big enough and low enough so that occupants can escape through the opening in an emergency, such as a [[fire]]. In many countries, exact specifications for emergency windows in bedrooms are given in many [[building codes]]. Specifications for such windows may also allow for the entrance of emergency rescuers. Vehicles, such as [[bus]]es and [[aircraft]], frequently have emergency exit windows as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/documents/outreach/bus/PreTrip-SafetyBrochure-Pull.pdf |title=U.S. Dept. of Transportation: Safety information for bus/motorcoach passengers |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Stained glass===\n[[File:Nasir-al molk -1.jpg|thumb|Visual effect Sunlight shining through stained glass]]\n{{main|stained glass}}\nA window composed of pieces of colored glass, [[transparency (optics)|transparent, translucent]] or [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], frequently portraying persons or scenes.

Stained glass windows were popular in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] houses and some [[Frank Lloyd Wright|Wrightian]] houses, and are especially common in [[Church (building)|churches]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/stained+glass+window|title=Stained glass |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===French===\n{{multiple image|align=right|footer=Actual \"French window\" at the [[List of diplomatic missions of France|Embassy of France]] in [[Lisbon]], early 20th century.|width1=150|image1=Legation de France a Lisbonne (interieur).jpg|width2=149|image2=Legation de France a Lisbonne (v\u00e9randa).jpg}}\nA French window (when hinged ''French door'') is a large door-sized lattice light, typically set in pairs or multiples thereof.  Known as ''porte-fen\u00eatre'' in France and ''portafinestra'' in Italy, they often overlook a [[Terrace (building)|terrace]] and are commonly used in modern houses.\n<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/French+window|title=French Window |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref>\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===Double-paned===\nDouble-paned windows have two parallel panes (slabs of glass) with a separation of typically about 1&nbsp;cm; this space is permanently sealed and filled at the time of manufacture with dry air or other dry nonreactive gas. Such windows provide a marked improvement in thermal insulation (and usually in acoustic insulation as well) and are resistant to fogging and frosting caused by temperature differential. They are widely used for residential and commercial construction in intemperate climates. Triple-paned windows have been commercially manufactured and marketed with claims of additional benefit but have not become common.\n\n===Hexagonal window===\n{{main|hexagonal window}}\n\nA hexagonal window is a hexagon-shaped window, resembling a bee cell or crystal lattice of graphite. The window can be vertically or horizontally oriented, openable or dead. It can also be regular or elongately-shaped and can have a separator ([[mullion]]). Typically, the cellular window is used for an attic or as a decorative feature, but it can also be a major architectural element to provide the natural lighting inside buildings.\n\n==Terms==\nEN 12519 is the European norm that describes windows terms officially used in EU Member States.\nThe main terms are:\n[[File:Casement (PSF).jpg|thumb|Casement window, with [[Latticework|latticed]] lights]]\n*'''Light''', or '''Lite''', is the area between the outer parts of a window ([[Transom (architectural)|transom]], sill and jambs), usually filled with a glass pane.

The terms ''single-light'', ''double-light'', etc., refer to the number of these glass panes in a window.\n*'''Sash unit''' is a window consisting of at least one sliding glass component, typically composed of two lites (known as a ''double-light'').\n*'''Replacement window''' in the United States means a framed window designed to slip inside the original window frame from the inside after the old sashes are removed. In Europe it usually means a complete window including a replacement outer frame.\n*'''New construction window''', in the US, means a window with a nailing fin  that is inserted into a rough opening from the outside before applying siding and inside trim. A nailing fin is a projection on the outer frame of the window in the same plane as the [[glazing in architecture|glazing]], which overlaps the prepared opening, and can thus be 'nailed' into place.\n\n:In the UK and mainland Europe, windows in new-build houses are usually fixed with long screws into expanding plastic plugs in the brickwork.  A gap of up to 13 mm is left around all four sides, and filled with expanding [[polyurethane foam]].  This makes the window fixing weatherproof but allows for expansion due to heat.\n\n*'''[[Lintel]]''' is a beam over the top of a window, also known as a [[transom (architectural)|transom]].\n*'''[[Window sill]]''' is the bottom piece in a window frame. Window sills slant outward to drain water away from the inside of the building.\n*'''Secondary glazing''' is an additional frame applied to the inside of an existing frame, usually used on protected or listed buildings to achieve higher levels of thermal and sound insulation without compromising the look of the building\n*'''[[Millwork (building material)|Decorative millwork]] is the moulding, cornices and lintels often decorating the surrounding edges of the window.\n\n===Labeling===\nThe United States [[National Fenestration Rating Council|NFRC]] Window Label lists the following terms:\n* [[Thermal conductivity|Thermal transmittance (U-factor)]], best values are around U-0.15 (equal to 0.8 W/m2/K)\n* [[Solar heat gain coefficient]] (SHGC), ratio of solar heat (infrared) passing through the glass to incident solar heat\n* [[Visible transmittance]] (VT), ratio of transmitted visible light divided by incident visible light\n* [[airflow|Air leakage]] (AL), measured in cubic foot per minute per linear foot of crack between sash and frame\n* [[Damp (structural)#Condensation|Condensation resistance]] (CR), measured between 1 and 100 (the higher the number, the higher the resistance of the formation of condensation)<ref>[http://www.nfrc.org/documents/WindowsandHeatLoss.pdf Windows and Heat Loss], [[NFRC]] Heat Loss Fact Sheet</ref>\n\nThe European harmonised standard hEN 14351-1, which deals with doors and windows, defines 23 characteristics (divided into ''essential'' and ''non ''essential''. Two other, preliminary European Norms that are under development deal with internal pedestrian doors (prEN 14351-2), smoke and fire resisting doors, and openable windows (prEN 16034).<ref>[http://www.alueurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/CPR_guideline_Dec_2012_ver-1.pdf CPR guideline]</ref>\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:5-chamber plastic window profile.JPG|thumb|5-chamber plastic window profile]]\n[[File:Passivhaus Fenster Beispiele (blank).svg|thumb|Examples of modern plastic and wooden window profiles with [[insulated glazing]]]]\n[[File:WaterMill Window LymeRegis.jpg|thumb|Modern wooden framed window fitted in the 14th century [[Lyme Regis]] [[watermill]], [[UK]].]]\n\nWindows can be a significant source of heat transfer.<ref name=\"Window Systems\">Carmody, J., Selkowitz, S., Lee, E. S., Arasteh, D., & Willmert, T. (2004). ''Window Systems for High-Performance Buildings''. New York, NY: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc.</ref>  Therefore, [[Insulated glazing|insulated glazing units]] consist of two or more panes to reduce the transfer of heat.\n\n===Grids or muntins===\n\nThese are the pieces of framing that separate a larger window into smaller panes.  In older windows, large panes of glass were quite expensive, so muntins let smaller panes fill a larger space. In modern windows, light-colored muntins still provide a useful function by reflecting some of the light going through the window, making the window itself a source of diffuse light (instead of just the surfaces and objects illuminated within the room).  By increasing the indirect illumination of surfaces near the window, muntins tend to brighten the area immediately around a window and reduce the contrast of shadows within the room.\n\n===Frame and sash construction===\n\nFrames and sashes can be made of the following materials:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Because PVC is not as strong as other materials, some PVC frames are reinforced with metal or composite materials to improve their structural strength.\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> Modern aluminium window frames are typically separated by a [[thermal break]] made of a glass fibre reinforced polyamide. With a 34mm thermal insulation profile it is possible to reach Uf= 1.3 W/m\u00b2K for a metal window. This greatly increases thermal resistance, while retaining virtually all of the structural strength.\n\n[[composite material|Composites]] (also known as Hybrid Windows) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://scheelwindows.com/hybrid-2/|title=Hybrid Windows |publisher=Scheel Window & Door|date=April 21, 2013|accessdate=June 7, 2016}}</ref> may combine materials to obtain aesthetics of one material with the functional benefits of another.\n[[File:Bleekman zimmer.jpg|thumb|A typical installation of insulated glazing windows with uPVC window frames.]]\nA special class of PVC window frames, uPVC window frames, became widespread since the late 20th century, particularly in Europe: there were 83.5 million installed by 1998<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pritchard|first1=Geoffrey|title=Novel and Traditional Fillers for Plastics: Technology and Market Developments|year=1999|publisher=iSmithers Rapra Publishing|isbn=9781859571835|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3GWoyuMEckC&pg=PA95}}</ref> with numbers still growing as of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/Vinyl_doors_market/vinyl_windows_market/prweb9415523.htm|title=Global Vinyl Windows Market to Reach 163 Million Units by 2017, According to a New Report by Global Industry Analysts, Inc. |publisher=PRWeb|date=April 18, 2012|accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Glazing and filling===\n\n[[Low-emissivity]] coated panes reduce heat transfer by [[radiation]], which, depending on which surface is coated, helps prevent heat loss (in cold climates) or heat gains (in warm climates).\n\nHigh thermal resistance can be obtained by evacuating or filling the insulated glazing units with gases such as [[argon]] or [[krypton]], which reduces [[Heat conduction|conductive]] heat transfer due to their low thermal conductivity. Performance of such units depends on good window seals and meticulous frame construction to prevent entry of air and loss of efficiency.\n\nModern double-pane and triple-pane windows often include one or more low-e coatings to reduce the window's U-factor (its insulation value, specifically its rate of heat loss). In general, soft-coat low-e coatings tend to result in a lower solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) than hard-coat low-e coatings.\n\nModern windows are usually glazed with one large sheet of glass per sash, while windows in the past were glazed with multiple panes separated by ''glazing bars'', or ''muntins'', due to the unavailability of large sheets of glass. Today, glazing bars tend to be decorative, separating windows into small panes of glass even though larger panes of glass are available, generally in a pattern dictated by the architectural style at use. Glazing bars are typically wooden, but occasionally lead glazing bars soldered in place are used for more intricate glazing patterns.\n\n===Other construction details===\n\nMany windows have movable [[window covering]]s such as [[blinds]] or [[curtain]]s to keep out light, provide additional insulation, or ensure privacy.\nWindows allow natural light to enter, but too much can have negative effects such as glare and heat gain. Additionally, while windows let the user see outside, there must be a way to maintain privacy on in the inside.<ref name=\"Design Evaluation Project\">Howell, Sandra C. (1976).

Design Evaluation Project.</ref> Window coverings are practical accommodations for these issues.\n\n==Windows and the sun==\n{{main|Daylighting}}\n\n===Sun incidence angle===\n\nHistorically, windows are designed with surfaces parallel to vertical building walls.  Such a design allows considerable solar light and heat penetration due to the most commonly occurring incidence of sun angles. In [[passive solar building design]], an extended [[eave]] is typically used to control the amount of solar light and heat entering the window(s).\n\nAn alternative method is to calculate an optimum window mounting angle that accounts for summer sun load minimization, with consideration of actual latitude of the building. This process has been implemented, for example, in the [[Dakin Building]] in [[Brisbane, California]]\u2014in which most of the fenestration is designed to reflect summer heat load and help prevent summer interior [[over-illumination]] and glare, by canting windows to nearly a 45 degree angle.\n\n===Solar window===\n{{Main|Photovoltaics}}\n\nPhotovoltaic windows not only provide a clear view and illuminate rooms, but also convert sunlight to electricity for the building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2008/solarcells-0710.html |title=MIT opens new 'window' on solar energy |publisher=Web.mit.edu |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref> In most cases, translucent photovoltaic cells are used. Recently, hybrid-type transparent solar concentrator systems have been developed,<ref>Vasiliev, M. et al. Photonic microstructures for energy-generating clear glass and net-zero energy buildings. Sci. Rep. 6, 31831; {{doi|10.1038/srep31831}} (2016).</ref> which resulted in the industrial production of solar windows. These ClearVue solar PV windows also feature superior thermal insulation and solar control properties.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tu_qG21R08</ref>\n\n===Passive solar===\n\nPassive solar windows allow light and solar energy into a building while minimizing air leakage and heat loss. Properly positioning these windows in relation to sun, wind, and landscape\u2014while properly shading them to limit excess heat gain in summer and shoulder seasons, and providing thermal mass to absorb energy during the day and release it when temperatures cool at night\u2014increases comfort and energy efficiency. Properly designed in climates with adequate solar gain, these can even be a building's primary heating system.\n\n===Window coverings===\n\nA [[window covering]] is a shade or screen that provides multiple functions. For example, some window coverings control solar heat gain and glare. There are external shading devices and internal shading devices.<ref name=\"Windows\">Beckett, H. E., & Godfrey, J. A. (1974). ''Windows: Performance, design and installation''. New York, NY: Van Nostrand Reinhold Company.</ref> Low-e [[window film]] is a low-cost alternative to window replacement to transform existing poorly-insulating windows into energy-efficient windows. For high-rise buildings, [[smart glass]] can provide an alternative.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:TeaHouseWindowInuYama.jpg|Woven [[bamboo]] window in [[Japan]]\nFile:Obereisesheim Mauritiuskirche03.JPG|Church window\nFile:Berlin-K\u00f6penick - Spindlerwerke 6.jpg|Factory site in Berlin-Spindlersfeld: window with letter S for Spindler\nFile:Lan Su Chinese Garden, Portland, OR 2012 - window.JPG|Classical Chinese window in [[Lan Su Chinese Garden]]\nFile:Doubled window.jpg|Arab-style windows in [[Jerusalem]]\nFile:Arles-abadia-3.jpg|[[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]/[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] window from Abbey of St. Maria d'Arles\nFile:Desay madu jhya.jpg|[[Desay Madu Jhya (window)|Desay Madu Jhya]] traditional carved wooden window in [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]]\nFile:Half Glazed Window 17th Century.jpg|A half-glazed window of the 17th century from [[Scotland]]\nFile:Washington DC windows.jpg|Windows of a brick building in Washington DC\nFile:Villa Majorelle fen\u00e8tre 02 by Line1.jpg|Window, [[Villa Majorelle]], France\nFile:Asymmetrische Fenster.JPG|Asymmetrical windows at a building in the backyard of an arts museum in [[Osnabr\u00fcck]], Germany\nFile:Wooden Window.JPG|An old decorated wooden window\nFile:NN Trade Fair 08-2016 img3.jpg|A [[Russian Revival]]-style window\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=11em}}\n* [[Airflow window]]\n* [[Display window]]\n* [[g-factor (physics)]]\n* [[Glass mullion system]]\n* [[Insulated glazing]]\n* [[Porthole]]\n* [[Rose window]]\n* [[Window tax]]\n* [[Window treatment]]\n* [[Witch window]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Commons category|Windows}}\n*[http://www.alueurope.eu/publications-building/ European Aluminium Association's publications dedicated to Buildings]\n*[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rgls/hd_rgls.htm Roman Glass from Metropolitan Museum of Art]\n*[http://www.nfrc.org National Fenestration Rating Council] (NFRC), a non-profit organization, administers an independent, uniform rating and labeling system for the energy performance of fenestration products.
