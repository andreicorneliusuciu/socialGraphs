Electromagnetic induction produces an [[electromotive force]] within a conductor which is exposed to time varying [[magnetic field]]s. Transformers are used to increase or decrease the alternating voltages in electric power applications.\n\nA varying current in the transformer's primary winding creates a varying [[magnetic flux]] in the transformer core and a varying field impinging on the transformer's secondary winding. This varying [[magnetic field]] at the secondary winding induces a varying [[electromotive force]] (EMF) or voltage in the secondary winding due to electromagnetic induction. Making use of [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's Law]] (discovered in 1831) in conjunction with high [[permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic permeability]] core properties, transformers can be designed to efficiently change [[alternating current|AC]] voltages from one voltage level to another within power networks.\n\nSince the invention of the first constant [[potential energy|potential]] transformer in 1885, transformers have become essential for the [[electric power transmission|transmission]], [[electric power distribution|distribution]], and utilization of alternating current electrical energy.<ref name=\"Bedell (1942)\">{{cite journal|last1=Bedell|first1=Frederick|title=History of A-C Wave Form, Its Determination and Standardization|journal=Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers|volume=61|issue=12|page=864|doi=10.1109/T-AIEE.1942.5058456}}</ref> A wide range of transformer designs is encountered in electronic and electric power applications.

These materials combine high magnetic permeability with high bulk electrical [[resistivity]]. For frequencies extending beyond the [[Very high frequency|VHF band]], cores made from non-conductive magnetic [[ceramic]] materials called [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrites]] are common.<ref name=\"McLyman (2004)\"/> Some radio-frequency transformers also have movable cores (sometimes called 'slugs') which allow adjustment of the [[coupling coefficient]] (and [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]) of tuned radio-frequency circuits.\n\n====Toroidal cores====\n[[Image:Small toroidal transformer.jpg|thumb|right|Small toroidal core transformer]]\nToroidal transformers are built around a ring-shaped core, which, depending on operating frequency, is made from a long strip of [[silicon steel]] or [[permalloy]] wound into a coil, powdered iron, or [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]].<ref>McLyman, Chap. 3 p. 1</ref> A strip construction ensures that the [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]] are optimally aligned, improving the transformer's efficiency by reducing the core's [[reluctance]]. The closed ring shape eliminates air gaps inherent in the construction of an E-I core.<ref name=\"Say, p. 485\"/> The cross-section of the ring is usually square or rectangular, but more expensive cores with circular cross-sections are also available. The primary and secondary coils are often wound concentrically to cover the entire surface of the core. This minimizes the length of wire needed and provides screening to minimize the core's magnetic field from generating [[electromagnetic interference]].\n\nToroidal transformers are more efficient than the cheaper laminated E-I types for a similar power level. Other advantages compared to E-I types, include smaller size (about half), lower weight (about half), less mechanical hum (making them superior in audio amplifiers), lower exterior magnetic field (about one tenth), low off-load losses (making them more efficient in standby circuits), single-bolt mounting, and greater choice of shapes. The main disadvantages are higher cost and limited power capacity (see [[transformer#Classification parameters|Classification parameters]] below). Because of the lack of a residual gap in the magnetic path, toroidal transformers also tend to exhibit higher inrush current, compared to laminated E-I types.\n\nFerrite toroidal cores are used at higher frequencies, typically between a few tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz, to reduce losses, physical size, and weight of inductive components. A drawback of toroidal transformer construction is the higher labor cost of winding. This is because it is necessary to pass the entire length of a coil winding through the core aperture each time a single turn is added to the coil. As a consequence, toroidal transformers rated more than a few kVA are uncommon. Relatively few toroids are offered with power ratings above 10&nbsp;kVA, and practically none above 25&nbsp;kVA. Small distribution transformers may achieve some of the benefits of a toroidal core by splitting it and forcing it open, then inserting a bobbin containing primary and secondary windings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.magneticsmagazine.com/main/articles/toroidal-line-power-transformers-power-ratings-tripled/|title=Toroidal Line Power Transformers.

The air which comprises the magnetic circuit is essentially lossless, and so an air-core transformer eliminates loss due to hysteresis in the core material.<ref name=\"calvert\"/> The leakage inductance is inevitably high, resulting in very poor regulation, and so such designs are unsuitable for use in power distribution.<ref name=\"calvert\"/> They have however very high [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], and are frequently employed in radio-frequency applications,<ref>{{cite web\n| first = Reuben\n| last = Lee\n| title = Air-Core Transformers\n| work = Electronic Transformers and Circuits\n| url = http://www.vias.org/eltransformers/lee_electronic_transformers_07b_22.html | accessdate=May 22, 2007}}</ref> for which a satisfactory coupling coefficient is maintained by carefully overlapping the primary and secondary windings.

Taps may be manually reconnected, or a manual or automatic switch may be provided for changing taps. Automatic on-load [[tap changer]]s are used in electric power transmission or distribution, on equipment such as [[arc furnace]] transformers, or for automatic voltage regulators for sensitive loads.

Drying is carried out at the factory, and may also be required as a field service. Drying may be done by circulating hot air around the core, or by vapor-phase drying (VPD) where an evaporated solvent transfers heat by condensation on the coil and core.\n\nFor small transformers, resistance heating by injection of current into the windings is used. The heating can be controlled very well, and it is energy efficient. The method is called low-frequency heating (LFH) since the current used is at a much lower frequency than that of the power grid, which is normally 50 or 60&nbsp;Hz. A lower frequency reduces the effect of inductance, so the voltage required can be reduced.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fink|first= Donald G.|author2= Beatty, H.

Wires have [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] which loses energy through joule heating at a rate corresponding to square of the current. By transforming power to a higher voltage transformers enable economical transmission of power and distribution. Consequently, transformers have shaped the [[Electrical power industry|electricity supply industry]], permitting generation to be located remotely from points of [[electrical load|demand]].<ref>Heathcote, p. 1</ref> All but a tiny fraction of the world's electrical power has passed through a series of transformers by the time it reaches the consumer.<ref name=\"nailen\"/>\n\nSince the high voltages carried in the wires are significantly greater than what is needed in-home, transformers are also used extensively in [[Consumer electronics|electronic products]] to decrease (or step-down) the supply voltage to a level suitable for the low voltage circuits they contain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean-energy/how-electricity-grid-works|title=How the Electricity Grid Works|access-date=2016-09-23}}</ref> The transformer also electrically isolates the end user from contact with the supply voltage.\n\nSignal and audio transformers are used to couple stages of [[amplifier]]s and to match devices such as [[microphone]]s and [[record player]]s to the input of amplifiers. Audio transformers allowed [[telephone]] circuits to carry on a [[Hybrid coil|two-way conversation]] over a single pair of wires. A [[balun]] transformer converts a signal that is referenced to ground to a signal that has [[Balanced line|balanced voltages to ground]], such as between external cables and internal circuits.

[[Nicholas Callan]] of [[Maynooth College]], Ireland in 1836.<ref name=\"Guarnieri 2013 56\u201359\"/> He was one of the first researchers to realize the more turns the secondary winding has in relation to the primary winding, the larger the induced secondary EMF will be. Induction coils evolved from scientists' and inventors' efforts to get higher voltages from batteries. Since batteries produce [[direct current|direct current (DC)]] rather than AC, induction coils relied upon vibrating [[electrical contact]]s that regularly interrupted the current in the primary to create the flux changes necessary for induction. Between the 1830s and the 1870s, efforts to build better induction coils, mostly by trial and error, slowly revealed the basic principles of transformers.\n\n===First alternating current transformers===\nBy the 1870s, efficient [[Electric generator|generators]] producing [[alternating current|alternating current (AC)]] were available, and it was found AC could power an induction coil directly, without an [[interrupter]].\n\nIn 1876, Russian engineer [[Pavel Yablochkov]] invented<ref>French patent No.115793 granted to Jablochkoff on November 30, 1876 with the title \"Disposition de courants, destin\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9clairage par la lumi\u00e8re \u00e9lectrique\", reference to it is available in the following book: {{cite book|title=Subject-Matter Index of Patents for Inventions (Brevets D'Invention) Granted in France from 1791 to 1876 Inclusive|location=Washington|year=1883|pages=248|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924021895739#page/n261/mode/2up}}</ref> a lighting system based on a set of induction coils where the primary windings were connected to a source of AC.

Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil.<ref name=FJU1889/>\nEfficient, practical transformer designs did not appear until the 1880s, but within a decade, the transformer would be instrumental in the [[War of Currents]], and in seeing AC distribution systems triumph over their DC counterparts, a position in which they have remained dominant ever since.<ref name=\"Coltman\">{{Cite news\n| last = Coltman\n| first = J.
