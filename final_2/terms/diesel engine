Diesel engines work by compressing only the air. This increases the air temperature inside the cylinder to such a high degree that it ignites atomised diesel fuel that is injected into the  combustion chamber. This contrasts with spark-ignition engines such as a [[petrol engine]] ([[gasoline]] engine) or [[gas engine]] (using a gaseous fuel as opposed to [[petrol]]), which use a [[spark plug]] to ignite an air-fuel mixture. In compression-ignition engines, glow plugs (combustion chamber pre-warmers) may be used to aid starting in cold weather, or when the engine uses a lower compression-ratio, or both. The original compression-ignition engine operates on the \"constant pressure\" cycle of gradual combustion and produces no audible knock.\n\n[[File:Dieselmotor vs.jpg|thumb|upright|A diesel engine built by [[MAN SE|MAN AG]] in 1906]]\n[[File:Detroit Diesel timing.jpg|thumb|Detroit Diesel timing]]\n[[File:Fairbanks Morse model 32.jpg|thumb|Fairbanks Morse model 32]]\n\nThe compression-ignition engine has the highest [[thermal efficiency]] ([[engine efficiency]]) of any practical [[internal combustion|internal]] or [[external combustion]] engine due to its very high [[expansion ratio]] and inherent [[lean mixture|lean]] burn which enables heat dissipation by the excess air. A small efficiency loss is also avoided compared to two-stroke non-direct-injection gasoline engines since unburnt fuel is not present at valve overlap and therefore no fuel goes directly from the intake/injection to the exhaust. Low-speed compression-ignition engines (as used in ships and other applications where overall engine weight is relatively unimportant) can have a thermal efficiency that exceeds 50%.<ref name=\"bmmWW \">[http://mandieselturbo.com/files/news/filesof16119/tech_paper_low_speed.pdf Low Speed Engines Tech Paper], MAN Diesel</ref><ref name=\"mhi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mhi.co.jp/technology/review/pdf/e451/e451021.pdf |title=Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Technical Review Vol.45 No.1 (2008) |format=PDF |accessdate=October 3, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5tDljlTm4?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mhi.co.jp%2Ftechnology%2Freview%2Fpdf%2Fe451%2Fe451021.pdf |archivedate=October 4, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nCompression-ignition engines are manufactured in [[two-stroke]] and [[four-stroke]] versions. They were originally used as a more efficient replacement for stationary [[steam engine]]s. Since the 1910s they have been used in [[submarine]]s and ships. Use in locomotives, trucks, [[heavy equipment]] and electricity generation plants followed later. In the 1930s, they slowly began to be used in a few [[automobile]]s. Since the 1970s, the use of compression-ignition engines in larger on-road and [[off-road vehicle]]s in the US increased.

To some it may be an engine that uses heavy fuel oil. To others an engine that does not use spark ignition. However the original cycle proposed by [[Rudolph Diesel]] in 1892 was a constant temperature cycle (a cycle based on the Carnot theory) which would require much higher compression than what is needed for compression ignition. Diesel's idea was to compress the air so tightly that the temperature of the air would exceed that of combustion. In his 1892 US patent (granted in 1895) #542846 Diesel describes the compression required for his cycle:\n:\"pure atmospheric air is compressed, according to curve 1 2, to such a degree that, before ignition or combustion takes place, the highest pressure of the diagram and the highest temperature are obtained-that is to say, the temperature at which the subsequent combustion has to take place, not the burning or igniting point. To make this more clear, let it be assumed that the subsequent combustion shall take place at a temperature of 700\u00b0. Then in that case the initial pressure must be sixty-four atmospheres, or for 800\u00b0 centigrade the pressure must be ninety atmospheres, and so on. Into the air thus compressed is then gradually introduced from the exterior finely divided fuel, which ignites on introduction, since the air is at a temperature far above the igniting-point of the fuel. The characteristic features of the cycle according to my present invention are therefore, increase of pressure and temperature up to the maximum, not by combustion, but prior to combustion by mechanical compression of air, and there upon the subsequent performance of work without increase of pressure and temperature by gradual combustion during a prescribed part of the stroke determined by the cut-oil\".<ref>US patent (granted in 1895) [http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=00542846&SectionNum=2&IDKey=1BB1E16A8D0F&HomeUrl=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526d=PALL%2526p=1%2526u=%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r=1%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526s1=0542846.PN.%2526OS=PN/0542846%2526RS=PN/0542846 #542846 pdfpiw.uspto.gov]</ref>\n\nIn later years Diesel realized his original cycle would not work and he adopted the constant pressure cycle. Diesel describes the cycle in his 1895 patent application. Notice that there is no longer a mention of compression temperatures exceeding the temperature of combustion. Now all that is mentioned is the compression must be high enough for ignition.\n:\"1.

The [[Pyr\u00e9olophore]] fuel system used a blast of air provided by a bellows to atomize Lycopodium (a highly combustible fuel made from broad moss). Later coal dust mixed with resin became the fuel. Finally in 1816 they experimented with alcohol and white oil of petroleum (a fuel similar to kerosene). They discovered that the kerosene type fuel could be finely vaporized by passing it through a reed type device, this made the fuel highly combustible.\n\nIn 1874 [[George Brayton]] developed and patented a 2 stroke, oil fueled constant pressure engine \"The Ready Motor\". This engine used a metered pump to supply fuel to an injection device in which the oil was vaporize by air and burned as it entered the cylinder.<ref>[http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=00151468&PageNum=1&IDKey=AC9B121C262A&HomeUrl=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526d=PALL%2526p=1%2526u=%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r=1%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526s1=0151468.PN.%2526OS=PN/0151468%2526RS=PN/0151468 Patent # 151468]</ref> These were some of the first practical internal combustion engines to supply motive power.

In 1887 Brayton developed and patented a 4 stroke direct injection oil engine (US patent #432,114 of 1890, application filed in 1887) The fuel system used a variable quantity pump and liquid fuel high pressure spray type injection. The liquid was forced through a spring loaded relief type valve (injector) which caused the fuel to become divided into small droplets (vaporized). Injection was timed to occur at or near the peak of the compression stroke. A platinum igniter or ignitor provided the source of ignition. Brayton describes the invention as follows: \"I have discovered that heavy oils can be mechanically converted into a finely-divided condition within a firing portion of the cylinder, or in a communicating firing chamber.\" Another part reads \"I have for the first time, so far as my knowledge extends, regulated speed by variably controlling the direct discharge of liquid fuel into the combustion chamber or cylinder into a finely-divided condition highly favorable to immediate combustion\". This was likely the first engine to use a lean burn system to regulate engine speed / output. In this manner the engine fired on every power stroke and speed / output was controlled solely by the quantity of fuel injected.\n\nIn 1890 Brayton developed and patented a 4 stroke air blast oil engine (US patent #432,260)<ref>[http://vintagemachinery.org/mfgindex/imagedetail.aspx?id=6367 Brayton air blast engine]</ref> The fuel system delivered a variable quantity of vaporized fuel to the center of the cylinder under pressure at or near the peak of the compression stroke. The ignition source was an igniter made from platinum wire. A variable quantity injection pump provided the fuel to an injector where it was mixed with air as it entered the cylinder. A small crank driven compressor provided the source for air. This engine also used the lean burn system.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bppDAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=brayton+engine+warwick+show+1892&source=bl&ots=hyqfmF0_q1&sig=-6SWhodr-q3HX5RRpIboXn4x6oo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiRrr6nuP3OAhVNwWMKHWWQB1UQ6AEIJTAB#v=onepage&q=brayton%20engine%20warwick%20show%201892&f=false Engineering 1892]</ref>\n\nBrayton died in 1893 but would be credited with the invention of the constant pressure [[Brayton cycle]].\n\nIn 1885, the [[UK|English]] inventor [[Herbert Akroyd Stuart]] began investigating the possibility of using [[Kerosene|paraffin oil]] (very similar to modern-day [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]) for an engine, which unlike [[Gasoline|petrol]] would be difficult to vaporise in a carburettor as its [[Volatility (physics)|volatility]] is not sufficient to allow this.<ref name=\"aoi\">{{cite web|title=The Akroyd Oil Engine|publisher=Ray Hooley's\u2014Ruston-Hornsby\u2014Engine Pages|url=http://www.oldengine.org/members/ruston/History6.htm|doi=|accessdate= 2007-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Diesel has come a long way but still doesn't get the tax breaks it deserves|publisher=[[The Scotsman]], Scotland on Sunday|date=2003-01-16|url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/business.cfm?id=197272003|format=|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-29}}</ref>\n\nThe [[hot bulb engine]]s, first prototyped in 1886 and built from 1891 by [[Richard Hornsby & Sons|Richard Hornsby and Sons]], used a pressurized [[fuel injection]] system.<ref name=rwallis>{{cite book | last = Ransome-Wallis | first = Patrick | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Illustrated Encyclopedia of World Railway Locomotives | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | year = 2001 | location = | page = 28 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-486-41247-4}}</ref> The [[Hornsby-Akroyd oil engine]] engine used a comparatively low compression ratio, so that the temperature of the air compressed in the combustion chamber at the end of the compression stroke was not high enough to initiate combustion.

In the same year, [[Barton Transport|Thomas Henry Barton]] at Hornsbys built a working high-compression version for experimental purposes, whereby the vaporiser was replaced with a [[cylinder head]], therefore not relying on air being preheated, but by combustion through higher [[compression ratio]]s.

The cycle follows the numbers 1\u20134 in clockwise direction. The horizontal axis is Volume of the cylinder.  In the diesel cycle the combustion occurs at almost constant pressure. On this diagram the work that is generated for each cycle corresponds to the area within the loop.]]\n[[File:Model Engine Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|Diesel engine model, left side]]\n[[File:Model Engine B Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|Diesel engine model, right side]]\n{{See also|Diesel cycle|Reciprocating internal combustion engine}}\n\nThe diesel internal combustion engine differs from the gasoline powered [[Otto cycle]] by using highly compressed hot air to ignite the fuel rather than using a spark plug (''compression ignition'' rather than ''spark ignition'').\n\nIn the true diesel engine, only air is initially introduced into the combustion chamber. The air is then compressed with a compression ratio typically between 15:1 and 23:1. This high compression causes the temperature of the air to rise. At about the top of the compression stroke, fuel is injected directly into the compressed air in the combustion chamber. This may be into a (typically [[toroid]]al) void in the top of the piston or a ''pre-chamber'' depending upon the design of the engine. The fuel injector ensures that the fuel is broken down into small droplets, and that the fuel is distributed evenly. The heat of the compressed air vaporizes fuel from the surface of the droplets. The vapour is then ignited by the heat from the compressed air in the combustion chamber, the droplets continue to vaporise from their surfaces and burn, getting smaller, until all the fuel in the droplets has been burnt. Combustion occurs at a substantially constant pressure during the initial part of the power stroke.  The start of vaporisation causes a delay before ignition and the characteristic diesel knocking sound as the vapour reaches ignition temperature and causes an abrupt increase in pressure above the piston (not shown on the P-V indicator diagram). When combustion is complete the combustion gases expand as the piston descends further; the high pressure in the cylinder drives the piston downward, supplying power to the crankshaft.<ref>[[Combined gas law]]</ref>\n\nAs well as the high level of compression allowing combustion to take place without a separate ignition system, a high [[compression ratio]] greatly increases the engine's efficiency. Increasing the compression ratio in a spark-ignition engine where fuel and air are mixed before entry to the cylinder is limited by the need to prevent damaging [[pre-ignition#Pre-ignition|pre-ignition]]<!--- detonation from occurring after ignition and is more a fuel quality or combustion chamber design issue --->. Since only air is compressed in a diesel engine, and fuel is not introduced into the cylinder until shortly before top dead centre ([[Top Dead Center|TDC]]), premature detonation is not a problem and compression ratios are much higher.\n\nThe p\u2013V diagam is a simplified and idealised representation of the events involved in a Diesel engine cycle, arranged to illustrate the similarity with a [[Carnot cycle]].  Starting at 1, the piston is at bottom dead centre and both valves are closed at the start of the compression stroke; the cylinder contains air at atmospheric pressure.  Between 1 and 2 the air is compressed adiabatically\u2014that is without heat transfer to or from the environment\u2014by the rising piston.  (This is only approximately true since there will be some heat exchange with the cylinder walls.) During this compression, the volume is reduced, the pressure and temperature both rise.  At or slightly before 2 (TDC) fuel is injected and burns in the compressed hot air. Chemical energy is released and this constitutes an injection of thermal energy (heat) into the compressed gas.  Combustion and heating occur between 2 and 3.  In this interval the pressure remains constant since the piston descends, and the volume increases; the temperature rises as a consequence of the energy of combustion. At 3 fuel injection and combustion are complete, and the cylinder contains gas at a higher temperature than at 2.  Between 3 and 4 this hot gas expands, again approximately adiabatically. Work is done on the system to which the engine is connected.  During this expansion phase the volume of the gas rises, and its temperature and pressure both fall. At 4 the exhaust valve opens, and the pressure falls abruptly to atmospheric (approximately).  This is unresisted expansion and no useful work is done by it.  Ideally the adiabatic expansion should continue, extending the line 3\u20134 to the right until the pressure falls to that of the surrounding air, but the loss of efficiency caused by this unresisted expansion is justified by the practical difficulties involved in recovering it (the engine would have to be much larger).  After the opening of the exhaust valve, the exhaust stroke follows, but this (and the following induction stroke) are not shown on the diagram.  If shown, they would be represented by a low-pressure loop at the bottom of the diagram.  At 1 it is assumed that the exhaust and induction strokes have been completed, and the cylinder is again filled with air.  The piston-cylinder system absorbs energy between 1 and 2\u2014this is the work needed to compress the air in the cylinder, and is provided by mechanical kinetic energy stored in the flywheel of the engine.  Work output is done by the piston-cylinder combination between 2 and 4. The difference between these two increments of work is the indicated work output per cycle, and is represented by the area enclosed by the p\u2013V loop.  The adiabatic expansion is in a higher pressure range than that of the compression because the gas in the cylinder is hotter during expansion than during compression.  It is for this reason that the loop has a finite area, and the net output of work during a cycle is positive.\n\n===Major advantages===\n<!-- Editors take note!!!  This is just a summary section.  Expanded discussions of most of these items appear later in the article.  These descriptions should not be expanded without a compelling reason, probably discussed on the talk page first.  If there's an advantage not listed here that you think is important, consider whether it is really one of the few major ones that should be listed here, or whether it belongs in the full discussion of advantages later in the article. -->\n\nDiesel engines have several advantages over other internal combustion engines:\n* They burn less fuel than a petrol engine performing the same work, due to the engine's higher temperature of combustion and greater expansion ratio.<ref name=\"bmmWW\"/> Gasoline engines are typically 30% efficient while diesel engines can convert over 45% of the fuel energy into mechanical energy (see [[Carnot cycle]] for further explanation).<ref>[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/pdfs/basics/jtb_diesel_engine.pdf \"Diesel Engine.\"] Freedom CAR & Vehicle Technologies Program.

The absence of coils, spark plug wires, etc., also eliminates a source of [[Electromagnetic interference|radio frequency emissions]] which can interfere with navigation and communication equipment, which is especially important in marine and aircraft applications, and for preventing interference with [[radio telescope]]s.\n* The longevity of a diesel engine is generally about twice that of a petrol engine due to the increased strength of parts used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedieselpage.com/mileage.htm |title=When Used under Identical Operating Conditions, a Diesel Engine Will Likely Produce at Least Twice the Engine Life of a Gas Engine |website=TheDieselPage.com |accessdate=October 3, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uL1I5QR5?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedieselpage.com%2Fmileage.htm |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Belzowski|first=Bruce|date=March 2013|title=Total Cost of Ownership: A Gas Versus Diesel Comparison|url=http://www.dieselforum.org/files/dmfile/20130311_cd_umtritcofinalreport_dd2017.pdf|journal=University of Michigan|accessdate=April 10, 2016}}</ref> Diesel fuel has better lubrication properties than petrol as well. Indeed, in [[unit injector]]s, the fuel is employed for three distinct purposes: injector lubrication, injector cooling and injection for combustion.\n* [[File:Soybeanbus.jpg|thumb|Bus powered by [[biodiesel]]]] [[Diesel fuel]] is distilled directly from petroleum.  Distillation yields some gasoline, but the yield would be inadequate without [[catalytic reforming]], which is a more costly process.\n* Although diesel fuel will burn in open air using a [[Candle wick|wick]], it does not release a large amount of flammable vapor which could lead to an explosion.  The low [[vapor pressure]] of diesel is especially advantageous in marine applications, where the accumulation of explosive fuel-air mixtures is a particular hazard.  For the same reason, diesel engines are immune to [[vapor lock]].\n* For any given partial load the [[fuel efficiency]] (mass burned per energy produced) of a diesel engine remains nearly constant, as opposed to petrol and turbine engines which use proportionally more fuel with partial power outputs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centralmainediesel.com/order/H11000E5.asp?page=H11000E5 |title=Triple-Fuel Honda Powered 12&nbsp;kW Generator |website=CentralMaineDiesel.com |accessdate=May 11, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uL1Ibdf7?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.centralmainediesel.com%2Forder%2FH11000E5.asp%3Fpage%3DH11000E5 |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dieselserviceandsupply.com/Diesel_Fuel_Consumption.aspx |title=Approximate Diesel Generator Fuel Consumption Chart |website=DieselServiceAndSupply.com |accessdate=May 11, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uL1IxL6E?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dieselserviceandsupply.com%2FDiesel_Fuel_Consumption.aspx |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>Ransome-Wallis, Patrick (2001).

The nozzle opening was closed by a pin valve lifted by the camshaft to initiate the fuel injection before top dead centre ([[Top Dead Center|TDC]]). This is called an '''air-blast injection'''. Driving the compressor used some power but the efficiency and net power output was more than any other combustion engine at that time.<ref>Needs citation?</ref>\n\nDiesel engines in service today raise the fuel to extreme pressures by mechanical pumps and deliver it to the combustion chamber by pressure-activated injectors without compressed air. With direct injected diesels, injectors spray fuel through 4 to 12 small orifices in its nozzle. The early air injection diesels always had a superior combustion without the sharp increase in pressure during combustion. Research is now being performed and patents are being taken out to again use some form of air injection to reduce the nitrogen oxides and pollution, reverting to Diesel's original implementation with its superior combustion and possibly quieter operation. In all major aspects, the modern diesel engine holds true to Rudolf Diesel's original design, that of igniting fuel by compression at an extremely high pressure within the cylinder. With much higher pressures and high technology injectors, present-day diesel engines use the so-called solid injection system applied by [[Herbert Akroyd Stuart]] for his [[hot bulb engine]]. The [[indirect injection]] engine could be considered the latest development of these low speed ''hot bulb'' ignition engines.\n\n===Fuel delivery===\n\nOver the years many different injection methods have been used. These can be described as:\n\n* Air blast, where the fuel is blown into the cylinder by a blast of air.  \n* Solid fuel / hydraulic injection where the fuel is pushed through a spring loaded valve / injector to produce a combustable mist.\n* Mechanical Unit injector where the injector is directly operated by a cam and fuel quantity is controlled by a rack or lever .\n* Mechanical Electronic Unit Injector where the injector is operated by a cam and fuel quantity is controlled electronically.\n* Common Rail Mechanical Injection, Fuel is at high pressure in a common rail and controlled by mechanical means. \n* Common Rail electronic injection, Fuel is at high pressure in a common rail and controlled electronically.\n\n \nDiesel engines are also produced with two significantly different injection locations. \"Direct\" and \"Indirect\". Indirect injected engines place the injector in a pre-combustion chamber in the head which due to thermal losses generally require a \"glow plug\" to start and very high compression ratio, usually in the range of 21:1 to 23:1 ratio. Direct injected engines use a generally donut shaped combustion chamber void on the top of the piston. Thermal efficiency losses are significantly lower in DI engines which facilitates a much lower compression ratio generally between 14:1 and 20:1 but most DI engines are closer to 17:1. The direct injected process is significantly more internally violent and thus requires careful design, and more robust construction. The lower compression ratio also creates challenges for emissions due to partial burn. Turbocharging is particularly suited to DI engines since the low compression ratio facilitates meaningful forced induction, and the increase in airflow allows capturing additional fuel efficiency not only from more complete combustion, but also from lowering parasitic efficiency losses when properly operated, by widening both power and efficiency curves. The violent combustion process of direct injection also creates more noise, but modern designs using \"split shot\" injectors or similar multi shot processes have dramatically amended this issue by firing a small charge of fuel before the main delivery which pre-charges the combustion chamber for a less abrupt and in most cases slightly cleaner burn.{citation needed}\n\nA vital component of all diesel engines is a mechanical or electronic [[governor (device)|governor]] which regulates the idling speed and maximum speed of the engine by controlling the rate of fuel delivery.  Unlike Otto-cycle engines, incoming air is not throttled and a diesel engine without a governor cannot have a stable idling speed and can easily overspeed, resulting in its destruction.  Mechanically governed fuel injection systems are driven by the engine's [[gear train]].<ref name=\"buckman\">[http://www.oldengine.org/members/diesel/Ambac/AmbacMenu1.htm American Bosch Diesel Information Service Manual], fig.3\u20134, 3\u20135; [http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/jag/vw/engine/fi/injpump.html Robert Bosch type VE Diesel injection pump]</ref>  These systems use a combination of springs and weights to control fuel delivery relative to both load and speed.<ref name=buckman/>  Modern electronically controlled diesel engines control fuel delivery by use of an electronic control module (ECM) or electronic control unit ([[electronic control unit|ECU]]).  The ECM/ECU receives an engine speed signal, as well as other operating parameters such as intake manifold pressure and fuel temperature, from a sensor and controls the amount of fuel and start of injection timing through [[actuator]]s to maximise power and efficiency and minimise emissions.  Controlling the timing of the start of injection of fuel into the cylinder is a key to minimizing emissions, and maximizing [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] (efficiency), of the engine.  The timing is measured in degrees of crank angle of the [[piston]] before top dead centre.  For example, if the ECM/ECU initiates fuel injection when the piston is 10\u00b0 before [[Top Dead Centre|TDC]], the start of injection, or timing, is said to be 10\u00b0 [[BTDC]].  Optimal timing will depend on the engine design as well as its speed and load, and is usually 4\u00b0 BTDC in 1,350\u20136,000 HP, net, \"medium speed\" locomotive, marine and stationary diesel engines.\n\nAdvancing the start of injection (injecting before the piston reaches to its SOI-TDC) results in higher in-cylinder pressure and temperature, and higher efficiency, but also results in increased engine noise due to faster cylinder pressure rise and increased [[oxides of nitrogen]] (NO<sub>x</sub>) formation due to higher combustion temperatures.  Delaying start of injection causes incomplete combustion, reduced fuel efficiency and an increase in exhaust smoke, containing a considerable amount of particulate matter and unburned [[hydrocarbon]]s. {citation needed}\n\n===Mechanical and electronic injection===\nMany configurations of fuel injection have been used over the course of the 20th century.\n\nMost present-day diesel engines use a mechanical single plunger high-pressure [[fuel pump]] driven by the engine crankshaft. For each engine cylinder, the corresponding plunger in the fuel pump measures out the correct amount of fuel and determines the timing of each injection. These engines use [[fuel injection|injector]]s that are very precise spring-loaded valves that open and close at a specific fuel pressure. Separate high-pressure fuel lines connect the fuel pump with each cylinder. Fuel volume for each single combustion is controlled by a slanted [[Groove (engineering)|groove]] in the plunger which rotates only a few degrees releasing the pressure and is controlled by a mechanical governor, consisting of weights rotating at engine speed constrained by springs and a lever.  The injectors are held open by the fuel pressure. On high-speed engines the plunger pumps are together in one unit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstdiesel.com |title=Diesel injection pumps, Diesel injectors, Diesel fuel pumps, turbochargers, Diesel trucks all at First Diesel Injection LTD |publisher=Firstdiesel.com |date= |accessdate=May 11, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uL1K4pRJ?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.firstdiesel.com |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref> The length of fuel lines from the pump to each injector is normally the same for each cylinder in order to obtain the same pressure delay.\n\nA cheaper configuration on high-speed engines with fewer than six cylinders is to use an axial-piston distributor pump, consisting of one rotating pump plunger delivering fuel to a valve and line for each cylinder (functionally analogous to points and distributor cap on an [[Otto engine]]).<ref name=buckman/>\n\nMany modern systems have a single fuel pump which supplies fuel constantly at high pressure with a [[common rail]] (single fuel line common) to each injector. Each injector has a [[solenoid]] operated by an electronic control unit, resulting in more accurate control of injector opening times that depend on other control conditions, such as engine speed and loading, and providing better engine performance and fuel economy.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nBoth mechanical and electronic injection systems can be used in either [[Direct fuel injection|direct]] or [[indirect injection]] configurations.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n[[Two-stroke engine|Two-stroke]] diesel engines with mechanical injection pumps can be inadvertently run in reverse, albeit in a very inefficient manner, possibly damaging the engine.<ref>http://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/engines-equipment/two-stroke6.htm</ref>\nLarge ship [[Two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] diesels are designed to run in either direction, obviating the need for a gearbox.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n===Indirect injection===\n[[File:Ricardo comet combustion.gif|thumb|Ricardo Comet indirect injection chamber]]\n{{Main article|Indirect injection}}\nAn indirect Diesel injection system (IDI) engine delivers fuel into a small chamber called a swirl chamber, pre combustion chamber, pre chamber or ante-chamber, which is connected to the cylinder by a narrow air passage. Generally the goal of the pre camber is to create increased [[turbulence]] for better air / fuel mixing. This system also allows for a smoother, quieter running engine, and because fuel mixing is assisted by turbulence, [[injector]] pressures can be lower.  Most IDI systems tend to use a single orifice injector.  The pre-chamber has the disadvantage of lowering efficiency due to increased heat loss to the engine's cooling system, restricting the combustion burn, thus reducing the efficiency by 5\u201310%.. IDI engines are also  more difficult to start and usually require the use of glow plugs. IDI engines may be cheaper to build but generally require a higher compression ratio than the DI counterpart. IDI also makes it easier to produce smooth, quieter running engines with a simple mechanical injection system since exact injection timing is not as critical. Most modern automotive engines are DI which have the benefits of greater efficiency, easier starting, however IDI engines can still be found in the many ATV and small Diesel applications.<ref>[http://www.dieselhub.com/tech/idi-vs-di.html \"IDI vs DI\"] Diesel hub</ref>\n\n===Direct injection===\n[[File:T\u00eates de piston.svg|thumb|Different types of piston bowls]]\n[[Direct fuel injection|Direct injection]] diesel engines inject fuel directly into the cylinder. Usually there is a combustion cup in the top of the piston where the fuel is sprayed. Many different methods of injection can be used.\n  \nElectronic control of the fuel injection transformed the direct injection engine by allowing much greater control over the combustion.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Diesel Fuel Injection\u2014How-It-Works|journal=Diesel Power|date=June 2007|url=http://www.dieselpowermag.com/tech/general/0706dp_diesel_fuel_injection/viewall.html|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Unit direct injection===\n{{Main article|Unit Injector}}\nUnit direct injection also injects fuel directly into the cylinder of the engine. In this system the injector and the pump are combined into one unit positioned over each cylinder controlled by the camshaft. Each cylinder has its own unit eliminating the high-pressure fuel lines, achieving a more consistent injection. This type of injection system, also developed by Bosch, is used by [[Volkswagen]] AG in cars (where it is called a ''[[Pumpe-D\u00fcse]]-System''\u2014literally ''pump-nozzle system'') and by Mercedes-Benz (\"PLD\") and most major diesel engine manufacturers in large commercial engines ([[MAN SE]], [[Caterpillar Inc.|CAT]], [[Cummins]], [[Detroit Diesel]], [[Electro-Motive Diesel]], [[Volvo]]).

The common rail is a tube that supplies each computer-controlled injector containing a precision-machined nozzle and a plunger driven by a [[solenoid]] or [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] actuator.\n\n===Cold weather problems===\n\n====Starting====\nIn cold weather, high speed diesel engines can be difficult to start because the mass of the cylinder block and cylinder head absorb the heat of compression, preventing ignition due to the higher surface-to-volume ratio. Pre-chambered engines make use of small electric heaters inside the pre-chambers called [[glowplug]]s, while direct-injected engines have these glowplugs in the combustion chamber.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n \nMany engines use resistive heaters in the [[intake manifold]] to warm the inlet air for starting, or until the engine reaches [[operating temperature]]. [[Engine block heater]]s (electric resistive heaters in the engine block) connected to the utility grid are used in cold climates when an engine is turned off for extended periods (more than an hour), to reduce startup time and engine wear. Block heaters are also used for emergency power [[Standby generator|standby Diesel-powered generators]] which must rapidly pick up load on a power failure. In the past, a wider variety of cold-start methods were used. Some engines, such as [[Detroit Diesel]]<ref>The Free Library [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DETROIT+DIESEL+INTRODUCES+DDEC+ETHER+START-a016648399] \"DETROIT DIESEL INTRODUCES DDEC ETHER START\" March 13, 1995, accessed March 14, 2011.</ref> engines used{{When|date=September 2010}} a system to introduce small amounts of [[ether]] into the inlet manifold to start combustion. Others used a mixed system, with a resistive heater burning [[methanol]]. An impromptu method, particularly on out-of-tune engines, is to manually spray an aerosol can of ether-based engine starter fluid into the intake air stream (usually through the intake air filter assembly).\n\n====Gelling====\nDiesel fuel is also prone to ''waxing'' or ''gelling'' in cold weather; both are terms for the solidification of diesel oil into a partially crystalline state. The crystals build up in the fuel line (especially in fuel filters), eventually starving the engine of fuel and causing it to stop running. Low-output electric heaters in [[fuel tank]]s and around fuel lines are used to solve this problem. Also, most engines have a ''spill return'' system, by which any excess fuel from the injector pump and injectors is returned to the fuel tank. Once the engine has warmed, returning warm fuel prevents waxing in the tank.\n\nDue to improvements in fuel technology with additives, waxing rarely occurs in all but the coldest weather when a mix of diesel and [[kerosene]] may be used to run a vehicle. Gas stations in regions with a cold climate are required to offer [[winter diesel fuel|winterized diesel]] in the cold seasons that allow operation below a specific [[cold filter plugging point|Cold Filter Plugging Point]]. In Europe these diesel characteristics are described in the [[EN 590]] standard.\n\n===Supercharging and turbocharging===\nMany diesels are now [[turbocharging|turbocharged]] and some are both turbo charged and [[supercharged]].  A turbocharged engine can produce  more power than a naturally aspirated engine of the same configuration.  A supercharger is powered mechanically by the engine's [[crankshaft]], while a turbocharger is powered by the engine exhaust. Turbocharging can improve the fuel economy<ref>Heywood Internal Combustion Engine Fundamentals Figure 15\u201340 shows better, and much bigger, efficiency of turbo engine versus NA version</ref> of diesel engines by recovering waste heat from the exhaust, increasing the excess air factor, and increasing the ratio of engine output to friction losses.\n\n{{anchor|Scavenge blower}}A [[two-stroke engine]] does not have a discrete exhaust and intake stroke and thus is incapable of self-aspiration. Therefore, all two-stroke engines must be fitted with a [[scavenge blower|blower]] or some form of compressor to charge the cylinders with air and assist in dispersing exhaust gases, a process referred to as [[scavenging (automotive)|scavenging]]. In some cases, the engine may also be fitted with a turbocharger, whose output is directed into the blower inlet.\n\nA few designs employ a hybrid blower / turbocharger (a turbo-compressor system) for scavenging and charging the cylinders, which device is mechanically driven at cranking and low speeds to act as a blower, but which acts as a true turbocharger at higher speeds and loads. A hybrid turbocharger can revert to compressor mode during commands for large increases in engine output power.\n\nAs turbocharged or supercharged engines produce more power for a given engine size as compared to naturally aspirated engines, attention must be paid to the mechanical design of components, lubrication, and cooling to handle the power. Pistons are usually cooled with lubrication oil sprayed on the bottom of the piston. Large \"Low speed\" engines may use water, sea water, or oil supplied through [[telescoping (mechanics)|telescoping]] pipes attached to the crosshead to cool the pistons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.machineryspaces.com/various-piston-cooling-methods.html |title=Piston cooling methods&nbsp;\u2013 Advantage and disadvantages of water cooled and oil cooled pistons |publisher=Machinery spaces |accessdate=November 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Size groups===\n[[File:Diesel engine (PSF).png|thumb|Two Cycle Diesel engine with [[Roots blower]], typical of [[Detroit Diesel]] and some [[Electro-Motive Diesel]] Engines]]\nThere are three size groups of Diesel engines<ref name=\"Brit2and4\">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/162716/diesel-engine/45706/Two-stroke-and-four-stroke-engines \"Two and Four Stroke Diesel Engines\"].

In his examination of the engine, it was noted that the Diesel at that time operated at thermodynamic efficiencies of 27%, while a typical expansion steam engine would operate at about 7-10%.<ref>[http://www.deutsches-museum.de/en/collections/machines/power-engines/combustion-engines/diesel-engines/the-first-diesel-engine-1897/ deutsches museum]</ref>\n\nIn the early decades of the 20th century, when large diesel engines were first being used, the engines took a form similar to the compound steam engines common at the time, with the piston being connected to the connecting rod by a [[crosshead bearing]]. Following steam engine practice some manufacturers made double-acting\ntwo-stroke and four-stroke diesel engines to increase power output, with combustion taking place on both sides of the piston, with two sets of valve gear and fuel injection. While it produced large amounts of power, the double-acting diesel engine's main problem was producing a good seal where the piston rod passed through the bottom of the lower combustion chamber to the crosshead bearing, and no more were built. By the 1930s turbochargers were fitted to some engines. Crosshead bearings are still used to reduce the wear on the cylinders in large long-stroke main marine engines.\n\n===Modern high and medium-speed engines===\n[[File:Yanmar 2GM20.JPG|thumb|A [[Yanmar 2GM20]] marine diesel engine, installed in a [[sailboat]]]]\nAs with petrol engines, there are two classes of diesel engines in current use: two-stroke and four-stroke. The four-stroke type is the \"classic\" version, tracing its lineage back to Rudolf Diesel's [[prototype]]. It is also the most commonly used form, being the preferred power source for many motor vehicles, especially buses and trucks. Much larger engines, such as used for [[Diesel locomotive|railroad locomotion]] and [[marine propulsion]], are often two-stroke units, offering a more favourable [[power-to-weight ratio]], as well as better fuel economy. The most powerful engines in the world are two-stroke diesels of mammoth dimensions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amusingplanet.com/2013/03/the-largest-and-most-powerful-diesel.html |title=The Largest And Most Powerful Diesel Engine in The World |publisher=Amusing Planet |date=March 21, 2013 |accessdate=March 29, 2014 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6OQow7Bex?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amusingplanet.com%2F2013%2F03%2Fthe-largest-and-most-powerful-diesel.html |archivedate=March 29, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n[[Two-stroke diesel engine]] operation is similar to that of petrol counterparts, except that fuel is not mixed with air before induction, and the crankcase does not take an active role in the cycle. The traditional two-stroke design relies upon a mechanically driven [[Roots blower|positive displacement blower]] to charge the cylinders with air before compression and ignition. The charging process also assists in expelling (scavenging) [[combustion]] gases remaining from the previous power stroke.\n\nThe [[archetype]] of the modern form of the two-stroke diesel is the (high-speed) [[Detroit Diesel Series 71]] engine, designed by [[Charles F. Kettering|Charles F. \"Boss\" Kettering]] and his colleagues at [[General Motors|General Motors Corporation]] in 1938, in which the blower pressurizes a chamber in the engine block that is often referred to as the \"air box\".

The inline-six-cylinder design is the most prolific in light- to medium-duty engines, though small V8 and larger inline-four displacement engines are also common. Small-capacity engines (generally considered to be those below five litres in capacity) are generally four- or six-cylinder types, with the four-cylinder being the most common type found in automotive uses. Five-cylinder diesel engines have also been produced, being a compromise between the smooth running of the six-cylinder and the space-efficient dimensions of the four-cylinder. Diesel engines for smaller plant machinery, boats, tractors, generators and pumps may be four, three or two-cylinder types, with the single-cylinder diesel engine remaining for light stationary work. Direct reversible two-stroke marine diesels need at least three cylinders for reliable restarting forwards and reverse, while four-stroke diesels need at least six cylinders.\n\nThe desire to improve the diesel engine's [[power-to-weight]] ratio produced several novel cylinder arrangements to extract more power from a given capacity. The uniflow [[opposed-piston engine]] uses two pistons in one cylinder with the combustion cavity in the middle and gas in- and outlets at the ends. This makes a comparatively light, powerful, swiftly running and economic engine suitable for use in aviation. An example is the [[Junkers Jumo 204|Junkers Jumo 204/205]]. The [[Napier Deltic]] engine, with three cylinders arranged in a triangular formation, each containing two opposed pistons, the whole engine having three crankshafts, is one of the better known.\n\n===Gas generator===\n{{Main article|Free-piston engine}}\nBefore 1950, [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer]] started experimenting with two-stroke engines with boost pressures as high as 6 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]], in which all the output power was taken from an exhaust [[gas turbine]]. The two-stroke pistons directly drove air compressor pistons to make a positive displacement gas generator. Opposed pistons were connected by linkages instead of crankshafts. Several of these units could be connected to provide power gas to one large output turbine. The overall thermal efficiency was roughly twice that of a simple gas turbine.<ref>''Modern High-Speed Oil Engines, Volume II'' by C. W. Chapman, published by The Caxton Publishing Co. Ltd.

For example, the current model [[\u0160koda Octavia]], using [[Volkswagen Group]] engines, has a combined Euro rating of {{convert|6.2|L/100km|abbr=on}} for the {{convert|102|bhp|abbr=on|adj=on|lk=in}} petrol engine and {{convert|4.4|L/100km|abbr=on}} for the {{convert|105|bhp|adj=on|abbr=on}} diesel engine.\n\nHowever, such a comparison does not take into account that diesel fuel is denser and contains about 15% more energy by volume. Although the [[Heat of combustion|calorific value]] of the fuel is slightly lower at 45.3&nbsp;MJ/kg ([[joule|megajoules]] per kilogram) than petrol at 45.8&nbsp;MJ/kg, liquid diesel fuel is significantly denser than liquid petrol. This is significant because volume of fuel, in addition to mass, is an important consideration in mobile applications.\n\nAdjusting the numbers to account for the energy density of diesel fuel, the overall energy efficiency is still about 20% greater for the diesel version.\n\nWhile a higher compression ratio is helpful in raising efficiency, diesel engines are much more efficient than gasoline (petrol) engines when at low power and at engine idle. Unlike the petrol engine, diesels lack a butterfly valve (throttle) in the inlet system, which closes at idle. This creates parasitic loss and destruction of availability of the incoming air, reducing the efficiency of petrol engines at idle. In many applications, such as marine, agriculture, and railways, diesels are left idling and unattended for many hours, sometimes even days. These advantages are especially attractive in locomotives (see [[dieselisation]]).\n\nEven though diesel engines have a theoretical fuel efficiency of 75%,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} in practice it is lower. Engines in large diesel trucks, buses, and newer diesel cars can achieve peak efficiencies around 45%,<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.epa.gov/otaq/models/ngm/may04/crc0304c.pdf | title = Medium and Heavy Duty Diesel Vehicle Modeling Using a Fuel Consumption Methodology | format= PDF | year = 2004 | publisher = US EPA}}</ref> and could reach 55% efficiency in the near future.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.epa.gov/midwestcleandiesel/publications/presentations/il-finance-09-06/eberhardt.pdf | archiveurl = http://www.neotrucks.com/pdf/eberhardt.pdf | archivedate = March 27, 2009| title = Motivations for Promoting Clean Diesels | format= PDF | year = 2006 | publisher = US Department of Energy}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref> However, average efficiency over a driving cycle is lower than peak efficiency. For example, it might be 37% for an engine with a peak efficiency of 44%.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FZX/is_4_66/ai_62371160/print?tag=artBody;col1 | title = The Challenge Of CVTs In Current Heavy-Duty Powertrains |date=April 2000 | journal = Diesel Progress North American Edition | author = Michael Soimar}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Torque===\nDiesel engines produce more torque than petrol engines for a given displacement due to their higher compression ratio. Higher pressure in the cylinder and higher forces on the connecting rods and crankshaft require stronger, heavier components. Heavier rotating components prevent diesel engines from revving as high as petrol engines for a given displacement. Diesel engines generally have similar power and inferior power to weight ratios as compared to petrol engines. Petrol engines must be geared lower to get the same torque as a comparable diesel but since petrol engines rev higher both will have similar acceleration. An arbitrary amount of torque at the wheels can be gained by gearing any power source down sufficiently (including a hand crank). For example, a theoretical engine with a constant 200&nbsp;ft.lbs of torque and a 3000 rpm rev limit has just as much [[Power (physics)|power]] (a little over 114&nbsp;hp) as another theoretical engine with a constant maximum 100&nbsp;ft.lbs of torque and a 6000 rpm rev limit. A (lossless) 2 to 1 reduction gear on the second engine will output a constant maximum 200&nbsp;ft.lbs of torque at a maximum of 3000 rpm, with no change in power. Comparing engines based on (maximum) torque is just as useful as comparing them based on (maximum) rpm.\n\n===Power===\nConditions in the diesel engine differ from the spark-ignition engine due to the different thermodynamic cycle. In addition the power and engine speed are directly controlled by the fuel supply, rather than by controlling the air supply as in an [[otto cycle engine]].\n\nThe average diesel engine has a poorer power-to-weight ratio than the [[petrol engine]]. This is because the diesel must operate at lower engine speeds due to the need for heavier, stronger parts to resist the operating pressure caused by the high compression ratio of the engine, which increases the forces on the parts due to inertial forces.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.perkins.com/cda/components/fullArticleNoNav?ids=284124&languageId=7\n| title = Engine Genetics\n| year = 2006\n| publisher = Perkins Engines Company Limited}}</ref>  In addition, diesels are often built with stronger parts to give them longer lives and better reliability, important considerations in industrial applications.{{questionable|date=June 2016}}\n\nDiesel engines usually have longer stroke lengths chiefly to facilitate achieving the necessary compression ratios. As a result, piston and connecting rods are heavier and more force must be transmitted through the connecting rods and crankshaft to change the momentum of the piston. This is another reason that a diesel engine must be stronger for the same power output as a petrol engine.\n\nYet it is this characteristic that has allowed some enthusiasts to acquire significant power increases with [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] engines by making fairly simple and inexpensive modifications. A petrol engine of similar size cannot put out a comparable power increase without extensive alterations because the stock components cannot withstand the higher stresses placed upon them. Since a diesel engine is already built to withstand higher levels of stress, it makes an ideal candidate for [[Engine tuning|performance tuning]] at little expense. However, it should be said that any modification that raises the amount of fuel and air put through a diesel engine will increase its operating temperature, which will reduce its life and increase service requirements. These are issues with newer, lighter, ''high-performance'' diesel engines which are not \"overbuilt\" to the degree of older engines and they are being pushed to provide greater power in smaller engines.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n===Emissions===\n{{main article|Diesel exhaust}}\nSince the diesel engine uses less fuel than the petrol engine per unit distance, the diesel produces less [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) per unit distance. Recent advances in production and changes in the political climate have increased the availability and awareness of [[biodiesel]], an alternative to petroleum-derived diesel fuel with a much lower net-sum emission of CO<sub>2</sub>, due to the absorption of CO<sub>2</sub> by plants used to produce the fuel. However, the use of waste vegetable oil, sawmill waste from managed forests in Finland, and advances in the production of vegetable oil from algae demonstrate great promise in providing feed stocks for sustainable biodiesel that are not in competition with food production.\n\nWhen a diesel engine runs at low power, there is enough oxygen present to burn the fuel\u2014diesel engines only make significant amounts of [[carbon monoxide]] when running under a load.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nDiesel fuel is injected just before the power stroke. As a result, the fuel cannot burn completely unless it has a sufficient amount of oxygen. This can result in incomplete combustion and black smoke in the exhaust if more fuel is injected than there is air available for the combustion process. Modern engines with electronic fuel delivery can adjust the timing and amount of fuel delivered, and so operate with less waste of fuel. In a mechanical system fuel timing system, the injection and duration must be set to be efficient at the anticipated operating rpm and load, and so the settings are less than ideal when the engine is running at any other RPM. The electronic injection can \"sense\" engine revs, load, even boost and temperature, and continuously alter the timing to match the given situation. In the petrol engine, air and fuel are mixed for the entire compression stroke, ensuring complete mixing even at higher engine speeds.\n\nDiesel exhaust is well known for its characteristic smell, but this smell in recent years has become much less due to use of low [[sulfur]] fuel.\n\nDiesel [[Exhaust gas#Diesel engines|exhaust]] has been found to contain a [[Diesel Exhaust Toxic Air Contaminants|long list of toxic air contaminants]]. Among these pollutants, [[Diesel particulate matter|fine particle pollution]] is an important as a cause of [[Diesel exhaust#Health effects|diesel's harmful health effects]]. However, when diesel engines burn their fuel with high oxygen levels, this results in high combustion temperatures and higher efficiency, and these particles tend to burn, but the amount of {{NOx}} pollution tends to increase.\n\n{{NOx}} pollution can be reduced with [[diesel exhaust fluid]], which is injected into the exhaust stream, and catalytically destroys the {{NOx}} chemical species. [[Exhaust gas recirculation]] which works by recirculating a portion of an engine's exhaust gas back to the engine cylinders also has very positive effects on {{NOx}} emissions.\n\n===Noise===\nThe distinctive noise of a diesel engine is variably called diesel clatter, diesel nailing, or diesel knock.<ref name=\"Comb in IC\">{{Cite journal\n| title = Combustion in IC (Internal Combustion) Engines\n| accessdate = November 1, 2008\n| url = http://me.queensu.ca/courses/MECH435/6.+Combustion+in+IC+Engines.ppt\n| pages = Slide 37\n}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Diesel clatter is caused largely by the diesel combustion process; the sudden ignition of the diesel fuel when injected into the combustion chamber causes a pressure wave. Engine designers can reduce diesel clatter through: indirect injection; pilot or pre-injection; injection timing; injection rate; compression ratio; turbo boost; and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR).<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Engine & fuel engineering\u2014Diesel Noise\n| accessdate = November 1, 2008\n| url = http://www.eng-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=139341&page=7\n}}</ref> Common rail diesel injection systems permit multiple injection events as an aid to noise reduction. Diesel fuels with a higher octane rating modify the combustion process and reduce diesel clatter.<ref name=\"Comb in IC\" /> CN ([[Cetane number]]) can be raised by distilling higher quality crude oil, by catalyzing a higher quality product or by using a cetane improving additive.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nA combination of improved mechanical technology such as multi-stage injectors which fire a short \"pilot charge\" of fuel into the cylinder to initiate combustion before delivering the main fuel charge, higher injection pressures that have improved the atomisation of fuel into smaller droplets, and electronic control (which can adjust the timing and length of the injection process to optimise it for all speeds and temperatures), have partially mitigated these problems in the latest generation of common-rail designs, while improving engine efficiency.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n===Reliability===\nFor most industrial or nautical applications, reliability is considered more important than light weight and high power.\n\nThe lack of an electrical [[ignition system]] greatly improves the reliability. The high durability of a diesel engine is also due to its overbuilt nature (see above). Diesel fuel is a better lubricant than petrol and thus, it is less harmful to the oil film on [[piston ring]]s and [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] bores as occurs in petro powered engines; it is routine for diesel engines to cover {{convert|400000|km|abbr=on}} or more without a rebuild.\n\nDue to the greater compression ratio and the increased weight of the stronger components, starting a diesel engine is harder than starting a gasoline engine of similar design and displacement. More [[torque]] from the starter motor is required to push the engine through the compression cycle when starting compared to a petrol engine. This can cause difficulty when starting in winter time if using conventional automotive batteries because of the lower current available.\n\nEither an electrical [[Automobile self starter|starter]] or an [[air-start system]] is used to start the engine turning. On large engines, pre-[[lubrication]] and slow turning of an engine, as well as heating, are required to minimise the amount of engine damage during initial start-up and running. Some smaller military diesels can be started with an explosive cartridge, called a [[Coffman engine starter|Coffman starter]], which provides the extra power required to get the machine turning. In the past, [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] and [[Deere & Company|John Deere]] used a small petrol ''pony'' engine in their tractors to start the primary diesel engine. The pony engine heated the diesel to aid in ignition and used a small clutch and transmission to spin up the diesel engine. Even more unusual was an [[International Harvester]] design in which the diesel engine had its own carburetor and ignition system, and started on petrol. Once warmed, the operator moved two levers to switch the engine to diesel operation, and work could begin. These engines had very complex cylinder heads, with their own petrol combustion chambers, and were vulnerable to expensive damage if special care was not taken (especially in letting the engine cool before turning it off).{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n===Cylinder cavitation and erosion damage===\nOne phenomenon that can affect water-cooled diesel engines is cylinder cavitation and erosion.  This is due to a phenomenon in high-compression engines where the ignition of the fuel in the cylinder causes a high-frequency vibration that causes bubbles to form in the coolant in contact with the cylinder.  When these tiny bubbles collapse, coolant impacts the cylinder wall, over time causing small holes to form in the cylinder wall.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Investigation Of Cavitation Erosion In Diesel Engine Coolant Systems At The U. S. Naval Engineering Experiment Station\n| accessdate = July 28, 2015\n| url = http://papers.sae.org/560240/\n}}</ref> This damage is mitigated in some engines with coatings, or with a coolant additive specifically designed to prevent cavitation and erosion damage.  Engines damaged in this way will require the affected cylinder to be repaired (where possible) or will be rendered unusable.\n\n===Quality and variety of fuels===\nPetrol/gasoline engines are limited in the variety and quality of the fuels they can burn. Older petrol engines fitted with a [[carburetor]] required a volatile fuel that would vaporise easily to create the necessary [[air-fuel ratio]] for combustion. Because both air and fuel are admitted to the cylinder, if the [[compression ratio]] of the engine is too high or the fuel too volatile (with too low an [[octane]] rating), the fuel will ignite under compression, as in a diesel engine, before the piston reaches the top of its stroke. This pre-ignition causes a power loss and over time major damage to the piston and cylinder. The need for a fuel that is volatile enough to vaporise but not too volatile (to avoid pre-ignition) means that petrol engines will only run on a narrow range of fuels. There has been some success at dual-fuel engines that use petrol and [[ethanol]], petrol and [[propane]], and petrol and [[methane]].\n\nIn diesel engines, a mechanical injector system vaporizes the fuel directly into the combustion chamber or a pre-combustion chamber (as opposed to a [[Aspirator (pump)|Venturi jet]] in a carburetor, or a [[Fuel injection|fuel injector]] in a fuel injection system vaporising fuel into the intake manifold or intake runners as in a petrol engine). This ''forced vaporisation'' means that less-volatile fuels can be used. More crucially, because only air is inducted into the cylinder in a diesel engine, the compression ratio can be much higher as there is no risk of pre-ignition provided the injection process is accurately timed. This means that cylinder temperatures are much higher in a diesel engine than a petrol engine, allowing less volatile fuels to be used.\n\nDiesel fuel is a form of light fuel oil, very similar to [[kerosene]] (paraffin), but diesel engines, especially older or simple designs that lack precision electronic injection systems, can run on a wide variety of other fuels. Some of the most common alternatives are Jet A-1 type [[jet fuel]] or [[vegetable oil]] from a very wide variety of plants. Some engines can be run on vegetable oil without modification, and most others require fairly basic alterations. [[Biodiesel]] is a pure diesel-like fuel refined from vegetable oil and can be used in nearly all diesel engines. Requirements for fuels to be used in diesel engines are the ability of the fuel to flow along the fuel lines, the ability of the fuel to lubricate the injector pump and injectors adequately, and its ignition qualities (ignition delay, [[cetane number]]). Inline mechanical injector pumps generally tolerate poor-quality or bio-fuels better than distributor-type pumps. Also, indirect injection engines generally run more satisfactorily on bio-fuels than direct injection engines. This is partly because an indirect injection engine has a much greater 'swirl' effect, improving vaporisation and combustion of fuel, and because (in the case of vegetable oil-type fuels) [[lipid]] depositions can condense on the cylinder walls of a direct-injection engine if combustion temperatures are too low (such as starting the engine from cold).\n\nIt is often reported that Diesel designed his engine to run on [[peanut oil]], but this is false. Patent number 608845 describes his engine as being designed to run on pulverulent solid fuel ([[coal dust]]). Diesel stated in his published papers, \"at the Paris Exhibition in 1900 (''[[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]]'') there was shown by the Otto Company a small diesel engine, which, at the request of the French Government ran on [[Arachis|Arachide]] (earth-nut or peanut) oil (see [[biodiesel]]), and worked so smoothly that only a few people were aware of it.  The engine was constructed for using [[mineral oil]], and was then worked on vegetable oil without any alterations being made.  The French Government at the time thought of testing the applicability to power production of the Arachide, or earth-nut, which grows in considerable quantities in their African colonies, and can easily be cultivated there.\" Diesel himself later conducted related tests and appeared supportive of the idea.<ref>The Biodiesel Handbook, Chapter 2\u2014The History of Vegetable Oil Based Diesel Fuels, by Gerhard Knothe, ISBN 978-1-893997-79-0</ref>\n\nMost large marine diesels run on heavy [[fuel oil]] (sometimes called \"bunker oil\"), which is a thick, viscous and almost flameproof fuel which is very safe to store and cheap to buy in bulk as it is a waste product from the petroleum refining industry. The fuel must not only be pre-heated, but must be kept heated during handling and storage in order to maintain its pumpability. This is usually accomplished by steam tracing on fuel lines and steam coils in fuel oil tanks. The fuel is then preheated to over 100C before entering the engine in order to attain the proper viscosity for atomisation.\n\n==Fuel and fluid characteristics==\n{{Main article|Diesel fuel}}\nDiesel engines can operate on a variety of different fuels, depending on configuration, though the eponymous [[diesel fuel]] derived from [[crude oil]] is most common. The engines can work with the full spectrum of crude oil distillates, from natural gas, alcohols, petrol, [[wood gas]] to the ''fuel oils'' from diesel oil to residual fuels. Many automotive diesel engines would run on 100% biodiesel without any modifications.\n\nThe type of fuel used is selected to meet a combination of service requirements, and fuel costs. Good-quality diesel fuel can be synthesised from [[vegetable oil]] and alcohol. Diesel fuel can be made from coal or other carbon base using the [[Fischer\u2013Tropsch process]]. [[Biodiesel]] is growing in popularity since it can frequently be used in unmodified engines, though production remains limited. Recently, biodiesel from coconut, which can produce a very promising coco methyl ester (CME), has characteristics which enhance lubricity and combustion giving a regular diesel engine without any modification more power, less particulate matter or black smoke, and smoother engine performance. The Philippines pioneers in the research on Coconut based CME with the help of German and American scientists. Petroleum-derived diesel is often called ''petrodiesel'' if there is need to distinguish the source of the fuel.\n\n[[Vegetable oil used as fuel|Pure plant oils]] are increasingly being used as a fuel for cars, trucks and remote [[combined heat and power]] generation especially in Germany where hundreds of decentralised small- and medium-sized oil presses cold press oilseed, mainly [[rapeseed]], for fuel. There is a [[Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung]] fuel standard for rapeseed oil fuel.\n\n''Residual fuels'' are the \"dregs\" of the distillation process and are a thicker, heavier oil, or oil with higher [[viscosity]], which are so thick that they are not readily pumpable unless heated. Residual fuel oils are cheaper than clean, refined diesel oil, although they are dirtier. Their main considerations are for use in ships and very large generation sets, due to the cost of the large volume of fuel consumed, frequently amounting to many tonnes per hour. The poorly refined [[biofuel]]s [[straight vegetable oil]] (SVO) and [[waste vegetable oil]] (WVO) can fall into this category, but can be viable fuels on non-common rail or TDI PD diesels with the simple conversion of fuel heating to 80 to 100 degrees Celsius to reduce viscosity, and adequate filtration to OEM standards. Engines using these heavy oils have to start and shut down on standard diesel fuel, as these fuels will not flow through fuel lines at low temperatures. Moving beyond that, use of low-grade fuels can lead to serious maintenance problems because of their high sulphur and lower lubrication properties. Most diesel engines that power ships like supertankers are built so that the engine can safely use low-grade fuels due to their separate cylinder and crankcase lubrication.\n\nNormal diesel fuel is more difficult to ignite and slower in developing fire than petrol because of its higher [[flash point]], but once burning, a diesel fire can be fierce.\n\nFuel contaminants such as dirt and water are often more problematic in diesel engines than in petrol engines. Water can cause serious damage, due to corrosion, to the injection pump and injectors; and dirt, even very fine particulate matter, can damage the injection pumps due to the close tolerances that the pumps are machined to. All diesel engines will have a fuel filter (usually much finer than a filter on a petrol engine), and a water trap. The water trap (which is sometimes part of the fuel filter) often has a float connected to a warning light, which warns when there is too much water in the trap, and must be drained before damage to the engine can result. The fuel filter must be replaced much more often on a diesel engine than on a petrol engine, changing the fuel filter every 2\u20134 oil changes is not uncommon for some vehicles.\n\n==Safety==\n\n===Fuel flammability===\nDiesel fuel is less [[flammability|flammable]] than petrol, leading to a lower risk of fire caused by fuel in a vehicle equipped with a diesel engine.\n\nIn [[yacht]]s, diesel engines are often used because the petrol (gasoline) that fuels spark-ignition engines releases combustible vapors which can lead to an explosion if it accumulates in a confined space such as the bottom of a vessel. Ventilation systems are mandatory on petrol-powered vessels.<ref>[[Yacht Safety Bureau]] The Yacht Safety Bureau, Inc.in the State of New York</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Army]] and [[NATO]] use only diesel engines and turbines because of fire hazard. Although neither gasoline nor diesel is explosive in liquid form, both can create an explosive air/vapor mix under the right conditions. However, diesel fuel is less prone due to its lower [[vapor pressure]], which is an indication of evaporation rate.

Residual pressure can remain in the fuel lines long after an injection-equipped engine has been shut down. This residual pressure must be relieved, and if it is done so by external bleed-off, the fuel must be safely contained. If a high-pressure diesel fuel injector is removed from its seat and operated in open air, there is a risk to the operator of injury by [[Jet injector#Accidental jet injection|hypodermic jet-injection]], even with only {{convert|100|psi}} pressure.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Agha | first = F.P.\n| title = High-pressure paint gun injuries of hand: clinical and roentgen aspects\n| journal = NY State Journal of Medicine\n| volume = 78\n| pages = 1955\u20131956\n| year = 1978\n}}</ref> The first known such injury occurred in 1937 during a diesel engine maintenance operation.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Rees | first = C.E.\n| title = Penetration of Tissue by Fuel Oil Under High Pressure from a Diesel Engine\n| journal = Journal of the American Medical Association\n| volume = 109\n| pages = 866\u2013867\n| year = 1937\n| doi = 10.1001/jama.1937.92780370004012c\n| issue = 11\n}}</ref>\n\n===Cancer===\n[[Diesel exhaust]] has been classified as an [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|IARC Group 1 carcinogen]].

They were popular in larger cars earlier, as the weight and cost penalties were less noticeable.<ref name=AG125>{{cite journal | ref = AG125 | journal = De AutoGids | number = 125 | volume = 5 | page = 6 | title = Gedetailleerde Test: Citro\u00ebn BX19 TRD | trans_title = Detailed Test | last = Pirotte | first = Marcel | language = Flemish | date = 1984-07-05 | publisher = Uitgeverij Auto-Magazine | location = Brussels, Belgium }}</ref> Diesel engines tend to be more economical at regular driving speeds and are much better at city speeds. Their reliability and life-span tend to be better (as detailed). Some 40 percent or more of all cars sold in Europe are diesel-powered where they are considered a low CO<sub>2</sub> option. [[Mercedes-Benz]] in conjunction with [[Robert Bosch GmbH]] produced diesel-powered passenger cars starting in 1936 and very large numbers are used all over the world (often as \"Grande Taxis\" in the [[Third World]]). Diesel-powered passenger cars are very popular in [[India]] too, since the price of diesel fuel there is lower as compared to petrol. As a result, predominantly petrol-powered car manufacturers including the [[List of automobile manufacturers of Japan|Japanese car manufacturers]] produce and market diesel-powered cars in India. Diesel-powered cars also dominate the Indian taxi industry.\n\n===Railroad rolling stock===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016|small=y}}\nDiesel engines have eclipsed [[steam engine]]s as the prime mover on all non-electrified railroads in the industrialized world. The first [[diesel locomotive]]s appeared in the early 20th century, and [[diesel multiple units]] soon after.  While [[electric locomotive]]s have replaced the [[diesel locomotive]] for some passenger traffic in Europe and Asia, diesel is still today very popular for cargo-hauling [[freight train]]s and on tracks where electrification is not feasible.  Most modern diesel locomotives are actually [[diesel-electric locomotive]]s: the diesel engine is used to power an electric generator that in turn powers electric traction motors with no mechanical connection between diesel engine and traction.  After 2000, environmental requirements has caused higher development cost for engines, and it has become common for passenger [[multiple unit]]s to use engines and automatic mechanical gearboxes made for trucks. Up to four such combinations might be used to achieve enough power in a train.\n\n===Other transport uses===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016|small=y}}\nLarger transport applications ([[truck]]s, [[bus]]es, etc.) also benefit from the Diesel's reliability and high torque output. Diesel displaced paraffin (or [[tractor vaporising oil]], TVO) in most parts of the world by the end of the 1950s with the US following some 20 years later.\n* [[Aircraft Diesel engine|Aircraft]]\n* [[Marine diesel engine#Reciprocating diesel engines|Marine]]\n* [[Diesel motorcycle|Motorcycles]]\n\nIn merchant ships and boats, the same advantages apply with the relative safety of Diesel fuel an additional benefit. The German [[pocket battleship]]s were the largest Diesel warships, but the German torpedo-boats known as [[E-boat]]s (''Schnellboot'') of the Second World War were also Diesel craft. Conventional [[submarine]]s have used them since before World War I, relying on the almost total absence of carbon monoxide in the exhaust. American World War II Diesel-electric submarines operated on two-stroke cycle, as opposed to the four-stroke cycle that other navies used.\n\n===Non-road diesel engines===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016|small=y}}\n[[Non-road diesel engine]]s include mobile equipment and vehicles that are not used on the public roadways such as [[construction equipment]] and agricultural [[tractor]]s.\n\n===Military fuel standardisation===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016|small=y}}\n[[NATO]] has a single vehicle fuel policy and has selected diesel for this purpose. The use of a single fuel simplifies wartime logistics. NATO and the United States Marine Corps have even been developing a diesel military motorcycle based on a [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] off road motorcycle the KLR 650, with a purpose designed naturally aspirated direct injection diesel at [[Cranfield University]] in England, to be produced in the US, because motorcycles were the last remaining gasoline-powered vehicle in their inventory. Before this, a few civilian [[motorcycle]]s had been built using adapted stationary diesel engines, but the weight and cost disadvantages generally outweighed the efficiency gains.\n\n===Non-transport uses===\n[[File:V12 2300HP Power Plant.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1944 V12 2,300&nbsp;kW power plant undergoing testing & restoration]]\nDiesel engines are also used to power [[Diesel generator|permanent]], portable, and backup [[Engine-generator|generators]], irrigation pumps,<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/165217/cost-diesel-pump.pdf \n |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60JYveUSZ?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpi.nsw.gov.au%2F__data%2Fassets%2Fpdf_file%2F0004%2F165217%2Fcost-diesel-pump.pdf \n |archivedate=July 20, 2011 \n |title=Is your diesel pump costing you money? \n |publisher=NSW Department of Primary Industries \n |accessdate=July 12, 2011 \n |deadurl=no \n |df=mdy \n}}</ref> corn grinders,<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.mayaparaiso.com/tortillas.php\n| title = All About Tortillas\n| publisher = Phillip Landmeier\n| year = 2009\n| accessdate = November 26, 2012}}</ref> and coffee de-pulpers.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://practicalaction.org/docs/technical_information_service/coffee.pdf\n| title = Small-Scale Coffee Processing\n| publisher = Practical Action, The Schumacher Center for Technology & Development\n| accessdate = July 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Engine speeds==\nWithin the diesel engine industry, engines are often categorized by their rotational speeds into three unofficial groups:\n* High-speed engines (> 1,000 rpm),\n* Medium-speed engines (300\u20131,000 rpm), and\n* Slow-speed engines (< 300 rpm).\n\nHigh- and medium-speed engines are predominantly four-stroke engines; except for the [[Detroit Diesel]] two-stroke range. Medium-speed engines are physically larger than high-speed engines and can burn lower-grade (slower-burning) fuel than high-speed engines. Slow-speed engines are predominantly large two-stroke crosshead engines, hence very different from high- and medium-speed engines. Due to the lower rotational speed of slow- and medium-speed engines, there is more time for combustion during the power stroke of the cycle, allowing the use of slower-burning fuels than high-speed engines.\n\n===High-speed engines===\nHigh-speed (approximately 1,000&nbsp;rpm and greater) engines are used to power [[truck]]s (lorries), [[bus]]es, [[tractor]]s, [[automobile|cars]], [[yacht]]s, [[Gas compressor|compressors]], [[pump]]s and small [[electrical generator]]s.  As of 2008, most high-speed engines have [[Direct fuel injection|direct injection]]. Many modern engines, particularly in on-highway applications, have [[common rail]] [[Direct fuel injection|direct injection]], which is cleaner burning.\n\n===Medium-speed engines===\nMedium-speed engines are used in large electrical generators, ship propulsion and mechanical drive applications such as large compressors or pumps.  Medium speed diesel engines operate on either diesel fuel or heavy fuel oil by direct injection in the same manner as low-speed engines.\n\nEngines used in electrical generators run at approximately 300 to 1000&nbsp;rpm and are optimized to run at a set [[synchronous speed]] depending on the generation frequency (50 or 60&nbsp;[[hertz]]) and provide a rapid response to load changes. Typical synchronous speeds for modern medium-speed engines are 500/514&nbsp;rpm (50/60&nbsp;Hz), 600&nbsp;rpm (both 50 and 60&nbsp;Hz), 720/750&nbsp;rpm, and 900/1000&nbsp;rpm.\n\nAs of 2009, the largest medium-speed engines in current production have outputs up to approximately {{convert|20|MW|hp|abbr=on}} and are supplied by companies like [[MAN B&W]], [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wartsila.com/ss/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&blobheadername1=Content-Type&blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&blobheadername3=site&blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&blobheadervalue2=attachment%3B+filename%3DWartsila-O-E-W-64-TR.pdf&blobheadervalue3=Wartsila&blobkey=id&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobwhere=1278589866158&ssbinary=true |title=W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 64 Technology Review |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=October 3, 2010}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref> and [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] (who acquired Ulstein Bergen Diesel in 1999). Most medium-speed engines produced are four-stroke machines, however there are some two-stroke medium-speed engines such as by EMD ([[Electro-Motive Diesel]]), and the Fairbanks Morse OP ([[Opposed-piston engine]]) type.\n\nTypical cylinder bore size for medium-speed engines ranges from 20&nbsp;cm to 50&nbsp;cm, and engine configurations typically are offered ranging from in-line 4-cylinder units to V-configuration 20-cylinder units.  Most larger medium-speed engines are started with compressed air direct on pistons, using an air distributor, as opposed to a pneumatic starting motor acting on the flywheel, which tends to be used for smaller engines. There is no definitive engine size cut-off point for this.\n\nIt should also be noted that most major manufacturers of medium-speed engines make [[natural gas]]-fueled versions of their diesel engines, which in fact operate on the [[Otto cycle]], and require spark ignition, typically provided with a spark plug.<ref name=\"DFE LNG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thedigitalship.com/powerpoints/SMM06/lng/Barend%20Thijssen,%20wartsila.pdf |title=Dual-fuel-electric LNG carriers |format=PDF |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uL1LOLWS?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedigitalship.com%2Fpowerpoints%2FSMM06%2Flng%2FBarend%2520Thijssen%2C%2520wartsila.pdf |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref>  There are also dual (diesel/natural gas/coal gas) fuel versions of medium and low speed diesel engines using a lean fuel air mixture and a small injection of diesel fuel (so-called \"pilot fuel\") for ignition.

This particular engine is found aboard a 29,000 tonne chemical carrier.]]\nAlso known as ''slow-speed'', or traditionally ''oil engines'', the largest diesel engines are primarily used to power [[ship]]s, although there are a few land-based power generation units as well. These extremely large two-stroke engines have power outputs up to approximately {{convert|85|MW|hp|abbr=on}}, operate in the range from approximately 60 to 200&nbsp;rpm and are up to {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on|-1}} tall, and can weigh over {{convert|2000|ST|t}}. They typically use direct injection running on cheap low-grade heavy fuel, also known as [[Bunker fuel|bunker C]] fuel, which requires heating in the ship for tanking and before injection due to the fuel's high [[viscosity]]. Often, the waste heat recovery steam boilers attached to the engine exhaust ducting generate the heat required for fuel heating. Provided the heavy fuel system is kept warm and circulating, engines can be started and stopped on heavy fuel.\n\nLarge and medium marine engines are started with compressed air directly applied to the pistons. Air is applied to cylinders to start the engine forwards or backwards because they are normally directly connected to the [[propeller]] without clutch or gearbox, and to provide reverse propulsion either the engine must be run backwards or the ship will use an adjustable propeller. At least three cylinders are required with [[two-stroke]] engines and at least six cylinders with [[four-stroke]] engines to provide [[torque]] every 120 degrees.\n\nCompanies such as [[MAN B&W Diesel]], and [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]]  design such large low-speed engines. They are unusually narrow and tall due to the addition of a [[crosshead bearing]]. As of 2007, the [[Straight-14|14-cylinder]] [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4-Sulzer 14RTFLEX96-C]] turbocharged two-stroke diesel engine built by [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] licensee [[Doosan Group|Doosan]] in Korea is the most powerful diesel engine put into service, with a cylinder bore of {{convert|960|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} delivering {{convert|114800|hp|MW||abbr=on}}. It was put into service in September 2006, aboard what was then the world's largest container ship ''[[Emma Maersk]]'' which belongs to the [[A.P. Moller-Maersk Group]]. Typical bore size for low-speed engines ranges from approximately {{convert|35|to|98|cm|in|abbr=on}}. As of 2008, all produced low-speed engines with [[crosshead bearing]]s are in-line configurations; no Vee versions have been produced.\n\nLow-speed diesel engines (as used in ships and other applications where overall engine weight is relatively unimportant) often have a thermal efficiency which exceeds 50%.<ref name=\"bmmWW \"/><ref name=\"mhi\"/>\n\n==Current and future developments==\n{{See also|Diesel car history}}\n\nAs of 2008, many [[common rail]] and unit injection systems already employ new injectors using stacked [[piezoelectric]] wafers in lieu of a solenoid, giving finer control of the injection event.<ref>{{cite web|title=Diesel Fuel Injection |accessdate=September 30, 2008 |url=http://www.denso.com.au/products/aftermarket_automotive_components/diesel_fuel_injection |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923170150/http://www.denso.com.au/products/aftermarket_automotive_components/diesel_fuel_injection |archivedate=September 23, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n[[Variable geometry turbocharger]]s have flexible vanes, which move and let more air into the engine depending on load.

Particularly in the United States, coming tougher emissions regulations present a considerable challenge to diesel engine manufacturers. Ford's [[HyTrans Project]] has developed a system which starts the ignition in 400 ms, saving a significant amount of fuel on city routes, and there are other methods to achieve even more efficient combustion, such as [[HCCI|homogeneous charge compression ignition]], being studied.<ref>Craig Goodfellow; cited in {{cite video\n| people = Neil Beasley\n| title = Engineering at the Cutting Edge\n| medium = documentary television series\n| publisher = [[The Discovery Channel]]\n| location =  |date = 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/08/26/abg-tech-analysis-and-driving-impression-gms-hcci-engine/ |title=ABG Tech analysis and driving impression: GM's HCCI Engine |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uL1RMZAp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.autobloggreen.com%2F2007%2F08%2F26%2Fabg-tech-analysis-and-driving-impression-gms-hcci-engine%2F |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nJapanese and Swedish vehicle manufacturers are also developing diesel engines that run on [[dimethyl ether]] (DME).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.japanfs.org/en/pages/026281.html\n| title=Dimethyl Ether (DME) Fueled Crane Truck Begins World's 1st Public Road Test\n| accessdate = August 8, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.createPage&s_ref=LIFE05ENV/S/000405&area=2&yr=2005&n_proj_id=2841&cfid=445&cftoken=4220c76759470609-A83A94B5-0A11-87E8-C1C9BDFBACBF1FE4&mode=print&menu=false\n| title=DME Vehicle\u2014Demonstration of DeMethyl Ether Vehicle for Sustainable Transport\n| accessdate = August 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSome recent diesel engine models utilize a [[Copper in heat exchangers|copper alloy heat exchanger]] technology ([[CuproBraze]]) to take advantage of benefits in terms of thermal performance, heat transfer efficiency, strength/durability, corrosion resistance, and reduced emissions from higher operating temperatures.\n\n===Low heat rejection engines===\nA special class of experimental prototype internal combustion piston engines has been developed over several decades with the goal of improving efficiency by reducing heat loss.<ref>http://topics.sae.org/adiabatic-engines/papers/</ref> These engines are variously called adiabatic engines; due to better approximation of adiabatic expansion; low heat rejection engines, or high temperature engines.<ref>http://papers.sae.org/930988/</ref> They are generally piston engines with combustion chamber parts lined with ceramic thermal barrier coatings.<ref>http://papers.sae.org/931021/</ref> Some make use of pistons and other parts made of titanium which has a low thermal conductivity<ref>http://papers.sae.org/930985/</ref> and density.
