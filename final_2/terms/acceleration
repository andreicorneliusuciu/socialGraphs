An object's acceleration is the net result of any and all [[force]]s acting on the object, as described by [[Newton's Second Law]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Principles of Mechanics |first=Henry |last=Crew |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC |year=2008 |isbn=0-559-36871-2 |pages=43}}</ref> The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit for acceleration is [[metre per second squared]] {{nowrap|(m s<sup>\u22122</sup>).}} Accelerations are [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantities (they have [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and [[Direction (geometry)|direction]]) and add according to the [[parallelogram law]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Relativity and Common Sense |first=Hermann |last=Bondi |pages=3 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1980 |isbn=0-486-24021-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Physics the Easy Way |pages=27 |first=Robert L. |last=Lehrman |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |year=1998 |isbn=0-7641-0236-2}}</ref>  As a [[Vector space|vector]], the calculated net [[force]] is equal to the product of the object's mass (a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity) and its acceleration.\n\nFor example, when a car starts from a standstill (zero relative velocity) and travels in a straight line at increasing speeds, it is accelerating in the direction of travel. If the car turns, there is an acceleration toward the new direction. In this example, we can call the forward acceleration of the car a \"linear acceleration\", which passengers in the car might experience as a force pushing them back into their seats. When changing direction, we might call this \"non-linear acceleration\", which passengers might experience as a sideways force. If the speed of the car decreases, this is an acceleration in the opposite direction from the direction of the vehicle, sometimes called '''deceleration'''.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Raymond A.

Mathematically, there is no separate formula for deceleration: both are changes in velocity. Each of these accelerations (linear, non-linear, deceleration) might be felt by passengers until their velocity (speed and direction) matches that of the car.\n\n== Definition and properties ==\n[[File:Kinematics.svg|thumb|300px|Kinematic quantities of a classical particle: mass ''m'', position '''r''', velocity '''v''', acceleration '''a'''.]]\n\n===Average acceleration===\n[[File:Acceleration as derivative of velocity along trajectory.svg|right|thumb|Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. At any point on a trajectory, the magnitude of the acceleration is given by the rate of change of velocity in both magnitude and direction at that point.

In the terms of [[calculus]], instantaneous acceleration is the [[derivative]] of the velocity vector with respect to time:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{a} = \\lim_{{\\Delta t}\\to 0} \\frac{\\Delta \\mathbf{v}}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt}</math>\n\n(Here and elsewhere, if [[Rectilinear motion|motion is in a straight line]], [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantities can be substituted by [[Scalar (physics)|scalars]] in the equations.)\n\nIt can be seen that the [[integral]] of the acceleration function {{math|''a''(''t'')}} is the velocity function {{math|''v''(''t'')}}; that is, the area under the curve of an acceleration vs. time ({{math|''a''}} vs. {{math|''t''}}) graph corresponds to velocity.\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{v} =  \\int \\mathbf{a} \\  dt</math>\n\nAs acceleration is defined as the derivative of velocity, {{math|'''v'''}}, with respect to time {{math|''t''}} and velocity is defined as the derivative of position, {{math|'''x'''}}, with respect to time, acceleration can be thought of as the [[second derivative]] of {{math|'''x'''}} with respect to {{math|''t''}}:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{a} =  \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \\frac{d^2\\mathbf{x}}{dt^2}</math>\n\n===Units===\nAcceleration has the [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]] of velocity (L/T) divided by time, i.e. [[length|L]].[[time|T]]<sup>\u22122</sup>. The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of acceleration is the [[metre per second squared]] (m s<sup>\u22122</sup>); or \"metre per second per second\", as the velocity in metres per second changes by the acceleration value, every second.\n\n===Other forms===\nAn object moving in a circular motion&mdash;such as a satellite orbiting the Earth&mdash;is accelerating due to the change of direction of motion, although its speed may be constant. In this case it is said to be undergoing ''centripetal'' (directed towards the center) acceleration.\n\n[[Proper acceleration]], the acceleration of a body relative to a free-fall condition, is measured by an instrument called an [[accelerometer]].\n\nIn [[classical mechanics]], for a body with constant mass, the (vector) acceleration of the body's center of mass is proportional to the net [[force]] vector (i.e. sum of all forces) acting on it ([[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]]):\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a} \\quad \\to \\quad \\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{F}/m</math>\nwhere '''F''' is the net force acting on the body, ''m'' is  the [[mass]] of the body, and '''a''' is the center-of-mass acceleration.

The acceleration of a falling body in the absence of resistances to motion is dependent only on the [[gravitational field]] strength ''[[standard gravity|g]]'' (also called ''acceleration due to gravity''). By [[Newton's Second Law]] the [[force]], ''F'', acting on a body is given by:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{F} = m  \\mathbf{g}</math>\n\nBecause of the simple analytic properties of the case of constant acceleration, there are simple formulas relating the [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]], initial and time-dependent [[velocity|velocities]], and acceleration to the [[time in physics|time elapsed]]:<ref>{{cite book |title=Physics for you: revised national curriculum edition for GCSE |author =Keith Johnson |publisher=Nelson Thornes |year=2001 |edition=4th |page=135 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D4nrQDzq1jkC&pg=PA135&dq=suvat#v=onepage&q=suvat&f=false |isbn=978-0-7487-6236-1}}</ref>\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{s}(t) = \\mathbf{s}_0 + \\mathbf{v}_0 t+ \\tfrac{1}{2} \\mathbf{a}t^2 = \\mathbf{s}_0 + \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_0+\\mathbf{v}(t)}{2}t </math>\n:<math> \\mathbf{v}(t) = \\mathbf{v}_0 + \\mathbf{a} t </math>\n:<math> {v^2}(t) = {v_0}^2 + 2\\mathbf{a \\cdot}[\\mathbf{s}(t)-\\mathbf{s}_0] </math>\n\nwhere\n* <math>t</math> is the elapsed time,\n* <math>\\mathbf{s}_0</math> is the initial displacement from the origin,\n* <math>\\mathbf{s}(t)</math> is the displacement from the origin at time <math>t</math>,\n* <math>\\mathbf{v}_0</math> is the initial velocity,\n* <math>\\mathbf{v}(t)</math> is the velocity at time <math>t</math>, and\n* <math>\\mathbf{a}</math> is the uniform rate of acceleration.\n\nIn particular, the motion can be resolved into two orthogonal parts, one of constant velocity and the other according to the above equations.  As [[Galileo]] showed, the net result is parabolic motion, which describes, e.&nbsp;g., the trajectory of a projectile in a vacuum near the surface of Earth.<ref>{{cite book |title=Understanding physics |author1=David C.

Notice the setup is not restricted to 2d space, but a plane in any higher dimension.}}\n\nUniform [[circular motion]], that is constant speed along a circular path, is an example of a body experiencing acceleration resulting in velocity of a constant magnitude but change of direction. In this case, because the direction of the object's motion is constantly changing, being tangential to the circle, the object's linear [[velocity]] vector also changes, but its speed does not. This acceleration is a radial acceleration since it is always directed toward the centre of the circle and takes the magnitude:\n\n:<math> \\textrm{a} = {{v^2} \\over {r}}</math>\n\nwhere <math>v</math> is the object's linear [[speed]] along the circular path. Equivalently, the radial acceleration vector (<math> \\mathbf {a}</math>) may be calculated from the object's [[angular velocity]] <math>\\omega</math>:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf {a}= {-\\omega^2}  \\mathbf {r} </math>\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{r} </math> is a vector directed from the centre of the circle and equal in magnitude to the radius. The negative shows that the acceleration vector is directed towards the centre of the circle (opposite to the radius).\n\nThe acceleration and the net force acting on a body in uniform circular motion are directed ''toward'' the centre of the circle; that is, it is [[centripetal force|centripetal]]. Whereas the so-called '[[centrifugal force]]' appearing to act outward on the body is really a [[pseudo force]] experienced in the [[frame of reference]] of the body in circular motion, due to the body's [[linear momentum]] at a tangent to the circle.\n\nWith nonuniform circular motion, i.e., the speed along the curved path changes, a transverse acceleration is produced equal to the rate of change of the angular speed around the circle times the radius of the circle. That is,\n\n:<math> a = r \\alpha.</math>\n\nThe transverse (or tangential) acceleration is directed at right angles to the radius vector and takes the sign of the [[angular acceleration]] (<math>\\alpha</math>).\n\n== Relation to relativity ==\n\n===Special relativity===\n{{main article|Special relativity}}\nThe special theory of relativity describes the behavior of objects traveling relative to other objects at speeds approaching that of light in a vacuum. [[Newtonian mechanics]] is exactly revealed to be an approximation to reality, valid to great accuracy at lower speeds. As the relevant speeds increase toward the speed of light, acceleration no longer follows classical equations.\n\nAs speeds approach that of light, the acceleration produced by a given force decreases, becoming infinitesimally small as light speed is approached; an object with mass can approach this speed [[asymptotically]], but never reach it.\n\n===General relativity===\n{{main article|General relativity}}\nUnless the state of motion of an object is known, it is totally impossible to distinguish whether an observed force is due to [[gravity]] or to acceleration\u2014gravity and inertial acceleration have identical effects. [[Albert Einstein]] called this the [[principle of equivalence]], and said that only observers who feel no force at all\u2014including the force of gravity\u2014are justified in concluding that they are not accelerating.<ref>Brian Greene, ''[[The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality]]'', page 67.
