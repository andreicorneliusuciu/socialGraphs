When connected to the cloud, robots can benefit from the powerful computational, storage, and communications resources of modern data centre in the cloud, which can process and share information from various robots or agent (other machines, smart objects, humans, etc.). Humans can also delegate tasks to robots remotely through networks. Cloud computing technologies enable robot systems to be endowed with powerful capability whilst reducing costs through cloud technologies. Thus, it is possible to build lightweight, low cost, smarter robots have intelligent \"brain\" in the cloud. The \"brain\" consists of [[data center]], [[knowledge base]], task planners, [[deep learning]], information processing, environment models, communication support etc.<ref name=RASrobot>{{cite web|title=Cloud Robotics and Automation A special issue of the IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering.|url=http://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/t-ase/special-issues/special-issue-on-cloud-robotics-and-automation|publisher=IEEE|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=RoboEarth|url=http://roboearth.org/cloud_robotics/}}</ref><ref name=kengoldburge>{{cite web|last1=Goldberg|first1=Ken|title=Cloud Robotics and Automation|url=http://goldberg.berkeley.edu/cloud-robotics}}</ref><ref name=\"sites.google.com\">{{cite web|last1=Li|first1=R|title=Cloud Robotics-Enable cloud computing for robots|url=https://sites.google.com/site/ruijiaoli/blogs/page|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Components==\nA cloud for robots potentially has at least six significant components:<ref name=cloudsurvey>{{cite journal|last1=Kehoe|first1=Ben|last2=Patil|first2=Sachin|last3=Abbeel|first3=Pieter|last4=Goldburg|first4=Ken|title=A Survey of Research on Cloud Robotics and Automation|journal=IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING|date=13 September 2014|url=http://goldberg.berkeley.edu/pubs/2015-T-ASE-Cloud-Robotics-Survey.pdf}}</ref>\n\n* Offering a global library of images, maps, and object data, often with geometry and mechanical properties, expert system, knowledge base (i.e. semantic web, data centres)\uff1b\n* Massively-parallel computation on demand for sample-based statistical modelling and motion planning, task planning, multi-robot collaboration, scheduling and coordination of system\uff1b\n* Robot sharing of outcomes, trajectories, and dynamic control policies and robot learning support\uff1b\n* Human sharing of \"open-source\" code, data, and designs for programming, experimentation, and hardware construction\uff1b\n* On-demand human guidance and assistance for evaluation, learning, and error recovery;\n* Augmented [[human\u2013robot interaction]] through various way (Semantics knowledge base, Apple SIRI like service etc.).\n\n== Applications ==\n\n'''Autonomous mobile robots''': [[Google driverless car|Google's self-driving cars]] are cloud robots. The cars use the network to access Google's enormous database of maps and satellite and environment model (like Streetview) and combines it with streaming data from GPS, cameras, and 3D sensors to monitor its own position within centimetres, and with past and current traffic patterns to avoid collisions. Each car can learn something about environments, roads, or driving, or conditions, and it sends the information to the Google cloud, where it can be used to improve the performance of other cars.\n\n'''Cloud medical robots''': a medical cloud (also called a healthcare cluster) consists of various services such as a disease archive, electronic medical records, a patient health management system, practice services, analytics services, clinic solutions, expert systems, etc. A robot can connect to the cloud to provide clinical service to patients, as well as deliver assistance to doctors (e.g. a co-surgery robot).

RoboEarth offers a Cloud Robotics infrastructure. RoboEarth\u2019s World-Wide-Web style database stores knowledge generated by humans \u2013 and robots \u2013 in a machine-readable format.

ROS is a flexible and distributed framework for robot software development. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behaviour across a wide variety of robotic platforms. A library for ROS that is a pure Java implementation, called rosjava, allows Android applications to be developed for robots. Since Android has a booming market and billion users, it would be significant in the field of Cloud Robotics.<ref name=rosjava>{{cite web|title=ROSjava-Cloud Robotics|url=http://docs.rosjava.googlecode.com/hg/rosjava_core/html/index.html|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations of cloud robotics ==\nThough robots can benefit from various advantages of cloud computing, cloud is not the solution to all of robotics.<ref name=roadmap>{{cite web|last1=Robotics-vo|title=A Roadmap for U.S. Robotics From Internet to Robotics 2013 Edition|url=https://robotics-vo.us/sites/default/files/2013%20Robotics%20Roadmap-rs.pdf|website=|accessdate=8 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n* Controlling a robot\u2019s motion which relies heavily on sensors and feedback of controller won\u2019t benefit much from the cloud.\n* Cloud-based applications can get slow or unavailable due to high-latency responses or network hitch. If a robot relies too much on the cloud, a fault in the network could leave it \u201cbrainless.\u201d\n* Tasks that involve real-time execution require on-board processing.\n\n== Challenges ==\nThe research and development of cloud robotics has following potential issues and challenges:<ref name=\"roadmap\"/>\n\n*Scalable parallelisation-grid-based computing, parallelisation schemes scale with the size of automation infrastructure.\n*Effective load balancing: Balancing operations between local and cloud computation.\n*Knowledge bases and representations\n*Collective learning for automation in cloud\n*Infrastructure/Platform or Software as a Service\n*Internet of Things for robotics\n*Integrated and collaborative fault tolerant control\n*Big Data: Data, collected and/or disseminated over large, accessible networks can enable decisions for classification problems or reveal patterns.\n*Wireless communication, Connectivity to the cloud\n*System architectures of robot cloud\n*Open-source, open-access infrastructures\n* Workload Sharing\n* Standards and Protocol\n\n== Risks ==\n\n'''Environmental security''' - The concentration of computing resources and users in a cloud computing environment also represents a concentration of security threats. Because of their size and significance, cloud environments are often targeted by virtual machines and bot malware, brute force attacks, and other attacks.\n\n'''Data privacy and security''' - Hosting confidential data with cloud service providers involves the transfer of a considerable amount of an organisation's control over data security to the provider. For example, every cloud contains a huge information from the clients include personal data. If a household robot is hacked, users could have risk of their personal privacy and security, like house layout, life snapshot, home-view, etc. It may be accessed and leaked to the world around by criminals. Another problems is once a robot is hacked and controlled by someone else, which may put the user in danger.\n\n'''Ethical problems''' - Some ethics of robotics, especially for cloud based robotics must be considered. Since a robot is connected via networks, it has risk to be accessed by other people. If a robot is out of control and carries out illegal activities, who should be responsible for it.\n\n== History ==\nSpecial Issue on Cloud Robotics and Automation- A special issue of the IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, April 2015.<ref name=\"RASrobot\"/>\n\nCloud Robotics-Enable cloud computing for robots.
