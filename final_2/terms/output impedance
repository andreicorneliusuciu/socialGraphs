It is the [[Th\u00e9venin equivalent]] [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] looking back into the output terminals.\n\nIn the case of a [[nonlinear device]], such as a [[transistor]], the term \"output impedance\" usually refers to the effect upon a small-amplitude signal, and will vary with the [[bias point]] of the transistor, that is, with the direct current (DC) and voltage applied to the device.  \n\nThe small-signal impedance at DC (frequency of 0) is the same as the resistive component of the impedance and is termed '''output resistance'''.\n\nNo real device ([[Battery (electricity)|battery]], [[electrical generator|generator]], [[amplifier]]) is a perfect source; each has an internal impedance, though this may have little practical effect, depending on the circuit and the load.\n\nDepending on perspective, this impedance can be modeled as being in series with an ideal [[voltage source]], or in parallel with an ideal [[current source]] (''see'': [[Th\u00e9venin's theorem]], [[Norton's theorem]], [[Series and parallel circuits]]). Both models are equivalent, and one may choose whichever model is most convenient for analysis.\n\nFor example, having a preamplifier with a 100-[[Ohm (unit)|ohm]] output impedance means the output voltage signal appears to be in series with a 100-ohm [[resistor]].\n\n== Measurement ==\nThe source resistance of a purely resistive device can be experimentally determined by increasingly loading the device until the voltage across the load (AC or DC) is one half of the open circuit voltage.  At this point, the load resistance and internal resistance are equal. \n\nIt can more accurately be described by keeping track of the voltage vs current curves for various loads, and calculating the resistance from [[Ohm's law]].  (The internal resistance may not be the same for different types of loading or at different frequencies, especially in devices like chemical batteries.)\n\nThe generalized source impedance for a reactive (inductive or capacitive) source device is more complicated to determine, and is usually measured with specialized instruments, rather than taking many measurements by hand.\n\n== Audio amplifiers ==\n[[Image:Source and load circuit Z.png]]\n\nThe real output impedance (Z<sub>source</sub>) of a [[power amplifier]] is usually less than 0.1&nbsp;\u03a9, but this is rarely specified. Instead it is \"hidden\" within the [[damping factor]] parameter, which is:\n\n:<math>\nDF = \\frac{Z_\\mathrm{load}}{Z_\\mathrm{source}}\n</math>\n\nSolving for ''Z''<sub>source</sub>,\n\n:<math>\nZ_\\mathrm{source} = \\frac{Z_\\mathrm{load}}{DF}\n</math>\n\ngives the small source impedance (output impedance) of the power amplifier.  This can be calculated from the ''Z''<sub>load</sub> of the loudspeaker (typically 2, 4, or 8 ohms) and the given value of the damping factor.\n\nGenerally in audio and [[hifi]], the input impedance of components is several times (technically, more than 10) the output impedance of the device connected to them.  This is called [[impedance bridging]] or voltage bridging.\n\nIn this case, ''Z''<sub>load</sub>>> ''Z''<sub>source</sub>, ''DF'' > 10\n\nIn video, RF, and other systems, impedances of inputs and outputs are the same. This is called [[impedance matching]] or a matched connection.\n\nIn this case, ''Z''<sub>source</sub> = ''Z''<sub>load</sub>, ''DF'' = 1/1 = 1 .\n\nThe actual output impedance for most devices is not the same as the rated output impedance.  A power amplifier may have a rated impedance of 8 ohms, but the actual output impedance will vary depending on circuit conditions. The rated output impedance is the impedance into which the amplifier can deliver its maximum amount of power without failing.\n\n== Batteries ==\n'''[[Internal resistance]]''' is a concept that helps model the electrical consequences of the complex chemical reactions inside a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]].  It is impossible to directly measure the internal resistance of a battery, but it can be calculated from current and voltage data measured from a circuit. When a load is applied to a battery, the internal resistance can be calculated from the following equations:\n\n<math>R_B=\\left( \\frac{Vs}{I} \\right) - R_L</math>\n\nor\n\n<math>R_B=\\left( \\frac{V_S-V}{I} \\right)</math>\n\nwhere\n\n<math>R_B</math> is the internal resistance of the battery\n\n<math>V_S</math> is the battery voltage without a load\n\n<math>V</math> is the battery voltage with a load\n\n<math>R_L</math> is the total resistance of the circuit\n\n<math>I</math> is the total current supplied by the battery\n\nInternal resistance varies with the age of a battery, but for most commercial batteries the internal resistance is on the order of 1&nbsp;ohm.\n\nWhen there is a current through a cell, the measured [[Electromotive force|e.m.f.]] is lower than when there is no current delivered by the cell. The reason for this is that part of the available energy of the cell is used up to drive charges through the cell. This energy wasted by the so-called \"internal resistance\" of that cell. This wasted energy shows up as lost voltage.  Internal resistance is r = (E\u2212V)/I .\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Electrical impedance|Impedance]]\n*[[Input impedance]]\n*[[Nominal impedance]]\n*[[Damping factor]]\n*[[Voltage divider]]\n*[[Early effect#Small-signal model | Early effect small-signal model]]\n*[[Equivalent series resistance]]\n*[[Power gain]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last=Tocci|first=Ronald J.|authorlink=Ronald J.
