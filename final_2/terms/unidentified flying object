Culturally, UFOs are associated with claims of visitation by [[extraterrestrials|extraterrestrial life]] or government-related [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], and have become popular subjects in fiction. UFOs are often [[Identification studies of UFOs|identified]] after their sighting. Sometimes, however, UFOs cannot be identified because of the low quality of evidence related to their sightings.\n\nStories of fantastical celestial apparitions have been told since antiquity, but the term \"UFO\" (or \"UFOB\") was officially created in 1953 by the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) to serve as a catch-all for all such reports. In its initial definition, the USAF stated that a \"UFOB\" was \"any airborne object which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features, does not conform to any presently known aircraft or missile type, or which cannot be positively identified as a familiar object.\"  Accordingly, the term was initially restricted to that fraction of cases which remained unidentified after investigation, as the USAF was interested in potential national security reasons and/or \"technical aspects\" (see [[s:Air Force Regulation 200-2, Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting|Air Force Regulation 200-2]]).\n\nDuring the late 1940s and through the 1950s, UFOs were often referred to popularly as \"[[flying saucer]]s\" or \"flying discs\". The term UFO became more widespread during the 1950s, at first in technical literature, but later in popular use. UFOs garnered considerable interest during the [[Cold War]], an era associated with a heightened concern for national security. Various studies have concluded that the phenomenon does not represent a threat to national security nor does it contain anything worthy of scientific pursuit (e.g., 1951 [[Flying Saucer Working Party]], 1953 [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[Robertson Panel]], USAF [[Project Blue Book]], [[Condon Committee]]).\n\n==Terminology==\nThe [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines a UFO as \"An unidentified flying object; a 'flying saucer'.\" The first published book to use the word was authored by [[Donald Keyhoe|Donald E. Keyhoe]].<ref name=\"Keyhoe1953\">[[#Keyhoe 1953|Keyhoe 1953]]</ref>\n\nThe acronym \"UFO\" was coined by Captain [[Edward J. Ruppelt]], who headed Project Blue Book, then the USAF's official investigation of UFOs. He wrote, \"Obviously the term 'flying saucer' is misleading when applied to objects of every conceivable shape and performance. For this reason the military prefers the more general, if less colorful, name: unidentified flying objects. UFO (pronounced Yoo-foe) for short.\"<ref>[[#Ruppelt|Ruppelt 1956]], Chapter 1: [http://www.nicap.org/rufo/rufo-01.htm \"Project Blue Book and the UFO Story\"]</ref> Other phrases that were used officially and that predate the UFO acronym include \"flying flapjack\", \"flying disc\", \"unexplained flying discs\", \"unidentifiable object\", and \"flying saucer\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vault.fbi.gov/UFO/UFO%20Part%201%20of%2016/view |title=UFO Part 1 of 16 |work=The Vault |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1\u201320 |accessdate=2013-05-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bluebookarchive.org/page.aspx?PageCode=NARA-PBB1-922 |title=Unidentifiable objects, Williams Field; Chandler, Arizona |last=Aldrich |first=Lynn C. |date=July 14, 1947 |publisher=Project Blue Book Archive |type=Memorandum |id=NARA-PBB1-922 |accessdate=2013-05-16}}</ref><ref name=\"AP-20130329\">{{cite news |last=Contreras|first=Russell |title=FBI 'flying saucers' NM memo bureau's most viewed|url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20130329/DA5AVRAG0.html |date=March 29, 2013 |agency=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=2013-04-01}}</ref>\n\nThe phrase \"flying saucer\" had gained widespread attention after the summer of 1947. On June 24, a civilian pilot named [[Kenneth Arnold]] reported seeing nine objects flying in formation near [[Mount Rainier]]. Arnold timed the sighting and estimated the speed of discs to be over {{convert|1200|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. At the time, he described the objects' shape as being somewhat disc-like or saucer-like, leading to newspaper accounts of \"flying saucers\" and \"flying discs\".{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn popular usage, the term UFO came to be used to refer to claims of alien [[spacecraft]].<ref name=\"Keyhoe1953\" /> and because of the public and media ridicule associated with the topic, some investigators prefer to use such terms as ''unidentified aerial phenomenon'' (or ''UAP'') or ''anomalous phenomena,'' as in the title of the National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena (NARCAP).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.narcap.org/newspage.htm |title=On The Radar |last=Roe |first=Ted |website=NARCAP.org |publisher=National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena (NARCAP) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727111914/http://www.narcap.org/newspage.htm |archivedate=2011-07-27 |accessdate=2013-09-06}} See May 17, 2013, NARCAP.org news release: [https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?id=197024020359733&story_fbid=518978498164282 \"'Aliens', 'Alien Spaceships' & Government Coverups\"] on [[Facebook]].</ref>\n\n==Studies==\nStudies have established that the majority of UFO observations are misidentified conventional objects or natural phenomena\u2014most commonly aircraft, balloons, [[noctilucent cloud]]s, [[Polar stratospheric cloud|nacreous clouds]], or astronomical objects such as [[Meteoroid#Meteor|meteors]]<!--No correction needed.--> or bright planets with a small percentage even being [[hoax]]es.<ref group=\"note\">For example, the USAF's [[Identification studies of UFOs|Project Blue Book]] concluded that less than 2\u2009% of reported UFOs were \"psychological\" or hoaxes; [[Allan Hendry]]'s study for CUFOS had less than 1\u2009%.</ref> Between 5% and 20% of reported sightings are not explained, and therefore can be classified as unidentified in the strictest sense.

The objects were referred to as \"Russian hail\" and later as \"[[ghost rockets]]\" because it was thought that the mysterious objects were possibly Russian tests of captured German [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] or [[V-2 rocket|V2]] [[rocket]]s. Although most were thought to be such natural phenomena as meteors, more than 200 were tracked on radar by the Swedish military and deemed to be \"real physical objects.\" In a 1948 [[Classified information|top secret]] document, Swedish authorities advised the USAF Europe that some of their investigators believed these craft to be extraterrestrial in origin.<ref>[[#Swords & Powell|Swords & Powell 2012]], p. 63</ref>\n\n==Investigations==\nUFOs have been subject to investigations over the years that varied widely in scope and scientific rigor. Governments or independent academics in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Peru, France, Belgium, Sweden, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Mexico, Spain, and the [[Soviet Union]] are known to have investigated UFO reports at various times.\n\nAmong the best known government studies are the ghost rockets investigation by the Swedish military (1946\u20131947), Project Blue Book, previously [[Project Sign]] and [[Project Grudge]], conducted by the USAF from 1947 until 1969, the secret U.S. Army/Air Force [[Green fireballs#Project Twinkle|Project Twinkle]] investigation into [[green fireballs]] (1948\u20131951), the secret USAF Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ProjectBlueBookSpecialReport14 |title=Project Blue Book Special Report #14 |website=[[Internet Archive]] |publisher=[[United States Air Force]] |accessdate=2013-09-07}}</ref> by the [[Battelle Memorial Institute]], and the [[Brazilian Air Force]]'s 1977 ''[[Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Prato]]'' (Operation Saucer). France has had an ongoing investigation (GEPAN/SEPRA/[[GEIPAN]]) within its space agency [[CNES|Centre national d'\u00e9tudes spatiales]] (CNES) since 1977; the [[Politics of Uruguay|government of Uruguay]] has had a similar investigation since 1989.\n\n===Project Sign===\n{{main|Project Sign}}\nProject Sign in 1948 produced a highly classified finding (see [[Estimate of the Situation]]) that the best UFO reports probably had an extraterrestrial explanation. A top secret Swedish military opinion given to the USAF in 1948 stated that some of their analysts believed that the 1946 ghost rockets and later flying saucers had extraterrestrial origins. (For document, see [[Ghost rockets#Swedish military opinion|Ghost rockets]].) In 1954 German rocket scientist [[Hermann Oberth]] revealed that an internal [[West Germany|West German]] government investigation, which he headed, had arrived at an extraterrestrial conclusion, but this study was never made public.\n\n===Project Grudge===\n{{main|Project Grudge}}\nProject Sign was dismantled and became Project Grudge at the end of 1948. Angered by the low quality of investigations by Grudge, the Air Force Director of Intelligence reorganized it as Project Blue Book in late 1951, placing Ruppelt in charge. Blue Book closed down in 1970, using the Condon Committee's negative conclusion as a rationale, thus ending official Air Force UFO investigations. However, a 1969 USAF document, known as the Bolender memo, along with later government documents, revealed that non-public [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] UFO investigations continued after 1970. The Bolender memo first stated that \"reports of unidentified flying objects that could affect national security&nbsp;... are not part of the Blue Book system,\" indicating that more serious UFO incidents already were handled outside the public Blue Book investigation. The memo then added, \"reports of UFOs which could affect national security would continue to be handled through the standard Air Force procedures designed for this purpose.\"<ref group=\"note\">For example, current USAF general reporting procedures are in [http://www.theblackvault.com/documents/ufos/AFI10-206.pdf Air Force Instruction (AFI)10-206]. Section 5.7.3 (p. 64) lists sightings of \"unidentified flying objects\" and \"aircraft of unconventional design\" as separate categories from potentially hostile but conventional, unidentified aircraft, missiles, surface vessels, or submarines. Additionally, \"unidentified objects\" detected by missile warning systems, creating a potential risk of nuclear war, are covered by Rule 5E (p.35).</ref> In addition, in the late 1960s a chapter on UFOs in the Space Sciences course at the [[United States Air Force Academy|U.S. Air Force Academy]] gave serious consideration to possible extraterrestrial origins. When word of the curriculum became public, the Air Force in 1970 issued a statement to the effect that the book was outdated and that cadets instead were being informed of the [[Condon Committee|Condon Report]]'s negative conclusion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cufon.org/cufon/afu.htm |title=Introductory Space Science |website=CUFON.org |publisher=Computer UFO Network (CUFON) |location=West Jacksonville, FL |accessdate=2013-05-16}} Air Force Academy UFO material.</ref>\n\n===USAF Regulation 200-2===\n[[s:Air Force Regulation 200-2, Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting|Air Force Regulation 200-2]],<ref name=\"AFD-070703-004\">{{cite web |url=http://www.foia.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070703-004.pdf |title=AFD-070703-004.pdf |work=Air Force Freedom of Information Act |publisher=United States Air Force |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-09-07}}</ref> issued in 1953 and 1954, defined an Unidentified Flying Object (\"UFOB\") as \"any airborne object which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features, does not conform to any presently known aircraft or missile type, or which cannot be positively identified as a familiar object.\" The regulation also said UFOBs were to be investigated as a \"possible threat to the security of the United States\" and \"to determine technical aspects involved.\"  The regulation went on to say that \"it is permissible to inform news media representatives on UFOB's when the object is positively identified as a familiar object,\" but added: \"For those objects which are not explainable, only the fact that ATIC [Air Technical Intelligence Center] will analyze the data is worthy of release, due to many unknowns involved.\"<ref name=\"AFD-070703-004\" />\n\n===Project Blue Book===\n{{main|Project Blue Book}}\n[[J. Allen Hynek]], a trained astronomer who served as a scientific advisor for Project Blue Book, was initially skeptical of UFO reports, but eventually came to the conclusion that many of them could not be satisfactorily explained and was highly critical of what he described as \"the cavalier disregard by Project Blue Book of the principles of scientific investigation.\"<ref>[[#Hynek 1972|Hynek 1972]], p. 76</ref> Leaving government work, he founded the privately funded CUFOS, to whose work he devoted the rest of his life. Other private groups studying the phenomenon include the MUFON, a grass roots organization whose investigator's handbooks go into great detail on the documentation of alleged UFO sightings.\n\nLike Hynek, [[Jacques Vall\u00e9e]], a scientist and prominent UFO researcher, has pointed to what he believes is the scientific deficiency of most UFO research, including government studies. He complains of the mythology and cultism often associated with the phenomenon, but alleges that several hundred professional scientists\u2014a group both he and Hynek have termed \"the invisible college\"\u2014continue to study UFOs in private.<ref name=\"Revelations\" />\n\n===Scientific studies===\nThe study of UFOs has received little support in mainstream scientific literature. Official studies ended in the U.S. in December 1969, following the statement by the government scientist [[Edward Condon]] that further study of UFOs could not be justified on grounds of scientific advancement.<ref name=\"COMETA\"/><ref>[[#Swords & Powell|Swords & Powell 2012]], pp. 306\u2013332</ref> The Condon Report and its conclusions were endorsed by the National Academy of Scientists, of which Condon was a member. On the other hand, a scientific review by the UFO subcommittee of the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] (AIAA) disagreed with Condon's conclusion, noting that at least 30 percent of the cases studied remained unexplained and that scientific benefit might be gained by continued study.\n\nCritics argue that all UFO evidence is anecdotal<ref name=\"Demon Haunted\">{{cite book |last=Sagan |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Sagan |title=[[The Demon-Haunted World|The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark]] |edition=1st |date=1995 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=0-394-53512-X |oclc=779687822 |lccn=95034076 |ref=Sagan 1995}}</ref> and can be explained as prosaic natural phenomena. Defenders of UFO research counter that knowledge of observational data, other than what is reported in the popular media, is limited in the scientific community and that further study is needed.<ref name=\"Revelations\" /><ref name=\"FSS\">[[#Friedman 2008|Friedman 2008]]</ref>\n\nNo official government investigation has ever publicly concluded that UFOs are indisputably real, physical objects, extraterrestrial in origin, or of concern to national defense. These same negative conclusions also have been found in studies that were highly classified for many years, such as the UK's [[Flying Saucer Working Party]], [[Project Condign]], the U.S. CIA-sponsored Robertson Panel, the U.S. military investigation into the green fireballs from 1948 to 1951, and the Battelle Memorial Institute study for the USAF from 1952 to 1955 (Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14).\n\nSome public government reports have acknowledged the possibility of physical reality of UFOs, but have stopped short of proposing extraterrestrial origins, though not dismissing the possibility entirely. Examples are the Belgian military investigation into [[Belgian UFO wave|large triangles over their airspace]] in 1989\u20131991 and the 2009 [[Uruguayan Air Force]] study conclusion (see below).\n\nSome private studies have been neutral in their conclusions, but argued that the inexplicable core cases call for continued scientific study. Examples are the Sturrock panel study of 1998 and the 1970 AIAA review of the Condon Report.\n\n===United States===\nU.S. investigations into UFOs include:\n\n* The [[Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit]] (IPU), established by the U.S. Army sometime in the 1940s, and about which little is known. In 1987, British UFO researcher Timothy Good received from the Army's director of counter-intelligence a letter confirming the existence of the IPU. The letter stated that \"the aforementioned Army unit was disestablished during the late 1950s and never reactivated.

It reported that \"the phenomenon is something real and not visionary or fictitious,\" that there were objects in the shape of a disc, metallic in appearance, and as big as man-made aircraft. They were characterized by \"extreme rates of climb [and] maneuverability,\" general lack of noise, absence of trail, occasional formation flying, and \"evasive\" behavior \"when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar,\" suggesting a controlled craft. It was therefore recommended in late September 1947 that an official Air Force investigation be set up to investigate the phenomenon. It was also recommended that other government agencies should assist in the investigation.<ref group=\"note\">The so-called [http://www.majesticdocuments.com/pdf/twiningopinionamc_23sept47.pdf Twining memo of Sept. 23, 1947], by future USAF Chief of Staff, General [[Nathan Farragut Twining|Nathan Twining]], specifically recommended intelligence cooperation with the Army, Navy, [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], the Defense Department's Joint Research and Development Board, Air Force Scientific Advisory Board, [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA), Project [[RAND]], and the [[Nuclear aircraft|Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft]] (NEPA) project.</ref>\n\n====Project Sign====\nThis led to the creation of the Air Force's Project Sign at the end of 1947, one of the earliest government studies to come to a secret extraterrestrial conclusion. In August 1948, Sign investigators wrote a [[Estimate of the Situation|top-secret intelligence estimate]] to that effect, but the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Air Force Chief of Staff]] [[Hoyt Vandenberg]] ordered it destroyed. The existence of this suppressed report was revealed by several insiders who had read it, such as astronomer and USAF consultant J. Allen Hynek and Capt. Edward J.

This study concluded UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat to national security. One OS/I memo to the CIA Director (DCI) in December read: <blockquote>the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must have immediate attention&nbsp;... Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such a nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or any known types of aerial vehicles.</blockquote> The matter was considered so urgent that OS/I drafted a memorandum from the DCI to the NSC proposing that the NSC establish an investigation of UFOs as a priority project throughout the intelligence and the defense research and development community. It also urged the DCI to establish an external research project of top-level scientists, now known as the Robertson Panel to analyze the problem of UFOs. The OS/I investigation was called off after the Robertson Panel's negative conclusions in January 1953.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/97unclass/ufo.html |title=CIA's Role in the Study of UFOs, 1947-90 |last=Haines |first=Gerald K. |date=1997 |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |oclc=713270503 |accessdate=2013-07-13}}</ref>\n\n====The Condon Committee====\n{{main|Condon Committee}}\nA public research effort conducted by the Condon Committee for the USAF, which arrived at a negative conclusion in 1968, marked the end of the U.S. government's official investigation of UFOs, though various government intelligence agencies continue unofficially to investigate or monitor the situation.<ref group=\"note\">See, e.g., the [[1976 Tehran UFO incident]] where a Defense Intelligence Agency report on the event had a distribution list that included the White House, Secretary of State, Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Security Agency (NSA), and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

He claimed that photographs of the [[far side of the Moon]] taken by the Soviet lunar probe [[Luna 3]] in 1959 were fake, and that there were cities, trees and snow-capped mountains on the far side of the Moon. Among copycats was a shadowy British figure named [[Cedric Allingham]].\n* Ed Walters, a building contractor, in 1987 allegedly perpetrated a hoax in [[Gulf Breeze, Florida]]. Walters claimed at first having seen a small UFO flying near his home and took some photographs of the craft. Walters reported and documented a series of UFO sightings over a period of three weeks and took several photographs. These sightings became famous and were called [[Gulf Breeze UFO incident]]. Three years later, in 1990, after the Walters family had moved, the new residents discovered a model of a UFO poorly hidden in the attic that bore an undeniable resemblance to the craft in Walters' photographs.

In that latest poll, 56 percent thought UFOs were real craft and 48 percent that aliens had visited the Earth. Again, about 70 percent felt the government was not sharing everything it knew about UFOs or extraterrestrial life.
