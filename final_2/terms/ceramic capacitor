It is constructed of two or more alternating layers of [[ceramic]] and a [[metal]] layer acting as the [[electrode]]s. The composition of the ceramic material defines the electrical behavior and therefore applications. Ceramic capacitors are divided into two application classes:\n* Class 1 ceramic capacitors offer high stability and low losses for resonant circuit applications.\n* Class 2 ceramic capacitors offer high [[volumetric efficiency#Electronics|volumetric efficiency]] for buffer, by-pass, and coupling applications.\n\nCeramic capacitors, especially the multilayer style (MLCC), are the most produced and used capacitors in electronic equipment that incorporate approximately one trillion (10<sup>12</sup>) pieces per year.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite journal |last1=Ho |first1=J. |last2=Jow |first2=T.

These materials some decades later were also well-suited for further use as the [[dielectric]] for the first capacitors. Porcelain was the precursor in case of all capacitors now belonging to the family of ceramic capacitors.\n\nEven in the early years of [[Marconi]]'s wireless transmitting apparatus porcelain capacitors were used for high voltage and high frequency application in the [[transmitter]]s. On receiver side the smaller mica capacitors were used for resonant circuits. Mica dielectric capacitors were invented in 1909 by William Dubilier. Prior to World War II, mica was the most common dielectric for capacitors in the United States.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nMica is a natural material and not available in unlimited quantities. So in the mid-1920s the deficiency of mica in Germany and the experience in porcelain\u2014a special class of ceramic\u2014led in Germany to the first capacitors using ceramic as dielectric, founding a new family of ceramic capacitors. [[Dielectric#Paraelectricity|Paraelectric]] [[titanium dioxide]] ([[rutile]]) was used as the first ceramic dielectric because it had a linear temperature dependence of capacitance for temperature compensation of resonant circuits and can replace mica capacitors. 1926 these ceramic capacitors were produced in small quantities with increasing quantities in the 1940s. The style of these early ceramics was a disc with metallization on both sides contacted with tinned wires. This style predates the transistor and was used extensively in vacuum-tube equipment (e.g., radio receivers) from about 1930 through the 1950s.\n\nBut this paraelectric dielectric had relatively low [[permittivity]] so that only small capacitance values could be realized. The expanding market of radios in the 1930s and 1940s create a demand for higher capacitance values but below electrolytic capacitors for HF decoupling applications. Discovered in 1921, the ferroelectric ceramic material [[barium titanate]] with a [[permittivity]] in the range of 1,000, about ten times greater than titanium dioxide or mica, began to play a much larger role in electronic applications.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /><ref name=Waugh>Mark D. Waugh, Murata, Design solutions for DC bias in multilayer ceramic capacitors [http://www.murata.com/products/article/pdf/pp1008.pdf PDF] {{wayback|url=http://www.murata.com/products/article/pdf/pp1008.pdf |date=20120513004531 }}</ref>\n\nThe higher permittivity resulted in much higher capacitance values, but this was coupled with relatively unstable electrical parameters. Therefore, these ceramic capacitors only could replace the commonly used mica capacitors for applications where stability was less important. Smaller dimensions, as compared to the mica capacitors, lower production costs and independence from mica availability accelerated their acceptance.\n\n[[File:Keramikkondensator roehrchen IMGP5376.jpg|thumb|left|Ceramic tube capacitor, the typical style of ceramic capacitors in the 1950s and 1970s]]\n\nThe fast-growing broadcasting industry after the Second World War drove deeper understanding of the [[crystallography]], phase transitions and the chemical and mechanical optimization of the ceramic materials. Through the complex mixture of different basic materials, the electrical properties of ceramic capacitors can be precisely adjusted. To distinguish the electrical properties of ceramic capacitors, standardization defined several different application classes (Class 1, Class 2, Class 3). It is remarkable, that the different development during the War and the time afterwards in the US and the European market had leads to different definitions of these classes (EIA vs IEC) and only recently since 2010 a worldwide harmonization to the IEC standardization takes place.\n\nThe typical style for ceramic capacitors beneath the disc (at that time called condensers) in radio applications at the time after the War from the 1950s through the 1970s was a ceramic tube covered with tin or silver on both the inside and outside surface. It included relatively long terminals forming, together with resistors and other components, a tangle of open circuit wiring.\n\nThe easy-to-mold ceramic material facilitated the development of special and large styles of ceramic capacitors for high-voltage, high-frequency (RF) and power applications\n\n[[File:CPU-Beschaltung-mit MLCC-P1040239-d.jpg|thumb|right|MLCCs as decoupling capacitors around a [[microprocessor]]]]\nWith the development of [[semiconductor]] technology in the 1950s, barrier layer capacitors, or IEC class 3/EIA class IV capacitors, were developed using [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] ferroelectric ceramics. Because this doped material was not suitable to produce multilayers, they were replaced decades later by Y5V class 2 capacitors.\n\nThe early style of the ceramic disc capacitor can be cheaper produced than the common ceramic tube capacitors in the 1950s and 1970s. It was an American company in the midst of the [[Apollo program]], launched in 1961, pioneered the stacking of multiple discs to create a monolithic block. This \"multi-layer ceramic capacitor\" (MLCC) was compact and offered high-capacitance capacitors.<ref name=Murata>[http://www.murata.com/products/article/pp09e1/1.html Murata, Technical Report, Evolving Capacitors] {{wayback|url=http://www.murata.com/products/article/pp09e1/1.html |date=20120617024132 }}</ref> The production of these capacitors using the tape casting and ceramic-electrode [[cofiring|cofiring processes]] was a great manufacturing challenge. MLCCs expanded the range of applications to those requiring larger capacitance values in smaller cases. These ceramic chip capacitors were the driving force behind the conversion of electronic devices from [[Through-hole technology|through-hole]] mounting to [[surface-mount technology]] in the 1980s. Polarized electrolytic capacitors could be replaced by non-polarized ceramic capacitors, simplifying the mounting.\n\n{{As of|2012}}, more than 10<sup>12</sup> MLCCs were manufactured each year.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Along with the style of ceramic chip capacitors, ceramic disc capacitors are often used as safety capacitors in [[electromagnetic interference]] suppression applications. Besides these, large ceramic power capacitors for high voltage or high frequency transmitter applications are also to be found.\n\nNew developments in ceramic materials have been made with anti-ferroelectric ceramics. This material has a nonlinear antiferroelectric/ferroelectric phase change that allows increased energy storage with higher volumetric efficiency. They are used for energy storage (for example, in detonators).<ref>W. Hackenberger, S. Kwon, E. Alberta, TRS Technologies Inc, Advanced Multilayer Capacitors Using High Energy Density Antiferroelectric Ceramics [http://ecadigitallibrary.com/pdf/CARTSUSA08/2_6a%20Hackenberger-final.pdf PDF]</ref>\n\n==Application classes, definitions==\nThe different ceramic materials used for ceramic capacitors, [[Paraelectricity|paraelectric]] or [[Ferroelectricity|ferroelectric]] ceramics, influences the electrical characteristics of the capacitors. Using mixtures of paraelectric substances based on titanium dioxide results in very stable and linear behavior of the capacitance value within a specified temperature range and low losses at high frequencies. But these mixtures have a relatively low [[permittivity]] so that the capacitance values of these capacitors are relatively small.\n\nHigher capacitance values for ceramic capacitors can be attained by using mixtures of ferroelectric materials like barium titanate together with specific oxides. These dielectric materials have much higher permittivities, but at the same time their capacitance value are more or less nonlinear over the temperature range, and losses at high frequencies are much higher. These different electrical characteristics of ceramic capacitors requires to group them into \"application classes\". The definition of the application classes comes from the standardization. As of 2013, two sets of standards were in use, one from [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) and the other from the now-defunct [[Electronic Industries Alliance]] (EIA).\n\nThe definitions of the application classes given in the two standards are different. The following table shows the different definitions of the application classes for ceramic capacitors:\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable centered\" style=\"text-align:center;width:45em\"\n|+ Different definitions of application classes for ceramic capacitors\n|-\n!

They offer the most stable voltage, temperature, and to some extent, frequency. They have the lowest losses and therefore are especially suited for resonant circuit applications where stability is essential or where a precisely defined temperature coefficient is required, for example in compensating temperature effects for a circuit. The basic materials of class 1 ceramic capacitors are composed of a mixture of finely ground granules of paraelectric materials such as [[Titanium dioxide]] ({{chem|Ti|O|2}}), modified by additives of Zinc, Zirconium, Niobium, Magnesium, Tantalum, Cobalt and Strontium, which are necessary to achieve the capacitor's desired linear characteristics.<ref name=\"autogenerated2002\">{{citation/core|Surname1=Otto Zinke|Surname2=Hans Seither|Title=Widerst\u00e4nde, Kondensatoren, Spulen und ihre Werkstoffe |Edition=2.|Publisher=Springer|PublicationPlace=Berlin|Year=2002|Date=  2002|language=German}}</ref><ref>W.

The additives of the chemical composition are used to adjust precisely the desired temperature characteristic.\nClass 1 ceramic capacitors have the lowest [[volumetric efficiency]] among ceramic capacitors. This is the result of the relatively low [[permittivity]] (6 to 200) of the paraelectric materials. Therefore, class 1 capacitors have capacitance values in the lower range.\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable float-right\" style=\"text-align:center; width:25em\"\n|+ Ceramic materials for class 1 ceramic capacitors\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\"\n!

These capacitors have very low electrical losses with a dissipation factor of approximately 0.15%. They undergo no significant aging processes and the capacitance value is nearly independent of the applied voltage. These characteristics allow applications for high Q filters, in resonant circuits and oscillators (for example, in [[phase-locked loop]] circuits).\n\nThe EIA RS-198 standard codes ceramic class 1 capacitors with a three character code that indicates temperature coefficient. The first letter gives the significant figure of the change in capacitance over temperature (temperature coefficient \u03b1) in [[Parts-per notation|ppm/K]]. The second character gives the multiplier of the temperature coefficient. The third letter gives the maximum tolerance from that in ppm/K.

Note that the IEC and EIA capacitor codes are industry capacitor codes and not the same as military capacitor codes.\n\nClass 1 capacitors include capacitors with different temperature coefficients \u03b1. Especially, NP0/CG/C0G capacitors with an \u03b1 \u00b10\u202210<sup>\u22126</sup>&nbsp;/K and an \u03b1 tolerance of 30&nbsp;[[parts per million|ppm]] are technically of great interest. These capacitors have a capacitance variation dC/C of \u00b10.54% within the temperature range \u221255 to +125&nbsp;\u00b0C. This enables accurate frequency response over a wide temperature range (in, for example, resonant circuits). The other materials with their special temperature behavior are used to compensate a counter temperature run of parallel connected components like coils in oscillator circuits. Class 1 capacitors exhibit very small tolerances of the rated capacitance.\n\n<gallery caption=\" Idealized curves of different class 1 ceramic capacitors and representation of the tolerance range of temperature coefficient \u03b1\n\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center\" align=\"center\">\nFile: MLCC-Klasse 1-Kurven-engl.svg| Idealized curves of different class 1 ceramic capacitors\nFile: MLCC-NP0-Kurve-engl.svg| representation of the tolerance range of temperature coefficient \u03b1\n</gallery>\n\n===Class 2 ceramic capacitors===\n[[File:MLCC-Cap-Temp-Klasse-2-Kurven-engl.svg|thumb|right|Class 2 ceramic capacitors with their typical tolerances of the temperature dependent capacitance (colored areas)]]\n\nClass 2 ceramic capacitors have a dielectric with a high permittivity and therefore a better volumetric efficiency than class 1 capacitors, but lower accuracy and stability. The ceramic dielectric is characterized by a nonlinear change of capacitance over the temperature range. The capacitance value also depends on the applied voltage. They are suitable for bypass, coupling and decoupling applications or for frequency discriminating circuits where low losses and high stability of capacitance are less important. They typically exhibit [[Ceramic capacitor#Microphony|microphony]].\n\nClass 2 capacitors are made of [[Ferroelectricity|ferroelectric]] materials such as [[barium titanate]] ({{chem|Ba|Ti|O|3}}) and suitable additives such as [[aluminium silicate]], [[Talc|magnesium silicate]] and [[aluminium oxide]]. These ceramics have high to very high permittivity (200 to 14,000), which depends on the [[field strength]]. Hence the capacitance value of class 2 capacitors is nonlinear. It depends on temperature and voltage applied. Additionally class 2 capacitors age over time.<ref name=\"autogenerated2002\" />\n\nHowever, the high permittivity supports high capacitance values in small devices. Class 2 capacitors are significantly smaller than class 1 devices at the equal rated capacitance and voltage. They are suitable for applications that require the capacitor to maintain only a minimum value of capacitance, for example, buffering and filtering in power supplies and coupling and decoupling of electric signals.\n\nClass 2 capacitors are labeled according to the change in capacitance over the temperature range. The most widely used classification is based on the EIA RS-198 standard and uses a three-digit code. The first character is a letter that gives the low-end [[operating temperature]]. The second gives the high-end operating temperature, and the final character gives capacitance change over that temperature range:\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable centered\" style=\"text-align:center;width:45em\"\n|+ Class 2 ceramic capacitors<br /> Code system regarding to EIA RS-198 for some temperature ranges and inherent change of capacitance\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\"\n!

Similar to X7R, military type BX cannot vary more than 15% over temperature, and in addition, must remain within +15%/-25&nbsp;% at maximum rated voltage.  Type BR has a TVC limit of +15%/-40%.\n\n===Class 3 ceramic capacitors===\nClass 3 [[barrier layer]] or [[Semiconductor|semiconductive]] ceramic capacitors have very high permittivity, up to 50,000 and therefore a better volumetric efficiency than class 2 capacitors. However, these capacitors have worse electrical characteristics, including lower accuracy and stability. The dielectric is characterized by very high nonlinear change of capacitance over the temperature range. The capacitance value additionally depends on the voltage applied. As well, they have very high losses and age over time.\n\nBarrier layer ceramic capacitors are made of doped ferroelectric materials such as [[barium titanate]] ({{chem|Ba|Ti|O|3}}). As this ceramic technology improved in the mid-1980s, barrier layer capacitors became available in values of up to 100&nbsp;\u00b5F, and at that time it seemed that they could substitute for smaller [[electrolytic capacitor]]s.\n[[File:Sperrschichtkondensator-WIKI-English.png|center|300px|Design and functional principle of a barrier layer capacitor]]\nBecause it is not possible to build multilayer capacitors with this material, only leaded single layer types are offered in the market.\n<ref>Yellow Stone corp.

As a consequence, these capacitors are no longer standardized by IEC.\n\n==Construction and styles==\n<center>\n<gallery caption=\"Basic structure of ceramic capacitors\" class=\"centered\">\nFile: MLCC-Principle.svg | Construction of a multilayer ceramic chip capacitor (MLCC), 1 = Metallic electrodes, 2 = Dielectric ceramic, 3 = Connecting terminals\nFile:Ceramic disc capacitor.png |Construction of a ceramic disc capacitor\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\nCeramic capacitors are composed of a mixture of finely ground granules of paraelectric or ferroelectric materials, appropriately mixed with other materials to achieve the desired characteristics. From these powder mixtures, the ceramic is [[sintering|sintered]] at high temperatures. The ceramic forms the dielectric and serves as a carrier for the metallic electrodes. The minimum thickness of the dielectric layer, which today (2013) for low voltage capacitors is in the size range of 0.5 [[micrometre|micrometers]]<ref name=Murata /> is limited downwards by the grain size of the ceramic powder. The thickness of the dielectric for capacitors with higher voltages is determined by the [[dielectric strength]] of the desired capacitor.\n\nThe electrodes of the capacitor are deposited on the ceramic layer by metallization. For MLCCs alternating metallized ceramic layers are stacked one above the other. The outstanding metallization of the electrodes at both sides of the body are connected with the contacting terminal. A lacquer or ceramic coating protects the capacitor against moisture and other ambient influences.\n\nCeramic capacitors come in various shapes and styles. Some of the most common are:\n* Multilayer ceramic chip capacitor (MLCC), rectangular block, for [[Surface-mount technology|surface mounting]]\n* Ceramic disc capacitor, single layer disc, resin coated, with [[Through-hole technology|through-hole]] leads\n* [[Feedthrough]] ceramic capacitor, used for bypass purposes in high-frequency circuits.

The composition of the mixture and the size of the powder particles, as small as 10&nbsp;nm, reflect the manufacturer's expertise.\n\nA thin ceramic foil is cast from a suspension of the powder with a suitable binder. This foil is rolled up for transport. Unrolled again, it is cut into equal-sized sheets, which are screen printed with a metal paste. These sheets become the electrodes. In an automated process, these sheets are stacked in the required number of layers and solidified by pressure. Besides the relative permittivity, the size and number of layers determines the later capacitance value. The electrodes are stacked in an alternating arrangement slightly offset from the adjoining layers so that they each can later be connected on the offset side, one left, one right. The layered stack is pressed and then cut into individual components. High mechanical precision is required, for example, to produce a 500 or more layer stack of size \"0201\" (0.5&nbsp;mm \u00d7 0.3&nbsp;mm).\n\nAfter cutting, the binder is burnt out of the stack. This is followed by sintering at temperatures between 1,200 and 1,450&nbsp;\u00b0C producing the final, mainly crystalline, structure. This burning process creates the desired dielectric properties. Burning is followed by cleaning and then metallization of both end surfaces. Through the metallization, the ends and the inner electrodes are connected in parallel and the capacitor gets its terminals. Finally a 100% measuring of the electrical values will be done and the taping for automated processing in a manufacturing device are performed.\n\n[[File:MLCC-Manufacturing-Process.png|center|500px| Simplified representation of the manufacturing process for the production of multilayer ceramic chip capacitors]]\n\n====Miniaturizing====\nThe capacitance formula (''C'')  of a MLCC capacitor is based on the formula for a plate capacitor enhanced with the number of layers:<br />\n<math>C=\\varepsilon \\cdot { {n \\cdot A} \\over {d} }</math> <br />\nwhere ''\u03b5'' stands for dielectric [[permittivity]];  ''A'' for electrode surface area; n for the number of layers; and ''d'' for the distance between the electrodes.\n[[File:MLCC-development-1995-2005.png|right|300px|Miniaturizing of MLCC chip capacitors during 1995 to 2005]]\nA thinner dielectric or a larger electrode area each increase the [[Electrical capacitance|capacitance value]], as will a dielectric material of higher permittivity.\n\nWith the progressive miniaturization of [[Digital data|digital]] electronics in recent decades, the components on the periphery of the integrated logic circuits have been scaled down as well. Shrinking an MLCC involves reducing the dielectric thickness  and increasing the number of layers. Both options require huge efforts and are connected with a lot of expertise.\n\nIn 1995 the minimum thickness of the dielectric was 4&nbsp;\u00b5m. By 2005 some manufacturers produced MLCC chips with layer thicknesses of 1&nbsp;\u00b5m. {{As of|2010}}, the minimum thickness is about 0.5&nbsp;\u00b5m.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> The field strength in the dielectric increased to 35&nbsp;V/\u00b5m.<ref>[http://www.passivecomponentmagazine.com/intel-voices-concerns-over-quality-of-high-capacitance-ceramic-chip-capacitors/ Intel Voices Concerns Over Quality of High Capacitance Ceramic Chip Capacitors]</ref>\n\nThe size reduction of these capacitors is achieved reducing powder grain size, the  assumption to make the ceramic layers thinner. In addition, the manufacturing process became more precisely controlled, so that more and more layers can be stacked.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2005, the capacitance of a Y5V MLCC capacitor of size 1206 was increased from 4.7&nbsp;\u03bcF to 100&nbsp;\u03bcF.<ref>Shoji Tsubota:''[http://www.murata.com/articles/ta0573.pdf High-Capacitance Capacitors by Murata Make Smaller Power Supplies] {{wayback|url=http://www.murata.com/articles/ta0573.pdf |date=20121105054033 }}.''

They are designed to be handled by machines rather than by humans, to reduce costs.\n\nMLCCs are manufactured in standardized shapes and sizes for comparable handling. Because the early standardization was dominated by American EIA standards the dimensions of the MLCC chips were standardized by EIA in units of inches. A rectangular chip with the dimensions of 0.06 inch length and 0.03 inch width is coded as \"0603\". This code is international and in common use. [[JEDEC]] (IEC/EN), devised a second, metric code. The EIA code and the metric equivalent of the common sizes of multilayer ceramic chip capacitors, and the dimensions in mm are shown in the following table. Missing from the table is the measure of the height \"H\". This is generally not listed, because the height of MLCC chips depends on the number of layers and thus on the capacitance. Normally, however, the height H does not exceed the width W.\n\n<center>\n{|class=\"wikitable centered \" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Table of the dimension codes and the corresponding dimensions of MLCC chip capacitors\n|-class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\"\n!

The original choices were the non-oxidizable [[noble metal]]s [[silver]] and [[palladium]] which can withstand high sintering temperatures of 1200 to 1400&nbsp;\u00b0C. They were called \"NME\" (Noble Metal Electrode) and offered very good electrical properties to class 2 capacitors. The price increase of these metals greatly increased capacitor prices.\n\nCost pressures led to the development of BME (Base Metal Electrodes) using the much cheaper materials [[nickel]] and [[copper]].<ref>Yuki Nagoshi, AEI November 2009, [http://www.catagle.com/15-1/ta0982.htm  Wielding Base Metal Yields Cheaper, Stable Class X2 Capacitors]</ref>\n\nBut BME metallization produced different electrical properties; for example, the voltage dependence of X7R capacitors increased significantly (see picture). Even the loss factor and the impedance behavior of class 2 ceramic capacitors were lessened by BME metallization.\n\nFor class 2 ceramic capacitors, because of their use in applications where it is usually not very important for the stability of the electrical properties, these negative changes, for cost reasons, were finally accepted by the market, while the NME metallization was maintained in the class 1 ceramic capacitors.\n\n====MLCC capacitance ranges====\n[[File:MLCC-Max-Kap-Kurven-engl.svg|thumb|Maximal available capacitance values of MLCC Chips. (Status Jan. 2010)]]\n\nCapacitance of MLCC chips depends on the dielectric, the size and the required voltage (rated voltage). Capacitance values start at about 1pF. The maximum capacitance value is determined by the production technique.

The resonance frequency of a capacitor is determined by the [[inductance]] of the component. The inductive parts of a capacitor are summarized in the \"ESL\", the \"equivalent series inductance L\". The smaller the inductance, the higher the resonance frequency.\n\nBecause, especially in digital signal processing, switching frequencies have continued to rise, the demand for high frequency decoupling or filter capacitors increases. With a simple design change the ESL of a MLCC chip can be reduced. Therefore, the stacked electrodes are connected on the longitudinal side with the connecting terminations. This reduces the distance that the charge carriers flow over the electrodes, which reduces inductance of the component.<ref>[http://www.avx.com/docs/catalogs/lga2t.pdf AVX, Low Inductance Capacitors] {{wayback|url=http://www.avx.com/docs/catalogs/lga2t.pdf |date=20130516004438 }}</ref>\n\nFor example, the result for X7R with 0.1&nbsp;\u00b5F in the size of 0805, with a resonance frequency of about 16&nbsp;MHz increases to about 22&nbsp;MHz if the chip has a 0508-size with terminations at the longitudinal side.\n\nAnother possibility is to form the device as an array of capacitors. Here, several individual capacitors are built in a common housing. Connecting them in parallel, the resulting ESL as well as ESR values of the components are reduced.\n\n====X2Y decoupling capacitor====\n<center>\n<gallery caption=\"X2Y decoupling capacitor\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center\" align=\"center\">\nFile:Capacitors x2y.jpg|X2Y decoupling capacitors with different case sizes\nFile:MLCC-X2Y-Decoupling-Capacitor.png| Inner construction of a X2Y capacitor\nFile:MLCC-X2Y-Layout.svg| Schematic circuit of a X2Y capacitor\nFile:MLCC-X2Y-Circuit.png| Circuit diagram of a X2Y capacitor in a decoupling circuit\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\nA standard multi-layer ceramic capacitor has many opposing electrode layers stacked inside connected with two outer terminations. The X2Y ceramic chip capacitor however is a 4 terminal chip device. It is constructed like a standard two-terminal MLCC out of the stacked ceramic layers with an additional third set of shield electrodes incorporated in the chip. These shield electrodes surround each existing electrode within the stack of the capacitor plates and are low ohmic contacted with two additional side terminations across to the capacitor terminations. The X2Y construction results in a three-node capacitive circuit that provides simultaneous line-to-line and line-to-ground filtering.<ref>[http://www.x2y.com/ X2Y Attenuators LLC]</ref><ref>[http://www.x2y.com/techsummary.htm X2Y Technology Summary]</ref><ref>[http://www.syfer.com/Capacitors_1.aspx?id=1:27343&id2=1:28844&id2=1:27300 Syfer, X2Y Technology]</ref>\n\nCapable of replacing 2 or more conventional devices, the X2Y ceramic capacitors are ideal for high frequency filtering or noise suppression of supply voltages in digital circuits, and can prove invaluable in meeting stringent [[Electromagnetic compatibility|EMC]] demands in dc motors, in automotive, audio, sensor and other applications.<ref>[http://www.syfer.com/doc_docs/sm_filter_article.pdf Multilayer Ceramic EMI-Filter, Syfer]</ref><ref>[http://www.johansondielectrics.com/x2y-products/x2y-technology-overview.html X2Y Technology overview Johanson]</ref>\n\nThe X2Y footprint results in lower mounted inductance.<ref>[http://www.x2y.com/publications/decoupling/jun21-06.pdf Decoupling Capacitors, A Designer\u2019s Roadmap to Optimal Decoupling Networks for Integrated Circuits]</ref> This is particularly of interest for use in high-speed digital circuits with clock rates of several 100&nbsp;MHz and upwards. There the decoupling of the individual supply voltages on the circuit board is difficult to realize due to parasitic inductances of the supply lines. A standard solution with conventional ceramic capacitors requires the parallel use of many conventional MLCC chips with different capacitance values. Here X2Y capacitors are able to replace up to five equal-sized ceramic capacitors on the PCB.<ref>[http://www.x2y.com/techlib.htm X2Y Capacitor Technology]</ref> However, this particular type of ceramic capacitor is patented, so these components are still comparatively expensive.\n\nAn alternative to X2Y capacitors may be a \"three-terminal capacitor.<ref>[http://www.murata.com/~/media/webrenewal/products/emc/emifil/knowhow/20to22.ashx Three-terminal Capacitor Structure, Murata]</ref>\n\n====Mechanical susceptibility====\n\nCeramic is on the one hand a very solid material; on the other hand, it breaks even at relatively low mechanical stress. MLCC chips as [[Surface-mount technology|surface-mounted]] [[Electronic component|components]] are susceptible to flexing stresses since they are mounted directly on the substrate. They are stuck between soldered joints on the [[printed circuit board]] (PCB), and are often exposed to mechanical stresses, for example, if vibration or a bump impacts the circuit board. They are also more sensitive to thermal stresses than leaded components. Excess solder fillet height can multiply these stresses and cause chip cracking. Of all influencing factors, causing a mechanical shock stress to the PCB proved to be the most critical one.<ref>P. O\u2019Malley, D. Wang, H. Duong, Anh Lai, Z. Zelle, May 25, 2011 [http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2011fuze/SessionIIIAOMalley.pdf Ceramic Capacitor Failures and Lessons Learned, Presented to the 55th Annual NDIA Fuze Conference]</ref> The reason is that forces induced by those kinds of stresses are more or less transmitted undampened to the components via the PCB and solder joints.\n\n<center>\n<gallery caption=\"MLCC chips \u2013 correct mounted \u2013 cracked chip \u2013 substrate bending test\" class=\"float-right\" style=\"margin:1em\">\nFile: SMD-chip-soldering.svg|Correct mounted and soldered MLCC chip on a PCB\nFile: MLCC-Schliffbild-mit-Bruch.png|Micrograph of broken ceramic in a MLCC chip\nFile: MLCC-Flexure-Test engl.svg|Simplified figure of a bending test for soldered MLCC\n</gallery>\n</center>\nThe capability of MLCC chips to withstand mechanical stress is tested by a so-called substrate bending test. Here, a test PCB with a soldered MLCC chip between two support points is bent by a punch at a path length of 1 to 3mm. The path length depends on the requirements that come out from the application. If no crack appears, the capacitors are able to withstand the wanted requirements. Cracks are usually detected by a short circuit or a change of the capacitance value in the deflected state.\n\nThe bending strength of the MLCC chip differs by the property of the ceramic, the size of the chip and the design of the capacitors. Without any special design features, NP0/C0G class 1 ceramic MLCC chips reach a typical bending strength of 2mm while larger types of X7R, Y5V class 2 ceramic chips achieved only a bending strength of approximately 1mm. Smaller chips, such as the size of 0402, reached in all types of ceramics larger bending strength values.\n\nWith special design features, particularly by special design of the electrodes and the terminations, the bending strength can be improved. For example, an internal short circuit arises by the contact of two electrodes with opposite polarity, which will be produced at the break of the ceramic in the region of the terminations. This can be prevented when the overlap surfaces of the electrodes are reduced. This is achieved e.g. by an \"Open Mode Design\" (OMD). Here a break in the region of the terminations only reduce the capacitance value a little bit (AVX, KEMET).\n\n<center>\n<gallery caption=\"Different MLCC constructions to minimize mechanical stress\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center\" align=\"center\">\nFile: MLCC-Standard-Crack.svg| Standard MLCC chip, short circuit possible if ceramic breaks due to mechanical stress\nFile: MLCC-Fail-Open-Crack.svg|\u201eOpen-Mode-Design\" MLCC chip, a break only reduces the capacitance value\nFile: MLCC-Floating-Electrode-Crack.svg|\"Floating-Electrode-Design\"-MLCC, a break only reduces the capacitance value\nFile: MLCC-FlexTerm-Crack.svg|\"Flex-Termination\" - MLCC chips, a flexible contact layer prevents breaking of the ceramic.<ref>P.

This construction works with floating electrodes without any conductive connection to the termination. A break doesn\u2019t lead to a short, only to capacitance reduction.\nHowever, both structures lead to larger designs with respect to a standard MLCC version with the same capacitance value.\n\nThe same volume with respect to standard MLCCs is achieved by the introduction of a flexible intermediate layer of a conductive polymer between the electrodes and the termination called \"Flexible Terminations\" (FT-Cap) or \"Soft Terminations\".  In this construction, the rigid metallic soldering connection can move against the flexible polymer layer, and thus can absorb the bending forces, without resulting in a break in the ceramic.<ref>Bill Sloka, Dan Skamser, Reggie Phillips, Allen Hill, Mark Laps, Roy Grace, John Prymak, Michael Randall, Aziz Tajuddin: ''[http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kfbk3.nsf/vaFeedbackFAQ/B6F1676B145ECA92852572BC0064B814/$file/2007%20CARTS%20-%20Flexure%20Robust%20Capacitors.pdf Flexure Robust Capacitors].'' CARTS, 2007.</ref>\n\n==== RFI/EMI Suppression with X- and Y-Capacitors ====\nSuppression capacitors are effective interference reduction components because their electrical [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] decreases with increasing frequency, so that at higher frequencies they short circuit electrical noise and transients between the lines, or to ground. They therefore prevent equipment and machinery (including motors, inverters, and electronic ballasts, as well as solid-state relay snubbers and spark quenchers) from sending and receiving electromagnetic and radio frequency interference as well as transients in across-the-line (X capacitors) and line-to-ground (Y capacitors) connections. X capacitors effectively absorb symmetrical, balanced, or differential interference. Y capacitors are connected in a line bypass between a line phase and a point of zero potential, to absorb asymmetrical, unbalanced, or common-mode interference.<ref>Vishay, [http://www.vishay.com/docs/26529/gentecin.pdf  General Technical Information, Radio Interference Suppression Capacitors]</ref><ref>Illinois capacitor inc.

The standardization of ceramic capacitors for lower power is oriented toward electrical and mechanical parameters as components for use in electronic equipment. The standardization of power capacitors, contrary to that, is strongly focused on protecting personnel and equipment, given by the local regulating authority.\n[[File:Kondensatoren in dobl.jpg|thumb|200px|Power ceramic capacitors in a radio-frequency transmitter station]]\nAs modern electronic equipment gained the ability to handle power levels that were previously the exclusive domain of \"electrical power\" components, the distinction between the \"electronic\" and \"electrical\" power ratings has become less distinct. In the past, the boundary between these two families was approximately at a reactive power of 200 volt-amps, but modern power electronics can handle increasing amounts of power.\n\nPower ceramic capacitors are mostly specified for much higher than 200 volt-amps. The great plasticity of ceramic raw material and the high dielectric strength of ceramics deliver solutions for many applications and are the reasons for the enormous diversity of styles within the family of power ceramic capacitors. These power capacitors have been on the market for decades. They are produced according to the requirements as class 1 power ceramic capacitors with high stability and low losses or class 2 power ceramic capacitors with high volumetric efficiency.\n\nClass 1 power ceramic capacitors are used for [[LC circuit|resonant circuit]] application in [[transmitter station]]s. Class 2 power ceramic capacitors are used for [[circuit breaker]]s, for [[Electric power distribution|power distribution lines]], for high voltage [[power supply|power supplies]] in laser-applications, for [[induction furnace]]s and in [[Voltage doubler|voltage-doubling circuits]].  Power ceramic capacitors can be supplied with high rated voltages in the range of 2&nbsp;kV up to 100&nbsp;kV.<ref>AVX, [http://www.avx.com/docs/catalogs/hp-hw-hk.pdf High Voltage Ceramic Capacitors 15 to 100 kV, Strontium based dielectric, series HP/HW/HK] {{wayback|url=http://www.avx.com/docs/catalogs/hp-hw-hk.pdf |date=20120725043109 }}</ref>\n\nThe dimensions of these power ceramic capacitors can be very large. At high power applications the losses of these capacitors can generate a lot of heat. For this reason some special styles of power ceramic capacitors have pipes for water-cooling.\n\n==Electrical characteristics==\n\n===Series-equivalent circuit===\n[[File:Film capacitor Ersatzschaltbild.svg|thumb|right|Series-equivalent circuit model of a ceramic capacitor]]\nAll electrical characteristics of ceramic capacitors can be defined and specified by a series equivalent circuit composed out of an idealized capacitance and additional electrical components, which model all losses and inductive parameters of a capacitor. In this series-equivalent circuit the electrical characteristics of a capacitors is defined by\n\n* ''C'', the capacitance of the capacitor,\n* ''R''<sub>insul</sub>, the [[Insulator (electricity)|insulation resistance]] of the dielectric, not to be confused with the insulation of the housing\n* ''R''<sub>ESR</sub>, the [[equivalent series resistance]], which summarizes all ohmic losses of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as \"ESR\".\n* ''L''<sub>ESL</sub>, the [[equivalent series inductance]], which is the effective self-inductance of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as \"ESL\".\n\nThe use of a series equivalent circuit instead of a parallel equivalent circuit is defined in IEC/EN 60384-1.\n\n===Capacitance standard values and tolerances===\nThe \"rated capacitance\" C<sub>R</sub> or \"nominal capacitance\" C<sub>N</sub> is the value for which the capacitor has been designed. The actual capacitance depends on the measuring frequency and the ambient temperature. Standardized conditions for capacitors are a low-voltage AC measuring method at a temperature of 20&nbsp;\u00b0C with frequencies of\n\n* Class 1 ceramic capacitors\n** C<sub>R</sub> &le; 100&nbsp;pF at 1&nbsp;MHz, measuring voltage 5&nbsp;V\n** C<sub>R</sub> &gt; 100&nbsp;pF at 1&nbsp;kHz, measuring voltage 5&nbsp;V\n* Class 2 ceramic capacitors\n** C<sub>R</sub> &le; 100&nbsp;pF at 1&nbsp;MHz, measuring voltage 1&nbsp;V\n** 100 pF &lt; C<sub>R</sub> &le; 10&nbsp;\u00b5F at 1&nbsp;kHz, measuring voltage 1&nbsp;V\n** C<sub>R</sub> &gt; 10&nbsp;\u00b5F at 100/120&nbsp;Hz, measuring voltage 0.5&nbsp;V\n\nCapacitors are available in different, geometrically increasing [[Preferred number|preferred values]] as specified in the [[E48 series|E series]] standards specified in IEC/EN 60063. According to the number of values per decade, these were called the E3, E6, E12, E24, etc. series. The units used to specify capacitor values includes everything from pico-farad (pF), nano-farad(nF), microfarad (\u00b5F) and farad (F).\n\nThe percentage of allowed deviation of the capacitance from the rated value is called capacitance [[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]]. The actual capacitance value must be within the tolerance limits, or the capacitor is out of specification. For abbreviated marking in tight spaces, a letter code for each tolerance is specified in IEC/EN 60062.\n\n<center>\n{| class=\" wikitable centered\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Tolerances of capacitors and their letter codes\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |E series\n! colspan=\"4\" | Tolerance\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\"\n!C<sub>R</sub> &gt; 10&nbsp;pF\n!

The narrow tolerances of E24 to E96 will be used for high-quality class 1 capacitors in circuits such as precision oscillators and timers. On the other hand, for general applications such as non-critical filtering or coupling circuits, for class 2 capacitors the tolerance series E12 down to E3 are sufficient.\n\n===Temperature dependence of capacitance===\nCapacitance of ceramic capacitors varies with temperature. The different dielectrics of the many capacitor types show great differences in temperature dependence. The temperature coefficient is expressed in [[parts per million]] (ppm) per degree Celsius for class 1 ceramic capacitors or in percent (%) over the total temperature range for class 2 capacitors.\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable centered\"\n|+ Temperature coefficients of some often used capacitors\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\"\n!

The dielectric strength of class 2 ceramic and plastic film diminishes with rising frequency. Therefore, their capacitance value decreases with increasing frequency. This phenomenon is related to the [[dielectric relaxation]] in which the time constant of the electrical dipoles is the reason for the frequency dependence of [[permittivity]]. The graph on the right hand side shows typical frequency behavior for class 2 vs class 1 capacitors.\n\n===Voltage dependence of capacitance===\n[[File:DC Bias characteristic of ferroelectrics.PNG|thumb|right| DC Bias characteristic of ferroelectrics ceramic materials]]\nCapacitance of ceramic capacitors may also change with applied voltage. This effect is more prevalent in class 2 ceramic capacitors.  The ferroelectric material depends on the applied voltage.<ref>A. Skelly, M. D.

This is not possible with ceramic capacitors. The breakdown voltage of a ceramic dielectric layer may vary depending on the electrode material and the sintering conditions of the ceramic up to a factor of 10. A high degree of precision and control of process parameters is necessary to keep the scattering of electrical properties for today's very thin ceramic layers within specified limits.\n\nThe voltage proof of ceramic capacitors is specified as rated voltage (UR). This is the maximum DC voltage that may be continuously applied to the capacitor up to the upper temperature limit. This guaranteed voltage proof is tested according to the voltages shown in the table on the right.\n\nFurthermore, in periodic life time tests (endurance tests) the voltage proof of ceramic capacitors is tested with increased test voltage (120 to 150% of U<sub>R</sub>) to ensure safe construction.\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable float-right\"\n|+ Test voltages related to IEC 60384-8/21/9/22<br />to test safe construction\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\"\n!

Impedance extends the concept of [[ohm's law]] to AC circuits, and possesses both magnitude and phase at a particular frequency, unlike resistance, which has only magnitude.\n\nImpedance is a measure of the ability of the capacitor to pass alternating currents. In this sense impedance can be used like Ohms law\n\n:<math>Z = \\frac{\\hat u}{\\hat \\imath} = \\frac{U_\\mathrm{AC}}{I_\\mathrm{AC}}.</math>\n\nto calculate either the peak or the effective value of the current or the voltage.\n\nAs shown in the series-equivalent circuit of a capacitor, the real-world component includes an ideal capacitor <math>C</math>, an inductance <math>L</math> and a resistor <math>R</math>.\n\nTo calculate the impedance <math>Z</math> the resistance and the both reactances have to be added geometrically\n:<math>Z=\\sqrt{{ESR}^2 + (X_\\mathrm{C} + (-X_\\mathrm{L}))^2}</math>\n\nwherein the capacitive reactance ([[Capacitance]]) is\n:<math> X_C= -\\frac{1}{\\omega C}</math>\n\nand an inductive reactance ([[Inductance]]) is\n:<math> X_L=\\omega L_{\\mathrm{ESL}}</math>.\nIn the special case of [[resonance]], in which both reactive resistances have the same value (<math>X_C = X_L</math>), then the impedance will only be determined by <math>{ESR}</math>.\n\n[[File:MLCC-Imp-versus-Freqenz.engl.png|thumb|center|200px|Typical curves of the impedance of X7R and NP0-MLCC-Chips]]\nData sheets of ceramic capacitors only specify the impedance magnitude <math>Z</math>. The typical impedance curve shows that with increasing frequency, impedance decreases, down to a minimum. The lower the impedance, the more easily alternating currents can pass through the capacitor. At the minimum point of the curve, the point of resonance, where X<sub>C</sub> has the same value as X<sub>L</sub>, the capacitor exhibits its lowest impedance value. Here only the ohmic ESR determines the impedance. With frequencies above the resonance, impedance increases again due to the ESL.\n\n===ESR, dissipation factor, and quality factor===\nThe summarized losses in ceramic capacitors are ohmic [[Alternating current|AC]] losses. [[Direct current|DC]] losses are specified as \"[[leakage current]]\" or \"insulating resistance\" and are negligible for an AC specification. These AC losses are nonlinear and may depend on frequency, temperature, age, and for some special types, on humidity. The losses result from two physical conditions,\n* line losses with internal supply line resistances, the contact resistance of the electrode contact, the line resistance of the electrodes\n* the [[Loss tangent|dielectric losses]] out of the [[Dipolar polarization|dielectric polarization]]\n\nThe largest share of these losses in larger capacitors is usually the frequency dependent ohmic dielectric losses. Regarding the IEC 60384-1 standard, the ohmic losses of capacitors are measured at the same frequency used to measure capacitance. These are:\n\n* 100&nbsp;kHz, 1&nbsp;MHz (preferred) or 10&nbsp;MHz for ceramic capacitors with C<sub>R</sub> \u2264 1 nF:\n* 1&nbsp;kHz or 10&nbsp;kHz for ceramic capacitors with 1 nF < C<sub>R</sub> \u2264 10 \u03bcF\n* 50/60&nbsp;Hz or 100/120&nbsp;Hz for ceramic capacitors with C<sub>R</sub> > 10 \u03bcF\n\nResults of the summarized resistive losses of a capacitor may be specified either as [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR), as [[dissipation factor]] (DF, tan \u03b4), or as [[quality factor]] (Q), depending on the application requirements.\n\nClass 2 capacitors are mostly specified with the dissipation factor, tan \u03b4. The dissipation factor is determined as the tangent of the reactance <math>X_C</math> - <math>X_L</math> and the ESR, and can be shown as the angle \u03b4 between the imaginary and impedance axes in the above vector diagram, see paragraph \"Impedance\".\n\nIf the inductance <math> ESL </math> is small, the dissipation factor can be approximated as:\n: <math>\\tan \\delta = ESR \\cdot \\omega C</math>\n\nClass 1 capacitors with very low losses are specified with a dissipation factor and often with a [[Q factor#Electrical systems|quality factor]] (Q). The quality factor is defined as the reciprocal of the dissipation factor.\n\n:<math> Q = \\frac{1}{tan \\delta} = \\frac{f_0}{B} \\ </math>\n\nThe Q factor represents the effect of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|electrical resistance]], and characterizes a resonator's [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] <math>B</math> relative to its center or resonant frequency <math>f_0</math>.  A high Q value is a mark of the quality of the resonance for resonant circuits.\n\nIn accordance with IEC 60384-8/-21/-9/-22 ceramic capacitors may not exceed the following dissipation factors:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable float-right\"\n|+ Dissipation factor tan \u03b4 <br />for class 1ceramic capacitors<br />with ''C''<sub>R</sub> \u2265 50&nbsp;pF\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\"\n!

Additionally, class 2 capacitor measurements change because of aging. Different ceramic materials have differing losses over the temperature range and the operating frequency. The changes in class 1 capacitors are in the single-digit range while class 2 capacitors have much higher changes.\n\n===HF use, inductance (ESL) and self-resonant frequency===\n[[Electrical resonance]] occurs in an ceramic capacitor at a particular [[Resonance|resonance frequency]]  where the imaginary parts of the capacitor [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] and [[admittance]]s cancel each other.\nThis frequency where X<sub>C</sub> is as high as X<sub>L</sub> is called the self-resonant frequency and can be calculated with:\n\n<math>\\omega = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{LC}}</math>\n\nwhere \u03c9 = 2\u03c0''f'', in which ''f'' is the resonance frequency in [[Hertz]], ''L'' is the inductance in [[Henry (unit)|henries]], and ''C'' is the capacitance in [[farad]]s.\n\nThe smaller the capacitance C and the inductance L the higher is the resonance frequency.\nThe self-resonant frequency is the lowest frequency at which impedance passes through a minimum. For any AC application the self-resonant frequency is the highest frequency at which a capacitor can be used as a capacitive component. At frequencies above the resonance, the impedance increases again due to ESL: the capacitor becomes an inductor with inductance equal to capacitor's ESL, and resistance equal to ESR at the given frequency.\n\nESL in industrial capacitors is mainly caused by the leads and internal connections used to connect the plates to the outside world. Larger capacitors tend to higher ESL than small ones, because the distances to the plate are longer and every millimeter increases inductance.\n\nCeramic capacitors, which are available in the range of very small capacitance values (pF and higher) are already out of their smaller capacitance values suitable for higher frequencies up to several 100&nbsp;MHz (see formula above).\nDue to the absence of leads and proximity to the electrodes, MLCC chips have significantly lower parasitic inductance than f. e. leaded types, which makes them suitable for higher frequency applications. A further reduction of parasitic inductance is achieved by contacting the electrodes on the longitudinal side of the chip instead of the lateral side.\n\nSample self-resonant frequencies for one set of NP0/C0G and one set of X7R ceramic capacitors are:<ref>[http://www.radiant.su/files/images/Syfer/mlc_capacitor_catalogue.pdf Syfer Technologies]</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n||\n! 10 pF\n! 100 pF\n! 1 nF\n! 10 nF\n! 100 nF\n! 1 \u00b5F\n|-\n!

It makes sense, however, since class 2 capacitors are much smaller than class 1, so they ought to have lower parasitic inductance.\n\n===Aging===\n[[File:Delta-Cap-versus-Zeit-engl.png|thumb|right|Aging of different Class 2 ceramic capacitors compared with NP0-Class 1 ceramic capacitor]]\nIn [[Ferroelectricity|ferroelectric]] class 2 ceramic capacitors capacitance decreases over time. This behavior is called \"aging\". Aging occurs in ferroelectric dielectrics, where domains of polarization in the dielectric contribute to total polarization. Degradation of the polarized domains in the dielectric decreases permittivity over time so that the capacitance of class 2 ceramic capacitors decreases as the component ages.<ref>{{citation/core|Surname1=K.

This law defines the decrease of capacitance as a percentage for a time decade after the soldering recovery time at a defined temperature, for example, in the period from 1 to 10 hours at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C. As the law is logarithmic, the percentage loss of capacitance will twice between 1&nbsp;h and 100&nbsp;h and 3 times between 1&nbsp;h and 1000&nbsp;h and so on. So aging is fastest near the beginning, and the capacitance value effectively stabilizes over time.\n\nThe rate of aging of class 2 capacitors mainly depends on the materials used. A rule of thumb is, the higher the temperature dependence of the ceramic, the higher the aging percentage. The typical aging of X7R ceramic capacitors is about 2.5% per decade<ref>Christopher England , Johanson dielectrics, [http://www.johansondielectrics.com/technical-notes/general/ceramic-capacitor-aging-made-simple.html Ceramic Capacitor Aging Made Simple]</ref> The aging rate of Z5U ceramic capacitors is significantly higher and can be up to 7% per decade.\n\nThe aging process of class 2 capacitors may be reversed by heating the component above the [[Curie point]].<ref name=Waugh />\n\nClass 1 capacitors do not experience ferroelectric aging like Class 2's. But environmental influences such as higher temperature, high humidity and mechanical stress can, over a longer period of time, lead to a small irreversible decline in capacitance, sometimes also called aging. The change of capacitance for P&nbsp;100 and N&nbsp;470 Class 1's is lower than 1%, for capacitors with N&nbsp;750 to N&nbsp;1500 ceramics it is \u2264 2%.\n\n===Insulation resistance and self-discharge constant===\nThe resistance of the dielectric is never infinite, leading to some level of [[Direct current|DC \"leakage current\"]], which contributes to self-discharge. For ceramic capacitors this resistance, placed in parallel with the capacitor in the series-equivalent circuit of capacitors, is called \"insulation resistance R<sub>ins</sub>\". The insulation resistance must not be confused with the outer isolation with respect to the environment.\n\nThe rate of self-discharge with decreasing capacitor voltage follows the formula\n: <math>u(t) = U_0 \\cdot \\mathrm{e}^{-t/\\tau_\\mathrm{s}},</math>\nWith the stored DC voltage <math>U_0</math> and the self-discharge constant\n: <math>\\tau_\\mathrm{s} = R_\\mathrm{ins} \\cdot C</math>\nThat means, after <math>\\tau_\\mathrm{s}\\,</math> capacitor voltage <math>U_0</math> dropped to 37% of the initial value.\n\nThe insulation resistance given in the unit M\u03a9 (10<sup>6</sup> Ohm) as well as the self-discharge constant in seconds is an important parameter for the quality of the dielectric insulation. These time values are important, for example, when a capacitor is used as timing component for relays or for storing a voltage value as in a [[sample and hold]] circuits or [[operational amplifier]]s.\n\nIn accordance with the applicable standards, Class 1 ceramic capacitors have an R<sub>ins</sub> &ge; 10,000&nbsp;M\u03a9 for capacitors with C<sub>R</sub> &le; 10&nbsp;nF or &tau;<sub>s</sub> &ge; 100&nbsp;s for capacitors with C<sub>R</sub> &gt; 10&nbsp;nF.  Class 2 ceramic capacitors have an R<sub>ins</sub> &ge; 4,000&nbsp;M\u03a9 for capacitors with C<sub>R</sub> &le; 25&nbsp;nF or &tau;<sub>s</sub> &ge; 100&nbsp;s for capacitors with C<sub>R</sub> &gt; 25&nbsp;nF.\n\nInsulation resistance and thus the self-discharge time rate are temperature dependent and decrease with increasing temperature at about 1&nbsp;M\u03a9 per 60&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n===Dielectric absorption (soakage)===\n{{main|Dielectric absorption}}\nDielectric absorption is the name given to the effect by which a capacitor, which has been charged for a long time, discharges only incompletely. Although an ideal capacitor remains at zero volts after discharge, real capacitors will develop a small voltage coming from time-delayed dipole discharging, a phenomenon that is also called [[dielectric relaxation]], \"soakage\" or \"battery action\".\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable centered\"\n|+ Values of dielectric absorption for some often used capacitors\n|- style=\"background:#abcdef;\"\n!

The voltage at the terminals generated by dielectric absorption may in some cases possibly cause problems in the function of an electronic circuit or can be a safety risk to personnel. In order to prevent shocks, most very large capacitors like power capacitors are shipped with shorting wires that are removed before use.<ref>Ken Kundert [http://www.designers-guide.org/Modeling/da.pdf Modeling Dielectric Absorption in Capacitors]</ref>\n\n===Microphony===\nAll class 2 ceramic capacitors using ferroelectric ceramics exhibit [[piezoelectricity]], and have a piezoelectric effect called [[microphonics]], microphony or in audio applications squealing.<ref>Satoshi Ishitobi, Murata, Murata Addresses Squealing in Mobile, A/V Devices {{cite web|url=http://www.murata.com/products/article/pdf/ta1282.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627041500/http://www.murata.com/products/article/pdf/ta1282.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-27 |df= }}</ref> Microphony describes the phenomenon wherein [[Electronics|electronic]] components transform mechanical [[vibration]]s into an electrical signal which in many cases is undesired [[Noise (electronics)|noise]].<ref>Kemet, Capacitors for Reduced Microphonics and Sound Emissions, [http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kfbk3.nsf/vaFeedbackFAQ/118EBDDDFA5D532C852572BF0046B776/$file/2007%20CARTS%20-%20Reduced%20Microphonics%20and%20Sound%20Emissions.pdf PDF]</ref> Sensitive electronic preamplifiers generally use class 1 capacitors to avoid this effect.\n\nIn the reverse microphonic effect, the varying electric field between the capacitor plates exerts a physical force, moving them as a speaker.

The heat of the solder bath, especially for SMD styles, can cause changes of contact resistance between terminals and electrodes. For ferroelectric class 2 ceramic capacitors, the soldering temperature is above the [[Curie point]]. The polarized domains in the dielectric are going back and the aging process of class 2 ceramic capacitors is starting again.<ref name=Waugh />\n\nHence after soldering a recovery time of approximately 24 hours is necessary. After recovery some electrical parameters like capacitance value, ESR, leakage currents are changed irreversibly. The changes are in the lower percentage range depending on the style of capacitor.\n\n==Additional information==\n\n===Standardization===\nThe standardization for all [[electrical]], [[electronics|electronic]] components and related technologies follows the rules given by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC),<ref>[http://www.iec.ch/ IEC Homepage]</ref> a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]], non-governmental international [[standards organization]].<ref>[http://webstore.iec.ch/?ref=menu IEC Webstore]</ref><ref>[http://www.beuth.de/de/ IEC/EN/DIN Standards, Beuth-Verlag]</ref>\n\nThe definition of the characteristics and the procedure of the test methods for [[capacitor]]s for use in electronic equipment are set out in the generic specification:\n* IEC 60384-1, Fixed capacitors for use in electronic equipment - Part 1: Generic specification\n\nThe tests and requirements to be met by ceramic capacitors for use in electronic equipment for approval as standardized types are set out in the following sectional specifications:\n\n* IEC 60384-8, Fixed capacitors of ceramic dielectric, Class 1\n* IEC 60384-9, Fixed capacitors of ceramic dielectric, Class 2\n* IEC 60384-21, Fixed surface mount multilayer capacitors of ceramic dielectric, Class 1\n* IEC 60384-22, Fixed surface mount multilayer capacitors of ceramic dielectric, Class 2\n\n===Tantalum capacitor replacement===\n\nMultilayer ceramic capacitors are increasingly used to replace [[tantalum capacitor|tantalum]] and low capacitance aluminium [[electrolytic capacitor|electrolytic]] capacitors in applications such as bypass or high frequency [[switched-mode power supplies]] as their cost, reliability and size becomes competitive. In many applications, their low ESR allows the use of a lower nominal capacitance value.<ref>[http://powerelectronics.com/mag/power_multilayer_ceramics_tantalums/ Power Electronics Technology - Multilayer Ceramics or Tantalums]</ref><ref>Johanson dielectrics, \"Advanced Ceramic Solutions\", Tantalum Replacement [http://www.johansondielectrics.com/images/stories/tech-notes/application/JDI_Tanceram-Apps_3-03.pdf PDF]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>Texas Instruments, Ceramic Capacitors Replace Tantalum Capacitors in LDOs, Application Report SLVA214A\u2013August 2005\u2013Revised October 2006 [http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slva214a/slva214a.pdf PDF]</ref><ref>Rutronik, Guideline for replacing a tantalum capacitor with a MLCC [http://www.rutronik.com/fileadmin/downloads/printmedia/products/02_passive/ceramic_capacitors_en.pdf PDF]</ref><ref>Kemet, How do I choose between a polymer aluminum, ceramic and tantalum capacitor? {{cite web|url=http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kfbk3.nsf/vaFeedbackFAQ/0CBE2E5238A759A385256A8700515CCD?OpenDocument |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224102205/http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kfbk3.nsf/vaFeedbackFAQ/0CBE2E5238A759A385256A8700515CCD?OpenDocument |archivedate=2013-12-24 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Features and disadvantages of ceramic capacitors===\nFor features and disadvantages of ceramic capacitors see main article [[Types of capacitor#Capacitor features comparisons]]\n\n==Marking==\n{{See also|Preferred number#E series}}\n\n===Imprinted markings===\nIf space permits ceramic capacitors, like most other electronic components, have imprinted markings to indicate the manufacturer, the type, their electrical and thermal characteristics and their date of manufacture. In the ideal case, if they are large enough, the capacitor will be marked with:\n* manufacturer's name or trademark;\n* manufacturer's type designation;\n* rated capacitance;\n* tolerance on rated capacitance\n* rated voltage and nature of supply (AC or DC)\n* climatic category or rated temperature;\n* year and month (or week) of manufacture;\n* certification marks of safety standards (for safety EMI/RFI suppression capacitors)\n\nSmaller capacitors use a shorthand notation, to display all the relevant information in the limited space. The most commonly used format is: XYZ J/K/M VOLTS V, where XYZ represents the capacitance (calculated as XY \u00d7 10<sup>Z</sup> pF), the letters J, K or M indicate the tolerance (\u00b15%, \u00b110% and \u00b120% respectively) and VOLTS V represents the working voltage.\n\n====Examples====\n* A capacitor with the following text on its body: '''105K 330V''' has a capacitance of 10 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> pF = 1 \u00b5F (K = \u00b110%) with a working voltage of 330 V.\n* A capacitor with the following text: '''473M 100V''' has a capacitance of 47 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> pF = 47 nF (M = \u00b120%) with a working voltage of 100 V.\n\nCapacitance, tolerance and date of manufacture can be identified with a short code according to IEC/EN 60062. Examples of short-marking of the rated capacitance (microfarads):\n* \u00b547 = 0.47 \u00b5F, 4\u00b57 = 4.7 \u00b5F, 47\u00b5 = 47 \u00b5F\n\nThe date of manufacture is often printed in accordance with international standards.\n* Version 1: coding with year/week numeral code, \"1208\" is  \"2012, week number 8\".\n* Version 2: coding with year code/month code,\nYear code: \"R\" = 2003, \"S\"= 2004, \"T\" = 2005, \"U\" = 2006, \"V\" = 2007, \"W\" = 2008, \"X\" = 2009, \"A\" = 2010, \"B\" = 2011, \"C\" = 2012, \"D\" = 2013 etc.\n\nMonth code: \"1\" to \"9\" = Jan. to Sept., \"O\" = October, \"N\" = November, \"D\" = December\n\n\"X5\" is then \"2009, May\"\n\nFor very small capacitors like MLCC chips no marking is possible. Here only the traceability of the manufacturers can ensure the identification of a type.\n\n===Colour coding===\n{{Main|Electronic color code}}\n\nThe identification of modern capacitors has no detailed color coding.\n\n==Manufacturers and products==\nAn overview of worldwide operating manufacturers and their product ranges {{as of|2012}} is given in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable centered\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Ceramic capacitors product range of large worldwide operating manufacturers\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Manufacturer\n! colspan=\"6\" | Product range\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!
