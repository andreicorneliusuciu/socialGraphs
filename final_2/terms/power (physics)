It is the amount of [[energy (physics)|energy]] consumed per unit time.  Having no direction, it is a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity.  In the [[SI system]], the unit of power is the [[joule]] per second (J/s), known as the [[watt]] in honour of [[James Watt]], the eighteenth-century developer of the [[Watt steam engine|steam engine]].  Another common and traditional measure is [[horsepower]] (comparing to the power of a horse).  Being the rate of work, the equation for power can be written:\n\n:<math>P=\\frac{W}{t}</math>\n\nThe [[integral]] of power over time defines the work performed. Because this integral depends on the trajectory of the point of application of the force and torque, this calculation of work is said to be [[Nonholonomic system|path dependent]].\n\nAs a physical concept, power requires both a change in the physical universe and a specified time in which the change occurs. This is distinct from the concept of work, which is only measured in terms of a net change in the state of the physical universe. The same amount of work is done when carrying a load up a flight of stairs whether the person carrying it walks or runs, but more power is needed for running because the work is done in a shorter amount of time. \n\nThe output power of an electric motor is the product of the [[torque]] that the motor generates and the [[angular velocity]] of its output shaft. The power involved in moving a vehicle is the product of the traction force of the wheels and the velocity of the vehicle. The rate at which a light bulb converts electrical energy into light and heat is measured in watts&mdash;the higher the wattage, the more power, or equivalently the more electrical energy is used per unit time.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter= 6. Power|authors= Halliday and Resnick|title=Fundamentals of Physics|year= 1974}}</ref><ref>Chapter 13, &sect; 3, pp 13-2,3 ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'' Volume I, 1963</ref>\n\n==Units==\nThe dimension of power is energy divided by time. The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of power is the [[watt]] (W), which is equal to one [[joule]] per second. Other units of power include [[erg]]s per second (erg/s), [[horsepower]] (hp), [[horsepower#PS|metric horsepower]] (Pferdest\u00e4rke (PS) or cheval vapeur (CV)), and [[foot-pound force|foot-pounds]] per minute. One horsepower is equivalent to 33,000 [[Foot-pound (energy)|foot-pound]]s per minute, or the power required to lift 550 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] by one foot in one second, and is equivalent to about 746 watts. Other units include [[dBm]], a relative logarithmic measure with 1 milliwatt as reference; food [[calorie]]s per hour (often referred to as [[kilocalorie]]s per hour); [[Btu]] per hour (Btu/h); and [[refrigeration ton|tons of refrigeration]] (12,000 Btu/h).\n\n== Equations for power==\nPower, as a function of time, is the rate at which work is done, so can be expressed by this equation:\n\n:<math>P(t)=\\frac{W}{t}</math>\n\nBecause work is a [[force]] applied over a distance, this can be rewritten as:\n\n:<math>P(t)=\\frac{W}{t}=\\frac{\\bold{F}\\cdot \\bold{d}}{t}</math>\n\nAnd with distance per unit time being a velocity, power can likewise be understood as:\n\n:<math>P(t) = \\bold{F}\\cdot \\bold{v}</math>\n\nKnowing from [[Newton's_laws_of_motion#Newton.27s_second_law|Newton's 2nd Law]] that force is mass times acceleration, the expression for power can also be written as:\n\n:<math>P(t)=m\\bold{a}\\cdot \\bold{v}</math>\n\nPower will change over time as velocity changes due to acceleration.  Knowing that acceleration is the time rate of change of velocity, this can then be written:\n\n:<math>P(t)=m\\bold{v}\\cdot \\frac{d \\bold{v}}{dt}</math>\n\nComparing with the equation for [[kinetic energy]]:\n\n:<math>E_\\text{k} =\\tfrac{1}{2} mv^2 </math>\n\nIt can be seen from the previous equation that power is mass times a velocity term times another velocity term divided by time.  This shows how power is an amount of energy consumed per unit time.\n\n==Average power==\nAs a simple example, burning a kilogram of [[coal]] releases much more energy than does detonating a kilogram of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]],<ref>Burning coal produces around 15-30 [[megajoule]]s per kilogram, while detonating TNT produces about 4.7 megajoules per kilogram. For the coal value, see {{cite web | last = Fisher | first = Juliya | title = Energy Density of Coal | work = The Physics Factbook | url = http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/JuliyaFisher.shtml|year=2003|accessdate =30 May 2011}} For the TNT value, see the article [[TNT equivalent]]. Neither value includes the weight of oxygen from the air used during combustion.</ref> but because the TNT reaction releases energy much more quickly, it delivers far more power than the coal.\nIf \u0394''W''  is the amount of [[mechanical work|work]] performed during a period of [[time]] of duration \u0394''t'', the '''average power''' ''P''<sub>avg</sub> over that period is given by the formula\n:<math>\nP_\\mathrm{avg} = \\frac{\\Delta W}{\\Delta t}\\,.\n</math>\nIt is the average amount of work done or energy converted per unit of time. The average power  is often simply called \"power\" when the context makes it clear.\n\nThe '''instantaneous power''' is then the limiting value of the average power as the time interval \u0394''t'' approaches zero.\n:<math>\nP = \\lim _{\\Delta t\\rightarrow 0} P_\\mathrm{avg} = \\lim _{\\Delta t\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\Delta W}{\\Delta t} =  \\frac{\\mathrm{d}W}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\,.\n</math>\n\nIn the case of constant power ''P'', the amount of work performed during a period of duration ''T'' is given by:\n:<math>\nW = Pt\\,.\n</math>\n\nIn the context of energy conversion, it is more customary to use the symbol ''E'' rather than ''W''.\n\n==Mechanical power==\n[[File:Horsepower plain.svg|thumb|One ''metric horsepower'' is needed to lift 75&nbsp;[[:en:Kilogram|kilograms]] by 1&nbsp;[[meter]] in 1&nbsp;[[second]].]]\nPower in mechanical systems is the combination of forces and movement. In particular, power is the product of a force on an object and the object's velocity, or the product of a torque on a shaft and the shaft's angular velocity.\n\nMechanical power is also described as the time derivative of work.  In [[mechanics]], the [[mechanical work|work]] done by a force '''F''' on an object that travels along a curve ''C'' is given by the [[line integral]]:\n: <math>W_C = \\int_{C}\\bold{F}\\cdot \\bold{v}\\,\\mathrm{d}t =\\int_{C} \\bold{F} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\bold{x},</math>\nwhere '''x''' defines the path ''C'' and '''v''' is the velocity along this path.\n\nIf the force '''F''' is derivable from a potential ([[Conservative force|conservative]]), then applying the [[gradient theorem]] (and remembering that force is the negative of the [[gradient]] of the potential energy) yields:\n\n:<math>W_C = U(B)-U(A),</math>\n\nwhere ''A'' and ''B'' are the beginning and end of the path along which the work was done.\n\nThe power at any point along the curve ''C'' is the time derivative\n\n:<math>P(t) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}W}{\\mathrm{d}t}=\\bold{F}\\cdot \\bold{v}=-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}t}.</math>\n\nIn one dimension, this can be simplified to:\n\n:<math>P(t) = F\\cdot v.</math>\n\nIn rotational systems, power is the product of the [[torque]] <var>\u03c4</var> and [[angular velocity]] <var>\u03c9</var>,\n:<math>P(t) = \\boldsymbol{\\tau} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\omega}, \\,</math>\nwhere '''\u03c9''' measured in radians per second.  The <math> \\cdot </math> represents [[scalar product]].\n\nIn fluid power systems such as hydraulic actuators, power is given by\n:<math> P(t) = pQ, \\!</math>\nwhere ''p'' is [[pressure]] in [[pascal (unit)|pascals]], or N/m<sup>2</sup> and ''Q'' is [[volumetric flow rate]] in m<sup>3</sup>/s in SI units.\n\n===Mechanical advantage===\nIf a mechanical system has no losses, then the input power must equal the output power. This provides a simple formula for the [[mechanical advantage]] of the system.\n\nLet the input power to a device be a force ''F<sub>A</sub>'' acting on a point that moves with velocity ''v<sub>A</sub>'' and the output power be a force ''F<sub>B</sub>'' acts on a point that moves with velocity ''v<sub>B</sub>''.  If there are no losses in the system, then\n:<math>P = F_B v_B = F_A v_A, \\!</math>\nand the [[mechanical advantage]] of the system (output force per input force) is given by\n: <math> \\mathrm{MA} = \\frac{F_B}{F_A} = \\frac{v_A}{v_B}. </math>\n\nThe similar relationship is obtained for rotating systems, where ''T<sub>A</sub>'' and ''\u03c9<sub>A</sub>'' are the torque and angular velocity of the input and  ''T<sub>B</sub>'' and ''\u03c9<sub>B</sub>'' are the torque and angular velocity of the output.  If there are no losses in the system, then\n:<math>P = T_A \\omega_A = T_B \\omega_B, \\!</math>\nwhich yields the [[mechanical advantage]]\n:<math> \\mathrm{MA} = \\frac{T_B}{T_A} = \\frac{\\omega_A}{\\omega_B}.</math>\n\nThese relations are important because they define the maximum performance of a device in terms of [[velocity ratio]]s determined by its physical dimensions.  See for example [[gear ratio]]s.\n\n==Electrical power==\n[[File:Ansel Adams - National Archives 79-AAB-02.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Ansel Adams photograph of electrical wires of the Boulder Dam Power Units|[[Ansel Adams]] photograph of electrical wires of the Boulder Dam Power Units, 1941\u20131942]]\n{{main|Electric power}}\nThe instantaneous electrical power ''P'' delivered to a component is given by\n:<math>\nP(t) = I(t) \\cdot V(t) \\,\n</math>\n\nwhere \n:''P''(''t'') is the instantaneous power, measured in [[watt]]s ([[joule]]s per [[second]])\n:''V''(''t'') is the [[potential difference]] (or voltage drop) across the component, measured in [[volt]]s\n:''I''(''t'') is the [[Electric current|current]] through it, measured in [[ampere]]s\n\nIf the component is a [[resistor]] with time-invariant [[voltage]] to [[electric current|current]] ratio, then:\n:<math>\nP=I \\cdot V = I^2 \\cdot R = \\frac{V^2}{R} \\,\n</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>\nR = \\frac{V}{I} \\,\n</math>\nis the [[electrical resistance|resistance]], measured in [[ohm]]s.\n\n==Peak power and duty cycle==\n[[File:peak-power-average-power-tau-T.png|right|thumb|right|In a train of identical pulses, the instantaneous power is a periodic function of time. The ratio of the pulse duration to the period is equal to the ratio of the average power to the peak power. It is also called the duty cycle (see text for definitions).]]\n\nIn the case of a periodic signal <math>s(t)</math> of period <math>T</math>, like a train of identical pulses, the instantaneous power <math>p(t) = |s(t)|^2</math> is also a periodic function of period <math>T</math>.  The ''peak power'' is simply defined by:\n:<math>\nP_0 = \\max [p(t)]\n</math>.\n\nThe peak power is not always readily measurable, however, and the measurement of the average power <math>P_\\mathrm{avg}</math> is more commonly performed by an instrument.  If one defines the energy per pulse as:\n:<math>\n\\epsilon_\\mathrm{pulse} = \\int_{0}^{T}p(t) \\mathrm{d}t \\,\n</math>\nthen the average power is:\n:<math>\nP_\\mathrm{avg} = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T}p(t) \\mathrm{d}t = \\frac{\\epsilon_\\mathrm{pulse}}{T} \\,\n</math>.\n\nOne may define the pulse length <math>\\tau</math> such that <math>P_0\\tau = \\epsilon_\\mathrm{pulse}</math> so that the ratios\n:<math>\n\\frac{P_\\mathrm{avg}}{P_0} = \\frac{\\tau}{T} \\,\n</math>\n\nare equal. These ratios are called the ''duty cycle'' of the pulse train.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Simple machines]]\n* [[Mechanical advantage]]\n* [[Motive power]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude (power)]]\n* [[Pulsed power]]\n* [[Intensity (physics)|Intensity]] \u2014 in the radiative sense, power per area\n* [[Power gain]] \u2014 for linear, two-port networks.\n* [[Power density]]\n* [[Signal strength]]\n* [[Sound power]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{Classical mechanics derived SI units}}\n\n[[Category:Concepts in physics]]\n[[Category:Power (physics)| ]]"}]}}}}
