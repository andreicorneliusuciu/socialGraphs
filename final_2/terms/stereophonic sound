This is usually achieved by using two or more independent [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] channels through a configuration of two or more [[loudspeaker]]s (or stereo [[headphones]]) in such a way as to create the impression of sound heard from various directions, as in natural hearing.<ref>stereo. (n.d.). \u00a9 Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc.. Retrieved March 10, 2012, from Dictionary.com website: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stereo</ref> Thus the term \"stereophonic\" applies to so-called \"[[quadraphonic]]\" and \"[[surround sound|surround-sound]]\" systems as well as the more common two-channel, two-speaker systems. It is often contrasted with [[monaural|monophonic]], or \"mono\" sound, where audio is heard as coming from one position, often centered in the sound field (analogous to a [[visual field]]). In the 2000s, stereo sound is common in entertainment systems such as broadcast radio and TV, recorded music and the cinema.\n\nThe word ''stereophonic'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \"\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2\" (''stereos''), \"firm, solid\"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dstereo%2Fs \u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2],\nHenry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> + \"\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03ae\" (''ph\u014dn\u0113''), \"sound, tone, voice\"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfwnh%2F \u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03ae], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> and it was coined in 1927 by [[Western Electric]], by analogy with the word \"[[stereoscopic]]\".\n\n[[File:What is stereophonic effect.png|alt=Mechanism for stereophonic & duophonic sound.

It is an electronic simulation of sound-location-perception.\nThe main-diagram shows the situation in nature (simplified drawing), and the inset-image shows the electronic simulation. Notably, such audio systems need more-than-1 speakers.\n|thumb|250px]]\n\n==Description==\nStereo sound systems can be divided into two forms: The first is \"true\" or \"natural\" stereo in which a live sound is captured, with any natural reverberation or ambience present, by an array of [[microphone]]s. The signal is then reproduced over multiple loudspeakers to recreate, as closely as possible, the live sound.\n\nSecondly \"artificial\" or \"pan-pot\" stereo, in which a single-channel (mono) sound is reproduced over multiple loudspeakers. By varying the relative amplitude of the signal sent to each speaker an artificial direction (relative to the listener) can be suggested. The control which is used to vary this relative amplitude of the signal is known as a \"pan-pot\" (panoramic potentiometer). By combining multiple \"pan-potted\" mono signals together, a complete, yet entirely artificial, sound field can be created.\n\nIn technical usage, '''true stereo''' means sound recording and sound reproduction that uses [[stereographic projection]] to encode the relative positions of objects and events recorded.\n\nDuring two-channel stereo recording, two [[microphones]] are placed in strategically chosen locations relative to the sound source, with both recording simultaneously. The two recorded channels will be similar, but each will have distinct time-of-arrival and sound-pressure-level information. During playback, the listener's brain uses those subtle differences in timing and sound level to [[triangulation|triangulate]] the positions of the recorded objects. Stereo recordings often cannot be played on monaural systems without a significant loss of [[High fidelity|fidelity]]. Since each microphone records each [[wavefront]] at a slightly different time, the wavefronts are out of [[Phase (waves)|phase]]; as a result, constructive and destructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] can occur if both tracks are played back on the same speaker. This [[Physical phenomenon|phenomenon]] is known as [[phase cancellation]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early work===\n[[File:Theatrophone - Clement Ader 1881.JPG|thumb|left|Diagram of Cl\u00e9ment Ader's [[th\u00e9atrophone]] prototype at the Opera during the World Exhibition in Paris (1881).]]\n[[Cl\u00e9ment Ader]] demonstrated the first two-channel audio system in Paris in 1881, with a series of telephone transmitters connected from the stage of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera]] to a suite of rooms at the Paris Electrical Exhibition, where listeners could hear a live transmission of performances through receivers for each ear. ''[[Scientific American]]'' reported:\n:\"Every one who has been fortunate enough to hear the telephones at the Palais de l'Industrie has remarked that, in listening with both ears at the two telephones, the sound takes a special character of relief and localization which a single receiver cannot produce.... This phenomenon is very curious, it approximates to the theory of binauricular audition, and has never been applied, we believe, before to produce this remarkable illusion to which may almost be given the name of auditive perspective.\"<ref>Early Radio History.

The sound reproduction systems of the early \"talkies\" invariably only had a single set of speakers - which could lead to the somewhat disconcerting effect of the actor being on one side of the screen whilst his voice appeared to come from the other. Blumlein declared to his wife that he had found a way to make the sound follow the actor across the screen.\n\nThe genesis of these ideas is uncertain, but he explained them to [[Isaac Shoenberg]] in the late summer of 1931. His earliest notes on the subject are dated 25 September 1931, and his patent had the title \"Improvements in and relating to Sound-transmission, Sound-recording and Sound-reproducing Systems\". The application was dated 14 December 1931, and was accepted on 14 June 1933 as [[United Kingdom|UK]] patent number 394,325.<ref>{{Cite patent | country=GB|number=394325|title=Improvements in and relating to Sound-transmission, Sound-recording and Sound-reproducing Systems.|status=patent|gdate=1933-06-14|fdate=1931-12-14|pridate=1932-11-10|inventor=Alan Dower Blumlein|invent1=Blumlein, Alan Dower|assign1=Alan Dower Blumlein|assign2=Musical Industries, Limited|class=H04R1/40B; H04R11/12; H04R9/16; H04S1/00}}</ref>\n\nThe patent covered many ideas in stereo, some of which are used today and some not. Some 70 claims include:\n\n* A \"shuffling\" circuit, which aimed to preserve the directional effect when sound from a spaced pair of microphones was reproduced via stereo headphones instead of a pair of loudspeakers;\n* The use of a coincident pair of velocity microphones with their axes at right angles to each other, which is still known as a \"[[Blumlein Pair]]\";\n* Recording two channels in the single groove of a record using the two groove walls at right angles to each other and 45 degrees to the vertical;\n* A stereo disc-cutting head;\n* Using hybrid transformers to matrix between left and right signals and sum and difference signals;\n\nBlumlein began binaural experiments as early as 1933, and the first stereo discs were cut later the same year, twenty-five years before that method became the standard for stereo phonograph discs. These discs used the two walls of the groove at right angles in order to carry the two channels.\n\nMuch of the development work on this system for cinematic use did not reach completion until 1935. In Blumlein's short test films (most notably, \"Trains At Hayes Station\", which lasts 5 minutes 11 seconds, and, \"The Walking & Talking Film\"), his original intent of having the sound follow the actor was fully realised.<ref>Robert Alexander (2013). \"The Inventor of Stereo: The Life and Works of Alan Dower Blumlein\". p. 83.

One of the techniques investigated was the \"wall of sound\", which used an enormous array of microphones hung in a line across the front of an orchestra. Up to 80 microphones were used, and each fed a corresponding loudspeaker, placed in an identical position, in a separate listening room. Several stereophonic test recordings, using two microphones connected to two styli cutting two separate grooves on the same wax disc, were made with [[Leopold Stokowski]] and the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] at Philadelphia's [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]] in March 1932. The first (made on March 12, 1932), of [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin's]] ''[[Prometheus: Poem of Fire]]'', is the earliest known surviving intentional stereo recording.<ref>Fox, Barry ).

[[Leopold Stokowski]], normally the orchestra's conductor, was present in Constitution Hall to control the sound mix. Five years later, the same system would be expanded onto multi-channel film recording and used from the concert hall in Philadelphia to the recording labs at Bell Labs in New Jersey in order to record [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940) in what Disney called [[Fantasound]].\n[[File:Bell telephone magazine (1922) (14569926537).jpg|thumb|Bell Labs demonstration of stereo at World's Fair]]\n\nLater that same year, Bell Labs also demonstrated binaural sound, at the [[Century of Progress|Chicago World's Fair]] in 1933 using a dummy with microphones instead of ears, .<ref>B.B.

Synchronization was achieved by making the recordings in the form of three motion picture soundtracks recorded on a single piece of film with a fourth track being used to regulate volume expansion.\n\nThis was necessary due to the limitations of dynamic range on optical motion picture film of the period, however the volume compression and expansion were not fully automatic, but were designed to allow manual studio \"enhancement\"; i.e., the artistic adjustment of overall volume and the relative volume of each track in relation to the others. Stokowski, who was always interested in sound reproduction technology personally participated in the \"enhancement\" of the sound at the demonstration.\n\nThe speakers produced sound levels of up to 100 decibels, and the demonstration held the audience \"spellbound, and at times not a little terrified\", according to one report.<ref>\"Sound Waves 'Rock' Carnegie Hall as 'Enhanced Music' is Played\", ''The New York Times'', April 10, 1940, p. 25.</ref> [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], who was present at the demonstration, commented that it was \"marvellous\" but \"somehow unmusical because of the loudness.\" \"Take that ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]''\", he said. \"I didn't know what it was until they got well into the piece.

One track was used for dialogue, two for music, and one for sound effects. The purpose for this form of multitrack recording was to make mixing down to a single optical track easier and was not intended to be a recording for stereophonic purposes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The very first two-track recording MGM made (although released in mono) was \"It Never Rains But What It Pours\" by [[Judy Garland]], recorded on June 21, 1938, for the movie ''Love Finds Andy Hardy''.\n\n===Fantasound===\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Bill garity disney.jpg|thumb|left|The chief sound engineer, [[William Garity]], for [[Disney]]'s 1940 film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.]] -->\n[[Walt Disney]] began experimenting with multi-channel sound in the early 1930s as noted above.<ref>T.

Journal odf {{Clarify|date=January 2015}} the SMPE Vol 37 August 1941</ref> The film was not a financial success, however, and after two months of road-show exhibition in selected cities, its soundtrack was remixed into mono sound for general release. It was not until its 1956 re-release that stereo sound was restored to the film. In the early 1940s, composer-conductor [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]] directed the construction of a sound stage equipped for multichannel recording for 20th Century Fox studios. Several soundtracks from this era still exist in their multichannel elements, some of which have been released on DVD, including ''[[How Green Was My Valley (film)|How Green Was My Valley]]'', ''[[Anna and the King of Siam (film)|Anna and the King of Siam]]'', ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' and ''[[Sun Valley Serenade]]'' which, along with ''Orchestra Wives'', feature the only stereophonic recordings of the [[Glenn Miller]] Orchestra as it was during its heyday of the [[Swing Era]].\n\n===Cinerama===\nMotion picture theatres, however, are where the real introduction of stereophonic sound to the public occurred. Amid great fanfare, Stereo sound was officially proven commercially viable for the public on September 30, 1952 with the release of a [[Cinerama]] demonstration film by [[Lowell Thomas]] and [[Mike Todd]] entitled ''[[This is Cinerama]]''. The format was a spectacular widescreen process featuring three separate 35mm motion picture films (plus a separate sound film) running in synchronization with one another at 26 fps, adding one picture panel each to the viewer's left and right at 45 degree angles, in addition to the usual front and center panel, creating a truly immersive panoramic visual experience, comparable in some ways to today's curved screen [[IMAX|IMAX OMNI]].\n\nSimilarly, the [[Cinerama]] audio soundtrack technology, developed by [[Hazard E. Reeves]], a pioneer in magnetic recording, utilized seven discrete sound tracks on full-coat magnetic 35mm film, in order to envelop the theatregoer in an aural experience just as spectacular as that playing on the screen: five main channels behind the screen, two surround channels in the rear of the theater, plus a sync-track to interlock the 4 machines, which were specially outfitted with  aircraft servo-motors made by [[Ampex]].\n\nThe advent of multi-track magnetic tape and film recording made high fidelity synchronized multichannel recording more technically straightforward, though costly. By the early 1950s, all of the major studios were recording on 35mm magnetic film for mixing purposes, and many of these so-called individual angles still survive, allowing for soundtracks to be remixed into Stereo or even Surround.\n\nIn April 1953, while ''This is Cinerama'' was still playing only in New York City, most moviegoing audiences heard stereophonic sound for the first time with ''[[House of Wax (1953 film)|House of Wax]]'', an early [[3-D film]] starring [[Vincent Price]] and produced by Warner Bros. Unlike the 4-track mag release-print stereo films of the period which featured four thin strips of magnetic material running down the length of the film, inside and outside the sprocket holes, the sound system developed for ''House of Wax'', dubbed WarnerPhonic, was a combination of a 35&nbsp;mm [[magnetic film|fully coated]] magnetic film  that contained the audio tracks for Left-Center-Right, interlocked with the two dual-strip [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] system projectors, one of which carried a mono optical surround track and one that carried a mono backup track, should anything go wrong.\n\nOnly two other films featured this strange hybrid WarnerPhonic sound: the 3-D production of ''The Charge at Feather River'', and ''Island in the Sky''. Unfortunately, as of 2012, the stereo magnetic tracks to both these films are considered lost forever. In addition, a large percentage of 3-D films carried variations on three-track magnetic sound: ''[[It Came from Outer Space]]''; ''I, the Jury''; ''The Stranger Wore a Gun''; ''Inferno''; ''[[Kiss Me, Kate (film)|Kiss Me, Kate]]''; and many others.\n\n===Widescreen===\nInspired by [[Cinerama]], the movie industry moved quickly to create simpler and cheaper widescreen systems, the first of which, Todd-AO, was developed by Broadway promoter Michael Todd with financial backing from Rodgers and Hammerstein, to use a single 70mm film running at 30 frames per second with 6 magnetic sound tracks, for their screen presentation of \"Oklahoma!\". Major Hollywood studios immediately rushed to create their own unique formats, such as [[Warner Bros.]] [[Panavision]], [[Paramount Pictures]]' [[VistaVision]] and [[Twentieth Century Fox|Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation]]'s [[CinemaScope]], the latter of which used up to four separate magnetic sound tracks.\n\nBecause of the standard 35&nbsp;mm-size film, CinemaScope and its stereophonic sound was capable of being retrofitted into existing theaters. [[CinemaScope 55]] was created by the same company in order to use a larger form of the system (55&nbsp;mm instead of 35&nbsp;mm) to allow for greater image clarity onscreen, and was supposed to have had 6-track stereo instead of four. However, because the film needed a new, specially designed projector, the system proved impractical, and the two films made in the process, ''[[Carousel (film)|Carousel]]'' and ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'', were released in 35&nbsp;mm CinemaScope reduction prints. To compensate, the premiere engagement of ''Carousel'' used a six-track magnetic full-coat in an interlock, and a 1961 re-release of ''The King and I'', featured the film \"printed down\" to [[70 mm]], used a six-track stereo soundtrack as well.\n\nEventually, 50 complete sets of combination 55/35&nbsp;mm projectors and \"penthouse\" reproducers were completed and delivered by Century and Ampex, respectively, and 55&nbsp;mm release print sounding equipment was delivered by Western Electric. Several samples of 55&nbsp;mm sound prints can be found in the Sponable Collection at the Film and Television Archives at [[Columbia University]]. The subsequently abandoned 55/35&nbsp;mm Century projector eventually became the Century JJ 70/35MM projector.\n\n===Todd-AO===\nAfter this disappointing experience with their proprietary \"wide gauge\" system, Fox purchased the Todd-AO system and re-engineered it into a more modern 24 fps system with brand-new 65MM self-blimped production cameras (Mitchell BFC ... \"Blimped Fox Camera\") and brand-new 65MM MOS cameras (Mitchell FC ... \"Fox Camera\") and brand-new Super Baltar lenses in a wide variety of focal lengths, first employed on [[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]. Essentially, although Todd-AO was also available to others, the format became Fox's premier origination and presentation apparatus, replacing CinemaScope 55. Current DVDs of the two CinemaScope 55 feature titles were transferred from the original 55mm negatives, often including the separate 35MM films as extras for comparison.\n\n===Back to mono===\nHowever, beginning in 1957, films recorded in stereo (except for those shown in Cinerama or Todd-AO) carried an alternate mono track for theatres not ready or willing to re-equip for stereo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/wingcs5.htm |title=The CinemaScope Wing 5 |publisher=Widescreen Museum |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}</ref> From then until about 1975, when [[Dolby Stereo]] was used for the first time in films, most motion pictures\u2014even some from which stereophonic soundtrack albums were made, such as [[Zeffirelli]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]''\u2014were still released in monaural sound,<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063518/</ref> stereo being reserved almost exclusively for expensive musicals such as ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'',<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055614/</ref> ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'',<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058385/</ref> or ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'';<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061439/</ref> epics such as ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052618/</ref> or ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]''.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056937/</ref> Stereo was also reserved for dramas with a strong reliance on sound effects or music, such as ''[[The Graduate]]'',<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061722/</ref> with its [[Simon and Garfunkel]] score.\n\n===Dolby Stereo===\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2014}}\n{{main|Dolby Stereo}}\nToday, virtually all films are released in stereophonic sound as the Westrex Stereo Variable-Area system developed in 1977 for ''Star Wars'' is no more expensive to manufacture than mono. The format employs the same Western Electric/Westrex/Nuoptix RA-1231 recorder, and coupled with QS quadraphonic matrixing technology licensed to Dolby Labs from Sansui, this SVA system can produce the same Left, Center, Right and Surround sound of the original CinemaScope system of 1953 by using a single standard width optical track. This important development finally brought stereo sound to so-called Flat (Non-Wide-Screen) films presented at the most common aspect ratio of 1.85:1 although a number of `flat' films are photographed and presented at a ratio of 1.66:1, common in Europe or 1.75:1 common in museums.\n\nProducers often took advantage of the six magnetic soundtracks available for [[70mm film]] release prints, and productions shot in either 65MM or to save money, in 35MM and then blown up to 70MM.  In these instances, the 70MM prints would be mixed for stereo, while the 35MM reduction prints would be remixed for mono.\n\nSome films shot in 35MM, such as ''Camelot'', featured four-track stereophonic sound and were then \"blown-up\" to 70MM so that they could be shown on a giant screen with six-track stereophonic sound. Unfortunately however, many of these presentations were only pseudo stereo, utilizing a somewhat artificial six-track panning method. A process known somewhat derogatorily as the \"Columbia Spread\" was often used to synthesize Left Center and Right Center from a combination of Left and Center and Right and Center, respectively, or, for effects, the effect could be \"panned\" anywhere across the five stage speakers using a one-in/five-out pan pot.\n\nDolby Stereo was succeeded by [[Dolby Digital]] 5.1 in the cinema and more recently with the introduction of [[digital cinema]], [[Dolby Surround 7.1]] and [[Dolby Atmos]] in 2010 and 2012 respectively.\n\n==Modern home audio and video==\nFrom 1940 to 1970, the progress of stereophonic sound was paced by the technical difficulties of recording and reproducing two or more channels in synchronization with one another and by the economic and marketing issues of introducing new audio media and equipment. A stereo system cost roughly twice as much as a monophonic system, since a stereo system had to be assembled by the user after purchasing two preamplifiers, two amplifiers, and two speaker systems in addition to purchasing a twin-tuner radio, upgrading their tape recorder to a stereo model and having their phonograph fitted with a stereo cartridge. In the early days it was not clear whether consumers would think the sound was so much better as to be worth twice the price.\n\n==Stereo experiments on disc==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\n\n===Early lateral, vertical and double-sided stereo===\n\nEdison had been recording in a hill-and-dale or vertically modulated format on his cylinders and discs since 1877, and Berliner had been recording in a side-to-side or lateral format since shortly thereafter. Each format developed on its own trajectory until the late 1920s when electric recording on disc, utilizing  a microphone surpassed acoustic recording where the performer needed to shout or play very loudly into what basically amounted to a megaphone in reverse.\n\nAt that time, AM radio had been around for roughly a decade, and broadcasters were looking for both better materials from which to make phonograph records as well as a better format in which to record them to play over the narrow and thus inherently noisy radio channel. As radio had been playing the same shellac discs available to the public, it was found that, even though the playback system was now electric rather than acoustic, the surface noise on the disc would mask the music after just a few plays.\n\nThe development of acetate, bakelite, and vinyl, and the production of radio broadcast transcriptions helped to solve this.\nOnce these considerably more quiet compounds were developed, it was discovered that the rubber-idler-wheel driven turntables of the period had a great deal of low-frequency rumble - but only in the lateral plane. So, even though with all other factors being equal, the lateral plane of recording on disc had the higher fidelity, it was decided to record vertically to produce higher-fidelity recordings on these new `silent-surface' materials, for two reasons, the increase in fidelity and the incompatibility with home phonographs which, with their lateral-only playback systems would only produce silence from a vertically modulated disc.\n\nAfter 33-1/3 RPM recording had been perfected for the movies in 1927, the speed of radio program transcriptions was reduced to match, once again to inhibit playback of the discs on normal home consumer equipment. Even though the stylus size remained the same as consumer records at either 3 mils or 2.7 mils, the disc size was increased from 12-inches to the same 16-inches as those used in early talking pictures in order to prevent the practice even further. Now, not only could the records not be played on home equipment due to incompatible recording format and speed, they wouldn't even fit on the player either, which suited the copyright holders.\n\n===Two-channel high fidelity and other experiments===\n\nDuring the same period engineers got a bright idea. Split the signal into two parts, bass and treble, and record the treble on its own track near the edge of the disc in a lateral format so that there would be no high-frequency distortion, and then record the bass on its own track in a vertical fashion to get rid of the rumble. Unfortunately, vertical grooves take up more space than lateral grooves; so when the bass track was full, starting halfway through the disc and ending up at the center, the treble track had a large amount of unused space at the end. The alternative was to record it at a wider pitch i.e. lines-per-inch in order to match up with the bass track and keep both styli in the same place, limiting the playing time to slightly longer than a single even at 33-1/3 RPM on a 12-inch disc.\n\nAnother failed experiment in the late 1920s and early '30s involved recording the left channel on the left side of the disc (when held vertically with its edge facing the user) and recording the right channel on the right side of the disc. These were manufactured on twin film-company recording lathes which ran in perfect sync with one another with no variation, and were capable of not only outside-in as well as inside-out recordings (see Radio Programming Vinyl Sequence under [[Gramophone record]]) but also counter-clockwise as well as conventional clockwise recording by mounting the cutting head wrong-way-out with a special adapter. One master was recorded conventionally and the other was recorded counterclockwise, each master was run separately through the plating process, lined up to match, and subsequently mounted in a press. This recording method was later used to record counter-clockwise discs by Mattel for one of its answers to the GAF Talking [[View Master]] in the mid-60s.\n\nThe dual-sided stereo disc was then played vertically, first in a system that featured two tonearms on the same post facing one another, and later on in an offset system where one tonearm was placed conventionally and the other tonearm was placed opposite, i.e. not only on the other side of the mechanism, but facing the other way as well so that both tonearms could start at the edge and play to the center. But, even with playing the disc vertically in a rotating clamp, the same trouble was observed with keeping the two tonearms in their respective synchronous revolutions. The system was developed further however and adapted so that a single tonearm could play one side of a record or the other in jukeboxes of the late 1930s and early '40s.\n\nFive years later, Bell Labs was experimenting with a two-channel Lateral-Vertical system, where the left channel was recorded laterally and the right channel was recorded vertically, still utilizing a standard 3-mil 78-RPM groove, over three times larger than the modern LP stylus of the late 20th Century. The trouble with that was, once again, all the low-frequency rumble was in the left channel and all the high-frequency distortion was in the right channel. Over a quarter of a century later, it was decided to tilt the recording head 45 degrees off to the right side so that both the low frequency rumble and high frequency distortion were shared equally by both channels, producing the 45/45 system we know today.\n\n===Emory Cook===\n\nIn 1952, [[Emory Cook]] (1913\u20132002), who already had become famous by designing new feedback disk-cutter heads to improve sound from tape to vinyl, took the two-channel high-fidelity system described above and developed a somewhat misnamed \"binaural\" record out of it, which consisted of the same two separate channels cut into two separate groups of grooves running next to each other as described above, i.e. one running from the edge of the disc to halfway through and the other starting at the halfway point and ending up towards the label, but he used two ''lateral'' grooves with a 500&nbsp;Hz crossover in the inner track to try and compensate for the lower fidelity and high frequency distortion on the inner track.\n\nEach groove needed its own monophonic needle and cartridge on its own branch of tonearm, and each needle was connected to a separate amplifier and speaker. This setup was intended to give a demonstration at a New York audio fair of Cook's cutter heads rather than to sell the record; but soon afterward, the demand for such recordings and the equipment to play it grew, and Cook Records began to produce such records commercially. Cook recorded a vast array of sounds, ranging from railroad sounds to thunderstorms.<ref group=note>The term \"binaural\" that Cook used should not be confused with the modern use of the word, where \"binaural\" is an inner-ear recording using small microphones placed in the ear. Cook used conventional microphones, but used the same word, \"binaural\", that [[Alan Blumlein]] had used for his experimental stereo records almost 20 years earlier.</ref> By 1953, Cook had a catalog of about 25 stereo records for sale to [[audiophile]]s.<ref>\"[https://books.google.com/books?id=YgoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA15 Commercial Binaural Sound Not Far Off]\", ''Billboard'', Oct. 24, 1953, p. 15.</ref>\n\n==Magnetic tape recording==\nThe first stereo recordings using magnetic tape were made in [[Germany]] in the early 1940s using [[Magnetophon]] recorders. Around 300 recordings were made of various symphonies, most of which were seized by the [[Red Army]] at the end of [[World War II]]. The recordings were of relatively [[high fidelity]], thanks to the discovery of [[Tape bias|AC bias]]. A 1944 recording of [[Anton Bruckner]]'s Symphony No. 8 directed by [[Herbert von Karajan]] and the [[Orchester der Berliner Staatsoper]] and a 1944 or 1945 recording of [[Walter Gieseking]] playing [[Beethoven]]'s Piano Concerto No. 5 (with [[flak]] fire audible in the background) are the only recordings still known to exist.\n\nIn the US, stereo magnetic tape recording was demonstrated on standard 1/4-inch tape for the first time in 1952, using two sets of recording and playback heads, upside-down and offset from one another.<ref>\"[https://books.google.com/books?id=jNwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA216 Adventures in Sound]\", ''Popular Mechanics'', September 1952, p. 216.</ref> A year later, [[Remington Records]] began recording a number of its sessions in stereo, including performances by [[Thor Johnson]] and the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]].\n\nLater that same year, more experimental stereo recordings were conducted with [[Leopold Stokowski]] and a group of New York studio musicians at [[RCA Victor]] Studios in [[New York City]]. In February 1954, the label also recorded a performance of [[Berlioz]]' masterpiece The ''[[Damnation of Faust]]'' by the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] under the direction of [[Charles M\u00fcnch]], the success of which led to the practice of regularly recording sessions in stereo.\n\nShortly afterwards, RCA Victor recorded the last two [[Blue Network|NBC Radio]] broadcast concerts by famed conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] and the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]], on stereophonic magnetic tape, however they were never officially released, though they have long been available on pirated LPs and CDs. In the UK, [[Decca Records]] began recording sessions in stereo in mid-1954, and by that time even smaller labels in the U.S. such as  Concertapes, Bel Canto and Westminster along with major labels such as RCA Victor began releasing stereophonic recordings on two-track prerecorded reel-to-reel magnetic tape, priced at twice or three times the cost of monaural recordings, which retailed for around $2.95 to $3.95 apiece for a standard monaural LP. Even two-track monaural tape which had to be flipped over halfway through and carried exactly the same information as the monaural LP - but without the crackles and pops - were being sold for $6.95.<ref>\"[https://books.google.com/books?id=EBsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34 Tape Trade Group to Fix Standards]\", ''Billboard'', July 10, 1954, p. 34.</ref>\n\nOne has to understand that, in the United States, the average working man in 1954 might be taking home $50\u2013$60 a week if he was lucky and paying $75\u2013$100 a month in rent for his two-room apartment. Therefore, the price of a great deal of two-track stereo tape recordings of the period being upwards of $12.95-$18.95 apiece for a full-length album when the corresponding mono LP was only $3.95, would be prohibitive. In addition, the cost of the stereophonic recorder upon which to play them may have been equal to or greater than the cost of a new car.\n\nHowever, audiophiles, with little or no regard for the cost, bought them and the players anyway, and stereophonic sound came to at least a select few living rooms of the mid-1950s.<ref>\"Hi-Fi: Two-Channel Commotion\", ''The New York Times'', November 17, 1957, p.

With the supplied special turntables featuring a clear platter lighted from underneath to show off the color as well as the sound, the stunt worked even better for Bel Canto, whose roster of jazz, easy listening and [[lounge music]], pressed onto their trademark Caribbean-blue vinyl sold well throughout 1958 and early into 1959.\n\n===Affordable cartridges===\n\nWhen Audio Fidelity released its stereophonic demonstration disc, there was no affordable [[magnetic cartridge]] on the market capable of playing it. After the release of other demonstration discs and the respective libraries from which they were culled, the other spur to the popularity of stereo discs was the reduction in price of a stereo cartridge, for playing the disks, from $250 to $29.95 in June 1958.<ref>\"[https://books.google.com/books?id=txgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA36 Audio Fidelity Bombshell Had Industry Agog]\", ''Billboard'', Dec. 22, 1962, p. 36.</ref> The first four mass-produced stereophonic discs available to the buying public were released in March 1958\u2014''Johnny Puleo and his Harmonica Gang Volume 1'' (AFSD 5830), ''Railroad&nbsp;\u2013 Sounds of a Vanishing Era'' (AFSD 5843), ''Lionel&nbsp;\u2013 Lionel Hampton and his Orchestra'' (AFSD 5849) and ''Marching Along with the Dukes of Dixieland Volume 3'' (AFSD 5851).

In the 1980s, [[Satellite television|satellite]] delivery of both television and radio programs made this fairly tedious process of synchronization unnecessary. One of the last of these simulcast programs was ''[[Friday Night Videos]]'' on NBC, just before [[Multichannel television sound|MTS stereo]] was approved by the FCC.\n\nThe [[BBC]] made extensive use of [[simulcast]]ing between 1974 and around 1990. The first such transmission was in 1974, when the BBC broadcast a recording of Van Morrison's London Rainbow Concert simultaneously on BBC2 TV and Radio 2. After that it was used for many other music programmes, live and recorded, including the annual BBC [[The Proms|Promenade concerts]] and the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. The advent of [[NICAM]] stereo sound with TV rendered this unnecessary.\n\n[[Cable tv|Cable TV]] systems delivered many stereo programs utilizing this method for many years until prices for MTS stereo [[RF modulator|modulators]] dropped. One of the first stereo cable stations was [[The Movie Channel]], though the most popular cable TV station that drove up usage of stereo simulcasting was [[MTV]].\n\nJapanese television began multiplex (stereo) sound broadcasts in 1978,<ref name=\"Japan's Stereo TV System\">\"[http://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/16/business/japan-s-stereo-tv-system.html Japan's Stereo TV System]\", ''The New York Times'', June 16, 1984.</ref> and regular transmissions with stereo sound came in 1982.<ref>[http://www.terramedia.co.uk/Chronomedia/years/1982.htm Chronomedia: 1982].</ref> By 1984, about 12% of the programming, or about 14 or 15 hours per station per week, made use of the multiplex technology.

It was adopted by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] as the United States [[standardization|standard]] for stereo television [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] in 1984.\nSporadic network transmission of stereo audio began on NBC on July 26, 1984, with ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''\u2014although at the time, only the network's New York City flagship station, [[WNBC]], had stereo broadcast capability.<ref>Peter W. Kaplan, \"TV Notes\", ''New York Times'', July 28, 1984, sec. 1, p. 46.</ref> Regular stereo transmission of programs began in 1985.\n\n==Recording methods==\n\n===A-B technique: time-of-arrival stereophony===\n[[File:AB Stereo.svg|thumb|A-B stereo microphone placement.]]\nThis uses two parallel omnidirectional microphones some distance apart, capturing time-of-arrival stereo information as well as some level (amplitude) difference information\u2014especially if employed in close proximity to the sound source(s). At a distance of about {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the time delay (time-of-arrival difference) for a signal reaching the first microphone and then the other one from the side is approximately 1.5&nbsp;ms (1&nbsp;to&nbsp;2&nbsp;ms). If you increase the distance between the microphones, you effectively decrease the pickup angle. At a {{convert|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} distance, it is approximately equivalent to the pickup angle of the near-coincident ORTF setup.\n\nThis technique can produce phase issues when the stereo signal is mixed to mono.\n\n===X-Y technique: intensity stereophony===\n[[File:XY stereo.svg|thumb|X-Y stereo microphone placement.]]\nHere, two directional [[microphone]]s are at the same place, typically pointing at an angle between 90\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 to each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rycote.com/images/uploads/The_Stereophonic_Zoom.pdf |title=\"The Stereophonic Zoom\" by Michael Williams |format=PDF |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}</ref> The stereo effect is achieved through differences in sound pressure level between two microphones. A difference in levels of 18&nbsp;dB (16 to 20&nbsp;dB) is needed for hearing the direction of a loudspeaker. Due to the lack of differences in time-of-arrival/phase ambiguities, the sonic characteristic of X-Y recordings has less sense of space and depth when compared to recordings employing an A-B setup. When two figure-eight microphones are used, facing \u00b145\u00b0 with respect to the sound source, the X-Y setup is called a [[Blumlein Pair]]. The sonic image produced is realistic.\n\n===M/S technique: mid/side stereophony===\n[[File:MS stereo.svg|thumb|Mid-Side stereo microphone technique.]] This coincident technique employs a bidirectional microphone facing sideways and another microphone at an angle of 90\u00b0, facing the sound source. The second microphone is generally a variety of cardioid, although [[Alan Blumlein]] described the usage of an omnidirectional transducer in his original patent.\n\nThe left and right channels are produced through a simple matrix: Left = Mid + Side; Right = Mid \u2212 Side (the polarity-reversed side signal). This configuration produces a completely mono-compatible signal and, if the Mid and Side signals are recorded (rather than the matrixed Left and Right), the stereo width can be manipulated after the recording has taken place. This makes it especially useful for film-based projects.\n\n===Near-coincident technique: mixed stereophony===\n[[File:ORTF-Stereo.svg|thumb|left| [[ORTF]] stereo microphone technique.]] These techniques combine the principles of both [[AB Class amplifier|A-B]] and [[X-Y]] ([[coincident pair]]) techniques. For example, the [[ORTF stereo technique]] of the [[Office de Radiodiffusion T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Fran\u00e7aise]] ([[Radio France]]) calls for a pair of [[cardioid microphone]]s placed 17&nbsp;cm apart at a total angle between microphones of 110\u00b0, which results in a stereophonic pickup angle of 96\u00b0 (''[[Stereo Recording Angle]]'', or SRA).<ref>{{cite web|author=Eberhard Sengpiel |url=http://www.sengpielaudio.com/ |title=Forum f\u00fcr Mikrofonaufnahme und Tonstudiotechnik. Eberhard Sengpiel |publisher=Sengpielaudio.com |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}</ref> In the [[NOS stereo technique]] of the Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (Dutch Broadcasting Organisation), the total angle between microphones is 90\u00b0 and the distance is 30&nbsp;cm, thus capturing time-of-arrival stereo information as well as level information. It is noteworthy that all spaced microphone arrays and all near-coincident techniques use a spacing of at least 17&nbsp;cm or more. 17&nbsp;cm roughly equals the human ear distance and therefore provides the same interaural time difference (ITD) or more, depending on the spacing between microphones. Although the recorded signals are generally intended for playback over stereo loudspeakers, reproduction over headphones can provide remarkably good results, depending on the microphone arrangement.\n\n===Pseudo-stereo===\nIn the course of restoration or remastering of [[monaural|monophonic]] records, various techniques of \"pseudo-stereo\", \"quasi-stereo\", or \"rechanneled stereo\" have been used to create the impression that the sound was originally recorded in stereo. These techniques first involved hardware methods (see [[Duophonic]]) or, more recently, a combination of hardware and software.

Of these, [[binaural recording]] is analogous to [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic photography]]. In binaural recording, a pair of microphones is put inside a [[kunstkopf|model of a human head]] that includes external ears and ear canals; each microphone is where the [[eardrum]] would be.  The recording is then played back through headphones, so that each channel is presented independently, without mixing or crosstalk. Thus, each of the listener's eardrums is driven with a replica of the auditory signal it would have experienced at the recording location. The result is an accurate duplication of the [[auditory spatiality]] that would have been experienced by the listener had he or she been in the same place as the model head. Because of the inconvenience of wearing headphones, true binaural recordings have remained laboratory and audiophile curiosities.  However \"loudspeaker-binaural\" listening is possible with [[Ambiophonics]].\n\nNumerous early two-track-stereo reel-to-reel tapes as well as several experimental stereo disc formats of the early 1950s branded themselves as binaural, however they were merely different incarnations of the above-described stereo or two-track mono recording methods (lead vocal or instrument isolated on one channel and orchestra on the other sans lead.)\n\n==Playback==\nStereophonic sound attempts to create an illusion of location for various sound sources (voices, instruments, etc.) within the original recording. The recording engineer's goal is usually to create a stereo \"image\" with localization information. When a stereophonic recording is heard through loudspeaker systems (rather than headphones), each ear, of course, hears sound from both speakers. The audio engineer may, and often does, use more than two microphones (sometimes many more) and may mix them down to two tracks in ways that exaggerate the separation of the instruments, in order to compensate for the mixture that occurs when listening via speakers.\n\nDescriptions of stereophonic sound tend to stress the ability to localize the position of each instrument in space, but this would only be true in a carefully engineered and installed system, where speaker placement and room acoustics are taken into account.  In reality, many playback systems, such as all-in-one boombox units and the like, are incapable of recreating a realistic stereo image.  Originally, in the late 1950s and 1960s, stereophonic sound was marketed as seeming \"richer\" or \"fuller-sounding\" than monophonic sound, but these sorts of claims were and are highly subjective, and again, dependent on the equipment used to reproduce the sound.  In fact, poorly recorded or reproduced stereophonic sound can sound far worse than well done monophonic sound.  When playing back stereo recordings, the best results are obtained by using two identical speakers, in front of and equidistant from the listener, with the listener located on a center line between the two speakers.  In effect, an [[equilateral triangle]] is formed, with the angle between the two speakers around 60 degrees as seen from the listener's point of view.\n\n==Vinyl records==\n{{Tall image|Stereo Stack-A kaleidoscopic-wonderland of hi-fidelity and dual-dynamic vibrancy.jpg|250|500|alt=|A compilation of LP stereo banners|right}}\nAlthough Decca had recorded [[Ansermet]]'s conducting of [[Antar (Rimsky-Korsakov)|''Antar'']] in stereo May 1954 it took four years for the first stereo LPs to be sold.<ref>Grammy pulse - Volumes 2 \u00e0 3 - Page vi National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (U.S.) - 1984 \"After all, stereo sound was developed in 1931, but it took until 1958 for the first stereo LPs to be sold. Keeping in mind corporate and bureaucratic red tape, we could easily be in for a long haul before stereo TV is as natural as having two ears.\"</ref> In 1958, the first group of mass-produced stereo two-channel [[vinyl record]]s was issued, by Audio Fidelity in the USA and Pye in Britain, using the [[Westrex]] \"45/45\" single-groove system. Whereas the stylus moves horizontally when reproducing a monophonic disk recording, on stereo records, the stylus moves vertically as well as horizontally. One could envision a system in which the left channel was recorded laterally, as on a monophonic recording, with the right channel information recorded with a \"hill and dale\" vertical motion; such systems were proposed but not adopted, due to their incompatibility with existing phono pickup designs (see below).\n\nIn the Westrex system, each channel drives the cutting head at a 45-degree angle to the vertical. During playback, the combined signal is sensed by a left-channel coil mounted diagonally opposite the inner side of the groove and a right-channel coil mounted diagonally opposite the outer side of the groove.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vinylrecorder.com/stereo.html|title=Stereo disc recording|accessdate=October 4, 2006}}</ref>  The Westrex system provided for the polarity of one channel to be inverted: this way large groove displacement would occur in the horizontal plane and not in the vertical one.  The latter would require large up-and-down excursions and would encourage cartridge skipping during loud passages.\n\nThe combined stylus motion is, in terms of the vector, the sum and difference of the two stereo channels. Effectively, all horizontal stylus motion conveys the L+R sum signal, and vertical stylus motion carries the L\u2212R difference signal. The advantages of the 45/45 system are that it has greater compatibility with monophonic recording and playback systems.\n\nEven though a monophonic cartridge will technically reproduce an equal blend of the left and right channels, instead of reproducing only one channel, this was not recommended in the early days of stereo due to the larger stylus (1.0 mil vs 0.7 mil for stereo) coupled with the lack of vertical compliance of the mono cartridges available in the first ten years of stereo. These factors would result in the stylus ``digging into' the stereo vinyl and carving up the stereo portion of the groove, destroying it for subsequent playback on stereo cartridges. This is why one often notices the banner PLAY ONLY WITH STEREO CARTRIDGE AND STYLUS on stereo vinyl issued between 1958 and 1964.\n\nConversely, and with the benefit of no damage to any type of disc even from the beginning, a stereo cartridge reproduces the lateral grooves of monophonic recording equally through both channels, rather than through one channel. Also, it gives a more balanced sound, because the two channels have equal fidelity as opposed to providing one higher-fidelity laterally recorded channel and one lower-fidelity vertically recorded channel. Overall, this approach may give higher fidelity, because the \"difference\" signal is usually of low power, and is thus less affected by the intrinsic distortion of \"hill and dale\"-style recording.\n\nAdditionally, surface noise tends to be picked up in a greater capacity in the vertical channel, therefore a mono record played on a stereo system can be in worse shape than the same record in stereo and still be enjoyable. (See [[Gramophone record]] for more on lateral and vertical recording.)\n\nThis system was conceived by [[Alan Blumlein]] of [[EMI]] in 1931 and was patented in the U.K. the same year, but was not reduced to actual practice as was a requirement for patenting in the U.S. and elsewhere at that time. (Blumlein was killed in a plane crash while testing radar equipment during [[World War II|WW-II]], and he, therefore, never reduced the system to actual practice through ''both'' a recording ''and'' a reproducing means.) EMI cut the first stereo test discs using the system in 1933, but it was not applied commercially until a quarter of a century later, and by another company ([[Westrex]] division of [[Litton Industries]] Inc, as a successor to [[Western Electric]] Company), and dubbed StereoDisk. Stereo sound provides a more natural listening experience, since the spatial location of the source of a sound is (at least in part) reproduced.\n\nIn the 1960s, it was common practice to generate stereo versions of music from monophonic master tapes, which were normally marked \"electronically reprocessed\" or \"electronically enhanced\" stereo on track listings. These were generated by a variety of processing techniques to try to separate out various elements; this left noticeable and unsatisfactory artifacts in the sound, typically sounding \"phasey\".  However, as multichannel recording became increasingly available, it has become progressively easier to master or remaster more plausible stereo recordings out of the archived multitrack master tapes.\n\n==Compact disc==\nThe [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|Red Book CD]] specification includes two channels by default, and so a mono recording on CD either has one empty channel, or else the same signal being relayed to both channels simultaneously. However, noncommercial CDs in other formats such as White Book or Orange Book can feature up to four hours of stereo music on one CD for the purposes of extended programming in public spaces, such as malls.\n\nThese formats slightly reduce both the sampling frequency from 44.1&nbsp;kHz as well as the bit-depth frequency from 16-bit and employ other proprietary technologies in order to increase the time on the disc and, as in the 16-inch transcriptions above - render them unplayable on the vast majority of consumer equipment.\n\n==Broadcasting==\n\n===Radio===\n\nIn [[FM broadcasting]], the Zenith-GE pilot-tone stereo system is used throughout the world.\n\nBecause of the limited audio quality of the majority of AM receivers, and also because AM stereo receivers are relatively scarce, relatively few AM stations employ stereo. Various modulation schemes are used for [[AM stereo]], of which the best-known is [[Motorola]]'s [[C-QUAM]], the official method for most countries in the world that transmit in AM stereo. More AM stations are adopting digital [[HD Radio]], which allows the transmission of stereo sound on AM stations. For Digital Audio Broadcasting, [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II|MP2]] audio streams are used. DAB is one of the Digital Radio formats that is used to broadcast Digital Audio over terrestrial broadcast networks or satellite networks. DAB is extended to video, and the new format is called [[Digital Multimedia Broadcasting|DMB]].\n\nIn Sweden, [[Televerket (Sweden)|Televerket]] invented a different stereo broadcasting system called the ''Compander System''. It had a high level of channel separation and could even be used to broadcast two mono signals - for example for language studies (with two languages at the same time). But tuners and receivers with the pilot-tone system were sold so people in southern Sweden could listen to, for example, Danish radio. At last Sweden (the Televerket) decided to start broadcasting in stereo according to the pilot-tone system in 1977. But stereo radio was delayed in Sweden because of the two competing systems.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Television===\nFor analog TV (PAL and NTSC), various modulation schemes are used in different parts of the world to broadcast more than one sound channel. These are sometimes used to provide two mono sound channels that are in different languages, rather than stereo. [[Multichannel television sound]] is used mainly in the Americas. [[NICAM]] is widely used in Europe, except in Germany, where [[Zweikanalton]] is used. The EIAJ FM/FM subcarrier system is used in Japan. For [[Digital TV]], MP2 audio streams are widely used within MPEG-2 program streams. [[Dolby Digital]] is the audio standard used for Digital TV in North America, with the capability for anywhere between 1 and 6 discrete channels.\n\n==Common usage==\n[[File:2 0 channels (stereo) label.svg|thumb|upright|left|Label for 2.0 sound (stereo).]]\nIn common usage, a \"stereo\" is a two-channel sound reproduction system, and a \"stereo recording\" is a two-channel recording. This is cause for much confusion, since five (or more)-channel [[home cinema|home theater]] systems are not popularly described as \"stereo\".\n\nMost two-channel recordings are stereo recordings only in this weaker sense. Pop music, in particular, is usually recorded using [[close miking]] techniques, which artificially separate signals into several tracks. The individual tracks (of which there may be hundreds) are then \"mixed down\" into a two-channel recording. The audio engineers determine where each track will be placed in the stereo \"image\", by using various techniques that may vary from very simple (such as \"left-right\" [[panning (audio)|panning controls]]) to more sophisticated and extensively based on [[Psychoacoustics|psychoacoustic]] research (such as channel equalization, compression and [[Microphone practice#M/S technique: Mid/Side stereophony|mid-side processing]]). The end product using this process often bears little or no resemblance to the actual physical and spatial relationship of the musicians at the time of the original performance; indeed, it is not uncommon for different tracks of the same song to be recorded at different times (and even in different studios) and then mixed into a final two-channel recording for commercial release.\n\n[[European classical music|Classical music]] recordings are a notable exception. They are more likely to be recorded without having tracks dubbed in later as in pop recordings, so that the actual physical and [[:Media:Orchestra layout.svg|spatial relationship]] of the musicians at the time of the original performance can be preserved on the recording.\n\n==Balance==<!-- This section is linked from [[Balance]] -->\n'''Balance''' can mean the amount of signal from each channel reproduced in a stereo [[audio recording]]. Typically, a balance control in its center position will have 0 [[decibel|dB]] of gain for both channels and will attenuate one channel as the control is turned, leaving the other channel at 0&nbsp;dB.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rane.com/par-b.html#balance |title=Rane Professional Audio Reference Home |accessdate=January 20, 2008}}</ref>\n\n''See also [[Panning (audio)|Panning]]''.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col |2}}\n*[[3D audio effect]]\n*[[Acoustic location]]\n*[[Acoustic source localization]] \n*[[Ambisonics]]&nbsp;\u2013 generalized MS-Stereo to three dimensions\n*[[Crossfeed]]\n*[[Duophonic sound]]\n*[[Hi-fi]]\n*[[Joint stereo]]\n*[[Precedence effect]]\n*[[Psychoacoustics]]\n*[[Sound localization|Sound Localization]]\n*[[Stereo photography]]\n*[[Subwoofer]] (Stereo separation)\n*[[Sweet spot (acoustics)]]\n*[[Wave field synthesis]]&nbsp;\u2013 The physical reconstruction of the spatial sonic field\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{External links|date=June 2016}}\n{{commons category}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZrWHtvSog4 1-Minute Audio Test for Stereo Setup]\n*[http://www.audiocheck.net/audiotests_stereo.php Online Left/Right Stereo Test]\n*[http://www.audiocheck.net/audiotests_polaritycheck.php Online Stereo Polarity Test]\n*[http://www.sengpielaudio.com/Visualization-EBS-E.htm Visualization of All Stereo Microphone Systems with Two Microphones]\n*[http://www.syntheticwave.de/Two_Ears-Two_Loudspeakers.htm \"Two Ears- Two Loudspeakers?\" The limitations of traditional audio]\n*[http://www.regonaudio.com/Records%20and%20Reality.html Records and Reality]\n*[http://www.regonaudio.com/MICROPHONE%20THEORY%20word.htm Microphone Theory]\n*[http://www.regonaudio.com/Directional%20Hearing%20How%20to%20Listen%20to%20Stereo.htm Directional Hearing How to Listen to Stereo]\n*[http://www.regonaudio.com/What%20Can%20and%20Cannot%20be%20Expected%20from%20Stereo.html What Can and Cannot be Expected From Stereo]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stereophonic Sound}}\n[[Category:Stereophonic sound| ]]\n[[Category:Sound recording]]\n[[Category:Music technology]]"}]}}}}
