Specifically [[aerodynamics]] concerning the flow of air over bodies such as [[wing]]s or through objects such as [[wind tunnel]]s (see also [[lift (force)|lift]] and [[aeronautics]]).\n* [[Astrodynamics]]&nbsp;\u2013 the study of [[orbital mechanics]] including prediction of orbital elements when given a select few variables.  While few schools in the United States teach this at the undergraduate level, several have graduate programs covering this topic (usually in conjunction with the Physics department of said college or university).\n* [[Statics]] and [[Dynamics (physics)|Dynamics]] (engineering mechanics)&nbsp;\u2013 the study of movement, forces, moments in mechanical systems.\n* [[Mathematics]]&nbsp;\u2013 in particular, [[calculus]], [[differential equations]], and [[linear algebra]].\n* [[Electrotechnology]]&nbsp;\u2013 the study of [[electronics]] within engineering.\n* Propulsion&nbsp;\u2013 the energy to move a vehicle through the air (or in outer space) is provided by [[internal combustion engine]]s, [[jet engine]]s and [[turbomachinery]], or [[rocket]]s (see also [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] and [[spacecraft propulsion]]). A more recent addition to this module is [[electric propulsion]] and [[ion propulsion]].\n* [[Control engineering]]&nbsp;\u2013 the study of [[mathematical modeling]] of the [[Flight dynamics|dynamic]] behavior of systems and designing them, usually using feedback signals, so that their dynamic behavior is desirable (stable, without large excursions, with minimum error). This applies to the dynamic behavior of aircraft, spacecraft, propulsion systems, and subsystems that exist on aerospace vehicles.\n* [[Aircraft structures]]&nbsp;\u2013 design of the physical configuration of the craft to withstand the forces encountered during flight. Aerospace engineering aims to keep structures lightweight and low-cost, while maintaining structural integrity.<ref>{{Cite web |title = Aircraft Structures in Aerospace Engineering |url= http://aerospaceengineering.aero/aircraft-structures-in-aerospace-engineering/ |work= Aerospace Engineering, Aviation News, Salary, Jobs and Museums |accessdate= 2015-11-06 }}</ref>\n* [[Materials science]]&nbsp;\u2013 related to structures, aerospace engineering also studies the materials of which the aerospace structures are to be built. New materials with very specific properties are invented, or existing ones are modified to improve their performance.\n* [[Solid mechanics]]&nbsp;\u2013 Closely related to material science is solid mechanics which deals with stress and strain analysis of the components of the vehicle. Nowadays there are several Finite Element programs such as MSC Patran/Nastran which aid engineers in the analytical process.\n* [[Aeroelasticity]]&nbsp;\u2013 the interaction of aerodynamic forces and structural flexibility, potentially causing [[Aeroelastic flutter|flutter]], divergence, etc.\n* [[Avionics]]&nbsp;\u2013 the design and programming of [[computer systems]] on board an aircraft or spacecraft and the [[simulation]] of systems.\n* [[Software]]&nbsp;\u2013 the specification, design, development, test, and implementation of [[computer software]] for aerospace applications, including [[flight software]], [[ground control software]], test & evaluation software, etc.\n* [[Reliability engineering|Risk and reliability]]&nbsp;\u2013 the study of risk and reliability assessment techniques and the mathematics involved in the quantitative methods.\n* [[Noise control]]&nbsp;\u2013 the study of the mechanics of sound transfer.\n* [[Aeroacoustics]]&nbsp;\u2013 the study of noise generation via either turbulent fluid motion or aerodynamic forces interacting with surfaces.\n* [[Flight test]]&nbsp;\u2013 designing and executing flight test programs in order to gather and analyze performance and [[handling qualities]] data in order to determine if an aircraft meets its design and performance goals and certification requirements.\n\nThe basis of most of these elements lies in theoretical [[physics]], such as [[fluid dynamics]] for aerodynamics or the [[equations of motion]] for [[flight dynamics]]. There is also a large [[empiricism|empirical]] component. Historically, this empirical component was derived from testing of scale models and prototypes, either in [[wind tunnel]]s or in the free atmosphere. More recently, advances in [[computing]] have enabled the use of [[computational fluid dynamics]] to simulate the behavior of fluid, reducing time and expense spent on wind-tunnel testing. Those studying hydrodynamics or [[Hydroacoustics]] often obtained degrees in Aerospace Engineering.\n\nAdditionally, aerospace engineering addresses the integration of all components that constitute an aerospace vehicle (subsystems including power, [[aerospace bearing]]s, communications, [[Temperature control|thermal control]], [[life support]], etc.) and its life cycle (design, temperature, pressure, [[radiation]], [[velocity]], [[Fatigue (material)|lifetime]]).\n\n==Degree programs==\n{{Main|List of aerospace engineering schools}}\n\nAerospace engineering may be studied at the [[diploma|advanced diploma]], [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], [[master's degree|master's]], and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] levels in aerospace engineering departments at many universities, and in [[mechanical engineering]] departments at others. A few departments offer degrees in space-focused astronautical engineering.  Some institutions differentiate between aeronautical and astronautical engineering.  Graduate degrees are offered in advanced or specialty areas for the aerospace industry.\n\nA background in chemistry, physics, computer science and mathematics is important for students pursuing an aerospace engineering degree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.myfuture.com/careers/education/aerospace-engineers_17-2011.00 |title=Entry education, Aerospace Engineers |publisher=myfuture.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-22}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe term \"[[wikt:rocket scientist|rocket scientist]]\" is sometimes used to describe a person of great [[intelligence]] since \"rocket science\" is seen as a practice requiring great mental ability, especially technical and mathematical ability.
