This allows a single transmission medium such as the [[radio spectrum]], a cable or [[optical fiber]] to be shared by multiple independent signals.  Another use is to carry separate serial bits or segments of a higher rate signal in parallel.\n \nThe most natural example of frequency-division multiplexing is [[radio]] and television [[broadcasting]], in which multiple radio signals at different frequencies pass through the air at the same time.  Another example is [[cable television]], in which many television channels are carried simultaneously on a single cable. FDM is also used by telephone systems to transmit multiple telephone calls through high capacity trunklines, [[communications satellite]]s to transmit multiple channels of data on uplink and downlink radio beams, and broadband [[DSL modem]]s to transmit large amounts of computer data through [[twisted pair]] telephone lines, among many other uses.\n\nAn analogous technique called [[wavelength division multiplexing]] is used in [[fiber-optic communication]], in which multiple channels of data are transmitted over a single [[optical fiber]] using different [[wavelength]]s (frequencies) of light.\n\n== How it works ==\n[[File:Screenshot-fdm-75-random-am.png|thumb|The passband of an FDM channel carrying digital data, modulated by QPSK [[quadrature phase-shift keying]].  ]]\nThe multiple separate information (modulation) signals that are sent over an FDM system, such as the video signals of the television channels that are sent over a cable TV system,  are called [[baseband]] signals.   At the source end, for each frequency channel, an [[electronic oscillator]] generates a ''[[carrier signal|carrier]]'' signal, a steady oscillating waveform at a single [[frequency]] that serves to \"carry\" information. The carrier is much higher in frequency than the baseband signal.  The carrier signal and the baseband signal are combined in a [[modulator]] circuit.  The modulator alters some aspect of the carrier signal, such as its [[amplitude]], [[frequency]], or phase, with the baseband signal, \"piggybacking\" the data onto the carrier.\n\nThe result of [[modulation|modulating]] (mixing) the carrier with the baseband signal is to generate sub-frequencies near the [[carrier frequency]], at the sum (''f''<sub>C</sub> + ''f''<sub>B</sub>) and difference (''f''<sub>C</sub> \u2212 ''f''<sub>B</sub>) of the frequencies.  The information from the modulated signal is carried in [[sideband]]s on each side of the carrier frequency.  Therefore, all the information carried by the channel is in a narrow band of frequencies clustered around the carrier frequency, this is called the [[passband]] of the channel.\n\nSimilarly, additional baseband signals are used to modulate carriers at other frequencies, creating other channels of information.  The carriers are spaced far enough apart in frequency that the band of frequencies occupied by each channel, the passbands of the separate channels, do not overlap.  All the channels are sent through the transmission medium, such as a coaxial cable, optical fiber, or through the air using a [[radio transmitter]].   As long as the channel frequencies are spaced far enough apart that none of the passbands overlap, the separate channels will not interfere with each another. Thus the available bandwidth is divided into \"slots\" or channels, each of which can carry a separate modulated signal.\n\nFor example, the [[coaxial cable]] used by [[cable television]] systems has a bandwidth of about 1000 [[MHz]], but the passband of each television channel is only 6&nbsp;MHz wide, so there is room for many channels on the cable (in modern [[digital cable]] systems each channel in turn is subdivided into subchannels and can carry up to 10 digital television channels).\n\nAt the destination end of the cable or fiber, or the radio receiver,  for each channel a [[local oscillator]] produces a signal at the carrier frequency of that channel, that is mixed with the incoming modulated signal.  The frequencies subtract, producing the baseband signal for that channel again.   This is called [[demodulation]].   The resulting baseband signal is filtered out of the other frequencies and output to the user.\n\n== Telephone ==\nFor [[long distance telephone connection]]s, 20th century telephone companies used [[L-carrier]] and similar [[co-axial cable]] systems carrying thousands of voice circuits multiplexed in multiple stages by [[channel bank]]s.\n\nFor shorter distances, cheaper [[balanced pair]] cables were used for various systems including [[Bell System]] K- and N-Carrier. Those cables didn't allow such large bandwidths, so only 12 voice channels ([[double sideband]]) and later 24 ([[single sideband]]) were multiplexed into [[four-wire circuit|four wires]], one pair for each direction with [[repeater]]s every several miles, approximately 10&nbsp;km.  See [[12-channel carrier system]].  By the end of the 20th Century, FDM voice circuits had become rare.  Modern telephone systems employ digital transmission, in which [[time-division multiplexing]] (TDM) is used instead of FDM.\n\nSince the late 20th century [[digital subscriber line]]s (DSL) have used a [[orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|Discrete multitone]] (DMT) system to divide their spectrum into frequency channels.\n\nThe concept corresponding to frequency-division multiplexing in the optical domain is known as [[wavelength-division multiplexing]].\n\n=== Group and supergroup ===\nA once commonplace FDM system, used for example in [[L-carrier]], uses crystal filters which operate at the 8&nbsp;MHz range to form a Channel Group of 12 channels, 48&nbsp;kHz bandwidth in the range 8140 to 8188&nbsp;kHz by selecting carriers in the range 8140 to 8184&nbsp;kHz selecting [[upper sideband]] this group can then be translated to the standard range 60 to 108&nbsp;kHz by a carrier of 8248&nbsp;kHz.  Such systems are used in DTL (Direct To Line) and DFSG (Directly formed super group).\n\n132 voice channels (2SG + 1G) can be formed using '''DTL''' plane the modulation and frequency plan are given in FIG1 and FIG2 use of DTL technique allows the formation of a maximum of 132 voice channels that can be placed direct to line. DTL eliminates group and super group equipment.\n\n'''DFSG''' can take similar steps where a direct formation of a number of super groups can be obtained in the 8&nbsp;kHz the DFSG also eliminates group equipment and can offer:\n* Reduction in cost 7% to 13%\n* Less equipment to install and maintain\n* Increased reliability due to less equipment\n\nBoth DTL and DFSG can fit the requirement of low density system (using DTL) and higher density system (using DFSG).  The DFSG terminal is similar to DTL terminal except instead of two super groups many super groups are combined.  A Mastergroup of 600 channels (10 super-groups) is an example based on DFSG.\n\n== Other examples ==\nFDM can also be used to combine signals before final modulation onto a carrier wave. In this case the [[carrier signal]]s are referred to as [[subcarrier]]s: an example is [[stereo FM]] transmission, where a 38&nbsp;kHz subcarrier is used to separate the left-right difference signal from the central left-right sum channel, prior to the frequency modulation of the composite signal.\nAn analog [[NTSC]] television channel is divided into [[subcarrier#Television|subcarrier frequencies]] for video, color, and audio.\nDSL uses different frequencies for voice and for [[upstream (networking)|upstream]] and [[downstream (computer science)|downstream]] data transmission on the same conductors, which is also an example of [[frequency duplex]].\n\t \nWhere frequency-division multiplexing is used as to allow multiple users to share a physical [[communications channel]], it is called [[frequency-division multiple access]] (FDMA).<ref>\n{{cite book | last = White | first = Curt | year = 2007 | title = Data Communications and Computer Networks | publisher = Thomson Course Technology | location = Boston, MA\n| pages = 140\u2013143\n| isbn = 1-4188-3610-9\n}}\n</ref>\n\nFDMA is the traditional way of separating [[radio]] signals from different\ntransmitters.\n\t \nIn the 1860s and 70s, several inventors attempted FDM under the names of [[acoustic telegraphy]] and harmonic telegraphy. Practical FDM was only achieved in the electronic age. Meanwhile, their efforts led to an elementary understanding of electroacoustic technology, resulting in the [[invention of the telephone]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]] (OFDM)\n* [[AN/UCC-4]] \u2013 an example of FDM implementation\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n;General\n* Harold P.E.
