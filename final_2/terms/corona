The Sun's corona extends millions of kilometres into space and is most easily seen during a total [[solar eclipse]], but it is also observable with a [[coronagraph]]. The word \"corona\" is a [[Latin language|Latin]] word meaning \"crown\", from the [[Ancient Greek]] \u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7 (kor\u014dn\u00e8, \u201cgarland, wreath\u201d).\n\nThe high temperature of the Sun's corona gives it unusual [[spectroscopy|spectral]] features, which led some in the 19th century to suggest that it contained a previously unknown element, \"[[coronium]]\". Instead, these spectral features have since been explained by [[highly charged ion|highly ionized]] [[iron]] (Fe-XIV).  [[Bengt Edl\u00e9n]], following the work of Grotrian (1939), first identified the coronal spectral lines in 1940 (observed since 1869) as transitions from low-lying metastable levels of the ground configuration of highly ionised metals (the green Fe-XIV line at 5303&nbsp;\u00c5, but also the red line Fe-X at 6374&nbsp;\u00c5).  These high stages of [[ionisation]] indicate a plasma temperature in excess of 1,000,000 [[kelvin]],<ref name=\"Aschwanden\">{{cite book\n|last=Aschwanden\n|first=M.

The K-corona (K&nbsp;for ''kontinuierlich'', \"continuous\" in German) is created by sunlight scattering off free [[electron]]s; [[Doppler broadening]] of the reflected photospheric absorption lines spreads them so greatly as to completely obscure them, giving the spectral appearance of a continuum with no absorption lines. The F-corona (F&nbsp;for [[Joseph von Fraunhofer|Fraunhofer]]) is created by sunlight bouncing off dust particles, and is observable because its light contains the Fraunhofer absorption lines that are seen in raw sunlight; the F-corona extends to very high [[elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] angles from the Sun, where it is called the [[zodiacal light]]. The E-corona (E for emission) is due to spectral emission lines produced by ions that are present in the coronal plasma; it may be observed in broad or [[forbidden line|forbidden]] or hot [[spectral line|spectral emission lines]] and is the main source of information about the corona's composition.<ref name=\"Corfield\">{{cite book\n|last=Corfield\n|first=Richard\n|year=2007\n|title=Lives of the Planets\n|publisher=Basic Books\n|isbn=978-0-465-01403-3}}\n</ref>\n\n==Physical features==\n[[File:Twistedflux.png|thumb|A drawing demonstrating the configuration of solar magnetic flux during the solar cycle]]\n\nThe sun's corona is much hotter (by a factor from 150 to 450) than the visible surface of the Sun: the [[photosphere]]'s average [[temperature]] is 5800 [[kelvin]] compared to the corona's one to three million kelvin. The corona is 10<sup>\u221212</sup> times as dense as the photosphere, and so produces about one-millionth as much visible light. The corona is separated from the photosphere by the relatively shallow [[chromosphere]]. The exact mechanism by which the corona is heated is still the subject of some debate, but likely possibilities include induction by the Sun's [[magnetic field]] and [[Magnetohydrodynamics|magnetohydrodynamic waves]] from below. The outer edges of the Sun's corona are constantly being transported away due to open magnetic flux and hence generating the [[solar wind]].\n\nThe corona is not always evenly distributed across the surface of the sun. During periods of quiet, the corona is more or less confined to the [[equator]]ial regions, with [[coronal hole]]s covering the [[Geographical pole|polar]] regions. However, during the Sun's active periods, the corona is evenly distributed over the equatorial and polar regions, though it is most prominent in areas with [[sunspot]] activity. The [[solar cycle]] spans approximately 11 years, from [[solar minimum]] to the following minimum. Since the solar magnetic field is continually wound up due to the faster rotation of mass at the sun's equator ([[differential rotation]]), sunspot activity will be more pronounced at [[solar maximum]] where the [[magnetic field]] is more twisted. Associated with sunspots are [[coronal loop]]s, loops of [[magnetic flux]], upwelling from the solar interior. The magnetic flux pushes the hotter [[photosphere]] aside, exposing the cooler plasma below, thus creating the relatively dark sun spots.\n\nSince the corona has been photographed at high resolution in the X-ray range of the spectrum by the satellite [[Skylab]] in 1973, and then later by [[Yohkoh]] and the other following space instruments, it has been seen that the structure of the corona is quite varied and complex: different zones have been immediately classified on the coronal disc.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/BF00152731|last1 = Vaiana|first1 = G.

The average temperature is between two and four million Kelvin, while the density goes from 10<sup>9</sup> to 10<sup>10</sup> particle per cm<sup>3</sup>.\n\n[[File:Prominence (PSF).png|thumb|Illustration depicting [[solar prominences]] and [[sunspot]]s]]\nActive regions involve all the phenomena directly linked to the magnetic field, which occur at different heights above the Sun's surface:<ref name=\"Gibson\"/> [[sunspot]]s and [[facula]]e, occur in the photosphere, [[spicule (solar physics)|spicules]], [[H\u03b1]] [[Solar prominence|filaments]] and [[plage (astronomy)|plages]] in the chromosphere, [[solar prominences|prominences]] in the chromosphere and transition region, and [[Solar flare|flares]] and [[coronal mass ejection]]s happen in the corona and chromosphere. If flares are very violent, they can also perturb the photosphere and generate a [[Moreton wave]]. On the contrary, quiescent prominences are large, cool dense structures which are observed as dark, \"snake-like\" H\u03b1 ribbons (appearing like filaments) on the solar disc. Their temperature is about 5000\u20138000&nbsp;K, and so they are usually considered as chromospheric features.\n\nIn 2013, images from the [[High Resolution Coronal Imager]] revealed never-before-seen \"magnetic braids\" of plasma within the outer layers of these active regions.<ref>http://www.space.com/19400-sun-corona-secrets-suborbital-telescope.html</ref>\n\n====Coronal loops====\n{{main article|Coronal loop}}\n[[File:Traceimage.jpg|left|thumb|TRACE 171\u00c5 coronal loops]]\n[[Coronal loop]]s are the basic structures of the magnetic solar corona. These loops are the closed-magnetic flux cousins of the open-magnetic flux that can be found in [[coronal hole]] (polar) regions and the [[solar wind]]. Loops of magnetic flux well-up from the solar body and fill with hot solar plasma.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1086/427488|last1 = Katsukawa|first1 = Yukio|last2 = Tsuneta|first2 = Saku | title = Magnetic Properties at Footpoints of Hot and Cool Loops | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 621 | pages = 498\u2013511 | year = 2005 | bibcode=2005ApJ...621..498K}}</ref> Due to the heightened magnetic activity in these coronal loop regions, coronal loops can often be the precursor to [[solar flares]] and [[coronal mass ejection]]s (CMEs).\n\nThe Solar plasma that feed these structures is heated from under 6000 K to well over 10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;K from the photosphere, through the transition region, and into the corona. Often, the solar plasma will fill these loops from one point and drain to another, called foot points ([[siphon]] flow due to a pressure difference,<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1023/A:1005182503751|last1 = Betta |first1 = Rita|last2 = Orlando|first2 = Salvatore|last3 = Peres|first3 = Giovanni|last4 = Serio|first4 = Salvatore | title = On the Stability of Siphon Flows in Coronal Loops\n  | journal = Space Science Reviews | volume = 87 | pages = 133\u2013136| year = 1999|bibcode = 1999SSRv...87..133B }}</ref> or asymmetric flow due to some other driver).\n\nWhen the plasma rises from the foot points towards the loop top, as it always occurs during the initial phase of a compact flare, it is defined as chromospheric [[evaporation]]. The plasma rapidly cools and falls toward the photosphere, it is called chromospheric [[condensation]]. There may also be [[symmetric]] flow from both loop foot points, causing a build-up of mass in the loop structure. The plasma may cool rapidly in this region (for a thermal instability), its dark [[Solar prominence|filaments]] obvious against the solar disk or [[solar prominence|prominences]] off the [[limb darkening|Sun's limb]].\n\nCoronal loops may have lifetimes in the order of seconds (in the case of flare events), minutes, hours or days. Where there is a balance in loop energy sources and sinks, coronal loops can last for long periods of time and are known as ''[[steady state]]'' or ''[[wikt:quiescent|quiescent]]'' coronal loops.  ([[:File:Energyfig.png|example]]).\n\nCoronal loops are very important to our understanding of the current ''coronal heating problem''. Coronal loops are highly radiating sources of plasma and are therefore easy to observe by instruments such as ''[[TRACE]]''. An explanation of the coronal heating problem remains as these structures are being observed remotely, where many ambiguities are present (i.e. radiation contributions along the [[Line-of-sight propagation|LOS]]). ''[[In-situ]]'' measurements are required before a definitive answer can be had, but due to the high plasma temperatures in the corona, ''in-situ'' measurements are, at present, impossible. The next mission of the NASA [[Solar Probe Plus]] will approach the Sun very closely allowing more direct observations.\n\n[[File:Coronal Hole Magnetic Field Lines.svg|thumb|Coronal arches connecting regions of opposite magnetic polarity (A) and the unipolar magnetic field in the coronal hole (B)]]\n\n====Large-scale structures====\n'''Large-scale structures''' are very long arcs which can cover over a quarter of the solar disk but contain plasma less dense than in the coronal loops of the active regions.\n\nThey were first detected in the June 8, 1968 flare observation during a rocket flight.<ref name = Giacconi>{{cite book |last = Giacconi| first = Riccardo| title = G.S.

Significant variations of these structures are often seen after a flare.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nSome other features of this kind are [[helmet streamer]]s\u2014large cap-like coronal structures with long pointed peaks that usually overlie sunspots and active regions.

A very long filament cavity is visible across the Sun's southern hemisphere.]]\n\n'''Filament cavities''' are zones which look dark in the X-rays and are above the regions where [[H\u03b1]] filaments are observed in the chromosphere. They were first observed in the two 1970 rocket flights which also detected ''coronal holes''.<ref name=Giacconi />\n\nFilament cavities are cooler clouds of gases (plasma) suspended above the Sun's surface by magnetic forces. The regions of intense magnetic field look dark in images because they are empty of hot plasma. In fact, the sum of the [[magnetic pressure]] and plasma pressure must be constant everywhere on the heliosphere in order to have an equilibrium configuration: where the magnetic field is higher, the plasma must be cooler or less dense. The plasma pressure <math>p</math> can be calculated by the [[state equation]] of a perfect gas  <math> p = n K_B T</math>, where <math>n</math> is the [[particle number density]], <math>K_B</math> the [[Boltzmann constant]] and <math>T</math> the plasma temperature. It is evident from the equation that the plasma pressure lowers when the plasma temperature decreases with respect to the surrounding regions or when the zone of intense magnetic field empties. The same physical effect renders [[sunspot]]s apparently dark in the [[photosphere]].\n\n====Bright points====\n'''Bright points''' are small active regions found on the solar disk. X-ray bright points were first detected on April 8, 1969 during a rocket flight.<ref name=Giacconi />\n\nThe fraction of the solar surface covered by bright points varies with the [[solar cycle]]. They are associated with small bipolar regions of the magnetic field. Their average temperature ranges from 1.1x10<sup>6</sup> K to 3.4x10<sup>6</sup> K. The variations in temperature are often correlated with changes in the X-ray emission.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kariyappa, R.; Deluca, E. E.; Saar, S. H.; Golub, L.; Dam\u00e9, L.; Pevtsov, A.

The high speed [[solar wind]] arises mainly from these regions.\n\nIn the UV images of the coronal holes, some small structures, similar to elongated bubbles, are often seen as they were suspended in the solar wind. These are the coronal '''plumes'''. More exactly, they are long thin streamers that project outward from the Sun's north and south poles.<ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20021628| last1=Del Zanna | first1=G.| last2=Bromage| first2=B.

The result of the Sun's differential rotation is that the active regions always arise in two bands parallel to the equator and their extension increases during the periods of maximum of the [[solar cycle]], while they almost disappear during each minimum. Therefore, the quiet Sun always coincides with the equatorial zone and its surface is less active during the maximum of the solar cycle. Approaching the minimum of the solar cycle (also named butterfly cycle), the extension of the quiet Sun increases until it covers the whole disk surface excluding some bright points on the hemisphere and the poles, where there are the coronal holes.\n\n==Variability of the corona==\nA portrait as diversified as the one already pointed out for the coronal features is emphasized by the analysis of the dynamics of the main structures of the corona,  which evolve in times very different among them. Studying the coronal variability in its complexity is not easy because the times of evolution of the different structures can vary considerably: from seconds to several months. The typical sizes of the regions where coronal events take place vary in the same way, as it is shown in the following table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" | title=\"Typical length of observable coronal features\"\n|-\n!

They are very complex phenomena, visible at different wavelengths; they involve several zones of the solar atmosphere and many physical effects, thermal and not thermal, and sometimes wide reconnections of the magnetic field lines with material expulsion.\n\nFlares are impulsive phenomena, of average duration of 15 minutes, and the most energetic events can last several hours. Flares produce a high and rapid increase of the density and temperature.\n\nAn emission in white light is only seldom observed: usually, flares are only seen at extreme UV wavelengths and into the X-rays, typical of the chromospheric and coronal emission.\n\nIn the corona, the morphology of flares, is described by observations in the UV, soft and hard X-rays, and in [[H\u03b1]] wavelengths, and is very complex.

Some larger ejections can propel hundreds of millions of tons of material into [[space]] at roughly 1.5 million kilometers an hour.\n\n===A solar storm===\n{{Missing information|section|SOHO imaging of Solar Storm Activity taken during the October\u2013November period of 2003|date=August 2015}}\nThese movies have been taken by the satellite [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] during two weeks in October and November 2003. The images have been taken at the same time by the different instruments on board SOHO: the MDI, producing [[magnetogram]]s, the [[Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope]] (EIT), which photographs the corona in the ultraviolets, and the [[Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph]] (LASCO).\n\nThe first video at the top on the left (in grey) shows the magnetograms as they vary in time. At the top on the right (in yellow) the photosphere can be seen in white light as taken by the MDI.\n\nFurthermore, the EIT filmed the event in its four filters which are sensitive to different wavelengths, selecting plasma at different temperatures. The images in orange (on the left) refers to chromospheric plasma, while that one in green (on the right) to the corona.\n\nIn the last movie at the centre the Sun's images taken in the ultraviolet filter by the EIT have been combined with those taken by the coronograph LASCO blue and white in this movie.\n\nAll the instruments registered the storm which is considered as one of the largest solar activity events observed by SOHO and maybe since the advent of space-based solar observations. The storm involved all the plasma of the solar atmosphere from the chromosphere to the corona, as can be seen from the movies, which are ordered from left to right, from top to bottom, in the outward direction of the increasing temperature on the Sun: photosphere (yellow), chromosphere-transition region (orange), low corona (green) and extended corona (blue).\n\nThe corona is visible to the SOHO/LASCO coronagraph instruments, which block the bright disk of the Sun so the significantly fainter corona can be seen. In this movie, the inner coronagraph (designated C2) is combined with the outer coronagraph (C3).\n\nAs the movie plays, we can observe a number of features of the active Sun. Long streamers radiate outward from the Sun and wave gently due to their interaction with the solar wind.\nThe bright white regions are visible due to their high density of free electrons which scatter the light from the photosphere towards the observer. Protons and other ionized atoms are there as well, but are not as visible since they do not interact with photons as strongly as electrons. Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are occasionally observed launching from the Sun. Some of these launch particle events can saturate the cameras with snow-like artifacts.\n\nAlso visible in the coronagraphs are stars and planets. Stars are seen to drift slowly to the right, carried by the relative motion of the Sun and the Earth. The planet Mercury is visible as the bright point moving left of the Sun.\n\nThe horizontal \"extension\" in the image is called blooming and is due to charge leakage during readout of saturated pixels in the camera's CCD imager.\n{{Clear}}<!-- If there is a better way to group these images so that they do not overrun the text, please use it. -->\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Stellar coronae==\nCoronal stars are ubiquitous among the [[star]]s in the cool half of the [[Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram]].<ref name=Gudel>{{cite journal |author=G\u00fcdel M |title=X-ray astronomy of stellar coronae |journal=The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review|year=2004 |volume=12 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=71\u2013237 |doi=10.1007/s00159-004-0023-2 |url=http://astronomy.sci.ege.edu.tr/~rpekunlu/GBDG/papers/XRayfromStellarCoronae.pdf|arxiv = astro-ph/0406661 |bibcode = 2004A&ARv..12...71G }}</ref> These coronae can be detected using [[X-ray telescope]]s.

The ionization state of a chemical element depends strictly on the temperature and is regulated by the [[Saha equation]]. Historically, the presence of the spectral lines emitted from highly ionized states of iron allowed determination of the high temperature of the coronal plasma, revealing that the corona is much hotter than the internal layers of the chromosphere.\n\nThe corona behaves like a gas which is very hot but very light at the same time: the pressure in the photosphere is usually only 0.1 to 0.6 Pa in active regions, while on the Earth the atmospheric pressure  is about 100 kPa, approximatively a  million times higher than on the solar surface.\nHowever it is not properly a gas, because it is made of charged particles, basically protons and electrons, moving at different velocities.\nSupposing that they have the same kinetic energy on average\n(for the [[equipartition theorem]]), electrons have a mass roughly 1800 times smaller than protons, therefore they acquire more velocity. Metal ions are always slower. This fact has relevant physical consequences either on radiative processes (that are very different from the photospheric radiative processes), or on thermal conduction.\nFurthermore, the presence of electric charges induces the generation of electric currents and high magnetic fields.\nMagnetohydrodynamic waves (MHD waves) can also propagate in this plasma,<ref name=\"Jeffrey\">{{cite book\n|last = Jeffrey\n|first = Alan\n|year =1969\n|title = Magneto-hydrodynamics\n|publisher = UNIVERSITY MATHEMATICAL TEXTS\n}}</ref> even if it is not still clear how they can be transmitted or generated in the corona.\n\n===Radiation===\n{{Main article|Coronal radiative losses}}\n\nThe corona emits radiation mainly in the X-rays, observable only from space.\n\nThe plasma is transparent to its own radiation and to that one coming from below, therefore we say that it is  '''optically-thin'''. The gas, in fact, is very rarefied and the photon mean free-path overcomes by far all the other length-scales, including the typical sizes of the coronal features.\n\nDifferent processes of radiation take place in the emission, due to binary collisions between plasma particles, while the interactions with the photons, coming from below; are very rare.\nBecause the emission is due to collisions between ions and electrons, the energy emitted from a unit volume in the time unit is proportional to the squared number of particles in a unit volume, or more exactly, to the product of the electron density and proton density.<ref>{{cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF00873539| last = Mewe | first = R.| title = X-ray spectroscopy of stellar coronae| journal = The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | page = 127 | year = 1991 | bibcode=1991A&ARv...3..127M}}</ref>\n\n===Thermal conduction===\n[[File:STEREO-A first images.jpg|thumb|A mosaic of the extreme ultraviolet images taken from [[STEREO]] on December 4, 2006.

Responsible for the diffusion process of the heat are the electrons, which are much lighter than ions and move faster, as explained above.\n\nWhen there is a magnetic field the [[thermal conductivity]] of the plasma becomes higher in the direction which is parallel to the field lines rather than in the perpendicular direction.<ref name=\"Spitzer\">{{cite book\n|last=Spitzer\n|first= L.\n|year=1962\n|title= Physics of fully ionized gas\n|publisher= Interscience tracts of physics and astronomy\n}}</ref>\nA charged particle moving in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field line is subject to the [[Lorentz force]] which is normal to the plane individuated by the velocity and the  magnetic field. This force bends the path of the particle. In general, since particles also have a velocity component along the magnetic field line, the [[Lorentz force]] constrains them to bend and move along spirals around the field lines at the [[cyclotron]] frequency.\n\nIf collisions between the particles are very frequent, they are scattered in every direction. This happens in the photosphere, where the plasma carries the magnetic  field in its motion. In the corona, on the contrary, the mean free-path of the electrons is of the order of kilometres and even more, so each electron can do a helicoidal motion long before being scattered after a collision. Therefore, the heat transfer is enhanced along the magnetic field lines and inhibited in the  perpendicular direction.\n\nIn the direction longitudinal to the magnetic field, the [[thermal conductivity]] of the corona is<ref name=\"Spitzer\" />\n\n<math>\nk = 20 \\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\right)^{3/2}\\frac{\\left(k_B T \\right)^{5/2}k_B}{m_e^{1/2} e^4 \\ln \\Lambda} \\approx 1.8~10^{-10}~\\frac{T^{5/2}}{\\ln \\Lambda}~ W m^{-1}K^{-1}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>k_B</math> is the [[Boltzmann constant]],\n<math>T</math> is the temperature in Kelvin,\n<math>m_e</math> the electron mass,\n<math>e</math> the electric charge of the electron,\n\n<math> \\ln \\Lambda = \\ln \\left(12\\pi n \\lambda_D^3 \\right) </math>\n\nthe Coulomb logarithm, and\n\n<math>\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T }{4 \\pi n e^2 }}</math>\n\nthe [[Debye length]] of the plasma with particle density  <math>n</math>.\nThe Coulomb logarithm <math> \\ln \\Lambda </math> is roughly 20 in the corona, with a mean temperature of 1 MK and a density of 10<sup>15</sup> particles/m<sup>3</sup>, and about 10 in the chromosphere, where the temperature is approximately 10kK  and the particle density is of the order of 10<sup>18</sup> particles/m<sup>3</sup>, and in practice it can be assumed constant.\n\nThence, if we indicate with <math>q</math> the heat for a volume unit, expressed in J m<sup>\u22123</sup>, the Fourier equation of heat transfer, to be computed only along the direction <math>x</math> of the field line, becomes\n\n<math> \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial t}= 0.9~10^{-11}~ \\frac{\\partial^2  T^{7/2}}{\\partial x ^2 }</math>.\n\nNumerical calculations have shown that the thermal conductivity of the corona is comparable to that of copper.\n\n===Coronal seismology===\n{{main article|Coronal seismology}}\n'''Coronal seismology''' is a new way of studying the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of the solar corona with the use of [[magnetohydrodynamics|magnetohydrodynamic]] (MHD) waves. Magnetohydrodynamics studies the [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of [[electrical conduction|electrically conducting]] [[fluid]]s\u2014in this case the fluid is the coronal plasma. Philosophically, coronal seismology is similar to the Earth's [[seismology]], the Sun's [[helioseismology]], and MHD spectroscopy of laboratory plasma devices. In all these approaches, waves of various kinds are used to probe a medium. The potential of coronal seismology in the estimation of the coronal magnetic field, density [[scale height]], [[fine structure]] and heating has been demonstrated by different research groups.\n\n==Coronal heating problem==\n{{unsolved|physics|Why is the Sun's Corona so much hotter than the Sun's surface?}}\n[[File:Van Gogh Sun.ogv|thumb|A new visualisation technique can provide clues to the coronal heating problem.]]\n\nThe coronal heating problem in [[solar physics]] relates to the question of why the temperature of the Sun's corona is millions of kelvin higher than that of the surface. The high temperatures require energy to be carried from the solar interior to the corona by non-thermal processes, because the [[second law of thermodynamics]] prevents heat from flowing directly from the solar photosphere (surface), which is at about 5800 K, to the much hotter corona at about 1 to 3 [[SI prefix|MK]] (parts of the corona can even reach 10 MK).\n\nBetween the photosphere and the corona, is the thin region through which the temperature increases known as the [[solar transition region|transition region]]. It ranges from only tens to hundreds of kilometers thick. Energy cannot be transferred from the cooler photosphere to the corona by conventional heat transfer as this would violate the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. An analogy of this would be a light bulb raising the temperature of the air surrounding it to something greater than its glass surface.  Hence, some other manner of energy transfer must be involved in the heating of the corona.\n\nThe amount of power required to heat the solar corona can easily be calculated as the difference between [[coronal radiative losses]] and heating by thermal conduction toward the [[chromosphere]] through the transition region. It is about 1 kilowatt for every square meter of surface area on the Sun's chromosphere, or 1/40000 of the amount of light energy that escapes the Sun.\n\nMany coronal heating theories have been proposed,<ref>{{cite book |last = Ulmshneider |first= Peter |title = Heating of Chromospheres and Coronae in ''Space Solar Physics'', Proceedings, Orsay, France, edited by J.C.

It is hypothesized that the reconnection and unravelling of braids can act as primary sources of heating of the active solar corona to temperatures of up to 4 million kelvin. The main heat source in the quiescent corona (about 1.5 million kelvin) is assumed to originate from MHD waves.<ref name=Cirtain2013>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cirtain | first1 = J.

The Sun is made of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] rather than ordinary gas, so it supports several types of waves analogous to [[sound waves]] in air. The most important types of wave are [[magneto-acoustic wave]]s and [[Alfv\u00e9n wave]]s.<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Alfv\u00e9n\n  | first = Hannes\n  | title = Magneto hydrodynamic waves, and the heating of the solar corona\n  | journal = MNRAS\n  | volume = 107\n  | pages = 211\u2013219\n  | year = 1947\n  |bibcode = 1947MNRAS.107..211A\n  | doi=10.1093/mnras/107.2.211}}</ref> Magneto-acoustic waves are sound waves that have been modified by the presence of a magnetic field, and Alfv\u00e9n waves are similar to [[ultra low frequency]] [[radio waves]] that have been modified by interaction with [[matter]] in the plasma. Both types of waves can be launched by the turbulence of [[Granule (solar physics)|granulation]] and [[super granulation]] at the solar photosphere, and both types of waves can carry energy for some distance through the solar atmosphere before turning into [[shock waves]] that dissipate their energy as heat.\n\nOne problem with wave heating is delivery of the heat to the appropriate place. Magneto-acoustic waves cannot carry sufficient energy upward through the chromosphere to the corona, both because of the low pressure present in the chromosphere and because they tend to be [[reflection (physics)|reflected]] back to the photosphere. Alfv\u00e9n waves can carry enough energy, but do not dissipate that energy rapidly enough once they enter the corona. Waves in plasmas are notoriously difficult to understand and describe analytically, but computer simulations, carried out by Thomas Bogdan and colleagues in 2003, seem to show that Alfv\u00e9n waves can transmute into other wave modes at the base of the corona, providing a pathway that can carry large amounts of energy from the photosphere through the chromosphere and transition region and finally into the corona where it dissipates it as heat.\n\nAnother problem with wave heating has been the complete absence, until the late 1990s, of any direct evidence of waves propagating through the solar corona. The first direct observation of waves propagating into and through the solar corona was made in 1997 with the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] space-borne solar observatory, the first platform capable of observing the Sun in the [[extreme ultraviolet]] (EUV) for long periods of time with stable [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. Those were magneto-acoustic waves with a frequency of about 1 [[hertz|millihertz]] (mHz, corresponding to a 1,000 second wave period), that carry only about 10% of the energy required to heat the corona. Many observations exist of localized wave phenomena, such as Alfv\u00e9n waves launched by solar flares, but those events are transient and cannot explain the uniform coronal heat.\n\nIt is not yet known exactly how much wave energy is available to heat the corona. Results published in 2004 using data from the [[TRACE]] spacecraft seem to indicate that there are waves in the solar atmosphere at frequencies as high as 100 mHz (10 second period). Measurements of the temperature of different [[ions]] in the solar wind with the UVCS instrument aboard [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] give strong indirect evidence that there are waves at frequencies as high as 200&nbsp;Hz, well into the range of human hearing. These waves are very difficult to detect under normal circumstances, but evidence collected during solar eclipses by teams from [[Williams College]] suggest the presences of such waves in the 1\u201310&nbsp;Hz range.\n\nRecently, Alfv\u00e9nic motions have been found in the lower solar atmosphere <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.science20.com/news_releases/alfven_waves_our_sun_doing_magnetic_twist |title = Alfven Waves \u2013 Our Sun Is Doing The Magnetic Twist|publisher=read on Jan 6 2011}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1168680 | last1 = Jess | first1 = DB | last2 = Mathioudakis | first2 = M | last3 = Erd\u00e9lyi | first3 = R | last4 = Crockett | first4 = PJ | last5 = Keenan | first5 = FP | last6 = Christian | first6 = DJ | title = Alfv\u00e9n Waves in the Lower Solar Atmosphere | journal = Science | volume = 323| issue =  5921 | pages = 1582\u20131585 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19299614|bibcode = 2009Sci...323.1582J |arxiv = 0903.3546 }}</ref> and also in the quiet Sun, in coronal holes and in active regions using observations with AIA on board the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]].<ref>{{cite journal|author1=McIntosh, S.

This process is called \"reconnection\" because of the peculiar way that magnetic fields behave in plasma (or any electrically conductive fluid such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[seawater]]). In a plasma, [[magnetic field lines]] are normally tied to individual pieces of matter, so that the [[topology]] of the magnetic field remains the same: if a particular north and south [[Poles of astronomical bodies#Magnetic poles|magnetic pole]] are connected by a single field line, then even if the plasma is stirred or if the magnets are moved around, that field line will continue to connect those particular poles. The connection is maintained by electric currents that are induced in the plasma. Under certain conditions, the electric currents can collapse, allowing the magnetic field to \"reconnect\" to other magnetic poles and release heat and wave energy in the process.\n\n[[Magnetic reconnection]] is hypothesized to be the mechanism behind solar flares, the largest explosions in our solar system. Furthermore, the surface of the Sun is covered with millions of small magnetized regions 50\u20131,000&nbsp;km across. These small magnetic poles are buffeted and churned by the constant granulation. The magnetic field in the solar corona must undergo nearly constant reconnection to match the motion of this \"magnetic carpet\", so the energy released by the reconnection is a natural candidate for the coronal heat, perhaps as a series of \"microflares\" that individually provide very little energy but together account for the required energy.\n\nThe idea that [[nanoflares]] might heat the corona was proposed by [[Eugene Parker]] in the 1980s but is still controversial. In particular, [[ultraviolet]] telescopes such as [[TRACE]] and [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]]/EIT can observe individual micro-flares as small brightenings in extreme ultraviolet light,<ref>{{cite journal\n  | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20020151\n  | last1 = Patsourakos\n  | first1 = S.\n  | last2 = Vial\n  | first2 = J.-C.\n  | title = Intermittent behavior in the transition region and the low corona of the quiet Sun\n  | journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics\n  | volume = 385\n  | issue = 3\n  | pages = 1073\u20131077\n  | year = 2002\n| bibcode=2002A&A...385.1073P\n}}</ref> but there seem to be too few of these small events to account for the energy released into the corona. The additional energy not accounted for could be made up by wave energy, or by gradual magnetic reconnection that releases energy more smoothly than micro-flares and therefore doesn't appear well in the [[TRACE]] data. Variations on the micro-flare hypothesis use other mechanisms to stress the magnetic field or to release the energy, and are a subject of active research in 2005.\n\n===Spicules (type II)===\nFor decades, researchers believed [[spicule (solar physics)|spicules]] could send heat into the corona. However, following observational research in the 1980s, it was found that spicule plasma did not reach coronal temperatures, and so the theory was discounted.\n\nAs per studies performed in 2010 at the ''National Center for Atmospheric Research'' in [[Colorado]], in collaboration with the ''Lockheed Martin's Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory'' (LMSAL) and the ''Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics'' of the [[University of Oslo]], a new class of spicules (TYPE II) discovered in 2007, which travel faster (up to 100&nbsp;km/s) and have shorter lifespans, can account for the problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-mystery-of-suns-hot-outer-atmosphere-solved/20110107.htm |title=Mystery of Sun's hot outer atmosphere 'solved' \u2013 Rediff.com News |publisher=Rediff.com |date=2011-01-07 |accessdate=2012-05-21}}</ref> These jets insert heated plasma into the Sun's outer atmosphere.\n\nThus, a much greater understanding of the Corona and improvement in the knowledge of the Sun's subtle influence on the Earth's upper atmosphere can be expected henceforth.
