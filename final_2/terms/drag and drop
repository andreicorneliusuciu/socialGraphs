In general, it can be used to invoke many kinds of actions, or create various types of associations between two [[abstract object]]s. \n\nAs a feature, drag-and-drop support is not found in all [[software]], though it is sometimes a fast and easy-to-learn technique. However, it is not always clear to users that an item can be dragged and dropped, or what is the command performed by the drag and drop, which can decrease usability.<ref>Jakob Nielsen, \"Top-10 Application-Design Mistakes,\" http://www.useit.com/alertbox/application-mistakes.html (19 February 2008).</ref>\n\n== Actions ==\n\nThe basic sequence involved in drag and drop is:\n* Move the [[pointer (computing WIMP)|pointer]] to the object\n* Press, and hold down, the button on the [[computer mouse|mouse]] or other [[pointing device]], to \"grab\" the object\n* \"Drag\" the object to the desired location by moving the pointer to this one\n* \"Drop\" the object by releasing the button\n\nDragging requires more physical effort than moving the same pointing device without holding down any buttons. Because of this, a user cannot move as quickly and precisely while dragging (see [[Fitts' law]]). However, drag-and-drop operations have the advantage of thoughtfully chunking together two operands (the object to drag, and the drop location) into a single action.<ref>{{cite conference | author=Buxton, W. | title=Chunking and Phrasing and the Design of Human-Computer Dialogues | booktitle=Proceedings of the IFIP World Computer Congress | year=1986 | pages=475\u2013480 | url=http://www.billbuxton.com/chunking.html }}</ref>\nExtended dragging and dropping (as in graphic design) can stress the mousing hand.\n\nA design problem appears when the same button selects and drags items. Imprecise movement can cause a dragging when the user just wants to select.\n\nAnother problem is that the target of the dropping can be hidden under other objects. The user would have to stop the dragging, make both the source and the target visible and start again. In classic Mac OS the top-of-screen menu bar served as a universal \"drag cancel\" target. This issue has been dealt with in [[Mac OS X]] with the introduction of [[Expos\u00e9 (Mac OS X)|Expos\u00e9]].\n\n== In Mac OS ==\n\nDrag and drop, called '''click and drag''' at the time, was used in the [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]] to manipulate files (for example, copying them between disks<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Disk_Swappers_Elbow.txt&topic=Technical&sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&detail=medium&showcomments=1 |title=Disk Swapper's Elbow |publisher=folklore.org}}</ref> or folders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=The_Grand_Unified_Model_The_Finder.txt |title=The Grand Unified Model (2): The Finder |publisher=folklore.org}}</ref>). [[System 7]] added the ability to open a document in an application by dropping the document icon onto the application's icon.\n\nIn [[System 7.5]], drag and drop was extended to common clipboard operations like copying or moving textual content within a document. Content could also be dragged into the filesystem to create a \"clipping file\" which could then be stored and reused.\n\nFor most of its history Mac OS has used a [[mouse button|single button mouse]] with the button covering a large portion of the top surface of the mouse. This may mitigate the ergonomic concerns of keeping the button pressed while dragging.\n\n== In OS/2 ==\nThe [[Workplace Shell]] of [[OS/2]] uses dragging and dropping extensively with the [[mouse button|secondary mouse button]], leaving the primary one for selection and clicking.\nIts use like that of other advanced [[Common User Access]] features distinguished native OS/2 applications from [[platform-independent]] ports.\n\n== In HTML ==\n\nThe [[HTML5]] working draft specification includes support for drag & drop.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-html5-20120329/ |title=HTML5 W3C Working Draft |publisher=w3.org}}</ref> HTML5 supports different kinds of dragging and dropping features including:\n* Drag and Drop texts and HTML codes\n* Drag and Drop HTML elements\n* Drag and Drop files\nBased on needed action, one of the above types can be used. Note that when an HTML element is dragged for moving its current position, its ID is sent to the destination parent element; so it sends a text and can be considered as the first group.\n\nGoogle's web-based e-mail application [[Gmail]] supports drag-and-drop of images and attachments in the latest [[Google Chrome]] browser and Apple's [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] (5.x). And Google Image search supports drag & drop.\n\n== On a touch screen ==\nTouch screen interfaces also include drag and drop, or more precisely, long press, and then drag, e.g. on the [[iPhone]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] home screens.\n\n== In end-user programming ==\nDrag and drop is considered an important program construction approach in many [[end-user development]] systems. In contrast to more traditional, text-based programming languages, many end-user programming languages are based on visual components such as tiles or icons that are manipulated by end users through drag-and-drop interfaces. Drag and drop is also featured in many shader editing programs for graphics tools, such as [[Blender (software)|Blender]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Materials/Nodes|title=Render \u2014 Blender Reference Manual|work=blender.org}}</ref> Drag and drop also features in some video game engines, including [[Unreal Engine]], [[GameMaker: Studio]], [[Construct 2]] and, with expansion, [[Unity (game engine)]].\n\n== Examples ==\n\nA common example is dragging an icon on a virtual [[desktop environment|desktop]] to a special [[trashcan]] [[icon (computing)|icon]] to delete a [[computer file|file]].\n\nFurther examples include:\n* Dragging a data [[computer file|file]] onto a [[Computer program|program]] [[icon (computing)|icon]] or window for viewing or processing. For instance, dropping an icon that represents a text file into a Microsoft Word window signifies \"Open this document as a new document in Word\"\n* Moving or copying [[computer file|files]] to a new location/directory/folder,\n* Adding objects to a list of objects to be processed,\n* Rearranging [[widget (computing)|widgets]] in a [[graphical user interface]] to customize their layout,\n* Dragging an attribute onto an object to which the command is to be applied,\n** e.g. dragging a color onto a graphical object to change its color,\n* Dragging a tool to a canvas location to apply the tool at that location,\n* Creating a [[hyperlink]] from one location or word to another location or document.\n* Most word processors allow dragging selected text from one point to another.\n* Dragging a series of codeblocks such as in [[Blender (software)|Blender]] for designing shaders and materials.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Mouse gesture]]\n* [[Point and click]]\n* [[Snap (computer graphics)]]\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2010}}\n\n[[Category:User interface techniques]]"}]}}}}
