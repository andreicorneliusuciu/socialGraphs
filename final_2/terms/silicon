A hard and brittle crystalline solid with a blue-gray metallic luster, it is a [[Tetravalence|tetravalent]] [[metalloid]]. It is a member of [[carbon group|group 14]] in the periodic table, along with [[carbon]] above it and germanium, [[tin]], [[lead]], and [[flerovium]] below. It is rather unreactive, though less so than germanium, and has great chemical affinity for oxygen; as such, it was first prepared and characterized in pure form only in 1823 by [[J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius]].<!--In 1808, it was given the name ''silicium'' (from {{lang-la|silex}}, hard stone or [[flint]]), with an '''-ium''' word-ending to suggest a [[metal]], a name which the element retains in several languages. The present [[English language|English]] name was first suggested in 1817 to conform with the physically similar elements carbon and [[boron]]. Despite these physical similarities to carbon, however, the chemistry of silicon shows great differences from that of carbon, with silicon oxides being more important than [[polysilane]] compounds, the reverse of the situation for carbon.-->\n\nSilicon is the eighth most [[Abundance of the chemical elements|common element]] in the universe by mass, but very rarely occurs as the pure element in the Earth's crust. It is most widely distributed in [[dust]]s, [[sand]]s, [[planetoids]], and [[planet]]s as various forms of [[silicon dioxide]] (silica) or [[silicate]]s. Over 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of [[silicate minerals]], making silicon the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|second most abundant element]] in the Earth's crust (about 28% by mass) after [[oxygen]].<ref>Nave, R. [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/tables/elabund.html Abundances of the Elements in the Earth's Crust], Georgia State University</ref>\n\nMost silicon is used commercially without being separated, and often with little processing of the natural minerals. Such use includes industrial construction with [[clays]], [[silica sand]], and [[stone]]. Silicate is used in [[Portland cement]] for [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and [[stucco]], and mixed with silica sand and [[gravel]] to make [[concrete]] for walkways, foundations, and roads. Silicates are used in whiteware [[ceramic]]s such as [[porcelain]], and in traditional [[quartz]]-based [[soda-lime glass]] and many other specialty [[glass]]es. Silicon compounds such as [[silicon carbide]] are used as abrasives and components of high-strength ceramics.\n\nElemental silicon also has a large impact on the modern world economy. Most free silicon is used in the [[steel]] refining, [[aluminium]]-casting, and fine chemical industries (often to make [[fumed silica]]).  Even more visibly, the relatively small portion of very highly purified silicon used in semiconductor electronics (< 10%) is essential to [[integrated circuits]] \u2014 most computers, cell phones, and modern technology depend on it. Silicon is the basis of the widely used synthetic polymers called [[silicone]]s.\n\nSilicon is an essential element in biology, although only tiny traces are required by animals.<ref name=\"Niels\">{{cite journal|doi = 10.1146/annurev.nu.04.070184.000321|pages =21\u201341|journal = Annual Review of Nutrition|volume = 4|date = 1984|title = Ultratrace Elements in Nutrition|first = Forrest H.|last = Nielsen|pmid = 6087860}}</ref> However, various [[sea sponges]] and microorganisms, such as [[diatoms]] and [[radiolaria]], secrete skeletal structures made of silica.

Unlike carbon, it can accept additional electrons and form five or six bonds in a sometimes more [[labile]] [[silicate]] form.

About these \"elements\", Lavoisier speculates: \"We are probably only acquainted as yet with a part of the metallic substances existing in nature, as all those which have a stronger affinity to oxygen than carbon possesses, are incapable, hitherto, of being reduced to a metallic state, and consequently, being only presented to our observation under the form of oxyds, are confounded with earths. It is extremely probable that barytes, which we have just now arranged with earths, is in this situation; for in many experiments it exhibits properties nearly approaching to those of metallic bodies. It is even possible that all the substances we call earths may be only metallic oxyds, irreducible by any hitherto known process.\" \u2013 from [https://books.google.com/books?id=adYKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA218 page 218] of: Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans., ''Elements of Chemistry'', \u2026 , 4th ed.

Deville used two methods to prepare aluminium: heating aluminium chloride with sodium metal in an inert atmosphere (of hydrogen); and melting aluminum chloride with sodium chloride and then electrolyzing the mixture. In both cases, pure silicon was produced: the silicon dissolved in the molten aluminium, but crystallized upon cooling.

In the high temperatures prevalent in the formation of the inner solar system, silicon and oxygen readily combine, forming [[network solid]]s of silicon and oxygen in compounds of low volatility. Since oxygen and silicon were the most common [[Metallicity|metals]] (using the astrochemical definition as anything other than hydrogen or helium) in the debris from [[supernova]] dust which formed the [[protoplanetary disk]] in the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System]], they formed many complex silicates which accreted into larger rocky [[planetesimal]]s that formed the [[terrestrial planet]]s. Here, the reduced silicate mineral matrix entrapped the metals reactive enough to be oxidized (aluminium, calcium, sodium, potassium and magnesium). After loss of volatile gases, as well as carbon and sulfur by reaction with hydrogen, this silicate mixture of elements formed most of the Earth's crust.\n\nThese silicates were of relatively lower density than iron, nickel, and other metals non-reactive to oxygen, and a residuum of uncombined metallic iron and nickel sank to the planet's core, leaving a thick [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] of mostly of magnesium and iron silicates between core and crust.

In the crust, very pure [[silica]] occurs in different crystalline forms of [[quartz]] and [[opal]]. The crystals have the empirical formula of silicon dioxide, but do not consist of discrete silicon dioxide molecules in the manner of solid carbon dioxide. Rather, silica is structurally a network solid consisting of silicon and oxygen in three-dimensional crystals, like diamond. Less pure silica forms the natural glass [[obsidian]].

Metallurgical grade silicon is commercially prepared by the reaction of high-purity [[silica]] with wood, charcoal, and coal in an [[electric arc furnace]] using carbon [[electrode]]s. At temperatures over {{convert|1900|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on|lk=on}}, the carbon in the aforementioned materials and the silicon undergo the [[chemical reaction]]:\n\n: SiO<sub>2</sub> + 2 C \u2192 Si + 2 CO\n\nLiquid silicon collects in the bottom of the furnace, which is then drained and cooled. The silicon produced in this manner is called ''metallurgical grade silicon'' and is at least 98% pure. Using this method, [[silicon carbide]] (SiC) may also form from an excess of carbon in one or both of the following ways:\n\n: SiO<sub>2</sub> + C \u2192 SiO + CO\n: SiO + 2 C \u2192 SiC + CO\n\nHowever, provided the concentration of SiO<sub>2</sub> is kept high, the silicon carbide can be eliminated by the chemical reaction:\n\n: 2 SiC + SiO<sub>2</sub> \u2192 3 Si + 2 CO\n\nAs noted above, metallurgical grade silicon \"metal\" has its primary use in the aluminium casting industry to make aluminium-silicon alloy parts. The remainder (about 45%) is used by the [[chemical industry]], where it is primarily employed to make [[fumed silica]], with the rest used in production of other fine chemicals such as [[silane]]s and some types of [[silicone]]s.<ref name=USGS/>\n\nAs of September 2008, [[metallurgical]] grade silicon costs about [[United States dollar|US$]]1.45 per pound ($3.20/kg),<ref>{{cite web|title=Metallurgical silicon could become a rare commodity \u2013 just how quickly that happens depends to a certain extent on the current financial crisis |url=http://www.photon-magazine.com/news_archiv/details.aspx?cat=News_PI&sub=worldwide&pub=4&parent=1555 |publisher=Photon International |accessdate=2009-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715082847/http://www.photon-magazine.com/news_archiv/details.aspx?cat=News_PI&sub=worldwide&pub=4&parent=1555 |archivedate=July 15, 2011 }}</ref> up from $0.77 per pound ($1.70/kg) in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=Silicon|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/silicon/silicmcs06.pdf|publisher=usgs.gov|accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Polycrystalline silicon rod.jpg|160px|thumb|left|A [[polycrystalline silicon]] rod made by the Siemens process]]\n\n=== Polysilicon ===\n\n{{main article|Polycrystalline silicon}}\n\nToday's purification processes involve the conversion of silicon into volatile liquids, such as [[trichlorosilane]] (HSiCl<sub>3</sub>) and [[silicon tetrachloride]] (SiCl<sub>4</sub>) or into the gaseous [[silane]] (SiH<sub>4</sub>). These compounds are then separated by a [[distillation]] and transformed into high-purity silicon, either by a [[redox]] reaction or by [[thermal decomposition]].\n\nIn the late 1950s, the American chemical company [[DuPont]] patented a method for the production of 99.99% pure silicon, using the metal [[zinc]] as a [[reductant]] to transform redistilled silicon tetrachloride into high-purity silicon by a vapor phase reaction at 900&nbsp;\u00b0C. This technique, however, was plagued with practical problems, as the byproduct zinc chloride (ZnCl<sub>2</sub>) solidified and clogged lines, and was eventually abandoned in favor of more sophisticated processes.<ref>Google.com - Patents [http://www.google.com/patents/US2909411 Production of silicon - Publication number US2909411 A]</ref>\n\n[[File:Silicon purification processes.svg|thumb|Schematic diagram of the traditional Siemens and the [[Fluidized bed reactor]] purification process.]]\n\n==== {{anchor|Siemens process}} Siemens process and alternatives====\n\nThe best known technique is the so-called '''Siemens process'''. This technique does not require a reductant such as zinc, as it grows high-purity silicon [[crystallites]] directly on the surface of (pre-existing) pure silicon seed rods by a [[chemical decomposition]] that takes place when the gaseous trichlorosilane is blown over the rod's surface at 1150&nbsp;\u00b0C. A common name for this type of technique is [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD) and produces high-purity [[polycrystalline silicon]], also known as polysilicon. While the conventional Siemens process produces ''electronic grade'' polysilicon at typically 9N\u201311N purities, that is, it contains impurity levels of less than one [[Parts-per notation|part per billion]] (ppb), the modified Siemens process is a dedicated process-route for the production of silicon with purities of 6N (99.9999%) and less energy demand.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |doi = 10.1007/s11663-010-9440-y\n |title = Production of Solar-grade Silicon by Halidothermic Reduction of Silicon Tetrachloride\n |date = 2010\n |last1 = Yasuda|first1 = Kouji\n |last2 = Saegusa|first2 = Kunio\n |last3 = Okabe|first3 = Toru H.\n |journal = Metallurgical and Materials Transactions B\n |volume = 42\n |page = 37\n |bibcode = 2011MMTB...42...37Y\n}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal\n |doi = 10.1007/s11837-010-0190-8\n |title = Solar-grade silicon production by metallothermic reduction\n |date = 2010\n |last1 = Yasuda|first1 = Kouji\n |last2 = Okabe|first2 = Toru H.\n |journal = JOM\n |volume = 62\n |issue = 12\n |page = 94\n |bibcode = 2010JOM....62l..94Y\n}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal\n |doi =10.1002/recl.19590781204\n |title =The preparation of pure silicon\n |date =2010\n |last1 =Van Der Linden\n |first1 =P.

Contrary to Siemens' batch process, FBR runs continuously, wasting fewer resources and requires less setup and downtime. It uses about 10 percent of the electricity consumed by a conventional rod reactor in the established Siemens process, as it does not waste energy by placing heated gas and silicon in contact with cold surfaces. In the FBR, silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>) is injected into the reactor from below and forms a fluidized bed together with the silicon seed particles that are fed from above. The gaseous silane then decomposes and deposits silicon on the seed particles. When the particles have grown to larger granules, they eventually sink to the bottom of the reactor where they are continuously withdrawn from the process.\n\nThe FBR manufacturing technology outputs polysilicon at 6N to 9N, a purity still higher than the 5N to 6N of ''upgraded metallurgical silicon'' (UMG-Si), a third technology used by the photovoltaic industry, that dispenses altogether with chemical purification, using metallurgical techniques instead. Currently most silicon for the photovoltaic market is produced by the Siemens process and only about 10 percent by the FBR technology, while UMG-Si accounts for about 2 percent. By 2020, however, IHS Technology predicts that market shares for FBR technology and UMG-Si will grow to 16.7 and 5.4 percent, respectively.<ref>IHS Technology [http://press.ihs.com/press-release/design-supply-chain/fluidized-bed-reactor-technology-stakes-its-claim-solar-polysilico Fluidized Bed Reactor Technology Stakes Its Claim in Solar Polysilicon Manufacturing], 7 May 2014</ref>\n\nThe company [[Renewable Energy Corporation|REC]] is one of the leading producers of silane and polysilicon using FBR technology.

To properly control the quantum mechanical properties, the purity of the silicon must be very high. Bulk silicon wafers used at the beginning of the integrated circuit making process must first be refined to a purity of 99.9999999% often referred to as \"9N\" for \"9 nines\", a process which requires repeated applications of refining technology.\n\nThe majority of silicon crystals grown for device production are produced by the [[Czochralski process]], (Cz-Si) It was the cheapest method available. However, single crystals grown by the Czochralski process contain impurities because the [[crucible]] containing the melt often dissolves. Historically, a number of methods have been used to produce ultra-high-purity silicon.\n\n==== Early purification techniques ====\n\nEarly silicon purification techniques were based on the fact that if silicon is melted and re-solidified, the last parts of the mass to solidify contain most of the impurities. The earliest method of silicon purification, first described in 1919 and used on a limited basis to make [[radar]] components during [[World War II]], involved crushing metallurgical grade silicon and then partially dissolving the silicon powder in an acid. When crushed, the silicon cracked so that the weaker impurity-rich regions were on the outside of the resulting grains of silicon. As a result, the impurity-rich silicon was the first to be dissolved when treated with acid, leaving behind a more pure product.\n\nIn [[zone melting]], also called zone refining, the first silicon purification method to be widely used industrially, rods of metallurgical grade silicon are heated to melt at one end. Then, the heater is slowly moved down the length of the rod, keeping a small length of the rod molten as the silicon cools and re-solidifies behind it. Since most impurities tend to remain in the molten region rather than re-solidify, when the process is complete, most of the impurities in the rod will have been moved into the end that was the last to be melted. This end is then cut off and discarded, and the process repeated if a still higher purity is desired.<ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ATFo8Pr67uIC&pg=PA33|page =33|title = Silicon: Evolution and future of a technology|isbn = 978-3-540-40546-7|author1 = Siffert|first1 = Paul|last2 = Krimmel|first2 = E.

Most silicon is used industrially without being separated into the element, and indeed often with comparatively little processing from natural occurrence. Over 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of [[silicate minerals]], which are compounds of silicon and oxygen, often with metallic ions when negatively charged silicate anions require cations to balance the charge. Many of these have direct commercial uses, such as clays, [[silica]] sand and most kinds of building stone. Thus, the vast majority of uses for silicon are as structural compounds, either as the silicate minerals or silica (crude silicon dioxide). Silicates are used in making [[Portland cement]] (made mostly of calcium silicates) which is used in [[mortar (masonry)|building mortar]] and modern [[stucco]], but more importantly, combined with silica sand, and gravel (usually containing silicate minerals like granite), to make the [[concrete]] that is the basis of most of the very largest industrial building projects of the modern world. {{sfn|Greenwood|1997|p=356}}\n\n'''Ceramics and glass.''' Silica is used to make [[fire brick]], a type of ceramic. Silicate minerals are also in whiteware [[ceramic]]s, an important class of products usually containing various types of fired [[clay]] minerals (natural aluminium phyllosilicates). An example is [[porcelain]] which is based on the silicate mineral [[kaolinite]]. Traditional [[glass]] (silica-based [[soda-lime glass]]) also functions in many of the same ways, and is also used for windows and containers. In addition, specialty silica based [[glass fiber]]s are used for [[optical fiber]], as well as to produce [[fiberglass]] for structural support and [[glass wool]] for thermal insulation.\n\n'''Artificial silicon compounds.''' Very occasional elemental silicon is found in nature, and also naturally-occurring compounds of silicon and carbon ([[silicon carbide]]) or nitrogen ([[silicon nitride]]) are found in stardust samples or meteorites in [[presolar grain]]s, but the oxidizing conditions of the inner planets of the solar system make planetary silicon compounds found there mostly silicates and silica. Free silicon, or compounds of silicon in which the element is covalently attached to hydrogen, boron, or elements other than oxygen, are mostly artificially produced. They are described below.\n\nSilicon compounds of more modern origin function as high-technology abrasives and new high-strength ceramics based upon [[silicon carbide]]. Silicon is a component of some [[superalloy]]s.\n\nAlternating silicon-oxygen chains with hydrogen attached to the remaining silicon bonds form the ubiquitous silicon-based polymeric materials known as [[silicone]]s. These compounds containing silicon-oxygen and occasionally silicon-carbon bonds have the capability to act as bonding intermediates between glass and organic compounds, and to form polymers with useful properties such as impermeability to water, flexibility and resistance to chemical attack. Silicones are often used in [[waterproofing]] treatments, [[molding (process)|molding]] compounds, mold-[[release agent]]s, mechanical seals, high temperature [[lubricant|greases]] and waxes, and [[caulking]] compounds. Silicone is also sometimes used in [[breast implant]]s, contact lenses, [[explosive]]s and [[pyrotechnics]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/prep.200700021 |title=Special Materials in Pyrotechnics: VI.

The presence of elemental silicon in molten iron acts as a sink for oxygen, so that the steel carbon content, which must be kept within narrow limits for each type of steel, can be more closely controlled. Ferrosilicon production and use is a monitor of the steel industry, and although this form of elemental silicon is grossly impure, it accounts for 80% of the world's use of free silicon. Silicon is an important constituent of [[electrical steel]], modifying its [[resistivity]] and [[ferromagnetic]] properties.\n\nThe properties of silicon can be used to modify alloys with metals other than iron. \"Metallurgical grade\" silicon is silicon of 95\u201399% purity. About 55% of the world consumption of metallurgical purity silicon goes for production of aluminium-silicon alloys ([[silumin]] alloys) for aluminium part [[Casting|casts]], mainly for use in the [[automotive industry]]. Silicon's importance in aluminium casting is that a significantly high amount (12%) of silicon in aluminium forms a [[eutectic mixture]] which solidifies with very little thermal contraction. This greatly reduces tearing and cracks formed from stress as casting alloys cool to solidity. Silicon also significantly improves the hardness and thus wear-resistance of aluminium.<ref name=\"diecasting\" /><ref name=USGS/>\n\n=== Electronics ===\n\n{{main article|Semiconductor device fabrication}}\n\n[[File:Silicon wafer with mirror finish.jpg|thumb|Silicon wafer with mirror finish]]\n\nMost elemental silicon produced remains as a ferrosilicon alloy, and only about 20% is refined to metallurgical grade purity (a total of 1.3\u20131.5 million metric tons/year). An estimated 15% of the world production of metallurgical grade silicon is further refined to semiconductor purity.<ref name=USGS/> However, the economic importance of this small very high-purity fraction (especially the ~ 5% which is processed to monocrystalline silicon for integrated circuits) is disproportionately large.\n\nPure [[monocrystalline silicon]] is used to produce [[Wafer (electronics)|silicon wafers]] used in the [[semiconductor industry]], in electronics, and in some high-cost and high-efficiency [[photovoltaic]] applications. Pure silicon is an [[intrinsic semiconductor]], which means that unlike metals, it conducts [[electron hole]]s and electrons released from atoms by heat; silicon's [[electrical conductivity]] increases with higher temperatures. Pure silicon has too low a conductivity (i.e., too high a [[resistivity]]) to be used as a circuit element in electronics. In practice, pure silicon is [[doping (semiconductors)|doped]] with small concentrations of certain other elements, which greatly increase its conductivity and adjust its electrical response by controlling the number and charge ([[electron hole|positive]] or [[electron|negative]]) of activated carriers. Such control is necessary for [[transistor]]s, [[solar cell]]s, [[semiconductor detector]]s, and other [[semiconductor device]]s used in the computer industry and other technical applications. In [[silicon photonics]], silicon can be used as a continuous wave [[Raman laser]] medium to produce coherent light, though it is ineffective as an everyday light source.\n\nIn common [[integrated circuit]]s, a wafer of monocrystalline silicon serves as a mechanical support for the circuits, which are created by doping and insulated from each other by thin layers of [[silicon dioxide|silicon oxide]], an insulator that is easily produced by exposing the element to oxygen under the proper conditions. Silicon has become the most popular material for both high power semiconductors and integrated circuits because it can withstand the highest temperatures and greatest electrical activity without suffering [[avalanche breakdown]] (an [[electron avalanche]] is created when heat produces free electrons and holes, which in turn pass more current, which produces more heat). In addition, the insulating oxide of silicon is not soluble in water, which gives it an advantage over [[germanium]] (an element with similar properties which can also be used in semiconductor devices) in certain fabrication techniques.<ref>[http://www.mpoweruk.com/semiconductors.htm Semiconductors Without the Quantum Physics]. Electropaedia</ref>\n\nMonocrystalline silicon is expensive to produce, and is usually justified only in production of integrated circuits, where tiny crystal imperfections can interfere with tiny circuit paths. For other uses, other types of pure silicon may be employed. These include [[hydrogenated amorphous silicon]] and upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon (UMG-Si) used in the production of low-cost, [[large-area electronics]] in applications such as [[liquid crystal display]]s and of large-area, low-cost, thin-film [[solar cells]]. Such semiconductor grades of silicon are either slightly less pure or polycrystalline rather than monocrystalline, and are produced in comparable quatities as the monocrystalline silicon: 75,000 to 150,000 metric tons per year.  The market for the lesser grade is growing more quickly than for monocrystalline silicon. By 2013, polycrystalline silicon production, used mostly in solar cells, was projected to reach 200,000 metric tons per year, while monocrystalline semiconductor grade silicon was expected to remain less than 50,000 tons/year.<ref name=USGS>Corathers, Lisa A.

Several manufacturers of mechanical watch movements have incorporated silicon parts, mainly in the escapements and balance wheel regions. Silicon hair-springs are becoming more common as are silicon escapement wheels and forks. Silicon has several desirable properties when used in these contexts; It is thermally stable, shock resistant, and requires little to no lubrication. Ulysse Nardin pioneered these applications, with Omega, Breguet, Patek, Rolex, Cartier, and Damasko following.<ref>[http://www.woundforlife.com/2014/04/23/technical-notes-silicon-hairspring Silicon hairspring]</ref> Most of these parts for watch movements are manufactured by [[deep reactive-ion etching]] (DRIE).<ref>[http://www.europastar.com/watch-knowledge/1003843153-the-silicon-revolution.html The Silicon revolution]</ref>\n\n== Biological role ==\n\n[[File:Radiolaria3434.JPG|thumb|Silica skeletons of [[radiolaria]] in false color.]]\n\nAlthough silicon is readily available in the form of [[silicate]]s, very few organisms use it directly. [[Diatom]]s, [[radiolaria]] and [[siliceous sponge]]s use [[biogenic silica]] as a structural material for skeletons. In more advanced plants, the silica [[phytolith]]s (opal phytoliths) are rigid microscopic bodies occurring in the cell; some plants, for example [[rice]], need silicon for their growth.<ref>{{cite book|chapter = Silicon|page = 856|isbn = 978-0-444-53181-0|title = Studies in Natural Products Chemistry|volume = 35 |first =Atta-ur-|last = Rahman}}</ref><ref name=\"abd\">{{cite journal|last1 = Exley|first1 = C|title = Silicon in life:A bioinorganic solution to bioorganic essentiality|journal = Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry|volume = 69|pages = 139\u2013144|date = 1998|doi = 10.1016/S0162-0134(97)10010-1|issue = 3}}</ref><ref name=\"plants\">{{cite journal|last1 =Epstein|first1 =Emanuel|title =SILICON|journal =Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology|volume =50|date =1999|pmid =15012222|doi =10.1146/annurev.arplant.50.1.641|pages =641\u2013664}}</ref> There is some evidence that silicon is important to nail, hair, bone and skin health,<ref>{{cite book|first1= Keith R.|last1= Martin|editor=Astrid Sigel|editor2=Helmut Sigel|editor3=Roland K.
