Brittle materials absorb relatively little [[energy]] prior to fracture, even those of high [[Strength of materials|strength]]. Breaking is often accompanied by a snapping sound. Brittle materials include most [[ceramic materials|ceramics]] and [[glass]]es (which do not deform plastically) and some [[polymer]]s, such as [[Polymethyl methacrylate|PMMA]] and [[polystyrene]]. Many [[steel]]s become brittle at low temperatures (see [[Ductile-brittle_transition#Ductile-brittle_transition_temperature|ductile-brittle transition temperature]]), depending on their composition and processing.\n\nWhen used in [[materials science]], it is generally applied to materials that fail when there is little or no evidence of [[plasticity (physics)|plastic deformation]] before failure. One proof is to match the broken halves, which should fit exactly since no plastic deformation has occurred.\n\nWhen a material has reached the limit of its strength, it usually has the option of either deformation or fracture.  A naturally [[malleable]] metal can be made stronger by impeding the mechanisms of plastic deformation (reducing [[grain size]], [[precipitation hardening]], [[work hardening]], etc.), but if this is taken to an extreme, fracture becomes the more likely outcome, and the material can become brittle.  Improving material [[toughness]] is therefore a balancing act.\n\n==Toughening==\nThis principle generalizes to other classes of material.  Naturally brittle materials, such as  [[glass]], are not difficult to toughen effectively.  Most such techniques involve one of two [[fracture toughening mechanisms|mechanisms]]: to deflect or absorb the tip of a propagating crack, or to create carefully controlled [[Stress (physics)#Residual stress|residual stresses]] so that cracks from certain predictable sources will be forced closed. The first principle is used in [[laminated glass]] where two sheets of glass are separated by an interlayer of [[polyvinyl butyral]], which as a [[viscoelastic]] polymer absorbs the growing crack. The second method is used in [[toughened glass]] and [[pre-stressed concrete]]. A demonstration of glass toughening is provided by [[Prince Rupert's Drop]]. Brittle [[polymers]] can be toughened by using metal particles to initiate crazes when a sample is stressed, a good example being [[high impact polystyrene|high-impact polystyrene]] or HIPS. The least brittle structural ceramics are [[silicon carbide]] (mainly by virtue of its high strength) and transformation-toughened [[zirconia]].\n\nA different philosophy is used in [[composite materials]], where brittle [[glass fibre]]s, for example, are embedded in a ductile matrix such as [[polyester resin]]. When strained, cracks are formed at the glass\u2013matrix interface, but so many are formed that much energy is absorbed and the material is thereby toughened. The same principle is used in creating [[metal matrix composite]]s.\n\n==Effect of pressure==\nGenerally, the ''[[brittle strength]]'' of a material can be increased by [[pressure]]. This happens as an example in the [[brittle-ductile transition zone]] at an approximate depth of {{convert|10|km}} in the [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]], at which rock becomes less likely to fracture, and more likely to deform [[Ductility|ductilely]] (see [[rheid]]).\n\n==Crack growth==\n[[Supersonic fracture]] is crack motion faster than the speed of sound in a brittle material.  This phenomenon was first discovered{{Citation needed|reason=when? in what material?|date=February 2011}} by scientists from the [[Max Planck Institute for Metals Research]] in [[Stuttgart]] ([[Markus J. Buehler]] and [[Huajian Gao]]) and [[IBM Almaden Research Center]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], California ([[Farid F. Abraham]]).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Izod impact strength test]]\n*[[Charpy impact test]]\n*[[Fractography]]\n*[[Forensic engineering]]\n*[[Ductility]]\n*[[Strengthening mechanisms of materials]]\n*[[Stress\u2013strain curve#Brittle materials|Stress\u2013strain curve]]\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book|last=Lewis|first=Peter Rhys|author2=Reynolds, K |author3=Gagg, C |title =Forensic Materials Engineering: Case studies | publisher=CRC Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-8493-1182-6}}\n* {{Cite book|last=R\u00f6sler|first=Joachim |author2=Harders, Harald |author3=B\u00e4ker, Martin |title = Mechanical behaviour of engineering materials: metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites|publisher=Springer|year=2007|isbn=978-3-642-09252-7}}\n\n[[Category:Continuum mechanics]]\n[[Category:Materials science]]"}]}}}}
