Hoses are also sometimes called ''[[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipes]]'' (the word ''pipe'' usually refers to a rigid tube, whereas a hose is usually a flexible one), or more generally ''[[tubing (material)|tubing]]''. The shape of a hose is usually [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] (having a [[circle|circular]] [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]]).  \n\nHose design is based on a combination of application and performance. Common factors are size, pressure rating, weight, length, straight hose or coilhose, and chemical compatibility. \n\nHoses are made from one or a combination of many different materials. Applications mostly use [[nylon]], [[polyurethane]], [[polyethylene]], [[PVC]], or synthetic or natural [[rubber]]s, based on the environment and pressure rating needed. In recent years, hoses can also be manufactured from special grades of polyethylene ([[LDPE]] and especially [[LLDPE]]). Other hose materials include [[PTFE]] ([[Teflon]]), [[stainless steel]] and other metals.\n\n==Reinforced rubber hose==\n[[Image:Series of Tubes.JPG|thumbnail|A reinforced series of tubes, these can withstand up to 10 bars of pressure]]\nTo achieve a better pressure resistance, hoses can be reinforced with fibers or steel cord. Commonly used reinforcement methods are braiding, spiraling, knitting and wrapping of fabric plies. The reinforcement increases the pressure resistance but also the stiffness. To obtain flexibility, corrugations or bellows are used. Usually, circumferential or helical reinforcement rings are applied to maintain these corrugated or bellowed structures under internal pressure.\n\n==Applications==\nHoses can be used in [[water]] or other [[liquid]] environments  or to convey [[air]] or other [[gas]]es. Hoses are used to carry fluids through air or fluid environments, and they are typically used with [[Clamp (tool)|clamp]]s, [[Tap (valve)|spigot]]s, [[flange]]s, and [[nozzle]]s to control fluid flow.\n\nSpecific applications include the following:\n* A [[garden hose]] is used to water plants in a [[garden]] or [[lawn]], or to convey water to a [[irrigation sprinkler|sprinkler]] for the same purpose.\n* A Tough Hose is used to water crops in [[agriculture]] for [[drip irrigation]]\n* A [[fire hose]] is used by [[firefighter]]s to convey water to the site of a [[fire]].\n* [[Air hose]]s are used in underwater [[diving]] to carry air from a surface compressor or from [[Diving cylinder|air tanks]]. (See also [[Snorkeling]].) Industrial uses for operating flexible machinery and worktable tooling such as pneumatic screw drivers,  grinders, staplers, etc.\n* [[Air hose|Hoses]] have been used in [[Westinghouse Air Brake Company|air brake systems]] ever since the technology was invented by [[George Westinghouse]] in 1868.  This includes:\n**[[Railway air brake|Railway air brake hoses]] used between [[locomotive]]s and [[railroad car]]s, and\n**[[Air brake (road vehicle)|Truck air brake hoses]] used between [[Tractor unit|tractors]] and [[semi-trailers]]\n* [[Air hose|Hoses]] have been used in [[Vacuum brake]] systems ever since the technology was invented in the mid-1860s\n** [[Vacuum brake|vacuum brake hoses]]\n* In building services, [[metal]] or [[plastic]] hoses are used to move water around a [[building]]; whilst [[air duct]]s are used to move air around (see [[air conditioning]]). They can also be used to take out vibration, and thermal or settlement movement.\n* Automotive hoses are used in [[automobile]]s to move fluids around for use in cooling, [[lubricant|lubrication]], and/or [[Hydraulic fluid|hydraulics]].  Hoses are also used to convey pressure or vacuum signals to control circuits or gauges, as well as conveying vacuum to heating, cooling, brake, and/or locking systems.\n* In [[chemistry]] and [[medicine]], hoses (usually called ''tubes'') are used to move liquid chemicals or gases around.\n* A [[Fuel line|fuel hose]] carries fuel.\n\nIn some cases, a rubber hose has been used as a weapon with which to beat somebody. This is the origin of the term [[Rubber-hose cryptanalysis]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hose coupling]], for joining one or more hoses or to equipment\n*[[Cut-off factor]]\n*[[Faucet]]\n*[[Pipe (material)|Pipe]]\n*[[Tubing (material)|Tubing]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Hoses| ]]"}]}}}}
