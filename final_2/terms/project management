A [[project]] is a temporary endeavor designed to produce a unique product, service or result with a defined beginning and end (usually time-constrained, and often constrained by funding or [[deliverables]]) undertaken to meet unique goals and objectives, typically to bring about beneficial change or added value.<ref>*''The Definitive Guide to Project Management''.

''Global Project Management Handbook''. McGraw-Hill Professional, 2006. ISBN 0-07-146045-4. p.1-4 states: \"''It was in the 1950s when project management was formally recognized as a distinct contribution arising from the management discipline.''\"</ref> In the United States, prior to the 1950s, projects were managed on an ad-hoc basis, using mostly [[Gantt chart]]s and informal techniques and tools. At that time, two mathematical [[Schedule (project management)|project-scheduling]] models were developed. The \"[[Critical Path Method]]\" (CPM) was developed as a joint venture between [[DuPont|DuPont Corporation]] and [[Remington Rand|Remington Rand Corporation]] for managing plant maintenance projects. And the \"[[Program Evaluation and Review Technique]]\" or PERT, was developed by the [[United States Navy]] in conjunction with the [[Lockheed Corporation]] and [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] as part of the [[Polaris missile]] submarine program.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Stauber | first1 = B.

CPM is used for projects that assume deterministic activity times; the times at which each activity will be carried out are known. PERT, on the other hand, allows for stochastic activity times; the times at which each activity will be carried out are uncertain or varied. Because of this core difference, CPM and PERT are used in different contexts. These mathematical techniques quickly spread into many private enterprises.\n[[File:Pert chart colored.svg|thumb|240px|[[PERT|PERT network chart]] for a seven-month project with five milestones]]\n\nAt the same time, as project-scheduling models were being developed, technology for project cost [[Estimation (project management)|estimating]], cost management and engineering economics was evolving, with pioneering work by Hans Lang and others. In 1956, the American Association of Cost Engineers (now [[AACE International]]; the Association for the Advancement of [[Cost Engineering]]) was formed by early practitioners of project management and the associated specialties of planning and scheduling, cost estimating, and cost/schedule control (project control). AACE continued its pioneering work and in 2006 released the first integrated process for portfolio, program and project management ([[Total Cost Management]] Framework).\n\nThe [[International Project Management Association]] (IPMA) was founded in Europe in 1967,<ref>Bjarne Kousholt (2007). ''Project Management \u2013. Theory and practice.''. Nyt Teknisk Forlag. ISBN 87-571-2603-8. p.59.</ref> as a federation of several national project management associations. IPMA maintains its federal structure today and now includes member associations on every continent except Antarctica. IPMA offers a Four Level Certification program based on the IPMA Competence Baseline (ICB).<ref>[http://www.ipma.ch/publication/Pages/ICB-IPMACompetenceBaseline.aspx ipma.ch]</ref> The ICB covers technical, contextual, and behavioral competencies.\n\nIn 1969, the [[Project Management Institute]] (PMI) was formed in the USA.<ref>F. L. Harrison, Dennis Lock (2004). ''Advanced project management: a structured approach''. Gower Publishing, Ltd., 2004. ISBN 0-566-07822-8. p.34.</ref> PMI publishes ''[[A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge]]'' (PMBOK Guide), which describes project management practices that are common to \"most projects, most of the time.\" PMI also offers multiple certifications.\n\n==Approaches==\nThere are a number of approaches for managing project activities including lean, iterative, incremental, and phased approaches.\n\nRegardless of the methodology employed, careful consideration must be given to the overall project objectives, timeline, and cost, as well as the roles and responsibilities of all participants and [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]].\n\n===The traditional approach ===\nA traditional phased approach identifies a sequence of steps to be completed.  In the \"traditional approach\",<ref name=\"wysocki\">{{cite book | title=Effective Project Management: Traditional, Adaptive, Extreme (Seventh Edition) | publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] | author=Wysocki, Robert K | year=2013 | isbn=978-1118729168}}</ref> five developmental components of a project can be distinguished (four stages plus control):[[File:Project Management (phases).png|thumb|right|320px|Typical development phases of an engineering project]]\n# initiation\n# [[project planning|planning]] and design\n# execution and construction\n# monitoring and controlling systems\n# completion and finish point\n\nMany industries use variations of these project stages. For example, when working on a [[brick-and-mortar]] design and construction, projects will typically progress through stages like pre-planning, conceptual design, schematic design, design development, construction drawings (or contract documents), and construction administration.  In [[software development]], this approach is often known as the [[waterfall model]],<ref name=\"Roy70\">Winston W. Royce (1970). [http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2003/cmsc838p/Process/waterfall.pdf \"Managing the Development of Large Software Systems\"] in: ''Technical Papers of Western Electronic Show and Convention ''(WesCon) August 25\u201328, 1970, Los Angeles, USA.</ref> i.e., one series of [[Task (project management)|tasks]] after another in linear sequence. In software development many organizations have adapted the [[Rational Unified Process]] (RUP) to fit this methodology, although RUP does not require or explicitly recommend this practice.  Waterfall development works well for small, well-defined projects, but often fails in larger projects of undefined and ambiguous nature. The [[Cone of Uncertainty]] explains some of this as the planning made on the initial phase of the project suffers from a high degree of uncertainty. This becomes especially true as software development is often the realization of a new or novel product. In projects where [[requirements]] have not been finalized and can change, [[requirements management]] is used to develop an accurate and complete definition of the behavior of software that can serve as the basis for software development.<ref name=\"Stellman05\">{{Cite book| last=Stellman | first=Andrew | last2=Greene | first2=Jennifer | title=Applied Software Project Management | url=http://www.stellman-greene.com/aspm/ | publisher=O'Reilly Media | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-596-00948-9 }}</ref> While the terms may differ from industry to industry, the actual stages typically follow common steps to [[problem solving]]\u2014\"defining the problem, weighing options, choosing a path, implementation and evaluation.\"\n\n===PRINCE2===\n{{Main article |PRINCE2}}\n[[File:Prince2 procces model .jpg|thumb|300px|The [[PRINCE2]] process model]]PRINCE2 is a structured approach to project management released in 1996 as a generic project management method.<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110822131357/http://www.ogc.gov.uk/methods_prince_2__background.asp OGC \u2013 PRINCE2 \u2013 Background]</ref> It combines the original PROMPT methodology (which evolved into the PRINCE methodology) with IBM's MITP (managing the implementation of the total project)  methodology. PRINCE2 provides a method for managing projects within a clearly defined framework.\n\nPRINCE2 focuses on the definition and delivery of products, in particular their quality requirements. As such, it defines a successful project as being output-oriented (not activity- or task-oriented) through creating an agreed set of products<ref name=managing>[Office for Government Commerce (1996) ''Managing Successful Projects with PRINCE2'', p14]</ref> that define the scope of the project and provides the basis for planning and control, that is, how then to coordinate people and activities, how to design and supervise product delivery, and what to do if products and therefore the scope of the project has to be adjusted if it does not develop as planned.\n\nIn the method, each process is specified with its key inputs and outputs and with specific goals and activities to be carried out to deliver a project's outcomes as defined by its Business Case. This allows for continuous assessment and adjustment when deviation from the Business Case is required.\n\nPRINCE2 provides a common language for all participants in the project. The governance framework of PRINCE2 \u2013 its roles and responsibilities \u2013 are fully described and require tailoring to suit the complexity of the project and skills of the organization.<ref name=managing/>\n\n===Critical chain project management===\n{{Main article |Critical chain project management}}\nCritical chain project management (CCPM) is a method of planning and managing project execution designed to deal with uncertainties inherent in managing projects, while taking into consideration limited availability of [[Resource (project management)|resources]] (physical, human skills, as well as management & support capacity) needed to execute projects.\n\nCCPM is an application of the [[theory of constraints]] (TOC) to projects. The goal is to increase the flow of projects in an organization ([[throughput]]). Applying the first three of the [[Theory of Constraints#The five focusing steps|five focusing steps]] of TOC, the system constraint for all projects is identified as are the resources. To exploit the constraint, tasks on the critical chain are given priority over all other activities. Finally, projects are planned and managed to ensure that the resources are ready when the critical chain tasks must start, subordinating all other resources to the critical chain.\n\nThe [[project plan]] should typically undergo [[resource leveling]], and the longest sequence of resource-constrained tasks should be identified as the critical chain. In some cases, such as managing contracted sub-projects, it is  advisable to use a simplified approach without resource leveling.\n\nIn multi-project environments, resource leveling should be performed across projects. However, it is often enough to identify (or simply select) a single \"drum\". The drum can be a resource that acts as a constraint across projects, which are staggered based on the availability of that single resource.\n\nOne can also use a \"virtual drum\" by selecting a task or group of tasks (typically [[integration points]]) and limiting the number of projects in execution at that stage.\n\n===Process-based management===\n{{Main article |Process-based management}}\nThe incorporation of process-based management has been driven by the use of Maturity models such as the [[OPM3]] and the [[CMMI]] (capability maturity model integration; see [[:Image:Capability Maturity Model.jpg|this example]] of a predecessor) and [[ISO 15504|ISO/IEC15504]] (SPICE \u2013 software process improvement and capability estimation). Unlike SEI's CMM, the OPM3 maturity model describes how to make project management processes capable of performing successfully, consistently, and predictably in order to enact the strategies of an organization [http://www.opmexperts.com/opm3/ .]\n\n===Lean project management===\n{{Main article |Lean project management}}\nLean project management uses the principles from [[lean manufacturing]] to focus on delivering value with less waste and reduced time.\n\n===Extreme project management/Megaproject===\n{{Main article |Extreme project management|Megaproject}}\n[[File:Xp-loop with time frames.svg|thumb|180px|Planning and [[feedback]] loops in [[Extreme programming]] (XP) with the time frames of the multiple loops.]]In critical studies of project management it has been noted that several [[PERT]] based models are not well suited for the multi-project company environment of today.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Most of them are aimed at very large-scale, one-time, non-routine projects, and currently all kinds of management are expressed in terms of projects.\n\nUsing complex models for \"projects\" (or rather \"tasks\") spanning a few weeks has been proven to cause unnecessary costs and low maneuverability in several cases.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} \nThe generalization of Extreme Programming to other kinds of projects is [[extreme project management]], which may be used in combination with the [[process modeling]] and management principles of [[human interaction management]].\n\n===Benefits realization management===\n{{Main article |Benefits realisation management}}\nBenefits realization management (BRM) enhances normal project management techniques through a focus on outcomes (the benefits) of a project rather than products or outputs, and then measuring the degree to which that is happening to keep a project on track.  This can help to reduce the risk of a completed project being a failure by delivering agreed upon requirements/outputs but failing to deliver the '''''benefits''''' of those requirements.\n\nIn addition, BRM practices aim to ensure the alignment between project outcomes and business strategies. The effectiveness of these practices is supported by recent research evidencing BRM practices influencing project success from a strategic perspective across different countries and industries.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Serra | first1 = C.

Under BRM the agreement might be to achieve a specified reduction in staff hours required to process and maintain staff data.\n\n== {{anchor|Project development stages}} Processes==\n[[File:Project development stages.jpg|thumb|230px|The project development stages<ref name=\"VA03\">{{cite web|work=VA Office of Information and Technology |year=2003 |url=http://www.ppoe.oit.va.gov/docs/VA_IT_PM_Guide.pdf |title=Project Management Guide |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114104001/http://www.ppoe.oit.va.gov/docs/VA_IT_PM_Guide.pdf |archivedate=January 14, 2009 }}</ref>]]\nTraditionally, project management includes a number of elements: four to five project management process groups, and a control system. Regardless of the methodology or terminology used, the same basic project management processes or stages of development will be used. Major process groups generally include:<ref name=\"PMI 10\">[[Project Management Institute|PMI]] (2010). ''A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge'' p.27-35</ref>\n* Initiation\n* Planning \n* Production or execution\n* Monitoring and controlling\n* Closing\n\nIn project environments with a significant exploratory element (e.g., [[research and development]]), these stages may be supplemented with decision points (go/no go decisions) at which the project's continuation is debated and decided. An example is the [[Phase\u2013gate model]].\n\n===Initiating===\n[[File:Initiating Process Group Processes.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Initiating process group processes<ref name=\"VA03\"/>]]\nThe initiating processes determine the nature and scope of the project.<ref>Peter Nathan, Gerald Everett Jones (2003). ''PMP certification for dummies''. p.63.</ref> If this stage is not performed well, it is unlikely that the project will be successful in meeting the business\u2019 needs. The key project controls needed here are an understanding of the business environment and making sure that all necessary controls are incorporated into the project. Any deficiencies should be reported and a recommendation should be made to fix them.\n\nThe initiating stage should include a plan that encompasses the following areas:\n* analyzing the business [[requirement|needs/requirements]] in measurable goals\n* reviewing of the current [[business operations|operations]]\n* [[financial analysis]] of the costs and benefits including a [[budget]]\n* [[stakeholder analysis]], including users, and support personnel for the project\n* [[project charter]] including costs, tasks, deliverables, and schedules\n\n===Planning===\nAfter the initiation stage, the project is planned to an appropriate level of detail (see [[:File:Planning Process Group Activities.jpg|example of a flow-chart]]).<ref name=\"VA03\"/> The main purpose is to plan time, cost and resources adequately to estimate the work needed and to effectively manage risk during project execution. As with the Initiation process group, a failure to adequately plan greatly reduces the project's chances of successfully accomplishing its goals.\n\n[[Project planning]] generally consists of<ref>{{cite book  | author = [[Harold Kerzner]] | year = 2003 | title = Project Management: A Systems Approach to Planning, Scheduling, and Controlling | edition = 8th | publisher = Wiley | isbn = 0-471-22577-0}}</ref>\n* determining how to plan (e.g. by level of detail or [[Rolling Wave planning]]);\n* developing the [[scope statement]];\n* selecting the planning team;\n* identifying deliverables and creating the work breakdown structure;\n* identifying the activities needed to complete those deliverables and networking the activities in their logical sequence;\n* estimating the resource requirements for the activities;\n* estimating time and cost for activities;\n* developing the schedule;\n* developing the budget;\n* risk planning;\n* gaining formal approval to begin work.\n\nAdditional processes, such as planning for communications and for scope management, identifying roles and responsibilities, determining what to purchase for the project and holding a kick-off meeting are also generally advisable.\n\nFor [[new product development]] projects, conceptual design of the operation of the final product may be performed concurrent with the project planning activities, and may help to inform the planning team when identifying deliverables and planning activities.\n\n===Executing===\n[[File:Executing Process Group Processes.jpg|thumb|320px|Executing process group processes<ref name=\"VA03\"/>]]\nThe execution/implementation phase ensures that the project management plan's deliverables are executed accordingly. This phase involves proper allocation, co-ordination and management of human resources and any other resources such as material and budgets. The output of this phase is the project deliverables.\n\n===Monitoring and controlling===\n[[File:Monitoring and Controlling Process Group Processes.jpg|thumb|320px|Monitoring and controlling process group processes<ref name=\"VA03\"/>]]Monitoring and controlling consists of those processes performed to observe project execution so that potential problems can be identified in a timely manner and corrective action can be taken, when necessary, to control the execution of the project. The key benefit is that project performance is observed and measured regularly to identify variances from the project management plan.\n\nMonitoring and controlling includes:<ref name=\"JPL00\">James P. Lewis (2000). ''The project manager's desk reference: : a comprehensive guide to project planning, scheduling, evaluation, and systems.'' p.185</ref>\n* Measuring the ongoing project activities ('where we are');\n* Monitoring the project variables (cost, effort, scope, etc.) against the project management plan and the project performance baseline (''where we should be'');\n* Identifying corrective actions to address issues and risks properly (''How can we get on track again'');\n* Influencing the factors that could circumvent integrated change control so only approved changes are implemented.\n\nIn multi-phase projects, the monitoring and control process also provides feedback between project phases, in order to implement corrective or preventive actions to bring the project into compliance with the project management plan.\n\nProject maintenance is an ongoing process, and it includes:<ref name=\"PMI 10\"/>\n* Continuing support of end-users\n* Correction of errors\n* Updates to the product over time\n[[File:Project Management (project control).png|thumb|240px|Monitoring and controlling cycle]]\nIn this stage, [[auditor]]s should pay attention to how effectively and quickly user problems are resolved.\n\nOver the course of any construction project, the work scope may change. Change is a normal and expected part of the construction process. Changes can be the result of necessary design modifications, differing site conditions, material availability, contractor-requested changes, value engineering and impacts from third parties, to name a few. Beyond executing the change in the field, the change normally needs to be documented to show what was actually constructed. This is referred to as change management. Hence, the owner usually requires a final record to show all changes or, more specifically, any change that modifies the tangible portions of the finished work. The record is made on the contract documents \u2013 usually, but not necessarily limited to, the design drawings. The end product of this effort is what the industry terms as-built drawings, or more simply, \"as built.\" The requirement for providing them is a norm in construction contracts. Construction document management is a highly important task undertaken with the aid an online or desktop software system, or maintained through physical documentation. The increasing legality pertaining to the construction industries maintenance of correct documentation has caused the increase in the need for document management systems.\n\nWhen changes are introduced to the project, the viability of the project has to be re-assessed. It is important not to lose sight of the initial goals and targets of the projects. When the changes accumulate, the forecasted result may not justify the original proposed investment in the project. Successful project management identifies these components, and tracks and monitors progress so as to stay within time and budget frames already outlined at the commencement of the project.\n\n===Closing===\n[[File:Closing Process Group Processes.jpg|thumb|270px|Closing process group processes.<ref name=\"VA03\"/>]]\nClosing includes the formal acceptance of the project and the ending thereof.  Administrative activities include the archiving of the files and documenting lessons learned.\n\nThis phase consists of:<ref name=\"PMI 10\"/>\n* '''Contract closure''': Complete and settle each contract (including the resolution of any open items) and close each contract applicable to the project or project phase.\n* '''Project close''': Finalize all activities across all of the process groups to formally close the project or a project phase\n\nAlso included in this phase is the Post Implementation Review. This is a vital phase of the project for the project team to learn from experiences and apply to future projects. Normally a Post Implementation Review consists of looking at things that went well and analyzing things that went badly on the project to come up with lessons learned.\n\n===Project controlling and project control systems===\nProject controlling (also known as [[Cost engineering|Cost Engineering]])\n{{tnull|Citation needed|reason{{=}}''Project Controls cover a number of elements such as Design, Cost, Schedule, Quality and Risk. A number of disciplines cover this area.''|date{{=}}{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}}} \nshould be established as an independent function in project management.

The following methods of project controlling can be applied: \n \n* investment analysis\n* cost\u2013benefit analysis\n* value benefit analysis\n* expert surveys\n* simulation calculations\n* risk-profile analysis\n* surcharge calculations\n* [[Milestone (project management)|milestone]] trend analysis\n* cost trend analysis\n* target/actual-comparison<ref>Steinle, Bruch, Lawa (1995). Projektmanagement. FAZ Verlagsbereich Wirtschaftsb\u00fccher. p.136\u2013143</ref>\n\nProject control is that element of a project that keeps it on track, on-time and within budget.<ref name=\"JPL00\"/>  Project control begins early in the project with planning and ends late in the project with post-implementation review, having a thorough involvement of each step in the process.  Projects may be audited or reviewed while the project is in progress. Formal audits are generally risk or compliance-based and management will direct the objectives of the audit. An examination may include a comparison of approved project management processes with how the project is actually being managed.<ref>Cynthia Snyder, Frank Parth (2006). ''Introduction to IT Project Management.'' p.393-397</ref> Each project should be assessed for the appropriate level of control needed: too much control is too time consuming, too little control is very risky.  If project control is not implemented correctly, the cost to the business should be clarified in terms of errors and fixes.\n\nControl systems are needed for cost, [[risk]], quality, communication, time, change, procurement, and human resources.  In addition, auditors should consider how important the projects are to the [[financial statement]]s, how reliant the stakeholders are on controls, and how many controls exist.  Auditors should review the development process and procedures for how they are implemented.  The process of development and the quality of the final product may also be assessed if needed or requested.  A business may want the auditing firm to be involved throughout the process to catch problems earlier on so that they can be fixed more easily.  An auditor can serve as a controls consultant as part of the development team or as an independent auditor as part of an audit.\n\nBusinesses sometimes use formal systems development processes.  These help assure systems are developed successfully.  A formal process is more effective in creating strong controls, and auditors should review this process to confirm that it is well designed and is followed in practice.  A good formal systems development plan outlines:\n* A [[strategy]] to align development with the organization's broader objectives\n* Standards for new systems\n* Project management policies for timing and [[budgeting]]\n* Procedures describing the process\n* Evaluation of quality of change\n\n==Topics==\n\n=== Project managers ===\nA [[project manager]] is a professional in the field of project management. Project managers can have the responsibility of the planning, execution, and closing of any project, typically relating to [[construction industry]], engineering, architecture, [[computing]], and telecommunications. Many other fields of production engineering, design engineering, and heavy industrial have project managers.\n\nA project manager is the person accountable for accomplishing the stated project objectives. Key project management responsibilities include creating clear and attainable project objectives, building the project requirements, and managing the [[Project management triangle|triple constraint]] for projects, which is cost, time, and scope.\n\nA project manager is often a client representative and has to determine and implement the exact needs of the client, based on knowledge of the firm they are representing. The ability to adapt to the various internal procedures of the contracting party, and to form close links with the nominated representatives, is essential in ensuring that the key issues of cost, time, quality and above all, client satisfaction, can be realized.\n\n===Project management types===\nProject management can apply to any project, but it is often tailored to accommodate the specific  needs of different and highly specialized industries.  For example, the construction industry, which focuses on the delivery of things like buildings, roads, and bridges, has developed its own specialized form of project management that it refers to as ''Construction project management'' and for which project managers can become trained and certified in.<ref name=Contruction_Project_Management>{{cite web|title=Certified Construction Manager|url=http://cmaanet.org/certified-construction-manager|publisher=CMAA|accessdate=23 November 2013}}</ref>  The Information technology industry has also evolved to develop its own form of Project management that is referred to as ''IT Project management'' and which specializes in the delivery of technical assets and services that are required to pass through various lifecycle phases such as planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. Similarly, and closely related, ''digital project management'' specializes in the leading, planning, organizing, motivating and delivery of web-enabled projects, typically for marketing clients, usually with a direct consumer touchpoint and delivered through screens or connected devices by digital agencies, studios, or internal web teams.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedigitalprojectmanager.com/digital-project-management/|title=Digital Project Management: what is it?

This allows project plans to become very thorough and highly repeatable, with the specific intent to increase quality, lower delivery costs, and lower time to deliver project results.\n\n===Risk Management===\n{{Main article |Project risk management}}\nThe United States Department of Defense states; \"Cost, Schedule, Performance, and Risk,\" are the four elements through which Department of Defense acquisition professionals make trade-offs and track program status.<ref>{{cite web|title=DoDD 5000.01|url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/500001p.pdf|publisher=United States Department of Defense|accessdate=20 November 2007}}</ref> There are also [[Project management#International standards|international standards]].  Risk management applies proactive identification (see [[Risk management tools|tools]]) of future problems and understanding of their consequences allowing [[Predictive analytics|predictive]] decisions about projects.\n\n===Work breakdown structure===\n{{Main article |Work breakdown structure}}\nThe [[work breakdown structure]] (WBS) is a [[tree structure]] that shows a subdivision of effort required to achieve an objective\u2014for example a program, project, and contract. The WBS may be hardware-, product-, service-, or [[Business process|process]]-oriented (see an example in a [[:Image:NASA NF 533 reporting structure.jpg|NASA reporting structure (2001)]]).<ref name=\"NASA01\">[http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?Internal_ID=N_PR_9501_002D_&page_name=Chp2&format=PDF NASA NPR 9501.2D]. May 23, 2001.</ref>\n\nA WBS can be developed by starting with the end objective and successively subdividing it into manageable components in terms of size, [[Duration (project management)|duration]], and responsibility (e.g., systems, subsystems, components, tasks, sub-tasks, and work packages), which include all steps necessary to achieve the objective.<ref name=\"Stellman05\"/>\n\nThe work breakdown structure provides a common framework for the natural development of the overall planning and control of a contract and is the basis for dividing work into definable increments from which the statement of work can be developed and technical, schedule, cost, and labor hour reporting can be established.<ref name=\"NASA01\"/>\nThe work breakdown structure can be displayed in two forms\none in form of a table with subdivision of tasks two in form of an organisational chart.\n\n===International standards===\nThere have been several attempts to develop project management standards, such as:\n* ISO 21500: 2012 \u2013 Guidance on project management.  This is the first project management ISO.\n* ISO 31000: 2009 \u2013 Risk management.
