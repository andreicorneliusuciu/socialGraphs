It is composed of one or more [[electrochemical cell]]s. The term \"accumulator\" is used as it [[accumulator (energy)|accumulates]] and  [[energy storage|stores energy]] through a reversible [[electrochemical]] [[Chemical reaction|reaction]]. Rechargeable batteries are produced in many different shapes and sizes, ranging from [[Button cell#Rechargeable variants|button cells]] to megawatt systems connected to [[grid energy storage|stabilize]] an electrical distribution network. Several different combinations of electrode materials and electrolytes are used, including [[Lead\u2013acid battery|lead\u2013acid]], [[Nickel\u2013cadmium battery|nickel cadmium]] (NiCd), [[Nickel\u2013metal hydride battery|nickel metal hydride]] (NiMH), [[lithium-ion battery|lithium ion]] (Li-ion), and [[lithium polymer battery|lithium ion polymer]] (Li-ion polymer).\n\nRechargeable batteries typically initially cost more than [[disposable batteries]], but have a much lower [[total cost of ownership]] and [[environmental impact]], as they can be recharged inexpensively many times before they need replacing. Some rechargeable battery types are available in the same [[list of battery sizes|sizes]] and voltages as disposable types, and can be used interchangeably with them.\n\n== Usage and applications ==\n[[file:Lithium-Ion Cell cylindric.JPG|right|thumb|Cylindrical cell (18650) prior to assembly. Several thousand of them ([[Lithium ion battery|lithium ion]]) form the [[Tesla Model S]] battery (see [[Gigafactory 1#Background|Gigafactory]]).]]\n[[file:Lithium Ionen Akku \u00dcberwachungselektronik.jpg|right|thumb|[[Lithium ion battery]] monitoring electronics (over- and discharge protection)]]\nDevices which use rechargeable batteries include [[Car battery|automobile starters]], portable consumer devices, light vehicles (such as [[wheelchair#Electric-powered wheelchairs|motorized wheelchairs]], [[golf carts]], [[electric bicycles]], and electric [[forklifts]]), tools, [[uninterruptible power supply|uninterruptible power supplies]], and [[battery storage power station]]s. Emerging applications in [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid internal combustion-battery]] and [[battery electric vehicle|electric vehicles]] drive the technology to reduce cost, weight, and size, and increase lifetime.<ref>David Linden, Thomas B. Reddy (ed). Handbook Of Batteries 3rd Edition. McGraw-Hill, New York, 2002 ISBN 0-07-135978-8 chapter 22.</ref>\n\nOlder rechargeable batteries self-discharge relatively rapidly, and require charging before first use; some newer [[Low self-discharge NiMH battery|low self-discharge NiMH batteries]] hold their charge for many months, and are typically sold factory-charged to about 70% of their rated capacity.\n\n[[Battery storage power station]]s use rechargeable batteries for load-leveling (storing electric energy at times of low demand for use during peak periods) and for [[renewable energy]] uses (such as storing power generated from [[photovoltaic array]]s during the day to be used at night). Load-leveling reduces the maximum power which a plant must be able to generate, reducing capital cost and the need for [[peaking power plant]]s.\n\nThe US [[National Electrical Manufacturers Association]] estimated in 2006 that US demand for rechargeable batteries was growing twice as fast as demand for disposables.<ref>\n{{cite web|url= http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/reduce/epr/products/batteries.htm \n|title= Batteries Product Stewardship &#124; Wastes &#124; EPA \n|publisher= Epa.gov |date= 2006-06-28 |accessdate= 2012-08-14}}\n</ref>\n\nSmall rechargeable batteries can power portable electronic devices, power tools, appliances, and so on. Heavy-duty batteries  power electric vehicles, ranging from [[Electric motorcycles and scooters|scooters]] to [[Electric locomotives#Battery locomotives|locomotives]] and ships. They are used in [[Distributed generation|distributed electricity generation]] and in [[stand-alone power system]]s.\n\n== Charging and discharging ==\n[[File:Solar AA charger 01 Pengo.jpg|thumb|A solar-powered charger for rechargeable AA batteries]]\n{{Further information|Battery charger}}\nDuring charging, the positive active material is [[oxidized]], producing [[electron]]s, and the negative material is [[redox|reduced]], consuming electrons. These electrons constitute the [[electric current|current]] flow in the external [[electrical network|circuit]]. The [[electrolyte]] may serve as a simple buffer for internal [[ion]] flow between the [[electrode]]s, as in [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion]] and [[nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium]] cells, or it may be an active participant in the [[electrochemical]] reaction, as in [[lead\u2013acid battery|lead\u2013acid]] cells.\n\nThe energy used to charge rechargeable batteries usually comes from a [[battery charger]] using AC [[mains electricity]], although some are equipped to use a vehicle's 12-volt DC power outlet.  Regardless,  to store energy in a secondary cell, it has to be connected to a DC voltage source. The negative terminal of the cell has to be connected to the negative terminal of the voltage source and the positive terminal of the voltage source with the positive terminal of the battery.  Further, the voltage output of the source must be higher than that of the battery, but not ''much'' higher: the greater the difference between the power source and the battery's voltage capacity, the faster the charging process, but also the greater the risk of overcharging and damaging the battery.\n\nChargers take from a few minutes to several hours to charge a battery. Slow \"dumb\" chargers without voltage or temperature-sensing capabilities will charge at a low rate, typically taking 14 hours or more to reach a full charge.  Rapid chargers can typically charge cells in two to five hours, depending on the model, with the fastest taking as little as fifteen minutes.  Fast chargers must have multiple ways of detecting when a cell reaches full charge (change in terminal voltage, temperature, etc.) to stop charging before harmful overcharging or overheating occurs.  The fastest chargers often incorporate cooling fans to keep the cells from overheating.\n\n[[File:Secondary Cell Diagram.svg|left|frame|Diagram of the charging of a secondary cell or battery.]]\n\nBattery charging and discharging rates are often discussed by referencing a \"C\" rate of current. The C rate is that which would theoretically fully charge or discharge the battery in one hour.  For example, [[trickle charging]] might be performed at C/20 (or a  \"20 hour\" rate), while typical charging and discharging may occur at C/2 (two hours for full capacity). The available capacity of electrochemical cells varies depending on the discharge rate. Some energy is lost in the internal resistance of cell components (plates, electrolyte, interconnections), and the rate of discharge is limited by the speed at which chemicals in the cell can move about. For lead-acid cells, the relationship between time and discharge rate is described by [[Peukert's law]]; a lead-acid cell that can no longer sustain a usable terminal voltage at a high current may still have usable capacity, if discharged at a much lower rate. Data sheets for rechargeable cells often list the discharge capacity on 8-hour or 20-hour or other stated time; cells for [[uninterruptible power supply]] systems may be rated at 15 minute discharge.\n\nBattery manufacturers' technical notes often refer to voltage per cell (VPC) for the individual cells that make up the battery.  For example, to charge a 12 V lead-acid battery (containing 6 cells of 2 V each) at 2.3 VPC requires a voltage of 13.8 V across the battery's terminals.\n\nNon-rechargeable alkaline and zinc\u2013carbon cells output 1.5V when new, but this voltage drops with use. Most NiMH AA and AAA cells are rated at 1.2 V, but have a flatter discharge curve than alkalines and can usually be used in equipment designed to use alkaline batteries.\n\n===Damage from cell reversal===\nSubjecting a discharged cell to a current in the direction which tends to discharge it further to the point the positive and negative terminals switch polarity causes a condition called cell reversal.\nGenerally, pushing current through a discharged cell in this way causes undesirable and irreversible chemical reactions to occur, resulting in permanent damage to the cell.\nCell reversal can occur under a number of circumstances, the two most common being:\n* When a battery or cell is connected to a charging circuit the wrong way around.\n* When a battery made of several cells connected in series is deeply discharged.\nIn the latter case, the problem occurs due to the different cells in a battery having slightly different capacities.\nWhen one cell reaches discharge level ahead of the rest, the remaining cells will force the current through the discharged cell.\n\nMany battery-operated devices have a low-voltage cutoff that prevents deep discharges from occurring that might cause cell reversal.\n\nCell reversal can occur to a weakly charged cell even before it is fully discharged.\nIf the battery drain current is high enough, the cell's internal resistance can create a resistive voltage drop that is greater than the cell's forward [[electromotive force|emf]].\nThis results in the reversal of the cell's polarity while the current is flowing.<ref>Sequeira, C.A.C. [https://books.google.com/books?id=wbzWOllJSewC Solid state batteries], [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], Scientific Affairs Division, pp. 242-247, 254-259</ref><ref>AEROSPACE CORP EL SEGUNDO CA CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS LAB.

[http://www.repairfaq.org/ELE/F_NiCd_Memory.html NiCd Batteries do NOT have \"memory\"], RepairFAQ.org website, 24 September 1996.</ref> it may be desirable to fully discharge a battery. To avoid damage from the cell reversal effect, it is necessary to access each cell separately: each cell is individually discharged by connecting a load clip across the terminals of each cell, thereby avoiding cell reversal.\n\n=== Damage during storage in fully discharged state ===\nIf a multi-cell battery is fully discharged, it will often be damaged due to the cell reversal effect mentioned above.\nIt is possible however to fully discharge a battery without causing cell reversal\u2014either by discharging each cell separately, or by allowing each cell's internal leakage to dissipate its charge over time.\n\nEven if a cell is brought to a fully discharged state without reversal, however, damage may occur over time simply due to remaining in the discharged state. An example of this is the [[Desulfation|sulfation that occurs in lead-acid batteries]] that are left sitting on a shelf for long periods.\nFor this reason it is often recommended to charge a battery that is intended to remain in storage, and to maintain its charge level by periodically recharging it.\nSince damage may also occur if the battery is overcharged, the optimal level of charge during storage is typically around 30% to 70%.\n\n=== Depth of discharge ===\n{{Main article|Depth of discharge}}\nDepth of discharge (DOD) is normally stated as a percentage of the nominal ampere-hour capacity; 0% DOD means no discharge. Seeing as the usable capacity of a battery system depends on the rate of discharge and the allowable voltage at the end of discharge, the depth of discharge must be qualified to show the way it is to be measured. Due to variations during manufacture and aging, the DOD for complete discharge can change over time or number of [[charge cycle]]s. Generally a rechargeable battery system will tolerate more charge/discharge cycles if the DOD is lower on each cycle.<ref>Reddy, ''Handbook of Batteries'' page 22-20</ref>\n\n===Lifespan and cycle stability===\nIf batteries are used repeatedly even without mistreatment, they lose capacity as the number of charge cycles increases, until they are eventually considered to have reached the end of their useful life.\n\n[[Lithium iron phosphate battery|Lithium iron phosphate batteries]] reach according to the manufacturer more than 5000 cycles at respective depth of discharge of 70%.<ref>[http://www.3xe-electric-cars.com/images/stories/virtuemart/product/wb-lyp100aha-1.png 3xe-electric-cars.com:] Winston Battery, Herstellerangaben, abgerufen am 31.

The positive and negative are made up of different materials, with the positive exhibiting a [[redox|reduction]] potential and the negative having an [[oxidation]] potential. The sum of these potentials is the standard cell potential or [[voltage]].\n\nIn [[primary cell]]s the positive and negative electrodes are known as the [[cathode]] and [[anode]], respectively. Although this convention is sometimes carried through to rechargeable systems\u2014especially with [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion]] cells, because of their origins in primary lithium cells\u2014this practice can lead to confusion. In rechargeable cells the positive electrode is the cathode on discharge and the anode on charge, and vice versa for the negative electrode.\n\n== Types ==\n{{See also|List of battery types}}\n{{See also|Comparison of battery types}}\nThe [[lead\u2013acid battery]], invented in 1859 by French physicist [[Gaston Plant\u00e9]], is the oldest type of rechargeable battery. Despite having a very low energy-to-weight ratio and a low energy-to-volume ratio, its ability to supply high [[surge current]]s means that the cells have a relatively large [[power-to-weight ratio]]. These features, along with the low cost, makes it attractive for use in motor vehicles to provide the high current required by [[automobile self starter|automobile starter motors]].\n\nThe [[nickel\u2013cadmium battery]] (NiCd) was invented by [[Waldemar Jungner]] of Sweden in 1899. It uses [[nickel oxide hydroxide]] and metallic [[cadmium]] as [[electrode]]s. Cadmium is a toxic element, and was banned for most uses by the European Union in 2004. Nickel\u2013cadmium batteries have been almost completely superseded by nickel\u2013metal hydride (NiMH) batteries.\n\nThe [[nickel\u2013metal hydride battery]] (NiMH) became available in 1989.<ref>Katerina E. Aifantis et al, ''High Energy Density Lithium Batteries: Materials, Engineering, Applications'' Wiley-VCH, 2010 ISBN 3-527-32407-0 page 66</ref> These are now a common consumer and industrial type. The battery has a hydrogen-absorbing [[alloy]] for the negative [[electrode]] instead of [[cadmium]].\n\nThe [[lithium-ion battery]] was introduced in the market in 1991, and it is the choice in most consumer electronics and has the best [[energy density]] and a very slow [[loss of charge]] when not in use.\n\n[[Lithium polymer battery|Lithium-ion polymer batteries]] are light in weight, offer slightly higher energy density than Li-ion at slightly higher cost, and can be made in any shape.

''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RSsJAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA445 Illustrated Guide to the National Electrical Code]'', p. 445 (Cengage Learning 2011).</ref>  Several alternatives to rechargeable batteries exist or are under development. For uses such as [[clockwork radio|portable radios]], rechargeable batteries may be replaced by clockwork mechanisms which are wound up by hand, driving [[electrical generator|dynamos]], although this system may be used to charge a battery rather than to operate the radio directly. [[Flashlight]]s may be driven by a dynamo directly. For transportation, [[uninterruptible power supply]] systems and laboratories, [[flywheel energy storage]] systems store energy in a spinning rotor for conversion to electric power when needed; such systems may be used to provide large pulses of power that would otherwise be objectionable on a common electrical grid.\n\n[[Ultracapacitor]]s\u2014capacitors of extremely high value\u2014 are also used; an [[electric screwdriver]] which charges in 90 seconds and will drive about half as many screws as a device using a rechargeable battery was introduced in 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohgizmo.com/2007/10/01/coleman-flashcell-cordless-screwdriver-recharges-in-just-90-seconds/ |title=Capacitor-powered electric screwdriver, 2007 |publisher=Ohgizmo.com |date=2005-07-24 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> and similar flashlights have been produced.  In keeping with the concept of ultracapacitors, [[Betavoltaics|betavoltaic]] batteries may be utilized as a method of providing a trickle-charge to a secondary battery, greatly extending the life and energy capacity of the battery system being employed; this type of arrangement is often referred to as a \"hybrid betavoltaic power source\" by those in the industry.<ref>[http://citylabs.net/ Welcome to City Labs], CityLabs.net website.</ref>\n\nUltracapacitors are being developed for transportation, using a large capacitor to store energy instead of the rechargeable battery banks used in [[hybrid vehicles]]. One drawback of capacitors compared to batteries is that the terminal voltage drops rapidly; a capacitor that has 25% of its initial energy left in it will have one-half of its initial voltage. By contrast, battery systems tend to have a terminal voltage that does not decline rapidly until nearly exhausted. The undesirable characteristic complicates the design of power electronics for use with ultracapacitors. However, there are potential benefits in cycle efficiency, lifetime, and weight compared with rechargeable systems. China started using ultracapacitors on two commercial bus routes in 2006; one of them is route 11 in [[Shanghai]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070105022719/http://www.52bus.com/article/special/200608/special_6.html  \u8d85\u7ea7\u7535\u5bb9\u516c\u4ea4\u8f66\u4e13\u9898 (Super capacitor buses topics)], 52Bus.com website, August 2006 (in Chinese, archived page).</ref>\n\n[[Flow battery|Flow batteries]], used for specialized applications, are recharged by replacing the electrolyte liquid. A flow battery can be considered to be a type of rechargeable [[fuel cell]].\n\n==Research==\nLithium Ion batteries normally have an anode made of graphite. Using an anode made of silicon (Si) can increase the capacity up to 6 times, because the Si-anode can accept much more Lithium-ion than a graphite-anode. A problem was, that the Si-anode expands 300\u2013400% when charged. The Si-anode had only a small lifespan. Researchers of the university of Stuttgart (institute of photovoltaic (IPV), Prof. Dr. J\u00fcrgen H. Werner and his team) found a way making the Si-anode porous, so that accepting so many Lithium-ion will not longer increase the volume of the Si-anode, so that the lifespan of the battery with Si-anode is now four times higher than batteries with graphite-anode. The battery is ready for production.<ref>[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369702116300888  The potential of silicon anode based lithium ion batteries, sciencedirect.com, July 2016.]</ref><ref>[http://www.oekonews.at/index.php?mdoc_id=1109734  Gr\u00f6\u00dfere Reichweite und l\u00e4ngere Lebensdauer f\u00fcr E-Fahrzeuge, oekonews.at, September 2016.]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|energy}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Battery pack]]\n* [[Comparison of battery types]]\n* [[Energy storage]]\n* [[List of battery types]]\n* [[List of energy densities]]\n* [[Metal\u2013air electrochemical cell]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Belli, Brita.
