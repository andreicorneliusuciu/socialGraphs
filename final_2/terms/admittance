It is defined as the [[multiplicative inverse|inverse]] of [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]. The [[SI]] unit of admittance is the [[siemens (unit)|siemens]] (symbol S). [[Oliver Heaviside]] coined the term ''admittance'' in December 1887.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.68.155115|title=Immittance matching for multidimensional open-system photonic crystals|year=2003|last1=Ushida|first1=Jun|last2=Tokushima|first2=Masatoshi|last3=Shirane|first3=Masayuki|last4=Gomyo|first4=Akiko|last5=Yamada|first5=Hirohito|journal=Physical Review B|volume=68|issue=15|arxiv = cond-mat/0306260 |bibcode = 2003PhRvB..68o5115U }}</ref>\n\nAdmittance is defined as\n:<math>Y \\equiv \\frac{1}{Z} \\,</math>\n\nwhere \n:''Y'' is the admittance, measured in [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]]\n:''Z'' is the impedance, measured in [[Ohm (unit)|ohms]]\n\nThe synonymous unit [[mho]], and the symbol \u2127 (an upside-down uppercase omega \u03a9), are also in common use.\n\n[[electrical resistance|Resistance]] is a measure of the opposition of a circuit to the flow of a steady current, while impedance takes into account not only the resistance but also dynamic effects (known as [[Electrical reactance|reactance]]).
