As it is a [[fermion]], no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, in accordance with the [[Pauli exclusion principle]].<ref name=\"curtis74\"/> Like all matter, electrons have properties of [[Wave\u2013particle duality|both particles and waves]]: they can collide with other particles and can be [[electron diffraction|diffracted]] like light. The [[#Quantum properties|wave properties of electrons]] are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a larger [[De Broglie wavelength]] for a given energy.\n\nElectrons play an essential role in numerous [[physics|physical]] phenomena, such as [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], and [[thermal conductivity]], and they also participate in [[gravitation]]al, [[Lorentz force|electromagnetic]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] [[Fundamental interaction|interactions]].<ref name=\"anastopoulos1\" /> Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding [[electric field]], and if that electron is moving relative to an observer it will generate a [[magnetic field]]. Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources (not those self-produced) will affect the motion of an electron according to the [[Lorentz force law]]. Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are accelerated. Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as [[Plasma (physics)|electron plasma]] by the use of electromagnetic fields. Special [[telescope]]s can detect electron plasma in outer space. Electrons are involved in many applications such as [[electronics]], [[Electron beam welding|welding]], [[cathode ray tube]]s, [[electron microscope]]s, [[radiation therapy]], [[Free-electron laser|lasers]], [[gaseous ionization detectors]] and [[particle accelerator]]s.\n\nInteractions involving electrons with other subatomic particles are of interest in fields such as [[chemistry]] and [[nuclear physics]]. The [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]] interaction between the positive [[proton]]s within [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and the negative electrons without, allows the composition of the two known as [[atom]]s. Ionization or differences in the proportions of negative electrons versus positive nuclei changes the [[binding energy]] of an atomic system. The exchange or sharing of the electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of [[chemical bond]]ing.<ref name=Pauling/> In 1838, British natural philosopher [[Richard Laming]] first hypothesized the concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge to explain the [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] of atoms.<ref name=\"arabatzis\"/> Irish physicist [[George Johnstone Stoney]] named this charge 'electron' in 1891, and [[J. J. Thomson]] and his team of British physicists identified it as a particle in 1897.<ref name=\"thomson\"/><ref name=\"dahl\">[[#refDahl1997|Dahl (1997:122\u2013185).]]</ref><ref name=\"wilson\"/>  Electrons can also participate in [[nuclear reaction]]s, such as [[stellar nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthesis in stars]], where they are known as [[beta particle]]s. Electrons can be created through [[beta decay]] of [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]] and in high-energy collisions, for instance when [[cosmic ray]]s enter the atmosphere.  The [[antiparticle]] of the electron is called the [[positron]]; it is identical to the electron except that it carries electrical and other [[charge (physics)|charges]] of the opposite sign. When an [[Electron\u2013positron annihilation|electron collides with a positron]], both particles can be totally [[annihilation|annihilated]], producing [[gamma ray]] [[photon]]s.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of electromagnetic theory|label 1=History of electromagnetism}}\n\nThe [[Ancient Greece#Science and technology|ancient Greeks]] noticed that [[amber]] attracted small objects when rubbed with fur.

If the particles swap position, the wave function inverts its sign.]]\nElectrons are [[identical particles]] because they cannot be distinguished from each other by their intrinsic physical properties. In quantum mechanics, this means that a pair of interacting electrons must be able to swap positions without an observable change to the state of the system. The wave function of fermions, including electrons, is antisymmetric, meaning that it changes sign when two electrons are swapped; that is, {{nowrap|''\u03c8''(''r''<sub>1</sub>, ''r''<sub>2</sub>) {{=}} \u2212''\u03c8''(''r''<sub>2</sub>, ''r''<sub>1</sub>)}}, where the variables ''r''<sub>1</sub> and ''r''<sub>2</sub> correspond to the first and second electrons, respectively.

This is responsible for the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state. This principle explains many of the properties of electrons.

However, electron microscopes are expensive instruments that are costly to maintain.\n\nTwo main types of electron microscopes exist: [[Transmission electron microscopy|transmission]] and [[scanning electron microscope|scanning]]. Transmission electron microscopes function like [[overhead projector]]s, with a beam of electrons passing through a slice of material then being projected by lenses on a [[Reversal film|photographic slide]] or a [[charge-coupled device]].  Scanning electron microscopes [[Raster scan|rasteri]] a finely focused electron beam, as in a TV set, across the studied sample to produce the image. Magnifications range from 100\u00d7 to 1,000,000\u00d7 or higher for both microscope types. The [[scanning tunneling microscope]] uses quantum tunneling of electrons from a sharp metal tip into the studied material and can produce atomically resolved images of its surface.<ref name=\"bozzola_1999\">\n{{cite book\n | last = Bozzola | first = J.J.\n | last2 = Russell | first2 = L.D.\n | year = 1999\n | title = Electron Microscopy: Principles and Techniques for Biologists\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=RqSMzR-IXk0C&pg=PA12\n | publisher = [[Jones & Bartlett Learning|Jones & Bartlett Publishers]]\n | pages = 12, 197\u2013199\n | isbn = 0-7637-0192-0\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n | last = Flegler | first = S.L.\n | last2 = Heckman Jr. | first2 = J.W.\n | last3 = Klomparens | first3 = K.L.\n | year = 1995\n | title = Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy: An Introduction\n | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]\n | pages = 43\u201345 | edition = Reprint\n | isbn = 0-19-510751-9\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n | last = Bozzola | first = J.J.\n | last2 = Russell | first2 = L.D.\n | year = 1999\n | title = Electron Microscopy: Principles and Techniques for Biologists\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=RqSMzR-IXk0C&pg=PA9\n | publisher = [[Jones & Bartlett Learning|Jones & Bartlett Publishers]]\n | edition = 2nd | page = 9\n | isbn = 0-7637-0192-0\n}}</ref>\n\n===Other applications===\nIn the [[free-electron laser]] (FEL), a [[relativistic electron beam]] passes through a pair of [[undulator]]s that contain arrays of [[dipole magnet]]s whose fields point in alternating directions.
