Many laptops add rows of smaller keys above the Function key line to add keys on a non-standard size keyboard. On this row of smaller keys, the position of the Delete key is positioned at or near the right-hand end. On Apple's line of laptops (e.g. the [[MacBook]] and [[MacBook Pro]]), the forward delete function can be achieved using the {{key press|[[Fn key|Fn]]|backspace}} key combination.\n\nThe Delete key is typically smaller and less-conveniently located than the Backspace key, and on keyboards where space is limited, for example those omitting the [[numeric keypad]] or [[virtual keyboard]]s on mobile devices, it is often omitted altogether.\n\n==Uses==\nWhen struck on a [[computer keyboard]] during text or command editing, the delete key ({{Keypress|Delete}} or {{Keypress|Del}}, known less ambiguously as ''forward delete'', discards the character ahead of the [[cursor (computers)|cursor]]'s position, moving all following characters one position \"back\" towards the freed letterspace. The key is also used by many [[GUI]] applications to request deletion of the currently-selected object, for example a file in a [[file browser]] or a block of text in a [[word processor]].\n\nThe delete key often works as a generic command to remove a selected object, such as an image embedded in a document (on [[Apple Keyboard]]s, both the forward delete key and the delete (backspace) key have the same effect when pressed while an object is selected).<ref name=\"Mac Forward Delete\"/>\n\nOn [[Unix-like]] systems, the delete key is usually mapped to ESC<tt>[3~</tt> which is the [[VT220]] escape code for the \"[[delete character]]\" key.{{clarify|date=July 2011}}<ref>{{cite web | title=9.8 Keyboard configuration | work=Debian Policy Manual | url=http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html#s9.8}}</ref>\n\nThe delete key, on many modern motherboards, also functions to open the [[BIOS]] setup screen when pressed after starting the computer.\n\nIn GUI applications where the Delete key is enabled, especially in file browsers, pressing it does not necessarily immediately delete the selected object, but often a confirmation [[dialog box]] will appear to allow the user to cancel the deletion, or the object may instead be silently moved to a \"[[trash (computing)|trash folder]]\" or equivalent, so that it can be recovered later. In other GUI contexts, the [[Undo]] function can often reverse a deletion.\n\n\n==Alternative Key Mapping==\nAs many Apple keyboards lack a dedicated key for the forward delete function, Mac users wishing to have a dedicated forward delete key can reassign the forward-delete function to a different key using various third-party apps, such as [[DoubleCommand]] or [[PowerKey]].  For example, installing and enabling the DoubleCommand app allows the user to use the {{Keypress|Backslash}}, {{Keypress|Capslock}} or numeric keypad {{Keypress|Enter}} keys as a forward delete key.<ref>Soundforge DoubleCommand download page, http://doublecommand.sourceforge.net/features.html Accessed 2016-11-10</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Control-Alt-Delete]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Keyboard}}\n{{keyboard keys}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Delete Key}}\n[[Category:Computer keys]]"}]}}}}
