If electron flow is inhibited by broken conductors, damaged components, or excessive [[electrical resistance|resistance]], the circuit is \"open\".   \n\nDevices that can be used to perform continuity tests include [[multimeter]]s which measure current and specialized [[continuity tester]]s which are cheaper, more basic devices, generally with a simple [[light bulb]] that lights up when current flows.\n\nAn important application is the continuity test of a bundle of wires so as to find the two ends belonging to a particular one of these wires; there will be a negligible resistance between the \"right\" ends, and only between the \"right\" ends.\n\n==External links ==\n*[http://www.acmehowto.com/howto/homemaintenance/electrical/continuitytest.php acmehowto.com] - continuity test\n\n[[Category:Hardware testing]]"}]}}}}
