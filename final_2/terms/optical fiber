This is because a single fiber can carry much more data than electrical cables such as standard [[Cat-5|category 5]] Ethernet cabling, which typically runs at 100 Mbit/s or 1 Gbit/s speeds. Fiber is also immune to electrical interference; there is no cross-talk between signals in different cables, and no pickup of environmental noise. Non-armored fiber cables do not conduct electricity, which makes fiber a good solution for protecting communications equipment in [[high voltage]] environments, such as [[power generation]] facilities, or metal communication structures prone to [[lightning]] strikes. They can also be used in environments where explosive fumes are present, without danger of ignition. [[Wiretapping]] (in this case, [[fiber tapping]]) is more difficult compared to electrical connections, and there are concentric dual-core fibers that are said to be tap-proof.<ref name=\"Siemens Fiber Optics\">[http://www.automation.siemens.com/net/html_76/produkte/040_ie_fc_glasleitungen.htm Siemen's claim to a fiber optic line that cannot be tapped].

This allows the streaming of audio over light, using the [[TOSLINK]] protocol.\n\n====Advantages over copper wiring====\nThe advantages of optical fiber communication with respect to copper wire systems are:\n\n;Broad bandwidth: A single optical fiber can carry over 3,000,000 full-duplex voice calls or 90,000 TV channels.\n\n;Immunity to electromagnetic interference: Light transmission through optical fibers is unaffected by other [[electromagnetic radiation]] nearby. The optical fiber is electrically non-conductive, so it does not act as an antenna to pick up electromagnetic signals.

Optical fibers can be strung on poles alongside high voltage power cables.\n\n;Material cost and theft prevention: Conventional cable systems use large amounts of copper. Global copper prices experienced [[2000s commodities boom#Copper|a boom]] in the 2000s, and copper has been a target of [[metal theft]].\n\n;Security of information passed down the cable: Copper can be tapped with very little chance of detection.\n\n===Sensors===\n{{Main article|Fiber optic sensor}}\nFibers have many uses in remote sensing. In some applications, the sensor is itself an optical fiber. In other cases, fiber is used to connect a non-fiberoptic sensor to a measurement system. Depending on the application, fiber may be used because of its small size, or the fact that no [[electrical power]] is needed at the remote location, or because many sensors can be [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] along the length of a fiber by using different wavelengths of light for each sensor, or by sensing the time delay as light passes along the fiber through each sensor. Time delay can be determined using a device such as an ''[[optical time-domain reflectometer]]''.\n\nOptical fibers can be used as sensors to measure [[deformation (mechanics)|strain]], [[temperature]], [[pressure]] and other quantities by modifying a fiber so that the property to measure modulates the [[intensity (physics)|intensity]], [[phase (waves)|phase]], [[polarization (waves)|polarization]], [[wavelength]], or transit time of light in the fiber. Sensors that vary the intensity of light are the simplest, since only a simple source and detector are required. A particularly useful feature of such fiber optic sensors is that they can, if required, provide distributed sensing over distances of up to one meter. In contrast, highly localized measurements can be provided by integrating miniaturized sensing elements with the tip of the fiber.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 24599822\n| year = 2014\n| author1 = Kostovski\n| first1 = G\n| title = The optical fiber tip: An inherently light-coupled microscopic platform for micro- and nanotechnologies\n| journal = Advanced Materials\n| volume = 26\n| issue = 23\n| pages = 3798\u2013820\n| last2 = Stoddart\n| first2 = P.

A major benefit of extrinsic sensors is their ability to reach otherwise inaccessible places. An example is the measurement of temperature inside [[aircraft]] [[jet engine]]s by using a fiber to transmit [[radiation]] into a radiation [[pyrometer]] outside the engine. Extrinsic sensors can be used in the same way to measure the internal temperature of [[electrical transformer]]s, where the extreme [[electromagnetic field]]s present make other measurement techniques impossible. Extrinsic sensors measure vibration, rotation, displacement, velocity, acceleration, torque, and twisting. A solid state version of the gyroscope, using the interference of light, has been developed. The ''[[fiber optic gyroscope]] (FOG)'' has no moving parts, and exploits the ''[[Sagnac effect]]'' to detect mechanical rotation.\n\nCommon uses for fiber optic sensors includes advanced intrusion detection security systems. The light is transmitted along a fiber optic sensor cable placed on a fence, pipeline, or communication cabling, and the returned signal is monitored and analyzed for disturbances. This return signal is digitally processed to detect disturbances and trip an alarm if an intrusion has occurred.\n\nOptical fibers are widely used as components of optical chemical sensors and optical [[biosensors]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Florinel-Gabriel |last=B\u0103nic\u0103 |title=Chemical Sensors and Biosensors: Fundamentals and Applications |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=Chichester |year=2012 |at= Ch. 18\u201320 |isbn=978-0-470-71066-1}}</ref>\n\n===Power transmission===\nOptical fiber can be used to transmit power using a [[photovoltaic cell]] to convert the light into electricity.<ref>[http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/the-smarter-grid/electricity-over-glass IEEE Spectrum: Electricity Over Glass].

They are used as [[light tube|light guide]]s in medical and other applications where bright light needs to be shone on a target without a clear line-of-sight path. In some buildings, optical fibers route sunlight from the roof to other parts of the building (see [[nonimaging optics]]). [[Optical fiber lamp]]s are used for illumination in decorative applications, including [[Commercial signage|sign]]s, [[art]], toys and artificial [[Christmas tree]]s. [[Swarovski]] boutiques use optical fibers to illuminate their crystal showcases from many different angles while only employing one light source. Optical fiber is an intrinsic part of the light-transmitting concrete building product, [[LiTraCon]].\n\n[[File:Use of optical fiber in a lamp..JPG|thumb|Use of optical fiber in a decorative lamp or nightlight.]]\nOptical fiber is also used in imaging optics. A coherent bundle of fibers is used, sometimes along with lenses, for a long, thin imaging device called an [[endoscope]], which is used to view objects through a small hole. Medical endoscopes are used for minimally invasive exploratory or surgical procedures. Industrial endoscopes (see [[fiberscope]] or [[borescope]]) are used for inspecting anything hard to reach, such as jet engine interiors. Many [[microscopes]] use fiber-optic light sources to provide intense illumination of samples being studied.\n\nIn [[spectroscopy]], optical fiber bundles transmit light from a spectrometer to a substance that cannot be placed inside the spectrometer itself, in order to analyze its composition. A spectrometer analyzes substances by bouncing light off and through them. By using fibers, a spectrometer can be used to study objects remotely.<ref>{{cite journal |title=In situ real-time monitoring of a fermentation reaction using a fiber-optic FT-IR probe |journal=Spectroscopy |date=June 2001 |first=Zaid |last=Al Mosheky |author2=Melling, Peter J.  |author3=Thomson, Mary A.  |url=http://www.remspec.com/pdfs/SP5619.pdf |format=PDF|volume= 16|issue =6|page=15}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Reaction monitoring in small reactors and tight spaces |first=Peter |last=Melling |author2=Thomson, Mary |journal=American Laboratory News |date=October 2002 |url=http://www.remspec.com/pdfs/amlab1002.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |chapter=Fiber-optic probes for mid-infrared spectrometry |first=Peter J. |last=Melling |author2=Thomson, Mary |title=Handbook of Vibrational Spectroscopy |editors=Chalmers, John M.; Griffiths, Peter R.

Rare-earth-doped optical fibers can be used to provide signal [[amplifier|amplification]] by splicing a short section of doped fiber into a regular (undoped) optical fiber line. The doped fiber is [[optical pumping|optically pumped]] with a second laser wavelength that is coupled into the line in addition to the signal wave. Both wavelengths of light are transmitted through the doped fiber, which transfers energy from the second pump wavelength to the signal wave. The process that causes the amplification is [[stimulated emission]].\n\nOptical fiber is also widely exploited as a nonlinear medium. The glass medium supports a host of nonlinear optical interactions, and the long interaction lengths possible in fiber facilitate a variety of phenomena, which are harnessed for applications and fundamental investigation.<ref name=\"Agrawal2012\">{{Cite book | isbn = 0123970237 | title = Nonlinear Fiber Optics, Fifth Edition | last1 = Govind | first1 = Agrawal | year = <!--replace this comment with the publication year-->  | pages =  }}</ref> Conversely, fiber nonlinearity can have deleterious effects on optical signals, and measures are often required to minimize such unwanted effects.\n\nOptical fibers doped with a [[wavelength shifter]] collect [[scintillator|scintillation]] light in [[physics experiment]]s.\n\n[[Iron sights#Fiber optic|Fiber optic sight]]s for handguns, rifles, and shotguns use pieces of optical fiber to improve visibility of markings on the sight.\n\n==Principle of operation==\n[[File:Fiber-engineerguy.ogv|thumb|An overview of the operating principles of the optical fiber]]\nAn optical fiber is a cylindrical [[dielectric waveguide]] ([[insulator (electrical)|nonconducting]] waveguide) that transmits light along its axis, by the process of [[total internal reflection]]. The fiber consists of a ''core'' surrounded by a [[cladding (fiber optics)|cladding]] layer, both of which are made of [[dielectric]] materials.<ref name=RPP/> To confine the optical signal in the core, the [[refractive index]] of the core must be greater than that of the cladding. The boundary between the core and cladding may either be abrupt, in ''[[step-index profile|step-index fiber]]'', or gradual, in ''[[graded-index fiber]]''.\n\n===Index of refraction===\n{{Main article|Refractive index}}\nThe index of refraction (or refractive index) is a way of measuring the [[speed of light]] in a material. Light travels fastest in a [[vacuum]], such as in outer space. The speed of light in a vacuum is about 300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) per second. The refractive index of a medium is calculated by dividing the speed of light in a vacuum by the speed of light in that medium. The refractive index of a vacuum is therefore 1, by definition. A typical singlemode fiber used for telecommunications has a cladding made of pure silica, with an index of 1.444 at 1,500&nbsp;nm, and a core of doped silica with an index around 1.4475.<ref name=RPP>{{cite web  |title=Fibers |url=https://www.rp-photonics.com/fibers.html |work=[[Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology]] |publisher=RP Photonics |first=R\u00fcdiger |last=Paschotta |accessdate=Feb 22, 2015}}</ref> The larger the index of refraction, the slower light travels in that medium. From this information, a simple rule of thumb is that a signal using optical fiber for communication will travel at around 200,000 [[kilometers]] per second. To put it another way, the signal will take 5 [[milliseconds]] to travel 1,000 kilometers in fiber. Thus a phone call carried by fiber between Sydney and New York, a 16,000-kilometer distance, means that there is a minimum delay of 80 milliseconds (about <math>\\tfrac {1}{12}</math> of a second) between when one caller speaks and the other hears. (The fiber in this case will probably travel a longer route, and there will be additional delays due to communication equipment switching and the process of encoding and decoding the voice onto the fiber).\n\n===Total internal reflection===\n{{Main article|Total internal reflection}}\nWhen light traveling in an optically dense medium hits a boundary at a steep angle (larger than the [[critical angle (optics)|critical angle]] for the boundary), the light is completely reflected. This is called total internal reflection. This effect is used in optical fibers to confine light in the core. Light travels through the fiber core, bouncing back and forth off the boundary between the core and cladding. Because the light must strike the boundary with an angle greater than the critical angle, only light that enters the fiber within a certain range of angles can travel down the fiber without leaking out. This range of angles is called the [[acceptance cone]] of the fiber. The size of this acceptance cone is a function of the refractive index difference between the fiber's core and cladding.\n\nIn simpler terms, there is a maximum angle from the fiber axis at which light may enter the fiber so that it will propagate, or travel, in the core of the fiber. The [[sine]] of this maximum angle is the [[numerical aperture]] (NA) of the fiber. Fiber with a larger NA requires less precision to splice and work with than fiber with a smaller NA. Single-mode fiber has a small NA.\n\n===Multi-mode fiber===\n[[File:Optical-fibre.svg|thumb|The propagation of light through a [[multi-mode optical fiber]].]]\n[[File:Laser in fibre.jpg|thumb|A laser bouncing down an [[poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] rod, illustrating the total internal reflection of light in a multi-mode optical fiber.]]\n{{Main article|Multi-mode optical fiber}}\nFiber with large core diameter (greater than 10&nbsp;micrometers) may be analyzed by [[geometrical optics]]. Such fiber is called ''multi-mode fiber'', from the electromagnetic analysis (see below). In a step-index multi-mode fiber, [[ray (optics)|rays]] of light are guided along the fiber core by total internal reflection. Rays that meet the core-cladding boundary at a high angle (measured relative to a line [[surface normal|normal]] to the boundary), greater than the [[critical angle (optics)|critical angle]] for this boundary, are completely reflected. The critical angle (minimum angle for total internal reflection) is determined by the difference in index of refraction between the core and cladding materials. Rays that meet the boundary at a low angle are refracted from the [[core (optical fiber)|core]] into the cladding, and do not convey light and hence information along the fiber. The critical angle determines the [[guided ray|acceptance angle]] of the fiber, often reported as a [[numerical aperture]]. A high numerical aperture allows light to propagate down the fiber in rays both close to the axis and at various angles, allowing efficient coupling of light into the fiber. However, this high numerical aperture increases the amount of [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] as rays at different angles have different [[optical path length|path lengths]] and therefore take different times to traverse the fiber.\n\n[[File:Optical fiber types.svg|thumb|Optical fiber types.]]In graded-index fiber, the index of refraction in the core decreases continuously between the axis and the cladding. This causes light rays to bend smoothly as they approach the cladding, rather than reflecting abruptly from the core-cladding boundary. The resulting curved paths reduce multi-path dispersion because high angle rays pass more through the lower-index periphery of the core, rather than the high-index center. The index profile is chosen to minimize the difference in axial propagation speeds of the various rays in the fiber. This ideal index profile is very close to a [[parabola|parabolic]] relationship between the index and the distance from the axis.\n\n===Single-mode fiber===\n[[File:Singlemode fibre structure.svg|thumb|The structure of a typical [[single-mode fiber]].<br />\n1.

Jacket: 400&nbsp;\u00b5m dia.]]\n{{Main article|Single-mode optical fiber}}\nFiber with a core diameter less than about ten times the [[wavelength]] of the propagating light cannot be modeled using geometric optics. Instead, it must be analyzed as an [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] structure, by solution of [[Maxwell's equations]] as reduced to the [[electromagnetic wave equation]]. The electromagnetic analysis may also be required to understand behaviors such as speckle that occur when [[coherence (physics)|coherent]] light propagates in multi-mode fiber. As an optical waveguide, the fiber supports one or more confined [[transverse mode]]s by which light can propagate along the fiber. Fiber supporting only one mode is called ''single-mode'' or ''mono-mode fiber''. The behavior of larger-core multi-mode fiber can also be modeled using the wave equation, which shows that such fiber supports more than one mode of propagation (hence the name). The results of such modeling of multi-mode fiber approximately agree with the predictions of geometric optics, if the fiber core is large enough to support more than a few modes.\n\nThe waveguide analysis shows that the light energy in the fiber is not completely confined in the core. Instead, especially in single-mode fibers, a significant fraction of the energy in the bound mode travels in the cladding as an [[evanescent wave]].\n\nThe most common type of single-mode fiber has a core diameter of 8\u201310 micrometers and is designed for use in the [[near infrared]]. The mode structure depends on the wavelength of the light used, so that this fiber actually supports a small number of additional modes at visible wavelengths. Multi-mode fiber, by comparison, is manufactured with core diameters as small as 50 micrometers and as large as hundreds of micrometers. The [[normalized frequency (fiber optics)|normalized frequency]] ''V'' for this fiber should be less than the first zero of the [[Bessel function]] ''J''<sub>0</sub> (approximately 2.405).\n\n===Special-purpose fiber===\nSome special-purpose optical fiber is constructed with a non-cylindrical core and/or cladding layer, usually with an elliptical or rectangular cross-section. These include [[polarization-maintaining optical fiber|polarization-maintaining fiber]] and fiber designed to suppress [[whispering gallery mode]] propagation. Polarization-maintaining fiber is a unique type of fiber that is commonly used in fiber optic sensors due to its ability to maintain the polarization of the light inserted into it.\n\n[[Photonic-crystal fiber]] is made with a regular pattern of index variation (often in the form of cylindrical holes that run along the length of the fiber). Such fiber uses [[diffraction]] effects instead of or in addition to total internal reflection, to confine light to the fiber's core. The properties of the fiber can be tailored to a wide variety of applications.\n\n==Mechanisms of attenuation==\n[[File:Zblan transmit.jpg|thumb|Light attenuation by [[ZBLAN]] and silica fibers]]\n{{Main article|Transparent materials}}\nAttenuation in fiber optics, also known as transmission loss, is the reduction in intensity of the light beam (or signal) as it travels through the transmission medium. Attenuation coefficients in fiber optics usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the relatively high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission media. The medium is usually a fiber of silica glass that confines the incident light beam to the inside. Attenuation is an important factor limiting the transmission of a digital signal across large distances. Thus, much research has gone into both limiting the attenuation and maximizing the amplification of the optical signal.\nEmpirical research has shown that attenuation in optical fiber is caused primarily by both [[scattering]] and [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]]. Single-mode optical fibers can be made with extremely low loss. Corning's SMF-28 fiber, a standard single-mode fiber for telecommunications wavelengths, has a loss of 0.17&nbsp;dB/km at 1550&nbsp;nm.<ref name=\"CorningSMF28ULL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.corning.com/opticalfiber/products/SMF-28_ULL_fiber.aspx |title=Corning SMF-28 ULL optical fiber|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}</ref> For example, an 8&nbsp;km length of SMF-28 transmits nearly 75% of light at 1,550&nbsp;nm. It has been noted that if ocean water was as clear as fiber, one could see all the way to the bottom even of the Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean, a depth of 36,000 feet.<ref name=\"Jachetta2007\">{{cite book |last= Williams |first=E.

Rough and irregular surfaces, even at the molecular level, can cause light rays to be reflected in random directions. This is called [[diffuse reflection]] or [[light scattering|scattering]], and it is typically characterized by wide variety of reflection angles.\n\n[[Light scattering]] depends on the [[wavelength]] of the light being scattered. Thus, limits to spatial scales of visibility arise, depending on the frequency of the incident light-wave and the physical dimension (or spatial scale) of the scattering center, which is typically in the form of some specific micro-structural feature. Since [[visible spectrum|visible]] light has a wavelength of the order of one [[micrometre|micrometer]] (one millionth of a meter) scattering centers will have dimensions on a similar spatial scale.\n\nThus, attenuation results from the [[incoherent scatter]]ing of light at internal [[interface (chemistry)|surfaces and interface]]s. In (poly)crystalline materials such as metals and ceramics, in addition to pores, most of the internal surfaces or interfaces are in the form of [[grain boundaries]] that separate tiny regions of crystalline order. It has recently been shown that when the size of the scattering center (or grain boundary) is reduced below the size of the wavelength of the light being scattered, the scattering no longer occurs to any significant extent. This phenomenon has given rise to the production of [[transparent ceramics|transparent ceramic materials]].\n\nSimilarly, the scattering of light in optical quality glass fiber is caused by molecular level irregularities (compositional fluctuations) in the glass structure. Indeed, one emerging school of thought is that a glass is simply the limiting case of a polycrystalline solid. Within this framework, \"domains\" exhibiting various degrees of short-range order become the building blocks of both metals and alloys, as well as glasses and ceramics. Distributed both between and within these domains are micro-structural defects that provide the most ideal locations for light scattering. This same phenomenon is seen as one of the limiting factors in the transparency of IR missile domes.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Archibald, P.S.  |author2=Bennett, H.E. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Scattering from infrared missile domes|journal=Opt.

Primary material considerations include both electrons and molecules as follows:\n\n* At the electronic level, it depends on whether the electron orbitals are spaced (or \"quantized\") such that they can absorb a quantum of light (or photon) of a specific wavelength or frequency in the ultraviolet (UV) or visible ranges. This is what gives rise to color.\n* At the atomic or molecular level, it depends on the frequencies of atomic or molecular vibrations or chemical bonds, how close-packed its atoms or molecules are, and whether or not the atoms or molecules exhibit long-range order. These factors will determine the capacity of the material transmitting longer wavelengths in the infrared (IR), far IR, radio and microwave ranges.\n\nThe design of any optically transparent device requires the selection of materials based upon knowledge of its properties and limitations. The [[crystal structure|Lattice]] [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] characteristics observed at the lower frequency regions (mid IR to far-infrared wavelength range) define the long-wavelength transparency limit of the material. They are the result of the interactive [[coupling]] between the motions of thermally induced vibrations of the constituent [[atom]]s and molecules of the solid lattice and the incident light wave radiation. Hence, all materials are bounded by limiting regions of absorption caused by atomic and molecular vibrations (bond-stretching)in the far-infrared (>10&nbsp;\u00b5m).\n\nThus, multi-phonon absorption occurs when two or more phonons simultaneously interact to produce electric dipole moments with which the incident radiation may couple. These dipoles can absorb energy from the incident radiation, reaching a maximum coupling with the radiation when the frequency is equal to the fundamental vibrational mode of the molecular dipole (e.g. Si-O bond) in the far-infrared, or one of its harmonics.\n\nThe selective absorption of infrared (IR) light by a particular material occurs because the selected frequency of the light wave matches the frequency (or an integer multiple of the frequency) at which the particles of that material vibrate. Since different atoms and molecules have different natural frequencies of vibration, they will selectively absorb different frequencies (or portions of the spectrum) of infrared (IR) light.\n\nReflection and transmission of light waves occur because the frequencies of the light waves do not match the natural resonant frequencies of vibration of the objects. When IR light of these frequencies strikes an object, the energy is either reflected or transmitted.\n\n==Manufacturing==\n\n===Materials===\nGlass optical fibers are almost always made from [[silica]], but some other materials, such as [[fluoride glass|fluorozirconate]], [[fluoride glass|fluoroaluminate]], and [[chalcogenide glass]]es as well as crystalline materials like [[sapphire]], are used for longer-wavelength infrared or other specialized applications. Silica and fluoride glasses usually have refractive indices of about 1.5, but some materials such as the [[chalcogenide]]s can have indices as high as 3. Typically the index difference between core and cladding is less than one percent.\n\n[[Plastic optical fiber]]s (POF) are commonly step-index multi-mode fibers with a core diameter of 0.5 millimeters or larger. POF typically have higher attenuation coefficients than glass fibers, 1&nbsp;dB/m or higher, and this high attenuation limits the range of POF-based systems.\n\n====Silica====\n[[Silica]] exhibits fairly good optical transmission over a wide range of wavelengths. In the [[near-infrared]] (near IR) portion of the spectrum, particularly around 1.5 \u03bcm, silica can have extremely low absorption and scattering losses of the order of 0.2&nbsp;dB/km. Such remarkably low losses are possible only because ultra-pure silicon is available, it being essential for manufacturing integrated circuits and discrete transistors. A high transparency in the 1.4-\u03bcm region is achieved by maintaining a low concentration of [[hydroxyl group]]s (OH). Alternatively, a high OH [[concentration]] is better for transmission in the [[ultraviolet]] (UV) region.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Skuja | first1 = L. | last2 = Hirano | first2 = M. | last3 = Hosono | first3 = H. | last4 = Kajihara | first4 = K. | title = Defects in oxide glasses | doi = 10.1002/pssc.200460102 | journal = Physica status solidi (c) | volume = 2 | pages = 15\u201324 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref>\n\nSilica can be drawn into fibers at reasonably high temperatures, and has a fairly broad [[glass transformation range]]. One other advantage is that fusion splicing and cleaving of silica fibers is relatively effective. Silica fiber also has high mechanical strength against both pulling and even bending, provided that the fiber is not too thick and that the surfaces have been well prepared during processing. Even simple cleaving (breaking) of the ends of the fiber can provide nicely flat surfaces with acceptable optical quality. Silica is also relatively [[chemically inert]]. In particular, it is not [[Hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] (does not absorb water).\n\nSilica glass can be doped with various materials. One purpose of doping is to raise the [[refractive index]] (e.g. with [[germanium dioxide]] (GeO<sub>2</sub>) or [[aluminium oxide]] (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)) or to lower it (e.g. with [[fluorine]] or [[boron trioxide]] (B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)). Doping is also possible with laser-active ions (for example, [[rare earth element|rare earth]]-doped fibers) in order to obtain active fibers to be used, for example, in fiber amplifiers or [[laser]] applications. Both the fiber core and cladding are typically doped, so that the entire assembly (core and cladding) is effectively the same compound (e.g. an [[aluminosilicate]], germanosilicate, phosphosilicate or [[borosilicate glass]]).\n\nParticularly for active fibers, pure silica is usually not a very suitable host glass, because it exhibits a low solubility for rare earth ions. This can lead to quenching effects due to clustering of dopant ions. Aluminosilicates are much more effective in this respect.\n\nSilica fiber also exhibits a high threshold for optical damage. This property ensures a low tendency for laser-induced breakdown. This is important for fiber amplifiers when utilized for the amplification of short pulses.\n\nBecause of these properties silica fibers are the material of choice in many optical applications, such as communications (except for very short distances with plastic optical fiber), fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers, and fiber-optic sensors.

Because of their low [[viscosity]], it is very difficult to completely avoid [[crystallization]] while processing it through the glass transition (or drawing the fiber from the melt). Thus, although [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] fluoride glasses (HMFG) exhibit very low optical attenuation, they are not only difficult to manufacture, but are quite fragile, and have poor resistance to moisture and other environmental attacks. Their best attribute is that they lack the absorption band associated with the [[hydroxyl]] (OH) group (3,200\u20133,600&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>; i.e., 2,777\u20133,125&nbsp;nm or 2.78\u20133.13 \u03bcm), which is present in nearly all oxide-based glasses.\n\nAn example of a heavy metal fluoride glass is the [[ZBLAN]] glass group, composed of [[zirconium]], [[barium]], [[lanthanum]], [[aluminium]], and [[sodium]] fluorides. Their main technological application is as [[optical waveguide]]s in both planar and fiber form. They are advantageous especially in the [[mid-infrared]] (2,000\u20135,000&nbsp;nm) range.\n\nHMFGs were initially slated for optical fiber applications, because the intrinsic losses of a mid-IR fiber could in principle be lower than those of silica fibers, which are transparent only up to about 2 \u03bcm. However, such low losses were never realized in practice, and the fragility and high cost of fluoride fibers made them less than ideal as primary candidates. Later, the utility of fluoride fibers for various other applications was discovered. These include mid-[[IR spectroscopy]], [[fiber optic sensor]]s, [[thermometry]], and [[optical imaging|imaging]]. Also, fluoride fibers can be used for guided lightwave transmission in media such as YAG ([[yttrium aluminium garnet]]) [[laser]]s at 2.9 \u03bcm, as required for medical applications (e.g. [[ophthalmology]] and [[dentistry]]).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/JLT.1984.1073661|author=Tran, D.|title=Heavy metal fluoride glasses and fibers: A review|journal=J.

The preform is commonly made by three [[chemical vapor deposition]] methods: ''inside vapor deposition'', ''outside vapor deposition'', and ''vapor axial deposition''.<ref name=gowar1993>{{cite book|title=Optical communication systems\n|last= Gowar\n|first= John\n|edition= 2d\n|publisher= Prentice-Hall\n|location= Hempstead, UK\n|year= 1993\n|isbn= 0-13-638727-6\n|page= 209}}</ref>\n\nWith ''inside vapor deposition'', the preform starts as a hollow glass tube approximately {{convert|40|cm|in|sp=us}} long, which is placed horizontally and rotated slowly on a [[lathe]]. Gases such as [[silicon tetrachloride]] (SiCl<sub>4</sub>) or [[germanium tetrachloride]] (GeCl<sub>4</sub>) are injected with [[oxygen]] in the end of the tube. The gases are then heated by means of an external hydrogen burner, bringing the temperature of the gas up to 1,900&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] (1,600&nbsp;\u00b0C, 3,000&nbsp;\u00b0F), where the tetrachlorides react with oxygen to produce [[silica]] or [[germanium dioxide|germania]] (germanium dioxide) particles. When the reaction conditions are chosen to allow this reaction to occur in the gas phase throughout the tube volume, in contrast to earlier techniques where the reaction occurred only on the glass surface, this technique is called ''[[modified chemical vapor deposition]] (MCVD)''.\n\nThe oxide particles then agglomerate to form large particle chains, which subsequently deposit on the walls of the tube as soot. The deposition is due to the large difference in temperature between the gas core and the wall causing the gas to push the particles outwards (this is known as [[thermophoresis]]). The torch is then traversed up and down the length of the tube to deposit the material evenly. After the torch has reached the end of the tube, it is then brought back to the beginning of the tube and the deposited particles are then melted to form a solid layer. This process is repeated until a sufficient amount of material has been deposited. For each layer the composition can be modified by varying the gas composition, resulting in precise control of the finished fiber's optical properties.\n\nIn outside vapor deposition or vapor axial deposition, the glass is formed by ''flame hydrolysis'', a reaction in which silicon tetrachloride and germanium tetrachloride are oxidized by reaction with water (H<sub>2</sub>O) in an [[oxyhydrogen]] flame. In outside vapor deposition the glass is deposited onto a solid rod, which is removed before further processing. In vapor axial deposition, a short ''seed rod'' is used, and a porous preform, whose length is not limited by the size of the source rod, is built up on its end. The porous preform is consolidated into a transparent, solid preform by heating to about 1,800&nbsp;K (1,500&nbsp;\u00b0C, 2,800&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\n[[File:DShaped1.png|right|120px|right|thumb|Cross-section of a fiber drawn from a D-shaped '''preform''']]\nTypical communications fiber uses a circular preform. For some applications such as [[double-clad fiber]]s another form is preferred.<ref name=\"Kouznetsov\">{{cite journal|title=Highly efficient, high-gain, short-length, and power-scalable incoherent diode slab-pumped fiber amplifier/laser| author= Kouznetsov, D.|author2=Moloney, J.V.| journal=[[IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics]]| volume=39 | year=2003 | issue=11 | pages=1452\u20131461 | doi=10.1109/JQE.2003.818311|bibcode = 2003IJQE...39.1452K }}</ref> In [[fiber laser]]s based on double-clad fiber, an asymmetric shape improves the [[filling factor]] for [[laser pumping]].\n\nBecause of the surface tension, the shape is smoothed during the drawing process, and the shape of the resulting fiber does not reproduce the sharp edges of the preform. Nevertheless, careful polishing of the preform is important, since any defects of the preform surface affect the optical and mechanical properties of the resulting fiber. In particular, the preform for the test-fiber shown in the figure was not polished well, and cracks are seen with the confocal [[optical microscope]].\n\n====Drawing====\nThe preform, however constructed, is placed in a device known as a [[drawing tower]], where the preform tip is heated and the optical fiber is pulled out as a string. By measuring the resultant fiber width, the tension on the fiber can be controlled to maintain the fiber thickness.\n\n===Coatings===\nThe light is guided down the core of the fiber by an optical cladding with a lower refractive index that traps light in the core through total internal reflection.\n\nThe cladding is coated by a buffer that protects it from moisture and physical damage.<ref name=Kurkjian/> The buffer coating is what gets stripped off the fiber for termination or splicing. These coatings are UV-cured urethane acrylate composite or polyimide materials applied to the outside of the fiber during the drawing process. The coatings protect the very delicate strands of glass fiber\u2014about the size of a human hair\u2014and allow it to survive the rigors of manufacturing, proof testing, cabling and installation.\n\nToday\u2019s glass optical fiber draw processes employ a dual-layer coating approach. An inner primary coating is designed to act as a shock absorber to minimize attenuation caused by microbending. An outer secondary coating protects the primary coating against mechanical damage and acts as a barrier to lateral forces. Sometimes a metallic armor layer is added to provide extra protection.\n\nThese fiber optic coating layers are applied during the fiber draw, at speeds approaching {{convert|100|km/h|mph|-1|sp=us}}. Fiber optic coatings are applied using one of two methods: ''wet-on-dry'' and ''wet-on-wet''. In wet-on-dry, the fiber passes through a primary coating application, which is then UV cured\u2014then through the secondary coating application, which is subsequently cured. In wet-on-wet, the fiber passes through both the primary and secondary coating applications, then goes to UV curing.\n\nFiber optic coatings are applied in concentric layers to prevent damage to the fiber during the drawing application and to maximize fiber strength and microbend resistance. Unevenly coated fiber will experience non-uniform forces when the coating expands or contracts, and is susceptible to greater signal attenuation. Under proper drawing and coating processes, the coatings are concentric around the fiber, continuous over the length of the application and have constant thickness.\n\nFiber optic coatings protect the glass fibers from scratches that could lead to strength degradation. The combination of moisture and scratches accelerates the aging and deterioration of fiber strength. When fiber is subjected to low stresses over a long period, fiber fatigue can occur. Over time or in extreme conditions, these factors combine to cause microscopic flaws in the glass fiber to propagate, which can ultimately result in fiber failure.\n\nThree key characteristics of fiber optic waveguides can be affected by environmental conditions: strength, attenuation and resistance to losses caused by microbending. External fiber optic coatings protect glass optical fiber from environmental conditions that can affect the fiber\u2019s performance and long-term durability. On the inside, coatings ensure the reliability of the signal being carried and help minimize attenuation due to microbending.\n\n==Practical issues==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Cable construction===\n[[File:Optical fiber cable.jpg|thumb|An [[optical fiber cable]]]]\n{{Main article|Optical fiber cable}}\nIn practical fibers, the cladding is usually coated with a tough [[resin]] coating and an additional ''[[buffer (optical fiber)|buffer]]'' layer, which may be further surrounded by a ''jacket'' layer, usually plastic. These layers add strength to the fiber but do not contribute to its optical wave guide properties. Rigid fiber assemblies sometimes put light-absorbing (\"dark\") glass between the fibers, to prevent light that leaks out of one fiber from entering another. This reduces [[crosstalk (electronics)|cross-talk]] between the fibers, or reduces [[Lens flare|flare]] in fiber bundle imaging applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/ph/p/id/129#toc2 |title=Light collection and propagation |work=National Instruments' Developer Zone |publisher=National Instruments Corporation |accessdate=2007-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125051848/http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/ph/p/id/129 |archivedate=January 25, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=hecht2002>\n{{cite book| first=Jeff| last=Hecht| title=Understanding Fiber Optics| year=2002| edition=4th| isbn=0-13-027828-9|publisher= Prentice Hall}}</ref>\n\nModern cables come in a wide variety of sheathings and armor, designed for applications such as direct burial in trenches, high voltage isolation, dual use as power lines,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf |title=Screening report for Alaska rural energy plan |format=PDF |work=Alaska Division of Community and Regional Affairs|accessdate=April 11, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508191931/http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf|archivedate=May 8, 2006}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=November 2008}} installation in conduit, lashing to aerial telephone poles, submarine installation, and insertion in paved streets. Multi-fiber cable usually uses colored coatings and/or buffers to identify each strand. The cost of small fiber-count pole-mounted cables has greatly decreased due to the high demand for [[fiber to the home]] (FTTH) installations in Japan and South Korea.\n\nFiber cable can be very flexible, but traditional fiber's loss increases greatly if the fiber is bent with a radius smaller than around 30&nbsp;mm. This creates a problem when the cable is bent around corners or wound around a spool, making [[FTTX]] installations more complicated. \"Bendable fibers\", targeted towards easier installation in home environments, have been standardized as ITU-T G.657. This type of fiber can be bent with a radius as low as 7.5&nbsp;mm without adverse impact. Even more bendable fibers have been developed.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Corning announces breakthrough optical fiber technology |publisher=[[Corning Incorporated]] |date=2007-07-23 |url=http://www.corning.com/news_center/news_releases/2007/2007072301.aspx |accessdate=2013-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613040314/http://www.corning.com/news_center/news_releases/2007/2007072301.aspx |archivedate=June 13, 2011 }}</ref>\nBendable fiber may also be resistant to fiber hacking, in which the signal in a fiber is surreptitiously monitored by bending the fiber and detecting the leakage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/security/?p=222 |title=Protect your network against fiber hacks |accessdate=2007-12-10 |last=Olzak |first=Tom |date=2007-05-03 |work=Techrepublic |publisher=CNET |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217210636/http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/security/?p=222 |archivedate=2010-02-17}}</ref>\n\nAnother important feature of cable is cable's ability to withstand horizontally applied force. It is technically called max tensile strength defining how much force can be applied to the cable during the installation period.\n\nSome fiber optic cable versions are reinforced with [[aramid]] yarns or glass yarns as intermediary [[strength member]]. In commercial terms, usage of the glass yarns are more cost effective while no loss in mechanical durability of the cable. Glass yarns also protect the cable core against rodents and termites.\n\n===Termination and splicing===\n[[File:ST-optical-fiber-connector-hdr-0a.jpg|thumb|upright|[[optical fiber connector|ST connectors]] on [[multi-mode fiber]].]]\n\nOptical fibers are connected to terminal equipment by [[optical fiber connector]]s. These connectors are usually of a standard type such as ''FC'', ''SC'', ''ST'', ''LC'', ''MTRJ'', or ''SMA''. Optical fibers may be connected to each other by connectors or by ''splicing'', that is, joining two fibers together to form a continuous optical waveguide. The generally accepted splicing method is [[fusion splicing|arc fusion splicing]], which melts the fiber ends together with an [[electric arc]]. For quicker fastening jobs, a \u201cmechanical splice\u201d is used.\n\nFusion splicing is done with a specialized instrument. The fiber ends are first stripped of their protective polymer coating (as well as the more sturdy outer jacket, if present). The ends are ''cleaved'' (cut) with a precision cleaver to make them perpendicular, and are placed into special holders in the fusion splicer. The splice is usually inspected via a magnified viewing screen to check the cleaves before and after the splice. The splicer uses small motors to align the end faces together, and emits a small spark between [[electrodes]] at the gap to burn off dust and moisture. Then the splicer generates a larger spark that raises the temperature above the [[melting point]] of the glass, fusing the ends together permanently. The location and energy of the spark is carefully controlled so that the molten core and cladding do not mix, and this minimizes optical loss. A splice loss estimate is measured by the splicer, by directing light through the cladding on one side and measuring the light leaking from the cladding on the other side. A splice loss under 0.1&nbsp;dB is typical. The complexity of this process makes fiber splicing much more difficult than splicing copper wire.\n\nMechanical fiber splices are designed to be quicker and easier to install, but there is still the need for stripping, careful cleaning and precision cleaving. The fiber ends are aligned and held together by a precision-made sleeve, often using a clear [[index-matching gel]] that enhances the transmission of light across the joint. Such joints typically have higher optical loss and are less robust than fusion splices, especially if the gel is used. All splicing techniques involve installing an enclosure that protects the splice.\n\nFibers are terminated in connectors that hold the fiber end precisely and securely. A fiber-optic connector is basically a rigid cylindrical barrel surrounded by a sleeve that holds the barrel in its mating socket. The mating mechanism can be ''push and click'', ''turn and latch'' (''[[bayonet mount]]''), or ''screw-in'' (''threaded''). The barrel is typically free to move within the sleeve, and may have a key that prevents the barrel and fiber from rotating as the connectors are mated.\n\nA typical connector is installed by preparing the fiber end and inserting it into the rear of the connector body. Quick-set adhesive is usually used to hold the fiber securely, and a [[strain relief]] is secured to the rear. Once the adhesive sets, the fiber's end is polished to a mirror finish. Various polish profiles are used, depending on the type of fiber and the application. For single-mode fiber, fiber ends are typically polished with a slight curvature that makes the mated connectors touch only at their cores. This is called a ''physical contact'' (PC) polish. The curved surface may be polished at an angle, to make an ''angled physical contact (APC)'' connection. Such connections have higher loss than PC connections, but greatly reduced back reflection, because light that reflects from the angled surface leaks out of the fiber core. The resulting signal strength loss is called ''[[gap loss]]''. APC fiber ends have low back reflection even when disconnected.\n\nIn the 1990s, terminating fiber optic cables was labor-intensive. The number of parts per connector, polishing of the fibers, and the need to oven-bake the epoxy in each connector made terminating fiber optic cables difficult. Today, many connectors types are on the market that offer easier, less labor-intensive ways of terminating cables. Some of the most popular connectors are pre-polished at the factory, and include a gel inside the connector. Those two steps help save money on labor, especially on large projects. A [[cleave (fiber)|cleave]] is made at a required length, to get as close to the polished piece already inside the connector. The gel surrounds the point where the two pieces meet inside the connector for very little light loss.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n===Free-space coupling===\nIt is often necessary to align an optical fiber with another optical fiber, or with an [[optoelectronic device]] such as a [[light-emitting diode]], a [[laser diode]], or a [[modulator]]. This can involve either carefully aligning the fiber and placing it in contact with the device, or can use a [[lens (optics)|lens]] to allow coupling over an air gap. Typically the size of the fiber mode is much larger than the size of the mode in a laser diode or a [[Silicon photonics|silicon optical chip]]. In this case a tapered or [[lensed fiber]] is used to match the fiber mode field distribution to that of the other element. The lens on the end of the fiber can be formed using polishing, laser cutting<ref>{{cite web|title=Laser Lensing |work=OpTek Systems Inc.|url=http://www.opteksystems.com/laser-lens}}</ref> or fusion splicing.\n\nIn a laboratory environment, a bare fiber end is coupled using a fiber launch system, which uses a [[microscope objective lens]] to focus the light down to a fine point. A precision [[translation stage]] (micro-positioning table) is used to move the lens, fiber, or device to allow the coupling efficiency to be optimized. Fibers with a connector on the end make this process much simpler: the connector is simply plugged into a pre-aligned fiberoptic collimator, which contains a lens that is either accurately positioned with respect to the fiber, or is adjustable. To achieve the best injection efficiency into single-mode fiber, the direction, position, size and divergence of the beam must all be optimized. With good beams, 70 to 90% coupling efficiency can be achieved.\n\nWith properly polished single-mode fibers, the emitted beam has an almost perfect Gaussian shape\u2014even in the far field\u2014if a good lens is used. The lens needs to be large enough to support the full numerical aperture of the fiber, and must not introduce [[optical aberration|aberrations]] in the beam. [[Aspheric lens]]es are typically used.\n\n===Fiber fuse===\nAt high optical intensities, above 2 [[megawatt]]s per square centimeter, when a fiber is subjected to a shock or is otherwise suddenly damaged, a ''fiber fuse'' can occur. The reflection from the damage vaporizes the fiber immediately before the break, and this new defect remains reflective so that the damage propagates back toward the transmitter at 1\u20133 meters per second (4\u201311&nbsp;km/h, 2\u20138&nbsp;mph).<ref>{{cite journal |first=R.

Modulation of the light source to transmit a signal also slightly widens the frequency band of the transmitted light. This has the effect that, over long distances and at high modulation speeds, the different frequencies of light can take different times to arrive at the receiver, ultimately making the signal impossible to discern, and requiring extra repeaters.<ref>G.

Agrawal, Fiber Optic Communication Systems, Wiley-Interscience, 1997.</ref> This problem can be overcome in a number of ways, including the use of a relatively short length of fiber that has the opposite refractive index gradient.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{div col||20em}}\n* [[Borescope]]\n* [[Cable jetting]]\n* [[Data cable]]\n* [[Distributed acoustic sensing]]\n* [[Endoscopy]]\n* [[Fiber amplifier]]\n* [[Fiber Bragg grating]]\n* [[Fiber laser]]\n* [[Fiber pigtail]]\n* [[Fiberscope]]\n* [[Fibre Channel]]\n* [[Gradient-index optics]]\n* [[Interconnect bottleneck]]\n* [[Leaky mode]]\n* [[Li-Fi]]\n* [[Light Peak]]\n* [[Modal bandwidth]]\n* [[Optical amplifier]]\n* [[Optical communication]]\n* [[Optical fiber cable]]\n* [[Optical fiber connector]]\n* [[Optical interconnect]]\n* [[Optical mesh network]]\n* [[Optical power meter]]\n* [[Optical time-domain reflectometer]]\n* [[Optoelectronics]]\n* [[Parallel optical interface]]\n* [[Photonic-crystal fiber]]\n* [[Return loss]]\n* [[Small form-factor pluggable transceiver]]\n* [[Soliton]], [[Vector soliton]]\n* [[Submarine communications cable]]s\n* [[Subwavelength-diameter optical fibre]]\n* [[Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA)]]\n* [[XENPAK]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|first=Govind|last=Agrawal|title=Fiber-Optic Communication Systems|publisher=Wiley|year=2010|isbn=9780470505113|doi=10.1002/9780470918524|edition=4}}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Gambling | first1 = W.
