For objects traveling in dry air of a temperature of 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F) at [[sea level]], this speed is approximately 343&nbsp;[[meter per second|m/s]], 1,125 [[feet per second|ft/s]], 768&nbsp;[[Miles per hour|mph]], 667&nbsp;[[Knot (unit)|knots]], or 1,235&nbsp;[[kilometre per hour|km/h]]. Speeds greater than five times the speed of sound (Mach&nbsp;5) are often referred to as [[hypersonic]]. Flights during which only some parts of the air surrounding an object, such as the ends of rotor blades, reach supersonic speeds are called [[transonic]]. This occurs typically somewhere between Mach&nbsp;0.8 and Mach&nbsp;1.23.\n\nSounds are traveling vibrations in the form of pressure waves in an elastic medium. In gases, sound travels longitudinally at different speeds, mostly depending on the [[molecular mass]] and [[temperature]] of the gas, and [[pressure]] has little effect. Since air temperature and composition varies significantly with altitude, [[Mach number]]s for aircraft may change despite a constant travel speed. In water at [[room temperature]] supersonic speed can be considered as any speed greater than 1,440&nbsp;m/s (4,724&nbsp;ft/s). In solids, sound waves can be polarized longitudinally or transversely and have even higher velocities.\n\n[[Supersonic fracture]] is crack motion faster than the speed of sound in a [[brittle]] material.\n\n==Early meaning==\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the term \"supersonic\" was used as an adjective to describe sound whose frequency is above the range of normal human hearing.  The modern term for this meaning is \"[[ultrasound|ultrasonic]]\".\n\n==Supersonic objects==\n{{main|Supersonic aircraft}}\nThe tip of a [[bullwhip]] is thought to be the first man-made object to break the sound barrier, resulting in the telltale \"crack\" (actually a small [[sonic boom]]). The [[wave motion]] traveling through the bullwhip is what makes it capable of achieving supersonic speeds.<ref>[http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2002/9/crackin-good-mathematics Mike May, ''Crackin' Good Mathematics'', American Scientist, Volume 90, Number 5, 2002]</ref><ref>[http://www.hypography.com/article.cfm?id=32479 Hypography - Science for everyone - Whip Cracking Mystery Explained<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nMost modern [[fighter aircraft]] are supersonic aircraft, but there have been [[supersonic transport|supersonic passenger aircraft]], namely [[Concorde]] and the [[Tupolev Tu-144]]. Both these passenger [[aircraft]] and some modern fighters are also capable of [[supercruise]], a condition of sustained supersonic flight without the use of an [[afterburner]]. Due to its ability to supercruise for several hours and the relatively high frequency of flight over several decades, Concorde spent more time flying supersonically than all other aircraft combined by a considerable margin. Since Concorde's final retirement flight on November 26, 2003, there are no supersonic passenger aircraft left in service. Some large [[bombers]], such as the [[Tupolev Tu-160]] and [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer]] are also supersonic-capable.\n\nMost modern [[firearm]] [[bullets]] are supersonic, with rifle [[projectiles]] often travelling at speeds approaching and in some cases<ref name=\"hornady\">[http://www.hornady.com/images/ballistics/ballistics_charts.pdf Hornady Ammunition Charts]</ref> well exceeding [[Mach (speed)|Mach]] 3.\n\nMost [[spacecraft]], most notably the [[Space Shuttle]] are supersonic at least during portions of their reentry, though the effects on the spacecraft are reduced by low air densities. During ascent, launch vehicles generally avoid going supersonic below 30&nbsp;km (~98,400&nbsp;feet) to reduce air drag.\n\nNote that the [[Speed of sound#Speed in ideal gases and in air|speed of sound]] decreases somewhat with altitude, due to lower temperatures found there (typically up to 25&nbsp;km). At even higher altitudes the temperature starts increasing, with the corresponding increase in the speed of sound.<ref>[http://bpesoft.com/s/wleizero/xhac/?M=s eXtreme High Altitude Conditions Calculator]</ref>\n\n==Supersonic flight==\nSupersonic [[aerodynamics]] is simpler than subsonic aerodynamics because the airsheets at different points along the plane often can't affect each other. Supersonic jets and rocket vehicles require several times greater thrust to push through the extra [[aerodynamic drag]] experienced within the [[transonic]] region (around Mach 0.85\u20131.2). At these speeds [[aerospace engineer]]s can gently guide air around the [[fuselage]] of the aircraft without producing new [[shock wave]]s but any change in cross area farther down the vehicle leads to shock waves along the body. Designers use the [[Supersonic area rule]] and the [[Whitcomb area rule]] to minimize sudden changes in size.\n[[File:Dopplereffectsourcemovingrightatmach1.4.gif|thumb|The sound source has now broken through the sound speed barrier, and is traveling at 1.4 times the speed of sound, c (Mach 1.4). Because the source is moving faster than the sound waves it creates, it actually leads the advancing wavefront. The sound source will pass by a stationary observer before the observer actually hears the sound it creates.]]\nHowever, in practical applications, a supersonic aircraft will have to operate stably in both subsonic and supersonic profiles, hence aerodynamic design is more complex.\n\nOne problem with sustained supersonic flight is the generation of heat in flight.  At high speeds [[aerodynamic heating]] can occur, so an aircraft must be designed to operate and function under very high temperatures. [[Duralumin]], the traditional aircraft material, starts to lose strength and go into plastic deformation at relatively low temperatures, and is unsuitable for continuous use at speeds above Mach 2.2 to&nbsp;2.4. Materials such as [[titanium]] and [[stainless steel]] allow operations at much higher temperatures. For example, the [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird]] jet could fly continuously at Mach&nbsp;3.1 while some parts were above 315&nbsp;\u00b0C (600&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nAnother area of concern for continued high-speed operation is the engines. Jet engines create thrust by increasing the temperature of the air they ingest, and as the aircraft speeds up, [[aerodynamic heating|friction and compression heats this air]] before it reaches the engines. The maximum allowable temperature of the exhaust is determined by the materials in the [[turbine]] at the rear of the engine, so as the aircraft speeds up, the difference in intake and exhaust temperature that the engine can create decreases, and the thrust along with it. [[Air cooling]] the turbine area to allow operations at higher temperatures was a key solution, one that continued to improve through the 1950s and on to this day.\n\nIntake design was also a major issue. Normal jet engines can only ingest subsonic air, so for supersonic operation the air has to be slowed down. Ramps or cones in the intake are used to create [[shock wave]]s that slows the airflow before it reaches the engine. Doing so removes energy from the airflow, causing drag. The key to reducing this drag is to use multiple small oblique shock waves, but this was difficult because the angle they make inside the intake changes with Mach number. In order to efficiently operate across a range of speeds, the shock waves have to be \"tuned.\"\n\nAn aircraft able to [[Supercruise|operate for extended periods at supersonic speeds]] has a potential range advantage over a similar design operating subsonically. Most of the drag an aircraft sees while speeding up to supersonic speeds occurs just below the speed of sound, due to an aerodynamic effect known as [[wave drag]]. An aircraft that can accelerate past this speed sees a significant drag decrease, and can fly supersonically with improved fuel economy. However, due to the way lift is generated supersonically, the [[lift-to-drag ratio]] of the aircraft as a whole drops, leading to lower range, offsetting or overturning this advantage.\n\nThe key to having low supersonic drag is to properly shape the overall aircraft to be long and thin, and close to a \"perfect\" shape, the [[Nose cone design#Haack series|von Karman ogive]] or [[Sears-Haack body]]. This has led to almost every supersonic cruising aircraft looking very similar to every other, with a very long and slender fuselage and large delta wings, cf. [[SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71]], [[Concorde]], etc. Although not ideal for passenger aircraft, this shaping is quite adaptable for bomber use.\n\n===History of supersonic flight===\n{{Main|Sound barrier}}\nAviation research during World War II led to the creation of the first rocket- and jet-powered aircraft. Several claims of breaking the sound barrier during the war subsequently emerged. However, the first recognized flight exceeding the speed of sound by a manned aircraft in controlled level flight was performed on October&nbsp;14, 1947 by the experimental [[Bell&nbsp;X-1]] research rocket plane piloted by [[Chuck Yeager|Charles \"Chuck\" Yeager]]. The first production plane to break the sound barrier was an F-86 [[Canadair Sabre]] with the first 'supersonic' woman pilot, [[Jacqueline Cochran]], at the controls, although this aircraft was not designed with regular supersonic flights in mind.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} According to David Masters in 'German Jet Genesis', Jane's, 1982; ISBN 0 7106 0186 7, the DFS 346 prototype captured in Germany by the Soviets, after being released from a B-29 at 32800&nbsp;ft (10000 m), reached 683&nbsp;mph (1100 kph) late in 1945, which would have exceeded Mach 1 at that height. The pilot in these flights was the German Wolfgang Ziese.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Area rule]]\n* [[Hypersonic speed]]\n* [[Transonic|Transonic speed]]\n* [[Sonic boom]]\n* [[Supersonic aircraft]]\n* [[Supersonic airfoils]]\n* [[Vapor cone]]\n* [[Prandtl\u2013Glauert singularity]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=PyEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA72&dq=motor+gun+boat&hl=en&ei=LxTqTMfGI4-bnwfEyNiWDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=motor%20gun%20boat&f=true \"Can We Ever Fly Faster Speed of Sound\", October 1944, Popular Science] one of the earliest articles on shock waves and flying the speed of sound\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=NSEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA114&dq=popular+science+January+1946&hl=en&ei=vb7kTIbiC4uQnwfUwpT4BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&sqi=2&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=popular%20science%20January%201946&f=true \"Britain Goes Supersonic\", January 1946, Popular Science] 1946 article trying to explain supersonic flight to the general public\n* [http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath109/kmath109.htm MathPages - The Speed of Sound]\n* [http://www.makeitlouder.com/Decibel%20Level%20Chart.txt Supersonic sound pressure levels]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Aerodynamics]]\n[[Category:Aerospace engineering]]\n[[Category:Airspeed]]\n[[Category:Sound]]"}]}}}}
