Perhaps, the best known parallel manipulator is formed from six linear actuators that support a movable base for devices such as flight simulators.  This device is called a [[Stewart platform]] or the Gough-Stewart platform in recognition of the engineers who first designed and used them.<ref>{{Cite book\n  |last=Merlet  |first=J.P.\n  |title=Parallel Robots, 2nd Edition\n  |year=2008\n  |publisher=Springer\n  |isbn= 978-1-4020-4132-7\n}}</ref>\n\nAlso known as '''parallel robots''', or '''generalized Stewart platforms''' (in the [[Stewart platform]], the actuators are paired together on both the basis and the platform), these systems are [[articulated robot]]s that use similar mechanisms for the movement of either the robot on its base, or one or more [[manipulator (device)|manipulator]] arms. Their 'parallel' distinction, as opposed to a [[serial manipulator]], is that the  [[end effector]] (or 'hand') of this linkage (or 'arm') is connected to its base by a number of (usually three or six) separate and independent linkages working in parallel. 'Parallel' is used here in the [[computer science]] sense, rather than the [[geometrical]]; these linkages act together, but it is not implied that they are aligned as parallel lines; here ''parallel'' means that the position of the end point of each linkage is independent of the position of the other linkages.\n\n==Design features==\nA parallel manipulator is designed so that each chain is usually short, simple and can thus be rigid against unwanted movement, compared to a serial manipulator. Errors in one chain's positioning are averaged in conjunction with the others, rather than being cumulative. Each actuator must still move within its own [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degree of freedom]], as for a serial robot; however in the parallel robot the off-axis flexibility of a joint is also constrained by the effect of the other chains.  It is this [[Control theory#Closed-loop transfer function|closed-loop]] stiffness that makes the overall parallel manipulator stiff relative to its components, unlike the serial chain that becomes progressively less rigid with more components.\n\nThis mutual stiffening also permits simple construction: [[Stewart platform]] hexapods chains use [[prismatic joint]] [[linear actuator]]s between any-axis universal [[ball joint]]s. The ball joints are passive: simply free to move, without actuators or brakes; their position is constrained solely by the other chains. [[Delta robot]]s have base-mounted [[rotary actuator]]s that move a light, stiff, parallelogram arm. The effector is mounted between the tips of three of these arms and again, it may be mounted with simple ball-joints. [[Statics|Static]] representation of a parallel robot is often akin to that of a [[pin-jointed truss]]: the links and their actuators feel only tension or compression, without any bending or torque, which again reduces the effects of any flexibility to off-axis forces.\n\nA further advantage of the parallel manipulator is that the heavy actuators may often be centrally mounted on a single base platform, the movement of the arm taking place through struts and joints alone. This reduction in mass along the arm permits a lighter arm construction, thus lighter actuators and faster movements. This centralisation of mass also reduces the robot's overall [[moment of inertia]], which may be an advantage for a mobile or [[walking robot]].\n\nAll these features result in manipulators with a wide range of motion capability. As their speed of action is often constrained by their rigidity rather than sheer power, they can be fast-acting, in comparison to serial manipulators.\n\n== Comparison to serial manipulators ==\n[[File:Hexapod positioner aka Stewart platform x2.jpg|thumb|Hexapod positioning systems, also known as Stewart Platforms.]]\n\nMost robot applications require rigidity. Serial robots may achieve this by using high-quality rotary joints that permit movement in one axis but are rigid against movement outside this. Any joint permitting movement ''must'' also have this movement under deliberate control by an actuator. A movement requiring several axes thus requires a number of such joints. Unwanted flexibility or sloppiness in one joint causes a similar sloppiness in the arm, which may be amplified by the distance between the joint and the end-effectuor: there is no opportunity to brace one joint's movement against another. Their inevitable [[hysteresis]] and off-axis flexibility accumulates along the arm's [[kinematic chain]]; a precision serial manipulator is a compromise between precision, complexity, mass (of the manipulator and of the manipulated objects) and cost. On the other hand, with parallel manipulators, a high rigidity may be obtained with a small mass of the manipulator (relatively to the charge being manipulated). This allows high precision and high speed of movements, and motivates the use of parallel manipulators in [[flight simulator]]s (high speed with rather large masses) and [[electrostatic lens|electrostatic]] or [[magnetic lens]]es in [[particle accelerator]]s (very high precision in positioning large masses). \n\n[[File:DexTAR.jpg|thumb|A five-bar [[parallel robot]]<ref>{{cite web\n  |title=DexTAR - an educational parallel robot\n  |url=http://www.mecademic.com/DexTAR.html\n}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Sketchy, portrait-drawing delta robot.jpg|thumb|upright|''Sketchy'', a portrait-drawing [[delta robot]]<ref>{{cite web\n  |title=Sketchy, a home-constructed drawing robot\n  |url=http://www.jarkman.co.uk/catalog/robots/sketchy.htm\n  |publisher=Jarkman\n}}</ref>]]\n\nA drawback of parallel manipulators, in comparison to serial manipulators, is their limited workspace. As for serial manipulators, the workspace is limited by the geometrical and mechanical limits of the design (collisions between legs maximal and minimal lengths of the legs). The workspace is also limited by the existence of ''singularities'', which are positions where, for some trajectories of the movement, the variation of the lengths of the legs is infinitely smaller than the variation of the position. Conversely, at a singular position, a force (like gravity) applied on the end-effector induce infinitely large constraints on the legs, which may result in a kind of \"explosion\" of the manipulator. The determination of the singular positions is difficult (for a general parallel manipulator, this is an open problem). This implies that the workspaces of the parallel manipulators are, usually, artificially limited to a small region where one knows that there is no singularity.\n\nAnother drawback of parallel manipulators is their [[nonlinear]] behavior: the command which is needed for getting a linear or a circular movement of the end-effector depends dramatically on the location in the workspace and does not vary linearly during the movement. Because of the difficulty of such a non-linear command, the parallel manipulators are not yet used in high precision [[machining]], despite their excellent mechanical properties (speed and precision).\n\n==Applications==\nMajor industrial applications of these devices are:\n* [[flight simulator]]s\n* automobile simulators\n* in work processes\n* [[photonics]] / [[optical fiber]] alignment<ref>http://www.pb.izm.fhg.de/p2sa/020_Technologies/Optik/FundE_Faserjustage.html</ref>\nThey also become more popular:\n* in high speed, high-accuracy positioning with limited workspace, such as in assembly of [[Printed circuit board|PCBs]]\n* as micro manipulators mounted on the end effector of larger but slower [[serial manipulator]]s\n* as high speed/high-precision [[milling machine]]s\n\nParallel robots are usually more limited in the workspace; for instance, they generally cannot reach around obstacles.  The calculations involved in performing a desired manipulation (forward kinematics) are also usually more difficult and can lead to multiple solutions.\n\nTwo examples of popular parallel robots are the [[Stewart platform]] and the [[Delta robot]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Robot kinematics]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book\n  |last=Gogu  |first=Grigore\n  |title=Structural Synthesis of Parallel Robots, Part 1: Methodology\n  |year=2008\n  |publisher=Springer\n  |isbn= 978-1-4020-5102-9\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n  |last=Gogu |first=Grigore\n  |title=Structural Synthesis of Parallel Robots, Part 2: Translational topologies with Two and Three Degrees of Freedom\n  |year=2009\n  |publisher=Springer\n  |isbn= 978-1-4020-9793-5\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n  |last=Merlet  |first=J.P.\n  |title=Parallel Robots, 2nd Edition\n  |year=2008\n  |publisher=Springer\n  |isbn= 978-1-4020-4132-7\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n  |last=Kong  |first=X.\n  |last2=Gosselin  |first2=C.\n  |title=Type Synthesis of Parallel Mechanisms\n  |year=2007\n  |publisher=Springer\n  |isbn= 978-3-540-71989-2\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Parallel robots}}\n*[http://www.parallemic.org Parallel Mechanisms Information Center]\n*[http://www.mecademic.com/What-is-a-parallel-robot.html What is a parallel robot?]\n\n[[Category:Parallel robots]]\n[[Category:Articulated robotics]]"}]}}}}
