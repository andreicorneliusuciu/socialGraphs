Arduino is not some hardware you should be afraid of. Arduino comes in a variety of flavors and sizes. It is used by artists, hackers, hobbyists, and professionals to easily design, prototype and experiment with electronics. Use it as brains for your robot, to build a new digital music instrument, or to make your house plant tweet you when it's dry. An Arduino contains a microchip, which is a very small computer that you can program. You can attach sensors to it so that it can measure conditions (like how much light there is in the room). It can control how other objects react to those conditions (room gets dark. LED turns on).\n\nThe project is based on [[microcontroller]] board designs, produced by several vendors, using various microcontrollers. Microcontrollers use inputs and outputs like any computer. Inputs capture information from the user or the environment while outputs do something with the information that has been captured. A switch and a sensor could be a digital and an analog input respectively into the Arduino. Any object we want to turn on and off and control could be an output. It could be a motor or even a computer. These systems provide sets of digital and analog [[input/output]] (I/O) pins that can interface to various expansion boards (termed ''shields'') and other circuits. The boards feature serial communication interfaces, including Universal Serial Bus ([[USB]]) on some models, for loading programs from personal computers. For programming the microcontrollers, the Arduino project provides an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) based on a programming language named ''[[Processing (programming language)|Processing]]'', which also supports the languages [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]]. The Arduino language is very similar to C. It's almost the same language but Arduino provides us with several libraries to make things a bit easier.\n\nThe first Arduino was introduced in 2005, based on 8-bit [[Atmel AVR]], aiming to provide a low cost, easy way for novices and professionals to create devices that interact with their environment using [[sensor]]s and [[actuator]]s. Common examples of such devices intended for beginner hobbyists include simple [[robot]]s, [[thermostat]]s, and motion detectors.\n\nArduino comes in a variety of different boards. Arduino boards are available commercially in pre-assembled form, or as [[do-it-yourself]] kits. The hardware design specifications are openly available, allowing the Arduino boards to be produced by anyone.  In mid-2011, it was estimated that over 300,000 official Arduinos had been commercially produced,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2011/05/15/how-many-arduinos-are-in-the-wild-about-300000/ |title=How many Arduinos are \"in the wild?\" About 300,000 |publisher=[[Adafruit Industries]] |date=May 15, 2011 |accessdate=2013-05-26}}</ref> and in 2013 that 700,000 official boards were in users' hands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://medea.mah.se/2013/04/arduino-faq// |title=Arduino FAQ \u2013 With David Cuartielles |publisher=[[Malm\u00f6 University]] |date=April 5, 2013 |accessdate=2014-03-24}}</ref>\n\n==Hardware==\n{{Update|section|inaccurate=yes|date=October 2015}}\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2013}}\n\n[[File:Arduino316.jpg|thumb|An early Arduino board<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arduino.cc/en/main/boards |title=Hardware Index |publisher=Arduino Project |accessdate=2013-12-10}}</ref> with an [[RS-232]] [[serial communication|serial]] interface (upper left) and an Atmel ATmega8 microcontroller chip (black, lower right); the 14 digital I/O pins are at the top, the 6 analog input pins at the lower right, and the power connector at the lower left.]]\n\nAn Arduino board consists of an [[Atmel]] 8-, 16- or 32-bit AVR [[microcontroller]] (although since 2015 other makers' microcontrollers have been used) with complementary components that facilitate programming and incorporation into other circuits. An important aspect of the Arduino is its standard connectors, which let users connect the CPU board to a variety of interchangeable add-on modules termed ''shields''. Some shields communicate with the Arduino board directly over various pins, but many shields are individually addressable via an [[I\u00b2C]] [[serial bus]]\u2014so many shields can be stacked and used in parallel. Before 2015, Official Arduinos had used the Atmel [[megaAVR]] series of chips, specifically the [[ATmega8]], [[ATmega168]], [[ATmega328]], [[ATmega1280]], and [[ATmega2560]]. In 2015, units by other producers were added. A handful of other processors have also been used by Arduino compatible devices. Most boards include a 5 V [[linear regulator]] and a 16&nbsp;MHz [[crystal oscillator]] (or [[ceramic resonator]] in some variants), although some designs such as the LilyPad run at 8&nbsp;MHz and dispense with the onboard voltage regulator due to specific form-factor restrictions. An Arduino's microcontroller is also pre-programmed with a [[boot loader]] that simplifies uploading of programs to the on-chip [[flash memory]], compared with other devices that typically need an external [[programmer (hardware)|chip programmer]]. This makes using an Arduino more straightforward by allowing the use of an ordinary computer as the programmer. Currently, optiboot bootloader is the default bootloader installed on Arduino UNO.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://github.com/Optiboot/optiboot|title=Optiboot Bootloader for Arduino and Atmel AVR| accessdate=2015-10-01}}</ref>\n\nAt a conceptual level, when using the Arduino integrated development environment, all boards are programmed over a serial connection. Its implementation varies with the hardware version. Some serial Arduino boards contain a level shifter circuit to convert between [[RS-232]] logic levels and [[transistor\u2013transistor logic]] (TTL) level signals. Current Arduino boards are programmed via [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB), implemented using USB-to-serial adapter chips such as the [[FTDI]] FT232. Some boards, such as later-model Uno boards, substitute the FTDI chip with a separate AVR chip containing USB-to-serial firmware, which is reprogrammable via its own ICSP header. Other variants, such as the Arduino Mini and the unofficial Boarduino, use a detachable USB-to-serial adapter board or cable, [[Bluetooth]] or other methods, when used with traditional microcontroller tools instead of the Arduino IDE, standard AVR [[in-system programming]] (ISP) programming is used.\n\n[[File:UnoConnections.jpg|thumb|An official Arduino Uno R2 with descriptions of the I/O locations]]\n\nThe Arduino board exposes most of the microcontroller's I/O pins for use by other circuits. The ''Diecimila'',{{Efn|name=\"N10000\"|''Diecimila'' means \"ten thousands\" in Italian}} ''Duemilanove'',{{Efn|name=\"N2009\"|''Duemilanove'' means \"two thousands nine\" in Italian}} and current ''Uno''{{Efn|name=\"N1\"|''Uno'' means \"one\" in Italian}} provide 14 digital I/O pins, six of which can produce [[pulse-width modulation|pulse-width modulated]] signals, and six analog inputs, which can also be used as six digital I/O pins. These pins are on the top of the board, via female 0.1-inch (2.54&nbsp;mm) headers. Several plug-in application shields are also commercially available. The Arduino Nano, and Arduino-compatible Bare Bones Board<ref>{{cite web |url=http://moderndevice.com/product/bare-bones-board-bbb-kit/ |title= Bare Bones Board}}</ref> and Boarduino<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.adafruit.com/products/72 |title= Boarduino}}</ref> boards may provide male header pins on the underside of the board that can plug into solderless [[breadboard]]s.\n\nMany Arduino-compatible and Arduino-derived boards exist. Some are functionally equivalent to an Arduino and can be used interchangeably. Many enhance the basic Arduino by adding output drivers, often for use in school-level education, to simplify making buggies and small robots. Others are electrically equivalent but change the form factor, sometimes retaining compatibility with shields, sometimes not. Some variants use different processors, of varying compatibility.\n\n=== Official boards ===\n{{further information|List of Arduino boards and compatible systems}}\nThe original Arduino hardware was produced by the Italian company Smart Projects.<ref name=\"smartprojects\"/> Some Arduino-branded boards have been designed by the American companies [[SparkFun Electronics]] and [[Adafruit Industries]].<ref>Schmidt, M.

Shields can provide motor controls for [[3D printing]] and other applications, [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), Ethernet, [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD), or breadboarding ([[Prototype|prototyping]]). Several shields can also be made [[do it yourself]] (DIY).<ref name=\"AutoF7-35\"/><ref name=\"AutoF7-36\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://shieldlist.org/ |title= Arduino Shield list |author=Jonathan Oxer |accessdate=5 Nov 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Examples====\n<gallery>\n<!-- This gallery does not list all shields.

It originated from the IDE for the languages ''[[Processing (programming language)|Processing]]'' and ''[[Wiring (development platform)|Wiring]]''. It was created for people with no profound knowledge of electronics. It includes a code editor with features such as [[syntax highlighting]], [[brace matching]], cutting/pasting text, searching/replacing text and automatic indentation, and provides simple one-click mechanism to compile and upload programs to an Arduino board. It also contains a message area, a text console, a toolbar with buttons for common functions and a series of menus. \n\nA program written with the IDE for Arduino is called a \"sketch\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Arduino-Getting-Started-Sketches/dp/0071784225/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1364494138&sr=1-1&keywords=arduino+sketches |title= Programming Arduino Getting Started with Sketches |publisher= [[McGraw-Hill]] |date=Nov 8, 2011 |accessdate=2013-03-28}}</ref>  Sketches are saved on the development computer as files with the file extension .ino.  Arduino Software (IDE) prior to 1.0 saved sketches with the extension .pde.\n\nThe Arduino IDE supports the languages [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] using special rules to organize code. The Arduino IDE supplies a [[software library]] called Wiring from the Wiring project, which provides many common input and output procedures. A typical Arduino C/C++ sketch consist of two functions that are compiled and linked with a program stub ''main()'' into an executable [[cyclic executive]] program:\n* ''setup()'': this function is called '''once''' when a sketch starts after power-up or reset. It is used to initialize variables, pin modes, start using libraries, etc.\n* ''loop()'': after setup() is called, this function is called repeatedly until the board powers off. It actively controls the Arduino board and allows the program to change or respond.\n\nAfter compiling and linking with the [[GNU toolchain]], also included with the IDE distribution, the Arduino IDE employs the program ''avrdude'' to convert the executable code into a text file in hexadecimal coding that is loaded into the Arduino board by a loader program in the board's firmware.\n\n=== Other IDE ===\nArduino programs may be written in any [[programming language]] with a compiler that produces binary machine code. Atmel provides a development environment for their microcontrollers, AVR Studio and the newer Atmel Studio, which can be used for programming Arduino.<ref name=\"AutoF7-38\"/><ref name=\"AutoF7-39\"/>\n\nArduino can be controlled using C/C++ interpreter [[Ch_(computer_programming)|Ch]] without the binary code. <ref name=\"AutoF7-46\"/>\n\n=== Sample programs ===\nThe bare minimum code<ref>[https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BareMinimum Tutorial: Bare Minimum code needed; arduino.cc]</ref> to start a sketch program consists of two functions setup()<ref>[https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Setup Documenation for setup() function; arduino.cc ]</ref> and loop().<ref>[https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Loop Documenation for loop() function; arduino.cc]</ref>\n\n<source lang=\"arduino\">\nvoid setup() {\n  // Put your setup code here, to run once at startup (power-up or reset). \n  // This executes before loop().\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  // Put your main code here, to run repeatedly.\n}\n</source>\n\nMost Arduino boards contain an LED and a load resistor connected between pin 13 and ground which is a convenient feature for many tests.<ref name=\"Blink Tutorial\" />\n\nA typical program for a beginning Arduino programmer blinks a [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) on and off. This program is usually loaded in the Arduino board by the manufacturer.

Massimo Banzi and Casey Reas (known for his work on [[Processing (programming language)|Processing]]) were supervisors for his thesis. The goal was to create low cost, simple tools for non-engineers to create digital projects. The Wiring platform consisted of a hardware PCB with an [[ATmega]]168 microcontroller, an IDE based on Processing and library functions to easily program the microcontroller.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://arduinohistory.github.io|title=Home|date=2016-01-01|website=arduinohistory.github.io|access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Massimo Banzi, with David Mellis (then an IDII student) and David Cuartielles, added support for the cheaper ATmega8 microcontroller to Wiring. But instead of continuing the work on Wiring, they forked (or copied) the Wiring source code and started running it as a separate project, called Arduino.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Arduino's initial core team consisted of Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe, Gianluca Martino, and David Mellis.<ref name=\"spectrum.ieee.org\">{{cite journal|date=26 Oct 2011|title=The Making of Arduino |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/the-making-of-arduino |journal=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |author=David Kushner}}</ref>\n\nThe name ''Arduino'' comes from a bar in Ivrea, where some of the founders of the project used to meet.

The founding bylaws of Arduino LLC specified that each of the five founders transfer ownership of the Arduino brand to the newly formed company.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAt the end of 2008, Gianluca Martino's company, Smart Projects, along with Microsoft{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}, registered the Arduino trademark in Italy and kept this a secret from the other cofounders for about two years. This was revealed when the Arduino company tried to register the trademark in other areas of the world (they originally registered only in the US), and discovered that it was already registered in Italy. Negotiations with Gianluca and his firm to bring the trademark under control of the original Arduino company failed. In 2014, Smart Projects began refusing to pay royalties. They then appointed a new CEO, Mr. Musto, who renamed the company to Arduino SRL and created a website named arduino.org, copying the graphics and layout of the original Arduino.cc. This resulted in a rift in the Arduino development team.
