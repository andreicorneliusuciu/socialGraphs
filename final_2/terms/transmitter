When a connected [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] is excited by this alternating current, the antenna emits [[radio wave]]s.\n\nIn addition to their use in [[broadcasting]], transmitters are necessary component parts of many electronic devices that communicate by [[radio communication|radio]], such as [[cell phone]]s, [[Wireless LAN|wireless computer networks]], [[Bluetooth]] enabled devices,  [[garage door opener]]s, [[two-way radio]]s in aircraft, ships, spacecraft, [[radar]] sets and navigational beacons.  The term ''transmitter'' is usually limited to equipment that generates radio waves for [[Communication engineering|communication]] purposes; or [[radiolocation]], such as [[radar]] and navigational transmitters.  Generators of radio waves for heating or industrial purposes, such as [[microwave oven]]s or [[diathermy]] equipment, are not usually called transmitters even though they often have similar circuits.\n\nThe term is popularly used more specifically to refer to a [[broadcast transmitter]], a transmitter used in [[broadcasting]], as in ''FM radio transmitter'' or ''[[television transmitter]]''.  This usage typically includes both the transmitter proper, the antenna, and often the building it is housed in.\n\nAn unrelated use of the term is in industrial [[process control]], where a \"transmitter\" is a [[telemetry]] device which converts measurements from a sensor into a signal, and sends it, usually via wires, to be received by some display or control device located a distance away.\n\n==Description==\nA transmitter can be a separate piece of electronic equipment, or an electrical circuit within another electronic device.  A transmitter and a [[Radio receiver|receiver]] combined in one unit is called a [[transceiver]].  The term transmitter is often abbreviated \"XMTR\" or \"TX\" in technical documents.  The purpose of most transmitters is [[radio communication]] of information over a distance.  The information is provided to the transmitter in the form of an electronic signal, such as an [[audio signal|audio]] (sound) signal from a microphone, a [[Video signal|video]] (TV) signal from a video camera, or in [[wireless networking]] devices a [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]] from a computer. The transmitter combines the information signal to be carried with the radio frequency signal which generates the radio waves, which is called the [[carrier signal]].  This process is called ''[[modulation]]''. The information can be added to the carrier in several different ways, in different types of transmitters.  In an [[amplitude modulation]] (AM) transmitter, the information is added to the radio signal by varying its [[amplitude]].  In a [[frequency modulation]] (FM) transmitter, it is added by varying the radio signal's [[frequency]] slightly.  Many other types of modulation are used.\n\nThe antenna may be enclosed inside the case or attached to the outside of the transmitter, as in portable devices such as cell phones, walkie-talkies, and [[garage door opener]]s.  In more powerful transmitters, the antenna may be located on top of a building or on a separate tower, and connected to the transmitter by a [[feed line]], that is a [[transmission line]].\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| header = Radio transmitters\n| image1   = \n| caption1 = \n| width1   = \n| image2   = KWNR Continental 816R-5B SN 247.jpg\n| caption2 = 35&nbsp;kW, Continental 816R-5B FM transmitter, belonging to American FM radio station KWNR broadcasting on 95.5&nbsp;MHz in Las Vegas \n| width2   = 200\n| image3   = Icom IC-746PRO.jpg\n| caption3   = Modern [[amateur radio]] [[transceiver]], the ICOM IC-746PRO.

These generated radio waves by a high voltage [[Electric spark|spark]] between two conductors.  Beginning in 1895 [[Guglielmo Marconi]] developed the first practical radio communication systems using spark transmitters.  They couldn't transmit [[audio signal|audio]] and instead transmitted information by [[telegraphy]], the operator spelling out text messages in [[Morse code]].    These [[spark-gap transmitter]]s were used during the first three decades of radio (1887-1917), called the [[wireless telegraphy]] or \"spark\" era.  Because they generated [[damped wave]]s, spark transmitters were electrically \"noisy\"; their energy was spread over a broad band of [[frequency|frequencies]], creating [[radio frequency interference|radio noise]] which interfered with other transmitters.  Two short-lived competing transmitter technologies came into use after the turn of the century, which were the first [[continuous wave]] transmitters: the [[Alexanderson alternator]] and [[Poulsen Arc|Poulsen arc]] transmitters, which were used into the 1920s. \n\nAll these early technologies were replaced by [[vacuum tube]] transmitters in the 1920s, which used  the [[electronic oscillator#Feedback oscillator|feedback oscillator]] invented by [[Edwin Armstrong]] and [[Alexander Meissner]] around 1912, based on the [[Audion]] ([[triode]]) vacuum tube invented by [[Lee De Forest]] in 1906.  Vacuum tube transmitters took over because they were inexpensive and produced [[continuous wave]]s, which could be [[Modulation|modulated]] to transmit audio (sound) using [[amplitude modulation]] (AM).  This made possible commercial AM [[radio broadcasting]], which began in about 1920.  Practical [[frequency modulation]] (FM) transmission was invented by [[Edwin Armstrong]] in 1933, who showed that it was less vulnerable to noise and static than AM, and the first FM radio station was licensed in 1937.  Experimental [[television]] transmission had been conducted by radio stations since the late 1920s, but practical [[television broadcasting]] didn't begin until the 1940s.  The development of [[radar]] during [[World War II]] was a great stimulus to the evolution of high frequency transmitters in the [[Ultrahigh frequency|UHF]] and [[microwave]] ranges, using new devices such as the [[magnetron]], [[klystron]], and [[traveling wave tube]].  The invention of the [[transistor]] allowed the development in the 1960s of small portable transmitters such as [[wireless microphone]]s and [[walkie-talkie]]s, although the first walkie-talkie was actually produced for the military during World War II using vacuum tubes.  In recent years, the need to conserve crowded [[radio spectrum]] bandwidth has driven the development of new types of transmitters such as [[spread spectrum]].\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| header   =\n| image1   = Marconi 1897 spark gap transmitter.jpg\n| caption1 = [[Guglielmo Marconi]]'s [[spark gap transmitter]], with which he performed the first experiments in practical radio communication in 1895-1897 \n| width1   = 240\n| image2   = Powerful spark gap transmitter.png\n| caption2 = High power spark gap transmitter in Australia around 1910.  \n| width2   = 127\n| image3   = Poulsen arc 1MW transmitter.jpg\n| caption3 = 1 MW US Navy [[Poulsen arc]] transmitter which generated continuous waves using an electric arc in a magnetic field, a technology used from 1903 until the 1920s  \n| width3   = 260\n| image4   = Alexanderson Alternator.jpg\n| caption4 = An [[Alexanderson alternator]], a huge rotating machine used as a radio transmitter for a short period from about 1910 until vacuum tube transmitters took over in the 1920s \n| width4   = 213\n| image5   = First vacuum tube AM radio transmitter.jpg\n| caption5 = One of the first [[vacuum tube]] [[amplitude modulation|AM]] radio transmitters, built by [[Lee De Forest]] in 1914.

The energy in such a rapidly reversing current can radiate off a conductor (the antenna) as [[electromagnetic wave]]s (radio waves).  The transmitter also impresses information such as an audio or video signal onto the radio frequency current to be carried by the radio waves.  When they strike the antenna of a [[radio receiver]], the waves excite similar (but less powerful) radio frequency currents in it.  The radio receiver extracts the information from the received waves.  A practical radio transmitter usually consists of these parts:\n*A [[power supply]] circuit to transform the input electrical power to the higher [[voltage]]s needed to produce the required power output.\n*An [[electronic oscillator]] circuit to generate the [[radio frequency]] signal.  This usually generates a [[sine wave]] of constant [[amplitude]] often called the [[carrier wave]], because it serves to \"carry\" the information through space.  In most modern transmitters this is a [[crystal oscillator]] in which the frequency is precisely controlled by the vibrations of a [[quartz crystal]].\n*A [[modulator]] circuit to add the information to be transmitted to the carrier wave produced by the oscillator.  This is done by varying some aspect of the carrier wave.  The information is provided to the transmitter either in the form of an [[audio signal]], which represents [[sound]], a [[video signal]], or for data in the form of a [[Binary numeral system|binary]] [[Digital data|digital]] signal.  \n**In an AM ([[amplitude modulation]]) transmitter the [[amplitude]] (strength) of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to the modulation signal.  \n**In an FM ([[frequency modulation]]) transmitter the [[frequency]] of the carrier is varied by the modulation signal.   \n**In an FSK ([[frequency-shift keying]]) transmitter, which transmits digital data, the frequency of the carrier is shifted between two frequencies which represent the two binary digits, 0 and 1.  \n:Many other types of [[modulation]] are also used.  In large transmitters the oscillator and modulator together are often referred to as the ''exciter''.\n*An RF [[amplifier]] to increase the power of the signal, to increase the range of the radio waves.\n*An [[impedance matching]] ([[antenna tuner]]) circuit to match the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the transmitter to the impedance of the antenna (or the [[transmission line]] to the antenna), to transfer power efficiently to the antenna.  If these impedances are not equal, it causes a condition called [[standing wave]]s, in which the power is reflected back from the antenna toward the transmitter, wasting power and sometimes overheating the transmitter.  \nIn higher frequency transmitters, in the [[Ultrahigh frequency|UHF]] and [[microwave]] range, oscillators that operate stably at the output frequency cannot be built.  In these transmitters the oscillator usually operates at a lower frequency, and is multiplied by [[frequency multiplier]]s to get a signal at the desired frequency.\n\n==Legal restrictions==\nIn most parts of the world, use of transmitters is strictly controlled by law because of the potential for dangerous [[Electromagnetic interference|interference]] with other radio transmissions  (for example to emergency communications).  Transmitters must be licensed by governments, under a variety of license classes depending on use such as [[broadcast]], [[marine radio]], [[Airband]], [[Amateur radio|Amateur]] and are restricted to certain frequencies and power levels. A body called the [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU) allocates the [[frequency]] bands in the [[radio spectrum]] to various classes of users.  In some classes each transmitter is given a unique [[call sign]] consisting of a string of letters and numbers which must be used as an identifier in transmissions.  The operator of the transmitter usually must hold a government license, such as a [[general radiotelephone operator license]], which is obtained by passing a test demonstrating adequate technical and legal knowledge of safe radio operation.\n\nAn exception is made allowing the unlicensed use of low-power short-range transmitters in devices such as [[cell phone]]s, [[cordless telephone]]s,  [[wireless microphone]]s,  [[walkie-talkie]]s, [[Wifi]] and [[Bluetooth]] devices, [[garage door opener]]s, and [[baby monitor]]s.  In the US, these fall under [[Part 15]] of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulations.  Although they can be operated without a license, these devices still generally must be [[Type approval|type-approved]] before sale.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of transmission sites]]\n*[[Radio transmitter design]]\n*[[Transmitter station]]\n*[[Transposer]]\n*[[Television transmitter]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{commons category|Radio transmitters}}\n*[http://www.itu.int/net/home/index.aspx International Telecommunication Union]\n*[http://hawkins.pair.com/radio.html Jim Hawkins' Radio and Broadcast Technology Page]\n*[http://www.wcov.com/technical/transmitter.html WCOV-TV's Transmitter Technical Website]\n*[http://www.aerialsandtv.com/digitalnationwide.html Major UK television transmitters including change of group information, see Transmitter Planning section.]\n*[http://www.wolfbane.com/ukdtt.htm Details of UK digital television transmitters]\n*[http://www.the-moores.co.uk/MediaGallery/Default.aspx?directory=56 Richard Moore's Anorak Zone Photo Gallery of UK TV and Radio transmission sites]\n\n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n[[Category:Broadcast transmitters| ]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications equipment]]\n[[Category:Radar]]"}]}}}}
