Line editors precede screen-based text editors and originated in an era when a computer operator typically interacted with a [[teleprinter]] (essentially a [[computer printer|printer]] with a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]]), with no video display, and no ability to navigate a cursor interactively in a document. Line editors were also a feature of many [[home computers]], avoiding the need for a more memory-intensive full-screen editor.\n\nLine editors are limited to typewriter keyboard text-oriented input and output methods. Most edits are a line-at-a-time. Typing, editing, and document display do not occur simultaneously.  Typically, typing does not enter text directly into the document.  Instead, users modify the document text by entering terse commands on a text-only terminal.  Commands and text, and corresponding output from the editor, will scroll up from the bottom of the screen in the order that they are entered or printed to the screen. Although the commands typically indicate the line(s) they modify, displaying the edited text within the context of larger portions of the document requires a separate command.\nLine editors keep a reference to the 'current line' to which the entered commands usually are applied. In contrast, modern screen based editors allow the user to interactively and directly navigate, select, and modify portions of the document. Generally line numbers or a search based context (especially when making changes within lines) are used to specify which part of the document is to be edited or displayed.\n\nEarly line editors included [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]] and [[QED (text editor)|QED]], both dating back to pre-[[Unix|UNIX]] era OSes.  [[Emacs]] grew out of a set of macros written for [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]].\nThe [[Unix|UNIX]] editor [[ed (text editor)|ed]] is a classic example of a line editor. For the first 10 years of the PC, the only editor provided in [[DOS]] was the [[Edlin]] line editor.\n\nLine editors are still used non-interactively in [[shell script]]s. Patch systems such as [[patch (Unix)]] traditionally used [[diff]] data that was a script of [[ed (text editor)|ed]] commands. They are also used in many [[MUD]] systems, though many people prefer to edit text on their own computer and then use their MUD client's upload feature to paste the text directly in the line editor.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]]\n* [[QED (text editor)|QED]]\n* [[Visual editor]]\n* [[ed (text editor)|ed]]\n* [[Edlin]]\n* [[GNU Readline]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Line Editor}}\n[[Category:Line editor]]"}]}}}}
