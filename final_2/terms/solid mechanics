It has specific applications in many other areas, such as understanding the [[anatomy]] of living beings, and the design of [[dental prosthesis|dental prostheses]] and [[surgical implant]]s.  One of the most common practical applications of solid mechanics is the [[Euler-Bernoulli beam equation]]. Solid mechanics extensively uses [[tensor]]s to describe stresses, strains, and the relationship between them.\n\n==Relationship to continuum mechanics==\nAs shown in the following table, solid mechanics inhabits a central place within continuum mechanics.  The field of [[rheology]] presents an overlap between solid and [[fluid mechanics|fluid]] mechanics.\n{{Continuum mechanics context}}\n\n==Response models==\nA material has a rest shape and its shape departs away from the rest shape due to stress. The amount of departure from rest shape is called [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformation]], the proportion of deformation to original size is called strain. If the applied stress is sufficiently low (or the imposed strain is small enough), almost all solid materials behave in such a way that the strain is directly proportional to the stress; the coefficient of the proportion is called the [[modulus of elasticity]].  This region of deformation is known as the linearly elastic region.\n\nIt is most common for analysts in solid mechanics to use [[linear]] material models, due to ease of computation. However, real materials often exhibit [[non-linear]] behavior. As new materials are used and old ones are pushed to their limits, non-linear material models are becoming more common.\n\nThere are four basic models that describe how a solid responds to an applied stress:\n# [[Elasticity (physics)|Elastically]] \u2013 When an applied stress is removed, the material returns to its undeformed state. Linearly elastic materials, those that deform proportionally to the applied load, can be described by the [[linear elasticity]] equations such as [[Hooke's law]].\n# [[Viscoelasticity|Viscoelastically]] \u2013 These are materials that behave elastically, but also have [[friction|damping]]: when the stress is applied and removed, work has to be done against the damping effects and is converted in heat within the material resulting in a [[hysteresis loop]] in the stress\u2013strain curve. This implies that the material response has time-dependence.\n# [[Plasticity (physics)|Plastically]] \u2013 Materials that behave elastically generally do so when the applied stress is less than a yield value. When the stress is greater than the yield stress, the material behaves plastically and does not return to its previous state. That is, deformation that occurs after yield is permanent.\n# Thermoelasticity (physics) - There is coupling of mechanical with thermal responses. In general, thermoelasticity is concerned with elastic solids under conditions that are neither isothermal nor adiabatic. The simplest theory involves the [[Fourier's law]] of heat conduction, as opposed to advanced theories with physically more realistic models.\n\n==Timeline==\n*1452\u20131519 [[Leonardo da Vinci]] made many contributions\n*1638: [[Galileo Galilei]] published the book \"[[Two New Sciences]]\" in which he examined the failure of simple structures\n[[File:Galilee.jpg|left|thumb| [[Galileo Galilei]] published the book \"[[Two New Sciences]]\" in which he examined the failure of simple structures]]\n*1660: [[Hooke's law]] by [[Robert Hooke]]\n*1687: [[Isaac Newton]] published \"[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]\" which contains [[Newton's laws of motion]]\n[[File:Sir Isaac Newton by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt.jpg|right|thumb| [[Isaac Newton]] published \"[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]\" which contains the [[Newton's laws of motion]]]]\n*1750: [[Euler\u2013Bernoulli beam equation]]\n*1700\u20131782: [[Daniel Bernoulli]] introduced the principle of [[virtual work]]\n*1707\u20131783: [[Leonhard Euler]] developed the theory of [[buckling]] of columns\n[[File:Leonhard Euler 2.jpg|thumb|200px| [[Leonhard Euler]] developed the theory of [[buckling]] of columns]]\n*1826: [[Claude-Louis Navier]] published a treatise on the elastic behaviors of structures\n*1873: [[Carlo Alberto Castigliano]] presented his dissertation \"Intorno ai sistemi elastici\", which contains [[Castigliano's method|his theorem]] for computing displacement as partial derivative of the strain energy.
