This hole is sealed with a metal of low melting point that flows away if a pre-determined, high temperature is reached. The initial use of the fusible plug was as a safety precaution against low water levels in [[Boiler|steam engine boilers]], but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as [[air conditioning]] systems and tanks for transporting [[corrosive]] or [[liquefied petroleum gas|liquefied petroleum]] gasses.\n\n==Purpose==\n[[File:Fusible plug, view 3.jpg|thumb|A modern fusible plug. The core of low melting-point metal is visible.]]\nA fusible plug operates as a safety valve when dangerous temperatures, rather than dangerous pressures, are reached in a closed vessel. In [[steam engine]]s  the fusible plug is screwed into the crown sheet (the top plate) of the [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]], typically extending about an inch (25mm) into the water space above. Its purpose is to act as a last-resort safety device in the event of the water level falling dangerously low: when the top of the plug is out of the water it overheats, the low-melting-point core melts away and the resulting noisy release of steam into the firebox serves to warn the operators of the danger before the top of the firebox itself runs completely dry, which could result in catastrophic failure of the boiler. The temperature of the flue gases in a steam engine firebox can reach 1000&nbsp;\u00b0F (550&nbsp;\u00b0C), at which temperature [[copper]], from which historically most fireboxes were made, softens to a state which can no longer sustain the boiler pressure and a severe explosion will result if water is not put into the boiler quickly and the fire removed or extinguished.<ref name=\"BTCenginemen\" >{{cite book\n  |last=Staff\n  |title=Handbook for railway steam locomotive enginemen\n  |publisher=[[British Transport Commission]]\n  |location=London\n  |year=1957\n  |page=53\n  |chapter=The Boiler: Boiler Mountings and Details\n}}</ref> The hole through the plug is too small to have any great effect in reducing the steam pressure and the small amount of water, if any, that passes through it is not expected to have any great impact in quenching the fire.<ref>{{cite book\n  |last=Snell  |first=John\n  |title=Mechanical Engineering: Railways\n  |publisher=Longman  |location=London\n  |year=1971\n  |page=31\n  |chapter=The beginning of steam power\n  |isbn=0-582-12793-9\n}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe device was invented in 1803 by [[Richard Trevithick]], the  proponent of high-pressure (as opposed to [[Watt steam engine|atmospheric]]) steam engines, in consequence of an explosion in one of his new boilers. His detractors were eager to denounce the whole concept of high-pressure steam, but Trevithick proved that the accident happened because his fireman had neglected to keep the boiler full of water. He publicised his invention widely, without patent, to counter these criticisms.<ref>{{cite book\n  |last=Payton  |first=Philip\n  |year=2004\n  |title=Trevithick, Richard (1771\u20131833)\n  |series=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\n  |publisher=Oxford University Press\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Kirby\n  | first = Richard Shelton\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = Engineering in History\n  | publisher = McGraw Hill\n  | year = 1956\n  | location =New York\n  | oclc = 561620\n  | page = 176\n  | isbn = 0-486-26412-2\n|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n===Experiments===\nExperiments conducted by the [[Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology|Franklin Institute]], Boston, in the 1830s had initially cast doubt on the practice of adding water as soon as the escape of steam through the device was noted. A steam boiler was fitted with a small observation window of glass and heated beyond its normal [[operating temperature]] with the water level below the top of the firebox. When water was added it was found that the pressure rose suddenly and the observation glass shattered. The report concluded that the high temperature of the metal had vaporised the added water too quickly and that an explosion was the inevitable result.<ref>Staff of the [[Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology]] (undated ca 1830): ''Steam-boiler explosions''.

ISBN 1-4255-0590-2.</ref> It was not until 1852 that this assumption was challenged: Thomas Redmond, one of the Institute's own inspectors,  specifically ruled out this theory in his investigation into the  boiler explosion on the steam ship ''Redstone'' on the [[Ohio River]] on 3 April that year.<ref>{{cite journal\n  |doi=10.1016/0016-0032(52)90891-0\n  |last=Bakewell  |first=Thomas\n  |year=1852\n  |title=Explosion of the steamer Redstone\n  |journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute\n  |publisher=Franklin Institute  |location=Philadelphia, PA\n  |volume=53\n  |pages=413\n  |quote=...want of water contributes only [insofar] as  the metal may be heated and weakened thereby; that in no case of water on a heated part of the boiler can steam be generated in quantity so suddenly as to explode the boiler...\n}}</ref> A 1907 investigation in Wales came to a similar conclusion: a [[steam locomotive]] belonging to the [[Rhymney Railway]] was inadvertently sent out with its safety valves wrongly assembled. The pressure in the boiler built up to the extent that the [[injectors]] failed; the crown sheet became uncovered, was weakened by the heat of the fire and violently blew apart. The investigation, led by Colonel Druitt of the [[Railway Inspectorate]], dismissed the theory that the enginemen had succeeded in starting the  injectors and that the sudden flood of cold water had caused such a generation of steam that the boiler burst. He quoted the results of experiments by the [[Manchester Steam Users' Association]], a national boiler certification and insurance body, that proved that the weight of copper present (considered with its [[specific heat]]) was insufficient to generate enough steam to raise the boiler pressure at all. Indeed, the addition of cold water had caused the pressure to fall. From then on it was accepted that the correct action in the event of the operation of the fusible plug was to add water.<ref>Hewison (1983: 116\u2013117)</ref>\n\n=== Cored fusible plugs ===\n[[File:'National' fusible plug, section (Army Service Corps Training, Mechanical Transport, 1911).jpg|thumb|Fusible plug with a core]]\nThe original design was a simple solid plug filled with a slug of low-melting-point alloy. When this melts, it first melts as a narrow channel through the plug. Steam and water immediately begins to escape through this. The cored fusible plug was developed in the 1860s to give a wide opening as soon as the alloy softens. This version has a solid brass or bronze centre, soldered into place by a layer of the low-melting-point alloy. When overheated, the plug does not release any steam or water until the alloy melts sufficiently to release the centre plug. The plug now fails dramatically, opening its entire bore immediately. This full-bore jet is then more likely to be noticed.<ref>{{cite journal|date=1 September 1866|title=Improved fusible plug for steam boilers|journal=[[Scientific American]]|publisher=Munn and company|location=New York|page=158}}</ref>\n\n=== Un-noticed melted plugs ===\nA drawback to the device was found on 7 March 1948, when the firebox crown sheet of ''Princess Alexandra'', a [[LMS Coronation Class|Coronation Pacific]] of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]], failed while hauling a passenger train from Glasgow to London. Enquiries established that both [[Sight glass|water gauges]] were defective and on a journey earlier that day one or both of the fusible plugs had melted, but this had gone unnoticed by the engine crew because of the strong draught carrying the escaping steam away from them.<ref>{{cite book\n  |last=Hewison  |first=Christian H.\n  |title=Locomotive Boiler Explosions \n  |publisher=[[David & Charles]]  |location=Newton Abbot, England\n  |year=1983\n  |pages=134\u2013137\n  |isbn=0-7153-8305-1\n  |ref=Hewison, Locomotive Boiler Explosions \n}}</ref>\n\n== Maintenance ==\n=== Alloy composition ===\nInvestigation showed the importance of the alloy on plug ageing. Alloys were initially favoured as they offered lower [[eutectic]] melting points than pure metals. It was found though that alloys aged poorly and could encourage the development of a matrix of oxides on the water surface of the plug, this matrix having a dangerously high melting point that made the plug inoperable. In 1888 the US Steamboat Inspection Service made a  requirement that  plugs were to be made of pure [[Bangka Island#Economy|banca tin]] and replaced annually.<ref name=\"Freeman1930\" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Rose|first=Joshua|title=Steam boilers: a practical treatise on boiler construction and examination|publisher=H.

Zinc contamination was regarded as so serious a problem that the case of the plugs was also changed from [[brass]] (a copper-zinc alloy) to a zinc-free copper-tin [[bronze]], to avoid the risk of zinc migrating from the housing into the alloy plug.<ref name=\"Freeman1930\">{{cite journal|last=Freeman|first=John R|author2=Scherrer, J.A.|author3=Rosenberg, S.
