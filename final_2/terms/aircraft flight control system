[[Aircraft engine controls]] are also considered as flight controls as they change speed.\n\nThe fundamentals of aircraft controls are explained in [[flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)|flight dynamics]]. This article centers on the operating mechanisms of the flight controls. The basic system in use on aircraft first appeared in a readily recognizable form as early as April 1908, on [[Louis Bl\u00e9riot]]'s [[Bl\u00e9riot VIII]] pioneer-era monoplane design.<ref>{{cite book |title=Bl\u00e9riot XI, The Story of a Classic Aircraft |last=Crouch |first=Tom |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1982 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |location= |isbn=0-87474-345-1 |page= |pages=21 & 22 |url=}}</ref>\n\n==Cockpit controls==\n\n=== Primary controls ===\nGenerally, the primary cockpit flight controls are arranged as follows:<ref name=\"SaR\">Langewiesche, Wolfgang. [https://books.google.com/books?id=CPdDju21zt0C Stick and Rudder: An Explanation of the Art of Flying], McGraw-Hill Professional, 1990, ISBN 0-07-036240-8, ISBN 978-0-07-036240-6.</ref>\n* a [[Yoke (aircraft)|control yoke]] (also known as a control column), [[centre stick]] or [[side-stick]] (the latter two also colloquially known as a control or [[joystick]]), governs the aircraft's [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)|roll]] and [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)|pitch]] by moving the [[ailerons]] (or activating [[wing warping]] on some very early aircraft designs) when turned or deflected left and right, and moves the [[elevator (aircraft)|elevators]] when moved backwards or forwards\n* rudder pedals, or the earlier, pre-1919 \"rudder bar\", to control [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)|yaw]], which move the [[rudder]]; left foot forward will move the rudder left for instance.\n* throttle controls to control engine speed or [[thrust]] for powered aircraft.\n\nThe control yokes also vary greatly amongst aircraft. There are yokes where roll is controlled by rotating the yoke clockwise/counterclockwise (like steering a car) and pitch is controlled by tilting the control column towards you or away from you, but in others the pitch is controlled by sliding the yoke into and out of the instrument panel (like most Cessnas, such as the 152 and 172), and in some the roll is controlled by sliding the whole yoke to the left and right (like the Cessna 162). Centre sticks also vary between aircraft. Some are directly connected to the control surfaces using cables,<ref>[http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Theories_of_Flight/control/TH28.htm Control surfaces directly controlled using cables]</ref> others (fly-by-wire airplanes) have a computer in between which then controls the electrical actuators.\n\n[[File:Sports Aviation - Issy-les-Moulineaux (10 septembre) - Le Bl\u00e9riot VIII \u2026 (7843390842).jpg|thumb|right|Bl\u00e9riot VIII at [[Issy-les-Moulineaux]], the first flightworthy aircraft design to have the initial form of modern flight controls for the pilot]]\nEven when an aircraft uses variant flight control surfaces such as a [[V-tail|V-tail ruddervator]], [[flaperon]]s, or [[elevon]]s, to avoid pilot confusion the aircraft's flight control system will still be designed so that the stick or yoke controls pitch and roll conventionally, as will the rudder pedals for yaw.<ref name=\"SaR\" />  The basic pattern for modern flight controls was pioneered by French aviation figure [[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]], with fellow French aviator [[Louis Bl\u00e9riot]] popularizing Esnault-Pelterie's control format initially on Louis' [[Bl\u00e9riot VIII]] monoplane in April 1908, and standardizing the format on the July 1909 Channel-crossing [[Bl\u00e9riot XI]]. Flight control has long been taught in such fashion for many decades, as popularized in [[ab initio]] instructional books such as the 1944 work [[Stick and Rudder]].\n\nIn some aircraft, the control surfaces are not manipulated with a linkage. In ultralight aircraft and motorized hang gliders, for example, there is no mechanism at all. Instead, the pilot just grabs the lifting surface by hand (using a rigid frame that hangs from its underside) and moves it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n===Secondary controls===\n{{Main|Trim tab|Flap (aircraft)|Air brake (aircraft)|Spoiler (aeronautics)|Leading edge slats|Variable-sweep wing}}\nIn addition to the primary flight controls for roll, pitch, and yaw, there are often secondary controls available to give the pilot finer control over flight or to ease the workload.  The most commonly available control is a wheel or other device to control [[trim tab|elevator trim]], so that the pilot does not have to maintain constant backward or forward pressure to hold a specific pitch [[Aircraft attitude|attitude]]<ref>Thom,1988. p. 87.</ref> (other types of trim, for [[rudder]] and [[ailerons]], are common on larger aircraft but may also appear on smaller ones).  Many aircraft have [[flap (aircraft)|wing flaps]], controlled by a switch or a mechanical lever or in some cases are fully automatic by computer control, which alter the shape of the wing for improved control at the slower speeds used for take-off and landing.   Other secondary flight control systems may be available, including [[Leading edge slats|slats]], [[Spoiler (aeronautics)|spoilers]], [[Air brake (aircraft)|air brakes]] and [[variable-sweep wing]]s.\n\n==Flight control systems==\n\n===Mechanical===\n[[File:Tiger cables.JPG|thumb|right|[[de Havilland Tiger Moth]] elevator and rudder cables]] \nMechanical or manually operated flight control systems are the most basic method of controlling an aircraft. They were used in early aircraft and are currently used in small aircraft where the aerodynamic forces are not excessive. Very early aircraft, such as the [[Wright Flyer|Wright Flyer I]], [[Bl\u00e9riot XI]] and [[Fokker Eindecker]] used a system of [[wing warping]] where no conventionally hinged control surfaces were used on the wing, and sometimes not even for pitch control as on the Wright Flyer I and original versions of the 1909 [[Etrich Taube]], which only had a hinged/pivoting rudder in addition to the warping-operated pitch and roll controls.<ref>Taylor, 1990. p. 116.</ref> A manual flight control system uses a collection of mechanical parts such as pushrods, tension cables, pulleys, counterweights, and sometimes chains to transmit the forces applied to the cockpit controls directly to the control surfaces. [[Turnbuckle]]s are often used to adjust control cable tension. The [[Cessna Skyhawk]] is a typical example of an aircraft that uses this type of system. [[Gust lock]]s are often used on parked aircraft with mechanical systems to protect the control surfaces and linkages from damage from wind. Some aircraft have gust locks fitted as part of the control system.<ref>Thom,1988. p. 153.</ref>\n \nIncreases in the control surface area required by large aircraft or higher loads caused by high [[airspeed]]s in small aircraft lead to a large increase in the forces needed to move them, consequently complicated mechanical [[gear]]ing arrangements were developed to extract maximum [[mechanical advantage]] in order to reduce the forces required from the pilots.<ref name=\"Taylor118\">Taylor, 1990. p. 118.</ref> This arrangement can be found on bigger or higher performance [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] aircraft such as the [[Fokker 50]].\n\nSome  mechanical flight control systems use [[servo tab]]s that provide aerodynamic assistance. Servo tabs are small surfaces hinged to the control surfaces. The flight control mechanisms move these tabs, aerodynamic forces in turn move, or assist the movement of the control surfaces reducing the amount of mechanical forces needed. This arrangement was used in early piston-engined transport aircraft and in early jet transports.<ref>Thom,1988. p. 86.</ref> The Boeing 737 incorporates a system, whereby in the unlikely event of total hydraulic system failure, it automatically and seamlessly reverts to being controlled via servo-tab.\n\n===Hydro-mechanical===\nThe complexity and weight of mechanical flight control systems increase considerably with the size and performance of the aircraft. [[hydraulic machinery|Hydraulically powered control surface]]s help to overcome these limitations. With hydraulic flight control systems, the aircraft's size and performance are limited by economics rather than a pilot's muscular strength. At first, only-partially boosted systems were used in which the pilot could still feel some of the aerodynamic loads on the control surfaces (feedback).<ref name=\"Taylor118\">Taylor, 1990. p. 118.</ref>\n\nA hydro-mechanical flight control system has two parts:\n*The ''mechanical circuit'', which links the cockpit controls with the hydraulic circuits. Like the mechanical flight control system, it consists of rods, cables, pulleys, and sometimes chains.\n*The ''hydraulic circuit'', which has hydraulic pumps, reservoirs, filters, pipes, valves and actuators. The actuators are powered by the hydraulic pressure generated by the pumps in the hydraulic circuit. The actuators convert hydraulic pressure into control surface movements. The [[electro-hydraulic servo valve]]s control the movement of the actuators.\n\nThe pilot's movement of a control causes the mechanical circuit to open the matching servo valve in the hydraulic circuit. The hydraulic circuit powers the actuators which then move the control surfaces. As the actuator moves, the [[electro-hydraulic servo valve|servo valve]] is closed by a mechanical [[feedback]] linkage - one that stops movement of the control surface at the desired position.\n\nThis arrangement was found in the older-designed jet transports and in some high-performance aircraft. Examples include the [[Antonov An-225]] and the [[Lockheed SR-71]].\n\n====Artificial feel devices====\nWith purely mechanical flight control systems, the aerodynamic forces on the control surfaces are transmitted through the mechanisms and are felt directly by the pilot, allowing tactile feedback of airspeed. With hydromechanical flight control systems, however, the load on the surfaces cannot be felt and there is a risk of overstressing the aircraft through excessive control surface movement. To overcome this problem, artificial feel systems can be used. For example, for the controls of the [[RAF]]'s [[Avro Vulcan]] jet [[bomber]] and the [[RCAF]]'s [[Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow]] supersonic interceptor (both 1950s-era designs), the required force feedback was achieved by a spring device.<ref>The Arrowheads, pages 57-58, 83-85 (for CF-105 Arrow only).</ref>  The [[Fulcrum (mechanics)|fulcrum]] of this device was moved in proportion to the square of the air speed (for the elevators) to give increased resistance at higher speeds. For the controls of the American [[Vought]] [[F-8 Crusader]] and the LTV [[A-7 Corsair II]] warplanes, a 'bob-weight' was used in the pitch axis of the control stick, giving  force feedback that was proportional to the airplane's normal acceleration.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n====Stick shaker====\n{{Main|Stick shaker}}\nA [[stick shaker]] is a device (available in some hydraulic aircraft) that is attached to the control column, which shakes the control column when the aircraft is about to stall. Also in some aircraft like the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] there is/was a back-up electrical power supply that the pilot can turn on to re-activate the stick shaker in case the hydraulic connection to the stick shaker is lost.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n===Fly-by-wire control systems===\n{{Main|Fly-by-wire}}\nA fly-by-wire (FBW) system replaces manual flight control of an aircraft with an electronic interface. The movements of flight controls are converted to electronic signals transmitted by wires (hence the fly-by-wire term), and flight control computers determine how to move the [[actuators]] at each control surface to provide the expected response. Commands from the computers are also input without the pilot's knowledge to stabilize the aircraft and perform other tasks. Electronics for aircraft flight control systems are part of the field known as [[avionics]].\n\nFly-by-optics, also known as ''fly-by-light'', is a further development using [[fiber optic cable]]s. This has an added advantage when sensitive electro-magnetic sensors will be operating aboard the aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Research==\nSeveral technology research and development efforts exist to integrate the functions of flight control systems such as [[aileron]]s, [[elevator (aircraft)|elevators]], [[elevon]]s, [[flap (aircraft)|flap]]s, and [[flaperon]]s into wings to perform the aerodynamic purpose with the advantages of less: mass, cost, drag, [[inertia]] (for faster, stronger control response), complexity (mechanically simpler, fewer moving parts or surfaces, less maintenance), and [[radar cross section]] for [[stealth technology|stealth]]. These may be used in many [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs) and 6th generation [[fighter aircraft]]. Two promising approaches are flexible wings, and fluidics.\n\n===Flexible wings===\n{{Main article|Flexible wing}}\n\nIn flexible wings, much or all of a wing surface can change shape in flight to deflect air flow much like an [[ornithopter]]. [[Adaptive compliant wing]]s are a military and commercial effort.<ref>{{citation |last=Scott |first=William B. |title=Morphing Wings |newspaper=Aviation Week & Space Technology |date=27 November 2006 |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flxsys.com/aerospace.shtml |title=FlexSys Inc.: Aerospace |accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flxsys.com/pdf/NATO_Conf_Paper-KOTA.pdf |title=Mission Adaptive Compliant Wing \u2013 Design, Fabrication and Flight Test |first=Sridhar |last=Kota |first2=Russell |last2=Osborn |first3=Gregory |last3=Ervin |first4=Dragan |last4=Maric |first5=Peter |last5=Flick |first6=Donald |last6=Paul |publisher=FlexSys Inc., Air Force Research Laboratory |location=Ann Arbor, MI; Dayton, OH, U.S.A. |accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref> The [[X-53 Active Aeroelastic Wing]] was a US Air Force, [[NASA]], and [[Boeing]] effort.\n\n===Fluidics===\nIn [[fluidics]], forces in vehicles occur via circulation control, in which larger more complex mechanical parts are replaced by smaller simpler fluidic systems (slots which emit air flows) where larger forces in fluids are diverted by smaller jets or flows of fluid intermittently, to change the direction of vehicles.<ref>{{cite journal\n |author=P John\n |title=The flapless air vehicle integrated industrial research (FLAVIIR) programme in aeronautical engineering\n |journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering\n |volume=224\n |issue=4\n |pages=355\u2013363\n |publisher=London: Mechanical Engineering Publications\n |year=2010\n |url=http://journals.pepublishing.com/content/m9r3684g2874w026/\n |issn= 0954-4100\n |doi=10.1243/09544100JAERO580}}</ref><ref>\n{{Cite web\n  |title= Showcase UAV Demonstrates Flapless Flight\n  |publisher= BAE Systems\n  |year= 2010\n  |url= http://www.baesystems.com/AboutUs/ShowcaseUAVDemonstratesFlaplessFlight/\n  |accessdate= 2010-12-22}}</ref> In this use, fluidics promises lower mass, costs (up to 50% less), and very low [[inertia]] and response times, and simplicity.
