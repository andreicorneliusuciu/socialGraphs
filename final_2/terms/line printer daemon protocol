The original implementation of LPD was in the [[Berkeley printing system]] in the [[BSD]] UNIX operating system; the [[LPRng]] project also supports that protocol.  The [[Common Unix Printing System]] (or CUPS), which is more common on modern [[Linux]] distributions and also found on [[Mac OS X]], supports LPD as well as the [[Internet Printing Protocol|Internet Printing Protocol (IPP)]]. Commercial solutions are available that also use Berkeley printing protocol components, where more robust functionality and performance is necessary than is available from LPR/LPD (or CUPS) alone (such as might be required in large corporate environments).  The LPD Protocol Specification is documented in RFC 1179.<ref>[http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1179.txt RFC1179]  Line Printer Daemon Protocol, August 1990, edited by L. McLaughlin III.</ref>\n\n==Usage ==\nA server for the LPD protocol listens for requests on TCP port 515.  A request begins with a byte containing the request code, followed by the arguments to the request, and is terminated by an ASCII [[Newline|LF]] character.\n\nAn LPD printer is identified by the IP address of the server machine and the queue name on that machine.  Many different queue names may exist in one LPD server, with each queue having unique settings.  Note that the LPD queue name is case sensitive.  Some modern implementations of LPD on network printers might ignore the case or queue name altogether and send all jobs to the same printer.  Others have the option to automatically create a new queue when a print job with a new queue name is received.  This helps to simplify the setup of the LPD server.<ref>[http://gpvno.co.za/ Winet]'s InetLPD server documentation.</ref>  Some companies (e.g. D-Link in model DP-301P+) have a tradition of calling the queue name \u201clpt1\u201d or \u201cLPT1\u201d.  \n\nA printer that supports LPD/LPR is sometimes referred to as a \"TCP/IP printer\" ([[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] is used to establish connections between printers and clients on a network), although that term would be equally applicable to a printer that supports the Internet Printing Protocol.\n\n==See also ==\n\n*[[Lp (Unix)]]\n*[[LPRng]]\n*[[Legacy printing]]\n*[[Common Unix Printing System|Common Unix Printing System (CUPS)]]\n*[[RLPR]]\n*[[System V printing system]]\n*[[Spooling]]\n*[[Print server]]\n*[[Application layer]]\n*[[Foomatic]]\n\n==References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links ==\n* [https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=lpd&sektion=8 FreeBSD LPD Man Page]\n\n[[Category:Computer printing]]\n[[Category:Network protocols]]\n[[Category:Unix]]\n\n{{Network-software-stub}}"}]}}}}
