Some of the fuel and oxidizer is burned separately to power the pumps and then discarded. Most gas-generator engines use the fuel for nozzle cooling.]]\n\nThe '''gas-generator cycle''' is a power cycle of a [[bipropellant rocket]] [[rocket engine|engine]]. Some of the propellant is burned in a [[gas generator]] and the resulting hot gas is used to power the engine's pumps. The gas is then exhausted. Because something is \"thrown away\" this type of engine is also known as '''open cycle'''.\n\nThere are several advantages to the gas-generator cycle over its counterpart, the [[Staged combustion cycle (rocket)|staged combustion cycle]]. The gas generator turbine does not need to deal with the counter pressure of injecting the exhaust into the combustion chamber. This simplifies plumbing and turbine design, and results in a less expensive and lighter engine.\n\nThe main disadvantage is lost efficiency due to discarded propellant. Gas-generator cycles tend to have lower specific impulse than staged combustion cycles.\n\nAs in most [[cryogenic rocket engine]]s, some of the fuel in a gas-generator cycle may be used to cool the nozzle and combustion chamber (regenerative cooling). Available construction materials cannot withstand the extreme temperatures of rocket combustion processes by themselves, while cooling permits the use of rocket engines for relatively long burn times. Without any rocket combustion chamber and nozzle heat mitigation, the engine would fail catastrophically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4404/ch2-6.htm|title=ch2-6|author=|date=|work=nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Usage==\nGas-generator combustion engines include the following:\n*[[Vulcain]],<ref name=\"vulcain\">{{cite web | url=http://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bullet102/Coulon102.pdf | title=Vulcain-2 Cryogenic Engine Passes First Test with New Nozzle Extension | publisher=ESA}}</ref> [[HM7B]]\n*[[Merlin (rocket engine)|Merlin rocket engine]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.spacex.com/falcon1.php#merlin_engine | title=SpaceX Merlin Engine | publisher=SpaceX}}</ref>\n*[[RS-68]]<ref name=\"D4\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spacelaunchreport.com/delta4.html |title=Delta 4 Data Sheet}}</ref>\n*[[RS-27A]]<ref name=\"pump\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pwrengineering.com/articles/turbopump.htm |title=Turbopumps for Liquid Rocket Engines |author=Joe Stangeland}}</ref>\n*[[J-2X]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pw.utc.com/J2X_Engine |title=J-2X Engine}}</ref>\n*[[F-1 (rocket engine)]]<ref name=\"F1\">{{cite web |url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/saturn_apollo/documents/F-1_Engine.pdf |title=F-1 Engine Fact Sheet }}</ref>\n*[[RD-107]]<ref name=\"rd107\">{{cite web |url=http://astronautix.com/engines/rd0107.htm |title=RD-107 |publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica}}</ref>\n*[[CE-20]]<ref name=\"ce\">{{cite conference |title=Structural Analysis of Propulsion System Components of an Indigenous Cryogenic Rocket Engine\n |author=Asraff, A and Muthukumar, R and Ramnathan, T and Balan, C\n |conference=44TH AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE JOINT PROPULSION CONFERENCE & EXHIBIT\n |year=2008\n |url=http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2008-5120 |doi=10.2514/6.2008-5120 }}</ref>\n\nRocket launch systems that use gas generator combustion engines:\n*[[Ariane 5]]<ref name=\"vulcain\"/>\n*[[Falcon 9]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spacex.com/falcon9.php |title=Falcon 9 Overview}}</ref> [[Falcon Heavy]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spacex.com/falcon_heavy.php |title=Falcon Heavy Overview}}</ref>\n*[[Delta IV]]<ref name=\"D4\"/>\n*[[Saturn V]]<ref name=\"F1\"/>\n*[[Soyuz (rocket family)]]\n*[[GSLV III|Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle III]]<ref name=\"ce\"/>\n*[[Long March 3B]], [[Long March 2F]]<ref>{{cite web |title= Advanced Rocket Engines |url= http://ftp.rta.nato.int/public/PubFullText/RTO/EN/RTO-EN-AVT-150/EN-AVT-150-06.pdf|publisher= Institute of Space Propulsion, German Aerospace Center (DLR) |date= }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Combustion tap-off cycle]]\n* [[Expander cycle (rocket)|Expander cycle]]\n* [[Pressure-fed engine (rocket)|Pressure-fed engine]]\n* [[Rocket engine]]\n* [[Staged combustion cycle (rocket)|Staged combustion cycle]]\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/winter2004/03_sidebar3.html Rocket power cycles]\n* [http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4404/ch2-6.htm Rocket-Engine Cooling] at NASA\n\n{{spacecraft propulsion}}\n{{Thermodynamic cycles}}\n\n[[Category:Combustion]]\n[[Category:Rocket engines]]\n[[Category:Rocket engines by cycle| ]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft propulsion]]\n[[Category:Thermodynamic cycles]]"}]}}}}
