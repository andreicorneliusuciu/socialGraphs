Liquids are desirable because their reasonably high density allows the volume of the propellant tanks to be relatively low, and it is possible to use lightweight centrifugal [[turbopump]]s to pump the propellant from the tanks into the combustion chamber, which means that the propellants can be kept under low pressure. This permits the use of low-mass propellant tanks, resulting in a high [[mass ratio]] for the rocket.\n\nAn inert gas stored in a tank at a high pressure is sometimes used instead of pumps in simpler small engines to force the propellants into the combustion chamber. These engines may have a lower mass ratio, but are usually more reliable.<ref name=\"Sutton\">{{cite book|last=Sutton|first=George P.|title=Rocket Propulsion Elements, 3rd edition|year=1963|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|page=25}}</ref>  {{rp|186,187}} and are therefore used widely in satellites for orbit maintenance.\n\nLiquid rockets can be [[monopropellant rocket]]s using a single type of propellant, [[bipropellant rocket]]s using two types of propellant, or more exotic [[tripropellant rocket]]s using three types of propellant.\nSome designs are [[Rocket engine throttling|throttleable]] for variable thrust operation and some may be restarted after a previous in-space shutdown.  Liquid propellants are also used in [[hybrid rocket]]s, in which a liquid oxidizer is generally combined with a solid fuel.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Goddard and Rocket.jpg|thumb|left|[[Robert H.

This seminal treatise on [[astronautics]] was published in 1903, but was not distributed outside  Russia until years later, and Russian scientists paid little attention to it.\n\nPedro Eleodoro Paulet Mostajo (July 2, 1874 \u2013 January 30, 1945) was a Peruvian scientist & inventor who allegedly in 1895 was the first person to build a liquid-fuel rocket engine and, in 1900, the first person to build a modern rocket propulsion system.[1] German V-2 inventor Wernher von Braun considered Paulet one of the \"fathers of aeronautics.\" The National Air & Space Museum in Washington, D.C., has a small plaque honoring the memory of Paulet.\nHe was the only known developer of liquid-propellant rocket engine experiments in the 19th century, considered one of the \"fathers of aeronautics.\".<ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?N=0&Ntk=DocumentID&Ntx=mode%20matchall&Ntt=19770026106 | title = The alleged contributions of Pedro E.

In 1927 he wrote a letter to a newspaper in [[Lima]], claiming he had experimented with a liquid rocket engine while he was a student in Paris three decades earlier. Historians of early rocketry experiments, among them [[Max Valier]], [[Willy Ley]], and [[John Drury Clark|John D. Clark]], have given differing amounts of credence to Paulet's report. Paulet described laboratory tests of, but did not claim to have launched a liquid rocket. \nWernher von Braun, in his book World History of Aeronautics states: \"Pedro Paulet was in Paris in those years (1900), experimenting with his tiny two-and-a-half kilogram motor, and achieved 100 kg of force. By this act, Paulet should be considered the pioneer of the liquid fuel propulsion motor.\" Further, in his History of Rocketry and Space Travel, von Braun recognizes that \"by his efforts, Paulet helped man reach the Moon.\"[3]\n\nThe first ''flight'' of a liquid-propellant rocket took place on March 16, 1926 at [[Auburn, Massachusetts]], when American professor Dr. [[Robert H. Goddard]] launched a vehicle using [[liquid oxygen]] and gasoline as propellants.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/news/2003/news-goddard.asp | title =  Re-Creating History | publisher = NASA}}</ref> The rocket, which was dubbed \"Nell\", rose just 41 feet during a 2.5-second flight that ended in a cabbage field, but it was an important demonstration that liquid-fueled rockets were possible. Goddard proposed liquid propellants about fifteen years earlier and began to seriously experiment with them in 1921.\n\nIn Germany, engineers and scientists became enthralled with liquid-fuel rockets, building and testing them in the early 1930s in [[Kummersdorf|a field]] near Berlin.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=n-MDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA716&dq=Popular+Mechanics+1931+curtiss&hl=en&ei=nOz1TKGlGoT48AbhovSDBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=true \"The World's First Rocket Airdrome\", May 1931, Popular Mechanics]</ref> This amateur rocket group, the [[Verein f\u00fcr Raumschiffahrt|VfR]], included [[Wernher von Braun]], who became the head of the army research station that secretly built the V-2 rocket weapon for the Nazis. The German-Romanian [[Hermann Oberth]] published a book in 1922 suggesting the use of liquid propellants.\n\n[[File:Heinkel He 176.svg|thumb|right|Drawing of the He 176 V1 prototype rocket aircraft]]\nBy the late 1930s, use of rocket propulsion for manned flight began to be seriously experimented with, as Germany's [[Heinkel He 176]] made the first manned rocket-powered flight using a liquid-fueled rocket engine, designed by German aeronautics engineer [[Hellmuth Walter]] on June 20, 1939.<ref>Volker Koos, ''Heinkel He 176 \u2013 Dichtung und Wahrheit,'' Jet&Prop 1/94 p. 17\u201321</ref>  The only production rocket-powered combat aircraft ever to see military service, the [[Messerschmitt Me 163|Me 163B]] ''Komet'' in 1944-45, also used a Walter-designed liquid-fueled rocket motor, the [[Walter HWK 109-509]], which produced up to 1,700 kgf (3,800&nbsp;lbs/f) thrust at full power.\n\nAfter World War II the American government and military finally seriously considered liquid-propellant rockets as weapons and began to fund work on them. The Soviet Union did likewise, and thus began the [[Space Race]].\n\n==Types==\n\nLiquid rockets have been built as [[monopropellant rocket]]s using a single type of propellant, [[bipropellant rocket]]s using two types of propellant, or more exotic [[tripropellant rocket]]s using three types of propellant.\n'''Bipropellant liquid rockets''' generally use a liquid [[fuel]], such as [[liquid hydrogen]] or a hydrocarbon fuel such as [[RP-1]], and a liquid [[oxidizer]], such as [[liquid oxygen]]. The engine may be a [[cryogenic rocket engine]], where the fuel and oxidizer, such as hydrogen and oxygen, are gases which have been liquefied at very low temperatures.\n\nLiquid-propellant rockets can be [[throttle]]d (thrust varied) in realtime, and have control of mixture ratio (ratio at which oxidizer and fuel are mixed); they can also be shut down, and, with a suitable ignition system or self-igniting propellant, restarted.\n\nLiquid propellants are also sometimes used in [[hybrid rocket]]s, in which a liquid oxidizer is combined with a solid fuel.<ref name=\"Sutton\"/> {{rp|354\u2013356}}\n\n==Principle of operation==\n\nAll liquid rocket engines have tankage and pipes to store and transfer propellant, an injector system, a combustion chamber which is very typically cylindrical, and one (sometimes two or more) [[rocket nozzle]]s. Liquid systems enable higher [[specific impulse]] than solids and hybrid rocket engines and can provide very high tankage efficiency.\n\nUnlike gases, a typical liquid propellant has a density similar to water, approximately 0.7\u20131.4g/cm\u00b3 (except [[liquid hydrogen]] which has a much lower density), while requiring only relatively modest [[saturated vapour pressure|pressure to prevent vapourisation]]. This combination of density and low pressure permits very lightweight tankage; approximately 1% of the contents for dense propellants and around 10% for liquid hydrogen (due to its low density and the mass of the required insulation).\n\nFor injection into the combustion chamber the propellant pressure at the injectors needs to be greater than the chamber pressure; this can be achieved with a pump. Suitable pumps usually use centrifugal [[turbopumps]] due to their high power and light weight, although [[reciprocating pump]]s have been employed in the past. Turbopumps are usually extremely lightweight and can give excellent performance; with an on-Earth weight well under 1% of the thrust. Indeed, overall [[rocket engine]] [[Thrust-to-weight ratio|thrust to weight ratio]]s including a turbopump have been as high as 155:1 with the SpaceX [[Merlin 1D]] rocket engine and up to 180:1 with the vacuum version <ref>[https://www.quora.com/Is-SpaceXs-Merlin-1Ds-thrust-to-weight-ratio-of-150+-believable/answer/thomas-mueller-11]</ref>\n\nAlternatively, instead of pumps, a heavy tank of a high-pressure inert gas such as helium can be used, and the pump forgone; but the [[delta-v]] that the stage can achieve is often much lower due to the extra mass of the tankage, reducing performance; but for high altitude or vacuum use the tankage mass can be acceptable.\n\nThe major components of a rocket engine are therefore the [[combustion chamber]] (thrust chamber), [[pyrotechnic igniter]], [[rocket propellant|propellant]] feed system, valves, regulators, the propellant tanks, and the [[rocket engine nozzle]]. In terms of feeding propellants to the combustion chamber, liquid-propellant engines are either [[Pressure-fed engine (rocket)|pressure-fed]] or [[Pump-fed engine|pump-fed]], and pump-fed engines work in either a [[gas-generator cycle (rocket)|gas-generator cycle]], a [[Staged combustion cycle (rocket)|staged-combustion cycle]], or an [[expander cycle]].\n\nA liquid rocket engine (LRE) can be tested prior to use, whereas for a solid rocket motor a rigorous [[quality management]] must be applied during manufacturing to ensure high reliability.<ref>[http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/~propulsi/propulsion/rockets/liquids.html NASA:Liquid rocket engines], 1998, Purdue University</ref> A LRE can also usually be reused for several flights, as in the [[Space Shuttle]] and [[Falcon 9]] series rockets.\n\n[[File:Space Shuttle Main Engine Maintenance - GPN-2000-000548.jpg|right|thumb|Bipropellant liquid rockets are simple in concept but due to high temperatures and high speed moving parts, very complex in practice.]]\nUse of liquid propellants can be associated with a number of issues:\n\n* Because the propellant is a very large proportion of the mass of the vehicle, the [[center of mass]] shifts significantly rearward as the propellant is used; one will typically lose control of the vehicle if its center mass gets too close to the center of drag.\n* When operated within an atmosphere, pressurization of the typically very thin-walled propellant tanks must guarantee positive [[gauge pressure]] at all times to avoid catastrophic collapse of the tank.\n* Liquid propellants are subject to ''[[slosh]]'', which has frequently led to loss of control of the vehicle. This can be controlled with slosh baffles in the tanks as well as judicious control laws in the [[guidance system]].\n* They can suffer from [[pogo oscillation]] where the rocket suffers from uncommanded cycles of acceleration.\n* Liquid propellants often need [[ullage motor]]s in zero-gravity or during staging to avoid sucking gas into engines at start up. They are also subject to vortexing within the tank, particularly towards the end of the burn, which can also result in gas being sucked into the engine or pump.\n* Liquid propellants can leak, especially [[hydrogen]], possibly leading to the formation of an explosive mixture.\n* [[Turbopumps]] to pump liquid propellants are complex to design, and can suffer serious failure modes, such as overspeeding if they run dry or shedding fragments at high speed if metal particles from the manufacturing process enter the pump.\n* [[Cryogenic propellant]]s, such as liquid oxygen, freeze atmospheric water vapour into ice. This can damage or block seals and valves and can cause leaks and other failures. Avoiding this problem often requires lengthy ''chilldown'' procedures which attempt to remove as much of the vapour from the system as possible. Ice can also form on the outside of the tank, and later fall and damage the vehicle. External foam insulation can cause issues as shown by the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]]. Non-cryogenic propellants do not cause such problems.\n* Non-storable liquid rockets require considerable preparation immediately before launch. This makes them less practical than [[solid rocket]]s for most weapon systems.\n\n==Propellants==\n{{main article|Liquid rocket propellant}}\nThousands of combinations of fuels and oxidizers have been tried over the years. Some of the more common and practical ones are:\n\n===Cryogenic===\n\n* Liquid oxygen ([[LOX]], O<sub>2</sub>) and liquid [[hydrogen]] ([[LH2]], H<sub>2</sub>) \u2013 [[Space Shuttle]] main engines, [[Ariane 5]] main stage and the Ariane 5 ECA second stage, the [[BE-3]] of Blue Origin's New Shepard, the first and second stage of the [[Delta IV rocket|Delta IV]], the upper stages of the [[Ares I]], [[Saturn V (rocket)|Saturn V]]'s [[S-II|second]] and [[S-IVB|third stages]], [[Saturn IB (rocket)|Saturn IB]], and [[Saturn I (rocket)|Saturn I]] as well as [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] rocket stage, the first stage and second stage of the [[H-II]], [[H-IIA]], [[H-IIB]], and the upper stage of the [[GSLV]].\n* Liquid oxygen (LOX) and [[Liquid methane rocket fuel|liquid methane]] (CH<sub>4</sub>) \u2013 the in-development [[Raptor (rocket engine)|Raptor]] (SpaceX) and [[BE-4]] (Blue Origin) engines\n\n===Semi-cryogenic===\n\n* Liquid oxygen (LOX) and [[kerosene]] or [[RP-1]] \u2013 [[Saturn V (rocket)|Saturn V]]'s [[S-IC|first stage]], [[Zenit rocket]], [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]]-derived vehicles including [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz]], [[Delta rocket|Delta]], [[Saturn I (rocket)|Saturn I]], and [[Saturn IB (rocket)|Saturn IB]] first stages, [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan I]] and [[Atlas rocket]]s, [[Falcon 1]] and [[Falcon 9]]\n* Liquid oxygen (LOX) and alcohol ([[ethanol]], C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH) \u2013 early liquid-fueled rockets, like [[Germany|German]] ([[World War II]]) A4, aka [[V-2]], and [[Redstone (rocket)|Redstone]]\n* Liquid oxygen (LOX) and [[gasoline]] \u2013 [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]]'s first liquid-fuel rocket\n* Liquid oxygen (LOX) and [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) \u2013 proposed for a Mars ''hopper'' vehicle (with a specific impulse of approximately 250 s), principally because carbon monoxide and oxygen can be straightforwardly produced by [[Zirconia]] electrolysis from the Martian atmosphere without requiring use of any of the Martian water resources to obtain Hydrogen.<ref name=\"landis2001\">{{cite journal |last=Landis |title=Mars Rocket Vehicle Using In Situ Propellants |journal=Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets |date=2001 |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=730\u2013735 |doi=10.2514/2.3739 |url=http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/2.3739?journalCode=jsr }}</ref>\n\n===[[Hypergolic propellant|Hypergolic]]===\n[[File:Messerschmitt Me 163B USAF.jpg|thumb|left| The [[NMUSAF]]'s Me 163B ''Komet'']]\n[[File:Soyuz TMA-13 erected at Baikonur Cosmodrome launch pad.jpg|thumb|Soyuz TMA-13 erected at Baikonur Cosmodrome launch pad]]\n* [[T-Stoff]] (80% hydrogen peroxide, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as the oxidizer) and [[C-Stoff]] (methanol, CH<sub>3</sub>OH, and hydrazine hydrate, N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>\u2022''n''(H<sub>2</sub>O) as the fuel) \u2013 used for the Hellmuth-Walter-Werke [[HWK 109-509]]A, -B and -C engine family used on the [[Messerschmitt Me 163]]B Komet, an operational rocket fighter plane of [[World War II]], and [[Bachem Ba 349|Ba 349 ''Natter'']] manned [[Takeoff#Vertical takeoff|VTO]] interceptor prototypes.\n* [[Nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>) and kerosene \u2013 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Bereznyak-Isayev BI-1|BI-1]] and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich I-270|MiG I-270]] rocket fighter prototypes, [[Scud]]-A, aka [[SS-1]] [[SRBM]]\n* Inhibited red fuming nitric acid (I[[RFNA]], HNO<sub>3</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) and unsymmetric dimethyl hydrazine ([[UDMH]], (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>) \u2013 Soviet [[Scud]]-C, aka [[SS-1]]-c,-d,-e\n* Nitric acid 73% with [[dinitrogen tetroxide]] 27% (AK27) and kerosene/gasoline mixture (TM-185) \u2013 various Russian (USSR) cold-war ballistic missiles ([[R-12 Dvina|R-12]], [[Scud]]-B,-D), [[Iran]]: [[Shahab-5]], [[North Korea]]: [[Taepodong-2]]\n* [[High-test peroxide]] (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and kerosene \u2013 [[United Kingdom|UK]] (1970s) [[Black Arrow]], [[United States|USA]] Development (or study): BA-3200\n* [[Hydrazine]] (N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) and red fuming nitric acid \u2013 Nike Ajax Antiaircraft Rocket\n* Unsymmetric dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and dinitrogen tetroxide (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) \u2013 [[Proton rocket|Proton]], [[Rokot]], [[Long March 2 (rocket family)|Long March 2]] (used to launch [[Shenzhou (spacecraft)|Shenzhou]] crew vehicles\n* [[Aerozine 50]] (50% UDMH, 50% hydrazine) and dinitrogen tetroxide (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) \u2013 [[Titan (rocket family)|Titans 2\u20134]], Apollo [[lunar module]], Apollo [[service module]], interplanatary probes (Such as [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2]])\n* [[Monomethylhydrazine]] (MMH, (CH<sub>3</sub>)HN<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>) and dinitrogen tetroxide (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) \u2013 [[Space Shuttle orbiter]]'s [[Orbital maneuvering system]] (OMS) engines and [[Reaction control system]] (RCS) thrusters. [[SpaceX]]'s [[Draco (rocket engine)|Draco]] and SuperDraco engines for the [[Dragon spacecraft]].\n\nOne of the most efficient mixtures, [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]], suffers from the extremely low temperatures required for storing liquid hydrogen (around 20 K or \u2212253&nbsp;\u00b0C) and very low fuel density (70&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3, compared to RP-1 at 820&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3), necessitating large tanks that must also be lightweight and insulating. Lightweight foam insulation on the [[Space Shuttle external tank]] led to the [[Space Shuttle Columbia]]'s [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|destruction]], as a piece broke loose, damaged its wing and caused it to break up on [[atmospheric reentry]].\n\nFor [[storable propellant|storable]] [[ICBM]]s and most spacecraft, including crewed vehicles, planetary probes, and satellites, storing cryogenic propellants over extended periods is unfeasible. Because of this, mixtures of [[hydrazine]] or its derivatives in combination with nitrogen oxides are generally used for such applications, but are toxic and [[carcinogenic]]. Consequently, to improve handling, some crew vehicles such as [[Dream Chaser]] and [[Space Ship Two]] plan to use [[hybrid rocket]]s with non-toxic fuel and oxidizer combinations.\n\n==Injectors==\nThe injector implementation in liquid rockets determines the percentage of the theoretical performance of the [[Rocket engine nozzle|nozzle]] that can be achieved. A poor injector performance causes unburnt propellant to leave the engine, giving extremely poor efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, injectors are also usually key in reducing thermal loads on the nozzle; by increasing the proportion of fuel around the edge of the chamber, this gives much lower temperatures on the walls of the nozzle.\n\n===Types of injectors===\nInjectors can be as simple as a number of small diameter holes arranged in carefully constructed patterns through which the fuel and oxidiser travel. The speed of the flow is determined by the square root of the pressure drop across the injectors, the shape of the hole and other details such as the density of the propellant.\n\nThe first injectors used on the V-2 created parallel jets of fuel and oxidizer which then combusted in the chamber. This gave quite poor efficiency.\n\nInjectors today classically consist of a number of small holes which aim jets of fuel and oxidiser so that they collide at a point in space a short distance away from the injector plate. This helps to break the flow up into small droplets that burn more easily.\n\nThe main types of injectors are\n* Shower head\n* Self-impinging doublet\n* Cross-impinging triplet\n* Centripetal or swirling\n* [[pintle injector|Pintle]]\n\nThe pintle injector permits good mixture control of fuel and oxidizer over a wide range of flow rates. The pintle injector was used on the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] engines ''See [[Descent Propulsion System]]'' and the current [[Merlin (rocket engine)|Merlin]] and [[Kestrel (rocket engine)|Kestrel]] engines designed by [[SpaceX]] and used on [[Falcon 9]] and planned [[Falcon Heavy]] rockets.\n\nThe [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]] uses a system of fluted posts, which use heated hydrogen from the preburner to vaporize the liquid oxygen flowing through the center of the posts<ref>Sutton, George P. and Biblarz, Oscar, ''Rocket Propulsion Elements'', 7th ed., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 2001.</ref> and this improves the rate and stability of the combustion process; previous engines such as the F-1 used for the [[Apollo program]] had significant issues with oscillations that led to destruction of the engines, but this was not a problem in the SSME due to this design detail.\n\n[[Valentin Glushko]] invented the centripetal injector in the early 1930s, and it has been almost universally used in Russian engines. Rotational motion is applied to the liquid (and sometimes the two propellants are mixed), then it is expelled through a small hole, where it forms a cone-shaped sheet that rapidly atomizes.  Goddard's first liquid-fuel engine used a single impinging injector.  German scientists in WWII experimented with impinging injectors on flat plates, used successfully in the Wasserfall missile.\n\n===Combustion stability===\n\nTo avoid instabilities such as ''chugging'' which is a relatively low speed oscillation the engine must be designed with enough pressure drop across the injectors to render the flow largely independent of the chamber pressure. This is normally achieved by using at least 20% of the chamber pressure across the injectors.\n\nNevertheless, particularly in larger engines, a high speed combustion oscillation is  easily triggered, and these are not well understood. These high speed oscillations tend to disrupt the gas side boundary layer of the engine, and this can cause the cooling system to rapidly fail, destroying the engine. These kinds of oscillations are much more common on large engines, and plagued the development of the [[Saturn V]], but were finally overcome.\n\nSome combustion chambers, such as those of the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|SSME]], use [[Helmholtz resonator]]s as damping mechanisms to stop particular resonant frequencies from growing.\n\nTo prevent these issues the SSME injector design instead went to a lot of effort to vapourise the propellant prior to injection into the combustion chamber. Although many other features were used to ensure that instabilities could not occur, later research showed that these other features were unnecessary, and the gas phase combustion worked reliably.\n\nTesting for stability often involves the use of small explosives. These are detonated within the chamber during operation, and causes an impulsive excitation. By examining the pressure trace of the chamber to determine how quickly the effects of the disturbance die away, it is possible to estimate the stability and redesign features of the chamber if required.\n\n==Engine cycles==\nFor liquid-propellant rockets four different ways of powering the injection of the propellant into the chamber are in common use.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/winter2004/03_sidebar3.html|title= Sometimes, Smaller is Better}}</ref>\n\nFuel and oxidizer must be pumped into the combustion chamber against the pressure of the hot gasses being burned, and engine power is limited by the rate at which propellant that can be pumped into the combustion chamber. For atmospheric or launcher use, high pressure, and thus high power, engine cycles are desirable to minimize [[gravity drag]]. For orbital use, lower power cycles are usually fine.\n\n;[[Pressure-fed cycle (rocket)|Pressure-fed cycle]]: The propellants are forced in from pressurised (relatively heavy) tanks. The heavy tanks mean that a relatively low pressure is optimal, limiting engine power, but all the fuel is burned, allowing high efficiency. The pressurant used is frequently helium due to its lack of reactivity and low density. Examples: [[AJ-10]], used in the Space Shuttle [[Orbital Maneuvering System|OMS]], Apollo [[Service Propulsion System|SPS]], and the second stage of the [[Delta II]].\n;[[Electric pump-fed engine|Electric pump-fed]]: It uses an [[electric motor]], generally a [[brushless DC electric motor]], to drive the [[pump]]s. The electric motor is powered by a battery pack. It is relatively simple to implement and avoids all the complexities of using [[turbomachinery]], but at the expense of the extra dry mass of the battery pack. Example engine is the [[Rutherford (rocket engine)|Rutherford]].\n;[[Gas-generator cycle (rocket)|Gas-generator cycle]]: A small percentage of the propellants are burnt in a preburner to power a turbopump and then exhausted through a separate nozzle, or low down on the main one. This results in a reduction in efficiency since the exhaust contributes little or no thrust, but the pump turbines can be very large, allowing for high power engines. Examples: [[Saturn V]]'s [[F-1 engine|F-1]] and [[J-2 engine|J-2]], [[Delta IV]]'s [[RS-68]], [[Ariane 5]]'s [[HM7B]], [[Falcon 9 v1.1|Falcon 9]]'s [[Merlin 1D|Merlin]].\n;[[Tap-off cycle]]: Takes hot gases from the main [[combustion chamber]] of the rocket engine and routes them through engine [[turbopump]] turbines to pump fuel, then is exhausted. Since not all fuel flows through the main combustion chamber, the tap-off cycle is considered an open-cycle engine. Examples include the [[J-2S]] and [[BE-3]].\n;[[Expander cycle]]: Cryogenic fuel (hydrogen, or methane) is used to cool the walls of the combustion chamber and nozzle. Absorbed heat vaporizes and expands the fuel which is then used to drive the turbopumps before it enters the combustion chamber, allowing for high efficiency, or is bled overboard, allowing for higher power turbopumps. The limited heat available to vaporize the fuel constrains engine power. Examples: [[RL-10]] for [[Atlas V]] and Delta IV second stages (closed cycle), [[H-II]]'s [[LE-5]] (bleed cycle).\n;[[Staged combustion cycle (rocket)|Staged combustion cycle]]: A fuel- or oxidizer-rich mixture is burned in a turbine to power the turbopumps, and this high-pressure exhaust is fed directly into the main chamber where the remainder of the fuel or oxidizer undergoes combustion, permitting very high pressures and efficiency. Examples: [[SSME]], [[RD-191]], [[LE-7]].\n\n===Engine cycle tradeoffs===\nSelecting an engine cycle is one of the earlier steps to rocket engine design.  A number of tradeoffs arise from this selection, some of which include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Tradeoff comparison among popular engine cycles\n|-\n! rowspan=2 |\n! colspan=4 | Cycle type\n|-\n!

This reduces the temperature there, and downstream to the throat and even into the nozzle and permits the combustion chamber to be run at higher pressure, which permits a higher expansion ratio nozzle to be used which gives a higher ''I{{sub|SP}}'' and better system performance.<ref>Rocket Propulsion elements - Sutton Biblarz, section 8.1</ref> A liquid rocket engine often employs [[regenerative cooling]], which uses the fuel or less commonly the oxidiser to cool the chamber and nozzle.\n\n==Ignition==\nIgnition can be performed in many ways, but perhaps more so with liquid propellants than other rockets a consistent and significant ignitions source is required; a delay of ignition (in some cases as small as) a few tens of milliseconds can cause overpressure of the chamber due to excess propellant. A [[hard start]] can even cause an engine to explode.\n\nGenerally, ignition systems try to apply flames across the injector surface, with a mass flow of approximately 1% of the full mass flow of the chamber.\n\nSafety interlocks are sometimes used to ensure the presence of an ignition source before the main valves open; however reliability of the interlocks can in some cases be lower than the ignition system. Thus it depends on whether the system must fail safe, or whether overall mission success is more important. Interlocks are rarely used for upper, unmanned stages where failure of the interlock would cause loss of mission, but are present on the SSME, to shut the engines down prior to liftoff of the Space Shuttle. In addition, detection of successful ignition of the igniter is surprisingly difficult, some systems use thin wires that are cut by the flames, pressure sensors have also seen some use.\n\nMethods of ignition include pyrotechnic, electrical (spark or hot wire), and chemical.  [[Hypergolic]] propellants have the advantage of self igniting, reliably and with less chance of hard starts.  In the 1940s, the Russians began to start engines with hypergolic fuel, then switch over to the primary propellants after ignition. This was also used on the American [[F-1 rocket engine]] on the [[Apollo program]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison of orbital launch systems]]\n* [[Comparison of orbital launchers families]]\n* [[Comparison of orbital rocket engines]]\n* [[Comparison of solid-fuelled orbital launch systems]]\n* [[List of space launch system designs]]\n* [[List of missiles]]\n* [[List of orbital launch systems]]\n* [[List of sounding rockets]]\n* [[List of military rockets]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.risacher.org/rocket/ An online book entitled ''\u201dHow to Design, Build, and Test Small Liquid-Fuel Rocket Engines\u201d'']\n* [http://www.erichwarsitz.com The Heinkel He 176, worlds's first liquid-fuel rocket aircraft]\n\n{{Spacecraft propulsion}}\n{{Rocket engines}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Liquid-Propellant Rocket}}\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Rocket propulsion]]\n[[Category:Rocket engines by propellant]]"}]}}}}
