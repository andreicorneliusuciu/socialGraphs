The behavior of these quantities is governed by the four [[laws of thermodynamics]], irrespective of the composition or specific properties of the material or system in question.  The laws of thermodynamics are explained in terms of microscopic constituents by [[statistical mechanics]].  Thermodynamics applies to a wide variety of topics in [[science]] and [[engineering]], especially [[physical chemistry]], [[chemical engineering]] and [[mechanical engineering]].\n\nHistorically, thermodynamics developed out of a desire to increase the [[thermodynamic efficiency|efficiency]] of early [[steam engine]]s, particularly through the work of French physicist [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot]] (1824) who believed that engine efficiency was the key that could help France win the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Clausius | first = Rudolf | title = On the Motive Power of Heat, and on the Laws which can be deduced from it for the Theory of Heat | publisher = Poggendorff's ''Annalen der Physik'', LXXIX (Dover Reprint) | year = 1850 | isbn = 0-486-59065-8}}</ref> Scottish physicist [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] was the first to formulate a concise definition of thermodynamics in 1854:<ref name=kelvin1854>{{cite book\n|title=Mathematical and Physical Papers\n|author= William Thomson, LL.D.

[[Statistical thermodynamics]], or statistical mechanics, concerned itself with [[statistics|statistical]] predictions of the collective motion of particles from their microscopic behavior. In 1909, [[Constantin Carath\u00e9odory]] presented a purely mathematical approach to the field in his axiomatic formulation of thermodynamics, a description often referred to as ''geometrical thermodynamics''.\n\n==Introduction==\nThe starting point for most considerations of thermodynamic systems are the [[laws of thermodynamics]], four principles that form an axiomatic basis. The first law specifies that energy can be exchanged between physical systems as [[heat]] and [[Mechanical work|work]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Van Ness, H.C. | title=Understanding Thermodynamics | publisher=Dover Publications, Inc. | year=1983 | origyear=1969 | isbn=9780486632773 | oclc=8846081}}</ref> The second law defines the existence of the quantity [[entropy]], a quantification of the state of order of a system that expresses the notion of useful work that can be performed.<ref>{{cite book | author=Dugdale, J.S. | title=Entropy and its Physical Meaning | publisher=Taylor and Francis | year=1998 | isbn=0-7484-0569-0 | oclc=36457809}}</ref>\n\nIn thermodynamics, interactions between large ensembles of objects are studied and categorized. Central to this are the concepts of ''[[System (thermodynamics)|system]]'' and ''[[Surroundings (thermodynamics)|surroundings]]''. A system is composed of particles, whose average motions define its properties, which in turn are related to one another through [[Equation of state|equations of state]]. Properties can be combined to express [[internal energy]] and [[thermodynamic potentials]], which are useful for determining conditions for [[Dynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] and [[spontaneous process]]es.\n\nWith these tools, thermodynamics can be used to describe how systems respond to changes in their environment. This can be applied to a wide variety of topics in [[science]] and [[engineering]], such as [[engine]]s, [[phase transition]]s, [[chemical reaction]]s, [[transport phenomena]], and even [[black hole]]s. The results of thermodynamics are essential for other fields of [[physics]] and for [[chemistry]], [[chemical engineering]], [[aerospace engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[cell biology]], [[biomedical engineering]], [[materials science]], and [[economics]], to name a few.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Smith | first1=J.M. | last2=Van Ness | first2=H.C. | last3=Abbott | first3=M.M. | title=Introduction to Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics | publisher=McGraw Hill | year=2005 | isbn=0-07-310445-0 | oclc=56491111}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Haynie, Donald, T. | title=Biological Thermodynamics | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2001 | isbn=0-521-79549-4 | oclc=43993556}}</ref>\n\nThis article is focused mainly on classical thermodynamics which primarily studies systems in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics]] is often treated as an extension of the classical treatment, but statistical mechanics has brought many advances of the field.\n\n[[File:Eight founding schools.png|400px|thumb|The [[thermodynamicist]]s representative of the original eight founding schools of thermodynamics. The schools with the most-lasting effect in founding the modern versions of thermodynamics are the Berlin school, particularly as established in [[Rudolf Clausius]]\u2019s 1865 textbook ''The Mechanical Theory of Heat'', the Vienna school, with the [[statistical mechanics]] of [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], and the Gibbsian school at Yale University, American engineer [[Willard Gibbs]]' 1876 ''[[On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances]]'' launching [[chemical thermodynamics]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.eoht.info/page/Schools+of+thermodynamics Schools of thermodynamics] - EoHT.info.</ref>]]\n\n==History==\nThe [[history of thermodynamics]] as a scientific discipline generally begins with [[Otto von Guericke]] who, in 1650, built and designed the world's first [[vacuum pump]] and demonstrated a [[vacuum]] using his [[Magdeburg hemispheres]].  Guericke was driven to make a vacuum in order to disprove [[Aristotle]]'s long-held supposition that 'nature abhors a vacuum'. Shortly after Guericke, the English physicist and chemist [[Robert Boyle]] had learned of Guericke's designs and, in 1656, in coordination with English scientist [[Robert Hooke]], built an air pump.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[J. R. Partington|Partington, J.R.]] | title=A Short History of Chemistry | publisher=Dover | year=1989 | isbn= | oclc=19353301}}</ref> Using this pump, Boyle and Hooke noticed a correlation between [[pressure]], [[temperature]], and [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]].  In time, [[Boyle's Law]] was formulated, which states that pressure and volume are [[inverse proportion|inversely proportional]].  Then, in 1679, based on these concepts, an associate of Boyle's named [[Denis Papin]] built a [[steam digester]], which was a closed vessel with a tightly fitting lid that confined steam until a high pressure was generated.\n\nLater designs implemented a steam release valve that kept the machine from exploding.  By watching the valve rhythmically move up and down, Papin conceived of the idea of a piston and a cylinder engine.  He did not, however, follow through with his design. Nevertheless, in 1697, based on Papin's designs, engineer [[Thomas Savery]] built the first engine, followed by [[Thomas Newcomen]] in 1712. Although these early engines were crude and inefficient, they attracted the attention of the leading scientists of the time.\n\nThe fundamental concepts of [[heat capacity]] and [[latent heat]], which were necessary for the development of thermodynamics, were developed by Professor [[Joseph Black]] at the University of Glasgow, where [[James Watt]] was employed as an instrument maker.  Black and Watt performed experiments together, but it was Watt who conceived the idea of the [[Watt steam engine#Separate condenser|external condenser]] which resulted in a large increase in [[steam engine]] efficiency.<ref>The Newcomen engine was improved from 1711 until Watt's work, making the efficiency comparison subject to qualification, but the increase from the 1865 version was on the order of 100%.</ref>  Drawing on all the previous work led [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], the \"father of thermodynamics\", to publish ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'' (1824), a discourse on heat, power, energy and engine efficiency.  The paper outlined the basic energetic relations between the [[Carnot engine]], the [[Carnot cycle]], and [[motive power]].  It marked the start of thermodynamics as a modern science.<ref name=\"Perrot\" />\n\nThe first thermodynamic textbook was written in 1859 by [[William John Macquorn Rankine|William Rankine]], originally trained as a physicist and a civil and mechanical engineering professor at the [[University of Glasgow]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Cengel, Yunus A. |author2=Boles, Michael A. | title=Thermodynamics - an Engineering Approach | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2005 | isbn=0-07-310768-9}}</ref> The first and second laws of thermodynamics emerged simultaneously in the 1850s, primarily out of the works of [[William John Macquorn Rankine|William Rankine]], [[Rudolf Clausius]], and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (Lord Kelvin).\n\nThe foundations of statistical thermodynamics were set out by physicists such as [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], [[Max Planck]], [[Rudolf Clausius]] and [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J.

It is used to model exchanges of energy, work and heat based on the [[laws of thermodynamics]]. The qualifier ''classical'' reflects the fact that it represents the descriptive level in terms of macroscopic empirical parameters that can be measured in the laboratory, that was the first level of understanding in the 19th century. A microscopic interpretation of these concepts was provided by the development of statistical mechanics.\n\n===Statistical mechanics===\n[[Statistical mechanics]], also called statistical thermodynamics, emerged with the development of atomic and molecular theories in the late 19th century and early 20th century, supplementing thermodynamics with an interpretation of the microscopic interactions between individual particles or quantum-mechanical states.  This field relates the microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the macroscopic, bulk properties of materials that can be observed on the human scale, thereby explaining thermodynamics as a natural result of statistics, classical mechanics, and quantum theory at the microscopic level.\n\n===Chemical thermodynamics===\n[[Chemical thermodynamics]] is the study of the interrelation of [[energy]] with [[chemical reactions]] or with a physical change of [[thermodynamic state|state]] within the confines of the [[laws of thermodynamics]].\n\n===Treatment of equilibrium===\n[[Equilibrium thermodynamics]] is the systematic study of transformations of matter and energy in systems as they approach equilibrium. The word equilibrium implies a state of balance. In an equilibrium state there are no unbalanced potentials, or driving forces, within the system. A central aim in equilibrium thermodynamics is: given a system in a well-defined initial state, subject to accurately specified constraints, to calculate what the state of the system will be once it has reached equilibrium.\n\n[[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics]] is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. Most systems found in nature are not in thermodynamic equilibrium because they are not in stationary states, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems. The thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by equilibrium thermodynamics. Many natural systems still today remain beyond the scope of currently known macroscopic thermodynamic methods.\n\n==Laws of thermodynamics==\n{{Main|Laws of thermodynamics}}\nThermodynamics is principally based on a set of four laws which are universally valid when applied to systems that fall within the constraints implied by each. In the various theoretical descriptions of thermodynamics these laws may be expressed in seemingly differing forms, but the most prominent formulations are the following:\n\n*[[Zeroth law of thermodynamics]]: ''If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.''\n\nThis statement implies that thermal equilibrium is an [[equivalence relation]] on the set of [[thermodynamic system]]s under consideration. Systems are said to be in equilibrium if the small, random exchanges between them (e.g. [[Brownian motion]]) do not lead to a net change in energy. This law is tacitly assumed in every measurement of temperature. Thus, if one seeks to decide if two bodies are at the same [[temperature]], it is not necessary to bring them into contact and measure any changes of their observable properties in time.<ref>Moran, Michael J. and Howard N. Shapiro, 2008. ''Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics''. 6th ed. Wiley and Sons: 16.</ref> The law provides an empirical definition of temperature and justification for the construction of practical thermometers.\n\nThe zeroth law was not initially recognized as a law, as its basis in thermodynamical equilibrium was implied in the other laws.  The first, second, and third laws had been explicitly stated prior and found common acceptance in the physics community. Once the importance of the zeroth law for the definition of temperature was realized, it was impracticable to renumber the other laws, hence it was numbered the ''zeroth law''.\n\n*[[First law of thermodynamics]]: ''The internal energy of an isolated system is constant.''\n\nThe first law of thermodynamics is an expression of the principle of [[conservation of energy]]. It states that energy can be transformed (changed from one form to another), but cannot be created or destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uwsp.edu/cnr/wcee/keep/mod1/rules/ThermoLaws.htm | title=Energy Rules! Energy Conversion and the Laws of Thermodynamics - More About the First and Second Laws |publisher=Uwsp.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>\n\nThe first law is usually formulated by saying that the change in the [[internal energy]] of a closed [[thermodynamic system]] is equal to the difference between the [[heat]] supplied to the system and the amount of [[thermodynamic work|work]] done by the system on its surroundings. It is important to note that internal energy is a state of the system (see [[Thermodynamic state]]) whereas heat and work modify the state of the system. In other words, a specific internal energy of a system may be achieved by any combination of heat and work; the manner by which a system achieves a specific internal energy is path independent.\n\n*[[Second law of thermodynamics]]: ''Heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder location to a hotter location.''\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics is an expression of the universal principle of decay observable in nature. The second law is an observation of the fact that over time, differences in temperature, pressure, and chemical potential tend to even out in a physical system that is isolated from the outside world. [[Entropy]] is a measure of how much this process has progressed. The entropy of an isolated system which is not in equilibrium will tend to increase over time, approaching a maximum value at equilibrium.\n\nIn classical thermodynamics, the second law is a basic postulate applicable to any system involving heat energy transfer; in statistical thermodynamics, the second law is a consequence of the assumed randomness of molecular chaos. There are many versions of the second law, but they all have the same effect, which is to explain the phenomenon of [[irreversibility]] in nature.\n\n*[[Third law of thermodynamics]]: ''As a system approaches absolute zero, all processes cease and the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value.''\n\nThe third law of thermodynamics is a statistical law of nature regarding entropy and the impossibility of reaching [[absolute zero]] of temperature.  This law provides an absolute reference point for the determination of entropy. The entropy determined relative to this point is the absolute entropy. Alternate definitions are, \"the entropy of all systems and of all states of a system is smallest at absolute zero,\" or equivalently \"it is impossible to reach the absolute zero of temperature by any finite number of processes\".\n\nAbsolute zero, at which all activity would stop if it were possible to happen, is \u2212273.15&nbsp;\u00b0C (degrees Celsius), or \u2212459.67&nbsp;\u00b0F (degrees Fahrenheit) or 0 K (kelvin).\n\n==System models==\n[[File:system boundary.svg|200px|thumb|right|A diagram of a generic thermodynamic system]]\nAn important concept in thermodynamics is the [[thermodynamic system]], a precisely defined region of the universe under study. Everything in the universe except the system is known as the [[Environment (systems)|''surroundings'']]. A system is separated from the remainder of the universe by a [[Boundary (thermodynamic)|''boundary'']] which may be notional or not, but which by convention delimits a finite volume. Exchanges of [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], [[heat]], or [[matter]] between the system and the surroundings take place across this boundary.\n\nIn practice, the boundary is simply an imaginary dotted line drawn around a volume when there is going to be a change in the [[internal energy]] of that volume.  Anything that passes across the boundary that affects a change in the internal energy needs to be accounted for in the energy balance equation.  The volume can be the region surrounding a single atom resonating energy, such as [[Max Planck]] defined in 1900; it can be a body of steam or air in a [[steam engine]], such as [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] defined in 1824; it can be the body of a [[tropical cyclone]], such as [[Kerry Emanuel]] theorized in 1986 in the field of [[atmospheric thermodynamics]]; it could also be just one [[nuclide]] (i.e. a system of [[quark]]s) as hypothesized in [[quantum thermodynamics]].\n\nBoundaries are of four types: fixed, moveable, real, and imaginary. For example, in an engine, a fixed boundary means the piston is locked at its position; as such, a constant volume process occurs. In that same engine, a moveable boundary allows the piston to move in and out.  For closed systems, boundaries are real while for open system boundaries are often imaginary.\n\nGenerally, thermodynamics distinguishes three classes of systems, defined in terms of what is allowed to cross their boundaries:\n{{table of thermodynamic systems}}\nAs time passes in an isolated system, internal differences in the system tend to even out and pressures and temperatures tend to equalize, as do density differences. A system in which all equalizing processes have gone to completion is considered to be in a [[state (thermodynamic)|state]] of [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].\n\nIn thermodynamic equilibrium, a system's properties are, by definition, unchanging in time. Systems in equilibrium are much simpler and easier to understand than systems which are not in equilibrium. Often, when analysing a thermodynamic process, it can be assumed that each intermediate state in the process is at equilibrium. This will also considerably simplify the situation. Thermodynamic processes which develop so slowly as to allow each intermediate step to be an equilibrium state are said to be [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible processes]].\n\n==States and processes==\nWhen a system is at equilibrium under a given set of conditions, it is said to be in a definite [[thermodynamic state]]. The state of the system can be described by a number of [[state function|state quantities]] that do not depend on the process by which the system arrived at its state. They are called [[intensive variable]]s or [[extensive variable]]s according to how they change when the size of the system changes.  The properties of the system can be described by an [[equation of state]] which specifies the relationship between these variables.  State may be thought of as the instantaneous quantitative description of a system with a set number of variables held constant.\n\nA [[thermodynamic process]] may be defined as the energetic evolution of a thermodynamic system proceeding from an initial state to a final state. It can be described by [[process function|process quantities]]. Typically, each thermodynamic process is distinguished from other processes in energetic character according to what parameters, such as temperature, pressure, or volume, etc., are held fixed.  Furthermore, it is useful to group these processes into pairs, in which each variable held constant is one member of a [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate]] pair.\n\nSeveral commonly studied thermodynamic processes are:\n\n*[[Isobaric process]]: occurs at constant [[pressure]]\n*[[Isochoric process]]: occurs at constant [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] (also called isometric/isovolumetric)\n*[[Isothermal process]]: occurs at a constant [[temperature]]\n*[[Adiabatic process]]: occurs without loss or gain of energy by [[heat]]\n*[[Isentropic process]]: a reversible adiabatic process, occurs at a constant [[entropy]]\n*[[Isenthalpic process]]: occurs at a constant [[enthalpy]]\n*[[steady state|Steady state process]]: occurs without a change in the [[internal energy]]\n\n== Instrumentation ==\nThere are two types of [[thermodynamic instruments]], the '''meter''' and the '''reservoir'''. A thermodynamic meter is any device which measures any parameter of a [[thermodynamic system]]. In some cases, the thermodynamic parameter is actually defined in terms of an idealized measuring instrument. For example, the [[zeroth law of thermodynamics|zeroth law]] states that if two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with a third body, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other. This principle, as noted by [[James Clerk Maxwell|James Maxwell]] in 1872, asserts that it is possible to measure temperature. An idealized [[thermometer]] is a sample of an ideal gas at constant pressure. From the [[ideal gas law]] ''pV=nRT'', the volume of such a sample can be used as an indicator of temperature; in this manner it defines temperature. Although pressure is defined mechanically, a pressure-measuring device, called a [[barometer]] may also be constructed from a sample of an ideal gas held at a constant temperature. A [[calorimeter]] is a device which is used to measure and define the internal energy of a system.\n\nA thermodynamic reservoir is a system which is so large that it does not appreciably alter its state parameters when brought into contact with the test system. It is used to impose a particular value of a state parameter upon the system. For example, a pressure reservoir is a system at a particular pressure, which imposes that pressure upon any test system that it is mechanically connected to. The Earth's atmosphere is often used as a pressure reservoir.\n\n== Conjugate variables ==\n{{Main|Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|l1=Conjugate variables}}\n\nThe central concept of thermodynamics is that of [[energy]], the ability to do [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]]. By the [[first law of thermodynamics|First Law]], the total energy of a system and its surroundings is conserved. Energy may be transferred into a system by heating, compression, or addition of matter, and extracted from a system by cooling, expansion, or extraction of matter. In [[mechanics]], for example, energy transfer equals the product of the force applied to a body and the resulting displacement.\n\n[[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|Conjugate variables]] are pairs of thermodynamic concepts, with the first being akin to a \"force\" applied to some [[thermodynamic system]], the second being akin to the resulting \"displacement,\" and the product of the two equalling the amount of energy transferred. The common conjugate variables are:\n*[[Pressure]]-[[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] (the [[Mechanics|mechanical]] parameters);\n*[[Temperature]]-[[entropy]] (thermal parameters);\n*[[Chemical potential]]-[[particle number]] (material parameters).\n\n== Potentials ==\n[[Thermodynamic potential]]s are different quantitative measures of the stored energy in a system. Potentials are used to measure energy changes in systems as they evolve from an initial state to a final state.  The potential used depends on the constraints of the system, such as constant temperature or pressure.  For example, the Helmholtz and Gibbs energies are the energies available in a system to do useful work when the temperature and volume or the pressure and temperature are fixed, respectively.\n\nThe five most well known potentials are:\n{{table of thermodynamic potentials}}\n\nwhere <math>T</math> is the [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]], <math>S</math> the [[entropy]], <math>p</math> the [[pressure]], <math>V</math> the [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]], <math>\\mu</math> the [[chemical potential]], <math>N</math> the number of particles in the system, and <math>i</math> is the count of particles types in the system.\n\nThermodynamic potentials can be derived from the energy balance equation applied to a thermodynamic system. Other thermodynamic potentials can also be obtained through [[Legendre transformation]].\n\n=== Applied fields ===\n{{columns-list|3|\n* [[Atmospheric thermodynamics]]\n* [[Biological thermodynamics]]\n* [[Black hole thermodynamics]]\n* [[Chemical thermodynamics]]\n* [[Classical thermodynamics]]\n* [[Equilibrium thermodynamics]]\n* [[Industrial ecology]] (re: [[Exergy]])\n* [[Maximum entropy thermodynamics]]\n* [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics]]\n* [[Philosophy of thermal and statistical physics]]\n* [[Psychrometrics]]\n* [[Quantum thermodynamics]]\n* [[Statistical thermodynamics]]\n* [[Thermoeconomics]]\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Physics}}\n\n===Lists and timelines===\n*[[List of important publications in physics#Thermodynamics|List of important publications in thermodynamics]]\n*[[List of textbooks in statistical mechanics]]\n*[[List of thermal conductivities]]\n*[[List of thermodynamic properties]]\n*[[Table of thermodynamic equations]]\n*[[Timeline of thermodynamics]]\n\n=== Wikibooks ===\n* [[b:Engineering Thermodynamics|Engineering Thermodynamics]]\n* [[b:Entropy for beginners|Entropy for Beginners]]\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |author1=Goldstein, Martin |author2=Inge F.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=The Refrigerator and the Universe | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=1993 | isbn=0-674-75325-9 | oclc=32826343}} A nontechnical introduction, good on historical and interpretive matters.\n*{{cite journal\n  | last = Kazakov\n  | first = Andrei\n  | title = Web Thermo Tables \u2013 an On-Line Version of the TRC Thermodynamic Tables\n  | journal = Journal of Research of the National Institutes of Standards and Technology\n  | volume = 113\n  | issue = 4\n  | pages = 209\u2013220\n  | publisher =\n  | location =\n  | date = July\u2013August 2008\n  | url = http://nvl-i.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/jres/113/4/V113.N04.A03.pdf\n  | issn =\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | accessdate = }}\n\nThe following titles are more technical:\n* {{cite book | author=Cengel, Yunus A., & Boles, Michael A. | title=Thermodynamics - an Engineering Approach | publisher=McGraw Hill | year=2002 | isbn=0-07-238332-1 | oclc=45791449}}\n* {{cite book | author=Dunning-Davies, Jeremy | title=Concise Thermodynamics: Principles and Applications | publisher=Horwood Publishing | year=1997 | isbn=1-8985-6315-2 | oclc=36025958}}\n* {{cite book |author1=Kroemer, Herbert  |author2=Kittel, Charles  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Thermal Physics | publisher=W.
