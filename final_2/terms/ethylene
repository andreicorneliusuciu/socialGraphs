Ethylene is separated from the resulting mixture by repeated [[compression (physical)|compression]] and [[distillation]]. In a related process used in oil refineries, high molecular weight hydrocarbons are cracked over [[zeolite]] catalysts.

Most of the energy recovered from the cracked gas is used to make high pressure (1200 psig) steam. This steam is in turn used to drive the turbines for compressing cracked gas, the propylene refrigeration compressor, and the ethylene refrigeration compressor.

By inhibiting ethylene perception, fruits, plants and flowers don't respond to ethylene produced endogenously or from exogenous sources. Inhibitors of ethylene perception include compounds that have a similar shape to ethylene, but do not elicit the ethylene response. One example of an ethylene perception inhibitor is [[1-methylcyclopropene]] (1-MCP).\n\nCommercial growers of [[bromeliads]], including [[pineapple]] plants, use ethylene to induce flowering.

Thus, ''ethylene'' ({{chem|C|2|H|4}}) was the \"daughter of [[ethyl group|ethyl]]\" ({{chem|C|2|H|5}}). The name ethylene was used in this sense as early as 1852.\n\nIn 1866, the [[Germany|German]] chemist [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] proposed a system of hydrocarbon nomenclature in which the suffixes -ane, -ene, -ine, -one, and -une were used to denote the hydrocarbons with 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 fewer hydrogens than their parent [[alkane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chem.yale.edu/~chem125/125/history99/5Valence/Nomenclature/Hofmannaeiou.html|title=Hofmann's Proposal for Systematic Nomenclature of the Hydrocarbons|author=Hofmann, A. W. |accessdate=2007-01-06|publisher=www.chem.yale.edu}}</ref> In this system, ethylene became ''ethene''. Hofmann's system eventually became the basis for the Geneva nomenclature approved by the International Congress of Chemists in 1892, which remains at the core of the [[IUPAC]] nomenclature.
