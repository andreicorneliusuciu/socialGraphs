Datasets consisting of repeated standardized measurements can be used to assess temperature trends.\n\n== History==\nAttempts at standardized '''temperature measurement''' prior to the 17th century were crude at best. For instance in 170 AD, physician [[Galen|Claudius Galenus]]<ref name=quinn>{{cite book\n|author=T. J. Quinn\n|year=1983\n|title=Temperature\n|publisher=Academic Press\n|location=London\n}}\n</ref>  mixed equal portions of ice and boiling water to create a \"neutral\" temperature standard. The modern scientific field has its origins in the works by Florentine scientists in the 1600s including Galileo constructing devices able to measure relative change in temperature, but subject also to confounding with atmospheric pressure changes. These early devices were called [[thermoscope]]s. The first sealed thermometer was constructed in 1641 by the Grand Duke of Toscani, Ferdinand II.<ref name=quinn/> The development of today's [[thermometer]]s and [[temperature]] scales began in the early 18th century, when [[Gabriel Fahrenheit]] produced a [[mercury (element)|mercury]] thermometer and scale, both developed by [[Ole R\u00f8mer|Ole Christensen R\u00f8mer]]. Fahrenheit's scale is still in use, alongside the [[Celsius]] and [[Kelvin]] scales.\n\n== Technologies ==\nMany methods have been developed for measuring temperature. Most of these rely on measuring some physical property of a working material that varies with temperature. One of the most common devices for measuring temperature is the [[mercury-in-glass thermometer|glass thermometer]]. This consists of a glass tube filled with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or some other liquid, which acts as the working fluid. Temperature increase causes the fluid to expand, so the temperature can be determined by measuring the volume of the fluid. Such thermometers are usually calibrated so that one can read the temperature simply by observing the level of the fluid in the thermometer. Another type of thermometer that is not really used much in practice, but is important from a theoretical standpoint, is the [[gas thermometer]].\n\nOther important devices for measuring temperature include:\n* [[Thermocouple]]s\n* [[Thermistor]]s\n* [[Resistance temperature detector]] (RTD)\n* [[Pyrometer]]\n* [[Langmuir probe]]s (for electron temperature of a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]])\n* [[Infrared]]\n* Other [[thermometer]]s\n\nOne must be careful when measuring temperature to ensure that the measuring instrument (thermometer, thermocouple, etc.) is really the same temperature as the material that is being measured. Under some conditions heat from the measuring instrument can cause a temperature gradient, so the measured temperature is different from the actual temperature of the system. In such a case the measured temperature will vary not only with the temperature of the system, but also with the heat transfer properties of the system. An extreme case of this effect gives rise to the [[wind chill factor]], where the weather feels colder under windy conditions than calm conditions even though the temperature is the same. What is happening is that the wind increases the rate of heat transfer from the body, resulting in a larger reduction in body temperature for the same ambient temperature.\n\nThe theoretical basis for thermometers is the [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]] which postulates that if you have three bodies, A, B and C, if A and B are at the same temperature, and B and C are at the same temperature then A and C are at the same temperature.  B, of course, is the thermometer.\n\nThe practical basis of thermometry is the existence of [[triple point]] cells.  Triple points are conditions of pressure, volume and temperature such that three [[phase (matter)|phase]]s are simultaneously present, for example solid, vapor and liquid.  For a single component there are no degrees of freedom at a triple point and any change in the three variables results in one or more of the phases vanishing from the cell.  Therefore, triple point cells can be used as universal references for temperature and pressure (see [[Gibbs phase rule]]).\n\nUnder some conditions it becomes possible to measure temperature by a direct use of the [[Planck's law of black-body radiation]]. For example, the [[cosmic microwave background]] temperature has been measured from the spectrum of [[photon]]s observed by satellite observations such as the [[WMAP]]. In the study of the [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]] through  [[quark\u2013gluon plasma#How is this created in the lab?|heavy-ion collisions]], [[single particle spectra]] sometimes serve as a thermometer.\n\n=== Non-invasive thermometry ===\nDuring recent decades, many thermometric techniques have been developed. \nThe most promising and widespread non-invasive thermometric techniques are based on the analysis of magnetic resonance images, computerised tomography images and echotomography images. These techniques allow monitoring temperature within tissues without introducing a sensing element.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hyperthermal Procedure|url=http://www.mtmbilab.com/hyperthermal-procedure.html|website=Measurements and Biomedical Instrumentation Lab|publisher=Universit\u00e0 Campus Bio-Medico di Roma}}</ref>\n\n== Surface air temperature ==\n{{See also|Instrumental temperature record}}\nThe temperature of the air near the surface of the Earth is measured at meteorological observatories and [[weather stations]], usually using thermometers placed in a [[Stevenson screen]], a standardized well-ventilated white-painted instrument shelter. The thermometers should be positioned 1.25\u20132 m above the ground. Details of this setup are defined by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO).\n\nA true daily mean could be obtained from a continuously-recording [[thermograph]].  Commonly it is approximated by the mean of discrete readings (e.g. 24 hourly readings, four 6-hourly readings, etc.) or by the mean of the daily minimum and maximum readings (though the latter can result in mean temperatures up to 1&nbsp;\u00b0C cooler or warmer than the true mean, depending on the time of observation).<ref>\n{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Donald G. |title=Effect of Observation Time on Mean Temperature Estimation |journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology |date=June 1975 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=471\u2013476 |doi=10.1175/1520-0450(1975)014<0471:EOOTOM>2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1975JApMe..14..471B }}</ref>\n\nThe world's [[instrumental temperature record#Absolute temperatures v. anomalies|average surface air temperature]] is about 14&nbsp;\u00b0C.
