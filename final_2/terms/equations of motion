The most general choice are [[generalized coordinates]] which can be any convenient variables characteristic of the physical system.<ref name=\"Analytical Mechanics 2008\">''Analytical Mechanics'', L.N. Hand, J.D. Finch, Cambridge University Press, 2008, ISBN 978-0-521-57572-0</ref> The functions are defined in a [[Euclidean space]] in [[classical mechanics]], but are replaced by [[curved space]]s in [[Theory of relativity|relativity]]. If the [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of a system is known, the equations are the solutions to the [[differential equations]] describing the motion of the dynamics.\n\nThere are two main descriptions of motion: dynamics and [[kinematics]]. Dynamics is general, since momenta, [[force]]s and [[energy]] of the [[particles]] are taken into account. In this instance, sometimes the term refers to the differential equations that the system satisfies (e.g., [[Newton's second law]] or [[Euler\u2013Lagrange equations]]), and sometimes to the solutions to those equations.\n\nHowever, kinematics is simpler as it concerns only variables derived from the positions of objects, and time. In circumstances of constant acceleration, these simpler equations of motion are usually referred to as the \"SUVAT\"<!---THERE ARE NUMEROUS NAMES - PLEASE LEAVE THESE EQUATIONS AS \"SUVAT\" ---> equations, arising from the definitions of kinematic quantities: displacement ({{math|''s''}}), initial velocity ({{math|''u''}}), final velocity ({{math|''v''}}), acceleration ({{math|''a''}}), and time ({{math|''t''}}). ([[#Constant translational acceleration in a straight line|see below]])\n\nEquations of motion can therefore be grouped under these main classifiers of motion. In all cases, the main types of motion are [[Translation (physics)|translations]], [[Rotational motion|rotations]], [[oscillation]]s, or any combinations of these.\n\nA differential equation of motion, usually identified as some [[physical law]] and applying [[defining equation (physics)|definitions]] of [[physical quantities]], is used to set up an equation for the problem. Solving the differential equation will lead to a general solution with arbitrary constants, the arbitrariness corresponding to a family of solutions. A particular solution can be obtained by setting the [[Initial value problem|initial value]]s, which fixes the values of the constants.\n\nTo state this formally, in general an equation of motion {{math|''M''}} is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the [[Position (vector)|position]] {{math|'''r'''}} of the object, its [[velocity]] (the first time [[derivative]] of {{math|'''r'''}}, {{math|'''v''' {{=}} {{sfrac|''d'''''r'''|''dt''}}}}), and its acceleration (the second [[derivative]] of {{math|'''r'''}}, {{math|'''a''' {{=}} {{sfrac|''d''<sup>2</sup>'''r'''|''dt''<sup>2</sup>}}}}), and time {{math|''t''}}. [[Euclidean vector]]s in 3D are denoted throughout in bold. This is equivalent to saying an equation of motion in {{math|'''r'''}} is a second order [[ordinary differential equation]] (ODE) in {{math|'''r'''}},\n\n:<math>M\\left[\\mathbf{r}(t),\\mathbf{\\dot{r}}(t),\\mathbf{\\ddot{r}}(t),t\\right]=0\\,,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''t''}} is time, and each overdot denotes one [[time derivative]]. The [[Initial value problem|initial conditions]] are given by the ''constant'' values at {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}},\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{r}(0) \\,, \\quad \\mathbf{\\dot{r}}(0) \\,. </math>\n\nThe solution {{math|'''r'''(''t'')}} to the equation of motion, with specified initial values, describes the system for all times {{math|''t''}} after {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}. Other dynamical variables like the [[momentum]] {{math|'''p'''}} of the object, or quantities derived from {{math|'''r'''}} and {{math|'''p'''}} like [[angular momentum]], can be used in place of {{math|'''r'''}} as the quantity to solve for from some equation of motion, although the position of the object at time {{math|''t''}} is by far the most sought-after quantity.\n\nSometimes, the equation will be [[linear differential equation|linear]] and is more likely to be exactly solvable. In general, the equation will be [[Non-linear differential equation|non-linear]], and cannot be solved exactly so a variety of approximations must be used. The solutions to nonlinear equations may show [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] behavior depending on how ''sensitive'' the system is to the initial conditions.\n\n==History==\nHistorically, equations of motion first appeared in [[classical mechanics]] to describe the motion of [[mass|massive objects]], a notable application was to [[celestial mechanics]] to predict the motion of the planets as if they orbit like clockwork (this was how [[Neptune (planet)|Neptune]] was predicted before its discovery), and also investigate the [[stability of the solar system]].\n\nIt is important to observe that the huge body of work involving kinematics, dynamics and the mathematical models of the universe developed in baby steps \u2013 faltering, getting up and correcting itself \u2013 over three millennia and included contributions of both known names and others who have since faded from the annals of history.\n\nIn antiquity, notwithstanding the success of [[priest]]s, [[astrology|astrologers]] and [[astronomy|astronomers]] in predicting solar and lunar [[eclipses]], the solstices and the equinoxes of the [[Sun]] and the period of the [[Moon]], there was nothing other than a set of algorithms to help them. Despite the great strides made in the development of geometry made by Ancient Greeks and surveys in Rome, we were to wait for another thousand years before the first equations of motion arrive.\n\nThe exposure of Europe to the collected works by the Muslims of the Greeks, the Indians and the Islamic scholars, such as [[Euclid]]\u2019s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', the works of [[Archimedes]], and [[Al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b]]'s treatises <ref>See [[History of mathematics|History of Mathematics]]</ref> began in Spain, and scholars from all over Europe went to Spain, read, copied and translated the learning into Latin. The exposure of Europe to [[Arabic numerals]] and their ease in computations encouraged first the scholars to learn them and then the merchants and invigorated the spread of knowledge throughout Europe.\n\nBy the 13th century the universities of Oxford and Paris had come up, and the scholars were now studying mathematics and philosophy with lesser worries about mundane chores of life\u2014the fields were not as clearly demarcated as they are in the modern times. Of these, compendia and redactions, such as those of [[Johannes Campanus]], of Euclid and Aristotle, confronted scholars with ideas about infinity and the ratio theory of elements as a means of expressing relations between various quantities involved with moving bodies. These studies led to a new body of knowledge that is now known as physics.\n\nOf these institutes Merton College sheltered a group of scholars devoted to natural science, mainly physics, astronomy and mathematics, of similar in stature to the intellectuals at the University of Paris. [[Thomas Bradwardine#Science|Thomas Bradwardine]], one of those scholars, extended Aristotelian quantities such as distance and velocity, and assigned intensity and extension to them. Bradwardine suggested an exponential law involving force, resistance, distance, velocity and time. [[Nicole Oresme|Nicholas Oresme]] further extended Bradwardine's arguments. The Merton school proved that the quantity of motion of a body undergoing a uniformly accelerated motion is equal to the quantity of a uniform motion at the speed achieved halfway through the accelerated motion.\n\nFor writers on kinematics before [[Galileo]], since small time intervals could not be measured, the affinity between time and motion was obscure. They used time as a function of distance, and in free fall, greater velocity as a result of greater elevation. Only [[Domingo de Soto]], a Spanish theologian, in his commentary on [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' published in 1545, after defining \"uniform difform\" motion (which is uniformly accelerated motion) \u2013 the word velocity wasn't used \u2013 as proportional to time, declared correctly that this kind of motion was identifiable with freely falling bodies and projectiles, without his proving these propositions or suggesting a formula relating time, velocity and distance. De Soto's comments are shockingly correct regarding the definitions of acceleration (acceleration was a rate of change of motion (velocity) in time) and the observation that during the violent motion of ascent acceleration would be negative.\n\nDiscourses such as these spread throughout Europe and definitely influenced Galileo and others, and helped in laying the foundation of kinematics.<ref name=book>The Britannica Guide to History of Mathematics, ed. Erik Gregersen</ref> Galileo deduced the equation {{math|''s'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}''gt''{{sup|2}}}} in his work geometrically,<ref>Discourses, Galileo</ref> using Merton's rule, now known as a special case of one of the equations of kinematics. He couldn't use the now-familiar mathematical reasoning. The relationships between speed, distance, time and acceleration was not known at the time.\n\nGalileo was the first to show that the path of a projectile is a [[parabola]]. Galileo had an understanding of [[centrifugal force]] and gave a correct definition of [[momentum]]. This emphasis of momentum as a fundamental quantity in dynamics is of prime importance. He measured momentum by the product of velocity and weight; mass is a later concept, developed by Huygens and Newton. In the swinging of a simple pendulum, Galileo says in ''[[Two New Sciences|Discourses]]''<ref>Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences, by Galileo Galilei; translated by Henry Crew, Alfonso De Salvio</ref> that \"every momentum acquired in the descent along an arc is equal to that which causes the same moving body to ascend through the same arc.\" His analysis on projectiles indicates that Galileo had grasped the first law and the second law of motion. He did not generalize and make them applicable to bodies not subject to the earth's gravitation. That step was Newton's contribution.\n\nThe term \"inertia\" was used by Kepler who applied it to bodies at rest.The first law of motion is now often called the law of inertia.\n\nGalileo did not fully grasp the third law of motion, the law of the equality of action and reaction, though he corrected some errors of Aristotle. With Stevin and others Galileo also wrote on statics. He formulated the principle of the parallelogram of forces, but he did not fully recognize its scope.\n\nGalileo also was interested by the laws of the pendulum, his first observations was when he was a young man. In 1583, while he was praying in the cathedral at Pisa, his attention was arrested by the motion of the great lamp lighted and left swinging, referencing his own pulse for time keeping. To him the period appeared the same, even after the motion had greatly diminished, discovering the isochronism of the pendulum.\n\nMore careful experiments carried out by him later, and described in his Discourses, revealed the period of oscillation varies with the square root of length but is independent of the mass the pendulum.\n\nThus we arrive at [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], [[Isaac Newton]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], et al.; and the evolved forms of the equations of motion that begin to be recognized as the modern ones.\n\nLater the equations of motion also appeared in [[electrodynamics]], when describing the motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields, the [[Lorentz force]] is the general equation which serves as the definition of what is meant by an [[electric field]] and [[magnetic field]]. With the advent of [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]], the theoretical modifications to [[spacetime]] meant the classical equations of motion were also modified to account for the finite [[speed of light]], and [[curvature of spacetime]]. In all these cases the differential equations were in terms of a function describing the particle's trajectory in terms of space and time coordinates, as influenced by forces or energy transformations.<ref name=\"Halliday2004\">{{cite book |last1=Halliday |first1=David |first2=Robert |last2=Resnick  |first3=Jearl |last3=Walker |title=Fundamentals of Physics |publisher=Wiley |edition=7 Sub |date=2004-06-16 |isbn=0-471-23231-9}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the equations of [[quantum mechanics]] can also be considered \"equations of motion\", since they are differential equations of the [[wavefunction]], which describes how a quantum state behaves analogously using the space and time coordinates of the particles. There are analogs of equations of motion in other areas of physics, for collections of physical phenomena that can be considered waves, fluids, or fields.\n\n==Kinematic equations for one particle==\n\n===Kinematic quantities===\n[[File:Kinematics.svg|thumb|300px|Kinematic quantities of a classical particle of mass {{math|''m''}}: position {{math|'''r'''}}, velocity {{math|'''v'''}}, acceleration {{math|'''a'''}}.]]\n\nFrom the [[instantaneous]] position {{math|'''r''' {{=}} '''r'''(''t'')}}, instantaneous meaning at an instant value of time {{math|''t''}}, the instantaneous velocity {{math|'''v''' {{=}} '''v'''(''t'')}} and acceleration {{math|'''a''' {{=}} '''a'''(''t'')}} have the general, coordinate-independent definitions;<ref name=\"Relativity, J.R.

Loosely speaking, first order derivatives are related to tangents of curves. Still for curved paths, the acceleration is directed towards the [[center of curvature]] of the path. Again, loosely speaking, second order derivatives are related to curvature.\n\nThe rotational analogues are the \"angular vector\" (angle the particle rotates about some axis) {{math|'''\u03b8''' {{=}} '''\u03b8'''(''t'')}}, angular velocity {{math|'''\u03c9''' {{=}} '''\u03c9'''(''t'')}}, and angular acceleration {{math|'''\u03b1''' {{=}} '''\u03b1'''(''t'')}}:\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = \\theta \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\,,\\quad  \\boldsymbol{\\omega} = \\frac{d \\boldsymbol{\\theta}}{d t} \\,, \\quad \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}= \\frac{d \\boldsymbol{\\omega}}{d t} \\,,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''n\u0302'''}} is a [[unit vector]] in the direction of the axis of rotation, and {{math|''\u03b8''}} is the angle the object turns through about the axis.\n\nThe following relation holds for a point-like particle, orbiting about some axis with angular velocity {{math|'''\u03c9'''}}:<ref>{{cite book|title=Vector Analysis|edition=2nd|author1=M.R.

For a rotating continuum [[rigid body]], these relations hold for each point in the rigid body.\n\n===Uniform acceleration===\n\nThe differential equation of motion for a particle of constant or uniform acceleration in a straight line is simple: the acceleration is constant, so the second derivative of the position of the object is constant. The results of this case are summarized below.\n\n====Constant translational acceleration in a straight line====\n<!---THERE ARE NUMEROUS NAMES - PLEASE LEAVE THESE EQUATIONS AS \"SUVAT\" --->\nThese equations apply to a particle moving linearly, in three dimensions in a straight line with constant [[acceleration]].<ref name=\"Physics P.M\">Essential Principles of Physics, P.M.

Given initial speed {{math|''u''}}, one can calculate how high the ball will travel before it begins to fall. The acceleration is local acceleration of gravity {{math|''g''}}. At this point one must remember that while these quantities appear to be [[scalar (physics)|scalars]], the direction of displacement, speed and acceleration is important. They could in fact be considered as unidirectional vectors. Choosing {{math|''s''}} to measure up from the ground, the acceleration {{math|''a''}} must be in fact {{math|''\u2212g''}}, since the force of [[gravity]] acts downwards and therefore also the acceleration on the ball due to it.\n\nAt the highest point, the ball will be at rest: therefore {{math|''v'' {{=}} 0}}.

Replacing momentum by mass times velocity, the law is also written more famously as\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a} </math>\n\nsince {{math|''m''}} is a constant in [[Newtonian mechanics]].\n\nNewton's second law applies to point-like particles, and to all points in a [[rigid body]]. They also apply to each point in a mass continua, like deformable solids or fluids, but the motion of the system must be accounted for, see [[material derivative]]. In the case the mass is not constant, it is not sufficient to use the [[product rule]] for the time derivative on the mass and velocity, and Newton's second law requires some modification consistent with [[conservation of momentum]], see [[variable-mass system]].\n\nIt may be simple to write down the equations of motion in vector form using Newton's laws of motion, but the components may vary in complicated ways with spatial coordinates and time, and solving them is not easy. Often there is an excess of variables to solve for the problem completely, so Newton's laws are not always the most efficient way to determine the motion of a system. In simple cases of rectangular geometry, Newton's laws work fine in Cartesian coordinates, but in other coordinate systems can become dramatically complex.\n\nThe momentum form is preferable since this is readily generalized to more complex systems, generalizes to [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]] (see [[four-momentum]]).<ref name=\"Mechanics, D. Kleppner 2010, p. 112\"/> It can also be used with the momentum conservation. However, Newton's laws are not more fundamental than momentum conservation, because Newton's laws are merely consistent with the fact that zero resultant force acting on an object implies constant momentum, while a resultant force implies the momentum is not constant. Momentum conservation is always true for an isolated system not subject to resultant forces.\n\nFor a number of particles (see [[many body problem]]), the equation of motion for one particle {{math|''i''}} influenced by other particles is<ref name=\"Relativity, J.R.

The [[Newton\u2013Euler equations]] combine the forces and torques acting on a rigid body into a single equation.\n\nNewton's second law for rotation takes a similar form to the translational case,<ref>\"Mechanics, D.

These include\n\n* [[Maxwell's equations]] for the [[electromagnetic field]],\n* [[Poisson's equation]] for [[Newtonian gravitation]]al or [[electrostatic]] field potentials,\n* the [[Einstein field equation]] for [[gravitation]] ([[Newton's law of gravity]] is a special case for weak gravitational fields and low velocities of particles).\n\nThis terminology is not universal: for example although the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]] govern the [[velocity field]] of a [[fluid]], they are not usually called \"field equations\", since in this context they represent the momentum of the fluid and are called the \"momentum equations\" instead.\n\n===Wave equations===\n\nEquations of wave motion are called ''[[wave equation]]s''. The solutions to a wave equation give the time-evolution and spatial dependence of the [[amplitude]]. Boundary conditions determine if the solutions describe [[traveling wave]]s or [[standing waves]].\n\nFrom classical equations of motion and field equations; mechanical, [[gravitational wave]], and [[electromagnetic wave]] equations can be derived. The general linear wave equation in 3D is:\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{v^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 X}{\\partial t^2} = \\nabla^2 X  </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''X'' {{=}} ''X''('''r''', ''t'')}} is any mechanical or electromagnetic field amplitude, say:<ref>{{cite book|title=University Physics|author1=H.D.

Freedman |year=2008|edition=12th|publisher=Addison-Wesley (Pearson International)|isbn=0-321-50130-6}}</ref>\n\n* the [[Transverse wave|transverse]] or [[Longitudinal wave|longitudinal]] [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] of a vibrating rod, wire, cable, membrane etc.,\n* the fluctuating [[pressure]] of a medium, [[sound pressure]],\n* the [[electric field]]s {{math|'''E'''}} or {{math|'''D'''}}, or the [[magnetic field]]s {{math|'''B'''}} or {{math|'''H'''}},\n* the [[voltage]] {{math|''V''}} or [[Electric current|current]] {{math|''I''}} in an [[alternating current]] circuit,\n\nand {{math|''v''}} is the [[phase velocity]]. Nonlinear equations model the dependence of phase velocity on amplitude, replacing {{math|''v''}} by {{math|''v''(''X'')}}. There are other linear and nonlinear wave equations for very specific applications, see for example the [[Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation]].\n\n===Quantum theory===\n\nIn quantum theory, the wave and field concepts both appear.\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], in which particles also have wave-like properties according to [[wave\u2013particle duality]], the analogue of the classical equations of motion (Newton's law, Euler\u2013Lagrange equation, Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation, etc.) is the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] in its most general form:\n\n:<math>i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial\\Psi}{\\partial t} = \\hat{H}\\Psi \\,,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03a8''}} is the [[wavefunction]] of the system, {{math|''\u0124''}} is the quantum [[Hamiltonian operator]], rather than a function as in classical mechanics, and {{math|''\u0127''}} is the [[Planck constant]] divided by 2{{pi}}. Setting up the Hamiltonian and inserting it into the equation results in a wave equation, the solution is the wavefunction as a function of space and time. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation itself reduces to the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation when one considers the [[correspondence principle]], in the limit that {{math|''\u0127''}} becomes zero.\n\nThroughout all aspects of quantum theory, relativistic or non-relativistic, there are [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|various formulations]] alternative to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation that govern the time evolution and behavior of a quantum system, for instance: \n*the [[Heisenberg picture|Heisenberg equation of motion]] resembles the time evolution of classical observables as functions of position, momentum, and time, if one replaces dynamical observables by their [[operator (physics)|quantum operators]] and the classical [[Poisson bracket]] by the [[commutator]], \n*the [[phase space formulation]] closely follows classical Hamiltonian mechanics, placing position and momentum on equal footing,\n*the Feynman [[path integral formulation]] extends the [[principle of least action]] to quantum mechanics and field theory, placing emphasis on the use of a Lagrangians rather than Hamiltonians.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{multicol}}\n\n*[[Scalar (physics)]]\n*[[vector (geometry)|Vector]]\n*[[Distance]]\n*[[Displacement (vector)|Displacement]]\n*[[Speed]]\n*[[Velocity]]\n*[[Acceleration]]\n*[[Angular displacement]]\n*[[Angular speed]]\n*[[Angular velocity]]\n*[[Angular acceleration]]\n{{multicol-break}}\n\n*[[Equations for a falling body]]\n*[[Trajectory#Example: Constant gravity, no drag or wind|Parabolic trajectory]]\n*[[Curvilinear coordinates]]\n*[[Orthogonal coordinates]]\n*[[Newton's laws of motion]]\n*[[Torricelli's equation]]\n*[[Euler\u2013Lagrange equation]]\n*[[Generalized forces]]\n*[[Defining equation (physics)]]\n* [[Euler's laws of motion|Newton\u2013Euler laws of motion for a rigid body]]\n\n{{multicol-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Classical mechanics]]\n[[Category:Equations of physics]]"}]}}}}
