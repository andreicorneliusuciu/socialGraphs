[[Lenz's law]] describes the direction of the induced field. Faraday's law was later generalized to the Maxwell-Faraday equation, which is one of the equations in [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s theory of electromagnetism.\n\nElectromagnetic induction has found many applications in technology, including electrical components such as [[inductor]]s and [[transformer]]s, and devices such as [[electric motor]]s and [[electric generator|generator]]s.\n\n{{electromagnetism|cTopic=Electrodynamics}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Faraday emf experiment.svg|thumb|left|250px|A diagram of Faraday's iron ring apparatus.

He plugged one wire into a [[galvanometer]], and watched it as he connected the other wire to a battery. He saw a transient current, which he called a \"wave of electricity\", when he connected the wire to the battery and another when he disconnected it.<ref>''Michael Faraday'', by L. Pearce Williams, p. 182-3</ref> This induction was due to the change in [[magnetic flux]] that occurred when the battery was connected and disconnected.<ref name=Giancoli/> Within two months, Faraday found several other manifestations of electromagnetic induction. For example, he saw transient currents when he quickly slid a bar magnet in and out of a coil of wires, and he generated a steady ([[direct current|DC]]) current by rotating a copper disk near the bar magnet with a sliding electrical lead (\"Faraday's disk\").<ref>''Michael Faraday'', by L.

Heaviside's version (see [[#Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation|Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation below]]) is the form recognized today in the group of equations known as [[Maxwell's equations]].\n\nIn 1834 [[Heinrich Lenz]] formulated the law named after him to describe the \"flux through the circuit\".

The circuit is completed by brushes making sliding contact with top and bottom discs, which have conducting rims. This is a simplified version of the ''drum generator''.]]\n{{Main|Electric generator}}\nThe EMF generated by Faraday's law of induction due to relative movement of a circuit and a magnetic field is the phenomenon underlying [[electrical generator]]s. When a [[magnet|permanent magnet]] is moved relative to a conductor, or vice versa, an electromotive force is created. If the wire is connected through an [[electrical load]], current will flow, and thus [[electrical energy]] is generated, converting the mechanical energy of motion to electrical energy. For example, the ''drum generator'' is based upon the figure to the right. A different implementation of this idea is the [[Homopolar generator|Faraday's disc]], shown in simplified form on the right.\n\nIn the Faraday's disc example, the disc is rotated in a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the disc, causing a current to flow in the radial arm due to the Lorentz force. It is interesting to understand how it arises that mechanical work is necessary to drive this current. When the generated current flows through the conducting rim, a magnetic field is generated by this current through [[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law]] (labeled \"induced B\" in the figure). The rim thus becomes an [[electromagnet]] that resists rotation of the disc (an example of [[Lenz's law]]). On the far side of the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through the far side of the rim to the bottom brush. The B-field induced by this return current opposes the applied B-field, tending to ''decrease'' the flux through that side of the circuit, opposing the ''increase'' in flux due to rotation. On the near side of the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through the near side of the rim to the bottom brush. The induced B-field ''increases'' the flux on this side of the circuit, opposing the ''decrease'' in flux due to rotation. Thus, both sides of the circuit generate an EMF opposing the rotation. The energy required to keep the disc moving, despite this reactive force, is exactly equal to the electrical energy generated (plus energy wasted due to [[friction]], [[Joule heating]], and other inefficiencies). This behavior is common to all generators converting [[mechanical energy]] to electrical energy.\n\n===Electrical transformer===\n{{Main|Transformer}}\nWhen the electric current in a loop of wire changes, the changing current creates a changing magnetic field. A second wire in reach of this magnetic field will experience this change in magnetic field as a change in its coupled magnetic flux, ''d'' \u03a6<sub>B</sub> / ''d t''. Therefore, an electromotive force is set up in the second loop called the '''induced EMF''' or '''transformer EMF'''. If the two ends of this loop are connected through an electrical load, current will flow.\n\n====Current clamp====\n[[File:Current Clamp.jpg|thumb|150px|A current clamp]]\n{{Main|Current clamp}}\n\nA current clamp is a type of transformer with a split core which can be spread apart and clipped onto a wire or coil to either measure the current in it or, in reverse, to induce a voltage. Unlike conventional instruments the clamp does not make electrical contact with the conductor or require it to be disconnected during attachment of the clamp.\n\n===Magnetic flow meter===\n{{Main|magnetic flow meter}}\nFaraday's law is used for measuring the flow of electrically conductive liquids and slurries. Such instruments are called magnetic flow meters. The induced voltage \u2107 generated in the magnetic field ''B'' due to a conductive liquid moving at velocity ''v'' is thus given by:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{E}= - B \\ell v,</math>\n\nwhere \u2113 is the distance between electrodes in the magnetic flow meter.\n\n==Eddy currents==\n{{main|Eddy current}}\nConductors (of finite dimensions) moving through a uniform magnetic field, or stationary within a changing magnetic field, will have currents induced within them. These induced eddy currents can be undesirable, since they dissipate energy in the resistance of the conductor.\nThere are a number of methods employed to control these undesirable inductive effects.\n* Electromagnets in electric motors, generators, and transformers do not use solid metal, but instead use thin sheets of metal plate, called ''laminations''. These thin plates reduce the parasitic eddy currents, as described below.\n* Inductive coils in electronics typically use [[magnetic core]]s to minimize parasitic current flow. They are a mixture of metal powder plus a resin binder that can hold any shape. The binder prevents parasitic current flow through the powdered metal.\n\n===Electromagnet laminations===\n[[File:Hawkins Electrical Guide - Figure 292 - Eddy currents in a solid armature.jpg|300px|left]]\nEddy currents occur when a solid metallic mass is rotated in a magnetic field, because the outer portion of the metal cuts more lines of force than the inner portion, hence the induced electromotive force not being uniform, tends to set up currents between the points of greatest and least potential. Eddy currents consume a considerable amount of energy and often cause a harmful rise in temperature.<ref name=\"Imagesand\"><cite>Images and reference text are from the public domain book: [[Hawkins Electrical Guide]], Volume 1, Chapter 19: Theory of the Armature, pp. 270\u2013273, Copyright 1917 by Theo.

In practical use, the number of laminations or punchings ranges from 40 to 66 per inch, and brings the eddy current loss down to about one percent. While the plates can be separated by insulation, the voltage is so low that the natural rust/oxide coating of the plates is enough to prevent current flow across the laminations.<ref name=\"Imagesand\" />\n{{clear}}\n[[File:Small DC Motor pole laminations and overview.jpg|300px|left]]\nThis is a rotor approximately 20mm in diameter from a DC motor used in a {{nowrap|CD player.}} Note the laminations of the electromagnet pole pieces, used to limit parasitic inductive losses.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Parasitic induction within conductors===\n[[File:Hawkins Electrical Guide - Figure 291 - Formation of eddy currents in a solid bar inductor.jpg|300px|left]]\nIn this illustration, a solid copper bar conductor on a rotating armature is just passing under the tip of the pole piece N of the field magnet. Note the uneven distribution of the lines of force across the copper bar. The magnetic field is more concentrated and thus stronger on the left edge of the copper bar (a,b) while the field is weaker on the right edge (c,d). Since the two edges of the bar move with the same velocity, this difference in field strength across the bar creates whorls or current eddies within the copper bar.<ref name=\"Imagesand\"/>\n\nHigh current power-frequency devices, such as electric motors, generators and transformers, use multiple small conductors in parallel to break up the eddy flows that can form within large solid conductors. The same principle is applied to transformers used at higher than power frequency, for example, those used in [[switch mode power supply|switch-mode power supplies]] and the [[intermediate frequency]] coupling transformers of radio receivers.\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Maxwell's equations}}\n{{Div col||25em}}\n* [[Alternator]]\n* [[Crosstalk]]\n* [[Eddy current]]\n* [[Faraday paradox]]\n* [[Ground-level power supply]]\n* [[Inductance]]\n* [[Maxwell's equations]]\n* [[Moving magnet and conductor problem]]\n* [[Vector calculus]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n;References\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=vAsJAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:a+intitle:treatise+intitle:on+intitle:electricity+intitle:an+intitle:magnetism&cad=0_1#v=onepage&q&f=false Maxwell, James Clerk (1881), ''A treatise on electricity and magnetism, Vol. II'', Chapter III, \u00a7530, p.&nbsp;178.] Oxford, UK: Clarendon Press.
