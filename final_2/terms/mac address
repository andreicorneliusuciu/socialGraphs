MAC addresses are used as a [[network address]] for most [[IEEE 802]] network technologies, including [[Ethernet]] and [[WiFi]]. Logically, MAC addresses are used in the [[media access control]] protocol sublayer of the [[OSI model|OSI reference model]].\n\nMAC addresses are most often assigned by the manufacturer of a [[network interface controller]] (NIC) and are stored in its hardware, such as the card's [[read-only memory]] or some other [[firmware]] mechanism. If assigned by the manufacturer, a MAC address usually encodes the manufacturer's registered identification number and may be referred to as the '''burned-in address''' ('''BIA'''). It may also be known as an '''Ethernet hardware address''' ('''EHA'''), '''hardware address''' or ''physical address'' (not to be confused with a [[Physical address|memory physical address]]). This can be contrasted to a programmed address, where the host device issues commands to the NIC to use an arbitrary address.\n\nA [[network node]] may have multiple NICs and each NIC must have a unique MAC address. Sophisticated [[network equipment]] such as a [[multilayer switch]] or [[Router (computing)|router]] may require one or more permanently assigned MAC addresses.\n\nMAC addresses are formed according to the rules of one of three numbering name spaces managed by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE): '''MAC-48''', '''EUI-48''', and '''EUI-64'''. The IEEE claims [[trademark]]s on the names EUI-48<ref>{{cite web|title=Guidelines for 48-Bit Global Identifier (EUI-48)|url=https://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/eui48.pdf|website=IEEE Standards Association|publisher=IEEE|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref> and EUI-64,<ref name=\"eui64\">{{cite web|title=Guidelines for 64-Bit Global Identifier (EUI-64)|url=https://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/eui64.pdf|website=IEEE Standards Association|publisher=IEEE|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref> in which EUI is an abbreviation for '''Extended Unique Identifier'''.\n\n==Address details==\n[[File:MAC-48 Address.svg|right]]\nThe original [[IEEE 802]] MAC address comes from the original [[Xerox Network Systems|Xerox]] Ethernet addressing scheme.<ref name=\"Ieee802arch\">\n{{cite book\n  | publisher = The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

(Thus, by definition, an EUI-48 is not in fact a \"MAC address\", although it is syntactically indistinguishable from one and assigned from the same numbering space.)\n\nThe IEEE now considers the label MAC-48 to be an obsolete term, previously used to refer to a specific type of EUI-48 identifier used to address hardware interfaces within existing 802-based networking applications, and thus not to be used in the future. Instead, the proprietary term EUI-48 should be used for this purpose.\n\nIn addition, the EUI-64 numbering system encompasses both MAC-48 and EUI-48 identifiers by a simple translation mechanism.<ref name=\"eui64\" /> To convert a MAC-48 into an EUI-64, copy the OUI, append the two octets <tt>FF-FF</tt> and then copy the organization-specified extension identifier. To convert an EUI-48 into an EUI-64, the same process is used, but the sequence inserted is <tt>FF-FE</tt>. In both cases, the process can be trivially reversed when necessary. Organizations issuing EUI-64s are cautioned against issuing identifiers that could be confused with these forms. The IEEE has a target lifetime of 100 years for applications using MAC-48 space, but encourages adoption of EUI-64s instead.<ref name=\"IeeeEui\"/> \n\n[[IPv6]] \u2014 one of the most prominent standards that uses a Modified EUI-64 \u2014 treats MAC-48 as EUI-48 instead (as it is chosen from the same address pool) and toggles the U/L bit (as this makes it easier to type locally assigned IPv6 addresses based on the Modified EUI-64). This results in extending MAC addresses (such as IEEE 802 MAC address) to Modified EUI-64 using only <tt>FF-FE</tt> (and never <tt>FF-FF</tt>) and with the U/L bit inverted.<ref>{{cite web|rfc=5342|title=IANA Considerations and IETF Protocol Usage for IEEE 802 Parameters|publisher=IETF|date=September 2008|accessdate=2011-09-07}}</ref>\n\nAn [[Individual Address Block]] (IAB) was a 24-bit [[Organizationally Unique Identifier|OUI]] managed by the IEEE Registration Authority, followed by 12 IEEE-provided bits (identifying the organization), and 12 bits for the owner to assign to individual devices. An IAB is ideal for organizations requiring fewer than 4097 unique 48-bit numbers (EUI-48). IAB's have been replaced with 12-bit \"MA-S\" address blocks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://standards.ieee.org/faqs/regauth.html#20|title=What is an Individual Address Block?|last=IEEE-RA|accessdate=2016-06-16}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Universally administered address|Locally administered address}}\n\n===Universal vs. local===\nAddresses can either be ''universally administered addresses'' or ''locally administered addresses''. A universally administered address is uniquely assigned to a device by its manufacturer. The first three [[octet (computing)|octets]] (in transmission order) identify the organization that issued the identifier and are known as the [[Organizationally Unique Identifier]] (OUI).<ref name=\"IeeeEui\">{{cite web|url=http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/eui.pdf|title=Guidelines for use of the 24-bit Organizationally Unique Identifiers (OUI)|publisher=IEEE-SA|accessdate=2011-09-07}}</ref> The remainder of the address (three octets for MAC-48 and EUI-48 or five for EUI-64) are assigned by that organization in nearly any manner they please, subject to the constraint of uniqueness. A locally administered address is assigned to a device by a network administrator, overriding the burned-in address.\n\nUniversally administered and locally administered addresses are distinguished by setting the second-[[least significant bit|least-significant bit]] of the first octet of the address. This bit is also referred to as the U/L bit, short for Universal/Local, which identifies how the address is administered. If the bit is 0, the address is universally administered. If it is 1, the address is locally administered. In the example address 06-00-00-00-00-00 the first octet is 06 (hex), the binary form of which is 00000110, where the second-least-significant bit is 1. Therefore, it is a locally administered address.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/macgrp.pdf|title=Standard Group MAC Addresses: A Tutorial Guide|publisher=IEEE-SA|accessdate=2011-09-07}}</ref> Consequently, this bit is 0 in all OUIs.\n\n===Unicast vs. multicast===\nIf the least significant bit of the first octet of an address is set to 0 (zero), the [[Frame (networking)|frame]] is meant to reach only one receiving [[Network card|NIC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/fibre.pdf|title=Guidelines for Fibre Channel Use of the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)|publisher=IEEE-SA|accessdate=2011-09-08}}</ref> This type of transmission is called [[unicast]]. A unicast frame is transmitted to all nodes within the [[collision domain]], which typically ends at the nearest [[network switch]] or [[Router (computing)|router]]. A switch will forward a unicast frame through all of its ports (except for the port that originated the frame) if the switch has no knowledge of which port leads to that MAC address, or just to the proper port if it does have knowledge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://supportforums.cisco.com/document/68421/overview-layer-2-switched-networks-and-communication|title=Overview of Layer 2 Switched Networks and Communication {{!}} Getting Started with LANs {{!}} Cisco Support Community {{!}} 5896 {{!}} 68421|website=supportforums.cisco.com|access-date=2016-05-17}}</ref><ref>[[MAC Table]]</ref>{{failed verification|date=December 2013}} Only the node with the matching hardware MAC address will accept the frame; network frames with non-matching MAC-addresses are ignored, unless the device is in [[promiscuous mode]].\n\nIf the least significant bit of the first octet is set to 1, the frame will still be sent only once; however, NICs will choose to accept it based on criteria other than the matching of a MAC address: for example, based on a configurable list of accepted multicast MAC addresses. This is called [[multicast]] addressing.\n\nThe IEEE has built in several special address types to allow more than one [[Network Interface Card|network interface card]] to be addressed at one time:\n\n* Packets sent to the ''[[broadcast address]]'', all one bits, are received by all stations on a local area network. In [[hexadecimal]] the broadcast address would be <tt>FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF</tt>. A broadcast frame is [[Flooding (computer networking)|flooded]] and is forwarded to and accepted by all other nodes.\n* Packets sent to a ''[[multicast address]]'' are received by all stations on a LAN that have been configured to receive packets sent to that address.\n* '''Functional addresses''' identify one or more Token Ring NICs that provide a particular service, defined in [[IBM token ring|IEEE 802.5]].\n\nThese are all examples of ''group addresses'', as opposed to ''individual addresses''; the least significant bit of the first octet of a MAC address distinguishes individual addresses from group addresses. That bit is set to 0 in individual addresses and set to 1 in group addresses. Group addresses, like individual addresses, can be universally administered or locally administered.\n\n==Applications==\nThe following network technologies use the MAC-48 identifier format:\n*Ethernet\n*[[IEEE 802.11|802.11]] wireless networks\n*[[Bluetooth]]\n*IEEE 802.5 [[token ring]]\n*most other IEEE 802 networks\n*[[Fiber Distributed Data Interface]] (FDDI)\n*[[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM), switched virtual connections only, as part of an [[NSAP address]]\n*[[Fibre Channel]] and [[Serial Attached SCSI]] (as part of a [[World Wide Name]])\n*The [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] standard, which provides a way to create a high-speed (up to 1 gigabit/s) [[local area network]] using existing home wiring ([[Power line communication|power lines]], phone lines and [[Ethernet over coax|coaxial cables]]). The G.hn Application Protocol Convergence (APC) layer accepts Ethernet frames that use the MAC-48 format and encapsulates them into G.hn [[Medium Access Control]] Service Data Units (MSDUs).\n\nEvery device that connects to an IEEE 802 network (such as Ethernet and WiFi) has a MAC-48 address. Common networked consumer devices such as PCs, smartphones and tablet computers use MAC-48 addresses.\n\nEUI-64 identifiers are used in:\n*[[FireWire]]\n*[[IPv6]] (Modified EUI-64 as the least-significant 64 bits of a unicast network address or link-local address when stateless autoconfiguration is used)\n*[[ZigBee]] / [[IEEE 802.15|802.15.4]] / [[6LoWPAN]] wireless personal-area networks\n\n==Usage in hosts==\nOn broadcast networks, such as Ethernet, the MAC address uniquely identifies each [[node (networking)|node]] on that segment and allows frames to be marked for specific hosts. It thus forms the basis of most of the [[link layer]] (OSI [[Layer 2]]) networking upon which upper layer protocols rely to produce complex, functioning networks.\n\nAlthough intended to be a permanent and globally unique identification, it is possible to change the MAC address on most modern hardware. Changing MAC addresses is necessary in [[network virtualization]]. It can also be used in the process of exploiting security vulnerabilities.  This is called [[MAC spoofing]].\n\nIn [[Internet protocol suite|IP]] networks, the MAC address of an interface can be queried given the [[IP address]] using the [[Address Resolution Protocol]] (ARP) for [[Internet Protocol]] Version 4 ([[IPv4]]) or the [[Neighbor Discovery Protocol]] (NDP) for [[IPv6]]. In this way, ARP or NDP is used to translate IP addresses ([[OSI model|OSI]] layer 3) into Ethernet MAC addresses (OSI layer 2).\n\n==Spying==\nAccording to [[Edward Snowden]], the [[National Security Agency]] has a system that tracks the movements of everyone in a city by monitoring the MAC addresses of their electronic devices.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wired.com/2014/08/edward-snowden/ | title=The Most Wanted Man in the World | work=Wired | accessdate=2014-12-01 | author=Bamford, James | page = 4}}</ref>\nAs a result of users being trackable by their devices' MAC addresses, [[Apple Inc.]] has started using random MAC addresses in their [[iOS]] line of devices while scanning for networks.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/8233/20140612/apple-implements-random-mac-address-on-ios-8-goodbye-marketers.htm | title=Apple implements random MAC address on iOS 8.

The configuration is specific to the Operating System.  On most unix-like systems, the [[ifconfig]] command may be used to add and remove \"link\" (ethernet MAC family) address aliases.  For instance, the \"active\" ifconfig directive may then be used on [[NetBSD]] to specify which of the attached addresses to activate.<ref name=ifconfig>{{cite web|title=ifconfig(8) manual page|url=http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?ifconfig++NetBSD-current|accessdate=16 October 2016}}</ref> Hence, various configuration scripts and utilities allow to randomize the MAC address at boot or network connection time.\n\nUsing [[wireless access point|wireless access points]] in SSID-hidden mode (see [[network cloaking]]), a mobile wireless device may not only disclose its own MAC address when traveling, but even the MAC addresses associated to SSIDs the device has already connected to, if they are configured to send these as part of probe request packets.  Alternative modes to prevent this include configuring access points to be either in beacon-broadcasting mode, or probe-response with SSID mode.  In these modes, probe requests may be unnecessary, or sent in broadcast mode without disclosing the identity of previously-known networks.<ref name=Hidden network no beacons>{{cite web|title=Hidden network no beacons|url=http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/61576/hidden-network-no-beacons|accessdate=16 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Usage in switches==\n[[LAN_switching#Layer_2_switching|Layer 2 switches]] examine source and destination MAC addresses of packets to direct packet transmission to the intended recipient through a process called [[transparent bridging]].\n\nSwitches often have an internal host, with associated MAC address, for the purposes of [[network management]].\n\nSome switches have individual MAC addresses permanently assigned to each switch port. These MAC addresses are used for the source addresses on [[BPDUs|Spanning Tree Protocol BPDUs]].\n\n==Notational conventions==\nThe standard ([[IEEE 802]]) format for printing MAC-48 addresses in human-friendly form is six groups of two [[hexadecimal]] digits, separated by hyphens (<tt>-</tt>) in transmission order (e.g. <tt>01-23-45-67-89-ab</tt>).\nThis form is also commonly used for EUI-64 (e.g. <tt>01-23-45-67-89-ab-cd-ef</tt>).<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/eui64.pdf\n| title=Guidelines for 64-bit Global Identifier (EUI-64)\n| publisher=[[IEEE]]\n| accessdate=2015-10-11}}\n</ref>\nOther conventions include six groups of two [[hexadecimal]] digits separated by colons (<tt>:</tt>) (e.g. <tt>01:23:45:67:89:ab</tt>), and three groups of four [[hexadecimal]] digits separated by dots (<tt>.</tt>) (e.g. <tt>0123.4567.89ab</tt>); again in transmission order.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/net_mgmt/cisco_secure_access_control_server_for_windows/4.2/configuration/guide/noagent.html#wp1017547\n| title=Agentless Host Configuration Scenario\n| date=February 2008\n| work=Configuration Guide for Cisco Secure ACS 4.2\n| publisher=[[Cisco]]\n| accessdate=2015-09-19\n| quote=You can enter the MAC address in the following formats for representing MAC-48 addresses in human-readable form: six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by hyphens (-) in transmission order,[...]six groups of two separated by colons (:),[...]three groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by dots (.)...}}\n</ref>\n\n===Bit-reversed notation===\nThe standard notation, also called canonical format, for MAC addresses is written in transmission bit order with the least significant bit transmitted first, as seen in the output of the [[iproute2]]/[[ifconfig]]/[[ipconfig]] command, for example.\n\nHowever, since [[IEEE 802.3]] (Ethernet) and [[IEEE 802.4]] (Token Bus) send the bytes (octets) over the wire, left-to-right, with least significant bit in each byte first, while [[IEEE 802.5]] (Token Ring) and [[IEEE 802.6]] send the bytes over the wire with the most significant bit first, confusion may arise when an address in the latter scenario is represented with bits reversed from the canonical representation.  For example, an address in canonical form <code>12-34-56-78-9A-BC</code> would be transmitted over the wire as bits <code>01001000 00101100 01101010 00011110 01011001 00111101</code> in the standard transmission order (least significant bit first).  But for Token Ring networks, it would be transmitted as bits <code>00010010 00110100 01010110 01111000 10011010 10111100</code> in most-significant-bit first order. The latter might be incorrectly displayed as <code>48-2C-6A-1E-59-3D</code>. This is referred to as ''bit-reversed order'', ''non-canonical form'', ''MSB format'', ''IBM format'', or ''Token Ring format'', as explained in RFC 2469.  Canonical form is generally preferred, and used by all modern implementations.\n\nWhen the first switches supporting both Token Ring and Ethernet came out, some did not distinguish between canonical form and non-canonical form and so did not reverse MAC address bits as required.  This led to cases of duplicate MAC addresses in the field.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Organizationally Unique Identifier]]\n* [[IPv6|Internet Protocol version 6]]\n* [[Hot Standby Router Protocol]] or standard alternative VRRP [[Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol]], which allows multiple routers to share one [[IP address]] and MAC address to provide router redundancy.
