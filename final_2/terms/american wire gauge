Dimensions of the wires are given in [[ASTM]] standard B 258.<ref name=\"astmb258\"/> The cross-sectional area of each gauge is an important factor for determining its [[ampacity|current-carrying capacity]].\n\nIncreasing gauge numbers denote decreasing wire diameters, which is similar to many other [[SI|non-metric]] gauging systems such as [[Standard Wire Gauge|SWG]]. This gauge system originated in the number of [[wire drawing|drawing operations]] used to produce a given gauge of wire. Very fine wire (for example, 30&nbsp;gauge) required more passes through the [[draw plate|drawing dies]] than 0&nbsp;gauge wire did. Manufacturers of wire formerly had proprietary wire gauge systems; the development of standardized wire gauges rationalized selection of wire for a particular purpose.\n\nThe AWG tables are for a single, solid, round conductor. The AWG of a stranded wire is determined by the cross-sectional area of the equivalent solid conductor. Because there are also small gaps between the strands, a stranded wire will always have a slightly larger overall diameter than a solid wire with the same AWG.\n\n{{anchor|body_jewelry}}AWG is also commonly used to specify [[body jewelry sizes|body piercing jewelry sizes]] (especially smaller sizes), even when the material is not metallic.<ref>[http://www.steelnavel.com/reference.asp SteelNavel.com Body Piercing Jewelry Size Reference \u2014 illustrating the different ways that size is measured on different kinds of jewelry]</ref>\n\n==Formulae==\nBy definition, No.&nbsp;36&nbsp;AWG is 0.005&nbsp;inches in diameter, and No.&nbsp;0000 is 0.46&nbsp;inches in diameter. The ratio of these diameters is 1:92, and there are 40 gauge sizes from No.&nbsp;36 to No.&nbsp;0000, or 39 steps. Because each successive gauge number increases cross sectional area by a constant multiple, diameters vary geometrically.  Any two successive gauges (e.g., A & B ) have diameters in the ratio (dia. B \u00f7 dia. A) of <math>\\sqrt [39]{92}</math> (approximately 1.12293), while for  gauges two steps apart (e.g., A, B, & C), the ratio of the C to A is about 1.12293<sup>2</sup> = 1.26098.  The diameter of a No.&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;AWG wire is determined, for gauges smaller than 00 (36 to 0), according to the following formula:\n:<math>d_n = 0.005~\\mathrm{inch} \\times 92^\\frac{36 - n}{39} = 0.127~\\mathrm{mm} \\times 92^\\frac{36 - n}{39}</math>\n\n<small>(see below for gauges larger than No. 0 (i.e., No. 00, No. 000, No. 0000 ).)</small>\n\nor equivalently\n:<math>d_n = e^{-1.12436 - 0.11594n}\\ \\mathrm{inch} = e^{2.1104 - 0.11594n}\\ \\mathrm{mm} </math>\n\nThe gauge can be calculated from the diameter using&nbsp;<ref>The logarithm to the base 92 can be computed using any other logarithm, such as [[Common logarithm|common]] or [[natural logarithm]], using log<sub>92</sub>''x'' = (log ''x'')/(log 92).</ref>\n:<math>n = -39\\log_{92} \\left( \\frac{d_n}{0.005~\\mathrm{inch}} \\right) + 36 = -39\\log_{92} \\left( \\frac{d_n}{0.127~\\mathrm{mm}} \\right) + 36</math>\n\nand the cross-section area is\n:<math>A_n = \\frac{\\pi}{4} d_n^2 = 0.000019635~\\mathrm{inch}^2 \\times 92^\\frac{36 - n}{19.5} = 0.012668~\\mathrm{mm}^2 \\times 92 ^ \\frac{36 - n}{19.5}</math>,\n\nThe standard '''ASTM B258 - 02(2008) ''Standard Specification for Standard Nominal Diameters and Cross-Sectional Areas of AWG Sizes of Solid Round Wires Used as Electrical Conductors''''' defines the ratio between successive sizes to be the 39th root of 92, or approximately 1.1229322.<ref>ASTM Standard B 258-02, page 4</ref> ASTM B 258-02 also dictates that wire diameters should be tabulated with no more than 4 significant figures, with a resolution of no more than 0.0001&nbsp;inches (0.1&nbsp;mils) for wires larger than No. 44&nbsp;AWG, and 0.00001&nbsp;inches (0.01&nbsp;mils) for wires No. 45&nbsp;AWG and smaller.\n\nSizes with multiple zeros are successively larger than No.&nbsp;0 and can be denoted using \"''number of zeros''/0\", for example 4/0 for 0000.  For an ''m''/0 AWG wire, use {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} \u2212(''m'' \u2212 1) {{=}} 1 \u2212 ''m''}} in the above formulas. For instance, for No.&nbsp;0000 or 4/0, use {{nowrap|n {{=}} \u22123}}.\n\n===Rules of thumb===\nThe sixth power of <math>\\sqrt [39]{92}</math> is very close to 2,<ref>The result is roughly 2.0050, or one-quarter of one percent higher than 2</ref> which leads to the following rules of thumb:\n* When the ''[[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional]] area'' of a wire is doubled, the AWG will decrease by 3. (e.g., Two No.&nbsp;14 AWG wires have about the same cross-sectional area as a single No.&nbsp;11 AWG wire.)  This doubles the ampacity.\n* When the ''diameter'' of a wire is doubled, the AWG will decrease by 6. (e.g., No.&nbsp;2 AWG is about twice the diameter of No.&nbsp;8 AWG.)  This quadruples the cross-sectional area and the ampacity.\n* A decrease of ten gauge numbers, for example from No.&nbsp;10 to 1/0, multiplies the area and weight by approximately 10, and reduces the [[electrical resistance]] (and increases the [[Electrical conductance|conductance]]) by a factor of approximately 10.\n* For the same cross section, [[aluminum wire]] has a conductivity of approximately 61% of copper, so an aluminum wire has nearly the same resistance as a [[copper wire]] 2 AWG sizes smaller, which has 62.9% of the area.\n\n==Tables of AWG wire sizes==\nThe table below shows various data including both the resistance of the various wire gauges and the allowable current ([[ampacity]]) based on plastic insulation. The diameter information in the table applies to ''solid'' wires. [[Wire#Stranded wire|Stranded wires]] are calculated by calculating the equivalent [[cross section (geometry)|cross sectional]] [[Copper wire and cable|copper]] [[area]]. Fusing current (melting wire) is estimated based on 25&nbsp;[[Celsius|\u00b0C]] ambient temperature. The table below assumes [[direct current|DC]], or [[alternating current|AC]] frequencies equal to or less than 60&nbsp;Hz, and does not take [[skin effect]] into account.  Turns of wire is an upper limit for wire with no insulation.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"textalign:center;\"\n! rowspan=4 | AWG\n! rowspan=3 colspan=2 | Diameter\n! rowspan=3 colspan=2 | Turns of wire, <br />without insulation\n! rowspan=3 colspan=2 | Area\n! colspan=8 | [[Copper]] wire\n|-\n! rowspan=2 colspan=2 | [[Resistivity|Resistance/length]]<ref name=\"resperlength\">\nFigure for solid copper wire at 68&nbsp;[[\u00b0F]], (Not in accordance to NEC Codebook 2014 Ch. 9, Table 8) computed based on 100% IACS conductivity of 58.0&nbsp;M[[Siemens (unit)|S]]/m, which agrees with multiple sources:\n* {{Citation |url=http://www.powerstream.com/Wire_Size.htm |title=American Wire Gauge table and AWG Electrical Current Load Limits |author=Mark Lund, PowerStream Inc. |accessdate=2008-05-02}} (although the ft/m conversion seems slightly erroneous)\n* [[Belden (electronics company)|Belden]] Master Catalog, 2006, although data from there for gauges 35 and 37\u201340 seems obviously wrong.\n\nHigh-purity [[oxygen-free copper]] can achieve up to 101.5% IACS conductivity; e.g., the [http://www.kanthal.com/en/products/materials-in-wire-and-strip-form/wire/conductive-wire/copper/ Kanthal conductive alloys data sheet] lists slightly lower resistances than this table.\n</ref>\n! colspan=3 | [[Ampacity]],<ref name=\"ampacity\">\n''[http://bulk.resource.org/codes.gov/ NFPA 70 National Electrical Code 2014 Edition]''.

area in thousands of [[circular mil]]s (kcmil), where 1&nbsp;kcmil = 0.5067&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup>. The next wire size larger than 4/0 has a cross section of 250&nbsp;kcmil. A ''circular mil'' is the area of a wire one [[thou (unit of length)|mil]] in diameter. One million circular mils is the area of a circle with 1000&nbsp;mil (1&nbsp;inch) diameter. An older abbreviation for one thousand circular mils is ''MCM''.\n\n==Stranded wire AWG sizes==\nAWG gauges are also used to describe stranded wire. In this case, it describes a wire which is equal in cross-sectional area to the total of all the cross-sectional areas of the individual strands; the gaps between strands are not counted. When made with circular strands, [[circle packing|these gaps occupy about 10% of the wire area]], thus requiring a wire about 5% thicker than equivalent solid wire.\n\nStranded wires are specified with three numbers, the overall AWG size, the number of strands, and the AWG size of a strand. The number of strands and the AWG of a strand are separated by a slash. For example, a 22 AWG 7/30 stranded wire is a 22 AWG wire made from seven strands of 30 AWG wire.\n\n==Nomenclature and abbreviations in electrical distribution==\n{{main|Electric power distribution}}\nAlternative ways are commonly used in the electrical industry to specify wire sizes as AWG.\n* '''4 AWG'''  (proper)\n** '''#4''' (the [[number sign]] is used as an abbreviation for \"number\")\n** '''No. 4''' ([[Numero sign|No.]] is used as an abbreviation for \"number\")\n** '''No. 4 AWG'''\n** '''4 ga.''' (abbreviation for \"gauge\")\n* '''000 AWG''' (proper for large sizes)\n** '''3/0''' (common for large sizes)  Pronounced 3 aught\n** '''3/0 AWG'''\n** '''#000'''\n** '''#3/0'''\n\nThe industry also bundles [[electrical wiring|common wire]] for use in [[mains electricity]] distribution in homes and businesses, identifying a bundle's wire size followed by the number of wires in the bundle. The most common type of distribution cable, NM-B, is generally implied:\n* #14/2 (also written \"14-2\") is a nonmetallic (NM) sheathed bundle (-B) of ''two'' solid 14 AWG wires. The insulation surrounding the two conductors is white and black, for neutral and \"hot\" (electrified) respectively.  This sheath for 14 AWG cable is usually white when used for NM-B wiring intended for electrical distribution in a dry location, although older wire may be black.  #14 wire is used mainly in [[lighting]] circuits with a 15-ampere [[circuit breaker]].\n* #12/2 is a nonmetallic sheathed bundle of ''three'' solid 12 AWG wires having a bare ground in the middle of '''two''' insulated conductors in a flat-shaped NM-B yellow-colored sheath. The color is a North American industry standard for cables made since 2003, and aids identification.  It is always used for countertop appliance outlets in kitchens, and often for outlets in bathrooms (for high-wattage [[hair dryer]]s) and other rooms.\n* #10/'''3''' '''''with ground''''' (also written \"10-3 w/gnd\") is a nonmetallic sheathed bundle of ''four'' solid 10 AWG wires having a bare ground and '''three''' insulated conductors twisted into a round-shaped NM-B orange-colored sheath. The insulated conductors are black, white, and red, usually supplying both 120 and 240 volts for [[clothes dryer]]s.  Some cables of this type may be flat to save copper.\n* #8 and larger cables are now insulated in black, with 6/3 for 50-amp [[electric range]]s in kitchens, and 0/2 (two black-insulated #0 AWG wires, plus ground) for the main 200-amp cable from the [[weatherhead]] and [[electricity meter]] to the main breaker panel.\n\n14/3 and 12/3 cables are also available, used mainly between three-way (two-location) switches, and to have separate wall controls for [[ceiling fan]]s and their attached [[light fixture]]s, or to have one half of a duplex outlet switched and the other always on.  10/2 cable is rarely used, except for 120-volt 30-amp [[recreational vehicle]]s.  \n12/2 and 14/2 can also be used for the rare 240-volt-only 15- or 20-amp plug by clearly marking the white wire red, since there is no neutral wire.  Two conductor cable is available with black and red conductors only for this purpose; the outer sheath is likewise red.\n\n277/480-volt cable is identical to 120/240, except that neutral is grey and hot is yellow (plus an optional orange, used as the red is).  The higher voltage, used only in large non-[[residential]] buildings, allows more than twice as much [[electrical power]] (in [[watt]]s) to be drawn through the same gauge of wire.\n\nUF-B cable is \"underground feeder\" cable, which regardless of wire gauge has a solid waterproof grey sheath completely surrounding and filling the space between the conductors, which still have their individual colors.  Other types of armored or metallic cable (types AC and MC) have an aluminum casing that may be used as a ground conductor, for which it is not necessary to calculate an equivalent wire gauge.\n\nAll new cables are marked as being \"with ground\" or \"w/gnd\", since installation of ungrounded cables have been prohibited by [[electrical code]]s for decades.  The ground wire is typically the same gauge as the others, despite not being intended to carry large amounts of current for more than a few seconds in the event of a [[short circuit]].\n\n[[Table lamp]] wire is typically #18, while [[extension cord]]s are #16, with #14 common on cords grounded for outdoor use, and #12 available.  Mini [[Christmas lights]] were mostly #24 through 1997, when that gauge was arbitrarily de-rated from 3 to 2.5 amps, preventing manufacturers from getting [[Underwriters Laboratories|UL]] certification for the same products which had already been approved for more than two decades.  They were forced to use the formerly heavy-duty standard of #22 wire (itself de-rated from 5 to 4 amps), plus thicker insulation, which in turn caused them to shortchange customers by drastically shortening the light socket spacing and usable length of sets.  This change also made light strings stiff and unsightly.  Heavy-duty mini lights are now 20 AWG, with larger screw-in bulbs having sockets on 18 AWG lamp wire.\n\n==Pronunciation==\n''AWG'' is colloquially referred to as ''gauge'' and the zeros in large wire sizes are referred to as ''[[aught]]'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0254\u02d0|t}}. Wire sized 1 AWG is referred to as \"one gauge\" or \"No. 1\" wire; similarly, smaller diameters are pronounced \"''x'' gauge\" or \"No. X\" wire, where ''x'' is the positive integer AWG number.  Consecutive AWG wire sizes larger than No. 1 wire are designated by the number of zeros:\n* No. 0, typically written 1/0 and is referred to as \"one aught\" wire\n* No. 00, typically written 2/0 and is referred to as \"two aught\" wire\n* No. 000, typically written 3/0 and is referred to as \"three aught\" wire,\nand so on.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Brown & Sharpe]]\n*[[IEC 60228]], the metric wire-size standard used in most parts of the world.\n*[[Circular mil]], Electrical industry standard for wires larger than 4/0.\n*[[Standard wire gauge|Standard Wire Gauge (SWG)]], the British imperial standard BS3737, superseded by the metric.\n*[[Stubs Iron Wire Gauge]]\n*[[Jewelry wire gauge]]\n*[[Body jewelry sizes]]\n*[[Electrical wiring]]\n*[[Number 8 wire]], a term used in the New Zealand vernacular\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|40em|refs=\n<ref name=\"astmb258\">{{cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/B258.htm|title=ASTM B258 - 14 Standard Specification for Standard Nominal Diameters and Cross-Sectional Areas of AWG Sizes of Solid Round Wires Used as Electrical Conductors|publisher=[[ASTM International]]|accessdate=22 March 2015|location=[[West Conshohocken]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722072347/http://www.astm.org/Standards/B258.htm|archivedate=22 July 2014}}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Donald G.
