Most commonly, the silicone oil is [[polydimethylsiloxane]] (PDMS) and the thickener is [[amorphous]] [[fumed silica]]. Using this formulation, silicone grease is a translucent white viscous paste, with exact properties dependent on the type and proportion of the components. More specialized silicone greases are made from fluorinated silicones or, for low temperature applications, PDMS containing some [[phenyl]] substituents in place of methyl groups. For food applications, the thickener is [[calcium stearate]]. For applications involving highly reactive substances, powdered [[Teflon]] is the thickener.<ref>Thorsten Bartels et al. \"Lubricants and Lubrication\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a15_423}}</ref>\n\n==Use in industry==\nSilicone grease is commonly used for lubricating and preserving rubber parts, such as [[O-ring]]s. Additionally, silicone grease does not swell or soften the rubber, which can be a problem with [[hydrocarbon]] based greases. It functions well as a corrosion-inhibitor and lubricant for purposes that require a thicker lubricant.\n\n[[Thermal grease]] often consists of a       silicone grease base, along with added thermally conductive fillers.  It is used for heat transfer abilities, rather than friction reduction.\n\nSpecial versions of silicone grease are also used widely by the plumbing industry in faucets and seals, as well as dental equipment. These special versions are formulated using components not known to be an ingestion hazard. Electrical utilities use silicone grease to lubricate separable elbows on lines which must endure high temperatures. Silicone greases generally have an [[operating temperature]] range of approximately {{convert|-40|to|200|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} with some high-temperature versions extending that range slightly.\n\n==Use in the chemical laboratory==\nSilicone grease is widely used as a temporary sealant and a lubricant for interconnecting [[ground glass joint]]s, as is typically used in [[laboratory glassware]].  Although silicones are normally assumed to be chemically inert, several historically significant compounds have resulted from unintended reactions with silicones.<ref>Haiduc, I., \"Silicone Grease: A Serendipitous Reagent for the Synthesis of Exotic Molecular and Supramolecular Compounds\", Organometallics 2004, volume 23, pp. 3-8.  {{DOI|10.1021/om034176w}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n | title = Serendipitous Reactions Involving a Silicone Grease\n | author = Lucian C.

It can be used to lubricate fountain pen filling mechanisms and threads. It is used to seal and preserve O-rings in [[flashlight]]s, plumbing, waterproof watches, and air rifles.  Silicone grease is widely used to lubricate threads of water submersible flashlights used for diving and spearfishing. This grease improves water resistance of the flashlights and protects threads from wearing out. Silicone grease is used with waterproof devices as it has a very thick body and doesn't dissolve in water, as most spirits and other liquids would. Silicone-based lubricants are also commonly used for remote control hobbies, or for the insulation of CPU sockets when Overclocking at very low temperatures.\n\nVarious household uses include lubricating door hinges, shower heads, threads on bolts, garden hose threads or any thread or mechanism that can be lubricated.\n\n==As a sealant around electrical contacts==\n{{Cleanup rewrite|problems include lack of references, tone, and serious doubts about accuracy. Comments and suggestions are on the talk page|section|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Dielectric grease===\n\nDielectric grease is electrically [[Electrical insulation|insulating]] and does not break down when high voltage is applied. It is often applied to [[electrical connector]]s, particularly those containing rubber gaskets, as a means of lubricating and sealing rubber portions of the connector without [[arcing]].\n\nA common use of dielectric grease is in high-voltage connections associated with gasoline engine spark plugs. The grease is applied to the rubber boot of the plug wire. This helps the rubber boot slide onto the ceramic insulator of the plug. The grease also acts to seal the rubber boot, while at the same time preventing the rubber from becoming stuck to the ceramic. Generally, spark plugs are located in areas of high temperature and the grease is formulated to withstand the temperature range expected. It can be applied to the actual contact as well, because the contact pressure is sufficient to penetrate the grease film. Doing so on such high pressure contact surfaces between different metals has the advantage of sealing the contact area against electrolytes that might cause rapid deterioration from [[galvanic corrosion]].\n\nAnother common use of dielectric grease is on the rubber mating surfaces or gaskets of multi-pin electrical connectors used in automotive and marine engines. The grease again acts as a lubricant and a sealant on the nonconductive mating surfaces of the connector. It is not recommended to be applied to the actual electrical conductive contacts of the connector because it could interfere with the electrical signals passing through the connector in cases where the contact pressure is very low. Products designed as electronic connector lubricants, on the other hand, should be applied to such connector contacts and can dramatically extend their useful life. [[Polyphenyl Ether]], rather than silicone grease, is the active ingredient in some such connector lubricants.\n\nSilicone grease should not be applied to (or next to) any switch contact that might experience [[arcing]], as silicone can convert to [[Silicon_carbide|silicon-carbide]] under arcing conditions, and accumulation of the silicon-carbide can cause the contacts to prematurely fail. (British Telecom had this problem in the 1970s when silicone Symel\u00ae sleeving was used in telephone exchanges. Vapor from the sleeving migrated to relay contacts and the resultant silicon-carbide caused intermittent connection.)\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Silicon chemistry]]\n[[Category:Greases]]"}]}}}}
