The term is used in a wide variety of fields, from [[physics]] to the [[social sciences]] to indicate things that are in a state where they are able to change in ways ranging from the simple release of energy by objects to the realization of abilities in people. Examples include:\n\n*In linguistics, the [[Irrealis mood#Potential|potential mood]]\n*The mathematical study of potentials is known as [[potential theory]]; it is the study of [[harmonic functions]] on [[manifolds]].  This mathematical formulation arises from the fact that, in physics, the scalar potential is irrotational, and thus has a vanishing Laplacian \u2014 the very definition of a harmonic function.\n*In physics, a potential may refer to the [[scalar potential]] or to the [[vector potential]]. In either case, it is a field defined in space, from which many important physical properties may be derived.  \n**Leading examples are the [[gravitational potential]] and the [[electric potential]], from which the motion of gravitating or electrically charged bodies may be obtained. \n**Specific forces have associated potentials, including the [[Coulomb potential]], the [[van der Waals potential]], the [[Lennard-Jones potential]] and the [[Yukawa potential]].\n**In electrochemistry there are [[Galvani potential]], [[Volta potential]], [[electrode potential]], [[standard electrode potential]].\n**In thermodynamics potential refers to [[thermodynamic potential]].\n\n==See also==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [[Potential difference]]\n* [[Potential energy]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Potentials| ]]\n\n[[es:Potencial]]"}]}}}}
