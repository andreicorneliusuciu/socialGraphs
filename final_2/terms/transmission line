Transmission lines are used for purposes such as connecting [[Transmitter|radio transmitters]] and [[Radio receiver|receivers]] with their [[antenna (radio)|antennas]], distributing [[cable television]] signals, [[trunking|trunklines]] routing calls between telephone switching centres, computer network connections and high speed computer [[Bus (computing)|data buses]].\n\nThis article covers two-conductor transmission line such as parallel line ([[ladder line]]), [[coaxial cable]], [[stripline]], and [[microstrip]].  Some sources also refer to [[waveguide]], [[dielectric waveguide]], and even [[optical fiber|optical fibre]] as transmission line, however these lines require different analytical techniques and so are not covered by this article; see [[Waveguide (electromagnetism)]].\n\n==Overview==\nOrdinary electrical cables suffice to carry low frequency [[alternating current]] (AC), such as [[mains power]], which reverses direction 100 to 120 times per second, and [[audio signal]]s.  However, they cannot be used to carry currents in the [[radio frequency]] range,<ref name=\"Jackman\">{{cite book\n  | last = Jackman\n  | first = Shawn M.\n  |author2=Matt Swartz |author3=Marcus Burton |author4=Thomas W.

Transmission lines become necessary when the length of the cable is longer than a significant fraction of the transmitted frequency's wavelength.\n\nAt [[microwave]] frequencies and above, power losses in transmission lines become excessive, and [[waveguide]]s are used instead,<ref name=\"Jackman\" /> which function as \"pipes\" to confine and guide the electromagnetic waves.<ref name=\"Raisanen\" />  Some sources define waveguides as a type of transmission line;<ref name=\"Raisanen\" /> however, this article will not include them.  At even higher frequencies, in the [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]], [[infrared]] and [[light]] range, waveguides in turn become lossy, and [[optics|optical]] methods, (such as lenses and mirrors), are used to guide electromagnetic waves.<ref name=\"Raisanen\" />\n\nThe theory of [[sound wave]] propagation is very similar mathematically to that of electromagnetic waves, so techniques from transmission line theory are also used to build structures to conduct acoustic waves; and these are called [[acoustic transmission line]]s.\n\n==History==\n\nMathematical analysis of the behaviour of electrical transmission lines grew out of the work of [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[Lord Kelvin]] and [[Oliver Heaviside]].  In 1855 Lord Kelvin formulated a diffusion model of the current in a submarine cable.  The model correctly predicted the poor performance of the 1858 trans-Atlantic [[Submarine communications cable|submarine telegraph cable]].  In 1885 Heaviside published the first papers that described his analysis of propagation in cables and the modern form of the [[telegrapher's equations]].<ref>Ernst Weber and Frederik Nebeker, ''The Evolution of Electrical Engineering'', IEEE Press, Piscataway, New Jersey USA, 1994  ISBN 0-7803-1066-7</ref>\n\n==Applicability==\n\nIn many [[electric circuit]]s, the length of the wires connecting the components can for the most part be ignored. That is, the voltage on the wire at a given time can be assumed to be the same at all points. However, when the voltage changes in a time interval comparable to the time it takes for the signal to travel down the wire, the length becomes important and the wire must be treated as a transmission line. Stated another way, the length of the wire is important when the signal includes [[Harmonic analysis|frequency components]] with corresponding [[wavelength]]s comparable to or less than the length of the wire.\n\nA common rule of thumb is that the cable or wire should be treated as a transmission line if the length is greater than 1/10 of the wavelength. At this length the phase delay and the interference of any reflections on the line become important and can lead to unpredictable behaviour in systems which have not been carefully designed using transmission line theory.\n\n==The four terminal model==\n\n[[Image:Transmission line symbols.svg|thumb|Variations on the [[electronic schematic|schematic]] [[electronic symbol]] for a transmission line.]]\n\nFor the purposes of analysis, an electrical transmission line can be modelled as a [[two-port network]] (also called a quadripole), as follows:\n\n[[Image:Transmission line 4 port.svg]]\n\nIn the simplest case, the network is assumed to be linear (i.e. the [[complex number|complex]] voltage across either port is proportional to the complex current flowing into it when there are no reflections), and the two ports are assumed to be interchangeable.  If the transmission line is uniform along its length, then its behaviour is largely described by a single parameter called the ''[[characteristic impedance]]'', symbol Z<sub>0</sub>.  This is the ratio of the complex voltage of a given wave to the complex current of the same wave at any point on the line. Typical values of Z<sub>0</sub> are 50 or 75 [[Ohm (unit)|ohm]]s for a [[coaxial cable]], about 100 ohms for a twisted pair of wires, and about 300 ohms for a common type of untwisted pair used in radio transmission.\n\nWhen sending power down a transmission line, it is usually desirable that as much power as possible will be absorbed by the load and as little as possible will be reflected back to the source.  This can be ensured by making the load impedance equal to Z<sub>0</sub>, in which case the transmission line is said to be ''[[impedance matching|matched]]''.\n\n[[File:TransmissionLineDefinitions.svg|thumb|310px|A transmission line is drawn as two black wires. At a distance ''x'' into the line, there is current ''I(x)'' travelling through each wire, and there is a voltage difference ''V(x)'' between the wires. If the current and voltage come from a single wave (with no reflection), then ''V''(''x'')&nbsp;/&nbsp;''I''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''Z''<sub>0</sub>, where ''Z''<sub>0</sub> is the ''[[characteristic impedance]]'' of the line.]]\n\nSome of the power that is fed into a transmission line is lost because of its resistance.  This effect is called ''ohmic'' or ''resistive'' loss (see [[ohmic heating]]).  At high frequencies, another effect called ''dielectric loss'' becomes significant, adding to the losses caused by resistance.  Dielectric loss is caused when the insulating material inside the transmission line absorbs energy from the alternating electric field and converts it to [[heat]] (see [[dielectric heating]]). The transmission line is modelled with a resistance (R) and inductance (L) in series with a capacitance (C) and conductance (G) in parallel. The resistance and conductance contribute to the loss in a transmission line.\n\nThe total loss of power in a transmission line is often specified in [[decibels]] per [[metre]] (dB/m), and usually depends on the frequency of the signal.  The manufacturer often supplies a chart showing the loss in dB/m at a range of frequencies.  A loss of 3&nbsp;dB corresponds approximately to a halving of the power.\n\nHigh-frequency transmission lines can be defined as those designed to carry electromagnetic waves whose [[wavelength]]s are shorter than or comparable to the length of the line.  Under these conditions, the approximations useful for calculations at lower frequencies are no longer accurate.  This often occurs with [[radio]], [[microwave]] and [[light|optical]] signals, [[metal mesh optical filters]], and with the signals found in high-speed [[digital circuit]]s.\n\n==Telegrapher's equations==\n{{Main|Telegrapher's equations}}\n{{See also|Reflections on copper lines}}\n\nThe '''telegrapher's equations''' (or just '''telegraph equations''') are a pair of linear differential equations which describe the [[voltage]] and [[Electric current|current]] on an electrical transmission line with distance and time. They were developed by [[Oliver Heaviside]] who created the ''transmission line model'', and are based on [[Maxwell's Equations]].\n\n[[Image:Transmission line element.svg|thumb|right|250px|Schematic representation of the elementary component of a transmission line.]]\nThe transmission line model represents the transmission line as an infinite series of two-port elementary components, each representing an infinitesimally short segment of the transmission line:\n\n* The distributed resistance <math>R</math> of the conductors is represented by a series resistor (expressed in ohms per unit length).\n* The distributed inductance <math>L</math> (due to the [[magnetic field]] around the wires, [[self-inductance]], etc.) is represented by a series [[inductor]] ([[henry (unit)|henries]] per unit length).\n* The capacitance <math>C</math> between the two conductors is represented by a [[Shunt (electrical)|shunt]] [[capacitor]] C ([[farad]]s per unit length).\n* The [[Electric conductance|conductance]] <math>G</math> of the dielectric material separating the two conductors is represented by a shunt resistor between the signal wire and the return wire ([[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] per unit length).\n\nThe model consists of an ''infinite series'' of the elements shown in the figure, and the values of the components are specified ''per unit length'' so the picture of the component can be misleading. <math>R</math>, <math>L</math>, <math>C</math>, and <math>G</math> may also be functions of frequency. An alternative notation is to use <math>R'</math>, <math>L'</math>, <math>C'</math> and <math>G'</math> to emphasize that the values are derivatives with respect to length.  These quantities can also be known as the [[primary line constants]] to distinguish from the secondary line constants derived from them, these being the [[propagation constant]], [[attenuation constant]] and [[phase constant]].\n\nThe line voltage <math>V(x)</math> and the current <math>I(x)</math> can be expressed in the frequency domain as\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial V(x)}{\\partial x} = -(R + j \\omega L)I(x)</math>\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial I(x)}{\\partial x} = -(G + j \\omega C)V(x).</math>\n\nWhen the elements <math>R</math> and <math>G</math> are negligibly small the transmission line is considered as a lossless structure. In this hypothetical case, the model depends only on the <math>L</math> and <math>C</math> elements which greatly simplifies the analysis. For a lossless transmission line, the second order steady-state Telegrapher's equations are:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial^2V(x)}{\\partial x^2}+ \\omega^2 LC\\cdot V(x)=0</math>\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial^2I(x)}{\\partial x^2} + \\omega^2 LC\\cdot I(x)=0.</math>\n\nThese are [[wave equation]]s which have [[plane wave]]s with equal propagation speed in the forward and reverse directions as solutions. The physical significance of this is that electromagnetic waves propagate down transmission lines and in general, there is a reflected component that interferes with the original signal. These equations are fundamental to transmission line theory.\n\nIf <math>R</math> and <math>G</math> are not neglected, the Telegrapher's equations become:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial^2V(x)}{\\partial x^2} = \\gamma^2 V(x)</math>\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial^2I(x)}{\\partial x^2} = \\gamma^2 I(x)</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03b3''}} is the [[propagation constant]]\n\n:<math>\\gamma = \\sqrt{(R + j \\omega L)(G + j \\omega C)}</math>\n\nand the characteristic impedance can be expressed as\n\n:<math>Z_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{R + j \\omega L}{G + j \\omega C}}.</math>\n\nThe solutions for <math>V(x)</math> and <math>I(x)</math> are:\n\n:<math>V(x) = V^+ e^{-\\gamma x} + V^- e^{\\gamma x} \\,</math>\n\n:<math>I(x) = \\frac{1}{Z_0}(V^+ e^{-\\gamma x} - V^- e^{\\gamma x}). \\,</math>\n\nThe constants <math>V^\\pm</math> and <math>I^\\pm</math> must be determined from boundary conditions.

(This impedance is characterized by its [[reflection coefficient]] {{math|''V<sub>reflected</sub>'' / ''V<sub>incident</sub>''}}.) The blue circle, centred within the chart, is sometimes called an ''SWR circle'' (short for ''constant [[standing wave ratio]]'').]]\n\nThe [[characteristic impedance]] {{math|''Z''<sub>0</sub>}} of a transmission line is the ratio of the amplitude of a ''single'' voltage wave to its current wave. Since most transmission lines also have a reflected wave, the characteristic impedance is generally not the impedance that is measured on the line.\n\nThe impedance measured at a given distance, {{math|''l''}}, from the load impedance {{math|''Z<sub>L</sub>''}} may be expressed as,\n\n:<math>Z_{in}\\left(l\\right)=\\frac{V(l)}{I(l)}=Z_0 \\frac{1 + \\Gamma_L e^{-2 \\gamma l}}{1 - \\Gamma_L e^{-2 \\gamma l}}</math>,\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03b3''}} is the propagation constant and <math>\\Gamma_L=\\left(Z_L - Z_0\\right)/\\left(Z_L + Z_0\\right)</math> is the voltage [[reflection coefficient]] at the load end of the transmission line. Alternatively, the above formula can be rearranged to express the input impedance in terms of the load impedance rather than the load voltage reflection coefficient:\n\n:<math>Z_{in}\\left(l\\right)=Z_0 \\frac{Z_L + Z_0 \\tanh\\left(\\gamma l\\right)}{Z_0 + Z_L\\tanh\\left(\\gamma l\\right)}</math>.\n\n===Input impedance of lossless transmission line===\nFor a lossless transmission line, the propagation constant is purely imaginary, {{math|''\u03b3''{{=}}''j\u03b2''}}, so the above formulas can be rewritten as,\n\n:<math>\nZ_\\mathrm{in} (l)=Z_0 \\frac{Z_L + jZ_0\\tan(\\beta l)}{Z_0 + jZ_L\\tan(\\beta l)}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\beta=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}</math> is the [[wavenumber]].\n\nIn calculating {{math|''\u03b2''}}, the wavelength is generally different inside the transmission line to what it would be in free-space and the velocity constant of the material the transmission line is made of needs to be taken into account when doing such a calculation.\n\n===Special cases of lossless transmission lines===\n\n====Half wave length====\nFor the special case where <math>\\beta l= n\\pi</math> where n is an integer (meaning that the length of the line is a multiple of half a wavelength), the expression reduces to the load impedance so that\n:\n<math>Z_\\mathrm{in}=Z_L \\,</math>\n\nfor all {{math|''n''}}.  This includes the case when {{math|''n''{{=}}0}}, meaning that the length of the transmission line is negligibly small compared to the wavelength. The physical significance of this is that the transmission line can be ignored (i.e. treated as a wire) in either case.\n\n====Quarter wave length====\n{{Main|quarter wave impedance transformer}}\nFor the case where the length of the line is one quarter wavelength long, or an odd multiple of a quarter wavelength long, the input impedance becomes\n:<math>\nZ_\\mathrm{in}=\\frac{{Z_0}^2}{Z_L}. \\,\n</math>\n\n====Matched load====\nAnother special case is when the load impedance is equal to the characteristic impedance of the line (i.e. the line is ''matched''), in which case the impedance reduces to the characteristic impedance of the line so that\n:<math>\nZ_\\mathrm{in}=Z_L=Z_0 \\,\n</math>\nfor all <math>l</math> and all <math>\\lambda</math>.\n\n====Short====\n[[File:Transmission line animation open short2.gif|thumb|right|300px|[[Standing wave]]s on a transmission line with an open-circuit load (top), and a short-circuit load (bottom).

Conversely, if Z<sub>0,i</sub> > Z<sub>0</sub>, the impedance curve should be off-centred towards the +x axis.]]Because the characteristic impedance of each transmission line segment Z<sub>0,i</sub> is often different from that of the input cable Z<sub>0</sub>, the impedance transformation circle is off-centred along the x axis of the [[Smith Chart]] whose impedance representation is usually normalized against Z<sub>0</sub>.\n\n==Practical types==<!-- This section is linked from [[Wikipedia:Proposed mergers]] -->\n\n===Coaxial cable===\n\n{{Main|coaxial cable}}\n\nCoaxial lines confine virtually all of the electromagnetic wave to the area inside the cable. Coaxial lines can therefore be bent and twisted (subject to limits) without negative effects, and they can be strapped to conductive supports without inducing unwanted currents in them.\nIn radio-frequency applications up to a few gigahertz, the wave propagates in the [[transverse electric and magnetic mode]] (TEM) only, which means that the electric and magnetic fields are both perpendicular to the direction of propagation (the electric field is radial, and the magnetic field is circumferential). However, at frequencies for which the wavelength (in the dielectric) is significantly shorter than the circumference of the cable, transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) [[waveguide]] modes can also propagate. When more than one mode can exist, bends and other irregularities in the cable geometry can cause power to be transferred from one mode to another.\n\nThe most common use for coaxial cables is for television and other signals with bandwidth of multiple megahertz. In the middle 20th century they carried [[long distance telephone]] connections.\n\n[[Image:Solec Kujawski longwave antenna feeder.jpg|thumb|right|A type of transmission line called a ''cage line'', used for high power, low frequency applications.  It functions similarly to a large coaxial cable.   This example is the antenna [[feedline]] for a [[longwave]] radio transmitter in [[Poland]], which operates at a frequency of 225 kHz and a power of 1200 kW.]]\n\n===Microstrip===\n\n{{Main|microstrip}}\n\nA microstrip circuit uses a thin flat conductor which is [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to a [[ground plane]]. Microstrip can be made by having a strip of copper on one side of a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) or ceramic substrate while the other side is a continuous ground plane. The width of the strip, the thickness of the insulating layer (PCB or ceramic) and the [[dielectric constant]] of the insulating layer determine the characteristic impedance. Microstrip is an open structure whereas coaxial cable is a closed structure.\n\n===Stripline===\n\n{{main|Stripline}}\n\nA stripline circuit uses a flat strip of metal which is sandwiched between two parallel ground planes. The insulating material of the substrate forms a dielectric. The width of the strip, the thickness of the substrate and the relative permittivity of the substrate determine the characteristic impedance of the strip which is a transmission line.\n\n===Balanced lines===\n{{Main|Balanced line}}\nA balanced line is a transmission line consisting of two conductors of the same type, and equal impedance to ground and other circuits.  There are many formats of balanced lines, amongst the most common are twisted pair, star quad and twin-lead.\n\n====Twisted pair====\n{{Main|Twisted pair}}\nTwisted pairs are commonly used for terrestrial [[telephone]] communications.  In such cables, many pairs are grouped together in a single cable, from two to several thousand.<ref>Syed V. Ahamed, Victor B. Lawrence, ''Design and engineering of intelligent communication systems'', pp.130-131, Springer, 1997 ISBN 0-7923-9870-X.</ref>  The format is also used for data network distribution inside buildings, but the cable is more expensive because the transmission line parameters are tightly controlled.\n\n====Star quad====\n{{Main|Star quad cable}}\nStar quad is a four-conductor cable in which all four conductors are twisted together around the cable axis.  It is sometimes used for two circuits, such as [[4-wire]] telephony and other telecommunications applications.  In this configuration each pair uses two non-adjacent conductors.  Other times it is used for a single, [[balanced line]], such as audio applications and [[2-wire]] telephony.  In this configuration two non-adjacent conductors are terminated together at both ends of the cable, and the other two conductors are also terminated together.\n\nWhen used for two circuits, crosstalk is reduced relative to cables with two separate twisted pairs.\n\nWhen used for a single, [[balanced line]], magnetic interference picked up by the cable arrives as a virtually perfect common mode signal, which is easily removed by coupling transformers.\n\nThe combined benefits of twisting, balanced signalling, and quadrupole pattern give outstanding noise immunity, especially advantageous for low signal level applications such as microphone cables, even when installed very close to a power cable.<ref>''[http://benchmarkmedia.com/blogs/application_notes/116637511-the-importance-of-star-quad-microphone-cable The Importance of Star-Quad Microphone Cable]''</ref><ref>''[http://www.canare.com/UploadedDocuments/A%20Technical%20Paper%20-%20Evaluating%20Microphone%20Cable%20Perfrmance%20and%20Specifications.pdf Evaluating Microphone Cable Performance & Specifications]''</ref><ref>''[http://www.canare.com/UploadedDocuments/Cat11_p35.pdf The Star Quad Story]''</ref><ref>''[https://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov09/articles/qa1109_4.htm What's Special About Star-Quad Cable?]''</ref><ref>''[http://www.belden.com/blog/broadcastav/How-Starquad-Works.cfm How Starquad Works]''</ref> The disadvantage is that star quad, in combining two conductors, typically has double the capacitance of similar two-conductor twisted and shielded audio cable. High capacitance causes increasing distortion and greater loss of high frequencies as distance increases.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lampen|first=Stephen H.|title=Audio/Video Cable Installer's Pocket Guide|year=2002|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0071386211|pages=32, 110, 112}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Rayburn|first=Ray|title=Eargle's The Microphone Book: From Mono to Stereo to Surround \u2013 A Guide to Microphone Design and Application|edition=3|year=2011|publisher=Focal Press|isbn=0240820754|pages=164\u2013166}}</ref>\n\n====Twin-lead====\n{{Main|Twin-lead}}\nTwin-lead consists of a pair of conductors held apart by a continuous insulator.  By holding the conductors a known distance apart, the geometry is fixed and the line characteristics are reliably consistent.  It is lower loss than coaxial cable because the wave propagates mostly in air rather than the thin dielectric.  However, it is more susceptible to interference.\n\n====Lecher lines====\n{{Main|Lecher lines}}\nLecher lines are a form of parallel conductor that can be used at [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] for creating resonant circuits.  They are a convenient practical format that fills the gap between [[Lumped element model|lumped]] components (used at [[High frequency|HF]]/[[VHF]]) and [[Resonant cavity|resonant cavities]] (used at [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]]/[[Super high frequency|SHF]]).\n\n===Single-wire line===\n[[Unbalanced line]]s were formerly much used for telegraph transmission, but this form of communication has now fallen into disuse.  Cables are similar to twisted pair in that many cores are bundled into the same cable but only one conductor is provided per circuit and there is no twisting.  All the circuits on the same route use a common path for the return current (earth return).  There is a [[Electric power transmission|power transmission]] version of [[single-wire earth return]] in use in many locations.\n\n==General applications==\n\n===Signal transfer===\n\nElectrical transmission lines are very widely used to transmit high frequency signals over long or short distances with minimum power loss.  One familiar example is the [[down lead]] from a TV or radio [[Antenna (radio)|aerial]] to the receiver.\n\n===Pulse generation===\n\nTransmission lines are also used as pulse generators. By charging the transmission line and then discharging it into a [[resistive]] load, a rectangular pulse equal in length to twice the [[electrical length]] of the line can be obtained, although with half the voltage. A [[Blumlein transmission line]] is a related pulse forming device that overcomes this limitation. These are sometimes used as the [[pulsed power]] sources for [[radar]] [[transmitters]] and other devices.\n\n===Stub filters===\n{{see also|Distributed element filter#Stub band-pass filters}}\nIf a short-circuited or open-circuited transmission line is wired in parallel with a line used to transfer signals from point A to point B, then it will function as a filter. The method for making stubs is similar to the method for using Lecher lines for crude frequency measurement, but it is 'working backwards'. One method recommended in the [[Radio Society of Great Britain|RSGB]]'s radiocommunication handbook is to take an open-circuited length of transmission line wired in parallel with the feeder delivering signals from an aerial. By cutting the free end of the transmission line, a minimum in the strength of the signal observed at a receiver can be found. At this stage the stub filter will reject this frequency and the odd harmonics, but if the free end of the stub is shorted then the stub will become a filter rejecting the even harmonics.\n\n==Acoustic transmission lines==\n{{Main|Acoustic transmission line}}\n\nAn acoustic transmission line is the [[Acoustics|acoustic]] [[analogy|analogue]] of the electrical transmission line, typically thought of as a rigid-walled tube that is long and thin relative to the wavelength of sound present in it.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col||25em}}\n* [[Distributed element model]]\n* [[Heaviside condition]]\n* [[Longitudinal wave|Longitudinal electromagnetic wave]]\n* [[Propagation velocity]]\n* [[Radio frequency power transmission]]\n* [[Time domain reflectometer]]\n* [[Transverse wave|Transverse electromagnetic wave]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n''Part of this article was derived from [[Federal Standard 1037C]].''\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n*{{Citation\n |last= Steinmetz\n |first= Charles Proteus\n |authorlink= Charles Proteus Steinmetz\n |title= The Natural Period of a Transmission Line and the Frequency of lightning Discharge Therefrom\n |journal=The Electrical World\n |date= August 27, 1898\n |pages= 203&ndash;205\n |issn=\n |doi=}}\n*{{Citation\n |title= Electromagnetism\n |edition= 2nd\n |last=Grant\n |first= I.
