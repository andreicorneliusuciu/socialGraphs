The frame assembly beneath each end of a car, [[railcar]] or [[locomotive]] that holds the wheelsets is called the [[bogie]] (or truck in [[North America]]). Most North American [[Railroad car#Freight cars|freight cars]] have two bogies with two or three wheelsets, depending on the type of car; short [[Goods wagon|freight cars]] generally have no bogies but instead have two wheelsets.\n\n== Grovers bogie ==\n\nTwo-axle cars operating on lines with sharp curves, such as [[Queensland Railways]], used Grovers bogies.<ref>[http://tdu.to/150539.msg  Grovers bogie]</ref><ref>[http://www.westonlangford.com/images/photo/100889/  Grovers Bogie under 4 wheel wagon]</ref><ref>[http://www.zelmeroz.com/album_rail/qld/jf72/jf_x08.jpg Drawing of Govers Bogie wagon]</ref>\n\n== Special wheelsets ==\n[[File:Bogie-metro-Meteor-p1010692.jpg|thumb|[[Bogie]] from an [[MP 89]] [[Paris M\u00e9tro]] rolling stock showing the two special wheelsets]]\n[[Rubber-tyred metro]]s feature special wheelsets with [[rubber]] [[tire|tyre]]s outside of the special flanged steel wheels. The unusually large flanges on the steel wheels guide the bogie through standard [[railroad switch]]es and in addition keep the train from [[derailment|derailing]] in case the tires deflate.\n\n== Semi-conical shape ==\nMost [[train wheel|train wheels]] have a semi-[[cone (mathematics)|conical]] taper of about 1 in 20.  The semi-conical shape helps steer the wheel set around [[Civil engineering#Surveying|curves]], so that the wheel [[flange|flanges]] do not come in contact with the rail sides. The rails generally slant inwards at the same rate as the wheel [[Tire uniformity#Conicity|conicity]].  As the wheels approach a curve, they tend to continue in a straight path due to the [[inertia]] of the rail car. This inertia makes the wheel set to shift sideways as the track curves under it. Due to this fact, the effective diameter of the outer wheels needs to be greater than that of the inner ones. Since the wheels are joined rigidly by the axle, the outer wheels travel farther, then causing the train to naturally follow the curve. For more information on this process, see [[Hunting oscillation]].\n\nQueensland Railways, for its first hundred years, used cylindrical wheels and vertical rails.<ref>J W Knowles, Radial Wheeled Rolling Stock on the Queensland Railways, Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, Vol XXV, No 438, April 1974, pp 75 \u2013 92;</ref><ref>John Knowles, The Queensland Railways and its Cylindrical Wheels,Sunshine Express, Vol 17, No. 189., December 1981, p 241.</ref><ref>John Knowles, More on the Queensland Railways and its Cylindrical Wheels,Sunshine Express, Vol 19, No. 210, September 1983, p 210.></ref> With non-inclined rails and cylindrical wheels, the wheel squeal from trains taking curves on that railway was slight. After adopting coned wheels and inclined rails from the mid 1980s, the wheel squeal from trains curving at the same location and at the same speed increased immensely.  Some modern systems, such as [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] (BART) in [[San Francisco]], use cylindrical wheels and flat-topped rails.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=center widths=185 heights=120>\nFile:GWR Spoked wagon wheels.jpg|A wheelset from a [[Great Western Railway|GWR]] wagon, showing a [[plain bearing]] end\nFile:Bettendorf truck at Illinois Railway Museum.JPG|Two wheelsets with [[journal box]]es in a North American ([[William P.
