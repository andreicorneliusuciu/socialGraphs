DMAIC is a data-driven quality strategy used to ''improve'' processes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/six-sigma/overview/dmaic.html|title=Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control (DMAIC Approach) - ASQ|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nQuality assurance comprises administrative and procedural activities implemented in a [[quality system]] so that requirements and goals for a product, service or activity will be fulfilled.<ref name=\"asq.org\"/> It is the systematic measurement, comparison with a standard, monitoring of processes and an associated feedback loop that confers error prevention.<ref>The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board]] (MASB) endorses this definition as part of its ongoing [http://www.commonlanguage.wikispaces.net/ Common Language in Marketing Project].</ref> This can be contrasted with [[quality control]], which is focused on process output.\n\nTwo principles included in quality assurance are: \"Fit for purpose\" (the product should be suitable for the intended purpose); and \"right first time\" (mistakes should be eliminated). QA includes management of the [[Quality (business)|quality]] of raw materials, assemblies, products and components, services related to production, and [[management]], production and [[inspection]] processes.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nSuitable quality is determined by [[Product (business)|product]] users, clients or [[customer]]s, not by [[society]] in general. It is not related to cost, and adjectives or descriptors such as \"high\" and \"poor\" are not applicable. For example, a low priced product may be viewed as having high quality because it is disposable, whereas another may be viewed as having poor quality because it is not disposable.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n== History==\n\n=== Initial efforts to control the quality of production ===\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], [[guild]]s adopted responsibility for the quality of goods and services offered by their members, setting and maintaining certain standards for guild membership.<ref>[http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/history-of-quality/overview/overview.html ASQ \u2013 History of Quality]. Accessed 17 November 2014</ref>\n\nRoyal governments purchasing material were interested in [[quality control]] as customers. For this reason, King [[John of England]] appointed William Wrotham to report about the construction and repair of ships{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. Centuries later, [[Samuel Pepys]], Secretary to the British [[Admiralty]], appointed multiple such overseers{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.\n\nPrior to the extensive [[division of labor]] and [[mechanization]] resulting from the [[Industrial Revolution]], it was possible for workers to control the quality of their own products. The [[Industrial Revolution]] led to a system in which large groups of people performing a specialized type of work were grouped together under the supervision of a foreman who was appointed to control the quality of work manufactured.\n\n=== Wartime production ===\n\nDuring the time of the [[World War I|First World War]], manufacturing processes typically became more complex with larger numbers of workers being supervised. This period saw the widespread introduction of [[mass production]] and [[piece work]], which created problems as workmen could now earn more money by the production of extra [[product (business)|products]], which in turn occasionally led to poor quality workmanship being passed on to the [[assembly line]]s. To counter bad workmanship, full-time [[inspector]]s were introduced to identify, quarantine and ideally correct product quality failures. Quality control by inspection in the 1920s and 1930s led to the growth of quality inspection functions{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, separately organized from production and large enough to be headed by [[Superintendent (construction)|superintendents]].\n\nThe systematic approach to quality started in industrial manufacturing during the 1930s{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, mostly in the U.S.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, when some attention was given to the cost of [[scrap]] and [[rework (electronics)|rework]]. The impact of [[mass production]] required during the [[Second World War]] made it necessary{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} to introduce an improved form of quality control known as [[Statistical Quality Control]], or SQC. Some of the initial work for SQC is credited to [[Walter A. Shewhart]] of [[Bell Labs]], starting with his famous one-page memorandum of 1924.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.\n\nSQC includes the concept that every production piece cannot be fully inspected into acceptable and non-acceptable batches. By extending the inspection phase and making inspection organizations more efficient, it provides inspectors with control tools such as [[Theoretical sampling|sampling]] and [[control chart]]s, even where 100 percent inspection is not practicable. Standard statistical techniques allow the producer to sample and test a certain proportion of the products for quality to achieve the desired level of confidence in the quality of the entire batch or production run.\n\n=== Postwar ===\n\nIn the period following World War II, many countries' manufacturing capabilities that had been destroyed during the war were rebuilt.  [[General Douglas MacArthur]] oversaw the re-building of [[Japan]]. During this time, General MacArthur involved{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} two key individuals in the development of modern quality concepts:  [[W. Edwards Deming]] and [[Joseph Juran]]. Both individuals promoted the collaborative concepts of quality to Japanese business and technical groups, and these groups utilized these concepts in the redevelopment of the Japanese economy.\n\nAlthough there were many individuals trying to lead United States industries towards a more comprehensive approach to quality, the U.S. continued to apply the Quality Control (QC) concepts of inspection and sampling to remove defective product from production lines, essentially ignoring advances in QA for decades{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.\n\n== Approaches ==\n\n=== Failure testing ===\n\nA valuable process to perform on a whole [[consumer]] product is failure testing or [[stress testing]]. In mechanical terms this is the operation of a product until it fails, often under stresses such as increasing [[vibration]], [[temperature]], and [[humidity]]. This exposes many unanticipated [[weakness]]es in a product, and the data is used to drive engineering and manufacturing process improvements. Often quite simple changes can dramatically improve product service, such as changing to [[mold]]-resistant [[paint]] or adding [[Washer (hardware)#Spring and locking washers|lock-washer]] placement to the [[training]] for new assembly personnel.\n\n=== Statistical control ===\n\nStatistical control is based on analyses of objective and subjective data.<ref name=\"flexstudy-9561a\">Evans, James R. (1994) [http://www.flexstudy.com/catalog/schpdf.cfm?coursenum=9561a Introduction to Statistical Process Control] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203204/http://www.flexstudy.com/catalog/schpdf.cfm?coursenum=9561a |date=October 29, 2013 }}, ''Fundamentals of Statistical Process Control'', pp 1\u201313</ref> Many organizations use [[statistical process control]] as a tool in any quality improvement effort<ref>http://www.nctr.usf.edu/jpt/pdf/JPT%208-2%20Smith_Chaudhry.pdf</ref> to track quality data. Any product can be statistically charted as long as they have a common cause variance or special cause variance to track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/statistical-process-control/overview/overview.html|title=Statistical Process Control & Process Control Tools - ASQ|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nWalter Shewart of Bell Telephone Laboratories recognized that when a product is made, data can be taken from scrutinized areas of a sample lot of the part and statistical variances are then analyzed and charted. Control can then be implemented on the part in the form of rework or scrap, or control can be implemented on the process that made the part, ideally eliminating the defect before more parts can be made like it.<ref name=\"flexstudy-9561a\"/>\n\n=== Total quality management ===\n{{main|Total Quality Management}}\nThe quality of products is dependent upon that of the participating constituents,<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Thareja\n  | first = Mannu\n  | authorlink=\n  |author2=Thareja, Priyavrat\n   | title = The Quality Brilliance Through Brilliant People\n  | journal = Quality World\n  | volume =  4\n  | issue =  2\n  | pages =\n  | date = February 2007\n  | url = http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1498550\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | accessdate = 2010-01-11\n}}</ref> some of which are sustainable and effectively controlled while others are not. The process(es) which are managed with QA pertain to [[Total Quality Management]].\n\nIf the specification does not reflect the true quality requirements, the product's quality cannot be guaranteed. For instance, the parameters for a pressure vessel should cover not only the material and [[dimension]]s but operating, environmental, [[safety]], [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] and [[maintainability]] requirements.\n\n=== Models and standards ===\n\n[[ISO 17025]] is an [[international standard]] that specifies the general requirements for the competence to carry out tests and or [[calibration]]s. There are 15 management requirements and 10 technical requirements. These requirements outline what a laboratory must do to become accredited.\nManagement system refers to the organization's structure for managing its processes or activities that transform inputs of resources into a product or service which meets\nthe organization's objectives, such as satisfying the customer's quality requirements, complying with regulations, or meeting environmental objectives. WHO has developed several tools and offers training courses for quality assurance in public health laboratories. <ref>The World Health Organization, Public Health Laboratory Quality Assurance: tools and training. http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Health-systems/laboratory-services/quality-tools-and-training</ref> \n\nThe [[Capability Maturity Model Integration]] ([[CMMI]]) model is widely used to implement Process and Product Quality Assurance (PPQA) in an organization. The CMMI maturity levels can be divided into 5 steps, which a company can achieve by performing specific activities within the organization.\n\n=== Company quality ===\n\nDuring the 1980s, the concept of \"company quality\" with the focus on [[management]] and [[people]] came to the fore.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} It was realized that, if all [[Departmentalization|departments]] approached quality with an open mind, success was possible if the management led the quality [[:wikt:improvement|improvement]] process.\n\nThe company-wide quality approach places an emphasis on four aspects{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} :-\n# Elements such as controls, job management, adequate processes, performance and integrity criteria and identification of records\n# Competence such as knowledge, skills, experiences, qualifications\n# Soft elements, such as personnel [[integrity]], [[confidence]], [[organizational culture]], [[motivation]], [[team spirit]] and quality relationships.\n# Infrastructure (as it enhances or limits functionality)\n\nThe quality of the outputs is at risk if any of these aspects is deficient.\n\nQA is not limited to manufacturing, and can be applied to any business or non-business activity, including: design, consulting, banking, insurance, computer software development, retailing, investment, transportation, education, and translation.\n\nIt comprises a quality improvement process, which is generic in the sense that it can be applied to any of these activities and it establishes a [[behavior pattern]], which supports the achievement of quality.\n\nThis in turn is supported by quality management practices which can include a number of [[business system]]s and which are usually specific to the activities of the [[business unit]] concerned.\n\nIn manufacturing and [[construction]] activities, these business practices can be equated to the models for quality assurance defined by the International Standards contained in the [[ISO 9000]] series and the specified [[Specification]]s for quality systems.\n\nIn the system of Company Quality, the work being carried out was shop floor inspection which did not reveal the major quality problems. This led to quality assurance or total quality control, which has come into being recently.\n\n== In practice ==\n\n===Medical industry ===\nQA is very important in the medical field because it helps to identify the standards of medical equipments and services. Hospitals and laboratories make use of external agencies in order to ensure standards for equipment such as X-ray machines, Diagnostic Radiology and AERB.\n\n===Software development ===\n{{main|Software quality assurance}}Software Quality Assurance consists of a means of monitoring the [[software engineering]] processes and methods used to ensure quality. The methods by which this is accomplished are many and varied, and may include ensuring conformance to one or more standards, such as [[ISO 9000]] or a model such as [[CMMI]]. In addition, enterprise quality management software is used to correct issues such as: supply chain disaggregation and [[regulatory compliance]] which are vital among [[medical device]] manufacturers.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.slideshare.net/spartasystems/managing-quality-across-the-enterprise|title = Managing Quality Across the Enterprise: Enterprise Quality Management Solution for Medical Device Companies|date = 2015-02-02 |publisher = Sparta Systems}}</ref>\n\n=== Using contractors and/or consultants ===\n\n[[Consultant]]s and contractors are sometimes employed when introducing new quality practices and methods, particularly where the relevant skills and expertise are not available within the organization or when allocating the available internal resources are not available. Consultants and contractors will often employ Quality Management Systems (QMS), auditing and procedural documentation writing [[CMMI]], [[Six Sigma]], [[Measurement Systems Analysis]] (MSA), [[Quality Function Deployment]] (QFD), [[Failure Mode and Effects Analysis]] (FMEA), and [[Advance Product Quality Planning]] (APQP).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Best practice]]\n* [[Data quality]]\n* [[Data integrity]]\n* [[Farm assurance]]\n* [[GxP]], a general term for Good Practice quality guidelines and regulations\n* [[ISO 9000]]\n* [[Mission assurance]]\n* [[Production assurance]]\n* [[Program assurance]]\n* [[QA/QC]]\n* [[Quality engineering]]\n* [[Quality infrastructure]]\n* [[Quality management]]\n* [[Quality management system]]\n* [[Ringtest]], part of a quality assurance program in which identical samples are analyzed by different laboratories\n* [[Software testing]]\n* [[Software quality assurance]] \n* [[Total quality management]]\n* [[Verification and validation]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading==\n\n=== Journals ===\n* [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/15634/home The Quality Assurance Journal], {{ISSN|1087-8378}}, [[John Wiley & Sons]]\n* [http://www.asq.org/qualityprogress/index.html QP \u2013 Quality Progress magazine], Published by the [[American Society for Quality]]\n* [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/products/journals/journals.htm?id=qae Quality Assurance in Education], {{ISSN|0968-4883}}, [[Emerald Publishing Group]]\n* [http://www.springerlink.com/content/q922ehvpaq49pw6q/ Accreditation and Quality Assurance: Journal for Quality, Comparability and Reliability in Chemical Measurement], {{ISSN|0949-1775}} Print, {{ISSN|1432-0517}}\n* [http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/405859/description Food Quality and Preference], {{ISSN|0950-3293}}\n* [http://www.asigurareacalitatii.ro/ Asigurarea Calitatii - Quality Assurance], {{ISSN|1224-5410}}\n\n=== Issues ===\n*Almeida, E., Alvaro, A., Meria, S.
