The sprung weight typically includes the body, frame, the internal components, passengers, and [[cargo]], but does not include the mass of the components suspended below the suspension components (including the [[wheel]]s, wheel bearings, brake rotors, calipers, and/or [[Continuous track]]s (Also called caterpillar tracks), if any), which are part of the vehicle's [[unsprung weight]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Sprung mass and Unsprung mass|url=http://www.zigwheels.com/news-features/auto-insight/sprung-mass-and-unsprung-mass/9188/1|publisher=ZigWheels|accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe larger the ratio of sprung weight to [[unsprung weight]], the less the body and vehicle occupants are affected by bumps, dips, and other surface imperfections such as small bridges. However, a large sprung weight to unsprung weight ratio can also be deleterious to vehicle control.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sprung Mass}}\n[[Category:Mass]]\n[[Category:Automotive suspension technologies]]\n\n{{Automotive-tech-stub}}"}]}}}}
