It is commonly used by scientists, mathematicians and engineers, in part because it can simplify certain [[arithmetic operations]].

In [[#Normalized notation|normalized notation]], the exponent is chosen so that the absolute value of the coefficient is at least one but less than ten.\n\n[[Decimal floating point]] is a computer arithmetic system closely related to scientific notation.\n\n==Normalized notation==\n<!-- linked to -->\n{{main|Normalized number}}\nAny given integer can be written in the form {{gaps|''m''|e=''n''}} in many ways: for example, 350 can be written as {{val|3.5|e=2}} or {{val|35|e=1}} or {{val|350|e=0}}.<!-- \"any given number\" includes irrational numbers, which can't -->\n\nIn ''normalized'' scientific notation (called \"standard form\" in the UK), the exponent ''n'' is chosen so that the [[absolute value]] of ''m'' remains at least one but less than ten (1&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;|''m''|&nbsp;<&nbsp;10). Thus 350 is written as {{val|3.5|e=2}}. This form allows easy comparison of numbers, as the exponent ''n'' gives the number's [[order of magnitude]]. In normalized notation, the exponent ''n'' is negative for a number with absolute value between 0 and 1 (e.g. 0.5 is written as {{val|5|e=-1}}). The 10 and exponent are often omitted when the exponent is 0.\n\nNormalized scientific form is the typical form of expression of large numbers in many fields, unless an unnormalized form, such as [[engineering notation]], is desired. Normalized scientific notation is often called '''[[exponentiation|exponential]] notation'''\u2014although the latter term is more general and also applies when ''m'' is not restricted to the range 1 to 10 (as in engineering notation for instance) and to [[base (exponentiation)|base]]s other than 10 (as in {{gaps|3.15|base=\u20092|e=20}}).\n\n==Engineering notation==\n{{Main|Engineering notation}}\nEngineering notation (often named \"ENG\" display mode on scientific calculators) differs from normalized scientific notation in that the exponent ''n'' is restricted to [[multiple (mathematics)|multiples]] of 3. Consequently, the absolute value of ''m'' is in the range 1 \u2264 |''m''| < 1000, rather than 1 \u2264 |''m''| < 10. Though similar in concept, engineering notation is rarely called scientific notation. Engineering notation allows the numbers to explicitly match their corresponding [[SI prefixes]], which facilitates reading and oral communication. For example, {{val|12.5|e=-9|u=m}} can be read as \"twelve-point-five nanometers\" and written as {{val|12.5|u=nm}}, while its scientific notation equivalent {{val|1.25|e=-8|u=m}} would likely be read out as \"one-point-two-five times ten-to-the-negative-eight meters\".\n\n==Significant figures==\n{{Main|Significant figures}}\nA significant figure is a digit in a number that adds to its precision. This includes all nonzero numbers, zeroes between significant digits, and zeroes [[Significant figures#Identifying significant digits|indicated to be significant]].\nLeading and trailing zeroes are not significant because they exist only to show the scale of the number. Therefore, 1,230,400 usually has five significant figures: 1, 2, 3, 0, and 4; the final two zeroes serve only as placeholders and add no precision to the original number.\n\nWhen a number is converted into normalized scientific notation, it is scaled down to a number between 1 and 10. All of the significant digits remain, but the place holding zeroes are no longer required. Thus 1,230,400 would become 1.2304&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>. However, there is also the possibility that the number may be known to six or more significant figures, in which case the number would be shown as (for instance) 1.23040&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>. Thus, an additional advantage of scientific notation is that the number of significant figures is clearer.\n\n===Estimated final digit(s)===\nIt is customary in scientific measurements to record all the definitely known digits from the measurements, and to estimate at least one additional digit if there is any information at all available to enable the observer to make an estimate. The resulting number contains more information than it would without that extra digit(s), and it (or they) may be considered a significant digit because it conveys some information leading to greater precision in measurements and in aggregations of measurements (adding them or multiplying them together).\n\nAdditional information about precision can be conveyed through additional notations. It is often useful to know how exact the final digit(s) are. For instance, the accepted value of the unit of elementary charge can properly be expressed as {{val|1.602176487|(40)|e=-19|ul=C}},<ref name=\"cuu-e\">{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?e |title=NIST value for the elementary charge |publisher=Physics.nist.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref> which is shorthand for {{val|1.602176487|0.000000040|e=-19|u=C}}\n\n=={{anchor|E notation}}E notation==\n[[Image:Avogadro's number in e notation.jpg|thumb|upright|A calculator display showing the [[Avogadro constant]] in E notation]]\n\nMost [[calculator]]s and many [[computer program]]s present very large and very small results in scientific notation, typically invoked by a key labelled {{button|EXP}} (for ''exponent''), {{button|EEX}} (for ''enter exponent''), {{button|EE}}, {{button|EX}}, or {{button|E}} depending on vendor and model. Because [[subscript and superscript|superscripted]] exponents like 10<sup>7</sup> cannot always be conveniently displayed, the letter ''E'' or ''e'' is often used to represent \"times ten raised to the power of\" (which would be written as \"\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>''n''</sup>\") and is followed by the value of the exponent; in other words, for any two real numbers ''m'' and ''n'', the usage of \"mEn\" would indicate a value of ''m'' \u00d7 10<sup>''n''</sup>. In this usage the character ''e'' is not related to the [[e (mathematical constant)|mathematical constant ''e'']] or the [[exponential function]] ''e''<sup>''x''</sup> (a confusion that is unlikely if scientific notation is represented by a capital ''E''). Although the ''E'' stands for ''exponent'', the notation is usually referred to as ''(scientific) E notation'' or ''(scientific) e notation'', rather than ''(scientific) exponential notation''. The use of E notation facilitates data entry and readability in textual communication since it minimizes keystrokes, avoids reduced font sizes and provides a simpler and more concise display, but it is not encouraged in publications.<ref>{{Citation|last=Edwards |first=John |year=2009 |title=Submission Guidelines for Authors: HPS 2010 Midyear Proceedings |publisher=Health Physics Society |publication-place=[[McLean, Virginia]] |page=5 |url=http://hps.org/documents/2010_midyear_author-submission-guidelines.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-03-30 }}</ref>\n\n===Examples and other notations ===\n* In most popular programming languages, <code>6.022E23</code> or <code>6.022e23</code> is equivalent to [[Avogadro constant|{{val|6.022|e=23}}]], and [[Planck length|{{val|1.6|e=-35}}]] would be written <code>1.6e-35</code> (e.g. [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Analytica (software)|Analytica]], [[C++]], [[Fortran|FORTRAN]], [[MATLAB]], [[Scilab]], [[Perl]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html |title=Primitive Data Types (The Java Tutorials > Learning the Java Language > Language Basics) |publisher=Download.oracle.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref> [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] and [[JavaScript]].)\n* FORTRAN also uses \"D\" to signify double precision numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.hawaii.edu/lab/197/fortran/fort3.htm#double |title=UH M\u0101noa Mathematics \u00bb Fortran lesson 3: Format, Write, etc |publisher=Math.hawaii.edu |date=2012-02-12 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref>\n* The [[ALGOL|ALGOL 60]] programming language uses a subscript ten \"<sub>10</sub>\" character instead of the letter E, for example: {{nowrap begin}}<code lang=\"ALGOL\">6.0221415<sub>10</sub>23</code>{{nowrap end}}.<ref>Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60, Ed.

A [[proton]]'s mass is {{val|0.0000000000000000000000000016726|u=kg}}. If written as {{val|1.6726|e=-27|u=kg}}, it is easier to compare this mass with that of an electron, given below.  The [[order of magnitude]] of the ratio of the masses can be obtained by comparing the exponents instead of the more error-prone task of counting the leading zeros.  In this case, \u221227 is larger than \u221231 and therefore the proton is roughly four orders of magnitude ({{val|10000|fmt=commas}} times) more massive than the electron.\n\nScientific notation also avoids misunderstandings due to regional differences in certain quantifiers, such as ''[[Long and short scales|billion]]'', which might indicate either 10<sup>9</sup> or 10<sup>12</sup>.\n\nIn physics and astrophysics, the number of orders of magnitude between two numbers is sometimes referred to as \"dex\", a contraction of \"decimal exponent\". For instance, if two numbers are within 1&nbsp;dex of each other, then the ratio of the larger to the smaller number is less than 10. Fractional values can be used, so if within 0.5&nbsp;dex, the ratio is less than {{sqrt|10}}, and so on.\n\n==Use of spaces==\nIn normalized scientific notation, in E notation, and in engineering notation, the [[Space (punctuation)|space]] (which in [[typesetting]] may be represented by a normal width space or a [[thin space]]) that is allowed ''only'' before and after \"\u00d7\" or in front of \"E\" or \"e\" is sometimes omitted, though it is less common to do so before the alphabetical character.<ref>Samples of usage of terminology and variants:  [http://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/bitstream/1912/665/1/WHOI-76-59.pdf], [http://www.brookscole.com/physics_d/templates/student_resources/003026961X_serway/review/expnot.html], [http://www.brynmawr.edu/nsf/tutorial/ss/ssnot.html], [http://www.lasalle.edu/~smithsc/Astronomy/Units/sci_notation.html], [http://www.gnsphysics.com/mathreview.pdf], [http://www.ttinet.com/doc/language_v44_003.html#heading_3.2.4.2]</ref>\n\n==Further examples of scientific notation==\n*An [[electron]]'s mass is about {{gaps|0.000|000|000|000|000|000|000|000|000|000|910|938|22}}&nbsp;kg. In scientific notation, this is written {{val|9.1093822|e=-31|u=kg}} (in SI units).\n*The [[Earth]]'s [[mass]] is about {{gaps|5|973|600|000|000|000|000|000|000}}&nbsp;kg. In scientific notation, this is written {{val|5.9736|e=24|u=kg}}.\n* The [[Earth#Shape|Earth's circumference]] is approximately {{gaps|40|000|000}}&nbsp;m. In scientific notation, this is {{val|4|e=7|u=m}}. In engineering notation, this is written {{val|40|e=6|u=m}}. In [[International System of Units|SI writing style]], this may be written \"{{val|40|u=Mm}}\" (''40 megameters'').\n* An [[inch]] is defined as ''exactly'' 25.4&nbsp;mm (so the number of significant digits is actually infinite). Quoting a value of 25.400&nbsp;mm shows that the value is correct to the nearest micrometer. An approximated value with only three significant digits would be {{val|2.54|e=1|u=mm}} instead. As there is no limit to the number of significant digits, the length of an inch could, if required, be written as (say) {{val|2.54000000000|e=1|u=mm}} instead.\n\n==Converting numbers==\nConverting a number in these cases means to either convert the number into scientific notation form, convert it back into decimal form or to change the exponent part of the equation. None of these alter the actual number, only how it's expressed.\n\n===Decimal to scientific===\nFirst, move the decimal separator point the required amount, ''n'', to make the number's value within a desired range, between 1 and 10 for normalized notation. If the decimal was moved to the left, append \"\u00d7&nbsp;10''<sup>n</sup>''\"; to the right, \"\u00d7&nbsp;10''<sup>\u2212n</sup>''\". To represent the number {{val|1230400|fmt=commas}} in normalized scientific notation, the decimal separator would be moved 6 digits to the left and \"\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>\" appended, resulting in {{val|1.2304|e=6}}. The number {{val|-0.0040321}} would have its decimal separator shifted 3 digits to the right instead of the left and yield {{val|-4.0321|e=-3}} as a result.\n\n===Scientific to decimal===\nConverting a number from scientific notation to decimal notation, first remove the ''\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>n</sup>'' on the end, then shift the decimal separator ''n'' digits to the right (positive ''n'') or left (negative ''n''). The number {{val|1.2304|e=6}} would have its decimal separator shifted 6 digits to the right and become {{val|1230400|fmt=commas}}, while {{val|-4.0321|e=-3}} would have its decimal separator moved 3 digits to the left and be {{gaps|-0.004|0321}}.\n\n=== Exponential===\nConversion between different scientific notation representations of the same number with different exponential values is achieved by performing opposite operations of multiplication or division by a power of ten on the significand and an subtraction or addition of one on the exponent part. The decimal separator in the significand is shifted ''x'' places to the left (or right) and ''x'' is added to (or subtracted from) the exponent, as shown below.\n\n: {{val|1.234|e=3}} = {{val|12.34|e=2}} = {{val|123.4|e=1}} = 1234\n\n==Basic operations==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Addition]] -->\nGiven two numbers in scientific notation,\n\n:<math>x_0=m_0\\times10^{n_0}</math>\nand\n:<math>x_1=m_1\\times10^{n_1}</math>\n\n[[Multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]] are performed using the rules for operation with [[exponentiation]]:\n\n:<math>x_0 x_1=m_0 m_1\\times10^{n_0+n_1}</math>\nand\n:<math>\\frac{x_0}{x_1}=\\frac{m_0}{m_1}\\times10^{n_0-n_1}</math>\n\nSome examples are:\n:<math>5.67\\times10^{-5} \\times 2.34\\times10^2 \\approx 13.3\\times10^{-3} = 1.33\\times10^{-2}  </math>\nand\n:<math>\\frac{2.34\\times10^2}{5.67\\times10^{-5}}  \\approx 0.413\\times10^{7} = 4.13\\times10^6  </math>\n\n[[Addition]] and [[subtraction]] require the numbers to be represented using the same exponential part, so that the significand can be simply added or subtracted. :<math>x_1 = m_1 \\times10^{n_1}</math> with <math>n_0 = n_1</math>\n\nNext, add or subtract the significands:\n\n:<math>x_0 \\pm x_1=(m_0\\pm m_1)\\times10^{n_0}</math>\n\nAn example:\n\n:<math>2.34\\times10^{-5} + 5.67\\times10^{-6} = 2.34\\times10^{-5} + 0.567\\times10^{-5} = 2.907\\times10^{-5}</math>\n\n==Other bases==\nWhile base ten is normally used for scientific notation, powers of other bases can be used too, base 2 being the next most commonly used one.\n\nFor example, in base-2 scientific notation, the number 1001<sub>b</sub> in [[binary numeral system|binary]] (=9<sub>d</sub>) is written as \n1.001<sub>b</sub>&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2<sub>d</sub><sup>11<sub>b</sub></sup> or 1.001<sub>b</sub>&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sub>b</sub><sup>11<sub>b</sub></sup> using binary numbers (or shorter 1.001&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>11</sup> if binary context is clear). In E-notation, this is written as 1.001<sub>b</sub>E11<sub>b</sub> (or shorter: 1.001E11) with the letter ''E'' now standing for \"times two (10<sub>b</sub>) to the power\" here. In order to better distinguish this base-2 exponent from a base-10 exponent, a base-2 exponent is sometimes also indicated by using the letter ''B'' instead of ''E'',<ref name=\"HP16C-Lib\"/> a shorthand notation originally proposed by [[Bruce Alan Martin]] of [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] in 1968,<ref name=\"Martin_1968\">{{cite journal | title=Letters to the editor: On binary notation | first=Bruce Alan | last=Martin | publisher=[[Associated Universities Inc.]] | work=[[Communications of the ACM]] | volume=11 | issue=10 | date=October 1968 | page=658 | doi=10.1145/364096.364107}}</ref> as in 1.001<sub>b</sub>B11<sub>b</sub> (or shorter: 1.001B11).
