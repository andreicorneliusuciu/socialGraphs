During the [[early modern period]], scientists such as [[Omar Khayyam|Khayaam]], [[Galileo]], [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], laid the foundation for what is now known as [[classical mechanics]].\nIt is a branch of classical physics that deals with particles that are either at rest or are moving with velocities significantly less than the speed of light. \nIt can also be defined as a branch of science which deals with the motion of and forces on objects.\n\n== Classical versus quantum mechanics ==\n{{Classical mechanics |branches}}\n{{Quantum mechanics |background}}\n\nHistorically, [[classical mechanics]] came first, while [[quantum mechanics]] is a comparatively recent invention. Classical mechanics originated with [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] in [[Philosophic Naturalist Principal Mathematical|''Principal Mathematical'']]; Quantum Mechanics was discovered in the early 20th century. Both are commonly held to constitute the most certain knowledge that exists about physical nature. Classical mechanics has especially often been viewed as a model for other so-called [[exact science]]s. Essential in this respect is the relentless use of [[mathematics]] in theories, as well as the decisive role played by [[experiment]] in generating and testing them.\n\n[[Quantum]] mechanics is of a bigger  scope, as it encompasses classical mechanics as a sub-discipline which applies under certain restricted circumstances. According to the [[correspondence principle]], there is no contradiction or conflict between the two subjects, each simply pertains to specific situations. The correspondence principle states that the behavior of systems described by quantum theories reproduces classical physics in the limit of large quantum numbers. Quantum mechanics has superseded classical mechanics at the foundation level and is indispensable for the explanation and prediction of processes at the molecular, atomic, and sub-atomic level. However, for macroscopic processes classical mechanics is able to solve problems which are unmanageable difficult in quantum mechanics and hence remains useful and well used.\nModern descriptions of such behavior begin with a careful definition of such quantities as displacement (distance moved), time, velocity, acceleration, mass, and force. Until about 400 years ago, however, motion was explained from a very different point of view. For example, following the ideas of Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle, scientists reasoned that a cannonball falls down because its natural position is in the Earth; the sun, the moon, and the stars travel in circles around the earth because it is the nature of heavenly objects to travel in perfect circles.\n\nOften cited as the father of modern science, [[Galileo]] brought together the ideas of other great thinkers of his time and began to analyze motion in terms of distance traveled from some starting position and the time that it took. He showed that the speed of falling objects increases steadily during the time of their fall. This acceleration is the same for heavy objects as for light ones, provided air friction (air resistance) is discounted. The English mathematician and physicist Isaac Newton improved this analysis by defining force and mass and relating these to acceleration. For objects traveling at speeds close to the speed of light, Newton\u2019s laws were superseded by Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity. For atomic and subatomic particles, Newton\u2019s laws were superseded by quantum theory. For everyday phenomena, however, Newton\u2019s three laws of motion remain the cornerstone of dynamics, which is the study of what causes motion.\n\n== Relativistic versus Newtonian mechanics ==\n\nIn analogy to the distinction between quantum and classical mechanics, [[Einstein]]'s [[General relativity|general]] and [[Special relativity|special]] theories of [[theory of relativity|relativity]] have expanded the scope of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Galileo]]'s formulation of mechanics. The differences between relativistic and Newtonian mechanics become significant and even dominant as the velocity of a massive body approaches the [[speed of light]]. For instance, in [[classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]], [[Newton's laws of motion]] specify that '''F''' = ''m'''''a''', whereas in [[Relativistic mechanics]] and [[Lorentz transformations]], which were first discovered by [[Hendrik Lorentz]], '''F''' = &gamma;''m'''''a''' (where \u03b3 is the [[Lorentz factor]], which is almost equal to 1 for low speeds).\n\n==General relativistic versus quantum==\n\nRelativistic corrections are also needed for quantum mechanics, although general relativity has not been integrated. The two theories remain incompatible, a hurdle which must be overcome in developing a [[theory of everything]].\n\n==History==\n\n{{Main|History of classical mechanics|History of quantum mechanics}}\n\n===Antiquity===\n\n{{Main|Aristotelian mechanics}}\n\nThe main theory of mechanics in antiquity was [[Aristotelian mechanics]].<ref>\"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vPT-JubW-7QC&pg=PA19&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false A history of mechanics]''\".

Unknown date (at a guess: 16th to 19th centuries).]]\nIn the Middle Ages, Aristotle's theories were criticized and modified by a number of figures, beginning with [[John Philoponus]] in the 6th century. A central problem was that of [[projectile motion]], which was discussed by Hipparchus and Philoponus. This led to the development of the [[theory of impetus]] by 14th-century French priest [[Jean Buridan]], which developed into the modern theories of [[inertia]], [[velocity]], [[acceleration]] and [[momentum]]. This work and others was developed in 14th-century England by the [[Oxford Calculators]]  such as [[Thomas Bradwardine]], who studied and formulated various laws regarding falling bodies.\n\nOn the question of a body subject to a constant (uniform) force, the 12th-century Jewish-Arab [[Hibat Allah Abu'l-Barakat al-Baghdaadi|Nathanel]] (Iraqi, of Baghdad) stated that constant force imparts constant acceleration, while the main properties are uniformly accelerated motion (as of falling bodies) was worked out by the 14th-century Oxford Calculators.\n\n===Early modern age===\n\nTwo central figures in the early modern age are [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Isaac Newton]]. Galileo's final statement of his mechanics, particularly of falling bodies, is his ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' (1638). Newton's 1687 ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' provided a detailed mathematical account of mechanics, using the newly developed mathematics of [[calculus]] and providing the basis of [[Newtonian mechanics]].<ref name=\"mechanics\"/>\n\nThere is some dispute over priority of various ideas: Newton's ''Principia'' is certainly the seminal work and has been tremendously influential, and the systematic mathematics therein did not and could not have been stated earlier because calculus had not been developed. However, many of the ideas, particularly as pertain to inertia (impetus) and falling bodies had been developed and stated by earlier researchers, both the then-recent Galileo and the less-known medieval predecessors. Precise credit is at times difficult or contentious because scientific language and standards of proof changed, so whether medieval statements are ''equivalent'' to modern statements or ''sufficient'' proof, or instead ''similar'' to modern statements and ''hypotheses'' is often debatable.\n\n===Modern age===\n\nTwo main modern developments in mechanics are [[general relativity]] of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], and [[quantum mechanics]], both developed in the 20th century based in part on earlier 19th-century ideas. The development in the modern continuum mechanics, particularly in the areas of elasticity, plasticity, fluid dynamics, electrodynamics and thermodynamics of deformable media, started in the second half of the 20th century.\n\n==Types of mechanical bodies==\n\nThe often-used term '''[[Physical body|body]]''' needs to stand for a wide assortment of objects, including particles, [[projectiles]], [[spacecraft]], [[star]]s, parts of [[mechanical engineering|machinery]], parts of [[solids]], parts of [[fluids]] ([[gases]] and [[liquids]]), etc.\n\nOther distinctions between the various sub-disciplines of mechanics, concern the nature of the bodies being described. Particles are bodies with little (known) internal structure, treated as mathematical points in classical mechanics. Rigid bodies have size and shape, but retain a simplicity close to that of the particle, adding just a few so-called [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], such as orientation in space.\n\nOtherwise, bodies may be semi-rigid, i.e. [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]], or non-rigid, i.e. [[fluid]]. These subjects have both classical and quantum divisions of study.\n\nFor instance, the motion of a spacecraft, regarding its [[orbit]] and attitude ([[rotation]]), is described by the relativistic theory of classical mechanics, while the analogous movements of an [[atomic nucleus]] are described by quantum mechanics.\n\n== Sub-disciplines in mechanics ==\n\nThe following are two lists of various subjects that are studied in mechanics.\n\nNote that there is also the \"[[Field theory (physics)|theory of fields]]\" which constitutes a separate discipline in physics, formally treated as distinct from mechanics, whether [[Classical field theory|classical fields]] or [[quantum field theory|quantum fields]]. But in actual practice, subjects belonging to mechanics and fields are closely interwoven. Thus, for instance, forces that act on particles are frequently derived from fields ([[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] or [[gravitational]]), and particles generate fields by acting as sources. In fact, in quantum mechanics, particles themselves are fields, as described theoretically by the [[wave function]].\n\n=== Classical mechanics ===\n\n[[File:Newtonslawofgravity.ogg|thumb|Prof. [[Walter Lewin]] explains [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newton's law of gravitation]] in [http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-01-physics-i-classical-mechanics-fall-1999/video-lectures/lecture-11/ MIT course 8.01]<ref>\n{{cite video\n | people      = [[Walter Lewin]]   | date        = October 4, 1999\n | title       = Work, Energy, and Universal Gravitation.
