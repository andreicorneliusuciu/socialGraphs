It is a kind of uncontrolled [[positive feedback]].\n\nIn other words, \"thermal runaway\" describes a process which is accelerated by increased temperature, in turn releasing energy that further increases temperature. In [[chemistry]] (and [[chemical engineering]]), it is associated with strongly [[exothermic]] reactions that are accelerated by temperature rise. In [[electrical engineering]], thermal runaway is typically associated with increased current flow and power dissipation, although exothermic chemical reactions can be of concern here too. Thermal runaway can occur in [[civil engineering]], notably when the heat released by large amounts of [[Concrete#Curing|curing]] [[concrete]] is not controlled.  In [[astrophysics]], runaway [[nuclear fusion]] reactions in stars can lead to [[nova]] and several types of [[supernova]] explosions, and also occur as a less dramatic event in the normal evolution of solar mass stars, the \"[[helium flash]]\".\n\nThere are also concerns regarding [[global warming]] that a global average increase of [[4 Degrees and Beyond International Climate Conference|3-4 degrees Celsius]] above the preindustrial baseline could lead to a [[Runaway climate change|further unchecked increase]] in surface temperatures. For example, releases of [[Atmospheric methane|methane]], a [[greenhouse gas]] more potent than [[carbon dioxide#In the Earth's atmosphere|CO<sub>2</sub>]], from [[wetland]]s, melting [[permafrost]] and continental margin seabed [[Methane clathrate|clathrate]] deposits could be subject to [[Clathrate gun hypothesis|positive feedback]].<ref name=\"ccsp abrupt climate change\">\n{{Cite book\n | author=Clark, P.U.| date=December 2008\n | chapter=Executive Summary\n | title=Abrupt Climate Change.

It is also known as a '''runaway reaction''' in [[organic chemistry]].\n\nThermal explosion occurs when the [[reaction rate]] increases due to an increase in temperature, causing a further increase in temperature and hence a further rapid increase in the reaction rate. It has contributed to industrial [[chemical accidents]], most notably the 1947 [[Texas City disaster]] from overheated [[ammonium nitrate]] in a ship's hold, and the [[Bhopal disaster|disastrous release]] of a large volume of [[methyl isocyanate]] gas from a [[Union Carbide]] plant in [[Bhopal, India]] in 1984.\n\nMost chemical reactions produce some heat, so many industrial-scale and [[oil refinery]] processes have some level of risk of thermal runaway. These include [[hydrocracking#Hydrocracking|hydrocracking]], [[hydrogenation]], [[alkylation]] (S<sub>N</sub>2), [[oxidation]], [[metalation]] and [[nucleophilic aromatic substitution]]. For example, oxidation of [[cyclohexane]] into [[cyclohexanol]] and [[cyclohexanone]] and [[ortho-xylene]] into [[phthalic anhydride]] have led to catastrophic explosions when reaction control failed.\n\nThermal runaway may result from unwanted exothermic side reaction(s) that begin at higher temperatures, following an initial accidental overheating of the reaction mixture. This scenario was behind the [[Seveso disaster]], where thermal runaway heated a reaction to temperatures such that in addition to the intended 2,4,5-[[trichlorophenol]], poisonous [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxin|2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin]] was also produced, and was vented into the environment after the reactor's [[rupture disk]] burst.<ref name = \"Kletz\">{{cite book | last = Kletz | first = Trevor A. | authorlink = Trevor Kletz | title = Learning from Accidents | edition = 3rd | publisher = Gulf Professional | date = 2001 | location = Oxford U.K. | pages = 103\u20139 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zulmgUi5_aEC&pg=PA103&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=0_0#PPA73,M1 | isbn = 978-0-7506-4883-7}}</ref>\n\nThermal runaway is most often caused by failure of the [[chemical reactor|reactor]] vessel's [[Coolant|cooling]] system. Failure of the mixer can result in localized heating, which initiates thermal runaway. Similarly, in [[flow chemistry|flow reactors]], localized insufficient mixing causes hotspots to form, wherein thermal runaway conditions occur, which causes violent blowouts of reactor contents and catalysts. Incorrect equipment component installation is also a common cause. Many chemical production facilities are designed with high-volume emergency venting, a measure to limit the extent of injury and property damage when such accidents occur.\n\nAt large scale, it is unsafe to \"charge all reagents and mix\", as is done in laboratory scale. This is because the amount of reaction scales with the cube of the size of the vessel (V \u221d r\u00b3), but the heat transfer area scales with the square of the size (A \u221d r\u00b2), so that the heat production-to-area ratio scales with the size (V/A \u221d r). Consequently, reactions that easily cool fast enough in the laboratory can dangerously self-heat at ton scale. In 2007, this kind of erroneous procedure caused an explosion of a {{convert|2400|gal|liter}}-reactor used to [[Metalation|metalate]] [[methylcyclopentadiene]] with metallic [[sodium]], causing the loss of four lives and parts of the reactor being flung {{convert|400|ft|m}} away.<ref name=\"Lowe2009\">{{cite web|last1=Lowe|first1=Derek|authorlink1=Derek Lowe (chemist)|title=175 Times.

For example, in [[Swern oxidation]], the formation of  [[sulfonium]] chloride must be performed in a cooled system (\u201330&nbsp;\u00b0C), because at [[room temperature]] the reaction undergoes explosive thermal runaway.<ref name=\"Lowe2008\" />\n\nThe [[UK Chemical Reaction Hazards Forum]]<ref>[http://www.crhf.org.uk UK Chemical Reaction Hazards Forum]</ref> publishes analysis of previously-unreported [[chemical accidents]] to assist the education of the scientific and engineering community, with the aim of preventing similar occurrences elsewhere.  Almost 150 such reports are available to view as of January 2009.\n\n==Microwave heating==\n[[Microwave]]s are used for [[microwaving|heating]] of various materials in cooking and various industrial processes. The rate of heating of the material depends on the energy absorption, which depends on the [[dielectric constant]] of the material. The dependence of dielectric constant on temperature varies for different materials; some materials display significant increase with increasing temperature. This behavior, when the material gets exposed to microwaves, leads to selective local overheating, as the warmer areas are better able to accept further energy than the colder areas\u2014potentially dangerous especially for thermal insulators, where the heat exchange between the hot spots and the rest of the material is slow. These materials are called ''thermal runaway materials''. This phenomenon occurs in some [[ceramic materials|ceramics]].\n\n==Electrical engineering==\nSome electronic components develop lower resistances or lower triggering voltages (for nonlinear resistances) as their internal temperature increases. If circuit conditions cause markedly increased current flow in these situations, increased power [[dissipation]] may raise the temperature further by [[Joule heating]]. A [[vicious circle]] or [[positive feedback]] effect of thermal runaway can cause failure, sometimes in a spectacular fashion (e.g. electrical explosion or fire). To prevent these hazards, well-designed electronic systems typically incorporate current limiting protection, such as thermal fuses, circuit breakers, or [[temperature coefficient|PTC]] current limiters.\n\nTo handle larger currents, circuit designers may connect multiple lower-capacity devices (e.g. transistors, diodes, or MOVs) in [[parallel circuits|parallel]].  This technique can work well, but is susceptible to a phenomenon called '''current hogging''', in which the current is not shared equally across all devices.  Typically, one device may have a slightly lower resistance, and thus draws more current, heating it more than its sibling devices, causing its resistance to drop further.  The electrical load ends up funneling into a single device, which then rapidly fails.  Thus, an array of devices may end up no more robust than its weakest component.\n\nThe current-hogging effect can be reduced by carefully matching the characteristics of each paralleled device, or by using other design techniques to balance the electrical load. However, maintaining load balance under extreme conditions may not be straightforward.  Devices with an intrinsic [[positive temperature coefficient]] (PTC) of electrical resistance are less prone to current hogging, but thermal runaway can still occur because of poor heat sinking or other problems.\n\nMany electronic circuits contain special provisions to prevent thermal runaway. This is most often seen in transistor biasing arrangements for high-power output stages. However, when equipment is used above its designed ambient temperature, thermal runaway can still occur in some cases. This occasionally causes equipment failures in hot environments, or when [[air cooling]] vents are blocked.\n\n===Semiconductors===\n[[Silicon]] shows a peculiar profile, in that its [[electrical resistance]] increases with temperature up to about 160&nbsp;\u00b0C, then starts ''decreasing'', and drops further when the melting point is reached. This can lead to thermal runaway phenomena within internal regions of the [[semiconductor junction]]; the resistance decreases in the regions which become heated above this threshold, allowing more current to flow through the overheated regions, in turn causing yet more heating in comparison with the surrounding regions, which leads to further temperature increase and resistance decrease. This leads to the phenomenon of [[current crowding]] and formation of [[current filament]]s (similar to current hogging, but within a single device), and is one of the underlying causes of many [[Failure modes of electronics|semiconductor junction failures]].\n\n===Bipolar junction transistors (BJTs)===\n[[Leakage (semiconductors)|Leakage current]] increases significantly in [[bipolar transistor]]s (especially [[germanium]]-based bipolar transistors) as they increase in temperature. Depending on the design of the circuit, this increase in leakage current can increase the current flowing through a transistor and thus the [[power dissipation]], causing a further increase in collector-to-emitter leakage current. This is frequently seen in a [[push&ndash;pull output|push&ndash;pull]] stage of a [[electronic amplifier#Class AB amplifier|class AB amplifier]]. If the pull-up and pull-down transistors are [[bipolar transistor biasing|biased]] to have minimal [[crossover distortion]] at [[room temperature]], and the biasing is not temperature-compensated, then as the temperature rises both transistors will be increasingly biased on, causing current and power to further increase, and eventually destroying one or both devices.\n\nOne rule of thumb to avoid thermal runaway is to keep the [[Biasing|operating point]] of a BJT so that V<sub>ce</sub> \u2264 1/2V<sub>cc</sub>\n\nAnother practice is to mount a thermal feedback sensing transistor or other device on the heat sink, to control the crossover bias voltage. As the output transistors heat up, so does the thermal feedback transistor.  This in turn causes the thermal feedback transistor  to turn on at a slightly lower voltage,  reducing the crossover bias voltage, and so reducing the heat dissipated by the output transistors.\n\nIf multiple BJT transistors are connected in parallel (which is typical in high current applications), a current hogging problem can occur.  Special measures must be taken to control this characteristic vulnerability of BJTs.\n\nIn power transistors (which effectively consist of many small transistors in parallel), current hogging can occur between different parts of the transistor itself, with one part of the transistor becoming more hot than the others. This is called [[second breakdown]], and can result in destruction of the transistor even when the average junction temperature seems to be at a safe level.\n\n===Power MOSFETs===\nPower [[MOSFET]]s typically increase their on-resistance with temperature. Under some circumstances, power dissipated in this resistance causes more heating of the junction, which further increases the [[junction temperature]], in a [[positive feedback]] loop. As a consequence, power MOSFETs have stable and instable regions of operation.<ref name=\"powerMOSFETstability\">{{cite journal|last1=Ferrara|first1=A.|last2=Steeneken|first2=P.

If a MOSFET transistor produces more heat than the [[heatsink]] can dissipate, then thermal runaway can still destroy the transistors. This problem can be alleviated to a degree by lowering the [[thermal resistance]] between the transistor die and the heatsink. See also [[Thermal Design Power]].\n*[http://www.ipes.ethz.ch/ipes/2002thermal/runaway/runaway.html Java applet demo of MOSFET thermal runaway]\n\n===Metal oxide varistors (MOVs)===\nMetal oxide [[varistor]]s typically develop lower resistance as they heat up.  If connected directly across an AC or DC power bus (a common usage for protection against [[electrical transient]]s), a MOV which has developed a lowered trigger voltage can slide into catastrophic thermal runaway, possibly culminating in a small explosion or fire.<ref name=Brown2004>{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Kenneth|title=Metal Oxide Varistor Degradation|journal=IAEI Magazine|date=March 2004|url=http://www.iaei.org/magazine/2004/03/metal-oxide-varistor-degradation/|accessdate=2011-03-30}}</ref>   To prevent this possibility, fault current is typically limited by a thermal fuse, circuit breaker, or other current limiting device.\n\n===Tantalum capacitors===\n[[Tantalum capacitor]]s are under some conditions prone to self-destruction by thermal runaway. The capacitor typically consists of a [[sintering|sintered]] [[tantalum]] sponge acting as the [[anode]], a [[manganese dioxide]] [[cathode]], and a [[dielectric]] layer of [[tantalum pentoxide]] created on the tantalum sponge surface by [[anodizing]].  It may happen that the tantalum oxide layer has weak spots that undergo [[dielectric breakdown]] during a [[voltage spike]]. The tantalum sponge then comes into direct contact with the manganese dioxide, and increased leakage current causes localized heating; usually, this drives an [[endothermic]] chemical reaction that produces [[manganese(III) oxide]] and regenerates ([[self-healing|self-heals]]) the tantalum oxide dielectric layer.\n\nHowever, if the energy dissipated at the failure point is high enough, a self-sustaining [[exothermic]] reaction can start, similar to the [[thermite]] reaction, with metallic tantalum as fuel and manganese dioxide as oxidizer.  This undesirable reaction will destroy the capacitor, producing [[smoke]] and possibly [[flame]].<ref>http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/failure.pdf Failure modes of tantalum capacitors manufactured in different ways</ref>\n\nTherefore, tantalum capacitors can be freely deployed in small-signal circuits, but application in high-power circuits must be carefully designed to avoid thermal runaway failures.\n\n===Digital logic===\nThe [[Leakage (semiconductors)|leakage current]] of logic switching transistors increases with temperature. In rare instances, this may lead to thermal runaway in digital circuits. This is not a common problem, since leakage currents usually make up a small portion of overall power consumption, so the increase in power is fairly modest \u2014 for an [[Athlon 64]], the power dissipation increases by about 10% for every 30 degrees Celsius.<ref>[http://www.lostcircuits.com/cpu/amd_venice/ LostCircuits, CPU Guide<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> For a device with a [[Thermal Design Power|TDP]] of 100 W, for thermal runaway to occur, the heat sink would have to have a [[Thermal conductivity#Related terms|thermal resistivity]] of over 3 K/W (kelvins per watt), which is about 6 times worse than a stock Athlon 64 heat sink. (A stock Athlon 64 heat sink is rated at 0.34 K/W, although the actual thermal resistance to the environment is somewhat higher, due to the thermal boundary between processor and heatsink, rising temperatures in the case, and other thermal resistances.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}.) Regardless, an inadequate heat sink with a thermal resistance of over 0.5 to 1 K/W would result in the destruction of a 100 W device even without thermal runaway effects.\n\n===Batteries===\nWhen handled improperly,  or if manufactured defectively, some [[rechargeable batteries]] can experience thermal runaway resulting in overheating. Sealed cells will sometimes explode violently if safety vents are overwhelmed or nonfunctional.<ref name= \"Finegan:2015\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ncomms7924| title = In-operando high-speed tomography of lithium-ion batteries during thermal runaway| journal = Nature Communications| volume = 6| pages = 6924| year = 2015| last1 = Finegan | first1 = D.

Such a scenario may arise in stars containing [[degenerate matter]], in which [[electron degeneracy pressure]] rather than normal thermal pressure does most of the work of supporting the star against gravity, and in stars undergoing implosion. In all cases, the imbalance arises prior to fusion ignition; otherwise, the fusion reactions would be naturally regulated to counteract temperature changes and stabilize the star. When thermal pressure is in equilibrium with overlying pressure, a star will respond to the increase in temperature and thermal pressure due to initiation of a new exothermic reaction by expanding and cooling. A runaway reaction is only possible when this response is inhibited.\n\n===Helium flashes in red giant stars===\nWhen stars in the 0.8-2.0 [[solar mass]] range exhaust the hydrogen in their cores and become [[red giant]]s, the helium accumulating in their cores reaches degeneracy before it ignites. When the degenerate core reaches a critical mass of about 0.45 solar masses, [[helium fusion]] is ignited and takes off in a runaway fashion, called the [[helium flash]], briefly increasing the star's energy production to a rate 100 billion times normal. About 6% of the core is quickly converted into carbon.<ref>[http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~infocom/The%20Website/end.html The End Of The Sun]</ref> While the release is sufficient to convert the core back into normal [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] after a few seconds, it does not disrupt the star,<ref>[https://astro.uni-bonn.de/~nlanger/siu_web/ssescript/new/chapter9.pdf Chapter 9: Post-main sequence evolution through helium burning]</ref><ref name=\"DearbornLattanzio2006\">{{cite journal|last1=Dearborn|first1=D.

If a white dwarf has a companion star from which it can [[Accretion disc|accrete gas]], the material will accumulate in a surface layer made degenerate by the dwarf's intense gravity. Under the right conditions, a sufficiently thick layer of hydrogen is eventually heated to a temperature of 20 million K, igniting runaway fusion.

As the core heats further, the gamma rays eventually begin to pass the energy threshold needed for collision-induced decay into [[electron]]-[[positron]] pairs, a process called [[pair production]]. This causes a drop in the pressure within the core, leading it to contract and heat further, causing more pair production, a further pressure drop, and so on. The core starts to undergo [[gravitational collapse]]. At some point this ignites runaway oxygen fusion, releasing enough energy to obliterate the star. These explosions are rare, perhaps about one per 100,000 supernovae.\n\n===Comparison to nonrunaway supernovae===\nNot all supernovae are triggered by runaway nuclear fusion. [[Type Ib and Ic supernovae|Type Ib, Ic]] and [[type II supernova]]e also undergo core collapse, but because they have exhausted their supply of atomic nuclei capable of undergoing exothermic fusion reactions, they collapse all the way into [[neutron star]]s, or in the higher-mass cases, [[stellar black hole]]s, powering explosions by the release of [[gravitational potential energy]]. It is the absence of runaway fusion reactions that allows such supernovae to leave behind [[Compact star|compact stellar remnants]].\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner battery problems]] (related to lithium-ion batteries)\n* [[Lithium ion battery#Safety|Lithium Ion Batteries and Safety]]\n* [[Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents]] (related to lithium-ion batteries)\n* [[UPS Flight 6]] (a 2010 jet crash related to lithium-ion batteries in the cargo)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.safetycenter.navy.mil/media/mech/issues/summer03/thermalrunaway.htm Safetycenter.navy.mil: Thermal runaway]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thermal Runaway}}\n[[Category:Chemical process engineering]]\n[[Category:Chemical reaction engineering]]\n[[Category:Electronic engineering]]\n[[Category:Semiconductor device defects]]\n[[Category:Hazards]]\n[[Category:Cataclysmic variable stars]]"}]}}}}
