It is an [[oxide]] where [[lead]] is in an [[oxidation state]] +4.  It is of an intermediate bond type, displaying both ionic (e.g. the lattice structure) and covalent (e.g. its low melting point and insolubility in water) properties.  It is an odorless dark-brown crystalline powder which is nearly insoluble in water. It exists in two crystalline forms. The alpha phase has [[orthorhombic]] symmetry; it has been first synthesized in 1941 and identified in nature as a rare mineral [[scrutinyite]] in 1988. The more common, [[tetragonal]] beta phase was first identified as the mineral [[plattnerite]] around 1845 and later produced synthetically. Lead dioxide is a strong oxidizing agent which is used in the manufacture of matches, pyrotechnics, dyes and other chemicals. It also has several important applications in [[electrochemistry]], in particular in the positive plates of [[lead acid battery|lead acid batteries]].\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Physical===\n[[File:ScrutinyiteStructure.png|thumb|left|120px|Crystal structure of \u03b1-PbO<sub>2</sub>]]\n[[File:PlattneriteStructure.png|thumb|left|120px|Crystal structure of \u03b2-PbO<sub>2</sub>]]\nLead dioxide is an odorless dark-brown crystalline powder which is nearly insoluble in water.<ref name=en>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Owuv-c9L_IMC&pg=PA590|page=590|title=Concise encyclopedia chemistry|author=Mary Eagleson|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1994|isbn=3-11-011451-8}}</ref> It has two major polymorphs, alpha and beta, which occur naturally as rare minerals [[scrutinyite]] and [[plattnerite]], respectively.

Therefore, thermal decomposition of lead dioxide is a common industrial way of producing various lead oxides.<ref name=g/>\n\n===Chemical===\nLead dioxide is an [[amphoteric]] compound with prevalent acidic properties.

Deficiency of oxygen (or excess of lead) results in the characteristic metallic conductivity of lead dioxide, with a resistivity as low as 10<sup>\u22124</sup> Ohm\u00b7cm and which is exploited in various electrochemical applications. Like metals, lead dioxide has a characteristic electrode potential, and in [[electrolyte]]s it can be polarized both [[anode|anodically]] and [[cathode|cathodically]]. Lead dioxide electrodes have a dual action, that is both the lead and oxygen ions take part in the electrochemical reactions.<ref name=b1>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PGzaO48Rz0C&pg=PA184|pages=184 ff.|title=Electrochemical power sources: primary and secondary batteries|author= M.

By this way lead 2+ is oxidized to lead 4+ and Cl<sub>2</sub> vapors rise from the hypochlorite solution. By the decomposition of NaClO to NaOH, stoichiometric amounts of PbO<sub>2</sub> react with NaOH to form the di-sodium hexa hydroxo plumbate ion, soluble in water.\n\n===Electrolysis===\nAn alternative synthesis method is [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]]: lead dioxide forms on pure lead, in dilute [[sulfuric acid]], when polarized anodically at electrode potential about +1.5 V at room temperature. This procedure is used for large-scale industrial production of PbO<sub>2</sub> anodes. Lead and [[copper]] electrodes are immersed in sulfuric acid flowing at a rate of 5\u201310 L/min. The electrodeposition is carried out [[galvanostat]]ically, by applying a current of about 100 A/m<sup>2</sup> for about 30 minutes. The drawback of the lead electrode is its softness, especially compared to the hard and brittle PbO<sub>2</sub> which has a [[Mohs hardness]] of 5.5.<ref name=mindat>[http://www.mindat.org/min-3237.html Plattnerite at Mindat]</ref> This mismatch in mechanical properties results in peeling of the coating. Therefore, an alternative method is to use harder substrates, such as [[titanium]], [[niobium]], [[tantalum]] or [[graphite]] and deposit PbO<sub>2</sub> on them from [[lead(II) nitrate]] in static or flowing sulfuric acid. The substrate is usually [[Abrasive blasting|sand-blasted]] before the deposition to remove surface oxide and contamination and to increase the surface roughness and adhesion of the coating.<ref name=el>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ArsfQZig_9AC&pg=PA573|page=574|title=Materials Handbook: A Concise Desktop Reference|author=Fran\u00e7ois Cardarelli|publisher=Springer|year=2008|isbn=1-84628-668-9}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nLead dioxide is used in the production of [[match]]es, pyrotechnics, dyes and the curing of [[sulfide]] [[polymer]]s. It is also used in the construction of high-voltage [[lightning arrester]]s.<ref name=g>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd|page=386}}</ref>\n\nLead dioxide is used as anode material in electrochemistry. Beta-PbO<sub>2</sub> is more attractive for this purpose than the alpha form because it has relatively low resistivity, good corrosion resistance even in low-pH medium, and a high [[overvoltage]] for the evolution of oxygen in sulfuric acid and nitric acid based electrolytes. Lead dioxide can also withstand chlorine evolution in [[hydrochloric acid]]. Lead dioxide anodes are inexpensive and were once used instead of conventional platinum and graphite electrodes for regenerating [[potassium dichromate]]. They were also applied as oxygen anodes for [[electroplating]] copper and zinc in sulfate baths. In organic synthesis, lead dioxide anodes were applied for the production of [[glyoxylic acid]] from [[oxalic acid]] in a sulfuric acid electrolyte.<ref name=el/>\n\nThe most important use of lead dioxide is as the cathode of [[lead acid battery|lead acid batteries]]. Its utility arises from the anomalous metallic conductivity of PbO<sub>2</sub>. The [[lead acid]] battery stores and releases energy by shifting the equilibrium (a comproportionation) between metallic lead, lead dioxide, and lead(II) salts in [[sulfuric acid]]. \n:Pb + PbO<sub>2</sub> + 2 HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> + 2 H<sup>+</sup> \u2192 2 PbSO<sub>4</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O, E = +2.05 V\n\n==Safety==\nBeing a strong oxidant, lead dioxide is a poison when ingested. The associated symptoms include abdominal pain and spasms, nausea, vomiting and headache. Acute poisoning can lead to muscle weakness, metallic taste, loss of appetite, insomnia, dizziness, with shock, coma and death in extreme cases. The poisoning also results in high lead levels in blood and urine. Contact with skin or eyes results in local irritation and pain.<ref>[http://hazard.com/msds/mf/baker/baker/files/l2956.htm Lead dioxide MSDS]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.npi.gov.au/database/substance-info/profiles/50.html National Pollutant Inventory: Lead and Lead Compounds Fact Sheet]\n\n{{Lead compounds}}\n{{Oxides}}\n\n[[Category:Oxides]]\n[[Category:Lead compounds]]\n[[Category:Acidic oxides]]\n[[Category:Plumbates]]\n[[Category:Pyrotechnic oxidizers]]"}]}}}}
