In the context of [[general relativity]], where gravitation is reduced to a space-time curvature, a body in free fall has no force acting on it and moves along a [[geodesic]]. The present article only concerns itself with free fall in the Newtonian domain.\n\nAn object in the technical sense of free fall may not necessarily be falling down in the usual sense of the term. An object moving upwards would not normally be considered to be falling, but if it is subject to the force of gravity only, it is said to be in free fall. The moon is thus in free fall.\n\nIn a uniform gravitational field, in the absence of any other forces, gravitation acts on each part of the body equally and this is  [[weightlessness]], a condition that also occurs when the gravitational field is zero (such as when far away from any gravitating body). A body in free fall experiences \"0 g\".\n\nThe term \"free fall\" is often used more loosely than in the strict sense defined above. Thus, falling through an [[atmosphere]] without a deployed [[parachute]], or lifting device, is also often referred to as ''free fall''. The [[aerodynamic]] drag forces in such situations prevent them from producing full weightlessness, and thus a skydiver's \"free fall\" after reaching [[terminal velocity]] produces the sensation of the body's weight being supported on a cushion of air.\n\n==History==\nIn the Western world prior to the 16th century, it was generally assumed that the speed of a falling body would be proportional to its weight\u2014that is, a 10&nbsp;kg object was expected to fall ten times faster than an otherwise identical 1&nbsp;kg object through the same medium. The ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384\u2013322 BC) discussed falling objects in what was perhaps the first book on mechanics.\n\nThe Italian scientist [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564\u20131642) subjected the Aristotelian theories to experimentation and careful observation. He then combined the results of these experiments with mathematical analysis in an unprecedented way.\n\nIn a tale that may be apocryphal, Galileo (or an assistant, more likely) dropped two objects of unequal mass from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Given the speed at which such a fall would occur, it is doubtful that Galileo could have extracted much information from this experiment. Most of his observations of falling bodies were really of bodies rolling down ramps. This slowed things down enough to the point where he was able to measure the time intervals with water clocks and his own pulse (stopwatches having not yet been invented). This he repeated \"a full hundred times\" until he had achieved \"an accuracy such that the deviation between two observations never exceeded one-tenth of a pulse beat.\"\n\n==Examples==\n\nExamples of objects in free fall include:\n* A [[spacecraft]] (in space) with propulsion off (e.g. in a continuous orbit, or on a suborbital trajectory ([[ballistics]]) going up for some minutes, and then down).\n* An object dropped at the top of a [[drop tube]].\n* An object thrown upward or a person jumping off the ground at low speed (i.e. as long as air resistance is negligible in comparison to weight).\nTechnically, an object is in free fall even when moving upwards or instantaneously at rest at the top of its motion. If gravity is the only influence acting, then the acceleration is always downward and has the same magnitude for all bodies, commonly denoted <math>g</math>.\n\nSince all objects fall at the same rate in the absence of other forces, objects and people will experience [[weightlessness]] in these situations.\n\nExamples of objects '''not''' in free fall:\n* Flying in an aircraft: there is also an additional force of lift.\n* Standing on the ground: the gravitational force is counteracted by the [[normal force]] from the ground.\n* Descending to the Earth using a parachute, which balances the force of gravity with an aerodynamic drag force (and with some parachutes, an additional lift force).\n\nThe example of a falling skydiver who has not yet deployed a parachute is not considered free fall from a physics perspective, since he experiences a [[drag force]] that equals his weight once he has achieved terminal velocity (see below). However, the term \"free fall skydiving\" is commonly used to describe this case in everyday speech, and in the skydiving community. It is not clear, though, whether the more recent sport of [[wingsuit flying]] fits under the definition of free fall skydiving.\n\n[[File:Drop time.jpg|thumb|300px|right| Measured fall time of a small steel sphere falling from various heights. The data is in good agreement with the predicted fall time of <math>\\sqrt{2h/g}</math>, where h is the height and g is the free-fall acceleration due to gravity.]]\nNear the surface of the Earth, an object in free fall in a vacuum will accelerate at approximately 9.8&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>, independent of its [[mass]]. With air resistance acting on an object that has been dropped, the object will eventually reach a [[terminal velocity]], which is around 53&nbsp;m/s (195&nbsp;km/h or 122&nbsp;mph<ref name=\"Greenharbor\"/>) for a human skydiver. The terminal velocity depends on many factors including mass, [[drag coefficient]], and relative surface area and will only be achieved if the fall is from sufficient altitude. A typical skydiver in a spread-eagle position will reach terminal velocity after about 12 seconds, during which time he will have fallen around 450&nbsp;m (1,500&nbsp;ft).<ref name=\"Greenharbor\">{{cite web | url=http://www.greenharbor.com/fffolder/speedtime.pdf | title=Free fall graph | publisher=Green Harbor Publications | date=2010 | accessdate=14 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nFree fall was demonstrated on the moon by astronaut [[David Scott]] on August 2, 1971. He simultaneously released a hammer and a feather from the same height above the moon's surface. The hammer and the feather both fell at the same rate and hit the ground at the same time. This demonstrated Galileo's discovery that, in the absence of air resistance, all objects experience the same acceleration due to gravity. (On the Moon, the gravitational acceleration is much less than on Earth, approximately 1.6&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>.)\n\n==Free fall in Newtonian mechanics==\n{{Main|Newtonian mechanics}}\n\n=== Uniform gravitational field without air resistance ===\nThis is the \"textbook\" case of the vertical motion of an object falling a small distance close to the surface of a planet. It is a good approximation in air as long as the force of gravity on the object is much greater than the force of air resistance, or equivalently the object's velocity is always much less than the terminal velocity (see below).\n\n[[File:Free-fall.gif|right|100px|Free-fall]]\n:<math>v(t)=-gt+v_{0}\\,</math>\n\n:<math>y(t)=-\\frac{1}{2}gt^2+v_{0}t+y_0</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>v_{0}\\,</math> is the initial velocity (m/s).\n:<math>v(t)\\,</math> is the vertical velocity with respect to time (m/s).\n:<math>y_0\\,</math> is the initial altitude (m).\n:<math>y(t)\\,</math> is the altitude with respect to time (m).\n:<math>t\\,</math> is time elapsed (s).\n:<math>g\\,</math> is the acceleration due to [[gravity]] (9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup> near the surface of the earth).\n\n=== Uniform gravitational field with air resistance ===\n[[File:MeteorAccGraph.jpg|thumb|350px|Acceleration of a small meteoroid when entering the Earth's atmosphere at different initial velocities.]]\n\nThis case, which applies to skydivers, parachutists or any body of mass, <math>m</math>, and cross-sectional area, <math>A</math>, with [[Reynolds number]] well above the critical Reynolds number, so that the air resistance is proportional to the square of the fall velocity, <math>v</math>, has an equation of motion\n:<math>m\\frac{dv}{dt}=mg - \\frac{1}{2} \\rho C_{\\mathrm{D}} A v^2 \\, ,</math>\nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the [[Density of air|air density]] and <math>C_{\\mathrm{D}}</math> is the [[drag coefficient]], assumed to be constant although in general it will depend on the Reynolds number.\n\nAssuming an object falling from rest and no change in air density with altitude, the solution is:\n: <math>v(t) = v_{\\infty} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{gt}{v_\\infty}\\right),</math>\n\nwhere the [[terminal speed]] is given by\n:<math>v_{\\infty}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2mg}{\\rho C_D A}} \\, .</math>\n\nThe object's speed versus time can be integrated over time to find the vertical position as a function of time:\n\n:<math>y = y_0 - \\frac{v_{\\infty}^2}{g} \\ln \\cosh\\left(\\frac{gt}{v_\\infty}\\right).</math>\n\nUsing the figure of 56&nbsp;m/s for the terminal velocity of a human, one finds that after 10 seconds he will have fallen 348 metres and attained 94% of terminal velocity, and after 12 seconds he will have fallen 455 metres and will have attained 97% of terminal velocity. However, when the air density cannot be assumed to be constant, such as for objects or skydivers falling from high altitude, the equation of motion becomes much more difficult to solve analytically and a numerical simulation of the motion is usually necessary. The figure shows the forces acting on meteoroids falling through the Earth's upper atmosphere. [[HALO jump]]s, including Joe Kittinger's and Felix Baumgartner's record jumps (see below), and the planned [[Le Grand Saut]], also belong in this category.<ref>An analysis of his and similar jumps is given in {{cite journal|title=High altitude free fall|journal= American Journal of Physics |volume= 64 |issue= 10 |pages= 1242 |author1=Mohazzabi, P. |author2=Shea, J. |doi=10.1119/1.18386|bibcode=1996AmJPh..64.1242M|url=http://www.jasoncantarella.com/downloads/AJP001242.pdf|year= 1996 }}</ref>\n\n=== Inverse-square law gravitational field ===\nIt can be said that two objects in space orbiting each other in the absence of other forces are in free fall around each other, e.g. that the Moon or an artificial satellite \"falls around\" the Earth, or a planet \"falls around\" the Sun. Assuming spherical objects means that the equation of motion is governed by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, with solutions to the [[gravitational two-body problem]] being [[elliptic orbits]] obeying [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]]. This connection between falling objects close to the Earth and orbiting objects is best illustrated by the thought experiment, [[Newton's cannonball]].\n\nThe motion of two objects moving radially towards each other with no angular momentum can be considered a special case of an elliptical orbit of [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] {{nowrap|''e'' {{=}} 1}} ([[radial elliptic trajectory]]). This allows one to compute the [[free-fall time]] for two point objects on a radial path. The solution of this equation of motion yields time as a function of separation:\n:<math>t(y)= \\sqrt{ \\frac{ {y_0}^3 }{2\\mu} } \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{y}{y_0}\\left(1-\\frac{y}{y_0}\\right)} + \\arccos{\\sqrt{\\frac{y}{y_0}}}\n \\right)</math>\n\nwhere\n:''t'' is the time after the start of the fall\n:''y'' is the distance between the centers of the bodies\n:''y''<sub>0</sub> is the initial value of ''y''\n:{{nowrap|''\u03bc'' {{=}} ''G''(''m''<sub>1</sub> + ''m''<sub>2</sub>)}} is the [[standard gravitational parameter]].\n\nSubstituting ''y ''= 0 we get the [[free-fall time]].\n\nThe separation as a function of time is given by the inverse of the equation. The inverse is represented exactly by the analytic power series:\n\n:<math> y( t ) = \\sum_{n=1}^{ \\infty }\n\\left[\n \\lim_{ r \\to 0 } \\left(\n  {\\frac{ x^{ n }}{ n! }}\n   \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{\\,n-1}}{\\mathrm{ d } r ^{\\,n-1}} \\left[\n    r^n \\left( \\frac{ 7 }{ 2 } ( \\arcsin( \\sqrt{ r } ) - \\sqrt{ r - r^2 } ) \n   \\right)^{ - \\frac{2}{3} n }\n  \\right] \\right)\n \\right]\n</math>\n\nEvaluating this yields:<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0143-0807/29/5/012|title=From Moon-fall to motions under inverse square laws|journal=European Journal of Physics|volume=29|issue=5|pages=987|year=2008|last1=Foong|first1=S K}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1119/1.3246467|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA534896|title=Radial Motion of Two Mutually Attracting Particles|journal=The Physics Teacher|volume=47|issue=8|pages=502|year=2009|last1=Mungan|first1=Carl E.}}</ref>\n:<math>y(t)=y_0 \\left( x - \\frac{1}{5} x^2 - \\frac{3}{175}x^3 \n - \\frac{23}{7875}x^4 - \\frac{1894}{3931875}x^5 - \\frac{3293}{21896875}x^6 - \\frac{2418092}{62077640625}x^7 - \\cdots \\right) \\ \n</math>\nwhere\n\n<math> x = \\left[\\frac{3}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2}- t \\sqrt{ \\frac{2\\mu}{ {y_0}^3 } } \\right) \\right]^{2/3} </math>\n\n==Free fall in general relativity==\n{{Main|General relativity}}\n\nIn general relativity, an object in free fall is subject to no force and is an inertial body moving along a geodesic. Far away from any sources of space time curvature, where spacetime is flat, the Newtonian theory of free fall agrees with general relativity but otherwise the two disagree. The experimental observation that all objects in free fall accelerate at the same rate, as noted by Galileo and then embodied in Newton's theory as the equality of gravitational and inertial masses, and later confirmed to high accuracy by modern forms of the [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiment]], is the basis of the [[equivalence principle]], from which basis Einstein's theory of general relativity initially took off.\n\n== Record free fall parachute jumps ==\n[[File:Kittinger-jump.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Joseph Kittinger]] starting his record-breaking skydive in 1960. His record was broken only in 2012.]]\n\nIn 1914, while doing demonstrations for the [[U.S. Army]], a parachute pioneer named [[Tiny Broadwick]] deployed her chute manually, thus becoming the first person to jump free-fall.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'', [[Eugene Andreev]] ([[USSR]]) holds the official FAI record for the longest free-fall parachute jump after falling for {{convert|24500|m|ft}} from an altitude of {{convert|25458|m|ft}} near the city of [[Saratov, Russia]] on November 1, 1962. Although later on jumpers would ascend higher altitudes, Andreev's record was set without the use of a [[drogue chute]] during the jump and therefore remains the longest genuine ''free fall'' record.<ref>[http://stratocat.com.ar/fichas-e/1960/HMN-19600816.htm Data of the stratospheric balloon launched on 8/16/1960 For EXCELSIOR III].

For [[Project Excelsior]] (meaning \"ever upward\", a name given to the project by Colonel [[John Stapp]]), as part of research into high altitude bailout, he made a series of three parachute jumps wearing a pressurized suit, from a helium balloon with an open gondola.\n\nThe first, from 76,400 feet (23,290&nbsp;m) in November 1959 was a near tragedy when an equipment malfunction caused him to lose consciousness, but the automatic parachute saved him (he went into a flat spin at a rotational velocity of 120 rpm; the g-force at his extremities was calculated to be over 22 times that of gravity, setting another record). Three weeks later he jumped again from 74,700 feet (22,770&nbsp;m). For that return jump Kittinger was awarded the [[A. Leo Stevens parachute medal]].\n\nOn August 16, 1960 he made the final jump from the Excelsior III at 102,800 feet (31,330&nbsp;m). Towing a small drogue chute for stabilization, he fell for 4 minutes and 36 seconds reaching a maximum speed of 614&nbsp;mph (988&nbsp;km/h)<ref>{{cite web|title=Speed of a Skydiver (Terminal Velocity)|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/JianHuang.shtml|publisher=Hyper Text Book}}</ref> before opening his parachute at 14,000 feet (4,270&nbsp;m).
