The high number of degrees of freedom allows the arm to \u201c[[snake]]\u201d along a path or around an obstacle \u2013 hence the name \u201csnake-arm\u201d.\n\n== Definition ==\n[[Image:ElephantArmRobot.jpg|right|90px|thumbnail|Elephant Trunk robotic arm]]\n\nSnake-arm robots are also described as continuum robots and [[Elephant#Trunk|elephant\u2019s trunk]] robots although these descriptions are restrictive in their definitions and cannot be applied to all snake-arm robots.\n\n* A continuum robot is a continuously curving manipulator, much like the arm of an octopus.\n* An elephant\u2019s trunk robot is a good descriptor of a continuum robot. This has generally been associated with whole arm manipulation \u2013 where the entire arm is used to grasp and manipulate objects, in the same way that an elephant would pick up a ball.\n\nThis is an emerging field and as such there is no agreement on the best term for this class of robot.\n\nSnake-arm robots are often used in association with another device. The function of the other device is to *introduce the snake-arm into the [[confined space]]. Examples of possible introduction axes include mounting a snake-arm on a [[Remote Control Vehicle|remote controlled vehicle]] or an industrial robot or designing a bespoke a [[linear actuator]]. In this case the shape of the arm is coordinated with the linear movement of the introduction axis enabling the arm to follow a path into confined spaces.\n\nOther features which are usually (but not always) associated with snake-arm robots:\n* Continuous diameter along the length of the arm\n* Self-supporting\n* Either tendon-driven or [[Pneumatics|pneumatically controlled]] in most cases.\n\nA snake-arm robot is not to be confused with a [[snakebot]] which mimics the biomorphic motion of a snake in order to slither along the ground.\n\n== Applications ==\nThe ability to reach into confined spaces lends itself to many applications involving access problems. The list below is not intended to be an exhaustive list of possibilities but merely an indication of where these robots are being used or developed for use.\n\n=== Industry ===\n{{main|Industrial robot}}\n* [[Nuclear power|Nuclear]]\n** Decommissioning <ref name=\"BBCvideo\">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-15073514 \"Robot snake created by Bristol engineers\"], Dave Harvey, BBC News Website ([[bbc.co.uk]]), 27 September 2011</ref>\n** Repair and maintenance <ref name=\"IndustrialRobot\">[http://www.ocrobotics.com/downloads/IR2005.pdf \"Snaking around in a nuclear jungle\"], Rob Buckingham and Andrew Graham,  Int.

Anderson, commonly called the Scripps Tensor Arm, is a spine-like elephant trunk arm.
