According to the philosopher [[Nikolas Kompridis]], who has argued for its importance to [[democracy|democratic politics]], [[romanticism]] and [[critical theory]], the term has both [[ontology|ontological]] and [[ethical]] dimensions, and refers to a mode of listening and \"normative response\" to demands arising outside the self, as well as \"a way by which we might become more attuned to our [[world disclosure|pre-reflective understanding]] of the world, to our inherited [[ontology|ontologies]],\" thereby generating [[instrumental rationality|non-instrumental]] possibilities for social change and self-transformation.<ref>Nikolas Kompridis, ''Critique and Disclosre: Critical Theory between Past and Future'' (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2006), pp. 199-210.</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ethicsandglobalpolitics.net/index.php/egp/issue/view/536 \"A Politics of Receptivity\".] Special issue of ''Ethics and Global Politics'', Vol 4, No 4 (2011), guest editor Nikolas Kompridis.\n\n[[Category:Critical theory]]\n[[Category:Ethical theories]]\n[[Category:Political theories]]"}]}}}}
