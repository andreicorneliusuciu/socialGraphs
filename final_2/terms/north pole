It defines geodetic [[latitude]] 90\u00b0 North, as well as the direction of [[true north]]. At the North Pole all directions point south; all lines of [[longitude]] converge there, so its longitude can be defined as any degree value. Along tight latitude circles, counterclockwise is east and clockwise is west. The North Pole is at the center of the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nWhile the South Pole lies on a continental [[Antarctica|land mass]], the North Pole is located in the middle of the [[Arctic Ocean]] amid waters that are almost permanently covered with constantly shifting [[sea ice]]. This makes it impractical to construct a permanent station at the North Pole (unlike the South Pole). However, the [[Soviet Union]], and later Russia, constructed a number of [[Drifting ice station|manned drifting stations]] on a generally annual basis since 1937, some of which have passed over or very close to the Pole. Since 2002, the Russians have also annually established a base, [[Barneo]], close to the Pole. This operates for a few weeks during early spring. Studies in the 2000s predicted that the North Pole may become seasonally ice-free because of [[Climate change in the Arctic|Arctic ice shrinkage]], with timescales varying from 2016<ref>Black, Richard (8 April 2001).

Around the beginning of the 20th century astronomers noticed a small apparent \"variation of latitude,\" as determined for a fixed point on Earth from the observation of stars. Part of this variation could be attributed to a wandering of the Pole across the Earth's surface, by a range of a few metres. The wandering has several periodic components and an irregular component. The component with a period of about 435 days is identified with the eight-month wandering predicted by Euler and is now called the [[Chandler wobble]] after its discoverer. The exact point of intersection of the Earth's axis and the Earth's surface, at any given moment, is called the \"instantaneous pole\", but because of the \"wobble\" this cannot be used as a definition of a fixed North Pole (or South Pole) when metre-scale precision is required.\n\nIt is desirable to tie the system of Earth coordinates (latitude, longitude, and elevations or [[orography]]) to fixed landforms. Of course, given [[plate tectonics]] and [[isostasy]], there is no system in which all geographic features are fixed. Yet the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] and the [[International Astronomical Union]] have defined a framework called the [[International Terrestrial Reference System]].\n\n==Exploration==\n{{See also|Arctic exploration|Farthest North|List of Arctic expeditions|List of firsts in the Geographic North Pole}}\n\n===Pre-1900===\n[[File:Mercator north pole 1595.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Gerardus Mercator]]'s map of the North Pole from 1595]]\n[[File:C.G.

Several expeditions set out to find the way, generally with whaling ships, already commonly used in the cold northern latitudes.\n\nOne of the earliest expeditions to set out with the explicit intention of reaching the North Pole was that of British naval officer [[William Parry (explorer)|William Edward Parry]], who in 1827 reached latitude 82\u00b045\u2032 North. In 1871 the [[Polaris expedition]], a US attempt on the Pole led by [[Charles Francis Hall]], ended in disaster. Another British [[Royal Navy]] attempt on the pole, part of the [[British Arctic Expedition]], by Commander [[Albert Hastings Markham|Albert H. Markham]] reached a then-record 83\u00b020'26\" North in May 1876 before turning back. An 1879\u20131881 expedition commanded by [[United States Navy|US naval]] officer [[George W. DeLong]] ended tragically when their ship, the [[USS Jeannette (1878)|USS ''Jeanette'']], was crushed by ice. Over half the crew, including DeLong, were lost.\n\n[[File:Nansen-fram.jpg|thumb|left|Nansen's ship ''Fram'' in the Arctic ice]]\nIn April 1895 the Norwegian explorers [[Fridtjof Nansen]] and [[Hjalmar Johansen]] struck out for the Pole on skis after leaving Nansen's icebound ship ''[[Fram]]''. The pair reached latitude 86\u00b014\u2032 North before they abandoned the attempt and turned southwards, eventually reaching [[Franz Josef Land]].\n\nIn 1897 Swedish engineer [[Salomon August Andr\u00e9e]] and two companions tried to reach the North Pole in the hydrogen balloon ''\u00d6rnen'' (\"Eagle\"), but came down {{convert|300|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Kvit\u00f8ya]], the northeasternmost part of the [[Svalbard]] archipelago. They trekked to Kvit\u00f8ya but died there three months later.  In 1930 the remains of [[S. A. Andr\u00e9e's Arctic Balloon Expedition of 1897|this expedition]] were found by the Norwegian [[Bratvaag Expedition]].\n\nThe Italian explorer [[Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi|Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi]] and Captain [[Umberto Cagni]] of the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (Regia Marina) sailed the converted whaler ''[[Jason (ship)|Stella Polare]]'' (\"Pole Star\") from Norway in 1899. On 11 March 1900 Cagni led a party over the ice and reached latitude 86\u00b0 34\u2019 on 25 April, setting a new record by beating Nansen's result of 1895 by {{convert|35|to|40|km|abbr=on}}. Cagni barely managed to return to the camp, remaining there until 23 June. On 16 August the ''Stella Polare'' left [[Rudolf Island]] heading south and the expedition returned to Norway.\n\n===1900\u201340===\n[[File:Peary Sledge Party and Flags at the Pole.jpg|thumb|Peary's sledge party at what they claimed was the North Pole, 1909.

However, Peary's claim remains highly disputed and controversial. Those who accompanied Peary on the final stage of the journey were not trained in navigation, and thus could not independently confirm his navigational work, which some claim to have been particularly sloppy as he approached the Pole.\n\nThe distances and speeds that Peary claimed to have achieved once the last support party turned back seem incredible to many people, almost three times that which he had accomplished up to that point. Peary's account of a journey to the Pole and back while traveling along the direct line&nbsp;\u2013 the only strategy that is consistent with the time constraints that he was facing&nbsp;\u2013 is contradicted by Henson's account of tortuous detours to avoid [[Pressure ridge (ice)|pressure ridge]]s and [[Lead (sea ice)|open lead]]s.\n\nThe  British explorer [[Wally Herbert]], initially a supporter of Peary, researched Peary's records in 1989 and found that there were significant discrepancies in the explorer's navigational records. He concluded that Peary had not reached the Pole.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sir-wally-herbert-453324.html |title=Sir Wally Herbert |work=The Independent |date=16 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224045237/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sir-wally-herbert-453324.html |archivedate=24 December 2008 }}</ref> Support for Peary came again in 2005, however, when British explorer [[Tom Avery]] and four companions recreated the outward portion of Peary's journey with replica wooden sleds and [[Canadian Eskimo Dog]] teams, reaching the North Pole in 36 days, 22 hours&nbsp;\u2013 nearly five hours faster than Peary. However, Avery's fastest 5-day march was 90 nautical miles, significantly short of the 135 claimed by Peary. Avery writes on his web site that \"The admiration and respect which I hold for Robert Peary, Matthew Henson and the four Inuit men who ventured North in 1909, has grown enormously since we set out from [[Cape Columbia]].

They departed from Cape Crozier, [[Ellesmere Island]], on 17 February 1982 and arrived at the geographic North Pole on 10 April 1982. They travelled on foot and snowmobile. From the Pole, they travelled towards Svalbard but, due to the unstable nature of the ice, ended their crossing at the ice edge after drifting south on an ice floe for 99 days. They were eventually able to walk to their expedition ship ''MV Benjamin Bowring'' and boarded it on 4 August 1982 at position 80:31N 00:59W. As a result of this journey, which formed a section of the three-year [[Transglobe Expedition]] 1979\u20131982, Fiennes and Burton became the first people to complete a circumnavigation of the world via both North and South Poles, by surface travel alone.

The expedition was totally self-dependent and used no external supplies. The expedition was supported by the [[Russian Geographical Society]].<ref name=\"yemelya.ru\"/>\n\n==Day and night==\nThe sun at the North Pole is continuously [[Midnight sun|above the horizon]] during the summer and continuously [[Polar night|below the horizon]] during the winter. [[Sunrise]] is just before the [[March equinox]] (around 20 March); the sun then takes three months to reach its highest point of near 23\u00bd\u00b0 elevation at the summer [[solstice]] (around 21 June), after which time it begins to sink, reaching [[sunset]] just after the [[September equinox]] (around 23 September). When the sun is visible in the polar sky, it appears to move in a horizontal circle above the horizon. This circle gradually rises from near the horizon just after the vernal equinox to its maximum elevation (in degrees) above the horizon at summer solstice and then sinks back toward the horizon before sinking below it at the autumnal equinox.\n\nA civil [[twilight]] period of about two weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset, a nautical twilight period of about five weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset and an astronomical twilight period of about seven weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset.\n\nThese effects are caused by a combination of the Earth's [[axial tilt]] and its revolution around the sun. The direction of the Earth's axial tilt, as well as its angle relative to the plane of the Earth's orbit around the sun, remains very nearly constant over the course of a year (both change very slowly over long time periods). At northern midsummer the North Pole is facing towards the sun to its maximum extent. As the year progresses and the Earth moves around the sun, the North Pole gradually turns away from the sun until at midwinter it is facing away from the Sun to its maximum extent. A similar sequence is observed at the South Pole, with a six-month time difference.\n\n==Time==\nIn most places on Earth, local time is determined by longitude, such that the time of day is more-or-less synchronised to the position of the sun in the sky (for example, at midday the sun is roughly at its highest). This line of reasoning fails at the North Pole, where the sun rises and sets only once per year, and all lines of longitude, and hence all time zones, converge. There is no permanent human presence at the North Pole and no particular time zone has been assigned. Polar expeditions may use any time zone that is convenient, such as [[Greenwich Mean Time]], or the time zone of the country from which they departed.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:2007 Arctic Sea Ice.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Climate change in the Arctic|Arctic ice shrinkage]]s of 2007 compared to 2005 and also compared to the 1979\u20132000 average.]]\n{{main|Climate of the Arctic}}\n{{See also|Climate change in the Arctic}}\nThe North Pole is substantially warmer than the [[South Pole]] because it lies at sea level in the middle of an ocean (which acts as a reservoir of heat), rather than at altitude on a continental land mass.\n\nWinter temperatures at the North Pole can range from about {{convert|-50|to|-13|C|0}}, averaging around {{convert|-31|C|0}}.{{Ref|A|A}} However, a freak storm caused the temperature to reach {{convert|0.7|C|0}} for a time at a [[World Meteorological Organization]] buoy, located at 87.45\u00b0N, on December 30, 2015.
