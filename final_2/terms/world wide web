[[CERN]], ground floor of building No.1]]\n\n[[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s vision of a global hyperlinked information system became a possibility by the second half of the 1980s. By 1985, the global Internet began to proliferate in Europe and in the [[Domain Name System]] (upon which the [[Uniform Resource Locator]] is built) came into being. In 1988 the first direct IP connection between Europe and North America was made and Berners-Lee began to openly discuss the possibility of a web-like system at CERN.<ref>http://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs315/BOOKS/TBL12.pdf</ref> In March 1989 Berners-Lee issued a proposal to the management at CERN for a system called \"Mesh\" that referenced [[ENQUIRE]], a database and software project he had built in 1980, which used the term \"web\" and described a more elaborate information management system based on links embedded in readable text: \"Imagine, then, the references in this document all being associated with the network address of the thing to which they referred, so that while reading this document you could skip to them with a click of the mouse.\" Such a system, he explained, could be referred to using one of the existing meanings of the word ''[[hypertext]]'', a term that he says was coined in the 1950s. There is no reason, the proposal continues, why such hypertext links could not encompass multimedia documents including graphics, speech and video, so that Berners-Lee goes on to use the term ''[[hypermedia]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Berners-Lee |first=Tim |url=http://w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html |date=March 1989 |title=Information Management: A Proposal |publisher=W3C |accessdate=27 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nWith help from his colleague and fellow hypertext enthusiast [[Robert Cailliau]] he published a more formal proposal on 12 November 1990 to build a \"Hypertext project\" called \"WorldWideWeb\" (one word) as a \"web\" of \"hypertext documents\" to be viewed by \"[[Web browser|browsers]]\" using a [[client\u2013server architecture]].<ref name=\"W90\">{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/Proposal.html |title=WorldWideWeb: Proposal for a HyperText Project |first1=Tim |last1=Berners-Lee |authorlink1=Tim Berners-Lee |first2=Robert |last2=Cailliau |authorlink2=Robert Cailliau|date=12 November 1990 |accessdate=12 May 2015}}</ref> At this point HTML and [[HTTP]] had already been in development for about two months and the first Web server was about a month from completing its first successful test. This proposal estimated that a read-only web would be developed within three months and that it would take six months to achieve \"the creation of new links and new material by readers, [so that] authorship becomes universal\" as well as \"the automatic notification of a reader when new material of interest to him/her has become available.\" While the read-only goal was met, accessible authorship of web content took longer to mature, with the [[wiki]] concept, [[WebDAV]], [[blog]]s, [[Web 2.0]] and [[RSS]]/[[Atom (standard)|Atom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.cern.ch/NextBrowser.html|title=Tim Berners-Lee's original World Wide Web browser|quote=With recent phenomena like blogs and wikis, the Web is beginning to develop the kind of collaborative nature that its inventor envisaged from the start.}}</ref>\n[[File:Cern datacenter.jpg|thumb|The CERN [[data center|data centre]] in 2010 housing some WWW servers]]\nThe proposal was modelled after the [[SGML]] reader [[Dynatext]] by Electronic Book Technology, a spin-off from the [[Institute for Research in Information and Scholarship]] at [[Brown University]]. The Dynatext system, licensed by CERN, was a key player in the extension of SGML ISO 8879:1986 to Hypermedia within [[HyTime]], but it was considered too expensive and had an inappropriate licensing policy for use in the general high energy physics community, namely a fee for each document and each document alteration. A [[NeXT Computer]] was used by Berners-Lee as the world's first [[web server]] and also to write the first [[web browser]], [[WorldWideWeb]], in 1990. By Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/WorldWideWeb |title=Tim Berners-Lee: client |publisher=W3.org |accessdate=27 July 2009}}</ref> the [[WorldWideWeb|first web browser]] (which was a web editor as well) and the first web server. The first web site,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html |title=First Web pages |publisher=W3.org |accessdate=27 July 2009}}</ref> which described the project itself, was published on 20 December 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.cern/topics/birth-web|title=The birth of the web|publisher=CERN|accessdate=23 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first web page may be lost, but [[Paul Jones (computer technologist)|Paul Jones]] of [[UNC-Chapel Hill]] in North Carolina announced in May 2013 that Berners-Lee gave him what he says is the oldest known web page during a 1991 visit to UNC. Jones stored it on a [[magneto-optical drive]] and on his NeXT computer.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hunt for world's oldest WWW page leads to UNC Chapel Hill|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/05/24/2915835/hunt-for-worlds-oldest-www-page.html|last=Murawski|first=John|work=[[News & Observer]]|date=24 May 2013}}</ref> On 6 August 1991, Berners-Lee published a short summary of the World Wide Web project on the [[newsgroup]] ''alt.hypertext''.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://groups.google.com/group/alt.hypertext/msg/395f282a67a1916c |title=Short summary of the World Wide Web project |publisher=Google |date=6 August 1991 |accessdate=27 July 2009}}</ref> This date is sometimes confused with the public availability of the first web servers, which had occurred months earlier. As another example of such confusion, several news media reported that the first photo on the Web was published by Berners-Lee in 1992, an image of the CERN house band [[Les Horribles Cernettes]] taken by Silvano de Gennaro; Gennaro has disclaimed this story, writing that media were \"totally distorting our words for the sake of cheap sensationalism.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Silvano de Gennaro disclaims 'the first photo on the Web'|url=http://musiclub.web.cern.ch/MusiClub/bands/cernettes/disclaimer.html|quote=If you read well our website, it says that it was, to our knowledge, the 'first photo of a band'.

Accounts differ substantially as to the date of this event. The World Wide Web Consortium's timeline says December 1992,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/2005/01/timelines/timeline-2500x998.png|title=W3C timeline|accessdate=30 March 2010}}</ref> whereas SLAC itself claims December 1991,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slac.stanford.edu/history/earlyweb/history.shtml|title=The Early World Wide Web at SLAC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://slac.stanford.edu/spires/about/|title=About SPIRES|accessdate=30 March 2010}}</ref> as does a W3C document titled ''A Little History of the World Wide Web''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/History.html|title=A Little History of the World Wide Web}}</ref> The underlying concept of hypertext originated in previous projects from the 1960s, such as the [[Hypertext Editing System]] (HES) at Brown University, [[Ted Nelson]]'s [[Project Xanadu]], and [[Douglas Engelbart]]'s [[NLS (computer system)|oN-Line System]] (NLS). Both Nelson and Engelbart were in turn inspired by [[Vannevar Bush]]'s [[microfilm]]-based ''[[memex]]'', which was described in the 1945 essay \"[[As We May Think]]\".<ref name=Conkling>{{Citation\n| last = Conklin| first = Jeff| year = 1987| title = IEEE Computer| volume = 20| issue = 9| publication-date = 1987| pages = 17\u201341}}</ref>\n\nBerners-Lee's breakthrough was to marry hypertext to the Internet. In his book ''[[Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web by its inventor|Weaving The Web]]'', he explains that he had repeatedly suggested that a marriage between the two technologies was possible to members of ''both'' technical communities, but when no one took up his invitation, he finally assumed the project himself. In the process, he developed three essential technologies:\n* a system of globally unique identifiers for resources on the Web and elsewhere, the universal document identifier (UDI), later known as [[uniform resource locator]] (URL) and [[uniform resource identifier]] (URI);\n* the publishing language [[Hypertext Markup Language|HyperText Markup Language]] (HTML);\n* the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP).<ref>{{cite web|title=Inventor of the Week Archive: The World Wide Web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/berners-lee.html|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]: MIT School of Engineering|accessdate=23 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608081841/http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/berners-lee.html |archivedate=8 June 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe World Wide Web had a number of differences from other hypertext systems available at the time. The Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones, making it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource. It also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison to earlier systems), but in turn presented the chronic problem of ''[[link rot]]''.\nUnlike predecessors such as [[HyperCard]], the World Wide Web was non-proprietary, making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/Welcome.html |title=Ten Years Public Domain for the Original Web Software |publisher=Tenyears-www.web.cern.ch |date=30 April 2003 |accessdate=27 July 2009}}</ref> Coming two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] protocol was no longer free to use, this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and towards the Web.

Funding for Mosaic came from the U.S. ''High-Performance Computing and Communications Initiative'' and the ''[[High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991]]'', one of [[Al Gore and information technology|several computing developments initiated by U.S. Senator Al Gore]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.washington.edu/homes/lazowska/faculty.lecture/innovation/gore.html |title=Vice President Al Gore's ENIAC Anniversary Speech |publisher=Cs.washington.edu |date=14 February 1996 |accessdate=27 July 2009}}</ref> Prior to the release of Mosaic, graphics were not commonly mixed with text in web pages and the web's popularity was less than older protocols in use over the Internet, such as [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] and [[Wide Area Information Servers]] (WAIS). Mosaic's graphical user interface allowed the Web to become, by far, the most popular Internet protocol. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. It was founded at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), which had pioneered the Internet; a year later, a second site was founded at [[INRIA]] (a French national computer research lab) with support from the [[European Commission]] DG InfSo; and in 1996, a third continental site was created in Japan at [[Keio University]]. By the end of 1994, the total number of websites was still relatively small, but many [[List of websites founded before 1995|notable websites]] were already active that foreshadowed or inspired today's most popular services.\n\nConnected by the Internet, other websites were created around the world. This motivated international standards development for protocols and formatting. Berners-Lee continued to stay involved in guiding the development of web standards, such as the [[markup language]]s to compose web pages and he advocated his vision of a [[Semantic Web]]. The World Wide Web enabled the spread of information over the Internet through an easy-to-use and flexible format. It thus played an important role in popularising use of the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Internet |title=Internet legal definition of Internet |publisher=Free Online Law Dictionary |date=15 July 2009 |work=West's Encyclopedia of American Law, edition 2 |accessdate=25 November 2008}}</ref> Although the two terms are sometimes [[conflation|conflated]] in popular use, ''World Wide Web'' is not [[synonym]]ous with ''Internet''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://techterms.com/definition/www |title=WWW (World Wide Web) Definition |publisher=TechTerms\n|accessdate= 19 February 2010}}</ref> The Web is an [[information space]] containing hyperlinked documents and other [[Web resource|resources]], identified by their URIs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=Ian|last2=Walsh|first2=Norman|title=Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume One|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#intro|publisher=W3C|accessdate=11 February 2015|location=Introduction|date=15 December 2004}}</ref> It is implemented as  both client and server software using Internet protocols such as [[TCP/IP]] and [[HTTP]].

The advent of the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] web browser helped to make the web much more usable, to include the display of images and moving images ([[gif]]s).]]\n\nThe terms ''Internet'' and ''World Wide Web'' are often used without much distinction. However, the two are not the same. The Internet is a global system of interconnected [[computer network]]s. In contrast, the World Wide Web is a global collection of documents and other [[Web resource|resources]], linked by hyperlinks and [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URIs]]. Web resources are usually accessed using [[HTTP]], which is one of many Internet communication protocols.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is the difference between the Web and the Internet?|url=https://www.w3.org/Help/#webinternet|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=18 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nViewing a [[web page]] on the World Wide Web normally begins either by typing the [[uniform resource locator|URL]] of the page into a web browser, or by following a hyperlink to that page or resource. The web browser then initiates a series of background communication messages to fetch and display the requested page. In the 1990s, using a browser to view web pages\u2014and to move from one web page to another through hyperlinks\u2014came to be known as 'browsing,' 'web surfing' (after [[channel surfing]]), or 'navigating the Web'. Early studies of this new behaviour investigated user patterns in using web browsers. One study, for example, found five user patterns: exploratory surfing, window surfing, evolved surfing, bounded navigation and targeted navigation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Muylle|first=Steve|author2=Rudy Moenaert |author3=Marc Despont |title=A grounded theory of World Wide Web search behaviour|journal=Journal of Marketing Communications|year=1999|volume=5|issue=3|page=143|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/rjmc/1999/00000005/00000003/art00004|doi=10.1080/135272699345644}}</ref>\n\nThe following example demonstrates the functioning of a web browser when accessing a page at the URL <code><nowiki>http://www.example.org/home.html</nowiki></code>. The browser resolves the server name of the URL (<code>www.example.org</code>) into an [[IP address|Internet Protocol address]] using the globally distributed [[Domain Name System]] (DNS). This lookup returns an IP address such as ''203.0.113.4'' or ''2001:db8:2e::7334''. The browser then requests the resource by sending an [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] request across the Internet to the computer at that address. It requests service from a specific TCP port number that is well known for the HTTP service, so that the receiving host can distinguish an HTTP request from other network protocols it may be servicing.  The HTTP protocol normally uses [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port number 80]]. The content of the HTTP request can be as simple as two lines of text:\n<source lang=\"http\">\nGET /home.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.org\n</source>\n\nThe computer receiving the HTTP request delivers it to web server software listening for requests on port 80. If the web server can fulfil the request it sends an HTTP response back to the browser indicating success:\n<source lang=\"http\">\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n</source>\n\nfollowed by the content of the requested page. HyperText Markup Language ([[HTML]]) for a basic web page might look like this:\n<source lang=\"html\">\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Example.org \u2013 The World Wide Web</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <p>The World Wide Web, abbreviated as WWW and commonly known ...</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\nThe web browser [[parsing|parses]] the HTML and interprets the markup (<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\" inline><title></syntaxhighlight>, <syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\" inline><p></syntaxhighlight> for paragraph, and such) that surrounds the words to format the text on the screen. Many web pages use HTML to reference the URLs of other resources such as images, other embedded media, [[Client-side scripting|scripts]] that affect page behaviour, and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] that affect page layout. The browser makes additional HTTP requests to the web server for these other [[Internet media type]]s. As it receives their content from the web server, the browser progressively [[Layout engine|renders]] the page onto the screen as specified by its HTML and these additional resources.\n\n===Linking===\nMost web pages contain hyperlinks to other related pages and perhaps to downloadable files, source documents, definitions and other web resources. In the underlying HTML, a hyperlink looks like this:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\" inline><a href=\"http://www.example.org/home.html\">Example.org Homepage</a></syntaxhighlight>\n[[File:WorldWideWebAroundWikipedia.png|thumb|Graphic representation of a minute fraction of the WWW, demonstrating [[hyperlink]]s]]\nSuch a collection of useful, related resources, interconnected via hypertext links is dubbed a ''web'' of information. Publication on the Internet created what Tim Berners-Lee first called the ''WorldWideWeb'' (in its original [[CamelCase]], which was subsequently discarded) in November 1990.<ref name=\"W90\"/>\n\nThe hyperlink structure of the WWW is described by the [[webgraph]]: the nodes of the webgraph correspond to the web pages (or URLs) the directed edges between them to the hyperlinks. Over time, many web resources pointed to by hyperlinks disappear, relocate, or are replaced with different content. This makes hyperlinks obsolete, a phenomenon referred to in some circles as link rot, and the hyperlinks affected by it are often called [[dead link]]s. The ephemeral nature of the Web has prompted many efforts to archive web sites. The [[Internet Archive]], active since 1996, is the best known of such efforts.\n\n===Dynamic updates of web pages===\n{{Main article|Ajax (programming)}}\n[[JavaScript]] is a [[scripting programming language|scripting language]] that was initially developed in 1995 by [[Brendan Eich]], then of [[Netscape]], for use within web pages.<ref name=Hamilton>{{cite web|author=Hamilton, Naomi|title=The A-Z of Programming Languages: JavaScript|url=http://computerworld.com.au/article/255293/-z_programming_languages_javascript|date=31 July 2008|work=Computerworld|publisher=IDG|accessdate=12 May 2009}}</ref> The standardised version is [[ECMAScript]].<ref name=Hamilton /> To make web pages more interactive, some web applications also use JavaScript techniques such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] ([[Asynchronous I/O|asynchronous]] JavaScript and [[XML]]). [[Client-side scripting|Client-side script]] is delivered with the page that can make additional HTTP requests to the server, either in response to user actions such as mouse movements or clicks, or based on elapsed time. The server's responses are used to modify the current page rather than creating a new page with each response, so the server needs only to provide limited, incremental information. Multiple Ajax requests can be handled at the same time, and users can interact with the page while data is retrieved. Web pages may also regularly [[polling (computer science)|poll]] the server to check whether new information is available.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://buntin.org/2008/sep/23/jquery-polling-plugin/\n|title=jQuery Polling plugin\n|date=23 September 2008\n|last=Buntin\n|first=Seth\n|accessdate=2009-08-22\n}}</ref>\n\n===WWW prefix===\n<!-- WWW prefix redirects here -->\nMany hostnames used for the World Wide Web begin with ''www'' because of the long-standing practice of naming Internet hosts according to the services they provide. The [[hostname]] of a [[web server]] is often ''www'', in the same way that it may be ''ftp'' for an [[FTP server]], and ''news'' or ''nntp'' for a [[USENET]] [[news server]]. These host names appear as Domain Name System (DNS) or [[subdomain]] names, as in ''www.example.com''. The use of ''www'' is not required by any technical or policy standard and many web sites do not use it; indeed, the first ever web server was called ''nxoc01.cern.ch''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html |title=Frequently asked questions by the Press | first = Tim | last = Berners-Lee |publisher=W3C | accessdate=27 July 2009}}</ref> According to Paolo Palazzi,<ref>Palazzi, P (2011) [http://soft-shake.ch/2011/en/conference/sessions.html?key=earlydays 'The Early Days of the WWW at CERN']</ref> who worked at CERN along with Tim Berners-Lee, the popular use of ''www'' as subdomain was accidental; the World Wide Web project page was intended to be published at www.cern.ch while info.cern.ch was intended to be the CERN home page, however the DNS records were never switched, and the practice of prepending ''www'' to an institution's website domain name was subsequently copied. Many established websites still use the prefix, or they employ other subdomain names such as ''www2'', ''secure'' or ''en'' for special purposes. Many such web servers are set up so that both the main domain name (e.g., example.com) and the ''www'' subdomain (e.g., www.example.com) refer to the same site; others require one form or the other, or they may map to different web sites. The use of a subdomain name is useful for [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] incoming web traffic by creating a [[CNAME record]] that points to a cluster of web servers. Since, currently, only a subdomain can be used in a CNAME, the same result cannot be achieved by using the bare domain root.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nWhen a user submits an incomplete domain name to a web browser in its address bar input field, some web browsers automatically try adding the prefix \"www\" to the beginning of it and possibly \".com\", \".org\" and \".net\" at the end, depending on what might be missing. For example, entering '{{not a typo|microsoft}}' may be transformed to ''<nowiki>http://www.microsoft.com/</nowiki>'' and 'openoffice' to ''<nowiki>http://www.openoffice.org</nowiki>''.

Also, unless set not to do so, most web browsers record requested web pages in a viewable ''history'' feature, and usually [[Web cache|cache]] much of the content locally. Unless  the server-browser communication uses HTTPS encryption, web requests and responses travel in plain text across the Internet and can be viewed, recorded, and cached by intermediate systems. When a web page asks for, and the user supplies, [[personally identifiable information]]\u2014such as their real name, address, e-mail address, etc.\u2014web-based entities can associate current web traffic with that individual. If the website uses [[HTTP cookie]]s, username and password authentication, or other tracking techniques, it can relate other web visits, before and after, to the identifiable information provided. In this way it is possible for a web-based organisation to develop and build a profile of the individual people who use its site or sites. It may be able to build a record for an individual that includes information about their leisure activities, their shopping interests, their profession, and other aspects of their [[demographic profile]]. These profiles are obviously of potential interest to marketeers, advertisers and others. Depending on the website's [[terms and conditions]] and the local laws that apply information from these profiles may be sold, shared, or passed to other organisations without the user being informed. For many ordinary people, this means little more than some unexpected e-mails in their in-box, or some uncannily relevant advertising on a future web page. For others, it can mean that time spent indulging an unusual interest can result in a deluge of further targeted marketing that may be unwelcome. Law enforcement, counter terrorism and espionage agencies can also identify, target and track individuals based on their interests or proclivities on the Web.\n\n[[Social networking]] sites try to get users to use their real names, interests, and locations, rather than pseudonyms. These website's leaders believe this makes the social networking experience more engaging for users. On the other hand, uploaded photographs or unguarded statements can be identified to an individual, who may regret this exposure. Employers, schools, parents, and other relatives may be influenced by aspects of social networking profiles, such as text posts or digital photos, that the posting individual did not intend for these audiences. [[Cyberbullying|On-line bullies]] may make use of personal information to harass or [[cyberstalking|stalk]] users. Modern social networking websites allow fine grained control of the privacy settings for each individual posting, but these can be complex and not easy to find or use, especially for beginners.<ref>{{cite journal|last=boyd|first=danah|author2=Hargittai, Eszter |title=Facebook privacy settings: Who cares?|journal=First Monday|date=July 2010|volume=15|issue=8|url=http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3086/2589|publisher=University of Illinois at Chicago}}</ref> Photographs and videos posted onto websites have caused particular problems, as they can add a person's face to an on-line profile. With modern and potential [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition technology]], it may then be possible to relate that face with other, previously anonymous, images, events and scenarios that have been imaged elsewhere. Because of image caching, mirroring and copying, it is difficult to remove an image from the World Wide Web.\n\n==Standards==\n{{Main article|Web standards}}\nMany formal standards and other technical specifications and software define the operation of different aspects of the World Wide Web, the Internet, and computer information exchange. Many of the documents are the work of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), headed by Berners-Lee, but some are produced by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) and other organisations.\n\nUsually, when web standards are discussed, the following publications are seen as foundational:\n* Recommendations for [[markup languages]], especially [[HTML]] and [[XHTML]], from the W3C. These define the structure and interpretation of hypertext documents.\n* Recommendations for [[style sheet (web development)|stylesheets]], especially [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], from the W3C.\n* Standards for ECMAScript (usually in the form of JavaScript), from [[Ecma International]].\n* Recommendations for the [[Document Object Model]], from W3C.\n\nAdditional publications provide definitions of other essential technologies for the World Wide Web, including, but not limited to, the following:\n* ''Uniform Resource Identifier'' (URI), which is a universal system for referencing resources on the Internet, such as hypertext documents and images. URIs, often called URLs, are defined by the IETF's RFC 3986 / STD 66: ''Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax'', as well as its predecessors and numerous [[URI scheme]]-defining [[Request For Comments|RFCs]];\n* ''HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)'', especially as defined by RFC 2616: ''HTTP/1.1'' and RFC 2617: ''HTTP Authentication'', which specify how the browser and server authenticate each other.\n\n==Accessibility==\n{{Main article|Web accessibility}}\nThere are methods for accessing the Web in alternative mediums and formats to facilitate use by individuals with [[disability|disabilities]].

The user experience is interrupted and the user is likely to leave the site or system.\n\n==Web caching==\nA [[web cache]] is a server computer located either on the public Internet, or within an enterprise that stores recently accessed web pages to improve response time for users when the same content is requested within a certain time after the original request. Most web browsers also implement a [[browser cache]] for recently obtained data, usually on the local disk drive. HTTP requests by a browser may ask only for data that has changed since the last access. Web pages and resources may contain expiration information to control caching to secure sensitive data, such as in [[online banking]], or to facilitate frequently updated sites, such as news media. Even sites with highly dynamic content may permit basic resources to be refreshed only occasionally. Web site designers find it worthwhile to collate resources such as CSS data and JavaScript into a few site-wide files so that they can be cached efficiently.
