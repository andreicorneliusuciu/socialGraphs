Machines are usually [[Work (physics)|powered]] by chemical, [[thermal]], or electrical means, and are often [[Engine|motorized]]. Historically, a [[power tool]] also required moving parts to classify as a machine. However, the advent of [[electronics]] has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines.<ref name=AHD/>\n\nA [[simple machine]] is a device that simply transforms the direction or [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of a [[force]], but a large number of more complex machines exist. Examples include [[vehicle]]s, [[electronic system]]s, [[molecular machine]]s, [[computer]]s, [[television]], and [[radio\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''[[:wikt:machine|machine]]'' derives from the [[Latin]] word ''machina'',<ref name=AHD>''The American Heritage Dictionary'', Second College Edition.

The word ''mechanical'' comes from the same Greek roots.\n\nA wider meaning of \"fabric, structure\" is found in classical Latin, but not in Greek usage.\n\nThis meaning is found in late medieval French, and is adopted from the French into English in the mid-16th century.\n\nIn the 17th century, the word could also mean a scheme or plot, a meaning now expressed by the derived [[:wikt:machination|machination]].\nThe modern meaning develops out of specialized application of the term to [[stagecraft|stage engines]] used in [[Elizabethan theater|theater]] and to military [[siege engine]]s, both in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.\nThe [[OED]] traces the formal, modern meaning to [[John Harris (writer)|John Harris]]' ''[[Lexicon Technicum]]'' (1704), which has:\n:''Machine, or Engine, in Mechanicks, is whatsoever hath Force sufficient either to raise or stop the Motion of a Body... Simple Machines are commonly reckoned to be Six in Number, viz. the Ballance, Leaver, Pulley, Wheel, Wedge, and Screw... Compound Machines, or Engines, are innumerable.''\nThe word ''[[:wikt:engine|engine]]'' used as a (near-)synonym both by Harris and in later language derives ultimately (via Old French) from Latin ''ingenium'' \"ingenuity, an invention\".\n\n==History==\n{{expand section|date=March 2012}}\n[[File:Flint hand axe.JPG|thumb|right|Flint hand axe found in [[Winchester]]]]\nPerhaps the first example of a human made device designed to manage power is the [[hand axe]], made by chipping flint to form a [[wedge (mechanical device)|wedge]]. A wedge is a simple machine that transforms lateral force and movement of the tool into a transverse splitting force and movement of the workpiece.\n\nThe idea of a ''simple machine'' originated with the Greek philosopher [[Archimedes]] around the 3rd century BC, who studied the Archimedean simple machines: lever, pulley, and screw.<ref name=\"Asimov1988\"/><ref name=\"Chiu\">{{Citation   \n  | last = Chiu\n  | first = Y.

In 1586 Flemish engineer [[Simon Stevin]] derived the mechanical advantage of the inclined plane, and it was included with the other simple machines.   The complete dynamic theory of simple machines was worked out by Italian scientist [[Galileo Galilei]] in 1600 in ''Le Meccaniche'' (\"On Mechanics\").<ref name=\"Krebs\">{{cite book\n  |last=Krebs\n  |first=Robert E.\n  |title=Groundbreaking Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the Middle Ages\n  |year=2004\n  |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group\n  |isbn=0-313-32433-6\n  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MTXdplfiz-cC&pg=PA163&dq=%22mechanics+Galileo+analyzed%22#v=onepage&q=%22mechanics%20Galileo%20analyzed%22&f=false\n  |accessdate=2008-05-21\n  |page=163}}</ref><ref name=\"Stephen\">{{cite book   \n  | last = Stephen \n  | first = Donald \n  | authorlink = \n  |author2=Lowell Cardwell\n  | title = Wheels, clocks, and rockets: a history of technology\n  | publisher = W.

It mostly relates to the machinery tools and the mechanical applications of science. Some of its synonyms are automatic and mechanic.\n\n==== Simple machines ====\n{{main|Simple machine}}\n[[File:Table of Mechanicks, Cyclopaedia, Volume 2.png|thumb|250px|Table of simple mechanisms, from ''[[Chambers' Cyclop\u00e6dia]]'', 1728.<ref name=\"Mechanicks\">{{Citation |last=Chambers |first=Ephraim |year=1728 |title=Table of Mechanicks |work=Cyclopaedia, A Useful Dictionary of Arts and Sciences |volume=Volume 2 |location=London, England |page=528, Plate 11 }}.</ref> Simple machines provide a \"vocabulary\" for understanding more complex machines.]]\nThe idea that a machine can be broken down into simple movable elements led [[Archimedes]] to define the [[lever]], [[pulley]] and [[screw]] as [[simple machine]]s.  By the time of the Renaissance this list increased to include the [[wheel and axle]], [[Wedge (mechanical device)|wedge]] and [[inclined plane]].\n\n==== Engines ====\n{{main|engine}}\nAn '''engine''' or '''motor''' is a machine designed to convert energy into useful [[Motion (physics)|mechanical motion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/motor |title=Motor |quote=a person or thing that imparts motion, esp. a contrivance, as a steam engine, that receives and modifies energy from some natural source in order to utilize it in driving machinery. |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=2011-05-09}}</ref><ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/motor Dictionary.com: (World heritage)] \"3. any device that converts another form of energy into mechanical energy to produce motion\"</ref> [[Heat engine]]s, including [[internal combustion engine]]s and [[external combustion engine]]s (such as [[steam engine]]s) burn a [[fuel]] to create [[heat]], which is then used to create motion. [[Electric motor]]s convert electrical energy into [[Machine (mechanical)|mechanical]] motion, [[pneumatic motor]]s use [[compressed air]] and others, such as [[wind-up toy]]s use [[elastic energy]]. In biological systems, [[molecular motor]]s like [[myosin]]s in [[muscle]]s use [[chemical energy]] to create motion.\n\n===Electrical===\n'''Electrical''' means operating by or producing electricity, relating to or concerned with electricity. In other words, it means using, providing, producing, transmitting or operated by electricity.\n\n====Electrical machine====\n{{main|Electrical machine}}\nAn '''electrical machine''' is the generic name for a device that converts [[mechanical energy]] to [[electrical energy]], converts electrical energy to mechanical energy, or changes [[alternating current]] from one [[voltage]] level to a different voltage level.\n\n====Electronic machine====\n{{main|Electronics}}\n'''Electronics''' is the branch of [[physics]], [[engineering]] and [[technology]] dealing with [[electrical circuit]]s that involve [[active component|active electrical component]]s such as [[vacuum tube]]s, [[transistor]]s, [[diode]]s and [[integrated circuit]]s, and associated passive interconnection technologies. The [[nonlinear]] behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible and is usually applied to [[information processing|information]] and [[signal processing]].   Similarly, the ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information processing possible.   Interconnection technologies such as [[circuit board]]s, electronic packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a working [[system]].\n\n==== Computing machines ====\n{{main|Computer}}\nComputers are machines to process [[information]], often in the form of [[number]]s. [[Charles Babbage]] designed various machines to tabulate logarithms and other functions in 1837.  His [[Difference engine]] can be considered an advanced [[mechanical calculator]] and his [[Analytical Engine]] a forerunner of the modern [[computer]], though none were built in Babbage's lifetime.\n\nModern computers are [[Electronics|electronic]] ones. They use [[electric charge]], [[Electric current|current]] or [[magnetization]] to store and manipulate information. [[Computer architecture]] deals with detailed design of computers. There are also simplified models of computers, like [[Finite-state machine|State machine]] and [[Turing machine]].\n\n=== Molecular machines ===\nStudy of the molecules and proteins that are the basis of biological functions has led to the concept of a [[molecular machine]].  For example, current models of the operation of the [[kinesin]] molecule that transports vesicles inside the cell as well as the [[myosin]] molecule that operates against actin to cause muscle contraction; these molecules control movement in response to chemical stimuli.\n\nResearchers in nano-technology are working to construct molecules that perform movement in response to a specific stimulus.  In contrast to molecules such as [[kinesin]] and [[myosin]], these [[nanomachine]]s or molecular machines are constructions like traditional machines that are designed to perform in a task.\n\n== Machine elements ==\n{{main|machine element}}\nMachines are assembled from standardized types of components.  These elements consist of mechanisms that control movement in various ways such as gear trains, [[transistor]] switches, [[belt (mechanical)|belt]] or [[chain drive]]s, linkages, cam and follower systems, [[brake]]s and [[clutch]]es, and ''structural components'' such as frame members and [[fastener]]s.\n\nModern machines include sensors, actuators and computer controllers.  The shape, texture and color of covers provide a [[industrial design|styling and operational interface]] between the mechanical components of a machine and its users.\n\n=== Mechanisms ===\nAssemblies within a machine that control movement are often called \"[[mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]].\" <ref>Reuleaux, F., 1876 ''The Kinematics of Machinery,'' (trans. and annotated by A. B. W. Kennedy), reprinted by Dover, New York (1963)</ref><ref>J. J. Uicker, G. R. Pennock, and J. E. Shigley, 2003, ''Theory of Machines and Mechanisms,'' Oxford University Press, New York.</ref>  Mechanisms are generally classified as [[gear]]s and [[gear train]]s, [[cam]] and [[cam follower|follower]] mechanisms,  and [[linkage (mechanical)|linkages]], though there are other special mechanisms such as clamping linkages, indexing mechanisms and friction devices such as [[brake]]s and [[clutch]]es.\n\nFor more details on mechanical machines see [[Machine (mechanical)]] and [[Mechanical systems]].\n\n=== Controllers ===\nControllers combine [[sensor]]s, [[logic]], and [[actuator]]s to maintain the performance of components of a machine. Perhaps the best known is the [[centrifugal governor|flyball governor]] for a steam engine. Examples of these devices range from a thermostat that as temperature rises opens a valve to cooling water to speed controllers such the cruise control system in an automobile. The [[programmable logic controller]] replaced relays and specialized control mechanisms with a programmable computer. [[Servo motor]]s that accurately position a shaft in response to an electrical command are the actuators that make [[robot]]ic systems possible.\n\n==Impact==\n\n===Industrial Revolution===\n{{main|Industrial Revolution}}\nThe Industrial Revolution was a period from 1750 to 1850 where changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, transportation, and technology had a profound effect on the social, economic and cultural conditions of the times. It began in the [[United Kingdom]], then subsequently spread throughout [[Western Europe]], [[North America]], [[Japan]], and eventually the rest of the world.\n\nStarting in the later part of the 18th century, there began a transition in parts of Great Britain's previously manual labour and draft-animal\u2013based economy towards machine-based manufacturing. It started with the mechanisation of the textile industries, the development of [[iron-making]] techniques and the increased use of [[coke (fuel)|refined coal]].<ref name=\"World History: Patterns of Interaction\"/>\n\n===Mechanization and automation===\n{{main|Mechanization|automation}}\n[[File:Agricola1.jpg|thumb|right|A water-powered [[Hoist (device)#Mine hoists|mine hoist]] used for raising ore.  This  woodblock is from [[De re metallica]] by Georg Bauer (Latinized name [[Georgius Agricola]], ca. 1555) an early mining textbook that contains numerous drawings and descriptions of mining equipment.]]\n'''Mechanization'''  or mechanisation ([[British English|BE]]) is providing human operators with machinery that assists them with the muscular requirements of work or displaces muscular work.  In some fields, mechanization includes the use of hand tools.  In modern usage, such as in engineering or economics, mechanization implies machinery more complex than hand tools and would not include simple devices such as an un-geared horse or donkey mill. Devices that cause speed changes or changes to or from reciprocating to rotary motion, using means such as [[gear]]s, [[pulley]]s or [[line shaft|sheaves]] and belts, [[drive shaft|shafts]], [[cam]]s and [[Crank (mechanism)|cranks]], usually are considered machines.  After electrification, when most small machinery was no longer hand powered, mechanization was synonymous with motorized machines.<ref>Jerome (1934) gives the industry classification of machine tools as being \"other than hand power\".  Beginning with the 1900 U.S. census, power use was part of the definition of a factory, distinguishing it from a workshop.</ref>\n\n'''Automation''' is the use of [[control system]]s and [[information technology|information technologies]] to reduce the need for human work in the production of goods and services. In the scope of [[industrialization]], automation is a step beyond [[mechanization]]. Whereas mechanization provides human operators with machinery to assist them with the muscular requirements of work, automation greatly decreases the need for human sensory and mental requirements as well. Automation plays an increasingly important role in the [[world economy]] and in daily experience.\n\n[[File:Vaucanson duck1.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[Digesting Duck]]'' by [[Jacques de Vaucanson]], hailed in 1739 as the first automaton capable of [[digestion]]]]\n\n===Automata===\n{{main|automaton}}\nAn '''automaton''' (plural: '''automata''' or '''automatons''') is a self-operating machine. The word is sometimes used to describe a [[robot]], more specifically an [[autonomous robot]].
