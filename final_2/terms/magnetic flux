The [[SI]] [[unit of measurement|unit]] of magnetic flux is the [[Weber (unit)|weber]] (Wb) (in derived units: volt-seconds), and the [[Centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] unit is the [[Maxwell (unit)|maxwell]]. Magnetic flux is usually measured with a fluxmeter, which contains measuring coils and [[electronics]], that evaluates the change of [[voltage]] in the measuring coils to calculate the magnetic flux.\n\n==Description==\n {{multiple image\n   | align = right\n   | direction = vertical\n   | image1    = Surface integral illustration.svg\n   | caption1  = The magnetic flux through a surface\u2014when the magnetic field is variable\u2014relies on splitting the surface into small surface elements, over which the magnetic field can be considered to be locally constant.

Since a vector field is quite difficult to visualize at first, in elementary physics one may instead visualize this field with [[field line]]s. The magnetic flux through some surface, in this simplified picture, is proportional to the number of field lines passing through that surface (in some contexts, the flux may be defined to be precisely the number of field lines passing through that surface; although technically misleading, this distinction is not important). Note that the magnetic flux is the ''net'' number of field lines passing through that surface; that is, the number passing through in one direction minus the number passing through in the other direction (see below for deciding in which direction the field lines carry a positive sign and in which they carry a negative sign).\nIn more advanced physics, the field line analogy is dropped and the magnetic flux is properly defined as the surface integral of the normal component of the magnetic field passing through a surface. If the magnetic field is constant, the magnetic flux passing through a surface of [[vector area]] '''S''' is\n:<math>\n\\Phi_B = \\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\mathbf{S} = BS \\cos \\theta,\n</math>\nwhere ''B'' is the magnitude of the magnetic field (the magnetic flux density) having the unit of Wb/m<sup>2</sup> ([[Tesla (unit)|tesla]]), ''S'' is the area of the surface, and ''\u03b8'' is the angle between the magnetic [[field line]]s and the [[surface normal|normal (perpendicular)]] to '''S'''. For a varying magnetic field, we first consider the magnetic flux through an infinitesimal area element d'''S''', where we may consider the field to be constant: \n:<math>\nd\\Phi_B = \\mathbf{B} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S}.\n</math>\nA generic surface, '''S''', can then be broken into infinitesimal elements and the total magnetic flux through the surface is then the [[surface integral]]\n:<math>\n\\Phi_B = \\iint\\limits_S \\mathbf{B} \\cdot d\\mathbf S.\n</math>\nFrom the definition of the [[magnetic vector potential]] '''A''' and the [[Stokes' theorem|fundamental theorem of the curl]] the magnetic flux may also be defined as:\n:<math>\\Phi_B = \\oint\\limits_{\\partial S} \\mathbf{A} \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{\\ell},</math>\nwhere the [[line integral]] is taken over the boundary of the surface ''S'', which is denoted \u2202''S''.\n{{-}}\n\n==Magnetic flux through a closed surface==\n\n[[File:SurfacesWithAndWithoutBoundary.svg|right|thumb|200px|Some examples of [[closed surface]]s (left) and [[open surface]]s (right).

(A \"closed surface\" is a surface that completely encloses a volume(s) with no holes.) This law is a consequence of the empirical observation that [[magnetic monopole]]s have never been found.\n\nIn other words, Gauss's law for magnetism is the statement:\n\n:{{oiint\n| preintegral = <math>\\Phi_B=\\,\\!</math>\n| intsubscpt = <math>\\scriptstyle S</math>\n| integrand = <math>\\mathbf{B} \\cdot d\\mathbf S = 0</math>}}\n\nfor any [[closed surface]] ''S''.\n{{-}}\n\n==Magnetic flux through an open surface==\n\n{{Main|Faraday's law of induction}}\n\n[[Image:Vector field on a surface.svg|right|thumb|250px|For an open surface \u03a3, the [[electromotive force]] along the surface boundary, \u2202\u03a3, is a combination of the boundary's motion, with velocity '''v''', through a magnetic field '''B''' (illustrated by the generic '''F''' field in the diagram) and the induced electric field caused by the changing magnetic field.]]\n\nWhile the magnetic flux through a [[closed surface]] is always zero, the magnetic flux through an [[open surface]] need not be zero and is an important quantity in electromagnetism. For example, a change in the magnetic flux passing through a loop of conductive wire will cause an [[electromotive force]], and therefore an electric current, in the loop.  The relationship is given by [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]]:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{E} = \\oint_{\\partial \\Sigma}\\left(  \\mathbf{E} +\\mathbf{ v \\times B}\\right) \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{\\ell} = -{d\\Phi_B \\over dt},</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>\\mathcal{E}</math> is the electromotive force ([[electromotive force|EMF]]),\n:\u03a6<sub>''B''</sub> is the magnetic flux through the open surface \u03a3,\n:\u2202\u03a3 is the boundary of the open surface \u03a3; note that the surface, in general, may be in motion and deforming, and so is generally a function of time.
