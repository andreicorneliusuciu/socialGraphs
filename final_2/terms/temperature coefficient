For a property ''R'' that changes by ''dR'' when the temperature changes by ''dT'', the temperature coefficient \u03b1 is defined by\n:<math>\\frac{dR}{R} = \\alpha\\,dT.</math>\nHere \u03b1 has the [[dimension]] of an inverse temperature and can be expressed e.g. in 1/K or K<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nIf the temperature coefficient itself does not vary too much with temperature, a [[linear]] approximation can be used to determine the value ''R'' of a property at a temperature ''T'', given its value ''R''<sub>0</sub> at a reference temperature ''T''<sub>0</sub>:\n:<math>R(T) = R(T_0)(1 + \\alpha\\Delta T),</math>\nwhere \u0394''T'' is the difference between ''T'' and ''T''<sub>0</sub>.\nFor strongly temperature-dependent \u03b1, this approximation is only useful for small temperature differences \u0394''T''.\n\nTemperature coefficients are specified for various applications, including electric and magnetic properties of materials as well as reactivity. The temperature coefficient of most of the reactions lies between - 2 & 3\n\n==Negative temperature coefficient==\n{{Confusing section|reason=it's unclear whether this refers to a general negative temperature coefficient or concerning electrical conductivity specifically|small=no|date=January 2016}}\nMost [[ceramic]]s exhibit negative temperature dependence of resistance behaviour. This effect is governed by an [[Arrhenius equation]] over a wide range of temperatures:\n\n:<math>R=A \\cdot e^{\\frac{B}{T}}</math>\nwhere ''R'' is resistance, ''A'' and ''B'' are constants, and ''T'' is absolute temperature (K).\nThe constant ''B'' is related to the energies required to form and move the [[charge carrier]]s responsible for electrical conduction{{snd}} hence, as the value of ''B'' increases, the material becomes insulating. Practical and commercial NTC [[resistor]]s aim to combine modest resistance with a value of ''B'' that provides good sensitivity to temperature. Such is the importance of the ''B'' constant value, that it is possible to characterize NTC [[thermistor]]s using the B parameter equation:\n:<math>R = r^{\\infty}e^{\\frac{B}{T}} = R_{0}e^{-\\frac{B}{T_{0}}}e^{\\frac{B}{T}}</math>\nwhere <math>R_{0}</math> is resistance at temperature <math>T_{0}</math>.\nTherefore, many materials that produce acceptable values of <math>R_{0}</math> include materials that have been alloyed or possess variable '''negative temperature coefficient''' (NTC), which occurs when a physical property (such as [[thermal conductivity]] or [[electrical resistivity]]) of a material lowers with increasing temperature, typically in a defined temperature range. For most materials, electrical resistivity will decrease with increasing temperature.\n\nMaterials with a negative temperature coefficient have been used in [[floor heating]] since 1971. The negative temperature coefficient avoids excessive local heating beneath carpets, [[bean bag]] chairs, [[mattress]]es, etc., which can damage [[Wood flooring|wooden floors]], and may infrequently cause fires.\n\n==Reversible temperature coefficient==\nResidual magnetic flux density or [[Magnetic field#B and H|Br]] changes with temperature and it is one of the important characteristics of magnet performance. Some applications, such as inertial [[gyroscope]]s and [[traveling-wave tube]]s (TWTs), need to have constant field over a wide temperature range. The '''reversible temperature coefficient''' (RTC) of Br is defined as:\n:<math>RTC = \\frac{\\Delta Br}{Br \\Delta T} \\times 100</math>\n\nTo address these requirements, temperature compensated magnets were developed in the late 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.electronenergy.com/about-us/about-us.htm |title=About Us |publisher=Electron Energy Corporation}}</ref>  For conventional [[Samarium\u2013cobalt magnet|SmCo magnets]], Br decreases as temperature increases.  Conversely, for GdCo magnets, Br increases as temperature increases within certain temperature ranges. By combining [[samarium]] and [[gadolinium]] in the alloy, the temperature coefficient can be reduced to nearly zero.\n\n==Electrical resistance== <!-- NOTE: The article \"Servomechanism\" links directly to the section.

The temperature dependence of [[Electrical conductor|conductors]] is to a great degree linear and can be described by the approximation below.\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{\\rho}(T) = \\rho_{0}[1 + \\alpha_{0}(T-T_{0})]</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\\alpha_{0}=\\frac{1}{\\rho_{0}}\\left [ \\frac{\\delta \\rho}{\\delta T}\\right ]_{T=T_{0}}</math>\n<math>\\rho_{0}</math> just corresponds to the specific resistance temperature coefficient at a specified reference value (normally ''T'' = 0&nbsp;\u00b0C)<ref>{{cite book |first=S.

Materials which have useful engineering applications usually show a relatively rapid increase with temperature, i.e. a higher coefficient. The higher the coefficient, the greater an increase in electrical resistance for a given temperature increase. A PTC material can be designed to reach a maximum temperature for a given input voltage, since at some point any further increase in temperature would be met with greater electrical resistance. Unlike linear resistance heating or NTC materials, PTC materials are inherently self-limiting.\n\nSome materials even have exponentially increasing temperature coefficient. Example of such a material is [[PTC rubber]].\n\n===Negative temperature coefficient of resistance===\nA '''negative temperature coefficient''' (NTC) refers to materials that experience a decrease in electrical resistance when their temperature is raised. Materials which have useful engineering applications usually show a relatively rapid decrease with temperature, i.e. a lower coefficient. The lower the coefficient, the greater a decrease in electrical resistance for a given temperature increase. NTC materials are used to create [[inrush current limiter]]s (because they present higher initial resistance until the current limiter reaches quiescent temperature), [[temperature sensor]]s and [[thermistor]]s.\n\n===Negative Temperature Coefficient of Resistance Of a Semiconductor===\nAn increase in the temperature of a semiconducting material results in an increase in charge-carrier concentration. This results in a higher number of charge carriers available for recombination, increasing the conductivity of the semiconductor. The increasing conductivity causes the resistivity of the semiconductor material to decrease with the rise in temperature, resulting in a negative temperature coefficient of resistance.\n\n==Temperature coefficient of elasticity==\nThe [[elastic modulus]] of elastic materials varies with temperature, typically decreasing with higher temperature.\n\n==Temperature coefficient of reactivity==\nIn [[nuclear engineering]], the temperature coefficient of reactivity is a measure of the change in reactivity (resulting in a change in power), brought about by a change in temperature of the reactor components or the reactor coolant.  This may be defined as\n\n:<math>\\alpha_{T}=\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T}</math>\n\nWhere <math>\\rho</math> is [[Nuclear chain reaction#Effective neutron multiplication factor|reactivity]] and ''T'' is temperature.  The relationship shows that <math>\\alpha_{T}</math> is the value of the [[partial differential]] of reactivity with respect to temperature and is referred to as the \"temperature coefficient of reactivity\". As a result, the temperature feedback provided by <math>\\alpha_{T}</math> has an intuitive application to [[passive nuclear safety]]. A negative <math>\\alpha_{T}</math> is broadly cited as important for reactor safety, but wide temperature variations across real reactors (as opposed to a theoretical homogeneous reactor) limit the usability of a single metric as a marker of reactor safety.<ref>Duderstadt & Hamilton 1976, pp. 259\u2013261</ref>\n\nIn water moderated nuclear reactors, the bulk of reactivity changes with respect to temperature are brought about by changes in the temperature of the water. However each element of the core has a specific temperature coefficient of reactivity (e.g. the fuel or cladding). The mechanisms which drive fuel temperature coefficients of reactivity are different than water temperature coefficients. While water expands [[Water (properties)#Density of water and ice|as temperature increases]], causing longer neutron travel times during [[Neutron moderator|moderation]], fuel material will not expand appreciably. Changes in reactivity in fuel due to temperature stem from a phenomenon known as [[doppler broadening]], where resonance absorption of fast neutrons in fuel filler material prevents those neutrons from thermalizing (slowing down).<ref>Duderstadt & Hamilton 1976, pp. 556\u2013559</ref> {{Further|Fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity}}\n\n==Mathematical derivation of temperature coefficient approximation==\nIn its more general form, the temperature coefficient differential law is:\n:<math>\\frac{dR}{dT} = \\alpha\\,R</math>\n\nWhere is defined:\n:<math>R_0 = R(T_0)</math>\n\nAnd <math>\\alpha</math> is independent of <math>T</math>.\n\nIntegrating the temperature coefficient differential law:\n:<math>\\int_{R_0}^{R(T)}\\frac{dR}{R}=\\int_{T_0}^{T} \\alpha\\,dT\\,\\,\\,\\Rightarrow \\ln(R)\\vert_{R_0}^{R(T)}=\\alpha(T-T_0)\\,\\,\\,\\Rightarrow \\ln \\left ( \\frac{R(T)}{R_0} \\right ) =\\alpha(T-T_0)\\,\\,\\,\\Rightarrow R(T)=R_0 e^{\\alpha(T-T_0)}</math>\n\nApplying the [[Taylor series]] approximation at the first order, in the proximity of <math>T_0</math>, leads to:\n:<math>R(T) = R_0(1 + \\alpha(T-T_0))</math>\n\n==Units==\nThe thermal coefficient of [[Electrical network|electrical circuit]] parts is sometimes specified as [[Parts per notation|ppm]]/\u00b0[[Celsius|C]]. This specifies the fraction (expressed in parts per million) that its electrical characteristics will deviate when taken to a temperature above or below the [[operating temperature]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|last=Duderstadt|first=Jame J.|authorlink=James Johnson Duderstadt|author2=Hamilton, Louis J. |title=Nuclear Reactor Analysis|publisher=Wiley|year=1976|isbn=0-471-22363-8}}\n\n[[Category:Electric and magnetic fields in matter]]\n[[Category:Electrical engineering]]\n[[Category:Nuclear physics]]"}]}}}}
