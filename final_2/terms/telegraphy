Thus [[flag semaphore|semaphore]] is a method of telegraphy, whereas [[pigeon post]] is not.\n\nTelegraphy requires that the method used for encoding the message be known to both sender and receiver. Such methods are designed according to the limits of the signalling [[Media (communication)|medium]] used. The use of [[smoke signals]], [[beacon]]s, [[Heliograph|reflected light]] signals, and flag semaphore signals are early examples. In the 19th century, the harnessing of [[electricity]] led to the invention of [[electrical telegraph]]y. The advent of [[radio]] in the early 20th century brought about [[radiotelegraphy]] and other forms of [[wireless telegraphy]]. In the [[Internet]] age, telegraphic means developed greatly in sophistication and ease of use, with [[natural language interface]]s that hide the underlying code, allowing such technologies as [[electronic mail]] and [[instant messaging]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe word \"telegraph\" was first coined by the French inventor of the [[Semaphore line]], [[Claude Chappe]], who also coined the word \"semaphore\".<ref>Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions & Discoveries of the 18th Century, Jonathan Shectman, p172</ref>\n\nA \"telegraph\" is a device for transmitting and receiving messages over long distances, i.e., for telegraphy. The word \"telegraph\" alone now generally refers to an [[electrical telegraph]].\n\nWireless telegraphy is also known as \"CW\", for [[continuous wave]] (a carrier modulated by [[on-off keying]]), as opposed to the earlier radio technique of using a [[spark-gap transmitter|spark gap]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nContrary to the extensive definition used by Chappe, [[Samuel Morse|Morse]] argued that the term ''telegraph'' can strictly be applied only to systems that transmit ''and'' record messages at a distance. This is to be distinguished from ''semaphore'', which merely transmits messages. Smoke signals, for instance, are to be considered semaphore, not telegraph. According to Morse, telegraph dates only from 1832, when [[Pavel Schilling]] invented one of the earliest electrical telegraphs.<ref>Samuel F. B. Morse, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=rGgPAAAAYAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Examination of the Telegraphic Apparatus and the Processes in Telegraphy''], pages 7-8, Philp & Solomons 1869 {{OCLC|769828711}}.</ref>\n\nA telegraph message sent by an [[electrical telegraph]] operator or telegrapher using [[Morse code]] (or a [[printing telegraph]] operator using plain text) was known as a ''telegram''. A ''cablegram'' was a message sent by a submarine telegraph cable,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cablegram|title=Cablegram - Definition of cablegram by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}</ref> often shortened to a ''cable'' or a ''wire''. Later, a ''Telex'' was a message sent by a [[Teleprinter#Telex|Telex]] network, a switched network of [[teleprinter]]s similar to a telephone network.\n\nA ''wire picture'' or ''wire photo'' was a newspaper picture that was sent from a remote location by a [[Fax|facsimile telegraph]]. A ''diplomatic telegram'', also known as a [[diplomatic cable]], is the term given to a confidential communication between a [[diplomatic mission]] and the [[Foreign minister|foreign ministry]] of its parent country.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/11/29/10/1796-memos-us-embassy-manila-wikileaks-cablegate |title=1,796 memos from US embassy in Manila in WikiLeaks 'Cablegate' |date=29 November 2010 |accessdate=29 November 2010 |publisher=[[ABS\u2013CBN Corporation]]}}</ref><ref>Definition of \"cable\", {{cite book |title=The Macquarie Dictionary |edition=3rd |year=1997 |publisher=Macquarie Library |location=Australia |isbn=0-949757-89-6 |quote=(n.) 4. a telegram sent abroad, especially by submarine cable.

Commercial electrical telegraphs were introduced from 1837.\n\n===Optical telegraph===\n{{main article|Semaphore line|Flag semaphore}}\n[[File:Construction-pruss-opt-tele.png|thumb|200px|right|Construction schematic of a Prussian optical telegraph (or [[Semaphore line|semaphore]]) tower, C. 1835]]\nThe first telegraphs came in the form of [[optical telegraph]], including the use of [[smoke signals]], [[beacon]]s or [[Heliograph|reflected light]], which have existed since ancient times. Early proposals for an optical telegraph system were made to the [[Royal Society]] by [[Robert Hooke]] in 1684<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/railway/semaphor/semhist.htm |title=The Origin of the Railway Semaphore |publisher=Mysite.du.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}</ref> and were first implemented on an experimental level by Sir [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth]] in 1767.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9eLCsHfKq1IC&dq=Tellograph+edgeworth&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Communications: An International Historyof the Formative Years|author=Burns, Francis W.|year=2004|publisher=IET|accessdate=2013-02-07}}</ref>\n\nThe first successful [[semaphore line|semaphore network]] was invented by [[Claude Chappe]] and operated in France from 1793 through 1846.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9066703/semaphore|title=Semaphore,Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1790\u20131795, at the height of the [[French Revolution]], France needed a swift and reliable communication system to thwart the war efforts of its enemies. In 1790, the Chappe brothers set about devising a system of communication that would allow the central government to receive intelligence and to transmit orders in the shortest possible time. On 2 March 1791 at 11 am, they sent the message \"si vous r\u00e9ussissez, vous serez bient\u00f4t couverts de gloire\" (If you succeed, you will soon bask in glory) between Brulon and Parce, a distance of {{convert|16|km}}. The first means used a combination of black and white panels, clocks, telescopes, and codebooks to send their message.\n\n[[File:Chappe semaphore.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Demonstration of the semaphore]]\nIn 1792 Claude was appointed ''Ing\u00e9nieur-T\u00e9l\u00e9graphiste'' and charged with establishing a line of stations between Paris and [[Lille]], a distance of 230 kilometres (about 143 miles). It was used to carry dispatches for the war between France and Austria. In 1794, it brought news of a French capture of [[Cond\u00e9-sur-l'Escaut]] from the Austrians less than an hour after it occurred.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22909590 How Napoleon's semaphore telegraph changed the world], BBC News, Hugh Schofield, 16 June 2013</ref><!-- Note: this BBC source tell this story well, and supports the Lille and Conde statements, but was not used for the whole section, which remains 'unreferenced' -->\n\nThe [[Prussian semaphore system|Prussian system]] was put into effect in the 1830s. However they were highly dependent on good weather and daylight to work and even then could accommodate only about two words per minute. .

As of 1895, France still operated coastal commercial semaphore telegraph stations, for ship-to-shore communication.<ref>\"A Semaphore Telegraph Station\", ''Scientific American Supplement'', 20 April 1895, page 16087.</ref>\n\n===Electrical telegraphs===\n{{Main article|Electrical telegraph}}\n\n====Early developments====\nThe first suggestion for using electricity as a means of communication appeared in the \"Scots Magazine\" in 1753. Using one wire for each letter of the alphabet, a message could be transmitted by connecting the wire terminals in turn to an electrostatic machine, and observing the deflection of [[pith]] balls at the far end.<ref>E. A. Marland, ''Early Electrical Communication'', Abelard-Schuman Ltd, London 1964, no ISBN, Library of Congress 64-20875, pages 17-19;</ref> Telegraphs employing electrostatic attraction were the basis of early experiments in electrical telegraphy in Europe, but were abandoned as being impractical and were never developed into a useful communication system.\n\nOne very early experiment in electrical telegraphy was an ''electrochemical telegraph'' created by the [[Germans|German]] physician, anatomist, and inventor [[Samuel Thomas von S\u00f6mmering]] in 1809, based on an earlier, less robust design of 1804 by [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[polymath]] and scientist [[Francisco Salva Campillo]].<ref name=\"Harvard1\" /> Both their designs employed multiple wires (up to 35) in order to visually represent most Latin letters and numerals. Thus, messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von S\u00f6mmering's design), with each of the telegraph receiver's wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. As an electric current was applied by the sender representing each digit of a message, it would at the recipient's end electrolyse the acid in its corresponding tube, releasing a stream of hydrogen bubbles next to its associated letter or numeral. The telegraph receiver's operator would visually observe the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message, albeit at a very low [[baud]] rate.<ref name=\"Harvard1\">Jones, R.

Schilling was the first to put into practice the idea of a [[Binary numeral system|binary]] system of [[Transmission (telecommunications)|signal transmissions]].\n\n[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] built the first electromagnetic telegraph used for ''regular'' communication in 1833 in [[G\u00f6ttingen]], connecting G\u00f6ttingen Observatory and the Institute of Physics, covering a distance of about 1&nbsp;km.<ref>R. W. Pohl, Einf\u00fchrung in die Physik, Vol. 3, G\u00f6ttingen (Springer) 1924</ref> The setup consisted of a coil that could be moved up and down over the end of two magnetic steel bars. The resulting induction current was transmitted through two wires to the receiver, consisting of a [[galvanometer]]. The direction of the current could be reversed by commuting the two wires in a special switch. Therefore, Gauss and Weber chose to encode the alphabet in a binary code, using positive and negative currents as the two states.\n\n==Commercial telegraphy==\nTelegraph networks were expensive to build, but financing was readily available, especially from London bankers.

In May 1837 they patented the [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph|Cooke and Wheatstone system]], which used a number of needles on a board that could be moved to point to letters of the alphabet. The patent recommended a five-needle system, but any number of needles could be used depending on the number of characters it was required to code. A four-needle system was installed between [[Euston railway station|Euston]] and [[Camden Town]] in London on a rail line being constructed by [[Robert Stephenson]] between London and Birmingham. It was successfully demonstrated on 25 July 1837.<ref>[http://www.connected-earth.com/journeys/Firstgenerationtechnologies/Thetelegraph/Thetelegraphicagedawns/index.htm The telegraphic age dawns] BT Group Connected Earth Online Museum.

The London and Blackwall Railway (another rope-hauled application) was equipped with the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph when it opened in 1840, and many others followed.<ref>Beauchamp, page 35</ref> The one-needle telegraph proved highly successful on British railways, and 15,000 sets were still in use at the end of the nineteenth century.

The era of mass personal communication had begun.\n\n===Morse system===\n\n[[File:L-Telegraph1.png|thumb|left|200px|A [[Telegraph key|Morse key]]]]\nAn electrical telegraph was independently developed and patented in the [[United States]] in 1837 by [[Samuel Morse]]. His assistant, [[Alfred Vail]], developed the [[Morse code]] signalling [[alphabet]] with Morse. The first telegram in the United States was sent by Morse on 11 January 1838, across two miles (3&nbsp;km) of wire at [[Speedwell Ironworks]] near [[Morristown, New Jersey]], although it was only later, in 1844, that he sent the message \"[[Baltimore-Washington telegraph line|WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT]]\" from the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] in Washington to the [[B&O Railroad Museum|old Mt. Clare Depot]] in Baltimore. From then on, commercial telegraphy took off in America with lines linking all the major metropolitan centres on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] within the next decade. The overland telegraph connected the west coast of the continent to the east coast by 24 October 1861, bringing an end to the [[Pony Express]].\n\nThe Morse telegraphic apparatus was officially adopted as the standard for European telegraphy in 1851. Only Great Britain with its extensive [[British Empire|overseas empire]] kept the needle telegraph of Cooke and Wheatstone.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Franklin and his Electric Kite-Prosecution and Progress of Electrical researches\u2014Historical Sketch of the Electric Telegraph\u2014Claims of Morse and others\u2014Uses of Electricity\u2014Telegraphic Statistics. |url= |quote=It was in the month of J, a century ago, that Franklin made his celebrated experiment with the Electric Kite, by means of which he demonstrated the identity of electricity and lightning. |publisher=New York Times |date=November 11, 1852}}</ref> In 1858, Morse introduced wired communication to Latin America when he established a telegraph system in [[Puerto Rico]], then a Spanish Colony.

This early system required the receiver to be present in real time to record the message and it reached speeds of up to 15 words a minute.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"|Before Telegraphy, a letter by post from London took\n|-\n! days !! to reach <ref>[http://distantwriting.co.uk/companiesandforeigntraffic.html A History of the Telegraph Companies in Britain between 1838-1868 by Steven Roberts]</ref>\n|-\n| 12 || New York in USA\n|-\n| 13 || Alexandria in Egypt\n|-\n| 19 || Constantinople in Ottoman Turkey\n|-\n| 33 || Bombay in India\n|-\n| 44 || Calcutta in Bengal\n|-\n| 45 || Singapore\n|-\n| 57 || Shanghai in China\n|-\n| 73 || Sydney in Australia\n|}\n\nIn 1846, [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] patented a chemical telegraph in [[Edinburgh]].

The system allowed for automatic recording on the receiving end. The system was very stable and accurate and became the accepted around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|title=David Edward Hughes|accessdate=2010-09-29|date=April 14, 2007|publisher=Clarkson University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422072443/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|archivedate=2008-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThe next improvement was the [[Baudot code]] of 1874. French engineer [[\u00c9mile Baudot]] patented a printing telegraph in which the signals were translated automatically into typographic characters. Each character was assigned a unique code based on the sequence of just five contacts. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.<ref>{{cite book | last = Beauchamp | first = K.G. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = History of Telegraphy: Its Technology and Application | publisher = [[Institution of Engineering and Technology|IET]] | year = 2001 | location = | pages = 394\u2013395 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-85296-792-6}}</ref>\n\nBy this point reception had been automated, but the speed and accuracy of the transmission was still limited to the skill of the human operator. The first practical automated system was patented by Charles Wheatstone, the original inventor of the telegraph. The message (in [[Morse code]]) was typed onto a piece of perforated tape using a keyboard-like device called the 'Stick Punch'. The transmitter automatically ran the tape through and transmitted the message at the then exceptionally high speed of 70 words per minute.\n\n===Teleprinters===\n\n{{main article|Teleprinter|Telex}}\n[[File:Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph.jpg|left|thumb|Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph from circa 1880, the last and most advanced telegraphy mechanism designed by [[George May Phelps]]]]\nTeleprinters were invented in order to send and receive messages without the need for operators trained in the use of Morse code. A system of two teleprinters, with one operator trained to use a typewriter, replaced two trained Morse code operators. The teleprinter system improved message speed and delivery time, making it possible for messages to be flashed across a country with little manual intervention.<ref name=\"query.nytimes.com\">{{Citation| title = Typewriter May Soon Be Transmitter of Telegrams\n| newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = January 25, 1914| url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F70D12FF355D13738DDDAC0A94D9405B848DF1D3}}</ref>\n\nEarly teleprinters used the ITA-1 [[Baudot code]], a five-bit code. This yielded only thirty-two codes, so it was over-defined into two \"shifts\", \"letters\" and \"figures\". An explicit, unshared shift code prefaced each set of letters and figures. In 1901 Baudot's code was modified by [[Donald Murray (inventor)|Donald Murray]] and Around 1930, the [[CCITT]] introduced the '''International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2''' ('''ITA2''') code as an international standard.\n\n[[File:Telex.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] T100 Telex machine]]\nBy 1935, message routing was the last great barrier to full automation. Large telegraphy providers began to develop systems that used [[telephone exchange|telephone-like rotary dialling]] to connect teletypewriters.

Between 1886 and 1888 [[Heinrich Rudolf Hertz]] published the results of his experiments where he was able to transmit [[electromagnetic waves]] (radio waves) through the air, proving [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s  1873 theory of [[electromagnetic radiation]].

He would work on the system through 1895 in his lab and then in field tests making improvements to extend its range. After many breakthroughs, including applying the wired telegraphy concept of grounding the transmitter and receiver, Marconi was able, by early 1896, to transmit radio far beyond the short ranges that had been predicted.<ref>Sungook Hong, Wireless: From Marconi's Black-box to the Audion, MIT Press - 2001, page 21</ref> Having failed to interest the [[Italy|Italian]] government, the 22-year-old inventor brought his telegraphy system to Britain in 1896 and met [[William Preece]], a Welshman, who was a major figure in the field and Chief Engineer of the [[General Post Office]].

Some of the ideas developed in this study provided inspiration for the development of the [[ARPANET]] [[packet switching]] research network, which later grew to become the public [[Internet]].\n\nAs the [[Public switched telephone network|PSTN]] became a digital network, [[T-carrier]] \"synchronous\" networks became commonplace in the U.S. A T1 line has a \"frame\" of 193 bits that repeats 8000 times per second. The first bit, called the \"sync\" bit, alternates between 1 and 0 to identify the start of the frames. The rest of the frame provides 8 bits for each of 24 separate voice or data channels. Customarily, a T-1 link is sent over a balanced twisted pair, isolated with transformers to prevent current flow. Europeans adopted a similar system ([[E-carrier|E-1]]) of 32 channels (with one channel for frame synchronisation).\n\nLater, [[Synchronous optical networking|SONET and SDH]] were adapted to combine carrier channels into groups that could be sent over [[optic fiber]]. The capacity of an optic fiber is often extended with [[wavelength division multiplexing]], rather than rerigging new fibre. Rigging several fibres in the same structures as the first fibre is usually easy and inexpensive, and many fibre installations include unused spare \"[[dark fibre]]\", \"dark wavelengths\", and unused parts of the SONET frame, so-called \"virtual channels\".\n\nIn 2002, the Internet was used by [[Kevin Warwick]] at the [[University of Reading]] to communicate neural signals, in purely electronic form, telegraphically between the nervous systems of two humans,<ref>[[Kevin Warwick|Warwick, K]], [[Mark Gasson|Gasson, M]], Hutt, B, Goodhew, I, [[Peter Kyberd|Kyberd, P]], Schulzrinne, H and Wu, X: \"Thought Communication and Control: A First Step using Radiotelegraphy\", ''IEE Proceedings on Communications'', 151(3), pp. 185\u2013189, 2004</ref> potentially opening up a new form of communication combining the Internet and telegraphy.\n\nIn 2006, a well-defined communication channel used for telegraphy was established by the [[SONET]] standard [[OC-768]], which sent about 40 gigabits per second.\n\nThe theoretical maximum capacity of an optic fiber is more than 10<sup>12</sup> bits (one [[terabit]] or one trillion bits) per second.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} In 2006, no existing encoding system approached this theoretical limit, even with wavelength division multiplexing.\n\nSince the Internet operates over any digital transmission medium, further evolution of telegraphic technology will be effectively concealed from users.\n\n===E-mail===\n{{main article|E-mail}}\n[[E-mail]] was first invented for [[Compatible Time Sharing System|CTSS]] and similar time sharing systems of the era in the mid-1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multicians.org/thvv/mail-history.html|title=The History of Electronic Mail|author=Tom Van Vleck}}</ref> At first, e-mail was possible only between different accounts on the same computer (typically a [[mainframe computer|mainframe]]). [[ARPANET]] allowed different computers to be connected to allow e-mails to be relayed from computer to computer, with the first ARPANET e-mail being sent in 1971.<ref>{{cite web|title=The First Network Email|url=http://openmap.bbn.com/~tomlinso/ray/firstemailframe.html|author=Ray Tomlinson}}</ref> [[Multics]] also pioneered instant messaging between computer users in the mid-1970s. With the growth of the Internet, e-mail began to be possible between any two computers with access to the Internet.\n\nVarious private networks like [[UUNET]] (founded 1987), [[WELL (virtual community)|the Well]] (1985), and  [[GEnie]] (1985) had e-mail from the 1970s, but subscriptions were quite expensive for an individual, US$25 to US$50 per month, just for e-mail. Internet use was then largely limited to government, academia and other government contractors until the net was opened to commercial use in the 1980s.\n\nBy the early 1990s, [[modem]]s made e-mail a viable alternative to Telex systems in a business environment. But individual e-mail accounts were not widely available until local Internet service providers were in place, although demand grew rapidly, as e-mail was seen as the Internet's [[killer app]]. It allowed anyone to email anyone, whereas previously, different system had been walled off from each other, such that [[AOL|America Online]] subscribers could email only other America Online subscribers, [[CompuServe|Compuserve]] subscribers could  email only other Compuserve subscribers, etc. The broad user base created by the demand for e-mail smoothed the way for the rapid acceptance of the [[World Wide Web]] in the mid-1990s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} [[Fax]] machines were another technology that helped displace the telegram.\n\nOn Monday, 12 July 1999, a final telegram was sent from the National Liberty Ship Memorial, the [[SS Jeremiah O'Brien]], in San Francisco Bay to President [[Bill Clinton]] in the White House. Officials of Globe Wireless reported that \"The message was 95 words, and it took six or eight minutes to copy it.\" They then transmitted the message to the White House via e-mail. That event was also used to mark the final commercial U.S. ship-to-shore telegraph message transmitted from North America by Globe Wireless, a company founded in 1911.

The telegraph freed communication from the constraints of space and time and revolutionized the global economy and society.<ref>Downey, Gregory J. (2002) ''Telegraph Messenger Boys: Labor, Technology, and Geography, 1850-1950'', Routledge, New York and London, p. 7</ref><ref name=\"eh.net\">Economic History Encyclopedia (2010) \"History of the U.S. Telegraph Industry\", http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/nonnenmacher.industry.telegraphic.us</ref> By the end of the 19th century, the telegraph was becoming an increasingly common medium of communication for ordinary people. The telegraph isolated the message (information) from the physical movement of objects or the process.<ref name=\"Carey, James 1989 p. 210\">Carey, James (1989). ''Communication as Culture'', Routledge, New York and London, p. 210</ref>\n\nTelegraphy facilitated the growth of organizations \"in the railroads, consolidated financial and commodity markets, and reduced information costs within and between firms\".<ref name=\"eh.net\"/> This immense growth in the business sectors influenced society to embrace the use of telegrams.\n\nWorldwide telegraphy changed the gathering of information for news reporting. Messages and information would now travel far and wide, and the telegraph demanded a language \"stripped of the local, the regional; and colloquial\", to better facilitate a worldwide media language.<ref name=\"Carey, James 1989 p. 210\"/> Media language had to be standardized, which led to the gradual disappearance of different forms of speech and styles of [[journalism]] and storytelling.\n\n==Newspaper names==\nNumerous newspapers and news outlets in various countries, such as ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in Britain, [[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|''The Telegraph'']] in India, ''[[De Telegraaf]]'' in the Netherlands and the [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] in the US, were given names which include the word \"telegraph\" due to their having received news by means of electric telegraphy. Some of these names are retained even though more sophisticated means are now used.\n\n==Telegram length==\nThe average length of a telegram in the 1900s in the US was 11.93 words, more than half of the messages were 10 words or fewer.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hochfelder|first1=David|title=The Telegraph in America, 1832\u20131920|date=2012|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUDxx_bMVQUC&pg=PA79}}</ref>\n\nAccording to another study the mean length of the telegrams sent in the UK before 1950 was 14.6 words or 78.8 characters.<ref name=\"Frehner\">{{cite book|last1=Frehner|first1=Carmen|title=Email, SMS, MMS: The Linguistic Creativity of Asynchronous Discourse in the New Media Age|date=2008|publisher=Peter Lang AG|location=Bern|pages=187, 191|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wiVz8dDW8-cC&pg=PA191}}</ref>\n\nFor German telegrams the mean length is 11.5 words or 72.4 characters.<ref name=\"Frehner\"/> At the end of the 19th century the average length of a German telegram was calculated as 14.2 words.<ref name=\"Frehner\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Familygram]]\n* [[David E.
