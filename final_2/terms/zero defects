During the 1990s, large companies in the [[automotive industry]] tried to cut costs by reducing their quality inspection processes and demanding that their suppliers dramatically improve the quality of their supplies.  This eventually resulted in demands for the \"Zero Defects\" standard. It is implemented all over the world.\n\n==Later developments==\nIn 1979, Crosby penned ''Quality Is Free: The Art of Making Quality Certain'' which preserved the idea of Zero Defects in a 14-step quality improvement program and in the concept of the \"Absolutes of Quality Management\".<ref name=\"QualityIsFree\">{{cite book | last = Crosby | first = Philip B. | authorlink = Philip B.

Quality is conformance to requirements====\nEvery product or service has a [[requirement]]: a description of what the customer needs.  When a particular product meets that requirement, it has achieved quality, provided that the requirement accurately describes what the enterprise and the customer actually need.  This technical sense should not be confused with more common usages that indicate weight or goodness or precious materials or some absolute idealized standard.  In common [[parlance]], an inexpensive disposable pen is a lower-quality item than a gold-plated fountain pen.  In the technical sense of Zero Defects, the inexpensive disposable pen is a quality product if it meets requirements: it writes, does not skip or clog under normal use, and lasts the time specified.\n\n====2. Defect prevention is preferable to quality inspection and correction====\nThe second principle is based on the observation that it is nearly always less troublesome, more certain and less expensive to prevent defects than to discover and correct them.\nIt saves a lot of  human power and cost of inspection and correction. For example, if a person changes the poor condition brake shoes of his bike before next riding then it will save a lot of the rider's energy and reduce the risk of accident on the road, not to mention the generation of new defects in the bike due to poorly conditioned brake shoes which when observed later will have a higher cost of repair.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sharma |first=Narender |url=http://shakehandwithlife.blogspot.com/2011/12/philip-crosbys-do-it-right-first-time.html |title=Shakehand with Life: Philip Crosby's : Do It Right First Time and Zero Defects |publisher=Shakehandwithlife.blogspot.com |date=2011-12-16 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>\n\n====3. Zero Defects is the quality standard====\nThe third is based on the normative nature of requirements: if a requirement expresses what is genuinely needed, then any unit that does not meet requirements will not satisfy the need and is no good.  If units that do not meet requirements actually do satisfy the need, then the requirement should be changed to reflect reality.\n\nFurther, the idea that mistakes are inevitable is rejected out of hand.  Just as the CEO wouldn't accept 'mistakenly' not getting paid occasionally, his/her chauffeur 'mistakenly' driving them to the wrong business, or their spouse 'mistakenly' sleeping with someone else, so the company shouldn't take the attitude that they'll 'inevitably' fail to deliver what was promised from time to time.  Aiming at an \"acceptable\" defect level encourages and causes defects.\n\n====4. Quality is measured in monetary terms \u2013 the Price of Nonconformance (PONC)====\nThe fourth principle is key to the methodology.  Phil Crosby believes that every defect represents a cost, which is often [[opportunity cost|hidden]].  These costs include inspection time, rework, wasted material and labor, lost revenue and the cost of customer dissatisfaction.  When properly identified and accounted for, the magnitude of these costs can be made apparent, which has three advantages.  First, it provides a cost-justification for steps to improve quality.  The title of the book, \"Quality is Free,\" expresses the belief that improvements in quality will return savings more than equal to the costs.  Second, it provides a way to measure progress, which is essential to maintaining management commitment and to rewarding employees.  Third, by making the goal measurable, actions can be made concrete and decisions can be made on the basis of relative return.\n\n==Criticisms==\nCriticism of \"Zero Defects\" frequently centers around allegations of extreme cost in meeting the standard.  Proponents say that it is an entirely reachable ideal and that claims of extreme cost result from misapplication of the principles.\n\nPoint 10 of [[W. Edwards Deming#Key principles|Deming's 14 points]] (\"''Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the work force asking for ''zero defects'' and new levels of productivity.''\") is clearly aimed at ZD.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.deming.org/theman/theories/fourteenpoints | title = The Fourteen Points For The Transformation Of Management | last1 = Deming | first1 = W.

The facts were that the bulk of the quality problems had their origin in the managerial and technical processes.  In due course this approach was abandoned, but not before a lot of divisiveness had been generated.}}</ref>\n\nAnother criticism was that Zero Defects was a motivational program aimed at encouraging employees to do better.  Crosby denied ever having said any such thing under any circumstances.  He stated repeatedly that defects occur because of management actions and attitudes.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Six Sigma]]\n*[[Total quality management|Total Quality Management]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book | author = [[American Management Association]] | title = Zero Defects: Doing It Right the First Time | year = 1965 | publisher = American Management Association | location = [[New York City|New York]] | oclc = 244134}}\n*{{cite book | title = A Guide to Zero Defects: Quality and Reliability Assurance Handbook | year = 1965 | publisher = [[United States Assistant Secretary of Defense|Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense]] (Manpower Installations and Logistics) | location = [[Washington, D.C.]] | id = 4155.12-H | oclc = 7188673 | url = http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA950061 | accessdate = 2014-05-29}}\n*{{cite book | last = Halpin | first = James F. | title = Zero Defects: A New Dimension in Quality Assurance | year = 1966 | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | location = [[New York City|New York]] | oclc = 567983091}}\n*{{cite book | editor1-last = Riordan | editor1-first = John J. | title = Zero Defects: the Quest for Quality | year = 1968 | publisher = [[United States Assistant Secretary of Defense|Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense]] | location = [[Washington, D.C.]] | id = Technical Report TR9 | oclc = 3396301 | url = http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/AD0683446 | accessdate = 2014-05-29}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/100years/stories/zero-defects.html Zero Defects at Lockheed Martin, the descendant of the Martin Company]\n*[http://digital.library.temple.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15037coll3/id/5362 Photo of Governor William W.
