(2008) \"scroll\" in ''A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology 1450\u20132000'' Online edition. [[Oxford University Press]], 2008. http://www.oxfordreference.com Retrieved 21 November 2013.</ref>\n\n==Structure==\nA scroll is usually divided up into pages, which are sometimes separate sheets of papyrus or parchment glued together at the edges, or may be marked divisions of a continuous roll of [[writing material]]. The scroll is usually unrolled so that one page is exposed at a time, for writing or reading, with the remaining pages rolled up to the left and right of the visible page. It is unrolled from side to side, and the text is written in lines from the top to the bottom of the page. Depending on the language, the letters may be written left to right, right to left, or alternating in direction ([[boustrophedon]]).\n\nSome scrolls are simply rolled up pages; others may have wooden rollers on each end: [[Torah]] scrolls have rather elaborate rollers befitting their ceremonial function.\n\n==History of scroll use==\n{{Main|History of scrolls}}\n{{double image|right|Giovane con rotolo.JPG|150|MANNapoli 120620 a Fresco young man with rolls from Pompeii Italy.jpg|150|[[Roman portraiture]] [[fresco]]s from [[Pompeii]], 1st century AD, depicting two different men wearing [[laurel wreath]]s, one holding the ''[[rotulus]]'', the other a ''[[History of scrolls|volumen]]''}}\nScrolls were the first form of editable record keeping texts, used in Eastern Mediterranean [[ancient Egyptian civilization]]s.\n\nParchment scroll used by Israelites after Sinai was the first use of scrolls in the recording of literature before the [[codex]] or bound [[book]] with pages was invented by the [[Latins]] in the 1st century AD.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Scrolls were more highly regarded than codices until well into Roman times where they were usually written in single latitudinal column.\n\nThe ink used in writing scrolls had to adhere to a surface that was rolled and unrolled, so special inks were developed. Even so, ink would slowly flake off of scrolls.\n\n==Rolls==\nShorter pieces of [[parchment]] or [[paper]] are called rolls or [[Rotulus|rotuli]], although usage of the term by modern historians varies with periods.  Historians of the classical period tend to use \"roll\" instead of \"scroll\".  Rolls may still be many meters or feet long, and were used in the medieval and Early Modern period in Europe and various West Asian cultures for [[manuscript]] administrative documents intended for various uses, including accounting, rent-rolls, legal agreements, and inventories. A distinction that sometimes applies is that the lines of writing in rotuli run across the width of the roll (that is to say, are parallel with any unrolled portion) rather than along the length, divided into page-like sections. Rolls may be wider than most scrolls, up to perhaps 60&nbsp;cm or two feet wide.  Rolls were often stored together in a special cupboard on shelves.\n\nA special Chinese form of short book, called the \"whirlwind book,\" consists of several pieces of paper bound at the top with bamboo and then rolled up.<ref>[http://idp.bl.uk/education/bookbinding/bookbinding.a4d International Dunhuang Project - Chinese scroll and \"whirlwind\" forms from the 10th century]</ref>\n\n==In Scotland==\nIn Scotland the term ''scrow'' was used from about the thirteenth to the seventeenth century for scroll, writing, or documents in list or schedule form. There existed an office of Clerk of the Scrow (''Rotulorum Clericus'') meaning the Clerk of the Rolls or Clerk of the Register.<ref>Beal, 2008, \"scrow\".</ref>\n\n==Replacement by the codex==\nThe scroll was largely replaced by the [[codex]], a process which started almost as soon as the codex was invented. For example, in Egypt by the fifth century, the codex outnumbered the scroll or roll by ten to one based on surviving examples, and by the sixth century the scroll had almost vanished from use as a vehicle for literature.<ref>Roberts, Colin H., and Skeat, T.C. (1987), ''The Birth of the Codex''. London: [[Oxford University Press]] for the [[British Academy]], p. 75.</ref>  Unfortunately, scrolls were usually discarded after their contents were transferred to a codex.  Most scrolls uncovered by archaeologists are found in trash middens and burial sites.<ref>Murray, Stuart A.P., (2012), ''The Library: An Illustrated History''. Chicago: [[Skyhorse Publishing]], p.27.</ref>\n\n==Recent discovery==\nThe oldest complete Torah scroll was recently discovered in May 2013 by Professor Mauro Perani. It was stored in an academic library in Bolonia, Italy. It had been mislabeled in 1889 as dating from the 17th century. Carbon testing dates the prayer book to the year 840, which is 300 to 400 years earlier than the previously oldest known Torah scrolls from the 12th and 13th centuries. \n\nThe scroll is made up of 58 sections of soft sheep leather. It is 36 meters long and 64 centimeters wide. It was written in an archaic form of Hebrew, on pages of aged parchment. The text includes 100 Jewish blessings and discusses topics such as the apocalyptic tale of the End Times and the Passover Seder.<ref>[http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2013-06/oldest-complete-scroll-torah-found-italy Oldest complete scroll of Torah found in Italy]. (2013). Christian Century, 130(13), 17</ref>\n\n==Modern technology ==\nModern technology may be able to assist in reading ancient scrolls. In January 2015, computer software may be making progress in reading 2,000-year-old Herculaneum scrolls, computer scientists report. After working for more than 10 years on unlocking the contents of damaged [[Herculaneum_papyri|Herculaneum scrolls]], researchers may be able to progress towards reading the scrolls, which cannot be physically opened.<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/01/150122114405.htm Major breakthrough in reading ancient scrolls], ''[[Science Daily]]'' </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Codex]]\n*[[Hanging scroll]]\n*[[Handscroll]]\n*[[Herculaneum papyri]]\n*[[Paleography]]\n*[[Papyrus]]\n*[[Parchment]]\n*[[Sefer Torah]]\n*[[Vellum]]\n*[[Woodblock printing]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Commons category|scrolls}}\n*[http://scrolls.uchicago.edu/ Digital Scrolling Paintings Project]\n*[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/scroll/scrollcodex.html Encyclopaedia Romana: \"Scroll and codex\"]\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Books by type]]\n[[Category:Scribes]]\n[[Category:Manuscripts by type]]\n[[Category:Textual scholarship]]"}]}}}}
