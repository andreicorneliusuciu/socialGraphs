Often the seven segments are arranged in an ''[[oblique type|oblique]]'' (slanted) arrangement, which aids readability. In most applications, the seven segments are of nearly uniform shape and size (usually elongated [[hexagon]]s, though [[trapezoid]]s and [[rectangle]]s can also be used), though in the case of [[adding machine]]s, the vertical segments are longer and more oddly shaped at the ends in an effort to further enhance readability.\n\nThe numerals 6 and 9 may be represented by two different glyphs on seven-segment displays, with or without a 'tail'.\n\nThe seven segments are arranged as a rectangle of two vertical segments on each side with one horizontal segment on the top, middle, and bottom. Additionally, the seventh segment bisects the rectangle horizontally. There are also [[fourteen-segment display]]s and [[sixteen-segment display]]s (for full [[wikt:alphanumeric|alphanumeric]]s); however, these have mostly been replaced by dot matrix displays. Twenty-two segment displays<ref>{{cite web|title=DL-3422 4-digit 22-segment alphanumeric Intelligent Display\u2122 preliminary data sheet|url=https://archive.org/stream/bitsavers_litronixdaOptoelectronicsCatalog_31011858/1982_Litronix_Optoelectronics_Catalog#page/n81/mode/2up|website=Internet Archive|publisher=Litronix 1982 Optoelectronics Catalog|accessdate=3 September 2016|page=82}}</ref> were briefly available in the early 1980s, but did not prove popular.\n\nThe segments of a 7-segment display are referred to by the letters A to G, where the optional [[decimal point]] (an \"eighth segment\", referred to as DP) is used for the display of non-integer numbers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sentex.ca/~mec1995/tutorial/7seg/7seg.html |title=Seven Segment Displays |accessdate=2012-11-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |date=1999|title=Elektrotechnik Tabellen Kommunikationselektronik |edition=3rd |publisher=Westermann |location=Braunschweig, Germany |isbn=3142250379 |page=110}}</ref>\n\n== Implementations ==\n{{double image\n|1=right\n|2=Incandescent light seven-segment display.jpg\n|3=150\n|4=Fuel prices.jpg\n|5=150\n|6=An incandescent filament-type early seven-segment display, a.k.a.

For [[gasoline]] price totems and other large signs, [[vane display]]s made up of electromagnetically flipped light-reflecting segments (or \"vanes\") are still commonly used. An alternative to the 7-segment display in the 1950s through the 1970s was the cold-cathode, neon-lamp-like [[nixie tube]]. Starting in 1970, [[RCA]] sold a display device known as the ''{{Visible anchor|Numitron}}'' that used incandescent filaments arranged into a seven-segment display.<ref name=\"Numintron 1974\">{{cite journal |date=June 7, 1974 |title=advert for RCA NUMITRON Display Devices |journal=Electronic Design |publisher=Hayden |volume=22 |issue=12 |page=163 |url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RCA_Numitron_display_device_June_1974.jpg}}</ref>\n\nIn a simple LED package, typically all of the [[cathode]]s (negative terminals) or all of the [[anode]]s (positive terminals) of the segment LEDs are connected and brought out to a common pin; this is referred to as a \"common cathode\" or \"common anode\" device.<ref>{{cite book |date=1999 |title=Elektrotechnik Tabellen Kommunikationselektronik |edition=3rd |publisher=Westermann |location=Braunschweig, Germany |isbn=3142250379 |page=110}}</ref> Hence a 7 segment plus decimal point package will only require nine pins, though commercial products typically contain more pins, and/or spaces where pins would go, in order to match standard [[integrated circuit|IC]] sockets. Integrated displays also exist, with single or multiple digits. Some of these integrated displays incorporate their own internal [[binary decoder|decoder]], though most do not: each individual LED is brought out to a connecting pin as described.\n[[File:LED Digital Display.jpg|thumb|right|A [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] 4-digit, seven-segment display with only 12 pins]]\nMultiple-digit LED displays as used in pocket calculators and similar devices used [[multiplexed display]]s to reduce the number of I/O pins required to control the display. For example, all the anodes of the A segments of each digit position would be connected together and to a [[driver circuit]] pin, while the cathodes of all segments for each digit would be connected. To operate any particular segment of any digit, the controlling integrated circuit would turn on the cathode driver for the selected digit, and the anode drivers for the desired segments; then after a short blanking interval the next digit would be selected and new segments lit, in a sequential fashion. In this manner an eight digit display with seven segments and a decimal point would require only 8 cathode drivers and 8 anode drivers, instead of sixty-four drivers and IC pins.<ref>e.g. [http://pdf1.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/view/170106/VISHAY/TDCR1050M.html DCR 1050m]</ref> Often in pocket calculators the digit drive lines would be used to scan the keyboard as well, providing further savings; however, pressing multiple keys at once would produce odd results on the multiplexed display.\n\nA single byte can encode the full state of a 7-segment-display. The most popular bit encodings are ''gfedcba'' and ''abcdefg'', where each letter represents a particular segment in the display. In the ''gfedcba'' representation, a byte value of 0x06 would (in a common anode circuit) turn on segments 'c' and 'b', which would display a '1'.\n\n== History ==\n\nSeven-segment representation of figures can be found in [[patent]]s as early as 1903 (in {{US patent|1126641}}), when Carl Kinsley invented a method of telegraphically transmitting letters and numbers and having them printed on tape in a segmented format. In 1908, F W Wood invented an 8-segment display, which displayed the number 4 using a diagonal bar ({{US patent|974943}}). In 1910, a seven-segment display illuminated by incandescent bulbs was used on a power-plant boiler room signal panel.<ref>Warren O. Rogers, Power Plant Signalling System, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0sIfAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA204 Power and the Engineer], Vol. 32, No. 5 (Feb. 1, 1910); pages 204-206.</ref> They were also used to show the dialed telephone number to operators during the transition from manual to automatic telephone dialing.<ref>E. H. Clark, Evolution of the Call-Indicator System, [http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Bell-Laboratories-Record/20s/Bell-Laboratories-Record-1929-12.pdf Bell Laboratories Record], Vol 8, No. 5 (December 1929); pages 171-173</ref> They did not achieve widespread use until the advent of LEDs in the 1970s.\n\nThey are sometimes used in posters or tags, where the user either applies color to pre-printed segments, or applies color through a seven-segment digit [[stencil|template]], to compose figures such as product prices or telephone numbers.\n\nFor many applications, dot-matrix LCDs have largely superseded LED displays, though even in LCDs 7-segment displays are very common. Unlike LEDs, the shapes of elements in an LCD panel are arbitrary since they are formed on the display by a kind of printing process. In contrast, the shapes of LED segments tend to be simple [[rectangle]]s, reflecting the fact that they have to be physically moulded to shape, which makes it difficult to form more complex shapes than the segments of 7-segment displays. However, the high common recognition factor of 7-segment displays, and the comparatively high visual [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] obtained by such displays relative to dot-matrix digits, makes seven-segment multiple-digit LCD screens very common on basic [[calculator]]s.\n\nThe seven-segment display has inspired [[type design]]ers to produce\ntypefaces reminiscent of that display (but more legible), such as\n[[New Alphabet (typeface)]],\n\"DB LCD Temp\",\n\"ION B\",\netc.\n\n== Displaying letters ==\n[[File:7-segments Indicator.gif|thumb|LED-based 7 segment display which cycles through the common glyphs of the ten decimal numerals and the six [[hexadecimal]] \"letter digits\" (A, b, C, d, E, F)]]\n\n[[Hexadecimal]] digits can be displayed on seven-segment displays.
