The ruler at the top is for size comparison.]]\nAn '''electronic component''' is any basic '''discrete device''' or physical entity in an electronic system used to affect [[electrons]] or their associated fields. Electronic components are mostly industrial products, available in a singular form and are not to be confused with [[electrical element]]s, which are conceptual abstractions representing idealized electronic components.\n\nElectronic components have two or more electrical [[terminal (electronics)|terminal]]s (or ''[[lead (electronics)|lead]]s'') aside from [[radio antenna|antennas]] which may only have one terminal. These leads connect to create an [[electrical network|electronic circuit]]  with a particular function (for example an [[amplifier]], [[receiver (radio)|radio receiver]], or [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]]). Basic electronic components may be packaged discretely, as arrays or networks of like components, or integrated inside of packages such as [[semiconductor]] [[integrated circuit]]s, [[hybrid integrated circuit]]s, or [[thick film technology|thick film]] devices. The following list of electronic components focuses on the discrete version of these components, treating such packages as components in their own right.\n\n==Classification==\nComponents can be classified as [[passivity (engineering)|passive, active]], or electromechanic. The strict physics definition treats passive components as ones that cannot supply energy themselves, whereas a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] would be seen as an active component since it truly acts as a source of energy.\n\nHowever, [[electronic engineer]]s who perform [[circuit analysis]] use a more restrictive definition of [[passivity (engineering)#Incremental passivity|passivity]]. When only concerned with the energy of [[signal (electronics)|signal]]s, it is convenient to ignore the so-called [[direct current|DC]] circuit and pretend that the power supplying components such as [[transistor]]s or [[integrated circuit]]s is absent (as if each such component had its own battery built in), though it may in reality be supplied by the DC circuit. Then, the analysis only concerns the AC circuit, an abstraction that ignores DC voltages and currents (and the power associated with them) present in the real-life circuit. This fiction, for instance, lets us view an oscillator as \"producing energy\" even though in reality the oscillator consumes even more energy from a DC power supply, which we have chosen to ignore. Under that restriction, we define the terms as used in [[circuit analysis]] as:\n* '''Active components''' rely on a source of energy (usually from the DC circuit, which we have chosen to ignore) and usually can inject power into a circuit, though this is not part of the definition.<ref>For instance, a computer could be contained inside a black box with two external terminals. It might do various calculations and signal its results by varying its resistance, but always consuming power as a resistance does. Nevertheless, it's an ''active'' component, since it relies on a power source to operate.</ref> <ref> javaTpoint.com </ref>Active components include amplifying components such as [[transistor]]s, triode [[vacuum tube]]s (valves), and [[tunnel diode]]s.\n* '''Passive components''' can't introduce net energy into the circuit. They also can't rely on a source of power, except for what is available from the (AC) circuit they are connected to. As a consequence they can't amplify (increase the power of a signal), although they may increase a voltage or current (such as is done by a transformer or resonant circuit). Passive components include two-terminal components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, and transformers.\n* '''[[Electromechanics|Electromechanical components]]''' can carry out electrical operations by using moving parts or by using electrical connections\n\nMost passive components with more than two terminals can be described in terms of [[two-port parameters]] that satisfy the principle of [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|reciprocity]]\u2014though there are rare exceptions.<ref>Nonreciprocal passive devices include the [[gyrator]] (though as a truly passive component, this exists more in theoretical terms, and is usually implemented using an active circuit)\u2014and the [[circulator]], which is used at microwave and optical frequencies</ref> In contrast, active components (with more than two terminals) generally lack that property.\n\n==Active components==\nThe electronic components which are perform on the core electronic function like amplification, electronic switching, electronic controlling and the components acts upon a source of current are  active component.\n\n=== Semiconductors ===\n\n==== Diodes ====\n[[File:Verschiedene LEDs.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Various examples of Light-emitting diodes]]\nConduct electricity easily in one direction, among more specific behaviors. \n*[[Diode]], [[Rectifier]], [[Bridge rectifier]]\n*[[Schottky diode|Schottky diode, hot carrier diode]] \u2013 super fast diode with lower forward voltage drop\n*[[Zener diode]] \u2013 Passes current in reverse direction to provide a constant voltage reference\n*[[Transient voltage suppression diode]] (TVS), Unipolar or Bipolar \u2013 used to absorb high-voltage spikes\n*[[Varicap|Varactor, Tuning diode, Varicap, Variable capacitance diode]] \u2013 A diode whose AC capacitance varies according to the DC voltage applied.\n*[[Light-emitting diode]] (LED) \u2013 A diode that emits light\n*[[Photodiode]] \u2013 Passes current in proportion to incident light\n**[[Avalanche photodiode]] Photodiode with internal gain\n**[[Solar cell|Solar Cell, photovoltaic cell, PV array]] or panel, produces power from light\n*[[DIAC]] (Diode for Alternating Current), Trigger Diode, SIDAC) \u2013 Often used to trigger an SCR\n*[[Constant-current diode]]\n*[[Peltier cooler]] \u2013 A semiconductor [[heat pump]]\n*[[Tunnel diode]] - very fast diode based on quantum mechanical tunneling\n\n==== Transistors ====\nTransistors were considered the invention of the twentieth century that changed electronic circuits forever.
