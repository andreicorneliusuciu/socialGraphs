The right-angles between crystal faces are due to the cubic symmetry of the atoms' arrangement.}}\n{{Main article|Crystal structure}}\nThe scientific definition of a \"crystal\" is based on the microscopic arrangement of atoms inside it, called the [[crystal structure]]. A crystal is a solid where the atoms form a periodic arrangement. ([[Quasicrystal]]s are an exception, see [[#Quasicrystals|below]].)\n\nNot all solids are crystals. For example, when liquid water starts freezing, the phase change begins with small ice crystals that grow until they fuse, forming a ''[[polycrystalline]]'' structure. In the final block of ice, each of the small crystals (called \"[[crystallite]]s\" or \"grains\") is a true crystal with a periodic arrangement of atoms, but the whole polycrystal does ''not'' have a periodic arrangement of atoms, because the periodic pattern is broken at the [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]]. Most macroscopic [[inorganic]] solids are polycrystalline, including almost all [[metal]]s, [[ceramic]]s, [[ice]], [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], etc. Solids that are neither crystalline nor polycrystalline, such as [[glass]], are called ''[[amorphous solid]]s'', also called [[glass]]y, vitreous, or noncrystalline. These have no periodic order, even microscopically. There are distinct differences between crystalline solids and amorphous solids: most notably, the process of forming a glass does not release the [[latent heat of fusion]], but forming a crystal does.\n\nA crystal structure (an arrangement of atoms in a crystal) is characterized by its ''unit cell'', a small imaginary box containing one or more atoms in a specific spatial arrangement. The unit cells are [[honeycomb (geometry)|stacked]] in three-dimensional space to form the crystal.\n\nThe [[crystal structure|symmetry of a crystal]] is constrained by the requirement that the unit cells stack perfectly with no gaps. There are 219 possible crystal symmetries, called [[Space group|crystallographic space groups]]. These are grouped into 7 [[crystal system]]s, such as [[cubic crystal system]] (where the crystals may form cubes or rectangular boxes, such as [[halite]] shown at right) or [[hexagonal crystal system]] (where the crystals may form hexagons, such as [[Ice Ih|ordinary water ice]]).\n\n== Crystal faces and shapes ==\n[[File:Crystal facet formation.svg|thumb|350px|As a [[halite]] crystal is growing, new atoms can very easily attach to the parts of the surface with rough atomic-scale structure and many [[dangling bonds]]. Therefore, these parts of the crystal grow out very quickly (yellow arrows). Eventually, the whole surface consists of smooth, [[surface energy|stable]] faces, where new atoms cannot as easily attach themselves.]]\nCrystals are commonly recognized by their shape, consisting of flat faces with sharp angles. These shape characteristics are not ''necessary'' for a crystal\u2014a crystal is scientifically defined by its microscopic atomic arrangement, not its macroscopic shape\u2014but the characteristic macroscopic shape is often present and easy to see.\n\n[[Euhedral]] crystals are those with obvious, well-formed flat faces. [[Anhedral (petrology)|Anhedral]] crystals do not, usually because the crystal is one grain in a polycrystalline solid.\n\nThe flat faces (also called [[facet]]s) of a [[euhedral]] crystal are oriented in a specific way relative to the underlying [[crystal structure|atomic arrangement of the crystal]]: they are [[plane (mathematics)|planes]] of relatively low [[Miller index]].<ref>''The surface science of metal oxides'', by Victor E. Henrich, P. A. Cox, page 28, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X6x1MmPisKkC&pg=PA2 google books link]</ref> This occurs because some surface orientations are more stable than others (lower [[surface energy]]). As a crystal grows, new atoms attach easily to the rougher and less stable parts of the surface, but less easily to the flat, stable surfaces. Therefore, the flat surfaces tend to grow larger and smoother, until the whole crystal surface consists of these plane surfaces. (See diagram on right.)\n\nOne of the oldest techniques in the science of [[crystallography]] consists of measuring the three-dimensional orientations of the faces of a crystal, and using them to infer the underlying [[crystal system|crystal symmetry]].\n\nA [[Crystal habit|crystal's habit]] is its visible external shape. This is determined by the [[crystal structure]] (which restricts the possible facet orientations), the specific crystal chemistry and bonding (which may favor some facet types over others), and the conditions under which the crystal formed.\n\n== Occurrence in nature ==\n[[File:Ice crystals.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ice]] crystals.]]\n[[File:CalciteEchinosphaerites.jpg|thumb|[[Fossil]] [[Animal shell|shell]] with [[calcite]] crystals.]]\n\n=== Rocks ===\nBy volume and weight, the largest concentrations of crystals in the Earth are part of its solid [[bedrock]]. Crystals found in rocks typically range in size from a fraction of a millimetre to several centimetres across, although exceptionally large crystals are occasionally found.  {{As of|1999}}, the world's largest known naturally occurring crystal is a crystal of [[beryl]] from Malakialina, [[Madagascar]], {{convert|18|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3.5|m|abbr=on}} in diameter, and weighing {{convert|380,000|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref>G. Cressey and I. F. Mercer, (1999) ''Crystals'', London, Natural History Museum, page 58</ref>\n\nSome crystals have formed by [[magmatic]] and [[metamorphic]] processes, giving origin to large masses of crystalline [[rock (geology)|rock]]. The vast majority of [[igneous rocks]] are formed from molten magma and the degree of crystallization depends primarily on the conditions under which they solidified. Such rocks as [[granite]], which have cooled very slowly and under great pressures, have completely crystallized; but many kinds of [[lava]] were poured out at the surface and cooled very rapidly, and in this latter group a small amount of amorphous or [[glass]]y matter is common. Other crystalline rocks, the metamorphic rocks such as [[marble]]s, [[mica-schist]]s and [[quartzite]]s, are recrystallized. This means that they were at first fragmental rocks like [[limestone]], [[shale]] and [[sandstone]] and have never been in a [[molten]] condition nor entirely in solution, but the high temperature and pressure conditions of [[metamorphism]] have acted on them by erasing their original structures and inducing recrystallization in the solid state.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|title=Petrology |inline=1}}</ref>\n\nOther rock crystals have formed out of precipitation from fluids, commonly water, to form [[druse (geology)|druses]] or [[quartz]] veins.\nThe [[evaporite]]s such as [[halite]], [[gypsum]] and some limestones have been deposited from aqueous solution, mostly owing to [[evaporation]] in arid climates.\n\n=== Ice ===\nWater-based [[ice]] in the form of [[snow]], [[sea ice]] and [[glacier]]s is a very common manifestation of crystalline or polycrystalline matter on Earth. A single [[snowflake]] is typically a single crystal, while an [[ice cube]] is a [[polycrystal]].\n\n=== Organigenic crystals ===\nMany living [[organisms]] are able to produce crystals, for example [[calcite]] and [[aragonite]] in the case of most [[mollusc]]s or [[hydroxylapatite]] in the case of [[vertebrate]]s.\n\n== Polymorphism and allotropy ==\n{{Main article|Polymorphism (materials science)|Allotropy}}\nThe same group of atoms can often solidify in many different ways. [[Polymorphism (materials science)|Polymorphism]] is the ability of a solid to exist in more than one crystal form. For example, water [[ice]] is ordinarily found in the hexagonal form [[Ice Ih|Ice I<sub>h</sub>]], but can also exist as the cubic [[ice Ic|Ice I<sub>c</sub>]], the [[rhombohedral]] [[ice II]], and many other forms. The different polymorphs are usually called different ''[[Phase (matter)|phases]]''.\n\nIn addition, the same atoms may be able to form noncrystalline [[Phase (matter)|phases]]. For example, water can also form [[amorphous ice]], while SiO<sub>2</sub> can form both [[fused silica]] (an amorphous glass) and [[quartz]] (a crystal). Likewise, if a substance can form crystals, it can also form polycrystals.\n\nFor pure chemical elements, polymorphism is known as [[allotropy]]. For example, [[diamond]] and [[graphite]] are two crystalline forms of [[carbon]], while [[amorphous carbon]] is a noncrystalline form. Polymorphs, despite having the same atoms, may have wildly different properties. For example, diamond is among the hardest substances known, while graphite is so soft that it is used as a lubricant.\n\n[[Polyamorphism]] is a similar phenomenon where the same atoms can exist in more than one [[amorphous solid]] form.\n\n== Crystallization ==\n{{Main article|Crystallization|Crystal growth}}\n[[File:1-cooling-crystallizer-schladen.JPG|thumb|upright|Vertical [[Crystallization|cooling crystallizer]] in a beet sugar factory.]]\nCrystallization is the process of forming a crystalline structure from a fluid or from materials dissolved in a fluid. (More rarely, crystals may be [[Deposition (phase transition)|deposited]] directly from gas; see [[thin-film deposition]] and [[epitaxy]].)\n\nCrystallization is a complex and extensively-studied field, because depending on the conditions, a single fluid can solidify into many different possible forms. It can form a [[single crystal]], perhaps with various possible [[phase (matter)|phases]], [[stoichiometry|stoichiometries]], impurities, [[Crystallographic defect|defects]], and [[crystal habit|habits]]. Or, it can form a [[polycrystal]], with various possibilities for the size, arrangement, orientation, and phase of its grains. The final form of the solid is determined by the conditions under which the fluid is being solidified, such as the chemistry of the fluid, the [[ambient pressure]], the [[temperature]], and the speed with which all these parameters are changing.\n\nSpecific industrial techniques to produce large single crystals (called ''[[boule (crystal)|boules]]'') include the [[Czochralski process]] and the [[Bridgman technique]]. Other less exotic methods of crystallization may be used, depending on the physical properties of the substance, including [[hydrothermal synthesis]], [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]], or simply [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|solvent-based crystallization]].\n\nLarge single crystals can be created by geological processes. For example, [[Selenite (mineral)|selenite]] crystals in excess of 10 [[meter]]s are found in the [[Cave of the Crystals]] in Naica, Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/11/crystal-giants/shea-text|title=Cave of Crystal Giants \u2014 National Geographic Magazine|work=nationalgeographic.com}}</ref> For more details on geological crystal formation, see [[#Rocks|above]].\n\nCrystals can also be formed by biological processes, see [[#Organigenic crystals|above]]. Conversely, some organisms have special techniques to ''prevent'' crystallization from occurring, such as [[antifreeze protein]]s.\n\n== Defects, impurities, and twinning ==\n{{Main article|Crystallographic defect|Impurity|Crystal twinning|Mosaicity}}\n[[File:Vector de Burgers.PNG|upright|thumb|left|Two types of crystallographic defects. <u>Top right:</u> [[edge dislocation]]. <u>Bottom right:</u> [[screw dislocation]].]]\nAn ''ideal'' crystal has every atom in a perfect, exactly repeating pattern. However, in reality, most crystalline materials have a variety of [[crystallographic defect]]s, places where the crystal's pattern is interrupted. The types and structures of these defects may have a profound effect on the properties of the materials.\n\nA few examples of crystallographic defects include [[vacancy defect]]s (an empty space where an atom should fit), [[interstitial defect]]s (an extra atom squeezed in where it does not fit), and [[dislocation]]s (see figure at right). Dislocations are especially important in [[materials science]], because they help determine the [[Strength of materials|mechanical strength of materials]].\n\nAnother common type of crystallographic defect is an [[impurity]], meaning that the \"wrong\" type of atom is present in a crystal. For example, a perfect crystal of [[diamond]] would only contain [[carbon]] atoms, but a real crystal might perhaps contain a few [[boron]] atoms as well. These boron impurities change the [[diamond color|diamond's color]] to slightly blue. Likewise, the only difference between [[ruby]] and [[sapphire]] is the type of impurities present in a [[corundum]] crystal.\n\n[[File:Pyrite 60608.jpg|thumb||[[Crystal twinning|Twinned]] [[pyrite]] crystal group.]]\nIn [[semiconductor]]s, a special type of impurity, called a [[dopant]], drastically changes the crystal's electrical properties. [[Semiconductor device]]s, such as [[transistor]]s, are made possible largely by putting different semiconductor dopants into different places, in specific patterns.\n\n[[Crystal twinning|Twinning]] is a phenomenon somewhere between a crystallographic defect and a [[grain boundary]]. Like a grain boundary, a twin boundary has different crystal orientations on its two sides. But unlike a grain boundary, the orientations are not random, but related in a specific, mirror-image way.\n\n[[Mosaicity]] is a spread of crystal plane orientations. A [[mosaicity|mosaic crystal]] is supposed to consist of smaller crystalline units that are somewhat misaligned with respect to each other.\n\n== Chemical bonds ==\nIn general, solids can be held together by various types of [[chemical bond]]s, such as [[metallic bond]]s, [[ionic bond]]s, [[covalent bond]]s, [[van der Waals bond]]s, and others. None of these are necessarily crystalline or non-crystalline. However, there are some general trends as follows.\n\n[[Metal]]s are almost always polycrystalline, though there are exceptions like [[amorphous metal]] and single-crystal metals. The latter are grown synthetically. (A microscopically-small piece of metal may naturally form into a single crystal, but larger pieces generally do not.) [[Ionic bond|Ionically bonded]] solids are usually crystalline or polycrystalline. In practice, large [[salt]] crystals can be created by solidification of a [[molten]] fluid, or by crystallization out of a solution. [[Covalent]]ly bonded crystals are also very common, notable examples being [[diamond]], [[quartz]], and [[graphite]]. [[Polymer]] materials generally will form crystalline regions, but the lengths of the molecules usually prevent complete crystallization\u2014and sometimes polymers are completely amorphous. Weak [[van der Waals force]]s also help hold together certain crystals, including [[graphite]].\n\n== Quasicrystals ==\n[[File:Ho-Mg-ZnQuasicrystal.jpg|thumb|The material [[Holmium\u2013magnesium\u2013zinc quasicrystal|holmium\u2013magnesium\u2013zinc]] (Ho\u2013Mg\u2013Zn) forms [[quasicrystal]]s, which can take on the macroscopic shape of a [[dodecahedron]]. (Only a quasicrystal, not a normal crystal, can take this shape.) The edges are 2&nbsp;mm long.]]\n{{Main article|Quasicrystal}}\nA [[quasicrystal]] consists of arrays of atoms that are ordered but not strictly periodic. They have many attributes in common with ordinary crystals, such as displaying a discrete pattern in [[x-ray diffraction]], and the ability to form shapes with smooth, flat faces.\n\nQuasicrystals are most famous for their ability to show five-fold symmetry, which is impossible for an ordinary periodic crystal (see [[crystallographic restriction theorem]]).\n\nThe [[International Union of Crystallography]] has redefined the term \"crystal\" to include both ordinary periodic crystals and quasicrystals (\"any solid having an essentially discrete [[diffraction]] diagram\"<ref>{{cite journal |author=International Union of Crystallography |year=1992 |title=Report of the Executive Committee for 1991 |journal=Acta Crystallogr.

Only about 100 solids are known to form quasicrystals, compared to about 400,000 periodic crystals known in 2004.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Steurer W.|journal= Z.

These properties are related to the [[anisotropy]] of the crystal, i.e. the lack of rotational symmetry in its atomic arrangement. One such property is the [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric effect]], where a voltage across the crystal can shrink or stretch it. Another is [[birefringence]], where a double image appears when looking through a crystal. Moreover, various properties of a crystal, including [[electrical conductivity]], [[electrical permittivity]], and [[Young's modulus]], may be different in different directions in a crystal. For example, [[graphite]] crystals consist of a stack of sheets, and although each individual sheet is mechanically very strong, the sheets are rather loosely bound to each other. Therefore, the mechanical strength of the material is quite different depending on the direction of stress.\n\nNot all crystals have all of these properties. Conversely, these properties are not quite exclusive to crystals. They can appear in [[glass]]es or [[polycrystal]]s that have been made [[anisotropic]] by [[Work hardening|working]] or [[stress (mechanics)|stress]]\u2014for example, [[photoelasticity|stress-induced birefringence]].\n\n== Crystallography ==\n{{Main article|Crystallography}}\n''[[Crystallography]]'' is the science of measuring the [[crystal structure]] (in other words, the atomic arrangement) of a crystal. One widely used crystallography technique is [[X-ray diffraction]]. Large numbers of known crystal structures are stored in [[crystallographic database]]s.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery heights=200 widths=200>\nFile:Insulincrystals.jpg|[[Insulin]] crystals [[space manufacturing|grown in earth orbit]].\nFile:Hoar frost macro2.jpg|[[Hoar frost]]: A type of ice crystal (picture taken from a distance of about 5&nbsp;cm).\nFile:Gallium1 640x480.jpg|[[Gallium]], a metal that easily forms large crystals.\nFile:Apatite-Rhodochrosite-Fluorite-169799.jpg|An apatite crystal sits front and center on cherry-red rhodochroite rhombs, purple fluorite cubes, quartz and a dusting of brass-yellow pyrite cubes.\nFile:Monokristalines Silizium f\u00fcr die Waferherstellung.jpg|[[Boule (crystal)|Boules]] of [[silicon]], like this one, are an important type of industrially-produced [[single crystal]].\nFile:Bornite-Chalcopyrite-Pyrite-180794.jpg|A specimen consisting of a bornite-coated chalcopyrite crystal nestled in a bed of clear quartz crystals and lustrous pyrite crystals.
