In [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]], this would be called the ''[[arithmetic mean]]''.  In statistics, mean, [[median]], and [[Mode (statistics)|mode]] are all known as [[measurement|measure]]s of [[central tendency]]. \n\n==Calculation==\n\n===Arithmetic mean===\n{{Main|Arithmetic mean}}\nThe most common type of average is the arithmetic mean. If ''  n ''    numbers are given, each number denoted by ''a<sub>i</sub>'' (where ''i''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,2,&nbsp;\u2026,&nbsp;''n''), the arithmetic mean is the [[Summation|sum]] of the ''a''s divided by ''n'' or\n\n:<math>AM = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^na_i = \\frac{1}{n}\\left(a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n\\right)</math>\n\nThe arithmetic mean, often simply called the mean, of two numbers, such as 2 and 8, is obtained by finding a value A such that 2 + 8 = A + A. One may find that ''A'' =&nbsp;(2&nbsp;+&nbsp;8)/2 =&nbsp;5. Switching the order of 2 and 8 to read 8 and 2 does not change the resulting value obtained for A. The mean 5 is not less than the minimum 2 nor greater than the maximum&nbsp;8. If we increase the number of terms in the list to 2, 8, and 11, the arithmetic mean is found by solving for the value of ''A'' in the equation 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;8&nbsp;+&nbsp;11 =&nbsp;''A''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''A''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''A''. One finds that ''A'' =&nbsp;(2&nbsp;+&nbsp;8&nbsp;+&nbsp;11)/3 =&nbsp;7.\n\n===Pythagorean means===\n{{main|Pythagorean means}}\n{{see also|Mean#Pythagorean means}}\nAlong with the arithmetic mean above, the geometric mean and the harmonic mean are known collectively as the Pythagorean means.\n\n====Geometric mean====\nThe [[geometric mean]] of ''n'' positive numbers is obtained by multiplying them all together and then taking the ''n''th root.  In algebraic terms, the geometric mean of ''a''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''a''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;\u2026,&nbsp;''a''<sub>''n''</sub> is defined as\n\n: <math> GM= \\sqrt[n]{\\prod_{i=1}^n a_i} = \\sqrt[n]{a_1 a_2 \\cdots a_n}</math>\n\nGeometric mean can be thought of as the [[antilog]] of the arithmetic mean of the [[logarithm|logs]] of the numbers.\n\nExample: Geometric mean of 2 and 8 is <math>GM = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 8} = 4</math>\n\n====Harmonic mean====\n[[Harmonic mean]] for a non-empty collection of numbers ''a''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''a''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;\u2026,&nbsp;''a''<sub>''n''</sub>, all different from 0, is defined as the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>{{'}}s:\n\n: <math>HM = \\frac{1}{\\dfrac{1}{n}\\displaystyle\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{a_i}} = \\frac{n}{\\frac{1}{a_1} + \\frac{1}{a_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{a_n}}</math>\n\nOne example where the harmonic mean is useful is when examining the speed for a number of fixed-distance trips. For example, if the speed for going from point ''A'' to ''B'' was 60&nbsp;km/h, and the speed for returning from ''B'' to ''A'' was 40&nbsp;km/h, then the harmonic mean speed is given by\n\n: <math>\\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{60} + \\frac{1}{40}} = 48</math>\n\n====Inequality concerning AM, GM, and HM====\nA well known inequality concerning arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means for any set of positive numbers is\n\n: <math>AM \\ge GM \\ge HM</math>\n\nIt is easy to remember noting that the alphabetical order of the letters ''A'', ''G'', and ''H'' is preserved in the inequality. See [[Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means]].\n\nThus for the above harmonic mean example: AM = 50, GM \u2248 49, and HM = 48&nbsp;km/h.\n\n===Statistical location===\nThe [[mode (statistics)|mode]], the [[median]], and the [[mid-range]] are often used in addition to the [[mean]] as estimates of [[central tendency]] in [[descriptive statistics]].\n\n====Mode====\n[[Image:Comparison mean median mode.svg|thumb|300px|Comparison of [[mean|arithmetic mean]], [[median]] and [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of two [[log-normal distribution]]s with different [[skewness]].]]\n{{Main|Mode (statistics)}}\nThe most frequently occurring number in a list is called the mode. For example, the mode of the list (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4) is 3. It may happen that there are two or more numbers which occur equally often and more often than any other number. In this case there is no agreed definition of mode. Some authors say they are all modes and some say there is no mode.\n\n====Median====\n{{Main|Median}}\nThe median is the middle number of the group when they are ranked in order. (If there are an even number of numbers, the mean of the middle two is taken.)\n\nThus to find the median, order the list according to its elements' magnitude and then repeatedly remove the pair consisting of the highest and lowest values until either one or two values are left. If exactly one value is left, it is the median; if two values, the median is the arithmetic mean of these two. This method takes the list 1, 7, 3, 13 and orders it to read 1, 3, 7, 13. Then the 1 and 13 are removed to obtain the list 3, 7. Since there are two elements in this remaining list, the median is their arithmetic mean, (3 + 7)/2 = 5.\n\n==Summary of types==\n{{see also|Mean#Other means}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:white;\"\n|-\n!

The harmonic mean is an example of this using ''f''(''x'') = 1/''x'', and the geometric mean is another, using ''f''(''x'') = log&nbsp;''x''.\n\nHowever, this method for generating means is not general enough to capture all averages.  A more general method<ref name=Bibby/> for defining an average takes any function ''g''(''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''x''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;\u2026,&nbsp;''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) of a list of arguments that is [[Continuous function|continuous]], [[Monotonicity|strictly increasing]] in each argument, and symmetric (invariant under [[permutation]] of the arguments). The average ''y'' is then the value that, when replacing each member of the list, results in the same function value: {{nowrap|1=''g''(''y'', ''y'', \u2026, ''y'') =}} {{nowrap|''g''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}}.  This most general definition still captures the important property of all averages that the average of a list of identical elements is that element itself. The function {{nowrap|1=''g''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) =}} {{nowrap|''x''<sub>1</sub>+''x''<sub>2</sub>+ \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}} provides the arithmetic mean. The function {{nowrap|1 = ''g''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) =}} {{nowrap|''x''<sub>1</sub>''x''<sub>2</sub>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}} (where the list elements are positive numbers) provides the geometric mean. The function {{nowrap|1 = ''g''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) =}} {{nowrap|\u2212(''x''<sub>1</sub><sup>\u22121</sup>+''x''<sub>2</sub><sup>\u22121</sup>+ \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''x''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>\u22121</sup>)}} (where the list elements are positive numbers) provides the harmonic mean.<ref name=Bibby>{{cite journal | last1 = Bibby | first1 = John | year = 1974 | title = Axiomatisations of the average and a further generalisation of monotonic sequences | url = | journal = [[Glasgow Mathematical Journal]] | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 63\u201365 | doi=10.1017/s0017089500002135}}</ref>\n\n===Average percentage return and CAGR===\n{{Main|Compound annual growth rate}}\nA type of average used in finance is the average percentage return. It is an example of a geometric mean. When the returns are annual, it is called the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). For example, if we are considering a period of two years, and the investment return in the first year is \u221210% and the return in the second year is +60%, then the average percentage return or CAGR, ''R'', can be obtained by solving the equation: {{nowrap|1= (1 \u2212 10%) \u00d7 (1 + 60%) = (1 \u2212 0.1) \u00d7 (1 + 0.6) = (1 + ''R'') \u00d7 (1 + ''R'')}}. The value  of ''R'' that makes this equation true is 0.2, or 20%. This means that the total return over the 2-year period is the same as if there had been 20% growth each year. Note that the order of the years makes no difference \u2013 the average percentage returns of +60% and \u221210% is the same result as that for \u221210% and +60%.\n\nThis method can be generalized to examples in which the periods are not equal. For example, consider a period of a half of a year for which the return is \u221223% and a period of two and a half years for which the return is +13%. The average percentage return for the combined period is the single year return, ''R'', that is the solution of the following equation: {{nowrap|1= (1 \u2212 0.23)<sup>0.5</sup> \u00d7 (1 + 0.13)<sup>2.5</sup> = (1 + ''R'')<sup>0.5+2.5</sup>}}, giving an average percentage return ''R'' of 0.0600 or 6.00%.\n\n==Moving average==\n{{main|Moving average}}\n\nGiven a [[time series]] such as daily stock market prices or yearly temperatures people often want to create a smoother series.<ref>{{cite book | first1=George E.P. | last1= Box |first2=Gwilym M.| last2= Jenkins| title= Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control | edition= revised| publisher=Holden-Day | year=1976 | isbn=0816211043}}</ref> This helps to show underlying trends or perhaps periodic behavior. An easy way to do this is to choose a number ''n'' and create a new series by taking the arithmetic mean of the first ''n'' values, then moving forward one place and so on. This is the simplest form of moving average. More complicated forms involve using a [[weighted average]]. The weighting can be used to enhance or suppress various periodic behavior and there is very extensive analysis of what weightings to use in the  literature on [[Digital filter|filtering]]. In [[digital signal processing]] the term \u201cmoving average\u201d is used even when the sum of the weights is not 1.0 (so the output series is a scaled version of the averages).<ref>{{cite book | first1=Simon | last1= Haykin | title= Adaptive Filter Theory | publisher=Prentice-Hall | year=1986 | isbn=0130040525}}</ref> The reason for this is that the analyst is usually interested only in the trend or the periodic behavior. A further generalization is an [[Autoregressive moving average model|\u201cautoregressive moving average\u201d]]. In this case the average also includes some of the recently calculated outputs. This allows samples from further back in the history to affect the current output.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origin===\n\nThe first '''recorded''' time that the [[arithmetic mean]] was extended from 2 to n cases for the use of [[estimation]] was in the sixteenth century. From the late sixteenth century onwards, it gradually became a common method to use for reducing errors of measurement in various areas.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2333051 | volume=45 | title=Studies in the History of Probability and Statistics: VII. The Principle of the Arithmetic Mean | journal=Biometrika | pages=130}}</ref><ref name=\"york.ac.uk\">[http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/eisenhart.pdf Eisenhart, Churchill. \"The development of the concept of the best mean of a set of measurements from antiquity to the present day.\" Unpublished presidential address, American Statistical Association, 131st Annual Meeting, Fort Collins, Colorado. 1971.]</ref> At the time, astronomers wanted to know a real value from noisy measurement, such as the position of a planet or the diameter of the moon. Using the mean of several measured values, scientists assumed that the errors add up to a relatively small number when compared to the total of all measured values. The method of taking the mean for reducing observation errors was indeed mainly developed in astronomy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"amstatbakker\">[http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v11n1/bakker.html Bakker, Arthur. \"The early history of average values and implications for education.\" Journal of Statistics Education 11.1 (2003): 17-26.]</ref> A possible precursor to the arithmetic mean is the [[mid-range]] (the mean of the two extreme values), used for example in Arabian astronomy of the ninth to eleventh centuries, but also in metallurgy and navigation.<ref name=\"york.ac.uk\"/>\n\nHowever, there are various older vague references to the use of the arithmetic mean (which are not as clear, but might reasonably have to do with our modern definition of the mean). In a text from the 4th century, it was written that (text in square brackets is a possible missing text that might clarify the meaning):<ref>[https://arcaneknowledgeofthedeep.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/theologyarithmetic.pdf Waterfield, Robin. \"The theology of arithmetic.\" On the Mystical, mathematical and Cosmological Symbolism of the First Ten Number (1988). page 70.]</ref>\n: In the first place, we must set out in a row the sequence of numbers from the monad up to nine: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Then we must add up the amount of all of them together, and since the row contains nine terms, we must look for the ninth part of the total to see if it is already naturally present among the numbers in the row; and we will find that the property of being [one] ninth [of the sum] only belongs to the [arithmetic] mean itself...\n\nEven older potential references exist. There are records that from about 700 BC, merchants and shippers agreed that damage to the cargo and ship (their \"contribution\" in case of damage by the sea) should be shared equally among themselves.<ref name=\"amstatbakker\"/> This might have been calculated using the average, although there seem to be no direct record of the calculation.\n\n===Etymology===\nAccording to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', \"few words have received more etymological investigation.\"<ref>{{OED|average}}</ref>{{not in ref|date=May 2015}} In the 16th century ''average'' meant a customs duty, or the like, and was used in the Mediterranean area. It came to mean the cost of damage sustained at sea. From that came an \"average adjuster\" who decided how to apportion a loss between the owners and insurers of a ship and cargo.\n\nMarine damage is either ''particular average'', which is borne only by the owner of the damaged property, or [[general average]], where the owner can claim a proportional contribution from all the parties to the marine venture.  The type of calculations used in adjusting general average gave rise to the use of \"average\" to mean \"arithmetic mean\".\n\nA second English usage, documented as early as 1674 and sometimes spelled \"averish\", is as the residue and second growth of field crops, which were considered suited to consumption by [[draught animal]]s (\"avers\").<ref>{{cite book |last=Ray |first=John |authorlink=John Ray |title=A Collection of English Words Not Generally Used |year=1674 |publisher=H.

It is unclear in which language the word first appeared.\n\nThere is earlier (from at least the 11th century), unrelated use of the word. It appears to be an old legal term for a tenant's day labour obligation to a sheriff, probably anglicised from \"avera\" found in the English [[Domesday Book]] (1085).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Statistics}}\n*[[Average absolute deviation]]\n*[[Law of averages]]\n*[[Expected value]]\n*[[Central limit theorem]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070810034709/http://economicsbulletin.vanderbilt.edu/2004/volume3/EB-04C10011A.pdf Median as a weighted arithmetic mean of all Sample Observations]\n*[http://www.sengpielaudio.com/calculator-geommean.htm Calculations and comparison between arithmetic and geometric mean of two values]\n\n[[Category:Summary statistics]]\n[[Category:Means]]\n[[Category:Arithmetic functions]]"}]}}}}
