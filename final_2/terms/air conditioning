This process is used to achieve a more comfortable interior environment, typically for humans or animals; however, air conditioning is also used to cool/dehumidify rooms filled with heat-producing electronic devices, such as [[computer server]]s [[power amplifier]]s, and even to display and store artwork. Air conditioners often use a fan to distribute the conditioned air to an occupied space such as a building or a [[car]] to improve [[thermal comfort]] and [[indoor air quality]]. Electric refrigerant-based AC units range from small units that can cool a small bedroom, which can be carried by a single adult to massive units installed on the roof of office towers that can cool an entire building. The [[cooling]] is typically achieved through a [[refrigeration cycle]], but sometimes [[evaporative cooler|evaporation]] or [[free cooling]] is used. Air conditioning systems can also be made based on [[desiccant]]s. (chemicals which remove moisture from the air) and subterraneous pipes that can distribute the heated refrigerant to the ground for cooling.<ref>http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/E/AE_earth_cooling_tube.html</ref> \n\nIn the most general sense, air conditioning can refer to any form of technology that modifies the condition of air (heating, cooling, (de-)humidification, cleaning, ventilation, or air movement). In common usage, though, \"air conditioning\" refers to systems which cool air. In [[construction]], a complete system of heating, [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], and air conditioning is referred to as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning ([[HVAC]] \u2013 as opposed to ''AC'').<ref>{{cite book|last=McDowall |first=Robert |year=2006 |title=Fundamentals of HVAC Systems |publisher=Elsevier |page=3 |isbn=9780080552330 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Cite check|section|date=September 2010}}\n\n===Evaporative cooling===\nSince prehistoric times, snow and ice were used for cooling.

The evaporation of water cooled the air blowing through the window. This process also made the air more humid, which can be beneficial in a dry desert climate. In [[Ancient Rome]], water from [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s was circulated through the walls of certain houses to cool them. Other techniques in medieval [[Persia]] involved the use of [[cistern]]s and [[wind tower]]s to cool buildings during the hot season.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bahadori MN|title=Passive Cooling Systems in Iranian Architecture| journal=Scientific American| volume=238| issue=2| pages=144\u2013154| date=February 1978| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0278-144}}</ref>\n\nThe 2nd-century [[Ancient China|Chinese]] inventor [[Ding Huan]] ([[floruit|fl]] 180) of the [[Han Dynasty]] invented a [[Fan (mechanical)|rotary fan]] for air conditioning, with seven wheels {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} in diameter and manually powered by prisoners of the time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph|year=1991|title=Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 4: Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2, Mechanical Engineering| publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=99, 151, 233| isbn=978-0-521-05803-2}}</ref> In 747, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] (r. 712\u2013762) of the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) had the ''Cool Hall'' (''Liang Tian'') built in the imperial palace, which the ''Tang Yulin'' describes as having [[hydraulics|water-powered]] fan wheels for air conditioning as well as rising jet streams of water from fountains.

The introduction of residential air conditioning in the 1920s helped enable the great migration to the [[Sun Belt]] in the [[United States]].\n\nIn 1758, [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[John Hadley (chemist)|John Hadley]], a chemistry professor at [[Cambridge University]], conducted an experiment to explore the principle of evaporation as a means to rapidly cool an object. Franklin and Hadley confirmed that evaporation of highly volatile liquids (such as alcohol and ether) could be used to drive down the temperature of an object past the freezing point of water. They conducted their experiment with the bulb of a mercury thermometer as their object and with a bellows used to speed-up the evaporation. They lowered the temperature of the thermometer bulb down to {{convert|-14|C|0}} while the ambient temperature was {{convert|18|C|0}}. Franklin noted that, soon after they passed the freezing point of water {{convert|0|C|0}}, a thin film of ice formed on the surface of the thermometer's bulb and that the ice mass was about {{convert|1/4|in|mm|abbr=on|0|order=flip}} thick when they stopped the experiment upon reaching {{convert|-14|C|0}}. Franklin concluded: \"From this experiment one may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer's day\"<ref>{{cite web| last1=Franklin| first1=Benjamin| title=Letter to John Lining| url=http://www.waughfamily.ca/Montgomery/benfranklin1758.htm|accessdate=6 August 2014| date=June 17, 1758}}</ref>\n\nIn 1820, English scientist and inventor [[Michael Faraday]] discovered that compressing and liquefying [[ammonia]] could chill air when the liquefied ammonia was allowed to evaporate. In 1842, [[Florida]] physician [[John Gorrie]] used compressor technology to create ice, which he used to cool air for his patients in his hospital in [[Apalachicola, Florida|Apalachicola]], [[Florida]]. He hoped to eventually use his ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings. He even envisioned centralized air conditioning that could cool entire cities. Though his prototype leaked and performed irregularly, Gorrie was granted a patent in 1851 for his ice-making machine. Improved process for the artificial production of ice. His hopes for its success vanished soon afterwards when his chief financial backer died; Gorrie did not get the money he needed to develop the machine. According to his biographer, Vivian M. Sherlock, he blamed the \"Ice King\", [[Frederic Tudor]], for his failure, suspecting that Tudor had launched a [[smear campaign]] against his invention. Dr. Gorrie died impoverished in 1855, and the idea of air conditioning went away for 50 years.\n\n[[James Harrison (engineer)|James Harrison]]'s first mechanical ice-making machine began operation in 1851 on the banks of the Barwon River at Rocky Point in Geelong (Australia). His first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1853, and his patent for an ether [[vapor]] compression refrigeration system was granted in 1855. This novel system used a compressor to force the refrigeration gas to pass through a condenser, where it cooled down and liquefied. The liquefied gas then circulated through the refrigeration coils and vaporized again, cooling down the surrounding system. The machine employed a flywheel and produced 3,000 kilograms of ice per day.\n\nThough Harrison had commercial success establishing a second ice company back in Sydney in 1860, he later entered the debate over how to compete against the American advantage of unrefrigerated beef sales to the [[United Kingdom]]. He wrote: \"Fresh meat frozen and packed as if for a voyage, so that the refrigerating process may be continued for any required period\", and in 1873 prepared the sailing ship Norfolk for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom. His choice of a cold room system instead of installing a refrigeration system upon the ship itself proved disastrous when the ice was consumed faster than expected.\n\n=== Electromechanical cooling ===\n[[File:Willis Carrier 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Willis Carrier]]]]\nIn 1902, the first modern electrical air conditioning unit was [[invention|invented]] by [[Willis Carrier]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]. After graduating from [[Cornell University]], Carrier found a job at the [[Buffalo Forge Company]]. While there, he began experimenting with air conditioning as a way to solve an application problem for the Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing and Publishing Company in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. The first air conditioner, designed and built in Buffalo by Carrier, began working on 17 July 1902.\n\nDesigned to improve manufacturing process control in a [[printing]] plant, Carrier's invention controlled not only [[temperature]] but also [[humidity]]. Carrier used his knowledge of the heating of objects with steam and reversed the process. Instead of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thereby the amount of moisture in the air could be controlled, which in turn made the humidity in the room controllable. The controlled temperature and humidity helped maintain consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment. Later, Carrier's technology was applied to increase productivity in the workplace, and [[Carrier Corporation|The Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America]] was formed to meet rising demand. Over time, air conditioning came to be used to improve comfort in homes and [[automobile]]s as well. Residential sales expanded dramatically in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1906, [[Stuart W. Cramer]] of [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] was exploring ways to add moisture to the air in his textile mill. Cramer coined the term \"air conditioning\", using it in a patent claim he filed that year as an analogue to \"water conditioning\", then a well-known process for making textiles easier to process. He combined moisture with ventilation to \"condition\" and change the air in the factories, controlling the humidity so necessary in textile plants. Willis Carrier adopted the term and incorporated it into the name of his company.{{citation needed| date=July 2014}}\n\nShortly thereafter, the first private home to have air conditioning was built in Minneapolis in 1914, owned by [[Charles Gilbert Gates|Charles Gates]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to/a7951/a-brief-history-of-air-conditioning-10720229/ |title=A Brief History of Air Conditioning |publisher=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=2015-01-01}}</ref> Realizing that air conditioning would one day be a standard feature of private homes, particularly in regions with warmer climate, [[David St. Pierre DuBose]] (1898-1994) designed a network of ductwork and vents for his home ''Meadowmont'', all disguised behind intricate and attractive Georgian-style open moldings.{{when|date=September 2015}} This building is believed to be one of the first private homes in the United States equipped for [[central air conditioning]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rizzoconferencecenter.com/PDFs/History-of-Meadowmont.pdf |title=Early University Benefactors |publisher=Rizzoconferencecenter.com |accessdate=2012-11-08}}</ref>\n\nIn 1945, [[Robert Sherman (engineer)|Robert Sherman]] of [[Lynn, Massachusetts]] invented a portable, in-window air conditioner that cooled, heated, humidified, dehumidified, and filtered the air.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://navlog.org/patent_1.html |title=Unsung Engineering Heros: Robert Sherman |publisher=Navlog.org|accessdate=2015-06-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Refrigerant development ===\n{{Main article|Refrigerant}}\n[[File:Embraco compressor.jpg|thumb|A modern [[R-134a]] hermetic refrigeration [[gas compressor|compressor]]]]\nThe first air conditioners and [[refrigerator]]s employed toxic or flammable gases, such as [[ammonia]], [[methyl chloride]], or [[propane]], that could result in fatal accidents when they leaked. [[Thomas Midgley, Jr.]] created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, ''[[Freon]]'', in 1928. The name is a [[trademark]] name owned by [[DuPont]] for any [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC), [[HCFC|hydrochlorofluorocarbon]] (HCFC), or [[hydrofluorocarbon]] (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as [[chlorodifluoromethane]] (R-22).\n\n[[Dichlorodifluoromethane]] (R-12) was the most common blend used in automobiles in the US until 1994, when most designs changed to [[1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane|R-134A]] due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the US for this type of application, so the only source for air-conditioning repair purposes is the cleaned and purified gas recovered from other air conditioner systems. Several non-ozone-depleting refrigerants have been developed as alternatives, including [[R-410A]]. It was first commercially used by Carrier Corp. under the brand name ''Puron''.\n\nModern refrigerants have been developed to be more environmentally safe than many of the early chlorofluorocarbon-based refrigerants used in the early- and mid-twentieth century. These include [[HCFC]]s ([[Chlorodifluoromethane|R-22]], as used in most U.S. homes even before 2011) and [[hydrofluorocarbon|HFC]]s ([[R-134a]], used in most cars) have replaced most CFC use. HCFCs, in turn, are supposed to have been in the process of being phased out under the [[Montreal Protocol]] and replaced by HFCs such as [[R-410A]], which lack chlorine.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} HFCs, however, contribute to climate change problems.  Moreover, policy and political influence by corporate executives resisted change.<ref>Mate, John \"Making a Difference: A Case Study of the Greenpeace Ozone Campaign\" RECIEL 10:2 2001.</ref><ref>Benedick, Richard Elliot Ozone Diplomacy Cambridge, MA: Harvard University 1991.</ref> Corporations insisted that no alternatives to HFCs existed.

Notice [[frost]] formation]]\n\nIn the refrigeration cycle, heat is transported from a colder location to a hotter area. As heat would naturally flow in the opposite direction, work is required to achieve this. A [[refrigerator]] is an example of such a system, as it transports the heat out of the interior and into its environment. The [[refrigerant]] is used as the medium which absorbs and removes heat from the space to be cooled and subsequently rejects that heat elsewhere.\n\nCirculating refrigerant vapor enters the [[gas compressor|compressor]], where its pressure and temperature are [[Gas compressor#Temperature|increased]]. The hot, compressed refrigerant vapor is now at a temperature and pressure at which it can be [[Condensation|condensed]] and is routed through a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]]. Here it is cooled by air flowing across the condenser coils and condensed into a liquid. Thus, the circulating refrigerant removes heat from the system and the heat is carried away by the air.  The removal of this heat can be greatly augmented by pouring water over the condenser coils, making it much cooler when it hits the expansion valve.\n\nThe condensed, pressurized, and still usually somewhat hot liquid refrigerant is next routed through an [[Thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]] (often nothing more than a pinhole in the system's copper tubing) where it undergoes an abrupt reduction in pressure. That pressure reduction results in [[flash evaporation]] of a part of the liquid refrigerant, greatly lowering its temperature. The cold refrigerant is then routed through the [[evaporator coil|evaporator]]. A fan blows the interior warm air (which is to be cooled) across the evaporator, causing the liquid part of the cold refrigerant mixture to evaporate as well, further lowering the temperature. The warm air is therefore cooled and is pumped by an exhaust fan/ blower into the room.\n\nTo complete the refrigeration cycle, the refrigerant vapor is routed back into the compressor.  In order for the process to have any efficiency, the cooling/ evaporative portion of the system must be separated by some kind of physical barrier from the heating/ condensing portion, and each portion must have its own fan to circulate its own \"kind\" of air (either the hot air or the cool air).  Modern air conditioning systems are not designed to draw air into the room from the outside, they only recirculate the increasingly cool air on the inside.  Because this inside air always has some amount of moisture suspended in it, the cooling portion of the process always causes ambient warm water vapor to condense on the cooling coils and to drip from them down onto a catch tray at the bottom of the unit from which it must then be routed outside, usually through a drain hole.\n\nAs this moisture has no dissolved minerals in it, it never causes mineral buildup on the coils, though if the unit is set at its strongest cooling setting and happens to have inadequate circulation of air through the coils and also experiences a failure of the thermistor which senses the ambient temperature in the room, the coil's fins can develop a layer of ice which will then grow and eventually block the circulation of air on the cool side of the unit altogether in a positive feedback loop that will cause the formation of an ice block inside the unit: only minuscule amounts of cool air will then manage to come from the exhaust vent until this ice is removed or is allowed to melt.  This will happen even if the ambient humidity level is low: once ice begins to form on the evaporative fins, it will reduce circulation efficiency and cause the development of more ice, etc.  A clean and strong circulatory fan can help prevent this, as will raising the target cool temperature of the unit's thermostat to a point that the compressor is allowed to turn off occasionally. A failing thermistor may also cause this problem.  This is the same issue faced by refrigerators that do not have a [[defrost]] cycle.  Dust can also cause the fins to begin blocking air flow with the same undesirable result: ice.\n\nBy running an air conditioner's compressor in the opposite direction, the overall effect can be completely reversed and the indoor compartment will become heated instead of cooled. See [[heat pump]]. The engineering of physical and thermodynamic properties of gas\u2013vapor mixtures is called [[psychrometrics]].\n\n==== Heat pump unit ====\n{{Main article|Heat pump}}\n[[File:External heat pump.jpg|thumb|upright|An example of an externally fitted AC unit which uses a heat pump system.]]\nA heat pump is an air conditioner in which the [[refrigeration cycle]] can be reversed, producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as a \"reverse cycle air conditioner\". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than [[electric resistance heating]]. Some homeowners elect to have a heat pump system installed as a feature of a [[central air conditioner]]. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).\n\nAir-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 40\u201355&nbsp;\u00b0F (4\u201313&nbsp;\u00b0C), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil ''back'' to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. A heat pump system will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter. The icing problem becomes much more severe with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as a [[natural gas]] or [[heating oil|oil]] [[furnace]], which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.\n\n[[Absorption refrigerator|Absorption heat pumps]] are a kind of air-source heat pump, but they do not depend on electricity to power them. Instead, gas, solar power, or heated water is used as a main power source. An absorption pump dissolves ammonia gas in water, which gives off heat. Next, the water and ammonia mixture is depressurized to induce boiling, and the ammonia is boiled off, which absorbs heat from the outdoor air.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nSome more expensive window air conditioning units have a true heat pump function. However, a window unit may only have an electric resistance heater.\n\n=== Evaporative cooling ===\n{{Main article|Evaporative cooler}}\n[[File:Evaporative cooler, CO, IMG 5681.JPG|thumb|An evaporative cooler]]\nIn very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporative cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large [[sponge (tool)|sponge]] soaked with water. The [[sensible heat]] of the incoming air, as measured by a [[Dry-bulb temperature|dry bulb thermometer]], is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the [[total heat]] (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.\n\nEvaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioners, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window.<ref>{{cite book |title = Greenhouse gardener's companion: growing food and flowers in your greenhouse or sunspace| edition = 2nd| author = Shane Smith| publisher = Fulcrum Publishing| year = 2000| isbn = 978-1-55591-450-9| page = 62| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Onv60-c6iEIC&pg=PA62&dq=evaporative-cooler+exhaust+open+door+window&q=evaporative-cooler%20exhaust%20open%20door%20window }}</ref> These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain.\n\n=== Free cooling ===\n{{Main article|Free cooling}}\nAir conditioning can also be provided by a process called [[free cooling]] which uses pumps to circulate a coolant (typically water or a glycol mix) from a cold source, which in turn acts as a [[heat sink]] for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes, equipped with heat exchanger. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.\n\nFree cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES) so the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Free cooling and hybrid systems are [[mature technology]].<ref>Snijders A. 2008. [http://trca.on.ca/dotAsset/16551.pdf ATES Technology Development and Major Applications in Europe]. Conservation for the Living Community Workshop (Toronto and Region Conservation Authority).</ref>\n\n== Humidity control ==\nSince humans perspire to provide natural cooling by the [[evaporation]] of [[perspiration]] from the skin, drier air (up to a point) improves the comfort provided. The comfort air conditioner is designed to create a 50% to 60% relative humidity in the occupied space.\n\n=== Dehumidification and cooling ===\nRefrigeration air conditioning equipment usually reduces the absolute [[humidity]] of the air processed by the system. The relatively cold (below the [[dewpoint]]) evaporator coil condenses water vapor from the processed air, much like an ice-cold drink will condense water on the outside of a glass. Therefore, water vapor is removed from the cooled air and the relative humidity in the room is lowered. The water is usually sent to a drain or may simply drip onto the ground outdoors.\nThe heat is rejected by the condenser which is located outside of room to be cooled.\n\n=== Dehumidification only ===\n{{main article|Dehumidifier}}\n[[Image:Maytag dehumidifier1.jpg|thumb|upright|Typical portable dehumidifier]]\nA specialized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a [[dehumidifier]]. It also uses a [[refrigeration cycle]], but differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the ''same'' room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric [[Watt|power]] consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually ''heated'', just as by an [[electric heater]] that draws the same amount of power.\n\nIn addition, if water is condensed in the room, the amount of heat previously needed to evaporate that water also is re-released in the room (the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]]). The dehumidification process is the inverse of adding water to the room with an [[evaporative cooler]], and instead releases heat. Therefore, an in-room dehumidifier always will warm the room and reduce the relative humidity indirectly, as well as reducing the humidity directly by condensing and removing water.\n\nInside the unit, the air passes over the evaporator coil first, and is cooled and dehumidified. The now dehumidified, cold air then passes over the condenser coil where it is warmed up again. Then the air is released back into the room. The unit produces warm, dehumidified air and can usually be placed freely in the environment (room) that is to be conditioned.\n\nDehumidifiers are commonly used in cold, damp climates to prevent [[mold]] growth indoors, especially in basements. They are also used to protect sensitive equipment from the adverse effects of excessive humidity in [[tropical countries]].\n\n== Energy transfer ==\nIn a thermodynamically [[closed system]], any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jan F. Kreider|title= Handbook of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning|publisher=CRC press|isbn=0-8493-9584-4}}</ref> In order to do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its \"efficiency\" ([[coefficient of performance]]) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100&nbsp;W [[heating element]] is activated, and the air conditioner has an coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50&nbsp;W to compensate for this, thus making the 100&nbsp;W heating element cost a total of 150&nbsp;W of power.\n\nIt is typical for air conditioners to operate at \"efficiencies\" of significantly greater than 100%.<ref>{{cite book|author=Winnick, J|title=Chemical engineering thermodynamics|year=1996| publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=0-471-05590-5}}</ref> However, it may be noted that the input electrical energy is of higher thermodynamic quality (lower [[entropy]]) than the output thermal energy (heat energy).\n\nAir conditioner equipment power in the U.S. is often described in terms of \"tons of refrigeration\". A [[ton of refrigeration]] is approximately equal to the cooling power of one [[short ton]] (2000 pounds or 907 kilograms) of ice melting in a 24-hour period. The value is defined as 12,000 [[BTU]] per hour, or 3517 watts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB9.html|title=NIST Guide to the SI|accessdate=2007-05-18|publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070528005956/http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB9.html| archivedate= 28 May 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Residential central air systems are usually from 1 to 5 tons (3 to 20 kilowatts (kW)) in capacity.\n\n=== Seasonal energy efficiency ratio ===\n{{Main article|Seasonal energy efficiency ratio}}\nFor residential homes, some countries set minimum requirements for energy efficiency. In the United States, the efficiency of air conditioners is often (but not always) rated by the ''seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER)''. The higher the SEER rating, the more energy efficient is the air conditioner. The SEER rating is the BTU of cooling output during its normal annual usage divided by the total electric energy input in [[Kilowatt hour|watt hour]]s (W\u00b7h) during the same period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.cfm?id=S|title=Energy Glossary&nbsp;\u2013 S|accessdate=2006-07-02|work=Energy Glossary|publisher=[[Energy Information Administration]]}}</ref>\n\n: '''SEER = BTU \u00f7 (W\u00b7h) '''\nthis can also be rewritten as:\n: '''SEER = (BTU / h) \u00f7 W''', where \"W\" is the average electrical power in Watts, and (BTU/h) is the rated cooling power.\n\nFor example, a 5000 BTU/h air-conditioning unit, with a SEER of 10, would consume 5000/10 = 500 Watts of power on average.\n\nThe electrical energy consumed per year can be calculated as the average power multiplied by the annual operating time:\n\n: '''500 W \u00d7 1000 h = 500,000 W\u00b7h = 500 [[kWh]]'''\n\nAssuming 1000 hours of operation during a typical cooling season (i.e., 8 hours per day for 125 days per year).\n\nAnother method that yields the same result, is to calculate the total annual cooling output:\n\n: '''5000 BTU/h \u00d7 1000 h = 5,000,000 BTU'''\n\nThen, for a SEER of 10, the annual electrical energy usage would be:\n\n: '''5,000,000 BTU \u00f7 10 = 500,000 W\u00b7h = 500 kWh'''\n\nSEER is related to the [[coefficient of performance]] (COP) commonly used in [[thermodynamics]] and also to the [[Energy Efficiency Ratio]] (EER). The EER is the efficiency rating for the equipment at a particular pair of external and internal temperatures, while SEER is calculated over a whole range of external temperatures (i.e., the temperature distribution for the geographical location of the SEER test). SEER is unusual in that it is composed of an [[Imperial units|Imperial unit]] divided by an [[SI unit]]. The COP is a ratio with the same metric units of energy ([[joule]]s) in both the [[Fraction (mathematics)|numerator]] and [[Fraction (mathematics)|denominator]]. They cancel out, leaving a [[dimensionless quantity]]. Formulas for the approximate conversion between SEER and EER or COP are available from the [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]]:<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071202130510/http://www.pge.com/docs/pdfs/biz/rebates/spc_contracts/2004_manuals_forms/spc_cooling_units.pdf SEER conversion formulas from Pacific Gas and Electric].

The interior air is cooled as a fan blows it over the evaporator. On the exterior the heat drawn from the interior is dissipated into the environment as a second fan blows outside air over the condenser. A large house or building may have several such units, allowing each room to be cooled separately.\n\n[[Packaged terminal air conditioner|Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC)]] systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump. While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.\n\nThe first practical through-the-wall air conditioning unit was invented by engineers at [[Chrysler Motors]] and offered for sale starting in 1935.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines |title=Popular Mechanics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uN4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA885 |accessdate=9 January 2012 |date=June 1935 |publisher=Hearst Magazines |pages=885\u2013 |issn=0032-4558}}</ref>\n\n=== Split systems ===\nSplit-system air conditioners come in two forms: mini-split and central systems. In both types, the inside-environment (evaporative) [[heat exchanger]] is separated by some distance from the outside-environment (condensing unit) heat exchanger.\n\n==== Mini-split (ductless) system ====\n::Main article: [[Split-system air conditioner]]\n[[File:Splitklimaanlage IMGP9925 unbranded.jpg|thumb|Outside part of a ductless split-type air conditioner]]<!---->[[File:GALANZ II.jpg|thumb|right|Indoor part of a ductless split-type air conditioner]]\nA mini-split system typically supplies air conditioned and heated air to a single or a few rooms of a building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mitsubishipro.com/media/382145/m-series_revised_july13.pdf|format=PDF|title=Mitsubishi Contractors Guide|page=16|publisher=Mitsubishipro.com|accessdate=2015-06-10}}</ref> Mutli-zone systems are a common application of ductless systems and allow up to 8 rooms (zones) to be conditioned from a single outdoor unit. Multi-zone systems typically offer a variety of indoor unit styles including wall-mounted, ceiling-mounted, ceiling recessed, and horizontal ducted. Mini-split systems typically produce {{convert|9000|to(-)|36000|Btu|abbr=on}} per hour of cooling. Multi-zone systems provide extended cooling and heating capacity up to 60,000 Btu's.\n\nAdvantages of the ductless system include smaller size and flexibility for zoning or heating and cooling individual rooms. The inside wall space required is significantly reduced. Also, the compressor and heat exchanger can be located farther away from the inside space, rather than merely on the other side of the same unit as in a PTAC or window air conditioner. Flexible exterior hoses lead from the outside unit to the interior one(s); these are often enclosed with metal to look like common drainpipes from the roof. In addition, ductless systems offer higher efficiency, reaching above 30 SEER.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mitsubishipro.com/en/professional/products/heat-pump-systems/m--p-single-zone/m-series-heat-pump-systems/msz-fhmuz-fh |title=Mitsubishi Electric US, Inc.

Such systems cost about US$1,500 to US$2,000 per ton (12,000 BTU per hour) of cooling capacity. This is about 30% more than central systems (not including ductwork) and may cost more than twice as much as window units of similar capacity.\"<ref name=doe20120809>\n{{cite web |title=Ductless Mini-Split Air Conditioners |url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/ductless-mini-split-air-conditioners |publisher=US Department of Energy |date=2012-08-09 |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref>\n\nAn additional possible disadvantage that the cost of installing mini splits can be higher than some systems, although lower operating costs and [[rebate (marketing)|rebates]] or other financial incentives\u2014offered in some areas\u2014can help offset the initial expense.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ductless, mini-Split Heat Pumps| url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/ductless-mini-split-heat-pumps | publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref>\n\n====Central (ducted) air conditioning====\nCentral ([[Duct (HVAC)|ducted]]) air conditioning offers whole-house or large-commercial-space cooling, and often offers moderate multi-zone temperature control capability by the addition of air-louver-control boxes.\n\nIn central air conditioning, the inside heat-exchanger is typically placed inside the central furnace/AC unit of the [[Forced-air|forced air]] [[central heating|heating system]] which is then used in the summer to distribute chilled air throughout a residence or commercial building.\n\n=== Portable units ===\nA portable air conditioner can be easily transported inside a home or office. They are currently available with capacities of about {{convert|5000|-|60000|btu/h|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} and with or without electric-resistance heaters. Portable air conditioners are either evaporative or refrigerative.\n\nThe compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a car radiator or typical household air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.\n\n==== Portable split system ====\nA portable  system has an indoor unit on wheels connected to an outdoor unit via flexible pipes, similar to a permanently fixed installed unit.\n\n==== Portable hose system ====\nHose systems, which can be ''monoblock'' or ''air-to-air'', are vented to the outside via air [[Duct (HVAC)|ducts]]. The ''monoblock'' type collects the water in a bucket or tray and stops when full. The ''air-to-air'' type re-evaporates the water and discharges it through the ducted hose and can run continuously.\n\nA single-hose unit uses air from within the room to cool its condenser, and then vents it outside. This air is replaced by hot air from outside or other rooms (due to the negative pressure inside the room), thus reducing the unit's overall efficiency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.experts123.com/q/what-is-the-difference-between-a-single-hose-design-and-a-dual-hose-design.html |title=In the two hose design the exchanged air does not come from the interior of the room or house, but enters through the second hose. |publisher=Experts123.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-10}}</ref>\n\nModern units might have a [[coefficient of performance]] of approximately 3 (i.e., 1&nbsp;kW of electricity will produce 3&nbsp;kW of cooling). A dual-hose unit draws air to cool its condenser from outside instead of from inside the room, and thus is more effective than most single-hose units. These units create no negative pressure in the room.\n\n==== Portable evaporative system ====\n[[Evaporative cooler]]s, sometimes called \"swamp coolers\", do not have a compressor or condenser. Liquid water is evaporated on the cooling fins, releasing the vapor into the cooled area. Evaporating water absorbs a significant amount of heat, the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporisation]], cooling the air. Humans and animals use the same mechanism to cool themselves by [[Perspiration|sweating]].\n\nEvaporative coolers have the advantage of needing no hoses to vent heat outside the cooled area, making them truly portable. They are also very cheap to install and use less energy than refrigerative air conditioners.\n\n== Uses ==\nAir-conditioning engineers broadly divide air conditioning applications into ''comfort'' and ''process'' applications.\n\n=== Comfort applications ===\n[[File:ACFujitsu2.jpg|thumb|An array of air conditioners outside a commercial office building.]]\nComfort applications aim to provide a [[Building science|building indoor environment]] that remains relatively constant despite changes in external weather conditions or in internal heat loads.\n\nAir conditioning makes [[deep plan]] buildings feasible, for otherwise they would have to be built narrower or with [[light well]]s so that inner spaces received sufficient outdoor air via [[natural ventilation]]. Air conditioning also allows buildings to be taller, since [[Wind gradient|wind speed]] increases significantly with altitude making natural ventilation impractical for very tall buildings.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Comfort applications are quite different for various building types and may be categorized as:\n* Commercial buildings, which are built for commerce, including offices, malls, shopping centers, restaurants, etc.\n* High-rise residential buildings, such as tall dormitories and apartment blocks\n* Industrial spaces where thermal comfort of workers is desired\n* Institutional buildings, which includes government buildings, hospitals, schools, etc.\n* Low-rise residential buildings, including single-family houses, duplexes, and small apartment buildings\n* Sports stadiums, such as the [[University of Phoenix Stadium]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/12/03/qatar.world.cup/ | work=CNN | title=Qatar promises air-conditioned World Cup | date=2010-12-03}}</ref> and in [[Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Qatar for the 2022 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/news/2010/12/101203_qatar_wt_sl.shtml |title=BBC World Service - News - Qatar 2022: How to build comfortable stadiums in a hot climate |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2010-12-03 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}</ref>\n\nWomen have, on average, a significantly lower resting [[metabolic rate]] than men.<ref name=Nature2015>{{Cite journal\n  |title=Energy consumption in buildings and female thermal demand\n  |date=3 August 2015\n  |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature Climate Change]]\n  |first=Boris  |last=Kingma\n  |first2=Wouter  |last2=van Marken Lichtenbelt\n  |doi=10.1038/NCLIMATE2741\n  |url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2741.epdf?referrer_access_token=wiK8dZ7RjiyB3YY0wnE8KtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OxYB2QX8K1vS0r2SpOOxl5-QKWpBFSROwh6pmh1aKkmK1QsLkiUh-x9WiiZOVT_KZEM-75l-GmRqWTuSWcVzsluWpVahvIbv3gTKpiFDHPmMex7qU08kj3MLBk6q_QlXQ%3D&tracking_referrer=www.bbc.co.uk\n}}</ref> Using inaccurate metabolic rate guidelines for air conditioning sizing can result in oversized and less efficient equipment,<ref name=Nature2015 /> and setting system operating setpoints too cold can result in reduced worker productivity.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lang|first1=Susan|title=Study links warm offices to fewer typing errors and higher productivity|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2004/10/warm-offices-linked-fewer-typing-errors-higher-productivity|accessdate=25 September 2015|publisher=Cornell Chronicle|date=October 19, 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to buildings, air conditioning can be used for many types of transportation, including automobiles, buses and other land vehicles, trains, ships, aircraft, and spacecraft.\n\n==== Domestic usage ====\n[[File:AirConditioner.jpg|thumb|Typical residential central air conditioner in North America]]\nAir conditioning is common in the US, with 88% of new [[single-family homes]] constructed in 2011 including air conditioning, ranging from 99% in the [[Southern United States|South]] to 62% in the [[Western United States|West]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/construction/chars/highlights.html| title=Characteristics of New Housing|authors=US Census Bureau (MCD): Cheryl Cornish, Stephen Cooper, Salima Jenkins| work=census.gov}}</ref> In [[Canada]], air conditioning use varies by province.

Old R-12 systems can be retrofitted to R-134a by a complete flush and filter/dryer replacement to remove the mineral oil, which is not compatible with R-134a.\n\n[[Chlorodifluoromethane|R22]] (also known as HCFC-22) has a [[global warming potential]] about 1,800 times higher than [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter2.pdf |title=Chapter.2_FINAL.indd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-09}}</ref> It was phased out for use in new equipment by 2010, and is to be completely discontinued by 2020. Although these gasses can be recycled when air conditioning units are disposed of, uncontrolled dumping and leaking can release gas directly into the atmosphere.\n\nIn the UK, the Ozone Regulations<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/protecting-and-enhancing-our-urban-and-natural-environment-to-improve-public-health-and-wellbeing/supporting-pages/controlling-ozone-depleting-substances-and-fluorinated-greenhouse-gases |title=2010 to 2015 government policy: environmental quality |publisher=GOV.UK |date=2015-05-08 |accessdate=2015-06-10}}</ref> came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a \"top-up\" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.thermotechsolutions.co.uk/air-conditioning/r22-facts/| title=R22 - The Facts| work=Thermotech - Fire Protection and Air Conditioning}}</ref>\n\nThe manufacture and use of CFCs has been banned or severely restricted due to concerns about ozone depletion (see also [[Montreal Protocol]]).<ref name=\"sciencedaily\">[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/07/030730080139.htm Sciencedaily.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406223118/http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/07/030730080139.htm |date=April 6, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Schlossberg |first=Tatiana |authorlink=Tatiana Schlossberg |date=August 9, 2016 |title=How Bad Is Your Air-Conditioner for the Planet? |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/science/air-conditioner-global-warming.html |newspaper=NYT |location= |access-date=August 17, 2016}}</ref>  In light of these environmental concerns, beginning on November 14, 1994, the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S.]] Environmental Protection Agency has restricted the sale, possession and use of refrigerant to only licensed technicians, per rules under sections 608 and 609 of the Clean Air Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ozone/title6/608/608fact.html |title=Complying With The Section 608 Refrigerant Recycling Rule &#124; Ozone Layer Protection - Regulatory Programs &#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-06-10}}</ref>\n\nAs an alternative to conventional refrigerants, other gases, such as CO<sub>2</sub> ([[R-744]]), have been proposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.r744.com/knowledge/papers_result_free.php?page_no=0&txt_key_free=air%20conditioning&sortby=year%20DESC |title=The current status in Air Conditioning&nbsp;\u2013 papers & presentations |publisher=R744.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-09}}</ref> R-744 is being adopted as a refrigerant in Europe and Japan.
