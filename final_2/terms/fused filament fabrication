This is fed from a large coil, through a moving, heated '''printer extruder head'''. Molten material is forced out of the print head's nozzle and is deposited on the growing workpiece. The head is moved, under computer control, to define the printed shape. Usually the head moves in layers, moving in two dimensions to deposit one horizontal plane at a time, before moving slightly upwards to begin a new slice. The speed of the extruder head may also be controlled, to stop and start deposition and form an interrupted plane without stringing or dribbling between sections.\n\nFused filament printing is now the most popular process (by number of machines) for hobbyist-grade 3D printing. As other techniques, such a photpolymerisation and powder sintering, may offer better results at greater cost, they still dominate commercial printing.\n\n[[File:Extruder lemio.svg|thumb|Illustration of an extruder, that shows how all parts are named.]]\nThe '''3D printer head''' or '''3D printer extruder''' is a part in material extrusion-type printing responsible for raw material melting and forming it into a continuous profile. A wide variety of materials are extruded, including thermoplastics such as ''acrylonitrile butadiene styrene'' (ABS), ''polylactic acid'' (PLA), ''high-impact polystyrene'' (HIPS), ''thermoplastic polyurethane'' (TPU), ''aliphatic polyamides'' (nylon),<ref name=\"RepRap Wiki Category:Thermoplastics\">{{cite web | url=http://reprap.org/wiki/Category:Thermoplastic | title=RepRap Wiki Category:Thermoplastics | accessdate=2 November 2014}}</ref> and recently also [[PEEK]]. <ref name=\"3D-printing PEEK\">{{cite web|title=3dprint.com, PEEK being 3D-printed|url=http://3dprint.com/52713/indmatec-peek-fdm-printing-filament|work=3dprint.com|date=March 21, 2015|accessdate=March 26, 2015}}</ref> Paste-like materials such as ceramics and chocolate can be extruded using the fused filament process and a paste extruder.<ref name=\"Universal Paste extruder \u2013 Ceramic, Food and Real Chocolate 3D Printing by RichRap\">{{cite web | url=http://richrap.blogspot.com/2012/04/universal-paste-extruder-ceramic-food.html | title=Universal Paste extruder \u2013 Ceramic, Food and Real Chocolate 3D Printing | accessdate=2 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Introduction==\n[[Additive manufacturing]] (AM), also referred to as 3D printing, involves manufacturing a part by depositing material layer by-layer. There is a wide array of different AM technologies that can make a part layer-by-layer including material extrusion, binder jetting, material jetting and directed energy deposition.<ref name=\"3-D Printing\">{{cite journal | url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.addma.2014.08.005 | title=Making sense of 3-D printing: Creating a map of additive manufacturing products and services | author=Brett P.

The '''3D Printer Liquefier '''is the component predominantly used in Material extrusion type printing.\n\n===Extrusion===\n[[File:3D Printer Extruder.png|thumb|right|400px]]\n[[Extrusion]] in 3-D printing using material extrusion involves a cold end and a hot end.\n\nThe '''cold end''' is part of an extruder system that pulls and feed the material from the [[Bobbin|spool]], and pushes it towards the hot end. The cold end is mostly gear- or roller-based supplying torque to the material and controlling the feed rate by means of a [[stepper motor]].  By this means the process rate is controlled.\n\nThe '''hot end''' is the active part which also hosts the liquefier of the 3D printer that melts the filament. It allows the [[molten plastic]] to exit from the small [[nozzle]] to form a thin and tacky bead of plastic that will adhere to the material it is laid on. the hot end consists of a heating chamber and a nozzle. The hole in the tip (nozzle) has a diameter of between 0.3&nbsp;mm and 1.0&nbsp;mm. Different types of nozzles and heating methods are used depending upon the material to be printed.<ref name=\"Reprap extruders\">{{cite web | url=http://reprap.org/wiki/Category:Extruders | title=FDM Extruders | accessdate=24 October 2014}}Reprap extruders</ref>\n\nSome type of 3-D printing machines can have a different type of extrusion system which may not have a heating chamber- the heat is supplied from another source, e.g. a [[laser]].\n\n=== Extruder mount to rest of machine ===\n\nThe ways extruders are mounted on the rest of the machine have evolved over time into informal mounting standards. These informal standards include:<ref name=\"Reprap extruders\"></ref>\n*the [[Vertical X Axis Standard]],\n*the [http://richrap.blogspot.com/2012/03/mendelmax-quick-fit-x-and-quick-fit.html Quick-fit extruder mount],\n*the [[OpenX (mount)|OpenX]] mount,\netc.\n\nSuch de-facto standards allows new extruder designs to be tested on existing printer frames, and new printer frame designs to use existing extruders.\n\n==Process==\n[[File:FDM by Zureks.png|thumb|right|400px|Process: 1 \u2013 3D Printer Extruder, 2 \u2013 deposited material (modeled part), 3 \u2013 controlled movable table]]\nFlow geometry of the extruder, heating method and the melt flow behavior of a non-Newtonian fluid are of main consideration in the part.\n\nA plastic filament is supplied from a reel, either commercially available or home made, and fed into a heated liquefier where it is melted. This melt is then extruded by a nozzle while the incoming filament, still in solid phase, acts as a \u2018\u2018'''plunger'''.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe nozzle is mounted to a mechanical stage, which can be moved in the '''xy''' plane. As the nozzle is moved over the table in a prescribed geometry, it deposits a thin bead of extruded plastic, called a \u2018\u2018'''road'''\u2019\u2019 which solidifies quickly upon contact with substrate and/or roads deposited earlier.<ref name=\"Liquefier\">{{cite journal | url=http://manufacturingscience.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/ | title=Liquefier Dynamics in Fused Deposition | author=Selc\u00b8uk Gu\u00a8c\u00b8eri, Maurizio Bertoldi | journal=Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering | volume=126 | issue=2 | pages=237 | year=2014 | doi=10.1115/1.1688377| last2=G\u00fc\u00e7Eri | last3=Bertoldi }}Liquefier Dynamics in Fused Deposition</ref>\n\nSolid layers are generated by following a rasterizing motion where the roads are deposited side by side within an enveloping domain boundary.\n\nOnce a layer is completed, the platform is lowered in the '''z direction''' in order to start the next layer. This process continues until the fabrication of the object is completed.\n\nFor Successful bonding of the roads in the process control of the thermal environment is necessary. Therefore, the system is kept inside a chamber, maintained at a temperature just below the melting point of the material being deposited.\n\n==Physics==\n[[File:3D Extruder Driving Force.png|thumb |right|400px|3D Printer Extruder Driving Force. Where D_f is Diameter of Filament and L_f is Length of filament]]\nDuring extrusion the thermoplastic filament is introduced by mechanical pressure from Rollers, into the liquefier, where it melts and is then extruded. The rollers are the only drive mechanism in the material delivery system, therefore filament is under tensile stress upstream to the roller and under compression at the downstream side acting as a plunger. Therefore compressive stress is the driving force behind the extrusion process.\n\nThe force required to extrude the melt must be sufficient to overcome the pressure drop across the system, which strictly depends on the viscous properties of the melted material and the flow geometry of the liquefier and nozzle. The melted material is subjected to shear deformation during the flow. [[Shear thinning]] behavior is observed in most of the materials used in this type of 3-D printing. This is modeled using power law for generalized Newtonian fluids.\n\nThe temperature is regulated by heat input from electrical coil heaters. The system continuously adjusts the power supplied to the coils according to the temperature difference between the desired value and the value detected by the thermocouple. Forming a [[Negative feedback|Negative Feedback]] loop. This is similar to Heat Flow rate in Cylindrical Pipe.\n\n==Types and uses ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#f0f0f0;\"\n! Extruder name !! Designer !! Mount type !!

This has led to improvements in RP technologies and in particularly of [[Fused Deposition Modeling]].<ref name=\"Liquefier\"/>\nThe Development of Extruders is going rapidly because of open source 3-D printer movement caused by products like RepRap. Consistent improvements are seen in the form of increased heating temperature of liquefier, the over-all control and precision of the process and improved support for wide variety of materials to print, including ceramics.\n\nThe ways extruders are mounted on the  machine has also evolved over time into informal mounting standards. These informal standards include the Vertical X Axis Standard, the Quick-fit extruder mount, the OpenX mount, etc.\n\n== Print head kinematics ==\n[[File:3D printer2.jpg|thumb|RepRap-type printer]]\nThe majority of fused filament printers follow the same basic design. A flat bed is used as the starting point for the print workpiece.  A gantry above this carries the moving print head. The gantry design is optimised for movement mostly in the horizontal X & Y directions, with a slow climb in the Z direction as the piece is printed. [[Stepper motor]]s drive the movement through either [[leadscrew]]s or [[toothed belt]] drives. It is common, owing to the differences in movement speed, to use toothed belts for the X,Y drives and a leadscrew for Z.  Some machines also have X axis movement on the gantry, but move the bed (and print job) for Y.  As, unlike [[laser cutter]]s, head movement speeds are low, stepper motors are universally used and there is no need to use [[servomotor]]s instead.\n\nMany printers, originally those influenced by the [[RepRap]] project, make extensive use of 3D printed components in their own construction. These are typically printed connector blocks with a variety of angled holes, joined by cheap steel [[threaded rod]]. This makes a construction that is cheap and easy to assemble, easily allows non-perpendicular framing joints, but does require access to a 3D printer. The notion of '[[bootstrapping]]' 3D printers like this has been something of a dogmatic theme within the RepRap designs. The lack of stiffness in the rod also requires either [[triangulation (geometry)|triangulation]], or gives the risk of a gantry structure that flexes and vibrates in service, reducing print quality.\n\nMany machines now use box-like semi-enclosed frames of either laser-cut plywood, plastic or pressed steel sheet. These are cheap, rigid and can also be used as the basis for an enclosed print volume, allowing temperature control within it to control warping of the print job.\n\nA handful of machines use polar coordinates instead, usually machines optimised to print objects with circular symmetry. These have a radial gantry movement and a rotating bed. Although there are some potential mechanical advantages to this design for printing hollow cylinders, their different geometry and the resulting non-mainstream approach to print planning still keeps them from being popular as yet. Although it is an easy task for a robot's [[motion planning]] to convert from Cartesian to polar coordinates, gaining any advantage from this design also requires the print slicing algorithms to be aware of the rotational symmetry from the outset.\n\n{{-}}\n=== Rostock printers ===\n[[File:Large delta-style 3D printer.jpg|thumb|upright|Printing by a large delta robot printer]]\nA different approach is taken with 'Rostock' pattern printers, based on a [[delta robot]] mechanism.<ref >{{Cite web\n  |title=Rostock\n  |website=RepRap\n  |url=http://reprap.org/wiki/Rostock\n}}</ref> These have a large open print volume with a three-armed delta robot mounted at the top. This design of robot is noted for its low inertia and ability for fast movement over a large volume. Stability and freedom from vibration when moving a heavy print head on the end of spindly arms is a technical challenge though. This design has mostly been favoured as a means of gaining a large print volume without a large and heavy gantry.  \n\nAs the print head moves the distance of its filament from storage coil to head also changes. This tugging on the filament is another technical challenge to overcome, if it is not to affect print quality.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ball bearing]]\n* [[Fused deposition modeling]]\n* [[Methacrylate]]\n* [[Plastics extrusion]]\n* [[wikt:rod|Rod]]\n* [[RAMPS]]\n* [[Stepper motor]]\n* [[Spindle (textiles)|Spindle]]\n* [[Thermistor]]\n* [[Thermocouple]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|}}\n\n[[Category:Fused filament fabrication| ]]\n[[Category:3D printing]]"}]}}}}
