At a very basic level, hydraulics is the liquid version of [[pneumatics]]. [[Fluid mechanics]] provides the theoretical foundation for hydraulics, which focuses on the applied engineering using the properties of fluids. In [[fluid power]], hydraulics are used for the generation, control, and transmission of [[Power (physics)|power]] by the use of [[pressure|pressurized]] liquids. Hydraulic topics range through some parts of science and most of engineering modules, and cover concepts such as pipe [[Volumetric flow rate|flow]], [[dam]] design, [[fluidics]] and fluid control circuitry, [[pump]]s. The principles of hydraulics are in use naturally in the human make body within the heart and the male erection.<ref>http://www.industrialoutpost.com/human-circulatory-system-heart-modern-hydraulic/{{full|date=November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Meldrum |first1=David R. |last2=Burnett |first2=Arthur L. |last3=Dorey |first3=Grace |last4=Esposito |first4=Katherine |last5=Ignarro |first5=Louis J. |title=Erectile Hydraulics: Maximizing Inflow While Minimizing Outflow |journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=1208\u201320 |year=2014 |pmid=24521101 |doi=10.1111/jsm.12457 }}</ref>\nFree surface hydraulics is the branch of hydraulics dealing with [[free surface]] flow, such as occurring in [[river]]s, [[canal]]s, [[lake]]s, [[estuary|estuaries]] and [[sea]]s. Its sub-field [[open channel flow]] studies the flow in open [[channel (geography)|channels]].\n\nThe word \"hydraulics\" originates from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u1f51\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2}} (''hydraulikos'') which in turn originates from {{lang|grc|\u1f55\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1}} (''hydor'', Greek for [[water]]) and {{lang|grc|\u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2}} (''aulos'', meaning [[plumbing|pipe]]).\n\n==Ancient and medieval era==\n[[File:Tuebingen-gerstenmuehle.jpg|thumb|200px|Waterwheel.]]\nEarly uses of water power date back to [[Mesopotamia]] and [[ancient Egypt]], where [[irrigation]] has been used since the 6th millennium BC and [[water clock]]s had been used since the early 2nd millennium BC. Other early examples of [[water]] power include the [[Qanat]] system in ancient Persia and the [[Turpan water system]] in ancient China.\n\n===Greek / Hellenistic age===\nThe Greeks constructed sophisticated water and hydraulic power systems. An example is the construction by [[Eupalinos]], under a public contract, of a watering channel for [[Samos]], the [[Tunnel of Eupalinos]]. An early example of the usage of hydraulic wheel, probably the earliest in Europe, is the Perachora wheel (3rd century BC).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tomlinson |first1=R.

Hero describes a number of working machines using hydraulic power, such as the [[force pump]], which is known from many Roman sites as having been used for raising water and in fire engines.{{fact|date=November 2016}}\n\n===China===\nIn [[ancient China]] there was [[Sunshu Ao]] (6th century BC), [[Ximen Bao]] (5th century BC), [[Du Shi]] (circa 31 AD), [[Zhang Heng]] (78 - 139 AD), and [[Ma Jun]] (200 - 265 AD), while medieval China had [[Su Song]] (1020 - 1101 AD) and [[Shen Kuo]] (1031\u20131095). Du Shi employed a [[waterwheel]] to power the [[bellows]] of a [[blast furnace]] producing [[cast iron]]. Zhang Heng was the first to employ hydraulics to provide motive power in rotating an [[armillary sphere]] for [[Chinese astronomy|astronomical observation]].{{fact|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Sri Lanka===\n[[File:Sigiriya moat and garden2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Moat and gardens at Sigirya.]]\nIn ancient [[Sri Lanka]], hydraulics were widely used in the ancient kingdoms of [[Anuradhapura]] and [[Polonnaruwa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Documents/Sri%20Lanka%20Study_1.pdf |title=SriLanka-A Country study |author= |year=1990 |work= |publisher=USA Government, Department of Army|accessdate=9 November 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905131619/http://www.marines.mil/news/publications/Documents/Sri%20Lanka%20Study_1.pdf|archivedate=5 September 2012}}{{Dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref> The discovery of the principle of the valve tower, or valve pit, (Bisokotuwa in Sinhalese) for regulating the escape of water is credited to ingenuity more than 2,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://asia.isp.msu.edu/wbwoa/south_asia/sri_lanka/history.htm |title=SriLanka - History|author= |date= |work= |publisher=Asian Studies Center, Michigan State University|accessdate=9 November 2011}}</ref> By the first century AD, several large-scale irrigation works had been completed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/SriLanka.html|title=Traditional SriLanka or Ceylon|author= |date= |work= |publisher=Sam Houston State University|accessdate=9 November 2011}}</ref> Macro- and micro-hydraulics to provide for domestic horticultural and agricultural needs, surface drainage and erosion control, ornamental and recreational water courses and retaining structures and also cooling systems were in place in [[Sigiriya]], [[Sri Lanka]]. The coral on the massive rock at the site includes [[cistern]]s for collecting water.  Large ancient reservoirs of Sri Lanka are Kalawewa (King Dhatusena), Parakrama Samudra (King Parakrama Bahu), Tisa Wewa (King Dutugamunu), Minneriya (King Mahasen)\n\n===Innovations in Ancient Rome===\n[[File:Segovia Aqueduct.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Aqueduct of Segovia]], a 1st-century AD masterpiece.]]\n\nIn [[Ancient Rome]], many different hydraulic applications were developed, including public water supplies, innumerable [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s, power using [[watermill]]s and [[hydraulic mining]]. They were among the first to make use of the [[siphon]] to carry water across valleys, and used [[hushing]] on a large scale to prospect for and then extract metal [[ore]]s. They used [[lead]] widely in [[plumbing]] systems for domestic and public supply, such as feeding [[thermae]].{{fact|date=November 2016}}\n\n[[Hydraulic mining]] was used in the gold-fields of northern [[Spain]], which was conquered by [[Augustus]] in 25 BC. The alluvial [[gold-mine]] of [[Las Medulas]] was one of the largest of their mines. It was worked by at least 7 long aqueducts, and the water streams were used to erode the soft deposits, and then wash the tailings for the valuable gold content.{{fact|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Modern era (c. 1600 \u2013 1870)==\n\n===Benedetto Castelli===\nIn 1619 [[Benedetto Castelli]] (1576 - 1578\u20131643), a student of [[Galileo Galilei]], published the book ''Della Misura dell'Acque Correnti'' or \"On the Measurement of Running Waters\", one of the foundations of modern hydrodynamics. He served as a chief consultant to the Pope on hydraulic projects, i.e., management of rivers in the Papal States, beginning in 1626.<ref>[http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/castelli.html Benedetto Castelli (1576-1578-1643)], [http://galileo.rice.edu/ The Galileo Project]</ref>\n\n===Blaise Pascal===\n[[Blaise Pascal]] (1623\u20131662) studied fluid hydrodynamics and hydrostatics, centered on the principles of hydraulic fluids. His inventions include the [[hydraulic press]], which multiplied a smaller force acting on a smaller area into the application of a larger force totaled over a larger area, transmitted through the same pressure (or same change of pressure) at both locations. [[Pascal's law]] or principle states that for an incompressible fluid at rest, the difference in pressure is proportional to the difference in height and this difference remains the same whether or not the overall pressure of the fluid is changed by applying an external force. This implies that by increasing the pressure at any point in a confined fluid, there is an equal increase at every other point in the container, i.e., any change in pressure applied at any point of the fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluids.\n\n===Jean L\u00e9onard Marie Poiseuille===\nA French physician, [[Jean L\u00e9onard Marie Poiseuille|Poiseuille]] researched the flow of blood through the body and discovered an important law governing the rate of flow with the diameter of the tube in which flow occurred.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n===In the UK===\nSeveral cities developed city-wide [[hydraulic power network]]s in the 19th century, to operate machinery such as lifts, cranes, capstans and the like.
