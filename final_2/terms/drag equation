The formula is accurate only under certain conditions: the objects must have a blunt form factor and the fluid must have a large enough [[Reynolds number]] to produce [[turbulence]] behind the object. The equation is\n;<math>F_D\\, =\\, \\tfrac12\\, \\rho\\, u^2\\, C_D\\, A</math>\n:<math>F_D</math> is the drag [[force]], which is by definition the force component in the direction of the flow velocity,<ref>See [[lift force]] and [[vortex induced vibration]] for a possible force components transverse to the flow direction.</ref>\n:<math>\\rho</math> is the [[mass density]] of the fluid, <ref>Note that for the [[Earth's atmosphere]], the air density can be found using the [[barometric formula]].

For non-hollow objects with simple shape, such as a sphere, this is exactly the same as a [[cross section (geometry)|cross sectional]] area. For other objects (for instance, a rolling tube or the body of a cyclist), ''A'' may be significantly larger than the area of any cross section along any plane perpendicular to the direction of motion. [[Airfoils]] use the square of the [[chord_(aircraft)|chord length]] as the reference area; since airfoil chords are usually defined with a length of 1, the reference area is also 1. Aircraft use the wing area (or rotor-blade area) as the reference area, which makes for an easy comparison to [[lift_(force)|lift]]. [[airship|Airships]] and [[Solid_of_revolution|bodies of revolution]] use the volumetric coefficient of drag, in which the reference area is the square of the cube root of the airship's volume. Sometimes different reference areas are given for the same object in which case a drag coefficient corresponding to each of these different areas must be given.\n\nFor sharp-cornered bluff bodies, like square cylinders and plates held transverse to the flow direction, this equation is applicable with the drag coefficient as a constant value when the [[Reynolds number]] is greater than 1000.<ref>[http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~vawter/PhysicsNet/Topics/Dynamics/Forces/DragForce.html Drag Force<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> For smooth bodies, like a circular cylinder, the drag coefficient may vary significantly until Reynolds numbers up to 10<sup>7</sup> (ten million).<ref>See Batchelor (1967), p. 341.</ref>\n\n== Discussion ==\nThe equation is easier understood for the idealized situation where all of the fluid impinges on the reference area and comes to a complete stop, building up [[Pressure#Stagnation pressure|stagnation pressure]] over the whole area. No real object exactly corresponds to this behavior. ''C<sub>D</sub>'' is the ratio of drag for any real object to that of the ideal object. In practice a rough un-streamlined body (a bluff body) will have a ''C<sub>D</sub>'' around 1, more or less. Smoother objects can have much lower values of ''C<sub>D</sub>''. The equation is precise \u2013 it simply provides the definition of ''C<sub>D</sub>'' ([[drag coefficient]]), which varies with the [[Reynolds number]] and is found by experiment.\n\nOf particular importance is the <math>u^2</math> dependence on flow velocity, meaning that fluid drag increases with the square of flow velocity. When flow velocity is doubled, for example, not only does the fluid strike with twice the flow velocity, but twice the [[mass]] of fluid strikes per second. Therefore the change of [[momentum]] per second is multiplied by four. [[Force]] is equivalent to the change of momentum divided by time. This is in contrast with solid-on-solid [[friction]], which generally has very little flow velocity dependence.\n\n== Derivation == <!-- [[Drag (physics)]] links here -->\nThe '''drag equation''' may be derived to within a multiplicative constant by the method of [[dimensional analysis]]. If a moving fluid meets an object, it exerts a force on the object. Suppose that the variables involved \u2013 under some conditions \u2013 are the:\n* speed ''u'', \n* fluid density ''\u03c1'',\n* viscosity ''\u03bd'' of the fluid, \n* size of the body, expressed in terms of its frontal area ''A'', and \n* drag force ''F<sub>D</sub>''. \nUsing the algorithm of the [[Buckingham \u03c0 theorem]], these five variables can be reduced to two dimensionless parameters: \n* [[drag coefficient]] ''C<sub>D</sub>'' and \n* [[Reynolds number]] ''R''<sub>e</sub>.\n\nAlternatively, the dimensionless parameters via direct manipulation of the variables.\n\nThat this is so becomes apparent when the drag force ''F<sub>D</sub>'' is expressed as part of a function of the other variables in the problem:\n\n:<math>\n  f_a(F_D,\\, u,\\, A,\\, \\rho,\\, \\nu)\\, =\\, 0. \\,\n</math>\n\nThis rather odd form of expression is used because it does not assume a one-to-one relationship.  Here, ''f<sub>a</sub>'' is some (as-yet-unknown) function that takes five arguments. Now the right-hand side is zero in any system of units; so it should  be possible to express the relationship described by ''f<sub>a</sub>'' in terms of only dimensionless groups.\n\nThere are many ways of combining the five arguments of ''f<sub>a</sub>'' to form dimensionless groups, but the [[Buckingham \u03c0 theorem]] states that there will be two such groups.  The most appropriate are the Reynolds number, given by\n\n:<math>\n  \\mathrm{Re}\\, =\\, \\frac{u\\,\\sqrt{A}}{\\nu}\n</math>\n\nand the drag coefficient, given by\n\n:<math>\n  C_D\\, =\\, \\frac{F_D}{\\frac12\\, \\rho\\, A\\, u^2}.\n</math>\n\nThus the function of five variables may be replaced by another function of only two variables:\n\n:<math>\n  f_b\\left( \\frac{F_D}{\\frac12\\, \\rho\\, A\\, u^2},\\, \\frac{u\\, \\sqrt{A}}{\\nu} \\right)\\, =\\, 0.\n</math>\n\nwhere ''f<sub>b</sub>'' is some function of two arguments.\nThe original law is then reduced to a law involving only these two numbers.\n\nBecause the only unknown in the above equation is the drag force ''F<sub>D</sub>'', it is possible to express it as\n\n:<math>\n  \\frac{F_D}{\\frac12\\, \\rho\\, A\\, u^2}\\, =\\, f_c\\left( \\frac{u\\, \\sqrt{A}}{\\nu} \\right)\n</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>\n  F_D\\, =\\, \\tfrac12\\, \\rho\\, A\\, u^2\\, f_c(R_e), \\,\n</math> &nbsp; &nbsp; and with &nbsp; &nbsp; <math> C_D\\, =\\, f_c(R_e).</math>\n\nThus the force is simply \u00bd ''\u03c1'' ''A'' ''u<sup>2</sup>'' times some (as-yet-unknown) function ''f<sub>c</sub>'' of the Reynolds number ''R''<sub>e</sub> \u2013 a considerably simpler system than the original five-argument function given above.  \n\nDimensional analysis thus makes a very complex problem (trying to determine the behavior of a function of five variables) a much simpler one: the determination of the drag as a function of only one variable, the Reynolds number.\n\nThe analysis also gives other information for free, so to speak.  The analysis shows that, other things being equal, the drag force will be proportional to the density of the fluid.  This kind of information often proves to be extremely valuable, especially in the early stages of a research project.\n\nTo empirically determine the Reynolds number dependence, instead of experimenting on huge bodies with fast-flowing fluids (such as real-size airplanes in wind-tunnels), one may just as well experiment on small models with more viscous and higher flow velocity, because these two systems are [[Similitude (model)|similar]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Aerodynamic drag]]\n* [[Angle of attack]]\n* [[Morison equation]]\n* [[Stall (flight)]]\n* [[Terminal velocity]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book\n | first=G.K.\n | last=Batchelor\n | authorlink=George Batchelor\n | title=An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics\n | year=1967\n | publisher=Cambridge University Press\n | isbn=0-521-66396-2 }} \n*{{cite book\n | last = Huntley | first = H.
