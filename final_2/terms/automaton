It's also said that when King Solomon stepped upon the throne, a mechanism was set in motion.

Within it there is a description of a much earlier encounter between [[King Mu of Zhou]] (1023-957 BC) and a mechanical engineer known as Yan Shi, an 'artificer'. The latter proudly presented the king with a life-size, human-shaped figure of his mechanical handiwork ([[Wade-Giles]] spelling):\n\n<blockquote>\nThe king stared at the figure in astonishment. It walked with rapid strides, moving its head up and down, so that anyone would have taken it for a live human being. The artificer touched its chin, and it began singing, perfectly in tune. He touched its hand, and it began posturing, keeping perfect time...As the performance was drawing to an end, the robot winked its eye and made advances to the ladies in attendance, whereupon the king became incensed and would have had Yen Shih [Yan Shi] executed on the spot had not the latter, in mortal fear, instantly taken the robot to pieces to let him see what it really was. And, indeed, it turned out to be only a construction of leather, wood, glue and lacquer, variously coloured white, black, red and blue. Examining it closely, the king found all the internal organs complete\u2014liver, gall, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, stomach and intestines; and over these again, muscles, bones and limbs with their joints, skin, teeth and hair, all of them artificial...The king tried the effect of taking away the heart, and found that the mouth could no longer speak; he took away the liver and the eyes could no longer see; he took away the kidneys and the legs lost their power of locomotion.

At the end of the thirteenth century, [[Robert II, Count of Artois]] built a pleasure garden at his castle at Hesdin that incorporated several automata as entertainment in the walled park. The work was conducted by local workmen and overseen by the Italian knight Renaud Coignet. It included monkey marionettes, a sundial supported by lions and \"wild men\", mechanized birds, mechanized fountains and a bellows-operated organ.

Hero's treatises were edited and translated into Latin and Italian. [[Giovanni Fontana (engineer)|Giovanni Fontana]] created mechanical devils and rocket-propelled animal automata. Numerous clockwork automata were manufactured in the 16th century, principally by the goldsmiths of the [[Free imperial city|Free Imperial Cities]] of central Europe. These wondrous devices found a home in the [[cabinet of curiosities]] or ''Wunderkammern'' of the princely courts of Europe. Hydraulic and pneumatic automata, similar to those described by Hero, were created for garden [[grotto]]es.\n\n[[Leonardo da Vinci]] sketched a more complex automaton around the year 1495. The design of [[Leonardo's robot]] was not rediscovered until the 1950s. The robot could, if built successfully, move its arms, twist its head, and sit up.\n\nThe [[Smithsonian Institution]] has in its collection a clockwork monk, about {{convert|15|in|abbr=on}} high, possibly dating as early as 1560. The monk is driven by a key-wound spring and walks the path of a square, striking his chest with his right arm, while raising and lowering a small wooden cross and rosary in his left hand, turning and nodding his head, rolling his eyes, and mouthing silent obsequies. From time to time, he brings the cross to his lips and kisses it. It is believed that the monk was manufactured by [[Juanelo Turriano]], mechanician to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].<ref>King, Elizabeth. \"Clockwork Prayer: A Sixteenth-Century Mechanical Monk\" ''Blackbird'' 1.1 (2002) [http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/v1n1/nonfiction/king_e/prayer_introduction.htm]</ref>\n\nA new attitude towards automata is to be found in [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] when he suggested that the bodies of animals are nothing more than complex machines - the bones, muscles and organs could be replaced with cogs, pistons and cams. Thus [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]] became the standard to which [[Nature]] and the [[organism]] was compared. [[France]] in the 17th century was the birthplace of those ingenious [[mechanical toy]]s that were to become prototypes for the engines of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Thus, in 1649, when [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] was still a child, an artisan named Camus designed for him a miniature coach, and horses complete with footmen, page and a lady within the coach; all these figures exhibited a perfect movement. According to P. Labat, General de Gennes constructed, in 1688, in addition to machines for gunnery and navigation, a peacock that walked and ate. [[Athanasius Kircher]] produced many automata to create Jesuit shows, including a statue which spoke and listened via a [[speaking tube]].\n\n[[Image:TeaAutomatAndMechanism.jpg|thumb|Tea-serving Japanese automaton, \"[[karakuri ningy\u014d]]\", with mechanism (right), 19th century.]]\n[[Image:Takeda Oumi karakuri.jpg|thumb|A Japanese automata theater in Osaka, drawn in 18th century.

He also constructed the [[Digesting Duck]], a mechanical duck that gave the false illusion of eating and defecating, seeming to endorse Cartesian ideas that animals are no more than machines of flesh.\n\nIn 1769, a chess-playing machine called [[the Turk]], created by [[Wolfgang von Kempelen]], made the rounds of the courts of [[Europe]] purporting to be an automaton. The Turk was operated from inside by a hidden human director, and was not a true automaton.\n\n[[File:Maillardet's automaton at the Franklin Institute.webm|thumb|[[Maillardet's automaton]] is drawing a picture]]\nOther 18th century automaton makers include the prolific Swiss [[Pierre Jaquet-Droz]] (see [[Jaquet-Droz automata]]) and his contemporary [[Henri Maillardet]].

These two registers are quite distinct, since it was a question, on one hand, of submission and use and, on the other, of functioning and explanation: there was a useful body and an intelligible body... The celebrated automata [of the 18th century] were not only a way of illustrating an organism, they were also political puppets, small-scale models of power: Frederick, the meticulous king of small machines, well-trained regiments and long exercises, was obsessed with them.\"</ref> According to [[Manuel de Landa]], \"he put together his armies as a well-oiled [[clockwork]] mechanism whose components were robot-like warriors\".\n\n[[Japan]] adopted automata during the [[Edo period]] (1603\u20131867); they were known as ''[[karakuri ningy\u014d]]''.\n\nAutomata, particularly watches and clocks, were popular in China during the 18th and 19th centuries, and items were produced for the Chinese market.

During this period many small family based companies of Automata makers thrived in Paris. From their workshops they exported thousands of clockwork automata and mechanical singing birds around the world. It is these French automata that are collected today, although now rare and expensive they attract collectors worldwide. The main French makers were [[Blaise Bontems|Bontems]], Lambert, Phalibois, Renou, [[Roullet & Decamps]], Theroude and Vichy.\n\nContemporary automata continue this tradition with an emphasis on art, rather than technological sophistication.
