[[Parabola]]<br />\n2. [[Circle]] and [[ellipse]]<br />\n3. [[Hyperbola]]]]\n[[File:Table of Conics, Cyclopaedia, volume 1, p 304, 1728.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Table of conics, ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'', 1728]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''conic section''' (or simply '''conic''') is a [[curve]] obtained as the intersection of the [[Conical surface|surface]] of a [[cone (geometry)|cone]] with a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]]. The three types of conic section are the [[hyperbola]], the [[parabola]], and the [[ellipse]]. The [[circle]] is a special case of the ellipse, and is of sufficient interest in its own right that it was sometimes called a fourth type of conic section. The conic sections have been studied by the ancient Greek mathematicians with this work culminating around 200 BC, when [[Apollonius of Perga]] undertook a systematic study of their properties.\n\nThere are many distinguishing properties that the conic sections of the [[Euclidean plane]] have, and many of these can be \u2014 and have been \u2014 used as the basis for a definition of the conic sections.  One such property defines a non-circular conic<ref>{{harvnb|Eves|1963|page=319}}</ref> to be the set of those points whose distances to some particular point, called a ''[[Focus (geometry)|focus]]'', and some particular line, called a ''directrix'', are in a fixed ratio, called the ''[[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]]''. The type of conic is determined by the value of the eccentricity. In  [[analytic geometry]], a conic may be defined as a [[algebraic curve|plane algebraic curve]] of degree 2; that is, as the set of points whose coordinates satisfy a [[quadratic equation]] in two variables. This equation may be written in matrix form, and some geometric properties can be studied as algebraic conditions.\n\nIn the Euclidean plane, the conic sections appear to be quite different from one another, but share many properties. By extending the geometry to a projective plane (adding a line at infinity) this apparent difference vanishes, and the commonality becomes evident. Further extension, by expanding the [[Real number|real]] coordinates to admit [[Complex number|complex]] coordinates, provides the means to see this unification algebraically.\n\n==Euclidean geometry==\nThe conic sections have been studied for thousands of years and have provided a rich source of interesting and beautiful results in [[Euclidean geometry]].\n\n===Definition===\n[[File:Conic Sections.svg|300px|right|thumb|The black boundaries of the colored regions are conic sections.]]\n\nA '''conic''' is the curve obtained as the intersection of a [[plane (geometry)|plane]], called the ''cutting plane'', with the surface of a double [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] (a cone with two ''nappes''). We shall assume that the cone is a right circular cone for the purpose of easy description, but this is not required; any double cone with some circular cross-section will suffice. Planes that pass through the vertex of the cone will intersect the cone in a point, a line or a pair of intersecting lines. These are called '''[[#Degenerate cases|degenerate conics]]''' and some authors do not consider them to be conics at all. Unless otherwise stated, we shall assume that \"conic\" refers to a non-degenerate conic.\n \nThere are three types of conics, the [[ellipse]], [[parabola]], and [[hyperbola]].<!-- The order ellipse/parabola/hyperbola is important in discussions and applications; please retain. --> The [[circle]] is a special kind of ellipse, although historically it had been considered as a fourth type (as it was by Apollonius). The [[circle]] and the [[ellipse]] arise when the intersection of the cone and plane is a [[closed curve]]. The circle is obtained when the cutting plane is parallel to the plane of the generating circle of the cone \u2013 for a right cone, see diagram, this means that the cutting plane is perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the cone. If the cutting plane is [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to exactly one generating line of the cone, then the conic is unbounded and is called a ''parabola''. In the remaining case, the figure is a ''hyperbola''.  In this case, the plane will intersect ''both'' halves of the cone, producing two separate unbounded curves.\n\n===Eccentricity, focus and directrix===\n[[File:Eccentricity.svg|right|thumb|280px|<span style=\"color:red;\">Ellipse (''e''=1/2)</span>, <span style=\"color:#00cc00;\">parabola (''e''=1)</span> and <span style=\"color:blue;\">hyperbola (''e''=2)</span> with fixed focus ''F'' and <span style=\"color:black;\">directrix (''e''=\u221e)</span>.]]\nA property that the conic sections share is often presented as the following definition. A ''conic section'' is the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of all points {{mvar|P}} whose distance to a fixed point {{mvar|F}} (called the [[focus (geometry)|'''''focus''''']] of the conic) is a constant multiple (called the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|'''''eccentricity''''']], {{mvar|e}}) of the distance from {{mvar|P}} to a fixed line {{mvar|L}} (called the '''''directrix''''' of the conic). \nFor {{math|0 < ''e'' < 1}} we obtain an ellipse, for {{math|1=''e'' = 1}} a parabola, and for {{math|''e'' > 1}} a hyperbola.\n\nA circle is a limiting case and is not defined by a focus and directrix, ''in the plane'' (however, see the section on the extension to projective planes). The eccentricity of a circle is defined to be zero and its focus is the center of the circle, but there is no line in the Euclidean plane that is its directrix.<ref>{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1999|page=13}}</ref>\n\nAn ellipse and a hyperbola each have two foci and distinct directrices for each of them. The line joining the foci is called the '''principal axis''' and the points of intersection of the conic with the principal axis are called the '''vertices''' of the conic. The line segment joining the vertices of a conic is called the '''major axis''', also called '''transverse axis''' in the hyperbola. The midpoint of this line segment is called the '''center''' of the conic.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|Tracey|1925|pages=111\u2013124}}</ref> Let {{mvar|a}} denote the distance from the center to a vertex of an ellipse or hyperbola.

Recall that the ''principal axis is'' the line joining the foci of an ellipse or hyperbola, and the ''center'' in these cases is the midpoint of the line segment joining the foci. Some of the other common features and/or parameters of conics are given below.\n\nThe '''linear eccentricity''' ({{math|''c''}}) is the distance between the center and the focus (or one of the two foci).\n\nThe '''latus rectum''' is the [[Chord (geometry)|chord]] parallel to the directrix and passing through the focus (or one of the two foci). Its length is denoted by {{math|2''\u2113''}}.\n\nThe '''semi-latus rectum''' ({{math|''\u2113''}}) is half of the length of the latus rectum.\n\nThe '''focal parameter''' ({{math|''p''}}) is  the distance from the focus (or one of the two foci) to the directrix.\n\nWhen an ellipse or hyperbola are in standard position (the principle axis is the {{mvar|x}}-axis and the center is the origin) the vertices of the conic have coordinates {{math|(\u2212''a'', 0)}} and {{math|(''a'',0)}}, with {{mvar|a}} non-negative.\n\nThe '''[[semi-major axis]]''' is the value {{mvar|a}}.\n\nThe '''semi-minor axis''' is the value {{math|''b''}} in the standard Cartesian equation of the ellipse or hyperbola.\n\nThe following relations hold:\n* <math>p e = \\ell \\, </math>\n* <math>a e = c. \\, </math>\n\nThese parameters are related as shown in the following table, where the standard position is assumed.

Cones were constructed by rotating a right triangle about one of its legs so the hypotenuse generates the surface of the cone (such a line is called a [[wiktionary:generatrix|generatrix]]). Three types of cones were determined by their vertex angles (measured by twice the angle formed by the hypotenuse and the leg being rotated about in the right triangle). The conic section was then determined by intersecting one of these cones with a plane drawn perpendicular to a generatrix. The type of the conic is determined by the type of cone, that is, by the angle formed at the vertex of the cone: If the angle is acute then the conic is an ellipse; if the angle is right then the conic is a parabola; and if the angle is obtuse then the conic is a hyperbola (but only one branch of the curve).<ref>{{harvnb|Katz|1998|page=117}}</ref>\n\n[[Euclid]] (fl. 300 BCE) is said to have written four books on conics but these were lost as well.<ref>Heath, T.L., ''The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements'', Vol. I, Dover, 1956, pg.16</ref> [[Archimedes]] (died  c.\u2009212 BCE) is known to have studied conics, having determined the area bounded by a parabola and a chord in ''Quadrature of the Parabola''.

Apollonius's study of the properties of these curves made it possible to show that any plane cutting a fixed double cone (two napped), regardless of its angle, will produce a conic according to the earlier definition, leading to the definition commonly used today. Circles, not constructible by the earlier method, are also obtainable in this way. This may account for why Apollonius considered circles a fourth type of conic section, a distinction that is no longer made. Apollonius used the names ''ellipse'', ''parabola'' and ''hyperbola'' for these curves, borrowing the terminology from earlier Pythagorean work on areas.<ref>{{harvnb|Eves|1963|page=30}}</ref>\n\n[[Pappus of Alexandria]] (died c. 350 CE) is credited with expounding on the importance of the concept of a conic's focus, and detailing the related concept of a [[#Eccentricity, focus and directrix|directrix]], including the case of the parabola (which is lacking in Apollonius's known works).<ref>{{harvnb|Boyer|2004|page=36}}</ref>\n\n===Al-Kuhi===\nAn instrument for drawing conic sections was first described in 1000 CE by the Islamic mathematician [[Al-Kuhi]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Stillwell|first=John|title=Mathematics and its history|year=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=1-4419-6052-X|page=30|edition=3rd}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Apollonius of Perga Conics Books One to Seven|url=http://www.math.psu.edu/katok_s/Commentaries-new.pdf|accessdate=10 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Omar Khayy\u00e1m===\nApollonius's work was translated into Arabic and much of his work only survives through the Arabic version.

In particular, Pascal discovered a theorem known as the [[hexagrammum mysticum]] from which many other properties of conics can be deduced.\n\n[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] and [[Pierre Fermat]] both applied their newly discovered [[analytic geometry]] to the study of conics. This had the effect of reducing the geometrical problems of conics to problems in algebra. However, it was [[John Wallis]] in his 1655 treatise ''Tractatus de sectionibus conicis'' who first defined the conic sections as instances of equations of second degree.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyer|2004|page=110}}</ref> Written earlier, but published later, Jan de Witt's ''Elementa curvarum'' starts with Kepler's [[Kinematics|kinematic]] construction of the conics and then develops the algebraic equations.

If they are bound together, they will both trace out ellipses; if they are moving apart, they will both follow parabolas or hyperbolas. See [[two-body problem]].\n\nFor certain [[fossil]]s in [[paleontology]], understanding conic sections can help understand the three-dimensional shape of certain organisms.\n\nThe reflective properties of the conic sections are used in the design of searchlights, radio-telescopes and some optical telescopes.<ref>{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1999|page=27}}</ref> A parabolic mirror is used as the reflector, with a bulb at the focus, in a searchlight. The 4.2 meter Herschel optical telescope on La Palma, in the Canary islands, uses a primary parabolic mirror to reflect light towards a secondary hyperbolic mirror, which reflects it again to a focus behind the first mirror.\n\n==In the real projective plane==\nThe conic sections have some very similar properties in the Euclidean plane and the reasons for this become clearer when the conics are viewed from the perspective of a larger geometry. The Euclidean plane may be embedded in the [[real projective plane]] and the conics may be considered as objects in this projective geometry. One way to do this is to introduce [[homogeneous coordinates]] and define a conic to be the set of points whose coordinates satisfy an irreducible quadratic equation in three variables (or equivalently, the zeros of an irreducible [[quadratic form]]). More technically, the set of points that are zeros of a quadratic form (in any number of variables) is called a [[quadric]], and the irreducible quadrics in a two dimensional projective space (that is, having three variables) are traditionally called conics.\n\nThe Euclidean plane {{math|''R''<sup>2</sup>}} is embedded in the real projective plane by adjoining a [[line at infinity]] (and its corresponding [[Point at infinity|points at infinity]]) so that all the lines of a parallel class meet on this line. On the other hand, starting with the real projective plane, a Euclidean plane is obtained by distinguishing some line as the line at infinity and removing it and all its points.\n\n===Intersection at infinity===\nWe can classify the conic sections, as they appear in the Euclidean plane, by how they intersect the line at infinity.\n* ellipses intersect the line at infinity in 0 points;\n* parabolas intersect the line at infinity in 1 [[double point]], corresponding to the axis\u2014 that is, they are tangent to the line at infinity, and close at a point at infinity forming an ellipse;\n* hyperbolas intersect the line at infinity in 2 points, corresponding to the asymptotes\u2014hyperbolas pass through infinity, with a twist. Going to infinity along one branch passes through the point at infinity corresponding to the asymptote, then  re-emerges on the other branch at the other side but with the inside of the hyperbola (the direction of curvature) on the other side \u2013 left vs. right (corresponding to the [[non-orientable|non-orientability]] of the [[real projective plane]])\u2014and then passing through the other point at infinity returns to the first branch. Hyperbolas can thus be seen as ellipses that have been pulled through infinity and re-emerged on the other side, flipped.\n\nIn [[projective space]], over any division ring, but in particular over either the real or complex numbers, all non-degenerate conics are equivalent, and thus in projective geometry one simply speaks of \"a conic\" without specifying a type, as type is not meaningful in this context. Geometrically, the line at infinity is not special, so while some conics intersect the line at infinity differently, this can be changed by a projective transformation \u2013 pulling an ellipse out to infinity or pushing a parabola off infinity to an ellipse or a hyperbola.\n\n===Homogeneous coordinates===\nIn [[homogeneous coordinates]] a conic section can be represented as:\n\n:<math>Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 +Dxz + Eyz + Fz^2 = 0. </math>\n\nOr in [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] notation\n\n: <math>\\left(\\begin{matrix}x & y & z\\end{matrix}\\right) \\left( \\begin{matrix}A & B/2 & D/2\\\\B/2 & C & E/2\\\\D/2&E/2&F\\end{matrix}\\right) \\left(\\begin{matrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\end{matrix}\\right) = 0. </math>\n\nThe 3 &times; 3 matrix above is called ''the matrix of the conic section''.\n\nSome authors prefer to write the general homogeneous equation as\n\n:<math>Ax^2 + 2Bxy + Cy^2 +2Dxz + 2Eyz + Fz^2 = 0, </math>\n\n(or some variation of this) so that the matrix of the conic section has the simpler form,\n\n:<math>M = \\left( \\begin{matrix}A & B & D\\\\B & C & E\\\\D&E&F\\end{matrix}\\right),</math>\n\nbut we shall not use this notation.<ref>This form of the equation does not generalize to fields of characteristic two (see below)</ref>\n\nIf the determinant of the matrix of the conic section is zero, the conic section is [[#degenerate conics|degenerate]].\n\nAs multiplying all six coefficients by the same non-zero scalar yields an equation with the same set of zeros, one can consider conics, represented by {{math|(''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''E'', ''F'')}} as points in the five-dimensional [[projective space]] <math>\\mathbf{P}^5.</math>\n\n===Projective definition of a circle===\n[[Metric space|Metrical]] concepts of Euclidean geometry (concepts concerned with measuring lengths and angles) can not be immediately extended to the real projective plane.<ref>Consider finding the midpoint of a line segment with one endpoint on the line at infinity.</ref> They must be redefined (and generalized) in this new geometry. This can be done for arbitrary [[projective plane]]s, but to obtain the real projective plane as the extended Euclidean plane, some specific choices have to be made.<ref>{{harvnb|Faulkner|1952|page=71}}</ref>\n\nFix an arbitrary line in a projective plane that shall be referred to as the '''absolute line'''. Select two distinct points on the absolute line and refer to them as '''absolute points'''. Several metrical concepts can be defined with reference to these choices. For instance, given a line containing the points {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}}, the '''midpoint''' of line segment {{mvar|AB}} is defined as the point {{mvar|C}} which is the [[projective harmonic conjugate]] of the point of intersection of {{mvar|AB}} and the absolute line, with respect to {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}}.\n\nA conic in a projective plane that contains the two absolute points is called a '''circle'''. Since five points determine a conic, a circle (which may be degenerate) is determined by three points. To obtain the extended Euclidean plane, the absolute line is chosen to be the line at infinity of the Euclidean plane and the absolute points are two special points on that line called the [[circular points at infinity]]. Lines containing two points with real coordinates do not pass through the circular points at infinity, so in the Euclidean plane a circle, under this definition, is determined by three points that are not [[collinear]].<ref>{{harvnb|Faulkner|1952|page=72}}</ref>\n\nIt has been mentioned that circles in the Euclidean plane can not be defined by the focus-directrix property. However, if one were to consider the line at infinity as the directrix, then by taking the eccentricity to be {{math|1=''e'' = 0}} a circle will have the focus-directrix property, but it is still not defined by that property.<ref>{{harvnb|Eves|1963|page=320}}</ref> One must be careful in this situation to correctly use the definition of eccentricity as the ratio of the distance of a point on the circle to the focus (length of a radius) to the distance of that point to the directrix (this distance is infinite) which gives the limiting value of zero.\n\n===Steiner's projective conic definition===\n{{main|Steiner conic}}\n[[File:Steiner-erz-def-s.svg|thumb|Definition of the Steiner generation of a conic section]]\nA [[Synthetic geometry|synthetic]] (without the use of coordinates) approach to defining the conic sections in a projective plane was given by [[Jakob Steiner]] in 1867.\n\n*Given two pencils <math>B(U),B(V)</math> of lines at two points <math>U,V</math> (all lines containing <math>U</math> and  <math>V</math> resp.) and a [[projectivity|projective]] but not [[perspectivity|perspective]] mapping <math>\\pi</math> of <math>B(U)</math> onto <math>B(V)</math>.

These 5 items (2 points, 3 lines) uniquely determine the conic section.\n\n===Line conics===\nBy the [[Duality (projective geometry)|Principle of Duality]] in a projective plane, the dual of each point is a line, and the dual of a locus of points (a set of points satisfying some condition) is called an ''envelope'' of lines. Using Steiner's definition of a conic (this locus of points will now be referred to as a ''point conic'') as the meet of corresponding rays of two related pencils, it is easy to dualize and obtain the corresponding envelope consisting of the joins of corresponding points of two related ranges (points on a line) on different bases (the lines the points are on). Such an envelope is called a '''line conic''' (or '''dual conic''').\n \nIn the real projective plane, a point conic has the property that every line meets it in two points (which may coincide, or may be complex) and any set of points with this property is a point conic. It follows dually that a line conic has two of its lines through every point and any envelope of lines with this property is a line conic. At every point of a point conic there is a unique tangent line, and dually, on every line of a line conic there is a unique point called a ''point of contact''. An important theorem states that the tangent lines of a point conic form a line conic, and dually, the points of contact of a line conic form a point conic.<ref>{{harvnb|Faulkner|1952|pages=48\u201349}}</ref>\n\n===Von Staudt's definition===\n{{main|Von Staudt conic}}\n[[Karl Georg Christian von Staudt]] defined a conic as the point set given by all the absolute points of a [[Pole and polar|polarity]] that has absolute points. Von Staudt introduced this definition in ''Geometrie der Lage'' (1847) as part of his attempt to remove all metrical concepts from projective geometry.\n\nA '''polarity''', {{pi}}, of a projective plane, {{mvar|''P''}}, is an involutory (i.e., of order two) [[bijection]] between the points and the lines of {{mvar|''P''}} that preserves the [[Incidence (geometry)|incidence relation]]. Thus, a polarity relates a point {{mvar|''Q''}} with a line {{mvar|''q''}} and, following [[Gergonne]], {{mvar|''q''}} is called the '''polar''' of {{mvar|''Q''}} and {{mvar|''Q''}} the '''pole''' of {{mvar|''q''}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Coxeter|1964|page=60}}</ref> An '''absolute point''' ('''line''') of a polarity is one which is incident with its polar (pole).<ref>Coxeter and several other authors use the term ''self-conjugate'' instead of absolute.</ref>\n\nA von Staudt conic in the real projective plane is equivalent to a [[Steiner conic]].<ref>{{harvnb|Coxeter|1964|page=80}}</ref>\n\n===Constructions===\nA conic can not be constructed as a continuous curve (or two) with straightedge and compass. However, there are several methods that are used to construct as many individual points on a conic, with straightedge and compass, as desired.\n\nOne of them is based on the converse of Pascal's theorem, namely, ''if the points of intersection of opposite sides of a hexagon are collinear, then the six vertices lie on a conic.'' Specifically, given five points, {{math|''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''E''}} and a line passing through {{mvar|E}}, say {{math|{{overline|''EG''}}}}, we can construct a point {{mvar|F}} that lies on this line and is on the conic determined by the five points. Let {{math|{{overline|''AB''}}}} meet {{math|{{overline|''DE''}}}} in {{mvar|L}}, {{math|{{overline|''BC''}}}} meet {{math|{{overline|''EG''}}}} in {{mvar|M}} and let {{math|{{overline|''CD''}}}} meet {{math|{{overline|''LM''}}}} at {{mvar|N}}. Then {{math|{{overline|''AN''}}}} meets {{math|{{overline|''EG''}}}} at the required point {{mvar|F}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Faulkner|1952|pages=52\u201353}}</ref> By varying the line through {{mvar|E}}, we can construct as many additional points on the conic as desired.\n\n[[File:Ellipse construction - parallelogram method.gif|thumb|Parallelogram method for constructing an ellipse]]\nAnother method, based on Steiner's construction and which is useful in engineering applications, is the '''parallelogram method''', where a conic is constructed point by point by means of connecting certain equally spaced points on a horizontal line and a vertical line.<ref>{{harvnb|Downs|2003|page=5}}</ref> Specifically, to construct the ellipse with equation {{math|1={{sfrac|''x''<sup>2</sup>|''a''<sup>2</sup>}} + {{sfrac|''y''<sup>2</sup>|''b''<sup>2</sup>}} = 1}}, first construct the rectangle {{math|''ABCD''}} with vertices {{math|''A''(''a'', 0), ''B''(''a'', 2''b''), ''C''(\u2212''a'', 2''b'')}} and  {{math|''D''(\u2212''a'', 0)}}. Divide the side {{math|{{overline|''BC''}}}} into {{mvar|n}} equal segments and use parallel projection, with respect to the diagonal {{math|{{overline|''AC''}}}}, to form equal segments on side {{math|{{overline|''AB''}}}} (the lengths of these segments will be {{math|{{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}} times the length of the segments on {{math|{{overline|''BC''}}}}). On the side {{math|{{overline|''BC''}}}} label the left-hand endpoints of the segments with {{math|''A''<sub>1</sub>}} to {{math|''A''<sub>n</sub>}} starting at {{mvar|B}} and going towards {{mvar|C}}. On the side {{math|{{overline|''AB''}}}} label the upper endpoints {{math|''D''<sub>1</sub>}} to {{math|''D''<sub>n</sub>}} starting at {{mvar|A}} and going towards {{mvar|B}}. The points of intersection, {{math|{{overline|''AA''}}<sub>i</sub> \u2229 {{overline|''DD''}}<sub>i</sub>}} for {{math|1 \u2264 ''i'' \u2264 ''n''}} will be points of the ellipse between {{mvar|A}} and {{math|''P''(0, ''b'')}}. The labeling associates the lines of the pencil through {{mvar|A}} with the lines of the pencil through {{mvar|D}} projectively but not perspectively. The sought for conic is obtained by this construction since three points {{math|''A'', ''D''}} and {{mvar|P}} and two tangents (the vertical lines at {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|D}}) uniquely determine the conic. If another diameter (and its conjugate diameter) are used instead of the major and minor axes of the ellipse, a parallelogram that is not a rectangle is used in the construction, giving the name of the method. The association of lines of the pencils can be extended to obtain other points on the ellipse. The constructions for hyperbolas<ref>{{harvnb|Downs|2003|page=14}}</ref> and parabolas<ref>{{harvnb|Downs|2003|page=19}}</ref> are similar.\n\nYet another general method uses the polarity property to construct the tangent envelope of a conic (a line conic).<ref>{{harvnb|Akopyan|Zaslavsky|2007|page=70}}</ref>\n\n==In the complex projective plane==\n\nFurther unification is possible if one allows [[complex number]]s as coefficients. In the [[complex projective plane]] the non-degenerate conics can not be distinguished from one another.\n\nOver the complex numbers ellipses and hyperbolas are not distinct, since \u22121 is a square; precisely, the ellipse <math>x^2+y^2=1</math> becomes a hyperbola under the substitution <math>y=iw,</math> geometrically a complex rotation, yielding <math>x^2-w^2=1</math> \u2013 a hyperbola is simply an ellipse with an imaginary axis length. Thus there is a 2-way classification: ellipse/hyperbola and parabola. Geometrically, this corresponds to intersecting the line at infinity in either 2 distinct points (corresponding to two asymptotes) or in 1 double point (corresponding to the axis of a parabola), and thus the real hyperbola is a more suggestive image for the complex ellipse/hyperbola, as it also has 2 (real) intersections with the line at infinity.\n\nIt can be proven that in the [[complex projective plane]] '''CP<sup>2</sup>''' two conic sections have four points in common (if one accounts for [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]), so there are never more than 4 [[Line-line intersection|intersection]] points and there is always one ''intersection point'' (possibilities: four distinct intersection points, two singular intersection points and one double intersection points, two double intersection points, one singular intersection point and 1 with multiplicity 3, 1 intersection point with multiplicity 4). If there exists at least one intersection point with multiplicity > 1, then the two conic sections are said to be [[tangent]]. If there is only one intersection point, which has multiplicity 4, the two conic sections are said to be osculating.<ref>{{Citation |first=E.

If the intersection point is double, the line is said to be tangent and it is called the [[tangent line]].\nBecause every straight line intersects a conic section twice, each conic section has two points at [[Real projective plane|infinity]] (the intersection points with the [[line at infinity]]). If these points are real, the conic section must be a [[hyperbola]], if they are imaginary conjugated, the conic section must be an [[ellipse]], if the conic section has one double point at infinity it is a [[parabola]]. If the points at infinity are (1,i,0) and (1,-i,0), the conic section is a [[circle]] (see [[circular points at infinity]]). If a conic section has one real and one imaginary point at infinity or it has two imaginary points that are not conjugated then it not a real conic section (its coefficients are complex).\n\n{{anchor|Degenerate conics}}\n\n==Degenerate cases==\n{{details|Degenerate conic}}\n\nWhat should be considered as a '''degenerate case''' of a conic depends on the definition being used and the geometric setting for the conic section. There are some authors who define a conic as a two-dimensional nondegenerate quadric. With this terminology there are no degenerate conics (only degenerate quadrics), but we shall use the more traditional terminology and avoid that definition.\n\nIn the Euclidean plane, using the geometric definition, a degenerate case arises when the cutting plane passes through the [[wiktionary:apex|apex]] of the cone.\nThe degenerate conic is either: a [[point (geometry)|point]], when the plane intersects the cone only at the apex; a [[straight line]], when the plane is tangent to the cone (it contains exactly one generator of the cone); or a pair of intersecting lines (two generators of the cone).<ref>{{harvnb|Brannan|Esplen|Gray|1999|page=6}}</ref> These correspond respectively to the limiting forms of an ellipse, parabola, and a hyperbola.\n\nIf a conic in the Euclidean plane is being defined by the zeros of a quadratic equation (that is, as a quadric), then the degenerate conics are: the [[empty set]], a point, or a pair of lines which may be parallel, intersect at a point, or coincide. The two lines case occurs when the quadratic expression factors into two linear factors, the zeros of each giving a line. In the case that the factors are the same, the corresponding lines coincide and we refer to the line as   \na ''double'' line (a line with [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] 2) and this is the previous case of a tangent cutting plane.\n\nIn the real projective plane, since parallel lines meet at a point on the line at infinity, the parallel line case of the Euclidean plane can be viewed as intersecting lines. However, as the point of intersection is the apex of the cone, the cone itself degenerates to a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], i.e. with the apex at infinity. Other sections in this case are called ''cylindric sections''.<ref>{{cite web | title=MathWorld: Cylindric section| url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CylindricSection.html}}</ref> The non-degenerate cylindrical sections are ellipses (or circles).\n\nWhen viewed from the perspective of the complex projective plane, the degenerate cases of a real quadric (i.e., the quadratic equation has real coefficients) can all be considered as a pair of lines, possibly coinciding. The empty set may be the line at infinity considered as a double line, a (real) point is the intersection of two [[complex conjugate line]]s and the other cases as previously mentioned.\n\nTo distinguish the degenerate cases from the non-degenerate cases (including the empty set with the latter) using matrix notation, let {{math|''\u2206''}} be the determinant of the 3&times;3 matrix of the conic section: that is, {{math|1=''\u2206'' = (''AC'' - {{sfrac|''B''<sup>2</sup>|4}})''F'' + {{sfrac|''BED'' - ''CD''<sup>2</sup> - ''AE''<sup>2</sup>|4}}}} and let {{math|1=''\u03b1'' = ''B''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 4''AC''}} be the discriminant. Then the conic section is non-degenerate if and only if {{math|''\u2206'' \u2260 0}}.  If {{math|1=''\u2206'' = 0}} we have a point when {{math|''\u03b1'' < 0}}, two parallel lines (possibly coinciding) when {{math|1=''\u03b1'' = 0}}, or two intersecting lines when {{math|''\u03b1'' > 0}}.<ref>{{citation|last=Lawrence|first=J.

The mathematical formulation for a general conic section, with the other focus if any placed at a positive value (for an ellipse) or a negative value (for a hyperbola) on the horizontal axis, is then given in the polar form by\n\n:<math>r=\\frac{l}{1-e\\cos\\theta}</math>\n\nand in the Cartesian form by\n\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{7}\n\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}} = \\left(l+e x\\right) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\left(\\frac{x-\\frac{le}{1-e^{2}}}{\\frac{l}{1-e^{2}}}\\right)^{2}+\\frac{\\left(1-e^{2}\\right)y^{2}}{l^{2}} = 1 \n\\end{alignat}</math>\nFrom the above equation, the '''linear eccentricity''' (''c'') is given by\n<math>c=\\left(\\frac{le}{1-e^{2}}\\right)</math>.\n\nFrom the general equations given above, different conic sections can be represented as shown below:\n*Circle: <math>x^2+y^2=r^2 \\,</math>\n*Ellipse: <math>\\frac{\\left(x-\\sqrt{a^{2}-b^{2}}\\right)^{2}}{a^{2}}+\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1</math>\n*Parabola: <math>y^{2}=4a\\left(x+a\\right)</math>\n*Hyperbola: <math>\\frac{\\left(x+\\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}\\right)^{2}}{a^{2}}-\\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1</math>\n-->\n\n== Pencil of conics ==\nA (non-degenerate) conic is completely determined by [[Five points determine a conic|five points]] in general position (no three collinear) in a plane and the system of conics which pass through a fixed set of four points (again in a plane and no three collinear) is called a '''pencil of conics'''.<ref>{{harvnb|Faulkner|1952|loc=pg. 64}}</ref> The four common points are called the ''base points'' of the pencil. Through any point other than a base point, there passes a single conic of the pencil. This concept generalizes a [[pencil of circles]].\n\nIn a [[projective plane]] defined over an [[algebraically closed field]] any two conics meet in four points (counted with multiplicity) and so, determine the pencil of conics based on these four points. Furthermore, the four base points determine three line pairs ([[degenerate conic]]s through the base points, each line of the pair containing exactly two base points) and so each pencil of conics will contain at most three degenerate conics.<ref>{{harvnb|Samuel|1988|loc=pg. 50}}</ref>\n\nA pencil of conics can represented algebraically in the following way. Let {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''C''<sub>2</sub>}} be two distinct conics in a projective plane defined over an algebraically closed field {{math|''K''}}. For every pair {{math|''\u03bb'', ''\u03bc''}} of elements of {{math|''K''}}, not both zero, the expression:\n\n::<math>\\lambda C_1 + \\mu C_2</math>\n\nrepresents a conic in the pencil determined by {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''C''<sub>2</sub>}}. This symbolic representation can be made concrete with a slight abuse of notation (using the same notation to denote the object as well as the equation defining the object.) Thinking of {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}}, say, as a ternary [[quadratic form]], then {{math|1=''C''<sub>1</sub> = 0}} is the equation of the \"conic {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}}\". Another concrete realization would be obtained by thinking of {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}} as the [[#Homogeneous coordinates|3&times;3 symmetric matrix]] which represents it. If {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''C''<sub>2</sub>}} have such concrete realizations then every member of the above pencil will as well. Since the setting uses homogeneous coordinates in a projective plane, two concrete representations (either equations or matrices) give the same conic if they differ by a non-zero multiplicative constant.\n\n== Intersecting two conics ==\nThe solutions to a system of two second degree equations in two variables may be viewed as the coordinates of the points of intersection of two generic conic sections.\nIn particular two conics may possess none, two or four possibly coincident intersection points.\nAn efficient method of locating these solutions exploits the homogeneous [[matrix representation of conic sections]], i.e. a 3x3 [[symmetric matrix]] which depends on six parameters.\n\nThe procedure to locate the intersection points follows these steps, where the conics are represented by matrices:\n* given the two conics <math>C_1</math> and <math>C_2</math>, consider the pencil of conics given by their linear combination <math>\\lambda C_1 + \\mu C_2.</math>\n* identify the homogeneous parameters <math>(\\lambda,\\mu)</math> which correspond to the degenerate conic of the pencil. This can be done by imposing the condition that <math>\\det(\\lambda C_1 + \\mu C_2) = 0</math> and solving for <math>\\lambda</math> and <math>\\mu</math>. These turn out to be the solutions of a third degree equation.\n* given the degenerate conic <math>C_0</math>, identify the two, possibly coincident, lines constituting it.\n* intersect each identified line with either one of the two original conics; this step can be done efficiently using the dual conic representation of <math>C_0</math>\n* the points of intersection will represent the solutions to the initial equation system.\n\n==Generalizations==\nConics may be defined over other fields (that is, in other [[pappian plane|pappian geometries]]), but some care must be used when the field has [[Characteristic (field)|characteristic]] two as some formulae can not be used. For example, the usual matrix representation of a quadratic form.\n\nA generalization of a non degenerate conic in a projective plane is an [[oval (projective plane)|oval]]. An oval is a point set that has the following properties, which are held by conics: 1) any line intersects an oval in none, one or two points, 2) at any point of the oval there exists a unique tangent line.\n\nGeneralizing the focus properties of conics to the case where there are more than two foci produces sets called [[generalized conic]]s.\n\n==In other areas of mathematics==\nThe classification into elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic is pervasive in mathematics, and often divides a field into sharply distinct subfields. The classification mostly arises due to the presence of a quadratic form (in two variables this corresponds to the associated [[discriminant]]), but can also correspond to eccentricity.\n\nQuadratic form classifications:\n;[[Quadratic form]]s: Quadratic forms over the reals are classified by [[Sylvester's law of inertia]], namely by their positive index, zero index, and negative index: a quadratic form in ''n'' variables can be converted to a [[diagonal form]], as <math>x_1^2+x_2^2+\\cdots+x_k^2-x_{k+1}^2-\\cdots-x_{k+l}^2,</math> where the number of +1 coefficients, ''k,'' is the positive index, the number of \u22121 coefficients, ''l,'' is the negative index, and the remaining variables are the zero index ''m,'' so <math>k+l+m=n.</math> In two variables the non-zero quadratic forms are classified as:\n:* <math>x^2+y^2</math> \u2013 positive-definite (the negative is also included), corresponding to ellipses,\n:* <math>x^2</math> \u2013 degenerate, corresponding to parabolas, and\n:* <math>x^2-y^2</math> \u2013 indefinite, corresponding to hyperbolas.\n:In two variables quadratic forms are classified by discriminant, analogously to conics, but in higher dimensions the more useful classification is as ''definite,'' (all positive or all negative), ''degenerate,'' (some zeros), or ''indefinite'' (mix of positive and negative but no zeros). This classification underlies many that follow.\n;Curvature: The [[Gaussian curvature]] of a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] describes the infinitesimal geometry, and may at each point be either positive \u2013 [[elliptic geometry]], zero \u2013 [[Euclidean geometry]] (flat, parabola), or negative \u2013 [[hyperbolic geometry]]; infinitesimally, to second order the surface looks like the graph of <math>x^2+y^2,</math> <math>x^2</math> (or 0), or <math>x^2-y^2</math>. Indeed, by the [[uniformization theorem]] every surface can be taken to be globally (at every point) positively curved, flat, or negatively curved. In higher dimensions the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] is a more complicated object, but [[manifolds with constant sectional curvature]] are interesting objects of study, and have strikingly different properties, as discussed at [[sectional curvature]].\n;Second order PDEs: [[Partial differential equation]]s (PDEs) of [[Partial differential equation#Equations of second order|second order]] are classified at each point as elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic, accordingly as their second order terms correspond to an elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic quadratic form. The behavior and theory of these different types of PDEs are strikingly different \u2013 representative examples is that the [[Poisson equation]] is elliptic, the [[heat equation]] is parabolic, and the [[wave equation]] is hyperbolic.\n\n[[Eccentricity (mathematics)#Analogous classifications|Eccentricity classifications]] include:\n;[[M\u00f6bius transformation]]s: Real M\u00f6bius transformations (elements of [[PSL2(R)|PSL<sub>2</sub>('''R''')]] or its 2-fold cover, [[SL2(R)|SL<sub>2</sub>('''R''')]]) are [[M\u00f6bius transformation#Classification|classified]] as elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic accordingly as their half-trace is <math>0\\leq |\\operatorname{tr}|/2 < 1,</math> <math>|\\operatorname{tr}|/2 = 1,</math> or <math>|\\operatorname{tr}|/2 > 1,</math> mirroring the classification by eccentricity.\n;[[Variance-to-mean ratio]]: The variance-to-mean ratio classifies several important families of [[discrete probability distribution]]s: the constant distribution as circular (eccentricity 0), [[binomial distribution]]s as elliptical, [[Poisson distribution]]s as parabolic, and [[negative binomial distribution]]s as hyperbolic. This is elaborated at [[Cumulant#Cumulants of some discrete probability distributions|cumulants of some discrete probability distributions]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Circumconic and inconic]]\n* [[Conic Sections Rebellion]], protests by Yale university students\n* [[Director circle]]\n* [[Elliptic coordinate system]]\n* [[Equidistant set]]\n* [[Nine-point conic]]\n* [[Parabolic coordinates]]\n* [[Quadratic function]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |author1=Akopyan, A.V.  |author2=Zaslavsky, A.A. | title=Geometry of Conics | publisher=American Mathematical Society | year=2007 | isbn=0-8218-4323-0 }}\n* {{citation|first=Carl B.|last=Boyer|title=History of Analytic Geometry|publisher=Dover|year=2004|origyear=1956|isbn=978-0-486-43832-0}}\n* {{citation|first1=David A.|last1=Brannan|first2=Matthew F.|last2=Esplen|first3=Jeremy J.|last3=Gray|title=Geometry|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-59787-6}}\n* {{citation|first=H.
