Heinlein]] which features a man who invents and uses such devices),<ref>[http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=23 Technovelgy telemanipulator page]</ref> is a device which, through [[Electronics|electronic]], [[hydraulic]], or [[Machine|mechanical]] linkages, allows a [[hand]]-like mechanism to be controlled by a [[human]] operator. The purpose of such a device is usually to move or manipulate hazardous materials for reasons of [[safety]], similar to the operation and play of a [[claw crane]] game.\n\n==History==\nIn 1945, the company Central Research Laboratories<ref>[http://www.destaco.com/crl-products-equipment.html CRL history]</ref> was given the [[contract]] to develop a remote manipulator for the [[Argonne National Laboratory]].  The intent was to replace devices which manipulated highly [[radioactivity|radioactive]] materials from above a sealed chamber or [[hot cell]], with a mechanism which operated through the side wall of the chamber, allowing a researcher to stand normally while working.\n\nThe result was the '''Master-Slave Manipulator Mk. 8''', or MSM-8, which became the iconic remote manipulator<ref>[http://www.destaco.com/telemanipulators.html Telemanipulator page]</ref> seen in newsreels and movies, such as the ''[[The Andromeda Strain (film)|Andromeda Strain]]'' or ''[[THX 1138]]''.\n\n[[Robert A. Heinlein]] claimed a much earlier origin for remote manipulators.<ref name=\"CMK\">{{Citation | last=Heinlein | first=Robert A. | author-link=Robert A.
