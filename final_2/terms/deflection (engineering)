It may refer to an angle or a distance.\n\nThe deflection distance of a member under a load is directly related to the slope of the deflected shape of the member under that load and can be calculated by integrating the function that mathematically describes the slope of the member under that load. Deflection can be calculated by standard formula (will only give the deflection of common [[Beam (structure)|beam]] configurations and load cases at discrete locations), or by methods such as [[virtual work]], [[Direct integration of a beam|direct integration]], [[Castigliano's method]], [[Macaulay's method]] or the [[direct stiffness method]], amongst others. The deflection of beam elements is usually calculated on the basis of the [[Euler\u2013Bernoulli beam equation]] while that of a plate or shell element is calculated using [[plate theory|plate or shell]] theory.\n\nAn example of the use of deflection in this context is in building construction. [[Architect]]s and [[engineer]]s select materials for various applications. The [[Beam (structure)|beams]] used for frame work are selected on the basis of deflection, amongst other factors.\n\n== Beam deflection for various loads and supports ==\nBeams can vary greatly in their geometry and composition. For instance, a beam may be straight or curved. It may be of constant cross section, or it may taper. It may be made entirely of the same material (homogeneous), or it may be composed of different materials (composite). Some of these things make analysis difficult, but many engineering applications involve cases that are not so complicated. Analysis is simplified if:\n\n:-The beam is originally straight, and any taper is slight\n:-The beam experiences only [[Hooke's law#General application to elastic materials|linear elastic]] deformation\n:-The beam is slender (its length to height ratio is greater than 10)\n:-Only small deflections are considered (max deflection less than 1/10 the [[Span (architecture)|span]]).\n\nIn this case, the equation governing the beam's deflection (<math>w</math>) can be approximated as:\n\n:<math>\\cfrac{\\mathrm{d}^2 w(x)}{\\mathrm{d} x^2}=\\frac{M(x)}{E(x) I(x)}</math>\nwhere the second derivative of its deflected shape with respect to <math>x</math> is interpreted as its curvature, <math>E</math> is the [[Young's modulus]], <math>I</math> is the [[area moment of inertia]] of the cross-section, and <math>M</math> is the internal [[bending]] moment in the beam.\n\nIf, in addition, the beam is not tapered and is [[homogeneous]], and is acted upon by a distributed load <math>q</math>, the above expression [[Bending#Quasistatic bending of beams| can be written as]]:\n\n:<math>\nEI~\\cfrac{\\mathrm{d}^4 w(x)}{\\mathrm{d} x^4} = q(x)\n</math>\n\nThis equation can be solved for a variety of loading and boundary conditions. A number of simple examples are shown below. The formulas expressed are approximations developed for long, slender, homogeneous, prismatic beams with small deflections, and linear elastic properties. Under these restrictions, the approximations should give results within 5% of the actual deflection.\n\n=== Cantilever beams ===\n\nCantilever beams have one end fixed, so that the slope and deflection at that end must be zero. \n[[File:Cantilever beam deflection.svg|thumb|Schematic of the deflection of a cantilever beam.]]\n\n==== End-loaded cantilever beams ====\n[[File:Cantilever with end load.svg|thumb|Cantilever beam with a force on the free end]]\nThe [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] deflection <math>\\delta</math> and [[angle]] of deflection <math>\\phi</math> (in [[radian]]s) at the free end in the example image: A (weightless) [[cantilever]] beam, with an end load, can be calculated (at the free end B) using:<ref name='gere'>{{Cite book|title=Mechanics of Materials |edition=Eighth| isbn = 978-1-111-57773-5|last1=Gere|first1= James M.|last2=Goodno|first2=Barry J.|pages=1083\u20131087}}</ref>\n\n: <math>\\delta_B = \\frac {F L^3} {3 E I}</math>\n\n: <math>\\phi_B = \\frac {F L^2} {2 E I}</math>\n\nwhere\n: <math>F</math> = [[Force]] acting on the tip of the beam\n: <math>L</math> = Length of the beam (span)\n: <math>E</math> = [[Modulus of elasticity]]\n: <math>I</math> = [[Area moment of inertia]] of the beam's cross section\n\nNote that if the span doubles, the deflection increases eightfold.

Most calculations will be made in SI or US customary units, although there are many other systems of units.\n\n=== International system (SI) ===\n:Force: newtons (<math>N</math>)\n\nLength: meters (<math>m</math>)\n:Modulus of elasticity: <math>\\frac{N}{m^2} (Pa)</math>\n:Moment of inertia: <math>m^4</math>\n\n=== US customary units (US) ===\n:Force: pounds force (<math>lb_f</math>)\n:Length: inches (<math>in</math>)\n:Modulus of elasticity: <math>\\frac{lb_f}{in^2}</math>\n:Moment of inertia: <math>in^4</math>\n\n=== Others ===\nOther units may be used as well, as long as they are self-consistent. For example, sometimes the kilogram force (<math>kg_f</math>) unit is used to measure loads. In such a case, the modulus of elasticity must be converted to <math>\\frac{kg_f}{m^2}</math>.\n\n== Structural deflection ==\n[[Building code]]s determine the maximum deflection, usually as a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] of the span e.g. 1/400 or 1/600. Either the strength limit state (allowable stress) or the serviceability limit state (deflection considerations amongst others) may govern the minimum dimensions of the member required.\n\nThe deflection must be considered for the purpose of the structure. When designing a [[steel frame]] to hold a glazed panel, one allows only minimal deflection to prevent  [[fracture]] of the glass.\n\nThe deflected shape of a beam can be represented by the [[Bending moment|moment]] diagram, integrated (twice, rotated and translated to enforce support conditions).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Slope deflection method]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.engineersedge.com/beam_calc_menu.shtml Deflection & stress of beams Calculators]\n*[http://www.mathalino.com/reviewer/mechanics-and-strength-of-materials/chapter-6-beam-deflections Deflection of beams]\n*[http://civilengineer.webinfolist.com/str/sdcalc.htm Online Calculator for Deflection and slope of beams]\n*[http://www.clag.org.uk/beam.html Beam Deflections]\n*[http://www.advancepipeliner.com/Resources/Others/Beams/Beam_Deflection_Formulae.pdf Beam Deflections (Tabulated)]\n\n[[Category:Engineering mechanics]]\n\n[[fr:D\u00e9flexion]]"}]}}}}
