It has been represented by the Greek letter \"{{pi}}\" since the mid-18th century, though it is also sometimes spelled out as \"'''pi'''\" ({{IPAc-en|p|a\u026a}}).\n\nBeing an [[irrational number]], {{pi}} cannot be expressed exactly as a [[common fraction|fraction]] (equivalently, its [[decimal representation]] never ends and never [[repeating decimal|settles into a permanent repeating pattern]]). Still, fractions such as 22/7 and other rational numbers are commonly used to [[Approximations of \u03c0|approximate]] {{pi}}. The digits appear to be [[random sequence|randomly distributed]].  In particular, the digit sequence of {{pi}} is conjectured to satisfy a [[normal number|specific kind of statistical randomness]], but to date no proof of this has been discovered. Also, {{pi}} is a [[transcendental number]]&nbsp;\u2013 a number that is not the [[Root of a polynomial|root]] of any non-zero [[polynomial]] having [[Rational number|rational]] [[coefficient]]s. This transcendence of {{pi}} implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of [[squaring the circle]] with a [[Compass-and-straightedge construction|compass and straightedge]].\n\nAncient civilizations needed the value of {{pi}} to be computed accurately for practical reasons.  It was calculated to seven digits, using geometrical techniques, in [[History of mathematics#Chinese mathematics|Chinese mathematics]] and to about five in [[History of mathematics#Indian mathematics|Indian mathematics]] in the 5th century AD. The historically first exact formula for {{pi}}, based on [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]], was not available until a millennium later, when in the 14th century the [[Leibniz formula for pi|Madhava\u2013Leibniz series]] was discovered in Indian mathematics.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Special Functions|last=George E.

Because of its special role as an [[eigenvalue]], {{pi}} appears in areas of mathematics and the sciences having little to do with the geometry of circles, such as [[number theory]] and [[statistics]].  It is also found in  [[cosmology]], [[thermodynamics]], [[mechanics]] and [[electromagnetism]]. The ubiquity of {{pi}} makes it one of the most widely known mathematical constants both inside and outside the scientific community: Several books devoted to it have been published, the number is celebrated on [[Pi Day]] and record-setting calculations of the digits of {{pi}} often result in news headlines.

For example, if a circle has twice the diameter of another circle it will also have twice the circumference, preserving the ratio {{math|''C''/''d''}}. This definition of {{pi}} implicitly makes use of [[Euclidean geometry|flat (Euclidean) geometry]]; although the notion of a circle can be extended to any [[Non-Euclidean geometry|curved (non-Euclidean) geometry]], these new circles will no longer satisfy the formula {{math|{{pi}} {{=}} ''C''/''d''}}.<ref name=\"Arndt\" />\n\nHere, the circumference of a circle is the [[arc length]] around the perimeter of the circle, a quantity which can be formally defined independently of geometry using [[limit (mathematics)|limit]]s, a concept in [[calculus]].<ref>{{citation|author=[[Tom Apostol]]|title=Calculus, volume 1|publisher=Wiley|edition=2nd|year=1967}}.

One such definition, due to [[Richard Baltzer]],<ref>{{citation|author=Richard Baltzer|title=Die Elemente der Mathematik|year=1870|page=195|url=https://archive.org/details/dieelementederm02baltgoog|publisher=Hirzel}}</ref> and popularized by [[Edmund Landau]],<ref>{{citation|author=Edmund Landau|title=Einf\u00fchrung in die Differentialrechnung und Integralrechnung|publisher=Noordoff|year=1934|page=193}}</ref> is the following: {{pi}} is twice the smallest positive number at which the [[cosine|cosine function]] equals 0.<ref name=\"Arndt\" /><ref name=\"Reinhold Remmert 1991 129\"/><ref name=\"Rudin 1976\">{{cite book|last=Rudin|first=Walter|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=0-07-054235-X|ref=harv}}, p 183.</ref>  The cosine can be defined independently of geometry as a [[power series]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Rudin|first=Walter|title=Real and complex analysis|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1986|ref=harv}}, p 2.</ref> or as the solution of a [[differential equation]].<ref name=\"Rudin 1976\"/>\n\nIn a similar spirit, {{pi}} can be defined instead using properties of the [[complex exponential]], {{math|exp(''z'')}}, of a [[complex number|complex]] variable {{math|''z''}}.  Like the cosine, the complex exponential can be defined in one of several ways.  The set of complex numbers at which {{math|exp(''z'')}} is equal to one is then an (imaginary) arithmetic progression of the form:\n:<math>\\{\\dots,-2\\pi i, 0, 2\\pi i, 4\\pi i,\\dots\\} = \\{2\\pi ki\\mid k\\in\\mathbb Z\\}</math>\nand there is a unique positive real number {{pi}} with this property.<ref name=\"Reinhold Remmert 1991 129\"/><ref>{{citation|author=[[Lars Ahlfors]]|title=Complex analysis|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1966|p=46}}</ref>\nA more abstract variation on the same idea, making use of sophisticated mathematical concepts of [[topology]] and [[algebra]], is the following theorem:<ref>{{citation|author=[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]|title=Topologie generale|publisher=Springer|year=1981}}, \u00a7VIII.2</ref> there is a unique [[continuous function|continuous]] [[isomorphism]] from the [[group (mathematics)|group]] '''R'''/'''Z''' of real numbers under addition [[quotient group|modulo]] integers (the [[circle group]]) onto the multiplicative group of [[complex numbers]] of [[absolute value]] one.

Thus the number {{pi}} is also characterized as the best constant in the [[isoperimetric inequality]] (times one-fourth).

First, the discovery of new [[iterative algorithm]]s for computing {{pi}}, which were much faster than the infinite series; and second, the invention of [[Multiplication algorithm#Fast multiplication algorithms for large inputs|fast multiplication algorithms]] that could multiply large numbers very rapidly.<ref>{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=15\u201317}}</ref> Such algorithms are particularly important in modern {{pi}} computations, because most of the computer's time is devoted to multiplication.<ref>{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=131}}</ref> They include the [[Karatsuba algorithm]], [[Toom\u2013Cook multiplication]], and [[FFT multiplication#Fourier transform methods|Fourier transform-based methods]].<ref>{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=132, 140}}</ref>\n\nThe iterative algorithms were independently published in 1975\u20131976 by American physicist [[Eugene Salamin (mathematician)|Eugene Salamin]] and Australian scientist [[Richard Brent (scientist)|Richard Brent]].<ref name=\"Arndt_j\">{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|p=87}}</ref> These avoid reliance on infinite series. An iterative algorithm repeats a specific calculation, each iteration using the outputs from prior steps as its inputs, and produces a result in each step that converges to the desired value.

For example, the Brent-Salamin algorithm doubles the number of digits in each iteration. In 1984, the Canadian brothers [[Jonathan Borwein|John]] and [[Peter Borwein]] produced an iterative algorithm that quadruples the number of digits in each step; and in 1987, one that increases the number of digits five times in each step.<ref>{{harvnb|Arndt|Haenel|2006|pp=111 (5 times); pp. 113\u2013114 (4 times)}}.<br />See {{harvnb|Borwein|Borwein|1987}} for details of algorithms.</ref> Iterative methods were used by Japanese mathematician [[Yasumasa Kanada]] to set several records for computing {{pi}} between 1995 and 2002.<ref name=\"Background\" /> This rapid convergence comes at a price: the iterative algorithms require significantly more memory than infinite series.<ref name=\"Background\">{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=David H.|url=http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/dhbpapers/dhb-kanada.pdf|title=Some Background on Kanada\u2019s Recent Pi Calculation|date=16 May 2003|accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Motivations for computing {{pi}}===\n[[File:Record pi approximations.svg|thumb|400px|right|As mathematicians discovered new algorithms, and computers became available, the number of known decimal digits of {{pi}} increased dramatically.
