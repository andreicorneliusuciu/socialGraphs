Instead of guiding behavior by symbolic [[mental representation]]s of the world, subsumption architecture couples sensory information to [[action selection]] in an intimate and [[top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] fashion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Arkin|first=Ronald|title=Behavior-Based Robotics|year=1998|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-01165-4|page=130}}</ref>\n\nIt does this by decomposing the complete behavior into sub-behaviors.  These sub-behaviors are organized into a hierarchy of layers. Each layer implements a particular level of behavioral competence, and higher levels are able to subsume lower levels in order to create viable behavior.  For example, a robot's lowest layer could be \"avoid an object\". The second layer would be \"wander around\", which runs beneath the third layer \"explore the world\".  Because a robot must have the ability to \"avoid objects\" in order to \"wander around\" effectively, the subsumption architecture creates a system in which the higher layers utilize the lower-level competencies.  The layers, which all receive sensor-information, work in parallel and generate outputs.  These outputs can be commands to actuators, or signals that suppress or inhibit other layers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Rodney|title=Cambrian Intelligence: The Early History of the New AI|year=1999|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-02468-3|pages=8\u201312;15\u201316}}</ref>\n\n==The Goal of the Architecture==\nSubsumption architecture attacks the problem of intelligence from a significantly different perspective than traditional AI.  Disappointed with the performance of [[Shakey the robot]] and similar representation-inspired projects, [[Rodney Brooks]] started creating robots based on a different notion of intelligence.  Instead of modelling aspects of human intelligence via symbol manipulation, this approach is aimed at [[real-time computing|real-time]] interaction and viable responses to a dynamic lab or office environment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Arkin|first=Ronald|title=Behavior-Based Robotics|year=1998|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-01165-4|pages=130\u2013131}}</ref>\n\nThe goal was informed by four key ideas:\n*Situatedness\u2013 A major idea of [[situated AI]] is that a robot should be able to react to its environment within a human-like time-frame.  Brooks argues that situated mobile robot should not represent the world via an internal set of symbols and then act on this model.  Instead, he claims that \"the world is its own best model,\" which means that proper perception-to-action setups can be used to directly interact with the world as opposed to modelling it.\n*Embodiment\u2013 Brooks argues building an [[embodied agent]] accomplishes two things. The first is that it forces the designer to test and create an integrated physical [[control system]], not theoretic models or simulated robots that might not work in the physical world.  The second is that it can solve the [[symbol grounding]] problem, a philosophical issue many traditional AIs encounter, by directly coupling sense-data to meaningful actions.  \"The world grounds regress,\" and the internal relation of the behavioral layers are directly grounded in the world the robot perceives.\n*Intelligence\u2013 Looking at evolutionary progress, Brooks argues that developing perceptual and mobility skills are a necessary foundation for human-like intelligence.  Also, by rejecting [[top-down and bottom-up design|top-down]] representations as a viable starting point for AI, it seems that \"intelligence is determined by the dynamics of interaction with the world.\"\n*[[Emergence]]\u2013 Conventionally, individual modules are not considered intelligent by themselves. It is the interaction of such modules, evaluated by observing the agent and its environment, that is usually deemed intelligent (or not).  \"Intelligence,\" therefore, \"is in the eye of the observer.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Rodney|title=Cambrian Intelligence: The Early History of the New AI|year=1999|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-02468-3|pages=165\u2013170}}</ref>\n\nThe ideas outlined above are still a part of an ongoing debate regarding the nature of intelligence and how the progress of robotics and AI should be fostered.\n\n==Layers and Augmented Finite-State Machines==\nEach layer is made up by a set of processors that are augmented [[finite-state machine]]s (AFSM), the augmentation being added [[instance variable]]s to hold programmable data-structures.  A layer is a [[module]] and is responsible for a single behavioral goal, such as \"wander around.\"  There is no central control within or between these behavioral modules.  All AFSMs continuously and asynchronously receive input from the relevant sensors and send output to actuators (or other AFSMs).  Input signals that are not read by the time a new one is delivered end up getting discarded.  These discarded signals are common, and is useful for performance because it allows the system to work in real time by dealing with the most immediate information.\n\nBecause there is no central control, AFSMs communicate with each other via inhibition and suppression signals.  Inhibition signals block signals from reaching actuators or AFSMs, and suppression signals blocks or replaces the inputs to layers or their AFSMs. This system of AFSM communication is how higher layers subsume lower ones (see figure 1), as well as how the architecture deals with priority and [[action selection]] arbitration in general.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Rodney|title=Cambrian Intelligence: The Early History of the New AI|year=1999|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-02468-3|pages=12\u201316}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Subsumption Architecture Abstract Diagram.png|thumb|Figure 1: Abstract representation of subsumption architecture, with the higher level layers subsuming the roles of lower level layers when the sensory information determines it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Rodney|title=Cambrian Intelligence: The Early History of the New AI|year=1999|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-02468-3|page=11}}</ref>]]\n\nThe development of layers follows an intuitive progression.  First the lowest layer is created, tested, and debugged.  Once that lowest level is running, one creates and attaches the second layer with the proper suppression and inhibition connections to the first layer.  After testing and debugging the combined behavior, this process can be repeated for (theoretically) any number of behavioral modules.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Rodney|title=Cambrian Intelligence: The Early History of the New AI|year=1999|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-02468-3|pages=16\u201320}}</ref>\n\n==Subsumption Robots==\nThe following is a small list of robots that utilize the subsumption architecture.\n\n*[[Allen (robot)]]\n*Herbert, a soda can collecting robot (see external links for a video)\n*Genghis, a robust hexapodal walker (see external links for a video)\n\nThe above are described in detail along with other robots in ''Elephants Don't Play Chess.''<ref>name=Brooks1990 {{cite journal\n | author = Brooks, R.A.\n | year = 1990\n | title = Elephants Don't Play Chess\n | journal = Designing Autonomous Agents: Theory and Practice from Biology to Engineering and Back\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=cK-1pavJW98C&pg=PA3-IA4&dq=Elephants+Don%27t+Play+Chess\n | accessdate = 2013-11-23\n | publisher = [[MIT Press]]\n | isbn = 978-0-262-63135-8\n}}</ref>\n\n==Strengths and Weaknesses of the Architecture==\n\nThe main advantages of the architecture are:\n*the emphasis on iterative development & testing of [[real-time computing|real-time]] systems in their target domain;\n*the emphasis on connecting limited, task-specific perception directly to the expressed actions that require it; and\n*the emphasis on distributive and parallel control, thereby integrating the perception, control, and action systems in a manner similar to animals.<ref>name=Brooks1990 {{cite journal\n | author = Brooks, R.A.\n | year = 1990\n | title = Elephants Don't Play Chess\n | journal = Designing Autonomous Agents: Theory and Practice from Biology to Engineering and Back\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=cK-1pavJW98C&pg=PA3-IA4&dq=Elephants+Don%27t+Play+Chess\n | accessdate = 2008-04-06\n | publisher = MIT Press\n | isbn = 978-0-262-63135-8\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Rodney|title=Cambrian Intelligence: The Early History of the New AI|year=1999|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-02468-3|pages=172\u2013173}}</ref>\n\nThe main disadvantages of the architecture are:\n*the difficulty of designing adaptable [[action selection]] through highly distributed system of inhibition and suppression;<ref>{{cite book|last=Arkin|first=Ronald|title=Behavior-Based Robotics|year=1998|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-01165-4|pages=139\u2013140}}</ref> and\n*the lack of large memory and symbolic representation, which seems to restrict the architecture from understanding language;\n\nWhen subsumption architecture was developed, the novel setup and approach of subsumption architecture allowed it to be successful in many important domains where traditional AI had failed, namely [[real-time computing|real-time]] interaction with a dynamic environment.
