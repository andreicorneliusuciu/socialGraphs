The aerodynamics of the canard configuration are complex and require careful analysis.\n\nRather than use the conventional [[Tailplane|tailplane configuration]] found on most aircraft, an aircraft designer may adopt the canard configuration to reduce the main wing loading, to better control the main wing airflow, or to increase the aircraft\u2019s maneuverability, especially at high [[Angle of attack|angles of attack]] or during a [[Stall (fluid mechanics)|stall]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} Canard foreplanes, whether used in a canard or [[Three-surface aircraft|three-surface]] configuration, have important consequences on the aircraft\u2019s longitudinal equilibrium, static and dynamic stability characteristics.\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Santos - Nov12 1906 xcerpt.JPG|thumb|The 1906 [[Santos-Dumont 14-bis]]]]\nThe term \u201ccanard\u201d arose from the appearance of the [[Santos-Dumont 14-bis]] of 1906, which was said to be reminiscent of a [[duck]] (''canard'' in French) with its neck stretched out in flight.<ref name=\"c\">{{cite book| last= Villard| first= Henry Serrano| title= Contact! : the story of the early aviators|year=2002|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, NY |isbn=0-486-42327-1|pages = 39\u201353 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tDmR7DhM_uEC&lpg=PA40}}</ref>{{Sfn | Burns | 1983}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kitty hawk gross.jpg|thumb|The [[Wright Flyer]] of 1903 was a canard biplane]]\n\n===Pioneer years===\n\nThe [[Wright Brothers]] began experimenting with the foreplane configuration around 1900. Their first kite included a front surface for pitch control and they adopted this configuration for their first [[Wright Flyer|Flyer]]. They were suspicious of the aft tail because [[Otto Lilienthal]] had been killed in a glider with one. The Wrights realised that a foreplane would tend to destabilise an aeroplane but expected it to be a better control surface, in addition to being visible to the pilot in flight.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://authors.library.caltech.edu/11239/1/CULaiaaj03.pdf|title = The Wright Brothers: First Aeronautical Engineers and Test Pilots|last = Culick|first = F.E.C.|date = 2003|journal = AIAA Journal|doi = 10.2514/2.2046|pmid = |access-date = 2015-08-08|bibcode = 2003AIAAJ..41..985C }}</ref> They believed it impossible to provide both control and stability in a single design, and opted for control.\n\nMany pioneers initially followed the Wrights' lead. For example, the [[Santos-Dumont 14-bis]] aeroplane of 1906 had no \"tail\", but a [[box kite]]-like set of control surfaces in the front, pivoting on a [[universal joint]] on the fuselage's extreme nose, making it capable of incorporating both yaw and pitch control. The [[Fabre Hydravion]] of 1910 was the first floatplane to fly and had a foreplane.\n\nBut canard behaviour was not properly understood and other European pioneers\u2014among them, [[Louis Bl\u00e9riot]]\u2014were establishing the tailplane as the safer and more \"conventional\" design. Some, including the Wrights, experimented with both fore and aft planes on the same aircraft, now known as the [[three surface aircraft|three surface]] configuration.\n\nAfter 1911, few canard types would be produced for many decades. In 1914 W.E. Evans commented that \"the Canard type model has practically received its death-blow so far as scientific models are concerned.\"<ref>{{Citation | title = Flight | date = 14 March 1914 | page = 286 | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1914/1914%20-%200286.html | publisher = Flight global}}.</ref>\n\n===1914 to 1945===\n[[File:Curtiss XP-55 Ascender in flight 061024-F-1234P-007.jpg|thumb| [[Curtiss-Wright XP-55 Ascender]] ]]\nExperiments continued sporadically for several decades.\n\nIn 1917 de Bruy\u00e8re constructed his [[De Bruy\u00e8re C 1|C1]] biplane fighter, having a canard foreplane and rear-mounted pusher propellor. The C.1 was a failure.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Green | first1 = W | last2 = Swanborough | first2 = G | title = The complete book of fighters | publisher = Salamander | year = 1994 | page = 163}}.</ref> <!-- Saved this bit for moving to a new article when created: The C.1 featured a single (monoplane) canard foreplane with both dorsal and ventral tail fins behind which was the rear-mounted pusher propellor.

The C.1 rolled over and crashed on its first flight. -->\n\nFirst flown in 1927, the experimental [[Focke-Wulf F 19]] \"Ente\" (duck) was more successful.  Two examples were built and one of them continued flying until 1931.\n\nImmediately before and during World War II several experimental canard fighters were flown, including the [[Ambrosini SS.4]], [[Curtiss-Wright XP-55 Ascender]] and [[Kyushu J7W|Ky\u016bsh\u016b J7W1 ''Shinden'']]. These were attempts at using the canard configuration to give advantages in areas such as performance, armament disposition or pilot view, but no production aircraft were completed. The Shinden was ordered into production \"off the drawing board\" but hostilities ceased before any other than prototypes had flown.\n\nJust after the end of World War II in Europe in 1945, what may have been the first canard designed and flown in the [[Soviet Union]] appeared as a test aircraft, the lightweight [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-8]] ''Utka'' (Russian for \"duck\"). It was reportedly a favorite among MiG OKB test pilots for its docile, slow-speed handling characteristics and flew for some years, being used as a testbed during development of the swept wing of the (conventional layout) [[MiG-15]] jet fighter.\n\n===The canard revival===\n[[File:North American XB-70 above runway ECN-792.jpg|thumb|[[XB-70 Valkyrie]] experimental bomber]]\n\nWith the arrival of the [[jet age]] and supersonic flight, American designers, notably [[North American Aviation]], began to experiment with supersonic canard delta designs, with some such as the [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie]] and the Soviet equivalent [[Sukhoi T-4]] flying in prototype form. But the stability and control problems encountered prevented widespread adoption.<ref name=\"saab\" />\n\nIn 1963 the Swedish company Saab patented a delta-winged design which overcame the earlier problems, in what has become known as the close-coupled canard.<ref name=\"saab\">''Delta wing canard aircraft'', US Patent [https://google.com/patents/US3188022 US3188022 A].</ref><ref name=\"anderson21\">Anderson, S.B.; [http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19870013196.pdf A Look at Handling Qualities of Canard Configurations], NASA Technical Memorimdum 88354, 1986, page 21.</ref> It was built as the [[Saab 37 Viggen]] and in 1967 became the first modern canard aircraft to enter production. The success of this aircraft spurred many designers, and canard surfaces sprouted on a number of types derived from the popular [[Dassault Mirage]] delta-winged jet fighter. These included variants of the French [[Dassault Mirage III]], Israeli [[IAI Kfir]] and South African [[Atlas Cheetah]]. The close-coupled canard delta remains a popular configuration for combat aircraft.\n\nThe Viggen also inspired the American [[Burt Rutan]] to create a two-seater homebuilt canard delta design, accordingly named [[Rutan VariViggen|VariViggen]] and flown in 1972. Rutan then abandoned the delta wing as unsuited to such light aircraft. His next two canard designs, the [[Rutan VariEze|VariEze]] and [[Rutan Long-EZ|Long-EZ]] had longer-span swept wings. These designs were not only successful and built in large numbers but were radically different from anything seen before.<ref>{{Citation | first = Daroll | last = Stinton | title = The design of the aeroplane | quote = Rutan canards wrought a change in thinking which might have a profound influence in future}}.</ref> Rutan's ideas soon spread to other designers. From the 1980s they found favour in the executive market with the appearance of types such as the [[OMAC Laser 300]], [[Avtek 400]] and [[Beechcraft Starship|Beech Starship]].\n\n===Computer control===\n[[File:Gripen - RIAT 2009 (3793317200).jpg|thumb|Canards visible on a [[JAS 39 Gripen]]]]\nStatic canard designs can have complex interactions in airflow between the canard and the main wing, leading to issues with stability and behaviour in the stall.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} This limits their applicability. The development of fly-by-wire and artificial stability towards the end of the century opened the way for computerized controls to begin turning these complex effects from stability concerns into maneuverability advantages.<ref name=Canards />\n\nThis approach produced a new generation of military canard designs.  The [[Saab JAS 39 Gripen]] multirole fighter flew in 1988 and was adopted by a number of national air forces. Others followed. Types which would follow it into operational service included the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] in 1994 and the Chinese [[Chengdu J-10]] in 1998.\n\n==Basic design principles ==\nA canard foreplane may be used for various reasons such as lift, (in)stability, trim, flight control, or to modify airflow over the main wing.  Design analysis has been divided into two main classes, for the lifting-canard and the control-canard.<ref name=raymer1999>{{cite book|last1=Raymer|first1=Daniel P.|title=Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach|date=1999|publisher=AIAA|isbn=1-56347-281-3|edition=3}}</ref>{{rp|81}} These classes may follow the close-coupled type or not, and a given design may provide either or both of lift and control.\n\n===Lift===\n[[File:rutan.long-EZ.g-wily.arp.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rutan Long-EZ]], with high-aspect-ratio lifting canard and suspended luggage pods]]\nIn the lifting-canard configuration, the weight of the aircraft is shared between the wing and the canard. It has been described as an extreme conventional configuration but with a small highly loaded wing and an enormous lifting tail which enables the centre of mass to be very far aft relative to the front surface.<ref name=Drela>{{Citation | url = http://www.rcuniverse.com/forum/m_3441894/mpage_2/printable.htm | title = Canard description | first = Mark, Aero-astro professor, MIT | last = Drela | publisher = RC universe | type = forum}}.</ref>\n\nA lifting canard generates an upload, in contrast to a conventional aft-tail which sometimes generates negative lift that must be counteracted by extra lift on the main wing. As the canard lift adds to the overall lift capability of the aircraft, this may appear to favor the canard layout. In particular, at takeoff the wing is most heavily loaded and where a conventional tail exerts a downforce worsening the load, a canard exerts an upward force relieving the load. This allows a smaller main wing.\n  \nHowever, the foreplane also creates a [[downwash]] which can affect the wing lift distribution unfavorably, so the differences in overall lift and [[Lift-induced drag|induced drag]] are not obvious and they depend on the details of the design.<ref name= Canards /><ref name= Drela/><ref name= CanardProCon>{{Citation | url = http://docs.desktop.aero/appliedaero/configuration/canardProCon.html | publisher = Desktop Aero | title = A Summary of Canard Advantages and Disadvantages}}.</ref>\n\nA danger associated with an insufficiently loaded canard\u2014i.e. when the center of gravity is too far aft\u2014is that when approaching [[stall (flight)|stall]], the main wing may stall first. This causes the rear of the craft to drop, deepening the stall and sometimes preventing recovery.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Nasa | id = TM 88354 | title = A look at handling qualities of canard configurations | chapter = VariEze | page = 15 | quote = With a rearward CG position, a high AoA trim (deep stall) condition may occur from which recovery may be impossible}}</ref>  To ensure safe pitch stability in the stall, the canard must stall first{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}, so the wing must always stay below its maximum lift capability.  Hence, the wing must be larger than otherwise necessary, reducing or even reversing the reduction in size enabled by the canard lift.<ref name=Canards /><ref name = CanardProCon />{{vn|date=December 2015}}\n\nWith a lifting-canard type, the main wing must be located further aft of the center of gravity than a conventional wing, and this increases the downward pitching moment caused by the deflection of [[Flap (aircraft)|trailing-edge flaps]]. Highly loaded canards do not have sufficient extra lift available to balance this moment, so lifting-canard aircraft cannot readily be designed with powerful trailing-edge flaps.<ref name=raymer1999/>\n\n===Control===\n[[File:RAF Eurofighter Typhoon cockpit.jpg|thumb|The control canard on an [[RAF]] [[Eurofighter Typhoon|Typhoon]] in flight]]\nPitch control in a canard type may be achieved either by the canard surface, as on the control-canard or in the same way as a [[tailless aircraft]], by control surfaces at the rear of the main wing, as on the Saab Viggen.\n\nIn a control-canard design, most of the weight of the aircraft is carried by the wing and the canard is used primarily for pitch control during maneuvering. A pure control-canard operates only as a control surface and is nominally at zero [[angle of attack]] and carrying no load in normal flight. Modern combat aircraft of canard configuration typically have a control-canard driven by a [[Fly-by-wire|computerized flight control system]].<ref name=raymer1999/>\n\nCanards with little or no loading (i.e. control-canards) may be used to intentionally destabilize some combat aircraft in order to make them more manoeuvrable. The electronic flight control system uses the pitch control function of the canard foreplane to create artificial static and dynamic stability.<ref name=Canards>{{Harvnb | Neblett | Metheny | Leifsson | 2003}}.</ref><ref name =CanardProCon />\n\nA benefit obtainable from a control-canard is the correction of [[pitch-up]] during a wingtip stall.  An all-moving canard capable of a significant nose-down deflection can be used to counteract the pitch-up due to the tip stall.  As a result, the [[aspect ratio]] and sweep of the wing can be optimized without having to guard against pitch-up.<ref name=raymer1999/> A highly loaded lifting canard does not have sufficient spare lift capacity to provide this protection.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Stability===\n[[File:PterodactylAscenderII-B202.jpg|thumb|[[Pterodactyl Ascender II+2]] with stabilizing canard]]\n\nA canard foreplane may be used as a [[horizontal stabiliser]], whether stability is achieved statically<ref>Garrison (2002), page 85; \"the stabilizer in the front...

This is the function of the stabilizer.\"</ref> To achieve this stability, the change in canard [[lift coefficient]] with [[angle of attack]] (lift coefficient slope) should be less than that for the main plane.<ref name = \"Sherwin\">{{Citation | last = Sherwin | first = Keith | title = Man powered flight | edition = rev reprint | page = 131 | publisher = Model & Allied Publications | year = 1975 | ISBN = 0-85242-436-1}}.</ref> A number of factors affect this characteristic.<ref name=raymer1999/>\n\nFor most [[airfoil]]s, lift slope decreases at high lift coefficients. Therefore, the most common way in which pitch stability can be achieved is to increase the lift coefficient (so the wing loading) of the canard. This tends to increase the [[Induced drag|lift-induced drag]] of the foreplane, which may be given a high [[Aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] in order to limit drag.<ref name=Sherwin/> Such a canard airfoil has a greater airfoil [[camber (aerodynamics)|camber]] than the wing.\n\nAnother possibility is to decrease the aspect ratio of the canard,<ref>{{Citation | last = Hoerner | title = Fluid Dynamic Lift | pages = 11\u201330 | chapter = Aspect ratio}}.</ref> with again more lift-induced drag and possibly a higher [[Stall (flight)|stall]] angle than the wing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nA design approach used by [[Burt Rutan]] is a high aspect ratio canard with higher lift coefficient (the wing loading of the canard is between 1.6 and 2 times the wing one) and a canard airfoil whose lift coefficient slope is non-linear (nearly flat) between 14\u00b0 and 24\u00b0.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Citation | publisher = Nasa | id = TP 2382 | title = VariEze Wind Tunnel Investigation}}.</ref>\n\nAnother stabilisation parameter is the power effect. In case of canard [[pusher propeller]]: \"the power-induced flow clean up of the wing trailing edge\" <ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> increases the wing lift coefficient slope (see above). Conversely, a propeller located ahead of the canard (increasing the lift slope of the canard) has a strong destabilising effect.<ref>{{Citation | title = Tandem aircraft PAT-1 | publisher = Nasa | id = TM 88354}}.</ref>\n\n===Trim===\nA highly loaded lifting canard may not have sufficient spare lifting capacity to accommodate large movements of the centre of pressure or of the centre of gravity. Trim may be accomplished in similar manner to a tailless craft, by adjustment of trailing-edge surfaces.\n\nIn particular, the use of landing flaps on the main wing causes a large trim change. The Saab Viggen has flaps on the canard surface which were deployed simultaneously to cancel out the change in trim. The Beech Starship uses variable-sweep foreplanes to trim the position of the lift force.\n\nWhen the main wing is most loaded, at takeoff, to rotate the nose up a conventional tailplane typically pushes down while a foreplane lifts up. In order to maintain trim the main wing on a canard design must therefore be located further aft relative to the centre of gravity than on the equivalent conventional design.\n\n==Variations==\n\n===Close coupling===\n[[File:Rafale (7986533137).jpg|thumb|[[Dassault Rafale|A Dassault Rafale]] in high angle-of-attack flight]]\nIn the close-coupled delta wing canard, the foreplane is located just above and forward of the wing. The vortices generated by a delta-shaped foreplane flow back past the main wing and interact with its own vortices. Because these are critical for lift, a badly-placed foreplane can cause severe problems. By bringing the foreplane close to the wing and just above it in a close-coupled arrangement, the interactions can be made beneficial, actually helping to solve other problems too.<ref name=\"saab\" /> For example, at high angles of attack (and therefore typically at low speeds) the canard surface directs airflow downward over the wing, reducing turbulence which results in reduced drag and increased lift.<ref name=\"Sageaction\">{{cite web|url = http://www.sageaction.com/aircraft_testing1.htm#JetAircraft |title = Jet Aircraft \u2013 Effect of a close-coupled canard on a swept wing | type = Abstract | work = SAI Research Report | id = 7501 | accessdate = 2009-08-25| publisher = Sage Action |year = 2009}}</ref> Typically the foreplane creates a vortex which attaches to the upper surface of the wing, stabilising and re-energising the airflow over the wing and delaying or preventing the stall.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe canard foreplane may be fixed as on the [[IAI Kfir]], have landing flaps as on the [[Saab Viggen]], or be moveable and also act as a control-canard during normal flight as on the [[Dassault Rafale#Aerodynamics|Dassault Rafale]].\n\nA close-coupled canard has been shown to benefit a supersonic [[delta wing]] design which gains lift in both [[transonic]] flight (such as for [[supercruise]]) and also in low speed flight (such as take offs and landings).<ref name =\"NASA-TM-88354\">{{Citation | last = Anderson | first = Seth B | url = http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19870013196_1987013196.pdf | id = TM-88354 | title = A Look at Handling Qualities of Canard Configurations | page = 16 | publisher = [[NASA]] | date = 1 September 1986 | quote = Incorporating roll control on the canard is basically less efficient because of an adverse downwash influence on the main wing opposing the canard rolling-moment input.}}</ref>\n\n===Free-floating canard===\nA free-floating canard is designed to change its [[angle of incidence (aerodynamics)|angle of incidence]] to the fuselage without pilot input.
