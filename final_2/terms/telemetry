Systems that need external instructions and data to operate require the counterpart of telemetry, [[telecommand]].<ref>Mary Bellis, \"Telemetry\"</ref>\n\nAlthough the term commonly refers to [[wireless communications|wireless]] data transfer mechanisms (e.g., using [[radio]], ultrasonic, or [[Infrared#Communications|infrared]] systems), it also encompasses data transferred over other media such as a telephone or computer network, optical link or other wired communications like power line carriers. Many modern telemetry systems take advantage of the low cost and ubiquity of [[GSM]] networks by using [[SMS]] to receive and transmit telemetry data.\n\nA [[telemeter]] is a device used to remotely measure any quantity. It consists of a [[sensor]], a transmission path, and a display, recording, or control device. Telemeters are the physical devices used in telemetry. Electronic devices are widely used in telemetry and can be wireless or hard-wired, [[analog signal|analog]] or [[Digital data|digital]]. Other technologies are also possible, such as mechanical, hydraulic and optical.<ref>Bakshi ''et al.'', pages 8.1\u20138.3</ref>\n\nTelemetry may be [[commutation (telemetry)|commutated]] to allow the transmission of multiple data streams in a fixed [[frame (networking)|frame]].\n\n==History==\nTelemetering information over wire had its origins in the 19th century. One of the first data-transmission circuits was developed in 1845 between the [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian Tsar]]'s [[Winter Palace]] and army headquarters. In 1874, French engineers built a system of weather and snow-depth sensors on [[Mont Blanc]] that transmitted real-time information to [[Paris]]. In 1901 the American inventor C.&nbsp;Michalke patented the [[Synchro|selsyn]], a circuit for sending synchronized rotation information over a distance. In 1906 a set of seismic stations were built with telemetering to the Pulkovo Observatory in Russia.  In 1912, [[Commonwealth Edison]] developed a system of telemetry to monitor electrical loads on its power grid. The [[Panama Canal]] (completed 1913\u20131914) used extensive telemetry systems to monitor locks and water levels.<ref>Mayo-Wells, \"The Origins of Space Telemetry\", ''Technology and Culture'', 1963</ref>\n\nWireless telemetry made early appearances in the [[radiosonde]], developed concurrently in 1930 by Robert Bureau in France and [[Pavel Molchanov]] in [[Russia]].  Mochanov's system modulated temperature and pressure measurements by converting them to wireless [[Morse code]]. The German [[V-2]] rocket used a system of primitive multiplexed radio signals called \"Messina\" to report four rocket parameters, but it was so unreliable that [[Wernher von Braun]] once claimed it was more useful to watch the rocket through binoculars. In the US and the USSR, the Messina system was quickly replaced with better systems (in both cases, based on [[pulse-position modulation]]).<ref>Joachim & Muehlner, \"Trends in Missile and Space Radio Telemetry\" declassified Lockheed report</ref>\n\nEarly Soviet missile and space telemetry systems which were developed in the late 1940s used either pulse-position modulation (e.g., the Tral telemetry system developed by OKB-MEI) or [[pulse-duration modulation]] (e.g., the RTS-5 system developed by NII-885).  In the United States, early work employed similar systems, but were later replaced by [[pulse-code modulation]] (PCM) (for example, in the Mars probe [[Mariner&nbsp;4]]).  Later Soviet interplanetary probes used redundant radio systems, transmitting telemetry by PCM on a decimeter band and PPM on a centimeter band.<ref>Molotov, E. L., ''Nazemnye Radiotekhnicheskie Sistemy Upravleniya Kosmicheskiymi Apparatami''</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Meteorology===\nTelemetry has been used by weather balloons for transmitting meteorological data since 1920.\n\n===Oil and gas industry===\nTelemetry is used to transmit drilling mechanics and formation evaluation information uphole, in real time, as a well is drilled. These services are known as [[Measurement while drilling]] and [[Logging while drilling]]. Information acquired thousands of feet below ground, while drilling, is sent through the drilling hole to the surface sensors and the demodulation software. The pressure wave (sana) is translated into useful information after DSP and noise filters. This information is used for [[Formation evaluation]], [[Drilling Optimization]], and [[Geosteering]].\n\n===Motor racing===\nTelemetry is a key factor in modern motor racing, allowing race engineers to interpret data collected during a test or race and use it to properly tune the car for optimum performance.  Systems used in series such as [[Formula One]] have become advanced to the point where the potential lap time of the car can be calculated, and this time is what the driver is expected to meet. Examples of measurements on a race car include accelerations (G&nbsp;forces) in three axes, temperature readings, wheel speed, and suspension displacement.  In Formula One, driver input is also recorded so the team can assess driver performance and (in case of an accident) the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] can determine or rule out driver error as a possible cause.\n\nLater developments include two-way telemetry which allows engineers to update calibrations on the car in real time (even while it is out on the track). In Formula One, two-way telemetry surfaced in the early 1990s and consisted of a message display on the dashboard which the team could update. Its development continued until May 2001, when it was first allowed on the cars. By 2002, teams were able to change engine mapping and deactivate engine sensors from the pit while the car was on the track.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} For the 2003 season, the FIA banned two-way telemetry from Formula One;{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} however, the technology may be used in other types of racing or on road cars.\n\nTelemetry has also been applied in [[yacht racing]]{{Clarify|post-text=For what purpose? By whom?|date=March 2009}} on [[Oracle Racing]]'s [[USA 76 (America's Cup Class)|USA 76]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nOne way telemetry system has also been applied in [[Radio-controlled car|R/C racing car]] to get information by car's sensors like: engine RPM, voltage, temperatures, throttle.\n\n===Transportation===\nIn the transportation industry, telemetry provides meaningful information about the driver\u2019s performance by collecting data from the vehicle, leading to better fuel efficiency through driver feedback, which includes in-cab coaching.<ref>La t\u00e9l\u00e9m\u00e9trie v\u00e9hiculaire, une technologie incontournable. Bernard Gauthier, Transport Magazine. June 2014.</ref> Other benefits include fewer traffic violations and lower insurance cost for trucking companies.<ref>A little more monitor, please. Steve Bouchard, Today\u2019s Trucking. July 2011.</ref>\n\n===Agriculture===\nMost activities related to healthy crops and good yields depend on timely availability of weather and soil data. Therefore, wireless weather stations play a major role in disease prevention and precision irrigation. These stations transmit parameters necessary for decision-making to a base station: [[air temperature]] and [[relative humidity]], [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[leaf wetness]] (for disease prediction models), solar radiation and wind speed (to calculate [[evapotranspiration]]), water deficit stress (WDS) leaf sensors and soil moisture (crucial to irrigation decisions).\n\nBecause local micro-climates can vary significantly, such data needs to come from within the crop. Monitoring stations usually transmit data back by terrestrial [[radio]], although occasionally [[satellite]] systems are used. Solar power is often employed to make the station independent of the power grid.\n\n===Water management===\nTelemetry is important in water management, including [[water quality]] and [[stream gauge|stream gauging]] functions. Major applications include AMR ([[automatic meter reading]]), [[groundwater]] monitoring, leak detection in distribution pipelines and equipment surveillance. Having data available in almost real time allows quick reactions to events in the field. Telemetry control allows to intervene with assets such as pumps and allows to remotely switch pumps on or off depending on the circumstances.  Watershed telemetry is an excellent strategy of how to implement a water management system.\n<ref>https://etd.ohiolink.edu/ap/10?0::NO:10:P10_ACCESSION_NUM:ucin1183994884</ref>\n\n===Swimming pools===\nTelemetry is used to transmit data in real time to server-based databases and applications with interfaces allowing monitoring and control. Server-side data storage and interpretation offers increased pool reliability. Additional data points, such as weather telemetry locally gathered or from Internet sources, can offer increased refinement of the control functions, reducing the requirement for consumables to manage water quality. Telemetry is also used to monitor health and usage of local equipment in the pump house. A properly designed telemetry and control system can offer additional benefits in professional management of maintenance contracts, with significant reduction in labor cost per client. PCFR SAS's PoolCop / PoolCopilot technology is an example of this approach to swimming pool management and control using telemetry transmitted from the pump house using the client's Internet service.\n\n==={{anchor|Defense, space and resource exploration systems}}Defense, space and resource exploration===\nTelemetry is used in complex systems such as missiles, RPVs, [[spacecraft]], [[Oil platform|oil rig]]s, and [[chemical plant]]s since it allows the automatic monitoring, alerting, and record-keeping necessary for efficient and safe operation. Space agencies such as [[ISRO]], [[NASA]], the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), and other agencies use telemetry and/or telecommand systems to collect data from spacecraft and satellites.\n\nTelemetry is vital in the development of missiles, satellites and aircraft because the system might be destroyed during or after the test. Engineers need critical system parameters to analyze (and improve) the performance of the system. In the absence of telemetry, this data would often be unavailable.\n\n====Space science====\nTelemetry is used by manned or unmanned spacecraft for data transmission. Distances of more than 10 billion kilometres have been covered, e.g., by [[Voyager&nbsp;1]].\n\n====Rocketry====\nIn rocketry, telemetry equipment forms an integral part of the [[rocket range]] assets used to monitor the position and health of a launch vehicle to determine range safety flight termination criteria (Range purpose is for public safety). Problems include the extreme environment (temperature, acceleration and vibration), the [[energy supply]], [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] alignment and (at long distances, e.g., in [[spaceflight]]) signal [[time of flight|travel time]].\n\n===={{anchor|Flight test}}Flight testing====\nToday nearly every type of [[aircraft]], [[missile]]s, or [[spacecraft]] carries a wireless telemetry system as it is tested.<ref>\u201cFoster, Leroy.\" \"Telemetry Systems\", ''[[John Wiley & Sons]]\u201d, New York, 1965.</ref> Aeronautical mobile telemetry is used for the safety of the pilots and persons on the ground during flight tests. Telemetry from an on-board [[flight test instrumentation]] system is the primary source of real-time measurement and status information transmitted during the testing of manned and unmanned aircraft.<ref>\u201d  ITU-R M.2286-0 Operational characteristics of aeronautical mobile telemetry systems\u201d, ''[[International Telecommunication Union]]\u201d', Geneva 2014.</ref>\n\n===={{anchor|Enemy intelligence}}Military intelligence====\nIntercepted telemetry was an important source of intelligence for the United States and UK when [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] missiles were tested; for this purpose, the United States operated a listening post in [[Iran]]. Eventually, the Russians discovered the United States intelligence-gathering network and encrypted their missile-test telemetry signals. Telemetry was also a source for the Soviets, who operated listening ships in [[Cardigan Bay]] to eavesdrop on UK missile tests performed in the area.\n\n===Energy monitoring===\nIn factories, buildings and houses, energy consumption of systems such as [[HVAC]] are monitored at multiple locations; related parameters (e.g., temperature) are sent via wireless telemetry to a central location. The information is collected and processed, enabling the most efficient use of energy. Such systems also facilitate [[predictive maintenance]].\n\n===Resource distribution===\nMany resources need to be distributed over wide areas. Telemetry is useful in these cases, since it allows the system to channel resources where they are needed; examples of this are tank farms in gasoline refineries and chemical plants.\n\n===Medicine/Healthcare===\nTelemetry is used for patients ([[biotelemetry]]) who are at risk of abnormal [[heart]] activity, generally in a [[coronary care unit]]. Telemetry specialists are sometimes used to [[monitoring (medicine)|monitor]] many patients with a hospital.<ref name=\"pmid25746509\">{{cite journal |author=Segall N, [[Gene Hobbs|Hobbs G]], Granger CB, Anderson AE, Bonifacio AS, Taekman JM, Wright MC |title=Patient load effects on response time to critical arrhythmias in cardiac telemetry: a randomized trial |journal=Critical Care Medicine |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=1036\u201342 |year=2015 |pmid=25746509 |doi=10.1097/CCM.0000000000000923 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0090-3493&volume=43&issue=5&spage=1036 |accessdate=2015-12-24}}</ref> Such patients are outfitted with measuring, recording and transmitting devices. A data log can be useful in [[cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures|diagnosis]] of the patient's condition by [[physician|doctor]]s.  An alerting function can alert [[nurse]]s if the patient is suffering from an acute (or dangerous) condition.\n\nSystems are available in [[medical-surgical nursing]] for monitoring to rule out a heart condition, or to monitor a response to [[antiarrhythmic medication]]s such as [[amiodarone]].\n\nA new and emerging application for telemetry is in the field of neurophysiology, or neurotelemetry. [[Neurophysiology]] is the study of the central and peripheral nervous systems through the recording of bioelectrical activity, whether spontaneous or stimulated.  In neurotelemetry (NT) the [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG) of a patient is monitored remotely by a registered EEG technologist using advanced communication software.  The goal of neurotelemetry is to recognize a decline in a patient's condition before physical signs and symptoms are present.\n\nNeurotelemetry is synonymous with [[Long-term video-EEG monitoring|real-time continuous video EEG monitoring]] and has application in the epilepsy monitoring unit, neuro ICU, pediatric ICU and newborn ICU.  Due to the labor-intensive nature of continuous EEG monitoring NT is typically done in the larger academic teaching hospitals using in-house programs that include R.EEG Technologists, IT support staff, neurologist and neurophysiologist and monitoring support personnel.\n\nModern microprocessor speeds, software algorithms and video data compression allow hospitals to centrally record and monitor continuous digital EEGs of multiple critically ill patients simultaneously.\n\nNeurotelemetry and continuous EEG monitoring provides dynamic information about brain function that permits early detection of changes in neurologic status, which is especially useful when the clinical examination is limited.\n\n==={{anchor|Fisheries and wildlife research and management}}Fishery and wildlife research and management===\n{{main article|Wildlife radio telemetry}}\n[[File:A bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) worker with a transponder attached to its back, visiting an oilseed rape flower.png|thumb|A [[Bombus terrestris|bumblebee]] worker with a transponder attached to its back, visiting an [[oilseed rape]] flower]]\nTelemetry is used to study wildlife,<ref>{{cite web|title=Marine Wildlife Telemetry|url=http://www.sealtag.org/index.html|publisher=Pinniped Ecology Applied Research Laboratory|accessdate=30 January 2012}}</ref> and has been useful for monitoring threatened species at the individual level.  Animals under study can be outfitted with instrumentation tags, which include sensors that measure temperature, diving depth and duration (for marine animals), speed and location (using [[GPS]] or [[P91-1 ARGOS|Argos]] packages).  Telemetry tags can give researchers information about animal behavior, functions, and their environment. This information is then either stored (with archival tags) or the tags can send (or transmit) their information to a satellite or handheld receiving device.<ref>{{cite web|title=What Is Telemetry?|url=http://www.sealtag.org/What%20Is%20Telemetry.html|publisher=Pinniped Ecology Applied Research Laboratory|accessdate=25 July 2011}}</ref> Capturing and marking wild animals can put them at some risk, so it is important to minimize these impacts.<ref>Livezey, K.B. 1990. Toward the reduction of marking-induced abandonment of newborn ungulates. Wildlife Society Bulletin 18:193\u2013203.</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Retail businesses}}Retail===\nAt a 2005 workshop in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], a seminar noted the introduction of telemetry equipment which would allow [[vending machine]]s to communicate sales and inventory data to a route truck or to a headquarters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} This data could be used for a variety of purposes, such as eliminating the need for drivers to make a first trip to see which items needed to be restocked before delivering the inventory.\n\nRetailers also use [[RFID]] tags to track inventory and prevent shoplifting. Most of these tags passively respond to RFID readers (e.g., at the cashier), but active RFID tags are available which periodically transmit location information to a base station.\n\n===Law enforcement===\nTelemetry hardware is useful for tracking persons and property in law enforcement. An ankle collar worn by convicts on probation can warn authorities if a person violates the terms of his or her [[parole]], such as by straying from authorized boundaries or visiting an unauthorized location. Telemetry has also enabled [[bait car]]s, where law enforcement can rig a car with cameras and tracking equipment and leave it somewhere they expect it to be stolen. When stolen the telemetry equipment reports the location of the vehicle, enabling law enforcement to deactivate the engine and lock the doors when it is stopped by responding officers.\n\n==={{anchor|Electrical energy providers}}Energy providers===\nIn some countries, telemetry is used to measure the amount of electrical energy consumed. The electricity meter communicates with a [[concentrator]], and the latter sends the information through [[GPRS]] or [[GSM]] to the energy provider's server. Telemetry is also used for the remote monitoring of substations and their equipment. For data transmission, phase line carrier systems operating on frequencies between 30 and 400&nbsp;kHz are sometimes used.\n\n===Falconry===\nIn [[falconry]], \"telemetry\" means a small radio transmitter carried by a [[bird of prey]] that will allow the bird's owner to track it when it is out of sight.\n\n===Testing===\nTelemetry is used in testing hostile environments which are dangerous for humans to be present . Examples include munitions storage facilities, radioactive sites, volcanoes, deep sea, and outer space\n\n===Communications===\nTelemetry is used in many battery operated wireless systems to inform monitoring personnel when the battery power is reaching a low point and the end item needs fresh batteries.\n\n===Mining===\nIn the mining industry, telemetry serves two main purposes: the measurement of key parameters from mining equipment and the monitoring of safety practices.<ref>Telemetry in the Mining Industry.
