The [[whole-life cost]] of electricity includes payments on this debt.\n\nAs technology improves, with all else equal, the cost of generating electricity falls. A new entrant to the [[Market (economics)|market]], unencumbered by debt, can build a modern plant and generate electricity at a lower cost than existing providers. Logical customers leave the incumbent utility for the new entrant, reducing the incumbent's [[revenue]] and spreading its debt payments across fewer remaining customers.\n\nThe problem is often caused by overlong [[depreciation]] schedules for capital investments by utilities, presuming that regulatory and market conditions would not change substantially.\n\nSolutions to the stranded costs problem include assigning a portion of the incumbent utility's debt to the new entrant as a condition of entry, or charging all customers in the market area a \"stranded cost recovery fee\". In some cases, a government may assume a portion of an incumbent utility's debt and assign it to the public debt, thus freeing the incumbent to compete more efficiently against new entrants.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Stranded Costs |title=Draft Working Model for Restructuring the Electric Utility Industry |chapterurl= http://www.scc.virginia.gov/comm/reports/streprt4.pdf |url=https://www.scc.virginia.gov/power/history.aspx |publisher=Virginia State Corporation Commission |date=1997 |accessdate=October 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Stranded asset]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Electricity economics]]\n[[Category:Electric power distribution]]"}]}}}}
