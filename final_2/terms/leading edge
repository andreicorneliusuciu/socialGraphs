A straight leading edge may be swept or unswept, the latter meaning that it is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft.  As [[swept wing|wing sweep]] is conventionally measured at the 25% [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] line<ref name=Kumar/> an unswept wing may have a swept or tapered leading edge. Some aircraft, like the [[General Dynamics F-111]], have [[swing-wing]]s where the sweep of both wing and leading edge can be varied.\n\nIn high-speed aircraft, compression heating of the air ahead of the wings can cause extreme heating of the leading edge. Heating was a major contributor to the destruction of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] during re-entry on February 1, 2003.\n\n==Sail boats==\nWhen sailing into the wind, the dynamics that propel a [[sailboat]] forward are the same that create lift for an airplane.  The term leading edge refers to the part of the sail that first contacts the wind.  A fine tapered leading edge that does not disturb the flow is desirable since 90% of the drag on a sailboat owing to sails is a result of [[vortex shedding]] from the edges of the sail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://syr.stanford.edu/JWEIA557.pdf  |title=Numerical simulation of the turbulent flow past upwind yacht sails|author1=Collie,S.J. |author2=M.G. Gerritsen |author3=M.J. O'Sullivan |accessdate=December 10, 2011}}</ref>  Sailboats utilize a mast to support the sail.  To help reduce the drag and poor net sail performance, designers have experimented with masts that are more aerodynamically shaped, rotating masts, wing masts, or placed the mast behind the sails as in the [[mast aft rig]].\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Leading edge (aircraft wings)}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Aircraft components}}\n\n[[Category:Aircraft wing design]]\n\n\n{{Aviation-stub}}"}]}}}}
