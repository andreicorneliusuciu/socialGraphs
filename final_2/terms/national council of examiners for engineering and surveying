It is headquartered in [[Seneca, South Carolina]], across [[Lake Hartwell]] from [[Clemson University]].<ref name=\"About\"/>\n\n== Engineering ==\n\nNCEES is responsible for the administration of the exams that engineers must pass in order to become certified as a  [[Professional Engineer]]. These include:\n* The [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam|Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam]] is usually taken during college or soon after graduating is one of the first steps to becoming a registered Professional Engineer. The FE exam will be administered via computer-based testing (CBT) beginning January 2014.<ref name=\"CBT\">{{cite web |url=http://cbt.ncees.org/ |title=The CBT experience |publisher=National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying |accessdate=2012-12-19}}</ref>\n* The [[Principles and Practice of Engineering Exam|Principles and Practice of Engineering (PE) exam]] tests one's ability to practice competently in a particular engineering discipline. It is designed for engineers who have gained at least four years\u2019 post-college work experience in their chosen engineering discipline. The PE exam is typically the last step in the process of becoming a licensed P.E. \n* The [[Structural Engineering exam|Structural Engineering (S.E.) exam]] tests one's ability to competently practice [[structural engineering]].  It is specifically designed for engineers who practice in jurisdictions that may license structural engineers separately from other professional engineers. Some States, like California, or jurisdictions contained therein, consider the P.E. to be the license, while the S.E. is a certification or title among licensed civil engineers, which may confer additional rights and responsibilities above the P.E. license.  Indeed, in California, a licensed Civil Engineer who designs buildings or bridges may only legally use the title Structural Engineer if he has passed the S.E. exam.\n\n== Land surveying ==\n\nNCEES also prepares examinations for Land [[Surveyor (surveying)|Surveyor]] licensing in the United States.  These exams consist of:\n* The [[Fundamentals of Surveying Exam|Fundamentals of Surveying (FS) exam]] is typically the first step in the process of becoming a licensed professional surveyor. It is designed for undergraduates who are close to finishing an undergraduate degree. The FS exam will be administered via computer-based testing (CBT) beginning January 2014.<ref name=\"CBT\"/>\n* The [[Principles and Practice of Surveying Exam|Principles and Practice of Surveying (PS) exam]] tests one's ability to practice the surveying profession competently. It is designed for surveyors who have gained at least four years\u2019 experience. It is typically the last step in the process of becoming a licensed professional surveyor.\n\n== Records ==\n\nIn addition, NCEES assists with record keeping for those engineers and surveyors who already have a license.  A Professional Engineer or a Professional Surveyor can request that NCEES submit his or her record to another state in order to be recognized as a Professional Engineer or Professional Surveyor within that state.  This process keeps their respective records in one place to transmit from state to state as they work on different jobs in different states.\n\n== Credentials evaluations ==\n\nIn September 2006, NCEES began offering an evaluations service to aid its member licensing boards. Through its Credentials Evaluations department, NCEES evaluates transcripts and other documents provided by candidates for licensure who have studied engineering outside the United States, comparing their academic backgrounds to the accreditation criteria used for corresponding degree programs in the U.S.[] The licensing boards then use this information in determining whether to grant the P.E. license.<ref name=\"CE\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncees.org/Credentials_evaluations.php |title=Credentials Evaluations |publisher=National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying |accessdate=2012-12-19}}</ref>\n\n== Study materials ==\nNCEES sells Sample Questions and Solutions for each exam. The sample exams include questions that have been used on past exams and questions written just for study materials by those who create the exams to give you extra practice. The Supplied-Reference materials for the FE, FS, and PS exam are also available for purchase or digital download.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Engineering]]\n*[[Fundamentals of Engineering Examination]]\n*[[Principles and Practice of Engineering Examination]] (PE exam)\n*[[Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering]] (GATE)\n*[[Glossary of engineering]]\n*[[Glossary of civil engineering]]\n*[[Glossary of electrical and electronics engineering]]\n*[[Glossary of mechanical engineering]]\n*[[Glossary of structural engineering]]\n*[[Glossary of biology]]\n*[[Glossary of chemistry terms|Glossary of chemistry]]\n*[[Glossary of economics]]\n*[[Glossary of physics]]\n*[[Glossary of probability and statistics]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{official website|http://www.ncees.org/}}\n\n[[Category:Professional certification in engineering]]\n[[Category:American engineering organizations]]\n[[Category:Organizations based in South Carolina]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1920]]"}]}}}}
