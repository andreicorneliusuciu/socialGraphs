When the flying object returns to water, the process is called '''alighting''', although it is commonly called \"landing,\" \"touchdown\" or \"[[Splashdown (spacecraft landing)|splashdown]]\" as well. A normal aircraft flight would include several parts of flight including [[taxiing|taxi]], [[takeoff]], [[climb (aeronautics)|climb]], [[Cruise (flight)|cruise]], [[descent (aircraft)|descent]] and landing.\n\n== Aircraft ==\nAircraft usually land at an [[airport]] on a firm [[runway]] or [[helicopter landing pad]], generally constructed of [[asphalt concrete]], [[concrete]], gravel or grass. Aircraft equipped with pontoons ([[floatplane]]) or with a boat hull-shaped fuselage (a [[flying boat]]) are able to land on water. Aircraft also sometimes use skis to land on snow or ice.\n\nTo land, the airspeed and the rate of descent are reduced such that the object descends at a low enough rate to allow for a gentle touch down. Landing is accomplished by slowing down and descending to the runway. This speed reduction is accomplished by reducing thrust and/or inducing a greater amount of drag using flaps, [[landing gear]] or [[Air brake (aircraft)|speed brakes]]. When a fixed-wing aircraft approaches the ground, the pilot will move the control column back to execute a [[Landing flare|flare]] or round-out. This increases the [[angle of attack]]. Progressive movement of the control column back will allow the aircraft to settle onto the runway at minimum speed, landing on its main wheels first in the case of a [[tricycle gear]] aircraft or on all three wheels simultaneously in the case of a [[conventional landing gear]]-equipped aircraft, commonly referred to as a \"taildragger\". This is known as flaring.<ref name=\"AviationGlossary\">{{cite web|url = http://aviationglossary.com/icao-definition/flare-icao-definition/|title = Flare (ICAO Definition)|accessdate = 26 January 2011|last = Aviation Glossary|authorlink = |year = 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Phase\">{{cite web|url = http://www.intlaviationstandards.org/Documents/PhaseofFlightDefinitions.pdf|title = Phase of Flight Definitions and Usage Notes|accessdate = 26 January 2011|last = [[International Civil Aviation Organization]]|authorlink = |date=June 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"CraneFlare\">Crane, Dale: ''Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition'', page 217.

ISBN 0-7715-5115-0</ref>\n\n=== Light aircraft ===\nIn a [[light aircraft]], with little [[crosswind]], the ideal landing is when contact with the ground occurs as the forward speed is reduced to the point where there is no longer sufficient airspeed to remain aloft. The [[stall (flight)|stall]] warning is often heard just before landing, indicating that this speed and altitude have been reached. The result is very light touch down.<ref name=\"TC\" />\n\nLight aircraft landing situations, and the pilot skills required, can be divided into four types:\n* Normal landings<ref name=\"TC\" />\n* [[Crosswind landing]]s - where a significant wind not aligned with the landing area is a factor<ref name=\"TC\" />\n* Short field landings - where the length of the landing area is a limiting factor<ref name=\"TC\" />\n* Soft and unprepared field landings - where the landing area is wet, soft or has ground obstacles such as furrows or ruts to contend with<ref name=\"TC\" />\n\n=== Large aircraft ===\nIn large [[transport category]] (airliner) aircraft, pilots land the aircraft by \"flying the airplane on to the runway.\" The airspeed and [[Orientation (geometry)|attitude]]<!-- The correct term is \"attitude\" here, not altitude, please do not change this without discussion on the talk page first --> of the plane are adjusted for landing. The airspeed is kept well above stall speed and at a constant rate of descent. A [[Landing flare|flare]] is performed just before landing, and the descent rate is significantly reduced, causing a light touch down. Upon touchdown, [[lift dumper|spoiler]]s (sometimes called \"lift dumpers\") are deployed to dramatically reduce the lift and transfer the aircraft's weight to its wheels, where mechanical [[braking]], such as an [[autobrake]] system, can take effect. [[Reverse thrust]] is used by many [[jet aircraft]] to help slow down just after touch-down, redirecting engine exhaust forward instead of back. Some [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]-driven airplanes also have this feature, where the blades of the propeller are re-angled to push air forward instead of back using the 'beta range'.\n\n=== Environmental factors ===\nFactors such as [[crosswind]] where the pilot will use a [[crab landing]] or a [[slip landing]] will cause pilots to land slightly faster and sometimes with different aircraft attitude to ensure a safe landing.\n\nOther factors affecting a particular landing might include: the plane size, [[wind]], [[weight]], runway length, obstacles, [[ground effect in aircraft|ground effects]], [[weather]], runway altitude, [[air temperature]], [[atmospheric pressure|air pressure]], [[air traffic control]], [[visibility]], [[avionics]] and the overall situation.\n\nFor example, landing a multi-engine [[turboprop]] military such as a [[C-130 Hercules]], under fire in a grass field in a war zone, requires different skills and precautions than landing a single engine plane such as a [[Cessna 150]] on a paved runway in uncontrolled airspace, which is different from landing an airliner such as an [[Airbus A380]] at a major airport with [[air traffic control]].\n\n[[Required Navigation Performance]] (RNP) is being used more and more. Rather than using radio beacons, the airplane uses GPS-navigation for landing using this technique. This translates into a much more fluid ascend, which results in decreased noise, and decreased fuel consumption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geaviation.com/systems/products-and-services/performance-based-navigation/learning-rnp.html |title=Required Navigation Performance &#124; GE Aviation Systems |publisher=GE Aviation |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref>\n\n== Parachutes ==\nThe term \"landing\" is also applied to people or objects descending to the ground using a [[parachute]]. Some consider these objects to be in a controlled descent instead of actually flying. Most parachutes work by capturing air, inducing enough drag that the falling object hits the ground at a relatively slow speed. There are many examples of parachutes in nature, including the seeds of a [[dandelion]].\n\nOn the other hand, modern [[ram-air parachute]]s are essentially inflatable wings that operate in a [[gliding flight]] mode. Parachutists execute a flare at landing, reducing or eliminating both downward and forward speed at touchdown, in order to avoid injury.<ref name=\"USPA\">{{cite web|url = http://www.uspa.org/SIM/Read/Section4/CategoryA/tabid/176/Default.aspx#1d|title = Canopy piloting skills|accessdate = 6 September 2011|last = [[United States Parachute Association]]|authorlink = |year = 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Spacecraft ==\n\n{{further|Lander (spacecraft)}}\n\nSometimes, a safe landing is accomplished by using multiple forms of lift, thrust (''propulsive landing''<ref>Samad Hayati, et al, [http://mepag.nasa.gov/decadal/SamadAHayati.pdf Strategic Technology Development for  Future Mars Missions (2013-2022)], NASA, September 15, 2009</ref>) and dampening systems. Both the [[Surveyor program|Surveyor]] unmanned lunar probe craft, and the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] used a rocket deceleration system and landing gear to soft-land on the moon. Several Soviet rockets including the [[Soyuz spacecraft]] have used parachutes and [[Airbag#Airbag landing systems|airbag landing system]]s to dampen the landing on earth.\nIn December 2015, [[SpaceX]]'s [[Falcon 9 full thrust|Falcon 9]] became the first launch vehicle on an orbital trajectory [[Falcon 9 Flight 20|to successfully vertically-land and recover]] its first stage.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Arresting gear]]\n* [[Landing performance]]\n* [[Instrument landing system]] (ILS)\n* [[Instrument flight rules]] (IFR)\n* [[Visual flight rules]] (VFR)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Types of take-off and landing}}\n\n[[Category:Types of take-off and landing]]\n[[Category:Flight phases]]\n[[Category:Types of landing]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]"}]}}}}
