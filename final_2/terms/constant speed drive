They are used to drive mechanisms, typically [[electrical generator]]s, that require a constant input speed. Constant speed drives are usually found as part of the [[accessory drive]]s of [[gas turbine]] engines, such as aircraft [[jet engine]]s. Constant-speed drives are usually found supplying accessory equipment and are rarely needed for an engine's main power output.\n\n==Mechanism==\nCSDs are mainly used on [[airliner]] and [[military aircraft]] jet engines to drive the [[alternating current]] (AC) electrical generator. In order to produce the proper voltage at a constant AC frequency, usually three-phase 115 VAC at 400&nbsp;Hz, a generator needs to spin at a constant specific speed (typically 6,000 RPM for air-cooled generators).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ct3/ctenning/electrical_essays/777elecpwr/777_design.html|title=Designing the 777 Electrical Power System|author=Carl Tenning|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref> Since the jet engine gearbox speed varies from idle to full power, this creates the need for a constant speed drive (CSD).  The CSD takes the variable speed output of the accessory drive gearbox and hydro-mechanically produces a constant output RPM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.k-makris.gr/AircraftComponents/CSD/C.S.D.htm|title=CSD|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4310768.html|title=Constant speed drive \u2013 Rolls-Royce Limited|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Integrated drive generator==\nOn aircraft such as the [[Airbus A310]], [[Airbus A320 family]], [[Airbus A320neo]], [[Airbus A330]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smartcockpit.com/aircraft-ressources/A330-Electrical.html|title=A330 Electrical|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref> [[Airbus A330neo]], [[Airbus A340]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smartcockpit.com/aircraft-ressources/FCOM_A340-Electrical.html|title=FCOM A340 Electrical|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref> [[Boeing 737 Next Generation]], [[Boeing 747|747]], [[Boeing 757|757]], [[Boeing 767|767]] and [[Boeing 777|777]], an integrated drive generator (IDG) is used.<ref>{{Cite book\n  |title=The Aircraft Gas Turbine Engine and its Operation\n  |work=P&W Oper.
