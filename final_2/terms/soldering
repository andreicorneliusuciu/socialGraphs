Soldering differs from [[welding]] in that soldering does not involve melting the work pieces. In [[brazing]], the filler metal melts at a higher temperature, but the work piece metal does not melt. In the past, nearly all solders contained [[lead]], but environmental and health concerns have increasingly dictated use of [[lead-free solder|lead-free alloys]] for electronics and plumbing purposes.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Solder sugarlabs.jpg|thumb|right|Small figurine being created by soldering]]\n\nThere is evidence that soldering was employed as early as 5000 years ago in Mesopotamia.<ref>{{cite book | title = Materials Handbook | first = George| last= Brady | publisher = McGraw Hill | pages = 768\u201370 | isbn = 0-07-007084-9 | year = 1996|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Soldering and [[brazing]] are thought to have originated very early in the history of metal-working, probably before 4000 BC.<ref>[http://www.weldinghistory.org/whistoryfolder/brazing/bh_pre1900s.html A History of Welding]</ref> Sumerian swords from ~3000 BC were assembled using hard soldering.\n\nSoldering was historically used to make jewelry items, cooking ware and tools, as well as other uses such as in assembling [[stained glass]].\n\n== Applications ==\nSoldering is used in plumbing, electronics, and metalwork from [[Flashing (weatherproofing)|flashing]] to jewelry. \n \nSoldering provides reasonably permanent but reversible connections between copper pipes in [[plumbing]] systems as well as joints in sheet metal objects such as food cans, [[Flashing (weatherproofing)|roof flashing]], [[rain gutter]]s and automobile [[radiator]]s.\n\n[[Jewelry]] components, machine tools and some refrigeration and plumbing components are often assembled and repaired by the higher temperature silver soldering process. Small mechanical parts are often soldered or brazed as well. Soldering is also used to join lead [[came]] and [[Came glasswork|copper foil]] in [[Came glasswork|stained glass]] work. \n\nElectronic soldering connects [[electrical wiring]] and [[electronic component]]s to [[printed circuit board]]s (PCBs).\n\n== Solders ==\n{{main|Solder}}\nSoldering filler materials are available in many different [[alloy]]s for differing applications. In electronics assembly, the [[eutectic]] alloy of 63% tin and 37% lead (or 60/40, which is almost identical in melting point) has been the alloy of choice. Other alloys are used for plumbing, mechanical assembly, and other applications. Some examples of soft-solder are tin-lead for general purposes, tin-zinc for joining [[aluminium]], lead-silver for strength at higher than room temperature, cadmium-silver for strength at high temperatures, zinc-aluminium for aluminium and corrosion resistance, and tin-silver and tin-bismuth for electronics.\n\nA eutectic formulation has advantages when applied to soldering: the [[liquidus]] and [[Solidus (chemistry)|solidus]] temperatures are the same, so there is no plastic phase, and it has the lowest possible melting point. Having the lowest possible melting point minimizes heat stress on electronic components during soldering. And, having no plastic phase allows for quicker wetting as the solder heats up, and quicker setup as the solder cools. A non-eutectic formulation must remain still as the temperature drops through the liquidus and solidus temperatures. Any movement during the plastic phase may result in cracks, resulting in an unreliable joint.\n\nCommon solder formulations based on tin and lead are listed below. The fraction represent percentage of tin first, then lead, totaling 100%:\n\n* 63/37: melts at {{convert|183|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} (eutectic: the only mixture that melts at a ''point'', instead of over a range)\n* 60/40: melts between {{convert|183|\u2013|190|C|F}}\n* 50/50: melts between {{convert|183|\u2013|215|C|F}}\n\nFor environmental reasons (and the introduction of regulations such as the European RoHS ([[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive]])), lead-free solders are becoming more widely used. They are also suggested anywhere young children may come into contact with (since young children are likely to place things into their mouths), or for outdoor use where rain and other precipitation may wash the lead into the groundwater. Unfortunately, most lead-free solders are not eutectic formulations, melting at around {{convert|250|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, making it more difficult to create reliable joints with them.\n\nOther common solders include low-temperature formulations (often containing [[bismuth]]), which are often used to join previously-soldered assemblies without un-soldering earlier connections, and high-temperature formulations (usually containing [[silver]]) which are used for high-temperature operation or for first assembly of items which must not become unsoldered during subsequent operations. Alloying silver with other metals changes the melting point, adhesion and wetting characteristics, and tensile strength. Of all the brazing alloys, silver solders have the greatest strength and the broadest applications.<ref>[http://www.tinmantech.com/html/faq_brazing_versus_soldering.php How soldering differs from brazing<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Specialty alloys are available with properties such as higher strength, the ability to solder aluminum, better electrical conductivity, and higher corrosion resistance.<ref name=\"Solder Product List\">{{cite web|last=Kapp Alloy & Wire, Inc|title=Products|url=http://www.kappalloy.com/products-solder.php|publisher=Kapp Alloy & Wire, Inc|accessdate=5 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Flux==\n{{main|flux (metallurgy)}}\n\nThe purpose of [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] is to facilitate the soldering process. One of the obstacles to a successful solder joint is an impurity at the site of the joint, for example, dirt, oil or [[oxidation]]. The impurities can be removed by mechanical cleaning or by chemical means, but the elevated temperatures required to melt the filler metal (the solder) encourages the work piece (and the solder) to re-oxidize. This effect is accelerated as the soldering temperatures increase and can completely prevent the solder from joining to the workpiece. One of the earliest forms of flux was [[charcoal]], which acts as a [[reducing agent]] and helps prevent oxidation during the soldering process. Some fluxes go beyond the simple prevention of oxidation and also provide some form of chemical cleaning (corrosion).\n\nFor many years, the most common type of flux used in electronics (soft soldering) was [[rosin]]-based, using the rosin from selected [[pine tree]]s. It was ideal in that it was non-corrosive and non-conductive at normal temperatures but became mildly reactive (corrosive) at the elevated soldering temperatures. Plumbing and automotive applications, among others, typically use an acid-based ([[hydrochloric acid]]) flux which provides cleaning of the joint. These fluxes cannot be used in electronics because they are conductive and because they will eventually dissolve the small diameter wires. Many fluxes also act as a [[wetting agent]] in the soldering process,<ref>[http://www.indium.com/products/solderfabrications/fluxes.php Solder Flux]</ref> reducing the [[surface tension]] of the molten solder and causing it to flow and wet the workpieces more easily.\n\nFluxes for soft solder are currently available in three basic formulations:\n# Water-soluble fluxes -  higher activity fluxes designed to be removed with water after soldering (no [[Volatile organic compound|VOC]]s required for removal).\n# No-clean fluxes -  mild enough to not \"require\" removal due to their non-conductive and non-corrosive residue.<ref name=\"indiumcorporation\"/> These fluxes are called \"no-clean\" because the residue left after the solder operation is non-conductive and won't cause electrical shorts; nevertheless they leave a plainly visible white residue that resembles diluted bird-droppings. No-clean flux residue is acceptable on all 3 classes of PCBs as defined by IPC-610 provided it does not inhibit visual inspection, access to test points, or have a wet, tacky or excessive residue that may spread onto other areas. Connector mating surfaces must also be free of flux residue.  Fingerprints in no-clean residue are a class 3 defect<ref>IPC-A-610 revision E section 10.6.4</ref>\n# Traditional [[rosin]] fluxes - available in non-activated (R), mildly activated (RMA) and activated (RA) formulations. RA and RMA fluxes contain rosin combined with an activating agent, typically an acid, which increases the wettability of metals to which it is applied by removing existing oxides. The residue resulting from the use of RA flux is [[corrosive]] and must be cleaned. RMA flux is formulated to result in a residue which is not significantly corrosive, with cleaning being preferred but optional.\n\nFlux performance needs to be carefully evaluated; a very mild 'no-clean' flux might be perfectly acceptable for production equipment, but not give adequate performance for a poorly controlled hand-soldering operation.\n\n==Processes==\n[[File:Brazing and soldering processes - AWS A3.0 2001.svg|thumb|right|300px|Brazing and soldering processes [[classification chart]]<ref>AWS A3.0:2001, Standard Welding Terms and Definitions Including Terms for Adhesive Bonding, Brazing, Soldering, Thermal Cutting, and Thermal Spraying, American Welding Society (2001), p. 118. ISBN 0-87171-624-0</ref>]]\nThere are three forms of soldering, each requiring progressively higher temperatures and producing an increasingly stronger joint strength:\n# soft soldering, which originally used a tin-lead [[alloy]] as the filler metal\n# silver soldering, which uses an alloy containing [[silver]]\n# [[brazing]] which uses a [[brass]] alloy for the filler\n\nThe alloy of the filler metal for each type of soldering can be adjusted to modify the melting temperature of the filler. Soldering differs from gluing significantly in that the filler metals alloy with the workpiece at the junction to form a gas- and liquid-tight bond.<ref name=indiumcorporation>[http://www.indium.com/_dynamo/download.php?docid=27 Soldering 101 - A Basic Overview]</ref>\n\nSoft soldering is characterized by having a melting point of the filler metal below approximately {{convert|400|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite book | title = The Basics of Soldering | first = Armin | last= Rahn | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | chapter = 1.1 Introduction | isbn = 0-471-58471-1 | year = 1993}}</ref> whereas silver soldering and brazing use higher temperatures, typically requiring a flame or carbon arc torch to achieve the melting of the filler. Soft solder filler metals are typically alloys (often containing [[lead]]) that have [[liquidus]] temperatures below 350&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nIn this soldering process, heat is applied to the parts to be joined, causing the solder to melt and to bond to the workpieces in an alloying process called [[wetting]]. In stranded wire, the solder is drawn up into the wire by [[capillary action]] in a process called 'wicking'. Capillary action also takes place when the workpieces are very close together or touching. The joint's [[tensile strength]] is dependent on the filler metal used. Soldering produces electrically-conductive, water- and gas-tight joints.\n\nEach type of solder offers advantages and disadvantages. Soft solder is so called because of the soft lead that is its primary ingredient. Soft soldering uses the lowest temperatures but does not make a strong joint and is unsuitable for mechanical load-bearing applications. It is also unsuitable for high-temperature applications as it softens and melts. Silver soldering, as used by jewelers, machinists and in some plumbing applications, requires the use of a torch or other high-temperature source, and is much stronger than soft soldering. Brazing provides the strongest joint but also requires the hottest temperatures to melt the filler metal, requiring a torch or other high temperature source and darkened goggles to protect the eyes from the bright light produced by the white-hot work. It is often used to repair cast-iron objects, wrought-iron furniture, etc.\n\nSoldering operations can be performed with hand tools, one joint at a time, or ''en masse'' on a production line. Hand soldering is typically performed with a [[soldering iron]], [[soldering gun]], or a torch, or occasionally a [[hot-air pencil]]. Sheetmetal work was traditionally done with \"soldering coppers\" directly heated by a flame, with sufficient stored heat in the mass of the soldering copper to complete a joint; torches or electrically-heated soldering irons are more convenient. All soldered joints require the same elements of cleaning of the metal parts to be joined, fitting up the joint, heating the parts, applying flux, applying the filler, removing heat and holding the assembly still until the filler metal has completely solidified. Depending on the nature of flux material used, cleaning of the joints may be required after they have cooled.\n\nEach alloy has characteristics that work best for certain applications, notably strength and conductivity, and each type of solder and alloy has different melting temperatures. The term ''silver solder'' likewise denotes the type of solder that is used. Some soft solders are \"silver-bearing\" alloys used to solder silver-plated items. Lead-based solders should not be used on precious metals because the lead dissolves the metal and disfigures it.\n\n===Soldering and brazing===\nThe distinction between soldering and brazing is based on the melting temperature of the filler alloy. A temperature of 450&nbsp;\u00b0C is usually used as a practical delineating point between soldering and brazing . Soft soldering can be done with a heated iron whereas the other methods require a higher temperature torch or furnace to melt the filler metal.\n\nDifferent equipment is usually required since a [[soldering iron]] cannot achieve high enough temperatures for hard soldering or brazing. Brazing filler metal is stronger than silver solder, which is stronger than lead-based soft solder. Brazing solders are formulated primarily for strength, silver solder is used by jewelers to protect the precious metal and by machinists and refrigeration technicians for its tensile strength but lower melting temperature than brazing, and the primary benefit of soft solder is the low temperature used (to prevent heat damage to electronic components and insulation).\n\nSince the joint is produced using a metal with a lower melting temperature than the workpiece, the joint will weaken as the ambient temperature approaches the melting point of the filler metal. For that reason, the higher temperature processes produce joints which are effective at higher temperatures. Brazed connections can be as strong or nearly as strong as the parts they connect,<ref name=Bellman-MelcorInc>[http://www.bellmanmelcor.com/brazing_tips1.htm Brazing tips]</ref><ref name=WallColmonoy>[http://www.wallcolmonoy.com/TechServices/NicrobrazNewsArchives/WCC_Article_Joint_Strength.htm Factors that affect joint strength]</ref> even at elevated temperatures.<ref name=goldbulletin>[http://www.goldbulletin.org/assets/file/goldbulletin/downloads/Colbus_2_7.pdf Properties of Gold-Nickel Alloy Brazed Joints in High Temperature Materials; Prof. Jakob Colbus & Karl Zimmermann.]</ref>\n\n===Silver soldering===\n\"Hard soldering\" or \"silver soldering\" is used to join precious and semi-precious metals such as gold, silver, brass, and copper. The solder is usually referred to as easy, medium, or hard. This refers to its melting temperature, not the strength of the joint. Extra-easy solder contains 56% silver and has a melting point of {{convert|1145|F}}. Extra-hard solder has 80% silver and melts at {{convert|1370|F}}. If multiple joints are needed, then the jeweler will start with hard or extra-hard solder and switch to lower-temperature solders for later joints.\n\nSilver solder is absorbed by the surrounding metal, resulting in a joint that is actually stronger than the metal being joined. The metal being joined must be perfectly flush, as silver solder cannot normally be used as a filler and any gaps will remain.\n\nAnother difference between brazing and soldering is how the solder is applied. In brazing, one generally uses rods that are touched to the joint while being heated. With silver soldering, small pieces of solder wire are placed onto the metal prior to heating. A flux, often made of boric acid and denatured alcohol, is used to keep the metal and solder clean and to prevent the solder from moving before it melts.\n\nWhen silver solder melts, it tends to flow towards the area of greatest heat. Jewelers can somewhat control the direction the solder moves by leading it with a torch; it will even run straight up along a seam.\n\n===Induction soldering===\nInduction soldering uses [[induction heating]] by high-frequency AC current in a surrounding copper coil. This induces currents in the part being soldered, which generates heat because of the higher resistance of a joint versus its surrounding metal ([[resistive heating]]). These copper coils can be shaped to fit the joint more precisely. A filler metal (solder) is placed between the facing surfaces, and this solder melts at a fairly low temperature. Fluxes are commonly used in induction soldering. This technique is particularly suited to continuously soldering, in which case these coils wrap around a cylinder or a pipe that needs to be soldered.\n\nSome metals are easier to solder than others. Copper, silver, and gold are easy. Iron, [[mild steel]] and [[nickel]] are next in difficulty. Because of their thin, strong oxide films, [[stainless steel]] and aluminium are even more difficult to solder. [[Titanium]], [[magnesium]], [[cast iron]]s, some high-carbon [[steel]]s, [[ceramic]]s, and [[graphite]] can be soldered but it involves a process similar to joining carbides: they are first plated with a suitable metallic element that induces interfacial bonding.\n\n==={{anchor|REBALLING|Cold joint}}Electronic components (PCBs)===\n[[File:Soldering a 0805.jpg|thumb|right|Soldering of an SMD capacitor]]\n[[File:Ersin Multicore Solder Tube.jpg|thumb|right|A tube of multicore electronics solder used for manual soldering]]\n[[File:Cold solder joint2.jpg|thumb|An improperly soldered 'cold' joint]]\n[[File:Gebrochene loetstellen.jpg|thumb|Broken solder joints on a [[circuit board]]]]\n\nCurrently, mass-production printed circuit boards (PCBs) are mostly [[wave soldering|wave soldered]] or [[reflow soldering|reflow soldered]], though hand soldering of production electronics is also still standard practice.\n\nIn wave soldering, parts are temporarily kept in place with small dabs of adhesive, then the assembly is passed over flowing solder in a bulk container.  This solder is shaken into waves so the whole PCB is not submerged in solder, but rather touched by these waves. The end result is that solder stays on pins and pads, but not on the PCB itself.\n\nReflow soldering is a process in which a [[solder paste]] (a mixture of prealloyed solder powder and a flux-vehicle that has a peanut butter-like consistency<ref name=\"indiumcorporation\"/>) is used to stick the components to their attachment pads, after which the assembly is heated by an infrared lamp, a hot air pencil, or, more commonly, by passing it through a carefully controlled oven.\n\nSince different components can be best assembled by different techniques, it is common to use two or more processes for a given PCB. For example, [[Surface-mount technology|surface mounted]] parts may be reflow soldered first, with a wave soldering process for the [[Through-hole technology|through-hole]] mounted components coming next, and bulkier parts hand-soldered last.\n\nFor hand soldering, the heat source tool should be selected to provide adequate heat for the size of joint to be completed. A 100 watt soldering iron may provide too much heat for printed circuit boards, while a 25 watt iron will not provide enough heat for large electrical connectors, joining copper roof flashing, or large stained-glass lead came. Using a tool with too high a temperature can damage sensitive components, but protracted heating by a tool that is too cool or under powered can also cause extensive heat damage.\n\nHand-soldering techniques require a great deal of skill to use on what is known as fine-pitch soldering of [[integrated circuit|chip]] packages. In particular [[ball grid array|ball grid array (BGA)]] devices are notoriously difficult, if not impossible, to rework by hand.\n\nFor attachment of electronic components to a PCB, proper selection and use of flux helps prevent oxidation during soldering, which is essential for good wetting and heat transfer. The soldering iron tip must be clean and pre-tinned with solder to ensure rapid heat transfer. Components which dissipate large amounts of heat during operation are sometimes elevated above the PCB to avoid PCB overheating. After inserting a through-hole mounted component, the excess lead is cut off, leaving a length of about the radius of the pad. Plastic or metal mounting clips or holders may be used with large devices to aid heat dissipation and reduce joint stresses.\n\nA heat sink may be used on the leads of heat sensitive components to reduce heat transfer to the component. This is especially applicable to germanium parts. (Note the heat sink will mean the use of more heat to complete the joint.) If all metal surfaces are not properly fluxed and brought above the melting temperature of the solder in use, the result will be an unreliable \"cold solder joint\".\n\nTo simplify soldering, beginners are usually advised to apply the soldering iron and the solder separately to the joint, rather than the solder being applied direct to the iron. When sufficient solder is applied, the solder wire is removed. When the surfaces are adequately heated, the solder will flow around the joint. The iron is then removed from the joint.\n\nSince non-eutectic solder alloys have a small plastic range, the joint must not be moved until the solder has cooled down through both the liquidus and solidus temperatures. When visually inspected, a good solder joint will appear smooth and shiny, with the outline of the soldered wire clearly visible. A matte gray surface is a good indicator of a joint that was moved during soldering.\n\nOther solder defects can be detected visually as well. Too little solder will result in a dry and unreliable joint; too much solder (the familiar 'solder blob' to beginners) is not necessarily unsound, but tends to mean poor wetting. With some fluxes, flux residue remaining on the joint may need to be removed, using water, alcohol or other solvents compatible with the parts in question.\n\nExcess solder and unconsumed flux and residue is sometimes wiped from the soldering iron tip between joints. The tip of the iron is kept wetted with solder (\"tinned\") when hot to assist soldering, and when hot and cold to minimize oxidation and corrosion of the tip itself.\n\nEnvironmental legislation in many countries, and the whole of the [[European Community]] area (see [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive|RoHS]]), has led to a change in formulation of both solders and fluxes. Water-soluble non-rosin-based fluxes have been increasingly used since the 1980s so that soldered boards can be cleaned with water or water-based cleaners. This eliminates hazardous solvents from the production environment, and from factory effluents.\n\n====Hot-bar reflow====\n''Hot-bar reflow'' is a selective soldering process where two pre-fluxed, solder coated parts are heated with heating element (called a thermode) to a sufficient temperature to melt the solder.\n\nPressure is applied through the whole process (usually 15 s) to ensure that components stay in place during cooling. The heating element is heated and cooled for each connection. Up to 4000 [[Watt|W]] can be used in the heating element allowing fast soldering, good results with connections requiring high energy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unitek Eapro: Electronic Assembly Products|url=http://www.unitekeapro.com/pages.php?id=85|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506083947/http://www.unitekeapro.com/pages.php?id=85 |archivedate = 2008-05-06}}</ref>\n\n====Laser====\n''Laser soldering'' is a technique where a ~30-50 [[Watt|W]] [[laser]] is used to melt and solder an electrical connection joint.

The beam is delivered via an optical fiber to the workpiece, with fiber diameters 800&nbsp;\u00b5m and smaller. Since the beam out of the end of the fiber diverges rapidly, [[lens (optics)|lens]]es are used to create a suitable spot size on the workpiece at a suitable working distance. A wire feeder is used to supply solder.<ref>{{cite web|title=Laser Soldering|url=http://www.ma-info.de/html/laser_soldering.html}} 070927 ma-info.de</ref>\n\nBoth lead-tin and silver-tin material can be soldered. Process recipes will differ depending on the [[alloy]] composition. For soldering 44-pin chip carriers to a board using soldering preforms, power levels were on the order of 10 Watts and solder times approximately 1 second. Low power levels can lead to incomplete wetting and the formation of voids, both of which can weaken the joint.\n\n===Fiber focus infrared soldering===\nFiber focus infrared soldering is technique where many [[infrared]] sources are led through [[optical fiber|fibers]], then focused onto a single spot at which the connection is soldered.<ref name=\"nofiss\">{{cite web|title=NovaBrite RGB Full Color High Power LED Application Note|url=http://www.vincenc.com.tw/download/Full%20color%20%20Hi%20POWER%20LED%20Application%20Note.pdf}} 070927 vincenc.com.tw (mentioned as a technique)</ref>{{Failed verification|date=November 2010}}\n\n===Pipe soldering===<!-- [[Sweat fitting]] redirects here -->\n[[File:Fitting1537.JPG|thumb|210px|Soldered copper pipes]]\n[[File:Weichlot.jpg|thumb|210px|Solder]]\n[[File:Leadfree Cadmium solder.jpg|thumb|210px|Lead-free solder]]\nCopper pipe, or 'tube', is commonly joined by soldering. When applied in a plumbing trade context in the United  States, soldering is often referred to as ''sweating'', and a tubing connection so made is referred to as a ''sweated joint''.\n\nCopper tubing conducts heat away much faster than a conventional hand-held soldering iron or gun can provide, so a [[propane torch]] is most commonly used to deliver the necessary power; for large tubing sizes and fittings a [[MAPP gas|MAPP]]-fueled, [[acetylene]]-fueled, or [[propylene]]-fueled torch is used with atmospheric air as the oxidizer; MAPP/oxygen or acetylene/oxygen are rarely used because the flame temperature is much higher than the melting point of copper. Too much heat destroys the temper of hard-tempered copper tubing, and can burn the flux out of a joint before the solder is added, resulting in a faulty joint. For larger tubing sizes, a torch fitted with various sizes of interchangeable ''swirl tips'' is employed to deliver the needed heating power. Most experienced plumbers seldom use propane fuel.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} In the hands of a skilled [[tradesman]], the hotter flame of acetylene, MAPP, or propylene allows more joints to be completed per hour.\n\nHowever, it is possible to use an electrical tool to solder joints in copper pipe sized from 8mm to 22mm.  For example, the Antex Pipemaster is recommended for use in tight spaces, when [[open flame]]s are hazardous, or by [[do-it-yourself]] users.  The [[pliers]]-like tool uses heated fitted jaws that completely encircle the pipe, allowing a joint to be melted in as little as 10 seconds.<ref name=SPP>{{cite web|title=Pipemaster Soldering Tool|url=http://smartplumbingproducts.com/product/pipemaster-soldering-tool|work=Smart Plumbing Products|publisher=Smart Contractor Products|accessdate=2014-05-20}}</ref>\n\nSolder fittings, also known as ''capillary fittings'', are short sections of smooth pipe designed to slide over the outside of the mating tube, are usually used for copper joints. Commonly used fittings include for straight connectors, reducers, bends, and tees. There are two types of solder fittings: ''end feed fittings'' which contain no solder, and ''[[solder ring fitting]]s'' (also known as Yorkshire fittings), in which there is a ring of solder in a small circular recess inside the fitting.\n\nAs with all solder joints, all parts to be joined must be clean and oxide free. Internal and external wire brushes are available for the common pipe and fitting sizes; [[emery cloth]] and wire-wool are frequently used as well, although metal wool products are discouraged, as they can contain oil, which would contaminate the joint.\n\nBecause of the size of the parts involved, and the high activity and contaminating tendency of the flame, plumbing fluxes are typically much more chemically active, and more acidic, than electronic fluxes. Because plumbing joints may be done at any angle, even upside down, plumbing fluxes are generally formulated as pastes which stay in place better than liquids. Flux should be applied to all surfaces of the joint, inside and out. Flux residues should be removed after the joint is complete or they can, eventually, erode through the copper substrates and cause failure of the joint.\n\nMany plumbing solder formulations are available, with different characteristics, such as higher or lower melting temperature, depending on the specific requirements of the job. Building codes currently almost universally require the use of lead-free solder for potable water piping, though traditional tin-lead solder is still available. Studies have shown that lead-soldered plumbing pipes can result in elevated levels of lead in drinking water.<ref>[http://www.plumbingpages.com/featurepages/Pipeworkfluxsolder.cfm]</ref><ref>http://www.askdrsears.com/html/10/T110211.asp</ref>\n\nSince copper pipe quickly conducts heat away from a joint, great care must be taken to ensure that the joint is properly heated through to obtain a good bond. After the joint is properly cleaned, fluxed and fitted, the torch flame is applied to the thickest part of the joint, typically the fitting with the pipe inside it, with the solder applied at the gap between the tube and the fitting. When all the parts are heated through, the solder will melt and flow into the joint by capillary action. The torch may need to be moved around the joint to ensure all areas are wetted out. However, the installer must take care to not overheat the areas being soldered. If the tube begins to discolor it means that the tube has been over-heated and is beginning to oxidize, stopping the flow of the solder and causing the soldered joint not to seal properly. Before oxidation the molten solder will follow the heat of the torch around the joint. When the joint is properly wetted out, the solder and then the heat are removed, and while the joint is still very hot, it is usually wiped with a dry rag. This removes excess solder as well as flux residue before it cools down and hardens. With a solder ring joint, the joint is heated until a ring of molten solder is visible around the edge of the fitting and allowed to cool.\n\nOf the three methods of connecting copper tubing, solder connections require the most skill, but soldering copper is a very reliable process, provided some basic conditions are provided:\n\n* The tubing and fittings must be cleaned to bare metal with no tarnish\n* Any pressure which is formed by heating of the tubing must have an outlet\n* The joint must be dry (which can be challenging when repairing water pipes)\n\nCopper is only one material that is joined in this manner. Brass fittings are often used for valves or as a connection fitting between copper and other metals. Brass piping is soldered in this manner in the making of [[brass instruments]] and some [[woodwind]] (saxophone and flute) musical instruments\n\n===Mechanical and aluminium soldering===\nA number of solder materials, primarily [[zinc]] alloys, are used for soldering aluminium metal and alloys and to some lesser extent steel and zinc. This mechanical soldering is similar to a low temperature brazing operation, in that the mechanical characteristics of the joint are reasonably good and it can be used for structural repairs of those materials.\n\nThe [[American welding society]] defines brazing as using filler metals with melting points over {{convert|450|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} \u2014 or, by the traditional definition in the United States, above {{convert|800|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. Aluminium soldering alloys generally have melting temperatures around {{convert|730|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"alumaloy\">[http://www.alumaloy.net/alumaloy1.htm Alumaloy], accessed 2009-04-03</ref> This soldering / brazing operation can use a propane torch heat source.<ref name=\"alumiweld\">[http://www.alumiweld.com/faq.html Alumiweld FAQ], accessed 2009-04-03</ref>\n\nThese materials are often advertised as \"aluminium welding\", but the process does not involve melting the base metal, and therefore is not properly a weld.\n\n[[United States Military Standard]] or MIL-SPEC specification MIL-R-4208 defines one standard for these zinc-based brazing/soldering alloys.<ref name=\"MIL-R-4208\">[http://www.tpub.com/content/logistics/34/39/10/00-580-0585.htm MIL-R-4208], accessed 2009-04-03</ref> A number of products meet this specification.<ref name=\"alumiweld\"/><ref name=\"3in1\">[http://www.aladdin3in1.com/catalog.htm Aladdin 3-in-1], accessed 2009-04-03</ref><ref name=\"HTS-2000\">[http://www.aluminumrepair.com/more_info.asp HTS-2000], accessed 2009-03-09</ref> or very similar performance standards.<ref name=\"alumaloy\"/>\n\n'''Resistance soldering''' is soldering in which the heat required to flow the solder is created by passing an electric current through the solder. When current is conducted through a resistive material a certain level of heat is generated. By regulating the amount of current conducted and the level of resistance encountered, the amount of heat produced can be predetermined and controlled.\n\nElectrical resistance (usually described as a material's opposition to the flow of an electric current) is used to convert electric energy into thermal energy as an electric current (I) conducted through a material with resistance (R) releases power (P) equal to: P = I\u00b2 R, where P is the power measured in watts, I is the current measured in amps and R is the resistance measured in ohms.\n\n===Resistance soldering===\nResistance soldering is unlike using a conduction iron, where heat is produced within an element and then passed through a thermally conductive tip into the joint area. A cold soldering iron requires time to reach working temperature and must be kept hot between solder joints. Thermal transfer may be inhibited if the tip is not kept properly wetted during use. With resistance soldering an intense heat can be rapidly developed directly within the joint area and in a tightly controlled manner. This allows a faster ramp up to the required solder melt temperature and minimizes thermal travel away from the solder joint, which helps to minimize the potential for thermal damage to materials or components in the surrounding area. Heat is only produced while each joint is being made, making resistance soldering more energy efficient. Resistance soldering equipment, unlike conduction irons, can be used for difficult soldering and brazing applications where significantly higher temperatures may be required. This makes resistance comparable to flame soldering in some situations. When the required temperature can be achieved by either flame or resistance methods the resistance heat is more localized because of direct contact, whereas the flame will spread thus heating a potentially larger area.\n\n===Stained glass soldering===\nHistorically, [[stained glass]] soldering tips were copper, heated by being placed in a [[charcoal]]-burning [[brazier]]. Multiple tips were used; when one tip cooled down from use, it was placed back in the brazier of charcoal and the next tip was used.\n\nMore recently, electrically heated soldering irons are used. These are heated by a coil or ceramic heating element inside the tip of the iron. Different power ratings are available, and temperature can be controlled electronically. These characteristics allow longer beads to be run without interrupting the work to change tips. Soldering irons designed for electronic use are often effective though they are sometimes underpowered for the heavy copper and lead came used in stained glass work.\nOleic acid is the classic flux material that has been used to improve solderability.\n\nTiffany-type stained glass is made by gluing copper foil around the edges of the pieces of glass and then soldering them together. This method makes it possible to create three-dimensional stained glass pieces.\n\n==Solderability==\n{{Main|Solderability}}\nThe solderability of a substrate is a measure of the ease with which a soldered joint can be made to that material.\n\n==Desoldering and resoldering==\n{{main|Desoldering}}\nUsed solder contains some of the dissolved base metals and is unsuitable for reuse in making new joints. Once the solder's capacity for the base metal has been achieved it will no longer properly bond with the base metal, usually resulting in a brittle cold solder joint with a crystalline appearance.\n\nIt is good practice to remove solder from a joint prior to resoldering\u2014[[desoldering braid]]s or vacuum desoldering equipment ([[solder sucker]]s) can be used. Desoldering wicks contain plenty of flux that will lift the contamination from the copper trace and any device leads that are present. This will leave a bright, shiny, clean junction to be resoldered.\n\nThe lower melting point of solder means it can be melted away from the base metal, leaving it mostly intact, though the outer layer will be \"tinned\" with solder. Flux will remain which can easily be removed by abrasive or chemical processes. This tinned layer will allow solder to flow into a new joint, resulting in a new joint, as well as making the new solder flow very quickly and easily.\n\n== Lead-free electronic soldering ==\nMore recently environmental legislation has specifically targeted the wide use of lead in the electronics industry. The RoHS directives in Europe required many new electronic circuit boards to be lead free by 1 July 2006, mostly in the consumer goods industry, but in some others as well. In Japan lead was phased out prior to legislation by manufacturers due to the additional expense in recycling products containing lead.<ref name=\"sol1\"/> However, even without the presence of lead, soldering can release fumes that are harmful and/or toxic to humans. It is highly recommended to use a device that can remove the fumes from the work area either by ventilating outside or filtering the air.<ref name=\"sol2\">[http://www.sentryair.com/solder-fumes.htm Hazards of Soldering Fumes]</ref>\n\nIt is a common misconception that lead free soldering requires higher soldering temperatures than lead/tin solder; the wetting temperature in lead/tin solder is higher than the melting point and is the controlling factor - Wave soldering can proceed at the same temperature as previous lead/tin soldering.<ref name=\"sol1\">[http://www.dklmetals.co.uk/PDF%20Files/Factorfiction.pdf FACT AND FICTION IN LEAD FREE SOLDERING] from ''www.dkmetals.co.uk''</ref> Nevertheless, many new technical challenges have arisen with this endeavor; to reduce the melting point of tin-based solder alloys various new alloys have had to be researched, with additives of copper, silver, bismuth as typical minor additives to reduce melting point and control other properties, additionally tin is a more corrosive metal, and can eventually lead to the failure of solder baths etc.<ref name=\"sol1\"/>\n\nLead-free construction has also extended to components, pins, and connectors. Most of these pins used copper frames, and either lead, tin, gold or other finishes. Tin finishes are the most popular of lead-free finishes. Nevertheless, this brings up the issue of how to deal with [[whisker (metallurgy)|tin whiskers]]. The current movement brings the electronics industry back to the problems solved in the 1960s by adding lead. [[JEDEC]] has created a classification system to help lead-free electronic manufacturers decide what provisions to take against whiskers, depending upon their application.\n\n==Soldering defects==\nIn the joining of copper tube, failure to properly heat and fill a joint may lead to a 'void' being formed. This is usually a result of improper placement of the flame. If the heat of the flame is not directed at the back of the fitting cup, and the solder wire applied degrees{{howmany|date=September 2016}} opposite the flame, then solder will quickly fill the opening of the fitting, trapping some flux inside the joint. This bubble of trapped flux is the void; an area inside a soldered joint where solder is unable to completely fill the fittings' cup, because flux has become sealed inside the joint, preventing solder from occupying that space.\n\n===Electronics===\nVarious problems may arise in the soldering process which lead to joints which are nonfunctional either immediately or after a period of use.\n\nThe most common defect when hand-soldering results from the parts being joined not exceeding the solder's liquidus temperature, resulting in a \"cold solder\" joint. This is usually the result of the soldering iron being used to heat the solder directly, rather than the parts themselves. Properly done, the iron heats the parts to be connected, which in turn melt the solder, guaranteeing adequate heat in the joined parts for thorough wetting. In electronic hand soldering the flux is embedded in the solder. Therefore, heating the solder first may cause the flux to evaporate before it cleans the surfaces being soldered. A cold-soldered joint may not conduct at all, or may conduct only intermittently. Cold-soldered joints also happen in mass production, and are a common cause of equipment which passes testing, but malfunctions after sometimes years of operation.  A \"dry joint\" occurs when the cooling solder is moved, and often occurs because the joint moves when the soldering iron is removed from the joint.\n\nAn improperly selected or applied flux can cause joint failure. If not properly cleaned, a flux may corrode the joint and cause eventual joint failure. Without flux the joint may not be clean, or may be oxidized, resulting in an unsound joint.\n\nIn electronics non-corrosive fluxes are often used. Therefore, cleaning flux off may merely be a matter of aesthetics or to make visual inspection of joints easier in specialised 'mission critical' applications such as medical devices, military and aerospace. For satellites, this will also reduce weight, slightly but usefully. In high humidity, even non-corrosive flux might remain slightly active, therefore the flux may be removed to reduce corrosion over time. In some applications, the PCB might also be coated in some form of protective material such as a [[lacquer]] to protect it and exposed solder joints from the environment.\n\nMovement of metals being soldered before the solder has cooled will cause a highly unreliable cracked joint. In electronics soldering terminology this is known as a 'dry' joint. It has a characteristically dull or grainy appearance immediately after the joint is made, rather than being smooth, bright and shiny. This appearance is caused by crystallization of the liquid solder. A dry joint is weak mechanically and a poor conductor electrically.\n\nIn general a good-looking soldered joint ''is'' a good joint. As mentioned, it should be smooth, bright, and shiny. If the joint has lumps or balls of otherwise shiny solder the metal has not 'wetted' properly. Not being bright and shiny suggests a weak 'dry' joint. However, technicians trying to apply this guideline when using lead-free solder formulations may experience frustration, because these types of solders readily cool to a dull surface even if the joint is good. The solder looks shiny while molten, and suddenly hazes over as it solidifies even though it has not been disturbed during cooling.\n\nIn electronics a '[[wikt:concave|concave]]' fillet is ideal. This indicates good wetting and minimal use of solder (therefore minimal ''heating'' of heat sensitive components). A joint may be good, but if a large amount of unnecessary solder is used then more heating is obviously required. Excessive heating of a PCB may result in 'delamination' - the copper track may actually lift off the board, particularly on single sided PCBs without [[Through-hole technology|through hole plating]].\n\n==Tools==\nIn principle any type of soldering tool can carry out any work using solder at temperatures it can generate. In practice different tools are more suitable for different applications.\n\nHand-soldering tools widely used for electronics work include the electric soldering iron, which can be fitted with a variety of tips ranging from blunt to very fine, to chisel heads for hot-cutting plastics rather than soldering. The simplest irons do not have temperature regulation; small irons rapidly cool when used to solder to, say, a metal chassis, while large irons have tips too cumbersome for working on PCBs and similar fine work. Temperature-controlled irons have a reserve of power and can maintain temperature over a wide range of work. The [[soldering gun]] heats faster but has a larger and heavier body. Gas-powered irons using a catalytic tip to heat a bit, without flame, are used for portable applications. Hot-air guns and pencils allow [[rework (electronics)|rework]] of component packages which cannot easily be performed with electric irons and guns.\n\nFor non-electronic applications soldering torches use a flame rather than a soldering tip to heat solder. Soldering torches are often powered by butane<ref>[http://www.toolingu.com/definition-660130-28677-soldering-torch.html What is the definition of soldering torch?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and are available in sizes ranging from very small butane/oxygen units suitable for very fine but high-temperature jewelry work, to full-size oxy-fuel torches suitable for much larger work such as copper piping. Common multipurpose propane torches, the same kind used for heat-stripping paint and thawing pipes, can be used for soldering pipes and other fairly large objects either with or without a soldering tip attachment; pipes are generally soldered with a torch by directly applying the open flame.\n\nA soldering copper is a tool with a large copper head and a long handle which is heated in a [[blacksmith]]'s forge fire and used to apply heat to [[sheet metal]] for soldering. Typical soldering coppers have heads weighing between one and four pounds. The head provides a large [[thermal mass]] to store enough heat for soldering large areas before needing re-heating in the fire; the larger the head, the longer the working time. Historically, soldering coppers were standard tools used in auto bodywork, although [[body solder]] has been mostly superseded by [[spot welding]] for mechanical connection, and non-metallic fillers for contouring.\n\n[[Toaster oven#Toaster ovens|Toaster ovens]] and hand held infrared lights have been used by hobbyists to replicate production soldering processes on a much smaller scale.\n\nBristle brushes are usually used to apply plumbing paste flux. For electronic work, flux-core solder is generally used, but additional flux may be used from a [[flux pen]] or dispensed from a small bottle with a syringe-like needle.\n\n[[Wire brush]], [[wire wool]] and emery cloth are commonly used to prepare plumbing joints for connection. Electronic joints are usually made between surfaces that have been tinned and rarely require mechanical cleaning, though tarnished component leads and copper traces with a dark layer of oxide passivation (due to aging), as on a new prototyping board that has been on the shelf for about a year or more, may need to be mechanically cleaned.\n\nSome fluxes for electronics are designed to be stable and inactive when cool and do not need to be cleaned off, though they still can be if desired, while other fluxes are acidic and must be removed after soldering to prevent corrosion of the circuits. For PCB assembly and rework, either an alcohol or acetone is commonly used with cotton swabs or bristle brushes to remove flux residue after soldering. A heavy rag is usually used to remove flux from a plumbing joint before it cools and hardens. A fiberglass brush can also be used.\n\nA [[heat sink]], such as a crocodile clip, can be used to prevent damaging heat-sensitive components while hand-soldering. The heat sink limits the temperature of the component body by absorbing and dissipating heat (reducing the thermal resistance between the component and the air), while the thermal resistance of the leads maintains the temperature difference between the part of the leads being soldered and the component body so that the leads become hot enough to melt the solder while the component body remains cooler.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Desoldering]]\n*[[Dip soldering]]\n*[[Solder mask]]\n*[[Electronics_Technician_(United_States_Navy)|Electronics Technician]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikibooks|Practical Electronics/Soldering}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Brazing and Soldering}}\n* [http://www.epemag.wimborne.co.uk/desolderpix.htm Desoldering guide]\n* [http://vega.org.uk/video/programme/166 A short video explanation of how solder works]\n* A useful table of various solder alloy liquidus temperatures can be found in an [http://www.empf.org/empfasis/jan05/lfaudit.htm article hosted at the EMPF].\n\n{{Metalworking navbox|formopen}}\n\n[[Category:Brazing and soldering| ]]\n[[Category:Electronics manufacturing]]\n[[Category:Laser applications]]<!-- For laser soldering -->\n[[Category:Metalworking]]"}]}}}}
