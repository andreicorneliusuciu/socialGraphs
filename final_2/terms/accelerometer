For example, an accelerometer at rest on the surface of the Earth will measure an acceleration due to Earth's gravity, straight upwards (by definition) of g \u2248 9.81&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>. By contrast, accelerometers in [[free fall]] (falling toward the center of the Earth at a rate of about 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>) will measure zero.\n\nAccelerometers have multiple applications in industry and science. Highly sensitive accelerometers are components of [[inertial navigation system]]s for aircraft and missiles. Accelerometers are used to detect and monitor vibration in rotating machinery. Accelerometers are used in [[tablet computer]]s and digital cameras so that images on screens are always displayed upright. Accelerometers are used in drones for flight stabilisation. Coordinated accelerometers can be used to measure differences in proper acceleration, particularly gravity, over their separation in space; i.e., gradient of the [[gravitational field]]. This [[gravity gradiometry]] is useful because absolute gravity is a weak effect and depends on local density of the Earth which is quite variable.\n\nSingle- and multi-axis models of accelerometer are available to detect magnitude and direction of the proper acceleration, as a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity, and can be used to sense orientation (because direction of weight changes), coordinate acceleration, vibration, [[shock indicator|shock]], and falling in a resistive medium (a case where the proper acceleration changes, since it starts at zero, then increases). [[Microelectromechanical systems|Micromachined]] accelerometers are increasingly present in portable electronic devices and video game controllers, to detect the position of the device or provide for game input.\n\n==Physical principles==\n\nAn accelerometer measures [[proper acceleration]], which is the acceleration it experiences relative to freefall and is the acceleration felt by people and objects. Put another way, at any point in spacetime the [[equivalence principle]] guarantees the existence of a local [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial frame]], and an accelerometer measures the acceleration relative to that frame.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Einstein| first = Albert| title = Relativity: The Special and General Theory| publisher=Henry Holt| year = 1920| location = New York| page = 168| chapter = 20| url = http://www.bartleby.com/173/20.html| isbn = 1-58734-092-5}}</ref> Such accelerations are popularly denoted [[g-force]]; i.e., in comparison to [[standard gravity]].\n\nAn accelerometer at rest relative to the Earth's surface will indicate approximately 1&nbsp;g ''upwards'', because any point on the Earth's surface is accelerating upwards relative to the local inertial frame (the frame of a freely falling object near the surface). To obtain the acceleration due to motion with respect to the Earth, this \"gravity offset\" must be subtracted and corrections made for effects caused by the Earth's rotation relative to the inertial frame.\n\nThe reason for the appearance of a gravitational offset is Einstein's [[equivalence principle]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Penrose|first=Roger|title=The Road to Reality|origyear=2004|year=2005|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|pages=393\u2013394|chapter=17.4 The Principle of Equivalence|isbn=0-470-08578-9}}</ref> which states that the effects of gravity on an object are indistinguishable from acceleration. When held fixed in a gravitational field by, for example, applying a ground reaction force or an equivalent upward thrust, the reference frame for an accelerometer (its own casing) accelerates upwards with respect to a free-falling reference frame. The effects of this acceleration are indistinguishable from any other acceleration experienced by the instrument, so that an accelerometer cannot detect the difference between sitting in a rocket on the launch pad, and being in the same rocket in deep space while it uses its engines to accelerate at 1&nbsp;g. For similar reasons, an accelerometer will read ''zero'' during any type of [[free fall]]. This includes use in a coasting spaceship in deep space far from any mass, a spaceship orbiting the Earth, an airplane in a parabolic \"zero-g\" arc, or any free-fall in vacuum. Another example is free-fall at a sufficiently high altitude that atmospheric effects can be neglected.\n\nHowever this does not include a (non-free) fall in which air resistance produces drag forces that reduce the acceleration, until constant [[terminal velocity]] is reached. At terminal velocity the accelerometer will indicate 1 g acceleration upwards. For the same reason a [[Parachuting|skydiver]], upon reaching terminal velocity, does not feel as though he or she were in \"free-fall\", but rather experiences a feeling similar to being supported (at 1 g) on a \"bed\" of uprushing air.\n\nAcceleration is quantified in the [[International System of Units|SI]] unit [[metre per second squared|metres per second per second]] (m/s<sup>2</sup>), in the [[centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system of units|cgs]] unit [[gal (unit)|gal]] (Gal), or popularly in terms of [[standard gravity]] (''g'').\n\nFor the practical purpose of finding the acceleration of objects with respect to the Earth, such as for use in an [[inertial navigation system]], a knowledge of local gravity is required. This can be obtained either by calibrating the device at rest,<ref name=\"analog.com\">{{cite web|first=James |last=Doscher |url=http://www.analog.com/en/technical-library/faqs/design-center/faqs/CU_faq_MEMs/resources/fca.html |accessdate=2008-12-23 |title=Accelerometer Design and Applications |publisher=[[Analog Devices]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081213001559/http://www.analog.com:80/en/technical-library/faqs/design-center/faqs/CU_faq_MEMs/resources/fca.html |archivedate=13 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> or from a known model of gravity at the approximate current position.\n\n==Structure==\n\nConceptually, an accelerometer behaves as a damped mass on a spring. When the accelerometer experiences an acceleration, the mass is displaced to the point that the spring is able to accelerate the mass at the same rate as the casing. The displacement is then measured to give the acceleration.\n\nIn commercial devices, [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]], [[Piezoresistive effect|piezoresistive]] and [[Capacitive sensing|capacitive]] components are commonly used to convert the mechanical motion into an electrical signal. Piezoelectric accelerometers rely on piezoceramics (e.g. [[lead zirconate titanate]]) or single crystals (e.g. [[quartz]], [[tourmaline]]). They are unmatched in terms of their upper frequency range, low packaged weight and high temperature range. Piezoresistive accelerometers are preferred in high shock applications. Capacitive accelerometers typically use a silicon micro-machined sensing element. Their performance is superior in the low frequency range and they can be operated in [[Servomechanism|servo]] mode to achieve high stability and linearity.\n\nModern accelerometers are often small ''micro electro-mechanical systems'' ([[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]]), and are indeed the simplest MEMS devices possible, consisting of little more than a [[cantilever|cantilever beam]] with a [[proof mass]] (also known as ''seismic mass''). Damping results from the residual gas sealed in the device. As long as the [[Q factor|Q-factor]] is not too low, damping does not result in a lower sensitivity.\n\nUnder the influence of external accelerations the proof mass deflects from its neutral position.  This deflection is measured in an analog or digital manner. Most commonly, the capacitance between a set of fixed beams and a set of beams attached to the proof mass is measured. This method is simple, reliable, and inexpensive. Integrating [[Piezoresistive effect|piezoresistors]] in the springs to detect spring deformation, and thus deflection, is a good alternative, although a few more process steps are needed during the fabrication sequence. For very high sensitivities [[Quantum tunnelling|quantum tunneling]] is also used; this requires a dedicated process making it very expensive. Optical measurement has been demonstrated on laboratory scale.\n\nAnother, far less common, type of MEMS-based accelerometer contains a small heater at the bottom of a very small dome, which heats the air inside the dome to cause it to rise. A thermocouple on the dome determines where the heated air reaches the dome and the deflection off the center is a measure of the acceleration applied to the sensor.\n\nMost micromechanical accelerometers operate ''in-plane'', that is, they are designed to be sensitive only to a direction in the plane of the [[die (manufacturing)|die]]. By integrating two devices perpendicularly on a single die a two-axis accelerometer can be made. By adding another ''out-of-plane'' device three axes can be measured. Such a combination may have much lower misalignment error than three discrete models combined after packaging.\n\nMicromechanical accelerometers are available in a wide variety of measuring ranges, reaching up to thousands of ''g''{{'}}s. The designer must make a compromise between sensitivity and the maximum acceleration that can be measured.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Engineering===\n\nAccelerometers can be used to measure vehicle acceleration.\nAccelerometers can be used to measure [[vibration]] on cars, machines, buildings, process control systems and safety installations. They can also be used to measure seismic activity, inclination, machine vibration, dynamic distance and speed with or without the influence of gravity. Applications for accelerometers that measure gravity, wherein an accelerometer is specifically configured for use in [[gravimetry]], are called [[gravimeter]]s.\n\nNotebook computers equipped with accelerometers can contribute to the ''[[Quake-Catcher Network]]'' (QCN), a [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing|BOINC project]] aimed at scientific research of earthquakes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Quake-Catcher Network \u2013 Downloads |url=http://qcn.stanford.edu/downloads/index.php |publisher=Quake-Catcher Network |quote=If you have a Mac laptop (2006 or later), a Thinkpad (2003 or later), or a desktop with a USB sensor, you can download software to turn your computer into a Quake-Catcher Sensor |accessdate=15 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Biology===\n\nAccelerometers are also increasingly used in the biological sciences. High frequency recordings of bi-axial<ref>Yoda et al.

Furthermore, recordings of acceleration allow researchers to quantify the rate at which an animal is expending energy in the wild, by either determination of limb-stroke frequency<ref>Kawabe et al. (2003) ''Fisheries Science'' 69 (5):959 \u2013 965</ref> or measures such as overall dynamic body acceleration<ref>Wilson et al. (2006) ''Journal of Animal Ecology'':75 (5):1081 \u2013 1090</ref> Such approaches have mostly been adopted by marine scientists due to an inability to study animals in the wild using visual observations, however an increasing number of terrestrial biologists are adopting similar approaches. This device can be connected to an amplifier to amplify the signal.\n\n===Industry===\n{{Main|Condition monitoring}}\n\nAccelerometers are also used for machinery health monitoring to report the vibration and its changes in time of shafts at the bearings of rotating equipment such as turbines, [[pump]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilcoxon.com/knowdesk/Know%20the%20health%20of%20your%20pumps.pdf|title=''Know the Age of your Pumps''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114125302/http://www.wilcoxon.com/knowdesk/Know%20the%20health%20of%20your%20pumps.pdf|deadurl=no|archivedate=11 September 2014|last1=Klubnik|first1=Renard|last2=Sullivan|first2=Ron}}</ref> fans,<ref>{{cite web|title=Guidance for mounting 4-20 mA vibration sensors on fans |accessdate=11 September 2014 |deadurl=no |url=http://www.wilcoxon.com/knowdesk/Guidance%20for%20mounting%204-20mA%20sensors%20on%20fans.pdf |archivedate=11 September 2014 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6SWMBOMKF?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wilcoxon.com%2Fknowdesk%2FGuidance%2520for%2520mounting%25204-20mA%2520sensors%2520on%2520fans.pdf |author=Wilcoxon Research |df= }}</ref> rollers,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wilcoxon.com/knowdesk/Vibration%20monitoring%20of%20slow%20speed%20rollers.pdf|title=Know the Health of your Pumps|last1=Klubnik|last2=Sullivan|first1=Renard|first2=Ron|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114125302/http://www.wilcoxon.com/knowdesk/Know%20the%20health%20of%20your%20pumps.pdf|archivedate=11 September 2014|accessdate=11 September 2014}}</ref> [[Gas compressor|compressor]]s,<ref name=\"web._\">\n{{Cite web\n |date=14 November 2014\n |title=Low Frequency Vibration Measurements on a Compressor Gear Set \n |work=wilcoxon research\n |archivedate=14 November 2013\n |accessdate=2014-09-11\n |url=http://www.wilcoxon.com/knowdesk/LF%20VM%20on%20compressor%20gear%20set.pdf\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114125343/http://www.wilcoxon.com/knowdesk/LF%20VM%20on%20compressor%20gear%20set.pdf\n |deadurl=no\n |quote =The gear set on a critical turbo-compressor was monitored with a standard industrial accelerometer at very low frequencies...\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilcoxon.com/knowdesk/gear.pdf|title=Gearbox tutorial|publisher=Wilcoxon Research|date=11 September 2014|archivedate=11 September 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114125238/http://www.wilcoxon.com/knowdesk/gear.pdf|deadurl=no}}</ref> or bearing fault<ref>{{Cite web | title = Bearing Failure: Causes and Cures Bearing Failure: Causes and Cures|work=wilcoxon.com|accessdate = 2014-09-11 | archivedate= 12 September 2014 | deadurl= no | archiveurl=http://www.wilcoxon.com/knowdesk/bearing.pdf | url = http://www.wilcoxon.com/knowdesk/bearing.pdf}}</ref>\nwhich, if not attended to promptly, can lead to costly repairs. Accelerometer vibration data allows the user to monitor machines and detect these faults before the rotating equipment fails completely.\n\n===Building and structural monitoring===\n\nAccelerometers are used to measure the motion and vibration of a structure that is exposed to dynamic loads.<ref>O. Sircovich Saar \"Dynamics in the Practice of Structural Design\" 2006 WIT Press ISBN 1-84564-161-2</ref> Dynamic loads originate from a variety of sources including:\n\n* Human activities \u2013 walking, running, dancing or skipping\n* Working machines \u2013 inside a building or in the surrounding area\n* Construction work \u2013 driving piles, demolition, drilling and excavating\n* Moving loads on bridges\n* Vehicle collisions\n* Impact loads \u2013 falling debris\n* Concussion loads \u2013 internal and external explosions\n* Collapse of structural elements\n* Wind loads and wind gusts\n* Air blast pressure\n* Loss of support because of ground failure\n* Earthquakes and aftershocks\n\nUnder structural applications, measuring and recording how a structure dynamically responds to these inputs is critical for assessing the safety and viability of a structure. This type of monitoring is called Health Monitoring, which usually involves other types of instruments, such as displacement sensors -Potentiometers, LVDTs, etc.- deformation sensors -Strain Gauges, Extensometers-, load sensors -Load Cells, Piezo-Electric Sensors- among others.\n\n===Medical applications===\n\nZoll's [[Automated external defibrillator|AED]] Plus uses CPR-D\u2022padz which contain an accelerometer to measure the depth of CPR chest compressions.\n\nWithin the last several years, several companies have produced and marketed sports watches for runners that include [[Inertial footpod|footpods]], containing accelerometers to help determine the speed and distance for the runner wearing the unit.\n\nIn Belgium, accelerometer-based step counters are promoted by the government to encourage people to walk a few thousand steps each day.\n\nHerman Digital Trainer uses accelerometers to measure strike force in physical training.<ref>The Contender 3 Episode 1 SPARQ testing ESPN</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goherman.com/martialarts.aspx|title=Welcome to GoHerman.com innovator of interactive personal training for fitness, \u2013 MARTIAL ARTS & MMA|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested to build [[US football|football]] helmets with accelerometers in order to measure the impact of head collisions.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-01/nfl-test-helmets-impact-sensing-accelerometers-concussion-analysis|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912010842/http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-01/nfl-test-helmets-impact-sensing-accelerometers-concussion-analysis|title=NFL Testing Helmets With Impact-Sensing Accelerometers for Concussion Analysis|deadurl=no|archivedate=12 September 2014|first1=Dan|last1=Nosovitz|journal=Popular Science}}</ref>\n\nAccelerometers have been used to calculate gait parameters, such as stance and swing phase.

Other terms used to refer to inertial navigation systems or closely related devices include inertial guidance system, inertial reference platform, and many other variations.\n\nAn accelerometer alone is unsuitable to determine changes in altitude over distances where the vertical decrease of gravity is significant, such as for aircraft and rockets. In the presence of a gravitational gradient, the calibration and data reduction process is numerically unstable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yarchive.net/air/airliners/ins_novert.html|title='&#39;Vertical Speed Measurement'&#39;, by Ed Hahn in sci.aeronautics.airliners, 1996-11-22|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{US patent reference | number = 6640165 | y = 2003 | m = 10 | d = 28 | inventor = Hayward, Kirk W. and Stephenson, Larry G. | title = Method and system of determining altitude of flying object}}</ref>\n\n===Transport===\n\nAccelerometers are used to detect [[Apsis|apogee]] in both professional<ref>{{cite web|url=http://westrocketry.com/articles/DualDeploy/DualDeployment.html|title=Dual Deployment|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref> and in amateur<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.picoalt.com/|title=PICO altimeter|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref> rocketry.\n\nAccelerometers are also being used in Intelligent Compaction rollers.

In this case the accelerometers are used to detect the rapid negative acceleration of the vehicle to determine when a collision has occurred and the severity of the collision. Another common automotive use is in [[electronic stability control]] systems, which use a lateral accelerometer to measure cornering forces. The widespread use of accelerometers in the automotive industry has [[Economies of scale|pushed their cost down]] dramatically.<ref>{{cite conference|url=http://mafija.fmf.uni-lj.si/seminar/files/2007_2008/MEMS_accelerometers-koncna.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611054427/http://mafija.fmf.uni-lj.si/seminar/files/2007_2008/MEMS_accelerometers-koncna.pdf|archivedate=11 June 2014|deadurl=no|title=MEMS ACCELEROMETERS|last=Andreja\u0161ic|first=Matej|at=University of Ljubljana|date=March 2008}}</ref> Another automotive application is the monitoring of [[noise, vibration, and harshness]] (NVH), conditions that cause discomfort for drivers and passengers and may also be indicators of mechanical faults.\n\n[[Tilting train]]s use accelerometers and gyroscopes to calculate the required tilt.<ref>[http://www.memagazine.org/backissues/membersonly/june98/features/tilting/tilting.html Tilting trains shorten transit time] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604063917/http://www.memagazine.org/backissues/membersonly/june98/features/tilting/tilting.html |date=June 4, 2011 }}.

It can then apply safety measures such as parking the head of a [[hard disk]] to prevent a [[head crash]] and resulting data loss upon impact. This device is included in the many common computer and consumer electronic products that are produced by a variety of manufacturers. It is also used in some [[data logger]]s to monitor handling operations for [[shipping container]]s. The length of time in free fall is used to calculate the height of drop and to estimate the shock to the package.\n\n====Motion input====\n\nSome [[smartphone]]s, digital audio players and [[personal digital assistant]]s contain accelerometers for user interface control; often the accelerometer is used to present [[Page orientation|landscape or portrait views]] of the device's screen, based on the way the device is being held. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] has included an accelerometer in every generation of [[iPhone]], [[iPad]], and [[iPod Touch|iPod touch]], as well as in every [[iPod Nano|iPod nano]] since the 4th generation. Along with orientation view adjustment, accelerometers in mobile devices can also be used as [[pedometer]]s, in conjunction with specialized [[Mobile app|applications]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/20/technology/personaltech/these-apps-are-made-for-walking.html|title=These Apps Are Made For Walking - NYTimes.com|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Advanced Automatic Collision Notification|Automatic Collision Notification]] (ACN) systems also use accelerometers in a system to call for help in event of a vehicle crash. Prominent ACN systems include [[OnStar]] AACN service, [[Ford Sync#911 Assist|Ford Link's 911 Assist]], [[Safety Connect|Toyota's Safety Connect]], [[Lexus Link]], or [[BMW Assist]]. Many accelerometer-equipped smartphones also have ACN software available for download. ACN systems are activated by detecting crash-strength accelerations.\n\nAccelerometers are used in vehicle [[Electronic stability control]] systems to measure the vehicle's actual movement. A computer compares the vehicle's actual movement to the driver's steering and throttle input. The stability control computer can selectively brake individual wheels and/or reduce engine power to minimize the difference between driver input and the vehicle's actual movement. This can help prevent the vehicle from spinning or rolling over.\n\nSome [[pedometer]]s use an accelerometer to more accurately measure the number of steps taken and distance traveled than a mechanical sensor can provide.\n\nNintendo's [[Wii]] video game console uses a controller called a [[Wii Remote]] that contains a three-axis accelerometer and was designed primarily for motion input. Users also have the option of buying an additional motion-sensitive attachment, the [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk]], so that motion input could be recorded from both of the user's hands independently. Is also used on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] system.\n\nThe Sony [[PlayStation 3]] uses the [[DualShock#DualShock 3|DualShock 3]] remote which uses a three axis accelerometer that can be used to make steering more realistic in racing games, such as ''[[MotorStorm]]'' and ''[[Burnout Paradise]]''.\n\nThe [[Nokia 5500 Sport|Nokia 5500]] sport features a 3D accelerometer that can be accessed from software. It is used for step recognition (counting) in a sport application, and for tap gesture recognition in the user interface. Tap gestures can be used for controlling the music player and the sport application, for example to change to next song by tapping through clothing when the device is in a pocket. Other uses for accelerometer in [[Nokia]] phones include [[Pedometer]] functionality in [[Nokia Sports Tracker]]. Some other devices provide the tilt sensing feature with a cheaper component, which is not a true accelerometer.\n\nSleep phase [[alarm clock]]s use accelerometric sensors to detect movement of a sleeper, so that it can wake the person when he/she is not in REM phase, in order to awaken the person more easily.\n\n====Orientation sensing====\n\nA number of 21st century devices use accelerometers to align the screen depending on the direction the device is held, for example switching between portrait and [[Page orientation|landscape mode]]s. Such devices include many [[tablet computer|tablet PC]]s and some [[smartphone]]s and [[digital camera]]s. The Amida [[Simputer]], a handheld Linux device launched in 2004, was the first commercial handheld to have a built-in accelerometer. It had incorporated many gesture based interactions using this accelerometer, including page-turning, zoom-in and zoom-out of images, change of portrait to landscape mode and many simple gesture-based games.\n\nAs of January 2009, almost all new mobile phones and digital cameras contain at least a [[tilt sensor]] and sometimes an accelerometer for the purpose of auto image rotation, motion-sensitive mini-games, and to correct shake when taking photographs.\n\n====Image stabilization====\n\nCamcorders use accelerometers for [[image stabilization]], either by moving optical elements to adjust the light path to the sensor to cancel out unintended motions or digitally shifting the image to smooth out detected motion. Some stills cameras use accelerometers for anti-blur capturing. The camera holds off capturing the image when the camera is moving. When the camera is still (if only for a millisecond, as could be the case for vibration), the image is captured. An example of the application of this technology is the Glogger VS2,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.eyetap.org|title=Glogger|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref> a phone application which runs on [[Symbian]] based phones with accelerometers such as the [[Nokia N96]]. Some digital cameras contain accelerometers to determine the orientation of the photo being taken and also for rotating the current picture when viewing.\n\n====Device integrity====\n{{Main|Active hard-drive protection}}\n\nMany laptops feature an accelerometer which is used to detect drops. If a drop is detected, the heads of the [[Hard disk drive|hard disk]] are parked to avoid data loss and possible head or disk damage by the ensuing [[Shock (mechanics)|shock]].\n\n===Gravimetry===\n{{Main|gravimeter}}\n\nA '''gravimeter''' or gravitometer, is an instrument used in [[gravimetry]] for measuring the local [[gravitational field]]. A gravimeter is a type of accelerometer, except that accelerometers are susceptible to all [[vibration]]s including [[noise]], that cause oscillatory accelerations. This is counteracted in the gravimeter by integral vibration isolation and [[signal processing]]. Though the essential principle of design is the same as in accelerometers, gravimeters are typically designed to be much more sensitive than accelerometers in order to measure very tiny changes within the [[Earth]]'s [[gravitation|gravity]], of 1 ''g''. In contrast, other accelerometers are often designed to measure 1000 ''g'' or more, and many perform multi-axial measurements. The constraints on [[temporal resolution]] are usually less for gravimeters, so that resolution can be increased by processing the output with a longer \"time constant\".\n\n==Types of accelerometer==\n{{colbegin|2}}\n* Bulk micromachined capacitive\n* Bulk micromachined piezoelectric resistive\n* Capacitive spring mass system  base\n* DC response\n* Electromechanical [[Servomechanism|servo]] (Servo Force Balance)\n* High gravity\n* High temperature\n* [[Laser accelerometer]]\n* [[Low frequency]]\n* [[Electromagnetic induction|Magnetic induction]]\n* Modally tuned impact hammers\n* Null-balance\n* [[Optics|Optical]]\n* [[PIGA accelerometer|Pendulous integrating gyroscopic accelerometer]] (PIGA)\n* [[Piezoelectric accelerometer]]\n* Quantum (Rubidium atom cloud, laser cooled)\n* [[Resonance]]\n* Seat pad accelerometers\n* Shear mode accelerometer\n* [[Strain gauge]]\n* [[Surface acoustic wave]] (SAW)\n* Surface micromachined capacitive ([[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]])\n* Thermal (submicrometre [[CMOS]] process)\n* Triaxial\n* [[List of vacuum tubes#DDR|Vacuum diode with flexible anode]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tubedata.milbert.com/sheets/154/d/DDR100.pdf |title= Mullard: ''DDR100 Accelerometer Double Diode'' data sheet |format=PDF |accessdate=7 May 2013}}</ref>\n* potentiometric type \n* LVDT type accelerometer\n{{colend}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Accelerometers}}\n* [[g-force]]\n* [[Geophone]]\n* [[Gyroscope]]\n* [[Inclinometer]]\n* [[Inertial navigation system|Inertial navigation]]\n* [[Accelerograph]]\n* [[Seismometer]]\n* [[Shock and vibration data logger|Shock, Vibration & Acceleration Data Logger]]\n* [[Degrees of freedom|Degrees of Freedom]]\n* [[Vibration Calibrator|Vibration calibrator]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Sensors}}\n\n[[Category:Accelerometers]]\n[[Category:Acceleration]]"}]}}}}
