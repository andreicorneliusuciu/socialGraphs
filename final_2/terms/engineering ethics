The field examines and sets the obligations by [[engineer]]s to [[society]], to their clients, and to the profession.  As a scholarly discipline, it is closely related to subjects such as the [[philosophy of science]], the [[philosophy of engineering]], and the [[ethics of technology]].\n\n==Background and origins==\n\n===The 19th century and growing concern===\n[[File:Original Tay Bridge before the 1879 collapse.jpg|thumb|The first [[Tay Bridge disaster|Tay Bridge collapsed]] in 1879. At least sixty were killed.]]\nAs engineering rose as a distinct profession during the 19th century, engineers saw themselves as either independent professional practitioners or technical employees of large enterprises. There was considerable tension between the two sides as large industrial employers fought to maintain control of their employees.<ref>Layton (1986). pp. 6-9</ref>\n\nIn the United States growing professionalism gave rise to the development of four founding engineering societies: The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) (1851), the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]] (AIEE) (1884),<ref name = \"AIEE to IEEE\">The AIEE merged with the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]] (IRE) (1912) in 1963 to form the IEEE.</ref> the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) (1880), and the [[American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers|American Institute of Mining Engineers]] (AIME) (1871).<ref name = \"AIME\">AIME is now the umbrella organization of four technical societies: the [http://www.smenet.org/ Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration] (SME) (1957), [[The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society (TMS)|The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society]] (TMS) (1957), the [[Society of Petroleum Engineers]] (SPE) (1957), and the [http://www.aist.org Association For Iron and Steel Technology] (AIST) (1974).

These had a profound effect on engineers and forced the profession to confront shortcomings in technical and construction practice, as well as ethical standards.<ref>ASME member H.F.J. Porter had proposed as early as 1892 that the engineering societies adopt uniform membership, education, and licensing requirements as well as a code of ethics. (Layton (1986). pp. 45-46)</ref>\n\nOne response was the development of formal codes of ethics by three of the four founding engineering societies. AIEE adopted theirs in 1912. ASCE and ASME did so in 1914.<ref name = \"Layton pp. 70 & 114\">Layton (1986). pp. 70 & 114.</ref> AIME did not adopt a code of ethics in its history.<ref name = \"Layton p. 35\"/>\n\nConcerns for professional practice and protecting the public highlighted by these bridge failures, as well as the [[Boston molasses disaster]] (1919), provided impetus for another movement that had been underway for some time: to require formal credentials (Professional licensure in the US.) as a requirement to [[Professional Engineer|practice]]. This involves meeting some combination of educational, experience, and testing requirements.<ref name = \"Layton pp. 124-125\">Layton (1986). pp. 124-125.</ref>\n\nIn 1950, the [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|Association of German Engineers]] developed an oath for all its members titled 'The Confession of the Engineers', directly hinting at the role of engineers in the atrocities committed during World War II.<ref>{{cite book |title=Technische Intelligenz und \"Kulturfaktor Technik\" |editor-last=Dietz |editor-first=Burkhard |date=1996 |pages=29 |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=FGfkMqguYd4C}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Technik und Verantwortung im Nationalsozialismus |date=2004 |last=Lorenz |first=Werner |last2=Meyer |first2=Torsen |pages=55 |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=9ClQ9yxA7-QC}}</ref><ref>https://www.vdi.de/fileadmin/media/content/hg/16.pdf</ref>\n\nOver the following decades most American states and Canadian provinces either required engineers to be licensed, or passed special legislation reserving title rights to organization of professional engineers.<ref name = \"Layton\">Layton (1986)</ref> The Canadian model is to require all persons working in fields of engineering that posed a risk to life, health, property, the public welfare and the environment to be licensed, and all provinces required licensing by the 1950s.\n\nThe US model has generally been only to require those practicing independently (i.e. consulting engineers) to be licensed, while engineers working in industry, education, and sometimes government need not be licensed. This has perpetuated the split between professional engineers and those in industry.<ref name = \"Layton pp. 6-7\">Layton (1986). pp. 6-7</ref> Professional societies have adopted generally uniform codes of ethics. On the other hand, technical societies have generally not adopted these, but instead sometimes offer ethics education and resources to members similar to those of the professional societies. This is not uniform, and the question of who is to be held in the highest regard: the public or the employer, is still an open one in industry, and sometimes in professional practice.<ref name = \"Layton\"/>\n\n===Recent developments===\n[[File:Citigroup center from ground.jpg|thumb|[[Citigroup Center#Engineering crisis of 1978|William LeMessurier's response]] to design deficiencies uncovered after construction of the Citigroup Center is often cited as an example of ethical conduct.]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ritual of the Calling of the Engineer Stamp 2000 Zoomed.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Canada Post stamp commemorating the 75th anniversary of [[The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer]].

In addition to the professional societies and chartering organizations efforts with their members, the Canadian [[Iron Ring]] and American [[Order of the Engineer]] trace their roots to the 1907 Quebec Bridge collapse. Both require members to swear an oath to uphold ethical practice and wear a symbolic ring as a reminder.\n\nIn the United States, the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] released in 1946 its Canons of Ethics for Engineers and Rules of Professional Conduct, which evolved to the current Code of Ethics, adopted in 1964. These requests ultimately led to the creation of the Board of Ethical Review in 1954. Ethics cases rarely have easy answers, but the BER's nearly 500 advisory opinions have helped bring clarity to the ethical issues engineers face daily.<ref name=BER>{{cite web\n | title =Board of Ethical Review \n | publisher =National Society of Professional Engineers\n | year =2013\n | url =http://www.nspe.org/Ethics/BoardofEthicalReview/index.html\n | accessdate =Nov 29, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nCurrently, bribery and political corruption is being addressed very directly by several professional societies and business groups around the world.<ref name = \"TI bribery\">{{cite book | author = Transparency International and Social Accountability International |year = 2009 | title = Business Principles for Countering Bribery | url =http://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/pub/business_principles_for_countering_bribery| accessdate = 2013-11-29 }}</ref><ref name = \"ASCE bribery\">{{cite press release | title = Report Details Guidelines to Reduce Corruption in Engineering and Construction Industry | publisher = ASCE | date = 2005-06-17 | url = http://www.asce.org/pressroom/news/display_press.cfm?uid=1794 | accessdate = 2006-10-20 }}</ref> However, new issues have arisen, such as [[offshoring]], [[sustainable development]], and environmental protection, that the profession is having to consider and address.\n\n==General principles==\n{{Rquote|right|Engineers, in the fulfillment of their professional duties, shall hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public|National Society of Professional Engineers|<ref name=\"NSPE Paramount\"/>}}\n\n{{Rquote|right|A practitioner shall, regard the practitioner's duty to public welfare as paramount.\"|Professional Engineers Ontario|<ref name=\"PEO public good\"/>}}\n\nCodes of engineering ethics identify a specific precedence with respect to the engineer's consideration for the [[society|public]], clients, employers, and the profession.\n\nMany engineering professional societies have prepared codes of ethics. Some date to the early decades of the twentieth century.<ref name = \"Layton\"/> These have been incorporated to a greater or lesser degree into the regulatory laws of several jurisdictions.  While these statements of general principles served as a guide, engineers still require sound judgment to interpret how the code would apply to specific circumstances.\n\nThe general principles of the codes of ethics are largely similar across the various engineering societies and chartering authorities of the world,<ref name=\"ICE canon\">ICE (2004).</ref> which further extend the code and publish specific guidance.<ref name=\"ASCE Standards\">ASCE (2000).</ref> The following is an example from the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]:<ref name=\"ASCE canons\">ASCE [1914] (2006).</ref>\n\n#Engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public and shall strive to comply with the principles of sustainable development in the performance of their professional duties.<ref name=\"ASCE canons\"/>\n#Engineers shall perform services only in areas of their competence.<ref name=\"ASCE canons\"/>\n#Engineers shall issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner.<ref name=\"ASCE canons\"/>\n#Engineers shall act in professional matters for each employer or client as faithful agents or trustees, and shall avoid conflicts of interest.<ref name=\"ASCE canons\"/>\n#Engineers shall build their professional reputation on the merit of their services and shall not compete unfairly with others.\n#Engineers shall act in such a manner as to uphold and enhance the honor, integrity, and dignity of the engineering profession and shall act with zero-tolerance for bribery, fraud, and corruption.<ref name=\"ASCE canons\"/>\n#Engineers shall continue their professional development throughout their careers, and shall provide opportunities for the professional development of those engineers under their supervision.<ref name=\"ASCE canons\"/>\n\n===Obligation to society===\nThe paramount value recognized by engineers is the safety and welfare of the public.
