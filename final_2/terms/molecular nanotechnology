Based on [[Richard Feynman]]'s vision of miniature factories using nanomachines to build complex products ([[self-replicating machine|including additional nanomachines]]), this advanced form of [[nanotechnology]] (or ''molecular manufacturing''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wise-nano.org/w/Doing_MM |title=Doing MM |publisher=Wise Nano |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref>) would make use of positionally-controlled mechanosynthesis guided by [[molecular machine]] systems. MNT would involve combining physical principles demonstrated by [[biophysics]], [[chemistry]], other nanotechnologies, and the [[Molecular machine#Biological|molecular machinery of life]] with the systems engineering principles found in modern macroscale factories.\n\n==Introduction==\n\nWhile conventional chemistry uses inexact processes obtaining inexact results, and biology exploits inexact processes to obtain definitive results, molecular nanotechnology would employ original definitive processes to obtain definitive results. The desire in molecular nanotechnology would be to balance molecular reactions in positionally-controlled locations and orientations to obtain desired chemical reactions, and then to build systems by further assembling the products of these reactions.\n\nA roadmap for the development of MNT is an objective of a broadly based technology project led by [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle]] (the manager of several U.S. National Laboratories) and the [[Foresight Institute]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/cms/press_center/282 |title=Foresight Institute press release |publisher=Foresight.org |date=2008-01-29 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> The roadmap was originally scheduled for completion by late 2006, but was released in January 2008.<ref>{{cite web|last=Peterson |first=Christine |url=http://www.foresight.org/nanodot/?p=2478#more-2478 |title=Nanodot: Nanotechnology News and Discussion \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb Nanotechnology Roadmap launch: Productive Nanosystems Conference, Oct 9-10 |publisher=Foresight.org |date=2007-05-08 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> The Nanofactory Collaboration<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory |title=Nanofactory Collaboration |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> is a more focused ongoing effort involving 23 researchers from 10 organizations and 4 countries that is developing a practical research agenda<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/Challenges.htm |title=Nanofactory Technical Challenges |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> specifically aimed at positionally-controlled diamond mechanosynthesis and diamondoid nanofactory development. In August 2005, a task force consisting of 50+ international experts from various fields was organized by the [http://www.crnano.org/ Center for Responsible Nanotechnology] to study the societal implications of molecular nanotechnology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crnano.org|title=Global Task Force on Implications and Policy |publisher=Crnano.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref>\n\n==Projected applications and capabilities==\n\n===Smart materials and nanosensors===\nOne proposed application of MNT is so-called [[smart material]]s.  This term refers to any sort of material designed and engineered at the [[nanometer]] scale for a specific task. It encompasses a wide variety of possible commercial applications.  One example would be materials designed to respond differently to various molecules; such a capability could lead, for example, to artificial drugs which would recognize and render inert specific [[viruses]].  Another is the idea of [[Self-healing material|self-healing structures]], which would [[Regeneration (biology)|repair]] small tears in a surface naturally in the same way as self-sealing tires or human skin.\n\nA MNT nanosensor would resemble a smart material, involving a small component within a larger machine that would react to its environment and change in some fundamental, intentional way.  A very simple example: a photosensor might passively measure the incident light and discharge its absorbed energy as electricity when the light passes above or below a specified threshold, sending a signal to a larger machine.  Such a sensor would supposedly cost less and use less power than a conventional sensor, and yet function usefully in all the same applications &mdash; for example, turning on parking lot lights when it gets dark.\n\nWhile smart materials and nanosensors both exemplify useful applications of MNT, they pale in comparison with the complexity of the technology most popularly associated with the term: the replicating [[nanorobot]].\n\n===Replicating nanorobots===\n\nMNT nanofacturing is popularly linked with the idea of [[swarm intelligence|swarm]]s of coordinated nanoscale robots working together, a popularization of an early proposal by [[K. Eric Drexler]] in his [[Engines of Creation|1986 discussions of MNT]], but [http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/Nanosystems/toc.html superseded in 1992]. In this early proposal, sufficiently capable nanorobots would construct more nanorobots in an artificial environment containing special molecular building blocks.\n\nCritics have doubted both the feasibility of self-replicating [[nanorobot]]s and the feasibility of control if self-replicating nanorobots could be achieved: they cite the possibility of [[mutation]]s removing any control and favoring reproduction of mutant pathogenic variations.  Advocates address the first doubt by pointing out that the first macroscale autonomous machine replicator, made of [[Lego blocks]], was built and operated experimentally in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.23.4.htm |title=3.23.4 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref>  While there are sensory advantages present at the macroscale compared to the limited sensorium available at the nanoscale, proposals for positionally controlled nanoscale mechanosynthetic fabrication systems employ dead reckoning of tooltips combined with reliable reaction sequence design to ensure reliable results, hence a limited sensorium is no handicap;  similar considerations apply to the positional assembly of small nanoparts.  Advocates address the second doubt by arguing that [[bacterium|bacteria]] are (of necessity) evolved to evolve, while nanorobot mutation could be actively prevented by common [[Error-correction|error-correcting]] techniques. Similar ideas are advocated in the Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/index.html |title=Molecular Nanotechnology Guidelines |publisher=Foresight.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> and a map of the 137-dimensional replicator design space<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.1.9.htm |title=5.1.9 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> recently published by Freitas and Merkle provides numerous proposed methods by which replicators could, in principle, be safely controlled by good design.\n\nHowever, the concept of suppressing mutation raises the question: How can design evolution occur at the nanoscale without a process of random mutation and deterministic selection? Critics argue that MNT advocates have not provided a substitute for such a process of evolution in this nanoscale arena where conventional sensory-based selection processes are lacking.  The limits of the sensorium available at the nanoscale could make it difficult or impossible to winnow successes from failures.  Advocates argue that design evolution should occur deterministically and strictly under human control, using the conventional engineering paradigm of modeling, design, prototyping, testing, analysis, and redesign.\n\nIn any event, since 1992 [http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/Nanosystems/toc.html technical proposals for MNT] do not include self-replicating nanorobots, and recent ethical guidelines put forth by MNT advocates prohibit unconstrained self-replication.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/MMDangerous.pdf |title=N04FR06-p.15.pmd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref>\n\n===Medical nanorobots===\n\nOne of the most important applications of MNT would be medical [[nanorobotics]] or [[nanomedicine]], an area pioneered by [[Robert Freitas]] in numerous books<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nanomedicine.com |title=NanomedicineBookSite |publisher=Nanomedicine.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> and papers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/NanoPubls.htm |title=NanoPubls |publisher=Rfreitas.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref>  The ability to design, build, and deploy large numbers of medical nanorobots would, at a minimum, make possible the rapid elimination of disease and the reliable and relatively painless recovery from physical trauma.  Medical nanorobots might also make possible the convenient correction of genetic defects, and help to ensure a greatly expanded lifespan.  More controversially, medical nanorobots might be used to [[Human enhancement|augment natural human capabilities]].\n\n===Utility fog===\n\n[[Image:Foglet.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a 100 micrometer foglet]]\nAnother proposed application of molecular nanotechnology is \"[[utility fog]]\"<ref>http://discuss.foresight.org/~josh/Ufog.html</ref> &mdash; in which a cloud of networked microscopic robots (simpler than [[Molecular assembler|assembler]]s) would change its shape and properties to form macroscopic objects and tools in accordance with software commands.  Rather than modify the current practices of consuming material goods in different forms, utility fog would simply replace many physical objects.\n\n===Phased-array optics===\n\nYet another proposed application of MNT would be [[phased-array optics]] (PAO).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phased-array.com |title=Phased Array Optics |publisher=Phased-array.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref>  However, this appears to be a problem addressable by ordinary nanoscale technology. PAO would use the principle of phased-array millimeter technology but at optical wavelengths.  This would permit the duplication of any sort of optical effect but virtually.  Users could request holograms, sunrises and sunsets, or floating lasers as the mood strikes.  PAO systems were described in BC Crandall's ''Nanotechnology:  Molecular Speculations on Global Abundance'' in the [[Brian Wowk]] article \"Phased-Array Optics.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phased-array.com/1996-Book-Chapter.html |title=Phased Array Optics |publisher=Phased-array.com |date=1991-10-03 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref>\n\n==Potential social impacts==\n\n[[Molecular manufacturing]] is a potential future subfield of nanotechnology that would make it possible to  build complex structures at atomic precision.<ref name=\"Foresight nano FAQ\">{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Molecular Manufacturing|url=http://www.foresight.org/nano/whatismm.html|website=foresight.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref> Molecular manufacturing requires significant advances in nanotechnology, but once achieved could produce highly advanced products at low costs and in large quantities in nanofactories weighing a kilogram or more.<ref name=\"Foresight nano FAQ\"/><ref name= \"GCRs nano-chapter\"/> When nanofactories gain the ability to produce other nanofactories production may only be limited by relatively abundant factors such as input materials, energy and software.<ref name= \"GCRs nano-chapter\"/>\n\nThe products of molecular manufacturing could range from cheaper, mass-produced versions of known high-tech products to novel products with added capabilities in many areas of application.

Eric Drexler|Eric Drexler]] in his 1986 book ''[[Engines of Creation]]'',<ref>{{cite book |title= Apocalypse 2012 |last= Joseph |first= Lawrence E. |year= 2007 |publisher= Broadway |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-7679-2448-1 |page= 6 |url= }}</ref> has been analyzed by Freitas in \"Some Limits to Global Ecophagy by Biovorous Nanoreplicators, with Public Policy Recommendations\" [http://www.foresight.org/nano/Ecophagy.html] and has been a theme in mainstream media and fiction.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3788673.stm| title=Nanotech guru turns back on 'goo'| publisher= BBC News|accessdate=2012-03-30|first=Paul|last=Rincon|date=2004-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Hapgood |first=Fred |date=November 1986 |title=Nanotechnology: Molecular Machines that Mimic Life |url=http://metamodern.com/b/wp-content/uploads/docs/OMNI_TINYTECH.pdf |journal=Omni |accessdate=19 July 2014 }}</ref> This scenario involves tiny self-replicating robots that consume the entire biosphere using it as a source of energy and building blocks.  Nanotech experts including Drexler now discredit the scenario. According to  [[Chris Phoenix (nanotechnologist)|Chris Phoenix]] a \"So-called grey goo could only be the product of a deliberate and difficult engineering process, not an accident\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Leading nanotech experts put 'grey goo' in perspective|url=http://www.crnano.org/PR-IOP.htm|website=crnano.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref> With the advent of nano-biotech, a different scenario called [[green goo]] has been forwarded. Here, the malignant substance is not nanobots but rather self-replicating biological [[organism]]s engineered through nanotechnology.\n\n===Benefits===\n\n<blockquote>\nNanotechnology (or molecular nanotechnology to refer more specifically to the goals discussed here) will let us continue the historical trends in manufacturing right up to the fundamental limits imposed by physical law. It will let us make remarkably powerful molecular computers. It will let us make materials over fifty times lighter than steel or aluminium alloy but with the same strength. We'll be able to make jets, rockets, cars or even chairs that, by today's standards, would be remarkably light, strong, and inexpensive. Molecular surgical tools, guided by molecular computers and injected into the blood stream could find and destroy cancer cells or invading bacteria, unclog arteries, or provide oxygen when the circulation is impaired.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nNanotechnology will replace our entire manufacturing base with a new, radically more precise, radically less expensive, and radically more flexible way of making products. The aim is not simply to replace today's computer chip making plants, but also to replace the assembly lines for cars, televisions, telephones, books, surgical tools, missiles, bookcases, airplanes, tractors, and all the rest. The objective is a pervasive change in manufacturing, a change that will leave virtually no product untouched. Economic progress and military readiness in the 21st Century will depend fundamentally on maintaining a competitive position in nanotechnology.\n\n<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.merkle.com/papers/nanohearing1999.html \n  | title = Nanotechnology: the coming revolution in manufacturing, Testimony to the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, Subcommittee on Basic Research\n  | first = Ralph\n  | last = Merkle\n  | date = 22 June 1999\n   }}</ref>\n\n</blockquote>\n\nDespite the current early developmental status of nanotechnology and molecular nanotechnology,  much concern surrounds MNT's anticipated impact on [[economics]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/NoninflationaryPN.pdf |title=N20FR06-p._.pmd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref><ref>http://lifeboat.com/ex/corporate.cornucopia</ref> and on [[law]]. Whatever the exact effects, MNT, if achieved, would tend to reduce the [[scarcity]] of manufactured goods and make many more goods (such as food and health aids) manufacturable.\n\nIt is generally considered {{by whom|date=June 2015}} that future citizens of a molecular-nanotechnological society would still need money, in the form of unforgeable [[digital cash]] or physical specie<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/TangibleNanomoney.htm |title=Tangible Nanomoney |publisher=Rfreitas.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> (in special circumstances). They might use such money to buy goods and services that are unique, or limited within the [[solar system]].  These might include: [[matter]], [[energy]], [[information]], real estate, design services, entertainment services, legal services, [[Celebrity|fame]], [[political power]], or the attention of other people to one's political/religious/philosophical message. Furthermore, futurists must consider war, even between prosperous states, and non-economic goals.\n\nIf MNT were realized, some resources would remain limited, because unique physical objects are limited (a plot of land in the real [[Jerusalem]], mining rights to the larger near-earth asteroids) or because they depend on the goodwill of a particular person (the love of a famous person, a live audience in a musical concert). Demand will always exceed supply for some things, and a [[political economy]] may continue to exist in any case. Whether the interest in these limited resources would diminish with the advent of [[virtual reality]], where they could be easily substituted, is yet unclear. One reason why it might not is a hypothetical preference for \"the real thing\", although such an opinion could easily be mollified if virtual reality were to develop to a certain level of quality.\n\nMNT should make possible [[Nanomedicine|nanomedical]] capabilities able to cure any medical condition not already cured by advances in other areas. Good health would be common, and poor health of any form would be as rare as [[smallpox]] and [[scurvy]] are today. Even [[cryonics]] would be feasible, as [[cryopreserved]] tissue could be fully repaired.\n\n===Risks===\nMolecular nanotechnology is one of the technologies that some analysts believe could lead to a [[Technological Singularity]].\nSome feel that molecular nanotechnology would have daunting risks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crnano.org/dangers.htm |title=Nanotechnology: Dangers of Molecular Manufacturing |publisher=Crnano.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> It conceivably could enable cheaper and more destructive conventional [[weapon]]s.  Also, molecular nanotechnology might permit [[weapons of mass destruction]] that could self-replicate, as [[virus (biology)|virus]]es and [[cancer]] cells do when attacking the human body. Commentators generally agree that, in the event molecular nanotechnology were developed, its [[self-replication]] should be permitted only under very controlled or \"inherently safe\" conditions.\n\nA fear exists that nanomechanical robots, if achieved, and if designed to self-replicate using naturally occurring materials (a difficult task), could consume the entire planet in their hunger for raw materials,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/Ecophagy.htm |title=Some Limits to Global Ecophagy |publisher=Rfreitas.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> or simply crowd out natural life, out-competing it for energy (as happened historically when [[blue-green algae]] appeared and outcompeted earlier life forms).  Some commentators have referred to this situation as the \"[[grey goo]]\" or \"[[ecophagy]]\" scenario.  [[K. Eric Drexler]] considers an accidental \"grey goo\" scenario extremely unlikely and says so in later editions of ''Engines of Creation''.\n\nIn light of this perception of potential danger, the [[Foresight Institute]] (founded by [[K. Eric Drexler]] to prepare for the arrival of future technologies) has drafted a set of guidelines<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/current.html |title=Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology |publisher=Foresight.org |date=2006-04-06 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> for the ethical development of nanotechnology.  These include the banning of free-foraging self-replicating pseudo-organisms on the Earth's surface, at least, and possibly in other places.\n\n==Technical issues and criticism==\nThe feasibility of the basic technologies analyzed in ''Nanosystems'' has been the subject of a formal scientific review by U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and has also been the focus of extensive debate on the internet and in the popular press.\n\n===Study and recommendations by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences===\n\nIn 2006, U.S. National Academy of Sciences released the report of a study of molecular manufacturing as part of a longer report, ''A Matter of Size: Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative''<ref name=\"nanotechnology1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11752.html |title=A Matter of Size: Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative |publisher=Nap.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> The study committee reviewed the technical content of ''Nanosystems'', and in its conclusion states that no current theoretical analysis can be considered definitive regarding several questions of potential system performance, and that optimal paths for implementing high-performance systems cannot be predicted with confidence. It recommends experimental research to advance knowledge in this area:\n\n:\"Although theoretical calculations can be made today, the eventually attainable range of chemical reaction cycles, error rates, speed of operation, and thermodynamic efficiencies of such bottom-up manufacturing systems cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Thus, the eventually attainable perfection and complexity of manufactured products, while they can be calculated in theory, cannot be predicted with confidence. Finally, the optimum research paths that might lead to systems which greatly exceed the thermodynamic efficiencies and other capabilities of biological systems cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Research funding that is based on the ability of investigators to produce experimental demonstrations that link to abstract models and guide long-term vision is most appropriate to achieve this goal.\"\n\n===Assemblers versus nanofactories===\nA section heading in Drexler's ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' reads<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Cover.html |title=Engines of Creation - K. Eric Drexler : Cover |publisher=E-drexler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> \"Universal Assemblers\", and the following text speaks of multiple types of [[Assembler (nanotechnology)|assemblers]] which, collectively, could hypothetically \"build almost anything that the laws of nature allow to exist.\" Drexler's colleague [[Ralph Merkle]] has noted that, contrary to widespread legend,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/impact/impossible.html#Fear |title=How good scientists reach bad conclusions |publisher=Foresight.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> Drexler never claimed that assembler systems could build absolutely any molecular structure. The endnotes in Drexler's book explain the qualification \"almost\": \"For example, a delicate structure might be designed that, like a stone arch, would self-destruct unless all its pieces were already in place. If there were no room in the design for the placement and removal of a scaffolding, then the structure might be impossible to build. Few structures of practical interest seem likely to exhibit such a problem, however.\"\n\nIn 1992, Drexler published ''Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/Nanosystems/toc.html |title=Nanosystems TOC |publisher=E-drexler.com |date=2002-11-01 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> a detailed proposal for synthesizing stiff covalent structures using a table-top factory. [[Diamondoid]] structures and other stiff covalent structures, if achieved, would have a wide range of possible applications, going far beyond current [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] technology. An outline of a path was put forward in 1992 for building a table-top factory in the absence of an assembler. Other researchers have begun advancing tentative, alternative proposed paths <ref name=\"autogenerated3\" /> for this in the years since Nanosystems was published.\n\n===Hard versus soft nanotechnology===\nIn 2004 [http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/ Richard Jones] wrote Soft Machines (nanotechnology and life), a book for lay audiences published by [[Oxford University]]. In this book he describes radical nanotechnology (as advocated by Drexler) as a deterministic/mechanistic idea of nano engineered  machines that does not take into account the nanoscale challenges such as [[wetness]], stickness, [[Brownian motion]], and high [[viscosity]]. He also explains what is soft nanotechnology or more appropriatelly [[biomimetic]] nanotechnology which is the way forward, if not the best way, to design functional nanodevices that can cope with all the problems at a nanoscale. One can think of soft nanotechnology as the development of nanomachines that uses the lessons learned from biology on how things work, chemistry to precisely engineer such devices and stochastic physics to model the system and its natural processes in detail.\n\n===The Smalley-Drexler debate===\n{{main|Drexler\u2013Smalley debate on molecular nanotechnology}}\n\nSeveral researchers, including Nobel Prize winner [[Richard Smalley|Dr. Richard Smalley]] (1943\u20132005),<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&ARTICLEID_CHAR=F90C4210-C153-4B2F-83A1-28F2012B637|date=September 2001| journal=Scientific American| title=Of Chemistry, Love and Nanobots| first= Richard E.| last= Smalley}}</ref> attacked the notion of universal assemblers, leading to a rebuttal from Drexler and colleagues,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imm.org/SciAmDebate2/smalley.php |title=Debate About Assemblers \u2014 Smalley Rebuttal |publisher=Imm.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> and eventually to an exchange of letters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html |title=C&En: Cover Story - Nanotechnology |publisher=Pubs.acs.org |date=2003-12-01 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> Smalley argued that chemistry is extremely complicated, reactions are hard to control, and that a universal assembler is science fiction. Drexler and colleagues, however, noted that Drexler never proposed universal assemblers able to make absolutely anything, but instead proposed more limited assemblers able to make a very wide variety of things. They challenged the relevance of Smalley's arguments to the more specific proposals advanced in ''Nanosystems''.  Also, Smalley argued that nearly all of modern chemistry involves reactions that take place in a [[solvent]] (usually [[water]]), because the [[small molecules]] of a solvent contribute many things, such as lowering [[binding energies]] for transition states.  Since nearly all known chemistry requires a solvent, Smalley felt that Drexler's proposal to use a high vacuum environment was not feasible.  However, Drexler addresses this in Nanosystems by showing mathematically that well designed [[catalysts]] can provide the effects of a solvent and can fundamentally be made even more efficient than a solvent/[[enzyme]] reaction could ever be. It is noteworthy that, contrary to Smalley's opinion that enzymes require water, \"Not only do enzymes work vigorously in anhydrous organic media, but in this unnatural milieu they acquire remarkable properties such as greatly enhanced stability, radically altered substrate and [[enantiomeric]] specificities, molecular memory, and the ability to catalyse unusual reactions.\"{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2658221|title=Enzymatic catalysis in anhydrous organic solvents.|date=April 1989}}\"{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC397741/pdf/pnas00350-0138.pdf|title=Enzymatic catalysis in anhydrous organic solvents|date=April 1989}}\n\n===Design issues===\nFor the future, some means have to be found for MNT design evolution at the nanoscale which mimics the process of biological evolution at the molecular scale. Biological evolution proceeds by random variation in ensemble averages of organisms combined with culling of the less-successful variants and reproduction of the more-successful variants, and macroscale engineering design also proceeds by a process of design evolution from simplicity to complexity as set forth somewhat satirically by [[John Gall (author)|John Gall]]: \"A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.  . . . A complex system designed from scratch never works and can not be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a system that works.\" <ref name=\"JohGall\">\nGall, John, (1986) Systemantics: How Systems Really Work and How They Fail, 2nd ed. Ann Arbor, MI : The General Systemantics Press.</ref> A breakthrough in MNT is needed which proceeds from the simple atomic ensembles which can be built with, e.g., an STM to complex MNT systems via a process of design evolution. A handicap in this process is the difficulty of seeing and manipulation at the nanoscale compared to the macroscale which makes deterministic selection of successful trials difficult; in contrast biological evolution proceeds via action of what Richard Dawkins has called the \"blind watchmaker\"\n<ref name = \"Dawkins\">\nRichard Dawkins, The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design, W. W. Norton; Reissue edition (September 19, 1996)\n</ref> \ncomprising random molecular variation and deterministic reproduction/extinction.\n\nAt present in 2007 the practice of nanotechnology embraces both stochastic approaches (in which, for example, [[supramolecular chemistry]] creates waterproof pants) and deterministic approaches wherein single molecules (created by stochastic chemistry) are manipulated on substrate surfaces (created by stochastic deposition methods) by deterministic methods comprising nudging them with [[scanning tunneling microscope|STM]] or [[Atomic force microscope|AFM]] probes and causing simple binding or cleavage reactions to occur. The dream of a complex, deterministic molecular nanotechnology remains elusive.  Since the mid-1990s, thousands of surface scientists and thin film technocrats have latched on to the nanotechnology bandwagon and redefined their disciplines as nanotechnology.  This has caused much confusion in the field and has spawned thousands of \"nano\"-papers on the peer reviewed literature.  Most of these reports are extensions of the more ordinary research done in the parent fields.\n\n===The feasibility of the proposals in ''Nanosystems''===\n{{Multiple image\n|direction = vertical\n|image1 = Molecularpropeller.jpg\n|image2 = Nanob.jpg\n|footer = Top, a molecular propellor. Bottom, a molecular [[planetary gear]] system. The feasibility of devices like these has been questioned.}}\n\nThe feasibility of Drexler's proposals largely depends, therefore, on whether designs like those in ''Nanosystems'' could be built in the absence of a universal assembler to build them and would work as described. Supporters of molecular nanotechnology frequently claim that no significant errors have been discovered in ''Nanosystems'' since 1992. Even some critics concede<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/index.php?p=50#comment-523 |title=Blog Archive \u00bb Is mechanosynthesis feasible?

Recent such further work by Freitas and Merkle <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/Publications.htm |title=Nanofactory Collaboration Publications |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> is aimed at strengthening these foundations by filling the existing gaps in the low-level chemistry.\n\nDrexler argues that we may need to wait until our conventional [[nanotechnology]] improves before solving these issues: \"Molecular manufacturing will result from a series of advances in molecular machine systems, much as the first Moon landing resulted from a series of advances in liquid-fuel [[rocket]] systems. We are now in a position like that of the [[British Interplanetary Society]] of the 1930s which described how multistage liquid-fueled rockets could reach the Moon and pointed to early rockets as illustrations of the basic principle.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.softmachines.org/PDFs/Moriarty_Phoenix_1.pdf |title=Moriarity Correspondence |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref>  However, Freitas and Merkle argue <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/index.htm#NeedFund |title=Nanofactory Collaboration |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> that a focused effort to achieve diamond mechanosynthesis (DMS) can begin now, using existing technology, and might achieve success in less than a decade if their \"direct-to-DMS approach is pursued rather than a more circuitous development approach that seeks to implement less efficacious nondiamondoid molecular manufacturing technologies before progressing to diamondoid\".\n\nTo summarize the arguments against feasibility:  First, critics argue that a primary barrier to achieving molecular nanotechnology is the lack of an efficient way to create machines on a molecular/atomic scale, especially in the absence of a well-defined path toward a self-replicating assembler or diamondoid nanofactory. Advocates respond that a preliminary research path leading to a diamondoid nanofactory is being developed.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nA second difficulty in reaching molecular nanotechnology is design.  Hand design of a gear or bearing at the level of atoms might take a few to several weeks. While Drexler, Merkle and others have created designs of simple parts, no comprehensive design effort for anything approaching the complexity of a Model T Ford has been attempted.  Advocates respond that it is difficult to undertake a comprehensive design effort in the absence of significant funding for such efforts, and that despite this handicap much useful design-ahead has nevertheless been accomplished with new software tools that have been developed, e.g., at Nanorex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nanoengineer-1.com/content/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=40&Itemid=50 |title=Nanorex, Inc. - Molecular Machinery Gallery |publisher=Nanoengineer-1.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref>\n\nIn the latest report ''A Matter of Size: Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative''<ref name=\"nanotechnology1\"/> put out by the National Academies Press in December 2006 (roughly twenty years after Engines of Creation was published), no clear way forward toward molecular nanotechnology could yet be seen, as per the conclusion on page 108 of that report: \"Although theoretical calculations can be made today, the eventually attainable\nrange of chemical reaction cycles, error rates, speed of operation, and thermodynamic\nefficiencies of such bottom-up manufacturing systems cannot be reliably\npredicted at this time. Thus, the eventually attainable perfection and complexity of\nmanufactured products, while they can be calculated in theory, cannot be predicted\nwith confidence. Finally, the optimum research paths that might lead to systems\nwhich greatly exceed the thermodynamic efficiencies and other capabilities of\nbiological systems cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Research funding that\nis based on the ability of investigators to produce experimental demonstrations\nthat link to abstract models and guide long-term vision is most appropriate to\nachieve this goal.\" This call for research leading to demonstrations is welcomed by groups such as the Nanofactory Collaboration who are specifically seeking experimental successes in diamond mechanosynthesis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/DMS.htm |title=Diamond Mechanosynthesis |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref>  The \"Technology Roadmap for [[Productive nanosystems|Productive Nanosystems]]\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/roadmaps |title=Technology Roadmap for Productive Nanosystems |publisher=Foresight.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> aims to offer additional constructive insights.\n\nIt is perhaps interesting to ask whether or not most structures consistent with physical law can in fact be manufactured.  Advocates assert that to achieve most of the vision of molecular manufacturing it is not necessary to be able to build \"any structure that is compatible with natural law.\" Rather, it is necessary to be able to build only a sufficient (possibly modest) subset of such structures\u2014as is true, in fact, of any practical manufacturing process used in the world today, and is true even in biology.

For instance, Peng et al. (2006)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Papers/JCTNPengFeb06.pdf |title=03CTN01-003 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref> (in the continuing research effort by Freitas, Merkle and their collaborators) reports that the most-studied mechanosynthesis tooltip motif (DCB6Ge) successfully places a C<sub>2</sub> carbon [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] on a C(110) [[diamond]] surface at both 300&nbsp;K (room temperature) and 80&nbsp;K ([[liquid nitrogen]] temperature), and that the silicon variant (DCB6Si) also works at 80&nbsp;K but not at 300&nbsp;K. Over 100,000 CPU hours were invested in this latest study.  The DCB6 tooltip motif, initially described by Merkle and Freitas at a Foresight Conference in 2002, was the first complete tooltip ever proposed for diamond mechanosynthesis and remains the only tooltip motif that has been successfully simulated for its intended function on a full 200-atom diamond surface.\n\nThe tooltips modeled in this work are intended to be used only in carefully controlled environments (e.&nbsp;g., vacuum). Maximum acceptable limits for tooltip translational and rotational misplacement errors are reported in Peng et al. (2006) -- tooltips must be positioned with great accuracy to avoid bonding the dimer incorrectly.  Peng et al. (2006) reports that increasing the handle thickness from 4 support planes of C atoms above the tooltip to 5 planes decreases the resonance frequency of the entire structure from 2.0&nbsp;THz to 1.8&nbsp;THz.  More importantly, the vibrational footprints of a DCB6Ge tooltip mounted on a 384-atom handle and of the same tooltip mounted on a similarly constrained but much larger 636-atom \"crossbar\" handle are virtually identical in the non-crossbar directions. Additional computational studies modeling still bigger handle structures are welcome, but the ability to precisely position SPM tips to the requisite atomic accuracy has been repeatedly demonstrated experimentally at low temperature,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.uci.edu/~wilsonho/stm-iets.html |title=Wilson Ho |publisher=Physics.uci.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=90|issue=|page=176102|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.176102|bibcode=2003PhRvL..90q6102O}}</ref> or even at room temperature<ref>{{cite journal|author=R.

Also all sorts of devices from dust size detection devices to giant diamond zeppelins are constructed atom by atom using only carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and chlorine atoms.\n*In the novel ''Tomorrow'' by Andrew Saltzman (ISBN 1-4243-1027-X), a scientist uses [[nanorobotics]] to create a liquid that when inserted into the [[bloodstream]], renders one nearly [[Wiktionary|invincible]] given that the microscopic machines repair tissue almost instantaneously after it is damaged.\n*In the [[roleplaying game]] [[Splicers]] by [[Palladium Books]], humanity has succumbed to a \"nanobot plague\" that causes any object made of a non-[[precious metal]] to twist and change shape (sometimes into a type of [[robot]]) moments after being touched by a human.  The object will then proceed to attack the human.  This has forced humanity to develop \"biotechnological\" devices to replace those previously made of metal.\n* On the television show [[Mystery Science Theater 3000]], the [[Nanites]] (voiced variously by [[Kevin Murphy (actor)|Kevin Murphy]], [[Paul Chaplin (actor)|Paul Chaplin]], [[Mary Jo Pehl]], and [[Bridget Jones (actor)|Bridget Jones]]) - are self-replicating, bio-engineered organisms that work on the ship, they are microscopic creatures that reside in the Satellite of Love's computer systems.
