Electricity gives a wide variety of well-known effects, such as [[lightning]], [[static electricity]], [[electromagnetic induction]] and [[electric current]]. In addition, electricity permits the creation and reception of [[electromagnetic radiation]] such as [[radio wave]]s.\n\nIn electricity, charges produce [[electromagnetic field]]s which act on other charges. Electricity occurs due to several types of physics:\n* '''[[electric charge]]''': a property of some [[subatomic particle]]s, which determines their [[electromagnetic interaction]]s. Electrically charged matter is influenced by, and produces, electromagnetic fields, electric charges can be positive or negative.\n* '''[[electric field]]''' (see [[electrostatics]]): charges are surrounded by an electric field. The electric field produces a force on other charges. Changes in the electric field travel at the [[speed of light]].\n* '''[[electric potential]]''': the capacity of an electric field to do [[Work (mechanics)|work]] on an [[electric charge]], typically measured in [[volt]]s.\n* '''[[electric current]]''': a movement or flow of electrically charged particles, typically measured in [[ampere]]s.\n* '''[[electromagnets]]''': moving charges produce a [[magnetic field]]. Electric currents generate magnetic fields, and changing magnetic fields generate electric currents.\n\nIn [[electrical engineering]], electricity is used for:\n* '''[[electric power]]''' where electric current is used to energise equipment;\n* '''[[electronics]]''' which deals with [[electrical circuit]]s that involve [[active component|active electrical component]]s such as [[vacuum tube]]s, [[transistor]]s, [[diode]]s and [[integrated circuit]]s, and associated passive interconnection technologies.\n\nElectrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that [[Electrical engineering|engineers]] were able to put it to industrial and residential use. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include [[motive power|transport]], [[HVAC|heating]], [[electric lighting|lighting]], [[Telecommunication|communications]], and [[computation]].

Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] such as metal, and [[electrolysis]], where [[ion]]s (charged [[atom]]s) flow through liquids, or through [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]s such as electrical sparks.

These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] and required by most [[Electronics|electronic]] devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative.<ref name=bird>\n{{citation\n| first = John | last = Bird\n| title = Electrical and Electronic Principles and Technology, 3rd edition\n| publisher = Newnes\n| year = 2007\n| isbn = 9781417505432}}\n</ref>{{rp|11}} If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this takes the form of a [[sine wave]].<ref name=bird/>{{rp|206\u2013207}} Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under [[steady state]] direct current, such as [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]].<ref name=bird/>{{rp|223\u2013225}} These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to [[transient response|transients]], such as when first energised.\n\n===Electric field===\n{{Main|Electric field}}\n{{See also|Electrostatics}}\n\nThe concept of the electric [[Field (physics)|field]] was introduced by [[Michael Faraday]]. An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges in a similar manner to the way that the gravitational field acts between two [[mass]]es, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance.<ref name=Umashankar/> However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electric field can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker.<ref name=hawking/>\n\n[[Image:VFPt image charge plane horizontal.svg|thumb|Field lines emanating from a positive charge above a plane conductor]]\n\nAn electric field generally varies in space,<ref>Almost all electric fields vary in space. An exception is the electric field surrounding a planar conductor of infinite extent, the field of which is uniform.</ref> and its strength at any one point is defined as the force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point.<ref name=uniphysics/>{{rp|469\u2013470}} The conceptual charge, termed a '[[test charge]]', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own electric field disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of [[magnetic field]]s. As the electric field is defined in terms of [[force]], and force is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]], so it follows that an electric field is also a vector, having both [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and [[Direction (geometry)|direction]].

The field may be visualised by a set of imaginary lines whose direction at any point is the same as that of the field.

The field lines are the paths that a point positive charge would seek to make as it was forced to move within the field; they are however an imaginary concept with no physical existence, and the field permeates all the intervening space between the lines.<ref name=\"elec_princ_p73\"/> Field lines emanating from stationary charges have several key properties: first, that they originate at positive charges and terminate at negative charges; second, that they must enter any good conductor at right angles, and third, that they may never cross nor close in on themselves.<ref name=uniphysics/>{{rp|479}}\n\nA hollow conducting body carries all its charge on its outer surface.

There is a finite limit to the electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, [[electrical breakdown]] occurs and an [[electric arc]] causes flashover between the charged parts.

A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires [[Mechanical work|work]]. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an [[infinity|infinite distance]] slowly to that point. It is usually measured in [[volt]]s, and one volt is the potential for which one [[joule]] of work must be expended to bring a charge of one [[coulomb]] from infinity.<ref name=uniphysics/>{{rp|494\u2013498}} This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of [[electric potential difference]], and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points. An electric field has the special property that it is ''[[Conservative force|conservative]]'', which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated.<ref name=uniphysics/>{{rp|494\u2013498}} The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric potential difference that the term [[voltage]] sees greater everyday usage.\n\nFor practical purposes, it is useful to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the [[Earth]] itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name [[Ground (electricity)|earth]] or [[Ground (electricity)|ground]]. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged\u2014and unchargeable.<ref>\n{{Citation\n| first = Raymond A. | last = Serway\n| title = Serway's College Physics\n| publisher = Thomson Brooks\n| page = 500\n| year = 2006\n| isbn = 0-534-99724-4}}\n</ref>\n\nElectric potential is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar quantity]], that is, it has only magnitude and not direction.

Faraday's [[homopolar motor]] consisted of a [[permanent magnet]] sitting in a pool of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]].

Further analysis of this process, known as [[electromagnetic induction]], enabled him to state the principle, now known as [[Faraday's law of induction]], that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit is proportional to the rate of change of [[magnetic flux]] through the loop. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first [[electrical generator]] in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy.<ref name=iet_faraday/> [[Faraday's disc]] was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, a possibility that would be taken up by those that followed on from his work.\n\n===Electrochemistry===\n[[File:Volta-and-napoleon.PNG|thumb|right|[[Italy|Italian]] [[physicist]] [[Alessandro Volta]] showing his ''\"[[Battery (electricity)|battery]]\"'' to [[France|French]] [[emperor]] [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] in the early 19th century.]]\n{{main|Electrochemistry}}\nThe ability of chemical reactions to produce electricity, and conversely the ability of electricity to drive chemical reactions has a wide array of uses.\n\nElectrochemistry has always been an important part of electricity. From the initial invention of the Voltaic pile, [[electrochemical cell]]s have evolved into the many different types of batteries, electroplating and electrolysis cells.

[[Electronic circuit]]s contain [[active component]]s, usually [[semiconductor]]s, and typically exhibit [[non-linear]] behaviour, requiring complex analysis. The simplest electric components are those that are termed [[passivity (engineering)|passive]] and [[linear]]: while they may temporarily store energy, they contain no sources of it, and exhibit linear responses to stimuli.<ref name=Alexander>{{Citation  | last = Alexander  | first = Charles  | last2 = Sadiku  | first2 = Matthew  | title = Fundamentals of Electric Circuits  | publisher = McGraw-Hill  | year = 2006  | edition = 3, revised  |isbn = 9780073301150}}</ref>{{rp|15\u201316}}\n\nThe [[resistor]] is perhaps the simplest of passive circuit elements: as its name suggests, it [[Electrical resistance|resists]] the current through it, dissipating its energy as heat. The resistance is a consequence of the motion of charge through a conductor: in metals, for example, resistance is primarily due to collisions between electrons and ions. [[Ohm's law]] is a basic law of [[circuit theory]], stating that the current passing through a resistance is directly proportional to the potential difference across it. The resistance of most materials is relatively constant over a range of temperatures and currents; materials under these conditions are known as 'ohmic'. The [[ohm]], the unit of resistance, was named in honour of [[Georg Ohm]], and is symbolised by the Greek letter \u03a9. 1&nbsp;\u03a9 is the resistance that will produce a potential difference of one volt in response to a current of one amp.<ref name=Alexander/>{{rp|30\u201335}}\n\nThe [[capacitor]] is a development of the Leyden jar and is a device that can store charge, and thereby storing electrical energy in the resulting field. It consists of two conducting plates separated by a thin [[Insulator (electricity)|insulating]] [[dielectric]] layer; in practice, thin metal foils are coiled together, increasing the surface area per unit volume and therefore the [[capacitance]]. The unit of capacitance is the [[farad]], named after [[Michael Faraday]], and given the symbol ''F'': one farad is the capacitance that develops a potential difference of one volt when it stores a charge of one coulomb. A capacitor connected to a voltage supply initially causes a current as it accumulates charge; this current will however decay in time as the capacitor fills, eventually falling to zero. A capacitor will therefore not permit a [[steady state]] current, but instead blocks it.<ref name=Alexander/>{{rp|216\u2013220}}\n\nThe [[inductor]] is a conductor, usually a coil of wire, that stores energy in a magnetic field in response to the current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, [[electromagnetic induction|inducing]] a voltage between the ends of the conductor. The induced voltage is proportional to the [[Time derivative|time rate of change]] of the current. The constant of proportionality is termed the [[inductance]]. The unit of inductance is the [[Henry (unit)|henry]], named after [[Joseph Henry]], a contemporary of Faraday. One henry is the inductance that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it changes at a rate of one ampere per second. The inductor's behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor: it will freely allow an unchanging current, but opposes a rapidly changing one.<ref name=Alexander/>{{rp|226\u2013229}}\n\n===Electric power===\n{{main|electric power}}\nElectric power is the rate at which [[electric energy]] is transferred by an [[electric circuit]]. The [[SI]] unit of [[power (physics)|power]] is the [[watt (unit)|watt]], one [[joule]] per [[second]].\n\nElectric power, like [[power (physics)|mechanical power]], is the rate of doing [[work (electrical)|work]], measured in [[watt]]s, and represented by the letter ''P''. The term ''wattage'' is used colloquially to mean \"electric power in watts.\"  The electric power in [[watt]]s produced by an electric current ''I'' consisting of a charge of ''Q'' coulombs every ''t'' seconds passing through an [[electric potential]] ([[voltage]]) difference of ''V'' is\n:<math>P = \\text{work done per unit time} = \\frac {QV}{t} = IV \\,</math>\nwhere\n:''Q'' is electric charge in [[coulomb]]s\n:''t'' is time in seconds\n:''I'' is electric current in [[ampere]]s\n:''V'' is electric potential or voltage in [[volt]]s\n\n[[Electricity generation]] is often done with [[electric generator]]s, but can also be supplied by chemical sources such as [[electric batteries]] or by other means from a wide variety of sources of energy. Electric power is generally supplied to businesses and homes by the [[electric power industry]]. Electricity is usually sold by the [[kilowatt hour]] (3.6 MJ) which is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours.  Electric utilities measure power using [[electricity meter]]s, which keep a running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer. Unlike fossil fuels, electricity is a low [[entropy]] form of energy and can be converted into motion or many other forms of energy with high efficiency.<ref>Environmental Physics By Clare Smith 2001</ref>\n\n===Electronics===\n{{main|electronics}}\n[[File:Arduino ftdi chip-1.jpg|thumb|[[Surface-mount technology|Surface mount]] electronic components]]\nElectronics deals with [[electrical circuit]]s that involve [[active component|active electrical component]]s such as [[vacuum tube]]s, [[transistor]]s, [[diode]]s and [[integrated circuit]]s, and associated passive interconnection technologies. The [[nonlinear]] behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible and electronics is widely used in [[information processing]], [[telecommunications]], and [[signal processing]]. The ability of electronic devices to act as [[switch]]es makes digital information processing possible. Interconnection technologies such as [[circuit board]]s, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working [[system]].\n\nToday, most electronic devices use [[semiconductor]] components to perform electron control.

Thus, when either field is changing in time, then a field of the other is necessarily induced.<ref name=uniphysics/>{{rp|696\u2013700}} Such a phenomenon has the properties of a [[wave]], and is naturally referred to as an [[electromagnetic wave]]. Electromagnetic waves were analysed theoretically by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1864. Maxwell developed a set of equations that could unambiguously describe the interrelationship between electric field, magnetic field, electric charge, and electric current. He could moreover prove that such a wave would necessarily travel at the [[speed of light]], and thus light itself was a form of electromagnetic radiation. [[Maxwell's Laws]], which unify light, fields, and charge are one of the great milestones of theoretical physics.<ref name=uniphysics/>{{rp|696\u2013700}}\n\nThus, the work of many researchers enabled the use of electronics to convert signals into [[radio frequency|high frequency]] oscillating currents, and via suitably shaped conductors, electricity permits the transmission and reception of these signals via radio waves over very long distances.\n\n==Production and uses==\n\n===Generation and transmission===\n{{Main|Electricity generation}}\n{{See also|Electric power transmission|Mains electricity}}\n[[File:Gorskii 04414u.jpg|thumb|300px|Early 20th-century alternator made in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], in the power generating hall of a [[hydroelectric]] station (photograph by [[Prokudin-Gorsky]], 1905&ndash;1915).]]\n\nIn the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher [[Thales of Miletus]] experimented with amber rods and these experiments were the first studies into the production of electrical energy.

These results were known to [[Mary Shelley]] when she authored ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1819), although she does not name the method of revitalization of the monster. The revitalization of monsters with electricity later became a stock theme in horror films.\n\nAs the public familiarity with electricity as the lifeblood of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] grew, its wielders were more often cast in a positive light,<ref name=\"Van Riper 71\">Van Riper, op.cit., p. 71.</ref> such as the workers who \"finger death at their gloves' end as they piece and repiece the living wires\" in [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s 1907 poem ''[[Sons of Martha]]''.<ref name=\"Van Riper 71\" /> Electrically powered vehicles of every sort featured large in adventure stories such as those of [[Jules Verne]] and the ''[[Tom Swift]]'' books.<ref name=\"Van Riper 71\" /> The masters of electricity, whether fictional or real\u2014including scientists such as [[Thomas Edison]], [[Charles Steinmetz]] or [[Nikola Tesla]]\u2014were popularly conceived of as having wizard-like powers.<ref name=\"Van Riper 71\" />\n\nWith electricity ceasing to be a novelty and becoming a necessity of everyday life in the later half of the 20th century, it required particular attention by popular culture only when it ''stops'' flowing,<ref name=\"Van Riper 71\" /> an event that usually signals disaster.<ref name=\"Van Riper 71\" /> The people who ''keep'' it flowing, such as the nameless hero of [[Jimmy Webb]]\u2019s song \"[[Wichita Lineman]]\" (1968),<ref name=\"Van Riper 71\" /> are still often cast as heroic, wizard-like figures.<ref name=\"Van Riper 71\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy|Electronics}}\n\n* [[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law]], connects the direction of an electric current and its associated magnetic currents.\n* [[Electric potential energy]], the potential energy of a system of charges\n* [[Electricity market]], the sale of electrical energy\n* [[Hydraulic analogy]], an analogy between the flow of water and electric current\n\n==Notes==\n\n<!--See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref(erences/)> tags-->\n\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation\n| first1=Mahmood\n| last1=Nahvi\n| first2=Edminister \n| last2=Joseph\n| title=Electric Circuits\n| year=1965\n| publisher=McGraw-Hill\n| isbn=9780071422413 }}\n* {{citation\n| first=Percy | last = Hammond\n| title=Electromagnetism for Engineers\n| year=1981\n| publisher=Pergamon\n| isbn=0-08-022104-1\n| bibcode=1951Natur.168....4G\n| volume=168\n| pages=4\n| journal=Nature\n| doi=10.1038/168004b0\n| issue=4262 }}\n* {{citation\n| first=A.| last = Morely\n| first2=E.| last2 = Hughes\n| title=Principles of Electricity\n| edition = 5th\n| year=1994\n| publisher=Longman\n| isbn=0-582-22874-3}}\n* {{citation\n| first = M.S.| last = Naidu\n| first2 = V.| last2 = Kamataru\n| title = High Voltage Engineering\n| publisher = Tata McGraw-Hill\n| year = 1982\n| isbn = 0-07-451786-4}}\n* {{citation\n| first = James| last = Nilsson\n| first2 = Susan | last2 = Riedel\n| title = Electric Circuits\n| publisher = Prentice Hall\n| year = 2007\n| isbn = 978-0-13-198925-2}}\n* {{citation\n| first = Walter C. | last = Patterson\n| title = Transforming Electricity: The Coming Generation of Change\n| year = 1999\n| publisher = Earthscan\n| isbn = 1-85383-341-X}}\n* Benjamin, P.
