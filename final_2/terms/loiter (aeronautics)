The phase consists of [[Cruise (flight)|cruising]] for a certain amount of time over a small region.  The loiter phase occurs, for general aviation, generally at the end of the flight plan, normally when the plane is waiting for clearance to land.  \n\nIn military flights, such as [[aerial reconnaissance]] or [[Attack aircraft|ground-attack aircraft]], the loiter phase is time the aircraft has over a target. Cruise is the time period the aircraft travels to the target and returns after the loiter. \n\nIn [[astronautics]], the loiter phase of [[spacecraft]] used for [[human spaceflight]] may be as long as six months, as is the case for [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] spacecraft which remain docked while expedition crewmembers reside aboard the [[International Space Station]].\n\n==Endurance==\n\nThe [[endurance (aeronautics)|endurance]] of the aircraft during the loiter phase is calculated using the following ([[Breguet equation|Breguet formula]]):<ref>{{cite book|last=Obert|first=Ed|title=Aerodynamic Design of Transport Aircraft|year=2009|publisher=IOS Press|location=Delft|isbn=978-1-58603-970-7|pages=638}}</ref>\n:<math> E = \\frac{1}{C} \\frac{L}{D} \\ln \\left( \\frac{W_i}{W_f} \\right) </math>\nwhere:\n* <math> E \\,\\!</math> is the endurance (dimensions of Time)\n* <math> C \\,\\!</math> is the Specific Fuel Consumption (dimensions of 1/Time)\n* <math> L \\,\\!</math> is the total [[lift force]] on the aircraft\n* <math> D \\,\\!</math> is the total [[Drag (physics)|drag]] force on the aircraft\n* <math> W_i \\,\\!</math> is the weight of the aircraft at the start of the phase\n* <math> W_f \\,\\!</math> is the weight of the aircraft at the end of the phase\n\n==See also==\n* [[Endurance (aeronautics)]]\n* [[Bovingdon stack]], a holding pattern in the [[United Kingdom]]\n* [[Flight planning]]\n* [[Holding (aeronautics)|Holding]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Flight phases]]\n\n\n{{Aviation-stub}}"}]}}}}
