However, the virtual terminal protocol is not widely used on the Internet.\n\n==Virtual Terminals for payment card processing==\nThis term is also used to refer to web interfaces for processing [[card not present transaction]]s. Such terminals allow [[call centre]] agents to enter a customer's [[credit card]] details to take a payment.  KNown as card-not-present payments, merchants or customers enter credit card payment information within a terminal to complete payments.  This makes a Virtual Terminal the ideal solution for real estate agents, professional services, online payments and other industries.\n\n==Companies offering Virtual Terminal Services==\n[[PayPal]]   \n \n[[Helcim]]\n\n==Sources==\n*{{FS1037C}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Telnet]]\n*[[Secure Shell]]\n*[[Terminal emulator]] for an application program that provides access to virtual terminals\n*[[Pseudo terminal]] for the software interface that provides access to virtual terminals\n*[[Virtual console]] for an analogous concept that provides several ''local'' consoles\n\n[[Category:Computer terminals]]\n[[Category:ITU-T recommendations]]"}]}}}}
