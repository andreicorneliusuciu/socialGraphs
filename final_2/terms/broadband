The medium can be [[coaxial cable]], [[optical fiber]], [[radio]] or [[twisted pair]].\n\nIn the context of [[Internet access]], '''broadband''' is used to mean any high-speed Internet access that is always on and faster than traditional [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up access]].\n\n==Overview==\nDifferent criteria for \"broad\" have been applied in different contexts and at different times.

Whereas a [[passband]] signal is also modulated so that it occupies higher frequencies (compared to a ''baseband'' signal which is bound to the lowest end of the spectrum, see [[line coding]]), it is still occupying a single channel. The key difference is that what is typically considered a ''broadband signal'' in this sense is a signal that occupies multiple (non-masking, [[Orthogonality#Communications|orthogonal]]) passbands, thus allowing for much higher throughput over a single medium but with additional complexity in the transmitter/receiver circuitry.\n\nThe term became popularized through the 1990s as a marketing term for [[Internet access]] that was faster than [[dialup|dialup access]], the original Internet access technology, which was limited to 56 kbit/s. This meaning is only distantly related to its original technical meaning.\n\n== Broadband technologies ==\n\n=== Telecommunications ===\nIn [[telecommunications]], a broadband signaling method is one that handles a wide band of frequencies. \"Broadband\" is a [[relative term]], understood according to its context. The wider (or broader) the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of a channel, the greater the information-carrying capacity, given the same channel quality.\n\nIn [[radio]], for example, a very narrow band will carry [[Morse code]], a broader band will carry speech, and a still broader band will carry [[music]] without losing the high [[Audio frequency|audio frequencies]] required for realistic [[sound reproduction]]. This broad band is often divided into channels or \"frequency bins\" using [[passband]] techniques to allow [[frequency-division multiplexing]] instead of sending a higher-quality signal.\n\nIn data communications a [[56k modem]] will transmit a data rate of 56 kilobits per second (kbit/s) over a 4-kilohertz-wide [[telephone line]] (narrowband or [[voiceband]]). In the late 1980s, the [[Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network]] (B-ISDN) used the term to refer to a broad range of [[bit rate]]s, independent of physical modulation details.<ref name=\"bisdn\">{{cite web |author= Ender Ayanoglu |author2=Nail Akar |title=B-ISDN (Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network) |url=http://repositories.cdlib.org/cpcc/2/ |publisher=Center for Pervasive Communications and Computing, UC Irvine |accessdate= July 12, 2011 }}</ref> The various forms of [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL) services are ''broadband'' in the sense that digital information is sent over multiple channels.

Fiber optic allows the signal to be transmitted farther without being repeated. Cable companies use a hybrid system using fiber to transmit the signal to neighborhoods and then changes the signal from light to radio frequency to be transmitted to over coaxial cable to homes. Doing so reduces the use of having multiple head ends.  A [[Cable television headend|head end]] gathers all the information from the local cable networks and movie channels and then feeds the information into the system.\n\nHowever, \"broadband video\" in the context of [[Streaming media|streaming]] Internet video has come to mean video files that have [[bit rate#Bitrates in multimedia|bitrates]] high enough to require broadband Internet access for viewing. \"Broadband video\" is also sometimes used to describe [[IPTV]] [[Video on demand]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Mark Sweney |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/feb/07/bt.digitaltvradio |title=BT Vision boasts 150,000 customers &#124; Media |publisher=The Guardian |date=2008-02-07 |accessdate=2016-06-21}}</ref>\n\n===Alternative technologies===\n[[Power line communication|Power lines]] have also been used for various types of data communication. Although some systems for remote control are based on [[narrowband]] signaling, modern high-speed systems use broadband signaling to achieve very high data rates. One example is the [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] standard, which provides a way to create a [[local area network]] up to 1 Gigabit/s (which is considered high-speed as of 2014) using existing home wiring (including power lines, but also phone lines and [[Ethernet over coax|coaxial cables]]).\n\nIn 2014, researchers at [[Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology]] made developments on the creation of ultra-shallow broadband [[optical instruments]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2014-12-broadband-ultrathin-polarization.html |title=Broadband and ultrathin polarization manipulators developed |publisher=Phys.org |date=2014-12-04 |accessdate=2016-06-21}}</ref>\n\n==Internet Broadband==\n{{Main|Internet access}}\n\nIn the context of [[Internet access]], the term \"broadband\" is used loosely to mean \"access that is always on and faster than the traditional dial-up access\".<ref name=\"What is Broadband\">{{cite web |title= What is Broadband? |work= The National Broadband Plan |publisher= US Federal Communications Commission |url= http://www.broadband.gov/about_broadband.html/ |accessdate= July 15, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=Jeffrey A.|last2=Reed|first2=Robert R.|last3=Bar|first3=Fran\u00e7ois|title=The building of the internet|journal=Telecommunications Policy|date=November 1992|volume=16|issue=8|pages=666\u2013689|doi=10.1016/0308-5961(92)90061-S}}</ref>\n\nA range of more precise definitions of speed have been prescribed at times, including:\n* \"Greater than the [[Primary Rate Interface|primary rate]]\" (which ranged from about 1.5 to 2 Mbit/s) - [[ITU-T|CCITT]] in \"broadband service\" in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-I.113-199706-I!!PDF-E |title= Recommendation I.113, Vocabulary of Terms for Broadband aspects of ISDN |publisher= ITU-T |date= June 1997  |accessdate= 19 July 2011 }}</ref>\n* \"Internet access that is always on and faster than the traditional dial-up access\",<ref name=\"What is Broadband\"/>  - US [[National Broadband Plan (United States)|National Broadband Plan]] of 2009<ref>{{cite web |title= Inquiry Concerning the Deployment of Advanced Telecommunications Capability to All Americans in a Reasonable and Timely Fashion, and Possible Steps to Accelerate Such Deployment Pursuant to Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as Amended by the Broadband Data Improvement Act |publisher= Federal Communications Commission |work= GN Docket No. 10-159, FCC-10-148A1 |date= August 6, 2010 |url= http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2010/db0806/FCC-10-148A1.pdf |accessdate= July 12, 2011}}</ref>\n* 4 Mbit/s down, 1 Mbit/s up - FCC, 2010<ref name=FCC15 />\n* 25 Mbit/s down, 3 Mbit/s up - FCC, 2015<ref name=FCC15>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-finds-us-broadband-deployment-not-keeping-pace |title=FCC Finds U.S. Broadband Deployment Not Keeping Pace &#124; Federal Communications Commission |publisher=Fcc.gov |date=2015-02-04 |accessdate=2016-06-21}}</ref>\n\nBroadband Internet service is now effectively treated or managed as a [[public utility]] by [[Net neutrality in the United States|net neutrality]] rules.<ref name=\"NYT-20150312a\">{{cite news |last=Ruiz |first=Rebecca R. |title=F.C.C.
