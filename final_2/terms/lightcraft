Laser propulsion is in early stages of development.  Lightcraft uses an external source of [[laser]] or [[maser]] energy to provide power for producing thrust.  The laser/maser energy is focused to a high intensity in order to create a plasma.  The plasma expands, producing thrust.<ref name=nssv20100725/>\n\nA lightcraft is distinct from a [[solar sail]] because it is dependent on the expansion of [[reaction mass]] to accelerate rather than being accelerated by [[radiation pressure|light pressure]] alone.\n\n==Types==\n\nIn one type of lightcraft, the laser shines on a [[parabolic reflector]] on the underside of the vehicle that concentrates the light to produce a region of extremely high temperature. The air in this region becomes heated and expands violently in a laser-supported detonation, producing thrust.  \n\nIn other lightcraft concepts, the laser arrives at the vehicle from above, and operates as an ablative laser [[tractor beam]].<ref name=\"Laser Ablation Propulsion Tractor Beam System\">{{cite news | last =Sinko | first =John | title =Laser Ablation Propulsion Tractor Beam System | work =[[Journal of Propulsion and Power]] | date =September 17, 2010|url=http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/1.46037 |accessdate=2010-09-17 }}</ref> This may have applications in the removal of [[space debris]].<ref name=\"Laser Beams to Clean Up Space Junk\">{{cite news | last =Shane | title =Laser Beams to Clean Up Space Junk | work =[[GoArticles.com]] | date =September 17, 2010|url=http://www.goarticles.com/cgi-bin/showa.cgi?C=3032401 |accessdate=2010-09-17 }}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n\nWhen a lightcraft is in the atmosphere, air is used as the propellant material (reaction mass).  In space, a lightcraft would need to provide the propellant material from onboard tanks or from an [[ablation|ablative]] solid.  By leaving the vehicle's power source on the ground and by using ambient atmosphere as reaction mass for much of its ascent, a lightcraft could potentially be capable of delivering a very large percentage of its launch mass to orbit. It could also potentially be inexpensive to manufacture.\n\nAt the current stage of development, the bottom-lasered type of lightcraft exist as small hand-sized test specimens which have attained altitudes of a few hundred feet.  In 1999, tests by [[Leik Myrabo]] in cooperation with the [[United States Army|US Army]] at [[White Sands Missile Range]] demonstrated the basic feasibility of using ground-based lasers to propel objects in this way. The test succeeded in reaching over one hundred feet, which compares to [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]]'s first test flight of his rocket design.  In 2000, a new flight record was set with a flight lasting 10.5 seconds and reaching 72 meters (236&nbsp;feet).<ref name=nssv20100725>\n[http://www.hobbyspace.com/nucleus/index.php?itemid=22338 Approaching Warp Speed: Advanced Space Propulsion], NewSpace 2010 conference panel discussion, 2010-07-25, Lightcraft segment, Leik Myrabo - [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], ''[[Spacevidcast#NewSpace_2010_.282010.29|Spacevidcast]]'' video, at time 10:00-32:00, accessed 2010-07-30.</ref>\n\nA lightcraft's propulsion is dependent on the external laser's power and so propulsive power is not limited to that generated by on-board machinery (rockets).<ref name=nssv20100725/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal| Spaceflight }}\n* [[Elevator:2010]]\n* [[Non-rocket spacelaunch]]\n** [[Beam-powered propulsion]]\n* [[Solar sail|Light sail]]\n* [[Space elevator]]\n* [[List of laser articles]]\n* [[List of plasma (physics) articles]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.eng.rpi.edu/soe/directory_faculty_details.cfm?facultyID=myrabl Prof. Leik N.
