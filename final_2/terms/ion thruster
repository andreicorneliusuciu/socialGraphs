It creates [[thrust]] by accelerating [[ion]]s with [[electricity]]. The term refers strictly to gridded [[electrostatic ion thruster]]s, but may more loosely be applied to all electric propulsion systems that accelerate [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], since plasma consists of ions.\n\nIon thrusters are categorized by how they accelerate the ions, using either [[electrostatic]] or [[electromagnetic]] force. Electrostatic thrusters use the [[Coulomb force]] and accelerate the ions in the direction of the [[electric field]]. Electromagnetic thrusters use the [[Lorentz force]]. In either case, when an ion passes through an electrostatic grid engine, the [[voltage|potential difference]] of the [[electric field]] converts to the ion's [[kinetic energy]].\n\nIon thrusters have an input [[power (physics)|power]] need of 1\u20137&nbsp;kW, [[exhaust velocity]] 20\u201350&nbsp;km/s, thrust 25\u2013250 [[millinewton]]s and [[efficiency]] 65\u201380%.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://alfven.princeton.edu/publications/choueiri-sciam-2009 Choueiri, Edgar Y.

The [[power (physics)|power]] imparted to the exhaust increases with the square of exhaust velocity while thrust increase is linear. Conversely, chemical rockets provide high thrust, but are limited in total [[impulse (physics)|impulse]] by the small amount of [[energy]] that can be stored chemically in the propellants.<ref>[http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=34201&fbodylongid=1535 Electric Spacecraft Propulsion, Electric versus Chemical Propulsion], ESA Science & Technology</ref> Given the practical weight of suitable power sources, the acceleration from an ion thruster is frequently less than one thousandth of [[standard gravity]]. However, since they operate as electric (or electrostatic) motors, they convert a greater fraction of input power into kinetic exhaust power. Chemical rockets operate as [[heat engine]]s, and [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's theorem]] limits the exhaust velocity.\n\nIon thrust engines are practical only in the vacuum of space and cannot take vehicles through the atmosphere because ion engines do not work in the presence of ions outside the engine. Spacecraft rely on conventional chemical rockets to initially reach [[orbit]].\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:SERT-1 spacecraft.jpg|thumb|right|SERT-1 spacecraft]]\n\nThe first person to mention the idea publicly was [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] in 1911.<ref name=choueiri /> However, the first document to consider electric propulsion is [[Robert H.

The method of accelerating the ions varies, but all designs take advantage of the [[electric charge|charge]]/[[mass]] ratio of the ions. This ratio means that relatively small potential differences can create high exhaust velocities. This reduces the amount of [[reaction mass]] or propellant required, but increases the amount of specific [[power (physics)|power]] required compared to [[chemical rocket]]s. Ion thrusters are therefore able to achieve high [[specific impulse]]s. The drawback of the low thrust is low acceleration because the mass of the electric power unit directly correlates with the amount of power. This low thrust makes ion thrusters unsuited for launching spacecraft into orbit, but effective for in-space propulsion.\n\nIon thrusters are categorized as either [[electrostatics|electrostatic]] or [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]]. The main difference is the method for accelerating the ions.\n*Electrostatic ion thrusters use the [[Coulomb force]] and accelerate the ions in the direction of the electric field.\n*Electromagnetic ion thrusters use the [[Lorentz force]] to move the ions.\n\nPower supplies for ion thrusters are usually electric [[solar panel|solar panels,]] but at sufficiently large distances from the sun, nuclear power is used. In each case, the power supply mass is proportional to the peak power that can be supplied, and both provide, for this application, no limit to the energy.\n\nElectric thrusters tend to produce low thrust, which results in low acceleration. Using 1&nbsp;g is 9.81&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>; F = m a \u21d2 a = F/m. An [[NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness|NSTAR]] thruster producing a thrust (force) of 92&nbsp;mN<ref name=ns20070928/> will accelerate a satellite with a mass of 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;kg by 0.092&nbsp;N / 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;kg = {{gaps|0.000|092}}&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> (or 9.38{{e|\u22126}}&nbsp;g).\n\nF = 2*\u03b7*P/(g * I<sub>sp</sub>)\n<br />Where\n: F is the thrust (force) in N,\n: \u03b7 is the efficiency, a dimensionless value between 0 and 1 (70% efficiency is 0.7),\n: P is the electrical power energy going into the thruster in W,\n: g is a constant, the acceleration due to gravity 9.81&nbsp;m/s<sup>2,</sup>\n: I<sub>sp</sub> is the [[specific impulse]] in s.\n\n==Electrostatic ion thrusters==\n\n===Gridded electrostatic ion thrusters===\n{{main|Gridded ion thruster}}\n\n[[File:Ion engine.svg|thumb|right|300px|Figure 2: A diagram of how a gridded electrostatic ion engine (multipole magnetic cusp type) works]]\n'''[[Gridded ion thruster|Gridded electrostatic ion thrusters]]''' commonly utilize [[xenon]] gas. This gas has no charge and is [[ionization|ionized]] by bombarding it with energetic electrons. These electrons can be provided from a hot [[cathode]] [[electrical filament|filament]] and when accelerated in the electrical field of the cathode, fall to the anode. Alternatively, the electrons can be accelerated by the oscillating electric field induced by an alternating magnetic field of a coil, which results in a self-sustaining discharge without a cathode (radio frequency ion thruster).\n\nThe positively charged ions are extracted by an extraction system consisting of 2 or 3 multi-aperture grids. After entering the grid system by the plasma sheath, the ions are accelerated by the potential difference between the first and second grid (named screen and accelerator grid) to the final ion energy of (typically) 1\u20132 keV, generating the thrust.\n\nIon thrusters emit a beam of positive charged xenon ions only. To avoid charging up the spacecraft, another [[cathode]] is placed near the engine to emit an electron current into the ion beam with net neutral electrostatic charge.<ref name=\"Glenn\" /> This prevents the beam of ions from being attracted (and returning) to the spacecraft, cancelling the thrust.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nGridded electrostatic ion thruster research (past/present):\n*[[NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness]] (NSTAR) - 2,3&nbsp;kW, used on two successful missions\n*NASA\u2019s Evolutionary Xenon Thruster ([[NEXT (ion thruster)|NEXT]]) - 6,9&nbsp;kW, flight qualification hardware built\n*Nuclear Electric Xenon Ion System (NEXIS)\n*High Power Electric Propulsion ([[HiPEP]]) - 25&nbsp;kW, test example built and run briefly on the ground\n*EADS Radio-Frequency Ion Thruster (RIT)\n*[[Dual-Stage 4-Grid]] (DS4G)<ref>{{cite press release |title =ESA and ANU make space propulsion breakthrough |publisher = ESA |date =2006-01-11 |url = http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMOSTG23IE_index_0.html |accessdate = 2007-06-29 |quote = }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://prl.anu.edu.au/SP3/research/SAFEandDS4G/webstory |title=ANU and ESA make space propulsion breakthrough |accessdate=2007-06-30 |author=ANU Space Plasma, Power & Propulsion Group (SP3) |authorlink= |date=2006-12-06 |work=DS4G Web Story |publisher=The Australian National University |pages= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070627103001/http://prl.anu.edu.au/SP3/research/SAFEandDS4G/webstory <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-27 |quote= }}</ref>\n\n===Hall effect thrusters===\n{{main|Hall effect thruster}}\n\n[[File:Wfm hall thruster.svg|300px|thumb|Schematic of a Hall Thruster]]\n'''[[Hall effect thruster]]s''' accelerate ions by means of an electric potential between a cylindrical anode and a negatively charged plasma that forms the cathode. The bulk of the propellant (typically xenon) is introduced near the anode, where it ionizes and flows toward the cathode; ions accelerate towards and through it, picking up electrons as they leave to neutralize the beam and leave the thruster at high velocity.\n\nThe anode is at one end of a cylindrical tube. In the center is a spike that is wound to produce a radial magnetic field between it and the surrounding tube. The ions are largely unaffected by the magnetic field, since they are too massive. However, the electrons produced near the end of the spike to create the cathode are trapped by the magnetic field and held in place by their attraction to the anode. Some of the electrons spiral down towards the anode, circulating around the spike in a Hall current. When they reach the anode they impact the uncharged propellant and cause it to be ionized, before finally reaching the anode and closing the circuit.<ref name=\"Oleson\">{{cite web |url=http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2001/TM-2001-210676.pdf|title=Advanced Hall Electric Propulsion for Future In-Space Transportation|accessdate=2007-11-21|last1= Oleson |first1= S.

The design comprises a small propellant reservoir that stores the liquid metal, a narrow tube or a system of parallel plates that the liquid flows through and an accelerator (a ring or an elongated aperture in a metallic plate) about a millimeter past the tube end. Caesium and indium are used due to their high atomic weights, low ionization potentials and low melting points. Once the liquid metal reaches the end of the tube, an electric field applied between the emitter and the accelerator causes the liquid surface to deform into a series of protruding cusps (\"[[Taylor cone]]s\"). At a sufficiently high applied voltage, positive ions are extracted from the tips of the cones.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alta-space.com/index.php?page=feep|title=FEEP - Field-Emission Electric Propulsion|accessdate=2012-04-27}}</ref><ref name=\"JPP98\">{{cite web |url=http://www.alta-space.com/uploads/file/publications/feep/Marcuccio-JPP14_5_1998.pdf|title=Experimental Performance of Field Emission Microthrusters|author=Marcuccio, S.|display-authors=etal|accessdate=2012-04-27}}</ref><ref name=\"Nasa\">{{cite web |url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/11649/1/02-0194.pdf|title=In-FEEP Thruster Ion Beam Neutralization with Thermionic and Field Emission Cathodes|quote=liquid state and wicked up the needle shank to the tip where high electric fields deform the liquid and extract ions and accelerate them up to 130 km/s through 10 kV.|accessdate=2007-11-21|first1= Colleen |last1= Marrese-Reading |first2= Jay |last2= Polk |first3= Juergen |last3=Mueller |first4= Al |last4= Owens}}</ref> The electric field created by the emitter and the accelerator then accelerates the ions.

PITs consist of a large [[electromagnetic coil|coil]] encircling a cone shaped tube that emits the propellant gas. [[Ammonia]] is the gas commonly used. For each pulse, a large charge builds up in a group of capacitors behind the coil and is then released. This creates a current that moves circularly in the direction of j\u03b8. The current then creates a magnetic field in the outward radial direction (Br), which then creates a current in the gas that has just been released in the opposite direction of the original current. This opposite current ionizes the ammonia. The positively charged ions are accelerated away from the engine due to the electric field j\u03b8 crossing the magnetic field Br, due to the Lorentz Force.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2003/CR-2003-212714.pdf|title=Pulsed Inductive Thruster (PIT): Modeling and Validation Using the MACH2 Code|accessdate=2007-11-21|first=Pavlos G. |last= Mikellides}}</ref>\n\n===Magnetoplasmadynamic / Lithium Lorentz force accelerator===\n{{main|Magnetoplasmadynamic thruster}}\n[[Magnetoplasmadynamic thruster|Magnetoplasmadynamic]] (MPD) thrusters and lithium Lorentz force accelerator (LiLFA) thrusters use roughly the same idea. The LiLFA thruster builds off of the MPD thruster. [[Hydrogen]], [[argon]], [[ammonia]] and [[nitrogen]] can be used as propellant. In a certain configuration, the ambient gas in [[Low Earth Orbit]] (LEO) can be used as a propellant. The gas enters the main chamber where it is ionized into [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] by the electric field between the [[anode]] and the [[cathode]]. This plasma then conducts electricity between the anode and the cathode, closing the circuit. This new current creates a magnetic field around the cathode, which crosses with the electric field, thereby accelerating the plasma due to the Lorentz force.\n\nThe LiLFA thruster uses the same general idea as the MPD thruster, with two main differences. First, the LiLFA uses lithium vapor, which can be stored as a solid. The other difference is that the single cathode is replaced by multiple, smaller cathode rods packed into a hollow cathode tube. MPD cathodes are easily corroded due to constant contact with the plasma. In the LiLFA thruster the lithium vapor is injected into the hollow cathode and is not ionized to its plasma form/corrode the cathode rods until it exits the tube. The plasma is then accelerated using the same Lorentz Force.<ref name=\"Sankaran\">{{cite web |url=http://alfven.princeton.edu/publications/sankaran-icnta-2003|title=A Survey of Propulsion Options for Cargo and Piloted Missions to Mars|accessdate=2016-10-18|first1=K. |last1=Sankaran |first2= L. |last2= Cassady |first3= A.D. |last3= Kodys |first4= E.Y. |last4= Choueiri}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2001/CR-2001-211114.pdf |title=High Power MPD Thruster Development at the NASA Glenn Research Center |accessdate=2007-11-21 |first1=Michael R. |last1=LaPointe |first2=Pavlos G. |last2=Mikellides |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011063710/http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2001/CR-2001-211114.pdf |archivedate=October 11, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/31061/33887503.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Utilization of Ambient Gas as a Propellant for Low Earth Orbit Electric Propulsion |date=May 22, 1999 |first=Buford Ray |last=Conley |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174257/http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/31061/33887503.pdf?sequence=1 |archivedate=June 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 Russian company the [[Chemical Automatics Design Bureau]] successfully conducted a bench test of their MPD engine for long-distance space travel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sdelanounas.ru/blogs/44948|title=\"\u0412 \u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0436\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0434\u043b\u044f \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0430\" \u0432 \u0431\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0435 \"\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438, \u041d\u0418\u041e\u041a\u0420\u044b, \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\" -  \u0421\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0441|work=\u0421\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0441}}</ref>\n\n===Electrodeless plasma thrusters===\n{{main|Electrodeless plasma thruster}}\n[[Electrodeless plasma thruster]]s have two unique features: the removal of the anode and cathode electrodes and the ability to throttle the engine. The removal of the electrodes eliminates erosion, which limits lifetime on other ion engines. Neutral gas is first ionized by [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] and then transferred to another chamber where it is accelerated by an oscillating electric and magnetic field, also known as the [[ponderomotive force]]. This separation of the ionization and acceleration stages allows throttling of propellant flow, which then changes the thrust magnitude and specific impulse values.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elwingcorp.com/files/IEPC05-article.pdf| title= Development of a High Power Electrodeless Thruster|accessdate=2007-11-21|first= Gregory D. |last= Emsellem}}</ref>\n\n===Helicon double layer thrusters===\n{{main|Helicon double-layer thruster}}\nA helicon double layer thruster is a type of plasma thruster that ejects high velocity [[ionized]] gas to provide [[thrust]]. In this design, gas is injected into a tubular chamber (the ''source tube'') with one open end. [[Radio frequency]] AC power (at [[ISM band|13,56&nbsp;MHz]] in the prototype design) is coupled into a specially shaped [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] wrapped around the chamber. The [[electromagnetic wave]] emitted by the antenna causes the gas to break down and form a plasma. The antenna then excites a [[helicon (physics)|helicon wave]] in the plasma, which further heats it. The device has a roughly constant [[magnetic field]] in the source tube (supplied by [[solenoids]] in the prototype), but the magnetic field diverges and rapidly decreases in magnitude away from the source region and might be thought of as a kind of magnetic [[nozzle]]. In operation, a sharp boundary separates the high density plasma inside the source region and the low density plasma in the exhaust, which is associated with a sharp change in electrical potential. Plasma properties change rapidly across this boundary, which is known as a ''current-free electric [[double layer (plasma)|double layer]]''. The electrical potential is much higher inside the source region than in the exhaust and this serves both to confine most of the electrons and to accelerate the ions away from the source region. Enough electrons escape the source region to ensure that the plasma in the exhaust is neutral overall.\n\n=== VASIMR ===\n{{main|Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket}}\n\nVASIMR, or Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket, works by using [[radio waves]] to ionize a [[propellant]] into a plasma and then a [[magnetic field]] to accelerate the plasma out of the back of the [[rocket engine]] to generate thrust.\nThe VASIMR is currently being developed by the private company [[Ad Astra Rocket Company]], headquartered in Houston, TX with of help from a NS Canada based company [[Nautel]], producing the 200&nbsp;kW RF generators for ionizing propellant. Some of the components and \"Plasma Shoots\" experiments are tested in a laboratory settled in [[Liberia, Costa Rica]].\nThis project is led by former NASA astronaut Dr. [[Franklin Chang-D\u00edaz]] (CRC-USA).\nRecently the Costa Rican Aerospace Alliance announced its cooperation with this project by developing an exterior support device for the VASIMR to be fitted in the exterior of the [[International Space Station]], as part of the plan to test the VASIMR in space, this test phase is now expected to be conducted in 2016. The supposed 200 megawatt engine could reduce the duration of flight from Earth to Jupiter or Saturn from six years to fourteen months, and Mars from 6 months to 39 days.<ref>Zyga, Lisa (2009).

particular mission. Ion thrusters are designed to provide continuous operation for intervals of weeks to years.\n\nThe lifetime of electrostatic ion thrusters is limited by several processes. In electrostatic gridded designs, charge-exchange ions produced by the beam ions with the neutral gas flow can be accelerated towards the negatively biased accelerator grid and cause grid erosion. End-of-life is reached when either the grid structure fails or the holes in the grid become large enough that ion extraction is substantially affected; e.g., by the occurrence of electron backstreaming. Grid erosion cannot be avoided and is the major lifetime-limiting factor. Thorough grid design and material selection enable lifetimes of 20&nbsp;000 hours or more.\n\nA test of the [[NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness]] (NSTAR) electrostatic ion thruster resulted in 30&nbsp;472 hours (roughly 3,5 years) of continuous thrust at maximum power. Post-test examination indicated the engine was not approaching failure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/39521/1/05-2793.pdf|title=Destructive Physical Analysis of Hollow Cathodes from the Deep Space 1 Flight Spare Ion Engine 30,000 Hr Life Test|accessdate=2007-11-21}}</ref>\n\nThe NASA Evolutionary Xenon Thruster (NEXT) Project operated continuously for more than 48 000 hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spacefellowship.com/news/art34276/nasa-thruster-achieves-world-record-5-years-of-operation.html|title=NASA Thruster Achieves World-Record 5+ Years of Operation|accessdate=2012-06-27}}</ref> The test was conducted in a high vacuum test chamber. Over the course of the 5 1/2 + year test, the engine consumed approximately 870 kilograms of xenon propellant. The total impulse generated would require over 10,000 kilograms of conventional rocket propellant for a similar application.\n\nHall thrusters suffer from strong erosion of the ceramic discharge chamber by impact of energetic ions: a test reported in 2010<ref name=\"leipzig\">{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-leipzig.de/~iom/muehlleithen/2010/Bundesmann_2010.pdf |title=A closer look at a stationary plasma thruster}}</ref> showed erosion of around 1&nbsp;mm per hundred hours of operation, though this is inconsistent with observed on-orbit lifetimes of a few thousand hours.\n\nNASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]'s ion drives have provided continuous operation of more than 3 years.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=\"Choueiri\"/>\n\n==Propellants==\n[[Ionization]] energy represents a large percentage of the energy needed to run ion drives. The ideal propellant is thus easy to ionize and has a high mass/ionization energy ratio. In addition, the propellant should not erode the thruster to any great degree to permit long life; and should not contaminate the vehicle.<ref>Rocket Propulsion Elements&nbsp;\u2014 Sutton & Biblarz 7th edition</ref>\n\nMany current designs use [[xenon]] gas, as it is easy to ionize, has a reasonably high atomic number, is inert and causes low erosion. However, xenon is globally in short supply and expensive.\n\nOlder designs used [[mercury (element)|mercury]], but this is toxic and expensive, tended to contaminate the vehicle with the metal and was difficult to feed accurately.\n\nOther propellants, such as [[bismuth]] and [[iodine]], show promise, particularly for gridless designs, such as Hall effect thrusters.<ref name=Bi-Szabo/><ref name=I2-Szabo/><ref name=I2_hp-Szabo/>\n\n[[VASIMR]] design (and other plasma-based engines) are theoretically able to use practically any material for propellant. However, in current tests the most practical propellant is [[argon]], which is relatively abundant and inexpensive.\n\nThe CubeSat Ambipolar Thruster (CAT) used on the Mars Array of Ionospheric Research Satellites Using the CubeSat Ambipolar Thruster (MARS-CAT) mission proposes to use solid [[Iodine]] as the propellant to minimize storage volume.<ref name=\"MARS-CAT\"/>\n\n==Energy efficiency==\n[[File:Average propulsive efficiency of rockets.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Plot of instantaneous propulsive efficiency (blue) and overall efficiency for a vehicle accelerating from rest (red) as percentages of the engine efficiency- note that peak vehicle efficiency occurs at about 1,6 times exhaust velocity.]]\nIon thruster efficiency is the kinetic energy of the exhaust jet emitted per second divided by the electrical power into the device.\n\nOverall system energy efficiency is determined by the [[propulsive efficiency]], which depends on vehicle speed and exhaust speed. Some thrusters can vary exhaust speed in operation, but all can be designed with different exhaust speeds. At the lower end of I<sub>sps</sub> the overall efficiency drops, because ionization takes up a larger percentage energy and at the high end propulsive efficiency is reduced.\n\nOptimal efficiencies and exhaust velocities for any given mission can be calculated to give minimum overall cost.\n\n==Missions==\nIon thrusters have many in-space propulsion applications. The best applications make use of the long mission interval when significant [[thrust]] is not needed. Examples of this include orbit transfers, [[attitude dynamics and control|attitude]] adjustments, [[drag (physics)|drag]] compensation for [[low Earth orbit]]s, fine adjustments for scientific missions and cargo transport between [[propellant depot]]s, e.g., for chemical fuels. Ion thrusters can also be used for interplanetary and deep-space missions where acceleration rates are not crucial. Continuous thrust over a long interval can reach high velocities while consuming far less fuel than traditional chemical rockets.\n\nAmong electric thrusters, ion thrusters have received the most serious commercial and academic consideration. Ion thrusters are seen as the best solution for these missions, as they require high change in velocity but do not require rapid acceleration.\n\n===Demonstration vehicles===\n\n====SERT====\nIon propulsion systems were first demonstrated in space by the [[NASA Glenn Research Center|NASA Lewis]] (now Glenn Research Center) missions \"[[SERT-1|Space Electric Rocket Test\" (SERT)]] I and II.<ref name=\"Sovey\">{{cite journal| first1= J.
