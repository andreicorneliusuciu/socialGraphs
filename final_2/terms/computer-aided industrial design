The model can then be saved in STL format to send it to a [[rapid prototyping]] machine to create the real-life model.  CAID helps the designer to focus on the technical part of the design methodology rather than taking care of sketching and modeling\u2014then contributing to the selection of a better product proposal in less time.  Later, when the requisites and parameters of the product have been defined by means of using CAID software, the designer can import the result of his work into a CAD program (typically a Solid Modeler) for adjustments prior to production and generation of blueprints and manufacturing processes.\n\nWhat differentiates CAID from CAD is that the former is far more conceptual and less technical than the latter.  Within a CAID program, the designer can express him/herself without extents, whilst in CAD software there is always the manufacturing factor.\nCAD implementations have evolved dramatically since then. Initially, with 3D in the 1970s, it was typically limited to producing drawings similar to hand-drafted drawings. Advances in programming and computer hardware,[21][22] notably solid modeling in the 1980s, have allowed more versatile applications of computers in design activities.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Design}}\n* [[Industrial Design]]\n* [[Freeform surface modelling]]\n* [[Manufacturing|Production]]\n* [[Injection molding]]\n* [[Automobile design]](Y)\n* [[StudioTools|AliasStudio]], [[CATIA Shape Design and Styling]], [[NX (Unigraphics)|NX Shape Studio]], [[solidThinking]], [[Rhinoceros 3D|Rhinoceros]],  examples of CAID software\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.asis.org/Conferences/MY98/Evans.htm ASIS proceedings on CAID]\n* [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=279457&coll=portal&dl=ACM ACM Siggraph abstract on CAID]\n\n{{CAD software}}\n{{Design}}\n\n[[Category:Product lifecycle management]]\n[[Category:Industrial design]]"}]}}}}
