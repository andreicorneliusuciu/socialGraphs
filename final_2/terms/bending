P. and Schmidt, R. J. and Sidebottom, O. M., 1993, '''Advanced mechanics of materials''', John Wiley and Sons, New York.</ref> When the length is considerably longer than the width and the thickness, the element is called a [[Beam (structure)|beam]]. For example, a [[closet]] rod [[Deflection (engineering)|sagging]] under the weight of clothes on [[clothes hanger]]s is an example of a beam experiencing bending. On the other hand, a [[wikt:shell|shell]] is a structure of any geometric form where the length and the width are of the same order of magnitude but the thickness of the structure (known as the 'wall') is considerably smaller. A large diameter, but thin-walled, short tube supported at its ends and loaded laterally is an example of a shell experiencing bending.\n\nIn the absence of a qualifier, the term ''bending'' is ambiguous because bending can occur locally in all objects. Therefore, to make the usage of the term more precise, engineers refer to a specific object such as; the ''bending of rods'',<ref name=Libai/> the ''bending of beams'',<ref name=Boresi/> the ''[[bending of plates]]'',<ref name=Timo>[[Stephen Timoshenko|Timoshenko, S.]] and Woinowsky-Krieger, S., 1959, '''Theory of plates and shells''', McGraw-Hill.</ref> the ''[[Plate theory|bending of shells]]''<ref name=Libai>Libai, A. and Simmonds, J. G., 1998, '''The nonlinear theory of elastic shells''', Cambridge University Press.</ref> and so on.\n\n== Quasi-static bending of beams ==\nA beam deforms and stresses develop inside it when a transverse load is applied on it. In the quasi-static case, the amount of bending [[deflection (engineering)|deflection]] and the stresses that develop are assumed not to change over time. In a horizontal beam supported at the ends and loaded downwards in the middle, the material at the over-side of the beam is compressed while the material at the underside is stretched. There are two forms of internal stresses caused by lateral loads:\n* [[Shear stress]] parallel to the lateral loading plus complementary shear stress on planes perpendicular to the load direction;\n* Direct [[compressive stress]] in the upper region of the beam, and direct [[tensile stress]] in the lower region of the beam.\n\nThese last two forces form a [[Couple (mechanics)|couple]] or [[Moment (physics)|moment]] as they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. This [[bending moment]] resists the sagging deformation characteristic of a beam experiencing bending. The stress distribution in a beam can be predicted quite accurately when some simplifying assumptions are used.<ref name=Boresi />\n\n=== Euler\u2013Bernoulli bending theory ===\n{{main|Euler\u2013Bernoulli beam equation}}\n[[File:Poutre rayon courbure.svg|thumb|360px|Element of a bent beam: the fibers form concentric arcs, the top fibers are compressed and bottom fibers stretched.]]\n[[File:Poutre moment flechissant et courbure.svg|thumb|360px|Bending moments in a beam]]\n\nIn the [[Euler\u2013Bernoulli beam equation|Euler\u2013Bernoulli theory]] of slender beams, a major assumption is that 'plane sections remain plane'. In other words, any deformation due to shear across the section is not accounted for (no shear deformation). Also, this linear distribution is only applicable if the maximum stress is less than the [[yield stress]] of the material. For stresses that exceed yield, refer to article [[plastic bending]]. At yield, the maximum stress experienced in the section (at the furthest points from the [[neutral axis]] of the beam) is defined as the [[flexural strength]].\n\nConsider beams where the following are true: \n* The beam is originally straight and slender, and any taper is slight\n* The material is isotropic (or [[Orthotropic_material|orthotropic]]), [[Hooke's law#General application to elastic materials|linear elastic]], and [[homogeneous]] across any cross section (but not necessarily along its length)\n* Only small deflections are considered\n\nIn this case, the equation describing beam deflection (<math>w</math>) can be approximated as:\n:<math>\\cfrac{\\mathrm{d}^2 w(x)}{\\mathrm{d} x^2}=\\frac{M(x)}{E(x) I(x)}</math>\n\nwhere the second derivative of its deflected shape with respect to <math>x</math> is interpreted as its curvature, <math>E</math> is the [[Young's modulus]], <math>I</math> is the [[area moment of inertia]] of the cross-section, and <math>M</math> is the internal bending moment in the beam.\n\nIf, in addition, the beam is [[homogeneous]] along its length as well, and not tapered (i.e. constant cross section), and deflects under an applied transverse load <math>q(x)</math>, it can be shown that:<ref name=Boresi />\n:<math>\nEI~\\cfrac{\\mathrm{d}^4 w(x)}{\\mathrm{d} x^4} = q(x)\n</math>\nThis is the Euler-Bernoulli equation for beam bending.\n\nAfter a solution for the displacement of the beam has been obtained, the bending moment (<math>M</math>) and shear force (<math>Q</math>) in the beam can be calculated using the relations\n:<math>\nM(x) = -EI~\\cfrac{\\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\\mathrm{d} x^2} ~;~~ Q(x) = \\cfrac{\\mathrm{d}M}{\\mathrm{d}x}.\n</math>\n\nSimple beam bending is often analyzed with the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. The conditions for using simple bending theory are:<ref>Shigley J, \"Mechanical Engineering Design\", p44, International Edition, pub McGraw Hill, 1986, ISBN 0-07-100292-8</ref>\n# The beam is subject to [[pure bending]]. This means that the [[shear force]] is zero, and that no torsional or axial loads are present.\n# The material is [[isotropic]] (or [[Orthotropic_material|orthotropic]]) and [[homogeneous space|homogeneous]].\n# The material obeys [[Hooke's law]] (it is linearly elastic and will not deform plastically).\n# The beam is initially straight with a cross section that is constant throughout the beam length.\n# The beam has an axis of symmetry in the plane of bending.\n# The proportions of the beam are such that it would fail by bending rather than by crushing, wrinkling or sideways [[buckling]].\n# Cross-sections of the beam remain plane during bending.\n\n[[File:Poutre flexion deviee.svg|thumb|400px|Deflection of a beam deflected symmetrically and principle of superposition]]\nCompressive and tensile forces develop in the direction of the beam axis under bending loads. These forces induce [[Stress (physics)|stresses]] on the beam. The maximum compressive stress is found at the uppermost edge of the beam while the maximum tensile stress is located at the lower edge of the beam. Since the stresses between these two opposing [[wikt:Maximum|maxima]] vary [[linear]]ly, there therefore exists a point on the linear path between them where there is no bending stress. The [[Locus (mathematics)|locus]] of these points is the neutral axis. Because of this area with no stress and the adjacent areas with low stress, using uniform cross section beams in bending is not a particularly efficient means of supporting a load as it does not use the full capacity of the beam until it is on the brink of collapse. Wide-flange beams ([[i-Beam|{{ibeam}}-beam]]s) and [[truss]] [[girder]]s effectively address this inefficiency as they minimize the amount of material in this under-stressed region.\n\nThe classic formula for determining the bending stress in a beam under simple bending is:<ref name=Gere>Gere, J. M. and Timoshenko, S.P., 1997, '''Mechanics of Materials''', PWS Publishing Company.</ref>\n:<math>{\\sigma_x}= \\frac{M_z y}{I_z}</math>\nwhere\n*<math>{\\sigma_x}</math> is the bending stress\n*''<math>M_z</math>'' - the moment about the neutral axis\n*''<math>y</math>'' - the perpendicular distance to the neutral axis\n*''<math>I_x</math>'' - the [[second moment of area]] about the neutral axis ''x''.\n\n===Extensions of Euler-Bernoulli beam bending theory===\n\n==== Plastic bending ====\n{{Main|Plastic bending}}\nThe equation <math>\\sigma = \\tfrac{M y}{I_x}</math> is valid only when the stress at the extreme fiber (i.e., the portion of the beam farthest from the neutral axis) is below the [[Yield (engineering)|yield stress]] of the material from which it is constructed. At higher loadings the stress distribution becomes non-linear, and ductile materials will eventually enter a ''plastic hinge'' state where the magnitude of the stress is equal to the yield stress everywhere in the beam, with a discontinuity at the neutral axis where the stress changes from tensile to compressive. This plastic hinge state is typically used as a [[limit states design|limit state]] in the design of steel structures.\n\n====Complex or asymmetrical bending====\nThe equation above is only valid if the cross-section is symmetrical. For homogeneous beams with asymmetrical sections, the maximum bending stress in the beam is given by\n\n: <math>{\\sigma_x}(y,z) = -\\frac {(M_z~I_y + M_y~I_{yz})} {I_y~I_z - I_{yz}^2}y + \\frac {(M_y~I_z + M_z~I_{yz})} {I_y~I_z - I_{yz}^2}z</math><ref>Cook and Young, 1995, Advanced Mechanics of Materials, Macmillan Publishing Company: New York</ref>\n\nwhere <math>y,z</math> are the coordinates of a point on the cross section at which the stress is to be determined as shown to the right, <math>M_y</math> and <math>M_z</math> are the bending moments about the y and z [[centroid]] axes, <math>I_y</math> and <math>I_z</math> are the second moments of area (distinct from moments of inertia) about the y and z axes, and <math>I_{yz}</math> is the [[Product moment of area|product of moments of area]]. Using this equation it is possible to calculate the bending stress at any point on the beam cross section regardless of moment orientation or cross-sectional shape. Note that <math>M_y, M_z, I_y, I_z, I_{yz}</math> do not change from one point to another on the cross section.\n\n====Large bending deformation====\n[[File:Big bending asymptote stress.svg|350px|right]]\nFor large deformations of the body, the stress in the cross-section is calculated using an extended version of this formula. First the following assumptions must be made:\n\n# Assumption of flat sections - before and after deformation the considered section of body remains flat (i.e., is not swirled).\n# Shear and normal stresses in this section that are perpendicular to the normal vector of cross section have no influence on normal stresses that are parallel to this section.\n\nLarge bending considerations should be implemented when the bending radius <math>\\rho</math> is smaller than ten section heights h:\n\n:<math>\\rho < 10 h.</math>\n\nWith those assumptions the stress in large bending is calculated as:\n\n:<math>\n\\sigma = \\frac {F} {A} + \\frac {M} {\\rho A} + {\\frac {M} {{I_x}'}}y{\\frac {\\rho}{\\rho +y}}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>F</math> is the normal [[force]]\n:<math>A</math> is the section [[area]]\n:<math>M</math> is the bending moment\n:<math>\\rho</math> is the local bending radius (the radius of bending at the current section)\n:<math>{{I_x}'}</math> is the area moment of inertia along the [[Cartesian coordinate system|x-axis]], at the <math>y</math> place (see [[Parallel axis theorem|Steiner's theorem]])\n:<math>y</math> is the position along y-axis on the section area in which the stress <math>\\sigma</math> is calculated.\n\nWhen bending radius <math>\\rho</math> approaches infinity and <math>y\\ll\\rho</math>, the original formula is back:\n:<math>\\sigma = {F \\over A} \\pm \\frac {My}{I} </math>.\n\n=== Timoshenko bending theory ===\n{{Main|Timoshenko beam theory}}\n[[File:Plate theory.svg|thumb|200px|Deformation of a Timoshenko beam. The normal rotates by an amount <math>\\theta</math> which is not equal to <math>dw/dx</math>.]]\nIn 1921, [[Stephen Timoshenko|Timoshenko]] improved upon the Euler-Bernoulli theory of beams by adding the effect of shear into the beam equation. The kinematic assumptions of the Timoshenko theory are:\n* normals to the axis of the beam remain straight after deformation\n* there is no change in beam thickness after deformation\nHowever, normals to the axis are not required to remain perpendicular to the axis after deformation.\n\nThe equation for the quasistatic bending of a linear elastic, isotropic, homogeneous beam of constant cross-section beam under these assumptions is<ref name=Thomson/>\n:<math>\n   EI~\\cfrac{\\mathrm{d}^4 w}{\\mathrm{d} x^4} = q(x) - \\cfrac{EI}{k A G}~\\cfrac{\\mathrm{d}^2 q}{\\mathrm{d} x^2}\n</math>\nwhere <math>I</math> is the [[area moment of inertia]] of the cross-section, <math>A</math> is the cross-sectional area, <math>G</math> is the [[shear modulus]],  <math>k</math> is a '''shear correction factor''', and <math>q(x)</math> is an applied transverse load.

Bernoulli's equation of motion of a vibrating beam tended to overestimate the [[natural frequency|natural frequencies]] of beams and was improved marginally by [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Rayleigh]] in 1877 by the addition of a mid-plane rotation. In 1921 [[Stephen Timoshenko]] improved the theory further by incorporating the effect of shear on the dynamic response of bending beams. This allowed the theory to be used for problems involving high frequencies of vibration where the dynamic Euler-Bernoulli theory is inadequate.
