The [[photovoltaic effect]] refers to photons of light exciting electrons into a higher state of energy, allowing them to act as charge carriers for an electric current. The photovoltaic effect was first observed by [[Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel]] in 1839.<ref>[http://www.mrsolar.com/content/photovoltaic_effect.php Photovoltaic Effect]. Mrsolar.com.

Virtually all photovoltaic devices are some type of photodiode.\n\nSolar cells produce direct current electricity from sun light which can be used to power equipment or to [[Rechargeable battery|recharge a battery]]. The first practical application of photovoltaics was to power orbiting satellites and other [[spacecraft]], but today the majority of [[photovoltaic module]]s are used for grid connected power generation. In this case an [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] is required to convert the DC to AC. There is a smaller market for off-grid power for remote dwellings, [[electric boat|boats]], [[recreational vehicle]]s, electric cars, roadside emergency telephones, [[remote sensing]], and [[cathodic protection]] of [[pipeline transport|pipelines]].\n\nPhotovoltaic power generation employs [[solar panel]]s composed of a number of [[solar cell]]s containing a photovoltaic material.

It is well proven, as photovoltaic systems have now been used for fifty years in specialised applications, and grid-connected systems have been in use for over twenty years.\n\nCells require protection from the environment and are usually packaged tightly behind a glass sheet. When more power is required than a single cell can deliver, cells are electrically connected together to form photovoltaic modules, or solar panels. A single module is enough to power an emergency telephone, but for a house or a power plant the modules must be arranged in multiples as [[solar photovoltaic array|arrays]].\n\nPhotovoltaic power capacity is measured as maximum power output under standardized test conditions (STC) in \"W<sub>p</sub>\" ([[Watt-peak|watts peak]]).<ref>{{cite book | title = Handbook of Photovoltaic Science and Engineering |author1=Luque, Antonio  |author2=Hegedus, Steven  |lastauthoramp=yes | url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=u-bCMhl_JjQC|page=326}} | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-471-49196-9}}</ref> The actual power output at a particular point in time may be less than or greater than this standardized, or \"rated,\" value, depending on geographical location, time of day, weather conditions, and other factors.<ref>[http://gisatnrel.nrel.gov/PVWatts_Viewer/index.html The PVWatts Solar Calculator] Retrieved on 7 September 2012</ref> Solar photovoltaic array [[capacity factor]]s are typically under 25%, which is lower than many other industrial sources of electricity.<ref>[http://www.remenergyco.com/why-solar-now Massachusetts: a Good Solar Market].

[[Solar tracker]]s achieve this by moving PV panels to follow the sun. The increase can be by as much as 20% in winter and by as much as 50% in summer. Static mounted systems can be optimized by analysis of the [[sun path]]. Panels are often set to latitude tilt, an angle equal to the latitude, but performance can be improved by adjusting the angle for summer or winter. Generally, as with other semiconductor devices, temperatures above room temperature reduce the performance of photovoltaics.<ref>Vick, B.D., Clark, R.N. (2005).

In such a tower the panels can follow the Sun exactly. Such a device may be described as a [[Turntable ladder#Turntable ladder|ladder]] mounted on a turnable disk. Each step of that ladder is the middle axis of a rectangular [[solar panel]]. In case the zenith distance of the Sun reaches zero, the \"ladder\" may be rotated to the north or the south to avoid a solar panel producing a shadow on a lower solar panel. Instead of an exactly vertical tower one can choose a tower with an axis directed to the [[polar star]], meaning that it is parallel to the rotation axis of the [[Earth]]. In this case the angle between the axis and the Sun is always larger than 66 degrees. During a day it is only necessary to turn the panels around this axis to follow the Sun.

However, the most efficient solar panels are typically the most expensive, and may not be commercially available. Therefore, selection is also driven by cost efficiency and other factors.\n\nThe electrical efficiency of a PV cell is a [[physical property]] which represents how much electrical power a cell can produce for a given [[Solar irradiance|insolation]].

In order to increase the efficiency of solar cells, it is important to choose a semiconductor material with an appropriate [[band gap]] that matches the solar spectrum.

The efficiency of a solar cell declines by about 0.5% for every 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature. This means that a 100 degree increase in surface temperature could decrease the efficiency of a solar cell by about half. Self-cooling solar cells are one solution to this problem. Rather than using energy to cool the surface, pyramid and cone shapes can be formed from [[silica]], and attached to the surface of a solar panel. Doing so allows visible light to reach the [[solar cell]]s, but reflects [[infrared]] rays (which carry heat).<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/18/tech/innovation/solar-cells-of-the-future/ Self-cooling Solar Cells].

Many studies have been done on the various types of PV including [[First generation solar cell|first generation]], second generation, and [[Third Generation Solar Cell|third generation]].

Manufacturing silicon PV systems has several steps. First, polysilicon is processed from mined quartz until it is very pure (semi-conductor grade). This is melted down when small amounts of Boron, a group III element, are added to make a p-type semiconductor rich in electron holes. Typically using a seed crystal, an ingot of this solution is grown from the liquid polycrystalline. The ingot may also be cast in a mold. Wafers of this semiconductor material are cut from the bulk material with wire saws, and then go through surface etching before being cleaned. Next, the wafers are placed into a phosphorus vapor deposition furnace which lays a very thin layer of phosphorus, a group V element, which creates an N-type semiconducting surface. To reduce energy losses an anti-reflective coating is added to the surface, along with electrical contacts. After finishing the cell, cells are connected via electrical circuit according to the specific application and prepared for shipping and installation.<ref>{{cite web|title = How PV Cells Are Made|url = http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/consumer/solar_electricity/basics/how_cells_made.htm|website = www.fsec.ucf.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}</ref>\n\nCrystalline silicon photovoltaics are only one type of PV, and while they represent the majority of solar cells produced currently there are many new and promising technologies that have the potential to be scaled up to meet future energy needs.\n\nAnother newer technology, thin-film PV, are manufactured by depositing semiconducting layers on substrate in vacuum. The substrate is often glass or stainless-steel, and these semiconducting layers are made of many types of materials including cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium diselenide (CIS), copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), and amorphous silicon (a-Si). After being deposited onto the substrate the semiconducting layers are separated and connected by electrical circuit by laser-scribing. Thin-film photovoltaics now make up around 20% of the overall production of PV because of the reduced materials requirements and cost to manufacture modules consisting of thin-films as compared to silicon-based wafers.<ref>{{cite web|title = Thin Film Photovoltaics|url = http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/consumer/solar_electricity/basics/thin-film.htm|website = www.fsec.ucf.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}</ref>\n\nOther emerging PV technologies include organic, dye-sensitized, quantum-dot, and Perovskite photovoltaics. OPVs fall into the thin-film category of manufacturing, and typically operate around the 12% efficiency range which is lower than the 12\u201321% typically seen by silicon based PVs. Because organic photovoltaics require very high purity and are relatively reactive they must be encapsulated which vastly increases cost of manufacturing and meaning that they are not feasible for large scale up. Dye-sensitized PVs are similar in efficiency to OPVs but are significantly easier to manufacture. However these dye-sensitized photovoltaics present storage problems because the liquid electrolyte is toxic and can potentially permeate the plastics used in the cell. Quantum dot solar cells are quantum dot sensitized DSSCs and are solution processed meaning they are potentially scalable, but currently they have not reached greater than 10% efficiency. Perovskite solar cells are a very efficient solar energy converter and have excellent optoelectric properties for photovoltaic purposes, but they are expensive and difficult to manufacture.<ref>Secor, Ethan. \"Emerging Photovoltaic Technologies.\" MSE 381 Lecture.

It consists of an arrangement of several components, including solar panels to absorb and directly convert sunlight into electricity, a solar inverter to change the electric current from DC to AC, as well as mounting, cabling and other electrical accessories. PV systems range from small, [[rooftop photovoltaic power station|roof-top mounted]] or [[building-integrated photovoltaics|building-integrated]] systems with capacities from a few to several tens of [[kilowatts]], to large utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station|power stations]] of hundreds of [[megawatts]]. Nowadays, most PV systems are [[grid-connected photovoltaic power system|grid-connected]], while [[Stand-alone power system|stand-alone]] systems only account for a small portion of the market.\n\n*;Rooftop and building integrated systems\n[[File:SolarFachwerkhaus.jpg|thumb|Rooftop PV on half-timbered house]]\n\n: Photovoltaic arrays are often associated with buildings: either integrated into them, mounted on them or mounted nearby on the ground. [[Rooftop PV system]]s are most often retrofitted into existing buildings, usually mounted on top of the existing roof structure or on the existing walls. Alternatively, an array can be located separately from the building but connected by cable to supply power for the building.

In addition, CPV systems often use [[solar tracker]]s and sometimes a cooling system to further increase their efficiency. Ongoing research and development is rapidly improving their competitiveness in the utility-scale segment and in areas of high solar [[insolation]].\n\n*;Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector\n\n: [[Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector]] (PVT) are systems that convert solar radiation into [[Internal energy|thermal]] and electrical energy. These systems combine a solar PV cell, which converts sunlight into electricity, with a [[solar thermal collector]], which captures the remaining energy and removes waste heat from the PV module. The capture of both electricity and heat allow these devices to have higher [[exergy]] and thus be more overall energy efficient than solar PV or solar thermal alone.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2013.08.026| title = Spectral beam splitting for efficient conversion of solar energy\u2014A review| journal = Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews| volume = 28| pages = 654\u2013663| year = 2013| last1 = Mojiri | first1 = A. | last2 = Taylor | first2 = R. | last3 = Thomsen | first3 = E. | last4 = Rosengarten | first4 = G. }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.01.041| title = Optimizing limited solar roof access by exergy analysis of solar thermal, photovoltaic, and hybrid photovoltaic thermal systems| journal = Applied Energy| volume = 120| pages = 115\u2013124| year = 2014| last1 = Pathak | first1 = M.
