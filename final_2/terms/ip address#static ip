Its role has been characterized as follows: \"A [[hostname|name]] indicates what we seek. An address indicates where it is. A route indicates how to get there.\"<ref name=rfc791>RFC 791, ''Internet Protocol \u2013 DARPA Internet Program Protocol Specification'' (September 1981)</ref>\n\nThe designers of the Internet Protocol defined an IP address as a [[32-bit]] number<ref name=rfc760 /> and this system, known as [[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4), is still in use today. However, because of the growth of the [[Internet]] and the predicted [[IPv4 address exhaustion|depletion of available addresses]], a new version of IP ([[IPv6]]), using 128 bits for the address, was developed in 1995.<ref name=rfc1883>RFC 1883, ''Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification'', S. Deering, R. Hinden (December 1995)</ref> IPv6 was standardized as RFC 2460 in 1998,<ref name =rfc2460>RFC 2460, ''Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification'', S. Deering, R. Hinden, The Internet Society (December 1998)</ref> and its [[IPv6 deployment|deployment]] has been ongoing since the mid-2000s.\n\nIP addresses are usually written and displayed in [[human-readable]] notations, such as 172.16.254.1 (IPv4), and 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1 (IPv6).\n\nThe [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) manages the IP address space allocations globally and delegates five [[regional Internet registries]] (RIRs) to allocate IP address blocks to [[local Internet registry|local Internet registries]] ([[Internet service provider]]s) and other entities.\n\n==IP versions==\nTwo versions of the Internet Protocol (IP) are in use: IP Version 4 and IP Version 6. Each version defines an IP address differently.  Because of its prevalence, the generic term ''IP address'' typically still refers to the addresses defined by [[IPv4]]. The gap in version sequence between IPv4 and IPv6 resulted from the assignment of number 5 to the experimental [[Internet Stream Protocol]] in 1979, which however was never referred to as IPv5.\n\n==IPv4 addresses==\n{{Main|IPv4#Addressing}}\n[[Image:Ipv4 address.svg|right|300px|thumb|Decomposition of an IPv4 address from [[dot-decimal notation]] to its binary value.]]\nIn IPv4 an address consists of 32 [[bit]]s which limits the [[address space]] to {{gaps|4|294|967|296}} (2<sup>32</sup>) possible unique addresses. IPv4 reserves some addresses for special purposes such as [[private network]]s (~18 million addresses) or [[multicast address]]es (~270 million addresses).\n\nIPv4 addresses are canonically represented in [[dot-decimal notation]], which consists of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots, e.g., 172.16.254.1.  Each part represents a group of 8 bits ([[Octet (computing)|octet]]) of the address. In some cases of technical writing, IPv4 addresses may be presented in various [[hexadecimal]], [[octal]], or [[binary numeral system|binary]] representations.\n\n===Subnetting===\nIn the early stages of development of the Internet Protocol,<ref name=rfc760/> network administrators interpreted an IP address in two parts: network number portion and host number portion. The highest order octet (most significant eight bits) in an address was designated as the ''network number'' and the remaining bits were called the ''rest field'' or ''host identifier'' and were used for host numbering within a network.\n\nThis early method soon proved inadequate as additional networks developed that were independent of the existing networks already designated by a network number. In 1981, the Internet addressing specification was revised with the introduction of [[classful network]] architecture.<ref name=rfc791/>\n\nClassful network design allowed for a larger number of individual network assignments and fine-grained [[subnetwork]] design. The first three bits of the most significant octet of an IP address were defined as the ''class'' of the address. Three classes (''A'', ''B'', and ''C'') were defined for universal [[unicast]] addressing. Depending on the class derived, the network identification was based on octet boundary segments of the entire address. Each class used successively additional octets in the network identifier, thus reducing the possible number of hosts in the higher order classes (''B'' and ''C'').\nThe following table gives an overview of this now obsolete system.\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY THIS TABLE BECAUSE YOU THINK IT IS WRONG. It has been checked by knowledgeable editors for correctness within the intended purpose in this article.

The class system of the address space was replaced with [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) in 1993. CIDR is based on variable-length subnet masking (VLSM) to allow allocation and routing based on arbitrary-length prefixes.\n\nToday, remnants of classful network concepts function only in a limited scope as the default configuration parameters of some network software and hardware components (e.g. netmask), and in the technical jargon used in network administrators' discussions.\n\n===Private addresses===\nEarly network design, when global end-to-end connectivity was envisioned for communications with all Internet hosts, intended that IP addresses be uniquely assigned to a particular computer or device. However, it was found that this was not always necessary as [[private network]]s developed and public address space needed to be conserved.\n\nComputers not connected to the Internet, such as factory machines that communicate only with each other via TCP/IP, need not have globally unique IP addresses. Three non-overlapping ranges of IPv4 addresses for private networks were reserved in RFC 1918. These addresses are not routed on the Internet and thus their use need not be coordinated with an IP address registry.\n\nToday, when needed, such private networks typically connect to the Internet through [[network address translation]] (NAT).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ IANA-reserved private IPv4 network ranges\n|-\n!\n!

Typically, a network administrator will divide a block into [[subnetwork|subnets]]; for example, many [[residential gateway|home routers]] automatically use a default address range of 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.0.255 (192.168.0.0/24).\n\n==IPv4 address exhaustion==\n{{Main|IPv4 address exhaustion}}\nHigh levels of demand have decreased the supply of unallocated [[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4) addresses available for assignment to [[Internet service providers]] and end user organizations since the 1980s. This development is referred to as [[IPv4 address exhaustion]]. IANA's primary [[address pool]] was exhausted on 3 February 2011, when the last five blocks were allocated to the five RIRs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nro.net/news/ipv4-free-pool-depleted|title=Free Pool of IPv4 Address Space Depleted|last=Smith|first=Lucie|author2=Lipner, Ian|date=3 February 2011|publisher=[[Regional Internet registry#Number Resource Organization|Number Resource Organization]]|accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2011-February/032105.html |title=Five /8s allocated to RIRs \u2013 no unallocated IPv4 unicast /8s remain | author=ICANN,nanog mailing list}}</ref> [[Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre|APNIC]] was the first RIR to exhaust its regional pool on 15 April 2011, except for a small amount of address space reserved for the transition to IPv6, intended to be allocated in a restricted process.<ref>{{cite web|title=APNIC IPv4 Address Pool Reaches Final /8|url=http://www.apnic.net/publications/news/2011/final-8|accessdate=15 April 2011|author=Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre|date=15 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n==IPv6 addresses==\n{{Main|IPv6 address}}\n[[Image:Ipv6 address.svg|right|300px|thumb|Decomposition of an IPv6 address from [[hexadecimal]] representation to its binary value.]]\nThe rapid exhaustion of IPv4 address space prompted the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) to explore new technologies to expand the addressing capability in the Internet. The permanent solution was deemed to be a redesign of the Internet Protocol itself. This new generation of the Internet Protocol was eventually named ''[[IPv6|Internet Protocol Version 6]]'' (IPv6) in 1995.<ref name=rfc1883/><ref name=rfc2460/> The address size was increased from 32 to 128 [[bit]]s (16 [[Octet (computing)|octet]]s), thus providing up to 2<sup>128</sup> (approximately {{val|3.403|e=38}}) addresses. This is deemed sufficient for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe intent of the new design was not to provide just a sufficient quantity of addresses, but also redesign routing in the Internet by more efficient aggregation of subnetwork routing prefixes. This resulted in slower growth of routing tables in routers. The smallest possible individual allocation is a subnet for 2<sup>64</sup> hosts, which is the square of the size of the entire IPv4 Internet. At these levels, actual address utilization rates will be small on any IPv6 network segment. The new design also provides the opportunity to separate the addressing infrastructure of a network segment, i.e. the local administration of the segment's available space, from the addressing prefix used to route traffic to and from external networks. IPv6 has facilities that automatically change the routing prefix of entire networks, should the global connectivity or the routing policy change, without requiring internal redesign or manual renumbering.\n\nThe large number of IPv6 addresses allows large blocks to be assigned for specific purposes and, where appropriate, to be aggregated for efficient routing. With a large address space, there is no need to have complex address conservation methods as used in CIDR.\n\nAll modern desktop and enterprise server operating systems include native support for the IPv6 protocol, but it is not yet widely deployed in other devices, such as residential networking routers, [[voice over IP]] (VoIP) and multimedia equipment, and network peripherals.\n\n===Private addresses===\nJust as IPv4 reserves addresses for private networks, blocks of addresses are set aside in IPv6. In IPv6, these are referred to as [[unique local address]]es (ULA). RFC 4193 reserves the routing prefix fc00::/7 for this block which is divided into two /8 blocks with different implied policies. The addresses include a 40-bit pseudorandom number that minimizes the risk of address collisions if sites merge or packets are misrouted.<ref>RFC 4193 section 3.2.1</ref>\n\nEarly practices used a different block for this purpose (fec0::), dubbed site-local addresses.<ref>RFC 3513</ref> However, the definition of what constituted ''sites'' remained unclear and the poorly defined addressing policy created ambiguities for routing. This address type was abandoned and must not be used in new systems.<ref>RFC 3879</ref>\n\nAddresses starting with fe80:, called [[Link-local address|link-local]] addresses, are assigned to interfaces for communication on the attached link. The addresses are automatically generated by the operating system for each network interface. This provides instant and automatic communication between all IPv6 host on a link. This feature is required in the lower layers of IPv6 network administration, such as for the [[Neighbor Discovery Protocol]].\n\nPrivate address prefixes may not be routed on the public Internet.\n\n==IP subnetworks==\nIP networks may be divided into [[subnetwork]]s in both [[IPv4 subnetting reference|IPv4]] and [[IPv6 subnetting reference|IPv6]]. For this purpose, an IP address is logically recognized as consisting of two parts: the ''network prefix'' and the ''host identifier'', or ''interface identifier'' (IPv6). The [[subnetwork#Binary subnet masks|subnet mask]] or the CIDR prefix determines how the IP address is divided into network and host parts.\n\nThe term ''subnet mask'' is only used within IPv4. Both IP versions however use the CIDR concept and notation. In this, the IP address is followed by a slash and the number (in decimal) of bits used for the network part, also called the ''routing prefix''. For example, an IPv4 address and its subnet mask may be 192.0.2.1 and 255.255.255.0, respectively. The [[CIDR notation]] for the same IP address and subnet is 192.0.2.1/24, because the first 24 bits of the IP address indicate the network and subnet.\n\n== IP address assignment {{anchor|Dynamic IP|Static IP}} == <!-- redirect target from [[Dynamic IP]] and [[Static IP]] -->\nInternet Protocol addresses are assigned to a host either anew at the time of booting, or permanently by fixed configuration of its hardware or software. Persistent configuration is also known as using a ''static IP address''. In contrast, in situations when the computer's IP address is assigned newly each time, this is known as using a ''dynamic IP address''.\n\n===Methods===\nStatic IP addresses are manually assigned to a computer by an administrator.  The exact procedure varies according to platform. This contrasts with dynamic IP addresses, which are assigned either by the computer interface or host software itself, as in [[Zeroconf]], or assigned by a server using [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] (DHCP). Even though IP addresses assigned using DHCP may stay the same for long periods of time, they can generally change.  In some cases, a network administrator may implement dynamically assigned static IP addresses.  In this case, a DHCP server is used, but it is specifically configured to always assign the same IP address to a particular computer.  This allows static IP addresses to be configured centrally, without having to specifically configure each computer on the network in a manual procedure.\n\nIn the absence or failure of static or stateful (DHCP) address configurations, an operating system may assign an IP address to a network interface using state-less auto-configuration methods, such as [[Zeroconf]].\n\n===Uses of dynamic address assignment===\nIP addresses are most frequently assigned dynamically on LANs and broadband networks by the [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] (DHCP). They are used because it avoids the administrative burden of assigning specific static addresses to each device on a network.  It also allows many devices to share limited address space on a network if only some of them will be online at a particular time.  In most current desktop operating systems, dynamic IP configuration is enabled by default so that a user does not need to manually enter any settings to connect to a network with a DHCP server.  DHCP is not the only technology used to assign IP addresses dynamically. Dialup and some broadband networks use dynamic address features of the [[Point-to-Point Protocol]].\n\n==== Sticky dynamic IP address {{anchor|Sticky dynamic IP address}} ==== \n<!-- redirect target from [[Sticky dynamic IP address]] and [[Sticky IP]] -->\nA ''sticky dynamic IP address'' is an informal term used by cable and DSL Internet access subscribers to describe a dynamically assigned IP address which seldom changes. The addresses are usually assigned with DHCP. Since the modems are usually powered on for extended periods of time, the address leases are usually set to long periods and simply renewed. If a modem is turned off and powered up again before the next expiration of the address lease, it will most likely receive the same IP address.\n\n===Address autoconfiguration===\nRFC 3330 defines an address block, 169.254.0.0/16, for the special use in [[link-local address]]ing for IPv4 networks. In [[IPv6]], every interface, whether using static or dynamic address assignments, also receives a local-link address automatically in the block fe80::/10.\n\nThese addresses are only valid on the link, such as a local network segment or point-to-point connection, that a host is connected to. These addresses are not routable and like private addresses cannot be the source or destination of packets traversing the Internet.\n\nWhen the link-local IPv4 address block was reserved, no standards existed for mechanisms of address autoconfiguration. Filling the void, [[Microsoft]] created an implementation that is called Automatic Private IP Addressing ([[APIPA]]). APIPA has been deployed on millions of machines and has, thus, become a [[de facto standard]] in the industry. In RFC 3927, the [[IETF]] defined a formal standard for this functionality, entitled ''Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses''.\n\n===Uses of static addressing===\nSome infrastructure situations have to use static addressing, such as when finding the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) host that will translate [[domain names]] to IP addresses. Static addresses are also convenient, but not absolutely necessary, to locate servers inside an enterprise. An address obtained from a DNS server comes with a [[time to live]], or [[Domain Name System#Caching time|caching time]], after which it should be looked up to confirm that it has not changed. Even static IP addresses do change as a result of network administration (RFC 2072).\n\n===Conflict===\nAn IP address conflict occurs when two devices on the same local physical or wireless network claim to have the same IP address \u2013 that is, they conflict with each other.  Since only one of the devices is supposed to be on the network at a time, the second one to arrive will generally stop the IP functionality of one or both of the devices.  In many cases with modern [[Operating System]]s, the Operating System will notify the user of one of the devices that there is an IP address conflict (displaying the symptom error message<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd379838(v=ws.10).aspx\n| title = Event ID 4198 \u2014 TCP/IP Network Interface Configuration\n| author = | authorlink=\n| accessdate = 2 June 2013 | date =7 January 2009 | publisher = [[:en:Microsoft|Microsoft]]\n| archiveurl  = \n| archivedate = \n}} \"Updated: January 7, 2009\"</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd379922(v=ws.10).aspx\n| title = Event ID 4199 \u2014 TCP/IP Network Interface Configuration\n| author = | authorlink=\n| accessdate = 2 June 2013 | date =7 January 2009 | publisher = [[:en:Microsoft|Microsoft]]\n| archiveurl  = \n| archivedate = \n}} \"Updated: 7 January 2009\"</ref>) and then either stop functioning on the network or function very poorly on the network.

It normally refers to a single sender or a single receiver, and can be used for both sending and receiving. Usually, a unicast address is associated with a single device or host, but a device or host may have more than one unicast address. Some individual PCs have several distinct unicast addresses, each for its own distinct purpose. Sending the same data to multiple unicast addresses requires the sender to send all the data many times over, once for each recipient.\n\n===Broadcast addressing===\n{{Main|Broadcast|l1=Broadcasting (computing)}}\nIn IPv4 it is possible to send data to all possible destinations (\"all-hosts broadcast\"), which permits the sender to send the data only once, and all receivers receive a copy of it. In the IPv4 protocol, the address 255.255.255.255 is used for local broadcast. In addition, a directed (limited) broadcast can be made by combining the network prefix with a host suffix composed entirely of binary 1s. For example, the destination address used for a directed broadcast to devices on the 192.0.2.0/24 network is 192.0.2.255. IPv6 does not implement broadcast addressing and replaces it with multicast to the specially-defined all-nodes multicast address.\n\n===Multicast addressing===\nA [[multicast address]] is associated with a group of interested receivers. In IPv4, addresses 224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255 (the former [[Classful network|Class D]] addresses) are designated as multicast addresses.<ref name=\"RFC 5771\">RFC 5771</ref> IPv6 uses the address block with the prefix ff00::/8 for multicast applications. In either case, the sender sends a single datagram from its unicast address to the multicast group address and the intermediary routers take care of making copies and sending them to all receivers that have joined the corresponding multicast group.\n\n===Anycast addressing===\nLike broadcast and multicast, [[anycast]] is a one-to-many routing topology. However, the data stream is not transmitted to all receivers, just the one which the router decides is logically closest in the network. Anycast address is an inherent feature of only IPv6.  In IPv4, anycast addressing implementations typically operate using the shortest-path metric of [[Border Gateway Protocol|BGP routing]] and do not take into account congestion or other attributes of the path. Anycast methods are useful for global load balancing and are commonly used in distributed [[Domain name system|DNS]] systems.\n\n=={{visible anchor|Public address}}==\nA public IP address, in common parlance, is a globally routable unicast IP address, meaning that the address is not an address reserved for use in [[private network]]s, such as those reserved by RFC 1918, or the various IPv6 address formats of local scope or site-local scope, for example for [[link-local address]]ing. Public IP addresses may be used for communication between hosts on the global Internet.\n\n==Modifications to IP addressing==\n===IP blocking and firewalls===\n[[Firewall (computer)|Firewall]]s perform [[IP blocking|Internet Protocol blocking]] to protect networks from unauthorized access. They are common on {{As of|2008|alt= today}}'s Internet. They control access to networks based on the IP address of a client computer. Whether using a [[blacklist (computing)|blacklist]] or a [[whitelist]], the IP address that is blocked is the perceived IP address of the client, meaning that if the client is using a [[proxy server]] or [[network address translation]], blocking one IP address may block many individual computers.\n\n===IP address translation===\nMultiple client devices can appear to share IP addresses: either because they are part of a [[shared hosting]] [[web server]] environment or because an IPv4 [[network address translator]] (NAT) or [[proxy server]] acts as an [[intermediary]] agent on behalf of its customers, in which case the real originating IP addresses might be hidden from the server receiving a request. A common practice is to have a NAT hide a large number of IP addresses in a [[private network]]. Only the \"outside\" interface(s) of the NAT need to have Internet-routable addresses.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n| last=Comer\n| first=Douglas\n| title=Internetworking with TCP/IP:Principles, Protocols, and Architectures \u2013 4th ed.\n| publisher=Prentice Hall\n| year=2000\n| location=Upper Saddle River, NJ\n| url=http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dec/netbooks.html\n| isbn=0-13-018380-6\n| page=394}}</ref>\n\nMost commonly, the NAT device maps TCP or UDP port numbers on the side of the larger, public network to individual private addresses on the masqueraded network.\n\nIn small home networks, NAT functions are usually implemented in a [[residential gateway]] device, typically one marketed as a \"router\". In this scenario, the computers connected to the router would have private IP addresses and the router would have a public address to communicate on the Internet. This type of router allows several computers to share one public IP address.\n\n==Diagnostic tools==\nComputer operating systems provide various diagnostic tools to examine their network interface and address configuration. [[MS Windows|Windows]] provides the [[command-line interface]] tools [[ipconfig]] and [[netsh]] and users of [[Unix-like]] systems can use [[ifconfig]], [[netstat]], [[route (command)|route]], [[lanstat]], [[fstat (Unix)|fstat]], or [[iproute2]] utilities to accomplish the task.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[IP address location]]\n* [[Hierarchical name space]]\n* [[Hostname]]: a human-readable alpha-numeric designation that may map to an IP address\n* [[IP address spoofing]]\n* [[IP aliasing]]\n* [[IP blocking]]\n* [[IP Multicast]]\n* [[IPv4 subnetting reference]]\n* [[IPv6 subnetting reference]]\n* [[List of assigned /8 IPv4 address blocks]]\n* [[MAC address]]\n* [[Ping (networking utility)]]\n* [[Private network]]\n* [[Regional Internet Registry]]\n* [[Subnet address]]\n* [[Virtual IP address]]\n* [[WHOIS]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n<!--\nBefore you add a new external link here, please make sure it complies with [[WP:EL]].
