Many different combinations of engine location and driven wheels are found in practice, and the location of each is dependent on the application for which the vehicle will be used. Factors influencing the design choice include cost, complexity, reliability, packaging (location and size of the passenger compartment and [[Trunk (automobile)|boot]]), [[weight distribution]], and the vehicle's intended [[car handling|handling characteristics]].\n\nLayouts can roughly be divided into two categories: front- or rear-wheel drive. Four-wheel-drive vehicles may take on the characteristics of either, depending on how power is distributed to the wheels.\n\n{{anchor|Front wheel drive layouts}}\n\n==Front-wheel-drive layouts==\n{{main|front-wheel drive}}\n[[File:Automotive diagrams 10 En.png|thumb|275px|FF layout]]\nFront-wheel-drive layouts are those in which the front wheels of the vehicle are driven. The most popular layout used in cars today is the front-engine, front-wheel drive, with the engine in front of the front axle, driving the front wheels. This layout is typically chosen for its compact packaging; since the engine and driven wheels are on the same side of the vehicle, there is no need for a central tunnel through the passenger compartment to accommodate a [[prop-shaft]] between the engine and the driven wheels.\n\nAs the steered wheels are also the driven wheels, FF (front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout) cars are generally considered superior to FR (front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout) cars in conditions such as snow, mud, or wet tarmac. The weight of the engine over the driven wheels also improves grip in such conditions. However, powerful cars rarely use the FF layout because weight transference under acceleration reduces the weight on the front wheels and reduces their [[Traction (engineering)|traction]], limiting the torque which can be utilized. Electronic [[Traction control system|traction control]] can avoid wheelspin but largely negates the benefit of extra torque/power.\n\nA [[transverse engine]] (also known as \"east-west\") is commonly used in FF designs, in contrast to FR which uses a [[longitudinal engine]]. The FF layout also restricts the size of the engine that can be placed in modern engine compartments, as FF configurations usually have [[Inline-4]] and [[V6]] engines, while longer engines such as [[Inline-6]] and [[V8 engine#V angles|90\u00b0 V8]] will rarely fit. This is another reason luxury/sports cars avoid the FF layout. Exceptions do exist, such as the [[Volvo S80]] (FWD/4WD) which uses transversely mounted inline 6 and [[V8 engine|V8]] engines, and the [[Ford Taurus SHO]], available with a 60\u00b0 V8 and front-wheel drive.\n\n===Characteristics===\nFront-wheel drive gives more interior space since the [[powertrain]] is a single unit contained in the engine compartment of the vehicle and there is no need to devote interior space for a [[driveshaft]] tunnel or rear [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]], increasing the volume available for passengers and cargo.<ref name=\"insideline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.edmunds.com/car-technology/what-wheel-drive.html |title=What Wheel Drive? |work=Edmunds Inside Line |first=Karl |last=Brauer |date=2009-05-12|accessdate=2012-12-09}}</ref> There are some exceptions to this as [[rear engine]] designs do not take away interior space (see [[Porsche 911]], and [[Volkswagen Beetle]]).

In this instance, both power and steering are directed through the front wheels, the rears remaining free. Following the principle of weight transfer once more, the lightening of the front wheels under acceleration considerably reduces their effectiveness and thus limits the usable power.

During heavy acceleration, weight is shifted to the back, improving [[traction (engineering)|traction]] at the rear wheels at the expense of the front driving wheels; consequently, most racing cars are rear-wheel drive for acceleration. However, since front-wheel-drive cars have the weight of the engine over the driving wheels, the problem only applies in extreme conditions in which case the car understeers. On snow, ice, and sand, rear-wheel drive loses its traction advantage to front or all-wheel-drive vehicles which have greater weight over the driven wheels.  Rear-wheel-drive cars with [[rear engine]] or [[mid engine]] configuration retain traction over the driven wheels, although fishtailing remains an issue on hard acceleration while in a turn. Some rear engine cars (e.g., [[Porsche 911]]) can suffer from reduced steering ability under heavy acceleration, since the engine is outside the wheelbase and at the opposite end of the car from the wheels doing the steering. A rear-wheel-drive car's centre of gravity is shifted rearward when heavily loaded with passengers or cargo, which may cause unpredictable handling behavior.<ref name=\"hidden\"/>\n\nOn FR cars, the long driveshaft adds to drivetrain elasticity.<ref name=\"hidden\"/>\n\n===Advantages===\n* Interior space: Since the [[powertrain]] is a single unit contained in the engine compartment of the vehicle, there is no need to devote interior space for a [[driveshaft]] tunnel or rear [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]], increasing the volume available for passengers and cargo.<ref name=\"insideline\" />\n** Instead, the tunnel may be used to route the exhaust system pipes.\n* Weight: Fewer components usually means lower weight.\n* Improved [[fuel efficiency]] due to less weight.<ref>{{cite web | last = Kenwright | first = Joe | date = 2010-04-15 | url = http://www.carpoint.com.au/advice/2010/driving-wheels--front-rear-or-allwheel-drive-7382 | title = Driving Wheels - Front, Rear or All-Wheel Drive? | work = CarPoint | accessdate = 2010-05-06}}</ref>\n* Cost: Fewer material components and less installation complexity overall. However, the considerable [[Suggested retail price|MSRP]] differential between a FF and FR car cannot be attributed to layout alone. The difference is more probably explained by [[economy of scale|production volumes]] as most rear-wheel cars are usually in the sports/performance/luxury categories (which tend to be more upscale and/or have more powerful engines), while the FF configuration is typically in mass-produced mainstream cars. Few modern \"family\" cars have rear-wheel drive as of 2009, so a direct cost comparison is not necessarily possible. A contrast could be somewhat drawn between the [[Audi A4]] FrontTrak (which has an FF layout and front-wheel drive) and a rear-wheel-drive [[BMW 3-Series]] (which is FR), both which are in the [[compact executive car]] classification and use longitudinally mounted engines.<ref name=\"insideline\" />\n* Improved drivetrain efficiency: the direct connection between engine and transaxle reduce the mass and mechanical [[inertia]] of the drivetrain compared to a rear-wheel-drive vehicle with a similar engine and transmission, allowing greater [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]].<ref name=\"insideline\" />\n* Assembly efficiency: the powertrain can often be assembled and installed as a unit, which allows more efficient production.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n* Placing the mass of the drivetrain over the driven wheels moves the [[centre of gravity]] farther forward than a comparable rear-wheel-drive layout, improving [[traction (engineering)|traction]] and directional stability on wet, snowy, or icy surfaces.<ref name=\"insideline\" /><ref name=\"Milliken\"/><ref name=\"daytona\" />\n* Predictable handling characteristics: front-wheel-drive cars, with a front weight bias, tend to [[understeer]] at the limit, which (according to SAAB engineer Gunnar Larsson) is easier since it makes instinct correct in avoiding terminal [[oversteer]], and less prone to result in [[fishtailing]] or a spin.<ref name=\"daytona\" /><ref name=\"hidden\"/>\n* A skilled driver can control the movement of the car even while skidding by steering, throttling and pulling the hand brake (given that the hand brake operates the rear wheels as in most cases, with some [[Citroen]] and [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] models being notable exceptions).\n* It is easier to correct [[Lift-off oversteer|trailing-throttle or trailing-brake oversteer]].<ref name=\"daytona\" />\n* The wheelbase can be extended without building a longer driveshaft (as with rear-wheel-driven cars).\n\n===Disadvantages===\n* Front-engine front-wheel-drive layouts are \"nose heavy\" with more weight distribution forward, which makes them prone to [[understeer]], especially in high horsepower applications. \n** If a front-engine front-wheel-drive layout is fitted with a [[four-wheel-drive]], plus enthusiast driver aids, such as active front differential, active steering, and ultra-quick electrically adjustable shocks, this somewhat negate the understeer problem and allow the car to perform as well as a front-engine rear-wheel-drive car.

It is a result of the offset between the point about which the wheel steers (it is aligned with the points where the wheel is connected to the steering mechanisms) and the centroid of its [[contact patch]]. The tractive force acts through the centroid of the contact patch, and the offset of the steering point means that a turning moment about the axis of steering is generated. In an ideal situation, the left and right wheels would generate equal and opposite moments, canceling each other out; however, in reality, this is less likely to happen. Torque steer can be addressed by using a longitudinal layout, equal length drive shafts, half shafts, a multilink suspension or centre-point steering geometry.<ref name=autogenerated7>{{cite web |url=http://www.mscsoftware.com/support/library/conf/adams/euro/2002/papers/005_EUC_008_FORD.pdf |format=PDF|title=Torque Steer Influences on McPherson Front Axles |author=Jens Dornhege}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated8>{{cite web |url=http://www.autozine.org/technical_school/handling/tech_handling_6.htm |title=Handling |publisher=AutoZine Technical School}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated10>{{cite web |url=http://www.se-r.net/about/g20/scc/oct98/tb.html |title=Technobabble: Multilink and the Beam | publisher=Sport Compact Car&nbsp;\u2014 November '98}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web |url=http://www.autozine.org/technical_school/suspension/tech_suspension21.htm |title=Suspension Geometry |publisher=AutoZine Technical School}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|url=http://www.quaife.co.uk/Why-use-Quaife |title=Why use Quaife? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906190059/http://www.quaife.co.uk/Why-use-Quaife |archive-date=2009-09-06}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web |url=http://www.robietherobot.com/storm/geo_storm_mods_transmission.htm |title=Storm Transmission Modifications}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated6>{{cite web |url=http://www-cdr.stanford.edu/dynamic/bywire/acc2004_r1.pdf |format=PDF|title=Vehicle State Estimation Using Steering Torque |author=Paul Yih |publisher=Stanford University}}</ref>\n* In a vehicle, the weight shifts back during acceleration, giving more traction to the rear wheels. This is one of the main reasons nearly all racing cars are rear-wheel drive. However, since front-wheel-drive cars have the weight of the engine over the driving wheels, the problem only applies in extreme conditions such as attempting to accelerate up a wet hill or attempting to beat another RWD car off the line.\n* In some towing situations, front-wheel-drive cars can be at a traction disadvantage since there will be less weight on the driving wheels. Because of this, the weight that the vehicle is rated to safely tow is likely to be less than that of a rear-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive vehicle of the same size and power.\n* Due to geometry and packaging constraints, the CV joints ([[constant-velocity joint]]s) attached to the wheel hub have a tendency to wear out much earlier than the [[universal joint]]s typically used in their rear-wheel-drive counterparts (although rear-wheel-drive vehicles with [[independent rear suspension]] also employ CV joints and half-shafts). The significantly shorter drive axles on a front-wheel-drive car causes the joint to flex through a much wider degree of motion, compounded by additional stress and angles of steering, while the CV joints of a rear-wheel-drive car regularly see angles and wear of less than half that of front-wheel-drive vehicles.\n* Turning circle&nbsp;\u2014 FF layouts almost always use a [[Transverse engine]] (\"east-west\") installation, which limits the amount by which the front wheels can turn, thus increasing the turning circle of a front-wheel-drive car compared to a rear-wheel-drive one with the same wheelbase. A notable example is the original [[Mini]]. It is widely misconceived that this limitation is due to a limit on the angle at which a [[CV joint]] can be operated, but this is easily disproved by considering the turning circle of car models that use a ''longitudinal'' FF or F4 layout from [[Audi]] and (prior to 1992) [[Saab Automobile|Saab]]\n* The FF [[transverse engine]] layout (also known as \"east-west\") restricts the size of the engine that can be placed in modern engine compartments, so it is rarely adopted by powerful luxury and sports cars. FF configurations can usually only accommodate [[Inline-4]] and [[V6]] engines, while longer engines such as [[Inline-6]] and 90\u00b0 big-bore [[V8 engine|V8]] will rarely fit, though there are exceptions. One way around this problem is using a [[VR6 engine|staggered engine]].\n* It makes heavier use of the front tyres (i.e., accelerating, braking, and turning), causing more wear in the front than in a rear-wheel-drive layout.\n* Under extreme braking (like for instance in a panic stop), the already front heavy layout further reduces traction to the rear wheels. This results in disproportionate gripping forces focused at the front while the rear does not have enough weight to effectively use its brakes. Because the rear tyres' capabilities in braking are not very high, a significant number of cheaper front drive vehicles use drum brakes in the rear even today.\n* The steering 'feel' is more numbed than a RWD car. This is due to the extra weight of drive shafts and CV joint components that increase [[unsprung weight]].\n\n{{anchor|Rear wheel drive layouts}}\n\n==Rear-wheel-drive layouts==\n[[File:Automotive diagrams 01 En.png|thumb|275px|FR layout]]\n[[File:Automotive diagrams 05 En.png|thumb|275px|RR layout]]\n\nRear-wheel drive (RWD) typically places the engine in the front of the vehicle and the driven wheels are located at the rear, a configuration known as [[front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout]] (FR layout). The [[FMR layout|front mid-engine]], [[RMR layout|rear mid-engine]] and [[RR layout|rear engine]] layouts are also used.  This was the traditional automobile layout for most vehicles up until the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sae.org/technical/papers/2006-01-1339|title=Development of a New Hybrid Transmission for RWD Car|publisher=www.sae.org|accessdate=2008-01-11|last=|first=}}</ref> Nearly all [[motorcycle]]s and [[bicycle]]s use rear-wheel drive as well, either by [[driveshaft]], [[Chain drive|chain]], or [[Belt (mechanical)|belt]], since the front wheel is turned for steering, and it would be very difficult and cumbersome to \"bend\" the drive mechanism around the turn of the front wheel. A relatively rare exception is with the 'moving bottom bracket' type of recumbent bicycle, where the entire drivetrain, including pedals and chain, pivot with the steering front wheel.\n\n===Characteristics===\nThe vast majority of rear-wheel-drive vehicles use a [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinally mounted engine]] in the front of the vehicle, driving the rear wheels via a [[driveshaft]] linked via a [[differential (mechanics)|differential]] between the rear axles.  Some FR layout vehicles place the gearbox at the rear, though most attach it to the engine at the front.\n\nThe FR layout is often chosen for its simple design and good handling characteristics. Placing the drive wheels at the rear allows ample room for the transmission in the centre of the vehicle and avoids the mechanical complexities associated with transmitting power to the front wheels. For performance-oriented vehicles, the FR layout is more suitable than front-wheel-drive designs, especially with engines that exceed 200 [[horsepower]].  This is because weight transfers to the rear of the vehicle during acceleration, which loads the rear wheels and increases their grip.\n\nAnother advantage of the FR layout is relatively easy access to the engine compartment, a result of the [[longitudinal engine|longitudinal orientation of the drivetrain]], as compared to the FF layout ([[Front-engine, front-wheel drive layout|front-engine, front-wheel drive]]). Powerful engines such as the [[Inline-6]] and 90\u00b0 big-bore [[V8 engine|V8]] are usually too long to fit in a FF [[transverse engine]] (\"east-west\") layout; the FF configuration can typically accommodate at the maximum an [[Inline-4]] or [[V6]]. This is another reason luxury/sports cars almost never use the FF layout.\n\n===Advantages===\n* Even weight distribution \u2014 The layout of a rear-wheel-drive car is much closer to an even fore-and-aft weight distribution than a front-wheel-drive car, as more of the engine can lie between the front and rear wheels (in the case of a [[mid engine]] layout, the entire engine), and the transmission is moved much farther back.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiandriver.com/winter/020619.htm |title=Front wheel drive vs rear wheel drive |author=Jim Kerr |publisher=Canadian Driver |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612190222/http://www.canadiandriver.com/winter/020619.htm |archive-date=2008-06-12}}</ref>\n* [[Weight transfer]] during acceleration&nbsp;\u2014 During heavy acceleration, weight is placed on the rear, or driving wheels, which improves [[traction (engineering)|traction]].\n* No [[Torque steering|torque steer]]<ref name=\"forza\">{{cite web |url=http://forzamotorsport.net/121306-1.htm |title=FWD vs. RWD |publisher=Forza Motorsport 2 |author=Che Chou}}</ref><!-- Not a [[WP:RS]] <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1174269 |title=Torque Steer}}</ref>--> (unless it's an all-wheel steer with an offset differential).\n* Steering radius&nbsp;\u2014 As no complicated drive shaft joints are required at the front wheels, it is possible to turn them further than would be possible using front-wheel drive, resulting in a smaller steering radius for a given wheelbase.\n* Better [[Car handling|handling]] at the hands of an expert&nbsp;\u2014 the more even weight distribution and weight transfer improve the handling of the car.

These engines are usually too long to fit in a FF [[transverse engine]] (\"east-west\") layout; the FF configuration can typically accommodate at the maximum an [[inline-four engine|Inline-4]] or [[V6 engine|V6]].\n* Road grip feedback&nbsp;\u2014 front wheels are not affected by engine and gearbox, thus allowing for better feeling of tyre grip on road surface.\n\n===Disadvantages===\n* Under heavy acceleration (as in racing), [[oversteer]] and [[fishtailing]] may occur as the rear wheels break free and spin. The corrective action is to let off the throttle (this is what traction control automatically does for RWD vehicles).\n* On snow, ice and sand, rear-wheel drive loses its traction advantage to front- or all-wheel-drive vehicles, which have greater weight on the driven wheels. This issue is particularly noticeable on pickup trucks, as the weight of the engine and cab will significantly shift the weight from the rear to the front wheels. Rear-wheel-drive cars with [[rear engine]] or [[mid engine]] configuration do not suffer from this, although [[fishtailing]] remains an issue. To correct this situation, owners of RWD vehicles can load sandbags in the back of the vehicle (either in the bed, or boot) in order to increase the weight over the rear axle, however speeds should be restricted to correctly predicted available grip of the road.\n* Some rear engine cars (e.g., [[Porsche 911]]) can suffer from reduced steering ability under heavy acceleration, because the engine is outside the wheelbase and at the opposite end of the car from the wheels doing the steering although the engine weight over the rear wheels provides outstanding traction and grip during acceleration.\n* Decreased interior space&nbsp;\u2014 Though individual designs vary greatly, rear-wheel-drive vehicles may have: Less front leg room as the transmission tunnel takes up a space between the driver and front passenger, less leg room for centre rear passengers (due to the tunnel needed for the drive shaft), and sometimes less [[Trunk (automobile)|boot]] space (since there is also more hardware that must be placed underneath the boot).  [[Rear engine]] designs (such as the [[Porsche 911]] and [[Volkswagen Beetle]]) do not inherently take away interior space.\n** A rear-wheel drive vehicle with four-wheel drive, compared to a front-wheel drive vehicle with four-wheel drive, will have a less efficient interior packaging since the transmission is often under the front passenger compartment between the two seats, whereas the latter can package all the components under the hood.<ref name=\"thetruthaboutcars.com\"/>\n* Increased weight&nbsp;\u2014 The components of a rear-wheel-drive vehicle's power train are less complex, but they are larger. The driveshaft adds weight. There is extra sheet metal to form the transmission tunnel.  There is a rear [[axle]] or rear half-shafts, which are typically longer than those in a front-wheel-drive car.  A rear-wheel-drive car will weigh slightly more than a comparable front-wheel-drive car (but less than four-wheel drive).\n* Rear biased weight distribution when loaded&nbsp;\u2014 A rear-wheel-drive car's centre of gravity is shifted rearward when heavily loaded with passengers or cargo, which may cause unpredictable handling behavior at the hands of an inexperienced driver.<ref name=\"hidden\">{{cite web |url=http://www.saabnet.com/tsn/models/1984/pr2.html |title=The Hidden Virtues of Front Wheel Drive |publisher=Saab Automobile}}</ref> It needs to be noted that rear engine cars are by their very nature, rear weight biased.\n* Higher initial purchase price&nbsp;\u2014 Modern rear-wheel-drive vehicles are typically more expensive to purchase than comparable front-wheel-drive vehicles. Part of this can be explained by the added cost of materials and increased labor put in to assembly of FR layouts, as the [[powertrain]] is not one compact unit. However, the difference is more probably explained by [[economy of scale|production volumes]] as most rear-wheel cars are usually in the sports/performance/luxury categories (which tend to be more upscale and/or have more powerful engines), while the FF configuration is typically in mass-produced mainstream cars.\n* The possibility of a slight loss in the mechanical efficiency of the drivetrain (approximately 17% coastdown losses between engine flywheel and road wheels compared to 15% for front-wheel drive&nbsp;\u2014 however these losses are highly dependent on the individual transmission).{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  Cars with [[rear engine]] or [[mid engine]] configuration and a transverse engine layout do not suffer from this.\n* The long [[driveshaft]] (on front engine cars) adds to drivetrain elasticity.<ref name=\"hidden\"/> The driveshaft must also be extended for cars with a stretched wheelbase (e.g. limousines, minivans).\n\n{{anchor|Four wheel drive layouts}}\n\n==Four-wheel-drive layouts==\n[[File:Automotive diagrams 02 En.png|thumb|275px|Front-engine, rear-wheel drive derived \u201cF4\u201d layout]]\n''Note: in North America, Australia and New Zealand the term \"four-wheel drive\" usually refers only to drivetrains which are primarily two-wheel drive with a part-time four-wheel-drive capability, as typically found in [[pickup truck]]s and other off-road vehicles, while the term \"all-wheel drive\" is used to refer to full time four-wheel-drive systems found in performance cars and smaller car-based SUVs.

They fall into two major categories:\n\n* [[Front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout|Front-engine, rear-wheel drive]] derived 4WD systems, standard in most [[sport utility vehicle]]s and in passenger cars, (usually referred to \u201cfront engine, rear-wheel drive/four-wheel drive\u201d), forerunners of today's models include the [[Jensen FF]], [[AMC Eagle]] and [[Mercedes-Benz W124]] with the [[4Matic]] system and [[Suzuki Grand Vitara]] with/without 4 mode transfer case.\n* [[Transverse engine|Transverse]] and [[longitudinal engine]] 4WD systems derived almost exclusively from [[Front-wheel drive|front-engine, front-drive layouts]], fitted to luxury, sporting and heavy duty segments, for example the transverse-engine [[Mitsubishi GTO|Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4]] and [[Toyota RAV4]] and the longitudinal-engine [[Audi Quattro]] and most of the [[Subaru]] line.\n\nFor a full explanation of 4WD engineering considerations, see the main article on [[four-wheel drive]]\n\n===Advantages===\nIn terms of handling, traction and performance, 4WD systems generally have most of the advantages of both front-wheel drive ''and'' rear-wheel drive. Some unique benefits are:\n\n* Traction is nearly doubled compared to a two-wheel-drive layout. Given sufficient power, this results in unparalleled acceleration and driveability on surfaces with less than ideal grip, and superior engine braking on loose surfaces. The development of 4WD systems for high performance cars was stimulated primarily by [[rallying]].\n* Handling characteristics in normal conditions can be configured to emulate FWD or RWD, or some mixture, even to switch between these behaviours according to circumstance. However, at the limit of grip, a well balanced 4WD configuration will not degenerate into either understeer or oversteer, but instead break traction of all 4 wheels at the same time into a four-wheel drift. Combined with modern electronic driving aids, this flexibility allows production car engineers a wide range of freedom in selecting handling characteristics that will allow a 4WD car to be driven more safely at higher speeds by inexpert motorists than 2WD designs.\n\n===Disadvantages===\n* 4WD systems require more machinery and complex transmission components, and so increase the manufacturing cost of the vehicle and complexity of maintenance procedures and repairs compared to 2WD designs\n* 4WD systems increase power-train mass, rotational inertia and power transmission losses, resulting in a reduction in performance in ideal dry conditions and increased fuel consumption compared to 2WD designs\n* The handbrake cannot be used to induce over-steer for maneuvering purposes, as the drivetrain couples the front and rear axles together. To overcome this limitation, some custom prepared stage [[Rallying|rally]] cars have a special mechanism added to the transmission to disconnect the rear drive if the handbrake is applied while the car is moving.\n\n===Unusual 4WD layouts===\n* From 1989 onwards, some models of [[Porsche 911]] feature a rear-engine 4WD layout, which is akin to a longitudinal front-engine 4WD layout installed backwards with the engine at the rear of the car\n* From 2007 onwards, the [[Nissan GT-R]] features a front-engine 4WD longitudinal layout, but with the gearbox at the rear of the vehicle. This provides a more ideal weight balance, and improves directional stability at very high speeds by increasing the vehicle's [[moment of inertia]] around the vertical axis. This layout necessitates a second [[prop-shaft]] to carry power to the front wheels.\n* Some types of farm tractors and construction site machinery use a 4WD layout where the wheels on each ''side'' are coupled together, rather than the wheels on each axle, allowing these vehicles to pivot about their centre point. Such vehicles are controlled in a fashion similar to a military [[tank]].\n* The Citro\u00ebn Sahara had a 4WD system using complete [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]] drivetrains at both ends of the car, such that the engine at the front powered the front wheels and the engine at the back powered the rear wheels.<ref name=UltiCarSahara>[http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/1870/Citroen-2CV-Sahara.html Citro\u00ebn 2CV Sahara at UltimateCarPage.com]</ref>\n* A 'through the road' hybrid vehicle uses a conventional piston engine to power two wheels, with electric motor/generators on the other two wheels, giving a form of part-time 4WD.\n* The 2005 [[Jeep Hurricane]] concept had an all-wheel drive layout that featured two [[V8 engine|V8]] engines powering a single driveshaft, with a gearbox mounted in the centre of the vehicle. The gears connected to two additional driveshafts, one on each side of the vehicle, that delivered power to the wheels via driveshaft joints.<ref name=HowStuffWorks>[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/jeep-hurricane2.htm How the Jeep Hurricane Works at HowStuffWorks.com]</ref> This was designed in order to accommodate the vehicle's unique steering system.\n* The [[Ferrari FF]] features a front-engine 4WD layout in which a separate transmission is used for each pair of driven wheels,<ref name=geek>{{cite web |url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/funky-four-explaining-the-ferrari-ffs-two-gearbox-four-wheel-drive-system/ |title=Funky Four: Explaining the Ferrari FF\u2019s Two-Gearbox Four-Wheel-Drive System |website=Car and Driver Blog |first=Michael |last=Austin |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2014-06-13}}</ref> rather than the more conventional setup in which a single transmission is used, followed by a centre differential or viscous coupling unit to split power between the front and rear wheels.\n\n==History and current use==\n{{update|section|date=June 2012}}\n[[File:Automotive diagrams 03 En.png|thumb|275px|FMR layout, standard in most Front-engine / Rear-wheel-drive cars pre-World War II, where the engine was located behind the front axle.]]\nThe first FR car was an 1895 [[Panhard]] model, so this layout was known as the \"Syst\u00e8me Panhard\" in the early years. Most American cars used the FR layout until the mid-1980s. The [[1973 oil crisis|Oil crisis]] of the 1970s and the success of small FF cars like the [[Mini]], [[Volkswagen Golf]], [[Toyota Tercel]], and [[Honda Civic]] led to the widespread adoption of that layout.\n\nAfter the [[Arab Oil Embargo]] of 1973 and the 1979 fuel crises, a majority of American FR vehicles (station wagons, luxury sedans) were phased out for the FF layout&nbsp;\u2014 this trend would spawn the SUV/van conversion market.  Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, most American companies set as a priority the eventual removal of rear-wheel drive from their mainstream and luxury lineup.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/reviews/a54/1266931/ |title=Comparison Test: Front-Wheel Drive Vs.

In Europe, front-wheel drive was popularized by small cars like the [[Mini]], [[Renault 5]] and [[Volkswagen Golf]] and adopted for virtually all mainstream cars.\n\nUpscale marques like [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[BMW]], and [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] remained mostly independent of this trend, and retained a lineup mostly or entirely made up of FR cars.<ref>[http://www.rearwheeldrive.org/rwd/rwdrate.htm Automaker Ratings<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Japanese mainstream marques such as [[Toyota]] and [[Nissan]] became mostly or entirely FF early on, while reserving for their latterly conceived luxury divisions ([[Lexus]] and [[Infiniti]], respectively) a mostly FR lineup.
