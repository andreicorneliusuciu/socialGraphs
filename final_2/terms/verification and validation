In the post-development phase, verification procedures involve regularly repeating tests devised specifically to ensure that the product, service, or system continues to meet the initial design requirements, specifications, and regulations as time progresses.<ref name=IEEE_1012 /><ref>\"Systems and software engineering - Vocabulary,\" [[ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]/[[IEEE]] std 24765:2010(E), 2010. | verification 6. ...comply with requirements (e.g., for correctness, completeness, consistency, and accuracy) for all life\ncycle activities during each life cycle process (acquisition, supply, development, ''operation'', and ''maintenance'')</ref> It is a process that is used to evaluate whether a product, service, or system complies with regulations, [[specification]]s, or conditions imposed at the start of a development phase. Verification can be in development, scale-up, or production. This is often an internal process.\n\nValidation is intended to ensure a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof) results in a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof) that meets the operational needs of the user.<ref name=IEEE_1012 /><ref>\"Systems and software engineering - Vocabulary,\" [[ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]/[[IEEE]] std 24765:2010(E), 2010. | validation (especially 1. & 2.)</ref> For a new development flow or verification flow, validation procedures may involve modeling either flow and using simulations to predict faults or gaps that might lead to invalid or incomplete verification or development of a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof). A set of validation requirements (as defined by the user), specifications, and regulations may then be used as a basis for qualifying a development flow or verification flow for a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof). Additional validation procedures also include those that are designed specifically to ensure that modifications made to an existing qualified development flow or verification flow will have the effect of producing a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof) that meets the initial design requirements, specifications, and regulations; these validations help to keep the flow qualified.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} It is a process of establishing evidence that provides a high degree of assurance that a product, service, or system accomplishes its intended requirements. This often involves acceptance of fitness for purpose with end users and other product stakeholders. This is often an external process.\n\nIt is sometimes said that validation can be expressed by the query \"Are you building the right thing?\"<ref name=\"Boehm\">[[Barry Boehm]], ''Software Engineering Economics'', 1981</ref> and verification by \"Are you building it right?\".<ref name=\"Boehm\"/> \"Building the right thing\" refers back to the user's needs, while \"building it right\" checks that the specifications are correctly implemented by the system. In some contexts, it is required to have written requirements for both as well as formal procedures or protocols for determining compliance.\n\nIt is entirely possible that a product passes when verified but fails when validated. This can happen when, say, a product is built as per the specifications but the specifications themselves fail to address the user's needs.\n\n== Activities ==\nVerification of machinery and equipment usually consists of design qualification (DQ), installation qualification (IQ), operational qualification (OQ), and performance qualification (PQ).  DQ may be performed by a vendor or by the user, by confirming through review and testing that the equipment meets the written acquisition specification. If the relevant document or manuals of machinery/equipment are provided by vendors, the later 3Q needs to be thoroughly performed by the users who work in an industrial regulatory environment. Otherwise, the process of IQ, OQ and PQ is the task of validation. The typical example of such a case could be the loss or absence of vendor's documentation for legacy equipment or [[do-it-yourself]] (DIY) assemblies (e.g., cars, computers etc.) and, therefore, users should endeavour to acquire DQ document beforehand. Each template of DQ, IQ, OQ and PQ usually can be found on the internet respectively, whereas the DIY qualifications of machinery/equipment can be assisted either by the vendor's training course materials and tutorials, or by the published guidance books, such as ''step-by-step'' series if the acquisition of machinery/equipment is not bundled with on- site qualification services. This kind of the DIY approach is also applicable to the qualifications of software, computer operating systems and a manufacturing process. The most important and critical task as the last step of the activity is to generating and archiving machinery/equipment qualification reports for auditing purposes, if regulatory compliances are mandatory.\n\nQualification of machinery/equipment is venue dependent, in particular items that are shock sensitive and require balancing or [[Positioning technology#Mechanical linkage|calibration]], and re-qualification needs to be conducted once the objects are relocated. The full scales of some equipment qualifications are even time dependent as consumables are used up (i.e. filters) or springs [[Metal fatigue|stretch]] out, requiring [[Positioning technology#Mechanical linkage|recalibration]], and hence re-certification is necessary when a specified due time lapse.<ref name=wel>{{cite web | last = Analytical & Precision Balance Co. | title = Welcome | url = http://www.analyticalandprecision.com/ | accessdate = 18 March 2008 }}</ref><ref name=ec>{{cite web | last = Scientech | title = External Calibration | url = http://www.scalenet.com/scientech/factors.html | accessdate = 18 March 2008 }}</ref> Re-qualification of machinery/equipment should also be conducted when replacement of parts, or coupling with another device, or installing a new [[application software]] and restructuring of the computer which affects especially the pre-settings, such as on [[BIOS]], [[Windows Registry|registry]], [[GUID Partition Table|disk drive partition table]], dynamically-linked (shared) libraries, or an [[ini file]] etc., have been necessary. In such a situation, the specifications of the parts/devices/software and restructuring proposals should be appended to the qualification document whether the parts/devices/software are genuine or not. Torres and Hyman have discussed the suitability of non-genuine parts for clinical use and provided guidelines for equipment users to select appropriate substitutes which are capable to avoid adverse effects.<ref name=rpisi>{{cite web | last = Torres | first = Rebecca E. |author2=William A.

Instead, the asset has to be recycled for non-regulatory purposes.\n\nWhen machinery/equipment qualification is conducted by a standard endorsed third party such as by an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard accredited company for a particular division, the process is called certification.<ref name=iicp>{{cite web | last = AppLabs | title = ISV, IHV Certification Programs | url = http://www.applabs.com/html/certificationprograms.html | accessdate = 26 March 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080216214101/http://www.applabs.com/html/certificationprograms.html |archivedate = 16 February 2008}}</ref><ref name=aaia>{{cite web | last = AppLabs | title = AppLabs attains ISO27001:2005 accreditation | url = http://www.applabs.com/html/ISO270012005Accreditation_230.html | accessdate = 26 March 2008 }}</ref> Currently, the coverage of [[ISO/IEC 15408]] certification by an [[ISO/IEC 27001]] accredited organization is limited, the scheme requires a fair amount of efforts to get popularized.\n\n==Categories of validation==\nValidation work can generally be categorized by the following functions:\n* Prospective validation \u2013 the missions conducted before new items are released to make sure the characteristics of the interests which are functioning properly and which meet safety standards.<ref name=ggpp1>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm124720.htm |title=Guideline on general principles of process validation |publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] |accessdate=12 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606085627/http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm124720.htm |archivedate=6 June 2009 }}</ref><ref name=pv>{{cite web | url = http://www.novasep.com/misc/glossary.asp?defId=169&lookfor=&search=P | title = Prospective validation | publisher = Groupe Novasep | accessdate = 24 September 2008}}</ref> Some examples could be legislative rules, guidelines or proposals,<ref name=pvsfs>{{cite journal | last = Quinn | first = James | last2 = McDermott | first2 = D | last3 = Stiell | first3 = I | last4 = Kohn | first4 = M | last5 = Wells | first5 = G| title = Prospective Validation of the San Francisco Syncope Rule to Predict Patients With Serious Outcomes | journal = Annals of Emergency Medicine | volume = 47 | issue = 5 | pages = 448\u2013454 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | year = 2006 | pmid = 16631985| doi = 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2005.11.019 |display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=pvag>{{cite journal | last = Sangiovanni | first = A. | last2 = Manini | first2 = M | last3 = Iavarone | first3 = M | last4 = Fraquelli | first4 = M | last5 = Forzenigo | first5 = L | last6 = Romeo | first6 = R | last7 = Ronchi | first7 = G | last8 = Colombo | first8 = M| title = Prospective validation of AASLD guidelines for the early diagnosis of epatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients | journal = Digestive and Liver Disease | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = A22\u2013A23 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1016/j.dld.2007.12.064 |display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=pvwp>{{cite journal | last = Germing | first = U. et al.| last2 = Strupp | first2 = C | last3 = Kuendgen | first3 = A | last4 = Isa | first4 = S | last5 = Knipp | first5 = S | last6 = Hildebrandt | first6 = B | last7 = Giagounidis | first7 = A | last8 = Aul | first8 = C | last9 = Gattermann | first9 = N | last10 = Haas| first10 = R| title = Prospective validation of the WHO proposals for the classification of myelodysplastic syndromes | journal = Haematologica | volume = 91 | issue = 12 | pages = 1596\u20131604 | year = 2006 | url = http://haematologica.org/cgi/content/abstract/91/12/1596 | accessdate = 24 September 2008 | pmid = 17145595 | display-authors = 8}}</ref> methods,<ref name=riht>{{cite journal | last = Sciolla | first = Rossella | last2 = Melis | first2 = F | last3 = Sinpac  |first3 = Group| title = Rapid Identification of High-Risk Transient Ischemic Attacks: Prospective Validation of the ABCD Score | journal = Stroke | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 297\u2013302 | publisher = American Heart Association | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.496612 | pmid = 18174479 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> theories/hypothesis/models<ref name=dbsf>{{cite journal | last = Pfisterer | first = Matthias et al. | last2 = Bertel | first2 = O | last3 = Bonetti | first3 = P | last4 = Brunnerlarocca | first4 = H | last5 = Eberli | first5 = F | last6 = Erne | first6 = P | last7 = Galatius | first7 = S | last8 = Hornig | first8 = B | last9 = Kiowski | first9 = W| last10 = Pachinger | first10 = Otmar | last11 = Pedrazzini | first11 = Giovanni | last12 = Rickli | first12 = Hans | last13 = De Servi | first13 = Stefano | last14 = Kaiser | first14 = Christoph | title = Drug-eluting or bare-metal stents forlarge coronary vessel stenting?
