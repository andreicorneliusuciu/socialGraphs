It is used as a measure of [[rotational speed]] of a mechanical component. In the [[French language]], '''tr/mn''' ({{lang|fr|tours par minute}}) is the common abbreviation. The [[German language]] uses the abbreviation  '''U/min''' or '''u/min''' ({{lang|de|Umdrehungen pro Minute}}).\n\n== International System of Units ==\nAccording to the [[International System of Units]] (SI), rpm is not a unit. This is because the word ''revolution'' is a [[Semantics|semantic]] [[annotation]] rather than a unit. The annotation is instead done as a subscript of the formula sign if needed. Because of the measured [[physical quantity]], the formula sign has to be ''f'' for (rotational) [[frequency]] and [[\u03c9]] or [[\u03a9]] for [[angular velocity]]. The corresponding basic [[SI derived unit]] is s<sup>\u22121</sup> or [[Hertz|Hz]]. When measuring angular speed, the unit [[Radian per second|radians per second]] is used.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} 1~\\text{rad/s} & \\leftrightarrow \\frac{1}{2\\pi}~\\text{Hz} \\\\ & \\leftrightarrow \\frac{60}{2\\pi}~\\text{rpm} \\end{align}</math>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} 1~\\text{rpm} & \\leftrightarrow \\frac{1}{60}~\\text{Hz} \\\\ & \\leftrightarrow \\frac{2\\pi}{60}~\\text{rad/s} \\end{align}</math>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} 1~\\text{Hz} & \\leftrightarrow 2\\pi~\\text{rad/s} \\\\ & \\leftrightarrow 60~\\text{rpm} \\end{align}</math>\n\nHere the sign \u2194 (correspondent) is used instead of = (equal). Formally, hertz (Hz) and radian per second (rad/s) are two different names for the same SI unit, s<sup>\u22121</sup>. However, they are used for two different but proportional ISQ quantities: frequency and angular frequency (angular speed, magnitude of angular velocity). The conversion between a frequency ''f'' (measured in hertz) and an angular velocity ''\u03c9'' (measured in radians per second) are:\n:<math>\\omega = 2 \\pi f\\,\\,\\!\\text{, }\\,\\,f = \\frac {\\omega} {2 \\pi}\\text{.}\\,\\!</math>\n\nThus a disc rotating at 60 rpm is said to be rotating at either 2\u03c0 rad/s or 1&nbsp;Hz, where the former measures the angular velocity and the latter reflects the number of revolutions per second.\n\nIf the non-SI unit rpm is considered a unit of frequency, then <math>1~\\text{rpm} = \\frac{1}{60}~\\text{Hz}</math>. If it instead is considered a unit of angular velocity and the word \"revolution\" is considered to mean [[Turn (geometry)|2\u03c0 radians]], then <math>1~\\text{rpm} = \\frac{2\\pi}{60}~\\text{rad/s}</math>.\n\n==Examples==\n{{main|Orders of magnitude (angular velocity)}}\n*On many kinds of disc recording media, the rotational speed of the medium under the read head is a standard given in rpm. [[Gramophone record|Gramophone (phonograph) records]], for example, typically rotate steadily at {{frac|16|2|3}}, {{frac|33|1|3}}, 45 or 78 rpm ({{frac|5|18}}, {{frac|5|9}}, {{frac|3|4}}, or 1.3&nbsp;Hz respectively).\n*Modern ultrasonic [[dental drill]]s can rotate at up to 800,000 rpm (13.3&nbsp;kHz).\n*The \"second\" hand of a conventional analogue clock rotates at 1 rpm.\n*[[Red Book (audio CD standard)|Audio CD]] players read their discs at a precise, constant rate (4.3218 Mbit/s of raw physical data for 1.4112 Mbit/s (176.4 kB/s) of usable audio data) and thus must vary the disc's rotational speed from 8&nbsp;Hz (480 rpm) when reading at the innermost edge, to 3.5&nbsp;Hz (210 rpm) at the outer edge.<ref name=\"MPEG DVD Spec\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mpeg.org/MPEG/DVD/Book_A/Specs.html |title=Physical parameters |work=DVD Technical Notes |publisher=Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) |date=1996-07-21 |accessdate=2008-05-30}}</ref>\n*[[DVD]] players also usually read discs at a constant linear rate. The disc's rotational speed varies from 25.5&nbsp;Hz (1530 rpm) when reading at the innermost edge, to 10.5&nbsp;Hz (630 rpm) at the outer edge.<ref name=\"MPEG DVD Spec\" />\n*A [[washing machine]]'s drum may rotate at 500 to 2000 rpm (8\u201333&nbsp;Hz) during the spin cycles.\n*A power generation turbine ([[Alternator#Synchronous speeds|with a 2 pole alternator]]) rotates at 3000 rpm (50&nbsp;Hz) or 3600 rpm (60&nbsp;Hz), depending on country \u2013 see [[AC power plugs and sockets]].\n* Modern [[automobile]] [[engine]]s are typically operated around 2000\u20133000 rpm (33\u201350&nbsp;Hz) when cruising, with a minimum (idle) speed around 750\u2013900 rpm (12.5\u201315&nbsp;Hz), and an upper limit anywhere from 4500 to 10,000 rpm (75\u2013166&nbsp;Hz) for a road car or nearly 20,000 rpm for racing engines such as [[Formula One engines|those in Formula 1 cars]] (currently limited to 15,000 rpm).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/12877/|title=2014 season changes|publisher=Formula One |accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref> The exhaust note of [[V8 engine|V8]] [[F1 car]]s have a much higher pitch than an [[straight engine|I4 engine]], because each of the cylinders of a [[four-stroke engine]] fires once for every two revolutions of the [[crankshaft]]. Thus an eight-cylinder engine turning 300 times per second will have an exhaust note of 1200&nbsp;Hz.\n*A piston [[aircraft engine]] typically rotates at a rate between 2000 and 3000 rpm (30\u201350&nbsp;Hz).\n*Computer [[hard drive]]s typically rotate at 5400 or 7200 rpm (90 or 120&nbsp;Hz), the most common speeds for the [[Advanced Technology Attachment|ATA]] or [[Serial ATA|SATA]]-based drives in consumer models. High-performance drives (used in fileservers and enthusiast-gaming PCs) rotate at 10,000 or 15,000 rpm (160 or 250&nbsp;Hz), usually with higher-level SATA, [[SCSI]] or [[Fibre Channel]] interfaces and smaller platters to allow these higher speeds, the reduction in storage capacity and ultimate outer-edge speed paying off in much quicker access time and average transfer speed thanks to the high spin rate. Until recently, lower-end and power-efficient laptop drives could be found with 4200 or even 3600 rpm spindle speeds (70 and 60&nbsp;Hz), but these have fallen out of favour due to their lower performance, improvements in energy efficiency in faster models and the takeup of [[solid-state drive]]s for use in slimline and ultraportable laptops. Similar to CD and DVD media, the amount of data that can be stored or read for each turn of the disc is greater at the outer edge than near the spindle; however, hard drives keep a constant rotational speed so the effective data rate is faster at the edge (conventionally, the \"start\" of the disc, opposite to CD/DVD).\n*[[Floppy disc]] drives typically ran at a constant 300 or occasionally 360 rpm (a relatively slow 5 or 6&nbsp;Hz) with a constant per-revolution data density, which was simple and inexpensive to implement, though inefficient. Some designs such as those used with older Apple computers (Lisa, early Macintosh, later II's) were more complex and used variable rotational speeds and per-track storage density (at a constant read/record rate) to store more data per disc; for example, between 394 rpm (with 12 sectors per track) and 590 rpm (8 sectors) with the Mac's 800&nbsp;KB double-density drive at a constant 39.4&nbsp;KB/s (max) \u2013 vs. 300 rpm, 720&nbsp;KB and 23&nbsp;KB/s (max) for double-density drives in other machines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/TA39910?viewlocale=en_US |title=Double-Density Versus High-Density Disks |publisher=Apple |accessdate=2012-05-05}}</ref>\n*A [[Zippe-type centrifuge]] for enriching uranium spins at 90,000 rpm (1,500&nbsp;Hz) or faster.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.electricityforum.com/news/mar04/centrifuge.html |title=Slender and Elegant, It Fuels the Bomb |publisher=The Electricity Forum |accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref>\n*[[Gas turbine]] engines rotate at tens of thousands of rpm.
