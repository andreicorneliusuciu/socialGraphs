It represents the small range of temperatures at which the [[air]] feels neither hot nor cold when wearing the typical indoor clothing. The range is approximately between {{convert|15|C|F|0}} and {{convert|30|C|F|0}}<ref>{{cite book |date=2016|title=Merriam Webster's Medical Dictionary |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/room%20temperature}}</ref> and various methods of [[HVAC|climate control]] are often employed to maintain this thermal comfort level. In certain fields, like science and engineering, and within a particular context, \"room temperature\" may have an agreed upon value for temperature.\n\n==Comfort levels==\n''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' identifies room temperature as around {{convert|20|to|22|C}}.<ref>{{cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|edition=5th|date=2014|url=https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=room+temperature}}</ref>\n\nOwing to variations in humidity and likely clothing, recommendations for summer and winter may vary; a suggested typical range for summer is {{convert|23|C|F}} to {{convert|25.5|C|F|0}}, with that for winter being {{convert|20|C|F}} to {{convert|23.5|C|F|0}}.<ref name=\"airQuality\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBbHmp2yisEC&lpg=PA149&ots=yTqUP4xIOx&dq=%2BASHRAE%20%2B%22recommended%20temperatures%22&pg=PA149#v=onepage&q=+ASHRAE%20+%22recommended%20temperatures%22&f=false|pages=149\u2013151|title=Managing Indoor Air Quality|publisher=Fairmont Press|year=2011|first1=H.

''Ambient temperature'' simply means \"the temperature of the surroundings\" and will be the same as room temperature indoors. In many languages, such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], there is an expression for ''ambient temperature'', but no distinct translation for ''room temperature''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=ambiente|work=WordReference.com Spanish-English Dictionary|publisher=WordReference.com|url=http://www.wordreference.com/es/en/translation.asp?spen=ambiente|accessdate=20 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Environmental engineering]]\n[[Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning]]\n[[Category:Science experiments]]\n[[Category:Temperature]]"}]}}}}
