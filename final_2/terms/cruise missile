Cruise missiles are designed to deliver a large [[warhead]] over long distances with high accuracy; that is, small [[Circular error probable|circular error probability]].  Modern cruise missiles are capable of travelling at [[Supersonic speed|supersonic]] or high [[Aerodynamics#Incompressible aerodynamics|subsonic]] speeds, are self-navigating, and are able to fly on a non-[[Ballistics|ballistic]], extremely low-altitude trajectory. They are distinct from [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAV) in several ways: the cruise missile is a single use weapon which is always sacrificed in the mission; it is not intended to provide [[aerial reconnaissance]]; and the warhead is integrated directly into the hull of the vehicle and cannot be separated. There is considerable overlap between cruise missiles and [[anti-ship missile]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe first cruise missiles to be deployed were the Nazi German [[V-1 flying bomb]] of World War II. Advances in transistor and computer technology have contributed to self-correcting avionic and aeronautical designs that allow missiles to be guided in flight, as opposed to only at launch. These advances developed into guided missiles and guided bombs, and later into the modern cruise missile.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Fieseler Fi-103.jpg|thumb|A Fieseler Fi-103, the German [[V-1 flying bomb]]]]\nThe idea of an \"aerial torpedo\" was shown in the British 1909 film ''[[The Airship Destroyer]]'', where flying torpedoes controlled wirelessly are used to bring down airships bombing London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au/hargrave/rpav_britain.html |title=Remote Piloted Aerial Vehicles : The 'Aerial Target' and 'Aerial Torpedo' in Britain |publisher=Ctie.monash.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2012-02-13}}</ref>\n\nIn 1916, [[Lawrence Sperry]] built and patented an \"aerial torpedo\", a small biplane carrying a TNT charge, a Sperry [[autopilot]] and a barometric altitude control. Inspired by these experiments, the United States Army developed a similar flying bomb called the [[Kettering Bug]]. Germany had also flown trials with remote-controlled aerial gliders (Torpedogleiter) built by Siemens-Schuckert beginning in 1916.<ref>Roger Branfill-Cook, \"Torpedo\", Seaforth Publishing, Great Britain 2014</ref>\n\nIn the period between the World Wars the [[United Kingdom]] developed the [[RAE Larynx|Larynx (Long Range Gun with Lynx Engine)]], which underwent a few flight tests in the 1920s.<ref>[http://www.vectorsite.net/twcruz_1.html#m2 British Aerial Torpedoes]</ref>\n\nIn the [[Soviet Union]], [[Sergei Korolev]] headed the [[Group for the Study of Reactive Motion|GIRD]]-06 cruise missile project from 1932 to 1939, which used a rocket-powered boost-[[glide bomb]] design. The 06/III (RP-216) and 06/IV (RP-212) contained gyroscopic guidance systems.<ref>\"Object No. 212\", 1936 report in _Tvorcheskoi Nasledie Akedemika Sergeya Pavlovicha Koroleva_</ref> The vehicle was designed to boost to 28&nbsp;km altitude and glide a distance of 280&nbsp;km, but test flights in 1934 and 1936 only reached an altitude of 500 meters.\n\n[[Germany]] first deployed cruise style missiles, during [[World War II]]. The V-1, often called a [[flying bomb]], contained a [[gyroscope]] guidance system and was propelled by a simple [[pulsejet]] engine, the sound of which gave it the nickname of \"buzz bomb\" or \"doodlebug\". Accuracy was sufficient only for use against very large targets (the general area of a city), while the range of 250&nbsp;km was significantly lower than that of a bomber carrying the same payload. The main advantages were speed (while not sufficient to outperform contemporary interceptors) and expendability. The production cost of a V-1 was only a small fraction of that of a [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] [[Supersonic speed|supersonic]] [[ballistic missile]], carrying a similar-sized warhead. Unlike the V-2, however, the initial deployments of the V-1 required stationary launch ramps which were susceptible to bombardment. Nazi Germany, in 1943, also developed the [[Mistel]] [[composite aircraft]] program, which can be seen as a rudimentary air-launched cruise missile, where a piloted fighter-type aircraft was mounted atop an unpiloted bomber-sized aircraft that was packed with explosives to be released while approaching the target. Bomber-launched variants of the V-1 saw limited operational service near the end of the war.\n\nImmediately after the war the [[United States Air Force]] had 21 different guided missile projects, including would-be cruise missiles. All were cancelled by 1948, except four&nbsp;\u2014 the [[Air Materiel Command]] [[BANSHEE]], the [[SM-62 Snark]], the [[SM-64 Navaho]], and the [[MGM-1 Matador]]. The BANSHEE design was similar to [[Operation Aphrodite]]; like Aphrodite, it failed, and was cancelled in April 1949.<ref>[http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA162646 The Evolution of the Cruise Missile by Werrell, Kenneth P.] see PDF page 92 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304213844/http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?&verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA162646 |date=March 4, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]] period both the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] experimented further with the concept, deploying early cruise missiles from land, submarines and aircraft. The main outcome of the United States Navy submarine missile project was the [[SSM-N-8 Regulus]] missile, based upon the V-1.\n\nThe United States Air Force's first operational surface-to-surface missile was the winged, mobile, nuclear-capable [[MGM-1 Matador]], also similar in concept to the V-1. Deployment overseas began in 1954, first to West Germany and later to the Republic of China (Taiwan) and South Korea. On November 7, 1956, U.S. Air Force Matador units in West Germany, whose missiles were capable of striking targets in the Warsaw Pact, deployed from their fixed day-to-day sites to unannounced dispersed launch locations. This alert was in response to the crisis posed by the Soviet attack on Hungary which suppressed the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].\n\nBetween 1957 and 1961 the United States followed an ambitious and well-funded program to develop a nuclear-powered cruise missile, [[Supersonic Low Altitude Missile]] (SLAM). It was designed to fly below the enemy's radar at speeds above [[Mach number|Mach]] 3 and carry a number of [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bombs]] that it would drop along its path over enemy territory. Although the concept was proven sound and the 500 [[Watt#Megawatt|megawatt]] engine finished a successful test run in 1961, no airworthy device was ever completed. The project was finally abandoned in favor of [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] development.\n\nWhile [[ballistic missile]]s were the preferred weapons for land targets, heavy nuclear and [[conventional weapon]] tipped cruise missiles were seen by the USSR as a primary weapon to destroy United States naval [[carrier battle group]]s. Large submarines (for example, [[Echo-class submarine|Echo]] and [[Oscar-class submarine|Oscar]] classes) were developed to carry these weapons and shadow United States battle groups at sea, and large bombers (for example, [[Tupolev Tu-22M|Backfire]], [[Tupolev Tu-95|Bear]], and [[Tupolev Tu-160|Blackjack]] models) were equipped with the weapons in their air-launched cruise missile (ALCM) configuration.\n\n==General design==\nCruise missiles generally consist of a [[guidance system]], payload, and [[aircraft propulsion]] system, housed in an [[airframe]] with small wings and [[empennage]] for flight control. Payloads usually consist of a conventional warhead or a [[Nuclear Weapon|nuclear warhead]]. Cruise missiles tend to be propelled by a [[jet engine]], [[turbofan]] engines being preferred due to their greater efficiency at low altitude and subsonic speed.\n\n===Guidance systems===\n{{Main article|Missile guidance}}\nGuidance systems also vary greatly. Low-cost systems use a [[radar altimeter]], barometric altimeter and [[clock]] to navigate a [[Digital data|digital]] strip [[map]]. More advanced systems use [[inertial guidance]], [[satellite guidance]] and [[TERCOM|terrain contour matching (TERCOM)]]. Use of an [[automatic target recognition|automatic target recognition (ATR)]] algorithm/device in the guidance system increases accuracy of the missile. The [[Standoff Land Attack Missile]] features an ATR unit from [[General Electric]].\n\n==Categories==\nCruise missiles can be categorized by size, speed (subsonic or supersonic), and range, and whether launched from land, air, surface ship, or submarine. Often versions of the same missile are produced for different launch platforms; sometimes air- and submarine-launched versions are a little lighter and smaller than land- and ship-launched versions.\n\nGuidance systems can vary across missiles. Some missiles can be fitted with any of a variety of navigation systems ([[Inertial navigation]], [[TERCOM]], or [[satellite navigation]]). Larger cruise missiles can carry either a conventional or a nuclear warhead, while smaller ones carry only conventional warheads.\n\n===Hypersonic===\nA [[Hypersonic speed]] cruise missile would travel at least five times the [[speed of sound]] ([[Mach number|Mach]] 5).\n*[[Kh-90]] {{flagicon|USSR}}/{{flagicon|RUS}} is a hypersonic [[Air-to-surface missile|Air-to-surface cruise missile]] developed in 1990 by the USSR and later by Russia.

The truck-launched versions, and also the Pershing II and SS-20 Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles, were later destroyed under the bilateral INF (Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces) treaty with the USSR.\n\nThe British [[Royal Navy]] (RN) also operates cruise missiles, specifically the U.S.-made Tomahawk, used by the RN's nuclear submarine fleet. UK conventional warhead versions were first fired in combat by the RN in 1999, during the [[Kosovo War]] (the United States fired cruise missiles in 1991). The [[Royal Air Force]] uses the [[Storm Shadow]] cruise missile on its [[Tornado GR4]] aircraft. It is also used by France, where it is known as SCALP EG, and carried by the [[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]]'s [[Mirage 2000]] and [[Rafale]] aircraft.\n\n[[India]] and [[Russia]] have jointly developed the supersonic cruise missile [[BrahMos]]. There are three versions of the Brahmos: ship/land-launched, air-launched and sub-launched. The ship/land-launched version were operational as of late 2007. The Brahmos has the capability to attack targets on land. Russia also continues to operate other cruise missiles: the [[SS-N-12 Sandbox]], [[SS-N-19 Shipwreck]], [[SS-N-22 Sunburn]] and [[Kh-35|SS-N-25 Switchblade]]. [[Germany]] and [[Spain]] operate the [[KEPD 350|Taurus missile]] while [[Pakistan]] has developed its own cruise missile somewhat similar to Tomahawk cruise missile, named the [[Babur missile]]. Both the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]) have designed several cruise missile variants, such as the well-known [[C-802]], some of which are capable of carrying biological, chemical, nuclear, and conventional warheads.\n\n===Nuclear warhead versions===\n\n====France====\n{{See also|France and weapons of mass destruction}}\n\nThe French [[Force de Frappe]] nuclear forces include both land and sea based bombers with [[Air-Sol Moyenne Port\u00e9e]] high speed medium range nuclear cruise missiles.

They are equipped with a [[TERCOM]] system which allows them to cruise at an altitude lower than 110 meters at subsonic speeds while obtaining a [[Circular Error Probable|CEP]] accuracy of 15 meters with an [[Inertial navigation system]]. They are air-launched from either [[Tupolev Tu-95]]s, [[Tupolev Tu-22M]]s, or [[Tupolev Tu-160]]s, each able to carry 16 for the Tu-95, 12 for the Tu-160, and 4 for the Tu-22M. A [[Stealth technology|stealth]] version of the missile, the Kh-101 is in development. It has similar qualities as the Kh-55, except that its range has been extended to 5,000&nbsp;km, equipped with a 1,000&nbsp;kg conventional warhead, and has stealth features which reduces its probability of intercept.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/bomber/kh-101.htm |title=Kh-101 - Russian and Soviet Nuclear Forces |publisher=Fas.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-13}}</ref>\n\n====United States====\n{{See also|United States and weapons of mass destruction}}\n[[File:Agm-129 acm.jpg|thumb|right|An [[AGM-129 ACM]] of the [[United States Air Force]]]]\n\nThe United States has deployed four nuclear cruise missiles at one time or another.\n*[[SSM-N-8 Regulus]] submarine-launched missile, out of service\n*[[AGM-86 ALCM]] air-launched cruise missile, 350 to 550 missiles and [[W80 (nuclear warhead)|W80]] warheads still in service\n*[[Tomahawk (missile)|BGM-109 Tomahawk]] cruise missile in nuclear submarine-, surface ship-, and ground-launched models, nuclear models out of service but warheads kept in reserve.\n*[[AGM-129 ACM]] Advanced Cruise missile, out of service <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tinker.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123299303 |title=Cruise missile career comes to a close |publisher= U.S. Air Force, Tinker Air Force Base public affairs |date=2012-04-24 |accessdate=2012-12-27}}</ref>\n\n===Efficiency in modern warfare===\nCurrently cruise missiles are among the most expensive of single-use weapons, up to several million dollars apiece. One consequence of this is that its users face difficult choices in [[targeting (warfare)|target allocation]], to avoid expending the missiles on targets of low value. For instance during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] the United States attacked targets of very low monetary value with cruise missiles, which led many to question the efficiency of the weapon. However, proponents of the cruise missile counter that the same argument applies to other types of [[unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s: they are cheaper than human pilots when total training and infrastructure costs are taken into account, not to mention the risk of loss of personnel. As demonstrated in [[Operation Odyssey Dawn]] and prior conflicts, cruise missiles are much more difficult to detect and intercept than other aerial assets (reduced radar cross-section, infrared and visual signature due to smaller size), suiting them to attacks against static air defense systems.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Affordable Weapon System]]\n* [[Cruise missile submarine]]\n* [[Eugene Vielle]] (pioneer of technology that led to the Cruise missile)\n* [[Expendable launch system]]\n* [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]]\n* [[List of missiles]]\n* [[List of missiles by country]]\n* [[List of rocket aircraft]]\n* [[Lists of weapons]]\n* [[Low Cost Miniature Cruise Missile]]\n* [[NATO reporting name]] (has lists of various Soviet missiles)\n* [[Submarine-launched cruise missile]]\n* [[Surface-to-surface missile]]\n* [[Weapon of mass destruction]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons}}\n*[http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA162646 The Evolution of the Cruise Missile by Werrell, Kenneth P.]\n*[http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1981/jan-feb/werrell.htm The Cruise Missile: Precursors and Problems by Werrell, Kenneth P.]\n*[https://fas.org/nuke/intro/cm/index.html An introduction to cruise missiles]&nbsp;\u2014 From the website of the Federation of American Scientists (FAS)\n*[https://fas.org/irp/threat/missile/ADA377356.pdf Feasibility of Third World Advanced Ballistic & Cruise Missile Threat] NDIA 155 slide presentation from 1999\n*[http://www.aardvark.co.nz/pjet/cruise.shtml The DIY cruise missile]\n*[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/W80.html The W80 Warhead]\n*[http://www.ausairpower.net/TE-Cruise-Missiles-1985.html Cruise Missile Fundamentals]\n*[http://www.ausairpower.net/Tomahawk-Subtypes.html Tomahawk Variants]\n*[http://www.strategycenter.net/research/pubID.112/pub_detail.asp Bypassing the NMD: China and the Cruise Missile Proliferation Problem (Kh-55)]\n*[http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=6e0f843efd Video of cruise missile formation over Iraq]\n*[http://www.skilligent.com/products/robot-navigation.shtml A commercial terrain matching image-based navigation system (with video)]\n\n{{Missile types}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cruise Missile}}\n[[Category:Cruise missiles| ]]\n[[Category:Missile types]]"}]}}}}
