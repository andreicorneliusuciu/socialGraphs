In [[celestial mechanics]] these elements are generally considered in [[classical mechanics|classical]] [[two-body system]]s, where a [[Kepler orbit]] is used (derived from [[Newton's laws of motion]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]]). There are many different ways to mathematically describe the same orbit, but certain schemes, each consisting of a set of six parameters, are commonly used in [[astronomy]] and [[orbital mechanics]].\n\nA real orbit (and its elements) changes over time due to gravitational [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] by other objects and the effects of [[General relativity|relativity]]. A Keplerian orbit is merely an idealized, mathematical approximation at a particular time.\n\n== Keplerian elements ==\n[[Image:Orbit1.svg|thumb|400px|right|In this diagram, the [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] (yellow) intersects a reference plane (gray). For Earth-orbiting satellites, the reference plane is usually the Earth's equatorial plane, and for satellites in solar orbits it is the [[plane of the ecliptic|ecliptic plane]]. The intersection is called the [[Orbital node|line of nodes]], as it connects the center of mass with the ascending and descending nodes. This plane, together with the [[Equinox|vernal point]] (<big>\u2648</big>), establishes a reference frame.]]\nThe traditional orbital elements are the six '''Keplerian elements''', after [[Johannes Kepler]] and his [[Kepler's laws|laws of planetary motion]].\n\nWhen viewed from an [[inertial frame]], two orbiting bodies trace out distinct trajectories. Each of these trajectories has its focus at the common [[center of mass]]. When viewed from a non-inertial frame centred on one of the bodies, only the trajectory of the opposite body is apparent; Keplerian elements describe these non-inertial trajectories. An orbit has two sets of Keplerian elements depending on which body is used as the point of reference. The reference body is called the ''[[primary (astronomy)|primary]]'', the other body is called the ''secondary''. The primary does not necessarily possess more mass than the secondary, and even when the bodies are of equal mass, the orbital elements depend on the choice of the primary.\n\nThe main two elements that define the shape and size of the ellipse:\n* [[Eccentricity (orbit)|Eccentricity]] ({{mvar|e}})\u2014shape of the ellipse, describing how much it is elongated compared to a circle (not marked in diagram).\n* [[Semimajor axis]] ({{mvar|a}})\u2014the sum of the [[apsis|periapsis and apoapsis distances]] divided by two. For circular orbits, the semimajor axis is the distance between the centers of the bodies, not the distance of the bodies from the center of mass.\n\nTwo elements define the orientation of the [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] in which the ellipse is embedded:\n* [[Inclination]]\u2014vertical tilt of the ellipse with respect to the reference plane, measured at the [[ascending node]] (where the orbit passes upward through the reference plane, the green angle {{mvar|i}} in the diagram). Tilt angle is measured perpendicular to line of intersection between orbital plane and reference plane. Any three points on an ellipse will define the ellipse orbital plane. The plane and the ellipse are both two-dimensional objects defined in three-dimensional space.\n* [[Longitude of the ascending node]]\u2014horizontally orients the [[ascending node]] of the ellipse (where the orbit passes upward through the reference plane) with respect to the reference frame's [[vernal point]] (the green angle {{mvar|\u03a9}} in the diagram).\n\nAnd finally:\n* [[Argument of periapsis]] defines the orientation of the ellipse in the orbital plane, as an angle measured from the ascending node to the periapsis (the closest point the satellite object comes to the primary object around which it orbits, the blue angle {{mvar|\u03c9}} in the diagram).\n* [[True anomaly]] at [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] ({{math|''M''<sub>0</sub>}}) defines the position of the orbiting body along the ellipse at a specific time (the \"epoch\").\n\nThe mean anomaly is a mathematically convenient \"angle\" which varies linearly with time, but which does not correspond to a real geometric angle. It can be converted into the [[true anomaly]] {{mvar|\u03bd}}, which does represent the real geometric angle in the plane of the ellipse, between [[periapsis]] (closest approach to the central body) and the position of the orbiting object at any given time. Thus, the true anomaly is shown as the red angle {{mvar|\u03bd}} in the diagram, and the mean anomaly is not shown.\n\nThe angles of inclination, longitude of the ascending node, and argument of periapsis can also be described as the [[Euler angles]] defining the orientation of the orbit relative to the reference coordinate system.\n\nNote that non-elliptic trajectories also exist, but are not closed, and are thus not orbits. If the eccentricity is greater than one, the trajectory is a [[hyperbola]]. If the eccentricity is equal to one and the angular momentum is zero, the trajectory is [[radial trajectory|radial]]. If the eccentricity is one and there is angular momentum, the trajectory is a [[parabola]].\n\n=== Required parameters ===\nGiven an [[inertial frame of reference]] and an arbitrary [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] (a specified point in time), exactly six parameters are necessary to unambiguously define an arbitrary and unperturbed orbit.\n\nThis is because the problem contains six [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]]. These correspond to the three spatial [[dimension]]s which define position ({{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, {{mvar|z}} in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]]), plus the velocity in each of these dimensions. These can be described as [[orbital state vectors]], but this is often an inconvenient way to represent an orbit, which is why Keplerian elements are commonly used instead.\n\nSometimes the epoch is considered a \"seventh\" orbital parameter, rather than part of the reference frame.\n\nIf the epoch is defined to be at the moment when one of the elements is zero, the number of unspecified elements is reduced to five. (The sixth parameter is still necessary to define the orbit; it is merely numerically set to zero by convention or \"moved\" into the definition of the epoch with respect to real-world clock time.)\n\n=== Alternative parametrizations ===\nKeplerian elements can be obtained from [[orbital state vectors]] (three vectors for the position and three for the velocity) by manual transformations or with computer software.<ref>For example, with [http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/information/faqs/sv_keps.php VEC2TLE]</ref>\n\nOther orbital parameters can be computed from the Keplerian elements such as the [[Orbital period|period]], [[apsis|apoapsis, and periapsis]]. (When orbiting the Earth, the last two terms are known as the apogee and perigee.) It is common to specify the period instead of the semi-major axis in Keplerian element sets, as each can be computed from the other provided the [[standard gravitational parameter]], {{mvar|GM}}, is given for the central body.\n\nInstead of the [[mean anomaly]] at [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]], the [[mean anomaly]] {{mvar|M}}, [[mean longitude]], [[true anomaly]] {{math|''\u03bd''<sub>0</sub>}}, or (rarely) the [[eccentric anomaly]] might be used.\n\nUsing, for example, the \"mean anomaly\" instead of \"mean anomaly at epoch\" means that time {{mvar|t}} must be specified as a seventh orbital element. Sometimes it is assumed that mean anomaly is zero at the epoch (by choosing the appropriate definition of the epoch), leaving only the five other orbital elements to be specified.\n\nDifferent sets of elements are used for various astronomical bodies. The eccentricity, {{mvar|e}}, and either the semi-major axis, {{mvar|a}}, or the distance of periapsis, {{mvar|q}}, are used to specify the shape and size of an orbit. The angle of the ascending node, {{mvar|\u03a9}}, the inclination, {{mvar|i}}, and the argument of periapsis, {{mvar|\u03c9}}, or the longitude of periapsis, {{mvar|\u03d6}}, specify the orientation of the orbit in its plane. Either the longitude at epoch, {{math|''L''<sub>0</sub>}}, the mean anomaly at epoch, {{math|''M''<sub>0</sub>}}, or the time of perihelion passage, {{math|''T''<sub>0</sub>}}, are used to specify a known point in the orbit. The choices made depend whether the vernal equinox or the node are used as the primary reference. The semi-major axis is known if the mean motion and the [[Mass#Gravitational mass|gravitational mass]] are known.<ref name=\"Green\">{{cite book |last=Green |first=Robin M. |date=1985 |title=Spherical Astronomy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-23988-2}}</ref><ref name=\"Danby\">{{cite book |last=Danby |first=J. M. A. |date=1962 |title=Fundamentals of Celestial Mechanics |publisher=Willmann-Bell |isbn=978-0-943396-20-0}}</ref>\n\nIt is also quite common to see either the mean anomaly ({{mvar|M}}) or the mean longitude ({{mvar|L}}) expressed directly, without either {{math|''M''<sub>0</sub>}} or {{math|''L''<sub>0</sub>}} as intermediary steps, as a [[polynomial]] function with respect to time. This method of expression will consolidate the mean motion ({{mvar|n}}) into the polynomial as one of the coefficients. The appearance will be that {{mvar|L}} or {{mvar|M}} are expressed in a more complicated manner, but we will appear to need one fewer orbital element.\n\nMean motion can also be obscured behind citations of the orbital period {{mvar|P}}.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Sets of orbital elements\n!

Real orbits have perturbations, so a given set of Keplerian elements accurately describes an orbit only at the epoch. Evolution of the orbital elements takes place due to the [[gravitational]] pull of bodies other than the primary, the [[sphericity|nonsphericity]] of the primary, [[atmospheric]] [[Drag (physics)|drag]], [[theory of relativity|relativistic effects]], [[radiation pressure]], [[electromagnetic force]]s, and so on.\n\nKeplerian elements can often be used to produce useful predictions at times near the epoch. Alternatively, real trajectories can be modeled as a sequence of Keplerian orbits that [[Osculating orbit|osculate]] (\"kiss\" or touch) the real trajectory. They can also be described by the so-called planetary equations, differential equations which come in different forms developed by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], [[Charles-Eug\u00e8ne Delaunay|Delaunay]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9|Poincar\u00e9]], or [[George William Hill|Hill]].\n\n== Two-line elements ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Epoch (astronomy)]] -->\n{{Main|Two-line elements}}\nKeplerian elements parameters can be encoded as text in a number of formats. The most common of them is the [[NASA]]/[[NORAD]] '''\"two-line elements\"''' (TLE) format,<ref name=\"Kelso_FAQ\">{{cite web|last1=Kelso|first1=T.S.|title=CelesTrak: \"FAQs: Two-Line Element Set Format\"|url=http://celestrak.com/columns/v04n03/|website=celestrak.com|accessdate=15 June 2016}}</ref> originally designed for use with 80-column punched cards, but still in use because it is the most common format, and can be handled easily by all modern data storages as well.\n\nDepending on the application and object orbit, the data derived from TLEs older than 30 days can become unreliable.
