The time it remains in each state is determined by the time constant of an RC circuit. Therefore, it is a [[relaxation oscillator]], and can produce [[square wave]]s or [[triangle wave]]s.\n*''[[Monostable Multivibrator|Monostable multivibrator]]'' \u2013 is a circuit with one unstable state and one stable state. When in its stable state a pulse is applied to the input, the output switches to its other state and remains in it for a period of time dependent on the time constant of the RC circuit, then switches back to the stable state. Thus the monostable can be used as a timer or delay element.\n*''[[Bistable multivibrator]]'' or ''[[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip flop]]'' \u2013 is a circuit with two stable states.
