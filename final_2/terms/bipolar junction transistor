From top to bottom: [[TO-3]], [[TO-126]], [[TO-92]], [[Small-outline transistor|SOT-23]]]]\n\nA '''bipolar junction transistor''' ('''bipolar transistor''' or '''BJT''') is a type of [[transistor]] that uses both [[electron]] and [[electron hole|hole]] charge carriers. In contrast, unipolar transistors, such as [[field-effect transistor]]s, only use one kind of charge carrier. For their operation, BJTs use two junctions between two [[semiconductor]] types, n-type and p-type.\n\nBJTs are manufactured in two types, NPN and PNP, and are available as individual components, or fabricated in [[integrated circuit]]s, often in large numbers. The basic function of a BJT is to amplify current. This allows BJTs to be used as [[Electronic amplifier|amplifiers]] or switches, giving them wide applicability in electronic equipment, including computers, televisions, mobile phones, audio amplifiers, industrial control, and radio transmitters.\n\n==Note on current direction==\n\nBy convention, the direction of current on diagrams is shown as the direction that a positive charge would move.  This is called ''conventional current''.  However, current in metal conductors is due to the flow of electrons which, because they carry a negative charge, move in the opposite direction to conventional current.  On the other hand, inside a bipolar transistor, currents can be composed of both positively charged holes and negatively charged electrons.  In this article, current arrows are shown in the conventional direction, but labels for the movement of holes and electrons show their actual direction inside the transistor.\n\n==Function==\n\n{{technical|section|date=July 2012}}\n\nBJTs come in two types, or polarities, known as PNP and NPN based on the [[Doping (semiconductors)|doping]] types of the three main terminal regions.  An NPN transistor comprises two [[P&ndash;n junction|semiconductor junctions]] that share a thin p-doped [[anode]] region, and a PNP transistor comprises two semiconductor junctions that share a thin n-doped [[cathode]] region.\n\n[[Image:NPN BJT Basic Operation (Active).svg|thumb|942x942px|NPN BJT with forward-biased E\u2013B junction and reverse-biased B\u2013C junction|center]]\n\nCharge flow in a BJT is due to [[diffusion]] of [[Charge carriers in semiconductors|charge carriers]] across a junction between two regions of different charge concentrations. The regions of a BJT are called ''emitter'', ''collector'', and ''base''.<ref group=\"note\" >See [[point-contact transistor]] for the historical origin of these names.</ref> A discrete transistor has three leads for connection to these regions. Typically, the emitter region is heavily doped compared to the other two layers, whereas the majority charge carrier concentrations in base and collector layers are about the same. By design, most of the BJT collector current is due to the flow of charges injected from a high-concentration emitter into the base where they are [[minority carrier]]s that diffuse toward the collector, and so BJTs are classified as minority-carrier devices.\n\nIn typical operation, the base\u2013emitter [[p-n junction|junction]] is [[p-n junction#Forward bias|forward bias]]ed, which means that the p-doped side of the junction is at a more positive potential than the n-doped side, and the base\u2013collector junction is [[p-n junction#Reverse bias|reverse bias]]ed. In an NPN transistor, when positive bias is applied to the base\u2013emitter junction, the equilibrium is disturbed between the thermally generated [[charge carrier|carrier]]s and the repelling electric field of the n-doped emitter [[depletion region]]. This allows thermally excited electrons to inject from the emitter into the base region. These electrons [[diffusion|diffuse]] through the base from the region of high concentration near the emitter towards the region of low concentration near the collector. The electrons in the base are called ''[[minority carrier]]s'' because the base is doped p-type, which makes [[Electron hole|holes]] the ''[[majority carrier]]'' in the base.\n\nTo minimize the percentage of carriers that [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombine]] before reaching the collector\u2013base junction, the transistor's base region must be thin enough that carriers can diffuse across it in much less time than the semiconductor's minority carrier lifetime. In particular, the thickness of the base must be much less than the [[Fick's law#Example solution in one dimension: diffusion length|diffusion length]] of the electrons. The collector\u2013base junction is reverse-biased, and so little electron injection occurs from the collector to the base, but electrons that diffuse through the base towards the collector are swept into the collector by the electric field in the depletion region of the collector\u2013base junction. The thin ''shared'' base and asymmetric collector&ndash;emitter doping are what differentiates a bipolar transistor from two ''separate'' and oppositely biased diodes connected in series.\n\n===Voltage, current, and charge control===\nThe collector\u2013emitter current can be viewed as being controlled by the base\u2013emitter current (current control), or by the base\u2013emitter voltage (voltage control). These views are related by the current\u2013voltage relation of the base\u2013emitter junction, which is just the usual exponential current\u2013voltage curve of a [[p-n junction]] (diode).<ref name= \"hh\">{{cite book | author = [[Paul Horowitz]] and [[Winfield Hill]] | title = The Art of Electronics | edition = 2nd | year = 1989 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-37095-0 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bkOMDgwFA28C&pg=PA113&dq=bjt+charge+current+voltage+control+inauthor:horowitz+inauthor:hill}}</ref>\n\nThe physical explanation for collector current is the concentration of minority carriers in the base region.<ref name=hh/><ref>{{cite book | title = Semiconductor Device Physics and Simulation | author = Juin Jei Liou and Jiann S.

However, because base charge is not a signal that is visible at the terminals, the current- and voltage-control views are generally used in circuit design and analysis.\n\nIn [[analog circuit]] design, the current-control view is sometimes used because it is approximately linear. That is, the collector current is approximately <math>\\beta_F</math> times the base current. Some basic circuits can be designed by assuming that the emitter\u2013base voltage is approximately constant, and that collector current is beta times the base current. However, to accurately and reliably design production BJT circuits, the voltage-control (for example, [[Ebers\u2013Moll model|Ebers\u2013Moll]]) model is required.<ref name=hh/> The voltage-control model requires an exponential function to be taken into account, but when it is linearized such that the transistor can be modeled as a transconductance, as in the [[Ebers\u2013Moll model]], design for circuits such as differential amplifiers again becomes a mostly linear problem, so the voltage-control view is often preferred. For [[translinear circuit]]s, in which the exponential I\u2013V curve is key to the operation, the transistors are usually modeled as voltage-controlled current sources whose [[transconductance]] is proportional to their collector current. In general, transistor-level circuit design is performed using [[SPICE]] or a comparable analog circuit simulator, so model complexity is usually not of much concern to the designer.\n\n===Turn-on, turn-off, and storage delay===\nThe bipolar transistor exhibits a few delay characteristics when turning on and off. Most transistors, and especially power transistors, exhibit long base-storage times that limit maximum frequency of operation in switching applications. One method for reducing this storage time is by using a [[Baker clamp]].\n\n===Transistor parameters: alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2) {{Anchor|Alpha|Beta}}===\nThe proportion of electrons able to cross the base and reach the collector is a measure of the BJT efficiency. The heavy doping of the emitter region and light doping of the base region causes many more electrons to be injected from the emitter into the base than holes to be injected from the base into the emitter.\n\nThe ''[[common-emitter]] current gain'' is represented by \u03b2<sub>F</sub> or the [[Two-port network#h-parameters|h-parameter]] h<sub>FE</sub>; it is approximately the ratio of the DC collector current to the DC base current in forward-active region. It is typically greater than 50 for small-signal transistors but can be smaller in transistors designed for high-power applications.\n\nAnother important parameter is the ''[[common-base]] current gain'', \u03b1<sub>F</sub>. The common-base current gain is approximately the gain of current from emitter to collector in the forward-active region. This ratio usually has a value close to unity; between 0.980 and 0.998. It is less than unity due to [[carrier generation and recombination|recombination of charge carriers]] as they cross the base region.\n\nAlpha and beta are more precisely related by the following identities (NPN transistor):\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\alpha_F &= \\frac{I_\\text{C}}{I_\\text{E}},& \\beta_F &= \\frac{I_\\text{C}}{I_\\text{B}} \\\\\n  \\alpha_F &= \\frac{\\beta_F}{1 + \\beta_F}& \\iff \\beta_F &= \\frac{\\alpha_F}{1 - \\alpha_F}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==Structure==\n\n[[File:NPN BJT (Planar) Cross-section.svg|frame|left|Simplified cross section of a planar ''NPN'' bipolar junction transistor|300x300px]]\n\nA BJT consists of three differently [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] semiconductor regions: the ''emitter'' region, the ''base'' region and the ''collector'' region. These regions are, respectively, ''p'' type, ''n'' type and ''p'' type in a PNP transistor, and ''n'' type, ''p'' type and ''n'' type in an NPN transistor. Each semiconductor region is connected to a terminal, appropriately labeled: ''emitter'' (E), ''base'' (B) and ''collector'' (C).\n\nThe ''base'' is physically located between the ''emitter'' and the ''collector'' and is made from lightly doped, high-resistivity material. The collector surrounds the emitter region, making it almost impossible for the electrons injected into the base region to escape without being collected, thus making the resulting value of \u03b1 very close to unity, and so, giving the transistor a large \u03b2. A cross-section view of a BJT indicates that the collector\u2013base junction has a much larger area than the emitter\u2013base junction.\n\nThe bipolar junction transistor, unlike other transistors, is usually not a symmetrical device. This means that interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the transistor leave the forward active mode and start to operate in reverse mode. Because the transistor's internal structure is usually optimized for forward-mode operation, interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 in reverse operation much smaller than those in forward operation; often the \u03b1 of the reverse mode is lower than 0.5. The lack of symmetry is primarily due to the doping ratios of the emitter and the collector. The emitter is heavily doped, while the collector is lightly doped, allowing a large reverse bias voltage to be applied before the collector\u2013base junction breaks down. The collector\u2013base junction is reverse biased in normal operation. The reason the emitter is heavily doped is to increase the emitter injection efficiency: the ratio of carriers injected by the emitter to those injected by the base. For high current gain, most of the carriers injected into the emitter\u2013base junction must come from the emitter.\n\n[[Image:Transistor-die-KSY34.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Die of a KSY34 high-frequency NPN transistor. Bond wires connect to the base and emitter]]\n\nThe low-performance \"lateral\" bipolar transistors sometimes used in [[CMOS]] processes are sometimes designed symmetrically, that is, with no difference between forward and backward operation.\n\nSmall changes in the voltage applied across the base\u2013emitter terminals cause the current between the ''emitter'' and the ''collector'' to change significantly. This effect can be used to amplify the input voltage or current. BJTs can be thought of as voltage-controlled [[current source]]s, but are more simply characterized as current-controlled current sources, or current amplifiers, due to the low impedance at the base.\n\nEarly transistors were made from [[germanium]] but most modern BJTs are made from [[silicon]]. A significant minority are also now made from [[gallium arsenide]], especially for very high speed applications (see HBT, below).\n\n===NPN===\n[[Image:BJT NPN symbol (case).svg|thumb|100px|The symbol of an NPN BJT. A mnemonic for the symbol is \"'''n'''ot '''p'''ointing i'''n'''\".]]\nNPN is one of the two types of bipolar transistors, consisting of a layer of P-[[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] semiconductor (the \"base\") between two N-doped layers. A small current entering the base is amplified to produce a large collector and emitter current. That is, when there is a positive potential difference measured from the emitter of an NPN transistor to its base (i.e., when the base is '''high''' relative to the emitter) as well as positive potential difference measured from the base to the collector, the transistor becomes active. In this \"on\" state, charge flows between the collector and emitter of the transistor. Most of the current is carried by electrons moving from emitter to collector as [[minority carrier]]s in the P-type base region. To allow for greater current and faster operation, most bipolar transistors used today are NPN because [[electron mobility]] is higher than [[hole mobility]].\n\nA [[mnemonic]] device for the NPN transistor symbol is \"''n''ot ''p''ointing i''n''\", based on the arrows in the symbol and the letters in the name.<ref name=mnemnpn>{{cite book\n | title = Essentials of electronic circuitry\n | author = Alphonse J.

A small current leaving the base is amplified in the collector output. That is, a PNP transistor is \"on\" when its base is pulled '''low''' relative to the emitter.\nIn a PNP transistor, emitter-base region is forward biased, so electric field and carriers will be generated. They should flow towards the base junction, but the base part is very thin and has low conductivity. The reverse-biased collector base part has generated holes. Thus, due to the electric field, carriers or electrons get pulled by the holes.\n\nThe arrows in the NPN and PNP transistor symbols are on the emitter legs and point in the direction of the [[conventional current]] when the device is in forward active mode.\n\nA mnemonic device for the PNP transistor symbol is \"''p''ointing i''n'' (''p''roudly/''p''ermanently)\", based on the arrows in the symbol and the letters in the name.<ref name=mnempnp>{{cite book\n | title = Essentials of electronic circuitry\n | author = Alphonse J.

Usually the emitter is composed of a larger bandgap material than the base. The figure shows that this difference in bandgap allows the barrier for holes to inject backward from the base into the emitter, denoted in the figure as \u0394\u03c6<sub>p</sub>, to be made large, while the barrier for electrons to inject into the base \u0394\u03c6<sub>n</sub> is made low. This barrier arrangement helps reduce minority carrier injection from the base when the emitter-base junction is under forward bias, and thus reduces base current and increases emitter injection efficiency.\n\nThe improved injection of carriers into the base allows the base to have a higher doping level, resulting in lower resistance to access the base electrode. In the more traditional BJT, also referred to as homojunction BJT, the efficiency of carrier injection from the emitter to the base is primarily determined by the doping ratio between the emitter and base, which means the base must be lightly doped to obtain high injection efficiency, making its resistance relatively high. In addition, higher doping in the base can improve figures of merit like the [[Early voltage]] by lessening base narrowing.\n\nThe grading of composition in the base, for example, by progressively increasing the amount of germanium in a [[SiGe]] transistor, causes a gradient in bandgap in the neutral base, denoted in the figure by \u0394\u03c6<sub>G</sub>, providing a \"built-in\" field that assists electron transport across the base. That [[drift transistor|drift component]] of transport aids the normal diffusive transport, increasing the frequency response of the transistor by shortening the transit time across the base.\n\nTwo commonly used HBTs are silicon\u2013germanium and aluminum gallium arsenide, though a wide variety of semiconductors may be used for the HBT structure. HBT structures are usually grown by [[epitaxy]] techniques like [[Metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy|MOCVD]] and [[Molecular beam epitaxy|MBE]].\n\n==Regions of operation==<!-- This section is linked from [[Emitter-coupled logic]] -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;margin-left:1em\"\n!

Most bipolar transistors are designed to afford the greatest common-emitter current gain, \u03b2<sub>F</sub>, in forward-active mode. If this is the case, the collector\u2013emitter current is approximately  [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the base current, but many times larger, for small base current variations.\n;Reverse-active (or ''inverse-active'' or ''inverted''): By reversing the biasing conditions of the forward-active region, a bipolar transistor goes into reverse-active mode. In this mode, the emitter and collector regions switch roles. Because most BJTs are designed to maximize current gain in forward-active mode, the \u03b2<sub>F</sub> in inverted mode is several times smaller (2\u20133 times for the ordinary germanium transistor). This transistor mode is seldom used, usually being considered only for failsafe conditions and some types of bipolar logic. The reverse bias breakdown voltage to the base may be an order of magnitude lower in this region.\n;Saturation: With both junctions forward-biased, a BJT is in saturation mode and facilitates high current conduction from the emitter to the collector (or the other direction in the case of NPN, with negatively charged carriers flowing from emitter to collector). This mode corresponds to a logical \"on\", or a closed switch.\n;Cut-off: In cut-off, biasing conditions opposite of saturation (both junctions reverse biased) are present. There is very little current, which corresponds to a logical \"off\", or an open switch.\n;[[Avalanche breakdown]] region:\n\n[[File:Current-Voltage relationship of BJT.png|thumb|458x458px|The relationship between <math>I_C</math>, <math>U_{CE}</math> and <math>I_B</math>]]\n\nThe modes of operation can be described in terms of the applied voltages (this description applies to NPN transistors; polarities are reversed for PNP transistors):\n\n;Forward-active: Base higher than emitter, collector higher than base (in this mode the collector current is proportional to base current by <math>\\beta_F</math>).\n;Saturation: Base higher than emitter, but collector is not higher than base.\n;Cut-off: Base lower than emitter, but collector is higher than base. It means the transistor is not letting conventional current go through from collector to emitter.\n;Reverse-active: Base lower than emitter, collector lower than base: reverse conventional current goes through transistor.\n\nIn terms of junction biasing: (''reverse biased base\u2013collector junction'' means V{{sub|bc}} &lt; 0 for NPN, opposite for PNP)\n\nAlthough these regions are well defined for sufficiently large applied voltage, they overlap somewhat for small (less than a few hundred millivolts) biases. For example, in the typical grounded-emitter configuration of an NPN BJT used as a pulldown switch in digital logic, the \"off\" state never involves a reverse-biased junction because the base voltage never goes below ground; nevertheless the forward bias is close enough to zero that essentially no current flows, so this end of the forward active region can be regarded as the cutoff region.\n\n===Active-mode NPN transistors in circuits===\n[[File:NPN BJT - Structure & circuit.svg|frame|right|Structure and use of NPN transistor. Arrow according to schematic.]]\nThe diagram shows a schematic representation of an NPN transistor connected to two voltage sources.  To make the transistor conduct appreciable current (on the order of 1&nbsp;mA) from C to E, ''V''<sub>BE</sub> must be above a minimum value sometimes referred to as the '''cut-in voltage'''. The cut-in voltage is usually about 650&nbsp;mV for silicon BJTs at [[room temperature]] but can be different depending on the type of transistor and its [[biasing (electronics)|biasing]]. This applied voltage causes the lower P-N junction to 'turn on', allowing a flow of electrons from the emitter into the base. In active mode, the electric field existing between base and collector (caused by ''V''<sub>CE</sub>) will cause the majority of these electrons to cross the upper P-N junction into the collector to form the collector current ''I''<sub>C</sub>. The remainder of the electrons recombine with holes, the majority carriers in the base, making a current through the base connection to form the base current, ''I''<sub>B</sub>.

A PNP BJT will function like two diodes that share an N-type cathode region, and the NPN like two diodes sharing a P-type anode region.  Connecting two diodes with wires will not make a transistor, since minority carriers will not be able to get from one P\u2013N junction to the other through the wire.\n\nBoth types of BJT function by letting a small current input to the base control an amplified output from the collector. The result is that the transistor makes a good switch that is controlled by its base input. The BJT also makes a good amplifier, since it can multiply a weak input signal to about 100 times its original strength. Networks of transistors are used to make powerful amplifiers with many different applications. In the discussion below, focus is on the NPN bipolar transistor. In the NPN transistor in what is called active mode, the base\u2013emitter voltage <math>V_{\\text{BE}}</math> and collector\u2013base voltage <math>V_{\\text{CB}}</math> are positive, forward biasing the emitter\u2013base junction and reverse-biasing the collector\u2013base junction. In the active mode of operation, electrons are injected from the forward biased n-type emitter region into the p-type base where they diffuse as minority carriers to the reverse-biased n-type collector and are swept away by the electric field in the reverse-biased collector\u2013base junction. For a figure describing forward and reverse bias, see [[Diode#Semiconductor diodes|semiconductor diodes]].\n\n===Large-signal models===\nIn 1954, [[Jewell James Ebers]] and [[John L.

Hashed regions are [[depletion width|depleted regions]].]]\n{{Main article|Early Effect}}\n\nAs the collector\u2013base voltage (<math>V_{\\text{CB}}=V_{\\text{CE}}-V_{\\text{BE}}</math>) varies, the collector\u2013base depletion region varies in size. An increase in the collector\u2013base voltage, for example, causes a greater reverse bias across the collector\u2013base junction, increasing the collector\u2013base depletion region width, and decreasing the width of the base. This variation in base width often is called the \"[[Early effect]]\" after its discoverer [[James M. Early]].\n\nNarrowing of the base width has two consequences:\n* There is a lesser chance for recombination within the \"smaller\" base region.\n* The charge gradient is increased across the base, and consequently, the current of minority carriers injected across the emitter junction increases.\n\nBoth factors increase the collector or \"output\" current of the transistor in response to an increase in the collector\u2013base voltage.\n\nIn the [[bipolar junction transistor#Regions of operation|forward-active region]], the Early effect modifies the collector current (<math>i_\\text{C}</math>) and the forward common emitter current gain (<math>\\beta_F</math>) as given by:{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  i_\\text{C} &= I_\\text{S} \\, e^\\frac{v_\\text{BE}}{V_\\text{T}} \\left(1 + \\frac{V_\\text{CE}}{V_\\text{A}}\\right) \\\\\n     \\beta_F &= \\beta_{F0} \\left(1 + \\frac{V_\\text{CB}}{V_\\text{A}}\\right) \\\\\n  r_\\text{o} &= \\frac{V_\\text{A}}{I_\\text{C}}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere:\n* <math>V_\\text{CE}</math> is the collector\u2013emitter voltage\n* <math>V_\\text{A}</math> is the Early voltage (15 V to 150 V)\n* <math>\\beta_{F0}</math> is forward common-emitter current gain when <math>V_\\text{CB}</math> = 0 V\n* <math>r_\\text{o}</math> is the output impedance\n* <math>I_\\text{C}</math> is the collector current\n\n=====Punchthrough=====\nWhen the base\u2013collector voltage reaches a certain (device-specific) value, the base\u2013collector depletion region boundary meets the base\u2013emitter depletion region boundary. When in this state the transistor effectively has no base. The device thus loses all gain when in this state.\n\n====Gummel\u2013Poon charge-control model====\nThe [[Gummel\u2013Poon model]]<ref>H.

Sometimes it is also called ''Giacoletto model'' because it was introduced by [[Lawrence J. Giacoletto|L.J. Giacoletto]] in 1969. The model can be quite accurate for low-frequency circuits and can easily be adapted for higher-frequency circuits with the addition of appropriate inter-electrode [[capacitance]]s and other parasitic elements.\n{{clear}}\n\n====h-parameter model====\n[[File:BJT h-parameters (generalised).svg|frame|Generalized h-parameter model of an NPN BJT.<br />''Replace '''x''' with '''e''', '''b''' or '''c''' for CE, CB and CC topologies respectively.'']]\nAnother model commonly used to analyze BJT circuits is the ''[[two-port network#Hybrid parameters (h-parameters)|h-parameter]]'' model, closely related to the [[hybrid-pi model]] and the [[admittance parameters|y-parameter]] [[two-port network#Y-parameters (admittance parameters)|two-port]], but using input current and output voltage as independent variables, rather than input and output voltages. This two-port network is particularly suited to BJTs as it lends itself easily to the analysis of circuit behaviour, and may be used to develop further accurate models. As shown, the term, ''x'', in the model represents a different BJT lead depending on the topology used. For common-emitter mode the various symbols take on the specific values as:\n* Terminal 1, base\n* Terminal 2, collector\n* Terminal 3 (common), emitter; giving ''x'' to be ''e''\n* ''i''<sub>i</sub>, base current (''i''<sub>b</sub>)\n* ''i''<sub>o</sub>, collector current (''i''<sub>c</sub>)\n* ''V''<sub>in</sub>, base-to-emitter voltage (''V''<sub>BE</sub>)\n* ''V''<sub>o</sub>, collector-to-emitter voltage (''V''<sub>CE</sub>)\n\nand the h-parameters are given by:\n* ''h''<sub>ix</sub> = ''h''<sub>ie</sub>, the input impedance of the transistor (corresponding to the base resistance ''r''<sub>pi</sub>).\n* ''h''<sub>rx</sub> = ''h''<sub>re</sub>, represents the dependence of the transistor's ''I''<sub>B</sub>&ndash;''V''<sub>BE</sub> curve on the value of ''V''<sub>CE</sub>. It is usually very small and is often neglected (assumed to be zero).\n* ''h''<sub>fx</sub> = ''h''<sub>fe</sub>, the current-gain of the transistor. This parameter is often specified as ''h''<sub>FE</sub> or the DC current-gain (''\u03b2''<sub>DC</sub>) in datasheets.\n* ''h''<sub>ox</sub> = 1/''h''<sub>oe</sub>, the output impedance of transistor. The parameter ''h''<sub>oe</sub> usually corresponds to the output admittance of the bipolar transistor and has to be inverted to convert it to an impedance.\n\nAs shown, the h-parameters have lower-case subscripts and hence signify AC conditions or analyses. For DC conditions they are specified in upper-case. For the CE topology, an approximate h-parameter model is commonly used which further simplifies the circuit analysis. For this the ''h''<sub>oe</sub> and ''h''<sub>re</sub> parameters are neglected (that is, they are set to infinity and zero, respectively). The h-parameter model as shown is suited to low-frequency, small-signal analysis. For high-frequency analyses the inter-electrode capacitances that are important at high frequencies must be added.\n\n=====Etymology of h<sub>FE</sub>=====\nThe ''h'' refers to its being an h-parameter, a set of parameters named for their origin in a ''hybrid equivalent circuit'' model. ''F'' is from ''forward current amplification'' also called the current gain. ''E'' refers to the transistor operating in a ''common emitter'' (CE) configuration. Capital letters used in the subscript indicate that h<sub>FE</sub> refers to a direct current circuit.\n\n=== Industry models ===\n{{expand section|date=January 2015}}\nThe Gummel\u2013Poon SPICE model is often used, but it suffers from several limitations.

It is this gain that allows BJTs to be used as the building blocks of electronic amplifiers. The three main BJT amplifier topologies are:\n* [[Common emitter]]\n* [[Common base]]\n* [[Common collector]]\n\n===Temperature sensors===\n{{Main article|Silicon bandgap temperature sensor}}\nBecause of the known temperature and current dependence of the forward-biased base\u2013emitter junction voltage, the BJT can be used to measure temperature by subtracting two voltages at two different bias currents in a known ratio.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/appnote_number/689 | title=IC Temperature Sensors Find the Hot Spots - Application Note - Maxim | date=February 21, 2002 | website=maxim-ic.com | access-date=August 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Logarithmic converters===\nBecause base\u2013emitter voltage varies as the logarithm of the base\u2013emitter and collector\u2013emitter currents, a BJT can also be used to compute [[logarithm]]s and anti-logarithms. A diode can also perform these nonlinear functions but the transistor provides more circuit flexibility.\n\n==Vulnerabilities==\nExposure of the transistor to [[ionizing radiation]] causes [[radiation hardening|radiation damage]]. Radiation causes a buildup of 'defects' in the base region that act as [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombination centers]]. The resulting reduction in minority carrier lifetime causes gradual loss of gain of the transistor.\n\nPower BJTs are subject to a failure mode called [[secondary breakdown]], in which excessive current and normal imperfections in the silicon die cause portions of the silicon inside the device to become disproportionately hotter than the others. The electrical resistivity of doped silicon, like other semiconductors, has a negative [[temperature coefficient]], meaning that it conducts more current at higher temperatures. Thus, the hottest part of the die conducts the most current, causing its conductivity to increase, which then causes it to become progressively hotter again, until the device fails internally. The [[thermal runaway]] process associated with secondary breakdown, once triggered, occurs almost instantly and may catastrophically damage the transistor package.\n\nIf the emitter-base junction is reverse biased into [[avalanche breakdown|avalanche]] or [[Zener breakdown|Zener]] mode and charge flows for a short period of time, the current gain of the BJT will be permanently degraded.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Bipolar transistor biasing]]\n* [[Gummel plot]]\n* [[Technology CAD]] (TCAD)\n* [[KT315]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note|liststyle=lower-roman}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Bipolar junction transistors}}\n{{external links|section|date=July 2012}}\n* [http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece110/Various/simulation/bjt/ Simulation of a BJT in the Common Emitter Circuit]\n* [http://www.faqs.org/docs/electric/Semi/SEMI_4.html Lessons In Electric Circuits{{spaced ndash}} Bipolar Junction Transistors] (Note: this site shows current as a flow of electrons, rather than the [[conventional current|convention of showing it as a flow of holes]])\n* [http://encyclobeamia.solarbotics.net/articles/bip_junct_trans.html EncycloBEAMia{{spaced ndash}} Bipolar Junction Transistor]\n* [http://www.st-and.ac.uk/~www_pa/Scots_Guide/info/comp/active/BiPolar/bpcur.html Characteristic curves]\n* [http://ux.brookdalecc.edu/fac/engtech/andy/engi242/bjt_models.pdf ENGI 242/ELEC 222: BJT Small Signal Models]\n* [http://semiconductormuseum.com/HistoricTransistorTimeline_Index.htm Transistor Museum, Historic Transistor Timeline]\n* [http://www.tedpavlic.com/teaching/osu/ece327/lab1_bjt/lab1_bjt_transistor_basics.pdf ECE 327: Transistor Basics] \u2013 Summarizes simple Ebers&ndash;Moll model of a bipolar transistor and gives several common BJT circuits.\n* [http://www.tedpavlic.com/teaching/osu/ece327/lab7_proj/lab7_proj_procedure.pdf ECE 327: Procedures for Output Filtering Lab] \u2013 Section 4 (\"Power Amplifier\") discusses design of a BJT-Sziklai-pair-based class-AB current driver in detail.\n* [http://nanohub.org/resources/5083 BJT Operation description] for undergraduate and first year graduate students to describe the basic principles of operation of Bipolar Junction Transistor.\n\n{{Transistor amplifiers}}\n{{Electronic components}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bipolar Junction Transistor}}\n[[Category:Transistor modeling]]\n[[Category:Transistor types]]\n[[Category:Bipolar transistors| ]]"}]}}}}
