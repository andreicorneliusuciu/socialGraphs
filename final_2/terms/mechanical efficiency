Efficiency is measured as a ratio of the measured performance to the performance of an [[ideal machine]]:\n:<math>\\text{Efficiency} = \\frac{\\text{Measured performance}}{\\text{Ideal performance}}</math>\n\n:<math>\\text{Efficiency} = \\frac{\\text{Mechanical Advantage      \u00d7  100}}{\\text{Velocity Ratio}}</math>\nBecause the power [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] system or [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]] does not generate power, its ideal performance occurs when the output power equals the input power, that is, when there are no losses. Real devices dissipate power through friction, part deformation and wear.\n\nThe ideal transmission or mechanism has an efficiency of 100%, because there is no power loss. Real devices will have efficiencies less than 100% because rigid and frictionless systems do not exist. The power losses in a transmission or mechanism are eventually dissipated as [[thermal energy|heat]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mechanical advantage]]\n* [[Thermal efficiency]]\n* [[Electrical efficiency]]\n* [[Internal combustion engine]]\n* [[Electric motor]]\n* [[Velocity ratio]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Mechanical engineering]]\n[[Category:Machines]]\n[[Category:Kinematics]]\n[[Category:Mechanisms (engineering)]]\n\n\n\n[[he:\u05e0\u05e6\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea \u05de\u05db\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea]]"}]}}}}
