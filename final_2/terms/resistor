The component is cut from the tape during assembly and the part is inserted into the board.]]\n\nA ''' resistor''' is a [[passivity (engineering)|passive]] [[terminal (electronics)|two-terminal]] [[electronic component|electrical component]] that implements [[electrical resistance]] as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, [[Biasing|bias]] active elements, and terminate [[transmission line]]s, among other uses. High-power resistors that can dissipate many [[watt]]s of electrical power as heat may be used as part of motor controls, in power distribution systems, or as test loads for [[electric generator|generators]]. \nFixed resistors have resistances that only change slightly with temperature, time or operating voltage. Variable resistors can be used to adjust circuit elements (such as a volume control or a lamp dimmer), or as sensing devices for heat, light, humidity, force, or chemical activity.\n\nResistors are common elements of [[electrical network]]s and [[electronic circuit]]s and are ubiquitous in [[Electronics|electronic equipment]].  Practical resistors as discrete components can be composed of various compounds and forms. Resistors are also implemented within [[integrated circuits]].\n\nThe electrical function of a resistor is specified by its resistance: common commercial resistors are manufactured over a range of more than nine [[orders of magnitude]]. The nominal value of the resistance falls within the [[Engineering tolerance#Electrical component tolerance|manufacturing tolerance]], indicated on the component.\n\n==Electronic symbols and notation==\n{{Main|Electronic symbol}}\n\nTwo typical [[schematic diagram]] symbols are as follows:\n<gallery>\nFile:Resistor, Rheostat (variable resistor), and Potentiometer symbols.svg| (a)&nbsp;resistor, (b)&nbsp;rheostat (variable resistor), and (c)&nbsp;potentiometer\nFile:Resistor_symbol_IEC.svg|[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] resistor symbol\n</gallery>\n\nThe notation to state a resistor's value in a circuit diagram varies. The European notation [[BS 1852]] avoids using a [[decimal separator]], and replaces the decimal separator with the SI prefix symbol for the particular value. For example, ''8k2'' in a circuit diagram indicates a resistor value of 8.2&nbsp;k\u03a9. Additional zeros imply tighter tolerance, for example ''15M0''. When the value can be expressed without the need for an SI prefix, an \"R\" is used instead of the decimal separator. For example, ''1R2'' indicates 1.2&nbsp;\u03a9, and ''18R'' indicates 18&nbsp;\u03a9. The use of a SI prefix symbol or the letter \"R\" circumvents the problem that decimal separators tend to \"disappear\" when [[photocopy]]ing a printed circuit diagram.\n\n==Theory of operation==\n[[File:ResistanceHydraulicAnalogy2.svg|thumb|400px|right|The [[hydraulic analogy]] compares electric current flowing through circuits to water flowing through pipes. When a pipe (left) is clogged with hair (right), it takes a larger pressure to achieve the same flow of water. Pushing electric current through a large resistance is like pushing water through a pipe clogged with hair: It requires a larger push ([[voltage]]) to drive the same flow ([[electric current]]).<ref>{{cite web|author=Harder, Douglas Wilhelm |title=Resistors: A Motor with a Constant Force (Force Source)|url=https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~dwharder/Analogy/Resistors/|publisher=Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref>]]\n\n===Ohm's law===\n{{Main|Ohm's law}}\n\nThe behaviour of an ideal resistor is dictated by the relationship specified by [[Ohm's law]]:\n\n:<math>V=I \\cdot R.</math>\n\nOhm's law states that the voltage (V) across a resistor is proportional to the current (I), where the constant of proportionality is the resistance (R). For example, if a 300 [[ohm]] resistor is attached across the terminals of a 12 volt battery, then a current of 12 / 300 = 0.04 [[ampere]]s flows through that resistor.\n\nPractical resistors also have some [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]] which affect the relation between voltage and current in [[alternating current]] circuits.\n\nThe [[Ohm (unit)|ohm]] (symbol: [[\u03a9]]) is the [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of [[electrical resistance]], named after [[Georg Simon Ohm]]. An ohm is equivalent to a [[volt]] per [[ampere]]. Since resistors are specified and manufactured over a very large range of values, the derived units of milliohm (1 m\u03a9 = 10<sup>\u22123</sup> \u03a9), kilohm (1 k\u03a9 = 10<sup>3</sup> \u03a9), and megohm (1 M\u03a9 = 10<sup>6</sup> \u03a9) are also in common usage.\n\n===Series and parallel resistors===\n{{Main|Series and parallel circuits}}\n\n{{anchor|series|Series}}<!-- do not delete, used by redirects -->\n\nThe total resistance of resistors connected in series is the sum of their individual resistance values. \n:[[File:resistors in series.svg|A diagram of several resistors, connected end to end, with the same amount of current going through each]]\n:<math>\nR_\\mathrm{eq} = R_1  + R_2 + \\cdots + R_n.\n</math>\n{{anchor|parallel|Parallel}}<!-- do not delete, used by redirects -->\nThe total resistance of resistors connected in parallel is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistors. \n:[[File:resistors in parallel.svg|A diagram of several resistors, side by side, both leads of each connected to the same wires]]\n:<math>\n\\frac{1}{R_\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\cdots +  \\frac{1}{R_n}.\n</math>\n\nFor example, a 10 ohm resistor connected in parallel with a 5 ohm resistor and a 15 ohm resistor produces {{sfrac|1/10 + 1/5 + 1/15}} ohms of resistance, or {{sfrac|30|11}} = 2.727 ohms.\n\nA resistor network that is a combination of parallel and series connections can be broken up into smaller parts that are either one or the other. Some complex networks of resistors cannot be resolved in this manner, requiring more sophisticated circuit analysis. Generally, the [[Y-\u0394 transform]], or [[Equivalent impedance transforms#2-terminal, n-element, 3-element-kind networks|matrix methods]] can be used to solve such problems.<ref>Farago, PS, ''An Introduction to Linear Network Analysis'', pp. 18\u201321, The English Universities Press Ltd, 1961.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0305-4470/37/26/004|title=Theory of resistor networks: The two-point resistance|year=2004|author=Wu, F.

Using [[Ohm's law]], the two other forms can be derived. This power is converted into heat which must be dissipated by the resistor's package before its temperature rises excessively.\n\nResistors are rated according to their maximum power dissipation.  Discrete resistors in solid-state electronic systems are typically rated as 1/10, 1/8, or 1/4 watt. They usually absorb much less than a watt of electrical power and require little attention to their power rating.\n\n[[File:Danotherm HS50 power resistor.jpg|thumb|An aluminium-housed power resistor rated for 50 W when heat-sinked]]\nResistors required to dissipate substantial amounts of power, particularly used in power supplies, power conversion circuits, and power amplifiers, are generally referred to as ''power resistors''; this designation is loosely applied to resistors with power ratings of 1 watt or greater. Power resistors are physically larger and may not use the preferred values, color codes, and external packages described below.\n\nIf the average power dissipated by a resistor is more than its power rating, damage to the resistor may occur, permanently altering its resistance; this is distinct from the reversible change in resistance due to its [[temperature coefficient]] when it warms. Excessive power dissipation may raise the temperature of the resistor to a point where it can burn the circuit board or adjacent components, or even cause a fire. There are flameproof resistors that fail (open circuit) before they overheat dangerously.\n\nSince poor air circulation, high altitude, or high [[operating temperature]]s may occur, resistors may be specified with higher rated dissipation than is experienced in service.\n\nAll resistors have a maximum voltage rating; this may limit the power dissipation for higher resistance values.\n\n[[File:USSR power resistor VZR 12W.JPG|thumb| VZR power resistor 1.5k\u03a9 12W, manufactured in 1963 in the Soviet Union]]\n\n== Nonideal properties ==\nPractical resistors have a series [[inductance]] and a small parallel [[capacitance]]; these specifications can be important in high-frequency applications. In a [[low-noise amplifier]] or [[pre-amp]], the [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] characteristics of a resistor may be an issue.\n\nThe [[temperature coefficient]] of the resistance may also be of concern in some precision applications.\n\nThe unwanted inductance, excess noise, and temperature coefficient are mainly dependent on the technology used in manufacturing the resistor. They are not normally specified individually for a particular family of resistors manufactured using a particular technology.<ref>A family of resistors may also be characterized according to its ''critical resistance.'' Applying a constant voltage across resistors in that family below the critical resistance will exceed the maximum power rating first; resistances larger than the critical resistance fail first from exceeding the maximum voltage rating. See {{cite book |author=Middleton, Wendy |author2=Van Valkenburg, Mac E. |title=Reference data for engineers: radio, electronics, computer, and communications |edition=9 |publisher=Newnes |year=2002 |isbn=0-7506-7291-9 |pages=5\u201310}}</ref> A family of discrete resistors is also characterized according to its form factor, that is, the size of the device and the position of its leads (or terminals) which is relevant in the practical manufacturing of circuits using them.\n\nPractical resistors are also specified as having a maximum [[Power (physics)|power]] rating which must exceed the anticipated power dissipation of that resistor in a particular circuit: this is mainly of concern in power electronics applications.\nResistors with higher power ratings are physically larger and may require [[heat sink]]s. In a high-voltage circuit, attention must sometimes be paid to the rated maximum working voltage of the resistor. While there is no minimum working voltage for a given resistor, failure to account for a resistor's maximum rating may cause the resistor to incinerate when current is run through it.\n\n==Fixed resistor==\n[[File:Sil resistor.png|thumb|A single in line (SIL) resistor package with 8 individual, 47 ohm resistors. One end of each resistor is connected to a separate pin and the other ends are all connected together to the remaining (common) pin \u2013 pin 1, at the end identified by the white dot.]]\n\n===Lead arrangements===\n[[File:3 Resistors.jpg|thumb|right| Resistors with wire leads for through-hole mounting]]\n[[Through-hole]] components typically have \"leads\" (pronounced \\\u02c8l\u0113dz\\) leaving the body \"axially,\" that is, on a line parallel with the part's longest axis. Others have leads coming off their body \"radially\" instead. Other components may be [[Surface-mount technology|SMT]] (surface mount technology), while high power resistors may have one of their leads designed into the [[heat sink]].\n\n===Carbon composition===\n[[File:Old Radio Resistors.jpg|thumb|Three carbon composition resistors in a 1960s [[Vacuum tube|valve]] (vacuum tube) radio]]\nCarbon composition resistors consist of a solid cylindrical resistive element with embedded wire leads or metal end caps to which the lead wires are attached. The body of the resistor is protected with paint or plastic. Early 20th-century carbon composition resistors had uninsulated bodies; the lead wires were wrapped around the ends of the resistance element rod and soldered. The completed resistor was painted for [[Electronic_color_code#Resistor_color-coding|color-coding]] of its value.\n\nThe resistive element is made from a mixture of finely powdered carbon and an insulating material, usually ceramic.  A resin holds the mixture together.  The resistance is determined by the ratio of the fill material (the powdered ceramic) to the carbon.  Higher concentrations of carbon, which is a good conductor, result in lower resistance. Carbon composition resistors were commonly used in the 1960s and earlier, but are not popular for general use now as other types have better specifications, such as tolerance, voltage dependence, and stress. Carbon composition resistors change value when stressed with over-voltages. Moreover, if internal moisture content, from exposure for some length of time to a humid environment, is significant, soldering heat creates a non-reversible change in resistance value.  Carbon composition resistors have poor stability with time and were consequently factory sorted to, at best, only 5% tolerance.<ref>Harter, James H. and Lin, Paul Y.

[http://www.element-14.com/community/docs/DOC-22086 ''Basics of Linear Fixed Resistors Application Note''], Document Number 28771.</ref>\n\nCarbon composition resistors are still available, but comparatively quite costly. Values ranged from fractions of an ohm to 22 megohms. Due to their high price, these resistors are no longer used in most applications.  However, they are used in power supplies and welding controls.<ref name=Vishay08/>\n\n===Carbon pile===\nA carbon pile resistor is made of a stack of carbon disks compressed between two metal contact plates. Adjusting the clamping pressure changes the resistance between the plates. These resistors are used when an adjustable load is required, for example in testing automotive batteries or radio transmitters. A carbon pile resistor can also be used as a speed control for small motors in household appliances (sewing machines, hand-held mixers) with ratings up to a few hundred watts.<ref>Morris, C. G.

Varying shapes, coupled with the [[resistivity]] of [[amorphous]] carbon (ranging from 500 to 800&nbsp;\u03bc\u03a9&nbsp;m), can provide a wide range of resistance values. Compared to carbon composition they feature low noise, because of the precise distribution of the pure graphite without binding.<ref>{{cite web|title=Carbon Film Resistor|url=http://www.resistorguide.com/carbon-film-resistor/|work= The Resistorguide|accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref> Carbon film resistors feature a power rating range of 0.125&nbsp;W to&nbsp;5 W at 70&nbsp;\u00b0C. Resistances available range from 1 ohm to 10 megohm. The carbon film resistor has an [[operating temperature]] range of \u221255&nbsp;\u00b0C to 155&nbsp;\u00b0C. It has 200 to 600 volts maximum working voltage range.  Special carbon film resistors are used in applications requiring high pulse stability.<ref name=Vishay08/>\n\n===Printed carbon resistor===\n[[File:PCB Carbon Printed Resistor.jpg|thumb|A carbon resistor printed directly onto the SMD pads on a PCB. Inside a 1989 vintage Psion II Organiser]]\n\nCarbon composition resistors can be printed directly onto printed circuit board (PCB) substrates as part of the PCB manufacturing process. Although this technique is more common on hybrid PCB modules, it can also be used on standard fibreglass PCBs. Tolerances are typically quite large, and can be in the order of 30%. A typical application would be non-critical [[pull-up resistor]]s.\n\n===Thick and thin film===\n[[File:Laser Trimmed Precision Thin Film Resistor Network.JPG|thumb|Laser Trimmed Precision Thin Film Resistor Network from Fluke, used in the Keithley DMM7510 multimeter. Ceramic backed with glass hermetic seal cover.]]\nThick film resistors became popular during the 1970s, and most [[surface-mount technology|SMD]] (surface mount device) resistors today are of this type. The resistive element of thick films is 1000 times thicker than thin films,<ref name=\"Film Comparison\">{{cite web|title=Thick Film and Thin Film|url=http://www.digikey.com/Web%20Export/Supplier%20Content/Stackpole_738/PDF/Stackpole_ThickFilmXThinFilm.pdf|publisher=Digi-Key (SEI)|accessdate=23 July 2011}}</ref> but the principal difference is how the film is applied to the cylinder (axial resistors) or the surface (SMD resistors).\n\nThin film resistors are made by [[sputtering]] (a method of [[vacuum deposition]]) the resistive material onto an insulating substrate.  The film is then etched in a similar manner to the old (subtractive) process for making printed circuit boards; that is, the surface is coated with a [[photoresist|photo-sensitive material]], then covered by a pattern film, irradiated with [[ultraviolet]] light, and then the exposed photo-sensitive coating is developed, and underlying thin film is etched away.\n\nThick film resistors are manufactured using screen and stencil printing processes.<ref name=Vishay08/>\n\nBecause the time during which the sputtering is performed can be controlled, the thickness of the thin film can be accurately controlled. The type of material is also usually different consisting of one or more ceramic ([[cermet]]) conductors such as [[tantalum nitride]] (TaN), [[Ruthenium(IV) oxide|ruthenium oxide]] ({{chem|RuO|2}}), [[Lead(II) oxide|lead oxide]] (PbO), [[bismuth ruthenate]] ({{chem|Bi|2|Ru|2|O|7}}), [[chromel|nickel chromium]] (NiCr), or [[bismuth iridate]] ({{chem|Bi|2|Ir|2|O|7}}).\n\nThe resistance of both thin and thick film resistors after manufacture is not highly accurate; they are usually trimmed to an accurate value by abrasive or [[laser trimming]]. Thin film resistors are usually specified with tolerances of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, or 1%, and with temperature coefficients of 5 to 25 [[Temperature coefficient|ppm/K]].  They also have much lower [[Resistor noise|noise]] levels, on the level of 10\u2013100 times less than thick film resistors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThick film resistors may use the same conductive ceramics, but they are mixed with [[sintered]] (powdered) glass and a carrier liquid so that the composite can be [[screen-printing|screen-printed]].  This composite of glass and conductive ceramic (cermet) material is then fused (baked) in an oven at about 850&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nThick film resistors, when first manufactured, had tolerances of 5%, but standard tolerances have improved to 2% or 1% in the last few decades. Temperature coefficients of thick film resistors are high, typically \u00b1200 or \u00b1250 ppm/K; a 40 [[kelvin]] (70&nbsp;\u00b0F) temperature change can change the resistance by 1%.\n\nThin film resistors are usually far more expensive than thick film resistors. For example, SMD thin film resistors, with 0.5% tolerances, and with 25 ppm/K temperature coefficients, when bought in full size reel quantities, are about twice the cost of 1%, 250 ppm/K thick film resistors.\n\n===Metal film===\nA common type of axial-leaded resistor today is the metal-film resistor. Metal Electrode Leadless Face ([[MELF Electronic Components|MELF]]) resistors often use the same technology, and are also cylindrically shaped but are designed for surface mounting. Note that other types of resistors (e.g., carbon composition) are also available in MELF packages.\n\nMetal film resistors are usually coated with nickel chromium (NiCr), but might be coated with any of the cermet materials listed above for thin film resistors. Unlike thin film resistors, the material may be applied using different techniques than sputtering (though this is one of the techniques).  Also, unlike thin-film resistors, the resistance value is determined by cutting a helix through the coating rather than by etching.  (This is similar to the way carbon resistors are made.) The result is a reasonable tolerance (0.5%, 1%, or 2%) and a temperature coefficient that is generally between 50 and 100 ppm/K.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.kennethkuhn.com/students/ee431/text/ee431lab3.pdf\n| title      = Measuring the Temperature Coefficient of a Resistor\n| accessdate = 2010-03-18\n| author     = Kuhn, Kenneth A.}}</ref> Metal film resistors possess good noise characteristics and low non-linearity due to a low voltage coefficient.  Also beneficial are their tight tolerance, low temperature coefficient and long-term stability.<ref name=Vishay08/>\n\n===Metal oxide film===\nMetal-oxide film resistors are made of metal oxides which results in a higher operating temperature and greater stability/reliability than Metal film. They are used in applications with high endurance demands.\n\n===Wire wound===\n[[File:KTSU resistors.jpg|thumb|right|High-power wire wound resistors used for [[dynamic braking]] on an electric railway car. Such resistors may dissipate many kilowatts for an extended length of time.]]\n[[File:Types of winding by Zureks.png|thumb|Types of windings in wire resistors: {{ordered list |common |[[bifilar winding|bifilar]] |common on a thin former |[[Ayrton-Perry winding|Ayrton-Perry]]}}]]\n\nWirewound resistors are commonly made by winding a metal wire, usually [[nichrome]], around a ceramic, plastic, or fiberglass core. The ends of the wire are soldered or welded to two caps or rings, attached to the ends of the core. The assembly is protected with a layer of paint, molded plastic, or an [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] coating baked at high temperature. These resistors are designed to withstand unusually high temperatures of up to 450&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=Vishay08/> Wire leads in low power wirewound resistors are usually between 0.6 and 0.8&nbsp;mm in diameter and tinned for ease of soldering. For higher power wirewound resistors, either a ceramic outer case or an aluminum outer case on top of an insulating layer is used \u2013 if the outer case is ceramic, such resistors are sometimes described as \"cement\" resistors, though they do not actually contain any traditional [[Portland cement|cement]]. The aluminum-cased types are designed to be attached to a heat sink to dissipate the heat; the rated power is dependent on being used with a suitable heat sink, e.g., a 50 W power rated resistor overheats at a fraction of the power dissipation if not used with a heat sink. Large wirewound resistors may be rated for 1,000 watts or more.\n\nBecause wirewound resistors are [[Electromagnetic coil|coils]] they have more undesirable [[Electromagnetic induction|inductance]] than other types of resistor, although winding the wire in sections with alternately reversed direction can minimize inductance. Other techniques employ [[bifilar winding]], or a flat thin former (to reduce cross-section area of the coil). For the most demanding circuits, resistors with [[Ayrton-Perry winding]] are used.\n\nApplications of wirewound resistors are similar to those of composition resistors with the exception of the high frequency.  The high frequency response of wirewound resistors is substantially worse than that of a composition resistor.<ref name=Vishay08/>\n\n===Foil resistor===\nThe primary resistance element of a foil resistor is a special alloy foil several [[micrometre|micrometers]] thick. Since their introduction in the 1960s, foil resistors have had the best precision and stability of any resistor available. One of the important parameters influencing stability is the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR). The TCR of foil resistors is extremely low, and has been further improved over the years.\nOne range of ultra-precision foil resistors offers a TCR of 0.14&nbsp;ppm/\u00b0C, tolerance \u00b10.005%, long-term stability (1 year) 25&nbsp;ppm, (3 years) 50&nbsp;ppm (further improved 5-fold by hermetic sealing), stability under load (2000 hours) 0.03%, thermal EMF 0.1&nbsp;\u03bcV/\u00b0C, noise \u221242&nbsp;dB, voltage coefficient 0.1&nbsp;ppm/V, inductance 0.08&nbsp;\u03bcH, capacitance 0.5&nbsp;pF.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alpha-elec.co.jp/e_machine.html |title=Alpha Electronics Corp. Metal Foil Resistors |publisher=Alpha-elec.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref>\n\n===Ammeter shunts===\nAn [[Shunt (electrical)#Use in current measuring|ammeter shunt]] is a special type of current-sensing resistor, having four terminals and a value in milliohms or even micro-ohms. Current-measuring instruments, by themselves, can usually accept only limited currents. To measure high currents, the current passes through the shunt across which the voltage drop is measured and interpreted as current. A typical shunt consists of two solid metal blocks, sometimes brass, mounted on an insulating base. Between the blocks, and soldered or brazed to them, are one or more strips of low [[Temperature coefficient of resistivity|temperature coefficient of resistance]] (TCR) [[manganin]] alloy. Large bolts threaded into the blocks make the current connections, while much smaller screws provide volt meter connections. Shunts are rated by full-scale current, and often have a voltage drop of 50 mV at rated current. Such meters are adapted to the shunt full current rating by using an appropriately marked dial face; no change need to be made to the other parts of the meter.\n\n===Grid resistor===\nIn heavy-duty industrial high-current applications, a grid resistor is a large convection-cooled lattice of stamped metal alloy strips connected in rows between two electrodes. Such industrial grade resistors can be as large as a refrigerator; some designs can handle over 500 amperes of current, with a range of resistances extending lower than 0.04 ohms. They are used in applications such as [[dynamic braking]] and [[Load bank#Resistive load bank|load banking]] for [[Diesel locomotive|locomotives]] and trams, neutral grounding for industrial AC distribution, control loads for cranes and heavy equipment, load testing of generators and harmonic filtering for electric substations.<ref>[http://www.milwaukeeresistor.com/gridresistors.html Milwaukee Resistor Corporation.

Some wirewound power resistors have a tapping point that can slide along the resistance element, allowing a larger or smaller part of the resistance to be used.\n\nWhere continuous adjustment of the resistance value during operation of equipment is required, the sliding resistance tap can be connected to a knob accessible to an operator. Such a device is called a [[rheostat]] and has two terminals.\n\n===Potentiometers===\n\n[[File:Potentiometer 1.jpg|thumb|Typical panel mount potentiometer]]\n[[File:Potentiometer cutaway drawing.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Drawing of potentiometer with case cut away, showing parts: (''A'') shaft, (''B'') stationary carbon composition resistance element, (''C'') phosphor bronze wiper, (''D'') shaft attached to wiper, (''E, G'') terminals connected to ends of resistance element, (''F'') terminal connected to wiper.]]\n[[File:12 surface mount potentiometers.jpg|thumb|An assortment of small through-hole potentiometers designed for mounting on [[printed circuit board]]s.]]\n{{Main|Potentiometer}}\n\nA [[potentiometer]] or ''pot'' is a three-terminal resistor with a continuously adjustable tapping point controlled by rotation of a shaft or knob or by a linear slider.<ref name=\"Mazda\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Mazda\n | first1 = F.

An alternate construction is resistance wire wound on a form, with the wiper sliding axially along the coil.<ref name=\"Mazda\" />  These have lower resolution, since as the wiper moves the resistance changes in steps equal to the resistance of a single turn.<ref name=\"Mazda\" />\n\nHigh-resolution multiturn potentiometers are used in a few precision applications.  These have wirewound resistance elements typically wound on a helical mandrel, with the wiper moving on a helical track as the control is turned, making continuous contact with the wire.   Some include a conductive-plastic resistance coating over the wire to improve resolution.  These typically offer ten turns of their shafts to cover their full range. They are usually set with dials that include a simple turns counter and a graduated dial, and can typically achieve three digit resolution.   Electronic analog computers used them in quantity for setting coefficients, and delayed-sweep oscilloscopes of recent decades included one on their panels.\n\n===Resistance decade boxes===\n{{Main article|Decade box}}\n[[File:Odporov\u00e1 dek\u00e1da KURBELWIDERSTAND (A).jpg|thumb|Resistance decade box \"Kurbelwiderstand\", made in former [[East Germany]].]]\nA resistance decade box or resistor substitution box is a unit containing resistors of many values, with one or more mechanical switches which allow any one of various discrete resistances offered by the box to be dialed in. Usually the resistance is accurate to high precision, ranging from laboratory/calibration grade accuracy of 20 parts per million, to field grade at 1%. Inexpensive boxes with lesser accuracy are also available. All types offer a convenient way of selecting and quickly changing a resistance in laboratory, experimental and development work without needing to attach resistors one by one, or even stock each value. The range of resistance provided, the maximum resolution, and the accuracy characterize the box. For example, one box offers resistances from 0 to 100 megohms, maximum resolution 0.1 ohm, accuracy 0.1%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietlabs.com/decaderes.html |title=Decade Box \u2013 Resistance Decade Boxes |publisher=Ietlabs.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref>\n\n===Special devices===\nThere are various devices whose resistance changes with various quantities. The resistance of NTC [[thermistor]]s exhibit a strong negative temperature coefficient, making them useful for measuring temperatures. Since their resistance can be large until they are allowed to heat up due to the passage of current, they are also commonly used to prevent excessive [[Inrush current|current surges]] when equipment is powered on. Similarly, the resistance of a [[humistor]] varies with humidity. One sort of photodetector, the [[photoresistor]], has a resistance which varies with illumination.\n\nThe [[strain gauge]], invented by [[Edward E. Simmons]] and [[Arthur C. Ruge]] in 1938, is a type of resistor that changes value with applied strain. A single resistor may be used, or a pair (half bridge), or four resistors connected in a [[Wheatstone bridge]] configuration. The strain resistor is bonded with adhesive to an object that is subjected to [[Infinitesimal strain theory|mechanical strain]]. With the strain gauge and a filter, amplifier, and analog/digital converter, the strain on an object can be measured.\n\nA related but more recent invention uses a [[Quantum Tunnelling Composite]] to sense mechanical stress. It passes a current whose magnitude can vary by a factor of 10<sup>12</sup> in response to changes in applied pressure.\n\n==Measurement==\nThe value of a resistor can be measured with an [[ohmmeter]], which may be one function of a [[multimeter]]. Usually, probes on the ends of test leads connect to the resistor. A simple ohmmeter may apply a voltage from a battery across the unknown resistor (with an internal resistor of a known value in series) producing a current which drives a [[Galvanometer|meter movement]]. The current, in accordance with [[Ohm's law]], is inversely proportional to the sum of the internal resistance and the resistor being tested, resulting in an analog meter scale which is very non-linear, calibrated from infinity to 0 ohms. A digital multimeter, using active electronics, may instead pass a specified current through the test resistance. The voltage generated across the test resistance in that case is linearly proportional to its resistance, which is measured and displayed. In either case the low-resistance ranges of the meter pass much more current through the test leads than do high-resistance ranges, in order for the voltages present to be at reasonable levels (generally below 10 volts) but still measurable.\n\nMeasuring low-value resistors, such as fractional-ohm resistors, with acceptable accuracy requires [[Four-terminal sensing|four-terminal connections]]. One pair of terminals applies a known, calibrated current to the resistor, while the other pair senses the voltage drop across the resistor. Some laboratory quality ohmmeters, especially milliohmmeters, and even some of the better digital multimeters sense using four input terminals for this purpose, which may be used with special test leads. Each of the two so-called [[Four-terminal sensing|Kelvin clips]] has a pair of jaws insulated from each other.  One side of each clip applies the measuring current, while the other connections are only to sense the voltage drop. The resistance is again calculated using Ohm's Law as the measured voltage divided by the applied current.\n\n==Standards==\n\n===Production resistors===\nResistor characteristics are quantified and reported using various national standards. In the US, MIL-STD-202<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dscc.dla.mil/Downloads/MilSpec/Docs/MIL-STD-202/std202.pdf |title=Test method standard: electronic and electrical component parts |publisher=Department of Defense}}</ref> contains the relevant test methods to which other standards refer.\n\nThere are various standards specifying properties of resistors for use in equipment:\n*[[BS 1852]]\n*EIA-RS-279\n*MIL-PRF-26\n*MIL-PRF-39007 (Fixed Power, established reliability)\n*MIL-PRF-55342 (Surface-mount thick and thin film)\n*MIL-PRF-914\n*MIL-R-11 [http://www.landandmaritime.dla.mil/Programs/MilSpec/ListDocs.aspx?BasicDoc=MIL-R-11 STANDARD CANCELED]\n*MIL-R-39017 (Fixed, General Purpose, Established Reliability)\n*MIL-PRF-32159 (zero ohm jumpers)\n*UL 1412 (fusing and temperature limited resistors)<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080210020811/http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=1412.html Fusing Resistors and Temperature-Limited Resistors for Radio- and Television- Type Appliances UL 1412]. ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com</ref>\n\nThere are other United States military procurement MIL-R- standards.\n\n===Resistance standards===\nThe [[primary standard]] for resistance, the \"mercury ohm\" was initially defined in 1884 in as a column of mercury 106.3&nbsp;cm long and {{nowrap|1 square millimeter}} in cross-section, at {{nowrap|0 degrees Celsius}}. Difficulties in precisely measuring the physical constants to replicate this standard result in variations of as much as 30&nbsp;ppm. From 1900 the mercury ohm was replaced with a precision machined plate of [[manganin]].<ref>[http://nvl.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/sp958-lide/063-065.pdf Stability of Double-Walled Manganin Resistors]. NIST.gov</ref> Since 1990 the international resistance standard has been based on the [[quantum Hall effect|quantized Hall effect]] discovered by [[Von Klitzing|Klaus von Klitzing]], for which he won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1985.<ref>Klaus von Klitzing [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1985/klitzing-lecture.pdf The Quantized Hall Effect]. Nobel lecture, December 9, 1985. nobelprize.org</ref>\n\nResistors of extremely high precision are manufactured for [[calibration]] and [[laboratory]] use. They may have four terminals, using one pair to carry an operating current and the other pair to measure the voltage drop; this eliminates errors caused by voltage drops across the lead resistances, because no charge flows through voltage sensing leads. It is important in small value resistors (100\u20130.0001&nbsp;ohm) where lead resistance is significant or even comparable with respect to resistance standard value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tinsley.co.uk/products/standard-resistors/4737b.htm |title=Standard Resistance Unit Type 4737B |publisher=Tinsley.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref>\n\n==Resistor marking==\n{{Main|Electronic color code}}\n\nMost axial resistors use a pattern of colored stripes to indicate resistance, which also indicate tolerance, and may also be extended to show temperature coefficient and reliability class.  Cases are usually tan, brown, blue, or green, though other colors are occasionally found such as dark red or dark gray. The power rating is not usually marked and is deduced from the size.\n\nThe color bands of the carbon resistors can be three, four, five or, six bands. The first two bands represent first two digits to measure their value in ohms. The third band of a three- or four-banded resistor represents multiplier; a fourth band denotes tolerance (which if absent, denotes \u00b120%). For five and six color-banded resistors, the third band is a third digit, fourth band multiplier and fifth is tolerance. The sixth band represents temperature co-efficient in a six-banded resistor.\n\n[[Surface-mount]] resistors are marked numerically, if they are big enough to permit marking; more-recent small sizes are impractical to mark.\n\nEarly 20th century resistors, essentially uninsulated, were dipped in paint to cover their entire body for color-coding. A second color of paint was applied to one end of the element, and a color dot (or band) in the middle provided the third digit. The rule was \"body, tip, dot\", providing two significant digits for value and the decimal multiplier, in that sequence. Default tolerance was \u00b120%. Closer-tolerance resistors had silver (\u00b110%) or gold-colored (\u00b15%) paint on the other end.\n\n===Preferred values===\n{{See also|Preferred number#E series}}\n\nEarly resistors were made in more or less arbitrary round numbers; a series might have 100, 125, 150, 200, 300, etc. Resistors as manufactured are subject to a certain percentage [[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]], and it makes sense to manufacture values that correlate with the tolerance, so that the actual value of a resistor overlaps slightly with its neighbors. Wider spacing leaves gaps; narrower spacing increases manufacturing and inventory costs to provide resistors that are more or less interchangeable.\n\nA logical scheme is to produce resistors in a range of values which increase in a [[geometric progression]], so that each value is greater than its predecessor by a fixed multiplier or percentage, chosen to match the tolerance of the range. For example, for a tolerance of \u00b120% it makes sense to have each resistor about 1.5 times its predecessor, covering a decade in 6 values. In practice the factor used is 1.4678, giving values of 1.47, 2.15, 3.16, 4.64, 6.81, 10 for the 1\u201310-decade (a decade is a range increasing by a factor of 10; 0.1\u20131 and 10\u2013100 are other examples); these are rounded in practice to 1.5, 2.2, 3.3, 4.7, 6.8, 10; followed, by 15, 22, 33, \u2026 and preceded by \u2026 0.47, 0.68, 1. This scheme has been adopted as the [[E48 series|'''E6''' series]] of the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 60063 [[preferred number]] values. There are also '''E12''', '''E24''', '''E48''', '''E96''' and '''E192''' series for components of progressively finer resolution, with 12, 24, 96, and 192 different values within each decade. The actual values used are in the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 60063 lists of preferred numbers.\n\nA resistor of 100 ohms \u00b120% would be expected to have a value between 80 and 120 ohms; its E6 neighbors are 68 (54\u201382) and 150 (120\u2013180) ohms.  A sensible spacing, E6 is used for \u00b120% components; E12 for \u00b110%; E24 for \u00b15%; E48 for \u00b12%, E96 for \u00b11%; E192 for \u00b10.5% or better. Resistors are manufactured in values from a few milliohms to about a gigaohm in IEC60063 ranges appropriate for their tolerance. Manufacturers may sort resistors into tolerance-classes based on measurement.  Accordingly, a selection of 100 ohms resistors with a tolerance of \u00b110%, might not lie just around 100 ohm (but no more than 10% off) as one would expect (a bell-curve), but rather be in two groups \u2013 either between 5 and 10% too high or 5 to 10% too low (but not closer to 100 ohm than that) because any resistors the factory had measured as being less than 5% off would have been marked and sold as resistors with only \u00b15% tolerance or better.  When designing a circuit, this may become a consideration.  This process of sorting parts based on post-production measurement is known as \"binning\", and can be applied to other components than resistors (such as speed grades for CPUs).\n\nEarlier power wirewound resistors, such as brown vitreous-enameled types, however, were made with a different system of preferred values, such as some of those mentioned in the first sentence of this section.\n\n===SMT resistors===\n[[File:Zero ohm resistors cropped.jpg|thumb|This image shows four surface-mount resistors (the component at the upper left is a [[capacitor]]) including two [[zero-ohm resistor]]s. Zero-ohm links are often used instead of wire links, so that they can be inserted by a resistor-inserting machine. Their resistance is non-zero but negligible. ]]\n\n[[Surface-mount technology|Surface mounted]] resistors of larger sizes (metric [[Surface-mount technology#Packages|1608]] and above) are printed with numerical values in a code related to that used on axial resistors. Standard-tolerance [[surface-mount technology|surface-mount technology (SMT)]] resistors are marked with a three-digit code, in which the first two digits are the first two [[significant digit]]s of the value and the third digit is the power of ten (the number of zeroes). For example:\n\n{|\n|-\n|''334''||= 33 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> ohms = 330 kilohms\n|-\n|''222''||= 22 \u00d7 10<sup>2</sup> ohms = 2.2 kilohms\n|-\n|''473''||= 47 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> ohms = 47 kilohms\n|-\n|''105''||= 10 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> ohms = 1 megohm\n|}\n\nResistances less than 100 ohms are written: 100, 220, 470. The final zero represents ten to the power zero, which is 1. For example:\n\n{|\n|-\n|''100''||= 10 \u00d7 10<sup>0</sup> ohm = 10 ohms\n|-\n|''220''||= 22 \u00d7 10<sup>0</sup> ohm = 22 ohms\n|}\n\nSometimes these values are marked as ''10'' or ''22'' to prevent a mistake.\n\nResistances less than 10 ohms have 'R' to indicate the position of the decimal point ([[radix point]]). For example:\n\n{|\n|-\n|''4R7''||= 4.7 ohms\n|-\n|''R300''||= 0.30 ohms\n|-\n|''0R22''||= 0.22 ohms\n|-\n|''0R01''||= 0.01 ohms\n|}\n\nPrecision resistors are marked with a four-digit code, in which the first three digits are the significant figures and the fourth is the power of ten. For example:\n\n{|\n|-\n|''1001''||= 100 \u00d7 10<sup>1</sup> ohms = 1.00 kilohm\n|-\n|''4992''||= 499 \u00d7 10<sup>2</sup> ohms = 49.9 kilohm\n|-\n|''1000''||= 100 \u00d7 10<sup>0</sup> ohm = 100 ohms\n|}\n\n''000'' and ''0000'' sometimes appear as values on surface-mount [[zero-ohm link]]s, since these have (approximately) zero resistance.\n\nMore recent surface-mount resistors are too small, physically, to permit practical markings to be applied.\n\n===Industrial type designation===\n'''Format:'''''<nowiki>  [two letters]<space>[resistance value (three digit)]<nospace>[tolerance code(numerical \u2013 one digit)]\n</nowiki>''<ref>A.

As a dissipative element, even an ideal resistor naturally produces a randomly fluctuating voltage, or noise, across its terminals.  This [[Johnson\u2013Nyquist noise]] is a fundamental noise source which depends only upon the temperature and resistance of the resistor, and is predicted by the [[fluctuation\u2013dissipation theorem]]. Using a larger value of resistance produces a larger voltage noise, whereas a smaller value of resistance generates more current noise, at a given temperature.\n\nThe thermal noise of a practical resistor may also be larger than the theoretical prediction and that increase is typically frequency-dependent. Excess noise of a practical resistor is observed only when current flows through it. This is specified in unit of \u03bcV/V/decade \u2013 \u03bcV of noise per volt applied across the resistor per decade of frequency.  The \u03bcV/V/decade value is frequently given in dB so that a resistor with a noise index of 0&nbsp;dB exhibits 1 \u03bcV (rms) of excess noise for each volt across the resistor in each frequency decade.  Excess noise is thus an example of [[Flicker noise|1/''f'' noise]].  Thick-film and carbon composition resistors generate more excess noise than other types at low frequencies. Wire-wound and thin-film resistors are often used for their better noise characteristics.  Carbon composition resistors can exhibit a noise index of 0&nbsp;dB while bulk metal foil resistors may have a noise index of \u221240&nbsp;dB, usually making the excess noise of metal foil resistors insignificant.<ref>{{cite book\n| title = Audio Noise Reduction Through the Use of Bulk Metal Foil Resistors \u2013 \"Hear the Difference\"\n| url   = http://www.c-c-i.com/sites/default/files/vse-an00.pdf\n}}, Application note AN0003, Vishay Intertechnology Inc, 12 July 2005.</ref> Thin film surface mount resistors typically have lower noise and better thermal stability than thick film surface mount resistors. Excess noise is also size-dependent: in general excess noise is reduced as the physical size of a resistor is increased (or multiple resistors are used in parallel), as the independently fluctuating resistances of smaller components tend to average out.\n\nWhile not an example of \"noise\" per se, a resistor may act as a [[thermocouple]], producing a small DC voltage differential across it due to the [[thermoelectric effect]] if its ends are at different temperatures. This induced DC voltage can degrade the precision of [[instrumentation amplifier]]s in particular. Such voltages appear in the junctions of the resistor leads with the circuit board and with the resistor body. Common metal film resistors show such an effect at a magnitude of about 20 \u00b5V/\u00b0C. Some carbon composition resistors can exhibit thermoelectric offsets as high as 400 \u00b5V/\u00b0C, whereas specially constructed resistors can reduce this number to 0.05 \u00b5V/\u00b0C. In applications where the thermoelectric effect may become important, care has to be taken to mount the resistors horizontally to avoid temperature gradients and to mind the air flow over the board.<ref>{{cite book\n| title      = Op Amp Applications Handbook\n| author     = Jung, Walt \n| url        = http://www.analog.com/library/analogDialogue/archives/39-05/op_amp_applications_handbook.html\n| chapter    = Chapter 7 \u2013 Hardware and Housekeeping Techniques\n| chapterurl = http://www.analog.com/library/analogDialogue/archives/39-05/Web_Ch7_final_J.pdf\n| page       = 7.11\n| isbn       = 0-7506-7844-5\n}}</ref>\n\n==Failure modes==\nThe failure rate of resistors in a properly designed circuit is low compared to other electronic components such as semiconductors and electrolytic capacitors. Damage to resistors most often occurs due to overheating when the average power delivered to it greatly exceeds its ability to dissipate heat (specified by the resistor's ''power rating''). This may be due to a fault external to the circuit, but is frequently caused by the failure of another component (such as a transistor that shorts out) in the circuit connected to the resistor. Operating a resistor too close to its power rating can limit the resistor's lifespan or cause a significant change in its resistance. A safe design generally uses overrated resistors in power applications to avoid this danger.\n\nLow-power thin-film resistors can be damaged by long-term high-voltage stress, even below maximum specified voltage and below maximum power rating. This is often the case for the startup resistors feeding the SMPS integrated circuit.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nWhen overheated, carbon-film resistors may decrease or increase in resistance.<ref>{{cite web\n| title      = Electronic components \u2013 resistors\n| work       = Inspector's Technical Guide\n| publisher  = US Food and Drug Administration\n| date       = 1978-01-16\n| url        = http://www.fda.gov/ora/Inspect_ref/itg/itg31.html\n| accessdate = 2008-06-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080403111045/http://www.fda.gov/ora/Inspect_ref/itg/itg31.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-04-03}}</ref>\nCarbon film and composition resistors can fail (open circuit) if running close to their maximum dissipation. This is also possible but less likely with metal film and wirewound resistors.\n\nThere can also be failure of resistors due to mechanical stress and adverse environmental factors including humidity. If not enclosed, wirewound resistors can corrode.\n\nSurface mount resistors have been known to fail due to the ingress of sulfur into the internal makeup of the resistor.  This sulfur chemically reacts with the silver layer to produce non-conductive silver sulfide.  The resistor's impedance goes to infinity.  Sulfur resistant and anti-corrosive resistors are sold into automotive, industrial, and military applications.  ASTM B809 is an industry standard that tests a part's susceptibility to sulfur.\n\nAn alternative failure mode can be encountered where large value resistors are used (hundreds of kilohms and higher).  Resistors are not only specified with a maximum power dissipation, but also for a maximum voltage drop.  Exceeding this voltage causes the resistor to degrade slowly reducing in resistance.  The voltage dropped across large value resistors can be exceeded before the power dissipation reaches its limiting value.  Since the maximum voltage specified for commonly encountered resistors is a few hundred volts, this is a problem only in applications where these voltages are encountered.\n\nVariable resistors can also degrade in a different manner, typically involving poor contact between the wiper and the body of the resistance. This may be due to dirt or corrosion and is typically perceived as \"crackling\" as the contact resistance fluctuates; this is especially noticed as the device is adjusted. This is similar to crackling caused by poor contact in switches, and like switches, potentiometers are to some extent self-cleaning: running the wiper across the resistance may improve the contact. Potentiometers which are seldom adjusted, especially in dirty or harsh environments, are most likely to develop this problem. When self-cleaning of the contact is insufficient, improvement can usually be obtained through the use of contact cleaner (also known as \"tuner cleaner\") spray. The crackling noise associated with turning the shaft of a dirty potentiometer in an audio circuit (such as the volume control) is greatly accentuated when an undesired DC voltage is present, often indicating the failure of a DC blocking capacitor in the circuit.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n*[[Circuit design]]\n*[[Dummy load]]\n*[[Electrical impedance]]\n*[[Iron-hydrogen resistor]]\n*[[Piezoresistive effect]]\n*[[Shot noise]]\n*[[Thermistor]]\n*[[Trimmer (electronics)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikibooks\n| 1 = Electronics\n| 2 = Resistors\n| 3 = Resistors\n}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Commons category|Resistors}}\n*[http://www.powerstandards.com/4terminal.htm 4-terminal resistors \u2013 How ultra-precise resistors work]\n*[http://sound.westhost.com/pots.htm Beginner's guide to potentiometers, including description of different tapers]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110401175312/http://www.ese.upenn.edu/rca/calcjs.html Color Coded Resistance Calculator \u2013 archived with WayBack Machine]\n*[http://www.aikenamps.com/ResistorNoise.htm Resistor Types \u2013 Does It Matter?]\n* [http://www.divilabs.com/2013/08/standard-resistors-capicitors-value.html Standard Resistors & Capacitor Values That Industry Manufactures]\n*[http://www.analog.com/library/analogDialogue/archives/31-1/Ask_Engineer.html Ask The Applications Engineer \u2013 Difference between types of resistors]\n*[http://www.ipass.net/teara/resistor-frm.html Resistors and their uses]\n\n{{Electronic component}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Electrical components]]\n[[Category:Electric heating]]\n[[Category:Resistive components]]"}]}}}}
