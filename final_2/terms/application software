Examples of an application include a [[word processor]], a [[spreadsheet]], an [[accounting software|accounting application]], a [[web browser]], a [[media player (application software)|media player]], an aeronautical [[flight simulator]], a [[console game]] or a [[photo editor]]. The [[collective noun]] '''application software''' refers to all applications collectively.<ref>{{cite web |title=Application software |url=http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/37919/application-program | work=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}</ref> This contrasts with [[system software]], which is mainly involved with running the computer.\n\nApplications may be [[Product bundling|bundled]] with the computer and its system software or published separately, and may be coded as [[proprietary software|proprietary]], [[open-source]] or university projects.<ref>{{cite web|last = Ryan|first = Thorne|url = https://arbiteronline.com/2013/03/14/caffeine-and-computer-screens-student-programmers-endure-weekend-long-appathon/|title = Caffeine and computer screens: student programmers endure weekend long appathon|website = The Arbiter|date = 2013-03-14|accessdate = 2015-10-12}}\n</ref> Apps built for [[mobile device|mobile platform]]s are called [[mobile app]]s.\n\n== Terminology ==\nIn [[information technology]], an application is a [[computer program]] designed to help people perform an activity. An application thus differs from an [[operating system]] (which runs a computer), a [[Utility software|utility]] (which performs maintenance or general-purpose chores), and a [[programming tool]] (with which computer programs are created){{OR|date=June 2014}}. Depending on the activity for which it was designed, an application can manipulate text, numbers, graphics, or a combination of these elements. Some application packages focus on a single task, such as word processing; others, called [[integrated software]] include several applications.<ref>Ceruzzi, Paul E. (2000). ''A History of Modern Computing''. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press. ISBN 0-262-03255-4.</ref>\n\n[[End-user development|User-written software]] tailors systems to meet the user's specific needs. User-written software includes spreadsheet templates, word processor macros, scientific simulations, graphics and animation scripts. Even [[email filter]]s are a kind of user software. Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is.\n\nThe delineation between system software such as [[operating system]]s and application software is not exact, however, and is occasionally the object of controversy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulrich|first1=William|title=Application Package Software: The Promise Vs. Reality|url=https://www.cutter.com/article/application-package-software-promise-vs-reality-393871|publisher=Cutter Consortium}}</ref>  For example, one of the key questions in the [[United States v. Microsoft]] [[antitrust]] trial was whether Microsoft's [[Internet Explorer]] [[web browser]] was part of its [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system or a separable piece of application software.  As another example, the [[GNU/Linux naming controversy]] is, in part, due to disagreement about the relationship between the [[Linux kernel]] and the operating systems built over this [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]]. In some types of [[embedded system]]s, the application software and the operating system software may be indistinguishable to the user, as in the case of software used to control a [[VCR]], [[DVD]] player or [[microwave oven]]. The above definitions may exclude some applications that may exist on some computers in large organizations. For an alternative definition of an app: '' see [[Application Portfolio Management#Definition of an application|Application Portfolio Management]].''\n\n===Metonymy===\nThe word \"application\", once used as an adjective, is not restricted to the \"of or pertaining to application software\" meaning.<ref>[https://www.cutter.com/article/application-package-software-promise-vs-reality-393871 Application Package Software: The Promise Vs. Reality]</ref> For example, concepts such as [[application programming interface]] (API), [[application server]], [[application virtualization]], [[application lifecycle management]] and [[portable application]] apply to all computer programs alike, not just application software.\n\n===Apps and killer apps===\nSome applications are available in versions for several different platforms; others have narrower requirements and are thus called, for example, a [[Geographic information system|Geography]] application for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] application for [[Educational software|education]], or [[Linux gaming]].  Sometimes a new and popular application arises which only runs on one [[Computing platform|platform]], increasing the desirability of that platform.  This is called a [[killer application]] or killer app.\n\nIn recent years, the shortened term \"app\" (coined in 1981 or earlier<ref>[http://www.osnews.com/story/24882/The_History_of_App_and_the_Demise_of_the_Programmer The History of 'App' and the Demise of the Programmer]</ref>) has become popular to refer to [[Mobile app|applications for mobile devices]] such as [[smartphone]]s and [[Tablet computer|tablets]], the shortened form matching their typically smaller scope compared to applications on PCs.\n\n== Classification ==\n\nThere are many different ways to divide up different types of application software, and several are explained here.\n\nSince the development and near-universal adoption of the [[World Wide Web|web]], an important distinction that has emerged has been between [[web application]]s &mdash; written with [[HTML]], [[JavaScript]] and other web-native technologies and typically requiring one to be online and running a [[web browser]], and the more traditional native applications written in whatever languages are available for one's particular type of computer. There has been contentious debate in the computing community regarding web applications replacing native applications for many purposes, especially on mobile devices such as [[smart phone]]s and [[Tablet computer|tablet]]s. Web apps have indeed greatly increased in popularity for some uses, but the advantages of applications make them unlikely to disappear soon, if ever. Furthermore, the two can be complementary, and even integrated.<ref>{{cite news | first = Jean-Louis | last = Gass\u00e9e | title = The Silly Web vs. Native Apps Debate | date = 2012-09-17 | url = http://www.thisurlisfalse.com/the-silly-web-vs-native-apps-debate/ | work = The Silly Web vs. Native Apps Debate | accessdate = 2013-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Casey | last = Frechette | title = What journalists need to know about the difference between Web apps and native apps | date = 2013-04-11 | url = http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/digital-strategies/209768/what-journalists-need-to-know-about-the-difference-between-web-apps-and-native-apps/ | work = Poynter | accessdate = 2013-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Valums | title = Web apps vs desktop apps | date = 2010-02-10 | url = http://valums.com/web-apps/ | work = valums.com | accessdate = 2013-07-14}}</ref>\n\nApplication software can also be seen as being either [[horizontal market software|horizontal]] or [[vertical market software|vertical]].<ref>{{cite web|title=What Is a Horizontal Application?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-horizontal-application.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What Are Horizontal Services?|url=http://eduunix.ccut.edu.cn/index2/html/java/Que.Special.Edition.Using.Enterprise.JavaBeans.2.0.internal.eBook-LiB/ch21lev1sec1.html}}</ref>  Horizontal applications are more popular and widespread, because they are general purpose, for example word processors or databases. Vertical applications are [[niche product]]s, designed for a particular type of industry or business, or department within an organization. Integrated suites of software will try to handle every specific aspect possible of, for example, manufacturing or banking systems, or accounting, or customer service.\n\nThere are many types of application software:{{fact|date=November 2016}}\n\n* An ''[[application suite]]'' consists of multiple applications bundled together. They usually have related functions, features and user interfaces, and may be able to interact with each other, e.g. open each other's files. [[Business software|Business applications]] often come in suites, e.g. [[Microsoft Office]], [[LibreOffice]] and [[iWork]], which bundle together a word processor, a spreadsheet, etc.; but suites exist for other purposes, e.g. graphics or music.\n* ''[[Enterprise software]]'' addresses the needs of an entire organization's processes and data flows, across several departments, often in a large distributed environment.  Examples include [[enterprise resource planning]] systems, [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) systems and [[supply chain management software]]. Departmental Software is a sub-type of enterprise software with a focus on smaller organizations and/or groups within a large organization. (Examples include travel [[expense management]] and IT Helpdesk.)\n* ''Enterprise infrastructure software'' provides common capabilities needed to support enterprise [[software systems]].  (Examples include databases, email servers, and systems for managing networks and security.)\n* ''[[Information worker]] software'' lets users create and manage information, often for individual projects within a department, in contrast to enterprise management. Examples include [[time management]], [[schedule (workplace)|resource management]], analytical, collaborative and documentation tools. Word processors, spreadsheets, email and blog clients, personal information system, and individual media editors may aid in multiple information worker tasks.\n* ''Content access software'' is used primarily to access content without editing, but may include software that allows for content editing. Such software addresses the needs of individuals and groups to consume digital entertainment and published digital content. (Examples include [[Media player (application software)|media players]], [[web browser]]s, and help browsers.)\n* ''[[Educational software]]'' is related to content access software, but has the content and/or features adapted for use in by educators or students. For example, it may deliver evaluations (tests), track progress through material, or include collaborative capabilities.\n* ''[[Simulation software]]'' simulates physical or abstract systems for either research, training or entertainment purposes.\n* ''Media development software'' generates print and electronic media for others to consume, most often in a commercial or educational setting. This includes graphic-art software, desktop publishing software, multimedia development software, HTML editors, digital-animation editors, digital audio and video composition, and many others.<ref>Campbell-Kelly, Martin; Aspray, William (1996). ''Computer: A History of the Information Machine''. New York: Basic Books. ISBN 0-465-02990-6.</ref>\n* ''Product engineering software'' is used in developing hardware and software products. This includes [[computer-aided design]] (CAD), [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE), computer language editing and compiling tools, [[integrated development environment]]s, and application programmer interfaces.\n* ''Entertainment Software'' can refer to video games, screen savers, programs to display motion pictures or play recorded music, and other forms of entertainment which can be experienced through use of a computing device.\n\nApplications can also be classified by [[computing platform]] such as a particular [[operating system]], delivery network such as in [[cloud computing]] and [[Web 2.0]] applications, or delivery devices such as [[mobile apps]] for [[mobile device]]s.\n\nThe operating system itself can be considered application software when performing simple calculating, measuring, rendering, and word processing tasks not used to control hardware via [[command-line interface]] or [[graphical user interface]]. This does not include application software bundled within operating systems such as a [[software calculator]] or [[text editor]].\n\n=== Information worker software ===\n* [[Accounting software]]\n* Data management\n** [[Contact manager]]\n** [[Spreadsheet]]\n** [[Database software]]\n* Documentation\n** [[Document automation]]\n** [[Word processor]]\n** [[Desktop publishing software]]\n** Diagramming software\n** [[Presentation software]]\n** [[Email]]\n** Blog software\n* [[Enterprise resource planning]]\n* [[:Category:Financial software|Financial software]]\n** [[Day trading software]]\n** [[Banking software]]\n** [[Clearing (finance)|Clearing systems]]\n** arithmetic software\n* [[Field service management]]\n**[[Workforce management#Workforce management software|Workforce management software]]\n* [[Project management software]]\n** [[Calendaring software]]\n** [[Employee scheduling software]]\n** [[Workflow software]]\n* [[Reservation systems]]\n\n=== Entertainment software ===\n* [[Screen saver]]s\n* [[Video game]]s\n** [[Arcade game]]s\n** [[Console game]]s\n** [[Mobile game]]s\n** [[Personal computer game]]s\n\n=== Educational software ===\n\n* Classroom management\n* [[Reference software]]\n* Sales readiness software\n* Survey management\n\n=== Enterprise infrastructure software ===\n\n* Business [[workflow]] software\n* [[Database management system]] (DBMS)\n* [[Digital asset management]] (DAM) software\n* [[Document management]] software\n* [[Geographic information system]] (GIS)\n\n=== Simulation software ===\n\n* [[Computer simulator]]s\n** [[Computational science|Scientific simulator]]s\n** [[Social simulator]]s\n** [[Military simulation|Battlefield simulator]]s\n** Emergency simulators\n** Vehicle simulators\n*** [[Flight simulator]]s\n*** [[Driving simulator]]s\n** [[Simulation game]]s\n*** [[Vehicle simulation game]]s\n\n=== Media development software ===\n\n* [[3D computer graphics software]]\n* [[Animation software]]\n* [[Graphic art software]]\n** [[Raster graphics editor]]\n** [[Vector graphics editor]]\n* [[Image organizer]]\n* [[Video editing software]]\n* [[Audio editing software]]\n** [[Digital audio workstation]]\n* [[Music sequencer]]\n** [[Scorewriter]]\n* [[HTML editor]]\n* [[Game development tool]]\n\n=== Product engineering software ===\n\n* [[Engineering|Hardware engineering]]\n** [[Computer-aided engineering]]\n** [[Computer-aided design|Computer-aided design (CAD)]]\n** [[Finite element analysis]]\n* [[Software engineering]]\n** [[Compiler|Compiler software]]\n** [[Integrated development environment]]\n*** [[Compiler]]\n*** [[Linker (computing)|Linker]]\n*** [[Version control]]\n*** [[Game development tool]]\n*** [[Debugger]]\n*** [[License manager]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Advantages]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{commonscatinline|Application software}}\n*{{wikiversity-inline | application software}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Application Software}}\n[[Category:Application software| ]]"}]}}}}
