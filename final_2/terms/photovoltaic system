It consists of an arrangement of several components, including [[solar panel]]s to absorb and convert sunlight into electricity, a [[solar inverter]] to change the electric current from DC to AC, as well as [[photovoltaic mounting system|mounting]], [[solar cable|cabling]] and other electrical accessories to set up a working system. It may also use a [[solar tracking system]] to improve the system's overall performance and include an [[rechargeable battery|integrated battery solution]], as prices for storage devices are expected to decline. Strictly speaking, a '''solar array''' only encompasses the ensemble of solar panels, the visible part of the PV system, and does not include all the other hardware, often summarized as [[balance of system]] (BOS). Moreover, PV systems convert light directly into electricity and shouldn't be confused with other technologies, such as [[concentrated solar power]] or [[Solar thermal energy|solar thermal]], used for heating and cooling.\n\nPV systems range from small, [[rooftop photovoltaic power station|rooftop-mounted]] or [[building-integrated photovoltaics|building-integrated]] systems with capacities from a few to several tens of kilowatts, to large [[photovoltaic power station|utility-scale power station]]s of hundreds of megawatts. Nowadays, most PV systems are [[grid-connected photovoltaic power system|grid-connected]], while off-grid or [[Stand-alone power system|stand-alone systems]] only account for a small portion of the market.\n\nOperating silently and without any moving parts or [[Air pollution|environmental emissions]], PV systems have developed from being niche market applications into a mature technology used for mainstream electricity generation. A rooftop system [[Crystalline silicon#Energy payback time|recoups]] the invested energy for its manufacturing and installation within 0.7 to 2 years and produces about 95 percent of net clean [[renewable energy]] over a 30-year service lifetime.<ref name=Fraunhofer-PR-2014 />{{rp|30}}<ref>[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/fy97/22572.pdf Service Lifetime Prediction for Encapsulated Photovoltaic Cells/Minimodules], A.W.

This energy may be shared by a residential or commercial building before or after the revenue measurement point. The difference being whether the credited energy production is calculated independently of the customer's energy consumption ([[feed-in tariff]]) or only on the difference of energy ([[net metering]]). Grid connected systems vary in size from residential (2\u201310&nbsp;kW<sub>p</sub>) to solar power stations (up to 10s of MW<sub>p</sub>). This is a form of [[decentralized electricity generation]]. The feeding of electricity into the grid requires the transformation of DC into AC by a special, synchronising [[grid-tie inverter]]. In kilowatt-sized installations the DC side system voltage is as high as permitted (typically 1000V except US residential 600&nbsp;V) to limit ohmic losses. Most modules (60 or 72 crystalline silicon cells) generate 160&nbsp;W to 300&nbsp;W at 36 volts. It is sometimes necessary or desirable to connect the modules partially in parallel rather than all in series. One set of modules connected in series is known as a 'string'.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.homepower.com/view/?file=HP113_pg106_WordPower |title=Photovoltaic...

Their capacities range from a few kilowatts to hundreds of megawatts. A typical residential system is around 10 kilowatts and mounted on a sloped roof, while commercial systems may reach a megawatt-scale and are generally installed on low-slope or even flat roofs. Although rooftop mounted systems are small and display a higher [[cost per watt]] than large utility-scale installations, they account for the largest share in the market. There is, however, a growing trend towards bigger utility-scale power plants, especially in the \"sunbelt\" region of the planet.<ref name=epia-outlook-2014 />{{rp|43}}<ref>NREL.gov [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/53347.pdf Residential, Commercial, and Utility-Scale Photovoltaic (PV) System Prices in the United States], p.6 February 2012</ref>\n\n; Utility-scale\n{{main article|Photovoltaic power station}}\n[[File:Perovosolarstation.jpg|thumb|[[Perovo Solar Park]] in Ukraine]]\n\n: Large utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station|solar parks or farms]] are [[power station]]s and capable of providing an energy supply to large numbers of consumers.

In the best of cases, uncertainties are typically 4% for year-to-year climate variability, 5% for solar resource estimation (in a horizontal plane), 3% for estimation of irradiation in the plane of the array, 3% for power rating of modules, 2% for losses due to dirt and soiling, 1.5% for losses due to snow, and 5% for other sources of error. Identifying and reacting to manageable losses is critical for revenue and O&M efficiency. Monitoring of array performance may be part of contractual agreements between the array owner, the builder, and the utility purchasing the energy produced. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Recently, a method to create \"synthetic days\" using readily available weather data and verification using the [[Open Solar Outdoors Test Field]] make it possible to predict photovoltaic systems performance with high degrees of accuracy.<ref>Rob Andrews, Andrew Pollard, Joshua M.

The term originates from the fact that some BOS-components are balancing the power-generating subsystem of the solar array with the power-using side, the load. BOS-components include power-conditioning equipment and structures for mounting, typically one or more DC to [[alternating current|AC]] power converters, also known as [[Power inverter|inverters]], an energy storage device, a racking system that supports the solar array, electrical wiring and interconnections, and mounting for other components.\n\nOptionally, a balance of system may include any or all of the following: [[renewable energy credit]] revenue-grade meter, [[maximum power point tracker]] (MPPT), [[Rechargeable battery|battery]] system and [[battery charger|charger]], [[GPS]] [[solar tracker]], [[energy management software]], [[solar irradiance]] sensors, [[anemometer]], or task-specific accessories designed to meet specialized requirements for a system owner. In addition, a [[Concentrated photovoltaics|CPV]] system requires [[optical lens]]es or mirrors and sometimes a cooling system.\n\nThe terms ''\"solar array\"'' and ''\"PV system\"'' are often used interchangeably, despite the fact that the solar array does not encompass the entire system. Moreover, ''\"solar panel\"'' is often used as a synonym for ''\"solar module\"'', although a panel consists of a string of several modules. The term ''\"[[solar system]]\"'' is also an often used [[misnomer]] for a PV system.\n\n=== Solar array ===\n{{further information|PV module}}\n\nConventional [[Crystalline silicon|c-Si]] [[solar cell]]s, normally wired in series, are encapsulated in a solar module to protect them from the weather. The module consists of a [[tempered glass]] as cover, a soft and flexible [[ethylene vinyl acetate|encapsulant]], a rear backsheet made of a weathering and fire-resistant [[Polyvinyl fluoride|material]] and an aluminium frame around the outer edge. Electrically connected and mounted on a supporting structure, solar modules build a string of modules, often called solar panel. A solar array consists of one or many such panels.<ref>PV Education.org [http://pveducation.org/pvcdrom/modules/module-materials Module Materials]</ref> A photovoltaic array, or solar array, is a linked collection of [[solar panel]]s. The power that one module can produce is seldom enough to meet requirements of a home or a business, so the modules are linked together to form an array. Most PV arrays use an [[solar inverter|inverter]] to convert the DC power produced by the modules into [[alternating current]] that can power [[light]]s, motors, and other loads. The modules in a PV array are usually first connected in [[Series circuits|series]] to obtain the desired [[voltage]]; the individual strings are then connected in [[Parallel circuits|parallel]] to allow the system to produce more [[Electric current|current]]. Solar panels are typically measured under STC (standard test conditions) or PTC (PVUSA test conditions), in [[watt]]s.<ref>[http://www.millenniumplanet.com/solar-buyers-guide.html Key Factors in selecting solar components]</ref> Typical panel ratings range from less than 100 watts to over 400 watts.<ref>[http://www.gosolarcalifornia.ca.gov/equipment/pv_modules.php List of Eligible SB1 Guidelines Compliant Photovoltaic Modules]</ref> The array rating consists of a summation of the panel ratings, in watts, kilowatts, or megawatts.\n\n; Module and efficiency\n\nA typical \"150 watt\" [[PV module]] is about a square meter in size. Such a module may be expected to produce 0.75&nbsp; [[kilowatt-hour]] (kWh) every day, on average, after taking into account the weather and the latitude, for an insolation of 5 sun hours/day. In the last 10 years, the efficiency of average commercial wafer-based [[crystalline silicon]] modules increased from about 12% to 16% and CdTe module efficiency increased from 9% to 13% during same period. Module output and life degraded by increased temperature. Allowing ambient air to flow over, and if possible behind, PV modules reduces this problem. Effective module lives are typically 25 years or more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www4.agr.gc.ca/AAFC-AAC/display-afficher.do?id=1187620075153&lang=eng|title=Solar Power (Photovoltaic, PV)|work=Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada|accessdate=5 February 2010}}</ref> The payback period for an investment in a PV solar installation varies greatly and is typically less useful than a calculation of [[return on investment]].<ref>[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/blog/post/2010/04/the-worst-metric-in-renewables-the-payback-period The Worst Metric in Renewables: 'The Payback Period'].

''Photovoltaic systems engineering''. CRC press, 2004.</ref> When even a small portion of a cell, module, or array is shaded, while the remainder is in sunlight, the output falls dramatically due to internal 'short-circuiting' (the electrons reversing course through the shaded portion of the [[p-n junction]]). If the current drawn from the series string of cells is no greater than the current that can be produced by the shaded cell, the current (and so power) developed by the string is limited. If enough voltage is available from the rest of the cells in a string, current will be forced through the cell by breaking down the junction in the shaded portion. This breakdown voltage in common cells is between 10 and 30 volts. Instead of adding to the power produced by the panel, the shaded cell absorbs power, turning it into heat. Since the reverse voltage of a shaded cell is much greater than the forward voltage of an illuminated cell, one shaded cell can absorb the power of many other cells in the string, disproportionately affecting panel output. For example, a shaded cell may drop 8 volts, instead of adding 0.5 volts, at a particular current level, thereby absorbing the power produced by 16 other cells.<ref name=UE03>Ursula Eicker, ''Solar Technologies for Buildings'', Wiley 2003, ISBN 0-471-48637-X, page 226</ref> It is, thus important that a PV installation is not shaded by trees or other obstructions.\n\nSeveral methods have been developed to determine shading losses from trees to PV systems over both large regions using [[LiDAR]],<ref>H.

The main job of the bypass diode is to eliminate hot spots that form on cells that can cause further damage to the array, and cause fires.

For [[solar park]]s a large rack is mounted on the ground, and the modules mounted on the rack.\nFor buildings, many different racks have been devised for pitched roofs. For flat roofs, racks, bins and building integrated solutions are used.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Solar panel racks mounted on top of poles can be stationary or moving, see Trackers below. Side-of-pole mounts are suitable for situations where a pole has something else mounted at its top, such as a light fixture or an antenna. Pole mounting raises what would otherwise be a ground mounted array above weed shadows and livestock, and may satisfy electrical code requirements regarding inaccessibility of exposed wiring. Pole mounted panels are open to more cooling air on their underside, which increases performance. A multiplicity of pole top racks can be formed into a parking carport or other shade structure. A rack which does not follow the sun from left to right may allow seasonal adjustment up or down.\n\n=== Cabling ===\n{{main article|Solar cable|Electrical wiring}}\n\nDue to their outdoor usage, [[solar cable]]s are specifically designed to be resistant against [[UV]] radiation and extremely high temperature fluctuations and are generally unaffected by the weather.

Grid connected inverters must supply AC electricity in sinusoidal form, synchronized to the grid frequency, limit feed in voltage to no higher than the grid voltage and disconnect from the grid if the grid voltage is turned off.<ref>[http://homepower.com/article/?file=HP130_pg28_ATE_2 Grid-Tied Inverter Safety].

For example, a PV system comprising 11 [[kilowatt]]s DC (kW<sub>DC</sub>) worth of PV modules, paired with one 10-kilowatt AC (kW<sub>AC</sub>) inverter, will be limited to the inverter's output of 10&nbsp;kW. As of 2014, conversion efficiency for state-of-the-art converters reached more than 98 percent. While string inverters are used in residential to medium-sized commercial PV systems, central inverters cover the large commercial and utility-scale market. Market-share for central and string inverters are about 50 percent and 48 percent, respectively, leaving less than 2 percent to micro-inverters.<ref name=\"fraunhofer-report-september-2014\" />\n\n[[Maximum power point tracking]] (MPPT) is a technique that grid connected inverters use to get the maximum possible power from the photovoltaic array. In order to do so, the inverter's MPPT system digitally samples the solar array's ever changing power output and applies the proper resistance to find the optimal ''maximum power point''.<ref>http://www.solar-electric.com [http://www.solar-electric.com/mppt-solar-charge-controllers.html All About Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT)]</ref>\n\n[[Anti-islanding]] is a protection mechanism that immediately shuts down the inverter preventing it from generating AC power when the connection to the load no longer exists. This happens, for example, in the case of a blackout. Without this protection, the supply line would become an \"island\" with power surrounded by a \"sea\" of unpowered lines, as the solar array continues to deliver DC power during the power outage. Islanding is a hazard to utility workers, who may not realize that an AC circuit is still powered, and it may prevent automatic re-connection of devices.<ref>EDN.com [http://www.edn.com/design/systems-design/4391907/Product-How-To--Solar-power-anti-islanding-and-control Solar power anti-islanding and control], 7 August 2012</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 4px auto; max-width: 80%;\"\n|+ Inverter/Converter Market in 2014\n|-\n!

Rather than simply shut off the free PV energy when not needed, a user may choose to heat air or water once the battery is full.\n\n=== Monitoring and metering ===\n\n{{main article|Net metering|Energy metering|Smart meter}}\nThe metering must be able to accumulate energy units in both directions or two meters must be used. Many meters accumulate bidirectionally, some systems use two meters, but a unidirectional meter (with detent) will not accumulate energy from any resultant feed into the grid.<ref>[http://www.solarelectricpower.org/media/84144/sepa%20pv%20metering.pdf Residential Photovoltaic Metering and Interconnection Study]</ref> In some countries, for installations over 30 [[Nominal power (photovoltaic)#Watt-peak|kW<sub>p</sub>]] a frequency and a voltage monitor with disconnection of all phases is required. This is done where more solar power is being generated than can be accommodated by the utility, and the excess can not either be exported or [[Grid energy storage|stored]]. Grid operators historically have needed to provide transmission lines and generation capacity. Now they need to also provide storage. This is normally hydro-storage, but other means of storage are used. Initially storage was used so that baseload generators could operate at full output. With [[variable renewable energy]], storage is needed to allow power generation whenever it is available, and consumption whenever it is needed. [[File:Stromz\u00e4hler in Kanada.JPG|thumb|left|A Canadian electricity meter]]\nThe two variables a grid operator have are storing electricity for ''when'' it is needed, or transmitting it to ''where'' it is needed. If both of those fail, installations over 30kWp can automatically shut down, although in practice all inverters maintain voltage regulation and stop supplying power if the load is inadequate. Grid operators have the option of curtailing excess generation from large systems, although this is more commonly done with wind power than solar power, and results in a substantial loss of revenue.<ref>[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/53732.pdf Integrating Variable Renewable Energy in Electric Power Markets]</ref> Three-phase inverters have the unique option of supplying reactive power which can be advantageous in matching load requirements.<ref>[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/01/smart-pv-inverter-benefits-for-utilities Smart PV Inverter Benefits for Utilities]</ref>\n\nPhotovoltaic systems need to be monitored to detect breakdown and optimize their operation. There are several ''photovoltaic monitoring'' strategies depending on the output of the installation and its nature. Monitoring can be performed on site or remotely. It can measure production only, retrieve all the data from the inverter or retrieve all of the data from the communicating equipment (probes, meters, etc.). Monitoring tools can be dedicated to supervision only or offer additional functions. Individual inverters and battery charge controllers may include monitoring using manufacturer specific protocols and software.<ref>[https://enphase.com/en-us/products-and-services/enlighten-and-apps Enphase Solar Monitoring]</ref> Energy metering of an inverter may be of limited accuracy and not suitable for revenue metering purposes. A third-party data acquisition system can monitor multiple inverters, using the inverter manufacturer's protocols, and also acquire weather-related information. Independent [[smart meter]]s may measure the total energy production of a PV array system. Separate measures such as satellite image analysis or a solar radiation meter (a [[pyranometer]]) can be used to estimate total insolation for comparison.<ref>[https://buildingsfieldtest.nrel.gov/solar_irradiance_measurements Solar Irradiance Measurements]</ref> \nData collected from a monitoring system can be [[List of monitored photovoltaic power stations|displayed remotely]] over the World Wide Web, such as [[OSOTF]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pearce|first=Joshua.

However, [[Stand-alone power system|standalone]] or off-grid systems take a special place. They were the most common type of systems during the 1980s and 1990s, when PV technology was still very expensive and a pure niche market of small scale applications. Only in places where no electrical grid was available, they were economically viable. Although new stand-alone systems are still being deployed all around the world, their contribution to the overall installed photovoltaic capacity is decreasing. In Europe, off-grid systems account for 1 percent of installed capacity. In the United States, they account for about 10 percent. Off-grid systems are still common in Australia and South Korea, and in many developing countries.<ref name=epia-outlook-2014 />{{rp|14}}\n\n=== CPV ===\n{{main article|Concentrator photovoltaics}}\n[[File:Concentraci\u00f3 Fotovoltaica.jpg|thumb|right|[[Concentrator photovoltaic]] (CPV) in [[Catalonia]], Spain]]\n\nConcentrator photovoltaics (CPV) and ''high concentrator photovoltaic'' (HCPV) systems use [[optical lens]]es or curved mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto small but highly efficient solar cells. Besides concentrating optics, CPV systems sometime use solar trackers and cooling systems and are more expensive.\n\nEspecially HCPV systems are best suited in location with high solar irradiance, concentrating sunlight up to 400 times or more, with efficiencies of 24\u201328 percent, exceeding those of regular systems. Various designs of CPV and HCPV systems are commercially available but not very common. However, ongoing research and development is taking place.<ref name=Fraunhofer-PR-2014 />{{rp|26}}\n\nCPV is often confused with CSP ([[concentrated solar power]]) that does not use photovoltaics. Both technologies favor locations that receive much sunlight and are directly competing with each other.\n\n=== Hybrid ===\n\n[[File:Hybrid Power System.gif|thumb|A [[Solar hybrid power systems|wind-solar PV hybrid system]]]]\n\nA hybrid system combines PV with other forms of generation, usually a diesel generator. Biogas is also used. The other form of generation may be a type able to modulate power output as a function of demand. However more than one renewable form of energy may be used e.g. wind. The photovoltaic power generation serves to reduce the consumption of non renewable fuel. Hybrid systems are most often found on islands. [[Pellworm]] island in Germany and [[Kythnos]] island in Greece are notable examples (both are combined with wind).<ref>[http://www.pvresources.com/en/hybrid.php PV resources website], Hybrid power station accessed 10 Feb 08</ref><ref>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719072419/http://www.pellworm.de/energieversorgung.0.html |date=July 19, 2011 |title=Daten und Fakten }}.

However, financing costs for such hybrids are crucial and largely depend on the ownership structure of the power plant. While cost reductions for state-owned utilities can be significant, the study also identified economic benefits to be insignificant or even negative for non-public utilities, such as [[independent power producer]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/current/2015/kw22/new-study-hybridising-electricity-grids-with-solar-pv-saves-costs-especially-benefits-state-owned-utilities.html |title=New study: Hybridising electricity grids with solar PV saves costs, especially benefits state-owned utilities |publisher=SolarServer.com |date=31 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://fs-unep-centre.org/publications/renewable-energy-hybrid-mini-grids-and-isolated-grids-economic-benefits-and-business#overlay-context=publications |title=Renewable Energy in Hybrid Mini-Grids and Isolated Grids: Economic Benefits and Business Cases |publisher=Frankfurt School \u2013 UNEP Collaborating Centre for Climate & Sustainable Energy Finance |date=May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere has also been recent work showing that the PV penetration limit can be increased by deploying a distributed network of PV+CHP hybrid systems in the U.S.<ref>{{cite journal|author=J.

The cost of land is more expensive, and there are fewer rules and regulations for structures built on bodies of water not used for recreation. Unlike most land-based solar plants, floating arrays can be unobtrusive because they are hidden from public view. They achieve higher efficiencies than PV panels on land, because water cools the panels. The panels have a special coating to prevent rust or corrosion.<ref>Erica Goodemay, [http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/science/solar-power-floating-on-water.html?_r=0 New Solar Plants Generate Floating Green Power], ''New York Times'', 20 May 2016.</ref>\n\nIn May 2008, the Far Niente Winery in Oakville, California, pioneered the world's first floatovoltaic system by installing 994 solar PV modules with a total capacity of 477&nbsp;kW onto 130 pontoons and floating them on the winery's irrigation pond.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Winery-goes-solar-with-Floatovoltaics-3282171.php |title=Winery goes solar with Floatovoltaics |publisher=SFGate |date=29 May 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref> The primary benefit of such a system is that it avoids the need to sacrifice valuable land area that could be used for another purpose.

Standalone systems vary widely in size and application from [[Solar-powered watch|wristwatches]] or [[Amorphous silicon#Solar cells|calculators]] to remote buildings or [[Solar panels on spacecraft|spacecraft]]. If the load is to be supplied independently of solar [[insolation]], the generated power is stored and buffered with a battery. In non-portable applications where weight is not an issue, such as in buildings, [[lead acid battery|lead acid batteries]] are most commonly used for their low cost and tolerance for abuse.\n\nA charge controller may be incorporated in the system to avoid battery damage by excessive charging or discharging. It may also help to optimize production from the solar array using a maximum power point tracking technique ([[Maximum power point tracking|MPPT]]). However, in simple PV systems where the PV module voltage is matched to the battery voltage, the use of MPPT electronics is generally considered unnecessary, since the battery voltage is stable enough to provide near-maximum power collection from the PV module.\nIn small devices (e.g. calculators, parking meters) only [[direct current]] (DC) is consumed. In larger systems (e.g. buildings, remote water pumps) AC is usually required. To convert the DC from the modules or batteries into AC, an [[Inverter (electrical)|inverter]] is used.\n\nIn [[agriculture|agricultural]] settings, the array may be used to directly power DC [[pump]]s, without the need for an [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]]. In remote settings such as mountainous areas, islands, or other places where a power grid is unavailable, solar arrays can be used as the sole source of electricity, usually by charging a [[storage battery]]. Stand-alone systems closely relate to [[microgeneration]] and [[distributed generation]].\n\n*'''Pico PV systems'''\n\n:The smallest, often portable photovoltaic systems are called pico solar PV systems, or pico solar. They mostly combine a rechargeable battery and charge controller, with a very small PV panel. The panel's nominal capacity is just a few watt-peak (1\u201310 W<sub>p</sub>) and its area less than a tenth of a square meter, or one square foot, in size. A large range of different applications can be solar powered such as music players, fans, portable lamps, security lights, solar lighting kits, solar lanterns and street light ''(see below)'', phone chargers, radios, or even small, seven-inch LCD televisions, that run on less than ten watts. As it is the case for power generation from [[pico hydro]], pico PV systems are useful in small, rural communities that require only a small amount of electricity. Since the efficiency of many appliances have improved considerably, in particular due to the usage of [[LED lights]] and efficient rechargeable batteries, pico solar has become an affordable alternative, especially in the developing world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/technical/rep9_12_PVPS_Pico_Solar_PV_Systems_apr13.pdf |title=Pico Solar PV Systems for Remote Homes \u2013 A new generation of small PV systems for lighting and communication |publisher=IEA-PVPS |date=January 2014}}</ref> The metric prefix ''[[pico-]]'' stands for a ''trillionth'' to indicate the smallness of the system's electric power.\n\n* '''Solar street lights'''\n\n:[[Solar street light]]s raised light sources which are powered by photovoltaic panels generally mounted on the lighting structure. The solar array of such off-grid PV system charges a [[rechargeable battery]], which powers a fluorescent or LED lamp during the night. Solar street lights are stand-alone power systems, and have the advantage of savings on trenching, landscaping, and maintenance costs, as well as on the electric bills, despite their higher initial cost compared to conventional street lighting. They are designed with sufficiently large batteries to ensure operation for at least a week and even in the worst situation, they are expected to dim only slightly.\n\n* '''Telecommunication and signaling'''\n\n:Solar PV power is ideally suited for telecommunication applications such as local telephone exchange, radio and TV broadcasting, microwave and other forms of electronic communication links. This is because, in most telecommunication application, storage batteries are already in use and the electrical system is basically DC. In hilly and mountainous terrain, radio and TV signals may not reach as they get blocked or reflected back due to undulating terrain. At these locations, [[Low-power broadcasting|low power transmitters]] are installed to receive and retransmit the signal for local population.<ref>B.H Khan, 'Non-Conventional Energy Resources', TMH Publications 01-01-2006</ref>\n\n* '''Solar vehicles'''\n\n:[[Solar vehicle]], whether ground, water, air or space vehicles may obtain some or all of the energy required for their operation from the sun. Surface vehicles generally require higher power levels than can be sustained by a practically sized solar array, so a battery assists in meeting peak power demand, and the solar array recharges it. Space vehicles have successfully used solar photovoltaic systems for years of operation, eliminating the weight of fuel or primary batteries.\n\n* '''Solar pumps'''\n\n:One of the most cost effective solar applications is a solar powered pump, as it is far cheaper to purchase a solar panel than it is to run power lines.<ref>[http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/RAJ-JPR-pay-bill-for-4-months-get-power-for-25-years-3491363.html 'Pay bill for 4 months, get power for 25 years']</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Pumping Water with Sunshine|url=http://www.homepower.com/articles/solar-electricity/equipment-products/pumping-water-sunshine|accessdate=7 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Solar Well Pumps|url=https://www.sunrotor.com/|accessdate=7 January 2014}}</ref> They often meet a need for water beyond the reach of power lines, taking the place of a [[windmill]] or [[windpump]].

Another is the refilling of drinking water storage tanks on remote or self-sufficient homes.\n\n* '''Spacecraft'''\n\n:[[Solar panels on spacecraft]] have been one of the first applications of photovoltaics since the launch of [[Vanguard 1]] in 1958, the first satellite to use solar cells. Contrary to [[Sputnik]], the first artificial satellite to orbit the planet, that ran out of batteries within 21 days due to the lack of solar-power, most modern [[communications satellite]]s and [[space probe]]s in the [[inner solar system]] rely on the use of solar panels to derive electricity from sunlight.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/articles/space-based-solar-power |title=Space-Based Solar Power |website=energy.gov |date=6 March 2014 |accessdate=29 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://exploringgreentechnology.com/solar-energy/history-of-solar-energy/ |title=History of Solar Energy |website=http://exploringgreentechnology.com/ |accessdate=29 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n* '''Do it yourself community'''\n\n:With a growing interest in environmentally friendly green energy, an increasing number of hobbyists in the [[Do it yourself|DIY]]-community have endeavored to build their own solar PV systems from kits<ref>[http://www.greenplanet4energy.com People building their own solar systems from kits].

Often a permit is required necessitating plan submissions and structural calculations before work may begin. Additionally, many locales require the work to be performed under the guidance of a licensed electrician. Check with the local City/County AHJ (Authority Having Jurisdiction) to ensure compliance with any applicable laws or regulations.\n\nIn the [[United States]], the [[Authority Having Jurisdiction]] (AHJ) will review designs and issue permits, before construction can lawfully begin. Electrical installation practices must comply with standards set forth within the [[National Electrical Code]] (NEC) and be inspected by the AHJ to ensure compliance with [[building code]], [[electrical code]], and [[fire safety]] code. Jurisdictions may require that equipment has been tested, certified, listed, and labeled by at least one of the [[Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories]] (NRTL). Despite the complicated installation process, a recent list of solar contractors shows a majority of installation companies were founded since 2000.<ref name=\"Solar Power World\">[http://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/top-250-solar-contractors/ Solar Power World]</ref>\n\n=== National regulations ===\n\n;United Kingdom\n\nIn the UK, PV installations are generally considered permitted development and don't require planning permission.
