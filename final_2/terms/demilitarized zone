A DMZ often lies along an established frontier or boundary between two or more military powers or alliances. A DMZ may sometimes form a ''de facto'' international border\u2014for example, the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|38th parallel between North and South Korea]]. Other examples of demilitarized zones are a {{convert|120|mi|adj=on}} area between Iraq and Kuwait, Antarctica (preserved for scientific exploration and study) and outer space (space more than {{convert|100|mi}} from the earth's surface).\n\nMany demilitarized zones are considered [[neutral territory]] because neither side is allowed to control it, even for non-combat administration. Some zones remain demilitarized after an agreement has awarded control to a state which (under the DMZ terms) had originally ceded its right to maintain military forces in the disputed territory. It is also possible for powers to agree on the demilitarization of a zone without formally settling their respective territorial claims, enabling the dispute to be resolved by peaceful means such as diplomatic dialogue or an international court.\n\nSeveral demilitarized zones have also unintentionally become [[wildlife preserve]]s because their land is unsafe for construction or less exposed to human disturbances (including hunting). Examples include the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]], the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone]], and the [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus|Green Line in Cyprus]].\n\n=={{anchor|Current demilitarized (mostly neutral) zones}}Current demilitarized zones==\n\n* [[Aegean Islands]]&nbsp;\u2013 The [[Greece|Greek]] islands of [[Chios]], [[Icaria]], [[Mytilene]], and [[Samos]] are partially demilitarized according to the [[Treaty of Lausanne]]. The Treaty forbids all naval fortifications and bases and stipulates that military forces on the islands \"be limited to the normal contingent called up for military service.\"<ref>Treaty of Lausanne, art. 13</ref>\n* [[\u00c5land Islands]]&nbsp;\u2013 The \u00c5land Convention of 1921, which was concluded following a decision of the [[League of Nations]] in response to the [[\u00c5land crisis]], mandates that the [[Finland|Finnish]] government maintain the territory as a demilitarized area.\n* [[Antarctica]]&nbsp;\u2013 The [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]] forbids military activity in Antarctica, such as \"the establishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military manoeuvres, as well as the testing of any type of weapon\". The Treaty does however provide for the \"use of military personnel or equipment for scientific research or for any other peaceful purpose\".<ref>Antarctic Treaty (1959), art. 1</ref>\n* [[Ceuta border fence]] and [[Melilla border fence]]&nbsp;\u2013 A ''de facto'' demilitarized zone exists between the Spanish territories of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] and [[Morocco]]. Perimeter fences around both cities have been constructed by Spanish and Moroccan authorities, creating a demilitarized zone between the Spanish and Moroccan fences.\n* Dniester Valley Security Zone&nbsp;\u2013 Created by the cease-fire agreement ending the [[War of Transnistria]], the [[Joint Control Commission]] peacekeeping mission monitors a demilitarized zone roughly outlining the [[Dnister]] between [[Moldova]] and [[Transnistria]].\n* Ground Safety Zone&nbsp;\u2013 A {{convert|5|km|adj=on|abbr=on}}-wide demilitarized area between [[Serbia]] and [[Kosovo]] was created under the [[Kumanovo Agreement]] following the [[Kosovo War]].\n* [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]]&nbsp;\u2013 The [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] created a 4&nbsp;km (2.5&nbsp;mi)-wide demilitarized zone between [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] following the [[Korean War]].<ref>Korean Armistice Agreement (1953), art. 1</ref> It is currently the most heavily guarded area in the world.\n* [[Kuwait\u2013Iraq barrier]]&nbsp;\u2013 The [[United Nations Security Council]] approved the creation of a demilitarized zone between [[Iraq]] and [[Kuwait]] in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 689|Resolution 689]]. Although the demilitarized zone is no longer mandated by the Council, it continues to exist.\n* [[Preah Vihear Temple]]&nbsp;\u2013 The [[International Court of Justice]] had ordered the creation of a \"provisional demilitarized zone\" around the Temple whose ownership [[Cambodian\u2013Thai border dispute|is claimed]] by both [[Cambodia]] and [[Thailand]].<ref>[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/151/16564.pdf Request for Interpretation of the Judgment of 15 June 1962 in the Case concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear (''Cambodia v.

International Court of Justice.</ref>\n* [[Sinai Peninsula]]&nbsp;\u2013 The [[Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty]] sets a limit to the amount of forces [[Egypt]] can place in the Sinai Peninsula. Parts of the peninsula are demilitarized to various degrees, especially within {{convert|20|-|40|km|abbr=off}} of [[Israel]]. Israel also agreed to limit its forces within {{convert|3|km|abbr=off}} of the Egyptian border. The areas are monitored by the [[Multinational Force and Observers]]. Because of the [[Sinai insurgency]] all sides agreed and encouraged Egypt to send large amounts of military forces into the area, including tanks and helicopters, to fight Islamist groups.\n* [[Svalbard]]&nbsp;\u2013 The [[Svalbard Treaty]] of 1920, which recognized [[Norway|Norwegian]] sovereignty over the territory, designated the area as demilitarized.\n* [[Sudan]]&nbsp;\u2013 A {{convert|6|mi|km|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} demilitarized zone along the [[Sudan]] \u2013 [[South Sudan]] border.<ref name=bbc-20110531>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-13603232 |title=Sudan agrees demilitarised zone for north-south border |publisher=BBC |date=31 May 2011 |accessdate=24 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=cnn-20130309>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/08/world/africa/sudan-south-sudan-agreement/ |title=Sudan, South Sudan agree to pull troops from demilitarized zone |author=Amir Ahmed and Greg Botelho |publisher=CNN |date=9 March 2013 |accessdate=24 October 2015}}</ref>\n* [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus]]&nbsp;\u2013 The United Nations Security Council created a buffer zone separating the self-proclaimed, internationally unrecognized [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] from the [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]]. It was authorized by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Resolution 186]] and is patrolled by the [[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus]].\n* [[United Nations Disengagement Observer Force#UNDOF Zone|United Nations Disengagement Observer Force Zone]]&nbsp;\u2013 The United Nations Security Council approved the creation of a demilitarized zone in a portion of the [[Israel]]i-[[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territory]] of the [[Golan Heights]] in [[Syria]] in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 350|Resolution 350]]. The zone is monitored by the [[United Nations Disengagement Observer Force]].\n\n==Former demilitarized zones==\n[[File:Gibraltar map.png|thumb|right|alt=Old map of the Gibraltar peninsula|Historical map of the [[promontory]] of Gibraltar.]]\n* A neutral territory was established between the British territory of [[Gibraltar]] and Spain after the end of the [[Thirteenth Siege of Gibraltar|1727 siege]]. A strip of land 600 [[toise]]s (about {{convert|1.2|km}}) long,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} more than two cannon shots' distance between the British and Spanish guns, was called \"the neutral ground\" and shown as such on older maps. In 1908, the British built a fence in a portion claimed to be the British half of the neutral territory. Spain [[Disputed status of the isthmus between Gibraltar and Spain|does not recognize]] British sovereignty over the isthmus (including the border), asserting it is Spanish soil. Although both the United Kingdom and Spain are part of the [[European Union]], the border is now a ''[[de facto]]'' international frontier with customs and immigration checks; Spain does not formally recognize it as a \"frontier\", referring to it as a \"fence\". Whatever its name, Gibraltar opted out of the [[European Union Customs Union]] and is not part of the [[Schengen Area]]; the border is open 24 hours a day, with [[customs]] duties payable on designated goods entering Spain or Gibraltar.\n*The German [[Rhineland]] was made a demilitarized zone after World War I by the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]]. It was [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|re-occupied and re-militarized]] in 1936 by [[Nazi Germany]], in violation of international treaties.\n*[[Saudi\u2013Iraqi neutral zone]], established in 1922 and partitioned in 1991\n*[[Saudi\u2013Kuwaiti neutral zone]], established in 1922 and partitioned by mutual agreement in 1970\n*Israel and Egypt:\n**Following the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], a DMZ (the [[El Auja Zone]]) was created by the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]] between Israel and Egypt.\n*Israel and Jordan:\n**The Israeli enclave and Jordanian area on [[Mount Scopus#Modern era|Mt.

In May 1933 the [[Tanggu Truce]] between China and Japan was concluded, establishing a demilitarized zone between Manchukuo and China. In 1945 after the fall of the Japanese empire, Manchuria was re-incorporated into China.\n*[[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|Vietnam]]: The demilitarized zone between North and South Vietnam was established in April 1954 as a result of the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] ending the war between the [[Viet Minh]] and the French. The DMZ in Vietnam officially lay at the [[17th parallel north|17th parallel]]; in reality, it extended about a mile on either side of the [[B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River]] and west to east from the [[Laos|Lao]] border to the [[South China Sea]].\n*Norway and Sweden established a demilitarized zone of one kilometer on each side of their border after the [[dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden]] in 1905. The zone was abolished by mutual agreement in 1993.\n*[[El Cagu\u00e1n DMZ]] was established in southern [[Colombia]] between 1999 and 2002, during the failed [[1999\u20132002 FARC\u2013Government peace process|peace process]] that involved the Government of [[President of Colombia|President]] [[Andr\u00e9s Pastrana]] and the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Green Zone|Green zone]]\n* [[No-fly zone]]\n* [[UNIKOM]]\n* [[DMZ (computing)]]\n* [[Buffer Zone]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2012}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Demilitarized Zone}}\n[[Category:Military terminology]]\n[[Category:Demilitarized zones| ]]"}]}}}}
