The term is also widely used in [[photovoltaics]] to describe an unwanted short circuit between the front and back surface contacts of a [[solar cell]], usually caused by [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]] damage. The origin of the term is in the verb 'to shunt' meaning to turn away or follow a different path.\n\n{{Wiktionary|shunt}}\n\n==Defective device bypass==\n\nOne example is in miniature [[Christmas lights (holiday decoration)|Christmas lights]] which are [[series circuit|wired in series]].  When the [[Electrical filament|filament]] burns out in one of the [[incandescent light bulb]]s, the [[electrical resistance]] becomes very high.  The much higher [[voltage]] that this creates (equal to the full line voltage rather than the normal [[voltage divider]] level) causes the shunt to short out (becoming an [[antifuse]]) and become part of the circuit, again allowing electricity to pass and the set to light. If too many lights burn out however, a shunt will also burn out, requiring the use of a [[multimeter]] to find the point of failure.\n\n==Lightning arrestor==\n\nA [[gas]]-filled tube can also be used as a shunt, particularly in a [[lightning arrestor]].  [[Neon]] and other [[noble gas]]es have a high [[breakdown voltage]], so that normally current will not flow across it.  However, a direct [[lightning]] strike (such as on a [[radio masts and towers|radio tower]] [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]) will cause the shunt to [[electric arc|arc]] and conduct the massive amount of electricity to [[ground (electricity)|ground]], protecting [[transmitter]]s and other equipment.\n\nAnother older form of lightning arrestor employs a simple narrow spark gap, over which an arc will jump when a high voltage is present. While this is a low cost solution, its high triggering voltage offers almost no protection for modern solid-state electronic devices powered by the protected circuit.\n\n==Electrical noise bypass==\n\n[[Capacitor]]s are used as shunts to redirect high-frequency noise to ground before it can propagate to the load or other circuit components.\n\n==Use in electronic filter circuits==\nThe term shunt is used in [[Electronic filter|filter]] and similar circuits with a [[Ladder network|ladder topology]] to refer to the components connected between the line and common.  The term is used in this context to distinguish the shunt connected components from the series connected components in parallel with the line.  More generally, the term shunt can be used for a component connected in parallel with another.  For instance, ''shunt [[M-derived filters|m-derived]] half section'' is a common filter section from the [[image impedance]] method of filter design.<ref>Matthaei, Young, Jones ''Microwave Filters, Impedance-Matching Networks, and Coupling Structures'', p66, McGraw-Hill 1964</ref>\n\n==Diodes as shunts==\n\nWhere devices are especially sensitive to reverse polarity of signal or power supply, a [[diode]] may be used to protect the circuit. If connected in series with the circuit it simply prevents reversed current, but if connected in parallel it can shunt the reversed supply, causing a fuse or other current limiting circuit to open.\n\n==Shunts as circuit protection==\n\nWhen a circuit must be protected from overvoltage and there are failure modes in the power supply that can produce such overvoltages, the circuit may be protected by a device commonly called a [[Crowbar (circuit)|crowbar circuit]]. When this device detects an overvoltage it causes a short circuit between the power supply and its return. This will cause both an immediate drop in voltage (protecting the device) and an instantaneous high current which is expected to open a current sensitive device (such as a [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]] or [[circuit breaker]]). This device is called a ''crowbar'' as it is likened to dropping an actual [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] across a set of [[bus bar]]s (exposed electrical conductors).\n\n==Use in current measuring==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Ammeter]] -->\n[[Image:Shuntresistor50A.jpg|right|thumb|200px|50&nbsp;A shunt resistor]]\nAn [[ammeter]] shunt allows the measurement of [[electrical current|current]] values too large to be directly measured by a particular ammeter. In this case the '''shunt''', a [[manganin]] [[resistor]] of accurately known [[electrical resistance|resistance]], is placed in series with the load, thus all of the current to be measured will flow through it. In order not to disrupt the [[electrical circuit|circuit]], the resistance of the shunt is normally very small. The [[voltage]] drop across the shunt is proportional to the current flowing through it and since its resistance is known, a [[voltmeter]] connected across the shunt can be scaled to directly display the current value.\n\nShunts are rated by maximum current and voltage drop at that current. For example, a 500&nbsp;A, 75&nbsp;mV shunt would have a resistance of 0.15 [[ohm|milliohm]]s, a maximum allowable current of 500 [[ampere|amp]]s and at that current the [[voltage]] drop would be 75 [[millivolt]]s. By convention, most shunts are designed to drop 50&nbsp;mV, 75&nbsp;mV or 100&nbsp;mV when operating at their full rated current and most ammeters consist of a shunt and a voltmeter with full-scale deflections of 50, 75, or 100&nbsp;mV. All shunts have a derating factor for continuous use, 66% being the most common. Continuous use is a run time of 2+ minutes, at which point the derating factor must be applied. There are thermal limits where a shunt will no longer operate correctly.  At 80&nbsp;\u00b0C thermal drift begins to occur, at 120&nbsp;\u00b0C thermal drift is a significant problem where error, depending on the design of the shunt, can be several percent and at 140&nbsp;\u00b0C the manganin alloy becomes permanently damaged due to [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] resulting in the resistance value drifting up or down. \n \nIf the current being measured is also at a high voltage potential this voltage will be present in the connecting leads to and in the reading instrument itself. Sometimes, the shunt is inserted in the return leg ([[Ground (electricity)|grounded]] side) to avoid this problem. Some alternatives to shunts can provide isolation from the high voltage by not directly connecting the meter to the high voltage circuit. Examples of devices that can provide this isolation are [[Hall effect]] current sensors and [[current transformer]]s (see [[clamp meter]]s). Current shunts are considered more accurate and cheaper than Hall effect devices. Common [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]] of such devices are \u00b10.1% & 0.25% and 0.5%. \n\nThe Thomas-type double manganin walled shunt and MI type (improved Thomas-type design) were used until the 1990s by NIST and other government labs as the legal reference of an ohm until the advent of the [[quantum Hall effect]].  Thomas-type shunts are still used by government and private labs to take very accurate current measurements, as using quantum Hall effect is a time consuming process.  The accuracy of these types of shunts is measured in the ppm and sub-ppm scale of drift per year of set resistance.\n\n===Current measurement techniques===\n\n[[Image:low side current shunt.gif|thumb|Low-side insertion can eliminate common mode voltage, but not without drawbacks.]]\n[[File:High side current shunt diagram.svg|thumb|High-side insertion resolves low-side drawbacks, but guarantees common mode voltage.]]\n\nWhere the circuit is grounded (earthed) on one side, a current measuring shunt can be inserted either in the ungrounded conductor or in the grounded conductor. A shunt in the ungrounded conductor must be insulated for the full circuit voltage to ground; the measuring instrument must be inherently isolated from ground or must include a resistive voltage divider or an [[isolation amplifier]]  between the relatively high common-mode voltage and lower voltages inside the instrument. A shunt in the grounded conductor may not detect leakage current that bypasses the shunt, but it will not experience high common-mode voltage to ground.  The load is removed from a direct path to ground, which may create problems for control circuitry, result in unwanted emissions, or both.\n \n[[Image:isolation amp current shunt.gif|thumb|right|[[isolation amplifier|Isolated amplifiers]] resolve all the difficulties and limitations with high- or low-side current shunt measurements.]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Shunt generator]]\n* [[Shunt wound motor]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.phy.hk/wiki/englishhtm/Meter.htm Java applet of using shunts or multipliers in an electric meter]\n\n[[Category:Electrical engineering]]"}]}}}}
