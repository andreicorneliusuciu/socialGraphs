June 1962.]]\nA '''functional block diagram''' in [[systems engineering]] and [[software engineering]] is a [[block diagram]]. It describes the functions and interrelationships of a [[system]]. \n\nThe functional block diagram can picture:<ref>James Perozzo (1994) ''The complete guide to electronics troubleshooting''. p. 72</ref>\n* Functions of a system pictured by blocks  \n* input and output elements of a block pictured with lines \n* the relationships between the functions, and \n* the functional sequences and paths for matter and or signals<ref>William H. Von Alven (1964) ''Reliability engineering'' explains: \"Functional block diagrams show functional sequences and signal paths, and items which are wired in parallel are drawn in parallel\" (p. 286)</ref>\nThe block diagram can use additional schematic symbols to show particular properties. \n\nFunctional block diagrams have been used in a wide range applications, from [[systems engineering]] to [[software engineering]], since the late 1950s. They became a necessity in complex systems design to \"understand thoroughly from exterior design the operation of the present system and the relationship of each of the parts to the whole.\"<ref>[[Harry H. Goode]], [[Robert Engel Machol]] (1957) System engineering: an introduction to the design of large-scale systems. p. 306</ref> \n\nMany specific types of functional block diagrams have emerged. For example, the [[functional flow block diagram]] is a combination of the functional block diagram and the [[flow chart]]. Many software development methodologies are built with specific functional block diagram techniques. An example from the field of industrial computing is the [[Function Block Diagram]] (FBD), a graphical language for the design of [[programmable logic controller]]s.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Function model]]\n* [[Functional flow block diagram]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Functional block diagrams}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Functional block diagram}}\n[[Category:Diagrams]]\n[[Category:Systems engineering]]"}]}}}}
