It can refer to a [[television set]], a [[television program]] (\"TV show\"), or the medium of [[Transmission (telecommunications)|television transmission]]. Television is a [[mass medium]], for [[entertainment]], [[educational television|education]], [[news]], and [[advertising]].\n\nTelevision became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but these did not sell to the public. After [[World War II]], an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing [[public opinion]].<ref name=\"Diggs-Brown2011p53\">Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p.48</ref> In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries. The availability of storage media such as [[Betamax]] (1975), [[VHS]] tape (1976), [[DVD]]s (1997), and high-definition [[Blu-ray Disc]]s (2006) enabled viewers to watch prerecorded material at home, such as [[movie]]s. At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, [[digital television]] transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) ([[576i]], with 576 [[Interlacing|interlaced]] lines of resolution and [[480i]]) to [[high-definition television]] (HDTV), which provides a [[Image resolution|resolution]] that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in various formats: [[1080p]], [[1080i]] and [[720p]]. Since 2010, with the invention of [[smart television]], [[Internet television]] has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the [[Internet]] through [[streaming video]] services such as [[Netflix]], [[iPlayer]], [[Hulu]], [[Roku]] and [[Chromecast]].\n\nIn 2013, 79% of the world's [[households]] owned a television set.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/opinions/0087/the-state-of-television-worldwide/222681|title=TVTechnology: The State of Television, Worldwide|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> The replacement of early bulky, high-voltage [[Cathode ray tube|cathode ray tube (CRT)]] screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as [[plasma display]]s, [[LCD]]s (both [[Cold cathode#Lamps|fluorescent-backlit]] and [[LED-backlit LCD display|LED]]), and [[OLED]] displays was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s.

Alternatively television signals are distributed by [[Cable television|coaxial cable or optical fiber]], [[Satellite television|satellite]] systems and, since the 2000s via the [[Internet television|Internet]]. Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as [[analog television|analog]] signals but countries started switching to digital, this [[Digital television transition|transition]] is expected to be completed worldwide by late 2010s. A standard television set is composed of multiple internal [[electronic circuit]]s, including a tuner for [[Tuner (electronics)|receiving]] and decoding broadcast signals. A visual [[display device]] which lacks a [[tuner (television)|tuner]] is correctly called a [[video monitor]] rather than a television.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''television'' comes {{ety|grc|''\u03c4\u1fc6\u03bb\u03b5'' (t\u00e8le)|far|lat|visio|sight}}. The first documented usage of the term dates back to 1900, when a Russian scientist [[Constantin Perskyi]] used it in a paper that he presented in French at the 1st International Congress of Electricity, which ran from 18 to 25 August 1900 during the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|International World Fair]] in [[Paris]].

[[Frederick Bakewell]] demonstrated a working laboratory version in 1851.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Willoughby Smith]] discovered the [[photoconductivity]] of the element [[selenium]] in 1873. As a 23-year-old German university student, [[Paul Nipkow|Paul Julius Gottlieb Nipkow]] proposed and patented the [[Nipkow disk]] in 1884.<ref>Shiers, George and May (1997), ''Early Television: A Bibliographic Guide to 1940''.

Fournier in Paris in 1909. A matrix of 64 [[selenium]] cells, individually wired to a mechanical [[commutator (electric)|commutator]], served as an electronic [[retina]]. In the receiver, a type of [[Kerr effect|Kerr cell]] modulated the light and a series of variously angled mirrors attached to the edge of a rotating disc scanned the modulated beam onto the display screen. A separate circuit regulated synchronization. The 8x8 [[pixel]] resolution in this proof-of-concept demonstration was just sufficient to clearly transmit individual letters of the alphabet. An updated image was transmitted \"several times\" each second.<ref>Henry de Varigny, \"[http://histv2.free.fr/rignoux/rignoux1909.htm La vision \u00e0 distance]\", ''L'Illustration'', Paris, 11 December 1909, p. 451.</ref> In 1921 [[Edouard Belin]] sent the first image via radio waves with his [[belinograph]].\n\nIn 1911, [[Boris Rosing]] and his student [[Vladimir Zworykin]] created a system that used a mechanical mirror-drum scanner to transmit, in Zworykin's words, \"very crude images\" over wires to the \"[[Karl Ferdinand Braun|Braun]] tube\" ([[cathode ray tube]] or \"CRT\") in the receiver.

On 25 March 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised [[silhouette]] images in motion, at [[Selfridges|Selfridge's]] Department Store in London.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v115/n2892/pdf/115504a0.pdf \"Current Topics and Events\"], ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', vol. 115, 4 April 1925, p. 505\u2013506, {{doi|10.1038/115504a0}}.</ref>  Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a ventriloquist's dummy named \"Stooky Bill\", whose painted face had higher contrast, talking and moving. By 26 January 1926, he demonstrated the transmission of the image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as the first television demonstration. The subject was Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson. Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. A bright light shining through a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses projected a bright spot of light which swept across the subject. A Selenium [[Phototube|photoelectric tube]] detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal.  This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one [[scan line]] of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face. In 1927, Baird transmitted a signal over {{convert|438|mi|km}} of telephone line between London and [[Glasgow]].\n\nIn 1928, Baird's company (Baird Television Development Company/Cinema Television) broadcast the first transatlantic television signal, between London and New York, and the first shore-to-ship transmission. In 1929, he became involved in the first experimental mechanical television service in Germany. In November of the same year, Baird and [[Bernard Natan]] of [[Path\u00e9]] established France's first television company, T\u00e9l\u00e9vision-[[John Logie Baird|Baird]]-Natan. In 1931, he made the first outdoor remote broadcast, of the [[Epsom Derby]].<ref>J. L. Baird, \"[http://www.bairdtelevision.com/1932.html Television in 1932]\", ''BBC Annual Report'', 1933.</ref> In 1932, he demonstrated [[ultra-short wave]] television. Baird's mechanical system reached a peak of 240-lines of resolution on [[BBC]] television broadcasts in 1936, though the mechanical system did not scan the televised scene directly. Instead a [[17.5mm film]] was shot, rapidly developed and then scanned while the film was still wet.\n\nAn American inventor, [[Charles Francis Jenkins]], also pioneered the television. He published an article on \"Motion Pictures by Wireless\" in 1913, but it was not until December 1923 that he transmitted moving silhouette images for witnesses; and it was on 13 June 1925, that he publicly demonstrated synchronized transmission of silhouette pictures. In 1925 Jenkins used the [[Nipkow disk]] and transmitted the silhouette image of a toy windmill in motion, over a distance of five miles, from a naval radio station in Maryland to his laboratory in Washington, D.C., using a lensed disk scanner with a 48-line resolution.<ref>\"Radio Shows Far Away Objects in Motion\", ''The New York Times'', 14 June 1925, p. 1.</ref><ref name=\"glinsky\">{{cite book| last = Glinsky| first = Albert| title = Theremin: Ether Music and Espionage| location = Urbana, Illinois| publisher = University of Illinois Press| year = 2000| pages = 41\u201345| isbn = 0-252-02582-2}}</ref> He was granted [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent]] No. 1,544,156 (Transmitting Pictures over Wireless) on 30 June 1925 (filed 13 March 1922).\n\n[[Herbert E. Ives]] and [[Frank Gray (researcher)|Frank Gray]] of [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] gave a dramatic demonstration of mechanical television on 7 April 1927. Their reflected-light television system included both small and large viewing screens. The small receiver had a 2-inch-wide by 2.5-inch-high screen. The large receiver had a screen 24&nbsp;inches wide by 30&nbsp;inches high. Both sets were capable of reproducing reasonably accurate, monochromatic, moving images. Along with the pictures, the sets received synchronized sound. The system transmitted images over two paths: first, a [[copper wire]] link from Washington to New York City, then a radio link from [[Whippany, New Jersey]]. Comparing the two transmission methods, viewers noted no difference in quality. Subjects of the telecast included [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]]. A [[flying-spot scanner]] beam illuminated these subjects. The scanner that produced the beam had a 50-aperture disk. The disc revolved at a rate of 18 frames per second, capturing one frame about every 56 [[millisecond]]s. (Today's systems typically transmit 30 or 60 frames per second, or one frame every 33.3 or 16.7 milliseconds respectively.) Television historian Albert Abramson underscored the significance of the Bell Labs demonstration: \"It was in fact the best demonstration of a mechanical television system ever made to this time. It would be several years before any other system could even begin to compare with it in picture quality.\"<ref>Abramson, Albert, ''The History of Television, 1880 to 1941'', McFarland & Co., Inc., 1987, p. 101.

Meanwhile, in the [[Soviet Union]], [[L\u00e9on Theremin]] had been developing a mirror drum-based television, starting with 16 lines resolution in 1925, then 32 lines and eventually 64 using [[interlacing]] in 1926.

Previous color television demonstrations in the U.K. and U.S. had been via closed circuit.</ref> Mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by [[Bell Laboratories]] in June 1929 using three complete systems of [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]], amplifiers, glow-tubes, and color filters, with a series of mirrors to superimpose the red, green, and blue images into one full color image.\n\nThe first practical hybrid system was again pioneered by John Logie Baird. In 1940 he publicly demonstrated a color television combining a traditional black-and-white display with a rotating colored disk. This device was very \"deep\", but was later improved with a mirror folding the light path into an entirely practical device resembling a large conventional console.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html|title=The World's First High Definition Colour Television System|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> However, Baird was not happy with the design, and, as early as 1944, had commented to a British government committee that a fully electronic device would be better.\n\nIn 1939, Hungarian engineer [[Peter Carl Goldmark]] introduced an electro-mechanical system while at [[CBS]], which contained an [[Iconoscope]] sensor. The CBS field-sequential color system was partly mechanical, with a disc made of red, blue, and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 rpm, and a similar disc spinning in synchronization in front of the cathode ray tube inside the receiver set.<ref>Peter C.

The [[War Production Board]] halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from 22 April 1942 to 20 August 1945, limiting any opportunity to introduce color television to the general public.<ref>\"Making of Radios and Phonographs to End April 22,\" ''New York Times'', 8 March 1942, p. 1. \"Radio Production Curbs Cover All Combinations,\" ''Wall Street Journal'', 3 June 1942, p. 4. \"WPB Cancels 210 Controls; Radios, Trucks in Full Output,\" ''New York Times'', 21 August 1945, p. 1.</ref><ref>Bob Cooper, \"[http://www.earlytelevision.org/color_tv_cooper.html Television: The Technology That Changed Our Lives]\", Early Television Foundation.</ref>\n\nAs early as 1940, Baird had started work on a fully electronic system he called [[Telechrome]]. Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate. The phosphor was patterned so the electrons from the guns only fell on one side of the patterning or the other. Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-color image could be obtained. He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image (called \"[[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]]\" at the time). A demonstration on 16 August 1944 was the first example of a practical color television system. Work on the Telechrome continued and plans were made to introduce a three-gun version for full color. However, Baird's untimely death in 1946 ended development of the Telechrome system.<ref>Albert Abramson, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000'', McFarland & Company, 2003, pp. 13\u201314. ISBN 0-7864-1220-8</ref><ref>Baird Television: [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html The World's First High Definition Colour Television System].</ref>\nSimilar concepts were common through the 1940s and 1950s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns. The [[Geer tube]] was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface. The [[Penetron]] used three layers of phosphor on top of each other and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors. The [[Chromatron]] used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube.\n\nOne of the great technical challenges of introducing color [[broadcast television]] was the desire to conserve [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], potentially three times that of the existing [[black-and-white]] standards, and not use an excessive amount of [[radio spectrum]]. In the United States, after considerable research, the [[NTSC|National Television Systems Committee]]<ref name=name>National Television System Committee (1951\u20131953), [Report and Reports of Panel No. 11, 11-A, 12\u201319, with Some supplementary references cited in the Reports, and the Petition for adoption of transmission standards for color television before the Federal Communications Commission, n.p., 1953], 17 v. illus., diagrams., tables. 28 cm. LC Control No.:54021386 [http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=First Library of Congress Online Catalog]</ref> approved an all-electronic [[Compatible color]] system developed by [[RCA]], which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth. The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display. The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the brain to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image. The NTSC standard represented a major technical achievement.\n\n[[File:SMPTE Color Bars.svg|thumb|left|Color bars used in a [[test pattern]], sometimes used when no program material is available.]]\nAlthough all-electronic color was introduced in the U.S. in 1953,<ref>{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Jeremy G.|title=Television: Critical Methods and Applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7rWFRLVyvY0C&pg=PA290&dq=color+television+December+17+1953&hl=en&sa=X&ei=XpTGUdq5JO_A4APivoCoDA&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=color%20television%20December%2017%201953&f=false |year=2006 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=9781410614742 |page=290}}</ref> high prices, and the scarcity of color programming, greatly slowed its acceptance in the marketplace. The first national color broadcast (the 1954 [[Tournament of Roses Parade]]) occurred on 1 January 1954, but during the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that fall. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later. In 1972, the last holdout among daytime network programs converted to color, resulting in the first completely all-color network season.\n\nEarly color sets were either floor-standing console models or tabletop versions nearly as bulky and heavy; so in practice they remained firmly anchored in one place. The introduction of [[General Electric|GE's]] relatively compact and lightweight [[Porta-Color]] set in the spring of 1966 made watching color television a more flexible and convenient proposition. In 1972, sales of color sets finally surpassed sales of black-and-white sets. Color broadcasting in Europe was not standardized on the [[PAL]] format until the 1960s, and broadcasts did not start until 1967. By this point many of the technical problems in the early sets had been worked out, and the spread of color sets in Europe was fairly rapid. By the mid-1970s, the only stations broadcasting in black-and-white were a few high-numbered UHF stations in small markets, and a handful of low-power repeater stations in even smaller markets such as vacation spots. By 1979, even the last of these had converted to color and, by the early 1980s, B&W sets had been pushed into niche markets, notably low-power uses, small portable sets, or for use as [[video monitor]] screens in lower-cost consumer equipment. By late 1980's even these areas switched to color sets.\n\n===Digital===\n{{main article|Digital television}}\n{{see also|Digital television transition}}\n\nDigital television (DTV) is the transmission of audio and video by digitally processed and multiplexed signals, in contrast to the totally analog and channel separated signals used by [[analog television]]. Digital TV can support more than one program in the same channel bandwidth.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.disabled-world.com/artman/publish/digital-hdtv.shtml | title=HDTV Set Top Boxes and Digital TV Broadcast Information | accessdate=28 June 2014}}</ref> It is an innovative service that represents the first significant evolution in television technology since color television in the 1950s.<ref>Kruger, L. G. (2001). Digital Television: An Overview. Hauppauge, New York: Nova Publishers.</ref> Digital TV's roots have been tied very closely to the availability of inexpensive, high performance computers. It was not until the 1990s that digital TV became feasible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.benton.org/initiatives/obligations/charting_the_digital_broadcasting_future/sec1|title=The Origins and Future Prospects of Digital Television|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, as Japanese consumer electronics firms forged ahead with the development of [[High-definition television|HDTV]] technology, the [[Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding|MUSE]] analog format proposed by [[NHK]], a Japanese company, was seen as a pacesetter that threatened to eclipse U.S. electronics companies' technologies. Until June 1990, the Japanese MUSE standard, based on an analog system, was the front-runner among the more than 23 different technical concepts under consideration. Then, an American company, General Instrument, demonstrated the feasibility of a digital television signal. This breakthrough was of such significance that the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] was persuaded to delay its decision on an ATV standard until a digitally based standard could be developed.\n\nIn March 1990, when it became clear that a digital standard was feasible, the FCC made a number of critical decisions. First, the Commission declared that the new ATV standard must be more than an enhanced analog signal, but be able to provide a genuine HDTV signal with at least twice the resolution of existing television images.(7) Then, to ensure that viewers who did not wish to buy a new digital television set could continue to receive conventional television broadcasts, it dictated that the new ATV standard must be capable of being \"[[simulcast]]\" on different channels.(8)The new ATV standard also allowed the new DTV signal to be based on entirely new design principles. Although incompatible with the existing [[NTSC]] standard, the new DTV standard would be able to incorporate many improvements.\n\nThe final standards adopted by the FCC did not require a single standard for scanning formats, [[aspect ratios]], or lines of resolution. This compromise resulted from a dispute between the consumer electronics industry (joined by some broadcasters) and the computer industry (joined by the film industry and some public interest groups) over which of the two scanning processes\u2014interlaced or progressive\u2014would be best suited for the newer digital HDTV compatible display devices.<ref name=\"bambooav.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bambooav.com/information-about-interlaced-and-progressive-scan-signals.html|title=Information about interlaced and progressive scan signals|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> Interlaced scanning, which had been specifically designed for older analogue CRT display technologies, scans even-numbered lines first, then odd-numbered ones. In fact, interlaced scanning can be looked at as the first video compression model as it was partly designed in the 1940s to double the image resolution to exceed the limitations of the television broadcast bandwidth.  Another reason for its adoption was to limit the flickering on early CRT screens whose phosphor coated screens could only retain the image from the electron scanning gun for a relatively short duration.<ref>[http://www.isfforum.com/FAQs/view/All-About-HDTV/What-s-the-Difference-between-Interlaced-and-Progressive-Video/33.html What's the Difference between \"Interlaced\" and \"Progressive\" Video? \u2013 ISF Forum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However interlaced scanning does not work as efficiently on newer display devices such as [[Lcd|Liquid-crystal (LCD)]], for example, which are better suited to a more frequent progressive refresh rate.<ref name=\"bambooav.com\"/>\n\n[[Progressive scanning]], the format that the computer industry had long adopted for computer display monitors, scans every line in sequence, from top to bottom. Progressive scanning in effect doubles the amount of data generated for every full screen displayed in comparison to interlaced scanning by painting the screen in one pass in 1/60 second, instead of two passes in 1/30 second. The computer industry argued that progressive scanning is superior because it does not \"flicker\" on the new standard of display devices in the manner of interlaced scanning. It also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with the Internet, and is more cheaply converted to interlaced formats than vice versa. The film industry also supported progressive scanning because it offered a more efficient means of converting filmed programming into digital formats. For their part, the consumer electronics industry and broadcasters argued that interlaced scanning was the only technology that could transmit the highest quality pictures then (and currently) feasible, i.e., 1,080 lines per picture and 1,920 pixels per line. Broadcasters also favored interlaced scanning because their vast archive of interlaced programming is not readily compatible with a progressive format. [[William F. Schreiber]], who was director of the Advanced Television Research Program at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] from 1983 until his retirement in 1990, thought that the continued advocacy of interlaced equipment originated from consumer electronics companies that were trying to get back the substantial investments they made in the interlaced technology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemasource.com/articles/hist_politics_dtv.pdf|title=The history and politics of DTV|page=13}}</ref>\n\n[[Digital television transition]] started in late 2000s. All governments across the world set the deadline for analog shutdown by 2010s. Initially the adoption rate was low, as the first digital tuner-equipped TVs were costly. But soon, as the price of digital-capable TVs dropped, more and more households were converting to digital televisions. The transition is expected to be completed worldwide by mid to late 2010s.\n\n===Smart TV===\n{{main article|Smart television}}\n{{Distinguish|Internet television|Internet Protocol television|Web television}}\n[[File:LG smart TV.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A smart TV]]\nThe advent of digital television allowed innovations like smart TVs.

At first, [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial broadcasting]] was the only way television could be widely distributed, and because [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] was limited, i.e., there were only a small number of [[Television channel|channels]] available, government regulation was the norm. In the U.S., the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) allowed stations to broadcast advertisements beginning in July 1941, but required public service programming commitments as a requirement for a license. By contrast, the United Kingdom chose a different route, imposing a [[television license]] fee on owners of television reception equipment to fund the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC), which had public service as part of its [[Royal Charter]].\n\n[[WRGB]] claims to be the world's oldest television station, tracing its roots to an experimental station founded on 13 January 1928, broadcasting from the [[General Electric]] factory in [[Schenectady, NY]], under the call letters '''W2XB'''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iuIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA177&dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&hl=en&ei=F1pgTsXYNInUgQfhoo2PAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&sqi=2&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=true \"The First Television Show\" ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1930, pp. 177\u2013179]</ref> It was popularly known as \"WGY Television\" after its sister radio station. Later in 1928, General Electric started a second facility, this one in New York City, which had the call letters [[W2XBS]] and which today is known as [[WNBC]]. The two stations were experimental in nature and had no regular programming, as receivers were operated by engineers within the company. The image of a [[Felix the Cat]] doll rotating on a turntable was broadcast for 2 hours every day for several years as new technology was being tested by the engineers. On 2 November 1936, the [[BBC]] began transmitting the world's first public regular high-definition service from the Victorian [[Alexandra Palace]] in north London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teletronic.co.uk/tvera.htm|title=THE HISTORY OF THE BBC: THE FIRST TV ERA|author=laurence marcus|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> It therefore claims to be the birthplace of TV broadcasting as we know it today.\n\nWith the widespread adoption of cable across the United States in the 1970s and 80s, terrestrial television broadcasts have been in decline; in 2013 it was estimated that about 7% of US households used an antenna.<ref>[http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/cea-study-says-seven-percent-of-tv-households-use-antennas-/220585 \"CEA Study Says Seven Percent of TV Households Use Antennas\"], '\"TVTechnology'', 30 July 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/nielsen-broadcast-reliance-grew-in--/217217 \"Nielsen: Broadcast Reliance Grew in 2012\"], ''TVTechnology'', 14 January 2013</ref> A slight increase in use began around 2010 due to switchover to [[digital terrestrial television]] broadcasts, which offered pristine image quality over very large areas, and offered an alternate to [[cable television]] (CATV) for [[cord cutters]].

This contrasts with traditional terrestrial television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. In the 2000s, FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone service, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables. The abbreviation CATV is often used for cable television. It originally stood for Community Access Television or Community Antenna Television, from cable television's origins in 1948: in areas where over-the-air reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, large \"community antennas\" were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.calcable.org/learn/history-of-cable/ | title=History of Cable | publisher=California Cable and Telecommunications Association | accessdate=20 February 2016}}</ref> The origins of cable broadcasting are even older as radio programming was distributed by cable in some European cities as far back as 1924.

The signals are received via an outdoor parabolic reflector antenna usually referred to as a [[satellite dish]] and a [[low-noise block downconverter]] (LNB). A satellite receiver then decodes the desired [[television program]] for viewing on a [[television set]]. Receivers can be external [[set-top box]]es, or a built-in [[tuner (television)|television tuner]]. Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services, especially to geographic areas without [[terrestrial television]] or [[cable television]].\n\nThe most common method of reception is [[direct-broadcast satellite television]] (DBSTV), also known as \"direct to home\" (DTH).<ref name=\"tr101198\">{{Cite report|author=Antipolis, Sophia|date=September 1997|title=Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Implementation of Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation in DVB satellite transmission systems|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/101100_101199/101198/01.01.01_60/tr_101198v010101p.pdf|publisher=[[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]|pages=1\u20137|docket=TR 101 198|accessdate=20 July 2014|quote=}}</ref> In DBSTV systems, signals are relayed from a [[direct broadcast satellite]] on the [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>]] wavelength and are completely digital.<ref name=m101>{{cite journal |title=Frequency letter bands|url=http://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedia/letterbands.cfm|journal=Microwaves101.com|date = 25 April 2008}}</ref> Satellite TV systems formerly used systems known as [[television receive-only]].

Internet television is a general term that covers the delivery of television shows, and other video content, over the Internet by video streaming technology, typically by major traditional television broadcasters. Internet television should not to be confused with [[Smart TV]], [[IPTV]] or with [[Web TV]]. [[Smart television]] refers to the TV set which has a built-in operating system.

They are called \"[[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]\" displays because the technology utilizes small cells containing [[electrically]] [[electric charge|charged]] [[ionized]] [[gases]], or what are in essence chambers more commonly known as [[fluorescent lamp]]s.\n{{Clear}}\n\n====LCD====\n{{main article|Liquid crystal display}}\n[[File:LCD generic tv.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A generic LCD TV, with speakers on either side of the screen.]]\nLiquid-crystal-display televisions (LCD TV) are television sets that use [[LCD]] [[display technology]] to produce images. LCD televisions are much thinner and lighter than [[cathode ray tube]] (CRTs) of similar display size, and are available in much larger sizes (e.g., 90 inch diagonal). When manufacturing costs fell, this combination of features made LCDs practical for television receivers. LCD's come in two types: those using [[cold cathode|cold cathode fluorescent lamps]], simply called LCDs and those using [[LED]] as backlight called as [[LED-backlit LCD television|LEDs]].\n\nIn 2007, LCD televisions surpassed sales of CRT-based televisions worldwide for the first time, and their sales figures relative to other technologies accelerated. LCD TVs have quickly displaced the only major competitors in the large-screen market, the [[Plasma display|plasma display panel]] and [[rear-projection television]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dailytech.com/Report+Shipments+of+LCD+TVs+Surpass+CRT+TVs/article10775.htm | title=Hardware Report: Shipments of LCD TVs Surpass CRT TVs | publisher=DailyTech LLC. | accessdate=20 February 2016}}</ref> In mid 2010s LCDs especially LEDs became, by far, the most widely produced and sold television display type.<ref name=\"Displaysearch.com\" /><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> LCDs also have disadvantages. Other technologies address these weaknesses, including [[organic light-emitting diode|OLEDs]], [[Field emission display|FED]] and [[Surface-conduction electron-emitter display|SED]], but {{as of|2014|lc=on}} none of these have entered widespread production.\n\n====OLED====\n{{main article|Organic light-emitting diode}}\n[[File:LG\uc804\uc790, \uae5c\ube61\uc784 \uc5c6\ub294 55\uc778\uce58 3D OLED TV \uacf5\uac1c(2).jpg|thumb|left|OLED TV]]\n\nAn OLED (organic light-emitting diode) is a [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) in which the [[emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emissive]] [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] layer is a film of [[organic compound]] which emits light in response to an electric current.  This layer of [[organic semiconductor]] is situated between two electrodes. Generally, at least one of these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create [[digital display]]s in devices such as [[television set|television]] screens. It is also used for computer monitors, portable systems such as [[mobile phones]], [[handheld games console]]s and [[personal digital assistant|PDAs]].\n\nThere are two main families of OLED: those based on small [[molecule]]s and those employing [[polymer]]s. Adding mobile [[ion]]s to an OLED creates a [[light-emitting electrochemical cell]] or LEC, which has a slightly different mode of operation. OLED displays can use either [[Passive matrix addressing|passive-matrix]] (PMOLED) or [[Active matrix addressing|active-matrix]] (AMOLED) addressing schemes. Active-matrix OLEDs require a [[thin-film transistor]] backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off, but allow for higher resolution and larger display sizes.\n\nAn OLED display works without a [[backlight]]. Thus, it can display deep [[black level]]s and can be thinner and lighter than a [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD). In low ambient light conditions such as a dark room an OLED screen can achieve a higher [[contrast ratio]] than an LCD, whether the LCD uses [[cold cathode|cold cathode fluorescent lamps]] or [[LED-backlit LCD television|LED backlight]].\n\nOLEDs are expected to replace other forms of display in near future.<ref name=\"oled-info.com\"/>\n\n===Display resolution===\n[[File:8K UHD, 4K SHD, FHD and SD.svg|300px|right|thumb|Comparison of 8K UHDTV, 4K UHDTV, [[High-definition television|HDTV]] and [[Standard-definition television|SDTV]] resolution]]\n\n====LD====\n{{main article|Low-definition television}}\n\nLow-definition television or LDTV refers to television systems that have a lower screen resolution than standard-definition television systems such [[240p]] (320*240). It is used in [[handheld television]]. The most common source of LDTV programming is the [[Internet]], where mass distribution of higher-resolution [[video file]]s could overwhelm [[computer server]]s and take too long to [[download]]. Many [[mobile phone]]s and portable devices such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]\u2019s [[iPod Nano]], or Sony\u2019s [[PlayStation Portable]] use LDTV video, as higher-resolution files would be excessive to the needs of their small screens ([[QVGA|320\u00d7240]] and 480\u00d7272 [[pixel]]s respectively). The current generation of iPod Nanos have LDTV screens, as do the first three generations of [[iPod Touch]] and [[iPhone]] (480\u00d7320). For the first years of its existence, [[YouTube]] offered only one, low-definition resolution of 320x240p at 30fps or less. A standard, consumer grade [[VHS]] [[videotape]] can be considered SDTV due to its resolution (approximately 360 \u00d7 480i/576i).\n\n====SD====\n{{main article|Standard-definition television}}\n\nStandard-definition television or SDTV refers to two different resolutions: [[576i]], with 576 [[Interlacing|interlaced]] lines of resolution, derived from the European-developed [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] systems; and [[480i]] based on the American National Television System Committee [[NTSC]] system. SDTV is a television system that uses a resolution that is not considered to be either [[high-definition television]] ([[720p]], [[1080i]], [[1080p]], [[1440p]], [[4K UHDTV]], and [[8K UHD]]) or [[enhanced-definition television]] (EDTV [[480p]]).  In North America, digital SDTV is broadcast in the same [[4:3]] aspect ratio as NTSC signals with widescreen content being [[center cut]].<ref>[http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/digitaltv.html All-Digital Television Is Coming (And Sooner Than You Think!)]</ref> However, in other parts of the world that used the PAL or SECAM color systems, standard-definition television is now usually shown with a [[16:9]] [[aspect ratio]], with the transition occurring between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s. Older programs with a 4:3 aspect ratio are shown in the US as 4:3 with non-ATSC countries preferring to reduce the horizontal resolution by anamorphically scaling a [[pillarbox]]ed image.\n\n====HD====\n{{main article|High-definition television}}\n\nHigh-definition television (HDTV) provides a [[Image resolution|resolution]] that is substantially higher than that of [[standard-definition television]].\n\nHDTV may be transmitted in various formats:\n* [[1080p]]: 1920\u00d71080p: 2,073,600 pixels (~2.07 [[megapixel]]s) per [[frame (video)|frame]]\n* [[1080i]]: 1920\u00d71080i: 1,036,800 pixels  (~1.04 MP) per [[field (video)|field]] or 2,073,600 pixels (~2.07 MP) per frame\n** A non-standard CEA resolution exists in some countries such as 1440\u00d71080i: 777,600 pixels (~0.78 MP) per field or 1,555,200 pixels (~1.56 MP) per frame<!-- Do not delete this, it is used for all free to air HDTV in the UK (and probably elsewhere) and is also used by various home recording equipment.

After production, the next step is to market and deliver the product to whichever markets are open to using it. This typically happens on two levels:\n\n# '''Original run''' or '''First run''': a producer creates a program of one or multiple episodes and shows it on a station or network which has either paid for the production itself or to which a license has been granted by the [[television producer]]s to do the same.\n# '''[[Broadcast syndication]]''': this is the terminology rather broadly used to describe secondary programming usages (beyond original run). It includes secondary runs in the country of first issue, but also international usage which may not be managed by the originating producer. In many cases, other companies, [[TV stations]], or individuals are engaged to do the syndication work, in other words, to sell the product into the markets they are allowed to sell into by contract from the copyright holders, in most cases the producers.\n\nFirst-run programming is increasing on subscription services outside the US, but few domestically produced programs are syndicated on domestic [[free-to-air]] (FTA) elsewhere. This practice is increasing, however, generally on digital-only FTA channels or with subscriber-only, first-run material appearing on FTA. Unlike the US, repeat FTA screenings of an FTA network program usually only occur on that network. Also, [[Network affiliate|affiliates]] rarely buy or produce non-network programming that is not centered on [[local programming]].\n\n===Genres===\n{{globalize/US|section|date=December 2014}}\n[[Television genre]]s include a broad range of programming types that entertain, inform, and educate viewers. The most expensive entertainment genres to produce are usually dramas and dramatic [[miniseries]]. However, other genres, such as historical Western genres, may also have high production costs.[[Popular culture]] entertainment genres include action-oriented shows such as police, crime, detective dramas, horror, or thriller shows. As well, there are also other variants of the drama genre, such as [[medical drama]]s and daytime [[soap opera]]s. [[Science fiction]] shows can fall into either the drama or action category, depending on whether they emphasize philosophical questions or high adventure. Comedy is a popular genre which includes [[situation comedy]] (sitcom) and animated shows for the adult demographic such as ''[[South Park]]''.\n\nThe least expensive forms of entertainment programming genres are [[game show]]s, [[talk show]]s, [[variety show]]s, and [[reality television]]. Game shows feature contestants answering questions and solving puzzles to win prizes. Talk shows contain interviews with film, television, music and sports celebrities and public figures. Variety shows feature a range of musical performers and other entertainers, such as comedians and magicians, introduced by a host or [[Master of Ceremonies]]. There is some crossover between some talk shows and variety shows because leading talk shows often feature performances by bands, singers, comedians, and other performers in between the interview segments. ''Reality TV'' shows \"regular\" people (i.e., not [[actors]]) facing unusual challenges or experiences ranging from arrest by police officers (''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'') to significant weight loss (''[[The Biggest Loser]]''). A variant version of reality shows depicts celebrities doing mundane activities such as going about their everyday life (''[[The Osbournes]]'', ''[[Snoop Dogg's Father Hood]]'') or doing regular jobs (''[[The Simple Life]]'').\n\nFictional television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are  \"[[quality television]]\", include series such as ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]''. Kristin Thompson argues that some of these television series exhibit traits also found in [[art film]]s, such as psychological realism, narrative complexity, and ambiguous plotlines. Nonfiction television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are  \"quality television\", include a range of serious, noncommercial, programming aimed at a niche audience, such as [[Documentary film|documentaries]] and public affairs shows.\n\n===Funding===\n[[File:TV users.svg|thumb|250px|right|Television sets per 1000 people of the world\n{| style=\"width: 250px;\"\n|-\n| {{legend|#10547C|1000+}} || {{legend|#70BEED|100\u2013200}}\n|-\n| {{legend|#1674AB|500\u20131000}} || {{legend|#9DD2F2|50\u2013100}}\n|-\n| {{legend|#1B8BCF|300\u2013500}} || {{legend|#CCE8F9|0\u201350}}\n|-\n| {{legend|#3CA6E6|200\u2013300}} || {{legend|Grey|No data}}\n|}\n]]\n\nAround the globe, broadcast TV is financed by government, advertising, licensing (a form of tax), subscription, or any combination of these. To protect revenues, subscription TV channels are usually encrypted to ensure that only subscribers receive the decryption codes to see the signal. Unencrypted channels are known as free to air or FTA. In 2009, the global TV market represented 1,217.2 million TV households with at least one TV and total revenues of 268.9 billion EUR (declining 1.2% compared to 2008).<ref>[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/world-tv-market-2010.html Global TV 2010 \u2013 Markets, Trends Facts & Figures (2008\u20132013)] International Television Expert Group</ref> North America had the biggest TV revenue market share with 39% followed by Europe (31%), Asia-Pacific (21%), Latin America (8%), and Africa and the Middle East (2%).<ref>[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/global-tv-revenues-2008-2009.html Global TV Revenues (2008\u201309)] International Television Expert Group</ref> Globally, the different TV revenue sources divide into 45%\u201350% TV advertising revenues, 40%\u201345% subscription fees and 10% public funding.<ref>[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/world-tv-market-2010.html iDate's Global TV Revenue Market Shares] International Television Expert Group</ref><ref>[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/international_television_market_report_2009.html OFCOM's Global TV Market Report 2009] International Television Expert Group</ref>\n\n====Advertising====\n{{main article|Television advertisement}}\n\nTV's broad reach makes it a powerful and attractive medium for advertisers. Many TV networks and stations sell blocks of broadcast time to advertisers (\"sponsors\") to fund their programming.<ref name=\"Hornick\">[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/5/2006_5_50.shtml Karen Hornick] \"That Was the Year That Was\" ''American Heritage'', Oct. 2006.</ref> Television advertisements (variously called a television commercial, commercial or ad in [[American English]], and known in [[British English]] as an advert) is a span of [[television program]]ming produced and paid for by an organization, which conveys a message, typically to market a product or service. Advertising revenue provides a significant portion of the funding for most privately owned [[television networks]]. The vast majority of television advertisements today consist of brief advertising spots, ranging in length from a few seconds to several minutes (as well as program-length [[infomercial]]s). Advertisements of this sort have been used to promote a wide variety of goods, services and ideas since the beginning of television.\n\n[[File:Radio News Sep 1928 Cover.jpg|thumb|right|Television was still in its experimental phase in 1928, but the medium's potential to sell goods was already predicted.]]\n\nThe effects of television advertising upon the viewing public (and the effects of mass media in general) have been the subject of philosophical discourse by such luminaries as [[Marshall McLuhan]]. The viewership of television programming, as measured by companies such as [[Nielsen Media Research]], is often used as a metric for television advertisement placement, and consequently, for the rates charged to advertisers to air within a given network, television program, or time of day (called a \"daypart\"). In many countries, including the [[United States]], television [[Campaign advertising|campaign advertisements]] are considered indispensable for a [[political campaign]]. In other countries, such as France, political advertising on television is heavily restricted,<ref>Fritz Plasser, ''Global Political Campaigning'', p226</ref> while some countries, such as [[Norway]], completely ban political advertisements.\n\nThe first official, paid television advertisement was broadcast in the United States on July 1, 1941 over New York station WNBT (now [[WNBC]]) before a baseball game between the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. The announcement for [[Bulova]] watches, for which the company paid anywhere from $4.00 to $9.00 (reports vary), displayed a WNBT test pattern modified to look like a clock with the hands showing the time. The Bulova logo, with the phrase \"Bulova Watch Time\", was shown in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern while the second hand swept around the dial for one minute.<ref>\"Imagery For Profit\" R.W. Stewart, New York Times, July 6, 1941.</ref><ref>[http://www.earlytelevision.org/images/rca_bulova_ad-1.jpg] WNBT/Bulova test pattern</ref> The first TV ad broadcast in the UK was on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] on 22 September 1955, advertising [[Gibbs SR]] toothpaste. The first TV ad broadcast in Asia was on [[Nippon Television]] in [[Tokyo]] on August 28, 1953, advertising [[Seikosha]] (now [[Seiko]]), which also displayed a clock with the current time.<ref>[[:ja:\u30b3\u30de\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8|\u30b3\u30de\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8 (Commercial message)]], Retrieved 2013-11-24{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2015}}</ref>\n\n=====United States=====\nSince inception in the US in 1941,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediahistory.umn.edu/timeline/1940-1949.html |title=1940\u20131949 C.E. : Media History Project : U of M |publisher=Mediahistory.umn.edu |date=2012-05-18 |accessdate=2012-11-02}}</ref> [[television commercial]]s have become one of the most effective, persuasive, and popular methods of selling products of many sorts, especially consumer goods. During the 1940s and into the 1950s, programs were hosted by single advertisers. This, in turn, gave great creative license to the [[advertiser]]s over the content of the show. Perhaps due to the [[quiz show scandals]] in the 1950s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/quizshow/peopleevents/pande07.html |title=The American Experience &#124; Quiz Show Scandal &#124; People & Events &#124; The Aftermath of the Quiz Show Scandal |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2012-11-02}}</ref> networks shifted to the magazine concept, introducing [[advertising]] breaks with multiple advertisers.\n\nUS advertising rates are determined primarily by [[Nielsen ratings]]. The time of the day and popularity of the channel determine how much a TV commercial can cost. For example, it can cost approximately $750,000 for a 30-second block of commercial time during the highly popular [[American Idol]], while the same amount of time for the [[Super Bowl]] can cost several million dollars. Conversely, lesser-viewed [[time slot]]s, such as early mornings and weekday afternoons, are often sold in bulk to producers of [[infomercials]] at far lower rates. In recent years, the paid program or [[infomercial]] has become common, usually in lengths of 30 minutes or one hour. Some [[Pharmaceutical company|drug companies]] and other businesses have even created \"news\" items for broadcast, known in the industry as [[video news release]]s, paying [[program director]]s to use them.<ref>[[Jon Stewart]] of \"[[The Daily Show]]\" was mock-outraged at this, saying, \"That's what we do!\", and calling it a new form of television, \"infoganda\".</ref>\n\nSome TV programs also deliberately place products into their shows as advertisements, a practice started in feature films<ref>{{Cite book |last=Segrave |first=Kerry |title=Product Placement in Hollywood Films |year=1994 |isbn= 0-7864-1904-0 |postscript=.}}</ref> and known as [[product placement]]. For example, a character could be drinking a certain kind of soda, going to a particular [[Restaurant chain|chain restaurant]], or driving a certain make of car. (This is sometimes very subtle, with shows having vehicles provided by manufacturers for low cost in exchange as a [[product placement]]). Sometimes, a specific brand or [[Trademark|trade mark]], or music from a certain artist or group, is used. (This excludes guest appearances by artists who perform on the show.)\n\n=====United Kingdom=====\nThe TV regulator oversees TV advertising in the United Kingdom. Its restrictions have applied since the early days of commercially funded TV. Despite this, an early TV mogul, [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet|Roy Thomson]], likened the broadcasting licence as being a \"licence to print money\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=34783&sectioncode=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616115610/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=34783&sectioncode=1 |archivedate=2011-06-16 |title=Kenneth Roy Thomson |publisher=Press Gazette |date=7 July 2006 |accessdate=24 April 2010}}</ref> Restrictions mean that the big three national commercial TV channels: [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]], [[Channel 4]], and [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] can show an average of only seven minutes of advertising per hour (eight minutes in the peak period). Other broadcasters must average no more than nine minutes (twelve in the peak). This means that many imported TV shows from the US have unnatural pauses where the UK company does not utilize the narrative breaks intended for more frequent US advertising. Advertisements must not be inserted in the course of certain specific proscribed types of programs which last less than half an hour in scheduled duration; this list includes any news or current affairs programs, documentaries, and programs for children; additionally, advertisements may not be carried in a program designed and broadcast for reception in schools or in any [[religious broadcasting]] service or other devotional program or during a formal Royal ceremony or occasion. There also must be clear demarcations in time between the programs and the advertisements. The [[BBC]], being strictly [[non-commercial]], is not allowed to show advertisements on television in the UK, although it has many advertising-funded channels abroad. The majority of its budget comes from [[television license]] fees (see below) and [[broadcast syndication]], the sale of content to other broadcasters.\n\n=====Ireland=====\nThe [[Broadcasting Commission of Ireland]] (BCI) ({{lang-ga|Coimisi\u00fan Craolach\u00e1in na h\u00c9ireann}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bci.ie/ |title=BCI :: Introduction to the BCI |publisher=Bci.ie |date=1 October 2009 |accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref> oversees advertising on television and radio within Ireland for both private and state-owned broadcasters. There are some restrictions based on advertising, especially in relation to the advertising of alcohol. Such advertisements are prohibited until after 7&nbsp;pm. Broadcasters in Ireland adhere to broadcasting legislation implemented by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the [[European Union]]. [[Sponsor (commercial)|Sponsorship]] of current affairs programming is prohibited at all times. As of 1 October 2009, the responsibilities held by the BCI are gradually being transferred to the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]].\n\n====Subscription====\nSome TV channels are partly funded from [[subscription]]s; therefore, the signals are encrypted during broadcast to ensure that only the paying subscribers have access to the decryption codes to watch [[pay television]] or [[specialty channel]]s. Most subscription services are also funded by [[advertising]].\n\n====Taxation or license====\nTelevision services in some countries may be funded by a [[television licence]] or a form of taxation, which means that advertising plays a lesser role or no role at all. For example, some channels may carry no advertising at all and some very little, including:\n* Australia ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]])\n* Belgium ([[RTBF]])\n* Denmark ([[Danmarks Radio|DR]])\n* Ireland ([[RT\u00c9]])\n* Japan ([[NHK]])\n* Norway ([[NRK]])\n* Sweden ([[Sveriges Television|SVT]])\n* United Kingdom ([[BBC]])\n* United States ([[PBS]])\n\nThe [[BBC]] carries no [[television advertising]] on its UK channels and is funded by an annual television licence paid by premises receiving live TV broadcasts. Currently, it is estimated that approximately 26.8 million UK private domestic households own televisions, with approximately 25 million TV licences in all premises in force as of 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/about/foi-licences-facts-and-figures-AB18/|title=TV Licensing-FOI: Licences facts and figures |publisher=tvlicensing.co.uk |accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref> This television license fee is set by the government, but the BBC is not answerable to or controlled by the government.\n\nThe two main BBC TV channels are watched by almost 90% of the population each week and overall have 27% share of total viewing,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?report=multichannel&requesttimeout=500&flag=viewingsummary |title=viewing statistics in UK |publisher=Barb.co.uk |accessdate=17 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005045049/http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?report=multichannel&requesttimeout=500&flag=viewingsummary |archivedate=5 October 2008 }}</ref> despite the fact that 85% of homes are multichannel, with 42% of these having access to 200 free to air channels via satellite and another 43% having access to 30 or more channels via [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/research/tv/reports/dtv/dtv_2007_q3/dtvq307.pdf |title=The Communications Market: Digital Progress Report \u2013 Digital TV, Q3 2007 |format=PDF |accessdate=18 June 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625013029/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/research/tv/reports/dtv/dtv_2007_q3/dtvq307.pdf |archivedate = 25 June 2008}}</ref> The licence that funds the seven advertising-free BBC TV channels currently costs \u00a3139.50 a year (about US$215) regardless of the number of TV sets owned. When the same sporting event has been presented on both BBC and commercial channels, the BBC always attracts the lion's share of the [[audience]], indicating that viewers prefer to watch TV uninterrupted by advertising.\n\nOther than internal promotional material, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) carries no advertising; it is banned under the [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/ActCompilation1.nsf/all/search/8B104AA963F8AB9FCA25718D002260DC ABC Act 1983]. The ABC receives its funding from the Australian government every three years.

The ABC also receives funds from its many ABC shops across Australia. Although funded by the Australian government, the editorial independence of the ABC is ensured through law.\n\nIn France, government-funded channels carry advertisements, yet those who own television sets have to pay an annual tax (\"la redevance audiovisuelle\").<ref>[http://www.minefi.gouv.fr/paca/minefi_relais_sociaux/impots/fiche21.html Ministry of Finance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501212316/http://www.minefi.gouv.fr/paca/minefi_relais_sociaux/impots/fiche21.html |date=1 May 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn Japan, [[NHK]] is paid for by license fees (known in Japanese as {{nihongo| reception fee |\u53d7\u4fe1\u6599|Jushinry\u014d}}). The broadcast law that governs NHK's funding stipulates that any television equipped to receive NHK is required to pay. The fee is standardized, with discounts for office workers and students who commute, as well a general discount for residents of Okinawa prefecture.\n\n==Social aspects==\n{{Main article|Social aspects of television}}\n[[File:Family watching television 1958.jpg|thumb|200px| American family watching TV, circa 1958]]\nTelevision has played a pivotal role in the socialization of the 20th and 21st centuries. There are many aspects of television that can be addressed, including negative issues such as [[media violence]]. Current research is discovering that individuals suffering from social isolation can employ television to create what is termed a parasocial or faux relationship with characters from their favorite television shows and movies as a way of deflecting feelings of loneliness and social deprivation.<ref name=\"scientificamerican.com\">Butler, Fionnuala, Cynthia Pickett.  \"Imaginary Friends.\"  Scientific American.
