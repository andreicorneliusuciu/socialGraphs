Accessed 25 September 2013</ref>  It usually includes a built-in [[encoder]].<ref>[http://www.anaheimautomation.com/manuals/forms/servo-motor-guide.php Anaheim Automation: Servo Motor Guide]. Accessed 25 September 2013</ref> A servomechanism is sometimes called a '''heterostat''' since it controls a system's behavior by means of [[Heterostasis (cybernetics)|heterostasis]].\n\nThe term correctly applies only to systems where the [[feedback]] or error-correction signals help control mechanical position, speed or other parameters.<ref>[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/servomechanism.html BusinessDictionary.com definition]. Accessed 25 September 2013</ref> For example, an automotive [[power window]] control is not a servomechanism, as there is no automatic feedback that controls position\u2014the operator does this by observation. By contrast a car's [[cruise control]] uses [[Control theory|closed loop feedback]], which classifies it as a servomechanism.\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Position control===\nA common type of servo provides ''position control''. Servos are commonly electrical or partially electronic in nature, using an [[electric motor]] as the primary means of creating mechanical [[force]]. Other types of servos use [[hydraulics]], [[pneumatics]], or [[magnetic]] principles. Servos operate on the principle of negative feedback, where the control input is compared to the actual position of the mechanical system as measured by some sort of [[transducer]] at the output. Any difference between the actual and wanted values (an \"error signal\") is amplified (and converted) and used to drive the system in the direction necessary to reduce or eliminate the error.  This procedure is one widely used application of [[control theory]].\n\n===Speed control===\nSpeed control via a [[Governor (device)|governor]] is another type of servomechanism. The [[steam engine]] uses mechanical governors; another early application was to govern the speed of [[water wheels]]. Prior to World War II the [[constant speed propeller]] was developed to control engine speed for maneuvering aircraft. Fuel controls for [[gas turbine]] engines employ either hydromechanical or electronic governing.\n\n===Other===\nPositioning servomechanisms were first used in military [[fire-control]] and [[marine navigation]] equipment. Today servomechanisms are used in [[CNC|automatic machine tools]], satellite-tracking antennas, remote control airplanes, automatic navigation systems on boats and planes, and [[antiaircraft]]-gun control systems. Other examples are [[fly-by-wire]] systems in [[aircraft]] which use servos to actuate the aircraft's control surfaces, and [[radio-controlled model]]s which use RC servos for the same purpose. Many [[autofocus]] cameras also use a servomechanism to accurately move the lens, and thus adjust the focus. A modern [[hard disk drive]] has a magnetic servo system with sub-micrometre positioning accuracy. In industrial machines, servos are used to perform complex motion, in many applications.\n\n==Rotary or linear==\nTypical servos give a rotary (angular) output. Linear types are common as well, using a [[leadscrew]] or a [[linear motor]] to give linear motion.\n\n==Servomotor==\n[[image:servo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Small R/C servo mechanism1. <br>1. [[electric motor]]<br>\n2. position feedback [[potentiometer]]<br>\n3. reduction [[gear]]<br>\n4. [[actuator arm]] ]]\n{{main|Servomotor|servo (radio control)}}\nA ''[[servomotor]]'' is a specific type of motor that is combined with a [[rotary encoder]] or a [[potentiometer]] to form a servomechanism. This assembly may in turn form part of another servomechanism. A potentiometer provides a simple analog signal to indicate position, while an encoder provides position and usually speed feedback, which by the use of a [[PID controller]] allow more precise control of position and thus faster achievement of a stable position (for a given motor power). Potentiometers are subject to [[Temperature coefficient#Electrical resistance|drift]] when the temperature changes whereas encoders are more stable and accurate.\n\nServomotors are used for both high-end and low-end applications. On the high end are precision industrial components that use a rotary encoder. On the low end are inexpensive [[servo (radio control)|radio control servos]] (RC servos) used in [[radio-controlled model]]s which use a free-running motor and a simple potentiometer position sensor with an embedded controller. The term ''servomotor'' generally refers to a high-end industrial component while the term ''servo'' is most often used to describe the inexpensive devices that employ a potentiometer. [[Stepper motor]]s are not considered to be servomotors, although they too are used to construct larger servomechanisms. Stepper motors have inherent angular positioning, owing to their construction, and this is generally used in an open-loop manner without feedback. They are generally used for medium-precision applications.\n\nRC servos are used to provide actuation for various mechanical systems such as the steering of a car, the control surfaces on a plane, or the rudder of a boat. Due to their affordability, reliability, and simplicity of control by microprocessors, they are often used in small-scale [[robotics]] applications. A standard RC receiver (or a microcontroller) sends [[pulse-width modulation]] (PWM) signals to the servo. The electronics inside the servo translate the width of the pulse into a position. When the servo is commanded to rotate, the motor is powered until the potentiometer reaches the value corresponding to the commanded position.\n\n==History==\n[[James Watt]]'s [[steam engine]] [[Governor (device)|governor]] is generally considered the first powered feedback system. The [[windmill fantail]] is an earlier example of automatic control, but since it does not have an [[amplifier]] or [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], it is not usually considered a servomechanism.\n\nThe first feedback position control device was the ship [[steering engine]], used to position the rudder of large ships based on the position of the ship's wheel. \n[[John McFarlane Gray]] was a pioneer. His patented design was used on the [[SS Great Eastern]] in 1866.\n[[Joseph Farcot]] may deserve equal credit for the feedback concept, with several patents between 1862 and 1868.<ref name=\"Bennett1986\">{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=Stuart|title=A History of Control Engineering, 1800\u20131930|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1gfKkqB_fTcC&pg=PA98|date=1986-01-01|publisher=IET|isbn=978-0-86341-047-5|pages=98\u2013100}}</ref>\n\nThe telemotor was invented around 1872 by [[Andrew Betts Brown]], allowing elaborate mechanisms between the control room and the engine to be greatly simplified.<ref>http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Andrew_Betts_Brown</ref> Steam steering engines had the characteristics of a modern servomechanism: an input, an output, an error signal, and a means for amplifying the error signal used for negative feedback to drive the error towards zero. The Ragonnet [[power reverse]] mechanism was a general purpose air or steam-powered servo amplifier for linear motion patented in 1909.<ref>Eugine L. Ragonnet, Controlling Mechanism for Locomotives, [http://www.google.com/patents?id=chtDAAAAEBAJ U.S. Patent 930,225], Aug. 9, 1909.</ref>\n\nElectrical servomechanisms were used as early as 1888 in [[Elisha Gray]]'s [[Telautograph]].\n\nElectrical servomechanisms require a power amplifier. [[World War II]] saw the development of electrical [[fire-control]] servomechanisms, using an [[amplidyne]] as the power amplifier. [[Vacuum tube]] amplifiers were used in the [[UNISERVO]] tape drive for the [[UNIVAC I]] computer. The Royal Navy began experimenting with Remote Power Control ([[List of British ordnance terms#RPC|RPC]]) on [[HMS Champion (1915)|HMS Champion]] in 1928 and began using RPC to control searchlights in the early 1930s. During WW2 RPC was used to control gun mounts and gun directors.\n\nModern servomechanisms use solid state power amplifiers, usually built from [[MOSFET]] or [[thyristor]] devices. Small servos may use power [[transistor]]s.\n\nThe origin of the word is believed to come from the French \"''Le Servomoteur''\" or the slavemotor, first used by J. J. L. Farcot in 1868 to describe hydraulic and steam engines for use in ship steering.<ref name=\"origin\">IEEE Industry Applications Magazine March/April 1996, pg 74</ref>\n\nThe simplest kind of servos use [[bang\u2013bang control]]. More complex control systems use proportional control, [[PID control]], and state space control, which are studied in [[Control theory#Modern control theory|modern control theory]].\n\n==Types of performances==\n\nServos can be classified by means of their feedback control systems:<ref>G.

Younkin, Industrial Servo Control Systems \u2013 Fundamentals and Applications \u2013 Second Edition, Taylor and Francis, 2007.</ref>\n\n* type 0 servos: under steady-state conditions they produce a constant value of the output with a constant error signal;\n* type 1 servos: under steady-state conditions they produce a constant value of the output with null error signal, but a constant rate of change of the reference implies a constant error in tracking the reference;\n* type 2 servos: under steady-state conditions they produce a constant value of the output with null error signal. A constant rate of change of the reference implies a null error in tracking the reference. A constant rate of acceleration of the reference implies a constant error in tracking the reference.\n\nThe [[servo bandwidth]] indicates the capability of the servo to follow rapid changes in the commanded input.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Fractional horsepower motor]]\n*[[Motion control]]\n*[[Servo control]]\n*[[Synchro]], a form of transmitter and receiver motor used in servomechanisms\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book\n|title=A History of Control Engineering 1930\u20131955\n |last=Bennett\n |first= S. \n|authorlink= \n|coauthors= \n|year=1993 |publisher =Peter Peregrinus Ltd.
