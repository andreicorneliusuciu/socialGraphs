The DOD is the complement of SOC: as one increases, the other decreases. While the SOC units are percent points (0% = empty; 100% = full), DOD can use [[Ampere-hour | Ah]] units (e.g.: 0 = full, 50 Ah = empty) or percent points (100% = empty; 0% = full). As a battery may actually have higher capacity than its nominal rating, it is possible for the DOD value to exceed the full value (e.g.: 55 Ah or 110%), something that is not possible when using state of charge.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Battery balancer]]\n* [[Battery monitoring]]\n* [[Battery charger]]\n* [[Deep cycle battery]]\n* [[State of health]]\n* [[Battery management system]]\n\n== References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Battery charging]]"}]}}}}
