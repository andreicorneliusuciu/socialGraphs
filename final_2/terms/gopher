Gophers are [[Endemism|endemic]] to North and Central America.\n\nThe name \"pocket gopher\" on its own may be used to refer to any of a number of [[genus|genera]] within the [[family (biology)|family]]. These are the \"true\" gophers; however several [[ground squirrel]]s in the distantly related family [[Sciuridae]] are often called gophers, as well.\n\n== Description ==\nGophers weigh around {{convert|0.5|lb|g|abbr=on}}, and are about {{convert|6-8|in|abbr=on}} long in body length, with a tail {{convert|1-2|in|abbr=on}} long. A few species reach weights approaching {{convert|1|kg|abbr=on}}.  Within any species, the males are larger than the females and can be nearly double their weight.<ref>{{cite book\n  | editor-last = Macdonald\n  | editor-first = David W.\n  | title = The Encyclopedia of Mammals\n  | publisher = Oxford University Press\n  | year=  2006\n  | isbn = 0-19-920608-2 }}</ref>\n\nTheir lifespans are normally one to three years<ref name=\"Hygnstrom\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gt-Yk3CRuXMC&pg=SL2-PA21 | title=Prevention and Control of Wildlife Damage | publisher=DIANE Publishing Inc. | author=Hygnstrom, Scott E. | year=2010 | page=B\u201321 | isbn=1-4379-3688-1}}</ref> assuming no diseases or predation.

Their most characteristic features are their large [[cheek]] pouches, from which the word \"pocket\" in their name derives.  These pouches are fur-lined, can be turned inside out, and extend from the side of the mouth well back onto the shoulders. Gophers have small eyes and a short, hairy tail, which they use to feel around tunnels when they walk backwards.\n\nPocket gophers have been found to often carry external [[Parasitism|parasites]].<ref name=\"Hygnstrom\" /> Common predators of the gopher include weasels, snakes, and hawks.<ref name=\"nwf pocket gophers\">{{cite web | url=http://www.nwf.org/wildlife/wildlife-library/mammals/pocket-gophers.aspx | title=Pocket Gophers | publisher=National Wildlife Federation | accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Behavior ===\nAll pocket gophers create a network of [[Burrow|tunnel]] systems that provide protection and a means of collecting food. They are [[hoarding (animal behaviour)|larder hoarders]], and their cheek pouches are used for transporting food back to their burrows.  Gophers can collect large hoards. Unlike [[ground squirrel]]s, gophers do not live in large communities and seldom find themselves above ground.\n\nThe entrances can be identified by small piles of loose soil covering the opening.<ref name=\"a-z-animals\">{{cite web | url=http://a-z-animals.com/animals/gopher | title=Gopher | publisher=A-Z Animals | accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref> Their burrows can be found in many areas where the soil is softer and easily tunneled. They often appear in vegetable gardens, lawns, or farms, as gophers like moist soil (see [[Soil biomantle]]). This has led to their frequent treatment as [[pest (animal)|pests]].\n\nGophers eat plant roots, shrubs, and other vegetables such as carrots, lettuce, radishes, and any other vegetables with juice. Some species are considered agricultural pests. The resulting destruction of plant life then leaves the area a stretch of denuded soil.  At the same time, the soil disturbance created by  turning it over can lead to the establishment of early successional communities of r-selected and other ruderal plant species.  The stashing and subsequent decomposition of plant material in the gophers' larder can produce deep fertilization of the soil.{{cn|date=July 2016}}\n\nPocket gophers are [[wikt:solitary|solitary]] outside of the breeding season, aggressively maintaining territories that vary in size depending on the resources available. Males and females may share some burrows and nesting chambers if their territories border each other, but in general, each pocket gopher inhabits its own individual tunnel system. Although they attempt to flee when threatened, they may attack other animals, including cats and humans, and can inflict serious bites with their long, sharp teeth.\n\nDepending on the species and local conditions, pocket gophers may have a specific annual breeding season, or may breed repeatedly through the year. Each litter typically consists of two to five young, although this may be much higher in some species. The young are born blind and helpless, and are [[weaning|weaned]] at around 40 days.<ref name=EoM>{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|author= Patton, James|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 628\u2013631|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}}</ref>\n\n==Control==\n''Geomys'' and ''Thomomys'' species are classed as \"prohibited new organisms\" under New Zealand's [[Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996]] preventing them from being imported into the country.<ref>{{citation| url=http://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1996/0030/latest/DLM386556.html#DLM386556|title=Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 2003 - Schedule 2 Prohibited new organisms|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Pocket gopher.jpg|thumb|220px|A typical pocket gopher.]]\n\nMuch debate exists among [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] about which races of pocket gopher should be recognised as full species, and the following list cannot be regarded as definitive.\n* Family '''Geomyidae'''\n** Genus ''[[Cratogeomys]]''; some authors treat this genus as a subgenus of ''[[Pappogeomys]]''.\n*** [[Yellow-faced pocket gopher]] (''Cratogeomys castanops'')\n*** [[Oriental Basin pocket gopher]] (''[[Cratogeomys fulvescens|C. fulvescens]]'')\n*** [[Smoky pocket gopher]] (''C. fumosus'')\n*** [[Llano pocket gopher]] (''C. gymnurus'')\n*** [[Merriam's pocket gopher]] (''C. merriami'')\n** Genus ''[[Geomys]]'' - eastern pocket gophers; principally found in the southwestern United States, east of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains\n*** ''[[Geomys arenarius]]''; two subspecies, the desert and White Sands pocket gophers\n*** [[Attwater's pocket gopher]] (''G. attwateri'')\n*** [[Plains pocket gopher]] (''G. bursarius''); two subspecies\n*** [[Knox Jones's pocket gopher]] (''G. knoxjonesi'')\n*** ''[[Geomys personatus]]''; five subspecies including the Texas, Davis, maritime, and Carrizo Springs pocket gophers\n*** ''[[Geomys pinetis]]''; four subspecies, the southeastern, Cumberland Island, Sherman's, and [[Goff's pocket gopher|Goff's]] pocket gophers\n*** ''[[Geomys texensis]]''; two subspecies, including the llano pocket gopher\n** Genus ''[[Orthogeomys]]'' - giant pocket gophers or taltuzas; found in Mexico, Central America, and Colombia\n*** [[Chiriqui pocket gopher]] (''Orthogeomys cavator'')\n*** [[Cherrie's pocket gopher]] (''O. cherriei'')\n*** [[Oaxacan pocket gopher]] (''O. cuniculus'')\n*** [[Darien pocket gopher]] (''O. dariensis'')\n*** [[Giant pocket gopher]] (''O. grandis'')\n*** [[Variable pocket gopher]] (''O. heterodus'')\n*** [[Hispid pocket gopher]] (''O. hispidus'')\n*** [[Big pocket gopher]] (''O. lanius'')\n*** [[Nicaraguan pocket gopher]] (''O. matagalpae'')\n*** [[Thaeler's pocket gopher]] (''O. thaeleri'')\n*** [[Underwood's pocket gopher]] (''O. underwoodi'')\n** Genus ''[[Pappogeomys]]''; found in Mexico.\n*** [[Alcorn's pocket gopher]] (''Pappogeomys alcorni'')\n*** [[Buller's pocket gopher]] (''P. bulleri'')\n** Genus ''[[Thomomys]]'' - western pocket gophers; widely distributed in North America, extending into the northwestern US, Canada, and the southeastern US.\n*** ''[[Thomomys bottae]]''; many subspecies, including Botta's, Fish Spring, Bonneville, Clear Lake, San Antonio, Pistol River, Mount Ellen, Guadalupe, Limpia, Mearns', Stansbury Island, Antelope Island, Cebolleta, Salinas, Skull Valley, Swasey Springs, Harquahala, and Limpia Greek pocket gophers\n*** [[Camas pocket gopher]] (''T. bulbivorus'')\n*** [[Wyoming pocket gopher]] (''T. clusius'')\n*** [[Idaho pocket gopher]] (''T. idahoensis'')\n*** [[Mazama pocket gopher]] (''T. mazama''); several subspecies including the western, Gold Beach, Olympic, and [[Tacoma pocket gopher|Tacoma]] pocket gophers\n*** [[Mountain pocket gopher]] (''T. monticola'')\n*** [[Northern pocket gopher]] (''T. talpoides''); very widely distributed; several subspecies including the Cheyenne northern pocket gopher\n*** [[Townsend's pocket gopher]] (''T. townsendii'')\n*** [[Southern pocket gopher]] (''T. umbrinus'')\n** Genus ''[[Zygogeomys]]''\n*** [[Michoacan pocket gopher]] or tuza (''Zygogeomys trichopus'')\n\nSome sources also list a genus ''[[Hypogeomys]]'', with one species, but this genus name is normally used for the [[Malagasy giant rat]], which belongs to the family [[Nesomyidae]].\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[Minnesota]] is nicknamed the \"Gopher State\", and the [[University of Minnesota]]'s athletics teams are collectively known as the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers|Golden Gophers]], led by mascot [[Goldy Gopher]].
