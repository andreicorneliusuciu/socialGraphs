It then shifted its hardware product line to emphasize servers and storage. High-level telecom control systems such as [[Operational Support Systems]] service predominantly used Sun equipment.\n\n===Motorola-based systems===\nSun originally used [[Motorola 68000 family]] central processing units for the [[Sun-1]] through [[Sun-3]] computer series. The Sun-1 employed a 68000 CPU, the [[Sun-2]] series, a [[Motorola 68010|68010]]. The Sun-3 series was based on the [[Motorola 68020|68020]], with the later Sun-3x using the [[Motorola 68030|68030]].<ref name=Sun-3x>{{Cite book\n|author1=George Becker |author2=Kathy Slatterly | year= 1991\n| title= A System Administrator's Guide to Sun Workstations\n| edition= First\n| publisher= Springer Verlag\n| location= New York\n| pages= 10\n| isbn= 0-387-97250-1 }}</ref>\n\n===SPARC-based systems===\n{{See also|SPARC}}\n[[Image:SPARCstation 1.jpg|right|thumb|SPARCstation 1+]]\nIn 1987, the company began using ''SPARC'', a RISC processor architecture of its own design, in its computer systems, starting with the [[Sun-4]] line. SPARC was initially a [[32-bit]] architecture (SPARC V7) until the introduction of the SPARC V9 architecture in 1995, which added [[64-bit]] extensions.\n\nSun has developed several generations of SPARC-based computer systems, including the [[SPARCstation]], [[Sun Ultra series|Ultra]] and [[Sun Blade (workstation)|Sun Blade]] series of workstations, and the SPARCserver, [[Sun Netra|Netra]], [[Sun Enterprise|Enterprise]] and [[Sun Fire]] line of servers.\n\nIn the early 1990s the company began to extend its product line to include large-scale [[symmetric multiprocessing]] servers, starting with the four-processor SPARCserver 600MP. This was followed by the 8-processor SPARCserver 1000 and 20-processor SPARCcenter 2000, which were based on work done in conjunction with [[Xerox PARC]]. In 1995 the company introduced [[Sun Ultra series]] machines that were equipped with the first 64-bit implementation of SPARC processors ([[UltraSPARC]]). In the late 1990s the transformation of product line in favor of large 64-bit SMP systems was accelerated by the acquisition of Cray Business Systems Division from Silicon Graphics.<ref name=\"Cray_BSD\"/> Their 32-bit, 64-processor [[Cray CS6400|Cray Superserver 6400]], related to the SPARCcenter, led to the 64-bit [[Sun Enterprise 10000]] high-end server (otherwise known as ''Starfire'').\n\nIn September 2004 Sun made available systems with [[UltraSPARC IV]]<ref>{{cite news |title= Sun plans to use UltraSparc IV chip to provide a superior server |publisher=TechSpot |date= September 13, 2004 | url= http://www.techspot.com/news/15374-sun-plans-to-use-ultrasparc-iv-chip-to-provide-a-superior-server.html |accessdate=July 12, 2012 }}</ref> which was the first multi-core SPARC processor.

Its intent was to drive more efficient use of CPU resources, which is of particular importance in [[data center]]s, where there is an increasing need to reduce power and air conditioning demands, much of which comes from the heat generated by CPUs. The T1 was followed in 2007 by the [[UltraSPARC T2]], which extended the number of threads per core from 4 to 8. Sun has open sourced the design specifications of both the T1 and T2 processors via the [[OpenSPARC]] project.\n\nIn 2006, Sun ventured into the ''[[blade server]]'' (high density rack-mounted systems) market with the [[Sun Blade]] (distinct from the Sun Blade workstation).\n\nIn April 2007 Sun released the SPARC Enterprise server products, jointly designed by Sun and Fujitsu and based on Fujitsu [[SPARC64 VI]] and later processors. The ''M-class'' SPARC Enterprise systems include high-end reliability and availability features. Later T-series servers have also been badged SPARC Enterprise rather than Sun Fire.\n\nIn April 2008 Sun released servers with UltraSPARC T2 Plus, which is an SMP capable version of UltraSPARC T2, available in 2 or 4 processor configurations. It was the first CoolThreads CPU with multi-processor capability and it made possible to build standard rack-mounted servers that could simultaneously process up to massive 256 CPU threads in hardware (Sun SPARC Enterprise T5440),<ref>{{cite news |title= Sun takes four-socket Victoria Falls Sparc plunge |publisher=The Register |date= October 13, 2008 | url= http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/13/sun_four_socket_sparc_t2/ |accessdate=July 12, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |title= Sun T5440 Oracle BI EE World Record Performance |publisher=Oracle BestPerf blog |date= July 21, 2009 | url= https://blogs.oracle.com/BestPerf/entry/sun_t5440_oracle_bi_ee |accessdate=July 12, 2012 }}</ref> which is considered a record in the industry.\n\nSince 2010, all further development of Sun machines based on SPARC architecture (including new [[SPARC T-Series]] servers, [[SPARC T3]] and [[SPARC T4|T4]] chips) is done as a part of Oracle Corporation hardware division.\n\n===x86-based systems===\nIn the late 1980s, Sun also marketed an [[Intel 80386]]-based machine, the [[Sun386i]]; this was designed to be a hybrid system, running SunOS but at the same time supporting DOS applications. This only remained on the market for a brief time. A follow-up \"486i\" upgrade was announced but only a few prototype units were ever manufactured.\n\nSun's brief first foray into x86 systems ended in the early 1990s, as it decided to concentrate on SPARC and retire the last Motorola systems and 386i products, a move dubbed by McNealy as \"all the wood behind one arrowhead\". Even so, Sun kept its hand in the x86 world, as a release of Solaris for [[PC compatible]]s began shipping in 1993.\n\nIn 1997 Sun acquired [[Diba, Inc.]], followed later by the acquisition of Cobalt Networks in 2000, with the aim of building ''network appliances'' (single function computers meant for consumers). Sun also marketed a ''[[network computer]]'' (a term popularized and eventually trademarked by Oracle); the [[JavaStation]] was a diskless system designed to run Java applications.\n\nAlthough none of these business initiatives were particularly successful, the Cobalt purchase gave Sun a toehold for its return to the x86 hardware market. In 2002, Sun introduced its first general purpose x86 system, the LX50, based in part on previous Cobalt system expertise. This was also Sun's first system announced to support [[Linux]] as well as Solaris.\n\nIn 2003, Sun announced a strategic alliance with AMD to produce x86/x64 servers based on AMD's Opteron processor; this was followed shortly by Sun's acquisition of Kealia, a startup founded by original Sun founder Andy Bechtolsheim, which had been focusing on high-performance AMD-based servers.\n\nThe following year, Sun launched the Opteron-based Sun Fire V20z and V40z servers, and the [[Java Workstation]] W1100z and W2100z workstations.\n\nOn September 12, 2005, Sun unveiled a new range of Opteron-based servers: the Sun Fire X2100, X4100 and X4200 servers.<ref>[http://www.sun.com/nc/05q3/videos/index.jsp?exec=3 Sun Microsystems<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051203062546/http://www.sun.com/nc/05q3/videos/index.jsp?exec=3 |date=December 3, 2005 }}</ref>  These were designed from scratch by a team led by Bechtolsheim to address heat and power consumption issues commonly faced in data centers.

Sun later developed software such as the [[Java programming language]] and acquired software such as [[StarOffice]], [[VirtualBox]] and [[MySQL]].\n\nSun used community-based and open-source licensing of its major technologies, and for its support of its products with other open source technologies. [[GNOME]]-based desktop software called [[Java Desktop System]] (originally code-named \"Madhatter\") was distributed for the Solaris operating system, and at one point for Linux. Sun supported its [[Java Enterprise System]] (a [[Middleware (distributed applications)|middleware]] stack) on Linux. It released the source code for Solaris under the [[open-source]] [[Common Development and Distribution License]], via the OpenSolaris community. Sun's positioning includes a commitment to indemnify users of some software from intellectual property disputes concerning that software. It offers support services on a variety of pricing bases, including per-employee and per-socket.\n\nA 2006 report prepared for the EU by [[UNU-MERIT]] stated that Sun was the largest corporate contributor to open source movements in the world.<ref name=\"MERIT-floss\">{{cite web | title = Study on the: Economic impact of open source software on innovation and the competitiveness of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector in the EU | url = http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/ict/policy/doc/2006-11-20-flossimpact.pdf | accessdate =January 25, 2007 | author=Rishab Aiyer Ghosh | date = November 20, 2006 | format = PDF | publisher=[[European Union]] | pages = 51 }}</ref> According to this report, Sun's open source contributions exceed the combined total of the next five largest commercial contributors.\n\n===Operating systems===\n{{Main article|Solaris (operating system)}}\n\nSun is best known for its Unix systems, which have a reputation for system stability and a consistent design philosophy.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nSun's first workstation shipped with [[UniSoft]] [[Version 7 Unix|V7 Unix]].

By the mid-1990s, the ensuing [[Unix wars]] had largely subsided, AT&T had sold off their Unix interests, and the relationship between the two companies was significantly reduced.\n\nFrom 1992 Sun also sold [[Interactive Unix]], an operating system it acquired when it bought Interactive Systems Corporation from Eastman Kodak Company. This was a popular Unix variant for the PC platform and a major competitor to market leader [[SCO UNIX]]. Sun's focus on Interactive Unix diminished in favor of Solaris on both SPARC and x86 systems; it was dropped as a product in 2001.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nSun dropped the Solaris 2.x version numbering scheme after the Solaris 2.6 release (1997); the following version was branded Solaris 7. This was the first 64-bit release, intended for the new [[UltraSPARC]] CPUs based on the SPARC V9 architecture. Within the next four years, the successors Solaris 8 and Solaris 9 were released in 2000 and 2002 respectively.\n\nFollowing several years of difficult competition and loss of server market share to competitors' Linux-based systems, Sun began to include Linux as part of its strategy in 2002. Sun supported both [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] and [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server]] on its x64 systems; companies such as [[Canonical Ltd.]], [[Wind River Systems]] and [[MontaVista]] also supported their versions of Linux on Sun's SPARC-based systems.\n\nIn 2004, after having cultivated a reputation as one of [[Microsoft]]'s most vocal antagonists, Sun entered into a joint relationship with them, resolving various legal entanglements between the two companies and receiving US$1.95&nbsp;billion in settlement payments from them.<ref>{{cite press release\n  |url = http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2004-04/sunflash.20040402.3.xml\n  |title = Microsoft and Sun Microsystems Enter Broad Cooperation Agreement; Settle Outstanding Litigation\n  |accessdate =June 16, 2008\n  |date = April 2, 2004\n  |publisher=Microsoft Corporation, Sun Microsystems, Inc.\n  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060322045711/http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2004-04/sunflash.20040402.3.xml\n  |archivedate = March 22, 2006\n}}</ref> Sun supported Microsoft Windows on its x64 systems, and announced other collaborative agreements with Microsoft, including plans to support each other's virtualization environments.<ref>{{cite news\n  | author=Mary Jo Foley\n  | title = Microsoft and Sun agree to support each other in virtualized environments\n  | url = http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=712\n  | work=[[ZDNet]]\n  | date = September 12, 2007\n  | accessdate =February 6, 2008\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the company released Solaris 10.

The following updates were released by Oracle under the new license agreement; the final release is Solaris 10 1/13.<ref>{{cite news\n  | author= Oracle Corporation\n  | title = Oracle Solaris 10 1/13\n  | url = http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solaris10/overview/solaris-latest-version-170418.html\n  | work= Oracle Web site\n  | date = Feb 8, 2013\n  | accessdate = March 13, 2013\n}}</ref>\n\nPreviously, Sun offered a separate variant of Solaris called [[Trusted Solaris]], which included augmented security features such as [[multilevel security]] and a [[least privilege]] access model. Solaris 10 included many of the same capabilities as Trusted Solaris at the time of its initial release; Solaris 10 11/06 included Solaris Trusted Extensions, which give it the remaining capabilities needed to make it the functional successor to Trusted Solaris.\n\nAfter releasing Solaris 10, its source code was opened under [[Common Development and Distribution License|CDDL]] [[free software]] license and developed in open with contributing [[OpenSolaris#History|Opensolaris community]] through [[Solaris (operating system)#Development release|SXCE]] that used [[UNIX System V#SVR4|SVR4]] [[.pkg]] packaging and supported [[OpenSolaris|Opensolaris]] releases that used [[Image Packaging System|IPS]].\nFollowing acquisition of Sun by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] , Opensolaris continued to develop in open under [[illumos]] with [[Illumos#Current distributions|illumos distributions]].\n\nOracle Corporation continued to develop OpenSolaris into next Solaris release, changing back the license to [[Proprietary software|proprietary]], and released it as Oracle [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris 11]] in November 2011.\n\n===Java platform===\n{{Main article|Java platform}}\nThe Java platform was developed at Sun in the early 1990s with the objective of allowing programs to function regardless of the device they were used on, sparking the slogan \"[[Write once, run anywhere]]\" (WORA). While this objective was not entirely achieved (prompting the riposte \"Write once, debug everywhere\"), Java is regarded as being largely hardware- and operating system-independent.\n\nJava was initially promoted as a platform for client-side [[Java applet|''applets'']] running inside web browsers. Early examples of Java applications were the [[HotJava]] [[web browser]] and the [[HotJava Views]] suite. However, since then Java has been more successful on the [[Server-side|server side]] of the Internet.\n\nThe platform consists of three major parts: the Java programming language, the [[Java Virtual Machine]] (JVM), and several [[Java API|Java Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)]]. The design of the Java platform is controlled by the vendor and user community through the [[Java Community Process]] (JCP).\n\nJava is an [[object-oriented programming]] language. Since its introduction in late 1995, it became one of the world's most popular programming languages.<ref>{{cite web\n |url = http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm\n |title = TIOBE Programming Community Index\n |accessdate =July 5, 2007\n |date=June 2007\n |publisher=TIOBE Software\n}} Java was ranked 1st as of June 2007, and has ranked 1st or 2nd in this index since its inception in 2001.</ref>\n\nJava programs are compiled to [[byte code]], which can be executed by any JVM, regardless of the environment.\n\nThe Java [[Application programming interface|API]]s provide an extensive set of library routines. These APIs evolved into the [[Java SE|''Standard Edition'' (Java SE)]], which provides basic infrastructure and GUI functionality; the [[Java EE|''Enterprise Edition'' (Java EE)]], aimed at large software companies implementing enterprise-class application servers; and the [[Java ME|''Micro Edition'' (Java ME)]], used to build software for devices with limited resources, such as mobile devices.\n\nOn November 13, 2006, Sun announced it would be licensing its Java implementation under the [[GNU General Public License]]; it released its [[Java compiler]] and JVM at that time.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sun.com/2006-1113/feature/story.jsp | title = Sun Opens Java | accessdate =January 25, 2007 | date= November 13, 2006 |  work=Sun Microsystems Web site | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070124154133/http://www.sun.com/2006-1113/feature/story.jsp| archivedate = January 24, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2009 Sun entered a battle with Microsoft and Adobe Systems, which promoted rival platforms to build software applications for the Internet.<ref name=Brandon>{{cite news|author=Brandon Bailey|title=Sun Microsystems, Adobe, Microsoft will battle for dominance in Internet software|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_11741973|work=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=February 20, 2009|accessdate=March 2, 2009}}</ref> [[JavaFX]] was a development platform for music, video and other applications that builds on the Java programming language.<ref name=Brandon/>\n\n===Office suite===\nIn 1999, Sun acquired the German software company StarDivision and with it the [[office suite]] [[StarOffice]], which Sun later released as [[OpenOffice.org]] under both [[GNU LGPL]] and the SISSL ([[Sun Industry Standards Source License]]). OpenOffice.org supported [[Microsoft Office]] file formats (though not perfectly), was available on many platforms (primarily Linux, Microsoft Windows, [[Mac OS X]], and Solaris) and was used in the [[open source community]].\n\nThe principal differences between StarOffice and OpenOffice.org were that StarOffice was supported by Sun, was available as either a single-user retail box kit or as per-user blocks of licensing for the enterprise, and included a wider range of fonts and document templates and a commercial quality spellchecker.<ref>{{cite web|title=Product Comparison|url=http://www.sun.com/software/star/openoffice/|work=Sun Microsystems|accessdate=September 18, 2008}}</ref>  StarOffice also contained commercially licensed functions and add-ons; in OpenOffice.org these were either replaced by open-source or free variants, or are not present at all. Both packages had native support for the [[OpenDocument]] format.\n\n===Virtualization and datacenter automation software===\n[[Image:VirtualBox2.png|thumb|300px|VirtualBox, purchased by Sun]]\nIn 2007, Sun announced the Sun xVM virtualization and datacenter automation product suite for commodity hardware. Sun also acquired VirtualBox in 2008. Earlier virtualization technologies from Sun like ''Dynamic System Domains'' and ''Dynamic Reconfiguration'' were specifically designed for high-end SPARC servers, and [[Logical Domains]] only supports the UltraSPARC T1/T2/T2 Plus server platforms. Sun marketed ''[[Sun Ops Center]]'' provisioning software for datacenter automation.\n\nOn the client side, Sun offered [[virtual desktop]] solutions. Desktop environments and applications could be hosted in a datacenter, with users accessing these environments from a wide range of client devices, including Microsoft Windows PCs, [[Sun Ray|Sun Ray virtual display clients]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] Macintoshes, PDAs or any combination of supported devices. A variety of networks were supported, from LAN to WAN or the public Internet. Virtual desktop products included [[Sun Ray Server Software]], [[Sun Secure Global Desktop]] and [[Oracle VDI|Sun Virtual Desktop Infrastructure]].\n\n===Database management systems===\nSun acquired MySQL AB, the developer of the MySQL database in 2008 for US$1&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sun Microsystems to acquire Innotek |url=http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2008/02/12/afx4645428.html |work=Forbes |date=February 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202173804/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2008/02/12/afx4645428.html |archivedate=December 2, 2010 }}</ref> CEO [[Jonathan I.

On the Java platform, Sun contributed to and supported [[Java DB]].\n\n===Other software===\nSun offered other software products for software development and infrastructure services. Many were developed in house; others came from acquisitions, including Tarantella, Waveset Technologies,<ref name=\"waveset\"/> SeeBeyond, and Vaau. Sun acquired many of the [[Netscape]] non-browser software products as part a deal involving Netscape's merger with [[AOL]].<ref>{{cite press release |title= Sun-Netscape alliance targets e-commerce with new brand identity |publisher=Sun Microsystems |date= January 25, 2000 | url= http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2000-01/sunflash.20000125.5.xml |accessdate=January 1, 2007 }}</ref> These software products were initially offered under the \"iPlanet\" brand; once the Sun-Netscape alliance ended, they were re-branded as \"[[Sun ONE]]\" (Sun Open Network Environment), and then the \"[[Sun Java System]]\".\n\nSun's middleware product was branded as the ''Java Enterprise System'' (or JES), and marketed for web and application serving, communication, calendaring, directory, identity management and [[service-oriented architecture]]. Sun's [[Open ESB]] and other software suites were available free of charge on systems running Solaris, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, [[HP-UX]], and Windows, with support available optionally.\n\nSun developed data center management software products, which included the ''[[Solaris Cluster]]'' high availability software, and a grid management package called ''[[Sun Grid Engine]]'' and firewall software such as [[SunScreen]].\nFor [[Network Equipment Provider]]s and telecommunications customers, Sun developed the Sun Netra High-Availability Suite.\n\nSun produced compilers and development tools under the ''[[Sun Studio (software)|Sun Studio]]'' brand, for building and developing Solaris and Linux applications.\nSun entered the [[software as a service]] (SaaS) market with [[zembly]], a social cloud-based [[computing platform]] and [[Project Kenai]], an open-source project hosting service.\n\n==Storage==\nSun sold its own storage systems to complement its system offerings; it has also made several storage-related acquisitions.\nOn June 2, 2005, Sun announced it would purchase [[Storage Technology Corporation]] (StorageTek) for US$4.1&nbsp;billion in cash, or $37.00 per share, a deal completed in August 2005.\n\nIn 2006, Sun introduced the [[Sun StorageTek 5800 System]], the first application-aware programmable storage solution. In 2008, Sun contributed the source code of the StorageTek 5800 System under the BSD license.<ref>{{cite web\n |url = http://opensolaris.org/os/project/honeycomb/\n |title = OpenSolaris Project: HoneyComb Fixed Content Storage\n |accessdate =February 28, 2008\n |date=February 2008\n |publisher=Sun Microsystems\n}}</ref>\n\nSun announced the [[Sun Open Storage]] platform in 2008 built with open source technologies.\nIn late 2008 Sun announced the [[Sun Storage 7000 Unified Storage]] systems (codenamed Amber Road).

Even before the introduction of the Sun Constellation System in 2007, Sun's products were in use in many of the [[TOP500]] systems and supercomputing centers:\n* [[Lustre (file system)|Lustre]]: used by seven of the top 10 supercomputers in 2008, as well as other industries that need high-performance storage: six major oil companies (including [[BP]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], and [[ExxonMobil]]), chip-design (including [[Synopsys]] and [[Sony]]), and the movie-industry (including [[Harry Potter film series|Harry Potter]] and [[Spider-Man]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}<ref>{{cite video\n  | title = Lustre File System presentation\n  | accessdate =January 28, 2008\n  | work=[[Google Video]]\n}}</ref>\n* Sun Fire X4500: used by high energy physics supercomputers to run dCache\n* Sun Grid Engine: a popular workload scheduler for clusters and computer farms\n* [[Sun Visualization System]]: allows users of the [[TeraGrid]] to remotely access the 3D rendering capabilities of the ''Maverick'' system at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]\n* [[Sun Modular Datacenter]] (Project Blackbox): two Sun MD S20 units are used by the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]]\n\nThe ''Sun HPC ClusterTools'' product was a set of [[Message Passing Interface]] (MPI) libraries and tools for running parallel jobs on Solaris HPC clusters. Beginning with version 7.0, Sun switched from its own implementation of MPI to [[Open MPI]], and donated engineering resources to the Open MPI project.\n\nSun was a participant in the [[OpenMP]] language committee. Sun Studio compilers and tools implemented the OpenMP specification for shared memory parallelization.\n\nIn 2006, Sun built the [[Tsubame (supercomputer)|''TSUBAME supercomputer'']], which was until June 2008 the fastest supercomputer in Asia. Sun built ''Ranger'' at the [[Texas Advanced Computing Center]] (TACC) in 2007. Ranger had a peak performance of over 500 TFLOPS, and was the 6th most powerful supercomputer on the TOP500 list in November 2008.\nSun announced an OpenSolaris distribution that integrated many of Sun's HPC products and other 3rd-party solutions.<ref>{{cite web\n  | url = http://opensolaris.org/os/project/hpc-stack/\n  | title = OpenSolaris Project: HPC Stack\n  | accessdate =June 4, 2011 |year= 2009 <!-- seems defunct? -->\n  | publisher=OpenSolaris Community\n}}</ref>\n\n==Staff==\n{{See also|List of Sun Microsystems employees}}\n\nNotable Sun employees included [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]], [[Whitfield Diffie]], [[Radia Perlman]], and [[Marc Tremblay]].
