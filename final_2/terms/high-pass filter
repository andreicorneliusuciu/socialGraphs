The amount of [[attenuation]] for each frequency depends on the filter design.  A high-pass [[filter (signal processing)|filter]] is usually modeled as a [[linear time-invariant system]]. It is sometimes called a '''low-cut filter''' or '''bass-cut filter'''.<ref name=Watkinson1998>{{cite book|last=Watkinson |first=John |title=The Art of Sound Reproduction |publisher=Focal Press |year=1998 |pages=268, 479 |isbn=0-240-51512-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=01u_Vm5i5isC&pg=PA479 |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref> High-pass filters have many uses, such as blocking DC from circuitry sensitive to non-zero average voltages or [[radio frequency]] devices. They can also be used in conjunction with a [[low-pass filter]] to produce a [[bandpass filter]].\n\n==First-order continuous-time implementation==\n[[Image:High pass filter.svg|framed|Figure&nbsp;1: A passive, analog, first-order high-pass filter, realized by an [[RC circuit]]]]\n\nThe simple first-order electronic high-pass filter shown in Figure&nbsp;1 is implemented by placing an input voltage across the series combination of a [[capacitor]] and a [[resistor]] and using the voltage across the resistor as an output. The product of the resistance and capacitance (''R''&times;''C'') is the [[time constant]] (&tau;); it is inversely proportional to the cutoff frequency ''f''<sub>''c''</sub>, that is,\n\n:<math>f_c = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\tau} = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi R C},\\,</math>\n\nwhere ''f''<sub>''c''</sub> is in [[hertz]], ''\u03c4'' is in [[second]]s, ''R'' is in [[Ohm (unit)|ohm]]s, and ''C'' is in [[farad]]s.\n\n[[Image:Active Highpass Filter RC.png|thumb|right|300px|Figure&nbsp;2: An active high-pass filter]]\nFigure&nbsp;2 shows an active electronic implementation of a first-order high-pass filter using an [[operational amplifier]]. In this case, the filter has a [[passband]] gain of -''R''<sub>2</sub>/''R''<sub>1</sub> and has a cutoff frequency of\n:<math>f_c = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\tau} = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi R_1 C},\\,</math>\nBecause this filter is [[passivity (engineering)|active]], it may have [[unity (mathematics)|non-unity]] passband gain. That is, high-frequency signals are inverted and amplified by ''R''<sub>2</sub>/''R''<sub>1</sub>.\n\n== Discrete-time realization ==\n{{for|another method of conversion from continuous- to discrete-time|Bilinear transform}}\n\nDiscrete-time high-pass filters can also be designed. Discrete-time filter design is beyond the scope of this article; however, a simple example comes from the conversion of the continuous-time high-pass filter above to a discrete-time realization. That is, the continuous-time behavior can be [[discrete signal|discretized]].\n\nFrom the circuit in Figure 1 above, according to [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's Laws]] and the definition of [[capacitance]]:\n\n:<math>\\begin{cases}\nV_{\\text{out}}(t) = I(t)\\, R &\\text{(V)}\\\\\nQ_c(t) = C \\, \\left( V_{\\text{in}}(t) - V_{\\text{out}}(t) \\right) &\\text{(Q)}\\\\\nI(t) = \\frac{\\operatorname{d} Q_c}{\\operatorname{d} t} &\\text{(I)}\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nwhere <math>Q_c(t)</math> is the charge stored in the capacitor at time <math>t</math>. Substituting Equation&nbsp;(Q) into Equation&nbsp;(I) and then Equation&nbsp;(I) into Equation&nbsp;(V) gives:\n\n:<math>V_{\\text{out}}(t) = \\overbrace{C \\, \\left( \\frac{\\operatorname{d} V_{\\text{in}}}{\\operatorname{d}t} - \\frac{\\operatorname{d} V_{\\text{out}}}{\\operatorname{d}t} \\right)}^{I(t)} \\, R = R C \\, \\left( \\frac{ \\operatorname{d} V_{\\text{in}}}{\\operatorname{d}t} - \\frac{\\operatorname{d} V_{\\text{out}}}{\\operatorname{d}t} \\right)</math>\n\nThis equation can be discretized. For simplicity, assume that samples of the input and output are taken at evenly spaced points in time separated by <math>\\Delta_T</math> time. Let the samples of <math>V_{\\text{in}}</math> be represented by the sequence <math>(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)</math>, and let <math>V_{\\text{out}}</math> be represented by the sequence <math>(y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n)</math> which correspond to the same points in time.<!--\n\n:Replace <math>V_{in}(t)</math> with <math>x_i</math>\n:Replace <math>V_{out}(t)</math> with <math>y_i</math>\n:Replace <math>dV_{out}</math> with <math>y_{i} - y_{i-1}</math>\n:Replace <math>dV_{in}</math> with <math>x_{i} - x_{i-1}</math>\n:Replace <math>dt</math> with <math>\\Delta_T</math>\n\n--> Making these substitutions:\n\n:<math>y_i = R C \\, \\left( \\frac{x_i - x_{i-1}}{\\Delta_T} - \\frac{y_i - y_{i-1}}{\\Delta_T} \\right)</math>\n\nAnd rearranging terms gives the [[recurrence relation]]\n\n:<math>y_i = \\overbrace{\\frac{RC}{RC + \\Delta_T} y_{i-1}}^{\\text{Decaying contribution from prior inputs}} + \\overbrace{\\frac{RC}{RC + \\Delta_T} \\left( x_i -  x_{i-1} \\right)}^{\\text{Contribution from change in input}} </math>\n\nThat is, this discrete-time implementation of a simple continuous-time RC high-pass filter is\n\n:<math>y_i = \\alpha y_{i-1} + \\alpha (x_{i} - x_{i-1}) \\qquad \\text{where} \\qquad \\alpha \\triangleq \\frac{RC}{RC + \\Delta_T}</math>\n\nBy definition, <math>0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 1</math>. The expression for parameter <math>\\alpha</math> yields the equivalent [[time constant]] <math>RC</math> in terms of the sampling period <math>\\Delta_T</math> and <math>\\alpha</math>:\n\n:<math>RC = \\Delta_T \\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha} \\right)</math>.\nRecalling that\n:<math>f_c=\\frac{1}{2\\pi RC}</math> so <math>RC=\\frac{1}{2\\pi f_c}</math>\nthen <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>f_c</math> are related by:\n:<math>\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\Delta_T f_c + 1}</math>\nand\n:<math>f_c=\\frac{1-\\alpha}{2\\pi \\alpha \\Delta_T}</math>.\n\nIf <math>\\alpha = 0.5</math>, then the <math>RC</math> time constant equal to the sampling period. If <math>\\alpha \\ll 0.5</math>, then <math>RC</math> is significantly smaller than the sampling interval, and <math>RC \\approx \\alpha \\Delta_T</math>.\n\n=== Algorithmic implementation ===\nThe filter recurrence relation provides a way to determine the output samples in terms of the input samples and the preceding output. The following [[pseudocode]] algorithm will simulate the effect of a high-pass filter on a series of digital samples:\n\n  // Return RC high-pass filter output samples, given input samples,\n  // time interval ''dt'', and time constant ''RC''\n  '''function''' highpass(''real[0..n]'' x, ''real'' dt, ''real'' RC)\n    '''var''' ''real[0..n]'' y\n    '''var''' ''real'' \u03b1 := RC / (RC + dt)\n    y[0] := x[0]\n    '''for''' i '''from''' 1 '''to''' n\n      y[i] := \u03b1 * y[i-1] + \u03b1 * (x[i] - x[i-1])\n    '''return''' y\n\nThe loop which calculates each of the <math>n</math> outputs can be [[code refactoring|refactored]] into the equivalent:\n\n    '''for''' i '''from''' 1 '''to''' n\n      y[i] := \u03b1 * (y[i-1] + x[i] - x[i-1])\n\nHowever, the earlier form shows how the parameter \u03b1 changes the impact of the prior output <tt>y[i-1]</tt> and current ''change'' in input <tt>(x[i] - x[i-1])</tt>. In particular,\n* A large \u03b1 implies that the output will decay very slowly but will also be strongly influenced by even small changes in input. By the relationship between parameter \u03b1 and [[time constant]] <math>RC</math> above, a large \u03b1 corresponds to a large <math>RC</math> and therefore a low [[corner frequency]] of the filter. Hence, this case corresponds to a high-pass filter with a very narrow stop band. Because it is excited by small changes and tends to hold its prior output values for a long time, it can pass relatively low frequencies. However, a constant input (i.e., an input with <tt>(x[i] - x[i-1])=0</tt>) will always decay to zero, as would be expected with a high-pass filter with a large <math>RC</math>.\n* A small \u03b1 implies that the output will decay quickly and will require large changes in the input (i.e., <tt>(x[i] - x[i-1])</tt> is large) to cause the output to change much. By the relationship between parameter \u03b1 and time constant <math>RC</math> above, a small \u03b1 corresponds to a small <math>RC</math> and therefore a high corner frequency of the filter. Hence, this case corresponds to a high-pass filter with a very wide stop band. Because it requires large (i.e., fast) changes and tends to quickly forget its prior output values, it can only pass relatively high frequencies, as would be expected with a high-pass filter with a small <math>RC</math>.\n\n==Applications==\n===Audio===\nHigh-pass filters have many applications. They are used as part of an [[audio crossover]] to direct high frequencies to a [[tweeter]] while attenuating bass signals which could interfere with, or damage, the speaker. When such a filter is built into a [[loudspeaker]] cabinet it is normally a [[passive filter]] that also includes a [[low-pass filter]] for the [[woofer]] and so often employs both a capacitor and [[inductor]] (although very simple high-pass filters for tweeters can consist of a series capacitor and nothing else).\nAs an example, the [[High-pass filter#First-order continuous-time implementation|formula above]], applied to a tweeter with R=10 Ohm, will determine the capacitor value for a cut-off frequency of 5&nbsp;kHz.\n<math>C = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi f R} = \\frac{1}{6.28 \\times 5000 \\times 10} =  3.18 \\times 10^{-6} </math>, or approx 3.2 \u03bcF.\n\nAn alternative, which provides good quality sound without inductors (which are prone to parasitic coupling, are expensive, and may have significant internal resistance) is to employ [[bi-amplification]] with [[active filter|active RC filters]] or active digital filters with separate power amplifiers for each [[loudspeaker]]. Such low-current and low-voltage [[line level]] crossovers are called [[active crossover]]s.<ref name=Watkinson1998/>\n\nRumble filters are high-pass filters applied to the removal of unwanted sounds near to the lower end of the [[audible range]] or below. For example, noises (e.g., footsteps, or motor noises from [[record player]]s and [[tape deck]]s) may be removed because they are undesired or may overload the [[RIAA equalization]] circuit of the [[preamp]].<ref name=Watkinson1998/>\n\nHigh-pass filters are also used for [[AC coupling]] at the inputs of many [[audio power amplifier]]s, for preventing the amplification of DC currents which may harm the amplifier, rob the amplifier of headroom, and generate waste heat at the [[loudspeaker]]s [[voice coil]]. One amplifier, the [[professional audio]] model DC300 made by [[Crown International]] beginning in the 1960s, did not have high-pass filtering at all, and could be used to amplify the DC signal of a common 9-volt battery at the input to supply 18 volts DC in an emergency for [[mixing console]] power.<ref name=\"Andrews2010\">{{cite web|url=http://recforums.prosoundweb.com/index.php/m/462291/0/ |title=Re: Running the board for a show this big? |last=Andrews |first=Keith |author2=posting as ssltech |date=January 11, 2010 |work=Recording, Engineering & Production |publisher=ProSoundWeb |accessdate=9 March 2010}}</ref> However, that model's basic design has been superseded by newer designs such as the Crown Macro-Tech series developed in the late 1980s which included 10&nbsp;Hz high-pass filtering on the inputs and switchable 35&nbsp;Hz high-pass filtering on the outputs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crownaudio.com/pdf/amps/128313.pdf |title=Operation Manual: MA-5002VZ |year=2007 |work=Macro-Tech Series |publisher=Crown Audio |accessdate=March 9, 2010 }}</ref> Another example is the [[QSC Audio]] PLX amplifier series which includes an internal 5&nbsp;Hz high-pass filter which is applied to the inputs whenever the optional 50 and 30&nbsp;Hz high-pass filters are turned off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.qscaudio.com/pdfs/plxuser.pdf |title=User Manual: PLX Series Amplifiers |year=1999 |publisher=QSC Audio |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:75 Hz HPF on Smaart.jpg|thumb|A 75&nbsp;Hz \"low cut\" filter from an input channel of a [[Mackie]] 1402 [[mixing console]] as measured by [[Smaart]] software. This high-pass filter has a slope of 18&nbsp;dB per octave.]]\nMixing consoles often include high-pass filtering at each [[channel strip]]. Some models have fixed-slope, fixed-frequency high-pass filters at 80 or 100&nbsp;Hz that can be engaged; other models have sweepable high-pass filters, filters of fixed slope that can be set within a specified frequency range, such as from 20 to 400&nbsp;Hz on the [[Midas Consoles|Midas]] Heritage 3000, or 20 to 20,000&nbsp;Hz on the [[Yamaha]] [[M7CL]] [[digital mixing console]]. Veteran systems engineer and live sound mixer Bruce Main recommends that high-pass filters be engaged for most mixer input sources, except for those such as [[bass drum|kick drum]], [[bass guitar]] and piano, sources which will have useful low frequency sounds. Main writes that [[DI unit]] inputs (as opposed to [[microphone]] inputs) do not need high-pass filtering as they are not subject to modulation by low-frequency [[Stage wash (audio)|stage wash]]\u2014low frequency sounds coming from the [[subwoofer]]s or the [[public address]] system and wrapping around to the stage. Main indicates that high-pass filters are commonly used for directional microphones which have a [[Proximity effect (audio)|proximity effect]]\u2014a low-frequency boost for very close sources. This low frequency boost commonly causes problems up to 200 or 300&nbsp;Hz, but Main notes that he has seen microphones that benefit from a 500&nbsp;Hz high-pass filter setting on the console.<ref name=Main2010>{{cite journal|last=Main |first=Bruce |date=February 16, 2010 |title=Cut 'Em Off At The Pass: Effective Uses Of High-Pass Filtering |journal=Live Sound International |publisher=ProSoundWeb, EH Publishing|location=Framingham, Massachusetts}}</ref>\n\n===Image===\n[[image:High Pass Filter Example.jpg|right|thumb|Example of high-pass filter applied to the right half of a photograph.
