Structural integrity is the ability of an item to hold together under a load, including its own weight, resisting breakage or bending. It assures that the construction will perform its designed function, during reasonable use, for as long as the designed life of the structure. Items are constructed with structural integrity to ensure that [[catastrophic failure]] does not occur, which can result in injuries, severe damage, death, and/or monetary losses.\n\n''Structural failure'' refers to the loss of structural integrity, which is the loss of the [[Structural load|load]]-carrying capacity of a component or member within a [[Architectural structure|structure]], or of the structure itself. Structural failure is initiated when the [[List of building materials|material]] is stressed beyond its [[Strength of materials|strength]] limit, thus causing fracture or excessive [[Deformation (engineering)|deformations]]. In a well-designed system, a localized failure should not cause immediate or even progressive collapse of the entire structure. Ultimate failure strength is one of the [[limit state design|limit states]] that must be accounted for in [[structural engineering]] and [[structural design]].\n\n==Introduction==\nStructural integrity is the ability of a structure or a component to withstand a designed service load, resisting structural failure due to [[fracture]], [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]], or [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]]. Structural integrity is a concept often used in [[engineering]], to produce items that will not only function adequately for their designed purposes, but also to function for a desired [[service life]].\n\nTo construct an item with structural integrity, an engineer must first consider the mechanical properties of a material, such as [[toughness]], [[Strength of materials|strength]], weight, [[hardness]], and [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], and then determine a suitable size, thickness, or shape that will withstand the desired load for a long life. A material with high strength may resist bending, but, without adequate toughness, it may have to be very large to support a load and prevent breaking. However, a material with low strength will likely bend under a load even though its high toughness prevents fracture. A material with low elasticity may be able to support a load with minimum [[deflection (engineering)|deflection]] (flexing), but can be prone to fracture from fatigue, while a material with high elasitcity may be more resistant to fatigue, but may produce too much deflection unless the object is drastically oversized.\n\nStructural integrity must always be considered in engineering when designing buildings, gears or transmissions, support structures, mechanical components, or any other item that may bear a load. The engineer must carefully balance the properties of a material with its size and the load it is intended to support. Bridge supports, for instance, need good [[yield strength]], whereas the bolts that hold them need good [[shear strength|shear]] and [[tensile strength]]. Springs need good elasticity, but [[lathe]] tooling needs high rigidity and minimal deflection. When applied to a structure, the integrity of each component must be carefully matched to its individual application, so that the entire structure can support its load without failure due to weak links. When a weak link breaks, it can put more stress on other parts of the structure, leading to [[cascading failure]]s.<ref>''Introduction to Engineering Design: Modelling, Synthesis and Problem Solving Strategies'' By Andrew E. Samuel, John Weir -- Elsevier 1999 Page 3--5</ref><ref>''Structural Integrity of Fasteners, Volume 2'' Edited by Pir M. Toor -- ASTM 2000</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe need to build structure with integrity goes back as far as recorded history. Houses needed to be able to support their own weight, plus the weight of the inhabitants. Castles needed to be fortified to withstand assaults from invaders. Tools needed to be strong and tough enough to do their jobs. However, it was not until the 1920s that the science of [[fracture mechanics]], namely the brittleness of glass, was described by [[Alan Arnold Griffith]]. Even so, a real need for the science did not present itself until World War II, when over 200 welded-steel ships broke in half due to brittle fracture, caused by a combination of the stresses created from the welding process, temperature changes, and the stress points created at the square corners of the bulkheads. The squared windows in the [[De Havilland Comet]] aircraft of the 1950s caused stress points which allowed cracks to form, causing the pressurized cabins to explode in mid-flight. Failures in pressurized boiler tanks leading to [[boiler explosion]] were a common problem during this era, causing severe damage. The growing sizes of bridges and buildings began to lead to even greater catastrophes and loss of life. The need to build constructions with structural integrity led to great advances in the fields of material sciences and fracture mechanics.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Assuring structural integrity in army systems'' By National Research Council (U.S.).

Collacott -- Chapman and Hall 1985 Page 1--5</ref>\n\n==Types of failure==\nFailure of a structure can occur from many types of problems. Most of these problems are unique to the type of structure or to the various industries. However, most can be traced to one of five main causes.\n\n*The first, whether due to size, shape, or the choice of material, is that the structure is not strong and tough enough to support the load. If the structure or component is not strong enough, catastrophic failure can occur when the overstressed construction reaches a critical stress level. \n*The second is instability, whether due to geometry, design or material choice, causing the structure to fail from fatigue or corrosion. These types of failure often occur at stress points, such as squared corners or from bolt holes being too close to the material's edge, causing cracks to slowly form and then progress through cyclic loading. Failure generally occurs when the cracks reach a critical length, causing breakage to happen suddenly under normal loading conditions. \n*The third type of failure is caused by manufacturing errors. This may be due to improper selection of materials, incorrect sizing, improper [[heat treating]], failing to adhere to the design, or shoddy workmanship. These types of failure can occur at any time, and are usually unpredictable.\n*The fourth is also unpredictable, from the use of defective materials. The material may have been improperly manufactured, or may have been damaged from prior use.\n*The fifth cause of failure is from lack of consideration of unexpected problems. Vandalism, sabotage, and natural disasters can all overstress a structure to the point of failure. Improper training of those who use and maintain the construction can also overstress it, leading to potential failures.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n== Notable integrity ==\n* [[Akashi Kaiky\u014d Bridge]], a bridge\n* [[Burj Khalifa]], a building\n* [[Ameralik Span]], a span\n\n==Notable failures==\n{{further|List of structural failures and collapses}}\n\n===Bridges===\n{{See also|List of bridge disasters}}\n\n====Dee bridge====\n{{Main|Dee bridge disaster}}\n[[File:Dee bridge disaster.jpg|thumb|The Dee bridge after its collapse]]\nOn 24 May 1847 the new railway bridge over the river Dee collapsed as a train passed over it, with the loss of 5 lives. It was designed by [[Robert Stephenson]], using [[cast iron]] girders reinforced with [[wrought iron]] struts. The bridge collapse was the subject of one of the first formal inquiries into a structural failure. The result of the inquiry was that the design of the structure was fundamentally flawed, as the wrought iron did not reinforce the cast iron at all, and that, owing to repeated flexing, the casting had suffered a brittle failure due to fatigue.<ref>Petroski, H. (1994) p.81</ref>\n\n====First Tay Rail Bridge====\n{{Main|Tay Bridge disaster}}\nThe Dee bridge disaster was followed by a number of [[cast iron]] bridge collapses, including the collapse of the first [[Tay Rail Bridge]] on 28 December 1879. Like the Dee bridge, the Tay collapsed when a train passed over it causing 75 people to lose their lives. The bridge failed because of poorly made cast iron, and the failure of the designer [[Thomas Bouch]] to consider wind loading on the bridge. The collapse resulted in cast iron largely being replaced by steel construction, and a complete redesign in 1890 of the [[Forth Railway Bridge]]. As a result, the Forth Bridge was the first entirely steel bridge in the world.<ref name=Tacoma>{{cite book|title=In the Wake of Tacoma: Suspension Bridges and the Quest for Aerodynamic Stability|author=Scott, Richard|year=2001|publisher=ASCE Publications|isbn=0-7844-0542-5|pages=139}}</ref>\n\n====First Tacoma Narrows Bridge====\n{{Main|Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)}}\nThe 1940 collapse of the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge is sometimes characterized in physics textbooks as a classic example of resonance, although this description is misleading. The catastrophic vibrations that destroyed the bridge were not due to simple mechanical resonance, but to a more complicated oscillation between the bridge and winds passing through it, known as [[aeroelastic flutter]]. [[Robert H. Scanlan]], father of the field of bridge aerodynamics, wrote an article about this misunderstanding.<ref>K. Billah and R. Scanlan (1991), ''Resonance, Tacoma Narrows Bridge Failure, and Undergraduate Physics Textbooks'', [[American Journal of Physics]], 59(2), 118--124 [http://www.ketchum.org/billah/Billah-Scanlan.pdf (PDF)]</ref> This collapse, and the research that followed, led to an increased understanding of wind/structure interactions.

In April 1995, cracks began to appear in the ceiling of the fifth floor of the store's south wing due to the presence of an air-conditioning unit on the weakened roof of the poorly built structure. On the morning of 29 June, as the number of cracks in the ceiling increased dramatically, the top floor was closed and managers shut the air conditioning off. The store management failed to shut the building down or issue formal evacuation orders; however, the executives themselves left the premises as a precaution. Five hours before the collapse, the first of several loud bangs was heard emanating from the top floors, as the vibration of the air conditioning caused the cracks in the slabs to widen further. Amid customer reports of vibration, the air conditioning was turned off but the cracks in the floors had already grown to 10&nbsp;cm. At about 5:00&nbsp;p.m. local time, the fifth floor ceiling began to sink; by 5:57&nbsp;p.m., the roof gave way, and the air conditioning unit crashed through into the already-overloaded fifth floor, trapping more than 1,500 people and killing 502.\n\n====Ronan Point====\n{{Main|Ronan Point}}\nOn 16 May 1968, the 22-story residential tower [[Ronan Point]] in the [[London Borough of Newham]] collapsed when a relatively small gas explosion on the 18th floor caused a structural wall panel to be blown away from the building. The tower was constructed of [[precast]] concrete, and the failure of the single panel caused one entire corner of the building to collapse. The panel was able to be blown out because there was insufficient reinforcement steel passing between the panels. This also meant that the loads carried by the panel could not be redistributed to other adjacent panels, because there was no route for the forces to follow. As a result of the collapse, building regulations were overhauled to prevent [[disproportionate collapse]] and the understanding of precast concrete detailing was greatly advanced. Many similar buildings were altered or demolished as a result of the collapse.<ref name=ConstructionFailure>{{cite book|title=Construction Failure|author1=Feld, Jacob |author2=Carper, Kenneth L. |year=1997|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=0-471-57477-5|pages=8}}</ref>\n\n====Oklahoma City bombing====\n{{Main|Oklahoma City bombing}}\nOn 19 April 1995, the nine-story concrete framed [[Alfred P.

The bomb, though large, caused a significantly disproportionate collapse of the structure. The bomb blew all the glass off the front of the building and completely shattered a ground floor [[reinforced concrete column]] (see [[brisance]]). At second story level a wider column spacing existed, and loads from upper story columns were transferred into fewer columns below by girders at second floor level. The removal of one of the lower story columns caused neighbouring columns to fail due to the extra load, eventually leading to the complete collapse of the central portion of the building.

Perimeter columns and floors were also weakened by the heat of the fires, causing the floors to sag and exerting an inward force on exterior walls of the building.

The mast first bent and then snapped at roughly half its height. It destroyed at its collapse a small mobile crane of Mostostal Zabrze. As all workers left the mast before the exchange procedures, there were no fatalities, in contrast to the similar collapse of [[WLBT Tower]] in 1997.\n\n====Hyatt Regency walkway====\n{{Main|Hyatt Regency walkway collapse}}\n[[File:HRWalkway.svg|right|thumbnail|Design change on the Hyatt Regency walkways.]]On 17 July 1981, two suspended walkways through the lobby of the [[Hyatt Regency]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], collapsed, killing 114 and injuring more than 200 people<ref>{{cite book|title=Why Buildings Fall Down|author1=M. Levy |author2=M. Salvadori |publisher=Norton & Co.|year=1992}}</ref> at a tea dance. The collapse was due to a late change in design, altering the method in which the rods supporting the walkways were connected to them, and inadvertently doubling the forces on the connection. The failure highlighted the need for good communication between design engineers and contractors, and rigorous checks on designs and especially on contractor-proposed design changes. The failure is a standard case study on engineering courses around the world, and is used to teach the importance of ethics in engineering.<ref>Feld, J.; Carper, K.L.
