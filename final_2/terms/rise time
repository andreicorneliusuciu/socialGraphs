However, this statement is incorrect since the 0%\u2013100% rise time for an overdamped 2nd order control system is infinite, similarly to the one of an [[Rise time#One-stage low-pass RC network|RC network]]: this statement is repeated also in the second edition of the book {{harv|Levine|2011|p=9-3 (313)}}.</ref> According to {{harvtxt|Orwiler|1969|p=22}}, the term \"rise time\" applies to either positive or negative [[step response]], even if a displayed negative excursion is popularly termed [[fall time]].<ref>Again according to {{harvtxt|Orwiler|1969|p=22}}.</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nRise time is an analog parameter of fundamental importance in [[electronics|high speed electronics]], since it is a measure of the ability of a circuit to respond to fast input signals.<ref>According to {{harvtxt|Valley|Wallman|1948|p=72}}, \"''The most important characteristics of the reproduction of a leading edge  of a rectangular pulse or step function are the rise time, usually measured from 10 to 90 per cent, and the \"[[Overshoot (signal)|overshoot]]\"''\". And according to {{harvtxt|Cherry|Hooper|1969|p=306}}, \"''The two most significant parameters in the square-wave response of an [[amplifier]] are its rise time and percentage tilt''\".</ref> Many efforts over the years have been made to reduce the rise times of generators, analog and digital circuits, measuring and data transmission equipment, focused on the research of faster [[electronic device|electron devices]] and on techniques of reduction of stray circuit parameters (mainly capacitances and inductances). For applications outside the realm of high speed [[electronics]], long (compared to the attainable state of the art) rise times are sometimes desirable: examples are the [[Dimmer|dimming]] of a light, where a longer rise-time results, amongst other things, in a longer life for the bulb, or in the control of analog signals by digital ones by means of an [[analog switch]], where a longer rise time means lower capacitive feedthrough, and thus lower coupling [[noise]] to the controlled analog signal lines.\n\n===Factors affecting rise time===\nFor a given system output, its rise time depend both on the rise time of input signal and on the characteristics of the [[system]].<ref>See {{harv|Orwiler|1969|pp=27\u201329}} and the \"[[Rise time#Rise time of cascaded blocks|Rise time of cascaded blocks]]\" section.</ref>\n\nFor example, rise time values in a resistive circuit are primarily due to stray [[capacitance]] and [[inductance]] in the circuit. Because every [[electrical network|circuit]] has not only [[electrical resistance|resistance]], but also [[capacitance]] and [[inductance]], a delay in voltage and/or current at the load is apparent until the [[Steady state theory|steady state]] is reached. In a pure [[RC circuit]], the output risetime (10% to 90%) is approximately equal to {{math|2.2 ''RC''}}.<ref>See for example {{harv|Valley|Wallman|1948|p=73}}, {{harv|Orwiler|1969|loc=p. 22 and p. 30}} or the \"[[Rise time#One-stage low-pass RC network|One-stage low-pass RC network]]\" section.</ref>\n\n===Alternative definitions===\nOther definitions of rise time, apart from the one given by the [[#{{harvid|National Communication Systems|1997}}|Federal Standard 1037C (1997]]  by , p. R-22) and its slight generalization given by {{harvtxt|Levine|1996|p=158}}, are occasionally used:<ref>See {{harv|Valley|Wallman|1948|loc=p. 72, footnote 1}} and {{Harv|Elmore|1948|p=56}}.</ref> these alternative definitions differ respect to the standard one not only for the reference levels considered . For example, the time interval graphically corresponding to the intercept points of the tangent drawn through the 50% point of the step function response is occasionally used.<ref>See {{harv|Valley|Wallman|1948|loc=p. 72, footnote 1}} and {{Harv|Elmore|1948|loc=p. 56 and p. 57, fig. 2a}}.</ref> Another definition, introduced by {{Harvtxt|Elmore|1948|p=57}},<ref>See also {{harv|Petitt|McWhorter|1961|pp=109\u2013111}}.</ref> uses some concepts from [[statistics]] and [[probability theory]].
