[[Stress (physics)|Stress]] acting on a material when fast fracture occurs is less than the material's [[Yield (engineering)|yield stress]]. A very representative example of this is what happens when poking a blown up balloon with a needle, that is, fast fracture of the balloon's material.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Yield (engineering)]]\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fast Fracture}}\n[[Category:Construction terminology]]\n\n{{Tech-stub}}"}]}}}}
