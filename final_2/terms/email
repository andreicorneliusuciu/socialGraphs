Email operates across [[computer network]]s, which in the 2010s is primarily the [[Internet]]. Some early email systems required the author and the recipient to both be [[Online and offline|online]] at the same time, in common with [[instant messaging]]. Today's email systems are based on a [[store-and-forward]] model. Email [[Server (computing)|servers]] accept, forward, deliver, and store messages. Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need to connect only briefly, typically to a [[Message transfer agent|mail server]], for as long as it takes to send or receive messages.\n\nOriginally an [[ASCII]] text-only communications medium, Internet email was extended by [[Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions]] (MIME) to carry text in other character sets and multimedia content attachments. [[International email]], with internationalized email addresses using [[UTF-8]], has been standardized, but as of 2016 not widely adopted.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe history of modern Internet email services reaches back to the early [[ARPANET]], with standards for encoding email messages published as early as 1973 (RFC 561). An email message sent in the early 1970s looks very similar to a basic email sent today. Email played an important part in creating the Internet,<ref>{{Harv|Partridge|2008}}</ref> and the conversion from ARPANET to the Internet in the early 1980s produced the core of the current services.\n\n==Terminology==\nHistorically, the term ''electronic mail'' was used generically for any electronic document transmission. For example, several writers in the early 1970s used the term to describe [[fax]] document transmission.<ref>Ron Brown, Fax invades the mail market, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry64sjvOmLkC&pg=PA218 New Scientist], Vol. 56, No. 817 (Oct., 26, 1972), pages 218\u2013221.</ref><ref>Herbert P.

This often involved addresses such as:\n:hubhost!middlehost!edgehost!user@uucpgateway.somedomain.example.com\nwhich routes mail to a user with a \"[[UUCP#Mail routing|bang path]]\" address at a UUCP host.\n\n==Operation==\nThe diagram to the right shows a typical sequence of events<ref>{{cite video|title=How E-mail Works|medium=internet video|publisher=howstuffworks.com|year=2008|url=http://www.webcastr.com/videos/informational/how-email-works.html}}</ref> that takes place when sender [[Placeholder names in cryptography|Alice]] transmits a message using a [[E-mail client|mail user agent]] (MUA) addressed to the [[email address]] of the recipient.\n<span style=\"float:right\">[[File:email.svg|400px|Email operation]]</span>\n# The MUA formats the message in email format and uses the submission protocol, a profile of the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP), to send the message to the local [[mail submission agent]] (MSA), in this case ''smtp.a.org''.\n# The MSA determines the destination address provided in the SMTP protocol (not from the message header), in this case ''bob@b.org''. The part before the @ sign is the ''local part'' of the address, often the [[username]] of the recipient, and the part after the @ sign is a [[domain name]]. The MSA resolves a domain name to determine the [[fully qualified domain name]] of the [[Message transfer agent|mail server]] in the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS).\n# The [[DNS server]] for the domain ''b.org'' (''ns.b.org'') responds with any [[MX record]]s listing the mail exchange servers for that domain, in this case ''mx.b.org'', a [[message transfer agent]] (MTA) server run by the recipient's ISP.<ref>[https://dnsdb.cit.cornell.edu/explain_mx.html \"MX Record Explanation\"], it.cornell.edu</ref>\n# smtp.a.org sends the message to mx.b.org using SMTP. This server may need to forward the message to other MTAs before the message reaches the final [[message delivery agent]] (MDA).\n# The MDA delivers it to the [[Email Mailbox|mailbox]] of user ''bob''.\n# Bob's MUA picks up the message using either the [[Post Office Protocol]] (POP3) or the [[Internet Message Access Protocol]] (IMAP).\n\nIn addition to this example, alternatives and complications exist in the email system:\n* Alice or Bob may use a client connected to a corporate email system, such as [[IBM]] [[Lotus Notes]] or [[Microsoft]] [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Exchange]]. These systems often have their own internal email format and their clients typically communicate with the email server using a vendor-specific, proprietary protocol. The server sends or receives email via the Internet through the product's Internet mail gateway which also does any necessary reformatting. If Alice and Bob work for the same company, the entire transaction may happen completely within a single corporate email system.\n* Alice may not have a MUA on her computer but instead may connect to a [[webmail]] service.\n* Alice's computer may run its own MTA, so avoiding the transfer at step 1.\n* Bob may pick up his email in many ways, for example logging into mx.b.org and reading it directly, or by using a webmail service.\n* Domains usually have several mail exchange servers so that they can continue to accept mail even if the primary is not available.\n\nMany MTAs used to accept messages for any recipient on the Internet and do their best to deliver them. Such MTAs are called ''[[open mail relay]]s''. This was very important in the early days of the Internet when network connections were unreliable.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  However, this mechanism proved to be exploitable by originators of [[email spam|unsolicited bulk email]] and as a consequence open mail relays have become rare,<ref name=\"IMCR-016\">{{cite web|url=http://www.imc.org/ube-relay.html |title=Allowing Relaying in SMTP: A Series of Surveys |accessdate=2008-04-13 |last=Hoffman |first=Paul |date=2002-08-20 |work=IMC Reports |publisher=[[Internet Mail Consortium]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118121843/http://www.imc.org/ube-relay.html |archivedate=2007-01-18 }}</ref> and many MTAs do not accept messages from open mail relays.\n\n==Message format {{anchor|Internet Message Format}}==\nThe Internet email message format is now defined by RFC 5322, with multimedia content attachments being defined in RFC 2045 through RFC 2049, collectively called ''[[Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions]]'' or ''MIME''. RFC 5322 replaced the earlier RFC 2822 in 2008, and in turn RFC 2822 in 2001 replaced RFC 822 \u2013 which had been the standard for Internet email for nearly 20 years. Published in 1982, RFC 822 was based on the earlier RFC 733 for the [[ARPANET]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Ken|last=Simpson|title=An update to the email standards|date=October 3, 2008|publisher=MailChannels Blog Entry|url= http://blog.mailchannels.com/2008/10/update-to-email-standards.html}}</ref>\n\nInternet email messages consist of two major sections, the message header and the message body.  The header is structured into [[Field (computer science)|fields]] such as From, To, CC, Subject, Date, and other information about the email. In the process of transporting email messages between systems, SMTP communicates delivery parameters and information using message header fields. The body contains the message, as unstructured text, sometimes containing a [[signature block]] at the end. The header is separated from the body by a blank line.\n\n===Message header===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Bracket]] -->\nEach message has exactly one [[Header (computing)|header]], which is structured into [[Field (computer science)|fields]]. Each field has a name and a value. RFC 5322 specifies the precise syntax.\n\nInformally, each line of text in the header that begins with a [[Printable characters|printable character]] begins a separate field. The field name starts in the first character of the line and ends before the separator character \":\". The separator is then followed by the field value (the \"body\" of the field). The value is continued onto subsequent lines if those lines have a space or tab as their first character. Field names and values are restricted to 7-bit [[ASCII]] characters. Non-ASCII values may be represented using MIME [[MIME#Encoded-Word|encoded words]].\n\n====Header fields====\nEmail header fields can be multi-line, and each line should be at most 78 characters long and in no event more than 998 characters long.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322|title=RFC 5322, Internet Message Format|author=P.

Identification Fields |publisher=Tools.ietf.org |date=October 2008|accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref>\n* ''From'': The [[email address]], and optionally the name of the author(s). In many email clients not changeable except through changing account settings.\n* ''Date'': The local time and date when the message was written. Like the ''From:'' field, many email clients fill this in automatically when sending. The recipient's client may then display the time in the format and time zone local to him/her.\n\nRFC 3864 describes registration procedures for message header fields at the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]]; it provides for [http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/perm-headers.html permanent] and [http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/prov-headers.html provisional] field names, including also fields defined for MIME, netnews, and HTTP, and referencing relevant RFCs. Common header fields for email include:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5064 |title=RFC 5064 |publisher=Tools.ietf.org|date=December 2007 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref>\n\n* ''To'': The email address(es), and optionally name(s) of the message's recipient(s). Indicates primary recipients (multiple allowed), for secondary recipients see Cc: and Bcc: below.\n* ''Subject'': A brief summary of the topic of the message. [[E-mail subject abbreviations|Certain abbreviations]] are commonly used in the subject, including [[E-mail subject abbreviations|\"RE:\" and \"FW:\"]].\n* ''Cc'': [[Carbon copy]]; Many email clients will mark email in one's inbox differently depending on whether they are in the To: or Cc: list. (''Bcc'': [[Blind carbon copy]]; addresses are usually only specified during SMTP delivery, and not usually listed in the message header.)\n* [[Content-Type]]: Information about how the message is to be displayed, usually a [[MIME]] type.\n* ''Precedence'': commonly with values \"bulk\", \"junk\", or \"list\"; used to indicate that automated \"vacation\" or \"out of office\" responses should not be returned for this mail, e.g. to prevent vacation notices from being sent to all other subscribers of a mailing list. [[Sendmail]] uses this field to affect prioritization of queued email, with \"Precedence: special-delivery\" messages delivered sooner. With modern high-bandwidth networks, delivery priority is less of an issue than it once was. [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]] respects a fine-grained automatic response suppression mechanism, the ''X-Auto-Response-Suppress'' field.<ref>Microsoft, Auto Response Suppress, 2010, [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee219609(v=EXCHG.80).aspx microsoft reference], 2010 Sep 22</ref>\n* ''Message-ID'': Also an automatically generated field; used to prevent multiple delivery and for reference in In-Reply-To: (see below).\n* ''In-Reply-To'': [[Message-ID]] of the message that this is a reply to. Used to link related messages together. This field only applies for reply messages.\n* ''References'': [[Message-ID]] of the message that this is a reply to, and the message-id of the message the previous reply was a reply to, etc.\n* ''Reply-To'': Address that should be used to reply to the message.\n* ''Sender'': Address of the actual sender acting on behalf of the author listed in the From: field (secretary, list manager, etc.).\n* ''Archived-At'': A direct link to the archived form of an individual email message.\n\nNote that the ''To:'' field is not necessarily related to the addresses to which the message is delivered. The actual delivery list is supplied separately to the transport protocol, [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]], which may or may not originally have been extracted from the header content. The \"To:\" field is similar to the addressing at the top of a conventional letter which is delivered according to the address on the outer envelope. In the same way, the \"From:\" field does not have to be the real sender of the email message. Some mail servers apply [[email authentication]] systems to messages being relayed. Data pertaining to server's activity is also part of the header, as defined below.\n\nSMTP defines the ''trace information'' of a message, which is also saved in the header using the following two fields:<ref>{{cite IETF|title=Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|rfc=5321|author=[[John Klensin]]|sectionname=Trace Information|section=4.4| date=October 2008 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}</ref>\n* ''Received'': when an SMTP server accepts a message it inserts this trace record at the top of the header (last to first).\n* ''Return-Path'': when the delivery SMTP server makes the ''final delivery'' of a message, it inserts this field at the top of the header.\n\nOther fields that are added on top of the header by the receiving server may be called ''trace fields'', in a broader sense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/apps-discuss/current/msg04115.html|title=Trace headers|author=John Levine|date=14 January 2012|work=email message|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]|accessdate=16 January 2012|quote=there are many more trace fields than those two}}</ref>\n* ''Authentication-Results'': when a server carries out authentication checks, it can save the results in this field for consumption by downstream agents.<ref>This extensible field is defined by RFC 7001, that also defines an [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] registry of [http://www.iana.org/assignments/email-auth/ Email Authentication Parameters].</ref>\n* ''Received-SPF'': stores results of [[Sender Policy Framework|SPF]] checks in more detail than Authentication-Results.<ref>RFC 7208.</ref>\n* ''Auto-Submitted'': is used to mark automatically generated messages.<ref>Defined in RFC 3834, and updated by RFC 5436.</ref>\n* ''VBR-Info'': claims [[Vouch by Reference|VBR]] whitelisting<ref>RFC 5518.</ref>\n\n===Message body===\n\n====Content encoding====\nEmail was originally designed for 7-bit [[ASCII]].<ref>{{cite book|title=TCP/IP Network Administration|year=2002|isbn=978-0-596-00297-8|author=Craig Hunt|publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]]|page=70}}</ref> Most email software is [[8-bit clean]] but must assume it will communicate with 7-bit servers and mail readers. The [[MIME]] standard introduced character set specifiers and two content transfer encodings to enable transmission of non-ASCII data: [[quoted printable]] for mostly 7-bit content with a few characters outside that range and [[base64]] for arbitrary binary data. The [[8BITMIME]] and [[BINARY]] extensions were introduced to allow transmission of mail without the need for these encodings, but many [[mail transport agent]]s still do not support them fully. In some countries, several encoding schemes coexist; as the result, by default, the message in a non-Latin alphabet language appears in non-readable form (the only exception is coincidence, when the sender and receiver use the same encoding scheme). Therefore, for international [[character set]]s, [[Unicode]] is growing in popularity.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n====Plain text and HTML====\nMost modern graphic [[email client]]s allow the use of either [[plain text]] or [[HTML#HTML email|HTML]] for the message body at the option of the user. [[HTML email]] messages often include an automatically generated plain text copy as well, for compatibility reasons. Advantages of HTML include the ability to include in-line links and images, set apart previous messages in [[block quote]]s, wrap naturally on any display, use emphasis such as [[underline]]s and [[italics]], and change [[font]] styles. Disadvantages include the increased size of the email, privacy concerns about [[web bug]]s, abuse of HTML email as a vector for [[phishing]] attacks and the spread of [[malware|malicious software]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Email policies that prevent viruses|url=http://advosys.ca/papers/mail-policies.html}}</ref>\n\nSome web-based [[mailing list]]s recommend that all posts be made in plain-text, with 72 or 80 [[characters per line]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://helpdesk.rootsweb.com/listadmins/plaintext.html |title=When posting to a RootsWeb mailing list... |publisher=Helpdesk.rootsweb.com |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.openbsd.org/mail.html |title=...Plain text, 72 characters per line... |publisher=Openbsd.org |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref> for all the above reasons, but also because they have a significant number of readers using [[List of email clients#Text-based|text-based email clients]] such as [[Mutt (email client)|Mutt]].

See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] -->\nMessages are exchanged between hosts using the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] with software programs called [[mail transfer agent]]s (MTAs); and delivered to a mail store by programs called [[mail delivery agent]]s (MDAs, also sometimes called local delivery agents, LDAs). Accepting a message obliges an MTA to deliver it,<ref>In practice, some accepted messages may nowadays not be delivered to the recipient's InBox, but instead to a Spam or Junk folder which, especially in a corporate environment, may be inaccessible to the recipient</ref> and when a message cannot be delivered, that MTA must send a [[bounce message]] back to the sender, indicating the problem.\n\nUsers can retrieve their messages from servers using standard protocols such as [[Post Office Protocol|POP]] or [[IMAP]], or, as is more likely in a large [[corporation|corporate]] environment, with a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] protocol specific to [[Novell Groupwise]], [[Lotus Notes]] or [[Microsoft Exchange Server]]s.  Programs used by users for retrieving, reading, and managing email are called [[mail user agent]]s (MUAs).\n\nMail can be stored on the [[client (computing)|client]], on the [[Server (computing)|server]] side, or in both places. Standard formats for mailboxes include [[Maildir]] and [[mbox]]. Several prominent email clients use their own proprietary format and require conversion software to transfer email between them. Server-side storage is often in a proprietary format but since access is through a standard protocol such as [[IMAP]], moving email from one server to another can be done with any [[Mail user agent|MUA]] supporting the protocol.\n\nMany current email users do not run MTA, MDA or MUA programs themselves, but use a web-based email platform, such as Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo! Mail, that performs the same tasks.<ref>http://dir.yahoo.com/business_and_economy/business_to_business/communications_and_networking/internet_and_world_wide_web/email_providers/free_email/</ref> Such [[webmail]] interfaces allow users to access their mail with any standard [[web browser]], from any computer, rather than relying on an email client.\n\n===Filename extensions===\nUpon reception of email messages, [[email client]] applications save messages in operating system files in the file system. Some clients save individual messages as separate files, while others use various database formats, often proprietary, for collective storage. A historical standard of storage is the ''[[mbox]]'' format. The specific format used is often indicated by special [[filename extension]]s:\n;<tt>eml</tt>\n:Used by many email clients including [[Novell GroupWise]], [[Microsoft Outlook Express]], [[Lotus notes]], [[Windows Mail]], [[Mozilla Thunderbird]], and Postbox. The files are [[plain text]] in [[MIME]] format, containing the email header as well as the message contents and attachments in one or more of several formats.\n;<tt>emlx</tt>\n:Used by [[Apple Mail]].\n;<tt>msg</tt>\n:Used by [[Microsoft Outlook|Microsoft Office Outlook]] and [[OfficeLogic|OfficeLogic Groupware]].\n;<tt>mbx</tt>\n:Used by [[Opera Mail]], [[KMail]], and [[Apple Mail]] based on the [[mbox]] format.\n\nSome applications (like [[Apple Mail]]) leave attachments encoded in messages for searching while also saving separate copies of the attachments. Others separate attachments from messages and save them in a specific directory.\n\n===URI scheme mailto===\n{{main article|mailto}}\nThe [[URI scheme]], as registered with the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]], defines the <tt>mailto:</tt> scheme for SMTP email addresses. Though its use is not strictly defined, URLs of this form are intended to be used to open the new message window of the user's mail client when the URL is activated, with the address as defined by the URL in the ''To:'' field.<ref>RFC 2368 section 3 : by Paul Hoffman in 1998 discusses operation of the \"mailto\" URL.</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Web-based email===\n{{main article|Webmail}}\nMany email providers have a web-based email client (e.g. [[AOL Mail]], [[Gmail]], [[Outlook.com]] and [[Yahoo! Mail]]). This allows users to log in to the email account by using any compatible [[web browser]] to send and receive their email. Mail is typically not downloaded to the client, so can't be read without a current Internet connection.\n\n===POP3 email services===\nThe [[Post Office Protocol]] 3 (POP3) is a mail access protocol used by a client application to read messages from the mail server. Received messages are often deleted from the [[server (computing)|server]]. POP supports simple download-and-delete requirements for access to remote mailboxes (termed maildrop in the POP RFC's).<ref name=\"Windows to Linux\">{{cite book | last = Allen | first = David | title = Windows to Linux | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2004 | location = | page =192 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UD0h_GqgbHgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=network%2B+guide+to+networks&hl=en&src=bmrr&ei=hMnATfmmA8j00gGMsOC2Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CE8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n===IMAP email servers===\nThe [[Internet Message Access Protocol]] (IMAP) provides features to manage a mailbox from multiple devices. Small portable devices like [[smartphone]]s are increasingly used to check email while travelling, and to make brief replies, larger devices with better keyboard access being used to reply at greater length. IMAP shows the headers of messages, the sender and the subject and the device needs to request to download specific messages.

A sponsored 2010 study on workplace communication found 83% of U.S. knowledge workers felt email was critical to their success and productivity at work.<ref name=om>By Om Malik, GigaOm. \"[http://gigaom.com/collaboration/is-email-a-curse-or-a-boon/ Is Email a Curse or a Boon?]\" September 22, 2010. Retrieved October 11, 2010.</ref>\n\nIt has some key benefits to business and other organizations, including:\n; Facilitating logistics\n: Much of the business world relies on communications between people who are not physically in the same building, area, or even country; setting up and attending an in-person meeting, [[telephone call]], or [[conference call]] can be inconvenient, time-consuming, and costly. Email provides a method of exchanging information between two or more people with no set-up costs and that is generally far less expensive than a physical meeting or phone call.\n; Helping with synchronisation\n: With [[Real-time computing|real time]] communication by meetings or phone calls, participants must work on the same schedule, and each participant must spend the same amount of time in the meeting or call. Email allows [[wikt:asynchrony|asynchrony]]: each participant may control their schedule independently.\n; Reducing cost\n: Sending an email is much less expensive than sending postal mail, or [[long distance telephone call]]s, [[telex]] or [[telegrams]].\n; Increasing speed\n: Much faster than most of the alternatives.\n; Creating a \"written\" record\n: Unlike a telephone or in-person conversation, email by its nature creates a detailed written record of the communication, the identity of the sender(s) and recipient(s) and the date and time the message was sent. In the event of a contract or legal dispute, saved emails can be used to prove that an individual was advised of certain issues, as each email has the date and time recorded on it.\n\n====Email marketing====\nEmail marketing via \"[[opt-in email|opt-in]]\" is often successfully used to send special sales offerings and new product information.<ref name=brett>{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = Brett A.

Mobile \"apps\" for email increase accessibility to the medium for users who are out of their home. While in the earliest years of email, users could only access email on desktop computers, in the 2010s, it is possible for users to check their email when they are away from home, whether they are across town or across the world. Alerts can also be sent to the smartphone or other device to notify them immediately of new messages. This has given email the ability to be used for more frequent communication between users and allowed them to check their email and write messages throughout the day. Today, there are an estimated 1.4 billion email users worldwide and 50 billion non-spam emails that are sent daily.\n\nIndividuals often check email on smartphones for both personal and work-related messages. It was found that US adults check their email more than they browse the web or check their [[Facebook]] accounts, making email the most popular activity for users to do on their smartphones. 78% of the respondents in the study revealed that they check their email on their phone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marketingland.com/smartphone-activities-study-email-web-facebook-37954|title=Email Is Top Activity On Smartphones, Ahead Of Web Browsing & Facebook [Study]|date=28 March 2013|publisher=}}</ref> It was also found that 30% of consumers use only their smartphone to check their email, and 91% were likely to check their email at least once per day on their smartphone. However, the percentage of consumers using email on smartphone ranges and differs dramatically across different countries.

Typical attachments include [[Microsoft Word]] documents, [[pdf]] documents and scanned images of paper documents. In principle there is no technical restriction on the size or number of attachments, but in practice email clients, [[server (computing)|server]]s and Internet service providers implement various limitations on the size of files, or complete email - typically to 25MB or less.<ref>[http://exchangepedia.com/2007/09/exchange-server-2007-setting-message-size-limits.html ''\"Setting Message Size Limits in Exchange 2010 and Exchange 2007\"''].</ref><ref>[http://www.geek.com/articles/news/google-updates-file-size-limits-for-gmail-and-youtube-20090629/#ixzz0oIzFY0Q8 ''\"Google updates file size limits for Gmail and YouTube\"'', geek.com].</ref><ref>[http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=8770&topic=1517 ''\"Maximum attachment size\"'', mail.google,com].</ref> Furthermore, due to technical reasons, attachment sizes as seen by these transport systems can differ to what the user sees,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2009.01.exchangeqa.aspx?pr=blog|title=Exchange 2007: Attachment Size Increase,...|date=2010-03-25|publisher=TechNet Magazine, Microsoft.com US}}</ref> which can be confusing to senders when trying to assess whether they can safely send a file by email.

The low cost of sending such email meant that by 2003 up to 30% of total email traffic was already spam.<ref>[http://visionedgemarketing.com/growth-of-spam-email-2/ \"Growth of Spam Email\"]</ref><ref name=\"R\">Rich Kawanagh.

The US [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003]] and similar laws elsewhere<ref>Spam Bill 2003 ([http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2003-04/04bd045.pdf PDF])</ref> had some impact, and a number of effective [[anti-spam techniques (email)|anti-spam techniques]] now largely mitigate the impact of spam by filtering or rejecting it for most users,<ref>[http://www.wired.com/2015/07/google-says-ai-catches-99-9-percent-gmail-spam/ \"Google Says Its AI Catches 99.9 Percent of Gmail Spam\"], Cade Metz, July 09 2015, wired.com</ref> but the volume sent is still very high&mdash;and increasingly consists not of advertisements for products, but malicious content or links.<ref name=\"securelist\">[https://securelist.com/analysis/quarterly-spam-reports/74682/spam-and-phishing-in-q1-2016/ \"Spam and phishing in Q1 2016\"],  May 12, 2016, securelist.com</ref>\n\n===Malware===\nA range of malicious email types exist. These range from [[List of email scams|various types of email scams]], including [[Social engineering (security)|\"social engineering\"]] scams such as [[advance-fee scam]] \"Nigerian letters\", to [[phishing]], [[email bomb]]ardment and [[Computer worm|email worms]].\n\n===Email spoofing===\n{{Main article|Email spoofing}}\n[[Email spoofing]] occurs when the email message header is designed to make the message appear to come from a known or trusted source. [[Email spam]] and [[phishing]] methods typically use spoofing to mislead the recipient about the true message origin. Email spoofing may be done as a prank, or as part of a criminal effort to defraud an individual or organization. An example of a potentially fraudulent email spoofing is if an individual creates an email which appears to be an invoice from a major company, and then sends it to one or more recipients. In some cases, these fraudulent emails incorporate the logo of the purported organization and even the email address may appear legitimate.\n\n===Email bombing===\n{{main article|Email bomb}}\n\n[[Email bomb]]ing is the intentional sending of large volumes of messages to a target address. The overloading of the target email address can render it unusable and can even cause the mail server to crash.\n\n===Privacy concerns===\n{{Main article|Internet privacy}}\n\nToday it can be important to distinguish between Internet and internal email systems. Internet email may travel and be stored on networks and computers without the sender's or the recipient's control. During the transit time it is possible that third parties read or even modify the content. Internal mail systems, in which the information never leaves the organizational network, may be more secure, although [[information technology]] personnel and others whose function may involve monitoring or managing may be accessing the email of other employees.\n\nEmail privacy, without some security precautions, can be compromised because:\n* email messages are generally not encrypted.\n* email messages have to go through intermediate computers before reaching their destination, meaning it is relatively easy for others to intercept and read messages.\n* many Internet Service Providers (ISP) store copies of email messages on their mail servers before they are delivered. The backups of these can remain for up to several months on their server, despite deletion from the mailbox.\n* the \"Received:\"-fields and other information in the email can often identify the sender, preventing anonymous communication.\n\nThere are [[cryptography]] applications that can serve as a remedy to one or more of the above. For example, [[Virtual Private Network]]s or the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor anonymity network]] can be used to encrypt traffic from the user machine to a safer network while [[GNU Privacy Guard|GPG]], [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]], SMEmail,<ref>[http://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1002.3176 SMEmail \u2013 A New Protocol for the Secure E-mail in Mobile Environments], Proceedings of the Australian Telecommunications Networks and Applications Conference (ATNAC'08), pp. 39\u201344, Adelaide, Australia, Dec. 2008.</ref> or [[S/MIME]] can be used for [[end-to-end principle|end-to-end]] message encryption, and SMTP STARTTLS or SMTP over [[Transport Layer Security]]/Secure Sockets Layer can be used to encrypt communications for a single mail hop between the SMTP client and the SMTP server.\n\nAdditionally, many [[mail user agent]]s do not protect logins and passwords, making them easy to intercept by an attacker. Encrypted authentication schemes such as [[Simple Authentication and Security Layer|SASL]] prevent this. Finally, attached files share many of the same hazards as those found in [[Peer-to-peer|peer-to-peer filesharing]]. Attached files may contain [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojans]] or [[Computer virus|viruses]].\n\n===Flaming===\n[[Flaming (Internet)|Flaming]] occurs when a person sends a message (or many messages) with angry or antagonistic content. The term is derived from the use of the word \"incendiary\" to describe particularly heated email discussions. The ease and impersonality of email communications mean that the [[social norms]] that encourage civility in person or via telephone do not exist and civility may be forgotten.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=S. Kiesler |author2=D. Zubrow |author3=A.M. Moses |author4=V. Geller |title=Affect in computer-mediated communication: an experiment in synchronous terminal-to-terminal discussion|journal=Human-Computer Interaction|volume=1|pages=77\u2013104|year=1985|doi=10.1207/s15327051hci0101_3}}</ref>\n\n===Email bankruptcy===\n{{main article|Email bankruptcy}}\nAlso known as \"email fatigue\", email bankruptcy is when a user ignores a large number of email messages after falling behind in reading and answering them. The reason for falling behind is often due to information overload and a general sense there is so much information that it is not possible to read it all. As a solution, people occasionally send a \"boilerplate\" message explaining that their email inbox is full, and that they are in the process of clearing out all the messages. [[Harvard University]] law professor [[Lawrence Lessig]] is credited with coining this term, but he may only have popularized it.<ref>{{cite news|title=All We Are Saying.|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/weekinreview/23buzzwords.html?ref=weekinreview|publisher=The New York Times|date=December 23, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-24|first=Grant|last=Barrett}}</ref>\n\n===Tracking of sent mail===\nThe original SMTP mail service provides limited mechanisms for tracking a transmitted message, and none for verifying that it has been delivered or read. It requires that each mail server must either deliver it onward or return a failure notice (bounce message), but both software bugs and system failures can cause messages to be lost. To remedy this, the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] introduced [[Delivery Status Notification]]s (delivery receipts) and [[Return receipt#Email|Message Disposition Notifications]] (return receipts); however, these are not universally deployed in production. (A complete Message Tracking mechanism was also defined, but it never gained traction; see RFCs 3885<ref>RFC 3885, ''SMTP Service Extension for Message Tracking''</ref> through 3888.<ref>RFC 3888, ''Message Tracking Model and Requirements''</ref>)\n\nMany ISPs now deliberately disable non-delivery reports (NDRs) and delivery receipts due to the activities of spammers:\n* Delivery Reports can be used to verify whether an address exists and if so, this indicates to a spammer that it is available to be spammed.\n* If the spammer uses a forged sender email address ([[email spoofing]]), then the innocent email address that was used can be flooded with NDRs from the many invalid email addresses the spammer may have attempted to mail. These NDRs then constitute spam from the ISP to the innocent user.\n\nIn the absence of standard methods, a range of system based around the use of [[web bug]]s have been developed. However, these are often seen as underhand or raising privacy concerns,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE0D9143AF931A15752C1A9669C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print|title=Software That Tracks E-Mail Is Raising Privacy Concerns|author=Amy Harmon|publisher=The New York Times|date=2000-11-22|accessdate=2012-01-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://email.about.com/od/emailbehindthescenes/a/html_return_rcp.htm |title=About.com |publisher=Email.about.com |date=2013-12-19 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webdevelopersnotes.com/tips/yahoo/notification-when-yahoo-email-is-opened.php |title=Webdevelopersnotes.com |publisher=Webdevelopersnotes.com |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref> and only work with e-mail clients that support rendering of HTML.

Starting in 1977, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) recognized that electronic messaging and electronic transactions posed a significant threat to First Class mail volumes and revenue. The USPS explored an electronic messaging initiative in 1977 and later disbanded it. Twenty years later, in 1997, when email volume overtook postal mail volume, the USPS was again urged to embrace email, and the USPS declined to provide email as a service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1780716/can-technology-save-us-postal-service|title=Can Technology Save The U.S. Postal Service?|work=Fast Company}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V131/N60/emaillab.html|title=Can an MIT professor save the USPS? - The Tech|work=mit.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fedtechmagazine.com/article/2013/01/why-united-states-postal-service-taking-cues-silicon-valley|title=Why the USPS Is Taking Cues from Silicon Valley|work=FedTech}}</ref> The USPS initiated an experimental email service known as [[E-COM]]. E-COM provided a method for the simple exchange of text messages. In 2011, shortly after the USPS reported its state of financial bankruptcy, the USPS Office of Inspector General (OIG) began exploring the possibilities of generating revenue through email servicing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cmsw.mit.edu/usps-can-save-itself/|title=Shiva Ayyadurai: USPS can save itself|work=MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2012/01/13/could-email-save-snail-mail-or-is-the-internet-too-reliant-on-the-usps/|title=Could Email Save Snail Mail, Or Is The Internet Too Reliant on the USPS?|date=6 March 2012|work=BostInno}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/2012/03/02/dear-usps/V4GJ8w9UCcfV4v0WiVjvmK/story.html|title=\u2018Dear USPS . . .\u2019|work=BostonGlobe.com}}</ref> Electronic messages were transmitted to a post office, printed out, and delivered as hard copy. To take advantage of the service, an individual had to transmit at least 200 messages. The delivery time of the messages was the same as First Class mail and cost 26 cents. Both the [[Postal Regulatory Commission]] and the [[Federal Communications Commission]] opposed E-COM. The FCC concluded that E-COM constituted common carriage under its jurisdiction and the USPS would have to file a [[tariff]].<ref>In re Request for declaratory ruling and investigation by Graphnet Systems, Inc., concerning the proposed E-COM service, FCC Docket No. 79-6 (September 4, 1979)</ref> Three years after initiating the service, USPS canceled E-COM and attempted to sell it off.<ref>Hardy, Ian R; [https://archive.org/web/*/http:/www.ifla.org/documents/internet/hari1.txt The Evolution of ARPANET Email]; 1996-05-13; History Thesis Paper; University of California at Berkeley</ref><ref>James Bovard, The Law Dinosaur: The US Postal Service, CATO Policy Analysis (February 1985)</ref><ref name=\"JayAkkad\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~almeroth/classes/F04.176A/homework1_good_papers/jay-akkad.html |title=Jay Akkad, The History of Email |publisher=Cs.ucsb.edu |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/2000/gg00188.pdf |title=US Postal Service: Postal Activities and Laws Related to Electronic Commerce, GAO-00-188 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/ota/Ota_4/DATA/1982/8214.PDF |title=Implications of Electronic Mail and Message Systems for the U.S. Postal Service , Office of Technology Assessment, Congress of the United States, August 1982 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref>\n\nThe early ARPANET dealt with multiple email clients that had various, and at times incompatible, formats. For example, in the [[Multics]], the \"@\" sign meant \"kill line\" and anything before the \"@\" sign was ignored, so Multics users had to use a command-line option to specify the destination system.<ref name=\"thvv\"/> The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] [[DARPA]] desired to have uniformity and interoperability for email and therefore funded efforts to drive towards unified inter-operable standards. This led to David Crocker, John Vittal, Kenneth Pogran, and [[Austin Henderson]] publishing RFC 733, \"Standard for the Format of ARPA Network Text Message\" (November 21, 1977), a subset of which provided a stable base for common use on the ARPANET, but which was not fully effective, and in 1979, a meeting was held at BBN to resolve incompatibility issues. [[Jon Postel]] recounted the meeting in RFC 808, \"Summary of Computer Mail Services Meeting Held at BBN on 10 January 1979\" (March 1, 1982), which includes an appendix listing the varying email systems at the time. This, in turn, led to the release of David Crocker's RFC 822, \"Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Messages\" (August 13, 1982).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livinginternet.com/e/ei.htm |title=Email History, How Email was Invented, Living Internet |publisher=Livinginternet.com |date=1996-05-13 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref> RFC 822 is a small adaptation of RFC 733's details, notably enhancing the [[host (network)|host]] portion, to use [[Domain Name]]s, that were being developed at the same time.\n\nThe [[National Science Foundation]] took over operations of the ARPANET and Internet from the Department of Defense, and initiated [[NSFNet]], a new [[backbone network|backbone]] for the network.

The following year [[Compuserve]] email interconnected with NSFNET. Within a few years the commercial traffic restriction was removed from NSFNETs AUP, and NSFNET was privatised. In the late 1990s, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] grew concerned with fraud transpiring in email, and initiated a series of procedures on spam, fraud, and phishing.<ref>[http://www.cybertelecom.org/spam/Spamref.htm Cybertelecom : SPAM Reference] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140919090804/http://www.cybertelecom.org/spam/Spamref.htm |date=September 19, 2014 }}</ref> In 2004, FTC jurisdiction over spam was codified into law in the form of the [[Can Spam Act|CAN SPAM Act.]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Cannon |url=http://www.cybertelecom.org/spam/canspam.htm |title=Can Spam Act |publisher=Cybertelecom |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref> Several other U.S. federal agencies have also exercised jurisdiction including the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]].
