It expresses levels of light intensity in terms of the light emitted by a [[candle]] of specific size and constituents. In modern usage ''candlepower'' equates directly to the unit known as the [[candela]].\n\n==History==\nThe use of candle term candlepower was originally defined in England by the [[Metropolitan Gas Act 1860]] as the light produced by a pure [[spermaceti]] candle weighing {{convert|1/6|lb|g|sigfig=2|abbr=off}} and burning at a rate of {{convert|120|gr/h|g/h|abbr=off}}. Spermaceti is found in the heads of [[sperm whale]]s, and was once used to make high-quality candles.\n\nAt this time the French standard of light was based upon the illumination from a [[Carcel burner]]. The unit was defined as that illumination emanating from a lamp burning pure [[colza oil]] (obtained from the seed of the plant ''[[Brassica rapa|Brassica campestris]]'') at a defined rate. It was accepted that ten standard candles were about equal to one Carcel burner.\n\nIn 1909 a meeting took place to come up with an international standard. It was attended by representatives of the ''[[Laboratoire Central de l\u2019Electricit\u00e9]]'' (France), the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] (UK), the [[Bureau of Standards]] (United States) and the ''[[Physikalische Technische Reichsanstalt]]'' (Germany). The majority redefined the candle in term of an electric lamp with a carbon filament. The Germans, however, dissented and decided to use a definition equal to 9/10 of the output of a [[Hefner lamp]].\n\nIn 1921, the ''Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage'' (International Commission for Illumination, commonly referred to as the CIE) redefined the international candle again in terms of a carbon filament [[incandescent lamp]].\n\nIn 1937, the international candle was redefined again against the luminous intensity of a [[blackbody]] at the freezing point of liquid [[platinum]] which was to be 58.9 international candles per square centimetre.\n\nIn 1948 the term candlepower was replaced by the international unit ([[SI]]) known as the [[candela]]. One old ''candlepower'' unit is about 0.981 candela. In general modern use, a ''candlepower'' now equates directly (1:1) to the number of candelas<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/candlepower|title=Candlepower - Definition |work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref>\u2014an implicit increase from its old value.\n\n==Calibration of lamps==\nThe candlepower of a lamp was measured by judging by eye the relative brightness of adjacent surfaces, one illuminated only by a standard lamp (or candle) and the other only by the lamp under test. The distance of one of the lamps was adjusted until the two were judged to give equal brightness. The candlepower of the lamp under test could then be calculated from the two distances and the [[inverse square law]].\n\n==Modern use==\n\"Candlepower\" is largely an obsolete term. However, it is still sometimes used to describe the luminous intensity of high powered flashlights and spotlights. Narrow-beamed lights of all sorts can have very high candlepower specifications, because candlepower measures the intensity of the light falling on a target, rather than the total amount of light emitted. A given lamp will have a higher candlepower rating if its light is more tightly focussed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peakbeam.com/faqs/|title=Frequently Asked Questions|author=Peak Beam Systems, Inc.|work=peakbeam.com|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nOnly a few artificial light sources, such as military [[photoflash bomb]]s, have the very high candlepower ratings characteristic of narrow-beamed spotlights but, simultaneously, a wide unfocused distribution of light.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of obsolete units of measurement]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictC.html |title=How Many?
