An example of qualitative data would be an [[anthropologist]]'s handwritten notes about her interviews with people of an Indigenous tribe. Pieces of data are individual pieces of [[information]]. While the concept of data is commonly associated with [[scientific research]], data is collected by a huge range of organizations and institutions, including businesses (e.g., sales data, revenue, profits, [[stock price]]), governments (e.g., [[crime rate]]s, [[unemployment rate]]s, [[literacy]] rates) and non-governmental organizations (e.g., censuses of the number of [[homelessness|homeless people]] by non-profit organizations).\n\nData is [[measurement|measured]], [[data reporting|collected and reported]], and [[data analysis|analyzed]], whereupon it can be [[data visualization|visualized]] using graphs, images or other analysis tools. Data as a general [[concept]] refers to the fact that some existing [[information]] or [[knowledge]] is ''[[Knowledge representation and reasoning|represented]]'' or ''[[code]]d'' in some form suitable for better usage or [[data processing|processing]]. ''[[Raw data]]'' (\"unprocessed data\") is a collection of [[number]]s or [[character (computing)|characters]] before it has been \"cleaned\" and corrected by researchers. Raw data needs to be corrected to remove [[outlier]]s or obvious instrument or data entry errors (e.g., a thermometer reading from an outdoor Arctic location recording a tropical temperature).  Data processing commonly occurs by stages, and the \"processed data\" from one stage may be considered the \"raw data\" of the next stage. [[Field work|Field data]] is raw data that is collected in an uncontrolled \"[[in situ]]\" environment. [[Experimental data]] is data that is generated within the context of a scientific investigation by observation and recording.\n== Etymology and terminology ==\nThe first English use of the word \"data\" is from the 1640s. Using the word \"data\" to mean \"transmittable and storable computer information\" was first done in 1946. The expression \"data processing\" was first used in 1954.<ref name=\"eol\">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=data</ref>\n\nThe [[Data (word)|Latin word ''data'']] is the plural of ''datum'', \"(thing) given,\" neuter past participle of ''dare'' \"to give\".<ref name=\"eol\"/>  Data may be used as a plural noun in this sense, with some writers in the 2010s using ''datum'' in the singular and ''data'' for plural. In the 2010s, though, in non-specialist, everyday writing, \"data\" is most commonly used in the singular, as a [[mass noun]] (like \"information\", \"sand\" or \"rain\").<ref>{{cite web|last=Hickey |first=Walt |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/elitist-superfluous-or-popular-we-polled-americans-on-the-oxford-comma/ |title=Elitist, Superfluous, Or Popular?

Data is collected and analyzed; data only becomes information suitable for making decisions once it has been analyzed in some fashion. <ref>{{cite web|title=Joint Publication 2-0, Joint Intelligence|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp2_0.pdf|work=Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC)|publisher=Department of Defense|accessdate=February 22, 2013|pages=GL-11|date=22 June 2007}}</ref> [[Knowledge]] is derived from extensive amounts of experience dealing with information on a subject. For example, the height of [[Mt. Everest]] is generally considered data. The height can be recorded precisely with an [[altimeter]] and entered into a database. This data may be included in a book along with other data on Mt. Everest to describe the mountain in a manner useful for those who wish to make a decision about the best method to climb it. Using an understanding based on experience climbing mountains to advise persons on the way to reach Mt. Everest's peak may be seen as \"knowledge\". Some complement the series \"data\", \"information\" and \"knowledge\" with \"wisdom\", which would mean the status of a person in possession of a certain \"knowledge\" who also knows under which circumstances is good to use it.\n\nThat is to say, data is the least abstract, information the next least, and knowledge the most abstract.<ref>{{cite web\n |author=Akash Mitra\n |year=2011\n |title=Classifying data for successful modeling\n |url=http://www.dwbiconcepts.com/data-warehousing/12-data-modelling/101-classifying-data-for-successful-modeling.html\n}}</ref>  Data becomes information by interpretation; e.g., the height of [[Mt. Everest]] is generally considered \"data\", a book on Mt. Everest geological characteristics may be considered \"information\", and a climber's guidebook containing practical information on the best way to reach Mt. Everest's peak may be considered \"knowledge\". \"Information\" bears a diversity of meanings that ranges from everyday usage to technical use. Generally speaking, the concept of information is closely related to notions of constraint, communication, control, data, form, instruction, knowledge, meaning, mental stimulus, pattern, perception, and representation.<!--given by nupur seth--> Beynon-Davies uses the concept of a [[sign]] to differentiate between data and information; data is a series of symbols, while information occurs when the symbols are used to refer to something.<ref>{{cite book\n |author=P.

Since the development of computing devices and machines, these devices can also collect data. In the 2010s, computers are widely used in many fields to collect data and sort or process it, in disciplines ranging from [[marketing]], analysis of [[social services]] usage by citizens to scientific research. These patterns in data are seen as information which can be used to enhance knowledge. These patterns may be interpreted as \"[[truth]]\" (though \"truth\" can be a subjective concept), and may be authorized as aesthetic and ethical criteria in some disciplines or cultures. Events that leave behind perceivable physical or virtual remains can be traced back through data. Marks are no longer considered data once the link between the mark and observation is broken.<ref>{{cite book\n |author=Sharon Daniel\n |title=The Database: An Aesthetics of Dignity\n}}</ref>\n\nMechanical computing devices are classified according to the means by which they represent data. An [[analog computer]] represents a datum as a voltage, distance, position, or other physical quantity. A [[Computer|digital computer]] represents a piece of data as a sequence of symbols drawn from a fixed [[alphabet]]. The most common digital computers use a binary alphabet, that is, an alphabet of two characters, typically denoted \"0\" and \"1\". More familiar representations, such as numbers or letters, are then constructed from the binary alphabet. Some special forms of data are distinguished. A [[computer program]] is a collection of data, which can be interpreted as instructions. Most computer languages make a distinction between programs and the other data on which programs operate, but in some languages, notably [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] and similar languages, programs are essentially indistinguishable from other data. It is also useful to distinguish [[metadata]], that is, a description of other data. A similar yet earlier term for metadata is \"ancillary data.\"  The prototypical example of metadata is the library catalog, which is a description of the contents of books.\n\n== In other fields ==\nThough data is also increasingly used in other fields, it has been suggested that the highly interpretive nature of them might be at odds with the ethos of data as \"given\". Peter Checkland introduced the term ''capta'' (from the Latin ''capered'', \u201cto take\u201d) to distinguish between an immense number of possible data and a sub-set of them, to which attention is oriented.<ref>{{cite book | author = P.
