In a bus network, every station receives all network traffic, and the traffic generated by each station has equal transmission priority.<ref>{{cite book | first1=Geoffrey | last1=Knott | first2=Nick | last2=Waites| title = BTEC Nationals for IT Practitioners | publisher = Brancepeth Computer Publications| year = 2002| isbn = 0-9538848-2-1 | quote = ...all stations have equal priority in using the network to transmit.| pages = 395 }}</ref> A bus network forms a single [[network segment]] and [[collision domain]]. In order for nodes to transmit on the same bus simultaneously, they use a [[media access control]] technology such as [[carrier sense multiple access]] (CSMA) or a [[bus master]].\n\nIf any link or segment of the bus is severed, all network transmission ceases due to signal bounce caused by the lack of a terminating [[resistor]].\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages==                                             \n===Advantages===\n*very Easy to connect a computer or peripheral to a linear bus\n*Requires less cable length than a star topology resulting in lower costs\n*It works well for small networks.\n\n===Disadvantages===\n*Entire network shuts down if there is a break in the main cable or one of the T connectors break.\n*Large amount of packet collisions on the network, which results in high amounts of packet loss.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Network Topologies]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Network topologies}}\n\n[[Category:Network architecture]]\n[[Category:Network topology]]\n\n\n{{Compu-network-stub}}"}]}}}}
