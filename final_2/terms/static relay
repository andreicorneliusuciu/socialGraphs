Both types of relay control electrical circuits through a switch that is open or closed depending upon an electrical input. \n\nStatic relays have been designed to perform similar functions with the use of electronic circuit control as an electromechanical relay performs with the use of moving parts or elements.<ref name=\"BHEL\" /> For example, in an induction type electromechanical relay, the time delay for the switching action can be adjusted by adjusting the distance traveled by the disc, whereas in a static relay the delay can be set by adjusting the value of the resistance in an R-C time delay circuit.\n\nStatic relays may be based on analog solid state circuits, digital logic circuits, or microprocessor-based designs.<ref name=\"BHEL\" /> Some authors use the term \"static relay\" to refer only to [[solid state relay]]s.<ref name=\"NPAG\">{{cite book|last1=Alstom|title=Network Protection And Automation Guide|date=2011|chapter=Chapter 7|url=http://electrical-engineering-portal.com/download-center/books-and-guides/electrical-engineering/automation-guide}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n\nA static relay consists of:<ref name=\"BHEL\" />\n* An input circuit that measures the value of desired property\n* A [[comparator]] circuit that compares the measured value to a preset threshold\n* An optional time delay circuit that controls the timing of the switch action after the input has reached the threshold\n* A power supply for the static relay circuits\n\nFor example, an overcurrent protective relay may have a [[AC to DC power supply]] for the input circuit, a level detector circuit and an RC time delay circuit.<ref name=\"BHEL\" /> While early comparators used discrete [[transistor ]]circuits, modern designs use [[operational amplifier]]s.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Solid state switches]]\n\n\n{{electric-stub}}"}]}}}}
