When aircraft first began to be able to reach close to supersonic speed, these effects were seen as constituting a barrier making supersonic speed very difficult or impossible.<ref>encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/sonic+barrier</ref><ref>http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/sound-barrier</ref>\n\nIn dry air at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F), the sound barrier is reached when an object moves at a speed of 343 metres per second (about 767&nbsp;mph, 1234&nbsp;km/h or 1,125&nbsp;ft/s). The term came into use in this sense during [[World War II]], when a number of [[aircraft]] started to encounter the effects of [[compressibility]], a number of unrelated aerodynamic effects that \"struck\" their aircraft, seemingly impeding further acceleration. By the 1950s, new aircraft designs routinely \"broke\" the sound barrier.{{#tag:ref|See \"[[Speed of sound]]\" for the science behind the velocity called the ''sound barrier'', and to \"[[Sonic boom]]\" for information on the sound associated with supersonic flight.|group=N}}\n\n==History==\nSome common whips such as the [[bullwhip]] or [[stockwhip]] are able to move faster than sound: the tip of the whip breaks the sound barrier and causes a sharp crack\u2014literally a [[sonic boom]].<ref>May, Mike.

This finding is theoretical and disputed by others in the field.<ref name='dino'>Wilford, John Noble.

Retrieved: January 15, 2009.</ref>\nMeteorites entering the Earth's atmosphere usually, if not always, descend faster than sound.\n\n===Early problems===\nThe tip of the [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] on many early aircraft may reach supersonic speeds, producing a noticeable buzz that differentiates such aircraft. This is particularly noticeable on the [[Boeing-Stearman Model 75|Stearman]], and noticeable on the [[North American T-6 Texan]] when it enters a sharp-breaking turn. This is undesirable, as the transonic air movement creates disruptive shock waves and turbulence. It is due to these effects that propellers are known to suffer from dramatically decreased performance as they approach the [[speed of sound]]. It is easy to demonstrate that the power needed to improve performance is so great that the weight of the required engine grows faster than the power output of the propeller can compensate. This problem was one that led to early research into [[jet engine]]s, notably by [[Frank Whittle]] in England and [[Hans von Ohain]] in Germany, who were led to their research specifically in order to avoid these problems in high-speed flight.\n\nNevertheless, propeller aircraft ''were'' able to approach the speed of sound in a dive. Unfortunately, doing so led to numerous crashes for a variety of reasons. Most infamously, in the [[Mitsubishi Zero]], pilots flew [[Controlled flight into terrain|full power into the terrain]] because the rapidly increasing forces acting on the control surfaces of their aircraft overpowered them.<ref>Yoshimura 1996, p. 108.</ref> In this case, several attempts to fix it only made the problem worse. Likewise, the flexing caused by the low torsional stiffness of the [[Supermarine Spitfire]]'s wings caused them, in turn, to counteract aileron control inputs, leading to a condition known as ''[[control reversal]]''. This was solved in later models with changes to the wing. Worse still, a particularly dangerous interaction of the airflow between the wings and tail surfaces of diving [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]]s made \"pulling out\" of dives difficult; however, the problem was later solved by the addition of a \"dive flap\" that upset the airflow under these circumstances. [[Aeroelasticity#Flutter|Flutter]] due to the formation of [[shock wave]]s on curved surfaces was another major problem, which led most famously to the breakup of [[de Havilland Swallow]] and death of its pilot, [[Geoffrey de Havilland, Jr.]] in 1946. A similar problem is thought to be the cause of the 1943 crash of the [[BI-1]] rocket aircraft in the Soviet Union.\n\nAll of these effects, although unrelated in most ways, led to the concept of a \"barrier\" that makes it difficult for an aircraft to exceed the speed of sound.{{#tag:ref|Quote: \"For various reasons it is fairly certain that the maximum attainable speed under self-propelled conditions will be that of sound in air,\" i.e., {{convert|750|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>Portway 1940, p. 18.</ref>|group=N}}\n\n===Early claims===\nDuring WWII and immediately thereafter a number of claims were made that the sound barrier had been broken in a dive. However, the majority of these purported events can be dismissed as instrumentation errors. The typical [[airspeed indicator]] (ASI) uses air pressure differences between two or more points on the aircraft, typically near the nose and at the side of the fuselage, to produce a speed figure. At high speed the various compression effects that lead to the sound barrier also cause the ASI to go non-linear, and produce inaccurately high or low readings, depending on the specifics of the installation. This effect became known as \"Mach jump\".<ref>Jordan, Corey C.

Many claims of supersonic speeds were found to be far below this speed when measured in this fashion.\n\nIn 1942, [[Republic Aviation]] issued a press release stating that Lts. [[Harold E. Comstock]] and Roger Dyar had exceeded the speed of sound during test dives in the [[P-47]] ''Thunderbolt''. It is widely agreed that this was due to inaccurate ASI readings. In similar tests, the [[North American P-51 Mustang]], a higher performance aircraft, demonstrated limits at Mach 0.85, with every flight over M0.84 causing the aircraft to be damaged by vibration.<ref>{{cite techreport |title= Compressibility Dive Tests on the North American P-51D Airplane, (\u2018Mustang IV\u2019) AAF No.44-14134 |publisher=Wright Field |date=9 October 1944}}</ref>\n\n[[File:spitfire mk11 pl965 arp.jpg|thumb|right|A Spitfire PR Mk XI (''[[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|PL965]]'') of the type used in the 1944 RAE Farnborough dive tests during which a highest Mach Number of 0.92 was obtained]]\n\nOne of the highest recorded instrumented Mach Numbers attained for a propeller aircraft is the Mach 0.891 for a [[Supermarine Spitfire#Speed and altitude records|Spitfire PR XI]], flown during dive tests at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough]] in April 1944.

He also reported engine flame out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mach1.luftarchiv.de/first_flg.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050206120808/http://mach1.luftarchiv.de/first_flg.htm|title=The Unknown Pilot|archivedate=6 February 2005|first=Hans Guido |last=Mutke}}</ref>\n\nThis claim is widely disputed, even by pilots in his unit.<ref name=firstbroke>{{cite news |url=http://www.news24.com/xArchive/Archive/Nazi-era-pilot-says-he-broke-sound-barrier-first-20010612 |title= Nazi-era pilot says he broke sound barrier first |website=news24 |date=12 August 2001}}</ref> All of the effects he reported are known to occur on the Me 262 at much lower speeds, and the ASI reading is simply not reliable in the transonic. Further, a series of tests made by Karl Doetsch at the behest of Willy Messerschmitt found that the plane became uncontrollable above Mach 0.86, and at Mach 0.9 would nose over into a dive that could not be recovered from. Post-war tests by the RAF confirmed these results, with the slight modification that the maximum speed using new instruments was found to be Mach 0.84, rather than Mach 0.86.<ref>[http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/history/q0198c.shtml \"Me 262 and the Sound Barrier.\"] ''aerospaceweb.org.''

It is also reported that once the speed of sound is exceeded, this condition disappears and normal control is restored.}}\nThe comments about restoration of flight control and cessation of buffeting above Mach 1 are very significant in a 1946 document.

Dittmar himself does not make a claim that he broke the sound barrier on that flight, and notes that the speed was recorded only on the AIS. He does, however, take credit for being the first pilot to \"knock on the sound barrier.\"<ref name=firstbroke/>\n\nThe Luftwaffe test pilot [[Lothar Sieber]] (April 7, 1922 - March 1, 1945) may have inadvertently become the first man to break the sound barrier on 1 March 1945.

In 1933, Soviet designers working on [[ramjet]] concepts fired phosphorus-powered engines out of artillery guns to get them to operational speeds. It is possible that this produced supersonic performance as high as Mach 2,<ref>Durant, Frederick C. and George S. James. \"Early Experiments with Ramjet Engines in Flight.\" ''First Steps Toward Space: Proceedings of the First and Second History Symposia of the International Academy of Astronautics at Belgrade, Yugoslavia, September 26, 1967.''

In contrast, the German [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] [[ballistic missile]] routinely broke the sound barrier in flight, for the first time on 3 October 1942. By September 1944, V-2s routinely achieved Mach 4 (1,200&nbsp;m/s, or 3044&nbsp;mph) during terminal descent.\n\n===Breaking the sound barrier===\n[[File:MilesM52 1.jpg|thumb|right|The prototype [[Miles M.52]] turbojet powered aircraft, designed to achieve supersonic level flight.]]\nIn 1942, the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Ministry of Aviation]] began a top-secret project with [[Miles Aircraft]] to develop the world's first aircraft capable of breaking the sound barrier. The project resulted in the development of the prototype [[Miles M.52]] turbojet powered aircraft, which was designed to reach 1,000&nbsp;mph (417&nbsp;m/s; 1,600&nbsp;km/h) (over twice the existing speed record) in level flight, and to climb to an altitude of 36,000&nbsp;ft (11&nbsp;km) in 1 minute 30 sec.\n\nA huge number of advanced features were incorporated into the resulting M.52 design, many of which hint at a detailed knowledge of [[supersonic]] [[aerodynamics]]. In particular, the design featured a conical nose and sharp wing leading edges, as it was known that round-nosed projectiles could not be stabilised at supersonic speeds.  The design used very thin wings of biconvex section proposed by [[Jakob Ackeret]] for [[wave drag|low drag]]. The wing tips were \"clipped\" to keep them clear of the [[Cone (geometry)|conical]] [[shock wave]] generated by the nose of the aircraft. The fuselage had the minimum cross-section allowable around the centrifugal engine with fuel tanks in a saddle over the top.\n\n[[Image:M52 model.jpg|thumb|left|One of the Vickers models undergoing supersonic wind-tunnel testing at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) c.1946]]\nAnother critical addition was the use of a power-operated [[stabilator]], also known as the all-moving tail or [[flying tail]], a key to supersonic flight control which contrasted with traditional hinged [[tailplane]]s (horizontal stabilizers) connected mechanically to the pilots [[control column]]. Conventional control surfaces became ineffective at the high subsonic speeds then being achieved by fighters in dives, due to the aerodynamic forces caused by the formation of shockwaves at the hinge and the rearward movement of the [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|centre of pressure]], which together could override the control forces that could be applied mechanically by the pilot, hindering recovery from the dive.<ref name=\"Brown 1970\">Brown 1970.</ref><ref>[[Roland Beamont|Beamont, Roland]]. ''Testing Early Jets.'' London: Airlife, 1990. ISBN 1-85310-158-3.</ref> A major impediment to early transonic flight was [[control reversal]], the phenomenon which caused flight inputs (stick, rudder) to switch direction at high speed; it was the cause of many accidents and near-accidents. An ''all-flying tail'' is considered to be a minimum condition of enabling aircraft to break the transonic barrier safely, without losing pilot control. The Miles M.52 was the first instance of this solution, and has since been universally applied.\n\nInitially, the aircraft was to use [[Frank Whittle]]'s latest engine, the [[Power Jets W.2#Variants|Power Jets W.2/700]], which would only reach supersonic speed in a shallow dive. To develop a fully supersonic version of the aircraft a new innovation was incorporated; a ''reheat jetpipe'' - also known as an [[Afterburner (engine)|afterburner]]. Extra fuel was to be burned in the tailpipe to avoid overheating the turbine blades, making use of unused oxygen in the exhaust.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1946/1946%20-%201965.html \"Miles on Supersonic Flight\"] ''Flight'' 3 October 1946 p355</ref> Finally, the design included another critical element, the use of a [[Inlet cone|shock cone]] in the nose to slow the incoming air to the subsonic speeds needed by the engine.\n\nAlthough the project was eventually cancelled, the research was used to construct an unmanned missile that went on to achieve a speed of [[Mach number|Mach]] 1.38 in a successful, controlled [[transonic]] and [[supersonic]] level test flight; a unique achievement at that time which validated the aerodynamics of the M.52.\n\n===Sound barrier officially broken in aircraft===\nThe British [[Air Ministry]] signed an agreement with the [[United States]] to exchange all its high-speed research, data and designs and [[Bell Aircraft]] company was given access to the drawings and research on the M.52,<ref>Wood 1975, p. 36.</ref> but the U.S. reneged on the agreement and no data was forthcoming in return.<ref>Bancroft, Dennis.

It was in the X-1 that [[Chuck Yeager]] was credited with being the first person to break the sound barrier in level flight on October 14, 1947, flying at an altitude of 45,000&nbsp;ft (13.7&nbsp;km). [[George Welch (pilot)|George Welch]] made a plausible but officially unverified claim to have broken the sound barrier on 1 October 1947, while flying an XP-86 [[North American F-86 Sabre|Sabre]]. He also claimed to have repeated his supersonic flight on October 14, 1947, 30 minutes before Yeager broke the sound barrier in the Bell X-1. Although evidence from witnesses and instruments strongly imply that Welch achieved supersonic speed, the flights were not properly monitored and are not officially recognized. The XP-86 officially achieved supersonic speed on April 26, 1948.<ref>Wagner 1963, p. 17.</ref>\n\nOn 14 October 1947, just under a month after the United States Air Force had been created as a separate service, the tests culminated in the first manned supersonic flight, piloted by Air Force Captain [[Chuck Yeager|Charles \"Chuck\" Yeager]] in aircraft #46-062, which he had christened ''Glamorous Glennis''. The rocket-powered aircraft was launched from the bomb bay of a specially modified B-29 and glided to a landing on a runway. XS-1 flight number 50 is the first one where the X-1 recorded supersonic flight, at Mach 1.06 (361&nbsp;m/s, 1,299&nbsp;km/h, 807.2&nbsp;mph) peak speed; however, Yeager and many other personnel believe Flight #49 (also with Yeager piloting), which reached a top recorded speed of Mach 0.997 (339&nbsp;m/s, 1,221&nbsp;km/h), may have, in fact, exceeded Mach 1.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} (The measurements were not accurate to three significant figures and no sonic boom was recorded for that flight.)\n\nAs a result of the X-1's initial supersonic flight, the National Aeronautics Association voted its 1948 Collier Trophy to be shared by the three main participants in the program. Honored at the White House by President Harry S. Truman were Larry Bell for Bell Aircraft, Captain Yeager for piloting the flights, and John Stack for the NACA contributions.\n\n[[Jacqueline Cochran|Jackie Cochran]] was the first woman to break the sound barrier on May 18, 1953, in a [[Canadair Sabre]], with Yeager as her [[wingman]].\n\n===The sound barrier understood===\n[[Image:Yeager supersonic flight 1947.ogg|thumb|[[Chuck Yeager]] broke the sound barrier on October 14, 1947 in the [[Bell X-1]], as shown in this newsreel.]]\n\nAs the science of high-speed flight became more widely understood, a number of changes led to the eventual understanding that the \"sound barrier\" is easily penetrated. Among these were the introduction of [[swept wing]]s, the [[area rule]], and engines of ever-increasing performance. By the 1950s many combat aircraft could routinely break the sound barrier in level flight, although they often suffered from control problems when doing so, such as [[Mach tuck]]. Modern aircraft can transit the \"barrier\" without control problems.<ref>[http://www.diracdelta.co.uk/science/source/s/o/sound barrier/source.html \"Sound Barrier.\"]  ''DiracDelta.co.uk: Science and Engineering Encyclopedia.''

History has proven this yet to be the case. Although the [[Concorde]] and the [[Tupolev Tu-144]] entered service in the 1970s, both have since been retired.
