Rockets are now used for [[fireworks]], [[weapon]]ry, [[ejection seat]]s, [[launch vehicle]]s for [[artificial satellite]]s, [[human spaceflight]], and [[space exploration]].\n\n[[Chemical rocket]]s are the most common type of high power rocket, typically creating a high speed exhaust by the [[combustion]] of [[rocket propellant|fuel]] with an [[oxidizer]]. The stored propellant can be a simple pressurized gas or a single [[liquid fuel]] that disassociates in the presence of a catalyst ([[monopropellant]]s), two liquids that spontaneously react on contact ([[hypergolic propellant]]s), two liquids that must be ignited to react, a solid combination of fuel with oxidizer ([[Solid-fuel rocket|solid fuel]]), or solid fuel with liquid oxidizer ([[Hybrid rocket|hybrid propellant system]]). Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form, and can be very dangerous.

The first mathematical treatment of the dynamics of rocket propulsion is due to [[William Moore (British mathematician)|William Moore]] (1813).\nIn 1815, [[Alexander Dmitrievich Zasyadko]]  constructed rocket-launching platforms, which allowed rockets to be fired in [[salvo]]s (6 rockets at a time), and gun-laying devices. \n[[William Hale (British inventor)|William Hale]] in 1844 greatly increased the accuracy  of rocket artillery. The  Congreve rocket  was further improved by  [[Edward Mounier Boxer]]  in 1865.\n\n[[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] (1903) first speculated on the possibility of [[manned spaceflight]] with rocket technology.\n[[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]] in 1920 published proposed improvements to rocket technology in ''[[A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes]]''.  In 1923, [[Hermann Oberth]] (1894\u20131989) published ''Die Rakete zu den Planetenr\u00e4umen'' (\"The Rocket into Planetary Space\")\n\n[[File:Goddard and Rocket.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Goddard with a liquid oxygen-gasoline rocket (1926)]]\n\nModern rockets originated when Goddard attached a [[supersonic]] ([[de Laval nozzle|de Laval]]) nozzle to the [[combustion chamber]] of a [[liquid-fueled rocket engine]]. These nozzles turn the hot gas from the combustion chamber into a cooler, [[hypersonic]], highly directed jet of gas, more than doubling the thrust and raising the engine efficiency from 2% to 64%.\nUse of [[liquid propellant]]s instead of [[gunpowder]] greatly improved the effectiveness of rocket artillery in World War II, and opened up the possibility of  [[manned spaceflight]] after 1945.\n\nIn 1943, production of the [[V-2 rocket]] began in Germany. \nIn parallel with the [[guided missile]] programme,  rockets were also used on [[aircraft]], either for assisting horizontal take-off ([[JATO|RATO]]), vertical take-off ([[Bachem Ba 349]] \"Natter\") or for powering them ([[Me 163]], see [[list of World War II guided missiles of Germany]]). The Allies' rocket programs were  less sophisticated, relying mostly on unguided missiles like the Soviet [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha rocket]].\nThe Americans captured a large number of German [[rocket scientist]]s, including von [[Wernher von Braun]], and brought them to the United States as part of [[Operation Paperclip]]. After the war, rockets were used to study high-altitude conditions, by radio [[telemetry]] of temperature and pressure of the atmosphere, detection of [[cosmic rays]], and further research; notably the [[Bell X-1]], the first manned vehicle to break the [[sound barrier]]. Independently, in the [[Soviet space program|Soviet Union's space program]] research continued under the leadership of the chief designer [[Sergei Korolev]].\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]], rockets became extremely important militarily as modern [[intercontinental ballistic missiles]] (ICBMs).\nThe 1960s became the decade of rapid development of rocket technology particularly in the Soviet Union ([[Vostok rocket|Vostok]], [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz]], [[Proton rocket|Proton]]) and in the United States (e.g. the [[X-15]]). Rockets were now used for [[space exploration]], with the American manned programs  [[Project Mercury]], [[Project Gemini]] and later the [[Apollo programme]] culminated in 1969 with the first manned [[moon landing|landing on the moon]] via the [[Saturn V]].\n\n==Types==\n;Vehicle configurations\n[[File:Ap4-s67-50531.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Saturn V]] is the biggest rocket to have successfully flown.]]\nRocket vehicles are often constructed in the archetypal tall thin \"rocket\" shape that takes off vertically, but there are actually many different types of rockets including:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/conghand/vehicles.htm |title=NASA History: Rocket vehicles |publisher=Hq.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://strangevehicles.greyfalcon.us/OPEL%20ROCKET%20VEHICLES.htm |title=OPEL Rocket vehicles |publisher=Strangevehicles.greyfalcon.us |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref>\n*tiny models such as [[balloon rocket]]s, [[water rocket]]s, [[skyrocket]]s or [[model rocket|small solid rockets]] that can be purchased at a [[hobby store]]\n*[[missile]]s\n*[[launch vehicle|space rocket]]s such as the enormous [[Saturn V]] used for the [[Apollo program]]\n*[[rocket car]]s\n*rocket bike<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30007505|title=Rocket bicycle sets 207mph speed record By Leo Kelion|publisher=BBC News|date= 2013-11-11|accessdate=2014-11-11}}</ref>\n*[[rocket-powered aircraft]] (including rocket assisted takeoff of conventional aircraft- [[JATO|RATO]])\n*[[rocket sled]]s\n*[[Opel-RAK|rocket train]]s\n*[[VA-111 Shkval|rocket torpedoes]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Polmar|first1=Norman|last2=Moore|first2=Kenneth J.|title=Cold War submarines : the design and construction of U.S. and Soviet submarines|date=2004|publisher=Brassey's|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-57488-594-1|page=304}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=III|first1=compiled by A.D.

Most current rockets are chemically powered rockets (usually [[internal combustion engines]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Charles Lafayette Proctor II |url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9368065/internal-combustion-engine |title=internal combustion engines |publisher=Concise Britannica |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref> but some employ a decomposing [[monopropellant]]) that emit a hot [[exhaust gas]]. A rocket engine can use gas propellants, [[Solid-fuel rocket|solid propellant]], [[liquid rocket|liquid propellant]], or a [[hybrid rocket|hybrid mixture of both solid and liquid]]. Some rockets use heat or pressure that is supplied from a source other than the [[chemical reaction]] of propellant(s), such as [[steam rocket]]s, [[solar thermal rocket]]s, [[nuclear thermal rocket]] engines or simple pressurized rockets such as [[water rocket]] or [[cold gas thruster]]s. With combustive propellants a chemical reaction is initiated between the [[fuel]] and the [[oxidizer]] in the [[combustion]] chamber, and the resultant hot gases accelerate out of a [[rocket engine nozzle]] (or [[nozzle]]s) at the rearward-facing end of the rocket. The [[acceleration]] of these gases through the engine exerts force (\"thrust\") on the combustion chamber and nozzle, propelling the vehicle (according to [[Newton's Third Law]]). This actually happens because the force (pressure times area) on the combustion chamber wall is unbalanced by the nozzle opening; this is not the case in any other direction. The shape of the nozzle also generates force by directing the exhaust gas along the axis of the rocket.<ref name=\"RPE7\"/>\n\n===Propellant===\n{{Main article|Rocket propellant}}\n[[File:Gas Core light bulb.png|thumb|Gas Core light bulb]]\nRocket propellant is mass that is stored, usually in some form of [[propellant]] tank or casing, prior to being used as the propulsive mass that is ejected from a [[rocket engine]] in the form of a [[fluid]] [[jet (fluid)|jet]] to produce [[thrust]].<ref name=\"RPE7\"/> For chemical rockets often the propellants are a fuel such as [[liquid hydrogen]] or [[kerosene]] burned with an oxidizer such as [[liquid oxygen]] or [[nitric acid]] to produce large volumes of very hot gas. The oxidiser is either kept separate and mixed in the combustion chamber, or comes premixed, as with solid rockets.\n\nSometimes the propellant is not burned but still undergoes a chemical reaction, and can be a 'monopropellant' such as [[hydrazine]], [[nitrous oxide]] or [[hydrogen peroxide]] that can be [[catalyst|catalytically]] decomposed to hot gas.\n\nAlternatively, an inert propellant can be used that can be externally heated, such as in [[steam rocket]], [[solar thermal rocket]] or [[nuclear thermal rocket]]s.<ref name=\"RPE7\"/>\n\nFor smaller, low performance rockets such as [[attitude control thruster]]s where high performance is less necessary, a pressurised fluid is used as propellant that simply escapes the spacecraft through a propelling nozzle.<ref name=\"RPE7\"/>\n\n==Uses==\nRockets or other similar [[reaction engine|reaction devices]] carrying their own propellant must be used when there is no other substance (land, water, or air) or force ([[gravity]], [[magnetism]], [[light]]) that a [[vehicle]] may usefully employ for propulsion, such as in space. In these circumstances, it is necessary to carry all the [[propellant]] to be used.\n\nHowever, they are also useful in other situations:\n\n===Military===\n{{main article|Missile}}\n[[File:Trident II missile image.jpg|upright|thumb|A [[Trident (missile)|Trident II missile]] launched from sea.]]\n\nSome military weapons use rockets to propel [[warhead]]s to their targets. A rocket and its payload together are generally referred to as a ''[[missile]]'' when the weapon has a [[guidance system]] (not all missiles use rocket engines, some use other engines such as [[jet engine|jet]]s) or as a ''[[rocket (weapon)|rocket]]'' if it is unguided. Anti-tank and [[anti-aircraft missile]]s use rocket engines to engage targets at high speed at a range of several miles, while intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver [[multiple nuclear warheads]] from thousands of miles, and [[anti-ballistic missile]]s try to stop them. Rockets have also been tested for [[reconnaissance]], such as the [[Ping-Pong (rocket)|Ping-Pong rocket]], which was launched to surveil enemy targets, however, recon rockets have never come into wide use in the military.\n\n===Science and research===\n[[File:Bumper.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Bumper (rocket)|Bumper]] sounding rocket]]\n{{See also| Space probe}}\n[[Sounding rocket]]s are commonly used to carry instruments that take readings from {{convert|50|km|mi|sp=us}} to {{convert|1500|km|mi|sp=us}} above the surface of the Earth.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Elaine|last1=Marconi:KSC|title=NASA - What is a Sounding Rocket?|url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/f_sounding.html|website=www.nasa.gov|accessdate=28 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nRocket engines are also used to propel [[rocket sled]]s along a rail at extremely high speed.

In this case, the nozzle itself does not push the balloon but is pulled by it. A convergent/divergent nozzle would be better.]]\n{{Main article|Rocket engine}}\n\nThe [[Reaction (physics)|effect]] of the combustion of propellant in the rocket engine is to increase the velocity of the resulting gases to very high speeds, hence producing a thrust.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}{{dubious|reason=so we don't need a nozzle then?|date=February 2016}} Initially, the gases of combustion are sent in every direction, but only those that produce a net thrust have any effect.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}{{dubious|reason=really, send them in all directions do we?|date=February 2016}} The ideal direction of motion of the exhaust is in the direction so as to cause thrust. At the top end of the combustion chamber the hot, energetic gas fluid cannot move forward, and so, it pushes upward against the top of the rocket engine's [[combustion chamber]]. As the combustion gases approach the exit of the combustion chamber, they increase in speed. The effect of the [[Rocket engine nozzle|convergent]] part of the rocket engine nozzle on the high pressure fluid of combustion gases, is to cause the gases to accelerate to high speed. The higher the speed of the gases, the lower the pressure of the gas ([[Bernoulli's principle]] or [[conservation of energy]]) acting on that part of the combustion chamber. In a properly designed engine, the flow will reach Mach 1 at the throat of the nozzle. At which point the speed of the flow increases. Beyond the throat of the nozzle, a bell shaped expansion part of the engine allows the gases that are expanding to push against that part of the rocket engine. Thus, the bell part of the nozzle gives additional thrust. Simply expressed, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, according to [[Newton's third law]] with the result that the exiting gases produce the reaction of a force on the rocket causing it to accelerate the rocket.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Warren|first1=J.

The hose is acting like a rocket engine. The hose is throwing water in one direction, and the firefighters are using their strength and weight to counteract the reaction. If they were to let go of the hose, it would thrash around with tremendous force.

If an opening is provided in the bottom of the chamber then the pressure is no longer acting on the missing section. This opening permits the exhaust to escape. The remaining pressures give a resultant thrust on the side opposite the opening, and these pressures are what push the rocket along.\n\nThe shape of the nozzle is important. Consider a balloon propelled by air coming out of a tapering nozzle. In such a case the combination of air pressure and viscous friction is such that the nozzle does not push the balloon but is ''pulled'' by it.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Warren|first1=J.

If propellant gas is continuously added to the chamber then these pressures can be maintained for as long as propellant remains. Note that in the case of liquid propellant engines, the pumps moving the propellant into the combustion chamber must maintain a pressure larger than the combustion chamber -typically on the order of 100 atmospheres.<ref name=\"RPE7\"/>\n\nAs a side effect, these pressures on the rocket also act on the exhaust in the opposite direction and accelerate this exhaust to very high speeds (according to [[Newton's Third Law]]).<ref name=\"RPE7\"/> From the principle of [[conservation of momentum]] the speed of the exhaust of a rocket determines how much momentum increase is created for a given amount of propellant. This is called the rocket's ''[[specific impulse]]''.<ref name=\"RPE7\"/> Because a rocket, propellant and exhaust in flight, without any external perturbations, may be considered as a closed system, the total momentum is always constant. Therefore, the faster the net speed of the exhaust in one direction, the greater the speed of the rocket can achieve in the opposite direction. This is especially true since the rocket body's mass is typically far lower than the final total exhaust mass.\n\n===Forces on a rocket in flight===\n[[File:Rktfor.gif|thumb|upright|Forces on a rocket in flight]]\nThe general study of the [[force]]s on a rocket is part of the field of [[ballistics]].

However, the effective exhaust velocity allows for various losses, and notably, is reduced when operated within an atmosphere.\n\nThe rate of propellant flow through a rocket engine is often deliberately varied over a flight, to provide a way to control the thrust and thus the airspeed of the vehicle. This, for example, allows minimization of aerodynamic losses<ref name=maxq/> and can limit the increase of [[g-force|''g''-forces]] due to the reduction in propellant load.\n\n===Total impulse===\n{{Main article|Impulse (physics)}}\nImpulse is defined as a force acting on an object over time, which in the absence of opposing forces (gravity and aerodynamic drag), changes the [[momentum]] (integral of mass and velocity) of the object. As such, it is the best performance class (payload mass and terminal velocity capability) indicator of a rocket, rather than takeoff thrust, mass, or \"power\". The total impulse of a rocket (stage) burning its propellant is:<ref name=\"RPE7\"/>{{rp|27}}\n\n:<math>I = \\int F dt</math>\n\nWhen there is fixed thrust, this is simply:\n\n:<math>I = F t\\;</math>\n\nThe total impulse of a multi-stage rocket is the sum of the impulses of the individual stages.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Specific impulse===\n{{Main article|specific impulse}}\n{{Specific impulse|align=right}}\nAs can be seen from the thrust equation, the effective speed of the exhaust controls the amount of thrust produced from a particular quantity of fuel burnt per second.\n\nAn equivalent measure, the net impulse per weight unit of propellant expelled, is called [[Specific impulse|specific Impulse]], <math>I_{sp}</math>, and this is one of the most important figures that describes a rocket's performance.

Some theoretical designs have rockets with delta-v's over 9&nbsp;km/s.\n\nThe required delta-v can also be calculated for a particular manoeuvre; for example the delta-v to launch from the surface of the Earth to [[Low earth orbit]] is about 9.7&nbsp;km/s, which leaves the vehicle with a sideways speed of about 7.8&nbsp;km/s at an altitude of around 200&nbsp;km. In this manoeuvre about 1.9&nbsp;km/s is lost in [[air drag]], [[gravity drag]] and [[potential energy|gaining altitude]].\n\nThe ratio <math>\\frac {m_0} {m_1}</math> is sometimes called the ''mass ratio''.\n\n===Mass ratios===\n[[File:Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.svg|thumb|The Tsiolkovsky rocket equation gives a relationship between the mass ratio and the final velocity in multiples of the exhaust speed]]\n\n{{Main article|mass ratio}}\nAlmost all of a launch vehicle's mass consists of propellant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Srockhis.htm |title=The Evolution of Rockets |publisher=Istp.gsfc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref> Mass ratio is, for any 'burn', the ratio between the rocket's initial mass and its final mass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/rktwtp.html |title=Rocket Mass Ratios |publisher=Exploration.grc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref> Everything else being equal, a high mass ratio is desirable for good performance, since it indicates that the rocket is lightweight and hence performs better, for essentially the same reasons that low weight is desirable in sports cars.\n\nRockets as a group have the highest [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] of any type of engine; and this helps vehicles achieve high [[mass ratio]]s, which improves the performance of flights. The higher the ratio, the less engine mass is needed to be carried. This permits the carrying of even more propellant, enormously improving the delta-v. Alternatively, some rockets such as for rescue scenarios or racing carry relatively little propellant and payload and thus need only a lightweight structure and instead achieve high accelerations. For example, the Soyuz escape system can produce 20g.<ref name=soyuzt/>\n\nAchievable mass ratios are highly dependent on many factors such as propellant type, the design of engine the vehicle uses, structural safety margins and construction techniques.\n\nThe highest mass ratios are generally achieved with liquid rockets, and these types are usually used for [[orbital launch vehicle]]s, a situation which calls for a high delta-v. Liquid propellants generally have densities similar to water (with the notable exceptions of [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[Liquid methane rocket fuel|liquid methane]]), and these types are able to use lightweight, low pressure tanks and typically run high-performance [[turbopumps]] to force the propellant into the combustion chamber.\n\nSome notable mass fractions are found in the following table (some aircraft are included for comparison purposes):\n\n{{Mass fraction table}}\n\n===Staging===\n[[File:Artistsconcept separation.jpg|thumb|Spacecraft staging involves dropping off unnecessary parts of the rocket to reduce mass.]]\n[[File:Ap6-68-HC-191.jpg|thumb|[[Apollo 6]] while dropping the interstage ring]]\n{{Main article|Multistage rocket}}\nThus far, the required velocity (delta-v) to achieve orbit has been unattainable by any single rocket because the [[propellant]], tankage, structure, [[guidance system|guidance]], valves and engines and so on, take a particular minimum percentage of take-off mass that is too great for the propellant it carries to achieve that delta-v. Since [[Single-stage-to-orbit]] has so far not been achievable, orbital rockets always have more than one stage.\n\nFor example, the first stage of the Saturn V, carrying the weight of the upper stages, was able to achieve a [[mass ratio]] of about 10, and achieved a specific impulse of 263 seconds. This gives a delta-v of around 5.9&nbsp;km/s whereas around 9.4&nbsp;km/s delta-v is needed to achieve orbit with all losses allowed for.\n\nThis problem is frequently solved by [[staging (rocketry)|staging]]&nbsp;\u2014 the rocket sheds excess weight (usually empty tankage and associated engines) during launch. Staging is either ''serial'' where the rockets light after the previous stage has fallen away, or ''parallel'', where rockets are burning together and then detach when they burn out.<ref name=\"NASAstaging\">{{cite web |author=NASA |url=https://spaceflightsystems.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/rktstage.html |title=Rocket staging |accessdate=2016-05-28 |publisher=NASA |work=Beginner's Guide to Rockets |year=2006}}</ref>\n\nThe maximum speeds that can be achieved with staging is theoretically limited only by the speed of light. However the payload that can be carried goes down geometrically with each extra stage needed, while the additional delta-v for each stage is simply additive.\n\n===Acceleration and thrust-to-weight ratio===\n{{Main article|thrust-to-weight ratio}}\nFrom Newton's second law, the acceleration, <math>a</math>, of a vehicle is simply:\n\n:<math>a = \\frac {F_n} {m}</math>\nWhere m is the instantaneous mass of the vehicle and <math>F_n</math> is the net force acting on the rocket (mostly thrust but air drag and other forces can play a part.)\n\nAs the remaining propellant decreases, rocket vehicles become lighter and their acceleration tends to increase until the propellant is exhausted. This means that much of the speed change occurs towards the end of the burn when the vehicle is much lighter.<ref name=\"RPE7\"/> However, the thrust can be throttled to offset or vary this if needed. Discontinuities in acceleration also occur when stages burn out, often starting at a lower acceleration with each new stage firing.\n\nPeak accelerations can be increased by designing the vehicle with a reduced mass, usually achieved by a reduction in the fuel load and tankage and associated structures, but obviously this reduces range, delta-v and burn time. Still, for some applications that rockets are used for, a high peak acceleration applied for just a short time is highly desirable.\n\nThe minimal mass of vehicle consists of a rocket engine with minimal fuel and structure to carry it. In that case the [[thrust-to-weight ratio]]{{#tag:ref|\u201cthrust-to-weight ratio F/W<sub>g</sub> is a dimensionless parameter that is identical to the acceleration of the rocket propulsion system (expressed in multiples of g<sub>0</sub>) ... in a gravity-free vacuum\u201d<ref name=\"RPE7\"/>{{rp|442}}|group=nb}} of the rocket engine limits the maximum acceleration that can be designed.

For these operations to be done it is necessary for a vehicle's engines to provide more than the local [[gravitational acceleration]].\n\n===Energy===\n\n====Energy efficiency====\n[[File:Atlantis taking off on STS-27.jpg|thumb|{{OV|104}} during launch phase]]\n{{Main article|propulsive efficiency}}\nRocket launch vehicles take-off with a great deal of flames, noise and drama, and it might seem obvious that they are grievously inefficient. However, while they are far from perfect, their energy efficiency is not as bad as might be supposed.\n\nThe energy density of a typical rocket propellant is often around one-third that of conventional hydrocarbon fuels; the bulk of the mass is (often relatively inexpensive) oxidizer. Nevertheless, at take-off the rocket has a great deal of energy in the fuel and oxidizer stored within the vehicle. It is of course desirable that as much of the energy of the propellant end up as [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] or [[potential energy]] of the body of the rocket as possible.\n\nEnergy from the fuel is lost in air drag and [[gravity drag]] and is used for the rocket to gain altitude and speed. However, much of the lost energy ends up in the exhaust.<ref name=\"RPE7\"/>{{rp|37\u201338}}\n\nIn a chemical propulsion device, the engine efficiency is simply the ratio of the kinetic power of the exhaust gases and the power available from the chemical reaction:<ref name=\"RPE7\"/>{{rp|37\u201338}}\n\n:<math>\\eta_c= \\frac {\\frac {1} {2}\\dot{m}v_e^2} {\\eta_{combustion} P_{chem} }</math>\n\n100% efficiency within the engine (engine efficiency <math>\\eta_c = 100\\%</math>) would mean that all the heat energy of the combustion products is converted into kinetic energy of the jet. [[Heat Engine#Efficiency|This is not possible]], but the near-adiabatic [[rocket engine nozzle|high expansion ratio nozzles]] that can be used with rockets come surprisingly close: when the nozzle expands the gas, the gas is cooled and accelerated, and an energy efficiency of up to 70% can be achieved. Most of the rest is heat energy in the exhaust that is not recovered.<ref name=\"RPE7\"/>{{rp|37\u201338}} The high efficiency is a consequence of the fact that rocket combustion can be performed at very high temperatures and the gas is finally released at much lower temperatures, and so giving good [[Carnot efficiency]].\n\nHowever, engine efficiency is not the whole story. In common with the other [[jet engine|jet-based engines]], but particularly in rockets due to their high and typically fixed exhaust speeds, rocket vehicles are extremely inefficient at low speeds irrespective of the engine efficiency. The problem is that at low speeds, the exhaust carries away a huge amount of [[kinetic energy]] rearward. This phenomenon is termed [[propulsive efficiency]] (<math>\\eta_p</math>).<ref name=\"RPE7\"/>{{rp|37\u201338}}\n\nHowever, as speeds rise, the resultant exhaust speed goes down, and the overall vehicle energetic efficiency rises, reaching a peak of around 100% of the engine efficiency when the vehicle is travelling exactly at the same speed that the exhaust is emitted. In this case the exhaust would ideally stop dead in space behind the moving vehicle, taking away zero energy, and from conservation of energy, all the energy would end up in the vehicle. The efficiency then drops off again at even higher speeds as the exhaust ends up travelling forwards- trailing behind the vehicle.\n\n[[File:Average propulsive efficiency of rockets.png|thumb|Plot of instantaneous propulsive efficiency (blue) and overall efficiency for a rocket accelerating from rest (red) as percentages of the engine efficiency]]From these principles it can be shown that the propulsive efficiency <math>\\eta_p</math> for a rocket moving at speed <math>u</math> with an exhaust velocity <math>c</math> is:\n:<math>\\eta_p= \\frac {2 \\frac {u} {c}} {1 + ( \\frac {u} {c} )^2 }</math><ref name=\"RPE7\"/>{{rp|37\u201338}}\n\nAnd the overall (instantaneous) energy efficiency <math>\\eta</math> is:\n:<math>\\eta= \\eta_p \\eta_c</math>\n\nFor example, from the equation, with an <math>\\eta_c</math> of 0.7, a rocket flying at Mach 0.85 (which most aircraft cruise at) with an exhaust velocity of Mach 10, would have a predicted overall energy efficiency of 5.9%, whereas a conventional, modern, air-breathing jet engine achieves closer to 35% efficiency. Thus a rocket would need about 6x more energy; and allowing for the specific energy of rocket propellant being around one third that of conventional air fuel, roughly 18x more mass of propellant would need to be carried for the same journey. This is why rockets are rarely if ever used for general aviation.\n\nSince the energy ultimately comes from fuel, these considerations mean that rockets are mainly useful when a very high speed is required, such as [[ICBM]]s or [[orbital spaceflight|orbital launch]]. For example, [[NASA]]'s [[space shuttle]] fires its engines for around 8.5 minutes, consuming 1,000&nbsp;tonnes of solid propellant (containing 16% aluminium) and an additional 2,000,000&nbsp;litres of liquid propellant (106,261&nbsp;kg of [[liquid hydrogen]] fuel) to lift the 100,000&nbsp;kg vehicle (including the 25,000&nbsp;kg payload) to an altitude of 111&nbsp;km and an orbital [[velocity]] of 30,000&nbsp;km/h. At this altitude and velocity, the vehicle has a kinetic energy of about 3&nbsp;TJ and a potential energy of roughly 200&nbsp;GJ. Given the initial energy of 20&nbsp;TJ,{{#tag:ref|The energy density is 31MJ per kg for aluminum and 143&nbsp;MJ/kg for liquid hydrogen, this means that the vehicle consumes around 5&nbsp;TJ of solid propellant and 15&nbsp;TJ of hydrogen fuel.|group=nb}} the Space Shuttle is about 16% energy efficient at launching the orbiter.\n\nThus jet engines, with a better match between speed and jet exhaust speed (such as [[turbofans]]\u2014in spite of their worse <math>\\eta_c</math>)\u2014dominate for subsonic and supersonic atmospheric use, while rockets work best at hypersonic speeds. On the other hand, rockets serve in many short-range ''relatively'' low speed military applications where their low-speed inefficiency is outweighed by their extremely high thrust and hence high accelerations.\n\n====Oberth effect====\n{{Main article|Oberth effect}}\n{{Off topic|date=May 2016|Orbital maneuver}}\nOne subtle feature of rockets relates to energy. A rocket stage, while carrying a given load, is capable of giving a particular [[delta-v]]. This delta-v means that the speed increases (or decreases) by a particular amount, independent of the initial speed. However, because [[kinetic energy]] is a square law on speed, this means that the faster the rocket is travelling before the burn the more [[orbital energy]] it gains or loses.\n\nThis fact is used in interplanetary travel. It means that the amount of delta-v to reach other planets, over and above that to reach escape velocity can be much less if the delta-v is applied when the rocket is travelling at high speeds, close to the Earth or other planetary surface; whereas waiting until the rocket has slowed at altitude multiplies up the effort required to achieve the desired trajectory.\n\n==Safety, reliability and accidents==\n[[File:Challenger explosion.jpg|thumb|[[Space Shuttle Challenger]] was torn apart T+73 seconds after hot gases escaped the [[Solid rocket booster|SRBs]], causing the breakup of the Shuttle stack]]\n{{See also| List of spaceflight-related accidents and incidents}}\n{{Expand section|date=May 2016}}\nThe reliability of rockets, as for all physical systems, is dependent on the quality of engineering design and construction.\n\nBecause of the enormous chemical energy in [[rocket propellant]]s (greater energy by weight than explosives, but lower than [[gasoline]]), consequences of accidents can be severe.

However propellant is seldom more than a few times more expensive than gasoline per kilogram (as of 2009 gasoline was about {{convert|1|$/kg|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} or less), and although substantial amounts are needed, for all but the very cheapest rockets, it turns out that the propellant costs are usually comparatively small, although not completely negligible.<ref name=aday/> With liquid oxygen costing {{convert|0.15|$/kg}} and liquid hydrogen {{convert|2.20|$/kg|abbr=on}}, the [[Space Shuttle]] in 2009 had a liquid propellant expense of approximately $1.4 million for each launch that cost $450 million from other expenses (with 40% of the mass of propellants used by it being liquids in the [[external fuel tank]], 60% solids in the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|SRBs]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/nasafact/pdf/ssp.pdf |title=Space Shuttle Use of Propellants and Fluids |publisher=Nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017180215/http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/nasafact/pdf/SSP.pdf |archivedate=October 17, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/nasafact/count2.htm |title=NASA Launch Vehicles and Facilities |publisher=Nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/information/shuttle_faq.html |title=NASA - Space Shuttle and International Space Station |publisher=Nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-04-30}}</ref>\n\nEven though a rocket's non-propellant, dry mass is often only between 5-20% of total mass,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spacetethers.com/massfraction.html |title=Mass Fraction |publisher=Andrews Space and Technology (original figure source) |date= |accessdate=2011-04-30}}</ref> nevertheless this cost dominates.
