Heating is usually achieved by sending [[electricity]] through a [[resistor]] consisting of a hot incandescent filament, with the expanded gas expelled through a conventional nozzle.<ref name=\"electric-propulsion-encyclopedia\">[http://alfven.princeton.edu/publications/ep-encyclopedia-2001 Electric Propulsion article in Encyclopedia of Physical Science and Technology, 3rd Edition, Academic Press, San Diego, v.5, pp. 125-141, 2002]</ref>\n\nResistojets have been flown in space since 1965 on board military [[Vela (satellite)|Vela satellites]]. However, they only became used in commercial applications in 1980 with the launch of the first satellites in the [[Intelsat|INTELSAT-V]] program. Many GEO spacecraft, and all 95 [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium]], used Aerojet [[MR-501]]/[[MR-502]] series resistojet engines. <ref name=\"electric-propulsion-encyclopedia\" /><ref>{{cite book|title=30 Years of Electric Propulsion Flight Experience at Aerojet Rocketdyne|publisher=IEPC-2013-439|page=2|accessdate=14 August 2015}}</ref>Nowadays resistojet propulsion is used for [[orbit insertion]], [[attitude control]], and [[deorbit]] of [[Low Earth orbit|LEO]] satellites, and do well in situations where energy is much more plentiful than mass, and where propulsion efficiency needs to be reasonably high but low [[thrust]] is acceptable.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2005-4260''A Xenon Resistojet Propulsion System for Microsatellites''] (Surrey Space Centre, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey) (Purchasable document) \n* [http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMNEYAOE1G_UnitedKingdom_0.html Two new ESA satellites successfully lofted into orbit] (European Space Agency)\n* [http://www.alta-space.com/index.php?page=resistojet Resistojet Propulsion System for Microsatellites] (Alta, Italy)\n{{spacecraft propulsion}}\n\n[[Category:Rocket propulsion]]\n\n\n{{rocket-stub}}"}]}}}}
