Lobbying is often spoken of with [[contempt]], the implication is that people with inordinate [[Power (social and political)|socioeconomic power]] are [[corruption|corrupting]] the [[law]] in order to serve their own interests.  When people who have a [[duty]] to act on behalf of others, such as elected officials with a duty to serve their constituents' interests or more broadly the [[common good]], stand to benefit by shaping the law to serve the interests of some private parties, there is a conflict of interest.
