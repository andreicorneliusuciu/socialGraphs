New York: Jeremy P. Tarcher/Putnam. ISBN 0-87477-975-8.</ref>   A magnetic sail could also thrust directly against planetary and solar [[magnetosphere]]s.\n\n== History ==\nThe magnetic sail was proposed by [[Dana Andrews (inventor)|Dana Andrews]] and [[Robert Zubrin]] working in collaboration in 1988. At that time, Andrews was working on a concept to use a magnetic scoop to gather ions to provide propellant for a nuclear electric ion drive spacecraft, allowing the craft to operate in the same manner of a [[Bussard ramjet]], but without the need for a proton-proton fusion propulsion drive. He asked Zubrin to help him compute the drag that the magnetic scoop would create against the interplanetary medium. Zubrin agreed, but found that the drag created by the scoop would be much greater than the thrust created by the ion drive. He therefore proposed that the ion drive component of the system be dropped, and the device simply used as a sail. Andrews agreed, and the magsail was born. The two then proceeded to elaborate their analysis of the magsail for interplanetary, interstellar, and planetary orbital propulsion in a series of papers published from 1988 through the 1990s.\n\n== Principles of operation and design ==\n\nThe ''magsail'' operates by creating drag against the local medium (planet's magnetic field, solar wind, or interstellar winds), thereby allowing a spacecraft accelerated to very high velocities by other means, such as a fusion rocket or laser pushed lightsail, to slow down - even from relativistic velocities - without requiring the use of onboard propellant. It can thus reduce the [[delta-V]] propulsion required for an interstellar mission by a factor of two. This capability is the most unusual feature of the magsail, and perhaps the most significant in the long term.\n\nIn typical magnetic sail designs, the magnetic field is generated by a loop of [[superconductor|superconducting]] wire. Because loops of current-carrying conductors tend to be forced outwards towards a circular shape by their own magnetic field, the sail could be deployed simply by unspooling the conductor and applying a current through it.\n\n=== Solar wind example ===\n\nThe [[solar wind]] is a continuous stream of plasma that flows outwards from the Sun: near the Earth's orbit, it contains several million [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s per cubic meter and flows at {{convert|400|to|600|km/s|abbr=on}}. The magnetic sail introduces a magnetic field into this plasma flow which can deflect the particles from their original trajectory: the momentum of the particles is then transferred to the sail, leading to a thrust on the sail. One advantage of magnetic or solar sails over (chemical or ion) reaction thrusters is that no reaction mass is depleted or carried in the craft.\n\nFor a sail in the solar wind one [[Astronomical unit|AU]] away from the Sun, the field strength required to resist the dynamic pressure of the solar wind is 50 nT. [[Robert Zubrin|Zubrin]]'s proposed magnetic sail design would create a bubble of space of {{convert|100|km|0|adj=mid|in diameter|abbr=on}} where solar-wind ions are substantially deflected using a hoop {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} in radius. The minimum mass of such a coil is constrained by material strength limitations at roughly {{convert|40|tonne}} and it would generate {{convert|70|N|abbr=on}} of thrust,<ref name=05ja026_full>[http://www.psfc.mit.edu/library1/catalog/reports/2000/05ja/05ja026/05ja026_full.pdf]</ref> giving a mass/thrust ratio of 600&nbsp;kg/N. If operated within the solar system, high temperature superconducting wire would be required to make the magsail practical. If operated in interstellar space conventional superconductors would be adequate.\n\nThe operation of magnetic sails using plasma wind is analogous to the operation of solar sails using the radiation pressure of photons emitted by the Sun. Although solar wind particles have rest mass and photons do not, sunlight has thousands of times more momentum than the solar wind. Therefore, a magnetic sail must deflect a proportionally larger area of the solar wind than a comparable solar sail to generate the same amount of thrust. However, it need not be as massive as a solar sail because the solar wind is deflected by a magnetic field instead of a large physical sail. Conventional materials for solar sails weigh around {{convert|7|g/m2|abbr=on}}, giving a thrust of {{convert|0.01|mPa|abbr=on}} at {{convert|1|AU|abbr=on}}. This gives a mass/thrust ratio of at least 700&nbsp;kg/N, similar to a magnetic sail, neglecting other structural components.\n\nThe [[solar sail|solar]] and magnetic sails have a thrust that falls off as the square of the distance from the Sun.\n\nWhen close to a planet with a strong [[magnetosphere]] such as [[Earth]] or a [[gas giant]], the magnetic sail could generate more thrust by interacting with the magnetosphere instead of the solar wind, and may therefore be more efficient.\n\n== Mini-magnetospheric plasma propulsion (M2P2) ==\n\nIn order to reduce the size and weight of the [[magnet]] of the magnetic sail, it may be possible to ''inflate'' the magnetic field using a plasma in the same way that the plasma around the Earth stretches out the Earth's magnetic field in the [[magnetosphere]]. In this approach, called '''mini-magnetospheric plasma propulsion''' (M2P2), currents that run through the plasma will augment and partially replace the currents in the coil. This is expected to be especially useful far from the Sun, where the increased effective size of a M2P2 sail compensates for the reduced dynamic pressure of the solar wind. The original [[NASA]] design<ref>Mini-magnetospheric Plasma Propulsion: Tapping the energy of the solar wind for spacecraft propulsion, Journal of Geophysical Research, volume 105, A9, pages 21,067-21,077 2000</ref> proposes a spacecraft containing a can-shaped electromagnet into which a plasma is injected. The [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] pressure stretches the magnetic field and inflates a bubble of plasma around the spacecraft. The plasma then generates a kind of miniaturized magnetosphere around the spacecraft, analogous to the [[magnetosphere]] that surrounds the Earth. The protons and electrons which make up the [[solar wind]] are deflected by this magnetosphere and the reaction accelerates the spacecraft. The thrust of the M2P2 device would be steerable to some extent, potentially allowing the spacecraft to 'tack' into the solar wind and allowing efficient changes of orbit.\n\nIn the case of the (M2P2) system the spacecraft releases gas to create the plasma needed to maintain the somewhat leaky plasma bubble. The M2P2 system therefore has an effective ''[[specific impulse]]'' which is the amount of gas consumed per newton second of thrust. This is a figure of merit usually used for rockets, where the fuel is actually reaction mass. Robert Winglee, who originally proposed the M2P2 technique, calculates a ''specific impulse'' of 200&nbsp;kN\u00b7s/kg (roughly 50 times better than the space shuttle main engine). These calculations suggest that the system requires on the order of a kilowatt of power per newton of thrust, considerably lower than electric thrusters, and that the system generates the same thrust anywhere within the [[Heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]] because the sail spreads automatically as the solar wind becomes less dense. However, this technique is less understood than the simpler magnetic sail and issues of how large and heavy the magnetic coil would have to be<ref name=05ja026_full/><ref>SAIL PROPULSION USING THE SOLAR WIND, Journal of Space Technology and Science, volume 20, pages 1-16, 2004</ref> or whether the momentum from the solar wind can be efficiently transferred to the spacecraft<ref>[http://www.ava.fmi.fi/~pjanhune/papers/winglee.pdf]</ref> are under dispute.\n\nThe expansion of the magnetic field using plasma injected has been successfully tested in a large vacuum chamber on [[Earth]], but the development of thrust was not part of the experiment. A [[Beam-powered propulsion|beam-powered]] variant, [[Magnetized beamed plasma propulsion|MagBeam]],<ref>[http://www.ess.washington.edu/Space/magbeam/ MagBeam<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> is also under development.\n\n== Modes of operation ==\n\n[[Image:Magsail-particle-wind.png|thumb|A magnetic sail in a wind of charged particles. The sail generates a magnetic field, represented by red arrows, which deflects the particles into the page. The force on the sail is out of the page.]]\n\n===In a plasma wind ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nWhen operating away from planetary magnetospheres, a magnetic sail would force the positively charged protons of the solar wind to curve as they passed through the magnetic field.  The change of momentum of the protons would thrust against the magnetic field, and thus against the field coil.\n\nJust as with solar sails, magnetic sails can \"tack.\" If a magnetic sail orients at an angle relative to the solar wind, charged particles are deflected preferentially to one side and the magnetic sail is pushed laterally. This means that magnetic sails could maneuver to most orbits.\n\nIn this mode, the amount of thrust generated by a magnetic sail falls off with the square of its distance from the Sun as the [[flux]] density of charged particles reduces.  Solar weather also has major effects on the sail.  It is possible that the plasma eruption from a severe solar flare could damage  an efficient, fragile sail.\n\nA common misconception is that a magnetic sail cannot exceed the speed of the plasma pushing it.  As the speed of a magnetic sail increases, its acceleration becomes more dependent on its ability to tack efficiently.  At high speeds, the plasma wind's direction will seem to come increasingly from the front of the spacecraft.  Advanced sailing spacecraft might deploy field coils as \"keels,\" so the spacecraft could use the difference in vector between the solar magnetic field and the solar wind, much as sailing yachts do.\n\n=== Inside a planetary magnetosphere ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2007}}\n[[Image:Gradb force on ring.svg|thumb|A magnetic sail in a spatially varying magnetic field. Because the vertical external field B<sub>ext</sub> is stronger on one side than the other, the leftward force on the left side of the ring is smaller than the rightward force on the right side of the ring, and the net force on the sail is to the right.]]\n\nInside a planetary magnetosphere, a magnetic sail can thrust against a planet's magnetic field, especially in an [[orbit]] that passes over the planet's magnetic poles, in a similar manner to an [[electrodynamic tether]].\n\nThe range of maneuvers available to a magnetic sail inside a planetary magnetosphere are more limited than in a plasma wind. Just as with the more familiar small-scale magnets used on Earth, a magnetic sail can only be attracted towards the magnetosphere's poles or repelled from them, depending on its orientation.\n\nWhen the magnetic sail's field is oriented in the opposite direction to the magnetosphere it experiences a force inward and toward the nearest pole, and when it is oriented in the same direction as the magnetosphere it experiences the opposite effect. A magnetic sail oriented in the same direction as the magnetosphere is not stable, and will have to prevent itself from being flipped over to the opposite orientation by some other means.\n\nThe thrust that a magnetic sail delivers within a magnetosphere decreases with the fourth power of its distance from the planet's internal magnetic dynamo.\n\nThis limited maneuvering capability is still quite useful. By varying the magnetic sail's field strength over the course of its orbit, a magnetic sail can give itself a \"[[perigee]] kick\" raising the altitude of its orbit's [[apogee]].\n\nRepeating this process with each orbit can drive the magnetic sail's apogee higher and higher, until the magnetic sail is able to leave the planetary magnetosphere and catch the solar wind. The same process in reverse can be used to lower or circularize the apogee of a magsail's orbit when it arrives at a destination planet.\n\nIn theory, it is possible for a magnetic sail to launch directly from the surface of a planet near one of its magnetic poles, repelling itself from the planet's magnetic field. However, this requires the magnetic sail to be maintained in its \"unstable\" orientation.  A launch from Earth requires superconductors with 80 times the current density of the best known high-temperature superconductors.\n\n=== Interstellar travel ===\n\nInterstellar space contains very small amounts of hydrogen. A fast-moving sail would ionize this hydrogen by accelerating the electrons in one direction and the oppositely charged protons in the other direction. The energy for the ionization and [[cyclotron radiation]] would come from the spacecraft's kinetic energy, slowing the spacecraft. The cyclotron radiation from the acceleration of particles would be an easily detected howl in [[electromagnetic radiation|radio frequencies]].\n\nThus, in interstellar spaceflight outside the [[Heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]] of a star a magnetic sail could act as a [[parachute]] to decelerate a spacecraft.  This removes any fuel requirements for the deceleration half of an interstellar journey, which would benefit interstellar travel enormously.  The magsail was first proposed for this purpose in 1988 by [[Robert Zubrin]] and [[Dana Andrews (engineer)|Dana Andrews]], predating other uses, and evolved from a concept of the [[Bussard ramjet]] which used a magnetic scoop to collect [[interstellar medium|interstellar material]]. More recently a combination of magnetic sail and [[electric sail]] was proposed by Perakis and Hein.<ref>Perakis, N., & Hein, A. M. (2016). Combining Magnetic and Electric Sails for Interstellar Deceleration. arXiv preprint [http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03015 arXiv:1603.03015].</ref> The magnetic sail is used for deceleration from higher velocities and the electric sail at lower velocities. The simulation shows a considerable mass saving for the combined system.\n\nMagnetic sails could also be used with [[beam-powered propulsion]] by using a high-power [[particle accelerator]] to fire a beam of charged particles at the spacecraft.<ref>G. Landis, \"Interstellar Flight by Particle Beam,\" ''Acta Astronautica. Vol 55'', No. 11, 931-934 (Dec. 2004).</ref> The magsail would deflect this beam, transferring momentum to the vehicle. This would provide much higher acceleration than a solar sail driven by a [[laser]], but a charged particle beam would disperse in a shorter distance than a laser due to the electrostatic repulsion of its component particles.  This dispersion problem could potentially be resolved by accelerating a stream of sails which then in turn transfer their momentum to a magsail vehicle, as proposed by [[Jordin Kare]].\n\n== Fictional uses==\n\nThe ancestor of the magsail, the Bussard magnetic scoop, first appeared in science-fiction in [[Poul Anderson]]'s 1967 short story ''To Outlive Eternity'', which was followed by the novel ''[[Tau Zero]]'' in 1970. The magsail appears as a crucial plot device in ''The Children's Hour'', a ''[[Man-Kzin Wars]]'' novel by [[Jerry Pournelle]] and [[S.M. Stirling]] (1991).  It also features prominently in the science-fiction novels of [[Michael Flynn (author)|Michael Flynn]], particularly in ''The Wreck of the River of Stars'' (2003); this book is the tale of the last flight of a magnetic sail ship when [[fusion rocket]]s based on the [[Farnsworth-Hirsch Fusor]] have become the preferred technology.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight|Space}}\n* [[Electric sail]]\n* [[Electrodynamic tether]] interacts with magnetosphere in similar manner to magsail\n* [[MagBeam]] (Magnetized beamed plasma propulsion) \u2014 a beam-powered variant of [[Magnetic sail#Mini-magnetospheric plasma propulsion|mini-magnetospheric plasma propulsion]] (M2P2).\n* [[Spacecraft propulsion]] \u2014 Other methods of spacecraft propulsion used to change the velocity of spacecraft and artificial satellites.\n* [[List of plasma (physics) articles]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.jspf.or.jp/Journal/PDF_JSPF/jspf2007_03/jspf2007_03-281.pdf \u78c1\u6c17\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u30bb\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u7814\u7a76\u3068\u6df1\u5b87\u5b99\u63a2\u67fb\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226] (PDF)\n*[http://art.aees.kyushu-u.ac.jp/publications/2006/Mnoda.pdf MPS\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u78c1\u6c17\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u7814\u7a76] (PDF)\n*[http://airex.tksc.jaxa.jp/dr/prc/japan/contents/AA0064241011/64241011.pdf \u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u30bb\u30a4\u30eb] (PDF)\n*[http://www.jst.go.jp/kisoken/crest/report/heisei21/pdf/pdf21/21-017.pdf \u60d1\u661f\u9593\u822a\u884c\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u958b\u767a\u306b\u5411\u3051\u305f\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb\u7c92\u5b50\u30b7\u30df\u30e5\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3] (PDF)\n*[http://repository.tksc.jaxa.jp/dr/prc/japan/contents/AA0049193000/49193000.pdf \u78c1\u6c17\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u30bb\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u63a8\u529b\u767a\u751f\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0\u306e\u89e3\u660e] (PDF)\n\n{{Spacecraft propulsion}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Magnetic Sail}}\n[[Category:Spacecraft propulsion]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft components]]\n[[Category:Electrodynamics]]\n[[Category:Magnetic propulsion devices]]"}]}}}}
