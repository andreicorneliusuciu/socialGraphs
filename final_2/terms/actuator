The control signal is relatively low energy and may be electric voltage or current, pneumatic or hydraulic pressure, or even human power. The supplied main energy source may be [[electric current]], [[hydraulic fluid]] pressure, or [[pneumatic]] pressure. When the control signal is received, the actuator responds by converting the energy into mechanical motion.  \n\nAn actuator is the mechanism by which a control system acts upon an environment. The control system can be simple (a fixed mechanical or electronic system), software-based (e.g. a printer driver, robot control system), a human, or any other input.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thomasnet.com/about/actuators-301168.html|title=About Actuators|website=www.thomasnet.com|access-date=2016-04-26}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe history of the pneumatic actuation system and the hydraulic actuation system dates to around the time of [[World War II]] (1938). It was first created by Xhiter Anckeleman (pronounced 'Ziter'){{fact|date=March 2015}} who used his knowledge of [[Engine|engines]] and [[brake]] systems to come up with a new solution to ensure that the brakes on a car exert the maximum force, with the least possible wear and tear.\n\n===Hydraulic===\nA hydraulic actuator consists of  cylinder or fluid motor that uses hydraulic power to facilitate mechanical operation. The mechanical motion gives an output in terms of linear, rotatory or [[Oscillation|oscillatory]] motion. As liquids are nearly impossible to compress, a hydraulic actuator can exert a large force. The drawback of this approach is its limited acceleration.\n\nThe hydraulic cylinder consists of a hollow cylindrical tube along which a piston can slide. The term ''single acting'' is used when the fluid pressure is applied to just one side of the piston. The piston can move in only one direction, a spring being frequently used to give the piston a return stroke. The term ''double acting'' is used when pressure is applied on each side of the piston; any difference in pressure between the two sides of the piston moves the piston to one side or the other.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://machinedesign.com/linear-motion/what-s-difference-between-pneumatic-hydraulic-and-electrical-actuators|title=What\u2019s the Difference Between Pneumatic, Hydraulic, and Electrical Actuators?|website=machinedesign.com|access-date=2016-04-26}}</ref>\n\n===Pneumatic===\n[[File:Pneumatic Rack and Pinion Actuators.JPG|thumb|upright|Pneumatic [[rack and pinion]] actuators for valve controls of water pipes]]\n\nA pneumatic actuator converts energy formed by vacuum or [[compressed air]] at high pressure into either linear or rotary motion. Pneumatic energy is desirable for main engine controls because it can quickly respond in starting and stopping as the power source does not need to be stored in reserve for operation.\n\nPneumatic actuators enable considerable forces to be produced from relatively small pressure changes. These forces are often used with valves to move diaphragms to affect the flow of liquid through the valve.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalspec.com/learnmore/flow_transfer_control/valve_actuators_positioners/pneumatic_valve_actuators|title=Pneumatic Valve Actuators Information {{!}} IHS Engineering360|website=www.globalspec.com|access-date=2016-04-26}}</ref>\n\n===Electric===\nAn electric actuator is powered by a motor that converts electrical energy into mechanical torque. The electrical energy is used to actuate equipment such as multi-turn valves. It is one of the cleanest and most readily available forms of actuator because it does not involve oil.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.baelzna.com/actuators/|title=Electric & Pneumatic Actuators|website=www.baelzna.com|access-date=2016-04-26}}</ref>\n\n===Thermal or magnetic (shape memory alloys)===\nActuators which can be actuated by applying thermal or magnetic energy have been used in commercial applications. They tend to be compact, lightweight, economical and with high power density. These actuators use shape memory materials (SMMs), such as [[shape memory alloy]]s (SMAs) or [[magnetic shape-memory alloy]]s (MSMAs). Some popular manufacturers of these devices are Finnish [[Modti inc.|Modti Inc]]., American Dynalloy and Rotork.\n\n===Mechanical===\nA mechanical actuator functions to execute movement by converting one kind of motion, such as [[rotary motion]], into another kind, such as [[linear motion]]. An example is a [[rack and pinion]]. The operation of mechanical actuators is based on combinations of structural components, such as [[gear]]s and rails, or [[pulley]]s and [[chain]]s.\n\n== Examples and applications ==\nIn [[engineering]], actuators are frequently used as mechanisms to introduce motion, or to clamp an object so as to prevent motion. In electronic engineering, actuators are a subdivision of [[transducers]]. They are devices which transform an input signal (mainly an electrical signal) into some form of motion.\n\n===Examples of actuators===\n* [[Comb drive]]\n* [[Digital micromirror device]] \n* [[Electric motor]]\n* [[Electroactive polymer]]\n* [[Hydraulic cylinder]]\n* [[Piezoelectric actuator]]\n* [[Pneumatic actuator]]\n* [[Screw jack]]\n* [[Servomechanism]]\n* [[Solenoid]]\n* [[Stepper motor]]\n* [[Shape-memory alloy]]\n* Thermal [[bimorph]]\n\n===Circular to linear conversion===\nMotors are mostly used when circular motions are needed, but can also be used for linear applications by transforming circular to linear motion with a [[lead screw]] or similar mechanism. On the other hand, some actuators are intrinsically linear, such as piezoelectric actuators.  Conversion between circular and linear motion is commonly made via a few simple types of mechanism including:\n* [[Screw (simple machine)|Screw]]: [[Screw jack]], [[ball screw]] and [[roller screw]] actuators all operate on the principle of the [[simple machine]] known as the screw. By rotating the actuator's nut, the screw shaft moves in a line.  By moving the screw shaft, the nut rotates.\n* [[Wheel and axle]]: [[Hoist (device)|Hoist]], [[winch]], [[rack and pinion]], [[chain drive]], [[belt drive]], [[rigid chain actuator|rigid chain]] and [[rigid belt actuator|rigid belt]] actuators operate on the principle of the wheel and axle. By rotating a wheel/axle (e.g. [[Cylinder (geometry)|drum]], [[gear]], [[pulley]] or [[Drive shaft|shaft]]) a linear member (e.g. [[Wire rope|cable]], rack, [[Roller chain|chain]] or [[Belt (mechanical)|belt]]) moves.  By moving the linear member, the wheel/axle rotates.<ref>Sclater, N., ''Mechanisms and Mechanical Devices Sourcebook, 4th Edition'' (2007), 25, McGraw-Hill</ref>\n\n===Virtual instrumentation===\nIn [[virtual instrumentation]], actuators and sensors are the hardware complements of virtual instruments.\n\n== Performance metrics ==\nPerformance metrics for actuators include speed, acceleration, and force (alternatively, angular speed, angular acceleration, and torque), as well as [[Thermodynamic efficiency|energy efficiency]] and considerations such as mass, volume, operating conditions, and durability, among others.\n\n===Force===\nWhen considering force in actuators for applications, two main metrics should be considered. These two are static and dynamic loads. Static load is the force capability of the actuator while not in motion. Conversely, the dynamic load of the actuator is the force capability while in motion. The two aspects rarely have the same weight capability and must be considered separately.\n\n===Speed===\nSpeed should be considered primarily at a no-load pace, since the speed will invariably decrease as the load amount increases. The rate the speed will decrease will directly correlate with the amount of force and the initial speed.\n\n===Operating conditions===\nActuators are commonly rated using the standard [[IP Code]] rating system. Those that are rated for dangerous environments will have a higher IP rating than those for personal or common industrial use.\n\n===Durability===\nThis will be determined by each individual manufacturer, depending on usage and quality.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[End effector]]\n* [[Hard disk drive actuator]]\n* [[Linear actuator]]\n* [[Load cell]]\n* [[Microactuator]]\n* [[Nanotube nanomotor]]\n* [[Robotics#Actuation|Robot actuators]]\n* [[Torque motor]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Actuators]]"}]}}}}
