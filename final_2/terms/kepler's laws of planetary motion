Retrieved December 27, 2009.</ref>\n#The square of the [[orbital period]] of a planet is proportional to the cube of the [[semi-major axis]] of its orbit.\n\nMost planetary orbits are nearly circular, and careful observation and calculation are required in order to establish that they are not perfectly circular. Calculations of the orbit of [[Mars]], whose published values are somewhat suspect,<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/23/science/after-400-years-a-challenge-to-kepler-he-fabricated-his-data-scholar-says.html?pagewanted=1</ref> indicated an elliptical orbit. From this, [[Johannes Kepler]] inferred that other bodies in the [[Solar System]], including those farther away from the Sun, also have elliptical orbits.\n\nKepler's work (published between 1609 and 1619) improved the [[Copernican heliocentrism|heliocentric theory]] of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], explaining how the planets' speeds varied, and using elliptical orbits rather than circular orbits with [[epicycle]]s.<ref name=Holton/>\n\n[[Isaac Newton]] showed in 1687 that relationships like Kepler's would apply in the Solar System to a good approximation, as a consequence of his own [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]].\n\nKepler's laws are part of the foundation of modern [[astronomy]] and [[physics]].<ref name=smith-sep>See also G.

Zalta (ed.).</ref>\n\n==Comparison to Copernicus==\nKepler's laws improve the model of Copernicus. If the [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricities]] of the planetary [[orbit]]s are taken as zero, then Kepler basically agrees with Copernicus:\n#The planetary orbit is a circle\n#The Sun at the center of the orbit\n#The speed of the planet in the orbit is constant\n\nThe eccentricities of the orbits of those planets known to Copernicus and Kepler are small, so the foregoing rules give good approximations of planetary motion; but Kepler's laws fit the observations better than Copernicus'.\n\nKepler's corrections are not at all obvious:\n#The planetary orbit is ''not'' a circle, but an ''ellipse''.\n#The Sun is ''not'' at the center but at a ''focal point'' of the elliptical orbit.\n#Neither the linear speed nor the angular speed of the planet in the orbit is constant, but the ''area speed'' is constant.\n\nThe eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth makes the time from the [[March equinox]] to the [[September equinox]], around 186 days, unequal to the time from the September equinox to the March equinox, around 179 days. A diameter would cut the orbit into equal parts, but the plane through the Sun parallel to the [[equator]] of the Earth cuts the orbit into two parts with areas in a 186 to 179 ratio, so the eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth is approximately\n:<math>\\varepsilon\\approx\\frac \\pi 4 \\frac {186-179}{186+179}\\approx 0.015,</math>\nwhich is close to the correct value (0.016710219) (see [[Earth's orbit]]).\nThe calculation is correct when [[perihelion]], the date the Earth is closest to the Sun, falls on a [[solstice]]. The current perihelion, near January 4, is fairly close to the solstice of December 21 or 22.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nIt took nearly two centuries for the current formulation of Kepler's work to take on its settled form.

(1609), Kepler did not present his second law in its modern form.  He did that only in his ''Epitome'' of 1621.  Furthermore, in 1609, he presented his second law in two different forms, which scholars call the \"distance law\" and the \"area law\".\n*  His \"distance law\" is presented in:  ''\"Caput XXXII.  Virtutem quam Planetam movet in circulum attenuari cum discessu a fonte.\"'' (Chapter 32.  The force that moves a planet circularly weakens with distance from the source.)  See:  Johannes Kepler, ''Astronomia nova'' \u2026 (1609), [https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/164/mode/2up pp. 165\u2013167.]  [https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/166/mode/2up On page 167], Kepler states:  ''\" \u2026 , quanto longior est \u03b1\u03b4 quam \u03b1\u03b5, tanto diutius moratur Planeta in certo aliquo arcui excentrici apud \u03b4, quam in \u00e6quali arcu excentrici apud \u03b5.\"'' ( \u2026 , as \u03b1\u03b4 is longer than \u03b1\u03b5, so much longer will a planet remain on a certain arc of the eccentric near \u03b4 than on an equal arc of the eccentric near \u03b5.)  That is, the farther a planet is from the Sun (at the point \u03b1), the slower it moves along its orbit, so a radius from the Sun to a planet passes through equal areas in equal times.  However, as Kepler presented it, his argument is accurate only for circles, not ellipses.\n*  His \"area law\" is presented in:  ''\"Caput LIX.  Demonstratio, quod orbita Martis, \u2026 , fiat perfecta ellipsis: \u2026 \"'' (Chapter 59.  Proof that Mars' orbit, \u2026 , is a perfect ellipse: \u2026 ), Protheorema XIV and XV, [https://archive.org/stream/Astronomianovaa00Kepl#page/284/mode/2up pp. 291\u2013295.]  On the top p. 294, it reads:   ''\"Arcum ellipseos, cujus moras metitur area AKN, debere terminari in LK, ut sit AM.\"''  (The arc of the ellipse, of which the duration is delimited [i.e., measured] by the area AKM, should be terminated in LK, so that it [i.e., the arc] is AM.)  In other words, the time that Mars requires to move along an arc AM of its elliptical orbit is measured by the area of the segment AMN of the ellipse (where N is the position of the Sun), which in turn is proportional to the section AKN of the circle that encircles the ellipse and that is tangent to it.  Therefore, the area that is swept out by a radius from the Sun to Mars as Mars moves along an arc of its elliptical orbit is proportional to the time that Mars requires to move along that arc.  Thus, a radius from the Sun to Mars sweeps out equal areas in equal times.\nIn 1621, Kepler restated his second law for any planet:  Johannes Kepler, ''Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae'' [Summary of Copernican Astronomy] (Linz (\"Lentiis ad Danubium\"), (Austria):  Johann Planck, 1622), book 5, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wa2SE_6ZL7YC&pg=PA668#v=onepage&q&f=true page 668].  From page 668:  ''\"Dictum quidem est in superioribus, divisa orbita in particulas minutissimas \u00e6quales:  accrescete iis moras planet\u00e6 per eas, in proportione intervallorum inter eas & Solem.\"''  (It has been said above that, if the orbit of the planet is divided into the smallest equal parts, the times of the planet in them increase in the ratio of the distances between them and the sun.)  That is, a planet's speed along its orbit is inversely proportional to its distance from the Sun.  (The remainder of the paragraph makes clear that Kepler was referring to what is now called angular velocity.)</ref> Kepler's third law was published in 1619.<ref name = \"Kepler 1619\">Johannes Kepler, ''Harmonices Mundi'' [The Harmony of the World] (Linz, (Austria):  Johann Planck, 1619), book 5, chapter 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZLlCAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA189#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 189.]  From the bottom of p. 189:  ''\"Sed res est certissima exactissimaque quod ''proportio qua est inter binorum quorumcunque Planetarum tempora periodica, sit pr\u00e6cise sesquialtera proportionis'' mediarum distantiarum, \u2026 \"''  (But it is absolutely certain and exact that the ''proportion between the periodic times of any two planets is precisely the sesquialternate proportion'' [i.e., the ratio of 3:2] of their mean distances, \u2026 \")<br>\nAn English translation of Kepler's ''Harmonices Mundi'' is available as:  Johannes Kepler with E.J.

His first law reflected this discovery.\n\nKepler in 1621 and [[Godefroy Wendelin]] in 1643 noted that Kepler's third law applies to the four brightest moons of [[Jupiter]].<ref group=\"Nb\">Godefroy Wendelin wrote a letter to Giovanni Battista Riccioli about the relationship between the distances of the Jovian moons from Jupiter and the periods of their orbits, showing that the periods and distances conformed to Kepler's third law.

Here ''P'' is the time taken for a planet to complete an orbit round the sun, and ''a'' is the mean value between the maximum and minimum distances between the planet and sun (i.e. the semimajor axis).\n\nThe corresponding formula in Newtonian mechanics is\n:<math>\\frac{P^2}{a^3} = \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G(M+m)}\\approx \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{GM} = \\mathrm{constant}</math>\nwhere ''M'' is the mass of the sun, ''m'' is the mass of the planet, and ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]].\n\nAs the Sun is much heavier than any planet, Kepler's third law is approximately correct in Newtonian mechanics.\n\n==Planetary acceleration==\n[[Isaac Newton]] computed in his [[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] the [[acceleration]] of a planet moving according to Kepler's first and second law.\n#The ''direction'' of the acceleration is towards the Sun.\n#The ''magnitude'' of the acceleration is inversely proportional to the square of the planet's distance from the Sun (the ''inverse square law'').\n\nThis implies that the Sun may be the physical cause of the acceleration of planets.\n\nNewton defined the [[force]] acting on a planet to be the product of its [[mass]] and the acceleration (see [[Newton's laws of motion]]). So:\n#Every planet is attracted towards the Sun.\n#The force acting on a planet is in direct proportion to the mass of the planet and in inverse proportion to the square of its distance from the Sun.\n\nThe Sun plays an unsymmetrical part, which is unjustified. So he assumed, in [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]]:\n#All bodies in the solar system attract one another.\n#The force between two bodies is in direct proportion to the product of their masses and in inverse proportion to the square of the distance between them.\n\nAs the planets have small masses compared to that of the Sun, the orbits conform approximately to Kepler's laws. Newton's model improves upon Kepler's model, and fits actual observations more accurately (see [[two-body problem]]).\n\nBelow comes the detailed calculation of the acceleration of a planet moving according to Kepler's first and second laws.\n\n===Acceleration vector===\n{{See also| Polar coordinate#Vector calculus| Mechanics of planar particle motion}}\nFrom the [[heliocentric]] point of view consider the vector to the planet <math>\\mathbf{r} = r \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} </math> where <math> r</math> is the distance to the planet and <math> \\hat {\\mathbf{r}} </math> is a [[unit vector]] pointing towards the planet. \n:<math> \\frac{d\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}}{dt}=\\dot{\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}} = \\dot\\theta  \\hat{\\boldsymbol\\theta},\\qquad  \\frac{d\\hat{\\boldsymbol\\theta}}{dt}=\\dot{\\hat{\\boldsymbol\\theta}} = -\\dot\\theta \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}</math>\nwhere <math>\\hat{\\boldsymbol\\theta}</math> is the unit vector orthogonal to <math>\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}</math> and pointing in the direction of rotation, and <math>\\theta</math> is the polar angle, and where a [[Notation for differentiation#Newton.27s notation|dot]] on top of the variable signifies differentiation with respect to time.\n\nDifferentiate the position vector twice to obtain the velocity vector and the acceleration vector:\n:<math>\\dot{\\mathbf{r}} =\\dot{r} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} + r \\dot{\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}}\n=\\dot{r} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} + r \\dot{\\theta} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}},</math>\n:<math>\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}} \n= (\\ddot{r} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} +\\dot{r} \\dot{\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}} )\n+ (\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} + r\\ddot{\\theta} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\n+ r\\dot{\\theta} \\dot{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}})\n= (\\ddot{r} - r\\dot{\\theta}^2) \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} + (r\\ddot{\\theta} + 2\\dot{r} \\dot{\\theta}) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}.</math>\nSo\n:<math>\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}} = a_r \\hat{\\boldsymbol{r}}+a_\\theta\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}</math>\nwhere the '''radial acceleration''' is\n:<math>a_r=\\ddot{r} - r\\dot{\\theta}^2</math>\nand the '''transversal acceleration''' is\n:<math>a_\\theta=r\\ddot{\\theta} + 2\\dot{r} \\dot{\\theta}.</math>\n\n===The inverse square law===\nKepler's second law says that\n:<math>r^2\\dot \\theta = nab </math> \nis constant.\n\nThe transversal acceleration <math>a_\\theta</math> is zero:\n:<math>\\frac{d (r^2 \\dot \\theta)}{dt} = r (2 \\dot r \\dot \\theta + r \\ddot \\theta ) = r a_\\theta = 0. </math>\nSo the acceleration of a planet obeying Kepler's second law is directed towards the sun.\n\nThe radial acceleration <math>a_r  </math> is\n:<math>a_r = \\ddot r - r \\dot \\theta^2= \\ddot r - r \\left(\\frac{nab}{r^2}\n\\right)^2= \\ddot r -\\frac{n^2a^2b^2}{r^3}. </math>\nKepler's first law states that the orbit is described by the equation:\n:<math>\\frac{p}{r} = 1+ \\varepsilon \\cos\\theta.</math>\nDifferentiating with respect to time\n:<math>-\\frac{p\\dot r}{r^2} = -\\varepsilon  \\sin \\theta \\,\\dot \\theta </math>\nor\n:<math>p\\dot r = nab\\,\\varepsilon\\sin \\theta. </math>\nDifferentiating once more\n:<math>p\\ddot r =nab \\varepsilon \\cos \\theta \\,\\dot \\theta\n=nab \\varepsilon \\cos \\theta \\,\\frac{nab}{r^2}\n=\\frac{n^2a^2b^2}{r^2}\\varepsilon \\cos \\theta . </math>\nThe radial acceleration <math>a_r  </math> satisfies\n:<math>p a_r = \\frac{n^2 a^2b^2}{r^2}\\varepsilon \\cos \\theta  - p\\frac{n^2 a^2b^2}{r^3}\n= \\frac{n^2a^2b^2}{r^2}\\left(\\varepsilon \\cos \\theta - \\frac{p}{r}\\right). </math>\nSubstituting the equation of the ellipse gives\n:<math>p a_r = \\frac{n^2a^2b^2}{r^2}\\left(\\frac p r - 1 - \\frac p r\\right)= -\\frac{n^2a^2}{r^2}b^2. </math>\nThe relation <math>b^2=pa</math> gives the simple final result\n:<math>a_r=-\\frac{n^2a^3}{r^2}. </math>\nThis means that the acceleration vector <math>\\mathbf{\\ddot r}</math> of any planet obeying Kepler's first and second law satisfies the '''inverse square law'''\n:<math>\\mathbf{\\ddot r} = - \\frac{\\alpha}{r^2}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\\alpha = n^2 a^3\\,</math>\nis a constant, and <math>\\hat{\\mathbf r}</math> is the unit vector pointing from the Sun towards the planet, and <math>r\\,</math> is the distance between the planet and the Sun.\n\nAccording to Kepler's third law, <math>\\alpha</math> has the same value for all the planets. So the inverse square law for planetary accelerations applies throughout the entire solar system.\n\nThe inverse square law is a [[differential equation]]. The solutions to this differential equation include the Keplerian motions, as shown, but they also include motions where the orbit is a [[hyperbola]] or [[parabola]] or a [[straight line]]. See [[Kepler orbit]].\n\n===Newton's law of gravitation===\nBy [[Newton's second law]], the gravitational force that acts on the planet is:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = m_\\text{planet} \\mathbf{\\ddot r} = - m_\\text{planet} \\alpha r^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}</math>\n\nwhere <math>m_\\text{planet}</math> is the mass of the planet and <math>\\alpha</math> has the same value for all planets in the solar system. According to [[Newton's Third Law|Newton's third Law]], the Sun is attracted to the planet by a force of the same magnitude. Since the force is proportional to the mass of the planet, under the symmetric consideration, it should also be proportional to the mass of the Sun, <math>m_\\text{Sun}</math>. So\n\n:<math>\\alpha = Gm_\\text{Sun}</math>\n\nwhere <math>G</math> is the [[gravitational constant]].\n\nThe acceleration of solar system body number ''i'' is, according to Newton's laws:\n:<math>\\mathbf{\\ddot r_i} = G\\sum_{j\\ne i} m_j r_{ij}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{ij} </math>\nwhere <math>m_j </math> is the mass of body ''j'', <math>r_{ij} </math> is the distance between body ''i'' and body ''j'', <math>\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{ij} </math> is the unit vector from body ''i'' towards body ''j'', and the vector summation is over all bodies in the world, besides ''i'' itself.\n\nIn the special case where there are only two bodies in the world, Earth and Sun, the acceleration becomes\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{\\ddot r}_\\text{Earth} = G m_\\text{Sun} r_{\\text{Earth},\\text{Sun}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Earth},\\text{Sun}}</math>\n\nwhich is the acceleration of the Kepler motion. So this Earth moves around the Sun according to Kepler's laws.\n\nIf the two bodies in the world are Moon and Earth the acceleration of the Moon becomes\n:<math>\\mathbf{\\ddot r}_\\text{Moon} = G m_\\text{Earth} r_{\\text{Moon},\\text{Earth}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Moon},\\text{Earth}}</math>\nSo in this approximation the Moon moves around the Earth according to Kepler's laws.\n\nIn the three-body case the accelerations are\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{\\ddot r}_\\text{Sun} = G m_\\text{Earth} r_{\\text{Sun},\\text{Earth}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Sun},\\text{Earth}} + G m_\\text{Moon} r_{\\text{Sun},\\text{Moon}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Sun},\\text{Moon}}</math>\n:<math>\\mathbf{\\ddot r}_\\text{Earth} = G m_\\text{Sun} r_{\\text{Earth},\\text{Sun}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Earth},\\text{Sun}} + G m_\\text{Moon} r_{\\text{Earth},\\text{Moon}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Earth},\\text{Moon}} </math>\n:<math>\\mathbf{\\ddot r}_\\text{Moon} = G m_\\text{Sun} r_{\\text{Moon},\\text{Sun}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Moon},\\text{Sun}}+ G m_\\text{Earth} r_{\\text{Moon},\\text{Earth}}^{-2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{\\text{Moon},\\text{Earth}}</math>\n\nThese accelerations are not those of Kepler orbits, and the [[three-body problem]] is complicated. But Keplerian approximation is the basis for [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]] calculations. See [[Lunar theory]].\n\n==Position as a function of time {{anchor|position_function_time}}==\nKepler used his two first laws to compute the position of a planet as a function of time. His method involves the solution of a [[Transcendental function|transcendental equation]] called [[Kepler's equation]].\n\nThe procedure for calculating the heliocentric polar coordinates (''r'',''\u03b8'') of a planet as a function of the time ''t'' since [[perihelion]], is the following four steps:\n\n:1. Compute the '''[[mean anomaly]]''' ''M''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''nt'' where ''n'' is the [[mean motion]].\n::<math>n\\cdot P=2\\pi</math> radians where ''P'' is the period.\n:2.

Because the uniform circular motion was considered to be ''normal'', a deviation from this motion was considered an '''anomaly'''.\n\nThe proof of this procedure is shown below.\n\n===Mean anomaly, ''M''===\n[[File:Mean Anomaly.svg|thumb|200px| FIgure 5: Geometric construction for Kepler's calculation of \u03b8.
