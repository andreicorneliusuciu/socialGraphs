The rate of [[heat]] transfer  is dependent on the temperatures of the systems and the properties of the intervening medium through which the heat is transferred. The three fundamental modes of heat transfer are ''[[Thermal conduction|conduction]]'', ''[[convection]]'' and ''[[radiation]]''. Heat transfer, the flow of energy in the form of heat, is a process by which a system's [[internal energy]] is changed, hence is of vital use in applications of the [[First Law of Thermodynamics]]. Conduction is also known as diffusion, not to be confused with [[diffusion]] related to the mixing of constituents of a fluid.\n\nThe direction of heat transfer is from a region of high temperature to another region of lower temperature, and is governed by the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]]. Heat transfer changes the [[internal energy]] of the systems from which and to which the energy is transferred.  Heat transfer will occur in a direction that increases the entropy of the collection of systems.\n\nHeat transfer ceases when [[thermal equilibrium]] is reached, at which point all involved bodies and the surroundings reach the same temperature.  [[Thermal expansion]] OR [[Thermal contraction]] is the tendency of matter to change in [[volume]] in response to a change in [[temperature]].<ref name=\"Tipler\">\n{{Cite book | last = Paul A. | first = Tipler |author2=Gene Mosca\n| title = Physics for Scientists and Engineers, Volume 1 |edition=6th\n| publisher = Worth Publishers | year = 2008 | location = New York, NY | pages = 666\u2013670\n| url = https://books.google.com/?id=BMVR37-8Jh0C&pg=PA668\n| isbn = 1-4292-0132-0}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n{{See also |Heat transfer physics}}\n[[File:Erbe.gif|thumb|300px|Earth's longwave thermal [[Earth's energy budget#Outgoing energy|radiation]] intensity, from clouds, atmosphere and surface.]]\n[[Heat]] is defined in physics as the transfer of [[thermal energy]] across a well-defined boundary around a [[thermodynamic system]]. The [[thermodynamic free energy]] is the amount of work that a thermodynamic system can perform. [[Enthalpy]] is a [[thermodynamic potential]], designated by the letter \"H\", that is the sum of the [[internal energy]] of the system (U) plus the product of [[pressure]] (P) and [[volume]] (V). [[Joule]] is a unit to quantify energy, work, or the amount of heat.\n\nHeat transfer is a. [[process function]] (or path function), as opposed to [[functions of state]]; therefore, the amount of heat transferred in a [[thermodynamic process]] that changes the [[thermodynamic state|state]] of a [[thermodynamic system|system]] depends on how that process occurs, not only the net difference between the initial and final states of the process.\n\nThermodynamic and [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]] heat transfer is calculated with the [[heat transfer coefficient]], the [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] between the [[heat flux]] and the thermodynamic driving force for the flow of heat.

In other words, heat is transferred by conduction when adjacent atoms vibrate against one another, or as electrons move from one atom to another. Conduction is the most significant means of heat transfer within a solid or between solid objects in [[thermal contact]]. Fluids\u2014especially gases\u2014are less conductive. [[Thermal contact conductance]] is the study of heat conduction between solid bodies in contact.<ref name=Abbott>{{cite book|last=Abbott|first=J.M. Smith, H.C.

Analysis of transient  systems is more complex and often calls for the application of approximation theories or numerical analysis by computer.<ref name=\"Abbott\"/>\n\n===Convection===\n{{main|Convection}}\nThe flow of fluid may be forced by external processes, or sometimes (in gravitational fields) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the fluid (for example in a fire plume), thus influencing its own transfer. The latter process is often called \"natural convection\". All convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion, as well. Another form of convection is forced convection. In this case the fluid is forced to flow by use of a pump, fan or other mechanical means.\n\n[[Convective heat transfer]], or convection, is the transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement of [[fluids]], a process that is essentially the transfer of heat via [[mass transfer]]. Bulk motion of fluid enhances heat transfer in many physical situations, such as (for example) between a solid surface and the fluid.<ref>{{cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nrbfpSZTwskC\n| title = Heat Transfer: a practical approach\n| last = \u00c7engel\n| first = Yunus\n\n| edition = 2nd\n| publisher = McGraw-Hill\n| location = Boston\n| year = 2003\n| isbn = 978-0-07-245893-0\n| series = McGraw-Hill series in mechanical engineering.\n| accessdate = 2009-04-20\n| oclc = 300472921\n}}</ref>\nConvection is usually the dominant form of heat transfer in liquids and gases. Although sometimes discussed as a third method of heat transfer, convection is usually used to describe the combined effects of heat conduction within the fluid (diffusion) and heat transference by bulk fluid flow streaming.<ref>[https://www.thermalfluidscentral.org/encyclopedia/index.php/Convective_Heat_Transfer \"Thermal-FluidsPedia | Convective heat transfer\"]</ref> The process of transport by fluid streaming is known as advection, but pure advection is a term that is generally associated only with mass transport in fluids, such as advection of pebbles in a river. In the case of heat transfer in fluids, where transport by advection in a fluid is always also accompanied by transport via heat diffusion (also known as heat conduction) the process of heat convection is understood to refer to the sum of heat transport by advection and diffusion/conduction.\n\nFree, or natural, convection occurs when bulk fluid motions (streams and currents) are caused by buoyancy forces that result from density variations due to variations of temperature in the fluid. ''Forced'' convection is a term used when the streams and currents in the fluid are induced by external means\u2014such as fans, stirrers, and pumps\u2014creating an artificially induced convection current.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.engineersedge.com/heat_transfer/convection.htm\n| title = Convection \u2014 Heat Transfer\n| work = Engineers Edge\n| publisher = Engineers Edge\n| accessdate = 2009-04-20\n}}</ref>\n\n==== Convection-cooling ====\n{{See also |Nusselt number}}\nConvective cooling is sometimes described as [[Convective heat transfer#Newton's law of cooling|Newton's law of cooling]]: \n{{Quotation|''The rate of heat loss of a body is proportional to the temperature difference between the body and its surroundings''.}} However, by definition, the validity of Newton's law of cooling requires that the rate of heat loss from convection be a linear function of (\"proportional to\") the temperature difference that drives heat transfer, and in convective cooling this is sometimes not the case. In general, convection is not linearly dependent on temperature gradients, and in some cases is strongly nonlinear. In these cases, Newton's law does not apply.\n\n===Convection vs. conduction===\nIn a body of fluid that is heated from underneath its container, conduction and convection can be considered to compete for dominance. If heat conduction is too great, fluid moving down by convection is heated by conduction so fast that its downward movement will be stopped due to its [[buoyancy]], while fluid moving up by convection is cooled by conduction so fast that its driving buoyancy will diminish. On the other hand, if heat conduction is very low, a large temperature gradient may be formed and convection might be very strong.\n\nThe [[Rayleigh number]] (<math>Ra </math>) is a measure determining the relative strength of conduction and convection.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n:<math> Ra = \\frac{g \\Delta \\rho L^3} {\\mu \\alpha} = \\frac{g \\beta \\Delta T L^3} {\\nu \\alpha}</math>\n\nwhere\n*''g'' is acceleration due to gravity,\n*\u03c1 is the density with <math>\\Delta \\rho</math> being the density difference between the lower and upper ends,\n*\u03bc is the [[dynamic viscosity]],\n*\u03b1 is the [[Thermal diffusivity]],\n*\u03b2 is the volume [[thermal expansivity]] (sometimes denoted ''\u03b1'' elsewhere),\n*''T'' is the temperature, \n*\u03bd is the [[kinematic viscosity]], and\n*''L'' is characteristic length.\n\nThe Rayleigh number can be understood as the ratio between the rate of heat transfer by convection to the rate of heat transfer by conduction; or, equivalently, the ratio between the corresponding timescales (i.e. conduction timescale divided by convection timescale), up to a numerical factor. This can be seen as follows, where all calculations are up to numerical factors depending on the geometry of the system.\n\nThe buoyancy force driving the convection is roughly <math>g \\Delta \\rho L^3</math>, so the corresponding pressure is roughly <math>g \\Delta \\rho L </math>. In [[steady state]], this is canceled by the shear stress due to viscosity, and therefore roughly equals <math>\\mu V/L =  \\mu /T_{conv} </math>, where ''V'' is the typical fluid velocity due to convection and <math>T_{conv}</math> the order of its timescale.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The conduction timescale, on the other hand, is of the order of <math>T_{cond} = L^2/ \\alpha</math>.\n\nConvection occurs when the Rayleigh number is above 1,000\u20132,000.\n\n===Radiation===\n[[File:Hot metalwork.jpg|thumb|left|Red-hot iron object, transferring heat to the surrounding environment primarily through thermal radiation]]\n[[Thermal radiation]] occurs through a [[vacuum]] or any [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] [[Optical medium|medium]] ([[solid]] or [[fluid]]).

[[Anthropogenic]] perturbations in the climate system are responsible for a positive [[radiative forcing]] which reduces the net longwave radiation loss to [[space]].\n\n[[Thermal radiation]] is energy emitted by matter as electromagnetic waves, due to the pool of [[thermal energy]] in all matter with a temperature above [[absolute zero]]. Thermal radiation propagates without the presence of matter through the [[vacuum]] of space.<ref>[https://www.thermalfluidscentral.org/encyclopedia/index.php/Radiation \"Thermal-FluidsPedia | Radiation\"]</ref>\n\nThermal radiation is a direct result of the random movements of atoms and molecules in matter. Since these atoms and molecules are composed of charged particles ([[proton]]s and [[electron]]s), their movement results in the emission of [[electromagnetic radiation]], which carries energy away from the surface.\n\nThe [[Stefan-Boltzmann equation]], which describes the rate of transfer of radiant energy, is as follows for an object in a vacuum :\n\n:<math> Q= \\epsilon \\sigma T^4 </math>\n\nFor radiative transfer between two objects, the equation is as follows:\n\n:<math> Q= \\epsilon \\sigma (T_a^4-T_b^4) </math>\n\nwhere Q is the heat flux, \u03b5 is the [[emissivity]] (unity for a [[black body]]), \u03c3 is the [[Stefan-Boltzmann constant]], and T is the absolute temperature (in Kelvin or Rankine).

The saturation temperature is the temperature for a corresponding saturation pressure at which a liquid boils into its vapor phase. The liquid can be said to be saturated with thermal energy. Any addition of thermal energy results in a phase transition.\n\nAt standard atmospheric pressure and '''low temperatures''', no boiling occurs and the heat transfer rate is controlled by the usual single-phase mechanisms. As the surface temperature is increased, local boiling occurs and vapor bubbles nucleate, grow into the surrounding cooler fluid, and collapse. This is ''sub-cooled nucleate boiling'', and is a very efficient heat transfer mechanism. At high bubble generation rates, the bubbles begin to interfere and the heat flux no longer increases rapidly with surface temperature (this is the [[Nucleate boiling#Departure from nucleate boiling|departure from nucleate boiling]], or DNB).\n\nAt similar standard atmospheric pressure and '''high temperatures''', the hydrodynamically-quieter regime of [[Boiling#Film|film boiling]] is reached. Heat fluxes across the stable vapor layers are low, but rise slowly with temperature. Any contact between fluid and the surface that may be seen probably leads to the extremely rapid nucleation of a fresh vapor layer (\"spontaneous [[nucleation]]\"). At higher temperatures still, a maximum in the heat flux is reached (the [[critical heat flux]], or CHF).\n\nThe [[Leidenfrost Effect]] demonstrates how nucleate boiling slows heat transfer due to gas bubbles on the heater's surface. As mentioned, gas-phase thermal conductivity is much lower than liquid-phase thermal conductivity, so the outcome is a kind of \"gas thermal barrier\".\n\n===Condensation===\n{{main|Condensation}}\nCondensation occurs when a vapor is cooled and changes its phase to a liquid.  During condensation, the [[latent heat of vaporization]] must be released. The amount of the heat is the same as that absorbed during vaporization at the same fluid pressure.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nThere are several types of condensation:\n* Homogeneous condensation, as during a formation of fog.\n* Condensation in direct contact with subcooled liquid.\n* Condensation on direct contact with a cooling wall of a heat exchanger: This is the most common mode used in industry:\n** Filmwise condensation is when a liquid film is formed on the subcooled surface, and usually occurs when the liquid wets the surface.\n** Dropwise condensation is when liquid drops are formed on the subcooled surface, and usually occurs when the liquid does not wet the surface.\n:Dropwise condensation is difficult to sustain reliably; therefore, industrial equipment is normally designed to operate in filmwise condensation mode.\n\n=== Melting ===\n{{main|Melting}}\n[[File:Melting icecubes.gif|thumb|Ice melting]]\nMelting is a physical process that results in the phase transition of a substance from a [[solid]] to a [[liquid]]. The [[internal energy]] of a substance is increased, typically by the application of heat or pressure, resulting in a rise of its temperature to the [[melting point]], at which the ordering of ionic or molecular entities in the solid breaks down to a less ordered state and the solid liquefies. An object that has melted completely is molten. Substances in the molten state generally have reduced viscosity with elevated temperature; an exception to this maxim is the element [[sulfur]], whose viscosity increases to a point due to [[polymerization]] and then decreases with higher temperatures in its molten state.<ref>C.Michael Hogan (2011) ''Sulfur'', Encyclopedia of Earth, eds.

This is a method of approximation that reduces one aspect of the transient conduction system\u2014that within the object\u2014to an equivalent steady state system. That is, the method assumes that the temperature within the object is completely uniform, although its value may be changing in time.\n\nIn this method, the ratio of the conductive heat resistance within the object to the convective heat transfer resistance across the object's boundary, known as the ''[[Biot number]]'', is calculated. For small Biot numbers, the approximation of ''spatially uniform temperature within the object'' can be used: it can be presumed that heat transferred into the object has time to uniformly distribute itself, due to the lower resistance to doing so, as compared with the resistance to heat entering the object.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n==Engineering==\n[[File:Nelson tulsa test.jpg|thumb|right|Heat exposure as part of a fire test for firestop products]]\nHeat transfer has broad application to the functioning of numerous devices and systems.

[[Thermal resistance]] is a heat property and the measurement by which an object or material resists to heat flow (heat per time unit or thermal resistance) to temperature difference.\n\n[[Radiance]] or spectral radiance are measures of the quantity of radiation that passes through or is emitted. [[Radiant barrier]]s are materials that [[Reflection (physics)|reflect]] radiation, and therefore reduce the flow of heat from radiation sources.  Good insulators are not necessarily good radiant barriers, and vice versa.  Metal, for instance, is an excellent reflector and a poor insulator.\n\nThe effectiveness of a radiant barrier is indicated by its '''reflectivity''', which is the fraction of radiation reflected.  A material with a high reflectivity (at a given wavelength) has a low emissivity (at that same wavelength), and vice versa. At any specific wavelength, reflectivity = 1 - emissivity.  An ideal radiant barrier would have a reflectivity of 1, and would therefore reflect 100 percent of incoming radiation. [[Vacuum flasks]], or Dewars, are [[silvered]] to approach this ideal. In  the vacuum of space, satellites use [[multi-layer insulation]], which consists of many layers of aluminized (shiny) [[Mylar]] to greatly reduce radiation heat transfer and control satellite temperature.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n===Devices===\n[[Image:heat engine.png|300px|thumb|right|Heat engine diagram]]\n* [[Heat engine]] is a system that performs the conversion of heat or [[thermal energy]] to [[mechanical energy]] which can then be used to do [[mechanical work]].<ref>''Fundamentals of Classical Thermodynamics'', 3rd ed. p. 159, (1985) by G.

In parallel flow, both fluids move in the same direction while transferring heat; in counter flow, the fluids move in opposite directions; and in cross flow, the fluids move at [[right angle]]s to each other.  Common constructions for heat exchanger include shell and tube, [[Heat exchanger#Double pipe heat exchanger|double pipe]], extruded finned pipe, spiral fin pipe, u-tube, and stacked plate.{{Elucidate|date=November 2010}}\n\nA [[heat sink]] is a component that transfers heat generated within a solid material to a fluid medium, such as air or a liquid. Examples of heat sinks are the heat exchangers used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems or the radiator in a car. A [[heat pipe]] is another heat-transfer device that combines thermal conductivity and phase transition to efficiently transfer heat between two solid interfaces.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Architecture===\n[[Efficient energy use]] is the goal to reduce the amount of energy required in heating or cooling. In architecture, condensation and [[air current]]s can cause cosmetic or structural damage. An [[energy audit]] can help to assess the implementation of recommended corrective procedures. For instance, insulation improvements, air sealing of structural leaks or the addition of energy-efficient windows and doors.<ref>{{cite web|title=EnergySavers: Tips on Saving Money & Energy at Home|url=http://www.energysavers.gov/pdfs/energy_savers.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=March 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\n* [[Smart meter]] is a device that records electric energy consumption in intervals.  \n* [[Thermal transmittance]] is the rate of transfer of heat through a structure divided by the difference in temperature across the structure. It is expressed in watts per square meter per kelvin, or W/m\u00b2K. Well-insulated parts of a building have a low thermal transmittance, whereas poorly-insulated parts of a building have a high thermal transmittance.\n* [[Thermostat]] is a device to monitor and control temperature.\n\n===Climate engineering===\n{{See also |Anthropogenic heat}}\n[[File:Biochar.jpg|thumb|300px|An example application in climate engineering includes the creation of [[Biochar]] through the [[pyrolysis]] process. Thus, storing greenhouse gases in carbon reduces the radiative forcing capacity in the atmosphere, causing more long-wave ([[infrared]]) radiation out to Space.]]\n[[Climate engineering]] consists of [[carbon dioxide removal]] and [[solar radiation management]]. Since the amount of [[carbon dioxide]] determines the [[radiative balance]] of Earth atmosphere, carbon dioxide removal techniques can be applied to reduce the [[radiative forcing]]. Solar radiation management is the attempt to absorb less solar radiation to offset the effects of [[greenhouse gases]].\n\n===Greenhouse effect===\n[[File:The green house effect.svg|300px|thumb|A representation of the exchanges of energy between the source (the [[Sun]]), the Earth's surface, the [[Earth's atmosphere]], and the ultimate sink [[outer space]]. The ability of the atmosphere to capture and recycle energy emitted by the Earth surface is the defining characteristic of the greenhouse effect.]]\nThe [[greenhouse effect]] is a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary surface is absorbed by atmospheric greenhouse gases, and is re-radiated in all directions. Since part of this re-radiation is back towards the surface and the lower atmosphere, it results in an elevation of the average surface temperature above what it would be in the absence of the gases.\n\n===Heat transfer in the human body===\n{{See also |Wet-bulb temperature}}\nThe principles of heat transfer in engineering systems can be applied to the human body in order to determine how the body transfers heat. Heat is produced in the body by the continuous metabolism of nutrients which provides energy for the systems of the body.<ref>Hartman,Carl and Bibb, Lewis. \"The Human body and its enemies: a textbook of physiology hygiene and sanitation\", World Book Co., 1913, p.232.</ref> The human body must maintain a consistent internal temperature in order to maintain healthy bodily functions. Therefore, excess heat must be dissipated from the body to keep it from overheating. When a person engages in elevated levels of physical activity, the body requires additional fuel which increases the metabolic rate and the rate of heat production. The body must then use additional methods to remove the additional heat produced in order to keep the internal temperature at a healthy level.\n\n[[Convective heat transfer|Heat transfer by convection]] is driven by the movement of fluids over the surface of the body. This convective fluid can be either a liquid or a gas. For heat transfer from the outer surface of the body, the convection mechanism is dependent on the surface area of the body, the velocity of the air, and the temperature gradient between the surface of the skin and the ambient air.<ref name=\"Cengel, Yunus A 2010\">Cengel, Yunus A. and Ghajar, Afshin J. \"Heat and Mass Transfer: Fundamentals and Applications.\" , McGraw-Hill, 4th Edition, 2010.</ref> The normal temperature of the body is approximately 37&nbsp;\u00b0C. Heat transfer occurs more readily when the temperature of the surroundings is significantly less than the normal body temperature. This concept explains why a person feels \u201ccold\u201d when not enough covering is worn when exposed to a cold environment. Clothing can be considered an insulator which provides thermal resistance to heat flow over the covered portion of the body.<ref>Tao, Xiaoming. \"Smart fibres, fabrics, and clothing\" , Woodhead Publishing, 2001</ref> This thermal resistance causes the temperature on the surface of the clothing to be less than the temperature on the surface of the skin. This smaller temperature gradient between the surface temperature and the ambient temperature will cause a lower rate of heat transfer than if the skin were not covered.\n\nIn order to ensure that one portion of the body is not significantly hotter than another portion, heat must be distributed evenly through the bodily tissues. Blood flowing through blood vessels acts as a convective fluid and helps to prevent any buildup of excess heat inside the tissues of the body. This flow of blood through the vessels can be modeled as pipe flow in an engineering system. The heat carried by the blood is determined by the temperature of the surrounding tissue, the diameter of the blood vessel, the [[Viscosity|thickness of the fluid]], velocity of the flow, and the heat transfer coefficient of the blood. The velocity, blood vessel diameter, and the fluid thickness can all be related with the [[Reynolds Number]], a dimensionless number used in fluid mechanics to characterize the flow of fluids.\n\n[[Latent heat]] loss, also known as evaporative heat loss, accounts for a large fraction of heat loss from the body. When the core temperature of the body increases, the body triggers sweat glands in the skin to bring additional moisture to the surface of the skin. The liquid is then transformed into vapor which removes heat from the surface of the body.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wilmore | first1 = Jack H. | last2 = Costill | first2 = David L. | last3 = Kenney | first3 = Larry | year = | title = Physiology of sport and exercise | url = | journal = Human Kinetics | volume = 2008 | issue = | page = 256 }}</ref> The rate of evaporation heat loss is directly related to the vapor pressure at the skin surface and the amount of moisture present on the skin.<ref name=\"Cengel, Yunus A 2010\"/> Therefore, the maximum of heat transfer will occur when the skin is completely wet. The body continuously loses water by evaporation but the most significant amount of heat loss occurs during periods of increased physical activity.\n\n===Cooling techniques===\n\n====Evaporative cooling====\n[[File:Air cooler.jpg|right|thumbnail|A traditional air cooler in [[Mirzapur]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]]]\n[[Evaporative cooling]] happens when water vapor is added to the surrounding air. The energy needed to evaporate the water is taken from the air in the form of sensible heat and converted into latent heat, while the air remains at a constant [[enthalpy]]. Latent heat describes the amount of heat that is needed to evaporate the liquid; this heat comes from the liquid itself and the surrounding gas and surfaces. The greater the difference between the two temperatures, the greater the evaporative cooling effect. When the temperatures are the same, no net evaporation of water in air occurs; thus, there is no cooling effect.\n\n====Laser cooling====\nIn [[Quantum Physics]] [[laser cooling]] is used to achieve temperatures of near [[absolute zero]] (\u2212273.15&nbsp;\u00b0C, \u2212459.67&nbsp;\u00b0F) of atomic and molecular samples, to observe unique [[quantum effects]] that can only occur at this heat level.\n\n* [[Doppler cooling]] is the most common method of laser cooling. \n* [[Sympathetic cooling]] is a process in which particles of one type cool particles of another type. Typically, atomic ions that can be directly laser-cooled are used to cool nearby ions or atoms. This technique allows cooling of ions and atoms that cannot be laser cooled directly.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n====Magnetic cooling====\n{{main|Magnetic refrigeration|Magnetic evaporative cooling}}\n[[Magnetic evaporative cooling]] is a process for lowering the temperature of a group of atoms, after pre-cooled by methods such as laser cooling. Magnetic refrigeration cools below 0.3K, by making use of the [[Magnetic refrigeration#The magnetocaloric effect|magnetocaloric effect]].\n\n====Radiative cooling====\n[[Radiative cooling]] is the process by which a body loses heat by radiation. [[Earth's energy budget#Outgoing energy|Outgoing]] energy is an important effect in the [[Earth's energy budget#Outgoing energy|Earth's energy budget]]. In the case of the Earth-atmosphere system, it refers to the process by which long-wave (infrared) radiation is emitted to balance the absorption of short-wave (visible) energy from the Sun. Convective transport of heat and evaporative transport of latent heat both remove heat from the surface and redistribute it in the atmosphere.\n\n===Thermal energy storage===\n[[Thermal energy storage]] refers to technologies used to collect and [[Energy storage|store energy]] for later use. They can be employed to balance energy demand between day and nighttime. The thermal reservoir may be maintained at a temperature above (hotter) or below (colder) than that of the ambient environment. Applications include later use in space heating, domestic or process hot water, or to generate electricity.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Combined forced and natural convection]]\n*[[Heat capacity]]\n*[[Heat transfer physics]]\n*[[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law]]\n*[[Thermal contact conductance]]\n*[[Thermal physics]]\n*[[Thermal resistance in electronics]]\n*[[Thermal science]]\n*[[Heat transfer enhancement]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://ahtt.mit.edu A Heat Transfer Textbook] - (free download).\n*[https://www.thermalfluidscentral.org/encyclopedia/index.php/Main_Page Thermal-FluidsPedia] - An online thermal fluids encyclopedia.\n*[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/heatra.html Hyperphysics Article on Heat Transfer] - Overview\n*[http://www.icax.co.uk/thermalbank.html Interseasonal Heat Transfer] - a practical example of how heat transfer is used to heat buildings without burning fossil fuels.\n*[http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/2007/HT/heat_transfer.html Aspects of Heat Transfer, Cambridge University]\n*[https://www.thermalfluidscentral.org/ Thermal-Fluids Central]\n*[http://energy.concord.org/energy2d/ Energy2D: Interactive Heat Transfer Simulations for Everyone]\n\n{{Chemical engg}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Heat Transfer}}\n[[Category:Chemical engineering]]\n[[Category:Unit operations]]\n[[Category:Transport phenomena]]\n[[Category:Heat transfer| ]]"}]}}}}
