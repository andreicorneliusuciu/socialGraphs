It is one of the seven base units in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) and is assigned the unit symbol '''K'''. The '''Kelvin scale''' is an absolute, [[thermodynamic temperature]] [[Scale of temperature|scale]] using as its null point [[absolute zero]], the temperature at which all [[Kinetic theory of gases|thermal motion]] ceases in the classical description of [[thermodynamics]]. The kelvin is defined as the fraction {{frac|273.16}} of the thermodynamic temperature of the [[Triple point#Triple points of water|triple point of water]] (exactly 0.01&nbsp;\u00b0C or 32.018&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref name=res413>{{cite web |title=Resolution 4: Definition of the SI unit of thermodynamic temperature (kelvin) |work=Resolutions of the 13th CGPM |url=http://www.bipm.fr/en/CGPM/db/13/4/ |publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures |year=1967 |accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref> In other words, it is defined such that the [[triple point]] of water is exactly 273.16&nbsp;K.\n\nThe Kelvin scale is named after the Belfast-born, [[Glasgow University]] engineer and physicist [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Lord Kelvin]] (1824\u20131907), who wrote of the need for an \"absolute thermometric scale\". Unlike the degree [[Fahrenheit]] and degree [[Celsius]], the kelvin is not referred to or typeset as a degree. The kelvin is the primary unit of temperature measurement in the physical sciences, but is often used in conjunction with the Celsius degree, which has the same magnitude. The definition implies that absolute zero (0&nbsp;K) is equivalent to {{convert|-273.15|C|F}}.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Thermodynamic temperature#History}}\n[[File:Lord Kelvin photograph.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]], the namesake of the unit]]\nIn 1848, Lord Kelvin wrote in his paper, ''On an Absolute Thermometric Scale'', of the need for a scale whereby \"infinite cold\" (absolute zero) was the scale's null point, and which used the degree Celsius for its unit increment. Kelvin calculated that absolute zero was equivalent to \u2212273&nbsp;\u00b0C on the air thermometers of the time.<ref name=lordkelvin>{{cite journal |last=Lord Kelvin|first=William |title=On an Absolute Thermometric Scale |journal=Philosophical Magazine |date=October 1848 |url=http://zapatopi.net/kelvin/papers/on_an_absolute_thermometric_scale.html |accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref> This absolute scale is known today as the Kelvin thermodynamic temperature scale. Kelvin's value of \"\u2212273\" was the negative reciprocal of 0.00366\u2014the accepted expansion coefficient of gas per degree Celsius relative to the ice point, giving a remarkable consistency to the currently accepted value.\n\nIn 1954, Resolution 3 of the 10th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) gave the Kelvin scale its modern definition by designating the [[triple point of water]] as its second defining point and assigned its temperature to exactly 273.16 kelvins.<ref name=res310>{{cite web |title=Resolution 3: Definition of the thermodynamic temperature scale |work=Resolutions of the 10th CGPM |publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures |url=http://www.bipm.fr/en/CGPM/db/10/3/ |year=1954 |accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967/1968  Resolution 3 of the 13th CGPM renamed the unit increment of thermodynamic temperature \"kelvin\", symbol K, replacing \"degree Kelvin\", symbol \u00b0K.<ref name=res313/> Furthermore, feeling it useful to more explicitly define the magnitude of the unit increment, the 13th CGPM also held in Resolution 4 that \"The kelvin, unit of thermodynamic temperature, is equal to the fraction {{frac|273.16}} of the thermodynamic temperature of the [[triple point of water]].\"<ref name=\"res413\"/>\n\nIn 2005  [[International Committee for Weights and Measures|The Comit\u00e9 International des Poids et Mesures]] (CIPM), a committee of the CGPM, affirmed that for the purposes of delineating the temperature of the triple point of water, the definition of the Kelvin thermodynamic temperature scale would refer to water having an isotopic composition specified as [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water|VSMOW]].<ref name=sib2115>{{cite web |title=Unit of thermodynamic temperature (kelvin) |work=SI Brochure, 8th edition |pages=Section 2.1.1.5 |url=http://www1.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/2-1-1/kelvin.html |publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures |year=1967 |accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref>\n\n==Usage conventions==\nWhen spelled out or spoken, the unit is pluralised using the same grammatical rules as for other [[International System of Units#Writing the unit names|SI units]] such as the [[volt]] or [[ohm]] (e.g. \"the triple point of water is exactly 273.16 kelvins\"<ref name=sib211>{{cite web |title=Rules and style conventions for expressing values of quantities |work=SI Brochure, 8th edition |pages=Section 2.1.1.5 |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/kelvin.html |publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures |year=1967 |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref>).

As with most other SI unit symbols (angle symbols, e.g. 45\u00b03\u20324\u2033, are the exception) there is a space between the numeric value and the kelvin symbol (e.g. \"99.987&nbsp;K\").<ref name=nist>{{cite web |title=SI Unit rules and style conventions |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/checklist.html |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |date=September 2004 |accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref><ref name=sib533>{{cite web |title=Rules and style conventions for expressing values of quantities |work=SI Brochure, 8th edition |pages=Section 5.3.3 |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/section5-3.html |publisher=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures |year=1967 |accessdate=2015-12-13}}</ref>\n\nBefore the 13th CGPM in 1967\u20131968, the unit kelvin was called a \"degree\", the same as with the other temperature scales at the time. It was distinguished from the other scales with either the adjective suffix \"Kelvin\" (\"degree Kelvin\") or with \"absolute\" (\"degree absolute\") and its symbol was \u00b0K. The latter term (degree absolute), which was the unit's official name from 1948 until 1954, was ambiguous since it could also be interpreted as referring to the [[Rankine scale]]. Before the 13th CGPM, the plural form was \"degrees absolute\". The 13th CGPM changed the unit name to simply \"kelvin\" (symbol K).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barry N.

Colour temperature is based upon the principle that a [[black body]] radiator emits light whose colour depends on the temperature of the radiator. Black bodies with temperatures below about {{val|4000|u=K}} appear reddish whereas those above about {{val|7500|u=K}} appear bluish. Colour temperature is important in the fields of image projection and [[photography]] where a colour temperature of approximately {{val|5600|u=K}} is required to match \"daylight\" film emulsions. In [[astronomy]], the [[stellar classification]] of stars and their place on the [[Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram]] are based, in part, upon their surface temperature, known as [[effective temperature]]. The photosphere of the [[Sun]], for instance, has an effective temperature of {{val|5778|u=K}}.\n\nDigital cameras and photographic software often use colour temperature in K in edit and setup menus. The simple guide is that the higher the 'colour temperature' in K then the more white or blue the image will be. The reduction in kelvin will give an image more dominated by reddish, warmer colours.\n\n===Kelvin as a measure of noise===\n{{main|Noise figure}}\nIn electronics, the kelvin is used as an indicator of how [[electronic noise|noisy]] a circuit is in relation to an ultimate [[noise floor]], i.e. the [[noise temperature]]. The so-called [[Johnson\u2013Nyquist noise]] of discrete resistors and capacitors is a type of thermal noise derived from the [[Boltzmann constant]] and can be used to determine the noise temperature of a circuit using the [[Friis formulas for noise]].\n\n== Unicode character ==\nThe symbol is encoded in [[Unicode]] at codepoint {{unichar|212A|kelvin sign}}.
