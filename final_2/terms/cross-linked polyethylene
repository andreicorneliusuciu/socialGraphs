It is formed into tubing, and is used predominantly in [[building services]] pipework systems, hydronic radiant heating and cooling systems, domestic water piping, and [[electrical insulation|insulation]] for high tension (high voltage) electrical cables. It is also used for [[natural gas]] and offshore [[petroleum|oil]] applications, chemical transportation, and transportation of [[sewage]] and [[slurries]].  PEX has become a common alternative to [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), [[chlorinated polyvinyl chloride]] (CPVC) or [[copper]] tubing for use as residential [[water pipe]]s.\n\n== Properties ==\nAlmost all PEX used for pipe and tubing is made from [[high-density polyethylene]] (HDPE). PEX contains cross-linked bonds in the [[polymer]] structure, changing the [[thermoplastic]] to a [[thermoset]]. Cross-linking is accomplished during or after the [[extrusion]] of the tubing. The required degree of cross-linking, according to [[ASTM]] Standard F876, is between 65 and 89%. A higher degree of cross-linking could result in brittleness and stress cracking of the material, while a lower degree of cross-linking could result in product with poorer physical properties.\n\nCrosslinking improves the elevated-temperature properties of the base polymer. Adequate strength to 120\u2013150&nbsp;[[Celsius|\u00b0C]] is maintained by reducing creep, the tendency to flow. Chemical resistance is enhanced by resisting dissolution. Low temperature properties are improved. Impact and tensile strength, scratch resistance, and resistance to brittle fracture are enhanced.\n\nAlmost all cross-linkable polyethylene compounds (XLPE) for wire and cable applications are based on [[low-density polyethylene|LDPE]].\nXLPE-insulated cables have a rated maximum conductor temperature of 90&nbsp;\u00b0C and an emergency rating up to 140&nbsp;\u00b0C, depending on the standard used. They have a conductor short-circuit rating of 250&nbsp;\u00b0C. XLPE has excellent [[dielectric]] properties, making it useful for medium voltage\u20141 to 69&nbsp;kV AC, and [[high voltage cable]]s\u2014up to 380&nbsp;kV AC-voltage, and several hundred kV DC.\n\nNumerous modifications in the basic polymer structure can be made to maximize productivity during the manufacturing process. For medium voltage applications, reactivity can be boosted significantly. This results in higher line speeds in cases where limitations in either the curing or cooling processes within the continuous [[vulcanization]] (CV) tubes used to cross-link the insulation. XLPE insulations can be modified to limit the amount of by-product gases generated during the cross-linking process. This is particularly useful for [[high voltage cable]] and extra-high voltage cable applications, where degassing requirements can significantly lengthen cable manufacturing time.\n\n== Preparation methods ==\nThe first PEX material was prepared in the 1930s, by [[irradiation|irradiating]] the extruded tube with an [[cathode ray|electron beam]]. The [[electron beam processing]] method was made feasible in the 1970s but was still expensive. In the 1960s, Engel cross-linking was developed. In this method, a [[peroxide]] is mixed with the HDPE before extruding, the cross-linking taking place during the passage of the melted polymer through a long heated [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]. In 1968, the Sioplas process using [[silane]] was patented, followed by another silane-based process, Monosil, in 1974. A process using [[vinylsilane]] followed in 1986.\n\n[[File:XLPE powder in mold used in Rotational Molding by Roto Dynamics Inc.jpg|thumb|Raw material: XLPE powder used in [[rotational molding]] in a factory]]\n\n== Classification ==\n\n=== North America ===\nAll PEX pipe is manufactured with its design specifications listed directly on the pipe.

Cell classifications for PEX include 0006, 0008, 1006, 1008, 3006, 3008, 5006 and 5008, the most common being 5006.  Classifications 0306, 3306, 5206 and 5306 are also common, these materials containing ultraviolet blockers and/or inhibitors for limited UV resistance. In North America all PEX tubing products are manufactured to ASTM, NSF and CSA product standards, among them the aforementioned ASTM standard F876 as well as F877, [[NSF International]] standards NSF 14 and NSF 61 (\"NSF-pw\"), and [[Canadian Standards Association]] standard B137.5, to which the pipes are tested, certified and listed. The listings and certifications met by each product appear on the printline of the pipe or tubing to ensure the product is used in the proper applications for which it was designed.\n\n=== Europe ===\nIn European standards. there are three classifications are referred to as PEX-A, -B, and -C. The classes are not related to any type of rating system.\n\n====PEX-A (PE-Xa, PEXa)====\nPEX-A is produced by the peroxide (Engel) method. This method performs \"hot\" cross-linking, above the crystal melting point. However, the process takes slightly longer than the other two methods as the polymer has to be kept at high temperature and pressure for long periods during the extrusion process. The cross-linked bonds are between [[carbon]] atoms.\n\n====PEX-B (PE-Xb, PEXb)====\nThe [[silane]] method, also called the \"moisture cure\" method, results in PEX-B. In this method, cross-linking is performed in a secondary post-extrusion process, producing cross-links between a cross-linking agent. The process is accelerated with heat and moisture. The cross-linked bonds are formed through silanol condensation between two grafted vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS) units, connecting the polyethylene chains with C-C-Si-O-Si-C-C bridges.\n\n====PEX-C (PE-Xc, PEXc)====\nPEX-C is produced through [[electron beam processing]], in a \"cold\" cross-linking process (below the crystal melting point). It provides less uniform, lower-degree cross-linking than the Engel method, especially at tube diameters over one inch (2.5&nbsp;cm). When the process is not controlled properly, the outer layer of the tube may become brittle. However, it is the cleanest, most environmentally friendly method of the three, since it does not involve other chemicals and uses only high-energy electrons to split the carbon-[[hydrogen]] bonds and facilitate cross-linking.\n\n== Plumbing ==\n[[File:Col.lector terra radiant.JPG|thumb|Radiant heating system manifold using PEX tubing]]\n[[File:Burst pipe from freezing.jpg|thumb|All pipes, including this copper exterior valve as well as PEX, can burst from freezing, although several reports suggest that PEX takes longer to burst under freezing conditions.]]\n[[File:PEX piping bending in a basement.jpg|thumb|upright|PEX's flexibility means fewer connections, better water flow, faster and easier installations.]]\n[[File:PEX compression connectors.jpg|thumb|A PEX compression fitting makes it possible to join copper and PEX pipes by simply pushing them together for a watertight fit.]]\n[[File:PexMall-Brass-Crimp-Fittings-For-PEX.jpg|thumb|Brass crimp fittings, another popular type of fittings primarily used for connection PEX to PEX, PEX to Threaded pipes. 1.Drop Ear Elbows connect PEX and threaded pipe at a 90-degree 2.PEX to Copper Solder Adapter 3.PEX to Copper Threaded Adapter 4.PEX to Female Threaded Adapter 5.PEX Plug - terminate end of pipe 6.PEX to PEX Coupling 7.PEX to PEX 90-degree Elbow 8.PEX to Copper Adapter 9.PEX to Copper 90-degree Elbow 10.

The piping is approved for potable hot- and cold-water plumbing systems as well as for hydronic heating systems in all plumbing and mechanical codes in the United States and Canada.

Increasingly, in the 2000s, copper pipes as well as plastic PVC pipes are being replaced with PEX.<ref name=twsI14/> PEX can be used for underground purposes, although one report suggested that appropriate \"sleeves\" be used for such applications.<ref name=twsI28/>\n\n=== Benefits ===\nBenefits of using PEX in plumbing include:\n* '''Flexibility'''. PEX has become a contender for use in residential water plumbing because of its flexibility.<ref name=twsI24/> It can bend into a wide-radius turn if space permits, or accommodate turns by using elbow joints. In addition, it can handle short-radius turns, sometimes supported with a metal brace; in contrast, PVC, CPVC and [[copper]] all require elbow joints. A single length of PEX pipe cannot handle a sharp 90-degree turn, however, so in those situations, it is necessary to connect two PEX pipes with a 90-degree PEX elbow joint.\n* '''Direct routing of pipes'''. PEX can run straight from a distribution point to an outlet fixture without cutting or splicing the pipe. This reduces the need for potentially weak and costly joints and reduces the drop in pressure due to turbulence induced at transitions. Since PEX is flexible, it is often possible to install a supply line directly from the water source to an appliance using just one connection at each end.<ref name=twsI11/>\n* '''Greater water pressure at fixtures.''' Since PEX pipes typically have fewer sharp turns, there is greater water pressure at the sinks and showers and toilets where it is needed.\n* '''Lower materials cost'''. Cost of materials is approximately 25% of alternatives.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Television program ''Ed The Plumber'', [[DIY Network]], 2006</ref><ref name=twsI22/> One account suggested that the price of copper had quadrupled from 2002 to 2006.<ref name=twsI11/>\n* '''Easier installation'''. Installing PEX is much less labor-intensive than copper pipes, since there is no need to use torches to solder pipes together, or to use glue to attach pipes to fittings.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> One [[home inspector]] wrote that \"Once you've worked with PEX, you'll never go back to that other stinky glue stuff.\"<ref name=twsI32/> Builders putting in radiant heating systems found that PEX pipes \"made installation easy and operation problem-free\".<ref name=twsI24>{{cite news\n |first= Alan J. |last=Heavens\n |title= No cool solution to removing heated tiles\n |newspaper= The Philadelphia Inquirer\n |quote= I assume that the radiant floor heating involves piping that is embedded in Gypcrete, a lightweight blend of concrete and gypsum that, in concert with a shift to flexible PEX piping, has made installation easy and operation problem-free.\n |date= August 11, 2006\n |url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-08-11/business/0608110020_1_tile-heating-paint\n |accessdate= 2011-07-09\n}}</ref> PEX connections can be made by pushing together two matching parts using a compression fitting, or by using an adjustable [[wrench]] or a special crimping tool.<ref name=twsI11/> Generally, fewer connections and fittings are needed in a PEX installation.<ref name=twsI13 />\n* '''Non-corrodible'''. PEX, unlike copper, is not subject to corrosion from minerals or moisture.<ref name=twsI13 />\n* '''No fire risk during installation'''. The oldest and most common method for joining copper piping is to solder pieces together using a torch.  With an open flame there is always the risk of causing a fire in the surrounding structure, but PEX installation does not require a flame.<ref>https://www.lubrizol.com/CPVC/FlowGuard/Documents/Technical-Reports/Fire-Risks-of-Metallic-Plumbing-Systems-Draw-National-Attention.pdf</ref>\n* '''Ability to merge new PEX with existing copper and PVC systems'''. Manufacturers make fittings allowing installers to join a copper pipe on one end with a PEX line at the other,<ref name=twsI11/> as well as giving options to reduce or expand the diameter of the pipes.\n* '''Longevity'''. The advantageous properties of PEX also make it a candidate for progressive replacement of metal and thermoplastic pipes, especially in long-life applications, because the expected lifetime of PEX pipes reaches 50 years. However, the longest warranty offered by any PEX producer is 25 years.\n* '''Suitable for hot and cold pipes'''.

There have been some claimed PEX systems failures in the U.S., Canada and Europe resulting in several pending [[class action lawsuit]]s. The failures are claimed to be a result of the brass fittings used in the PEX system. Generally, builders and manufacturers have learned from these experiences and have found the best materials for use in fittings used to connect pipe with connectors, valves and other fittings. But there were problems reported with a specific type of brass fitting used in connection with installations in [[Nevada]] that caused a negative interaction between its mineral-rich [[hard water]]<ref name=twsI26/> and so-called \"yellow brass\" fittings.<ref name=twsI28/> Zinc in the fittings leached into the pipe material in a chemical reaction known as [[dezincification]], causing some leaks or blockages.<ref name=twsI26>{{cite news\n |first= Jeff |last=Pope\n |title= Pipe work begins in homes involved in Kitec lawsuit\n |newspaper= Las Vegas Sun\n |quote= The polyethylene pipes contained a thin layer of aluminum that held its shape as plumbers twisted and bent it.

One source suggested that pipe insulation, applied to PEX using certain adhesives, could have a detrimental effect causing the pipe to age prematurely; however, other insulating materials can be used, such as conventional foam wrap insulation, without negative effects.<ref name=twsI25>{{cite news\n |first= Steve |last=Maxwell\n |title= Put basement repair to wet weather test\n |newspaper= Toronto Star\n |quote= Q: Is it safe to use pipe wrap insulation on PEX water supply pipes? In a magazine put out by a home improvement retailer, it warns that a chemical reaction between insulation and PEX will eventually destroy the pipes. Is this true? A: To answer your question, I contacted one of the world's largest producers of PEX pipe. The only potential issue they know of has to do with certain types of adhesives touching the pipe surface. PEX includes antioxidants for stabilizing against chlorine, and these antioxidants can become destabilized in a reaction with adhesives, possibly aging the pipe prematurely. That said, they don't know of any issues relating to a chemical reaction between PEX and conventional foam pipe wrap insulation. I've installed foam insulation on PEX in my own house about a year ago, and there's no visible signs of trouble.\n |date= Feb 28, 2009\n |url= http://www.thestar.com/comment/columnists/article/593179\n |accessdate= 2011-07-09\n}}</ref>\n* '''Fitting expenses'''. Generally, PEX fittings, particularly the do-it-yourself compression ones, are more expensive than copper ones, although there is no soldering required.<ref name=twsI11/> Due to the flexibility of PEX, it generally requires fewer fittings, which tends to offset the higher cost per fitting.\n* '''Potential problems for PEX radiant heating with iron-based components'''. If plain PEX tubing is used in a radiant heating system that has [[ferrous]] radiators or other parts, meaning they are made out of [[iron]] or its alloys, then there is the possibility of [[rust]] developing over time; if this is the case, then one solution is to have an \"oxygen barrier\" in these systems to prevent rust from developing. Most modern installations of PEX for heating use oxygen barrier coated PEX.\n* '''Odors and chemical taste in potable water'''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Is It Safe to Drink Water out of Plastic Pipes?|url=http://grist.org/living/is-it-safe-to-drink-water-out-of-plastic-pipes/|website=[[Grist (magazine)|Grist.org]]|first=Umbra|last=Fisk|date=2015-01-08|accessdate=2016-04-22}}</ref>\n* '''Possible health effects.''' There was controversy in [[California]] during the 2000s about health concerns.

It is primarily utilized in radiant floor systems but is gaining popularity as a leach-free domestic potable water pipe, primarily in commercial applications.\n* '''[[Polybutylene]] (PB) Pipe''' is a form of plastic polymer that was used in the manufacture of potable water piping from late 70's until 1995. However, it was discovered that the polyoxymethylene (POM or Acetal) connectors originally utilized to connect the polybutylene tubes were susceptible to stress enhanced chemical attack by hypochlorite additions (a common chemical used to sanitize water).  Degraded connectors can crack and leak in highly stressed crimped areas, causing damage to the surrounding building structure.   Later systems containing copper fittings do not appear to have issues with hypochlorite attack, but polybutylene has still fallen out of favor due to costly structural damage caused by earlier issues and is not accepted in Canada and U.S.\n\n=== PEX-AL-PEX ===\n'''PEX-AL-PEX''' pipes, or '''AluPEX''', or '''PEX/Aluminum/PEX''', or '''Multilayer''' pipes are made of a layer of [[Aluminium|aluminum]] sandwiched between two layers of PEX. The metal layer serves as an [[oxygen]] barrier, stopping the oxygen diffusion through the polymer matrix, so it cannot dissolve into the water in the tube and corrode the metal components of the system.<ref name=\"Holohan\">{{cite web |url=http://www.heatinghelp.com/newsletter.cfm?Id=18 |title=PEX choices | work=Home Heating Systems Newsletter |accessdate=2008-06-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080611050844/http://www.heatinghelp.com/newsletter.cfm?Id=18 |archivedate = June 11, 2008}}</ref> The aluminium layer is thin, typically 1 or 2&nbsp;mm, and provides some rigidity to the tube such that when bent it retains the shape formed (normal PEX tube will spring back to straight). The aluminium layer also provides additional structural rigidity such that the tube will be suitable for higher safe operating temperatures and pressures.\n\n=== PEX tool kit ===\nA PEX tool kit includes a number of basic [[tool]]s required for making fittings and connections with PEX tubing. In most cases, such kits are either bought at a local [[hardware store]], plumbing supply store or assembled by either a home owner or a [[Independent contractor|contractor]]. PEX tools kits range from under $100 and can go up to $300+. A typical PEX tool kit includes [[Crimp (joining)|crimp tools]], an expander tool for joining, [[Clamp (tool)|clamp tools]], PEX cutters, rings, boards, and [[stapler]]s.{{elucidate|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Other uses for PEX==\n* '''Artificial joints'''. Highly cross-linked polyethylene is used in [[artificial joint]]s as a wear-resistant material. Cross-linked polyethylene is preferred in [[hip replacement]] because of its resistance to abrasive wear. [[Knee replacement]], however, requires PE made with different parameters because cross-linking may affect mechanical strength and there is greater stress-concentration in knee joints due to lower geometric congruency of the bearing surfaces. Manufacturers start with [[UHMWPE#Medical|ultra high molecular weight polyethylene]], and crosslink with either electron beam or gamma irradiation.\n* '''Dental applications'''. Some application of PEX has also been seen in dental restoration as a composite filling material.\n* '''Watercraft'''. PEX is also used in many canoes and kayaks. The PEX is listed by the name Ram-X, and other brand specific names. Because of the properties of Cross-Linked Polyethylene, repair of any damage to the hull is rather difficult. Some adhesives, such as 3M's DP-8005, are able to bond to PEX, while larger repairs require melting and mixing more Polyethylene into the canoe/kayak to form a solid bond and fill the damaged area.\n* '''Power cable insulation'''. Cross-linked polyethylene is widely used as electrical insulation in [[power cable]]s of all voltage ranges but it is especially well suited to medium voltage applications. It is the most common polymeric insulation material.  The acronym XLPE is commonly used to denote cross-linked polyethylene insulation.\n* [[File:XLPE automotive duct.jpg|thumb|XLPE automotive duct]] '''Automotive ducts and housings'''. PEX also referred to as XLPE is widely used in the aftermarket automotive industry for cold air intake systems and filter housings. Its properties include high heat deflection temperature, good impact resistance, chemical resistance, low flexural modulus and good environmental stress crack resistance. This form of XLPE is most commonly used in [[rotational molding]]; the XLPE resin comes in the form of a 35&nbsp;[[mesh (scale)|mesh]] (500&nbsp;[[\u00b5m]]) resin powder.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[High-density polyethylene]] (HDPE)\n* [[Linear low-density polyethylene]] (LLDPE)\n* [[Low-density polyethylene]] (LDPE)\n* [[Medium-density polyethylene]] (MDPE)\n* [[Stretch wrap]]\n* [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]] (UHMWPE)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.thehomeinspector.com/Newsletter/Wicklund/1WicklundIndex.html Why is Polybutylene pipe] such big deal?
