It enables [[train]]s to move by providing a dependable surface for their [[train wheel|wheels]] to [[rolling|roll]]. For clarity it is often referred to as '''railway track''' (British English and [[International Union of Railways|UIC terminology]]) or '''railroad track''' (predominantly in the United States). Tracks where [[electric train (disambiguation)|electric train]]s or [[electric tram]]s run are equipped with an [[railway electrification system|electrification system]] such as an [[overhead line|overhead electrical power line]] or an [[third rail|additional electrified rail]].\n\nThe term ''permanent way'' also refers to the track in addition to lineside structures such as fences etc.\n\n==Structure==\n\n===Traditional track structure===\n[[File:Close-up of railway track.jpg|thumb|left|Railway track (new) showing traditional features of ballast, part of sleeper and fixing mechanisms]]\n[[File:Section through railway track and foundation.png|upright=2.0|thumb|left|Section through railway track and foundation showing the ballast and formation layers. The layers are slightly sloped to help drainage. <br> Sometimes there is a layer of rubber matting (not shown) to improve drainage, and to dampen sound and vibration.]]\nNotwithstanding modern technical developments, the overwhelmingly dominant track form worldwide consists of flat-bottom steel rails supported on timber or pre-stressed concrete sleepers, which are themselves laid on crushed stone [[Track ballast|ballast]].\n\nMost railroads with heavy traffic use continuously welded rails supported by sleepers attached via baseplates that spread the load. A plastic or rubber pad is usually placed between the rail and the tieplate where concrete sleepers are used. The rail is usually held down to the sleeper with resilient fastenings, although [[cut spike]]s are widely used in North American practice. For much of the 20th century, rail track used softwood timber sleepers and jointed rails, and a considerable extent of this track type remains on secondary and tertiary routes. The rails were typically of flat bottom section fastened to the sleepers with dogspikes through a flat tieplate in North America and Australia, and typically of bullhead section carried in cast iron chairs in British and Irish practice.  The [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] pioneered the change to flat-bottomed rail and the supposed advantage of bullhead rail - that the rail could be turned over and re-used when the top surface had become worn - turned out to be unworkable in practice because the underside was usually ruined by fretting from the chairs.\n\nJointed rails were used at first because the technology did not offer any alternative. However, the intrinsic weakness in resisting vertical loading results in the ballast becoming depressed and a heavy maintenance workload is imposed to prevent unacceptable geometrical defects at the joints. The joints also needed to be lubricated, and wear at the fishplate (joint bar) mating surfaces needed to be rectified by shimming. For this reason jointed track is not financially appropriate for heavily operated railroads.\n\nTimber sleepers are of many available timbers, and are often treated with [[creosote]], copper-chrome-arsenic, or other wood preservative. Pre-stressed concrete sleepers are often used where timber is scarce and where tonnage or speeds are high. Steel is used in some applications.\n\nThe [[track ballast]] is customarily crushed stone, and the purpose of this is to support the sleepers and allow some adjustment of their position, while allowing free drainage.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Ballastless track===\n[[File:Track of Singapore LRT.jpg|thumb|Track of [[Singapore LRT]]]]\n[[File:China high speed rail ballastless tracks.JPG|thumb|left|Ballastless high-speed track in China]]\nA disadvantage of traditional track structures is the heavy demand for maintenance, particularly surfacing (tamping) and lining to restore the desired [[track geometry]] and smoothness of vehicle running. Weakness of the subgrade and drainage deficiencies also lead to heavy maintenance costs. This can be overcome by using ballastless track. In its simplest form this consists of a continuous slab of concrete (like a highway structure) with the rails supported directly on its upper surface (using a resilient pad).\n\nThere are a number of proprietary systems, and variations include a continuous reinforced concrete slab, or alternatively the use of pre-cast pre-stressed concrete units laid on a base layer. Many permutations of design have been put forward.\n\nHowever, ballastless track has a high initial cost, and in the case of existing railroads the upgrade to such requires closure of the route for a long period. Its whole-life cost can be lower because of the reduction in maintenance. Ballastless track is usually considered for new very high speed or very high loading routes, in short extensions that require additional strength (e.g. rail stations), or for localised replacement where there are exceptional maintenance difficulties, for example in tunnels.\n\n===Ladder track===\n{{Main|Ladder track}}\n[[Image:FloatingLadder.JPG|thumb|Ladder track at [[Shinagawa Station]], Tokyo, Japan]]\nLadder track utilizes sleepers aligned along the same direction as the rails with rung-like gauge restraining cross members.

It took many decades to improve the quality of the materials, including the change from iron to steel. The stronger the rails and the rest of the trackwork, the heavier and faster the trains the track can carry.\n\nOther profiles of rail include: [[Bullhead rail]]; [[Grooved rail]]; \"[[Rail profile#Flat bottomed rail|Flat-bottomed rail]]\" (Vignoles rail or Flanged T rail; Bridge rail (inverted U shaped used in [[Baulk road]]; [[Barlow rail]] (inverted V); and [[Grooved rail]].\n\nNorth American railroads until the mid- to late-20th century used rails {{convert|39|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} long so they could be carried in [[gondola (rail)|gondola cars]] ([[open wagons]]), often {{convert|40|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} long; as gondola sizes increased, so did [[rail length]]s.\n\nAccording to  the ''[[Railway Gazette]]'' the 150 kilometre rail line being built for the [[Baffinland Iron Mine]], on [[Baffin Island]], will use older [[carbon steel]] alloys for its rails, instead of more modern, higher performance alloys, because modern alloy rails can become brittle at very low temperatures.<ref name=RailwayGazette20080724>\n{{cite news\n| url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news_view/article/2008/07/8652/heavy_haul_in_the_high_north.html\n| title=Heavy haul in the high north\n| publisher=[[Railway Gazette]]\n| author=Carolyn Fitzpatrick\n| date=2008-07-24\n| accessdate=2008-08-10\n| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.railwaygazette.com%2Fnews_view%2Farticle%2F2008%2F07%2F8652%2Fheavy_haul_in_the_high_north.html&date=2009-05-01\n| archivedate=2009-05-01\n| quote = Premium steel rails will not be used, because the material has an increased potential to fracture at very low temperatures.

[[Hardwood]] such as [[Jarrah]] and [[Karri]] were better than [[softwood]]s such as [[Fir]].  Longitudinal sleepers such as Brunel's baulk road are topped with iron or steel rails that are lighter than they then might otherwise be because of the support of the sleepers.\n\n===Rail classification (weight)===\n{{Main|Rail profile}}\n{{See also|Speed limits in the United States (rail)}}\nRail is graded by weight over a standard length.  Heavier rail can support greater axle loads and higher train speeds without sustaining damage than lighter rail, but at a greater cost. In North America and the United Kingdom, rail is graded by its [[linear density]] in [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] per [[yard]] (usually shown as ''pound'' or ''lb''), so ''130-pound rail'' would weigh {{convert|130|lb/yd|kg/m|abbr=on}}. The usual range is {{convert|115|to|141|lb/yd|kg/m|abbr=on}}. In Europe, rail is graded in kilograms per metre and the usual range is {{convert|40|to|60|kg/m|lb/yd|abbr=on}}. The heaviest rail mass-produced was {{convert|155|lb/yd|kg/m}} and was rolled for the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. The United Kingdom is in the process of transition from the imperial to metric rating of rail.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n==Joining rails==\nRails are produced in fixed lengths and need to be joined end-to-end to make a continuous surface on which trains may run. The traditional method of joining the rails is to bolt them together using metal [[fishplate]]s (jointbars in the US), producing ''jointed track''. For more modern usage, particularly where higher speeds are required, the lengths of rail may be welded together to form '''continuous welded rail''' (CWR).\n\n===Jointed track===\n[[File:THORN-155lb-PS-jointed-joint.jpg|thumb|left|Bonded main line 6-bolt rail joint on a segment of {{convert|155|lb/yd|kg/m|1|abbr=on}} rail. Note how adjacent bolts are oppositely oriented to prevent complete separation of the joint in the event of being struck by a wheel during a derailment.]]\nJointed track is made using lengths of rail, usually around {{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long (in the UK) and {{convert|39|or|78|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} long (in North America), bolted together using perforated steel plates known as ''fishplates'' (UK) or ''joint bars'' (North America).\n\n[[Fishplate]]s are usually {{convert|600|mm|ft|0|abbr=on}} long, used in pairs either side of the rail ends and [[Bolted joint|bolted]] together (usually four, but sometimes six [[Machine screw|bolts]] per joint). The bolts may be oppositely-oriented so that in the event of a [[derailment]] and a wheel [[flange]] striking the joint, only some of the bolts will be sheared, reducing the likelihood of the rails misaligning with each other and exacerbating the seriousness of the derailment. This technique is not applied universally, European practice being to have all the bolt heads on the same side of the rail. Small gaps which function as [[expansion joint]]s are deliberately left between the rail ends to allow for expansion of the rails in hot weather. European practice was to have the rail joints on both rails adjacent to each other, while North American practice is to stagger them.\n\nBecause of the small gaps left between the rails, when trains pass over jointed tracks they make a \"clickety-clack\" sound. Unless it is well-maintained, jointed track does not have the ride quality of welded rail and is less desirable for [[high-speed rail|high speed trains]]. However, jointed track is still used in many countries on lower speed lines and [[siding (rail)|sidings]], and is used extensively in poorer countries due to the lower construction cost and the simpler equipment required for its installation and maintenance.\n\nA major problem of jointed track is cracking around the bolt holes, which can lead to breaking of the rail head (the running surface). This was the cause of the [[Hither Green rail crash]] which caused [[British Rail]]ways to begin converting much of its track to Continuous Welded Rail.\n\n====Insulated joints====\nWhere [[track circuit]]s exist for [[railway signalling|signalling]] purposes, insulated block joints are required. These compound the weaknesses of ordinary joints. Specially-made glued joints, where all the gaps are filled with [[epoxy|epoxy resin]], increase the strength again.\n\nAs an alternative to the insulated joint, [[audio frequency]] track circuits can be employed using a [[LC circuit|tuned loop]] formed in approximately {{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} of the rail as part of the blocking circuit.  Some insulated joints are unavoidable within turnouts.\n\nAnother alternative is the [[axle counter]], which can reduce the number of track circuits and thus the number of insulated rail joints required.\n\n===Continuous welded rail===\n[[File:Geschweisster schienenstoss.jpeg|thumb|left|Welded rail joint]]\n[[File:LIRR-Winter-Flames.jpg|thumb|A pull-apart on the [[Long Island Rail Road]] [[Babylon Branch]] being repaired by using flaming rope to expand the rail back to a point where it can be joined together]]\n\nMost modern railways use '''continuous welded rail''' (CWR), sometimes referred to as '''ribbon rails'''. In this form of track, the rails are [[welding|welded]] together by utilising [[Flash welding|flash butt welding]] to form one continuous rail that may be several kilometres long. Because there are few joints, this form of track is very strong, gives a smooth ride, and needs less maintenance; trains can travel on it at higher speeds and with less friction. Welded rails are more expensive to lay than jointed tracks, but have much lower maintenance costs. The first welded track was used in Germany in 1924 and the US in 1930<ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://www.arema.org/eseries/scriptcontent/custom/e_arema/library/1999_Conference_Proceedings/00059.pdf\n|title= Thermite Rail Welding: History, Process Developments, Current Practices And Outlook For The 21st Century\n|accessdate= 2008-07-06\n|author= C. P. Lonsdale\n|date=September 1999\n|format= PDF\n|work= Proceedings of the AREMA 1999 Annual Conferences\n|publisher= The [[American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association]]\n|page= 2\n}}</ref> and has become common on [[Main line (railway)|main lines]] since the 1950s.\n\nThe preferred process of flash butt welding involves an automated track-laying machine running a strong [[electric current|electrical current]] through the touching ends of two unjoined pieces of rail. The ends become white hot due to electrical resistance and are then pressed together forming a strong weld. [[Thermite welding]] is used to repair or splice together existing CWR segments.  This is a manual process requiring a reaction crucible and form to contain the molten iron. Thermite-bonded joints are seen as less reliable and more prone to fracture or break.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nIf not restrained, rails would lengthen in hot weather and shrink in cold weather. To provide this restraint, the rail is prevented from moving in relation to the sleeper by use of clips or anchors. Attention needs to be paid to compacting the ballast effectively, including under, between, and at the ends of the sleepers, to prevent the sleepers from moving. Anchors are more common for wooden sleepers, whereas most concrete or steel sleepers are fastened to the rail by special clips that resist longitudinal movement of the rail. There is no theoretical limit to how long a welded rail can be. However, if longitudinal and lateral restraint are insufficient, the track could become distorted in hot weather and cause a derailment. Distortion due to heat expansion is known in North America as [[sun kink]], and elsewhere as buckling. In extreme hot weather special inspections are required to monitor sections of track known to be problematic.\n\nAfter new segments of rail are laid, or defective rails replaced (welded-in), the rails can be artificially stressed if the temperature of the rail during laying is cooler than what is desired. The [[Rail stressing|stressing process]] involves either heating the rails causing them to expand,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.grandadsez.co.uk/railways/continuous-rail.html| title=Continuous Welded Rail| work=Grandad Sez: Grandad's Railway Engineering Section| accessdate=2006-06-12}}</ref> or stretching the rails with [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] equipment. They are then fastened (clipped) to the sleepers in their expanded form. This process ensures that the rail will not expand much further in subsequent hot weather. In cold weather the rails try to contract, but because they are firmly fastened, cannot do so. In effect, stressed rails are a bit like a piece of stretched [[Elastomer|elastic]] firmly fastened down.\n\nCWR rail is laid (including fastening) at a temperature roughly midway between the extremes experienced at that location. (This is known as the \"rail neutral temperature\"). This installation procedure is intended to prevent tracks from buckling in summer heat or pulling apart in winter cold. In North America, because broken rails (known as a ''pull-apart'') are typically detected by interruption of the current in the signaling system, they are seen as less of a potential hazard than undetected heat kinks.\n\n[[File:Expansion joint, Hayle.jpg|thumb|An expansion joint on the [[Cornish Main Line]], England]]\nJoints are used in continuous welded rail when necessary, usually for signal circuit gaps. Instead of a joint that passes straight across the rail, the two rail ends are sometimes cut at an angle to give a smoother transition. In extreme cases, such as at the end of long bridges, a [[breather switch]] (referred to in North America and Britain as an ''expansion joint'') gives a smooth path for the wheels while allowing the end of one rail to expand relative to the next rail.\n\n==Sleepers==\n{{Main|Railroad tie}}\n\nA sleeper is a rectangular object on which the rails are supported and fixed. The sleeper has two main roles: to transfer the loads from the rails to the [[track ballast]] and the ground underneath, and to hold the rails to the correct width apart (to maintain the [[rail gauge]]). They are generally laid transversely to the rails.\n\n===Fixing rails to sleepers===\n{{Main|Rail fastening system}}\n\nVarious methods exist for fixing the rail to the sleeper. Historically spikes gave way to cast iron chairs fixed to the sleeper, more recently springs (such as ''[[Pandrol]] clips'') are used to fix the rail to the sleeper chair.\n\n==Portable track==\n[[File:Panama Canal under construction, 1907.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|Panama Canal construction track]]\nSometimes rail tracks are designed to be portable and moved from one place to another as required. During construction of the [[Panama Canal]], tracks were moved around excavation works. These tracks were {{Track gauge|5ft|lk=on}} and the rolling stock full size.  Portable tracks have often been used in open pit mines.\n\n[[Sugarcane|Cane]] railways often had permanent tracks for the main lines, with portable tracks serving the canefields themselves.  These tracks were [[narrow gauge]] (for example, {{Track gauge|2ft|lk=on}}) and the portable track came in straights, curves, and turnouts, rather like on a model railway.<ref>[[Narrow Gauge Down Under]] magazine, January 2010, p. 20.</ref>\n\n[[Decauville]] was a source of many portable light rail tracks, also used for military purposes.\n\nThe '''permanent way''' is so called because '''temporary way''' tracks were often used in the construction of that permanent way.\n\n==Layout==\n{{Main|Track geometry}}\nThe geometry of the tracks is three-dimensional by nature, but the standards that express the speed limits and other regulations in the areas of track gauge, alignment, elevation, curvature and track surface are usually expressed in two separate layouts for [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] and [[Vertical direction|vertical]].\n\nHorizontal layout is the track layout on the [[Multiview orthographic projection#Plan|horizontal plane]]. This involves the layout of three main track types: '''tangent track''' (straight line), '''curved track''', and '''[[track transition curve]]''' (also called '''transition spiral''' or '''spiral''') which connects between a tangent and a curved track.\n\nVertical layout is the track layout on the [[Multiview orthographic projection#Elevation|vertical plane]] including the concepts such as crosslevel, [[Cant (road/rail)|cant]] and [[Grade (slope)|gradient]].<ref>{{cite book|title=PART 1025  Track Geometry|year=2008|publisher=Department of Planning Transport, and Infrastructure - Government of South Australia|url=http://www.dpti.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/word_doc/0004/40684/Part_1025_Rail_Track_geometry.doc|edition=Issue 2 \u2013 07/10/08}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Track Standards Manual - Section 8: Track Geometry|date=December 1998|publisher=Railtrack PLC|url=http://www.rgsonline.co.uk/Railway_Group_Standards/Infrastructure/Railway%20Group%20Standards/GCRT5017%20Iss%202.pdf|accessdate=13 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Gauge===\n{{Main|Track gauge|List of track gauges}}\n[[File:Gauge EN.svg|thumb|center|350px|Measuring rail gauge]]\nDuring the early days of rail, there was considerable variation in the gauge used by different systems. Today, 54.8% of the world's railways use a gauge of {{Track gauge|1435mm}}, known as [[Standard gauge|standard]] or [[Standard gauge|international gauge]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}<!--ref needed for usage of 'international gauge'-->  Gauges wider than standard gauge are called [[broad gauge]]; narrower, [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]]. Some stretches of track are [[dual gauge]], with three (or sometimes four) parallel rails in place of the usual two, to allow trains of two different gauges to use the same track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/1520mm/message/90710|title=message in the mailing list '1520mm' on \u042075 rails}}</ref>\n\nGauge can safely vary over a range.  For example, U.S. federal safety standards allow standard gauge to vary from {{convert|4|ft|8|in|mm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|4|ft|9+1/2|in|mm|abbr=on}} for operation up to {{convert|60|mph|km/h|1|abbr=on}}.\n\n==Maintenance==\n[[File:Sectiongang hungerford1917.jpg|thumb|left|220px|USA section gang (gandy dancers) responsible for maintenance of a particular section of railway.

Inadequate maintenance may lead to a \"slow order\" (North American terminology, a \"slack\" or speed restriction in the United Kingdom) being imposed to avoid accidents (see [[Slow zone]]). Track maintenance was at one time hard [[manual labour]], requiring teams of labourers, or trackmen (US: [[gandy dancer]]s; UK: [[platelayer]]s; Australia: fettlers), who used lining bars to correct irregularities in horizontal alignment (line) of the track, and tamping and jacks to correct vertical irregularities (surface). Currently, maintenance is facilitated by a variety of specialised machines.\n\n[[File:Track Flange Oiler.JPG|thumb|right|Flange oilers lubricate wheel flanges to reduce rail wear in tight curves, [[Middelburg, Mpumalanga]], [[South Africa]]]]\nThe surface of the head of each of the two rails can be maintained by using a [[railgrinder]].\n\nCommon maintenance jobs include changing sleepers, lubricating and adjusting [[Railroad switch|switches]], tightening loose track components, and surfacing and lining track to keep straight sections straight and curves within maintenance limits. The process of sleeper and rail replacement can be automated by using a [[track renewal train]].\n\nSpraying ballast with [[herbicide]] to prevent weeds growing through and redistributing the ballast is typically done with a special weed killing train.\n\nOver time, ballast is crushed or moved by the weight of trains passing over it, periodically requiring relevelling (\"tamping\") and eventually to be cleaned or replaced. If this is not done, the tracks may become uneven causing swaying, rough riding and possibly derailments. An alternative to tamping is to lift the rails and sleepers and reinsert the ballast beneath. For this, specialist \"[[stoneblower]]\" trains are used.\n\n[[Rail inspection]]s utilize [[nondestructive testing]] methods to detect internal flaws in the rails. This is done by using specially equipped [[Road-rail vehicle|HiRail trucks]], inspection cars, or in some cases handheld inspection devices.\n\nRails must be replaced before the railhead profile wears to a degree that may trigger a derailment. Worn mainline rails usually have sufficient life remaining to be used on a [[branch line]], [[siding (rail)|siding]] or [[Railroad terminology#S|stub]] afterwards and are \"cascaded\" to those applications.\n\nThe environmental conditions along railroad track create a unique [[railroad ecology|railway ecosystem]]. This is particularly so in the [[United Kingdom]] where steam locomotives are only used on special services and vegetation has not been trimmed back so thoroughly. This creates a fire risk in prolonged dry weather.\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the [[cess (rail transport)|cess]] is used by track repair crews to walk to a work site, and as a safe place to stand when a train is passing. This helps when doing minor work, while needing to keep trains running, by not needing a Hi-railer or transport vehicle blocking the line to transport crew to get to the site.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Risanatrice.jpg|Maintenance of way equipment in [[Italy]]\nFile:Maintenance of way.jpg|A [[track renewal train]] in [[Pennsylvania]]\n</gallery>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Bed and foundation==\n[[File:A newly constructed railway station in Bereket city, October 2013.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Railway reinforced by concrete between the tracks, [[Bereket]], [[Turkmenistan]], 2013.]]\n[[File:ICE TrainTrack.JPG|thumb|left|250px|[[Intercity-Express]] Track, [[Germany]]]]\n[[File:Toyohashi Station 001.JPG|thumb|right|250px|On this Japanese high-speed line, mats have been added to stabilize the ballast]]\nRailway tracks are generally laid on a bed of stone [[track ballast]] or [[track bed]], in turn is supported by prepared earthworks known as the track formation. The formation comprises the [[land grading|subgrade]] and a layer of sand or stone dust (often sandwiched in impervious plastic), known as the blanket, which restricts the upward migration of wet clay or silt. There may also be layers of waterproof fabric to prevent water penetrating to the subgrade.  The track and ballast form the [[permanent way: historical development|permanent way]]. The term foundation may be used to refer to the ballast and formation, i.e. all man-made structures below the tracks.\n\nAdditional measures are required where the track is laid over [[permafrost]], such as on the [[Qingzang Railway]] in [[Tibet]]. For example, transverse pipes through the subgrade allow cold air to penetrate the formation and prevent that subgrade from melting.\n\nThe sub-grade layers are slightly sloped to one side to help drainage of water.  Rubber sheets may be inserted to help drainage and also protect iron bridgework from being affected by rust.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Trains}}\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Degree of curvature]]\n* [[Comparison of train and tram tracks|Difference between train and tram rails]]\n* [[Exothermic welding]]\n* [[Glossary of rail terminology]]<br> (including US/UK and other<br> regional/national differences)\n* [[Monorail]]\n* [[Rack railway]]\n* [[Street running]]\n* [[TGV track construction]]\n* [[Tramway (industrial)]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}\n\n== Bibliography==\n{{Commons category|Rail tracks}}\n* Pike, J., (2001), ''Track'', Sutton Publishing, ISBN 0-7509-2692-9\n* Firuziaan, M. and Estorff, O., (2002), ''Simulation of the Dynamic Behavior of Bedding-Foundation-Soil in the Time Domain'',  Springer Verlag.\n* {{Cite book| last = Robinson | first = A M | title = Fatigue in railway infrastructure | publisher = Woodhead Publishing Limited | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-85573-740-2}}\n* {{Cite book| last = Lewis | first = R | title = Wheel/rail interface handbook | publisher = Woodhead Publishing Limited | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-84569-412-8}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.akrailroad.com/tee-rail-sections-data Table of North American tee rail (flat bottom) sections ]\n* [http://www.oberbauhandbuch.de/en/oberbauhandbuch/oberbaustoffe/schienen/vignolschienen.html ThyssenKrupp handbook, Vignoles rail]\n* [http://www.oberbauhandbuch.de/en/oberbauhandbuch/oberbaustoffe/schienen/vignolschienen-feldbahnschienen.html ThyssenKrupp handbook, Light Vignoles rail]\n* [http://scalefour.org/resources/trackdetails02.htm Track Details in photographs ]\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=qOIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA886 \"Drawing of England Track Laying in Sections at 200 yards an hour\" ''Popular Mechanics'', December 1930]\n*{{ citation |url=http://www.railwaywondersoftheworld.com/permanent-way.html |chapter= The permanent way| title=Railway Wonders of the World| year=1936 |pages = 331\u2013338 |editor-first=Clarence |editor-last=Winchester }} illustrated description of the construction and maintenance of the railway\n* [http://www.railway-technical.com/track.shtml Railway technical]\n\n{{Rail tracks}}\n{{Railway track layouts}}\n\n[[Category:Permanent way| ]]\n[[Category:Railway track layouts]]\n[[Category:Railway lines]]\n[[Category:Structural steel]]\n[[Category:Rail infrastructure]]"}]}}}}
