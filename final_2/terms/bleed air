Additionally, bleed air is used to keep critical parts of the aircraft (such as the wing [[leading edge]]s) ice-free.<ref name=\"skybrary\">{{cite web | url=http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Bleed_Air_Systems | title=Bleed Air Systems | publisher=Skybrary.aero | accessdate=January 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBleed air is used on many aircraft systems because it is easily available, reliable, and a potent source of power. For example, bleed air from an airplane engine is used to start the remaining engines. [[Aircraft lavatory|Lavatory]] water storage tanks are pressurized by bleed air that is fed through a [[pressure regulator]].<ref name=\"skybrary\" />\n\nWhen used for [[cabin pressurization]], the bleed air from the engine must first be cooled (as it exits the compressor stage at temperatures as high as 250&nbsp;\u00b0C) by passing it through an air-to-air [[heat exchanger]] cooled by cold outside air. It is then fed to an [[air cycle machine]] unit which regulates the temperature and flow of air into the cabin, keeping the environment comfortable.<ref name=\"skybrary\" />\n\nBleed air is also used to heat the engine intakes. This prevents ice from accumulating, breaking loose, and being ingested by the engine, possibly damaging it.<ref name=\"skybrary2\">{{cite web | url=http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Ice_Protection_Systems | title=Ice Protection Systems | publisher=Skybrary | accessdate=January 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn aircraft powered by jet engines, a similar system is used for [[Ice protection system|wing anti-icing]] by the 'hot-wing' method. In icing conditions, water droplets [[condensation|condensing]] on a wing's leading edge can freeze. If that happens, the ice build-up adds weight and changes the shape of the wing, causing a degradation in performance, and possibly a critical loss of control or [[Lift (force)|lift]]. To prevent this, hot bleed air is pumped through the inside of the wing's leading edge, heating it to a temperature above freezing, which prevents the formation of ice. The air then exits through small holes in the wing edge.\n\nOn propeller-driven aircraft, it is common to use bleed air to inflate a rubber boot on the leading edge, breaking the ice loose after it has already formed.<ref name=\"skybrary\" /><ref name=\"skybrary2\" />\n\nBleed air from the high-pressure compressor of the engine is used to supply [[Harrier Jump Jet#Specifications|reaction control valves]] as used for part of the [[flight control system]] in the [[Harrier jump jet]] family of military aircraft.<ref>\"[http://www.harrier.org.uk/technical/Basic_TechNet.htm Technical]\" page on harrier.org.uk website, viewed 2013-11-24</ref>\n\n==Contamination==\n{{Main|Fume event}}\n{{POV-section|date=January 2016}}\nOn rare occasions, bleed air used for air conditioning and pressurization can be contaminated by chemicals such as oil or hydraulic fluid.<ref name=WSJ_>{{cite web | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204900904574302293012711628.html | title=Up in the Air: New Worries About \u2018Fume Events\u2019 on Planes | publisher=Wall Street Journal | date=30 July 2009 | accessdate=29 December 2012 | author=Sarah Nassauer}}</ref> This is known as a fume event.

This alleged long-term illness is referred to as [[aerotoxic syndrome]] by agenda groups, but it is not a medically recognized syndrome. One alleged potential contaminant is [[tricresyl phosphate]].\n\nA number of lobbying groups have been set up to advocate for research into this alleged hazard.

Recent improvements in solid-state electronics have enabled pneumatic power systems to be replaced by electric power systems. In a bleedless aircraft such as the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|Boeing 787]], each engine has two variable-frequency electrical generators to compensate for not providing compressed air to external systems. Eliminating bleed air and replacing it with extra electric generation is believed to provide a net improvement to engine efficiency, lower weight and ease maintenance.<ref>[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/articles/qtr_4_07/AERO_Q407_article2.pdf AERO 787 No Bleed Systems] The Boeing Company 2008</ref>\n\n===Benefits===\nA bleedless aircraft achieves fuel efficiency by eliminating the process of compressing and decompressing air, and by reducing the aircraft's mass due to the removal of ducts, valves, heat exchangers, and other heavy equipment.<ref name=\"boeing\">{{cite web | url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/articles/qtr_4_07/article_02_1.html | title=787 No-Bleed Systems | publisher=Boeing | year=2008 | accessdate=January 1, 2013 | author=Sinnett, Mike}}</ref>\n\nThe APU (auxiliary power unit) does not need to supply bleed air when the main engines are not operating. Aerodynamics are improved due to the lack of bleed air vent holes on the wings. By driving cabin air supply compressors at the minimum required speed, no energy wasting modulating valves are required. High temperature, high-pressure [[air cycle machine]] (ACM) packs can be replaced with low temperature, low pressure packs to increase efficiency. At cruise altitude, where most aircraft spend the majority of their time and burn the majority of their fuel, the ACM packs can be bypassed entirely, saving even more energy. Since no bleed air is taken from the engines for the cabin, the potential of engine oil contamination of the cabin air supply is eliminated.<ref name=\"boeing\" />\n\nLastly, advocates of the design say it improves safety as heated air is confined to the engine pod, as opposed to being pumped through pipes and heat exchangers in the wing and near the cabin, where a leak could damage surrounding systems.<ref name=\"boeing\" />\n\n===Tradeoffs===\nIn the 787, cabin air enters from under the fuselage and is compressed as required. De-icing is achieved by electro-thermal heating elements embedded in the wing's leading edge. Hydraulic pumps for flaps, slats, speed brakes and other control surfaces are also powered electrically.\n\nEliminating bleed air increases the electric load, as cabin pressurization, anti-ice/de-ice systems, and other functions need to be powered electrically instead. This necessitates an increased size of electrical generators as well as higher-wattage power distribution boards and more sophisticated backup and control systems.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cabin pressurization]]\n* [[Environmental control system (aircraft)]]\n* [[Aerotoxic syndrome]]\n* [[Ice protection system]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Aircraft gas turbine engine components}}\n{{Aircraft components}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bleed Air}}\n[[Category:Aerospace engineering]]\n[[Category:Jet engines]]\n[[Category:Occupational safety and health]]"}]}}}}
