Gravity assistance can be used to [[accelerate]] a spacecraft, that is, to increase or decrease its speed and/or redirect its path. The \"assist\" is provided by the motion of the gravitating body as it pulls on the spacecraft.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dave Doody|url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf4-1.php |title=Basics of Space Flight Section I. The Environment of Space |website=Jpl.nasa.gov |date=2004-09-15 |accessdate=2016-06-26}}</ref> It was used by interplanetary probes from ''[[Mariner 10]]'' onwards, including the two ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' probes' notable [[planetary flyby|flyby]]s of Jupiter and Saturn.\n\n==Explanation==\nA gravity assist around a planet changes a spacecraft's [[velocity]] (relative to the [[Sun]]) by entering and leaving the gravitational field of a planet. The spacecraft's speed increases as it approaches the planet and decreases while escaping its gravitational pull (which is approximately the same). Because the planet orbits the sun, the spacecraft is affected by this motion during the maneuver. To increase speed, the spacecraft flies with the movement of the planet (taking a small amount of the planet's orbital energy); to decrease speed, the spacecraft flies against the movement of the planet. The sum of the kinetic energies of both bodies remains constant (see [[elastic collision]]). A slingshot maneuver can therefore be used to change the spaceship's trajectory and speed relative to the Sun.\n\nA close terrestrial analogy is provided by a tennis ball bouncing off the front of a moving train.  Imagine standing on a train platform, and throwing a ball at 30&nbsp;km/h toward a train approaching at 50&nbsp;km/h.  The driver of the train sees the ball approaching at 80&nbsp;km/h and then departing at 80&nbsp;km/h after the ball bounces elastically off the front of the train.  Because of the train's motion, however, that departure is at 130&nbsp;km/h relative to the train platform; the ball has added twice the train's velocity to its own.\n\n[[File:Gravitational slingshot.svg|left|thumb|200px|Simplified example of gravitational slingshot: the spacecraft's speed changes by up to twice the planet's speed]]\n\nTranslating this analogy into space, then, a \"stationary\" observer sees a planet moving left at speed ''U'' and a spaceship moving right at speed ''v''. If the spaceship has the proper trajectory, it will pass close to the planet, moving at speed ''U + v'' relative to the planet's surface because the planet is moving in the opposite direction at speed ''U''. When the spaceship leaves orbit, it is moving at speed ''U + v'' relative to the planet's surface but in the opposite direction (to the left).  Since the planet is moving left at speed ''U'', the total velocity of the spaceship relative to the observer will be the velocity of the moving planet plus the velocity of the spaceship with respect to the planet. So the velocity will be ''U + (U + v) = 2U + v ''.\n\nThis oversimplified example is impossible to refine without additional details regarding the orbit, but if the spaceship travels in a path which forms a [[parabolic orbit|parabola]], it can leave the planet in the opposite direction without firing its engine, and the speed gain at large distance is indeed ''2U'' once it has left the gravity of the planet far behind.\n\nThis explanation might seem to violate the conservation of energy and momentum, apparently adding velocity to the spacecraft out of nothing, but the spacecraft's effects on the planet must also be taken into consideration to provide a complete picture of the mechanics involved.  The linear momentum gained by the spaceship is equal in magnitude to that lost by the planet, so the spacecraft gains velocity and the planet loses velocity. However, the planet's enormous mass compared to the spacecraft makes the resulting change in its speed negligibly small.  These effects on the planet are so slight (because planets are so much more massive than spacecraft) that they can be ignored in the calculation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/bob.johnson/SL/ |title=Slingshot effect |website=Dur.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-06-26}}</ref>\n\nRealistic portrayals of encounters in space require the consideration of three dimensions.  The same principles apply, only adding the planet's velocity to that of the spacecraft requires [[vector addition]], as shown below.\n\n[[File:Grav slingshot diag.svg|center|400px|thumb|Two-dimensional schematic of gravitational slingshot. The arrows show the direction in which the spacecraft is traveling before and after the encounter. The length of the arrows shows the spacecraft's speed.]]\n[[File:Mdis depart anot.ogv|thumb||250px|A view from MESSENGER as it uses Earth as a gravitational slingshot to decelerate to allow insertion into an orbit around Mercury.]]\n\nDue to the [[reversibility of orbits]], gravitational slingshots can also be used to reduce the speed of a spacecraft. Both [[Mariner 10]] and [[MESSENGER]] performed this maneuver to reach [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].\n\nIf even more speed is needed than available from gravity assist alone, the most economical way to utilize a rocket burn is to do it near the [[periapsis]] (closest approach). A given rocket burn always provides the same change in velocity ([[\u0394v]]), but the change in kinetic energy is proportional to the vehicle's velocity at the time of the burn. So to get the most kinetic energy from the burn, the burn must occur at the vehicle's maximum velocity, at periapsis. [[Oberth effect]] describes this technique in more detail.\n\n== Historical origins of the method ==\nIn his paper \u201c\u0422\u0435\u043c \u043a\u0442\u043e \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u044c\u201d (To those who will be reading [this paper] in order to build [an interplanetary rocket]),<ref>Kondratyuk\u2019s paper is included in the book:  Mel\u2019kumov, T.

If the spacecraft's purpose is only to fly by the inner planet, then there is typically no need to slow the spacecraft. However, if the spacecraft is to be inserted into [[orbit]] about that inner planet, then there must be some way to slow down the spacecraft.\n \nSimilarly, while the orbital speed of an outer planet is less than that of the Earth, a spacecraft leaving the Earth at the minimum speed needed to travel to some outer planet is slowed by the Sun's gravity to a speed far less than the orbital speed of that outer planet. Thus, there must be some way to accelerate the spacecraft when it reaches that outer planet if it is to enter orbit about it. However, if the spacecraft is accelerated to more than the minimum required, less total propellant will be needed to enter orbit about the target planet. In addition, accelerating the spacecraft early in the flight will reduce the travel time.\n\nRocket engines can certainly be used to increase and decrease the speed of the spacecraft. However, rocket thrust takes propellant, propellant has mass, and even a small increment \u0394''v'' (delta-''v'') in velocity translates to far larger requirement for propellant needed to escape Earth's [[gravity well]]. This is because not only must the primary stage engines lift that extra propellant, they must also lift more propellant still, to lift that additional propellant. Thus the liftoff mass requirement [[rocket equation|increases exponentially]] with an increase in the required delta-''v'' of the spacecraft.\n\nSince a gravity assist maneuver can greatly change the speed of a spacecraft without expending propellant, it can save significant amounts of propellant.\n\nAs an example, the [[MESSENGER|Messenger]] mission used gravity assist maneuvering to slow the spacecraft on its way to Mercury; however, since Mercury has almost no atmosphere, aerobraking could not be used for insertion into orbit around it.\n\nJourneys to the nearest planets, [[Mars]] and [[Venus]], often use a [[Hohmann transfer orbit]], an [[ellipse|elliptical]] path which starts as a [[tangent]] to one planet's orbit round the Sun and finishes as a tangent to the other. When other bodies are unavailable for gravity assists, this often takes the minimum amount of propellant.\n\nHowever, using a Hohmann transfer orbit, it might take decades for a spaceship to travel to the outer planets ([[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]) and it requires a very large [[delta-v budget]], because the spacecraft would have to travel for 800 million km (500 million miles) or more against the force of the Sun's gravity. Therefore, as gravitational assist maneuvers offer a way to gain speed without using  propellant, all missions to the outer planets have used them.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\n==Limits to slingshot use==\n[[Image:Voyager 2 path.svg|thumb|The Planetary Grand Tour trajectory of Voyager 2.]]\nThe main practical limit to the use of a gravity assist maneuver is that planets and other large masses are seldom in the right places to enable a voyage to a particular destination. For example, the [[Voyager 1|Voyager]] missions which started in the late 1970s were made possible by the \"[[Planetary Grand Tour|Grand Tour]]\" alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. A similar alignment will not occur again until the middle of the 22nd century. That is an extreme case, but even for less ambitious missions there are years when the planets are scattered in unsuitable parts of their orbits.\n\nAnother limitation is the atmosphere, if any, of the available planet. The closer the spacecraft can approach, the faster its [[periapsis]] speed as gravity accelerates the spacecraft, allowing for more kinetic energy to be gained from a rocket burn. However, if a spacecraft gets too deep into the atmosphere, the energy lost to drag can exceed that gained from the planet's gravity. On the other hand, the atmosphere can be used to accomplish [[aerobraking]].  There have also been theoretical proposals to use [[lift (force)|aerodynamic lift]] as the spacecraft flies through the atmosphere. This maneuver, called an [[aerogravity assist]], could bend the trajectory through a larger angle than gravity alone, and hence increase the gain in energy.\n\nInterplanetary slingshots using the Sun itself are not possible because the Sun is at rest relative to the Solar System as a whole. However, thrusting when near the Sun has the same effect as the powered slingshot described at [[Oberth effect]]. This has the potential to magnify a spacecraft's thrusting power enormously, but is limited by the spacecraft's ability to resist the heat.\n\nAn ''interstellar'' slingshot using the Sun is conceivable, involving for example an object coming from elsewhere in our galaxy and swinging past the Sun to boost its galactic travel. The energy and angular momentum would then come from the Sun's orbit around the [[Milky Way]].  This concept features prominently in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s 1972 award-winning novel [[Rendezvous With Rama]]; his story concerns an interstellar spacecraft that uses the Sun to perform this sort of maneuver, and in the process alarms many nervous humans.\n\nA [[rotating black hole]] might provide additional assistance, if its spin axis is aligned the right way. [[General relativity]] predicts that a large spinning mass produces [[frame-dragging]]\u2014close to the object, space itself is dragged around in the direction of the spin. Any ordinary rotating object produces this effect. Although attempts to measure frame dragging about the Sun have produced no clear evidence, experiments performed by [[Gravity Probe B]] have detected frame-dragging effects caused by Earth.<ref name=PRL>{{cite journal| year=2011| title=Gravity Probe B: Final Results of a Space Experiment to Test General Relativity| journal=Physical Review Letters| volume = 106 | issue = 22 | page=221101 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.221101 |arxiv =1105.3456 | bibcode=2011PhRvL.106v1101E | pmid=21702590}}</ref> General relativity predicts that a spinning black hole is surrounded by a region of space, called the [[ergosphere]], within which standing still (with respect to the black hole's spin) is impossible, because space itself is dragged at the speed of light in the same direction as the black hole's spin. The [[Penrose process]] may offer a way to gain energy from the ergosphere, although it would require the spaceship to dump some \"ballast\" into the black hole, and the spaceship would have had to expend energy to carry the \"ballast\" to the black hole.\n\n==Timeline of notable examples==\n\n===Mariner 10 \u2013 first use in an interplanetary trajectory===\nThe [[Mariner 10]]  probe was the first spacecraft to use the gravitational slingshot effect to reach another planet, passing by Venus on February 5, 1974, on its way to becoming the first spacecraft to explore [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].\n\n===Voyager 1 \u2013 farthest human-made object===\nAs of August 31, 2014, [[Voyager 1]] is over 128.8&nbsp;[[astronomical unit|AU]] (19.2 billion km) from the Sun,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heavens-above.com/SolarEscape.aspx?lat=0&lng=0&loc=Unspecified&alt=0&tz=UCT |title=Spacecraft escaping the Solar System |publisher=Heavens-above.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-26}}</ref> and is in [[Interstellar medium|interstellar space]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/interstellarvoyager/ |title=Voyager Enters Interstellar Space - NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory |publisher=Jpl.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-06-26}}</ref> It gained the energy to escape the Sun's gravity completely by performing slingshot maneuvers around Jupiter and Saturn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/gravity-assist-primer.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 29, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040502135954/http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/gravity-assist-primer.cfm |archivedate=May 2, 2004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heavens-above.com/solar-escape.asp?lat%3D0%26lng%3D0%26loc%3DUnspecified%26alt%3D0%26tz%3DCET |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108062848/http://www.heavens-above.com/solar-escape.asp?lat=0&lng=0&loc=Unspecified&alt=0&tz=CET |archivedate=January 8, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Galileo \u2013 a change of plan===\nThe [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]] spacecraft was launched by [[NASA]] in 1989 aboard [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'']].  Its original mission was designed to use a direct [[Hohmann transfer]]. However, Galileo's intended booster, the cryogenically fueled (Hydrogen/Oxygen) [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] booster rocket was prohibited as a Shuttle \"cargo\" for safety considerations following the loss of [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']]. With its substituted solid rocket upperstage, the IUS, which could not provide as much delta-''v'', Galileo did not ascend directly to Jupiter, but flew by Venus once and Earth twice in order to reach Jupiter in December, 1995.\n\nThe Galileo engineering review speculated (but was never able to prove conclusively) that this longer flight time coupled with the stronger sunlight near Venus caused lubricant in Galileo's main antenna to fail, forcing the use of a much smaller backup antenna with a consequent lowering of data rate from the spacecraft.\n\nIts subsequent tour of the [[Moons of Jupiter|Jovian moons]] also used numerous slingshot maneuvers with those moons to conserve fuel and maximize the number of encounters.\n\n===The Ulysses probe changed the plane of its trajectory===\nIn 1990, NASA launched the [[European Space Agency|ESA]] spacecraft [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]] to study the [[geographical pole|polar]] regions of the [[Sun]]. All the planets orbit approximately in a plane aligned with the equator of the Sun. Thus, to enter an orbit passing over the poles of the Sun, the spacecraft would have to eliminate the 30&nbsp;km/s speed it inherited from the Earth's orbit around the Sun and gain the speed needed to orbit the Sun in the pole-to-pole plane \u2014 tasks that are impossible with current [[spacecraft propulsion]] systems alone, making gravity assist maneuvers essential.\n\nAccordingly, Ulysses was first sent toward Jupiter, aimed to arrive at a point in space just ahead and south of the planet. As it passed Jupiter, the probe fell through the planet's gravity field, exchanging momentum with the planet; this gravity assist maneuver bent the probe's trajectory northward relative to the Ecliptic Plane onto an orbit which passes over the poles of the Sun. By using this maneuver, Ulysses needed only enough propellant to send it to a point near Jupiter, which is well within current capability.\n\n===MESSENGER===\nThe [[MESSENGER]] mission (launched in August 2004) made extensive use of gravity assists to slow its speed before orbiting Mercury. The MESSENGER mission included\none flyby of Earth, two flybys of Venus, and three flybys of Mercury before finally arriving at Mercury in March 2011 with a velocity low enough to permit orbit insertion with available fuel. Although the flybys were primarily orbital maneuvers, each provided an opportunity for significant scientific observations.\n\n=== The Cassini probe \u2013 multiple gravity assists ===\nThe [[Cassini probe]] passed by Venus twice, then Earth, and finally Jupiter on the way to Saturn. The 6.7-year transit was slightly longer than the six years needed for a Hohmann transfer, but cut the extra velocity (delta-''v'') needed to about 2&nbsp;km/s, so that the large and heavy Cassini probe was able to reach Saturn, which would not have been possible in a direct transfer even with the [[Titan IV]], the largest launch vehicle available at the time. A [[Hohmann transfer]] to Saturn would require a total of 15.7&nbsp;km/s delta-''v'' (disregarding Earth's and Saturn's own gravity wells, and disregarding [[aerobraking]]), which is not within the capabilities of current launch vehicles and spacecraft propulsion systems.\n\n[[Image:Cassini interplanet trajectory.svg|center|Cassini Interplanetary Trajectory]]\n\n[[Image:Cassini's speed related to Sun.png|540px|center|thumbnail|''Cassini'''s speed related to Sun. The various gravity assists form visible peaks on the left, while the periodic variation on the right is caused by the spacecraft's orbit around Saturn. The data was from [[JPL Horizons Ephemeris System]]. The speed above is in kilometers per second. Note also that the minimum speed achieved during Saturnian orbit is more or less equal to Saturn's own orbital velocity, which is the ~5&nbsp;km/s velocity which Cassini matched to enter orbit.]]\n\n=== Solar Probe+ ===\nThe NASA [[Solar Probe+]] mission, scheduled for launch in 2018, will use multiple gravity assists at Venus to remove the Earth's angular momentum from the orbit, in order to drop down to a distance of 8.5 solar radii (5.9&nbsp;Gm) from the sun. This will be the closest approach to the sun of any space mission.\n\n===Rosetta \u2013 first spacecraft to match orbit with a comet===\nThe [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]] probe, launched in March 2004, used four gravity assist manoeuvres (including one just 250&nbsp;km from the surface of Mars) to accelerate throughout the inner Solar System - enabling it to match the velocity of the [[67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko]] comet at their rendezvous point in August 2014.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n*[[3753 Cruithne]]: an asteroid which periodically has gravitational slingshot encounters with Earth.\n*[[Delta-v budget|Delta-''v'' budget]]\n*[[Dynamical friction]]\n*[[Flyby anomaly]]: an anomalous delta-''v'' increase during gravity assists\n*[[Gravitational keyhole]]\n*[[Interplanetary Transport Network]]\n*[[N-body problem|''n''-body problem]]\n*[[New Horizons]]: a gravity-assisted mission (flying past Jupiter) that reached [[Pluto]] on 14 July 2015.\n*[[Pioneer 10]]\n*[[Pioneer 11]]: a gravity-assisted mission (flying past Jupiter 1974-12-03) to reach [[Saturn]] in 1979.\n*[[Pioneer H]]: first Out-Of-The-Ecliptic mission (OOE) proposed, for Jupiter and solar (Sun) observations.\n*[[STEREO]]: a gravity-assisted mission which used Earth's Moon to eject two spacecraft from Earth's orbit into [[heliocentric]] orbit\n*[[Voyager 2]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary}}\n*[http://www.dur.ac.uk/bob.johnson/SL/  Slingshot effect]\n*[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/doubal.html Slingshot effect, described in terms of elastic collisions]\n*[http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMXLE0P4HD_index_0.html Animation of Cassini Huygens gravitational slingshot]\n*{{MathPages|id=home/kmath114/kmath114|title=Gravitational Slingshot}}\n*[http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/missiongravityassistprimer/ A Quick Gravity Assist Primer]\n*[http://solar.cranf.net An artistical simulation of an unstable planetary system showing gravitational slingshots and other phenomena]\n*[http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/Stostars.htm Short discussion of modifying orbits by gravity assistance] part of a high school level course.\n\n{{spacecraft propulsion}}\n{{orbits}}\n{{Voyager program}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gravity Assist}}\n[[Category:Spacecraft propulsion]]\n[[Category:Astrodynamics]]\n[[Category:Effects of gravitation]]\n[[Category:Soviet inventions]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]"}]}}}}
