These different coordinates and corresponding basis vectors represent the same position vector. More general [[curvilinear coordinates]] could be used instead, and are in contexts like [[continuum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]] (in the latter case one needs an additional time coordinate).\n\n===''n'' dimensions===\n\n[[Linear algebra]] allows for the abstraction of an ''n''-dimensional position vector.

The notion of \"space\" is intuitive since each ''x<sub>i</sub>'' (''i'' = 1, 2, \u2026, ''n'') can be any value, the collection of values defines a point in space.\n\nThe ''[[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]]'' of the position space is ''n'' (also denoted dim(''R'') = ''n''). The ''[[coordinates]]'' of the vector '''r''' with respect to the basis vectors '''e'''<sub>''i''</sub> are ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>. The vector of coordinates forms the [[coordinate vector]] or ''n''-[[tuple]] (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, ''x<sub>n</sub>'').\n\nEach coordinate ''x<sub>i</sub>'' may be [[parametric equation|parameterized]] a number of [[parameter]]s ''t''. One parameter ''x<sub>i</sub>''(''t'') would describe a curved 1D path, two parameters ''x<sub>i</sub>''(''t''<sub>1</sub>, ''t''<sub>2</sub>) describes a curved 2D surface, three ''x<sub>i</sub>''(''t''<sub>1</sub>, ''t''<sub>2</sub>, ''t''<sub>3</sub>) describes a curved 3D volume of space, and so on.\n\nThe [[linear span]] of a basis set ''B'' = {'''e'''<sub>1</sub>, '''e'''<sub>2</sub>,  \u2026, '''e'''<sub>''n''</sub>} equals the position space ''R'', denoted span(''B'') = ''R''.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Differential geometry===\n\n{{main|Differential geometry}}\n\nPosition vector fields are used to describe continuous and differentiable space curves, in which case the independent parameter needs not be time, but can be (e.g.) arc length of the curve.\n\n===Mechanics===\n\n{{main|Newtonian mechanics|Analytical mechanics|Equation of motion}}\n\nIn any [[equation of motion]], the position vector '''r'''(''t'') is usually the most sought-after quantity because this function defines the motion of a particle (i.e. a [[point mass]]) - its location relative to a given [[coordinate system]] at some time ''t''.\n\nTo define motion in terms of position, each coordinate may be [[parameter|parametrized]] by time; since each successive value of time corresponds to a sequence of successive spatial locations given by the coordinates, so the continuum limit of many successive locations is a path the particle traces.\n\nIn the case of one dimension, the position has only one component, so it effectively degenerates to a scalar coordinate. It could be, say, a vector in the ''x''-direction, or the radial ''r''-direction.

Study of these higher order derivatives can improve approximations of the original displacement function. Such higher-order terms are required in order to accurately represent the displacement function as [[Taylor series|a sum of an infinite sequence]], enabling several analytical techniques in engineering and physics.\n\n== Relationship to displacement vectors ==\n\nA [[displacement vector]] can be defined as the ''action'' of uniformly translating spatial points in a given direction over a given distance. Thus the addition of displacement vectors expresses the composition of these displacement actions and scalar multiplication as scaling of the distance. With this in mind we may then define a ''position vector'' of a point in space as the displacement vector mapping a given origin to that point. Note thus position vectors depend on a choice of origin for the space, as well as displacement vectors depend on the choice of an initial point.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Affine space]]\n*[[Line element]]\n*[[Parametric surface]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references />\n\n== References ==\n# Keller, F.
