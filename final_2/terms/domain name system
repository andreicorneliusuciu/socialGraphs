It associates various information with [[domain name]]s assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical [[IP address]]es needed for the purpose of locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide, distributed [[directory service]], the Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality of the Internet, and has been in use since the 1980s. It was created in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris.\n\nThe Domain Name System delegates the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to Internet resources by designating [[authoritative name server]]s for each domain. Network administrators may delegate authority over [[sub-domain]]s of their allocated name space to other name servers. This mechanism provides distributed and fault tolerant service and was designed to avoid a single large central database.\n\nThe Domain Name System also specifies the technical functionality of the [[database]] service that is at its core. It defines the DNS protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in the DNS, as part of the [[Internet Protocol Suite]]. Historically, other directory services preceding DNS were not scalable to large or global directories as they were originally based on text files, prominently the [[HOSTS.TXT]] resolver.\n\nThe Internet maintains two principal [[namespace]]s, the domain name hierarchy<ref name=rfc1034>RFC 1034, ''Domain Names - Concepts and Facilities'', P. Mockapetris, The Internet Society (November 1987)</ref> and the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) [[address space]]s.<ref name=\"rfc781\">RFC 781, ''Internet Protocol - DARPA Internet Program Protocol Specification'', Information Sciences Institute, J. Postel (Ed.), The Internet Society (September 1981)</ref> The Domain Name System maintains the domain name hierarchy and provides translation services between it and the address spaces. Internet [[name server]]s and a communication [[network protocol|protocol]] implement the Domain Name System.<ref name=rfc1035>RFC 1035, ''Domain Names - Implementation and Specification'', P. Mockapetris, The Internet Society (November 1987)</ref> A DNS name server is a server that stores the DNS records for a domain; a DNS name server responds with answers to queries against its database.\n\nThe most common types of records stored in the DNS database are for Start of Authority (SOA), [[IP address]]es (A and AAAA), [[SMTP]] [[mail exchanger]]s (MX), [[name server]]s (NS), pointers for [[reverse DNS lookup]]s (PTR), and [[domain name alias]]es (CNAME). Although not intended to be a general purpose database, DNS can store records for other types of data for either automatic lookups, such as [[DNSSEC]] records, or for human queries such as ''responsible person'' (RP) records. As a general purpose database, the DNS has also been used in combating [[unsolicited email]] (spam) by storing a [[real-time blackhole list]].  The DNS database is traditionally stored in a structured [[zone file]].\n\n==Function==\nAn often-used analogy to explain the Domain Name System is that it serves as the [[telephone directory|phone book]] for the Internet by translating human-friendly computer [[hostname]]s into IP addresses. For example, the domain name [[example.com|www.example.com]] translates to the addresses 93.184.216.119 ([[IPv4]]) and 2606:2800:220:6d:26bf:1447:1097:aa7 ([[IPv6]]). Unlike a phone book, DNS can be quickly updated, allowing a service's location on the network to change without affecting the end users, who continue to use the same host name. Users take advantage of this when they use meaningful [[Uniform Resource Locator]]s (URLs), and [[e-mail address]]es without having to know how the computer actually locates the services.\n\nAdditionally, DNS reflects administrative partitioning.<ref>{{cite IETF |title=Domain Names - Implementation and Specification |rfc=1035 |sectionname=SOA RDATA format |section=3.3.13 |author1=Paul Mockapetris |year=1987 |month=November |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=18 December 2015 |quote=the original or primary source of data for this zone {{bracket|... and ...}} the mailbox of the person responsible for this zone}}</ref> For zones operated by a [[Domain name registry|registry]], also known as [[Public Suffix List|public suffix]] zones, administrative information is often complemented by the registry's [[Registration Data Access Protocol|RDAP]] and [[WHOIS]] services.

The domain name itself consists of the label, possibly concatenated with the name of its parent node on the right, separated by a dot.<ref name=dnsterms>{{cite IETF |title=Domain Names - Domain Concepts and Facilities |rfc=1034 |sectionname=Name space specifications and terminology |section=3.1 |author1=Paul Mockapetris |year=1987 |month=November |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=17 December 2015 }}</ref>\nThe tree sub-divides into ''zones'' beginning at the [[DNS root zone|root zone]].  A [[DNS zone]] may consist of only one domain, or may consist of many domains and sub-domains, depending on the administrative choices of the zone manager.  DNS can also be partitioned according to ''class''; the separate classes can be thought of as an array of parallel namespace trees.<ref name=dnsparts>{{cite IETF |title=Domain Names - Domain Concepts and Facilities |rfc=1034 |sectionname=How the database is divided into zones |section=4.2 |author1=Paul Mockapetris |year=1987 |month=November |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=17 December 2015 }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Domain name space.svg|right|thumb|400px|The hierarchical Domain Name System for class ''Internet'', organized into zones, each served by a name server]]\n\nAdministrative responsibility over any zone may be divided by creating additional zones. Authority over the new zone is said to be ''delegated'' to a designated name server. The parent zone ceases to be authoritative for the new zone.<ref name=dnsparts/>\n\n===Domain name syntax===\nThe definitive descriptions of the rules for forming domain names appear in RFC  1035, RFC 1123, and RFC 2181.\nA [[domain name]] consists of one or more parts, technically called ''labels'', that are conventionally concatenated, and delimited by dots, such as example.com.\n\nThe right-most label conveys the [[top-level domain]]; for example, the domain name www.example.com belongs to the top-level domain ''com''.\n\nThe hierarchy of domains descends from right to left; each label to the left specifies a subdivision, or [[subdomain]] of the domain to the right. For example: the label ''example'' specifies a subdomain of the ''com'' domain, and ''www'' is a subdomain of example.com. This tree of subdivisions may have up to 127 levels.\n\nA label may contain zero to 63 characters. The null label, of length zero, is reserved for the root zone. The full domain name may not exceed the length of 253 characters in its textual representation.<ref name=rfc1034/> In the internal binary representation of the DNS the maximum length requires 255 octets of storage, since it also stores the length of the name.<ref name=rfc1035/>\n\nAlthough domain names may theoretically consist of any character representable in an octet, host names use a preferred format and character set. The characters allowed in their labels are a subset of the [[ASCII]] character set, consisting of characters ''a'' through ''z'', ''A'' through ''Z'', digits ''0'' through ''9'', and hyphen. This rule is known as the ''LDH rule'' (letters, digits, hyphen). Domain names are interpreted in case-independent manner.<ref>\n  Network Working Group of the IETF,\n  January 2006,\n  RFC 4343: Domain Name System (DNS) Case Insensitivity Clarification\n</ref> Labels may not start or end with a hyphen.<ref name=rfc3696>RFC 3696, ''Application Techniques for Checking and Transformation of Names'', J. Klensin</ref> An additional rule requires that top-level domain names should not be all-numeric.<ref name=rfc3696 />\n\n===Internationalized domain names===\nThe limited set of ASCII characters permitted in the DNS prevented the representation of names and words of many languages in their native alphabets or scripts. To make this possible, [[ICANN]] approved the [[Internationalized domain name|Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications]] (IDNA) system, by which user applications, such as web browsers, map [[Unicode]] strings into the valid DNS character set using [[Punycode]]. In 2009 ICANN approved the installation of internationalized domain name [[Country code top-level domain|country code top-level domains (''ccTLD''s)]]. In addition, many [[domain name registry|registries]] of the existing top level domain names ([[Top-level domain|''TLD'']]s) have adopted the IDNA system.\n\n===Name servers===\nThe Domain Name System is maintained by a [[distributed database]] system, which uses the [[client\u2013server model]]. The nodes of this database are the [[name server]]s. Each domain has at least one authoritative DNS server that publishes information about that domain and the name servers of any domains subordinate to it. The top of the hierarchy is served by the [[root name server]]s, the servers to query when looking up (''resolving'') a TLD.\n\n====Authoritative name server====\nAn ''authoritative'' name server is a name server that only gives [[Name server#Authoritative answer|answers]] to DNS queries from data that has been configured by an original source, for example, the domain administrator or by dynamic DNS methods, in contrast to answers obtained via a query to another name server that only maintains a cache of data.\n\nAn authoritative name server can either be a ''master'' server or a ''slave'' server. A master server is a server that stores the original (''master'') copies of all zone records. A slave server uses a special automatic updating mechanism in the DNS protocol in communication with its master to maintain an identical copy of the master records.\n\nEvery DNS zone must be assigned a set of authoritative name servers. This set of servers is stored in the parent domain zone with name server (NS) records.\n\nAn authoritative server indicates its status of supplying definitive answers, deemed ''authoritative'', by setting a protocol flag, called the ''Authoritative Answer'' (''AA'') bit in its responses.<ref name=\"rfc1035\" /> This flag is usually reproduced prominently in the output of DNS administration query tools, such as [[Domain Information Groper|dig]], to indicate ''that the responding name server is an authority for the domain name in question.''<ref name=\"rfc1035\" />\n\n==Operation==\n{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Address resolution mechanism===\nDomain name resolvers determine the domain name servers responsible for the domain name in question by a sequence of queries starting with the right-most (top-level) domain label.\n\n[[Image:An example of theoretical DNS recursion.svg|right|thumb|400px|A DNS recursor consults three name servers to resolve the address www.wikipedia.org.]]\n\nFor proper operation of its domain name resolver, a network host is configured with an initial cache (''hints'') of the known addresses of the root name servers. The hints are updated periodically by an administrator by retrieving a dataset from a reliable source.\n\nAssuming the resolver has no cached records to accelerate the process, the resolution process starts with a query to one of the root servers.  In typical operation, the root servers do not answer directly, but respond with a referral to more authoritative servers, e.g., a query for \"www.wikipedia.org\" is referred to the ''org'' servers.   The resolver now queries the servers referred to, and iteratively repeat this process until it receives an authoritative answer.   The diagram illustrates this process for the host www.wikipedia.org.\n\nThis mechanism would place a large traffic burden on the root servers, if every resolution on the Internet would require starting at the root. In practice [[#Record caching|caching]] is used in DNS servers to off-load the root servers, and as a result, root name servers actually are involved in only a fraction of all requests.\n\n====Recursive and caching name server====\nIn theory, authoritative name servers are sufficient for the operation of the Internet. However, with only authoritative name servers operating, every DNS query must start with recursive queries at the [[DNS root zone|root zone]] of the Domain Name System and each user system would have to implement resolver software capable of recursive operation.\n\nTo improve efficiency, reduce DNS traffic across the Internet, and increase performance in end-user applications, the Domain Name System supports DNS cache servers which store DNS query results for a period of time determined in the configuration (''time-to-live'') of the domain name record in question.\nTypically, such caching DNS servers also implement the recursive algorithm necessary to resolve a given name starting with the DNS root through to the authoritative name servers of the queried domain. With this function implemented in the name server, user applications gain efficiency in design and operation.\n\nThe combination of DNS caching and recursive functions in a name server is not mandatory; the functions can be implemented independently in servers for special purposes.\n\n[[Internet service providers]]  typically provide recursive and caching name servers for their customers. In addition, many home networking routers implement DNS caches and recursors to improve efficiency in the local network.\n\n===DNS resolvers===\nThe client side of the DNS is called a DNS resolver. A resolver is responsible for initiating and sequencing the queries that ultimately lead to a full resolution (translation) of the resource sought, e.g., translation of a domain name into an IP address. An individual DNS query may be either ''non-recursive'', ''recursive'', or ''iterative'', or a combination of these.<ref name=\"rfc1034\" />\n\n*For the ''non-recursive query'' method, a DNS resolver client queries a DNS server that provides a record for a domain for which it is authoritative itself, or it provides a partial result without querying other servers. In case of a [[#Record_caching|caching DNS resolver]], the non-recursive query of its local [[Name server#Caching name server|DNS cache]] delivers a result and reduces the load on upstream DNS servers by caching DNS request records for a period of time after an initial response from upstream DNS servers.\n*For the ''recursive query'' approach, a DNS resolver client will query a single DNS server, which may then query (as a client itself) other DNS servers on behalf of the requester. For example, a simple \"stub resolver\" running on a [[home router]] will typically make a recursive query to the DNS server for the user's [[ISP]]. A ''recursive query'' is one for which the DNS server will fully answer the query (or give an error) by querying other name servers as needed. In typical operation, a client will issue a recursive query to a caching recursive DNS server, which will then issue non-recursive queries to determine the answer and send a single answer back to the client. The resolver, or another DNS server acting recursively on behalf of the resolver, negotiates use of recursive service using bits in the query headers. DNS servers are not required to support recursive queries.\n*For the ''iterative query'' procedure, a DNS resolver client will query a chain of one or more DNS servers. Each server will refer the client to the next server in the chain, until the current server can fully resolve the request. For example, a possible resolution of www.example.com would query a global root, then a .com server, and finally .example.com.\n\n===Circular dependencies and glue records===\nName servers in delegations are identified by name, rather than by IP address. This means that a resolving name server must issue another DNS request to find out the IP address of the server to which it has been referred. If the name given in the delegation is a subdomain of the domain for which the delegation is being provided, there is a [[circular dependency]]. In this case the name server providing the delegation must also provide one or more IP addresses for the authoritative name server mentioned in the delegation. This information is called ''glue''.   The delegating name server provides this glue in the form of records in the ''additional section'' of the DNS response, and provides the delegation in the ''authority section'' of the response.\n\nFor example, if the [[authoritative name server]] for example.org is ns1.example.org, a computer trying to resolve www.example.org first resolves ns1.example.org. Since ns1 is contained in example.org, this requires resolving example.org first, which presents a circular dependency. To break the dependency, the name server for the [[top level domain]] org includes glue along with the delegation for example.org.  The glue records are address records that provide IP addresses for ns1.example.org. The resolver uses one or more of these IP addresses to query one of the domain's authoritative servers, which allows it to complete the DNS query.\n\n===Record caching===\nThe DNS Resolution Process reduces the load on individual servers by ''caching'' DNS request records for a period of time after a response. This entails the local recording and subsequent consultation of the copy instead of initiating a new request upstream. The time for which a resolver caches a DNS response is determined by a value called the [[time to live]] (TTL) associated with every record. The TTL is set by the administrator of the DNS server handing out the authoritative response. The period of validity may vary from just seconds to days or even weeks.\n\nAs a noteworthy consequence of this distributed and caching architecture, changes to DNS records do not propagate throughout the network immediately, but require all caches to expire and refresh after the TTL. RFC 1912 conveys basic rules for determining appropriate TTL values.\n\nSome resolvers may override TTL values, as the protocol supports caching for up to 68 years or no caching at all. [[Negative cache|Negative caching]], i.e. the caching of the fact of non-existence of a record, is determined by name servers authoritative for a zone which must include the [[List of DNS record types#SOA|Start of Authority]] (SOA) record when reporting no data of the requested type exists. The value of the ''minimum'' field of the SOA record and the TTL of the SOA itself is used to establish the TTL for the negative answer.\n\n===Reverse lookup===\n{{Main article|Reverse DNS lookup}}\nA reverse lookup is a query of the DNS for domain names when the IP address is known. Multiple domain names may be associated with an IP address. The DNS stores IP addresses in the form of domain names as specially formatted names in pointer (PTR) records within the infrastructure top-level domain [[.arpa|arpa]]. For IPv4, the domain is in-addr.arpa.  For IPv6, the reverse lookup domain is ip6.arpa. The IP address is represented as a name in reverse-ordered octet representation for IPv4, and reverse-ordered nibble representation for IPv6.\n\nWhen performing a reverse lookup, the DNS client converts the address into these formats before querying the name for a PTR record following the delegation chain as for any DNS query. For example, assuming the IPv4 address 208.80.152.2 is assigned to Wikimedia, it is represented as a DNS name in reverse order: 2.152.80.208.in-addr.arpa. When the DNS resolver gets a pointer (PTR) request, it begins by querying the root servers, which point to the servers of [[American Registry for Internet Numbers]] (ARIN) for the 208.in-addr.arpa zone. ARIN's servers delegate 152.80.208.in-addr.arpa to Wikimedia to which the resolver sends another query for 2.152.80.208.in-addr.arpa, which results in an authoritative response.\n\n===Client lookup===\n[[Image:DNS in the real world.svg|right|thumb|400px|DNS resolution sequence]]\nUsers generally do not communicate directly with a DNS resolver. Instead DNS resolution takes place transparently in applications such as [[web browser]]s, [[e-mail client]]s, and other Internet applications. When an application makes a request that requires a domain name lookup, such programs send a resolution request to the [[DNS resolver]] in the local operating system, which in turn handles the communications required.\n\nThe DNS resolver will almost invariably have a cache (see above) containing recent lookups. If the cache can provide the answer to the request, the resolver will return the value in the cache to the program that made the request. If the cache does not contain the answer, the resolver will send the request to one or more designated DNS servers. In the case of most home users, the Internet service provider to which the machine connects will usually supply this DNS server: such a user will either have configured that server's address manually or allowed [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] to set it; however, where systems administrators have configured systems to use their own DNS servers, their DNS resolvers point to separately maintained name servers of the organization. In any event, the name server thus queried will follow the process outlined [[#Address resolution mechanism|above]], until it either successfully finds a result or does not. It then returns its results to the DNS resolver; assuming it has found a result, the resolver duly caches that result for future use, and hands the result back to the software which initiated the request.\n\n====Broken resolvers====\nSome large ISPs have configured their DNS servers to violate rules, such as by disobeying TTLs, or by indicating that a domain name does not exist just because one of its name servers does not respond.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://ask.slashdot.org/story/05/04/18/198259/providers-ignoring-dns-ttl\n|title = Providers ignoring DNS TTL?\n|publisher = [[Slashdot]]\n|year = 2005\n|accessdate = 2012-04-07\n}}</ref>\n\nSome applications, such as web browsers, maintain an internal DNS cache to avoid repeated lookups via the network. This practice can add extra difficulty when debugging DNS issues, as it obscures the history of such data. These caches typically use very short caching times \u2013 in the order of one minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dyn.com/web-browser-dns-caching-bad-thing/|title=Ben Anderson: Why Web Browser DNS Caching Can Be A Bad Thing|author=Ben Anderson|date=7 September 2011|publisher=|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Internet Explorer]] represents a notable exception: versions up to IE 3.x cache DNS records for 24 hours by default. Internet Explorer 4.x and later versions (up to IE 8) decrease the default time out value to half an hour, which may be changed by modifying default configuration.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;en-us;263558\n|title = How Internet Explorer uses the cache for DNS host entries\n|publisher = [[Microsoft Corporation]]\n|year = 2004\n|accessdate = 2010-07-25\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Google Chrome]] triggers a specific error message for DNS issues. When the DNS server is down or broken, Google Chrome returns an error message.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://appuals.com/best-fix-steps-fix-dns_probe_finished_nxdomain/\n|title = Google Chrome DNS Errors\n|publisher = Appuals\n|year = 2015\n|accessdate = 2016-08-28\n}}\n</ref>\n\n===Other applications===\nThe Domain Name System includes several other functions and features.\n\nHostnames and IP addresses are not required to match in a one-to-one relationship. Multiple hostnames may correspond to a single IP address, which is useful in [[virtual hosting]], in which many web sites are served from a single host. Alternatively, a single hostname may resolve to many IP addresses to facilitate [[fault-tolerance|fault tolerance]] and [[load balancing (computing)|load distribution]] to multiple server instances across an enterprise or the global Internet.\n\nDNS serves other purposes in addition to translating names to IP addresses. For instance, [[mail transfer agent]]s use DNS to find the best mail server to deliver [[e-mail]]. The domain to mail exchanger mapping provided by [[MX record]]s may present an additional layer of fault tolerance and load distribution.\n\nThe DNS is used for efficient storage and distribution of IP addresses of blacklisted email hosts. A common method is to place the IP address of the subject host into the sub-domain of a higher level domain name, and to resolve that name to a record that indicates a positive or a negative indication.\n\nFor example:\n* The address 102.3.4.5 is blacklisted. It points to 5.4.3.102.blacklist.example, which resolves to 127.0.0.1.\n* The address 102.3.4.6 is not blacklisted and points to 6.4.3.102.blacklist.example. This hostname is either not configured, or resolves to 127.0.0.2.\nE-mail servers can query blacklist.example to find out if a specific host connecting to them is in the blacklist. Many of such blacklists, either subscription-based or free of cost, are available for use by email administrators and anti-spam software.\n\nThe [[Sender Policy Framework]] and [[DomainKeys]] were designed to take advantage of another DNS record type, the [[TXT record]], but have since been assigned specific record types.\n\nTo provide resilience in the event of computer or network failure, multiple DNS servers are usually provided for coverage of each domain. At the top level of global DNS, thirteen groups of root name servers exist, with additional \"copies\" of them distributed worldwide via [[anycast]] addressing.\n\n[[Dynamic DNS]] (DDNS) updates a DNS server with a client IP address on-the-fly, for example, when moving between ISPs or mobile [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hot spots]], or when the IP address changes administratively.\n\n==DNS message format==\nThe DNS protocol uses two types of DNS messages, queries and replies, and they both have the same format. Each message consists of a header and four sections: question, answer, authority, and an additional space. A header field (''flags'') controls the content of these four sections.<ref name=rfc1034/>\n\nThe header section contains the following fields: ''Identification'', ''Flags'', ''Number of questions'', ''Number of answers'', ''Number of authority resource records'' (RRs), and ''Number of additional RRs''. The identification field can be used to match responses with queries. The flag field consists of several sub-fields. The first is a single bit which indicates if the message is a query (0) or a reply (1). The second sub-field consists of four bits; if the value is 1, the present packet is a reply; if it is 2, the present packet is a status; if the value is 0, the present packet is a request. A single-bit sub-field indicates if the DNS server is authoritative for the queried hostname. Another single-bit sub-field indicates if the client wants to send a recursive query (\"RD\"). The next single-bit sub-field indicates if the replying DNS server supports recursion (\"RA\"), since not all DNS servers are configured to do this task. Another sub-field indicates if the request was truncated for some reason (\"TC\"), and a four-bit sub-field indicates status. The ''question'' section contains the domain name and type of record (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, etc.) being resolved. The domain name is broken into discrete labels which are concatenated; each label is prefixed by the length of that label. The ''answer'' section has the resource records of the queried name. A domain name may occur in multiple records if it has multiple IP addresses associated.<ref>James F. Kurose and Keith W. Ross, Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 6th ed. Essex, England: Pearson Educ. Limited, 2012</ref>\n\n==Protocol transport==\nDNS primarily uses the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) on [[port number]] 53 to serve requests.<ref name=rfc1035/> DNS queries consist of a single UDP request from the client followed by a single UDP reply from the server. The [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) is used when the response data size exceeds 512 bytes, or for tasks such as [[DNS zone transfer|zone transfers]]. Some resolver implementations use TCP for all queries.\n\n{{anchor|resource records|resource record}}\n\n==DNS resource records==\nThe Domain Name System specifies a set of various [[List of DNS record types|types of resource records]] (RRs), which are the basic information elements of the domain name system. Each record has a type (name and number), an expiration time ([[Time to live#DNS records|time to live]]), a class, and type-specific data. Resource records of the same type are described as a ''resource record set'' (RRset). The order of resource records in a set, which is returned by a resolver to an application, is undefined, but often servers implement [[round-robin DNS|round-robin ordering]] to achieve [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]]. The [[Domain Name System Security Extensions]] (DNSSEC), however, work on the complete set of resource record in canonical order.\n\nWhen sent over an [[Internet Protocol]] network, all records use the common format specified in RFC 1035:<ref>RFC 5395, ''Domain Name System (DNS) IANA Considerations'', D. Eastlake 3rd (November 2008), Section 3</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ Resource record (RR) fields\n|-\n! Field !! Description !! Length ([[Octet (computing)|octets]])\n|-\n| NAME || Name of the node to which this record pertains || Variable\n|-\n| TYPE || Type of RR in numeric form (e.g., 15 for MX RRs) || 2\n|-\n| CLASS || Class code || 2\n|-\n| [[Time to live|TTL]] || Count of seconds that the RR stays valid (The maximum is 2<sup>31</sup>\u22121, which is about 68 years) || 4\n|-\n| RDLENGTH || Length of RDATA field || 2\n|-\n| RDATA || Additional RR-specific data || Variable, as per RDLENGTH\n|}\n\n''NAME'' is the fully qualified domain name of the node in the tree. On the wire, the name may be shortened using label compression where ends of domain names mentioned earlier in the packet can be substituted for the end of the current domain name. A free standing ''@'' is used to denote the current origin.\n\n''TYPE'' is the record type. It indicates the format of the data and it gives a hint of its intended use. For example, the ''A'' record is used to translate from a domain name to an [[IPv4 address]], the ''NS'' record lists which name servers can answer lookups on a [[DNS zone]], and the ''MX'' record specifies the mail server used to handle mail for  a domain specified in an e-mail address.\n\n''RDATA'' is data of type-specific relevance, such as the IP address for address records, or the priority and hostname for MX records. Well known record types may use label compression in the RDATA field, but \"unknown\" record types must not (RFC 3597).\n\nThe ''CLASS'' of a record is set to IN (for ''Internet'') for common DNS records involving Internet hostnames, servers, or IP addresses. In addition, the classes [[Chaosnet|Chaos]] (CH) and [[Hesiod (name service)|Hesiod]] (HS) exist.<ref>RFC 5395, ''Domain Name System (DNS) IANA Considerations'', D. Eastlake 3rd (November 2008), p. 11</ref>  Each class is an independent name space with potentially different delegations of DNS zones.\n\nIn addition to resource records defined in a [[zone file]], the domain name system also defines several request types that are used only in communication with other DNS nodes (''on the wire''), such as when performing zone transfers (AXFR/IXFR) or for [[EDNS]] (OPT).\n\n===Wildcard DNS records===\nThe domain name system supports [[wildcard DNS record]]s which specify names that start with the ''asterisk label'', '*', e.g., *.example.<ref name=rfc1034/><ref name=rfc4592>RFC 4592, ''The Role of Wildcards in the Domain Name System'', E. Lewis (July 2006)</ref> DNS records belonging to wildcard domain names specify rules for generating resource records within a single DNS zone by substituting whole labels with matching components of the query name, including any specified descendants.\nFor example, in the DNS zone ''x.example'', the following configuration specifies that all subdomains, including subdomains of subdomains, of ''x.example'' use the mail exchanger ''a.x.example''. The records for ''a.x.example'' are needed to specify the mail exchanger. As this has the result of excluding this domain name and its subdomains from the wildcard matches, all subdomains of ''a.x.example'' must be defined in a separate wildcard statement.\n\nThe role of wildcard records was refined in RFC 4592, because the original definition in RFC 1034 was incomplete and resulted in misinterpretations by implementers.<ref name=\"rfc4592\" />\n\n==Protocol extensions==\nThe original DNS protocol had limited provisions for extension with new features. In 1999, Paul Vixie published in RFC 2671 an extension mechanism, called [[Extension mechanisms for DNS]] (EDNS) that introduced optional protocol elements without increasing overhead when not in use. This was accomplished through the OPT pseudo-resource record that only exists in wire transmissions of the protocol, but not in any zone files. Initial extensions were also suggested (EDNS0), such as increasing the DNS message size in UDP datagrams.\n\n==Dynamic zone updates==\n[[Dynamic DNS|Dynamic DNS updates]] use the UPDATE DNS opcode to add or remove resource records dynamically from a zone database maintained on an authoritative DNS server. The feature is described in RFC 2136. This facility is useful to register network clients into the DNS when they boot or become otherwise available on the network. Since a booting client may be assigned a different IP address each time from a [[DHCP]] server, it is not possible to provide static DNS assignments for such clients.\n\n==Security issues==\nOriginally, security concerns were not major design considerations for DNS software or any software for deployment on the early Internet, as the network was not open for participation by the general public. However, the expansion of the Internet into the commercial sector in the 1990s changed the requirements for security measures to protect data integrity and user authentication.\n\nSeveral vulnerability issues were discovered and exploited by malicious users. One such issue is [[DNS cache poisoning]], in which data is distributed to caching resolvers under the pretense of being an authoritative origin server, thereby polluting the data store with potentially false information and long expiration times (time-to-live). Subsequently, legitimate application requests may be redirected to network hosts operated with malicious intent.\n\nDNS responses are traditionally not cryptographically signed, leading to many attack possibilities; the [[Domain Name System Security Extensions]] (DNSSEC) modify DNS to add support for cryptographically signed responses. [[DNSCurve]] has been proposed as an alternative to DNSSEC. Other extensions, such as [[TSIG]], add support for cryptographic authentication between trusted peers and are commonly used to authorize zone transfer or dynamic update operations.\n\nSome domain names may be used to achieve spoofing effects. For example, {{not a typo|paypal.com}} and paypa1.com are different names, yet users may be unable to distinguish them in a graphical user interface depending on the user's chosen [[typeface]]. In many fonts the letter ''l'' and the numeral ''1'' look very similar or even identical. This problem is acute in systems that support [[internationalized domain name]]s, since many character codes in [[ISO 10646]] may appear identical on typical computer screens. This vulnerability is occasionally exploited in [[phishing]].<ref>APWG. \"Global Phishing Survey: Domain Name Use and Trends in 1H2010.\" [http://www.apwg.org/reports/APWG_GlobalPhishingSurvey_1H2010.pdf 10/15/2010 apwg.org]</ref>\n\nTechniques such as [[forward-confirmed reverse DNS]] can also be used to help validate DNS results.\n\n==Domain name registration==\nThe right to use a domain name is delegated by domain name registrars which are accredited by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN) or other organizations such as [[OpenNIC]], that are charged with overseeing the name and number systems of the Internet. In addition to ICANN, each top-level domain (TLD) is maintained and serviced technically by an administrative organization, operating a registry. A ''registry'' is responsible for operating the database of names within its authoritative zone, although the term is most often used for TLDs.  A ''registrant'' is a person or organization who asked for domain registration.<ref name=\"rfc7719\"/>  The registry receives registration information from each domain name ''registrar'', which is authorized (accredited) to assign names in the corresponding zone and publishes the information using the [[WHOIS]] protocol.  As of 2015, usage of [[Registration Data Access Protocol|RDAP]] is being considered.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2015-12-03-en |title=Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) Operational Profile for gTLD Registries and Registrars |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=3 December 2015 |publisher=[[ICANN]] |access-date=18 December 2015 }}</ref>\n\nICANN publishes the complete list of TLDs, TLD registries, and domain name registrars. Registrant information associated with domain names is maintained in an online database accessible with the WHOIS service. For most of the more than 290 [[country code top-level domain]]s (ccTLDs), the domain registries maintain the WHOIS (Registrant, name servers, expiration dates, etc.) information. For instance, [[DENIC]], Germany NIC, holds the DE domain data. Since about 2001, most [[Generic top-level domain]] (gTLD) registries have adopted this so-called ''thick'' registry approach, i.e. keeping the WHOIS data in central registries instead of registrar databases.\n\nFor COM and NET domain names, a ''thin'' registry model is used. The domain registry (e.g., [[VeriSign]]) holds basic WHOIS data (i.e., registrar and name servers, etc.) One can find the detailed WHOIS (registrant, name servers, expiry dates, etc.) at the registrars.\n\nSome domain name registries, often called ''network information centers'' (NIC), also function as registrars to end-users. The major generic top-level domain registries, such as for the  domains COM, NET, ORG, INFO, use a registry-registrar model consisting of many domain name registrars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.verisign.com/en_US/domain-names/domain-registrar/index.xhtml|title=Find a Registrar|publisher=VeriSign, Inc.|accessdate=18 December 2015}}</ref> In this method of management, the registry only manages the domain name database and the relationship with the registrars. The ''registrants'' (users of a domain name) are customers of the registrar, in some cases through additional layers of resellers.\n\n==RFC documents==\n<!-- NOTE:\nListed are RFCs that are still current, and generally not better suited in other articles.
