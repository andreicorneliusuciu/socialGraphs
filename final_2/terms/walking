In this model the head keeps the same level at all times, whereas the hip follows a sine curve.]]\n'''Walking''' (also known as '''ambulation''') is one of the main [[gait]]s of [[animal locomotion|locomotion]] among legged animals, and is typically slower than [[running]] and other gaits.  Walking is defined by an 'inverted pendulum' gait in which the body vaults over the stiff limb or limbs with each step. This applies regardless of the number of limbs - even [[arthropod]]s, with six, eight or more limbs, walk.\n\n==Difference from running==\n{{main article|Running}}\n{{See also|Jogging}}\n[[File:1987WorldCupTrials.jpg|thumb|325px|Racewalkers at the World Cup Trials in 1987]]\n\nThe word ''walk'' is descended from the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''wealcan'' \"to roll\". In [[human]]s and other [[biped]]s, walking is generally distinguished from [[running]] in that only one foot at a time leaves contact with the ground and there is a period of double-support. In contrast, running begins when both feet are off the ground with each step. This distinction has the status of a formal requirement in [[Racewalking|competitive walking]] events. For [[quadruped]]al species, there are numerous [[gait]]s which may be termed walking or running, and distinctions based upon the presence or absence of a suspended phase or the number of feet in contact any time do not yield mechanically correct classification.<ref name=\"Bie\">{{cite book |last=Biewener |first=A. A. |year=2003 |title=Animal Locomotion |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=USA |ISBN= 978-0-19-850022-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMaN9pk8QJAC&dq=biomechanics+biewener&source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=}}</ref>  The most effective method to distinguish walking from [[running]] is to measure the height of a person's [[centre of mass]] using [[motion capture]] or a [[force plate]] at midstance. During walking, the centre of mass reaches a maximum height at midstance, while during running, it is then at a minimum. This distinction, however, only holds true for locomotion over level or approximately level ground. For walking up grades above 9%, this distinction no longer holds for some individuals. Definitions based on the percentage of the stride during which a foot is in contact with the ground (averaged across all feet) of greater than 50% contact corresponds well with identification of 'inverted pendulum' mechanics and are indicative of walking for animals with any number of limbs, although this definition is incomplete.<ref name=\"Bie\"/> Running humans and animals may have contact periods greater than 50% of a gait cycle when rounding corners, running uphill or carrying loads.\n\nSpeed is another factor that distinguishes walking from running. Although walking speeds can vary greatly depending on many factors such as height, weight, age, terrain, surface, load, culture, effort, and fitness, the average human [[Preferred Walking Speed|walking speed]] is about 5.0 kilometres per hour (km/h), or about 3.1 miles per hour (mph).

This growing emphasis on walking has arisen because people walk less nowadays than previously. In the UK; a Department of Transport report<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/personal/factsheets/walkingfactsheet.pdf |title=Statistics - Department for Transport |publisher=Dft.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-22}}</ref> found that between 1995/97 and 2005 the average number of walk trips per person fell by 16%, from 292 to 245 per year. Many professionals in local authorities and the NHS are employed to halt this decline by ensuring that the built environment allows people to walk and that there are walking opportunities available to them. Professionals working to encourage walking come mainly from six sectors: health, transport, environment, schools, sport and recreation, and urban design.\n\nOne programme to encourage walking is \"The Walking the Way to Health Initiative\", organized by the British walkers association The [[Ramblers]], which is the largest volunteer led walking scheme in the [[United Kingdom]]. Volunteers are trained to lead free Health Walks from community venues such as libraries and doctors' surgeries. The scheme has trained over 35,000 volunteers and have over 500 schemes operating across the UK, with thousands of people walking every week.<ref>[http://www.walkingforhealth.org.uk] Walking for Health.</ref> A new organization called \"Walk England\" launched a web site in June 2008 to provide these professionals with evidence, advice and examples of success stories of how to encourage communities to walk more. The site has a social networking aspect to allow professionals and the public to ask questions, post news and events and communicate with others in their area about walking, as well as a \"walk now\" option to find out what walks are available in each region. Similar organizations exist in other countries and recently a \"Walking Summit\" was held in the USA.

Some scrambling takes place on narrow exposed ridges where more attention to balance will be required than in normal walking\n* [[Snow shoe]]ing\u2014A snowshoe is footwear for walking over the snow. Snowshoes work by distributing the weight of the person over a larger area so that the person's foot does not sink completely into the snow, a quality called \"flotation\". It is often said by snowshoers that if you can walk, you can snowshoe. This is true in optimal conditions, but snowshoeing properly requires some slight adjustments to walking. The method of walking is to lift the shoes slightly and slide the inner edges over each other, thus avoiding the unnatural and fatiguing \"straddle-gait\" that would otherwise be necessary. A snowshoer must be willing to roll his or her feet slightly as well. An exaggerated stride works best when starting out, particularly with larger or traditional shoes.\n* Beach Walking is a sport that is based on walk on the sand of the [[beach]]. Beach Walking can be developed on compact sand or non-compact sand. It is an important variant of [[Beach Run]]. There are Beach Walking competitions on non-compact sand. And there are world records of Beach Walking on non-compact sand in Multiday distances. Beach Walking has a specific technique of walk.\n* [[Nordic walking]] is a physical activity and a sport, which is performed with specially designed [[walking pole]]s similar to [[ski pole]]s.  Compared to regular walking, Nordic walking (also called pole walking) involves applying force to the poles with each stride. Nordic walkers use more of their entire body (with greater intensity) and receive fitness building stimulation not present in normal walking for the chest, lats, triceps, biceps, shoulder, abdominals, spinal and other core muscles that may result in significant increases in heart rate at a given pace.<ref>Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise VOL. 27, NO. 4 April1995:607-11</ref> Nordic walking has been estimated as producing up to a 46% increase in energy consumption, compared to walking without poles.<ref>Cooper Institute, ''Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sports'', 2002</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=  Field testing of physiological responses associated with Nordic Walking|date=2013-03-25 |pmid=12230336 | doi=10.1080/02701367.2002.10609023 |volume=73 |journal=Res Q Exerc Sport |pages=296\u2013300 |vauthors=Church TS, Earnest CP, Morss GM }}</ref>\n*[[Pedestrianism]] is a sport that developed during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and was a popular spectator sport in the [[British Isles]]. By the end of the 18th century, and especially with the growth of the popular press, feats of foot travel over great distances (similar to a modern [[Ultramarathon]]) gained attention, and were labeled \"pedestrianism\". Interest in the sport, and the wagering which accompanied it, spread to the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Australia]] in the 19th century. By the end of the 19th century, Pedestrianism was largely displaced by the rise in modern [[spectator sport]]s and by controversy involving rules, which limited its appeal as a source of wagering and led to its inclusion in the amateur athletics movement. Pedestrianism was first codified in the last half of the 19th century, evolving into what would become [[racewalking]], By the mid 19th century, competitors were often expected to extend their legs straight at least once in their stride, and obey what was called the \"fair heel and toe\" rule. This rule, the source of modern racewalking, was a vague commandment that the toe of one foot could not leave the ground before the heel of the next foot touched down. This said, rules were customary and changed with competition. Racers were usually allowed to jog in order to fend off cramps, and it was distance, not code, which determined gait for longer races. Newspaper reports suggest that \"[[Jogging|trotting]]\" was common in events.<ref>Phil Howell (1986).</ref>\n* [[Power walking]] or speed walking is the act of walking with a speed at the upper end of the natural range for walking gait, typically 7 to 9&nbsp;km/h (4.5 to 5.5&nbsp;mph). To qualify as power walking as opposed to [[jogging]] or running, at least one foot must be in contact with the ground at all times. (See also [[Fitwalking]]).\n* [[Racewalking]] is a long-distance [[Athletics (sport)|athletic]] event. Although it is a foot race, it is different from [[running]] in that one foot must appear to be in contact with the ground at all times. Stride length is reduced, so to achieve competitive speeds, racewalkers must attain [[Cadence (gait)|cadence]] rates comparable to those achieved by [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] 800-meter runners,<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Olympics/2012/0803/Wait-that-s-an-Olympic-event]</ref> and they must do so for hours at a time since the Olympic events are the [[20 kilometres race walk|20 km (12.4&nbsp;mi) race walk]] (men and women)  and [[50 kilometres race walk|50 km (31 mi) race walk]] (men only), and [[50 miles race walk|50 mile (80.5&nbsp;km)]] events are also held. '''See also''' Pedestrianism above.\n\n== Biomechanics ==\n[[File:Blender3D NormalWalkCycle.gif|thumb|120px|Simple walk-cycle]]\nHuman walking is accomplished with a strategy called the [[double pendulum]]. During forward motion, the leg that leaves the ground swings forward from the hip. This sweep is the first pendulum. Then the leg strikes the ground with the heel and rolls through to the toe in a motion described as an inverted pendulum. The motion of the two legs is coordinated so that one foot or the other is always in contact with the ground. The process of walking recovers approximately sixty per cent of the energy used due to pendulum dynamics and ground reaction force.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/health/HealthRepublish_232296.htm\n | title = Walk without waste | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Online Index]]\n | date = January 2001 | accessdate = August 2009\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://web.deu.edu.tr/mechatronics/TR/webpagedesignbipedal/humangait.pdf\n | title = Investigation of Bipedal Human Gait Dynamics and Knee Motion Control\n | first1 = Erol | last1 = Uyar | first2 = \u00d6zg\u00fcn | last2 = Baser | first3 = Recep | last3 = Baci | first4 = Engin | last4 = \u00d6z\u00e7ivici\n | publisher = Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University - Faculty of Engineering Department of Mechanical Engineering | location = Izmir, Turkey\n | date = before 2003 | accessdate = August 2009\n}}</ref>\n\nWalking differs from a [[running]] [[gait]] in a number of ways. The most obvious is that during walking one leg always stays on the ground while the other is swinging. In running there is typically a [[Ballistics|ballistic]] phase where the runner is airborne with both feet in the air (for bipedals).\n\nAnother difference concerns the movement of the [[centre of mass]] of the body. In walking the body \"vaults\" over the leg on the ground, raising the centre of mass to its highest point as the leg passes the vertical, and dropping it to the lowest as the legs are spread apart. Essentially [[kinetic energy]] of forward motion is constantly being traded for a rise in [[potential energy]]. This is reversed in running where the centre of mass is at its lowest as the leg is vertical. This is because the impact of landing from the ballistic phase is absorbed by bending the leg and consequently storing energy in [[muscles]] and [[tendons]]. In running there is a conversion between kinetic, potential, and [[elastic energy]].\n\nThere is an absolute limit on an individual's speed of walking (without special techniques such as those employed in [[speed walking]]) due to the upwards acceleration of the centre of mass during a stride - if it's greater than the acceleration due to gravity the person will become airborne as they vault over the leg on the ground. Typically however, animals switch to a run at a lower speed than this due to energy efficiencies.\n\n== A leisure activity ==<!--this is a link anchor, please check what links here if you change it-->\n[[File:Walking.jpg|thumb|Walking in [[Shilda]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].]]\n{{main article|Hiking}}\nMany people enjoy walking as a recreation in the mainly urban modern world, and it is one of the best forms of [[exercise]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Ramblers |url=http://www.ramblers.org.uk/go-walking/advice-for-walkers/walking-and-your-health.aspx |title=Walking benefits |publisher=Ramblers.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-22}}</ref> For some, walking is a way to enjoy nature and the outdoors; and for others the physical, sporting and endurance aspect is more important.\n\nThere are a variety of different kinds of walking, including [[bushwalking]], [[racewalking]], [[Beach Run|beach walking]], [[hillwalking]], [[volksmarching]], [[Nordic walking]], [[trekking]] and [[hiking]]. Some people prefer to walk indoors on a [[treadmill]], or in a gym, and fitness walkers and others may use a [[pedometer]] to count their steps. [[Hiking]] is the usual word used in [[Canada]], the United States and [[South Africa]] for long vigorous walks; similar walks are called tramps in New Zealand, or hill walking or just walking in [[Australia]], the UK and the Irish Republic. Australians also bushwalk. In English-speaking parts of North America the term walking is used for short walks, especially in towns and cities. [[Snow shoe]]ing is walking in snow; a slightly different [[gait]] is required compared with regular walking.\n\nIn terms of tourism the possibilities range from guided [[walking tours]] in cities, to organized [[trekking]] holidays in the [[Himalayas]]. In the UK the term walking tour also refers to a multi-day walk or hike undertaken by a group or individual. Well-organized systems of trails exist in many other European counties, as well as [[Canada]], United States, [[New Zealand]], and [[Nepal]]. Systems of lengthy [[waymark]]ed walking trails now stretch across [[Europe]] from [[Norway]] to [[Turkey]], [[Portugal]] to [[Cyprus]].<ref>See [[European long-distance paths]]</ref> Many also walk the traditional [[Pilgrimage|pilgrim routes]], of which the most famous is El Camino de [[Santiago]], The [[Way of St. James]].\n\nNumerous walking festivals and other walking events take place each year in many countries. The world's largest multi-day walking event is the [[International Four Days Marches Nijmegen]] in the [[Netherlands]]. The \"Vierdaagse\" (Dutch for \"Four day Event\") is an annual walk that has taken place since 1909; it has been based at [[Nijmegen]] since 1916. Depending on age group and category, walkers have to walk 30, 40 or 50 kilometers each day for four days.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Originally a military event with a few civilians, it now is a mainly civilian event. Numbers have risen in recent years, with over 40,000 now taking part, including about 5,000 military personnel.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Due to crowds on the route, since 2004 the organizers have limited the number of participants. In the USA there is the annual [[Labor Day]] walk on [[Mackinac Bridge]], [[Michigan]], which draws over 60,000 participants; it is the largest single-day walking event;{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} while the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]] Walk in [[Maryland]] draws over 50,000 participants each year.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} There are also various walks organised as [[Charitable organisation|charity]] events, with walkers sponsored for a specific cause.

In the United States, the [[active living]] network is an example of a concerted effort to develop communities more friendly to walking and other physical activities.\n\nAn example of such efforts to make urban development more pedestrian friendly is the [[pedestrian village]]. This is a compact, pedestrian-oriented neighborhood or town, with a mixed-use village center, that follows the tenets of [[New Pedestrianism]].<ref name=\"New Pedestrianism information\">[http://www.pedestrianvillages.com/ New Pedestrianism information]</ref><ref>[http://www.newpedestrianism.com/newped/cnu-presentation.html/ New Urbanism and New Pedestrianism in the 21st Century]</ref> Shared-use lanes for [[pedestrians]] and those using [[bicycles]], [[Segways]], [[wheelchairs]], and other small rolling conveyances that do not use [[internal combustion engines]]. Generally, these lanes are in front of the houses and businesses, and streets for motor vehicles are always at the rear. Some pedestrian villages might be nearly car-free with cars either hidden below the buildings or on the periphery of the village. [[Venice, Italy]] is essentially a pedestrian village with canals. The canal district in [[Venice, California]], on the other hand, combines the front lane/rear street approach with canals and walkways, or just walkways.<ref name=\"New Pedestrianism information\"/><ref name=\"laborsofhercules\">Michael E.

Non-motorised transport modes such as walking, but also [[cycling]], small-wheeled transport (skates, skateboards, push scooters and hand carts) or wheelchair travel are often key elements of successfully encouraging clean urban transport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eu-portal.net/material/material2.phtml?sprache=en&kt=kt11 |title=Non Motorised Transport, Teaching and Learning Material |publisher=Eu-portal.net |date= |accessdate=2012-08-22}}</ref> A large variety of case studies and good practices (from European cities and some worldwide examples) that promote and stimulate walking as a means of transportation in cities can be found at [[Eltis]], Europe's portal for local transport.<ref>[http://www.eltis.org European Local Transport Information Service] ([[ELTIS]]) provides case studies concerning walking as a local transport concept</ref>\n\nThe development of specific rights of way with appropriate infrastructure can promote increased participation and enjoyment of walking. Examples of types of investment include [[pedestrian mall]]s, and [[foreshoreway]]s such as [[oceanway]]s and also river walks.\n\nThe first purpose-built [[Pedestrian zone|pedestrian street]] in Europe is the [[Lijnbaan]] in [[Rotterdam]], opened in 1953. The first pedestrianised shopping centre in the [[United Kingdom]] was in [[Stevenage]] in 1959. A [[List of car-free places|large number of European towns and cities]] have made part of their centres car-free since the early 1960s. These are often accompanied by [[car park]]s on the edge of the pedestrianised zone, and, in the larger cases, [[park and ride]] schemes. Central [[Copenhagen]] is one of the largest and oldest: It was converted from car traffic into pedestrian zone in 1962.\n\n== In robotics ==\n{{Main article|Robot locomotion}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}\nThe first successful attempts at walking [[robot]]s tended to have six legs. The number of legs was reduced as microprocessor technology advanced, and there are now a number of robots that can walk on two legs.  One, for example, is [[ASIMO]].  Although robots have taken great strides in advancement, they still don't walk nearly as well as human beings as they often need to keep their [[knee]]s bent permanently in order to improve stability.\n\nIn 2009, Japanese roboticist [[Tomotaka Takahashi]] developed a robot that can jump three inches off the ground. The robot, named [[Ropid]], is capable of getting up, walking, running, and jumping.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-10387001-1.html|title= Ropid the robot can walk, run, and hop|publisher=CBS Interactive  |accessdate=2012-06-19}}</ref>\n\n==Animals==\n{{main article|Terrestrial locomotion}}\n{{See also|Gait}}\n[[File:Penguins walking -Moltke Harbour, South Georgia, British overseas territory, UK-8.jpg|right|thumb|Two [[king penguins]] and one [[gentoo penguin]] walking on a beach on [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]], British overseas territory]]\n\n===Horses===\n{{main article|Horse gait}}\n[[Image:Muybridge horse walking animated.gif|thumb|The walk, a four-beat gait]]\nThe walk is a four-beat gait that averages about {{convert|4|mph|km/h}}. When walking, a horse's legs follow this sequence: left hind leg, left front leg, right hind leg, right front leg, in a regular 1-2-3-4 beat. At the walk, the horse will always have one foot raised and the other three feet on the ground, save for a brief moment when weight is being transferred from one foot to another. A horse moves its head and neck in a slight up and down motion that helps maintain balance.<ref name=Harris33>Harris, Susan E. ''Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement'' New York: Howell Book House 1993 ISBN 0-87605-955-8 pp. 32\u201333</ref>\n\nIdeally, the advancing rear hoof oversteps the spot where the previously advancing front hoof touched the ground. The more the rear hoof oversteps, the smoother and more comfortable the walk becomes. Individual horses and different [[List of horse breeds|breeds]] vary in the smoothness of their walk. However, a rider will almost always feel some degree of gentle side-to-side motion in the horse's hips as each hind leg reaches forward.\n\nThe fastest \"walks\" with a four-beat footfall pattern are actually the lateral forms of [[ambling]] gaits such as the running walk, singlefoot, and similar rapid but smooth intermediate speed gaits.  If a horse begins to speed up and lose a regular four-beat cadence to its gait, the horse is no longer walking, but is beginning to either [[Horse gait#Trot|trot]] or pace.\n\n===Elephants===\n[[File:Elephant Walking animated.gif|thumb|right|An Asian elephant walking]]\n\n[[Elephants]] can move both forwards and backwards, but cannot [[trot]], [[jumping|jump]], or [[Horse gait|gallop]]. They use only two gaits when moving on land, the walk and a faster gait similar to running.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Shoshani | first1 = J. | last2 = Walter | first2 = R.
