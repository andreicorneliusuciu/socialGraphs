PowerPC, as an evolving instruction set, has since 2006 been named [[Power Architecture#Specifications|Power ISA]], while the old name naturally lives on, as a legacy [[trademark]] for some implementations of [[Power Architecture]] based processors, and in software package identifiers.\n\nPowerPC was the cornerstone of AIM's [[PReP]] and [[Common Hardware Reference Platform]] initiatives in the 1990s. Originally intended for [[personal computer]]s, the architecture is well known for being used by Apple's [[Power Macintosh]], [[PowerBook]], [[iMac]], [[iBook]], and [[Xserve]] lines from 1994 until 2006, when [[Apple's transition to Intel processors|Apple migrated to Intel's x86]]. It has since become niche in personal computers, but remain popular as [[embedded system|embedded]] and high-performance processors. Its use in video game consoles and embedded applications provided an array of uses. In addition, PowerPC CPUs are still used in [[AmigaOne]] and third party [[AmigaOS 4]] personal computers.\n\nPowerPC is largely based on IBM's earlier [[IBM POWER Instruction Set Architecture|POWER instruction set architecture]], and retains a high level of compatibility with it; the architectures have remained close enough that the same programs and [[operating system]]s will run on both if some care is taken in preparation; newer chips in the [[IBM POWER microprocessors|POWER series]] use the Power ISA.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of RISC began with IBM's [[IBM 801|801]] research project, on which [[John Cocke]] was the lead developer, where he developed the concepts of [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] in 1975\u201378. 801-based microprocessors were used in a number of IBM embedded products, eventually becoming the 16-register [[ROMP]] processor used in the [[IBM RT]]. The RT was a rapid design implementing the RISC architecture. Between the years of 1982\u20131984 IBM started a project to build the fastest microprocessor on the market; this new [[64-bit]] architecture became referred to as the ''America Project'' throughout its development cycle which lasted for approximately 5\u20136 years. The result was the [[IBM POWER Instruction Set Architecture|POWER instruction set architecture]], introduced with the [[RS/6000|RISC System/6000]] in early 1990.\n\nThe [[POWER1|original POWER microprocessor]], one of the first [[superscalar]] RISC implementations, was a high performance, multi-chip design. IBM soon realized that a single-chip microprocessor was needed in order to scale its RS/6000 line from lower-end to high-end machines. Work on a one-chip POWER microprocessor, designated the RSC ([[RISC Single Chip]]) began. In early 1991, IBM realized its design could potentially become a high-volume microprocessor used across the industry.\n\n=== Apple and Motorola involvement ===\nIBM approached Apple with the goal of collaborating on the development of a family of single-chip microprocessors based on the POWER architecture. Soon after, Apple, being one of Motorola's largest customers of desktop-class microprocessors,<ref>{{cite web | title = Tech Files Columns, 1987-1990 | url = http://www.joelwest.org/Press/TechFiles.html#01.03.89}}</ref> asked Motorola to join the discussions due to their long relationship, its more extensive experience with manufacturing high-volume microprocessors than IBM, and to form a second source for the microprocessors. This three-way collaboration became known as [[AIM alliance]], for '''A'''pple, '''I'''BM, '''M'''otorola.\n\nIn 1991, the PowerPC was just one facet of a larger alliance among these three companies. At the time, most of the personal computer industry was shipping systems based on the Intel 80386 and 80486 chips, which had a [[Complex instruction set computing|CISC]] architecture, and development of the [[P5 (microarchitecture)|Pentium]] processor was well underway. The PowerPC chip was one of several joint ventures involving the three, in their efforts to counter the growing Microsoft-Intel dominance of personal computing.\n\nFor Motorola, POWER looked like an unbelievable deal. It allowed them to sell a widely tested and powerful RISC CPU for little design cash on their own part. It also maintained ties with an important customer, Apple, and seemed to offer the possibility of adding IBM too, who might buy smaller versions from Motorola instead of making its own.\n\nAt this point Motorola already had its own RISC design in the form of the [[Motorola 88000|88000]] which was doing poorly in the market. Motorola was doing well with their [[Motorola 68000|68000]] family and the majority of the funding was focused on this. The 88000 effort was somewhat starved for resources.\n\nHowever, the 88000 was already in production; [[Data General]] was shipping 88000 machines and Apple already had 88000 prototype machines running. The 88000 had also achieved a number of embedded design wins in telecom applications. If the new POWER one-chip version could be made bus-compatible at a hardware level with the 88000, that would allow both Apple and Motorola to bring machines to market far faster since they would not have to redesign their board architecture.\n\nThe result of these various requirements was the PowerPC ('''''P'''erformance '''C'''omputing'') specification. The differences between the earlier POWER instruction set and PowerPC is outlined in Appendix E of the manual for PowerPC ISA v.2.02.<ref>[http://moss.csc.ncsu.edu/~mueller/cluster/ps3/SDK3.0/docs/arch/PPC_Vers202_Book1_public.pdf PowerPC User Instruction Set Architecture Book I, version 2.02]</ref>\n\n=== Operating systems ===\nWhen the first PowerPC products reached the market, they were met with enthusiasm. In addition to Apple, both IBM and the [[Motorola Computer Group]] offered systems built around the processors. [[Microsoft]] released [[Windows NT 3.51]] for the architecture, which was used in Motorola's PowerPC servers, and [[Sun Microsystems]] offered a version of its [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] OS. IBM ported its [[IBM AIX|AIX]] [[Unix]] and planned a release of [[OS/2]]. Throughout the mid-1990s, PowerPC processors achieved [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] test scores that matched or exceeded those of the fastest x86 CPUs.\n\nUltimately, demand for the new architecture on the desktop never truly materialized. Windows, OS/2 and Sun customers, faced with the lack of application software for the PowerPC, almost universally ignored the chip. The PowerPC versions of Solaris, OS/2, and Windows were discontinued after only a brief period on the market. Only on the Macintosh, due to Apple's persistence, did the PowerPC gain traction. To Apple, the performance of the PowerPC was a bright spot in the face of increased competition from Windows 95 and Windows NT-based PCs.\n\nIn parallel with the alliance between IBM and Motorola, both companies had development efforts underway internally. The PowerQUICC line was the result of this work inside Motorola. The 4xx series of embedded processors was underway inside IBM. The IBM embedded processor business grew to nearly 100 million dollars in revenue and attracted hundreds of customers.\n\n=== Breakup of AIM ===\nHowever, toward the close of the decade, manufacturing issues began plaguing the AIM alliance in much the same way they did Motorola, which consistently pushed back deployments of new processors for Apple and other vendors: first from Motorola in the 1990s with the PowerPC 7xx and 74xx processors, and IBM with the 64-bit PowerPC 970 processor in 2003. In 2004, Motorola exited the chip manufacturing business by spinning off its semiconductor business as an independent company called [[Freescale Semiconductor]]. Around the same time, IBM exited the 32-bit embedded processor market by selling its line of PowerPC products to [[Applied Micro Circuits Corporation]] (AMCC) and focusing on 64-bit chip designs, while maintaining its commitment of PowerPC CPUs toward game machine makers such as [[Nintendo]]'s [[GameCube]] and [[Wii]], [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox 360]], of which the latter two both use 64-bit processors. In 2005 Apple announced they would no longer use PowerPC processors in their Apple Macintosh computers, favoring [[Intel]]-produced processors instead, citing the performance limitations of the chip for future personal computer hardware specifically related to heat generation and energy usage, as well as the inability of IBM to move the 970 processor to the 3&nbsp;GHz range. The IBM-Freescale alliance was replaced by an [[open standards]] body called Power.org. Power.org operates under the governance of the IEEE with IBM continuing to use and evolve the PowerPC processor on game consoles and Freescale Semiconductor focusing solely on embedded devices.\n\n[[File:PowerISA-evolution.svg|thumb|A schematic showing the evolution of the different [[IBM POWER Instruction Set Architecture|POWER]], PowerPC and [[Power Architecture|Power]] [[Instruction set architecture|ISAs]]]]\nIBM continues to develop PowerPC microprocessor cores for use in their [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC) offerings. Many high volume applications embed PowerPC cores.\n\nThe PowerPC specification is now handled by Power.org where IBM, Freescale, and AMCC are members. PowerPC, Cell and POWER processors are now jointly marketed as the [[Power Architecture]]. Power.org released a unified ISA, combining POWER and PowerPC ISAs into the new Power ISA v.2.03 specification and a new reference platform for servers called PAPR (Power Architecture Platform Reference).\n\n{{as of|2015}}, IBM's [[IBM POWER microprocessors|POWER microprocessors]], which implement the Power ISA, are used by IBM in their [[IBM Power Systems]], running [[IBM i]], [[AIX]], and [[Linux]].\n\n=== Generations ===\nMany PowerPC designs are named and labeled by their apparent technology generation. That began with the \"G3\" which was an internal project name inside [[AIM alliance|AIM]] for the development of what would become the [[PowerPC 7xx|PowerPC 750 family]].<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=584742&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel3%2F4463%2F12649%2F00584742.pdf%3Farnumber%3D584742 A G3 PowerPC superscalar low-power microprocessor]</ref> Apple popularized the term \"G3\" when they introduced [[Power Macintosh G3 beige|Power Mac G3]] and [[PowerBook G3]] at an event at 10 November 1997. Motorola and Apple liked the moniker and used the term \"G4\" for the 7400 family introduced in 1998<ref>[http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~moshovos/ACA07/lecturenotes/ppcg4%2520(mpr).pdf G4 Is First PowerPC With AltiVec - Due Mid-1999, Motorola\u2019s Next Chip Aims at Macintosh, Networking]</ref><ref>[http://www.nxp.com/files/product/doc/G4WP.pdf PowerPC G4 Architecture White Paper]</ref> and the [[Power Mac G4]] in 1999.\n\nAt the time of the G4 was launched, Motorola categorized all their PowerPC models (former, current and future) according to what generation they adhered to, even renaming the older 603e core \"G2\". Motorola had a [[Motorola G5 project|G5 project]] that never came to fruition, but the name stuck and Apple reused it when the [[PowerPC 970|970 family]] launched in 2003 even if those were designed and built by IBM.\n\n;PowerPC generations according to Motorola, ca 2000.<ref>[http://www.nxp.com/files/32bit/doc/fact_sheet/PPCCPUINTFACT.pdf Fact Sheet - Motorola PowerPC Processor]</ref>\n:G1 - The [[PowerPC 600#PowerPC 601|601]], [[MPC5xx|500]] and [[PowerQUICC#PowerQUICC I|800]] family processors\n:G2 - The [[PowerPC 600#PowerPC 602|602]], [[PowerPC 600#PowerPC 603|603]], [[PowerPC 600#PowerPC 604|604]], [[PowerPC 600#PowerPC 620|620]], [[PowerQUICC#PowerQUICC II|8200]] and [[PowerPC 5000|5000]] families\n:G3 - The [[PowerPC 7xx|750]] and [[PowerQUICC#PowerQUICC II Pro|8300]] families\n:G4 - The [[PowerPC G4|7400]] and 8400* families\n:G5 - The [[Motorola G5 project|7500*]] and [[PowerQUICC#PowerQUICC III|8500]] families (Motorola didn't use the G5 moniker after Apple usurped the name)\n:G6 - The [[PowerPC e700|7600*]]\n:''*) These designs didn't become real products.''\n\n== Design features ==\n{{Power Architecture}}\n\nThe PowerPC is designed along [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] principles, and allows for a [[superscalar]] implementation. Versions of the design exist in both 32-bit and 64-bit implementations. Starting with the basic POWER specification, the PowerPC added:\n*Support for operation in both big-[[endianness|endian]] and little-endian modes; the PowerPC can switch from one mode to the other at run-time (see [[PowerPC#Endian modes|below]]). This feature is not supported in the [[PowerPC 970]].\n*Single-precision forms of some [[floating point]] instructions, in addition to double-precision forms\n*Additional floating point instructions at the behest of Apple\n*A complete 64-bit specification that is backward compatible with the 32-bit mode\n*A [[fused multiply\u2013add]]\n*A [[paged memory management]] architecture which is used extensively in server and PC systems.\n*Addition of a new memory management architecture called Book-E, replacing the conventional paged memory management architecture for embedded applications. Book-E is application software compatible with existing PowerPC implementations, but needs minor changes to the operating system.\n\nSome instructions present in the POWER instruction set were deemed too complex and were removed in the PowerPC architecture. Some removed instructions could be emulated by the [[operating system]] if necessary. The removed instructions are:\n*[[Conditional moves]]\n*Load and store instructions for the quad-precision floating-point data type\n*String instructions.\n\n=== Endian modes ===<!-- This section is linked from [[PowerPC]] -->\n\nMost PowerPC chips switch endianness via a bit in the MSR ([[machine state register]]), with a second bit provided to allow the OS to run with a different endianness. Accesses to the \"[[inverted page table]]\" (a hash table that functions as a [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] with off-chip storage) are always done in big-endian mode. The processor starts in big-endian mode.\n\nIn little-endian mode, the three lowest-order bits of the effective address are [[Exclusive or|exclusive-ORed]] with a three bit value selected by the length of the operand. This is enough to appear fully little-endian to normal software. An operating system will see a warped view of the world when it accesses external chips such as video and network hardware. Fixing this warped view requires that the motherboard perform an unconditional 64-bit byte swap on all data entering or leaving the processor. Endianness thus becomes a property of the motherboard. An OS that operates in little-endian mode on a big-endian motherboard must both swap bytes and undo the exclusive-OR when accessing little-endian chips.\n\n[[AltiVec]] operations, despite being 128-bit, are treated as if they were 64-bit. This allows for compatibility with little-endian motherboards that were designed prior to AltiVec.\n\nAn interesting side effect of this implementation is that a program can store a 64-bit value (the longest operand format) to memory while in one endian mode, switch modes, and read back the same 64-bit value without seeing a change of byte order. This will not be the case if the motherboard is switched at the same time.\n\n[[Mercury Computer Systems]] and [[Matrox]] ran the PowerPC in little-endian mode. This was done so that PowerPC devices serving as co-processors on PCI boards could share data structures with host computers based on [[x86]]. Both PCI and x86 are little-endian. OS/2 and Windows NT for PowerPC ran the processor in little-endian mode while Solaris, AIX and Linux ran in big endian.<ref>[http://www.os2museum.com/wp/os2-for-powerpc-tidbits/ OS/2 for PowerPC Tidbits]</ref>\n\nSome of IBM's embedded PowerPC chips use a per-page [[endianness]] bit. None of the previous applies to them.\n\n== Implementations ==\n[[File:IBM PPC604e 200.jpg|thumb|right|IBM [[PowerPC 600#PowerPC 604e|PowerPC 604e]] 200 MHz]]\n[[File:broadwaycpu.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Custom PowerPC CPU from the [[Nintendo]] [[Wii]] video game console]]\n[[File:XPC855TZP66D4 3K20A.jpg|thumb|right|The Freescale XPC855T Service Processor of a [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[SunFire]] V20z]]\n\nThe first implementation of the architecture was the [[PowerPC 601]], released in 1992, based on the RSC, implementing a hybrid of the [[POWER1]] and PowerPC instructions. This allowed the chip to be used by IBM in their existing POWER1-based platforms, although it also meant some slight pain when switching to the 2nd generation \"pure\" PowerPC designs. Apple continued work on a new line of Macintosh computers based on the chip, and eventually released them as the 601-based ''[[Power Macintosh]]'' on March 14, 1994.\n\nIBM also had a full line of PowerPC based desktops built and ready to ship; unfortunately, the operating system which IBM had intended to run on these desktops\u2014[[Microsoft]] [[Windows NT]]\u2014was not complete by early 1993, when the machines were ready for marketing. Accordingly, and further because IBM had developed animosity toward Microsoft, IBM decided to rewrite [[OS/2]] for the PowerPC. It took IBM two years to [[Rewrite (programming)|rewrite]] OS/2 for PowerPC, and by the time the operating system was ready, the market for OS/2 on PowerPC had evaporated. For this reason, the IBM PowerPC desktops did not ship, although the reference design (codenamed Sandalbow) based on the PowerPC 601 CPU was released as an RS/6000 model (''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]''\u2032s April 1994 issue included an extensive article about the Apple and IBM PowerPC desktops).\n\nApple, which also lacked a PowerPC based OS, took a different route. They rewrote the essential pieces of their [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]] operating system for the PowerPC architecture, and further wrote a [[Mac 68k emulator|680x0 emulator]] that could run [[Motorola 68000 family|68k]] based applications and the parts of the OS that had not been rewritten.\n\nThe second generation was \"pure\" and included the \"low end\" [[PowerPC 603]] and \"high end\" [[PowerPC 604]]. The 603 is notable due to its very low cost and power consumption. This was a deliberate design goal on Motorola's part, who used the 603 project to build the basic core for all future generations of PPC chips. Apple tried to use the 603 in a new laptop design but was unable due to the small 8&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]] level 1 cache. The 68000 emulator in the Mac OS could not fit in 8&nbsp;KiB and thus slowed the computer drastically. The [[PowerPC 600#PowerPC 603e and 603ev|603e]] solved this problem by having a 16&nbsp;KiB [[CPU cache|L1 cache]] which allowed the emulator to run efficiently.\n\nIn 1993, developers at IBM's [[Essex Junction, Vermont|Essex Junction, Burlington, Vermont]] facility started to work on a version of the PowerPC that would support the Intel [[x86]] instruction set directly on the CPU. While this was just one of several concurrent power architecture projects that IBM was working on, this chip began to be known inside IBM and by the media as the [[PowerPC 600#PowerPC 615|PowerPC 615]]. However, profitability concerns and rumors of performance issues in the switching between the x86 and native PowerPC instruction sets resulted in the project being canceled in 1995 after only a limited number of chips were produced for in-house testing. Despite the rumors, the switching process took only 5 cycles, or the amount of time needed for the processor to empty its instruction pipeline. Microsoft also aided the processor's demise by refusing to support the PowerPC mode.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/1998/10/01/microsoft_killed_the_powerpc/|title=Microsoft killed the PowerPC 615|publisher=The Register| date=October 1, 1998|accessdate=August 16, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe first 64-bit implementation was the [[PowerPC 620]], but it appears to have seen little use because Apple didn't want to buy it and because, with its large die area, it was too costly for the embedded market. It was later and slower than promised, and IBM used their own [[POWER3]] design instead, offering no 64-bit \"small\" version until the late-2002 introduction of the [[PowerPC 970]]. The 970 is a 64-bit processor derived from the [[POWER4]] server processor. To create it, the POWER4 core was modified to be backward-compatible with 32-bit PowerPC processors, and a vector unit (similar to the [[AltiVec]] extensions in Motorola's 74xx series) was added.\n\nIBM's [[IBM RS64|RS64]] processors are a family of chips implementing the \"Amazon\" variant of the PowerPC architecture. These processors are used in the [[RS/6000]] and [[IBM System i|AS/400]] computer families; the Amazon architecture includes proprietary extensions used by AS/400. The POWER4 and later POWER processors implement the Amazon architecture and replaced the RS64 chips in the RS/6000 and AS/400 families.\n\nIBM developed a separate product line called the \"4xx\" line focused on the embedded market. These designs included the 401, 403, 405, 440, and 460. In 2004, IBM sold their 4xx product line to Applied Micro Circuits Corporation (AMCC). AMCC continues to develop new high performance products, partly based on IBM's technology, along with technology that was developed within AMCC. These products focus on a variety of applications including networking, wireless, storage, printing/imaging and industrial automation.\n\nNumerically, the PowerPC is mostly found in controllers in cars. For the automotive market, Freescale Semiconductor initially offered many variations called the [[Mpc5xx|MPC5xx]] family such as the MPC555, built on a variation of the 601 core called the 8xx and designed in Israel by MSIL (Motorola Silicon Israel Limited). The 601 core is single issue, meaning it can only issue one instruction in a clock cycle. To this they add various bits of custom hardware, to allow for I/O on the one chip. In 2004, the next-generation four-digit [[PowerPC 5000#MPC55xx|55xx]] devices were launched for the automotive market. These use the newer [[PowerPC e200|e200]] series of PowerPC cores.\n\nNetworking is another area where embedded PowerPC processors are found in large numbers. MSIL took the [[QUICC]] engine from the [[Freescale 683XX|MC68302]] and made the [[PowerQUICC]] MPC860. This was a very famous processor used in many [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] edge routers in the late 1990s. Variants of the PowerQUICC include the MPC850, and the MPC823/MPC823e. All variants include a separate RISC microengine called the [[Communication Processor Module|CPM]] that offloads communications processing tasks from the central processor and has functions for [[Direct memory access|DMA]]. The follow-on chip from this family, the MPC8260, has a 603e-based core and a different CPM.\n\nHonda also uses PowerPC processors for [[ASIMO]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20001122S0048|title=Latest robots fill helper, entertainer roles|publisher=EETimes.com| accessdate=August 16, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, [[BAE Systems|BAE SYSTEMS Platform Solutions]] delivered the Vehicle-Management Computer for the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35]] fighter jet.
