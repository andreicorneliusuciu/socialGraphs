Some charge&nbsp;controllers&nbsp;/&nbsp;solar&nbsp;regulators have additional features, such as a [[low voltage disconnect]] (LVD), a separate circuit which powers down the load when the batteries become overly discharged (some battery chemistries are such that over-discharge can ruin the battery).<ref>\n[http://www.ferret.com.au/articles/z1/view.asp?id=62661 \"Conergy Solar-Port available from Energy Matters\"] (Press release). 2007-07-23.

[[Pulse width modulation]] (PWM) and [[maximum power point tracker]] (MPPT) technologies are more electronically sophisticated, adjusting charging rates depending on the battery's level, to allow charging closer to its maximum capacity.{{cn|date=July 2013}}\n\nA charge controller with MPPT capability frees the system designer from closely matching available PV voltage to battery voltage. Considerable efficiency gains can be achieved, particularly when the PV array is located at some distance from the battery. By way of example, a 150 volt PV array connected to an MPPT charge controller can be used to charge a 24 or 48 volt battery. Higher array voltage means lower array current, so the savings in wiring costs can more than pay for the controller.\n\nCharge controllers may also monitor battery temperature to prevent overheating. Some charge controller systems also display data, transmit data to remote displays, and data logging to track electric flow over time.\n\n== Integrated charge controller circuitry ==\n\nCircuitry that functions as a charge regulator controller may consist of several electrical components, or may be encapsulated in a single microchip, an [[integrated circuit]] (IC) usually called a charge controller IC or charge control IC.<ref name=\"analogic\" /><ref>[http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/1666 \"MAX712, MAX713 NiCd/NiMH Battery Fast-Charge Controllers.\"] (Data sheet).
