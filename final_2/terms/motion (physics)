Motion is typically described in terms of [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]], [[distance]], [[velocity]], [[acceleration]], [[time]] and [[speed]]. Motion of a body is observed by attaching a [[frame of reference]] to an observer and measuring the change in position of the body relative to that frame.\n\nIf the position of a body is not changing with respect to a given frame of reference, the body is said to be ''at rest'', ''motionless'', ''immobile'', ''[[wikt:stationary|stationary]]'', or to have constant ([[time-invariant]]) position. An object's motion cannot change unless it is acted upon by a [[force]], as described. Momentum is a quantity which is used for measuring motion of an object. An object's [[momentum]] is directly related to the object's [[mass]] and velocity, and the total momentum of all objects in an isolated system (one not affected by external forces) does not change with time, as described by the [[law of conservation of momentum]].\n\nAs there is no absolute frame of reference, ''absolute motion'' cannot be determined.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wahlin|first=Lars|chapter=9.1 Relative and absolute motion |title=The Deadbeat Universe|year=1997|publisher=Coultron Research|location=Boulder, CO|isbn=0-933407-03-3|pages=121\u2013129|url=http://www.colutron.com/download_files/chapt9.pdf |accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref> Thus, everything in the universe can be considered to be moving.<ref name=Tyson>{{cite book|last=Tyson|first=Neil de Grasse|author2=Charles Tsun-Chu Liu |author3=Robert Irion  |title=The universe : at home in the cosmos|year=2000|publisher=National Academy Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-309-06488-0}}</ref>{{rp|20\u201321}}\n\nMore generally, motion is a concept that applies to objects, bodies, and matter particles, to radiation, radiation fields and radiation particles, and to space, its curvature and space-time. One can also speak of motion of shapes and boundaries. So, the term motion in general signifies a continuous change in the configuration of a physical system. For example, one can talk about motion of a wave or about motion of a quantum particle, where the configuration consists of probabilities of occupying specific positions.\n\n[[Image:Leaving Yongsan Station.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Motion involves a change in position, such as in this perspective of rapidly leaving [[Yongsan Station]].]]\n\n==Laws of motion==\n{{Main|Mechanics}}\n\nIn physics, motion is described through two sets of apparently contradictory [[scientific law|laws]] of [[mechanics]]. Motions of all large scale and familiar objects in the universe (such as [[projectile]]s, [[planet]]s, [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, and [[human]]s) are described by [[classical mechanics]]. Whereas the motion of very small [[atom]]ic and [[subatomic particle|sub-atomic]] objects is described by [[quantum mechanic]]s.\n\n===Classical mechanics===\n{{Classical mechanics}}\nClassical mechanics is used for describing the motion of [[macroscopic]] objects, from [[projectiles]] to parts of [[machinery]], as well as [[astronomical objects]], such as [[spacecraft]], [[planets]], [[star]]s, and [[Galaxy|galaxies]]. It produces very accurate results within these domains, and is one of the oldest and largest in [[science]], [[engineering]], and [[technology]]. \n\nClassical mechanics is fundamentally based on [[Newton's laws of motion]]. These laws describe the relationship between the forces acting on a body and the motion of that body. They were first compiled by [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] in his work ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', first published on July 5, 1687. His three laws are:\n# A [[Physical body|body]] either is at rest or moves with constant velocity, until and unless an outer force is applied to it.\n# An object will travel in one direction only until an outer force changes its direction.\n# Whenever one body exerts a force '''F''' onto a second body,(in some cases, which is standing still) the second body exerts the force \u2212'''F''' on the first body. '''F''' and \u2212'''F''' are equal in magnitude and opposite in sense. So, the body which exerts '''F''' will go backwards.<ref>Newton's \"Axioms or Laws of Motion\" can be found in the \"[[Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy|Principia]]\" on [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA19#v=onepage&q=&f=false page 19 of volume 1 of the 1729 translation].</ref>\n\nNewton's three laws of motion, along with his Newton's law of motion, which were the first to accurately provide a mathematical model for understanding [[orbit]]ing bodies in [[outer space]]. This explanation unified the motion of celestial bodies and motion of objects on earth.\n\nClassical mechanics was later further enhanced by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. Motion of objects with a high [[velocity]], approaching the [[speed of light]]; general relativity is employed to handle [[gravitation]]al motion at a deeper level.\n\n===Quantum mechanics===\n{{main|Quantum mechanics}}\n[[Quantum mechanics]] is a set of principles describing [[Physical systems|physical reality]] at the atomic level of matter ([[molecule]]s and [[atom]]s) and the [[subatomic particle]]s ([[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, and even smaller particles). These descriptions include the simultaneous wave-like and particle-like behavior of both [[matter]] and [[radiation]] energy, this is described in the [[wave\u2013particle duality]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn classical mechanics, accurate [[measurement]]s and [[prediction]]s of the state of objects can be calculated, such as [[Absolute location|location]] and [[velocity]]. In the quantum mechanics, due to the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]), the complete state of a subatomic particle, such as its location and velocity, cannot be simultaneously determined. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nIn addition to describing the motion of atomic level phenomena, quantum mechanics is useful in understanding some large scale phenomenon such as [[superfluidity]], [[superconductivity]], and [[biological system]]s, including the function of [[smell receptors]] and the [[protein structure|structures of proteins]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n==List of \"imperceptible\" human motions==\nHumans, like all known things in the universe, are in constant motion,<ref name=Tyson/>{{rp|8\u20139}} however, aside from obvious movements of the various external [[anatomy|body]] parts and [[animal locomotion|locomotion]], humans are in motion in a variety of ways which are more difficult to [[Motion perception|perceive]].  Many of these \"imperceptible motions\" are only perceivable with the help of special tools and careful observation. The larger scales of \"imperceptible motions\" are difficult for humans to perceive for two reasons: 1) [[Newton's laws of motion]] (particularly [[Inertia]]) which prevent humans from feeling motions of a mass to which they are connected, and 2) the lack of an obvious [[frame of reference]] which would allow individuals to easily see that they are moving.<ref>{{cite web|last=Safkan|first=Yasar|title=Question: If the term 'absolute motion' has no meaning, then why do we say that the earth moves around the sun and not vice versa?|url=http://www.physlink.com/education/askexperts/ae118.cfm|work=Ask the Experts|publisher=PhysLink.com|accessdate=25 January 2014}}</ref> The smaller scales of these motions are too small for [[human]]s to [[sense]].\n\n===Universe===\n*[[Spacetime]] (the fabric of the universe) is actually [[Metric expansion of space|expanding]]. Essentially, everything in the [[universe]] is stretching like a [[rubber band]]. This motion is the most obscure as it is not physical motion as such, but rather a change in the very nature of the universe. The primary source of verification of this expansion was provided by [[Edwin Hubble]] who demonstrated that all galaxies and distant astronomical objects were moving away from us (''\"[[Hubble's law]]\"'') as predicted by a universal expansion.<ref>Hubble, Edwin, \"[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1929PNAS...15..168H&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=42ca922c9c30954 A Relation between Distance and Radial Velocity among Extra-Galactic Nebulae]\" (1929) ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'', Volume 15, Issue 3, pp. 168\u2013173 ([http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/15/3/168 Full article], PDF)</ref>\n\n===Galaxy===\n*The [[Milky Way Galaxy]], is moving through [[space]].
