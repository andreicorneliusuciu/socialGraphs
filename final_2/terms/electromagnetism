The electromagnetic force usually exhibits [[electromagnetic field]]s, such as [[electric field]]s, [[magnetic field]]s, and [[light]]. The electromagnetic force is one of the four [[fundamental interaction]]s (commonly called forces) in [[nature]]. The other three fundamental interactions are the [[strong interaction]], the [[weak interaction]], and [[gravitation]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ravaioli|first1=Fawwaz T.

Electromagnetic phenomena are defined in terms of the electromagnetic force, sometimes called the [[Lorentz force]], which includes both [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] as different manifestations of the same phenomenon.\n\nThe electromagnetic force plays a major role in determining the internal properties of most objects encountered in daily life. Ordinary matter takes its form as a result of [[intermolecular force]]s between individual atoms and [[molecule]]s in matter, and are a manifestation of the electromagnetic force. [[Electron]]s are bound by the electromagnetic force to [[atomic nuclei]], and their orbital shapes and their influence on nearby atoms with their electrons is described by quantum mechanics. The electromagnetic force governs the processes involved in [[chemistry]], which arise from interactions between the [[Molecular orbital|electrons]] of neighboring atoms.\n\nThere are numerous [[mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field]].  In [[classical electrodynamics]], electric fields are described as [[electric potential]] and [[electric current]]. In [[Faraday law of induction|Faraday's law]], [[magnetic field]]s are associated with [[electromagnetic induction]] and magnetism, and [[Maxwell's equations]] describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other and by charges and currents.\n\nThe theoretical implications of electromagnetism, in particular the establishment of the speed of light based on properties of the \"medium\" of propagation ([[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] and [[permittivity]]), led to the development of [[special relativity]] by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1905.\n\nAlthough electromagnetism is considered one of the four fundamental forces, at high energy the [[weak force]] and electromagnetic force are unified as a single [[electroweak interaction|electroweak force]]. In the history of the universe, during the [[quark epoch]] the unified force broke into the two separate forces as the universe cooled.\n\n==History of the theory==\n[[File:\u00d8rsted.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]].]]\n{{See also|History of electromagnetic theory}}\n\nOriginally, electricity and magnetism were thought of as two separate forces. This view changed, however, with the publication of [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s 1873 ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' in which the interactions of positive and negative charges were shown to be mediated by one force. There are four main effects resulting from these interactions, all of which have been clearly demonstrated by experiments:\n# Electric charges attract or repel one another with a force [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to the square of the distance between them: unlike charges attract, like ones repel.\n# Magnetic poles (or states of polarization at individual points) attract or repel one another in a manner similar to positive and negative charges and always exist as pairs: every north pole is yoked to a south pole.\n# An electric current inside a wire creates a corresponding circumferential magnetic field outside the wire.  Its direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) depends on the direction of the current in the wire.\n# A current is induced in a loop of wire when it is moved toward or away from a magnetic field, or a magnet is moved towards or away from it; the direction of current depends on that of the movement.\n\n[[File:Andre-marie-ampere2.jpg|thumb|140px|left|[[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]]]]\nWhile preparing for an evening lecture on 21 April 1820, [[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] made a surprising observation. As he was setting up his materials, he noticed a [[compass needle]] deflected away from [[magnetic north]] when the electric current from the battery he was using was switched on and off. This deflection convinced him that magnetic fields radiate from all sides of a wire carrying an electric current, just as light and heat do, and that it confirmed a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism.\n[[File:SS-faraday.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Michael Faraday]]]]\nAt the time of discovery, \u00d8rsted did not suggest any satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon, nor did he try to represent the phenomenon in a mathematical framework. However, three months later he began more intensive investigations. Soon thereafter he published his findings, proving that an electric current produces a magnetic field as it flows through a wire. The [[CGS]] unit of [[Electromagnetic induction|magnetic induction]] ([[oersted]]) is named in honor of his contributions to the field of electromagnetism.\n\n[[File:James-clerk-maxwell3.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[James Clerk Maxwell]]]]\nHis findings resulted in intensive research throughout the scientific community in [[electrodynamics]]. They influenced French physicist [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]]'s developments of a single mathematical form to represent the magnetic forces between current-carrying conductors. \u00d8rsted's discovery also represented a major step toward a unified concept of energy.\n\nThis unification, which was observed by [[Michael Faraday]], extended by [[James Clerk Maxwell]], and partially reformulated by [[Oliver Heaviside]] and [[Heinrich Hertz]], is one of the key accomplishments of 19th century [[mathematical physics]]. It had far-reaching consequences, one of which was the understanding of the nature of [[light]]. Unlike what was proposed by electromagnetic theory of that time, light and other [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] are at present seen as taking the form of [[quantum|quantized]], self-propagating [[oscillation|oscillatory]] electromagnetic field disturbances called [[photon]]s. Different [[frequency|frequencies]] of oscillation give rise to the different forms of [[electromagnetic radiation]], from [[radio wave]]s at the lowest frequencies, to visible light at intermediate frequencies, to [[gamma ray]]s at the highest frequencies.\n\n\u00d8rsted was not the only person to examine the relationship between electricity and magnetism. In 1802, [[Gian Domenico Romagnosi]], an Italian legal scholar, deflected a magnetic needle using electrostatic charges. Actually, no [[Galvanic cell|galvanic]] current existed in the setup and hence no electromagnetism was present. An account of the discovery was published in 1802 in an Italian newspaper, but it was largely overlooked by the contemporary scientific community.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Martins | first1 = Roberto de Andrade | title = Nuova Voltiana: Studies on Volta and his Times | chapter = Romagnosi and Volta's Pile: Early Difficulties in the Interpretation of Voltaic Electricity | volume = vol. 3 | editors = Fabio Bevilacqua and Lucio Fregonese (eds) | publisher = Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Pavia | pages = 81\u2013102 | url = http://ppp.unipv.it/collana/pages/libri/saggi/nuova%20voltiana3_pdf/cap4/4.pdf | accessdate = 2010-12-02}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Fundamental forces ==\n[[File:Circular.Polarization.Circularly.Polarized.Light Right.Handed.Animation.305x190.255Colors.gif|thumb|right|220px|Representation of the electric field vector of a wave of circularly polarized electromagnetic radiation.]]\nThe electromagnetic force is one of the four known [[fundamental force]]s. The other fundamental forces are:\n* the [[weak interaction|weak nuclear force]], which binds to all known particles in the [[Standard Model]], and causes certain forms of [[radioactive decay]]. (In [[particle physics]] though, the [[electroweak interaction]] is the unified description of two of the four known fundamental interactions of nature: electromagnetism and the weak interaction);\n* the [[strong interaction|strong nuclear force]], which binds [[quark]]s to form [[nucleon]]s, and binds nucleons to form [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]]\n* the [[gravity|gravitational force]].\nAll other forces (e.g., [[friction]], contact forces) are derived from these four fundamental forces (including momentum which is carried by the movement of particles).\n\nThe electromagnetic force is the one responsible for practically all the phenomena one encounters in daily life above the nuclear scale, with the exception of gravity. Roughly speaking, all the forces involved in interactions between [[atom]]s can be explained by the electromagnetic force acting between the electrically charged [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and [[electron]]s of the atoms. Electromagnetic forces also explain how these particles carry momentum by their movement. This includes the forces we experience in \"pushing\" or \"pulling\" ordinary material objects, which result from the [[intermolecular force]]s that act between the individual [[molecule]]s in our bodies and those in the objects. The electromagnetic force is also involved in all forms of [[chemistry|chemical phenomena]].\n\nA necessary part of understanding the intra-atomic and intermolecular forces is the effective force generated by the momentum of the electrons' movement, such that as electrons move between interacting atoms they carry momentum with them. As a collection of electrons becomes more confined, their minimum momentum necessarily increases due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. The behaviour of matter at the molecular scale including its density is determined by the balance between the electromagnetic force and the force generated by the exchange of momentum carried by the electrons themselves.\n\n==Classical electrodynamics==\n{{Main article|Classical electrodynamics}}\n\nIn 1600, [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] proposed, in his ''[[De Magnete]]'', that electricity and magnetism, while both capable of causing attraction and repulsion of objects, were distinct effects. Mariners had noticed that lightning strikes had the ability to disturb a compass needle, but the link between lightning and electricity was not confirmed until [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s proposed experiments in 1752.  One of the first to discover and publish a link between man-made electric current and magnetism was [[Romagnosi]], who in 1802 noticed that connecting a wire across a [[voltaic pile]] deflected a nearby [[compass]] needle. However, the effect did not become widely known until 1820, when \u00d8rsted performed a similar experiment.<ref name='Oersted'>{{cite web|url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/whmfield.html |title=Magnetic Fields -- History |accessdate=2009-11-27 |last=Stern |first=Dr. David P. |first2=Mauricio |last2=Peredo |date=2001-11-25 |publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center }}</ref> \u00d8rsted's work influenced Amp\u00e8re to produce a theory of electromagnetism that set the subject on a mathematical foundation.\n\nA theory of electromagnetism, known as [[classical electromagnetism]], was developed by various [[physicist]]s over the course of the 19th century, culminating in the work of [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who unified the preceding developments into a single theory and discovered the electromagnetic nature of light. In classical electromagnetism, the behavior of the electromagnetic field is described by a set of equations known as [[Maxwell's equations]], and the electromagnetic force is given by the [[Lorentz force|Lorentz force law]].\n\nOne of the peculiarities of classical electromagnetism is that it is difficult to reconcile with [[classical mechanics]], but it is compatible with special relativity. According to Maxwell's equations, the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum is a universal constant that is dependent only on the [[Permittivity|electrical permittivity]] and [[magnetic permeability]] of [[free space]]. This violates [[Galilean invariance]], a long-standing cornerstone of classical mechanics. One way to reconcile the two theories (electromagnetism and classical mechanics) is to assume the existence of a [[luminiferous aether]] through which the light propagates. However, subsequent experimental efforts failed to detect the presence of the aether. After important contributions of [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]], in 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] solved the problem with the introduction of special relativity, which replaced classical kinematics with a new theory of kinematics compatible with classical electromagnetism. (For more information, see [[History of special relativity]].)\n\nIn addition, relativity theory implies that in moving frames of reference a magnetic field transforms to a field with a nonzero electric component and conversely, a moving electric field transforms to a nonzero magnetic component, thus firmly showing that the phenomena are two sides of the same coin. Hence the term \"electromagnetism\". (For more information, see [[Classical electromagnetism and special relativity]] and [[Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism]].\n\n==Quantum mechanics==\n{{Quantum field theory}}\n\n===Early quantum theory===\n{{Main article|Photoelectric effect}}\nIn a second paper published in 1905, Albert Einstein undermined the very foundations of classical electromagnetism. In his theory of the [[photoelectric effect]], for which he won the Nobel prize in physics, he posited that light could exist in discrete particle-like quantities, which later came to be called [[photon]]s. Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect extended the insights that appeared in the solution of the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]] presented by [[Max Planck]] in 1900 and who coined the term \"quanta\" . In his work, Planck showed that hot objects emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete packets (\"quanta\"), which leads to a finite total [[energy]] emitted as [[black body radiation]]. Both of these results were in direct contradiction with the classical view of light as a continuous wave. Planck's and Einstein's theories were progenitors of [[quantum mechanics]], which, when formulated in 1925, necessitated the invention of a quantum theory of electromagnetism.\n\n===Quantum electrodynamics===\n{{main article|Quantum electrodynamics}}\nMaxwell's equations have been superseded by quantum electrodynamics (QED).

Like classical electromagnetism, QED is a linear U(1) gauge group.\n\n===Electroweak interaction===\n{{main article|Electroweak interaction}}\nThe '''electroweak interaction''' is a [[unified field theory]] description of two of the four known  [[fundamental interaction]]s of nature: electromagnetism and the [[weak interaction]]. It is a  SU(2) \u00d7 U(1) gauge group. Although these two forces appear very different at everyday low energies, the theory models them as two different aspects of the same force. At energies greater than 100&nbsp;[[GeV]], called the [[electroweak scale|unification energy]], the two forces merge into a single '''electroweak force'''. Thus when the universe was hot enough (approximately 10<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]], a temperature that was exceeded until shortly after the [[Big Bang]]) the electromagnetic force and weak force were merged into the electroweak force. With the cooling of the universe, at the end of the [[electroweak epoch]], the electroweak force separated into the electromagnetic force and the [[weak force]]. During the following [[quark epoch]], it was still too hot for quarks to combine into [[hadrons]] and they moved about freely.\n\n==Chaotic and emergent phenomena==\n{{Beyond the Standard Model}}\n{{see also|Chaos Theory|Emergence|Self-organization}}\nThe mathematical models used in [[classical electromagnetism]], [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) and the [[standard model]] all view the electromagnetic force as a linear set of equations. In these theories electromagnetism is a U(1) gauge theory, whose topological properties do not allow any complex nonlinear interaction of a field with and on itself.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barrett|first1=Terence W.|title=Topological Foundations of Electromagnetism|date=2008|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore|isbn=978-981-277-997-7|page=2|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=e0-QdLqT-pIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Terence+W.+Barrett%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAs5vgyorQAhWWOsAKHTT7DDAQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> For example, in the [[QED vacuum]] the field fluctuates randomly as a consequence of the [[uncertainty principle]] but that these fluctuations cancel each over out with no overall observable effect.
