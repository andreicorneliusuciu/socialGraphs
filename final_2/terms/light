[[Sunlight]] provides the energy that green [[plants]] use to create sugars mostly in the form of starches, which release energy into the living things that digest them. This process of [[photosynthesis]] provides virtually all the energy used by living things. Historically, another important source of light for humans has been fire, from ancient campfires to modern kerosene lamps. With the development of [[electric light]]s and [[history of electric power transmission|power systems]], electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight. Some species of animals generate their own light, a process called [[bioluminescence]]. For example, fireflies use light to locate mates, and vampire squids use it to hide themselves from prey.\n\nThe primary properties of visible light are [[intensity (physics)|intensity]], propagation direction, frequency or wavelength [[spectrum]], and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]], while its [[speed of light|speed]] in a vacuum, 299,792,458 metres per second, is one of the fundamental [[Mathematical constant|constants]] of nature. Visible light, as with all types of electromagnetic radiation (EMR), is experimentally found to always move at this speed in a vacuum.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nIn [[physics]], the term ''light'' sometimes refers to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Camera lenses: from box camera to digital | author = Gregory Hallock Smith | publisher = SPIE Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-8194-6093-6 | page = 4 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=6mb0C0cFCEYC&pg=PA4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | title = Comprehensive Physics XII | author = Narinder Kumar | publisher = Laxmi Publications | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-81-7008-592-8 | page = 1416 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=IryMtwHHngIC&pg=PA1416}}</ref> In this sense, [[gamma ray]]s, [[X-ray]]s, [[microwave]]s and [[radio wave]]s are also light. Like all types of light, visible light is emitted and absorbed in tiny \"packets\" called [[photon]]s and exhibits properties of both [[wave]]s and [[Particle physics|particles]]. This property is referred to as the [[wave\u2013particle duality]]. The study of light, known as [[optics]], is an important research area in modern physics.\n\n==Electromagnetic spectrum and visible light==\n{{Main article|Electromagnetic spectrum}}\n[[File:EM spectrum.svg|thumb|380px|right|[[Electromagnetic spectrum]] with light highlighted]]\nGenerally, EM radiation, or EMR (the designation \"radiation\" excludes static electric and magnetic and [[near and far field|near fields]]), is classified by wavelength into [[radio]], [[microwave]], [[infrared]], the '''visible region''' that we perceive as light, [[ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma rays]].\n\nThe behavior of EMR depends on its wavelength.  Higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths.  When EMR interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior depends on the amount of energy per quantum it carries.\n\nEMR in the visible light region consists of quanta (called [[photon]]s) that are at the lower end of the energies that are capable of causing electronic excitation within molecules, which leads to changes in the bonding or chemistry of the molecule. At the lower end of the visible light spectrum, EMR becomes invisible to humans (infrared) because its photons no longer have enough individual energy to cause a lasting molecular change (a change in conformation) in the visual molecule [[retinal]] in the human retina, which change triggers the sensation of vision.\n\nThere exist animals that are sensitive to various types of infrared, but not by means of quantum-absorption. [[Infrared sensing in snakes]] depends on a kind of natural [[thermal imaging]], in which tiny packets of cellular water are raised in temperature by the infrared radiation. EMR in this range causes molecular vibration and heating effects, which is how these animals detect it.\n\nAbove the range of visible light, ultraviolet light becomes invisible to humans, mostly because it is absorbed by the cornea below 360 nanometers and the internal lens below 400. Furthermore, the [[rod cell|rods]] and [[cone cell|cones]] located in the [[retina]] of the human eye cannot detect the very short (below 360&nbsp;nm) ultraviolet wavelengths and are in fact damaged by ultraviolet.  Many animals with eyes that do not require lenses (such as insects and shrimp) are able to detect ultraviolet, by quantum photon-absorption mechanisms, in much the same chemical way that humans detect visible light.\n\nVarious sources define visible light as narrowly as 420 to 680<ref>{{cite book|last=Laufer|first=Gabriel|title=Introduction to Optics and Lasers in Engineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MxLPYMS5TUC&pg=PA11|accessdate=20 October 2013|date=13 July 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-45233-5|page=11}}</ref><ref name=\"Bradt2004\">{{cite book|last=Bradt|first=Hale|title=Astronomy Methods: A Physical Approach to Astronomical Observations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hp7vyaGvhLMC&pg=PA26|accessdate=20 October 2013|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-53551-9|page=26}}</ref> to as broadly as 380 to 800&nbsp;nm.<ref name=\"OhannesianStreeter2001\">{{cite book|last1=Ohannesian|first1=Lena|last2=Streeter|first2=Anthony|title=Handbook of Pharmaceutical Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwPb4wgqseYC&pg=PA187|accessdate=20 October 2013|date=9 November 2001|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8247-4194-5|page=187}}</ref><ref name=\"AhluwaliaGoyal2000\">{{cite book|last1=Ahluwalia|first1=V.

The fixed value of the speed of light in SI units results from the fact that the metre is now defined in terms of the speed of light. All forms of electromagnetic radiation move at exactly this same speed in vacuum.\n\nDifferent [[physicist]]s have attempted to measure the speed of light throughout history. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] attempted to measure the speed of light in the seventeenth century. An early experiment to measure the speed of light was conducted by [[Ole R\u00f8mer]], a Danish physicist, in 1676. Using a [[telescope]], R\u00f8mer observed the motions of [[Jupiter]] and one of its [[natural satellite|moons]], [[Io (moon)|Io]]. Noting discrepancies in the apparent period of Io's orbit, he calculated that light takes about 22 minutes to traverse the diameter of [[Earth]]'s orbit.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&id=pdf_1&handle=euclid.ss/1009212817|title=Scientific Method, Statistical Method and the Speed of Light|journal=Statistical Science|year=2000|volume=15|pages=254\u2013278|issue=3|doi=10.1214/ss/1009212817|MR=1847825}}</ref> However, its size was not known at that time. If R\u00f8mer had known the diameter of the Earth's orbit, he would have calculated a speed of 227,000,000&nbsp;m/s.\n\nAnother, more accurate, measurement of the speed of light was performed in Europe by [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] in 1849. Fizeau directed a beam of light at a mirror several kilometers away. A rotating [[cog wheel]] was placed in the path of the light beam as it traveled from the source, to the mirror and then returned to its origin.  Fizeau found that at a certain rate of rotation, the beam would pass through one gap in the wheel on the way out and the next gap on the way back. Knowing the distance to the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, Fizeau was able to calculate the speed of light as 313,000,000&nbsp;m/s.\n\n[[L\u00e9on Foucault]] used an experiment which used rotating mirrors to obtain a value of 298,000,000&nbsp;m/s in 1862. [[Albert A. Michelson]] conducted experiments on the speed of light from 1877 until his death in 1931. He refined Foucault's methods in 1926 using improved rotating mirrors to measure the time it took light to make a round trip from [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]] to [[Mount San Antonio]] in [[California]]. The precise measurements yielded a speed of 299,796,000&nbsp;m/s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Michelson,|first=A.

For example, the speed of light in water is about 3/4 of that in vacuum.\n\nTwo independent teams of physicists were said to bring light to a \"complete standstill\" by passing it through a [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]] of the element [[rubidium]], one team at [[Harvard University]] and the [[Rowland Institute for Science]] in Cambridge, Mass., and the other at the [[Harvard\u2013Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]], also in Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web|author=Harvard News Office |url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/01.24/01-stoplight.html |title=Harvard Gazette: Researchers now able to stop, restart light |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date=2001-01-24 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}</ref> However, the popular description of light being \"stopped\" in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrary later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had \"stopped\" it had ceased to be light.\n\n==Optics==\n{{Main article|Optics}}\n\nThe study of light and the interaction of light and [[matter]] is termed [[optics]]. The observation and study of [[optical phenomenon|optical phenomena]] such as [[rainbow]]s and the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora borealis]] offer many clues as to the nature of light.\n\n===Refraction===\n{{Main article|Refraction}}\n[[File:Refraction-with-soda-straw.jpg|thumb|250 px|An example of refraction of light. The straw appears bent, because of refraction of light as it enters liquid from air.]]\n[[File:Cloud in the sunlight.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[cloud]] illuminated by [[sunlight]]]]\n\nRefraction is the bending of light rays when passing through a surface between one transparent material and another. It is described by [[Snell's Law]]:\n\n:<math>n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2\\ .</math>\n\nwhere &theta;<sub>1</sub> is the angle between the ray and the [[Normal (geometry)|surface normal]] in the first medium, &theta;<sub>2</sub> is the angle between the ray and the surface normal in the second medium, and n<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub> are the [[index of refraction|indices of refraction]], ''n'' = 1 in a [[vacuum]] and ''n'' > 1 in a [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] [[Chemical substance|substance]].\n\nWhen a beam of light crosses the boundary between a vacuum and another medium, or between two different media, the wavelength of the light changes, but the frequency remains constant. If the beam of light is not [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] (or rather normal) to the boundary, the change in wavelength results in a change in the direction of the beam. This change of direction is known as [[refraction]].\n\nThe refractive quality of [[lens (optics)|lenses]] is frequently used to manipulate light in order to change the apparent size of images. [[Magnifying glass]]es, [[Glasses|spectacles]], [[contact lens]]es, [[microscope]]s and [[refracting telescope]]s are all examples of this manipulation.\n\n==Light sources== <!-- This section is linked from [[Source]] -->\n{{Further information|List of light sources}}\n\nThere are many sources of light. The most common light sources are thermal: a body at a given [[temperature]] emits a characteristic spectrum of [[black-body]] radiation. A simple thermal source is [[sunlight]], the radiation emitted by the [[chromosphere]] of the [[Sun]] at around  {{convert|6,000|K|C F|abbr=off}} peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when plotted in wavelength units<ref>http://thulescientific.com/LYNCH%20&%20Soffer%20OPN%201999.pdf</ref> and roughly 44% of sunlight energy that reaches the ground is visible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/ |title=Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance:  Air Mass 1.5|accessdate=2009-11-12}}</ref> Another example is [[incandescent light bulb]]s, which emit only around 10% of their energy as visible light and the remainder as infrared. A common thermal light source in history is the glowing solid particles in [[fire|flames]], but these also emit most of their radiation in the infrared, and only a fraction in the visible spectrum. The peak of the blackbody spectrum is in the deep infrared, at about 10 [[micrometre]] wavelength, for relatively cool objects like human beings. As the temperature increases, the peak shifts to shorter wavelengths, producing first a red glow, then a white one, and finally a blue-white colour as the peak moves out of the visible part of the spectrum and into the ultraviolet. These colours can be seen when metal is [[heat]]ed to \"red hot\" or \"white hot\". Blue-white [[thermal emission]] is not often seen, except in stars (the commonly seen pure-blue colour in a [[natural gas|gas]] flame or a [[Welding|welder's]] torch is in fact due to molecular emission, notably by CH radicals (emitting a wavelength band around 425&nbsp;nm, and is not seen in stars or pure thermal radiation).\n\nAtoms emit and absorb light at characteristic energies. This produces \"[[emission line]]s\" in the spectrum of each atom. [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|Emission]] can be [[spontaneous emission|spontaneous]], as in [[light-emitting diode]]s, [[gas discharge]] lamps (such as [[neon lamp]]s and [[neon sign]]s, [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s, etc.), and flames (light from the hot gas itself\u2014so, for example, [[sodium]] in a gas flame emits characteristic yellow light). Emission can also be [[stimulated emission|stimulated]], as in a [[laser]] or a microwave [[maser]].\n\nDeceleration of a free charged particle, such as an [[electron]], can produce visible radiation: [[cyclotron radiation]], [[synchrotron radiation]], and [[bremsstrahlung]] radiation are all examples of this. Particles moving through a medium faster than the speed of light in that medium can produce visible [[Cherenkov radiation]].\n\nCertain chemicals produce visible radiation by [[chemoluminescence]]. In living things, this process is called [[bioluminescence]]. For example, [[firefly|fireflies]] produce light by this means, and boats moving through water can disturb plankton which produce a glowing wake.\n\nCertain substances produce light when they are illuminated by more energetic radiation, a process known as [[fluorescence]]. Some substances emit light slowly after excitation by more energetic radiation. This is known as [[phosphorescence]].\n\nPhosphorescent materials can also be excited by bombarding them with subatomic particles. [[Cathodoluminescence]] is one example. This mechanism is used in [[cathode ray tube]] [[television set]]s and [[computer monitor]]s.\n\n[[File:A city illuminated by colorful artificial lighting at night.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[city]] illuminated by colorful [[lighting|artificial lighting]]]]\n\nCertain other mechanisms can produce light:\n* [[Bioluminescence]]\n* [[Cherenkov radiation]]\n* [[Electroluminescence]]\n* [[Scintillation (physics)|Scintillation]]\n* [[Sonoluminescence]]\n* [[Triboluminescence]]\n\nWhen the concept of light is intended to include very-high-energy photons (gamma rays), additional generation mechanisms include:\n* Particle\u2013[[antiparticle]] annihilation\n* [[Radioactive decay]]\n\n==Units and measures==\n{{Main article|Photometry (optics)|Radiometry}}\n\nLight is measured with two main alternative sets of units: [[radiometry]] consists of measurements of light power at all wavelengths, while [[photometry (optics)|photometry]] measures light with wavelength weighted with respect to a standardised model of human brightness perception.  Photometry is useful, for example, to quantify [[Illumination (lighting)]] intended for human use.  The SI units for both systems are summarised in the following tables.\n\n{{SI radiometry units|1|self|nb}}<!-- parameter 1 for table number, parameter 2 for compare destination page, parameter 3 for reference group -->\n{{SI light units|2|self|nb}}<!-- parameter 1 for table number, parameter 2 for compare destination page, parameter 3 for reference group -->\n\nThe photometry units are different from most systems of physical units in that they take into account how the human eye responds to light. The [[cone cell]]s in the human eye are of three types which respond differently across the visible spectrum, and the cumulative response peaks at a wavelength of around 555&nbsp;nm. Therefore, two sources of light which produce the same intensity (W/m<sup>2</sup>) of visible light do not necessarily appear equally bright. The photometry units are designed to take this into account, and therefore are a better representation of how \"bright\" a light appears to be than raw intensity. They relate to raw [[power (physics)|power]] by a quantity called [[luminous efficacy]], and are used for purposes like determining how to best achieve sufficient illumination for various tasks in indoor and outdoor settings. The illumination measured by a [[photocell]] sensor does not necessarily correspond to what is perceived by the human eye, and without filters which may be costly, photocells and [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCD) tend to respond to some [[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]] or both.\n\n==Light pressure==\n{{Main article|Radiation pressure}}\nLight exerts physical pressure on objects in its path, a phenomenon which can be deduced by Maxwell's equations, but can be more easily explained by the particle nature of light: photons strike and transfer their momentum. Light pressure is equal to the power of the light beam divided by ''[[speed of light|c]]'', the speed of light.{{nbsp}} Due to the magnitude of ''c'', the effect of light pressure is negligible for everyday objects.{{nbsp}} For example, a one-[[watt|milliwatt]] [[laser pointer]] exerts a force of about 3.3 [[newton (unit)|piconewtons]] on the object being illuminated; thus, one could lift a [[penny (United States coin)|U.S. penny]] with laser pointers, but doing so would require about 30 billion 1-mW laser pointers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tang|first=Hong|title=May The Force of Light Be With You|journal=IEEE Spectrum|date=1 October 2009|volume=46|issue=10|pages=46\u201351|doi=10.1109/MSPEC.2009.5268000}}</ref>{{nbsp}} However, in [[nanometre]]-scale applications such as [[nanoelectromechanical systems]] (|NEMS), the effect of light pressure is more significant, and exploiting light pressure to drive NEMS mechanisms and to flip nanometre-scale physical switches in integrated circuits is an active area of research.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.eng.yale.edu/tanglab/research.htm nano-opto-mechanical systems research at Yale University].</ref>\n\nAt larger scales, light pressure can cause [[asteroid]]s to spin faster,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://discovermagazine.com/2004/feb/asteroids-get-spun-by-the-sun/ | title = Asteroids Get Spun By the Sun\n| author = Kathy A. | work = Discover Magazine | date = 2004-02-05}}</ref> acting on their irregular shapes as on the vanes of a [[windmill]].{{nbsp}} The possibility of making [[solar sail]]s that would accelerate spaceships in space is also under investigation.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/roboticexplorers/solar_sails.html | title = Solar Sails Could Send Spacecraft 'Sailing' Through Space | work = [[NASA]] | date = 2004-08-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/news/releases/2004/04-208.html | title = NASA team successfully deploys two solar sail systems | work = NASA | date = 2004-08-09}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the motion of the [[Crookes radiometer]] was originally attributed to light pressure, this interpretation is incorrect; the characteristic Crookes rotation is the result of a partial vacuum.<ref>P.

He wrote, \u201cradiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The backwardacting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant 'radiation friction' in brief.\u201d\n\n==Historical theories about light, in chronological order==\n\n===Classical Greece and Hellenism===\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2011}}\nIn the fifth century BC, [[Empedocles]] postulated that everything was composed of [[Classical element|four elements]]; fire, air, earth and water. He believed that [[Aphrodite]] made the human eye out of the four elements and that she lit the fire in the eye which shone out from the eye making sight possible. If this were true, then one could see during the night just as well as during the day, so Empedocles postulated an interaction between rays from the eyes and rays from a source such as the sun.\n\nIn about 300 BC, [[Euclid]] wrote ''Optica'', in which he studied the properties of light. Euclid postulated that light travelled in straight lines and he described the laws of reflection and studied them mathematically. He questioned that sight is the result of a beam from the eye, for he asks how one sees the stars immediately, if one closes one's eyes, then opens them at night. Of course if the beam from the eye travels infinitely fast this is not a problem.\n\nIn 55 BC, [[Lucretius]], a Roman who carried on the ideas of earlier Greek [[atomism|atomists]], wrote:\n\n\"''The light & heat of the sun; these are composed of minute atoms which, when they are shoved off, lose no time in shooting right across the interspace of air in the direction imparted by the shove.''\" \u2013 ''On the nature of the Universe''\n\nDespite being similar to later particle theories, Lucretius's views were not generally accepted.\n\n[[Ptolemy]] (c. 2nd century) wrote about the [[refraction]] of light in his book ''Optics''.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Ptolemy's Theory of Visual Perception: An English Translation of the Optics with Introduction and Commentary | author = Ptolemy and A.

According to the Samkhya school, light is one of the five fundamental \"subtle\" elements (''tanmatra'') out of which emerge the gross elements. The [[atomism|atomicity]] of these elements is not specifically mentioned and it appears that they were actually taken to be continuous.<ref name=\"sifuae.com\">http://www.sifuae.com/sif/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Shastra-Pratibha-2015-Seniors-Booklet.pdf</ref>\nOn the other hand, the Vaisheshika school gives an [[atomic theory]] of the physical world on the non-atomic ground of [[Aether (classical element)|ether]], space and time. (See ''[[Atomism#Indian atomism|Indian atomism]]''.) The basic atoms are those of earth (''prthivi''), water (''pani''), fire (''agni''), and air (''vayu'') Light rays are taken to be a stream of high velocity of ''tejas'' (fire) atoms. The particles of light can exhibit different characteristics depending on the speed and the arrangements of the ''tejas'' atoms.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\nThe ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' refers to [[sunlight]] as \"the seven rays of the sun\".{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}<ref name=\"sifuae.com\"/>\n\nThe Indian [[Buddhist]]s, such as [[Dign\u0101ga]] in the 5th century and [[Dharmakirti]] in the 7th century, developed a type of atomism that is a philosophy about reality being composed of atomic entities that are momentary flashes of light or energy. They viewed light as being an atomic entity equivalent to energy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}<ref name=\"sifuae.com\"/>\n\n===Descartes===\n[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] (1596\u20131650) held that light was a [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical]] property of the luminous body, rejecting the \"forms\" of [[Alhazen|Ibn al-Haytham]] and [[Witelo]] as well as the \"species\" of [[Roger Bacon#Legacy|Bacon]], [[Grosseteste]], and [[Kepler]].<ref name=\"Theoriesof\">''Theories of light, from Descartes to Newton'' A. I. Sabra CUP Archive,1981 pg 48 ISBN 0-521-28436-8, ISBN 978-0-521-28436-3</ref>  In 1637 he published a theory of the [[refraction]] of light that assumed, incorrectly, that light travelled faster in a denser medium than in a less dense medium. Descartes arrived at this conclusion by analogy with the behaviour of [[sound]] waves.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Although Descartes was incorrect about the relative speeds, he was correct in assuming that light behaved like a wave and in concluding that refraction could be explained by the speed of light in different media.\n\nDescartes is not the first to use the mechanical analogies but because he clearly asserts that light is only a mechanical property of the luminous body and the transmitting medium, Descartes' theory of light is regarded as the start of modern physical optics.<ref name=\"Theoriesof\" />\n\n===Particle theory===\n{{Main article|Corpuscular theory of light}}\n[[File:PierreGassendi.jpg|thumb|200 px|[[Pierre Gassendi]].]]\n[[Pierre Gassendi]] (1592\u20131655), an atomist, proposed a particle theory of light which was published posthumously in the 1660s.  [[Isaac Newton]] studied Gassendi's work at an early age, and preferred his view to Descartes' theory of the ''plenum''. He stated in his ''Hypothesis of Light'' of 1675 that light was composed of [[Corpuscularianism|corpuscles]] (particles of matter) which were emitted in all directions from a source. One of Newton's arguments against the wave nature of light was that waves were known to bend around obstacles, while light travelled only in straight lines. He did, however, explain the phenomenon of the [[diffraction]] of light (which had been observed by [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|Francesco Grimaldi]]) by allowing that a light particle could create a localised wave in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]].\n\nNewton's theory could be used to predict the [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] of light, but could only explain [[refraction]] by incorrectly assuming that light accelerated upon entering a denser [[Medium (optics)|medium]] because the [[gravity|gravitational]] pull was greater. Newton published the final version of his theory in his ''[[Opticks]]'' of 1704. His reputation helped the [[particle theory of light]] to hold sway during the 18th century. The particle theory of light led [[Laplace]] to argue that a body could be so massive that light could not escape from it. In other words, it would become what is now called a [[black hole]]. Laplace withdrew his suggestion later, after a wave theory of light became firmly established as the model for light (as has been explained, neither a particle or wave theory is fully correct). A translation of Newton's essay on light appears in ''The large scale structure of space-time,'' by [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[George F. R. Ellis]].\n\nThe fact that light could be [[polarized light|polarized]] was for the first time qualitatively explained by Newton using the particle theory. [[\u00c9tienne-Louis Malus]] in 1810 created a mathematical particle theory of polarization. [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] in 1812 showed that this theory explained all known phenomena of light polarization. At that time the polarization was considered as the proof of the particle theory.\n\n=== Wave theory ===\nTo explain the origin of colors, [[Robert Hooke]] (1635-1703) developed a \"pulse theory\" and compared the spreading of light to that of waves in water in his 1665 work ''[[Micrographia]]'' (\"Observation IX\"). In 1672 Hooke suggested that light's vibrations could be [[perpendicular]] to the direction of propagation. [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629-1695) worked out a mathematical wave theory of light in 1678, and published it in his ''[[Treatise on light]]'' in 1690. He proposed that light was emitted in all directions as a series of waves in a medium called the ''[[Luminiferous ether]]''.  As waves are not affected by gravity, it was assumed that they slowed down upon entering a denser medium.<ref>Fokko Jan Dijksterhuis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cPFevyomPUIC Lenses and Waves: Christiaan Huygens and the Mathematical Science of Optics in the 17th Century], Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2004, ISBN 1-4020-2697-8</ref>\n\n[[File:Christiaan Huygens, by Caspar Netscher.jpg|thumb|200 px|[[Christiaan Huygens]].]]\n\n[[File:Young Diffraction.png|right|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]'s sketch of a [[double-slit experiment]] showing [[diffraction]]. Young's experiments supported the theory that light consists of waves.]]\n\nThe wave theory predicted that light waves could interfere with each other like [[sound]] waves (as noted around 1800 by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]). Young showed by means of a [[double-slit experiment|diffraction experiment]] that light behaved as waves. He also proposed that different [[color|colours]] were caused by different [[wavelength]]s of light, and explained colour vision in terms of three-coloured receptors in the eye.\n\nAnother supporter of the wave theory was [[Leonhard Euler]]. He argued in ''Nova theoria lucis et colorum'' (1746) that [[diffraction]] could more easily be explained by a wave theory.\n\nIn 1816 [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]] gave [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] an idea that the polarization of light can be explained by the wave theory if light were a [[transverse wave]].<ref>James R. Hofmann, ''Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re: Enlightenment and Electrodynamics'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 222.</ref>\n\nLater, Fresnel independently worked out his own wave theory of light, and presented it to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences]] in 1817. [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]] added to Fresnel's mathematical work to produce a convincing argument in favour of the wave theory, helping to overturn Newton's corpuscular theory. By the year 1821, Fresnel was able to show via mathematical methods that polarisation could be explained by the wave theory of light and only if light was entirely transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever.\n\nThe weakness of the wave theory was that light waves, like sound waves, would need a medium for transmission. The existence of the hypothetical substance ''luminiferous aether'' proposed by Huygens in 1678 was cast into strong doubt in the late nineteenth century by the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]].\n\nNewton's corpuscular theory implied that light would travel faster in a denser medium, while the wave theory of Huygens and others implied the opposite. At that time, the [[speed of light]] could not be measured accurately enough to decide which theory was correct. The first to make a sufficiently accurate measurement was [[L\u00e9on Foucault]], in 1850.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Understanding Physics |author1=David Cassidy |author2=Gerald Holton |author3=James Rutherford | publisher = Birkh\u00e4user | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-387-98756-8 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=rpQo7f9F1xUC&pg=PA382}}</ref> His result supported the wave theory, and the classical particle theory was finally abandoned, only to partly re-emerge in the 20th century.\n\n===Electromagnetic theory as explanation for all types of visible light and all EM radiation===\n{{Main article|Electromagnetic radiation}}\n[[File:light-wave.svg|360px|thumb|A 3\u2013dimensional rendering of [[Polarization (waves)|linearly polarised]] light wave frozen in time and showing the two oscillating components of light; an [[electric field]] and a [[magnetic field]] perpendicular to each other and to the direction of motion (a [[transverse wave]]).]]\n\nIn 1845, [[Michael Faraday]] discovered that the plane of polarisation of linearly polarised light is rotated when the light rays travel along the [[magnetic field]] direction in the presence of a transparent [[dielectric]], an effect now known as [[Faraday rotation]].<ref name=\"LongairMalcolm\">{{cite book|last=Longair|first=Malcolm|title=Theoretical Concepts in Physics|year=2003|page=87}}</ref>  This was the first evidence that light was related to [[electromagnetism]]. In 1846 he speculated that light might be some form of disturbance propagating along magnetic field lines.<ref name=\"LongairMalcolm\" /> Faraday proposed in 1847 that light was a high-frequency electromagnetic vibration, which could propagate even in the absence of a medium such as the ether.\n\nFaraday's work inspired [[James Clerk Maxwell]] to study electromagnetic radiation and light. Maxwell discovered that self-propagating electromagnetic waves would travel through space at a constant speed, which happened to be equal to the previously measured speed of light. From this, Maxwell concluded that light was a form of electromagnetic radiation: he first stated this result in 1862 in ''On Physical Lines of Force''. In 1873, he published ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'', which contained a full mathematical description of the behaviour of electric and magnetic fields, still known as [[Maxwell's equations]]. Soon after, [[Heinrich Hertz]] confirmed Maxwell's theory experimentally by generating and detecting [[radio]] waves in the laboratory, and demonstrating that these waves behaved exactly like visible light, exhibiting properties such as reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference. Maxwell's theory and Hertz's experiments led directly to the development of modern radio, radar, television, electromagnetic imaging, and wireless communications.\n\nIn the quantum theory, photons are seen as [[wave packet]]s of the waves described in the classical theory of Maxwell. The quantum theory was needed to explain effects even with visual light that Maxwell's classical theory could not (such as [[spectral line]]s).\n\n===Quantum theory===\nIn 1900 [[Max Planck]], attempting to explain [[black body radiation]] suggested that although light was a wave, these waves could gain or lose energy only in finite amounts related to their frequency. Planck called these \"lumps\" of light energy \"quanta\" (from a Latin word for \"how much\"). In 1905, Albert Einstein used the idea of light quanta to explain the [[photoelectric effect]], and suggested that these light quanta had a \"real\" existence. In 1923 [[Arthur Holly Compton]] showed that the wavelength shift seen when low intensity X-rays scattered from electrons (so called [[Compton scattering]]) could be explained by a particle-theory of X-rays, but not a wave theory. In 1926 [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] named these light quanta particles [[photon]]s.\n\nEventually the modern theory of [[quantum mechanics]] came to picture light as (in some sense) ''both'' a particle and a wave, and (in another sense), as a phenomenon which is ''neither'' a particle nor a wave (which actually are macroscopic phenomena, such as baseballs or ocean waves). Instead, modern physics sees light as something that can be described sometimes with mathematics appropriate to one type of macroscopic metaphor (particles), and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor (water waves), but is actually something that cannot be fully imagined. As in the case for radio waves and the X-rays involved in Compton scattering, physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies, but more like a classical particle at higher frequencies, but never completely loses all qualities of one or the other. Visible light, which occupies a middle ground in frequency, can easily be shown in experiments to be describable using either a wave or particle model, or sometimes both.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Physics|Science}}\n{{cmn|3|\n* [[Automotive lighting]]\n* [[Ballistic photon]]\n* [[Color temperature]]\n* [[Fermat's principle]]\n* [[Huygens' principle]]\n*[[Incandescent light bulb]]\n* [[International Commission on Illumination]]\n* ''[[Journal of Luminescence]]''\n* [[Light art]]\n* [[Light beam]] \u2013 in particular about light beams visible from the side\n* [[Light Fantastic (TV series)]]\n* [[Light mill]]\n* [[Light Painting]]\n* [[Light pollution]]\n* [[Light therapy]]\n* [[Lighting]]\n* [[List of light sources]]\n* ''[[Luminescence: The Journal of Biological and Chemical Luminescence]]''\n* [[Photic sneeze reflex]]\n* [[Photometry (optics)|Photometry]]\n* [[Photon]]\n* [[Rights of Light]]\n* [[Risks and benefits of sun exposure]]\n* [[Spectroscopy]]\n* [[Visible spectrum]]\n* [[Wave\u2013particle duality]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons-inline|Light}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n* {{Wikiquote-inline}}\n\n{{Color topics}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Light| ]]"}]}}}}
