The relative sizes and type of orbit are similar to the [[Pluto]]\u2013[[Charon (moon)|Charon]] system.]]\nIn [[physics]], an '''orbit''' is the [[gravitationally]] curved path of an object about a point in space, for example the orbit of a [[planet]] about a star<ref>[http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/barycenter/ The Space Place :: What's a Barycenter]</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/431123/orbit orbit (astronomy) \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia]</ref> or a [[natural satellite]] around a planet. Orbits of planets are typically [[elliptical]], and the central mass being orbited is at a focal point of the ellipse.\n\nCurrent understanding of the mechanics of orbital motion is based on [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], which accounts for gravity as due to curvature of [[spacetime|space-time]], with orbits following [[geodesic]]s. For ease of calculation, relativity is commonly approximated by the force-based theory of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal gravitation]] based on [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]].<ref>Kuhn, ''The Copernican Revolution'', pp. 238, 246\u2013252</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Spaceflight sidebar}}\nHistorically, the apparent motions of the planets were described by European and Arabic philosophers using the idea of [[celestial spheres]]. This model posited the existence of perfect moving spheres or rings to which the stars and planets were attached. It assumed the heavens were fixed apart from the motion of the spheres, and was developed without any understanding of gravity.  After the planets' motions were more accurately measured, theoretical mechanisms such as [[deferent and epicycle]]s were added. Although the model was capable of reasonably accurately predicting the planets' positions in the sky, more and more epicycles were required as the measurements became more accurate, hence the model became increasingly unwieldy. Originally [[geocentric model|geocentric ]] it was modified by [[Copernicus]] to place the sun at the centre to help simplify the model. The model was further challenged during the 16th century, as comets were observed traversing the spheres.<ref>''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', 1968, vol. 2, p. 645</ref> <ref>M Caspar, ''Kepler'' (1959, Abelard-Schuman), at pp.131\u2013140; A Koyr\u00e9, ''The Astronomical Revolution: Copernicus, Kepler, Borelli'' (1973, Methuen), pp. 277\u2013279</ref>\n\nThe basis for the modern understanding of orbits was first formulated by [[Johannes Kepler]] whose results are summarised in his three laws of planetary motion. First, he found that the orbits of the planets in our solar system are elliptical, not [[circle|circular]] (or [[epicycle|epicyclic]]), as had previously been believed, and that the Sun is not located at the center of the orbits, but rather at one [[focus (geometry)|focus]].<ref name=\"Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion\">{{cite web|url=http://physics.about.com/od/astronomy/p/keplerlaws.htm|title=Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion|last=Jones|first=Andrew|publisher=[[about.com]]|accessdate=2008-06-01}}</ref> Second, he found that the orbital speed of each planet is not constant, as had previously been thought, but rather that the speed depends on the planet's distance from the Sun. Third, Kepler found a universal relationship between the orbital properties of all the planets orbiting the Sun. For the planets, the cubes of their distances from the Sun are proportional to the squares of their orbital periods. Jupiter and Venus, for example, are respectively about 5.2 and 0.723 [[astronomical unit|AU]] distant from the Sun, their orbital periods respectively about 11.86 and 0.615 years. The proportionality is seen by the fact that the ratio for Jupiter, 5.2<sup>3</sup>/11.86<sup>2</sup>, is practically equal to that for Venus, 0.723<sup>3</sup>/0.615<sup>2</sup>, in accord with the relationship. Idealised orbits meeting these rules are known as [[Kepler orbits]]\n[[File:Conic sections with plane.svg|thumb|right|The lines traced out by orbits dominated by the gravity of a central source are [[conic section]]s: the shapes of the curves of intersection between a plane and a cone. [[Parabolic trajectory|Parabolic]] (1) and [[Hyperbolic trajectory|hyperbolic]] (3) orbits are [[escape velocity|escape]] orbits, whereas [[elliptical]] and [[circle|circular]] orbits (2) are captive.]]\n[[File:Gravity Wells Potential Plus Kinetic Energy - Circle-Ellipse-Parabola-Hyperbola.png|thumb|250px|This image shows the four trajectory categories with the [[gravity well|gravitational potential well]] of the central mass's field of potential energy shown in black and the height of the kinetic energy of the moving body shown in red extending above that, correlating to changes in speed as distance changes according to Kepler's laws.]]\n[[Isaac Newton]] demonstrated that Kepler's laws were derivable from his theory of [[gravitation]] and that, in general, the orbits of bodies subject to gravity were [[conic section]]s (this assumes that the force of gravity propagates instantaneously). Newton showed that, for a pair of bodies, the orbits' sizes are in inverse proportion to their [[mass]]es, and that those bodies orbit their common [[center of mass]]. Where one body is much more massive than the other (as is the case of an artificial satellite orbiting a planet), it is a convenient approximation to take the center of mass as coinciding with the center of the more massive body. \n\nAdvances in Newtonian mechanics were then used to explore variations from the simple assumptions behind Kepler orbits, such as the perturbations due to other bodies, or the impact of spheroidal rather than spherical bodies. [[Lagrange]] (1736\u20131813) developed a [[Lagrangian mechanics|new approach]] to Newtonian mechanics emphasizing energy more than force, and made progress on the three body problem, discovering the [[Lagrangian points]]. In a dramatic vindication of classical mechanics, in 1846 [[le Verrier]] was able to predict the position of [[Neptune]] based on unexplained perturbations in the orbit of [[Uranus]].\n\n[[Albert Einstein]] (1879-1955) in his 1916 paper ''The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity'' explained that gravity was due to curvature of [[space-time]] and removed Newton's assumption that changes propagate instantaneously. This led astronomers to recognize that [[Newtonian mechanics]] did not provide the highest accuracy in understanding orbits. In [[relativity theory]], orbits follow geodesic trajectories which are usually approximated very well by the Newtonian predictions (except where there are very strong gravity fields and very high speeds) but the differences are measurable. Essentially all the experimental evidence that can distinguish between the theories agrees with relativity theory to within experimental measurement accuracy. The original vindication of general relativity is that it was able to account for the remaining unexplained amount in [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|precession of Mercury's perihelion]] first noted by Le Verrier.  However, Newton's solution is still used for most short term purposes since it is significantly easier to use and sufficiently accurate.\n\n==Planetary orbits==\nWithin a [[planetary system]], planets, [[dwarf planet]]s, [[asteroid]]s and other [[minor planet]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[space debris]] orbit the system's [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|barycenter]] in [[elliptical orbit]]s. A comet in a [[Parabolic trajectory|parabolic]] or [[Hyperbolic trajectory|hyperbolic]] orbit about a barycenter is not gravitationally bound to the star and therefore is not considered part of the star's planetary system. Bodies which are gravitationally bound to one of the planets in a planetary system, either [[natural satellite|natural]] or [[satellite|artificial satellites]], follow orbits about a barycenter near or within that planet.\n\nOwing to mutual [[Perturbation (astronomy)|gravitational perturbations]], the [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricities]] of the planetary orbits vary over time. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the smallest planet in the Solar System, has the most eccentric orbit. At the present [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]], [[Mars]] has the next largest eccentricity while the smallest orbital eccentricities are seen with [[Venus]] and [[Neptune]].\n\nAs two objects orbit each other, the [[periapsis]] is that point at which the two objects are closest to each other and the [[apoapsis]] is that point at which they are the farthest. (More specific terms are used for specific bodies. For example, ''perigee'' and ''apogee'' are the lowest and highest parts of an orbit around Earth, while ''perihelion'' and ''aphelion'' are the closest and farthest points of an orbit around the Sun.)\n\nIn the case of planets orbiting a star, the mass of the star and all its satellites are calculated to be at a single point called the barycenter. The paths of all the star's satellites are elliptical orbits about that barycenter. Each satellite in that system will have its own elliptical orbit with the barycenter at one focal point of that ellipse. At any point along its orbit, any satellite will have a certain value of kinetic and potential energy with respect to the barycenter, and that energy is a constant value at every point along its orbit. As a result, as a planet approaches [[periapsis]], the planet will increase in speed as its potential energy decreases; as a planet approaches [[apoapsis]], its velocity will decrease as its potential energy increases.\n\n===Understanding orbits===\n\nThere are a few common ways of understanding orbits:\n* A force, such as gravity, pulls an object into a curved path as it attempts to fly off in a straight line.\n* As the object is pulled toward the massive body, it falls toward that body. However, if it has enough [[tangential velocity]] it will not fall into the body but will instead continue to follow the curved trajectory caused by that body indefinitely. The object is then said to be orbiting the body.\n\nAs an illustration of an orbit around a planet, the [[Newton's cannonball]] model may prove useful (see image below). This is a '[[thought experiment]]', in which a cannon on top of a tall mountain is able to fire a cannonball horizontally at any chosen muzzle velocity. The effects of air friction on the cannonball are ignored (or perhaps the mountain is high enough that the cannon will be above the Earth's atmosphere, which comes to the same thing).<ref>See [https://books.google.com/books?id=rEYUAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA6 pages 6 to 8 in Newton's \"Treatise of the System of the World\"] (written 1685, translated into English 1728, see [[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica#Preliminary version|Newton's 'Principia' \u2013 A preliminary version]]), for the original version of this 'cannonball' thought-experiment.</ref>[[File:Newton Cannon.svg|thumb|300px|[[Newton's cannonball]], an illustration of how objects can \"fall\" in a curve]] [[File:Conic sections, orbits, and gravitational potential.jpg|thumb|400px|Conic sections describe the possible orbits (yellow) of small objects around the Earth. A projection of these orbits onto the gravitational potential (blue) of the Earth makes it possible to determine the orbital energy at each point in space.]]\n\nIf the cannon fires its ball with a low initial velocity, the trajectory of the ball curves downward and hits the ground (A). As the firing velocity is increased, the cannonball hits the ground farther (B) away from the cannon, because while the ball is still falling towards the ground, the ground is increasingly curving away from it (see first point, above). All these motions are actually \"orbits\" in a technical sense \u2013 they are describing a portion of an elliptical path around the center of gravity \u2013 but the orbits are interrupted by striking the Earth.\n\nIf the cannonball is fired with sufficient velocity, the ground curves away from the ball at least as much as the ball falls \u2013 so the ball never strikes the ground. It is now in what could be called a non-interrupted, or circumnavigating, orbit. For any specific combination of height above the center of gravity and mass of the planet, there is one specific firing velocity (unaffected by the mass of the ball, which is assumed to be very small relative to the Earth's mass) that produces a [[circular orbit]], as shown in (C).\n\nAs the firing velocity is increased beyond this, elliptic orbits are produced; one is shown in (D). If the initial firing is above the surface of the Earth as shown, there will also be elliptical orbits at slower velocities; these will come closest to the Earth at the point half an orbit beyond, and directly opposite, the firing point.\n\nAt a specific velocity called [[escape velocity]], dependent on the mass of the planet, an open orbit (E) is achieved that has a [[parabolic trajectory|parabolic path]]. At even greater speeds the object will follow a range of [[hyperbolic trajectory|hyperbolic trajectories]]. In a practical sense, both of these trajectory types mean the object is \"breaking free\" of the planet's gravity, and \"going off into space\" never to return.\n\nThe velocity relationship of two moving objects with mass can thus be considered in four practical classes, with subtypes:\n# ''No orbit''\n# ''[[Sub-orbital spaceflight|Suborbital trajectories]]''\n#* Range of interrupted elliptical paths\n# ''Orbital trajectories (or simply \"orbits\")''\n#* Range of elliptical paths with closest point opposite firing point\n#* Circular path\n#* Range of elliptical paths with closest point at firing point\n# ''[[escape orbit|Open (or escape) trajectories]]''\n#* Parabolic paths\n#* Hyperbolic paths\n\nIt is worth noting that orbital rockets are launched vertically at first to lift the rocket above the atmosphere (which causes frictional drag), and then slowly pitch over and finish firing the rocket engine parallel to the atmosphere to achieve orbit speed.\n\nOnce in orbit, their speed keeps them in orbit above the atmosphere.  If e.g., an elliptical orbit dips into dense air, the object will lose speed and re-enter (i.e. fall). Occasionally a space craft will intentionally intercept the atmosphere, in an act commonly referred to as an aerobraking maneuver\n\n[[File:Orbitalaltitudes.jpg|center|700px]]\n\n==Newton's laws of motion==\n\n===Newton's law of gravitation and laws of motion for two-body problems===\nIn most situations relativistic effects can be neglected, and [[Newton's laws]] give a sufficiently accurate description of motion. The acceleration of a body is equal to the sum of the forces acting on it, divided by its mass, and the gravitational force acting on a body is proportional to the product of the masses of the two attracting bodies and decreases inversely with the square of the distance between them. To this Newtonian approximation, for a system of two point masses or spherical bodies, only influenced by their mutual gravitation (called a [[two-body problem]]), their trajectories can be exactly calculated. If the heavier body is much more massive than the smaller, as in the case of a satellite or small moon orbiting a planet or for the Earth orbiting the Sun, it is accurate enough and convenient to describe the motion in terms of a [[coordinate system]] that is centered on the heavier body, and we say that the lighter body is in orbit around the heavier. For the case where the masses of two bodies are comparable, an exact Newtonian solution is still sufficient and can be had by placing the coordinate system  at the center of mass of the system.\n\n===Defining gravitational potential energy===\nEnergy is associated with [[gravitational fields]]. A stationary body far from another can do external work if it is pulled towards it, and therefore has gravitational ''[[potential energy]]''. Since work is required to separate two bodies against the pull of gravity, their gravitational potential energy increases as they are separated, and decreases as they approach one another. For point masses the gravitational energy decreases to zero as they approach zero separation. It is convenient and conventional to assign the potential energy as having zero value when they are an infinite distance apart, and hence it has a negative value (since it decreases from zero) for smaller finite distances.\n\n===Orbital energies and orbit shapes===\nWhen only two gravitational bodies interact, their orbits follow a [[conic section]]. The orbit can be open (implying the object never returns) or closed (returning). Which it is depends on the total [[energy]] ([[kinetic energy|kinetic]] + [[potential energy]]) of the system. In the case of an open orbit, the speed at any position of the orbit is at least the [[escape velocity]] for that position, in the case of a closed orbit, the speed is always less than the escape velocity. Since the kinetic energy is never negative, if the common convention is adopted of taking the potential energy as zero at infinite separation, the bound orbits will have negative total energy, the parabolic trajectories zero total energy, and hyperbolic orbits positive total energy.\n\nAn open orbit will have a parabolic shape if it has velocity of exactly the escape velocity at that point in its trajectory, and it will have the shape of a [[hyperbola]] when its velocity is greater than the escape velocity. When bodies with escape velocity or greater approach each other, they will briefly curve around each other at the time of their closest approach, and then separate, forever. This may be the case with most comets if they come from outside the solar system.\n\nAll closed orbits have the shape of an [[ellipse]]. A circular orbit is a special case, wherein the foci of the ellipse coincide. The point where the orbiting body is closest to Earth is called the [[perigee]],  and is called the periapsis (less properly, \"perifocus\" or \"pericentron\") when the orbit is about a body other than Earth. The point where the satellite is farthest from Earth is called the [[apogee]], apoapsis, or sometimes apifocus or apocentron. A line drawn from periapsis to apoapsis is the '''[[line of apsides|line-of-apsides]]'''. This is the major axis of the ellipse, the line through its longest part.\n\n===Kepler's laws===\nBodies following closed orbits repeat their paths with a certain time called the period. This motion is described by the empirical laws of Kepler, which can be mathematically derived from Newton's laws. These can be\nformulated as follows:\n\n# The orbit of a planet around the [[Sun]] is an ellipse, with the Sun in one of the focal points of that ellipse. [This focal point is actually the [[barycenter]] of the Sun-planet system; for simplicity this explanation assumes the Sun's mass is infinitely larger than that planet's.] The planet's orbit lies in a plane, called the '''[[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]'''. The point on the orbit closest to the attracting body is the periapsis. The point farthest from the attracting body is called the apoapsis. There are also specific terms for orbits about particular bodies; things orbiting the Sun have a [[perihelion]] and [[aphelion]], things orbiting the Earth have a [[perigee]] and [[apogee]], and things orbiting the [[Moon]] have a [[perilune]] and [[apolune]] (or [[periselene]] and [[aposelene]] respectively). An orbit around any [[star]], not just the Sun, has a [[periastron]] and an [[apastron]].\n# As the planet moves in its orbit, the line from the Sun to planet sweeps a constant area of the [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] for a given period of time, regardless of which part of its orbit the planet traces during that period of time. This means that the planet moves faster near its [[perihelion]] than near its [[aphelion]], because at the smaller distance it needs to trace a greater arc to cover the same area. This law is usually stated as \"equal areas in equal time.\"\n# For a given orbit, the ratio of the cube of its [[semi-major axis]] to the square of its period is constant.\n\n===Limitations of Newton's law of gravitation===\nNote that while bound orbits of a point mass or a spherical body with a [[Newtonian gravitational field]] are closed [[ellipse]]s, which repeat the same path exactly and indefinitely, any non-spherical or non-Newtonian effects (such as caused by the slight oblateness of the [[Earth]], or by [[Theory of relativity|relativistic effects]], thereby changing the gravitational field's behavior with distance) will cause the orbit's shape to depart from the closed [[ellipse]]s characteristic of Newtonian [[two-body motion]]. The two-body solutions were published by Newton in [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]] in 1687. In 1912, [[Karl Fritiof Sundman]] developed a converging infinite series that solves the [[three-body problem]]; however, it converges too slowly to be of much use. Except for special cases like the [[Lagrangian point]]s, no method is known to solve the equations of motion for a system with four or more bodies.\n\n===Approaches to many-body problems===\nRather than an exact closed form solution, orbits with many bodies can be approximated with arbitrarily high accuracy. These approximations take two forms:\n:One form takes the pure elliptic motion as a basis, and adds [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]] terms to account for the gravitational influence of multiple bodies. This is convenient for calculating the positions of astronomical bodies. The equations of motion of the moons, planets and other bodies are known with great accuracy, and are used to generate [[ephemeris|tables]] for [[celestial navigation]]. Still, there are [[secular phenomena]] that have to be dealt with by [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism|post-Newtonian]] methods.\n:The [[differential equation]] form is used for scientific or mission-planning purposes. According to Newton's laws, the sum of all the forces acting on a body will equal the mass of the body times its acceleration (''F = ma''). Therefore accelerations can be expressed in terms of positions. The perturbation terms are much easier to describe in this form. Predicting subsequent positions and velocities from initial values of position and velocity corresponds to solving an [[initial value problem]]. Numerical methods calculate the positions and velocities of the objects a short time in the future, then repeat the calculation ad nauseam. However, tiny arithmetic errors from the limited accuracy of a computer's math are cumulative, which limits the accuracy of this approach.\n\nDifferential simulations with large numbers of objects perform the calculations in a hierarchical pairwise fashion between centers of mass. Using this scheme, galaxies, star clusters and other large assemblages of objects have been simulated.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n== Newtonian analysis of orbital motion ==\n:''(See also [[Kepler orbit]], [[orbit equation]] and [[Kepler's first law]].'')\n\nThe Earth follows an ellipse round the sun.\nBut unlike the ellipse followed by a pendulum or an object attached to a spring, the sun is at a focal point of the ellipse and not at its centre.\n\nThe following derivation applies to such an elliptical orbit.\nWe start only with the [[classical mechanics|Newtonian]] law of gravitation such that the gravitational acceleration towards the central body is related to the inverse of the square of the distance between them.\n\n:eq 1.   <math> F_2 = -\\frac {G  m_1  m_2}{r^2} </math>\n\nWhere F<sub>2</sub> is the force acting on the mass m<sub>2</sub> caused by the gravitational attraction mass m<sub>1</sub> has for m<sub>2</sub>, G is the universal gravitational constant, and r is the distance between the two masses centers.\n\nFrom Newton's Second Law, the summation of the forces acting on m<sub>2</sub> related to that bodies acceleration:\n\n: eq 2.  <math>F_2 = m_2 A_2</math>\n\nWhere A<sub>2</sub> is the acceleration of m<sub>2</sub> caused by the force of gravitational attraction F<sub>2</sub> of m<sub>1</sub> acting on m<sub>2</sub>.\n\nCombining Eq 1 and 2:\n\n: <math> -\\frac {G  m_1  m_2}{r^2} = m_2  A_2 </math>\n\nSolving for the acceleration, A<sub>2</sub>:\n\n: <math>A_2 = \\frac{F_2}{m_2} = - \\frac{1}{m_2} \\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2} =  -\\frac{\\mu}{r^2} </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu\\,</math> is the [[standard gravitational parameter]], in this case <math>G m_1 </math>.

Relativistic effects cease to be negligible when near very massive bodies (as with the [[Kepler problem in general relativity|precession of Mercury's orbit]] about the Sun), or when extreme precision is needed (as with calculations of the [[orbital elements]] and time signal references for [[Global Positioning System#Relativity|GPS]] satellites.<ref>Pogge, Richard W.; [http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html \u201cReal-World Relativity: The GPS Navigation System\u201d]. Retrieved 25 January 2008.</ref>)\n\n==Orbital planes==\n{{Main article|Orbital plane (astronomy)}}\nThe analysis so far has been two dimensional; it turns out that an [[perturbation theory|unperturbed]] orbit is two-dimensional in a plane fixed in space, and thus the extension to three dimensions requires simply rotating the two-dimensional plane into the required angle relative to the poles of the planetary body involved.\n\nThe rotation to do this in three dimensions requires three numbers to uniquely determine; traditionally these are expressed as three angles.\n\n==Orbital period==\n{{Main article|Orbital period}}\nThe orbital period is simply how long an orbiting body takes to complete one orbit.\n\n==Specifying orbits==\n{{Main article|Orbital trajectory}}\n{{see also|Keplerian elements}}\nSix parameters are required to specify a [[Keplerian orbit]] about a body. For example, the three numbers that specify the body's initial position, and the three values that specify its velocity will define a unique orbit that can be calculated forwards (or backwards) in time. However, traditionally the parameters used are slightly different.\n\nThe traditionally used set of orbital elements is called the set of [[Orbital elements|Keplerian elements]], after Johannes Kepler and his laws. The Keplerian elements are six:\n* [[Inclination]] (''i'')\n* [[Longitude of the ascending node]] (\u03a9)\n* [[Argument of periapsis]] (\u03c9)\n* [[orbital eccentricity|Eccentricity]] (''e'')\n* [[Semimajor axis]] (''a'')\n* [[Mean anomaly]] at [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] (''M''<sub>0</sub>).\n\nIn principle once the orbital elements are known for a body, its position can be calculated forward and backwards indefinitely in time. However, in practice, orbits are affected or [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbed]], by other forces than simple gravity from an assumed point source (see the next section), and thus the orbital elements change over time.\n\n==Orbital perturbations==\nAn orbital perturbation is when a force or impulse which is much smaller than the overall force or average impulse of the main gravitating body and which is external to the two orbiting bodies causes an acceleration, which changes the parameters of the orbit over time.\n\n===Radial, prograde and transverse perturbations===\nA small radial impulse given to a body in orbit changes the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]], but not the [[orbital period]] (to first order). A [[Direct motion|prograde]] or [[Retrograde motion|retrograde]] impulse (i.e. an impulse applied along the orbital motion) changes both the eccentricity and the [[orbital period]]. Notably, a prograde impulse at [[periapsis]] raises the altitude at [[apoapsis]], and vice versa, and a retrograde impulse does the opposite. A transverse impulse (out of the orbital plane) causes rotation of the [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] without changing the [[Orbit (dynamics)|period]] or eccentricity. In all instances, a closed orbit will still intersect the perturbation point.\n\n===Orbital decay===\n{{Main article|Orbital decay}}\nIf an orbit is about a planetary body with significant atmosphere, its orbit can decay because of [[drag (physics)|drag]]. Particularly at each [[periapsis]], the object experiences atmospheric drag, losing energy. Each time, the orbit grows less eccentric (more circular) because the object loses kinetic energy precisely when that energy is at its maximum. This is similar to the effect of slowing a pendulum at its lowest point; the highest point of the pendulum's swing becomes lower. With each successive slowing more of the orbit's path is affected by the atmosphere and the effect becomes more pronounced. Eventually, the effect becomes so great that the maximum kinetic energy is not enough to return the orbit above the limits of the atmospheric drag effect. When this happens the body will rapidly spiral down and intersect the central body.\n\nThe bounds of an atmosphere vary wildly. During a [[solar maximum]], the Earth's atmosphere causes drag up to a hundred kilometres higher than during a solar minimum.\n\nSome satellites with long conductive tethers can also experience orbital decay because of electromagnetic drag from the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. As the wire cuts the magnetic field it acts as a generator, moving electrons from one end to the other. The orbital energy is converted to heat in the wire.\n\nOrbits can be artificially influenced through the use of rocket engines which change the kinetic energy of the body at some point in its path. This is the conversion of chemical or electrical energy to kinetic energy. In this way changes in the orbit shape or orientation can be facilitated.\n\nAnother method of artificially influencing an orbit is through the use of [[solar sail]]s or [[magnetic sail]]s. These forms of propulsion require no propellant or energy input other than that of the Sun, and so can be used indefinitely. See [[statite]] for one such proposed use.\n\nOrbital decay can occur due to [[tidal force]]s for objects below the [[synchronous orbit]] for the body they're orbiting. The gravity of the orbiting object raises [[tidal bulge]]s in the primary, and since below the synchronous orbit the orbiting object is moving faster than the body's surface the bulges lag a short angle behind it. The gravity of the bulges is slightly off of the primary-satellite axis and thus has a component along the satellite's motion. The near bulge slows the object more than the far bulge speeds it up, and as a result the orbit decays. Conversely, the gravity of the satellite on the bulges applies [[torque]] on the primary and speeds up its rotation. Artificial satellites are too small to have an appreciable tidal effect on the planets they orbit, but several moons in the solar system are undergoing orbital decay by this mechanism. Mars' innermost moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] is a prime example, and is expected to either impact Mars' surface or break up into a ring within 50 million years.\n\nOrbits can decay via the emission of [[gravitational wave]]s. This mechanism is extremely weak for most stellar objects, only becoming significant in cases where there is a combination of extreme mass and extreme acceleration, such as with [[black hole]]s or [[neutron star]]s that are orbiting each other closely.\n\n===Oblateness===\nThe standard analysis of orbiting bodies assumes that all bodies consist of uniform spheres, or more generally, concentric shells each of uniform density. It can be shown that such bodies are gravitationally equivalent to point sources.\n\nHowever, in the real world, many bodies rotate, and this introduces [[oblateness]] and distorts the gravity field, and gives a [[Quadropole#Gravitational quadrupole|quadrupole]] moment to the gravitational field which is significant at distances comparable to the radius of the body. In the general case, the gravitational potential of a rotating body such as, e.g., a planet is usually expanded in multipoles accounting for the departures of it from spherical symmetry. From the point of view of satellite dynamics, of particular relevance are the so-called even zonal harmonic coefficients, or even zonals, since they induce secular orbital perturbations which are cumulative over time spans longer than the orbital period.<ref>{{cite journal \n|last1=Iorio\n|first1=L.\n|date=2011\n|title=Perturbed stellar motions around the rotating black hole in Sgr A* for a generic orientation of its spin axis\n|journal=[[Physical Review D]]\n |volume=84\n|issue=12\n|pages=124001\n|bibcode=2011PhRvD..84l4001I\n |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.84.124001\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal \n|last1=Renzetti\n|first1=G.\n|date=2013\n|title=Satellite Orbital Precessions Caused by the Octupolar Mass Moment of a Non-Spherical Body Arbitrarily Oriented in Space\n|journal=[[Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy]]\n |volume=34\n|issue=4\n|pages=341\u2013348\n|bibcode=2013JApA...34..341R\n |doi=10.1007/s12036-013-9186-4\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal \n|last1=Renzetti\n|first1=G.\n|date=2014\n|title=Satellite orbital precessions caused by the first odd zonal J3 multipole of a non-spherical body arbitrarily oriented in space\n|journal=[[Astrophysics and Space Science]]\n |volume=352\n|issue=2\n|pages=493\u2013496\n|bibcode=2014Ap&SS.352..493R\n |doi=10.1007/s10509-014-1915-x\n }}</ref> They do depend on the orientation of the body's symmetry axis in the space, affecting, in general, the whole orbit, with the exception of the semimajor axis.\n\n===Multiple gravitating bodies===\n{{Main article|n-body problem}}\nThe effects of other gravitating bodies can be significant. For example, the [[orbit of the Moon]] cannot be accurately described without allowing for the action of the Sun's gravity as well as the Earth's. One approximate result is that bodies will usually have reasonably stable orbits around a heavier planet or moon, in spite of these perturbations, provided they are orbiting well within the heavier body's [[Hill sphere]].\n\nWhen there are more than two gravitating bodies it is referred to as an [[n-body problem]]. Most n-body problems have no [[closed form solution]], although some special cases have been formulated.\n\n===Light radiation and stellar wind===\nFor smaller bodies particularly, light and [[stellar wind]] can cause significant perturbations to the attitude and direction of motion of the body, and over time can be significant. Of the planetary bodies, the motion of [[asteroid]]s is particularly affected over large periods when the asteroids are rotating relative to the Sun.\n\n==Astrodynamics==\n{{Main article|Orbital mechanics}}\n'''Orbital mechanics''' or '''astrodynamics''' is the application of [[ballistics]] and [[celestial mechanics]] to the practical problems concerning the motion of [[rocket]]s and other [[spacecraft]]. The motion of these objects is usually calculated from [[Newton's laws of motion]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]]. It is a core discipline within space mission design and control. Celestial mechanics treats more broadly the orbital dynamics of systems under the influence of [[gravity]], including spacecraft and natural astronomical bodies such as star systems, [[planet]]s, [[moon]]s, and [[comet]]s. Orbital mechanics focuses on spacecraft [[trajectory|trajectories]], including [[orbital maneuver]]s, orbit plane changes, and interplanetary transfers, and is used by mission planners to predict the results of [[Spacecraft propulsion|propulsive maneuvers]]. [[General relativity]] is a more exact theory than Newton's laws for calculating orbits, and is sometimes necessary for greater accuracy or in high-gravity situations (such as orbits close to the Sun).\n\n==Earth orbits==\n{{Main article|List of orbits}}\n* [[Low Earth orbit]] (LEO): [[Geocentric orbit]]s with altitudes up to 2,000 [[km]] (0\u20131,240 [[mile]]s).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/NSS1740_14/nss1740_14-1995.pdf |format=PDF| title=NASA Safety Standard 1740.14, Guidelines and Assessment Procedures for Limiting Orbital Debris|publisher=Office of Safety and Mission Assurance|date=1 August 1995}}, pages 37-38 (6-1,6-2); figure 6-1.</ref>\n* [[Medium Earth orbit]] (MEO): [[Geocentric orbit]]s ranging in altitude from 2,000 [[km]] (1,240 [[mile]]s) to just below [[geosynchronous orbit]] at {{convert|35786|km|mi|sp=us}}.

This corresponds to the following properties.\n\n[[Scale factor|Scaling]] of distances (including sizes of bodies, while keeping the densities the same) gives [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] orbits without scaling the time: if for example distances are halved, masses are divided by 8, gravitational forces by 16 and gravitational accelerations by 2. Hence velocities are halved and orbital periods remain the same. Similarly, when an object is dropped from a tower, the time it takes to fall to the ground remains the same with a scale model of the tower on a scale model of the Earth.\n\nScaling of distances while keeping the masses the same (in the case of point masses, or by reducing the densities) gives similar orbits; if distances are multiplied by 4, gravitational forces and accelerations are divided by 16, velocities are halved and orbital periods are multiplied by 8.\n\nWhen all densities are multiplied by 4, orbits are the same; gravitational forces are multiplied by 16 and accelerations by 4, velocities are doubled and orbital periods are halved.\n\nWhen all densities are multiplied by 4, and all sizes are halved, orbits are similar; masses are divided by 2, gravitational forces are the same, gravitational accelerations are doubled.
