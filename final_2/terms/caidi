In other words,\n\n<math>\\mbox{CAIDI} = \\frac{\\mbox{sum of all customer interruption durations}}{\\mbox{total number of customer interruptions}} = \\frac{\\mbox{SAIDI}}{\\mbox{SAIFI}}</math>\n\nCAIDI gives the average outage duration that any given customer would experience. CAIDI can also be viewed as the average restoration time.\n\nCAIDI is measured in units of time, often minutes or hours. It is usually measured over the course of a year, and according to IEEE Standard 1366-1998 the median value for North American utilities is approximately 1.36 hours.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Average Service Availability Index]] (ASAI)\n* [[ASIDI]]\n* [[ASIFI]]\n* [[ASUI]]\n* CAIDI\n* [[CAIFI]]\n* [[CTAIDI]]\n* [[MAIFI]]\n* [[SAIDI]]\n* [[SAIFI]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Caidi}}\n[[Category:Electric power]]\n[[Category:Reliability analysis]]"}]}}}}
