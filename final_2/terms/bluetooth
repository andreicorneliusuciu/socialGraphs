The idea of this name was proposed in 1997 by [[Jim Kardach]] who developed a system that would allow mobile phones to communicate with computers.

Bluetooth uses a radio technology called [[frequency-hopping spread spectrum]]. Bluetooth divides transmitted data into packets, and transmits each packet on one of 79 designated Bluetooth channels. Each channel has a bandwidth of 1&nbsp;MHz. It usually performs 800&nbsp;hops per second, with [[Frequency-hopping spread spectrum#Variations of FHSS|Adaptive Frequency-Hopping]] (AFH) enabled.<ref name=\"Radio-Electronics.com\"/> [[Bluetooth low energy]] uses 2&nbsp;MHz spacing, which accommodates 40 channels.\n\nOriginally, [[Gaussian frequency-shift keying]] (GFSK) modulation was the only modulation scheme available. Since the introduction of Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, \u03c0/4-[[DQPSK]] (Differential Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) and 8DPSK modulation may also be used between compatible devices. Devices functioning with GFSK are said to be operating in basic rate (BR) mode where an instantaneous [[Bit rate|data rate]] of 1&nbsp;[[Data rate units|Mbit/s]] is possible. The term Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) is used to describe \u03c0/4-DPSK and 8DPSK schemes, each giving 2 and 3&nbsp;Mbit/s respectively. The combination of these (BR and EDR) modes in Bluetooth radio technology is classified as a \"BR/EDR radio\".\n\nBluetooth is a [[Packet based|packet-based protocol]] with a [[Master-slave (technology)|master-slave structure]]. One master may communicate with up to seven slaves in a [[piconet]]. All devices share the master's clock. Packet exchange is based on the basic clock, defined by the master, which ticks at 312.5&nbsp;\u00b5s intervals. Two clock ticks make up a slot of 625&nbsp;[[\u00b5s]], and two slots make up a slot pair of 1250&nbsp;\u00b5s. In the simple case of single-slot packets the master transmits in even slots and receives in odd slots. The slave, conversely, receives in even slots and transmits in odd slots. Packets may be 1, 3 or 5 slots long, but in all cases the master's transmission begins in even slots and the slave's in odd slots.\n\nThe above is valid for \"classic\" BT. Bluetooth Low Energy, introduced in the 4.0 specification, uses the same spectrum but somewhat differently; see [[Bluetooth low energy#Radio interface]].\n\n===Communication and connection===\nA master Bluetooth device can communicate with a maximum of seven devices in a piconet (an ad-hoc computer network using Bluetooth technology), though not all devices reach this maximum.<!-- This sentence contains redundant text, repeated from previous paragraph. --> The devices can switch roles, by agreement, and the slave can become the master (for example, a headset initiating a connection to a phone necessarily begins as master\u2014as initiator of the connection\u2014but may subsequently operate as slave).\n\nThe Bluetooth Core Specification provides for the connection of two or more piconets to form a [[scatternet]], in which certain devices simultaneously play the master role in one piconet and the slave role in another.\n\nAt any given time, data can be transferred between the master and one other device (except for the little-used broadcast mode.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}) The master chooses which slave device to address; typically, it switches rapidly from one device to another in a [[round-robin scheduling|round-robin]] fashion. Since it is the master that chooses which slave to address, whereas a slave is (in theory) supposed to listen in each receive slot, being a master is a lighter burden than being a slave. Being a master of seven slaves is possible; being a slave of more than one master is only possible on more advanced devices which conform with Bluetooth 4.1 onwards.<ref name=sensors>{{cite journal|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/12/9/11734/pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.3390/s120911734|periodical=Sensors|number=12(9) 11734-11753|orig-year=2012|title=Overview and Evaluation of Bluetooth Low Energy: An Emerging Low-Power Wireless Technology|last1=Gomez|first1=C|last2=Oller|first2=J|last3=Paradells|first3=J|quote=A master can manage multiple simultaneous connections with different slaves, whereas each slave can only be connected to one master}}</ref><ref name=ietf>{{cite IETF| title = Transmission of IPv6 Packets over BLUETOOTH Low Energy| draft = draft-ietf-6lo-btle-17| sectionname = Link layer roles and topology| page = 5| year = 2016| month = February| publisher = [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]| url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-6lo-btle-17#section-2.3| accessdate =October 20, 2009| quote=A device in the central role, which is called central from now on, has traditionally been able to manage multiple simultaneous connections with a number of devices in the peripheral role, called peripherals from now on.

Most Bluetooth applications are battery powered Class&nbsp;2 devices, with little difference in range whether the other end of the link is a Class&nbsp;1 or Class&nbsp;2 device as the lower powered device tends to set the range limit.

Wi-Fi is intended as a replacement for high speed cabling for general [[local area network]] access in work areas or home. This category of applications is sometimes called [[wireless local area network]]s (WLAN). Bluetooth was intended for portable equipment and its applications. The category of applications is outlined as the wireless [[personal area network]] (WPAN). Bluetooth is a replacement for cabling in a variety of personally carried applications in any setting, and also works for fixed location applications such as smart energy functionality in the home (thermostats, etc.).\n\nWi-Fi and Bluetooth are to some extent complementary in their applications and usage. Wi-Fi is usually access point-centered, with an asymmetrical client-server connection with all traffic routed through the access point, while Bluetooth is usually symmetrical, between two Bluetooth devices. Bluetooth serves well in simple applications where two devices need to connect with minimal configuration like a button press, as in headsets and remote controls, while Wi-Fi suits better in applications where some degree of client configuration is possible and high speeds are required, especially for network access through an access node. However, Bluetooth access points do exist and ad-hoc connections are possible with Wi-Fi though not as simply as with Bluetooth. [[Wi-Fi Direct]] was recently developed to add a more Bluetooth-like ad-hoc functionality to Wi-Fi.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Devices===\n[[File:Drone 4.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A Bluetooth [[USB]] dongle with a 100&nbsp;m range.]]\nBluetooth exists in many products, such as telephones, tablets, media players, robotics systems, handheld, laptops and console gaming equipment, and some high definition [[Headset (audio)|headsets]], [[modem]]s, and watches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/English/Products/Pages/Watch.aspx |title=Watch |publisher=Bluetooth.com |accessdate=4 September 2010}}</ref> The technology is useful when transferring information between two or more devices that are near each other in low-bandwidth situations.

Bluetooth v3.0 + HS provides theoretical data transfer speeds of up to 24 Mbit/s, though not over the Bluetooth link itself. Instead, the Bluetooth link is used for negotiation and establishment, and the high data rate traffic is carried over a colocated [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]] link.\n\nThe main new feature is AMP (Alternative MAC/PHY), the addition of [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]] as a high speed transport. The High-Speed part of the specification is not mandatory, and hence only devices that display the \"+HS\" logo actually support Bluetooth over 802.11 high-speed data transfer. A Bluetooth v3.0 device without the \"+HS\" suffix is only required to support features introduced in Core Specification Version 3.0<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=40560|title=Bluetooth Core Version 3.0 + HS specification}}</ref> or earlier Core Specification Addendum 1.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.bluetooth.org/DocMan/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=119993|title=Bluetooth Core Specification Addendum (CSA) 1}}</ref>\n\n;[[#L2CAP|L2CAP]] Enhanced modes: Enhanced Retransmission Mode (ERTM) implements reliable L2CAP channel, while Streaming Mode (SM) implements unreliable channel with no retransmission or flow control. Introduced in Core Specification Addendum 1.\n;Alternative MAC/PHY: Enables the use of alternative [[Media Access Control|MAC]] and [[PHY]]s for transporting Bluetooth profile data. The Bluetooth radio is still used for device discovery, initial connection and profile configuration. However, when large quantities of data must be sent, the high speed alternative MAC PHY 802.11 (typically associated with Wi-Fi) transports the data. This means that Bluetooth uses proven low power connection models when the system is idle, and the faster radio when it must send large quantities of data. AMP links require enhanced L2CAP modes.\n;Unicast Connectionless Data: Permits sending service data without establishing an explicit L2CAP channel. It is intended for use by applications that require low latency between user action and reconnection/transmission of data. This is only appropriate for small amounts of data.\n;Enhanced Power Control: Updates the power control feature to remove the open loop power control, and also to clarify ambiguities in power control introduced by the new modulation schemes added for EDR. Enhanced power control removes the ambiguities by specifying the behaviour that is expected. The feature also adds closed loop power control, meaning RSSI filtering can start as the response is received. Additionally, a \"go straight to maximum power\" request has been introduced. This is expected to deal with the headset link loss issue typically observed when a user puts their phone into a pocket on the opposite side to the headset.\n\n====Ultra-wideband====\nThe high speed (AMP) feature of Bluetooth v3.0 was originally intended for [[Ultra-wideband|UWB]], but the WiMedia Alliance, the body responsible for the flavor of UWB intended for Bluetooth, announced in March 2009 that it was disbanding, and ultimately UWB was omitted from the Core v3.0 specification.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://news.zdnet.co.uk/communications/0,1000000085,39643174,00.htm\n|title= Bluetooth 3.0 released without ultrawideband\n|author=David Meyer\n|date=22 April 2009\n|publisher=zdnet.co.uk\n|accessdate=22 April 2009\n}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 March 2009, the [[WiMedia Alliance]] announced it was entering into technology transfer agreements for the WiMedia [[Ultra-wideband]] (UWB) specifications.

(2005). ''Wireless communications & networks.'=' Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall.''</ref> Mandatory protocols for all Bluetooth stacks are: LMP, L2CAP and SDP. In addition, devices that communicate with Bluetooth almost universally can use these protocols: [[Bluetooth protocols#Host/controller interface (HCI)|HCI]] and RFCOMM.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n====LMP====\nThe ''Link Management Protocol'' (LMP) is used for set-up and control of the radio link between two devices. Implemented on the controller.\n\n====L2CAP====\nThe ''Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol'' (L2CAP) is used to multiplex multiple logical connections between two devices using different higher level protocols.\nProvides segmentation and reassembly of on-air packets.\n\nIn ''Basic'' mode, L2CAP provides packets with a payload configurable up to 64&nbsp;kB, with 672 bytes as the default [[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]], and 48 bytes as the minimum mandatory supported MTU.\n\nIn ''Retransmission and Flow Control'' modes, L2CAP can be configured either for isochronous data or reliable data per channel by performing retransmissions and CRC checks.\n\nBluetooth Core Specification Addendum 1 adds two additional L2CAP modes to the core specification. These modes effectively deprecate original Retransmission and Flow Control modes:\n* '''Enhanced Retransmission Mode''' (ERTM): This mode is an improved version of the original retransmission mode. This mode provides a reliable L2CAP channel.\n* '''Streaming Mode''' (SM): This is a very simple mode, with no retransmission or flow control. This mode provides an unreliable L2CAP channel.\n\nReliability in any of these modes is optionally and/or additionally guaranteed by the lower layer Bluetooth BDR/EDR air interface by configuring the number of retransmissions and flush timeout (time after which the radio flushes packets). In-order sequencing is guaranteed by the lower layer.\n\nOnly L2CAP channels configured in ERTM or SM may be operated over AMP logical links.\n\n====SDP====\nThe ''Service Discovery Protocol'' (SDP) allows a device to discover services offered by other devices, and their associated parameters. For example, when you use a mobile phone with a Bluetooth headset, the phone uses SDP to determine which [[Bluetooth profile]]s the headset can use (Headset Profile, Hands Free Profile, [[Advanced Audio Distribution Profile|Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP)]] etc.) and the protocol multiplexer settings needed for the phone to connect to the headset using each of them. Each service is identified by a [[Universally Unique Identifier]] (UUID), with official services (Bluetooth profiles) assigned a short form UUID (16 bits rather than the full 128).\n\n====RFCOMM====\n''Radio Frequency Communications'' (RFCOMM) is a cable replacement protocol used to generate a virtual serial data stream. RFCOMM provides for binary data transport and emulates [[EIA-232]] (formerly RS-232) control signals over the Bluetooth baseband layer, i.e. it is a serial port emulation.\n\nRFCOMM provides a simple reliable data stream to the user, similar to TCP. It is used directly by many telephony related profiles as a carrier for AT commands, as well as being a transport layer for OBEX over Bluetooth.\n\nMany Bluetooth applications use RFCOMM because of its widespread support and publicly available API on most operating systems. Additionally, applications that used a serial port to communicate can be quickly ported to use RFCOMM.\n\n====BNEP====\nThe ''Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol'' (BNEP) is used for transferring another protocol stack's data via an L2CAP channel.\nIts main purpose is the transmission of IP packets in the Personal Area Networking Profile.\nBNEP performs a similar function to [[Subnetwork Access Protocol|SNAP]] in Wireless LAN.\n\n====AVCTP====\nThe ''Audio/Video Control Transport Protocol'' (AVCTP) is used by the remote control profile to transfer AV/C commands over an L2CAP channel. The music control buttons on a stereo headset use this protocol to control the music player.\n\n====AVDTP====\nThe ''Audio/Video Distribution Transport Protocol'' (AVDTP) is used by the advanced audio distribution profile to stream music to stereo headsets over an L2CAP channel intended for video distribution profile in the Bluetooth transmission.\n\n====TCS====\nThe ''Telephony Control Protocol&nbsp;\u2013 Binary'' (TCS BIN) is the bit-oriented protocol that defines the call control signaling for the establishment of voice and data calls between Bluetooth devices. Additionally, \"TCS BIN defines mobility management procedures for handling groups of Bluetooth TCS devices.\"\n\nTCS-BIN is only used by the cordless telephony profile, which failed to attract implementers. As such it is only of historical interest.\n\n====Adopted protocols====\nAdopted protocols are defined by other standards-making organizations and incorporated into Bluetooth\u2019s protocol stack, allowing Bluetooth to code protocols only when necessary. The adopted protocols include:\n*'''[[Point-to-Point Protocol]] (PPP)''': Internet standard protocol for transporting [[IP datagram]]s over a point-to-point link.\n*'''[[TCP/IP]]/UDP''': Foundation Protocols for TCP/IP protocol suite\n*'''[[OBject EXchange|Object Exchange Protocol]] (OBEX)''': Session-layer protocol for the exchange of objects, providing a model for object and operation representation\n*'''[[Wireless Application Protocol|Wireless Application Environment/Wireless Application Protocol]] (WAE/WAP)''': WAE specifies an application framework for wireless devices and WAP is an open standard to provide mobile users access to telephony and information services.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\n===Baseband error correction===\nDepending on packet type, individual packets may be protected by [[error correction]], either 1/3 rate [[forward error correction]] (FEC) or 2/3 rate. In addition, packets with CRC will be retransmitted until acknowledged by [[automatic repeat request]] (ARQ).\n\n===Setting up connections===\nAny Bluetooth device in ''discoverable mode'' transmits the following information on demand:\n* Device name\n* Device class\n* List of services\n* Technical information (for example: device features, manufacturer, Bluetooth specification used, clock offset)\n\nAny device may perform an inquiry to find other devices to connect to, and any device can be configured to respond to such inquiries. However, if the device trying to connect knows the address of the device, it always responds to direct connection requests and transmits the information shown in the list above if requested. Use of a device's services may require pairing or acceptance by its owner, but the connection itself can be initiated by any device and held until it goes out of range. Some devices can be connected to only one device at a time, and connecting to them prevents them from connecting to other devices and appearing in inquiries until they disconnect from the other device.\n\nEvery device has a unique 48-bit address. However, these addresses are generally not shown in inquiries. Instead, friendly Bluetooth names are used, which can be set by the user. This name appears when another user scans for devices and in lists of paired devices.\n\nMost cellular phones have the Bluetooth name set to the manufacturer and model of the phone by default. Most cellular phones and laptops show only the Bluetooth names and special programs are required to get additional information about remote devices. This can be confusing as, for example, there could be several cellular phones in range named [[Sony Ericsson T610|T610]] (see [[Bluejacking]]).\n\n{{anchor|Pairing}}\n\n===Pairing and bonding===\n\n====Motivation====\nMany services offered over Bluetooth can expose private data or let a connecting party control the Bluetooth device. Security reasons make it necessary to recognize specific devices, and thus enable control over which devices can connect to a given Bluetooth device. At the same time, it is useful for Bluetooth devices to be able to establish a connection without user intervention (for example, as soon as in range).\n\nTo resolve this conflict, Bluetooth uses a process called ''bonding'', and a bond is generated through a process called ''pairing''. The pairing process is triggered either by a specific request from a user to generate a bond (for example, the user explicitly requests to \"Add a Bluetooth device\"), or it is triggered automatically when connecting to a service where (for the first time) the identity of a device is required for security purposes. These two cases are referred to as dedicated bonding and general bonding respectively.\n\nPairing often involves some level of user interaction. This user interaction confirms the identity of the devices. When pairing successfully completes, a bond forms between the two devices, enabling those two devices to connect to each other in the future without repeating the pairing process to confirm device identities. When desired, the user can remove the bonding relationship.\n\n====Implementation====\nDuring pairing, the two devices establish a relationship by creating a [[shared secret]] known as a ''link key''. If both devices store the same link key, they are said to be ''paired'' or ''bonded''. A device that wants to communicate only with a bonded device can [[cryptography|cryptographically]] [[authentication|authenticate]] the identity of the other device, ensuring it is the same device it previously paired with. Once a link key is generated, an authenticated [[Asynchronous Connection-Less]] (ACL) link between the devices may be [[encryption|encrypted]] to protect exchanged data against [[eavesdropping]]. Users can delete link keys from either device, which removes the bond between the devices\u2014so it is possible for one device to have a stored link key for a device it is no longer paired with.\n\nBluetooth services generally require either encryption or authentication and as such require pairing before they let a remote device connect. Some services, such as the Object Push Profile, elect not to explicitly require authentication or encryption so that pairing does not interfere with the user experience associated with the service use-cases.\n\n====Pairing mechanisms====\nPairing mechanisms changed significantly with the introduction of Secure Simple Pairing in Bluetooth v2.1. The following summarizes the pairing mechanisms:\n* ''Legacy pairing'': This is the only method available in Bluetooth v2.0 and before. Each device must enter a [[Personal identification number|PIN code]]; pairing is only successful if both devices enter the same PIN code. Any 16-byte UTF-8 string may be used as a PIN code; however, not all devices may be capable of entering all possible PIN codes.\n** ''Limited input devices'': The obvious example of this class of device is a Bluetooth Hands-free headset, which generally have few inputs. These devices usually have a ''fixed PIN'', for example \"0000\" or \"1234\", that are hard-coded into the device.\n** ''Numeric input devices'': Mobile phones are classic examples of these devices. They allow a user to enter a numeric value up to 16 digits in length.\n** ''Alpha-numeric input devices'': PCs and smartphones are examples of these devices. They allow a user to enter full UTF-8 text as a PIN code. If pairing with a less capable device the user must be aware of the input limitations on the other device, there is no mechanism available for a capable device to determine how it should limit the available input a user may use.\n* ''Secure Simple Pairing'' (SSP): This is required by Bluetooth v2.1, although a Bluetooth v2.1 device may only use legacy pairing to interoperate with a v2.0 or earlier device. Secure Simple Pairing uses a form of [[public key cryptography]], and some types can help protect against [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man in the middle]], or MITM attacks. SSP has the following authentication mechanisms:\n** ''Just works'': As the name implies, this method just works, with no user interaction. However, a device may prompt the user to confirm the pairing process. This method is typically used by headsets with very limited IO capabilities, and is more secure than the fixed PIN mechanism this limited set of devices uses for legacy pairing. This method provides no man-in-the-middle (MITM) protection.\n** ''Numeric comparison'': If both devices have a display, and at least one can accept a binary yes/no user input, they may use Numeric Comparison. This method displays a 6-digit numeric code on each device. The user should compare the numbers to ensure they are identical. If the comparison succeeds, the user(s) should confirm pairing on the device(s) that can accept an input. This method provides MITM protection, assuming the user confirms on both devices and actually performs the comparison properly.\n** ''Passkey Entry'': This method may be used between a device with a display and a device with numeric keypad entry (such as a keyboard), or two devices with numeric keypad entry. In the first case, the display is used to show a 6-digit numeric code to the user, who then enters the code on the keypad. In the second case, the user of each device enters the same 6-digit number. Both of these cases provide MITM protection.\n** ''Out of band'' (OOB): This method uses an external means of communication, such as [[Near Field Communication]] (NFC) to exchange some information used in the pairing process. Pairing is completed using the Bluetooth radio, but requires information from the OOB mechanism. This provides only the level of MITM protection that is present in the OOB mechanism.\n\nSSP is considered simple for the following reasons:\n* In most cases, it does not require a user to generate a passkey.\n* For use-cases not requiring MITM protection, user interaction can be eliminated.\n* For ''numeric comparison'', MITM protection can be achieved with a simple equality comparison by the user.\n* Using OOB with NFC enables pairing when devices simply get close, rather than requiring a lengthy discovery process.\n\n====Security concerns====\nPrior to Bluetooth v2.1, encryption is not required and can be turned off at any time. Moreover, the encryption key is only good for approximately 23.5 hours; using a single encryption key longer than this time allows simple [[Stream cipher attack|XOR attacks]] to retrieve the encryption key.\n* Turning off encryption is required for several normal operations, so it is problematic to detect if encryption is disabled for a valid reason or for a security attack.\nBluetooth v2.1 addresses this in the following ways:\n* Encryption is required for all non-SDP (Service Discovery Protocol) connections\n* A new Encryption Pause and Resume feature is used for all normal operations that require that encryption be disabled. This enables easy identification of normal operation from security attacks.\n* The encryption key must be refreshed before it expires.\nLink keys may be stored on the device file system, not on the Bluetooth chip itself. Many Bluetooth chip manufacturers let link keys be stored on the device\u2014however, if the device is removable, this means that the link key moves with the device.\n\n== Security ==\n\n===Overview===\n{{see also|Mobile security#Attacks based on communication networks}}\nBluetooth implements [[confidentiality]], [[authentication]] and [[key (cryptography)|key]] derivation with custom algorithms based on the [[SAFER|SAFER+]] [[block cipher]]. Bluetooth key generation is generally based on a Bluetooth PIN, which must be entered into both devices. This procedure might be modified if one of the devices has a fixed PIN (e.g., for headsets or similar devices with a restricted user interface). During pairing, an initialization key or master key is generated, using the E22 algorithm.<ref>{{cite web\n|author=Juha T.

The virus was written as a proof-of-concept by a group of virus writers known as \"29A\" and sent to anti-virus groups. Thus, it should be regarded as a potential (but not real) security threat to Bluetooth technology or [[Symbian OS]] since the virus has never spread outside of this system. In August 2004, a world-record-setting experiment (see also [[Bluetooth sniping]]) showed that the range of Class&nbsp;2 Bluetooth radios could be extended to {{convert|1.78|km|mi|abbr=on}} with directional antennas and signal amplifiers.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Long Distance Snarf\n|publisher=Trifinite.org\n|url=http://trifinite.org/trifinite_stuff_lds.html\n|accessdate=1 February 2007\n}}</ref>\nThis poses a potential security threat because it enables attackers to access vulnerable Bluetooth devices from a distance beyond expectation.

The worm is self-installing and begins once the mobile user approves the transfer of the file (velasco.sis) from another device. Once installed, the worm begins looking for other Bluetooth enabled devices to infect. Additionally, the worm infects other [[.SIS]]&nbsp;files on the device, allowing replication to another device through use of removable media ([[Secure Digital]], [[Compact Flash]], etc.).

The passive attack allows a suitably equipped attacker to eavesdrop on communications and spoof, if the attacker was present at the time of initial pairing.

After that, the first method can be used to crack the PIN. This attack's major weakness is that it requires the user of the devices under attack to re-enter the PIN during the attack when the device prompts them to.
