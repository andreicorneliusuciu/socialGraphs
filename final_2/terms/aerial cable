As aerial cables are completely insulated there is no danger of [[electric shock]] when touching them and there is no requirement for mounting them with [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]] on pylons and poles.\nA further advantage is they require less right of way than overhead lines for the same reason.  They can be designed as [[shielded cable]]s for telecommunication purposes. If the cable falls, it may still operate if its insulation is not damaged.  \n\nAs aerial cables are installed on pylons or poles, they may be cheaper to install than [[undergrounding|underground cable]]s, as no work for digging is required, which can be very expensive in rocky areas.\n\n== Use ==\nAerial cables are mostly used for telecommunication systems or for power transmissions with voltages below 1000 volts. Aerial cable for voltages around 10000 volts have also been built,  for the supply of farms, waterworks, transmitters and other facilities outside urban areas. A further common use is the replacement of overhead telecommunication lines, for example, along railway line, by aerial cables as they can be installed on existing poles and make the facility more reliable.\n\nTelecommunication systems running along power lines or aerial tramways are often built as aerial cables as they can be easily installed on the pylons or tramway support towers. However these cables must be designed for higher forces as span lengths are longer.\n\nAs power lines the aerial cable can serve also as ground conductor on the top of the pylon. It can be also installed in form of a separate strand on the conductor. A special method was used at former EVS (now EnBW) in Germany until the mid-1980s, where the aerial cable was installed like a garland on the ground conductor or an auxiliary rope.\n\n[[Image:Evsl1.jpg|thumb|Aerial cable spun like a garland on a 110kV-powerline of EnBW AG near Leonberg in Germany]]\n\nFor reasons of electromagnetic interference aerial cables running along power lines are most often of fibre optic types. As these are dielectric, it is even possible to install them directly in the conductors&mdash;see [[optical ground wire]].\n \nAerial cables are also used sometimes for power transmission from the transmitter building to the antenna at radio stations.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Aerial insert]]\n* [[Overhead power line]]\n\n[[Category:Power cables]]\n[[Category:Electric power distribution]]\n\n[[de:Luftkabel]]"}]}}}}
