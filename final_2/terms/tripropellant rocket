Tripropellant rockets appear to offer fairly impressive gains for [[single stage to orbit]] designs, although to date no tripropellant rocket design has been developed to the point of testing that would prove the concept.\n\n== Simultaneous burn ==\nThere are two principally different kinds of tripropellant rockets.  One is a rocket engine which mixes three separate streams of propellants. In the 1960s, Rocketdyne fired an engine using a mixture of liquid [[lithium]], gaseous [[hydrogen]], and liquid [[fluorine]] to produce a [[specific impulse]] of 542 seconds, likely the highest measured such value for a chemical rocket motor.<ref>{{Cite book\n| title = Ignition!

In this way the motor can combine the high thrust of a dense fuel like [[kerosene]] early in flight with the high specific impulse of a lighter fuel like [[liquid hydrogen]] (LH2) later in flight. The result is a single engine providing some of the benefits of [[Staging (rocketry)|staging]].\n\nFor example, injecting a small amount of liquid hydrogen into a Kerosene burning engine can yield significant specific impulse improvements without compromising propellant density. This was demonstrated by the [[RD-701]] achieving a specific impulse of 415 seconds in vacuum (higher than the pure LH2/LOX [[RS-68]]), where a pure kerosene engine with a similar expansion ratio would achieve 330\u2013340 seconds.\n\nAlthough liquid hydrogen delivers the largest specific impulse of the plausible rocket fuels, it also requires huge structures to hold it due to its low density. These structures can weigh a lot, offsetting the light weight of the fuel itself to some degree, and also result in higher drag while in the atmosphere. While kerosene has lower specific impulse, its higher density results in smaller structures, which reduces stage mass, and furthermore reduces losses to [[atmospheric drag]]. In addition, kerosene-based engines generally provide higher [[thrust]], which is important for takeoff, reducing [[gravity drag]]. So in general terms there is a \"sweet spot\" in altitude where one type of fuel becomes more practical than the other.\n\nTraditional rocket designs use this sweet spot to their advantage via staging. For instance the [[Saturn V]]s used a lower stage powered by [[RP-1]] (kerosene) and upper stages powered by LH2. Some of the early [[Space Shuttle]] design efforts used similar designs, with one stage using kerosene into the upper atmosphere, where an LH2 powered upper stage would light and go on from there. The later Shuttle design is somewhat similar, although it used solid rockets for its lower stages.\n\nSSTO rockets could simply carry two sets of engines, but this would mean the spacecraft would be carrying one or the other set \"turned off\" for most of the flight. With light enough engines this might be reasonable, but an SSTO design requires a very high [[propellant mass fraction|mass fraction]] and so has razor-thin margins for extra weight.\n\nAt liftoff the engine typically burns both fuels, gradually changing the mixture over altitude in order to keep the exhaust plume \"tuned\" (a strategy similar in concept to the [[plug nozzle]] but using a normal bell), eventually switching entirely to LH2 once the kerosene is burned off. At that point the engine is largely a straight LH2/LOX engine, with an extra fuel pump hanging onto it.\n\nThe concept was first explored in the US by Robert Salkeld, who published the first study on the concept in ''Mixed-Mode Propulsion for the Space Shuttle'', Astronautics & Aeronautics August 1971. He studied a number of designs using such engines, both ground based and a number that were air-launched from large jet aircraft. He concluded that tripropellant engines would produce gains of over 100% in [[payload fraction]], reductions of over 65% in propellant volume and  better than 20% in dry weight. A second design series studied the replacement of the Shuttles [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|SRBs]] with tripropellant based boosters, in which case the engine almost halved the overall weight of the designs. His last full study was on the ''Orbital Rocket Airplane'' which used both tripropellant and (in some versions) a plug nozzle, resulting in a spaceship only slightly larger than a [[Lockheed SR-71]], able to operate from traditional runways.\n\nTripropellant engines  were built in [[Russia]]. Kosberg and Glushko developed a number of experimental engines in 1988 for a [[SSTO]] [[spaceplane]] called [[MAKS space plane|MAKS]], but both the engines and MAKS were cancelled in 1991 due to a lack of funding. Glushko's [[RD-701]] was built and test fired, however, and although there were some problems, [[Energomash]] feels that the problems are entirely solvable and that the design does represent one way to reduce launch costs by about 10 times.\n\n==References==\n{{No footnotes|article|date=March 2009}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.abo.fi/~mlindroo/SpaceLVs/Slides/sld039.htm |title=ROBERT STALKELD'S |accessdate=2009-03-05 }}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}\n*[http://www.astronautix.com/engines/rd701.htm RD-701]\n\n{{spacecraft propulsion}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tripropellant Rocket}}\n[[Category:Rocket propulsion]]\n[[Category:Rocket engines]]\n[[Category:Rocket engines using hydrogen propellant]]\n[[Category:Rocket engines using kerosene propellant]]\n[[Category:Rocket engines by propellant]]"}]}}}}
