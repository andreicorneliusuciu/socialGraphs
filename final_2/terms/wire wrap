Electronic components mounted on an insulating board are interconnected by lengths of insulated wire run between their  terminals, with the connections made by wrapping several turns around a component lead or a socket pin.\n\nWires can be wrapped by hand or by machine, and can be hand-modified afterwards. It was popular for large-scale manufacturing in the 60s and early 70s, and continues {{when?|date=September 2016}} to be used for short runs and [[prototype]]s. The method eliminates the design and fabrication of a [[printed circuit board]]. Wire wrapping is unusual among other prototyping technologies since it allows for complex assemblies to be produced by automated equipment, but then easily repaired or modified by hand.\n\nWire wrap construction can produce assemblies which are more reliable than printed circuits: connections are less prone to fail due to vibration or physical stresses on the base board, and the lack of [[solder]] precludes [[Soldering#Electronic components (PCBs)|soldering]] faults such as corrosion, cold joints and dry joints. The connections themselves are firmer and have lower electrical resistance due to [[cold welding]] of the wire to the terminal post at the corners.\n\nWire wrap was used for assembly of high frequency prototypes and small production runs, including gigahertz microwave circuits and super computers. It is unique among automated prototyping techniques in that wire lengths can be exactly controlled, and twisted pairs or magnetically shielded twisted quads can be routed together.\n\nWire wrap construction became popular around 1960 in circuit board manufacturing, and use has now sharply declined. [[Surface-mount technology]] has made the technique much less useful than in previous decades. Solder-less [[breadboard]]s and the decreasing cost of professionally made PCBs have nearly eliminated this technology.\n\n== Overview ==\n{{\nmultiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 300\n| image1    = Manual wire wrap tool and wire wrap wire in various colours.jpg\n| caption1  = Manual wire wrapping/stripping tool\n| image2    = MechanicalWrapGun.png\n| caption2  = Mechanical wire wrap tool\n| image3    = WrapGun.png\n| caption3  = Electrical wire wrap tool\n}}\nA correctly made wire-wrap connection for 30 or 28 [[AWG]] wire is seven turns (fewer for larger wire) of bare wire with half to one and a half turns of insulated wire at the bottom for strain relief.<ref name=\"NASA Workmanship standards for Discrete Wiring\">{{Citation| url = http://workmanship.nasa.gov/lib/insp/2%20books/links/sections/301_Discrete%20Wiring.html| publisher = NASA| place = USA| title = Workmanship| contribution = Standards for Discrete Wiring| date = 2000-03-31| accessdate = 2011-08-21}}</ref><ref name=\"MIL-STD-1130B\">{{cite web|author=Department of Defense|title=Military Standard: Connections, Electrical, Solderless Wrapped|date=1978-12-12|url=http://everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-1100-1299/MIL-STD-1130B_22383/|format=pdf|df=dmy|access-date=2016-11-04|at=sec. 5.3.2}}</ref>  The square hard-gold-plated post thus forms 28 redundant contacts.  The silver-plated wire coating cold-welds to the gold.  If corrosion occurs, it occurs on the outside of the wire, not on the gas-tight contact where oxygen cannot penetrate to form oxides.  A correctly designed wire-wrap tool applies up to twenty tons of force per square inch on each joint.\n\nThe electronic parts sometimes plug into [[Jack (connector)|sockets]]. The sockets are attached with [[cyanoacrylate]] (or [[silicone]] adhesive) to thin plates of glass-fiber-reinforced [[epoxy]] ([[fiberglass]]).\n\nThe sockets have square posts. The usual posts are {{convert|0.025|in|mm|abbr=on}} square, {{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=on|1}} high, and spaced at {{convert|0.1|in|mm|abbr=on|2}} intervals. Premium posts are hard-drawn [[beryllium copper]] alloy plated with a {{convert|0.000025|in|nm|abbr=on}} of gold to prevent corrosion. Less-expensive posts are [[bronze]] with [[tin]] plating.\n\n[[File:Wire wrap tool.jpg|thumb|left|The two holes at the end of a manual wire wrap tool. The wire goes in the one near the edge, and the post is inserted into the hole in the center]]\n\n30 [[American wire gauge|gauge]] (~0.0509mm) [[silver]]-plated soft [[copper]] wire is insulated with a [[fluorocarbon]] that does not emit dangerous gases when heated. The most common insulation is \"[[Kynar]]\".\n\nThe 30 [[American wire gauge|AWG]] Kynar wire is cut into standard lengths, then one inch of insulation is removed on each end.\n\nA  \"wire wrap tool\" has two holes. The wire and {{convert|1/4|in|mm|abbr=on}} of insulated wire are placed in a hole near the edge of the tool. The hole in the center of the tool is placed over the post.\n\nThe tool is rapidly twisted. The result is that 1.5 to 2 turns of insulated wire are wrapped around the post, and above that, 7 to 9 turns of bare wire are wrapped around the post. The post has room for three such connections, although usually only one or two are needed. This permits manual wire-wrapping to be used for repairs.\n\nThe turn and a half of insulated wire helps prevent wire fatigue where it meets the post.\n\nAbove the turn of insulated wire, the bare wire wraps around the post. The corners of the post bite in with pressures of tons per square inch. This forces all the gases out of the area between the wire's silver plate and the post's gold or tin corners. Further, with 28 such connections (seven turns on a four-cornered post), a very reliable connection exists between the wire and the post. Furthermore, the corners of the posts are quite \"sharp\": they have a quite-small radius of curvature.\n\nThere are three ways of placing wires on a board.\n\nIn professionally built wire-wrap boards, long wires are placed first so that shorter wires mechanically secure the long wires. Also, to make an assembly more repairable, wires are applied in layers. The ends of each wire are always at the same height on the post, so that at most three wires need to be replaced to replace a wire. Also, to make the layers easier to see, they are made with different colors of insulation. In space-rated or airworthy wire-wrap assemblies, the wires are boxed, and may be conformally coated with wax to reduce vibration.  Epoxy is never used for the coating because it makes an assembly unrepairable.\n\n== Application considerations==\n[[File:Computerplatine Wire-wrap backplane detail Z80 Doppel-Europa-Format 1977.jpg|thumb|Wrapped [[Z80]] computer backplane 1977]]\nWire-wrap works well with digital circuits with few discrete components, but is less convenient for analog systems with many discrete resistors, capacitors or other components (such elements can be soldered to a header and plugged into a wire wrap socket).<ref>Horowitz and Hill, \"The Art of Electronics 3rd Edition\", pp. 828-830</ref> The sockets are an additional cost compared to directly inserting integrated circuits into a printed circuit board, and add size and mass to a system. Multiple strands of wire may introduce cross-talk between circuits, of little consequence for digital circuits but a limitation for analog systems. The interconnected wires can radiate electromagnetic interference and have less predictable impedance than a printed circuit board. Wire-wrap construction cannot provide the ground planes and power distribution planes possible with multilayer printed circuit boards, increasing the possibility of noise.<ref>Horowitz and Hill \"the Art of Electronics 3rd Edition\", p. 816</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Western Union splice.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Examples of manually wrapped [[Western Union splice]]s]]\n[[File:IBM 1401 backplane.agr.jpg|thumb|Wire wrapped backplane of an [[IBM 1401]] computer, introduced in 1959]]\nWire wrapping comes from the tradition of [[rope splicing]]. Early wire wrapping was performed manually; a slow and careful process. Wire wrapping was used for splices and for finishing cable ends in suspension bridge wires and other wire rope rigging, usually with a smaller diameter wire wrapped around a larger wire or bundle of wires. Such techniques were purely mechanical, to add strength or prevent fraying.\n\nIn the late 19th century, [[telegraph]] linemen developed methods of making a wire splice that would be strong mechanically and also carry electricity. The [[Western Union splice]] was the strongest of such wire-wrapped splices. The wraps could be coated in [[solder]] for even greater strength and to prevent oxidation between the wires.<ref>{{cite book| last=Sharp| first=John MacLaren|title=Practical Electric Wiring|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i41RAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA13| year=1916|publisher=D. Appleton and Company|location=New York and London|pages=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\nManually wrapped wires were common in early 20th century [[Point-to-point construction|point-to-point electronic construction]] methods in which a strong connection was needed to hold the components in place. Wires were wrapped by hand around binding posts or spade lugs and then soldered.\n\nModern wire wrapping technology was developed after WWII at [[Bell Laboratories]] as a means of making electrical connections in a new relay being designed for use in the Bell Telephone system. A design team headed by [[Arthur C. Keller]] developed the \u201cKeller Wrap Gun\u201d, and the entire wrap system was passed over to [[Western Electric]] for execution. After a \u201cmake or buy\u201d committee at Western Electric decided to have the hand tool manufactured by an outside vendor, Western Electric sent the tool contract out for bids. Keller Tool of Grand Haven, Michigan, a supplier of rotary hand tools to Western Electric, won the contract and made several design changes to make the tool easier to manufacture and to use. Keller began manufacturing the tools in 1953, and subsequently obtained a license from Western Electric allowing sale of the technology on the open market. The tool was marketed under its original name \u2013 since the name of the manufacturer was coincidentally the same as the name of the inventor.\n\n[[IBM]]'s first transistorized computers, introduced the late 1950s, were built with the [[IBM Standard Modular System]] that used wire-wrapped backplanes.\n\n== Manual wire wrap ==\n[[File:Crossbar-banjo1-hy.jpg|thumb|Typical wire wrap construction of [[Bell System]] telephone [[crossbar switch]]. Some types of connection were soldered.]]\n\nA manual wire wrap tool resembles a small pen. It is convenient for minor repairs. Wire wrap is one of the most repairable systems for assembling electronics. Posts can be rewrapped up to ten times without appreciable wear, provided that new wire is used each time. Slightly larger jobs are done with a manual \"wire wrap gun\" having a geared and spring-loaded squeeze grip to spin the bit rapidly.\n\nSuch tools were used in large numbers in American [[telephone exchange]]s in the last third of the 20th century, usually with a bigger bit to handle 22 or 24 AWG wire rather than the smaller 28 or 30 AWG used in circuit boards and backplanes. The larger posts can be rewrapped hundreds of times. They persisted into the 21st century in [[distribution frame]]s where [[insulation-displacement connector]]s had not taken over entirely.  Larger, hand held, high speed electric wrap guns replaced soldering in the late 1960s for permanent wiring, when installing exchange equipment. In the middle 1980s they were gradually replaced by connectorized cables.\n\nThe [[Apollo Guidance Computer]] with its short production run and stringent reliability requirement was one of the early applications of wire wrap to computer assembly.\n\n== Semiautomated wire wrap ==\n[[File:KL10-backplane-tp.jpg|thumb|[[PDP-10|KL10]] backplane, an example of semiautomated wire wrap with twisted pairs]]\n\nSemiautomated powered wire-wrap systems place \"wire-wrap guns\" on arms moved in two dimensions by computer-controlled motors. The guns are manually pulled down, and the trigger pressed to make a wrap. The wires are inserted into the gun manually. This system allows the operator to place wires without concern about whether they are on the correct pin, since the computer places the gun correctly.\n\nSemi-automated wire wrapping is unique among prototyping systems because it can place [[twisted pair]]s, and twisted magnetically shielded quads, permitting the assembly of complex radar and high speed digital circuits.\n\n== Automated wire wrapping ==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2011}}\n[[File:PDP-8I-backplane.jpg|thumb|[[PDP-8]]I backplane, an example of automated wire wrapping]]\n\nAutomated wire-wrap machines, as manufactured by the Gardner Denver Company in the 1960s and 1970s, were capable of automatically routing, cutting, stripping and wrapping wires onto an electronic \"backplane\" or \"circuit board\". The machines were driven by wiring instructions encoded onto [[punched card]]s, [[Mylar]] punched hole tape, and early micro computers.\n\nThe earliest machines (14FB and 14FG models, for example) were initially configured as \"horizontal\", which meant that the wire wrap board was placed upside down (pins up) onto a horizontal tooling plate, which was then rolled into the machine and locked onto a rotating (TRP table rotational position of four positions) and shifting (PLP = pallet longitudinal position of 11 positions) pallet assembly. These machines included very large hydraulic units for powering the servos that drove the ball screw mounted \"A\" and \"B\" drive carriages, a {{convert|6|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}} tall electronics cabinet loaded with hundreds of IBM control relays, many dozens of solenoids for controlling the various pneumatic mechanical subsystems, and an IBM 029 card reader for positioning instructions. The automatic wire wrap machines themselves were quite large, {{convert|6|ft|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|8|ft|abbr=on}} square. Servicing the machines was extremely complex, and often meant climbing inside them just to work on them. This could be quite dangerous if safety interlocks were not maintained properly.\n\nLater, somewhat smaller machines were \"vertical\" (14FV) which meant the boards were placed onto a tooling plate with pins facing the machine operator. Gone were the hydraulic units, in favor of direct drive motors to rotate the [[ball screw]]s, with [[rotary encoder]]s to provide positioning feedback. This generally provided better visibility of the product for the operator, although maximum wrap area was significantly less than the horizontal machines. Top speeds on horizontal machines were generally around 500-600 wires per hour, while the vertical machines could reach rates as high as 1200 per hour, depending on board quality and wiring configurations.\n\n== Design automation ==\nIn wire-wrapping, [[electronic design automation]] can design the board, and optimize the order in which wires are placed.\n\nThe first stage was that a schematic was encoded into a netlist. This step is now done automatically by EDA programs that perform \"schematic capture\". A netlist is conceptually a list of pins, with each pin having an associated signal name.\n\nThe next step was to encode the pin positions of each device. The easy way to do this is to encode lettered rows and numbered columns where the devices should go. The computer then assigns pin 1 of each device in the bill of materials to an intersection, and renames the devices in the bill of materials by their row and column.\n\nThe computer would then \"explode\" the device list into a complete pin list for the board by using templates for each type of device. A template is map of a device's pins. It can be encoded once, and then shared by all devices of that type.\n\nSome systems optimized the design by experimentally swapping the positions of parts and [[logic gate]]s to reduce the wire length.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} After each movement, the associated pins in the netlist would be renamed. Some systems {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} could also automatically discover power pins in the devices, and generate wires to the nearest power pins.\n\nThe computer program then merges the netlist (sorted by pin name) with the pin list (sorted by pin name), transferring the physical coordinates of the pin list to the netlist. The netlist is then resorted, by net name.\n\nThe programs then try to reorder each net in the signal-pin list to \"route\" each signal in the shortest way. The routing problem is equivalent to the [[travelling salesman problem]], which is [[NP complete]], and therefore not amenable to a perfect solution on a reasonable time scale. One practical routing algorithm is to pick the pin farthest from the center of the board, then use a greedy algorithm to select the next-nearest pin with the same signal name.\n\nOnce routed, each pair of nodes in a net becomes a wire, in a \"wire list\".\nThe computer then reads incidental information (wire color, order in the net, length of the wire, etc.) in the netlist and interprets it to renumber the wire list to optimize the ordering and direction of wires during production. The wire list is then resorted by the wire numbers.\n\nFor example, wires are always \"top and bottomed\". That is, wires alternate between high and low as they connect a series of pins. This lets a repair or modification occur with the removal of at most three wires.\n\nLong wires are usually placed first within a level, so that shorter wires will hold longer wires down. This reduces vibration of the longer wires, making the board more rugged in a vibrating environment such as a vehicle.\n\nPlacing all the wires of a certain size makes it easier for a manual or semiautomated wire-wrapping machine to use precut wire. This especially speeds up manual wrapping.\n\nWires of different colors can also be placed together. Most wires are blue. Power and ground wires are often made with red and black. Clock wires (or other wires needing special routing) are often made yellow or white. Twisted pairs are usually black and white.\n\nAnother optimization is that within each size and color of wire, the computer selects the next wire so that the wrap head moves to the nearest pin. This can save up to 40% of the wrap time, almost getting two wire-wrap machines for the price of one. It also reduces wear on the wire-wrap machines.\n\nFinally, the direction of placing a wire can be optimized for [[right-handed]] wire-wrap people, so that wires are placed from right to left. In a semi-automated wire-wrap system, this means that the wrap head moves away from the user's hand when placing a wire. The user can then use their strong hand and eye to route the wire.\n\nLastly, the sorted, optimized wire list is then printed out for use by machine operators, and turned into a tape or card deck for the machine. Machine-readable copies of this valuable production data are often archived at the same time.\n\n==Telecommunications==\nIn [[telecommunications]] wire wrap is in common high volume use in modern [[communications network]]s for cross connects of copper wiring. For example, most phone lines from the [[outside plant]] go to wire wrap panels in a [[Telephone exchange|central office]], whether used for [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]], [[DSL]] or [[T-carrier|T1]] lines. Typically at a [[main distribution frame]] Internal Cross Facilities Assignments and External Cross Facilities Assignments, are connected together via jumpers that are wire wrapped. Wire wrap is popular in telecommunications since it is one of the most secure ways to attach wires, and provides excellent and consistent data layer contact. Wirewrap panels are rated for high quality data services, including [[Category 5 cable|Cat 5]] grade wiring.  The principal competitor in this application is [[punch block]]s, which are quicker but less secure.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Breadboard]]\n* [[Stripboard]]\n* [[Wire sculpture]]\n* [[Wiring pencil]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Wire wrapping}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n[[Category:Electronics substrates]]\n[[Category:Electronics manufacturing]]\n[[Category:Wire]]"}]}}}}
