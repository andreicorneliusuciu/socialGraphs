The benefit of CAD systems over manual drafting are the capabilities one often takes for granted from computer systems today;  automated generation of [[Bill of Material]], auto layout in [[integrated circuits]], interference checking, and many others. Eventually CAD provided the designer with the ability to perform engineering calculations. During this transition, calculations were still performed either by hand or by those individuals who could run computer programs. CAD was a revolutionary change in the engineering industry, where draftsmen, designers and engineering roles begin to merge. It did not eliminate departments, as much as it merged departments and empowered draftsman, designers and engineers. CAD is just another example of the pervasive effect computers were beginning to have on industry.\nCurrent computer-aided design software packages range from 2D [[vector graphics|vector]]-based drafting systems to 3D [[Solid modeling|solid]] and [[Freeform surface modelling|surface]] modelers. Modern CAD packages can also frequently allow rotations in three dimensions, allowing viewing of a designed object from any desired angle, even from the inside looking out. Some CAD software is capable of dynamic mathematical modeling, in which case it may be marketed as CAD.\n\nCAD technology is used in the design of tools and machinery and in the drafting and design of all types of buildings, from small residential types (houses) to the largest commercial and industrial structures (hospitals and factories).<ref>{{cite web\n | title = 3D Model-Based Design: Setting the Definitions Straight\n | author = Jennifer Herron\n | publisher = MCADCafe\n | year = 2010\n | url = http://www10.mcadcafe.com/nbc/articles/2/867959/3D-Model-Based-Design-Setting-Definitions-Straight\n}}</ref>\n\nCAD is mainly used for detailed engineering of 3D models and/or 2D drawings of physical components, but it is also used throughout the engineering process from conceptual design and layout of products, through strength and dynamic analysis of assemblies to definition of manufacturing methods of components. It can also be used to design objects. Furthermore, many CAD applications now offer advanced rendering and animation capabilities so engineers can better visualize their product designs. [[4D BIM]] is a type of virtual construction engineering simulation incorporating time or schedule related information for project management.\n\nCAD has become an especially important technology within the scope of [[CAx|computer-aided technologies]], with benefits such as lower product development costs and a greatly shortened design cycle. CAD enables designers to layout and develop work on screen, print it out and save it for future editing, saving time on their drawings.\n\n==Uses==\nComputer-aided design is one of the many tools used by engineers and designers and is used in many ways depending on the profession of the user and the type of software in question.\n\nCAD is one part of the whole Digital Product Development (DPD) activity within the [[Product Lifecycle Management]] (PLM) processes, and as such is used together with other tools, which are either integrated modules or stand-alone products, such as:\n\n*[[Computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) and [[Finite element analysis]] (FEA)\n*[[Computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) including instructions to [[Computer Numerical Control]] (CNC) machines\n*[[Photorealistic rendering]] and Motion Simulation.\n*Document management and [[revision control]] using [[Product Data Management]] (PDM).\n\nCAD is also used for the accurate creation of photo simulations that are often required in the preparation of Environmental Impact Reports, in which computer-aided designs of intended buildings are superimposed into photographs of existing environments to represent what that locale will be like, where the proposed facilities are allowed to be built. Potential blockage of view corridors and shadow studies are also frequently analyzed through the use of CAD.\n\nCAD has been proven to be useful to engineers as well. Using four properties which are history, features, parameterization, and high level constraints. The construction history can be used to look back into the model's personal features and work on the single area rather than the whole model. Parameters and constraints can be used to determine the size, shape, and other properties of the different modeling elements. The features in the CAD system can be used for the variety of tools for measurement such as tensile strength, yield strength, electrical or electro-magnetic properties. Also its stress, strain, [[Timing closure|timing]] or how the element gets affected in certain temperatures, etc.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:CAD Modeling.gif|thumb|A simple procedure]]\n{{see also|Comparison of computer-aided design editors}}\nThere are several different types of CAD,<ref>{{cite web\n | title = 3D Feature-based, Parametric Solid Modeling|work=engineershandbook.com\n | url = http://engineershandbook.com/Software/cad2.htm#3dp\n}}</ref> each requiring the operator to think differently about how to use them and design their virtual components in a different manner for each.\n\nThere are many producers of the lower-end 2D systems, including a number of free and open source programs. These provide an approach to the drawing process without all the fuss over scale and placement on the drawing sheet that accompanied hand drafting, since these can be adjusted as required during the creation of the final draft.\n\n''3D [[Wire-frame model|wireframe]]'' is basically an extension of 2D drafting (not often used today). Each line has to be manually inserted into the drawing. The final product has no mass properties associated with it and cannot have features directly added to it, such as holes. The operator approaches these in a similar fashion to the 2D systems, although many 3D systems allow using the wireframe model to make the final engineering drawing views.\n\n''3D \"dumb\" solids'' are created in a way analogous to manipulations of real world objects (not often used today). Basic three-dimensional geometric forms (prisms, cylinders, spheres, and so on) have solid volumes added or subtracted from them, as if assembling or cutting real-world objects. Two-dimensional projected views can easily be generated from the models. Basic 3D solids don't usually include tools to easily allow motion of components, set limits to their motion, or identify interference between components.\n\nThere are two types of ''[[solid modeling|3D Solid Modeling]]''\n\n# ''Parametric modeling'' allows the operator to use what is referred to as \"design intent\". The objects and features created are modifiable. Any future modifications can be made by changing how the original part was created. If a feature was intended to be located from the center of the part, the operator should locate it from the center of the model. The feature could be located using any geometric object already available in the part, but this random placement would defeat the design intent. If the operator designs the part as it functions the parametric modeler is able to make changes to the part while maintaining geometric and functional relationships.\n# ''[[Explicit modeling|Direct or Explicit modeling]]'' provide the ability to edit geometry without a history tree. With direct modeling once a sketch is used to create geometry the sketch is incorporated into the new geometry and the designer just modifies the geometry without needing the original sketch. As with parametric modeling, [[direct modeling]] has the ability to include relationships between selected geometry (e.g., tangency, concentricity).\n\nTop end systems offer the capabilities to incorporate more organic, aesthetics and ergonomic features into designs. [[Freeform surface modeling]] is often combined with solids to allow the designer to create products that fit the human form and visual requirements as well as they interface with the machine.\n\n==Technology==\n[[File:cad mouse 1.svg|right|thumb|A CAD model of a [[Mouse (computing)|computer mouse]].]]\n\nOriginally software for Computer-Aided Design systems was developed with computer languages such as [[Fortran]], [[ALGOL]] but with the advancement of [[object-oriented programming]] methods this has radically changed. Typical modern [[parametric feature based modeler]] and [[freeform surface]] systems are built around a number of key [[C (programming language)|C]] modules with their own [[application programming interface|API]]s. A CAD system can be seen as built up from the interaction of a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) with [[NURBS]] geometry and/or [[boundary representation]] (B-rep) data via a [[geometric modeling kernel]]. A geometry constraint engine may also be employed to manage the associative relationships between geometry, such as wireframe geometry in a sketch or components in an assembly.\n\nUnexpected capabilities of these associative relationships have led to a new form of [[prototyping]] called [[digital prototyping]]. In contrast to physical prototypes, which entail manufacturing time in the design. That said, CAD models can be generated by a computer after the physical prototype has been scanned using an [[industrial CT scanning]] machine. Depending on the nature of the business, digital or physical prototypes can be initially chosen according to specific needs.\n\nToday, CAD systems exist for all the major platforms ([[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], [[UNIX]] and [[Mac OS X]]); some packages even support multiple platforms.\n\nRight now, no special hardware is required for most CAD software. However, some CAD systems can do graphically and computationally intensive tasks, so a modern [[graphics card]], high speed (and possibly multiple) [[Central processing unit|CPU]]s and large amounts of [[Random-access memory|RAM]] may be recommended.\n\nThe human-machine interface is generally via a [[computer mouse]] but can also be via a pen and digitizing [[graphics tablet]]. Manipulation of the view of the model on the screen is also sometimes done with the use of a [[3Dconnexion|Spacemouse/SpaceBall]]. Some systems also support stereoscopic glasses for [[Scientific visualization|viewing the 3D model]].Technologies which in the past were limited to larger installations or specialist applications have become available to a wide group of users.These include the [[Cave automatic virtual environment|CAVE]] or [[Virtual reality|HMD`s]] and interactive [[Leap Motion|devices]] like motion-sensing [[Kinect|technology]]\n\n==Software==\nCAD software enables engineers and architects to design, inspect and manage engineering projects within an integrated [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) on a [[personal computer]] system. Most applications support [[solid modeling]] with [[boundary representation]] (B-Rep) and [[NURBS]] geometry, and enable the same to be published in a variety of formats. A [[geometric modeling kernel]] is a software component that provides solid modeling and surface modeling features to CAD applications.\n\nBased on market statistics, [[commercial software]] from Autodesk, Dassault Systems, Siemens PLM Software and PTC dominate the CAD industry.<ref>[http://caewatch.com/the-big-6-in-cadcaeplm-software-industry-2011/ The Big 6 in CAD/CAE/PLM software industry (2011)], CAEWatch, September 12, 2011</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.softwaretop100.org/global-software-top-100-edition-2011|title=GLOBAL SOFTWARE TOP 100 - EDITION 2011|publisher=Software Top 100|date=2011-08-23|first=Michel|last=van Kooten}}</ref> The following is a list of major CAD applications, grouped by usage statistics.<ref name=\"bm\">[http://www.beyondmech.com/pro-e/cad-topic-33.html List of mechanical CAD softwares], BeyondMech</ref>\n\n{{colbegin}}\n;Commercial\n* ASCON [[KOMPAS-3D]]\n* Autodesk [[AutoCAD]]\n* Autodesk [[Autodesk Inventor|Inventor]]\n* Dassault [[CATIA]]\n* Dassault [[SolidWorks]]\n* Kubotek [[KeyCreator]]\n* Siemens [[Siemens NX|NX]]\n* Siemens [[Solid Edge]]\n* PTC [[PTC Creo|Pro/ENGINEER]] (now renamed Creo)\n* [[TurboCAD]]\n* [[IRONCAD|IronCAD]]\n* [[MEDUSA]]\n* [[ProgeCAD]]\n* [[SpaceClaim]]\n* [[Rhinoceros 3D]]\n* [[VariCAD]]\n* [[VectorWorks]]\n* [[Cobalt (CAD program)|Cobalt]]\n* RoutCad [[RoutCad]]\n\n;Freeware and open source\n* [[123D]]\n* [[LibreCAD]]\n* [[FreeCAD]]\n* [[BRL-CAD]]\n* [[OpenSCAD]]\n* [[NanoCAD]]\n* [[QCad]]\n\n;CAD Kernels\n* [[Parasolid]] by Siemens\n* [[ACIS]] by Spatial\n* [[ShapeManager]] by Autodesk\n* [[Open CASCADE]]\n* [[C3D]] by C3D Labs\n* K3 by Center GeoS\n{{colend}}\n\n== History==\nDesigners have long used computers for their calculations.<ref>{{cite web\n | title = History of CAD/CAM\n | publisher = CADAZZ\n | year = 2004\n | url = http://www.cadazz.com/cad-software-history.htm\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | last = Pillers\n | first = Michelle\n | title = MCAD Renaissance of the 90's\n | publisher = Cadence Magazine\n | date = March 1998\n | url = http://www.edeinc.com/Cadence/98Mar/Article98Mar.html\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070422170613/http://www.edeinc.com/Cadence/98Mar/Article98Mar.html\n| archivedate = 2007-04-22\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | last = Bozdoc\n | first = Marian\n | title = The History of CAD\n | publisher = iMB|year=2003\n | url = http://mbinfo.mbdesign.net/CAD-History.htm\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | last = Carlson\n | first = Wayne\n | title = A Critical History of Computer Graphics and Animation\n | publisher = Ohio State University\n | year = 2003\n | url = http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/lesson10.html\n}}</ref> [[Claude Shannon|Digital computers]] were used in power system analysis or optimization as early as proto-\"[[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]]\" in [[Network analyzer (AC power)|1949]].

[http://www.cadhistory.net/toc.htm The Engineering Design Revolution].</ref> work before SKETCHPAD sitting on evolving math libraries emerged from MIT`s labs. Additional developments were carried out in the 1960s within the aircraft, automotive, industrial control and electronics industries in the area of 3D surface construction, NC programming and design analysis, most of it independent of one another and often not publicly published until much later. Some of the mathematical description work on curves was developed in the early 1940s by Robert Issac Newton from Pawtucket, Rhode Island. [[Robert A. Heinlein]] in his 1957 novel ''The Door into Summer'' suggested the possibility of a robotic ''Drafting Dan''. However, probably the most important work on polynomial curves and sculptured surface was done by [[Pierre B\u00e9zier]], [[Paul de Casteljau]] ([[Citroen]]), [[Steven Anson Coons]] ([[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]), James Ferguson ([[Boeing]]), [[Carl de Boor]] ([[General Motors|GM]]), Birkhoff (GM) and Garibedian (GM) in the 1960s and W. Gordon (GM) and R. Riesenfeld in the 1970s.\n\nThe invention of the 3D CAD/CAM is attributed to a French engineer, [[Pierre Bezier]] ([[Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech]], Renault). After his mathematical work concerning surfaces, he developed [[UNISURF]], between 1966 and 1968, to ease the design of parts and tools for the automotive industry. Then, UNISURF became the working base for the following generations of CAD software.\n\nIt is argued that a turning point was the development of the [[Sketchpad|SKETCHPAD]] system at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]<ref>Yares, Evan (February 13, 2013) [http://www.designworldonline.com/50-years-of-cad/#_ 50 Years of CAD].

The distinctive feature of SKETCHPAD was that it allowed the designer to interact with his computer graphically: the design can be fed into the computer by drawing on a [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] [[Computer display|monitor]] with a [[light pen]]. Effectively, it was a prototype of [[graphical user interface]], an indispensable feature of modern CAD. Sutherland presented his paper Sketchpad: A Man-Machine Graphical Communication System in 1963 at a [[Joint Computer Conference]] having worked on it as his PhD thesis paper for a few years. Quoting,\"For drawings where motion of the drawing, or analysis of a drawn problem is of value to the user, Sketchpad excels. For highly repetitive drawings or drawings where accuracy is required, Sketchpad is sufficiently faster than conventional techniques to be worthwhile. For drawings which merely communicate with shops, it is probably better to use conventional paper and pencil.\" Over time efforts would be directed toward the goal of having the [[Autodesk 123D|designers drawings communicate]] not just with shops but with the [[STEP-NC|shop tool]] itself. This goal would be a long time arriving.\n\nThe first commercial applications of CAD were in large companies in the automotive and aerospace industries, as well as in electronics. Only large corporations could afford the computers capable of performing the calculations. Notable company projects were, a joint project of [[General Motors Corporation|GM]] (Dr. Patrick J.Hanratty) and [[IBM]] ([http://www.siggraph.org/publications/newsletter/v32n1/columns/machover.html Sam Matsa], Doug Ross`s [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] APT research assistant) to develop a prototype system for design engineers [[DAC-1]] (Design Augmented by Computer) 1964; [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] projects; [[Nokia Bell Labs|Bell]] GRAPHIC 1 and [[Renault]].\n\nOne of the most influential events in the development of CAD was the founding of MCS (Manufacturing and Consulting Services Inc.) in 1971 by Dr. P. J. Hanratty,<ref>{{cite web\n | title = MCS Founder: Patrick J. Hanratty, Ph.D., President and Founder\n | url = http://mcsaz.com/about/founder.htm| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050209155207/http://mcsaz.com/about/founder.htm| archivedate = 2005-02-09|work=mcsaz.com\n}}</ref> who wrote the system ADAM (Automated Drafting And Machining) but more importantly supplied code to companies such as [[McDonnell Douglas]] ([[Unigraphics]]), [[Computervision]] ([[CADDS]]), [[Calma]], [[Gerber Scientific|Gerber]], [[Auto-Trol Technology|Autotrol]] and [[Control Data Corporation|Control Data]].\n\nAs computers became more affordable, the application areas have gradually expanded. The development of CAD software for personal desktop computers was the impetus for almost universal application in all areas of construction.\n\nOther key points in the 1960s and 1970s would be the foundation of CAD systems [[UGS Corp.|United Computing]], [[Intergraph]], [[IBM]], Intergraph IGDS in 1974 (which led to [[Bentley Systems]] [[MicroStation]] in 1984).\n\nCAD implementations have evolved dramatically since then. Initially, with 3D in the 1970s, it was typically limited to producing drawings similar to hand-drafted drawings. Advances in programming and computer hardware,<ref>Akeley, Kurt (1981) [http://diglib.eg.org/EG/DL/WS/EGGH/EGGH91/003-005.pdf Issues and Directions for Graphics Hardware Accelerators]. Eurographics Digital Laboratory, diglib.eg.org.</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/Computer1984_6 Computer Graphics (4/5/1984)]. archive.org</ref> notably solid modeling in the 1980s, have allowed more versatile applications of computers in design activities.\n\nKey products for 1981 were the solid modelling packages - [[Romulus (b-rep solid modeler)|Romulus]] (ShapeData) and Uni-Solid (Unigraphics) based on PADL-2 and the release of the surface modeler [[CATIA]] ([[Dassault Systemes]]). Autodesk was founded 1982 by John Walker, which led to the 2D system [[AutoCAD]]. The next milestone was the release of [[Pro/ENGINEER]] in 1987, which heralded greater usage of feature-based modeling methods and parametric linking of the parameters of features. Also of importance to the development of CAD was the development of the B-rep solid modeling kernels (engines for manipulating geometrically and topologically consistent 3D objects) [[Parasolid]] (ShapeData) and [[ACIS]] (Spatial Technology Inc.) at the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s, both inspired by the work of Ian Braid. This led to the release of mid-range packages such as [[SolidWorks]] and TriSpective (later known as [[Ironcad|IRONCAD]]) in 1995, [[Solid Edge]] (then [[Intergraph]]) in 1996 and [[Autodesk Inventor]] in 1999. An independent [[geometric modeling kernel]] has been evolving in Russia since the 1990s.<ref>{{cite journal \n  |last = Yares\n  |first = Evan\n  |title = Russian CAD\n  |url = http://www.designworld-digital.com/designworld/april_2013#pg61\n  |journal = Design World\n  |volume = 8\n  |issue = 4\n  |publisher = WTWH Media, LLC\n  |issn = 1941-7217\n  |date=April 2013}}</ref> Nikolay Golovanov joined [[ASCON |ASCON Company]] in 1994 from the [[KBM|Kolomna Engineering Design Bureau]] and began development of [[C3D]] \u2013 the geometric kernel of the Russian popular CAD system, KOMPAS-3D.<ref>{{cite book\n  |last = Golovanov\n  |first = Nikolay\n  |title = Geometric Modeling: The mathematics of shapes\n  |asin = 1497473195\n  |publisher = CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (December 24, 2014)\n  |page = Back cover  \n  |isbn = 978-1497473195\n  |date = December 24, 2014}}</ref> Nowadays, [[C3D]] (C3D Labs) is the most valued Russian CAD product in the category of \"components\", i.e. products designed for integration in the end-user CAD systems of Russian and global vendors.<ref>{{cite web\n  |last = Ershov\n  |first  = Alexey\n  |title = C3D Labs: \"By experience we are comparable with the leaders but we work faster!\"\n  |url = http://isicad.net/articles.php?article_num=16765\n  |publisher = LEDAS Ltd.\n  |accessdate = February 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[3D computer graphics software]]\n* [[3D modeling]]\n* [[3D printing]]\n* [[Additive Manufacturing File Format]]\n* [[CAD standards]]\n* [[Coarse space (numerical analysis)]]\n* [[Comparison of 3D computer graphics software]]\n* [[Comparison of computer-aided design editors]]\n* [[Comparison of Free EDA software]] (Electronic Design Automation)\n* [[Computer-aided industrial design]]\n* [[Digital architecture]]\n* [[Electronic design automation]]\n* [[Engineering optimization]]\n* [[Finite element method]]\n* [[Integrating functionality]]\n* [[ISO 128]]\n* [[ISO 10303]] STEP\n* [[Model based definition]]\n* [[Molecular design software]]\n* [[Open hardware]]\n* [[Rapid prototyping]]\n* [[Space mapping]]\n* [[Surrogate model]]\n* [[Virtual prototyping]] \n* [[Virtual reality]] \n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{wikiversity-inline|Computer-aided Geometric Design}}\n* {{wikiversity-inline|Computer-aided design}}\n* {{Commons category-inline}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n\n{{CAD software}}\n{{Building information modeling}}\n{{Design}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Portal bar|Computer-generated imagery}}\n\n[[Category:Free computer-aided design software| ]]\n[[Category:Computer-aided design| ]]\n[[Category:Design engineering]]"}]}}}}
