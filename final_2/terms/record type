The typefaces include a large number of special characters intended to replicate the various [[scribal abbreviation]]s and other unusual [[glyph]]s typically found in such manuscripts. They were used in the publication of [[archive|archival texts]] between 1774 and 1900.\n\n==History==\n\nRecord type was originally developed in the 1770s when plans were under way for the [[publication of Domesday Book]]. Early experiments in using special typefaces were not successful, but in 1773 the printer [[John Nichols (printer)|John Nichols]] designed a record type for an extract from Domesday to be included in [[John Hutchins (antiquary)|John Hutchins]]' ''History and Antiquities of the County of Dorset'' (published in 1774). He was so pleased with the result that he and the co-editor of Domesday, [[Abraham Farley]], persuaded the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] that the typeface should be adopted for the main project. It was consequently used in [[Publication of Domesday Book#Abraham Farley\u2019s edition (1783)|Farley\u2019s edition of Domesday Book]], published in 1783. Nichols regarded the design as among his greatest achievements, stating that \"on the correctness and beauty of this important Work, I am prepared to stake my typographical credit\".<ref>Condon and Hallam 1984, pp. 377\u20139.</ref> \n\nThe original Domesday type was destroyed in the fire at Nichols' office in 1808,<ref>Condon and Hallam 1984, p. 379n.</ref> but a modified form of record type was widely used during the first half of the 19th century in the publications of the [[Record Commission]]. It was subsequently used in the publications of the [[Pipe rolls#Publication|Pipe Roll Society]] from 1884 until 1900; and in 1890 in a single volume published by the [[Selden Society]] (despite the misgivings of the society's founder, [[Frederic William Maitland|F. W. Maitland]]).<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=William Paley |editor-last=Baildon |title=Select Civil Pleas: Volume 1, A.D. 1200\u20131203 |series=Selden Society |volume=3 |publisher=Selden Society |place=London |year=1890 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=D.

Hector has argued that the modest amount of rationalisation and standardisation required to set a manuscript in record type resulted in a \"half-way stage towards the interpretation of the abbreviations\" that remains a useful tool to assist the novice in medieval [[palaeography]].<ref>Hector 1966, p. 36.</ref>\n\nCharles Trice Martin's ''The Record Interpreter'' (first edition 1892; second edition 1910), which remains a standard handbook for the interpretation of English medieval manuscript texts, employs a version of record type to present abbreviated words.<ref>{{cite book |first=Charles |last=Trice Martin |title=The Record Interpreter: a collection of abbreviations, Latin words and names used in English historical manuscripts and records |edition=2nd |year=1910 |place=London |publisher=Stevens and Sons }}</ref>\n\nA continuing desire in the digital age to represent the special characters of medieval texts in typographical form is demonstrated by the establishment in 2001 of the [[Medieval Unicode Font Initiative]], which aims to coordinate the encoding and display of such characters.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite journal |first1=M.M. |last1=Condon |first2=E. |last2=Hallam |title=Government Printing of the Public Records in the Eighteenth Century |journal=Journal of the Society of Archivists |volume=7 |year=1984 |pages=348\u201388 |doi=10.1080/00379818409514252}}\n* {{cite book |first=P.D.A. |last=Harvey |title=Editing Historical Records |publisher=British Library |place=London |year=2001 |isbn=0-7123-4684-8 |pages=47\u201350 }}\n* {{cite book |first=L.C. |last=Hector |title=The Handwriting of English Documents |publisher=Edward Arnold |place=London |edition=2nd |year=1966 |pages=35\u20136 }}\n* {{Cite book| first=R.F. |last=Hunnisett |title=Editing Records for Publication |publisher=British Records Association |series=Archives and the User |volume=4 |year=1977 |location=London |ISBN=0-900222-05-0 |page=24 }}\n\n{{Typography terms}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Record Type}}\n[[Category:Typography]]\n[[Category:Academic publishing]]\n[[Category:Palaeography]]"}]}}}}
