A thermocouple produces a temperature-dependent [[voltage]] as a result of the [[thermoelectric effect]], and this voltage can be interpreted to measure temperature. Thermocouples are a widely used type of [[list of temperature sensors|temperature sensor]].<ref name=\"tcs_html\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.temperatures.com/tcs.html |work=Temperatures.com |title=Thermocouple temperature sensors |accessdate=2007-11-04}}</ref>\n\nCommercial thermocouples are inexpensive,<ref name=\"Ramsden2000\">{{cite journal |author=Ramsden, Ed |date=September 1, 2000 |title=Temperature measurement |journal=Sensors |url=http://www.sensorsmag.com/sensors/temperature/temperature-measurement-1030   |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref> interchangeable, are supplied with standard connectors, and can measure a wide range of temperatures. In contrast to most other methods of temperature measurement, thermocouples are self powered and require no external form of excitation. The main limitation with thermocouples is accuracy; system errors of less than one degree [[Celsius]] (\u00b0C) can be difficult to achieve.<ref name=\"tctable.html\">{{cite web |title=Technical Notes: Thermocouple Accuracy |work=IEC 584-2(1982)+A1(1989) |url=http://www.microlink.co.uk/tctable.html |accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref>\n\nThermocouples are widely used in science and industry; applications include temperature measurement for [[kiln]]s, [[gas turbine]] exhaust, [[diesel engine]]s, and other industrial processes.  Thermocouples are also used in homes, offices and businesses as the temperature sensors in thermostats, and also as flame sensors in [[Pilot light#Safety protection|safety devices]] for gas-powered major appliances.\n\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Principle of operation==\n\nIn 1821, the [[Germany|German]] physicist [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]] discovered that when different metals are joined at the ends and there is a temperature difference between the joints a magnetic field is observed. At the time Seebeck referred to this as thermo-magnetism, the magnetic field he observed was later shown to be due to thermo-electric current. In practical use the voltage generated at a single junction of two different types of wire is what is of interest as this can be used to measure temperature at very high and low temperatures.  The magnitude of the voltage depends on the types of wire used.  Generally, the voltage is in the microvolt range and care must be taken to obtain a usable measurement.  Although current flows very little, power can be generated by a single thermocouple junction.  Power generation using multiple thermocouples, as in a [[thermopile]], is common.\n\n[[File:Thermocouple circuit Ktype including voltmeter temperature.svg|frame|[[Thermocouple#Type K|K-type]] thermocouple ([[chromel]]\u2013[[alumel]]) in the standard thermocouple measurement configuration. The measured voltage <math>\\scriptstyle V</math> can be used to calculate temperature <math>\\scriptstyle T_\\mathrm{sense}</math>, provided that temperature <math>\\scriptstyle T_\\mathrm{ref}</math> is known.]]\n\nThe standard configuration for thermocouple usage is shown in the figure.\nBriefly, the desired temperature ''T''<sub>sense</sub> is obtained using three inputs\u2014the characteristic function ''E''(''T'') of the thermocouple, the measured voltage ''V'', and the reference junctions' temperature ''T''<sub>ref</sub>.\nThe solution to the equation ''E''(''T''<sub>sense</sub>) = ''V'' + ''E''(''T''<sub>ref</sub>) yields ''T''<sub>sense</sub>.\nThese details are often hidden from the user since the reference junction block (with ''T''<sub>ref</sub> thermometer), voltmeter, and equation solver are combined into a single product.\n\n===Physical principle: Seebeck effect===\n\n{{main article|Seebeck effect}}\n\nThe Seebeck effect refers to an [[electromotive force]] whenever there is a temperature gradient in a conductive material.\nUnder open-circuit conditions where there is no internal current flow, the [[gradient]] of voltage (<math>\\scriptstyle \\boldsymbol \\nabla V</math>) is directly proportional to the gradient in temperature (<math>\\scriptstyle \\boldsymbol \\nabla T</math>):\n:<math>\\boldsymbol \\nabla V  =  -S(T) \\boldsymbol \\nabla T,</math>\nwhere <math>S(T)</math> is a temperature-dependent [[material property]] known as the [[Seebeck coefficient]].\n\nThe standard measurement configuration shown in the figure, shows four temperature regions and thus four voltage contributions:\n# Change from <math>\\scriptstyle T_\\mathrm{meter}</math> to <math>\\scriptstyle T_\\mathrm{ref}</math>, in the lower copper wire.\n# Change from <math>\\scriptstyle T_\\mathrm{ref}</math> to <math>\\scriptstyle T_\\mathrm{sense}</math>, in the alumel wire.\n# Change from <math>\\scriptstyle T_\\mathrm{sense}</math> to <math>\\scriptstyle T_\\mathrm{ref}</math>, in the chromel wire.\n# Change from <math>\\scriptstyle T_\\mathrm{ref}</math> to <math>\\scriptstyle T_\\mathrm{meter}</math>, in the upper copper wire.\n\nThe first and fourth contributions cancel out exactly, because these regions involve the same temperature change and an identical material.\nAs a result, <math>\\scriptstyle T_\\mathrm{meter}</math> does not influence the measured voltage.\nThe second and third contributions do not cancel, as they involve different materials.\n\nThe measured voltage turns out to be\n:<math>V = \\int_{T_\\mathrm{ref}}^{T_\\mathrm{sense}} \\left( S_{+}(T) - S_{-}(T) \\right) \\, dT,</math>\nwhere <math>\\scriptstyle S_{+}</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle S_{-}</math> are the [[Seebeck coefficient]]s of the conductors attached to the positive and negative terminals of the voltmeter, respectively (chromel and alumel in the figure).\n\n===Characteristic function===\n\nAn integral does not need to be performed for every temperature measurement. Rather, the thermocouple's behaviour is captured by a '''characteristic function''' <math>\\scriptstyle E(T)</math>, which needs only to be consulted at two arguments:\n:<math>V = E(T_\\mathrm{sense}) - E(T_\\mathrm{ref}).</math>\nIn terms of the Seebeck coefficients, the characteristic function is defined by\n:<math>E(T) = \\int^T S_{+}(T') - S_{-}(T') dT' + \\mathrm{const} </math>\nThe [[constant of integration]] in this [[indefinite integral]] has no significance, but is conventionally chosen such that <math>\\scriptstyle E(0\\,{}^{\\circ}{\\rm C}) = 0</math>.\n\nThermocouple manufacturers and metrology standards organizations such as [[NIST]] provide tables of the function <math>\\scriptstyle E(T)</math> that have been measured and interpolated over a range of temperatures, for particular thermocouple types (see ''External links'' section for access to these tables).\n\n===Requirement for a reference junction===\n\n[[File:Cold Junction Compensation with Thermistor to measure the junction temperature..jpg|thumb|right|Reference junction block inside a Fluke CNX t3000 temperature meter. Two white wires connect to a [[thermistor]] (embedded in white thermal compound) to measure the reference junctions' temperature.]]\n\nTo obtain the desired measurement of <math>\\scriptstyle T_\\mathrm{sense}</math>, it is not sufficient to just measure <math>\\scriptstyle V</math>.\nThe temperature at the reference junctions <math>\\scriptstyle T_\\mathrm{ref}</math> must be already known.\nTwo strategies are often used here:\n* \"Ice bath\" method: The reference junction block is immersed in a semi-frozen bath of distilled water at atmospheric pressure. The precise temperature of the melting point [[phase transition]] acts as a natural [[thermostat]], fixing <math>\\scriptstyle T_\\mathrm{ref}</math> to 0&nbsp;\u00b0C. \n* Reference junction sensor (known as \"cold junction compensation\"): The reference junction block is allowed to vary in temperature but, the temperature is measured at this block using a separate temperature sensor. This secondary measurement is used to compensate for temperature variation at the junction block. The thermocouple junction is often exposed to extreme environments, while the reference junction is often mounted near the instrument's location.  [[Silicon bandgap temperature sensor|Semiconductor thermometer]] devices are often used in modern thermocouple instruments.</li>\n</ul>\nIn both cases the value <math>\\scriptstyle V + E(T_\\mathrm{ref})</math> is calculated, then the function <math>\\scriptstyle E(T)</math> is [[root-finding algorithm|searched]] for a matching value. The argument where this match occurs is the value of <math>\\scriptstyle T_\\mathrm{sense}</math>.\n* A less common strategy is to use a hot reference junction. Historically, this was commonly found in temperature-critical processing plants where large numbers, often in the hundreds, of thermocouples were installed. It permitted the wiring from the field to the instrumentation or control room to be done using copper cable. Temperature control of the hot reference was either by an electrically heated, precision RTD controlled system or occasionally by a bimetallic controlled steam heater, (in hazardous areas).\n\n==Practical concerns==\n\nThermocouples ideally should be very simple measurement devices, with each type being characterized by a precise <math>\\scriptstyle E(T)</math> curve, independent of any other details.\nIn reality, thermocouples are affected by issues such as alloy manufacturing uncertainties, aging effects, and circuit design mistakes/misunderstandings.\n\n===Circuit construction===\n\nThe most common error in thermocouple construction is a circuit extension with dissimilar metals such as copper wires.\nAs explained in the ''Principles...'' section above, it is crucial to know the temperature at this point of transition, as this point is the very definition of the reference junction. All further junctions are irrelevant past the point where the switch to copper is made.\nThe mistake is in making this junction without measuring its temperature, and then proceeding as if the reference junction is a different junction nearer the voltmeter; when the compensated voltage <math>\\scriptstyle V + E(T_\\mathrm{ref})</math> is calculated, this fake reference's temperature is used in place of the actual reference temperature.\nIf the desire is to make an extension without needing a thermometer at that location, then extension wire (see below) may be used; this allows the reference junction to be made closer to the voltmeter.\n\nJunctions should be made in a reliable manner, but there are many possible approaches to accomplish this.\nFor low temperatures, junctions can be brazed or soldered, however it may be difficult to find a suitable [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] and this may not be suitable at the sensing junction due to the low solder melting point.\nReference and extension junctions are therefore usually made with screw [[terminal block]]s.\nFor high temperatures, a common approach is a [[spot weld]] or [[crimp connection|crimp]] using a durable material.<ref name=\"wang\"/>\nA common myth regarding thermocouples is that junctions must be made cleanly without involving a third metal, to avoid unwanted added emfs.<ref>Pyromation, Inc. [http://www.pyromation.com/Downloads/Doc/Training_TC_Theory.pdf \"Thermocouple theory\"] (2009).</ref>\nThis may result from another common misunderstanding that the voltage is generated at the junction.<ref>Rowe, Martin (2013). [http://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4423409/Simple--but-misunderstood \"Thermocouples: Simple but misunderstood\"], EDN Network.</ref> In fact, the junctions should in principle have uniform internal temperature, therefore no voltage is generated at the junction. The voltage is generated in the thermal gradient, along the wire.\n\nA thermocouple produces small signals, often microvolts in magnitude. Precise measurements of this signal require an amplifier with low [[input offset voltage]] and with care taken to avoid thermal emfs from self-heating within the voltmeter itself. If the thermocouple wire has a high resistance for some reason (poor contact at junctions, or very thin wires used for fast thermal response), then the measuring instrument should have high [[input impedance]] to prevent an offset in the voltage measured. A useful feature in thermocouple instrumentation will simultaneously measure resistance and detect faulty connections in the wiring or at thermocouple junctions.\n\n===Metallurgical grades===\n\nWhile a thermocouple wire type is often described by its chemical composition, the actual aim is to produce a pair of wires that follow a standardized <math>\\scriptstyle E(T)</math> curve.\n\nImpurities affect each batch of metal differently, producing variable Seebeck coefficients.\nTo match the standard behaviour, thermocouple wire manufacturers will deliberately mix in additional impurities to \"dope\" the alloy, compensating for uncontrolled variations in source material.<ref name=wang>Wang, T. P. (1990) [http://www.dugantech.com/Product_Group-Temperature/Technical%20Articles/TE-Thermocouple%20Materials%20Paper.pdf \"Thermocouple Materials\"] in ''ASM Handbook'', Vol. 2. ISBN 978-0-87170-378-1</ref>\nAs a result, there are standard and specialized grades of thermocouple wire, depending on the level of precision demanded in the thermocouple behaviour.\nPrecision grades may only be available in matched pairs, where one wire is modified to compensate for deficiencies in the other wire.\n\nA special case of thermocouple wire is known as \"extension grade\", designed to carry the thermoelectric circuit over a longer distance.\nExtension wires follow the stated <math>\\scriptstyle E(T)</math> curve but for various reasons they are not designed to be used in extreme environments and so they cannot be used at the sensing junction in some applications.\nFor example, an extension wire may be in a different form, such as highly flexible with stranded construction and plastic insulation, or be part of a multi-wire cable for carrying many thermocouple circuits.\nWith expensive noble metal thermocouples, the extension wires may even be made of a completely different, cheaper material that mimics the standard type over a reduced temperature range.<ref name=\"wang\"/>\n\n===Aging of thermocouples===\n\nThermocouples are often used at high temperatures and in reactive furnace atmospheres. In this case, the practical lifetime is limited by thermocouple aging. The thermoelectric coefficients of the wires in a thermocouple that is used to measure very high temperatures may change with time, and the measurement voltage accordingly drops. The simple relationship between the temperature difference of the junctions and the measurement voltage is only correct if each wire is homogeneous (uniform in composition). As thermocouples age in a process, their conductors can lose homogeneity due to chemical and metallurgical changes caused by extreme or prolonged exposure to high temperatures. If the aged section of the thermocouple circuit is exposed to a temperature gradient, the measured voltage will differ, resulting in error.\n\nAged thermocouples are only partly modified, for example being unaffected in the parts outside the furnace. For this reason, aged thermocouples cannot be taken out of their installed location and recalibrated in a bath or test furnace to determine error. This also explains why error can sometimes be observed when an aged thermocouple is pulled partly out of a furnace\u2014as the sensor is pulled back, aged sections may see exposure to increased temperature gradients from hot to cold as the aged section now passes through the cooler refractory area, contributing significant error to the measurement. Likewise, an aged thermocouple that is pushed deeper into the furnace might sometimes provide a more accurate reading if being pushed further into the furnace causes the temperature gradient to occur only in a fresh section.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kerlin, T.W.  |author2=Johnson, M.P. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Practical Thermocouple Thermometry (2nd Ed.)|year=2012|publisher=ISA|location=Research Triangle Park|isbn=978-1-937560-27-0|pages=110\u2013112|url=http://www.isa.org/Template.cfm?Section=Books3&Template=/Ecommerce/ProductDisplay.cfm&ProductID=12178}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\nCertain combinations of alloys have become popular as industry standards. Selection of the combination is driven by cost, availability, convenience, melting point, chemical properties, stability, and output. Different types are best suited for different applications. They are usually selected on the basis of the temperature range and sensitivity needed. Thermocouples with low sensitivities (B, R, and S types) have correspondingly lower resolutions. Other selection criteria include the chemical [[inertness]] of the thermocouple material and whether it is [[magnetic]] or not. Standard thermocouple types are listed below with the positive [[electrode]] (assuming <math>T_\\text{h} > T_\\text{c}</math>) first, followed by the negative electrode.\n\n===Nickel-alloy thermocouples===\n[[File:Intermediate temperature thermocouples reference functions.svg|thumb|Characteristic functions for thermocouples that reach intermediate temperatures, as covered by nickel-alloy thermocouple types E, J, K, M, N, T.

Additionally, it is non-magnetic.\nWide range is \u221250&nbsp;\u00b0C to +740&nbsp;\u00b0C\nand narrow range is \u2212110&nbsp;\u00b0C to +140&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n====Type J====\nType J ([[iron]]\u2013[[constantan]]) has a more restricted range (\u221240&nbsp;\u00b0C to +750&nbsp;\u00b0C) than type K, but higher sensitivity of about 50&nbsp;\u00b5V/\u00b0C.<ref name=\"Ramsden2000\"/> The [[Curie point]] of the iron (770&nbsp;\u00b0C)<ref>Buschow, K.

Type K was specified at a time when [[metallurgy]] was less advanced than it is today, and consequently characteristics may vary considerably between samples. One of the constituent metals, [[nickel]], is magnetic; a characteristic of thermocouples made with magnetic material is that they undergo a deviation in output when the material reaches its [[Curie temperature|Curie point]], which occurs for type K thermocouples at around 185&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nThey operate very well in oxidizing atmospheres. If, however, a mostly reducing atmosphere (such as hydrogen with a small amount of oxygen) comes into contact with the wires, the chromium in the chromel alloy oxidizes. This reduces the emf output, and the thermocouple reads low. This phenomenon is known as ''green rot'', due to the color of the affected alloy. Although not always distinctively green, the chromel wire will develop a mottled silvery skin and become magnetic. An easy way to check for this problem is to see whether the two wires are magnetic (normally, chromel is non-magnetic).\n\nHydrogen in the atmosphere is the usual cause of green rot. At high temperatures, it can diffuse through solid metals or an intact metal thermowell. Even a sheath of magnesium oxide insulating the thermocouple will not keep the hydrogen out.<ref>http://www.transcat.com/calibration-resources/application-notes/thermocouples/</ref>\n\n====Type M====\nType M (82%Ni/18%[[molybdenum|Mo]]\u201399.2%Ni/0.8%[[cobalt|Co]], by weight) are used in vacuum furnaces for the same reasons as with type C (described below). Upper temperature is limited to 1400&nbsp;\u00b0C. It is less commonly used than other types.\n\n====Type N====\nType N ([[Nicrosil]]\u2013[[Nisil]]) thermocouples are suitable for use between \u2212270&nbsp;\u00b0C and +1300&nbsp;\u00b0C, owing to its stability and oxidation resistance. Sensitivity is about 39&nbsp;\u00b5V/\u00b0C at 900&nbsp;\u00b0C, slightly lower compared to type K.\n\nDesigned at the [[Defence Science and Technology Organisation]] (DSTO) of Australia, by Noel A. Burley, type-N thermocouples overcome the three principal characteristic types and causes of thermoelectric instability in the standard base-metal thermoelement materials:<ref>Burley, Noel A. [http://www.omega.com/temperature/Z/pdf/z041-044.pdf Nicrosil/Nisil Type N Thermocouples]. www.omega.com.</ref>\n#A gradual and generally cumulative drift in thermal EMF on long exposure at elevated temperatures. This is observed in all base-metal thermoelement materials and is mainly due to compositional changes caused by [[oxidation]], [[carburization]], or [[neutron irradiation]] that can produce [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] in [[nuclear reactor]] environments. In the case of type-K thermocouples, manganese and aluminium atoms from the KN (negative) wire migrate to the KP (positive) wire, resulting in a down-scale drift due to chemical contamination. This effect is cumulative and irreversible.\n#A short-term cyclic change in thermal EMF on heating in the temperature range about 250\u2013650&nbsp;\u00b0C, which occurs in thermocouples of types K, J, T, and E. This kind of EMF instability is associated with structural changes such as magnetic short-range order in the metallurgical composition.\n#A time-independent perturbation in thermal EMF in specific temperature ranges. This is due to composition-dependent magnetic transformations that perturb the thermal EMFs in type-K thermocouples in the range about 25\u2013225&nbsp;\u00b0C, and in type J above 730&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nThe Nicrosil and Nisil thermocouple alloys show greatly enhanced thermoelectric stability relative to the other standard base-metal thermocouple alloys because their compositions substantially reduce the thermoelectric instabilities described above. This is achieved primarily by increasing component solute concentrations (chromium and silicon) in a base of nickel above those required to cause a transition from internal to external modes of oxidation, and by selecting solutes (silicon and magnesium) that preferentially oxidize to form a diffusion-barrier, and hence oxidation-inhibiting films.<ref>[http://www.jms-se.com/catalog/TypeN_vs_TypeK_Thermocouple.pdf Type N Thermocouple Versus Type K Thermocouple in A Brick Manufacturing Facility]. jms-se.com.</ref>\n\n====Type T====\nType T ([[copper]]\u2013[[constantan]]) thermocouples are suited for measurements in the \u2212200 to 350&nbsp;\u00b0C range. Often used as a differential measurement, since only copper wire touches the probes. Since both conductors are non-magnetic, there is no [[Curie point]] and thus no abrupt change in characteristics. Type-T thermocouples have a sensitivity of about 43&nbsp;\u00b5V/\u00b0C. Note that copper has a much higher [[thermal conductivity]] than the alloys generally used in thermocouple constructions, and so it is necessary to exercise extra care with thermally anchoring type-T thermocouples.\n\n===Platinum/rhodium-alloy thermocouples===\n[[File:High temperature thermocouples reference functions.svg|thumb|Characteristic functions for high-temperature thermocouple types, showing Pt/Rh, W/Re, Pt/Mo, and Ir/Rh-alloy thermocouples.

These are among the most stable thermocouples, but have lower sensitivity than other types, approximately 10&nbsp;\u00b5V/\u00b0C. Type B, R, and S thermocouples are usually used only for high-temperature measurements due to their high cost and low sensitivity.\n\n====Type B====\nType B (70%Pt/30%Rh\u201394%Pt/6%Rh, by weight) thermocouples are suited for use at up to 1800&nbsp;\u00b0C. Type-B thermocouples produce the same output at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C and 42&nbsp;\u00b0C, limiting their use below about 50&nbsp;\u00b0C. The emf function has a minimum around 21&nbsp;\u00b0C, meaning that cold-junction compensation is easily performed, since the compensation voltage is essentially a constant for a reference at typical room temperatures.<ref name=\"capgo\">\n{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.capgo.com/Resources/Temperature/Thermocouple/Thermocouple.html\n |title      = Thermocouple Theory\n |date       =\n |website    =\n |publisher  = Capgo\n |accessdate = 17 December 2013\n}}\n</ref>\n\n====Type R====\nType R (87%Pt/13%Rh\u2013Pt, by weight) thermocouples are used up to 1600&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n====Type S====\nType S (90%Pt/10%Rh\u2013Pt, by weight) thermocouples, similar to type R, are used up to 1600&nbsp;\u00b0C.

It can be used for [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] applications (1.2\u2013300 K and even up to 600 K). Both the sensitivity and the temperature range depend on the iron concentration.

While the wires can survive and function at high temperatures, the plastic insulation will start to break down at 300&nbsp;\u00b0C.]]\n\nThe wires that make up the thermocouple must be [[Insulator (electricity)|insulated]] from each other everywhere, except at the sensing junction. Any additional electrical contact between the wires, or contact of a wire to other conductive objects, can modify the voltage and give a false reading of temperature.\n\nPlastics are suitable insulators for low temperatures parts of a thermocouple, whereas ceramic insulation can be used up to around 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C. Other concerns (abrasion and chemical resistance) also affect the suitability of materials.\n\nWhen wire insulation disintegrates, it can result in an unintended electrical contact at a different location from the desired sensing point. If such a damaged thermocouple is used in the closed loop control of a [[thermostat]] or other [[temperature control]]ler, this can lead to a runaway overheating event and possibly severe damage, as the false temperature reading will typically be lower than the sensing junction temperature. Failed insulation will also typically [[outgas]], which can lead to process contamination. For parts of thermocouples used at very high temperatures or in contamination-sensitive applications, the only suitable insulation may be [[vacuum]] or [[inert gas]]; the mechanical rigidity of the thermocouple wires is used to keep them separated.\n\n===Table of insulation materials===\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2014}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

If the pilot flame goes out, unburned gas may be released, which is an explosion risk and a health hazard. To prevent this, some appliances use a thermocouple in a [[fail-safe]] circuit to sense when the pilot light is burning. The tip of the thermocouple is placed in the pilot flame, generating a voltage which operates the supply valve which feeds gas to the pilot. So long as the pilot flame remains lit, the thermocouple remains hot, and the pilot gas valve is held open. If the pilot light goes out, the thermocouple temperature falls, causing the voltage across the thermocouple to drop and the valve to close.\n\nSome combined main burner and pilot gas valves (mainly by [[Honeywell]]) reduce the power demand to within the range of a single universal thermocouple heated by a pilot (25 mV open circuit falling by half with the coil connected to a 10\u201312 mV, 0.2\u20130.25 A source, typically) by sizing the coil to be able to hold the valve open against a light spring, but only after the initial turning-on force is provided by the user pressing and holding a knob to compress the spring during lighting of the pilot. These systems are identifiable by the \"press and hold for x minutes\" in the pilot lighting instructions. (The holding current requirement of such a valve is much less than a bigger solenoid designed for pulling the valve in from a closed position would require.) Special test sets are made to confirm the valve let-go and holding currents, because an ordinary milliammeter cannot be used as it introduces more resistance than the gas valve coil. Apart from testing the open circuit voltage of the thermocouple, and the near short-circuit DC continuity through the thermocouple gas valve coil, the easiest non-specialist test is substitution of a known good gas valve.\n\nSome systems, known as millivolt control systems, extend the thermocouple concept to both open and close the main gas valve as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot gas valve, it is also routed through a [[thermostat]] to power the main gas valve as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a [[thermopile]] is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common [[forced air furnace]]s because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered [[convection heater]]s. A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed to ensure that the main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner gas supply valve should that not happen.\n\nOut of concern about energy wasted by the standing pilot flame, designers of many newer appliances have switched to an electronically controlled pilot-less ignition, also called intermittent ignition. With no standing pilot flame, there is no risk of gas buildup should the flame go out, so these appliances do not need thermocouple-based pilot safety switches. As these designs lose the benefit of operation without a continuous source of electricity, standing pilots are still used in some appliances. The exception is later model instantaneous (aka \"tankless\") [[tankless water heater|water heaters]] that use the flow of water to generate the current required to ignite the gas burner; these designs also use a thermocouple as a safety cut-off device in the event the gas fails to ignite, or if the flame is extinguished.\n\n===Thermopile radiation sensors===\nThermopiles are used for measuring the intensity of incident radiation, typically visible or infrared light, which heats the hot junctions, while the cold junctions are on a heat sink. It is possible to measure radiative [[intensity (physics)|intensities]] of only a few \u03bcW/cm<sup>2</sup> with commercially available thermopile sensors. For example, some [[laser]] [[power (physics)|power]] meters are based on such sensors; these are specifically known as [[Thermopile Laser Sensors|thermopile laser sensor]].\n\nThe principle of operation of a thermopile sensor is distinct from that of a [[bolometer]], as the latter relies on a change in resistance.\n\n===Manufacturing===\nThermocouples can generally be used in the testing of prototype electrical and mechanical apparatus. For example, [[switchgear]] under test for its current carrying capacity may have thermocouples installed and monitored during a heat run test, to confirm that the temperature rise at rated current does not exceed designed limits.\n\n===Power production===\n{{main article|Thermoelectric generator }}\nA thermocouple can produce current to drive some processes directly, without the need for extra circuitry and power sources. For example, the power from a thermocouple can activate a valve when a temperature difference arises. The [[electrical energy]] generated by a thermocouple is converted from the [[heat]] which must be supplied to the hot side to maintain the electric potential. A continuous transfer of heat is necessary because the current flowing through the thermocouple tends to cause the hot side to cool down and the cold side to heat up (the [[Peltier effect]]).\n\nThermocouples can be connected in series to form a [[thermopile]], where all the hot junctions are exposed to a higher temperature and all the cold junctions to a lower temperature. The output is the sum of the voltages across the individual junctions, giving larger voltage and power output. In a [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]], the [[radioactive decay]] of [[transuranic elements]] as a heat source has been used to power spacecraft on missions too far from the Sun to use solar power.\n\nThermopiles heated by [[kerosene lamp]]s were used to run [[batteryless radio]] receivers in isolated areas.<ref>{{cite book|title=New Scientist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B-ve-ZR6QRIC&pg=PA67|accessdate=28 May 2012|date=10 January 1974|publisher=Reed Business Information|pages=67\u2013|issn=0262-4079}}</ref> There are commercially produced lanterns that use the heat from a candle to run several light-emitting diodes, and thermoelectrically-powered fans to improve air circulation and heat distribution in [[wood stove]]s.\n\n===Process plants===\nChemical production and petroleum refineries will usually employ computers for logging and for limit testing the many temperatures associated with a process, typically numbering in the hundreds. For such cases, a number of thermocouple leads will be brought to a common reference block (a large block of copper) containing the second thermocouple of each circuit. The temperature of the block is in turn measured by a [[thermistor]]. Simple computations are used to determine the temperature at each measured location.\n\n===Thermocouple as vacuum gauge===\n{{see also|Pressure measurement#Thermal conductivity}}\nA thermocouple can be used as a [[vacuum gauge]] over the range of approximately 0.001 to 1 [[torr]] absolute pressure.  In this pressure range, the [[mean free path]] of the gas is comparable to the dimensions of the [[vacuum chamber]], and the flow regime is neither purely [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations|viscous]] nor purely [[Knudsen flow|molecular]].<ref>Hablanian, M. H. (1997) ''High-Vacuum Technology: A Practical Guide, Second Ed.'', Marcel Dekker Inc., pp. 19\u201322, 45\u201347 & 438\u2013443, ISBN 0-8247-9834-1.</ref>  In this configuration, the thermocouple junction is attached to the centre of a short heating wire, which is usually energised by a constant current of about 5&nbsp;mA, and the heat is removed at a rate related to the thermal conductivity of the gas. It may be possible to superimpose AC heating on the thermocouple directly, making the sensor a 2-wire device, but those on the market appear{{source?|date=August 2016}} to all be 4-wire devices, with separate terminals for the heater and the thermocouple.\n\nThe temperature detected at the thermocouple junction depends on the [[thermal conductivity]] of the surrounding gas, which depends on the [[pressure]] of the gas.  The potential difference measured by a thermocouple is proportional to the [[Square number|square]] of pressure over the [[Vacuum#Measurement|low- to medium-vacuum]] range.  At higher (viscous flow) and lower (molecular flow) pressures, the thermal conductivity of air or any other gas is essentially independent of pressure.  The thermocouple was first used as a vacuum gauge by Voege in 1906.<ref>Voege, W. (1906) ''Physik Zeit.'', '''7''': 498.</ref>  The mathematical model for the thermocouple as a vacuum gauge is quite complicated, as explained in detail by Van Atta,<ref>Van Atta, C. M. (1965) ''Vacuum Science and Engineering'', McGraw-Hill Book Co. pp. 78\u201390.</ref> but can be simplified to:\n: <math>P = \\frac{B (V^2 - V_0^2)}{V_0^2}, </math>\nwhere ''P'' is the gas pressure, ''B'' is a constant that depends on the thermocouple temperature, the gas composition and the vacuum-chamber geometry, ''V''<sub>0</sub> is the thermocouple voltage at zero pressure (absolute), and ''V'' is the voltage indicated by the thermocouple.\n\nThe alternative is the [[Pirani gauge]], which operates in a similar way, over approximately the same pressure range, but is only a 2-terminal device, sensing the change in resistance with temperature of a thin electrically heated wire, rather than using a thermocouple.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Heat flux sensor]]\n*[[Bolometer]]\n*[[Giuseppe Domenico Botto]]\n*[[Resistance thermometer]]\n*[[Thermistor]]\n*[[Thermopower|Thermoelectric power]]\n*[[List of sensors]]\n*[[International Temperature Scale of 1990]]\n*[[Bimetal]] (mechanical)\n*Sculpture ''Thermocouple'' (1977) of [[Piotr Kowalski]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Thermocouples}}\n*[http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/utc/thermocouple/pages/ThermocouplesOperatingPrinciples.html Thermocouple Operating Principle \u2013 University Of Cambridge]\n*[http://www.temperaturemonitoringuae.com/products/thermocouple Thermocouple]\n*[http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/utc/thermocouple/pages/Drift.html Thermocouple Drift \u2013 University Of Cambridge]\n*[http://www.analog.com/library/analogDialogue/archives/44-10/thermocouple.pdf Two Ways to Measure Temperature Using Thermocouples]\n*[http://www.peaksensors.co.uk/designguide.html Thermocouple design guide]\n*[http://www.isomil.de/en/mineral-insulated-cable.htm Mineral-Insulated Thermocouple Know-How]\n*[http://www.ecd.com/news/articles/tc-attachment.asp Thermocouple Attachment \u2013 A Primer]\n<!--\nPLEASE DO NOT ADD YOUR COMPANY TO THIS LIST.
