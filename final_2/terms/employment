Employees in some fields or sectors may receive [[gratuity|gratuities]], bonus payments or [[stock option]]s. In some types of employment, employees may receive benefits in addition to payment. Benefits can include [[health insurance]], [[housing]], disability insurance or use of a gym. Employment is typically governed by employment laws or regulations and/or legal contracts.\n\n== {{anchor|Employee}} Employees and employers ==\n{{Further|List of largest employers|List of professions|Tradesman}}\nAn '''employee''' contributes labor and expertise to an endeavor of an '''employer''' or of a person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU)<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Archer\n| first1 = Richard\n| last2 = Borthwick\n| first2 = Kerry\n| author-link2 = \n| last3 = Travers\n| first3 = Michelle\n| last4 = Ruschena\n| first4 = Leo\n| title = WHS: A Management Guide\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cQapBQAAQBAJ&\n| edition = 4\n| publisher = Cengage Learning Australia\n| publication-date = 2014\n| page = 30-31\n| isbn = 9780170270793\n| access-date = 2016-03-30\n| quote = The most significant definitions are 'person conducting a business or undertaking' (PCBU).

Employers must balance interests such as decreasing wage constraints with a maximization of labor productivity in order to achieve a profitable and productive employment relationship.\n\n===Finding employees or employment===\nThe main ways for [[employer]]s to find workers and for people to find employers are via jobs listings in newspapers (via [[classified advertising]]) and online, also called [[job board]]s. Employers and job seekers also often find each other via professional [[recruitment consultant]]s which receive a [[commission (remuneration)|commission]] from the employer to find, screen and select suitable candidates. However, a study has shown that such consultants may not be reliable when they fail to use established principles in selecting employees.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/paperpdf/Predicting%20job%20performance.pdf | title = Predicting job performance: A comparison of expert opinion and research findings | author = Stephen Dakin and J.

An appropriate level of training and development helps to improve employee's [[job satisfaction]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Remuneration===\nThere are many ways that employees are paid, including by hourly wages, by [[piecework]], by yearly [[salary]], or by [[gratuity|gratuities]] (with the latter often being combined with another form of payment. In sales jobs and real estate positions, the employee may be paid a [[commission (remuneration)|commission]], a percentage of the value of the goods or services that they have sold. In some fields and professions (e.g., executive jobs), employees may be eligible for a bonus if they meet certain targets. Some executives and employees may be paid in [[stock]]s or [[stock option]]s, a compensation approach that has the added benefit, from the company's point of view, of helping to align the interests of the compensated individual with the performance of the company.\n\n===Employee benefits===\n[[Employee benefits]] are various non-wage compensation provided to employee in addition to their wages or salaries.  The benefits can include:  housing (employer-provided or employer-paid), group insurance (health, dental, life etc.), disability income protection, retirement benefits, daycare, tuition reimbursement, sick leave, vacation (paid and non-paid), social security, profit sharing, funding of education, and other specialized benefits. In some cases, such as with workers employed in remote or isolated regions, the benefits may include meals.  Employee benefits can improve the relationship between employee and employer and lowers staff turnover.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Organizational justice ===\n[[Organizational justice]] is an employee's perception and judgement of employer's treatment in the context of fairness or justice.  The resulting actions to influence the employee-employer relationship is also a part of organizational justice.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Workforce organizing ===\nEmployees can organize into trade or [[labor union]]s, which represent the work force to collectively bargain with the management of organizations about working, and contractual conditions and services.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Ending employment ===\nUsually, either an employee or employer may end the relationship at any time, often subject to a certain notice period. This is referred to as [[at-will employment]]. The contract between the two parties specifies the responsibilities of each when ending the relationship and may include requirements such as notice periods, [[severance pay]], and security measures.<ref name=\":6\" /> In some professions, notably teaching, civil servants, university professors, and some orchestra jobs, some employees may have [[tenure]], which means that they cannot be dismissed at will.\n\n==Wage labor==\n{{main|Wage labor}}\n[[File:Rebar worker.jpg|thumb|Worker assembling [[rebar]] for a water treatment plant in [[Mazatlan]], [[Sinaloa]], [[Mexico]].]]\n\nWage labor is the [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] relationship between a [[Workforce|worker]] and an employer, where the worker sells their [[Labour economics|labor]] under a formal or informal employment [[contract]].

The employment can be ended at any time without giving any reason. This type of employment can be offered only once per employer and employee combination. Usually a time limited or normal employment is offered after a test employment.<ref name=\"ODI2\" />\n*Time limited employment (''swe: Tidsbegr\u00e4nsad anst\u00e4llning'').

It can still be ended for two reasons: '''personal reason''', immediate end of employment only for strong reasons such as crime, or '''lack of work tasks''' (''swe: Arbetsbrist''), cancellation of employment, usually because of bad income for the company. There is a cancellation period of 1\u20136 months, and rules for how to select employees, basically those with shortest employment time shall be cancelled first.<ref name=\"ODI2\" />\nThere are no laws about [[minimum wage|minimum salary]] in Sweden. Instead there are agreements between employer organizations and trade unions about minimum salaries, and other employment conditions.\n\nThere is a type of employment contract which is common but not regulated in law, and that is Hour employment (''swe: Timanst\u00e4llning''), which can be Normal employment (unlimited), but the work time is unregulated and decided per immediate need basis. The employee is expected to be answering the phone and come to work when needed, e.g. when someone is ill and absent from work. They will receive salary only for actual work time and can in reality be fired for no reason by not being called anymore.

Increases in employment without increases in productivity leads to a rise in the number of \"working poor\", which is why some experts are now promoting the creation of \"quality\" and not \"quantity\" in labor market policies.<ref name=ODI2/> This approach does highlight how higher productivity has helped reduce poverty in [[East Asia]], but the negative impact is beginning to show.<ref name=ODI2/> In [[Vietnam]], for example, employment growth has slowed while productivity growth has continued.<ref name=ODI2/> Furthermore, productivity increases do not always lead to increased wages, as can be seen in the [[United States]], where the gap between productivity and wages has been rising since the 1980s.<ref name=ODI2/>\n\nResearchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] argue that there are differences across [[economic sector]]s in creating employment that reduces poverty.<ref name=ODI2/> 24 instances of growth were examined, in which 18 reduced poverty.

(2004) ''Theoretical Perspectives on Work and the Employment Relationship'', Industrial Relations Research Association.</ref> A key assumption is the extent to which the employment relationship necessarily includes conflicts of interests between employers and employees, and the form of such conflicts.<ref>Fox, Alan (1974) ''Beyond Contract: Work, Power and Trust Relations'', Farber and Farber.</ref> In economic theorizing, the labor market mediates all such conflicts such that employers and employees who enter into an employment relationship are assumed to find this arrangement in their own self-interest. In human resource management theorizing, employers and employees are assumed to have shared interests (or a unity of interests, hence the label \u201cunitarism\u201d). Any conflicts that exist are seen as a manifestation of poor human resource management policies or interpersonal clashes such as personality conflicts, both of which can and should be managed away. From the perspective of pluralist industrial relations, the employment relationship is characterized by a plurality of stakeholders with legitimate interests (hence the label \u201cpluralism), and some conflicts of interests are seen as inherent in the employment relationship (e.g., wages v. profits). Lastly, the critical paradigm emphasizes antagonistic conflicts of interests between various groups (e.g., the competing capitalist and [[working classes]] in a Marxist framework) that are part of a deeper social conflict of unequal power relations. As a result, there are four common models of employment:<ref>Budd, John W. and Bhave, Devasheesh (2008) \"Values, Ideologies, and Frames of Reference in Industrial Relations,\" in ''Sage Handbook of Industrial Relations'', Sage.</ref>\n\n# Mainstream economics: employment is seen as a mutually advantageous transaction in a free market between self-interested legal and economic equals\n# [[Human resource management]] (unitarism): employment is a long-term partnership of employees and employers with common interests\n# [[Industrial relations|Pluralist industrial relations]]: employment is a bargained exchange between stakeholders with some common and some competing economic interests and unequal bargaining power due to imperfect labor markets<ref name=\"ODI2\" />\n# Critical [[industrial relations]]: employment is an unequal power relation between competing groups that is embedded in and inseparable from systemic inequalities throughout the socio-politico-economic system.\n\nThese models are important because they help reveal why individuals hold differing perspectives on human resource management policies, labor unions, and employment regulation.<ref>Befort, Stephen F. and Budd, John W. (2009) ''Invisible Hands, Invisible Objectives: Bringing Workplace Law and Public Policy Into Focus'', Stanford University Press.</ref> For example, human resource management policies are seen as dictated by the market in the first view, as essential mechanisms for aligning the interests of employees and employers and thereby creating profitable companies in the second view, as insufficient for looking out for workers\u2019 interests in the third view, and as manipulative managerial tools for shaping the ideology and structure of the workplace in the fourth view.<ref>Budd, John W. and Bhave, Devasheesh (2010) \"The Employment Relationship,\" in ''Sage Handbook of Handbook of Human Resource Management'', Sage.</ref>\n\n==Academic literature==\nLiterature on the employment impact of economic growth and on how growth is associated with employment at a macro, sector and industry level was aggregated in 2013.<ref name=\"partnerplatform.org\">Yurendra Basnett and Ritwika Sen, What do empirical studies say about economic growth and job creation in developing countries?

With trade, industry and investment, they only found limited evidence of positive impact on employment from industrial and investment policies and for others, while large bodies of evidence does exist, the exact impact remains contested.<ref name=\"partnerplatform.org\"/>\n\n== Globalization and employment relations ==\nThe balance of economic efficiency and social equity is the ultimate debate in the field of [[industrial relations|employment relations]].<ref name=\":9\">Budd, John W. (2004) ''Employment with a Human Face: Balancing Efficiency, Equity, and Voice'', Cornell University Press.</ref> By meeting the needs of the employer; generating profits to establish and maintain economic efficiency; whilst maintaining a balance with the employee and creating social equity that benefits the worker so that he/she can fund and enjoy healthy living; proves to be a continuous revolving issue in westernized societies.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n[[Globalization]] has effected these issues by creating certain economic factors that disallow or allow various employment issues. Economist Edward Lee (1996) studies the effects of globalization and summarizes the four major points of concern that affect employment relations:\n# International competition, from the [[newly industrialized countries]], will cause unemployment growth and increased wage disparity for unskilled workers in industrialized countries. Imports from low-wage countries exert pressure on the manufacturing sector in industrialized countries and foreign direct investment (FDI) is attracted away from the industrialized nations, towards low-waged countries.<ref name=\":9\" />\n# Economic liberalization will result in unemployment and wage inequality in developing countries. This happens as job losses in uncompetitive industries outstrip job opportunities in new industries.\n# Workers will be forced to accept worsening wages and conditions, as a global labor market results in a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d. Increased international competition creates a pressure to reduce the wages and conditions of workers.<ref name=\":9\" />\n# Globalization reduces the autonomy of the nation state. Capital is increasingly mobile and the ability of the state to regulate economic activity is reduced.\n\nWhat also results from Lee\u2019s (1996) findings is that in industrialized countries an average of almost 70 per cent of workers are employed in the service sector, most of which consists of non-tradable activities. As a result, workers are forced to become more skilled and develop sought after trades, or find other means of survival. Ultimately this is a result of changes and trends of employment, an evolving workforce, and globalization that is represented by a more skilled and increasing highly diverse labor force, that are growing in non standard forms of employment (Markey, R. et al. 2006).<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==Alternatives==\n\n===Subcultures===\nVarious youth subcultures have been associated with not working, such as the [[Hippy]] subculture in the 1960s and 1970s (which endorsed the idea of \"dropping out\" of society) and the [[punk subculture]], in which some members live in [[anarchy|anarchist]] [[squatting|squat]]s (illegal housing).\n\n===Postsecondary education===\nOne of the alternatives to work is engaging in postsecondary education at a [[college]], [[university]] or [[professional school]]. One of the major costs of obtaining a postsecondary education is the [[opportunity cost]] of forgone wages due to not working. At times when jobs are hard to find, such as during recessions, unemployed individuals may decide to get postsecondary education, because there is less of an opportunity cost.\n\n===Workplace democracy===\n{{main|Workplace democracy}}\nWorkplace democracy is the application of [[democracy]] in all its forms (including [[voting system]]s, [[debate]]s, [[democratic structuring]], [[due process]], [[adversarial process]], systems of appeal) to the [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]].<ref name=\":10\">{{cite news |last=Rayasam|first=Renuka|title=Why Workplace Democracy Can Be Good Business|url=http://money.usnews.com/money/careers/articles/2008/04/24/why-workplace-democracy-can-be-good-business.html|accessdate=16 August 2010|newspaper=[[U.S. News & World Report]]|date=24 April 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Self-employment===\nWhen an individual entirely owns the business for which they labor, this is known as [[self-employment]]. Self-employment often leads to [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]]. Incorporation offers certain protections of one's personal assets.<ref name=\":9\" /> Individuals who are self-employed may own a [[small business]]. They may also be considered to be an [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]].\n\n===Social assistance===\nIn some countries, individuals who are not working can receive [[social assistance]] support (e.g., [[welfare]] or [[Food Stamp Program|Food stamps]]) to enable them to rent housing,buy food, repair or replace household goods, maintenance of children and observe social customs that require financial expenditure.\n\n===Volunteerism===\nWorkers who are not paid wages, such as [[volunteer]]s who perform tasks for charities, hospitals or not-for-profit organizations, are generally not considered employed. One exception to this is an [[internship]], an employment situation in which the worker receives training or experience (and possibly college credit) as the chief form of compensation.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n===Indenturing and slavery===\nThose who work under obligation for the purpose of fulfilling a debt, such as an [[indentured servant]], or as property of the person or entity they work for, such as a [[slavery|slave]], do not receive pay for their services and are not considered employed. Some historians suggest that slavery is older than employment, but both arrangements have existed for all recorded history. Indenturing and slavery are not considered compatible with [[human rights]] and [[democracy]].<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Automation]]\n* [[Basic income]]\n* [[Domestic inquiry]]\n* [[Employer branding]]\n* [[Employment gap]]\n* [[Employment rate]]\n* [[Employment website]]\n* [[Equal opportunity employment]]\n* [[Equal pay for equal work]]\n* [[Ethnic Penalty]]\n* [[Job analysis]]\n* [[Job description]]\n* [[Jobless recovery]]\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Labor economics]]\n* [[Labor power]]\n* [[List of largest employers]]\n* [[Lump of labor fallacy]]\n* [[Onboarding]]\n* [[Payroll]]\n* [[Personnel selection]]\n* [[Protestant work ethic]]\n* [[Reserve army of labor]] (Marxism)\n* [[Staffing models]]\n* [[Tenure]]\n* ''[[The End of Work]]''\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book|last=[[Nicola Acocella|Acocella, Nicola]]|title=Social pacts, employment and growth: a reappraisal of Ezio Tarantelli\u2019s thought|publisher=Springer Verlag|location=Heidelberg|year=2007|isbn=978-3-790-81915-1}}\n* {{cite book|last=Dubin|first=Robert|title=The World of Work: Industrial Society and Human Relations|year=1958|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J|oclc=964691|page=213}}\n* {{Cite book|last1=Freeman |first1= Richard B. |authorlink1= Richard B.
