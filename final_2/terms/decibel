[[logarithmic unit]] used to express the ratio of two values of a [[physical quantity]]. One of these values is often a standard reference value, in which case the decibel is used to express the [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|level]]{{efn|The international standard definition of ''level'' here as the logarithm of a power ratio should not be confused with the [[amplitude]] of a field quantity. See [[Field, power, and root-power quantities]] for further terminology discussion.}} of the other value relative to this reference.\n\nThe number of decibels is ten times the [[Common logarithm|logarithm to base 10]] of the ratio of two power quantities.<ref>''IEEE Standard 100 Dictionary of IEEE Standards Terms, Seventh Edition'', The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, New York, 2000; ISBN 0-7381-2601-2; page 288</ref> A change in power by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 10&nbsp;dB change in level. At the [[half power point]] an audio circuit or an antenna exhibits an [[attenuation]] of approximately 3&nbsp;dB. A change in amplitude by a factor of 10 results in a change in power by a factor of 100, which corresponds to a 20&nbsp;dB change in level. A change in amplitude ratio by a factor of 2 (equivalently factor of 4 in power change) approximately corresponds to a 6&nbsp;dB change in level.\n\nThe definition of the decibel is based on the measurement of power in [[telephony]] of the early 20th century in the [[Bell System]] in the United States. One decibel is one tenth of one '''bel''', named in honor of [[Alexander Graham Bell]]; however, the bel is seldom used. Today, the decibel is used for a wide variety of measurements in science and [[engineering]], most prominently in [[acoustics]], [[electronics]], and [[control theory]]. In electronics, the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]]s of amplifiers, [[attenuation]] of signals, and [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s are often expressed in decibels. \n\nIn the [[International System of Quantities]], the decibel is defined as a [[unit of measurement]] for quantities of type level or level difference, which are defined as the [[logarithm]] of the ratio of [[Field, power, and root-power quantities|power- or field-type quantities]].<ref name=\"standardization2006\">{{cite web|title=ISO 80000-3:2006|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=31888|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]]|accessdate=20 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe decibel symbol is often qualified with a suffix that indicates the reference quantity that has been used or some other property of the quantity being measured. For example, [[dBm]] indicates a reference power of one [[milliwatt]], while [[#Voltage|dBV]] is referenced to 1 [[volt]].<ref name = \"clqgmk\"/>\n\n=={{anchor|MSC|TU|bel}}History==\nThe decibel originates from methods used to quantify signal loss in telegraph and telephone circuits. The unit for loss was originally ''Miles of Standard Cable'' (MSC). 1&nbsp;MSC corresponded to the loss of power over a 1 [[mile]] (approximately 1.6&nbsp;km) length of standard telephone cable at a frequency of 5000 [[radian]]s per second (795.8&nbsp;Hz), and matched closely the smallest attenuation detectable to the average listener. The standard telephone cable implied was \"a cable having uniformly distributed resistance of 88 ohms per loop mile and uniformly distributed [[shunt (electrical)|shunt]] [[capacitance]] of 0.054 microfarad per mile\" (approximately 19 [[wire gauge|gauge]]).<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Kenneth Simonds |title=Transmission Circuits for Telephonic Communication: Methods of Analysis and Design |year=1944 |publisher=D.

The introduction of cable in 1896 afforded a stable basis for a convenient unit and the \"mile of standard\" cable came into general use shortly thereafter. This unit was employed up to 1923 when a new unit was adopted as being more suitable for modern telephone work. The new transmission unit is widely used among the foreign telephone organizations and recently it was termed the \"decibel\" at the suggestion of the International Advisory Committee on Long Distance Telephony.\n\nThe decibel may be defined by the statement that two amounts of power differ by 1 decibel when they are in the ratio of 10<sup>0.1</sup> and any two amounts of power differ by ''N'' decibels when they are in the ratio of 10<sup>'N''(0.1)</sup>. The number of transmission units expressing the ratio of any two powers is therefore ten times the common logarithm of that ratio. This method of designating the gain or loss of power in telephone circuits permits direct addition or subtraction of the units expressing the efficiency of different parts of the circuit...}}\n\nIn April 2003, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) considered a recommendation for the inclusion of the decibel in the [[International System of Units]] (SI), but decided against the proposal.<ref>[http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/CC/CCU/CCU16.pdf Consultative Committee for Units, Meeting minutes], Section 3</ref>  However, the decibel is recognized by other international bodies such as the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) and [[International Organization for Standardization]]  (ISO).<ref name=IEC60027-3>[http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/028981 \"Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology \u2013 Part 3: Logarithmic and related quantities, and their units\"], ''IEC 60027-3 Ed. 3.0'', International Electrotechnical Commission, 19 July 2002.</ref>  The IEC permits the use of the decibel with field quantities as well as power and this recommendation is followed by many national standards bodies, such as [[NIST]], which justifies the use of the decibel for voltage ratios.<ref name=NIST2008/>  The term ''field quantity'' is [[deprecation|deprecated]] by ISO 80000-1, which favors [[#Field quantities|root-power]].  In spite of their widespread use, [[#Suffixes and reference values|suffixes]] (such as in [[A-weighting|dBA]] or dBV) are not recognized by the IEC or ISO.\n\n==Definition==\nThe ISO Standard [[ISO/IEC 80000|80000-3:2006]] defines the following quantities. The decibel (dB) is one tenth of a bel: {{nobreak|1=1 dB = 0.1 B}}. The bel (B) is {{1/2}}&nbsp;ln(10) [[neper]]s: {{nobreak|1=1 B = {{1/2}} ln(10) Np}}. \n\nThe neper is the change in the [[level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] of a field quantity when the field quantity changes by a factor of [[e (mathematical constant)|e]], that is {{nobreak|1=1 Np = ln(e) = 1}}, thereby relating all of the units as nondimensional natural log of field-quantity ratios, {{nobreak|1=1 dB = 0.11513\u2026 Np = 0.11513\u2026}}. Therefore, the bel represents the logarithm of a ratio between two power quantities of 10:1, or the logarithm of a ratio between two field quantities of \u221a10:1.<ref>{{Cite news|title=International Standard CEI-IEC 27-3 Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology Part 3: Logarithmic quantities and units | publisher=International Electrotechnical Commission}}</ref>\n\nTwo signals whose levels differ by one decibel have a power ratio of 10<sup>1/10</sup>, which is approximately 1.25892, and an amplitude (field quantity) ratio of 10<sup>{{frac|20}}</sup> (1.12202).<ref>{{cite book |last=Mark |first=James E. |title=Physical Properties of Polymers Handbook |location= |publisher=Springer |year=2007 |page=1025 |quote=\u2026 the decibel represents a reduction in power of 1.258 times. }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Yost |first=William |title=Fundamentals of Hearing: An Introduction |location= |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |edition=Second |year=1985 |page=206 |isbn=0-12-772690-X |quote=\u2026 a pressure ratio of 1.122 equals + 1.0 dB }}</ref>\n\nThe bel is rarely used either without a prefix or with [[metric prefix|SI unit prefixes]] other than ''[[deci-|deci]]''; it is preferred, for example, to use ''hundredths of a decibel'' rather than ''millibels''.

The number of decibels is ten times the number of bels.  ''P'' and ''P''<sub>0</sub> must measure the same type of quantity, and have the same units before calculating the ratio. If {{nobreak|1=''P'' = ''P''<sub>0</sub>}} in the above equation, then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> = 0. If ''P'' is greater than ''P''<sub>0</sub> then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> is positive; if ''P'' is less than ''P''<sub>0</sub> then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> is negative.\n\nRearranging the above equation gives the following formula for ''P'' in terms of ''P''<sub>0</sub> and ''L''<sub>''P''</sub>:\n:<math>\nP = 10^\\frac{L_P}{10\\,\\mathrm{dB}} P_0.\n</math>\n\n===Field quantities and root-power quantities===\n{{main article|Field, power, and root-power quantities}}\nWhen referring to measurements of field quantities, it is usual to consider the ratio of the squares of ''F'' (measured field) and ''F''<sub>0</sub> (reference field). This is because in most applications power is proportional to the square of field, and it is desirable for the two decibel formulations to give the same result in such typical cases. Thus, the following definition is used:\n:<math>\nL_F = \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{Np} = 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{F^2}{F_0^2}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{dB} = 20 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{dB}.\n</math>\n\nThe formula may be rearranged to give\n:<math>\nF = 10^\\frac{L_F}{20\\,\\mathrm{dB}} F_0.\n</math>\n\nSimilarly, in [[Electronic circuit|electrical circuits]], dissipated power is typically proportional to the square of [[voltage]] or [[Electric current|current]] when the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is held constant. Taking voltage as an example, this leads to the equation:\n:<math>\nG_\\mathrm{dB} = 20 \\log_{10}\\!\\left (\\frac{V}{V_0}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{dB},\n</math>\nwhere ''V'' is the voltage being measured, ''V''<sub>0</sub> is a specified reference voltage, and ''G''<sub>dB</sub> is the power gain expressed in decibels. A similar formula holds for current.\n\nThe term ''root-power quantity'' is introduced by ISO Standard [[ISO/IEC 80000|80000-1:2009]] as a substitute of ''field quantity''.  The term ''field quantity'' is deprecated by that standard.\n\n===Conversions===\nSince logarithm differences measured in these units are used to represent power ratios and field ratios, the values of the ratios represented by each unit are also included in the table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Conversion between units of level and a list of corresponding ratios\n!Unit !!

The unit dBW is often used to denote a ratio for which the reference is 1 W, and similarly dBm for a {{nobreak|1 mW}} reference point.\n* Calculating the ratio of {{nobreak|1 kW}} (one kilowatt, or 1000 watts) to {{nobreak|1 W}} in decibels yields:\n::<math>\nG_\\mathrm{dB} = 10 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{1000~\\mathrm{W}}{1~\\mathrm{W}}\\right) = 30.\n</math>\n* The ratio of {{nobreak|1=\u221a1000 V \u2248 31.62 V}} to {{nobreak|1 V}} in decibels is\n::<math>\nG_\\mathrm{dB} = 20 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{31.62~\\mathrm{V}}{1~\\mathrm{V}}\\right) = 30.\n</math>\n{{nobreak|1=(31.62 V/1 V)<sup>2</sup> \u2248 1 kW/1 W}}, illustrating the consequence from the definitions above that ''G''<sub>dB</sub> has the same value, 30, regardless of whether it is obtained from powers or from amplitudes, provided that in the specific system being considered power ratios are equal to amplitude ratios squared.\n* The ratio of {{nobreak|1 mW}} (one milliwatt) to {{nobreak|10 W}} in decibels is obtained with the formula\n::<math>\nG_\\mathrm{dB} = 10 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{0.001~\\mathrm{W}}{10~\\mathrm{W}}\\right) = -40.\n</math>\n* The power ratio corresponding to a {{nobreak|3 dB}} change in level is given by\n::<math>\nG = 10^\\frac{3}{10} \\times 1 = 1.99526... \\approx 2.\n</math>\n\nA change in power ratio by a factor of 10 corresponds to a change in level of {{nobreak|10 dB}}. A change in power ratio by a factor of 2 is approximately a [[3dB-point|change of 3&nbsp;dB]]. More precisely, the factor is 10<sup>{{frac|3|10}}</sup>, or 1.9953, about 0.24% different from exactly 2. Similarly, an increase of {{nobreak|3 dB}} implies an increase in voltage by a factor of approximately {{sqrt|2}}, or about 1.41, an increase of {{nobreak|6 dB}} corresponds to approximately four times the power and twice the voltage, and so on. In exact terms the power ratio is 10<sup>{{frac|6|10}}</sup>, or about 3.9811, a relative error of about 0.5%.\n\n===Calculations===\nIn order to add or subtract levels the values that are expressed in decibel first must be divided by 10 (or 20). The definition of the decibel in ISO 80000-3 assigns a value to the decibel (approximately 0.11513) thus the division by 10 in formulas for the addition or subtraction of levels should be a division by 10&nbsp;dB. Ignoring that can cause a mistake of a factor of 8.686 in the number of decibels. None of the formulas published in ISO standards regarding noise and acoustics take this into account and they shall be used as if the decibel has no value (or is unity). {{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n==Properties==\nThe decibel has the following properties:\n* The [[logarithmic scale]] nature of the decibel means that a very large range of ratios can be represented by a convenient number, in a similar manner to [[scientific notation]]. This allows one to clearly visualize huge changes of some quantity. See [[Bode plot]] and [[semi-log plot]].  For example, 120&nbsp;dB SPL may be clearer than \"a trillion times more intense than the threshold of hearing\".\n* Level values in decibels can be added instead of multiplying the underlying power values, which means that the overall gain of a multi-component system, such as a series of [[amplifier]] stages, can be calculated by summing the gains in decibels of the individual components, rather than multiply the amplification factors; that is, log(''A''&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;''B''&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;''C'') = log(''A'') + log(''B'') + log(''C''). Practically, this means that, armed only with the knowledge that 1&nbsp;dB is approximately 26% power gain, 3&nbsp;dB is approximately 2\u00d7 power gain, and 10&nbsp;dB is 10\u00d7 power gain, it is possible to determine the power ratio of a system from the gain in dB with only simple addition and multiplication. For example:\n*:A system consists of 3 amplifiers in series, with gains (ratio of power out to in) of 10&nbsp;dB, 8&nbsp;dB, and 7&nbsp;dB respectively, for a total gain of 25&nbsp;dB. Broken into combinations of 10, 3, and 1&nbsp;dB, this is:\n*:: 25&nbsp;dB = 10&nbsp;dB + 10&nbsp;dB + 3&nbsp;dB + 1&nbsp;dB + 1&nbsp;dB\n*:With an input of 1 watt, the output is approximately\n*:: 1 W x 10 x 10 x 2 x 1.26 x 1.26  \u2248 317.5&nbsp;W\n*: Calculated exactly, the output is 1&nbsp;W x 10<sup>{{frac|25|10}}</sup> = 316.2&nbsp;W. The approximate value has an error of only +0.4% with respect to the actual value which is negligible given the precision of the values supplied and the accuracy of most measurement instrumentation.\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages==\n{{procon|date=April 2015}}\n\n===Supporting arguments===\nAccording to Mitschke,<ref>{{cite book |title=Fiber Optics |location= |publisher=Springer |year=2010 |pages= }}</ref> \"The advantage of using a logarithmic measure is that in a transmission chain, there are many elements concatenated, and each has its own gain or attenuation. To obtain the total, addition of decibel values is much more convenient than multiplication of the individual factors.\"\n\nThe human perception of the intensity of sound and light approximates the logarithm of intensity rather than a linear relationship ([[Weber\u2013Fechner law]]), making the dB scale a useful measure.<ref>{{Google books |id=1SMXAAAAQBAJ |page=268 |title=Sensation and Perception }}</ref><ref>{{Google books |id=BggrpTek5kAC |page=SA19-PA9 |title=Introduction to Understandable Physics, Volume 2 }}</ref><ref>{{Google books |id=ukvei0wge_8C |page=356 |title=Visual Perception: Physiology, Psychology, and Ecology }}</ref><ref>{{Google books |id=-QIfF9q6Q_EC |page=407 |title=Exercise Psychology }}</ref><ref>{{Google books |id=oUNfSjS11ggC |page=83 |title=Foundations of Perception }}</ref><ref>{{Google books |id=w888Mw1dh_EC |page=304 |title=Fitting The Task To The Human }}</ref>\n\nDecibels are still the commonly used units to express ratios in a number of fields, even when the original meaning of the term is obscured. Decibels are the traditional way of expressing gain or margin in such diverse disciplines as control theory, antenna and radio frequency transmission theory, and even assessment of nuclear hardness.{{dubious|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Criticism===\nVarious published articles have criticized the unit decibel as having shortcomings that hinder its understanding and use:<ref>C W Horton,\n[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6438830 \"The bewildering decibel\"] ''Elec.

Hickling concludes \"Decibels are a useless affectation, which is impeding the development of noise control as an engineering discipline\".<ref name=Hickling/>\n\nA common source of confusion in using the decibel occurs when deciding about the use of 10&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;log or 20&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;log.  In the original definition, it was a power measurement, and as employed in that context, the formulation 10&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;log should be used, as ''deci'' means one tenth. The user must be clear whether the quantity expressed is power or amplitude. It is useful to consider how power or energy is expressed, e.g., current&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;current&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;resistance, {{1/2}}&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;velocity&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;velocity&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;mass.  Where the power is a square function of a field variable (such as voltage, current, or pressure), then 10&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;log is the correct expression for the square, or 20&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;log for the field variable itself.\n\nQuantities in decibels are not necessarily [[Dimensional homogeneity|additive]],<ref>Nicholas P.

(...) Compare the logarithmic and arithmetic averages of ... 70&nbsp;dB and 90&nbsp;dB: [[logarithmic average]] = 87&nbsp;dB; [[arithmetic average]] = 80&nbsp;dB.\"\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Acoustics===\nThe decibel is commonly used in [[acoustics]] as a unit of [[sound pressure level]]. The reference pressure for sound in air is set at the typical threshold of perception of an average human and there are [[Sound pressure#Examples of sound pressure|common comparisons used to illustrate different levels of sound pressure]]. Sound pressure is a field quantity, therefore the field version of the unit definition is used:\n:<math>\nL_p = 20 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{rms}}}{p_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)\\!~\\mathrm{dB},\n</math>\nwhere ''p''<sub>ref</sub> is the standard reference sound pressure of 20 [[micropascal]]s in air<ref name=\"ElectronicEngineerrsHandbook\">\"Electronic Engineer's Handbook\" by Donald G. Fink, Editor-in-Chief  ISBN 0-07-020980-4 Published by McGraw Hill, page 19-3</ref> or 1 micropascal in water.\n\nThe human ear has a large [[dynamic range]] in sound reception. The ratio of the sound intensity that causes permanent damage during short exposure to that of the quietest sound that the ear can hear is greater than or equal to 1 trillion (10<sup>12</sup>).<ref>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communications Disorders, [http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/noise.asp ''Noise-Induced Hearing Loss''] (National Institutes of Health, 2008).</ref> Such large measurement ranges are conveniently expressed in [[logarithmic scale]]: the base-10 logarithm of 10<sup>12</sup> is 12, which is expressed as a sound pressure level of 120&nbsp;dB re 20&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|\u03bcPa]].\n\nSince the human ear is not equally sensitive to all sound frequencies, noise levels at maximum human sensitivity, somewhere between 2 and 4&nbsp;[[hertz|kHz]], are factored more heavily into some measurements using [[frequency weighting]]. (See also [[Stevens' power law]].)\n\n{{further information|Sound pressure#Examples of sound pressure}}\n\n===Electronics===\nIn electronics, the decibel is often used to express power or amplitude ratios ([[Gain (electronics)|gains]]), in preference to [[arithmetic]] ratios or [[percent]]ages. One advantage is that the total decibel gain of a series of components (such as [[amplifier]]s and [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuators]]) can be calculated simply by summing the decibel gains of the individual components. Similarly, in telecommunications, decibels denote signal gain or loss from a transmitter to a receiver through some medium ([[free space optical communication|free space]], [[waveguide]], [[coaxial cable]], [[fiber optics]], etc.) using a [[link budget]].\n\nThe decibel unit can also be combined with a suffix to create an absolute unit of electric power. For example, it can be combined with \"m\" for \"milliwatt\" to produce the \"[[dBm]]\".  Zero dBm is the level corresponding to one milliwatt, and 1 dBm is one decibel greater (about 1.259&nbsp;mW).\n\nIn professional audio specifications, a popular unit is the [[dBu]].  The [[dBu]] is a [[root mean square]] (RMS) measurement of voltage that uses as its reference approximately 0.775&nbsp;V<sub>RMS</sub>.  Chosen for historical reasons, the reference value is the voltage level which delivers 1&nbsp;mW of power in a 600-ohm resistor, which used to be the standard reference impedance in telephone circuits.\n\n===Optics===\nIn an [[optical link]], if a known amount of [[Optics|optical]] power, in [[dBm]] (referenced to 1&nbsp;mW), is launched into a [[Optical fiber|fiber]], and the losses, in dB (decibels), of each component (e.g., connectors, splices, and lengths of fiber) are known, the overall link loss may be quickly calculated by addition and subtraction of decibel quantities.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = Fiber optic installer's field manual\n | author = Bob Chomycz\n | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional\n | year = 2000\n | isbn = 978-0-07-135604-6\n | pages = 123\u2013126\n | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=B810SYIAa4IC |page=123 }}\n }}</ref>\n\nIn spectrometry and optics, the [[absorbance|blocking unit]] used to measure [[optical density]] is equivalent to \u22121 B.\n\n===Video and digital imaging===\nIn connection with video and digital [[image sensor]]s, decibels generally represent ratios of video voltages or digitized light levels, using 20 log of the ratio, even when the represented optical power is directly proportional to the voltage or level, not to its square, as in a [[CCD imager]] where response voltage is linear in intensity.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n | title = The Colour Image Processing Handbook\n | author = Stephen J.

Most commonly, quantities called \"dynamic range\" or \"signal-to-noise\" (of the camera) would be specified in 20 log dB, but in related contexts (e.g. attenuation, gain, intensifier SNR, or rejection ratio) the term should be interpreted cautiously, as confusion of the two units can result in very large misunderstandings of the value.\n\nPhotographers typically use an alternative base-2 log unit, the [[F-number#Stops.2C f-stop conventions.2C and exposure|stop]], to describe light intensity ratios or dynamic range.\n\n==Suffixes and reference values{{anchor|Suffixes}}==\nSuffixes are commonly attached to the basic dB unit in order to indicate the reference value by which the ratio is calculated. For example, dBm indicates power measurement relative to 1 milliwatt.\n\nIn cases where the unit value of the reference is stated, the decibel value is known as \"absolute\". If the unit value of the reference is not explicitly stated, as in the dB gain of an amplifier, then the decibel value is considered relative.\n\nThe SI does not permit attaching qualifiers to units, whether as suffix or prefix, other than standard [[SI prefix]]es.  Therefore, even though the decibel is accepted for use alongside [[SI units]], the practice of attaching a suffix to the basic dB unit, forming compound units such as dBm, dBu, dBA, etc., is not.<ref name=NIST2008>Thompson, A. and Taylor, B. N. sec 8.7, \"Logarithmic quantities and units: level, neper, bel\", ''Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI) 2008 Edition'', NIST Special Publication 811, 2nd printing (November 2008), SP811 [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf PDF]</ref> The proper way, according to the [[IEC 60027-3]],<ref name=IEC60027-3/> is either as ''L''<sub>''x''</sub> (re ''x''<sub>ref</sub>) or as ''L''<sub>''x''/''x''<sub>ref</sub></sub>, where ''x'' is the quantity symbol and ''x''<sub>ref</sub> is the value of the reference quantity, e.g., ''L''<sub>''E''</sub> (re  1 \u03bcV/m) = ''L''<sub>''E''/(1 \u03bcV/m)</sub> for the [[electric field strength]] ''E'' relative to 1 \u03bcV/m reference value.\n\nOutside of documents adhering to SI units, the practice is very common as illustrated by the following examples. There is no general rule, with various discipline-specific practices. Sometimes the suffix is a unit symbol (\"W\",\"K\",\"m\"), sometimes it is a transliteration of a unit symbol (\"uV\" instead of \u03bcV for microvolt), sometimes it is an acronym for the unit's name (\"sm\" for square meter, \"m\" for milliwatt), other times it is a mnemonic for the type of quantity being calculated (\"i\" for antenna gain with respect to an isotropic antenna, \"\u03bb\" for anything normalized by the EM wavelength), or otherwise a general attribute or identifier about the nature of the quantity (\"A\" for [[A-weighting|A-weighted]] sound pressure level). The suffix is often connected with a dash (dB-Hz), with a space (dB HL), with no intervening character (dBm), or enclosed in parentheses, dB(sm).\n\n===Voltage===\nSince the decibel is defined with respect to power, not amplitude, conversions of voltage ratios to decibels must square the amplitude, or use the factor of 20 instead of 10, as discussed above.\n\n[[File:Relationship between dBu and dBm.png|thumb|300px|A schematic showing the relationship between [[dBu]] (the [[voltage source]]) and [[dBm]] (the power dissipated as [[heat]] by the 600 \u03a9 [[resistor]])]]\n\n;dBV: dB(V<sub>[[root mean square|RMS]]</sub>) \u2013 [[volt]]age relative to 1 volt, regardless of impedance.<ref name = \"clqgmk\">{{citation |url=http://designtools.analog.com/dt/dbconvert/dbconvert.html |publisher=Analog Devices |title=Utilities : V<sub>RMS</sub> / dBm / dBu / dBV calculator |access-date=2016-09-16}}</ref>\n\n;dBu or dBv: [[root mean square|RMS]] [[volt]]age relative to {{nowrap|<math>\\sqrt{0.6}\\,\\mathrm V\\, \\approx 0.7746\\,\\mathrm V\\, \\approx -2.218\\,\\mathrm{dBV}</math>.<ref name = \"clqgmk\"/>}} Originally dBv, it was changed to dBu to avoid confusion with dBV.<ref>[http://stason.org/TULARC/entertainment/audio/pro/3-3-What-is-the-difference-between-dBv-dBu-dBV-dBm-dB.html What is the difference between dBv, dBu, dBV, dBm, dB SPL, and plain old dB?
