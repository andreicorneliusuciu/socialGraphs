In [[photometry (optics)|photometry]], this is used as a measure of the intensity, as perceived by the human eye, of [[light]] that hits or passes through a surface. It is analogous to the [[radiometry|radiometric]] unit watts per square metre, but with the power at each [[wavelength]] weighted according to the [[luminosity function]], a standardized model of [[human]] visual brightness perception. In English, \"lux\" is used in both singular and plural form.<ref>[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec09.html NIST Guide to SI Units - 9 Rules and Style Conventions for Spelling Unit Names], National Institute of Standards and Technology</ref>\n\n==Explanation==\n\n===Illuminance===\n\nIlluminance is a measure of how much [[luminous flux]] is spread over a given area. One can think of luminous flux (measured in [[lumen (unit)|lumens]]) as a measure of the total \"amount\" of visible light present, and the illuminance as a measure of the intensity of illumination on a surface. A given amount of light will illuminate a surface more dimly if it is spread over a larger area, so illuminance (lux) is inversely proportional to area when the luminous flux (lumens) is held constant.\n\nOne lux is equal to one lumen per [[square metre]]:\n:1&nbsp;lx&nbsp;= 1&nbsp;lm/m<sup>2</sup> = 1&nbsp;[[Candela|cd]]\u00b7[[Steradian|sr]]/m<sup>2</sup>\n\nA flux of 1000&nbsp;lumens, concentrated into an area of one square metre, lights up that square metre with an illuminance of 1000&nbsp;lux. However, the same 1000&nbsp;lumens, spread out over ten square metres, produces a dimmer illuminance of only 100&nbsp;lux.\n\nAchieving an illuminance of 500&nbsp;lux might be possible in a home kitchen with a single [[fluorescent light]] fixture with an output of {{val|12000|u=lumens}}. To light a factory floor with dozens of times the area of the kitchen would require dozens of such fixtures. Thus, lighting a larger area to the same level of lux requires a greater number of lumens.\n\nAs with other SI units, [[SI prefixes]] can be used, for example a kilolux (klx) is 1000&nbsp;lux.\n\nHere are some examples of the illuminance provided under various conditions:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|-\n| '''Illuminance (lux)''' || '''Surfaces illuminated by'''\n|-\n|0.0001||Moonless, overcast night sky ([[star#Radiation|starlight]])<ref name=\"radfaq\">{{cite web|title=Radiometry and photometry in astronomy|url=http://stjarnhimlen.se/comp/radfaq.html#10|first=Paul|last=Schlyter|year=1997\u20132009}}</ref>\n|-\n|0.002||Moonless clear night sky with [[airglow]]<ref name=radfaq/>\n|-\n|0.27\u20131.0||Full moon on a clear night<ref name=radfaq/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bunning |first1=Erwin |last2=Moser |first2=Ilse |date=April 1969 |title=Interference of moonlight with the photoperiodic measurement of time by plants, and their adaptive reaction |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=1018\u20131022 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/62/4/1018 |doi=10.1073/pnas.62.4.1018 |accessdate=2006-11-10 |pmid=16591742 |pmc=223607 |bibcode = 1969PNAS...62.1018B }}</ref>\n|-\n|3.4|| Dark limit of civil [[twilight]] under a clear sky<ref>{{cite web |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.383.144&rep=rep1&type=pdf |title=Electro-Optics Handbook |format=pdf |work=photonis.com |page=63 |accessdate=2012-04-02}}</ref>\n|-\n|20\u201350||Public areas with dark surroundings<ref name=\"NOAO_CaRLLI\">{{cite web |url=https://www.noao.edu/education/QLTkit/ACTIVITY_Documents/Safety/LightLevels_outdoor+indoor.pdf |title=NOAO Commen and Recommended Light Levels Indoor}}</ref>\n|-\n|50||Family living room lights (Australia, 1998)<ref name=\"energyrating\">{{Cite book|first=Alan |last=Pears |publisher=Department of Industry and Science, Commonwealth of Australia|work=Sustainable Solutions Pty Ltd|title=Strategic Study of Household Energy and Greenhouse Issues|date=June 1998|url=http://www.energyrating.com.au/library/pubs/pears-ago1998.pdf|chapter=Chapter 7: Appliance technologies and scope for emission reduction |page=61 |accessdate =2008-06-26| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110302110649/http://www.energyrating.gov.au/library/pubs/pears-ago1998.pdf|format=pdf| archivedate=2 March 2011|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n|-\n|80||Office building hallway/[[Toilet (room)|toilet]] lighting<ref>{{Cite book|author=Australian Greenhouse Office|title=Working Energy Resource and Training Kit: Lighting |date=May 2005|url=http://www.greenhouse.gov.au/lgmodules/wep/lights/index.html|chapter=Chapter 5: Assessing lighting savings |accessdate=2007-03-17 |postscript=<!--None-->| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070415151053/www.greenhouse.gov.au/lgmodules/wep/lights/training/training9.html | archivedate=2007-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scopecalc.com/ |title=Low-Light Performance Calculator}}</ref>\n|-\n|100||Very dark overcast day<ref name=radfaq/>\n|-\n|320\u2013500|| Office lighting<ref name=energyrating/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.resourcesmart.vic.gov.au/documents/lux_meter.pdf|format=pdf|title=How to use a lux meter (Australian recommendation)|publisher=Sustainability Victoria ([http://sustainability.vic.gov.au sustainability.vic.gov.au])|date=April 2010| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110707054658/http://www.resourcesmart.vic.gov.au/documents/lux_meter.pdf| archivedate=7 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=10630 |title=Illumination. - 1926.56 |work=Regulations (Standards - 29 CFR) |publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration, US Dept. of Labor| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090508051301/https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=10630| archivedate=8 May 2009}}</ref><ref>European law UNI EN 12464</ref>\n|-\n|400||[[Sunrise]] or [[sunset]] on a clear day.\n|-\n|1000||Overcast day;<ref name=radfaq/> typical [[TV studio]] lighting \n|-\n|10,000\u201325,000||Full [[daylight]] (not direct sun)<ref name=radfaq/>\n|-\n|32,000\u2013100,000||Direct [[sunlight]]\n|}\n\nThe illuminance provided by a light source, on a surface perpendicular to the direction to the source, is a measure of the strength of that source as perceived from that location. For instance, a star of [[apparent magnitude]] 0 provides 2.08 microlux at the earth's surface.<ref name=Schlyter7>[http://stjarnhimlen.se/comp/radfaq.html#7 Schlyter, Section 7]</ref> A barely perceptible magnitude 6 star provides 8 nanolux.<ref>[http://stjarnhimlen.se/comp/radfaq.html#14 Schlyter, Section 14.]</ref> The unobscured sun provides an illumination of up to 100&nbsp;kilolux on the Earth's surface, the exact value depending on time of year and atmospheric conditions. This direct normal illuminance is related to the [[solar illuminance constant]] ''E''<sub>sc</sub>, equal to {{val|128000|u=lux}} (see [[Sunlight]]).\n\nThe illumination provided on a surface by a point source equals the number of lux just described times the cosine of the angle between a ray coming from the source and a [[Surface normal|normal]] to the surface. The illumination provided by a light source that covers a large solid angle is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the surface normal and a sort of [[barycentre]] of the light source, so long as all of the source is above the plane of the surface. The number of lux falling on the surface equals this cosine times a number (in lux) that characterizes the source from the point of view in question.\n\n===Luminous emittance===\nThe lux is also a measure of [[luminous emittance]], the number of lumens given off by a surface per square metre, regardless of how that light is distributed in terms of the directions in which it is emitted. It differs from the [[luminance]] (measured in [[candela per square metre]] or \"[[Nit (unit)|nits]]\"), which does depend on the angular distribution of the emission. A perfectly white surface with one lux falling on it will emit one lux.\n\n===Relationship between illuminance and irradiance===\nLike all [[photometry (optics)|photometric units]], the lux has a corresponding \"[[radiometry|radiometric]]\" unit. The difference between any photometric unit and its corresponding radiometric unit is that radiometric units are based on physical power, with all wavelengths being weighted equally, while photometric units take into account the fact that the human eye's image-forming visual system is more sensitive to some wavelengths than others, and accordingly every wavelength is given a different weight. The weighting factor is known as the [[luminosity function]].\n\nThe lux is one lumen per square metre (lm/m<sup>2</sup>), and the corresponding radiometric unit, which measures [[irradiance]], is the watt per square metre (W/m<sup>2</sup>). There is no single conversion factor between lx and W/m<sup>2</sup>; there is a different conversion factor for every wavelength, and it is not possible to make a conversion unless one knows the spectral composition of the light.\n\nThe peak of the luminosity function is at 555&nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]] (green); the eye's image-forming visual system is more sensitive to light of this wavelength than any other. For monochromatic light ''of this wavelength'', the amount of illuminance for a given amount of irradiance is maximum: 683.002&nbsp;lux per W/m<sup>2</sup>; the irradiance needed to make one lux at this wavelength is about 1.464&nbsp;[[milliwatt|mW]]/m<sup>2</sup>. Other wavelengths of visible light produce fewer lux per watt-per-meter-squared. The luminosity function falls to zero for wavelengths outside the [[visible spectrum]].\n\nFor a light source with mixed wavelengths, the number of lumens per watt can be calculated by means of the luminosity function. In order to appear reasonably \"white,\" a light source cannot consist solely of the green light to which the eye's image-forming visual photoreceptors are most sensitive, but must include a generous mixture of red and blue wavelengths to which they are much less sensitive.\n\nThis means that white (or whitish) light sources produce far fewer lumens per watt than the theoretical maximum of 683.002&nbsp;lm/W. The ratio between the actual number of lumens per watt and the theoretical maximum is expressed as a percentage known as the [[luminous efficiency]].  For example, a typical [[incandescent light bulb]] has a luminous efficiency of only about 2%.\n\nIn reality, individual eyes vary slightly in their luminosity functions. However, photometric units are precisely defined and precisely measurable. They are based on an agreed-upon standard luminosity function which is based on measurements of the spectral characteristics of image-forming ''visual photoreception'' in many individual human eyes.\n\n==Use in video camera specifications==\n\nSpecifications for [[video camera]]s such as [[camcorder]]s and [[surveillance camera]]s often include a minimum illuminance level in lux at which the camera will record a satisfactory image.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}  A camera with good low-light capability will have a lower lux rating. [[Still camera]]s do not use such a specification, since longer [[exposure time]]s can generally be used to make pictures at very low illuminance levels, as opposed to the case in video cameras where a maximum exposure time is generally set by the [[frame rate]].\n\n=={{Anchor|Lux versus footcandle}}Non-SI units of illuminance==\nThe corresponding unit in English and American traditional units is the [[foot-candle]]. One foot candle is about 10.764 lux. Since one foot-candle is the illuminance cast on a surface by a one-candela source one foot away, a lux could be thought of as a \"metre-candle\", although this term is discouraged because it does not conform to SI standards for unit names.\n\nOne [[phot]]&nbsp;(ph) equals 10 kilolux.\n\nOne nox&nbsp;(nx) equals 1 millilux.\n\nIn [[astronomy]], [[apparent magnitude]] is a measure of the illuminance of a star on the Earth's atmosphere. A star with apparent magnitude 0 is 2.54 microlux outside the earth's atmosphere, and 82% of that (2.08 microlux) under clear skies.<ref name=Schlyter7/> A magnitude 6 star (just barely visible under good conditions) would be 8.3 nanolux. A standard candle (one candela) a kilometre away would provide an illuminance of 1 microlux\u2014about the same as a magnitude 1 star.\n\n==Legacy Unicode symbol==\n[[Unicode]] has a symbol for \"lx\": (\u33d3). It is a legacy code to accommodate old [[code page]]s in some [[Asia]]n languages. Use of this code is not recommended.\n\n==SI photometry units==\n{{SI_light_units}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Exposure value]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://fp.optics.arizona.edu/Palmer/rpfaq/rpfaq.htm Radiometry and photometry FAQ] Professor Jim Palmer's Radiometry FAQ page ([[University of Arizona]]).\n\n{{SI units}}\n{{Portal bar|Physics|Energy}}\n\n[[Category:SI derived units]]\n[[Category:Units of illuminance]]\n[[Category:Photometry]]"}]}}}}
