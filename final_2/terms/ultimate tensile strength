The maximum stress it withstands before fracturing is its '''ultimate tensile strength'''. ]]\n\n'''Ultimate tensile strength''' ('''UTS'''), often shortened to '''tensile strength''' ('''TS''') or '''ultimate strength''',<ref>{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=31}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|p=223}}</ref> is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to elongate, as opposed to [[compressive strength]], which withstands loads tending to reduce size. In other words, tensile strength resists [[tension (physics)|tension]] (being pulled apart), whereas compressive strength resists [[compression (physics)|compression]] (being pushed together). Ultimate tensile strength is measured by the maximum [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] that a material can withstand while being stretched or pulled before breaking. In the study of [[strength of materials]], tensile strength, compressive strength, and [[shear strength]] can be analyzed independently.\n\nSome materials break very sharply, without [[Plastic deformation#Plastic deformation|plastic deformation]], in what is called a [[brittle failure]].  Others, which are more [[ductile]], including most metals, experience some plastic deformation and possibly [[necking (engineering)|necking]] before fracture.\n\nThe UTS is usually found by performing a [[tensile test]] and recording the [[Stress\u2013strain analysis#Uniaxial stress|engineering stress]] versus [[strain (engineering)|strain]]. The highest point of the [[stress\u2013strain curve]] (see point 1 on the engineering stress/strain diagrams below) is the UTS. It is an [[intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]]; therefore its value does not depend on the size of the test specimen. However, it is dependent on other factors, such as the preparation of the specimen, the presence or otherwise of surface defects, and the temperature of the test environment and material.\n\nTensile strengths are rarely used in the design of [[ductile]] members, but they are important in brittle members. They are tabulated for common materials such as [[alloy]]s, [[composite material]]s, [[ceramic]]s, [[plastic]]s, and [[wood]].\n\nTensile strength can be defined  for [[liquid]]s as well as solids under certain conditions.  For example, when a [[tree]] <ref>For a review, see Harvey Brown \"The theory of the rise of sap in Trees: Some Historical and Conceptual Remarks\" in Physics in Perspective vol 15 (2013) p 320-358</ref> draws water from its roots to its upper leaves by [[transpiration]], the column of water is pulled upwards from the top by the cohesion of the water in the  xylem, and this force is transmitted down the column by its tensile strength.  Air pressure, osmotic pressure, and capillary tension also plays a small part in a tree's ability to draw up water, but this alone would only be sufficient to push the column of water to a height of less than ten metres, and trees can grow much higher than that (over 100&nbsp;m).\n\nTensile strength is defined as a stress, which is measured as [[force]] per unit [[area]]. For some non-homogeneous materials (or for assembled components) it can be reported just as a force or as a force per unit width. In the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the unit is the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa) (or a multiple thereof, often megapascals (MPa), using the [[Metric prefix|SI prefix]] ''mega''); or, equivalently to pascals, [[newton (unit)|newton]]s per square metre (N/m\u00b2). A [[United States customary unit]] is [[pounds per square inch]] (lb/in\u00b2 or psi), or kilo-pounds per square inch (ksi, or sometimes kpsi), which is equal to 1000 psi; kilo-pounds per square inch are commonly used in one country (USA), when measuring tensile strengths.\n\n==Concept==\n\n===Ductile materials===\n[[File:Stress v strain Aluminum 2.png|thumb|left|\"Engineering\" stress\u2013strain (\u03c3\u2013\u03b5) curve typical of aluminum<br>\n1.

Offset strain (typically 0.2%)\n]]\n{{Stress v strain A36 2.svg |290px |caption=\"Engineering\" (red) and \"true\" (blue) [[stress\u2013strain curve]] typical of [[structural steel]].}}\n\nMany materials can display linear [[Elastic deformation|elastic behavior]], defined by a linear [[stress\u2013strain relationship]], as shown in the left figure up to point 3. The elastic behavior of materials often extends into a non-linear region, represented in the figure by point 2 (the \"yield point\"), up to which [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]]s are completely recoverable upon removal of the load; that is, a specimen loaded elastically in [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] will elongate, but will return to its original shape and size when unloaded. Beyond this elastic region, for [[ductile]] materials, such as steel, deformations are [[plastic deformation|plastic]]. A plastically deformed specimen does not completely return to its original size and shape when unloaded. For many applications, plastic deformation is unacceptable, and is used as the design limitation.\n\nAfter the yield point, ductile metals undergo a period of strain hardening, in which the stress increases again with increasing strain, and they begin to [[necking (engineering)|neck]], as the cross-sectional area of the specimen decreases due to plastic flow. In a sufficiently ductile material, when necking becomes substantial, it causes a reversal of the engineering stress\u2013strain curve (curve A, right figure); this is because the ''engineering stress'' is calculated assuming the original cross-sectional area before necking. The reversal point is the maximum stress on the engineering stress\u2013strain curve, and the engineering stress coordinate of this point is the ultimate tensile strength, given by point 1.\n\nThe UTS is not used in the design of ductile [[Statics|static]] members because design practices dictate the use of the [[yield stress]]. It is, however, used for quality control, because of the ease of testing. It is also used to roughly determine material types for unknown samples.<ref name=\"ndt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ndt-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Materials/Mechanical/Tensile.htm|title=Tensile Properties|publisher=|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe UTS is a common engineering parameter when designing brittle members, because there is no [[yield point]].<ref name=\"ndt\"/>\n\n==Testing==\n[[File:Al tensile test.jpg|thumb|Round bar specimen after tensile stress testing]]\n{{main|Tensile testing}}\n\nTypically, the testing involves taking a small sample with a fixed cross-sectional area, and then pulling it with a [[tensometer]] at a constant strain (change in gauge length divided by initial gauge length) rate until the sample breaks.\n\nWhen testing some metals, [[indentation hardness]] correlates linearly with tensile strength. This important relation permits economically important nondestructive testing of bulk metal deliveries with lightweight, even portable equipment, such as hand-held [[Rockwell hardness]] testers.<ref>E.J. Pavlina and C.J. Van Tyne, \"[http://www.springerlink.com/content/q86642448t84g267/ Correlation of Yield Strength and Tensile Strength with Hardness for Steels]\", ''[[Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance]]'', 17:6 (December 2008)</ref> This practical correlation helps [[quality assurance]] in metalworking industries to extend well beyond the laboratory and [[universal testing machine]]s. \n\nIt should be noted that, while most metal forms, such as sheet, bar, tube, and wire, can exhibit the test UTS, fibers, such as carbon fibers, being only 2/10,000th of an inch in diameter, must be made into composites to create useful real-world forms. As the datasheet on T1000G below indicates, while the UTS of the fiber is very high at 6,370&nbsp;MPa, the UTS of a derived composite is 3,040&nbsp;MPa - less than half the strength of the fiber.<ref name=\"tubeshop\"/>\n\n==Typical tensile strengths==\n\n{| class = \"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Typical tensile strengths of some materials\n|-\n!
