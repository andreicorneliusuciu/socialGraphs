It also requires a relatively sophisticated controller, often a dedicated module designed specifically for use with servomotors.\n\nServomotors are not a specific class of motor although the term ''servomotor ''is often used to refer to a motor suitable for use in a closed-loop control system.\n\nServomotors are used in applications such as [[robotics]], [[CNC]] machinery or automated manufacturing.\n\n== Mechanism ==\nA servomotor is a  [[closed-loop controller|closed-loop]] [[servomechanism]] that uses position feedback to control its motion and final position. The input to its control is a signal, either analogue or digital, representing the position commanded for the output shaft.\n\nThe motor is paired with some type of [[encoder]] to provide position and speed feedback. In the simplest case, only the position is measured. The measured position of the output is compared to the command position, the external input to the controller. If the output position differs from that required, an [[error signal]] is generated which then causes the motor to rotate in either direction, as needed to bring the output shaft to the appropriate position. As the positions approach, the error signal reduces to zero and the motor stops.\n\nThe very simplest servomotors use position-only sensing via a [[potentiometer]] and [[bang-bang control]] of their motor; the motor always rotates at full speed (or is stopped). This type of servomotor is not widely used in industrial [[motion control]], but it forms the basis of the simple and cheap [[servo (radio control)|servo]]s used for [[radio-controlled model]]s.\n\nMore sophisticated servomotors use optical [[Rotary encoder|rotary encoders]] to measure the speed of the output shaft<ref name=\"SuhKang2008\">{{cite book|author1=Suk-Hwan Suh|author2=Seong Kyoon Kang|author3=Dae-Hyuk Chung|coauthors=Ian Stroud|title=Theory and Design of CNC Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c_-3TxZlnpMC&pg=PA11|date=22 August 2008|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-84800-336-1|pages=11\u2013}}</ref> and a variable-speed drive to control the motor speed.<ref name=\"Gieras2011\">{{cite book|author=Jacek F.

[[Stepper motor|Stepper motors]] continue to consume power to lock in and hold the commanded position.\n\nServomotors are generally used as a high-performance alternative to the stepper motor. Stepper motors have some inherent ability to control position, as they have built-in output steps. This often allows them to be used as an open-loop position control, without any feedback encoder, as their drive signal specifies the number of steps of movement to rotate, but for this the controller needs to 'know' the position of the stepper motor on power up. Therefore, on first power up, the controller will have to activate the stepper motor and turn it to a known position, e.g. until it activates an end limit switch. This can be observed when switching on an [[Inkjet printing|inkjet printer]]; the controller will move the ink jet carrier to the extreme left and right to establish the end positions. A servomotor will immediately turn to whatever angle the controller instructs it to, regardless of the initial position at power up.\n\nThe lack of feedback of a stepper motor limits its performance, as the stepper motor can only drive a load that is well within its capacity, otherwise missed steps under load may lead to positioning errors and the system may have to be restarted or recalibrated. The encoder and controller of a servomotor are an additional cost, but they optimise the performance of the overall system (for all of speed, power and accuracy) relative to the capacity of the basic motor. With larger systems, where a powerful motor represents an increasing proportion of the system cost, servomotors have the advantage.\n\nThere has been increasing popularity in closed loop [[stepper motor]]s in recent years. They act like servomotors but have some differences in their software control to get smooth motion. The top 3 manufacturers of closed loop stepper motor systems employ magnetic encoders as their feedback device of choice due to low cost and resistance to vibration. The main benefit of a closed loop stepper motor is the cost to performance ratio. There is also no need to tune the [[PID controller]] on a closed loop stepper system.<ref>{{Cite web\n  |title= Fastech Closed Loop Stepper Motors\n  |url=http://www.fastech.co.kr/bbs/eng/motor.php\n  |publisher=Fastech Korea\n}}</ref>\n\nMany applications, such as [[laser cutting]] machines, may be offered in two ranges, the low-priced range using stepper motors and the high-performance range using servomotors.<ref >{{Cite web\n  |title= Legend Elite laser series\n  |url=http://www.epiloglaser.com/legend_series.htm\n  |publisher=Epilog Laser\n  |quote=Servo motors are incorporated in both the X and Y axes of every Legend Elite Series laser. These motors are known for their fast acceleration and deceleration speeds.\n}}</ref>\n\n== Encoders ==\nThe first servomotors were developed with [[synchro]]s as their encoders.<ref>{{Cite book\n  |title=Synchro Engineering Handbook\n  |last=Upson  |first=A.R.\n  |last2=Batchelor  |first2=J.H.\n  |publisher=Muirhead Vactric Components  |location=Beckenham\n  |origyear=1965\n  |year=1978\n  |pages=7, 67\u201390\n}}</ref> Much work was done with these systems in the development of [[radar]] and [[anti-aircraft artillery]] during [[World War II]]. <ref>[http://www.eugeneleeslover.com/USNAVY/CHAPTER-10-D.html \"Naval Ordnance and Gunnery, Volume 1\", 1957, U.S. Navy Manual, Chapter 10.]</ref>\n\nSimple servomotors may use resistive potentiometers as their position encoder. These are only used at the very simplest and cheapest level, and are in close competition with stepper motors. They suffer from wear and electrical noise in the potentiometer track. Although it would be possible to [[differentiator|electrically differentiate]] their position signal to obtain a speed signal, [[PID controller]]s that can make use of such a speed signal generally warrant a more precise encoder.\n\nModern servomotors use [[rotary encoder]]s, either [[absolute encoder|absolute]] or [[incremental encoder|incremental]]. Absolute encoders can determine their position at power-on, but are more complicated and expensive. Incremental encoders are simpler, cheaper and work at faster speeds. Incremental systems, like stepper motors, often combine their inherent ability to measure intervals of rotation with a simple zero-position sensor to set their position at start-up.\n\nInstead of servomotors, sometimes a motor with a separate, external linear encoder is used.<ref>{{Cite web\n  |title= Accupoint\u2122 Linear Encoders\n  |url=http://www.epiloglaser.com/legend_linearencoders.htm\n  |publisher=Epilog Laser\n}}</ref> These motor + linear encoder systems avoid inaccuracies in the drivetrain between the motor and linear carriage, but their design is made more complicated as they are no longer a pre-packaged factory-made system.\n\n== Motors ==\nThe type of motor is not critical to a servomotor and different types may be used. At the simplest, brushed permanent magnet DC motors are used, owing to their simplicity and low cost. Small industrial servomotors are typically electronically commutated brushless motors.<ref>{{Cite web\n  |title=Brushless DC motor cores for servomotors\n  |url=http://www.maxonmotor.co.uk/maxon/view/product/motor/ecmotor/ecmax/ecmax40/283869\n  |publisher=Maxon Motor\n}}</ref> For large industrial servomotors, AC induction motors are typically used, often with [[variable frequency drive]]s to allow control of their speed. For ultimate performance in a compact package, brushless AC motors with permanent magnet fields are used, effectively large versions of [[Brushless DC electric motor]]s.<ref>{{Cite web\n  |title=Compact Dynamic Brushless Servo Motor\n  |url=http://www.moog.com/products/motors-servomotors/servo-motors/\n  |publisher=[[Moog Inc]]\n}}</ref>\n\nDrive modules for servomotors are a standard industrial component. Their design is a branch of [[power electronics]], usually based on a three-phase MOSFET or IGBT [[H bridge]]. These standard modules accept a single direction and pulse count (rotation distance) as input. They may also include over-temperature monitoring, over-torque and stall detection features.<ref>{{Cite web\n  |title=Brushless PWM Servo Amplifiers\n  |url=http://www.a-m-c.com/download/datasheet/zbdc6a6.pdf\n  |publisher=Advanced Motion Control\n}}</ref> As the encoder type, gearhead ratio and overall system dynamics are application specific, it is more difficult to produce the overall controller as an off-the-shelf module and so these are often implemented as part of the main controller.\n\n== Control ==\nMost modern servomotors are designed and supplied around a dedicated controller module from the same manufacturer. Controllers may also be developed around [[microcontroller]]s in order to reduce cost for large-volume applications.{{cn|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Integrated servomotors==\nIntegrated servomotors are designed so as to include the motor, driver, encoder and associated electronics into a single package.<ref name=\"Denket2006\">{{cite book|author=Max A.
