Founded as an engineering society focused on [[mechanical engineering]] in North America, ASME is today multidisciplinary and global.\n\nASME has over 140,000 members in 158 countries worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=About ASME \u2013 At a Glance|url=http://www.asme.org/about-asme|publisher=ASME|accessdate=7 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nASME was founded in 1880 by [[Alexander Lyman Holley]], [[Henry Rossiter Worthington]], [[John Edison Sweet]] and [[Matthias N.

It produces approximately 600 codes and standards covering many technical areas, such as fasteners, plumbing fixtures, elevators, pipelines, and power plant systems and components.  ASME's standards are developed by committees of subject matter experts using an open, consensus-based process.  Many ASME standards are cited by government agencies as tools to meet their regulatory objectives.  ASME standards are therefore voluntary, unless the standards have been incorporated into a legally binding business contract or incorporated into regulations enforced by an authority having jurisdiction, such as a federal, state, or local government agency.  ASME's standards are used in more than 100 countries and have been translated into numerous languages.<ref>{{cite web|title=Standards Are Global|url=http://www.asme.org/kb/standards/history-of-asme-standards|work=History of ASME Standards|publisher=ASME|accessdate=7 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===ASME boiler and pressure vessel code (BPVC)===\n{{main article|ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC)}}\nThe largest ASME standard, both in size and in the number of volunteers involved in its preparation, is the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC). The BPVC provides rules for the design, fabrication, installation, inspection, care, and use of [[boiler]]s, [[pressure vessel]]s, and nuclear components. The code also includes standards on materials, welding and brazing procedures and qualifications, nondestructive examination, and nuclear in-service inspection.\n\n===Other notable standardization areas===\n\nOther Notable Standardization Areas includes but not limited to are; Elevators and Escalators (A17 Series),\nPiping and Pipelines (B31 Series), Bioprocessing Equipment (BPE), Valves Flanges, Fittings and Gaskets (B16),\nNuclear Components and Processes Performance Test Codes.\n\n==Notable members==\nThe following people are, or were, notable members of ASME:{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n* Dennis Assanis\n* [[Charles Brinckerhoff Richards]] (1833\u20131919) Founder, manager from 1881\u201382, Vice-president from 1888\u201390 <ref>{{cite book|title= A history of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers from 1880 to 1915 |editor =Frederick Remsen Hutton |publisher= The Society|year=1915 |page=16}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title= Machinery |publisher= The Industrial Press|year=1908 |page=826|quote=Richards was one of the founders of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1881}}</ref>\n* [[Alexander T.
