In municipalities (countries) which have a well developed waste recycling system, the waste stream consists mainly of intractable wastes such as plastic film, and unrecyclable packaging materials. At the start of the 20th century, the majority of domestic waste (53%) in the UK consisted of [[coal ash]] from open fires.<ref>[http://www.ciwm.co.uk/web/FILES/About_CIWM/100_yrs_London_and_SE_centre.pdf Centenary history of waste and waste managers in London and south east England- Page 7]</ref>\nIn developed municipalities (countries) without significant recycling activity it predominantly includes food wastes, market wastes, yard wastes, plastic containers and product packaging materials, and other miscellaneous solid wastes from residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial sources.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/ Non-hazardous Waste] U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Municipal Solid Waste</ref> Most definitions of municipal solid waste do not include [[industrial waste]]s, agricultural wastes, [[medical waste]], radioactive waste or [[sewage sludge]].<ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/solar.renewables/page/mswaste/msw.html Municipal Solid Waste] U.S. Energy Information Administration</ref> Waste collection is performed by the [[municipality]] within a given area. The term ''residual waste'' relates to waste left from household sources containing materials that have not been separated out or sent for reprocessing.<ref>[http://www.countryside.wales.gov.uk/fe/master.asp?n1=366&n2=213&n3=896 Mechanical Biological Treatment] Welsh Assembly (2005) Mechanical Biological Treatment, Environment Countryside and Planning Website, Welsh Assembly</ref> Waste can be classified in several ways but the following list represents a typical classification:\n\n*[[Biodegradable waste]]: [[food waste|food and kitchen waste]], [[green waste]], [[paper]] (most can be recycled although some difficult to compost plant material may be excluded <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccc.govt.nz/services/rubbish-and-recycling/sorting/organics-green-bin/|publisher=Christchurch City Council|title=Organics -Green Bin|access-date=19 March 2016}}</ref>)\n*[[Recycling|Recyclable]] materials: [[paper]], [[cardboard]], [[glass]], [[bottle]]s, [[jar]]s, [[tin can]]s, [[aluminum can]]s, [[aluminum foil]], [[metal]]s, certain [[plastic]]s, [[fabric]]s, [[clothes]], [[tire]]s, [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], etc.\n*[[Inert]] waste: [[construction and demolition waste]], [[soil|dirt]], [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s, [[debris]]\n*Electrical and [[electronic waste]] (WEEE) - [[home appliance|electrical appliance]]s, [[lamp (electrical component)|light bulb]]s, [[washing machine]]s, [[Television|TV]]s, [[computer]]s, screens, [[mobile phone]]s, [[alarm clock]]s, [[watch]]es, etc.\n*Composite wastes: waste [[clothing]], Tetra Packs, waste plastics such as toys\n*[[Hazardous waste]] including most [[paint]]s, [[chemical]]s, [[tire]]s, [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[light bulb]]s, electrical appliances, [[fluorescent lamp]]s, [[aerosol spray|aerosol spray cans]], and [[fertilizer]]s\n*[[Toxic waste]] including [[pesticide]]s, [[herbicide]]s, and [[fungicide]]s\n*[[Biomedical waste]], expired [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, etc.\n\n== Components of solid waste management ==\n[[File:Tri des d\u00e9chets (cropped).jpg|thumb|Bins to collect [[Paper recycling|paper]], [[Aluminium recycling|aluminium]], [[Glass recycling|glass]], [[PET bottle recycling|PET bottles]] and incinerable waste.]]\n\nThe municipal solid waste industry has four components: [[recycling]], [[compost]]ing, [[landfill|disposal]], and [[waste-to-energy]] via incineration.<ref>[http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/solar.renewables/page/mswaste/msw.html Nonhazardous waste] U.S. Energy Information Administration</ref> There is no single approach that can be applied to the management of all waste streams, therefore the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], federal agency of the [[United States of America]], developed a hierarchy ranking strategy for municipal solid waste.<ref>[https://sftool.gov/explore/green-building/section/57/solid-waste/system-overview System Overview]</ref> The [[Waste hierarchy|Waste Management Hierarchy]] is made up of four levels ordered from most preferred to least preferred methods based on their environmental soundness: Source reduction and reuse; recycling or composting; energy recovery; treatment and disposal.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/hierarchy.htm Advancing Sustainable Materials Management: Facts and Figures]</ref>\n\n=== Collection ===\nThe functional element of collection includes not only the gathering of solid waste and recyclable materials, but also the transport of these materials, after collection, to the location where the collection vehicle is emptied. This location may be a materials processing facility, a transfer station or a landfill disposal site.\n\n=== Waste handling and separation, storage and processing at the source ===\nWaste handling and separation involves activities associated with waste management until the waste is placed in storage containers for collection. Handling also encompasses the movement of loaded containers to the point of collection. Separating different types of waste components is an important step in the handling and storage of solid waste at the source.\n\n=== Segregation and processing and transformation of solid wastes ===\nThe types of means and facilities that are now used for the recovery of waste materials that have been separated at the source include curbside ('kerbside' in the UK) collection, drop-off and buy-back centers. The separation and processing of wastes that have been separated at the source and the separation of commingled wastes usually occur at a materials recovery facility, transfer stations, combustion facilities and disposal sites.\n\n=== Transfer and transport ===\nThis element involves two main steps. First, the waste is transferred from a smaller collection vehicle to larger transport equipment. The waste is then transported, usually over long distances, to a processing or disposal site.\n\n=== Disposal ===\n[[Image:Mixed municipal waste.JPG|right|thumbnail|200px|Mixed municipal waste, [[Hiriya]], [[Tel Aviv]] ]]\nToday, the disposal of wastes by land filling or land spreading is the ultimate fate of all solid wastes, whether they are residential wastes collected and transported directly to a landfill site, residual materials from [[materials recovery facilities]] (MRFs), residue from the combustion of solid waste, [[compost]], or other substances from various solid waste processing facilities. A modern sanitary landfill is not a dump; it is an engineered facility used for disposing of solid wastes on land without creating nuisances or hazards to public health or safety, such as the problems of insects and the contamination of [[ground water]].\n\n=== Reusing ===\nIn the recent years environmental organizations, such as [[Freegle]] or [[Freecycle Network]], have been gaining popularity for their online reuse networks. These networks provide a worldwide online registry of unwanted items that would otherwise be thrown away, for individuals and nonprofits to reuse or recycle. Therefore, this free Internet-based service reduces landfill pollution and promotes the [[gift economy]].\n\n===Landfills===\nLandfills are created by land dumping. Land dumping methods vary, most commonly it involves the mass dumping of waste into a designated area, usually a hole or sidehill. After the waste is dumped, it is then compacted by large machines. When the dumping cell is full, it is then \"sealed\" with a plastic sheet and covered in several feet of dirt. This is the primary method of dumping in the United States because of the low cost and abundance of unused land in North America. Landfills pose the threat of pollution, and can intoxicate ground water. The signs of pollution are effectively masked by disposal companies and it is often hard to see any evidence. Usually landfills are surrounded by large walls or fences hiding the mounds of debris. Large amounts of chemical odor eliminating agent are sprayed in the air surrounding landfills to hide the evidence of the rotting waste inside the plant.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rogers|first1=Heather|title=Gone Tomorrow: The Hidden Life of Garbage <!--all that follows appears to be spurious - book was not published by Bedford/St. Martins, is not dated 2015, does not have an ISBN anywhere close to this, looked at book preview and info in article is not included in book at those pages |date=12 March 2015|publisher=Bedford/St. Martins|isbn=978-0-312-6784-1|pages=188-190-->}}</ref>\n\n=== Energy generation ===\nMunicipal solid waste can be used to generate energy. Several technologies have been developed that make the processing of MSW for energy generation cleaner and more economical than ever before, including landfill gas capture, combustion, [[pyrolysis]], [[gasification]], and [[plasma arc gasification|plasma arc ''gasification'']].<ref>[http://www.eesi.org/files/eesi_msw_issuebrief_072109.pdf Environmental and Energy Study Institute Issue Brief]</ref> While older waste incineration plants emitted high levels of pollutants, recent regulatory changes and new technologies have significantly reduced this concern. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) regulations in 1995 and 2000 under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] have succeeded in reducing emissions of [[dioxins]] from [[waste-to-energy]] facilities by more than 99 percent below 1990 levels, while mercury emissions have been reduced by over 90 percent.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/ncer/publications/research_results_needs/combustionEmmissionsReport.pdf Combustion Emissions from Hazardous Waste Incinerators, Boilers and Industrial Furnaces, and Municipal Solid Waste Incinerators- Results from Five STAR Grants and Research Needs U.S. EPA]</ref> The EPA noted these improvements in 2003, citing waste-to-energy as a power source \"with less environmental impact than almost any other source of [[electricity]]\".<ref>[http://www.wte.org/userfiles/file/epaletter.pdf U.S. EPA Letter to Maria Zannes, President, Integrated Waste Services Association]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Garbology]] (study of modern refuse and trash)\n* [[List of waste management acronyms]]\n* [[MSW/LFG]] (municipal solid waste and [[landfill gas]])\n* [[Sewage]]\n\n==References==\n{{Refimprove|date=April 2011}}\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading== \n* {{Cite journal | last1 = Vergara | first1 = S.
