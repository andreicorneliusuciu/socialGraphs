It is intermediate between a [[three-stage-to-orbit]] launcher and a hypothetical [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) launcher.\n\nAt liftoff the first stage is responsible for accelerating the vehicle.  At some point the second stage detaches from the first stage and continues to orbit under its own power.\n\nAn advantage of such a system over single-stage-to-orbit is that the entire mass of the spacecraft is not carried into orbit. This reduces the cost involved in reaching orbital velocity as much of the structure and engine mass is ejected and a larger percentage of the orbited mass is payload mass.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nAn advantage over three or more stages is reduction in complexity and fewer [[separation event]]s, each of which reduces cost and risk of failure.<ref>{{cite web|title=Falcon 1 - Stage Separation Reliability|url=http://www.spacex.com/falcon1.php#engine_reliability|publisher=[[SpaceX]]|accessdate=8 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Examples of two stage to orbit systems==\n* [[Angara (rocket)|Angara]] 1.2\n* [[Atlas V]] (401 and 501)\n* ''[[Blue Origin orbital launch vehicle]] (proposed)''\n* [[Cosmos-3M]]\n* [[Delta IV]] (medium)\n* [[Falcon 1]]\n* [[Falcon 9]]\n* [[Saturn IB]]\n* [[Saturn V|Saturn V-SL1]] ([[Skylab]] launch)\n* [[Tsyklon-2]]\n* ''[[Vulcan (rocket)|Vulcan]] (proposed)''\n* [[Zenit-2]]\n\nIt is not always clear when a vehicle is a DSTO.  Many designs which use a very small boost at the beginning of their flight are referred to as single-stage-to-orbit.  Some have also coined the expression 1.5STO for 'one-and-a-half-stage-to-orbit', e.g., the [[Atlas (rocket)|Atlas]].  Also, many launch vehicles have side-mounted booster rockets which are jettisoned early which are called \"stage-0\".\n\n==Reusable launch systems==\n\nWith reference to a [[reusable launch system]] this approach is often proposed as an alternative to single-stage-to-orbit (or ''SSTO''). Its supporters argue that, since each stage may have a lower [[mass ratio]] than an SSTO launch system, such a system may be built without approaching as close to the limitations of its structural materials.  It therefore should require less maintenance, less testing, experience fewer failures and have a longer working life.\n\nCritics argue{{who|date=November 2010}} that the increased complexity of designing two separate stages that must interact, the logistics involved in returning the first stage to the launch site, and the difficulties of conducting incremental testing on a second stage will outweigh these benefits. In the case of airplane-like lower stages they also argue how difficult and expensive high speed aircraft (like the [[SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71]]) are to develop and operate, and question performance claims. Many 'mini-shuttle' designs that use transport aircraft as first stages also face similar problems with ice/foam as the [[Space Shuttle]] due to the requirement they also carry a large external tank for their fuel.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} [[SpaceX]] is the only launch provider which is currently [[SpaceX reusable launch system development program|attempting]] first-stage reuse of an orbital vehicle.\n\nOn the other hand, the two-stage approach allows the lower stage to be optimized for operation in the Earth's lower atmosphere, where pressure and drag are high, while the upper stage can be optimized for operation in the near-vacuum conditions of the later part of the launch. This allows an increase in the payload mass fraction of a two-stage vehicle over single-stage or stage-and-a-half vehicles, which have to perform in both environments using the same hardware.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n===Helicopter-like first stage===\nTaking the view that airplane like operations do not translate to airplane-like appearance, many TSTOs have first stages that operate as [[VTOL]] or [[VTOHL]] aircraft. The [[DC-X]] has proven the VTOL option design workable. Other designs like the [[DH-1 (rocket)|DH-1]] concept take it a step further and use a 'pop-up/pop-down' approach, which delivers the orbiting stage to a point about 60&nbsp;km above the earth's surface, before dropping down to the launch pad again. In the case of the DH-1, the upper stage is effectively an 'almost SSTO' with a more realistic mass fraction and which was optimised for reliability.\n\n===Airplane-like first stage===\n\nTSTO designs comprise an [[airplane]]-like first stage and a [[rocket]]-like second stage. The airplane elements can be wings, air-breathing engines, or both. This approach appeals because it transforms [[Earth's atmosphere]] from an obstacle into an advantage. Above a certain speed and altitude, wings and [[scramjet]]s cease being effective, and the rocket is deployed to complete the trip to orbit.\n\nWhile not an orbital vehicle, the successful private [[SpaceShipOne]] suborbital spacecraft developed for the [[Ansari X Prize]] demonstrated that the problems of integrating a two-stage system, with a winged aircraft as the \"lower half\", that can reach the [[edge of space]] are not insurmountable. {{As of|2005}}, the team behind SpaceShipOne had built and flown a commercial sub-orbital launch system -- [[SpaceShipTwo]]\u2014based on this technology.\n\nThe [[Pegasus rocket]] while airplane launched, is not a two-stage-to-orbit system because the rocket component itself is composed of multiple stages.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Two-Stage-To-Orbit}}\n[[Category:Spacecraft propulsion]]\n[[Category:Space launch vehicles]]\n[[Category:Single-stage-to-orbit]]"}]}}}}
