The hybrid rocket concept can be traced back at least 75 years.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/gird09.htm | title = GIRD-09 | publisher = Encyclopedia Astronautix | accessdate = 2009-04-24}}</ref>\n\nHybrid rockets avoid some of the disadvantages of [[solid rocket]]s like the dangers of propellant handling, while also avoiding some disadvantages of [[Liquid-fuel rocket|liquid rockets]] like their mechanical complexity.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.spg-corp.com/space-propulsion-group-resources.html | title = Hybrid Rocket Propulsion Overview | publisher = Space Propulsion Group, Inc.}}</ref> Because it is difficult for the fuel and oxidizer to be mixed intimately (being different states of matter), hybrid rockets tend to fail more benignly than liquids or solids. Like liquid rocket engines, hybrid rocket motors can be shut down easily and the thrust is throttleable. The theoretical [[specific impulse|specific impulse (<math>I_{sp}</math>)]] performance of hybrids is generally higher than solid motors and lower than liquid engines. <math>I_{sp}</math> as high as 400s has been measured in a hybrid rocket using metalized fuels.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.spg-corp.com/News_12.php | title = A Brief History of Hybrid Rocket Technology | publisher = Space Propulsion Group, Inc.}}</ref> Hybrid systems are more complex than solid ones, but they avoid [[PEPCON disaster|significant hazards]] of manufacturing, shipping and handling solid rocket motors by storing the oxidizer and the fuel separately.\n\n==Basic concepts==\n[[File:Hybrids big.png|thumb|300px|Hybrid rocket propulsion system conceptual overview]]\n\nIn its simplest form a hybrid rocket consists of a [[pressure vessel]] (tank) containing the liquid [[rocket propellant|propellant]], the [[combustion chamber]] containing the solid [[rocket propellant|propellant]], and a mechanical device separating the two. When thrust is desired, a suitable ignition source is introduced in the combustion chamber and the valve is opened. The liquid propellant (or gas) flows into the combustion chamber where it is vaporized and then reacted with the solid propellant. [[Combustion]] occurs in a [[boundary layer]] [[diffusion flame]] adjacent to the surface of the solid propellant.\n\nGenerally the liquid propellant is the [[oxidizer]] and the solid propellant is the [[fuel]] because solid oxidizers are extremely dangerous and [[rocket propellant#Advantages 2|lower performing]] than liquid oxidizers. Furthermore, using a solid fuel such as [[Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene]] (HTPB) or [[paraffin wax]] allows for the incorporation of high-energy fuel additives such as [[aluminium]], [[lithium]], or [[metal hydrides]].\n\nCommon oxidizers include gaseous or liquid [[oxygen]], [[nitrous oxide]], and hydrogen peroxide.\n\nCommon fuels include [[polymers]] such as [[polyethylene]], [[cross-link]]ed [[rubbers|rubber]] such as [[Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene|HTPB]] or liquefying fuels such as [[paraffin wax]].\n\n==Properties==\nHybrid rocket motors exhibit some obvious as well as some subtle advantages over [[liquid-fuel rocket]]s and [[solid-fuel rocket]]s. A brief summary of some of these is given below:\n\n===Advantages compared with liquid rockets===\n* Mechanically simpler - requires only a single liquid propellant resulting in less plumbing, fewer valves, and simpler operations.\n* Denser fuel - fuels in the solid [[phase (matter)|phase]] generally have higher density than those in the liquid phase, reducing overall system volume.\n* Metal additives - reactive metals such as aluminium, [[magnesium]], [[lithium]] or [[beryllium]] can be easily included in the fuel grain increasing [[specific impulse|specific impulse(<math>I_{sp}</math>)]], density, or both.\n* Combustion instabilities - Hybrid rockets do not typically exhibit high frequency combustion instabilities that plague liquid rockets due to the solid fuel grain breaking up acoustic waves that would otherwise reflect in an open liquid engine combustion chamber.  \n* Propellant pressurization - One of the most difficult to design portions of a liquid rocket system are the [[turbopumps]]. Turbopump design is complex as it has to precisely and efficiently pump and keep separated two fluids of different properties in precise ratios at very high volumetric flow rates, often cryogenic temperatures, and highly volatile chemicals while combusting those same fluids in order to power itself.  Hybrids have far less fluid to move and can often be pressurized by a blow-down system (which would be prohibitively heavy in a liquid rocket) or self-pressurized oxidizers (such as N<sub>2</sub>O).\n* Cooling - Liquid rockets often depend on one of the propellants, typically the fuel, to cool the combustion chamber and [[nozzle]] due to the very high heat fluxes and vulnerability of the metal walls to oxidation and stress cracking.  Hybrid rockets have combustion chamber that are lined with the solid propellant which shields it from the product gases.  Their nozzles are often graphite or coated in ablative materials similarly to solid rocket motors.  The design, construction, and testing of liquid cooling flows is complex, making the system more prone to failure.\n\n===Advantages compared with solid rockets===\n* Higher theoretical <math>I_{sp}</math> - Possible due to limits of known solid oxidizers compared to often used liquid oxidizers.\n* Less explosion hazard - Propellant grain is more tolerant of processing errors such as cracks since the burn rate is dependent on oxidizer mass flux rate.  Propellant grain cannot be ignited by stray electrical charge and is very insensitive to auto-igniting due to heat. Hybrid rocket motors can be transported to the launch site with the oxidizer and fuel stored separately, improving safety.\n* Fewer handling and storage issues - Ingredients in solid rockets are often incompatible chemically and thermally.  Repeated changes in temperature can cause distortion of the grain.  Antioxidants and coatings are used to keep the grain from breaking down or decomposing.\n* More controllable - Stop/restart and [[Rocket engine#Throttling|throttling]] are all easily incorporated into most designs.  Solid rockets rarely can be shut down easily and almost never have throttling or restart capabilities.\n\n===Disadvantages of hybrid rockets===\nHybrid rockets also exhibit some disadvantages when compared with liquid and solid rockets. These include:\n\n* Oxidizer-to-fuel ratio shift (\"O/F shift\") - with a constant oxidizer flow-rate, the ratio of fuel production rate to oxidizer flow rate will change as a grain regresses. This leads to off-peak operation from a chemical performance point of view. However, for a well-designed hybrid, O/F shift has a very small impact on performance because <math>I_{sp}</math> is insensitive to O/F shift near the peak.\n* Low regression-rate (rate at which the solid phase recedes) fuels often drive multi-port fuel grains. Multi-port fuel grains have poor volumetric efficiency and, often, structural deficiencies. High regression rate liquefying fuels developed in the late 1990s offer a potential solution to this problem.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2003/28jan_envirorocket.htm | title = Wax Hybrids | publisher = Science@NASA | accessdate = 2009-06-01}}</ref>\n* Compared with liquid-based propulsion, re-fueling a partially or totally depleted hybrid rocket would present significant challenges, as the solid propellant cannot simply be pumped into a fuel tank. This may or may not be an issue, depending upon how the rocket is planned to be used.\n\nIn general, much less development work has been completed with hybrids than liquids or solids and it is likely that some of these disadvantages could be rectified through further investment in [[research and development]].\n\nOne problem in designing large hybrid orbital rockets is that turbopumps become necessary to achieve high flow rates and pressurization of the oxidizer. This turbopump must be powered by something. In a traditional liquid-propellant rocket, the turbopump uses the same fuel and oxidizer as the rocket, since they are both liquid and can be fed to the pre-burner. But in a hybrid, the fuel is solid and cannot be fed to a turbopump's engine. Some hybrids use an oxidizer that can also be used as a [[monopropellant]], such as [[nitromethane]] or [[hydrogen peroxide]], and so a turbopump can run on it alone. But nitromethane and hydrogen peroxide are significantly less efficient than liquid oxygen, which cannot be used alone to run a turbopump. Another fuel would be needed, requiring its own tank and decreasing rocket performance.\n\n==Hybrid safety==\nGenerally, well designed and carefully constructed hybrids are very safe. The primary hazards associated with hybrids are:\n\n* '''Pressure vessel failures''' - Chamber insulation failure may allow hot combustion gases near the chamber walls leading to a \"burn-through\" in which the vessel ruptures.\n* '''Blow back''' - For oxidizers that decompose exothermically such as nitrous oxide or [[hydrogen peroxide]], flame or hot gasses from the combustion chamber can propagate back through the injector, igniting the oxidizer and leading to a tank explosion. Blow-back requires gases to flow back through the injector due to insufficient pressure drop which can occur during periods of unstable combustion. Blow back is inherent to specific oxidizers and is not possible with oxidizers such as [[oxygen]] or [[nitrogen tetroxide]] unless fuel is present in the oxidizer tank.\n* '''Hard starts''' - An excess of oxidizer in the combustion chamber prior to ignition, particularly for monopropellants such as nitrous oxide, can result in a temporary over-pressure or \"spike\" at ignition.\n\nBecause the fuel in a hybrid does not contain an oxidizer, it will not combust explosively on its own. For this reason, hybrids are classified as having no [[TNT equivalent]] explosive power. In contrast, [[solid rocket]]s often have TNT equivalencies similar in magnitude to the mass of the propellant grain. [[Liquid-fuel rocket]]s typically have TNT equivalencies calculated based on the amount of fuel and oxidizer which could realistically intimately combine before igniting explosively; this is often taken to be 10\u201320% of the total propellant mass. For hybrids, even filling the combustion chamber with oxidizer prior to ignition will not generally create an explosion with the solid fuel, the explosive equivalence is often quoted as 0%.\n\n== Operational hybrids ==\nIn 1998 [[SpaceDev]] acquired all of the intellectual property, designs, and test results generated by over 200 hybrid rocket motor firings by the [[American Rocket Company]] over its eight-year life. [[SpaceShipOne]], the first private manned spacecraft, was powered by SpaceDev's hybrid rocket motor burning HTPB with nitrous oxide. However, nitrous oxide was the prime substance responsible for the explosion that killed three in the development of the successor of SpaceShipOne at [[Scaled Composites]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/30/virgin-galactic-spaceship_n_373978.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Bianca | last=Bosker | title=Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo getting ready for test flights ahead of space tourism | date=2009-11-30}}</ref><ref>http://news.softpedia.com/news/Spaceship-Test-at-the-Mojave-Desert-Test-Area-Kills-2-61171.shtml</ref>  The [[Virgin Galactic]] [[SpaceShipTwo]] follow-on commercial suborbital spaceplane uses a scaled-up hybrid motor.\n\nSpaceDev was developing the [[SpaceDev Streaker]], an expendable small launch vehicle, and [[SpaceDev Dream Chaser]], capable of both suborbital and orbital human space flight. Both Streaker and Dream Chaser use hybrid rocket motors that burn nitrous oxide and the synthetic rubber HTPB. SpaceDev was acquired by [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]] in 2009, becoming its Space Systems division, which continues to develop Dream Chaser for NASA's [[Commercial Crew Development]] contract. Sierra Nevada also developed [[RocketMotorTwo]], the hybrid engine for [[SpaceShipTwo]]. On October 31, 2014 [[SpaceShipTwo]] was lost, initial speculation had suggested that its hybrid engine had in fact exploded and killed one test pilot and seriously injured the other. However investigation data now indicates an early deployment of the SpaceShip-Two feather system was the cause for aerodynamic breakup of the vehicle.<ref>http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/virgin-voyage/virgin-galactics-spaceshiptwo-crashes-1-dead-1-injured-n238376</ref>\n\nU.S. Rockets <ref>http://v-serv.com/usr/crr457mm.htm</ref> manufactures and deploys hybrids using self-pressurizing nitrous oxide N<sub>2</sub>O and HTPB as well as HTP and HTPB. The High Test Hydrogen Peroxide H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 86% and Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) and aluminum hybrids developed by U.S. Rockets produce a sea level delivered specific impulse (I<sub>sp</sub>) of 240, well above the typical 180 of N<sub>2</sub>O-HTPB hybrids. In addition to that, they are self-starting, restartable, have considerably lower combustion instability making them suitable for fragile or manned missions such as Bloodhound SSC, SpaceShip Two or SpaceShip Three. The company has successfully tested<ref name=\"USR Hybrid\">Video of an 18\" diameter self-starting and ending HTP-HTPB hybrid near Garlock, CA.

Deliverables to date have ranged from 6 inch to 18 inch diameter, and development units up to 54 inch diameter. The vendor claims scalability to over 5 meters diameter with regression rates approaching solids, according to literature distributed at the November 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency meeting for XS-1.\n\n== Organizations working on hybrids ==\n\n===Commercial Companies===\nGilmour Space Technologies began testing Hybrid rocket engines in 2015 with both N<sub>2</sub>O and HP with HDPE and HDPE wax blends. 2016 testing includes a 5000 Lb HP/PE engine.  The company is planning to use hybrids for both sounding and orbital rockets.\n\n[[Orbital Technologies Corporation]] (Orbitec) has been involved in some US government-funded research on hybrid rockets including the \"Vortex Hybrid\" concept.<ref>[http://orbitec.com/documents/hybrid_rocket_motor.html Orbitec] Orbitec Vortex Hybrid Test, with photo.

Their fuel is epoxy, [[paraffin wax]], or polyurethane.<ref>[http://copenhagensuborbitals.com/boosters.php Copenhagen Suborbitals] HEAT booster development and tests, with photos and video. Accessed 2010-06-03</ref> The group eventually moved away from hybrids because of thrust instabilities, and now uses a motor similar to that of the [[V-2 rocket]].\n\n===Universities===\n[[Space Propulsion Group]] was founded in 1999 by Dr. Arif Karabeyoglu, Prof. Brian Cantwell and others from Stanford University to develop high regression-rate liquefying hybrid rocket fuels. They have successfully fired motors as large as 12.5 in. diameter which produce 13,000&nbsp;lbf. using the technology and are currently developing a 24 in. diameter, 25,000&nbsp;lbf. motor to be initially fired in 2010. [[Stanford University]] is the institution where liquid-layer combustion theory for hybrid rockets was developed. The SPaSE group at Stanford is currently working with NASA Ames Research Center developing the Peregrine Sounding rocket which will be capable of 100&nbsp;km altitude.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.stanford.edu/dept/aeroastro/aeroastro/50th/posters/peregrine.pdf |title=Peregrine rocket poster (2008) }}.

Using [[acids]], oxygen or nitrous oxide in combination with [[polyethylene]] or [[HTPB]]. The development includes test stand engines as well as airborne versions, like the first German hybrid rocket [[Barbarella (rocket)|Barbarella]]. They are currently working on a hybrid rocket with [[Liquid oxygen]] as its oxidizer, to break the European height record of amateur rockets. They are also  working with Rocket Crafters and testing their hybrid rockets.\n\n[[Boston University]]'s student-run \"Rocket Propulsion Group\",<ref>[http://www.burocket.org/ \"Rocket Propulsion Group\"], Boston University</ref> which in the past has launched only solid motor rockets, is attempting to design and build a single-stage hybrid sounding rocket to launch into sub-orbital space by July 2015.<ref>[http://www.burocket.org/rockets/starscraper/ \"Rocket Propulsion Group >> Starscraper\"] Boston University</ref>\n\n[[Brigham Young University]] (BYU), the [[University of Utah]], and [[Utah State University]] launched a student-designed rocket called Unity IV in 1995 which burned the solid fuel [[hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene]] (HTPB) with an oxidizer of gaseous oxygen, and in 2003 launched a larger version which burned HTPB with nitrous oxide.\n\n[[University of Brasilia]]'s Hybrid Team has extensive research in [[paraffin wax]]/N<sub>2</sub> hybrids having already made more than 50 tests fires.

Each rocket has an outer diameter of 150mm and is 1.4m long.  They use a fuel grain of high-density wound paper soaked in cooking oil. The N<sub>2</sub>O supply is provided by Nitrogen-pressurised piston accumulators which provide a higher rate of delivery than N<sub>2</sub>O gas alone and also provide damping of any reverse shock.\n\nIn [[Italy]] one of the leading centers for research in hybrid propellants rockets is CISAS (Center of Studies and Activities for Space) \"G. Colombo\", [[University of Padua]]. The activities cover all stages of the development: from theoretical analysis of the combustion process to numerical simulation using CFD codes, and then by conducting ground tests of small scale and large-scale rockets (up to 20&nbsp;kN, N<sub>2</sub>O-[[Paraffin wax]] based motors). One of these engines flew successfully in 2009.\n\nIn [[Taiwan]], hybrid rocket system developments began in 2009 through R&D projects of [[NSPO]] with two university teams. Both teams employed nitrous oxide/HTPB propellant system with different improvement schemes. One team (NCKU) added 50 percent of paraffin in the solid grain for boosting the regression rates. The other team ([[Advanced Rocket Research Center|ARRC]]/NCTU) incorporated innovative mixing enhancement devices to push the overall combustion efficiency towards the theoretical value. This team takes full advantage of high-fidelity simulations and experimental works for very cost-effective developments. Several hybrid rockets have been successfully launched so far, reaching altitudes of 10~20&nbsp;km. Their plans include attempting 100~200&nbsp;km altitude launch to test nanosatellites by the end of 2014, and developing orbital launch capabilities for nanosatellites in the long run. A sub-scale N<sub>2</sub>O/PE Dual-Vortical-Flow (DVF) hybrid engine hot-fire test in 2014 has delivered an averaged sea-level Isp of 280 sec, which indicates that the system has reached around 97% combustion efficiency.\n\nMany other universities, such as [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]], [[Purdue University]], the [[University of Michigan]] at Ann Arbor, the [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]], [[Hendrix College]], the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], [[Portland State University]], [[University of KwaZulu-Natal]], [[Texas A&M University]] and [[Aarhus University]] have hybrid motor test stands that allow for student research with hybrid rockets.\n\n===High Power Rocketry===\nThere are a number of hybrid rocket motor systems available for amateur/hobbyist use in high-powered model rocketry. These include the popular HyperTek systems<ref>[http://www.hypertekhybrids.com HyperTek]</ref> and a number of 'Urbanski-Colburn Valved' (U/C) systems such as RATTWorks,<ref>[http://www.rattworks.net RATTWorks]</ref> HyperTek,<ref>[http://www.skyrippersystems.com Skyripper Systems, dead link]</ref> West Coast Hybrids,<ref>[http://www.westcoasthybrids.com West Coast Hybrids, dead link]</ref> Contrail Rockets,<ref>[http://www.contrailrockets.com/ Contrail Rockets]</ref> and Propulsion Polymers.<ref>[http://www.propulsionpolymers.com Propulsion Polymers, dead link]</ref> \nAll of these systems use nitrous oxide as the oxidizer and a plastic fuel (such as [[Polyvinyl chloride]](PVC) or [[Polypropylene]]) or a polymer-based fuel such as HTPB. This reduces the cost per flight compared to solid rocket motors, although there is generally more 'GSE' (ground support equipment) required with hybrids.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1953 Pacific Rocket Society (est. 1943) was developing the XDF-23, a 4\" x 72\" hybrid rocket, designed by Jim Nuding, using LOX and rubber polyall called \"Thiokol\". They had already tried other fuels in prior iterations including cotton, [[paraffin wax]] and wood.  The XDF name itself comes from eXperimental Douglas Fir from one of the first units.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nd8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA81&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Q3YzT6TaKu2o0AHgjvW_Ag&ved=0CDMQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q&f=true April 1954 Popular Mechanics magazine] \"With the amateur - but serious - rocketeers out on the Mojave desert, it's Fourth of July the year around.

The myth purported that during the [[American Civil War]], the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] was able to construct a rocket of this type. The myth was revisited in a later episode entitled ''[[MythBusters (2006 season)#Salami Rocket|Salami Rocket]]'', using hollowed out dry [[salami]] as the solid fuel.\n\nIn the February 18, 2007 episode of [[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]], a [[Reliant Robin]] was used by [[Richard Hammond]] and [[James May]] in an attempt to modify a normal K-reg Robin into a reusable [[space shuttle]]. Steve Holland, a professional [[radio-controlled aircraft]] pilot, helped Hammond to work out how to land a Robin safely. The craft was built by Senior members of  the [[United Kingdom Rocketry Association]] (UKRA) and achieved a successful launch, flew for several seconds into the air and managed to successfully jettison the solid-fuel rocket boosters on time. This was the largest rocket launched by a non-government organisation in Europe. It used 6 x 40960 NS O Contrail Rockets motors giving a maximum thrust of 8 metric tons. However, the car failed to separate from the large external fuel tank due to faulty explosive bolts between the Robin and the external tank and the Robin subsequently crashed into the ground and ''seemed'' to have exploded soon after. In fact this explosion was added for dramatic effect as neither Reliant Robins nor hybrid rocket motors explode in the way depicted.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Spacecraft propulsion]]\n* [[Rocket]]ry\n* [[SpaceDev]]\n* [[Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne]]\n* [[Space Propulsion Group]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Hybrid rocket engines}}\n<!-- this link does not down load pdf file well, so that changed to link below.\n* [http://www.aspirespace.org.uk/aspireold/TechSeries/Introduction%20to%20hybrid%20design.pdf Aspirespace Introduction to hybrid design]\n-->\n* [http://www.hybrid-engine-development.de Developing and testing of a 2kN hybrid rocket engine] {{de icon}}\n* [http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/aspirespace/Hybrid%20Engines.htm Hybrid Rocket Engines, AspireSpace, membership-based organisation (in UK)] (particularly see [http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/aspirespace/TechPapers.htm technical papers])\n* [http://psas.pdx.edu/HybridLinks Portland State Aerospace Society paraffin hybrid links]\n* {{Cite journal|author= |year= |title=Preliminary Analysis of Hybrid Rockets for Launching Nanosats into LEO | journal= | volume= |issue=  |publisher= |pages=  |url= http://www.scielo.br/pdf/jbsmse/v32n4/v32n4a12.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= 2016-01-31 |quote= |ref=}}\n* [http://www.c-turbines.ch Hybridrocket, Private page] {{de icon}}\n* [http://www.warr.de/raketentechnik WARR, students developing hybrid engines] {{de icon}}\n* [http://www.t4innovation.com/en/ University of Padua spin-off]\n\n{{Spacecraft propulsion}}\n\n[[Category:Rocket propulsion]]\n[[Category:Rocket engines by propellant]]\n[[Category:Rocketry]]"}]}}}}
