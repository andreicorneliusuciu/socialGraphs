Stations can be linked in [[radio network]]s to broadcast a common [[radio format]], either in [[broadcast syndication]] or [[simulcast]] or both. Audio broadcasting also can be done via [[cable radio]], local wire [[television network]]s, [[satellite radio]], and [[internet radio]] via [[streaming media]] on the [[Internet]]. The signal types can be either [[analog audio]] or [[digital audio]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of radio#Broadcasting|History of broadcasting}}\n\nThe earliest  [[radio]] stations were simply [[radiotelegraphy]] systems and did not carry audio. For audio broadcasts to be possible electronic detection and amplification devices had to be incorporated.\n\nThe [[thermionic valve]] was invented in 1904 by the English physicist [[John Ambrose Fleming]]. He developed a device he called an \"oscillation valve\" (because it passes current in only one direction). The heated filament, or [[cathode]], was capable of [[thermionic emission]] of electrons that would flow to the ''[[Plate electrode|plate]]'' (or ''[[anode]]'') when it was at a higher voltage. Electrons, however, could not pass in the reverse direction because the plate was not heated and thus not capable of thermionic emission of electrons. Later known as the [[Fleming valve]], it could be used as a [[rectifier]] of alternating current and as a radio wave [[Detector (radio)|detector]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2012|title=The age of vacuum tubes: Early devices and the rise of radio communications|journal=IEEE Ind.

However, what was still required was an amplifier.\n\nThe [[triode]] (mercury-vapor filled with a control grid) was patented on March 4, 1906 by the Austrian [[Robert von Lieben]]<ref>[http://www.hts-homepage.de/Lieben/Lieben.html] DRP 179807</ref><ref>Tapan K.

[[Charles Herrold]] started broadcasting in [[California]] in 1909 and was carrying audio by the next year. (Herrold's station eventually became [[KCBS (AM)|KCBS]]).\n\nIn The Hague, the Netherlands, [[PCGG]] started broadcasting on November 6, 1919, making it, arguably the first commercial broadcasting station. In 1916, [[Frank Conrad]], an electrical engineer employed at the [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Corporation]], began broadcasting from his [[Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania]] garage with the call letters 8XK. Later, the station was moved to the top of the Westinghouse factory building in [[East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. Westinghouse relaunched the station as [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]] on November 2, 1920, as the first commercially licensed radio station in America.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Baudino|first=Joseph E|author2=John M.

The first licensed broadcast in the United States came from KDKA itself: the results of the [[U.S. presidential election, 1920|Harding/Cox Presidential Election]]. The [[Montreal]] station that became [[CFCF-AM|CFCF]] began [[broadcast programming]] on May 20, 1920, and the [[Detroit]] station that became [[WWJ (AM)|WWJ]] began program broadcasts beginning on August 20, 1920, although neither held a license at the time.\n\nIn 1920 wireless broadcasts for entertainment began in the UK from the [[Marconi Research Centre]] [[2MT]] at [[Writtle]] near [[Chelmsford, England]]. A famous broadcast from Marconi's New Street Works factory in Chelmsford was made by the famous [[soprano]] Dame [[Nellie Melba]] on 15 June 1920, where she sang two arias and her famous trill. She was the first artist of international renown to participate in direct radio broadcasts. The [[2MT]] station began to broadcast regular entertainment in 1922. The [[BBC]] was amalgamated in 1922 and received a [[Royal Charter]] in 1926, making it the first national broadcaster in the world,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.g0mwt.org.uk/new-street/|title=Callsign 2MT & New Street}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=BBC History \u2013 The BBC takes to the Airwaves|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/aboutbbcnews/spl/hi/history/html/default.stm|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> followed by [[Czech Radio]] and other European broadcasters in 1923.\n\nRadio Argentina began regularly scheduled transmissions from the [[Teatro Coliseo]] in [[Buenos Aires]] on August 27, 1920, making its own priority claim. The station got its license on November 19, 1923. The delay was due to the lack of official Argentine licensing procedures before that date. This station continued regular broadcasting of entertainment and cultural fare for several decades.<ref>Atgelt, Carlos A. [http://www.oldradio.com/archives/international/argentin.html \"Early History of Radio Broadcasting in Argentina.\"] The Broadcast Archive (Oldradio.com).</ref>\n\nRadio in education soon followed and colleges across the U.S. began adding radio broadcasting courses to their curricula. Curry College in Milton, Massachusetts introduced one of the first broadcasting majors in 1932 when the college teamed up with WLOE in Boston to have students broadcast programs.<ref>http://www.curry.edu</ref>\n\n==Types==\n[[Image:Radio Transmission Diagram en.svg|thumb|right|260px|Transmission diagram of sound broadcasting (AM and FM)]]\nBroadcasting by radio takes several forms. These include [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations. There are several subtypes, namely [[commercial broadcasting]], [[non-commercial educational]] (NCE) [[public broadcasting]] and [[non-profit]] varieties as well as [[community radio]], student-run [[campus radio]] stations and [[hospital radio]] stations can be found throughout the world.\n\nMany stations broadcast on [[shortwave]] bands using AM technology that can be received over thousands of miles (especially at night). For example, the [[BBC World Service|BBC]], [[Voice of America|VOA]], [[Voice of Russia|VOR]], and [[Deutsche Welle]] have transmitted via shortwave to Africa and Asia. These broadcasts are very sensitive to atmospheric conditions and solar activity.\n\n[[Nielsen Audio]], formerly known as Arbitron, the [[United States]]-based company that reports on radio audiences, defines a \"radio station\" as a government-licensed AM or FM station; an HD Radio (primary or multicast) station; an internet stream of an existing government-licensed station; one of the satellite radio channels from [[XM Satellite Radio]] or [[Sirius Satellite Radio]]; or, potentially, a station that is not government licensed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/newbay/rw_20081008/index.php|title=What is a Radio Station?|work=[[Radio World]]|page=6}}</ref>\n\n===Shortwave===\nSee [[shortwave]] for the differences between shortwave, [[medium wave]] and [[long wave]] spectra. Shortwave is used largely for national broadcasters, international propaganda, or [[religious broadcasting]] organizations.\n\n===AM===\n{{main article|AM broadcasting}}\n[[Image:2006AM broadcast stations.PNG|thumb|right|260px|AM broadcasting stations in 2006]]\nAM stations were the earliest broadcasting stations to be developed. AM refers to [[amplitude modulation]], a mode of broadcasting radio waves by varying the amplitude of the carrier signal in response to the amplitude of the signal to be transmitted.\n\nThe medium-wave band is used worldwide for AM broadcasting. Europe also uses the [[long wave]] band. In response to the growing popularity of [[FM broadcasting#Stereo FM|FM stereo]] radio stations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, some [[North America]]n stations began broadcasting in [[AM stereo]], though this never gained popularity, and very few receivers were ever sold.\n\nOne of the advantages of AM is that its signal can be detected (turned into sound) with simple equipment. If a signal is strong enough, not even a power source is needed; building an unpowered [[crystal radio|crystal radio receiver]] was a common childhood project in the early decades of AM broadcasting.\n\nAM broadcasts occur on [[North America]]n airwaves in the [[medium wave]] frequency range of 530 to 1700 [[Hertz|kHz]] (known as the \u201cstandard broadcast band\u201d). The band was expanded in the 1990s by adding nine [[channel (communications)|channels]] from 1620 to 1700&nbsp;kHz. Channels are spaced every 10&nbsp;kHz in the [[Americas]], and generally every 9&nbsp;kHz everywhere else.\n\nThe signal is subject to interference from electrical storms ([[lightning]]) and other [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI).\n\nAM transmissions cannot be ionospherically [[radio propagation|propagated]] during the day due to strong absorption in the [[D-layer]] of the ionosphere. In a crowded channel environment this means that the power of regional channels which share a frequency must be reduced at night or directionally beamed in order to avoid interference, which reduces the potential nighttime audience. Some stations have frequencies unshared with other stations in North America; these are called [[clear-channel station]]s. Many of them can be heard across much of the country at night. During the night, absorption largely disappears and permits signals to travel to much more distant locations via ionospheric reflections. However, fading of the signal can be severe at night.\n\nAM radio transmitters can transmit audio frequencies up to 15&nbsp;kHz (now limited to 10&nbsp;kHz in the US due to FCC rules designed to reduce interference), but most receivers are only capable of reproducing frequencies up to 5&nbsp;kHz or less. At the time that AM broadcasting began in the 1920s, this provided adequate fidelity for existing microphones, 78 rpm recordings, and loudspeakers. The fidelity of sound equipment subsequently improved considerably, but the receivers did not. Reducing the bandwidth of the receivers reduces the cost of manufacturing and makes them less prone to interference. AM stations are never assigned adjacent channels in the same service area. This prevents the sideband power generated by two stations from interfering with each other.<ref>http://kwarner.bravehost.com/tech.htm</ref> [[Bob Carver]] created an [[AM stereo]] tuner employing [[notch filter]]ing that demonstrated that an AM broadcast can meet or exceed the 15&nbsp;kHz baseband bandwidth allotted to [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations without objectionable interference. After several years, the tuner was discontinued. Bob Carver had left the company and the Carver Corporation later cut the number of models produced before discontinuing production completely.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n===FM===\n{{main article|FM broadcasting}}\n[[Image:2006FM broadcast stations.PNG|thumb|right|260px|[[FM radio]] broadcast stations in 2006]]\nFM refers to [[frequency modulation]], and occurs on [[VHF]] airwaves in the frequency range of 88 to 108 [[Megahertz|MHz]] everywhere except [[Japan]] and [[Russia]]. Russia, like the former Soviet Union, uses 65.9 to 74&nbsp;MHz frequencies in addition to the world standard. Japan uses the 76 to 90&nbsp;MHz frequency band.\n\n[[Edwin Howard Armstrong]] invented FM radio to overcome the problem of [[Electromagnetic interference|radio-frequency interference]] (RFI), which plagued AM radio reception. At the same time, greater fidelity was made possible by spacing stations further apart in the [[radio frequency]] spectrum. Instead of 10&nbsp;kHz apart, as on the AM band in the US, FM channels are 200&nbsp;kHz (0.2&nbsp;MHz) apart. In other countries greater spacing is sometimes mandatory, such as in New Zealand, which uses 700&nbsp;kHz spacing (previously 800&nbsp;kHz). The improved fidelity made available was far in advance of the audio equipment of the 1940s, but wide interchannel spacing was chosen to take advantage of the noise-suppressing feature of wideband FM.\n\nBandwidth of 200 [[kHz]] is not needed to accommodate an audio signal &mdash; 20&nbsp;kHz to 30&nbsp;kHz is all that is necessary for a narrowband FM signal. The 200&nbsp;kHz bandwidth allowed room for \u00b175&nbsp;kHz signal deviation from the assigned frequency, plus guard bands to reduce or eliminate adjacent channel interference. The larger bandwidth allows for broadcasting a 15&nbsp;kHz bandwidth audio signal plus a 38&nbsp;kHz stereo \"subcarrier\"\u2014a piggyback signal that rides on the main signal. Additional unused capacity is used by some broadcasters to transmit utility functions such as background [[music]] for public areas, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] auxiliary signals, or financial market data.\n\nThe AM radio problem of interference at night was addressed in a different way. At the time FM was set up, the available frequencies were far higher in the spectrum than those used for AM radio - by a factor of approximately 100. Using these frequencies meant that even at far higher power, the range of a given FM signal was much shorter; thus its market was more local than for AM radio. The reception range at night is the same as in the daytime. All FM broadcast transmissions are line-of-sight, and ionospheric bounce is not viable. The much larger bandwidths, compared to AM and SSB, are more susceptible to phase dispersion. Propagation speeds (celerities) are fastest in the ionosphere at the lowest sideband frequency. The celerity difference between the highest and lowest sidebands is quite apparent to the listener. Such distortion occurs up to frequencies of approximately 50&nbsp;MHz. Higher frequencies do not reflect from the ionosphere, nor from storm clouds. Moon reflections have been used in some experiments, but require impractical power levels.\n\nThe original FM radio service in the U.S. was the [[Yankee Network]], located in [[New England]].<ref>Halper, Donna L. [http://www.bostonradio.org/essays/shepard-fm.html \"John Shepard's FM Stations\u2014America's first FM network.\"] Boston Radio Archives (BostonRadio.org).</ref><ref>[http://www.bostonradio.org/yankee-36.html \"The Yankee Network in 1936.\"] Boston Radio Archives (BostonRadio.org)</ref><ref>Miller, Jeff. [http://jeff560.tripod.com/chronofm.html \"FM Broadcasting Chronology.\"] Rev. 2005-12-27.</ref> Regular FM broadcasting began in 1939, but did not pose a significant threat to the AM broadcasting industry. It required purchase of a special receiver. The frequencies used, 42 to 50&nbsp;MHz, were not those used today. The change to the current frequencies, 88 to 108&nbsp;MHz, began after the end of [[World War II]], and was to some extent imposed by AM broadcasters as an attempt to cripple what was by now realized to be a potentially serious threat.\n\nFM radio on the new band had to begin from the ground floor. As a commercial venture it remained a little-used audio enthusiasts' medium until the 1960s. The more prosperous AM stations, or their owners, acquired FM licenses and often broadcast the same programming on the FM station as on the AM station (\"[[simulcasting]]\"). The FCC limited this practice in the 1960s. By the 1980s, since almost all new radios included both AM and FM tuners, FM became the dominant medium, especially in cities. Because of its greater range, AM remained more common in rural environments.\n\n===Pirate radio===\n{{Main article|Pirate radio}}\nPirate radio is illegal or non-regulated radio transmission. It is most commonly used to describe illegal broadcasting for entertainment or political purposes. Sometimes it is used for illegal two-way radio operation. Its history can be traced back to the unlicensed nature of the transmission, but historically there has been occasional use of sea vessels\u2014fitting the most common perception of a pirate\u2014as broadcasting bases.\nRules and regulations vary largely from country to country, but often the term pirate radio generally describes the unlicensed broadcast of FM radio, AM radio, or short wave signals over a wide range. In some places radio stations are legal where the signal is transmitted, but illegal where the signals are received\u2014especially when the signals cross a national boundary. In other cases, a broadcast may be considered \"pirate\" due to the type of content, its transmission format, or the transmitting power (wattage) of the station, even if the transmission is not technically illegal (such as a web cast or an amateur radio transmission). Pirate radio stations are sometimes referred to as bootleg radio or clandestine stations.\n\n===Terrestrial digital radio===\n[[Digital radio]] broadcasting has emerged, first in [[Europe]] (the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1995 and [[Germany]] in 1999), and later in the United States, France, the Netherlands, South Africa and many other countries worldwide. The most simple system is named DAB Digital Radio, for [[Digital Audio Broadcasting]], and uses the [[public domain]] [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|EUREKA 147]] (Band III) system. DAB is used mainly in the UK and South Africa. Germany and the Netherlands use the DAB and DAB+ systems, and France uses the L-Band system of DAB Digital Radio.\n\nIn the United States, digital radio isn't used in the same way as Europe and South Africa. Instead, the [[IBOC]] system is named [[HD Radio]] and owned by a [[consortium]] of private companies that is called [[iBiquity]]. An international [[non-profit]] consortium [[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM), has introduced the [[public domain]] DRM system.\n\n===Satellite===\n{{Expand section|date=November 2008}}\n[[Satellite radio]] broadcasters are slowly emerging, but the enormous entry costs of space-based satellite transmitters, and restrictions on available [[radio spectrum]] licenses has restricted growth of this market. In the USA and [[Canada]], just two services, [[XM Satellite Radio]] and [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] exist. Both XM and Sirius are owned by [[Sirius XM Radio]], which was formed by the merger of XM and Sirius on July 29, [[2008 in radio|2008]], whereas in [[Canada]], [[XM Radio Canada]] and [[Sirius Canada]] remained separate companies until 2010. [[1worldspace|Worldspace]] in Africa and Asia, and [[MobaHo!|MobaHO!]] in Japan and the ROK were two unsuccessful satellite radio operators which have gone out of business.\n\n==Program formats==\n{{Main article|Radio format}}\n\nRadio program formats differ by country, regulation and markets. For instance, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] designates the 88&ndash;92 megahertz band in the U.S. for non-profit or educational programming, with advertising prohibited.\n\nIn addition, formats change in popularity as time passes and technology improves. Early radio equipment only allowed program material to be broadcast in real time, known as ''live'' broadcasting. As technology for [[sound recording]] improved, an increasing proportion of broadcast programming used pre-recorded material. A current trend is the [[automation]] of radio stations. Some stations now operate without direct human intervention by using entirely pre-recorded material sequenced by [[computer]] control.\n\n==See also==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Broadcasting construction permit]]\n* [[Call sign]]\n* [[Disc jockey]] (DJ)\n* [[History of broadcasting]]\n* [[International broadcasting]]\n* [[List of radio topics]]\n* [[Low power radio station]]\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Radio]]\n* [[Radio antenna]]\n* [[Radio network]]\n* [[Radio personality]]\n* [[RF modulation]]\n* [[Sports commentator]]\n* [[Television station]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Briggs Asa.
