For instance, a dental technician is viewed of lower social status and a lower level of respect compared to a dentist. Experienced technicians in a specific [[tool]] [[Field of study|domain]] typically have intermediate understanding of [[theory]] and expert proficiency in technique. As such, technicians are generally better versed in technique compared to average [[laymen]] and even general [[professional]]s in that field of technology. For example, although [[sound reproduction|audio]] technicians are not as [[learn]]ed in [[acoustics]] as [[Acoustical engineering|acoustical engineer]]s, they are more proficient in operating sound equipment, and they will likely know more about acoustics than other studio staff such as repairmen.\n\nTechnicians may be classified as either highly [[skilled worker]]s or at times [[American system of manufacturing|semi-skilled workers]], and may be part of a larger ([[Manufacturing|production]]) [[industrial process|process]]. They may be found working in a variety of fields, and they usually have a job title with the designation 'technician' following the particular category of work. Thus a 'stage technician' is a worker who provides technical support for putting on a [[Play (theatre)|play]], while a 'medical technician' is an employee who provides technical support in the [[medical]] industry or to the medical profession.  An [[engineering technician]] in the UK is a highly skilled, highly educated occupation requiring 5\u20138 years post high school [[training]]  in a formal apprenticeship and college of further education.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Grey-collar worker]]\n*[[Technical school]]\n*[[Tradesperson]]\n*[[Vocational education]]\n\n[[Category:Broadcasting occupations]]\n[[Category:Media occupations]]\n[[Category:Technicians| ]]\n[[Category:Television terminology]]"}]}}}}
