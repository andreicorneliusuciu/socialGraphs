Protons and [[neutron]]s, each with masses of approximately one [[atomic mass unit]], are collectively referred to as \"[[nucleon]]s\". One or more protons are present in the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of every [[atom]]. They are a necessary part of the nucleus. The number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of an element, and is referred to as the [[atomic number]] (represented by the symbol Z). Since each [[chemical element|element]] has a unique number of protons, each element has its own unique atomic number. The word ''proton'' is Greek for \"first\", and this name was given to the hydrogen nucleus by [[Ernest Rutherford]] in 1920. In previous years Rutherford had discovered that the hydrogen nucleus (known to be the lightest nucleus) could be extracted from the nuclei of nitrogen by collision. Protons were therefore a candidate to be a [[fundamental particle]] and a building block of nitrogen and all other heavier atomic nuclei.\n\nIn the modern [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, protons are [[hadron]]s, and like [[neutron]]s, the other [[nucleon]] (particle present in atomic nuclei), are composed of three [[quark]]s. Although protons were originally considered fundamental or [[elementary particle]]s, they are now known to be composed of three valence quarks: two [[up quark]]s and one [[down quark]]. The [[rest mass]]es of quarks contribute only about 1% of a proton's mass, however.<ref name=\"Mass\">{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/physics/2010/04/mass-common-quark-finally-nailed-down |title=Mass of the Common Quark Finally Nailed Down |last1=Cho |first1=Adrian |date=2 April 2010 |website=Science Magazine |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The remainder of a proton's mass is due to [[quantum chromodynamics binding energy]], which includes the [[kinetic energy]] of the quarks and the energy of the [[gluon]] fields that bind the quarks together.

However, the character of such bound protons does not change, and they remain protons. A fast proton moving through matter will slow by interactions with electrons and nuclei, until it is captured by the [[electron cloud]] of an atom. The result is a protonated atom, which is a [[chemical compound]] of hydrogen. In vacuum, when free electrons are present, a sufficiently slow proton may pick up a single free electron, becoming a neutral [[hydrogen atom]], which is chemically a [[free radical]]. Such \"free hydrogen atoms\" tend to react chemically with many other types of atoms at sufficiently low energies. When free hydrogen atoms react with each other, they form neutral hydrogen molecules (H<sub>2</sub>), which are the most common molecular component of [[molecular clouds]] in [[interstellar medium|interstellar space]]. Such molecules of hydrogen on Earth may then serve (among many other uses) as a convenient source of protons for accelerators (as used in [[proton therapy]]) and other [[hadron]] [[particle physics experiments]] that require protons to accelerate, with the most powerful and noted example being the [[Large Hadron Collider]].\n\n==Description==\n{{unsolved|physics|How do the quarks and gluons carry the spin of protons?}}\n'''Protons''' are [[spin-\u00bd]] [[fermion]]s and are composed of three valence quarks,<ref>\n{{cite book\n |author=Adair, R.K.\n |year=1989\n |title=The Great Design: Particles, Fields, and Creation\n |page=214\n |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]\n |isbn=\n}}</ref> making them [[baryon]]s (a sub-type of [[hadron]]s).

The nucleus of the most common [[isotope]] of the [[hydrogen atom]] (with the [[chemical symbol]] \"H\") is a lone proton. The nuclei of the heavy hydrogen isotopes [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]] contain one proton bound to one and two neutrons, respectively. All other types of atomic nuclei are composed of two or more protons and various numbers of neutrons.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a hydrogen-like particle as a constituent of other atoms was developed over a long period. As early as 1815, [[William Prout]] proposed that all atoms are composed of hydrogen atoms (which he called \"protyles\"), based on a simplistic interpretation of early values of [[atomic weight]]s (see [[Prout's hypothesis]]), which was disproved when more accurate values were measured.<ref name=\"Lecturer2006\">{{cite book|author=Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry UCLA Eric R.

However, since particles from different gases had different values of [[charge-to-mass ratio]] (e/m), they could not be identified with a single particle, unlike the negative [[electron]]s discovered by [[J. J. Thomson]].\n\nFollowing the discovery of the atomic nucleus by [[Ernest Rutherford]] in 1911, [[Antonius van den Broek]] proposed that the place of each element in the [[periodic table]] (its atomic number) is equal to its nuclear charge. This was confirmed experimentally by [[Henry Moseley]] in 1913 using [[X-ray spectroscopy|X-ray spectra]].\n\nIn 1917 (in experiments reported in 1919), Rutherford proved that the hydrogen nucleus is present in other nuclei, a result usually described as the discovery of protons.<ref>{{cite book\n |author1=Petrucci, R.H.|author2=Harwood, W.S. |author3=Herring, F.G.\n |year=2002\n |title=General Chemistry\n |edition=8th\n |page=41\n |publisher=\n |isbn=\n}}</ref> Rutherford had earlier learned to produce hydrogen nuclei as a type of radiation produced as a product of the impact of alpha particles on nitrogen gas, and recognize them by their unique penetration signature in air and their appearance in scintillation detectors. These experiments were begun when Rutherford had noticed that, when [[alpha particles]] were shot into air (mostly nitrogen), his scintillation detectors showed the signatures of typical hydrogen nuclei as a product. After experimentation Rutherford traced the reaction to the nitrogen in air, and found that when alphas were produced into pure nitrogen gas, the effect was larger. Rutherford determined that this hydrogen could have come only from the nitrogen, and therefore nitrogen must contain hydrogen nuclei. One hydrogen nucleus was being knocked off by the impact of the alpha particle, producing oxygen-17 in the process. This was the first reported [[nuclear reaction]], <sup>14</sup>N + \u03b1 \u2192 <sup>17</sup>O + p. (This reaction would later be observed happening directly in a cloud chamber in 1925).\n\nRutherford knew hydrogen to be the simplest and lightest element and was influenced by [[Prout's hypothesis]] that hydrogen was the building block of all elements. Discovery that the hydrogen nucleus is present in all other nuclei as an elementary particle, led Rutherford to give the hydrogen nucleus a special name as a particle, since he suspected that hydrogen, the lightest element, contained only one of these particles. He named this new fundamental building block of the nucleus the ''proton,'' after the neuter singular of the Greek word for \"first\", \u03c0\u03c1\u1ff6\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd. However, Rutherford also had in mind the word ''protyle'' as used by Prout. Rutherford spoke at the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] at its [[Cardiff]] meeting beginning 24 August 1920.<ref>See [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v105/n2651/abs/105780a0.html meeting report] and [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/51/1330/627.2.extract announcement]</ref> Rutherford was asked by [[Oliver Lodge]] for a new name for the positive hydrogen nucleus to avoid confusion with the neutral hydrogen atom.

Or do they decay with a finite lifetime as predicted by some extensions to the standard model?}}\nThe free proton (a proton not bound to nucleons or electrons) is a stable particle that has not been observed to break down spontaneously to other particles. Free protons are found naturally in a number of situations in which energies or temperatures are high enough to separate them from electrons, for which they have some affinity. Free protons exist in [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]] in which temperatures are too high to allow them to combine with [[electron]]s. Free protons of high energy and velocity make up 90% of [[cosmic ray]]s, which propagate in vacuum for interstellar distances. Free protons are [[proton emission|emitted directly]] from [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] in some rare types of [[radioactive decay]]. Protons also result (along with electrons and [[antineutrino]]s) from the [[radioactive decay]] of free neutrons, which are unstable.\n\nThe spontaneous decay of free protons has never been observed, and protons are therefore considered stable particles according to the Standard Model. However, some [[Grand unified theory|grand unified theories]] (GUTs) of particle physics predict that [[proton decay]] should take place with lifetimes between 10<sup>31</sup> to 10<sup>36</sup> years and experimental searches have established lower bounds on the [[mean lifetime]] of a proton for various assumed decay products.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0370-2693(89)90637-0| title = An upper limit for the proton lifetime in SO(10)| journal = Physics Letters B| volume = 233| pages = 178| year = 1989| last1 = Buccella | first1 = F.| last2 = Miele | first2 = G.| last3 = Rosa | first3 = L.| last4 = Santorelli | first4 = P.| last5 = Tuzi | first5 = T.|bibcode = 1989PhLB..233..178B }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.51.229|arxiv=hep-ph/9404238| title = Predictions for the proton lifetime in minimal nonsupersymmetric SO(10) models: An update| journal = Physical Review D| volume = 51| pages = 229| year = 1995| last1 = Lee | first1 = D.

For free protons, this process does not occur spontaneously but only when energy is supplied. The equation is:\n\n:{{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron|link=yes}} \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino|link=yes}}\n\nThe process is reversible; neutrons can convert back to protons through [[beta decay]], a common form of [[radioactive decay]]. In fact, a [[free neutron]] decays this way, with a [[mean lifetime]] of about 15 minutes.\n\n==Quarks and the mass of a proton==\nIn [[quantum chromodynamics]], the modern theory of the nuclear force, most of the mass of protons and [[neutron]]s is explained by [[special relativity]]. The mass of a proton is about 80\u2013100 times greater than the sum of the rest masses of the [[quark]]s that make it up, while the [[gluon]]s have zero rest mass. The extra energy of the [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s in a region within a proton, as compared to the rest energy of the quarks alone in the [[QCD vacuum]], accounts for almost 99% of the mass. The rest mass of a proton is, thus, the [[invariant mass]] of the system of moving quarks and gluons that make up the particle, and, in such systems, even the energy of massless particles is [[mass-energy equivalence#Fast-moving objects and systems of objects|still measured]] as part of the rest mass of the system.\n\nTwo terms are used in referring to the mass of the quarks that make up protons: ''[[current quark]] mass'' refers to the mass of a quark by itself, while ''[[constituent quark]] mass'' refers to the current quark mass plus the mass of the [[gluon]] [[quantum field theory|particle field]] surrounding the quark.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |author=Watson, A.\n |title=The Quantum Quark\n |pages=285\u2013286\n |publisher=Cambridge University Press\n |year=2004\n |isbn=0-521-82907-0\n}}</ref>{{rp|285\u2013286}} <ref name=\"Smith2003\">{{cite book|author=Timothy Paul Smith|title=Hidden Worlds: Hunting for Quarks in Ordinary Matter|year=2003|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-05773-7}}</ref>{{rp|150\u2013151}} These masses typically have very different values.

However, the nucleus can be modeled as a sphere of positive charge for the interpretation of [[electron scattering]] experiments: because there is no definite boundary to the nucleus, the electrons \"see\" a range of cross-sections, for which a mean can be taken. The qualification of \"rms\" (for \"[[root mean square]]\") arises because it is the nuclear cross-section, proportional to the square of the radius, which is determining for electron scattering.\n\nThe internationally accepted value of a proton's [[charge radius]] is {{val|0.8768|ul=fm}} (see [[Orders of magnitude (length)#1E-15|orders of magnitude]] for comparison to other sizes). This value is based on measurements involving a proton and an electron (namely, [[electron scattering]] measurements and complex calculation involving scattering cross section based on [[Marshall Rosenbluth|Rosenbluth]] equation for [[momentum-transfer cross section]]), and studies of the atomic [[energy level]]s of hydrogen and deuterium.\n\nHowever, in 2010 an international research team published a proton charge radius measurement via the [[Lamb shift]] in muonic hydrogen (an [[exotic atom]] made of a proton and a negatively charged [[muon]]). Their measurement of the [[Root mean square|root-mean-square]] charge radius of a proton is \"{{val|0.84184|(67)|u=fm}}, which differs by 5.0 [[standard deviation]]s from the [[CODATA]] value of {{val|0.8768|(69)|u=fm}}\".<ref name=\"Radius\">\n{{Cite journal\n |doi=10.1038/nature09250 |pmid=20613837 |bibcode=2010Natur.466..213P |title=The size of the proton\n |journal=Nature |volume=466 |issue=7303 |pages=213\u20136 |date=8 July 2010\n |last1=Pohl |first1=Randolf |last2=Antognini |first2=Aldo |last3=Nez |first3=Fran\u00e7ois |last4=Amaro |first4=Fernando D.\n |last5=Biraben |first5=Fran\u00e7ois |last6=Cardoso |first6=Jo\u00e3o M.

High energy protons, in traversing ordinary matter, lose energy by collisions with [[atomic nuclei]], and by [[ionization]] of atoms (removing electrons) until they are slowed sufficiently to be captured by the [[electron cloud]] in a normal atom.\n\nHowever, in such an association with an electron, the character of the bound proton is not changed, and it remains a proton. The attraction of low-energy free protons to any electrons present in normal matter (such as the electrons in normal atoms) causes free protons to stop and to form a new chemical bond with an atom. Such a bond happens at any sufficiently \"cold\" temperature (i.e., comparable to temperatures at the surface of the Sun) and with any type of atom. Thus, in interaction with any type of normal (non-plasma) matter, low-velocity free protons are attracted to electrons in any atom or molecule with which they come in contact, causing the proton and molecule to combine. Such molecules are then said to be \"[[protonated]]\", and chemically they often, as a result, become so-called [[Bronsted acid]]s.\n\n==Proton in chemistry==\n\n===Atomic number===\nIn [[chemistry]], the number of protons in the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of an atom is known as the [[atomic number]], which determines the [[chemical element]] to which the atom belongs. For example, the atomic number of [[chlorine]] is 17; this means that each chlorine atom has 17 protons and that all atoms with 17 protons are chlorine atoms. The chemical properties of each atom are determined by the number of (negatively charged) [[electron]]s, which for neutral atoms is equal to the number of (positive) protons so that the total charge is zero. For example, a neutral chlorine atom has 17 protons and 17 electrons, whereas a Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> [[anion]] has 17 protons and 18 electrons for a total charge of \u22121.\n\nAll atoms of a given element are not necessarily identical, however, as the [[number of neutrons]] may vary to form different [[isotope]]s, and energy levels may differ forming different [[nuclear isomer]]s. For example, there are two stable [[isotopes of chlorine]]: {{Nuclide|Chlorine|35}} with 35 \u2212 17 = 18 neutrons and {{Nuclide|Chlorine|37}} with 37 \u2212 17 = 20 neutrons.\n\n===Hydrogen ion===\n{{see also|Hydron (chemistry)}}\n[[File:Hydrogen.svg|thumb|220px|Protium, the most common isotope of hydrogen, consists of one proton and one electron (it has no neutrons). The term \"hydrogen ion\" ({{chem|H|+}}) implies that that H-atom has lost its one electron, causing only a proton to remain. Thus, in chemistry, the terms \"proton\" and \"hydrogen ion\" (for the protium isotope) are used synonymously]]\n\n{{quote box|width=20%|align=left|bgcolor=cornsilk|quote='The proton is a unique chemical species, being a bare nucleus. As a consequence it has no independent existence in the condensed state and is invariably found bound by a pair of electrons to another atom.'|source=Ross Stewart, ''The Proton: Application to Organic Chemistry'' (1985, p. 1)}}\nIn chemistry, the term proton refers to the hydrogen ion, {{chem|H|+}}. Since the atomic number of hydrogen is 1, a hydrogen ion has no electrons and corresponds to a bare nucleus, consisting of a proton (and 0 neutrons for the most abundant isotope ''protium'' {{Nuclide2|Hydrogen|1|link=yes}}). The proton is a \"bare charge\" with only about 1/64,000 of the radius of a hydrogen atom, and so is extremely reactive chemically. The free proton, thus, has an extremely short lifetime in chemical systems such as liquids and it reacts immediately with the [[electron cloud]] of any available molecule. In aqueous solution, it forms the [[hydronium ion]], H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>, which in turn is further [[solvation|solvated]] by water molecules in [[Hydrogen ion#Cation (positively charged)|clusters]] such as [H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> and [H<sub>9</sub>O<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup>.<ref name=Headrick>{{cite journal |last=Headrick|first=J.M. |author2=Diken, E.G. |author3=Walters, R.

Likewise, [[biochemistry|biochemical]] terms such as [[proton pump]] and [[proton channel]] refer to the movement of hydrated {{chem|H|+}} ions.\n\nThe ion produced by removing the electron from a [[deuterium]] atom is known as a deuteron, not a proton. Likewise, removing an electron from a [[tritium]] atom produces a triton.\n\n===Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)===\nAlso in chemistry, the term \"[[proton NMR]]\" refers to the observation of hydrogen-1 nuclei in (mostly [[organic chemistry|organic]]) molecules by [[nuclear magnetic resonance]]. This method uses the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of the proton, which has the value one-half. The name refers to examination of protons as they occur in [[Hydrogen-1|protium]] (hydrogen-1 atoms) in compounds, and does not imply that free protons exist in the compound being studied.\n\n==Human exposure==\n{{main article|Effect of spaceflight on the human body}}\nThe [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]]s (ALSEP) determined that more than 95% of the particles in the [[solar wind]] are electrons and protons, in approximately equal numbers.<ref name=\"LPI\">\n{{cite web\n |year=2009\n |title=Apollo 11 Mission\n |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/apollo/apollo_11/experiments/swc/\n |publisher=[[Lunar and Planetary Institute]]\n |accessdate=2009-06-12\n}}</ref><ref name=\"BNL\"/>\n\n{{Quotation|Because the Solar Wind [[Spectrometer]] made continuous measurements, it was possible to measure how the [[Earth's magnetic field]] affects arriving solar wind particles.

For about five days of each month, the Moon is inside the Earth's geomagnetic tail, and typically no solar wind particles were detectable. For the remainder of each lunar orbit, the Moon is in a transitional region known as the [[magnetosheath]], where the Earth's magnetic field affects the solar wind but does not completely exclude it.
