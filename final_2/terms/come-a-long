The drum may be wrapped with [[wire rope]], [[nylon webbing]], or rope.\n\nCome-a-longs are not rated for overhead lifting, but a similar looking device called a ''ratchet lever'' [[Hoist (device)|''hoist'']] is used this way.\n\nThe original tool of this type was developed by Abraham Maasdam of Deep Creek, [[Colorado]] about 1919, and later commercialized by his son, Felber Maasdam, about 1946.  It has been copied by many manufacturers in recent decades. A similar heavy duty unit with a combination chain and cable became available in 1935 that was used by railroads, but lacked the success of the cable-only type units.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0ikDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA39&dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Science%22#v=onepage&q=Popular%20Science%201933%20plane%20%22Popular%20Science%22&f=true \"New Jack Enables One Man To Pull Heavy Loads\"] ''Popular Science'', May 1935, article & photo bottom of page 39</ref>\n\nA similar tool to a come-along is a ''cable puller'' which does not have a drum and ratchet but directly grips the cable allowing unlimited lengths of wire rope to be used.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Tools]]"}]}}}}
