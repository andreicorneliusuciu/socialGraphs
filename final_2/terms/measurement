Historically, many [[system of measurement|measurement systems]] existed for the varied fields of human existence to facilitate comparisons in these fields. Often these were achieved by local agreements between trading partners or collaborators. Since the 18th century, developments progressed towards unifying, widely accepted standards that resulted in the modern [[International System of Units]] (SI). This system reduces all physical measurements to a mathematical combination of seven base units. The science of measurement is pursued in the field of [[metrology]].\n\n[[File:Measuring Tape Inch+CM.jpg|thumb|300px|A typical [[tape measure]] with both [[Metric system|Metric]] and [[Imperial units|Imperial]] units and two [[Us penny|US pennies]] for comparison]]\n\n==Methodology==\nThe measurement of a property may be categorized by the following criteria: [[level of measurement|type]], [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], [[units of measurement|unit]], and [[uncertainty]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} They enable unambiguous comparisons between measurements.\n\n* The ''type'' or ''level'' of measurement is a taxonomy for the methodological character of a comparison. For example, two states of a property may be compared by ratio, difference, or ordinal preference. The type is commonly not explicitly expressed, but implicit in the definition of a measurement procedure. \n* The ''magnitude'' is the numerical value of the characterization, usually obtained with a suitably chosen [[measuring instrument]]. \n* A ''unit'' assigns a mathematical weighting factor to the magnitude that is derived as a ratio to the property of an artifact used as standard or a natural physical quantity. \n* An ''uncertainty'' represents the [[observational error|random and systemic error]]s of the measurement procedure; it indicates a confidence level in the measurement. Errors are evaluated by methodically repeating measurements and considering the [[accuracy and precision]] of the measuring instrument.\n\n==Standardization of measurement units==\nMeasurements most commonly use the [[International System of Units]] (SI) as a comparison framework. The system defines seven [[SI base units|fundamental units]]: [[kilogram]], [[metre]], [[candela]], [[second]], [[ampere]], [[kelvin]], and [[mole (unit)|mole]]. Six of these units are defined without reference to a particular physical object which serves as a standard (artifact-free), with the exception of the [[kilogram]] which is still embodied in an artifact which rests at the [[BIPM]] outside Paris.\n\nArtifact-free definitions fix measurements at an exact value related to a [[physical constant]] or other invariable phenomena in nature, in contrast to standard artifacts which are subject to deterioration or destruction. Instead, the measurement unit can only ever change through increased accuracy in determining the value of the constant it is tied to.\n[[File:SI base unit.svg|thumb|right|250px|The seven base units in the SI system. Arrows point from units to those that depend on them.]]\nThe first proposal to tie an [[SI base unit]] to an experimental standard independent of fiat was by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839\u20131914),<ref>{{harvnb|Crease|2011|pp=182\u20134}}</ref> who proposed to define the [[metre]] in terms of the [[wavelength]] of a [[spectral line]].<ref>C.S. Peirce (July 1879) \"Note on the Progress of Experiments for Comparing a Wave-length with a Metre\" ''American Journal of Science'', as referenced by {{harvnb|Crease|2011|p=203 }}</ref> This directly influenced the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]]; Michelson and Morley cite Peirce, and improve on his method.<ref>{{harvnb|Crease|2011|p=203}}</ref>\n\n===Standards===\nWith the exception of a few fundamental [[quantum]] constants, units of measurement are derived from historical agreements. Nothing inherent in nature dictates that an [[inch]] has to be a certain length, nor that a [[mile]] is a better measure of distance than a [[kilometre]]. Over the course of human history, however, first for convenience and then for necessity, standards of measurement evolved so that communities would have certain common benchmarks. [[Law]]s regulating measurement were originally developed to prevent [[fraud]] in commerce.\n\nUnits of measurement are generally defined on a scientific basis, overseen by governmental or independent agencies, and established in international treaties, pre-eminent of which is the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM), established in 1875 by the [[Metre Convention|Treaty of the metre]] and which oversees the [[International System of Units]] (SI) and which has custody of the [[Kilogram#International prototype kilogram|International Prototype Kilogram]].  The metre, for example, was redefined in 1983 by the CGPM as the distance traveled by light in free space in 1\u2044299,792,458 of a second while in 1960 the international yard was defined by the governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and South Africa as being ''exactly'' 0.9144 metres.\n\nIn the [[United States]], the National Institute of Standards and Technology ([[NIST]]), a division of the [[United States Department of Commerce]], regulates commercial measurements. In the United Kingdom, the role is performed by the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] (NPL), in Australia by the [[National Measurement Institute, Australia|National Measurement Institute]],<ref>http://www.measurement.gov.au/Pages/about.aspx</ref> in South Africa by the [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]] and in India the [[National Physical Laboratory of India]].\n\n==Units and systems==\n{{Main|Units of measurement|Systems of measurement}}\n[[Image:MetricImperialUSCustomaryUnits.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[baby bottle]] that measures in three [[Units of measurement|measurement systems]], [[Imperial unit|Imperial (U.K.)]], [[United States customary units|U.S. customary]], and [[metric system|metric]].]]\n[[Image:FourMetricInstruments.JPG|thumb|upright|Four measuring devices having metric calibrations]]\n\n===Imperial and US Customary systems===\n{{Main|Imperial and US customary measurement systems}}    \nBefore [[SI unit]]s were widely adopted around the world, the British systems of [[English unit]]s and later [[imperial unit]]s were used in Britain, the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and the United States.  The system came to be known as [[U.S. customary units]] in the United States and is still in use there and in a few [[Caribbean]] countries.  These various systems of measurement have at times been called ''foot-pound-second'' systems after the Imperial units for length, weight and time even though the tons, hundredweights, gallons, and nautical miles, for example, are different for the U.S. units.  Many Imperial units remain in use in Britain, which has officially switched to the SI system&mdash;with a few exceptions such as road signs, which are still in miles. Draught beer and cider must be sold by the imperial pint, and milk in returnable bottles can be sold by the imperial pint. Many people measure their height in feet and inches and their weight in [[Stone (imperial mass)|stone]] and pounds, to give just a few examples. Imperial units are used in many other places, for example, in many Commonwealth countries that are considered metricated, land area is measured in acres and floor space in square feet, particularly for commercial transactions (rather than government statistics). Similarly, gasoline is sold by the gallon in many countries that are considered metricated.\n\n===Metric system===\n{{main|Metric system|History of the metric system|Introduction to the metric system}}\nThe [[metric system]] is a decimal [[systems of measurement]] based on its units for length, the [[metre]] and for mass, the [[kilogram]]. It exists in several variations, with different choices of [[Units of measurement#Base and derived units|base units]], though these do not affect its day-to-day use. Since the 1960s, the [[International System of Units]] (SI) is the internationally recognised metric system. Metric units of mass, length, and electricity are widely used around the world for both everyday and scientific purposes.\n\nThe metric system features a single base unit for many physical quantities. Other quantities are derived from the standard SI units.  Multiples and fractions of the units are expressed as [[Powers of 10]] of each unit. Unit conversions are always simple because they are in the ratio of ten, one hundred, one thousand, etc., so that convenient magnitudes for measurements are achieved by simply moving the decimal place: 1.234 metres is 1234 millimetres or 0.001234 kilometres. The use of [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], such as 2/5 of a metre, is not prohibited, but uncommon. All lengths and distances, for example, are measured in metres, or thousandths of a metre (millimetres), or thousands of metres (kilometres). There is no profusion of different units with different conversion factors as in the Imperial system which uses, for example, [[inch]]es, feet, [[yard]]s, [[fathom]]s, [[Rod (unit)|rods]].\n\n===International System of Units===\nThe [[International System of Units]] (abbreviated as SI from the [[French language]] name ''Syst\u00e8me International d'Unit\u00e9s'') is the modern revision of the [[metric system]]. It is the world's most widely used [[system of units]], both in everyday [[commerce]] and in [[science]]. The SI was developed in 1960 from the metre-kilogram-[[second]] (MKS) system, rather than the [[centimetre gram second system of units|centimetre-gram-second]] (CGS) system, which, in turn, had many variants. During its development the SI also introduced several newly named units that were previously not a part of the metric system. The original SI units for the seven basic physical quantities were:<ref>{{SIbrochure8th|page = 147}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Base quantity\n! Base unit\n! Symbol\n!

Base units are the simple measurements for time, length, mass, temperature, amount of substance, electric current and light intensity.  Derived units are constructed from the base units, for example, the [[Watt]], i.e. the unit for power, is defined from the base units as m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7kg\u00b7s<sup>\u22123</sup>. Other physical properties may be measured in compound units, such as material density, measured in kg/m<sup>3</sup>.\n\n====Converting prefixes====\nThe SI allows easy multiplication when switching among units having the same base but different prefixes. To convert from metres to centimetres it is only necessary to multiply the number of metres by 100, since there are 100 centimetres in a metre. Inversely, to switch from centimetres to metres one multiplies the number of centimetres by 0.01 or divide centimetres by 100.\n\n===Length===\n[[Image:CarpentersRule.png|thumb|right|A 2-metre carpenter's [[ruler]]]]\n{{See also|List of length, distance, or range measuring devices}}\n\nA [[ruler]] or rule is a tool used in, for example, [[geometry]], [[technical drawing]], engineering, and carpentry, to measure lengths or distances or to draw straight lines.  Strictly speaking, the ''ruler'' is the instrument used to '''rule''' straight lines and the calibrated instrument used for determining length is called a ''measure'', however common usage calls both instruments ''rulers'' and the special name ''straightedge'' is used for an unmarked rule.  The use of the word ''measure'', in the sense of a measuring instrument, only survives in the phrase ''tape measure'', an instrument that can be used to measure but cannot be used to draw straight lines.  As can be seen in the photographs on this page, a two-metre carpenter's rule can be folded down to a length of only 20 centimetres, to easily fit in a pocket, and a five-metre-long tape measure easily retracts to fit within a small housing.\n\n===Some special names===\nSome non-systematic names are applied for some multiples of some units.\n* 100 kilograms = 1 quintal; 1000 kilogram = 1 metric tonne;\n* 10 years = 1 decade; 100 years = 1 century; 1000 years = 1 millennium\n\n===Building trades===\nThe Australian building trades adopted the [[metric system]] in 1966 and the units used for measurement of length are [[metres]] (m) and [[millimetres]] (mm).  [[Centimetres]] (cm) are avoided as they cause confusion when reading [[plans]]. For example, the length two and a half metres is usually recorded as 2500&nbsp;mm or 2.5&nbsp;m; it would be considered non-standard to record this length as 250&nbsp;cm.<ref>{{cite web\n|title = What is metrication\n|url = http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/WhatIsMetrication.pdf\n|first1 = Pat\n|last1 = Naughtin\n|year = 2007\n|publisher = Pat Naugthin\n|accessdate = 13 June 2013\n|pages = 4, 5}}</ref>\n\n===Surveyor's Trade===\nAmerican surveyors use a decimal-based system of measurement devised by [[Edmund Gunter]] in 1620. The base unit is [[Gunter's chain]] of {{convert|66|ft|m}} which is subdivided into 4 rods, each of 16.5&nbsp;ft or 100 links of 0.66&nbsp;feet.  A link is abbreviated \"lk,\"  and links \"lks\" in old deeds and land surveys done for the government.\n\n===Time===\n{{Main|Time}}\n\nTime is an abstract measurement of elemental changes over a non spatial continuum.  It is denoted by numbers and/or named periods such as [[hour]]s, [[day]]s, [[week]]s, [[month]]s and [[year]]s. It is an apparently irreversible series of occurrences within this non spatial continuum.  It is also used to denote an interval between two relative points on this continuum.\n\n===Mass===\n{{Main|Weighing scale}}\n\n''Mass'' refers to the intrinsic property of all material objects to resist changes in their momentum.  ''Weight'', on the other hand, refers to the downward force produced when a mass is in a gravitational field.  In [[free fall]], (no net gravitational forces) objects lack weight but retain their mass.  The Imperial units of mass include the [[ounce]], [[pound (mass)|pound]], and [[ton]].  The metric units [[gram]] and kilogram are units of mass.\n\nOne device for measuring weight or mass is called a weighing scale or, often, simply a ''scale''.  A spring scale measures force but not mass, a balance compares weight, both require a gravitational field to operate.  Some of the most accurate instruments for measuring weight or mass are based on load cells with a digital read-out, but require a gravitational field to function and would not work in free fall.\n\n===Economics===\n{{Main|Measurement in economics}}\nThe measures used in economics are physical measures, [[nominal price]] value measures and [[real price]] measures. These measures differ from one another by the variables they measure and by the variables excluded from measurements.\n\n==Difficulties==\nSince accurate measurement is essential in many fields, and since all measurements are necessarily approximations, a great deal of effort must be taken to make measurements as accurate as possible. For example, consider the [[History of timekeeping devices|problem of measuring the time]] it takes an object to fall a distance of one metre (about 39&nbsp;[[Inch|in]]).  Using physics, it can be shown that, in the gravitational field of the Earth, it should take any object about 0.45 second to fall one metre. However, the following are just some of the sources of [[measurement uncertainty|error]] that arise:\n* This computation used for the [[acceleration of gravity]] {{convert|9.8|m/s2}}. But this measurement is not exact, but only precise to two significant digits.\n* The Earth's gravitational field varies slightly depending on height above sea level and other factors.\n* The computation of .45 seconds involved extracting a [[square root]], a [[mathematical operation]] that required rounding off to some number of significant digits, in this case two significant digits.\n\nAdditionally, other sources of [[experimental error]] include:\n* carelessness,\n* determining of the exact time at which the object is released and the exact time it hits the ground,  \n* measurement of the height and the measurement of the time both involve some error,\n* [[Air resistance]].\n\nScientific experiments must be carried out with great care to eliminate as much error as possible, and to keep error estimates realistic.\n\n==Definitions and theories==\n\n===Classical definition===\nIn the classical definition, which is standard throughout the physical sciences, ''measurement'' is the determination or estimation of ratios of quantities.<ref name=\"Michell, J. 1999\">Michell, J. (1999). Measurement in psychology: a critical history of a methodological concept. New York: Cambridge University Press.</ref> Quantity and measurement are mutually defined: quantitative attributes are those possible to measure, at least in principle. The classical concept of quantity can be traced back to [[John Wallis]] and [[Isaac Newton]], and was foreshadowed in [[Euclid's Elements]].<ref name=\"Michell, J. 1999\"/>\n\n===Representational theory===\nIn the representational theory, ''measurement'' is defined as \"the correlation of numbers with entities that are not numbers\".<ref>Ernest Nagel: \"Measurement\", Erkenntnis, Volume 2, Number 1 / December 1931, pp.&nbsp;313\u2013335, published by [[Axel Springer AG|Springer]], the Netherlands</ref> The most technically elaborate form of representational theory is also known as [[additive conjoint measurement]]. In this form of representational theory, numbers are assigned based on correspondences or similarities between the structure of number systems and the structure of qualitative systems. A property is quantitative if such structural similarities can be established. In weaker forms of representational theory, such as that implicit within the work of [[Stanley Smith Stevens]],<ref>Stevens, S.S. ''On the theory of scales and measurement'' 1946. Science. 103, 677-680.</ref> numbers need only be assigned according to a rule.\n\nThe concept of measurement is often misunderstood as merely the assignment of a value, but it is possible to assign a value in a way that is not a measurement in terms of the requirements of additive conjoint measurement.  One may assign a value to a person's height, but unless it can be established that there is a correlation between measurements of height and empirical relations, it is not a measurement according to additive conjoint measurement theory. Likewise, computing and assigning arbitrary values, like the \"book value\" of an asset in accounting, is not a measurement because it does not satisfy the necessary criteria.\n\n===Information theory===\n[[Information theory]] recognises that all data are inexact and statistical in nature.  Thus the definition of measurement is: \"A set of observations that reduce uncertainty where the result is expressed as a quantity.\"<ref>Douglas Hubbard: \"How to Measure Anything\", Wiley (2007), p. 21</ref>  This definition is implied in what scientists actually do when they measure something and report both the [[mean]] and [[statistics]] of the measurements.  In practical terms, one begins with an initial guess as to the expected value of a quantity, and then, using various methods and instruments, reduces the uncertainty in the value.  Note that in this view, unlike the [[positivist]] representational theory, all measurements are uncertain, so instead of assigning one value, a range of values is assigned to a measurement.  This also implies that there is not a clear or neat distinction between [[Approximation|estimation]] and measurement.\n\n===Quantum mechanics===\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], a measurement is an action that determines a particular property (position, momentum, energy, etc.) of a quantum system. Before a measurement is made, a quantum system is simultaneously described by all values in a [[spectrum]], or [[range (mathematics)|range]], of possible values, where the probability of measuring each value is determined by the [[wavefunction]] of the system. When a measurement is performed, the wavefunction of the quantum system \"[[wavefunction collapse|collapses]]\" to a single, definite value.<ref>{{cite book | last = Penrose | first = Roger | title = The road to reality : a complete guide to the laws of the universe | publisher = Vintage Books | location = New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-679-77631-4 }} \"The jumping of the quantum state to one of the eigenstates of '''Q''' is the process referred to as ''state-vector reduction'' or ''collapse of the wavefunction''.
