Examples are [[electron]]s, [[ion]]s and [[electron hole|holes]].  In a conducting medium, an [[electric field]] can exert force on these free particles, causing a net motion of the particles through the medium; this is what constitutes an [[electric current]].  In different conducting media, different particles serve to carry charge:\n\n*In [[metal]]s, the charge carriers are [[electron]]s.  One or two of the [[valence electron]]s from each atom is able to move about freely within the [[crystal structure]] of the metal.  The free electrons are referred to as [[conduction band|conduction electron]]s, and the cloud of free electrons is called a [[Fermi gas]].\n*In [[electrolyte]]s, such as [[Saline water|salt water]], the charge carriers are [[ion]]s, atoms or molecules that have gained or lost electrons so they are electrically charged.  Atoms that have gained electrons so they are negatively charged are called [[anion]]s, atoms that have lost electrons so they are positively charged are called [[cation]]s.  Cations and anions of the dissociated liquid also serve as charge carriers in melted [[ionic compound|ionic solid]]s (see e.g. the [[Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process]] for an example of electrolysis of a melted ionic solid.) [[Proton conductor]]s are electrolytic conductors employing positive hydrogen ions as carriers.\n*In a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], an electrically charged gas which is found in [[electric arc]]s through air, [[neon sign]]s, and the sun and stars, the electrons and cations of ionized gas act as charge carriers.\n*In a [[vacuum]], free electrons can act as charge carriers.  These are sometimes called [[cathode ray]]s.  In a [[vacuum tube]], the mobile electron cloud is generated by a heated metal [[cathode]], by a process called [[thermionic emission]].\n*In [[semiconductor]]s (the material used to make electronic components like [[transistor]]s and [[integrated circuit]]s),  in addition to electrons, the travelling vacancies in the [[valence band|valence-band electron]] population (called \"[[electron hole|holes]]\"), act as mobile positive charges and are treated as charge carriers.  Electrons and holes are the charge carriers in semiconductors.\n\nIt can be seen that in some conductors, such as ionic solutions and plasmas, there are both positive and negative charge carriers, so an electric current in them consists of the two polarities of carrier moving in opposite directions.  In other conductors, such as metals, there are only charge carriers of one polarity, so an electric current in them just consists of charge carriers moving in one direction.\n\n==Charge carriers in semiconductors==\nThere are two recognized types of charge carriers in [[semiconductor]]s. One is [[electron]]s, which carry a negative [[electric charge]]. In addition, it is convenient to treat the traveling vacancies in the [[valence band]] electron population ([[electron hole|holes]]) as the second type of charge carrier, which carry a positive charge equal in magnitude to that of an electron.\n\n===Carrier generation and recombination===\n{{main|Carrier generation and recombination}}\nWhen an electron meets with a hole, they [[carrier generation and recombination|recombine]] and these free carriers effectively vanish. The energy released can be either thermal, heating up the semiconductor (''thermal recombination'', one of the sources of waste heat in semiconductors), or released as [[photon]]s (''optical recombination'', used in [[light-emitting diode|LEDs]] and [[laser diode|semiconductor laser]]s). The recombination means an electron which has been excited from the valence band to the conduction band falls back to the empty state in the valence band, known as the holes. The holes are the empty state created in the valence band when an electron gets excited after getting some energy to overpass the energy gap.\n\n=== Majority and minority carriers ===\nThe more abundant charge carriers are called '''majority carriers''', which are primarily responsible for [[current (electricity)|current]] transport in a piece of semiconductor. In [[n-type semiconductor]]s they are electrons, while in [[p-type semiconductor]]s they are holes. The less abundant charge carriers are called '''minority carriers'''; in n-type semiconductors they are holes, while in p-type semiconductors they are electrons.\n\nIn an [[intrinsic semiconductor]], which does not contain any impurity, the concentrations of both types of carriers are ideally equal.  If an intrinsic semiconductor is [[doping (semiconductor)|doped]] with a donor impurity then the majority carriers are electrons; if the semiconductor is doped with an acceptor impurity then the majority carriers are holes.\n\nMinority carriers play an important role in [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar transistors]] and [[solar cell]]s. Their role in [[field-effect transistor]]s (FETs) is a bit more complex: for example, a [[MOSFET]] has both p-type and n-type regions. The transistor action involves the majority carriers of the [[field-effect transistor|source]] and [[Field-effect transistor|drain]] regions, but these carriers traverse the [[field-effect transistor|body]] of the opposite type, where they are minority carriers. However, the traversing carriers hugely outnumber their opposite type in the transfer region (in fact, the opposite type carriers are removed by an applied electric field that creates an [[Inversion layer (semiconductors)|inversion layer]]), so conventionally the source and drain designation for the carriers is adopted, and FETs are called \"majority carrier\" devices.\n\n===Free carrier concentration===\n\n''Free carrier concentration'' is the [[concentration]] of free carriers in a [[doping (semiconductor)|doped semiconductor]].  It is similar to the carrier concentration in a metal and for the purposes of calculating currents or drift velocities can be used in the same way.  Free carriers are electrons (or [[electron hole|holes]]) which have been introduced directly into the [[conduction band]] (or [[valence band]]) by doping and are not promoted thermally.  For this reason electrons (holes) will not act as double carriers by leaving behind holes (electrons) in the other band. so in other words, charge carriers are particles/electrons that are free to move. (carry the charge). they get charged at the battery/cell, and then flow throughout the circuit, giving energy to any components in the way, then when out of charge and towards the end of the circuit, they get re-charged by the battery/cell.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Carrier lifetime]]\n*[[Color charge]]\n*[[Molecular diffusion]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Charge Carrier}}\n[[Category:Particle physics]]\n[[Category:Charge carriers]]"}]}}}}
