Accessed August 11, 2011. \"Without any fanfare, the world's first working robot joined the assembly line at the General Motors plant in Ewing Township in the spring of 1961.... It was an automated die-casting mold that dropped red-hot door handles and other such car parts into pools of cooling liquid on a line that moved them along to workers for trimming and buffing. Its most distinct feature was a grip on a steel armature that eliminated the need for a man to touch car parts just made from molten steel.\"</ref>\n\nIt was invented by [[George Devol]] in the 1950s using his original patent filed in 1954 and granted in 1961 ({{US Patent|2,988,237}}). The patent begins:\n<blockquote>The present invention relates to the automatic operation of machinery, particularly the handling apparatus, and to automatic control apparatus suited for such machinery.<ref name=Rosen>Rosen, Rebecca J.
