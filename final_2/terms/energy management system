In these respects, the terminology EMS then excludes the monitoring and control functions, but more specifically refers to the collective suite of power network applications and to the generation control and scheduling applications.\n\nManufacturers of EMS also commonly supply a corresponding [[dispatcher training simulator]] (DTS). This related technology makes use of components of SCADA and EMS as a training tool for control centre operators. It is also possible to acquire an independent DTS from a non-EMS source such as [[EPRI]]\n\nEnergy management systems are also often commonly used by individual commercial entities to monitor, measure, and control their electrical building loads. Energy management systems can be used to centrally control devices like HVAC units and lighting systems across multiple locations, such as retail, grocery and restaurant sites. Energy management systems can also provide metering, submetering, and monitoring functions that allow facility and building managers to gather data and insight that allows them to make more informed decisions about energy activities across their sites.\n\n==Operating systems==\nUp to the early 1990 it was common to find EMS systems being delivered based on proprietary [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[operating system]]s. Back then EMS suppliers such as [[Harris Corporation|Harris Controls]] (now [[General Electric|GE]]), [[Hitachi]], [[Cebyc]], [[Control Data Corporation]], [[Siemens]] and [[Toshiba]] manufactured their own proprietary hardware. EMS suppliers that did not manufacture their own hardware often relied on products developed by [[Digital Equipment]], [[Gould Electronics]] and [[MODCOMP]]. The VAX 11/780 from Digital Equipment was a popular choice amongst some EMS suppliers. EMS systems now rely on a model based approach. Traditional planning models and EMS models were always independently maintained and seldom in synchronism with each other. Using EMS software allows planners and operators to share a common model reducing the mismatch between the two and cutting model maintenance by half. Having a common user interface also allows for easier transition of information from planning to operations.\n\nAs proprietary systems became uneconomical, EMS suppliers began to deliver solutions based on industry standard hardware platforms such as those from [[Digital Equipment]] (later [[Compaq]]), [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]] and [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]]. The common operating system then was either DEC [[OpenVMS]] or UNIX. By 2004, various EMS suppliers including [[Alstom]], [[ABB Asea Brown Boveri|ABB]] and [[Open Systems International|OSI]] had begun to offer Windows based solutions. By 2006 customers had a choice of [[UNIX]], [[Linux]] or [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based systems. Some suppliers including NARI, PSI-CNI and Siemens continue to offer UNIX-based solutions. It is now common for suppliers to integrate UNIX-based solutions on either the Sun [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] or IBM platform. Newer EMS systems based on [[blade server]]s occupy a fraction of the space previously required. For instance, a blade rack of 20 servers occupy much the same space as that previously occupied by a single [[MicroVAX]] server.\n\n==Other meanings==\n\n=== Energy efficiency ===\nIn a slightly different context, EMS can also refer to a system designed to achieve energy efficiency through process optimization by reporting on granular energy use by individual pieces of equipment. Newer, cloud-based energy management systems provide the ability to remotely control [[HVAC]] and other energy-consuming equipment; gather detailed, real-time data for each piece of equipment; and generate intelligent, specific, real-time guidance on finding and capturing the most compelling savings opportunities.\n\n===Automated control of building energy===\n{{Main|Building Management System}}\n\nThe term Energy Management System can also refer to a computer system which is designed specifically for the automated control and monitoring of those electromechanical facilities in a building which yield significant energy consumption such as heating, ventilation and lighting installations. The scope may span from a single building to a group of buildings such as university campuses, office buildings, retail stores networks or factories. Most of these energy management systems also provide facilities for the reading of electricity, gas and water meters. The data obtained from these can then be used to perform self-diagnostic and optimization routines on a frequent basis and to produce trend analysis and annual consumption forecasts.\n==Manufacturing industry energy management ==\nAny type of company responsible for the manufacturing of any type of product (hardware or software) consumes a large portion of total world energy. Energy management works under the following guideline:{{fact|date=February 2016}}\n\n# '''Plan''' - data acquisition, processing and documentation, energy target and objective, energy management and action plan\n# '''Do''' - resources ,raising awareness and training ,communication, documentation, operation control \n# '''Check''' - monitoring document, corrective and preventive action, planning and record, internal audit \n# '''Act'''- management review\n\n==See also==\n* [[Energy accounting]]\n* [[Energy conservation measure]]\n* [[Energy management]]\n* [[Energy management software]], software to monitor and optimize energy consumption in buildings or communities\n* [[Energy Storage as a Service (ESaaS)]]\n* [[Load management]] for balancing the supply of electricity on a distribution network.\n\n==References==\n* EPRI (2005) Advanced Control Room Energy Management System: Requirements and Implementation Guidance.
