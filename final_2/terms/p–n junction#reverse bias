The circuit symbol is shown: the triangle corresponds to the p side.]]\n\nA '''p\u2013n junction''' is a boundary or interface between two types of semiconductor material, [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] and [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]], inside a single crystal of [[semiconductors|semiconductor]]. The \"p\" (positive) side contains an excess of [[electron hole|holes]], while the \"n\" (negative) side contains an excess of [[electron]]s. The p-n junction is created by [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]], for example by [[ion implantation]], [[diffusion]] of [[dopant]]s, or by [[epitaxy]] (growing a layer of crystal doped with one type of dopant on top of a layer of crystal doped with another type of dopant). If two separate pieces of material were used, this would introduce a [[grain boundary]] between the semiconductors that would severely inhibit its utility by [[scattering]] the electrons and [[Electron hole|holes]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\np\u2013n junctions are elementary \"building blocks\" of most [[Semiconductor device|semiconductor electronic devices]] such as [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s, [[solar cell]]s, [[LEDs]], and [[integrated circuit]]s; they are the active sites where the electronic action of the device takes place. For example, a common type of [[transistor]], the [[bipolar junction transistor]], consists of two p\u2013n junctions in series, in the form n\u2013p\u2013n or p\u2013n\u2013p.\n\nThe invention of the p\u2013n junction is usually attributed to American physicist [[Russell Ohl]] of [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]].<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Riordan\n | first = Michael\n | author2 = Lillian Hoddeson\n | title = Crystal fire: the invention of the transistor and the birth of the information age\n | publisher = W.

A p-doped semiconductor is relatively [[Electrical conductivity|conductive]]. The same is true of an n-doped semiconductor, but the junction between them can become [[depletion region|depleted]] of charge carriers, and hence non-conductive, depending on the relative voltages of the two semiconductor regions. By manipulating this non-conductive layer, p\u2013n junctions are commonly used as [[diode]]s: circuit elements that allow a flow of [[electricity]] in one direction but not in the other (opposite) direction. ''Bias'' is the application of a voltage across a p\u2013n junction; ''[[forward bias]]'' is in the direction of easy current flow, and ''[[reverse bias]]'' is in the direction of little or no current flow.\n\n=== Equilibrium (zero bias) ===\n\nIn a p\u2013n junction, without an external applied voltage, an equilibrium condition is reached in which a potential difference is formed across the junction. This potential difference is called built-in potential <math>V_{\\rm bi}</math>.\n\nAfter joining p-type and n-type semiconductors, electrons from the n region near the p\u2013n interface tend to diffuse into the p region leaving behind positively charged ions in the n region and being recombined with holes, forming negatively charged ions in the p region. Likewise, holes from the p-type region near the p\u2013n interface begin to diffuse into the n-type region, leaving behind negatively charged ions in the p region and recombining with electrons, forming positive ions in the n region. The regions near the p\u2013n interface lose their neutrality and most of their mobile carriers, forming the [[space charge region]] or [[depletion layer]] (see [[:Image:Pn-junction-equilibrium.png|figure A]]).\n\n[[File:Pn-junction-equilibrium.png|400px|left|thumb|'''Figure A.''' A p\u2013n junction in thermal equilibrium with zero-bias voltage applied. Electron and hole concentration are reported with blue and red lines, respectively. Gray regions are charge-neutral. Light-red zone is positively charged. Light-blue zone is negatively charged. The electric field is shown on the bottom, the electrostatic force on electrons and holes and the direction in which the diffusion tends to move electrons and holes. (The log concentration curves should actually be smoother with slope varying with field strength.)]]\n\nThe [[electric field]] created by the space charge region opposes the diffusion process for both electrons and holes. There are two concurrent phenomena: the diffusion process that tends to generate more space charge, and the electric field generated by the space charge that tends to counteract the diffusion. The carrier concentration profile at equilibrium is shown in [[:Image:Pn-junction-equilibrium.png|figure A]] with blue and red lines. Also shown are the two counterbalancing phenomena that establish equilibrium.\n\n[[File:Pn-junction-equilibrium-graphs.png|400px|right|thumb|'''Figure B.''' A p\u2013n junction in thermal equilibrium with zero-bias voltage applied. Under the junction, plots for the charge density, the electric field, and the voltage are reported. (The log concentration curves should actually be smoother, like the voltage.)]]\n\nThe [[space charge region]] is a zone with a net charge provided by the fixed ions ([[donor (semiconductors)|donors]] or [[acceptor (semiconductors)|acceptors]]) that have been left ''uncovered'' by [[majority carrier]] diffusion. When equilibrium is reached, the charge density is approximated by the displayed step function. In fact, since the y-axis of figure A is log-scale, the region is almost completely depleted of majority carriers (leaving a charge density equal to the net doping level), and the edge between the space charge region and the neutral region is quite sharp (see [[:Image:Pn-junction-equilibrium-graphs.png|figure B]], Q(x) graph). The space charge region has the same magnitude of charge on both sides of the p\u2013n interfaces, thus it extends farther on the less doped side in this example (the n side in figures A and B).\n\n=== Forward bias ===\n\nIn forward bias, the p-type is connected with the positive terminal and the n-type is connected with the negative terminal.[[File:PN band.gif|thumb|400px|right|PN junction operation in forward-bias mode, showing reducing depletion width. The panels show '''energy band diagram''', '''electric field''', and '''net charge density'''. Both p and n junctions are doped at a 1e15/cm3 (0.00016C/cm<sup>3</sup>) doping level, leading to built-in potential of ~0.59&nbsp;V. Reducing depletion width can be inferred from the shrinking charge profile, as fewer dopants are exposed with increasing forward bias. Observe the different [[Quasi Fermi level|quasi-fermi levels]] for conduction band and valence band in n and p regions (red curves)]]\n\nWith a battery connected this way, the [[Electron hole|holes]] in the p-type region and the [[electrons]] in the n-type region are pushed toward the junction and start to neutralize the depletion zone, reducing its width. The positive potential applied to the p-type material repels the holes, while the negative potential applied to the n-type material repels the electrons. The change in [[electrical potential|potential]] between the p side and the n side decreases or switches sign. With increasing forward-bias voltage, the depletion zone eventually becomes thin enough that the zone's electric field cannot counteract charge carrier motion across the p\u2013n junction, which as a consequence reduces electrical resistance. The electrons that cross the p\u2013n junction into the p-type material (or holes that cross into the n-type material) will diffuse into the nearby neutral region. The amount of minority diffusion in the near-neutral zones determines the amount of current that may flow through the diode.\n\nOnly [[majority carriers]] (electrons in n-type material or holes in p-type) can flow through a semiconductor for a macroscopic length. With this in mind, consider the flow of electrons across the junction. The forward bias causes a force on the electrons pushing them from the N side toward the P side. With forward bias, the depletion region is narrow enough that electrons can cross the junction and ''inject'' into the p-type material. However, they do not continue to flow through the p-type material indefinitely, because it is energetically favorable for them to recombine with holes. The average length an electron travels through the p-type material before recombining is called the ''diffusion length'', and it is typically on the order of [[micrometers]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Solid State Physics |last=Hook |first=J. R. |author2=H. E. Hall |year=2001 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=0-471-92805-4 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough the electrons penetrate only a short distance into the p-type material, the electric current continues uninterrupted, because holes (the majority carriers) begin to flow in the opposite direction. The total current (the sum of the electron and hole currents) is constant in space, because any variation would cause charge buildup over time (this is [[Kirchhoff's current law]]). The flow of holes from the p-type region into the n-type region is exactly analogous to the flow of electrons from N to P (electrons and holes swap roles and the signs of all currents and voltages are reversed).\n\nTherefore, the macroscopic picture of the current flow through the diode involves electrons flowing through the n-type region toward the junction, holes flowing through the p-type region in the opposite direction toward the junction, and the two species of carriers constantly recombining in the vicinity of the junction. The electrons and holes travel in opposite directions, but they also have opposite charges, so the overall current is in the same direction on both sides of the diode, as required.\n\nThe [[Shockley diode equation]] models the forward-bias operational characteristics of a p\u2013n junction outside the avalanche (reverse-biased conducting) region.\n\n=== Reverse bias ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Photodiode]] -->\n[[File:PN Junction in Reverse Bias.png|thumb|right|300 px|A silicon p\u2013n junction in reverse bias.]]\n\nConnecting the ''p-type'' region to the ''negative'' terminal of the battery and the ''n-type'' region to the ''positive'' terminal corresponds to reverse bias. If a diode is reverse-biased, the voltage at the [[cathode]] is comparatively higher than at the [[anode]]. Therefore, very little current will flow until the diode breaks down. The connections are illustrated in the adjacent diagram.\n\nBecause the p-type material is now connected to the negative terminal of the power supply, the '[[Electron hole|holes]]' in the p-type material are pulled away from the junction, leaving behind charged ions and causing the width of the [[depletion region]] to increase. Likewise, because the n-type region is connected to the positive terminal, the electrons will also be pulled away from the junction, with similar effect. This increases the voltage barrier causing a high resistance to the flow of charge carriers, thus allowing minimal electric current to cross the p\u2013n junction. The increase in resistance of the p\u2013n junction results in the junction behaving as an insulator.\n\nThe strength of the depletion zone electric field increases as the reverse-bias voltage increases. Once the electric field intensity increases beyond a critical level, the p\u2013n junction depletion zone breaks down and current begins to flow, usually by either the [[Zener breakdown|Zener]] or the [[avalanche breakdown]] processes. Both of these breakdown processes are non-destructive and are reversible, as long as the amount of current flowing does not reach levels that cause the semiconductor material to overheat and cause thermal damage.\n\nThis effect is used to advantage in [[Zener diode]] regulator circuits. Zener diodes have a low breakdown voltage. A standard value for breakdown voltage is for instance 5.6&nbsp;V. This means that the voltage at the cathode cannot be more than about 5.6&nbsp;V higher than the voltage at the anode (although there is a slight rise with current), because the diode will break down \u2013 and therefore conduct \u2013 if the voltage gets any higher. This in effect limits the voltage over the diode.\n\nAnother application of reverse biasing is [[Varicap]] diodes, where the width of the [[depletion zone]] (controlled with the reverse bias voltage) changes the capacitance of the diode.\n\n== Governing equations ==\n\n=== Size of depletion region ===\n{{see also|Band bending}}\n\nFor a p\u2013n junction, letting <math> C_A(x) </math> and <math> C_D(x) </math> be the concentrations of acceptor and donor atoms respectively, and letting <math>N_0(x) </math> and <math>P_0(x) </math> be the equilibrium concentrations of electrons and holes respectively, yields, by Poisson's equation:\n\n<math>-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 V}{\\mathrm{d}x^2}=\\frac{\\rho }{\\varepsilon }=\\frac{q}{\\varepsilon }\\left[ (N_0-P_0)+(C_D-C_A)\\right]</math>\n\nwhere <math>V</math> is the [[electric potential]], <math>\\rho </math> is the [[charge density]], <math>\\varepsilon </math> is [[permittivity]] and\n<math>q</math> is the magnitude of the electron charge.

To see how it can be derived, we must examine the various reasons for current. The convention is that the forward (+) direction be pointed against the diode's built-in potential gradient at equilibrium.\n*Forward Current (<math>\\mathbf{J}_F</math>)\n**Diffusion Current: current due to local imbalances in carrier concentration <math>n</math>, via the equation <math>\\mathbf{J}_D\\propto-q\\nabla n</math>\n*Reverse Current (<math>\\mathbf{J}_R</math>)\n**Field Current\n**Generation Current\n\n== Summary ==\n\nThe forward-bias and the reverse-bias properties of the p\u2013n junction imply that it can be used as a [[diode]]. A p\u2013n junction diode allows electric charges to flow in one direction, but not in the opposite direction; negative charges (electrons) can easily flow through the junction from n to p but not from p to n, and the reverse is true for holes. When the p\u2013n junction is forward-biased, electric charge flows freely due to reduced resistance of the p\u2013n junction. When the p\u2013n junction is reverse-biased, however, the junction barrier (and therefore resistance) becomes greater and charge flow is minimal.\n\n== Non-rectifying junctions ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}\n\nIn the above diagrams, contact between the metal wires and the semiconductor material also creates [[metal\u2013semiconductor junction]]s called [[Schottky diode]]s. In a simplified ideal situation a semiconductor diode would never function, since it would be composed of several diodes connected back-to-front in series. But, in practice, surface impurities within the part of the semiconductor that touches the metal terminals will greatly reduce the width of those depletion layers to such an extent that the metal-semiconductor junctions do not act as diodes. These ''[[non-rectifying junction]]s'' behave as [[ohmic contact]]s regardless of applied voltage polarity.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|PN-junction diagrams}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Alloy-junction transistor]]\n* [[Capacitance\u2013voltage profiling]]\n* [[Deep-level transient spectroscopy]]\n* [[Delocalized electron]]\n* [[Diode modelling]]\n* [[Field-effect transistor]]\n* [[n\u2013p\u2013n transistor]]\n* [[p\u2013n\u2013p transistor]]\n* [[Semiconductor detector]]\n* [[Semiconductor device]]\n* [[Transistor\u2013transistor logic]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* {{cite journal |last1=Shockley |first1=William |year=1949 |title=The Theory of p-n Junctions in Semiconductors and p-n Junction Transistors |journal=Bell System Technical Journal |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=435\u2013489 |doi=10.1002/j.1538-7305.1949.tb03645.x}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* V.
