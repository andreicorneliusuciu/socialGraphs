It is also known as '''power-line carrier''', '''power-line digital subscriber line''' (PDSL), '''mains communication''', '''power-line telecommunications''', or '''power-line networking''' (PLN).\n\nA wide range of power-line communication technologies are needed for different applications, ranging from [[home automation]] to [[Internet access]] which is often called [[broadband over power lines]] (BPL). Most PLC technologies limit themselves to one type of wire (such as premises wiring within a single building), but some can cross between two levels (for example, both the distribution network and premises wiring).  Typically transformers prevent propagating the signal, which requires multiple technologies to form very large networks. Various data rates and frequencies are used in different situations.\n\nA number of difficult technical problems are common between [[wireless]] and power-line communication, notably those of [[spread spectrum]] radio signals operating in a crowded environment. Radio interference, for example, has long been a concern of [[amateur radio]] groups.<ref name=\"notch\">{{Cite news |title= ARRL Strengthens the Case for Mandatory BPL Notching |url= http://www.arrl.org/news/arrl-strengthens-the-case-for-mandatory-bpl-notching |date= 2 December 2010 |work= News release |publisher= [[American Amateur Radio League]] |accessdate= 24 November 2011 }}</ref>\n[[File:Devolo dLAN650.JPG|thumb|''dLAN650'', contemporary power-line communication adapter from [[devolo]] with additional power connector and a [[transfer rate]] of up to 600 Mbit/s<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.devolo.com/de/Produkte/dLAN-650+ | title=dLAN\u00ae 650+ | publisher=devolo | accessdate=9 April 2014}}</ref> \u2013 with connected [[LAN cable]]]]\n\n==History==\n{{update|date=November 2016}}\nNarrowband power-line communications began soon after electrical power supply became widespread.

See [[IEC 61334]]. It is a simple low cost system with a long history, however it has a very slow transmission rate, between 200 and 800 bits per second. In the 1970s, the Tokyo Electric Power Co ran experiments which reported successful bi-directional operation with several hundred units.<ref>{{cite conference|first=M|last=Hosono|title=Improved Automatic meter reading and load control system and its operational achievement|conference=4th International Conference on Metering, Apparatus and Tariffs for Electricity Supply|pages=90\u201394|date=26\u201328 October 1982|publisher=IEE}}</ref>\n\nSince the mid-1980s, there has been a surge of interest in using the potential of digital communications techniques and [[digital signal processing]]. The drive is to produce a reliable system which is cheap enough to be widely installed and able to compete cost effectively with wireless solutions. But the narrowband powerline communications channel presents many technical challenges, a mathematical channel model and a survey of work is available.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=D.|author2=Jeans, T.|title=Narrowband, low data rate communications on the low-voltage mains in the CENELEC frequencies.

It can be a means of extending an existing network into new places without adding new wires.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/how-to/home-networking-part-7-power-line-connections-explained/|title=Home networking explained, part 7: Power line connections|website=CNET|access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref>\n\nFor example, a computer could be wired to  a router as follows: an adapter is connected to a router of an existing wired [[Local area network|local-area network]], via its [[Port (computer networking)|network port]]. A second adapter is connected to an Ethernet-ready device like a computer. When both adapters are plugged into their wall sockets they will have a network connection via the electrical wiring in between the two wall sockets being used.<ref name=\":1\" /> Some networking devices, such as routers or switches, also have power line connectivity built in. This adds no new wires since they need to be plugged into the wall to operate anyway.\n\nThe power line is transformed into a data line via the superposition of a low energy information signal to the power wave. Since electricity is 50 or 60&nbsp;Hz, data is transmitted at at least 3&nbsp;kHz to ensure that the power wave does not interfere with the data signal.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.telecomabc.com/p/plc.html|title=Powerline Communications (PLC) - Telecom ABC|website=www.telecomabc.com|access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref> A technical challenge is that, because the power wiring is unshielded and untwisted, the wiring acts as an antenna, so that the wiring emits radio energy, causing interference to the existing users of the same frequency band. The power lines can also act as receiving antennas, and receive interference from radio signals.<ref name=\":2\" /> In many jurisdictions such transmissions are illegal. The U.S. is an exception, permitting limited-power wide-band signals to be injected into unshielded wiring, as long as the wiring is not designed to propagate radio waves in free space.<ref name=\"BERGU13\">{{cite book|author1=Berger, Lars T.|author2=Schwager, Andreas |author3=Escudero Garz\u00e1s, J.

A one-way system might be lower-cost than a two-way system, but also is difficult to reconfigure should the operating environment change.\n\nIn a two-way system, commands can be broadcast out from the master station to end devices (meters) \u2013 allowing for reconfiguration of the network, or to obtain readings, or to convey messages, etc. This type of broadcast allows the communication system to simultaneously reach many thousands of devices\u2014all of which are known to have power, and have been previously identified as candidates for load shed.
