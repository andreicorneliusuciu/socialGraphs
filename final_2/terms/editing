As such, editing can involve creative skills, human relations and a precise set of methods.<ref>{{cite web|title=Encarta Dictionary definition of \"editing\"|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/editing.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwbaCYwg|archivedate=31 October 2009|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Encarta Dictionary definition of \"editor\"|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/editor.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwbaiWpi|archivedate=31 October 2009|deadurl=yes}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Editorial office of Bild newspaper, West Berlin, 1977.jpg|thumb|right|Editors work on producing an issue of ''[[Bild]]'', [[West Berlin]], 1977. Previous front pages are affixed to the wall behind them.]]\nThere are various editorial positions in publishing. Typically, one finds editorial assistants reporting to the senior-level editorial staff and directors who report to senior executive editors. Senior executive editors are responsible for developing a product for its final release. The smaller the publication, the more these roles overlap.\n\nThe top editor at many publications may be known as the [[chief editor]], [[executive editor]], or simply the editor. A frequent and highly regarded contributor to a [[magazine]] may acquire the title of editor-at-large or [[contributing editor]]. Mid-level newspaper editors often manage or help to manage sections, such as business, sports and features. In U.S. newspapers, the level below the top editor is usually the [[managing editor]].\n\nIn the book [[publishing]] industry, editors may organize [[Anthology|anthologies]] and other compilations, produce definitive editions of a classic author's works (scholarly editor), and organize and manage contributions to a multi-author book (symposium editor or volume editor). Obtaining manuscripts or recruiting authors is the role of an ''acquisitions editor'' or a ''[[commissioning editor]]'' in a publishing house.<ref name=\"PolandLouise\">Poland, Louise, The business, Craft and Profession of the Book Editor, in Carter, David, Galligan, Anne, (eds.), ''Making books: contemporary Australian publishing'', Queensland University Press, 2007, p. 100.</ref> Finding marketable ideas and presenting them to appropriate authors are the responsibilities of a sponsoring editor.\n\n[[copy editing|Copy editors]] correct [[spelling]], [[grammar]] and align writings to [[Style guide|house style]]. Changes to the [[publishing]] industry since the 1980s have resulted in nearly all copy editing of book manuscripts being outsourced to [[freelance]] copy editors.<ref name=\"PolandLouise\" />\n\nAt [[newspaper]]s and [[wire services]], copy editors write headlines and work on more substantive issues, such as ensuring accuracy, fairness, and taste. In some positions, they [[news design|design pages]] and select news stories for inclusion. At U.K. and Australian newspapers, the term is ''sub-editor''. They may choose the layout of the publication and communicate with the printer. These editors may have the title of ''[[News design|layout or design editor]]'' or (more so in the past) ''makeup editor''.\n\n==Scholarly books and journals==\nWithin the publishing environment, editors of scholarly books are of three main types, each with particular [[responsibilities]]:\n\n* ''Acquisitions editor'' (or ''commissioning editor'' in Britain), who contracts with the author to produce the copy\n* ''Project editor'' or ''production editor'', who sees the copy through its stages from manuscript to bound book and usually assumes most of the budget and schedule responsibilities\n* ''Copy editor'' or ''manuscript editor'', who prepares the copy for conversion into printed form.\n\nIn the case of multi-author [[edited volume]]s, before the manuscript is delivered to the publisher it has undergone substantive and linguistic editing by the volume's editor, who works independently of the publisher.\n\nAs for [[scholarly journal]]s, where spontaneous submissions are more common than commissioned works, the position of ''journal editor'' or [[editor-in-chief]] replaces the acquisitions editor of the book publishing environment, while the roles of production editor and copy editor remain. However, another editor is sometimes involved in the creation of scholarly research articles. Called the [[authors' editor]], this editor works with authors to get a manuscript fit for purpose before it is submitted to a scholarly journal for publication.\n\nThe primary difference between copy editing scholarly books and journals and other sorts of copy editing lies in applying the standards of the publisher to the copy. Most scholarly publishers have a preferred style that usually specifies a particular dictionary and style manual\u2014for example, ''[[the Chicago Manual of Style]]'', the ''[[MLA Style Manual]]'' or the [[APA style|''APA Publication Manual'']] in the US, or the [[New Hart's Rules]] in the U.K.\n\n==Technical editing==\n{{see also|Technical writing|Technical communication}}\nTechnical editing involves reviewing text written on a technical topic, identifying usage errors and ensuring adherence to a style guide.\n\nTechnical editing may include the correction of grammatical mistakes, misspellings, mistyping, incorrect punctuation, inconsistencies in usage, poorly structured sentences, wrong scientific terms, wrong units and dimensions, inconsistency in significant figures, technical ambivalence, technical disambiguation, statements conflicting with general scientific knowledge, correction of synopsis, content, index, headings and subheadings, correcting data and chart presentation in a research paper or report, and correcting errors in citations.\n\nLarge companies dedicate experienced writers to the technical editing function. Organizations that cannot afford dedicated editors typically have experienced writers peer-edit text produced by less experienced colleagues.\n\nIt helps if the technical editor is familiar with the subject being edited. The \"technical\" knowledge that an editor gains over time while working on a particular product or technology does give the editor an edge over another who has just started editing content related to that product or technology. But essential general skills are attention to detail, the ability to sustain focus while working through lengthy pieces of text on complex topics, tact in dealing with writers, and excellent communication skills.\n\n==Editing services==\n{{Redirect|Paid editing|paid editing on Wikipedia|Paid editing on Wikipedia}}\n\nEditing is a growing field of work in the [[service industry]]. '''Paid''' '''editing services''' may be provided by specialized editing firms or by self-employed ([[Freelancer|freelance]]) editors.\n\nEditing firms may employ a team of in-house editors, rely on a network of individual contractors or both.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Appiah|first=Bernard|title=Science editing at an Indian firm: perspectives of two US visitors|journal=Science Editing|year=2009|volume=32|issue=4|pages=118\u2013119|url=http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/files/scienceeditor/v32n4p118-119.pdf}}</ref> Such firms are able to handle editing in a wide range of topics and genres, depending on the skills of individual editors. The services provided by these editors may be varied and can include [[proofreading]], [[copy editing]], [[online editing]], [[developmental editing]], editing for [[search engine optimization]] (SEO), etc.\n\nSelf-employed editors work directly for clients (e.g., authors, publishers) or offer their services through editing firms, or both. They may specialize in a type of editing (e.g., copy editing) and in a particular subject area. Those who work directly for authors and develop professional relationships with them are called [[author editing|authors' editors]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Audio editing]]\n* [[Author editing]]\n* [[Film editing]]\n* [[Stealth edit]]\n* [[Textual scholarship]]\n* [[Video editing]]\n* [[Writer]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite news |last= Morrison|first=Blake |author-link=Blake Morrison |date=6 August 2005 |title= Black day for the blue pencil|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,1542959,00.html |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location= |publisher= |accessdate= }}\n*{{cite journal |last= Overholser |first= Geneva |date=December 1998 |title=Editor Inc. |url=http://ajrarchive.org/article.asp?id=3290 |journal= [[American Journalism Review]]|location= |publisher= |accessdate= }}\n* {{cite book\n |last1=Stephen\n |first1=Leslie\n |authorlink1=Leslie Stephen\n |title=Studies of a Biographer\n |url=//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Studies_of_a_Biographer\n |volume=1 |year=1898\n |publisher=Duckworth and Co.\n |location=London\n |pages=37\u201373 |chapter=The Evolution of Editors |chapterurl=//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Studies_of_a_Biographer/The_Evolution_of_Editors\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |last1=\u00d3 Br\u00f3g\u00e1in\n |first1=S\u00e9amas\n |title=A Dictionary of Editing\n |url=http://www.claritas.ie\n |volume=1 |year=2015\n |publisher=Claritas\n |location=Dublin\n}}\n* [http://www.roehampton.ac.uk/staff/Susan-Greenberg/ Greenberg, Susan L.] (2015) [http://www.roehampton.ac.uk/staff/Susan-Greenberg/ ''Editors talk about editing:'' ''insights for readers, writers and publishers''], New York: Peter Lang\n\n==External links==\n{{Library resources box\n|by=no\n|onlinebooks=no\n|others=no\n|about=yes\n|label=Editing}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n* {{Commons category-inline}}\n\n{{Book Publishing Process}}\n{{Journalism roles}}\n{{Journalism}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Journalism occupations]]\n[[Category:Media occupations]]\n[[Category:Editors| ]]\n[[Category:Editing| ]]\n\n[[ar:\u062a\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0631]]"}]}}}}
