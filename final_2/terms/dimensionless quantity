Numerous well-known quantities, such as [[pi|{{pi}}]], [[Euler's number|{{mvar|e}}]], and [[Golden ratio|{{mvar|\u03c6}}]], are dimensionless. By contrast, examples of quantities with dimensions are [[length]], [[time]], and [[speed]], which are measured in dimensional units, such as [[metre]], [[second]] and metre/second.\n\nDimensionless quantities are often obtained as [[product (mathematics)|products]] or [[ratio]]s of [[quantity|quantities]] that are not dimensionless, but whose dimensions cancel out in the mathematical operation. An example of such a ratio is [[engineering strain]], a measure of physical deformation. It is defined as a change in length divided by the initial length. Since both quantities have the dimension ''length'', their ratio is dimensionless. Another example is [[alcohol by volume]], which characterizes the concentration of [[ethanol]] in an [[alcoholic beverage]].\n\n== Properties ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}\nAll pure numbers are dimensionless. A dimensionless quantity may have dimensionless [[Units of measurement|units]], even though it has no physical dimension associated with it.  For example, to show the quantity being measured, for example [[mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]] or [[mole fraction]], it is sometimes helpful to use the same units in both the numerator and denominator ([[kilogram|kg]]/kg or [[mole (unit)|mol]]/mol). The quantity may also be given as a ratio of two different units that have the same dimension (for instance, [[light year]]s over [[metre]]s). This may be the case when calculating [[slope]]s in graphs, or when making unit conversions. Such notation does not indicate the presence of physical dimensions, and is purely a notational convention. Other common dimensionless units are percentages [[%]]&nbsp;(=&nbsp;0.01), &nbsp;[[per mil|\u2030]]&nbsp;(=&nbsp;0.001); [[parts-per notation]] ppm (=&nbsp;10<sup>\u22126</sup>), ppb (=&nbsp;10<sup>\u22129</sup>), ppt (=&nbsp;10<sup>\u221212</sup>); angle units ([[degree (angle)|degrees]], [[radians]], [[gradian|grad]]); [[dalton (unit)|dalton]] and [[mole (unit)|mole]]. Units of number such as the [[dozen]], [[Gross (unit)|gross]], and [[googol]] are also dimensionless.\n\nWhen a quantity is the ratio of two other quantities, each of the same dimension, the defined quantity is dimensionless and has the same value regardless of the units used to calculate the two composing quantities. For instance, if body '''A''' exerts a [[force]] of magnitude ''F'' on body '''B''', and '''B''' exerts a force of magnitude ''f'' on '''A''', then the ratio ''F''/''f'' is always equal to [[Newton's Third Law of Motion|1]], regardless of the actual units used to measure ''F'' and ''f''. This is a fundamental property of dimensionless proportions and follows from the assumption that the [[laws of physics]] are independent of the system of units used in their expression. In this case, if the ratio ''F''/''f'' was not always equal to 1, but changed if one switched from [[SI]] to [[CGS]], that would mean that [[Newton's Third Law]]'s truth or falsity would depend on the system of units used, which would contradict this fundamental hypothesis. This assumption that the laws of physics are not contingent upon a specific unit system is the basis for the [[Buckingham \u03c0 theorem]], as discussed in a later section.\n\n== Examples ==\nDimensionless quantities are used for many purposes.\n=== Mathematics ===\nSeveral examples from mathematics include proportions, angles, and special numbers.  A simple problem illustrates how a proportion may be a dimensionless quantity. Sarah says, \"Out of every 10 apples I gather, 1&nbsp;is rotten.\" The rotten-to-gathered ratio is (1&nbsp;apple)&nbsp;/&nbsp;(10&nbsp;apples) =&nbsp;0.1 =&nbsp;10%, which is a dimensionless quantity.  Similarly, angles may be defined as a proportion. The [[Angle|radian measure of angles]] is the ratio of the length of a circle's arc subtended by an angle whose vertex is the centre of the circle to some other length. The ratio\u2014i.e.,&nbsp;length divided by length\u2014is dimensionless. When using [[radian]]s as the unit, the length that is compared is the length of the [[radius]] of the circle. When using [[degree (angle)|degree]] as the units, the arc's length is compared to 1/360 of the [[circumference]] of the circle.  In the case of the dimensionless quantity \u03c0, being the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, the number would be constant regardless of what unit is used to measure a circle's circumference and diameter (e.g.,&nbsp;centimetres, miles, [[light-year]]s, etc.), as long as the same unit is used for both.  Additionally, the golden ratio, [[Golden ratio|{{mvar|\u03c6}}]], is simply the ratio of length of the two sides of a [[golden rectangle]].  In [[statistics]] the [[coefficient of variation]] is the ratio of the [[standard deviation]] to the [[average|mean]] and is used to measure the [[Statistical dispersion|dispersion]] in the [[statistical data|data]].\n\n=== Dimensionless physical constants ===\n{{main|Dimensionless physical constant}}\nCertain fundamental physical constants, such as the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum, the [[universal gravitational constant]], [[Planck's constant]] and [[Boltzmann's constant]] can be normalized to 1 if appropriate units for [[time]], [[length]], [[mass]], [[electric charge|charge]], and [[temperature]] are chosen. The resulting [[system of units]] is known as the [[natural units]]. However, not all [[physical constant]]s can be normalized in this fashion. For example, the values of the following constants are independent of the system of units and must be determined experimentally:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/constants.html |title=How Many Fundamental Constants Are There? |last1=Baez |first1=John |date=April 22, 2011 |website= |publisher= |access-date=October 7, 2015 |quote=}}</ref>\n* \u03b1 \u2248 1/137.036, the [[fine structure constant]] which is the [[coupling constant]] for the [[electromagnetic interaction]];\n* \u03b2 (or \u03bc) \u2248 1836, the [[proton-to-electron mass ratio]].

In the nineteenth century, [[French people|French]] mathematician [[Joseph Fourier]] and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] lead significant developments in the modern concepts of [[dimension]] and [[unit (measurement)|unit]].  Later work by [[British people|British]] physicists [[Osborne Reynolds]] and [[Lord Rayleigh]] contributed to the understanding of dimensionless numbers in physics.  Building on Rayleigh's method of dimensional analysis, [[Edgar Buckingham]] proved the [[Buckingham \u03c0 theorem|\u03c0 theorem]] (independent of French mathematician [[Joseph Bertrand]]'s previous work) to formalize the nature of these quantities.  Numerous other dimensionless numbers, mostly ratios, were coined in the early 1900s,  particularly in the areas of [[fluid mechanics]] and [[heat transfer]]. Measuring ''ratios'' in the (derived) unit ''dB'' ([[decibel]]) finds widespread use nowadays.  In the early [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] discussed naming the unit of 1 as the 'uno', but the idea of just introducing a new SI-name for '''1''' was dropped.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.fr/utils/common/pdf/CCU15.pdf|title=BIPM Consultative Committee for Units (CCU), 15th Meeting|date=17\u201318 April 2003|accessdate=2010-01-22}}{{deadlink|date=October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.fr/utils/common/pdf/CCU16.pdf|title=BIPM Consultative Committee for Units (CCU), 16th Meeting|accessdate=2010-01-22}}{{deadlink|date=October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Dybkaer, Ren\u00e9 |title=An ontology on property for physical, chemical, and biological systems |journal=APMIS Suppl. |issue=117 |pages=1\u2013210 |year=2004 |pmid=15588029 |url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/ci/2005/2703/bw1_dybkaer.html}}</ref>\n\n=== Buckingham \u03c0 theorem ===\nThe [[Buckingham \u03c0 theorem]] indicates that validity of the laws of physics does not depend on a specific unit system. A statement of this theorem is that any physical law can be expressed as an [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]] involving only dimensionless combinations (ratios or products) of the variables linked by the law (e. g., pressure and volume are linked by [[Boyle's Law]] \u2013 they are inversely proportional). If the dimensionless combinations' values changed with the systems of units, then the equation would not be an identity, and Buckingham's theorem would not hold.\n\nAnother consequence of the [[Buckingham \u03c0 theorem]] of [[dimensional analysis]] is that the [[Function (mathematics)|functional]] dependence between a certain number (say, ''n'') of [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] can be reduced by the number (say, ''k'') of [[independent variable|independent]] [[dimension]]s occurring in those variables to give a set of ''p'' = ''n'' \u2212 ''k'' independent, dimensionless [[quantity|quantities]]. For the purposes of the experimenter, different systems that share the same description by dimensionless [[quantity]] are equivalent.\n\n==== Example ====\nTo demonstrate the application of the \u03c0 theorem, consider the [[electric power|power]] consumption of a [[stirrer]] with a given shape.\nThe power, ''P'', in dimensions [M \u00b7 L<sup>2</sup>/T<sup>3</sup>], is a function of the [[density]], ''\u03c1'' [M/L<sup>3</sup>], and the [[viscosity]] of the fluid to be stirred, ''\u03bc'' [M/(L \u00b7 T)], as well as the size of the stirrer given by its [[diameter]], ''D'' [L], and the [[Angular velocity|angular speed]] of the stirrer, ''n'' [1/T]. Therefore, we have a total of ''n'' = 5 variables representing our example.  Those ''n'' = 5 variables are built up from ''k'' = 3 fundamental dimensions, the length: L ([[SI]] units: [[meters|m]]), time: T ([[second|s]]), and mass: M ([[kilograms|kg]]).\n\nAccording to the \u03c0-theorem, the ''n'' = 5 variables can be reduced by the ''k'' = 3 dimensions to form ''p'' = ''n'' \u2212 ''k'' = 5 \u2212 3 = 2 independent dimensionless numbers. These quantities are <math>\\mathrm{Re} = {\\frac{\\rho n D^2}{\\mu}}</math>, commonly named the [[Reynolds number]] which describes the fluid flow regime, and <math>N_\\mathrm{p} = \\frac{P}{\\rho n^{3} D^{5}}</math>, the [[Power number]], which is the dimensionless description of the stirrer.\n\n=== Nondimensionalization of differential equations ===\n\nThe process of [[nondimensionalization]] has significant applications in the analysis of differential equations.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of dimensionless quantities]]\n* [[Similitude (model)]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)]]\n* [[Dimensional analysis]]\n* [[Normalization (statistics)]] and [[standardized moment]], the analogous concepts in [[statistics]]\n* [[Buckingham \u03c0 theorem]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:Physical constants]]\n[[Category:Dimensionless numbers| ]]"}]}}}}
