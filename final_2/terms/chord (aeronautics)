The ''chord length'' is the distance between the trailing edge and the point on the leading edge where the chord intersects the leading edge.<ref name=Clancy5.2>Clancy, L.J.

The chord of a wing, stabilizer and propeller is determined by measuring the distance between leading and trailing edges in the direction of the airflow.  (If a wing has a rectangular [[planform (aeronautics)|planform]], rather than tapered or swept, then the chord is simply the width of the wing measured in the direction of airflow.)  The term ''chord'' is also applied to the width of [[Flap (aircraft)|wing flaps]], [[ailerons]] and [[rudder]] on an aircraft.\n\nThe term is also applied to aerofoils in [[gas turbine]] engines such as [[turbojet]], [[turboprop]], or [[turbofan]] engines for aircraft propulsion.\n\nMost wings are not rectangular so they have a different '''chord''' at different positions along their [[Wingspan|span]].  To give a characteristic figure that can be compared among various wing shapes, the ''mean aerodynamic chord'', or ''MAC'', is used. The MAC is somewhat more complex to calculate, because most wings vary in '''chord''' over the span, growing narrower towards the outer tips. This means that more [[lift (force)|lift]] is generated on the wider inner portions, and the MAC moves the point to measure the chord to take this into account.\n\n==Standard mean chord==\nStandard mean chord (SMC) is defined as wing area divided by wing span:{{citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\n:<math>\\mbox{SMC} = \\frac{S}{b},</math>\n\nwhere ''S'' is the wing area and ''b'' is the span of the wing. Thus, the SMC is the chord of a rectangular wing with the same area and span as those of the given wing. This is a purely geometric figure and is rarely used in [[aerodynamics]].\n\n==Mean aerodynamic chord==\nMean aerodynamic chord (MAC) is defined as:<ref>Abbott, I.H., and Von Doenhoff, A.E. (1959), ''Theory of Wing Sections'', Section 1.4 (page 27), Dover Publications Inc., New York, Standard Book Number 486-60586-8</ref>\n\n:<math>\\mbox{MAC} = \\frac{2}{S}</math><math>\\int_{0}^{\\frac{b}{2}}c^2 dy,</math>\n\nwhere ''y'' is the coordinate along the wing span and ''c'' is the chord at the coordinate ''y''. Other terms are as for SMC.\n\nThe MAC is a two-dimensional representation of the whole wing. The pressure distribution over the entire wing can be reduced to a single lift force on and a moment around the [[aerodynamic center]] of the MAC. Therefore, not only the length but also the position of MAC is often important. In particular, the position of [[center of mass]] (CoM) of an aircraft is usually measured relative to the MAC, as the percentage of the distance from the leading edge of MAC to CoM with respect to MAC itself.\n\nNote that the figure to the right implies that the MAC occurs at a point where leading or trailing edge sweep changes. In general, this is not the case. Any shape other than a simple trapezoid requires evaluation of the above integral.\n\nThe ratio of the length (or ''span'') of a rectangular-planform wing to its chord is known as the [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]], an important indicator of the [[lift-induced drag]] the wing will create.<ref>Kermode, A.C. (1972), ''Mechanics of Flight'', Chapter 3, (p.103, eighth edition), Pitman Publishing Limited, London ISBN 0-273-31623-0</ref> (For wings with planforms that are not rectangular, the aspect ratio is calculated as the square of the span divided by the wing planform area.) Wings with higher aspect ratios will have less induced drag than wings with lower aspect ratios. Induced drag is most significant at low airspeeds. This is why [[Glider aircraft|glider]]s have long slender wings.\n\n==Tapered wing==\nKnowing the area (S<sub>w</sub>), taper ratio (<math>\\lambda</math>) and the span (b) of the wing, and whether the wing has sweep or not, the chord at any position on the span can be calculated by the formula:<ref>Ruggeri, M.C., (2009), ''Aerodin\u00e1mica Te\u00f3rica'', Apuntes de la materia, UTN-FRH, Haedo, Buenos Aires</ref>\n\n:<math>c(y)=\\frac{2\\,S_w}{(1+\\lambda)b}\\left[1-\\frac{2(1-\\lambda)}{b}|y|\\right],</math>\nwhere\n\n<math>\\lambda=\\frac{C_{\\rm Tip}}{C_{\\rm Root}}</math>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ae.su.oz.au/aero/contents.html Aerodynamics for Students]\n* [http://www.airfieldmodels.com/information_source/math_and_science_of_model_aircraft/formulas/mean_aerodynamic_chord.htm Finding the Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC)]\n* [http://www.aviarus-21.com/cg-calc?lang=en Image based Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC) calculator]\n* [http://aircraftcomponent.net/taper-ratio.html Engineer Considerations]\n\n[[Category:Aerospace engineering]]\n[[Category:Aircraft wing design]]"}]}}}}
