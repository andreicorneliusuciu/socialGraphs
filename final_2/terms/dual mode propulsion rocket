Dual mode systems are either [[hydrazine]]/[[nitrogen tetroxide]], or [[monomethylhydrazine]]/[[hydrogen peroxide]] (the former is much more common). Typically, this system works as follows: During the initial high-[[Impulse (physics)|impulse]] [[orbit]]-[[orbit raising|raising]] maneuvers, the system operates in a bipropellant fashion, providing high [[thrust]] at high efficiency; when it arrives on orbit, it closes off either the [[fuel]] or [[oxidizer]], and conducts the remainder of its mission in a simple, predictable monopropellant fashion.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Propulsion system]]\n* [[Spacecraft propulsion]]\n\n==External links==\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dual Mode Propulsion Rocket}}\n[[Category:Rocket propulsion]]\n\n\n{{Rocket-stub}}"}]}}}}
