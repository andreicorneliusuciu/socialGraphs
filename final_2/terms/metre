In 1799, it was redefined in terms of a prototype metre bar (the actual bar used was changed in 1889 and 1927). In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms of a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of [[krypton-86]]. In 1983, the current definition was adopted.\n\nThe imperial [[inch]] is defined as 0.0254 metres (2.54 centimetres or 25.4 millimetres). One metre is about {{frac|3|3|8}} inches longer than a yard, i.e. about {{frac|39|3|8}} inches.\n\n== Spelling ==\n''Metre'' is the standard spelling of the metric unit for length in nearly all English-speaking nations except the United States<ref>The most recent official brochure about the International System of Units (SI), written in French by the ''{{lang|fr|Bureau international des poids et mesures}}'', [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) uses the spelling ''metre''; an English translation, included to make the SI standard \"more widely accessible\" also uses the spelling ''metre''.([[#bipm2006|BIPM, 2006]], p. 130''ff'') However, in 2008 the U.S. English translation published by the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) chose to use the spelling ''meter'' in accordance with the United States Government Printing Office Style Manual. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 gives the Secretary of Commerce of the US the responsibility of interpreting or modifying the SI for use in the US. The Secretary of Commerce delegated this authority to the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology ([[#turner|Turner]]). In 2008, NIST published the US version ([[#taylor2008a|Taylor and Thompson, 2008a]]) of the English text of the eighth edition of the BIPM publication ''{{lang|fr|Le Syst\u00e8me international d'unit\u00e9s}} (SI)'' (BIPM, 2006). In the NIST publication, the spellings \"meter\", \"liter\" and \"deka\" are used rather than \"metre\", \"litre\" and \"deca\" as in the original BIPM English text ([[#taylor2008a|Taylor and Thompson (2008a), p. iii]]). The Director of the NIST officially recognised this publication, together with [[#taylor2008b|Taylor and Thompson (2008b)]], as the \"legal interpretation\" of the SI for the United States ([[#turner|Turner]]). Thus, the spelling ''metre'' is referred to as the \"international spelling\"; the spelling ''meter'', as the \"American spelling\".</ref> and the Philippines,<ref>The Philippines uses [[Philippine English|English]] as an official language and this largely follows American English since the country became a colony of the United States.

This range of uses is also found in Latin (''metior'', ''mensura''), French (''m\u00e8tre'', ''mesure''), English and other languages.  The motto ''\u039c\u0395\u03a4\u03a1\u03a9 \u03a7\u03a1\u03a9'' (metro chro) in the seal of the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM), which was a saying of the Greek statesman and philosopher [[Pittacus of Mytilene]] and may be translated as \"Use measure!\", thus calls for both measurement and moderation.\n\n== History of definition ==\n{{Main article|History of the metre}}\n\nIn 1668 the English cleric and philosopher [[John Wilkins]] proposed in an essay a decimal-based unit of length, the ''universal measure'' or ''standard'' based on a pendulum with a one-second [[Pendulum#Period of oscillation|period]].<ref name=\"Wilkins2007\">An Essay Towards a Real Character, and A Philosophical Language \u2014 John Wilkins F.R.S. 1668, pp191-192</ref>  In 1670 [[Gabriel Mouton]], Bishop of Lyon, also suggested a universal length standard with decimal multiples and divisions, to be based on a one-minute angle of the Earth's meridian arc or (as the Earth's circumference was not easy to measure) on a pendulum with a one-second period. In 1675, the Italian scientist [[Tito Livio Burattini]], in his work ''{{lang|it|Misura Universale}}'', used the phrase ''{{lang|it|metro cattolico}}'' (\"universal measure\"), derived from the Greek {{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd|\u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd]] [[wikt:\u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2|\u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd]]}} (''m\u00e9tron katholik\u00f3n''), to denote the standard unit of length derived from a pendulum.<ref>{{cite journal | author = George Sarton | title = The First Explanation of Decimal Fractions and Measures (1585).

On 7 October 1790 that commission advised the adoption of a decimal system, and on 19 March 1791 advised the adoption of the term ''m\u00e8tre'' (\"measure\"), a basic unit of length, which they defined as equal to one ten-millionth of the distance between the [[North Pole]] and the [[Equator]],<ref>('decimalization is not of the essence of the metric system; the real significance of this is that it was the first great attempt to define terrestrial units of measure in terms of an unvarying astronomical or geodetic constant.)

Present Henri Tresca, George Matthey, Saint-Claire Deville and Debray]]\n\n=== Pendular ===\nIn 1668, Wilkins proposed using [[Christopher Wren]]'s suggestion of defining the metre using a [[pendulum]] with a length which produced a half-[[Frequency|period]] of one [[second]], known as a '[[seconds pendulum]]'. [[Christiaan Huygens]] had observed that length to be 38 [[Akker|Rijnland inches]] or 39.26 [[Inch#Modern standardisation|English inch]]es. This is the equivalent of what is now known to be 997{{nbsp}}mm.<ref name=\"Wilkins2007\"/> No official action was taken regarding this suggestion.\n\n=== Meridional ===\nIn the 18th century, there were two approaches to the definition of the standard unit of length. One favoured Wilkins approach: to define the metre in terms of the length of a pendulum which produced a half-period of one second. The other approach was to define the metre as one ten-millionth ({{sfrac|10 000 000}}) of the length of a [[Circular sector|quadrant]] along the [[Earth]]'s [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]; that is, the distance from the [[Equator]] to the [[North Pole]]. This means that the quadrant (a section/distance {{frac|1|4}} of the Earth's circumference) would have been defined as exactly 10 000 000 metres (10 000&nbsp;km) at that time, with the total circumference of the Earth defined as 40 000 000 metres (40 000&nbsp;km). In 1791, the [[French Academy of Sciences]] selected the meridional definition over the pendular definition because the force of [[Gravitation|gravity]] [[Geoid|varies slightly]] over the surface of the Earth, which affects the period of a pendulum.\n\nTo establish a universally accepted foundation for the definition of the metre, more accurate measurements of this meridian were needed. The French Academy of Sciences commissioned an expedition led by [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre]] and [[Pierre M\u00e9chain]], lasting from 1792 to 1799, which attempted to accurately measure the distance between a belfry in [[Dunkirk|Dunkerque]] and [[Montju\u00efc castle]] in [[Barcelona]] to estimate the length of the [[meridian arc]] through Dunkerque. This portion of the meridian, assumed to be the same length as the [[Paris meridian]], was to serve as the basis for the length of the half meridian connecting the North Pole with the Equator. The problem with this approach is that the exact shape of the Earth is not a simple mathematical shape, such as a [[sphere]] or [[oblate spheroid]], at the level of precision required for defining a standard of length. The irregular and particular shape of the Earth smoothed to sea level is called a [[geoid]], which literally means \"Earth-shaped\", but does not correspond to the actual shape of the earth, but rather is a mathematical model of its shape. Despite these issues, in 1793 France adopted this definition of the metre as its official unit of length based on provisional results from this expedition.\n\n=== Prototype metre bar ===\nIn the 1870s and in light of modern precision, a series of international conferences was held to devise new metric standards. The [[Metre Convention]] (''Convention du M\u00e8tre'') of 1875 mandated the establishment of a permanent [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM: ''{{lang|fr|Bureau International des Poids et Mesures}}'') to be located in [[S\u00e8vres]], France. This new organisation was to construct and preserve a prototype metre bar, distribute national metric prototypes, and maintain comparisons between them and non-metric measurement standards. The organisation created such a bar in 1889 at the first [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM: ''{{lang|fr|Conf\u00e9rence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Poids et Mesures}}''), establishing the ''[[International Prototype Metre]]'' as the distance between two lines on a standard bar composed of an alloy of 90% [[platinum]] and 10% [[iridium]], measured at the melting point of ice.<ref>[[#nistmetre|National Institute of Standards and Technology 2003; Historical context of the SI: Unit of length (meter)]]</ref>\n\nHowever, it was later determined that the first [[International Prototype Metre|prototype metre bar]] was short by about 200 micrometres because of miscalculation of the [[flattening]] of the Earth, making the prototype about 0.02% shorter than the original proposed definition of the metre. Regardless, this length became the standard. The original international prototype of the metre is still kept at the BIPM under the conditions specified in 1889.\n\n=== Number of wavelengths of red-orange emission line of krypton-86 ===\nIn 1893, the standard metre was first measured with an [[interferometer]] by [[Albert Abraham Michelson|Albert A. Michelson]], the inventor of the device and an advocate of using some particular [[wavelength]] of [[light]] as a standard of length. By 1925, [[interferometry]] was in regular use at the BIPM. However, the International Prototype Metre remained the standard until 1960, when the eleventh CGPM defined the metre in the new [[International System of Units]] (SI) as equal to 1 650 763.73 [[wavelength]]s of the [[orange (colour)|orange]]-[[red]] [[emission line]] in the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] of the [[krypton]]-86 [[atom]] in a [[vacuum]].<ref name=\"Marion\">{{cite book |last=Marion |first=Jerry B. |title=Physics For Science and Engineering |year=1982 |publisher=CBS College Publishing |isbn=4-8337-0098-0 |page=3}}</ref>\n\n=== Distance travelled by light in a specified time ===\nTo further reduce uncertainty, the 17th CGPM in 1983 replaced the definition of the metre with its current definition, thus fixing the length of the metre in terms of the [[second]] and the [[speed of light]]:\n\n::The metre is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/{{val|fmt=spaces|299792458}} of a second.<ref name=\"Res1\" />\n\nThis definition fixed the speed of light in [[vacuum]] at exactly {{val|fmt=spaces|299792458}} metres per second (\u2248300 000&nbsp;km/s). An intended by-product of the 17th CGPM's definition was that it enabled scientists to compare lasers accurately using frequency, resulting in wavelengths with one-fifth the uncertainty involved in the direct comparison of wavelengths, because interferometer errors were eliminated. To further facilitate reproducibility from lab to lab, the 17th CGPM also made the iodine-stabilised [[helium\u2013neon laser]] \"a recommended radiation\" for realising the metre.<ref name=\"recommendations-2\" /> For the purpose of delineating the metre, the BIPM currently considers the HeNe laser wavelength, {{nowrap|\u03bb{{sub|HeNe}}}}, to be {{val|fmt=spaces| 632.99121258}} nm with an estimated relative standard uncertainty (''U'') of {{val|2.1|e=-11}}.<ref name=\"recommendations-2\" /><ref name=\"uncertainty\">The term \"relative standard uncertainty\" is explained by NIST on their web site: {{cite web |title=Standard Uncertainty and Relative Standard Uncertainty |work=The NIST Reference on constants, units, and uncertainties: Fundamental physical constants |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Info/Constants/definitions.html |publisher=NIST |accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref><ref>[[#NRC2010|National Research Council 2010]]</ref> This uncertainty is currently one limiting factor in laboratory realisations of the metre, and it is several orders of magnitude poorer than that of the second, based upon the caesium fountain [[atomic clock]] ({{nowrap|1=''U'' = {{val|5|e=-16}}}}).<ref>[[#NIST2011|National Institute of Standards and Technology 2011.]]</ref> Consequently, a  realisation of the metre is usually delineated (not defined) today in labs as {{val|fmt=spaces|1579800.762042|(33)}} wavelengths of helium-neon laser light in a vacuum, the error stated being only that of frequency determination.<ref name=\"recommendations-2\">{{cite web |title=Iodine ({{lambda}}\u2248633 nm) |publisher=BIPM |url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/mep/M-e-P_I2_633.pdf |work=MEP (''Mise en Pratique'') |year=2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=16 December 2011}}</ref> This bracket notation expressing the error is explained in the article on [[Standard uncertainty#Measurements|measurement uncertainty]].\n\nPractical realisation of the metre is subject to uncertainties in characterising the medium, to various uncertainties of interferometry, and to uncertainties in measuring the frequency of the source.<ref name=\"Beers2\" /> A commonly used medium is air, and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) has set up an online calculator to convert wavelengths in vacuum to wavelengths in air.<ref name=\"NIST_calculator\">The formulas used in the calculator and the documentation behind them are found at {{cite web |url=http://emtoolbox.nist.gov/Wavelength/Documentation.asp |title=Engineering metrology toolbox: Refractive index of air calculator |date=September 23, 2010 |publisher=NIST |accessdate=16 December 2011}} The choice is offered to use either the [http://emtoolbox.nist.gov/Wavelength/Edlen.asp modified Edl\u00e9n equation] or the [http://emtoolbox.nist.gov/Wavelength/Ciddor.asp Ciddor equation].
