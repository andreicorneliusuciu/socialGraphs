Wedges have been around for thousands of years, they were first made of simple stone. A hand axe is made by chipping stone, generally [[flint]], to form a bifacial edge, or wedge.  A wedge is a simple machine that transforms lateral force and movement of the tool into a transverse splitting force and movement of the workpiece.  The available power is limited by the effort of the person using the tool, but because power is the product of force and movement, the wedge amplifies the force by reducing the movement.  This amplification, or [[mechanical advantage]] is the ratio of the input speed to output speed.  For a wedge this is given by 1/tan\u03b1, where \u03b1 is the tip angle.  The faces of a wedge are modeled as straight lines to form a sliding or [[prismatic joint]].\n\nThe origin of the wedge is not known. In [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[quarry|quarries]], [[bronze]] wedges were used to break away blocks of stone used in construction. [[Wood]]en wedges that swelled after being saturated with water, were also used. Some [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] used [[antler]] wedges for splitting and working wood to make [[canoes]], dwellings and other objects.\n\n==Use of a wedge for lifting and separating==\nWedges are used to lift heavy objects, separating them from the surface upon which they rest.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=m5DK0FSuqysC&pg=PA321&lpg=PA321&dq=\u201cKinematic+Synthesis,\u201d+Formal+Engineering+Design+Synthesis&source=bl&ots=AZKlvmnPcA&sig=xe0EeLgCy8v4OIdZ_SnbK8igdrc&hl=en&ei=qcbVTsyEKo6FsAL1vsCRDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CEYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false  J. M. McCarthy and Leo Joskowitz, \u201cKinematic Synthesis,\u201d Formal Engineering Design Synthesis, (J. Cagan and E. Antonson, eds.), Cambridge Univ. Press, 2002.]</ref>\n\nConsider a block that is to be lifted by a wedge.  As the wedge slides under the block, the block slides up the sloped side of a wedge.  This lifts the weight F<sub>B</sub> of the block.  The horizontal force F<sub>A</sub> needed to lift the block is obtained by considering the velocity of the wedge v<sub>A</sub> and the velocity of the block v<sub>B</sub>.  If we assume the wedge does not dissipate or store energy, then the power into the wedge equals the power out, so\n:<math> P = F_A v_A = F_B v_B, \\!</math>\nor\n:<math>\\frac{F_B}{F_A} = \\frac{v_A}{v_B}. </math>\nThe velocity of the block is related to the velocity of the wedge by the slope of the side of the wedge.  If the angle of the wedge is \u03b1 then\n:<math> v_B = v_A \\tan\\alpha, \\!</math>\nwhich means\n:<math> MA = \\frac{F_B}{F_A} = \\frac{1}{\\tan\\alpha}. </math>\nThus, the smaller the angle \u03b1 the greater the ratio of the lifting force to the applied force on the wedge.  This is the [[mechanical advantage]] of the wedge.  This formula for mechanical advantage applies to cutting edges and splitting operations as well as to lifting.\n\nThey can also be used to separate objects, such as blocks of cut stone. [[Splitting maul]]s and splitting wedges are used to split wood along the grain. A narrow wedge with a relatively long [[Cone|taper]] used to finely adjust the distance between objects is called a [[shim (engineering)|shim]], and is commonly used in carpentry.\n\nThe tips of forks and [[nail (engineering)|nails]] are also wedges, as they split and separate the material into which they are pushed or driven; the shafts may then hold fast due to friction.\n\n==Blades and wedges==\nThe [[blade]] is a compound inclined plane, consisting of two inclined planes placed so that the planes meet at one edge. When the edge where the two planes meet is pushed into a solid or fluid substance it overcomes the resistance of materials to separate by transferring the force exerted against the material into two opposing forces normal to the faces of the blade.\n\nThe blade's first known use by humans was the sharp edge of a [[Flint|flint stone]] that was used to cleave or split animal tissue, e.g. cutting meat. The use of [[iron]] or other metals led to the development of [[Knife|knives]] for those kind of tasks. The blade of the knife allowed humans to cut meat, fibers, and other plant and animal materials with much less force than it would take to tear them apart by simply pulling with their hands. Other examples are [[plows]], which separate soil particles, [[scissors]] which separate fabric, [[axe]]s which separate wood fibers, and [[chisels]] and [[plane (tool)|planes]]  which separate wood.\n\nWedges, [[saw]]s and [[chisels]] can separate thick and hard materials, such as wood, solid stone and hard metals and they do so with much less force, waste of material, and with more precision, than [[crusher|crushing]], which is the application of the same force over a wider area of the material to be separated.\n\nOther examples of wedges are found in [[drill bit]]s, which  produce circular holes in solids. The two edges of a drill bit are sharpened, at opposing angles,  into a point and that edge is wound around the shaft of the drill bit. When the drill bit spins on its axis of rotation, the wedges are forced into the material to be separated. The resulting cut in the material is in the direction of rotation of the drill bit while the helical shape of a bit allows the removal of the cut material.\n\n==Examples for holding fast==\nWedges can also be used to hold objects in place, such as [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] parts ([[poppet valve]]s), [[bicycle]] parts ([[Stem (bicycle part)|stem]]s and [[Eccentric (mechanism)|eccentric]] [[bottom bracket]]s), and [[door]]s. A wedge-type [[door wedge|door stop]] (door wedge) functions largely because of the friction generated between the bottom of the door and the wedge, and the wedge and the floor (or other surface).\n\n== Mechanical advantage ==\n[[Image:Wedge-diagram.svg|thumb|100px|Cross-section of a splitting wedge with its length oriented vertically. A downward force produces forces perpendicular to its inclined surfaces.]]\n\nThe mechanical advantage of a wedge can be calculated by dividing the length of the slope by the wedge's width:<ref name=\"bowser\"/>\n\n:<math>\\rm MechanicalAdvantage={Length \\over Width}</math>\n\nThe more [[acute angle|acute]], or narrow, the angle of a wedge, the greater the ratio of the length of its slope to its width, and thus the more mechanical advantage it will yield.<ref name=\"CEST\"/>\n\nHowever, in an elastic material such as wood, friction may bind a narrow wedge more easily than a wide one. This is why the head of a splitting maul has a much wider angle than that of an axe.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Axe]]\n* [[Blade]]\n* [[Knife]]\n* [[Log splitter]]\n* [[Plug and feather]]\n* [[Pushpin]]\n* [[Splitting maul]]\n* [[Scalpel]]\n* [[Scissors]]\n* [[Screw]]\n* [[Chock (wheel)|Wheel chock]]\n* [[Wheel and Axle]]\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Wedges}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Simple machines}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:Tools]]\n[[Category:Simple machines]]"}]}}}}
