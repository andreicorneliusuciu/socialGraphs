An interior or exterior corner, with an angle or type of bevel, is called a \"[[chamfer]]\". Fillet geometry, when on an interior corner is a line of [[concave function]], whereas a fillet on an exterior corner is a line of [[convex function]] (in these cases, fillets are typically referred to as rounds).\n\n==Applications==\n* [[Stress concentration]] is a problem of load-bearing mechanical parts which is reduced by employing fillets on points and lines of expected high stress. The fillets distribute the stress over a broader area and effectively make the parts more durable and capable of bearing larger loads.\n* For considerations in [[aerodynamics]], fillets are employed to reduce [[interference drag]] where aircraft components such as wings, struts, and other surfaces meet one another.\n* For manufacturing, concave corners are sometimes filleted to allow the use of round-tipped [[end mill]]s to cut out an area of a material. This has a ''cycle time'' benefit if the round mill is simultaneously being used to mill complex curved surfaces.\n* Radii are used to eliminate sharp edges that can be easily damaged or that can cause injury when the part is handled.<ref>Visualization, modeling, and graphics for engineering design\n By Dennis Kenmon Lieu, Sheryl Sorby, Page 6-31</ref>\n\n==Design process==\nFillets can be quickly designed onto parts using [[Solid modeling|3D solid modeling]] engineering [[CAD software]] by invoking the function and picking edges of interest. Once these features are included in the CAD design of a part, they are often manufactured automatically using [[cnc|computer-numerical control]].\n\nDifferent packages use different names for the same operations. [[CATIA]], [[Vectorworks]], [[Autodesk Inventor]] and [[Solidworks]] refer to both concave and convex rounded edges as fillets, while referring to angled cuts of edges and concave corners as chamfers. [[Unigraphics]] and [[CADKEY]] refer to concave and convex rounded edges as ''blends''. [[Creo]] (formerly Pro/Engineer) refers to rounded edges simply as ''rounds''. [[FreeCAD]] has a ''Fillet'' operation for rounded edges, and a ''Chamfer'' operation for angled edges. Other 3D solid modeling software programs outside of engineering, such as [[gameSpace]], have similar functions.\n\nSmooth edges connecting two simple flat features are generally simple for a computer to create and fast for a human user to specify.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Welding#Geometry|Welding]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.unified-eng.com/scitech/weld/fillet.html Welding fillets] Link missing\n\n[[Category:Mechanical engineering]]"}]}}}}
