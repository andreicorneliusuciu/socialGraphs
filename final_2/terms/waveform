In these cases, the term \"waveform\" refers to the shape of a graph of the varying quantity against time. An instrument called an [[oscilloscope]] can be used to pictorially represent a wave as a repeating image on a [[Display device|screen]].\n\nTo be more specific, a waveform is depicted by a graph that shows the changes in a recorded signal's amplitude over the duration of recording.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Waveform Definition|url = http://techterms.com/definition/waveform|website = techterms.com|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}</ref> The amplitude of the signal is measured on the <math>y</math>-axis (vertical), and time on the <math>x</math>-axis (horizontal).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Examples of waveforms ==\nMost programs show waveforms to give the user a visual aid of what has been recorded. If the waveform is of low or high height (with respect to the <math>x</math> axis), the recording was most likely conducted under conditions with a low or high input volume, respectively. From this example, it follows that the curve represented by the waveform is affected by both the input signal and conditions under which it is recorded.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA [[periodic waveforms]] include these while <math>t</math> is [[time]], <math>\\lambda</math> is [[wavelength]], <math>a</math> is [[amplitude]] and <math>\\phi</math> is phase:\n\n*[[Sine wave]]<math>(t, \\lambda, a, \\phi) = a\\sin \\frac{2\\pi t - \\phi}{\\lambda}</math>. The amplitude of the waveform follows a [[trigonometric]] sine function with respect to time.\n*[[Square wave]]<math>(t, \\lambda, a, \\phi) = \\begin{cases}\na, & (t-\\phi) \\bmod \\lambda < \\text{duty} \\\\\n-a, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}</math>. This waveform is commonly used to represent digital information. A square wave of constant [[frequency|period]] contains odd [[harmonic]]s that decrease at \u22126&nbsp;dB/octave.\n*[[Triangle wave]]<math>(t, \\lambda, a, \\phi) = \\frac{2a}{\\pi} \\arcsin \\sin \\frac{2\\pi t - \\phi}{\\lambda}</math>. It contains odd [[harmonic]]s that decrease at \u221212&nbsp;dB/octave.\n*[[Sawtooth wave]]<math>(t,\\lambda, a, \\phi) = \\frac{2a}{\\pi} \\arctan \\tan \\frac{2\\pi t - \\phi}{2\\lambda}</math>. This looks like the teeth of a saw. Found often in time bases for display scanning. It is used as the starting point for [[subtractive synthesis]], as a sawtooth wave of constant [[frequency|period]] contains odd and even [[harmonic]]s that decrease at \u22126 [[decibel|dB]]/octave.\n\nOther waveforms are often called composite waveforms and can often be described as a combination of a number of sinusoidal waves or other [[basis functions]] added together.\n\nThe [[Fourier series]] describes the decomposition of periodic waveforms, such that any periodic waveform can be formed by the sum of a (possibly infinite) set of fundamental and harmonic components. Finite-energy non-periodic waveforms can be analyzed into sinusoids by the [[Fourier transform]].{{Relevance-inline|paragraph|date=September 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[AC waveform]]\n* [[Arbitrary waveform generator]]\n* [[Spectrum analyzer]]\n* [[Waveform monitor]]\n* [[Waveform viewer]]\n* [[Wave packet]]\n\n==References==\n*Yuchuan Wei, Qishan Zhang.
