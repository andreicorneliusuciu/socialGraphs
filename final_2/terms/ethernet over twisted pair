This led to the development of '''10BASE-T''' and its successors [[100BASE-TX]] and [[1000BASE-T]], supporting speeds of 10, 100 and 1,000&nbsp;[[Mbit/s]] respectively.{{efn|Generally, the higher-speed implementations support the lower-speed standards making it possible to mix different generations of equipment; with the inclusive capability designated 10/100 or 10/100/1000 for connections that support such combinations.<ref>{{cite book |title= Ethernet: the definitive guide |author= Charles E.

The leading number (''10'' in 10BASE-T) refers to the transmission speed in Mbit/s. ''BASE'' denotes that [[baseband]] transmission is used. The '''T''' designates twisted pair cable, where the pair of wires for each signal is twisted together to reduce [[radio frequency interference]] and [[crosstalk]] between pairs. Where there are several standards for the same transmission speed, they are distinguished by a letter or digit following the T, such as ''TX'', referring to the encoding method and number of lanes.<ref>IEEE 802.3 ''1.2.3 Physical Layer and media notation''</ref>\n\n==Cabling==\n[[File:Rj45plug-8p8c.png|thumb|240px|[[8P8C]] modular plug pin positioning]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;clear:right;margin-left:1em\"\n|+ [[TIA/EIA-568]] T568A termination <!--standard name is 'B' termination options are 'A' or 'B'-->\n!

Since these standards differ only in that they swap the positions of the two pairs used for transmitting and receiving (TX/RX), a cable with [[TIA/EIA-568-B#T568A and T568B termination|T568A]] wiring at one end and [[TIA/EIA-568-B#T568A and T568B termination|T568B]] wiring at the other is referred to as a crossover cable.  The terms used in the explanations of the 568 standards, [[tip and ring]], refer to [[Phone connector (audio)|older communication technologies]], and equate to the [[Electric charge|positive and negative]] parts of the connections.\n\nA 10BASE-T or 100BASE-TX node such as a PC uses a connector wiring called [[medium dependent interface]]s (MDI), [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmitting]] on pin 1 and 2 and receiving on pin 3 and 6 to a [[Computer network|network device]]. An infrastructure node (a [[Ethernet hub|hub]] or a [[Ethernet switch|switch]]) accordingly uses a connector wiring called MDI-X, transmitting on pin 3 and 6 and receiving on pin 1 and 2. These ports are connected using a \"straight-through\" cable, so each transmitter talks to the receiver on the other side.\n\nNodes can have two types of ports: MDI (uplink port) or MDI-X (regular port, 'X' for internal crossover). Hubs and switches have regular ports. Routers, servers and end hosts (e.g. [[Personal Computer|personal computers]]) have uplink ports. When two nodes having the same type of ports need to be connected, a crossover cable is often required at speeds of 10 or 100&nbsp;Mbit/s, else connecting nodes having different type of ports (i.e. MDI to MDI-X and vice versa) requires straight-through cable. Thus connecting an end host to a hub or switch requires a straight-through cable. On switches/hubs sometimes a button is provided to allow a port to act as either a normal (regular) or an uplink port, i.e. using MDI-X or MDI pinout respectively.\n\nMany modern Ethernet host adapters can automatically detect another computer connected with a straight-through cable and then automatically introduce the required crossover, if needed; if neither of the adapters has this capability, then a crossover cable is required. Most newer switches have automatic crossover (\"auto MDI-X\" or \"auto-uplink\") on all ports, eliminating the uplink port and the MDI/MDI-X switch, and allowing all connections to be made with straight-through cables.  If both devices being connected support 1000BASE-T according to the standards, they will connect regardless of whether a straight-through or crossover cable is used.\n\nA 10BASE-T transmitter sends two differential voltages, +2.5&nbsp;V or \u22122.5&nbsp;V.\n\n100BASE-TX follows the same wiring patterns as 10BASE-T, but is more sensitive to wire quality and length, due to the higher [[bit-rate|bit rates]].\n\nA 100BASE-TX transmitter sends three differential voltages, +1&nbsp;V, 0&nbsp;V, or \u22121&nbsp;V.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|title = Electromagnetic Compatibility: principles and applications\n|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=392CdZHdUDEC&pg=PA240\n|author =  David A.

Category 5 cable has since been deprecated and new installations use Category 5e.\n\nUnlike earlier Ethernet standards using [[broadband]] and [[coaxial cable]], such as [[10BASE5]] ([[thicknet]]) and [[10BASE2]] ([[thinnet]]), 10BASE-T does not specify the exact type of wiring to be used, but instead specifies certain characteristics that a cable must meet.  This was done in anticipation of using 10BASE-T in existing twisted-pair wiring systems that may not conform to any specified wiring standard.  Some of the specified characteristics are [[attenuation]], [[characteristic impedance]], timing [[jitter]], [[propagation delay]], and several types of [[signal noise|noise]].  Cable testers are widely available to check these parameters to determine if a cable can be used with 10BASE-T.  These characteristics are expected to be met by 100 meters of 24-[[American wire gauge|gauge]] unshielded twisted-pair cable.  However, with high quality cabling, cable runs of 150 meters or longer are often obtained and are considered viable by most technicians familiar with the 10BASE-T specification.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n=== Shared cable ===\n\n{{main | Category 5 cable#Shared cable }}\n\n10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX only require two pairs (pins 1\u20132, 3\u20136) to operate.  Since [[Category 5 cable]] has four pairs, it is possible, but not necessarily standards compliant, to use the spare pairs (pins 4\u20135, 7\u20138) in 10- and 100-Mbit/s configurations. The spare pairs may be used for [[Power over Ethernet]] (PoE), or two [[RJ11|phone lines]], or a second 10BASE-T or 100BASE-TX connection. In practice, great care must be taken to separate these pairs as most 10/100-Mbit/s hubs, switches, and PCs [[Electrical termination|electrically terminate]] the unused pins.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}<!--termination requirement can probably be found in 802.3--> Moreover, 1000BASE-T requires all four pairs to operate.\n\n==Autonegotiation and duplex mismatch==\n{{Main|Autonegotiation|Duplex mismatch}}\n\nMany different modes of operations (10BASE-T half duplex, 10BASE-T full duplex, 100BASE-TX half duplex, ...) exist for Ethernet over [[twisted pair]], and most [[network adapter]]s are capable of different modes of operation. 1000BASE-T requires autonegotiation to be on in order to operate.\n\nWhen two linked interfaces are set to different [[Duplex (telecommunications)|duplex]] modes, the effect of this [[duplex mismatch]] is a network that functions much more slowly than its nominal speed. Duplex mismatch may be inadvertently caused when an administrator configures an interface to a fixed mode (e.g. 100&nbsp;Mbit/s full duplex) and fails to configure the remote interface, leaving it set to autonegotiate. Then, when the autonegotiation process fails, half duplex is assumed by the autonegotiating side of the link.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Twisted pair based ethernet.svg|600px|Comparison of twisted pair based ethernet technologies]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\" | Speed &#91;Mbit/s&#93;\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"80px\" | Distance &#91;m&#93;\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"70px\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"110px\" | Standard<br/>/ Year\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"350px\" | Description\n|-\n|align=right| 1\n|align=right| 100 <br/>(nominally)\n| [[StarLAN]]\n| 802.3e 1986<ref>{{cite book |title= 802.3a,b,c, and e-1988 IEEE Standards for Local Area Networks: Supplements to Carrier Sense Multiple Access With Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications |year= 1987 |publisher= [[IEEE Standards Association]] |doi= 10.1109/IEEESTD.1987.78883 |url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=2565 }}</ref>\n| Runs over four wires (two [[twisted pair]]s) on telephone twisted pair or [[Category 3 cable|Category 3]] cable.
