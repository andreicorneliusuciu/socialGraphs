The name is an [[acronym]] which stands for \"'''Compact Disc [[Read-Only Memory]]'''\". Computers can read CD-ROMs, but cannot write to CD-ROMs which are not writable or erasable.\n\nFrom the mid-1990s until the mid-2000s, CD-ROMs were popularly used to distribute [[software]] for computers and [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|video game consoles]]. Some CDs, called [[enhanced CD]]s, hold both computer data and audio with the latter capable of being played on a [[Compact Disc Player|CD player]], while data (such as software or digital video) is only usable on a computer (such as [[ISO 9660]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = CD Yellow Book Standards|url = http://www.mediatechnics.com/yellowbook.htm|website = www.mediatechnics.com|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}</ref> format PC CD-ROMs).\n\nAn early CD-ROM format was developed by [[Sony]] and [[Denon]], introduced at a [[Japan]]ese computer show in 1984. It was an extension of [[Compact Disc Digital Audio]], and adapted the format to hold any form of digital data, with a capacity of 540 [[MiB]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbh1XP4kCT4 Japanese PCs (1984)] (14:24), ''[[Computer Chronicles]]''</ref> The ''Yellow Book'' is the [[technical standard]] that defines the format of CD-ROMs. One of a set of [[Rainbow Books|color-bound books]] that contain the [[technical specification]]s for all CD formats, the ''Yellow Book'', standardized by Sony and [[Philips]] in 1988, has a capacity of 650 MiB.\n\n==CD-ROM discs==\n=== Media ===\n[[File:CD-ROM Drive \uff08Dell\uff09.jpg|thumb|A CD-ROM in the tray of a partially open CD-ROM drive.]]CD-ROMs are identical in appearance to [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|audio CD]]s, and data are stored and retrieved in a very similar manner (only differing from audio CDs in the standards used to store the data). Discs are made from a 1.2&nbsp;mm thick disc of [[polycarbonate]] [[plastic]], with a thin layer of [[aluminium]] to make a reflective surface. The most common size of CD-ROM is 120&nbsp;mm in diameter, though the smaller [[Mini CD]] standard with an 80&nbsp;mm diameter, as well as [[Shaped Compact Disc|shaped compact discs]] in numerous non-standard sizes and molds (e.g., [[Bootable business card|business card-sized media]]) are also available.{{Citation needed|reason=Mini CDs being CD-ROMs|date=March 2013}}\n\nData are stored on the disc as a series of microscopic indentations. A [[laser]] is shone onto the reflective surface of the disc to read the pattern of pits and lands (\"pits\", with the gaps between them referred to as \"lands\"). Because the depth of the pits is approximately one-quarter to one-sixth of the wavelength of the laser light used to read the disc, the reflected [[Light beam|beam]]'s [[phase (waves)|phase]] is shifted in relation to the incoming beam, causing [[destructive interference]] and reducing the reflected beam's intensity. This pattern of changing intensity of the reflected beam is converted into binary data.\n\n=== Standard ===\nSeveral formats are used for data stored on compact discs, known as the [[Rainbow Books]]. The ''Yellow Book'', published in 1988,<ref name=\"techtarget\"/> defines the specifications for CD-ROMs, standardized in 1989 as the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 10149 / [[Ecma International|ECMA]]-130 standard. The CD-ROM standard builds on top of the original [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|Red Book]] [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] standard for CD audio. Other standards, such as the [[White Book (CD standard)|''White Book'']] for [[Video CD]]s, further define formats based on the CD-ROM specifications. The ''Yellow Book'' itself is not freely available, but the standards with the corresponding content can be downloaded for free from ISO<ref name=\"iso-cdrom\" /> or ECMA.<ref name=\"ecma130\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-130.htm |title=Data Interchange on Read-only 120 mm Optical Data Disks (CD-ROM) |publisher=ECMA |date=June 1996 |accessdate=2009-04-26}}</ref>\n\nThere are several standards that define how to structure data files on a CD-ROM. [[ISO 9660]] defines the standard [[file system]] for a CD-ROM. [[ISO 13490]] is an improvement on this standard which adds support for non-sequential [[Write Once Read Many|write-once]] and re-writeable discs such as [[CD-R]] and [[CD-RW]], as well as [[Session (CD)|multiple sessions]]. The ISO 13346 standard was designed to address most of the shortcomings of ISO 9660,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standards.com/StandardsDownloads/birth.html |title=Birth Announcement: ISO/IEC 13346 and ISO/IEC 13490 |publisher=Standards.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-23}}</ref> and a subset of it evolved into the [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] format, which was  adopted for [[DVD]]s. The bootable CD specification, to make a CD emulate a [[hard disk]] or [[floppy disk]], is called [[El Torito (CD-ROM standard)|El Torito]].\n\n=== {{anchor|Mode 1|Mode 2}}CD-ROM format ===\nData stored on CD-ROMs follows the standard [[Compact Disc Digital Audio#Data encoding|CD data encoding]] techniques described in the ''Red Book'' specification (originally defined for [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|audio CD]] only). This includes [[cross-interleaved Reed\u2013Solomon coding]] (CIRC), [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] (EFM), and the use of [[Compact disc#Physical details|pits and lands]] for coding the bits into the physical surface of the CD.\n\nThe structures used to group data on a CD-ROM are also derived from the ''Red Book''. Like audio CDs (CD-DA), a CD-ROM ''sector'' contains 2,352 [[byte]]s of user data, composed of 98 frames, each consisting of 33-bytes (24 bytes for the user data, 8 bytes for error correction, and 1 byte for the subcode). Unlike audio CDs, the data stored in these sectors corresponds to any type of digital data, not audio samples encoded according to the audio CD specification. To structure, address and protect this data, the CD-ROM standard further defines two sector modes, Mode 1 and Mode 2, which describe two different layouts for the data inside a sector.<ref name=\":0\" /> A [[track (CD)|track]] (a group of sectors) inside a CD-ROM only contains sectors in the same mode, but if multiple tracks are present in a CD-ROM, each track can have its sectors in a different mode from the rest of the tracks. They can also coexist with audio CD tracks as well, which is the case of [[Mixed Mode CD|mixed mode CD]]s.\n\nBoth Mode 1 and 2 sectors use the first 16 bytes for [[header (computing)|header]] information, but differ in the remaining 2,336 bytes due to the use of [[error correction]] bytes. Unlike an audio CD, a CD-ROM cannot rely on error concealment by [[interpolation]]; a higher reliability of the retrieved data is required. To achieve improved error correction and detection, Mode 1, used mostly for digital data, adds a 32-bit [[cyclic redundancy check]] (CRC) code for error detection, and a third layer of [[Reed\u2013Solomon error correction]]{{refn|group=n|Note that the [[Cross-Interleaved Reed-Solomon Coding|CIRC]] error correction system used in the CD audio format has two interleaved layers.}} using a Reed-Solomon Product-like Code (RSPC). Mode 1 therefore contains 288 bytes per sector for error detection and correction, leaving 2,048 bytes per sector available for data. Mode 2, which is more appropriate for image or video data (where perfect reliability may be a little bit less important), contains no additional error detection or correction bytes, having therefore 2,336 available data bytes per sector. Note that both modes, like audio CDs, still benefit from the [[Compact Disc Digital Audio#Data encoding|lower layers of error correction]] at the frame level.<ref name=\"cdrfaq\" />\n\nBefore being stored on a disc with the techniques described above, each CD-ROM sector is scrambled to prevent some problematic patterns from showing up.<ref name=\"ecma130\"/> These scrambled sectors then follow the same encoding process described in the ''Red Book'' in order to be finally stored on a CD.\n\nThe following table shows a comparison of the structure of sectors in CD-DA and CD-ROMs:<ref name=\"ecma130\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This value, 150 KiB/s, is defined as \"1\u00d7 speed\". Therefore, for Mode 1 CD-ROMs, a 1\u00d7 CD-ROM drive reads 150/2 = 75 consecutive sectors per second.\n\nThe playing time of a standard CD is 74 minutes, or 4,440 seconds, contained in 333,000 blocks or [[disk sector|sector]]s. Therefore, the net capacity of a Mode-1 CD-ROM is 682&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] or, equivalently, 650&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]. For 80 minute CDs, the capacity is 737 MB (703 MiB).\n\n==={{anchor|XA|Mode 2 Form 1|Mode 2 Form 2}}CD-ROM XA extension===\n''CD-ROM XA'' is an extension of the ''Yellow Book'' standard for CD-ROMs that combines compressed audio, video and computer data, allowing all to be accessed simultaneously.<ref>[http://sony.storagesupport.com/node/6405 What are CD-ROM Mode-1, Mode-2 and XA?], Sony Storage Support</ref> It was intended as a bridge between CD-ROM and [[CD-i]] ([[Green Book (CD-interactive standard)|Green Book]]) and was published by [[Sony]] and [[Philips]] in 1991.<ref name=\"techtarget\">{{cite web|url=http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/Yellow-Book |title=What is Yellow Book? |publisher=Searchstorage.techtarget.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-23}}</ref> \"XA\" stands for eXtended Architecture.\n\nCD-ROM XA defines two new sector layouts, called Mode 2 Form 1 and Mode 2 Form 2 (which are different from the original Mode 2).

XA Mode 2 Form 2 has 2,324 bytes of user data, and is similar to the standard Mode 2 but with error detection bytes added (though no error correction).

The file size of a disc image created in raw mode is ''always'' a multiple of 2,352 bytes (the size of a block).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.memorex.com/downloads/whitepapers/WhitePaper_Reference_Guide_Optical_Media_Mar2406.pdf |title=Optical Media FAQs |accessdate=2007-01-06 |format=PDF |work= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022035649/http://memorex.com/downloads/whitepapers/WhitePaper_Reference_Guide_Optical_Media_Mar2406.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> Disc image formats that store raw CD-ROM sectors include [[CloneCD Control File|CCD/IMG]], [[Cue sheet (computing)|CUE/BIN]], and [[MDF and MDS file pair|MDS/MDF]]. The size of a disc image created from the data in the sectors will depend on the type of sectors it is using. For example, if a CD-ROM mode 1 image is created by extracting only each sector's data, its size will be a multiple of 2,048; this is usually the case for [[ISO image|ISO disc images]].\n\nOn a 74-minute CD-R, it is possible to fit larger disc images using raw mode, up to 333,000 \u00d7 2,352 = 783,216,000 bytes (~747&nbsp;MiB). This is the upper limit for raw images created on a 74 min or ~650&nbsp;MiB ''Red Book'' CD. The 14.8% increase is due to the discarding of error correction data.\n\n=== Manufacture ===\n{{Main|Compact Disc manufacturing}}\n\nPre-pressed CD-ROMs are mass-produced by a process of stamping where a glass master disc is created and used to make \"stampers\", which are in turn used to manufacture multiple copies of the final disc with the pits already present. Recordable ([[CD-R]]) and rewritable ([[CD-RW]]) discs are manufactured by a different method, whereby the data are recorded on them by a laser changing the properties of a dye or [[phase transition]] material in a process that is often referred to as \"[[Optical disc authoring|burning]]\".\n\n=== Capacity ===\n[[File:Print vs. bytes.jpg|thumb|A CD-ROM can easily store the entirety of a paper encyclopedia's words and images, plus audio & video clips]]\n\nCD-ROM capacities are normally expressed with [[binary prefixes]], subtracting the space used for error correction data. A standard 120&nbsp;mm, ''700 MB'' CD-ROM can actually hold about 737&nbsp;MB (703&nbsp;MiB) of data with error correction (or 847&nbsp;MB total). In comparison, a single-layer [[DVD-ROM]] can hold 4.7&nbsp;GB of error-protected data, more than 6 CD-ROMs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ Capacities of Compact Disc types (90 and 99 minute discs are not standard)\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Type\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Sectors\n!colspan=\"2\"| Data max. size<!-- 2,048 byte/sector -->\n!| Audio max. size <!-- 2,352 byte/sector -->\n!<!--colspan=\"2\"|--> Time <!-- 75 sector/s -->\n|-\n!

A CD-ROM drive may be connected to the computer via an IDE ([[Advanced Technology Attachment|ATA]]), [[SCSI]], [[Serial ATA|SATA]], [[IEEE 1394 interface|FireWire]], or [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] interface or a proprietary interface, such as the [[Panasonic CD interface]], LMSI/Philips, Sony and Mitsumi standards, . Virtually all modern CD-ROM drives can also play [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|audio CDs]] (as well as [[Video CD]]s and other data standards) when used with the right software.\n\n=== Laser and optics ===\nCD-ROM drives employ a near-[[infrared]] 780&nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]] [[laser diode]]. The laser beam is directed onto the disc via an opto-electronic tracking module, which then detects whether the beam has been reflected or scattered.\n\n=== Transfer rates ===\nCD-ROM drives are rated with a speed factor relative to music CDs. If a CD-ROM is read at the same rotational speed as an [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|audio CD]], the data transfer rate is 150&nbsp;KiB/s, commonly called \"1\u00d7\". At this data rate, the track moves along under the laser spot at about 1.2&nbsp;m/s. To maintain this linear velocity as the optical head moves to different positions, the angular velocity is varied from 500 rpm at the inner edge to 200 rpm at the outer edge. The 1\u00d7 speed rating for CD-ROM (150&nbsp;KiB/s) is different from the 1\u00d7 speed rating for [[DVD]]s (1.32&nbsp;MiB/s).\n\nBy increasing the speed at which the disc is spun, data can be transferred at greater rates. For example, a CD-ROM drive that can read at 8\u00d7 speed spins the disc at 1600 to 4000&nbsp;rpm, giving a linear velocity of 9.6&nbsp;m/s and a transfer rate of 1200&nbsp;KiB/s. Above 12\u00d7 speed most drives read at [[Constant angular velocity]] (CAV, constant rpm) so that the motor is not made to change from one speed to another as the head seeks from place to place on the disc. In CAV mode the \"\u00d7\" number denotes the transfer rate at the outer edge of the disc, where it is a maximum.\n20\u00d7 was thought to be the maximum speed due to mechanical constraints until [[Samsung]] Electronics introduced the SCR-3230, a 32x CD-ROM drive which uses a ball [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] system to balance the spinning disc in the drive to reduce vibration and noise. As of 2004, the fastest transfer rate commonly available is about 52\u00d7 or 10,400 rpm and 7.62&nbsp;MiB/s. Higher spin speeds are limited by the strength of the polycarbonate plastic of which the discs are made. At 52\u00d7, the linear velocity of the outermost part of the disk is around 65&nbsp;m/s. However, improvements can still be obtained using multiple laser pickups as demonstrated by the [[Kenwood Electronics|Kenwood]] TrueX 72\u00d7 which uses seven laser beams and a rotation speed of approximately 10\u00d7.\n\nFaster 12\u00d7 drives were common beginning in early 1997. Above 12\u00d7 speed, there are problems with vibration and heat. CAV drives give speeds up to 30\u00d7 at the outer edge of the disc with the same rotational speed as a standard constant linear velocity (CLV) 12\u00d7, or 32\u00d7 with a slight increase. However, due to the nature of CAV (linear speed at the inner edge is still only 12\u00d7, increasing smoothly in-between) the actual throughput increase is less than 30/12: in fact, roughly 20\u00d7 average for a completely full disc, and even less for a partially filled one.\n\nProblems with vibration, owing to limits on achievable symmetry and strength in mass-produced media, mean that CD-ROM drive speeds have not massively increased since the late 1990s. Over 10 years later, commonly available drives vary between 24\u00d7 (slimline and portable units, 10\u00d7 spin speed) and 52\u00d7 (typically CD- and read-only units, 21\u00d7 spin speed), all using CAV to achieve their claimed \"max\" speeds, with 32\u00d7 through 48\u00d7 most common. Even so, these speeds can cause poor reading (drive error correction having become very sophisticated in response) and even shattering of poorly made or physically damaged media, with small cracks rapidly growing into catastrophic breakages when centripetally stressed at 10,000\u201313,000&nbsp;rpm (i.e. 40\u201352\u00d7 CAV). High rotational speeds also produce undesirable noise from disc vibration, rushing air and the spindle motor itself. Most 21st-century drives allow forced low speed modes (by use of small utility programs) for the sake of safety, accurate reading or silence, and will automatically fall back if numerous sequential read errors and retries are encountered.\n\nOther methods of improving read speed were trialled such as using multiple optical beams, increasing throughput up to 72\u00d7 with a 10\u00d7 spin speed, but along with other technologies like 90~99 minute recordable media and \"double density\" recorders, their utility was nullified by the introduction of consumer [[DVD-ROM]] drives capable of consistent 36\u00d7 CD-ROM speeds (4\u00d7 DVD) or higher. Additionally, with a 700&nbsp;MB CD-ROM fully readable in under 2\u00bd minutes at 52\u00d7 CAV, increases in actual data transfer rate are decreasingly influential on overall effective drive speed when taken into consideration with other factors such as loading/unloading, media recognition, spin up/down and random seek times, making for much decreased returns on development investment. A similar stratification effect has since been seen in DVD development where maximum speed has stabilised at 16\u00d7 CAV (with exceptional cases between 18\u00d7 and 22\u00d7) and capacity at 4.3 and 8.5 [[Gibibyte|GiB]] (single and dual layer), with higher speed and capacity needs instead being catered to by Blu-ray drives.\n\nCD-Recordable drives are often sold with three different speed ratings, one speed for write-once operations, one for re-write operations, and one for read-only operations. The speeds are typically listed in that order; i.e. a 12\u00d7/10\u00d7/32\u00d7 CD drive can, CPU and media permitting, write to CD-R discs at 12\u00d7 speed (1.76&nbsp;MiB/s), write to CD-RW discs at 10\u00d7 speed (1.46&nbsp;MiB/s), and read from CDs at 32\u00d7 speed (4.69&nbsp;MiB/s).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Common data transfer speeds for CD-ROM drives\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | Transfer speed\n!| [[KiB/s]]\n!| [[Mbit/s]]\n!| [[MiB/s]] {{refn|group=n|To three [[significant figures]].}}\n!| [[RPM]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n! 1\u00d7\n| 150\n| 1.2288\n| 0.146\n| 200\u2013500\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n! 2\u00d7\n| 300\n| 2.4576\n| 0.293\n| 400-1,000\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n! 4\u00d7\n| 600\n| 4.9152\n| 0.586\n| 800\u20132,000\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n! 8\u00d7\n| 1,200\n| 9.8304\n| 1.17\n| 1,600\u20134,000\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n! 10\u00d7\n| 1,500\n| 12.288\n| 1.46\n| 2,000\u20135,000\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n! 12\u00d7\n| 1,800\n| 14.7456\n| 1.76\n| 2,400\u20136,000\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n! 20\u00d7\n| 1,200\u20133,000\n| up to 24.576\n| up to 2.93\n| 4,000 ([[Constant Angular Velocity|CAV]])\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n! 32\u00d7\n| 1,920\u20134,800\n| up to 39.3216\n| up to 4.69\n| 6,400 ([[Constant Angular Velocity|CAV]])\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n! 36\u00d7\n| 2,160\u20135,400\n| up to 44.2368\n| up to 5.27\n| 7,200 ([[Constant Angular Velocity|CAV]])\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n! 40\u00d7\n| 2,400\u20136,000\n| up to 49.152\n| up to 5.86\n| 8,000 ([[Constant Angular Velocity|CAV]])\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n! 48\u00d7\n| 2,880\u20137,200\n| up to 58.9824\n| up to 7.03\n| 9,600 ([[Constant Angular Velocity|CAV]])\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n! 52\u00d7\n| 3,120\u20137,800\n| up to 63.8976\n| up to 7.62\n| 10,400 ([[Constant Angular Velocity|CAV]])\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n! 56\u00d7\n| 3,360\u20138,400\n| up to 68.8128\n| up to 8.20\n| 11,200 ([[Constant Angular Velocity|CAV]])\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n! 72\u00d7\n| 6,750\u201310,800\n| up to 88.4736\n| up to 10.5\n| 2,000 (multi-beam)\n|}\n\n== Copyright issues ==\n{{Main|Compact Disc and DVD copy protection}}\nSoftware distributors, and in particular distributors of computer games, often make use of various copy protection schemes to prevent software running from any media besides the original CD-ROMs. This differs somewhat from [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|audio CD]] protection in that it is usually implemented in both the media and the software itself. The CD-ROM itself may contain \"weak\" sectors to make copying the disc more difficult, and additional data that may be difficult or impossible to copy to a CD-R or disc image, but which the software checks for each time it is run to ensure an original disc and not an unauthorized copy is present in the computer's CD-ROM drive.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nManufacturers of CD writers ([[CD-R]] or [[CD-RW]]) are encouraged by the music industry to ensure that every drive they produce has a unique identifier, which will be encoded by the drive on every disc that it records: the RID or Recorder Identification Code.<ref>{{cite web |last=Schoen |first=Seth |url=http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2007/07/harry-potter-and-digital-fingerprints |title=Harry Potter and the Digital Fingerprints |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |date= July 20, 2007 |accessdate= October 24, 2007}}</ref> This is a counterpart to the Source Identification Code (SID), an eight character code beginning with \"[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry|IFPI]]\" that is usually stamped on discs produced by CD recording plants.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[CD/DVD authoring]]\n* [[Compact Disc Digital Audio]]\n* [[Computer hardware]]\n* [[DVD-Audio]]\n* [[DVD-ROM]]\n* [[Evolution of storage devices]]\n* [[MultiLevel Recording]]\n* [[Optical disc drive]]\n* [[Phase-change Dual]]\n* [[Thor-CD]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Rainbow Books}}\n{{Ecma International Standards}}\n{{CD}}\n{{Video game music}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Compact disc]]\n[[Category:Computer storage media]]\n[[Category:Ecma standards]]\n[[Category:Optical computer storage]]\n[[Category:Optical computer storage media]]\n[[Category:Rainbow Books]]\n[[Category:Video game distribution]]\n\n[[ar:\u0633\u064a \u062f\u064a-\u0631\u0648\u0645]]\n[[et:Kollane raamat]]\n[[it:Yellow Book]]"}]}}}}
