A solid or liquid [[electrolyte]] which covers the surface of the oxide layer serves as the second, [[cathode]] electrode (\u2212) of the capacitor. Because of its very thin and relatively high [[permittivity]] dielectric layer, the tantalum capacitor distinguishes itself from other conventional and electrolytic capacitors in having high [[capacitance]] per volume (high volumetric efficiency) and lower weight.\n\nMost tantalum capacitors are available as [[surface-mount device]]s with a solid [[manganese dioxide]] or solid [[polymer]] electrolyte. A solid electrolyte ensures low [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR) and a stable electrical behavior over a broad temperature range. The high specific capacitance of tantalum capacitors makes them particularly suitable for passing or bypassing low-frequency signals up to some mega-hertz and storing large amounts of energy to support the power rails of highly [[integrated circuit]]s. Especially the SMD version with its small size and weight make tantalum capacitors attractive for flat or small products.  However, due to the cost of tantalum ore, tantalum electrolytic capacitors are considerably more expensive than comparable [[aluminum electrolytic capacitor]]s.\n\nTantalum capacitors are polarized components. Reverse voltage or ripple currents higher than specified can destroy the dielectric and thus the capacitor. For safe operation of tantalum capacitors, special circuit design rules are specified from the manufacturers.<ref name=\"AVX-Reliability\">Ch.

Applying a positive voltage to the tantalum anode material in an electrolytic bath forms an oxide barrier layer with a thickness proportional to the applied voltage. This oxide layer serves as the dielectric in an electrolytic capacitor. The properties of this oxide layer compared with tantalum oxide layer are given in the following table:\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Characteristics of the different oxide layers in tantalum and niobium electrolytic capacitors<ref name=Karnik>Tom\u00e1\u0161 K\u00e1rn\u00edk, AVX,  NIOBIUM OXIDE FOR CAPACITOR MANUFACTURING , METAL 2008, 13. \u201315. 5. 2008, Hradec nad Moravic\u00ed [http://konference.tanger.cz/data/metal2008/sbornik/Lists/Papers/087.pdf PDF]</ref>\n!

An electrolyte acts as the cathode of electrolytic capacitors. There are many different electrolytes in use. Generally, the electrolytes will be distinguished into two species, ''non-solid'' and ''solid'' electrolytes. Non-solid electrolytes are a liquid medium whose [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]] is [[ion]]ic. Solid electrolytes have electron conductivity and thus solid electrolytic capacitors are more sensitive against voltages spikes or current surges{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}.\nThe oxide layer may be destroyed if the polarity of the applied voltage is reversed.\n\n[[File:Parallel plate capacitor.svg|thumb|left|A dielectric material is placed between two conducting plates (electrodes), each of area ''A'' and with a separation of ''d''.]]\n\nEvery electrolytic capacitor in principle forms a ''plate capacitor'' whose capacitance is greater the larger the electrode area, A, and the [[permittivity]], \u03b5, are and the thinner the thickness, d, of the dielectric is.\n\n:<math>C = \\varepsilon \\cdot \\frac{A}{d}</math>\n\nThe dielectric thickness of electrolytic capacitors is very thin, in the range of [[meter|nanometers]] per volt. Despite this, the dielectric strengths of these oxide layers are quite high. Thus, tantalum capacitors can achieve a high volumetric capacitance compared to other capacitor types.\n\nAll etched or sintered anodes have a much larger total surface area compared to a smooth surface of the same overall dimensions. This surface area increase boosts the capacitance value by a factor of up to 200 (depending on the rated voltage) for solid tantalum electrolytic capacitors.<ref name=Horacek >I. Horacek, T.

Gregorova, AVX, \"High CV Tantalum Capacitors: Challenges and Limitations\" [http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/Tantalum-NiobiumCapacitors/highcvtant.pdf PDF]</ref>\n\nThe volume of an electrolytic capacitor is defined by the product of capacitance and voltage, the so-called ''CV-volume''. However, in comparing the permittivities of different oxide materials, it is seen that tantalum pentoxide has an approximately 3 times higher permittivity than aluminum oxide. Tantalum electrolytic capacitors of a given CV value can therefore be smaller than aluminum electrolytic capacitors.\n\n===Basic construction of solid tantalum electrolytic capacitors===\n\n<center>\n<gallery perrow=\"3\" caption=\" Construction of a solid tantalum chip capacitor with manganese dioxide electrolyte\" class=\"centered\" mode=packed heights=150px>\nFile:Tantalum sintered pellet.jpg| The capacitor cell of a tantalum electrolytic capacitor consist out of sintered tantalum powder\nFile:Tantalum-Sintered-MnO2-slug.jpg| Schematic representation of the structure of a sintered tantalum electrolytic capacitor with solid electrolyte and the cathode contacting layers \nFile:Tantalum-SMD-Chip-Molded.jpg| Construction of a typical SMD tantalum electrolytic chip capacitor with solid electrolyte\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\nA typical tantalum capacitor is a chip capacitor and consists of tantalum powder pressed and [[sintering|sintered]] into a pellet as the [[anode]] of the capacitor, with the oxide layer of [[tantalum pentoxide]] as a [[dielectric]], and a solid manganese dioxide electrolyte as the [[cathode]].\n\n==Materials, production and styles==\n\n===Anode===\n[[File:Tantalum Powder CV.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A picture of three tantalum powder sizes.|Figure 1: Tantalum powder ''CV''/g.]]\n\nTantalum capacitors are manufactured from a powder of relatively pure elemental [[tantalum]] metal.<ref>[http://www.hcstarck.com/tantalum_capacitor_powder H.C.

Since the mid-1980s, manufactured tantalum powders have exhibited around a ten-fold improvement in CV/g values (from approximately 20k to 200k).<ref name=Horacek /> The typical particle size is between 2 and 10 \u03bcm. Figure 1 shows powders of successively finer grain, resulting in greater surface area per unit volume. Note the very great difference in particle size between the powders.\n\n[[File:Tantalum Sintered Anode.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A picture of tantalum powder sintered together.|Figure 2: Sintered anode.]]\nThe powder is compressed around a tantalum wire (known as the riser wire) to form a \"pellet\".<ref name=VIS-DC /> The riser wire ultimately becomes the anode connection to the capacitor. This pellet/wire combination is subsequently vacuum [[sintering|sintered]] at high temperature (typically 1200 to 1800&nbsp;\u00b0C) which produces a mechanically strong pellet and drives off many impurities within the powder. During sintering, the powder takes on a sponge-like structure, with all the particles interconnected into a monolithic spatial lattice. This structure is of predictable mechanical strength and density, but is also highly porous, producing a large internal surface area (see Figure 2).\n\nLarger surface areas produce higher capacitance; thus high ''CV''/g powders, which have lower average particle sizes, are used for low voltage, high capacitance parts. By choosing the correct powder type and sintering temperature, a specific capacitance or voltage rating can be achieved. For example, a 220&nbsp;\u03bcF 6&nbsp;V capacitor will have a surface area close to 346&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>, or 80% of the size of a sheet of paper (US Letter, 8.5\u00d711&nbsp;inch paper has area ~413&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>), although the total volume of the pellet is only about 0.0016&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>.\n\n===Dielectric===\n[[File:Tantalum Dielectric Layer.JPG|thumb|alt=Picture of sintered tantalum with dielectric layer.|Figure 3: Dielectric layer.]]\nThe [[dielectric]] is then formed over all the tantalum particle surfaces by the electrochemical process of [[anodizing|anodization]]. To achieve this, the \u201cpellet\u201d is submerged into a very weak solution of acid and DC voltage is applied. The total dielectric thickness is determined by the final voltage applied during the forming process. Initially the power supply is kept in a constant current mode until the correct voltage (i.e. dielectric thickness) has been reached; it then holds this voltage and the current decays to close to zero to provide a uniform thickness throughout the device and production lot.\nThe chemical equations describing the dielectric formation process at the [[anode]] are as follows:<ref name=AVX-Basic/>\n:2 Ta \u2192 2 Ta<sup>5+</sup> + 10 e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n:2 Ta<sup>5+</sup> + 10 OH<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + 5 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nThe oxide forms on the surface of the tantalum, but it also grows into the material. For each unit thickness of oxide growth, one third grows out and two thirds grows in. Due to the limits of oxide growth, there is a limit on the maximum voltage rating of tantalum oxide for each of the presently available tantalum powders (see Figure 3).\n\nThe dielectric layer thickness generated by the forming voltage is directly proportional to the voltage proof of electrolytic capacitors.<ref name=\"Thiesb\u00fcrger\">K.

That means that for a 25&nbsp;V tantalum capacitor with a safety margin of 4 the dielectric voltage proof can withstand 100&nbsp;V to provide a more robust dielectric.<ref>[http://www.kemet.com/Lists/TechnicalArticles/Attachments/199/2014%20EDFA%20Tantalum%20Cap%20Failure%20Analysis%20Review%20by%20Javaid%20Qazi.pdf J.

This is achieved by pyrolysis of [[manganese nitrate]] into [[manganese dioxide]]. The \u201cpellet\u201d is dipped into an aqueous solution of nitrate and then baked in an oven at approximately 250&nbsp;\u00b0C to produce the dioxide coat. The chemical equation is:<ref name=AVX-Basic/>\n\n:Mn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> \u2192 MnO<sub>2</sub> + 2 NO<sub>2</sub>\n\nThis process is repeated several times through varying specific gravities of nitrate solution, to build up a thick coat over all internal and external surfaces of the \u201cpellet\u201d, as shown in Figure 4.\n\nIn traditional construction, the \u201cpellet\u201d is successively dipped into [[graphite]] and then [[silver]] to provide a good connection from the manganese dioxide cathode plate to the external cathode termination(see Figure 5).\n[[File:Tantalum Cathode Termination.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a cross sectioned tantalum capacitor cathode.|Figure 5: Solid tantalum cathode cross section.]]\n\n===Production flow===\nThe picture below shows the production flow of tantalum electrolytic chip capacitors with sintered anode and solid manganese dioxide electrolyte.\n\n[[File:Tantalum Capacitor Production Flow.png|thumb|center|350px|Representation of the production flow of tantalum electrolytic capacitors with sintered anode and solid manganese dioxide electrolyte]]\n\n===Styles of tantalum capacitors===\n\nTantalum electrolytic capacitors are made in three different styles:<ref name=AVX-Basic />\n\n* Tantalum chip capacitors:  SMD style for surface mounting, 80% of all tantalum capacitors are SMDs \n* Tantalum \"pearls\", resin-dipped, single-ended style for PCB mounting\n* Axial-leaded tantalum capacitors, with solid and non-solid electrolyte, mostly used for military, medical and space applications.<ref>Vishay, Tantalum Capacitors, Review of Select Products \u2013 2009 [http://www.vishay.com/docs/49903/49903.pdf PDF]</ref>\n\n<center>\n<gallery perrow=\"3\" caption=\"Different styles of tantalum capacitors\" class=\"centered\" mode=packed heights=150px>\nFile:Kondensator-Ta-Chips-Wiki-07-02-11.jpg|Tantalum chip capacitors\nFile:Elektrolytkondensator-Tantal-Wiki-P1040343-07-02-18.jpg|Tantalum \"pearls\" for PCB mounting\nFile:Tantal-Elko-Axial-P1040292c.jpg| Axial tantalum capacitors\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n===Chip capacitors (case size)===\nMore than 90% of all tantalum electrolytic capacitors are manufactured in [[Surface Mounted Device|SMD]] style as tantalum chip capacitors. It has contact surfaces on the end faces of the case and is manufactured in different sizes, typically following the [[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]]-535-BAAC standard. The different sizes can also be identified by case code letters. For some case sizes (A to E), which have been manufactured for many decades, the dimensions and case coding over all manufactures are still largely the same. However, new developments in tantalum electrolytic capacitors such as the multi-anode technique to reduce the [[Equivalent series resistance|ESR]] or the \"face down\" technique to reduce the inductance have led to a much wider range of chip sizes and their case codes. These departures from EIA standards mean devices from different manufacturers are no longer always uniform.\n\nAn overview of the dimensions of conventional tantalum rectangular chip capacitors and their coding is shown in the following table:<ref>Manufacturer\u2019s Cross Reference and Tantalum Chip Capacitor Part Numbering Systems; F3075D; Kemet; November 2004>[http://www.chip-flip.com/fileadmin/redaktion/TANTALUM_CHIPS_CROSS_REFERENCES.pdf PDF]</ref>\n\n[[File:Ta-Chip-Case-Dimensions.jpg|thumb|Dimensioning of a tantalum chip capacitor]]\n{| class=\"wikitable centered\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Standard dimensions for surface-mount (SMD) tantalum chip capacitors\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Due to their self-healing properties (the non-solid electrolyte can deliver oxygen to form new oxide layer in weak areas of the dielectric), the dielectric thickness can be formed with much lower safety margins and consequently with much thinner dielectric than for solid types, resulting in a higher CV value per volume unit. Additionally, wet tantalum capacitors are able to operate at voltages in excess of 100&nbsp;V up to 630&nbsp;V, have a relatively low ESR, and have the lowest leakage current of all electrolytic capacitors.\n\nThe original wet tantalum capacitors developed in the 1930s were axial capacitors, having a wound cell consisting of a tantalum anode and foil cathode separated by a paper stripe soaked with an electrolyte, mounted in a silver case and non-hermetic elastomer sealed.<ref name=Tailor>D. F. Tailor, Tantalum and Tantalum Compounds, Fansteel Inc., Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Vol. 19, 2nd ed. 1969 John Wiley & sons, Inc.</ref> Because of the inertness and stability of the tantalum dielectric oxide layer against strong acids, the wet tantalum capacitors could use sulfuric acid as an electrolyte, thus providing them with a relatively low ESR.\n\nBecause the silver case in the past had problems with silver migration and whiskers, which led to increasing leakage currents and short circuits, new styles of wet tantalum capacitors use a sintered tantalum pellet cell and a gelled sulfuric acid electrolyte mounted in a pure tantalum case.\n\nDue to their relatively high price, wet tantalum electrolytic capacitors have no consumer applications. They are used in rough industrial applications, such as in probes for oil exploration. Types with military approvals can provide the extended capacitance and voltage ratings, along with the high quality levels required for avionics, military and space applications.\n\n==History==\n{{main article|Electrolytic_capacitor#History}}\nThe group of \"valve metals\" capable of forming an insulating oxide film was discovered in 1875.

All properties can be defined and specified by a series equivalent circuit composed of an idealized capacitance and additional electrical components which model all losses and inductive parameters of a capacitor. In this series-equivalent circuit the electrical characteristics are defined by:\n\n* ''C'', the capacitance of the capacitor\n* ''R''<sub>leak</sub>, the resistance representing the [[Leakage (electronics)|leakage current]] of the capacitor\n* ''R''<sub>ESR</sub>, the [[equivalent series resistance]] which summarizes all ohmic losses of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as \"ESR\"\n* ''L''<sub>ESL</sub>, the [[equivalent series inductance]] which is the effective self-inductance of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as \"ESL\".\n\nUsing a series equivalent circuit rather than a parallel equivalent circuit is specified by [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]/EN 60384-1.\n\n===Capacitance standard values and tolerances===\n\nThe electrical characteristics of tantalum electrolytic capacitors depend on the structure of the anode and the electrolyte used. This influences the capacitance value of tantalum capacitors, which depend on operating frequency and temperature. The basic unit of electrolytic capacitors capacitance is [[Farad|microfarad]] (\u03bcF).\n\nThe capacitance value specified in the data sheets of the manufacturers is called rated capacitance C<sub>R</sub> or nominal capacitance C<sub>N</sub> and is the value for which the capacitor has been designed. Standardized measuring condition for electrolytic capacitors is an AC measuring method with a frequency of 100 to 120&nbsp;Hz. Electrolytic capacitors differ from other capacitor types, whose capacitances are typically measured at 1&nbsp;kHz or higher. For tantalum capacitors a DC bias voltage of 1.1 to 1.5&nbsp;V for types with a rated voltage of \u22642,5&nbsp;V or 2.1 to 2.5&nbsp;V for types with a rated voltage of >2.5&nbsp;V may be applied during the measurement to avoid reverse voltage.\n\nThe percentage of allowed deviation of the measured capacitance from the rated value is called capacitance tolerance. Electrolytic capacitors are available in different tolerance series classifications, whose values are specified in the [[Preferred number|E series]] specified in IEC 60063. For abbreviated marking in tight spaces, a letter code for each tolerance is specified in IEC 60062.\n* rated capacitance, series E3, tolerance \u00b120%, letter code \"M\u201c\n* rated capacitance, series E6, tolerance \u00b120%, letter code \"M\u201c\n* rated capacitance, series E12, tolerance \u00b110%, letter code \"K\u201c\n\nThe required capacitance tolerance is determined by the particular application. Electrolytic capacitors, which are often used for [[Electronic filter|filtering]] and [[Decoupling capacitor|bypassing]] capacitors don\u2019t have the need for narrow tolerances because they are mostly not used for accurate frequency applications like [[oscillator]]s.\n\n===Rated and category voltage===\n[[File:Rated-Category.png|thumb|right|Relation between rated and category voltage and rated and category temperature]]\n\nReferring to IEC/EN 60384-1 standard the allowed operating voltage for tantalum capacitors is called \"rated voltage U<sub>R</sub> \" or \"nominal voltage U<sub>N</sub>\". The rated voltage U<sub>R</sub> is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously at any temperature within the rated temperature range T<sub>R</sub> (IEC/EN 60384-1).\n\nThe voltage rating of electrolytic capacitors decreases with increasing temperature. For some applications it is important to use a higher temperature range. Lowering the voltage applied at a higher temperature maintains safety margins. For some capacitor types therefore the IEC standard specify a \"temperature derated voltage\" for a higher temperature, the \"category voltage U<sub>C</sub>\". The category voltage is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously to a capacitor at any temperature within the category temperature range T<sub>C</sub>. The relation between both voltages and temperatures is given in the picture right.\n\nLower voltage applied may have positive influences for tantalum electrolytic capacitors. Lowering the voltage applied increases the reliability and reduces the expected failure rate.<ref name=AVX-Reliability />\n\nApplying a higher voltage than specified may destroy tantalum electrolytic capacitors.\n\n===Surge voltage===\n\nThe surge voltage indicates the maximum peak voltage value that may be applied to electrolytic capacitors during their application for a limited number of cycles. The surge voltage is standardized in IEC/EN 60384-1. For tantalum electrolytic capacitors the surge voltage shall be 1.3 times of the rated voltage, rounded off to the nearest volt.\nThe surge voltage applied to tantalum capacitors may influence the capacitors failure rate.<ref name=AVXsurge>J.

Although the current may only be a few microamps, it represents a very high localized current density which can cause a tiny hot-spot. This can cause some conversion of amorphous tantalum pentoxide to the more conductive crystalline form. When a high current is available, this effect can avalanche and the capacitor may become a total short.\n\nNevertheless, tantalum electrolytic capacitors can withstand for short instants a reverse voltage for a limited number of cycles. The most common guidelines for tantalum reverse voltage are:\n* 10% of rated voltage to a maximum of 1&nbsp;V at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C,\n* 3% of rated voltage to a maximum of 0.5&nbsp;V at 85&nbsp;\u00b0C,\n* 1% of rated voltage to a maximum of 0.1&nbsp;V at 125&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nThese guidelines apply for short excursion and should never be used to determine the maximum reverse voltage under which a capacitor can be used permanently.<ref>I.

For [[timer]]s or similar applications, capacitors are seen as a storage component to store electrical energy. But for smoothing, bypassing, or [[decoupling capacitor|decoupling]] applications like in [[power supply|power supplies]], the capacitors work additionally as [[Alternating current|AC]] [[resistor]]s to filter undesired AC components from voltage rails. For this (biased) AC function the frequency dependent AC resistance ([[Electrical impedance|impedance]] ''\"Z\"'') is as important as the capacitance value.\n\n[[File:Kondensator-Impedanzverl\u00e4ufe-Wiki-1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Typical impedance curves for different capacitance values over frequency. As higher the capacitance as lower the resonance frequency.]]\n\nThe impedance is the [[Complex number|complex]] ratio of the voltage to the current with both magnitude and [[Phasor|phase]] at a particular frequency in an AC circuit. In this sense impedance is a measure of the ability of the capacitor to attenuate alternating currents and can be used like Ohms law\n: <math>Z = \\frac{\\hat u}{\\hat \\imath} = \\frac{U_\\mathrm{eff}}{I_\\mathrm{eff}}.</math>\n\nThe impedance is a frequency dependent AC resistance and possesses both magnitude and phase at a particular frequency. In data sheets of electrolytic capacitors, only the impedance magnitude ''|Z|'' is specified, and simply written as ''\"Z\"''. Regarding to the IEC/EN 60384-1 standard, the impedance values of tantalum electrolytic capacitors are measured and specified at 10&nbsp;kHz or 100&nbsp;kHz depending on the capacitance and voltage of the capacitor.\n\nBesides measuring, the impedance can also be calculated using the idealized components out of a capacitor's series-equivalent circuit, including an ideal capacitor ''C'', a resistor ''ESR'', and an inductance ''ESL''. In this case the impedance at the angular frequency ''\u03c9'' therefore is given by the geometric (complex) addition of ''ESR'', by a capacitive reactance ''X<sub>C</sub>''\n\n: <math> X_C= -\\frac{1}{\\omega C}</math>\n\nand by an inductive reactance ''X<sub>L</sub>'' ([[Inductance]])\n\n<math> X_L=\\omega L_{\\mathrm{ESL}}</math>.\n\nThen ''Z'' is given by\n\n: <math>Z=\\sqrt{{ESR}^2 + (X_\\mathrm{C} + (-X_\\mathrm{L}))^2}</math>.\n\nIn the special case of [[resonance]], in which the both reactive resistances ''X<sub>C</sub>'' and ''X<sub>L</sub>'' have the same value (''X<sub>C</sub>=X<sub>L</sub>''), then the impedance will only be determined by ''ESR''. With frequencies above the resonance the impedance increases again due to the ''ESL'' of the capacitor. At this point, the capacitor begins to behave primarily as an inductance.\n\n===ESR and dissipation factor tan \u03b4===\n<center>\n<gallery caption=\"Typical impedance and ESR curves as a function of frequency and temperature\" class=\"centered\" mode=packed heights=150px>\nFile:Elko-Impedanzverlauf-mit-ESR.svg|Typical impedance and ESR as a function of frequency\nFile: E-cap-100uF-impedance-ESR-curves.jpg|Typical impedance and ESR curves over frequency for different electrolytic capacitor styles compared with MLCC \n</gallery>\n</center>\n\nThe [[equivalent series resistance]] (''ESR'') summarizes all resistive losses of the capacitor. These are the terminal resistances, the contact resistance of the electrode contact, the line resistance of the electrodes, the electrolyte resistance, and the [[dielectric losses]] in the dielectric oxide layer.<ref>A.

Related to the capacitor ESR is accountable for internal heat generation if a [[#ripple current]] flows over the capacitor. This internal heat may influence the reliability of tantalum electrolytic capacitors.\n\nGenerally, the ESR decreases with increasing frequency and temperature.<ref name=DFR>[http://www.dfrsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Uprating-of-Electrolytic-Capacitors.pdf Joelle Arnold, Uprating of Electrolytic Capacitors, DfR Solutions]</ref>\n\nDiscussions of electrolytic capacitors historically sometimes refer to the [[dissipation factor]], ''tan \u03b4'', in the relevant data sheets instead of ''ESR''. The dissipation factor is determined by the tangent of the phase angle between the subtraction of capacitive reactance ''X<sub>C</sub>'' from inductive reactance ''X<sub>L</sub>'', and the ''ESR''. If the capacitor's inductance ''ESL'' is small, the dissipation factor can be approximated as:\n\n: <math>\\tan \\delta = \\mbox{ESR} \\cdot \\omega C</math>\n\nThe dissipation factor ''tan \u03b4'' is used for capacitors with very low losses in frequency determining circuits or [[resonant circuit]]s where the reciprocal value of the dissipation factor is called the [[Q factor|quality factor]] (''Q'') which represents a resonator's [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]].\n\n===Ripple current===\n[[File:rippelstrom mit Schaltplan.png|thumb|250px|The superimposed (DC biased) AC ripple current flow across the smoothing capacitor C1 of a power supply causes internal heat generation corresponding to the capacitors ''ESR'']]\n\nA \"ripple current\" is the [[Root mean square|RMS]] value of a superimposed AC current of any frequency upon a DC current. It arises mainly in power supplies (including [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]]) after rectifying an AC voltage and flows as charge and discharge current through the decoupling or smoothing capacitor.\n\nRipple currents generate heat inside the capacitor body. This dissipation power loss ''P<sub>L</sub>'' is caused by ''ESR'' and is the squared value of the effective (RMS) ripple current ''I<sub>R</sub>''.\n\n: <math>P_{L} = I_R^2 \\cdot ESR</math>\n\nThis internal generated heat, in addition to the ambient temperature and possibly other external heat sources, leads to a capacitor body temperature having a temperature difference of ''\u0394 T'' against the ambient. This heat has to be distributed as thermal losses ''P<sub>th</sub>'' over the capacitors surface ''A'' and the thermal resistance ''\u03b2'' to the ambient.\n\n: <math> P_{th} = \\Delta T \\cdot A \\cdot \\beta</math>\n\nThe internal generated heat has to be distributed to the ambient by [[thermal radiation]], [[convection]], and [[thermal conduction]]. The temperature of the capacitor, which is established on the balance between heat produced and distributed, should not exceed the capacitors maximum specified temperature.\n\nThe ripple current is specified as an effective (RMS) value at 100 or 120&nbsp;Hz or at 10&nbsp;kHz at upper category temperature. Non-sinusoidal ripple currents have to be analyzed and separated into their component sinusoidal frequencies by means of [[Fourier analysis]] and the equivalent ripple current calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual currents.<ref name=VishayIAC />\n\n: <math>I_R=\\sqrt{{i_1}^2 + {i_2}^2  +  {i_3}^2 + {i_n}^2 }</math>\n\nIn solid tantalum electrolytic capacitors the heat generated by the ripple current influences the reliability of the capacitors.<ref>I.

If possible, the voltage profile should be a ramp turn-on, as this reduces the peak current seen by the capacitor.\n\n===Leakage current===\n [[File:Leakage current curves.png|thumb|right|The general leakage current behavior of electrolytic capacitors depend on the kind of electrolyte]]\nThe [[Leakage (electronics)|DC leakage current]] is a special characteristic for electrolytic capacitors other conventional capacitors don\u2019t have. This current is represented by the resistor ''R<sub>leak</sub>'' in parallel with the capacitor in the series-equivalent circuit of electrolytic capacitors. The main causes of leakage current for solid tantalum capacitors are electrical breakdown of the dielectric, conductive paths due to impurities or due to poor anodization, bypassing of dielectric due to excess manganese dioxide, due to moisture paths or due to cathode conductors (carbon, silver).<ref>[http://www.interstatemarketing.com/Papers/TechArticles/Tant-Niobium/leakage.pdf R.W. Franklin, AVX, AN EXPLORATION OF LEAKAGE CURRENT]</ref> This leakage current in solid electrolyte capacitors cannot be reduced by \"healing\" in the sense of generating new oxide because under normal conditions solid electrolytes are unable to deliver oxygen for forming processes. This statement should not be confused with the self-healing process during field crystallization, as described in [[#Reliability (failure rate)|Reliability (failure rate)]].\n\nThe specification of the leakage current in datasheets often will be given by multiplication of the rated capacitance value ''C<sub>R</sub>''  with the value of the rated voltage ''U<sub>R</sub>'' together with an addendum figure, measured after a measuring time of 2 or 5 minutes, for example:   \n:<math>I_\\mathrm{Leak} = 0{.}01\\,\\mathrm{{A}\\over{ V \\cdot F}} \\cdot U_\\mathrm R \\cdot C_\\mathrm R + 3\\,\\mathrm{\\mu A}</math>\n\nThe value of the leakage current depends on the voltage applied, on temperature of the capacitor, on measuring time, and on influence of moisture caused by case sealing conditions. They normally have a very low leakage current, most much lower than the specified worst-case.\n\n===Dielectric absorption (soakage)===\n{{main article|Dielectric absorption}}\n\nDielectric absorption occurs when a capacitor that has remained charged for a long time retains some charge when briefly discharged.

The time of random failures is the time of constant failure rate]]\n\nThe [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] of a component is a property that indicates how well a component performs its function in a time interval. It is subject to a [[stochastic process]] and can be described qualitatively and quantitatively; it is not directly measurable. The reliability of electrolytic capacitors are empirically determined by identifying the [[failure rate]] in production-accompanying [[endurance test]]s,  see [[Reliability engineering#Reliability testing]].\n\nThe reliability normally is shown in a [[bathtub curve]] and is divided into three areas: Early failures or infant mortality failures, constant random failures and wear out failures. Failure types included in the total failure rate are short circuit, open circuit, and degradation failures (exceeding electrical parameters).\n\nThe [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] prediction is generally expressed in a [[Failure rate]] \u03bb, abbreviation '''FIT''' ('''F'''ailures '''I'''n '''T'''ime]. This is the number of failures that can be expected in one billion (10<sup>9</sup>) component-hours of operation (e.g. 1000 components for 1&nbsp;million hours, or 1&nbsp; million components for 1000 hours which is 1&nbsp;ppm/1000 hours) at fixed working conditions during the period of constant random failures. These failure rate model implicitly assume the idea of \"random failure\". Individual components fail at random times but at a predictable rate. The standard operation conditions for the failure rate FIT are 40&nbsp;\u00b0C and 0.5&nbsp;U<sub>R</sub>.\n\nThe reciprocal  value of FIT is [[Mean Time Between Failures|MTBF]] ('''M'''ean '''T'''ime '''B'''etween '''F'''ailures).\n\nFor tantalum capacitors, often the failure rate is specified at 85&nbsp;\u00b0C and rated voltage U<sub>R</sub> as reference conditions and expressed as per cent failed components per thousand hours (n&nbsp;%/1000&nbsp;h). That is \u201cn\u201d number of failed components per 10<sup>5</sup> hours or in FIT the ten-thousand-fold value per 10<sup>9</sup> hours.\n\nFor conditions other than the standard operation conditions 40&nbsp;\u00b0C and 0.5&nbsp;U<sub>R</sub>, for other temperature and voltage applied, for current load, capacitance value, circuit resistance, mechanical influences and humidity, the FIT figure can recalculated with acceleration factors standardized for industrial<ref>IEC/EN 61709, Electric components.

However, they have a single unique failure mode called \u201cfield crystallization\".<ref name=Goudswaard /> Field crystallization is the major reason for degradation and catastrophic failures of solid tantalum capacitors.<ref name=\"How Far\"/> More than 90% of the today's rare failures in tantalum solid-state electrolytic capacitors are caused by shorts or increased leakage current due to this failure mode.<ref>[http://www.elna-america.com/tech_tan_failurerates.php Elna, Failure Rates of Tantalum Chip Capacitors]</ref>\n\nThe extremely thin oxide film of a tantalum electrolytic capacitor, the dielectric layer, must be formed in an amorphous structure. Changing the amorphous structure into a crystallized structure is reported to increase the conductivity by 1000 times, combined with an enlargement of the oxide volume.<ref name=\"FC-Study\"/> The field crystallization followed by a [[dielectric breakdown]] is characterized by a sudden rise in leakage current within a few milliseconds, from nanoamp magnitude to amp magnitude in low-impedance circuits. Increasing current flow can accelerate in an \"avalanche effect\" and rapidly spread through the metal/oxide. This can result in various degrees of destruction from rather small, burned areas on the oxide to zigzag burned streaks covering large areas of the pellet or complete oxidation of the metal.<ref name=VIS-DC /> If the current source is unlimited a field crystallization may cause a capacitor [[short circuit]].  In this circumstance, the failure can be catastrophic if there is nothing to limit the available current, as the series resistance of the capacitor can become very low.\n[[File:Self-Healing Effects-Ta-E-Caps2.jpg|thumb|right|250px| |If the current is limited in tantalum electrolytic capacitors with solid MnO<sub>2</sub> electrolyte, a self-healing process can take place, reducing MnO<sub>2</sub> into insulating Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>]]\n\nImpurities, tiny mechanical damages, or imperfections in the dielectric can affect the structure, changing it from amorphous to crystalline structure and thus lowering the dielectric strength. The purity of the tantalum powder is one of the most important parameters for defining its risk of crystallization. Since the mid-1980s, manufactured tantalum powders have exhibited an increase in purity.\n\nSurge currents after soldering-induced stresses may start crystallization, leading to insulation breakdown.<ref>A. Teverovsky, DERATING OF SURGE CURRENTS FOR TANTALUM CAPACITORS, Dell Services Federal Government, Inc.

Current flowing through the crystallized area causes heating in the manganese dioxide cathode near the fault. At increased temperatures a chemical reaction then reduces the surrounding conductive manganese dioxide to the insulating [[manganese(III) oxide]] (Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and insulates the crystallized oxide in the tantalum oxide layer, stopping local current flow.<ref name=VIS-DC /><ref name=self-healing />\n\n====Failure avoidance====\n\nSolid tantalum capacitors with crystallization are most likely to fail at power-on.<ref>D.

Large sizes capacitors, especially large sizes and high voltage types should be individually protected against sudden discharge of the whole bank due to a failed capacitor.\n\n===Series connection===\nSome applications like [[AC/AC converter]]s with DC-link for frequency controls in [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase grids]] need higher voltages than aluminum electrolytic capacitors usually offer. For such applications electrolytic capacitors can be connected in series for increased voltage withstanding capability. During charging, the voltage across each of the capacitors connected in series is proportional to the inverse of the individual capacitor\u2019s leakage current. Since every capacitor differs a little bit in individual leakage current the capacitors with a higher leakage current will get less voltage. The voltage balance over the series connected capacitors is not symmetrically. Passive or active voltage balance has to be provided in order to stabilize the voltage over each individual capacitor.<ref name=VishayIAC>Vishay BCcomponents, Introduction Aluminum Capacitors, Revision: 10-Sep-13 1 Document Number: 28356, [http://www.vishay.com/docs/28356/alucapsintroduction.pdf PDF]</ref><ref name=EpcosGTI>Epcos, Aluminum electrolytic capacitors, General technical informations [http://www.epcos.de/blob/185386/download/4/pdf-generaltechnicalinformation.pdf PDF]</ref>\n\n===Polarity marking===\n[[File:Polarity-rectangular-chips.jpg|thumb|center|350px|Polarity marking of tantalum electrolytic capacitors]]\n\nAll tantalum capacitors are polarized components, with distinctly marked positive or negative terminals. When subjected to reversed polarity (even briefly), the capacitor depolarizes and the dielectric oxide layer breaks down, which can cause it to fail even when later operated with correct polarity. If the failure is a short circuit (the most common occurrence), and current is not limited to a safe value, catastrophic thermal runaway may occur.\n\nTantalum electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolyte are marked at their positive terminal with a bar or a \"+\". Tantalum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte (axial leaded style) are marked on the negative terminal with a bar or a \u201c-\u201c (minus). The polarity better can be identified on the shaped side of the case, which has the positive terminal. The different marking styles can cause dangerous confusion.\n\n===Imprinted markings===\n\nTantalum capacitors, like most other electronic components and if enough space is available, have imprinted markings to indicate manufacturer, type, electrical and thermal characteristics, and date of manufacture. But most tantalum capacitors are chip types so the reduced space limits the imprinted signs to capacitance, tolerance, voltage and polarity.\n\nSmaller capacitors use a shorthand notation. The most commonly used format is: XYZ J/K/M \u201cV\u201d, where XYZ represents the capacitance (calculated as XY \u00d7 10<sup>Z</sup> pF), the letters K or M indicate the tolerance (\u00b110% and \u00b120% respectively) and \u201cV\u201d represents the working voltage.\n\nExamples:\n\n* 105K 330V implies a capacitance of 10 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> pF = 1 \u00b5F (K = \u00b110%) with a working voltage of 330 V.\n* 476M 100V implies a capacitance of 47 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> pF = 47 \u00b5F (M = \u00b120%) with a working voltage of 100 V.\n\nCapacitance, tolerance and date of manufacture can be indicated with a short code specified in IEC/EN 60062. Examples of short-marking of the rated capacitance (microfarads): \u00b547 = 0,47 \u00b5F, 4\u00b57 = 4,7 \u00b5F, 47\u00b5 = 47 \u00b5F\n\nThe date of manufacture is often printed in accordance with international standards.\n\n* Version 1: coding with year/week numeral code, \"1208\" is \"2012, week number 8\".\n* Version 2: coding with year code/month code. The year codes are: \"R\" = 2003, \"S\"= 2004, \"T\" = 2005, \"U\" = 2006, \"V\" = 2007, \"W\" = 2008, \"X\" = 2009, \"A\" = 2010, \"B\" = 2011, \"C\" = 2012, \"D\" = 2013, \u201cE\u201d = 2014 etc. Month codes are: \"1\" to \"9\" = Jan. to Sept., \"O\" = October, \"N\" = November, \"D\" = December. \"X5\" is then \"2009, May\"\n\nFor very small capacitors no marking is possible. Here only the traceability of the manufacturers can ensure the identification of a type.\n\n===Standardization===\nThe standardization for all [[electrical]], [[electronics|electronic]] components and related technologies follows the rules given by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC),<ref>[http://www.iec.ch/ IEC Homepage]</ref> a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]], non-governmental international [[standards organization]].<ref>[http://webstore.iec.ch/?ref=menu IEC Webstore]</ref><ref>[http://www.beuth.de/de/ IEC/EN/DIN Standards, Beuth-Verlag]</ref>\n\nThe definition of the characteristics and the procedure of the test methods for [[capacitor]]s for use in electronic equipment are set out in the '''Generic specification''':\n\n* IEC/EN 60384-1: Fixed capacitors for use in electronic equipment\n\nThe tests and requirements to be met by aluminum and tantalum electrolytic capacitors for use in electronic equipment for approval as standardized types are set out in the following '''sectional specifications''':\n\n* IEC/EN 60384-3\u2014''Surface mount fixed tantalum electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide solid electrolyte''\n* IEC/EN 60384-15\u2014''fixed tantalum capacitors with non-solid and solid electrolyte''\n* IEC/EN 60384-24\u2014''Surface mount fixed tantalum electrolytic capacitors with conductive polymer solid electrolyte''\n\n===Tantalum ore===\nTantalum capacitors are the main use of the element tantalum. Tantalum ore is one of the [[conflict minerals]]. Some [[non-governmental organization]]s are working together to raise awareness of the relationship between consumer electronic devices and conflict minerals.\n\n===Market===\nThe market of tantalum electrolytic capacitors in 2008 was approximately US$2.2 billion, which was roughly 12% of the total capacitor market.<ref>Electronic Capacitors, SIC 3675, NAICS 334414: Electronic Capacitor Manufacturing, Industry report: [http://business.highbeam.com/industry-reports/equipment/electronic-capacitors]</ref>\n\n===Uses===\nThe low leakage and high capacity of tantalum capacitors favor their use in [[sample and hold]] circuits to achieve long hold duration, and some long duration timing circuits where precise timing is not critical. They are also often used for power supply rail decoupling in parallel with film or [[ceramic capacitor]]s which provide low [[Equivalent series resistance|ESR]] and low [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] at high frequency. Tantalum capacitors can replace aluminum electrolytic capacitors in situations where the external environment or dense component packing results in a sustained hot internal environment and where high reliability is important. Equipment such as medical electronics and space equipment that require high quality and reliability makes use of tantalum capacitors.\n\nAn especially common application for low-voltage tantalum capacitors is power supply [[Filter capacitor|filtering]] on computer motherboards and in peripherals, due to their small size and long-term reliability.<ref name=\"Prymak1998\">{{cite journal |author=Prymak, J.D. |title=New tantalum capacitors in power supply applications |journal=Industry Applications Conference, 1998 |volume=2 |pages=1129\u20131137 |year=1998 |doi=10.1109/IAS.1998.730289 |url= |isbn=0-7803-4943-1}}</ref><ref name=\"Schmitz2007\">Tamara Schmitz and Mike Wong [http://www.planetanalog.com/document.asp?doc_id=527521&site=planetanalog  Choosing and Using Bypass Capacitors]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Aluminum electrolytic capacitor]]\n* [[Electrolytic capacitor]]\n* [[Niobium capacitor]]\n* [[Polymer capacitor]] \n* [[Solid aluminum capacitor (SAL)]]\n* [[Types of capacitor]]\n* [[Surface-mount technology]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Tantalum capacitors}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tantalum Capacitor}}\n[[Category:Capacitors]]\n[[Category:Electronics articles needing expert attention]]"}]}}}}
