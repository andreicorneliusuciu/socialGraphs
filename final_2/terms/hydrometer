The lower the density of the fluid, the deeper the weighted float B sinks. The depth is read off the scale A.]]\n\nA '''hydrometer''' or '''areometer''' is an instrument that measures the [[specific gravity]] ([[relative density]]) of [[liquids]]\u2014the ratio of the density of the liquid to the density of water.\n\nA hydrometer is usually made of [[glass]], and consists of a cylindrical stem and a bulb weighted with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[lead shot]] to make it float upright. The liquid to test is poured into a tall container, often a [[graduated cylinder]], and the hydrometer is gently lowered into the liquid until it floats freely. The point at which the surface of the liquid touches the stem of the hydrometer correlates to specific gravity. Hydrometers usually contain a scale inside the stem, so that the person using it can read specific gravity. A variety of scales exist for different contexts.\n\nHydrometers are calibrated for different uses, such as a lactometer for measuring the density (creaminess) of milk, a saccharometer for measuring the density of sugar in a liquid, or an alcoholometer for measuring higher levels of alcohol in [[Distilled beverage|spirits]].\n\nPrinciple\nOperation of the hydrometer is based on [Archimedes' principle] that a solid suspended in a fluid is buoyed by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the submerged part of the suspended solid. Thus, the lower the density of the substance, the farther the hydrometer sinks. Thus, it is based on the principle of floatation.\n\n==History==\n\nAn early description of a hydrometer appears in a letter from [[Synesius]] of Cyrene to the Greek scholar [[Hypatia of Alexandria]].  In Synesius' fifteenth letter, he requests Hypatia to make a hydrometer for him. Hypatia is given credit for inventing the hydrometer (or hydroscope) sometime in the late 4th century or early 5th century.<ref>Female Inventors - Hypatia of Alexandria http://www.inventions.org/culture/female/hypatia.html</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe instrument in question is a cylindrical tube, which has the shape of a flute and is about the same size. It has notches in a perpendicular line, by means of which we are able to test the weight of the waters. A cone forms a lid at one of the extremities, closely fitted to the tube. The cone and the tube have one base only. This is called the baryllium. Whenever you place the tube in water, it remains erect. You can then count the notches at your ease, and in this way ascertain the weight of the water.<ref>Taken from the two-volume set of Letters, Essays and Hymns of Synesius translated by A.

In fact, it is usual to have two separate instruments, one for heavy liquids, on which the mark 1.000 for water is near the top of the stem, and one for light liquids, on which the mark 1.000 is near the bottom. In many industries a set of hydrometers is used &mdash; covering specific gravity ranges of 1.0&ndash;0.95, 0.95&ndash;0.9 etc. &mdash; to provide more precise measurements.\n\n==Scales==\nModern hydrometers usually measure [[specific gravity]] but different scales were (and sometimes still are) used in certain industries.  Examples include:\n\n* [[API gravity]], universally used worldwide by the petroleum industry.\n* [[Baum\u00e9 scale]], formerly used in industrial chemistry and pharmacology\n* [[Brix]] scale, primarily used in fruit juice, wine making and the sugar industry\n* [[Oechsle scale]], used for measuring the density of [[grape must]]\n* [[Plato scale]], primarily used in brewing\n* [[Twaddell scale]], formerly used in the bleaching and dyeing industries<ref>http://chestofbooks.com/reference/Encyclopedia-Of-Practical-Receipts-And-Processes/Degrees-of-Baum-e.html</ref>\n\n==Specialized hydrometers==\nSpecialized hydrometers are frequently named for their use: a lactometer, for example, is a hydrometer designed especially for use with dairy products.\n\n===Lactometer===\n[[File:Densimetro o galattometro con custodia - Musei del cibo - Parmigiano - 314.tif|thumbnail|Lactometer]]\nA lactometer is used to check purity of cow's milk. The specific gravity of milk does not give a conclusive indication of its composition since milk contains a variety of substances that are either heavier or lighter than water. Additional tests for fat content are necessary to determine overall composition. The instrument is graduated into a hundred parts. Milk is poured in and allowed to stand until the cream has formed, then the depth of the cream deposit in degrees determines the quality of the milk. The device works on the principle of Archimedes' principle that a solid suspended in a fluid is buoyed by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. If the milk sample is pure, then the lactometer floats on it and if it is adulterated or impure, then the lactometer sinks.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n===Alcoholmeter===\n[[File:Alcoholmeter.jpg|thumb|upright|100px|A alcoholometer testing beer immediately after brewing, before fermentation.]]\nAn alcoholmeter is a hydrometer that indicates the alcoholic strength of liquids.  It is also known as a [[Alcoholic proof|proof and Tralles hydrometer]] (after [[Johann Georg Tralles]], but commonly misspelled as '''traille''' and '''tralle'''). It only measures the density of the fluid. Certain assumptions are made to estimate the amount of alcohol present in the fluid. Alcoholometers have scales marked with volume percents of \"potential alcohol\", based on a pre-calculated specific gravity. A higher \"potential alcohol\" reading on this scale is caused by a greater specific gravity, assumed to be caused by the introduction of dissolved sugars.  A reading is taken before and after fermentation and approximate alcohol content is determined by subtracting the post fermentation reading from the pre-fermentation reading.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XRyxWu8rRnQC&pg=PA12&dq=Alcoholometer#v=onepage&q=Alcoholometer&f=false |title=The dictionary of beer and brewing - Google Books |publisher=|accessdate=2009-10-11 }}</ref>\n\n===Saccharometer===\n{{distinguish|saccharimeter}}\n[[File:Saccharometer, Merseyside Maritime Museum.jpg|thumb|right|A 20th century Saccharometer.]]\nA saccharometer is a hydrometer used for determining the amount of sugar in a solution, invented by [[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomas Thomson]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} It is used primarily by [[winemaker]]s and [[brewing|brewers]],<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vDEwIR0ZHGYC&pg=PA64&dq=Saccharometer#v=onepage&q=Saccharometer&f=false |title=Country house brewing in England ... - Google Books |publisher=|accessdate=2009-10-11 }}</ref> and it can also be used in making [[sorbet]]s and ice-creams.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D6YuI15dT74C&pg=PA250&dq=Saccharometer#v=onepage&q=Saccharometer&f=false |title=Patisserie - Google Books |publisher=|accessdate=2009-10-11 }}</ref> The first brewers' saccharometer was constructed by Benjamin Martin (with distillation in mind) and initially used for brewing by James Baverstock Sr in 1770.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=PyU9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA71 |title=The Brewing Industry in England... - Google Books |publisher=|accessdate=2012-03-16 }}</ref>  Henry Thrale adopted its use and it was later popularized by John Richardson in 1784.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AsFdUxOwu8C&pg=RA1-PA312&dq=Saccharometer+John+Richardson#v=onepage&q=Saccharometer%20John%20Richardson&f=false |title=Instruments of science: an ... - Google Books |publisher=|accessdate=2009-10-11 }}</ref>\n\nIt consists of a large weighted glass bulb with a thin stem rising from the top with calibrated markings.  The sugar level can be determined by reading the value where the surface of the liquid crosses the scale. It works by the principle of buoyancy. A solution with a higher sugar content is denser, causing the bulb to float higher. Less sugar results in a lower density and a lower floating bulb.\n\n===Thermohydrometer===\nA thermohydrometer is a hydrometer that has a [[thermometer]] enclosed in the float section. For measuring the density of petroleum products, like fuel oils, the specimen is usually heated in a temperature jacket with a thermometer placed behind it since density is dependent on temperature. Light oils are placed in cooling jackets, typically at 15&nbsp;\u00b0C.\nVery light oils with many volatile components are measured in a variable volume container using a floating [[piston]] sampling device to minimize light end losses.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nAs a battery test it measures the temperature compensated specific gravity and electrolyte temperature.\n\n===Urinometer===\nA [[urinometer]] is a medical hydrometer designed for [[urinalysis]].  As urine's specific gravity is dictated by its ratio of solutes (wastes) to water, a urinometer makes it possible to quickly assess a patient's overall level of hydration.\n\n===Barkometer===\nA barkometer is  calibrated to test the strength of tanning liquors used in tanning [[leather]].<ref>Charles Thomas Davis, {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aS7QAAAAMAAJ&q=Barkometer&dq=Barkometer |title=The manufacture of leather: being a description of all of the processes for the tanning and tawing with bark, extracts, chrome and all modern tannages in general use |publisher=H.

A hydrometer calibrated to read specific gravity relative to water at 60 degrees Fahrenheit is a standard tool for servicing [[car battery|automobile batteries]].  Tables are used to correct the reading to the standard temperature.\n\n===Antifreeze tester===\n[[File:Coolant indicator.jpg|thumb|80px|Device to measure the temperature to which the coolant protects the car from freezing.]]\nAnother automotive use of hydrometers is testing the quality of the [[antifreeze]] solution used for engine cooling. The degree of freeze protection can be related to the density (and so concentration) of the antifreeze; different types of antifreeze have different relations between measured density and freezing point.\n\n===Acidometer===\nSometimes spelled acidimeter, an acidometer is a hydrometer used to measure the specific gravity of an [[acid]].<ref>{{Cite web\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title =Acidometer\n  | work =The Free Dictionary\n  | publisher =Farlex\n  | year =2003\n  | url =http://www.thefreedictionary.com/acidometer\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =18 September 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Use in soil analysis==\nA hydrometer analysis is the process by which fine-grained soils, [[silt]]s and [[clay]]s, are graded. Hydrometer analysis is performed if the grain sizes are too small for [[sieve analysis]]. The basis for this test is [[Stoke's Law]] for falling spheres in a viscous fluid in which the terminal velocity of fall depends on the grain diameter and the densities of the grain in suspension and of the fluid. The grain diameter thus can be calculated from a knowledge of the distance and time of fall. The hydrometer also determines the [[specific gravity]] (or [[density]]) of the suspension, and this enables the percentage of particles of a certain equivalent particle diameter to be calculated.\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin||25em}}\n* [[Elevator paradox (physics)]]\n* [[Gravity (beer)]]\n* [[Oscillating U-tube]]\n* [[Pyknometer]]\n* [[Fahrenheit hydrometer]]\n* [[Dasymeter]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{commons category|Hydrometers}}\n*[http://www.inventions.org/culture/female/hypatia.html Hypatia of Alexandria]\n*[http://www.pressedforwine.com/equipment/hydrometer.shtml Hydrometer Information]\n*[http://www.homebrewing.com/articles/hydrometers.php Guide to Brewing Hydrometers]\n*Jurjen Draaijer.
