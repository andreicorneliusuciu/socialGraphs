Mainframes are defined by [[high availability]], one of the main reasons for their longevity, since they are typically used in applications where downtime would be costly or catastrophic. The term [[Reliability, availability and serviceability (computer hardware)|reliability, availability and serviceability]] (RAS) is a defining characteristic of mainframe computers. Proper planning and implementation is required to exploit these features, and if improperly implemented, may serve to inhibit the benefits provided. In addition, mainframes are more secure than other computer types: the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] vulnerabilities database, US-CERT, rates traditional mainframes such as IBM zSeries, Unisys Dorado and Unisys Libra as among the most secure with vulnerabilities in the low single digits as compared with thousands for Windows, Unix, and Linux.<ref>{{cite web |title=National Vulnerability Database|accessdate=September 20, 2011 |url=http://nvd.nist.gov/home.cfm}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1950s, most mainframes had no explicitly interactive interface. They accepted sets of [[punched cards]], paper tape, or magnetic tape to transfer data and programs. They operated in [[batch processing|batch]] mode to support [[back office]] functions, such as customer billing, and supported interactive terminals almost exclusively for applications rather than program development. [[Typewriter]] and [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] devices were also common control consoles for system operators through the 1970s, although ultimately supplanted by [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]]/[[Display device|display]] devices. By the early 1970s, many mainframes acquired interactive user interfaces<ref group=NB>In some cases the interfaces were introduced in the 1960s, but their deployment became more common in the 1970s</ref> and operated as [[timesharing]] computers, supporting hundreds of users simultaneously along with batch processing. Users gained access through specialized [[Computer terminal|terminals]] or, later, from [[personal computer]]s equipped with [[terminal emulation]] software. By the 1980s, many mainframes supported graphical terminals, and terminal emulation, but not graphical user interfaces. This format of end-user computing reached mainstream obsolescence in the 1990s due to the advent of personal computers provided with GUIs. After 2000, most modern mainframes have partially or entirely phased out classic \"[[Monochrome monitor|green screen]]\" terminal access for end-users in favour of Web-style user interfaces.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nThe infrastructure requirements were drastically reduced during the mid-1990s, when [[CMOS]] mainframe designs replaced the older [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] technology. IBM claimed that its newer mainframes could reduce data center energy costs for power and cooling, and that they could reduce physical space requirements compared to [[server farms]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Get the facts on IBM vs the Competition- The facts about IBM System z \"mainframe\" |publisher=IBM |accessdate=December 28, 2009 |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/migratetoibm/getthefacts/mainframe.html#4}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Inside Z9 2094.jpg|right|thumb|280px|Inside an [[IBM System z9]] mainframe]]\nModern mainframes can run multiple different instances of operating systems at the same time. This technique of [[virtual machine]]s allows applications to run as if they were on physically distinct computers. In this role, a single mainframe can replace higher-functioning hardware services available to conventional [[Server (computing)|servers]]. While mainframes pioneered this capability, virtualization is now available on most families of computer systems, though not always to the same degree or level of sophistication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2551154/virtualization/emulation-or-virtualization-.html|title=Emulation or Virtualization?}}</ref>\n\nMainframes can add or [[hot swap]] system capacity without disrupting system function, with specificity and granularity to a level of sophistication not usually available with most server solutions.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} Modern mainframes, notably the IBM [[zSeries]], [[IBM System z9|System z9]] and [[IBM System z10|System z10]] servers, offer two levels of [[Platform virtualization|virtualization]]: logical partitions ([[LPAR]]s, via the [[PR/SM]] facility) and virtual machines (via the [[z/VM]] operating system). Many mainframe customers run two machines: one in their primary data center, and one in their [[disaster recovery|backup data center]]\u2014fully active, partially active, or on standby\u2014in case there is a catastrophe affecting the first building. Test, development, training, and production workload for applications and databases can run on a single machine, except for extremely large demands where the capacity of one machine might be limiting. Such a two-mainframe installation can support continuous business service, avoiding both planned and unplanned outages. In practice many customers use multiple mainframes linked either by [[Parallel Sysplex]] and shared [[Direct access storage device|DASD]] (in IBM's case),{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} or with shared, geographically dispersed storage provided by EMC or Hitachi.\n\nMainframes are designed to handle very high volume input and output (I/O) and emphasize throughput computing. Since the late-1950s,<ref group=NB>E.g., the [[IBM 709]] had channels in 1958</ref> mainframe designs have included subsidiary hardware<ref group=NB>sometimes computers, sometimes more limited</ref> (called [[System/360#Channels|''channels'']] or [[CDC 6600#Peripheral Processors (PPs)|''peripheral processors'']]) which manage the I/O devices, leaving the CPU free to deal only with high-speed memory. It is common in mainframe shops to deal with massive [[database]]s and files. Gigabyte to terabyte-size record files are not unusual.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wintercorp.com/PressReleases/ttp2005_pressrelease_091405.htm |title=Largest Commercial Database in Winter Corp. TopTen Survey Tops One Hundred Terabytes |accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Press release}}</ref> Compared to a typical PC, mainframes commonly have hundreds to thousands of times as much [[computer storage|data storage]] online,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2006reports/200620056fr.html|title=Improvements in Mainframe Computer Storage Management Practices and Reporting Are Needed to Promote Effective and Efficient Utilization of Disk Resources|quote=Between October 2001 and September 2005, the IRS\u2019 mainframe computer disk storage capacity increased from 79 terabytes to 168.5 terabytes.}}</ref> and can access it reasonably fast. Other server families also offload I/O processing and emphasize throughput computing.\n\nMainframe [[return on investment]] (ROI), like any other computing platform, is dependent on its ability to scale, support mixed workloads, reduce labor costs, deliver uninterrupted service for critical business applications, and several other risk-adjusted cost factors.\n\nMainframes also have execution integrity characteristics for [[fault tolerant]] computing. For example, z900, z990, System z9, and System z10 servers effectively execute result-oriented instructions twice, compare results, arbitrate between any differences (through instruction retry and failure isolation), then shift workloads \"in flight\" to functioning processors, including spares, without any impact to operating systems, applications, or users. This hardware-level feature, also found in HP's [[NonStop]] systems, is known as lock-stepping, because both processors take their \"steps\" (''i.e.'' instructions) together. Not all applications absolutely need the assured integrity that these systems provide, but many do, such as financial transaction processing.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n==Market==\n[[IBM mainframe|IBM]] is a major manufacturer in the mainframe market. [[Unisys]] manufactures [[Burroughs large systems|ClearPath Libra]] mainframes, based on earlier [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs]] products and ClearPath Dorado mainframes based on [[UNIVAC|Sperry Univac]] [[OS 2200|OS 1100]] product lines. In 2002, [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] co-developed the [[zSeries]] z800 with IBM to share expenses, but subsequently the two companies have not collaborated on new Hitachi models. [[Hewlett-Packard]] sells its unique [[NonStop]] systems, which it acquired with [[Tandem Computers]] and which some analysts classify as mainframes. [[Groupe Bull]]'s DPS, [[Fujitsu]] (formerly Siemens) [[BS2000]], and Fujitsu-[[ICL VME]] mainframes are still available in Europe. Fujitsu, Hitachi, and [[NEC]] (the \"JCMs\") still maintain mainframe hardware businesses in the Japanese market.<ref>[http://www.fujitsu.com/global/services/computing/server/mainframe/?custom01=mdd GlobalServer : Fujitsu Global].

Hitachi.co.jp. Retrieved on 2013-07-17.</ref>\n\nThe amount of vendor investment in mainframe development varies with market share. Fujitsu and Hitachi both continue to use custom S/390-compatible processors, as well as other CPUs (including POWER and Xeon) for lower-end systems. Bull uses a mixture of [[Itanium]] and [[Xeon]] processors. NEC uses Xeon processors for its low-end [[Advanced Comprehensive Operating System|ACOS-2]] line, but develops the custom NOAH-6 processor for its high-end ACOS-4 series. IBM continues to pursue a different business strategy of mainframe investment and growth.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} IBM has its own large research and development organization designing new, homegrown CPUs, including mainframe processors such as 2012's 5.5&nbsp;GHz six-core [[IBM zEnterprise System#zEnterprise EC12|zEC12]] mainframe microprocessor. Unisys produces code compatible mainframe systems that range from laptops to cabinet sized mainframes that utilize homegrown CPUs as well as [[Xeon]] processors. IBM is rapidly expanding its software business, including its mainframe software portfolio, to seek additional revenue and profits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enterprisenetworksandservers.com/monthly/art.php?3306|title=IBM Opens Latin America's First Mainframe Software Center|publisher=Enterprise Networks and Servers|date=August 2007}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, there exists a market for software applications to manage the performance of mainframe implementations. In addition to IBM, significant players in this market include [[BMC Software|BMC]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Mainframe Automation Management|url=http://www.bmc.com/solutions/msm-functional/mf-automation-management.html|accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref> [[Compuware]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Mainframe Modernization|url=http://www.compuware.com/mainframe-solutions/workbench-mainframe-modernization.html|accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Automated Mainframe Testing & Auditing|url=http://www.compuware.com/en_us/mainframe-solutions/products/hiperstation-automated-mainframe-testing.html|accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref> and [[CA Technologies]].<ref>{{cite web|title=CA Technologies|url=http://www.ca.com/us/default.aspx}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2008}}\n[[File:IBM 704 mainframe.gif|right|thumb|280px|An [[IBM 704]] mainframe (1964)]]\nSeveral manufacturers produced mainframe computers from the late 1950s through the 1970s. The group of manufacturers was first known as \"[[BUNCH|IBM and the Seven Dwarfs]]\":<ref>{{cite book|last=Bergin|first=Thomas J (ed.)|title=50 Years of Army Computing: From ENIAC to MSRC|year=2000|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=0-9702316-1-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iAr_Z1B494MC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>{{rp|p.83}}  usually [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs]], [[UNIVAC]], [[NCR Corporation|NCR]], [[Control Data Corporation|Control Data]], [[Honeywell Corporation|Honeywell]], [[General Electric]] and [[RCA]], although some lists varied.  Later, with the departure of General Electric and RCA, it was referred to as IBM and the [[BUNCH]]. IBM's dominance grew out of their [[IBM 700/7000 series|700/7000 series]] and, later, the development of the [[System/360|360]] series mainframes. The latter architecture has continued to evolve into their current zSeries mainframes which, along with the then Burroughs and Sperry (now [[Unisys]]) [[Burroughs large systems|MCP]]-based and [[OS2200|OS1100]]  mainframes, are among the few mainframe architectures still extant that can trace their roots to this early period. While IBM's zSeries can still run 24-bit System/360 code, the 64-bit zSeries and System z9 CMOS servers have nothing physically in common with the older systems. Notable manufacturers outside the US were [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] and [[Telefunken]] in [[Germany]], [[International Computers Limited|ICL]] in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Olivetti]] in Italy, and [[Fujitsu]], [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]], [[Oki Electric Industry|Oki]], and [[NEC]] in [[Japan]]. The [[Soviet Union]] and [[Warsaw Pact]] countries manufactured close copies of IBM mainframes during the [[Cold War]]; the [[BESM]] series and [[Strela computer|Strela]] are examples of an independently designed Soviet computer.\n\nShrinking demand and tough competition started a [[shakeout]] in the market in the early 1970s\u2014RCA sold out to UNIVAC and GE sold its business to Honeywell; in the 1980s Honeywell was bought out by [[Bull (company)|Bull]]; UNIVAC became a division of [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]], which later merged with Burroughs to form [[Unisys]] Corporation in 1986.\n\nDuring the 1980s, [[minicomputer]]-based systems grew more sophisticated and were able to displace the lower-end of the mainframes.  These computers, sometimes called ''departmental computers'' were typified by the DEC [[VAX]].\n\nIn 1991, [[AT&T Corporation]] briefly owned NCR. During the same period, companies found that servers based on microcomputer designs could be deployed at a fraction of the acquisition price and offer local users much greater control over their own systems given the IT policies and practices at that time. Terminals used for interacting with mainframe systems were gradually replaced by [[personal computer]]s. Consequently, demand plummeted and new mainframe installations were restricted mainly to financial services and government. In the early 1990s, there was a rough consensus among industry analysts that the mainframe was a dying market as mainframe platforms were increasingly replaced by personal computer networks. [[InfoWorld]]'s [[Stewart Alsop II|Stewart Alsop]] famously predicted that the last mainframe would be unplugged in 1996; in 1993, he cited Cheryl Currid, a computer industry analyst as saying that the last mainframe \"will stop working on December 31, 1999\",<ref>{{cite news|last=Alsop|first=Stewart|title=IBM still has brains to be player in client/server platforms|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=XTwEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA1&vq=death%20mainframe&pg=PA4#v=onepage&q=death%20mainframe&f=false|accessdate=Dec 26, 2013|newspaper=InfoWorld|date=Mar 8, 1993}}</ref> a reference to the anticipated [[Year 2000 problem]] (Y2K).\n\nThat trend started to turn around in the late 1990s as corporations found new uses for their existing mainframes and as the price of data networking collapsed in most parts of the world, encouraging trends toward more centralized computing. The growth of [[e-business]] also dramatically increased the number of back-end transactions processed by mainframe software as well as the size and throughput of databases. Batch processing, such as billing, became even more important (and larger) with the growth of e-business, and mainframes are particularly adept at large scale batch computing. Another factor currently increasing mainframe use is the development of the [[Linux on z Systems|Linux]] operating system, which arrived on IBM mainframe systems in 1999 and is typically run in scores or hundreds of virtual machines on a single mainframe. Linux allows users to take advantage of [[open source]] software combined with mainframe hardware [[Reliability, availability and serviceability (computer hardware)|RAS]]. Rapid expansion and development in [[emerging markets]], particularly [[People's Republic of China]], is also spurring major mainframe investments to solve exceptionally difficult computing problems, e.g. providing unified, extremely high volume online transaction processing databases for 1 billion consumers across multiple industries (banking, insurance, credit reporting, government services, etc.) In late 2000, IBM introduced 64-bit [[z/Architecture]], acquired numerous software companies such as [[Cognos]] and introduced those software products to the mainframe. IBM's quarterly and annual reports in the 2000s usually reported increasing mainframe revenues and capacity shipments. However, IBM's mainframe hardware business has not been immune to the recent overall downturn in the server hardware market or to model cycle effects. For example, in the 4th quarter of 2009, IBM's [[IBM System z|System z]] hardware revenues decreased by 27% year over year. But MIPS shipments increased 4% per year over the past two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/investor/4q09/presentation/4q09prepared.pdf|title=IBM 4Q2009 Financial Report: CFO's Prepared Remarks|publisher=[[IBM]]|date=January 19, 2010}}</ref> Alsop had himself photographed in 2000, symbolically eating his own words (\"death of the mainframe\").<ref>{{cite web|title=Stewart Alsop eating his words|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/mainframe-computers/7/182/734|work=Computer History Museum|accessdate=Dec 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, [[NASA]] powered down its last mainframe, an IBM System z9.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cureton|first=Linda|url=http://blogs.nasa.gov/NASA-CIO-Blog/2012/02/12/post_1329017818806/|title=The End of the Mainframe Era at NASA|publisher=[[NASA]]|date=11 February 2012|accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref> However, IBM's successor to the z9, the [[IBM System z10|z10]], led a New York Times reporter to state four years earlier that \"mainframe technology&nbsp;\u2014 hardware, software and services&nbsp;\u2014 remains a large and lucrative business for I.B.M., and mainframes are still the back-office engines behind the world\u2019s financial markets and much of global commerce\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Lohr |first=Steve |title=Why Old Technologies Are Still Kicking |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/23/technology/23digi.html |accessdate=Dec 25, 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 23, 2008}}</ref> {{As of|2010}}, while mainframe technology represented less than 3% of IBM's revenues, it \"continue[d] to play an outsized role in Big Blue's results\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Ante|first=Spencer E.|title=IBM Calculates New Mainframes Into Its Future Sales Growth|url=http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703954804575381482738207168|accessdate=Dec 25, 2013|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 22, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, IBM launched its most recent generation mainframe, the IBM z13.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/08/21/from-ibm-mainframe-users-group-to-apple-welcome-ibm-seriously-this-week-in-tech-history/#5a66bba2781f|title=From IBM Mainframe Users Group To Apple 'Welcome IBM.

Supercomputers are used for scientific and engineering problems ([[high-performance computing]]) which are data crunching and number crunching,<ref>[http://www.graphanalysis.org/ High-Performance Graph Analysis] Retrieved on February 15, 2012</ref> while mainframes are used for transaction processing. The differences are as follows:\n\n* Mainframes are built to be reliable for [[transaction processing]] (measured by [[Transaction Processing Performance Council|TPC]]-metrics; not used or very helpful for most supercomputing applications) as it is commonly understood in the business world: a commercial exchange of goods, services, or money.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} A typical transaction, as defined by the [[Transaction Processing Performance Council]],<ref>[http://www.tpc.org/information/about/abouttpc.asp Transaction Processing Performance Council] Retrieved on December 25, 2009.</ref> would include the updating to a database system for such things as inventory control (goods), airline reservations (services), or banking (money). A transaction could refer to a set of operations including disk read/writes, operating system calls, or some form of data transfer from one subsystem to another. This operation doesn't count toward the processing power of a computer. Transaction processing is not exclusive to mainframes but also used in the performance of microprocessor-based servers and online networks.\n* Supercomputers are measured in [[floating point]] operations per second ([[FLOPS]])<ref>[http://www.top500.org/ The \"Top 500\" list of High Performance Computing (HPC) systems] Retrieved on July 19, 2016</ref> or in [[traversed edges per second]] or TEPS;<ref>[http://www.graph500.org/ The Graph 500] Retrieved on February 19, 2012</ref> metrics that are not very meaningful for mainframe applications; while mainframes are sometimes approximately measured in millions of instructions per second ([[instructions per second|MIPS]]),<ref>Resource consumption for billing and performance purposes is measured in units of a [[million service units]] (MSUs), but the definition of MSU varies from processor to processor in such a fashion as to make MSU's/s useless for comparing processor performance.</ref> (a metric not used on supercomputers; as not very helpful, it's arguably neither for mainframes to measure real performance of the transaction processing goal, but such or similar sub-component of it, may be used for billing purposes). Examples of integer operations (the instructions counted by MIPS) include adding numbers together, checking values or moving data around in memory (while moving information to and from storage, so-called [[input/output|I/O]] is most helpful for mainframes; and within memory, only helping indirectly). Floating point operations are mostly addition, subtraction, and multiplication (of [[IEEE 754-1985|''binary'' floating point]] in supercomputers; measured by FLOPS) with enough digits of precision to model continuous phenomena such as weather prediction and nuclear simulations (only recently standardized [[decimal floating point|''decimal'' floating point]], not used in supercomputers, are appropriate from [[monetary]] values such as those useful for mainframe applications).
