The earliest recorded use of the term, in 1870, referred to [[indigenous peoples]] in areas colonized by Europeans. By the 20th century, the term came to describe fossils which were [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]] similar, but not identical, to those of the human [[skeleton]].<ref name=\"OED\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=humanoid, n. and adj. |work=OED Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=15 June 2015}}</ref> Although this usage was common in the sciences for much of the 20th century, it is now considered rare.<ref name=\"OED\"/> More generally, the term can refer to anything with uniquely human characteristics and/or adaptations, such as possessing [[opposable]] [[anterior]] [[forelimb]]-[[appendage]]s (thumbs), [[visible spectrum]]-[[binocular vision]] (having two eyes), or [[biomechanic]] [[digitigrade]]-[[bipedalism]] (the ability to walk on heels in an upright position).\n\n==In theoretical convergent evolution==\n{{see also|Convergent evolution|dinosaur intelligence}}\n\nAlthough there are no known humanoid species outside the genus ''[[Homo]]'', the theory of [[convergent evolution]] speculates that different species may evolve similar traits, and in the case of a humanoid these traits may include [[intelligence]] and [[bipedal]]ism and other humanoid [[Human skeletal changes due to bipedalism|skeletal changes]],  as a result of similar [[evolution]]ary pressures. American psychologist and [[Dinosaur intelligence]] theorist [[Harry Jerison]] suggested the possibility of sapient dinosaurs. In a 1978 presentation at the [[American Psychological Association]], he speculated that [[dromiceiomimus]] could have evolved into a highly intelligent species like human beings.<ref name=\"kaneko\">{{cite book|last1=Kaneko|first1=Ry\u016bichi|title=Shin ky\u014dry\u016b densetsu : Saiko ky\u014dry\u016b eoraputoru kara ky\u014dry\u016b jinrui made ky\u014dry\u016bgaku no saisentan|trans_title=<!--provisional translation-->New dinosaur book: The front-lines of dinosaurology, from Eoraptor as the earliest dinosaur to Sapient dinosaurs|year=1997|publisher=Hayakawashob\u014d|location=Tokyo|language=Japanese|isbn=978-4-15-050211-9|pages=204\u2013206}}</ref> In his book, ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]] argues that if the tape of life were re-wound and played back, life would have taken a very different course.<ref name=\"wonderfullife\">{{cite book| title=[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History| author=Gould, S.J.| authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould| year=1989| publisher=W.W.

Over geologic time, Russell noted that there had been a steady increase in the [[encephalization quotient]] or EQ (the relative brain weight when compared to other species with the same body weight) among the dinosaurs.<ref name=\"cosm\">[http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/features/print/1444/smartasaurus Cosmos: Smartosarus]</ref> Russell had discovered the first Troodontid skull, and noted that, while its EQ was low compared to humans, it was six times higher than that of other dinosaurs. If the trend in ''Troodon'' evolution had continued to the present, its brain case could by now measure 1,100&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>; comparable to that of a human. [[Troodontid]]s had semi-manipulative fingers, able to grasp and hold objects to a certain degree, and binocular vision.<ref name=russell1982>{{Cite journal | last1 = Russell | first1 = D.

As with most modern reptiles (and birds), he conceived of its genitalia as internal. Russell speculated that it would have required a navel, as a placenta aids the development of a large brain case. However, it would not have possessed mammary glands, and would have fed its young, as birds do, on regurgitated food. He speculated that its language would have sounded somewhat like [[bird song]].<ref name=russell1982/><ref name=\"nash\">Naish, D. (2006).

[[Gregory S. Paul]] (1988) and [[Thomas R. Holtz, Jr.]], consider it \"suspiciously human\" (Paul, 1988) and [[Darren Naish]] has argued that a large-brained, highly intelligent troodontid would retain a more standard theropod body plan, with a horizontal posture and long tail, and would probably manipulate objects with the snout and feet in the manner of a bird, rather than with human-like \"hands\".<ref name=nash/>\n\n==In robotics==\n{{Main|Humanoid robot}}\nA ''humanoid robot'' is a robot that is based on the general structure of a human, such as a robot that walks on two legs and has an upper torso, or a robot that has two arms, two legs and a head. A humanoid robot does not necessarily look convincingly like a real person, for example the [[ASIMO]] humanoid robot has a helmet instead of a face.\n\nAn ''[[Android (robot)|android]]'' (male) or ''[[gynoid]]'' (female) is a humanoid robot designed to look as much like a real person as possible, although these words are frequently perceived to be synonymous with humanoid.\n\nWhile there are many humanoid robots in fictional stories, some real [[humanoid robot]]s have been developed since the 1990s, and some real human-looking android robots have been developed since 2002.\n\nSimilarly to robots, virtual [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] may also be called humanoid when resembling humans.\n\n==In mythology==\n{{main|Mythic humanoids}}\n[[Deities]] are often imagined in [[anthropomorphism|human shape]] (also known as \"[[anthropotheism]]\"), sometimes as [[mythological hybrid|hybrids]] (especially the [[nefer|gods]] of [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]). \nA fragment by the Greek poet [[Xenophanes]] describes this tendency, \n{{quote|...Men make gods in their own image; those of the [[Aethiopia|Ethiopians]] are black and narrow-nosed, those of the [[Thracians]] have blue eyes and red hair.<ref>Diels, B16,''Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'', 1903, pp.38\u201358 (Xenophanes fr. B16, Diels-Kranz, Kirk/Raven no. 171 [= Clem. Alex. Strom. Vii.4]</ref>}}\nIn [[animism]] in general, the [[spirits]] innate in certain objects (like the Greek [[nymph]]s) are typically depicted in human shape, e.g. spirits of trees ([[Dryads]]), of the woodlands (the hybrid [[faun]]s), of wells or waterways ([[Nereids]], [[Neck (water spirit)|Necks]]), etc.\n\n==In science fiction==\nWith regard to [[extraterrestrials in fiction]], the term humanoid is most commonly used to refer to [[Extraterrestrial life|alien beings]] with a [[body plan]] that is generally like that of a human, including upright stance and [[bipedalism]].\n\nMany aliens in [[television]] and [[science fiction film]]s are presented as humanoid.  This is usually attributed to budget constraints, as human actors can more easily portray human-like aliens. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n===Fictional extraterrestrials===\n\nIn much of [[science fiction]], the reason for the abundance of humanoid aliens is not explained and requires [[suspension of disbelief]]. In some cases, however, explanations have been offered for this. In ''[[Star Trek]]'', the abundance of humanoid aliens within the ''Star Trek'' universe is explained by advancing the story of a primordial humanoid civilization, the [[Ancient humanoid (Star Trek)|Ancient humanoid]]s, who seeded the galaxy with genetically-engineered cells to guide the evolution of life on a multitude of worlds toward a humanoid form.<ref>{{Cite episode\n | title = The Chase\n | episodelink = The Chase (Star Trek: The Next Generation)\n | series = Star Trek: The Next Generation\n | serieslink = Star Trek: The Next Generation\n | airdate = April 26, 1993\n | season = 6\n | number = 20 }}</ref> In the television series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', the [[Jaffa (Stargate)|Jaffa]] are explained as being an hundred-thousand year offshoot of humanity bred by the [[Goa'uld]] to suit their purposes, hence their almost-human appearance and physiology, while many other \"alien\" characters are actually the descendants of human-[[slaves]] who were removed from Earth by the Goa'uld. Here on Earth, any species segregated from the main genus for at least 10k years may be considered a new sub-species; any humans isolated on multiple planets after 100k+ years of adaptations would most certainly seem \"alien\" to Earthlings. Similarly, in its spin-off show ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', the explanation offered for the humanoid appearance of the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]] is that the Wraith evolved from a parasite which incorporated human [[DNA]] into its own [[genome]] after feeding on humans, giving the Wraith their present form.<ref name=\"The Gift\">{{sgcite|The Gift|Atlantis|show=ref}}</ref>\n\n==In ufology==\nIn the field of [[ufology]], ''humanoid'' refers to any of the claimed [[extraterrestrials]] which abduct human victims, such as the [[Grey alien|Greys]],<ref>{{cite book| last = Bryan| first = C.D.B| title = Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind| year = 1995| publisher = Alfred A.

In some cases, such as older versions of the game Dungeons and Dragons, a distinction is made between [[demi-humans]], which are relatively similar to humans, and humanoids, which exhibit larger differences from humans. Animals that are humanoid are also shown in fantasy. \nHumanoids are also used in some old horror movies, for example in [[Creature From the Black Lagoon]], made in 1954 by [[Jack Arnold (director)|Jack Arnold]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Anthropomorphism]]\n*[[Hominid (term)]]\n*[[Human disguise]]\n*[[Panspermia]]\n*[[Race (fantasy)]]\n*[[Robotics]]\n\n;Lists\n*[[List of fictional humanoid species]]\n**[[List of piscine and amphibian humanoids]]\n**[[List of reptilian humanoids]]\n**[[List of avian humanoids]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.robotinfo.net Robot Info (Directory of Robotics news, books, videos, magazines, forums and products)].\n*[http://www.maniacworld.com/Humanoid-Robot.html Humanoid Robot] Video\n*[http://www.roboporium.com/ Humanoid Robots in America]\n\n{{Humanoid robots|state=uncollapsed}}\n{{Androids}}\n{{Robotics}}\n\n[[Category:Humanoids| ]]"}]}}}}
