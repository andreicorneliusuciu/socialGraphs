Examples are user guides, white papers, on-line help, quick-reference guides.  It is becoming less common to see paper (hard-copy) documentation.  Documentation is distributed via websites, software products, and other on-line applications.\n\nProfessionals educated in this field are termed documentalists. This field changed its name to [[information science]] in 1968, but some uses of the term documentation still exists and there have been efforts to reintroduce the term documentation as a field of study.\n\n== Principles for producing documentation ==\n\nWhile associated [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards are not easily available publicly, a guide from other sources for this topic may serve the purpose.<ref name=agd>{{cite web|last=N/A |first= |authorlink= |title=Guide to Documentation |work= |publisher= |year=2003 |url=http://www.somers.k12.ct.us/common/guide_to_doc.pdf |format= |doi= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070729135707/http://www.somers.k12.ct.us/common/guide_to_doc.pdf |archivedate=29 July 2007 }}</ref><sup>,</sup> <ref name=agds>{{cite web\n  | last = CGRP\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = A Guide to Documentation Styles\n  | work =\n  | publisher =\n  | url = http://www.sfsu.edu/~carp1/pdf/A%20Guide%20to%20Documentation%20Styles.pdf\n  | format =\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 12 June 2009\n  }}</ref><sup>,</sup>.<ref name=agmd>{{cite web|last=N/A |first= |authorlink= |title=A guide to MLA documentation |work= |publisher= |url=http://www.sunyjcc.edu/jamestown/library/pdf/mla.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=12 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902180310/http://www.sunyjcc.edu/jamestown/library/pdf/mla.pdf |archivedate=2 September 2006 }}</ref> David Berger has provided several principles of document writing, regarding the terms used, procedure numbering and even lengths of sentences, etc.<ref name=pad>{{cite web\n  | last = Berger\n  | first = David\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = Procedures and Documentation\n  | work =\n  | publisher =\n  | url = http://www.maintenanceonline.org/maintenanceonline/content_images/p11%20Trans%20View-20080410-222135.pdf\n  | format =\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 15 June 2009\n  }}</ref>\n\n=== Guidelines ===\nThe following is a list of guides dealing with each specific field and type:\n* documentation in health care<ref name=cgd2>{{cite book |last=Springhouse |title=Complete Guide to Documentation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1fPFVJIi6gC&pg=PA87&dq=intitle:documentation&lr=&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=1&as_miny_is=2005&as_maxm_is=6&as_maxy_is=2009&as_brr=0#PPP1,M1 |accessdate=12 June 2009}}</ref>\n* thesis writing<ref name=twtu>{{cite web |last=Tampere University of Technology |title=Thesis Writing at the Tampere University of Technology |url=http://www.tut.fi/public/english/Guide/thesisguide.pdf |accessdate=12 June 2009}}</ref><ref name=gwgt>{{cite web|last=Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Prince Edward Island |title=A Guide for the Writing of Graduate Theses |url=http://www.upei.ca/avc/files/avc/guidetowritingthesis.pdf |accessdate=12 June 2009}}</ref><ref name=wsdt>{{cite web |last=University of Waikato |title=Writing and Submitting a Dissertation or Thesis at the University of Waikato |url=http://www.waikato.ac.nz/library/learning/g_thesis.pdf |accessdate=12 June 2009}}</ref> {{Further|Dissertation}}\n* papers for academic journal publishing (i.e., ''[[Journal of Food Science]]''<ref name=js>{{cite web |last=''[[Journal of Food Science]]''|title=Manuscript Submission |url=http://members.ift.org/IFT/Pubs/JournalofFoodSci/jfsmanuscripts/ |accessdate=12 June 2009}}</ref> and ''[[Analytical Chemistry (journal)|Analytical Chemistry]]''<ref name=ifa>{{cite web |last=[[Analytical Chemistry (journal)|''Analytical Chemistry'']] |title=Information for Authors |url=http://pubs.acs.org/page/ancham/submission/authors.html |accessdate=12 June 2009}}</ref>)\n\n=== Procedures and techniques ===\n\nThe procedures of documentation vary from one sector, or one type, to another. In general, these may involve document drafting, formatting, submitting, reviewing, approving, distributing, reposting and tracking, etc., and are convened by associated [[Standing operating procedure|SOP]]s in a regulatory industry. It could also involve creating content from scratch. Documentation should be easy to read and understand. If it's too long and too wordy, it may be misunderstood or ignored. Clear, Short, Familiar words should be used to a maximum of 15 words to a sentence. Only gender hyper neutral word should be used and cultural biases should be avoided. Procedures should be numbered when they are to be performed.<ref name=grdp>{{cite web\n  | last = Cropper\n  | first = Mark\n  | authorlink =\n  |author2=Tony Dibbens\n  | title = GAIA-RVS Documentation Procedures\n  | work =\n  | publisher =\n  | year = 2002\n  | url = http://www.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/gaia-rvs/document_repository/MSSL_GAIA-RVS_AD_001.01.pdf\n  | format =\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 15 June 2009\n  }}</ref><sup>,</sup> <ref name=gqsd>{{cite web|last=N/A |first= |authorlink= |title=GLNPO's Quality System Documentation Review Procedures and Tracking |work= |publisher= |url=http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/qmp/Appendix%20S/Quality_Doc_Review_Procedures.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=15 June 2009 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><sup>,</sup> <ref name=dspg>{{cite web\n  | last = UK Data Archive\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = Data Services Process Guides: Documentation Processing Procedures\n  | work =\n  | publisher =\n  | year = 2009\n  | url = http://www.esds.ac.uk/news/publications/UKDA_DSS_DocumentationProcessingProcedures.pdf\n  | format =\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 15 June 2009\n  }}</ref><sup>,</sup>.<ref name=dspg2>{{cite web|last=UK Data Archive |first= |authorlink= |title=Data Services Process Guides: Documentation Processing Techniques |work= |publisher= |url=http://www.esds.ac.uk/news/publications/UKDADocProcessingTechniques.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=15 June 2009 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n== Producing documentation ==\n\nTechnical writers and corporate communicators are professionals whose field and work is documentation. Ideally, technical writers have a background in both the subject matter and also in writing and managing content (information architecture). Technical writers more commonly collaborate with subject matter experts (SMEs), such as engineers, technical experts,  medical professionals, or other types of clients to define and then create content (documentation) that meets the user's needs. Corporate communications includes other types of written documentation that is required for most companies.\n\n=== Specializing documentation ===\n\n* [[Marketing Communications]] (MarCom): MarCom writers endeavor to convey the company's value proposition through a variety of print, electronic, and social media.  This area of corporate writing is often engaged in responding to proposals.\n* [[Technical Communication]] (TechCom): Technical writers document a company's product or service.  Technical publication include user guides, installation an configuration manuals, and troubleshooting/repair/replace procedures.\n* [[Legal Writing]]: This type of documentation is often prepared by attorneys or paralegals who could be in private practice or retained as corporate council.\n* Compliance documentation: This type of documentation codifies [[Standard Operating Procedures]] (SOPs), for any regulatory compliance needs, as for safety approval, taxation, financing, technical approval, etc.\n*\n\n=== Indexing ===\n\n* [[Index (database)]]\n* [[Index (search engine)]]\n{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}\n{{Further|Document management system}}\n\n== Documentation in computer science ==\n{{main|Software documentation}}\nThe following are typical software documentation types\n* Request for Proposal ([[RFP]])\n* Requirements/ [[Statement of work]]/ Scope of Work (SOW)\n* Software Design and Functional Specification\n* System Design and Functional Specifications\n* Change Management, Error and Enhancement Tracking\n* [[User Acceptance Testing]]\n\nThe following are typical hardware and service documentation types\n* [[Computer network diagram|network diagrams]]\n* network maps\n* [[datasheet]] for IT systems (Server, Switch, e.g.)\n* Service Catalog and Service Portfolio ([[Information Technology Infrastructure Library|ITIL]])\n\nDocumentation include such as feasibility report, technical documentation, operational documentation, log book, etc.\n\n=== Tools for documenting software ===\n\nThere are many types of software and applications used to create documentation.\n\nSOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION FOLDER (SDF)\n\nA common type of software document written by software engineers in the simulation industry is the SDF. When developing software for a simulator, which can range from embedded avionics devices to 3D terrain databases by way of full motion control systems, the engineer keeps a notebook detailing the development \"the build\" of the project or module. The document can be a wiki page, MS word document or other environment.  They should contain a ''requirements'' section, an ''interface'' section to detail the communication interface of the software.  Often a ''notes'' section is used to detail the proof of concept, and then track errors and enhancements. Finally, a ''testing'' section to document how the software was tested.  This documents conformance to the client's requirements. The result is a detailed description of how the software is designed, how to build and install the software on the target device, and any known defects and work-arounds. This build document enables future developers and maintainers to come up to speed on the software in a timely manner, and also provides a roadmap to modifying code or searching for bugs.\n\nSOFTWARE FOR NETWORK INVENTORY AND CONFIGURATION ([[CMDB]])\n\nThese software tools can automatically collect data of your network equipment. The data could be for inventory and for configuration information. The [[ITIL|ITIL Library]] requests to create such a database as a basis for all information for the IT responsible. It's also the basis for IT documentation.\n\n== Documentation in criminal justice ==\n\n\"Documentation\" is the preferred term for the process of populating criminal databases.  Examples include the [[National Counter-terrorism Center]]'s [[Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment]] (\"TIDE\"), [[sex offender registries]], and gang databases.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rader Brown|first=Rebecca|title=The Gang's All Here: Evaluating the Need for a National Gang Database|journal=Columbia Journal of Law and Social Problems|year=2009|volume=42|pages=293\u2013333}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Author]]ing\n* [[Bibliographic control]]\n* [[Change control]]\n* [[Citation|Citation Index]]\n* [[Copyright]]\n* [[Description]]\n* [[Document]]\n* [[Documentation (field)]]\n* [[Digital object identifier|Document identifier]]\n{{col-3}}\n* [[Document management system]]\n* [[Documentary film|Documentary]]\n* [[Freedom of information]]\n* [[Glossary]]\n* [[Historical document]]\n* [[Index (publishing)]]\n* [[ISO 690]]\n* [[ISO 5964]]\n* [[ISO 9001]]\n*[[IEC 61355]]\n{{col-3}}\n* [[International Standard Bibliographic Description]]\n* [[Licensing]]\n* [[Table of contents|List of Contents]]\n* [[Manual (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Medical certificate]]\n* [[Publishing]]\n* [[Records management]]\n* [[Style guide]]\n* [[Technical communication]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* [http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/pcs/  IEEE Professional Communication Society]\n* [http://www.linfo.org/documentation.html  Documentation Definition] by The Linux Information Project (LINFO)\n* [http://www.problemistics.org/tools/references/information.html  Information & Documentation] List of selected tools\n* Library of articles on documentation: [http://www.hci.com.au/hcisite5/library/default.htm Technical writing and documentation articles]\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2011}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Technical communication]]\n[[Category:Information science]]"}]}}}}
