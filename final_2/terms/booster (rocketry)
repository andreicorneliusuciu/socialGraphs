(Boosters used in this way are frequently designated \"zero stages\".) Boosters are traditionally necessary to launch [[spacecraft]] into [[low Earth orbit]] (absent a [[single-stage-to-orbit]] design), and are certainly necessary for a space vehicle to go beyond Earth orbit. The booster is dropped to fall back to Earth once its fuel is expended, a point known as '''booster engine cut-off''' (BECO). The rest of the launch vehicle continues flight with its core or upper-stage engines. The booster may be recovered and reused, as in the case of the [[Space Shuttle]].\n\nStrap-on boosters are sometimes used to augment the payload or range capability of jet aircraft (usually military).\n\n==Drop-away engines==\nThe [[SM-65 Atlas]] rocket used three engines, one of which was fixed to the fuel tank, and two of which were mounted on a skirt which dropped away at [[BECO]]. This was used as an [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM); to launch the manned [[Project Mercury]] capsule into orbit; and as the first stage of the [[Atlas-Agena]] and [[Atlas-Centaur]] launch vehicles.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n==Strap-on boosters==\n{{also|Modular rocket}}\nThe [[Titan III]], used by the [[United States Air Force]] as an unmanned heavy-lift vehicle, was developed from the [[Titan II]] launch vehicle by adding a pair of strap-on [[solid rocket booster]]s (SRB). It was also planned to be used for the [[Manned Orbital Laboratory]] program, which was cancelled in 1969.\n\n[[NASA]]'s [[Space Shuttle]] was the first manned vehicle to use solid-fueled boosters as strap-ons. The solid boosters consisted of stacked segments, and were recovered and reused multiple times.\n\n==Recoverable boosters==\n\nThe [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster#Descent and recovery|booster casings]] for the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster]] were recovered and refurbished for reuse from 1981\u20132011 as part of the [[Space Shuttle program]].\n\nIn a new development program initiated in 2011, [[SpaceX]] [[SpaceX reusable launch system development program|developed technologies]] to facilitate the [[Return To Launch Site|return]], [[VTVL|vertical landing]], and recovery for low-cost and rapid reuse of a [[SpaceX recoverable booster|recoverable booster]].<ref name=\"wp20110929\">{{cite news |title=SpaceX chief details reusable rocket |work=Washington Post |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=December 30, 2012 |quote=''Both of the rocket's stages would return to the launch site and touch down vertically, under rocket power, on landing gear after delivering a spacecraft to orbit.

For example, on 2014-03-11, this search:  http://www.washingtonpost.com/newssearch/search.html?st=%22SpaceX+chief+details+reusable+rocket%22&submit=Submit+Query yielded a page that shows the existence and date of the article, but unfortunately does not provide a working link to get to that location.  Since WP:DEADLINK suggests that a deadlink alone is no reason for a citation to be removed, and especially since in this case there was a quotation provided by the editor who originally added the source, the correct thing seems to be to note it, and move on.
