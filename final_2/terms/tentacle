In animal anatomy, tentacles usually occur in one or more pairs. Anatomically, the tentacles of animals work mainly like [[muscular hydrostat]]s. Most forms of tentacles are used for grasping and feeding. Many are [[Sensory system|sensory organ]]s, variously receptive to [[somatosensory system|touch]], [[visual perception|vision]], or to the [[Chemoreceptor|smell or taste]] of particular foods or threats. Examples of such tentacles are the \"eye stalks\" of various kinds of [[snail]]s. Some kinds of tentacles have both sensory and manipulatory functions.\n\nThe word '''tentillum''' literally means \"little tentacle\". However, irrespective of size, it usually refers to a side branch of a larger tentacle. In some cases such tentilla are specialised for particular functions; for example, in the [[Cnidaria]] tentilla usually bear [[cnidocyte]]s,<ref>[http://species-identification.org/species.php?species_group=zsao&selected=definitie&menuentry=woordenlijst&record=tentilla Marine Species Identification Portal : Zooplankton of the South Atlantic Ocean : Glossary : tentilla]. Species-identification.org. Retrieved on 2013-05-02.</ref> whereas in the [[Ctenophora]] they usually bear [[collocyte]]s.<ref name=\"CNH1\">Harmer, Sir Sidney Frederic; Shipley, Arthur Everett et al.

The most familiar are those of the [[Pulmonata|pulmonate land snails]], which usually have two sets of tentacles on the head: when extended the upper pair have eyes at their tips; the lower pair are [[chemoreceptor]]s. Both pairs are fully retractable [[muscular hydrostat]]s, but they are not used for manipulation or prey capture.\n\nSome marine snails such as [[abalone]] and top snails, [[Trochidae]], have numerous small tentacles around the edge of the [[mantle (mollusc)|mantle]]. These are known as ''pallial tentacles''.<ref name=bou/>\n\n[[Cephalopod]]s such as octopuses and squids have the most spectacular tentacles. They take the form of highly mobile muscular hydrostats with various appendages such as suction disks and sometimes thorny hooks. Up to the early twentieth century they were interchangeably called \"arms\" or \"tentacles\".<ref name= \"CNH3\">Cooke, A. H.; Shipley, Arthur Everett et alia: The Cambridge natural history Volume 34, Molluscs, Trilobites, Brachiopods  etc. Macmillan Company 1895</ref> The modern convention however, is to speak of appendages as \"tentacles\" when they have relatively thin \"[[peduncle (anatomy)|peduncles]]\" or \"stalks\" with \"clubs\" at their tips. In contrast the convention refers to the relatively shorter appendages as \"arms\". By this definition the eight appendages of octopuses, though quite long, count as arms. In terms of this article however, both types of organs count as tentacles because in relevant ways they are structurally and functionally similar.<ref name=bou>{{cite web| author= Boumis R | title= Animals With Tentacles |url= http://animals.pawnation.com/animals-tentacles-2495.html |year= 2013|work= Pawnation |publisher= AOL Inc. |accessdate=2013-06-08}}</ref>\n\nThe tentacles of the [[giant squid]] and [[colossal squid]] have powerful suckers and pointed teeth at the ends. The teeth of the giant squid resemble [[crown cork|bottle caps]], and function like tiny, [[hole saw]]s; while the tentacles of the colossal squid wield two long rows of swiveling, tri-pointed hooks.\n\n===Cnidarians===\n[[Cnidarian]]s, such as [[jellyfish]], [[sea anemone]]s, ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and [[coral]] have numerous hair-like tentacles. Cnidarians have huge numbers of [[cnidocyte]]s on their tentacles. In [[jellyfish|medusoid form]], the body floats on water so that the tentacles hang down in a ring around the mouth. In [[polyp]] form, such as sea anemone and coral, the body is below with the tentacles pointed upwards.\nMany species of the jellyfish-like [[ctenophore]]s have two tentacles, while some have none. Their tentacles have adhesive structures called ''[[colloblast]]s'' or ''lasso cells''. The colloblasts burst open when prey comes in contact with the tentacle, releasing sticky threads that secure the food.<ref>{{cite web| author= Bird J | title= CNIDARIANS: SIMPLE ANIMALS WITH A STING! |url= http://www.oceanicresearch.org/education/wonders/cnidarian.html|date= 5 June 2007|work= oceanicresearch.org |publisher= Oceanic Research Group |accessdate=2013-06-08}}</ref>\n\nThe tentacles of the [[Lion's mane jellyfish]] may be up to 120 feet (37 meters) long.

The current opinion is that these tentacles supplement the normal sense of smell, possibly for navigation and to locate prey underground.<ref name=bou/>\n\n==Mammals==\nThe [[star-nosed mole]], ''Condylura cristata'', of [[North America]], has 22 short but conspicuous tentacles around its nose. They are mobile and extremely sensitive, helping the animal to find its way about the burrow and detect prey. They are about 1\u20134&nbsp;mm long and hold about 25,000 [[Somatosensory system|touch receptors]] called [[Eimer's organ]]s, perhaps giving this mole the most delicate sense of touch among mammals.<ref name=bou/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat-inline|Tentacles}}\n*[http://animals.about.com/od/t/g/tentacle.htm Tentacle- About.com]\n*[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/587589/tentacle Enclopaedia Britannica]\n\n[[Category:Animal anatomy]]\n[[Category:Animal morphology]]"}]}}}}
