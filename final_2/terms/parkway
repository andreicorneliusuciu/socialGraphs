Merriam-Webster, 2002. http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com (14 Apr. 2007).</ref> The term is particularly used for a roadway in a [[park]] or connecting to a park from which trucks and other [[heavy vehicle]]s are excluded.<ref name=\"Parkway\"/> Many parkways originally intended for scenic, recreational driving have evolved into major urban and commuter routes.\n\nThe term ''parkway'' is sometimes applied more generally to a variety of [[limited-access road]]s.\n\n==United States==\n[[File:Eastern Pkwy west of New York Ave.JPG|thumb|right|[[Brooklyn]]'s [[Eastern Parkway (Brooklyn)|Eastern Parkway]], the world's first parkway, according to the [[New York City]] [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation|Department of Parks and Recreation]].]]\n[[File:IMG 2237 - Clara Barton Pkwy at NSWC (looking west).JPG|thumb|right|The [[Clara Barton Parkway]] in [[Maryland]]]]\n\n===Scenic roads===\nOver the years, many different types of roads have been labeled parkways.\n\nThe first parkways in the [[United States]] were developed during the late 19th century by landscape architects [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Beatrix Farrand]] as roads segregated for pedestrians, bicyclists, equestrians, and [[horse carriage]]s, such as the [[Eastern Parkway]], which is credited as the world's first parkway,<ref>http://www.nycgovparks.org/about/history/historical-signs/listings?id=196</ref> and [[Ocean Parkway (Brooklyn)|Ocean Parkway]] in the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Brooklyn]].  The terminology \"parkway\" to define this type of road was coined by [[Calvert Vaux]] and Frederick Law Olmsted in their proposal to link city and suburban parks with \"pleasure roads.\"\n\nNewer roads such as [[Delaware Park-Front Park System|Bidwell]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] and Park Presidio Boulevard in [[San Francisco, California]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Alexander|first1=Jeanne|title=History of Park Presidio Boulevard|website=ppnsf.org/history}}</ref> were designed for automobiles and are broad and divided by large landscaped central medians. \n\nDuring the early 20th century, the meaning of the word was expanded to include [[limited-access highway]]s designed for recreational driving of automobiles, with [[landscape|landscaping]]. These parkways originally provided [[scenic route]]s without very slow or [[commercial vehicle]]s, at [[Level crossing|grade intersections]], or pedestrian traffic such as the [[Merritt Parkway]] in Connecticut and the [[Vanderbilt Motor Parkway]] in New York. Their success led to more development however, expanding a city's boundaries, eventually limiting their recreational driving use. The [[Arroyo Seco Parkway]] between [[Downtown Los Angeles]] and [[Pasadena, California]] is an example of lost [[pastoral]] aesthetics. It and others have become major commuting routes, while retaining the name parkway.\n\n===Early high speed roads===\n{{See also|Parkways in New York State}}\nIn New York City, construction on the [[Long Island Motor Parkway]] (Vanderbilt Parkway) began in 1906 and planning for the [[Bronx River Parkway]] in 1907. In the 1920s, the  [[New York City Metropolitan Area]]'s parkway system grew under the direction of [[Robert Moses]], the president of the New York State Council of Parks and [[Long Island State Park Commission]], who used parkways to create and access state parks, especially for city dwellers. As Commissioner of New York City Parks under Mayor LaGuardia, he extended the parkways to the heart of the city, creating and linking its parks to the greater metropolitan systems.\n\nMost of the New York metropolitan parkways were designed by Gilmore Clark. The famed \"Gateway to New England\" [[Merritt Parkway]] in [[Connecticut]] was designed in the 1930s as a pleasurable alternative for affluent locals to the congested Boston Post Road, running through forest with each bridge designed uniquely to enhance the scenery. Another example is the [[Sprain Brook Parkway]] from [[The Bronx]] to become the [[Taconic State Parkway]] to [[Chatham, New York]]. [[Landscape architect]] [[George Kessler]] designed extensive parkway systems for [[Kansas City, Missouri#Parks and boulevard system|Kansas City, Missouri]]; [[Memphis Park and Parkway System|Memphis, Tennessee]]; [[Indianapolis Park and Boulevard System|Indianapolis]]; and other cities at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\n[[File:Natchez-Trace-Parkway-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|right|right|The [[Natchez Trace Parkway]]]]\n\n===New Deal roads===\nIn the 1930s, as part of the [[New Deal]] the U.S. federal government constructed [[National Parkway]]s designed for recreational driving and to commemorate historic trails and routes. These divided four-lane parkways have lower [[speed limit]]s and are maintained by the [[National Park Service]]. An example is the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) built [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of [[North Carolina]] and [[Virginia]].\n\nOthers are: [[Skyline Drive]] in [[Virginia]]; the [[Natchez Trace Parkway]] in [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], and [[Tennessee]]; and the [[Colonial Parkway]] in eastern Virginia's [[Historic Triangle]] area.  [http://www.roanoke.com/roatimes/special_sections/parkway/parkway1.html].  The [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] and the [[Clara Barton Parkway]], running along the [[Potomac River]] near [[Washington, D.C.]], were also constructed during this era.\n\n===Post-war parkways===\nIn [[Kentucky]] the term \"parkway\" designates a [[controlled-access highway]] in the [[:Category:Kentucky parkway system|Kentucky Parkway system]], with nine built in the 1960s and 1970s. They were [[toll road]]s until the [[construction bond]]s were repaid, now being [[freeway]]s since 2006.\n\nThe [[Arroyo Seco Parkway]] from [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] to [[Los Angeles]], built in 1940, was the first segment of the vast [[Southern California]] freeway system. It became part of [[Interstate 110 and State Route 110 (California)|State Route 110]] and was renamed the Pasadena Freeway. A 2010 restoration of the freeway brought the Arroyo Seco Parkway designation back.\n\n[[File:Truckersuseexpwysnotpkwys.jpg|thumb|right|right|Sign informing truckers it is illegal to use a parkway in [[New York City]].]]In the [[New York metropolitan area]], contemporary parkways are predominantly controlled-access highways restricted to non-commercial traffic, excluding [[truck]]s and [[tractor-trailer]]s. Some have low overpasses that also exclude buses. The Vanderbilt Parkway, an exception in western [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], is a surviving remnant of the [[Long Island Motor Parkway]] that became a [[surface street]], no longer with controlled-access or non-commercial vehicle restrictions. The [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]] is a post-war parkway that starts at the [[George Washington Bridge]], heads north through New Jersey, continuing through Rockland and Orange counties in New York. The Palisades Parkway was built to allow for a direct route from New York City to [[Harriman State Park (New York)|Harriman State Park]].\n\nIn [[New Jersey]], the [[Garden State Parkway]], connecting the urban Northeast U.S. with the rural [[Atlantic Ocean]] [[Jersey Shore|shoreline]] and [[Atlantic City]], is restricted to buses and non-commercial traffic north of the [[New Jersey Route 18|Route 18]] interchange but is one of the busiest [[toll road]]s in the country.<ref name=njdottrucks>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/about/rules/pdf/chapter32truckaccess.pdf|title=TITLE 16.

The Parkway East \u2014 [[Interstate 376|I-376]], formally the [[Penn-Lincoln Parkway]], connects Downtown Pittsburgh to [[Monroeville, Pennsylvania]].  The Parkway West \u2014 [[Interstate 376|I-376]] runs through the [[Fort Pitt Tunnel]] and links Downtown to [[Pittsburgh International Airport]], Southbound [[Interstate 79|I-79]], [[Imperial, Pennsylvania]], and Westbound US 22/30.  The Parkway North \u2014 [[Interstate 279|I-279]] connects Downtown to [[Franklin Park, Pennsylvania]] and Northbound [[Interstate 79|I-79]].\n<!---personal view & opinions, & missing NPOV---Many opponents of increased road construction in the [[United States]]{{Who|date=December 2008}} claim that the use of the term \"parkway\" in any sense other than as a scenic route through parkland, is deceptive.  It is claimed by such advocates{{Who|date=December 2008}} that many existing and proposed parkways (such as the proposed [[West Eugene Parkway]] in [[Oregon]]) are functionally indistinguishable from [[freeway]]s and/or [[Limited-access road|expressways]], and the \"parkway\" label is used to make construction of such routes seem more palatable to the public{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} (who might otherwise stage a [[Freeway revolts|freeway revolt]], especially if their neighborhood is affected).  Others{{Who|date=December 2008}} claim that this is splitting hairs; and that the use of the term \"parkway\" in conjunction with urban and suburban highways is a well-established practice.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  Furthermore, most routes{{where}} designated with the \"parkway\" label do have scenic enhancements (making the route more attractive for both motorists and neighbors),{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} and many such routes do exclude trucks. As truck traffic interferes with normal vehicle movement the congestion in the road can be reduced.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}--->\n\nIn [[Minneapolis]], the [[Grand Rounds Scenic Byway]] system has {{convert|50|mi|km}} of streets designated as parkways.  These are not freeways, having a slow 25-mile per hour speed limit, pedestrian crossings, and stop signs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minneapolisparks.org/grandrounds/inf_about.htm\n|title=Information Center: About the Grand Rounds|accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://secondward.blogspot.com/2007/01/traffic-calming-event.html|title=Second Ward, Minneapolis: Traffic Calming Event|accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Cincinnati]], parkways are major roads which trucks are prohibited from using.  Some Cincinnati parkways, such as Columbia Parkway, are high-speed, limited access roads, while others, such as Central Parkway, are multi-lane urban roads without controlled access.  Columbia Parkway carries US-50 traffic from downtown towards east-side suburbs of Mariemont, Anderson, and Milford, and is a limited access road from downtown to the Village of Mariemont.\n\n==Canada==\n[[File:Icefields Parkway-02.jpg|thumb|right|right|The [[Icefields Parkway]] runs through the [[Canadian Rockies]] in [[Jasper National Park]] and [[Banff National Park]].]]\n\n\"Parkway\" is used in the names of many [[Canada|Canadian]] roads, including major routes through [[National parks of Canada|national parks]], scenic drives, major urban thoroughfares, and even regular freeways that carry commercial traffic.\n\nParkways in the [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]] are administered by the [[National Capital Commission|National Capital Region (Canada)]]. However, some of them are named \"Drive\" or \"Driveway\".\n\nThe term in Canada is also applied to multi-use paths and [[Greenway (landscape)|greenways]] used by walkers and cyclists.<ref>[http://www.translink.ca/en/Getting-Around/Cycling/BC-Parkway.aspx BC Parkway, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada]</ref><ref>[http://www.stcatharines.ca/en/playin/WellandCanalsParkwayTrail.asp Welland Canals Parkway Trail, Canada]</ref>\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n!\n!\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n* [[Airport Parkway (Ottawa)]]\n* [[Aviation Parkway (Ottawa)]]\n* [[Colonel By Drive]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]]\n* [[Conestoga Parkway]] in [[Kitchener, Ontario]]\n* [[Don Valley Parkway]] in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]]\n* [[Emil Kolb Parkway]] in  [[Bolton, Ontario]]\n* [[Erin Mills Parkway]] in [[Mississauga, Ontario]]\n* [[Forest Hills Parkway]] in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]\n* [[Hanlon Parkway|Hanlon Expressway]] in [[Guelph, Ontario]]\n* [[Icefields Parkway]] in [[Alberta]]\n* [[Lauzon Parkway]] in [[Windsor, Ontario]]\n* [[Lincoln M.
