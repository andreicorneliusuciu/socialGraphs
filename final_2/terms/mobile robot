Mobile robots can be \"autonomous\" (AMR - autonomous mobile robot) which means they are capable of navigating an uncontrolled environment without the need for physical or electro-mechanical guidance devices.  Alternatively, mobile robots can rely on guidance devices that allow them to travel a pre-defined navigation route in relatively controlled space (AGV - autonomous guided vehicle).  By contrast, [[industrial robots]] are usually more-or-less stationary, consisting of a [[jointed arm]] (multi-linked manipulator) and [[Robot end effector|gripper]] assembly (or [[Robot end effector|end effector]]), attached to a fixed surface.\n\nMobile robots have become more commonplace in commercial and industrial settings.  Hospitals have been using autonomous mobile robots to move materials for many years.  Warehouses have installed mobile robotic systems to efficiently move materials from stocking shelves to order fulfillment zones. Mobile robots are also a major focus of current research and almost every major university has one or more labs that focus on mobile robot research.<ref>P. Moubarak, P. Ben-Tzvi, Adaptive Manipulation of a Hybrid Mechanism Mobile Robot, IEEE International Symposium on Robotic and Sensors Environments (ROSE), Montreal, Canada, 2011, pp. 113 - 118</ref> Mobile robots are also found in industrial, [[Military robot|military]] and security settings. [[Domestic robot]]s are consumer products, including [[entertainment robot]]s and those that perform certain household tasks such as [[Robotic vacuum cleaner|vacuuming]] or gardening.\n\nThe components of a mobile robot are a controller, control software, sensors and actuators. The controller is generally a microprocessor, embedded microcontroller or a personal computer (PC). Mobile control software can be either assembly level language or high-level languages such as C, C++, Pascal, Fortran or special real-time software. The sensors used are dependent upon the requirements of the robot. The requirements could be dead reckoning, tactile and proximity sensing, triangulation ranging, collision avoidance, position location and other specific applications.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gopalakrishnan|first1=B.|last2=Tirunellayi|first2=S.|last3=Todkar|first3=R.|title=Design and development of an autonomous mobile smart vehicle: a mechatronics application|journal=Mechatronics|date=2014|volume=14|pages=491\u2013514}}</ref>\n\n== Classification ==\nMobile robots may be classified by:\n\n* The environment in which they travel:\n** Land or home robots are usually referred to as [[Unmanned Ground Vehicles]] (UGVs). They are most commonly wheeled or tracked, but also include [[legged robot]]s with two or more legs ([[Humanoid robot|humanoid]], or resembling animals or insects).\n** Delivery & Transportation robots can move materials and supplies through a work environment\n** Aerial robots are usually referred to as [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicles]] (UAVs)\n** Underwater robots are usually called [[Autonomous Underwater Vehicle|autonomous underwater vehicles]] (AUVs)\n**Polar robots, designed to navigate icy, [[crevasse]] filled environments\n* The device they use to move, mainly:\n** [[Legged robot]] : [[human leg|human-like leg]]s (i.e.  an [[Android (robot)|android]]) or animal-like [[leg]]s.\n** [[Wheel]]ed robot.\n** [[Caterpillar track|Tracks]].<ref>[http://prweb.com/releases/Rail/Robot/prweb453019.htm Rail track] and [http://www.labautomationrobots.com/images/crstrack.pdf Linear track (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715130104/http://prweb.com/releases/Rail/Robot/prweb453019.htm |date=July 15, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n== Mobile robot navigation ==\n\nThere are many types of [[mobile robot navigation]]:\n\n=== Manual remote or tele-op ===\nA manually [[Teleoperation|teleoperated]] robot is totally under control of a driver with a joystick or other control device. The device may be plugged directly into the robot, may be a wireless joystick, or may be an accessory to a wireless computer or other controller. A tele-op'd robot is typically used to keep the operator out of harm's way. Examples of manual remote robots include [[Robotics Design|Robotics Design's]] ANATROLLER ARI-100 and ARI-50, Foster-Miller's Talon, [[Irobot|iRobot's]] PackBot, and KumoTek's MK-705 Roosterbot.\n\n=== Guarded tele-op ===\nA guarded tele-op robot has the ability to sense and avoid obstacles but will otherwise navigate as driven, like a robot under manual tele-op. Few if any mobile robots offer only guarded tele-op. ''(See Sliding Autonomy below.)''\n\n=== Line-following Car ===\nSome of the earliest Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) were line following mobile robots. They might follow a visual line painted or embedded in the floor or ceiling or an electrical wire in the floor. Most of these robots operated a simple \"keep the line in the center sensor\" algorithm. They could not circumnavigate obstacles; they just stopped and waited when something blocked their path. Many examples of such vehicles are still sold, by [[Transbotics]], FMC, Egemin, HK Systems and many other companies. These types of robots are still widely popular in well known Robotic societies as a first step towards learning nooks and corners of robotics.\n\n=== Autonomously randomized robot ===\nAutonomous robots with random motion basically bounce off walls, whether those walls are sensed\n\n=== Autonomously guided robot ===\n[[Image:smMT400 autonomous robot base with Motivity.jpg|thumb|right|Robot developers use ready-made autonomous bases and software to design robot applications quickly. Shells shaped like people or cartoon characters may cover the base to disguise it.<ref>[http://mobilerobots.com/MT400_autonomous_robotic_base.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223091932/http://mobilerobots.com/MT400_autonomous_robotic_base.html |date=February 23, 2010 }}</ref> ''Courtesy of MobileRobots Inc'']]\nAn autonomously guided robot knows at least some information about where it is and how to reach various goals and or waypoints along the way. \"Localization\" or knowledge of its current location, is calculated by one or more means, using sensors such motor encoders, vision, [[Stereopsis]], lasers and global positioning systems. Positioning systems often use triangulation, relative position and/or Monte-Carlo/Markov localization to determine the location and orientation of the platform, from which it can plan a path to its next waypoint or goal. It can gather sensor readings that are time- and location-stamped. Such robots are often part of the wireless enterprise network, interfaced with other sensing and control systems in the building. For instance, the [[PatrolBot]] security robot responds to alarms, operates elevators and notifies the command center when an incident arises. Other autonomously guided robots include the SpeciMinder and the TUG delivery robots for the hospital. In 2013, autonomous robots capable of finding sunlight and water for potted plants were created by artist [[Elizabeth Demaray]] in collaboration with engineer Dr. Qingze Zou, biologist Dr. Simeon Kotchomi, and computer scientist Dr. Ahmed Elgammal.<ref>{{cite news|last=WOOLLASTON|first=VICTORIA|title=Plant bot: The world's first robot that can turn your household plants into light-seeking 'triffid' drones|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2321914/Plant-bot-worlds-robot-turns-household-plants-light-seeking-drones.html|accessdate=9 January 2014|newspaper=Dailymail.co.uk|date=9 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Sliding autonomy ===\nMore capable robots combine multiple levels of navigation under a system called sliding autonomy. Most autonomously guided robots, such as the HelpMate hospital robot, also offer a manual mode. The Motivity autonomous robot operating system, which is used in the ADAM, PatrolBot, SpeciMinder, MapperBot and a number of other robots, offers full sliding autonomy, from manual to guarded to autonomous modes. {{Main article|Robotic mapping}} Also see [[Autonomous robot]]\n\n==History==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:7%\" |Date || Developments\n|-\n| 1939\u20131945 || During [[World War II]] the first mobile robots emerged as a result of technical advances on a number of relatively new research fields like [[computer science]] and [[cybernetics]]. They were mostly flying bombs. Examples are smart bombs that only detonate within a certain range of the target, the use of guiding systems and radar control. The [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] and [[V-2 rocket|V2]] rockets had a crude 'autopilot' and automatic detonation systems. They were the predecessors of modern [[cruise missile]]s.\n|-\n| 1948\u20131949 || [[William Grey Walter|W. Grey Walter]] builds [[Elmer (robot)|Elmer]] and [[Elsie (robot)|Elsie]], two autonomous robots called [[Machina Speculatrix]] because these robots liked to explore their environment. Elmer and Elsie were each equipped with a light sensor. If they found a light source they would move towards it, avoiding or moving obstacles on their way. These [[robot]]s demonstrated that complex behaviour could arise from a simple design. Elmer and Elsie only had the equivalent of two nerve cells.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ias.uwe.ac.uk/Robots/gwonline/gwonline.html |title=ias-people |publisher=Ias.uwe.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref>\n|-\n| 1961\u20131963 || The Johns Hopkins University develops '[[Johns Hopkins Beast|Beast]]'.
