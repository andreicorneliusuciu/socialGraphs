This form of propulsion differs from a conventional chemical [[rocket]] where both energy and reaction mass come from the solid or liquid [[propellant]]s carried on board the vehicle.\n[[File:Laser launch hx kare.png|thumb|300px|A laser launch Heat Exchanger Thruster system]]\n\n==History==\n\nThe basic concepts underlying a photon-propelled \"sail\" propulsion system were developed by [[Eugene Sanger]] and the Hungarian physicist [[George Marx]].  Propulsion concepts using laser-energized rockets were developed by [[Arthur Kantrowitz]] and Wolfgang Moekel in the 1970s.<ref>[http://researchspace.csir.co.za/dspace/bitstream/10204/1014/1/Michaelis1_2006.pdf Michaelis, MM and Forbes, A. 2006. Laser propulsion: a review. ''South African Journal of Science'', '''102'''(7/8), 289-295 ]</ref>  An exposition of Kantrowitz's laser propulsion ideas were published in 1988.<ref>A. Kantrowitz, in  [[International Conference of Laser Applications|''Proceedings of the International Conference on Lasers '87'']], [[F. J. Duarte]], Ed. (STS Press, Mc Lean, VA, 1988).</ref>\n\nLaser propulsion systems may transfer [[momentum]] to a spacecraft in two different ways. The first way uses [[photon]] [[radiation pressure]] to drive momentum transfer and is the principle behind [[solar sail]]s and laser sails. The second method uses the laser to help expel mass from the spacecraft as in a conventional rocket. This is the more frequently proposed method, but is fundamentally limited in final spacecraft velocities by the [[rocket equation]].\n\n==Laser Pushed Sails==\nLaser-pushed sails are examples of [[beam-powered propulsion]].\n\n===Laser Pushed Lightsail===\nA laser-pushed lightsail is a thin reflective sail similar to a [[solar sail]], in which the sail is by being pushed by a laser, rather than the sun.  The advantage of lightsail propulsion is that the vehicle does not carry either the energy source or the reaction mass for propulsion, and hence the limitations of the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]] to achieving high velocities are avoided. Use of a laser-pushed lightsail was proposed initially by Marx in 1966,<ref>G. Marx, \"Interstellar Vehicle Propelled by Laser Beam,\" ''Nature, Vol. 211'', July 1966, pp. 22-23.</ref>  as a method of [[Interstellar travel]] that would avoid extremely high [[mass ratio]]s by not carrying fuel, and analyzed in detail by physicist [[Robert L. Forward]] in 1989.<ref>R. L. Forward, \"Roundtrip Interstellar Travel Using Laser-Pushed lightsails,\" ''J. Spacecraft and Rockets, Vol. 21'', pp 187-195 (Mar-Apr. 1989)</ref>    Further analysis of the concept was done by [[Geoffrey A. Landis|Landis]],<ref>G. A. Landis, \"Optics and Materials Considerations for a Laser-Propelled Lightsail\", paper IAA-89-664 ([http://www.sff.net/people/Geoffrey.Landis/lightsail/Lightsail89.html text]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})</ref><ref>G.

G. Andrews, \"Cost Considerations for Interstellar Missions,\" paper IAA-93-706</ref> and others.\n\nThe beam has to have a large diameter so that only a small portion of the beam misses the sail due to [[diffraction]] and the laser or microwave antenna has to have a good pointing stability so that the craft can tilt its sails fast enough to follow the center of the beam. This gets more important when going from [[interplanetary travel]] to [[interstellar travel]], and when going from a fly-by mission, to a landing mission, to a return mission. The laser may alternatively be a large [[phased array]] of small devices, which get their energy directly from solar radiation.\n\nThe laser-pushed sail is proposed as a method of propelling a small interstellar probe by the [[Breakthrough Starshot]] project.\n\n===Laser Pushed Lightsail with photon recycling===\nMetzgar and Landis proposed a variant on the laser-pushed sail, in which the photons reflected from the sail are re-used by re-reflecting them back to the sail by a stationary mirror; a \"multi-bounce laser-based sail.\"<ref>R. A. Metzger and G. A. Landis, \"Multi-Bounce Laser-Based Sails,\" ''STAIF Conference on Space Exploration Technology'', Albuquerque NM, Feb. 11-15, 2001. ''AIP Conf.

A. Metzger and G. A. Landis, \"Multi-Bounce Laser-Based Sails,\" ''STAIF Conference on Space Exploration Technology'', Albuquerque NM, Feb. 11-15, 2001. ''AIP Conf.

The use of a laser as the energy source means that the energy provided to the propellant is not limited by the chemical energy of the propellant.\n\n===Laser Thermal Rocket (Heat exchanger (HX) thruster)===\n\nThe laser thermal rocket is a [[thermal rocket]] in which the propellant is heated by energy provided by an external laser beam.<ref>H. Krier and R. J. Glumb.

This is similar in principle to [[nuclear thermal rocket|nuclear thermal]] and [[solar thermal rocket|solar thermal]] propulsion. Using a large flat heat exchanger allows the laser beam to shine directly on the heat exchanger without focusing optics on the vehicle. The HX thruster has the advantage of working equally well with any laser wavelength and both CW and pulsed lasers, and of having an efficiency approaching 100%. The HX thruster is limited by the heat exchanger material and by radiative losses to relatively low gas temperatures, typically 1000 - 2000 C. For a given temperature, the specific impulse is maximized with the minimum molecular weight reaction mass, and with hydrogen propellant, that provides sufficient specific impulse as high as 600 \u2013 800 seconds, high enough in principle to allow single stage vehicles to reach low Earth orbit. The HX laser thruster concept was developed by [[Jordin Kare]] in 1991;<ref>[http://www.jkare.com/VG_HX_4-29-SAS.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724205642/http://www.jkare.com/VG_HX_4-29-SAS.pdf |date=July 24, 2011 }}</ref> a similar microwave thermal propulsion concept was developed independently by [[Kevin L. Parkin]] at [[Caltech]] in 2001.\n\nA variation on this concept was proposed by Prof. John Sinko and Dr. Clifford Schlecht as a redundant safety concept for assets on orbit.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21228346.100-laser-tractor-beams-could-reel-in-lost-astronauts.html Laser 'tractor beams' could reel in lost astronauts - tech - 17 October 2011 - New Scientist<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Packets of enclosed propellants are attached to the outside of a space suit, and exhaust channels run from each packet to the far side of the astronaut or tool. A laser beam from a space station or shuttle vaporizes the propellant inside the packs. Exhaust is directed behind the astronaut or tool, pulling the target towards the laser source. To brake the approach, a second wavelength is used to ablate the exterior of the propellant packets on the near side.\n\n===Ablative laser propulsion===\n\nAblative laser propulsion (ALP) is a form of [[beam-powered propulsion]] in which an external pulsed [[laser]] is used to burn off a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] plume from a solid metal [[propellant]], thus producing [[thrust]].<ref>[http://materials.web.psi.ch/Publications/Publ_MatDev_files/2010/Claude_AIP_2010.pdf Claude AIP 2010]</ref> The measured [[specific impulse]] of small ALP setups is very high at about 5000 s (49&nbsp;kN\u00b7s/kg), and unlike the [[lightcraft]] developed by [[Leik Myrabo]] which uses air as the propellant, ALP can be used in space.\n\nMaterial is directly removed from a solid or liquid surface at high velocities by [[laser ablation]] by a pulsed laser. Depending on the laser [[flux]] and pulse duration, the material can be simply heated and evaporated, or converted to [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Ablative propulsion will work in air or vacuum. [[Specific impulse]] values from 200 seconds to several thousand seconds are possible by choosing the propellant and laser pulse characteristics. Variations of ablative propulsion include double-pulse propulsion in which one laser pulse ablates material and a second laser pulse further heats the ablated gas, laser micropropulsion in which a small laser on board a spacecraft ablates very small amounts of propellant for altitude control or maneuvering, and [[space debris]] removal, in which the laser ablates material from debris particles in [[low Earth orbit]], changing their orbits and causing them to reenter.\n\n[[University of Alabama Huntsville]] Propulsion Research Center<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.uah.edu/prc |title= UAH Propulsion Research Center |accessdate= March 18, 2014}}</ref> has researched ALP.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://nsstc.uah.edu/essa/docs/iac/Bergstue-Grant-IAC-11.C4.8.2.x11495.pdf |title= Beamed Energy for Ablative Propusion in Near Earth Space |date= 2011 |accessdate = March 18, 2014 |author1= Grant Bergstue |author2= Richard L. Fork |publisher= [[International Astronautical Federation]]}}</ref>\n\n===Pulsed plasma propulsion===\n\nA high energy pulse focused in a gas or on a solid surface surrounded by gas produces breakdown of the gas (usually air). This causes an expanding shock wave which absorbs laser energy at the shock front (a laser sustained detonation wave or LSD wave); expansion of the hot plasma behind the shock front during and after the pulse transmits momentum to the craft. Pulsed plasma propulsion using air as the working fluid is the simplest form of air-breathing laser propulsion. The record-breaking [[Lightcraft]], developed by [[Leik Myrabo]] of RPI ([[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]) and Frank Mead, works on this principle.\n\nAnother concept of pulsed plasma propulsion is being investigated by Prof. Hideyuki Horisawa.<ref>[http://www.ea.u-tokai.ac.jp/horisawa/pg95.html]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===CW plasma propulsion===\n\nA continuous laser beam focused in a flowing stream of gas creates a stable laser sustained plasma which heats the gas; the hot gas is then expanded through a conventional nozzle to produce thrust. Because the plasma does not touch the walls of the engine, very high gas temperatures are possible, as in [[Gas core reactor rocket|gas core nuclear thermal]] propulsion. However, to achieve high [[specific impulse]], the propellant must have low molecular weight; [[hydrogen]] is usually assumed for actual use, at specific impulses around 1000 seconds. CW plasma propulsion has the disadvantage that the laser beam must be precisely focused into the absorption chamber, either through a window or by using a specially-shaped nozzle. CW plasma thruster experiments were performed in the 1970s and 1980s, primarily by Dr. Dennis Keefer of [[University of Tennessee Space Institute|UTSI]] and Prof. Herman Krier of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].\n\n===Laser electric propulsion===\nA general class of propulsion techniques in which the laser beam power is converted to electricity, which then powers some type of [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] thruster.\n\nA small [[quadcopter]] has flown for 12 hours and 26 minutes charged by a 2.25&nbsp;kW laser (powered at less than half of its normal operating current), using 170 watt [[photovoltaic array]]s as the power receiver,<ref>[[Jordin Kare|Kare]] / [[Tom Nugent (physicist)|Nugent]] et al.

However, [[Leik Myrabo]] has proposed high-thrust laser electric propulsion, using [[magnetohydrodynamics]] to convert laser energy to electricity and to electrically accelerate air around a vehicle for thrust.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Beam-powered propulsion]]\n*[[Elevator:2010]]\n*[[Jordin Kare]]\n*[[Leik Myrabo]]\n*[[List of laser articles]]\n*[[Optical lift]]\n*[[Rocket engine]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Laser propulsion}}\n*{{YouTube|kBHQcArA1fM|title=NASA video on Laser Drive Propulsion}} \n* [http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19910008838 Investigations Into a Potential Laser-NASP Transport Technology].
