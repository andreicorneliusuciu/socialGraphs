Typically, it takes the form of a spacecraft equipped with [[wing]]s, although [[lifting body|lifting bodies]] have been designed and tested as well. The propulsion to reach space may be purely rocket based or may use the assistance of [[airbreathing jet engine]]s. The spaceflight is then followed by an unpowered [[glider (aircraft)|glide]] return to landing.\n\nFive spaceplanes have successfully flown to date, having [[Atmospheric entry|reentered Earth's atmosphere]], [[Descent (aeronautics)|returned]] to [[Earth]], and [[Landing#Aircraft|safely landed]] \u2014 the [[North American X-15]], [[Space Shuttle]], [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]], [[SpaceShipOne]], and [[Boeing X-37]].  All five are considered rocket gliders. {{As of|2015}}, only these aircraft and [[rocket]]s have succeeded in reaching [[outer space|space]].  Two of these five (X-15 and SpaceShipOne) are [[rocket-powered aircraft]], having been carried up to an altitude of several tens of thousands of feet by an atmospheric [[mother ship]] before being released, and then flying beyond the [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line|boundaries of the earth's atmosphere]] under their own power.  Three (Space Shuttle, Buran, and X-37) are [[VTHL|vertical takeoff horizontal landing]] (VTHL) vehicles relying upon [[Launch vehicle|rocket lift]] for the ascent phase in reaching space and [[Lift (force)|atmospheric lift]] for [[Atmospheric entry|reentry]], [[Descent (aircraft)|descent]] and [[Landing#Aircraft|landing]]. The three VTHL spaceplanes flew much further than the aircraft launched ones, not merely leaving the earth's atmosphere but also entering orbit around it, which requires at least 50 times more energy on the way up and heavy heat shielding for the trip back.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://archive.wired.com/science/space/magazine/15-06/ff_space_musk?currentPage=all |title=Betting on a Mission Beyond Earth's Orbit |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |first=Carl |last=Hoffman |issue=15.06 |date=22 May 2007 |accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref> Of the five vehicles, three have been piloted by astronauts, with the Buran and X-37 flying unmanned missions.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Atlantis is landing after STS-30 mission.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Landing of [[NASA]]'s {{OV|Atlantis}}. The American Space Shuttle orbiters were manned orbital spaceplanes.]]\nSignificant features distinguish spaceplanes from [[spacecraft]].\n\n=== Aerodynamic lift ===\n{{Main|Lift (force)}}\n\nAll aircraft utilize [[wing|aerodynamic surface]]s in order to generate lift. For spaceplanes a variety of wing shapes can be used. Delta wings are common, but straight wings, [[lifting body|lifting bodies]] and even [[rotorcraft]] have been proposed. Typically the force of lift generated by these surfaces is many times that of the [[Drag (physics)|drag]] that they induce.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Atmospheric reentry ===\n{{main|Atmospheric entry}}\nBecause [[suborbital spaceplane]]s are designed for trajectories that do not reach [[orbital speed]], they do not need the kinds of thermal protection orbital spacecraft required during the [[hypersonic]] phase of [[atmospheric reentry]]. The [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system]], for example, protects the orbiter from surface temperatures that could otherwise reach as high as {{convert|3000|F|C|disp=flip}}, well above the melting point of steel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/nasafact/tps.htm |title=Orbiter Thermal Protection System |publisher=NASA/Kennedy Space Center |date=1989}}</ref>\n\n=== Aircraft landing ===\n{{main|Landing#Aircraft}}\nA spaceplane operates as an [[aircraft]] in [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]].  Aircraft may land on firm [[runway]]s, [[helicopter landing pad]]s, or even [[water]] ([[amphibious aircraft]]), [[snow]] or [[ice]].  To land, the airspeed and the rate of [[Descent (aircraft)|descent]] are reduced such that the aircraft descends at a slow enough rate to allow for a gentle touch down. Landing is accomplished by slowing down and descending. This speed reduction is accomplished by reducing thrust and/or inducing a greater amount of drag using flaps, [[landing gear]] or [[Air brake (aircraft)|speed brakes]].  [[Splashdown (spacecraft landing)|Splashdown]] is an easier technical feat to accomplish, requiring only the deployment of a [[parachute]] (or parachutes), rather than successfully [[History of aviation#Heavier than air|aviating]] the [[atmosphere]].{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|1977|pp=xvi-xvii, 145-148, 171-173}} Project Gemini's original concept design was as a spaceplane, with paraglider and wheels (or skis) attached.  However, this concept was abandoned in favor of parachute splashdowns, because of expensive technical failures during testing and development.  Whereas Project Gemini's splashdown parachutes took only 5 months to develop in 1963, Gemini's spaceplane concept failed to materialize even after nearly 3 years of continued development.\n\n=== Propulsion ===\n[[File:Buran rear view (Le Bourget 1989).JPEG|200px|thumb|right|Buran orbiter rear showing rocket engine nozzles, for maneuvering in low Earth orbit and thin air]]\n\n==== Rocket engines ====\n\nAll spaceplanes to date have used [[rocket engine]]s with chemical fuels.   As the [[orbital insertion]] burn has to be done in space, orbital spaceplanes require rocket engines for at least that portion of the flight.\n\n==== Airbreathing engines ====\n{{main|Airbreathing jet engine}}\n\nA difference between rocket based and air-breathing aerospace plane launch systems is that aerospace plane designs typically include minimal [[oxidizer]] storage for propulsion.  Air-breathing aerospace plane designs include engine inlets so they can use atmospheric oxygen for [[combustion]].  Since the mass of the oxidizer is, at takeoff, the single largest mass of most rocket designs (the [[Space Shuttle]]'s [[Space Shuttle external tank#Technical specifications|liquid oxygen tank]] weighs 629,340&nbsp;kg, more than one of its [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]]s), this provides a huge potential weight savings benefit. However, air breathing engines are usually very much heavier than rocket engines and the empty weight of the oxidizer tank, and since, unlike oxidizer, this extra weight (which is not expended to add kinetic energy to the vessel, as is propellant mass) must be carried into space it may offset the overall system performance.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nTypes of air breathing engines proposed for spaceplanes include [[scramjet]], [[liquid air cycle engine]]s, [[precooled jet engine]]s, [[pulse detonation engine]] and [[ramjet]]s. Some engine designs combine several types of engines features into a combined cycle. For instance, the [[Rocket-based combined cycle]] (RBCC) engine uses a rocket engine inside a ramscoop so that at low speed, the rockets thrust is boosted by ejector augmented thrust. It then transitions to ramjet propulsion at near-supersonic speeds, then to supersonic combustion or scramjet propulsion, above Mach 6, then back to pure rocket propulsion above Mach 10.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Harsh flight environment ===\nThe flight trajectory required of air-breathing aerospace vehicles to reach orbit is to fly what is known as a 'depressed trajectory' which places the aerospace plane in the high-altitude hypersonic flight regime of the atmosphere.  This environment induces high dynamic pressure, high temperature, and high heat flow loads particularly upon the [[leading edge]] surfaces of the aerospace plane.  These loads typically require special advanced materials, [[active cooling]], or both, for the structures to survive the environment.\n\nRocket-powered spaceplanes also face a significant thermal environment if they are burning for orbit, but this is nevertheless far less severe than air-breathing spaceplanes.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nSuborbital space planes designed to briefly reach space do not require significant thermal protection, as they experience peak heating for only a short time during re-entry. Intercontinental suborbital trajectories require much higher speeds and thermal protection more similar to orbital [[spacecraft reentry]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Center of mass issues ===\nA wingless launch vehicle has lower aerodynamic forces affecting the vehicle, and [[Flight dynamics|attitude control]] can be active perhaps with some fins to aid stability. For a winged vehicle the centre of lift moves during the atmospheric flight as well as the centre of mass; and the vehicle spends longer in the atmosphere as well. Historically, the [[X-33]] and [[HOTOL]] spaceplanes were rear engined and had relatively heavy engines. This puts a heavy mass at the rear of the aircraft with wings that had to hold up the vehicle. As the wet mass reduces, the centre of mass tends to move rearward behind the centre of lift, which tends to be around the centre of the wings. This can cause severe instability that is usually solved by extra fins which add weight and decrease performance.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n== Flown spaceplanes ==\n[[File:World's First Five Spaceplanes.PNG|thumb|500px|right|World's first spaceplanes: [[North American X-15]], [[Space Shuttle]], [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]], [[SpaceShipOne]], [[Boeing X-37]].

SpaceShipOne was piloted by the first [[commercial astronaut]]. Both X-15 and SpaceShipOne [[Rocket-powered aircraft|ascend horizontally]] from a [[mother ship]]. Both Buran and X-37 spaceflights were [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|unmanned]].

They include the piloted [[United States]] [[Space Shuttle]] and two unmanned spaceplanes:  the late-1980s [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Shuttle Buran|Buran]] and the early-2010s [[Boeing X-37]].\n\nThe early-1980s [[BOR-4]] (subscale test vehicle for the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-105|Spiral spaceplane]] that was subsequently cancelled) was a [[spacecraft]] that did successfully [[Atmospheric entry|reenter the atmosphere]] and fly like an [[aircraft]].  But it was not designed to [[History of aviation#Sustaining the aircraft|sustain atmospheric flight]].  It was designed to stop flying, open a [[parachute]] and then [[Splashdown (spacecraft landing)|splash in the ocean]].\n\nThese vehicles have used [[Airfoil|wings]] to provide [[aerobraking]] to return from orbit and to provide [[Lift (force)|lift]], allowing them to land on a [[runway]] like conventional aircraft. These vehicles are still designed to ascend to orbit vertically under [[rocket]] power like conventional [[expendable launch system|expendable launch vehicles]]. One drawback of spaceplanes is that they have a significantly smaller [[payload fraction]] than a ballistic design with the same takeoff weight. This is in part due to the weight of the wings \u2014 around 9-12% of the weight of the atmospheric flight weight of the vehicle. This significantly reduces the payload size, but the reusability is intended to offset this disadvantage.\n\nWhile all spaceplanes have used [[Lift (force)|atmospheric lift]] for the [[Atmospheric entry|reentry phase]], none to date have succeeded in a design that relies on aerodynamic lift for the ascent phase in reaching space (excluding a [[mother ship]] first stage). Efforts such as the [[Silbervogel]] and [[X-30]]/[[X-33]] have all failed to materialize into a vehicle capable of successfully reaching space. The [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus]] winged booster has had many successful flights to deploy orbital payloads, but since its aerodynamic vehicle component operates only as a booster, and not operate in space as a spacecraft, it is not typically considered to be a spaceplane.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nOn the other hand, [[OREX]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocket.jaxa.jp/fstrc/0c01.html |title=OREX |publisher=Space Transportation System Research and Development Center, JAXA |accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> is a test vehicle of [[HOPE-X]] and launched into 450&nbsp;km LEO using [[H-II]] in 1994. OREX succeeded to reenter, but it was only hemispherical head of HOPE-X, that is, not plane-shaped.\n\n=== Suborbital spaceplanes ===\n[[File:X-15 flying.jpg|thumb|right|The X-15's rocket engine used ammonia and liquid oxygen.]]\n{{main|Suborbital spaceplane|Rocket-powered aircraft}}\nOther spaceplane designs are [[suborbital spaceplane|suborbital]], requiring far less energy for propulsion, and can use the vehicle's wings to provide lift for the ''ascent to'' space in addition to the rocket. As of 2010, the only such craft to have successfully flown to and from [[space]], back to [[earth]], have been the [[North American X-15]] and [[SpaceShipOne]]. Neither of these craft was capable of entering orbit. The X-15 and SpaceShipOne both began their independent flight only after being lifted to high altitude by a carrier aircraft.\n[[File:Flight 16P taxi pre launch photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|left|SpaceShipOne]]\n[[Scaled Composites]] and [[Virgin Galactic]] unveiled on 7 December 2009, the [[SpaceShipTwo]] space plane, the [[VSS Enterprise]], and its [[WhiteKnightTwo]] mothership, \"Eve\".

Notable early designs include [[Friedrich Zander]]'s spaceplane equipped with wings made of combustible alloys that it would burn during its ascent, and [[Eugen S\u00e4nger]]'s [[Silbervogel]] [[bomber aircraft|bomber]] design. Also in [[Nazi Germany]] and then in the USA, winged versions of the [[V-2]] rocket were considered during and after [[World War II]], and when public interest in space exploration was high in the 1950s and '60s, winged rocket designs by [[Wernher von Braun]] and [[Willy Ley]] served to inspire [[science fiction]] artists and filmmakers.\n\n=== United States ===\nThe [[U.S. Air Force]] invested some effort in a paper study of a variety of spaceplane projects under their [[Aerospaceplane]] efforts of the late 1950s, but later ended these when they decided to use a modified version of S\u00e4nger's design. The result, [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]], was to have been the first orbital spaceplane, but was canceled in the early 1960s in lieu of [[NASA]]'s [[Project Gemini]] and the U.S. Air Force's [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] program.\n\nIn 1961, NASA originally planned to have the [[Project Gemini#Spacecraft|Gemini spacecraft]] land on a firm, solid ground [[runway]]{{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|1977|pp=xvi-xvii}} with a [[Rogallo wing]] [[airfoil]], rather than as a [[Splashdown (spacecraft landing)|splashdown]] with [[parachute]].<ref name=\"Gem\">Please refer to [[Project Gemini#Spacecraft]].</ref>  The test vehicle became known as the [[NASA Paresev|Paraglider Research Vehicle]].
