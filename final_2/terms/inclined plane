A loop of string with beads at equal intervals is draped over the inclined planes, with part hanging down below.  The beads resting on the planes act as loads on the planes, held up by the tension force in the string at point ''T''.  Stevin's argument goes like this:<ref name=\"Koetsier\" /><ref name=\"Devreese\">{{cite book   \n  | last = Devreese\n  | first = Jozef T. \n  | authorlink = \n  |author2=Guido Vanden Berghe\n  | title = 'Magic is no magic': The wonderful world of Simon Stevin\n  | publisher = WIT Press\n  | year = 2008\n  | location = \n  | pages = 136\u2013139\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=f59h2ooQGmcC&pg=PA136\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 978-1-84564-391-1}}</ref><ref name=\"Feynman\">{{cite book   \n  | last = Feynman\n  | first = Richard P. \n  | authorlink = \n  |author2=Robert B.

If it was heavier on one side than the other, and began to slide right or left under its own weight, when each bead had moved to the position of the previous bead the string would be indistinguishable from its initial position and therefore would continue to be unbalanced and slide.  This argument could be repeated indefinitely, resulting in a circular [[perpetual motion]], which is absurd.  Therefore, it is stationary, with the forces on the two sides at point ''T'' (''above'') equal.\n*The portion of the chain hanging below the inclined planes is symmetrical, with an equal number of beads on each side. It exerts an equal force on each side of the string.  Therefore, this portion of the string can be cut off at the edges of the planes ''(points S and V)'', leaving only the beads resting on the inclined planes, and this remaining portion will still be in static equilibrium.\n*Since the beads are at equal intervals on the string, the total number of beads supported by each plane, the total load, is proportional to the length of the plane.  Since the input supporting force, the tension in the string, is the same for both, the mechanical advantage of each plane is proportional to its slant length\nAs pointed out by Dijksterhuis,<ref>E.J.Dijksterhuis: ''Simon Stevin'' 1943</ref> Stevin's argument is not completely tight. The forces exerted by the hanging part of the chain need not be symmetrical because the hanging part ''need not retain its shape'' when let go. Even if the chain is released with  a zero angular momentum, motion including oscillations is possible unless the chain is initially in its equilibrium configuration, a supposition which would make the argument circular. \n|}\n\nInclined planes have been used by people since prehistoric times to move heavy objects.<ref name=\"Conn\">Therese McGuire, ''Light on Sacred Stones'', in {{cite book   \n  | last = Conn\n  | first = Marie A. \n  | authorlink = \n  |author2=Therese Benedict McGuire\n  | title = Not etched in stone: essays on ritual memory, soul, and society\n  | publisher = University Press of America\n  | year = 2007\n  | location = \n  | pages = 23\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kEPkDyvek3sC&pg=PA23\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 978-0-7618-3702-2}}</ref><ref name=\"Dutch\">{{cite web\n  | last = Dutch\n  | first = Steven \n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Pre-Greek Accomplishments\n  | work = Legacy of the Ancient World\n  | publisher = [http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/    Prof. Steve Dutch's page, Univ. of Wisconsin at Green Bay]\n  | year = 1999\n  | url = http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/westtech/xancient.htm\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = March 13, 2012}}</ref>  The sloping roads and [[causeway]]s built by ancient civilizations such as the Romans are examples of early inclined planes that have survived, and show that they understood the value of this device for moving things uphill.

In the absence of applied force the load will slide down the plane, and requires some positive (uphill) force to hold it motionless\n\n==Mechanical advantage using power==\n[[Image:Free body.svg|right|thumb|Key: N = [[Normal force]] that is perpendicular to the plane, W=mg, where m = [[mass]], g = [[gravity]], and \u03b8 ([[theta]]) = Angle of inclination of the plane]]\nThe [[mechanical advantage]] of an inclined plane is the ratio of the weight of the load on the ramp to the force required to pull it up the ramp.  If energy is not dissipated or stored in the movement of the load, then this mechanical advantage can be computed from the dimensions of the ramp.\n\nIn order to show this, let the position '''r''' of a rail car on along the ramp with an angle, ''\u03b8'', above the horizontal be given by\n:<math>\\mathbf{r} = R (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta),</math>\n\nwhere ''R'' is the distance along the ramp.  The velocity of the car up the ramp is now\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{v} = V  (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta).</math>\n\nBecause there are no losses, the power used by force ''F'' to move the load up the ramp equals the power out, which is the vertical lift of the weight ''W'' of the load.\n\nThe input power pulling the car up the ramp is given by\n\n:<math>P_{\\mathrm{in}} = F V,\\!</math>\n\nand the power out is\n\n:<math>P_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\mathbf{W}\\cdot\\mathbf{v} = (0, W)\\cdot V (\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta) = WV\\sin\\theta.</math>\n\nEquate the power in to the power out to obtain the mechanical advantage as\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{MA} = \\frac{W}{F} = \\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta}.</math>\n\nThe mechanical advantage of an inclined can also be calculated from the ratio of length of the ramp ''L'' to its height ''H,'' because the sine of the angle of the ramp is given by\n:<math> \\sin\\theta = \\frac{H}{L},</math>\ntherefore,\n:<math> \\mathrm{MA} = \\frac{W}{F} = \\frac{L}{H}.</math>\n\n[[File:Plan inclin\u00e9 machine stationnaire Liverpool Minard.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Layout of the cable drive system for the Liverpool Minard inclined plane.]]\n\nExample: If the height of a ramp is H = 1 meter and its length is L = 5 meters, then the mechanical advantage is\n:<math> \\mathrm{MA} = \\frac{W}{F} = 5,</math>\nwhich means that a 20&nbsp;lb force will lift a 100&nbsp;lb load.\n\nThe Liverpool Minard inclined plane has the dimensions 1804 meters by 37.50 meters, which provides a mechanical advantage of\n:<math> \\mathrm{MA} = \\frac{W}{F} = 1804/37.50 = 48.1,</math>\nso a 100&nbsp;lb tension force on the cable will lift a 4810&nbsp;lb load.  The grade of this incline is 2%, which means the angle \u03b8 is small enough that sin\u03b8=tan\u03b8.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|cols=2}}\n* [[Canal inclined plane]]\n* [[Frictionless plane]]\n* [[Grade (slope)]]\n* [[Inclined plane railroad]]\n* [[Mechanical advantage]]\n* [[Schiefe Ebene]]\n* [[Simple machine]]\n* [[Stairs]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Inclined planes}}\n*[http://www.phy.hk/wiki/englishhtm/Incline.htm An interactive simulation of Physics inclined plane]\n<!-- This listing is better found in the article on simple machines {{Simple machines}}-->\n<!-- Inclined planes are not architectural elements link rooms -->\n\n{{Simple machines}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Simple machines]]"}]}}}}
