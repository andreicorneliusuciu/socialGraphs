Notice the setup is not restricted to 2d space, but a plane in any higher dimension.}}\n\nParticle kinematics is the study of the trajectory of a particle. The position of a particle is defined to be the coordinate vector from the origin of a coordinate frame to the particle. For example, consider a tower 50 m south from your home, where the coordinate frame is located at your home, such that East is the x-direction and North is the y-direction, then the coordinate vector to the base of the tower is '''r'''=(0, -50, 0). If the tower is 50 m high, then the coordinate vector to the top of the tower is '''r'''=(0, -50, 50)'''.\n\nIn the most general case, a three-dimensional coordinate system is used to define the position of a particle. However, if the particle is constrained to move in a surface, a two-dimensional coordinate system is sufficient. All observations in physics are incomplete without those observations being described with respect to a reference frame.\n\nThe position vector of a particle is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] drawn from the origin of the reference frame to the particle. It expresses both the distance of the point from the origin and its direction from the origin. In three dimensions, the position of point ''P'' can be expressed as\n: <math>\\mathbf{P} = (x_P,y_P,z_P) = x_P\\hat{i} + y_P\\hat{j} + z_P\\hat{k},</math>\nwhere ''x<sub>P</sub>'', ''y<sub>P</sub>'', and ''z<sub>P</sub>'' are the [[Cartesian coordinates]] and ''i'', ''j'' and ''k'' are the unit vectors along the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' coordinate axes, respectively. The magnitude of the position vector |'''P'''| gives the distance between the point ''P'' and the origin.\n: <math>|\\mathbf{P}| = \\sqrt{x_P^{\\ 2} + y_P^{\\ 2} + z_P^{\\ 2}}.</math>\nThe [[direction cosine]]s of the position vector provide a quantitative measure of direction.\nIt is important to note that the position vector of a particle isn't unique. The position vector of a given particle is different relative to different frames of reference.\n\nThe ''trajectory'' of a particle is a vector function of time, '''P'''(t), which defines the curve traced by the moving particle, given by\n: <math> \\mathbf{P}(t) = x_P(t)\\hat{i} + y_P(t)\\hat{j} +z_P(t) \\hat{k}, </math>\nwhere the coordinates ''x''<sub>P</sub>, ''y''<sub>P</sub>, and ''z''<sub>P</sub> are each functions of time.\n\n[[File:Distancedisplacement.svg|thumb|300px|right|The distance travelled is always greater than or equal to the displacement.]]\n\n===Velocity and speed===\nThe [[velocity]] of a particle is a vector quantity that describes the direction of motion and the magnitude of the motion of particle. More mathematically, the rate of change of the position vector of a point, with respect to time is the velocity of the point. Consider the ratio of the difference of two positions of a particle divided by the time interval, which is called the average velocity over that time interval. This average velocity is defined as\n: <math> \\overline{\\mathbf{V}} = \\frac {\\Delta \\mathbf{P}}{\\Delta t} \\ ,</math>\nwhere \u0394'''P''' is the change in the position vector over the time interval \u0394''t''.\n\nIn the limit as the time interval \u0394''t'' becomes smaller and smaller, the average velocity becomes the time derivative of the position vector,\n: <math> \\mathbf{V} = \\lim_{\\Delta t\\rightarrow0}\\frac{\\Delta\\mathbf{P}}{\\Delta t} = \\frac {d \\mathbf{P}}{d t}=\\dot{\\mathbf{P}} = \\dot{x}_p\\hat{i}+\\dot{y}_P\\hat{j}+\\dot{z}_P\\hat{k}.</math>\nThus, velocity is the time rate of change of position of a point, and the dot denotes the derivative of those functions x, y, and z with respect to time.  Furthermore, the velocity is [[tangent]] to the trajectory of the particle at every position the particle occupies along its path. Note that in a non-rotating frame of reference, the derivatives of the coordinate directions are not considered as their directions and magnitudes are constants.\n\nThe [[speed]] of an object is the magnitude |'''V'''| of its velocity. It is a scalar quantity:\n: <math> |\\mathbf{V}| = |\\dot{\\mathbf{P}} | =  \\frac {d s}{d t},</math>\nwhere ''s'' is the arc-length measured along the trajectory of the particle.  This arc-length traveled by a particle over time is a non-decreasing quantity. Hence, ''ds''/''dt'' is non-negative, which implies that speed is also non-negative.\n\n===Acceleration===\nThe velocity vector can change in magnitude and in direction or both at once. Hence, the acceleration is the rate of change of the magnitude of the velocity vector plus the rate of change of direction of that vector. The same reasoning used with respect to the position of a particle to define velocity, can be applied to the velocity to define acceleration. The [[acceleration]] of a particle is the vector defined by the rate of change of the velocity vector.  The average acceleration of a particle over a time interval is defined as the ratio.\n: <math> \\overline{\\mathbf{A}} = \\frac {\\Delta \\mathbf{V}}{\\Delta t} \\ ,</math>\nwhere \u0394'''V''' is the difference in the velocity vector and \u0394''t'' is the time interval.\n\nThe acceleration of the particle is the limit of the average acceleration as the time interval approaches zero, which is the time derivative,\n:Eqn 1)  <math> \\mathbf{A} = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\Delta \\mathbf{V}}{\\Delta t} = \\frac {d \\mathbf{V}}{d t} = \\dot{\\mathbf{V}} = \\dot{v}_x\\hat{i}+\\dot{v}_y\\hat{j}+\\dot{v}_z\\hat{k} </math>\nor\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{A} = \\ddot{\\mathbf{P}} = \\ddot{x}_p\\hat{i}+\\ddot{y}_P\\hat{j}+\\ddot{z}_P\\hat{k} </math>\nThus, acceleration is the first derivative of the velocity vector and the second derivative of the position vector  of that particle. Note that in a non-rotating frame of reference, the derivatives of the coordinate directions are not considered as their directions and magnitudes are constants.\n\nThe magnitude of the [[acceleration]] of an object is the magnitude |'''A'''| of its acceleration vector. It is a scalar quantity:\n: <math> |\\mathbf{A}| = |\\dot{\\mathbf{V}} | =  \\frac {d v}{d t},</math>\n\n===Relative position vector===\n[[Displacement (vector)|A relative position vector]] is a vector that defines the position of one point relative to another.  It is the difference in position of the two points.\nThe position of one point ''A'' relative to another point ''B'' is simply the difference between their positions\n\n<math>\\mathbf{P}_{A/B} = \\mathbf{P}_{A} - \\mathbf{P}_{B}  </math>\n\nwhich is the difference between the components of their position vectors.\n\nIf point ''A'' has position components \n<math>\\mathbf{P}_{A} = \\left( X_{A}, Y_{A}, Z_{A} \\right) </math>\n\nIf point ''B'' has position components \n<math>\\mathbf{P}_{B} = \\left( X_{B}, Y_{B}, Z_{B} \\right) </math>\n\nthen the position of point ''A'' relative to point ''B'' is the difference between their components: \n<math>\\mathbf{P}_{A/B} = \\mathbf{P}_{A} - \\mathbf{P}_{B}  = \\left( X_{A} - X_{B}, Y_{A} - Y_{B}, Z_{A} - Z_{B} \\right) </math>\n\n===Relative velocity===\n{{main article|Relative velocity}}\n[[File:Relative velocity.svg|300px|thumb|Relative velocities between two particles in classical mechanics.]]\n\nThe velocity of one point relative to another is simply the difference between their velocities\n\n<math>\\mathbf{V}_{A/B} = \\mathbf{V}_{A} - \\mathbf{V}_{B}  </math>\n\nwhich is the difference between the components of their velocities.\n\nIf point ''A'' has velocity components \n<math>\\mathbf{V}_{A} = \\left( V_{A_{x}}, V_{A_{y}}, V_{A_{z}} \\right) </math>\n\nand point ''B'' has velocity components \n<math>\\mathbf{V}_{B} = \\left( V_{B_{x}}, V_{B_{y}}, V_{B_{z}} \\right) </math>\n\nthen the velocity of point ''A'' relative to point ''B'' is the difference between their components: \n<math>\\mathbf{V}_{A/B} = \\mathbf{V}_{A} - \\mathbf{V}_{B}  = \\left( V_{A_{x}}-V_{B_{x}}, V_{A_{y}}-V_{B_{y}}, V_{A_{z}}-V_{B_{z}} \\right) </math>\n\nAlternatively, this same result could be obtained by computing the time derivative of the relative position vector '''R'''<sub>B/A</sub>.\n\nIn the case where the velocity is close to the [[speed of light]] ''c'' (generally within 95%), another scheme of relative velocity called [[rapidity]], that depends on the ratio of V to c, is used in [[special relativity]].\n\n===Relative acceleration===\n\nThe acceleration of one point ''C''  relative to another point ''B'' is simply the difference between their accelerations.\n\n<math>\\mathbf{A}_{C/B} = \\mathbf{A}_{C} - \\mathbf{A}_{B}  </math>\n\nwhich is the difference between the components of their accelerations.\n\nIf point ''C'' has acceleration components \n<math>\\mathbf{A}_{C} = \\left( A_{C_{x}}, A_{C_{y}}, A_{C_{z}} \\right) </math>\n\nand point ''B'' has acceleration components \n<math>\\mathbf{A}_{B} = \\left( A_{B_{x}}, A_{B_{y}}, A_{B_{z}} \\right) </math>\n\nthen the acceleration of point ''C'' relative to point ''B'' is the difference between their components: \n<math>\\mathbf{A}_{C/B} = \\mathbf{A}_{C} - \\mathbf{A}_{B}  = \\left( A_{C_{x}} - A_{B_{x}} , A_{C_{y}} - A_{B_{y}} , A_{C_{z}} - A_{B_{z}}   \\right) </math>\n\nAlternatively, this same result could be obtained by computing the second time derivative of the relative position vector '''P'''<sub>B/A</sub>.\n\n== Particle trajectories under constant acceleration ==\n\nFor the case of constant acceleration, the differential equation Eq 1) can be integrated as the acceleration vector '''A''' of a point ''P'' is constant in magnitude and direction. Such a point is said to be undergoing ''uniformly accelerated motion''. In this case, the velocity  '''V'''(t) and then the trajectory '''P'''(t) of the particle can be obtained by integrating the acceleration equation '''A''' with respect to time.\n\nAssuming that the initial conditions of the position, <math>\\mathbf{P}_0</math>, and velocity <math>\\mathbf{V}_0</math> are known, the first integration yields the velocity of the particle as a function of time.\n: <math>\\mathbf{V}(t) = \\int_0^{t} \\mathbf{A} dt = \\mathbf{A}t + \\mathbf{V}_0.</math>\n\nA second integration yields its path (trajectory),\n: <math>\\mathbf{P}(t) = \\int_0^t \\mathbf{V}(t) dt = \\int(\\mathbf{A}t + \\mathbf{V}_0)dt = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\mathbf{A} t^2 + \\mathbf{V}_0 t + \\mathbf{P}_0. </math>\n\nAdditional relations between displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time can be derived. Since the acceleration is constant,  \n: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\frac{\\Delta\\mathbf{V}}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{\\mathbf{V}-\\mathbf{V}_0}{ t } </math> can be substituted into the above equation to give:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{P}(t) = \\mathbf{P}_0 + \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{V} + \\mathbf{V}_0}{2}\\right) t .</math>\n\nA relationship between velocity, position and acceleration without explicit time dependence can be had by solving the average acceleration for time and substituting and simplifying\n\n: <math> t = \\frac{\\mathbf{V}-\\mathbf{V}_0}{ \\mathbf{A} } </math>\n\n: <math> (\\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{P}_0) \\circ  \\mathbf{A}  = \\left( \\mathbf{V} - \\mathbf{V}_0 \\right) \\circ \\frac{\\mathbf{V} + \\mathbf{V}_0}{2}  \\ , </math>\nwhere \u2218 denotes the [[dot product]], which is appropriate as the products are scalars rather than vectors. \n: <math>2(\\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{P}_0) \\circ \\mathbf{A} = |\\mathbf{V}|^2 - |\\mathbf{V}_0|^2.</math>\n\nThe dot can be replaced by the cosine of the angle \u221d between the vectors and the vectors by their magnitudes, in which case:\n: <math>2(|\\mathbf{P}| - |\\mathbf{P}_0|) |\\mathbf{A}| \\, cosine\\left( \\alpha \\right) = |\\mathbf{V}|^2 - |\\mathbf{V}_0|^2.</math>\n\nIn the case of acceleration always in the direction of the motion \u221d = 0, cosine(0) = 1 and, \n: <math> |\\mathbf{V}|^2= |\\mathbf{V}_0|^2 + 2 |\\mathbf{A}|(|\\mathbf{P}-\\mathbf{P}_0|).</math>\nThis can be simplified using the notation for the magnitudes of the vectors <math>|\\mathbf{A}|=a, |\\mathbf{V}|=v, |\\mathbf{P}-\\mathbf{P}_0|=\\delta s </math> where <math>\\delta s</math> can be any curvaceous path taken as the constant tangential acceleration is applied along that path, so\n: <math> v^2= v_0^2 + 2a(\\delta s).</math>\nThis reduces the parametric equations of motion of the particle to a cartesian relationship of speed versus position. This relation is useful when time is not known explicitly.\n\n[[File:Nonuniform circular motion.svg|thumb|250px|Figure 2: Velocity and acceleration for nonuniform circular motion: the velocity vector is tangential to the orbit, but the acceleration vector is not radially inward because of its tangential component '''a'''<sub>''\u03b8''</sub> that increases the rate of rotation: d''\u03c9''/d''t'' = <nowiki>|</nowiki>'''a'''<sub>''\u03b8''</sub><nowiki>|</nowiki>/''R''.]]\n\n== Particle trajectories in cylindrical-polar coordinates ==\n{{see also|Generalized coordinates|Curvilinear coordinates|Orthogonal coordinates|Frenet-Serret formulas}}\n\nIt is often convenient to formulate the trajectory of a particle '''P'''(t) = (X(t), Y(t) and Z(t)) using polar coordinates in the ''X''-''Y'' plane. In this case, its velocity and acceleration take a convenient form.\n\nRecall that the trajectory of a particle ''P'' is defined by its coordinate vector '''P''' measured in a fixed reference frame ''F''.  As the particle moves, its coordinate vector '''P'''(t) traces its trajectory, which is a curve in space, given by:\n: <math> \\textbf{P}(t) = X(t)\\hat{i} + Y(t)\\hat{j} + Z(t)\\hat{k},</math>\nwhere ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'' are the unit vectors along the ''X'', ''Y'' and ''Z'' axes of the [[Cartesian coordinate system|reference frame]] ''F'', respectively.\n\nConsider a particle ''P'' that moves only on the surface of a circular cylinder R(t)=constant, it is possible to align the ''Z'' axis of the fixed frame ''F'' with the axis of the cylinder.

This reduces the description of the motion of the various parts of a complicated mechanical system to a problem of describing the geometry of each part and geometric association of each part relative to other parts.\n\n[[Geometry]] is the study of the properties of figures that remain the same while the space is transformed in various ways---more technically, it is the study of invariants under a set of transformations.<ref>Geometry: the study of properties of given elements that remain invariant under specified transformations. {{cite web |title=Definition of geometry |publisher=Merriam-Webster on-line dictionary |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/geometry}}</ref> These transformations can cause the displacement of the triangle in the plane, while leaving the vertex angle and the distances between vertices unchanged.  Kinematics is often described as applied geometry, where the movement of a mechanical system is described using the rigid transformations of Euclidean geometry.\n\nThe coordinates of points in a plane are two-dimensional vectors in '''R'''<sup>2</sup> (two dimensional space). Rigid transformations are those that preserve the [[distance formula|distance]] between any two points. The set of rigid transformations in an ''n''-dimensional space is called the special [[Euclidean group]] on '''R'''<sup>n</sup>, and denoted ''[[SE(n)]].''\n\n===Displacements and motion===\n[[File:SteamEngine Boulton&Watt 1784.png|thumb|right|300px|alt=Boulton & Watt Steam Engine|The movement of each of the components of the Boulton & Watt Steam Engine (1784) is modeled by a continuous set of rigid displacements.]]\nThe position of one component of a mechanical system relative to another is defined by introducing a [[Cartesian coordinate system|reference frame]], say ''M'', on one that moves relative to a fixed frame, ''F,'' on the other.  The rigid transformation, or displacement, of ''M'' relative to ''F'' defines the relative position of the two components.  A displacement consists of the combination of a [[rotation]] and a [[translation (geometry)|translation]].\n\nThe set of all displacements of ''M'' relative to ''F'' is called the [[configuration space]] of ''M.''  A smooth curve from one position to another in this configuration space is a continuous set of displacements, called the [[motion (physics)|motion]] of ''M'' relative to ''F.'' The motion of a body consists of a continuous set of rotations and translations.\n\n===Matrix representation===\nThe combination of a rotation and translation in the plane '''R'''<sup>2</sup> can be represented by a certain type of 3x3 matrix known as a homogeneous transform.  The 3x3 homogeneous transform is constructed from a 2x2 [[rotation matrix]] A(\u03c6) and the 2x1 translation vector '''d'''=(d<sub>x</sub>, d<sub>y</sub>), as:\n: <math> [T(\\phi, \\mathbf{d})] = \\begin{bmatrix} A(\\phi) & \\mathbf{d} \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix} \n= \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\phi & -\\sin\\phi & d_x \\\\ \\sin\\phi & \\cos\\phi & d_y \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\nThese homogeneous transforms perform rigid transformations on the points in the plane z=1, that is on points with coordinates '''p'''=(x, y, 1).\n\nIn particular, let '''p''' define the coordinates of points in a reference frame ''M'' coincident with a fixed frame ''F.''  Then, when the origin of ''M'' is displaced by the translation vector '''d''' relative to the origin of ''F'' and rotated by the angle \u03c6 relative to the x-axis of ''F,'' the new coordinates in ''F'' of points in ''M'' are given by:\n: <math> \\textbf{P} =  [T(\\phi, \\mathbf{d})]\\textbf{p} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos\\phi & -\\sin\\phi & d_x \\\\ \\sin\\phi & \\cos\\phi & d_y \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{Bmatrix}x\\\\y\\\\1\\end{Bmatrix}.</math>\n\nHomogeneous transforms represent [[affine transformation]]s.  This formulation is necessary because a [[translation (geometry)|translation]] is not a [[linear transformation]] of '''R'''<sup>2</sup>.  However, using projective geometry, so that '''R'''<sup>2</sup> is considered to be a subset of '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, translations become affine linear transformations.<ref>{{cite book |last=Paul |first=Richard |title=Robot manipulators: mathematics, programming, and control : the computer control of robot manipulators |publisher=MIT Press, Cambridge, MA |year=1981 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UzZ3LAYqvRkC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-0-262-16082-7}}</ref>\n\n== Pure translation ==\n\nIf a rigid body moves so that its [[Cartesian coordinate system|reference frame]] ''M'' does not rotate (\u2205=0) relative to the fixed frame ''F'', the motion is said to be pure translation.

The vector '''r'''(''t'') has some projection (or, equivalently, some component) '''r'''<sub>\u22a5</sub>(''t'') on a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Then the ''angular position'' of that point is the angle \u03b8 from a reference axis (typically the positive ''x''-axis) to the vector '''r'''<sub>\u22a5</sub>(''t'') in a known rotation sense (typically given by the [[right-hand rule]]).\n* '''Angular velocity''' : the angular velocity ''\u03c9'' is the rate at which the angular position ''\u03b8'' changes with respect to time t:\n:: <math>\\omega = \\frac {d\\theta}{dt}</math>\n: The angular velocity is represented in Figure 1 by a vector '''\u03a9''' pointing along the axis of rotation with magnitude ''\u03c9'' and sense determined by the direction of rotation as given by the [[right-hand rule]].\n* '''Angular acceleration''' : the magnitude of the angular acceleration ''\u03b1'' is the rate at which the angular velocity ''\u03c9'' changes with respect to time t:\n:: <math>\\alpha = \\frac {d\\omega}{dt}</math>\n\nThe equations of translational kinematics can easily be extended to planar rotational kinematics for constant angular acceleration with simple variable exchanges:\n: <math>\\omega_{\\mathrm{f}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{i}} + \\alpha t\\!</math>\n: <math>\\theta_{\\mathrm{f}} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{i}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{i}} t + \\tfrac{1}{2} \\alpha t^2</math>\n: <math>\\theta_{\\mathrm{f}} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{i}} = \\tfrac{1}{2} (\\omega_{\\mathrm{f}} + \\omega_{\\mathrm{i}})t</math>\n: <math>\\omega_{\\mathrm{f}}^2 = \\omega_{\\mathrm{i}}^2 + 2 \\alpha (\\theta_{\\mathrm{f}} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{i}}).</math>\n\nHere ''\u03b8''<sub>i</sub> and ''\u03b8''<sub>f</sub> are, respectively, the initial and final angular positions, ''\u03c9''<sub>i</sub> and ''\u03c9''<sub>f</sub> are, respectively, the initial and final angular velocities, and ''\u03b1'' is the constant angular acceleration. Although position in space and velocity in space are both true vectors (in terms of their properties under rotation), as is angular velocity, angle itself is not a true vector.\n\n== Point trajectories in body moving in three dimensions ==\n\nImportant formulas in kinematics define the [[velocity]] and acceleration of points in a moving body as they trace trajectories in three-dimensional space. This is particularly important for the center of mass of a body, which is used to derive equations of motion using either [[Newton's second law]] or [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]].\n\n===Position===\nIn order to define these formulas, the movement of a component ''B'' of a mechanical system is defined by the set of rotations [A(t)] and translations '''d'''(t) assembled into the homogeneous transformation [T(t)]=[A(t), '''d'''(t)].  If '''p''' is the coordinates of a point ''P'' in ''B'' measured in the moving [[Cartesian coordinate system|reference frame]] ''M'', then the trajectory of this point traced in ''F'' is given by:\n: <math> \\textbf{P}(t)=[T(t)]\\textbf{p} = \n\\begin{Bmatrix} \\textbf{P} \\\\ 1\\end{Bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix} A(t) & \\textbf{d}(t) \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{Bmatrix} \\textbf{p} \\\\ 1\\end{Bmatrix}.</math>\nThis notation does not distinguish between '''P''' = (X, Y, Z, 1), and '''P''' = (X, Y, Z), which is hopefully clear in context.\n\nThis equation for the trajectory of ''P'' can be inverted to compute the coordinate vector '''p''' in ''M'' as:\n: <math> \\textbf{p} = [T(t)]^{-1}\\textbf{P}(t) = \n\\begin{Bmatrix} \\textbf{p} \\\\ 1\\end{Bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix} A(t)^T & -A(t)^T\\textbf{d}(t) \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{Bmatrix} \\textbf{P}(t) \\\\ 1\\end{Bmatrix}.</math>\nThis expression uses the fact that the transpose of a rotation matrix is also its inverse, that is:\n: <math> [A(t)]^T[A(t)]=I.\\!</math>\n\n===Velocity===\nThe velocity of the point ''P'' along its trajectory '''P'''(t) is obtained as the time derivative of this position vector,\n: <math> \\textbf{V}_P = [\\dot{T}(t)]\\textbf{p} =\n\\begin{Bmatrix} \\textbf{V}_P \\\\ 0\\end{Bmatrix} = \\dot{\\begin{bmatrix} A(t) & \\textbf{d}(t) \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}}\n\\begin{Bmatrix} \\textbf{p} \\\\ 1\\end{Bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\dot{A}(t) & \\dot{\\textbf{d}}(t) \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{Bmatrix} \\textbf{p} \\\\ 1\\end{Bmatrix}.</math>\nThe dot denotes the derivative with respect to time; because '''p''' is constant, its derivative is zero.\n\nThis formula can be modified to obtain the velocity of ''P'' by operating on its trajectory '''P'''(t) measured in the fixed frame ''F''.

Kinematic constraints can be considered to have two basic forms, (i) constraints that arise from hinges, sliders and cam joints that define the construction of the system, called [[holonomic system|holonomic constraints]], and (ii) constraints imposed on the velocity of the system such as the knife-edge constraint of ice-skates on a flat plane, or rolling without slipping of a disc or sphere in contact with a plane, which are called [[non-holonomic system|non-holonomic constraints]]. The following are some common examples.\n\n===Kinematic coupling===\nA [[kinematic coupling]] exactly constrains all 6 degrees of freedom.\n\n===Rolling without slipping===\nAn object that rolls against a [[Surface (topology)|surface]] without slipping obeys the condition that the [[velocity]] of its [[center of mass]] is equal to the [[cross product]] of its angular velocity with a vector from the point of contact to the center of mass:\n: <math> \\boldsymbol{ v}_G(t) = \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} \\times \\boldsymbol{ r}_{G/O}.</math>\n\nFor the case of an object that does not tip or turn, this reduces to <math> v = r \\omega</math>.\n\n===Inextensible cord===\nThis is the case where bodies are connected by an idealized cord that remains in tension and cannot change length.

There are the following cases:\n* A revolute pair, or hinged joint, requires a line, or axis, in the moving body to remain co-linear with a line in the fixed body, and a plane perpendicular to this line in the moving body maintain contact with a similar perpendicular plane in the fixed body. This imposes five constraints on the relative movement of the links, which therefore has one degree of freedom, which is pure rotation about the axis of the hinge.\n* A prismatic joint, or slider,  requires that a line, or axis, in the moving body remain co-linear with a line in the fixed body, and a plane parallel to this line in the moving body maintain contact with a similar parallel plane in the fixed body. This imposes five constraints on the relative movement of the links, which therefore has one degree of freedom. This degree of freedom is the distance of the slide along the line.\n* A cylindrical joint requires that a line, or axis,  in the moving body remain co-linear with a line in the fixed body.  It is a combination of a revolute joint and a sliding joint.  This joint has two degrees of freedom. The position of the moving body is defined by both the rotation about and slide along the axis.\n* A spherical joint, or ball joint, requires that a point in the moving body maintain contact with a point in the fixed body. This joint has three degrees of freedom.\n* A planar joint requires that a plane in the moving body maintain contact with a plane in fixed body. This joint has three degrees of freedom.\n\n====Higher pairs====\nGenerally speaking, a higher pair is a constraint that requires a curve or surface in the moving body to maintain contact with a curve or surface in the fixed body.   For example, the contact between a cam and its follower is a higher pair called a ''cam joint''.  Similarly, the contact between the involute curves that form the meshing teeth of two gears are cam joints.\n\n===Kinematic chains===\n[[File:Kinematics of Machinery - Figure 21.jpg|thumb|right|300px|img_alt=Illustration of a Four-bar linkage from Kinematics of Machinery, 1876|Illustration of a four-bar linkage from http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Kinematics_of_Machinery Kinematics of Machinery, 1876]]\nRigid bodies (\"links\") connected by [[kinematic pair]]s (\"joints\") are known as ''[[kinematic chain]]s.''  [[Mechanism (engineering)|Mechanisms]] and robots are examples of kinematic chains.
