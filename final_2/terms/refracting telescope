The refracting telescope design was originally used in spy glasses and [[astronomical]] telescopes but is also used for [[Long focus lens|long focus]] camera lenses. Although large refracting telescopes were very popular in the second half of the 19th century, for most research purposes the refracting telescope has been superseded by the [[reflecting telescope]] which allows larger apertures. A refractor's magnification is calculated by dividing the focal length of the objective lens by that of the eyepiece.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northern-stars.com/tel_magnification.htm|title=Telescope Calculations|publisher=Northern Stars|accessdate=2013-12-20}}</ref>\n\n==Invention==\n{{Main|History of the telescope}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}\nRefractors were the earliest type of [[optical telescope]]. The first practical refracting telescopes appeared in the [[Netherlands]] about 1608, and were credited to three individuals, [[Hans Lippershey]] and [[Zacharias Janssen]], spectacle-makers in [[Middelburg]], and [[Jacob Metius]] of [[Alkmaar]]. [[Galileo Galilei]], happening to be in [[Venice]] in about the month of May 1609, heard of the invention and constructed a version of his own. Galileo then communicated the details of his invention to the public, and presented the instrument itself to the [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] [[Leonardo Donato]], sitting in full council.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aip.org/history/cosmology/tools/tools-first-telescopes.htm|title=The First Telescopes|publisher=American Institute of Physics|accessdate=15 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=l3MOCO6F6ZkC&pg=PT649&lpg=PT649&dq=Refractors+were+the+earliest+type+of+optical+telescope&source=bl&ots=vp-wFCckvs&sig=rGMl_VzbfFoA_CyaEYqUdRbDRBg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBWoVChMIz8yI54PcxgIVyb4UCh17yQY_#v=onepage&q=Refractors%20were%20the%20earliest%20type%20of%20optical%20telescope&f=false|title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers, Refractors were the earliest type of optical telescope|publisher=Raymond A.

The combination of an [[objective (optics)|objective]] [[lens (optics)|lens]] '''1''' and some type of [[eyepiece]] '''2''' is used to gather more light than the human eye is able to collect on its own, focus it '''5''', and present the viewer with a [[brightness|brighter]], [[wikt:clarity|clearer]], and [[magnification|magnified]] [[virtual image]] '''6'''.\n\nThe objective in a refracting telescope [[refraction|refracts]] or bends [[light]]. This refraction causes [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] light rays to converge at a [[Focus (optics)|focal point]]; while those not parallel converge upon a [[focal plane]]. The telescope converts a bundle of parallel rays to make an angle \u03b1, with the optical axis to a second parallel bundle with angle \u03b2. The ratio \u03b2/\u03b1 is called the angular magnification. It equals the ratio between the retinal image sizes obtained with and without the telescope.<ref>Stephen G. Lipson, Ariel Lipson, Henry Lipson, ''Optical Physics 4th Edition'', Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-0-521-49345-1</ref>\n\nRefracting telescopes can come in many different configurations to correct for image orientation and types of aberration. Because the image was formed by the bending of light, or refraction, these telescopes are called ''refracting telescopes'' or ''refractors''.\n\n===Galileo's telescope===\n<!--- The article Galileo Galilei links here.

It used a convergent (plano-convex) objective lens and a divergent (plano-concave) eyepiece lens (Galileo, 1610).<ref>Sidereus Nuncius or The Sidereal Messenger, 1610, Galileo Galilei ''et al.'', 1989, pg. 37, The University of Chicago Press, Albert van Helden tr., (History Dept. Rice University, Houston, TX), ISBN 0-226-27903-0.</ref> A Galilean telescope, because the design has no intermediary focus, results in a non-inverted and upright image.\n\nGalileo\u2019s best telescope [[Magnification|magnified]] objects about 30 times. Because of flaws in its design, such as the shape of the lens and the narrow field of view, the images were blurry and distorted. Despite these flaws, the telescope was still good enough for Galileo to explore the sky. The Galilean telescope could view the [[phases of Venus]], and was able to see [[impact crater|craters]] on the [[Moon]] and four [[Galilean moons|moons]] orbiting Jupiter.\n\nParallel rays of light from a distant object ('''y''') would be brought to a focus in the focal plane of the objective lens ('''F\u2032 L1 / y\u2032'''). The (diverging) eyepiece ('''L2''') lens intercepts these rays and renders them parallel once more. Non-parallel rays of light from the object traveling at an angle '''\u03b11''' to the optical axis travel at a larger angle ('''\u03b12 > \u03b11''')  after they passed through the eyepiece. This leads to an increase in the apparent angular size and is responsible for the perceived magnification.\n\nThe final image ('''y\u2033''') is a virtual image, located at infinity and is the same way up as the object.\n\n===Keplerian telescope===\n[[File:Houghton Typ 620.73.451 - Johannes Hevelius, Machinae coelestis, 1673.jpg|thumb|right|Woodcut illustration of a {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} focal length Keplerian astronomical refracting telescope built by Johannes Hevelius.<ref>{{cite book |first=Johannes |last=Hevelius |title=Machina Coelestis |volume=First Part |date=1673 |publisher=Auctor}}</ref>]]\nThe '''Keplerian telescope''', invented by [[Johannes Kepler]] in 1611, is an improvement on Galileo's design.<ref>{{cite book |title= Optics|last= Tunnacliffe|first= AH |author2=Hirst JG |date= 1996|publisher= |location= Kent, England |isbn= 0-900099-15-1|page= |pages= 233\u20137|url= }}</ref> It uses a convex lens as the eyepiece instead of Galileo's concave one. The advantage of this arrangement is that the rays of light emerging from the eyepiece are converging. This allows for a much wider field of view and greater [[eye relief]], but the image for the viewer is inverted. Considerably higher magnifications can be reached with this design, but to overcome aberrations the simple objective lens needs to have a very high [[Focal ratio|f-ratio]] ([[Johannes Hevelius]] built one with a {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=out|adj=on|order=flip}} [[focal length]], and even longer tubeless \"[[aerial telescope]]s\" were constructed). The design also allows for use of a [[Filar micrometer#Prior devices|micrometer]] at the focal plane (used to determine the angular size and/or distance between objects observed).\n\n===Achromatic refractors===\n{{Main|Achromatic telescope}}\nThe '''[[Achromatic lens|achromatic]]''' refracting lens was invented in 1733 by an English barrister named [[Chester Moore Hall]], although it was independently invented and patented by [[John Dollond]] around 1758. The design overcame the need for very long focal lengths in refracting telescopes by using an objective made of two pieces of [[glass]] with different [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], \"[[Crown glass (optics)|crown]]\" and \"[[flint glass]]\",  to limit the effects of [[chromatic aberration|chromatic]] and [[spherical aberration]].  Each side of each piece is ground and [[polishing|polish]]ed, and then the two pieces are assembled together. Achromatic lenses are corrected to bring two [[wavelength]]s (typically red and blue) into focus in the same plane. The era of the [[Great refractors]] in the 19th century saw large achromatic lenses culminating with largest achromatic refractor ever built, the [[Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900]].\n\n===Apochromatic refractors===\n{{Main|Apochromat}}\n'''Apochromatic refractors''' have objectives built with special, extra-low dispersion materials. They are designed to bring three wavelengths (typically red, green, and blue) into focus in the same plane. The residual color error (tertiary spectrum) can be up to an order of magnitude less than that of an achromatic lens.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Such telescopes contain elements of [[fluorite]] or special, extra-low dispersion (ED) glass in the objective and produce a very crisp image that is virtually free of chromatic aberration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://starizona.com/acb/ccd/equipbasicsref.aspx |title=Starizona's Guide to CCD Imaging |publisher=Starizona.com |accessdate=17 October 2013}}</ref> Due to the special materials needed in the fabrication, apochromatic refractors are usually more expensive than telescopes of other types with a comparable aperture.\n\n== Technical considerations ==\n[[Image:Yerkes Observatory Astro4p7.jpg|thumb|right|The {{convert|40|in|m|order=flip|abbr=out|adj=on|sp=us}} refractor, at [[Yerkes Observatory]], the largest achromatic refractor ever put into astronomical use]]\nRefractors suffer from residual [[chromatic aberration|chromatic]] and [[spherical aberration]]. This affects shorter [[focal length]]s more than longer ones.  A {{convert|4|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} {{f/|6|link=yes}} achromatic refractor is likely to show considerable color fringing (generally a purple halo around bright objects). A {{convert|4|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} {{f/}}16 has little color fringing.\n\nIn very large apertures, there is also a problem of [[lens sag]]ging, a result of [[gravity]] deforming [[glass]]. Since a lens can only be held in place by its edge, the center of a large lens sags due to gravity, distorting the images it produces. The largest practical lens size in a refracting telescope is around {{convert|1|m|in|abbr=out|sp=us}}.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=OJclbOHqrD0C&pg=PT532 \"Physics Demystified\" By Stan Gibilisco, ISBN 0-07-138201-1, page 515]</ref>\n\nThere is a further problem of glass defects, striae or small [[air bubble]]s trapped within the glass. In addition, glass is [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] to certain [[wavelength]]s, and even [[optical spectrum|visible light]] is dimmed by reflection and absorption when it crosses the air-glass interfaces and passes through the glass itself. Most of these problems are avoided or diminished in [[reflecting telescope]]s, which can be made in far larger apertures and which have all but replaced refractors for astronomical research.\n\n==List of research refracting telescopes==\n{{cleanup gallery|date=May 2014}}\nA list of some of the larger research refracting telescopes over {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} diameter.\n* [[Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900]] ({{convert|1.25|m|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) \u2013 dismantled after exhibition\n* [[Yerkes Observatory]] ({{convert|40|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip|disp=or}})\n* [[Swedish Solar Telescope|Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope]] ({{convert|98|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}})\n* [[Lick Observatory]] ({{convert|36|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip|disp=or}})\n* [[Paris Observatory]] ({{convert|83|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}, + {{convert|62|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}})\n* [[Nice Observatory]] ({{convert|77|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}})\n* [[Archenhold Observatory]] \u2013 the longest refracting telescope ever built ({{convert|68|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} \u00d7 {{convert|21|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} focal length)\n* [[Lowell Observatory]] ({{convert|24|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip|disp=or}})\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Potsdam Great Refractor.jpg|The Great Refractor at the [[Astrophysical Institute Potsdam]], [[Germany]]\nImage:Grande Lunette Nice.jpg|The {{convert|76|cm|abbr=on|lk=in}} refractor at [[Nice Observatory]]\nImage:ArchenholdObservatory-GreatRefractor.jpg|The Great Refractor at the [[Archenhold Observatory]] in Berlin\nImage:Refraktor Wien Kerschbaum 1.jpg|The {{convert|68|cm|abbr=on|lk=in}} refractor at the [[Vienna Observatory|Vienna University Observatory]]\nImage:TwentyInchTelescope.JPG|{{convert|20|in|cm|adj=on|abbr=out|order=flip|sp=us}} refractor at the Observatories at [[Chabot Space & Science Center]] in [[Oakland, California]]\nImage:EightInchTelescope.JPG|{{convert|8|in|cm|adj=on|abbr=out|order=flip|sp=us}} refractor at the Observatories at [[Chabot Space & Science Center]] in [[Oakland, California]]\nImage:Aachen Refraktor.JPG|Refractor at the Observatory in [[Aachen]], Germany\nFile:Lowell Observatory - Clark telescope.jpg|The [[Alvan Clark]] Refractor Telescope at [[Lowell Observatory]] in [[Flagstaff, AZ]]\nFile:Irving_Porter_Church_Telescope.jpg|The 30&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in) Irving Porter Church Memorial Refractor at [[Fuertes Observatory]] in [[Ithaca, NY]]\nImage:Refraktor.png|Diagram of a commercial refractor\nImage:ApoRef.png|Apochromatic refractor\nFile:TeleskopOrangerieKassel.jpg|Coin-operated telescope in [[Germany]]\nFile:2009 Austria 25 Euro Year of Astronomy Front.jpg|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2009 Coinage|International Year of Astronomy commemorative Austrian coin]] featuring a refracting telescope\nFile:Antique Telescope at the Quito Astronomical Observatory 002.JPG|Inside the [[Quito Astronomical Observatory]] is this 1875 [[Merz Telescopes|Georg Merz and Sons]], 24&nbsp;cm vintage Refracting telescope on an  [[Equatorial mount]].\n\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Baden-Powell's Unilens]]\n* [[Astrograph]]\n* [[Catadioptric telescope]]s\n* [[List of largest optical refracting telescopes]]\n* [[List of largest optical telescopes historically]]\n* [[List of telescope types]]\n* [[Reflecting telescope]]\n* [[Star diagonal]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Refracting telescopes}}\n* [http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/informal/features/F_Build_a_Telescope_prt.htm nasa.gov \u2013 Build a Telescope]\n* [http://galileo.rice.edu/lib/student_work/astronomy96/mtelescope.html  Making a Galilean Telescope]\n* [http://www.pacifier.com/~tpope/Building_A_Galilean_Telescope.htm BUILDING A GALILEAN TELESCOPE]\n* [http://www.pacifier.com/~tpope/Galilean_Optics_Page.htm OPTICS OF THE SINGLET REFRACTOR:  GALILEO vs. KEPLER]\n*[http://journals.lww.com/optvissci/Fulltext/2007/06000/Angular_and_Linear_Fields_of_View_of_Galilean.16.aspx  Angular and Linear Fields of View of Galilean Telescopes and Telemicroscopes]\n*[http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=229181 Refracting telescopes]\n*[http://www.telescope1609.com/Telescope.htm Introduction to Galileo's Telescope]\n*[http://www.transtutors.com/physics-homework-help/optical-instruments/Galilean-telescope.aspx Homework Help with Galilean Telescope]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Refracting Telescope}}\n[[Category:Telescopes]]\n[[Category:Telescope types]]\n[[Category:Dutch inventions]]"}]}}}}
