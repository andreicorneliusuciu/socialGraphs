They are mainly used in [[front wheel drive]] vehicles, and many modern [[rear wheel drive]] [[automobile|car]]s with [[independent rear suspension]] typically use CV joints at the ends of the rear axle halfshafts and increasingly use them on the propshafts ([[drive shaft]]s).\n\nConstant-velocity joints are protected by a rubber boot, a CV gaiter, usually filled with [[molybdenum disulfide]] grease. Cracks and splits in the boot will allow contaminants in, which would cause the joint to wear quickly.\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Universal joint.gif|right|frame|A universal joint, an earlier means of transmitting power between two angled shafts.]]\n{{main|Universal joint}}\nThe [[universal joint]], one of the earliest means of transmitting power between two angled shafts, was invented by [[Gerolamo Cardano]] in the 16th century. The fact that it failed to maintain constant velocity during rotation was recognized by [[Robert Hooke]] in the 17th century, who proposed the first constant velocity joint, consisting of two Cardan joints offset by 90 degrees, so as to cancel out the velocity variations. This is the \"double Cardan\", shown below. Many different types of constant-velocity joints have been invented since then.\n\n== Early automotive drive systems ==\nEarly front wheel drive systems such as those used on the [[Citro\u00ebn]] [[Citroen Traction Avant|Traction Avant]] and the front axles of [[Land Rover]] and similar four wheel drive vehicles used [[universal joint]]s, where a cross-shaped metal pivot sits between two forked carriers. These are not CV joints as, except for specific configurations, they result in a variation of the angular velocity. They are simple to make and can be tremendously strong and are still used to provide a flexible coupling in some propshafts, where there is not very much movement. However, they become \"notchy\" and difficult to turn when operated at extreme angles.\n\n== The first CV joints ==\nAs front wheel drive systems became more popular, with cars such as the [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]] [[Mini]] using compact transverse engine layouts, the shortcomings of universal joints in front axles became more and more apparent. Based on a design by [[Alfred H. Rzeppa]] which was filed for patent in 1927<ref name=patent>{{cite journal|url=http://v3.espacenet.com/origdoc?DB=EPODOC&IDX=US1665280&F=0&QPN=US1665280|author=Rzeppa, Alfred H.|title=Universal Joint|version=US patent no. 1,665,280|year=1927}}</ref> (a CV joint, the Tracta joint, designed by Pierre Fenaille at [[Jean-Albert Gr\u00e9goire]]'s [[Tracta]] company was filed for patent in 1926<ref>[http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=FR&NR=628309A&KC=A&FT=D&date=19271021&DB=EPODOC&locale=fr_V3 European Patent FR628309]</ref>), constant velocity joints solved many of these problems. They allowed a smooth transfer of power despite the wide range of angles through which they were bent.\n\n==Tracta joints==\n[[File:Tracta_Constant_Velocity_Joint.jpg|thumb|right|Tracta Joint]]\nThe Tracta joint works on the principle of the double [[tongue and groove]] joint. It comprises only four individual parts: the two forks (a.k.a. yokes, one driving and one driven) and the two semi-spherical sliding pieces (one called male or spigot swivel and another called female or slotted swivel) which interlock in a floating (movable) connection. Each yoke jaw engages a circular groove formed on the intermediate members. Both intermediate members are coupled together in turn by a swivel tongue and grooved joint. When the input and output shafts are inclined at some working angle to each other, the driving intermediate member accelerates and decelerates during each revolution. Since the central tongue and groove joint are a quarter of a revolution out of phase with the yoke jaws, the corresponding speed fluctuation of the driven intermediate and output jaw members exactly counteract and neutralize the speed variation of input half member. Thus the output speed change is identical to that of the input drive, providing constant velocity rotation.<ref>[http://what-when-how.com/automobile/universal-joints-automobile/ - Universal Joints (Automobile)]</ref><ref>[http://automotiveenginemechanics.tpub.com/TM-9-8000/TM-9-80000560.htm Tracta Constant Velocity Joint.]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GPdmft_cpKQC&pg=PA12&dq=tracta+joint&hl=en&sa=X&ei=jt5AT6-6I5SChQegivG1BQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=tracta%20joint&f=false Universal joints and driveshafts: analysis, design, applications]</ref>\n\n== Rzeppa joints ==\nA Rzeppa joint (invented by [[Alfred H. Rzeppa]] in 1926) consists of a spherical inner shell with 6 grooves in it and a similar enveloping outer shell. Each groove guides one ball. The input shaft fits in the centre of a large, steel, star-shaped \"gear\" that nests inside a circular cage. The cage is spherical but with ends open, and it typically has six openings around the perimeter. This cage and gear fit into a grooved cup that has a splined and threaded shaft attached to it. Six large steel balls sit inside the cup grooves and fit into the cage openings, nestled in the grooves of the star gear. The output shaft on the cup then runs through the wheel bearing and is secured by the axle nut. This joint can accommodate the large changes of angle when the front wheels are turned by the steering system; typical Rzeppa joints allow 45\u00b0\u201348\u00b0 of articulation, while some can give 54\u00b0.<ref>[http://www.ntn.co.jp/english/products/review/pdf/NTN_TR75_en_P016.pdf ntn.co.jp]</ref> At the \"outboard\" end of the driveshaft a slightly different unit is used. The end of the driveshaft is [[Rotating spline|splined]] and fits into the outer \"joint\". It is typically held in place by a [[circlip]].\n\n<gallery>\nGelenk-liegend.jpg|Spare rzeppa joint.\nGelenk-welle.jpg|Rzeppa joint compared to an [[1 euro coin]].\nCv joint large.png|Representation of a Rzeppa joint.\n</gallery>\n\n==Weiss joints==\nIt consists of two identical ball yokes which are positively located (usually) by four balls. The two joints are centered by means of a ball with a hole in the middle. Two balls in circular tracks transmit the torque while the other two preload the joint and ensure there is no backlash when the direction of loading changes.\n\nIts construction differs from that of the Rzeppa in that the balls are a tight fit between two halves of the coupling and that no cage is used. The center ball rotates on a pin inserted in the outer race and serves as a locking medium for the four other balls. When both shafts are in line, that is, at an angle of 180 degrees, the balls lie in a plane that is 90 degrees to the shafts. If the driving shaft remains in the original position, any movement of the driven shaft will cause the balls to move one half of the angular distance. For example, when the driven shaft moves through an angle of 20 degrees, the angle between the two shafts is reduced to 160 degrees. The balls will move 10 degrees in the same direction, and the angle between the driving shaft and the plane in which the balls lie will be reduced to 80 degrees. This action fulfills the requirement that the balls lie in the plane that bisects the angle of drive. This type of Weiss joint is known as the Bendix-Weiss joint.\n\nThe most advanced plunging joint which works on the Weiss principle is the six-ball star joint of Kurt Enke. This type uses only three balls to transmit the torque, while the remaining three center and hold it together. The balls are preloaded and the joint is completely encapsulated.\n<ref>[http://www.tpub.com/basae/119.htm www.tpub.com - Bendix-Weiss Constant Velocity (CV) Joint]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GPdmft_cpKQC&pg=PA19&dq=weiss+joint&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HNJAT5naN4OChQfSt_W6BQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=weiss%20joint&f=false Universal joints and driveshafts: analysis, design, applications]</ref>\n\n==Tripod joints==\nThese joints are used at the inboard end of car driveshafts. The joints were developed by Michel Orain, of Glaenzer Spicer of [[Poissy]], [[France]]. This joint has a three-pointed yoke attached to the shaft, which has barrel-shaped roller bearings on the ends. These fit into a cup with three matching grooves, attached to the [[Differential (mechanics)|differential]]. Since there is only significant movement in one axis, this simple arrangement works well. These also allow an axial 'plunge' movement of the shaft, so that engine rocking and other effects do not preload the bearings. A typical Tripod joint has up to 50&nbsp;mm of plunge travel, and 26 degrees of angular articulation.<ref>[http://www.gkndriveline.com/drivelinecms/export/sites/driveline/downloads/brochures/driveshafts_english.pdf GKN Driveline Driveshafts], [http://www.gkndriveline.com gkndriveline.com].</ref> The tripod joint does not have as much angular range as many of the other joint types, but tends to be lower in cost and more efficient. Due to this it is typically used in rear wheel drive vehicle configurations or on the inboard side of front wheel drive vehicles where the required range of motion is lower.\n\n==Double Cardan==\n[[Image:Double Cardan Joint (animated).gif|thumb|Double cardan joint]]\n\nDouble Cardan joints are similar to [[Universal joint#Double Cardan Shaft|double Cardan shafts]], except that the length of the intermediate shaft is shortened leaving only the yokes; this effectively allows the two Hooke's joints to be mounted back to back. DCJs are typically used in steering columns, as they eliminate the need to correctly phase the universal joints at the ends of the intermediate shaft (IS), which eases packaging of the IS around the other components in the engine bay of the car. They are also used to replace Rzeppa style constant-velocity joints in applications where high articulation angles, or impulsive torque loads are common, such as the driveshafts and halfshafts of rugged four wheel drive vehicles. Double Cardan joints require a centering element that will maintain equal angles between the driven and driving shafts for true constant velocity rotation.<ref name=\"US patent 1979768\">{{ cite patent\n | country = US\n\n | number = 1979768\n\n | status = patent\n\n | title = Double Universal Joint\n\n | pubdate =\n\n | gdate = 1934-11-06\n\n | fdate = 1933-07-24\n\n | pridate =\n\n | inventor = Pearce, John W.B.\n\n | invent1 =\n\n | invent2 =\n\n | assign1 =\n\n | assign2 =\n\n | class = 464/118; 403/136; 403/143; 464/905\n}}</ref><ref>[http://www.tpub.com/content/construction/14273/css/14273_181.htm Rzeppa Constant Velocity (CV) Joint<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This centering device requires additional torque to accelerate the internals of the joint and does generate some additional vibration at higher speeds.<ref name=\"US patent 2947158\">{{ cite patent\n | country = US\n\n | number = 2947158\n\n | status = patent\n\n | title = Universal Joint Centering Device\n\n | pubdate =\n\n | gdate = 1960-08-02\n\n | fdate = 1959-08-21\n\n | pridate =\n\n | inventor = King, Kenneth K.\n\n | invent1 =\n\n | invent2 =\n\n | assign1 = General Motors Corpororation\n\n | assign2 =\n\n | class = 464/118; 403/136; 403/143; 464/905\n\n | quote = The usual centering arrangement is a ball and socket type of construction... .

Note: drawing on the right omits certain components in order to illustrate the control yoke's spherical pantograph.]]\n\nThe Thompson constant velocity joint (TCVJ), also known as a Thompson coupling, assembles two cardan joints within each other to eliminate the intermediate shaft. A control yoke is added to keep the input and output shafts aligned. The control yoke uses a spherical [[pantograph]] [[scissor mechanism]] to bisect the angle between the input and output shafts and to maintain the joints at a relative phase angle of zero. The alignment ensures constant angular velocity at all joint angles. Eliminating the intermediate shaft and keeping the input shafts aligned in the homokinetic plane greatly reduces the induced [[shear stress]]es and [[vibration]] inherent in [[Universal_joint#Double Cardan Shaft|double cardan shafts]].<ref name = \"Sopanen\">{{cite web| url = http://www.ee.lut.fi/static/fi/lab/sahkokaytot/sameko/Cardan_Sameko.pdf | title = Studies on Torsion Vibration of a Double Cardan Joint Driveline| last = Sopanen | first = Jussi| year = 1996| accessdate = 2008-01-22 }}</ref><ref name = \"Sheu\">{{cite web | url = http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=3004428| title = Modelling and analysis of the Intermediate Shaft Between Two Universal Joints| last = Sheu| first = P| date = 2003-02-01| accessdate = 2008-01-22 }}</ref><ref name=\"tcvj in action video\">{{cite web|title=The Thompson Coupling Joint mechanism in action|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tmvBwVPcSs|publisher=Thompson Couplings|accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> While the geometric configuration does not maintain constant velocity for the control yoke that aligns the cardan joints, the control yoke has minimal inertia and generates little vibration.

The input shaft fits on the centre of a sphere with two rectangular grooves. To assemble it, the spherical driving ball is inserted in the cage by matching the two grooves with the narrowest part of the cage's mouth, rotated 90\u00b0. Then two steel blocks are inserted in the grooves and locked in place with a bolt running through the cage's side.\n\nThis joint was extensively tested for possible automotive application but proved to be unable to cope with the articulation needed for such a use. It was widely used in Italy in agriculture, as it was better suited than a Cardan joint to rotate at high speed and cheaper than a Rzeppa joint. By the early '90s, with the appearance on the market of Rzeppa joints produced in Asia, its production became uneconomic and it was discontinued.{{Commons category|Constant-velocity joints}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n[[Category:Rotating shaft couplings]]\n[[Category:Automotive transmission technologies]]"}]}}}}
