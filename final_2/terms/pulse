The pulse may be palpated in any place that allows an [[artery]] to be compressed against a [[bone]], such as at the [[neck]] ([[carotid artery]]), on the inside of the [[elbow]] ([[brachial artery]]), at the [[wrist]] ([[radial artery]]), at the [[groin]] ([[femoral artery]]), behind the [[knee]] ([[popliteal artery]]), near the [[ankle joint]] ([[posterior tibial artery]]), and on foot ([[dorsalis pedis artery]]). Pulse (or the count of arterial pulse per minute) is equivalent to measuring the heart rate. The heart rate can also be measured by listening to the heart beat directly ([[auscultation]]), traditionally using a [[stethoscope]] and counting it for a minute. The radial pulse is commonly measured using three fingers. This has a reason: the finger closest to the heart is used to occlude the pulse pressure, the middle finger is used get a crude estimate of the blood pressure, and the finger most distal to the heart (usually the ring finger)  is used to nullify the effect of the ulnar pulse as the two arteries are connected via the palmar arches ([[Superficial palmar arch|superficial]] and [[Deep palmar arch|deep]]). \nThe study of the pulse is known as sphygmology.\n\n== Physiology ==\nThe pulse is a decidedly low tech and high yield and antiquated term still useful at the bedside in an age of computational analysis of [[cardiac]] performance. Claudius [[Galen]] was perhaps the first [[physiologist]] to describe the pulse.<ref>Temkin 165;BBC[a]</ref>  The pulse is an expedient [[tactile]] method of determination of [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] [[blood pressure]] to a trained observer. [[Diastolic]] [[blood pressure]] is non-palpable and unobservable by tactile methods, occurring between heartbeats.\n\n[[Pressure wave]]s generated by the heart in [[Systole (medicine)|systole]] move the arterial walls. Forward movement of [[blood]] occurs when the boundaries are pliable and compliant. These properties form enough to create a palpable pressure wave.\n\nThe [[heart rate]] may be greater or lesser than the [[pulse rate]] depending upon physiologic demand. In this case, the heart rate is determined by [[auscultation]] or audible [[sounds]] at the heart apex, in which case it is not the pulse. The ''pulse deficit'' (difference between heart beats and pulsations at the periphery) is determined by simultaneous [[palpation]] at the [[radial artery]] and auscultation at the heart apex. It may be present in case of [[Premature ventricular contraction|premature beats]] or [[atrial fibrillation]].\n\nPulse velocity, pulse deficits and much more physiologic data are readily and simplistically visualized by the use of one or more [[arterial catheter]]s connected to a [[transducer]] and [[oscilloscope]]. This invasive technique has been commonly used in [[intensive care]] since the 1970s.\n\nThe rate of the pulse is observed and measured by tactile or visual means on the outside of an artery and is recorded as beats per minute or BPM.\n\nThe pulse may be further indirectly observed under [[light]] absorbances of varying wavelengths with assigned and inexpensively reproduced mathematical ratios. Applied capture of variances of light signal from the [[blood]] component [[hemoglobin]] under oxygenated vs. deoxygenated conditions allows the technology of [[pulse oximetry]].\n\n==Characteristics of pulse==\n\n===Rate===\nNormal pulse rates [[Heart rate#At rest|at rest]], in beats per minute (BPM):<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003399.htm U.S. Department of Health and Human Services - National Institutes of Health] Pulse</ref>\n{{listen |filename=Infant Heartbeat.ogg |title=Infant heartbeat |description=Infant heartbeat }}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! newborn<br>(0\u20133 months old)\n! infants<br>(3 \u2013 6 months)\n! infants<br>(6 \u2013 12 months)\n! children<br>(1 \u2013 10 years)\n! children over 10 years<br>& adults, including seniors\n! well-trained<br>adult athletes\n\n|-\n|100-150\n|90\u2013120\n|80-120\n|70\u2013130\n|60\u2013100\n|40\u201360\n|}\n\nThe pulse rate can be used to check overall heart health and fitness level. Generally lower is better, but [[bradycardia]]s can be dangerous. Symptoms of a dangerously slow heartbeat include weakness, loss of energy and fainting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pulse Rate Measurement|url=http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/pulse-measurement|work=Healthwise|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Rhythm===\nA normal pulse is regular in rhythm and force. An irregular pulse may be due to [[sinus arrhythmia]], [[ectopic beats]], [[atrial fibrillation]], [[Paroxysmal Atrial Tachycardia|paroxysmal atrial tachycardia]], [[atrial flutter]], [[Second-degree atrioventricular block|partial heart block]] etc. Intermittent dropping out of beats at pulse is called \"intermittent pulse\". Examples of ''regular'' intermittent (regularly irregular) pulse include [[pulsus bigeminus]], [[second-degree atrioventricular block]]. An example of ''irregular'' intermittent (irregularly irregular) pulse is [[atrial fibrillation]].\n\n===Volume===\nThe degree of expansion displayed by artery during diastolic and systolic state is called volume. It is also known as amplitude, expansion or size of pulse.\n\n====Hypokinetic pulse====\nA weak pulse signifies narrow [[pulse pressure]]. It may be due to low [[cardiac output]] (as seen in [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], [[congestive cardiac failure]]), [[hypovolemia]], [[valvular heart disease]] (such as [[aortic stenosis|aortic outflow tract obstruction]], [[mitral stenosis]], [[aortic arch syndrome]]) etc.\n\n====Hyperkinetic pulse====\nA bounding pulse signifies high pulse pressure. It may be due to low [[peripheral resistance]] (as seen in [[fever]], [[anemia]], [[thyrotoxicosis]], {{Interlanguage link multi|hyperkinetic heart syndrome|de|3=hyperkinetisches Herzsyndrom}}, [[Arteriovenous fistula|A-V fistula]], [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]], [[beriberi]], [[liver cirrhosis]]), increased cardiac output, increased [[stroke volume]] (as seen in anxiety, exercise, [[complete heart block]], [[aortic regurgitation]]), decreased distensibility of arterial system (as seen in [[atherosclerosis]], [[hypertension]] and [[coarctation of aorta]]).\n\nThe strength of the pulse can also be reported:<ref name=\"urlwww.meddean.luc.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/Medicine/pulmonar/pd/step5b.htm |title=www.meddean.luc.edu |work=|accessdate=2009-05-20}}</ref><ref name=\"urlVascular Surgery, University of Kansas School of Medicine\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kumc.edu/vsurg/eval.htm |title=Vascular Surgery, University of Kansas School of Medicine |work=|accessdate=2009-05-20}}</ref>\n* 0 = Absent\n* 1 = Barely palpable\n* 2 = Easily palpable\n* 3 = Full\n* 4 = Aneurysmal or [[bounding pulse]]\n\n===Force===\nAlso known as compressibility of pulse. It is a rough measure of [[systolic blood pressure]].\n\n===Tension===\nIt corresponds to [[diastolic blood pressure]]. A low tension pulse (pulsus mollis), the vessel is soft or impalpable between beats. In high tension pulse (pulsus durus), vessels feels rigid even between pulse beats.\n\n===Form===\nA form or contour of a pulse is palpatiory estimation of [[arteriogram]]. A quickly rising and quickly falling pulse (pulsus celer) is seen in aortic regurgitation. A slow rising and slowly falling pulse (pulsus tardus) is seen in aortic stenosis.\n\n===Equality===\nComparing pulses and different places gives valuable clinical information.\n\nA discrepant or unequal pulse between left and right radial artery is observed in anomalous or aberrant course of artery, coarctation of aorta, [[aortitis]], [[dissecting aneurysm]], [[peripheral embolism]] etc. An unequal pulse between upper and lower extremities is seen in coarctation to aorta, aortitis, block at [[Aortic bifurcation|bifurcation of aorta]], [[dissection of aorta]], [[iatrogenic]] trauma and [[arteriosclerotic]] obstruction.\n\n===Condition of arterial wall===\nA normal artery is not palpable after flattening by [[Finger|digital]] pressure. A thick radial artery which is palpable 7.5\u201310&nbsp;cm up the forearm is suggestive of arteriosclerosis.\n\n===Radio-femoral delay===\nIn coarctation of aorta, femoral pulse may be significantly delayed as compared to radial pulse (unless there is coexisting aortic regurgitation). The delay can also be observed in [[supravalvar aortic stenosis]].\n\n==Patterns==\nSeveral pulse patterns can be of clinically significance. These include:\n* [[Pulsus alternans]]: an ominous medical sign that indicates progressive systolic heart failure. To trained fingertips, the examiner notes a pattern of a strong pulse followed by a weak pulse over and over again. This pulse signals a flagging effort of the heart to sustain itself in systole.\n* [[Pulsus bigeminus]]: indicates a pair of hoofbeats within each heartbeat. Concurrent [[auscultation]] of the heart may reveal a [[gallop rhythm]] of the native heartbeat.\n* [[Pulsus bisferiens]]: an unusual physical finding typically seen in patients with aortic valve diseases. If the aortic valve does not normally open and close, trained fingertips will observe two pulses to each heartbeat instead of one.\n* [[Pulsus tardus et parvus]] (or anacrotic pulse): a slower than normal rise in the tactile pulse caused by an increasingly stiff aortic valve. Loss of compliance in the aortic valve makes it progressively harder to open, thus requiring increased generation of blood pressure in the left ventricle.\n* [[Pulsus paradoxus]]: a condition in which some heartbeats cannot be detected at the radial artery during the inspiration phase of respiration. It is caused by an exaggerated decrease in blood pressure during this phase, and is diagnostic of a variety of cardiac and respiratory conditions of varying urgency.\n* [[Tachycardia]]: an elevated resting heart rate. In general an [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) is required to identify the type of tachycardia.\n* [[Pulsatile]] This description of the pulse implies the intrinsic physiology of [[Systole (medicine)|systole]] and [[diastole]]. Scientifically, systole and diastole are [[force]]s that expand and contract the pulmonary and systemic circulations.\n*A collapsing pulse is a sign of [[hyperdynamic circulation]].\n\n== Common palpable sites ==\n{{anchor|Sites|Pulse sites}}\n\n===Upper limb===\n[[Image:Gray1235.png|thumb|Front of right upper extremity]]\n*'''Axillary pulse''': located inferiorly of the lateral wall of the [[axilla]]\n*'''Brachial pulse''': located on the inside of the upper arm near the elbow, frequently used in place of carotid pulse in infants ([[brachial artery]])\n*'''[[Radial pulse]]''': located on the lateral of the wrist ([[radial artery]]).   It can also be found in the [[anatomical snuff box]].\n*'''Ulnar pulse''': located on the medial of the wrist ([[ulnar artery]]).\n[[Culture of China|Chinese]] medicine has focused on the pulse in the upper limbs for several centuries. The concept of [[pulse diagnosis]] is essentially a treatise based upon palpation and observations of the radial and ulnar volar pulses at the readily accessible wrist.\n\n===Lower limb===\n*'''[[Femoral pulse]]''': located in the inner thigh, at the mid-inguinal point, halfway between the pubic symphysis and anterior superior iliac spine ([[femoral artery]]).\n*'''Popliteal pulse''': Above the knee in the popliteal fossa, found by holding the bent knee. The patient bends the knee at approximately 124\u00b0, and the physician holds it in both hands to find the popliteal artery in the pit behind the knee ([[Popliteal artery]]).\n*'''Dorsalis pedis pulse''': located on top of the foot, immediately lateral to the extensor of hallucis longus ([[dorsalis pedis artery]]).\n*'''Tibialis posterior pulse''': located on the medial side of the ankle, 2&nbsp;cm inferior and 2&nbsp;cm posterior to the medial malleolus ([[posterior tibial artery]]). It is easily palpable over [[Pimenta's Point]].\n\n===Head and neck===\n[[Image:Gray513.png|thumb|Arteries of the neck.]]\n*'''[[Carotid pulse]]''': located in the neck ([[carotid artery]]). The carotid artery should be palpated gently and while the patient is sitting or lying down. Stimulating its baroreceptors with low palpitation can provoke severe [[bradycardia]] or even stop the heart in some sensitive persons. Also, a person's two carotid arteries should not be palpated at the same time. Doing so may limit the flow of blood to the head, possibly leading to [[fainting]] or brain [[ischemia]].  It can be felt between the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, above the hyoid bone and lateral to the thyroid cartilage.\n*'''Facial pulse''': located on the mandible (lower jawbone) on a line with the corners of the mouth ([[facial artery]]).\n*'''Temporal pulse''': located on the [[Temple (anatomy)|temple]] directly in front of the ear ([[superficial temporal artery]]).\n\n===Torso===\n*'''Apical pulse''': located in the 5th left intercostal space, 1.25&nbsp;cm lateral to the [[mid-clavicular line]]. In contrast with other pulse sites, the apical pulse site is unilateral, and measured not under an artery, but below the [[heart]] itself (more specifically, the apex of the heart). See also [[apex beat]].\n\n==History==\nThe first person to accurately measure the pulse rate was [[Santorio Santorii]] who invented the ''pulsilogium'', a form of [[pendulum]], based on the work by [[Galileo Galilei]]. A century later another physician, [[Fran\u00e7ois Boissier de Sauvages de Lacroix|de Lacroix]], used the pulsilogium to test cardiac function.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Heart rate]]\n*[[Pulse meter]]\n*[[Tempo]]\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Pulse}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Medical records}}\n{{Cardiovascular physiology}}\n{{Cardiovascular system symptoms and signs}}\n\n[[Category:Cardiovascular physiology]]\n[[Category:Mathematics in medicine]]"}]}}}}
