The velocity then is distinct from the instantaneous [[speed]] which is the [[time rate]] of change of the distance traveled along a specific path. The velocity may be equivalently defined as the time rate of change of the position vector. If one considers a moving initial position, or equivalently a moving origin (e.g. an initial position or origin which is fixed to a train wagon, which in turn moves with respect to its rail track), the velocity of P (e.g. a point representing the position of a passenger walking on the train) may be referred to as a relative velocity, as opposed to an absolute velocity, which is computed with respect to a point which is considered to be 'fixed in space' (such as, for instance, a point fixed on the floor of the train station).\n\nFor motion over a given interval of time, the displacement divided by the length of the time interval defines the average velocity. (Note that the average [[velocity]], as a vector, differs from the [[average speed]] that is the ratio of the path length&#8202;\u2014&#8202;a scalar&#8202;\u2014&#8202;and the time interval.)\n\n== Rigid body ==\nIn dealing with the motion of a [[rigid body]], the term ''displacement'' may also include the [[rotation]]s of the body. In this case, the displacement of a particle of the body is called '''linear displacement''' (displacement along a line), while the rotation of the body is called '''[[angular displacement]]'''.\n\n== Derivatives ==\nFor a position vector '''''s''''' that is a function of time ''t'', the derivatives can be computed with respect to ''t''.  These derivatives have common utility in the study of [[kinematics]], [[control theory]], [[vibration sensor|vibration sensing]] and other sciences and engineering disciplines.\n  \n[[Velocity]]\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{v}=\\frac{\\text{d}\\boldsymbol{s}}{\\text{d}t}</math> (where d'''''s''''' is an [[Differential (infinitesimal)|infinitesimally]] small displacement)\n\n[[Acceleration]]\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{a}=\\frac{\\text{d}\\boldsymbol{v}}{\\text{d}t}=\\frac{\\text{d}^2\\boldsymbol{s}}{\\text{d}t^2}</math>\n\n[[Jerk (physics)|Jerk]]\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{j}=\\frac{\\text{d}\\boldsymbol{a}}{\\text{d}t}=\\frac{\\text{d}^2\\boldsymbol{v}}{\\text{d}t^2}=\\frac{\\text{d}^3\\boldsymbol{s}}{\\text{d}t^3}</math>\n\nThese common names correspond to terminology used in basic kinematics.<ref name='stewart'>{{cite book\n|last= Stewart\n|first= James\n|authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician)\n|title= [[Calculus]]\n|publisher= Brooks/Cole\n|year= 2001\n|edition= 2nd\n|isbn= 0-534-37718-1\n|chapter= \u00a72.8 - The Derivative As A Function\n}}\n</ref>  By extension, the higher order derivatives can be computed in a similar fashion.  Study of these higher order derivatives can improve approximations of the original displacement function.  Such higher-order terms are required in order to accurately represent the displacement function as [[Taylor series|a sum of an infinite series]], enabling several analytical techniques in engineering and physics. The fourth order derivative is called [[jounce]], the fifth [[Crackle_(physics)|crackle]], and the sixth [[Pop_(physics)|pop]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Equipollence (geometry)]]\n* [[Position vector]]\n* [[Affine space]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Kinematics}}\n{{Classical mechanics derived SI units}}\n\n[[Category:Motion (physics)]]\n[[Category:Length]]\n\n[[Category:Vectors (mathematics and physics)]]"}]}}}}
