The filament may be bare, or more commonly (as shown here), embedded within and insulated from an enclosing cathode.]]\n\nIn [[electronics]], a '''diode''' is a two-[[Terminal (electronics)|terminal]] [[electronic component]] that conducts primarily in one direction (asymmetric [[electrical conductance|conductance]]); it has low (ideally zero) [[electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] to the flow of [[Electric current|current]] in one direction, and high (ideally [[Infinity|infinite]]) resistance in the other. A '''semiconductor diode''', the most common type today, is a [[Crystallinity|crystalline]] piece of [[semiconductor]] material with a [[p\u2013n junction]] connected to two electrical terminals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.element-14.com/community/docs/DOC-22519/l/physical-explanation--general-semiconductors |title=Physical Explanation \u2013 General Semiconductors |date=2010-05-25 |accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref> A [[vacuum tube]] diode has two [[electrode]]s, a [[Plate electrode|plate]] (anode) and a [[hot cathode|heated cathode]]. Semiconductor diodes were the first [[Semiconductor device|semiconductor electronic devices]]. The discovery of [[crystal]]s' [[Rectification (electricity)|rectifying]] abilities was made by German physicist [[Ferdinand Braun]] in 1874. The first semiconductor diodes, called [[cat's whisker diode]]s, developed around 1906, were made of mineral crystals such as [[galena]]. Today, most diodes are made of [[silicon]], but other semiconductors such as [[selenium]] or  [[germanium]] are sometimes used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.element-14.com/community/docs/DOC-22518/l/the-constituents-of-semiconductor-components |title=The Constituents of Semiconductor Components |date=2010-05-25 |accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref>\n\n==Main functions==\nThe most common function of a diode is to allow an electric current to pass in one direction (called the diode's ''forward'' direction), while blocking current in the opposite direction (the ''reverse'' direction). Thus, the diode can be viewed as an electronic version of a [[check valve]]. This unidirectional behavior is called [[rectification (electricity)|rectification]], and is used to convert [[alternating current]] (AC) to [[direct current]] (DC), including extraction of [[modulation]] from radio signals in radio receivers\u2014these diodes are forms of [[rectifier]]s.\n\nHowever, diodes can have more complicated behavior than this simple on\u2013off action, because of their [[linear circuit|nonlinear]] current-voltage characteristics.  Semiconductor diodes begin conducting electricity only if a certain threshold voltage or cut-in voltage is present in the forward direction (a state in which the diode is said to be ''[[p\u2013n junction#Forward bias|forward-biased]]''). The voltage drop across a forward-biased diode varies only a little with the current, and is a function of temperature; this effect can be used as a [[#Temperature measurements|temperature sensor]] or as a [[voltage reference]].\n\nA semiconductor diode's current\u2013voltage characteristic can be tailored by selecting the [[semiconductor materials]] and the [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] impurities introduced into the materials during manufacture. These techniques are used to create special-purpose diodes that perform many different functions.  For example, diodes are used to regulate voltage ([[Zener diode]]s), to protect circuits from high voltage surges ([[avalanche diode]]s), to electronically tune radio and TV receivers ([[varactor diode]]s), to generate [[radio frequency|radio-frequency]] [[oscillation]]s ([[tunnel diode]]s, [[Gunn diode]]s, [[IMPATT diode]]s), and to produce light ([[light-emitting diode]]s). Tunnel, Gunn and IMPATT diodes exhibit [[negative resistance]], which is useful in [[microwave]] and switching circuits.\n\nDiodes, both vacuum and semiconductor, can be used as [[Noise generator#Shot noise generators|shot-noise generators]].\n\n==History==\nThermionic ([[vacuum tube]]) diodes and [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] (semiconductor) diodes were developed separately, at approximately the same time, in the early 1900s, as radio receiver [[detector (radio)|detector]]s.  Until the 1950s [[vacuum tube]] diodes were used more frequently in radios because the early point-contact type semiconductor diodes were less stable. In addition, most receiving sets had vacuum tubes for amplification that could easily have the thermionic diodes included in the tube (for example the [[12SQ7]] [[double diode triode]]), and vacuum tube rectifiers and gas-filled rectifiers were capable of handling some high voltage/high current rectification tasks better than the semiconductor diodes (such as [[metal rectifier|selenium rectifiers]]) which were available at that time.\n\n===Vacuum tube diodes===\n{{further2|[[Vacuum tube#History and development|Vacuum tube]]}}\nIn 1873, [[Frederick Guthrie]] discovered the basic principle of operation of thermionic diodes.<ref>Guthrie, Frederick (October 1873) [https://books.google.com/books?id=U08wAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA257 \"On a relation between heat and static electricity,\"] ''The London, Edinburgh and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science'', 4th series, '''46''' :  257\u2013266.</ref><ref>[http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1928/richardson-lecture.pdf 1928 Nobel Lecture:] Owen W.

The same did not apply to a negatively charged electroscope, indicating that the current flow was only possible in one direction.\n\n[[Thomas Edison]] independently rediscovered the principle on February 13, 1880{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}. At the time, Edison was investigating why the filaments of his carbon-filament light bulbs nearly always burned out at the positive-connected end. He had a special bulb made with a metal plate sealed into the glass envelope. Using this device, he confirmed that an invisible current flowed from the glowing filament through the [[vacuum]] to the metal plate, but only when the plate was connected to the positive supply.\n\nEdison devised a circuit where his modified light bulb effectively replaced the resistor in a [[direct current|DC]] [[voltmeter]]. Edison was awarded a patent for this invention in 1884.<ref>Edison, Thomas A. \"Electrical Meter\" {{US patent|307030}} Issue date: Oct 21, 1884</ref> Since there was no apparent practical use for such a device at the time, the patent application was most likely simply a precaution in case someone else did find a use for the so-called [[Edison effect]].\n\nAbout 20 years later, [[John Ambrose Fleming]] (scientific adviser to the [[Marconi Company]]\nand former Edison employee) realized that the Edison effect could be used as a precision [[Detector (radio)|radio detector]].

Other substances offered slightly better performance, but galena was most widely used because it had the advantage of being cheap and easy to obtain. The crystal detector in these early [[crystal radio]] sets consisted of an adjustable wire point-contact, often made of gold or platinum because of their incorrodible nature (the so-called \"cat's whisker\"), which could be manually moved over the face of the crystal in search of a portion of that mineral with rectifying qualties. This troublesome device was superseded by thermionic diodes ([[vacuum tubes]]) by the 1920s, but after high purity semiconductor materials became available, the crystal detector returned to dominant use with the advent, in the 1950s, of inexpensive fixed-[[germanium]] diodes. [[Bell Labs]] also developed a germanium diode for microwave reception, and AT&T used these in their microwave towers that criss-crossed the nation starting in the late 1940s, carrying telephone and network television signals. [[Bell Labs]] did not develop a satisfactory thermionic diode for microwave reception.\n\n===Etymology===\nAt the time of their invention, such devices were known as [[rectifier]]s. In 1919, the year [[tetrode]]s were invented, [[William Henry Eccles]] coined the term '''''diode''''' from the [[Greek and Latin roots|Greek roots]] ''di'' (from ''\u03b4\u03af''), meaning 'two', and ''ode'' (from ''\u1f41\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2''), meaning 'path'. (However, the word ''diode'' itself, as well as ''[[triode]], [[tetrode]], [[pentode]], [[hexode]]'', were already in use as terms of [[Time-division multiplexing|multiplex]] [[telegraphy]]; see, for example, ''The telegraphic journal and electrical review'', September 10, 1886, p.&nbsp;252).\n\n====Rectifiers====\n{{Main|Rectifier}}\nAlthough all diodes ''rectify'', the term '[[rectifier]]' is normally reserved for higher currents and voltages than would normally be found in the rectification of lower power [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signals]]; examples include: \n* [[Power supply]] rectifiers (''[[Half-wave rectifier#Half-wave rectification|half-wave]]'', ''full-wave'', ''[[Bridge rectifiers|bridge]]'')\n* [[Flyback diode]]s\n\n===World's smallest diode===\nResearchers from the University of Georgia and Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU) have developed a diode made from a molecule of DNA.  Professor Bingqian Xu from the College of Engineering at the University of Georgia and his team took a single DNA molecule made from 11 base pairs and connected it to an electronic circuit a few nanometers in size. When layers of [[coralyne]] were inserted between layers of DNA, the current jumped up to 15 times larger negative versus positive, which is necessary for a nano diode.<ref>Choi, Charles Q.

''IHS Electronics360''</ref>\n\n==Thermionic diodes==\n[[File:Diode-english-text.svg|thumb|left|Diode vacuum tube construction]]\n[[File:Vacuum diode.svg|thumb|110px|right|The symbol for an indirect heated vacuum-tube diode. From top to bottom, the components are the anode, the cathode, and the heater filament.]]\n\nA thermionic diode is a [[thermionic valve|thermionic-valve]] device (also known as a [[vacuum tube]], tube, or valve), consisting of a sealed evacuated glass envelope containing two [[electrode]]s: a [[thermionic cathode|cathode]] heated by a [[electrical filament|filament]], and a [[plate electrode|plate]] ([[anode]]). Early examples were fairly similar in appearance to [[incandescent light bulb]]s.\n\nIn operation, a separate current through the filament (heater), a high resistance wire made of [[nichrome]], heats the cathode red hot (800\u20131000&nbsp;\u00b0C), causing it to release [[electron]]s into the vacuum, a process called [[thermionic emission]].  The cathode is coated with [[oxide]]s of [[alkaline earth metal]]s such as [[barium]] and [[strontium]] [[oxide]]s, which have a low [[work function]], to increase the number of electrons emitted. (Some valves use ''direct heating'', in which a tungsten filament acts as both heater and cathode.)  The alternating voltage to be rectified is applied between the cathode and the concentric plate electrode.  When the plate has a positive voltage with respect to the cathode, it [[electrostatics|electrostatically]] attracts the electrons from the cathode, so a current of electrons flows through the tube from cathode to plate.  However, when the polarity is reversed and the plate has a negative voltage, no current flows, because the cathode electrons are not attracted to it.  The unheated plate does not emit any electrons itself.  So electrons can only flow through the tube in one direction, from the cathode to the anode plate.\n\nIn a [[mercury-arc valve]], an arc forms between a refractory conductive anode and a pool of liquid mercury acting as cathode. Such units were made with ratings up to hundreds of kilowatts, and were important in the development of [[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] power transmission. Some types of smaller thermionic rectifiers had mercury vapor fill to reduce their forward voltage drop and to increase current rating over thermionic hard-vacuum devices.\n\nThroughout the vacuum tube era, valve diodes were used in analog signal applications and as rectifiers in DC power supplies in consumer electronics such as radios, televisions, and sound systems.  They were replaced in power supplies beginning in the 1940s by [[selenium rectifier]]s and then by semiconductor diodes by the 1960s. Today they are still used in a few high power applications where their ability to withstand transient voltages and their robustness gives them an advantage over semiconductor devices. The recent (2012) resurgence of interest among [[audiophile]]s and recording studios in old valve audio gear such as [[guitar amplifier]]s and home audio systems has provided a market for the legacy consumer diode valves.\n\n==Semiconductor diodes==<!-- This section is linked from [[Boltzmann constant]] -->\n\n===Electronic symbols===\n{{Main|Electronic symbol}}\n\nThe symbol used for a semiconductor diode in a [[circuit diagram]] specifies the type of diode.  There are alternative symbols for some types of diodes, though the differences are minor.

A pointed metal wire is placed in contact with an n-type semiconductor. Some metal migrates into the semiconductor to make a small p-type region around the contact. The 1N34 germanium version is still used in radio receivers as a detector and occasionally in specialized analog electronics.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Junction diodes===\n\n====p\u2013n junction diode====\n{{main|p\u2013n diode}}\nA p\u2013n junction diode is made of a crystal of [[semiconductor]], usually silicon, but [[germanium]] and [[gallium arsenide]] are also used. Impurities are added to it to create a region on one side that contains negative [[charge carrier]]s (electrons), called an [[n-type semiconductor]], and a region on the other side that contains positive charge carriers ([[Electron hole|holes]]), called a [[p-type semiconductor]]. When the n-type and p-type materials are attached together, a momentary flow of electrons occur from the n to the p side resulting in a third region between the two where no charge carriers are present. This region is called the [[depletion region]] because there are no charge carriers (neither electrons nor holes) in it. The diode's terminals are attached to the n-type and p-regions. The boundary between these two regions, called a [[p\u2013n junction]], is where the action of the diode takes place. When a sufficiently higher electrical potential is applied to the P side (the [[anode]]) than to the N side (the [[cathode]]), it allows electrons to flow through the depletion region from the N-type side to the P-type side. The junction does not allow the flow of electrons in the opposite direction when the potential is applied in reverse, creating, in a sense, an electrical [[check valve]].\n\n====Schottky diode====\n{{main|Schottky diode}}\nAnother type of junction diode, the [[Schottky diode]], is formed from a [[metal\u2013semiconductor junction]] rather than a p\u2013n junction, which reduces capacitance and increases switching speed.\n\n===Current\u2013voltage characteristic===\n[[File:Diode current wiki.png|thumb|400px|I\u2013V (current vs. voltage) characteristics of a p\u2013n junction diode]]\n\nA semiconductor diode's behavior in a circuit is given by its [[current\u2013voltage characteristic]], or I\u2013V graph (see graph below). The shape of the curve is determined by the transport of charge carriers through the so-called ''[[depletion zone|depletion layer]]'' or ''[[depletion region]]'' that exists at the [[p\u2013n junction]] between differing semiconductors. When a p\u2013n junction is first created, conduction-band (mobile) electrons from the N-[[dopant|doped]] region diffuse into the P-[[dopant|doped]] region where there is a large population of holes (vacant places for electrons) with which the electrons \"recombine\". When a mobile electron recombines with a hole, both hole and electron vanish, leaving behind an immobile positively charged donor (dopant) on the N side and negatively charged acceptor (dopant) on the P side. The region around the p\u2013n junction becomes depleted of [[charge carrier]]s and thus behaves as an [[nonconductor|insulator]].\n\nHowever, the width of the depletion region (called the [[depletion width]]) cannot grow without limit. For each [[electron\u2013hole pair]] recombination made, a positively charged [[dopant]] ion is left behind in the N-doped region, and a negatively charged dopant ion is created in the P-doped region. As recombination proceeds and more ions are created, an increasing electric field develops through the depletion zone that acts to slow and then finally stop recombination. At this point, there is a \"built-in\" potential across the depletion zone.\n\n[[File:PN band.gif|thumb|600px|right|A [[PN junction]] [[diode]] in forward bias mode, the [[depletion width]] decreases. Both p and n junctions are doped at a 1e15/cm3 [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] level, leading to built-in [[potential]] of ~0.59V. Observe the different [[Quasi Fermi level]]s for conduction band and valence band in n and p regions (red curves).]]\n====Reverse bias====\nIf an external voltage is placed across the diode with the same polarity as the built-in potential, the depletion zone continues to act as an insulator, preventing any significant electric current flow (unless [[electron\u2013hole pair]]s are actively being created in the junction by, for instance, light; see [[photodiode]]). This is called the ''[[reverse bias]]'' phenomenon. \n====Forward bias====\nHowever, if the polarity of the external voltage opposes the built-in potential, recombination can once again proceed, resulting in a substantial electric current through the p\u2013n junction (i.e. substantial numbers of electrons and holes recombine at the junction). For silicon diodes, the built-in potential is approximately 0.7 V (0.3 V for germanium and 0.2 V for Schottky). Thus, if an external voltage greater than and opposite to the built-in voltage is applied, a current will flow and the diode is said to be \"turned on\" as it has been given an external ''[[p\u2013n junction#Forward bias|forward bias]]''. The diode is commonly said to have a forward \"threshold\" voltage, above which it conducts and below which conduction stops. However, this is only an approximation as the forward characteristic is according to the Shockley equation absolutely smooth (see graph below).{{clarify|date=August 2015}}\n\nA diode's [[I\u2013V characteristic]] can be approximated by four regions of operation:\n\n# At very large reverse bias, beyond the [[peak inverse voltage]] or PIV, a process called reverse [[avalanche breakdown|breakdown]] occurs that causes a large increase in current (i.e., a large number of electrons and holes are created at, and move away from the p\u2013n junction) that usually damages the device permanently. The [[avalanche diode]] is deliberately designed for use in that manner. In the [[Zener diode]], the concept of PIV is not applicable. A Zener diode contains a heavily doped p\u2013n junction allowing electrons to tunnel from the valence band of the p-type material to the conduction band of the n-type material, such that the reverse voltage is \"clamped\" to a known value (called the ''Zener voltage''), and avalanche does not occur. Both devices, however, do have a limit to the maximum current and power they can withstand in the clamped reverse-voltage region. Also, following the end of forward conduction in any diode, there is reverse current for a short time. The device does not attain its full blocking capability until the reverse current ceases.\n# For a bias less than the PIV, the reverse current is very small. For a normal P\u2013N rectifier diode, the reverse current through the device in the micro-ampere (\u00b5A) range is very low. However, this is temperature dependent, and at sufficiently high temperatures, a substantial amount of reverse current can be observed (mA or more).\n# With a small forward bias, where only a small forward current is conducted, the current\u2013voltage curve is [[Exponential function|exponential]] in accordance with the ideal diode equation.  There is a definite forward voltage at which the diode starts to conduct significantly.  This is called the ''knee voltage'' or ''cut-in voltage'' and is equal to the [[p\u2013n junction#Properties of a p\u2013n junction|barrier potential]] of the p-n junction. This is a feature of the exponential curve, and appears sharper on a current scale more compressed than in the diagram shown here.\n# At larger forward currents the current-voltage curve starts to be dominated by the ohmic resistance of the bulk semiconductor.  The curve is no longer exponential, it is asymptotic to a straight line whose slope is the bulk resistance.  This region is particularly important for power diodes.  The diode can be modeled as an ideal diode in series with a fixed resistor.\n\nIn a small silicon diode operating at its rated currents, the voltage drop is about 0.6 to 0.7 [[volt]]s. The value is different for other diode types\u2014[[Schottky diode]]s can be rated as low as 0.2 V, germanium diodes 0.25 to 0.3 V, and red or blue [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) can have values of 1.4 V and 4.0 V respectively.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nAt higher currents the forward voltage drop of the diode increases. A drop of 1 V to 1.5 V is typical at full rated current for power diodes.\n\n===Shockley diode equation===\n{{main|Shockley diode equation}}\nThe ''Shockley ideal diode equation'' or the ''diode law'' (named after [[transistor]] co-inventor [[William Shockley|William Bradford Shockley]]) gives the I\u2013V characteristic of an ideal diode in either forward or reverse bias (or no bias). The following equation is called the ''Shockley ideal diode equation'' when ''n'', the ideality factor, is set equal to 1 :\n\n:<math>I=I_\\mathrm{S} \\left( e^\\frac{V_\\text{D}}{n V_\\text{T}} - 1 \\right)</math>\n\nwhere\n:''I'' is the diode current,\n:''I''<sub>S</sub> is the reverse bias [[saturation current]] (or scale current),\n:''V''<sub>D</sub> is the voltage across the diode,\n:''V''<sub>T</sub> is the [[thermal voltage]], and\n:''n'' is the ''ideality factor'', also known as the ''quality factor'' or sometimes ''emission coefficient''. The ideality factor ''n'' typically varies from 1 to 2 (though can in some cases be higher), depending on the fabrication process and semiconductor material and is set equal to 1 for the case of an \"ideal\" diode (thus the n is sometimes omitted). The ideality factor was added to account for imperfect junctions as observed in real transistors. The factor mainly accounts for [[carrier recombination]] as the charge carriers cross the [[depletion region]].\n\nThe [[thermal voltage]] ''V''<sub>T</sub> is approximately 25.85 mV at 300 K, a temperature close to \"room temperature\" commonly used in device simulation software. At any temperature it is a known constant defined by:\n\n:<math>V_\\text{T} = \\frac{k T}{q} \\, ,</math>\n\nwhere ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]], ''T'' is the absolute temperature of the p\u2013n junction, and ''q'' is the magnitude of charge of an [[electron]] (the [[elementary charge]]).\n\nThe reverse saturation current, ''I''<sub>S</sub>, is not constant for a given device, but varies with temperature; usually more significantly than ''V''<sub>T</sub>, so that ''V''<sub>D</sub> typically decreases as ''T'' increases.\n\nThe ''Shockley ideal diode equation'' or the ''diode law'' is derived with the assumption that the only processes giving rise to the current in the diode are drift (due to electrical field), diffusion, and thermal [[carrier generation and recombination|recombination\u2013generation]] (R\u2013G) (this equation is derived by setting n = 1 above). It also assumes that the R\u2013G current in the depletion region is insignificant. This means that the ''Shockley ideal diode equation'' doesn't account for the processes involved in reverse breakdown and photon-assisted R\u2013G. Additionally, it doesn't describe the \"leveling off\" of the I\u2013V curve at high forward bias due to internal resistance. Introducing the ideality factor, n, accounts for recombination and generation of carriers.\n\nUnder ''reverse bias'' voltages the exponential in the diode equation is negligible, and the current is a constant (negative) reverse current value of \u2212''I<sub>S</sub>''. The reverse ''breakdown region'' is not modeled by the Shockley diode equation.\n\nFor even rather small ''forward bias'' voltages the exponential is very large, since the thermal voltage is very small in comparison. The subtracted '1' in the diode equation is then negligible and the forward diode current can be approximated by\n\n:<math>I = I_\\text{S} e^\\frac{V_\\text{D}}{n V_\\text{T}}</math>\n\nThe use of the diode equation in circuit problems is illustrated in the article on [[diode modelling#Shockley diode model|diode modeling]].\n\n===Small-signal behavior===\nFor circuit design, a small-signal model of the diode behavior often proves useful. A specific example of diode modeling is discussed in the article on [[small-signal model|small-signal circuits]].\n\n===Reverse-recovery effect===\nFollowing the end of forward conduction in a p\u2013n type diode, a reverse current can flow for a short time. The device does not attain its blocking capability until the mobile charge in the junction is depleted.\n\nThe effect can be significant when switching large currents very quickly.<ref>[http://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen5817/hw/hw1/Diode%20reverse%20recovery%20in%20a%20boost%20converter.pdf Diode reverse recovery in a boost converter]. ECEN5817. ecee.colorado.edu</ref> A certain amount of \"reverse recovery time\" t<sub>r</sub> (on the order of tens of nanoseconds to a few microseconds) may be required to remove the reverse recovery charge Q<sub>r</sub> from the diode. During this recovery time, the diode can actually conduct in the reverse direction. This might give rise to a large constant current in the reverse direction for a short time while the diode is reverse biased. The magnitude of such a reverse current is determined by the operating circuit (i.e., the series resistance) and the diode is said to be in the storage-phase.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1109/LED.2014.2353301| title = Gate-Controlled Reverse Recovery for Characterization of LDMOS Body Diode| journal = IEEE Electron Device Letters| volume = 35| issue = 11| page = 1079| year = 2014| last1 = Elhami Khorasani | first1 = A. | last2 = Griswold | first2 = M. | last3 = Alford | first3 = T.

For most applications, the effect is also negligible for [[Schottky diode]]s.\n\nThe reverse current ceases abruptly when the stored charge is depleted; this abrupt stop is exploited in [[step recovery diode]]s for generation of extremely short pulses.\n\n==Types of semiconductor diode==\n[[File:Diodes.jpg|right|thumb|Several types of diodes. The scale is centimeters.]]\n[[File:DO-41 Dimensions.svg|right|thumb|150px|Typical datasheet drawing showing the dimensions of a DO-41 diode package]]\n\nThere are several types of [[p\u2013n diode|p\u2013n junction diode]]s, which emphasize either a different physical aspect of a diode often by geometric scaling, doping level, choosing the right electrodes, are just an application of a diode in a special circuit, or are really different devices like the Gunn and laser diode and the [[MOSFET]]:\n\nNormal (p\u2013n) diodes, which operate as described above, are usually made of doped [[silicon]] or, more rarely, [[germanium]]. Before the development of silicon power rectifier diodes, [[cuprous oxide]] and later [[selenium]] was used. Their low efficiency required a much higher forward voltage to be applied (typically 1.4 to 1.7&nbsp;V per \"cell\", with multiple cells stacked so as to increase the peak inverse voltage rating for application in high voltage rectifiers), and required a large heat sink (often an extension of the diode's metal [[Substrate (semiconductor)|substrate]]), much larger than the later silicon diode of the same current ratings would require. The vast majority of all diodes are the p\u2013n diodes found in [[CMOS]] [[integrated circuits]], which include two diodes per pin and many other internal diodes.\n\n;[[Avalanche diode]]s\n:These are diodes that conduct in the reverse direction when the reverse bias voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage. These are electrically very similar to Zener diodes (and are often mistakenly called Zener diodes), but break down by a different mechanism: the ''avalanche effect''. This occurs when the reverse electric field applied across the p\u2013n junction causes a wave of ionization, reminiscent of an avalanche, leading to a large current. Avalanche diodes are designed to break down at a well-defined reverse voltage without being destroyed. The difference between the avalanche diode (which has a reverse breakdown above about 6.2&nbsp;V) and the Zener is that the channel length of the former exceeds the mean free path of the electrons, resulting in many collisions between them on the way through the channel. The only practical difference between the two types is they have temperature coefficients of opposite polarities.\n;[[Cat's whisker diode|Cat's whisker or crystal diodes]]\n:These are a type of point-contact diode. The cat's whisker diode consists of a thin or sharpened metal wire pressed against a semiconducting crystal, typically [[galena]] or a piece of [[coal]]. The wire forms the anode and the crystal forms the cathode. Cat's whisker diodes were also called crystal diodes and found application in the earliest radios called [[crystal radio receiver]]s. Cat's whisker diodes are generally obsolete, but may be available from a few manufacturers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n;[[Constant current diode]]s\n:These are actually [[JFET]]s<ref>[http://digikey.com/Web%20Export/Supplier%20Content/Vishay_8026/PDF/Vishay_CurrentRegulatorDiodes.pdf Current regulator diodes].

The first LEDs were red and yellow, and higher-frequency diodes have been developed over time. All LEDs produce incoherent, narrow-spectrum light; \"white\" LEDs are actually combinations of three LEDs of a different color, or a blue LED with a yellow [[scintillator]] coating. LEDs can also be used as low-efficiency photodiodes in signal applications. An LED may be paired with a photodiode or phototransistor in the same package, to form an [[opto-isolator]].\n;[[Laser diode]]s\n:When an LED-like structure is contained in a [[optical cavity|resonant cavity]] formed by polishing the parallel end faces, a [[laser]] can be formed. Laser diodes are commonly used in [[optical storage]] devices and for high speed [[optical communication]].\n;[[Thermal diode]]s\n:This term is used both for conventional p\u2013n diodes used to monitor temperature because of their varying forward voltage with temperature, and for [[Peltier\u2013Seebeck effect|Peltier heat pumps]] for [[thermoelectric cooling|thermoelectric heating and cooling]]. Peltier heat pumps may be made from semiconductor, though they do not have any rectifying junctions, they use the differing behaviour of charge carriers in N and P type semiconductor to move heat.\n;Perun's diodes\n:This is a special type of voltage-surge protection diode. It is characterized by the symmetrical voltage-current characteristic, similar to [[DIAC]].

This is typically an undesired effect, so most semiconductors are packaged in light blocking material. Photodiodes are intended to sense light([[photodetector]]), so they are packaged in materials that allow light to pass, and are usually PIN (the kind of diode most sensitive to light).<ref>[http://digikey.com/Web%20Export/Supplier%20Content/Vishay_8026/PDF/Vishay_ComponentConstruction.pdf Component Construction].

Furthermore, the PIN structure can be found in many [[power semiconductor device]]s, such as [[IGBT]]s, power [[MOSFET]]s, and [[thyristor]]s.\n;[[Schottky diode]]s\n:[[Walter H. Schottky|Schottky]] diodes are constructed from a metal to semiconductor contact. They have a lower forward voltage drop than p\u2013n junction diodes. Their forward voltage drop at forward currents of about 1&nbsp;mA is in the range 0.15&nbsp;V to 0.45&nbsp;V, which makes them useful in voltage [[Clamper (electronics)|clamping applications]] and prevention of transistor saturation. They can also be used as low loss [[rectifier]]s, although their reverse leakage current is in general higher than that of other diodes. Schottky diodes are [[majority carrier]] devices and so do not suffer from minority carrier storage problems that slow down many other diodes\u2014so they have a faster reverse recovery than p\u2013n junction diodes. They also tend to have much lower junction capacitance than p\u2013n diodes, which provides for high switching speeds and their use in high-speed circuitry and RF devices such as [[switched-mode power supply]], [[Frequency mixer|mixer]]s, and [[Detector (radio)|detectors]].\n;Super barrier diodes\n:Super barrier diodes are rectifier diodes that incorporate the low forward voltage drop of the Schottky diode with the surge-handling capability and low reverse leakage current of a normal p\u2013n junction diode.\n;[[Gold]]-doped diodes\n:As a dopant, gold (or [[platinum]]) acts as recombination centers, which helps a fast recombination of minority carriers. This allows the diode to operate at signal frequencies, at the expense of a higher forward voltage drop. Gold-doped diodes are faster than other p\u2013n diodes (but not as fast as Schottky diodes). They also have less reverse-current leakage than Schottky diodes (but not as good as other p\u2013n diodes).<ref>[http://www.ixyspower.com/images/technical_support/Application%20Notes%20By%20Topic/FREDs,%20Schottky%20and%20GaAS%20Diodes/IXAN0044.pdf Fast Recovery Epitaxial Diodes (FRED) Characteristics \u2013 Applications \u2013 Examples].

After a forward current has been passing in an [[Step recovery diode|SRD]] and the current is interrupted or reversed, the reverse conduction will cease very abruptly (as in a step waveform). SRDs can, therefore, provide very fast voltage transitions by the very sudden disappearance of the charge carriers.\n;[[Stabistor]]s or ''Forward Reference Diodes''\n: The term ''stabistor'' refers to a special type of diodes featuring extremely stable [[p\u2013n junction#Forward bias|forward voltage]] characteristics.

These are important in PLL ([[phase-locked loop]]) and FLL ([[frequency-locked loop]]) circuits, allowing tuning circuits, such as those in television receivers, to lock quickly on to the frequency. They also enabled tunable oscillators in early discrete tuning of radios, where a cheap and stable, but fixed-frequency, crystal oscillator provided the reference frequency for a [[voltage-controlled oscillator]].\n;[[Zener diode]]s\n:These can be made to conduct in reverse bias (backward), and are correctly termed reverse breakdown diodes. This effect, called [[Zener breakdown]], occurs at a precisely defined voltage, allowing the diode to be used as a precision voltage reference. The term Zener diode is colloquially applied to several types of breakdown diodes, but strictly speaking Zener diodes have a breakdown voltage of below 5 volts, whilst avalanche diodes are used for breakdown voltages above that value. In practical voltage reference circuits, Zener and switching diodes are connected in series and opposite directions to balance the temperature coefficient response of the diodes to near-zero. Some devices labeled as high-voltage Zener diodes are actually avalanche diodes (see above). Two (equivalent) Zeners in series and in reverse order, in the same package, constitute a transient absorber (or [[Transorb]], a registered trademark).\n\nOther uses for semiconductor diodes include the sensing of temperature, and computing analog [[logarithm]]s (see [[Operational amplifier applications#Logarithmic output]]).\n\n==Numbering and coding schemes==\nThere are a number of common, standard and manufacturer-driven numbering and coding schemes for diodes; the two most common being the [[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]]/[[JEDEC]] standard and the European [[Pro Electron]] standard:\n\n===EIA/JEDEC===\nThe standardized 1N-series numbering ''[[JEDEC#Origins|EIA370]]'' system was introduced in the US by EIA/JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) about 1960. Most diodes have a 1-prefix designation (e.g., 1N4003). Among the most popular in this series were: 1N34A/1N270 (germanium signal), 1N914/[[1N4148 signal diode|1N4148]] (silicon signal), [[1N400x general-purpose diodes|1N400x]] (silicon 1A power rectifier), and [[1N58xx schottky diodes|1N580x]] (silicon 3A power rectifier).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jedec.org/Home/about_jedec.cfm |title=About JEDEC |publisher=Jedec.org |accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.elektroda.net/introduction-dates-of-common-transistors-and-diodes-t94332.html |title=Introduction dates of common transistors and diodes? |publisher=EDAboard.com |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2010-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011133032/http://news.elektroda.net/introduction-dates-of-common-transistors-and-diodes-t94332.html |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://semiconductormuseum.com/Museum_Index.htm |title=Transistor Museum Construction Projects Point Contact Germanium Western Electric Vintage Historic Semiconductors Photos Alloy Junction Oral History |publisher=Semiconductormuseum.com |author=I.D.E.A |accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref>\n\n===JIS===\nThe [[JIS semiconductor designation]] system has all semiconductor diode designations starting with \"1S\".\n\n===Pro Electron===\nThe European [[Pro Electron]] coding system for [[active component]]s was introduced in 1966 and comprises two letters followed by the part code. The first letter represents the semiconductor material used for the component (A = germanium and B = silicon) and the second letter represents the general function of the part (for diodes, A = low-power/signal, B = variable capacitance, X = multiplier, Y = rectifier and Z = voltage reference); for example:\n\n*AA-series germanium low-power/signal diodes (e.g., AA119)\n*BA-series silicon low-power/signal diodes (e.g., BAT18 silicon RF switching diode)\n*BY-series silicon rectifier diodes (e.g., BY127 1250V, 1A rectifier diode)\n*BZ-series silicon Zener diodes (e.g., BZY88C4V7 4.7V Zener diode)\n\nOther common numbering / coding systems (generally manufacturer-driven) include:\n\n*GD-series germanium diodes (e.g., GD9){{spaced ndash}}this is a very old coding system\n*OA-series germanium diodes (e.g., OA47){{spaced ndash}}a [[Mullard\u2013Philips tube designation|coding sequence]] developed by [[Mullard]], a UK company\n\nAs well as these common codes, many manufacturers or organisations have their own systems too{{spaced ndash}}for example:\n\n*HP diode 1901-0044 = JEDEC 1N4148\n*UK military diode CV448 = Mullard type OA81 = [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] type GEX23\n\n==Related devices==\n*[[Rectifier]]\n*[[Transistor]]\n*[[Thyristor]] or silicon controlled rectifier (SCR)\n*[[TRIAC]]\n*[[DIAC]]\n*[[Varistor]]\nIn optics, an equivalent device for the diode but with laser light would be the [[Optical isolator]], also known as an Optical Diode, that allows light to only pass in one direction. It uses a [[Faraday rotator]] as the main component.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Radio demodulation===\n[[File:Simple envelope detector.svg|thumb|300x300px|A simple [[envelope detector|envelope demodulator]] circuit.]]\nThe first use for the diode was the demodulation of [[amplitude modulation|amplitude modulated]] (AM) radio broadcasts. The history of this discovery is treated in depth in the [[radio]] article. In summary, an AM signal consists of alternating positive and negative peaks of a radio carrier wave, whose [[amplitude]] or envelope is proportional to the original audio signal. The diode (originally a crystal diode) [[rectifier|rectifies]] the AM radio frequency signal, leaving only the positive peaks of the carrier wave. The audio is then extracted from the rectified carrier wave using a simple [[electronic filter|filter]] and fed into an audio amplifier or [[transducer]], which generates sound waves.\n\n===Power conversion===\n{{Main|Rectifier}}\n[[File:ACtoDCpowersupply.png|250px|thumb|Schematic of basic AC-to-DC power supply]]\n\n[[Rectifier]]s are constructed from diodes, where they are used to convert [[alternating current]] (AC) electricity into [[direct current]] (DC). Automotive [[alternator (auto)|alternator]]s are a common example, where the diode, which rectifies the AC into DC, provides better performance than the [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] or earlier, [[electrical generator|dynamo]]. Similarly, diodes are also used in ''[[Cockcroft-Walton generator|Cockcroft\u2013Walton]] [[voltage multiplier]]s'' to convert AC into higher DC voltages.\n\n===Over-voltage protection===\nDiodes are frequently used to conduct damaging high voltages away from sensitive electronic devices. They are usually reverse-biased (non-conducting) under normal circumstances. When the voltage rises above the normal range, the diodes become forward-biased (conducting). For example, diodes are used in ([[stepper motor]] and [[H-bridge]]) [[motor controller]] and [[relay]] circuits to de-energize coils rapidly without the damaging [[voltage spike]]s that would otherwise occur. (A diode used in such an application is called a [[flyback diode]]). Many [[integrated circuits]] also incorporate diodes on the connection pins to prevent external voltages from damaging their sensitive [[transistors]]. Specialized diodes are used to protect from over-voltages at higher power (see [[#Types of semiconductor diode|Diode types]] above).\n\n===Logic gates===\nDiodes can be combined with other components to construct [[logical conjunction|AND]] and [[logical disjunction|OR]] [[logic gate]]s. This is referred to as [[diode logic]].\n\n===Ionizing radiation detectors===\nIn addition to light, mentioned above, [[semiconductor]] diodes are sensitive to more [[energy|energetic]] radiation. In [[electronics]], [[cosmic ray]]s and other sources of ionizing radiation cause [[noise]] [[pulse]]s and single and multiple bit errors.\nThis effect is sometimes exploited by [[particle detector]]s to detect radiation. A single particle of radiation, with thousands or millions of [[electron volt]]s of energy, generates many charge carrier pairs, as its energy is deposited in the semiconductor material. If the depletion layer is large enough to catch the whole shower or to stop a heavy particle, a fairly accurate measurement of the particle's energy can be made, simply by measuring the charge conducted and without the complexity of a magnetic spectrometer, etc.\nThese semiconductor radiation detectors need efficient and uniform charge collection and low leakage current. They are often cooled by [[liquid nitrogen]]. For longer-range (about a centimetre) particles, they need a very large depletion depth and large area. For short-range particles, they need any contact or un-depleted semiconductor on at least one surface to be very thin. The back-bias voltages are near breakdown (around a thousand volts per centimetre). Germanium and silicon are common materials. Some of these detectors sense position as well as energy.\nThey have a finite life, especially when detecting heavy particles, because of radiation damage. Silicon and germanium are quite different in their ability to convert [[gamma ray]]s to electron showers.\n\n[[Semiconductor detector]]s for high-energy particles are used in large numbers. Because of energy loss fluctuations, accurate measurement of the energy deposited is of less use.\n\n===Temperature measurements===\nA diode can be used as a [[temperature]] measuring device, since the forward voltage drop across the diode depends on temperature, as in a [[silicon bandgap temperature sensor]]. From the Shockley ideal diode equation given above, it might ''appear'' that the voltage has a ''positive'' temperature coefficient (at a constant current), but usually the variation of the [[Saturation current|reverse saturation current]] term is more significant than the variation in the thermal voltage term. Most diodes therefore have a ''negative'' temperature coefficient, typically \u22122 mV/\u02daC for silicon diodes. The temperature coefficient is approximately constant for temperatures above about 20 [[kelvin]]s. Some graphs are given for 1N400x series,<ref>[http://www.cliftonlaboratories.com/1n400x_diode_family_forward_voltage.htm 1N400x Diode Family Forward Voltage]. Cliftonlaboratories.com. Retrieved 2013-12-19.</ref> and CY7 cryogenic temperature sensor.<ref>[http://www.omega.com/Temperature/pdf/CY7.pdf Cryogenic Temperature Sensors]. omega.com</ref>\n\n===Current steering===\nDiodes will prevent currents in unintended directions. To supply power to an electrical circuit during a power failure, the circuit can draw current from a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. An [[uninterruptible power supply]] may use diodes in this way to ensure that current is only drawn from the battery when necessary. Likewise, small boats typically have two circuits each with their own battery/batteries: one used for engine starting; one used for domestics. Normally, both are charged from a single alternator, and a heavy-duty split-charge diode is used to prevent the higher-charge battery (typically the engine battery) from discharging through the lower-charge battery when the alternator is not running.\n\nDiodes are also used in [[electronic keyboards|electronic musical keyboards]]. To reduce the amount of wiring needed in electronic musical keyboards, these instruments often use [[keyboard matrix (music)|keyboard matrix]] circuits. The keyboard controller scans the rows and columns to determine which note the player has pressed. The problem with matrix circuits is that, when several notes are pressed at once, the current can flow backwards through the circuit and trigger \"[[Keyboard (computing)#Control processor|phantom keys]]\" that cause \"ghost\" notes to play. To avoid triggering unwanted notes, most keyboard matrix circuits have diodes soldered with the switch under each key of the [[musical keyboard]]. The same principle is also used for the switch matrix in solid-state [[pinball machine]]s.\n\n===Waveform Clipper===\n{{main|Clipper (electronics)}}\nDiodes can be used to limit the positive or negative excursion of a signal to a prescribed voltage.\n\n===Clamper===\n{{main|Clamper (electronics)}}\n[[File:DiodeClamp.png|150px|thumb|This simple diode clamp will clamp the negative peaks of the incoming waveform to the common rail voltage]]\nA diode [[Clamper (electronics)|clamp circuit]] can take a periodic alternating current signal that oscillates between positive and negative values, and vertically displace it such that either the positive, or the negative peaks occur at a prescribed level. The clamper does not restrict the peak-to-peak excursion of the signal, it moves the whole signal up or down so as to place the peaks at the reference level.\n\n==Abbreviations==\nDiodes are usually referred to as ''D'' for diode on [[printed circuit board|PCBs]]. Sometimes the abbreviation ''CR'' for ''crystal rectifier'' is used.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Ambrose Fleming|year=1919|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xHNBAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA550|title=The Principles of Electric Wave Telegraphy and Telephony|place=London|publisher=Longmans, Green|page=550}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n*[[Active rectification]]\n*[[Diode modelling]]\n*[[wikt:junction diode|Junction diode]]\n*[[Lambda diode]]\n*[[p\u2013n junction]]\n*[[Small-signal model]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Diodes}}\n*[http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_3/chpt_3/1.html Diodes and Rectifiers] \u2013 Chapter on All About Circuits\n*[http://www.powerguru.org/structure-and-functional-behavior-of-pin-diodes/ Structure and Functional Behavior of PIN Diodes] \u2013 PowerGuru\n\n;Interactive and animations\n*[http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/mmg/teaching/linearcircuits/diode.html Interactive Explanation of Semiconductor Diode], University of Cambridge\n*[http://www.ee.byu.edu/cleanroom/schottky_animation.phtml Schottky Diode Flash Tutorial Animation]\n\n;Datasheets\n* [https://archive.org/details/NationalSemiconductorDiscreteDatabook1978 Discrete Databook (Historical 1978)], National Semiconductor (now Texas Instruments)\n* [https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_sgsdataBooDevices5ed_46325378 Discrete Databook (Historical 1982)], SGS (now STMicroelectronics)\n* [https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_fairchilddldDiscreteDataBook_35122751 Discrete Databook (Historical 1985)], Fairchild\n\n{{Electronic component}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Diodes| ]]"}]}}}}
