The electric field combines with the magnetic field to form the [[electromagnetic field]].\n\n==Definition==\n\nThe electric field, <math>\\mathbf{E}</math>, at a given point is defined as the (vectorial) force, <math>\\mathbf{F}</math>, that would be exerted on a stationary [[test particle]] of unit charge by electromagnetic forces (i.e. the [[Lorentz force]]). A particle of [[electric charge|charge]] <math>q</math> would be subject to a force <math>\\mathbf{F}=q\\cdot\\mathbf{E}</math>.\n\nIts [[SI]] units are [[newton (unit)|newton]]s per [[coulomb]] (N\u22c5C<sup>\u22121</sup>) or, equivalently, [[volt]]s per [[metre]] (V\u22c5m<sup>\u22121</sup>), which in terms of [[SI base unit]]s are kg\u22c5m\u22c5s<sup>\u22123</sup>\u22c5A<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\n==Sources of electric field==\n\n===Causes and description===\n\nElectric fields are caused by [[electric charges]] or varying [[magnetic fields]]. The former effect is described by [[Gauss's law]], the latter by [[Faraday's law of induction]], which together are enough to define the behavior of the electric field as a function of charge repartition and magnetic field. However, since the magnetic field is described as a function of electric field, the equations of both fields are coupled and together form [[Maxwell's equations]] that describe both fields as a function of charges and [[Electric current|currents]].\n\nIn the special case of a [[steady state]] (stationary charges and currents), the Maxwell-Faraday inductive effect disappears. The resulting two equations (Gauss's law <math>\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\varepsilon_0}</math> and Faraday's law with no induction term <math>\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = 0</math>), taken together, are equivalent to [[Coulomb's law#Electric field|Coulomb's law]], written as <math>\\boldsymbol{E}(\\boldsymbol{r}) = {1\\over 4\\pi\\varepsilon_0}\\int d\\boldsymbol{r'} \\rho(\\boldsymbol{r'}) {\\boldsymbol{r} - \\boldsymbol{r'} \\over |\\boldsymbol{r} - \\boldsymbol{r'}|^3}</math> for a [[charge density]]\n<math>\\mathbf{\\rho}(\\mathbf{r})</math> (<math>\\mathbf{r}</math> denotes the position in space). Notice that <math>\\varepsilon_0</math>, the [[permittivity]] of vacuum, must be substituted if charges are considered in non-empty media.\n\n===Continuous vs. discrete charge repartition===\n\n{{Main|Charge density}}\n\nThe equations of electromagnetism are best described in a continuous description. However, charges are sometimes best described as discrete points; for example, some models may describe [[electrons]] as point sources where charge density is infinite on an infinitesimal section of space.\n\nA charge <math>q</math> located at <math>\\mathbf{r_0}</math> can be described mathematically as a charge density <math>\\rho(\\mathbf{r})=q\\delta(\\mathbf{r-r_0})</math>, where the [[Dirac delta function]] (in three dimensions) is used. Conversely, a charge distribution can be approximated by many small point charges.\n\n==Superposition principle==\n\nElectric fields satisfy the [[superposition principle]], because [[Maxwell's equations]] are [[Linear differential equation|linear]]. As a result, if <math>\\mathbf{E}_1</math> and <math>\\mathbf{E}_2</math> are the electric fields resulting from distribution of charges <math>\\rho_1</math> and <math>\\rho_2</math>, a distribution of charges <math>\\rho_1+\\rho_2</math> will create an electric field <math>\\mathbf{E}_1+\\mathbf{E}_2</math>; for instance, [[Coulomb's law]] is linear in charge density as well.\n\nThis principle is useful to calculate the field created by multiple point charges. If charges <math>q_1, q_2, ..., q_n</math> are stationary in space at <math>\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2,...\\mathbf{r}_n</math>, in the absence of currents, the superposition principle proves that the resulting field is the sum of fields generated by each particle as described by [[Coulomb's law]]:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\mathbf{E}_i(\\mathbf{r}) =\n\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0} \\sum_{i=1}^N q_i \\frac{\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_i}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_i|^3}</math>\n\n==Electrostatic fields==\n\n{{Main|Electrostatics}}\n\n[[Image:VFPt charges plus minus thumb.svg|220px|thumb|right|Illustration of the electric field surrounding a positive (red) and a negative (blue) charge.]]\n[[File:14. \u0415\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0438.ogg|thumb|right|280px|Experiment illustrating electric field lines. An [[electrode]] connected to an [[electrostatic induction]] machine is placed in an oil-filled container. Considering that oil is a dielectric medium, when current is ran through the electrode, the particles arrange themselves so as to show the force lines of the electric field. <small>Performed by Prof. Oliver Zajkov at the Physics Institute at the [[Ss. Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje]], Macedonia.</small>]]\n\nElectrostatic fields are '''E'''-fields which do not change with time, which happens when charges and currents are stationary. In that case, [[Coulomb's law]] fully describes the field.\n\n===Electric potential===\n{{Main|Conservative vector field#Irrotational vector fields}}\n\nIf a system is static, such that magnetic fields are not time varying, then by Faraday's law, the electric field is curl-free. In this case, one can define an [[electric potential]], that is, a function <math>\\Phi</math> such that <math> \\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla \\Phi </math>.<ref>http://physicspages.com/2011/10/08/curl-potential-in-electrostatics/</ref>\nThis is analogous to the [[gravitational potential]].\n\n===Parallels between electrostatic and gravitational fields===\n[[Coulomb's law]], which describes the interaction of electric charges:\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{F}=q\\left(\\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0}\\frac{\\mathbf{\\hat{r}}}{|\\mathbf{r}|^2}\\right)=q\\mathbf{E}\n</math>\n\nis similar to [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]]:\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{F}=m\\left(-GM\\frac{\\mathbf{\\hat{r}}}{|\\mathbf{r}|^2}\\right)=m\\mathbf{g}\n</math>\n\n(where <math>\\mathbf{\\hat{r}}=\\mathbf{\\frac{r}{|r|}}</math>).\n\nThis suggests similarities between the electric field '''E''' and the gravitational field '''g''', or their associated potentials. Mass is sometimes called \"gravitational charge\" because of that similarity.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nElectrostatic and gravitational forces both are [[central force|central]], [[conservative force|conservative]] and obey an [[inverse-square law]].\n\n===Uniform fields===\n\nA uniform field is one in which the electric field is constant at every point. It can be approximated by placing two conducting [[Capacitor#Parallel-plate model|plates]] parallel to each other and maintaining a [[voltage]] (potential difference) between them; it is only an approximation because of boundary effects (near the edge of the planes, electric field is distorted because the plane does not continue). Assuming infinite planes, the magnitude of the electric field ''E'' is:\n\n:<math> E = - \\frac{\\Delta\\phi}{d}</math>\n\nwhere \u0394''\u03d5'' is the [[potential difference]] between the plates and ''d'' is the distance separating the plates. The negative sign arises as positive charges repel, so a positive charge will experience a force away from the positively charged plate, in the opposite direction to that in which the voltage increases. In micro- and nanoapplications, for instance in relation to semiconductors, a typical magnitude of an electric field is in the order of {{val|e=6|u=V\u22c5m<sup>\u22121</sup>}}, achieved by applying a voltage of the order of 1 volt between conductors spaced 1&nbsp;\u00b5m apart.\n\n==Electrodynamic fields==\n\n{{Main|Electrodynamics}}\n\nElectrodynamic fields are '''E'''-fields which do change with time, for instance when charges are in motion.\n\nThe electric field cannot be described independently of the magnetic field in that case. If '''A''' is the [[magnetic vector potential]], defined so that <math> \\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A} </math>, one can still define an electric potential <math> \\Phi</math> such that:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{E} = - \\nabla \\Phi - \\frac { \\partial \\mathbf{A} } { \\partial t }</math>\n\nOne can recover [[Faraday's law of induction]] by taking the curl of that equation\n:<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Maxwell's Equations\n|first1=Paul G.\n|last1=Huray\n|publisher=Wiley-IEEE\n|year=2009\n|isbn=0-470-54276-4\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QsDgdd0MhMCp\n|page= 205}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A})} {\\partial t}=\n-\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}} {\\partial t}</math>\n\nwhich justifies, a posteriori, the previous form for '''E'''.\n\n==Energy in the electric field==\n\nIf the magnetic field '''B''' is nonzero,\n\nThe total energy per unit volume stored by the electromagnetic field is<ref>Introduction to Electrodynamics (3rd Edition), D.J. Griffiths, Pearson Education, Dorling Kindersley, 2007, ISBN 81-7758-293-3</ref>\n\n:<math> u_{EM} = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}  |\\mathbf{E}|^2 + \\frac{1}{2\\mu} |\\mathbf{B}|^2 </math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b5'' is the [[permittivity]] of the medium in which the field exists, <math>\\mu</math> its [[magnetic permeability]], and '''E''' and '''B''' are the electric and magnetic field vectors.\n\nAs '''E''' and '''B''' fields are coupled, it would be misleading to split this expression into \"electric\" and \"magnetic\" contributions. However, in the steady-state case, the fields are no longer coupled (see [[Maxwell's equations]]). It makes sense in that case to compute the electrostatic energy per unit volume:\n\n:<math> u_{ES} = \\frac{1}{2} \\varepsilon |\\mathbf{E}|^2 \\, ,</math>\n\nThe total energy ''U'' stored in the electric field in a given volume ''V'' is therefore\n:<math> U_{ES} = \\frac{1}{2} \\varepsilon \\int_{V} |\\mathbf{E}|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}V \\, ,</math>\n\n==Further extensions==\n\n===Definitive equation of vector fields===\n\n{{See also|Defining equation (physics)|List of electromagnetism equations}}\n\nIn the presence of matter, it is helpful in electromagnetism to extend the notion of the electric field into three vector fields, rather than just one:<ref>Electromagnetism (2nd Edition), I.S. Grant, W.R. Phillips, Manchester Physics, John Wiley & Sons, 2008, ISBN 978-0-471-92712-9</ref>\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{D}=\\varepsilon_0\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{P}\\!</math>\n\nwhere '''P''' is the [[electric polarization]] \u2013 the volume density of [[electric dipole moment]]s, and '''D''' is the [[electric displacement field]]. Since '''E''' and '''P''' are defined separately, this equation can be used to define '''D'''. The physical interpretation of '''D''' is not as clear as '''E''' (effectively the field applied to the material) or '''P''' (induced field due to the dipoles in the material), but still serves as a convenient mathematical simplification, since Maxwell's equations can be simplified in terms of [[Maxwell's equations#Table of 'macroscopic' equations|free charges and currents]].\n\n===Constitutive relation===\n\n{{Main|Constitutive equation}}\n\nThe '''E''' and '''D''' fields are related by the [[permittivity]] of the material, ''\u03b5''.<ref>Electricity and Modern Physics (2nd Edition), G.A.G.

Phillips, Manchester Physics, John Wiley & Sons, 2008, ISBN 978-0-471-92712-9</ref>\n \nFor linear, [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous]], [[Isotropy|isotropic]] materials '''E''' and '''D''' are proportional and constant throughout the region, there is no position dependence: For inhomogeneous materials, there is a position dependence throughout the material:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{D(r)}=\\varepsilon\\mathbf{E(r)}</math>\n\nFor anisotropic materials the '''E''' and '''D''' fields are not parallel, and so '''E''' and '''D''' are related by the [[Permittivity|permittivity tensor]] (a 2nd order [[tensor field]]), in component form:\n\n:<math>D_i=\\varepsilon_{ij}E_j</math>\n\nFor non-linear media, '''E''' and '''D''' are not proportional. Materials can have varying extents of linearity, homogeneity and isotropy.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Classical electromagnetism]]\n* [[Field strength]]\n* [[Signal strength]] in telecommunications\n* [[Magnetism]]\n* [[Teltron Tube]]\n* [[Teledeltos]], a conductive paper that may be used as a simple analog computer for modelling fields\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/elefie.html Electric field in \"Electricity and Magnetism\", R Nave] \u2013 [[Hyperphysics]], [[Georgia State University]]\n*[http://teacher.pas.rochester.edu/phy122/Lecture_Notes/Chapter24/Chapter24.html 'Gauss's Law' \u2013 Chapter 24 of Frank Wolfs's lectures] at [[University of Rochester]]\n*[http://teacher.pas.rochester.edu/phy122/Lecture_Notes/Chapter23/Chapter23.html#Heading3 'The Electric Field' \u2013 Chapter 23 of Frank Wolfs's lectures] at [[University of Rochester]]\n*[http://www.its.caltech.edu/~phys1/java/phys1/MovingCharge/MovingCharge.html] \u2013 An applet that shows the electric field of a moving point charge.\n*[http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/0sn/ch10/ch10.html Fields] \u2013 a chapter from an online textbook\n*[http://www.vias.org/simulations/simusoft_efield.html Learning by Simulations] Interactive simulation of an electric field of up to four point charges\n*Java simulations of [http://www.falstad.com/emstatic/ electrostatics in 2-D] and [http://www.falstad.com/vector3de/ 3-D]\n*[http://www.flashphysics.org/electricField.html Interactive Flash simulation picturing the electric field of user-defined or preselected sets of point charges] by field vectors, field lines, or equipotential lines.
