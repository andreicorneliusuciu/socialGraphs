The target possesses samples of [[primary colors]] and a [[grey scale]]. The camera uses this much like a photographer would use a [[chip chart]] on Earth; the color samples allow the camera to compensate for [[white balance]] and [[contrast (vision)|contrast]]. The target provides a visual reference as well, so that the initial [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]] of the camera can be fixed.\n\nOn the Mars Exploration Rover, the target was designed with a pillar elevated above the main surface, so that it could be used as a [[sundial]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Test Target}}\n[[Category:Spacecraft components]]\n\n\n{{Spacecraft-stub}}"}]}}}}
