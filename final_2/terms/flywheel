Flywheels have an inertia called the [[moment of inertia]] and thus resist changes in rotational speed. The amount of energy stored in a flywheel is proportional to the square of its [[rotational speed]]. Energy is transferred to a flywheel by the application of a [[torque]] to it, thereby increasing its rotational speed, and hence its stored energy. Conversely, a flywheel releases stored energy by applying torque to a mechanical load, thereby decreasing the flywheel's rotational speed.\n\nCommon uses of a flywheel include:\n* Providing continuous energy when the energy source is discontinuous. For example, flywheels are used in [[reciprocating engine]]s because the energy source, torque from the engine, is intermittent.\n* Delivering energy at rates beyond the ability of a continuous energy source. This is achieved by collecting energy in the flywheel over time and then releasing the energy quickly, at rates that exceed the abilities of the energy source.\n* Controlling the orientation of a mechanical system. In such applications, the [[angular momentum]] of a flywheel is purposely transferred as a torque to the attaching mechanical system when energy is transferred to or from the flywheel, thereby causing the attaching system to rotate into some desired position.\n\nFlywheels are typically made of steel and rotate on conventional bearings; these are generally limited to a revolution rate of a few thousand RPM.<ref name=\"BBC\">[http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120629-reinventing-the-wheel]; \"Flywheels move from steam age technology to Formula 1\"; Jon Stewart | 1 July 2012, retrieved 2012-07-03</ref>  Some modern flywheels are made of carbon fiber materials and employ [[magnetic bearing]]s, enabling them to revolve at speeds up to 60,000 RPM (1 kHz).<ref name =\"Kinergy\">[http://www.ricardo.com/en-GB/News--Media/Press-releases/News-releases1/2011/Breakthrough-in-Ricardo-Kinergy-second-generation-high-speed-flywheel-technology/], \"Breakthrough in Ricardo Kinergy \u2018second generation\u2019 high-speed flywheel technology\"; Press release date: 22 August 2011. retrieved 2012-07-03</ref>\n\nCarbon-composite flywheel batteries have recently been manufactured and are proving to be viable in real-world tests on mainstream cars. Additionally, their disposal is more eco-friendly.<ref>http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/news/10-tech-concepts-you-need-to-know-for-2012-2</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:Landini VL30(Italien)2.JPG|thumb|A [[Landini (tractor)|Landini]] tractor with exposed flywheel.]]\nFlywheels are often used to provide continuous energy in systems where the energy source is not continuous. In such cases, the flywheel stores energy when torque is applied by the energy source, and it releases stored energy when the energy source is not applying torque to it. For example, a flywheel is used to maintain constant angular velocity of the [[crankshaft]] in a reciprocating engine. In this case, the flywheel\u2014which is mounted on the crankshaft\u2014stores energy when torque is exerted on it by a firing [[piston]], and it releases energy to the crankshaft when a piston is in the process of compressing a fresh charge of air and fuel. Other examples of this are [[friction motor]]s, which use flywheel energy to power devices such as [[toy car]]s. In uses like this, the distribution of the mass of the flywheel toward the outside and away from the center is beneficial.  Pushing the mass away from the axis of rotation gives it greater [[rotational inertia]] without increasing its total mass. This increases the efficiency of the flywheel, since it does not have as much difficulty driving its own weight forward as well as that of the payload.\n\n[[File:P307.jpg|thumb|Modern automobile engine flywheel]]\nA flywheel may also be used to supply intermittent pulses of energy at transfer rates that exceed the abilities of its energy source, or when such pulses would disrupt the energy supply (e.g., public electric network). This is achieved by accumulating stored energy in the flywheel over a period of time, at a rate that is compatible with the energy source, and then releasing that energy at a much higher rate over a relatively short time when it is needed. For example, flywheels are used in [[riveting machines]] to store energy from the motor and release it during the riveting operation.A flywheel also doubles the rotational energy received from a source of rotation (e.g motors)\n\n<!-- \nPlease clarify for topic novices and uncomment:\nFlywheels can be used control the orientation of a mechanical system. In such cases, the angular momentum of the flywheel is transferred to the load during energy transfer. As angular momentum is a vector quantity, transfer of angular momentum helps orient the load to a particular axis. \n-->\nThe phenomenon of [[precession]] has to be considered when using flywheels in vehicles. A rotating flywheel responds to any momentum that tends to change the direction of its axis of rotation by a resulting precession rotation. A vehicle with a vertical-axis flywheel, that is rigidly attached to the vehicle, would experience a torque applied to the body of the vehicle that would rotate with as the flywheel precesses. This would produce an alternating rolling and pitching of the vehicle body as it moved up the incline. The descent of the hill would produce the opposite effect and so it would zero out the pitching and rolling ([[wikt:roll|roll]] momentum in response to a pitch change). Two counter-rotating flywheels may be needed to eliminate this effect. This effect is used in [[reaction wheel]]s, a type of flywheel employed in satellites in which the flywheel is used to orient the satellite's instruments without the use of thruster rockets. Alternatively, the flywheel would be mounted in two yokes, with axes at mutual right angles, and so allow limited changes to the orientation of the vehicle body thereby eliminating precession.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe principle of the flywheel is found in the [[Neolithic]] [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]] and the [[potter's wheel]].<ref name=\"Lynn White, Jr. 233\">Lynn White, Jr., \"Theophilus Redivivus\", ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 5, No. 2. (Spring, 1964), Review, pp. 224\u2013233 (233)</ref>\n\nThe use of the flywheel as a general mechanical device to equalize the speed of rotation is, according to the American medievalist [[Lynn White]], recorded in the ''De diversibus artibus'' (On various arts) of the German artisan [[Theophilus Presbyter]] (ca. 1070\u20131125) who records applying the device in several of his machines.<ref name=\"Lynn White, Jr. 233\"/><ref>Lynn White, Jr., \"Medieval Engineering and the Sociology of Knowledge\", ''The Pacific Historical Review'', Vol. 44, No. 1. (Feb., 1975), pp. 1\u201321 (6)</ref>\n\nIn the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[James Watt]] contributed to the development of the flywheel in the [[steam engine]], and his contemporary [[James Pickard]] used a flywheel combined with a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] to transform reciprocating motion into rotary motion.\n\n== Physics ==\n[[File:Leonardo-Flywheel.ogg|thumb|A flywheel with variable moment of inertia, conceived by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].]]\n\nA flywheel is a spinning wheel or disc with a fixed axle so that rotation is only about one axis. Energy is stored in the [[wikt:rotor|rotor]] as [[kinetic energy]], or more specifically, [[rotational energy]]:\n\n* <math>E_k=\\frac{1}{2} I \\omega^2</math>\n\nwhere:\n\n* \u03c9 is the [[angular velocity]], and\n* <math> I </math> is the [[moment of inertia]] of the [[mass]] about the center of rotation. The moment of inertia is the measure of resistance to [[torque]] applied on a spinning object (i.e. the higher the moment of inertia, the slower it will spin when a given force is applied).\n* The moment of inertia for a solid cylinder is <math>I = \\frac{1}{2} mr^2</math>,\n* for a thin-walled empty cylinder is <math>I = m r^2</math>,\n* and for a thick-walled empty cylinder is <math>I = \\frac{1}{2} m({r_\\mathrm{external}}^2 + {r_\\mathrm{internal}}^2) </math>,<ref>[http://www.freestudy.co.uk/dynamics/moment%20of%20inertia.pdf] (page 10, accessed 1 Dec 2011, Moment of inertia tutorial</ref>\n\nwhere ''m'' denotes mass, and ''r'' denotes a radius.\n\nWhen calculating with [[SI]] units, the units would be for mass, [[kilograms]]; for radius, meters; and for angular velocity, [[radian]]s per [[second]] and the resulting energy would be in [[joule]]s.\n\nThe amount of energy that can safely be stored in the rotor depends on the point at which the rotor will warp or shatter. The [[hoop stress]] that develop within the rotor is a major consideration in the design of a [[flywheel energy storage]] system.\n\n* <math> \\sigma_t = \\rho r^2 \\omega^2 \\ </math>\n\nwhere:\n\n* <math> \\sigma_t </math> is the tensile stress on the rim of the cylinder\n* <math> \\rho </math> is the density of the cylinder\n* <math> r </math> is the radius of the cylinder, and\n* <math> \\omega </math> is the [[angular velocity]] of the cylinder.\n\nThis formula can also be simplified using specific tensile strength and tangent velocity:\n\n* <math> \\frac{\\sigma_t}{\\rho} = v^2 </math>\n\nwhere:\n\n* <math> \\frac{\\sigma_t}{\\rho} </math> is the specific tensile strength of the material\n* <math> v </math> is the tangent velocity of the rim.\n\n== Material selection ==\n\nFlywheels are made from many different materials; the demands of the application determine the choice of material. Small flywheels made of lead are found in children\u2019s toys. Cast iron flywheels are used in old steam engines. Flywheels used in cars to smooth power-transmission may be made of cast or nodular iron, steel or aluminum depending on the performance application.<ref>{{cite web|title=Flywheels: Iron vs. Steel vs. Aluminum|url=https://fidanza.com/aluminum-vs-steel/|website=Fidanza Performance|accessdate=6 October 2016}}</ref> Flywheels made from high-strength steel or composites have been proposed for use in vehicle power storage and braking systems.\n\nThe efficiency of a flywheel is determined by the amount of energy it can store per unit weight. As the flywheel\u2019s rotational speed or angular velocity is increased, the stored energy increases; however, the centrifugal stresses also increase. If the centrifugal stresses surpass the tensile strength of the material, the flywheel will break apart. Thus, the tensile strength determines an upper limit to the amount of energy that a flywheel can store.\n\nIn this context, using lead for a flywheel in a child\u2019s toy is not efficient; however, the flywheel velocity never approaches its burst velocity because the limit in this case is the pulling-power of the child. In other applications, such as an automobile, the flywheel operates at a specified angular velocity and is constrained by the space it must fit in, so the goal is to maximize the stored energy per unit volume. The material selection therefore depends on the application.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ashby|first1=Michael|title=Materials Selection in Mechanical Design|date=2011|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Burlington, MA|isbn=978-0-08-095223-9|pages=142\u2013146|edition=4th}}<!--|accessdate=29 October 2015--></ref>\n\nThe table below contains calculated values for materials and comments on their viability for flywheel applications.
