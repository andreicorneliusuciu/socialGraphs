For aircraft it is generally both.\n\nFor aircraft, the landing gear supports the craft when it is not flying, allowing it to take off, land, and taxi without damage. Wheels are typically used but skids, skis, floats or a combination of these and other elements can be deployed depending both on the surface and on whether the craft only operates vertically ([[VTOL]]) or is able to taxi along the surface.  Faster aircraft usually have retractable undercarriages, which folds away during flight to reduce air resistance or drag.\n\nFor [[launch vehicle]]s and [[Lander (spacecraft)|spacecraft landers]], the landing gear is typically designed to support the vehicle only post-flight, and are typically not used for takeoff or surface movement.\n\n==Aircraft landing gear==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 200\n| image1 = Oleo torque link main landing gear.JPG\n| width1 =\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 = [[Oleo strut|Oleo (pressurized gas - oil) strut]] with torque links\n| image2 = Oleo trailing link main landing gear.JPG \n| width2 =\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 = Oleo strut with trailing link\n| image3 = Rubber trailing link main landing gear.JPG\n| width3 =\n| alt3 =\n| caption3 = Rubber discs in compression with trailing link, used on [[Mooney M20]] series of aircraft\n| image4 = Spring steel main landing gear.JPG\n| width4 =\n| alt4 =\n| caption4 = Simple spring steel bar, used on many light aircraft\n| image5 = Tubular main landing gear.JPG\n| width5 =\n| alt5 =\n| caption5 = Simple steel tube\n| header = Methods of landing gear shock absorption\n| header_align = center\n| header_background =\n| footer =\n| footer_align = <!-- left/right/center -->\n| footer_background =\n| background color =\n}}Aircraft landing gear usually includes wheels equipped with simple [[shock absorber]]s, or more advanced air/oil [[oleo strut]]s, for [[runway]] and rough terrain landing.

The taildragger arrangement was common during the early propeller era, as it allows more room for propeller clearance. Most modern aircraft have tricycle undercarriages.  Taildraggers are considered harder to land and take off (because the arrangement is usually ''unstable'', that is, a small deviation from straight-line travel [[Ground loop (aviation)|will tend to increase]] rather than correct itself), and usually require special pilot training.  Sometimes a small tail wheel or skid is added to aircraft with tricycle undercarriage, in case of [[tailstrike|tail strike]]s during take-off.  [[Concorde]], for instance, had a retractable tail \"bumper\" wheel, as [[delta wing]]ed aircraft need a high angle when taking off.  Both Boeing'a largest WW II bomber, the [[B-29 Superfortress]] and the 1960s-introduction [[Boeing 727]] [[trijet]] airliner each have a retractable tail bumper.  Some aircraft with retractable conventional landing gear have a fixed tailwheel, which generates minimal drag (since most of the airflow past the tailwheel has been blanketed by the fuselage) and even improves [[Yaw angle|yaw]] stability in some cases.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\nAnother arrangement sometimes used is central main and nose gear with outriggers on the wings. This may be done where there is no convenient location on either side to attach the main undercarriage or to store it when retracted. Examples include the [[Lockheed U-2]] spy plane and the [[Harrier Jump Jet]].\n\n===Retractable gear===\n[[File:Me-163 Komet (Can).jpg|thumb|left|An [[Messerschmitt Me 163|Me 163B]] ''Komet'' with its two-wheel takeoff \"dolly\" in place]]\n[[File:DHL Boeing 767 (7567986860).jpg|thumb|The landing gear of a [[Boeing 767]] retracting into the fuselage]]\n[[File:Landing gear schematic.svg|thumb|left|Schematic showing hydraulically operated landing gear, with the wheel stowed in the wing root of the aircraft]]\nTo decrease drag in flight some undercarriages retract into the wings and/or fuselage with wheels flush against the surface or concealed behind doors; this is called ''retractable gear.'' If the wheels rest protruding and partially exposed to the airstream after being retracted, the system is called semi-retractable.\n\nMost retraction systems are hydraulically operated, though some are electrically operated or even manually operated. This adds weight and complexity to the design. In retractable gear systems, the compartment where the wheels are stowed are called wheel wells, which may also diminish valuable cargo or fuel space.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n[[File:737under.jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-700]] with main undercarriage retracted in the wheel wells without landing gear doors]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-393-1409-02, Russland, Flugzeug Junkers Ju 87 D.jpg|thumb|left|A Ju 87D with a [[wheel spat]] on the right wheel, absent on the left.]]\n\nPilots confirming that their landing gear is down and locked refer to \"three green\" or \"three in the green.\", a reference to the electrical indicator lights (or painted panels of mechanical indicator units) from the nosewheel/tailwheel and the two main gears.

Whether electrically or hydraulically operated, the landing gear can usually be powered from multiple sources. In case the power system fails, an emergency extension system is always available. This may take the form of a manually operated crank or pump, or a mechanical free-fall mechanism which disengages the uplocks and allows the landing gear to fall due to gravity. Some high-performance aircraft may even feature a pressurized-nitrogen back-up system.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n===Large aircraft===\n[[File:Jet airliner's tire arrangement(6models).PNG|thumb|Wheel arrangements of large airliners]]\n[[File:Antonov An-124.

The [[Airbus A340|Airbus A340-500]]/-600 has an additional four-wheel undercarriage [[bogie]] on the fuselage centerline, much like the twin-wheel unit in the same general location, used on later [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]] and [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11|MD-11]] airliners.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe [[Boeing 747]] has five sets of wheels: a nosewheel assembly and four sets of four-wheel bogies.

The Airbus A380 also has a four-wheel bogie under each wing with two sets of six-wheel bogies under the fuselage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe world's largest jet cargo aircraft, the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Antonov An-225]] has 4 wheels on the twin-strut nose gear units (as its smaller \"stablemate\", the [[Antonov An-124]] also uses), and 28 main gear wheel/tire units, adding up to a total of 32 wheels and tires.<ref>http://gizmodo.com/the-worlds-largest-cargo-plane-can-swallow-a-737-whole-511093454</ref>\n\n===Nautical===\n{{main article|Float (nautical)}}\nSome aircraft have landing gear adapted to take off from and land on water.\n\nA [[floatplane]] has landing gear comprising two or more streamlined floats.\n\nA [[flying boat]] has a lower fuselage possessing the shape of a boat hull giving it buoyancy, usually with a \"step\" near the center of gravity to allow the aircraft to more easily break free of the water's surface for takeoff. Additional landing gear is often present, typically comprising wing-mounted floats, or more rarely, stub-wing like [[sponson]]s on the lower sides of the fuselage, with their lower surfaces even with the [[Chine (boating)|chines]] forming the longitudinal lower corners of a flying boat's lower hull contours.\n\n[[Helicopter]]s able to land on water may have floats or a hull.\n\nAn amphibious aircraft has landing gear for both land and water-based operation.\n\n===Other types of landing gear===\n\n[[File:harrier.gr7.zg472.arp.jpg|thumb|[[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]] GR7 (ZG472).  The two mainwheels are in line astern under the fuselage, with a smaller wheel on each wing]]\n\n==== Detachable landing gear ====\nSome aircraft use wheels for [[takeoff]] and then jettison them soon afterwards for improved aerodynamic streamlining without the complexity, weight and space requirements of a retraction mechanism. In these cases, the wheels to be jettisoned are sometimes mounted onto axles that are part of a separate \"dolly\" (for main wheels only) or \"trolley\" (for a three-wheel set with a nosewheel) chassis. Landing is then accomplished on skids or similar other simple devices.\n\nHistorical examples include the \"dolly\"-using [[Messerschmitt Me 163]] rocket fighter,<ref name=\"ME163\">{{cite web|url = http://www.aviation.technomuses.ca/collections/artifacts/aircraft/MesserschmittMe163B-1aKomet/|title = Messerschmitt Me 163B-1a Komet|accessdate = 13 May 2012|last = [[Canada Aviation and Space Museum]]|date = n.d.}}</ref> the [[Messerschmitt Me 321]] ''Gigant'' troop glider, and the first eight \"trolley\"-using prototypes<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwiivehicles.com/germany/aircraft/bomber/arado-ar-234-bomber/arado-ar-234-a-blitz-bomber-01.png |title=Arado Ar 234 \u2013 The Flight Deck \u2013 The Hangar \u2013 WW II Bomers |date= |work= |publisher=http://flight-deck.forumotion.com |accessdate=October 7, 2012}}</ref> of the [[Arado Ar 234]] jet reconnaissance bomber.  The main disadvantage to using the takeoff dolly/trolley and landing skid(s) system on German World War II aircraft \u2014 intended for a sizable number of late-war German jet and rocket-powered military aircraft designs \u2014 was that aircraft would likely be scattered all over a military airfield after they had landed from a mission, and would be unable to taxi on their own to an appropriately hidden \"dispersal\" location, which could easily leave them vulnerable to being shot up by attacking [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] fighters.  A related contemporary example are the wingtip support wheels (\"Pogos\") on the [[Lockheed U-2]] reconnaissance aircraft, which fall away after take-off and drop to earth; the aircraft then relies on titanium skids on the wingtips for landing.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n==== Helicopters ====\nTubular landing skids are often used by helicopters to save weight and complexity, as well as to allow the mounting of floatation devices. However, the danger of [[ground resonance]] may require dampers so touchdown shocks or jolts are not transmitted to the main rotor system.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n==== Rearwards and sideways retraction ====\nSome main landing gear struts on World War II aircraft, in order to allow a single-leg main gear to more efficiently store the wheel within either the wing or an engine nacelle, rotated the single gear strut through a 90\u00b0 angle during the rearwards-retraction sequence to allow the main wheel to rest \"flat\" above the lower end of the main gear strut, or flush within the wing or engine nacelles, when fully retracted. Examples are the [[Curtiss P-40]], [[Vought F4U Corsair]], [[Grumman F6F Hellcat]], [[Messerschmitt Me 210]] and [[Junkers Ju 88]]. The [[Aero Commander (aircraft)|Aero Commander]] family of twin-engined business aircraft also shares this feature on the main gears, which retract aft into the ends of the engine [[nacelle]]s. The rearward-retracting nosewheel strut on the [[Heinkel He 219]] and the forward-retracting nose gear strut on the later [[Cessna Skymaster]] similarly rotated 90 degrees as they retracted.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n[[File:Republic P- 47D Thunderbolt ExCC.jpg|thumb|left|A Royal Air Force [[P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]] with its raked-forward main gear, and rearward-angled main wheel position (when retracted) indicated by the just-visible open wheel door.]]\n[[File:B-36 tracked gear edit.jpg|thumb|left|Experimental tracked gear on a [[B-36 Peacemaker]]]]\n\nOn most World War II single-engined fighter aircraft (and even one [[Heinkel He 177#Undercarriage|German heavy bomber design]]) with sideways retracting main gear, the main gear that retracted into the wings was meant to be raked forward, towards the aircraft's nose in the \"down\" position for better ground handling, with a retracted position that placed the main wheels at some angle \"behind\" the main gear's attachment point to the airframe  \u2013 this led to a complex angular geometry for setting up the angles for the retraction mechanism's axis of rotation, with some aircraft, like the [[P-47 Thunderbolt]] and [[Grumman F8F Bearcat#Design and development|Grumman Bearcat]], even mandating that the main gear struts lengthen as they were extended down from the wings to assure proper ground clearance for their large four-bladed propellers. One exception to the need for this complexity in many WW II fighter aircraft was Japan's famous [[Mitsubishi A6M|Zero]] fighter, whose main gear stayed at a perpendicular angle to the centerline of the aircraft when extended, as seen from the side.\n\n==== Tandem layout ====\nAn unusual undercarriage configuration is found on the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, which has two mainwheels in line astern under the fuselage (called a bicycle or ''[[tandem]]'' layout) and a smaller wheel near the tip of each wing.  On second generation Harriers, the wing is extended past the outrigger wheels to allow greater wing-mounted munition loads to be carried.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nA multiple tandem layout was used on some military [[jet aircraft]] during the 1950s, pioneered by the [[Martin XB-51]], and later used on such aircraft as the U-2, [[Myasishchev M-4]], [[Yakovlev Yak-25]], [[Yakovlev Yak-28|Yak-28]] and the [[B-47 Stratojet]] because it allows room for a large internal bay between the main wheels.  A variation of the multi tandem layout is also used on the [[B-52 Stratofortress]] which has four main wheel bogies (two forward and two aft) underneath the fuselage and a small outrigger wheel supporting each wing-tip.  The B-52's landing gear is also unique in that all four pairs of main wheels can be steered. This allows the landing gear to line up with the runway and thus makes [[crosswind landing]]s easier (using a technique called ''[[crab landing]]'').  The challenge of designing a tandem-gear layout is that the aircraft has to sit (on the ground) at the optimum flight angle for landing \u2013 when the plane is nearly in a stalled attitude just before touchdown, both fore and aft wheels must be ready to contact the runway.  Otherwise there will be a vicious jolt as the higher wheel falls to the runway at the stall.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n==== Early shock absorption ====\n[[File:CNAM-IMG 0625.jpg|thumb|The \"castoring\" main gear arrangement on a [[Bl\u00e9riot XI]]]]\n\nOne very early undercarriage arrangement that passively allowed for castoring during crosswind landings, unlike the \"active\" arrangement on the B-52, was pioneered on the [[Bleriot VIII]] design of 1908. It was later used in the much more famous Bl\u00e9riot XI Channel-crossing aircraft of 1909 and also copied in the earliest examples of the [[Etrich Taube]]. In this arrangement the main landing gear's shock absorption was taken up by a vertically sliding bungee cord-sprung upper member. The vertical post along which the upper member slid to take landing shocks also had its lower end as the rotation point for the forward end of the main wheel's suspension fork, allowing the main gear to pivot on moderate crosswind landings.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n==== \"Kneeling\" gear ====\nSome early [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[jet fighter]]s were equipped with \u201ckneeling\u201d nose gear consisting of small steerable auxiliary wheels on short struts located forward of the primary nose gear, allowing the aircraft to be taxied tail-high with the primary nose gear retracted. This feature was intended to enhance safety aboard [[aircraft carrier]]s by redirecting the hot exhaust blast upwards, and to reduce hangar space requirements by enabling the aircraft to be parked with its nose underneath the tail of a similarly equipped jet. Kneeling gear was used on the [[North American FJ-1 Fury]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://yanksair.com/Products/127/110/North-American-NA-141-Fury-FJ-1/ |title=North American NA-141 Fury (FJ-1) |website= |publisher=Yanks Air Museum |access-date=23 January 2016 |quote=}}</ref> and on early versions of the [[McDonnell F2H Banshee]], but was found to be of little use operationally, and was not used on later Navy fighters.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mesko |first=Jim |date=2002 |title=FH Phantom/F2H Banshee in action. |url= |location=Carrollton, Texas, USA |publisher=Squadron/Signal Publications, Inc. |page=12 |isbn=0-89747-444-9}}</ref>\n\nThe nosewheel gear systems of some large cargo jets, like the [[Antonov An-124 Ruslan#Development|Antonov An-124]] ''Condor'', kneel to assist in loading and unloading of cargo using ramps through the forward, \"tilt-up\" hinged fuselage nose while stationary on the ground.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==== Folding gear ====\nIn order to save precious space, various folding and splayable landing gear designs have been created.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n==== Light aircraft ====\nFor light aircraft a type of landing gear which is economical to produce is a simple wooden arch laminated from ash, as used on some homebuilt aircraft. A similar arched gear is often formed from spring steel. The [[Cessna 165|Cessna Airmaster]] was among the first aircraft to use spring steel landing gear. The main advantage of such gear is that no other shock-absorbing device is needed; the deflecting leaf provides the shock absorption.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n==== Monowheel ====\n[[File:Schleicher Ka 6e.jpg|right|thumb|A Schleicher Ka 6e glider shows its monowheel landing gear]]\nTo minimize drag, modern [[Glider (sailplane)|gliders]] most usually have a single wheel, retractable or fixed, centered under the fuselage, which is referred to as ''monowheel gear'' or ''monowheel landing gear''. Monowheel gear is also used on some powered aircraft, where drag reduction is a priority, such as the [[Europa XS]]. Much like the Me 163 rocket fighter, some gliders from prior to the [[Second World War]] used a take-off dolly that was jettisoned on take-off and then landed on a fixed skid.<ref name=\"Europa\">{{Cite web |title=Europa XS Monowheel Overview |url=http://www.europa-aircraft.co.uk/monowheel/| publisher=Europa Aircraft Ltd. |year = 2011|accessdate=13 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Ground carriage ===\nFinally, the idea behind a [[ground carriage]] is to leave the landing gear on the runway entirely in order to reduce weight.[[File:undercarriage.b747.arp.jpg|thumb|Wing and fuselage undercarriages on a [[Boeing 747-400]], shortly before landing]]\n\n===Steering===\nThere are several types of steering. [[Taildragger]] aircraft may be steered by [[rudder]] alone (depending upon the [[prop wash]] produced by the aircraft to turn it) with a freely pivoting tail wheel, or by a steering linkage with the tail wheel, or by ''differential braking'' (the use of independent brakes on opposite sides of the aircraft to turn the aircraft by slowing one side more sharply than the other).  Aircraft with tricycle landing gear usually have a steering linkage with the nosewheel (especially in large aircraft), but some allow the nosewheel to pivot freely and use differential braking and/or the rudder to steer the aircraft, like the [[Cirrus SR22]].\n\nSome aircraft require that the pilot steer by using rudder pedals; others allow steering with the yoke or control stick.  Some allow both.  Still others have a separate control, called a ''[[tiller]]'', used for steering on the ground exclusively.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n[[File:Wheel skis.jpg|thumb|left|Wheel-skis]]\n\n====Rudder steering====\nWhen an aircraft is steered on the ground exclusively using the rudder, turning the plane requires that a substantial airflow be moving past the rudder, which can be generated either by the forward motion of the aircraft or by thrust provided by the engines.  Rudder steering requires considerable practice to use effectively.  Although it requires air movement, it has the advantage of being independent of the landing gear, which makes it useful for aircraft equipped with fixed floats or skis.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n====Direct steering====\n[[File:MM00756-4.jpg|thumb|left|The nose gear steering-wheel ([[tiller]]) is visible as a semi-circular wheel to the left of the yoke in this photo of a Boeing 727 cockpit]]\nSome aircraft link the yoke, control stick, or rudder directly to the wheel used for steering.  Manipulating these controls turns the steering wheel (the nose wheel for [[tricycle landing gear]], and the tail wheel for [[taildragger]]s).  The connection may be a firm one in which any movement of the controls turns the steering wheel (and vice versa), or it may be a soft one in which a spring-like mechanism twists the steering wheel but does not force it to turn.  The former provides positive steering but makes it easier to skid the steering wheel; the latter provides softer steering (making it easy to overcontrol) but reduces the probability of skidding.  Aircraft with retractable gear may disable the steering mechanism wholly or partially when the gear is retracted.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n====Differential braking====\nDifferential braking depends on asymmetric application of the brakes on the main gear wheels to turn the aircraft.  For this, the aircraft must be equipped with separate controls for the right and left brakes (usually on the rudder pedals).  The nose or tail wheel usually is not equipped with brakes.  Differential braking requires considerable skill.  In aircraft with several methods of steering that include differential braking, differential braking may be avoided because of the wear it puts on the braking mechanisms.  Differential braking has the advantage of being largely independent of any movement or skidding of the nose or tailwheel.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n====Tiller steering====\nA tiller in an aircraft is a small wheel or lever, sometimes accessible to one pilot and sometimes duplicated for both pilots, that controls the steering of the aircraft while it is on the ground. The tiller may be designed to work in combination with other controls such as the rudder or yoke.  In large airliners, for example, the tiller is often used as the sole means of steering during taxi, and then the rudder is used to steer during takeoff and landing, so that both aerodynamic control surfaces and the landing gear can be controlled simultaneously when the aircraft is moving at aerodynamic speeds.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n===Tires and wheels===\n[[File:Two man replace a main landing gear tire of a plane.jpg|thumb|Two mechanics replacing a main landing gear wheel on a [[Lockheed P-3 Orion]]]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-668-7162-06A, Flugzeug Heinkel He 177, Fahrgestell.jpg|thumb|right|[[Luftwaffe]] groundcrew servicing an [[Heinkel He 177|He 177A]]'s main-gear wheels and tires, February 1944]]\nThe number of [[Tire#Aircraft|tires]] required for a given aircraft design gross weight is largely determined by the flotation characteristics.

Braking will also become less effective due to a reduction in the frictional force between the tires and the ground. In addition, the decrease in the size of the tire, and hence the size of the wheel, could pose a problem if internal brakes are to be fitted inside the wheel rims. The arguments against higher pressure are of such a nature that commercial operators generally prefer the lower pressures in order to maximize tire life and minimize runway stress. To prevent punctures from stones Phillipine Airlines had to operate their [[Hawker Siddeley 748]] aircraft with pressures as low as the tire manufacturer would permit.<ref name=blackman>\"Test Pilot\" Tony Blackman, Grub Street Publishing 2009, ISBN 9781906502362, p.177</ref> However, too low a pressure can lead to an accident as in the [[Nigeria Airways Flight 2120]].\n\nA rough general rule for required tire pressure is given by the manufacturer in their catalog. Goodyear for example advises the pressure to be 4% higher than required for a given weight or as fraction of the rated static load and inflation.<ref name=Goodyear>[http://www.goodyearaviation.com/resources/] Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Retrieved: 26 January 2012.</ref>\n\nTires of many commercial aircraft are required to be filled with [[nitrogen]] or low-oxygen air to prevent the internal combustion of the tire which may result from overheating brakes producing volatile hydrocarbons from the tire lining.<ref name=FAA_Ruling>[http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFinalRule.nsf/a09133bddc7f4fbb8525646000609712/e18b9cadcf1a66da86256a3100713354!OpenDocument] FAA Ruling: \"Use of Nitrogen or Other Inert Gas for Tire inflation in Lieu of Air\" Docket No. 26147 Amendment No. 25-78 RIN 2120-AD87</ref>\n\n===Landing gear and accidents===\n[[File:JetBlue292Landing.jpg|thumb|[[JetBlue Airways Flight 292]], an Airbus A320, making an emergency landing on runway 25L at LAX in 2005 after the front landing gear malfunctioned]]\nMalfunctions or human errors (or a combination of these) related to retractable landing gear have been the cause of numerous accidents and incidents throughout aviation history.  Distraction and preoccupation during the landing sequence played a prominent role in the approximately 100 gear-up landing incidents that occurred each year in the United States between 1998 and 2003.<ref>{{cite journal | author=The Office of the NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System | title=Gear Up Checkup | journal=Call Back ASRS | publisher=NASA | volume=  | issue=292 | pages= | doi= |date=January 2004  | url=http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/docs/cb/cb_292.pdf | accessdate=1 April 2012}}</ref>  A gear-up landing incident, also known as a [[belly landing]], is an accident that may result from the pilot simply forgetting, or failing, to lower the landing gear before landing or a mechanical malfunction that does not allow the landing gear to be lowered.  Although rarely fatal, a gear-up landing is very expensive, as it causes massive airframe damage. If the landing results in a [[prop strike]], a complete engine rebuild may also be required.  Many aircraft between the wars \u2013 at the time when retractable gear was becoming commonplace \u2013 were deliberately designed to allow the bottom of the wheels to protrude below the fuselage even when retracted to reduce the damage caused if the pilot forgot to extend the landing gear or in case the plane was shot down and forced to crash-land.  Examples include the [[Avro Anson]], Boeing [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] and the [[Douglas DC-3]].  The modern-day [[A-10 Thunderbolt II|Fairchild-Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II]] carries on this legacy: it is similarly designed in an effort to avoid (further) damage during a gear-up landing, a possible consequence of battle damage.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nSome aircraft have a stiffened fuselage bottom or added firm structures, designed to minimize structural damage in a wheels-up landing.  When the [[Cessna Skymaster]] was converted for a military spotting role (the [[O-2 Skymaster]]), [[fiberglass]] railings were added to the length of the fuselage; they were adequate to support the aircraft without damage if it was landed on a grassy surface.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nThe [[Bombardier Dash 8]] is notorious for its landing gear problems. There were three incidents involved, all of them involving [[Scandinavian Airlines]], flights [[Dash 8 landing gear incidents|SK1209, SK2478, and SK2867]]. This led to Scandinavian retiring all of its Dash 8s. The cause of these incidents was a locking mechanism that failed to work properly. This also caused concern for the aircraft for many other airlines that found similar problems, [[Bombardier Aerospace]] ordered all Dash 8s with 10,000 or more hours to be grounded, it was soon found that 19 [[Horizon Air]]lines Dash 8s had locking mechanism problems, so did 8 [[Austrian Airlines]] planes, this did cause several hundred flights to be canceled.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nOn September 21, 2005, [[JetBlue Airways Flight 292]] successfully landed with its nose gear turned 90 degrees sideways, resulting in a shower of sparks and flame after touchdown.  This type of incident is very uncommon as the nose [[Shock absorber#Types of shock absorbers|oleo strut]]s are designed with centering cams to hold the nosewheels straight until they are compressed by the weight of the aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nOn November 1, 2011, [[LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16|LOT Polish Airlines Flight LO16]] successfully belly landed at [[Warsaw Chopin Airport]] due to technical failures; all 231 people on board escaped without injury.<ref name=apvmsnbc>{{cite news|last=Scislowska|first=Monika|title=Warsaw airport back to work after plane emergency |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45149697/ns/travel-news/#.TrLb1GCIZQE|accessdate=13 January 2012 | work=MSNBC|date=3 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Emergency extension systems====\nIn the event of a failure of the aircraft's landing gear extension mechanism a backup is provided.
