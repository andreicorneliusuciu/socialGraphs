Under their neck, they have a ruff which has black bars resembling a bow tie although this is often not visible.\n\nBody colour varies from medium brown to goldish to beige-white, and is occasionally marked with dark brown spots, especially on the limbs. All species of lynx have white fur on their chests, bellies and on the insides of their legs, fur which is an extension of the chest and belly fur. The lynx's colouring, fur length and paw size vary according to the climate in their range.  In the [[Southwestern United States]], they are short-haired, dark in colour and their paws are smaller and less padded. As climates get colder and more northerly, lynx have progressively thicker fur, lighter colour, and their paws are larger and more padded to adapt to the snow. Their paws may be larger than a human hand or foot.\n\nThe smallest species are the [[bobcat]] and the [[Canada lynx]], while the largest is the [[Eurasian lynx]], with considerable variations within species.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Physical characteristics of ''Lynx'' species\n!

It is native to [[Europe]]an and [[Siberia]]n forests. While its [[conservation status]] has been classified as \"[[least concern]]\", populations of Eurasian lynx have been reduced or [[local extinction|extirpated]] from Europe, where it is now being reintroduced.\n\nThe Eurasian lynx is the third largest predator in [[Europe]] after the [[brown bear]] and the [[grey wolf]]. It is a strict [[carnivore]], consuming about one or two kilograms of meat every day.  The Eurasian lynx is one of the widest-ranging, and is found in forests of Europe, Russia, and Central Asia.<ref name=\"BBC Nature Wildlife: Eurasian Lynx\">{{cite book |title=BBC Nature: Eurasian Lynx |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Eurasian_Lynx |publisher=BBC |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-01-03}}</ref>\n\nDuring the summer, the Eurasian lynx has a relatively short, reddish or brown coat which is replaced by a much thicker silver-grey to greyish-brown coat during winter.<!--WCoW--> The lynx hunts by stalking and jumping its prey, helped by the rugged, forested country in which it resides. A favorite prey for the lynx in its woodland habitat is [[roe deer]].

Its coat is variable, though generally tan to grayish brown, with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail. The ears are black-tipped and pointed, with short, black tufts. There is generally an off-white color on the lips, chin, and underparts. Bobcats in the desert regions of the southwest have the lightest-colored coats, while those in the northern, forested regions have the darkest.<ref name=\"cah\" />\n\n== Behavior and diet ==\nThe lynx is usually solitary, although a small group of lynx may travel and hunt together occasionally. Mating takes place in the late winter and once a year the female gives birth to between one and four kittens. The gestation time of the lynx is about 70 days. The young stay with the mother for one more winter, a total of around nine months, before moving out to live on their own as young adults. The lynx creates its den in crevices or under ledges. It feeds on a wide range of animals from [[white-tailed deer]], [[reindeer]], [[roe deer]], small [[red deer]], and [[chamois]], to smaller, more usual prey: [[snowshoe hare]]s, [[fish]], [[fox]]es, [[sheep]], [[squirrel]]s, [[mouse|mice]], [[Turkey (bird)|turkeys]] and other [[bird]]s, and [[goat]]s. It also eats [[lagopus|ptarmigans]], [[vole]]s, and [[grouse]].\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n[[File:Stalking Lynx (5516764719).jpg|250px|thumbnail|A lynx stalking prey]]\nThe lynx inhabits high altitude forests with dense cover of shrubs, reeds, and tall grass. Although this cat hunts on the ground, it can climb trees and can swim swiftly, catching fish.\n\n=== Europe and Asia ===\nThe [[Eurasian lynx]] ranges from central and northern [[Europe]] across [[Asia]] up to Northern [[Pakistan]] and [[India]]. In [[Iran]], they live in [[Mount Damavand]] area.<ref>\"Iran Environmental and Wild life Watch\" http://www.iew.ir/1392/10/21/20008</ref> Since the beginning of the 20th century, the Eurasian lynx was considered extinct in the wild in [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]]. A resettlement project, begun in 1973, has successfully reintroduced lynx to the Slovenian Alps and the Croatian regions of Gorski Kotar and Velebit, including Croatia's [[Plitvice Lakes National Park]] and [[Risnjak National Park]]. In both countries, the lynx is listed as an endangered species and protected by law.\n\nSeveral lynx resettlement projects begun in the 1970s have been successful in various regions of [[Switzerland]]. Since the 1990s, there have been numerous efforts to resettle the Eurasian lynx in [[Germany]], and since  2000, a small population can now be found in the [[Harz]] mountains near [[Bad Lauterberg]].\n\nThe lynx is found in the [[Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest]] in northeastern [[Poland]], in [[Estonia]] and in the northern and western parts of China, particularly the [[Tibetan Plateau]]. In [[Romania]], the numbers exceed 2,000, the largest population in Europe outside of [[Russia]], although most experts consider the official population numbers to be overestimated.<ref name=\"KORA\">{{cite web |title=Status and conservation of the Eurasian Lynx (Lynx lynx) in Europe in 2001 |format=PDF [17.09 Mb] |publisher=Coordinated research projects for the conservation and management of carnivores in Switzerland (KORA) |url=http://www.kora.ch/fileadmin/file_sharing/5_Bibliothek/52_KORA_Publikationen/520_KORA_Berichte/KORA_19_E_Lynx_Survey_Europe_part_1_Intro.pdf |accessdate=2014-01-08}}</ref>\n\nThe lynx is more common in northern Europe, especially in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], and the northern parts of [[Russia]].
