It accumulates the input quantity over a defined time to produce a representative output.\n\nIntegration is an important part of many [[engineering]] and [[science|scientific]] applications. Mechanical integrators are the oldest application, and are still used in such  as metering of water flow or electric power. Electronic analogue integrators are the basis of [[analog computer]]s and charge amplifiers. Integration is also performed by digital computing algorithms.\n\n==In signal processing circuits==\n[[File:Op-Amp Integrating Amplifier.svg|400px|thumbnail|right|A circuit diagram of an integrating amplifier made using an operational amplifier.]]\n:''See also [[Operational amplifier applications#Integration and differentiation|Integrator at op amp applications]]''\n\nAn [[electronics|electronic]] integrator is a form of first-order [[low-pass filter]], which can be performed in the continuous-time (analog) domain or approximated (simulated) in the discrete-time (digital) domain. An integrator will have a low pass filtering effect but when given an offset it will accumulate a value building it until it reaches a limit of the system or overflows.\n\nA ''voltage integrator'' is an electronic device performing a time integration of an electric voltage, thus measuring the total volt-second product.\n\nA ''current integrator'' is an electronic device performing a time integration of an [[electric current]], thus measuring a total [[electric charge]]. A [[charge amplifier]] is an example of current integrator. A current integrator is also used to measure the electric charge on a [[Faraday cup]] in a [[residual gas analyzer]] to measure partial pressures of gasses in a vacuum. Another application of current integration is in [[ion beam deposition]], where the measured charge directly corresponds to the number of ions deposited on a substrate, assuming the charge state of the [[ion]]s is known. The two current-carrying electrical leads must to be connected to the [[ion source]] and the substrate, closing the [[electrical network|electric circuit]] which in part is given by the ion beam.\n\n==In software==\n{{main article|Numerical integration}}\nIntegrators may also be software components.\n\nIn some [[computational physics]] [[computer simulation]]s, such as [[numerical weather prediction]], [[molecular dynamics]], [[flight simulator]]s, [[reservoir simulation]], [[noise barrier]] design, [[architectural acoustics]], and [[electronic circuit simulation]], an integrator is a numerical method for integrating trajectories from forces (and thereby accelerations) that are only calculated at discrete time steps.\n\n==Mechanical integrators==\n{{Main article|Differential analyser}}\n\nMechanical integrators were key elements in the mechanical [[differential analyser]], used to solve practical physical problems.  Mechanical integration mechanisms were also used in control systems such as regulating flows or temperature in industrial processes.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Differentiator]]\n*[[Digital differential analyzer]]\n*[[Fractional-order integrator]]\n*[[Integrating ADC]]\n*[[Lowpass filter]]\n*[[Operational amplifier]]\n*[[Planimeter]]\n*[[Signal processing]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Unreferenced|date=December 2008}}\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wolframalpha.com/calculators/integral-calculator/ Wolfram Online Integrator]\n*[http://calc.matthen.com Calc.Matthen Online Integrator, can do definite integrals]\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yDef8POEwIQC&pg=PA85|title=Transistor Circuits for Spacecraft Power System|author=Keng C.
