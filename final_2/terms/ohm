Although several empirically derived standard units for expressing electrical resistance were developed in connection with early telegraphy practice, the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] proposed a unit derived from existing units of mass, length and time and of a convenient size for practical work as early as 1861. The definition of the ohm was revised several times. Today the definition of the ohm is expressed from the [[quantum Hall effect]].\n\n== Definition ==\n[[File:Electronic multi meter.jpg|thumb|A [[multimeter]] can be used to measure resistance in ohms, among other things.]]\n\nThe ohm is defined as an electrical resistance between two points of a conductor when a constant potential difference of 1 [[volt]], applied to these points, produces in the conductor a current of 1 [[ampere]], the conductor not being the seat of any [[electromotive force]].<ref>[http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf BIPM SI Brochure: Appendix 1, p. 144]</ref>\n\n<math>\\Omega = \\dfrac{\\mbox{V}}{\\mbox{A}} = \\dfrac{\\mbox{1}}{\\mbox{S}} = \\dfrac{\\mbox{W}}{\\mbox{A}^2} = \\dfrac{\\mbox{V}^2}{\\mbox{W}} = \\dfrac{\\mbox{s}}{\\mbox{F}} = \\dfrac{\\mbox{J} \\cdot \\mbox{s}}{\\mbox{C}^2} = \\dfrac{\\mbox{kg} \\cdot \\mbox{m}^2}{\\mbox{s} \\cdot \\mbox{C}^2} = \\dfrac{\\mbox{J}}{\\mbox{s} \\cdot \\mbox{A}^2}=\\dfrac{\\mbox{kg}\\cdot\\mbox{m}^2}{\\mbox{s}^3 \\cdot \\mbox{A}^2}</math>\n\nin which the following units appear: [[volt]] (V), [[ampere]] (A), [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] (S), [[watt]] (W), [[second]] (s), [[farad]] (F), [[joule]] (J), [[kilogram]] (kg), [[metre]] (m), and [[coulomb]] (C).\n\nIn many cases the resistance of a conductor in ohms is approximately constant within a certain range of voltages, temperatures, and other parameters. These are called [[linear]] [[resistor]]s. In other cases resistance varies (e.g., [[thermistor]]s).\n\nCommonly used multiples and submultiples in electrical and electronic usage are the microohm, milliohm, kilohm, megohm, and gigaohm;<ref>The [http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec09.html ''NIST Guide to the SI: 9.3 Spelling unit names with prefixes''] reports that IEEE/ASTM SI 10-2002 ''IEEE/ASTM Standard for Use of the International System of Units (SI): The Modern Metric System'' states that there are three cases in which the final vowel of an SI prefix is commonly omitted: '''megohm''', '''kilohm''', and '''hectare'''. \"In all other cases in which the unit name begins with a vowel, both the final vowel of the prefix and the vowel of the unit name are retained and both are pronounced.\"</ref> the term \"gigohm\", though not official, is in common use for the latter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/gigohm |title=gigohm: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-16}}</ref>\n\nIn alternating current circuits, [[electrical impedance]] is also measured in ohms (\u03a9).\n\n== Conversions ==\nThe [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] (symbol: S) is the [[SI derived unit]] of [[electric conductance]] and [[admittance]], also known as the [[mho]] (ohm spelled backwards, symbol is \u2127); it is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of resistance in ohms (\u03a9).\n\n== Power as a function of resistance ==\nThe power dissipated by a [[resistor]] may be calculated from its resistance, and the voltage or current involved. The formula is a combination of [[Ohm's Law]] and [[Joule's first law|Joule's law]]:\n:<math>P=V\\cdot I =\\frac{V^2}{R} = I^2\\cdot R</math>\n\nwhere:\n:P = power in [[watt]]s\n:R = resistance in ohms\n:V = [[voltage]] across the resistor\n:I = current through the resistor in [[ampere|amps]]\n\nA linear resistor has a constant resistance value over all applied voltages or currents; many practical resistors are linear over a useful range of currents. Non-linear resistors have a value that may vary depending on the applied voltage (or current). Where [[alternating current]] is applied to the circuit,(or where the resistance value is a function of time), the relation above is true at any instant but calculation of average power over an interval of time will require [[integral|integration]] of \"instantaneous\" power over that interval.\n\n== History ==\nThe rapid rise of electrotechnology in the last half of the 19th century created a demand for a rational, coherent, consistent, and international system of units for electrical quantities. Telegraphers and other early users of electricity in the 19th century needed a practical standard unit of measurement for resistance. Resistance was often expressed as a multiple of the resistance of a standard length of telegraph wires; different agencies used different bases for a standard, so units were not readily interchangeable. Electrical units so defined were not a coherent system with the units for energy, mass, length, and time, requiring conversion factors to be used in calculations relating energy or power to resistance.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Bruce J|title=The Ohm Is Where the Art Is: British Telegraph Engineers and the Development of Electrical Standards|journal=Osiris|year=1994|volume=9|series=2nd|pages=48\u201363|url=https://webspace.utexas.edu/huntbj/1994-Ohm-Osiris.pdf|accessdate=27 February 2014|doi=10.1086/368729}}</ref>\n\nTwo different methods of establishing a system of electrical units can be chosen. Various artifacts, such as a length of wire or a standard [[electrochemical]] cell, could be specified as producing defined quantities for resistance, voltage, and so on. Alternatively, the electrical units can be related to the mechanical units by defining, for example, a unit of current that gives a specified force between two wires, or a unit of charge that gives a unit of force between two unit charges. This latter method ensures coherence with the units of energy. Defining a unit for resistance that is coherent with units of energy and time in effect also requires defining units for potential and current. It is desirable that one unit of electrical potential will force one unit of electric current through one unit of electrical resistance, doing one unit of work in one unit of time, otherwise all electrical calculations will require conversion factors.\n\nSince so-called \"absolute\" units of charge and current are expressed as combinations of units of mass, length, and time, [[dimensional analysis]] of the relations between potential, current, and resistance show that resistance is expressed in units of length per time \u2014 a velocity. Some early definitions of a unit of resistance, for example, defined a unit resistance as one quadrant of the Earth per second.\n\nThe absolute-units system related magnetic and electrostatic quantities to metric base units of mass, time, and length. These units had the great advantage of simplifying the equations used in the solution of electromagnetic problems, and eliminated conversion factors in calculations about electrical quantities. However, the CGS units turned out to have impractical sizes for practical measurements.\n\nVarious artifact standards were proposed as the definition of the unit of resistance. In 1860 [[Werner Siemens]] (1816\u20131892) published a suggestion for a reproducible resistance standard in [[Johann Christian Poggendorff|Poggendorffs]] [[Annalen der Physik und Chemie]].<ref>{{citation|last1=Werner Siemens |periodical=Annalen der Physik und Chemie|title=Vorschlag eines reproducirbaren Widerstandsmaa\u00dfes |volume=186|issue=5|year=1860|pages=1\u201320|language=German|doi=10.1002/andp.18601860502}}</ref> He proposed a column of pure mercury, of one square millimetre cross section, one metre long: [[Siemens mercury unit]]. However, this unit was not coherent with other units. One proposal was to devise a unit based on a mercury column that would be coherent \u2013 in effect, adjusting the length to make the resistance one ohm. Not all users of units had the resources to carry out metrology experiments to the required precision, so working standards notionally based on the physical definition were required.\n\nIn 1861, [[Josiah Latimer Clark|Latimer Clark]] (1822\u20131898) and [[Charles Tilston Bright|Sir Charles Bright]] (1832\u20131888) presented a paper at the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] meeting <ref>{{cite journal\n|first1=Latimer|last1=Clark|author1-link=Josiah Latimer Clark\n|first2=Sir Charles|last2=Bright |author2-link=Charles Tilston Bright\n|title=Measurement of Electrical Quantities and Resistance|journal=[[The Electrician]]|date=1861-11-09|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3\u20134|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7BdbAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref> suggesting that standards for electrical units be established and suggesting names for these units derived from eminent philosophers, 'Ohma', 'Farad' and 'Volt'.

The error was significant for preparation of working standards.\n\nOn September 21, 1881 the ''[[Congr\u00e8s internationale d'\u00e9lectriciens]]'' (international conference of electricians) defined a ''practical'' unit of Ohm for the resistance, based on CGS units, using a mercury column at zero deg. Celsius, similar to the apparatus suggested by Siemens.\n\nA ''legal'' ohm, a reproducible standard, was defined by the international conference of electricians at Paris in 1884 as the resistance of a mercury column of specified weight and 106&nbsp;cm long; this was a compromise value between the B. A. unit (equivalent to 104.7&nbsp;cm), the Siemens unit (100&nbsp;cm by definition), and the CGS unit. Although called \"legal\", this standard was not adopted by any national legislation. The \"international\" ohm was defined as a mercury column 106.3&nbsp;cm long of mass 14.4521 grams and 0&nbsp;\u00b0C at the International Electrical Conference 1893 in Chicago. This definition became the basis for the legal definition of the ohm in several countries. In 1908, the next Electrical Conference confirmed this definition. The mercury column standard was maintained until the 1948 [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]], at which the ohm was redefined in absolute terms instead of as an artifact standard.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, units were well-understood and consistent. Definitions would change with little effect on commercial uses of the units. Advances in metrology allowed definitions to be formulated with a high degree of precision and repeatability.\n\n=== Historical units of resistance ===\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n! align=left | Unit<ref>Gordon Wigan (trans. and ed.), ''Electrician's Pocket Book'', Cassel and Company, London, 1884</ref>\n! align=left | Definition\n! align=left | Value in B.A. ohms\n! align=left | Remarks\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n| Absolute foot/second x 10<sup>7</sup>\n| using Imperial units\n| .3048\n| considered obsolete even in 1884\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n| Thomson's unit\n| using Imperial units\n| .3202\n| 100 million feet/second, considered obsolete even in 1884\n\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n| Jacobi copper unit\n| A specified copper wire 25 feet long weighing 345 grains\n| .6367\n| Used in 1850s\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n| Weber's absolute unit \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup>\n| Based on the metre and the second\n| 0.9191\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n| [[Siemens mercury unit]]\n| 1860.

Various resistance coils were constructed by the British Association and others, to serve as physical artifact standards for the unit of resistance. The long-term stability and reproducibility of these artifacts was an ongoing field of research, as the effects of temperature, air pressure, humidity, and time on the standards were detected and analyzed.\n\nArtifact standards are still used, but [[metrology]] experiments relating accurately-dimensioned inductors and capacitors provided a more fundamental basis for the definition of the ohm. Since 1990 the [[quantum Hall effect]] has been used to define the ohm with high precision and repeatability. The quantum Hall experiments are used to check the stability of working standards that have convenient values for comparison.<ref>R.

As W represents the [[watt]], the SI unit of [[power (physics)|power]], this can lead to confusion.\n\nIn the electronics industry it is common to use the character R instead of the \u03a9 symbol, thus, a 10 \u03a9 resistor may be represented as 10R. This is the British standard [[BS 1852]] code. It is used in many instances where the value has a decimal place. For example, 5.6 \u03a9 is listed as 5R6. This method avoids overlooking the decimal period, which may not be rendered reliably on components or when duplicating documents.\n\nIn documents printed before WWII the unit symbol often consisted of the raised lowercase omega (\u03c9), such that 56 \u03a9 was written as 56<sup>\u03c9</sup>.\n\n[[Unicode]] encodes the symbol as {{unichar|2126|ohm sign}}, distinct from Greek omega among [[letterlike symbols]], but it is only included for backwards compatibility and the Greek uppercase omega character {{unichar|03A9|GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA|html=}} is preferred.<ref>Excerpts from ''[http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0/ch07.pdf#search=%22character%20U%2B2126%20maps%20OR%20map%20OR%20mapping%22 The Unicode Standard, Version 4.0]'', accessed 11 October 2006</ref> In DOS and Windows, the [[alt code]] ALT 234 may produce the \u03a9 symbol.
