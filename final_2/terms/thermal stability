This is the amount of work needed to transform the water body (e.g. a lake) to a uniform water density. The Schmidt stability 'S' is commonly measured in [[Joule]] per square meter or g*cm/cm. Compare [[Stratification (water)|Stratification]].\n\" thermal stability can also be defined as the no change at micro-structural level.\"\n\n== References ==\n{{Unreferenced|date=January 2009}}\n<references />\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|title=Engineering Tribology|author=Gwidon W.
