The fundamental is at 220 Hz (A3).]]\n\nThe '''sawtooth wave''' (or '''saw wave''') is a kind of [[non-sinusoidal waveform]]. It is so named based on its resemblance to the teeth of a [[saw]].\n\nThe convention is that a sawtooth wave ramps upward and then sharply drops. However, in a \"reverse (or inverse) sawtooth wave\", the wave ramps downward and then sharply rises. It can also be considered the extreme case of an asymmetric [[triangle wave]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FourierSeriesTriangleWave.html |title=Fourier Series-Triangle Wave - from Wolfram MathWorld |publisher=Mathworld.wolfram.com |date=2012-07-02 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}</ref>\n\nThe [[piecewise linear function]]\n\n:<math>x(t) = t - \\lfloor t \\rfloor = t - \\operatorname{floor}(t)</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>x(t) = t   (mod  \\ 1)</math>\n\nbased on the [[floor function]] of time ''t'' is an example of a sawtooth wave with [[Wave period|period]] 1.\n\nA more general form, in the range \u22121 to 1, and with period ''a'', is \n\n:<math>x(t) = 2 \\left( {t \\over a} - \\left\\lfloor {1 \\over 2} + {t \\over a}\\right\\rfloor \\right)</math>\n:<math>= 2 \\left( {t \\over a} - \\operatorname{floor} \\left( {1 \\over 2} + {t \\over a} \\right) \\right)</math>\n\nThis sawtooth function has the same [[Phase (waves)|phase]] as the sine function.\n\nAnother function in trigonometric terms with period ''p'' and amplitude ''a'':\n\n:<math>y(x) = -\\frac{2a}{\\pi}\\arctan \\left( \\cot \\left(\\frac{x \\pi}{p} \\right) \\right)</math>\n\nWhile a square wave is constructed from only odd harmonics, a sawtooth wave's sound is harsh and clear and its spectrum contains both even and odd [[harmonic]]s of the [[fundamental frequency]]. Because it contains all the integer harmonics, it is one of the best waveforms to use for [[subtractive synthesis]] of musical sounds, particularly bowed string instruments like violins and cellos, since the [[Stick-slip phenomenon|slip-stick behavior]] of the bow drives the strings with a sawtooth-like motion.<ref>http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/mth192/pages/html/music.pdf page 42</ref>\n\n{{Listen|filename=Additive_220Hz_Sawtooth_Wave.wav|title=Additive Sawtooth Demo|description=220Hz Sawtooth wave created by harmonics added every second over sine wave.|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nA sawtooth can be constructed using [[additive synthesis]].

This summation can generally be more efficiently calculated with a [[fast Fourier transform]].  If the waveform is digitally created directly in the time domain using a non-[[bandlimited]] form, such as y = x - [[Floor function|floor]](x), infinite harmonics are sampled and the resulting tone contains [[aliasing]] distortion.\n\n[[File:Synthesis sawtooth.gif|thumb|350px|right|Animation of the additive synthesis of a sawtooth wave with an increasing number of harmonics]]\n\nAn audio demonstration of a sawtooth played at [[440 Hz]] (A4) and 880&nbsp;Hz (A5) and 1760&nbsp;Hz (A6) is available below.

The sawtooth and square waves are among the most common waveforms used to create sounds with subtractive [[subtractive synthesis|analog]] and [[virtual analog]] music synthesizers.\n* The sawtooth wave is the form of the vertical and horizontal [[Deflection (physics)|deflection]] signals used to generate a [[raster graphics|raster]] on [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]-based television or monitor screens. [[Oscilloscope]]s also use a sawtooth wave for their horizontal deflection, though they typically use [[electrostatic]] deflection. \n** On the wave's \"ramp\", the magnetic field produced by the deflection yoke drags the [[electron]] beam across the face of the CRT, creating a [[scan line]].\n** On the wave's \"cliff\", the magnetic field suddenly collapses, causing the electron beam to return to its resting position as quickly as possible.\n** The voltage applied to the deflection yoke is adjusted by various means (transformers, capacitors, center-tapped windings) so that the half-way voltage on the sawtooth's cliff is at the zero mark, meaning that a negative voltage will cause deflection in one direction, and a positive voltage deflection in the other; thus, a center-mounted deflection yoke can use the whole screen area to depict a trace. Frequency is 15.734&nbsp;kHz on [[NTSC]], 15.625&nbsp;kHz for [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]]).\n** The vertical deflection system operates the same way as the horizontal, though at a much lower frequency (59.94&nbsp;Hz on [[NTSC]], 50&nbsp;Hz for PAL and SECAM).\n** The ramp portion of the wave must appear as a straight line. If otherwise, it indicates that the voltage isn't increasing linearly, and therefore that the magnetic field produced by the deflection yoke is not linear. As a result, the electron beam will accelerate during the non-linear portions. This would result in a television image \"squished\" in the direction of the non-linearity. Extreme cases will show marked brightness increases, since the electron beam spends more time on that side of the picture. \n** The first television receivers had controls allowing users to adjust the picture's vertical or horizontal linearity. Such controls were not present on later sets as the stability of electronic components had improved.\n\n== See also ==\n[[File:Waveforms.svg|thumb|400px|[[sine wave|Sine]], [[square wave|square]], [[triangle wave|triangle]], and sawtooth waveforms]]\n\n* [[List of periodic functions]]\n* [[Sine wave]]\n* [[Sound]]\n* [[Square wave]]\n* [[Triangle wave]]\n* [[Wave]]\n* [[Zigzag]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite book | author=Hugh L.
