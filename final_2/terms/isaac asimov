His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of ''[[The Naked Sun]]''. He began publishing nonfiction in 1952, co-authoring a college-level textbook called ''Biochemistry and Human Metabolism''. Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite [[Sputnik I]] by the USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly [[popular science]] books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he wrote only four science fiction novels. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series. There are, however, many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Prelude to Foundation |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1988 |pages=xiii\u2013xv |nopp=true |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nAsimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his \"[[Three Laws of Robotics]]\" and the [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]] (see ''Yours, Isaac Asimov,'' p.&nbsp;329). Furthermore, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits his science fiction for introducing the words '[[positronic brain|positronic]]' (an entirely fictional technology), '[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]' (which is also used for a [[Psychohistory|different study]] on historical motivations) and '[[robotics]]' into the English language. Asimov coined the term 'robotics' without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], but for [[robot]]s. Unlike his word 'psychohistory', the word 'robotics' continues in mainstream technical use with Asimov's original definition. ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' featured [[android (robot)|androids]] with \"[[positronic brain]]s\" and one episode, ''[[Datalore]]'', credits Asimov with conceiving this fictional technology.<ref>{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#series12 |title=Is Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation an Asimovian robot? |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref><!-- Not \"inventing\".

In the mid-1930s he came into contact with [[science fiction fandom]], particularly the circle that became the [[Futurians]]. He began writing his first science fiction story, \"Cosmic Corkscrew\", in 1937; finished it on June 19, 1938, inspired by a visit to the offices of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]''; and personally submitted it to ''Astounding'' editor [[John W. Campbell]] two days later. Campbell rejected \"Cosmic Corkscrew\", but encouraged Asimov to keep trying, and Asimov did. In October, he sold the third story he finished,<!--source does not cover that part--> \"[[Marooned Off Vesta]]\", to ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', then a monthly sci-fi magazine edited by [[Raymond A. Palmer]], and it appeared in the March 1939 issue.<ref name=isfdb /> Two more of his stories appeared that year, \"The Weapon Too Dreadful to Use\" in the May ''Amazing'' and \"Trends\" in the July ''Astounding''.<ref name=isfdb /> For 1940, [[ISFDB]] catalogs seven stories in four different pulp magazines, including one in ''Astounding''.<ref name=isfdb />\n\nIn September 1941, ''Astounding'' published the 32nd story Asimov wrote, \"[[Nightfall (Asimov short story)|Nightfall]]\", which has been described as one of \"the most famous science-fiction stories of all time\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bewilderingstories.com/issue8/asimov.html |title=Isaac Asimov: The Good Doctor |accessdate=May 13, 2007 |last=Spud |first=The Invincible |work=Bewildering Stories article}}</ref> In 1968 the Science Fiction Writers of America voted \"Nightfall\" the best science fiction short story ever written.<ref name=obit /> In his short story collection ''[[Nightfall and Other Stories]]'', he wrote, \"The writing of 'Nightfall' was a watershed in my professional career..... I was suddenly taken seriously and the world of science fiction became aware that I existed. As the years passed, in fact, it became evident that I had written a 'classic'.\"<ref>Asimov, I. ''Nightfall and Other Stories''  (1969)  (Grafton Books 1991 edition, pp. 9-10)</ref>\n\n\"Nightfall\" is an archetypal example of [[social science fiction]], a term coined by Asimov to describe a new trend in the 1940s, led by authors including Asimov and [[Robert A.

Taken together, they are his most famous work of science fiction, along with the [[Isaac Asimov's Robot Series|''Robot ''series]]. In 1966 they won the [[Hugo Award]] for the all-time best series of science fiction novels.<ref>[http://www.nesfa.org/data/LL/Hugos/hugos1966.html The Long List of Hugo Awards, 1966] at nesfa.org (retrieved 24 April 2016).</ref> Many years later, due to pressure by fans on Asimov to write another,<ref name=\"wiredforbooks\" /> he continued the series with ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'' (1982) and ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' (1986), and then went back to before the original trilogy with ''[[Prelude to Foundation]]'' (1988) and ''[[Forward the Foundation]]'' (1992). The series features his fictional science of [[Psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]], in which the future course of the history of large populations can be predicted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/cole_11_12/ |title=Clarkesworld Magazine - Science Fiction & Fantasy |work=Clarkesworld Magazine}}</ref>\n\nHis [[positronic robot]] stories\u2014many of which were collected in ''[[I, Robot]]'' (1950)\u2014were begun at about the same time. They promulgated a set of rules of [[ethics]] for robots (see [[Three Laws of Robotics]]) and intelligent machines that greatly influenced other writers and thinkers in their treatment of the subject. Asimov notes in his introduction to the short story collection ''[[The Complete Robot]]'' (1982) that he was largely inspired by the almost relentless tendency of robots up to that time to fall consistently into a Frankenstein plot in which they destroyed their creators.\n\nThe robot series has led to film adaptations. With Asimov's collaboration, in about 1977 [[Harlan Ellison]] wrote a screenplay of ''I, Robot'' that Asimov hoped would lead to \"the first really adult, complex, worthwhile [[science fiction film]] ever made\". The screenplay has never been filmed and was eventually published in book form in 1994. The 2004 movie ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', starring [[Will Smith]], was based on an unrelated script by [[Jeff Vintar]] titled ''Hardwired'', with Asimov's ideas incorporated later after the rights to Asimov's title were acquired.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/bottom/56.html |title=The Bottom of Things |first=Michael |last=Sampson |date=January 14, 2004 |accessdate=January 17, 2007}}</ref> (Ironically, the title was not original to Asimov but had previously been used for [[I, Robot (short story)|a story]] by [[Eando Binder]].) Also, one of Asimov's robot short stories, \"[[The Bicentennial Man]]\", was expanded into a novel ''[[The Positronic Man]]'' by Asimov and [[Robert Silverberg]], and this was adapted into the 1999 movie ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'', starring [[Robin Williams]].<ref name=\"theguardian.com\" />\n\nBesides movies, his [[The Foundation Series|''Foundation'']] and [[Isaac Asimov's Robot Series|''Robot'']] stories have inspired other derivative works of science fiction literature, many by well-known and established authors such as [[Roger MacBride Allen]], [[Greg Bear]], [[Gregory Benford]], [[David Brin]], and [[Donald Kingsbury]]. At least some of these appear to have been done with the blessing of, or at the request of, Asimov's widow, [[Janet Asimov]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pe.cgi?4327 |title=Series: Isaac Asimov's Robot Mysteries |publisher=ISFDB |accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pe.cgi?3792 |title=Series: Second Foundation Trilogy |publisher=ISFDB |accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?26941 |title=Publication: Psychohistorical Crisis |publisher=ISFDB |accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, he also wrote a [[False document|spoof chemistry article]], \"[[Thiotimoline|The Endochronic Properties of Resublimated Thiotimoline]]\". At the time, Asimov was preparing his own doctoral [[dissertation]], and for the oral examination to follow that. Fearing a prejudicial reaction from his graduate school evaluation board at [[Columbia University]], Asimov asked his editor that it be released under a pseudonym, yet it appeared under his own name. During his oral examination shortly thereafter, Asimov grew concerned at the scrutiny he received. At the end of the examination, one evaluator turned to him, smiling, and said, \"What can you tell us, Mr. Asimov, about the thermodynamic properties of the compound known as thiotimoline\". The hysterically laughing Asimov was then led out of the room. After a five-minute or so wait, he was summoned back into the Examination Room and congratulated as \"Dr. Asimov\".<ref>''The Early Asimov, Volume 3'' p. 119</ref>\n\nIn 1949, the book publisher [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]'s science fiction editor Walter I. Bradbury accepted Asimov's unpublished [[Novella|novelette]] \"Grow Old Along With Me\" (40,000 words) for publication, but requested that it be extended to a full novel of 70,000 words. The book appeared under the Doubleday imprint in January 1950 with the title of ''[[Pebble in the Sky]]''.<ref>''The Early Asimov, Volume 3'' p. 186</ref> The Doubleday company went on to publish five more original science fiction novels by Asimov in the 1950s, along with the six juvenile [[Lucky Starr series|Lucky Starr novels]], the latter under the pseudonym of \"Paul French\".<ref>''In Memory Yet Green'' p. 627</ref> Doubleday also published collections of Asimov's short stories, beginning with ''[[The Martian Way and Other Stories]]'' in 1955. The early 1950s also saw the [[Gnome Press]] company publishing one collection of Asimov's positronic robot stories as ''[[I, Robot]]'' and his ''[[The Foundation Series|Foundation]]'' stories and novelettes as the three books of the ''Foundation trilogy''. More positronic robot stories were republished in book form as ''[[The Rest of the Robots]]''.\n\nWhen new science fiction magazines, notably ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]'' magazine and ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'', appeared in the 1950s, Asimov began publishing short stories in them as well. He would later refer to the 1950s as his \"golden decade\". A number of these stories are included in his ''[[The Best of Isaac Asimov|Best of]]'' anthology, including \"[[The Last Question]]\" (1956), on the ability of humankind to cope with and potentially reverse the process of [[entropy]]. It was his personal favorite and considered by many to be equal to \"[[Nightfall (Asimov short story)|Nightfall]]\". Asimov wrote of it in 1973:\n\n{{quote|Why is it my favorite? For one thing I got the idea all at once and didn't have to fiddle with it; and I wrote it in white-heat and scarcely had to change a word. This sort of thing endears any story to any writer.\n\nThen, too, it has had the strangest effect on my readers. Frequently someone writes to ask me if I can give them the name of a story, which they 'think' I may have written, and tell them where to find it. They don't remember the title but when they describe the story it is invariably \"The Last Question\". This has reached the point where I recently received a long-distance phone call from a desperate man who began, 'Dr. Asimov, there's a story I think you wrote, whose title I can't remember\u2014' at which point I interrupted to tell him it was \"The Last Question\" and when I described the plot it proved to be indeed the story he was after. I left him convinced I could read minds at a distance of a thousand miles.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Best of Isaac Asimov |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1973 |publisher=Sphere |isbn=0-7221-1254-8}}</ref>}}\n\nIn December 1974, former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[Paul McCartney]] approached Asimov and asked him if he could write the screenplay for a science-fiction movie musical. McCartney had a vague idea for the plot and a small scrap of dialogue; he wished to make a film about a rock band whose members discover they are being impersonated by a group of extraterrestrials. The band and their impostors would likely be played by McCartney's group [[Wings (band)|Wings]], then at the height of their career. Intrigued by the idea, although he was not generally a fan of rock music, Asimov quickly produced a \"treatment\" or brief outline of the story. He adhered to McCartney's overall idea, producing a story he felt to be moving and dramatic. However, he did not make use of McCartney's brief scrap of dialogue, and probably as a consequence, McCartney rejected the story. The treatment now exists only in the Boston University archives.<ref>Asimov, I. (1980) ''In Joy Still Felt'' Avon, p. 693</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1977, Asimov lent his name to ''[[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine]]'' (now ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'') and penned an editorial for each issue. There was also a short-lived ''[[Asimov's SF Adventure Magazine]]'' and a companion ''Asimov's Science Fiction Anthology'' reprint series, published as magazines (in the same manner as the stablemates ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine]]'s'' and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine]]'s'' \"anthologies\").<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' pp. 428-429</ref>\n\n=== Popular science ===\nDuring the late 1950s and 1960s, Asimov shifted gears somewhat, and substantially decreased his fiction output (he published only four adult novels between 1957's ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' and 1982's ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'', two of which were mysteries). At the same time, he greatly increased his nonfiction production, writing mostly on science topics; the launch of [[Sputnik]] in 1957 engendered public concern over a \"science gap\", which Asimov's publishers were eager to fill with as much material as he could write.<ref>{{cite book |title=I. Asimov: A Memoir |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=Bantam |location=New York |isbn=0-553-56997-X |pages=252\u2013254}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the monthly ''[[Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'' invited him to continue his regular nonfiction column, begun in the now-folded bimonthly companion magazine ''[[Venture Science Fiction Magazine]]'', ostensibly dedicated to [[popular science]], but with Asimov having complete editorial freedom. The first of the ''F&SF'' columns appeared in November 1958, and they followed uninterrupted thereafter, with 399 entries, until Asimov's terminal illness. These columns, periodically collected into books by his principal publisher, [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], helped make Asimov's reputation as a \"Great Explainer\" of science, and were referred to by him as his only pop-science writing in which he never had to assume complete ignorance of the subjects at hand on the part of his readers. His first wide-ranging reference work, ''[[The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science]]'' (1960), was nominated for a [[National Book Award]]. The popularity of his science books and the income he derived from them also allowed him to give up most of his academic responsibilities and become essentially a full-time [[freelance writer]].<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' chapter 65.</ref>\n\nAsimov wrote several essays on the social contentions of his time, including \"Thinking About Thinking\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=January 1975 |title=Thinking About Thinking |magazine=The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction |location=New York |publisher=Mercury Press, Inc.}}</ref> and \"Science: Knock Plastic\".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=November 1967 |title=Knock Plastic! |magazine=The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction |location=New York |publisher=Mercury Press, Inc.}}</ref>\n\nThe great variety of information covered in Asimov's writings once prompted [[Kurt Vonnegut]] to ask, \"How does it feel to know everything?\" Asimov replied that he only knew how it felt to have the 'reputation' of omniscience\u2014\"Uneasy\".<ref>Asimov, I. ''[[In Joy Still Felt]]'' (Doubleday, 1980) chapter 30.</ref>\n\nThe feelings of friendship and respect between Asimov and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] were demonstrated by the so-called \"Clarke-Asimov Treaty of [[Park Avenue]]\", put together as they shared a cab ride in New York. This stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself), while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/books/isaac-asimov-faq/part3/ |title=Isaac Asimov FAQ, Part 3, 5.5 |date=February 9, 2001 |accessdate=January 17, 2007}}</ref> Thus, the dedication in Clarke's book ''Report on Planet Three'' (1972) reads: \"In accordance with the terms of the Clarke-Asimov treaty, the second-best science writer dedicates this book to the second-best science-fiction writer.\"\n\n==== Coined terms ====\nAsimov coined the term \"[[robotics]]\" in his 1941 story \"[[Liar!

While acknowledging the Oxford Dictionary reference, he incorrectly states that the word was first printed about one-third of the way down the first column of page 100, ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]'', March 1942 printing of his short story \"[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=Gold |publisher=Voyager <!-- was Eos --> |date=1996 <!-- was 2003 --> |origyear=1995 |location=London |isbn=0-00-648202-3 |pages=224\u2013225 |chapter=The Robot Chronicles}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=[[Counting the Eons]] |chapter=4 The Word I Invented |publisher=Doubleday |date=1983 |quote=Robotics has become a sufficiently well developed technology to warrant articles and books on its history and I have watched this in amazement, and in some disbelief, because I invented ..... the word}}</ref>\n\nAsimov also coined the term \"[[spome]]\" in a paper entitled, \"There's No Place Like Spome\" in ''Atmosphere in Space Cabins and Closed Environments'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.locusmag.com/index/yr2000/s3.htm |title=Atmosphere in Space Cabins and Closed Environments |publisher=Locusmag.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref> originally presented as a paper to the American Chemical Society on September 13, 1965. It refers to any system closed with respect to matter and open with respect to energy capable of sustaining human life indefinitely.\n\nAsimov coined the term \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" in his [[Foundation series|''Foundation'']] stories to name a fictional branch of science which combines [[history]], [[sociology]], and [[mathematical statistics]] to make general predictions about the future behavior of very large groups of people, such as the [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]]. It was first introduced in the five short stories (1942\u20131944) which would later be collected as the 1951 novel ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Psychohistory |journal=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=4\u20138 |publisher=Davis Publications |date=July 1988 |issn=0162-2188}}</ref> Somewhat later, the term \"[[psychohistory]]\" was applied by others to research of the effects of psychology on history.\n\n=== Other writings ===\n[[File:Weird Tales September 1950.jpg|thumb|right|The novelette \"Legal Rites\", a collaboration with [[Frederik Pohl]], was the only Asimov story to appear in ''[[Weird Tales]]'']]\nIn addition to his interest in science, Asimov was also greatly interested in history. Starting in the 1960s, he wrote 14 popular history books, including ''The Greeks: A Great Adventure'' (1965),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Greeks: A Great Adventure |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1965 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Republic'' (1966),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Republic |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1966 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Empire'' (1967),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Empire |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Egyptians'' (1967)<ref>{{cite book |title=The Egyptians |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> and ''The Near East: 10,000 Years of History'' (1968).\n<ref>{{cite book |title=The Near East: 10,000 Years of History |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1968 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref>\n\nHe published ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'' in two volumes\u2014covering the [[Old Testament]] in 1967 and the [[New Testament]] in 1969\u2014and then combined them into one 1,300-page volume in 1981. Complete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the Bible in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters. His interest in literature manifested itself in several annotations of literary works, including ''[[Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare]]'' (1970), ''Asimov's Annotated Paradise Lost'' (1974), and ''The Annotated Gulliver's Travels'' (1980).<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' chapter 112</ref>\n\nAsimov was also a noted mystery author and a frequent contributor to ''Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine''. He began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his Wendell Urth stories, but soon moved on to writing \"pure\" mysteries. He published two full-length mystery novels, and wrote 66 stories about the [[Black Widowers]], a group of men who met monthly for dinner, conversation, and a puzzle. He got the idea for the Widowers from his own association in a stag group called the Trap Door Spiders and all of the main characters (with the exception of the waiter, Henry, who he admitted resembled Wodehouse's Jeeves) were modeled after his closest friends.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Puzzles of the Black Widowers |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1991 |pages=xiii\u2013xiii |nopp=true |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nToward the end of his life, Asimov published a series of collections of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]], mostly written by himself, starting with ''[[Lecherous Limericks]]'', which appeared in 1975. ''Limericks: Too Gross'', whose title displays Asimov's love of [[pun]]s, contains 144 limericks by Asimov and an equal number by [[John Ciardi]]. He even created a slim volume of [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlockian]] limericks. Asimov featured [[Yiddish]] humor in ''[[Azazel (Asimov)|Azazel, The Two Centimeter Demon]]''. The two main characters, both Jewish, talk over dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, about anecdotes of \"George\" and his friend Azazel. Asimov's ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on [[Theory of humor|humor theory]]. According to Asimov, the most essential element of humor is an abrupt change in point of view, one that suddenly shifts focus from the important to the trivial, or from the sublime to the ridiculous.<ref name=\"Asimov 1971\">{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1971 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=New York |isbn=0-395-12665-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Asimov 1992\">{{cite book |title=Asimov Laughs Again |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1992 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |isbn=0-06-016826-9}}</ref>\n\nParticularly in his later years, Asimov to some extent cultivated an image of himself as an amiable lecher. In 1971, as a response to the popularity of sexual guidebooks such as ''[[The Sensuous Woman]]'' (by \"J\") and ''[[The Sensuous Man]]'' (by \"M\"), Asimov published ''The Sensuous Dirty Old Man'' under the byline \"Dr. 'A{{'\"}}<ref>''In Joy Still Felt'' p. 569</ref> (although his full name was printed on the paperback edition, first published 1972).\n\nAsimov published [[Autobiographies of Isaac Asimov|three volumes of autobiography]].

Asimov wrote a critical essay on ''Star Trek's'' scientific accuracy for ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine. Roddenberry retorted respectfully with a personal letter explaining the limitations of accuracy when writing a weekly series. Asimov corrected himself with a follow-up essay to ''TV Guide'' claiming that despite its inaccuracies, ''Star Trek'' was a fresh and intellectually challenging [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] show. The two remained friends to the point where Asimov even served as an advisor on a number of ''Star Trek'' projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/getting-star-trek-on-air-was-impossible.html |title=Letters of Note: Getting Star Trek on the air was impossible |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Calendar}}\nIn 1973, Asimov published a proposal for [[calendar reform]], called the World Season Calendar. It divides the year into four seasons (named A\u2013D) of 13 weeks (91 days) each. This allows days to be named, e.g., \"D-73\" instead of December 1 (due to December 1 being the 73rd day of the 4th quarter).

(Retrieved 26 March 2016.)</ref>\n\n== Writing style ==\n\n=== Characteristics ===\nOne of the most common impressions of Asimov's fiction work is that his writing style is extremely unornamented. In 1980, science fiction scholar [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]], professor [[emeritus]] of [[English studies|English]] at the [[University of Kansas]] wrote of ''I, Robot'':\n{{quote|Except for two stories\u2014\"[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]\" and \"[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]\"\u2014they are not stories in which character plays a significant part. Virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action. Nor is there a great deal of local color or description of any kind. The dialogue is, at best, functional and the style is, at best, transparent..... The robot stories and, as a matter of fact, almost all Asimov fiction\u2014play themselves on a relatively bare stage.<ref name=\"IASFM-Gunn\">{{cite news |last=Gunn |first=James | author-link = James Gunn (author) |title=On Variations on a Robot |periodical=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine |date=July 1980 |pages=56\u201381 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>}}\n\nGunn observes places where Asimov's style rises to the demands of the situation; he cites the climax of \"Liar!\" as an example. Sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines: [[Susan Calvin]] in \"Liar!\" and \"Evidence\", [[Arkady Darell]] in ''Second Foundation'', Elijah Baley in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', and [[Hari Seldon]] in the ''Foundation'' prequels. Asimov addresses this criticism at the beginning of his book ''[[Nemesis (Isaac Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'':\n{{quote|I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing\u2014to be 'clear'. I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer prize. I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics\u2014Well, they can do whatever they wish.<ref name=\"Nemesis-Authour's note\">{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Nemesis |date=October 1989 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>}}\n\nOther than books by Gunn and Patrouch, a relative dearth of \"literary\" criticism exists on Asimov (particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output). Cowart and Wymer's ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' (1981) gives a possible reason:\n\n{{quote|His words do not easily lend themselves to traditional [[literary criticism]] because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader, in rather direct terms, what is happening in his stories and why it is happening. In fact, most of the dialogue in an Asimov story, and particularly in the Foundation trilogy, is devoted to such exposition. Stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Literary Biography: Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science Fiction Writers |last=Cowart |first=David |last2=Wymer |first2=Thomas L. |date=1981 |publisher=Gale Research |location=Detroit |pages=15\u201329}}</ref>}}\n\nIn fairness, Gunn's and Patrouch's respective studies of Asimov both take the stand that a clear, direct prose style is still a style. Gunn's 1982 book goes into considerable depth commenting upon each of Asimov's novels published to that date. He does not praise all of Asimov's fiction (nor does Patrouch), but he does call some passages in ''The Caves of Steel'' \"reminiscent of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]\". When discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic New York City, Gunn says that Asimov's prose \"need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-503059-1}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he prided himself on his unornamented prose style (for which he credited [[Clifford D. Simak]] as an early influence), Asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated [[narrative structure]]s, often by arranging chapters in non[[Chronology|chronological]] ways. Some readers have been put off by this, complaining that the [[Nonlinear (arts)|nonlinearity]] is not worth the trouble and adversely affects the clarity of the story. For example, the first third of ''The Gods Themselves'' begins with Chapter 6, then backtracks to fill in earlier material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book121.html |title=Review of ''The Gods Themselves'' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> (John Campbell advised Asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible. This advice helped Asimov create \"[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]\", one of the early ''Robot'' stories. See ''In Memory Yet Green'' for details of that time period.) Patrouch found that the interwoven and nested flashbacks of ''[[The Currents of Space]]'' did serious harm to that novel, to such an extent that only a \"dyed-in-the-[[kyrt]]<ref>Asimov, Isaac (1952), [http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/a/isaac-asimov/currents-of-space.htm ''The Currents of Space''], explanation of \"kyrt\"</ref> Asimov fan\" could enjoy it. Asimov's tendency to contort his timelines is perhaps most apparent in his later novel ''Nemesis'', in which one group of characters lives in the \"present\" and another group starts in the \"past\", beginning 15 years earlier and gradually moving toward the time period of the first group.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n=== Limitations ===\nAsimov was sometimes criticized for the general absence of [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and of [[extraterrestrial life]] in his science fiction. He claimed he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' to respond to these criticisms,<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Joy Still Felt |date=1980 |page=567}}</ref> which often came from [[New Wave science fiction]] (and mostly British) writers. The second part (of three) of the novel is set on an alien world with three sexes, and the sexual behavior of these creatures is extensively depicted.\n\n==== Alien life ====\nAsimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when ''Astounding''{{'}}s editor John Campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans. The nature of the rejection led him to believe that Campbell may have based his bias towards humans in stories on a real-world racial bias. Unwilling to write only weak alien races, and concerned that a confrontation would jeopardize his and Campbell's friendship, he decided he would not write about aliens at all.<ref name=\"Early Asimov\" /> Nevertheless, in response to these criticisms, he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'', which contains aliens and alien sex. The book won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1972,<ref name=\"WWE-1972-2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1972 |title=1972 Award Winners & Nominees |work=Worlds Without End |accessdate=September 2, 2009}}</ref> and the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1973.<ref name=\"WWE-1973\" /> Asimov said that of all his writings, he was most proud of the middle section of ''The Gods Themselves'', the part that deals with those themes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=250 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novella \"[[Gold (Asimov short story)|Gold]]\", Asimov describes an author clearly based on himself who has one of his books (''The Gods Themselves'') adapted into a \"compu-drama\", essentially [[photo-realistic]] [[computer animation]]. The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov (\"Gregory Laborian\") for having an extremely nonvisual style, making it difficult to adapt his work, and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across.<ref>{{cite book |title=Gold |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=HarperPrism |location=New York |isbn=0-06-105206-X |pages=109\u2013138}}</ref>\n\n==== Gender and social issues ====\nOthers have criticized him for a lack of strong female characters in his early work. In his autobiographical writings, such as ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' (\"Women and Science Fiction\"), he acknowledges this and responds by pointing to inexperience. His later novels, written with more female characters but in essentially the same prose style as his early SF stories, brought this matter to a wider audience. For example, the August 25, 1985 ''Washington Post''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Book World\" section reports of ''Robots and Empire'' as follows:\n\n{{quote|In 1940, Asimov's humans were stripped-down masculine portraits of Americans from 1940, and they still are. His robots were tin cans with speedlines like an old [[Studebaker]], and still are; the ''Robot'' tales depended on an increasingly unworkable distinction between movable and unmovable [[artificial intelligence]]s, and still do. In the Asimov universe, because it was conceived a long time ago, and because its author abhors confusion, there are no computers whose impact is worth noting, no social complexities, no [[genetic engineering]], aliens, [[arcologies]], [[multiverses]], [[Clone (genetics)|clones]], sin or sex; his heroes (in this case [[R. Daneel Olivaw]], whom we first met as the robot protagonist of ''The Caves of Steel'' and its sequels), feel no pressure of information, raw or cooked, as the simplest of us do today; they suffer no deformation from the winds of the Asimov future, because it is so deeply and strikingly orderly.}}\n\n''The Naked Sun'' (1957) deals with [[social issue]]s as a core part of its central setting and motivation, depicts genetic engineering in the guise of [[eugenics]] as a fundamental part of that society, and presents the reader with inverted arcologies where a single person is the focal point of the artificial environment, as well as a hero who hails from a \"normal\" [[arcology]] on Earth. Meanwhile, totally artificial birth, although not specifically cloning, is the aim of the leaders of the society, sexual want is the major driving force of the main female character (albeit veiled in 1950s sensibilities), and the entire story is used to make the point that too much order is ultimately a stagnant dead end to be avoided.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n== Views ==\n\n=== Religion ===\nIsaac Asimov was an [[Atheism|atheist]], a [[Humanism|humanist]], and a [[Rationalism|rationalist]].<ref name=\"Popper\">Isaac Asimov, \"The Way of Reason\", in ''In Pursuit of Truth: Essays on the Philosophy of Karl Popper on the Occasion of his 80th Birthday,,'' ed.

Thus, he grew up without strong religious influences, coming to believe that the ''[[Torah]]'' represented [[Jewish mythology|Hebrew mythology]] in the same way that the ''[[Iliad]]'' recorded [[Greek mythology]].<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

This scholarship was a seed for his later authorship and publication of ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'', an analysis of the historic foundations for both the Old and New Testaments. For many years, Asimov called himself an [[atheism|atheist]]; however, he considered the term somewhat inadequate, as it described what he did not believe rather than what he did. Eventually, he described himself as a \"[[Humanism|humanist]]\" and considered that term more practical. He did, however, continue to identify himself as a nonobservant Jew, as stated in his introduction to [[Jack Dann]]'s anthology of Jewish science fiction, ''[[Wandering Stars]]'': \"I attend no services and follow no ritual and have never undergone that curious puberty rite, the [[bar mitzvah]]. It doesn't matter. I am Jewish.\"<ref>\"I make no secret of the fact that I am a non-observant Jew\", Asimov, Isaac. ''Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine'', Volume 15, Issues 10\u201313. p. 8. Davis Publishing, 1991.</ref>\n\nWhen asked in an interview in 1982 if he was an atheist, Asimov replied, \"I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have. Somehow it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic. I finally decided that I'm a creature of emotion as well as of reason. Emotionally I am an atheist. I don't have the evidence to prove that God doesn't exist, but I so strongly suspect he doesn't that I don't want to waste my time.\"<ref>Isaac Asimov on Science and the Bible (Free Inquiry -- Spring 1982)</ref> Likewise he said about religious education: \"I would not be satisfied to have my kids choose to be religious without trying to argue them out of it, just as I would not be satisfied to have them decide to smoke regularly or engage in any other practice I consider detrimental to mind or body.\"<ref>{{Cite web |publisher=Corvallis Secular Society |year=1997 |title=Isaac Asimov on religion |url=http://css.peak.org/newsletter/1997/aug97/asimov.html}}</ref>\n\nIn his last volume of autobiography, Asimov wrote, \"If I were not an atheist, I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words. I think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a TV preacher whose every word is God, God, God, and whose every deed is foul, foul, foul.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

Asimov rejected the idea that a human belief or action could merit infinite punishment. If an afterlife existed, he claimed, the longest and most severe punishment would be reserved for those who \"slandered God by inventing Hell\".<ref>{{cite book |title=I. Asimov: A Memoir |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=Bantam |location=New York |isbn=0-553-56997-X |pages=336\u2013338}}</ref>\n\nAsimov said about using religious motives in his writing: \"I tend to ignore religion in my own stories altogether, except when I absolutely have to have it. ...and, whenever I bring in a religious motif, that religion is bound to be seem vaguely Christian because that is the only religion I know anything about, even though it is not mine. An unsympathetic reader might think that I am \"burlesquing\" Christianity, but I am not. Then too, it is impossible to write science fiction and really ignore religion.\"<ref>{{Cite book |author=Isaac Asimov |title=Gold: The Final Science Fiction Collection |year=1995 |pages=297\u2013302}}</ref>\n\n=== Politics ===\nAsimov became a staunch supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] during the [[New Deal]], and thereafter remained a political [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. He was a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s and in a television interview during the early 1970s he publicly endorsed [[George McGovern]]. He was unhappy about what he considered an \"irrationalist\" viewpoint taken by many radical political activists from the late 1960s and onwards. In his second volume of autobiography, ''In Joy Still Felt'', Asimov recalled meeting the counterculture figure [[Abbie Hoffman]]. Asimov's impression was that the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s' counterculture]] heroes had ridden an emotional wave which, in the end, left them stranded in a \"no-man's land of the spirit\" from which he wondered if they would ever return.<ref name=\"joy\">{{cite book |title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954\u20131978 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1980 |publisher=Doubleday |location=Garden City, New York |isbn=0-385-15544-1}}</ref>\n\nHe vehemently opposed [[Richard Nixon]], considering him \"a crook and a liar\". He followed the unfolding events of Watergate day-to-day, and was pleased when the president was forced to resign. He was dismayed over the pardon extended to Nixon by [[Gerald Ford|his successor]]: \"I was not impressed by the argument that it has spared the nation an ordeal. To my way of thinking, the ordeal was necessary to make certain it would never happen again.\"<ref>Asimov, I. ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Doubleday, 1980) chapter 39</ref>\n\nThough Asimov came from a Jewish family, he appeared to hold an equivocal attitude towards [[Israel]]. In his first autobiography, he indicates his support for the safety of Israel, though remaining careful to insist he is by no means a [[Zionist]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Memory Yet Green |quote=<!--None-->}}</ref> However, in his third autobiography, he clarifies his position by stating his opposition to the creation of a Jewish state, on the grounds that he is opposed to the concept of nation-states in general, and supports the notion of a single humanity. He especially worries about the safety of Israel given that it has been created among hostile neighbours, and that Jews have merely created for themselves another \"Jewish ghetto\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=380 |postscript=<!--None--> |quote=Chapter 130: When Israel was founded in 1948 and all my Jewish friends were jubilant, I was the skeleton at the feast.

Actually, I feel that no human group deserves a \"homeland\" in the usual sense of the word.... I am not a Zionist, then, because I don't believe in nations, and Zionism merely sets up one more nation to trouble the world.}}</ref>\n\n=== Social issues ===\nAsimov considered himself a feminist even before [[Women's Liberation]] became a widespread movement; he argued that the issue of women's rights was closely connected to that of population control. Furthermore, he believed that [[homosexuality]] must be considered a \"moral right\" on population grounds, as must all [[consent]]ing adult sexual activity that does not lead to reproduction.<ref name=\"YIA\" /> He issued many appeals for [[population control]], reflecting a perspective articulated by people from [[Thomas Malthus]] through [[Paul R. Ehrlich]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Moyer's World of Ideas, Part I |url=http://www.pbs.org/moyers/faithandreason/print/pdfs/woi%20asimov1.pdf |work=transcript page 6, 10/17/1988 show |accessdate=31 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1988 interview by [[Bill Moyers]], Asimov proposed [[computer-aided learning]], where people would use computers to find information on subjects in which they were interested.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Moyer's World of Ideas, Part II |url=http://www.pbs.org/moyers/faithandreason/print/pdfs/woi%20asimov2.pdf |work=transcript page 3, 10/17/1988 show |accessdate=31 December 2012}}</ref> He thought this would make learning more interesting, since people would have the freedom to choose what to learn, and would help spread knowledge around the world.

In a letter reprinted in ''Yours, Isaac Asimov'',<ref name=\"YIA\">Asimov, Isaac (1996). ''Yours, Isaac Asimov'', edited by Stanley Asimov. ISBN 0-385-47624-8.</ref> he states that although he would prefer living in \"no danger whatsoever\" than near a nuclear reactor, he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant than in a slum on [[Love Canal]] or near \"a [[Union Carbide]] plant producing [[methyl isocyanate]]\", the latter being a reference to the [[Bhopal disaster]].<ref name=\"YIA\"/>\n\nIn the closing years of his life, Asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in New York City on the shrinking tax base caused by the [[white flight|middle-class flight]] to the suburbs, though he continued to support high taxes on the middle class to pay for social programs. His last nonfiction book, ''[[Our Angry Earth]]'' (1991, co-written with his long-time friend, science fiction author [[Frederik Pohl]]), deals with elements of the environmental crisis such as [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[oil dependence]], [[war]], [[global warming]], and the destruction of the [[ozone layer]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Our Angry Earth |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |last2=Pohl |first2=Frederik |date=1991 |publisher=Tor |location=New York |isbn=0-312-85252-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Dan |date=December 1991 |title=Review: Our Angry Earth |magazine=Locus |location=Oakland |publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref> In response to being presented by [[Bill Moyers]] with the question \"What do you see happening to the idea of dignity to human species if this population growth continues at its present rate?\", Asimov responded:\n\n{{Blockquote|It's going to destroy it all... if you have 20 people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing. You have to set up, you have to set up times for each person, you have to bang at the door, aren't you through yet, and so on. And in the same way, democracy cannot survive overpopulation. Human dignity cannot survive it. Convenience and decency cannot survive it. As you put more and more people onto the world, the value of life not only declines, but it disappears.<ref>{{cite book |last1=editor |first1=Bill Moyers ; Betty Sue Flowers, |title=A world of ideas : conversations with thoughtful men and women about American life today and the ideas shaping our future |date=1989 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |isbn=0-385-26278-7 |page=6 |edition=1st |url=http://www-tc.pbs.org/moyers/faithandreason/print/pdfs/woi%20asimov1.pdf}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Other authors ===\nAsimov stated, both in his autobiography and in several essays, that he enjoyed the writings of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. He paid tribute to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in a \"Black Widowers\" story. (In his letter to Charlotte and Denis Plimmer, who had previously interviewed him for ''Daily Telegraph Magazine'', Tolkien said that he enjoyed the science fiction of Isaac Asimov.)<ref>{{ME-ref|Letters|No. 294}}</ref>\n\nHe admired a number of his contemporaries, in particular fellow science-fiction author and science writer Arthur C. Clarke, with whom he entered into the lighthearted \"Treaty of Park Avenue,\" which stipulated that Clarke was free to refer to himself as the best science fiction writer in the world (Asimov being second-best), provided he admitted that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (Clarke being second-best). He freely acknowledged a number of his fellow writers as superior to himself in talent, saying of [[Harlan Ellison]], \"He is (in my opinion) one of the best writers in the world, far more skilled at the art than I am.\"<ref>''I.

His almost 500 books--which he wrote as a specialist, a knowledgeable authority, or just an excited layman--range over almost all conceivable subjects: the sciences, history, literature, religion, and of course, science fiction.\"  Asimov explained his quest for holistic knowledge:<ref name=\":0\" /><blockquote>\"I found myself doing research on a biochemical topic. In that area of study I obtained my Ph.D., and in no time at all I was teaching biochemistry at a medical school. But even that was too wide a subject. From books to nonfiction, to science, to chemistry, to biochemistry--and not yet enough. The orchard had to be narrowed down further. To do research, I had to find myself a niche within biochemistry, so I began work on nucleic acids... And at about that point, I rebelled! I could not stand the claustrophobia that clamped down upon me. I looked with horror, backward and forward across the years, at a horizon that was narrowing down and narrowing down to so petty a portion of the orchard. What I wanted was all the orchard, or as much of it as I could cover in a lifetime of running... I have never been sorry for my stubborn advance toward generalization. To be sure, I can't wander in detail through all the orchard, any more than anyone else can, no matter how stupidly determined I may be to do so. Life is far too short and the mind is far too limited. But I can float over the orchard as in a balloon.\"</blockquote>\n\n== Television, music, and film appearances ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}\n* ''[[To Tell The Truth]]'', CBS, approximately 1968, playing the \"real\" Isaac Asimov.
