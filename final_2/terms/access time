Access time values are measured only on access attempts that result in successful access. \n* In a [[computer]], it is the time interval between the instant at which an [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]] control unit initiates a call for [[data]] or a request to [[Computer storage|store]] data, and the instant at which delivery of the data is completed or the storage is started.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Memory latency]]\n* [[Latency_(engineering)#Mechanical_latency|Mechanical latency]]\n* [[Rotational latency]]\n* [[Seek time]]\n* [[Comparison of latency and bandwidth]]\n* [[Throughput]]\n* [[Lead time]]\n* [[Process switching latency]]\n* [[Thread switching latency]]\n\n{{FS1037C MS188}}\n\n[[Category:Network access]]"}]}}}}
