The circuit was invented in 1915 by American engineer [[Ralph Hartley]]. The distinguishing feature of the Hartley oscillator is that the tuned circuit consists of a single capacitor in parallel with two inductors in series (or a single tapped inductor), and the [[feedback]] signal needed for oscillation is taken from the center connection of the two inductors.\n\n== History ==\n\n[[Image:Hartley-US-Pat 1,356,763.png|thumb|235px|Original [[patent drawing]]]]\n\nThe Hartley oscillator was invented by Hartley while he was working for the Research Laboratory of the Western Electric Company.  Hartley invented and patented the design in 1915 while overseeing Bell System's transatlantic radiotelephone tests; it was awarded patent number 1,356,763 on October 26, 1920.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patent US1356763: Oscillation-generator|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US1356763.pdf|publisher=United States Office Patent|accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref> Note that the basic schematic shown below labeled \"Common-drain Hartley circuit\" is essentially the same as in the patent drawing, except that the tube is replaced by a J-FET, and that the battery for a negative grid bias is not needed. \n \nIn 1946 Hartley was awarded the IRE medal of honor \"For his early work on oscillating circuits employing triode tubes and likewise for his early recognition and clear exposition of the fundamental relationship between the total amount of information which may be transmitted over a transmission system of limited band-width and the time required.\"<ref>\nRalph V.

The original 1915 version used a [[triode]] as the amplifying device in [[common plate]] (cathode follower) configuration, with three batteries, and separate adjustable coils. The simplified circuit shown to the right uses a [[Junction FET|JFET]] (in [[common-drain]] configuration), an LC tank circuit (here the single winding is tapped) and a single battery. The circuit illustrates the Hartley oscillator operation:{{dubious|Circuit operation|reason=Many subtle problems with description such as JFET gm, Q killing, and lossless elements \"absorbing\" signals off resonance|date=August 2015}}\n\n* the output from the JFET's ''source'' (''emitter'', if a [[Bipolar Junction Transistor|BJT]] had been used; ''cathode'' for a triode) has the same [[phase (waves)|phase]] as the signal at its gate (or base) and roughly the same voltage as its input (which is the voltage across the entire tank circuit), but the ''current is amplified'', i.e. it is acting as a [[Buffer amplifier#Current buffer|current buffer]] or [[VCVS|voltage-controlled voltage-source]].\n* this low impedance output is then fed into the coil tapping, effectively into an [[autotransformer]] that will step up the voltage, requiring a relatively high current (compared with that available at the top of the coil).\n* with the capacitor-coil [[resonance]], all frequencies other than the tuned frequency will tend to be absorbed  (the tank will appear as nearly 0\u03a9 near DC due to the inductor's low [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] at low frequencies, and low again at very high frequencies due to the capacitor); they will also shift the phase of the feedback from the 0\u00b0 needed for oscillation at all but the tuned frequency.\n\nVariations on the simple circuit often include ways to [[Automatic gain control|automatically]] reduce the amplifier gain to maintain a constant output voltage at a level below overload; the simple circuit above will limit the output voltage due to the gate conducting on positive peaks, effectively damping oscillations but not before significant distortion ([[Spurious tone|spurious]] [[harmonics]]) may result. Changing the tapped coil to two separate coils, as in the original patent schematic, still results in a working oscillator but now that the two coils are not [[magnetically coupled]] the inductance, and so frequency, calculation has to be modified (see below), and the explanation of the voltage increase mechanism is more complicated than the autotransformer scenario.\n\nA quite different implementation using a tapped coil in an LC tank feedback arrangement <ref>{{cite web|last1=Coates|first1=Eric|title=The Hartley Oscillator|url=http://www.learnabout-electronics.org/Oscillators/osc21.php|website=Learnabout electronics|accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref> is to employ a common-grid (or common-gate or common-base) amplifier stage, which is still [[non-inverting]] but provides ''voltage gain'' instead of ''current gain''; the coil tapping is still connected to the cathode (or source or emitter), but this is now the (low impedance) input to the amplifier; the split tank circuit is now dropping the impedance from the relatively high output impedance of the plate (or drain or collector).\n\n[[File:Oscillator comparison.svg|thumb|Comparison of Hartley and Colpitts oscillator]]\nThe Hartley oscillator is the dual of the [[Colpitts oscillator]] which uses a voltage divider made of two capacitors rather than two inductors.  Although there is no requirement for there to be mutual coupling between the two coil segments, the circuit is usually implemented using a tapped coil, with the feedback taken from the tap, as shown here. The optimal tapping point (or ratio of coil inductances) depends on the amplifying device used, which may be a [[bipolar junction transistor]], [[FET]], triode, or amplifier of almost any type (non-inverting in this case, although variations of the circuit with an earthed centre-point and feedback from an [[inverting amplifier]] or the collector/drain of a transistor are also common), but a [[junction FET]] (shown) or triode is often employed as a good degree of amplitude stability (and thus [[distortion]] reduction) can be achieved with a simple [[grid leak]] <!-- is grid-leak confusing here? Hope not --> resistor-capacitor combination in series with the gate or grid (see the Scott circuit below) thanks to [[diode]] conduction on signal peaks building up enough [[reverse bias|negative bias]] to limit amplification.\n\n[[Image:Oscillator hartley opamp.svg|thumb|235px|Op-amp version of Hartley oscillator{{dubious|Impractical circuit schematics|date=March 2016}}]]\n\nThe frequency of oscillation is approximately the [[resonant frequency]] of the tank circuit.  If the capacitance of the tank capacitor is ''C'' and the total [[inductance]] of the tapped coil is ''L'' then\n:<math>f =  {1 \\over 2 \\pi \\sqrt {LC}} \\,</math>\nIf two ''uncoupled'' coils of inductance ''L''<sub>1</sub> and ''L''<sub>2</sub> are used then \n:<math>L = L_1 + L_2 \\,</math>\nHowever, if the two coils are magnetically coupled the total inductance will be greater because of [[mutual inductance]] ''k''<ref>Jim McLucas, Hartley oscillator requires no coupled inductors, EDN October 26, 2006 http://www.edn.com/article/CA6343253.html</ref>\n:<math>L = L_1 + L_2 + k \\sqrt{L_1 L_2} \\,</math>\nThe actual oscillation frequency will be slightly lower than given above, because of [[parasitic capacitance]] in the coil and loading by the transistor.\n\nAdvantages of the Hartley oscillator include:\n\n* The frequency may be adjusted using a single variable capacitor, one side of which can be earthed\n* The output amplitude remains constant over the frequency range\n* Either a tapped coil or two fixed inductors are needed, and very few other components\n* Easy to create an accurate fixed-frequency [[crystal oscillator]] variation by replacing the capacitor with a (parallel-resonant) [[quartz crystal]] or replacing the top half of the [[tank circuit]] with a crystal and grid-leak resistor (as in the [[Tri-tet oscillator]]).\n\nDisadvantages include:\n\n* Harmonic-rich output if taken from the amplifier and not directly from the LC circuit (unless amplitude-stabilisation circuitry is employed).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Opto-electronic oscillator]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{Citation\n |first= F.\n |last= Langford-Smith\n |title= [[Radiotron Designer's Handbook]]\n |edition= 4th\n |year= 1952\n |publisher= Amalgamated Wireless Valve Company Pty., Ltd.\n |location= Sydney, Australia\n |isbn=\n |doi=}}\n*{{Citation\n |first= F.
