The filament, heated by passing an [[electric current]] through it, is protected from oxidation with a glass or quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or [[Vacuum|evacuated]]. In a [[halogen lamp]], filament evaporation is prevented by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life. The light bulb is supplied with electric current by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass. Most bulbs are used in a socket which provides mechanical support and electrical connections.\n\nIncandescent bulbs are manufactured in a wide range of sizes, light output, and [[voltage]] ratings, from 1.5 volts to about 300 volts. They require no external regulating equipment, have low [[manufacturing cost]]s, and work equally well on either alternating current or direct current. As a result, the incandescent lamp is widely used in household and commercial lighting, for portable lighting such as table lamps, car [[headlamp]]s, and [[flashlight]]s, and for decorative and advertising lighting.\n\nIncandescent bulbs are much less efficient than most other types of electric lighting; incandescent bulbs convert less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light,<ref name=\"incandescent\">{{cite web |title=The Nature of Light |last=Keefe |first=T.J. |year=2007 |url=http://www.ccri.edu/physics/keefe/light.htm |accessdate=2007-11-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423123823/http://www.ccri.edu/physics/keefe/light.htm |archivedate=2012-04-23}}</ref> with standard light bulbs averaging about 2.2%.<ref>[[Nicola Armaroli]], [[Vincenzo Balzani]], ''Towards an electricity-powered world''.

In 1850, he began working with carbonized paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb. By 1860, he was able to demonstrate a working device but the lack of a good vacuum and an adequate supply of electricity resulted in a short lifetime for the bulb and an inefficient source of light. By the mid-1870s better pumps became available, and Swan returned to his experiments.\n\nWith the help of Charles Stearn, an expert on vacuum pumps, in 1878, Swan developed a method of processing that avoided the early bulb blackening. This received a British Patent in 1880.<ref name=\"Incandescent Electric Lamp Pp 21-25\">Swan K R Sir Joseph Swan and the Invention of the Incandescent Electric Lamp. 1946 Longmans, Green and Co.

Thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current, so they were not commercially practical, although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum, a carbon conductor, and platinum lead-in wires. This bulb lasted about 40 hours.<ref>https://www.wired.com/2009/12/1218joseph-swan-electric-bulb/</ref> Swan then turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament and the means of attaching its ends. He devised a method of treating cotton to produce 'parchmentised thread' in the early 1880s and obtained British Patent 4933 that same year.<ref name=\"Incandescent Electric Lamp Pp 21-25\"/> From this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England.

Some types of lamp, including incandescent and fluorescent, emit less light as they age; this may be an inconvenience, or may reduce effective lifetime due to lamp replacement before total failure. A comparison of incandescent lamp operating cost with other light sources must include illumination requirements, cost of the lamp and labor cost to replace lamps (taking into account effective lamp lifetime), cost of electricity used, effect of lamp operation on heating and air conditioning systems. When used for lighting in houses and commercial buildings, the energy lost to heat can significantly increase the energy required by a building's [[air conditioning]] system.

Contact wires and a base with two (or more) conductors provide electrical connections to the filament. Incandescent light bulbs usually contain a stem or glass mount anchored to the bulb's base that allows the electrical contacts to run through the envelope without air or gas leaks. Small wires embedded in the stem in turn support the filament and its lead wires.\n\nAn electric current heats the filament to typically {{convert|2000|to|3300|K|F}}, well below tungsten's melting point of {{convert|3695|K|F}}. Filament temperatures depend on the filament type, shape, size, and amount of current drawn. The heated filament emits light that approximates a [[black body|continuous spectrum]]. The useful part of the emitted energy is [[visible light]], but most energy is given off as heat in the near-[[infrared]] wavelengths.\n\n[[3-way bulb|Three-way light bulbs]] have two filaments and three conducting contacts in their bases. The filaments share a common ground, and can be lit separately or together. Common wattages include 30\u201370\u2013100, 50\u2013100\u2013150, and 100\u2013200\u2013300, with the first two numbers referring to the individual filaments, and the third giving the combined wattage.\n\nMost light bulbs have either clear or coated glass. The coated glass bulbs have a white powdery substance on the inside called [[kaolin]]. Kaolin, or [[kaolinite]], is a white, chalky clay in a very fine powder form, that is blown in and electrostatically deposited on the interior of the bulb. It diffuses the light emitted from the filament, producing a more gentle and evenly distributed light. Manufacturers may add pigments to the kaolin to adjust the characteristics of the final light emitted from the bulb. Kaolin diffused bulbs are used extensively in interior lighting because of their comparatively gentle light. Other kinds of colored bulbs are also made, including the various colors used for \"party bulbs\", [[Christmas tree]] lights and other decorative lighting. These are created by [[Glass coloring and color marking|coloring the glass]] with a [[dopant]]; which is often a metal like [[cobalt]] (blue) or [[chromium]] (green).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geconsumerandindustrial.com/environmentalinfo/documents/msds/msds_incandescent_lamps.pdf |title=Lamp Material Information Sheet \u2013 Incandescent Lamp|accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref> Neodymium-containing glass is sometimes used to provide a more natural-appearing light.\n\n{| border=\"0\"\n|\n[[File:Incandescent light bulb.svg|280px|center]]\n|\n#Outline of Glass bulb\n#Low pressure inert gas ([[argon]], [[nitrogen]], [[krypton]], [[xenon]])\n#[[Tungsten]] filament\n#Contact wire (goes out of stem)\n#Contact wire (goes into stem)\n#Support wires (one end embedded in stem; conduct no current)\n#Stem (glass mount)\n#Contact wire (goes out of stem)\n#Cap (sleeve)\n#Insulation ([[vitrite]])\n#Electrical contact\n|}\n\nMany arrangements of electrical contacts are used. Large lamps may have a [[Edison screw|screw base]] (one or more contacts at the tip, one at the shell) or a [[Bayonet mount|bayonet base]] (one or more contacts on the base, shell used as a contact or used only as a mechanical support). Some tubular lamps have an electrical contact at either end. Miniature lamps may have a wedge base and wire contacts, and some automotive and special purpose lamps have screw terminals for connection to wires. Contacts in the lamp socket allow the electric current to pass through the base to the filament. Power ratings for incandescent light bulbs range from about 0.1 watt to about 10,000 watts.\n\nThe glass bulb of a general service lamp can reach temperatures between {{convert|200|and|260|C|F}}. Lamps intended for high power operation or used for heating purposes will have envelopes made of hard glass or [[fused quartz]].<ref name=\"GETP110\" />\n{{further|Lightbulb socket}}\n\n===Gas fill===\nThe bulb is filled with an [[inert gas]], to reduce [[evaporation]] of the filament and prevent its [[oxidation]] at a pressure of about {{convert|70|kPa|atm|abbr=on|1}}.<ref name=\"argon1\">[http://www.uigi.com/argon.html uigi.com \u2013 Argon (Ar) Properties, Uses, Applications Argon Gas and Liquid Argon], 2007</ref>\n\nThe role of the gas is to prevent evaporation of the filament, without introducing significant heat losses. For these properties, chemical inertness and high atomic or molecular weight is desirable. The presence of gas molecules knocks the liberated tungsten atoms back to the filament, reducing its evaporation and allowing it to be operated at higher temperature without reducing its life (or, for operating at the same temperature, prolongs the filament life). It however introduces heat losses (and therefore efficiency loss) from the filament, by [[heat conduction]] and [[heat convection]].\n\nEarly lamps, and some small modern lamps used only a vacuum to protect the filament from oxygen. This however increases evaporation of the filament, albeit it eliminates the heat losses.\n\nThe most common fills are:<ref name=\"ChemArtLight\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=eaj8BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA263&dq=tungsten+wire+drawing&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zzfRVI-9F4HqUOX7gfgJ&ved=0CE0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=tungsten%20wire%20drawing&f=false|title=The Chemistry of Artificial Lighting Devices|work=google.cz}}</ref>\n\n* [[Vacuum]], used in small lamps. Provides best thermal insulation of the filament but does not protect against its evaporation. Used also in larger lamps where the outer bulb surface temperature has to be limited.\n* [[Argon]] (93%) and [[nitrogen]] (7%), where argon is used for its inertness, low thermal conductivity and low cost, and the nitrogen is added to increase the breakdown voltage and prevent arcing between parts of the filament<ref name=\"argon1\"/>\n* Nitrogen, used in some higher-power lamps, e.g. projection lamps, and where higher breakdown voltage is needed due to proximity of filament parts or lead-in wires\n* [[Krypton]], which is more advantageous than argon due to its higher atomic weight and lower thermal conductivity (which also allows use of smaller bulbs), but its use is hindered by much higher cost, confining it mostly to smaller-size bulbs.\n* Krypton mixed with [[xenon]], where xenon improves the gas properties further due to its higher atomic weight. Its use is however limited by its very high cost. The improvements by using xenon are modest in comparison to its cost.\n* [[Hydrogen]], in special flashing lamps where rapid filament cooling is required; its high thermal conductivity is exploited here.\n\nThe gas fill must be free of traces of water. In the presence of the hot filament, water reacts with tungsten forming tungsten trioxide and atomic hydrogen. The oxide deposits on the bulb inner surface and reacts with hydrogen, decomposing to metallic tungsten and water. Water then cycles back to the filament. This greatly accelerates the bulb blackening, in comparison with evaporation-only.\n\nThe gas layer close to the filament (called the Langmuir layer) is stagnant, heat transfer occurs only by conduction. Only at some distance does convection occur to carry heat to the bulb envelope.\n\nThe orientation of the filament influences efficiency. Gas flow parallel to the filament, e.g. a vertically oriented bulb with vertical (or axial) filament, reduces convective losses.\n\nThe efficiency of the lamp increases with a larger filament diameter. Thin-filament, low-power bulbs benefit less from a fill gas, so are often only evacuated. In special cases, when rapid cooling of a filament is needed (e.g. in flashing lights), hydrogen gas fill is used.\n\nEarly lightbulbs with carbon filaments also used carbon monoxide, nitrogen, or mercury vapor. Carbon filaments however operate at lower temperatures than tungsten ones, so the effect of the fill gas was not significant as the heat losses offset any benefits.\n\n==Manufacturing==\n[[File:Tantalum light bulb.png|thumb|upright=0.7|Tantalum filament light bulb, 1908, the first metal filament bulb]]\nEarly lamps were laboriously assembled by hand. After automatic machinery was developed the cost of lamps fell.\n\nIn manufacturing the glass bulb, a type of \"ribbon machine\" is used. A continuous ribbon of glass is passed along a conveyor belt, heated in a furnace, and then blown by precisely aligned air nozzles through holes in the conveyor belt into molds. Thus the glass bulbs are created. After the bulbs are blown, and cooled, they are cut off the ribbon machine; a typical machine of this sort produces 50,000 bulbs per hour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/light-bulb |title=Light Bulb: How Products are Made |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914105212/http://www.enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/light-bulb |archivedate=September 14, 2010}}</ref> The filament and its supports are assembled on a glass stem, which is fused to the bulb. The air is pumped out of the bulb, and the evacuation tube in the stem press is sealed by a flame. The bulb is then inserted into the lamp base, and the whole assembly tested.\n\n==Filament==\nThe first successful light bulb filaments were made of [[carbon]] (from carbonized paper or [[bamboo]]). Early carbon filaments had a negative [[Temperature coefficient of resistivity|temperature coefficient of resistance]] \u2014 as they got hotter, their electrical resistance decreased. This made the lamp sensitive to fluctuations in the power supply, since a small increase of voltage would cause the filament to heat up, reducing its resistance and causing it to draw even more power and heat even further. In the \"flashing\" process, carbon filaments were heated by current passing through them while in an evacuated vessel containing hydrocarbon vapor (usually gasoline). The carbon deposited on the filament by this treatment improved the uniformity and strength of filaments as well as their efficiency. A metallized or \"graphitized\" filament was first heated in a high-temperature oven before flashing and lamp assembly. This transformed the carbon into graphite which further strengthened and smoothed the filament. This also changed the filament to have a ''positive'' temperature coefficient, like a metallic conductor, and helped stabilize the lamp's power consumption, temperature and light output against minor variations in supply voltage.\n\nIn 1902, the [[Siemens]] company developed a [[tantalum]] lamp filament. These lamps were more efficient than even graphitized carbon filaments and could operate at higher temperatures. Since tantalum metal has a lower resistivity than carbon, the tantalum lamp filament was quite long and required multiple internal supports. The metal filament had the property of gradually shortening in use; the filaments were installed with large loops that tightened in use. This made lamps in use for several hundred hours quite fragile.<ref>I. C. S. Reference Library Volume 4B, Scranton, [[International Textbook Company]], 1908, no ISBN</ref> Metal filaments had the property of breaking and re-welding, though this would usually decrease resistance and shorten the life of the filament. General Electric bought the rights to use tantalum filaments and produced them in the US until 1913.<ref>{{cite web|title=GE Tantalum Filament 25W of American Design|url=http://www.lamptech.co.uk/Spec%20Sheets/IN%20TA%20GE%2025W.htm|publisher=Museum of Electric Lamp Technology|accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1898 to around 1905, [[osmium]] was also used as a lamp filament in Europe, and the metal was so expensive that used broken lamps could be returned for partial credit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.frognet.net/~ejcov/osmium.html|title=The Osmium Filament Lamp|work=frognet.net}}</ref> It could not be made for 110 V or 220 V so several lamps were wired in series for use on standard voltage circuits.\n\n[[File:Light-Bulb-Filament-engineerguy.ogv|thumb|How a tungsten filament is made]]\nIn 1906, the [[tungsten]] filament was introduced. Tungsten metal was initially not available in a form that allowed it to be drawn into fine wires. Filaments made from sintered tungsten powder were quite fragile. By 1910, a process was developed by [[William D. Coolidge]] at [[General Electric]] for production of a ductile form of tungsten. The process required pressing tungsten powder into bars, then several steps of sintering, swaging, and then wire drawing. It was found that very pure tungsten formed filaments that sagged in use, and that a very small \"doping\" treatment with potassium, silicon, and aluminium oxides at the level of a few hundred parts per million greatly improved the life and durability of the tungsten filaments.<ref name=autogenerated1>Chapter 2 ''The Potassium Secret Behind Tungsten Wire Production''</ref>\n\n===Coiled coil filament===\nTo improve the efficiency of the lamp, the filament usually consists of multiple coils of coiled fine wire, also known as a 'coiled coil'. For a 60-watt 120-volt lamp, the uncoiled length of the tungsten filament is usually {{convert|22.8|in}},<ref name=\"GETP110\" /> and the filament diameter is {{convert|0.0018|in}}. The advantage of the coiled coil is that evaporation of the tungsten filament is at the rate of a tungsten cylinder having a diameter equal to that of the coiled coil. The coiled-coil filament evaporates more slowly than a straight filament of the same surface area and light-emitting power. As a result, the filament can then run hotter, which results in a more efficient light source, while reducing the evaporation so that the filament will last longer than a straight filament at the same temperature.\n\nThere are several different shapes of filament used in lamps, with differing characteristics. Manufacturers designate the types with codes such as C-6, CC-6, C-2V, CC-2V, C-8, CC-88, C-2F, CC-2F, C-Bar, C-Bar-6, C-8I, C-2R, CC-2R, and Axial.\n\n{{stack|\n[[File:filament.jpg|thumb|Filament of a 200-watt incandescent lightbulb highly magnified]]\n[[File:Fused Electrical Filament SEM Stereo 50x.JPG|thumb|Filament of a burnt-out 50-watt incandescent lightbulb in an [[Scanning Electron Microscope|SEM]] in stereoscopic mode, presented as an [[anaglyph image]].{{3d glasses}}]]\n[[File:Fused Electrical Filament SEM Stereo 500x.JPG|thumb|Filament of a 50-watt incandescent lightbulb in an [[Scanning Electron Microscope|SEM]] in stereoscopic mode, presented as an [[anaglyph image]].{{3d glasses}}]]\n}}\n\nElectrical filaments are also used in [[hot cathode]]s of [[fluorescent lamp]]s and [[vacuum tube]]s as a source of [[electron]]s or in vacuum tubes to heat an electron-emitting electrode.\n\n===Reducing filament evaporation===\nOne of the problems of the standard electric light bulb is ''filament notching'' due to evaporation of the filament. Small variations in [[electrical resistivity|resistivity]] along the filament cause \"hot spots\" to form at points of higher resistivity;<ref name=\"Kane2001\"/> a variation of diameter of only 1% will cause a 25% reduction in service life.<ref name=\"GETP110\" /> These hot spots evaporate faster than the rest of the filament, which increases the resistance at that point\u2014this creates a [[positive feedback]] that ends in the familiar tiny gap in an otherwise healthy-looking filament. [[Irving Langmuir]] found that an inert gas, instead of vacuum, would retard evaporation. General service incandescent light bulbs over about 25 watts in rating are now filled with a mixture of mostly [[argon]] and some [[nitrogen]],<ref>John Kaufman (ed.), ''IES Lighting Handbook 1981 Reference Volume'', Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, New York, 1981 ISBN 0-87995-007-2 page 8-6</ref> or sometimes [[krypton]].<ref>Burgin.

At constant pressure and temperature, the thermal conductivity of a gas depends upon the molecular weight of the gas and the cross sectional area of the gas molecules. Higher molecular weight gasses have lower thermal conductivity, because both the molecular weight is higher and also the cross sectional area is higher. [[Xenon]] gas improves efficiency because of its high molecular weight, but is also more expensive, so its use is limited to smaller lamps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://donklipstein.com/xeincand.html#p|title=Premium Fill Gasses|last=Lipstein|first=Don|accessdate=13 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nDuring ordinary operation, the tungsten of the filament evaporates; hotter, more-efficient filaments evaporate faster. Because of this, the lifetime of a filament lamp is a trade-off between efficiency and longevity. The trade-off is typically set to provide a lifetime of several hundred to 2,000 hours for lamps used for general illumination. Theatrical, photographic, and projection lamps may have a useful life of only a few hours, trading life expectancy for high output in a compact form. Long-life general service lamps have lower efficiency but are used where the cost of changing the lamp is high compared to the value of energy used.\n\nIf a light bulb envelope leaks, the hot tungsten filament reacts with air, yielding an aerosol of brown [[tungsten nitride]], brown [[tungsten dioxide]], violet-blue [[tungsten pentoxide]], and yellow [[tungsten trioxide]] that then deposits on the nearby surfaces or the bulb interior.\n\n===Bulb blackening===\nIn a conventional lamp, the evaporated tungsten eventually condenses on the inner surface of the glass envelope, darkening it. For bulbs that contain a vacuum, the darkening is uniform across the entire surface of the envelope. When a filling of inert gas is used, the evaporated tungsten is carried in the thermal convection currents of the gas, depositing preferentially on the uppermost part of the envelope and blackening just that portion of the envelope. An incandescent lamp that gives 93% or less of its initial light output at 75% of its rated life is regarded as unsatisfactory, when tested according to IEC Publication 60064. Light loss is due to filament evaporation and bulb blackening.<ref>IEC 60064 Tungsten filament lamps for domestic and similar general lighting purposes.</ref> Study of the problem of bulb blackening led to the discovery of the [[thermionic emission|Edison effect, thermionic emission]] and invention of the [[vacuum tube]].\n\nA very small amount of water vapor inside a light bulb can significantly affect lamp darkening. Water vapor [[thermolysis|dissociates]] into hydrogen and oxygen at the hot filament. The oxygen attacks the tungsten metal, and the resulting tungsten oxide particles travel to cooler parts of the lamp. Hydrogen from water vapor reduces the oxide, reforming water vapor and continuing this ''water cycle''.<ref name=\"Kane2001\"/> The equivalent of a drop of water distributed over 500,000 lamps will significantly increase darkening.<ref name=\"GETP110\" /> Small amounts of substances such as [[zirconium]] are placed within the lamp as a [[getter]] to react with any oxygen that may bake out of the lamp components during operation.\n\nSome old, high-powered lamps used in theater, projection, searchlight, and lighthouse service with heavy, sturdy filaments contained loose tungsten powder within the envelope. From time to time, the operator would remove the bulb and shake it, allowing the tungsten powder to scrub off most of the tungsten that had condensed on the interior of the envelope, removing the blackening and brightening the lamp again.<ref>John Kaufman (ed.), ''IES Lighting Handbook 1981 Reference Volume'', Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, New York, 1981 ISBN 0-87995-007-2 page 8-10</ref>\n\n===Halogen lamps===\n[[File:Tungsten filament in halogen lamp.JPG|thumb|Close-up of a tungsten filament inside a [[halogen lamp]]. The two ring-shaped structures left and right are filament supports.]]\n{{Main|Halogen lamp}}\n\nThe [[halogen lamp]] reduces uneven evaporation of the filament and eliminates darkening of the envelope by filling the lamp with a [[halogen]] gas at low pressure, rather than an inert gas. The [[halogen cycle]] increases the lifetime of the bulb and prevents its darkening by redepositing tungsten from the inside of the bulb back onto the filament. The halogen lamp can operate its filament at a higher temperature than a standard gas filled lamp of similar power without loss of operating life. Such bulbs are much smaller than normal incandescent bulbs, and are widely used where intense illumination is needed in a limited space. [[Optical fiber|Fiber-optic]] lamps for [[optical microscopy]] is one typical application.\n\n===Incandescent arc lamps===\nA variation of the incandescent lamp did not use a hot wire filament, but instead used an arc struck on a spherical bead electrode to produce heat. The electrode then became incandescent, with the arc contributing little to the light produced. Such lamps were used for projection or illumination for scientific instruments such as [[microscope]]s. These arc lamps ran on relatively low voltages and incorporated tungsten filaments to start ionization within the envelope. They provided the intense concentrated light of an [[arc lamp]] but were easier to operate. Developed around 1915, these lamps were displaced by mercury and [[xenon arc lamp]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Incandescent Arc Lamps|url=http://www.lamptech.co.uk/Miscellaneous.htm|publisher=Museum of Electric Lamp Technology|accessdate=17 June 2013|year=2004}}</ref><ref>G.

This means the actual power consumed (in watts) and the apparent power (in [[volt-ampere]]s) are equal. Incandescent light bulbs are usually [[marketing|marketed]] according to the [[electric power|electrical power]] consumed. This is measured in watts and depends mainly on the [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of the filament, which in turn depends mainly on the filament's length, thickness, and material. For two bulbs of the same voltage, type, color, and clarity, the higher-powered bulb gives more light.\n\nThe table shows the approximate typical output, in [[Lumen (unit)|lumens]], of standard incandescent light bulbs at various powers. Light output of a 230 V version is usually slightly less than that of a 120 V version. The lower current (higher voltage) filament is thinner and has to be operated at a slightly lower temperature for same life expectancy, and that reduces energy efficiency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://donklipstein.com/lfunfact.html|title=Light and Lighting Fun Facts|work=donklipstein.com}}</ref> The lumen values for \"soft white\" bulbs will generally be slightly lower than for clear bulbs at the same power.\n\n===Current and resistance===\nThe actual resistance of the filament is temperature dependent. The cold resistance of tungsten-filament lamps is about 1/15 the hot-filament resistance when the lamp is operating. For example, a 100-watt, 120-volt lamp has a resistance of 144 [[ohm]]s when lit, but the cold resistance is much lower (about 9.5 ohms).<ref name=\"GETP110\" /><ref>Edison's research team was aware of the large negative [[temperature coefficient of resistance]] of possible lamp filament materials and worked extensively during the period 1878\u20131879 on devising an automatic regulator or ''ballast'' to stabilize current. It wasn't until 1879 that it was realized a self-limiting lamp could be built. See Friedel and Israel ''Edison's Electric Light'' pages 29\u201331</ref> Since incandescent lamps are resistive loads, simple phase-control [[TRIAC]] [[dimmer]]s can be used to control brightness. Electrical contacts may carry a \"T\" rating symbol indicating that they are designed to control circuits with the high inrush current characteristic of tungsten lamps. For a 100-watt, 120-volt general-service lamp, the current stabilizes in about 0.10 seconds, and the lamp reaches 90% of its full brightness after about 0.13 seconds.<ref name=autogenerated3>page 23, 24</ref>\n\nCarbon filament bulbs have the opposite characteristic.  The resistance of a carbon filament is higher when it is cold than when it is operating.  In the case of a 240&nbsp;Volt, 60&nbsp;Watt carbon filament bulb, the resistance of the filament when at operating temperature is 960&nbsp;Ohms, but rises to around 1500&nbsp;Ohms when cold.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n\n===Bulb shapes ===\n[[File:incandescent bulb shapes.svg|thumb|480px|Incandescent light bulbs come in a range of shapes and sizes.]]\nIncandescent light bulbs come in a range of shapes and sizes.

Some reflector-type lamps include screw terminals for connection of wires. Most lamps have metal bases that fit in a socket to support the lamp and conduct current to the filament wires. In the late 19th century, manufacturers introduced a multitude of incompatible lamp bases. [[General Electric]] introduced standard base sizes for tungsten incandescent lamps under the [[Mazda (light bulb)|Mazda]] trademark in 1909. This standard was soon adopted across the US, and the Mazda name was used by many manufacturers under license through 1945. Today most incandescent lamps for general lighting service use an [[Edison screw]] in candelabra, intermediate, or standard or mogul sizes, or double contact [[Bayonet mount|bayonet]] base. Technical standards for lamp bases include ANSI standard C81.67 and IEC standard 60061-1 for common commercial lamp sizes, to ensure interchangeablitity between different manufacturer's products. Bayonet base lamps are frequently used in [[Automotive lamp types|automotive lamps]] to resist loosening due to vibration. A [[bipin]] base is often used for halogen or reflector lamps.<ref>{{cite web|title=Single-Ended Halogen Bases |url=http://www.bulbster.com/lightbulbs/singleended-halogen-c-783_43230.html |publisher=Bulbster.com |accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nLamp bases may be secured to the bulb with a cement, or by mechanical crimping to indentations molded into the glass bulb.\n\nMiniature lamps used for some automotive lamps or decorative lamps have [[wedge base]]s that have a partial plastic or even completely glass base. In this case, the wires wrap around to the outside of the bulb, where they press against the contacts in the socket. Miniature Christmas bulbs use a plastic wedge base as well.\n\nLamps intended for use in optical systems such as film projectors, microscope illuminators, or [[stage lighting instruments]] have bases with alignment features so that the filament is positioned accurately within the optical system. A screw-base lamp may have a random orientation of the filament when the lamp is installed in the socket.\n\n==Light output and lifetime==\n[[File:Livermore Centennial Light Bulb.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Centennial Light]] is the longest-lasting light bulb in the world.]]\n[[File:Various lighting spectrums - Flurescent incandescent diode and candle.jpg|thumb|Various lighting spectra as viewed in a diffraction grating.

These characteristics are of great practical and economic importance.\n\nFor a supply voltage ''V'' near the rated voltage of the lamp:\n\n* ''Light'' output is approximately proportional to ''V''<sup> 3.4</sup>\n* ''Power'' consumption is approximately proportional to ''V''<sup> 1.6</sup>\n* ''Lifetime'' is approximately proportional to ''V''<sup> \u221216</sup>\n* ''Color temperature'' is approximately proportional to ''V''<sup> 0.42</sup><ref>[[Donald G.

Wayne Beaty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition'', McGraw-Hill, New York, 1978, ISBN 0-07-020974-X, pg 22\u20138</ref>\n\nThis means that a 5% reduction in operating voltage will more than double the life of the bulb, at the expense of reducing its light output by about 16%. This may be a very acceptable trade off for a light bulb that is in a difficult-to-access location (for example, traffic lights or fixtures hung from high ceilings). Long-life bulbs take advantage of this trade-off. Since the value of the electric power they consume is much more than the value of the lamp, general service lamps emphasize efficiency over long operating life. The objective is to minimize the cost of light, not the cost of lamps.<ref name=\"GETP110\" /> Early bulbs had a life of up to 2500 hours, but in 1924 a [[Phoebus cartel|cartel]] agreed to limit life to 1000 hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Great Lightbulb Conspiracy |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/history/the-great-lightbulb-conspiracy |work=IEEE Spectrum |publisher=IEEE |first=Markus |last=Krajewski |date=24 Sep 2014 |accessdate=10 Nov 2014}}</ref> When this was exposed in 1953, General Electric and other leading American manufacturers were banned from limiting the life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_17287091|title=Tests shine light on the secret of the Livermore light bulb|date=6 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe relationships above are valid for only a few percent change of voltage around rated conditions, but they do indicate that a lamp operated at much lower than rated voltage could last for hundreds of times longer than at rated conditions, albeit with greatly reduced light output. The \"[[Centennial Light]]\" is a light bulb that is accepted by the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as having been burning almost continuously at a [[fire station]] in [[Livermore, California]], since 1901. However, the bulb emits the equivalent light of a four watt bulb. A similar story can be told of a 40-watt bulb in Texas that has been illuminated since 21 September 1908. It once resided in an [[opera house]] where notable celebrities stopped to take in its glow, and was moved to an area museum in 1977.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homelighting.com/article.cfm?intarticleID=880 |title=Watts Up? \u2013 A parting look at lighting|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207211654/http://www.homelighting.com/article.cfm?intarticleID=880 |archivedate=7 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn flood lamps used for photographic lighting, the tradeoff is made in the other direction. Compared to general-service bulbs, for the same power, these bulbs produce far more light, and (more importantly) light at a higher color temperature, at the expense of greatly reduced life (which may be as short as two hours for a type P1 lamp). The upper temperature limit for the filament is the melting point of the metal. Tungsten is the metal with the highest melting point, {{convert|3695|K|F}}. A 50-hour-life projection bulb, for instance, is designed to operate only {{convert|50|C|F}} below that melting point. Such a lamp may achieve up to 22 lumens per watt, compared with 17.5 for a 750-hour general service lamp.<ref name=\"GETP110\" />\n\nLamps designed for different voltages have different luminous efficacy. For example, a 100-watt, 120-volt lamp will produce about 17.1 lumens per watt. A lamp with the same rated lifetime but designed for 230 V would produce only around 12.8 lumens per watt, and a similar lamp designed for 30 volts (train lighting) would produce as much as 19.8 lumens per watt.<ref name=\"GETP110\" /> Lower voltage lamps have a thicker filament, for the same power rating. They can run hotter for the same lifetime before the filament evaporates.\n\nThe wires used to support the filament make it mechanically stronger, but remove heat, creating another tradeoff between efficiency and long life. Many general-service 120-volt lamps use no additional support wires, but lamps designed for \"[[rough service]]\" or \"vibration service\" may have as many as five. Low-voltage lamps have filaments made of heavier wire and do not require additional support wires.\n\nVery low voltages are inefficient since the lead wires would conduct too much heat away from the filament, so the practical lower limit for incandescent lamps is 1.5 volts. Very long filaments for high voltages are fragile, and lamp bases become more difficult to insulate, so lamps for illumination are not made with rated voltages over 300 volts.<ref name=\"GETP110\" /> Some infrared heating elements are made for higher voltages, but these use tubular bulbs with widely separated terminals.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy}}\n{{columns-list|2|\n* [[Flash (photography)]]\n* [[Lampshade]]\n* [[Light tube]]\n* [[Lightbulb joke]]s\n* [[List of light sources]]\n* [[Longest-lasting light bulbs]]\n* [[Over-illumination]]\n* [[Photometry (optics)]]\n* [[Spectrometer]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Incandescent light bulbs}}\n* [http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/online/measurements/source-spectra/index.html Light Source Spectra] 60 W-100 W Incandescent light bulb spectra, from Cornell University Program of Computer Graphics\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlmMaJB7Rmc Slow-motion video of an incandescent lightbulb filament]\n\n{{Artificial light sources}}\n{{Thomas Edison}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Incandescent light bulbs| ]]\n[[Category:Discovery and invention controversies]]\n[[Category:English inventions]]\n[[Category:Thomas Edison]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:1878 introductions]]"}]}}}}
