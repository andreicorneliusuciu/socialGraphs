The main use of a stator is to keep the field aligned.\n\n==In motors==\nDepending on the configuration of a spinning electromotive device the stator may act as the ''field  magnet'', interacting with the [[armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] to create motion, or it may act as the ''armature'', receiving its influence from moving field coils on the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]].\nThe first [[direct current|DC]] generators (known as [[dynamo]]s) and [[Electric motor#Wound field DC motor|DC motors]] put the field coils on the stator, and the power generation or motive reaction coils on the rotor. This is necessary because a continuously moving power switch known as the [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] is needed to keep the field correctly aligned across the spinning rotor. The commutator must become larger and more robust as the current increases.\n\n[[File:Stator winding at WPS.JPG|thumb|left|Stator winding of a generator at a [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power station]].]]\nThe stator of these devices may be either a permanent [[magnet]] or an [[electromagnet]].  Where the stator is an electromagnet, the coil which energizes it is known as the ''field coil'' or ''field winding''. \n\nThe coil can be either [[iron]] core or [[Aluminium|aluminum]]. To reduce loading losses in motors, manufacturers invariably use [[copper]] as the conducting material in windings.<ref>[http://www.engineerlive.com/Design-Engineer/Motors_and_Drives/IE3_energy-saving_motors/22687/ IE3 energy-saving motors], Engineer Live</ref><ref>[http://www.drives.co.uk/fullstory.asp?id=978 Ultra efficient motors have copper rotors]; Drives and Controls; April 2006</ref> Aluminum, because of its lower electrical conductivity, may be an alternate material in fractional horsepower motors, especially when the motors are used for very short durations.\n\nAn [[alternating current|AC]] [[alternator]] is able to produce power across multiple high-current power generation coils connected in parallel, eliminating the need for the commutator. Placing the field coils on the rotor allows for an inexpensive [[slip ring]] mechanism to transfer high-voltage, low current power to the rotating field coil.\n\nIt consists of a steel frame enclosing a hollow cylindrical core (made up of laminations of [[Electrical steel|silicon steel]]). The laminations are to reduce [[hysteresis]] and [[eddy current]] losses.\n\n==Fluid devices==\nIn a [[turbine]], the stator element contains blades or ports used to redirect the flow of fluid.  Such devices include the [[steam turbine]] and the [[torque converter]]. In a mechanical siren, the stator contains one or more rows of holes that admit air into the rotor; by controlling the flow of air through the holes, the sound of the siren can be altered. \n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Stators (machine element)|Stator}}\n\n{{Electric motor}}\n\n[[Category:Electric motors]]\n[[Category:Sirens]]"}]}}}}
