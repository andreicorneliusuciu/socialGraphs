However, similar concepts were developed by British and French jurists in the eighteenth century.

An object identified as a possible flute (the [[Divje Babe Flute]]) is more than 40,000 years old.  Even if humans had musical instruments and made music there was a need for a [[musical notation]] system to be able to preserve song through writing. The first such system, the [[Music of Mesopotamia|Music of Mesopotamia notation system]], was created 4000 years ago.  In the X century [[Guido of Arezzo]] introduced Latin musical notations.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} All this laid the foundation for the preservation of global music belonging to the public domain since the beginning of musical history to the present.\n\n[[Musopen]] project has been dedicated to record this music whose records are in the public domain using musical instruments and equipment sound capture for not only musical writings are available to the general public but also can the music itself in an audibly way high quality formats [[lossless compression|lossless formats]] like [[Flac]] that gives the highest possible quality, and also in a low quality format or [[lossy compression|with lost]] as .ogg files (that were very useful during the early years of [[Internet]] and the first generations of [[portable media player]]).

The [[Europeana]] databases use it, and for instance on the [[Wikimedia Commons]] on February 2016 2.9 million works (~10% of all works) are listed as ''PDM''.<ref>[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:CC-PD-Mark Category:CC-PD-Mark ] on February 2016</ref>\n\n==Application to copyrightable works==\n\n===Works not covered by copyright law===\nThe underlying [[idea]] that is expressed or manifested in the creation of a work generally cannot be the subject of copyright law (see [[idea-expression divide]]). Mathematical formulae will therefore generally form part of the public domain, to the extent that their expression in the form of software is not covered by copyright.\n\nWorks created before the existence of copyright and patent laws also form part of the public domain.  For example, [[the Bible]] and the inventions of [[Archimedes]] are in the public domain, but copyright may exist in translations or new formulations of these works.\n\n===Expiration of copyright===\nDetermination of whether a copyright has expired depends on an examination of the copyright in its \"source country\".\n\nIn the United States, determining whether a work has entered the public domain or is still under copyright can be quite complex, primarily because [[copyright terms]] have been extended multiple times and in different ways\u2014shifting over the course of the 20th century from a fixed-term based on first publication, with a possible renewal term, to a term extending to fifty, then seventy, years after the death of the author.  The claim that \"pre-1923 works are in the public domain\" is correct only for published works; unpublished works are under federal copyright for at least the life of the author plus 70 years.\n\nIn most other countries that are signatories to the [[Berne Convention]], copyright term is based on the life of the author, and extends to 50 or 70 years beyond the death of the author. (See [[List of countries' copyright length]].)\n\nLegal traditions differ on whether a work in the public domain can have its copyright restored. In the European Union, the [[Copyright Duration Directive]] was applied retroactively, restoring and extending the terms of copyright on material previously in the public domain.  Term extensions by the U.S. and Australia generally have not removed works from the public domain, but rather delayed the addition of works to it. However, the United States moved away from that tradition with the [[Uruguay Round Agreements Act]], which removed from the public domain many foreign-sourced works that had previously not been in copyright in the US for failure to comply with US-based [[copyright formalities|formalities requirements]].  Consequently, in the US, foreign-sourced works and US-sourced works are now treated differently, with foreign-sourced works remaining under copyright regardless of compliance with formalities, while domestically-sourced works may be in the public domain if they failed to comply with then-existing formalities requirements\u2014a situation described as odd by some scholars, and unfair by some US-based rightsholders.<ref>[[Dennis Karjala]], \"Judicial Oversight of Copyright Legislation\", 35 N.

Albany: Matthew Bender.</ref>\n\n===Dedicating works to the public domain===\n\n==== Release without copyright notice ====\nBefore 1988 in the US, works could be easily given into the public domain by just releasing it without an explicit [[Copyright notice]]. With the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] Implementation Act of 1988 (and the earlier [[Copyright Act of 1976]], which went into effect in 1978), all works were by default copyright protected and needed to be actively given into public domain by a [[waiver]] statement/[[anti-copyright notice]].<ref name=\"cornelledu\">[http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm publicdomain] on [[cornell.edu]]</ref><ref name=\"copyrightgov\">''[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.pdf Copyright Notice]'', U.S. Copyright Office Circular 3, 2008.</ref> Not all legal systems have processes for reliably donating works to the public domain, e.g. [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] of [[continental Europe]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} This may even \"effectively prohibit any attempt by copyright owners to surrender rights automatically conferred by law, particularly [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]]\".<ref name=\"aboutcc0\">{{cite web | url=http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0 | title=About CC0 \u2014 \"No Rights Reserved\" | publisher=[[Creative Commons]] | accessdate=23 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==== Public domain like licenses ====\n{{main article|Public domain equivalent license}}\nAn alternative is for copyright holders to issue a licence which irrevocably grants as many rights as possible to the general public. Real public domain makes [[license]]s unnecessary, as no owner/author is required to grant permission (\"[[Permission culture]]\"). There are multiple licenses which aim release works into the public domain. In 2000 the [[WTFPL]] was released as public domain like [[software license]].<ref>[http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/pkg-wmaker/trunk/COPYING.WTFPL?revision=2&view=markup Version 1.0 license] on anonscm.debian.org</ref> In 2009 the [[Creative commons]] released the [[Creative Commons license#Zero .2F public domain|CC0]], which was created for [[License compatibility|compatibility]] with also law domains which have no concept of ''dedicating into public domain''. This is achieved by a public domain waiver statement and a fall-back all-permissive license, in case the waiver is not possible.<ref>https://creativecommons.org/weblog/2009/03/11/13304</ref><ref name=\"CC0\">[https://rd-alliance.org/sites/default/files/cc0-analysis-kreuzer.pdf Validity of the Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication and its usability for bibliographic metadata from the perspective of German Copyright Law] by Dr. Till Kreutzer, attorney-at-law in [[Berlin, Germany]]</ref> The ''Unlicense'', published around 2010, has a focus on an [[Anti-copyright]] message. The Unlicense offers a public domain waiver text with a fall-back public domain-like license inspired by permissive licenses but without attribution.<ref>[http://ostatic.com/blog/the-unlicense-a-license-for-no-license the-unlicense-a-license-for-no-license] on ostatic.com by Joe Brockmeier (2010)</ref><ref>[http://unlicense.org The Unlicense] on unlicense.org</ref>\n\nIn October 2014 the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]] recommends the Creative Commons [[CC0]] license to dedicate content to the public domain,<ref>[http://opendefinition.org/licenses/ licenses] on opendefinition.com</ref><ref>[https://blog.creativecommons.org/2013/12/27/creative-commons-4-0-by-and-by-sa-licenses-approved-conformant-with-the-open-definition/ Creative Commons 4.0 BY and BY-SA licenses approved conformant with the Open Definition] by Timothy Vollmer on creativecommons.org (27 December 2013)</ref> and the ''Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL)'' for data.<ref>[http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/ pddl] on opendatacommons.org</ref>\n\n==Patents==\n{{Main article|Term of patent}}\nIn most countries the term or rights for patents is 20 years, after which the invention becomes part of the public domain. In the United States, the contents of patents are considered valid and enforceable for twenty years from the date of filing within the United States or twenty years from the earliest date of filing if under 35 USC 120, 121, or 365(c).<ref>Manual of Patent Examining Procedure available at http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/s2701.html</ref> However, the ''text'' and any ''illustration'' within a patent, provided the illustrations are essentially line drawings and do not in any substantive way reflect the \"personality\" of the person drawing them, are not subject to copyright protection.<ref>[http://www.uspto.gov/main/ccpubguide.htm Copyright and Trademark Issues RE: Materials from USPTO Website]</ref>  This is separate from the ''patent'' rights just mentioned.\n\n==Trademarks==\nA trademark registration may remain in force indefinitely, or expire without specific regard to its age. For a trademark registration to remain valid, the owner must continue to use it. In some circumstances, such as disuse, failure to assert trademark rights, or common usage by the public without regard for its intended use, it could become [[genericized trademark|generic]], and therefore part of the public domain.\n\nBecause trademarks are registered with governments, some countries or trademark registries may recognize a mark, while others may have determined that it is generic and not allowable as a trademark in that registry. For example, the drug \"acetylsalicylic acid\" (2-acetoxybenzoic acid) is better known as ''[[aspirin]]'' in the United States\u2014a generic term. In Canada, however, \"Aspirin\", with an upper case A, is still a trademark of the German company [[Bayer]], while aspirin, with a lower case \"a\" is not. Bayer lost the trademark in the United States, the UK and France after World War I, as part of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. So many copy-cat products entered the marketplace during the war that it was deemed generic just three years later.<ref>[http://www.worldofmolecules.com/drugs/aspirin.htm Aspirin], World of Molecules</ref>\n\nBayer also lost the trademark for \"Heroin\",{{where|date=August 2014}} which it trademarked a year before it trademarked Aspirin.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nAlthough [[Hormel]] resigned itself to genericide,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spam.com/about/internet.aspx|title=SPAM\u00ae Brand and the Internet|publisher=Hormel Foods}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> it has fought attempts by other companies to register \"[[spam (food)|spam]]\" as a [[trademark]] [[spamming|in relation to computer products]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/31/spam_ruling/ |title=Hormel Spam trademark case canned |author=Kieren McCarthy |date=31 January 2005 |accessdate=2 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Public Domain Day ==\n{{main article|Public Domain Day}}\n[[File:Logo PDD 2016.svg|thumb|An English logo of the 2015/2016 Public Domain Day in Poland]]\n\n'''Public Domain Day''' is an observance of when [[copyright]]s expire and works enter into the public domain.<ref name=\"telcouk\">{{cite web|last=Richmond |first=Shane |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/shanerichmond/100004467/happy-public-domain-day-heres-to-many-more/ |title=Happy Public Domain Day!
