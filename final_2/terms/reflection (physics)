Common examples include the reflection of [[light]], [[sound]] and [[water wave]]s. The ''law of reflection'' says that for [[specular reflection]] the angle at which the wave is incident on the surface equals the angle at which it is reflected. [[Mirror]]s exhibit specular reflection.\n\nIn [[acoustics]], reflection causes [[Echo (phenomenon)|echoes]] and is used in [[sonar]]. In geology, it is important in the study of [[seismic wave]]s. Reflection is observed with [[surface wave]]s in bodies of water. Reflection is observed with many types of [[electromagnetic wave]], besides [[visible light]]. Reflection of [[Very high frequency|VHF]] and higher frequencies is important for [[radio]] transmission and for [[radar]]. Even [[hard X-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s can be reflected at shallow angles with special \"grazing\" mirrors.\n\n==Reflection of light==\nReflection of light is either ''[[Specular reflection|specular]]'' (mirror-like) or ''[[Diffuse reflection|diffuse]]'' (retaining the [[energy]], but losing the image) depending on the nature of the interface. In specular reflection the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the reflected waves depends on the choice of the origin of coordinates, but the relative phase between s and p (TE and TM) polarizations is fixed by the properties of the media and of the interface between them.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lekner |first=John |title=Theory of Reflection, of Electromagnetic and Particle Waves |publisher=Springer |year=1987 |isbn=9789024734184}}</ref>\n\nA mirror provides the most common model for specular light reflection, and typically consists of a glass sheet with a metallic coating where the reflection actually occurs. Reflection is enhanced in metals by suppression of wave propagation beyond their [[skin depth]]s.  Reflection also occurs at the surface of [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] media, such as water or [[glass]].\n\n[[Image:Reflection angles.svg|frame|left|upright|Diagram of specular reflection]]\nIn the diagram at left, a light ray '''PO''' strikes a vertical mirror at point '''O''', and the reflected ray is '''OQ'''. By projecting an imaginary line through point '''O''' perpendicular to the mirror, known as the ''normal'', we can measure the ''angle of incidence'', ''\u03b8''<sub>i</sub> and the ''angle of reflection'', ''\u03b8''<sub>r</sub>. The ''law of reflection'' states that ''\u03b8''<sub>i</sub> = \u03b8''<sub>r</sub>, or in other words, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\n\nIn fact, reflection of light may occur whenever light travels from a medium of a given [[refractive index]] into a medium with a different refractive index. In the most general case, a certain fraction of the light is reflected from the interface, and the remainder is [[refraction|refracted]].  Solving [[Maxwell's equations]] for a light ray striking a boundary allows the derivation of the [[Fresnel equations]], which can be used to predict how much of the light is reflected, and how much is refracted in a given situation. This is analogous to the way [[impedance matching|impedance mismatch]] in an electric circuit causes reflection of signals.  [[Total internal reflection]] of light from a denser medium occurs if the angle of incidence is above the [[Snell's law|critical angle]].\n\nTotal internal reflection is used as a means of focusing waves that cannot effectively be reflected by common means. [[X-ray telescope]]s are constructed by creating a converging \"tunnel\" for the waves. As the waves interact at low angle with the surface of this tunnel they are reflected toward the focus point (or toward another interaction with the tunnel surface, eventually being directed to the detector at the focus). A conventional reflector would be useless as the X-rays would simply pass through the intended reflector.\n\nWhen light reflects off a material denser (with higher refractive index) than the external medium, it undergoes a [[Polarity (physics)|polarity]] inversion.  In contrast, a less dense, lower refractive index material will reflect light [[in phase]].  This is an important principle in the field of [[thin-film optics]].\n\nSpecular reflection forms [[image]]s. Reflection from a flat surface forms a [[mirror image]], which appears to be reversed from left to right because we compare the image we see to what we would see if we were rotated into the position of the image. Specular reflection at a curved surface forms an image which may be [[magnification|magnified]] or demagnified; [[curved mirror]]s have [[optical power]]. Such mirrors may have surfaces that are [[sphere|spherical]] or [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic]].\n{{clear|right}}\n\n[[Image:RefractionReflextion.svg|thumb|center|650px|Refraction of light at the interface between two media.]]\n\n===Laws of reflection===\n[[Image:F\u00e9nyvisszaver\u0151d\u00e9s.jpg|An example of the law of reflection|thumb|right]]\n{{Main|Specular reflection}}\nIf the reflecting surface is very smooth, the reflection of light that occurs is called specular or regular reflection. The laws of reflection are as follows:\n#The incident ray, the reflected ray and the normal to the reflection surface at the point of the incidence lie in the same plane.\n#The angle which the incident ray makes with the normal is equal to the angle which the reflected ray makes to the same normal.\n#The reflected ray and the incident ray are on the opposite sides of the normal.\n\nThese three laws can all be derived from the [[Fresnel equations]].\n\n====Mechanism====\n\n[[File:Reflection of a quantum particle.webm|thumb|2D simulation: reflection of a quantum particle. White blur represents the probability distribution of finding a particle in a given place if measured.]]\n\nIn [[Classical electromagnetism|classical electrodynamics]], light is considered as an electromagnetic wave, which is described by [[Maxwell's equations]]. Light waves incident on a material induce small oscillations of [[Dielectric polarization|polarisation]] in the individual atoms (or oscillation of electrons, in metals), causing each particle to radiate a small secondary wave in all directions, like a [[dipole antenna]]. All these waves add up to give specular reflection and refraction, according to the [[Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle]].\n\nIn the case of dielectrics such as glass, the electric field of the light acts on the electrons in the material, and the moving electrons generate fields and become new radiators. The refracted light in the glass is the combination of the forward radiation of the electrons and the incident light. The reflected light is the combination of the backward radiation of all of the electrons.\n\nIn metals, electrons with no binding energy are called free electrons. When these electrons oscillate with the incident light, the phase difference between their radiation field and the incident field is \u03c0 (180\u00b0), so the forward radiation cancels the incident light, and backward radiation is just the reflected light.\n\nLight\u2013matter interaction in terms of photons is a topic of [[quantum electrodynamics]], and is described in detail by [[Richard Feynman]] in his popular book ''[[QED (book)|QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]''.\n\n===Diffuse reflection===\n[[Image:Diffuse refl.gif|thumb|right|General scattering mechanism which gives [[diffuse reflection]] by a solid surface]]\n{{Main|Diffuse reflection}}\nWhen light strikes the surface of a (non-metallic) material it bounces off in all directions due to multiple reflections by the microscopic irregularities ''inside'' the material (e.g. the [[grain boundaries]] of a [[polycrystalline]] material, or the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] or [[fiber]] boundaries of an organic material) and by its surface, if it is rough. Thus, an 'image' is not formed. This is called ''[[diffuse reflection]]''. The exact form of the reflection depends on the structure of the material. One common model for diffuse reflection is [[Lambertian reflectance]], in which the light is reflected with equal [[luminance]] (in photometry) or [[radiance]] (in radiometry) in all directions, as defined by [[Lambert's cosine law]].\n\nThe light sent to our eyes by most of the objects we see is due to diffuse reflection from their surface, so that this is our primary mechanism of physical observation.<ref name=\"y\">{{cite journal\n|author=Mandelstam, L.I.\n|title=Light Scattering by Inhomogeneous Media\n|journal=Zh. Russ. Fiz-Khim. Ova.\n|volume=58\n|page=381\n|year=1926\n}}</ref>\n\n===Retroreflection===\n[[Image:Corner-reflector.svg|right|thumb|Working principle of a corner reflector]]\n{{Main|Retroreflector}}\nSome surfaces exhibit ''retroreflection''. The structure of these surfaces is such that light is returned in the direction from which it came.\n\nWhen flying over clouds illuminated by sunlight the region seen around the aircraft's shadow will appear brighter, and a similar effect may be seen from dew on grass. This partial retro-reflection is created by the refractive properties of the curved droplet's surface and reflective properties at the backside of the droplet.\n\nSome animals' [[retina]]s act as retroreflectors, as this effectively improves the animals' night vision. Since the lenses of their eyes modify reciprocally the paths of the incoming and outgoing light the effect is that the eyes act as a strong retroreflector, sometimes seen at night when walking in wildlands with a flashlight.\n\nA simple retroreflector can be made by placing three ordinary mirrors mutually perpendicular to one another (a [[corner reflector]]). The image produced is the inverse of one produced by a single mirror. \nA surface can be made partially retroreflective by depositing a layer of tiny refractive spheres on it or by creating small pyramid like structures. In both cases internal reflection causes the light to be reflected back to where it originated.<!--Can someone describe this in more detail?--> This is used to make traffic signs and automobile license plates reflect light mostly back in the direction from which it came. In this application perfect retroreflection is not desired, since the light would then be directed back into the headlights of an oncoming car rather than to the driver's eyes.\n\n=== Multiple reflections ===\nWhen light reflects off a [[mirror]], one image appears. Two mirrors placed exactly face to face give the appearance of an infinite number of images along a straight line. The multiple images seen between two mirrors that sit at an angle to each other lie over a circle.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Virtual mirrors |journal= Physics Teacher|volume=20|page=278|year=1982| author= M. Iona |bibcode = 1982PhTea..20..278G |doi = 10.1119/1.2341067|issue= 5 }}</ref> The center of that circle is located at the imaginary intersection of the mirrors. A square of four mirrors placed face to face give the appearance of an infinite number of images arranged in a plane. The multiple images seen between four mirrors assembling a pyramid, in which each pair of mirrors sits an angle to each other, lie over a sphere. If the base of the pyramid is rectangle shaped, the images spread over a section of a [[torus]].<ref>{{cite journal|title= Output irradiance of tapered lightpipes |journal=JOSA A|volume=27|issue=9|page=1985|year=2010|url=http://fisica.uaz.edu.mx/~imoreno/Publicaciones/JOSA2010.pdf|doi=10.1364/JOSAA.27.001985| author=I. Moreno|bibcode = 2010JOSAA..27.1985M }}</ref>\n\n===Complex conjugate reflection===\nIn this process (which is also known as phase conjugation), light bounces exactly back in the direction from which it came due to a nonlinear optical process. Not only the direction of the light is reversed, but the actual wavefronts are reversed as well. A [[phase-conjugate mirror|conjugate reflector]] can be used to remove [[Aberration in optical systems|aberrations]] from a beam by reflecting it and then passing the reflection through the aberrating optics a second time.\n\n==Other types of reflection==\n\n===Neutron reflection===\nMaterials that reflect [[neutron]]s, for example [[beryllium]], are used in [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s. In the physical and biological sciences, the [[Neutron Reflectometry|reflection of neutrons]] off of atoms within a material is commonly used to determine the material's internal structure.\n\n===Sound reflection===\n[[File:Studio soundproofing panel.jpg|thumb|right|Sound diffusion panel for high frequencies]]\nWhen a longitudinal [[sound wave]] strikes a flat surface, sound is reflected in a coherent manner provided that the dimension of the reflective surface is large compared to the wavelength of the sound. Note that audible sound has a very wide frequency range (from 20 to about 17000&nbsp;Hz), and thus a very wide range of wavelengths (from about 20&nbsp;mm to 17&nbsp;m). As a result, the overall nature of the reflection varies according to the texture and structure of the surface. For example, porous materials will absorb some energy, and rough materials (where rough is relative to the wavelength) tend to reflect in many directions\u2014to scatter the energy, rather than to reflect it coherently. This leads into the field of [[architectural acoustics]], because the nature of these reflections is critical to the auditory feel of a space. \nIn the theory of exterior [[noise mitigation]], reflective surface size mildly detracts from the concept of a [[noise barrier]] by reflecting some of the sound into the opposite direction.\n\n===Seismic reflection===\n{{details|reflection seismology}}\n[[Seismic wave]]s produced by [[earthquake]]s or other sources (such as [[explosion]]s) may be reflected by layers within the [[Earth]].  Study of the deep reflections of waves generated by earthquakes has allowed [[seismologist]]s to determine the layered [[structure of the Earth]].  Shallower reflections are used in [[reflection seismology]] to study the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] generally, and in particular to prospect for [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] deposits.\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|3}}\n*[[Anti-reflective coating]]\n*[[Diffraction]]\n*[[Echo satellite]]\n*[[Espresso crema effect]]\n*[[Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle]]\n*[[Negative refraction]]\n*[[Ocean surface wave]]\n*[[Reflection coefficient]]\n*[[Reflectivity]]\n*[[Refraction]]\n*[[Ripple tank]]\n*[[Signal reflection]]\n*[[Snell's law]]\n*[[Sun glitter]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons|Reflection}}{{Commons category|Reflections}}\n*[http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/feschools/waves/reflect.htm Acoustic reflection]\n*[http://qed.wikina.org/reflection/ Animations demonstrating optical reflection] by QED\n*[http://amrita.olabs.co.in/?sub=1&brch=1&sim=1&cnt=1&id=0 Simulation on Laws of Reflection of Sound] By Amrita University\n\n[[Category:Concepts in physics]]\n[[Category:Geometrical optics]]\n[[Category:Physical optics]]"}]}}}}
