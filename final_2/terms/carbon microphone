It consists of two [[metal]] plates separated by granules of [[carbon]]. One plate is very thin and faces toward the speaking person, acting as a [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]].  [[Sound wave]]s striking the diaphragm cause it to vibrate, exerting a varying [[pressure]] on the granules, which in turn changes the [[electrical resistance]] between the plates.  Higher pressure lowers the resistance as the granules are pushed closer together.  A steady [[direct current]] is passed between the plates through the granules.  The varying resistance results in a [[modulation]] of the current, creating a varying electric current that reproduces the varying pressure of the sound wave.  In [[telephony]], this undulating current is directly passed through the telephone wires to the [[telephone exchange|central office]]. In [[public address]] systems or  [[recording]] devices it is amplified by an [[audio amplifier]].  The [[frequency response]] of the carbon microphone, however, is limited to a narrow range, and the device produces significant [[electrical noise]].\n\nBefore the proliferation of [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers in the 1920s, carbon microphones were the only practical means of obtaining high-level audio signals. They were widely used in telephone systems until the 1980s, while other applications used different microphone designs much earlier. Their low cost, inherently high output and frequency response characteristic were well suited for telephony. For [[plain old telephone service]] (POTS), carbon-microphone based telephones can still be used without modification. Carbon microphones, usually modified telephone transmitters, were widely used in early [[AM broadcasting|AM radio broadcasting]] systems, but their limited frequency response, as well as a fairly high noise level, led to their abandonment in those applications by the late 1920s. They continued to be widely used for low-end public address, and military and [[amateur radio]] applications for some decades afterward.<ref>Heil, B. The Microphone: A Short Illustrated History.

This was independently developed by [[David Edward Hughes]] in England and [[Emile Berliner]] and [[Thomas Edison]] in the US. Although Edison was awarded the first patent in mid-1877, Hughes had demonstrated his working device in front of many witnesses some years earlier, and most historians credit him with its invention.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9wEntQmA0IC|title=Oliver Heaviside: The Life, Work, and Times of an Electrical Genius of the Victorian Age|author=Paul J.

Hughes also coined the word microphone. He demonstrated his apparatus to the [[Royal Society]] by magnifying the sound of insects scratching through a sound box. Contrary to Edison, Hughes decided not to take out a patent; instead, he made his invention a gift to the world.<ref name=\"microphone-data\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.microphone-data.com/media/filestore/articles/History-10.pdf|title=A brief history of microphones|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>\n\nIn America, Edison and Berliner fought a long legal battle over the patent rights. Ultimately a federal court awarded Edison full rights to the invention, stating \"Edison preceded Berliner in the transmission of speech...The use of carbon in a transmitter is, beyond controversy, the invention of Edison\" and the Berliner patent was ruled invalid.<ref>[http://www.invent.org/Hall_Of_Fame/13.html Inventors Hall of Fame] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060610035645/http://www.invent.org/Hall_Of_Fame/13.html |date=June 10, 2006 }}, E.

In these repeaters, a magnetic telephone receiver (an electrical-to-mechanical [[transducer]]) was mechanically coupled to a carbon microphone. Because a carbon microphone works by varying a current passed through it, instead of generating a signal [[voltage]] as with most other microphone types, this arrangement could be used to boost weak signals and send them down the line. These amplifiers were mostly abandoned with the development of [[vacuum tube]]s, which offered higher [[gain (electronics)|gain]] and better [[sound quality]]. Even after vacuum tubes were in common use, carbon amplifiers continued to be used during the 1930s in portable audio equipment such as hearing aids. The Western Electric 65A carbon amplifier was 1.2\" in diameter and 0.4\" high and weighed less than 1.4 ounces.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/COMMS/mechamp/mechamp.htm\n |title=Electro-Mechanical amplifiers (Western Electric 65A carbon amplifier in 66B hearing aid)\n |author=Douglas Self\n}}</ref> Such carbon amplifiers did not require the heavy bulky batteries and power supplies used by vacuum tube amplifiers. By the 1950s, carbon amplifiers for hearing aids had been replaced by miniature vacuum tubes (only to be shortly replaced by transistors).{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} However, carbon amplifiers are still being produced and sold.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.headset-plus.com/0686-netcom-0686-inline-carbon-amplifier-p-588.html\n |title=GN 0686 Netcom In-Line Carbon Amplifier\n |publisher=Headset-Plus.com\n}}</ref>\n\nAn illustration of the amplification provided by carbon microphones was the oscillation caused by feedback, that resulted in an audible squeal from the old \"[[candlestick telephone]]\" if its earphone was placed near the carbon microphone.\n\n===Early radio applications===\nEarly [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] [[radio transmitter]]s relied on carbon microphones for voice modulation of the radio signal. In the first long-distance [[sound|audio]] transmissions by [[Reginald Fessenden]] in 1906, a [[continuous wave]] from an [[Alexanderson alternator]] was fed directly to the transmitting antenna through a water-cooled carbon microphone. Later systems using [[vacuum tube]] [[oscillators]] often used the output from a carbon microphone to modulate the [[grid bias]] of the oscillator or output tube to achieve modulation.\n\n==Current usage==\nApart from legacy telephone installations in [[Third World]] countries, carbon microphones are still used today in certain niche applications in the developed world. An example is the [[Shure]] 104c,<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.shure.com/uploads/user_guide/upload/349/us_pro_104c_ug.pdf\n |title=Model 104C Guide\n |publisher=Shure Incorporated\n |format=PDF\n}}</ref> which is still in demand because of its wide compatibility with existing equipment.\n\nThe principal advantage of carbon microphones over other microphone designs is that they can produce high-level audio signals from very low DC voltages, without needing any form of additional amplification or batteries.  This is particularly useful in remote locations served by very long telephone lines, where the electrical resistance of the wires can lead to severe DC voltage drop.  Most all-electronic telephones need at least three volts DC to work, and so will often become useless in such situations, whereas carbon transmitter telephones will continue to work down to a fraction of a volt.  Even where they do work, electronic telephones also suffer from the so-called \"[[cliff effect]]\", whereby they abruptly stop working when the line voltage falls below the critical level.  In particular, this means that one telephone on a \"[[Party line (telephony)|party line]]\" may tend to \"hog\" all the [[electrical current|line current]], cutting the others off.  With carbon microphones, all receivers on the same line will still operate, albeit with [[current divider|reduced output]].\n\nCarbon microphones are also widely used in safety-critical applications such as [[mining]] and [[chemical manufacturing]], where higher line voltages cannot be used, due to the risk of sparking and consequent [[explosion]]s. Carbon-based telephone systems are also resistant to damage from high-[[voltage transient]]s, such as those produced by [[lightning]] strikes, and [[electromagnetic pulse]]s of the type generated by [[nuclear explosion]]s, and so are still maintained as backup communication systems in critical military installations.\n\n==References==\n<References/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Josephson, Matthew, ''Edison: A Biography'', Wiley, 1992, ISBN 0-471-54806-5\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Carbon microphones}}\n* [http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/hst/biography/Edison/chap36.html Edison's invention of the carbon (graphite) microphone]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Frank Dyer\n* T A Edison, {{US patent|0474230}} ''Speaking Telegraph'' (graphite microphone), filed April 1877, issued May 1892\n* T A Edison, {{US patent|0203016}} ''Improvement in Speaking Telephones'' (compressed lamp black button insulated from diaphragm), filed March 1878, issued  April, 1878\n* T A Edison, {{US patent|0222390}} ''Carbon Telephone'' (carbon granules microphone), filed Nov 1878, issued Dec 1879\n* E.
