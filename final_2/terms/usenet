Arrows between clients and servers indicate that a user is subscribed to a certain group and reads or submits articles.]]\n\n'''Usenet''' is a worldwide distributed discussion system available on computers. It was developed from the general-purpose [[UUCP]] [[dial-up]] network architecture. [[Tom Truscott]] and [[Jim Ellis (computing)|Jim Ellis]] conceived the idea in 1979, and it was established in 1980.<ref name=\"Lueg\">''From Usenet to CoWebs: interacting with social information spaces'', Christopher Lueg, Danyel Fisher, Springer (2003), ISBN 1-85233-532-7, ISBN 978-1-85233-532-8</ref> Users read and post messages (called ''articles'' or ''posts'', and collectively termed ''news'') to one or more categories, known as [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroup]]s. Usenet resembles a [[bulletin board system]] (BBS) in many respects and is the precursor to [[Internet forum]]s that are widely used today. Usenet can be superficially regarded as a hybrid between [[email]] and web forums. Discussions are [[Threaded discussion|threaded]], as with web forums and BBSs, though posts are stored on the server sequentially. The name comes from the term \"users network\".<ref>[http://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-4.4.7.dos.txt The jargon file v4.4.7], Jargon File Archive.</ref><ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/~hauben/book/ch106.x03 Chapter 3 - The Social Forces Behind The Development of Usenet], Netizens Netbook by Ronda Hauben and  Michael Hauben.</ref>\n\nOne notable difference between a BBS or web forum and Usenet is the absence of a central server and dedicated administrator. Usenet is distributed among a large, constantly changing conglomeration of servers that store and forward messages to one another in so-called news feeds. Individual users may read messages from and post messages to a local server operated by a commercial usenet provider, their [[Internet service provider]], university, employer, or their own server.\n\n==Introduction==\nUsenet was conceived in 1979, and publicly established in 1980, at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and [[Duke University]],{{r|emerson198310}}<ref name=\"Lueg\" /> over a decade before the [[World Wide Web]] was developed and the general public received access to the [[Internet]], making it one of the oldest [[computer network]] communications systems still in widespread use. It was originally built on the \"poor man's [[ARPANET]]\", employing [[UUCP]] as its transport protocol to offer mail and file transfers, as well as announcements through the newly developed [[Newsreader (Usenet)|news software]] such as [[A News]]. The name Usenet emphasized its creators' hope that the [[USENIX]] organization would take an active role in its operation.<ref>[http://www.newsdemon.com/first-official-announcement-usenet.php \"Invitation to a General Access UNIX Network]\", James Ellis and Tom Truscott, in First Official Announcement of USENET, NewsDemon (K&L Technologies, Inc), 1979</ref>\n\nThe articles that users post to Usenet are organized into topical categories called [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroup]]s, which are themselves logically organized into hierarchies of subjects. For instance, ''[news:sci.math sci.math]'' and ''[news:sci.physics sci.physics]'' are within the ''sci.*'' hierarchy, for science. Or, ''[news:talk.origins talk.origins]'' and ''[news:talk.atheism talk.atheism]'' are in the ''talk.*'' hierarchy. When a user subscribes to a newsgroup, the [[news client]] software keeps track of which articles that user has read.<ref>Lehnert, Wendy G.; Kopec, Richard (2007). ''Web 101.'' Addison Wesley. p. 291. ISBN 9780321424679</ref>\n\nIn most newsgroups, the majority of the articles are responses to some other article. The set of articles that can be traced to one single non-reply article is called a [[Threaded discussion|thread]]. Most modern newsreaders display the articles arranged into threads and subthreads.\n\nWhen a user posts an article, it is initially only available on that user's news server. Each news server talks to one or more other servers (its \"newsfeeds\") and [[#Technical_details|exchanges]] articles with them. In this fashion, the article is copied from [[inter-server|server to server]] and should eventually reach every server in the network. The later [[peer-to-peer]] networks operate on a similar principle, but for Usenet it is normally the sender, rather than the receiver, who initiates transfers. Some{{who|date=August 2014}} have noted that this seems an inefficient protocol in the era of abundant high-speed network access. Usenet was designed under conditions when networks were much slower and not always available. Many sites on the original Usenet network would connect only once or twice a day to batch-transfer messages in and out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/15-849/store_and_forward.html |title=Store And Forward Communication: UUCP and FidoNet |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120630/http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/15-849/store_and_forward.html |archivedate=2012-06-30 |deadurl=no}}. Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science.</ref> This is largely because the [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] network was typically used for transfers, and phone charges were lower at night.\n\nUsenet has significant cultural importance in the networked world, having given rise to, or popularized, many widely recognized concepts and terms such as \"[[FAQ]]\", \"[[flaming (Internet)|flame]]\", and \"[[spam (electronic)|spam]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsdemon.com/usenet_term_spam.php| title=USENET Newsgroup Terms \u2013 SPAM |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120915/http://www.newsdemon.com/usenet_term_spam.php |archivedate=2012-09-15 |deadurl=no}}</ref>\n\nThe format and transmission of Usenet articles is similar to that of Internet [[e-mail]] messages. The difference between the two is that Usenet articles can be read by any user whose news server carries the group to which the message was posted, as opposed to email messages, which have one or more specific recipients.<ref>Kozierok, Charles M. (2005). ''The TCP/IP guide: a comprehensive, illustrated Internet protocols reference.'' No Starch Press. p. 1401. ISBN 978-159327-047-6</ref>\n\nToday, Usenet has diminished in importance with respect to [[Internet forum]]s, [[blog]]s and [[mailing list]]s. Usenet differs from such media in several ways: Usenet requires no personal registration with the group concerned; information need not be stored on a remote server; archives are always available; and reading the messages requires not a mail or web client, but a news client. The groups in ''[[alt.binaries]]'' are still widely used for data transfer.\n\n==ISPs, news servers, and newsfeeds==\nMany Internet service providers, and many other Internet sites, operate [[news server]]s for their users to access. ISPs that do not operate their own servers directly will often offer their users an account from another provider that specifically operates newsfeeds. In early news implementations, the server and newsreader were a single program suite, running on the same system. Today, one uses separate newsreader client software, a program that resembles an email client but accesses Usenet servers instead. Some clients such as [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] and [[Outlook Express]] provide both abilities.\n\nNot all ISPs run news servers. A news server is one of the most difficult Internet services to administer well because of the large amount of data involved, small customer base (compared to mainstream Internet services such as email and web access), and a disproportionately high volume of customer support incidents (frequently complaining of missing news articles that are not the ISP's fault). Some ISPs outsource news operation to specialist sites, which will usually appear to a user as though the ISP ran the server itself. Many sites carry a restricted newsfeed, with a limited number of newsgroups. Commonly omitted from such a newsfeed are foreign-language newsgroups and the ''[[alt.* hierarchy|alt.binaries]]'' hierarchy which largely carries software, music, videos and images, and accounts for over 99 percent of article data.\n\nThere are also Usenet providers that specialize in offering service to users whose ISPs do not carry news, or that carry a restricted feed.\n\nSee also [[news server operation]] for an overview of how news systems are implemented.\n\n===Newsreaders===\nNewsgroups are typically accessed with [[Newsreader (Usenet)|newsreader]]s: applications that allow users to read and reply to postings in newsgroups. These applications act as [[Client (computing)|client]]s to one or more news servers. Although historically, Usenet was associated with the [[Unix]] operating system developed at [[AT&T]], newsreaders are available for all major operating systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Internet/Clients/Usenet/ |title=Open Directory Usenet Clients |publisher=Dmoz.org |date=October 9, 2008 |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120730/http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Internet/Clients/Usenet/ |archivedate=2012-07-30 |deadurl=no}}</ref> Modern mail clients or \"communication suites\" commonly also have an integrated newsreader. Often, however, these integrated clients are of low quality, compared to standalone newsreaders, and incorrectly implement Usenet protocols, standards and conventions. Many of these integrated clients, for example the one in [[Microsoft]]'s Outlook Express, are disliked by purists because of their misbehavior.<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Jain\n| first = Dominik\n| title = OE-QuoteFix Description\n| date = July 30, 2006\n| url = http://home.in.tum.de/~jain/software/oe-quotefix/\n| accessdate =June 4, 2007 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120921/http://home.in.tum.de/~jain/software/oe-quotefix/ |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}</ref>\n\nWith the rise of the World Wide Web (WWW), web [[front end processor (program)|front-ends]] (web2news) have become more common.

The moderator is to receive submitted articles, review them, and inject approved articles so that they can be properly propagated worldwide. Articles approved by a moderator must bear the Approved: header line. Moderators ensure that the messages that readers see in the newsgroup conform to the charter of the newsgroup, though they are not required to follow any such rules or guidelines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.big-8.org/wiki/Moderated_Newsgroups#Who_can_force_the_moderators_to_obey_the_group_charter.3F |title=Who can force the moderators to obey the group charter? |publisher=Big-8.org |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120804/http://www.big-8.org/wiki/Moderated_Newsgroups%23Who_can_force_the_moderators_to_obey_the_group_charter.3F |archivedate=2012-08-04 |deadurl=no}}</ref> Typically, moderators are appointed in the proposal for the newsgroup, and changes of moderators follow a succession plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.big-8.org/wiki/Moderated_Newsgroups#How_does_a_group_change_moderators.3F |title=How does a group change moderators? |publisher=Big-8.org |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120719/http://www.big-8.org/wiki/Moderated_Newsgroups%23How_does_a_group_change_moderators.3F |archivedate=2012-07-19 |deadurl=no}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, a ''mod.*'' hierarchy existed before Usenet reorganization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livinginternet.com/u/ui_early.htm |title=Early Usenet Newsgroup Hierarchies |publisher=Livinginternet.com |date=October 25, 1990 |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120921/http://www.livinginternet.com/u/ui_early.htm |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}</ref> Now, moderated newsgroups may appear in any hierarchy, typically with <tt>.moderated</tt> added to the group name.\n\nUsenet newsgroups in the [[Big 8 (Usenet)|Big-8 hierarchy]] are created by proposals called a Request for Discussion, or RFD. The RFD is required to have the following information: newsgroup name, checkgroups file entry, and moderated or unmoderated status. If the group is to be moderated, then at least one moderator with a valid email address must be provided. Other information which is beneficial but not required includes: a charter, a rationale, and a moderation policy if the group is to be moderated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.big-8.org/wiki/How_to_Create_a_New_Big-8_Newsgroup |title=How to Create a New Big-8 Newsgroup |publisher=Big-8.org |date=July 7, 2010 |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120722/http://www.big-8.org/wiki/How_to_Create_a_New_Big-8_Newsgroup |archivedate=2012-07-22 |deadurl=no}}</ref> Discussion of the new newsgroup proposal follows, and is finished with the members of the Big-8 Management Board making the decision, by vote, to either approve or disapprove the new newsgroup.\n\nUnmoderated newsgroups form the majority of Usenet newsgroups, and messages submitted by readers for unmoderated newsgroups are immediately propagated for everyone to see. Minimal editorial content filtering vs propagation speed form one crux of the Usenet community. One little cited defense of propagation is canceling a propagated message, but few Usenet users use this command and some news readers do not offer [[Cancel message#cancel|cancellation commands]], in part because article storage expires in relatively short order anyway. Almost all unmoderated Usenet groups have become collections of [[spam (electronic)|spam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxaoAwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA168&ots=vsxrAQqzZx&dq=usenet%20spam%20prevalence&pg=PA168#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Social Machine: Designs for Living Online|quote=Today, Usenet still exists, but it is an unsociable morass of spam, porn, and pirated software}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/features-issue-sections/12223/markovian-parallax-denigrate-usenet-spam/|title=Unraveling the Internet\u2019s oldest and weirdest mystery|quote=Groups filled with spam, massive fights took place against spammers and over what to do about the spam.

These protocols most commonly use a [[flooding algorithm]] which propagates copies throughout a network of participating servers. Whenever a message reaches a server, that server forwards the message to all its network neighbors that haven't yet seen the article. Only one copy of a message is stored per server, and each server makes it available on demand to the (typically local) readers able to access that server. The collection of Usenet servers has thus a certain [[peer-to-peer]] character in that they share resources by exchanging them, the granularity of exchange however is on a different scale than a modern peer-to-peer system and this characteristic excludes the actual users of the system who connect to the news servers with a typical client-server application, much like an email reader.\n\nRFC 850 was the first formal specification of the messages exchanged by Usenet servers. It was superseded by RFC 1036 and subsequently by RFC 5536 and RFC 5537.\n\nIn cases where unsuitable content has been posted, Usenet has support for automated removal of a posting from the whole network by creating a cancel message, although due to a lack of authentication and resultant abuse, this capability is frequently disabled. Copyright holders may still request the manual deletion of infringing material using the provisions of [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] treaty implementations, such as the United States [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]], but this would require giving notice to each individual news server administrator.\n\nOn the Internet, Usenet is transported via the [[Network News Transfer Protocol]] (NNTP) on [[Computer port (software)|TCP Port]] 119 for standard, unprotected connections and on TCP port 563 for [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] encrypted connections which is offered only by a few sites.\n\n===Organization===\n[[File:Usenet Big Nine.svg|thumb|right|The \"Big Nine\" hierarchies of Usenet]]\n\nThe major set of worldwide newsgroups is contained within nine hierarchies, eight of which are operated under consensual guidelines that govern their administration and naming. The current ''[[Big 8 (Usenet)|Big Eight]]'' are:\n* ''comp.*'' \u2013 computer-related discussions (''comp.software'', ''comp.sys.amiga'')\n* ''humanities.*'' \u2013 [[fine art]]s, [[literature]], and [[philosophy]] (''humanities.classics'', ''humanities.design.misc'')\n* ''misc.*'' \u2013 miscellaneous topics (''misc.education'', ''misc.forsale'', ''misc.kids'')\n* ''news.*'' \u2013 discussions and announcements about news (meaning Usenet, not current events) (''news.groups'', ''news.admin'')\n* ''rec.*'' \u2013 recreation and entertainment (''rec.music'', ''rec.arts.movies'')\n* ''sci.*'' \u2013 science related discussions (''sci.psychology'', ''sci.research'')\n* ''soc.*'' \u2013 social discussions (''soc.college.org'', ''soc.culture.{{sic|hide=y|african}}'')\n* ''talk.*'' \u2013 talk about various controversial topics (''talk.religion'', ''talk.politics'', ''[[talk.origins]]'')\n\nSee also the [[Great Renaming]].\n\nThe [[alt.* hierarchy|''alt.*'' hierarchy]] is not subject to the procedures controlling groups in the Big Eight, and it is as a result less organized. Groups in the ''alt.*'' hierarchy tend to be more specialized or specific\u2014for example, there might be a newsgroup under the Big Eight which contains discussions about children's books, but a group in the alt hierarchy may be dedicated to one specific author of children's books. [[Binaries]] are posted in ''alt.binaries.*'', making it the largest of all the hierarchies.\n\nMany other hierarchies of newsgroups are distributed alongside these. Regional and language-specific hierarchies such as ''{{sic|hide=y|japan}}.*'', ''{{sic|hide=y|malta}}.*'' and ''ne.*'' serve specific countries and regions such as [[Japan]], [[Malta]] and [[New England]]. Companies and projects administer their own hierarchies to discuss their products and offer community technical support, such as the historical ''{{sic|hide=y|gnu}}.*'' hierarchy from the [[Free Software Foundation]]. [[Microsoft]] closed its newsserver in June 2010, providing support for its products over forums now.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/default.mspx Microsoft Responds to the Evolution of Communities], Announcement, undated. {{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-20004109-56.html |title=Microsoft hitting 'unsubscribe' on newsgroups |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120712/http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-20004109-56.html |archivedate=2012-07-12 |deadurl=no}}, CNET, May 4, 2010.</ref> Some users prefer to use the term \"Usenet\" to refer only to the Big Eight hierarchies; others include alt as well. The more general term \"netnews\" incorporates the entire medium, including private organizational news systems.\n\nInformal sub-hierarchy conventions also exist. ''*.answers'' are typically moderated cross-post groups for FAQs. An FAQ would be posted within one group and a cross post to the ''*.answers'' group at the head of the hierarchy seen by some as a refining of information in that news group. Some subgroups are recursive\u2014to the point of some silliness in ''alt.*''{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}.\n\n===Binary content===\n[[File:Usenet Binaries Upload process.PNG|thumb|300px|A visual example of the many complex steps required to prepare data to be uploaded to Usenet newsgroups. These steps must be done again in reverse to download data from Usenet.]]\n\nUsenet was originally created to distribute text content encoded in the 7-[[bit]] [[ASCII]] character set. With the help of programs that encode 8-bit values into ASCII, it became practical to distribute [[binary file]]s as content. Binary posts, due to their size and often-dubious copyright status, were in time restricted to specific newsgroups, making it easier for administrators to allow or disallow the traffic.\n\nThe oldest widely used encoding method for binary content is [[uuencode]], from the [[Unix]] UUCP package. In the late 1980s, Usenet articles were often limited to 60,000 characters, and larger hard limits exist today. Files are therefore commonly split into sections that require reassembly by the reader.\n\nWith the header extensions and the [[Base64]] and Quoted-Printable [[MIME]] encodings, there was a new generation of binary transport. In practice, MIME has seen increased adoption in text messages, but it is avoided for most binary attachments. Some operating systems with [[metadata (computing)|metadata]] attached to files use specialized encoding formats. For Mac OS, both [[Binhex]] and special MIME types are used.\n\nOther lesser known encoding systems that may have been used at one time were [[BTOA]], [[Xxencode|XX encoding]], [[BOO (encoding)|BOO]], and [[USR encoding]].\n\nIn an attempt to reduce file transfer times, an informal file encoding known as [[yEnc]] was introduced in 2001. It achieves about a 30% reduction in data transferred by assuming that most 8-bit characters can safely be transferred across the network without first encoding into the 7-bit ASCII space.\n\nThe most common method of uploading large binary posts to Usenet is to convert the files into [[RAR (file format)|RAR]] archives and create [[Parchive]] files for them. Parity files are used to recreate missing data when not every part of the files reaches a server.\n\n====Binary retention time====\n[[File:Usenet-total-storage.jpg|thumb|300px|This is a list of some of the biggest binary groups. With 1341+ days retention, the (binary) Usenet storage (which binsearch.info indexes) is more than 33 [[petabyte]]s 33000 [[terabyte]]s).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.binsearch.info/groupinfo.php |title=Usenet storage is more than 33 petabytes (33000 terabytes) |publisher=binsearch.info |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120921/https://www.binsearch.info/groupinfo.php |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}</ref>]]\n\nEach news server generally allocates a certain amount of storage space for post content in each newsgroup. When this storage has been filled, each time a new post arrives, old posts are deleted to make room for the new content. If the network bandwidth available to a server is high but the storage allocation is small, it is possible for a huge flood of incoming content to overflow the allocation and push out everything that was in the group before it. If the flood is large enough, the beginning of the flood will begin to be deleted even before the last part of the flood has been posted.\n\nBinary newsgroups are only able to function reliably if there is sufficient storage allocated to a group to allow readers enough time to download all parts of a binary posting before it is flushed out of the group's storage allocation. This was at one time how posting of undesired content was countered; the newsgroup would be flooded with random garbage data posts, of sufficient quantity to push out all the content to be suppressed. This has been compensated by service providers allocating enough storage to retain everything posted each day, including such spam floods, without deleting anything.\n\nThe average length of time that posts are able to stay in the group before being deleted is commonly called the ''retention time''. Generally the larger Usenet servers have enough capacity to archive several years of binary content even when flooded with new data at the maximum daily speed available. A good binaries service provider must not only accommodate users of fast connections (3 megabit) but also users of slow connections (256 kilobit or less) who need more time to download content over a period of several days or weeks.\n\nMajor NSPs have a retention time of more than 4 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.giganews.com/faq.html#q0.4 |title=Giganews FAQ \u2013 How long are articles available? |publisher=Giganews.com |accessdate=October 23, 2012 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120904/http://www.giganews.com/faq.html%23q0.4 |archivedate=2012-09-04 |deadurl=no}}</ref>\nThis results in more than 33 [[petabyte]]s (33000 [[terabyte]]s) of storage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.giganews.com/blog/2011/05/announcing-1000-days-retention-prize.html\n |title=9 petabyte of usenet storage on giganews.com |publisher=giganews.com |accessdate=February 14, 2012 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120921/http://www.giganews.com/blog/2011/05/announcing-1000-days-retention-prize.html |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}</ref>\n\nIn part because of such long retention times, as well as growing Internet [[upload]] speeds, Usenet is also used by individual users to store [[backup]] data in a practice called ''Usenet backup'', or uBackup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Backup-Your-Data-on-Usenet-%28Ubackup%29 |title=usenet backup (uBackup) |publisher=Wikihow.com |accessdate=February 14, 2012 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120918/http://www.wikihow.com/Backup-Your-Data-on-Usenet-%28Ubackup%29 |archivedate=2012-09-18 |deadurl=no}}</ref> While commercial providers offer more [[ease of use|easy to use]] [[List of online backup services|online backup services]], storing data on Usenet is free of charge (although access to Usenet itself may not be). The method requires the user to [[Backup#Data repository models|manually select, prepare and upload the data]]. Because anyone can potentially download the backup files, the data is typically [[encryption|encrypted]]. After the files are uploaded, the uploader does not have any control over them; the files are automatically copied to all Usenet providers, so there will be multiple copies of it spread over different geographical locations around the world\u2014desirable in a backup scheme.\n\n====Legal issues====\nWhile binary newsgroups can be used to distribute completely legal user-created works, open-source software, and public domain material, some binary groups are used to illegally distribute commercial software, copyrighted media, and obscene material.\n\nISP-operated Usenet servers frequently block access to all ''alt.binaries.*'' groups to both reduce network traffic and to avoid related legal issues. Commercial Usenet service providers claim to operate as a telecommunications service, and assert that they are not responsible for the user-posted binary content transferred via their equipment. In the United States, Usenet providers can qualify for protection under the [[DMCA]] [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act|Safe Harbor regulations]], provided that they establish a mechanism to comply with and respond to takedown notices from copyright holders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.supernews.com/docs/dmca.html |title=Digital Millenium Copyright Act|archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120910/http://www.supernews.com/docs/dmca.html |archivedate=2012-09-10 |deadurl=no}}</ref>\n\nRemoval of copyrighted content from the entire Usenet network is a nearly impossible task, due to the rapid propagation between servers and the retention done by each server. Petitioning a Usenet provider for removal only removes it from that one server's retention cache, but not any others. It is possible for a special ''post cancellation'' message to be distributed to remove it from all servers, but many providers ignore [[Cancel message|cancel]] messages by standard policy, because they can be easily falsified and submitted by anyone.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cancel Messages FAQ |url=http://wiki.killfile.org/projects/usenet/faqs/cancel/|accessdate=June 29, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215161039/http://www.killfile.org/faqs/cancel.html |archivedate=February 15, 2008 |quote=...Until authenticated cancels catch on, there are no options to avoid forged cancels and allow unforged ones...}}</ref><ref>Microsoft knowledgebase article stating that many servers ignore cancel messages {{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q164420/ |title=Support.microsoft.com |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120719/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q164420/ |archivedate=2012-07-19 |deadurl=no}}</ref> For a takedown petition to be most effective across the whole network, it would have to be issued to the origin server to which the content has been posted, before it has been propagated to other servers. Removal of the content at this early stage would prevent further propagation, but with modern high speed links, content can be propagated as fast as it arrives, allowing no time for content review and takedown issuance by copyright holders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.measurement.sk/2005/S1/Surmacz.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Surmacz.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=December 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\nEstablishing the identity of the person posting illegal content is equally difficult due to the trust-based design of the network. Like [[SMTP]] email, servers generally assume the header and origin information in a post is true and accurate. However, as in SMTP email, Usenet post headers are easily falsified so as to obscure the true identity and location of the message source.<ref>''...every part of a Usenet post may be forged apart from the left most portion of the \"Path:\" header...'' {{cite web |url=http://www.by-users.co.uk/faqs/email/headers/ |title=By-users.co.uk |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120723/http://www.by-users.co.uk/faqs/email/headers/ |archivedate=2012-07-23 |deadurl=no}}</ref> In this manner, Usenet is significantly different from modern P2P services; most P2P users distributing content are typically immediately identifiable to all other users by their network address, but the origin information for a Usenet posting can be completely obscured and unobtainable once it has propagated past the original server.<ref>{{cite newsgroup|message-id=StUPidfuk01@uunet.uu.net|newsgroup=news.admin.misc|title=Better living through forgery |url=http://groups.google.com/group/news.admin.misc/msg/9f6aa173f228ac6a?dmode=source&output=gplain|date=1995-06-10 |accessdate=December 5, 2014|archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120724/http://groups.google.com/group/news.admin.misc/msg/9f6aa173f228ac6a?dmode=source&output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-24 |deadurl=no}}</ref>\n\nAlso unlike modern P2P services, the identity of the downloaders is hidden from view. On P2P services a downloader is identifiable to all others by their network address. On Usenet, the downloader connects directly to a server, and only the server knows the address of who is connecting to it. Some Usenet providers do keep usage logs, but not all make this logged information casually available to outside parties such as the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.giganews.com/legal/privacy.html |title=Giganews Privacy Policy |publisher=Giganews.com |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120731/http://www.giganews.com/legal/privacy.html |archivedate=2012-07-31 |deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aioe.org/index.php?logging-policy |title=Logging Policy |publisher=Aioe.org |date=June 9, 2005 |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120708/http://aioe.org/index.php?logging-policy |archivedate=2012-07-08 |deadurl=no}}</ref> The existence of anonymising gateways to USENET also complicates the tracing of a postings true origin.\n\n==History==\n<div class=\"noprint\" style=\"clear:right; border:solid #aaa 1px; margin:0 0 1em 1em; background:#f9f9f9; padding:4px; spacing:0; text-align:left; float:right;\"><small><pre>\nUUCP/Usenet Logical Map  \u2014   June 1, 1981 / mods by S.

[[Tom Truscott]] and [[Jim Ellis (computing)|Jim Ellis]] of [[Duke University]] came up with the idea as a replacement for a local announcement program, and established a link with nearby [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] using [[Bourne shell]] scripts written by [[Steve Bellovin]]. The public release of [[A News|news]] was in the form of conventional compiled [[software]], written by Steve Daniel and Truscott.<ref name=\"emerson198310\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-10/1983_10_BYTE_08-10_UNIX#page/n219/mode/2up | title=Usenet / A Bulletin Board for Unix Users | work=BYTE | date=October 1983 | accessdate=31 January 2015 | author=Emerson, Sandra L. | pages=219\u2013236}}</ref><ref>LaQuey, Tracy (1990).

[[Mary Ann Horton|Mark Horton]], the graduate student who set up the connection, began \"feeding mailing lists from the ARPANET into Usenet\" with the \"fa\" (\"From ARPANET\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oreillynet.com/network/2001/12/21/usenet.html|title=And So It Begins}}</ref>) identifier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/history/ivh/chap3.htm|title=History of the Internet, Chapter Three: History of Electronic Mail}}</ref> Usenet gained 50 member sites in its first year, including [[Reed College]], [[University of Oklahoma]], and [[Bell Labs]],{{r|emerson198310}} and the number of people using the network increased dramatically; however, it was still a while longer before Usenet users could contribute to ARPANET.<ref>Hauben, Michael and Hauben, Ronda. \"[http://www.columbia.edu/~rh120/ Netizens: On the History and Impact of Usenet and the Internet, On the Early Days of Usenet: The Roots of the Cooperative Online Culture]\". First Monday vol. 3 num.August 8, 3 1998</ref>\n\n===Network===\nUUCP networks spread quickly due to the lower costs involved, and the ability to use existing leased lines, [[X.25]] links or even [[ARPANET]] connections. By 1983, thousands of people participated from more than 500 hosts, mostly universities and Bell Labs sites but also a growing number of Unix-related companies; the number of hosts nearly doubled to 940 in 1984. More than 100 newsgroups existed, more than 20 devoted to Unix and other computer-related topics, and at least a third to recreation.<ref>Haddadi, H. (2006). \"[http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~hamed/papers/mphil.pdf Network Traffic Inference Using Sampled Statistics]\". University College London.</ref>{{r|emerson198310}} As the mesh of UUCP hosts rapidly expanded, it became desirable to distinguish the Usenet subset from the overall network. A vote was taken at the 1982 USENIX conference to choose a new name. The name Usenet was retained, but it was established that it only applied to news.<ref>{{cite web| last = Horton| first = Mark| title = Arachnet| date = December 11, 1990 |url = http://communication.ucsd.edu/bjones/Usenet.Hist/Nethist/0111.html |accessdate=4 June 2007 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120921/http://communication.ucsd.edu/bjones/Usenet.Hist/Nethist/0111.html |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}</ref> The name UUCPNET became the common name for the overall network.\n\nIn addition to UUCP, early Usenet traffic was also exchanged with [[Fidonet]] and other dial-up [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] networks. Widespread use of Usenet by the BBS community was facilitated by the introduction of [[UUCP]] feeds made possible by MS-DOS implementations of UUCP, such as UFGATE (UUCP to FidoNet Gateway), FSUUCP and UUPC. In 1986, RFC 977 provided the [[Network News Transfer Protocol]] (NNTP) specification for distribution of Usenet articles over [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] as a more flexible alternative to informal Internet transfers of UUCP traffic. Since the Internet boom of the 1990s, almost all Usenet distribution is over NNTP.<ref>Huston, Geoff (1999). ''ISP survival guide: strategies for running a competitive ISP.'' Wiley. p. 439.</ref>\n\n===Software===\nEarly versions of Usenet used Duke's [[A News]] software, designed for one or two articles a day. Matt Glickman and Horton at Berkeley produced an improved version called [[B News]] that could handle the rising traffic (about 50 articles a day as of late 1983).{{r|emerson198310}} With a message format that offered compatibility with Internet mail and improved performance, it became the dominant server software. [[C News]], developed by [[Geoff Collyer]] and [[Henry Spencer]] at the [[University of Toronto]], was comparable to B News in features but offered considerably faster processing. In the early 1990s, [[InterNetNews]] by [[Rich Salz]] was developed to take advantage of the continuous message flow made possible by NNTP versus the batched store-and-forward design of UUCP. Since that time [[InterNetNews|INN]] development has continued, and other news server software has also been developed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsreaders.com/unix/servers.html |title=Unix/Linux news servers |publisher=Newsreaders.com |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120905/http://www.newsreaders.com/unix/servers.html |archivedate=2012-09-05 |deadurl=no}}</ref>\n\n===Public venue===\nUsenet was the first Internet community and the place for many of the most important public developments in the pre-commercial Internet.

Segan said that some people pointed to the [[Eternal September]] in 1993 as the beginning of Usenet's decline. Segan believes that when pornographers and software [[Copyright infringement|crackers]] began putting large files on Usenet by the late 1990s, Usenet [[disk space]] and traffic increased correspondingly.
