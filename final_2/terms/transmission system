The signal can be an [[Signal (electrical engineering)|electrical]], optical or [[Radio wave|radio signal]].\n\nSome transmission systems contain multipliers, which amplify a signal prior to re-transmission, or [[Regenerator (telecommunication)|regenerators]], which attempt to reconstruct and re-shape the coded message before re-transmission.\n\nOne of the most widely used transmission system technologies in the [[Internet]] and the [[PSTN]] is [[SONET]].\n\nAlso, transmission system is the medium through which data is transmitted from one point to another. Examples of common transmission systems people use everyday are: the internet, [[mobile network]], cordless cables, etc.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Communications satellite]]\n* [[Submarine communications cable]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Transmission System}}\n[[Category:Telecommunications systems]]\n\n\nIn order to propel the vehicle, a particular type of speed and power changing device is required to transfer the power developed by engine to the driving wheel due to constantly changing requirement demand on the engine and inherent limitation is called transmisssion, and this system is called transmission system.\n\n{{telecomm-stub}}"}]}}}}
