Mechanochemistry can be seen as an interface between [[chemistry]] and [[mechanical engineering]]. It is possible to synthesize chemical products by using only mechanical action. The mechanisms of mechanochemical transformations are often complex and different from usual thermal or photochemical mechanisms.<ref name=hickenboth2007>{{cite journal |first1=Charles R. |last1=Hickenboth |first2=Jeffrey S. |last2=Moore |first3=Scott R. |last3=White |first4=Nancy R. |last4=Sottos |first5=Jerome |last5=Baudry1 |first6=Scott R. |last6=Wilson |year=2007 |title=Biasing Reaction Pathways with Mechanical Force, |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=446 |issue= 7134|pages=423&ndash;427 |publisher= |doi=10.1038/nature05681 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v446/n7134/full/nature05681.html |accessdate=20 June 2013 |pmid=17377579}}{{subscription required}}</ref><ref>Carlier L. & al. , Greener pharmacy using solvent-free synthesis: investigation of the mechanism in the case of dibenzophenazine, Powder Technol. 2013,  240, 41-47.</ref> The method of [[ball mill]]ing is a widely used process in which mechanical force is used to achieve chemical processing and transformations.<ref>Carlier L. & al. , Use of co-grinding as a solvent-free solid state method to synthesize dibenzophenazines, Tetrahedron Let. 2011,  52, 4686-4689.</ref> The special issue of Chemical Society Review (vol. 42, 2013) is dedicated to the theme of mechanochemistry.

The oldest method of making fire is to rub pieces of wood against each other, creating friction and hence heat, allowing the wood to undergo combustion at a high temperature.  Another method involves the use of [[flint and steel]], during which a [[Ember|spark]] (a small particle of [[pyrophoric]] metal) spontaneously combusts in air, starting fire instantaneously.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mechanoluminescence]]\n* [[Tribology]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Lenhardt, J.
