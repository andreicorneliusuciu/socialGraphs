The word ''clock'' is derived ultimately (via [[Dutch language|Dutch]], Northern French, and [[Medieval Latin]]) from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] words ''clagan'' and ''clocca'' meaning \"[[Bell (instrument)|bell]]\". A silent instrument missing such a [[striking clock|striking]] mechanism has traditionally been known as a '''timepiece'''.<ref>see Baillie et al., p. 307; Palmer, p. 19; Zea & Cheney, p. 172</ref> In general usage today a \"clock\" refers to any device for measuring and displaying the time.

Devices operating on several physical processes have been used over the millennia. A [[sundial]] shows the time by displaying the position of a shadow on a flat surface. There are a range of duration timers, a well-known example being the [[hourglass]]. [[Water clock]]s, along with the sundials, are possibly the oldest time-measuring instruments.

During the 15th and 16th centuries, clockmaking flourished. The next development in accuracy occurred after 1656 with the invention of the [[pendulum clock]]. A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The [[electric clock]] was patented in 1840. The development of [[electronics]] in the 20th century led to clocks with no clockwork parts at all.\n\nThe timekeeping element in every modern clock is a [[harmonic oscillator]], a physical object ([[resonator]]) that vibrates or [[oscillate]]s repetitively at a precisely constant [[frequency]].<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\nThis object can be a [[pendulum]], a [[tuning fork]], a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]], or the vibration of [[electron]]s in [[atom]]s as they emit [[microwave]]s. Analog clocks usually indicate time using angles. Digital clocks display a numeric representation of time. Two numeric display formats are commonly used on [[Digital data|digital]] clocks: 24-hour notation and 12-hour notation. Most digital clocks use electronic mechanisms and [[LCD]], [[LED]], or [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays. For convenience, distance, telephony or [[blindness]], auditory clocks present the time as sounds.  There are also clocks for the blind that have displays that can be read by using the sense of touch. Some of these are similar to normal analog displays, but are constructed so the hands can be felt without damaging them. The evolution of the technology of clocks continues today.\n\nThe study of timekeeping is known as [[horology]].\n\n==History==\n{{main article|History of timekeeping devices}}\n\n==Time-measuring devices==\n<!--Linked from [[Template:Time topics]]-->\n\n===Sundials===\n[[File:Garden sundial MN 2007.JPG|thumb|150px|Simple horizontal sundial.]]\nWhen the [[Sun]] is shining, its apparent position in the sky moves during a day, reflecting the rotation of the Earth. Shadows cast by stationary objects move correspondingly, so their positions can be used to indicate the time of day. A [[sundial]] shows the time by displaying the position of a shadow on a (usually) flat surface, which has markings that correspond to the hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=How Sundials Work|url=http://sundialsoc.org.uk/discussions/how-do-sundials-work/|publisher=The British Sundial Society|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> Sundials can be horizontal, vertical, or in other orientations.  Sundials were widely used in [[Ancient history|ancient times]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ancient Sundials|url=http://sundials.org/index.php/all-things-sundial/ancient-sundials|publisher=North American Sundial Society|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>  With the knowledge of latitude, a well-constructed sundial can measure local [[solar time]] with reasonable accuracy, within a minute or two. Sundials continued to be used to monitor the performance of clocks until the [[modern era]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} However, practical limitations, such as that sundials work only when the Sun shines, and never during the night, encouraged the use of other techniques for measuring and displaying time.\n\n===Devices that measure duration, elapsed time and/or intervals===\n[[File:Wooden hourglass 3.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The flow of [[sand]] in an [[hourglass]] can be used to keep track of elapsed time.]]\nMany devices can be used to mark passage of time without respect to reference time (time of day, minutes, etc...) and can be useful for measuring duration and/or intervals.  Examples of such duration timers are, [[candle clock]]s, [[incense clock]]s and the [[hourglass]].  Both the candle clock and the incense clock work on the same principle wherein the consumption of resources is more or less constant allowing reasonably precise, and repeatable, estimates of time passages.  In the hourglass, fine [[sand]] pouring through a tiny hole at a constant rate indicates an arbitrary, predetermined, passage of time, the resource is not consumed but re-used.\n\n===Water clocks===\n{{main article|Water Clock}}\n[[File:SuSongClock1.JPG|thumb|right|A [[scale model]] of [[Su Song]]'s [[Astronomical]] Clock Tower, built in 11th century [[Kaifeng]], [[China]]. It was driven by a large [[waterwheel]], [[chain drive]], and [[escapement]] mechanism.]]\nWater clocks, also known as clepsydrae (sg: ''clepsydra''), along with the sundials, are possibly the oldest time-measuring instruments, with the only exceptions being the vertical [[gnomon]] and the day counting [[tally stick]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1984|p=1}}</ref> Given their great antiquity, where and when they first existed is not known and perhaps unknowable. The bowl-shaped outflow is the simplest form of a water clock and is known to have existed in [[Babylon]] and in [[Egypt]] around the 16th century BC. Other regions of the world, including [[India]] and [[China]], also have early evidence of water clocks, but the earliest dates are less certain. Some authors, however, write about water clocks appearing as early as 4000 BC in these regions of the world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cowan|1958|p=58}}</ref>\n\n[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] astronomer [[Andronicus of Cyrrhus]] supervised the construction of the [[Tower of the Winds]] in Athens in the 1st century B.C.<ref>[http://www.sailingissues.com/yachting-guide/tower-of-winds-1.html Tower of the Winds \u2013 Athens]</ref>\n\nThe [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] civilizations are credited for initially advancing water clock design to include complex [[gear]]ing, which was connected to fanciful [[automaton|automata]] and also resulted in improved accuracy. These advances were passed on through [[Byzantium]] and [[Islamic]] times, eventually making their way back to [[Europe]]. Independently, the Chinese developed their own advanced water clocks\uff08\u6c34\u9418\uff09in 725 A.D., passing their ideas on to [[Korea]] and [[Japan]].\n\nSome water clock designs were developed independently and some knowledge was transferred through the spread of trade. [[Pre-modern]] societies do not have the same precise timekeeping requirements that exist in modern [[industrialism|industrial]] societies, where every hour of work or rest is monitored, and work may start or finish at any time regardless of external conditions. Instead, water clocks in ancient societies were used mainly for [[astrology|astrological]] reasons. These early water clocks were calibrated with a [[sundial]]. While never reaching the level of accuracy of a modern timepiece, the water clock was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for millennia, until it was replaced by the more accurate [[pendulum clock]] in 17th-century Europe.\n\nIslamic civilization is credited with further advancing the accuracy of clocks with elaborate engineering. In 797 (or possibly 801), the [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]] of [[Baghdad]], [[Harun al-Rashid]], presented [[Charlemagne]] with an [[Asian Elephant]] named [[Abul-Abbas]] together with a \"particularly elaborate example\" of a water<ref>{{cite book | last = James | first = Peter | title = Ancient Inventions | year = 1995 | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-345-40102-6 | page = 126 | publisher = Ballantine Books}}</ref> clock.\n\n[[Pope Sylvester II]] introduced clocks to northern and western Europe around 1000AD<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876|page=232}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Al-jazari elephant clock.png|thumb|right|200px|An [[elephant clock]] in a manuscript by [[Al-Jazari]] (1206 AD) from ''The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices''.<ref>[[Ibn al-Razzaz Al-Jazari]] (ed. 1974), ''The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices''.

The book described 50 mechanical devices in 6 categories, including water clocks. The most reputed clocks included [[Elephant clock|the Elephant]], Scribe and [[Castle clock]]s, all of which have been successfully reconstructed.

The world's first [[escapement]] mechanism had been invented and used in medieval [[History of Science and Technology in China|China]], as the [[Song dynasty]] [[polymath]] and [[genius]] [[Su Song]] (1020\u20131101) incorporated it into his monumental innovation of the astronomical clock-tower of [[Kaifeng]] in 1088.<ref>History of Song \u5b8b\u53f2, Vol. 340</ref>{{Page needed|date=July 2011}} His astronomical clock and rotating [[armillary sphere]] still relied on the use of either flowing water during the spring, summer, autumn seasons and [[mercury (element)|liquid mercury]] during the freezing temperature of winter (i.e. [[hydraulics]]), while 600 years later [[Europe]]an clockworks of the 14th and 15th centuries shed this method for a more efficient driving power of weights, in addition to the [[History of Science and Technology in China|Han Chinese]] [[escapement]] mechanism.\n\nA mercury clock, described in the ''Libros del saber'', a Spanish work from 1277 consisting of translations and paraphrases of Arabic works, is sometimes quoted as evidence for Muslim knowledge of a mechanical clock.

Existing clock mechanisms that used [[Hydropower|water power]] were being adapted to take their driving power from falling weights. This power was controlled by some form of oscillating mechanism, probably derived from existing bell-ringing or alarm devices. This controlled release of power\u2014the [[escapement]]\u2014marks the beginning of the true mechanical clock.\n\nThese mechanical clocks were intended for two main purposes: for signalling and notification (e.g. the timing of services and public events), and for modeling the [[solar system]]. The former purpose is administrative, the latter arises naturally given the scholarly interests in astronomy, science, astrology, and how these subjects integrated with the religious philosophy of the time. The [[astrolabe]] was used both by astronomers and astrologers, and it was natural to apply a clockwork drive to the rotating plate to produce a working model of the solar system.\n\nSimple clocks intended mainly for notification were installed in towers, and did not always require faces or hands. They would have announced the [[canonical hours]] or intervals between set times of prayer. Canonical hours varied in length as the times of sunrise and sunset shifted. The more sophisticated astronomical clocks would have had moving dials or hands, and would have shown the time in various time systems, including [[Hour#Counting from sunset|Italian hours]], canonical hours, and time as measured by astronomers at the time. Both styles of clock started acquiring extravagant features such as [[automata]].\n\nIn 1283, a large clock was installed at [[Dunstable Priory]]; its location above the [[rood screen]] suggests that it was not a water clock.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} In 1292, [[Canterbury Cathedral]] installed a 'great horloge'. Over the next 30 years there are mentions of clocks at a number of ecclesiastical institutions in England, Italy, and France. In 1322, a new clock was installed in [[Norwich]], an expensive replacement for an earlier clock installed in 1273. This had a large (2 metre) astronomical dial with automata and bells. The costs of the installation included the full-time employment of two [[clockkeeper]]s for two years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\n===Astronomical clocks===\n[[File:Abbot Richard Wallingford.jpg|thumb|right|[[Richard of Wallingford]] pointing to a clock, his gift to [[St Albans Abbey]].]]\n[[File:Clock machine 16th century-Convent of Christ,Tomar, Portugal.jpg|thumb|16th century clock machine [[Convent of Christ]],Tomar, Portugal.]]\nBesides the Chinese astronomical clock of Su Song in 1088 mentioned above, in Europe there were the clocks constructed by [[Richard of Wallingford]] in [[St Albans]] by 1336, and by Giovanni [[Giovanni Dondi dell'Orologio|de Dondi]] in [[Padua, Italy|Padua]] from 1348 to 1364.

In addition, it had a [[Rota Fortunae|wheel of fortune]] and an indicator of the state of the tide at [[London Bridge]]. Bells rang every hour, the number of strokes indicating the time.<ref name=\"north\"/>\n\nDondi's clock was a seven-sided construction, 1 metre high, with dials showing the time of day, including minutes, the motions of all the known planets, an automatic calendar of fixed and [[Moveable feast|movable feasts]], and an eclipse prediction hand rotating once every 18 years.<ref name=\"king\"/>\n\nIt is not known how accurate or reliable these clocks would have been. They were probably adjusted manually every day to compensate for errors caused by wear and imprecise manufacture.\nWater clocks are sometimes still used today, and can be examined in places such as ancient castles and museums.\n\nThe [[Salisbury cathedral clock|Salisbury Cathedral clock]], built in 1386, is considered to be the world's oldest surviving mechanical clock that strikes the hours.<ref>Singer, Charles, et al.

[[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] had the idea to use a swinging bob to regulate the motion of a time-telling device earlier in the 17th century. [[Christiaan Huygens]], however, is usually credited as the inventor. He determined the mathematical formula that related pendulum length to time (99.38&nbsp;cm or 39.13&nbsp;inches for the one second movement) and had the first pendulum-driven clock made. The first model clock was built in 1657 in [[the Hague]], but it was in [[England]] that the idea was taken up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=2324&HistoryID=ac08&gtrack=pthc|title=History of Clocks}}</ref> The [[longcase clock]] (also known as the ''grandfather clock'') was created to house the pendulum and works by the English clockmaker William Clement in 1670 or 1671.

The concentric minute hand was added to the clock by [[Daniel Quare]], a London clock-maker and others, and the Second Hand was first introduced.\n\n===Hairspring===\nIn 1675, Huygens and [[Robert Hooke]] invented the [[spiral balance]], or the hairspring, designed to control the oscillating speed of the [[balance wheel]]. This crucial advance finally made accurate pocket watches possible. The great English clockmaker, [[Thomas Tompion]], was one of the first to use this mechanism successfully in his [[pocket watch]]es, and he adopted the minute hand which, after a variety of designs were trialled, eventually stabilised into the modern-day configuration.<ref>{{cite web|title=History Of Clocks|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=2324&HistoryID=ac08&gtrack=pthc}}</ref>\n\nThe Rev. [[Edward Barlow (priest)|Edward Barlow]] invented the rack and snail striking mechanism for [[striking clock]]s, which was a great improvement over the previous mechanism. The [[repeater (horology)|repeating clock]], that chimes the number of hours (or even minutes) was invented by either Quare or Barlow in 1676. [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] invented the [[Escapement#Deadbeat escapement|deadbeat escapement]] for clocks in 1720.\n\n===Marine chronometer===\n[[File:Harrison H4 clock in The principles of Mr Harrison's time-keeper 1767.jpg|thumb|right|Drawings of Harrison's H4 chronometer of 1761, published in ''The principles of Mr Harrison's time-keeper'', 1767.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aB8OAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover The principles of Mr Harrison's time-keeper]''</ref>]]\nA major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.

[[John Harrison]], who dedicated his life to improving the accuracy of his clocks, later received considerable sums under the Longitude Act.\n\nIn 1735, Harrison built his first chronometer, which he steadily improved on over the next thirty years before submitting it for examination. The clock had many innovations, including the use of bearings to reduce friction, weighted balances to compensate for the ship's pitch and roll in the sea and the use of two different metals to reduce the problem of expansion from heat.\n\nThe chronometer was tested in 1761 by Harrison's son and by the end of 10 weeks the clock was in error by less than 5 seconds.<ref name=gould>{{cite book|author=Gould, Rupert T.|authorlink=Rupert Gould|title=The Marine Chronometer.

The electric clock's mainspring is wound either with an [[electric motor]] or with an [[electromagnet]] and armature. In 1841, he first patented the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] pendulum.\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, the advent of the dry cell battery made it feasible to use electric power in clocks. Spring or weight driven clocks that use electricity, either [[alternating current]] (AC) or [[direct current]] (DC), to rewind the spring or raise the weight of a mechanical clock would be classified as an [[electromechanical clock]]. This classification would also apply to clocks that employ an electrical impulse to propel the pendulum. In electromechanical clocks the electricity serves no time keeping function. These types of clocks were made as individual timepieces but more commonly used in synchronized time installations in schools, businesses, factories, railroads and government facilities as a [[master clock]] and [[slave clocks]].\n\nElectric clocks that are powered from the [[Alternating current|AC]] supply often use [[synchronous motor]]s. The supply current alternates with a frequency of exactly 50&nbsp;[[hertz]] in many countries, and 60&nbsp;hertz in others. The [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] of the motor rotates at a speed that is exactly related to the alternation frequency. Appropriate gearing converts this rotation speed to the correct ones for the hands of the analog clock.\n\nThe development of [[electronics]] in the 20th century led to clocks with no clockwork parts at all. Time in these cases is measured in several ways, such as by the alternation of the AC supply, vibration of a [[tuning fork]], the behaviour of [[quartz]] crystals, or the quantum vibrations of atoms. Electronic circuits divide these high-frequency oscillations to slower ones that drive the time display.  Even mechanical clocks have since come to be largely powered by batteries, removing the need for winding.\n\n===Quartz clocks===\nThe [[piezoelectric]] properties of crystalline [[quartz]] were discovered by [[Jacques Curie|Jacques]] and [[Pierre Curie]] in 1880.<ref name=nistrevolution>{{cite web|url= http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/revol.html |title= A Revolution in Timekeeping |accessdate= 30 April 2008 |publisher= NIST| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409174853/http://physics.nist.gov/GenInt/Time/revol.html | archivedate = April 9, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/history/curie/pierre.htm |title=Pierre Curie |accessdate=8 April 2008|publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]]}}</ref> The first crystal oscillator was invented in 1917 by [[Alexander M.

All modern clocks use oscillation.\n\nAlthough the methods they use vary, all oscillating clocks, mechanical and digital and atomic, work similarly and can be divided into analogous parts.<ref name=\"Jespersen\">{{cite book|last=Jespersen|first=James|author2=Fitz-Randolph, Jane |author3=Robb, John |title=From Sundials to Atomic Clocks: Understanding Time and Frequency|publisher=Courier Dover|year=1999|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&pg=PA42&dq=clock+resonance+pendulum|isbn=0-486-40913-9|page=39}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How clocks work|work=InDepthInfo|publisher=W.

Attached to the oscillator is a ''controller'' device, which sustains the oscillator's motion by replacing the energy it loses to [[friction]], and converts its oscillations into a series of pulses. The pulses are then counted by some type of ''counter'', and the number of counts is converted into convenient units, usually seconds, minutes, hours, etc. Finally some kind of ''indicator'' displays the result in human readable form.\n\n===Power source===\n\n[[File:Mainspring wind-up keys.jpg|thumb|left|Keys of various sizes for winding up mainsprings on clocks.]]\nThis provides power to keep the clock going.\n*In mechanical clocks, the power source is typically either a weight suspended from a cord or chain wrapped around a [[pulley]], [[sprocket]] or drum; or a spiral [[Spring (device)|spring]] called a [[mainspring]].  Mechanical clocks must be ''wound'' periodically, usually by turning a knob or key or by pulling on the free end of the chain, to store [[energy]] in the weight or spring to keep the clock running.\n*In [[electric clock]]s, the power source is either a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or the [[Mains power|AC power line]]. In clocks that use AC power, a small [[backup battery]] is often included to keep the clock running if it is unplugged temporarily from the wall or during a power outage.  Battery powered analog wall clocks are available that operate over 15 years between battery changes.\n\n===Oscillator===\nThe timekeeping element in every modern clock is a [[harmonic oscillator]], a physical object ([[resonator]]) that vibrates or [[oscillate]]s repetitively at a precisely constant [[frequency]].<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\n*In mechanical clocks, this is either a [[pendulum]] or a [[balance wheel]].\n*In some early electronic clocks and watches such as the [[Accutron]], it is a [[tuning fork]].\n*In [[quartz clock]]s and watches, it is a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]].\n*In [[atomic clock]]s, it is the vibration of [[electron]]s in [[atom]]s as they emit [[microwave]]s.\n*In early mechanical clocks before 1657, it was a crude balance wheel or [[Verge escapement|foliot]] which was not a harmonic oscillator because it lacked a [[balance spring]]. As a result, they were very inaccurate, with errors of perhaps an hour a day.<ref>Milham, 1945, p.85</ref>\nThe advantage of a harmonic oscillator over other forms of oscillator is that it employs [[resonance]] to vibrate at a precise natural [[resonant frequency]] or 'beat' dependent only on its physical characteristics, and resists vibrating at other rates. The possible precision achievable by a harmonic oscillator is measured by a parameter called its [[Q factor|Q]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Quality factor, Q|work=Glossary|publisher=Time and Frequency Division, NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)|year=2008|url=http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm|accessdate=2008-06-04}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&pg=PA44&sig=iBunChocEtJoeKS5p5IgJ1oyl4U Jespersen 1999, p.47-50]</ref> or quality factor, which increases (other things being equal) with its resonant frequency.<ref>{{cite book|last=Riehle|first=Fritz|title=Frequency Standards: Basics and Applications|publisher=Wiley VCH Verlag & Co.|year=2004|location=Germany|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WZ34pQV-DXMC&pg=PA9&dq=Q+linewidth+%22split+the+line%22|isbn=3-527-40230-6}}</ref> This is why there has been a long term trend toward higher frequency oscillators in clocks. Balance wheels and pendulums always include a means of adjusting the rate of the timepiece. Quartz timepieces sometimes include a rate screw that adjusts a [[capacitor]] for that purpose. Atomic clocks are [[Standard (technical)|primary standards]], and their rate cannot be adjusted.\n\n====Synchronized or slave clocks====\nSome clocks rely for their accuracy on an external oscillator; that is, they are automatically [[Synchronization|synchronized]] to a more accurate clock:\n*[[Slave clock]]s, used in large institutions and schools from the 1860s to the 1970s, kept time with a pendulum, but were wired to a [[master clock]] in the building, and periodically received a signal to synchronize them with the master, often on the hour.<ref>Milham, 1945, p.325-328</ref> Later versions without pendulums were triggered by a pulse from the master clock and certain sequences used to force rapid synchronization following a power failure.\n*[[Electric clock|Synchronous electric clocks]] do not have an internal oscillator, but count cycles of the 50 or 60 [[Hertz|Hz]] oscillation of the [[Mains power|AC power line]], which is synchronized by the utility to a precision oscillator. The counting may be done electronically, usually in clocks with digital displays, or, in analog clocks, the AC may drive a [[synchronous motor]] which rotates an exact fraction of a revolution for every cycle of the line voltage, and drives the gear train.  Although changes in the [[Electric grid|grid]] line frequency due to load variations may cause the clock to temporarily gain or lose several seconds during the course of a day, the total number of cycles per 24 hours is maintained extremely accurately by the utility company, so that the clock keeps time accurately over long periods.\n*Computer [[real time clock]]s keep time with a quartz crystal, but can be periodically (usually weekly) synchronized over the [[Internet]] to atomic clocks ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), using the [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP). Sometimes computers on a [[local area network]] (LAN) get their time from a single local server which is maintained accurately.\n*[[Radio clock]]s keep time with a quartz crystal, but are periodically synchronized to [[radio time signal|time signals]] transmitted from dedicated [[Radio clock#List of radio time signal stations|standard time radio stations]] or [[satellite navigation]] signals, which are set by [[atomic clock]]s.\n\n===Controller===\nThis has the dual function of keeping the oscillator running by giving it 'pushes' to replace the energy lost to [[friction]], and converting its vibrations into a series of pulses that serve to measure the time.\n*In mechanical clocks, this is the [[escapement]], which gives precise pushes to the swinging pendulum or balance wheel, and releases one gear tooth of the ''escape wheel'' at each swing, allowing all the clock's wheels to move forward a fixed amount with each swing.\n*In electronic clocks this is an [[Electronic oscillator|electronic oscillator circuit]] that gives the vibrating quartz crystal or tuning fork tiny 'pushes', and generates a series of electrical pulses, one for each vibration of the crystal, which is called the [[clock signal]].\n*In [[atomic clock]]s the controller is an evacuated [[microwave]] [[Cavity resonator|cavity]] attached to a microwave [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] controlled by a [[microprocessor]]. A thin gas of [[cesium]] atoms is released into the cavity where they are exposed to [[microwaves]]. A laser measures how many atoms have absorbed the microwaves, and an electronic [[feedback]] control system called a [[phase-locked loop]] tunes the microwave oscillator until it is at the exact frequency that causes the atoms to vibrate and absorb the microwaves. Then the microwave signal is divided by [[digital counter]]s to become the [[clock signal]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&pg=PA61&sig=r7PLMbI4rhAgfGkfBS-MCJEBkVs Jespersen 1999, p.52-62]</ref>\nIn mechanical clocks, the low [[Q factor|Q]] of the balance wheel or pendulum oscillator made them very sensitive to the disturbing effect of the impulses of the escapement, so the escapement had a great effect on the accuracy of the clock, and many escapement designs were tried. The higher Q of resonators in electronic clocks makes them relatively insensitive to the disturbing effects of the drive power, so the driving oscillator circuit is a much less critical component.<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\n\n===Counter chain===\nThis counts the pulses and adds them up to get traditional time units of [[second]]s, [[minute]]s, [[hour]]s, etc. It usually has a provision for ''setting'' the clock by manually entering the correct time into the counter.\n*In mechanical clocks this is done mechanically by a [[gear train]], known as the [[wheel train (horology)|wheel train]]. The gear train also has a second function; to transmit mechanical power from the power source to run the oscillator. There is a friction coupling called the 'cannon pinion' between the gears driving the hands and the rest of the clock, allowing the hands to be turned to set the time.<ref>Milham, 1945, p.113</ref>\n*In digital clocks a series of [[integrated circuit]] [[counter (digital)|counter]]s or dividers add the pulses up [[Digital data|digital]]ly, using [[binary numeral system|binary]] logic. Often pushbuttons on the case allow the hour and minute counters to be incremented and decremented to set the time.\n\n===Indicator===\n[[File:Cuckoo strikes the 8th hour.ogv|thumb|right|A [[Cuckoo clock]] with mechanical [[automaton]] and sound producer striking on the 8th hour on the analog dial.]]\nThis displays the count of seconds, minutes, hours, etc. in a human readable form.\n*The earliest mechanical clocks in the 13th century didn't have a visual indicator and signalled the time [[wikt:audible|audibly]] by striking [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s. Many clocks to this day are [[striking clock]]s which strike the hour.\n*Analog clocks display time with an analog [[clock face]], which consists of a round dial with the numbers 1 through 12, the hours in the day, around the outside.   The hours are indicated with an [[hour hand]], which makes two revolutions in a day, while the minutes are indicated by a [[Clock face|minute hand]], which makes one revolution per hour.  In mechanical clocks a gear train drives the hands; in electronic clocks the circuit produces pulses every second which drive a [[stepper motor]] and gear train, which move the hands.\n*[[Digital clock]]s display the time in periodically changing [[numerical digit|digit]]s on a digital [[display device|display]].  A common misconception is that a digital clock is more accurate than an analog wall clock, but the indicator type is separate and apart from the accuracy of the timing source.\n*[[Talking clock]]s and the [[speaking clock]] services provided by telephone companies speak the time audibly, using either recorded or digitally [[Voice synthesis|synthesized voices]].\n\n==Types==\nClocks can be classified by the type of time display, as well as by the method of timekeeping.\n\n===Time display methods===\n\n====Analog clocks====\n{{See also|Clock face}}\n[[File:Picadillycircuslinearclock.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A linear clock at [[London]]'s [[Piccadilly Circus tube station]]. The 24 hour band moves across the static map, keeping pace with the apparent movement of the sun above ground, and a pointer fixed on London points to the current time.]]\n\nAnalog clocks usually use a [[clock face]] which indicates time using rotating pointers called \"hands\" on a fixed numbered dial or dials.  The standard clock face, known universally throughout the world,  has a short \"hour hand\" which indicates the [[hour]] on a circular dial of 12 [[hour]]s, making two revolutions per day, and a longer \"minute hand\" which indicates the minutes in the current hour on the same dial, which is also divided into 60 minutes. It may also have a \"second hand\" which indicates the [[second]]s in the current minute.    The only other widely used clock face today is the [[24 hour analog dial]],  because of the use of [[24 hour time]] in [[military]] organizations and timetables.  Before the modern clock face was standardized during the [[Industrial Revolution]], many other face designs were used throughout the years, including dials divided into 6, 8, 10, and 24 hours.  During the [[French Revolution]] the French government tried to introduce a [[10-hour clock]], as part of their the decimal-based [[metric system]] of measurement, but it didn't catch on.  An Italian 6 hour clock was developed in the 18th century, presumably to save power (a clock or watch striking 24 times uses more power).\n\nAnother type of analog clock is the [[sundial]], which tracks the sun continuously, registering the time by the shadow position of its [[gnomon]]. Because the sun does not adjust to daylight savings times, users must add an hour during that time. Corrections must also be made for the [[equation of time]], and for the difference between the longitudes of the sundial and of the central meridian of the [[time zone]] that is being used (i.e. 15 degrees east of the [[prime meridian]] for each hour that the time zone is ahead of [[GMT]]). Sundials use some or part of the 24 hour analog dial. There also exist clocks which use a digital display despite having an analog mechanism\u2014these are commonly referred to as [[flip clock]]s.\n\nAlternative systems have been proposed. For example, the \"Twelv\" clock <!-- not a typo, see http://www.gizmag.com/go/6312/ -->indicates the current hour using one of twelve colors, and indicates the minute by showing a proportion of a circular disk, similar to a [[Lunar phase|moon phase]].<ref>\u2022{{US Patent|7079452}}<br />\u2022{{US Patent|7221624}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n====Digital clocks====\n{{main article|Digital clock}}\n<gallery mode=packed heights=\"200px\" caption=\"Examples of digital clocks\">\nKanazawa Station Water Clock.jpg|Digital clock outside [[Kanazawa Station]] displaying the time by controlling valves on a fountain\nDigital-clock-radio-basic hf.jpg|Basic digital clock radio\nCyanogenMod 10 homescreen screenshot.png|[[Mobile phone]] display with an analog-style clock (albeit generated by a digital computer) in the middle, and a digital-style in the top right corner\nAnalog clock with digital display.png|Diagram of a mechanical digital display of a [[flip clock]]\n</gallery>\n\nDigital clocks display a numeric representation of time. Two numeric display formats are commonly used on [[Digital data|digital]] clocks:\n\n* the [[24-hour notation]] with hours ranging 00\u201323;\n* the [[12-hour notation]] with AM/PM indicator, with hours indicated as 12AM, followed by 1AM\u201311AM, followed by 12PM, followed by 1PM\u201311PM (a notation mostly used in domestic environments).\n\nMost digital clocks use electronic mechanisms and [[LCD]], [[LED]], or [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays; many other display technologies are used as well ([[cathode ray tube]]s, [[nixie tube]]s, etc.). After a reset, battery change or power failure, these clocks without a backup [[battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[capacitor]] either start counting from 12:00, or stay at 12:00, often with blinking digits indicating that the time needs to be set. Some newer clocks will reset themselves based on radio or Internet [[time server]]s that are tuned to national [[atomic clock]]s. Since the advent of digital clocks in the 1960s, the use of analog clocks has declined significantly.\n\nSome clocks, called '[[flip clock]]s', have digital displays that work mechanically. The digits are painted on sheets of material which are mounted like the pages of a book. Once a minute, a page is turned over to reveal the next digit. These displays are usually easier to read in brightly lit conditions than LCDs or LEDs. Also, they do not go back to 12:00 after a power interruption. Flip clocks generally do not have electronic mechanisms. Usually, they are driven by [[Alternating current|AC]]-[[synchronous motor]]s.\n\n====Auditory clocks====\n{{Main article|Talking clock}}\nFor convenience, distance, telephony or [[blindness]], auditory clocks present the time as sounds. The sound is either spoken [[natural language]], (e.g. \"The time is twelve thirty-five\"), or as auditory codes (e.g. number of sequential bell rings on the hour represents the number of the hour like the bell, [[Big Ben]]). Most telecommunication companies also provide a [[speaking clock]] service as well.\n\n====Word clocks====\n[[File:Word clock wallpaper with comic speech bubble style.png|thumb|Software word clock]]\nWord clocks are clocks that display the time visually using sentences. E.g.: \"It\u2019s about three o\u2019clock.\" These clocks can be implemented in hardware or software.\n\n====Projection clocks====\n{{Main article|Projection clock}}\nSome clocks, usually digital ones, include an optical [[Image projector|projector]] that shines a magnified image of the time display onto a screen or onto a surface such as an indoor ceiling or wall. The digits are large enough to be easily read, without using glasses, by persons with moderately imperfect vision, so the clocks are convenient for use in their bedrooms. Usually, the timekeeping circuitry has a battery as a backup source for an uninterrupted power supply to keep the clock on time, while the projection light only works when the unit is connected to an A.C. supply. Completely battery-powered portable versions resembling [[flashlight]]s are also available.\n\n====Tactile clocks====\nAuditory and projection clocks can be used by people who are blind or have limited vision. There are also clocks for the blind that have displays that can be read by using the sense of touch. Some of these are similar to normal analog displays, but are constructed so the hands can be felt without damaging them. Another type is essentially digital, and uses devices that use a code such as [[Braille]] to show the digits so that they can be felt with the fingertips.\n\n====Multi-display clocks====\nSome clocks have several displays driven by a single mechanism, and some others have several completely separate mechanisms in a single case. Clocks in public places often have several faces visible from different directions, so that the clock can be read from anywhere in the vicinity. Of course, all the faces show the same time. Other clocks show the current time in several time-zones. Watches that are intended to be carried by travellers often have two displays, one for the local time and the other for the time at home, which is useful for making pre-arranged phone calls. Some [[equation clock]]s have two displays, one showing [[Local mean time|mean time]] and the other [[Solar time#Apparent solar time|solar time]], as would be shown by a sundial. Some clocks have both analog and digital displays. Clocks with Braille displays usually also have conventional digits so they can be read by sighted people.\n\n==Purposes==\n[[File:Robbins NC Clock.jpg|thumb|right|Many cities and towns traditionally have public clocks in a prominent location, such as a [[town square]] or [[city center]].  This one is on display at the center of the town of [[Robbins, North Carolina]].]]\nClocks are in homes, offices and many other places; smaller ones ([[watch]]es) are carried on the wrist or in a pocket; larger ones are in public places, e.g. a [[railway station]] or [[Church (building)|church]]. A small clock is often shown in a corner of [[computer display]]s, [[mobile phone]]s and many [[MP3 player]]s.\n\nThe primary purpose of a clock is to ''display'' the time. Clocks may also have the facility to make a loud alert signal at a specified time, typically to waken a sleeper at a preset time; they are referred to as ''alarm clocks''. The alarm may start at a low volume and become louder, or have the facility to be switched off for a few minutes then resume. Alarm clocks with visible indicators are sometimes used to indicate to children too young to read the time that the time for sleep has finished; they are sometimes called ''training clocks''.\n\nA clock mechanism may be used to ''control'' a device according to time, e.g. a [[central heating]] system, a [[VCR]], or a [[time bomb]] (see: [[digital counter]]). Such mechanisms are usually called [[timer]]s. Clock mechanisms are also used to drive devices such as [[Solar tracker#Chronological tracker|solar trackers]] and [[Telescope mount#Equatorial mounts|astronomical telescopes]], which have to turn at accurately controlled speeds to counteract the rotation of the Earth.\n\nMost [[digital computer]]s depend on an internal signal at constant frequency to synchronize processing; this is referred to as a [[clock signal]]. (A few research projects are developing CPUs based on [[asynchronous circuit]]s.) Some equipment, including computers, also maintains time and date for use as required; this is referred to as time-of-day clock, and is distinct from the system clock signal, although possibly based on counting its cycles.\n\n===Time standards===\n{{Main article|Time standard|Atomic clock}}\nFor some scientific work timing of the utmost accuracy is essential. It is also necessary to have a standard of the maximum accuracy against which working clocks can be calibrated. An ideal clock would give the time to unlimited accuracy, but this is of course not realisable.\n\nMany physical processes, in particular including some [[Electronic transition|transitions]] between atomic [[energy level]]s, occur at exceedingly stable frequency; counting cycles of such a process can give a very accurate and consistent time\u2014clocks which work this way are usually called [[atomic clock]]s. Such clocks are typically large, very expensive, require a controlled environment, and are far more accurate than required for most purposes; they are typically used in a [[Metrology#Laboratories|standards laboratory]].\n\n===Navigation===\nUntil advances in the late twentieth century, [[navigation]] depended on the ability to measure [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. Latitude can be determined through [[celestial navigation]]; the measurement of [[longitude]] requires accurate knowledge of time. This need was a major motivation for the development of accurate mechanical clocks. [[John Harrison]] created the first highly accurate [[marine chronometer]] in the mid-18th century. The [[Noon gun]] in [[Cape Town]] still fires an accurate signal to allow ships to check their [[marine chronometer|chronometers]]. Many buildings near major ports used to have (some still do) a large [[Time ball|ball]] mounted on a tower or mast arranged to drop at a pre-determined time, for the same purpose.\n\nWhile [[satellite navigation]] systems such as the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) require unprecedentedly accurate knowledge of time, this is supplied by equipment on the satellites; vehicles no longer need timekeeping equipment.\n\n===Seismology===\nIn determining the location of an [[earthquake]], the arrival time of several types of [[seismic wave]] at a minimum of four dispersed observers is dependent upon each observer recording wave [[arrival time]]s according to a common clock.\n\n==Specific types of clocks==\n[[File:Clock sculpture - Drexel University - IMG 7332.JPG|thumb|A monumental conical pendulum clock by [[Eug\u00e8ne Farcot]], 1867.
