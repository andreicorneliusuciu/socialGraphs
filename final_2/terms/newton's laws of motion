[[Leonhard Euler]] in 1750 introduced a generalisation of Newton's laws of motion for rigid bodies called [[Euler's laws of motion]], later applied as well for deformable bodies assumed as a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]]. If a body is represented as an assemblage of discrete particles, each governed by Newton's laws of motion, then Euler's laws can be derived from Newton's laws.

Velocity is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity which expresses both the object's [[speed]] and the direction of its motion; therefore, the statement that the object's velocity is constant is a statement that both its speed and the direction of its motion are constant.\n\nThe first law can be stated mathematically when the mass is a non-zero constant, as,\n:<math>\n\\sum \\mathbf{F} = 0\\; \\Leftrightarrow\\; \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{v} }{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0.\n</math>\nConsequently,\n* An object that is at rest will stay at rest unless a force acts upon it.\n* An object that is in motion will not change its velocity unless a force acts upon it.\n\nThis is known as ''uniform motion''. An object ''continues'' to do whatever it happens to be doing unless a force is exerted upon it. If it is at rest, it continues in a state of rest (demonstrated when a tablecloth is skilfully whipped from under dishes on a tabletop and the dishes remain in their initial state of rest). If an object is moving, it continues to move without turning or changing its speed. This is evident in space probes that continually move in outer space. Changes in motion must be imposed against the tendency of an object to retain its state of motion. In the absence of net forces, a moving object tends to move along a straight line path indefinitely.\n\nNewton placed the first law of motion to establish [[frames of reference]] for which the other laws are applicable. The first law of motion postulates the existence of at least one [[frame of reference]] called a Newtonian or [[inertial reference frame]], relative to which the motion of a particle not subject to forces is a straight line at a constant speed.<ref name=tseitlin/><ref name=Woodhouse>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ggPXQAeeRLgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn=1852334266#PPA6,M1 |title=Special relativity |page=6 |author=NMJ Woodhouse |publisher=Springer |date=2003 |isbn=1-85233-426-6 |location=London/Berlin}}</ref> Newton's first law is often referred to as the ''[[Inertia|law of inertia]]''.

The relationship also implies the [[conservation of momentum]]: when the net force on the body is zero, the momentum of the body is constant. Any net force is equal to the rate of change of the momentum.\n\nAny mass that is gained or lost by the system will cause a change in momentum that is not the result of an external force. A different equation is necessary for variable-mass systems (see [[#Variable-mass_systems|below]]).\n\nNewton's second law requires modification if the effects of [[special relativity]] are to be taken into account, because at high speeds the approximation that momentum is the product of rest mass and velocity is not accurate.\n\n===Impulse===\nAn [[Impulse (physics)|impulse]] '''J''' occurs when a force '''F''' acts over an interval of time \u0394''t'', and it is given by<ref>Hannah, J, Hillier, M J, ''Applied Mechanics'', p221, Pitman Paperbacks, 1971</ref><ref name=Serway>{{cite book |title=College Physics |page=161 |author=Raymond A.

In some situations, the magnitude and direction of the forces are determined entirely by one of the two bodies, say Body A; the force exerted by Body A on Body B is called the \"action\", and the force exerted by Body B on Body A is called the \"reaction\". This law is sometimes referred to as the ''[[Reaction (physics)|action-reaction law]]'', with '''F'''<sub>''A''</sub> called the \"action\" and '''F'''<sub>''B''</sub> the \"reaction\". In other situations the magnitude and directions of the forces are determined jointly by both bodies and it isn't necessary to identify one force as the \"action\" and the other as the \"reaction\". The action and the reaction are simultaneous, and it does not matter which is called the ''action'' and which is called ''reaction''; both forces are part of a single interaction, and neither force exists without the other.<ref name=\"resnick83\" />\n\nThe two forces in Newton's third law are of the same type (e.g., if the road exerts a forward frictional force on an accelerating car's tires, then it is also a frictional force that Newton's third law predicts for the tires pushing backward on the road).\n\nFrom a conceptual standpoint, Newton's third law is seen when a person walks: they push against the floor, and the floor pushes against the person. Similarly, the tires of a car push against the road while the road pushes back on the tires\u2014the tires and road simultaneously push against each other. In swimming, a person interacts with the water, pushing the water backward, while the water simultaneously pushes the person forward\u2014both the person and the water push against each other. The reaction forces account for the motion in these examples. These forces depend on friction; a person or car on ice, for example, may be unable to exert the action force to produce the needed reaction force.<ref>Hewitt (2006), p. 75</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Newton's 1st Law===\nFrom the original [[Latin]] of Newton's ''Principia'':\n{{Cquote|''Lex I: Corpus omne perseverare in statu suo quiescendi vel movendi uniformiter in directum, nisi quatenus a viribus impressis cogitur statum illum mutare.''}}\n\nTranslated to English, this reads:\n{{Cquote|Law I: Every body persists in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by force impressed.<ref>Isaac Newton, ''The Principia'', A new translation by I.B. Cohen and A. Whitman, University of California press, Berkeley 1999.</ref>}}\n\nThe ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] had the view that all objects have a natural place in the universe: that heavy objects (such as rocks) wanted to be at rest on the Earth and that light objects like smoke wanted to be at rest in the sky and the stars wanted to remain in the heavens. He thought that a body was in its natural state when it was at rest, and for the body to move in a straight line at a constant speed an external agent was needed continually to propel it, otherwise it would stop moving. [[Galileo Galilei]], however, realised that a force is necessary to change the velocity of a body, i.e., acceleration, but no force is needed to maintain its velocity. In other words, Galileo stated that, in the ''absence'' of a force, a moving object will continue moving. (The tendency of objects to resist changes in motion was what [[Johannes Kepler]] had called ''inertia''.) This insight was refined by Newton, who made it into his first law, also known as the \"law of inertia\"\u2014no force means no acceleration, and hence the body will maintain its velocity. As Newton's first law is a restatement of the law of inertia which Galileo had already described, Newton appropriately gave credit to Galileo.\n\nThe law of inertia apparently occurred to several different natural philosophers and scientists independently, including [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his ''[[Leviathan (book)|Leviathan]]''.<ref>Thomas Hobbes wrote in ''[[Leviathan (book)|Leviathan]]'': {{quote|That when a thing lies still, unless somewhat else stir it, it will lie still forever, is a truth that no man doubts. But [the proposition] that when a thing is in motion it will eternally be in motion unless somewhat else stay it, though the reason be the same (namely that nothing can change itself), is not so easily assented to. For men measure not only other men but all other things by themselves. And because they find themselves subject after motion to pain and lassitude, [they] think every thing else grows weary of motion and seeks repose of its own accord, little considering whether it be not some other motion wherein that desire of rest they find in themselves, consists.}}</ref> The 17th century philosopher and mathematician [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] also formulated the law, although he did not perform any experiments to confirm it.<ref name=\"cohen117\">{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=I.

See Harman and Shapiro, cited below.</ref> this is understood, in modern terms, as an equivalent of:\n''{{quote|The change of momentum of a body is proportional to the impulse impressed on the body, and happens along the straight line on which that impulse is impressed.}}''\nThis may be expressed by the formula F = p', where p' is the time derivative of the momentum p. This equation can be seen clearly in the [[Wren Library]] of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], in a glass case in which Newton's manuscript is open to the relevant page.\n\nMotte's 1729 translation of Newton's Latin continued with Newton's commentary on the second law of motion, reading:\n''{{quote|If a force generates a motion, a double force will generate double the motion, a triple force triple the motion, whether that force be impressed altogether and at once, or gradually and successively. And this motion (being always directed the same way with the generating force), if the body moved before, is added to or subtracted from the former motion, according as they directly conspire with or are directly contrary to each other; or obliquely joined, when they are oblique, so as to produce a new motion compounded from the determination of both.}}''\n\nThe sense or senses in which Newton used his terminology, and how he understood the second law and intended it to be understood, have been extensively discussed by historians of science, along with the relations between Newton's formulation and modern formulations.<ref>See for example (1) I Bernard Cohen, \"Newton's Second Law and the Concept of Force in the Principia\", in \"The Annus Mirabilis of Sir Isaac Newton 1666\u20131966\" (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 1967), pages 143\u2013185; (2) Stuart Pierson, \"'Corpore cadente. . .': Historians Discuss Newton\u2019s Second Law\", Perspectives on Science, 1 (1993), pages 627\u2013658; and (3) Bruce Pourciau, \"Newton's Interpretation of Newton's Second Law\", Archive for History of Exact Sciences, vol.60 (2006), pages 157\u2013207; also an online discussion by G E Smith, in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/newton-principia/index.html#NewLawMot 5.

If you press a stone with your finger, the finger is also pressed by the stone. If a horse draws a stone tied to a rope, the horse (if I may so say) will be equally drawn back towards the stone: for the distended rope, by the same endeavour to relax or unbend itself, will draw the horse as much towards the stone, as it does the stone towards the horse, and will obstruct the progress of the one as much as it advances that of the other. If a body impinges upon another, and by its force changes the motion of the other, that body also (because of the equality of the mutual pressure) will undergo an equal change, in its own motion, toward the contrary part. The changes made by these actions are equal, not in the velocities but in the motions of the bodies; that is to say, if the bodies are not hindered by any other impediments. For, as the motions are equally changed, the changes of the velocities made toward contrary parts are reciprocally proportional to the bodies. This law takes place also in attractions, as will be proved in the next scholium.<ref>This translation of the third law and the commentary following it can be found in the \"[[Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy|Principia]]\" on [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA20#v=onepage&q=&f=false page 20 of volume 1 of the 1729 translation].</ref>}}\n\nIn the above, as usual, ''motion'' is Newton's name for momentum, hence his careful distinction between motion and velocity.\n\nNewton used the third law to derive the law of [[momentum#Conservation|conservation of momentum]];<ref>Newton, ''Principia'', Corollary III to the laws of motion</ref> from a deeper perspective, however, conservation of momentum is the more fundamental idea (derived via [[Noether's theorem]] from [[Galilean invariance]]), and holds in cases where Newton's third law appears to fail, for instance when [[force field (physics)|force fields]] as well as particles carry momentum, and in [[quantum mechanics]]. <!-- In force fields I do not think the violation is a necessity; we could easily remodel the fields perhaps as interaction between particles at the quantum level and still have the 3rd law holding. I think the 3rd law breakdown is just a consequence of the model used -->\n\n==Importance and range of validity==\nNewton's laws were verified by experiment and observation for over 200 years, and they are excellent approximations at the scales and speeds of everyday life. Newton's laws of motion, together with his law of [[universal gravitation]] and the mathematical techniques of [[calculus]], provided for the first time a unified quantitative explanation for a wide range of physical phenomena.\n\nThese three laws hold to a good approximation for macroscopic objects under everyday conditions. However, Newton's laws (combined with universal gravitation and [[classical electrodynamics]]) are inappropriate for use in certain circumstances, most notably at very small scales, very high speeds (in [[special relativity]], the [[Lorentz factor]] must be included in the expression for momentum along with the [[rest mass]] and velocity) or very strong gravitational fields. Therefore, the laws cannot be used to explain phenomena such as conduction of electricity in a [[semiconductor]], optical properties of substances, errors in non-relativistically corrected [[GPS]] systems and [[superconductivity]]. Explanation of these phenomena requires more sophisticated physical theories, including [[general relativity]] and [[quantum field theory]].\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], concepts such as force, momentum, and position are defined by linear [[Operator (physics)|operators]] that operate on the [[quantum state]]; at speeds that are much lower than the speed of light, Newton's laws are just as exact for these operators as they are for classical objects. At speeds comparable to the speed of light, the second law holds in the original form '''F'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;d'''p'''/d''t'', where '''F''' and '''p''' are [[four-vector]]s.\n\n==Relationship to the conservation laws==\nIn modern physics, the [[Conservation law (physics)|laws of conservation]] of [[momentum]], energy, and [[angular momentum]] are of more general validity than Newton's laws, since they apply to both light and matter, and to both classical and non-classical physics.\n\nThis can be stated simply, \"Momentum, energy and angular momentum cannot be created or destroyed.\"\n\nBecause force is the time derivative of momentum, the concept of force is redundant and subordinate to the conservation of momentum, and is not used in fundamental theories (e.g., [[quantum mechanics]], [[quantum electrodynamics]], [[general relativity]], etc.). The [[standard model]] explains in detail how the three fundamental forces known as [[Gauge theory|gauge forces]] originate out of exchange by [[virtual particles]]. Other forces, such as [[Gravitation|gravity]] and [[Pauli exclusion principle#Consequences|fermionic degeneracy pressure]], also arise from the momentum conservation. Indeed, the conservation of [[4-momentum]] in inertial motion via [[curved space-time]] results in what we call [[gravitational force]] in [[general relativity]] theory. The application of the space derivative (which is a [[momentum operator]] in quantum mechanics) to the overlapping [[wave functions]] of a pair of [[fermion]]s (particles with half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]]) results in shifts of maxima of compound wavefunction away from each other, which is observable as the \"repulsion\" of the fermions.\n\nNewton stated the third law within a world-view that assumed instantaneous action at a distance between material particles. However, he was prepared for philosophical criticism of this [[Action at a distance (physics)|action at a distance]], and it was in this context that he stated the famous phrase \"[[Hypotheses non fingo|I feign no hypotheses]]\". In modern physics, action at a distance has been completely eliminated, except for subtle effects involving [[quantum entanglement]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} However, in modern engineering, in all practical applications involving the motion of vehicles and satellites, the concept of action at a distance is used extensively.\n\nThe discovery of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] by [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Carnot]] in the 19th century showed that every physical quantity is not conserved over time, thus disproving the validity of inducing the opposite metaphysical view from Newton's laws. Hence, a \"steady-state\" worldview based solely on Newton's laws and the conservation laws does not take [[entropy]] into account.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Isaac Newton}}\n{{Commons category|Newton&#39;s laws of motion}}\n* [[Euler's laws]]\n* [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]\n* [[Lagrangian mechanics]]\n* [[List of scientific laws named after people]]\n* [[Mercury (planet)#Orbit, rotation, and longitude|Mercury, orbit of]]\n* [[Modified Newtonian dynamics]]\n* [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]]\n* [[Principle of least action]]\n* [[Reaction (physics)]]\n* [[Principle of relativity]]\n\n==References and notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading and works cited==\n*<cite id=cro2000>Crowell, Benjamin (2011), [http://www.lightandmatter.com/lm/ ''Light and Matter''] (2011, Light and Matter), especially at Section [http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/lm/ch04/ch04.html#Section4.2 ''4.2, Newton's First Law''], Section [http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/lm/ch04/ch04.html#Section4.3 ''4.3, Newton's Second Law''], and Section [http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/lm/ch05/ch05.html#Section5.1 ''5.1, Newton's Third Law''].</cite>\n*{{cite book|last1=Feynman|first1=R.
