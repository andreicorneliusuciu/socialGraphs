Equipment and conductors that carry high voltage warrant particular safety requirements and procedures. In certain industries, ''high voltage'' means voltage above a particular threshold ''(see below)''. High voltage is used in [[electrical power distribution]], in [[cathode ray tube]]s, to generate [[X-rays]] and [[particle beam]]s, to demonstrate [[arcing]], for ignition, in [[photomultiplier| photomultiplier tubes]], and in high power [[amplifier]] [[vacuum tube]]s and other industrial and scientific applications.\n\n== Definition ==\n{{IEC voltage ranges}}\nThe numerical definition of 'high voltage' depends on context. Two factors considered in classifying a voltage as \"high voltage\" are the possibility of causing a spark in air, and the danger of electric shock by contact or proximity. The definitions may refer to the voltage between two conductors of a system, or between any conductor and [[Ground (electricity)|ground]].\n\nIn [[electric power transmission]] engineering, high voltage is usually considered any voltage over approximately 35,000 volts. This is a classification based on the design of apparatus and insulation.\n\nThe [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] and its national counterparts ([[Institution of Engineering and Technology|IET]], [[IEEE]], [[Verband der Elektrotechnik, Elektronik und Informationstechnik|VDE]], etc.) define ''high voltage'' as above 1000&nbsp;[[volt|V]] for [[alternating current]], and at least 1500 V for [[direct current]]\u2014and distinguish it from [[low voltage]] (50\u20131000 V AC or 120\u20131500&nbsp;V DC) and [[extra-low voltage]] (&lt;50&nbsp;V AC or &lt;120&nbsp;V DC) circuits. This is in the context of building wiring and the safety of electrical apparatus.\n\nIn the [[United States]] 2011 [[National Electrical Code]] (NEC) is the standard regulating most electrical installations. There are no definitions relating to ''high voltage''. The NEC\u00ae covers voltages 600 volts and less and that over 600 volts. The National Electrical Manufacturer's Association (NEMA) defines high voltage as over 100kV to 230kV. British Standard [[BS 7671]]:2008 defines ''high voltage'' as any voltage difference between conductors that is higher than 1000 V AC or 1500 V ripple-free DC, or any voltage difference between a conductor and Earth that is higher than 600&nbsp;V AC or 900&nbsp;V ripple-free DC.\n\n[[Electrician]]s may only be licensed for particular voltage classes, in some jurisdictions.<ref>One such jurisdiction is [[Manitoba]], where  the ''Electrician's Licence Act, CCSM E50'' establishes classes of electrician's licences by voltage.</ref>  For example, an electrical license for a specialized sub-trade such as installation of [[HVAC]] systems, [[fire alarm]] systems, [[closed circuit television]] systems may be authorized to install systems energized up to only 30 volts between conductors, and may not be permitted to work on mains-voltage circuits. The general public may consider household [[mains electricity|mains]] circuits (100\u2013250&nbsp;V AC), which carry the highest voltages they normally encounter, to be ''high voltage''.\n\nVoltages over approximately 50 volts can usually cause dangerous amounts of current to flow through a human being who touches two points of a circuit\u2014so safety standards, in general, are more restrictive around such circuits..{{Citation needed|reason=Need reference for the 50V value.|date=September 2013}} The definition of ''extra high voltage'' (EHV) again depends on context. In electric power transmission engineering, EHV equipment carries more than 345,000 volts between conductors. In electronics systems, a power supply that provides greater than 275,000 volts is called an ''EHV Power Supply'', and is often used in experiments in physics.\n\nThe accelerating voltage for a television cathode ray tube may be described as ''extra-high voltage'' or ''extra-high tension'' (EHT), compared to other voltage supplies within the equipment. This type of supply ranges from &gt;5&nbsp;kV to about 50&nbsp;kV.{{Citation needed|reason=Need reference for the 50kV value.|date=April 2009}}\n\nIn [[automotive engineering]], high voltage is defined as voltage in range 30\u20131000 V<sub>ac</sub> or 60\u20131500 V<sub>dc</sub>.<ref>UNECE regulation No 100 (revision 2, 12 August 2013), paragraph 2.17 http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs/2013/R100r2e.pdf</ref>\n\nIn [[digital electronics]], a high voltage usually refers to that representing a logic 1 in positive logic and a logic 0 in negative logic. It is not used to indicate a hazardous voltage and levels between ICs to TTL/CMOS standards and their modern derivatives are well below hazardous levels. The highest in mainstream use were 15V for original [[CMOS#Logic|CMOS]] and 5V for [[Transistor\u2013transistor logic|TTL]] but modern devices use 3.3V, with 1.8V or lower used in many applications.\n\n== Safety ==\n[[File:High voltage warning.svg|thumb|International [[safety symbol]] \"Caution, risk of electric shock\" ([[ISO 3864]]), also known as ''high voltage symbol'']]\nVoltages greater than 50&nbsp;V applied across dry unbroken human skin can cause heart [[fibrillation]] if they produce [[electric current]]s in body tissues that happen to pass through the [[chest]] area.{{Citation needed|reason=The 50-volt value provided here should be referenced to an outside source.|date=March 2009}}  The voltage at which there is the danger of [[electric shock|electrocution]] depends on the [[electrical conductivity]] of dry human skin. Living human tissue can be protected from damage by the insulating characteristics of dry skin up to around 50 volts. If the same skin becomes wet, if there are wounds, or if the voltage is applied to [[electrode]]s that penetrate the skin, then even voltage sources below 40&nbsp;V can be lethal.\n\nAccidental contact with high voltage supplying sufficient energy may result in severe injury or death. This can occur as a person's body provides a path for current flow, causing tissue damage and heart failure. Other injuries can include burns from the arc generated by the accidental contact. These burns can be especially dangerous if the victim's airways are affected. Injuries may also be suffered as a result of the physical forces experienced by people who fall from a great height or are thrown a considerable distance.\n\nLow-energy exposure to high voltage may be harmless, such as the spark produced in a dry climate when touching a doorknob after walking across a carpeted floor. The [[volt]]age can be in the thousand-volt range, but the [[ampere|current]] (the rate of charge transfer) is low.\n\nSafety equipment used by electrical workers includes insulated rubber gloves and mats. These protect the user from electric shock. Safety equipment is tested regularly to ensure it is still protecting the user. Test regulations vary according to country. Testing companies can test at up 300,000 volts and offer services from glove testing to Elevated Working Platform (or EWP) Truck testing.\n\n== Sparks in air ==\n[[File:electrostatic-discharge.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Long exposure photograph of a [[Tesla coil]] showing the repeated [[electric discharge]]s]]\n\nThe [[dielectric breakdown]] strength of dry air, at [[Standard Temperature and Pressure]] (STP), between spherical electrodes is approximately 33&nbsp;kV/cm.<ref>A. H. Howatson, \"An Introduction to Gas Discharges\", Pergamom Press, Oxford, 1965, page 67</ref> This is only as a rough guide, since the actual breakdown voltage is highly dependent upon the electrode shape and size. Strong [[electric field]]s (from high voltages applied to small or pointed conductors) often produce violet-colored [[corona discharge]]s in air, as well as visible sparks. Voltages below about 500\u2013700 volts cannot produce easily visible [[Electric spark|sparks]] or glows in air at atmospheric pressure, so by this rule these voltages are \"low\".  However, under conditions of low atmospheric pressure (such as in high-altitude [[aircraft]]), or in an environment of [[noble gas]] such as [[argon]] or [[neon]], sparks appear at much lower voltages. 500 to 700 volts is not a fixed minimum for producing spark breakdown, but it is a rule-of-thumb. For air at STP, the minimum sparkover voltage is around 327 volts, as noted by [[Friedrich Paschen]].<ref>{{cite journal \n | title = Ueber die zum Funken\u00fcbergang in Luft, Wasserstoff und Kohlens\u00e4ure bei verschiedenen Drucken erforderliche Potentialdifferenz\n | author = Friedrich Paschen\n | journal = Annalen der Physik\n | volume = 273\n | issue = 5\n | pages = 69\u201375\n | year = 1889\n | url = \n | doi = 10.1002/andp.18892730505|bibcode = 1889AnP...273...69P }}</ref>\n\nWhile lower voltages do not, in general, jump a gap that is present before the voltage is applied, interrupting an existing current flow with a gap often produces a low-voltage spark or [[electric arc|arc]]. As the contacts are separated, a few small points of contact become the last to separate. The current becomes constricted to these small ''hot spots'', causing them to become incandescent, so that they emit electrons (through [[thermionic emission]]). Even a small [[9 V battery]] can spark noticeably by this mechanism in a darkened room. The ionized air and metal vapour (from the contacts) form plasma, which temporarily bridges the widening gap. If the power supply and load allow sufficient current to flow, a self-sustaining [[electric arc|arc]] may form. Once formed, an arc may be extended to a significant length before breaking the circuit. Attempting to open an inductive circuit often forms an arc, since the [[inductance]] provides a high-voltage pulse whenever the current is interrupted. [[Alternating Current|AC]] systems make sustained arcing somewhat less likely, since the current returns to zero twice per cycle. The arc is extinguished every time the current goes through a [[zero crossing]], and must reignite during the next half-cycle to maintain the arc.\n\nUnlike an ohmic conductor, the resistance of an arc decreases as the current increases.  This makes unintentional arcs in an electrical apparatus dangerous since even a small arc can grow large enough to damage equipment and start fires if sufficient current is available. Intentionally produced arcs, such as used in lighting or [[welding]], require some element in the circuit to stabilize the arc's current/voltage characteristics.\n\n== Electrostatic devices, natural static electricity and similar phenomena ==\nA high voltage is not necessarily dangerous if it cannot deliver substantial [[electrical current|current]]. The common [[electrostatics|static electric sparks]] seen under low-humidity conditions always involve voltage well above 700&nbsp;V.  For example, sparks to car doors in winter can involve voltages as high as 20,000&nbsp;V.<ref>[http://www.jci.co.uk/Carseats2.html John Chubb, \"Control of body voltage getting out of a car,\" IOP Annual Congress, Brighton, 1998 ]</ref>   Also, physics demonstration devices such as [[Van de Graaff generator]]s and [[Wimshurst machine]]s can produce voltages approaching one million volts, yet at worst they deliver a brief sting. That is because the number of electrons involved is not high. These devices have a limited amount of stored energy, so the average current produced is low and usually for a short time, with impulses peaking in the amp range for a nanosecond.<ref>[http://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4368466/Understanding-and-comparing-the-differences-in-ESD-testing EDN - Understanding and comparing the differences in ESD testing</ref><ref>[http://www.amasci.com/emotor/vdgdesc.html Van de Graaff Generators Frequently Asked Questions - 1998 William J. Beaty]</ref> During the discharge, these machines apply high voltage to the body for only a millionth of a second or less. So a low-amperage current is applied for a very short time, and the number of electrons involved is very small.\n\nThe discharge may involve extremely high voltage over very short periods, but, to produce heart fibrillation, an electric [[power supply]] must produce a significant current (amperage) in the heart muscle continuing for many [[millisecond]]s, and must deposit a total energy in the range of at least millijoules or higher. A current of relatively high amperage at anything more than about fifty volts can therefore be medically significant and potentially fatal.\n\n[[Tesla coil]]s are not electrostatic machines and can produce significant currents for a sustained interval. Although their appearance in operation is similar to high voltage static electricity devices, the current supplied to a human body will be relatively constant as long as contact is maintained, and the voltage will be much higher than the break-down voltage of human skin. Used correctly, the output of a Tesla coil of proper design can have useful therapeutic effects.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source|date=February 2014}} Used incorrectly, the output can be dangerous or even fatal.\n\n== Power lines ==\n[[File:HydroOnePowerTower2.jpg|right|thumb|Power lines with high voltage warning sign.]]\nElectrical transmission and distribution lines for [[electric power]] always use voltages significantly higher than 50 volts, so contact with or close approach to the line conductors presents a danger of [[electric shock|electrocution]]. Contact with [[overhead wires]] is a frequent cause of injury or death.  Metal ladders, farm equipment, boat masts, construction machinery, aerial [[antennas]], and similar objects are frequently involved in fatal contact with overhead wires. Digging into a buried cable can also be dangerous to workers at an excavation site. Digging equipment (either hand tools or machine driven) that contacts a buried cable may energize piping or the ground in the area, resulting in electrocution of nearby workers. A [[Fault (power engineering)|fault]] in a high-voltage transmission line or substation may result in high currents flowing along the surface of the earth, producing an [[earth potential rise]] that also presents a danger of electric shock.\n\nUnauthorized persons climbing on power pylons or electrical apparatus are also frequently the victims of electrocution.<ref name=\"NIOSH\">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health - Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation:\n[http://www2a.cdc.gov/NIOSH-FACE/state.asp?state=ALL&Incident_Year=ALL&Category2=0006&Submit=Submit Cases of high-voltage related casualties]. Retrieved on November 24, 2008.</ref> At very high transmission voltages even a close approach can be hazardous, since the high voltage may arc across a significant air gap.\n\nFor high-voltage and extra-high-voltage transmission lines, specially trained personnel use \"[[live-line working|live line]]\" techniques to allow hands-on contact with energized equipment. In this case the worker is electrically connected to the [[high-voltage line]] but thoroughly insulated from the earth so that he is at the same electrical potential as that of the line. Since training for such operations is lengthy, and still presents a danger to personnel, only very important transmission lines are subject to maintenance while live.  Outside these properly engineered situations, insulation from earth does not guarantee that no current flows to earth\u2014as grounding or arcing to ground can occur in unexpected ways, and high-frequency currents can burn even an ungrounded person. Touching a transmitting [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] is dangerous for this reason, and a high-frequency [[Tesla coil]] can sustain a spark with only one endpoint.\n\nProtective equipment on high-voltage transmission lines normally prevents formation of an unwanted arc, or ensures that it is quenched within tens of milliseconds.  Electrical apparatus that interrupts high-voltage circuits is designed to safely direct the resulting arc so that it dissipates without damage. High voltage [[circuit breakers]] often use a blast of high pressure air, a special [[dielectric gas]] (such as [[SF6|SF<sub>6</sub>]] under pressure), or immersion in [[mineral oil]] to quench the arc when the high voltage circuit is broken.\n\n== Arc flash hazard ==\n{{main|Arc flash}}\n[[File:High voltage testing arrangement with large capacitors and test transformer.jpg|thumb|\nHigh voltage testing arrangement with large capacitor and test transformer\n]]\nDepending on the [[prospective short circuit current]] available at a [[switchgear]] line-up, a hazard is presented to maintenance and operating personnel due to the possibility of a high-intensity [[electric arc]].  Maximum temperature of an arc can exceed 10,000 [[kelvin]], and the radiant heat, expanding hot air, and explosive vaporization of metal and insulation material can cause severe injury to unprotected workers. Such switchgear line-ups and high-energy arc sources are commonly present in electric power utility substations and generating stations, industrial plants and large commercial buildings. In the [[United States]], the [[National Fire Protection Association]], has published a guideline standard [[NFPA 70E]] for evaluating and calculating ''arc flash hazard'', and provides standards for the protective clothing required for electrical workers exposed to such hazards in the workplace.\n\n== Explosion hazard ==\n{{main|Electrical equipment in hazardous areas}}\nEven voltages insufficient to break down air can be associated with enough energy to ignite atmospheres containing flammable gases or vapours, or suspended dust.  For example, [[hydrogen]] gas, [[natural gas]], or petrol/[[gasoline]] vapor mixed with air can be ignited by sparks produced by electrical apparatus.  Examples of industrial facilities with hazardous areas are [[petrochemical]] refineries, [[chemical plant]]s, [[grain elevator]]s, and [[coal mine]]s.\n\nMeasures taken to prevent such explosions include:\n* [[Intrinsic safety]] by the use of apparatus designed not to accumulate enough stored electrical energy to trigger an explosion\n* Increased safety, which applies to devices using measures such as oil-filled enclosures to prevent sparks\n* Explosion-proof (flame-proof) enclosures, which are designed so that an explosion within the enclosure cannot escape and ignite a surrounding explosive atmosphere (this designation does not imply that the apparatus can survive an internal or external explosion)\n\nIn recent years, standards for explosion hazard protection have become more uniform between European and North American practice.  The \"zone\" system of classification is now used in modified form in [[United States|U.S.]] [[National Electrical Code (US)|National Electrical Code]] and in the [[Canadian Electrical Code]]. Intrinsic safety apparatus is now approved for use in North American applications.\n\n== Toxic gases ==\nElectrical discharges, including partial discharge and [[Corona discharge|corona]], can produce small quantities of toxic gases, which in a confined space can be a serious health hazard.  These gases include [[ozone]] and various [[Nitrogen oxide|oxides of nitrogen]].\n\n== Lightning ==\nThe largest-scale sparks are those produced naturally by [[lightning]].  An average bolt of negative lightning carries a current of 30 to 50 kiloamperes, transfers a charge of 5 [[coulomb]]s, and dissipates 500 [[Joule#SI multiples|megajoule]]s of energy (120&nbsp;kg [[TNT equivalent]], or enough to light a 100-watt light bulb for approximately 2 months). However, an average bolt of positive lightning (from the top of a thunderstorm) may carry a current of 300 to 500 kiloamperes, transfer a charge of up to 300 coulombs, have a potential difference up to 1 gigavolt (a billion volts), and may dissipate 300&nbsp;GJ of energy (72 tons TNT, or enough energy to light a 100-watt light bulb for up to 95 years). A negative lightning strike typically lasts for only tens of microseconds, but multiple strikes are common. A positive lightning stroke is typically a single event. However, the larger peak current may flow for hundreds of milliseconds, making it considerably hotter and more dangerous than negative lightning.\n\nHazards due to lightning obviously include a direct strike on persons or property. However, lightning can also create dangerous voltage gradients in the earth, as well as an [[electromagnetic pulse]], and can charge extended metal objects such as [[telephone]] cables, fences, and pipelines to dangerous voltages that can be carried many miles from the site of the strike. Although many of these objects are not normally conductive, very high voltage can cause the [[electrical breakdown]] of such insulators, causing them to act as conductors. These transferred potentials are dangerous to people, livestock, and electronic apparatus. Lightning strikes also start fires and explosions, which result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage. For example, each year in North America, thousands of [[forest fire]]s are started by lightning strikes.\n\nMeasures to control lightning can mitigate the hazard; these include [[lightning rod]]s, shielding wires, and bonding of electrical and structural parts of buildings to form a continuous enclosure.\n\nHigh-voltage lightning discharges in the atmosphere of [[Jupiter]] are thought to be the source of the planet's powerful [[radio]] frequency emissions.<ref>K.

Res., 103(E10)</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Energy}}\n* [[Capacitor voltage transformer]]\n* [[Charging station]]\n* [[Electrical engineering]]\n* [[Electric power transmission]] (includes a 'Health concerns' section)\n* [[High-voltage direct current]]\n* [[Low voltage]]\n* [[Tesla coil]]\n* [[Spark gap]]\n* [[25 kV AC]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.nfpa.org/catalog/ ''NFPA 70E'': Electrical Safety in the Workplace, USA]\n* [http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/09/f2/DOE-HDBK-1092-2013.pdf USA Department of Energy ''electrical safety handbook'']\n* [http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/DC/DC_3.html ''Electrical Safety''] chapter from [http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/DC/index.html ''Lessons In Electric Circuits Vol 1 DC''] book and [http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/ series].\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:High Voltage}}\n[[Category:Electricity]]\n[[Category:Electrical engineering]]\n[[Category:Electrical safety]]\n[[Category:Hazards]]"}]}}}}
