The first horse-drawn omnibus service was started by a businessman named Stanislas Baudry in the French city of [[Nantes]] in 1823.  The first vehicles stopped in front of the shop of a hatter named Omn\u00e9s, which had a large sign reading  \"Omnes Omnibus\", a pun on the Latin-sounding name of that hatter;  ''omnes'' means \"all\" and ''omnibus'' means (among other things) \"for all\" in [[Latin]]. Nantes citizens soon gave the nickname omnibus to the vehicle.  The omnibus in Nantes was a success and Baudry moved to Paris and launched  the first omnibus service there in April, 1828.  A similar service was introduced in London in 1829. {{Sfn|Fierro|1996|[page=1031}} <ref>{{cite web|title=Omnibus (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=omnibus&allowed_in_frame=0|publisher= Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=30 March 2013}}</ref>  <ref name=\"amtuir\">{{cite web |url=http://www.amtuir.org/03_htu_generale/htu_1_avant_1870/htu_1.htm |title=Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des transports |publisher=French transportations Museum Website  |accessdate=16 September 2010|language=fr}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n<!--\nThat are horse coaches and not a bus \n===Early history===\nA short-lived early [[Public transport bus service|public bus line]] (known as a \"carriage\" at that time) was launched by [[Blaise Pascal]] in [[Paris]] in 1662; it was quite popular until fares were increased and access to the service was restricted to high-society members by regulation and law.

As the keeper of a toll gate in [[Pendleton, Greater Manchester|Pendleton]] on the [[Manchester]]-to-Liverpool [[Turnpike road|turnpike]], he purchased a horse and a cart with several seats, and began an omnibus service between those two locations. His pioneering idea was to offer a service where, unlike with a [[Stagecoaches|stagecoach]], no prior booking was necessary and the driver would pick up or set down passengers anywhere on request.  Later on, he added daily services to [[Buxton]], [[Chester]], and [[Sheffield]]. His line immediately sparked fierce competition and a dense network of omnibus services quickly sprouted in the area, often acting as feeders to the railways. In 1865, Greenwood's company and its competitors amalgamated into the [[Manchester Carriage and Tramways Company|Manchester Carriage Company]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmts.co.uk/explore/history/history.html|title=A Short History of Public Transport in Greater Manchester}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Plan de la ville de Paris repr\u00e9sentant les nouvelles voitures publiques - Entreprise g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Dames Blanches.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A Paris omnibus in 1828]]\nThe Paris omnibus was started in 1828 by a businessman named Stanislas Baudry, who had begun the first French omnibus line in [[Nantes]] in 1826. The name was said to come from the station of the first line in Nantes, in front of the store of a hat-maker named Omnes, who had a large sign on his building saying \"Omnes Omnibus\"  (\"All for all\" in Latin).  Following success in Nantes, Baudry moved to Paris and founded the Enterprise des Omnibus  on rue de Lancre, with workshops on the quai de Jemmapes.   In 1827 he commissioned an English coach-maker, [[George Shillibeer]], to design a vehicle that could be stable and carry a large number of passengers. Shillibeer's design worked,   On 28 April 1828, the first Paris omnibus began service, running every fifteen minutes between La Madeleine and la Bastille.  Before long, there were one hundred omnibuses in service,  with eighteen different itineraries.  A journey cost twenty-five centimes.  The omnibuses circulated between seven in the morning and seven in the evening; each omnibus could carry between twelve and eighteen passengers.  The busiest line was that along the Grand Boulevards;  it ran from eight in the morning until midnight. {{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=1031-1032}}\n\nThe Paris omnibus service was an immediate popular success, with more than two and a half million passengers in the first six months.  However,  there was no reliable way to collect money from the passengers, or the fare collectors kept much of the money for themselves;  In its first years the company was continually on the verge of bankruptcy, and in despair, Baudry committed suicide in February 1830.   Baudry's partners reorganized the company and managed to keep it in business.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=1031-1032}}\n\nIn September 1828, a competing company, les Dames-Blanches, had started running its own vehicles.  In 1829 and the following years, more companies with poetic names entered the business;  les Citadines, les Tricycles, les Orl\u00e9anises, les Diligentes, les \u00c9cossaises, les B\u00e9arnaises, les Carolines, les Batignollaises, les Parisiennes, les Hirondelles, les Jos\u00e9phines, les Excellentes, les Sylphides, les Constantines, les Dames-Fran\u00e7aises,  les Alg\u00e9riennes, les Dames-R\u00e9unies, and les Gazelles.  The omnibus had a profound effect on Parisian life, making it possible for Parisians to work and have a social life outside their own neighborhoods.{{sfn|H\u00e9ron de Villefosse|1959|page=317}}\n\nBy 1845, there were thirteen companies in Paris operating twenty-twenty three omnibus lines. In 1855, [[Napoleon III]] had them combined into a single company, the Compagnie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des omnibus, with a monopoly on Paris public transportation. Beginning in 1873, they were gradually replaced by tramways, and, beginning in 1906, by the ''omnibus automobile'', or motor bus. The last horse-drawn Paris omnibus ran on 11 January 1913, from Saint-Sulpice to La Villette. {{sfn|Fierro|1996|pages=1031-1032}}\n[[File:Shillibeer's first omnibus.png|thumb|left|300px|Shillibeer's first London Omnibus (1829)]]\nShillibeer built another bus for the [[Quaker]] [[Newington Academy for Girls]] near London; this had a total of 25 seats, and entered history as the first [[school bus]].\nShillibeer saw the success of the Paris omnibus in service and concluded that operating similar vehicles in London,  for the fare-paying public with multiple stops, would be a paying enterprise, so he returned to his native city. His first London \"Omnibus\", using the same design and name as the Paris vehicle, took up service on 4 July 1829 on the route between [[Paddington]] (The [[Yorkshire Stingo]]) and \"Bank\" ([[Bank of England]])  via the \"[[New Road (eighteenth century north London turnpike road)|New Road]]\" (now [[Marylebone Road|Marylebone Rd]]), [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]] and [[City Road]]. Four services were provided in each direction daily.

Buses soon expanded their capacity, with additional seats for a few extra passengers provided alongside the driver. By 1845, passengers were being accommodated on the curved roofs, seated back to back in a configuration known as 'knife-board'.

The Siemens brothers, [[William Siemens|William]] in England and [[Ernst Werner von Siemens|Ernst Werner]] in Germany,  collaborated on the development of the trolleybus concept. Sir William first proposed the idea in an article to the ''[[Royal Society of Arts|Journal of the Society of Arts]]'' in 1881 as an \"...arrangement by which an ordinary omnibus...would have a suspender thrown at intervals from one side of the street to the other, and two wires hanging from these suspenders; allowing contact-rollers to run on these two wires, the current could be conveyed to the tram-car, and back again to the dynamo machine at the station, without the necessity of running upon rails at all.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.trolleybus.co.uk/history1.htm|title=Trolleybus history \u2013 current collector design}}</ref>\n\nThe first such vehicle, the [[Electromote]], was made by his brother Dr. Ernst Werner von Siemens and presented to the public in 1882 in [[Halensee]], [[German Empire|Germany]].<ref>[http://www.siemens.com/history/en/innovations/transportation.htm#toc-2 ''Elektromote''], Siemens History website.

Although this system operated only until 1904, Schiemann had developed what is now the standard trolleybus current collection system.

They then purchased the balance of the shares in 1943 to form the [[GMC (Truck)|GM Truck and Coach Division]].\n\nModels expanded in the 20th century, leading to the widespread introduction of the contemporary recognizable form of full-sized buses from the 1950s.

[[Bi-articulated bus]]es are also manufactured, and passenger-carrying trailers\u2014either towed behind a [[rigid bus]] (a [[Trailer (vehicle)|bus trailer]]), or hauled as a trailer by a [[truck]] (a [[trailer bus]]). Smaller [[midibus]]es have a lower capacity and [[open-top bus]]es are typically used for leisure purposes. In many new fleets, particularly in local transit systems, a shift to [[low-floor bus]]es is occurring, primarily for easier accessibility. Coaches are designed for longer-distance travel and are typically fitted with individual high-backed reclining seats, seat belts, toilets, and [[audio-visual]] entertainment systems, and can operate at higher speeds with more capacity for luggage. Coaches may be single- or double-deckers, articulated, and often include a separate luggage compartment under the passenger floor. [[Guided bus]]es are fitted with technology to allow them to run in designated guideways, allowing the controlled alignment at [[bus stop]]s and less space taken up by guided lanes than conventional roads or [[bus lane]]s.\n\n[[Bus manufacturing]] may be by a single company (an integral manufacturer), or by one manufacturer's building a bus body over a chassis produced by another manufacturer.\n\n==Design==\n\n===Accessibility===\n[[File:Praha, DOD 2006 Hostiva\u0159, Plo\u0161ina autobusu Karosa pro invalidy.JPG|thumb|Bus with [[wheelchair lift]] extended]]\n[[Transit bus]]es used to be mainly [[high-floor]] vehicles.  However, they are now increasingly of [[low-floor bus|low-floor]] design and optionally also 'kneel' [[air suspension]] and have electrically or hydraulically extended under-floor ramps to provide level access for [[wheelchair]] users and people with [[baby transport|baby carriages]]. Prior to more general use of such technology, these wheelchair users could only use specialist [[paratransit]] mobility buses.\n\nAccessible vehicles also have wider entrances and interior gangways and space for wheelchairs. Interior fittings and [[rollsign|destination displays]] may also be designed to be usable by the [[visually impaired]]. Coaches generally use [[wheelchair lift]]s instead of low-floor designs. In some countries, vehicles are required to have these features by [[Disability discrimination act|disability discrimination laws]].\n\n===Configuration===\nBuses were initially configured with an engine in the front and an entrance at the rear. With the transition to one-man operation, many manufacturers moved to mid- or rear-engined designs, with a single door at the front or multiple doors. The move to the low-floor design has all but eliminated the mid-engined design, although some coaches still have mid-mounted engines. Front-engined buses still persist for niche markets such as American school buses, some minibuses, and buses in less developed countries, which may be derived from truck chassis, rather than purpose-built bus designs. Most buses have two [[axles]], articulated buses have three.\n\n===Guidance===\n[[Guided bus]]es are fitted with technology to allow them to run in designated guideways, allowing the controlled alignment at bus stops and less space taken up by guided lanes than conventional roads or [[bus lane]]s. Guidance can be mechanical, optical, or electromagnetic. <!-- explain abbr. Guidance is often, but not exclusively, employed as part of a BRT scheme. --> Extensions of the guided technology include the [[Bombardier Guided Light Transit|Guided Light Transit]] and [[Translohr]] systems, although these are more often termed 'rubber-tyred trams' as they have limited or no mobility away from their guideways.\n\n===Liveries===\n[[Transit bus]]es are normally painted to identify the operator or a route, function, or to demarcate low-cost or premium service buses. Liveries may be painted onto the vehicle, applied using adhesive [[vinyl]] technologies, or using [[decal]]s. Vehicles often also carry [[bus advertising]] or part or all of their visible surfaces (as [[mobile billboard]]). [[Campaign bus]]es may be decorated with key campaign messages; these can be to promote an event or initiative.\n\n===Propulsion===\n[[File:Ride On 5312 at Glenmont.jpg|thumb|[[Ride On (bus)|Ride On]] [[hybrid electric bus]] with appropriate livery]]\n[[File:ASEAG 999 Seite.jpg|thumb|Articulated bus powered with [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]]]]\nThe most common power source since the 1920s has been the [[diesel engine]]. Early buses, known as trolleybuses, were powered by electricity supplied from [[overhead lines]]. Nowadays, electric buses often carry their own battery, which is sometimes [[Phileas (public transport)|recharged on stops/stations]] to keep the size of the battery small/lightweight. Currently, interest exists in [[hybrid electric bus]]es, [[fuel cell bus]]es, [[electric bus]]es, and ones powered by [[compressed natural gas]] or [[biodiesel]]. [[Gyrobus]]es, which are powered by the momentum stored by a [[flywheel]], were tried in the 1940s.\n\n===Dimensions===\n\n[[United Kingdom]]:\n\nMaximum Length: Single rear axle 13.5 meters.

Early buses were merely a bus body fitted to a truck chassis. This body+chassis approach has continued with modern specialist manufacturers, although there also exist integral designs such as the [[Leyland National]] where the two are practically inseparable. Specialist builders also exist and concentrate on building buses for special uses, or modifying standard buses into specialised products.\n\nIntegral designs have the advantages that they are have been well-tested for strength and stability, and also are [[Commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]]. However, two incentives cause use of the chassis+body model. First, it allows the buyer and manufacturer both to shop for the best deal for their needs, rather than having to settle on one fixed design\u2014the buyer can choose the body and the chassis separately. Second, over the lifetime of a vehicle (in constant service and heavy traffic), it will likely get minor damage now and again, and being able easily to replace a body panel or window etc. can vastly increase its [[service life]] and save the cost and inconvenience of removing it from service.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nAs with the rest of the [[automotive industry]], into the 20th century, bus manufacturing increasingly became globalized, with manufacturers producing buses far from their intended market to exploit labour and material cost advantages. As with the cars, new models are often exhibited by manufacturers at prestigious industry shows to gain new orders.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  A typical city bus costs almost US$450,000.<ref name=\"Gross\">{{cite web|last1=Gross|first1=Daniel|title=Further|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/the_juice/2014/09/electric_buses_proterra_wants_to_rid_america_of_emission_spewing_buses.html|website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=[[The Slate Group]]|accessdate=5 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Public transport===\n{{Main article|Public transport bus service}}\n[[File:NYC Transit New Flyer 840.jpg|thumb|A New Flyer C40LF public transit bus in [[Brooklyn]], New York]]\n[[Transit bus]]es, used on [[public transport bus service]]s, have utilitarian fittings designed for efficient movement of large numbers of people, and often have multiple doors. Coaches are used for longer-distance routes. High-capacity [[bus rapid transit]] services may use the bi-articulated bus or tram-style buses such as the [[Wright StreetCar]] and the [[Iveco Bus|Irisbus]] Civis.\n\nBuses and coach services often operate to a predetermined published [[public transport timetable]] defining the route and the timing, but smaller vehicles may be used on more flexible [[demand responsive transport]] services.\n\n===Tourism===\nBuses play a major part in the tourism industry. [[Tour bus]]es around the world allow tourists to view local attractions or scenery. These are often [[open-top bus]]es, but can also be by regular bus or coach.\n\n[[File:Historic Center of Quito - World Heritage Site by UNESCO - Photo 093.JPG|thumb|left|Tourists riding in a double-decker tourist bus in front of [[Carondelet Palace|The Presidential Palace]] in the [[Historic Center of Quito]], [[Ecuador]]]]\n\nIn local [[sightseeing]], [[City Sightseeing]] is the largest operator of local tour buses, operating on a franchised basis all over the world. Specialist tour buses are also often owned and operated by [[safari park]]s and other [[Amusement park|theme parks or resorts]]. Longer-distance tours are also carried out by bus, either on a turn up and go basis or through a [[tour operator]], and usually allow disembarkation from the bus to allow touring of sites of interest on foot. These may be day trips or longer [[excursion]]s incorporating hotel stays. Tour buses often carry a [[tour guide]], although the driver or a recorded [[audio commentary]] may also perform this function. The tour operator may itself be a subsidiary of a company that operates buses and coaches for other uses, or an independent company that charters buses or coaches. [[Commuter]] transport operators may also use their coaches to conduct tours within the target city between the morning and evening commuter transport journey.\n\nBuses and coaches are also a common component of the wider [[package holiday]] industry, providing private airport transfers (in addition to general [[airport bus]]es) and organised tours and day trips for holidaymakers on the package.\n\nTour buses can also be hired as chartered buses by groups as part of sightseeing at popular holiday destinations. These private tour buses may offer specific stops like all the historical sights or specifically casinos or allow the customers the comfort to make their own itineraries as per the places and activities they want to cover while on their tour. Tour buses come with professional and informed staff, insurance and maintain state governed safety standards.Not only this to make the experience for the tourists more comfortable provide facilities like entertainment units, luxurious reclining seats, large scenic windows and even lavatories, if needed.\n\nPublic long-distance coach networks are also often used as a low-cost method of travel by students or young people travelling the world. Some companies such as [[Topdeck Travel]] were set up to specifically use buses to drive the [[hippie trail]] or travel to places such as North Africa.\n\nIn many tourist or travel destinations, a bus is part of the [[tourist attraction]], such as the North American [[tourist trolley]]s, London's [[Routemaster]] [[London Buses heritage routes (disambiguation)|heritage route]]s, or the [[customised buses]] of Malta, Asia, and the Americas.\n\n===Student transport===\n[[File:First Student IC school bus 202076.jpg|thumb|US [[school bus]]]]\n{{Main article|Student transport}}\nIn some countries, particularly the USA and Canada, buses used to transport school children have evolved into a specific design with specified mandatory features.  American states have also adopted laws regarding motorist conduct around school buses, including serious fines and the possibility of prison time for passing a stopped school bus in the process of offloading children passengers. These [[school bus]]es feature things such as the [[school bus yellow]] livery and [[School bus crossing arm|crossing guards]]. Other countries may mandate the use of [[seat belts]]. As a minimum, many countries require a bus carrying students to display a [[:Commons:Category:School bus signs|sign]], and may also adopt yellow liveries. Student transport often uses older buses cascaded from service use, retrofitted with more seats and/or seatbelts. Student transport may be operated by local authorities or private contractors. Schools may also own and operate their own buses for other transport needs, such as class [[field trip]]s, or transport to associated sports, music, or other school events.\n\n===Private charter===\nDue to the costs involved in owning, operating, and driving buses and coaches, many bus and coach uses a [[private hire]] of vehicles from [[charter]] bus companies, either for a day or two, or a longer contract basis, where the charter company provides the vehicles and qualified drivers.\n\n[[File:Testspiel gegen FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen 03.JPG|thumb|left|An example of a private bus featuring as [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] football team bus]]\nCharter bus operators may be completely independent businesses, or charter hire may be a subsidiary business of a public transport operator that might maintain a separate fleet or use surplus buses, coaches, and dual-purpose coach-seated buses. Many private [[taxicab]] companies also operate larger [[minibus]] vehicles to cater for group fares. Companies, private groups, and social clubs may hire buses or coaches as a cost-effective method of transporting a group to an event or site, such as a group meeting, [[racing]] event, or organised recreational activity such as a [[summer camp]]. [[Schools]] often hire charter bus services on regular basis for transportation of children to and from their homes. Chartered buses are also used by education institutes for transport to [[convention (meeting)|convention]]s, [[exhibitions]] and [[field trips]]. Entertainment or event companies may also hire temporary shuttles buses for transport at events such as festivals or [[academic conference|conference]]s. [[Party bus]]es are used by companies in a similar manner to [[limousine]] hire, for luxury private transport to social events or as a touring experience. [[Sleeper bus]]es are used by [[band (music)|bands]] or other organisations that tour between entertainment venues and require mobile rest and recreation facilities. Some couples hire preserved buses for their [[wedding transport]] instead of the traditional car. Buses are often hired for [[parade]]s or [[procession]]s. [[Victory parade]]s are often held for triumphant sports teams, who often tour their home town or city in an [[open-top bus]]. Sports teams may also contract out their transport to a [[team bus]], for travel to [[Road (sports)|away games]], to a [[Sports competition|competition]] or to a [[Final (competition)|final event]]. These buses are often specially decorated in a livery matching the team colours. Private companies often contract out private shuttle bus services, for transport of their customers or patrons, such as hotels, [[amusement park]]s, [[university campus]]es, or [[airport bus|private airport transfer]] services. This shuttle usage can be as transport between locations, or to and from [[parking lot]]s. High specification luxury coaches are often chartered by companies for [[Executive officer|executive]] or [[Very Important Person|VIP]] transport. Charter buses may also be used in tourism and for promotion (See Tourism and Promotion sections)\n\n===Private ownership===\nMany organisations, including the police, [[not for profit]], social or charitable groups with a regular need for group transport may find it practical or cost-effective to own and operate a bus for their own needs. These are often [[minibus]]es for practical, tax and driver licensing reasons, although they can also be full size buses. [[Cadet]] or [[Scouting|scout]] groups or other youth organizations may also own buses. Specific charities may exist to fund and operate bus transport, usually using specially modified mobility buses or otherwise accessible buses (See Accessibility section). Some use their contributions to buy vehicles, and provide volunteer drivers.\n\nAirport operators make use of special airside [[airport bus]]es for crew and passenger transport in the secure [[Airside (airport)|airside]] parts of an airport. Some public authorities, police forces and military forces make use of [[armoured bus]]es where there is a special need to provide increased passenger protection.  The [[United States Secret Service]] acquired two in 2010 for transporting dignitaries needing special protection.<ref>{{cite web | author=Robert Farley |title=Obama's Canadian-American Bus | url=http://www.factcheck.org/2011/08/obamas-canadian-american-bus/ | work=FactCheck  |date=25 August 2011 | accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref> [[Police department]]s make use of [[police bus]]es for a variety of reasons, such as [[Prisoner transport vehicle|prisoner transport]], [[police officer|officer]] transport, temporary detention facilities, and as [[command post|command and control vehicles]]. Some [[fire department]]s also use a converted bus as a command post,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cityofchesapeake.net/services/depart/fire/bus.shtml |title=Chesapeake Fire Department |publisher=Cityofchesapeake.net |date=1 May 1998 |accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref> while those in cold climates might retain a bus as a heated shelter at fire scenes.<ref>{{cite web|author=City of Winnipeg Corporate Web Services |url=http://www.winnipeg.ca/fps/Services/Operations/MIRV.stm |title=Winnipeg Fire Department |publisher=Winnipeg.ca |accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref>  Many are drawn from retired school or service buses.\n\n===Promotion===\nBuses are often used for advertising, [[political campaign]]ing, [[:Category:Public service announcements|public information campaigns]], [[public relation]]s or [[Promotion (marketing)|promotional]] purposes. These may take the form of temporary charter hire of service buses, or the temporary or permanent conversion and operation of buses, usually of [[Used good|second-hand]] buses. Extreme examples include converting the bus with displays and decorations or [[awning]]s and fittings. Interiors may be fitted out for exhibition or information purposes with special equipment and/or [[audio visual]] devices.\n\n[[Bus advertising]] takes many forms, often as interior and exterior adverts and all-over advertising liveries. The practice often extends into the exclusive private hire and use of a bus to promote a brand or product, appearing at large public events, or touring busy streets. The bus is sometimes staffed by promotions personnel, giving out free gifts. [[Campaign bus]]es are often specially decorated for a [[political campaign]] or other social awareness information campaign, designed to bring a specific message to different areas, and/or used to transport campaign personnel to local areas/meetings. Exhibition buses are often sent to public events such as [[fair]]s and festivals for purposes such as recruitment campaigns, for example by private companies or the [[armed force]]s. Complex [[urban planning]] proposals may be organised into a mobile exhibition bus for the purposes of public consultation.\n\n==Around the world==\n[[File:T\u00e5gbussen.jpg|thumb|T\u00e5gbussen]]\n[[File:Alexandria Double decker bus.JPG|thumb|right|Double decker bus in [[Alexandria, Egypt]]]]\n{{See also|Category:Bus transport by country|List of buses}}\nHistorically, the types and features of buses have developed according to local needs. Buses were fitted with technology appropriate to the local climate or passenger needs, such as air conditioning in Asia, or [[Bicycle|cycle]] mounts on North American buses. The bus types in use around the world where there was little mass production were often sourced second hand from other countries, such as the [[Malta bus]], and buses in use in Africa. Other countries such as Cuba required novel solutions to import restrictions, with the creation of the \"camellos\" ([[camel]] bus), a specially manufactured [[trailer bus]].\n\nAfter the Second World War, manufacturers in Europe and the Far East, such as [[Mercedes-Benz buses]] and [[Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation|Mitsubishi Fuso]] expanded into other continents influencing the use of buses previously served by local types. Use of buses around the world has also been influenced by colonial associations or political alliances between countries. Several of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]] followed the British lead and sourced buses from British manufacturers, leading to a prevalence of [[double-decker bus]]es. Several [[Eastern Bloc]] countries adopted trolleybus systems, and their manufacturers such as [[Trolza]] exported trolleybuses to other friendly states.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} In the 1930s Italy designed the world's only{{dubious|Triple decker bus|date=March 2013}} triple decker bus for the busy route between Rome and Tivoli that could carry eighty-eight passengers.  It was unique not only in being a triple decker but having a separate smoking compartment on the third level.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=7-EDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA286&dq=popular+mechanics+1932+the+president+of+a+big&hl=en&ei=JIgVTcvHIM2AnQf50_3fDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Three Decker Auto Bus Carries 88 Persons\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1932</ref>\n\nThe buses to be found in countries around the world often reflect the quality of the local road network, with high floor resilient truck based designs prevalent in several less developed countries where buses are subject to tough operating conditions. Population density also has a major impact, where dense urbanisation such as in Japan and the far east has led to the adoption of high capacity long [[multi-axle bus]]es, often double-deckers, while South America and China are implementing large numbers of [[articulated bus]]es for [[bus rapid transit]] schemes.\n\n===Bus expositions===\nEuro Bus Expo is a [[Trade fair|trade show]], which is held bi-ennially at the UK's [[National Exhibition Centre]] in Birmingham. As the official show of the [[Confederation of Passenger Transport]], the UK's trade association for the bus, coach and light rail industry, the three-day event offers visitors from Europe and beyond the chance to see and experience, at first hand, the very latest vehicles and product and service innovations right across the industry. The next show will be held in November 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurobusxpo.com |title=Euro Bus Expo : Welcome to the European coach & bus industry exhibition |publisher=Eurobusxpo.com |accessdate=2013-04-17}}</ref>\n\nBusworld Kortrijk in [[Kortrijk]], Belgium, is the leading bus trade fair in Europe. It is held bi-ennially, last time October 2013 and next time October 2015.\n\n==Use of retired buses==\n[[File:GMBus.jpg|thumb|left|Retired [[General Motors|GM]] bus]]\n[[File:EM-leyland-tow-truck-1.jpg|thumb|left|Retired bus used as a tow truck.]]\n\nMost public or private buses and coaches, once they have reached the end of their service with one or more operators, are sent to the [[wrecking yard]] for breaking up for [[scrap]] and [[spare part]]s. Some buses, while not economical to keep running as service buses, are often converted in some way for use by the operator, or another user, for purposes other than revenue earning transport. Much like old cars and trucks, buses often pass through a [[Car dealership|dealership]] where they can be bought for a price or at auction.\n\nBus operators will often find it economical to convert retired buses to use as permanent [[training bus]]es for driver training, rather than taking a regular service bus out of use. Some large operators also converted retired buses into tow bus vehicles, to act as [[tow truck]]s. With the outsourcing of maintenance staff and facilities, the increase in company [[health and safety]] regulations, and the increasing [[curb weight]]s of buses, many operators now contract their towing needs to a professional [[vehicle recovery]] company.\n\nSome retired buses have been converted to static or mobile caf\u00e9s, often using historic buses as a [[tourist attraction]]. Food is also provided from a catering bus, in which a bus is converted into a mobile [[Canteen (place)|canteen]] and [[Coffee break|break room]]. These are commonly seen at external [[filming location]]s to feed the cast and crew, and at other large events to feed staff. Another use is as an emergency vehicle, such as high-capacity [[ambulance bus]] or mobile [[command center]].\n\nSome organisations adapt and operate [[playbus]]es or learning buses to provide a [[playground]] or learning environments to children who might not have access to proper play areas. An ex-London [[Routemaster]] bus has been converted to a mobile theatre and [[Runway (fashion)|catwalk fashion show]].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/aug/16/theatre.londonlistings1 Event preview: Fashion Bus On The Square, London] ''The Guardian'', 16 August 2008</ref>\n\nSome buses meet a destructive end by being entered in [[banger racing|banger races]] or at [[demolition derby]]s. A larger number of old retired buses have also been converted into mobile holiday homes and campers.\n\n===Bus preservation===\nRather than being [[wikt:scrapped|scrapped]] or converted for other uses, sometimes retired buses are saved for preservation. This can be done by individuals, volunteer preservation groups or charitable trusts, museums, or sometimes by the operators themselves as part of a [[heritage fleet]]. These buses often need to undergo a degree of [[vehicle restoration]] to restore them to their original condition, and will have their livery and other details such as internal notices and [[rollsign]]s restored to be authentic to a specific time in the bus's actual history. Some buses that undergo preservation are rescued from a state of great disrepair, but others enter preservation with very little wrong with them. As with other historic vehicles, many preserved buses either in a working or static state form part of the collections of [[List of transport museums|transport museums]]. Working buses will often be exhibited at rallies and events, and they are also used as charter buses. While many preserved buses are quite old or even vintage, in some cases relatively new examples of a bus type can enter restoration. In-service examples are still in use by other operators. This often happens when a change in design or operating practice, such as the switch to one person operation or low floor technology, renders some buses redundant while still relatively new.\n\n==Modification as railway vehicles==\n{{unreferenced-section|date=August 2016}}\nSuitable buses to modify as passenger [[train]] cars are buses that are primarily used as [[school buses]], factory buses, activity buses, military buses and police buses.  Buses built by [[Germany|German]] manufacturers such as [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[Setra]], cannot be modified as railway vehicles. Buses and [[motor vehicles]] of other kinds are not allowed to travel along railway lines in [[Pakistan]].\n\n===Country of origin===\nBuses are built in many different countries such as [[Japan]], [[China]], [[South Korea]], [[Sweden]] and other countries. Right-hand drive buses can only be modified as railway vehicles for use in countries where motor vehicle drivers drive on the right side of the road and Left-hand drive buses can only be modified as railway vehicles in countries where motor vehicle drivers drive on the left side of the road.\n\n===Link doors===\nLink doors enable people to walk along in the train in case of an emergency.\n\n====Front link doors====\nThe front link [[door]] has to be mounted on the suitable position on the front end of the bus.\n\nA. '''Buses with driver's seat elevated high''' must have their front [[windscreen]]s minimized upwards, making it possible to install the front link door at the bottom of the [[windscreen]].\n* On right-hand drive buses, the link door must be installed on the left side of the driver's dashboard, making it possible to install the [[railway coupler]] on the front of the bus.\n* On left-hand drive buses, the link door must be installed on the right side of the driver's dashboard, making it possible to install \nthe [[railway coupler]] on the front of the bus.\n\nB. '''Buses with driver's seat elevated low''' must be fitted a front link door over the driver's [[cockpit]] and a passageway to the front link door next to the aisle.\n\nI) '''Buses with no passenger observation deck above driver's compartment''' must have the front link door installed in the suitable position.\n\n1. '''Buses with no horizontally divided front windscreens''' must have the front link door installed in the suitable position.\n* On right-hand drive buses, the link door must be installed in the right.\n* On left-hand drive buses, the link door must be installed in the left.\n\n2. '''Buses with front windscreen divided horizontally into two similar sections''' must have the front link door installed in the upper section of the front [[windscreen]].\n* On right-hand drive buses, the link door must be installed in the right.\n* On left-hand drive buses, the link door must be installed in the left.\n\nII) '''Buses with passenger observation deck above driver's compartment''' must have the front link door installed in the upper section of the front [[windscreen]], either in the left, centered or in the right for both left-hand drive buses and right-hand drive buses.\n\nC. '''Low-height single-deck commuter or transit buses''' must have the front link door installed over the driver's [[cockpit]].\n\n====Rear link doors====\nThe rear link door must be installed in the suitable position in the rear end of the bus.\n\nA. '''Buses with driver's seat elevated high''' must have their rear [[window]]s minimized upwards if the rear window of each bus is protruding downwards, to make easier to install the rear link door on the rear end of the bus.\n\nI) '''Rear-engined buses''' must have the rear link door installed in the suitable position on the rear of the bus.\n\n1. On each rear-engined bus, if the [[engine]] [[Internal combustion engine cooling|cooling system]]'s [[radiator]] is mounted in the left or in the right, the rear link door must be installed at the bottom of the rear window.\n* On right-hand drive buses, the rear link door must be installed in the right, making it possible to install the [[railway coupler]] on the rear of the bus.\n* On left-hand drive buses, the rear link door must be installed in the left, making it possible to install the [[railway coupler]] on the rear of the bus.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal bar|Buses|Transport}}\n{{div col|3}}\n* [[Bicycle carrier]] (bus mounted bike racks)\n* [[BRTS]]\n* [[Bus spotting]]\n* [[Bus station]]\n* [[Cutaway bus]]\n* [[Dollar van]]\n* [[Intercity bus]]\n* [[Intercity bus driver]]\n* [[List of fictional buses]]\n* [[Motor bus]]\n* [[Public light bus]]\n* [[Trackless train]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=Ward1974>{{Citation |title=The World of Automobiles: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Motor Car |volume=15 |first= Ian |last= Ward |publisher= Orbis |year= 1974 |page= 1773 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name= Eckermann2001>{{Citation |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yLZeQwqNmdgC&pg=PA687#v=onepage&q&f=false |title= World History of the Automobile |first= Erik |last= Eckermann |publisher= SAE |year= 2001 |ISBN= 9780768008005  |pages= 67\u201368 |accessdate= 6 October 2013 }}</ref>\n}}\n* {{EB1911}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|last=Combeau|first=Yvan|title=Histoire de Paris|year=2013|publisher=Presses Universitaires de France|location=Paris|ISBN=978-2-13-060852-3|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Fierro|first=Alfred|title=Histoire et dictionnaire de Paris|year=1996|publisher=Robert Laffont|ISBN=2-221-07862-4|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=H\u00e9ron de Villefosse|first=Ren\u00e9|title=HIstoire de Paris|year=1959|publisher=Bernard Grasset|ref=harv}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons and category-inline|Bus|Bus transport}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n* [http://www.buses.org American Bus Association]\n\n{{buses}}\n{{public transport}}\n{{bus rapid transit}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2012}}\n\n[[Category:Bus transport| ]]\n[[Category:Buses| ]]\n[[Category:French inventions]]"}]}}}}
