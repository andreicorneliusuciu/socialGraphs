Invented by [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] in 1958, the original ballute was a cone-shaped balloon with a [[toroid]]al burble fence fitted around its widest point. A burble fence is an inflated structure intended to ensure [[flow separation]].<ref>http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19690017080_1969017080.pdf</ref> This stabilizes the ballute as it decelerates through different flow regimes (from supersonic to subsonic).\n\nThe ballute is either inflated by a gas generator or by air forced into the structure by ram air inlets.\n\nBallutes have also been proposed in stacked toroidal and tension cone form factors, in addition to the more standard isotensoid ballute.<ref name=ss2011/>\n\n==Applications==\nThe ballute has been used as a retarding device for freefall [[gravity bomb|bombs]] dropped from aircraft.\n\nIt was used as part of the escape equipment for the [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] spacecraft.<ref>http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4203/ch8-4.htm</ref>\nIt has been proposed for use during [[aerocapture]] and [[aerobraking]]. In the 1985 film [[2010: The Year We Make Contact]], a ballute is used on the space vehicle ''Leonov'' to establish a gentle orbit around Jupiter.<ref name=as20111224>\n{{cite web |title=Reentry System\u2014CubeSat Recovery System|url=http://www.andrews-space.com/content-main.php?mainsection=Mjc2 |year=2008 |publisher=Andrews Space |accessdate=2011-12-24 }}</ref>\n\nExtended designs using inflatable tension cone ballute technology have been proposed for deorbiting [[Nanosatellite|NanoSats]] and recovering low-mass (< {{convert|1.5|kg}}) [[satellite]]s from [[low Earth orbit]].<ref name=ss2011>\n{{cite web|title=NanoSat Deorbit and Recovery System (DRS) to Enable New Missions |url=http://www.andrews-space.com/brochures/Publications/AndrewsSpace-SmallSat2011-NanosatelliteDeorbitandRecovery.pdf |work=conference paper |publisher=Small Sat 2011 |accessdate=2012-01-22 }}</ref>\n\nArmadillo Aerospace used a ballute in the testing of its STIG-A rocket in early 2012.<ref name=aa2012>\n{{cite web|title=Armadillo Launches a STIG-A Rocket - Captures Awesome Image of Ballute|url=http://www.universetoday.com/93281/armadillo-launches-a-stig-a-rocket-captures-awesome-image-of-ballute/ |accessdate=2012-07-17}}</ref>\n\nDanish nonprofit aerospace organization [[Copenhagen Suborbitals]] is testing a ballute for its Nexo rockets as of February 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Copenhagen Suborbitals Ballute |url=http://ing.dk/blog/warp-speed-mr-zulu-173845#utm_sguid=148973,62ce2c23-4248-3d48-9390-4124bb03e73f |year=2015 |publisher=[[Ingeni\u00f8ren]] |accessdate=2015-02-12}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* http://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bullet103/marraffa103.pdf\n* http://www.parachutehistory.com/other/ballute.html\n\n[[Category:Spacecraft components]]\n[[Category:Aircraft components]]\n[[Category:Spaceflight technologies]]"}]}}}}
