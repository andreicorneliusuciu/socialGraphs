(''Columbia's'' first launch shown)]]\n\nA '''spacecraft''' is a vehicle, or machine designed to [[spaceflight|fly in outer space]]. Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including [[Telecommunications|communications]], [[Earth observation satellite|earth observation]], [[Weather satellite|meteorology]], [[navigation]], [[space colonization]], [[Planetary science|planetary exploration]], and [[Space transport|transportation]] of [[Human spaceflight|humans]] and [[Unmanned resupply spacecraft|cargo]].\n\nOn a [[sub-orbital spaceflight]], a spacecraft enters [[outer space|space]] and then returns to the surface, without having gone into an [[orbit]]. For [[orbital spaceflight]]s, spacecraft enter closed orbits around the [[Earth]] or around other [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]]. Spacecraft used for human spaceflight carry people on board as crew or passengers from start or on orbit ([[space station]]s) only, whereas those used for [[robotic space mission]]s operate either [[autonomous robot|autonomously]] or [[telerobotics|telerobotically]]. [[Robotic spacecraft]] used to support scientific research are [[space probe]]s. Robotic spacecraft that remain in orbit around a planetary body are artificial [[satellite]]s. Only a handful of [[interstellar probe]]s, such as ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' and ''[[Pioneer 11|11]]'', ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2|2]]'', and ''[[New Horizons]]'', are on trajectories that leave the [[Solar System]].\n\nOrbital spacecraft may be recoverable or not. By method of [[Atmospheric entry|reentry]] to Earth they may be divided in non-winged [[space capsule]]s and winged [[spaceplane]]s.\n\nHumanity has achieved space flight but [[Timeline of first orbital launches by country|only a few nations have the technology for orbital launches]], including: Russia ([[Roskosmos]]), the United States ([[NASA]]), the member states of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), Japan ([[JAXA]]), India ([[ISRO]]), and China ([[CNSA]]).\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of spaceflight}}\n[[File:Sputnik-1.jpg|thumb|upright|The first artificial satellite, [[Sputnik]]]]\n\n[[Sputnik]] was the first [[artificial satellite]]. It was launched into an elliptical [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) by the [[Soviet Union]] on 4 October 1957. The launch ushered in new political, military, technological, and scientific developments;  while the Sputnik launch was a single event, it marked the start of the [[Space Age]].<ref name=\"test\">[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2010/4/2010_4_88.shtml Walter A.

Jr.|last2=Grimwood|first2=J. M.|last3=Alexander|first3=C. C.|page=66-62424}}</ref> Apart from its value as a technological first, ''Sputnik'' also helped to identify the upper [[Earth's atmosphere#Temperature and the atmospheric layers|atmospheric layer]]'s density, through measuring the satellite's orbital changes. It also provided data on [[radio]]-signal distribution in the [[ionosphere]]. Pressurized [[nitrogen]] in the satellite's false body provided the first opportunity for [[meteoroid]] detection. ''Sputnik 1'' was launched during the [[International Geophysical Year]] from [[Gagarin's Start|Site No.1/5]], at the 5th [[Tyuratam]] range, in [[Kazakh SSR]] (now at the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]]). The satellite travelled at 29,000 kilometers (18,000&nbsp;mi) per hour, taking 96.2 minutes to complete an orbit, and emitted radio signals at 20.005 and 40.002&nbsp;[[MHz]]\n\nWhile Sputnik 1 was the first spacecraft to orbit the Earth, other man-made objects had previously reached an altitude of 100&nbsp;km, which is the height required by the international organization [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale]] to count as a spaceflight. This altitude is called the [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line]]. In particular, in the 1940s there were [[List of V-2 test launches|several test launches]] of the [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] [[rocket]], some of which reached altitudes well over 100&nbsp;km.\n\n==Past and present spacecraft==\n\n===Manned spacecraft===\n{{see also|List of manned spacecraft|Human spaceflight}} \nAs of 2016, only three nations have flown manned spacecraft: USSR/Russia, USA, and China. \nThe first manned spacecraft was [[Vostok 1]], which carried Soviet cosmonaut [[Yuri Gagarin]] into space in 1961, and completed a full Earth orbit. There were five other manned missions which used a [[Vostok spacecraft]].<ref name=EA-vostok>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/vostok.htm|title=Vostok|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica}}</ref> The second manned spacecraft was named [[Mercury-Redstone 3|''Freedom 7'']], and it performed a [[sub-orbital spaceflight]] in 1961 carrying American astronaut [[Alan Shepard]] to an altitude of just over {{convert|187|km|sp=us}}. There were five other manned missions using [[Project Mercury|Mercury spacecraft]].\n\nOther Soviet manned spacecraft include the [[Voskhod spacecraft|Voskhod]], [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]], flown unmanned as [[Soyuz 7K-L1|Zond/L1]], [[Soyuz 7K-L3|L3]], [[TKS spacecraft|TKS]], and the [[Salyut program|Salyut]] and ''[[Mir]]'' manned [[space station]]s. Other American manned spacecraft include the [[Project Gemini|Gemini Spacecraft]], [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo Spacecraft]], the [[Skylab]] space station, and the [[Space Shuttle orbiter|Space Shuttle]] with undetached European [[Spacelab]] and private US [[Spacehab]] space stations-modules. China developed, but did not fly [[Shuguang]], and is currently using [[Shenzhou program|Shenzhou]] (its first manned mission was in 2003).\n\nExcept for the space shuttle, all of the recoverable manned orbital spacecraft were [[space capsule]]s.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Manned space capsules\" class=center>\nFile:Vostok spacecraft diagram.png |alt=Line drawing of Vostok capsule |Soviet Vostok capsule\nFile:NASA spacecraft comparison.jpg |alt=Drawings of Mercury, Gemini capsules and Apollo spacecraft, with their launch rockets|American Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo spacecraft\nFile:Voskhod 1 and 2.png |alt=Line drawing of Voskhod capsules |Soviet Voskhod (variant of Vostok)\nFile:Soyuz 7K-OK(A) drawing.svg |alt=Soyuz 7K-OK(A) drawing |1967 Soviet/Russian Soyuz spacecraft\nFile:Post S-7 Shenzhou spacecraft.png |alt=Drawing of Shenzhou spacecraft |Chinese Shenzhou\n</gallery>\n\nThe [[International Space Station]], manned since November 2000, is a joint venture between Russia, the United States, Canada and several other countries.\n\n====Spaceplanes====\n{{main|Spaceplane}}\n[[File:STS-73 landing.jpg|thumb|Columbia orbiter landing]]\nSome reusable vehicles have been designed only for manned spaceflight, and these are often called spaceplanes. The first example of such was the [[North American X-15]] spaceplane, which conducted two manned flights which reached an altitude of over 100&nbsp;km in the 1960s.  The first reusable spacecraft, the [[X-15]], was air-launched on a suborbital trajectory on July 19, 1963.\n\nThe first partially reusable orbital spacecraft, a winged non-capsule, the [[Space Shuttle]], was launched by the USA on the 20th anniversary of [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s flight, on April 12, 1981. During the Shuttle era, six orbiters were built, all of which have flown in the atmosphere and five of which have flown in space. ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'' was used only for approach and landing tests, launching from the back of a [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft|Boeing 747 SCA]] and gliding to deadstick landings at [[Edwards AFB, California]]. The first Space Shuttle to fly into space was ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', followed by ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''. ''Endeavour'' was built to replace ''Challenger'' when it was [[STS-51-L|lost]] in January 1986. ''Columbia'' [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|broke up]] during reentry in February 2003.\n\nThe first automatic partially reusable spacecraft was the [[Shuttle Buran|Buran]] (Snowstorm), launched by the USSR on November 15, 1988, although it made only one flight and this was unmanned. This [[spaceplane]] was designed for a crew and strongly resembled the U.S. Space Shuttle, although its drop-off boosters used liquid propellants and its main engines were located at the base of what would be the external tank in the American Shuttle. Lack of funding, complicated by the [[dissolution of the USSR]], prevented any further flights of Buran. The Space Shuttle was subsequently modified to allow for autonomous re-entry in case of necessity.\n\nPer the [[Vision for Space Exploration]], the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011 due mainly to its old age and high cost of program reaching over a billion dollars per flight. The Shuttle's human transport role is to be replaced by [[Space X]]'s [[Dragon V2]] and [[Boeing]]'s [[CST-100 Starliner]] no later than 2017. The Shuttle's heavy cargo transport role is to be replaced by expendable rockets such as the [[Space Launch System]] and SpaceX's [[Falcon Heavy]].\n\n[[Scaled Composites]]' [[SpaceShipOne]] was a reusable suborbital [[spaceplane]] that carried pilots [[Mike Melvill]] and [[Brian Binnie]] on consecutive flights in 2004 to win the [[Ansari X Prize]]. [[The Spaceship Company]] will build its successor [[SpaceShipTwo]]. A fleet of SpaceShipTwos operated by [[Virgin Galactic]] was planned to begin reusable [[private spaceflight]] carrying paying passengers in 2014, but was delayed after the [[VSS Enterprise crash]].\n\n===Unmanned spacecraft===\n{{See also|List of unmanned spacecraft by program|Timeline of spaceflight|Timeline of artificial satellites and space probes|List of Solar System probes|Space probe|Robotic spacecraft | Unmanned resupply spacecraft | Satellite}}\n[[File:Hubble 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Hubble Space Telescope]]]]\n[[File:Iss016e034191.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jules Verne ATV|Jules Verne Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV)]] approaches the [[International Space Station]] on Monday, March 31, 2008.]]\n\n{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}\n\n====Designed as manned but flown as unmanned only spacecraft====\n* [[Soyuz 7K-L1|Zond/L1]] \u2013 lunar flyby capsule\n* [[Soyuz 7K-L3|L3]] \u2013 capsule and lunar lander\n* [[TKS spacecraft|TKS]] \u2013 capsule\n* [[Buran (spacecraft)|''Buran''-class shuttle]] \u2013 Soviet shuttle\n\n====Semi-manned \u2013 manned as space stations or part of space stations====\n* [[Progress spacecraft|Progress]] \u2013 unmanned USSR/Russia cargo spacecraft\n* [[TKS spacecraft|TKS]] \u2013 unmanned USSR/Russia cargo spacecraft and space station module\n* [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] (ATV) \u2013 unmanned European cargo spacecraft\n* [[H-II Transfer Vehicle]] (HTV) \u2013 unmanned Japanese cargo spacecraft\n* [[SpaceX Dragon]] \u2013 unmanned private spacecraft\n* [[Tianzhou 1(spacecraft)]] \u2013 China's unmanned spacecraft\n\n====Earth-orbit satellites====\n* [[Explorer 1]] \u2013 first US satellite\n* [[Project SCORE]] \u2013 first communications satellite\n* [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] -

Spacecraft subsystems comprise the spacecraft's \"[[Spacecraft bus|bus]]\" and may include attitude determination and control (variously called ADAC, ADC, or ACS), guidance, navigation and control (GNC or GN&C), communications (comms), command and data handling (CDH or C&DH), power (EPS), [[spacecraft thermal control|thermal control]] (TCS), propulsion, and structures. Attached to the bus are typically [[payload]]s.\n\n; Life support\n: Spacecraft intended for human spaceflight must also include a [[life support system]] for the crew.\n\n[[File:Shuttle front RCS.jpg|thumb|[[Reaction control system]] thrusters on the front of the U.S. [[Space Shuttle]]]]\n\n; Attitude control\n: A Spacecraft needs an [[attitude control]] subsystem to be correctly oriented in space and respond to external [[torque]]s and forces properly. The attitude control subsystem consists of [[sensor]]s and [[actuator]]s, together with controlling algorithms. The attitude-control subsystem permits proper pointing for the science objective, sun pointing for power to the solar arrays and earth pointing for communications.\n\n; GNC\n: Guidance refers to the calculation of the commands (usually done by the CDH subsystem) needed to steer the spacecraft where it is desired to be. Navigation means determining a spacecraft's [[orbital elements]] or position. Control means adjusting the path of the spacecraft to meet mission requirements.\n\n; Command and data handling\n: The CDH subsystem receives commands from the communications subsystem, performs validation and decoding of the commands, and distributes the commands to the appropriate spacecraft subsystems and components. The CDH also receives housekeeping data and science data from the other spacecraft subsystems and components, and packages the data for storage on a [[data recorder]] or transmission to the ground via the communications subsystem. Other functions of the CDH include maintaining the spacecraft clock and state-of-health monitoring.\n{{further|On-Board Data Handling}}\n\n; Communications\n: Spacecraft, both [[Robotic spacecraft|robotic]] and [[Human spaceflight|crewed]], utilize various communications systems for communication with terrestrial stations as well as for communication between spacecraft in space. Technologies utilized include [[Radio-frequency communication|RF]] and [[Free-space optical communication|optical]] communication. In addition, some spacecraft payloads are explicitly for the purpose of ground\u2013ground [[Commsat|communication]] using [[Bent pipe|receiver/retransmitter]] electronic technologies.\n\n; Power\n: Spacecraft need an electrical power generation and distribution subsystem for powering the various spacecraft subsystems. For spacecraft near the [[Sun]], [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]] are frequently used to generate electrical power. Spacecraft designed to operate in more distant locations, for example [[Jupiter]], might employ a [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] (RTG) to generate electrical power. Electrical power is sent through power conditioning equipment before it passes through a power distribution unit over an electrical bus to other spacecraft components. Batteries are typically connected to the bus via a battery charge regulator, and the batteries are used to provide electrical power during periods when primary power is not available, for example when a low Earth orbit spacecraft is [[eclipsed]] by Earth.\n\n; Thermal control\n: Spacecraft must be engineered to withstand transit through [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] and the [[space environment]]. They must operate in a [[vacuum]] with temperatures potentially ranging across hundreds of degrees [[Celsius]] as well as (if subject to reentry) in the presence of plasmas. Material requirements are such that either high melting temperature, low density materials such as [[beryllium]] and [[reinforced carbon\u2013carbon]] or (possibly due to the lower thickness requirements despite its high density) [[tungsten]] or [[Ablation|ablative]] carbon\u2013carbon composites are used. Depending on mission profile, spacecraft may also need to operate on the surface of another planetary body. The [[thermal control subsystem]] can be passive, dependent on the selection of materials with specific radiative properties. Active thermal control makes use of electrical heaters and certain [[actuators]] such as louvers to control temperature ranges of equipments within specific ranges.\n\n; [[Spacecraft propulsion]]\n: Spacecraft may or may not have a [[Spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] subsystem, depending on whether or not the mission profile calls for propulsion. The [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|''Swift'']] spacecraft is an example of a spacecraft that does not have a propulsion subsystem. Typically though, LEO spacecraft include a propulsion subsystem for altitude adjustments (drag make-up maneuvers) and [[inclination]] adjustment maneuvers. A propulsion system is also needed for spacecraft that perform momentum management maneuvers. Components of a conventional propulsion subsystem include fuel, tankage, valves, pipes, and [[Rocket engine|thruster]]s. The thermal control system interfaces with the propulsion subsystem by monitoring the temperature of those components, and by preheating tanks and thrusters in preparation for a spacecraft maneuver.\n\n; Structures\n: Spacecraft must be engineered to withstand launch loads imparted by the launch vehicle, and must have a point of attachment for all the other subsystems. Depending on mission profile, the structural subsystem might need to withstand loads imparted by entry into the [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere of another planetary body]], and landing on the surface of another planetary body.\n\n; Payload\n: The payload depends on the mission of the spacecraft, and is typically regarded as the part of the spacecraft \"that pays the bills\". Typical payloads could include scientific instruments ([[camera]]s, [[telescope]]s, or [[particle detector]]s, for example), cargo, or a [[Human spaceflight|human crew]].\n\n; Ground segment\n{{main|Ground segment}}\n: The [[ground segment]], though not technically part of the spacecraft, is vital to the operation of the spacecraft. Typical components of a ground segment in use during normal operations include a mission operations facility where the flight operations team conducts the operations of the spacecraft, a data processing and storage facility, [[Earth station|ground stations]] to radiate signals to and receive signals from the spacecraft, and a voice and data communications network to connect all mission elements.<ref name=\"Rosettaground\">{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Rosetta/SEMDV71PGQD_0.html |title=The Rosetta ground segment |work=ESA.int |date=2004-02-17 |accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref>\n\n; Launch vehicle\n: The [[launch vehicle]] propels the spacecraft from Earth's surface, through the [[atmosphere]], and into an [[orbit]], the exact orbit being dependent on the mission configuration. The launch vehicle may be [[Expendable launch system|expendable]] or [[Reusable launch system|reusable]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n{{colbegin||30em}}\n*[[Ansari X Prize]]\n*[[Astrionics]]\n*[[Atmospheric entry]]\n*[[Earth to orbit]]\n*[[Flying saucer]]\n*[[List of fictional spacecraft]]\n*[[Timeline of spaceflight]]\n*[[Spacecraft design]]\n*[[Spacecraft propulsion]]\n*[[Space exploration]]\n*[[Space suit]]\n*[[List of spaceflight records|Spaceflight records]]\n*[[Starship]]\n*[[Timeline of Solar System exploration]]\n*[[U.S. Space Exploration History on U.S. Stamps]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |title=Space Mission Analysis and Design |publisher=Microcosm |location=Torrance, CA |first=James |last=Wertz |author2=Larson, Wiley J  |edition=3rd |year=1999 |isbn=978-1-881883-10-4}}\n* {{cite journal |url=http://www.newscientistspace.com/article.ns?id=dn8623 |title=Spacecraft skin 'heals' itself |work=New Scientist |first=Will |last=Knight |date=2006-01-23 |accessdate=2008-02-11}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links|commons=Category:Spacecraft|v=no|q=no|b=no|s=no}}\n*[http://science.hq.nasa.gov/missions/phase.html NASA: Space Science Spacecraft Missions]\n*[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/SpacecraftQuery.jsp NSSDC Master Catalog Spacecraft Query Form]\n*[http://www.planet-surveyor.com/content-cat-1.html Early History of Spacecraft]\n*[http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/ Basics of Spaceflight tutorial from JPL/Caltech]\n*[http://ismuseum.org/ International Spaceflight Museum]\n\n{{Spaceflight}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Astronautics]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft| ]]\n[[Category:Pressure vessels]]"}]}}}}
