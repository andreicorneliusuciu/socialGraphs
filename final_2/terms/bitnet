BITNET links originally ran at 9600 [[baud]]. The BITNET [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]]s were eventually ported to non-IBM [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] [[operating system]]s, and became particularly widely implemented under [[VAX/VMS]], in addition to DECnet.\n\nBITNET featured [[email]] and [[LISTSERV]] software, but predated the [[World Wide Web]], the common use of [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], and [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]]. Gateways for the lists made them available on [[Usenet]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Hura |first=Gurdeep |date=28 March 2001 |title=Data and Computer Communications: Networking and Internetworking |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BViV0PoH_voC&pg=PA779 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |page=779 |isbn=9780849309281}}</ref> BITNET also supported interactive transmission of files and messages to other users. A gateway service called [[TRICKLE]] enabled users to request files from Internet FTP servers in 64&nbsp;Kb [[Uuencoding|UUencoded]] chunks. The ''Interchat Relay Network'', popularly known as [[Bitnet Relay]], was the network's [[instant messaging]] feature.\n\nBITNET differed from the [[Internet]] in that it was a [[point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] \"[[store and forward]]\" network. That is, [[email]] messages and files were transmitted in their entirety from one server to the next until reaching their destination. From this perspective, BITNET was more like [[UUCP#UUCPNET and mapping|UUCPNET]].\n\nBITNET\u2019s first electronic magazine, VM/COM, began as a [[University of Maine]] newsletter and circulated broadly in early 1984.  Two email newsletters that began as Bitnet newsletters in the fall of 1987 are known to still be transmitting. They are the Electronic Air and SCUP Email News (formerly SCUP Bitnet News).\n\nBITNET's eligibility requirements limited exchange with commercial entities, including IBM itself, which made technical assistance and bug fixes difficult. This became a particular problem when trying to communicate on heterogeneous networks with graphical workstation vendors such as [[Silicon Graphics]].\n\n==Extent==\nAt its zenith around 1991, BITNET extended to almost 500 organizations and 3,000 nodes, all educational institutions. It spanned North America (in Canada it was known as [[NetNorth]]), Europe (as [[European Academic Research Network|EARN]]), Israel (as [[ISRAEARN]]),<ref>http://dhhumanist.org/Archives/Virginia/v04/1140.html</ref> India ([[VIDYANET]])<ref>http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/as-emails-turn-40-scientists-recall-india-arrival-277436</ref> and some [[Persian Gulf]] states (as [[GulfNet]]).  BITNET was also very popular in other parts of the world, especially in South America, where about 200 nodes were implemented and heavily used in the late 1980s and early 1990s. With the rapid growth of [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] systems and the Internet in the early 1990s, and the rapid abandonment of the base IBM mainframe platform for academic purposes, BITNET's popularity and use diminished quickly.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 1984, a [[text-based]] BITNET game called [[MAD (MUD)|MAD]] became the first global [[MUD|Multi-User Dungeon]] (MUD).  Players connected from the United States, Europe or Israel to a single server running in France.\n\nIn 1996, [[Corporation for Research and Educational Networking|CREN]] ended their support for BITNET.  The individual nodes were free to keep their phone lines up as long as they wished, but as nodes dropped out, the network splintered into parts that were inaccessible from each other. As of 2007, BITNET has essentially ceased operation. However, a successor, [[BITNET II]], which transmits information via the Internet using BITNET protocols, still has some users.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Christmas Tree EXEC]]\n* [[Id file]]\n* [[History of the Internet]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/85.841135 A Social History of Bitnet and Listserv, 1985\u20131991]\n* [http://livinginternet.com/u/ui_bitnet.htm Living Internet \u2013 BITNET]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091124043245/http://nethistory.dumbentia.com/ NetHistory \u2013 Archive of BITNET newsletters and stories] (from archive.org)\n\n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n[[Category:History of telecommunications]]\n[[Category:Wide area networks]]"}]}}}}
