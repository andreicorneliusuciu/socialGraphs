A page break causes a form feed to be sent to the printer during spooling of the document to the printer. Thus it is one of the elements that contributes to [[pagination]].\n\n==Form feed==\nForm feed is a page-breaking [[ASCII]] [[control character]]. It forces the [[computer printer|printer]] to eject the current [[page (paper)|page]] and to continue printing at the top of another. Often, it will also cause a [[carriage return]]. The form feed character code is defined as 12 (0xC in [[hexadecimal]]), and may be represented as control+L or <tt>^L</tt>. In a related use, control+L can be used to clear the screen in Unix shells such as [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]].  In the [[C programming language]] (and other languages derived from C), the form feed character is represented as [[escape character|<code>'\\f'</code>]]. [[Unicode]] also provides the character {{Unichar|21A1|DOWNWARDS TWO HEADED ARROW}} to represent form feed.<ref>{{cite web| title = Unicode| url = http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2190.pdf| accessdate = 2013-05-11}}</ref>\nThe form feed character is considered [[Whitespace character|whitespace]] by the [[C character classification]] function <code>isspace()</code>.\n\nForm feed is seldom used when programming with modern printers in modern operating environments like [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Unix]], [[Linux]] or [[macOS]]. Instead, form feeds are generated by having the printing program call a form feed [[Application programming interface|API]] function. For example, when printing using the [[.NET Framework]], the [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.drawing.printing.printpageeventargs.hasmorepages.aspx<code> PrintPageEventArgs.HasMorePages</code> property] is used to indicate a form feed is desired.\n\nThe form feed character is sometimes used in plain text files of source code as a delimiter for a page break, or as marker for sections of code. Some editors, in particular [[emacs]] and [[vi]], have built-in commands to page up/down on the form feed character. This convention is predominantly used in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] code, and is also seen in [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] source code.\n\nIn [[Usenet]], the form feed character is used by several newsreaders as a \"spoiler character\", causing them to automatically hide the following text until prompted, as a way to prevent [[spoiler (media)|spoiler]]s from being inadvertently revealed.<ref>[http://www.newsreaders.com/spoilers/spoilers.html Spoilers on newsreaders.com]</ref> The precise behavior depends on the client displaying the article: for example, [[Gnus]] displays \"Next page...\" in boldface, and switches to a second screen to display text after the form feed; [[slrn]] displays all non-space characters following the form feed as [[asterisk]]s; Dialog turns the font and background color red between form feeds; and [[XRN]] simply inserts blank lines to fill up the remainder of the article display area so the user must scroll down to reveal the spoiler. This use of the form feed character is not supported by all newsreaders, and is not standardized, although it has appeared in a draft of a Usenet Best Practices document by the IETF's USEFOR working group,<ref>[http://www.tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-usefor-useage-01 IETF USEFOR USEAGE Draft]</ref> as a feature that user agents should (but are not required to) support.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Carriage control tape]]\n*[[Newline]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.javascriptkit.com/dhtmltutors/pagebreak.shtml CSS page break]\n\n[[Category:Control characters]]"}]}}}}
