The horizontal axis measures time; the vertical, current or voltage.]]\n\n{{Electromagnetism |Network}}\n\n'''Alternating current''' ('''AC'''), is an [[electric current]] in which the flow of [[electric charge]] periodically reverses direction, whereas in [[direct current]] ('''DC''', also '''dc'''), the flow of electric charge is only in one direction. AC is the form in which [[electric power]] is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electric power that consumers typically use when they plug [[kitchen appliance]]s, televisions and electric lamps into a [[wall socket]]. A common example of DC power is a [[battery (electricity)|battery cell]] in a [[flashlight]]. The abbreviations ''AC'' and ''DC'' are often used to mean simply ''alternating'' and ''direct'', as when they modify ''[[Electric current|current]]'' or ''[[voltage]]''.<ref>{{cite book| title = Basic Electronics & Linear Circuits| author = N.

In certain applications, different waveforms are used, such as [[Triangle wave|triangular]] or [[square wave]]s. [[Audio frequency|Audio]] and [[radio frequency|radio]] signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current. These types of alternating current carry information encoded (or [[Modulation|modulated]]) onto the AC signal, such as sound (audio) or images (video). These currents typically alternate at higher frequencies than those used in power transmission.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Transmission, distribution, and domestic power supply==\n\n{{Main|Electric power transmission|Electric power distribution}}\n\nElectric power is distributed as alternating current because AC voltage may be increased or decreased with a [[transformer]]. This allows the power to be transmitted through [[power line]]s efficiently at high voltage, which reduces the power lost as heat due to [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of the wire, and transformed to a lower, safer, voltage for use. Use of a higher [[voltage]] leads to significantly more efficient transmission of power. The power losses (<math>P_{\\rm L}</math>) in a conductor are a product of the square of the current (I) and the [[electrical resistance|resistance]] (R) of the conductor, described by the formula\n:<math> P_{\\rm L} = I^2 R \\, .</math>\nThis means that when transmitting a fixed power on a given wire, if the current is halved (i.e. the voltage is doubled), the power loss will be four times less.\n\nThe power transmitted is equal to the product of the current and the voltage (assuming no phase difference); that is,\n:<math>P_{\\rm T} = IV \\, .</math>\nConsequently, power transmitted at a higher voltage requires less loss-producing current than for the same power at a lower voltage. Power is often transmitted at hundreds of kilovolts, and transformed to 100\u2013240 volts for domestic use.\n\n[[File:Highvoltagetransmissionlines.jpg|thumb|right|265px|High voltage transmission lines deliver power from [[electric generation]] plants over long distances using alternating current. These lines are located in eastern [[Utah]].]]\n\nHigh voltages have disadvantages, the main one being the increased insulation required, and generally increased difficulty in their safe handling. In a [[power plant]], power is generated at a convenient voltage for the design of a [[Electric generator|generator]], and then stepped up to a high voltage for transmission. Near the loads, the transmission voltage is stepped down to the voltages used by equipment. Consumer voltages vary depending on the country and size of load, but generally motors and lighting are built to use up to a few hundred volts between phases. The voltage delivered to equipment such as lighting and motor loads is standardized, with an allowable range of voltage over which equipment is expected to operate. Standard power utilization voltages and percentage tolerance vary in the different [[mains power systems]] found in the world. [[High-voltage direct current|High-voltage direct-current]] (HVDC) electric power transmission systems have become more viable as technology has provided efficient means of changing the voltage of DC power. HVDC systems, however, tend to be more expensive and less efficient over shorter distances than transformers.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Transmission with high voltage direct current was not feasible in the early days of [[electric power transmission]], as there was then no economically viable way to step down the voltage of DC for end user applications such as lighting incandescent bulbs.\n\n[[Three-phase electric power|Three-phase]] electrical generation is very common. The simplest way is to use three separate coils in the generator [[stator]], physically offset by an angle of 120\u00b0 (one-third of a complete 360\u00b0 phase) to each other. Three current waveforms are produced that are equal in magnitude and 120\u00b0 [[out of phase]] to each other. If coils are added opposite to these (60\u00b0 spacing), they generate the same phases with reverse polarity and so can be simply wired together. In practice, higher \"pole orders\" are commonly used. For example, a 12-pole machine would have 36 coils (10\u00b0 spacing). The advantage is that lower rotational speeds can be used to generate the same frequency. For example, a 2-pole machine running at 3600&nbsp;rpm and a 12-pole machine running at 600&nbsp;rpm produce the same frequency; the lower speed is preferable for larger machines. If the load on a three-phase system is balanced equally among the phases, no current flows through the [[neutral point]]. Even in the worst-case unbalanced (linear) load, the neutral current will not exceed the highest of the phase currents. Non-linear loads (e.g., the switch-mode power supplies widely used) may require an oversized neutral bus and neutral conductor in the upstream distribution panel to handle [[Harmonic (electrical power)|harmonics]]. Harmonics can cause neutral conductor current levels to exceed that of one or all phase conductors.\n\nFor three-phase at utilization voltages a four-wire system is often used. When stepping down three-phase, a transformer with a Delta (3-wire) primary and a Star (4-wire, center-earthed) secondary is often used so there is no need for a neutral on the supply side. For smaller customers (just how small varies by country and age of the installation) only a [[single-phase electric power|single phase]] and neutral, or two phases and neutral, are taken to the property. For larger installations all three phases and neutral are taken to the main distribution panel. From the three-phase main panel, both single and three-phase circuits may lead off. [[Split-phase electric power|Three-wire single-phase]] systems, with a single center-tapped transformer giving two live conductors, is a common distribution scheme for residential and small commercial buildings in North America. This arrangement is sometimes incorrectly referred to as \"two phase\". A similar method is used for a different reason on construction sites in the UK. Small power tools and lighting are supposed to be supplied by a local center-tapped transformer with a voltage of 55 V between each power conductor and earth. This significantly reduces the risk of [[electric shock]] in the event that one of the live conductors becomes exposed through an equipment fault whilst still allowing a reasonable voltage of 110 V between the two conductors for running the tools.\n\nA [[Ground and neutral|third wire]], called the bond (or earth) wire, is often connected between non-current-carrying metal enclosures and earth ground. This conductor provides protection from electric shock due to accidental contact of circuit conductors with the metal chassis of portable appliances and tools. Bonding all non-current-carrying metal parts into one complete system ensures there is always a low [[electrical impedance]] path to ground sufficient to carry any [[Fault (power engineering)|fault]] current for as long as it takes for the system to clear the fault. This low impedance path allows the maximum amount of fault current, causing the overcurrent protection device (breakers, fuses) to trip or burn out as quickly as possible, bringing the electrical system to a safe state. All bond wires are bonded to ground at the main service panel, as is the Neutral/Identified conductor if present.\n\n==AC power supply frequencies==\n{{further|Mains electricity by country}}\n\nThe [[Utility frequency|frequency of the electrical system]] varies by country and sometimes within a country; most electric power is generated at either 50 or 60&nbsp;[[hertz]]. Some countries have a mixture of 50&nbsp;Hz and 60&nbsp;Hz supplies, notably [[Electricity sector in Japan#Transmission|electricity power transmission in Japan]]. A low frequency eases the design of electric motors, particularly for hoisting, crushing and rolling applications, and commutator-type [[traction motor]]s for applications such as [[railway]]s. However, low frequency also causes noticeable flicker in [[arc lamp]]s and [[incandescent light bulb]]s. The use of lower frequencies also provided the advantage of lower impedance losses, which are proportional to frequency. The original Niagara Falls generators were built to produce 25&nbsp;Hz power, as a compromise between low frequency for traction and heavy induction motors, while still allowing incandescent lighting to operate (although with noticeable flicker). Most of the 25&nbsp;Hz residential and commercial customers for Niagara Falls power were converted to 60&nbsp;Hz by the late 1950s, although some{{which|date=December 2011}} 25&nbsp;Hz industrial customers still existed as of the start of the 21st century. 16.7&nbsp;Hz power (formerly 16 2/3&nbsp;Hz) is still used in some European rail systems, such as in [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Switzerland]]. Off-shore, military, textile industry, marine, aircraft, and spacecraft applications sometimes use 400&nbsp;Hz, for benefits of reduced weight of apparatus or higher motor speeds. Computer [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] systems are often powered by 415&nbsp;Hz, using customer-supplied 35 or 70 kVA motor-generator sets.<ref>The largest capacity first-generation Amdahl (470V) required ''two'' 70 kVA M-G sets</ref> Smaller mainframes may have an internal 415&nbsp;Hz M-G set. In any case, the input to the M-G set is the local customary voltage and frequency, variously 200 (Japan), 208, 240 (North America), 380, 400 or 415 (Europe) volts, and variously 50 or 60&nbsp;Hz.\n\n==Effects at high frequencies==\n\n{{main|Skin effect}}\n\n[[File:22. \u0422\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438\u043d \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440.ogg|thumb|left|280px|A [[Tesla coil]] producing high-frequency current that is harmless to humans, but  lights a [[neon tube]] when brought near it (experiment performed by Prof. Oliver Zajkov at the Physics Institute at the [[Ss. Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje]], Macedonia)]]\n\nA direct current flows uniformly throughout the cross-section of a uniform wire. An alternating current of any frequency is forced away from the wire's center, toward its outer surface. This is because the acceleration of an [[electric charge]] in an alternating current produces [[electromagnetic waves|waves]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] that cancel the propagation of electricity toward the center of materials with high [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]]. This phenomenon is called [[skin effect]]. At very high frequencies the current no longer flows ''in'' the wire, but effectively flows ''on'' the surface of the wire, within a thickness of a few [[skin depth]]s. The skin depth is the thickness at which the current density is reduced by 63%. Even at relatively low frequencies used for power transmission (50\u201360&nbsp;Hz), non-uniform distribution of current still occurs in sufficiently thick [[Electrical conductor|conductor]]s. For example, the skin depth of a copper conductor is approximately 8.57&nbsp;mm at 60&nbsp;Hz, so high current conductors are usually hollow to reduce their mass and cost. Since the current tends to flow in the periphery of conductors, the effective cross-section of the conductor is reduced. This increases the effective AC [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of the conductor, since resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. The AC resistance often is many times higher than the DC resistance, causing a much higher energy loss due to [[ohmic heating]] (also called I<sup>2</sup>R loss).\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Techniques for reducing AC resistance===\nFor low to medium frequencies, conductors can be divided into stranded wires, each insulated from one other, and the relative positions of individual strands specially arranged within the conductor bundle. Wire constructed using this technique is called [[Litz wire]]. This measure helps to partially mitigate skin effect by forcing more equal current throughout the total cross section of the stranded conductors. Litz wire is used for making [[Quality factor|high-Q]] [[inductor]]s, reducing losses in flexible conductors carrying very high currents at lower frequencies, and in the windings of devices carrying higher [[radio frequency]] current (up to hundreds of kilohertz), such as switch-mode [[power supply|power supplies]] and [[radio frequency]] [[transformer]]s.\n\n===Techniques for reducing radiation loss===\nAs written above, an alternating current is made of [[electric charge]] under periodic [[acceleration]], which causes [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] of [[electromagnetic waves]]. Energy that is radiated is lost. Depending on the frequency, different techniques are used to minimize the loss due to radiation.\n\n====Twisted pairs====\nAt frequencies up to about 1&nbsp;GHz, pairs of wires are twisted together in a cable, forming a [[twisted pair]]. This reduces losses from [[electromagnetic radiation]] and [[inductive coupling]]. A twisted pair must be used with a balanced signalling system, so that the two wires carry equal but opposite currents. Each wire in a twisted pair radiates a signal, but it is effectively cancelled by radiation from the other wire, resulting in almost no radiation loss.\n\n====Coaxial cables====\n[[Coaxial cable]]s are commonly used at [[Audio frequency|audio frequencies]] and above for convenience. A coaxial cable has a conductive wire inside a conductive tube, separated by a [[dielectric]] layer. The current flowing on the inner conductor is equal and opposite to the current flowing on the inner surface of the tube. The electromagnetic field is thus completely contained within the tube, and (ideally) no energy is lost to radiation or coupling outside the tube. Coaxial cables have acceptably small losses for frequencies up to about 5&nbsp;GHz. For [[microwave]] frequencies greater than 5&nbsp;GHz, the losses (due mainly to the electrical resistance of the central conductor) become too large, making [[Waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguides]] a more efficient medium for transmitting energy. Coaxial cables with an air rather than solid dielectric are preferred as they transmit power with lower loss.\n\n====Waveguides====\n[[Waveguide (electromagnetism)|Waveguides]] are similar to coax cables, as both consist of tubes, with the biggest difference being that the waveguide has no inner conductor. Waveguides can have any arbitrary cross section, but rectangular cross sections are the most common. Because waveguides do not have an inner conductor to carry a return current, waveguides cannot deliver energy by means of an [[electric current]], but rather by means of a ''guided'' [[electromagnetic field]]. Although [[Current density|surface currents]] do flow on the inner walls of the waveguides, those surface currents do not carry power. Power is carried by the guided electromagnetic fields. The surface currents are set up by the guided electromagnetic fields and have the effect of keeping the fields inside the waveguide and preventing leakage of the fields to the space outside the waveguide. Waveguides have dimensions comparable to the [[wavelength]] of the alternating current to be transmitted, so they are only feasible at microwave frequencies. In addition to this mechanical feasibility, [[electrical resistance]] of the non-ideal metals forming the walls of the waveguide cause [[dissipation]] of power (surface currents flowing on lossy [[electrical conductor|conductors]] dissipate power). At higher frequencies, the power lost to this dissipation becomes unacceptably large.\n\n====Fibre optics====\nAt frequencies greater than 200&nbsp;GHz, waveguide dimensions become impractically small, and the [[ohmic heating|ohmic losses]] in the waveguide walls become large. Instead, [[fibre optics]], which are a form of dielectric waveguides, can be used. For such frequencies, the concepts of voltages and currents are no longer used.\n\n==Mathematics of AC voltages==<!--This section is linked from [[Vacuum cleaner]]-->\n[[File:Sinusspannung.svg|right|thumb||mini|A sinusoidal alternating voltage.\n<br />\n1 = peak, also amplitude,<br />\n2 = peak-to-peak,\n<br />\n3 = effective value,\n<br />\n4 = Period]]\n[[File:Sine wave 2.svg|right|thumb|A sine wave, over one cycle (360\u00b0). The dashed line represents the [[root mean square]] (RMS) value at about 0.707]]\nAlternating currents are accompanied (or caused) by alternating voltages. An AC voltage ''v'' can be described mathematically as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of time by the following equation:\n\n:<math>v(t)=V_\\mathrm{peak}\\cdot\\sin(\\omega t)</math>,\n\nwhere\n*<math>\\displaystyle V_{\\rm peak}</math> is the peak voltage (unit: [[volt]]),\n*<math>\\displaystyle\\omega</math> is the [[angular frequency]] (unit: [[radians per second]])\n**The angular frequency is related to the physical frequency, <math>\\displaystyle f</math> (unit = [[hertz]]), which represents the number of cycles per second, by the equation <math>\\displaystyle\\omega = 2\\pi f</math>.\n*<math>\\displaystyle t</math> is the time (unit: [[second]]).\n\nThe peak-to-peak value of an AC voltage is defined as the difference between its positive peak and its negative peak. Since the maximum value of <math>\\sin(x)</math> is +1 and the minimum value is \u22121, an AC voltage swings between <math>+V_{\\rm peak}</math> and <math>-V_{\\rm peak}</math>. The peak-to-peak voltage, usually written as <math>V_{\\rm pp}</math> or <math>V_{\\rm P-P}</math>, is therefore <math>V_{\\rm peak} - (-V_{\\rm peak}) = 2 V_{\\rm peak}</math>.\n\n===Power===\n{{main|AC power}}\n\nThe relationship between voltage and the power delivered is\n\n:<math>p(t) = \\frac{v^2(t)}{R}</math> where <math>R</math> represents a load resistance.\n\nRather than using instantaneous power, <math>p(t)</math>, it is more practical to use a time averaged power (where the averaging is performed over any integer number of cycles). Therefore, AC voltage is often expressed as a [[root mean square]] (RMS) value, written as <math>V_{\\rm rms}</math>, because\n:<math>P_{\\rm time~averaged} = \\frac{{V^2}_{\\rm rms}}{R}.</math>\n\n;Power oscillation\n:<math>v(t)=V_\\mathrm{peak}\\sin(\\omega t)</math>\n:<math>i(t)=\\frac{v(t)}{R}=\\frac{V_\\mathrm{peak}}{R}\\sin(\\omega t)</math>\n:<math>P(t)=v(t)\\ i(t)=\\frac{(V_\\mathrm{peak})^2}{R} \\sin^2(\\omega t)</math>\n\n===Root mean square voltage{{anchor|Root mean square}}===\n{{further|RMS amplitude}}\n{{broader|Root mean square voltage}}\nBelow it is assumed an [[AC waveform]] (with no [[DC component]]).\n\n*For an arbitrary periodic waveform <math>v(t)</math> of period <math>T</math>:\n:<math>V_\\mathrm{rms}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^{T}{[v(t)]^2 dt}}.</math>\n\n* For a sinusoidal voltage:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nV_\\mathrm{rms} &=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^{T}[{V_{pk}\\sin( \\omega t+\\phi)]^2 dt}}\\\\\n               &=V_{pk}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2T} \\int_0^{T}[{1-\\cos(2\\omega t+2\\phi)] dt}}\\\\\n               &=V_{pk}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2T} \\int_0^{T}{ dt}}\\\\\n               &=\\frac{V_{pk}}{\\sqrt {2}}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n: where the [[trigonometric identity]] <math>\\sin^2 x = \\frac {1 - \\cos 2x}{2}</math> has been used and the factor <math>\\sqrt{2}</math> is called the [[crest factor]], which varies for different waveforms.\n\n*For a [[triangle wave]]form centered about zero\n:<math>V_\\mathrm{rms}=\\frac{V_\\mathrm{peak}}{\\sqrt{3}}.</math>\n\n*For a [[square wave]]form centered about zero\n:<math>\\displaystyle V_\\mathrm{rms}=V_\\mathrm{peak}.</math>\n\n===Example===\nTo illustrate these concepts, consider a 230&nbsp;V AC [[Mains power systems|mains]] supply used in [[Mains power systems#Table of mains voltages and frequencies|many countries]] around the world. It is so called because its [[root mean square]] value is 230&nbsp;V. This means that the time-averaged power delivered is equivalent to the power delivered by a DC voltage of 230 V. To determine the peak voltage (amplitude), we can rearrange the above equation to:\n\n:<math>V_\\mathrm{peak}=\\sqrt{2}\\ V_\\mathrm{rms}.</math>\n\nFor 230&nbsp;V AC, the peak voltage <math>V_\\mathrm{peak}</math> is therefore <math>230 V\\times\\sqrt{2}</math>, which is about 325&nbsp;V.\n\n==Information transmission==\nAlternating current is used to transmit [[information]], as in the cases of [[telephone]] and [[cable television]]. Information signals are carried over a wide range of AC frequencies. [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] telephone signals have a frequency of about 3 kilohertz, close to the [[baseband]] audio frequency. Cable television and other cable-transmitted information currents may alternate at frequencies of tens to thousands of megahertz. These frequencies are similar to the electromagnetic wave frequencies often used to transmit the same types of information [[wireless|over the air]].\n\n==History==\nThe first [[alternator]] to produce alternating current was a [[Dynamo|dynamo electric generator]] based on [[Michael Faraday]]'s principles constructed by the French instrument maker [[Hippolyte Pixii]] in 1832.<ref>[http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/java/pixiimachine/index.html Pixii Machine invented by Hippolyte Pixii, National High Magnetic Field Laboratory]</ref> Pixii later added a [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] to his device to produce the (then) more commonly used direct current. The earliest recorded practical application of alternating current is by [[Guillaume Duchenne]], inventor and developer of [[electrotherapy]]. In 1855, he announced that AC was superior to [[direct current]] for electrotherapeutic triggering of muscle contractions.<ref>Licht, Sidney Herman., \"History of Electrotherapy\", in Therapeutic Electricity and Ultraviolet Radiation, 2nd ed., ed. Sidney Licht, New Haven: E. Licht, 1967, Pp. 1-70.</ref> Alternating current technology had first developed in Europe due to the work of [[Guillaume Duchenne]] (1850s), the Hungarian [[Ganz Works]] company (1870s), and in the 1880s: [[Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti]], [[Lucien Gaulard]], and [[Galileo Ferraris]].\n\nIn 1876, Russian engineer [[Pavel Yablochkov]] invented a lighting system based on a set of induction coils where the primary windings were connected to a source of AC.

Direct-current systems could be directly used with storage batteries, providing valuable load-leveling and backup power during interruptions of generator operation. Direct-current generators could be easily paralleled, allowing economical operation by using smaller machines during periods of light load and improving reliability. At the introduction of Edison's system, no practical [[AC motor]] was available. Edison had invented a meter to allow customers to be billed for energy proportional to consumption, but this meter worked only with direct current. The principal drawback of direct-current distribution was that customer loads, distribution and generation were all at the same voltage. Generally, it was uneconomical to use a high voltage for transmission and reduce it for customer uses. Even with the Edison 3-wire system (placing two 110-volt customer loads in series on a 220-volt supply), the high cost of conductors required generation to be close to customer loads, otherwise losses made the system uneconomical to operate.\n\n===Transformers===\nAlternating current systems can use [[transformer]]s to change voltage from low to high level and back, allowing generation and consumption at low voltages but transmission, possibly over great distances, at high voltage, with savings in the cost of conductors and energy losses. A bipolar open-core [[Transformer|power transformer]] developed by [[Lucien Gaulard]] and [[John Dixon Gibbs]] was demonstrated in London in 1881, and attracted the interest of [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]]. They also exhibited the invention in [[Turin]] in 1884. However these early induction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient at transferring power to [[Electrical load|loads]]. Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil.<ref name=FJU1889>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoftransfo00upperich|last=Uppenborn|first=F.

Using pairs of coils wound on a common iron core, his design, called an [[induction coil]], was an early (1885) [[transformer]]. Stanley also worked on engineering and adapting European designs such as the Gaulard and Gibbs transformer for US entrepreneur [[George Westinghouse]] who started building AC systems in 1886. The spread of Westinghouse and other AC systems triggered a push back in late 1887 by Edison (a proponent of direct current) who attempted to discredit alternating current as too dangerous in a public campaign called the \"[[War of Currents]]\". In 1888 alternating current systems gained further viability with introduction of a functional [[AC motor]], something these systems had lacked up till then. The design, an [[induction motor]], was independently invented by [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Nikola Tesla]] (with Tesla's design being licensed by Westinghouse in the US). This design was further developed into the modern practical [[three-phase]] form by [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] and [[Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown]].<ref name=\"books.google.com\">[[Arnold Heertje]], Mark Perlman [https://books.google.com/books?id=qQMOPjUgWHsC&pg=PA138&lpg=PA138&dq=tesla+motors+sparked+induction+motor&source=bl&ots=d0d_SjX8YX&sig=sA8LhTkGdQtgByBPD_ZDalCBwQA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=XoVSUPnfJo7A9gSwiICYCQ&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=tesla%20motors%20sparked%20induction%20motor&f=false Evolving Technology and Market Structure: Studies in Schumpeterian Economics], page 138</ref>\n\nThe [[Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant]] (spring of 1891) and the original [[Niagara Falls]] [[Adams Power Plant]] (August 25, 1895) were among the first hydroelectric AC-power plants. The first commercial power plant in the United States using [[three-phase]] alternating current was the hydroelectric [[Mill Creek No. 1 Hydroelectric Plant]] near [[Redlands, California]], in 1893 designed by Almirian Decker. Decker's design incorporated 10,000 V three-phase transmission and established the standards for the complete system of generation, transmission and motors used today. The [[Jaruga Hydroelectric Power Plant]] in Croatia was set in operation on 28 August 1895. The two [[Electric generator|generators]] (42&nbsp;Hz, 550&nbsp;kW each) and the transformers were produced and installed by the Hungarian company [[Ganz]]. The transmission line from the power plant to the City of [[\u0160ibenik]] was {{convert|11.5|km|sp=us}} long on wooden towers, and the municipal distribution grid 3000 V/110 V included six transforming stations. Alternating current circuit theory developed rapidly in the latter part of the 19th and early 20th century. Notable contributors to the theoretical basis of alternating current calculations include [[Charles Steinmetz]], [[Oliver Heaviside]], and many others.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=f5FqsDPVQ2MC&pg=PA1229&dq=theoretical++alternating+current++Oliver+Heaviside&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bifsUOmuLKio0AHXtIGoBg&ved=0CFUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=theoretical%20%20alternating%20current%20%20Oliver%20Heaviside&f=false I.
