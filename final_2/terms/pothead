They are used mostly for [[service drop]]s for commercial and industrial buildings.   For lower voltages such as those used for residential service drops, another weather seal called a [[weatherhead]] is used.\n\nThe device consists of a molded plastic housing that attaches to the end of an [[electrical conduit]] that carries the underground cables up the utility pole to the crossarm.  Multiple [[bushing (electrical)|bushing]] [[electrical insulator|insulators]] project from the plastic body, each ending at an electrical terminal.  Each overhead wire is connected to a bushing terminal from which the current passes through a rod down the center of the bushing to the interior of the housing, where it is connected to a wire from the conduit.  Thus the device allows the overhead conductors to pass into the conduit while serving as a seal to keep out water.   The purpose of the bushings, which have corrugations moulded into their surfaces, is to provide enough [[creepage distance]] along their surface to prevent leakage current from the high voltage terminal from flowing to the grounded metal conduit.    \n\n==Superseded==\nPothead was once defined in [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) Std 48-1962 \"Standards for Potheads.\"  This standard was superseded by IEEE Std 48-1975 \"IEEE Standard Test Procedures and Requirements for High-Voltage Alternating-Current Cable Terminations,\" and \"pothead\" was dropped from usage.  The current standard is IEEE Std 48-2009.<ref>http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/48-2009.html</ref>\n\nWhat was once called a pothead is now called a \"Class I High-Voltage Cable Termination,\" which must meet these requirements:\n\n# Electrical stress control\n# Insulation between the conductors and ground\n# An environmental seal\n\n\n\n<div style=\"page-break-inside:avoid\">\n{{clear}}\n\n==Alternatives==\nHigh voltage terminations conforming to IEEE Std 48-1990 and not requiring potting compound are illustrated below:\n\n{{gallery\n|width=210\n|lines=3\n|File:PowerlineOverheadUnderground60kV.JPG|Transition of a 60kv powerline between overhead and underground\n|File:PowerlineOverheadUnderground4160V.JPG|Transition of a 4160 Volt powerline from overhead to underground\n|File:SingleConductorPotHead.jpg|Pothead for one phase\n}}\n\n</div>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Weatherhead]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Electrical components]]\n[[Category:Electric power distribution]]\n\n\n{{electric-power-stub}}"}]}}}}
