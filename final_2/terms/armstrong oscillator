The patent does not mention Meissner; the patent was issued to Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Drahtlose Telegraphie [[Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung|mbH]] [Corporation for Wireless Telegraphy].</ref>) is an LC [[electronic oscillator]] circuit which uses an [[inductor]] and [[capacitor]] to generate an oscillation. It is the earliest oscillator circuit, invented by US engineer [[Edwin Armstrong]] in 1912 and independently by Austrian engineer [[Alexander Meissner]] in 1913, and was used in the first vacuum tube [[transmitter|radio transmitters]]. It is sometimes called a '''tickler oscillator'''  because its distinguishing feature is that the [[feedback]] signal needed to produce oscillations is [[inductive coupling|magnetically coupled]] into the tank inductor in the input circuit by a \"tickler coil\" ''(L2, right)'' in the output circuit. Assuming the coupling is weak, but sufficient to sustain oscillation, the oscillation frequency ''f'' is determined primarily by the tank circuit ''(L1 and C in the figure on the right)'' and is approximately given by \n\n:<math>f = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{LC}} \\,</math> \n\nThis circuit was widely used in the [[Regenerative circuit|regenerative radio receiver]], popular until the 1940s. In that application, the input radio frequency signal from the antenna is magnetically coupled into the tank circuit by an additional winding, and the feedback is reduced with an adjustable gain control in the feedback loop, so the circuit is just short of oscillation. The result is a narrow-band radio-frequency filter and amplifier. The non-linear characteristic of the transistor or tube also [[demodulation|demodulated]] the RF signal to produce the audio signal.<br> \n\nThe circuit diagram shown is a modern implementation, using a [[field-effect transistor]] as the amplifying element. Armstrong's original design used a triode [[vacuum tube]].\n\nNote that in the Meissner variant, the LC resonant (tank) circuit is exchanged with the feedback coil, i.e. in the output path (vacuum tube plate, field effect transistor drain, or bipolar transistor collector) of the amplifier (e.g. Grebennikov, Fig. 2.8).<ref>{{Citation |first=A. |last=Grebennikov |title=RF and Microwave Transistor Oscillator Design |publisher=Wiley |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-470-02535-2 |doi= }}</ref> Many publications, however, embrace both variants with either name.
