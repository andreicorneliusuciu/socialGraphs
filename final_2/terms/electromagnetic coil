Either an electric current is passed through the wire of the coil to generate a magnetic field,  or conversely an external ''time-varying'' magnetic field through the interior of the coil generates an [[Electromotive force|EMF]] ([[voltage]]) in the conductor.\n\nA current through any conductor creates a circular magnetic field around the conductor due to [[Ampere's circuital law|Ampere's law]].<ref name=\"Arun\">{{cite book   \n  | last = Arun\n  | first = P. \n  | title = Electronics\n  | publisher = Alpha Sciences International Ltd.\n  | year = 2006\n  | location = \n  | pages = 73\u201377\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HsavX0cnxTcC&pg=PA73\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 1842652176}}</ref>  The advantage of using the coil shape is that it increases the strength of magnetic field produced by a given current.  The magnetic fields generated by the separate turns of wire all pass through the center of the coil and add ([[Superposition principle|superpose]]) to produce a strong field there.<ref name=\"Arun\" />  The more turns of wire, the stronger the field produced.   Conversely, a ''changing'' external magnetic flux induces a voltage in a conductor such as a wire, due to [[Faraday's law of induction]].<ref name=\"Arun\" /><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lROa-MpIrucC&pg=PA129&dq=Faradays+law    Newnes 2002, p. 129]</ref>  The induced voltage can be increased by winding the wire into a coil, because the field lines intersect the circuit multiple times.<ref name=\"Arun\" />\n\nThe direction of the magnetic field produced by a coil can be determined by the [[right hand grip rule]].  If the fingers of the right hand are wrapped around the magnetic core of a coil in the direction of [[conventional current]] through the wire, the thumb will point in the direction the [[magnetic field line]]s  pass through the coil.  The end of a magnetic core from which the field lines emerge is defined to be the North pole.\n\nThere are many different types of coils used in electric and electronic equipment.\n\n==Windings and taps==\n[[File:Transformers.png|thumb|Diagram of typical transformer configurations]]\nThe wire or conductor which constitutes the coil is called the '''winding'''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9sW_knz5P0wC&pg=PA273 Stauffer 2005, p. 273]</ref>  The hole in the center of the coil is called the '''core''' area or ''magnetic axis''.<ref name=\"Amos\">{{cite book   \n  | last = Amos\n  | first = S W \n  |author2=Roger Amos\n  | title = Newnes Dictionary of Electronics \n  | publisher = Newnes \n  | year = 2002\n  | location = \n  | page = 191\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lROa-MpIrucC&pg=PA191&dq=magnetic+core\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 0080524052}}</ref>  Each loop of wire is called a  '''turn'''.<ref name=\"Laplante\" />  In windings in which the turns touch, the wire must be insulated with a coating of nonconductive [[insulation (electric)|insulation]] such as plastic or enamel to prevent the current from passing between the wire turns.   The winding is often wrapped around a ''coil form'' made of plastic or other material to hold it in place.<ref name=\"Laplante\" />  The ends of the wire are brought out and attached to an external circuit.  Windings may have additional electrical connections along their length; these are called '''taps'''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=soSsLATmZnkC&pg=PA633&dq=tap  Laplante 1999, p. 633]</ref>  A winding which has a single tap in the center of its length is called '''center-tapped'''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9sW_knz5P0wC&pg=PA29 Stauffer 2005, p. 29]</ref>\n\nCoils can have more than one winding, insulated electrically from each other.  When there are two or more windings around a common magnetic axis, the windings are said to be '''inductively coupled''' or '''magnetically coupled'''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lROa-MpIrucC&pg=PA167&dq=inductive+coupling    Newnes 2002, p. 167]</ref>  A time-varying current through one winding will create a time-varying magnetic field which passes through the other winding, which will induce a time-varying voltage in the other windings.  This is called a [[transformer]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lROa-MpIrucC&pg=PA326&dq=transformer    Newnes 2002, p. 326]</ref>\n\n==Magnetic core==\nMany electromagnetic coils have a [[magnetic core]], a piece of [[ferromagnetic]] material like [[iron]] in the center to increase the magnetic field.<ref name=\"Laplante1\">{{cite book   \n  | last = Laplante\n  | first = Phillip A. \n  | title = Comprehensive Dictionary of Electrical Engineering\n  | publisher = Springer\n  | year = 1998\n  | location = \n  | page = 143\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=soSsLATmZnkC&pg=PA143&dq=core\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 3540648356}}</ref>  The current through the coil magnetizes the iron, and the field of the magnetized material adds to the field produced by the wire.

A '''ferrite core coil''' is a variety of coil with a core made of [[ferrite core|ferrite]], a [[ferrimagnetic]] ceramic compound.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=soSsLATmZnkC&pg=PA243&dq=ferrite+core  Laplante 1999, p. 243]</ref>  Ferrite coils have lower losses at high frequencies.\n\nA coil without a ferromagnetic core is called an '''air-core coil'''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=soSsLATmZnkC&pg=PA19&dq=air+core  Laplante 1999, p. 19]</ref> This includes coils wound on plastic or other nonmagnetic forms, as well as coils which actually have empty air space inside their windings.\n\n==Types of coils==\nCoils can be classified by the [[frequency]] of the current they are designed to operate with:\n:*''Direct current'' or ''DC'' coils or electromagnets operate with a steady [[direct current]] in their windings \n:*''Audio-frequency'' or ''AF'' coils, inductors or transformers operate with [[alternating current]]s in the  [[audio frequency]] range, less than 20 kHz\n:*''Radio-frequency'' or ''RF'' coils, inductors or transformers operate with alternating currents in the [[radio frequency]] range, above 20 kHz\n\nCoils can be classified by their function:\n[[Image:Stator eines Universalmotor.JPG|thumb|[[Field coil]] electromagnet on the [[stator]] of an AC [[universal motor]]. ]]\n\n===Electromagnets===\n{{main|Electromagnet}}\nElectromagnets are coils that generate a [[magnetic field]] for some external use, often to exert a mechanical force on something.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lROa-MpIrucC&pg=PA113&dq=electromagnet    Newnes 2002, p. 113]</ref>  A few specific types:  \n:*[[Solenoid]] - an electromagnet in the form of a straight hollow helix of wire\n:*Motor and generator windings - iron core electromagnets on the [[rotor (electric)|rotor]] or [[stator]] of electric motors and generators which act on each other to either turn the shaft (motor) or generate an electric current (generator)\n:**[[Field winding]] - an iron-core coil which generates a steady magnetic field to act on the armature winding.\n:**[[Armature (electrical engineering)|Armature]] winding - an iron-core coil which is acted on by the magnetic field of the field winding to either create torque (motor) or induce a voltage to produce power (generator)\n:*[[Helmholtz coil]], [[Maxwell coil]] - air-core coils which serve to cancel an external magnetic field\n:*[[Degaussing]] coil - a coil used to demagnetize parts\n:*[[Voice coil]] - a coil used in a moving-coil [[loudspeaker]], suspended between the poles of a magnet.  When the [[audio signal]] is passed through the coil, it vibrates, moving the attached speaker cone to create sound waves.\n\n===Inductors===\n[[Image:Transmitter_tank_inductor.jpg|thumb|Tank inductor in a [[tuned circuit]] in a shortwave [[transmitter|radio transmitter]]]]\n{{main|Inductor}}\n[[Inductor]]s or reactors are coils which generate a magnetic field which interacts with the coil itself, to induce a back EMF which opposes changes in current through the coil.  Inductors are used as [[circuit element]]s in electrical circuits, to temporarily store energy or resist changes in current.  A few types:\n:*Tank coil - an inductor used in a [[tuned circuit]]\n:*[[Choke (electronics)|Choke]] - an inductor used to block high frequency AC while allowing through low frequency AC.\n:*[[Loading coil]] - an inductor used to add inductance to an antenna, to make it resonant, or to a cable to prevent distortion of signals.\n:*[[Variometer]] - an adjustable inductor consisting of two coils in series, an outer stationary coil and a second one inside it which can be rotated so their magnetic axes are in the same direction or opposed.\n:*[[Flyback transformer]] - Although called a transformer, this is actually an inductor which serves to store energy in [[switching power supply|switching power supplies]] and horizontal deflection circuits for  [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] televisions and monitors\n:*[[Saturable reactor]] - an iron-core inductor used to control AC power by varying the saturation of the core using a DC control voltage in an auxiliary winding.\n:*[[Electrical ballast|Inductive ballast]] - an inductor used in [[gas-discharge lamp]] circuits, such as [[fluorescent lamp]]s, to limit the current through the lamp.\n\n===Transformers===\n[[Image:Trafo-innenleben.jpg|thumb|Transformer]]\n{{main|Transformer}}\nA transformer is a device with two or more magnetically coupled windings (or sections of a single winding).  A time varying current in one coil (called the [[primary winding]]) generates a magnetic field which induces a voltage in the other coil (called the [[secondary winding]]). A few types: \n:*[[Distribution transformer]] - A transformer in an [[electric power grid]] which transforms the high voltage from the electric [[power line]] to the lower voltage used by utility customers.\n:*[[Autotransformer]] - a transformer with only one winding.  Different portions of the winding, accessed with taps, act as  primary and secondary windings of the transformer.  \n:*[[Toroidal transformer]] - the core is in the shape of a [[toroid]].  This is a commonly used shape as it decreases the leakage flux, resulting in less electromagnetic interference.\n:*[[Induction coil]] or [[trembler coil]] - an early transformer which uses a vibrating interrupter mechanism to break the primary current so it can operate off of DC current. \n:**[[Ignition coil]] - an induction coil used in [[internal combustion engine]]s to create a pulse of high voltage to fire the [[spark plug]] which initiates the fuel burning.\n:*[[Balun]] - a transformer which matches a [[balanced transmission line]] to an unbalanced one.\n:*[[Bifilar coil]] - a coil wound with two parallel, closely spaced strands. If AC currents are passed through it in the same direction, the [[magnetic flux]]es will add, but if equal currents in opposite directions pass through the windings the opposite fluxes will cancel, resulting in zero flux in the core.  So no voltage will be induced in a third winding on the core.    These are used in instruments and in devices like [[Ground Fault Interrupter]]s.  They are also used in low inductance wirewound resistors for use at RF frequencies.\n:*[[Audio transformer]] - A transformer used with [[audio signal]]s. They are used for [[impedance matching]].\n:**[[Hybrid coil]] - a specialized audio transformer with 3 windings used in [[telephony]] circuits to convert between [[two-wire circuit|two-wire]] and [[four-wire circuit]]s\n\n===Transducer coils===\n[[Image:Metal detecting in progress on a Time Team dig.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|The sensor coil of a [[metal detector]].]]\nThese are coils used to translate time-varying magnetic fields to electric signals, and vice versa.  A few types:\n:*Sensor or pickup coils - these are used to detect external time-varying magnetic fields \n:*[[Inductive sensor]] - a coil which senses when a magnet or iron object passes near it \n:*[[Recording head]] - a coil which is used to create a magnetic field to write data to a [[magnetic storage]] medium, such as [[magnetic tape]], or a [[hard disk]].  Conversely it is also used to read the data in the form of changing magnetic fields in the medium.\n:*[[Induction heating|Induction heating coil]] - an AC coil used to heat an object by inducing [[eddy current]]s in it, a process called [[induction heating]].\n:*[[Loop antenna]] - a coil which serves as a [[antenna (radio)|radio antenna]], to convert radio waves to electric currents. \n:*[[Rogowski coil]] - a toroidal coil used as an AC measuring device\n:*[[Pickup (music technology)|Musical instrument pickup]] - a coil used to produce the output [[audio signal]] in an [[electric guitar]] or [[electric bass]].\n:*[[Flux-gate magnetometer|Flux gate]] - a sensor coil used in a [[magnetometer]]\n:*[[Magnetic cartridge|Magnetic phonograph cartridge]] - a sensor in a [[record player]] that uses a coil to translate vibration of a needle to an audio signal in playing vinyl [[phonograph record]]s.\n\nThere are also types of coil which don't fit into these categories.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Querfurth, William, \"''Coil winding; a description of coil winding procedures, winding machines and associated equipment for the electronic industry''\" (2d ed.).
