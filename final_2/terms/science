In particular, it was the type of knowledge which people can communicate to each other and share. For example, knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and led to the development of complex abstract thought. This is shown by the construction of complex calendars, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, and buildings such as [[Giza pyramid complex|the Pyramids]].

He criticized the older type of study of physics as too purely speculative, and lacking in self-criticism. He was particularly concerned that some of the early physicists treated nature as if it could be assumed that it had no intelligent order, explaining things merely in terms of motion and matter. The study of human things had been the realm of mythology and tradition, however, so Socrates was executed as a heretic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Apol.+30&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170|title=Plato, Apology, section 30|last=|first=|date=1966|website=Perseus Digital Library|publisher=Tufts University|access-date=November 1, 2016}}</ref>{{rp| 30e}} [[Aristotle]] later created a less controversial systematic programme of Socratic philosophy which was [[teleological]] and human-centred. He rejected many of the conclusions of earlier scientists. For example, in his physics the sun goes around the earth, and many things have it as part of their nature that they are for humans. Each thing has a [[formal cause]] and [[final cause]] and a role in the rational cosmic order. Motion and change is described as the [[actualization]] of potentials already in things, according to what types of things they are. While the Socratics insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being (a study Aristotle divided into [[ethics]] and [[political philosophy]]), they did not argue for any other types of [[applied science]].\n\nAristotle maintained the sharp distinction between science and the practical knowledge of artisans, treating theoretical speculation as the highest type of human activity, practical thinking about good living as something less lofty, and the knowledge of artisans as something only suitable for the lower classes. In contrast to modern science, Aristotle's influential emphasis was upon the \"theoretical\" steps of [[deductive reasoning|deducing]] universal rules from raw data, and did not treat the gathering of experience and raw data as part of science itself.<ref group=nb>\"...&nbsp;[A] man knows a thing scientifically when he possesses a conviction arrived at in a certain way, and when the first principles on which that conviction rests are known to him with certainty\u2014for unless he is more certain of his first principles than of the conclusion drawn from them he will only possess the knowledge in question accidentally.\"&nbsp;\u2014 Aristotle, ''Nicomachean Ethics'' '''6''' (H.

He used Tycho Brahe's method of observation, which was to project the image of the sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture, instead of looking directly at the sun. He disagreed with Brahe's conclusion that total eclipses of the sun were impossible, because there were historical accounts of total eclipses. Instead he deduced that the size of the aperture controls the sharpness of the projected image (the larger the aperture, the more accurate the image&nbsp;\u2014 this fact is now fundamental for optical system design).

His theory of [[natural selection]] provided a natural explanation of how [[species]] originated, but this only gained wide acceptance a century later. [[John Dalton]] developed the idea of [[atom]]s. The laws of [[thermodynamics]] and the [[electromagnetic theory]] were also established in the 19th century, which raised new questions which could not easily be answered using Newton's framework. The phenomena that would allow the deconstruction of the [[atom]] were discovered in the last decade of the 19th century: the discovery of [[X-ray]]s inspired the discovery of [[radioactivity]]. In the next year came the discovery of the first subatomic particle, the [[electron]].\n[[File:Candle-light-animated.gif||thumb|left|upright=0.80|Combustion and chemical reactions were studied by [[Michael Faraday]] and reported in his lectures before the [[Royal Institution]]: ''[[The Chemical History of a Candle]]'', 1861]]\n\n=== 20th century and beyond ===\n[[File:CMS Higgs-event.jpg|thumb|upright=0.80|A simulated event in the CMS detector of the [[Large Hadron Collider]], featuring a possible appearance of the [[Higgs boson]]]]\n[[Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]] and the development of [[quantum mechanics]] led to the replacement of classical mechanics with a new physics which contains two parts that describe different types of events in nature.\n\nIn the first half of the century the development of [[artificial fertilizer]] made global human [[population growth]] possible. At the same time, the structure of the atom and its nucleus was discovered, leading to the release of \"[[atomic energy]]\" ([[nuclear power]]). In addition, the extensive use of scientific innovation stimulated by the wars of this century led to [[antibiotic]]s and increased life expectancy, revolutions in transportation ([[automobiles]] and [[aircraft]]), the development of [[ICBM]]s, a [[space race]], and a [[nuclear arms race]], all giving a widespread public appreciation of the importance of modern science.\n\nWidespread use of [[integrated circuits]] in the last quarter of the 20th century combined with [[communications satellite]]s led to a revolution in [[information technology]] and the rise of the global [[internet]] and [[mobile computing]], including [[smartphone]]s.\n\nMore recently, it has been argued that the ultimate purpose of science is to make sense of human beings and our nature.

One important function of mathematics in science is the role it plays in the expression of scientific models. Observing and collecting [[measurements]], as well as hypothesizing and predicting, often require extensive use of mathematics. For example, [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]], and [[calculus]] are all essential to [[physics]]. Virtually every branch of mathematics has applications in science, including \"pure\" areas such as [[number theory]] and [[topology]].\n\n[[Statistics|Statistical methods]], which are mathematical techniques for summarizing and analyzing data, allow scientists to assess the level of reliability and the range of variation in experimental results. Statistical analysis plays a fundamental role in many areas of both the natural sciences and social sciences.\n\n[[Computational science]] applies computing power to simulate real-world situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve. According to the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]], computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.siam.org/students/resources/report.php|title=SIAM: Graduate Education for Computational Science and Engineering|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|access-date=November 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhether mathematics itself is properly classified as science has been a matter of some debate. Some thinkers see mathematicians as scientists, regarding physical experiments as inessential or mathematical proofs as equivalent to experiments. Others do not see mathematics as a science because it does not require an experimental test of its theories and hypotheses. Mathematical [[theorem]]s and [[formula]]s are obtained by [[Mathematical logic|logical]] derivations which presume [[axiom]]atic systems, rather than the combination of [[Empirical evidence|empirical observation]] and logical reasoning that has come to be known as the [[scientific method]]. In general, mathematics is classified as [[formal science]], while natural and social sciences are classified as [[empirical]] sciences.<ref>{{cite book| title = Philosophy of Science: From Problem to Theory | author = Bunge, Mario Augusto | year = 1998 | publisher = Transaction Publishers | isbn = 0-7658-0413-1 | page = 24}}</ref>\n\n== Scientific community ==\n\n{{Main article|Scientific community}}\n\nThe scientific community is the group of all interacting scientists.

See [[:Template:Science and the public|Science and the public]] for related concepts.\n\nScience is represented by the 'S' in [[STEM fields]].\n\n== Philosophy of science ==\n{{See also|Philosophy of science}}\nWorking scientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method: (1) that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers; (2) that this objective reality is governed by natural laws; (3) that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation.<ref name=\"Heilbron 2003 p.vii\" /> Philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid.\n\nThe belief that scientific theories should and do represent [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] reality is known as [[Scientific realism|realism]].  It can be contrasted with [[Anti-realism#Anti-realism in science|anti-realism]], the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as [[electrons]].  One form of anti-realism is [[idealism]], the belief that the mind or [[consciousness]] is the most basic essence, and that each mind generates its own reality.<ref group=nb>This realization is the topic of [[intersubjective verifiability]], as recounted, for example, by [[Max Born]] (1949, 1965) [https://archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp/naturalphilosoph032159mbp_djvu.txt ''Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance''], who points out that all knowledge, including natural or social science, is also subjective. p. 162: \"Thus it dawned upon me that fundamentally everything is subjective, everything without exception. That was a shock.\"</ref>  In an idealistic [[world view]], what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds.\n\n[[File:Terasawa5.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.40|[[The Sand Reckoner]] is a work by Archimedes in which he sets out to determine an upper bound for the number of grains of sand that fit into the universe. In order to do this, he had to estimate the size of the universe according to the contemporary model, and invent a way to analyze extremely large numbers.]]\n\nThere are different schools of thought in philosophy of science. The most popular position is [[empiricism]],<ref name=Galileo1638 group=nb>In his investigation of the [[law of falling bodies]], [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] (1638) serves as example for scientific investigation: ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' \"A piece of wooden moulding or scantling, about 12 cubits long, half a cubit wide, and three finger-breadths thick, was taken; on its edge was cut a channel a little more than one finger in breadth; having made this groove very straight, smooth, and polished, and having lined it with parchment, also as smooth and polished as possible, we rolled along it a hard, smooth, and very round bronze ball. Having placed this board in a sloping position, by lifting one\nend some one or two cubits above the other, we rolled the ball, as I was just saying, along the channel, noting, in a manner presently to be described, the time required to make the descent. We . . . now rolled the ball only one-quarter the length of the channel; and having measured the time of its descent, we found it precisely one-half of the former. Next we tried other distances, comparing the time for the whole length with that for the half, or with that for two-thirds, or three-fourths, or indeed for any fraction; in such experiments, repeated many, many, times.\"  Galileo solved the problem of time measurement by weighing a jet of water collected during the descent of the bronze ball, as stated in his ''Two New Sciences''.</ref> which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations.<ref>\"...&nbsp;[T]he logical empiricists thought that the great aim of science was to discover and establish ''generalizations''.\"&nbsp;\u2014{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=41}}</ref> Empiricism generally encompasses [[inductivism]], a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories. This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using [[deductive logic]] only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being [[Bayesianism]]{{Sfn|Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=203}} and the [[hypothetico-deductive method]].<ref name=\"Godfrey-Smith,2003\">{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003}}</ref>{{rp|p236}}\n\nEmpiricism has stood in contrast to [[rationalism]], the position originally associated with [[Descartes]], which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation.<ref name=\"Godfrey-Smith,2003\" />{{rp|p20}} [[Critical rationalism]] is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by Austrian-British philosopher [[Karl Popper]]. Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it.<ref name=\"Godfrey-Smith,2003\" />{{rp|pp63\u20137}} Popper proposed replacing verifiability with [[falsifiability]] as the landmark of scientific theories, and replacing induction with [[Falsificationism|falsification]] as the empirical method.<ref name=\"Godfrey-Smith,2003\" />{{rp|p68}} Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism, [[trial and error]].<ref>Popper called this ''Conjecture and Refutation.'' {{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|pp=117\u20138}}</ref> It covers all products of the human mind, including science, mathematics, philosophy, and art.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Objective Knowledge|last=Popper|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1972|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAnother approach, [[instrumentalism]], colloquially termed \"shut up and multiply,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Shut_up_and_multiply|title=Shut up and multiply|last=|first=|date=September 13, 2015|website=LessWrong Wiki|publisher=|access-date=November 4, 2016}}</ref> emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena.<ref>{{cite book|title = The Rationality of Science | author = Newton-Smith, W.

Consequences, theoretical entities, and logical structure are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn't make a fuss about (see [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]]). Close to instrumentalism is [[constructive empiricism]], according to which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true.\n\n[[Paul Feyerabend]] advanced the idea of [[epistemological anarchism]], which holds that there are no useful and exception-free [[methodology|methodological rules]] governing the [[scientific progress|progress of science]] or the growth of [[knowledge]], and that the idea that science can or should operate according to universal and fixed rules is unrealistic, pernicious and detrimental to science itself.{{sfn|Feyerabend|1993}} Feyerabend advocates treating science as an [[ideology]] alongside others such as [[religion]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[mythology]], and considers the dominance of science in society [[authoritarian]] and unjustified. He also contended (along with [[Imre Lakatos]]){{discuss}} that the [[demarcation problem]] of distinguishing science from [[pseudoscience]] on objective grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according to fixed, universal rules.{{sfn|Feyerabend|1993}} Feyerabend also stated that science does not have evidence for its philosophical precepts, particularly the notion of [[Uniformitarianism|uniformity of law and process across time and space]].<ref>{{cite book| isbn = 0-86091-184-5 | title = Farewell To Reason| page = 100 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1987 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}</ref>\n\nFinally, another approach often cited in debates of [[scientific skepticism]] against controversial movements like \"[[creation science]]\" is [[methodological naturalism]]. Its main point is that a difference between natural and [[supernatural]] explanations should be made, and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations.<ref group=\"nb\">{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=151}} credits [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] (1969) \"Epistemology Naturalized\" ''Ontological Relativity and Other Essays'' New York: Columbia University Press, as well as [[John Dewey]], with the basic ideas of naturalism&nbsp;\u2014 [[Naturalized Epistemology]], but Godfrey-Smith diverges from Quine's position: according to Godfrey-Smith, \"A naturalist can think that science can contribute to ''answers'' to philosophical questions, without thinking that philosophical questions can be replaced by science questions.\".</ref> That the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not claim them to be wrong either. Instead, supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief [[Non-overlapping magisteria|outside the scope of science]]. Methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to [[empirical]] study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for [[observation|observable]] phenomena.<ref>{{cite journal|journal = The Review of Metaphysics|title = Casebeer, William D.

The use of [[measurement]]s, for example, is a practical approach to settle disputes in the community.\n\n[[John Ziman]] points out that [[intersubjective verifiability|intersubjective pattern recognition]] is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge.<ref>Ziman cites {{harvnb|Polanyi|1958}} chapter 12, as referenced in {{harvnb|Ziman|1978}}</ref>{{rp|p44}} Ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns to each other across centuries; he refers to this ability as \"perceptual consensibility.\"<ref name=Ziman1978>{{harvnb|Ziman|1978}}</ref>{{rp|p46}} He then makes consensibility, leading to consensus, the touchstone of reliable knowledge.<ref name=Ziman1978 />{{rp|p104}}\n\n=== Basic and applied research ===\n\n[[File:AlfedPalmersmokestacks.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Anthropogenic [[air pollution|pollution]] has an effect on the Earth's environment and [[climate]]]]\n\nAlthough some scientific research is [[applied research]] into specific problems, a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of [[basic research]]. This leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable. This point was made by Michael Faraday when allegedly in response to the question \"what is the ''use'' of basic research?\" he responded \"Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/91|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119113522/http://richarddawkins.net/articles/91|archivedate=January 19, 2012 |title=To Live at All Is Miracle Enough&nbsp;\u2014 Richard Dawkins |publisher=RichardDawkins.net |date=May 10, 2006 |accessdate=February 5, 2012}}</ref> For example, research into the effects of red light on the human eye's [[rod cells]] did not seem to have any practical purpose; eventually, the discovery that our [[night vision]] is not troubled by red light would lead [[search and rescue]] teams (among others) to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters.<ref name=\"Stanovich2007\" />{{rp|106\u2013110}}\nIn a nutshell, basic research is the search for knowledge, and applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge. Finally, even basic research can take unexpected turns, and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to [[Scientific method#Luck and science|harness luck]].\n\n=== Research in practice ===\nDue to the increasing complexity of information and specialization of scientists, most of the cutting-edge research today is done by well funded groups of scientists, rather than individuals.<ref name=simonton2013>{{cite journal|last=Simonton|first=Dean Keith|title=After Einstein: Scientific genius is extinct|journal=Nature|volume=493|issue=7434|pages=602\u2013602|doi=10.1038/493602a|year=2013}}</ref> D.K. Simonton notes that due to the breadth of very precise and far reaching tools already used by researchers today and the amount of research generated so far, creation of new disciplines or revolutions within a discipline may no longer be possible as it is unlikely that some phenomenon that merits its own discipline has been overlooked. Hybridizing of disciplines and finessing knowledge is, in his view, the future of science.<ref name=simonton2013 />\n\n=== Practical impacts of scientific research ===\nDiscoveries in fundamental science can be world-changing.
