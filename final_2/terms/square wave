The transition between minimum to maximum is instantaneous for an ideal square wave; this is not realizable in physical systems. Square waves are often encountered in [[electronics]] and [[signal processing]]. Its stochastic counterpart is a [[two-state trajectory]]. A similar but not necessarily symmetrical wave, with arbitrary durations at minimum and maximum, is called a [[pulse wave]] (of which the square wave is a special case).\n\nThe ratio of the high period to the total period of any rectangular wave is called the [[duty cycle]]. A true square wave has a 50% duty cycle - equal high and low periods. The average level of a rectangular wave is also given by the duty cycle, so by varying the on and off periods and then averaging it is possible to represent any value between the two limiting levels. This is the basis of [[pulse width modulation]].\n\n== Origin and uses ==\n\nSquare waves are universally encountered in [[Digital data|digital]] switching circuits and are naturally generated by binary (two-level) logic devices. They are used as timing references or \"[[clock signal]]s\", because their fast transitions are suitable for triggering [[synchronous logic]] circuits at precisely determined intervals. However, as the frequency-domain graph shows, square waves contain a wide range of harmonics; these can generate [[electromagnetic radiation]] or pulses of current that interfere with other nearby circuits, causing [[noise]] or errors. To avoid this problem in very sensitive circuits such as precision [[analog-to-digital converter]]s, [[sine wave]]s are used instead of square waves as timing references.\n\nIn musical terms, they are often described as sounding hollow, and are therefore used as the basis for [[wind instrument]] sounds created using [[subtractive synthesis]]. Additionally, the distortion effect used on [[electric guitar]]s clips the outermost regions of the waveform, causing it to increasingly resemble a square wave as more distortion is applied.\n\nSimple two-level [[Hans Rademacher|Rademacher]] functions are square waves.\n\n== Definitions ==\n\nThe square wave in mathematics has many definitions, which are equivalent except at the discontinuities:\n\nIt can be defined as simply the [[sign function]] of a periodic function, an example being a sinusoid:\n\n:<math>\n\\ x(t) = \\sgn(\\sin[t])\n</math>\n\n:<math>\n\\ v(t) = \\sgn(\\cos[t])\n</math>\n\nwhich will be 1 when the sinusoid is positive, &minus;1 when the sinusoid is negative, and 0 at the discontinuities. Any periodic function can substitute the sinusoid in this definition.\n\nA square wave can also be defined with respect to the [[Heaviside step function]] ''u''(''t'') or the [[rectangular function]] \u2293(''t''):\n\n:<math>\n\\ x(t) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\sqcap(t - nT) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\left( u \\left[t - nT + {1 \\over 2} \\right] - u \\left[t - nT - {1 \\over 2} \\right] \\right)  \n</math>\n\n''T'' is 2 for a 50% [[duty cycle]].  It can also be defined in a piecewise way:\n\n:<math>\n\\ x(t) = \\begin{cases} 1, & |t| < T_1 \\\\ 0, & T_1 < |t| \\leq {1 \\over 2}T \\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nwhen\n\n:<math>\n\\ x(t + T) = x(t)\n</math>\n\nIn terms of sine and cosecant with period ''p'' and amplitude ''a'':\n\n:<math>y(x) = a\\times\\csc\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{p}x\\right)\\left\\vert\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{p}x\\right)\\right\\vert</math>\n\nA square wave can also be generated using the floor function in the following two ways:\n\nDirectly:\n:<math>y(x) = m \\left(2\\lfloor \\nu x\\rfloor - \\lfloor 2 \\nu x\\rfloor + 1\\right)</math>\n\nAnd indirectly:\n:<math>y(x) = m \\left(-1\\right)^{\\lfloor \\nu x \\rfloor},</math>\n\nwhere m is the magnitude and \u03bd is the frequency.\n\nNote: y = atan sin x + acot sin x\n\n== Fourier analysis {{anchor|Fourier_Analysis}} ==\n[[File:SquareWaveFourierArrows.gif|thumb|300px|The six arrows represent the first six terms of the Fourier series of a square wave. The two circles at the bottom represent the exact square wave (blue) and its Fourier-series approximation (purple).]]\n[[File:Spectrum square oscillation.jpg|thumb|350px|right|(odd) harmonics of a square wave with 1000 Hz]]\n\nA square wave can be expressed as the limit case of an infinite series of sinusoidal waves, with fast convergence.\n\nUsing [[Fourier series|Fourier expansion]] with cycle frequency {{math|''f''}} over time {{math|''t''}}, we can represent an ideal square wave with an amplitude of 1 as an infinite series of the form\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx_{\\mathrm{square}}(t) & {} = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty {\\sin{\\left (2\\pi (2k-1) ft \\right )}\\over 2k - 1} \\\\ \n                       & {} = \\frac{4}{\\pi}\\left (\\sin(2\\pi ft) + {1\\over3}\\sin(6\\pi ft) + {1\\over5}\\sin(10\\pi ft) + \\cdots\\right )\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n{{Listen|filename=Additive_220Hz_Square_Wave.wav|title=Additive Square Demo|description=220Hz square wave created by harmonics added every second over sine wave.|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nThe ideal square wave contains only components of odd-integer [[harmonic]] frequencies (of the form {{math|2\u03c0(2''k''-1)''f''}}). [[Sawtooth wave]]s and real-world signals contain all integer harmonics.\n\nA curiosity of the convergence of the Fourier series representation of the square wave is the [[Gibbs phenomenon]]. [[Ringing artifacts]] in non-ideal square waves can be shown to be related to this phenomenon. The Gibbs phenomenon can be prevented by the use of [[sigma approximation|\u03c3-approximation]], which uses the [[Lanczos sigma factor]]s to help the sequence converge more smoothly.\n\nAn ideal mathematical square wave changes between the high and the low state instantaneously, and without under- or over-shooting.  This is impossible to achieve in physical systems, as it would require infinite [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]].\n\n[[File:Fourier_series_for_square_wave.gif|thumb|350px|right|Animation of the additive synthesis of a square wave with an increasing number of harmonics]]\n\nSquare-waves in physical systems have only finite bandwidth, and often exhibit [[Ringing (signal)|ringing]] effects similar to those of the Gibbs phenomenon, or ripple effects similar to those of the \u03c3-approximation.\n\nFor a reasonable approximation to the square-wave shape, at least the fundamental and third harmonic need to be present, with the fifth harmonic being desirable. These bandwidth requirements are important in digital electronics, where finite-bandwidth analog approximations to square-wave-like waveforms are used. (The ringing transients are an important electronic consideration here, as they may go beyond the electrical rating limits of a circuit or cause a badly positioned threshold to be crossed multiple times.)\n\n{{Listen|filename=Square wave 1000.ogg|title=Square wave sound sample|description=5 seconds of square wave at 1 kHz|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\n== Characteristics of imperfect square waves ==\n\nAs already mentioned, an ideal square wave has instantaneous transitions between the high and low levels. In practice, this is never achieved because of physical limitations of the system that generates the waveform. The times taken for the signal to rise from the low level to the high level and back again are called the ''[[rise time]]'' and the ''[[fall time]]'' respectively.\n\nIf the system is [[damping|overdamped]], then the waveform may never actually reach the theoretical high and low levels, and if the system is underdamped, it will oscillate about the high and low levels before settling down. In these cases, the rise and fall times are measured between specified intermediate levels, such as 5% and 95%, or 10% and 90%. The [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of a system is related to the transition times of the waveform; there are formulas allowing one to be determined approximately from the other.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of periodic functions]]\n* [[Rectangular function]]\n* [[Pulse wave]]\n* [[Sine wave]]\n* [[Triangle wave]]\n* [[Sawtooth wave]]\n* [[Waveform]]\n* [[Sound]]\n* [[Multivibrator]]\n* [[Ronchi ruling]], a square-wave stripe target used in imaging.\n* [[square function]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.electric1.es/armonicos/armonicosOC.html Flash applets] Square wave.\n\n[[Category:Waveforms]]\n[[Category:Fourier series]]"}]}}}}
