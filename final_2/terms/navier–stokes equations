These balance equations arise from applying [[Newton's second law]] to [[Fluid dynamics|fluid motion]], together with the assumption that the [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] in the fluid is the sum of a [[diffusion|diffusing]] [[viscosity|viscous]] term (proportional to the [[gradient]] of velocity) and a [[pressure]] term\u2014hence describing ''viscous flow''. The main difference between them and the simpler [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] for [[inviscid flow]] is that Navier\u2013Stokes equations also in the [[Froude number|Froude limit]] (no external field) are not [[conservation law|conservation equations]], but rather a [[dissipative system]], in the sense that they cannot be put into the quasilinear homogeneous form:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf y_t + \\mathbf A(\\mathbf y) \\mathbf y_x = 0.</math>\n\nNavier\u2013Stokes equations are useful because they describe the physics of many phenomena of [[scientific]] and [[engineering]] interest. They may be used to [[model (abstract)|model]] the weather, [[ocean current]]s, water [[flow conditioning|flow in a pipe]] and air flow around a [[airfoil|wing]]. The Navier\u2013Stokes equations in their full and simplified forms help with the design of aircraft and cars, the study of blood flow, the design of power stations, the analysis of pollution, and many other things. Coupled with [[Maxwell's equations]] they can be used to model and study [[magnetohydrodynamics]].\n\nThe Navier\u2013Stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense. Somewhat surprisingly, given their wide range of practical uses, it has not yet been proven that in three dimensions solutions always [[Existence theorem|exist]], or that if they do exist, then they are smooth, i.e. they do not contain any [[Singularity (mathematics)|mathematical singularity]]. These are called the [[Navier\u2013Stokes existence and smoothness]] problems. The [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] has called this one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems|seven most important open problems in mathematics]] and has offered a [[US$]]1,000,000 prize for a solution or a counterexample.<ref>\n{{Citation\n| url = http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems\n| title = Millennium Prize Problems\n| publisher = Clay Mathematics Institute\n| accessdate = 2014-01-14\n}}</ref>\n\n==Flow velocity==\nThe solution of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations is a [[flow velocity]]. It is a field, since it is defined at every point in a region of space and an interval of time. Once the velocity field is calculated, other quantities of interest, such as [[pressure]] or [[temperature]], may be found. This is different from what one normally sees in [[classical mechanics]], where solutions are typically trajectories of position of a [[particle]] or deflection of a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]]. Studying velocity instead of position makes more sense for a fluid; however for visualization purposes one can compute various [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|trajectories]].\n\n==General continuum equations==\n{{Main|Derivation of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations}}\n{{see also|Cauchy momentum equation#Conservation form}}\n\nThe Navier\u2013Stokes momentum equation can be derived as a particular form of the [[Cauchy momentum equation]].\nIn an [[inertial frame of reference]], the conservation form of the equations of [[continuum (measurement)|continuum]] motion is:<ref>Batchelor (1967) pp. 137 & 142.</ref>\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent=:\n|title='''Cauchy momentum equation''' ''(conservation form)''\n|equation=<math>\n\\frac {\\partial}{\\partial t} (\\rho \\mathbf{u}) + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u} \\otimes \\mathbf{u} + p \\mathbf{I}) = \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol \\tau + \\rho \\mathbf{g}\n</math>\n|cellpadding\n|border\n|border colour = #50C878\n|background colour = #ECFCF4\n}}\n\nwhere\n: {{mvar|\u03c1}} is the density,\n: {{math|'''u'''}} is the flow velocity,\n: {{math|\u2207}} is the [[del]] operator.\n: {{mvar|p}} is the [[pressure]]\n: {{math|'''I'''}} is the [[identity matrix]]\n: {{math|'''\u03c4'''}} is the [[Cauchy stress tensor#Stress deviator tensor|deviatoric stress tensor]], which has order two,\n: {{math|'''g'''}} represents [[body force|body acceleration]]s (per unit mass) acting on the continuum, for example [[gravity]], [[inertial acceleration]]s, [[electric field]] acceleration, and so on.\n: {{math|\u2297}} is the [[outer product]]: {{math|'''u''' \u2297 '''v''' {{=}} '''u''' \u00d7 '''v'''<sup>T</sup>}}\n\nThe left side of the equation describes acceleration, and may be composed of time-dependent, convective, and hydrostatic effects (also the effects of non-inertial coordinates if present). The right side of the equation is in effect a summation of body forces (such as gravity) and divergence of deviatoric stress.\n\nIn the Eulerian forms it is apparent that the assumption of no deviatoric stress brings Cauchy equations to the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]].\n\nAll non-relativistic balance equations, such as the Navier\u2013Stokes equations, can be derived by beginning with the Cauchy equations and specifying the stress tensor through a [[constitutive relation]]. By expressing the shear tensor in terms of [[viscosity]] and fluid [[Shear velocity|velocity]], and assuming constant density and viscosity, the Cauchy equations will lead to the Navier\u2013Stokes equations.\n\nThe [[incompressible flow|incompressible case]] is simpler than the compressible one so for didactical purpose it should be presented before. However, the compressible case is the most general framework of Navier\u2013Stokes equations so where not specified, Navier\u2013Stokes equations are intended to be ''compressible'' Navier\u2013Stokes equations.\n\n===Convective acceleration===\n{{see also|Cauchy momentum equation#Convective acceleration}}\n[[Image:ConvectiveAcceleration vectorized.svg|thumb|An example of convection. Though the flow may be steady (time-independent), the fluid decelerates as it moves down the diverging duct (assuming incompressible or subsonic compressible flow), hence there is an acceleration happening over position.]]\n\nA significant feature of Cauchy equation and consequently all other continuum equations (including Euler and Navier\u2013Stokes) is the presence of convective acceleration: the effect of time-independent acceleration of a flow with respect to space. While individual fluid particles indeed experience time-dependent acceleration, the convective acceleration of the flow field is a spatial effect, one example being fluid speeding up in a nozzle.\n\n==Incompressible flow==\nThe incompressible momentum Navier\u2013Stokes equation results from the following assumptions on the Cauchy stress tensor:<ref name=Batchelor_142_148>Batchelor (1967) pp. 142\u2013148.</ref>\n\n*the stress is '''[[Galilean invariance|Galileian invariant]]''': it does not depend directly on the flow velocity, but only on spatial derivatives of the flow velocity. So the stress variable is the tensor gradient {{math|\u2207'''u'''}}.\n*the fluid is assumed to be [[isotropic]], as with gases and simple liquids, and consequently {{math|'''V'''}} is an isotropic tensor; furthermore, since the deviatoric stress tensor can be expressed in terms of the [[dynamic viscosity]] {{mvar|\u03bc}}:\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent=::\n|title='''Stokes' stress [[constitutive equation]]''' ''(expression used for incompressible elastic solids)''\n|equation=:<math>\\boldsymbol \\tau = 2 \\mu \\boldsymbol \\varepsilon</math>\n|cellpadding\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F5FFFA\n}}\n\n:where\n\n::<math>\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\mathbf{\\nabla u} + \\mathbf{\\nabla u}^\\mathrm{T} \\right)</math>\n\n:is the rate-of-[[strain tensor]].

Any equation expliciting one of these [[transport coefficient]] in the [[conservative variable]]s is called an [[equation of state]].<ref name=\"Batchelor 1967 p. 165\">Batchelor (1967) p. 165.</ref>\n\nThe divergence of the deviatoric stress is given by:\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol \\tau = 2 \\mu \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol \\varepsilon = \\mu \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\nabla\\mathbf{u} + \\left( \\nabla\\mathbf{u} \\right)^\\mathrm{T} \\right) = \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}</math>\n\nIncompressibility rules out density and pressure waves like sound or [[shock wave]]s, so this simplification is not useful if these phenomena are of interest. The incompressible flow assumption typically holds well with all fluids at low [[Mach number]]s (say up to about Mach 0.3), such as for modelling air winds at normal temperatures.<ref name=\"Ach\">See Acheson (1990).</ref> For incompressible (uniform density \u03c1<sub>0</sub>) flows the following identity holds:\n\n:<math>\\frac 1 {\\rho_0} \\nabla p = \\nabla \\left(\\frac p {\\rho_0} \\right) \\equiv \\nabla w</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|w}} is the specific (with the sense of ''per unit mass'') [[thermodynamic work]], the internal source term.

This implies that \u2013 for a Newtonian fluid \u2013 viscosity operates as a ''diffusion of momentum'', in much the same way as the [[heat conduction]]. In fact neglecting the convection term, incompressible Navier\u2013Stokes equations lead to a vector [[diffusion equation]] (namely [[Stokes flow|Stokes equations]]), but in general the convection term is present, so incompressible Navier\u2013Stokes equations belong to the class of [[convection-diffusion equation]]s.\n\nIn the usual case of an external field being a [[conservative field]]:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf g = - \\nabla \\phi </math>\n\nby defining the [[hydraulic head]]:\n\n:<math>h \\equiv w + \\phi </math>\n\none can finally condense the whole source in one term, arriving to the incompressible Navier\u2013Stokes equation with conservative external field:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} - \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} = - \\nabla h.</math>\n\nThe incompressible Navier\u2013Stokes equations with conservative external field is the '''fundamental equation of [[hydraulics]]'''. The domain for these equations is commonly a 3 or less [[Euclidean space]], for which an [[orthogonal coordinate]] reference frame is usually set to explicit the system of scalar partial derivative equations to be solved. In 3D orthogonal coordinate systems are 3: [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]], [[Cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical]], and [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical]]. Expressing the Navier\u2013Stokes vector equation in Cartesian coordinates is quite straightforward and not much influenced by the number of dimensions of the euclidean space employed, and this is the case also for the first-order terms (like the variation and convection ones) also in non-cartesian orthogonal coordinate systems. But for the higher order terms (the two coming from the divergence of the deviatoric stress that distinguish Navier\u2013Stokes equations from Euler equations) some [[tensor calculus]] is required for deducing an expression in non-cartesian orthogonal coordinate systems.\n\nThe incompressible Navier\u2013Stokes equation is composite, the sum of two orthogonal equations,\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} &= \\Pi^S\\left(-(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u} + \\nu\\nabla^2\\mathbf{u}\\right) + \\mathbf{f}^S \\\\\n\\rho^{-1}\\nabla p &= \\Pi^I\\left(-(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u} + \\nu\\nabla^2\\mathbf{u}\\right) + \\mathbf{f}^I\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|\u03a0<sup>''S''</sup>}} and {{math|\u03a0<sup>''I''</sup>}} are solenoidal and irrotational projection operators satisfying {{math|\u03a0<sup>''S''</sup> + \u03a0<sup>''I''</sup> {{=}} 1}} and {{math|'''f'''<sup>''S''</sup>}} and {{math|'''f'''<sup>''I''</sup>}} are the non-conservative and conservative parts of the body force. This result follows from the [[Helmholtz decomposition|Helmholtz Theorem]] (also known as the fundamental theorem of vector calculus). The first equation is a pressureless governing equation for the velocity, while the second equation for the pressure is a functional of the velocity and is related to the pressure Poisson equation.\n\nThe explicit functional form of the projection operator in 3D is found from the Helmholtz Theorem:\n\n:<math>\\Pi^S\\,\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\nabla\\times\\int \\frac{\\nabla^\\prime\\times\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{r}')}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|} d V', \\quad \\Pi^I = 1-\\Pi^S</math>\n\nwith a similar structure in 2D. Thus the governing equation is an [[integro-differential equation]] similar to [[Coulomb law|Coulomb]] and [[Biot-Savart law]], not convenient for numerical computation.\n\nAn equivalent weak or variational form of the equation, proved to produce the same velocity solution as the Navier\u2013Stokes equation,<ref>\n{{citation\n | last = Temam | first = Roger\n | author-link = Roger Temam\n | title = Navier\u2013Stokes Equations, Theory and Numerical Analysis\n | pages = 107\u2013112\n | year = 2001 | publisher = AMS Chelsea\n}}</ref> is given by,\n:<math>\\left(\\mathbf{w},\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t}\\right) = -\\left(\\mathbf{w}, \\left(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla\\right)\\mathbf{u}\\right) - \\nu \\left(\\nabla\\mathbf{w}: \\nabla\\mathbf{u}\\right) + \\left(\\mathbf{w}, \\mathbf{f}^S\\right)</math>\n\nfor divergence-free test functions {{math|'''w'''}} satisfying appropriate boundary conditions. Here, the projections are accomplished by the orthogonality of the solenoidal and irrotational function spaces. The discrete form of this is eminently suited to finite element computation of divergence-free flow, as we shall see in the next section. There one will be able to address the question \"How does one specify pressure-driven (Poiseuille) problems with a pressureless governing equation?\".\n\nThe absence of pressure forces from the governing velocity equation demonstrates that the equation is not a dynamic one, but rather a kinematic equation where the divergence-free condition serves the role of a conservation equation. This all would seem to refute the frequent statements that the incompressible pressure enforces the divergence-free condition.\n\n===Discrete velocity===\nWith partitioning of the problem domain and defining [[basis function]]s on the partitioned domain, the discrete form of the governing equation is,\n:<math>\\left(\\mathbf{w}_i, \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{u}_j}{\\partial t}\\right) = -\\left(\\mathbf{w}_i, (\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{u}_j\\right) - \\nu(\\nabla\\mathbf{w}_i: \\nabla\\mathbf{u}_j) + \\left(\\mathbf{w}_i, \\mathbf{f}^S\\right).</math>\n\nIt is desirable to choose basis functions which reflect the essential feature of incompressible flow \u2013 the elements must be divergence-free. While the velocity is the variable of interest, the existence of the stream function or vector potential is necessary by the Helmholtz Theorem. Further, to determine fluid flow in the absence of a pressure gradient, one can specify the difference of stream function values across a 2D channel, or the line integral of the tangential component of the vector potential around the channel in 3D, the flow being given by [[Stokes' Theorem]]. Discussion will be restricted to 2D in the following.\n\nWe further restrict discussion to continuous Hermite finite elements which have at least first-derivative degrees-of-freedom. With this, one can draw a large number of candidate triangular and rectangular elements from the [[Bending of plates|plate-bending]] literature. These elements have derivatives as components of the gradient. In 2D, the gradient and curl of a scalar are clearly orthogonal, given by the expressions,\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\nabla\\phi &= \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x},\\,\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}\\right)^\\mathrm{T}, \\\\\n\\nabla\\times\\phi &= \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y},\\,-\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}\\right)^\\mathrm{T}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAdopting continuous plate-bending elements, interchanging the derivative degrees-of-freedom and changing the sign of the appropriate one gives many families of stream function elements.\n\nTaking the curl of the scalar stream function elements gives divergence-free velocity elements.<ref>\n{{Citation\n | last = Holdeman | first = J.

The stream function is constant on no-flow surfaces, with no-slip velocity conditions on surfaces.\nStream function differences across open channels determine the flow. No boundary conditions are necessary on open boundaries, though consistent values may be used with some problems. These are all Dirichlet conditions.\n\nThe algebraic equations to be solved are simple to set up, but of course are [[#Nonlinearity|non-linear]], requiring iteration of the linearized equations.\n\nSimilar considerations apply to three-dimensions, but extension from 2D is not immediate because of the vector nature of the potential, and there exists no simple relation between the gradient and the curl as was the case in 2D.\n\n===Pressure recovery===\nRecovering pressure from the velocity field is easy.

Any conforming scalar finite element may be used. However, the pressure gradient field may also be of interest. In this case one can use scalar Hermite elements for the pressure. For the test/weight functions {{math|'''g'''<sub>''i''</sub>}} one would choose the irrotational vector elements obtained from the gradient of the pressure element.\n\n==Compressible flow==\nThe Navier\u2013Stokes equations result from the following assumptions on the stress tensor:<ref name=\"Batchelor_142_148\"/>\n\n*the stress is '''[[Galilean invariance|Galileian invariant]]''': it does not depend directly on the flow velocity, but only on spatial derivatives of the flow velocity.

To fully describe fluid flow, more information is needed, how much depending on the assumptions made. This additional information may include boundary data ([[no-slip condition|no-slip]], [[capillary surface]], etc.), conservation of mass, balance of energy, and/or an [[equation of state]].\n\n===Continuity equation===\n{{main|Continuity equation}}\n\nRegardless of the flow assumptions, a statement of the [[conservation of mass]] is generally necessary. This is achieved through the mass [[continuity equation]], given in its most general form as:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u}) = 0</math>\n\nor, using the [[substantive derivative]]:\n:<math>\\frac{D\\rho}{Dt} + \\rho (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) = 0.</math>\n\nIn the example below we can assume to have a [[Newtonian fluid]] as well as having {{mvar|\u03c1}} and {{mvar|\u03bc}} both be constant.\n\nRecall that mass continuity is simply the summation of the rate of mass in and the rate of mass out.\n: rate of mass accumulated = rate of mass in \u2212 rate of mass out\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\Delta x \\Delta y \\Delta z \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} &= \\Delta y \\Delta z \\left (\\rho U_x|_x - \\rho U_x|_{x + \\Delta x} \\right) + \\Delta x \\Delta z \\left(\\rho U_y|_y - \\rho U_y|_{y + \\Delta y} \\right) + \\Delta x\\Delta y \\left (\\rho U_z|_z - \\rho U_z|_{z + \\Delta z} \\right ) \\\\[8pt]\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} &= \\frac{\\rho U_x|_x - \\rho U_x|_{x + \\Delta x}}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{\\rho U_y|_y- \\rho U_y|_{y + \\Delta y}}{\\Delta y} + \\frac{\\rho U_z|_z - \\rho U_z|_{z + \\Delta z}}{\\Delta z} \\\\[6pt]\n&= \\rho \\left (\\frac{U_x|_x - U_x|_{x + \\Delta x}}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{U_y|_y - U_y|_{y + \\Delta y}}{\\Delta y} + \\frac{U_z|_z - U_z|_{z + \\Delta z}}{\\Delta z} \\right ) \\\\[6pt]\n&= -\\rho \\left (\\frac{\\partial U_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial U_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial U_z}{\\partial z} \\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSince there is no change in density {{mvar|\u03c1}} over time, {{mvar|{{sfrac|\u2202''\u03c1''|\u2202''t''}} {{=}} 0}}, we have:\n\n:<math> 0 = -\\rho \\left (\\frac{\\partial U_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial U_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial U_z}{\\partial z} \\right)</math>\n\nRecall that {{mvar|\u03c1}} is a constant thus proving the divergence theorem above.\n\n==Stream function for 2D equations==\nTaking the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of the Navier\u2013Stokes equation results in the elimination of pressure. This is especially easy to see if 2D Cartesian flow is assumed (like in the degenerate 3D case with {{math|''u<sub>z</sub>'' {{=}} 0}} and no dependence of anything on {{mvar|z}}), where the equations reduce to:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n \\rho \\left(\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial t} + u_x \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} + u_y \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y}\\right)\n &= -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\mu \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u_x}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_x}{\\partial y^2}\\right) + \\rho g_x \\\\\n \\rho \\left(\\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial t} + u_x \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial x} + u_y \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y}\\right)\n &= -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} + \\mu \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u_y}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_y}{\\partial y^2}\\right) + \\rho g_y.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nDifferentiating the first with respect to {{mvar|y}}, the second with respect to {{mvar|x}} and subtracting the resulting equations will eliminate pressure and any [[conservative force]].

We can also express this compactly using the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian determinant]]:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\nabla^2 \\psi\\right) + \\frac{\\partial\\left(\\psi, \\nabla^2\\psi \\right)}{\\partial(y,x)} = \\nu \\nabla^4 \\psi.</math>\n\nThis single equation together with appropriate boundary conditions describes 2D fluid flow, taking only kinematic viscosity as a parameter. Note that the equation for [[creeping flow]] results when the left side is assumed zero.\n\nIn [[axisymmetric]] flow another stream function formulation, called the [[Stokes stream function]], can be used to describe the velocity components of an incompressible flow with one [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] function.\n\nThe incompressible Navier\u2013Stokes equation is a [[differential algebraic equation]], having the inconvenient feature that there is no explicit mechanism for advancing the pressure in time. Consequently, much effort has been expended to eliminate the pressure from all or part of the computational process. The stream function formulation eliminates the pressure but only in two dimensions and at the expense of introducing higher derivatives and elimination of the velocity, which is the primary variable of interest.\n\n==Properties==\n===Nonlinearity===\n\nThe Navier\u2013Stokes equations are [[nonlinear]] [[partial differential equations]] in the general case and so remain in almost every real situation.<ref>Fluid Mechanics (Schaum's Series), M. Potter, D.C. Wiggert, Schaum's Outlines, McGraw-Hill (USA), 2008, ISBN 978-0-07-148781-8</ref><ref>Vectors, Tensors, and the basic Equations of Fluid Mechanics, R. Aris, Dover Publications, 1989, ISBN 0-486-66110-5</ref> In some cases, such as one-dimensional flow and [[Stokes flow]] (or creeping flow), the equations can be simplified to linear equations. The nonlinearity makes most problems difficult or impossible to solve and is the main contributor to the [[turbulence]] that the equations model.\n\nThe nonlinearity is due to [[convective]] acceleration, which is an acceleration associated with the change in velocity over position. Hence, any convective flow, whether turbulent or not, will involve nonlinearity. An example of convective but [[laminar flow|laminar]] (nonturbulent) flow would be the passage of a viscous fluid (for example, oil) through a small converging [[nozzle]]. Such flows, whether exactly solvable or not, can often be thoroughly studied and understood.<ref>McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), C.B. Parker, 1994, ISBN 0-07-051400-3</ref>\n\n===Turbulence===\n\n[[Turbulence]] is the time-dependent [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] behavior seen in many fluid flows. It is generally believed that it is due to the [[inertia]] of the fluid as a whole: the culmination of time-dependent and convective acceleration; hence flows where inertial effects are small tend to be laminar (the [[Reynolds number]] quantifies how much the flow is affected by inertia). It is believed, though not known with certainty, that the Navier\u2013Stokes equations describe turbulence properly.<ref>Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), R.G. Lerner, G.L. Trigg, VHC publishers, 1991, ISBN (Verlagsgesellschaft) 3-527-26954-1, ISBN (VHC Inc.) 0-89573-752-3</ref>\n\nThe numerical solution of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations for turbulent flow is extremely difficult, and due to the significantly different mixing-length scales that are involved in turbulent flow, the stable solution of this requires such a fine mesh resolution that the computational time becomes significantly infeasible for calculation or [[direct numerical simulation]]. Attempts to solve turbulent flow using a laminar solver typically result in a time-unsteady solution, which fails to converge appropriately. To counter this, time-averaged equations such as the [[Reynolds-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes equations]] (RANS), supplemented with turbulence models, are used in practical [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) applications when modeling turbulent flows. Some models include the [[Spalart\u2013Allmaras turbulence model|Spalart\u2013Allmaras]], [[k-omega turbulence model|{{mvar|k}}\u2013{{mvar|\u03c9}}]], [[turbulence kinetic energy|{{mvar|k}}\u2013{{mvar|\u03b5}}]], and SST models, which add a variety of additional equations to bring closure to the RANS equations. [[Large eddy simulation]] (LES) can also be used to solve these equations numerically. This approach is computationally more expensive\u2014in time and in computer memory\u2014than RANS, but produces better results because it explicitly resolves the larger turbulent scales.\n\n===Applicability===\n{{further|Discretization of Navier\u2013Stokes equations}}\nTogether with supplemental equations (for example, conservation of mass) and well formulated boundary conditions, the Navier\u2013Stokes equations seem to model fluid motion accurately; even turbulent flows seem (on average) to agree with real world observations.\n\nThe Navier\u2013Stokes equations assume that the fluid being studied is a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]] (it is infinitely divisible and not composed of particles such as atoms or molecules), and is not moving at [[Special relativity#Relativistic mechanics|relativistic velocities]]. At very small scales or under extreme conditions, real fluids made out of discrete molecules will produce results different from the continuous fluids modeled by the Navier\u2013Stokes equations. Depending on the [[Knudsen number]] of the problem, the [[Boltzmann equation]] may be a suitable replacement; failing that, one may find the techniques of [[statistical mechanics]] sufficient or have to resort to [[molecular dynamics]].\n\nAnother limitation is simply the complicated nature of the equations. Time-tested formulations exist for common fluid families, but the application of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations to less common families tends to result in very complicated formulations and often to open research problems. For this reason, these equations are usually rewritten for [[Newtonian fluid]]s where the viscosity model is [[linear]]; truly general models for the flow of other kinds of fluids (such as blood) do not exist.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Application to specific problems==\nThe Navier\u2013Stokes equations, even when written explicitly for specific fluids, are rather generic in nature and their proper application to specific problems can be very diverse. This is partly because there is an enormous variety of problems that may be modeled, ranging from as simple as the distribution of static pressure to as complicated as [[multiphase flow]] driven by [[surface tension]].\n\nGenerally, application to specific problems begins with some flow assumptions and initial/boundary condition formulation, this may be followed by [[Scale analysis (mathematics)|scale analysis]] to further simplify the problem.\n\n[[Image:NSConvection vectorial.svg|thumb|400px|Visualization of '''(a)''' parallel flow and '''(b)''' radial flow.]]\n\n===Parallel flow===\nAssume steady, parallel, one dimensional, non-convective pressure-driven flow between parallel plates, the resulting scaled (dimensionless) [[boundary value problem]] is:\n:<math>\\frac{d^2 u}{d y^2} = -1; \\quad u(0) = u(1) = 0.</math>\n\nThe boundary condition is the [[no slip condition]]. This problem is easily solved for the flow field:\n:<math>u(y) = \\frac{y - y^2}{2}.</math>\n\nFrom this point onward more quantities of interest can be easily obtained, such as viscous drag force or net flow rate.\n\n===Radial flow===\nDifficulties may arise when the problem becomes slightly more complicated. A seemingly modest twist on the parallel flow above would be the ''radial'' flow between parallel plates; this involves convection and thus non-linearity. The velocity field may be represented by a function {{math|''f''(''z'')}} that must satisfy:\n:<math>\\frac{d^2 f}{d z^2} + R f^2 = -1; \\quad f(-1) = f(1) = 0.</math>\n\nThis [[ordinary differential equation]] is what is obtained when the Navier\u2013Stokes equations are written and the flow assumptions applied (additionally, the pressure gradient is solved for). The [[nonlinear]] term makes this a very difficult problem to solve analytically (a lengthy [[Implicit function|implicit]] solution may be found which involves [[elliptic integrals]] and [[Cubic formula|roots of cubic polynomials]]). Issues with the actual existence of solutions arise for {{math|''R'' > 1.41}} (approximately; this is not [[square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]]), the parameter R being the Reynolds number with appropriately chosen scales.<ref name=\"TM Shah\">{{cite web|last=Shah |first=Tasneem Mohammad|title=Analysis of the multigrid method|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989STIN...9123418S|publisher=Published by Dr. TM Shah; republished by The Smithsonian/NASA Astrophysics Data System|accessdate=8 January 2013|year=1972}}</ref> This is an example of flow assumptions losing their applicability, and an example of the difficulty in \"high\" Reynolds number flows.<ref name=\"TM Shah\"/>\n\n==Exact solutions of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations==\nSome exact solutions to the Navier\u2013Stokes equations exist.
