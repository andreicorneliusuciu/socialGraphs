The \"electromagnetic spectrum\" ''of an object'' has a different meaning, and is instead the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular object.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe electromagnetic spectrum extends from below the low frequencies used for modern [[radio]] communication to [[gamma radiation]] at the short-[[wavelength]] (high-frequency) end, thereby covering wavelengths from thousands of [[kilometer]]s down to a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] of the size of an [[atom]].  [[Visible light]] lies toward the shorter end, with wavelengths from 400 to 700 [[nanometre]]s.  The limit for long wavelengths is the size of the [[universe]] itself, while it is thought that the short wavelength limit is in the vicinity of the [[Planck length]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Basic Electronics Engineering |author1=Bakshi, U.

The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] recognized that light traveled in straight lines and studied some of its properties, including [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[refraction]]. The study of light continued, and during the 16th and 17th centuries conflicting theories regarded light as either a wave or a particle.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe first discovery of [[electromagnetic radiation]] other than visible light came in 1800, when [[William Herschel]] discovered [[infrared]] radiation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Herschel Discovers Infrared Light|url=http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/classroom_activities/herschel_bio.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225094516/http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/classroom_activities/herschel_bio.html|archivedate=2012-02-25|work=Cool Cosmos Classroom activities|accessdate=4 March 2013|quote=He directed sunlight through a glass prism to create a spectrum [\u2026] and then measured the temperature of each colour. [\u2026] He found that the temperatures of the colors increased from the violet to the red part of the spectrum. [\u2026] Herschel decided to measure the temperature just ''beyond'' the red of the spectrum in a region where no sunlight was visible. To his surprise, he found that this region had the highest temperature of all.}}</ref>  He was studying the temperature of different colors by moving a thermometer through light split by a prism. He noticed that the highest temperature was beyond red. He theorized that this temperature change was due to \"calorific rays\" that were a type of light ray that could not be seen.\n\nThe next year, [[Johann Ritter]], working at the other end of the spectrum, noticed what he called \"chemical rays\" (invisible light rays that induced certain chemical reactions). These behaved similarly to visible violet light rays, but were beyond them in the spectrum.<ref>{{cite web|last=Davidson|first=Michael W.|title=Johann Wilhelm Ritter (1776\u20131810)|url=http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/optics/timeline/people/ritter.html|publisher=The Florida State University|accessdate=5 March 2013|quote=Ritter [\u2026] hypothesized that there must also be invisible radiation beyond the violet end of the spectrum and commenced experiments to confirm his speculation. He began working with silver chloride, a substance decomposed by light, measuring the speed at which different colors of light broke it down. [\u2026] Ritter [\u2026] demonstrated that the fastest rate of decomposition occurred with radiation that could not be seen, but that existed in a region beyond the violet. Ritter initially referred to the new type of radiation as chemical rays, but the title of ultraviolet radiation eventually became the preferred term.}}</ref>  They were later renamed [[ultraviolet]] radiation.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation had been first linked to electromagnetism in 1845, when [[Michael Faraday]] noticed that the polarization of light traveling through a transparent material responded to a [[magnetic field]] (see [[Faraday effect]]). During the 1860s [[James Clerk Maxwell|James Maxwell]] developed four partial differential [[Maxwell's equations|equations]] for the [[electromagnetic field]]. Two of these equations predicted the possibility of, and behavior of, waves in the field. Analyzing the speed of these theoretical waves, Maxwell realized that they must travel at a speed that was about the known [[speed of light]]. This startling coincidence in value led Maxwell to make the inference that light itself is a type of electromagnetic wave.\n\n[[Maxwell's equations]] predicted an infinite number of frequencies of [[electromagnetic waves]], all traveling at the speed of light. This was the first indication of the existence of the entire electromagnetic [[spectrum]].\n\nMaxwell's predicted waves included waves at very low frequencies compared to infrared, which in theory might be created by oscillating charges in an ordinary electrical circuit of a certain type. Attempting to prove Maxwell's equations and detect such low frequency electromagnetic radiation, in 1886 the physicist [[Heinrich Hertz]] built an apparatus to generate and detect what are now called [[radio wave]]s. Hertz found the waves and was able to infer (by measuring their wavelength and multiplying it by their frequency) that they traveled at the speed of light. Hertz also demonstrated that the new radiation could be both reflected and refracted by various dielectric media, in the same manner as light. For example, Hertz was able to focus the waves using a lens made of tree [[pitch (resin)|resin]]. In a later experiment, Hertz similarly produced and measured the properties of [[microwave]]s. These new types of waves paved the way for inventions such as the [[wireless telegraph]] and the [[radio]].\n\nIn 1895 [[Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen]] noticed a new type of radiation emitted during an experiment with an evacuated tube subjected to a high voltage. He called these radiations [[x-ray]]s and found that they were able to travel through parts of the human body but were reflected or stopped by denser matter such as bones. Before long, many uses were found for them in the [[Radiography|field of medicine]].\n\nThe last portion of the electromagnetic spectrum was filled in with the discovery of [[gamma ray]]s. In 1900 [[Paul Villard]] was studying the radioactive emissions of [[radium]] when he identified a new type of radiation that he first thought consisted of particles similar to known alpha and beta particles, but with the power of being far more penetrating than either. However, in 1910, British physicist [[William Henry Bragg]] demonstrated that gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation, not particles, and in 1914, [[Ernest Rutherford]] (who had named them gamma rays in 1903 when he realized that they were fundamentally different from charged alpha and beta particles) and [[Edward Andrade]] measured their wavelengths, and found that gamma rays were similar to X-rays, but with shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies.\n\n==Range of the spectrum==\nElectromagnetic waves are typically described by any of the following three physical properties: the [[frequency]] ''f'', [[wavelength]] [[lambda|\u03bb]], or [[photon]] [[energy]] ''E''. Frequencies observed in astronomy range from {{val|2.4|e=23|u=Hz}} (1 [[GeV]] gamma rays) down to the local [[plasma frequency]] of the ionized interstellar medium (~1&nbsp;kHz). Wavelength is inversely proportional to the wave frequency,<ref name=\"em-spectrum\"/> so gamma rays have very short wavelengths that are fractions of the size of [[atom]]s, where as wavelengths on the opposite end of the spectrum can be as long as the [[universe]]. [[Photon energy]] is directly proportional to the wave frequency, so gamma ray photons have the highest energy (around a billion [[electron volt]]s), while radio wave photons have very low energy (around a [[femto]]electronvolt). These relations are illustrated by the following equations:\n:<math>f = \\frac{c}{\\lambda}, \\quad\\text{or}\\quad f = \\frac{E}{h}, \\quad\\text{or}\\quad E=\\frac{hc}{\\lambda},</math>\nwhere:\n*''c'' = {{val|299792458|u=m/s}} is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum\n*''h'' = {{val|6.62606896|(33)|e=-34|u=J\u00b7s}} = {{val|4.13566733|(10)|e=-15|u=eV\u00b7s}} is [[Planck's constant]].<ref name=\"CODATA\">{{CODATA2006|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?h}}</ref>\n\nWhenever electromagnetic waves exist in a [[Transmission medium|medium]] with [[matter]], their wavelength is decreased. Wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, no matter what medium they are traveling through, are usually quoted in terms of the ''vacuum wavelength'', although this is not always explicitly stated.\n\nGenerally, electromagnetic radiation is classified by wavelength into [[radio wave]], [[microwave]], [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]] (or sub-millimeter) radiation, [[infrared]], the [[visible region]] that is perceived as light, [[ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma rays]]. The behavior of EM radiation depends on its wavelength. When EM radiation interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior also depends on the amount of energy per [[quantum]] (photon) it carries.\n\n[[Spectroscopy]] can detect a much wider region of the EM spectrum than the visible range of 400&nbsp;nm to 700&nbsp;nm. A common laboratory spectroscope can detect wavelengths from 2&nbsp;nm to 2500&nbsp;nm{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source|date=November 2015}}. Detailed information about the physical properties of objects, gases, or even stars can be obtained from this type of device. Spectroscopes are widely used in [[astrophysics]]. For example, many [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emit]] a [[radio wave]] photon that has a wavelength of 21.12&nbsp;cm.

These types of interaction are so different that historically different names have been applied to different parts of the spectrum, as though these were different types of radiation. Thus, although these \"different kinds\" of electromagnetic radiation form a quantitatively continuous spectrum of frequencies and wavelengths, the spectrum remains divided for practical reasons related to these qualitative interaction differences.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width:70%; font-size:95%;\n|+Electromagnetic radiation interaction with matter\n|-\n!

Note that there are no precisely defined boundaries between the bands of the electromagnetic spectrum; rather they fade into each other like the bands in a rainbow (which is the sub-spectrum of visible light). Radiation of each frequency and wavelength (or in each band) has a mix of properties of the two regions of the spectrum that bound it. For example, red light resembles infrared radiation in that it can excite and add energy to some [[chemical bond]]s and indeed must do so to power the chemical mechanisms responsible for [[photosynthesis]] and the working of the [[visual system]].\n\n=== Regions of the spectrum ===\nThe types of electromagnetic radiation are broadly classified into the following classes:<ref name=\"em-spectrum\"/>\n# Gamma radiation\n# X-ray radiation\n# Ultraviolet radiation\n# Visible radiation\n# Infrared radiation\n# Terahertz radiation\n# Microwave radiation\n# Radio waves\nThis classification goes in the increasing order of wavelength, which is characteristic of the type of radiation.<ref name=\"em-spectrum\"/>\nWhile, in general, the classification scheme is accurate, in reality there is often some overlap between neighboring types of electromagnetic energy. For example, SLF radio waves at 60&nbsp;Hz may be received and studied by astronomers, or may be ducted along wires as electric power, although the latter is, in the strict sense, not electromagnetic radiation at all (see [[near and far field]]).\n\nThe distinction between X-rays and gamma rays is partly based on sources: the photons generated from [[nuclear decay]] or other nuclear and subnuclear/particle process, are always termed gamma rays, whereas X-rays are generated by [[electron]]ic transitions involving highly energetic inner atomic electrons.<ref>{{cite book\n |author1=Feynman, Richard |author2=Leighton, Robert |author3=Sands, Matthew |title = The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol.1\n |publisher = Addison-Wesley\n |year = 1963\n |location = USA\n |pages = 2\u20135\n |isbn = 0-201-02116-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n |author1=L'Annunziata, Michael  |author2=Baradei, Mohammad \n |title = Handbook of Radioactivity Analysis\n |publisher = Academic Press\n |year = 2003\n |page = 58\n |url = https://books.google.com/?id=b519e10OPT0C&pg=PA58&dq=gamma+x-ray\n |isbn = 0-12-436603-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n |author1=Grupen, Claus |author2=Cowan, G. |author3=Eidelman, S.

By analogy to electronic transitions, [[muonic atom]] transitions are also said to produce X-rays, even though their energy may exceed {{convert|6|MeV}},<ref>[http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/getdoc/slac-pub-0335.pdf Corrections to muonic X-rays and a possible proton halo] slac-pub-0335 (1967)</ref> whereas there are many (77 known to be less than {{convert|10|keV|abbr=on}}) low-energy nuclear transitions (e.g., the {{convert|7.6|eV|abbr=on}} nuclear transition of [[thorium]]-229), and, despite being one million-fold less energetic than some muonic X-rays, the emitted photons are still called gamma rays due to their nuclear origin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/ems3.html#c5 |title=Gamma-Rays |publisher=Hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref>\n\nThe convention that EM radiation that is known to come from the nucleus, is always called \"gamma ray\" radiation is the only convention that is universally respected, however. Many astronomical [[gamma ray]] sources (such as [[gamma ray burst]]s) are known to be too energetic (in both intensity and wavelength) to be of nuclear origin. Quite often, in high energy physics and in medical radiotherapy, very high energy EMR (in the >10 MeV region)\u2014which is of higher energy than any nuclear gamma ray\u2014is not called X-ray or gamma-ray, but instead by the generic term of \"high energy photons.\"\n\nThe region of the spectrum where a particular observed electromagnetic radiation falls, is [[Frame of reference|reference frame]]-dependent (due to the [[Doppler shift]] for light), so EM radiation that one observer would say is in one region of the spectrum could appear to an observer moving at a substantial fraction of the speed of light with respect to the first to be in another part of the spectrum. For example, consider the [[cosmic microwave background]]. It was produced, when matter and radiation decoupled, by the de-excitation of hydrogen atoms to the ground state. These photons were from [[Lyman series]] transitions, putting them in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Now this radiation has undergone enough cosmological [[red shift]] to put it into the microwave region of the spectrum for observers moving slowly (compared to the speed of light) with respect to the cosmos.\n\n===Radio frequency===\n{{Main article|Radio frequency|Radio spectrum|Radio waves}}\n[[Radio]] waves generally are utilized by [[antenna (radio)|antennas]] of appropriate size (according to the principle of [[resonance]]), with wavelengths ranging from hundreds of meters to about one millimeter. They are used for transmission of data, via [[modulation]]. [[Television]], [[mobile phone]]s, [[wireless networking]], and [[amateur radio]] all use radio waves. The use of the radio spectrum is regulated by many governments through [[frequency allocation]].\n\nRadio waves can be made to carry information by varying a combination of the amplitude, frequency, and phase of the wave within a frequency band. When EM radiation impinges upon a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], it couples to the conductor, travels along it, and [[radio frequency induction|induces]] an electric current on the surface of that conductor by exciting the electrons of the conducting material. This effect (the [[skin effect]]) is used in antennas.\n\n===Microwaves===\n{{Main article|Microwaves}}\n[[File:Atmospheric electromagnetic opacity.svg|thumb|right|350px|Plot of Earth's atmospheric transmittance (or opacity) to various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation.]]\nThe [[super-high frequency]] (SHF) and [[extremely high frequency]] ([[Extremely high frequency|EHF]]) of [[microwave]]s are on the short side of radio waves. Microwaves are waves that are typically short enough (measured in millimeters) to employ tubular metal [[waveguide]]s of reasonable diameter. Microwave energy is produced with [[klystron]] and [[magnetron]] tubes, and with solid state [[diode]]s such as [[Gunn diode|Gunn]] and [[IMPATT diode|IMPATT]] devices. Microwaves are absorbed by molecules that have a [[Molecular dipole moment|dipole moment]] in liquids. In a [[microwave oven]], this effect is used to heat food. Low-intensity microwave radiation is used in [[Wi-Fi]], although this is at intensity levels unable to cause thermal heating.\n\nVolumetric heating, as used by microwave ovens, transfers energy through the material electromagnetically, not as a thermal heat flux. The benefit of this is a more uniform heating and reduced heating time; microwaves can heat material in less than 1% of the time of conventional heating methods.\n\nWhen active, the average microwave oven is powerful enough to cause interference at close range with poorly shielded electromagnetic fields such as those found in mobile medical devices and poorly made consumer electronics.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n===Terahertz radiation===\n{{Main article|Terahertz radiation}}\n\nTerahertz radiation is a region of the spectrum between far infrared and microwaves. Until recently, the range was rarely studied and few sources existed for microwave energy at the high end of the band (sub-millimeter waves or so-called [[terahertz radiation|terahertz waves]]), but applications such as imaging and communications are now appearing. Scientists are also looking to apply terahertz technology in the armed forces, where high-frequency waves might be directed at enemy troops to incapacitate their electronic equipment.<ref>{{cite news|title=Advanced weapon systems using lethal Short-pulse terahertz radiation from high-intensity-laser-produced plasmas |date=March 6, 2005 |url=http://www.indiadaily.com/editorial/1803.asp |work=India Daily |accessdate=2010-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106223741/http://indiadaily.com/editorial/1803.asp |archivedate=6 January 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Infrared radiation===\n{{Main article|Infrared radiation}}\nThe [[infrared]] part of the electromagnetic spectrum covers the range from roughly 300&nbsp;GHz to 400 THz (1&nbsp;mm - 750&nbsp;nm). It can be divided into three parts:<ref name=\"em-spectrum\"/>\n*'''Far-infrared''', from 300&nbsp;GHz to 30 THz (1&nbsp;mm - 10 \u03bcm). The lower part of this range may also be called microwaves or terahertz waves. This radiation is typically absorbed by so-called rotational modes in gas-phase molecules, by molecular motions in liquids, and by [[phonons]] in solids. The water in Earth's atmosphere absorbs so strongly in this range that it renders the atmosphere in effect opaque. However, there are certain wavelength ranges (\"windows\") within the opaque range that allow partial transmission, and can be used for astronomy. The wavelength range from approximately 200 \u03bcm up to a few mm is often referred to as [[Submillimetre astronomy|\"sub-millimeter\" in astronomy]], reserving far infrared for wavelengths below 200 \u03bcm.\n*'''Mid-infrared''', from 30 to 120 THz (10 - 2.5 \u03bcm). Hot objects ([[black-body]] radiators) can radiate strongly in this range, and human skin at normal body temperature radiates strongly at the lower end of this region. This radiation is absorbed by molecular vibrations, where the different atoms in a molecule vibrate around their equilibrium positions. This range is sometimes called the ''fingerprint region'', since the mid-infrared absorption spectrum of a compound is very specific for that compound.\n*'''Near-infrared''', from 120 to 400 THz (2,500 - 750&nbsp;nm). Physical processes that are relevant for this range are similar to those for visible light. The highest frequences in this region can be detected directly by some types of photographic film, and by many types of solid state [[image sensor]]s for [[infrared photography]] and videography.\n\n===Visible radiation (light)===\n{{Main article|Visible spectrum}}\nAbove infrared in frequency comes [[visible light]]. The [[Sun]] emits its peak power in the visible region, although integrating the entire emission power spectrum through all wavelengths shows that the Sun emits slightly more infrared than visible light.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/ |title=Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance:  Air Mass 1.5|accessdate=2009-11-12}}</ref> By definition, visible light is the part of the EM spectrum the [[luminosity function|human eye]] is the most sensitive to. Visible light (and near-infrared light) is typically absorbed and emitted by electrons in molecules and atoms that move from one energy level to another. This action allows the chemical mechanisms that underlie human vision and plant photosynthesis. The light that excites the human [[visual system]] is a very small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. A [[rainbow]] shows the optical (visible) part of the electromagnetic spectrum; infrared (if it could be seen) would be located just beyond the red side of the rainbow with [[ultraviolet]] appearing just beyond the violet end.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation with a [[wavelength]] between 380 [[nanometre|nm]] and 760&nbsp;nm (400\u2013790 terahertz) is detected by the human eye and perceived as visible light. Other wavelengths, especially near infrared (longer than 760&nbsp;nm) and ultraviolet (shorter than 380&nbsp;nm) are also sometimes referred to as light, especially when the visibility to humans is not relevant. White light is a combination of lights of different wavelengths in the visible spectrum. Passing white light through a prism splits it up into the several colors of light observed in the visible spectrum between 400&nbsp;nm and 780&nbsp;nm.\n\nIf radiation having a frequency in the visible region of the EM spectrum reflects off an object, say, a bowl of fruit, and then strikes the eyes, this results in [[visual perception]] of the scene. The brain's visual system processes the multitude of reflected frequencies into different shades and hues, and through this insufficiently-understood psychophysical phenomenon, most people perceive a bowl of fruit.\n\nAt most wavelengths, however, the information carried by electromagnetic radiation is not directly detected by human senses. Natural sources produce EM radiation across the spectrum, and technology can also manipulate a broad range of wavelengths. [[Optical fiber]] transmits light that, although not necessarily in the visible part of the spectrum (it is usually infrared), can carry information. The modulation is similar to that used with radio waves.\n\n===Ultraviolet radiation===\n{{Main article|Ultraviolet}}\n[[File:Ozone altitude UV graph.svg|right|thumb|The amount of penetration of UV relative to altitude in Earth's [[ozone layer|ozone]]]]\nNext in frequency comes [[ultraviolet]] (UV). The wavelength of UV rays is shorter than the violet end of the [[visible spectrum]] but longer than the X-ray.\n\nUV in the very shortest wavelength range (next to X-rays) is capable of ionizing atoms (see [[photoelectric effect]]), greatly changing their physical behavior.\n\nAt the middle range of UV, UV rays cannot ionize but can break chemical bonds, making molecules unusually reactive. [[Sunburn]], for example, is caused by the disruptive effects of middle range UV radiation on [[Human skin|skin]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]], which is the main cause of [[skin cancer]]. UV rays in the middle range can irreparably damage the complex [[DNA]] molecules in the cells producing [[thymine dimers]] making it a very potent [[mutagen]].\n\nThe Sun emits significant UV radiation (about 10% of its total power), including extremely short wavelength UV that could potentially destroy most life on land (ocean water would provide some protection for life there). However, most of the Sun's damaging UV wavelengths are absorbed by the atmosphere and [[ozone layer]] before they reach the surface. The higher energy (shortest wavelength) ranges of UV (called \"vacuum UV\") are absorbed by nitrogen and, at longer wavelengths, by simple diatomic [[oxygen]] in the air. Most of the UV in the mid-range of energy is blocked by the ozone layer, which absorbs strongly in the important 200\u2013315&nbsp;nm range, the lower energy part of which is too long for ordinary [[dioxygen]] in air to absorb. The very lowest energy range of UV between 315&nbsp;nm and visible light (called UV-A) is not blocked well by the atmosphere, but does not cause sunburn and does less biological damage. However, it is not harmless and does create oxygen radicals, mutations and skin damage. See [[ultraviolet]] for more information.\n\n===X-rays===\n{{Main article|X-rays}}\nAfter UV come [[X-ray]]s, which, like the upper ranges of UV are also ionizing. However, due to their higher energies, X-rays can also interact with matter by means of the [[Compton scattering|Compton effect]]. Hard X-rays have shorter wavelengths than soft X-rays and as they can pass through many substances with little absorption, they can be used to 'see through' objects with 'thicknesses' less than that equivalent to a few meters of water. One notable use is diagnostic X-ray imaging in medicine (a process known as [[radiography]]). X-rays are useful as probes in high-energy physics. In astronomy, the accretion disks around [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s emit X-rays, enabling studies of these phenomena. X-rays are also emitted by the [[corona]]s of stars and are strongly emitted by some types of [[nebulae]]. However, [[X-ray telescope]]s must be placed outside the Earth's atmosphere to see astronomical X-rays, since the great depth of the [[atmosphere of Earth]] is opaque to X-rays (with areal density of 1000 grams per cm<sup>2</sup>), equivalent to 10 meters thickness of water.<ref>Koontz, Steve (26 June 2012) [http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120012405.pdf Designing Spacecraft and Mission Operations Plans to Meet Flight Crew Radiation Dose]. NASA/MIT Workshop. See pages I-7 (atmosphere) and I-23 (for water).</ref> This is an amount sufficient to block almost all astronomical X-rays (and also astronomical gamma rays\u2014see below).\n\n===Gamma rays===\n{{Main article|Gamma rays}}\nAfter hard X-rays come [[gamma rays]], which were discovered by [[Paul Villard]] in 1900. These are the most energetic [[photons]], having no defined lower limit to their wavelength. In [[astronomy]] they are valuable for studying high-energy objects or regions, however as with X-rays this can only be done with telescopes outside the Earth's atmosphere. Gamma rays are used experimentally by physicists for their penetrating ability and are produced by a number of  [[radioisotopes]]. They are used for [[irradiation]] of foods and seeds for sterilization, and in medicine they are occasionally used in [[Radiation oncology|radiation cancer therapy]].<ref>[http://www.revisionworld.com/gcse-revision/physics/waves/uses-electromagnetic-waves Uses of Electromagnetic Waves | gcse-revision, physics, waves, uses-electromagnetic-waves | Revision World<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> More commonly, gamma rays are used for diagnostic imaging in [[nuclear medicine]], an example being [[Positron emission tomography|PET scans]]. The wavelength of gamma rays can be measured with high accuracy through the effects of [[Compton scattering]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar |Electromagnetism |Electronics |Telecommunication}}\n{{Colbegin|2}}\n*[[Bandplan]]\n*[[Cosmic ray]]\n*[[Digital dividend after digital television transition]]\n*[[Electroencephalography]]\n*[[Infrared window]]\n*[[Ionizing radiation]]\n*[[List of international common standards]]\n*[[Optical window]]\n*[[Ozone layer]]\n*[[Radiant energy]]\n*[[Radiation]]\n*[[Radio window]]\n*[[Spectroscopy]]\n*[[V band]]\n*[[W band]]\n{{Colend}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Electromagnetic spectrum}}\n*[http://www.unwantedemissions.com/ UnwantedEmissions.com] (U.S. radio spectrum allocations resource)\n*[http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/radcomm/frequency_planning/spectrum_plan/arsp-wc.pdf Australian Radiofrequency Spectrum Allocations Chart] (from Australian Communications and Media Authority)\n*[http://www.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/smt-gst.nsf/vwapj/spectallocation-08.pdf/$FILE/spectallocation-08.pdf Canadian Table of Frequency Allocations] (from [[Industry Canada]])\n*[http://www.ntia.doc.gov/osmhome/allochrt.html U.S. Frequency Allocation Chart] \u2014 Covering the range 3&nbsp;kHz to 300&nbsp;GHz (from [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]])\n*[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/ra/topics/spectrum-strat/future/strat02/strategy02app_b.pdf UK frequency allocation table] (from [[Ofcom]], which inherited the [[Radiocommunications Agency]]'s duties, pdf format)\n*[http://www.e-motiv.net/EM%20spectrum/ Flash EM Spectrum Presentation / Tool]{{dead link|date=July 2016}} \u2013 Very complete and customizable.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090104154951/http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/explain/optics/rendering.html#CIEdiag/ How to render the color spectrum / Code] \u2013 Only approximately right.\n*[http://unihedron.com/projects/spectrum/downloads/spectrum_20090210.pdf Poster \"Electromagnetic Radiation Spectrum\"] (992 kB)\n*[http://prezi.com/3qp57ddr0fmw/electromagnetic-spectrum/ Electromagnetic Spectrum presentation]\n*[http://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo46210 Electromagnetic Spectrum Strategy:  A Call to Action] [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]]\n\n{{Electromagnetic spectrum}}\n{{Color topics}}\n\n[[Category:Electromagnetic spectrum| ]]\n[[Category:Waves]]"}]}}}}
