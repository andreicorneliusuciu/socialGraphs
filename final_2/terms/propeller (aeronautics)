Palmer Jr. ''The birdcage parasol,'' Flying Magazine oct. 1960 p51</ref> for his [[airship]]s. He applied the knowledge he gained from experiences with airships to make a propeller with a steel shaft and aluminium blades for his [[Santos-Dumont 14-bis|14 bis biplane]] in 1906. Some of his designs used a bent aluminium sheet for blades, thus creating an airfoil shape. They were heavily [[Camber (aerodynamics)|undercambered]], and this plus the absence of lengthwise twist made them less efficient than the Wright propellers.<ref>Physical propeller theory was at the time restricted to the [[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine]]-[[William Froude|Froude]] theory, also known as the \"actuator disc theory\" or the axial momentum theory. That theory however adequate, does not give indication on the shape that should be given to the propeller. This would be solved regarding that theory only in the 1920s by complement of the [[Betz' law|Betz]] law (Goldstein, Betz, Prandtl and Lanchester): William Graebel, ''Engineering Fluid Mechanics'', p144 , ISBN 1-560-32711-1, John Carlton, ''Marine Propellers and Propulsion'', p169, ISBN 978-0-08-097123-0. The Wright brothers however were equating the propeller blade to an airfoil instead,  which for they previously had already determined the aerodynamic behavioural patterns: John David Anderson, ''A History of Aerodynamics: And Its Impact on Flying Machines'', ISBN 0-521-66955-3</ref> Even so, this was perhaps the first use of aluminium in the construction of an airscrew. Originally, a rotating airfoil behind the aircraft, which pushes it, was called a propeller, while one which pulled from the front was a [[tractor configuration|tractor]].<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica, 1910 edition, volume 30 (1922 supplement), in the article \"Aeronautics\" page 20. \"Airscrews have been described as 'tractors' and 'propellers', according as the airscrew shaft is placed in tension or in compression by the thrust, and corresponding aeroplanes are usually called by the same names. The first biplanes, those of the Wrights and the Farmans, were of the propeller type, colloquially 'pushers'; almost all monoplanes were 'tractors.'</ref> Later the term 'pusher' became adopted for the rear-mounted device in contrast to the tractor configuration and both became referred to as 'propellers' or 'airscrews'. The understanding of low speed propeller aerodynamics was fairly complete by the 1920s, but later requirements to handle more power in a smaller diameter have made the problem more complex.\n\n==Theory and design of aircraft propellers==\nA well-designed propeller typically has an efficiency of around 80% when operating in the best regime.<ref>[http://www.allstar.fiu.edu/aero/BA-Background.htm Propeller Aircraft Performance and The Bootstrap Approach]</ref> The efficiency of the propeller is influenced by the angle of attack (\u03b1).

Very small pitch and helix angles give a good performance against resistance but provide little thrust, while larger angles have the opposite effect. The best helix angle is when the blade is acting as a wing producing much more lift than drag. Angle of attack is similar to [[advance ratio]], for propellers.\n\nA propeller's [[mechanical efficiency|efficiency]] is determined by<ref name=Spak>[http://web.mit.edu/aeroastro/people/spakovszky.html Prof. Z. S. Spakovszky]. \"[http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node86.html#SECTION06374300000000000000 11.7.4.3 Efficiency]\" ''[[School of Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology#Aeronautics and Astronautics|MIT turbines]]'', 2002.

Therefore, some propellers use a [[#Variable_pitch|variable pitch]] mechanism to alter the blades' pitch angle as engine speed and aircraft velocity are changed.\n[[File:vans.rv-7a.g-jfrv.arp.jpg|thumb|right|The three-bladed propeller of a light aircraft: the [[Van's Aircraft RV-7|Vans RV-7A]]]]\nA further consideration is the number and the shape of the blades used. Increasing the [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] of the blades reduces drag but the amount of thrust produced depends on blade area, so using high-aspect blades can result in an excessive propeller diameter. A further balance is that using a smaller number of blades reduces interference effects between the blades, but to have sufficient blade area to transmit the available power within a set diameter means a compromise is needed. Increasing the number of blades also decreases the amount of work each blade is required to perform, limiting the local [[Mach number]] - a significant performance limit on propellers.\n\nA propeller's performance suffers as the blade speed nears the [[Transonic speed|transonic]]. As the relative air speed at any section of a propeller is a vector sum of the aircraft speed and the tangential speed due to rotation, a propeller blade tip will reach transonic speed well before the aircraft does. When the airflow over the tip of the blade reaches its [[Drag divergence Mach number|critical speed]], drag and torque resistance increase rapidly and [[shock wave]]s form creating a sharp increase in noise. Aircraft with conventional propellers, therefore, do not usually fly faster than Mach 0.6. There have been propeller aircraft which attained up to the Mach 0.8 range, but the low propeller efficiency at this speed makes such applications rare.\n\nThere have been efforts to develop propellers for aircraft at high subsonic speeds.<ref>[http://planesandpilotsofww2.webs.com/Fisher.html ''Pushing The Envelope With Test Pilot Herb Fisher''.] ''Planes and Pilots of World War 2,'' 2000. Retrieved: 22 July 2011.</ref> The 'fix' is similar to that of [[transonic]] wing design. The maximum relative velocity is kept as low as possible by careful control of pitch to allow the blades to have large helix angles; thin blade sections are used and the blades are swept back in a [[scimitar]] shape ([[Scimitar propeller]]); a large number of blades are used to reduce work per blade and so circulation strength; contra-rotation is used. The propellers designed are more efficient than turbo-fans and their cruising speed (Mach 0.7\u20130.85) is suitable for airliners, but the noise generated is tremendous (see the [[Antonov An-70]] and [[Tupolev Tu-95]] for examples of such a design).\n\n===Forces acting on a propeller===\nFive forces act on the blades of an aircraft propeller in motion. Some of these forces can be arranged to couteract each other, reducing the overall mechanical stresses imposed.<ref>{{cite book|title=Airframe and Powerplant Mechanics Powerplant Handbook|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|page=327|url=http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_65-12A.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"beaumont\" />\n;Thrust bending force\n:Thrust loads on the blades, in reaction to the force pushing the air backwards, act to bend the blades forward. blades are therefore often ''raked'' forwards, such that the outward centrifugal force of rotation acts to bend them backwards, thus balancing out the bending effects.\n;Centrifugal and aerodynamic twisting forces\n:A centrifugal twisting force is experienced by any asymmetrical spinning object. In the propeller it acts to twist the blades to a fine pitch. The aerodynamic [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|centre of pressure]] is therefore usually arranged to be slightly forward of its mechanical centreline, creating a twisting moment towards coarse pitch and counteracting the centrifugal moment. However in a high-speed dive the aerodynamic force can change significantly and the moments can become unbalanced.\n;Centrifugal force\n:The force felt by the blades acting to pull them away from the hub when turning. It can be arranged to help counteract the thrust bending force, as described above.\n;Torque bending force\n:Air resistance acting against the blades, combined with [[inertia]]l effects causes propeller blades to bend away from the direction of rotation.\n\n===Curved propeller blades===\nSince the 1940s, propellers and propfans with swept tips or curved \"[[scimitar]]-shaped\" blades have been studied for use in high-speed applications so as to delay the onset of shockwaves, in similar manner to wing sweepback, where the blade tips approach the speed of sound. The [[Airbus A400M]] turboprop transport aircraft is expected to provide the first production example: note that it is not a propfan because the propellers are not mounted directly to the engine shaft but are driven through reduction gearing.\n\n==Varying pitch==\nThe purpose of varying pitch angle is to maintain an optimal angle of attack for the propeller blades, giving maximum efficiency throughout the flight regime. \n\n===Variable pitch===\n[[File:Propeller diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Cut-away view of a [[Hamilton Standard]] propeller. This type of constant-speed propeller was used on many American fighters, bombers and transport aircraft of [[World War II]]]]\nEarly pitch control settings were pilot operated, either with a small number of preset positions or continuously variable.<ref name=\"beaumont\" />\n\nFollowing [[World War I]], automatic propellers were developed to maintain an optimum angle of attack. This was done by balancing the centripetal twisting moment on the blades and a set of counterweights against a spring and the aerodynamic forces on the blade. Automatic props had the advantage of being simple, lightweight, and requiring no external control, but a particular propeller's performance was difficult to match with that of the aircraft's power plant.\n\nModern [[light aircraft]] and advanced [[homebuilt aircraft]] sometimes have variable pitch (VP) propellers.  These tend to be electrically operated and controlled manually or by computer. The [[V-Prop]] is self-powering and self-governing. \n\nA simpler version was the spring-loaded \"two-speed\" VP prop, which was set to fine for takeoff, and then triggered to coarse once in cruise, the propeller then staying in coarse for the remainder of the flight. An even simpler version is the [[ground-adjustable propeller]], which may be adjusted on the ground, but is effectively a fixed-pitch prop once airborne.\n\n===Constant speed===\nAn improvement on the automatic type was the [[constant-speed propeller]]. This type automatically adjusts the blade pitch according to the engine speed, thereby maintaining a constant engine speed for any given manual control setting.<ref name=\"beaumont\" /> Constant-speed propellers allow the pilot to set a rotational speed according to the need for maximum engine power or maximum efficiency, and a [[propeller governor]] acts as a closed-loop [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] to vary propeller pitch angle as required to maintain the selected engine speed. In most aircraft this system is hydraulic, with engine oil serving as the hydraulic fluid. However, electrically controlled propellers were developed during [[World War II]] and saw extensive use on military aircraft, and have recently seen a revival in use on [[homebuilt]] aircraft.{{fact|date=February 2016|reason=claim of recent revival needs independent citation}}\n\n=== Feathering ===\n[[File:Airbus A400M EC-404 ILA 2012 11 (cropped2).jpg|thumb|Feathered propeller on the outboard [[Europrop TP400|TP400]] turboprop of an [[Airbus A400M]]]]\nOn some variable-pitch propellers, the blades can be rotated parallel to the airflow to reduce drag in case of an engine failure. This is called ''feathering'', a term borrowed from [[Rowing (sport)#Anatomy of a stroke|rowing]]. On single-engined aircraft, whether a powered glider or turbine-powered aircraft, the effect is to increase the gliding distance. On a multi-engine aircraft, feathering the propeller on a failed engine helps the aircraft maintain altitude with the reduced power from the remaining engines.\n\nMost feathering systems for reciprocating engines sense a drop in oil pressure and move the blades toward the feather position, and require the pilot to pull the propeller control back to disengage the high-pitch stop pins before the engine reaches idle [[RPM]]. [[Turboprop]] control systems usually utilize a ''negative torque sensor'' in the reduction gearbox which moves the blades toward feather when the engine is no longer providing power to the propeller. Depending on design, the pilot may have to push a button to override the high-pitch stops and complete the feathering process, or the feathering process may be totally automatic.\n\n===Reverse pitch===\nIn some aircraft, such as the [[C-130 Hercules]], the pilot can manually override the constant-speed mechanism to reverse the blade pitch angle, and thus the thrust of the engine (although the rotation of the engine itself does not reverse). This is used to help slow the plane down after landing in order to save wear on the brakes and tires, but in some cases also allows the aircraft to back up on its own - this is particularly useful for getting floatplanes out of confined docks. See also [[Thrust reversal]].\n\n==Counter-rotating propellers==\n{{Main|Counter-rotating propellers}}\nCounter-rotating propellers are sometimes used on twin-, and other multi-[[engine]], propeller-driven aircraft. The propellers of these wing-mounted engines turn in opposite directions from those on the other wing. Generally, the propellers on both engines of most conventional twin-engined aircraft spin clockwise (as viewed from the rear of the aircraft). Counter-rotating propellers generally spin clockwise on the left engine, and counter-clockwise on the right. The advantage of counter-rotating propellers is to balance out the [[torque]] effects of high-power piston engine as well as [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] precession effects ([[p-factor]]) during flight manoeuvres, eliminating the problem of the [[critical engine]]. These are sometimes referred to as \"handed\" propellers since there are left hand and right hand versions of each prop.\n\n==Contra-rotating propeller==\n{{Main|Contra-rotating propellers}}\n[[File:Contrarotating.jpg|thumb|right|Contra-rotating propellers of a modified [[North American P-51 Mustang]] fitted with a [[Rolls-Royce Griffon]] engine.]]\nA contra-rotating propeller or contra-prop places two counter-rotating propellers on concentric drive shafts so that one sits immediately 'downstream' of the other propeller. This provides the benefits of counter-rotating propellers for a single powerplant. The forward propeller provides the majority of the thrust, while the rear propeller also recovers energy lost in the swirling motion of the air in the propeller slipstream. Contra-rotation also increases the ability of a propeller to absorb power from a given engine, without increasing propeller diameter. However the added cost, complexity, weight and noise of the system rarely make it worthwhile and it is only used on high-performance types where ultimate performance is more important than efficiency.\n\n==Aircraft fans==\n{{Main|Propfan|Ducted fan}}\nA fan is a propeller with a large number of blades. A fan therefore produces a lot of thrust for a given diameter but the closeness of the blades means that each strongly affects the flow around the others. If the flow is supersonic, this interference can be beneficial if the flow can be compressed through a series of shock waves rather than one. By placing the [[Ducted fan|fan within a shaped duct]], specific flow patterns can be created depending on flight speed and engine performance. As air enters the duct, its speed is reduced while its pressure and temperature increase. If the aircraft is at a high subsonic speed this creates two advantages: the air enters the fan at a lower Mach speed; and the higher temperature increases the local speed of sound. While there is a loss in efficiency as the fan is drawing on a smaller area of the free stream and so using less air, this is balanced by the ducted fan retaining efficiency at higher speeds where conventional propeller efficiency would be poor. A ducted fan or propeller also has certain benefits at lower speeds but the duct needs to be shaped in a different manner than one for higher speed flight. More air is taken in and the fan therefore operates at an efficiency equivalent to a larger un-ducted propeller. Noise is also reduced by the ducting and should a blade become detached the duct would help contain the damage. However the duct adds weight, cost, complexity and (to a certain degree) drag.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Advance ratio]]\n*[[Axial fan design]]\n*[[Helicopter rotor]]\n*[[List of aircraft propeller manufacturers]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Aircraft propellers}}\n*[http://www.experimentalaircraft.info/homebuilt-aircraft/aircraft-propeller.php Experimental Aircraft Propellers]\n* [http://howthingsfly.si.edu Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum's How Things Fly website]\n\n{{Aircraft gas turbine engine components}}\n{{Aircraft piston engine components}}\n\n[[Category:Aircraft propulsion components]]\n[[Category:Propellers|Aeronautics]]"}]}}}}
