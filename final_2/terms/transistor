It is composed of [[semiconductor]] material usually with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit. A voltage or [[Electric current|current]] applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals controls the current through another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output) [[electric power|power]] can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can [[Amplifier|amplify]] a signal. Today, some transistors are packaged individually, but many more are found embedded in [[integrated circuit]]s.\n\nThe transistor is the fundamental building block of modern [[electronic device]]s, and is ubiquitous in modern electronic systems.

Transistorized [[mechatronics|mechatronic]] circuits have replaced [[cam timer|electromechanical devices]] in controlling appliances and machinery. It is often easier and cheaper to use a standard [[microcontroller]] and write a [[computer program]] to carry out a control function than to design an equivalent mechanical control function.\n\n==Simplified operation==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}\n[[File:Transistor Simple Circuit Diagram with NPN Labels.svg|thumb|A simple circuit diagram to show the labels of a n\u2013p\u2013n bipolar transistor.|312x312px]]\n\nThe essential usefulness of a transistor comes from its ability to use a small signal applied between one pair of its terminals to control a much larger signal at another pair of terminals. This property is called [[Gain (electronics)|gain]]. It can produce a stronger output signal, a voltage or current, which is proportional to a weaker input signal; that is, it can act as an [[amplifier]]. Alternatively, the transistor can be used to turn current on or off in a circuit as an electrically controlled [[switch]], where the amount of current is determined by other circuit elements.\n\nThere are two types of transistors, which have slight differences in how they are used in a circuit. A ''[[bipolar transistor]]'' has terminals labeled '''base''', '''collector''', and '''emitter'''. A small current at the base terminal (that is, flowing between the base and the emitter) can control or switch a much larger current between the collector and emitter terminals. For a ''[[field-effect transistor]]'', the terminals are labeled '''gate''', '''source''', and '''drain''', and a voltage at the gate can control a current between source and drain.\n\nThe image represents a typical bipolar transistor in a circuit. Charge will flow between emitter and collector terminals depending on the current in the base. Because internally the base and emitter connections behave like a semiconductor diode, a voltage drop develops between base and emitter while the base current exists. The amount of this voltage depends on the material the transistor is made from, and is referred to as ''V''<sub>BE</sub>.\n\n===Transistor as a switch===\n[[File:Transistor as switch.svg|thumb|300x300px|BJT used as an electronic switch, in grounded-emitter configuration.]]\n\nTransistors are commonly used in [[digital circuits]] as electronic switches which can be either in an \"on\" or \"off\" state, both for high-power applications such as [[switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]] and for low-power applications such as [[logic gates]]. Important parameters for this application include the current switched, the voltage handled, and the switching speed, characterised by the [[rise time|rise and fall times]].\n\nIn a grounded-emitter transistor circuit, such as the light-switch circuit shown, as the base voltage rises, the emitter and collector currents rise exponentially. The collector voltage drops because of reduced resistance from collector to emitter. If the voltage difference between the collector and emitter were zero (or near zero), the collector current would be limited only by the load resistance (light bulb) and the supply voltage. This is called ''saturation'' because current is flowing from collector to emitter freely. When saturated, the switch is said to be ''on''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Daniel|title=Hands-On Electronics|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-511-07668-8|pages=47\u201354, 60\u201361}}</ref>\n\nProviding sufficient base drive current is a key problem in the use of bipolar transistors as switches. The transistor provides current gain, allowing a relatively large current in the collector to be switched by a much smaller current into the base terminal. The ratio of these currents varies depending on the type of transistor, and even for a particular type, varies depending on the collector current. In the example light-switch circuit shown, the resistor is chosen to provide enough base current to ensure the transistor will be saturated.\n\nIn a switching circuit, the idea is to simulate, as near as possible, the ideal switch having the properties of open circuit when off, short circuit when on, and an instantaneous transition between the two states. Parameters are chosen such that the \"off\" output is limited to leakage currents too small to affect connected circuitry; the resistance of the transistor in the \"on\" state is too small to affect circuitry; and the transition between the two states is fast enough not to have a detrimental effect.\n\n===Transistor as an amplifier===\n[[File:NPN common emitter AC.svg|thumb|366x366px|Amplifier circuit, common-emitter configuration with a voltage-divider bias circuit.]]\n\nThe [[common-emitter amplifier]] is designed so that a small change in voltage (''V''<sub>in</sub>) changes the small current through the base of the transistor; the transistor's current amplification combined with the properties of the circuit mean that small swings in ''V''<sub>in</sub> produce large changes in ''V''<sub>out</sub>.\n\nVarious configurations of single transistor amplifier are possible, with some providing current gain, some voltage gain, and some both.\n\nFrom [[mobile phone]]s to [[television]]s, vast numbers of products include amplifiers for [[sound reproduction]], [[Transmitter|radio transmission]], and [[signal processing]]. The first discrete-transistor audio amplifiers barely supplied a few hundred milliwatts, but power and audio fidelity gradually increased as better transistors became available and amplifier architecture evolved.\n\nModern transistor audio amplifiers of up to a few hundred [[watt]]s are common and relatively inexpensive.\n\n==Comparison with vacuum tubes==\nBefore transistors were developed, [[vacuum tube|vacuum (electron) tubes]] (or in the UK \"thermionic valves\" or just \"valves\") were the main active components in electronic equipment.\n\n===Advantages===\nThe key advantages that have allowed transistors to replace vacuum tubes in most applications are\n* no cathode heater (which produces the characteristic orange glow of tubes), reducing power consumption, eliminating delay as tube heaters warm up, and immune from [[cathode poisoning]] and depletion;\n* very small size and weight, reducing equipment size;\n* large numbers of extremely small transistors can be manufactured as a single [[integrated circuit]];\n* low operating voltages compatible with batteries of only a few cells;\n* circuits with greater energy efficiency are usually possible. For low-power applications (e.g., voltage amplification) in particular, energy consumption can be very much less than for tubes;\n* inherent reliability and very long life; tubes always degrade and fail over time.

This construction produces two [[p\u2013n junction]]s: a base\u2013emitter junction and a base\u2013collector junction, separated by a thin region of semiconductor known as the base region (two junction diodes wired together without sharing an intervening semiconducting region will not make a transistor).\n\nBJTs have three terminals, corresponding to the three layers of semiconductor\u2014an ''emitter'', a ''base'', and a ''collector''.

Because the base is narrow, most of these electrons will diffuse into the reverse-biased (electrons and holes are formed at, and move away from the junction) base\u2013collector junction and be swept into the collector; perhaps one-hundredth of the electrons will recombine in the base, which is the dominant mechanism in the base current. By controlling the number of electrons that can leave the base, the number of electrons entering the collector can be controlled.<ref name=Streetman/> Collector current is approximately \u03b2 (common-emitter current gain) times the base current. It is typically greater than 100 for small-signal transistors but can be smaller in transistors designed for high-power applications.\n\nUnlike the field-effect transistor (see below), the BJT is a low-input-impedance device. Also, as the base\u2013emitter voltage (''V''<sub>BE</sub>) is increased the base\u2013emitter current and hence the collector\u2013emitter current (''I''<sub>CE</sub>) increase exponentially according to the [[diode modelling#Shockley diode model|Shockley diode model]] and the [[Ebers-Moll model]]. Because of this exponential relationship, the BJT has a higher [[transconductance]] than the FET.\n\nBipolar transistors can be made to conduct by exposure to light, because absorption of photons in the base region generates a photocurrent that acts as a base current; the collector current is approximately \u03b2 times the photocurrent. Devices designed for this purpose have a transparent window in the package and are called [[phototransistor]]s.\n\n===Field-effect transistor (FET)===\n{{Main article|Field-effect transistor|MOSFET|JFET}}\n\n[[File:Threshold formation nowatermark.gif|thumb|right|400px|Operation of a [[FET]] and its Id-Vg curve. At first, when no gate voltage is applied. There is no inversion electron in the channel, the device is OFF. As gate voltage increase, inversion electron density in the channel increase, current increase, the device turns on.]]\n\nThe ''[[field-effect transistor]]'', sometimes called a ''unipolar transistor'', uses either electrons (in ''n-channel FET'') or holes (in ''p-channel FET'') for conduction. The four terminals of the FET are named ''source'', ''gate'', ''drain'', and ''body'' (''substrate''). On most FETs, the body is connected to the source inside the package, and this will be assumed for the following description.\n\nIn a FET, the drain-to-source current flows via a conducting channel that connects the ''source'' region to the ''drain'' region. The conductivity is varied by the electric field that is produced when a voltage is applied between the gate and source terminals; hence the current flowing between the drain and source is controlled by the voltage applied between the gate and source. As the gate\u2013source voltage (''V''<sub>GS</sub>) is increased, the drain\u2013source current (''I''<sub>DS</sub>) increases exponentially for ''V<sub>GS</sub>'' below threshold, and then at a roughly quadratic rate (''I''<sub>GS</sub> \u221d (''V''<sub>GS</sub> \u2212 ''V''<sub>T</sub>)<sup>2</sup>) (where ''V''<sub>T</sub> is the threshold voltage at which drain current begins)<ref name=horowitz-hill>{{cite book|last=Horowitz|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Horowitz|author2=[[Winfield Hill]] |title=[[The Art of Electronics]]|edition=2nd|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-37095-7|page=115}}</ref> in the \"[[space charge|space-charge-limited]]\" region above threshold. A quadratic behavior is not observed in modern devices, for example, at the [[65 nanometer|65 nm]] technology node.<ref name=Sansen>\n{{cite book|author=Sansen, W. M. C. |title=Analog design essentials|year= 2006|page=\u00a70152, p. 28|publisher=Springer|location=New York, Berlin|isbn=0-387-25746-2}}</ref>\n\nFor low noise at narrow [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] the higher input resistance of the FET is advantageous.\n\nFETs are divided into two families: ''junction FET'' ([[JFET]]) and ''insulated gate FET'' (IGFET). The IGFET is more commonly known as a ''metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor FET'' ([[MOSFET]]), reflecting its original construction from layers of metal (the gate), oxide (the insulation), and semiconductor. Unlike IGFETs, the JFET gate forms a [[p\u2013n diode]] with the channel which lies between the source and drain. Functionally, this makes the n-channel JFET the solid-state equivalent of the vacuum tube [[triode]] which, similarly, forms a diode between its [[Control grid|grid]] and [[cathode]]. Also, both devices operate in the ''depletion mode'', they both have a high input impedance, and they both conduct current under the control of an input voltage.\n\nMetal\u2013semiconductor FETs ([[MESFET]]s) are JFETs in which the [[Reverse-biased|reverse biased]] p\u2013n junction is replaced by a [[metal\u2013semiconductor junction]]. These, and the HEMTs (high-electron-mobility transistors, or HFETs), in which a two-dimensional electron gas with very high carrier mobility is used for charge transport, are especially suitable for use at very high frequencies (microwave frequencies; several GHz).\n\nFETs are further divided into ''depletion-mode'' and ''enhancement-mode'' types, depending on whether the channel is turned on or off with zero gate-to-source voltage. For enhancement mode, the channel is off at zero bias, and a gate potential can \"enhance\" the conduction. For the depletion mode, the channel is on at zero bias, and a gate potential (of the opposite polarity) can \"deplete\" the channel, reducing conduction. For either mode, a more positive gate voltage corresponds to a higher current for n-channel devices and a lower current for p-channel devices. Nearly all JFETs are depletion-mode because the diode junctions would forward bias and conduct if they were enhancement-mode devices;\nmost IGFETs are enhancement-mode types.\n\n===Usage of bipolar and field-effect transistors===\nThe [[bipolar junction transistor]] (BJT) was the most commonly used transistor in the 1960s and 70s. Even after MOSFETs became widely available, the BJT remained the transistor of choice for many analog circuits such as amplifiers because of their greater linearity and ease of manufacture. In integrated circuits, the desirable properties of MOSFETs allowed them to capture nearly all market share for digital circuits. Discrete MOSFETs can be applied in transistor applications, including analog circuits, voltage regulators, amplifiers, power transmitters and motor drivers.\n\n===Other transistor types===\n[[File:Transistor on portuguese pavement.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Transistor symbol created on [[Portuguese pavement]] in the [[University of Aveiro]].]]\n\n{{For|early bipolar transistors|Bipolar junction transistor#Bipolar transistors}}\n* [[Bipolar junction transistor]] (BJT):\n** [[heterojunction bipolar transistor]], up to several hundred GHz, common in modern ultrafast and RF circuits;\n** [[Schottky transistor]];\n** [[avalanche transistor]]:\n** [[Darlington transistor]]s are two BJTs connected together to provide a high current gain equal to the product of the current gains of the two transistors;\n** [[insulated-gate bipolar transistor]]s (IGBTs) use a medium-power IGFET, similarly connected to a power BJT, to give a high input impedance.

This series sometimes has suffixes (such as \"R\", \"O\", \"BL\", standing for \"red\", \"orange\", \"blue\", etc.) to denote variants, such as tighter ''h''<sub>FE</sub> (gain) groupings.\n\n===European Electronic Component Manufacturers Association (EECA)===\nThe [[Pro Electron]] standard, the European Electronic Component Manufacturers Association part numbering scheme, begins with two letters: the first gives the semiconductor type (A for germanium, B for silicon, and C for materials like GaAs); the second letter denotes the intended use (A for diode, C for general-purpose transistor, etc.). A 3-digit sequence number (or one letter then 2 digits, for industrial types) follows. With early devices this indicated the case type. Suffixes may be used, with a letter (e.g. \"C\" often means high ''h''<sub>FE</sub>, such as in: BC549C<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/BC/BC549.pdf |title=Datasheet for BC549, with A,B and C gain groupings |format=PDF |accessdate=June 30, 2012|work=Fairchild Semiconductor}}</ref>) or other codes may follow to show gain (e.g. BC327-25) or voltage rating (e.g. BUK854-800A<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.datasheetcatalog.org/datasheet/philips/BUK854-800A.pdf |title=Datasheet for BUK854-800A (800volt IGBT) |format=PDF |accessdate=June 30, 2012}}</ref>).

For example, [[2N3055]] is a silicon n\u2013p\u2013n power transistor, 2N1301 is a p\u2013n\u2013p germanium switching transistor. A letter suffix (such as \"A\") is sometimes used to indicate a newer variant, but rarely gain groupings.\n\n===Proprietary===\nManufacturers of devices may have their own proprietary numbering system, for example [[CK722]]. Since devices are [[Second source|second-sourced]], a manufacturer's prefix (like \"MPF\" in MPF102, which originally would denote a [[Motorola]] [[FET]]) now is an unreliable indicator of who made the device. Some proprietary naming schemes adopt parts of other naming schemes, for example a PN2222A is a (possibly [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]) 2N2222A in a plastic case (but a PN108 is a plastic version of a BC108, not a 2N108, while the PN100 is unrelated to other xx100 devices).\n\nMilitary part numbers sometimes are assigned their own codes, such as the [[UK CV series|British Military CV Naming System]].\n\nManufacturers buying large numbers of similar parts may have them supplied with \"house numbers\", identifying a particular purchasing specification and not necessarily a device with a standardized registered number. For example, an HP part 1854,0053 is a (JEDEC) 2N2218 transistor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpmuseum.org/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/hpmuseum/archv010.cgi?read=27258 |title=Richard Freeman's HP Part numbers Crossreference |publisher=Hpmuseum.org |accessdate=June 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sphere.bc.ca/test/hp-parts/300-hpxref.pdf |title=Transistor\u2013Diode Cross Reference \u2013 H.P.

For example, two different devices may be marked \"J176\" (one the J176 low-power [[JFET]], the other the higher-powered [[MOSFET]] 2SJ176).\n\nAs older \"through-hole\" transistors are given [[Surface-mount technology|surface-mount]] packaged counterparts, they tend to be assigned many different part numbers because manufacturers have their own systems to cope with the variety in [[pinout]] arrangements and options for dual or matched n\u2013p\u2013n+p\u2013n\u2013p devices in one pack. So even when the original device (such as a 2N3904) may have been assigned by a standards authority, and well known by engineers over the years, the new versions are far from standardized in their naming.\n\n==Construction==\n\n===Semiconductor material===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px;\"\n|+Semiconductor material characteristics\n!Semiconductor <br> material\n!Junction forward <br> voltage <br> V @ 25&nbsp;\u00b0C\n!Electron mobility <br> m<sup>2</sup>/(V\u00b7s) @ 25&nbsp;\u00b0C\n!Hole mobility <br> m<sup>2</sup>/(V\u00b7s) @ 25&nbsp;\u00b0C\n!Max.<br>junction temp.<br>\u00b0C\n|-\n!Ge\n|0.27||0.39||0.19||70 to 100\n|-\n!Si\n|0.71||0.14|| 0.05||150 to 200\n|-\n!GaAs\n|1.03||0.85||0.05||150 to 200\n|-\n!Al-Si junction\n|0.3||\u2014||\u2014||150 to 200\n|}\n\nThe first BJTs were made from [[germanium]] (Ge). [[Silicon]] (Si) types currently predominate but certain advanced microwave and high-performance versions now employ the ''compound semiconductor'' material [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) and the ''semiconductor alloy'' [[silicon germanium]] (SiGe). Single element semiconductor material (Ge and Si) is described as ''elemental''.\n\nRough parameters for the most common semiconductor materials used to make transistors are given in the adjacent table; these parameters will vary with increase in temperature, electric field, impurity level, strain, and sundry other factors.\n\nThe ''junction forward voltage'' is the voltage applied to the emitter\u2013base junction of a BJT in order to make the base conduct a specified current. The current increases exponentially as the junction forward voltage is increased. The values given in the table are typical for a current of 1 mA (the same values apply to semiconductor diodes). The lower the junction forward voltage the better, as this means that less power is required to \"drive\" the transistor. The junction forward voltage for a given current decreases with increase in temperature. For a typical silicon junction the change is \u22122.1 mV/\u00b0C.<ref name=Sedra>\n{{cite book|author1=Sedra, A.S.  |author2=Smith, K.C.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Microelectronic circuits|year=2004|page=397 and Figure 5.17|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=Fifth|location=New York|isbn=0-19-514251-9}}</ref> In some circuits special compensating elements ([[sensistor]]s) must be used to compensate for such changes.\n\nThe density of mobile carriers in the channel of a MOSFET is a function of the electric field forming the channel and of various other phenomena such as the impurity level in the channel. Some impurities, called dopants, are introduced deliberately in making a MOSFET, to control the MOSFET electrical behavior.\n\nThe ''[[electron mobility]]'' and ''[[hole mobility]]'' columns show the average speed that electrons and holes diffuse through the semiconductor material with an [[electric field]] of 1 volt per meter applied across the material. In general, the higher the electron mobility the faster the transistor can operate. The table indicates that Ge is a better material than Si in this respect. However, Ge has four major shortcomings compared to silicon and gallium arsenide:\n* Its maximum temperature is limited;\n* it has relatively high [[Reverse leakage current|leakage current]];\n* it cannot withstand high voltages;\n* it is less suitable for fabricating integrated circuits.\nBecause the electron mobility is higher than the hole mobility for all semiconductor materials, a given bipolar [[n\u2013p\u2013n transistor]] tends to be swifter than an equivalent [[p\u2013n\u2013p transistor]]. GaAs has the highest electron mobility of the three semiconductors. It is for this reason that GaAs is used in high-frequency applications. A relatively recent FET development, the ''high-electron-mobility transistor'' ([[HEMT]]), has a [[heterojunction|heterostructure]] (junction between different semiconductor materials) of aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs)-gallium arsenide (GaAs) which has twice the electron mobility of a GaAs-metal barrier junction. Because of their high speed and low noise, HEMTs are used in satellite receivers working at frequencies around 12&nbsp;GHz. HEMTs based on [[gallium nitride]] and [[aluminium gallium nitride]] (AlGaN/GaN HEMTs) provide a still higher electron mobility and are being developed for various applications.\n\n'''Max. junction temperature''' values represent a cross section taken from various manufacturers' data sheets. This temperature should not be exceeded or the transistor may be damaged.\n\n'''Al\u2013Si junction''' refers to the high-speed (aluminum\u2013silicon) metal\u2013semiconductor barrier diode, commonly known as a [[Schottky diode]]. This is included in the table because some silicon power IGFETs have a ''[[parasitic structure|parasitic]]'' reverse Schottky diode formed between the source and drain as part of the fabrication process. This diode can be a nuisance, but sometimes it is used in the circuit.\n\n===Packaging===\n{{See also|Semiconductor package|Chip carrier}}\n[[File:Transbauformen.jpg|thumb|Assorted discrete transistors.]]\n[[File:Kt315b.jpg|thumb|Soviet [[KT315]]b transistors.]]\n\n'''Discrete transistors''' are individually packaged transistors. Transistors come in many different [[semiconductor packages]] (see image). The two main categories are ''[[through-hole technology|through-hole]]'' (or ''leaded''), and ''surface-mount'', also known as ''surface-mount device'' ([[surface-mount technology|SMD]]). The ''ball grid array'' ([[Ball grid array|BGA]]) is the latest surface-mount package (currently only for large integrated circuits). It has solder \"balls\" on the underside in place of leads. Because they are smaller and have shorter interconnections, SMDs have better high-frequency characteristics but lower power rating.\n\nTransistor packages are made of glass, metal, ceramic, or plastic. The package often dictates the power rating and frequency characteristics. Power transistors have larger packages that can be clamped to [[heat sink]]s for enhanced cooling. Additionally, most power transistors have the collector or drain physically connected to the metal enclosure. At the other extreme, some surface-mount ''microwave'' transistors are as small as grains of sand.\n\nOften a given transistor type is available in several packages. Transistor packages are mainly standardized, but the assignment of a transistor's functions to the terminals is not: other transistor types can assign other functions to the package's terminals. Even for the same transistor type the terminal assignment can vary (normally indicated by a suffix letter to the part number, q.e. BC212L and BC212K).\n\nNowadays most transistors come in a wide range of SMT packages, in comparison the list of available through-hole packages is relatively small, here is a short list of the most common through-hole transistors packages in alphabetical order:\nATV, E-line, MRT, HRT, SC-43, SC-72, TO-3, TO-18, TO-39, TO-92, TO-126, TO220, TO247, TO251, TO262, ZTX851\n\n====Flexible transistors====\nResearchers have made several kinds of flexible transistors, including [[organic field-effect transistor]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Can We Build a Truly High Performance Computer Which is Flexible and Transparent? |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=3 |doi=10.1038/srep02609 |year=2013 |last1=Rojas |first1=Jhonathan P. |last2=Torres Sevilla |first2=Galo A. |last3=Hussain |first3=Muhammad M. |bibcode = 2013NatSR...3E2609R }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0022-3727/45/14/143001|title=Fast flexible electronics using transferrable silicon nanomembranes|journal=Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics|volume=45|issue=14|pages=143001|year=2012|last1=Zhang|first1=Kan|last2=Seo|first2=Jung-Hun|last3=Zhou|first3=Weidong|last4=Ma|first4=Zhenqiang|bibcode = 2012JPhD...45n3001Z }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/NNANO.2011.1 |pmid=21297625 |title=Flexible high-performance carbon nanotube integrated circuits |journal=Nature Nanotechnology |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=156 |year=2011 |last1=Sun |first1=Dong-Ming |last2=Timmermans |first2=Marina Y. |last3=Tian |first3=Ying |last4=Nasibulin |first4=Albert G. |last5=Kauppinen |first5=Esko I. |last6=Kishimoto |first6=Shigeru |last7=Mizutani |first7=Takashi |last8=Ohno |first8=Yutaka |bibcode = 2011NatNa...6..156S }}</ref> Flexible transistors are useful in some kinds of [[flexible display]]s and other [[flexible electronics]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Band gap]]\n* [[Digital electronics]]\n* [[Moore's law]]\n* [[Semiconductor device modeling]]\n* [[Transistor count]]\n* [[Transistor model]]\n* [[Transresistance]]\n* [[Very-large-scale integration]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Directory of external websites with datasheets==\n* [http://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/2N3903-D.PDF 2N3904]/[http://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/2N3906-D.PDF 2N3906], [http://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/BC182-D.PDF BC182]/[http://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/BC212-D.PDF BC212] and [http://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/BC546-D.PDF BC546]/[http://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/BC556B-D.PDF BC556]: Ubiquitous, BJT, general-purpose, low-power, complementary pairs.
