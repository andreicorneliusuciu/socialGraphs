That is, the [[Bond energy|energy]] needed to propel the spacecraft is contained within the [[chemical bonds]] of the chemical [[molecule]]s involved in the reaction.\n\nThe most commonly used monopropellant is [[hydrazine]] (N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>), a chemical which is a strong [[reducing agent]].  The most common [[Catalysis|catalyst]] is granular [[alumina]] coated with [[iridium]]. These coated granules are usually under the commercial labels Aerojet S-405 (previously made by Shell)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ir.aerojetrocketdyne.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=708514 |title=Aerojet Announces Licensing and Manufacture of Spontaneous Monopropellant Catalyst S-405 |work=aerojetrocketdyne.com |author=Aerojet Rocketdyne |date=12 Jun 2003 |accessdate=9 Jul 2015}}</ref> or W.C.Heraeus H-KC 12 GA (previously made by Kali Chemie).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5LBx4EmBix8C&pg=PA317&lpg=PA317#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Handbook of Space Technology |work=Google Books |author1=Wilfried Ley |author2=Klaus Wittmann |author3=Willi Hallmann |date=2009 |accessdate=9 Jul 2015}}</ref> There is no [[igniter]] with hydrazine.  Shell 405 is a spontaneous catalyst, that is, hydrazine decomposes on contact with the catalyst. The [[Chemical decomposition|decomposition]] is highly [[exothermic]] and produces an 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C (1800&nbsp;\u00b0F) gas that is a mixture of [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]] and [[ammonia]]. Another monopropellant is [[hydrogen peroxide]], which, when purified to 90% or higher concentration, is self-decomposing at high temperatures or when a catalyst is present.\n\nMost chemical-reaction monopropellant rocket systems consist of a [[fuel tank]], usually a [[titanium]] or [[aluminium]] [[sphere]], with an [[Ethylene propylene rubber|ethylene-propylene rubber]] container or a [[surface tension]] propellant management device filled with the fuel. The tank is then pressurized with [[helium]] or [[nitrogen]], which pushes the fuel out to the motors. A [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]] leads from the tank to a [[poppet valve]], and then to the decomposition chamber of the rocket motor. Typically, a [[satellite]] will have not just one motor, but two to twelve, each with its own valve.\n\nThe [[attitude control]] rocket motors for satellites and [[space probes]] are often very small, 25mm (1 inch) or so in [[diameter]], and mounted in groups that point in four directions (within a plane).\n\nThe rocket is fired when the [[computer]] sends [[direct current]] through a small [[electromagnet]] that opens the poppet valve. The firing is often very brief, a few [[millisecond]]s, and \u2014 if operated in air \u2014 would sound like a pebble thrown against a metal trash can; if on for long, it would make a piercing hiss.\n\nChemical-reaction monopropellants are not as efficient as some other propulsion technologies. Engineers choose monopropellant systems when the need for simplicity and reliability outweigh the need for high delivered impulse. If the propulsion system must produce large amounts of thrust, or have a high [[specific impulse]], as on the main motor of an interplanetary spacecraft, other technologies are used.\n\n==Solar-thermal monopropellant thrusters==\nA concept to provide [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) [[propellant depot]]s that could be used as way-stations for other spacecraft to stop and refuel on the way to beyond-LEO missions has proposed that waste gaseous [[hydrogen]]\u2014an inevitable byproduct of long-term [[liquid hydrogen]] storage in the [[Radiative heat transfer|radiative heat]] environment of [[outer space|space]]\u2014would be usable as a monopropellant in a [[Solar thermal rocket|solar-thermal]] propulsion system.  The waste hydrogen would be productively utilized for both [[orbital stationkeeping]] and attitude control, as well as providing limited propellant and thrust to use for [[Orbital maneuver#Non-impulsive maneuvers|orbital maneuvers]] to better [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]] with other spacecraft that would be inbound to receive fuel from the depot.<ref name=aiaa20100902>\n{{cite web|last=Zegler|first=Frank |title=Evolving to a Depot-Based Space Transportation Architecture |url=http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/docs/publications/DepotBasedTransportationArchitecture2010.pdf |work=AIAA SPACE 2010 Conference & Exposition |publisher=AIAA |accessdate=2011-01-25 |author2=Bernard Kutter |date=2010-09-02 |page=3 |quote=the waste hydrogen that has boiled off happens to be the best known propellant (as a monopropellant in a basic solar-thermal propulsion system) for this task.

The [[Advanced Common Evolved Stage]] (ACES) is intended as a lower-cost, more-capable and more-flexible upper stage that would supplement, and perhaps replace, the existing ULA [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] and ULA [[Delta IV#Vehicle description|Delta Cryogenic Second Stage]] (DCSS) upper stage vehicles.  The ACES [[Integrated Vehicle Fluids]] option eliminates all [[hydrazine]] and [[helium]] from the space vehicle\u2014normally used for attitude control and station keeping\u2014and depends instead on solar-thermal monoprop thrusters using waste hydrogen.<ref name=aiaa20100902_p5>Zegler and Kutter, 2010, p. 5.</ref>\n\n==New Developments==\nNASA is developing a new monopropellant propulsion system for small, cost-driven spacecraft with [[delta-v]] requirements in the range of 10\u2013150&nbsp;m/s. This system is based on a [[hydroxylammonium nitrate]] (HAN)/water/fuel monopropellant blend which is extremely dense, environmentally benign, and promises good performance and simplicity.<ref>{{Cite conference |first=Robert S. |last=Jankovsky |title=HAN-Based Monopropellant Assessment for Spacecraft |date=July 1\u20133, 1996 |conference=32nd Joint Propulsion Conference |location=Lake Buena Vista, Florida |publisher=NASA |id=NASA Technical Memorandum 107287; AIAA-96-2863 |url=http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19960048008_1996081001.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe EURENCO Bofors company produced LMP-103S as a 1-to-1 substitute for hydrazine by dissolving 65% [[ammonium dinitramide]], NH<sub>4</sub>N(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, in 35% water solution of [[methanol]] and ammonia.  LMP-103S has 6% higher specific impulse and 30% higher impulse density than hydrazine monopropellant. Additionally, hydrazine is highly toxic and carcinogenic, while LMP-103S is only moderately toxic. LMP-103S is UN Class 1.4S allowing for transport on commercial aircraft, and was demonstrated on the Prisma satellite in 2010. Special handling is not required.  LMP-103S could replace hydrazine as the most commonly used monopropellant.<ref>Swedish Space Corporation Group, ''Monopropellant LMP-103S'', 2011, www.ecap.se{{full citation needed|date=January 2014}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Liquid-propellant rocket]]\n* [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]\n* [[Reaction wheel]]\n* [[Nitrous oxide fuel blend]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.hydrogen-peroxide.us/uses.htm Technical Reports on Hydrogen Peroxide as a Monopropellant for Rockets]\n* [http://www.google.com/patents/US20090133788.pdf USPAT 20090133788 Nitrous oxide fuel blend monopropellants]\n{{spacecraft propulsion}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Monopropellant Rocket}}\n[[Category:Rocket propulsion]]\n[[Category:Rocket engines by propellant]]\n[[Category:Monopropellant rocket engines| ]]\n[[Category:Rocket engines]]\n\n[[pt:Foguete monopropulsor]]"}]}}}}
