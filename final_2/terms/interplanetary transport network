D. |date=2006 |doi=10.1511/2006.59.994 |title=The Interplanetary Transport Network |journal=[[American Scientist]] |volume=94 |issue= |pages=230\u2013237 }}</ref> is a collection of [[gravitation]]ally determined pathways through the [[Solar System]] that require very little [[energy]] for an object to follow.  The ITN makes particular use of [[Lagrange points]] as locations where [[trajectories]] through [[Outer space|space]] are redirected using little or no energy. These points have the peculiar property of allowing objects to [[orbit]] around them, despite lacking an object to orbit. While they use little energy, the transport can take a very long time.\n\n==History==\nThe key to discovering the Interplanetary Transport Network was the investigation of the exact nature of the winding paths near the Earth-Sun and Earth-Moon [[Lagrange point]]s. They were first investigated by [[Jules-Henri Poincar\u00e9]] in the 1890s. He noticed that the paths leading to and from any of those points would almost always settle, for a time, on an orbit about that point.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Marsden |first=J. E. |first2=S.

Soc. |volume=43 |issue= |pages=43\u201373 }}</ref> There are in fact an [[Cardinality of the continuum|infinite]] number of paths taking one to the point and away from it, and all of which require no change in energy to reach. When plotted, they form a tube with the orbit about the Lagrange point at one end. The derivation of these paths traces back to mathematicians [[Charles C. Conley]] and [[Richard P. McGehee]].<ref name=\"Conley, C. C 1968\">{{cite journal |last=Conley |first=C.

Beginning in 1997, [[Martin Lo]], [[Shane D. Ross]], and others wrote a series of papers identifying the mathematical basis that applied the technique to the [[Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis solar wind sample return]], and to lunar and Jovian missions.  They referred to it as an Interplanetary Superhighway (IPS)<ref>Lo, Martin W. and Ross, Shane D. 2001.

This makes sense, since the orbit is unstable, which implies one will eventually end up on one of the outbound paths after spending no energy at all. However, with careful calculation, one can pick ''which'' outbound path one wants. This turned out to be useful, as many of these paths lead to some interesting points in space, such as the Earth's Moon or the [[Galilean moons]] of [[Jupiter]].<ref>Ross, S.D., W.S. Koon, M.W. Lo and J.E. Marsden. 2003. [http://www.esm.vt.edu/~sdross/papers/AAS-03-143.pdf Design of a Multi-Moon Orbiter]. 13th AAS/AIAA [[Space Flight Mechanics]] Meeting, [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]]. Paper No. AAS 03\u2013143.</ref> As a result, for the cost of reaching the Earth\u2013[[Sun]] {{L2}} point, which is rather low energy value, one can travel to a huge number of very interesting points for a little or no additional [[fuel]] cost {{citation needed|reason=I question that such routes exist between the smaller rocky planets. The person who wrote this should provide an example of, say, a path from earth to Mars.|date=November 2015}}.\n\nThe transfers are so low-energy that they make travel to almost any point in the Solar System possible. {{citation needed|reason=I believe there are no tubes linking the Sun-Earth Lagrange points with Sun mars Lagrange points. Nor Earth to Venus. Nor Earth to Mercury. The small rocky planets has very small mass parameters and there aren't a huge number of paths from the sun-rocky planet L1 and L2 regions |date=November 2015}} On the downside, these transfers are very slow, and thus only useful for unmanned probes. Nevertheless, they have already been used to transfer spacecraft to the Earth\u2013Sun {{L1}} point, a useful point for studying the Sun that was employed in a number of recent missions, including the [[Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis mission]], the first to return [[solar wind]] samples to Earth.<ref>Lo, M.

C 1968\"/> For example, the gravity environment of the Sun\u2013Earth\u2013Moon system allows spacecraft to travel great distances on very little fuel {{citation needed|reason=From LEO, 3.2 km/s suffices for escape. To reach Sun earth L1, 3.1 km/s needs to be invested. the fuel savings isn't that great|date=November 2015}}, albeit on an often circuitous route. Launched in 1978, the [[ISEE-3]] spacecraft was sent on a mission to orbit around one of the Lagrange points.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Farquhar |first=R. W. |first2=D.

After the primary mission was completed, ISEE-3 went on to accomplish other goals, including a flight through the [[geomagnetic]] tail and a comet flyby. The mission was subsequently renamed the [[International Cometary Explorer]] (ICE).\n\nThe first low energy transfer using what would later be called the ITN was the rescue of [[Japan]]'s ''[[Hiten]]'' lunar mission in 1991.<ref>{{cite book |last=Belbruno |first=E. |date=2004 |url=http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/titles/7687.html |title=Capture Dynamics and Chaotic Motions in Celestial Mechanics: With the Construction of Low Energy Transfers |publisher=Princeton University Press |location= |isbn=9780691094809 }}</ref> Another example of the use of the ITN was [[NASA]]'s 2001\u20132003 [[Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis mission]], which orbited the Sun\u2013Earth {{L1}} point for over two years collecting material, before being redirected to the {{L2}} Lagrange point, and finally redirected from there back to Earth. The 2003\u20132006 ''[[SMART-1]]'' of the [[European Space Agency]] used another low energy transfer from the ITN.\n\nThe ITN is based around a series of orbital paths predicted by [[chaos theory]] and the [[restricted three-body problem]] leading to and from the unstable orbits around the Lagrange points \u2013 points in space where the [[gravity]] between various bodies balances with the centrifugal force of an object there. For any two bodies in which one body orbits around the other, such as a star/planet or planet/moon system, there are three such points, denoted {{L1}} through {{L3}}. For instance, the Earth\u2013Moon {{L1}} point lies on a line between the two, where gravitational forces between them exactly balance with the centrifugal force of an object placed in orbit there. For two bodies whose ratio of masses exceeds 24.96,<ref name=\"cornish\">{{cite web|url= http://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/media/ContentMedia/lagrange.pdf |title=The Lagrange Points }}, Neil J. Cornish with input from Jeremy Goodman</ref> there are two additional stable points denoted as {{L4}} and {{L5}}. These five points have particularly low [[delta-v]] requirements, and appear to be the lowest-energy transfers possible, even lower than the common [[Hohmann transfer orbit]] that has dominated orbital navigation in the past.\n\nAlthough the forces balance at these points, the first three points (the ones on the line between a certain large mass, e.g. a [[star]], and a smaller, orbiting mass, e.g. a [[planet]]) are not stable [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] points. If a [[spacecraft]] placed at the Earth\u2013Moon {{L1}} point is given even a slight nudge towards the Moon, for instance, the Moon's gravity will now be greater and the spacecraft will be pulled away from the {{L1}} point. The entire system is in motion, so the spacecraft will not actually hit the Moon, but will travel in a winding path, off into space. There is, however, a semi-stable orbit around each of these points, called a [[halo orbit]]. The orbits for two of the points, {{L4}} and {{L5}}, are stable, but the halo orbits for {{L1}} through {{L3}} are stable only on the order of [[month]]s.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Gravity assist]]\n*[[Gravitational keyhole]]\n*[[Orbital mechanics]]\n*[[Interplanetary spaceflight]]\n*[[Hill sphere]]\n*[[Horseshoe orbit]]\n*[[Halo orbit]]\n\n==Sources and notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www2.esm.vt.edu/~sdross/papers/AmericanScientist2006.pdf \"The Interplanetary Transport Network\"] // American Scientist, May\u2013June 2006 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1511/2006.59.994 (Subscription)]\n* [http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18925441.300.html \"Ride the celestial subway\" New Scientist, 27 March 2006]\n* [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol310/issue5751/r-samples.dtl#310/5751/1114a \"Tube Route\" Science, 18 November 2005]\n* [http://sciencenews.org/articles/20050416/bob9.asp \"Navigating Celestial Currents\" Science News, 18 April 2005]\n* [http://pr.caltech.edu/periodicals/EandS/articles/LXV4/exit.html \"Next Exit 0.5 Million Kilometers\" Engineering and Science, 2002]\n* [http://www.spacedaily.com/news/cosmology-05z.html \"Mathematics Unites The Heavens And The Atom\" Space Daily, 28 September 2005]\n* [http://focus.aps.org/story/v9/st31 \"Asteroids Lost in Space\" Physical Review Focus, 14 June 2002]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c00f1DiHygI Interplanetary Transport Network lecture (YouTube)] by [[Shane D.
