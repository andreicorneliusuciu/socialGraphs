This contrasts with the broader term ''[[multimedia]]'', which may include non-interactive linear presentations as well as hypermedia. It is also related to the field of [[electronic literature]]. The term was first used in a 1965 article by [[Ted Nelson]].<ref>http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=806036 Complex information processing: a file structure for the complex, the changing and the indeterminate</ref>\n\nThe [[World Wide Web]] is a classic example of hypermedia, whereas a non-interactive [[Movie theater|cinema]] presentation is an example of standard multimedia due to the absence of hyperlinks.\n\nThe first hypermedia work was, arguably, the  [[Aspen Movie Map]]. [[Bill Atkinson]]'s [[HyperCard]] popularized hypermedia writing, while a variety of literary hypertext and [[hypertext]] works, fiction and nonfiction, demonstrated the promise of links. Most modern hypermedia is delivered via [[Pagination (disambiguation)|electronic pages]] from a variety of systems including [[Media player (application software)|media players]], [[web browser]]s, and stand-alone applications (i.&nbsp;e., software that does not require network access). Audio hypermedia is emerging with [[voice command device]]s and [[voice browser|voice browsing]].\n\n==Development tools==\nHypermedia may be developed a number of ways. Any [[programming tool]] can be used to write programs that link data from internal variables and [[Node (computer science)|nodes]] for external data files. Multimedia development software such as [[Adobe Flash]], [[Adobe Director]], [[Macromedia Authorware]], and MatchWare Mediator may be used to create stand-alone hypermedia applications, with emphasis on entertainment content. Some [[database]] software such as [[FoxPro|Visual FoxPro]] and [[FileMaker|FileMaker Developer]] may be used to develop stand-alone hypermedia applications, with emphasis on educational and business content management.\n\nHypermedia applications may be developed on embedded devices for the mobile and the [[digital signage]] industries using the [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] (SVG) specification from W3C ([[World Wide Web Consortium]]). Software applications such as [[Ikivo Animator]] and [[Inkscape]] simplify the development of hypermedia content based on SVG. Embedded devices such as [[iPhone]] natively support SVG specifications and may be used to create mobile and distributed hypermedia applications.\n\nHyperlinks may also be added to [[data file]]s using most [[business software]] via the limited [[scripting language|scripting]] and [[hyperlink]]ing features built in. Documentation software such as the [[Microsoft Office Suite]] and [[LibreOffice]] allow for hypertext links to other content within the same file, other external files, and [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] links to files on external [[file server]]s. For more emphasis on graphics and [[page layout]], hyperlinks may be added using most modern [[desktop publishing]] tools. This includes [[presentation program]]s, such as [[Microsoft Powerpoint]] and [[LibreOffice Impress]], add-ons to print layout programs such as [[QuarkXPress|Quark Immedia]], and tools to include hyperlinks  in [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] documents such as [[Adobe InDesign]] for creating and [[Adobe Acrobat]] for editing. [[Hyper Publish]] is a tool specifically designed and optimized for hypermedia and hypertext management. Any [[HTML editor]] may be used to build [[HTML]] files, accessible by any web browser. [[CD/DVD authoring]] tools such as [[DVD Studio Pro]] may be used to hyperlink the content of [[DVD]]s for [[DVD player]]s or web links when the disc is played on a [[personal computer]] connected to the internet.\n\n==Learning==\nThere have been a number of theories concerning hypermedia and learning. One important claim in the literature on hypermedia and learning is that it offers more control over the instructional environment to the reader or student. Another claim is that it makes level the playing field among students of varying abilities and enhances collaborative learning.\nA claim from psychology includes the notion that hypermedia more closely models the structure of the brain, in comparison with printed text.<ref>Terry K.

Retrieved August 3, 2010.</ref>\n\n==Language learning==\nHypermedia has found a place in foreign language instruction as well. Hypermedia reading texts can be purchased or prepared so that students can click on unfamiliar words or phrases in a foreign language and then access all the information needed to understand the word or phrase. Information can be in any medium, for example, text-based translations, definitions, grammatical explanations, and cultural references. Also, audio recordings of the pronunciation as well as images, animations and video for visualization. Some of the innovations in this area were the original products from [[Transparent Language]] as well as Ottmar Foelsche's Annotext and Thom Thibeault's hypermedia editor, FLAn.\n\n==Application programming interfaces==\nHypermedia is used as a medium and constraint in certain [[application programming interface]]s. [[HATEOAS]], Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State, is a constraint of the [[Representational state transfer|REST application architecture]] where a client interacts with the server entirely through hypermedia provided dynamically by application servers. This means that in theory no [[API]] documentation is needed, because the client needs no prior knowledge about how to interact with any particular application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia. In other [[service-oriented architecture]]s (SOA), clients and servers interact through a fixed [[Interface (computing)|interface]] shared through documentation or an [[interface description language]] (IDL).\n\n==Cultural references==\n''[[Hyperland]]'' is a 1990 documentary film that focuses on [[Douglas Adams]] and explains adaptive hypertext and hypermedia.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cybertext]]\n* [[Electronic literature]]\n* [[Metamedia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite journal|last=Hicks|first=David L.|author2=John J.
