In 2000, the [[U.S. Congress]] authorized the modernization effort, [[GPS Block IIIA|GPS III]].\n\nIn addition to GPS, other systems are in use or under development, mainly because of a potential denial of access and potential monitoring by the US government.  The Russian Global Navigation Satellite System ([[GLONASS]]) was developed contemporaneously with GPS, but suffered from incomplete coverage of the globe until the mid-2000s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Russia Launches Three More GLONASS-M Space Vehicles|url=http://www.insidegnss.com/node/982|publisher=''[[Inside GNSS]]''|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}</ref> GLONASS can be added to GPS devices which makes more satellites available and enabling positions to be fixed more quickly and accurately, to within 2 meters <ref>[http://blog.clove.co.uk/2012/01/10/glonass-the-future-for-all-smartphones/ GLONASS the future for all smartphones?]</ref> There are also the planned European Union [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo positioning system]], China's [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System]], the Japanese [[Quasi-Zenith Satellite System]], and India's [[Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System]] (NAVIC).\n\n==History==\nThe design of GPS is based partly on similar ground-based radio-navigation systems, such as [[LORAN]] and the [[Decca Navigator System|Decca Navigator]], developed in the early 1940s and used by the British Royal Navy during [[World War II]].\n\nIn 1956, the German-American physicist [[Friedwardt Winterberg]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Winterberg|first1=Friedwardt|title=Relativistische Zeitdiiatation eines k\u00fcnstlichen Satelliten (Relativistic time dilation of an artificial satellite)|journal=Astronautica Acta II|date=1956|issue=25|url=http://bourabai.kz/winter/satelliten.htm|accessdate=19 October 2014|language=German}}</ref> proposed a test of [[general relativity]]&nbsp;\u2014 detecting time slowing in a strong [[Gravity|gravitational]] field using accurate [[atomic clock]]s placed in orbit inside artificial satellites.\n\nSpecial and general relativity predict that the clocks on the GPS satellites would be seen by the Earth's observers to run 38 microseconds faster per day than the clocks on the Earth. The GPS calculated positions would quickly drift into error, accumulating to 10 kilometers per day. The relativistic time effect of the GPS clocks running faster than the clocks on earth was corrected for in the design of GPS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html|title=GPS and Relativity|publisher=Astronomy.ohio-state.edu|accessdate=November 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Predecessors===\nThe [[Soviet Union]] launched the first man-made satellite, [[Sputnik 1]], in 1957.

The Director of the APL gave them access to their [[UNIVAC I|UNIVAC]] to do the heavy calculations required.\n\nThe next spring, Frank McClure, the deputy director of the APL, asked Guier and Weiffenbach to investigate the inverse problem&nbsp;\u2014 pinpointing the user's location, given that of the satellite. (At the time, the Navy was developing the submarine-launched [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] missile, which required them to know the submarine's location.) This led them and APL to develop the [[Transit (satellite)|TRANSIT]] system.<ref>{{citation|title=Where good ideas come from, the natural history of innovation|author=Steven Johnson|publisher=Riverhead Books|place=New York|year=2010}}</ref> In 1959, ARPA (renamed [[DARPA]] in 1972) also played a role in TRANSIT.<ref>{{cite book | title=Transit to Tomorrow.

Limitations of these systems drove the need for a more universal navigation solution with greater accuracy.\n\nWhile there were wide needs for accurate navigation in military and civilian sectors, almost none of those was seen as justification for the billions of dollars it would cost in research, development, deployment, and operation for a constellation of navigation satellites. During the [[Cold War]] [[arms race]], the nuclear threat to the existence of the United States was the one need that did justify this cost in the view of the United States Congress. This deterrent effect is why GPS was funded. It is also the reason for the ultra secrecy at that time. The [[nuclear triad]] consisted of the United States Navy's [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBMs) along with [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) [[strategic bomber]]s and [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs). Considered vital to the [[Nuclear strategy|nuclear deterrence]] posture, accurate determination of the SLBM launch position was a [[Force multiplication|force multiplier]].\n\nPrecise navigation would enable United States [[ballistic missile submarine]]s to get an accurate fix of their positions before they launched their SLBMs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018151253/http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archivedate=October 18, 2007|title=Why Did the Department of Defense Develop GPS?|publisher=Trimble Navigation Ltd|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}</ref> The USAF, with two thirds of the nuclear triad, also had requirements for a more accurate and reliable navigation system. The Navy and Air Force were developing their own technologies in parallel to solve what was essentially the same problem.\n\nTo increase the survivability of ICBMs, there was a proposal to use mobile launch platforms (such as Russian [[RT-23 Molodets|SS-24]] and [[RT-2PM Topol|SS-25]]) and so the need to fix the launch position had similarity to the SLBM situation.\n\nIn 1960, the Air Force proposed a radio-navigation system called MOSAIC (MObile System for Accurate ICBM Control) that was essentially a 3-D&nbsp;[[LORAN]]. A follow-on study, Project&nbsp;57, was worked in 1963 and it was \"in this study that the GPS concept was born.\" That same year, the concept was pursued as Project&nbsp;621B, which had \"many of the attributes that you now see in GPS\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2002/01.html|title=Charting a Course Toward Global Navigation|publisher=The Aerospace Corporation|accessdate=October 14, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021101215923/http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2002/01.html|archivedate=November 1, 2002<!--, 01:01:18-->}}</ref> and promised increased accuracy for Air Force bombers as well as ICBMs.\n\nUpdates from the Navy TRANSIT system were too slow for the high speeds of Air Force operation. The Naval Research Laboratory continued advancements with their Timation (Time Navigation) satellites, first launched in 1967, and with the third one in 1974 carrying the first atomic clock into orbit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.radioshack.com/support_tutorials/gps/gps_tmline.htm|title=A Guide to the Global Positioning System (GPS)&nbsp;\u2014 GPS Timeline|publisher=Radio Shack|accessdate=January 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAnother important predecessor to GPS came from a different branch of the United States military. In 1964, the [[United States Army]] orbited its first Sequential Collation of Range ([[SECOR]]) satellite used for geodetic surveying.<ref>{{cite web |title=  GEODETIC EXPLORER-A Press Kit |date=October 29, 1965 |accessdate=20 October 2015 |publisher=NASA |url=http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660002550_1966002550.pdf}}</ref> The SECOR system included three ground-based transmitters from known locations that would send signals to the satellite transponder in orbit. A fourth ground-based station, at an undetermined position, could then use those signals to fix its location precisely. The last SECOR satellite was launched in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/secor.htm|title=SECOR Chronology|work=Mark Wade's Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=January 19, 2010}}</ref>\n\nDecades later, during the early years of GPS, civilian surveying became one of the first fields to make use of the new technology, because surveyors could reap benefits of signals from the less-than-complete GPS constellation years before it was declared operational. GPS can be thought of as an evolution of the SECOR system where the ground-based transmitters have been migrated into orbit.\n\n===Development===\nWith these parallel developments in the 1960s, it was realized that a superior system could be developed by synthesizing the best technologies from 621B, Transit, Timation, and SECOR in a multi-service program.\n\nDuring Labor Day weekend in 1973, a meeting of about twelve military officers at the Pentagon discussed the creation of a ''Defense Navigation Satellite System (DNSS)''. It was at this meeting that the real synthesis that became GPS was created. Later that year, the DNSS program was named ''Navstar'', or Navigation System Using Timing and Ranging.<ref>[http://www.au.af.mil/au/cadre/aspj/airchronicles/aureview/1981/may-jun/garwin.htm \"MX Deployment Reconsidered.\"] Retrieved: 7 June 2013.</ref> With the individual satellites being associated with the name Navstar (as with the predecessors Transit and Timation), a more fully encompassing name was used to identify the constellation of Navstar satellites, ''Navstar-GPS''.<ref>{{cite book|url= {{google books|plainurl=y|id=mB9W3H90KDUC}}|title=The Precision Revolution: GPS and the Future of Aerial Warfare|author1=Michael Russell Rip |author2=James M.

This changed with President [[Bill Clinton]] signing a policy directive in 1996 to turn off Selective Availability in May 2000 to provide the same precision to civilians that was afforded to the military. The directive was proposed by the U.S. Secretary of Defense, [[William Perry]], because of the widespread growth of [[differential GPS]] services to improve civilian accuracy and eliminate the U.S. military advantage. Moreover, the U.S. military was actively developing technologies to deny GPS service to potential adversaries on a regional basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngs.woc.noaa.gov/FGCS/info/sans_SA/docs/GPS_SA_Event_QAs.pdf |title=GPS & Selective Availability Q&A |publisher=NOAA] |accessdate=May 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050921115614/http://ngs.woc.noaa.gov/FGCS/info/sans_SA/docs/GPS_SA_Event_QAs.pdf |archivedate=September 21, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nSince its deployment, the U.S. has implemented several improvements to the GPS service including new signals for civil use and increased accuracy and integrity for all users, all the while maintaining compatibility with existing GPS equipment. Modernization of the satellite system has been an ongoing initiative by the U.S. Department of Defense through a series of [[GPS Block IIIA|satellite acquisitions]] to meet the growing needs of the military, civilians, and the commercial market.\n\nAs of early 2015, high-quality, FAA grade, Standard Positioning Service (SPS) GPS receivers provide horizontal accuracy of better than 3.5 meters,<ref name=\"GPS Accuracy\">{{cite web|title=GPS Accuracy|url=http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/|website=GPS.gov|publisher=GPS.gov|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref> although many factors such as receiver quality and atmospheric issues can affect this accuracy.\n\nGPS is owned and operated by the United States Government as a national resource.

The IAF Honors and Awards Committee recognized the uniqueness of the GPS program and the exemplary role it has played in building international collaboration for the benefit of humanity.\n\n==Basic concept of GPS==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}\n\n===Fundamentals===\nThe GPS concept is based on time and the known position of specialized satellites. The satellites carry very stable [[atomic clocks]] that are synchronized with one another and to ground clocks. Any drift from true time maintained on the ground is corrected daily. Likewise, the satellite locations are known with great precision. GPS receivers have clocks as well; however, they are usually not synchronized with true time, and are less stable. GPS satellites continuously transmit their current time and position. A GPS receiver monitors multiple satellites and solves equations to determine the precise position of the receiver and its deviation from true time. At a minimum, four satellites must be in view of the receiver for it to compute four unknown quantities (three position coordinates and clock deviation from satellite time).\n\n===More detailed description===\nEach GPS satellite continually broadcasts a signal ([[carrier wave]] with [[modulation]]) that includes:\n* A pseudorandom code (sequence of ones and zeros) that is known to the receiver. By time-aligning a receiver-generated version and the receiver-measured version of the code, the time of arrival (TOA) of a defined point in the code sequence, called an epoch, can be found in the receiver clock time scale\n* A message that includes the time of transmission (TOT) of the code epoch (in GPS system time scale) and the satellite position at that time\n\nConceptually, the receiver measures the TOAs (according to its own clock) of four satellite signals. From the TOAs and the TOTs, the receiver forms four [[time of flight]] (TOF) values, which are (given the speed of light) approximately equivalent to receiver-satellite range differences. The receiver then computes its three-dimensional position and clock deviation from the four TOFs.\n\nIn practice the receiver position (in three dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] with origin at the Earth's center) and the offset of the receiver clock relative to the GPS time are computed simultaneously, using the [[#Navigation equations|navigation equations]] to process the TOFs.\n\nThe receiver's Earth-centered solution location is usually converted to [[latitude]], [[longitude]] and height relative to an ellipsoidal Earth model. The height may then be further converted to height relative to the [[geoid]] (e.g., [[EGM96]]) (essentially, mean [[sea level]]). These coordinates may be displayed, e.g., on a [[moving map display]], and/or recorded and/or used by some other system (e.g., a vehicle guidance system).\n\n===User-satellite geometry===\nAlthough usually not formed explicitly in the receiver processing, the conceptual time differences of arrival (TDOAs) define the measurement geometry. Each TDOA corresponds to a [[hyperboloid]] of revolution (see [[Multilateration]]). The line connecting the two satellites involved (and its extensions) forms the axis of the hyperboloid. The receiver is located at the point where three hyperboloids intersect.<ref name=\"Abel1\">Abel, J.S. and Chaffee, J.W., \"Existence and uniqueness of GPS solutions\", ''IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems'', vol:26, no:6, p:748-53, Sept. 1991.</ref><ref name=\"Fang\">Fang, B.T., \"Comments on \"Existence and uniqueness of GPS solutions\" by J.S. Abel and J.W. Chaffee\", ''IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems'', vol:28 , no:4, Oct. 1992.</ref>\n\nIt is sometimes incorrectly said that the user location is at the intersection of three spheres. While simpler to visualize, this is only the case if the receiver has a clock synchronized with the satellite clocks (i.e., the receiver measures true ranges to the satellites rather than range differences). There are significant performance benefits to the user carrying a clock synchronized with the satellites. Foremost is that only three satellites are needed to compute a position solution. If this were part of the GPS system concept so that all users needed to carry a synchronized clock, then a smaller number of satellites could be deployed. However, the cost and complexity of the user equipment would increase significantly.\n\n===Receiver in continuous operation===\nThe description above is representative of a receiver start-up situation. Most receivers have a [[track algorithm]], sometimes called a ''tracker'', that combines sets of satellite measurements collected at different times\u2014in effect, taking advantage of the fact that successive receiver positions are usually close to each other. After a set of measurements are processed, the tracker predicts the receiver location corresponding to the next set of satellite measurements. When the new measurements are collected, the receiver uses a weighting scheme to combine the new measurements with the tracker prediction. In general, a tracker can (a) improve receiver position and time accuracy, (b) reject bad measurements, and (c) estimate receiver speed and direction.\n\nThe disadvantage of a tracker is that changes in speed or direction can only be computed with a delay, and that derived direction becomes inaccurate when the distance traveled between two position measurements drops below or near the [[random error]] of position measurement. GPS units can use measurements of the [[Doppler shift]] of the signals received to compute velocity accurately.<ref>{{cite book |title=Global Positioning Systems, Inertial Navigation, and Integration |edition=2nd |first1=Mohinder S. |last1=Grewal |first2=Lawrence R. |last2=Weill |first3=Angus P. |last3=Andrews |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2007 |isbn=0-470-09971-2 |pages=92\u201393 |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=6P7UNphJ1z8C}}}}, {{google books|plainurl=y|id=6P7UNphJ1z8C|page=92 |title=Extract of pages 92\u201393}}</ref> More advanced navigation systems use additional sensors like a [[compass]] or an [[inertial navigation system]] to complement GPS.\n\n===Non-navigation applications===\n{{for|a list of applications|#Applications}}\nIn typical GPS operation as a navigator, four or more satellites must be visible to obtain an accurate result. The solution of the [[#Navigation equations|navigation equations]] gives the position of the receiver along with the difference between the time kept by the receiver's on-board clock and the true time-of-day, thereby eliminating the need for a more precise and possibly impractical receiver based clock. Applications for GPS such as [[time transfer]], traffic signal timing, and [[IS-95#Physical layer|synchronization of cell phone base stations]], make use of this cheap and highly accurate timing. Some GPS applications use this time for display, or, other than for the basic position calculations, do not use it at all.\n\nAlthough four satellites are required for normal operation, fewer apply in special cases. If one variable is already known, a receiver can determine its position using only three satellites. For example, a ship or aircraft may have known elevation. Some GPS receivers may use additional clues or assumptions such as reusing the last known [[altitude]], [[dead reckoning]], [[inertial navigation system|inertial navigation]], or including information from the vehicle computer, to give a (possibly degraded) position when fewer than four satellites are visible.<ref>{{cite web|title=Continuous Navigation Combining GPS with Sensor-Based Dead Reckoning|url=http://www.gpsworld.com/gpsworld/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=154870&pageID=6|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111202317/http://www.gpsworld.com/gpsworld/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=154870&pageID=6|archivedate=November 11, 2006|date=April 1, 2005|author1=Georg zur Bonsen |author2=Daniel Ammann |author3=Michael Ammann |author4=Etienne Favey |author5=Pascal Flammant |publisher=GPS World}}</ref><ref name=\"NAVGPS\">{{cite web|title=NAVSTAR GPS User Equipment Introduction|format=PDF|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/gps/gpsuser/gpsuser.pdf|publisher=United States Government}} Chapter 7</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=GPS Support Notes|url=http://www.navmanwireless.com/uploads/EK/C8/EKC8zb1ITsNwDqWcqLQxiQ/Support_Notes_GPS_OperatingParameters.pdf|format=PDF|date=January 19, 2007|accessdate=November 10, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327051208/http://www.navmanwireless.com/uploads/EK/C8/EKC8zb1ITsNwDqWcqLQxiQ/Support_Notes_GPS_OperatingParameters.pdf|archivedate=March 27, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}\nThe current GPS consists of three major segments.

In general, GPS receivers are composed of an antenna, tuned to the frequencies transmitted by the satellites, receiver-processors, and a highly stable clock (often a [[crystal oscillator]]). They may also include a display for providing location and speed information to the user. A receiver is often described by its number of channels: this signifies how many satellites it can monitor simultaneously. Originally limited to four or five, this has progressively increased over the years so that, {{As of|2007|lc=on}}, receivers typically have between 12 and 20&nbsp;channels.{{efn|Though there are many receiver manufacturers, they almost all use one of the chipsets produced for this purpose.}}\n\n[[File:j32 1 small.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A typical [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] GPS receiver module measuring 15\u00d717&nbsp;mm.]]\n\nGPS receivers may include an input for differential corrections, using the [[RTCM]] SC-104 format.

What is more, the OMA SUPL A-GPS standard has enabled lower cost deployment of A-GPS services that ensure a better and more consistent user experience necessary for the mass consumer market. The SUPL A-GPS standard allows network operators or handset manufacturers to deploy assistance services that reduce the time to first fix, lowers the power consumption, and enhances the sensitivity of the GPS receiver. The SUPL standard uses User Plane communication channels such as SMS and GPRS to transport the aiding data, as opposed to the control plane channels in networks, thereby reducing the load on the networks, as well as complexity and cost of service deployment. New business models have also become possible, ranging from hosted services for operators that want to minimize capital investments, to services deployed by handset vendors for end-users that cannot get similar services from their network operator yet.\n\nThe major handset software platforms and operating systems are evolving, ensuring easier integration of GPS functionality for handset manufacturers and more powerful features for application developers. Along with the improving performance of handsets, in terms of screen size, processing power and memory size, current handsets thus provide much better platforms for location-enabled applications and services than before.\n\nThe GPS value-chain was reshaped considerably in 2007 as several specialist GPS technology developers were acquired by wireless chipset vendors. These transactions are likely to enhance the possibilities to meet handset manufacturers' demand for integrated connectivity solutions that include GPS at ever lower price points to enable true mass market deployment.\n\nSales of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets grew to about 24.5 million units in 2007 according to independent analyst firm Berg Insight. Although the number is very small in comparison with the 150 million GPS-enabled CDMA handsets sold, the number is growing rapidly. Berg Insight estimates that shipments of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets will grow to 370&nbsp;million units in 2012, the equivalent of more than 26 percent of all GSM/WCDMA handsets sold that year. Including CDMA handsets, GPS-enabled handsets sales are estimated to reach about 560&nbsp;million, or 35&nbsp;percent of total handset shipments in 2012.\n\n-->\n\n====Restrictions on civilian use====\nThe U.S. government controls the export of some civilian receivers.

Vendor interpretations differ. The rule refers to operation at both the target altitude and speed, but some receivers stop operating even when stationary. This has caused problems with some amateur radio balloon launches that regularly reach {{convert|30|km|ft|sigfig=1|abbr=in|sp=us}}.\n\nThese limits only apply to units or components exported from the USA.

Each complete message takes 750 seconds (12 1/2 minutes) to complete. The message structure has a basic format of a 1500-bit-long frame made up of five subframes, each subframe being 300 bits (6 seconds) long. Subframes 4 and 5 are [[commutation (telemetry)|subcommutated]] 25 times each, so that a complete data message requires the transmission of 25 full frames. Each subframe consists of ten words, each 30 bits long. Thus, with 300 bits in a subframe times 5 subframes in a frame times 25 frames in a message, each message is 37,500 bits long. At a transmission rate of 50-bit/s, this gives 750 seconds to transmit an entire [[GPS signals#Almanac|almanac message (GPS)]].

Although LightSquared had applied for a license to operate in the 1525 to 1559 band as early as 2003 and it was put out for public comment, the FCC asked LightSquared to form a study group with the GPS community to test GPS receivers and identify issue that might arise due to the larger signal power from the LightSquared terrestrial network. The GPS community had not objected to the LightSquared (formerly MSV and SkyTerra) applications until November 2010, when LightSquared applied for a modification to its Ancillary Terrestrial Component (ATC) authorization. This filing (SAT-MOD-20101118-00239) amounted to a request to run several orders of magnitude more power in the same frequency band for terrestrial base stations, essentially repurposing what was supposed to be a \"quiet neighborhood\" for signals from space as the equivalent of a cellular network. Testing in the first half of 2011 has demonstrated that the impact of the lower 10&nbsp;MHz of spectrum is minimal to GPS devices (less than 1% of the total GPS devices are affected). The upper 10&nbsp;MHz intended for use by LightSquared may have some impact on GPS devices. There is some concern that this may seriously degrade the GPS signal for many consumer uses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-system/news/data-shows-disastrous-gps-jamming-fcc-approved-broadcaster-11029?utm_source=GPS&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Navigate_01_31_2011&utm_content=data-shows-disastrous-gps-jamming-fcc-approved-broadcaster-11029 |title=Federal Communications Commission Presented Evidence of GPS Signal Interference |publisher=GPS World |accessdate=November 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011082258/http://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-system/news/data-shows-disastrous-gps-jamming-fcc-approved-broadcaster-11029?utm_source=GPS&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Navigate_01_31_2011&utm_content=data-shows-disastrous-gps-jamming-fcc-approved-broadcaster-11029 |archivedate=October 11, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saveourgps.org/studies-reports.aspx|title=Coalition to Save Our GPS|publisher=Saveourgps.org|accessdate=November 6, 2011}}</ref> [[Aviation Week]] magazine reports that the latest testing (June 2011) confirms \"significant jamming\" of GPS by LightSquared's system.<ref name=\"aviationweek1\">{{cite web|title=LightSquared Tests Confirm GPS Jamming |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/awx/2011/06/09/awx_06_09_2011_p0-334122.xml&headline=LightSquared%20Tests%20Confirm%20GPS%20Jamming&channel=busav |publisher=Aviation Week |accessdate=June 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812045607/http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/awx/2011/06/09/awx_06_09_2011_p0-334122.xml&headline=LightSquared%20Tests%20Confirm%20GPS%20Jamming&channel=busav |archivedate=August 12, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Demodulation and decoding===\n<!-- Demodulation is done with carrier frequency; decoding is done with Gold Code. -->\n\n[[File:gps ca gold.svg|thumb|right|175px|Demodulating and decoding GPS satellite signals|Demodulating and Decoding GPS Satellite Signals using the Coarse<!-- \"Coarse\" is correct, as in \"not precision\"-->/Acquisition [[Gold code]].]]\n\nBecause all of the satellite signals are modulated onto the same L1 carrier frequency, the signals must be separated after demodulation.

If the almanac information is not in memory, the receiver enters a search mode until a lock is obtained on one of the satellites. To obtain a lock, it is necessary that there be an unobstructed line of sight from the receiver to the satellite. The receiver can then acquire the almanac and determine the satellites it should listen for. As it detects each satellite's signal, it identifies it by its distinct C/A&nbsp;code pattern. There can be a delay of up to 30&nbsp;seconds before the first estimate of position because of the need to read the ephemeris data.\n\nProcessing of the navigation message enables the determination of the time of transmission and the satellite position at this time.

The receiver clock bias is the same for all received satellite signals (assuming the satellite clocks are all perfectly synchronized). The message's transit time is {{nobreak|1=''t&#771;<sub>i</sub>'' \u2212 ''b'' \u2212 ''s<sub>i</sub>''}}, where ''s<sub>i</sub>'' is the satellite time.

Geometrical interpretations can enhance the understanding of these solution methods.\n\n====Spheres====\nThe measured ranges, called pseudoranges, contain clock errors.

The locus of points having a constant difference in distance to two points (here, two satellites) is a [[hyperboloid]] (see [[Multilateration]]). Thus, from four or more measured reception times, the receiver can be placed at the intersection of the surfaces of three or more hyperboloids.<ref name=\"Abel1\"/><ref name=\"Fang\"/>\n\n====Spherical cones====\nThe solution space [''x, y, z, b''] can be seen as a four-dimensional geometric space.

A common approach is by iteration on a linearized form of the equations, such as the [[Gauss\u2013Newton algorithm]].\n\nThe GPS system was initially developed assuming use of a numerical least-squares solution method\u2014i.e., before closed-form solutions were found.\n\n====Closed-form====\nOne closed-form solution to the above set of equations was developed by S.

When four satellites are used, the key steps are inversion of a 4x4 matrix and solution of a single-variable quadratic equation. Bancroft's method provides one or two solutions for the unknown quantities. When there are two (usually the case), only one is a near-Earth sensible solution.<ref name=Bancroft />\n\nWhen a receiver uses more than four satellites for a solution, Bancroft uses the [[generalized inverse]] (i.e., the pseudoinverse) to find a solution.

Such augmentation systems are generally named or described based on how the information arrives. Some systems transmit additional error information (such as clock drift, ephemera, or [[ionospheric delay]]), others characterize prior errors, while a third group provides additional navigational or vehicle information.\n\nExamples of augmentation systems include the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS), [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]] (EGNOS), [[Differential GPS]] (DGPS), [[inertial navigation system]]s (INS) and [[Assisted GPS]]. The standard accuracy of about {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} can be augmented to {{convert|3|\u2013|5|m|ft|sp=us}} with DGPS, and to about {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} with WAAS.<ref>{{cite book|title=GPS For Dummies |first1=Joel |last1=McNamara |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2008 |isbn=0-470-45785-6 |page=59 |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=Hbz4LYIrvuMC}}}}, {{google books|plainurl=y|id=Hbz4LYIrvuMC|page=59 |title=Extract of page 59}}</ref>\n\n===Precise monitoring===\nAccuracy can be improved through precise monitoring and measurement of existing GPS signals in additional or alternate ways.\n\nThe largest remaining error is usually the unpredictable delay through the [[ionosphere]]. The spacecraft broadcast ionospheric model parameters, but some errors remain. This is one reason GPS spacecraft transmit on at least two frequencies, L1 and L2. Ionospheric delay is a well-defined function of frequency and the [[total electron content]] (TEC) along the path, so measuring the arrival time difference between the frequencies determines TEC and thus the precise ionospheric delay at each frequency.\n\nMilitary receivers can decode the P(Y) code transmitted on both L1 and L2. Without decryption keys, it is still possible to use a ''codeless'' technique to compare the P(Y) codes on L1 and L2 to gain much of the same error information. However, this technique is slow, so it is currently available only on specialized surveying equipment. In the future, additional civilian codes are expected to be transmitted on the L2 and L5&nbsp;frequencies (see [[GPS modernization]]). All users will then be able to perform dual-frequency measurements and directly compute ionospheric delay errors.\n\nA second form of precise monitoring is called ''Carrier-Phase Enhancement'' (CPGPS). This corrects the error that arises because the pulse transition of the [[pseudorandom noise|PRN]] is not instantaneous, and thus the [[cross-correlation|correlation]] (satellite\u2013receiver sequence matching) operation is imperfect. CPGPS uses the L1 carrier wave, which has a [[frequency|period]] of <math> \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1575.42 \\times 10^6} = 0.63475\\,\\mathrm{ns} \\approx 1\\, \\mathrm{ns} \\ </math>, which is about one-thousandth of the C/A&nbsp;Gold code bit period of <math> \\frac{1\\, \\mathrm{s}}{1023 \\times 10^3} = 977.5 \\, \\mathrm{ns}   \\approx 1000 \\, \\mathrm{ns} \\ </math>, to act as an additional [[clock signal]] and resolve the uncertainty. The phase difference error in the normal GPS amounts to {{convert|2|\u2013|3|m|ft|sp=us|sigfig=1}} of ambiguity. CPGPS working to within 1% of perfect transition reduces this error to {{convert|3|cm|in|sp=us}} of ambiguity. By eliminating this error source, CPGPS coupled with DGPS normally realizes between {{convert|20|\u2013|30|cm|in|0|sp=us}} of absolute accuracy.\n\n''[[Relative Kinematic Positioning]]'' (RKP) is a third alternative for a precise GPS-based positioning system. In this approach, determination of range signal can be resolved to a precision of less than {{convert|10|cm|in|0|sp=us}}. This is done by resolving the number of cycles that the signal is transmitted and received by the receiver by using a combination of differential GPS (DGPS) correction data, transmitting GPS signal phase information and ambiguity resolution techniques via statistical tests\u2014possibly with processing in real-time ([[Real Time Kinematic|real-time kinematic positioning]], RTK).\n\n===Timekeeping {{anchor|GPS time|GPS time and date}}===\n\n====Leap seconds====\nWhile most clocks derive their time from [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), the atomic clocks on the satellites are set to GPS time (GPST; see the page of [[United States Naval Observatory]]). The difference is that GPS time is not corrected to match the rotation of the Earth, so it does not contain [[leap second]]s or other corrections that are periodically added to UTC. GPS time was set to match UTC in 1980, but has since diverged. The lack of corrections means that GPS time remains at a constant offset with [[International Atomic Time]] (TAI) (TAI \u2212 GPS = 19&nbsp;seconds). Periodic corrections are performed to the on-board clocks to keep them synchronized with ground clocks.<ref>{{cite web|title=NAVSTAR GPS User Equipment Introduction|format=PDF|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/gps/gpsuser/gpsuser.pdf }} Section 1.2.2</ref>\n\nThe GPS navigation message includes the difference between GPS time and UTC.

The week number is transmitted as a ten-[[bit]] field in the C/A and P(Y) navigation messages, and so it becomes zero again every 1,024&nbsp;weeks (19.6&nbsp;years). GPS week zero started at 00:00:00&nbsp;UTC (00:00:19&nbsp;TAI) on January 6, 1980, and the week number became zero again for the first time at 23:59:47&nbsp;UTC on August 21, 1999 (00:00:19&nbsp;TAI on August 22, 1999). To determine the current Gregorian date, a GPS receiver must be provided with the approximate date (to within 3,584&nbsp;days) to correctly translate the GPS date signal. To address this concern the modernized GPS navigation message uses a 13-bit field that only repeats every 8,192&nbsp;weeks (157&nbsp;years), thus lasting until the year 2137 (157&nbsp;years after GPS week zero).\n\n===Carrier phase tracking (surveying)===\nAnother method that is used in surveying applications is carrier phase tracking. The period of the carrier frequency multiplied by the speed of light gives the wavelength, which is about 0.19&nbsp;meters for the L1&nbsp;carrier. Accuracy within 1% of wavelength in detecting the leading edge reduces this component of pseudorange error to as little as 2&nbsp;millimeters. This compares to 3&nbsp;meters for the C/A code and 0.3&nbsp;meters for the P&nbsp;code.\n\nHowever, 2&nbsp;millimeter accuracy requires measuring the total phase\u2014the number of waves multiplied by the wavelength plus the fractional wavelength, which requires specially equipped receivers. This method has many surveying applications. It is accurate enough for real-time tracking of the very slow motions of [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]], typically {{convert|0|-|100|mm|in|0|abbr=in}} per year.\n\nTriple differencing followed by numerical root finding, and a mathematical technique called [[least squares]] can estimate the position of one receiver given the position of another. First, compute the difference between satellites, then between receivers, and finally between epochs. Other orders of taking differences are equally valid. Detailed discussion of the errors is omitted.\n\nThe satellite carrier total phase can be measured with ambiguity as to the number of cycles. Let <math>\\ \\phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> denote the phase of the carrier of satellite ''j'' measured by receiver ''i'' at time <math>\\ \\ t_k </math>. This notation shows the meaning of the subscripts ''i, j,'' and ''k.'' The receiver (''r''), satellite (''s''), and time (''t'') come in alphabetical order as arguments of <math>\\ \\phi </math> and to balance readability and conciseness, let <math>\\ \\phi_{i,j,k} = \\phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> be a concise abbreviation. Also we define three functions, :<math>\\ \\Delta^r, \\Delta^s, \\Delta^t </math>, which return differences between receivers, satellites, and time points, respectively. Each function has variables with three subscripts as its arguments. These three functions are defined below. If <math>\\  \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math> is a function of the three integer arguments, ''i, j,'' and ''k'' then it is a valid argument for the functions, :<math>\\ \\Delta^r, \\Delta^s, \\Delta^t </math>, with the values defined as\n\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^r(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \\alpha_{i+1,j,k} - \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math>,\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^s(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \\alpha_{i,j+1,k} - \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math>, and\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^t(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \\alpha_{i,j,k+1} - \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math>&nbsp;.\n\nAlso if <math>\\  \\alpha_{i,j,k}\\ and\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} </math> are valid arguments for the three functions and ''a'' and ''b'' are constants then\n<math>\\ ( a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} ) </math> is a valid argument with values defined as\n\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^r(a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n}) = a \\ \\Delta^r(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \\ \\Delta^r(\\beta_{l,m,n})</math>,\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^s(a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} )= a \\ \\Delta^s(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \\ \\Delta^s(\\beta_{l,m,n})</math>, and\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^t(a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} )= a \\ \\Delta^t(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \\ \\Delta^t(\\beta_{l,m,n})</math>&nbsp;.\n\nReceiver clock errors can be approximately eliminated by differencing the phases measured from satellite&nbsp;1 with that from satellite&nbsp;2 at the same epoch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/633.htm|title=Between-Satellite Differencing|publisher=Gmat.unsw.edu.au|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}</ref> This difference is designated as <math>\\ \\Delta^s(\\phi_{1,1,1}) =  \\phi_{1,2,1} - \\phi_{1,1,1}</math>\n\nDouble differencing<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/635.htm|title=Double differencing|publisher=Gmat.unsw.edu.au|accessdate=October 15, 2010}}</ref> computes the difference of receiver&nbsp;1's satellite difference from that of receiver&nbsp;2.

This eliminates the ambiguity associated with the integral number of wavelengths in carrier phase provided this ambiguity does not change with time. Thus the triple difference result eliminates practically all clock bias errors and the integer ambiguity. Atmospheric delay and satellite ephemeris errors have been significantly reduced. This triple difference is:\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^t(\\Delta^r(\\Delta^s(\\phi_{1,1,1}))) </math>\n\nTriple difference results can be used to estimate unknown variables. For example, if the position of receiver&nbsp;1 is known but the position of receiver&nbsp;2 unknown, it may be possible to estimate the position of receiver&nbsp;2 using numerical root finding and least squares. Triple difference results for three independent time pairs may be sufficient to solve for receiver&nbsp;2's three position components. This may require a numerical procedure.<ref name=\"NR1\">chapter on root finding and nonlinear sets of equations</ref><ref>{{cite book|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=UQW_VL2H56IC|page=959}}|title=Preview of Root Finding|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=October 15, 2010|isbn=978-0-521-88068-8|year=2007}}</ref> An approximation of receiver&nbsp;2's position is required to use such a numerical method. This initial value can probably be provided from the navigation message and the intersection of sphere surfaces. Such a reasonable estimate can be key to successful multidimensional root finding. Iterating from three time pairs and a fairly good initial value produces one observed triple difference result for receiver&nbsp;2's position. Processing additional time pairs can improve accuracy, overdetermining the answer with multiple solutions. Least squares can estimate an overdetermined system. Least squares determines the position of receiver&nbsp;2 that best fits the observed triple difference results for receiver&nbsp;2 positions under the criterion of minimizing the sum of the squares.\n\n==Regulatory spectrum issues concerning GPS receivers==\nIn the United States, GPS receivers are regulated under the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s (FCC) [[Title 47 CFR Part 15|Part 15]] rules.
