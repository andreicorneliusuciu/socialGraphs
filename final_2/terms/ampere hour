The latter is commonly used for marketing purposes, but it does not express the real capacity of a battery.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nA ''milliampere second'' (mA\u00b7s) is also a unit of measure used in [[X-ray imaging]], diagnostic imaging, and [[radiation therapy]]. This quantity is proportional to the total X-ray energy produced by a given X-ray tube operated at a particular voltage.<ref>[http://www.ehss.vt.edu/Programs/RSD/Xray/xray09.htm X-ray Safety Handbook, 9.0 Terms and Definitions, VirginiaTech Environmental, Health and Safety Services] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070723051053/http://www.ehss.vt.edu/Programs/RSD/Xray/xray09.htm |date=July 23, 2007 }}</ref> The same total dose can be delivered in different time periods depending on the X-ray tube current.\n\nAn ampere hour is not a [[Units of energy#Electricity|unit of energy]]. In a battery system, for example, accurate calculation of the energy delivered requires integration of the power delivered (product of instantaneous voltage and instantaneous current) over the discharge interval. Generally, the battery voltage varies during discharge; an average value or nominal value may be used to approximate the integration of power.<ref>{{cite book |author=National Research Council (U.S.) |title=Meeting the energy needs of future warriors |publisher=National Academies Press |year=2004  |isbn=0-309-09261-2 |page=27 }}</ref>\n\n== Other measures of electric charge ==\n\nThe [[Faraday constant]] is the charge on one [[mole (unit)|mole]] of electrons, approximately equal to 26.8&nbsp;ampere hours. It is used in electrochemical calculations.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n* An [[List of battery sizes|AA size]] [[dry cell]] has a capacity of about 2 to 3 ampere hours.\n* Automotive [[car battery|car batteries]] vary in capacity but a large automobile propelled by an internal combustion engine would have about a 50 ampere hour battery capacity.\n* Since one ampere hour can produce 0.336 grams of aluminium from molten aluminium chloride, producing a ton of aluminium requires transfer of at least 2.98 million ampere hours. <ref> T.
