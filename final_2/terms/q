It is a [[consonant]], not a [[vowel]].\n\n==History==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=4\n|- bgcolor=\"#0000FF\"\n! Egyptian hieroglyph <br/> ''wj''\n! Phoenician <br/> ''[[qoph]]''\n! [[Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan]]<br> Q\n! Greek <br/> ''[[Koppa (letter)|Qoppa]]''\n|--- align=center\n|<hiero>V24</hiero>\n| [[Image:PhoenicianQ-01.png|x30px]]\n| [[Image:EtruscanQ-01.svg|x30px]]\n| [[Image:GreekQ-01.png|x30px]]\n|}\n\nThe [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] sound value of [[Qoph|Q\u00f4p]] (perhaps originally ''qaw'', \"cord of wool\", and possibly based on an [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]) was {{IPA|/q/}} ([[voiceless uvular stop]]), a sound common to Semitic languages, but not found in English or most {{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Indo-European ones. In [[Greek language|Greek]], this sign as [[Koppa (letter)|Qoppa]] \u03d8 probably came to represent several [[Labialized velar consonant|labialized velar]] [[stop consonant|stop]]s, among them {{IPA|/k\u02b7/}} and {{IPA|/k\u02b7\u02b0/}}. As a result of later sound shifts, these sounds in Greek changed to {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}} respectively. Therefore, Qoppa was transformed into two letters: Qoppa, which stood for a number only, and [[Phi (letter)|Phi]] \u03a6 which stood for the aspirated sound {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}} that came to be pronounced {{IPA|/f/}} in Modern Greek.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn the earliest [[Latin]] inscriptions, the letters C, K and Q were all used to represent the two sounds {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, which were not differentiated in writing. Of these, Q was used before a rounded vowel (e.g. {{angbr|EQO}} 'ego'), K before /a/, and C elsewhere. Later, the use of C (and its variant G) replaced most usages of K and Q: Q survived only to represent /k/ when immediately followed by a /w/ sound.<ref>{{citation \n|title=New Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin\n|first=Andrew L.\n|last=Sihler\n|edition=illustrated\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|year=1995\n|location=New York\n|isbn=0-19-508345-8\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IeHmqKY2BqoC\n|pages=21\n}}</ref>\nThe [[Etruscans]] used Q in conjunction with V to represent {{IPA|/k\u02b7/}}.\n\n==Use in writing systems==\n\n===English===\nIn [[English language|English]], the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] {{angbr|qu}} most often denotes the cluster {{IPAc-en|k|w}}; however, in borrowings from French, it represents {{IPAc-en|k}}, as in 'plaque'. See the [[list of English words containing Q not followed by U]]. {{angbr|q}} is the second-least-common letter in the English language, with a frequency of just 0.09% in words. Only {{angbr|z}} occurs less often.\n\n===Other languages===\nIn most European languages written in the Latin script, such as in [[Romance language|Romance]] and [[Germanic languages]], {{angbr|q}} appears almost exclusively in the digraph {{angbr|qu}}. Notable exceptions to this are [[Albanian language|Albanian]], in which {{angbr|q}} represents the [[voiceless palatal stop]] {{IPA|[c]}}, and [[Maltese language|Maltese]] and [[V\u00f5ro language|V\u00f5ro]], which use it to represent the [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[\u0294]}}. In [[French language|French]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], {{angbr|qu}} represents {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/kw/}}; in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], it represents {{IPA|/k/}}. {{angbr|qu}} replaces {{angbr|[[c]]}} for {{IPA|/k/}} before front vowels {{angbr|i}} and {{angbr|e}}, since in those languages {{angbr|c}} represents a fricative or affricate before front vowels. In [[Italian language|Italian]] {{angbr|qu}} represents {{IPA|[kw]}} (where {{IPA|[w]}} is the [[semivowel]] allophone of {{IPA|/u/}}).\n\nIt is not considered to be part of the [[Gaj's Latin alphabet|Bosnian]], [[Gaj's Latin alphabet|Croatian]], [[Estonian orthography|Estonian]], [[Icelandic alphabet|Icelandic]], [[Irish alphabet|Irish]], [[Latvian alphabet|Latvian]], [[Lithuanian orthography|Lithuanian]], [[Polish alphabet|Polish]], [[Scottish Gaelic orthography|Scottish Gaelic]], [[Slovene alphabet|Slovenian]], [[Turkish alphabet|Turkish]], or [[Welsh alphabet|Welsh]] alphabet.\n\n{{angbr|q}} has a wide variety of pronunciations among non-European languages that have adopted the Latin alphabet. It has the value {{IPA|/q/}} in [[Aymara language|Aymara]], [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]], [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]], [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] and [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]]. In [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], {{angbr|q}} stands for a [[voiced velar stop]] {{IPA|[\u0261]}}. In [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[Hanyu Pinyin]], {{angbr|q}} is used to represent the sound {{IPA|[t\u0255\u02b0]}}, which is close to English {{angbr|ch}} in \"cheese\", but pronounced further toward the front of the mouth. {{angbr|q}} in [[Fijian language|Fijian]] has the value of a [[Prenasalized consonant|prenasalized]] [[voiced velar stop]] {{IPA|[\u014b\u0261]}}. In [[Kiowa language|Kiowa]], {{angbr|q}} represents a glottalized velar stop {{IPA|[k\u02bc]}}. In [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]], {{angbr|q}} is used for the [[postalveolar click]] {{IPA|[k\u01c3]}}. In transliteration of [[Classical Mongolian]], {{angbr|q}} represents a [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|[x]}}.\n\n===Other systems===\nThe [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] uses {{angbr|{{IPA|q}}}} for the [[voiceless uvular stop]].\n\n==Other uses==\nThe [[Roman numeral]] Q is sometimes used to represent the number 500,000.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywI6SDUggk4C&q=ix#v=snippet&q=%22roman%20numerals%22&f=false | title=Illustrated Introduction to Latin Epigraphy | publisher=University of California Press | date=1983 | accessdate=3 October 2015 | author=Gordon, Arthur E. | pages=44| isbn=9780520038981 }}</ref>\n\n==Forms and variants==\n[[File:Q and g comparison.svg|thumb|right|150px|A comparison of the [[glyph]]s of {{angbr|q}} and {{angbr|g}}.]] <!-- This image belongs with the text below, but is placed here so that it does not run over the bottom of the section -->\n\n<!-- See above for relevant image -->\nThe lowercase Q (q) is usually seen as a lowercase O with a descender (i.e., downward vertical tail) extending from the right side of the bowl, with or without a swash (i.e., flourish), even a reversed lowercase [[p]]. The lowercase Q's descender is usually typed without a swash due to the major style difference typically seen between the descenders of the lowercase G (a loop) and lowercase Q (vertical). The descender of the lowercase Q is sometimes handwritten finishing with a rightward swash to distinguish from the leftward facing curved descender on the lowercase G or the number 9.\n\n==Related characters==\n<!-- Please only list characters (symbols in a writing system, but not just convenience codepoints in Unicode) that are actually related in terms of origin to the letter that is the topic of this article.
