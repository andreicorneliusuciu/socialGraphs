This specification under the marketing name of [[Wi-Fi]] has been implemented all over the world.  The 802.11g protocol is now Clause 19 of the published [[IEEE 802.11-2007#802.11-2007|IEEE 802.11-2007]] standard, and Clause 19 of the published [[IEEE 802.11#802.11-2012|IEEE 802.11-2012]] standard.\n\n[[802.11]] is a set of [[IEEE]] standards that govern wireless networking transmission methods. They are commonly used today in their [[802.11a]], [[802.11b]], 802.11g, [[802.11n]] and [[802.11ac]] versions to provide wireless connectivity in the home, office and some commercial establishments.\n\n== Descriptions ==\n802.11g is the third modulation standard for [[wireless LAN]]s.  It works in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band (like [[802.11b]]) but operates at a maximum raw data rate of 54 Mbit/s. Using the CSMA/CA transmission scheme, 31.4 Mbit/s<ref name=\"Theoretical Maximum Throughput of IEEE 802.11 and its Applications\" /> is the maximum net [[throughput]] possible for packets of 1500 bytes in size and a 54 Mbit/s wireless rate (identical to [[802.11a]] core, except for some additional legacy overhead for backward compatibility). In practice, access points may not have an ideal implementation and may therefore not be able to achieve even 31.4 Mbit/s throughput with 1500 byte packets. 1500 bytes is the usual limit for packets on the Internet and therefore a relevant size to benchmark against. Smaller packets give even lower theoretical throughput, down to 3 Mbit/s using 54 Mbit/s rate and 64 byte packets.<ref name=\"Theoretical Maximum Throughput of IEEE 802.11 and its Applications\" /> Also, the available throughput is shared between all stations transmitting, including the AP so both downstream and upstream traffic is limited to a shared total of 31.4 Mbit/s using 1500 byte packets and 54 Mbit/s rate.\n\n802.11g hardware is fully backwards compatible with 802.11b hardware. Details of making b and g work well together occupied much of the lingering technical process. In an 802.11g network, however, the presence of a legacy 802.11b participant will significantly reduce the speed of the overall 802.11g network. Some 802.11g routers employ a back-compatible mode for 802.11b clients called 54g LRS (Limited Rate Support).\n\nThe modulation scheme used in 802.11g is [[orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]] (OFDM) copied from 802.11a with data rates of 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbit/s, and reverts to [[Complementary code keying|CCK]] (like the 802.11b standard) for 5.5 and 11 Mbit/s and [[Phase-shift keying|DBPSK]]/[[Phase-shift keying|DQPSK]]+[[DSSS]] for 1 and 2 Mbit/s.  Even though 802.11g operates in the same frequency band as 802.11b, it can achieve higher data rates because of its heritage to 802.11a.\n\n== Technical description ==\nOf the 52 OFDM subcarriers, 48 are for data and 4 are [[pilot signal|pilot subcarrier]]s with a carrier separation of 0.3125&nbsp;MHz (20&nbsp;MHz/64). Each of these subcarriers can be a [[phase-shift keying|BPSK]], [[phase-shift keying|QPSK]], 16-[[QAM]] or 64-[[QAM]]. The total bandwidth is 20&nbsp;MHz with an occupied bandwidth of 16.6&nbsp;MHz. Symbol duration is 4 [[microsecond]]s, which ''includes'' a guard interval of 0.8 microseconds. The actual generation and decoding of orthogonal components is done in baseband using DSP which is then upconverted to 2.4&nbsp;GHz at the transmitter. Each of the subcarriers could be represented as a complex number. The time domain signal is generated by taking an Inverse [[Fast Fourier transform]] (IFFT). Correspondingly the receiver downconverts, samples at 20&nbsp;MHz and does an FFT to retrieve the original coefficients. The advantages of using [[OFDM]] include reduced multipath effects in reception and increased spectral efficiency.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! [[Modulation and coding scheme|MCS index]]\n!

By summer 2003, most dual-band 802.11a/b products became dual-band/tri-mode, supporting a and b/g in a single mobile adapter card or access point.\n\nDespite its major acceptance, 802.11g suffers from the same interference as 802.11b in the already crowded 2.4&nbsp;GHz range.  Devices operating in this range include microwave ovens, [[Bluetooth]] devices, baby monitors and digital cordless telephones, which can lead to interference issues.  Additionally, the success of the standard has caused usage/density problems related to crowding in urban areas.  To prevent interference, there are only three non-overlapping usable channels in the U.S. and other countries with similar regulations (channels 1, 6, 11, with 25&nbsp;MHz separation), and four in Europe (channels 1, 5, 9, 13, with only 20&nbsp;MHz separation). Even with such separation, some interference due to [[side lobe]]s exists, though it is considerably weaker.\n\n==Channels and frequencies==\n[[Image:2.4 GHz Wi-Fi channels (802.11b,g WLAN).svg|thumb|upright=3.75|802.11b/g channels in 2.4 GHz band]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ IEEE 802.11g channel to frequency map <ref>http://download.wcvirtual.com/reference/802%20Channel%20Freq%20Mappings.pdf</ref>\n|-\n!
