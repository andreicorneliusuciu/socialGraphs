By contrast, DER systems are decentralized, modular and more flexible technologies, that are located close to the load they serve, albeit having capacities of only 10 [[megawatt]]s (MW) or less. These systems can comprise  multiple generation and storage components. In this instance they are referred to as [[Hybrid power]] systems. \n\nDER systems typically use [[renewable energy]] sources, including [[small hydro]], [[biomass]], [[biogas]], [[solar power]], [[wind power]], and [[geothermal power]], and increasingly play an important role for the [[electric power distribution]] system. A grid-connected device for [[Grid energy storage|electricity storage]] can also be classified as a DER system, and is often called a '''distributed energy storage system''' ('''DESS'''). By means of an interface, DER systems can be managed and coordinated within a [[smart grid]]. Distributed generation and storage enables collection of energy from many sources and may lower environmental impacts and improve security of supply.\n\n'''[[Microgrids]]''' are modern, localized, small-scale grids, contrary to the traditional, centralized [[electricity grid]] (macrogrid). Microgrids can disconnect from the centralized grid and operate autonomously, strengthen grid resilience and help mitigate grid disturbances. They are typically low-voltage AC grids, often use [[diesel generator]]s, and are installed by the community they serve. Microgrids increasingly employ a mixture of different distributed energy resources, such as [[solar hybrid power systems]], which reduce the amount of emitted carbon significantly.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Overview ==\n\nHistorically, central plants have been an integral part of the electric grid, in which large generating facilities are specifically located either close to resources or otherwise located far from populated load centers. These, in turn, supply the traditional transmission and distribution (T&D) grid that distributes bulk power to load centers and from there to consumers. These were developed when the costs of transporting fuel and integrating generating technologies into populated areas far exceeded the cost of developing T&D facilities and tariffs. Central plants are usually designed to take advantage of available economies of scale in a site-specific manner, and are built as \"one-off,\" custom projects.\n\nThese [[economies of scale]] began to fail in the late 1960s and, by the start of the 21st century, Central Plants could arguably no longer deliver competitively cheap and reliable electricity to more remote customers through the grid, because the plants had come to cost less than the grid and had become so reliable that nearly all power failures originated in the grid. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Thus, the grid had become the main driver of remote customers\u2019 power costs and power quality problems, which became more acute as digital equipment required extremely reliable electricity.<ref name=\"DOE 2007\">DOE; The Potential Benefits of Distributed Generation and Rate-Related Issues that May Impede Their Expansion; 2007.</ref><ref>Lovins; Small Is Profitable: The Hidden Economic Benefits of Making Electrical Resources the Right Size; Rocky Mountain Institute, 2002.</ref> Efficiency gains no longer come from increasing generating capacity, but from smaller units located closer to sites of demand.<ref>Takahashi, et al; Policy Options to Support Distributed Resources; U. of Del., Ctr. for Energy & Env. Policy; 2005.</ref><ref>Hirsch; 1989; cited in DOE, 2007.</ref>\n\nFor example, coal power plants are built away from cities to prevent their heavy air pollution from affecting the populace. In addition, such plants are often built near [[Colliery|collieries]] to minimize the cost of transporting coal. [[Hydroelectricity|Hydroelectric]] plants are by their nature limited to operating at sites with sufficient water flow.\n\nLow pollution is a crucial advantage of combined cycle plants that burn [[natural gas]]. The low pollution permits the plants to be near enough to a city to provide [[district heating]] and cooling.\n\nDistributed energy resources are mass-produced, small, and less site-specific. Their development arose out of:\n# concerns over perceived externalized costs of central plant generation, particularly environmental concerns,\n# the increasing age, deterioration, and capacity constraints upon T&D for bulk power;\n# the increasing relative economy of mass production of smaller appliances over heavy manufacturing of larger units and on-site construction;\n# Along with higher relative prices for energy, higher overall complexity and total costs for regulatory oversight, tariff administration, and metering and billing.\n\nCapital markets have come to realize that right-sized resources, for individual customers, distribution substations, or microgrids, are able to offer important but little-known economic advantages over central plants. Smaller units offered greater economies from mass-production than big ones could gain through unit size. These increased value\u2014due to improvements in financial risk, engineering flexibility, security, and environmental quality\u2014of these resources can often more than offset their apparent cost disadvantages.<ref>Lovins; Small Is Profitable: The Hidden Economic Benefits of Making Electrical Resources the Right Size; Rocky Mountain Institute; 2002</ref> DG, vis-\u00e0-vis central plants, must be justified on a life-cycle basis.<ref>Michigan (Citation pending)</ref> Unfortunately, many of the direct, and virtually all of the indirect, benefits of DG are not captured within traditional utility cash-flow accounting.<ref name=\"DOE 2007\"/>\n\nWhile the [[levelized cost of electricity|levelized cost]] of distributed generation (DG) is typically more expensive than conventional, centralized sources on a kilowatt-hour basis, this does not consider negative aspects of conventional fuels. The additional premium for DG is rapidly declining as demand increases and technology progresses,{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} and sufficient and reliable demand may bring economies of scale, innovation, competition, and more flexible financing, that could make DG clean energy part of a more diversified future.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} <!-- O come on! POV, anyone? -->\n\nDistributed generation reduces the amount of energy lost in transmitting electricity because the electricity is generated very near where it is used, perhaps even in the same building. This also reduces the size and number of power lines that must be constructed.\n\nTypical DER systems in a [[feed-in tariff]] (FIT) scheme have low maintenance, low pollution and high efficiencies. In the past, these traits required dedicated operating engineers and large complex plants to reduce pollution. However, modern [[embedded system]]s can provide these traits with automated operation and [[renewable energy|renewables]], such as sunlight, wind and [[geothermal]]. This reduces the size of power plant that can show a profit.\n\n=== Grid parity ===\n\n[[Grid parity]] occurs when an [[alternative energy]] source can generate electricity at a levelized cost ([[LCOE]]) that is less than or equal to the end consumer's retail price. Reaching grid parity is considered to be the point at which an energy source becomes a contender for widespread development without [[subsidy|subsidies]] or government support. Since the 2010s, grid parity for solar and wind has become a reality in a growing number of markets, including Australia, several European countries, and some states in the U.S.<ref name=wp-grid-parity-2014>{{cite web\n|last1=McFarland|first1=Matt\n|title=Grid parity: Why electric utilities should struggle to sleep at night\n|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2014/03/25/grid-parity-why-electric-utilities-should-struggle-to-sleep-at-night/\n|website=http://www.washingtonpost.com/\n|publisher=Washingtonpost.com\n|accessdate=14 September 2014\n|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6SaEzv1eJ|archivedate=14 September 2014\n|date=25 March 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n== Technologies ==\n\nDistributed energy resource ('''DER''') systems are small-scale power generation or storage technologies (typically in the range of 1&nbsp;kW to 10,000&nbsp;kW)<ref name=nrel-using-der>{{cite web\n|title=Using Distributed Energy Resources\n|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy02osti/31570.pdf\n|website=http://www.nrel.gov\n|publisher=NREL\n|accessdate=8 September 2014\n|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6SQK0RpAc\n|archivedate=8 September 2014\n|page=1\n|year=2002\n}}</ref> used to provide an alternative to or an enhancement of the traditional electric power system.

These have low maintenance and low pollution, but distributed wind unlike utility-scale wind has much higher costs than other sources of energy.<ref>{{Cite web|title = NREL: Energy Analysis - Distributed Generation Energy Technology Capital Costs|url = http://www.nrel.gov/analysis/tech_cost_dg.html|website = www.nrel.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}</ref> As with solar, wind energy is variable and non-dispatchable. Wind towers and generators have substantial insurable liabilities caused by high winds, but good operating safety. Distributed generation from [[wind hybrid power systems]] combines wind power with other DER systems. One such example is the integration of wind turbines into [[solar hybrid power systems]], as wind tends to complement solar because the peak operating times for each system occur at different times of the day and year.\n\n=== Hydro power ===\n{{main article|Small hydro|Wave power}}\n\nHydroelectricity is the most widely used form of renewable energy and its potential has already been explored to a large extent or is compromised due to issues such as environmental impacts on fisheries, and increased demand for recreational access. However, using modern 21st century technology, such as [[wave power]], can make large amounts of new hydropower capacity available, with minor environmental impact.\n\nModular and scalable ''Next generation kinetic energy turbines'' can be deployed in arrays to serve the needs on a residential, commercial, industrial, municipal or even regional scale. ''Microhydro kinetic generators'' neither require dams nor impoundments, as they utilize the kinetic energy of water motion, either waves or flow. No construction is needed on the shoreline or sea bed, which minimizes environmental impacts to habitats and simplifies the permitting process. Such power generation also has minimal environmental impact and non-traditional microhydro applications can be tethered to existing construction such as docks, piers, bridge abutments, or similar structures.<ref>http://www.academia.edu, Janet Marsdon [http://www.academia.edu/446324/Distributed_Generation_Systems_A_New_Paradigm_for_Sustainable_Energy Distributed Generation Systems:A New Paradigm for Sustainable Energy], pp. 8, 9</ref>\n\n=== Waste-to-energy ===\n{{main article|Waste-to-energy|Waste-to-energy plant}}\n\nMunicipal solid waste (MSW) and natural waste, such as sewage sludge, food waste and animal manure will decompose and discharge methane-containing gas that can be collected and used as fuel in gas turbines or micro turbines to produce electricity as a distributed energy resource. Additionally, a California-based company, Gate 5 Energy Partners, Inc. has developed a process that transforms natural waste materials, such as sewage sludge, into biofuel that can be combusted to power a steam turbine that produces power.

Compared to the other types, lead-acid batteries have a shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, due to their high reliability, low [[self-discharge]] (4\u20136% per year) as well as low investment and maintenance costs, they are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, as lithium-ion batteries are still being developed and about 3.5 times as expensive as lead-acid batteries.

Finally, another necessary method of aiding in integration of photovoltaics for proper distributed generation is in the use of [[intelligent hybrid inverter]]s.\n\nAnother approach does not demand grid integration: stand alone hybrid systems.\n\n== Stand alone hybrid systems ==\nIt is now possible to combine technologies such as [[photovoltaics]], [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and [[cogen]] to make stand alone distributed generation systems.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Shah | first1 = Kunal K. | last2 = Mundada | first2 = Aishwarya S. | last3 = Pearce | first3 = Joshua M. | year = 2015 | title = Performance of U.S. hybrid distributed energy systems: Solar photovoltaic, battery and combined heat and power | url = https://www.academia.edu/14674492/Performance_of_U.S._hybrid_distributed_energy_systems_Solar_photovoltaic_battery_and_combined_heat_and_power | journal = Energy Conversion and Management | volume = 105 | issue = | pages = 71\u201380 | doi = 10.1016/j.enconman.2015.07.048 }}</ref>\n\nRecent work has shown that such systems have a low [[levelized cost of electricity]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mundada | first1 = Aishwarya | last2 = Shah | first2 = Kunal | last3 = Pearce | first3 = Joshua M. | year = 2016 | title = Levelized cost of electricity for solar photovoltaic, battery and cogen hybrid systems | url = https://www.academia.edu/20141118/Levelized_cost_of_electricity_for_solar_photovoltaic_battery_and_cogen_hybrid_systems | journal = Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 692\u2013703 | doi=10.1016/j.rser.2015.12.084}}</ref>\n\nMany authors now think that these technologies may enable a mass-scale [[grid defection]] because consumers can produce electricity using [[off grid]] systems primarily made up of [[solar photovoltaic]] technology.<ref>Kumagai, J., 2014.

Local production has no [[Losses in electrical systems|electricity transmission losses]] on long distance [[power line]]s or energy losses from the [[Joule effect]] in transformers where in general 8-15% of the energy is lost<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.schneider-electric.com/energy-management-energy-efficiency/2013/03/25/how-big-are-power-line-losses/|title=How big are Power line losses?|work=Schneider Electric Blog|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref> (see also [[cost of electricity by source]]).\n\nSome larger installations utilize combined cycle generation. Usually this consists of a [[gas turbine]] whose exhaust boils [[water]] for a [[steam turbine]] in a [[Rankine cycle]]. The condenser of the steam cycle provides the heat for space heating or an absorptive [[chiller]]. Combined cycle plants with cogeneration have the highest known thermal efficiencies, often exceeding 85%.\n\nIn countries with high pressure gas distribution, small turbines can be used to bring the gas pressure to domestic levels whilst extracting useful energy. If the UK were to implement this countrywide an additional 2-4&nbsp;GWe would become available. (Note that the energy is already being generated elsewhere to provide the high initial gas pressure - this method simply distributes the energy via a different route.)\n\n== Microgrid ==\n[[File:Microgrid.jpg|thumb|400px|Picture of a local microgrid, the Sendai Microgrid, located on the campus of Tohoku Fukushi University in Sendai City in the Tohoku district in Japan]]\n\nA ''microgrid'' is a localized grouping of electricity generation, energy storage, and loads that normally operates connected to a traditional centralized grid ([[electrical grid|macrogrid]]). This single point of common coupling with the macrogrid can be disconnected. The microgrid can then function autonomously.<ref>Stan Mark Kaplan, Fred Sissine, (ed.) ''Smart grid: modernizing electric power transmission and distribution...'' The Capitol Net Inc, 2009, ISBN 1-58733-162-4, page 217</ref> Generation and loads in a microgrid are usually interconnected at low voltage and it can operate in DC, AC or the combination of both. According to the recent developments in renewable energy systems, storage systems, and the nature of newly emerging loads,  there have been some researches for comparing the efficiency and performance of AC and DC microgrids.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Rationale for the use of DC microgrids: feasibility, efficiency and protection analysis|url = http://library.witpress.com/viewpaper.asp?pcode=ESS14-006-1|journal = Energy and Sustainability V: Special Contributions|doi = 10.2495/ess140061|first = M.|last = Seyedmahmoudian|first2 = H.|last2 = Arrisoy|first3 = I.|last3 = Kavalchuk|first4 = A.

The multiple dispersed generation sources and ability to isolate the microgrid from a larger network would provide highly reliable electric power. Produced heat from generation sources such as microturbines could be used for local process heating or space heating, allowing flexible trade off between the needs for heat and electric power.\n\nMicro-grids were proposed in the wake of the [[July 2012 India blackout]]:<ref name=\"moneycontrol\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/smementor/mentorade/starting-up/power-crisisgrid-collapse-is-it-time-to-think--739976.html|title=Power crisis and grid collapse: Is it time to think|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref>\n* Small micro-grids covering 30\u201350&nbsp;km radius<ref name=\"moneycontrol\"/>\n* Small power stations of 5\u201310&nbsp;MW to serve the micro-grids\n* Generate power locally to reduce dependence on long distance transmission lines and cut transmission losses.\n\nGTM Research forecasts microgrid capacity in the United States will exceed 1.8 gigawatts by 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/US-Microgrid-Capacity-Will-Exceed-1.8-GW-by-2018|title=US Microgrid Capacity Will Exceed 1.8GW by 2018|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Communication in DER systems ==\n\n* [[IEC 61850]]-7-420 is under development as a part of IEC 61850 standards, which deals with the complete object models as required for DER systems.
