Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100&nbsp;pm (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale).<ref name=Ghosh02/> However, atoms do not have well-defined boundaries, and there are different ways to [[#Shape and size|define their size]] that give different but close values.\n\nAtoms [[Matter wave#The de Broglie hypothesis|are small enough]] that attempting to predict their behavior using classical physics - as if they were billiard balls, for example - gives noticeably incorrect predictions due to [[quantum mechanics|quantum effects]]. Through the development of physics, atomic models have incorporated [[#Further developments in quantum physics|quantum principles]] to better explain and predict the behavior.\n\nEvery atom is composed of a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] and one or more [[electron]]s bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made of one or more [[proton]]s and typically a similar number of [[neutron]]s. Protons and neutrons are called [[nucleon]]s. More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive [[electric charge]], the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, that atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively, and it is called an [[ion]].\n\nThe electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by this [[electromagnetic force]]. The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by a different force, the [[nuclear force]], which is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force repelling the positively charged protons from one another. Under certain circumstances the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force, and nucleons can be ejected from the nucleus, leaving behind a different element: [[nuclear decay]] resulting in [[nuclear transmutation]].\n\nThe number of protons in the nucleus defines to what [[chemical element]] the atom belongs: for example, all [[copper]] atoms contain 29 protons. The number of neutrons defines the [[isotope]] of the element.<ref name=leigh1990/> The number of electrons influences the [[magnetic]] properties of an atom. Atoms can attach to one or more other atoms by [[chemical bond]]s to form [[chemical compounds]] such as [[molecule]]s. The ability of atoms to associate and dissociate is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature, and is the subject of the discipline of [[chemistry]].\n\n==History of atomic theory==\n{{Main|Atomic theory}}\n\n===Atoms in philosophy===\n{{Main|Atomism}}\nThe idea that matter is made up of discrete units is a very old idea, appearing in many ancient cultures such as Greece and India. The word \"atom\" was coined by ancient Greek philosophers. However, these ideas were founded in philosophical and theological reasoning rather than evidence and experimentation. As a result, their views on what atoms look like and how they behave were incorrect. They also could not convince everybody, so atomism was but one of a number of competing theories on the nature of matter. It was not until the 19th century that the idea was embraced and refined by scientists, when the blossoming science of chemistry produced discoveries that only the concept of atoms could explain.\n\n===First evidence-based theory===\n[[File:Daltons symbols.gif|right|thumb|Various atoms and molecules as depicted in [[John Dalton]]'s ''A New System of Chemical Philosophy'' (1808).]]\nIn the early 1800s, [[John Dalton]] used the concept of atoms to explain why [[Chemical element|elements]] always react in ratios of small whole numbers (the [[law of multiple proportions]]). For instance, there are two types of [[tin oxide (disambiguation)|tin oxide]]: one is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen and the other is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen ([[tin(II) oxide]] and [[tin dioxide]] respectively). This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2, a ratio of small whole numbers. This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete units\u2014in other words, atoms. In the case of tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.<ref name=\"From AtomosToAtom\">{{cite book|author=Andrew G. van Melsen |year=1952 |title=From Atomos to Atom |isbn= 0-486-49584-1 |publisher=Dover Publications |location=Mineola, N.Y.}}</ref>\n\nDalton also believed atomic theory could explain why water absorbs different gases in different proportions. For example, he found that water absorbs [[carbon dioxide]] far better than it absorbs [[nitrogen]].<ref name = \"Dalton_1803_paper\">Dalton, John. \"[http://web.lemoyne.edu/~GIUNTA/dalton52.html On the Absorption of Gases by Water and Other Liquids]\", in ''Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester''. 1803. Retrieved on August 29, 2007.</ref> Dalton hypothesized this was due to the differences between the masses and configurations of the gases' respective particles, and carbon dioxide molecules (CO<sub>2</sub>) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N<sub>2</sub>).\n\n===Brownian motion===\nIn 1827, [[Botany|botanist]] [[Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)|Robert Brown]] used a microscope to look at dust grains floating in water and discovered that they moved about erratically, a phenomenon that became known as \"[[Brownian motion]]\". This was thought to be caused by water molecules knocking the grains about. In 1905 [[Albert Einstein]] proved the reality of these molecules and their motions by producing the first [[Statistical physics]] analysis of [[Brownian motion]].<ref name=adp322_8_549/><ref>{{cite book\n|last=Mazo|first=Robert M.|year=2002\n|title=Brownian Motion: Fluctuations, Dynamics, and Applications\n|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-851567-7\n|oclc=48753074|pages=1\u20137}}\n</ref><ref name=lee_hoon1995/> French physicist [[Jean Perrin]] used Einstein's work to experimentally determine the mass and dimensions of atoms, thereby conclusively verifying [[Dalton's atomic theory]].<ref name=e31_2_50/>\n\n===Discovery of the electron===\n[[File:Gold foil experiment conclusions.svg|thumb|right|The '''[[Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment]]'''<br /> ''Top:'' Expected results: alpha particles passing through the plum pudding model of the atom with negligible deflection.<br /> ''Bottom:'' Observed results: a small portion of the particles were deflected by the concentrated positive charge of the nucleus.]]\nThe physicist [[J. J. Thomson]] measured the mass of cathode rays, showing they were made of particles, but were around 1800 times lighter than the lightest atom, [[hydrogen]]. Therefore, they were not atoms, but a new particle, the first ''[[subatomic particle|subatomic]]'' particle to be discovered, which he originally called \"''corpuscle''\" but was later named ''electron'', after particles postulated by [[George Johnstone Stoney]] in 1874. He also showed they were identical to particles given off by [[Photoelectric effect|photoelectric]] and radioactive materials.<ref name=\"Thomson\">{{cite journal\n  | last = Thomson\n  | first = J.

Thomson was given the 1906 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this work. Thus he overturned the belief that atoms are the indivisible, ultimate particles of matter.<ref name=nobel1096/> Thomson also incorrectly postulated that the low mass, negatively charged electrons were distributed throughout the atom in a uniform sea of positive charge. This became known as the [[plum pudding model]].\n\n===Discovery of the nucleus===\n{{main|Geiger-Marsden experiment}}\nIn 1909, [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Ernest Marsden]], under the direction of [[Ernest Rutherford]], bombarded a metal foil with [[alpha particle]]s to observe how they scattered. They expected all the alpha particles to pass straight through with little deflection, because Thomson's model said that the charges in the atom are so diffuse that their electric fields could not affect the alpha particles much. However, Geiger and Marsden spotted alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90\u00b0, which was supposed to be impossible according to Thomson's model. To explain this, Rutherford proposed that the positive charge of the atom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus at the center of the atom.<ref name=pm21_669/>\n\n===Discovery of isotopes===\nWhile experimenting with the products of [[radioactive decay]], in 1913 [[radiochemistry|radiochemist]] [[Frederick Soddy]] discovered that there appeared to be more than one type of atom at each position on the periodic table.<ref name=npc1921/> The term [[isotope]] was coined by [[Margaret Todd (doctor)|Margaret Todd]] as a suitable name for different atoms that belong to the same element. J.J. Thomson created a technique for separating atom types through his work on ionized gases, which subsequently led to the discovery of [[stable isotope]]s.<ref name=prsA_89_1_1913/>\n\n===Bohr model===\n[[File:Bohr atom animation 2.gif|right|thumb|The Bohr model of the atom, with an electron making instantaneous \"quantum leaps\" from one orbit to another. This model is obsolete.]]\n{{main|Bohr model}}\n\nIn 1913 the physicist [[Niels Bohr]] proposed a model in which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only do so in a finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon.<ref name=stern20050516/> This quantization was used to explain why the electrons orbits are stable (given that normally, charges in acceleration, including circular motion, lose kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation, see ''[[synchrotron radiation]]'') and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra.<ref name=bohr19221211/>\n\nLater in the same year [[Henry Moseley]] provided additional experimental evidence in favor of [[Bohr model|Niels Bohr's theory]]. These results refined [[Ernest Rutherford]]'s and [[Antonius Van den Broek]]'s model, which proposed that the atom contains in its [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] a number of positive [[nuclear charge]]s that is equal to its (atomic) number in the periodic table. Until these experiments, [[atomic number]] was not known to be a physical and experimental quantity. That it is equal to the atomic nuclear charge remains the accepted atomic model today.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last=Pais|first=Abraham|year=1986|location=New York\n|title=Inward Bound: Of Matter and Forces in the Physical World |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-851971-0|pages=228\u2013230}}</ref>\n\n===Chemical bonding explained===\n[[Chemical bond]]s between atoms were now explained, by [[Gilbert Newton Lewis]] in 1916, as the interactions between their constituent electrons.<ref name=jacs38_4_762/> As the [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the [[periodic law]],<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Scerri|first=Eric R.\n|title=The periodic table: its story and its significance\n|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2007\n|isbn=0-19-530573-6|pages=205\u2013226}}</ref> in 1919 the American chemist [[Irving Langmuir]] suggested that this could be explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of [[electron shell]]s about the nucleus.<ref name=jacs41_6_868/>\n\n===Further developments in quantum physics===\nThe [[Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment]] of 1922 provided further evidence of the quantum nature of the atom. When a beam of silver atoms was passed through a specially shaped magnetic field, the beam was split based on the direction of an atom's angular momentum, or spin. As this direction is random, the beam could be expected to spread into a line. Instead, the beam was split into two parts, depending on whether the atomic spin was oriented up or down.<ref name=fop17_6_575/>\n\nIn 1924, [[Louis de Broglie]] proposed that all particles behave to an extent like waves. In 1926, [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] used this idea to develop a mathematical model of the atom that described the electrons as three-dimensional [[waveform]]s rather than point particles. A consequence of using waveforms to describe particles is that it is mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the [[Point (geometry)|position]] and [[momentum]] of a particle at a given point in time; this became known as the [[uncertainty principle]], formulated by [[Werner Heisenberg]] in 1926. In this concept, for a given accuracy in measuring a position one could only obtain a range of probable values for momentum, and vice versa.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQKELOE9eY4 What is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle? - Chad Orzel TED-ED talk]</ref>\nThis model was able to explain observations of atomic behavior that previous models could not, such as certain structural and [[Spectral line|spectral]] patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen. Thus, the planetary model of the atom was discarded in favor of one that described [[atomic orbital]] zones around the nucleus where a given electron is most likely to be observed.<ref name=brown2007/><ref name=harrison2000/>\n\n===Discovery of the neutron===\nThe development of the [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] allowed the mass of atoms to be measured with increased accuracy. The device uses a magnet to bend the trajectory of a beam of ions, and the amount of deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom's mass to its charge. The chemist [[Francis William Aston]] used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses. The [[atomic mass]] of these isotopes varied by integer amounts, called the [[whole number rule]].<ref name=pm39_6_449/> The explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the [[neutron]], an uncharged particle with a mass similar to the [[proton]], by the physicist [[James Chadwick]] in 1932. Isotopes were then explained as elements with the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons within the nucleus.<ref name=chadwick1935/>\n\n===Fission, high-energy physics and condensed matter===\nIn 1938, the German chemist [[Otto Hahn]], a student of Rutherford, directed neutrons onto uranium atoms expecting to get [[transuranium element]]s. Instead, his chemical experiments showed [[barium]] as a product.<ref name=Bowden/><ref name=CHF/> A year later, [[Lise Meitner]] and her nephew [[Otto Frisch]] verified that Hahn's result were the first experimental ''nuclear fission''.<ref name=nature143_3615_239/><ref name=schroeder/> In 1944, Hahn received the [[Nobel prize]] in chemistry. Despite Hahn's efforts, the contributions of Meitner and Frisch were not recognized.<ref name=pt50_9_26/>\n\nIn the 1950s, the development of improved [[particle accelerator]]s and [[particle detector]]s allowed scientists to study the impacts of atoms moving at high energies.<ref name=kullander2001/> Neutrons and protons were found to be [[hadron]]s, or composites of smaller particles called [[quark]]s. The [[standard model of particle physics]] was developed that so far has successfully explained the properties of the nucleus in terms of these sub-atomic particles and the forces that govern their interactions.<ref name=npp1990/>\n\n==Structure==\n\n===Subatomic particles===\n{{Main|Subatomic particle}}\nThough the word ''atom'' originally denoted a particle that cannot be cut into smaller particles, in modern scientific usage the atom is composed of various [[subatomic particle]]s. The constituent particles of an atom are the [[electron]], the [[proton]] and the [[neutron]]; all three are [[fermion]]s. However, the [[hydrogen|hydrogen-1]] atom has no neutrons and the [[hydron (chemistry)|hydron ion]] has no electrons.\n\nThe electron is by far the least massive of these particles at {{val|9.11|e=-31|u=kg}}, with a negative [[Electric charge|electrical charge]] and a size that is too small to be measured using available techniques.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Demtr\u00f6der|first=Wolfgang|year=2002\n|title=Atoms, Molecules and Photons: An Introduction to Atomic- Molecular- and Quantum Physics\n|publisher=Springer|edition=1st\n|isbn=3-540-20631-0\n|oclc=181435713|pages=39\u201342}}</ref> It is the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured. Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number, then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole; a charged atom is called an [[ion]]. Electrons have been known since the late 19th century, mostly thanks to [[J.J. Thomson]]; see [[history of subatomic physics]] for details.\n\nProtons have a positive charge and a mass 1,836 times that of the electron, at {{val|1.6726|e=-27|u=kg}}. The number of protons in an atom is called its [[atomic number]]. [[Ernest Rutherford]] (1919) observed that nitrogen under alpha-particle bombardment ejects what appeared to be hydrogen nuclei. By 1920 he had accepted that the hydrogen nucleus is a distinct particle within the atom and named it [[proton]].\n\nNeutrons have no electrical charge and have a free mass of 1,839 times the mass of the electron,<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Woan|first=Graham|year=2000\n|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Physics\n|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-57507-9\n|oclc=224032426|page=8}}</ref> or {{val|1.6929|e=-27|u=kg}}, the heaviest of the three constituent particles, but it can be reduced by the [[nuclear binding energy]]. Neutrons and protons (collectively known as [[nucleon]]s) have comparable dimensions\u2014on the order of {{val|2.5|e=-15|u=m}}\u2014although the 'surface' of these particles is not sharply defined.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=MacGregor|first=Malcolm H.|year=1992\n|title=The Enigmatic Electron\n|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-521833-7\n|oclc=223372888|pages=33\u201337}}</ref> The neutron was discovered in 1932 by the English physicist [[James Chadwick]].\n\nIn the [[Standard Model]] of physics, electrons are truly elementary particles with no internal structure. However, both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of [[elementary particle]]s called [[quark]]s. There are two types of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge. Protons are composed of two [[up quark]]s (each with charge +{{sfrac|2|3}}) and one [[down quark]] (with a charge of \u2212{{sfrac|1|3}}). Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks. This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles.<ref name=pdg2002/><ref name=schombert2006/>\n\nThe quarks are held together by the [[strong interaction]] (or strong force), which is mediated by [[gluon]]s. The protons and neutrons, in turn, are held to each other in the nucleus by the [[nuclear force]], which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range-properties (see the article on the nuclear force for more). The gluon is a member of the family of [[gauge boson]]s, which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces.<ref name=pdg2002/><ref name=schombert2006/>\n\n===Nucleus===\n{{Main|Atomic nucleus}}\n[[File:Binding energy curve - common isotopes.svg|thumb|350px|The [[binding energy]] needed for a nucleon to escape the nucleus, for various isotopes]]<!-- A brief explanation is provided here because 'binding energy' is not explained until the end of the setion. -->\n\nAll the bound protons and neutrons in an atom make up a tiny [[atomic nucleus]], and are collectively called [[nucleon]]s. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07&nbsp;{{radic|''A''|3}}&nbsp;[[femtometre|fm]], where ''A'' is the total number of nucleons.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Jevremovic|first=Tatjana|year=2005\n|title=Nuclear Principles in Engineering\n|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-387-23284-2\n|oclc=228384008|page=63}}</ref> This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 10<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the [[residual strong force]]. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the [[electrostatic force]] that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Pfeffer|first=Jeremy I.\n|last2=Nir|first2=Shlomo\n|year=2000\n|title=Modern Physics: An Introductory Text\n|publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn=1-86094-250-4\n|oclc=45900880|pages=330\u2013336}}</ref>\n\nAtoms of the same [[chemical element|element]] have the same number of protons, called the [[atomic number]]. Within a single element, the number of neutrons may vary, determining the [[isotope]] of that element. The total number of protons and neutrons determine the [[nuclide]]. The number of neutrons relative to the protons determines the stability of the nucleus, with certain isotopes undergoing [[radioactive decay]].<ref name=wenner2007/>\n\nThe proton, the electron, and the neutron are classified as [[fermion]]s. Fermions obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] which prohibits ''[[identical particles|identical]]'' fermions, such as multiple protons, from occupying the same quantum state at the same time. Thus, every proton in the nucleus must occupy a quantum state different from all other protons, and the same applies to all neutrons of the nucleus and to all electrons of the electron cloud. However, a proton and a neutron are allowed to occupy the same quantum state.<ref name=\"raymond\"/>\n\nFor atoms with low atomic numbers, a nucleus that has more neutrons than protons tends to drop to a lower energy state through radioactive decay so that the [[neutron\u2013proton ratio]] is closer to one. However, as the atomic number increases, a higher proportion of neutrons is required to offset the mutual repulsion of the protons. Thus, there are no stable nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers above atomic number ''Z'' = 20 (calcium) and as ''Z'' increases, the neutron\u2013proton ratio of stable isotopes increases.<ref name=\"raymond\"/> The stable isotope with the highest proton\u2013neutron ratio is [[lead-208]] (about 1.5).\n\n[[File:Wpdms physics proton proton chain 1.svg|right|thumb|Illustration of a nuclear fusion process that forms a deuterium nucleus, consisting of a proton and a neutron, from two protons. A [[positron]] (e<sup>+</sup>)\u2014an [[antimatter]] electron\u2014is emitted along with an electron [[neutrino]].]]\n\nThe number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus can be modified, although this can require very high energies because of the strong force. [[Nuclear fusion]] occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, at the core of the Sun protons require energies of 3\u201310 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion\u2014the [[coulomb barrier]]\u2014and fuse together into a single nucleus.<ref name=mihos2002/> [[Nuclear fission]] is the opposite process, causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei\u2014usually through radioactive decay. The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.<ref name=lbnl20070330/><ref name=makhijani_saleska2001/>\n\nIf the mass of the nucleus following a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a [[gamma ray]], or the kinetic energy of a [[beta particle]]), as described by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[mass\u2013energy equivalence]] formula, ''E''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''mc''<sup>2</sup>, where ''m'' is the mass loss and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. This deficit is part of the [[binding energy]] of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.<ref>{{cite book\n|last1=Shultis|first1=J.

For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per [[nucleon]] in the nucleus begins to decrease. That means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about 26, and [[atomic mass]]es higher than about 60, is an [[endothermic reaction|endothermic process]]. These more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] of a star.<ref name=\"raymond\"/>\n\n===Electron cloud===\n{{Main|Atomic orbital|Electron configuration}}\n\n[[File:Potential energy well.svg|right|thumb|A potential well, showing, according to [[classical mechanics]], the minimum energy ''V''(''x'') needed to reach each position ''x''. Classically, a particle with energy ''E'' is constrained to a range of positions between ''x''<sub>1</sub> and ''x''<sub>2</sub>.]]\nThe electrons in an atom are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the [[electromagnetic force]]. This force binds the electrons inside an [[electrostatic]] [[potential well]] surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound near the center of the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.\n\nElectrons, like other particles, have properties of both a [[Wave\u2013particle duality|particle and a wave]]. The electron cloud is a region inside the potential well where each electron forms a type of three-dimensional [[standing wave]]\u2014a wave form that does not move relative to the nucleus. This behavior is defined by an [[atomic orbital]], a mathematical function that characterises the probability that an electron appears to be at a particular location when its position is measured.<ref name=science157_3784_13/> Only a discrete (or [[wikt:quantize|quantized]]) set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus, as other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into a more stable form.<ref name=Brucat2008/> Orbitals can have one or more ring or node structures, and differ from each other in size, shape and orientation.<ref name=manthey2001/>\n\n[[File:S-p-Orbitals.svg|left|thumb|Wave functions of the first five atomic orbitals. The three 2p orbitals each display a single angular [[Node (physics)|node]] that has an orientation and a minimum at the center.]] [[File:Atomic orbitals and periodic table construction.ogv|left|thumb|How atoms are constructed from electron orbitals and link to the periodic table]]\n\nEach atomic orbital corresponds to a particular [[energy level]] of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a [[photon]] with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through [[spontaneous emission]], an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by the differences in the energies of the quantum states, are responsible for [[atomic spectral line]]s.<ref name=Brucat2008/>\n\nThe amount of energy needed to remove or add an electron\u2014the [[electron binding energy]]\u2014is far less than the [[binding energy|binding energy of nucleons]]. For example, it requires only 13.6&nbsp;eV to strip a [[Stationary state|ground-state]] electron from a hydrogen atom,<ref name=herter_8/> compared to 2.23&nbsp;''million'' eV for splitting a [[deuterium]] nucleus.<ref name=pr79_2_282/> Atoms are [[electric charge|electrically]] neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons. Atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called [[ion]]s. Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms. By this mechanism, atoms are able to [[chemical bond|bond]] into [[molecule]]s and other types of [[chemical compound]]s like [[Ionic crystal|ionic]] and [[Covalent bond|covalent]] network [[Crystallization|crystals]].<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Smirnov|first=Boris M.|year=2003\n|title=Physics of Atoms and Ions\n|publisher=Springer\n|isbn=0-387-95550-X|pages=249\u2013272}}</ref>\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Nuclear properties===\n{{Main|Isotope|Stable isotope|List of nuclides|List of elements by stability of isotopes}}\n\nBy definition, any two atoms with an identical number of ''protons'' in their nuclei belong to the same [[chemical element]]. Atoms with equal numbers of protons but a different number of ''neutrons'' are different isotopes of the same element. For example, all hydrogen atoms admit exactly one proton, but isotopes exist with no neutrons ([[hydrogen-1]], by far the most common form,<ref name=matis2000/> also called protium), one neutron ([[deuterium]]), two neutrons ([[tritium]]) and [[isotopes of hydrogen|more than two neutrons]]. The known elements form a set of atomic numbers, from the single proton element [[hydrogen]] up to the 118-proton element [[ununoctium]].<ref name=weiss20061017/> All known isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater than 82 are radioactive.<ref name=s131>{{cite book\n|last=Sills|first=Alan D.|year=2003\n|title=Earth Science the Easy Way\n|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|isbn=0-7641-2146-4\n|oclc=51543743|pages=131\u2013134}}</ref><ref name=dume20030423/>\n\nAbout 339 nuclides occur naturally on [[Earth]],<ref name=lidsay20000730/> of which 254 (about 75%) have not been observed to decay, and are referred to as \"[[stable isotope]]s\". However, only 90 of these nuclides are stable to all decay, even [[list of nuclides|in theory]]. Another 164 (bringing the total to 254) have not been observed to decay, even though in theory it is energetically possible. These are also formally classified as \"stable\". An additional 34 radioactive nuclides have half-lives longer than 80 million years, and are long-lived enough to be present from the birth of the [[solar system]]. This collection of 288 nuclides are known as [[primordial nuclide]]s. Finally, an additional 51 short-lived nuclides are known to occur naturally, as daughter products of primordial nuclide decay (such as [[radium]] from [[uranium]]), or else as products of natural energetic processes on Earth, such as cosmic ray bombardment (for example, carbon-14).<ref name=tuli2005/><ref group=note>For more recent updates see [http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart Interactive Chart of Nuclides (Brookhaven National Laboratory)].</ref><!-- See article [[list of nuclides]]. The numbers are derived by [[WP:CALC]] (counting the table), which is not [[WP:OR]]-->\n\nFor 80 of the chemical elements, at least one [[stable isotope]] exists. As a rule, there is only a handful of stable isotopes for each of these elements, the average being 3.2 stable isotopes per element. Twenty-six elements have only a single stable isotope, while the largest number of stable isotopes observed for any element is ten, for the element [[tin]]. Elements [[technetium|43]], [[promethium|61]], and all elements numbered [[bismuth|83]] or higher have no stable isotopes.<ref name=CRC>CRC Handbook (2002).</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nStability of isotopes is affected by the ratio of protons to neutrons, and also by the presence of certain \"magic numbers\" of neutrons or protons that represent closed and filled quantum shells. These quantum shells correspond to a set of energy levels within the [[Nuclear shell model|shell model]] of the nucleus; filled shells, such as the filled shell of 50 protons for tin, confers unusual stability on the nuclide. Of the 254 known stable nuclides, only four have both an odd number of protons ''and'' odd number of neutrons: [[hydrogen-2]] ([[deuterium]]), [[lithium-6]], [[boron-10]] and [[nitrogen-14]]. Also, only four naturally occurring, radioactive odd\u2013odd nuclides have a half-life over a billion years: [[potassium-40]], [[vanadium-50]], [[lanthanum-138]] and [[tantalum-180m]]. Most odd\u2013odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to [[beta decay]], because the decay products are even\u2013even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to [[Semi-empirical mass formula#Pairing term|nuclear pairing effects]].<ref name=CRC/>{{Page needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n===Mass===\n{{Main|Atomic mass|mass number}}\n\nThe large majority of an atom's mass comes from the protons and neutrons that make it up. The total number of these particles (called \"nucleons\") in a given atom is called the [[mass number]]. It is a positive integer and dimensionless (instead of having dimension of mass), because it expresses a count. An example of use of a mass number is \"carbon-12,\" which has 12 nucleons (six protons and six neutrons).\n\nThe actual [[Invariant mass|mass of an atom at rest]] is often expressed using the [[Atomic mass unit|unified atomic mass unit]] (u), also called dalton (Da). This unit is defined as a twelfth of the mass of a free neutral atom of [[carbon-12]], which is approximately {{val|1.66|e=-27|u=kg}}.<ref name=iupac/> [[hydrogen atom|Hydrogen-1]] (the lightest isotope of hydrogen which is also the nuclide with the lowest mass) has an atomic weight of 1.007825&nbsp;u.<ref name=chieh2001/> The value of this number is called the [[atomic mass]]. A given atom has an atomic mass approximately equal (within 1%) to its mass number times the atomic mass unit (for example the mass of a nitrogen-14 is roughly 14&nbsp;u). However, this number will not be exactly an integer except in the case of carbon-12 (see below).<ref name=nist_wc/> The heaviest [[stable atom]] is lead-208,<ref name=s131/> with a mass of {{val|207.9766521|u=u}}.<ref name=audi2003/>\n\nAs even the most massive atoms are far too light to work with directly, chemists instead use the unit of [[Mole (unit)|moles]]. One mole of atoms of any element always has the same number of atoms (about [[Avogadro constant|{{val|6.022|e=23}}]]). This number was chosen so that if an element has an atomic mass of 1&nbsp;u, a mole of atoms of that element has a mass close to one gram. Because of the definition of the [[Atomic mass unit|unified atomic mass unit]], each carbon-12 atom has an atomic mass of exactly 12&nbsp;u, and so a mole of carbon-12 atoms weighs exactly 0.012&nbsp;kg.<ref name=iupac>{{cite book\n|last=Mills|first=Ian\n|author2=Cvita\u0161, Tomislav|author3= Homann, Klaus|author4= Kallay, Nikola|author5= Kuchitsu, Kozo\n|title=Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry\n|publisher=[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]], Commission on Physiochemical Symbols Terminology and Units, Blackwell Scientific Publications\n|location=Oxford|edition=2nd|year=1993\n|isbn=0-632-03583-8\n|oclc=27011505\n|url=http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/gbook/green_book_2ed.pdf\n|page=70}}</ref>\n\n===Shape and size===\n{{Main|Atomic radius}}\nAtoms lack a well-defined outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually described in terms of an [[atomic radius]].

Radioactivity can occur when the radius of a nucleus is large compared with the radius of the strong force, which only acts over distances on the order of 1&nbsp;fm.<ref name=splung/>\n\nThe most common forms of radioactive decay are:<ref>{{cite book\n|last=L'Annunziata<!-- Note: the single quote mark before the name is correct. -->\n|first=Michael F.\n|year=2003|title=Handbook of Radioactivity Analysis\n|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=0-12-436603-1\n|oclc=16212955|pages=3\u201356}}</ref><ref name=firestone20000522/>\n* [[Alpha decay]]: this process is caused when the nucleus emits an alpha particle, which is a helium nucleus consisting of two protons and two neutrons. The result of the emission is a new element with a lower [[atomic number]].\n* [[Beta decay]] (and [[electron capture]]): these processes are regulated by the [[weak force]], and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an [[antineutrino]], while proton to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes the emission of a [[positron]] and a [[neutrino]]. The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. Electron capture is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a neutron.\n* [[Gamma decay]]: this process results from a change in the energy level of the nucleus to a lower state, resulting in the emission of electromagnetic radiation. The excited state of a nucleus which results in gamma emission usually occurs following the emission of an alpha or a beta particle. Thus, gamma decay usually follows alpha or beta decay.\n\nOther more rare types of [[radioactive decay]] include ejection of neutrons or protons or clusters of [[nucleon]]s from a nucleus, or more than one [[beta particle]]. An analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose energy in a different way, is [[internal conversion]]\u2014 a process that produces high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, followed by production of high-energy photons that are not gamma rays. A few large nuclei explode into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons, in a decay called spontaneous [[nuclear fission]].\n\nEach [[radioactive isotope]] has a characteristic decay time period\u2014the [[half-life]]\u2014that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an [[exponential decay]] process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth.<ref name=splung/>\n\n===Magnetic moment===\n{{Main|Electron magnetic moment|Nuclear magnetic moment}}\n\nElementary particles possess an intrinsic quantum mechanical property known as [[Spin (physics)|spin]]. This is analogous to the [[angular momentum]] of an object that is spinning around its [[center of mass]], although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point-like and cannot be said to be rotating. Spin is measured in units of the reduced [[Planck constant]] (\u0127), with electrons, protons and neutrons all having spin \u00bd&nbsp;\u0127, or \"spin-\u00bd\". In an atom, electrons in motion around the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] possess orbital [[angular momentum]] in addition to their spin, while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin.<ref name=hornak2006/>\n\nThe [[magnetic field]] produced by an atom\u2014its [[magnetic moment]]\u2014is determined by these various forms of angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a magnetic field. However, the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due to the nature of electrons to obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], in which no two electrons may be found in the same [[quantum state]], bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.<ref name=schroeder2/>\n\nIn [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] elements such as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an [[exchange interaction]]. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. [[Paramagnetism|Paramagnetic materials]] have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up in the presence of a field.<ref name=schroeder2/><ref name=goebel20070901/>\n\nThe nucleus of an atom will have no spin when it has even numbers of both neutrons and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may have a spin. Normally nuclei with spin are aligned in random directions because of [[thermal equilibrium]]. However, for certain elements (such as [[xenon|xenon-129]]) it is possible to [[spin polarization|polarize]] a significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction\u2014a condition called [[hyperpolarization (physics)|hyperpolarization]].

Do not forget that even the top of the diagram is lower than an unbound electron state.]]\nThe [[potential energy]] of an electron in an atom is [[negative number|negative]], its dependence of its [[position (vector)|position]] reaches the [[minimum]] (the most [[absolute value]]) inside the nucleus, and vanishes when the [[distance]] from the nucleus [[limit at infinity|goes to infinity]], roughly in an [[inverse proportion]] to the distance. In the quantum-mechanical model, a bound electron can only occupy a set of [[quantum state|states]] centered on the nucleus, and each state corresponds to a specific [[energy level]]; see [[time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] for theoretical explanation. An energy level can be measured by the [[ionization potential|amount of energy needed to unbind]] the electron from the atom, and is usually given in units of [[electronvolt]]s (eV). The lowest energy state of a bound electron is called the ground state, i.e. [[stationary state]], while an electron transition to a higher level results in an excited state.<ref name=zeghbroeck1998/> The electron's energy raises when ''[[principal quantum number|n]]'' increases because the (average) distance to the nucleus increases. Dependence of the energy on [[azimuthal quantum number|{{ell}}]] is caused not by [[electrostatic potential]] of the nucleus, but by interaction between electrons.\n\nFor an electron to [[atomic electron transition|transition between two different states]], e.g. grounded state to first excited level ([[ionization]]), it must absorb or emit a [[photon]] at an energy matching the difference in the potential energy of those levels, according to [[Niels Bohr]] model, what can be precisely calculated by the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]].\nElectrons jump between orbitals in a particle-like fashion. For example, if a single photon strikes the electrons, only a single electron changes states in response to the photon; see [[Atomic orbital|Electron properties]].\n\nThe energy of an emitted photon is proportional to its [[frequency]], so these specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Fowles|first=Grant R.|year=1989\n|title=Introduction to Modern Optics\n|publisher=Courier Dover Publications\n|isbn=0-486-65957-7\n|oclc=18834711|pages=227\u2013233}}\n</ref> Each element has a characteristic spectrum that can depend on the nuclear charge, subshells filled by electrons, the electromagnetic interactions between the electrons and other factors.<ref name=martin2007/>\n\n[[File:Fraunhofer lines.svg|right|thumb|300px|An example of absorption lines in a spectrum]]\n\nWhen a continuous [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum of energy]] is passed through a gas or [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level. Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels. Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark [[absorption band]]s in the energy output. (An observer viewing the atoms from a view that does not include the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of [[emission line]]s from the photons emitted by the atoms.) [[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] measurements of the strength and width of [[atomic spectral line]]s allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.<ref name=avogadro/>\n\nClose examination of the spectral lines reveals that some display a [[fine structure]] splitting. This occurs because of [[spin\u2013orbit coupling]], which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron.<ref name=fitzpatrick20070216/> When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the [[Zeeman effect]]. This is caused by the interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple [[electron configuration]]s with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines.<ref name=weiss2001/> The presence of an external [[electric field]] can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the [[Stark effect]].<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Beyer|first=H.

For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching the energy of the interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make [[laser]]s, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.<ref name=watkins_sjsu/>\n\n===Valence and bonding behavior===\n{{Main|Valence (chemistry)|Chemical bond}}\n\nValency is the combining power of an element. It is equal to number of hydrogen atoms that atom can combine or displace in forming compounds.<ref>oxford dictionary \u2013 valency</ref> The outermost electron shell of an atom in its uncombined state is known as the [[valence shell]], and the electrons in\nthat shell are called [[valence electron]]s. The number of valence electrons determines the [[chemical bond|bonding]]\nbehavior with other atoms. Atoms tend to [[Chemical reaction|chemically react]] with each other in a manner that fills (or empties) their outer valence shells.<ref name=reusch20070716/> For example, a transfer of a single electron between atoms is a useful approximation for bonds that form between atoms with one-electron more than a filled shell, and others that are one-electron short of a full shell, such as occurs in the compound [[sodium chloride]] and other chemical ionic salts. However, many elements display multiple valences, or tendencies to share differing numbers of electrons in different compounds. Thus, [[chemical bond]]ing between these elements takes many forms of electron-sharing that are more than simple electron transfers. Examples include the element carbon and the [[organic compounds]].<ref name=chemguide/>\n\nThe [[chemical element]]s are often displayed in a [[periodic table]] that is laid out to display recurring chemical properties, and elements with the same number of valence electrons form a group that is aligned in the same column of the table. (The horizontal rows correspond to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons.) The elements at the far right of the table have their outer shell completely filled with electrons, which results in chemically inert elements known as the [[noble gas]]es.<ref name=husted20031211/><ref name=baum2003/>\n\n===States===\n{{Main|State of matter|Phase (matter)}}\n\n[[File:Bose Einstein condensate.png|left|thumb|Snapshots illustrating the formation of a [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]]]]\nQuantities of atoms are found in different states of matter that depend on the physical conditions, such as [[temperature]] and [[pressure]].

It uses the [[quantum tunneling]] phenomenon, which allows particles to pass through a barrier that would normally be insurmountable. Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes, on each of which is an [[adsorb]]ed atom, providing a tunneling-current density that can be measured. Scanning one atom (taken as the tip) as it moves past the other (the sample) permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral separation for a constant current. The calculation shows the extent to which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are visible. It confirms that for low bias, the microscope images the space-averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels\u2014the [[Fermi level]] [[local density of states]].<ref name=jacox1997/><ref name=nf_physics1986/>\n\nAn atom can be [[ion]]ized by removing one of its electrons. The [[electric charge]] causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a [[magnetic field]]. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field is determined by the mass of the atom. The [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometer]] uses this principle to measure the [[mass-to-charge ratio]] of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include [[inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy]] and [[inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry]], both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.<ref name=sab53_13_1739/>\n\nA more area-selective method is [[electron energy loss spectroscopy]], which measures the energy loss of an [[electron beam]] within a [[transmission electron microscope]] when it interacts with a portion of a sample.

Atomic nuclei forms in [[nucleosynthesis]] reactions. In about three minutes [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] produced most of the [[helium]], [[lithium]], and [[deuterium]] in the Universe, and perhaps some of the [[beryllium]] and [[boron]].<ref name=ns1794_42/><ref name=science267_5195_192/><ref name=hinshaw20051215/>\n\nUbiquitousness and stability of atoms relies on their [[binding energy]], which means that an atom has a lower energy than an unbound system of the nucleus and electrons. Where the [[temperature]] is much higher than [[ionization potential]], the matter exists in the form of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]\u2014a gas of positively charged ions (possibly, bare nuclei) and electrons. When the temperature drops below the ionization potential, atoms become [[statistical physics|statistically]] favorable. Atoms (complete with bound electrons) became to dominate over [[electric charge|charged]] [[particle]]s 380,000&nbsp;years after the Big Bang\u2014an epoch called [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]], when the expanding Universe cooled enough to allow electrons to become attached to nuclei.<ref name=abbott20070530/>\n\nSince the Big Bang, which produced no [[carbon]] or [[atomic number|heavier elements]], atomic nuclei have been combined in [[star]]s through the process of [[nuclear fusion]] to produce more of the element [[helium]], and (via the [[triple alpha process]]) the sequence of elements from carbon up to [[iron]];<ref name=mnras106_343/> see [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] for details.\n\nIsotopes such as lithium-6, as well as some beryllium and boron are generated in space through [[cosmic ray spallation]].<ref name=nature405_656/> This occurs when a high-energy proton strikes an atomic nucleus, causing large numbers of nucleons to be ejected.\n\nElements heavier than iron were produced in [[supernova]]e through the [[r-process]] and in [[Asymptotic giant branch|AGB stars]] through the [[s-process]], both of which involve the capture of neutrons by atomic nuclei.<ref name=mashnik2000/> Elements such as [[lead]] formed largely through the radioactive decay of heavier elements.<ref name=kgs20050504/>\n\n===Earth===\nMost of the atoms that make up the [[Earth]] and its inhabitants were present in their current form in the [[nebula]] that collapsed out of a [[molecular cloud]] to form the [[Solar System]].

Thus, the [[positron]] is a positively charged [[antielectron]] and the [[antiproton]] is a negatively charged equivalent of a [[proton]]. When a matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet, they annihilate each other. Because of this, along with an imbalance between the number of matter and antimatter particles, the latter are rare in the universe. The first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood, although theories of [[baryogenesis]] may offer an explanation. As a result, no antimatter atoms have been discovered in nature.<ref name=koppes1999/><ref name=cromie20010816/> However, in 1996 the antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom ([[antihydrogen]]) was synthesized at the [[CERN]] laboratory in [[Geneva]].<ref name=nature419_6906_439/><ref name=BBC20021030/>\n\nOther [[exotic atom]]s have been created by replacing one of the protons, neutrons or electrons with other particles that have the same charge. For example, an electron can be replaced by a more massive [[muon]], forming a [[muonic atom]]. These types of atoms can be used to test the fundamental predictions of physics.<ref name=ns1728_77/><ref name=psT112_1_20/><ref name=ripin1998/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Physics|Chemistry}}\n{{cmn|2|\n* [[History of quantum mechanics]]\n* [[Infinite divisibility]]\n* [[List of basic chemistry topics]]\n* [[Timeline of atomic and subatomic physics]]\n* [[Vector model of the atom]]\n* [[Nuclear model]]\n* [[Radioactive isotope]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n<!-- this 'empty' section displays references defined elsewhere -->\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n<ref name=leigh1990>{{cite book|editor=Leigh, G.
