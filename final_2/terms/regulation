In [[systems theory]], these types of rules exist in various fields of [[biology]] and [[society]], but the term has slightly different meanings according to context. For example:\n* in biology, [[gene regulation]] allows living organisms to adapt to their environment and maintain [[homeostasis]]\n* in [[government]], typically a regulation specifically means a piece of the [[delegated legislation]] drafted by subject matter experts to enforce a [[statutory instrument]] ([[primary legislation]])\n* in business,  [[industry self-regulation]] occurs through [[self-regulatory organization]]s and [[trade association]]s which allow industries to set rules with less government involvement\n* in psychology, [[self-regulation theory]] is the study of how individuals regulate their thoughts and behaviors to reach goals\n\n== Social ==\n\nRegulation can take many forms: [[law|legal]] restrictions promulgated by a [[government]] authority, contractual obligations (for example, contracts between insurers and their insureds<ref>Marcos Antonio Mendoza, \"Reinsurance as Governance: Governmental Risk Management Pools as a Case Study in the Governance Role Played by Reinsurance Institutions\", 21 Conn.

The regulations may prescribe or proscribe conduct (\"command-and-control\" regulation), calibrate incentives (\"incentive\" regulation), or change preferences (\"preferences shaping\" regulation\"). Common examples of regulation include controls on market entries, [[price]]s, [[wage]]s, [[development approvals]], [[pollution]] effects, [[employment]] for certain people in certain [[Industry|industries]], standards of production for certain [[good (economics)|good]]s, the military forces and [[Tertiary sector of industry|services]]. The [[economics]] of imposing or removing regulations relating to [[market (economics)|market]]s is analysed in [[regulatory economics]].\n\n===Reasons===\n\n{{weasel|date=October 2013}}\nRegulations may create costs as well as benefits and may produce unintended reactivity effects, such as defensive practice.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry|author2=Fischer, Michael Daniel |title=Reactivity and reactions to regulatory transparency in medicine, psychotherapy and counselling|journal=Social Science & Medicine|date=1 February 2012|volume=74|issue=3|pages=289\u2013296|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.035|pmid=22104085}}</ref> Efficient regulations can be defined as those where total benefits exceed total costs.\n\nRegulations can be advocated for a variety of reasons, including:{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n*[[Market failure]]s - regulation due to inefficiency.

Standardized weights and measures existed to an extent in the ancient world, and gold may have operated to some degree as an international currency. In China, a national currency system existed and paper currency was invented. Sophisticated law existed in [[Ancient Rome]]. In the European [[Early Middle Ages]], law and standardization declined with the Roman Empire, but regulation existed in the form of norms, customs, and privileges; this regulation was aided by the unified Christian identity and a sense of honor in regard to [[contract]]s.<ref>John Braithwaite, P\u00e9ter Drahos. (2000). ''Global Business Regulation''. Cambridge University Press.</ref>{{rp|5}}\n\nBeginning in the late 19th and 20th century, much of regulation in the United States was administered and enforced by [[regulatory agency|regulatory agencies]] which produced their own [[administrative law]] and procedures under the authority of statutes. Legislators created these agencies to allow experts in the industry to focus their attention on the issue. At the federal level, one of the earliest institutions was the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] which had its roots in earlier state-based regulatory commissions and agencies. Later agencies include the [[Federal Trade Commission]], [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], [[Civil Aeronautics Board]], and various other institutions. These institutions vary from industry to industry and at the federal and state level. Individual agencies do not necessarily have clear [[Enterprise life cycle|life-cycles]] or patterns of behavior, and they are influenced heavily by their leadership and staff as well as the [[organic law]] creating the agency. In the 1930s, lawmakers believed that unregulated business often led to injustice and inefficiency; in the 1960s and 1970s, concern shifted to [[regulatory capture]], which led to extremely detailed laws creating the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Consumer protection]]\n*[[Rulemaking]]\n*[[Regulatory state]]\n*[[Deregulation]]\n*[[Environmental law]]\n*[[Public administration]]\n*[[Regulation of science]]\n*[[Regulatory capture]]\n*[[Regulatory economics]]\n*[[Tragedy of the commons]]\n*[[Public choice theory]]\n*[[Precautionary principle]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [http://www.cerre.eu Centre on Regulation in Europe (CERRE)]\n* [http://www.tobinproject.org/books-papers/new-perspectives-regulation New Perspectives on Regulation (2009)] and [http://tobinproject.org/books-papers/government-markets Government and Markets: Toward a New Theory of Regulation (2009)]\n* [http://policyresearch.gc.ca/page.asp?pagenm=pub_wp020 US/Canadian Regulatory Cooperation:] [[Joelle Schmitz|Schmitz]] on Lessons from the European Union, [[Privy Council Office (Canada)|Canadian Privy Council Office]] Commissioned Study\n* [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1103644 A Comparative Bibliography: Regulatory Competition on Corporate Law]\n\n=== Wikibooks ===\n* [[b:Legal and Regulatory Issues in the Information Economy|Legal and Regulatory Issues in the Information Economy]]\n* [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=970646 Lawrence A.
