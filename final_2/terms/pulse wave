It is a term common to [[Analog synthesizer|synthesizer]] programming, and is a typical waveform available on many synthesizers. The exact shape of the wave is determined by the [[duty cycle]] of the [[oscillator]]. In many synthesizers, the duty cycle can be modulated (sometimes called pulse-width modulation) for a more dynamic timbre.<ref>http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb00/articles/synthsecrets.htm</ref>\nThe pulse wave is also known as the '''rectangular wave''', the [[Periodic function|periodic]] version of the [[rectangular function]].\n\nThe [[Fourier series]] expansion for a rectangular pulse wave with period {{math|''T''}} and pulse time {{math|''\u03c4''}} is\n\n:<math>f(t) = \\frac{\\tau}{T} + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2}{n\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi n\\tau}{T}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi n}{T} t\\right)</math>\n\nNote that, for symmetry, the starting time ({{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}) in this expansion is halfway through the first pulse. The phase can be offset to match the accompanying graph by replacing {{math|''t''}} with {{math|''t'' - ''\u03c4''/2}}.\n\nA pulse wave can be created by subtracting a [[sawtooth wave]] from a phase-shifted version of itself. If the sawtooth waves are [[bandlimited]], the resulting pulse wave is bandlimited, too. Another way to create one is with a single ramp wave (sawtooth or [[Triangle wave|triangle]]) and a comparator, with the ramp wave on one input, and a variable DC{{clarify|date=May 2015}} threshold on the other. The result will be a precisely controlled pulse width, but it will not be bandlimited.\n\nAcoustically, the rectangular wave has been described as having a more \"narrow and nasal\" sound than a perfect square wave, and its characteristic sound features prominently in many [[Steve Winwood]] songs.<ref name=\"winwood\">{{cite web|url=http://www.keyboardmag.com/lessons/1251/synth-soloing-in-the-style-of-steve-winwood/50240|title=Synth Soloing in the Style of Steve Winwood}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Sampling function]]\n*[[Pulse-width modulation]]\n*[[Sine wave]]\n*[[Triangle wave]]\n*[[Square wave]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pulse Wave}}\n[[Category:Waves]]\n\n\n{{Electronics-stub}}"}]}}}}
