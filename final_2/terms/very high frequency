[[Air traffic control]] communications and air navigation systems (e.g. [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] & [[Instrument landing system|ILS]]) work at distances of 100 kilometres or more to aircraft at cruising altitude.\n\nVHF was used for [[analog television]] stations in the US, and continues to be used for [[digital television]].\n\n==Propagation characteristics==\nVHF [[Radio propagation|propagation]] characteristics are suited for short-distance terrestrial communication, with a range generally somewhat farther than [[line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] from the transmitter (see formula below).\n* VHF waves are restricted to the local [[radio horizon]] less than 100 miles.\n* VHF is less affected by atmospheric noise and interference from electrical equipment than lower frequencies.\n* While it is blocked by land features such as hills and mountains, it is less affected by buildings and can be received indoors, although multipath television reception due to reflection from buildings can be a problem in urban areas.\n* Unlike high frequencies (HF), the [[ionosphere]] does not usually reflect VHF waves (called [[skywave]] propagation).\n* VHF waves can be aided by [[tropospheric ducting]]\n\n==Line-of-sight calculation==\n[[File:Rabbit-ears dipole antenna with UHF loop 20090204.jpg|thumb|\"Rabbit-ears\" VHF [[television antenna]] (the small loop is a separate UHF antenna).]]\n\nFor analog TV, VHF transmission range is a function of transmitter power, receiver sensitivity, and distance to the horizon, since VHF signals propagate under normal conditions as a near [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] phenomenon. The distance to the [[radio horizon]] is slightly extended over the geometric line of sight to the horizon, as radio waves are weakly bent back toward the Earth by the atmosphere. \n\nAn approximation to calculate the line-of-sight horizon distance (on Earth) is:\n*distance in nautical miles = <math>1.23\\times\\sqrt{  A_f}</math> where <math>A_f</math> is the height of the antenna in feet {{fact|date=June 2012}}\n*distance in kilometres = <math>\\sqrt{12.746 \\times A_m}</math> where <math>A_m</math> is the height of the antenna in metres. {{fact|date=June 2012}}\n\nThese approximations are only valid for antennas at heights that are small compared to the radius of the Earth. They may not necessarily be accurate in mountainous areas, since the landscape may not be transparent enough for radio waves.\n\nIn engineered communications systems, more complex calculations are required to assess the probable coverage area of a proposed transmitter station.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nThe accuracy of these calculations for [[digital television|digital TV]] signals is being debated.<ref name=grotticelli>{{cite news|url=http://broadcastengineering.com/news/dtv-transition-not-smooth-markets-0622/ |title=DTV Transition Not So Smooth in Some Markets |last=Grotticelli |first=Michael |date=2009-06-22 |work=Broadcast Engineering |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628083654/http://broadcastengineering.com/news/dtv-transition-not-smooth-markets-0622/ |archivedate=June 28, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Antennas==\n[[File:Superturnstile Tx Muehlacker.JPG|thumb|A VHF television broadcasting antenna. This is a common type called a super turnstile or [[batwing antenna]]. ]] \n\nVHF is the first band at which wavelengths are small enough to make efficient transmitting antennas for vehicles and handheld devices, so the VHF and UHF wavelengths are used for [[two way radio]]s in vehicles, aircraft, and handheld [[transceiver]]s and [[walkie talkie]]s. Portable radios usually use [[whip antenna|whips]] or [[rubber ducky antenna]]s, while base stations usually use larger fiberglass whips or [[collinear antenna array|collinear arrays]] of vertical dipoles.\n\nFor directional antennas, the [[Yagi-Uda antenna|Yagi antenna]] is the most widely used as a [[high gain antenna|high gain]] or \"beam\" antenna. For television reception, the Yagi is used, as well as the [[log periodic antenna]] due to its wider bandwidth. [[Helical antenna|Helical]] and [[turnstile antenna]]s are used for [[satellite communication]] since they employ [[circular polarization]]. For even higher gain, multiple Yagis or helicals can be mounted together as [[reflective array antenna|array antennas]]. Vertical [[collinear antenna array|collinear arrays]] of dipoles can be used to make high gain [[omnidirectional antenna]]s, in which more of the antenna's power is radiated in horizontal directions. Television and FM broadcasting stations use collinear arrays of specialized dipole antennas such as [[batwing antenna]]s.\n\n==Universal use==\nCertain subparts of the VHF band have the same use around the world. Some national uses are detailed below.\n*108&ndash;118&nbsp;MHz: Air navigation beacons [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] and [[Instrument Landing System]] localiser.\n*118&ndash;137&nbsp;MHz: [[Airband]] for [[air traffic control]], [[Amplitude modulation|AM]], 121.5&nbsp;MHz is emergency frequency\n*144&ndash;146&nbsp;MHz: [[Amateur radio]].

Other capital cities and regional areas used a combination of these and other frequencies as available. The initial commercial services in Hobart and Darwin were respectively allocated channels 6 and 8 rather than 7 or 9.  \n\nBy the early 1960s it became apparent that the 10 VHF channels were insufficient to support the growth of television services. This was rectified by the addition of three additional frequencies\u2014channels 0, 5A and 11. Older television sets using rotary dial tuners required adjustment to receive these new channels.  Most TVs of that era were not equipped to receive these broadcasts, and so were modified at the owners' expense to be able to tune into these bands; otherwise the owner had to buy a new TV.\n\nSeveral TV stations were allocated to VHF channels 3, 4 and 5, which were within the FM radio bands although not yet used for that purpose. A couple of notable examples were [[NBN Television|NBN-3]] [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[WIN (TV station)|WIN-4]] [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]] and [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] on channel 5. While some Channel 5 stations were moved to 5A in the 1970s and 80s, beginning in the 1990s, the Australian Broadcasting Authority began a process to move these stations to [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] bands to free up valuable VHF spectrum for its original purpose of FM radio. In addition, by 1985 the federal government decided new TV stations are to be broadcast on the UHF band.\n\nTwo new VHF, 9A and 12, have since been made available and are being used primarily for digital services (e.g. [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] in capital cities) but also for some new analogue services in regional areas. Because channel 9A is not used for television services in or near Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide or Perth, [[Digital radio in Australia|digital radio]] in those cities are broadcast on DAB frequencies blocks 9A, 9B and 9C.\n\nRefer to [[Australasian television frequencies]] for more information.\n\n===New Zealand===\n*44&ndash;51, 54&ndash;68&nbsp;MHz: [[Band I]] Television (channels 1&ndash;3)\n*87.5&ndash;108&nbsp;MHz: [[Band II]] Radio\n*174&ndash;230&nbsp;MHz: [[Band III]] Television (channels 4&ndash;11)\n\nIn [[New Zealand]], the four main Free-to-Air TV stations still use the VHF Television bands ([[Band I]] and [[Band III]]) to transmit to New Zealand households. Other stations, including a variety of pay and regional free-to-air stations, are forced to broadcast in the [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] band, since the VHF band is very overloaded with four stations sharing a very small frequency band, which can be so overcrowded that one or more channels, more often than not one of the MediaWorks-owned channels ([[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] and [[FOUR (New Zealand TV channel)|FOUR]]), is unavailable in some smaller towns.\n\nHowever, at the end of 2013, all television channels stopped broadcasting on the VHF bands.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|title=Going Digital - When is my area going digital?|url=http://www.goingdigital.co.nz/making-the-switch/coverage-areas-2/coverage-areas.html|work=goingdigital.co.nz|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nRefer to [[Australasian television frequencies]] for more information.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\n\nBritish television originally used VHF [[band I]] and [[band III]]. Television on VHF was in black and white with [[405-line]] format (although there were experiments with all three colour systems\u2014[[NTSC]], [[PAL]], and [[SECAM]]\u2014adapted for the 405-line system in the late 1950s and early 60s).\n\nBritish colour television was broadcast on [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] (channels 21\u201369), beginning in the late 1960s. From then on, TV was broadcast on both VHF and UHF (VHF being a monochromatic downconversion from the 625-line colour signal), with the exception of [[BBC Two|BBC2]] (which had always broadcast solely on UHF). The last British VHF TV transmitters closed down on January 3, 1985. VHF [[band III]] is now used in the UK for [[digital audio broadcasting]], and VHF [[band II]] is used for [[FM radio]], as it is in most of the world.\n\nUnusually, the UK has an [[amateur radio]] allocation at [[4 metres]], 70\u201370.5&nbsp;MHz.\n\n===United States and Canada===\nFrequency assignments between US and Canadian users are closely coordinated since much of the Canadian population is within VHF radio range of the US border. Certain discrete frequencies are reserved for [[radio astronomy]].  \nThe general services in the VHF band are:\n\n*30&ndash;46&nbsp;MHz: Licensed 2-way land mobile communication.<ref>The 42 MHz Segment is still currently used by the [[California Highway Patrol]], [[New Jersey State Police]], Tennessee Highway Patrol and other state law enforcement agencies.</ref>\n*30&ndash;88&nbsp;MHz: Military VHF-[[frequency modulation|FM]], including [[SINCGARS]]\n*43&ndash;50&nbsp;MHz: [[Cordless telephone]]s, 49&nbsp;MHz FM walkie-talkies and radio controlled toys, and mixed 2-way mobile communication.

That changed 3 more times: in 1940 when Channel 19 was deleted and several channels changed frequencies, then in 1946 with television going from 18 to 13 channels with different frequencies again, and finally in 1948 with the removal of Channel 1 (channels 2\u201313 remain as they are today). <ref>[http://www.tech-notes.tv/History&Trivia/Channel%20One/Channel_1.htm Tech Notes: What Ever Happened to Channel 1?-Table 1. Retrieved March 27, 2014.]</ref>\n \nThe move from VHF for [[analog television]] to [[UHF]] for [[digital television]] has made the large technically and commercially valuable slice of the VHF spectrum formerly taken up by television broadcasting available for relicensing or sale after a transition period, which ended June 12, 2009 in the [[United States]]; ''see ''[[Digital television#Effect on existing analog technology|Effect on existing analog technology]] for dates in other countries.\n\n====87.5\u201387.9 MHz====\n87.5\u201387.9 MHz is a radio frequency which, in most of the world, is used for [[FM broadcasting]]. In [[North America]], however, this bandwidth is allocated to VHF television channel 6 (82\u201388&nbsp;MHz). The analog audio for TV channel 6 is broadcast at 87.75&nbsp;MHz (adjustable down to 87.74). Several stations, most notably those joining the [[Pulse 87]] franchise, have operated on this frequency as radio stations, though they use television licenses.  As a result, FM radio receivers such as those found in automobiles which are designed to tune into this frequency range could receive the audio for analog-mode programming on the local TV channel 6 while in North America.\n\n87.9&nbsp;MHz is normally off-limits for FM audio broadcasting except for displaced class D stations which have no other frequencies in the normal 88.1\u2013107.9&nbsp;MHz subband on which to move.  So far, only 2 stations have qualified to operate on 87.9&nbsp;MHz: 10-watt [[KSFH]] in [[Mountain View, California]] and 34-watt translator [[K200AA]] in [[Sun Valley, Nevada]].\n\n==Unlicensed operation==\nIn some countries, particularly the United States and Canada, limited low-power license-free operation is available in the FM broadcast band for purposes such as micro-broadcasting and sending output from [[Compact Disk|CD]] or digital media players to radios without auxiliary-in jacks, though this is illegal in some other countries.  This practice was legalised in the United Kingdom on 8 December 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ofcom.org.uk/2006/11/23/change-to-the-law-to-allow-the-use-of-low-power-fm-transmitters-for-mp3-players/ |title=Ofcom &#124; Change to the law to allow the use of low power FM transmitters for MP3 players |publisher=Media.ofcom.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-02}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Marine VHF radio]]\n*[[List of oldest radio stations]]\n*[[Apex (radio band)]]\n*[[FM broadcast band]]\n*[[Moving image formats]]\n*[[Polar mesosphere summer echoes]]\n*[[Television channel frequencies]]\n*[[Knife-edge effect]]\n*[[Instrument Landing System]]\n*[[VHF omnidirectional range]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{TVRband}}\n{{Radio_spectrum}}\n{{EMSpectrum}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n{{Analogue TV transmitter topics}}\n{{Audio broadcasting}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Very High Frequency}}\n[[Category:Radio spectrum]]\n[[Category:Television terminology]]"}]}}}}
