For instance, dark glasses attenuate sunlight, lead attenuates [[X-ray]]s, and water attenuates both light and sound.\n\nIn [[electrical engineering]] and [[telecommunication]]s, attenuation affects the [[Wave propagation|propagation of waves]] and [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signals]] in [[electrical circuit]]s, in [[optical fiber]]s, and in air (radio waves). [[Attenuator (electronics)|Electrical attenuator]]s and [[optical attenuator]]s are commonly manufactured components in this field.\n\n== Background ==\n[[Image:Micrwavattrp.png|thumb|Frequency-dependent attenuation of electromagnetic radiation in standard atmosphere.]]\nIn many cases, attenuation is an [[exponential function]] of the path length through the medium. In chemical [[spectroscopy]], this is known as the [[Beer\u2013Lambert law]]. In engineering, attenuation is usually measured in units of [[decibel]]s per unit length of medium (dB/cm, dB/km, etc.) and is represented by the attenuation [[coefficient]] of the medium in question.<ref name=Zagzebski>Essentials of Ultrasound Physics, James A. Zagzebski, Mosby Inc., 1996.</ref> Attenuation also occurs in [[earthquake]]s; when the [[seismic waves]] move farther away from the [[epicenter]], they grow smaller as they are attenuated by the [[Earth|ground]].\n\n==Ultrasound==\n{{main|Acoustic attenuation}}\nOne area of research in which attenuation figures strongly is in [[ultrasound]] physics. Attenuation in ultrasound is the reduction in amplitude of the ultrasound beam as a function of distance through the imaging medium. Accounting for attenuation effects in ultrasound is important because a reduced signal amplitude can affect the quality of the image produced. By knowing the attenuation that an ultrasound beam experiences traveling through a medium, one can adjust the input signal amplitude to compensate for any loss of energy at the desired imaging depth.<ref name=\"Bushong\">Diagnostic Ultrasound, Stewart C. Bushong and Benjamin R. Archer, Mosby Inc., 1991.</ref>\n\n*''Ultrasound attenuation'' measurement in [[heterogeneous]] systems, like [[emulsion]]s or [[colloid]]s, yields information on [[particle size distribution]]. There is an ISO standard on this technique.<ref>ISO 20998-1:2006 \"Measurement and characterization of particles by acoustic methods\"</ref>\n*''Ultrasound attenuation'' can be used for [[extensional rheology]] measurement. There are [[acoustic rheometer]]s that employ [[Stokes' law of sound attenuation|Stokes' law]] for measuring [[extensional viscosity]] and [[volume viscosity]].\n\nWave equations which take acoustic attenuation into account can be written on a fractional derivative form, see the article on [[acoustic attenuation]] or e.g. the survey paper.<ref name=\"Nasholm\">S.

The attenuation [[coefficient]] (<math>\\alpha</math>) can be used to determine total attenuation in [[decibel|dB]] in the medium using the following formula:\n\n:<math> \\text{Attenuation} = \\alpha [\\text{dB}/(\\text{MHz} \\cdot \\text{cm})] \\cdot \\ell [\\text{cm}] \\cdot \\text{f}[\\text{MHz}]</math>\n\nAs this equation shows, besides the medium length and attenuation coefficient, attenuation is also linearly dependent on the [[frequency]] of the incident ultrasound beam. Attenuation coefficients vary widely for different media. In biomedical ultrasound imaging however, biological materials and water are the most commonly used media. The attenuation coefficients of common biological materials at a frequency of 1&nbsp;MHz are listed below:<ref name=\"Culjat\">{{cite journal|last1=Culjat |first1=Martin O. |last2=Goldenberg |first2=David |last3=Tewari |first3=Priyamvada |last4=Singh |first4=Rahul S. |year=2010 |title=A Review of Tissue Substitutes for Ultrasound Imaging |journal=Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology |volume=36 |pmid=20510184 |issue=6 |pages=861\u2013873 |url=http://www.umbjournal.org/article/S0301-5629(10)00075-X |doi=10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2010.02.012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!

F. and Huffman, D.R. \"Absorption and Scattering of Light by Small Particles\", Wiley, (1983), ISBN 0-471-29340-7</ref>\nUltrasound propagation through [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] media is associated only with absorption and can be characterized with [[absorption coefficient]] only. Propagation through [[heterogeneous]] media requires taking into account scattering.<ref>Dukhin, A.S. and Goetz, P.J. \"Ultrasound for characterizing colloids\", Elsevier, 2002</ref> Fractional derivative wave equations can be applied for modeling of lossy acoustical wave propagation, see also [[acoustic attenuation]] and Ref.<ref name=\"Nasholm\"/>\n\n==Light attenuation in water==\n[[Shortwave radiation]] emitted from the sun have wavelengths in the [[visible spectrum]] of light that range from 360&nbsp;nm (violet) to 750&nbsp;nm (red). When the sun\u2019s radiation reaches the sea-surface, the shortwave radiation is attenuated by the water, and the intensity of light decreases exponentially with water depth.  The intensity of light at depth can be calculated using the [[Beer-Lambert Law]].\n\nIn clear open waters, visible light is absorbed at the longest wavelengths first. Thus, red, orange, and yellow wavelengths are absorbed at higher water depths, and blue and violet wavelengths reach the deepest in the water column. Because the blue and violet wavelengths are absorbed last compared to the other wavelengths, open ocean waters appear deep-blue to the eye.\n\nIn near-shore (coastal) waters, sea water contains more [[phytoplankton]] than the very clear central ocean waters. [[Chlorophyll]]-a pigments in the phytoplankton absorb light, and the plants themselves scatter light, making coastal waters less clear than open waters. Chlorophyll-a absorbs light most strongly in the shortest wavelengths (blue and violet) of the visible spectrum. In near-shore waters where there are high concentrations of phytoplankton, the green wavelength reaches the deepest in the water column and the color of water to an observer appears green-blue or green.\n\n==Earthquake==\nThe energy with which an [[earthquake]] affects a location depends on the running [[distance]]. The attenuation in the signal of ground motion intensity plays an important role in the assessment of possible strong groundshaking. A [[seismic wave]] loses [[energy]] as it propagates through the [[earth]] (attenuation). This [[phenomenon]] is tied in to the [[Dispersive mass transfer|dispersion]] of the seismic energy with the distance. There are two types of [[Dissipation|dissipated]] energy:\n\n* geometric dispersion caused by distribution of the seismic energy to greater volumes\n* dispersion as heat, also called intrinsic attenuation or anelastic attenuation.\n\n==Electromagnetic==\nAttenuation decreases the intensity of [[electromagnetic radiation]] due to [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] or [[scattering]] of [[photon]]s.  Attenuation does not include the decrease in intensity due to [[inverse-square law]] geometric spreading.  Therefore, calculation of the total change in intensity involves both the inverse-square law and an estimation of attenuation over the path.\n\nThe primary causes of attenuation in matter are the [[photoelectric effect]], [[compton scattering]], and, for photon energies of above 1.022 MeV, [[pair production]].\n\n===Radiography===\nSee [[Attenuation coefficient]].\n\n===Optics===\n{{main|Transparent materials}}\n\nAttenuation in [[fiber optics]], also known as transmission loss, is the reduction in intensity of the light beam (or signal) with respect to distance travelled through a transmission medium. Attenuation coefficients in fiber optics usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the relatively high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission media. The medium is typically a fiber of silica glass that confines the incident light beam to the inside. Attenuation is an important factor limiting the transmission of a digital signal across large distances. Thus, much research has gone into both limiting the attenuation and maximizing the amplification of the optical signal.\nEmpirical research has shown that attenuation in optical fiber is caused primarily by both [[scattering]] and [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]].<ref name=\"Vardeny\">Telecommunications: A Boost for Fibre Optics, Z. Valy Vardeny, Nature 416, 489\u2013491, 2002.</ref>\n\nAttenuation in fiber optics can be quantified using the following equation:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://floti.bell.ac.uk/MATHSPHYSICS/5attenua.htm\n |title=Fibre Optics|publisher=Bell College |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060224231950/http://floti.bell.ac.uk/MATHSPHYSICS/5attenua.htm |archivedate = 2006-02-24}}</ref>\n\n: <math>\\text{Attenuation (dB)} = 10\\times\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\text{Input intensity (W)}}{\\text{Output intensity (W)}}\\right)</math>\n\n==== Light scattering ====\n[[Image:Reflection angles.svg|frame|Specular reflection]]\n[[Image:Diffuse reflection.PNG|thumb|right|Diffuse reflection]]\nThe propagation of light through the core of an optical fiber is based on total internal reflection of the lightwave. Rough and irregular surfaces, even at the molecular level of the glass, can cause light rays to be reflected in many random directions. This type of reflection is referred to as \"[[diffuse reflection]]\", and it is typically characterized by wide variety of reflection angles. Most objects that can be seen with the naked eye are visible due to diffuse reflection. Another term commonly used for this type of reflection is \"[[light scattering]]\". Light scattering from the surfaces of objects is our primary mechanism of physical observation.\n<ref name=\"z\">{{cite journal\n|author=Kerker, M.\n|title=The Scattering of Light (Academic, New York)\n|year=1909\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"y\">{{cite journal\n|author=Mandelstam, L.I.\n|title=Light Scattering by Inhomogeneous Media\n|journal=Zh. Russ. Fiz-Khim. Ova.\n|volume=58 \n|page=381\n|year=1926\n}}</ref>\nLight scattering from many common surfaces can be modelled by [[lambertian reflectance]].\n\nLight scattering depends on the [[wavelength]] of the light being scattered. Thus, limits to spatial scales of visibility arise, depending on the frequency of the incident lightwave and the physical dimension (or spatial scale) of the scattering center, which is typically in the form of some specific microstructural feature. For example, since [[Visible spectrum|visible light]] has a wavelength scale on the order of one [[micrometer]] (one millionth of a meter), scattering centers will have dimensions on a similar spatial scale.\n\nThus, attenuation results from the [[incoherent scattering]] of light at internal [[Interface (matter)|surface]]s and [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]]s. In (poly)crystalline materials such as metals and ceramics, in addition to pores, most of the internal surfaces or interfaces are in the form of [[grain boundaries]] that separate tiny regions of crystalline order. It has recently been shown that, when the size of the scattering center (or grain boundary) is reduced below the size of the wavelength of the light being scattered, the scattering no longer occurs to any significant extent. This phenomenon has given rise to the production of [[transparent materials|transparent ceramic materials]].\n\nLikewise, the scattering of light in optical quality glass fiber is caused by molecular-level irregularities (compositional fluctuations) in the glass structure. Indeed, one emerging school of thought is that a glass is simply the limiting case of a polycrystalline solid. Within this framework, \"domains\" exhibiting various degrees of short-range order become the building-blocks of both metals and alloys, as well as glasses and ceramics. Distributed both between and within these domains are microstructural defects that will provide the most ideal locations for the occurrence of light scattering. This same phenomenon is seen as one of the limiting factors in the transparency of IR missile domes.<ref>Archibald, P.S. and Bennett, H.E., \"Scattering from infrared missile domes\", Opt. Engr., Vol. 17, p.647 (1978)</ref>\n\n==== UV-Vis-IR absorption ====\nIn addition to light scattering, attenuation or signal loss can also occur due to selective absorption of specific wavelengths, in a manner similar to that responsible for the appearance of color. Primary material considerations include both electrons and molecules as follows:\n\n* At the electronic level, it depends on whether the electron orbitals are spaced (or \"quantized\") such that they can absorb a quantum of light (or photon) of a specific wavelength or frequency in the ultraviolet (UV) or visible ranges. This is what gives rise to color.\n* At the atomic or molecular level, it depends on the frequencies of atomic or molecular vibrations or chemical bonds, how close-packed its atoms or molecules are, and whether or not the atoms or molecules exhibit long-range order. These factors will determine the capacity of the material transmitting longer wavelengths in the infrared (IR), far IR, radio and microwave ranges.\n\nThe selective absorption of infrared (IR) light by a particular material occurs because the selected frequency of the light wave matches the frequency (or an integral multiple of the frequency) at which the particles of that material vibrate. Since different atoms and molecules have different natural frequencies of vibration, they will selectively absorb different frequencies (or portions of the spectrum) of infrared (IR) light.\n\n===Applications===\nIn [[optical fiber]]s, attenuation is the rate at which the signal light decreases in intensity.  For this reason, glass fiber (which has a low attenuation) is used for long-distance fiber optic cables; plastic fiber has a higher attenuation and, hence, shorter range.  There also exist [[optical attenuator]]s that decrease the signal in a fiber optic cable intentionally.\n\nAttenuation of light is also important in [[physical oceanography]].  This same effect is an important consideration in [[weather radar#Attenuation|weather radar]], as raindrops absorb a part of the emitted beam that is more or less significant, depending on the wavelength used.\n\nDue to the damaging effects of high-energy photons, it is necessary to know how much energy is deposited in tissue during diagnostic treatments involving such radiation. In addition, gamma radiation is used in [[cancer treatments]] where it is important to know how much energy will be deposited in healthy and in tumorous tissue.\n\n===Radio===\n{{main|Path loss}}\nAttenuation is an important consideration in the modern world of wireless [[telecommunication]].  Attenuation limits the range of radio signals and is affected by the materials a signal must travel through (e.g., air, wood, concrete, rain).  See the article on [[path loss]] for more information on signal loss in wireless communication.\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|3}}\n*[[Acoustic attenuation]]\n*[[Attenuation length]]\n*[[Attenuator (genetics)]]\n*[[Cross section (physics)]]\n*[[Decibel]]\n*[[Electrical impedance]]\n*[[Environmental remediation]] for ''natural attenuation''\n*[[ITU-R P.525]]\n*[[Mean free path]]\n*[[Path loss]]\n*[[Radiation length]]\n*[[Radiography]]\n*[[Rain fade]]\n*[[Wave propagation]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=50em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/XrayMassCoef/cover.html NIST's XAAMDI: X-Ray Attenuation and Absorption for Materials of Dosimetric Interest Database]\n*[http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Xcom/Text/XCOM.html NIST's XCOM: Photon Cross Sections Database]\n*[http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/FFast/Text/cover.html NIST's FAST: Attenuation and Scattering Tables]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080724134756/http://www.qsl.net/vk5br/UwaterComms.htm Underwater Radio Communication]\n\n[[Category:Telecommunications engineering]]\n[[Category:Acoustics]]\n\n[[de:D\u00e4mpfung]] [[ru:\u0417\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435]]"}]}}}}
