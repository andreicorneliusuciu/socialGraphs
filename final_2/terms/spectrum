''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004.  (accessed: January 25, 2008).</ref>) is a condition that is not limited to a specific set of values but can vary infinitely within a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]]. The word was first used scientifically within the field of [[optics]] to describe the [[rainbow]] of colors in [[visible light]] when separated using a [[triangular prism (optics)|prism]]. As scientific understanding of light advanced, it came to apply to the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]].\n\nSpectrum has since been applied by analogy to topics outside of optics. Thus, one might talk about the ''spectrum of [[political spectrum|political opinion]]'', or the ''spectrum of activity'' of a drug, or the ''[[autism spectrum]]''. In these uses, values within a spectrum may not be associated with precisely quantifiable numbers or definitions.  Such uses imply a broad range of conditions or behaviors grouped together and studied under a single title for ease of discussion.\n\nIn most modern usages of ''spectrum'' there is a unifying theme between extremes at either end.  Some older usages of the word did not have a unifying theme, but they led to modern ones through a sequence of events set out below.  Modern usages in mathematics did evolve from a unifying theme, but this may be difficult to recognize.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Wiktionary}}\nIn [[Latin]] ''spectrum'' means \"image\" or \"[[apparitional experience|apparition]]\", including the meaning \"[[Ghost#Terminology|spectre]]\". [[Spectral evidence]] is testimony about what was done by spectres of persons not present physically, or [[hearsay]] evidence about what [[ghost]]s or apparitions of [[Satan]] said. It was used to convict a number of persons of [[witchcraft]] at [[Salem, Massachusetts]] in the late 17th century. The word \"spectrum\" [Spektrum] was strictly used to designate a ghostly optical  [[afterimage]] by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] in his ''[[Theory of Colours (book)|Theory of Colors]]'' and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] in ''[[On Vision and Colors]]''.\n\nThe prefix \"spectro-\" is used to form words relating to spectra. For example, a [[spectrometer]] is a device used to record spectra and [[spectroscopy]] is the use of a spectrometer for [[chemical analysis]].\n\n==Physical science==\n{{see also|Spectrum (disambiguation)#Physical science}}\n\n[[File:EM Spectrum Properties edit.svg|thumb|right|300 px|Diagram illustrating the electromagnetic spectrum]]\nIn the 17th century the word ''spectrum'' was introduced into [[optics]] by [[Isaac Newton]], referring to the range of [[color]]s observed when white light was [[dispersion (optics)|disperse]]d through a [[prism (optics)|prism]]. Soon the term referred to a plot of light [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] or [[power (physics)|power]] as a function of [[frequency]] or [[wavelength]], also known as a ''[[spectral density]] plot''.\n\nThe term ''spectrum'' was expanded to apply to other [[wave]]s, such as [[sound wave]]s that could also be measured as a function of frequency, [[frequency spectrum]] and [[power spectrum]] of a signal. The term now applies to any signal that can be measured or decomposed along a continuous variable such as energy in [[electron spectroscopy]] or mass to charge ratio in [[mass spectrometry]]. Spectrum is also used to refer to a graphical representation of the signal as a function of the dependent variable.\n\n===Electromagnetic spectrum===\n{{Main|Electromagnetic spectrum}}\n[[File:Qsoabs.jpg|thumb|left|Electromagnetic spectrum of a [[quasar]].]]\nElectromagnetic spectrum refers to the full range of all frequencies of [[electromagnetic radiation]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/resources/dictionary.html#E |title=Electromagnetic spectrum|work=Imagine the Universe! Dictionary |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> and also to the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular object. Devices used to measure an electromagnetic spectrum are called [[spectrograph]] or [[spectrometer]]. The [[visible spectrum]] is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that can be seen by the [[human eye]]. The wavelength of visible light ranges from [[1 E-7 m|390 to 700&nbsp;nm]].<ref>{{cite book | title = Biology: Concepts and Applications | author = Cecie Starr | publisher = Thomson Brooks/Cole | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-534-46226-X | url = https://books.google.com/?id=RtSpGV_Pl_0C&pg=PA94}}</ref> The [[absorption spectrum]] of a [[chemical element]] or [[chemical compound]] is the spectrum of frequencies or wavelengths of incident radiation. The [[emission spectrum]] refers to the spectrum of radiation emitted due to an atom or molecule making a [[atomic electron transition|transition]] from a higher to a lower energy state.\n\nLight from many different sources contains various colors, each with its own brightness or intensity.  A rainbow, or [[prism (optics)|prism]], sends these component colors in different directions, making them individually visible at different angles.  A graph of the intensity plotted against the frequency (showing the brightness of each color) is the frequency spectrum of the light.  When all the visible frequencies are present equally, the perceived color of the light is white, and the spectrum is a flat line.  Therefore, flat-line spectrums in general are often referred to as ''white'', whether they represent light or another type of wave phenomenon (sound, for example, or vibration in a structure).\n\nIn radio and telecommunications, the frequency spectrum can be shared among many different broadcasters.  The [[radio spectrum]] is the part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] corresponding to frequencies lower below 300&nbsp;GHz, which corresponds to wavelengths longer than about 1&nbsp;mm. The [[microwave]] spectrum corresponds to frequencies between 300&nbsp;MHz (0.3&nbsp;[[hertz|GHz]]) and 300&nbsp;GHz and wavelengths between one meter and one millimeter.<ref>Pozar, David M. (1993). ''Microwave Engineering'' Addison\u2013Wesley Publishing Company. ISBN 0-201-50418-9.</ref><ref>Sorrentino, R. and Bianchi, Giovanni (2010) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6Hc30XnqdPwC Microwave and RF Engineering]'', John Wiley & Sons, p. 4, ISBN 047066021X.</ref> Each broadcast radio and TV station transmits a wave on an assigned frequency range, called a ''channel''.  When many broadcasters are present, the radio spectrum consists of the sum of all the individual channels, each carrying separate information, spread across a wide frequency spectrum.  Any particular radio receiver will detect a single function of amplitude (voltage) vs. time.  The radio then uses a [[tuned circuit]] or tuner to select a single channel or frequency band and [[modulation|demodulate]] or decode the information from that broadcaster.  If we made a graph of the strength of each channel vs. the frequency of the tuner, it would be the frequency spectrum of the antenna signal.\n\nIn [[astronomy]], [[stellar classification]] is the classification of [[star]]s based on their characteristic electromagnetic spectra.\nThe [[spectral flux density]] is used to represent the spectrum of a light-source, such as a star.\n\nIn [[radiometry]] and [[colorimetry]] (or [[color science]] more generally), the [[spectral power distribution]] (SPD) of a [[light source]] is a measure of the power contributed by each frequency or color in a light source. The light spectrum is usually measured at points (often 31) along the [[visible spectrum]], in wavelength space instead of frequency space, which makes it not strictly a spectral density. Some [[spectrophotometry|spectrophotometers]] can measure increments as fine as one to two [[nanometer]]s. the values are used to calculate other specifications and then plotted to show the spectral attributes of the source. This can be helpful in analyzing the [[color]] characteristics of a particular source.\n\n===Mass spectrum===\n[[File:Titan atmosphere diagram.png|thumb|right|250 px|Mass spectrum of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]'s [[ionosphere]]]]\nA [[mass spectrum]] is a plot of ion abundance as a function of [[mass-to-charge ratio]] that is obtained by a [[mass spectrometer]] instrument.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=mass spectrum|file= M03749}}</ref> The mass spectrum can be used to determine the quantity and [[Mass (mass spectrometry)|mass]] of atoms and molecules. [[Tandem mass spectrometry]] spectra are used to determine molecular structure.\n\n===Energy spectrum{{anchor|Energy}}===\n{{distinguish-redirect|Energy spectrum|Energy spectral density}}\nIn physics, the energy spectrum of a particle is the number of particles or intensity of a particle beam as a function of particle energy. Examples of techniques that produce an energy spectrum are [[alpha-particle spectroscopy]], [[electron energy loss spectroscopy]], and [[mass-analyzed ion-kinetic-energy spectrometry]].\n\n===Spectrogram===\n[[Image:Dolphin1.jpg|thumb|left|300 px|Spectrogram of [[dolphin]] vocalizations.]]\nIn [[acoustics]], a [[spectrogram]] is a visual representation of the frequency spectrum of sound as a function of time or another variable.\n\nA source of sound can have many different frequencies mixed.  A [[Musical tone|musical tone's]] [[timbre]] is characterized by its [[harmonic spectrum]].  Sound in our environment that we refer to as ''noise'' includes many different frequencies.  When a sound signal contains a mixture of all audible frequencies, distributed equally over the audio spectrum, it is called [[white noise]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url = http://www.yourdictionary.com/white-noise\n | title = white noise definition\n | work = yourdictionary.com\n }}</ref>\n\nThe [[spectrum analyzer]] is an instrument which can be used to convert the [[sound|sound wave]] of the musical note into a visual display of the constituent frequencies.  This visual display is referred to as an acoustic [[spectrogram]]. Software based audio spectrum analyzers are available at low cost, providing easy access not only to industry professionals, but also to academics, students and the [[hobbyist]].  The acoustic spectrogram generated by the spectrum analyzer provides an [[acoustic signature]] of the musical note.  In addition to revealing the fundamental frequency and its overtones, the spectrogram is also useful for analysis of the temporal [[ADSR envelope|attack]], [[ADSR envelope|decay]], [[ADSR envelope|sustain]], and [[ADSR envelope|release]] of the musical note.\n\n==Biological science==\n[[Antibiotic]] spectrum of activity is a component of [[Antibiotic#Classes|antibiotic classification]]. A [[broad-spectrum antibiotic]] is active against a wide range of [[bacteria]],<ref>Clayton L. Thomas Editor, Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary 17th ed., 1993 (ISBN 0-8036-8313-8)</ref> whereas a [[narrow-spectrum antibiotic]] is effective against specific families of [[bacteria]].<ref name=Hopkins>S.J.

For example, the [[autism spectrum]] describes a range of conditions classified as [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s.\n\n==Mathematics==\n{{see also|Spectrum (disambiguation)#Mathematics}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the [[spectrum of a matrix]] is the [[multiset]] of the [[eigenvalue]]s of the matrix.\n\nIn functional analysis, the concept of the [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum of a bounded operator]] is a generalization of the eigenvalue concept for matrices.\n\nIn [[algebraic topology]], a [[Spectrum (topology)|spectrum]] is an object representing a [[generalized cohomology theory]].\n\n==Social science==\n[[File:Political-spectrum-multiaxis.png|thumb|A [[Nolan chart]] of the political spectrum using ([[Red#Use by political movements|red leftism]] and [[Blue#Politics|blue rightism]]) coding.]]\nIn [[social science]], [[economic spectrum]] is used to indicate the range of [[social class]].
