Space suits are often worn inside [[spacecraft]] as a safety precaution in case of loss of cabin [[pressure]], and are necessary for [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), work done outside spacecraft. Space suits have been worn for such work in Earth orbit, on the surface of the [[Moon]], and en route back to Earth from the Moon. Modern space suits augment the basic pressure garment with a complex system of equipment and environmental systems designed to keep the wearer comfortable, and to minimize the effort required to bend the limbs, resisting a soft pressure garment's natural tendency to stiffen against the vacuum. A self-contained [[oxygen]] supply and environmental control system is frequently employed to allow complete freedom of movement, independent of the spacecraft.\n\nThree types of spacesuits exist for different purposes: IVA (intravehicular activity), EVA (extravehicular activity), and IEVA (intra/extravehicular activity). IVA suits are meant to be worn inside a pressurized spacecraft, and are therefore lighter and more comfortable. IEVA suits are meant for use inside and outside the spacecraft, such as the [[Gemini space suit|Gemini G4C]] suit. They include more protection from the harsh conditions of space, such as protection from micrometeorites and extreme temperature change. EVA suits, such as the [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit|EMU]], are used outside spacecraft, for either planetary exploration or spacewalks. They must protect the wearer against all conditions of space, as well as provide mobility and functionality.<ref name=thomas/>\n\nSome of these requirements also apply to [[pressure suit]]s worn for other specialized tasks, such as high-altitude reconnaissance flight. Above [[Armstrong limit|Armstrong's line]] (around {{convert|19000|m|ft|abbr=on}}), the atmosphere is so thin that pressurized suits are needed.\n\nThe first full-pressure suits for use at extreme altitudes were designed by individual inventors as early as the 1930s. The first space suit worn by a human in space was the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[SK-1 spacesuit|SK-1]] suit worn by [[Yuri Gagarin]] in 1961.\n\n== Requirements ==\n[[Image:STS-116 spacewalk 1.jpg|thumb|Space suits being used to work on the International Space Station.]]\n\nA space suit must perform several functions to allow its occupant to work safely and comfortably, inside or outside a spacecraft. It must provide:\n* A stable internal pressure. This can be less than earth's atmosphere, as there is usually no need for the space suit to carry [[nitrogen]] (which comprises about 78% of earth's atmosphere and is not used by the body). Lower pressure allows for greater mobility, but requires the suit occupant to breathe pure oxygen for a time before going into this lower pressure, to avoid [[decompression sickness]].\n* Mobility. Movement is typically opposed by the pressure of the suit; mobility is achieved by careful joint design. See the ''[[Space suit#Theories of design|Theories of space suit design]]'' section.\n* Supply of breathable oxygen and elimination of [[carbon dioxide]]; these gases are exchanged with the spacecraft or a [[Primary Life Support System|Portable Life Support System]] (PLSS)\n* Temperature regulation. Unlike on Earth, where heat can be transferred by [[convection]] to the atmosphere, in space, heat can be lost only by [[thermal radiation]] or by [[heat conduction|conduction]] to objects in physical contact with the exterior of the suit. Since the temperature on the outside of the suit varies greatly between sunlight and shadow, the suit is heavily insulated, and air temperature is maintained at a comfortable level.\n* A communication system, with external electrical connection to the spacecraft or PLSS\n* Means of collecting and containing solid and liquid bodily waste (such as a [[Maximum Absorbency Garment]])\n\n=== Secondary requirements ===\n[[File:First Six Women Astronauts with Rescue Ball - GPN-2002-000207.jpg|thumb|From left to right, Margaret R. (Rhea) Seddon, Kathryn D. Sullivan, Judith A. Resnick, Sally K. Ride, Anna L. Fisher, and Shannon W. Lucid{{mdash}}The first six female astronauts of the United States stand with a [[Personal Rescue Enclosure]], a spherical life support ball for emergency transfer of people in space]]\nAdvanced suits better regulate the [[astronaut]]'s temperature with a [[Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment]] (LCVG) in contact with the astronaut's skin, from which the heat is dumped into space through an external radiator in the PLSS.\n\nAdditional requirements for EVA include:\n* Shielding against [[ultraviolet]] radiation\n* Limited shielding against [[particle radiation]]\n* Means to maneuver, dock, release, and/or tether onto a spacecraft\n* Protection against small [[micrometeoroid]]s, some traveling at up to 27,000 kilometers per hour, provided by a puncture-resistant [[Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment]], which is the outermost layer of the suit. Experience has shown the greatest chance of exposure occurs near the [[gravitational field]] of a moon or planet, so these were first employed on the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] lunar EVA suits (see ''[[Space suit#United States suit models|United States suit models]]'' below).\n\nAs part of [[astronautical hygiene]] control (i.e., protecting astronauts from extremes of temperature, radiation, etc.), a space suit is essential for extravehicular activity. The [[Apollo/Skylab A7L]] suit included eleven layers in all: an inner liner, a LCVG, a pressure bladder, a restraint layer, another liner, and a Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment consisting of five aluminized insulation layers and an external layer of white Ortho-Fabric. This space suit is capable of protecting the astronaut from temperatures ranging from {{convert|-156|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|121|\u00b0C}}.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nDuring exploration of the moon or Mars, there will be the potential for lunar/Martian dust to be retained on the space suit. When the space suit is removed on return to the spacecraft, there will be the potential for the dust to contaminate surfaces and increase the risks of inhalation and skin exposure. Astronautical hygienists are testing materials with reduced dust retention times and the potential to control the dust exposure risks during planetary exploration. Novel ingress/egress approaches, such as [[suitport]]s, are being explored as well.\n\nIn [[NASA]] space suits, communications are provided via a cap worn over the head, which includes earphones and a microphone. Due to the coloration of the version used for Apollo and [[Skylab]], which resembled the coloration of the comic strip character [[Snoopy]], these caps became known as \"Snoopy caps.\"\n\n=== Operating pressure ===\n[[Image:Prebreathe.jpg|thumb|200 px|Astronaut [[Steven G. MacLean]] pre-breathes prior to an EVA.]]\nGenerally, to supply enough oxygen for [[Respiratory system|respiration]], a space suit using pure oxygen must have a pressure of about {{convert|32.4|kPa|Torr psi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}, equal to the {{convert|20.7|kPa|Torr psi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} [[partial pressure]] of oxygen in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] at sea level, plus {{convert|5.3|kPa|Torr psi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} {{chem|CO|2}} and {{convert|6.3|kPa|Torr psi|sigfig=2|abbr=on|link=on}} [[water vapor]] pressure, both of which must be subtracted from the [[Pulmonary gas pressures|alveolar pressure]] to get alveolar oxygen partial pressure in 100% oxygen atmospheres, by the [[alveolar gas equation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalrph.com/martin_4_most2.htm |title=The Four Most Important Equations In Clinical Practice |last=Martin |first=Lawrence |website=GlobalRPh |publisher=David McAuley |accessdate=June 19, 2013}}</ref> The latter two figures add to 11.6&nbsp;kPa (87&nbsp;Torr, 1.7&nbsp;psi), which is why many modern space suits do not use {{convert|20.7|kPa|Torr psi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}, but {{convert|32.4|kPa|Torr psi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} (this is a slight overcorrection, as alveolar partial pressures at sea level are slightly less than the former). In space suits that use 20.7&nbsp;kPa, the astronaut gets only 20.7&nbsp;kPa \u2212 11.7&nbsp;kPa = {{convert|9.0|kPa|Torr psi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of oxygen, which is about the alveolar oxygen partial pressure attained at an altitude of {{convert|1860|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. This is about 78% of normal partial pressure of oxygen at sea level{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}, about the same as pressure in a commercial passenger jet aircraft, and is the realistic lower limit for safe ordinary space suit pressurization which allows reasonable capacity for work.\n\nWhen space suits below a specific operating pressure are used from craft that are pressurized to normal atmospheric pressure (such as the [[Space Shuttle]]), this requires astronauts to \"pre-breathe\" (meaning pre-breathe pure oxygen for a period) before donning their suits and depressurizing in the air lock. This procedure purges the body of dissolved nitrogen, so as to avoid decompression sickness due to rapid depressurization from a nitrogen-containing atmosphere.\n\n===Exposure to space without a space suit===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}\n\n{{Main|Space exposure}}\n\nThe human body can briefly survive the hard vacuum of space unprotected,<ref name=\"Bellows2006\">{{cite web |url=http://www.damninteresting.com/outer-space-exposure |title=Outer Space Exposure |last=Bellows |first=Alan |date=November 27, 2006 |website=Damn Interesting |id=Article #237 |accessdate=June 19, 2013}}</ref> despite contrary depictions in some popular [[science fiction]]. Human flesh expands to about twice its size in such conditions, giving the visual effect of a body builder rather than an overfilled balloon. Consciousness is retained for up to 15 seconds as the effects of [[Hypoxia (medical)|oxygen starvation]] set in. No snap freeze effect occurs because all heat must be lost through [[thermal radiation]] or the [[evaporation]] of liquids, and the blood does not boil because it remains pressurized within the body.\n\nIn space, there are many different highly energized [[subatomic particle|subatomic protons]] that will expose the body to extreme radiation. Although these compounds are minimal in amount, their high energy is liable to disrupt essential physical and chemical processes in the body, such as altering DNA or causing cancers. Exposure to radiation can create problems via two methods: the particles can react with water in the human body to produce [[free radicals]] that break DNA molecules apart, or by directly breaking the DNA molecules.<ref name=thomas>{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Kenneth S.|last2=McMann|first2=Harold J.|title=U.S. Spacesuits|date=23 November 2011|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Space Radiation Analysis Group|url=http://srag.jsc.nasa.gov/Index.cfm|website=NASA, Johnson Space Center|publisher=NASA|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nTemperature in space can vary extremely depending on where the sun is. Temperatures from solar radiation can reach up to {{convert|250|\u00b0F}} and lower down to {{convert|-387|\u00b0F|0}}. Because of this, spacesuits must provide proper insulation and cooling.<ref name=thomas/>\n\nThe vacuum in space creates zero pressure, causing the gases and processes in the body to expand. In order to prevent chemical processes in the body from overreacting, it is necessary to develop a suit that counteracts against the pressure in space.<ref name=thomas/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Hanslmeier|first1=Arnold|title=The Sun and Space Weather|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=1402006845|pages=166\u201367|edition=Illustrated}}</ref> The greatest danger is in attempting to hold one's breath before exposure, as the subsequent [[Uncontrolled decompression#Explosive decompression|explosive decompression]] can damage the lungs. These effects have been confirmed through various accidents (including in very-high-altitude conditions, outer space and training [[vacuum chamber]]s).<ref name=\"Bellows2006\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/970603.html |title=Ask an Astrophysicist: Human Body in a Vacuum |website=Image the Universe! |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=December 14, 2008}}</ref> Human skin does not need to be protected from vacuum and is gas-tight by itself. Instead, it only needs to be mechanically compressed to retain its normal shape. This can be accomplished with a tight-fitting elastic body suit and a [[helmet]] for containing [[breathing gas]]es, known as a [[space activity suit]] (SAS).\n\n== Theories of design ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}\nA space suit should allow its user natural unencumbered movement. Nearly all designs try to maintain a constant volume no matter what movements the wearer makes. This is because [[Work (physics)|mechanical work]] is needed to change the volume of a constant pressure system. If flexing a joint reduces the volume of the space suit, then the astronaut must do extra work every time he bends that joint, and he has to maintain a force to keep the joint bent. Even if this force is very small, it can be seriously fatiguing to constantly fight against one's suit. It also makes delicate movements very difficult. The work required to bend a joint is dictated by the formula\n\n:<math>W=\\int_{V_i}^{V_f} \\,P\\,dV</math>\n\nwhere ''V<sub>i</sub>'' and ''V<sub>f</sub>'' are respectively the initial and final volume of the joint, ''P'' is the pressure in the suit, and ''W'' is the resultant work. It is generally true that all suits are more mobile at lower pressures. However, because a minimum internal pressure is dictated by life support requirements, the only means of further reducing work is to minimize the change in volume.\n\nAll space suit designs try to minimize or eliminate this problem. The most common solution is to form the suit out of multiple layers. The bladder layer is a rubbery, airtight layer much like a balloon. The restraint layer goes outside the bladder, and provides a specific shape for the suit. Since the bladder layer is larger than the restraint layer, the restraint takes all of the stresses caused by the pressure inside the suit. Since the bladder is not under pressure, it will not \"pop\" like a balloon, even if punctured. The restraint layer is shaped in such a way that bending a joint causes pockets of fabric, called \"gores,\" to open up on the outside of the joint, while folds called \"convolutes\" fold up on the inside of the joint. The gores make up for the volume lost on the inside of the joint, and keep the suit at a nearly constant volume. However, once the gores are opened all the way, the joint cannot be bent any further without a considerable amount of work.\n\nIn some Russian space suits, strips of cloth were wrapped tightly around the [[astronaut#Russian|cosmonaut]]'s arms and legs outside the space suit to stop the space suit from ballooning when in space.\n\nThe outermost layer of a space suit, the Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment, provides thermal insulation, protection from micrometeoroids, and shielding from harmful [[Sunlight|solar radiation]].\n\nThere are four theoretical approaches to suit design:\n[[Image:AX-5-spacesuit.jpg|thumb|NASA's experimental AX-5 hard-shell space suit (1988)]]\n\n===Soft suits===\nSoft suits typically are made mostly of fabrics. All soft suits have some hard parts, some even have hard joint bearings. Intra-vehicular activity and early EVA suits were soft suits.\n\n===Hard-shell suits===\nHard-shell suits are usually made of metal or composite materials and do not use fabric for joints. Hard suits joints use ball bearings and wedge-ring segments similar to an adjustable elbow of a stove pipe to allow a wide range of movement with the arms and legs. The joints maintain a constant volume of air internally and do not have any counter force. Therefore, the astronaut does not need to exert to hold the suit in any position. Hard suits can also operate at higher pressures which would eliminate the need for an astronaut to pre-breathe oxygen to use a {{convert|34|kPa|psi|abbr=on}} space suit before an EVA from a {{convert|101|kPa|psi|abbr=on}} spacecraft cabin. The joints may get into a restricted or locked position requiring the astronaut to manipulate or program the joint. The NASA [[Ames Research Center]] experimental [[Powered exoskeleton#NASA AX-5 hard shell space suit|AX-5]] hard-shell space suit had a flexibility rating of 95%. The wearer could move into 95% of the positions he or she could while nude.\n\n===Hybrid suits===\nHybrid suits have hard-shell parts and fabric parts. NASA's [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit]] (EMU) uses a fiberglass [[Hard Upper Torso]] (HUT) and fabric limbs. [[ILC Dover]]'s [[I-Suit]] replaces the HUT with a fabric soft upper torso to save weight, restricting the use of hard components to the joint bearings, helmet, waist seal, and rear entry hatch. Virtually all workable space suit designs incorporate hard components, particularly at interfaces such as the waist seal, bearings, and in the case of rear-entry suits, the back hatch, where all-soft alternatives are not viable.\n\n===Skintight suits===\n{{details|Space activity suit}}\nSkintight suits, also known as mechanical counterpressure suits or space activity suits, are a proposed design which would use a heavy elastic body stocking to compress the body. The head is in a pressurized helmet, but the rest of the body is pressurized only by the elastic effect of the suit. This eliminates the constant volume problem, reduces the possibility of a space suit depressurization and gives a very lightweight suit. When not worn, the elastic garments' may appear to be that of clothing for a small child. These suits may be very difficult to put on and face problems with providing a uniform pressure. Most proposals use the body's natural [[perspiration]] to keep cool. Sweat evaporates readily in vacuum and may [[deposition (phase transition)|desublime]] or deposit on objects nearby: optics, sensors, the astronaut's visor, and other surfaces.  The icy film and sweat residue may contaminate sensitive surfaces and affect optical performance.\n\n== Contributing technologies ==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2010}}\nRelated preceding technologies include the [[gas mask]] used in [[World War II]], the [[oxygen mask]] used by pilots of high flying bombers in World War II, the high altitude or vacuum suit required by pilots of the [[Lockheed U-2]] and [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71 Blackbird]], the [[diving suit]], [[rebreather]], [[scuba diving]] gear, and many others.\n\nMany spacesuit designs are taken from the U.S. Air Force suits, which are designed to work in \u201chigh altitude aircraft pressure[s],\u201d<ref name=thomas/> such as the [[Navy Mark IV|Mercury IVA]] suit or the Gemini G4C, or the [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]]s.<ref name=nasa>{{cite web|title=NASA Spacesuits|url=http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/nasa_spacesuit/|website=NASA|publisher=NASA|accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''Gloves Technology'''\n\nThe [[Navy Mark IV|Mercury IVA]], the first U.S. spacesuit design, included lights at the tips of the gloves in order to provide visual aid. As the need for extravehicular activity grew, suits such as the [[Apollo/Skylab A7L|Apollo A7L]] included gloves made of a metal fabric called Chromel-r in order to prevent punctures. In order to retain a better sense of touch for the astronauts, the fingertips of the gloves were made of silicone. With the shuttle program, it became necessary to be able to operate spacecraft modules, so the ACES suits featured gripping on the gloves. EMU gloves, which are used for spacewalks, are heated to keep the astronaut's hands warm. The Phase VI gloves, meant for use with the [[Mark III (space suit)|Mark III suit]], are the first gloves to be designed with \"laser scanning technology, 3D computer modeling, stereo lithography, laser cutting technology and CNC machining.\" <ref group=\"NASA, ILC Dover Inc.\">{{cite journal|last1=Graziosi|first1=David|last2=Stein|first2=James|last3=Ross|first3=Amy|last4=Kosmo|first4=Joseph|title=Phase VI Advanced EVA Glove Development and Certification for the International Space Station|date=21 January 2011}}</ref> This allows for cheaper, more accurate production, as well as increased detail in joint mobility and flexibility.\n\n'''Life Support Technology'''\n\nPrior to the [[Apollo program|Apollo missions]], life support in space suits was connected to the space capsule via an umbilical cord-like device. However, with the Apollo missions, life support was configured into a removable capsule called the [[Primary Life Support System|Portable Life Support System]] that allowed the astronaut to explore the moon without having to be attached to the space craft. The EMU spacesuit, used for spacewalks, allows the astronaut to manually control the internal environment of the suit. The Mark III suit has a backpack filled with about 12 pounds of liquid air, as well as pressurization and heat exchange.<ref name=nasa/>\n\n'''Helmet Technology'''\n\nThe development of the spheroidal dome helmet was key in balancing the need for field of view, pressure compensation, and low weight. One inconvenience with some space suits is the head being fixed facing forwards and being unable to turn to look sideways. Astronauts call this effect \"alligator head.\"\n\n===High-altitude suits===\n[[Image:Herreraspacesuit.jpg|thumb|Space suit designed by military engineer [[Emilio Herrera Linares]] for stratospheric balloon]]\n* [[Evgeniy Chertovsky]] created his full-pressure suit or high-altitude '''\"skafandr\" (\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0444\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440)''' in 1931.

In a suitport system, a rear-entry space suit is attached and sealed against the outside of a spacecraft, such that an astronaut can enter and seal up the suit, then go on EVA, without the need for an airlock or depressurizing the spacecraft cabin. Suitports require less mass and volume than airlocks, provide [[dust]] mitigation, and prevent cross-contamination of the inside and outside environments.

For this reason, the [[Centennial Challenges#Astronaut glove challenge|Centennial Astronaut Glove Challenge]] was created to build a better glove. Competitions have been held in 2007 and 2009, and another is planned. The 2009 contest required the glove to be covered with a micro-meteorite layer.\n\n==In fiction==\n{{details|Spacesuits in fiction}}\nThe oldest space fiction ignored the problems of traveling through a vacuum, and launched its heroes through space without any special protection.  In the later 19th century, however, a more realistic brand of space fiction emerged, in which authors have tried to describe or depict the space suits worn by their characters.  These fictional suits vary in appearance and technology, and range from the highly authentic to the utterly improbable.\n\nA very early fictional account of space suits can be seen in [[Garrett P. Serviss]]' novel ''[[Edison's Conquest of Mars]]'' (1898).  Later comic book series such as [[Buck Rogers]] (1930s) and [[Dan Dare]] (1950s) also featured their own takes on space suit design. Science fiction authors such as [[Robert A. Heinlein]] contributed to the development of fictional space suit concepts.\n\n==See also==\n[[Image:Teddies in Space.jpg|thumb|[[Teddy bears]] lifted to 30,085 metres above sea level on a [[helium]] balloon in a materials experiment by [[CU Spaceflight]] and SPARKS science club.
