Euler angles can be defined by three of these rotations. They can also be defined by elemental [[geometry]] and the geometrical definition demonstrates that three rotations are always sufficient to reach any frame.\n\nThe three elemental rotations may be [[#Extrinsic rotations|extrinsic]] (rotations about the axes ''xyz'' of the original coordinate system, which is assumed to remain motionless), or [[#Intrinsic rotations|intrinsic]] (rotations about the axes of the rotating coordinate system ''XYZ'', solidary with the moving body, which changes its orientation after each elemental rotation).\n\nEuler angles are typically denoted as [[Alpha|&alpha;]], [[Beta|&beta;]], [[Gamma|&gamma;]], or [[Phi|&phi;]], [[Theta|&theta;]], [[Psi (letter)|&psi;]]. Different authors may use different sets of rotation axes to define Euler angles, or different names for the same angles. Therefore, any discussion employing Euler angles should always be preceded by their definition.\n\nWithout considering the possibility of using two different conventions for the definition of the rotation axes (intrinsic or extrinsic), there exist twelve possible sequences of rotation axes, divided in two groups: \n\n* '''Proper Euler angles''' {{math|(''z-x-z, x-y-x, y-z-y, z-y-z, x-z-x, y-x-y'')}}\n* '''Tait\u2013Bryan angles''' {{math|(''x-y-z, y-z-x, z-x-y, x-z-y, z-y-x, y-x-z'')}}. \n\nTait\u2013Bryan angles are also called '''Cardan angles'''; '''nautical angles'''; '''heading, elevation, and bank'''; or '''yaw, pitch, and roll'''. Sometimes, both kinds of sequences are called \"Euler angles\". In that case, the sequences of the first group are called ''proper'' or ''classic'' Euler angles.\n\n==Proper Euler angles==\n[[Image:Eulerangles.svg|right|thumb|300px|Proper Euler angles geometrical definition. The ''xyz'' (fixed) system is shown in blue, the ''XYZ'' (rotated) system is shown in red. The [[line of nodes]] (''N'') is shown in green]]\n\n===Geometrical definition===\n\nThe axes of the original frame are denoted as ''x'',''y'',''z'' and the axes of the rotated frame are denoted as ''X'',''Y'',''Z''. The '''geometrical definition''' (sometimes referred to as static) begins defining the [[line of nodes]] as the intersection of the planes ''xy'' and the ''XY'' (it can also be defined as the common perpendicular to the axes ''z'' and ''Z'' and then written as the vector product N = Z x z). Using it, the three Euler angles can be defined as follows:\n\n*''\u03b1'' (or <math>\\varphi</math>) is the angle between the ''x'' axis and the ''N'' axis (x-convention. It could also be defined between ''y'' and ''N'', called y-convention).\n*''\u03b2'' (or <math>\\theta</math>) is the angle between the ''z'' axis and the ''Z'' axis.\n*''\u03b3'' (or <math>\\psi</math>) is the angle between the ''N'' axis and the ''X'' axis (x-convention).\n\nEuler angles between two reference frames are defined only if both frames have the same [[Orientation (mathematics)|handedness]].\n\n===Definition by intrinsic rotations===\n{{multiple image\n   | width1     = 170\n   | footer    = Any target orientation can be reached, starting from a known reference orientation, using a specific sequence of intrinsic rotations, whose magnitudes are the Euler angles of the target orientation. This example uses the ''z-x\u2032-z\u2033'' sequence.\n   | image1    = euler2a.gif\n   | alt1      =\n   | width2 = 150\n   | image2    = intermediateframes.svg\n   | alt2      =\n   | caption2  =\n  }}\n\nIntrinsic rotations are elemental rotations that occur about the axes of a coordinate system ''XYZ'' attached to a moving body. Therefore they change their orientation after each elemental rotation. The ''XYZ'' system rotates, while ''xyz'' is fixed. Starting with ''XYZ'' overlapping ''xyz'', a composition of three intrinsic rotations can be used to reach any target orientation for ''XYZ''. \n\nEuler angles can be defined by intrinsic rotations. The rotated frame ''XYZ'' may be imagined to be initially aligned with ''xyz'', before undergoing the three elemental rotations represented by Euler angles. Its successive orientations may be denoted as follows:\n\n* ''x-y-z'', or ''x''<sub>0</sub>-''y''<sub>0</sub>-''z''<sub>0</sub> (initial)\n* ''x\u2019-y\u2019-z\u2019'', or ''x''<sub>1</sub>-''y''<sub>1</sub>-''z''<sub>1</sub> (after first rotation)\n* ''x\u2033-y\u2033-z\u2033'', or ''x''<sub>2</sub>-''y''<sub>2</sub>-''z''<sub>2</sub> (after second rotation)\n* ''X-Y-Z'', or ''x''<sub>3</sub>-''y''<sub>3</sub>-''z''<sub>3</sub> (final)\n\nFor the above-listed sequence of rotations, the [[line of nodes]] ''N'' can be simply defined as the orientation of ''X'' after the first elemental rotation. Hence, ''N'' can be simply denoted ''x\u2019''. Moreover, since the third elemental rotation occurs about ''Z'', it does not change the orientation of ''Z''. Hence ''Z'' coincides with ''z\u2033''. This allows us to simplify the definition of the Euler angles as follows:\n\n*''\u03b1'' (or <math>\\varphi</math>) represents a rotation around the ''z'' axis,\n*''\u03b2'' (or <math>\\theta</math>) represents a rotation around the ''x\u2019'' axis, \n*''\u03b3'' (or <math>\\psi</math>) represents a rotation around the ''z\u2033'' axis.\n\n===Definition by extrinsic rotations===\n\nExtrinsic rotations are elemental rotations that occur about the axes of the fixed coordinate system ''xyz''. The ''XYZ'' system rotates, while ''xyz'' is fixed. Starting with ''XYZ'' overlapping ''xyz'', a composition of three extrinsic rotations can be used to reach any target orientation for ''XYZ''. The Euler or Tait-Bryan angles (''\u03b1'', ''\u03b2'', ''\u03b3'') are the amplitudes of these elemental rotations. For instance, the target orientation can be reached as follows:\n\n*The ''XYZ'' system rotates about the ''z'' axis by ''\u03b1''. The ''X'' axis is now at angle ''\u03b1'' with respect to the ''x'' axis.\n*The ''XYZ'' system rotates again about the ''x'' axis by ''\u03b2''. The ''Z'' axis is now at angle \u03b2 with respect to the ''z'' axis.\n*The ''XYZ'' system rotates a third time about the ''z'' axis by ''\u03b3''.\n\nIn sum, the three elemental rotations occur about ''z'', ''x'' and ''z''. Indeed, this sequence is often denoted ''z-x-z'' (or 3-1-3). Sets of rotation axes associated with both proper Euler angles and Tait\u2013Bryan angles are commonly named using this notation (see above for details).\n\n===Conventions===\n\nThere are six possibilities of choosing the rotation axes for proper Euler angles. In all of them, the first and third rotation axes are the same. The six possible sequences are:\n# ''z-x\u2019-z\u2033'' (intrinsic rotations) or ''z-x-z'' (extrinsic rotations)\n# ''x-y\u2019-x\u2033'' (intrinsic rotations) or ''x-y-x'' (extrinsic rotations)\n# ''y-z\u2019-y\u2033'' (intrinsic rotations) or ''y-z-y'' (extrinsic rotations)\n# ''z-y\u2019-z\u2033'' (intrinsic rotations) or ''z-y-z'' (extrinsic rotations)\n# ''x-z\u2019-x\u2033'' (intrinsic rotations) or ''x-z-x'' (extrinsic rotations)\n# ''y-x\u2019-y\u2033'' (intrinsic rotations) or ''y-x-y'' (extrinsic rotations)\n\n\n===Signs and ranges===\nAngles are commonly defined according to the [[right hand rule]]. Namely, they have positive values when they represent a rotation that appears clockwise when looking in the positive direction of the axis, and negative values when the rotation appears counter-clockwise. The opposite convention (left hand rule) is less frequently adopted.\n\nAbout the ranges (using [[Interval_(mathematics)#Notations_for_intervals|interval notation]]):\n*for ''\u03b1'' and ''\u03b3'', the range is defined [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] 2\u03c0 [[radian]]s. For instance, a valid range could be {{closed-open|&minus;\u03c0,\u2009\u03c0}}.\n*for ''\u03b2'', the range covers \u03c0 radians (but can't be said to be modulo \u03c0). For example, it could be {{closed-closed|0,\u2009\u03c0}} or {{closed-closed|&minus;\u03c0/2,\u2009\u03c0/2}}.\n\nThe angles ''\u03b1'', ''\u03b2'' and ''\u03b3'' are uniquely determined except for the singular case that the ''xy'' and the ''XY'' planes are identical, i.e. when the ''z'' axis and the ''Z'' axis have the same or opposite directions. Indeed, if the ''z'' axis and the ''Z'' axis are the same, ''\u03b2''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 and only (''\u03b1''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''\u03b3'') is uniquely defined (not the individual values), and, similarly, if the ''z'' axis and the ''Z'' axis are opposite, ''\u03b2''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u03c0 and only (''\u03b1''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''\u03b3'') is uniquely defined (not the individual values). These ambiguities are known as [[gimbal lock]] in applications.\n\n===Precession, nutation and intrinsic rotation ===\n[[Image:Praezession.svg|thumb|170px|left|Euler basic motions of the Earth. Intrinsic (green), Precession (blue) and Nutation (red)]]\n\n[[Precession]], [[nutation]], and [[rotation|intrinsic rotation]] (spin) are defined as the movements obtained by changing one of the Euler angles while leaving the other two constant. These motions are not expressed in terms of the external frame, or in terms of the co-moving rotated body frame, but in a mixture. They constitute a '''mixed axes of rotation''' system, where the first angle moves the line of nodes around the external axis ''z'', the second rotates around the line of nodes and the third one is an intrinsic rotation around an axis fixed in the body that moves. \n\n{{multiple image\n  | image1    = gimbaleuler.svg\n  | width1    = 180\n  | image2    = gimbaleuler2.svg\n  | width2    = 160\n  | footer    = '''Left:''' A [[gimbal]] set, showing a ''z''-''x''-''z'' rotation sequence. External frame shown in the base. Internal axes in red color. '''Right:''' A simple diagram showing similar Euler angles in a diagram.\n}}\n\nThe static definition implies that:\n*''\u03b1'' represents a rotation around the ''z'' axis,\n*''\u03b2'' represents a rotation around the ''N'' axis, \n*''\u03b3'' represents a rotation around the ''Z'' axis.\n\nIf ''\u03b2'' is zero, there is no rotation about ''N''. As a consequence, ''Z'' coincides with ''z'', ''\u03b1'' and ''\u03b3'' represent rotations about the same axis (''z''), and the final orientation can be obtained with a single rotation about ''z'', by an angle equal to ''\u03b1''+''\u03b3''.\n\nAs an example, consider a [[top]]. The top spins around its own axis of symmetry; this corresponds to its intrinsic rotation. It also rotates around its pivotal axis, with its center of mass orbiting the pivotal axis; this rotation is a precession. Finally, the top can wobble up and down; the inclination angle is the nutation angle. The same example can be seen with the movements of the earth.\n\nThough all three movements can be represented by a rotation operator with constant coefficients in some frame, they cannot be represented by these operators all at the same time. Given a reference frame, at most one of them will be coefficient-free. Only precession can be expressed in general as a matrix in the basis of the space without dependencies of the other angles.\n\nThese movements also behave as a gimbal set. If we suppose a set of frames, able to move each with respect to the former according to just one angle, like a gimbal, there will exist an external fixed frame, one final frame and two frames in the middle, which are called \"intermediate frames\". The two in the middle work as two gimbal rings that allow the last frame to reach any orientation in space.\n\n==Tait\u2013Bryan angles==\n[[Image:taitbrianzyx.svg|thumb|left|200px|Tait\u2013Bryan angles. ''z-y\u2032-x\u2033'' sequence (intrinsic rotations; ''N'' coincides with ''y\u2019''). The angle rotation sequence is ''\u03c8'', ''\u03b8'', ''\u0424''. Note that in this case ''\u03c8 > 90\u00b0'' and ''\u03b8'' is a negative angle.]]\n\nThe second type of formalism is called '''Tait\u2013Bryan angles''', after [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] and [[George H. Bryan]]. It is the convention normally used for aerospace applications, so that zero degrees elevation represents the horizontal attitude. Tait\u2013Bryan angles represent the orientation of the aircraft respect the world frame. When dealing with other vehicles, different [[axes conventions]] are possible.\n\n===Definitions===\n[[Image:taitbrianangles.svg|thumb|right|325px|Tait\u2013Bryan angles. ''z-x\u2019-y\u2033'' sequence (intrinsic rotations; ''N'' coincides with ''x\u2019'')]]\nThe definitions and notations used for Tait-Bryan angles are similar to those described above for proper Euler angles ([[#Geometrical definition|geometrical definition]], [[#Definition by intrinsic rotations|intrinsic rotation definition]], [[#Definition by extrinsic rotations|extrinsic rotation definition]]). The only difference is that Tait\u2013Bryan angles represent rotations about three distinct axes (e.g. ''x-y-z'', or ''x-y\u2019-z\u2033''), while proper Euler angles use the same axis for both the first and third elemental rotations (e.g., ''z-x-z'', or ''z-x\u2019-z\u2033'').\n\nThis implies a different definition for the [[line of nodes]] in the geometrical construction. In the proper Euler angles case it was defined as the intersection between two homologous Cartesian planes (parallel when Euler angles are zero; e.g. ''xy'' and ''XY''). In the second one, it is defined as the intersection of two non-homologous planes (perpendicular when Euler angles are zero; e.g. ''xy'' and ''YZ'').\n\n===Conventions===\n[[File:Plane with ENU embedded axes.svg|thumb|left|100|100|Heading, elevation and bank angles (Z-Y\u2019-X\u2019\u2019) for an aircraft using onboard ENU axes both onboard and for the ground tracking station. The fixed reference frame x-y-z represents such a tracking station. Onboard axes Y and Z are not shown. X shown in green color.]]\n\nThe three elemental rotations may occur either about the axes of the original coordinate system, which remains motionless ([[#Extrinsic rotations|extrinsic rotations]]), or about the axes of the rotating coordinate system, which changes its orientation after each elemental rotation ([[#Intrinsic rotations|intrinsic rotations]]).\n\nThere are six possibilities of choosing the rotation axes for Tait\u2013Bryan angles. The six possible sequences are:\n* ''x-y\u2019-z\u2033'' (intrinsic rotations) or ''x-y-z'' (extrinsic rotations)\n* ''y-z\u2019-x\u2033'' (intrinsic rotations) or ''y-z-x'' (extrinsic rotations)\n* ''z-x\u2019-y\u2033'' (intrinsic rotations) or ''z-x-y'' (extrinsic rotations)\n* ''x-z\u2019-y\u2033'' (intrinsic rotations) or ''x-z-y'' (extrinsic rotations)\n* ''z-y\u2019-x\u2033'' (intrinsic rotations) or ''z-y-x'' (extrinsic rotations): the intrinsic rotations are known as: yaw, pitch and roll\n* ''y-x\u2019-z\u2033'' (intrinsic rotations) or ''y-x-z'' (extrinsic rotations)\n\n===Signs and ranges===\n[[Image:Yaw Axis Corrected.svg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Aircraft principal axes|principal axes]] of an aircraft according to the air norm [[Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung|DIN]] 9300. Notice that fixed and mobile frames must be coincident with angles zero. Therefore this norm would force also a compatible [[Axes conventions|axes convention]] in the reference system]]\nTait-Bryan convention is widely used in engineering with different purposes. There are several [[axes conventions]] in practice for choosing the mobile and fixed axes, and these conventions determine the signs of the angles. Therefore signs must be studied in each case carefully.\n\nThe range for the angles &psi; and &phi; covers 2&pi; radians. For &theta; the range covers &pi;.\n\n===Alternative names===\n\nThese angles are normally taken as one in the external reference frame ([[Course (navigation)#Aircraft heading|heading]], [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]]), one in the intrinsic moving frame ([[Banked turn|bank]]) and one in a middle frame, representing an [[Elevation (ballistics)|elevation]] or inclination respect the horizontal plane, which is equivalent to the line of nodes for this purpose.\n\nFor an aircraft, they can be obtained with three rotations around its [[aircraft principal axes|principal axes]] if done in the proper order. A [[Yaw (rotation)|yaw]] will obtain the bearing, a [[Pitching moment|pitch]] will yield the elevation and a roll gives the bank angle. Therefore in aerospace they are sometimes called '''yaw, pitch and roll'''. Notice that this will not work if the rotations are applied in any other order or if the airplane axes start in any position non-equivalent to the reference frame.\n\nTait-Bryan angles, following z-y\u2019-x\u2033 (intrinsic rotations) convention, are also known as '''nautical angles''', because they can be used to describe the orientation of a ship or aircraft, or '''Cardan angles''', after the Italian mathematician and physicist [[Gerolamo Cardano]], who first described in detail the [[Cardan suspension]] and the [[Cardan joint]].\n\n==Angles of a given frame==\n[[Image:EulerProjections.svg|right|thumb|200px|Projections of ''Z'' vector.]]\n[[Image:EulerProjections2.svg|right|thumb|200px|Projections of ''Y'' vector.]]\nA common problem is to find the Euler angles of a given frame. The fastest way to get them is to write the three given vectors as columns of a matrix and compare it with the expression of the theoretical matrix (see later table of matrices). Hence the three Euler Angles can be calculated. Nevertheless, the same result can be reached avoiding matrix algebra and using only elemental geometry. Here we present the results for the two most commonly used conventions: ZXZ for proper Euler angles and ZYX for Tait-Bryan. Notice that any other convention can be obtained just changing  the name of the axes.\n\n===Proper Euler angles===\n\nAssuming a frame with [[unit vector]]s (''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'') given by their coordinates as in the main diagram, it can be seen that:\n\n:<math>\\cos (\\beta) = Z_3.</math>\n\nAnd, since \n:<math>\\sin^2 x = 1 - \\cos^2 x,</math>\nwe have\n:<math>\\sin (\\beta) = \\sqrt {1 - Z_3^2}.</math>\n\nAs <math>Z_2</math> is the double projection of a unitary vector,\n:<math>\\cos(\\alpha) \\cdot \\sin(\\beta) = Z_2,</math>\n:<math>\\cos(\\alpha) = Z_2 / \\sqrt{1 - Z_3^2}.</math>\n\nThere is a similar construction for <math>Y_3</math>, projecting it first over the plane defined by the axis ''z'' and the line of nodes. As the angle between the planes is <math>\\pi/2 - \\beta</math> and <math>\\cos(\\pi/2 - \\beta) = \\sin(\\beta)</math>, this leads to:\n\n:<math>\\sin(\\beta) \\cdot \\cos(\\gamma) = Y_3,</math>\n:<math>\\cos(\\gamma) = Y_3 / \\sqrt{1 - Z_3^2},</math>\n\nand finally, using the [[inverse trigonometric functions|inverse cosine]] function,\n\n:<math>\\alpha = \\arccos(Z_2 / \\sqrt{1 - Z_3^2}),</math>\n:<math>\\beta = \\arccos(Z_3),</math>\n:<math>\\gamma = \\arccos(Y_3 / \\sqrt{1 - Z_3^2}).</math>\n\n===Tait-Bryan angles===\n[[File:Projections_of_Tait-Bryan_angles.svg|thumb|right|projections of X axis after three Tait-Bryan rotations. Notice that theta is a negative rotation around the axis y']]\n\nAssuming a frame with [[unit vector]]s (''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'') given by their coordinates as in this new diagram (notice that the angle theta is negative), it can be seen that:\n\n:<math>\\sin (\\theta) = -X_3</math>\n\nAs before,\n:<math>\\cos^2 x = 1 - \\sin^2 x,</math>\nwe have\n:<math>\\cos (\\theta) = \\sqrt {1 - X_3^2}.</math>\n\nin a way analogous to the former one:\n\n:<math>\\sin(\\psi) = X_2 / \\sqrt{1 - X_3^2}.</math>\n:<math>\\sin(\\phi) = Y_3 / \\sqrt{1 - X_3^2}.</math>\n\nLooking for similar expressions to the former ones:\n\n:<math>\\psi = \\arcsin(X_2 / \\sqrt{1 - X_3^2}),</math>\n:<math>\\theta = \\arcsin(-X_3),</math>\n:<math>\\phi = \\arcsin(Y_3 / \\sqrt{1 - X_3^2}).</math>\n\n===Last remarks===\n\nIt is interesting to note that the inverse sine and cosine functions yield two possible values for the argument. In this geometrical description only one of the solutions is valid. When Euler Angles are defined as a sequence of rotations, all the solutions can be valid, but there will be only one inside the angle ranges. This is because the sequence of rotations to reach the target frame is not unique if the ranges are not previously defined.<ref>[http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~sbbh653/publications/euler.pdf Gregory G. Slabaugh, Computing Euler angles from a rotation matrix]</ref>\n\nFor computational purposes, it may be useful to represent the angles using [[atan2]](y,x). For example in the case of proper Euler angles:\n\n:<math>\\alpha = \\operatorname{atan2}(Z_1 , Z_2),</math>\n:<math>\\gamma = \\operatorname{atan2}(X_3 , Y_3).</math>\n\n==Conversion to other orientation representations==\n{{Main|Rotation formalisms in three dimensions#Conversion formulae between formalisms}}\n\nEuler angles are one way to represent orientations. There are others, and it is possible to change to and from other conventions. Three parameters are always required to describe orientations in a [[dimension|3-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]]. They can be given in several ways, Euler angles being one of them; see [[charts on SO(3)]] for others.\n\nThe most used orientation representation are the [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]], the [[axis-angle]] and the [[quaternion]]s, also known as [[Euler\u2013Rodrigues parameters]], which provide [[Quaternions and spatial rotation|another mechanism]] for representing 3D rotations. This is equivalent to the special unitary group description.\n\nExpressing rotations in 3D as unit quaternions instead of matrices has some advantages:\n* Concatenating rotations is computationally faster and numerically more stable.\n* Extracting the angle and axis of rotation is simpler.\n* Interpolation is more straightforward. See for example [[slerp]].\n* Quaternions do not suffer from [[gimbal lock]] as Euler angles do.\n\nAnyway, the rotation matrix calculation is the first step for obtaining the other two representations.\n\n===Rotation matrix===\n\nAny orientation can be achieved by composing three elemental rotations, starting from a known standard orientation. Equivalently, any [[rotation matrix]] ''R'' can be [[Matrix decomposition|decomposed]] as a product of three elemental rotation matrices. For instance:\n:<math>R = X(\\alpha) Y(\\beta) Z(\\gamma)</math>\nis a rotation matrix that may be used to represent a composition of [[Euler angles#Intrinsic rotations|intrinsic rotations]] about axes ''x-y\u2019-z\u2033''. However, both the definition of the elemental rotation matrices ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'', and their multiplication order depend on the choices taken by the user about the definition of both rotation matrices and Euler angles (see, for instance, [[Rotation matrix#Ambiguities|Ambiguities in the definition of rotation matrices]]). Unfortunately, different sets of conventions are adopted by users in different contexts. The following table was built according to this set of conventions:\n# Each matrix is meant to operate by pre-multiplying [[column vector]]s (see [[Rotation matrix#Ambiguities|Ambiguities in the definition of rotation matrices]])\n# Each matrix is meant to represent an [[Active and passive transformation|active rotation]] (the composing and composed matrices are supposed to act on the coordinates of vectors defined in the initial fixed reference frame and give as a result the coordinates of a rotated vector defined in the same reference frame).\n# Each matrix is meant to represent the composition of [[intrinsic rotations]] (around the axes of the rotating reference frame).\n# [[Right hand rule|Right handed]] reference frames are adopted, and the [[right hand rule]] is used to determine the sign of the angles ''\u03b1'', ''\u03b2'', ''\u03b3''.\nFor the sake of simplicity, the following table uses the following nomenclature:\n# 1, 2, 3 represent the angles ''\u03b1'', ''\u03b2'', ''\u03b3''.\n# ''X, Y, Z'' are the matrices representing the elemental rotations about the axes ''x, y, z'' of the fixed frame (e.g., ''X''<sub>1</sub> represents a rotation about ''x'' by an angle ''\u03b1'').\n# ''s'' and ''c'' represent sine and cosine (e.g., ''s''<sub>1</sub> represents the sine of ''\u03b1'').\n# Each matrix is denoted by the formula used to calculate it. If <math>R = Z_1 X_2 Z_3</math>, we name it <math>Z_1 X_2 Z_3</math>.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color:white;font-weight:bold\"\n|- \n! Proper Euler angles !!

To change the formulas for [[Active and passive transformation|passive rotations]], transpose the matrices (then each matrix transforms the initial coordinates of a vector remaining fixed to the coordinates of the same vector measured in the rotated reference system; same rotation axis, same angles, but now the coordinate system rotates, rather than the vector).\n\n== Properties ==\n{{see also|Charts on SO(3)|Quaternions and spatial rotation}}\nThe Euler angles form a [[chart (topology)|chart]] on all of [[SO(3)]], the [[special orthogonal group]] of rotations in 3D space. The chart is smooth except for a polar coordinate style singularity along ''\u03b2''=0. See [[charts on SO(3)]] for a more complete treatment.\n\nThe space of rotations is called in general \"The [[Quaternions and spatial rotation#Quaternion rotation operations|Hypersphere of rotations]]\", though this is a misnomer: the group [[Spin group|Spin(3)]] is [[isometric embedding|isometric]] to the hypersphere ''S''<sup>3</sup>, but the rotation space SO(3) is instead isometric to the [[real projective space]] '''RP'''<sup>3</sup> which is a 2-fold [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] of the hypersphere. This 2-to-1 ambiguity is the mathematical origin of [[Spin (physics)|spin in physics]].\n\nA similar three angle decomposition applies to [[SU(2)]], the [[special unitary group]] of rotations in complex 2D space, with the difference that ''\u03b2'' ranges from 0 to 2\u03c0. These are also called Euler angles.\n\nThe [[Haar measure]] for Euler angles has the simple form sin(''\u03b2'').''d\u03b1''.''d\u03b2''.''d\u03b3'', usually normalized by a factor of 1/8\u03c0\u00b2.\n\nFor example, to generate uniformly randomized orientations, let ''\u03b1'' and \u03b3 be uniform from 0 to 2\u03c0, let ''z'' be uniform from &minus;1 to 1, and let ''\u03b2'' = arccos(''z'').\n\n===Geometric algebra===\nOther properties of Euler angles and rotations in general can be found from the [[Geometric algebra]](GA). GA is a higher level abstraction, in which the quaternions are an even subalgebra. The principal tool in GA is the rotor <math> \\bold{\\R} = [ \\cos(\\theta / 2) - I u \\sin(\\theta / 2) ] </math> where <math>\\bold\\theta =</math>[[angle of rotation]], <math>\\bold(u) =</math>rotation axis (unitary vector) and <math>\\bold(I)=</math>pseudoscalar (trivector in <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math>)\n\n===Higher dimensions===\n\nIt is possible to define parameters analogous to the Euler angles in dimensions higher than three.<ref>{{it icon}} [http://ansi.altervista.org A generalization of Euler Angles to ''n''-dimensional real spaces]</ref>\n\nThe number of degrees of freedom of a rotation matrix is always less than the dimension of the matrix squared. That is, the elements of a rotation matrix are not all completely independent. For example, the rotation matrix in dimension 2 has only one degree of freedom, since all four of its elements depend on a single angle of rotation. A rotation matrix in dimension 3 (which has nine elements) has three degrees of freedom, corresponding to each independent rotation, for example by its three Euler angles or a magnitude one (unit) quaternion.\n\nIn [[SO(4)]] the rotation matrix [[Rotation (mathematics)#In four dimensions|is defined by two quaternions]], and is therefore 6-parametric (three degrees of freedom for every quaternion). The {{gaps|4|\u00d7|4}} rotation matrices have therefore 6 out of 16 independent components.\n\nAny set of 6 parameters that define the rotation matrix could be considered an extension of Euler angles to dimension 4.\n\nIn general, the number of euler angles in dimension D is quadratic in D; since any one rotation consists of choosing two dimensions to rotate between, the total number of rotations available in dimension <math>D</math> is <math>N_{rot}=\\binom{D}{2}=D(D-1)/2</math>, which for <math>D=2,3,4</math> yields <math>N_{rot}=1,3,6</math>.\n\n== Applications ==\n[[image:Gyroscope operation.gif|thumb|right|A [[gyroscope]] keeps its rotation axis constant. Therefore, angles measured in this frame are equivalent to angles measured in the lab frame]]\n\n===Vehicles and moving frames===\n{{main|rigid body}}\n{{see also|axes conventions}}\n\nTheir main advantage over other orientation descriptions is that they are directly measurable from a gimbal mounted in a vehicle. As gyroscopes keep their rotation axis constant, angles measured in a gyro frame are equivalent to angles measured in the lab frame. Therefore, gyros are used to know the actual orientation of moving spacecraft, and Euler angles are directly measurable. Intrinsic rotation angle cannot be read from a single gimbal, so there has to be more than one gimbal in a spacecraft. Normally there are at least three for redundancy. There is also a relation to the well-known [[gimbal lock]] problem of [[mechanical engineering]] <ref>The relation between the Euler angles and the Cardan suspension is explained in chap. 11.7 of the following textbook: U. Krey, A. Owen, ''Basic Theoretical Physics \u2013 A Concise Overview, New York, London, Berlin, Heidelberg, Springer (2007)&nbsp;.</ref>&nbsp;.\n\nWhen studying rigid bodies in general, one calls the ''xyz'' system ''space coordinates'', and the ''XYZ'' system ''body coordinates''. The space coordinates are treated as unmoving, while the body coordinates are considered embedded in the moving body. Calculations involving [[acceleration]], [[angular acceleration]], [[angular velocity]], [[angular momentum]], and [[kinetic energy]] are often easiest in body coordinates, because then the moment of inertia tensor does not change in time.  If one also diagonalizes the rigid body's moment of inertia tensor (with nine components, six of which are independent), then one has a set of coordinates (called the principal axes) in which the moment of inertia tensor has only three components.\n\nThe angular velocity of a rigid body takes a [[Angular velocity#Components from Euler angles|simple form]] using Euler angles in the moving frame. Also the [[Euler's equations (rigid body dynamics)|Euler's rigid body equations]] are simpler because the inertia tensor is constant in that frame.\n\n===Crystallographic texture===\n[[File:MAUD-MTEX-TiAl-hasylab-2003-Liss.png|thumb|Pole figures displaying crystallographic texture of gamma-TiAl in an alpha2-gamma alloy, as measured by high energy X-rays.<ref name=Liss>{{ cite journal |vauthors=Liss KD, Bartels A, Schreyer A, Clemens H |title=High energy X-rays: A tool for advanced bulk investigations in materials science and physics |journal=Textures Microstruct. |month= |year=2003 |volume=35 |issue=3/4 |pages=219\u201352 |doi=10.1080/07303300310001634952 }}</ref>]]\nIn materials science, crystallographic [[texture (crystalline)|texture]] (or preferred orientation) can be described using Euler angles. In texture analysis, the Euler angles provide a mathematical depiction of the orientation of individual crystallites within a polycrystalline material, allowing for the quantitative description of the macroscopic material.<ref>{{Citation\n  |last1 = Kocks\n  |first1 = U.F.\n |last2 = Tom\u00e9\n  |first2 = C.N.\n |last3 = Wenk\n  |first3 = H.-R.\n  |title = Texture and Anisotropy: Preferred Orientations in Polycrystals and their effect on Materials Properties\n  |publisher = [[Cambridge]]\n  |year = 2000\n  |isbn = 978-0-521-79420-6}}</ref>  \nThe most common definition of the angles is due to Bunge and corresponds to the ''ZXZ'' convention.  It is important to note, however, that the application generally involves axis transformations of tensor quantities, i.e. passive rotations.  Thus the matrix that corresponds to the Bunge Euler angles is the transpose of that shown in the table above.<ref>{{Citation\n  |last = Bunge\n  |first = H.\n  |title = Texture Analysis in Materials Science: Mathematical Methods\n  |publisher = [[CUVILLIER VERLAG]]\n  |year = 1993\n  |asin = B0014XV9HU}}</ref>\n\n===Others===\n[[File:Automation of foundry with robot.jpg|thumb|right|Industrial robot operating in a foundry.]]\nEuler angles, normally in the Tait\u2013Bryan convention, are also used in [[Industrial robot|robotics]] for speaking about the degrees of freedom of a [[Robotic arm|wrist]]. They are also used in [[Electronic stability control]] in a similar way.\n\nGun fire control systems require corrections to gun-order angles (bearing and elevation) to compensate for deck tilt (pitch and roll). In traditional systems, a stabilizing gyroscope with a vertical spin axis corrects for deck tilt, and stabilizes the optical sights and radar antenna. However, gun barrels point in a direction different from the line of sight to the target, to anticipate target movement and fall of the projectile due to gravity, among other factors. Gun mounts roll and pitch with the deck plane, but also require stabilization. Gun orders include angles computed from the vertical gyro data, and those computations involve Euler angles.\n\nEuler angles are also used extensively in the quantum mechanics of angular momentum. In quantum mechanics, explicit descriptions of the representations of ''SO(3)'' are very important for calculations, and almost all the work has been done using Euler angles. In the early history of quantum mechanics, when physicists and chemists had a sharply negative reaction towards abstract group theoretic methods (called the ''Gruppenpest''), reliance on Euler angles was also essential for basic theoretical work.\n\nMany mobile computing devices contain [[accelerometer]]s which can determine these devices' Euler angles with respect to the earth's gravitational attraction.  These are used in applications such as games, [[bubble level]] simulations, and [[kaleidoscope]]s.{{citation needed|reason=accelerometers can measure orientation, yes; is there any evidence they use Euler angles for this?|date=May 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[3D projection]]\n* [[Axis-angle representation]]\n* [[Conversion between quaternions and Euler angles]]\n* [[Euler's rotation theorem]]\n* [[Quaternion]]\n* [[Quaternions and spatial rotation]]\n* [[Rotation formalisms in three dimensions]]\n* [[Spherical coordinate system]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}<!--added under references heading by script-assisted edit-->\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{citation\n |last1= Biedenharn\n |first1= L.
