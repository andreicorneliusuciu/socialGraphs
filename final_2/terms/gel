Gels are defined as a substantially dilute [[cross-link]]ed system, which exhibits no flow when in the steady-state.<ref>Ferry, John D. (1980) ''Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers''. New York: Wiley, ISBN 0471048941.</ref> By weight, gels are mostly liquid, yet they behave like solids due to a three-dimensional cross-linked network within the liquid. It is the crosslinking within the fluid that gives a gel its structure (hardness) and contributes to the adhesive stick ([[Adhesive|tack]]). In this way gels are a dispersion of molecules of a liquid within a solid in which the solid is the continuous phase and the liquid is the discontinuous phase. The word ''gel'' was coined by 19th-century Scottish chemist [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]] by [[clipping (morphology)|clipping]] from ''[[gelatine]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gel |title=Online Etymology Dictionary: gel |last=Harper |first=Douglas |authorlink=Douglas Harper |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |accessdate=2013-12-09}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\nGels consist of a solid three-dimensional network that spans the volume of a liquid medium and ensnares it through [[surface tension]] effects. This internal network structure may result from [[physical bond]]s ('''physical gels''') or [[chemical bond]]s ('''chemical gels'''), as well as [[crystallite]]s or other junctions that remain '''intact''' within the extending fluid. Virtually any fluid can be used as an extender including water ([[hydrogel]]s), oil, and air ([[aerogel]]). Both by weight and volume, gels are mostly fluid in composition and thus exhibit densities similar to those of their constituent liquids. Edible jelly is a common example of a hydrogel and has approximately the density of water.\n\n===Polyionic polymers===\nPolyionic polymers are polymers with an ionic functional group. The ionic charges prevent the formation of tightly coiled polymer chains. This allows them to contribute more to [[viscosity]] in their stretched state, because the stretched-out polymer takes up more space. See [[polyelectrolyte]] for more information.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Hydrogels===\n{{see also |Superabsorbent polymer|Self-healing hydrogels}} \n[[File:Hydrogel micropump.webm|thumb|A [[micropump]] based on a hydrogel bar (4\u00d70.3\u00d70.05 mm size) actuated by applied voltage.

Xerogels usually retain high porosity (15\u201350%) and enormous surface area (150\u2013900 m<sup>2</sup>/g), along with very small [[Porosity|pore]] size (1\u201310&nbsp;nm). When [[solvent]] removal occurs under [[supercritical fluid|supercritical]] conditions, the network does not shrink and a highly porous, low-density material known as an ''[[aerogel]]'' is produced. Heat treatment of a xerogel at elevated temperature produces viscous [[sintering]] (shrinkage of the xerogel due to a small amount of viscous flow) and effectively transforms the porous gel into a dense [[glass]].\n\n=== Nanocomposite hydrogels ===\n[[Nanocomposite hydrogels]]<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Gaharwar|first1=Akhilesh K.|last2=Peppas|first2=Nicholas A.|last3=Khademhosseini|first3=Ali|title=Nanocomposite hydrogels for biomedical applications|journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering|date=March 2014|volume=111|issue=3|pages=441\u2013453|doi=10.1002/bit.25160|pmid=24264728|pmc=3924876}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carrow|first1=James K.|last2=Gaharwar|first2=Akhilesh K.|title=Bioinspired Polymeric Nanocomposites for Regenerative Medicine|journal=Macromolecular Chemistry and Physics|volume=216|issue=3|pages=248\u2013264|date=November 2014|doi=10.1002/macp.201400427}}</ref> are also known as hybrid hydrogels, can be defined as highly hydrated polymeric networks, either physically or covalently crosslinked with each other and/or with nanoparticles or nanostructures. Nanocomposite hydrogels can mimic native tissue properties, structure and microenvironment due to their hydrated and interconnected porous structure. A wide range of nanoparticles, such as carbon-based, polymeric, ceramic, and metallic nanomaterials can be incorporated within the hydrogel structure to obtain nanocomposites with tailored functionality. Nanocomposite hydrogels can be engineered to possess superior physical, chemical, electrical, and biological properties.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Properties==\nMany gels display [[thixotropy]] \u2013 they become fluid when agitated, but resolidify when resting.\nIn general, gels are apparently solid, jelly-like materials. \nBy replacing the liquid with gas it is possible to prepare [[aerogel]]s, materials with exceptional properties including very low density, high specific surface areas, and excellent thermal insulation properties.\n\n==Animal-produced gels==\nSome species secrete gels that are effective in parasite control. For example, the [[long-finned pilot whale]] secretes an enzymatic gel that rests on the outer surface of this animal and helps prevent other organisms from establishing colonies on the surface of these whales' bodies.<ref>Dee, Eileen May; McGinley, Mark and Hogan, C.

Their viscoelastic nature results in the soft tissue component of the body, disparate from the mineral-based hard tissue of the skeletal system. Researchers are actively developing synthetically derived tissue replacement technologies derived from hydrogels, for both temporary [[Implant (medicine)|implants]] (degradable) and permanent implants (non-degradable). A review article on the subject discusses the use of hydrogels for [[nucleus pulposus]] replacement, cartilage replacement, and [[synthetic tissue]] models.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.orthoworld.com/site/index.php/publications/view_article/221558 |title=Injectable Hydrogel-based Medical Devices: \"There's always room for Jell-O\"1 |publisher=Orthoworld.com |date=September 15, 2010 |accessdate=2013-05-19}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nMany substances can form gels when a suitable [[Thickening agent|thickener or gelling agent]] is added to their formula. This approach is common in manufacture of wide range of products, from foods to paints and adhesives.\n\nIn fiber optics communications, a soft gel resembling \"[[hair gel]]\" in viscosity is used to fill the plastic tubes containing the fibers. The main purpose of the gel is to prevent water intrusion if the buffer tube is breached, but the gel also buffers the fibers against mechanical damage when the tube is bent around corners during installation, or flexed. Additionally, the gel acts as a processing aid when the cable is being constructed, keeping the fibers central whilst the tube material is extruded around it.\n\n==Hydrogels for cancer therapy==\nRecently, Conde et al. developed a self-assembled dual-color RNA [[triple-helix]] structure comprising two [[miRNAs]], a miR mimic (tumor suppressor miRNA) and an antagomiR (oncomiR inhibitor) provides outstanding capability to synergistically abrogate tumors.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Conde | first1 = J | last2 = Oliva | first2 = N | last3 = Atilano | first3 = M | last4 = Song | first4 = HS | last5 = Artzi | first5 = N | year = 2015 | title = Self-assembled RNA-triple-helix hydrogel scaffold for microRNA modulation in the tumour microenvironment |  journal = Nat Mater | volume =  15| issue = 3| pages = 353 | page =  | doi = 10.1038/nmat4497 | pmid = 26641016 |bibcode = 2016NatMa..15..353C }}</ref> The authors hypothesized that efficacious delivery of the RNA triple-helix hydrogel nanoconjugates would be achieved by coating the breast tumor with the adhesive hydrogel scaffold that they have previously shown able to enhance the stability of embedded nanoparticles used for local gene and drug delivery using smart [[gold nanobeacons]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Conde | first1 = J | last2 = Oliva | first2 = N | last3 = Artzi | first3 = N | date = Mar 2015 | title = Implantable hydrogel embedded dark-gold nanoswitch as a theranostic probe to sense and overcome cancer multidrug resistance |  journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 112 | issue = 11| pages = E1278\u201387 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1421229112 | pmid = 25733851 |bibcode = 2015PNAS..112E1278C }}</ref>\n\nConjugation of RNA triple-helices to [[dendrimers]] allows the formation of stable triplex [[nanoparticles]], which form an RNA-triple-helix adhesive scaffold on interaction with dextran aldehyde, the latter able to chemically interact and adhere to natural tissue amines in the tumor. The authors also show that the self-assembled RNA-triple-helix conjugates remain functional in vitro and in vivo, and that they lead to nearly 90% levels of tumor shrinkage two weeks post-gel implantation in a triple-negative breast-cancer mouse model. These findings suggest that the RNA-triple-helix hydrogels can be used as an efficient anticancer platform to locally modulate the expression of endogenous miRs in cancer.\n\nThe authors reported on a novel strategy for concomitant oncomiR inhibition and tumor suppressor miR replacement therapy using a RNA triple-helix hydrogel scaffold that affords highly efficacious local anticancer therapy. Self-assembled RNA triple-helix conjugates remain functional in vitro with high selective uptake and control over miR expression compared to their respective single-stranded or double-stranded forms.  Hence, cancer gene delivery systems should provide potent, selective and specific treatment to tumor cells only, unlike the standard delivery of most conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. This approach can be implemented to design self-assembled triplex structures from any other miR combination, or from other genetic materials including antisense DNA or siRNA to treat a range of diseases.\n\nMore recently, Conde et al. took one step-forward and reported that these hydrogels were also optimized and developed as prophylactic patches able to perform gene, chemo and phototherapy in a triple-combination approach to achieve complete tumor resection and prevent tumor recurrence. This study also identifies the molecular and genetic pathways triggered in response to the three therapeutic modalities by tumor gene expression profiling in treated mice.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nmat4707|pmid=27454043|title=Local triple-combination therapy results in tumour regression and prevents recurrence in a colon cancer model|journal=Nature Materials|volume=15|issue=10|pages=1128|year=2016|last1=Conde|first1=Jo\u00e3o|last2=Oliva|first2=Nuria|last3=Zhang|first3=Yi|last4=Artzi|first4=Natalie}}</ref>\nTaken together the studies hydrogels are excellent candidates for a successful strategy of the proposed project and represent a rational treatment strategy following a comprehensive scrutiny of the tumor microenvironment and host response to different therapeutic modalities.\n\n==See also==\n*[[2-Acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid]]\n*[[Hydrocolloid]]\n*[[Gel electrophoresis]], [[Agarose gel electrophoresis]], [[2-D electrophoresis]], [[SDS-PAGE]]\n*[[Gel filtration chromatography]], [[Gel permeation chromatography]]\n*[[Paste (rheology)]]\n*[[Food rheology]]\n*[[Silicone gel]]\n*[[Void (composites)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Gels}}\n{{wiktionary|gel}}\n* [http://goldbook.iupac.org/X06700.html Xerogel (definition)]\n\n{{Dosage forms|state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Physical chemistry]]\n[[Category:Gels| ]]\n[[Category:Drug delivery devices]]\n[[Category:Dosage forms]]\n[[Category:Colloids]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]"}]}}}}
