Privately owned and founded in 1990, Neptec is a [[NASA]] prime contractor, supplying [[Advanced Space Vision System|operational systems]] to both the Space Shuttle and International Space Station programs. Starting in 2000, Neptec began expanding its technology to include active 3D imaging systems and 3D processing software. This work led directly to the development of Neptec's [[Laser Camera System]], which is an operational system used by [[NASA]] to inspect the shuttle's external surfaces during flight.  Building on Laser Camera System technology, Neptec has also developed a 3D imaging and tracking system designed for automated on-orbit rendezvous, inspection and docking.   The [[TriDAR]] combines a high precision, short range triangulation sensor with a long range [[LIDAR]] sensor into the same [[optical path]].\n\n==Laser Camera System==\nThe Laser Camera System (LCS) is short-range, high precision autosynchronous triangulation scanner. The camera uses a laser to measure the distance between itself and points on a target and is able to create a three-dimensional representation of the area it has scanned.\n\nFirst demonstrated on the Shuttle Discovery Mission [[STS-105]] in August 2001, Neptec\u2019s prototype LCS was the first dual target tracking and imaging three-dimensional scanner to fly in space. It wasn\u2019t until 2004, after the [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|tragedy]] that the LCS became a primary focus to both Neptec and NASA.\n\nTo ensure the safety of future missions, NASA required a means to determine the amount of damage, if any, was sustained by a shuttle during the launch phase. In response to this requirement, Neptec Design Group developed the Laser Camera System (LCS) in 14 months. The LCS made its first mission in July 2005 on NASA\u2019s [[STS-114]] Return to Flight shuttle mission and was a mandatory system for subsequent shuttle missions.\n\nThe LCS was part of a larger sensor system that is installed on a 50-foot boom extension that provided additional reach for the [[Remote Manipulator System]] (Canadarm). This [[Orbiter Boom Sensor System]] (OBSS) was used to inspect areas of the shuttle that were previously not visible to the astronauts inside. The LCS was used to scan and characterize the underside of the shuttle while in orbit. While looking at the shuttle\u2019s tiles and panels from the height of a first story window, Neptec\u2019s scanner was able to detect cracks less than a millimeter thick. Because it was a 3D scanner, it was also able to measure the depth of cracks or holes that were found. The scanner then sent these measurements to Earth where the data was analyzed in detail by Neptec engineers in NASA\u2019s Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas.  During STS-114, critical on-orbit data was often processed and in the hands of the Space Shuttle mission managers within an hour of being collected on orbit.\n\nNeptec\u2019s LCS continued to fly as an operational part of the OBSS on the remaining Space Shuttle Missions.\n\n'''Neptec LCS Missions:'''\n\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"2\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #555 solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\"  \n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!
