A person using the map can use a pair of dividers (or, less precisely, two fingers) to measure a distance by comparing it to the linear scale. The length of the line on the linear scale is equal to the distance represented on the earth multiplied by the map or chart's scale.\n\nIn most [[Map projection|projections]], scale varies with [[latitude]], so on small scale maps, covering large areas and a wide range of latitudes, the linear scale must show the scale for the range of latitudes covered by the map. One of these is shown below.\n\nSince most nautical charts are constructed using the [[Mercator projection]] whose scale varies substantially with latitude, linear scales are not used on charts with scales smaller than approximately 1/80,000.<ref name=bowditch02c3/><ref name=dutton/> Mariners generally use the [[nautical mile]], which, because a nautical mile is approximately equal to a minute of latitude, can be measured against the latitude scale at the sides of the chart.\n\nWhile linear scales are used on architectural and engineering drawings, particularly those that are drawn after the subject has been built, many such drawings do not have a linear scale and are marked \"Do Not Scale Drawing\" in recognition of the fact that paper size changes with environmental changes and only dimensions that are specifically shown on the drawing can be used reliably in precise manufacturing.<ref name=dnsd/>\n\n[[File:Moseley Wrought Iron Arch Bridge - North Andover, MA.jpg|thumb|right|Linear scale in both feet and metres in the center of an engineering drawing.
