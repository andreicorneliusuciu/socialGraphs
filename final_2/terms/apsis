The word comes via Latin from Greek and is [[cognate]] with [[apse]].<ref>http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/apsis</ref> For [[elliptic orbit]]s about a larger body, there are two apsides, named with the prefixes ''peri-'' ({{ety||''\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af'' (peri)|near}})  and ''ap-'', or ''apo-'' ({{ety||''\u1f00\u03c0(\u03cc)'' (ap(\u00f3))|away from}}) added to a reference to the thing being orbited.\n* For a body orbiting the [[Sun]], the point of least distance is the [[perihelion]] ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|p|Er|i-|\u02c8|h|i:|l|i|\u0259|n}}), and the point of greatest distance is the [[aphelion]] ({{IPAc-en|\u00e6|p|'|h|i:|l|i|\u0259|n}}).<ref>This is the pronunciation given in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] [https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/aphelion] and other major English dictionaries, and is based on the usual pronunciation of scientific words derived from Greek. However, the pronunciation {{IPAc-en|\u0259|\u02c8|f|i\u02d0|l|\u026a|\u0259|n}} is sometimes met, and is based on the misunderstanding that the 'p' from \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc and the 'h' prefixed to the Greek \u1f25\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 form a single sound.</ref> \n* The terms become '''periastron''' and '''apastron''' when discussing orbits around other stars.\n* For any satellite of [[Earth]] including the [[Moon]] the point of least distance is the '''perigee''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|p|Er|i-|dZ|i:}}) and greatest distance the '''apogee'''.\n* For objects in [[Moon|Lunar]] orbit, the point of least distance is the '''pericynthion''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|p|\u025b|r|\u026a|\u02c8|s|\u026a|n|\u03b8|\u026a|\u0259|n}}) and the greatest distance the '''apocynthion''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u00e6|p|\u0259|\u02c8|s|\u026a|n|\u03b8|\u026a|\u0259|n}}).\n* For any orbits around a center of mass, there are the terms '''pericenter''' and '''apocenter'''. '''Periapsis''' and '''apoapsis''' (or '''apapsis''') are equivalent alternatives.\n\nA straight line connecting the pericenter and apocenter is the ''line of apsides''. This is the major axis of the [[ellipse]], its greatest diameter.  For a two-body system the [[center of mass]] of the system lies on this line at one of the two [[conic section|foci]] of the ellipse. When one body is sufficiently larger than the other it may be taken to be at this focus.  However whether or not this is the case, both bodies are in [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] elliptical orbits each having one focus at the system's center of mass, with their respective lines of apsides being of length inversely proportional to their masses.  Historically, in [[Geocentric model|geocentric systems]], apsides were measured from the center of the Earth. However, in the case of the Moon, the center of mass of the Earth\u2013Moon system, or [[Barycenter|Earth\u2013Moon barycenter]], as the common focus of both the Moon's and Earth's orbits about each other, is about 74% of the way from Earth's center to its surface.\n\nIn [[orbital mechanics]], the apsis technically refers to the distance measured between the [[center of mass|centers of mass]] of the central and orbiting body. However, in the case of [[spacecraft]], the family of terms are commonly used to refer to the orbital [[altitude]] of the spacecraft from the surface of the central body (assuming a constant, standard reference radius).\n\n==Mathematical formulae==\n[[Image:Angular Parameters of Elliptical Orbit.png|thumb|250px|[[Johannes Kepler|Keplerian]] [[orbital elements]]: point ''F'' is at the pericenter, point ''H'' is at the apocenter, and the red line between them is the line of apsides]]\nThese [[formula]]e characterize the pericenter and apocenter of an orbit:\n* Pericenter: maximum speed <math> v_\\mathrm{per} = \\sqrt{ \\tfrac{(1+e)\\mu}{(1-e)a} } \\,</math> at minimum (pericenter) distance <math>r_\\mathrm{per}=(1-e)a\\!\\,</math>\n* Apocenter: minimum speed <math> v_\\mathrm{ap} = \\sqrt{ \\tfrac{(1-e)\\mu}{(1+e)a} } \\,</math> at maximum (apocenter) distance <math>r_\\mathrm{ap}=(1+e)a\\!\\,</math>\n\nwhile, in accordance with [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] (based on the conservation of [[angular momentum]]) and the conservation of energy, these two quantities are constant for a given orbit:\n* [[specific relative angular momentum]] <math>h = \\sqrt{(1-e^2)\\mu a}</math>\n* [[specific orbital energy]] <math>\\varepsilon=-\\frac{\\mu}{2a}</math>\n\nwhere:\n* ''a'' is the [[semi-major axis]], equal to <math>\\frac{r_\\mathrm{per}+r_\\mathrm{ap}}{2}</math>\n* ''\u03bc'' is the [[standard gravitational parameter]]\n* ''e'' is the [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], defined as\n*:<math>e=\\frac{r_\\mathrm{ap}-r_\\mathrm{per}}{r_\\mathrm{ap}+r_\\mathrm{per}}=1-\\frac{2}{\\frac{r_\\mathrm{ap}}{r_\\mathrm{per}}+1}</math>\n\nNote that for conversion from heights above the surface to distances between an orbit and its primary, the radius of the central body has to be added, and conversely.\n\nThe [[arithmetic mean]] of the two limiting distances is the length of the semi-major axis ''a''. The [[geometric mean]] of the two distances is the length of the [[semi-minor axis]] ''b''.\n\nThe geometric mean of the two limiting speeds is\n:<math>\\sqrt{-2\\varepsilon}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{a}}</math>\nwhich is the speed of a body in a circular orbit whose radius is <math>a</math>.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe words \"pericenter\" and \"apocenter\" are often seen, although periapsis/apoapsis are preferred in technical usage.\n\nVarious related terms are used for other [[Celestial body|celestial objects]]. The '-gee', '-helion' and '-astron' and '-galacticon' forms are frequently used in the astronomical literature when referring to the Earth, Sun, stars and the Galactic Center respectively.  The suffix '-jove' is occasionally used for Jupiter, while '-saturnium' has very rarely been used in the last 50 years for Saturn. The '-gee' form is commonly used as a generic 'closest approach to planet' term instead of specifically applying to the Earth. During the [[Apollo program]], the terms ''pericynthion'' and ''apocynthion'' (referencing Cynthia, an alternative name for the Greek Moon goddess [[Artemis]]) were used when referring to the [[Moon]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Apollo 15 Mission Report | work= Glossary | url= http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/a15mr-f.htm | accessdate = October 16, 2009 }}</ref> Regarding black holes, the term ''peri/apomelasma'' (from a Greek root) was used by physicist [[Geoffrey A.

The variation of the seasons is primarily controlled by the annual cycle of the elevation angle of the Sun, which is a result of the tilt of the axis of the Earth measured from the [[plane of the ecliptic]]. The Earth's [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] and other orbital elements are not constant, but vary slowly due to the perturbing effects of the planets and other objects in the solar system. See [[Milankovitch cycles]].\n\nOn a very long time scale, the dates of the perihelion and of the aphelion progress through the seasons, and they make one complete cycle in 22,000 to 26,000 years. There is a corresponding movement of the position of the stars as seen from Earth that is called the [[apsidal precession]]. (This is closely related to the [[axial precession (astronomy)|precession of the axis]].)\n\nCurrently, the Earth reaches perihelion in early January, approximately 14 days after the [[December Solstice]]. At perihelion, the Earth's center is about {{val|0.98329}} [[astronomical unit]]s (AU) or {{convert|147,098,070|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Sun's center.\n\nThe Earth reaches aphelion currently in early July, approximately 14 days after the [[June Solstice]]. The aphelion distance between the Earth's and Sun's centers is currently about {{val|1.01671|u=AU}} or {{convert|152,097,700|km|mi|abbr=on}}.\n\nAstronomers commonly express the timing of perihelion relative to the [[vernal equinox]] not in terms of days and hours, but rather as an angle of orbital displacement, the so-called [[longitude of the pericenter]]. For the orbit of the Earth, this is called the ''longitude of perihelion'', and in 2000 was about 282.895\u00b0. By the year 2010, this had advanced by a small fraction of a degree to about 283.067\u00b0.<ref>[http://data.giss.nasa.gov/ar5/srorbpar.html NASA.gov]</ref>\n\nThe dates and times of the perihelions and aphelions for several past and future years are listed in the following table:<ref name=solex>{{cite web\n |title=Solex by Aldo Vitagliano \n |url=http://chemistry.unina.it/~alvitagl/solex/ \n |accessdate=2012-07-09 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5gOzK38bc?url=http%3A%2F%2Fchemistry.unina.it%2F%7Ealvitagl%2Fsolex%2F \n |archivedate=2009-04-29 \n |df= \n}} (calculated by Solex 11)</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\"\n! rowspan=2 width=50 | Year\n! colspan=2 | Perihelion\n! colspan=2 | Aphelion\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f2f2f2; text-align:center;\" width=81 | Date || style=\"background:#f2f2f2; text-align:center;\" width=70 | Time ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UT]])\n| style=\"background:#f2f2f2; text-align:center;\" width=81 | Date || style=\"background:#f2f2f2; text-align:center;\" width=70 | Time ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UT]])\n|-\n! 2007\n|January 3 || 19:43\n| July 6 || 23:53\n|- \n! 2008\n|January 2 || 23:51\n| July 4 || 07:41\n|- \n! 2009\n|January 4 || 15:30\n| July 4 || 01:40\n|-\n! 2010\n|January 3 || 00:09\n| July 6 || 11:30\n|- \n! 2011\n|January 3 || 18:32\n| July 4 || 14:54\n|- \n! 2012\n|January 5 || 00:32\n| July 5 || 03:32\n|- \n! 2013\n|January 2 || 04:38\n| July 5 || 14:44\n|-\n! 2014\n|January 4 || 11:59\n| July 4 || 00:13\n|- style=\"background-color: {{#ifeq:{{CURRENTYEAR}}|2015|gold}}\"\n! 2015\n|January 4 || 06:36\n| July 6 || 19:40\n|- style=\"background-color: {{#ifeq:{{CURRENTYEAR}}|2016|gold}}\"\n! 2016\n|January 2 || 22:49\n| July 4 || 16:24\n|- style=\"background-color: {{#ifeq:{{CURRENTYEAR}}|2017|gold}}\"\n! 2017\n|January 4 || 14:18\n| July 3 || 20:11\n|- style=\"background-color: {{#ifeq:{{CURRENTYEAR}}|2018|gold}}\"\n! 2018\n|January 3 || 05:35\n| July 6 || 16:47\n|- style=\"background-color: {{#ifeq:{{CURRENTYEAR}}|2019|gold}}\"\n! 2019\n|January 3 || 05:20\n| July 4 || 22:11\n|- style=\"background-color: {{#ifeq:{{CURRENTYEAR}}|2020|gold}}\"\n! 2020\n|January 5 || 07:48\n| July 4 || 11:35\n|}\n\n==Planetary perihelion and aphelion==\n\nThe following table shows the distances of the [[planet]]s and [[dwarf planet]]s from the Sun at their perihelion and aphelion.<ref>NASA planetary comparison chart http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/compare</ref>\n<!-- It's surprising that values are precise to the km, but the data is from NASA... -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\"\n!
