Some are umbrella type organizations which accept many different disciplines, while others are discipline-specific. Many award professional designations, such as [[european engineer]], [[professional engineer]], [[chartered engineer]], [[incorporated engineer]] or similar. There are also many student-run engineering societies, commonly at universities or technical colleges.\n\n==Africa==\n\n===South Africa===\n*[[South African Institute of Electrical Engineers]]\n*[[Engineering Council of South Africa]]\n\n==Americas==\n\n===Canada===\nIn Canada, the term \"engineering society\" sometimes refers to organizations of [[engineering]] students as opposed to professional societies of engineers. The [[Canadian Federation of Engineering Students]], whose membership consists of most of the engineering student societies from across Canada (see below), is the national association of undergraduate engineering student societies in Canada.\n\nCanada also has many [[Engineering traditions in Canada|traditions related to the calling of an engineer]].\n\nThe [[Engineering Institute of Canada]] ([[French language|French]]: l'Institut Canadien des ing\u00e9nieurs) has the following member societies:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eic-ici.ca/member_societies.html |title=Member Societies: The Engineering Institute of Canada |publisher=[[Engineering Institute of Canada]] |accessdate=February 4, 2011}}</ref>\n\n*[[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] (Canadian Branch of the IMechE)\n*Canadian Maritime Section of the [[Marine Technology Society]]\n*[[Canadian Nuclear Society]]\n*[[Canadian Society for Civil Engineering]]\n*[[Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering]]\n\n====Ontario====\n*[[Professional Engineers Ontario]]\n*[[Queen\u2019s Engineering Society|Engineering Society of Queen's University]]\n*[[UOIT Engineering Students' Society]]\n\n===United States===\n*[[Alpha Pi Mu]]\n*[[American Academy of Environmental Engineers]]\n*[[American Association of Engineering Societies]]\n*[[American Helicopter Society]]\n*[[American Indian Council of Architects and Engineers]]\n*[[American Indian Science and Engineering Society]]\n*[[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]]\n*[[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]]\n*[[American Nuclear Society]]\n*[[American Railway Engineering Association]]\n*[[American Society for Engineering Education]]\n*[[American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers]]\n*[[American Society of Civil Engineers]]\n*[[American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers]]\n*[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]]\n*[[American Society of Naval Engineers]]\n*[[American Society of Plumbing Engineers]]\n*[[American Society of Safety Engineers]]\n*[[American Society for Nondestructive Testing]]\n*[[American Welding Society]]\n*[[ASM International (society)|ASM International]]\n*[[Association for Computing Machinery]]\n*[[Audio Engineering Society]]\n*[[Biomedical Engineering Society]]\n*[[Chi Epsilon]]\n*[[Engineering Society of Buffalo]]\n*[[Eta Kappa Nu]]\n*[[Institute of Biological Engineering]]\n*[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]\n*[[Institute of Industrial Engineers]]\n*[[Institute of Transportation Engineers]]\n*[[National Society of Black Engineers]]\n*[[National Society of Professional Engineers]]\n*[[Order of the Engineer]]\n*[[Pi Tau Sigma]]\n*[[Society for the Advancement of Material and Process Engineering]]\n*[[Society of American Military Engineers]]\n*[[Society of Automotive Engineers]]\n*[[Society of Broadcast Engineers]]\n*[[Society of Fire Protection Engineers]]\n*[[Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers]]\n*[[Society of Manufacturing Engineers]]\n*[[Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers]]\n*[[Society of Petroleum Engineers]]\n*[[Society of Women Engineers]]\n*[[Tau Beta Pi]]\n*[[Tire Society]]\n\n== Asia ==\n===Azerbaijan===\n*[[Caspian Engineers Society]]\n\n=== Bangladesh ===\n*[[Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh]]\n*[[Bangladesh Computer Society]]\n\n===China===\n*[[Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering]]\n\n===Hong Kong===\n*[[International Association of Engineers]]\n*[[Hong Kong Institution of Engineers]]\n\n===India===\n* [[Aeronautical Society of India]]\n* [[Computer Society of India]]\n* [[The Institution of Engineers (India)]]\n* [[Institution of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers]]\n* [[Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers]]\n* [[Indian Institution of Industrial Engineering]]\n* [[Society of EMC Engineers (India)]]\n* [[Indian Society for Technical Education]]\n* [[Indian Science Congress Association]]\n* [[Institute of Mechanical Engineers ]]\n\n===Japan===\n*[[Japan Society of Civil Engineers]]\n\n===Malaysia===\n*[http://www.myiem.org.my/ Institution Of Engineers Malaysia (IEM)]\n\n===Philippines===\nIn the [[Philippines]], the [[Professional Regulation Commission]] is a three-man commission attached to the office of the [[president of the Philippines]]. Its mandate is to regulate and supervise the practice of the professionals (except [[Integrated Bar of the Philippines|lawyers]]) who constitute the highly skilled manpower of the country. As the agency-in-charge of the professional sector, the PRC plays a strategic role in developing the corps of professionals for industry, commerce, governance, and the economy.\n\n====Associations Accredited by the Professional Regulation Commission====\n* [[Philippine Institute of Civil Engineers]]\n* [[Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers]]\n\n===Pakistan===\n* [[Pakistan Engineering Council]]\n\n===Saudi Arabia===\n* [[Saudi Council of Engineers]]\n\n===Sri Lanka===\n* [[BCS Sri Lanka Section]]\n* [[Institution of Engineers, Sri Lanka]]\n* [[Institution of Incorporated Engineers, Sri Lanka]]\n\n==Europe==\n*[[European Federation of National Engineering Associations]]\n*[[European Association for Structural Dynamics]]\n\n===Azerbaijan===\n*[[Caspian Engineers Society]]\n\n===Germany===\n*[[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure]]\n\n===Greece===\n* [[Technical Chamber of Greece]]\n\n===Ireland===\n*[[Institution of Engineers of Ireland]]\n*[[Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine]]\n\n===Portugal===\n*[[Ordem dos Engenheiros]]\n\n===Russia===\n*[[Russian Union of Engineers]]\n\n===Turkey===\n*[[Chamber of Computer Engineers of Turkey]]\n*[[Chamber of Electrical Engineers of Turkey]]\n*[[Union of chambers of Turkish engineers and architects]]\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Engineering Council]] is the regulatory body for the engineering profession. The Engineering Council was incorporated by [[Royal Charter]] in 1981 and controls the award of [[chartered engineer]], [[incorporated engineer]], [[engineering technician]] and [[information and communications technology technician]] titles, through licences issued to thirty six recognised Institutions.
