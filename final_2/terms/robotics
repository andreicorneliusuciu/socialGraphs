Robotics deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of [[robot]]s,<ref name=OED>{{cite web|title=robotics|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0714530#m_en_gb0714530|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=4 February 2011}}</ref> as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.\n\nThese technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans. Robots can be used in any situation and for any purpose, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including bomb detection and de-activation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive. Robots can take on any form but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to  replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, and basically anything a human can do. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of [[bio-inspired robotics]].\n\nThe concept of creating machines that can operate [[Autonomous robot|autonomously]] dates back to [[classical times]], but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Nocks | first1 = Lisa | title = The robot : the life story of a technology | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | year = 2007 | location = Westport, CT | accessdate = 2012-01-27}}</ref> Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes, whether [[domestic robot|domestically]], [[industrial robot|commercially]], or [[military robot|militarily]]. Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people such as defusing bombs, finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring mines and shipwrecks. Robotics is also used in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) as a teaching aid.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''robotics'' was derived from the word ''robot'', which was introduced to the public by [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] writer [[Karel \u010capek]] in his play ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]'', which was published in 1920.<ref name=\"KapekWebsite\">{{cite web|url=http://capek.misto.cz/english/robot.html|first=Dominik| last=Zunt|title=Who did actually invent the word \"robot\" and what does it mean?|publisher=The Karel \u010capek website|accessdate=2007-09-11}}</ref> The word ''robot'' comes from the Slavic word ''robota'', which means labour. The play begins in a factory that makes artificial people called ''robots'', creatures who can be mistaken for humans \u2013 very similar to the modern ideas of [[Android (robot)|androids]]. Karel \u010capek himself did not coin the word. He wrote a short letter in reference to an [[etymology]] in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in which he named his brother [[Josef Capek|Josef \u010capek]] as its actual originator.<ref name=\"KapekWebsite\"/>\n\nAccording to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the word ''robotics'' was first used in print by [[Isaac Asimov]], in his [[science fiction]] short story \"Liar!\", published in May 1941 in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]''. Asimov was unaware that he was coining the term; since the science and technology of electrical devices is ''electronics'', he assumed ''robotics'' already referred to the science and technology of robots. In some of Asimov's other works, he states that the first use of the word ''robotics'' was in his short story ''[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]'' ([[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]], March 1942).<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Asimov\n  | first = Isaac\n  | authorlink = Isaac Asimov\n  | title = Gold\n  | publisher =Voyager <!-- was Eos -->\n  | year =1996 <!-- was 2003 --> |origyear=1995 |location=London |isbn=0-00-648202-3 |pages=224\u2013225 |chapter=The Robot Chronicles }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=[[Counting the Eons]] |chapter=4 The Word I Invented |publisher=Doubleday |year=1983 |quote=Robotics has become a sufficiently well developed technology to warrant articles and books on its history and I have watched this in amazement, and in some disbelief, because I invented \u2026 the word }}</ref> However, the original publication of \"Liar!\" predates that of \"Runaround\" by ten months, so the former is generally cited as the word's origin.\n\n==History of robotics==\n{{see also|History of robots}}\nIn 1942 the science fiction writer [[Isaac Asimov]] created his [[Three Laws of Robotics]].\n\nIn 1948 [[Norbert Wiener]] formulated the principles of [[cybernetics]], the basis of practical robotics.\n\nFully [[autonomous]]s only appeared in the second half of the 20th century. The first digitally operated and programmable robot, the [[Unimate]], was installed in 1961 to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them. Commercial and [[industrial robot]]s are widespread today and used to perform jobs more cheaply, more accurately and more reliably, than humans. They are also employed in some jobs which are too dirty, dangerous, or dull to be suitable for humans. Robots are widely used in [[manufacturing]], assembly, packing and packaging, transport, earth and space exploration, surgery, weaponry, laboratory research, safety, and the mass production of consumer and industrial goods.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.thetech.org/exhibits/online/robotics/universal/index.html\n |title=Robotics: About the Exhibition\n |publisher=The Tech Museum of Innovation\n |accessdate=2008-09-15\n}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

For example, a robot designed to travel across heavy dirt or mud, might use [[caterpillar tracks]]. The mechanical aspect is mostly the creator's solution to completing the assigned task and dealing with the physics of the environment around it. Form follows function.\n# Robots have electrical components which power and control the machinery. For example, the robot with [[caterpillar tracks]] would need some kind of power to move the tracker treads. That power comes in the form of electricity, which will have to travel through a wire and originate from a battery, a basic [[electrical circuit]]. Even petrol powered [[machines]] that get their power mainly from petrol still require an electric current to start the combustion process which is why most petrol powered machines like cars, have batteries. The electrical aspect of robots is used for movement (through motors), sensing (where electrical signals are used to measure things like heat, sound, position, and energy status) and operation (robots need some level of [[electrical energy]] supplied to their motors and sensors in order to activate and perform basic operations)\n# All robots contain some level of [[computer programming]] code. A program is how a robot decides when or how to do something. In the caterpillar track example, a robot that needs to move across a muddy road may have the correct mechanical construction, and receive the correct amount of power from its battery, but would not go anywhere without a program telling it to move. Programs are the core essence of a robot, it could have excellent mechanical and electrical construction, but if its program is poorly constructed its performance will be very poor (or it may not perform at all). There are three different types of robotic programs: remote control, artificial intelligence and hybrid. A robot with [[remote control]] programing has a preexisting set of commands that it will only perform if and when it receives a signal from a control source, typically a human being with a remote control. It is perhaps more appropriate to view devices controlled primarily by human commands as falling in the discipline of automation rather than robotics. Robots that use [[artificial intelligence]] interact with their environment on their own without a control source, and can determine reactions to objects and problems they encounter using their preexisting programming. Hybrid is a form of programming that incorporates both AI and RC functions.\n\n== Applications ==\nAs more and more robots are designed for specific tasks this method of classification becomes more relevant. For example, many robots are designed for assembly work, which may not be readily adaptable for other applications. They are termed as \"assembly robots\". For seam welding, some suppliers provide complete welding systems with the robot  i.e. the welding equipment along with other material handling facilities like turntables etc. as an integrated unit. Such an integrated robotic system is called a \"welding robot\" even though its discrete manipulator unit could be adapted to a variety of tasks. Some robots are specifically designed for heavy load manipulation, and are labelled as \"heavy duty robots.\"\n\nCurrent and potential applications include:\n* [[Military robot]]s\n* [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] plans to develop remote controlled machines and expects to develop fully autonomous heavy robots by 2021.[http://www.communistrobot.com/viewblog.php?id=241]  Some [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s already are remote controlled.\n* It was demonstrated that a robot can perform a [[wikt:herding|herding]] [http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/work/stephen.cameron/sheepdog/] task.\n* Robots are increasingly used in manufacturing (since the 1960s). In the auto industry they can amount for more than half of the \"labor\". There are even \"[[Lights out (manufacturing)|lights off]]\" factories such as an IBM keyboard manufacturing factory in Texas that is 100% automated.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.automationworld.com/news-220 |title=Fully automated factories approach reality |date=October 1, 2003 |work=AutomationWorld |first=Jim |last=Pinto}}</ref>\n* Robots such as HOSPI [http://www.mew.co.jp/corp/news/0610/0610-11.htm] are used as [[courier]]s in hospitals ([[hospital robot]]).

Many different types of batteries can be used as a power source for robots. They range from lead\u2013acid batteries, which are safe and have relatively long shelf lives but are rather heavy compared to silver\u2013cadmium batteries that are much smaller in volume and are currently much more expensive. Designing a battery-powered robot needs to take into account factors such as safety, cycle lifetime and [[weight]]. Generators, often some type of internal combustion engine, can also be used. However, such designs are often mechanically complex and need fuel, require heat dissipation and are relatively heavy. A tether connecting the robot to a power supply would remove the power supply from the robot entirely. This has the advantage of saving weight and space by moving all power generation and storage components elsewhere. However, this design does come with the drawback of constantly having a cable connected to the robot, which can be difficult to manage.<ref name=\"Robot Power Sources\">{{cite web|last=Dowling|first=Kevin|title=Power Sources for Small Robots|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/Web/People/motionplanning/papers/sbp_papers/integrated1/dowling_power_sources.pdf|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref> Potential power sources could be:\n* [[Pneumatics|pneumatic]] (compressed gases)\n* [[Solar power]] (using the sun's energy and converting it into electrical power)\n* [[hydraulic]]s (liquids)\n* [[flywheel energy storage]]\n* organic garbage (through [[anaerobic digestion]])\n* [[nuclear power|nuclear]]\n\n===Actuation===\n{{Main article|Actuator}}\n[[File:2005-11-14 ShadowLeg Finished medium.jpg|thumb|A [[robot leg|robotic leg]] powered by [[Pneumatic artificial muscles|air muscles]] ]]\n\nActuators are the \"[[muscle]]s\" of a robot, the parts which convert [[potential energy|stored energy]] into movement. By far the most popular actuators are electric motors that rotate a wheel or gear, and linear actuators that control industrial robots in factories. There are some recent advances in alternative types of actuators, powered by electricity, chemicals, or compressed air.\n\n==== Electric motors ====\n{{Main article|Electric motor}}\nThe vast majority of robots use electric motors, often brushed and brushless DC motors in portable robots or AC motors in industrial robots and [[numerical control|CNC]] machines. These motors are often preferred in systems with lighter loads, and where the predominant form of motion is rotational.\n\n==== Linear actuators ====\n{{Main article|Linear actuator}}\nVarious types of linear actuators move in and out instead of by spinning, and often have quicker direction changes, particularly when very large forces are needed such as with industrial robotics. They are typically powered by compressed air ([[pneumatic actuator]]) or an oil ([[Hydraulic drive system|hydraulic actuator]]).\n\n==== Series elastic actuators ====\nA [[Spring (device)|spring]] can be designed as part of the motor actuator, to allow improved force control.

Electrodes are mounted on the surface of the rigid core and are connected to an impedance-measuring device within the core. When the artificial skin touches an object the fluid path around the electrodes is deformed, producing impedance changes that map the forces received from the object. The researchers expect that an important function of such artificial fingertips will be adjusting robotic grip on held objects.\n\nScientists from several [[Science and technology in Europe|European countries]] and [[Science and technology in Israel#Biomedical engineering|Israel]] developed a [[prosthetic]] hand in 2009, called SmartHand, which functions like a real one\u2014allowing patients to write with it, type on a [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]], play piano and perform other fine movements.

As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences and views from cameras.\n\nIn most practical computer vision applications, the computers are pre-programmed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common.\n\nComputer vision systems rely on image sensors which detect electromagnetic radiation which is typically in the form of either [[Visible spectrum|visible light]] or [[infra-red light]]. The sensors are designed using [[solid-state physics]]. The process by which light propagates and reflects off surfaces is explained using [[optics]]. Sophisticated image sensors even require [[quantum mechanics]] to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Robots can also be equipped with multiple vision sensors to be better able to compute the sense of depth in the environment. Like human eyes, robots' \"eyes\" must also be able to focus on a particular area of interest, and also adjust to variations in light intensities.\n\nThere is a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of [[biological system]], at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learning-based methods developed within computer vision have their background in biology.\n\n====Other====\nOther common forms of sensing in robotics use [[lidar]], [[radar]] and [[sonar]].{{Citation needed| date=December 2011}}\n\n===Manipulation===\n[[File:Automation of foundry with robot.jpg|thumb|right|[[KUKA]] [[industrial robot]] operating in a [[foundry]]]]\n[[File:Puma Robotic Arm - GPN-2000-001817.jpg|thumb|right|Puma, one of the first industrial robots]]\n[[File:Caught Coding (9690512888).jpg|thumb|right|Baxter, a modern and versatile industrial robot developed by [[Rodney Brooks]]]]\n\n{{further information|Mobile manipulator}}\nRobots need to manipulate objects; pick up, modify, destroy, or otherwise have an effect.

Tracked wheels behave as if they were made of hundreds of wheels, therefore are very common for outdoor and military robots, where the robot must drive on very rough terrain. However, they are difficult to use indoors such as on carpets and smooth floors.

Several robots have been made which can walk reliably on two legs, however none have yet been made which are as robust as a human. There has been much study on human inspired walking, such as AMBER lab which was established in 2008 by the Mechanical Engineering Department at Texas A&M University.<ref>[http://www.bipedalrobotics.com AMBER lab]</ref> Many other robots have been built that walk on more than two legs, due to these robots being significantly easier to construct.<ref>[http://www.hexapodrobot.com/index.html Multipod robots easy to construct]</ref><ref>[http://mecatron.rma.ac.be/pub/2005/ISMCR05_verlinden.pdf AMRU-5 hexapod robot]</ref> Walking robots can be used for uneven terrains, which would provide better mobility and energy efficiency than other locomotion methods. Hybrids too have been proposed in movies such as [[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]], where they walk on 2 legs and switch to 4 (arms+legs) when going to a sprint. Typically, robots on 2 legs can walk well on flat floors and can occasionally walk up [[stairway|stairs]]. None can walk over rocky, uneven terrain. Some of the methods which have been tried are:\n\n===== ZMP Technique =====\n{{Main article|Zero Moment Point}}\nThe Zero Moment Point (ZMP) is the algorithm used by robots such as [[Honda]]'s [[ASIMO]]. The robot's onboard computer tries to keep the total [[inertia|inertial forces]] (the combination of [[Earth]]'s [[gravitation|gravity]] and the [[acceleration]] and deceleration of walking), exactly opposed by the floor [[reaction (physics)|reaction force]] (the force of the floor pushing back on the robot's foot). In this way, the two forces cancel out, leaving no [[moment (physics)|moment]] (force causing the robot to rotate and fall over).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://world.honda.com/ASIMO/history/technology2.html|publisher=Honda Worldwide|title=Achieving Stable Walking|accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref> However, this is not exactly how a human walks, and the difference is obvious to human observers, some of whom have pointed out that ASIMO walks as if it needs the [[toilet|lavatory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pootergeek.com/2004/12/funny-walk/|title=Funny Walk|publisher=Pooter Geek|date=2004-12-28|accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://popsci.typepad.com/ces2007/2007/01/asimos_pimp_shu.html |title=ASIMO's Pimp Shuffle|publisher=Popular Science|date=2007-01-09|accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref><ref>[http://motegi.vtec.net/forums/one-message?message_id=131434&news_item_id=129834 Vtec Forum: A drunk robot? thread]</ref> ASIMO's walking algorithm is not static, and some dynamic balancing is used (see below). However, it still requires a smooth surface to walk on.\n\n===== Hopping =====\nSeveral robots, built in the 1980s by [[Marc Raibert]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Leg Laboratory, successfully demonstrated very dynamic walking. Initially, a robot with only one leg, and a very small foot, could stay upright simply by [[wikt:hop|hopping]]. The movement is the same as that of a person on a [[pogo stick]]. As the robot falls to one side, it would jump slightly in that direction, in order to catch itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/leglab/robots/3D_hopper/3D_hopper.html|publisher=MIT Leg Laboratory|title=3D One-Leg Hopper (1983\u20131984)|accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref> Soon, the algorithm was generalised to two and four legs. A bipedal robot was demonstrated running and even performing [[somersault]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/leglab/robots/3D_biped/3D_biped.html|publisher=MIT Leg Laboratory|title=3D Biped (1989\u20131995)}}</ref> A [[quadrupedalism|quadruped]] was also demonstrated which could [[trot (horse gait)|trot]], run, [[Horse gait#Pace|pace]], and bound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/leglab/robots/quadruped/quadruped.html|publisher=MIT Leg Laboratory|title=Quadruped (1984\u20131987)}}</ref> For a full list of these robots, see the MIT Leg Lab Robots page.<ref>[http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/leglab/robots/robots-main-bottom.html Walking Robots]</ref>\n\n===== Dynamic balancing (controlled falling) =====\nA more advanced way for a robot to walk is by using a dynamic balancing algorithm, which is potentially more robust than the Zero Moment Point technique, as it constantly monitors the robot's motion, and places the feet in order to maintain stability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anybots.com/abouttherobots.html|publisher=Anybots|title=About the robots|accessdate=2007-10-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070909132949/http://anybots.com/abouttherobots.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-09}}</ref> This technique was recently demonstrated by [[Trevor Blackwell|Anybots']] Dexter Robot,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anybots.com/|title=Homepage|publisher=Anybots|accessdate=2007-10-23}}</ref> which is so stable, it can even jump.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnTy_smY3sw|title=Dexter Jumps video|publisher=YouTube|date=2007-03-01|accessdate=2007-10-23}}</ref> Another example is the [[Flame (robot)|TU Delft Flame]].\n\n===== Passive dynamics =====\n{{Main article|Passive dynamics}}\nPerhaps the most promising approach utilizes [[passive dynamics]] where the [[momentum]] of swinging limbs is used for greater [[efficient energy use|efficiency]]. It has been shown that totally unpowered humanoid mechanisms can walk down a gentle slope, using only [[gravitation|gravity]] to propel themselves. Using this technique, a robot need only supply a small amount of motor power to walk along a flat surface or a little more to walk up a [[hill]]. This technique promises to make walking robots at least ten times more efficient than ZMP walkers, like ASIMO.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Steve|last=Collins|author2=Wisse, Martijn |author3=Ruina, Andy |author4= Tedrake, Russ |title=Efficient bipedal robots based on passive-dynamic Walkers|journal=Science|issue= 5712|pages=1082\u20131085|date=2005-02-11|url=http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/research/topics/locomotion_and_robotics/papers/efficient_bipedal_robots/efficient_bipedal_robots.pdf\n|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-09-11|doi=10.1126/science.1107799|volume=307|pmid=15718465 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070622225310/http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/research/topics/locomotion_and_robotics/papers/efficient_bipedal_robots/efficient_bipedal_robots.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference|first=Steve|last=Collins|author2=Ruina, Andy |url=http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/research/topics/locomotion_and_robotics/papers/efficient_bipedal_robots/bipedal_walking_robot_cornell.pdf\n|title=A bipedal walking robot with efficient and human-like gait|booktitle=Proc.

According to Dr. Li, the gecko robot could rapidly climb up and down a variety of building walls, navigate through ground and wall fissures, and walk upside-down on the ceiling. It was also able to adapt to the surfaces of smooth glass, rough, sticky or dusty walls as well as various types of metallic materials. It could also identify and circumvent obstacles automatically. Its flexibility and speed were comparable to a natural gecko. A third approach is to mimic the motion of a snake climbing a pole.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.

These robots require some combination of [[Robotic mapping|navigation hardware and software]] in order to traverse their environment. In particular unforeseen events (e.g. people and other obstacles that are not stationary) can cause problems or collisions. Some highly advanced robots such as [[ASIMO]], and [[Mein\u00fc robot]] have particularly good robot navigation hardware and software. Also, [[Intelligent car|self-controlled car]]s, [[Ernst Dickmanns]]' [[driverless car]], and the entries in the [[DARPA Grand Challenge]], are capable of sensing the environment well and subsequently making navigational decisions based on this information. Most of these robots employ a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] navigation device with waypoints, along with [[radar]], sometimes combined with other sensory data such as [[lidar]], [[video camera]]s, and [[inertial guidance system]]s for better navigation between waypoints.\n\n===Human-robot interaction===\n{{main article|Human-robot interaction}}\n[[File:Kismet robot 20051016.jpg|thumb|140px|right|[[Kismet (robot)|Kismet]] can produce a range of facial expressions.]]\nThe state of the art in sensory intelligence for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if we want the robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuum-cleaning the floors. If robots are to work effectively in homes and other non-industrial environments, the way they are instructed to perform their jobs, and especially how they will be told to stop will be of critical importance. The people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics, and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive. Science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through [[speech]], [[gesture]]s, and [[facial expression]]s, rather than a [[command-line interface]]. Although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate, it is unnatural for the robot. It will probably be a long time before robots interact as naturally as the fictional [[C-3PO]], or [[Star Trek|Data of Star Trek, Next Generation]].\n\n==== Speech recognition ====\n{{Main article|Speech recognition}}\nInterpreting the continuous flow of [[sound]]s coming from a human, in [[real-time computing|real time]], is a difficult task for a computer, mostly because of the great variability of [[Manner of articulation|speech]].<ref>J.

For social reasons, [[synthetic voice]] proves suboptimal as a communication medium,<ref>M.L. Walters, D.S. Syrdal, K.L. Koay, K. Dautenhahn, R. te Boekhorst, (2008). ''Human approach distances to a mechanical-looking robot with different robot voice styles''.

In both of these cases, making hand [[gesture]]s would aid the verbal descriptions. In the first case, the robot would be recognizing gestures made by the human, and perhaps repeating them for confirmation. In the second case, the robot police officer would gesture to indicate \"down the road, then turn right\". It is likely that gestures will make up a part of the interaction between humans and robots.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://robots.stanford.edu/papers/waldherr.gestures-journal.pdf|format=PDF|title=A Gesture Based Interface for Human-Robot Interaction|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|author=Waldherr, Romero & Thrun|year=2000| accessdate=2007-10-28}}</ref> A great many systems have been developed to recognize human hand gestures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ls7-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de:81/research/gesture/|title=Vision Based Hand Gesture Recognition Systems|author=Markus Kohler|publisher=University of Dortmund|accessdate=2007-10-28}}</ref>\n\n==== Facial expression ====\n{{Further information|Facial expression}}\nFacial expressions can provide rapid feedback on the progress of a dialog between two humans, and soon may be able to do the same for humans and robots. Robotic faces have been constructed by [[David Hanson (robotics designer)|Hanson Robotics]] using their elastic polymer called [[Frubber]], allowing a large number of facial expressions due to the elasticity of the rubber facial coating and embedded subsurface motors ([[servomechanism|servos]]).<ref>[http://www.hansonrobotics.com/innovations.html Frubber facial expressions]</ref> The coating and servos are built on a metal [[human skull|skull]]. A robot should know how to approach a human, judging by their facial expression and [[body language]]. Whether the person is happy, frightened, or crazy-looking affects the type of interaction expected of the robot. Likewise, robots like [[Kismet (robot)|Kismet]] and the more recent addition, Nexi<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1852747_1854195_1854135,00.html Nexi facial expressions]</ref> can produce a range of facial expressions, allowing it to have meaningful social exchanges with humans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samogden.com/Kismet.html|title=Kismet: Robot at MIT's AI Lab Interacts With Humans|publisher=Sam Ogden|accessdate=2007-10-28}}</ref>\n\n==== Artificial emotions ====\nArtificial emotions can also be generated, composed of a sequence of facial expressions and/or gestures. As can be seen from the movie [[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]], the programming of these artificial emotions is complex and requires a large amount of human observation. To simplify this programming in the movie, presets were created together with a special software program. This decreased the amount of time needed to make the film. These presets could possibly be transferred for use in real-life robots.\n\n==== Personality ====\nMany of the robots of science fiction have a [[Personality psychology|personality]], something which may or may not be desirable in the commercial robots of the future.<ref>[http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~van/GI2005/Posters/GI_abstract.pdf (Park et al. 2005) Synthetic Personality in Robots and its Effect on Human-Robot Relationship]</ref> Nevertheless, researchers are trying to create robots which appear to have a personality:<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5067678 National Public Radio: Robot Receptionist Dishes Directions and Attitude]</ref><ref>[http://viterbi.usc.edu/tools/download/?asset=/assets/023/49186.pdf&name=nsmaja.pdf New Scientist: A good robot has personality but not looks]</ref> i.e. they use sounds, facial expressions, and body language to try to convey an internal state, which may be joy, sadness, or fear. One commercial example is [[Pleo]], a toy robot dinosaur, which can exhibit several apparent emotions.<ref>[http://www.ted.com/talks/caleb_chung_plays_with_pleo#t-17244 Caleb Chung: Playtime with Pleo, your robotic dinosaur friend | Talk Video | TED.com]</ref>\n\n==== Social Intelligence ====\nThe Socially Intelligent Machines Lab of the  [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] researches new concepts of guided teaching interaction with robots. Aim of the projects is a social robot learns task goals from human demonstrations without prior knowledge of high-level concepts. These new concepts are grounded from low-level continuous sensor data through unsupervised learning, and task goals are subsequently learned using a Bayesian approach. These concepts can be used to transfer knowledge to future tasks, resulting in faster learning of those tasks. The results are demonstrated by the robot ''Curi'' who can scoop some pasta from a pot onto a plate and serve the sauce on top.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/article/technology/meet-woman-who-trains-robots-living|title=Meet a woman who trains robots for a living|date=October 31, 2014|author=Jennifer Bogo}}</ref>\n\n==Control==\n[[File:Magnus B. Egerstedt puppet.jpg|thumb|right|[[Puppet Magnus]], a robot-manipulated marionette with complex control systems]]\n[[File:RuBot II.jpg|thumb|right|[[RuBot II]] can resolve manually Rubik cubes]]\n{{Further information|Control system}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}\n\nThe [[machine|mechanical]] structure of a robot must be controlled to perform tasks. The control of a robot involves three distinct phases \u2013 perception, processing, and action ([[robotic paradigms]]). [[Sensor]]s give information about the environment or the robot itself (e.g. the position of its joints or its end effector). This information is then processed to be stored or transmitted, and to calculate the appropriate signals to the actuators ([[Electric motor|motor]]s) which move the mechanical.\n\nThe processing phase can range in complexity. At a reactive level, it may translate raw sensor information directly into actuator commands. [[Sensor fusion]] may first be used to estimate parameters of interest (e.g. the position of the robot's gripper) from noisy sensor data. An immediate task (such as moving the gripper in a certain direction) is inferred from these estimates. Techniques from [[control theory]] convert the task into commands that drive the actuators.\n\nAt longer time scales or with more sophisticated tasks, the robot may need to build and reason with a \"cognitive\" model. Cognitive models try to represent the robot, the world, and how they interact. Pattern recognition and computer vision can be used to track objects. [[Simultaneous localization and mapping|Mapping]] techniques can be used to build maps of the world. Finally, [[motion planning]] and other [[artificial intelligence]] techniques may be used to figure out how to act. For example, a planner may figure out how to achieve a task without hitting obstacles, falling over, etc.\n\n===Autonomy levels===\n[[File:TOPIO 3.jpg|thumb|[[TOPIO]], a [[humanoid robot]], played [[ping pong]] at Tokyo IREX 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-02/ping-pong-playing-terminator|title=A Ping-Pong-Playing Terminator|publisher=Popular Science}}</ref>]]\nControl systems may also have varying levels of autonomy.\n# Direct interaction is used for [[haptic technology|haptic]] or tele-operated devices, and the human has nearly complete control over the robot's motion.\n# Operator-assist modes have the operator commanding medium-to-high-level tasks, with the robot automatically figuring out how to achieve them.\n# An autonomous robot may go for extended periods of time without human interaction. Higher levels of autonomy do not necessarily require more complex cognitive capabilities. For example, robots in assembly plants are completely autonomous, but operate in a fixed pattern.\n\nAnother classification takes into account the interaction between human control and the machine motions.\n# [[Teleoperation]]. A human controls each movement, each machine actuator change is specified by the operator.\n# Supervisory. A human specifies general moves or position changes and the machine decides specific movements of its actuators.\n# Task-level autonomy. The operator specifies only the task and the robot manages itself to complete it.\n# Full autonomy. The machine will create and complete all its tasks without human interaction.\n\n==Robotics research==\n{{Further information|Open-source robotics|Evolutionary robotics|Areas of robotics|Robotics simulator}}\nMuch of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks, but on investigations into new [[Robot#Types of robots|types of robots]], alternative ways to think about or design robots, and new ways to manufacture them but other investigations, such as MIT's [[cyberflora]] project, are almost wholly academic.\n\nA first particular new innovation in robot design is the opensourcing of robot-projects. To describe the level of advancement of a robot, the term \"Generation Robots\" can be used. This term is coined by Professor [[Hans Moravec]], Principal Research Scientist at the [[Carnegie Mellon University]] [[Robotics Institute]] in describing the near future evolution of robot technology. ''First generation'' robots, Moravec predicted in 1997, should have an intellectual capacity comparable to perhaps a [[lizard]] and should become available by 2010. Because the ''first generation'' robot would be incapable of [[learning]], however, Moravec predicts that the ''second generation'' robot would be an improvement over the ''first'' and become available by 2020, with the intelligence maybe comparable to that of a [[mouse]]. The ''third generation'' robot should have the intelligence comparable to that of a [[monkey]]. Though ''fourth generation'' robots, robots with [[human]] intelligence, professor Moravec predicts, would become possible, he does not predict this happening before around 2040 or 2050.<ref>[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]] conversation with Professor Moravec, October, 1997. ''[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/robots/moravec.html NOVA Online]''</ref>\n\nThe second is [[Evolutionary robotics|evolutionary robots]]. This is a [[methodology]] that uses [[evolutionary computation]] to help design robots, especially the body form, or motion and behavior [[controller (control theory)|controllers]]. In a similar way to [[evolution|natural evolution]], a large population of robots is allowed to compete in some way, or their ability to perform a task is measured using a [[fitness function]]. Those that perform worst are removed from the population, and replaced by a new set, which have new behaviors based on those of the winners. Over time the population improves, and eventually a satisfactory robot may appear. This happens without any direct programming of the robots by the researchers. Researchers use this method both to create better robots,<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2002/09/54900|publisher=Wired Magazine|title=A Theory of Evolution, for Robots|first=Lakshmi|last=Sandhana|date=2002-09-05|accessdate=2007-10-28}}</ref> and to explore the nature of evolution.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070222155713.htm|publisher=Science Daily|title=Experimental Evolution In Robots Probes The Emergence Of Biological Communication|date=2007-02-24|accessdate=2007-10-28}}</ref> Because the process often requires many generations of robots to be simulated,<ref>{{cite journal|first=Leon|last=\u017dlajpah|title=Simulation in robotics|journal=Mathematics and Computers in Simulation|issue=4|pages=879\u2013897|date=2008-12-15|doi=10.1016/j.matcom.2008.02.017|volume=79}}</ref> this technique may be run entirely or mostly in [[simulation]], then tested on real robots once the evolved algorithms are good enough.<ref>[http://www.trnmag.com/Stories/2004/051904/Evolution_trains_robot_teams_051904.html The Latest Technology Research News: Evolution trains robot teams]</ref> Currently, there are about 10 million industrial robots toiling around the world, and Japan is the top country having high density of utilizing robots in its manufacturing industry.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Dynamics and kinematics===\n{{further information|Kinematics|Dynamics (mechanics)}}\n{{externalvideo|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FHtcR78GA0 How the BB-8 Sphero Toy Works]}}\nThe study of motion can be divided into [[kinematics]] and [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEVnsSy0yF8C&pg=SA2-PA3 |publisher=Rastogi Publications|title=Elements of Physics XI|first=P.K.|last=Agarwal}}</ref> Direct kinematics refers to the calculation of end effector position, orientation, [[velocity]], and [[acceleration]] when the corresponding joint values are known. [[Inverse kinematics]] refers to the opposite case in which required joint values are calculated for given end effector values, as done in path planning. Some special aspects of kinematics include handling of redundancy (different possibilities of performing the same movement), [[collision]] avoidance, and [[Mechanical singularity|singularity]] avoidance. Once all relevant positions, velocities, and accelerations have been calculated using [[kinematics]], methods from the field of [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]] are used to study the effect of [[force]]s upon these movements. Direct dynamics refers to the calculation of accelerations in the robot once the applied forces are known. Direct dynamics is used in [[computer simulation]]s of the robot. [[Inverse dynamics]] refers to the calculation of the actuator forces necessary to create a prescribed end effector acceleration. This information can be used to improve the control algorithms of a robot.\n\nIn each area mentioned above, researchers strive to develop new concepts and strategies, improve existing ones, and improve the interaction between these areas. To do this, criteria for \"optimal\" performance and ways to optimize design, structure, and control of robots must be developed and implemented.\n\n=== Bionics and biomimetics ===\n\n[[Bionics]] and [[biomimetics]] apply the physiology and methods of locomotion of animals to the design of robots.

The idea of this specific competition is that kids start developing knowledge and getting into robotics while playing with Legos since they are 9 years old. This competition is associated with Ni or [[National Instruments]].\n\n===Robotics afterschool programs===\nMany schools across the country are beginning to add robotics programs to their after school curriculum.

In space, defence, security, or the nuclear industry, but also in logistics, maintenance and inspection, autonomous robots are particularly useful in replacing human workers performing dirty, dull or unsafe tasks, thus avoiding workers\u2019 exposures to hazardous agents and conditions and reducing physical, ergonomic and psychosocial risks. For example, robots are already used to perform repetitive and monotonous tasks, to handle radioactive material or to work in explosive atmospheres. In the future, many other highly repetitive, risky or unpleasant tasks will be performed by robots in a variety of sectors like agriculture, construction, transport, healthcare, firefighting or cleaning services.<ref>{{cite news|title=Robotics: Redefining crime prevention, public safety and security|url=http://www.sourcesecurity.com/news/articles/robotics-redefining-crime-prevention-public-safety-security-co-12903-ga-co-14203-ga.21083.html|publisher=SourceSecurity.com}}</ref>\n\nDespite these advances, there are certain skills to which humans will be better suited than machines for some time to come and the question is how to achieve the best combination of human and robot skills. The advantages of robotics include heavy-duty jobs with precision and repeatability, whereas the advantages of humans include creativity, decision-making, flexibility and adaptability. This need to combine optimal skills has resulted in [[collaborative robots]] and humans sharing a common workspace more closely and led to the development of new approaches and standards to guarantee the safety of the \u201cman-robot merger\u201d. Some European countries are including robotics in their national programmes and trying to promote a safe and flexible co-operation between robots and operators to achieve better productivity. For example, the German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ([[BAuA]]) organises annual workshops on the topic \u201chuman-robot collaboration\u201d.\n\nIn future, co-operation between robots and humans will be diversified, with robots increasing their autonomy and human-robot collaboration reaching completely new forms.
