The applied input voltage determines the instantaneous oscillation frequency.  Consequently, [[Modulation|modulating]] signals applied to control input may cause [[frequency modulation]] (FM) or [[phase modulation]] (PM). A VCO may also be part of a [[phase-locked loop]].\n[[image:General Microwave VCO.png|thumb|right|A microwave (12-18 GHz) Voltage Controlled Oscillator]]\n\n==Types of VCO==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}\nVCOs can be generally categorized into two groups based on the type of waveform produced.\n\n* '''Linear''' or '''[[Electronic oscillator#Linear oscillator|harmonic oscillator]]s''' generate a sinusoidal waveform.  Harmonic oscillators in electronics usually consist of a resonator with an amplifier that replaces the resonator losses (to prevent the amplitude from decaying) and isolates the resonator from the output (so the load does not affect the resonator). Some examples of harmonic oscillators are LC-tank oscillators and crystal oscillators. In a voltage-controlled oscillator, a voltage input controls the resonant frequency. A [[varactor]] diode's capacitance is controlled by the voltage across the diode. Consequently, a varactor can be used to change the capacitance (and hence the frequency) of an LC tank. A varactor can also change (\"pull\") the resonant frequency of a crystal resonator.\n* '''Relaxation oscillators''' can generate a sawtooth or triangular waveform. They are commonly used in monolithic integrated circuits (ICs). They can provide a wide range of operational frequencies with a minimal number of external components.  Relaxation oscillator VCOs can have three topologies:  1) grounded-capacitor VCOs, 2) emitter-coupled VCOs, and 3) delay-based ring VCOs.{{dubious|date=February 2013}}<!-- other topologies; other forms such as buzzers and blocking oscillators -->  The first two of these types operate similarly.  The time spent in each state depends on the rate of charge or discharge of a capacitor.  The delay-based ring VCO operates somewhat differently however.  For this type, the gain stages are connected in a ring. The output frequency is then a function of the delay in each stage.\n\nHarmonic oscillator VCOs have these advantages over relaxation oscillators:\n* Frequency stability with respect to temperature, noise, and power supply is much better for harmonic oscillator VCOs.\n* They have good accuracy for frequency control since the frequency is controlled by a crystal or tank circuit.{{dubious|date=February 2013}}<!-- Statement is confused: talking about voltage control input or frequency stability? VCO with high MHz/v can have crappy phase noise. Voltage control input is not controlled by crystal. Frequency can be set by RC. -->\nA disadvantage of harmonic oscillator VCOs is that they cannot be easily implemented in monolithic ICs.{{dubious|date=February 2013}}<!-- sure they can; just that tanks don't have good Q because inductors are crappy --> Relaxation oscillator VCOs are better suited for this technology.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}  Relaxation VCOs are also tunable over a wider range of frequencies.<!-- this should be explained; variable L, C are limited; variable R covers decades.-->\n\n== Control of frequency in VCOs ==\n[[File:Voltage controlled oscillator.svg|thumb|350px|right|Voltage-controlled oscillator schematic - audio]]\n\nA voltage-controlled capacitor is one method of making an LC oscillator vary its frequency in response to a control voltage. Any reverse-biased [[semiconductor]] [[diode]] displays a measure of voltage-dependent capacitance and can be used to change the frequency of an oscillator by varying a control voltage applied to the diode.  Special-purpose variable capacitance [[varactor]] diodes are available with well-characterized wide-ranging values of capacitance. Such devices are very convenient in the manufacture of voltage-controlled oscillators.<ref group=note>A voltage-controlled inductor would be in principle as useful, but such devices are unsatisfactory at the frequencies usually desired.</ref> For low-frequency VCOs, other methods of varying the frequency (such as altering the charging rate of a capacitor by means of a voltage controlled [[current source]]) are used (see [[function generator]]).\n\nThe frequency of a [[ring oscillator]] is controlled by varying either the supply voltage, the current available to each inverter stage,  or the capacitive loading on each stage.\n\n== Voltage-controlled crystal oscillators ==\n\nA ''voltage-controlled [[crystal oscillator]]'' (''VCXO'') is used for fine adjustment of the operating frequency. The frequency of a voltage-controlled crystal oscillator can be varied a few tens of parts per million (ppm), because the high [[Q factor]] of the crystals allows \"pulling\" over only a small range of frequencies.\n\nThere are two reasons for using a VCXO:\n* To adjust the output frequency to match or perhaps be some exact multiple of an accurate external reference.\n* Where the oscillator drives equipment that may generate radio-frequency interference, adding a varying voltage to its control input can disperse the interference spectrum to make it less objectionable (see [[spread spectrum clock]]).\n[[File:SMD Cystal Oscillator TCXO.png|miniature|thumb|A 26 MHz TCVCXO]] \nA ''temperature-compensated VCXO'' (TCVCXO) incorporates components that partially correct the dependence on temperature of the [[resonance|resonant frequency]] of the crystal. A smaller range of voltage control then suffices to stabilize the oscillator frequency in applications where [[temperature]] varies, such as [[heat]] buildup inside a [[transmitter]].\n\nPlacing the oscillator in a temperature-controlled \"oven\" at a constant but higher-than-ambient temperature is another way to stabilize oscillator frequency. High stability crystal oscillator references often place the crystal in an oven and use a voltage input for fine control.<ref>For example, an HP/Agilent 10811 reference oscillator</ref> The temperature is selected to be the ''turnover temperature'': the temperature where small changes do not affect the resonance. The control voltage can be used to occasionally adjust the reference frequency to a [[NIST]] source. Sophisticated designs may also adjust the control voltage over time to compensate for crystal aging.<!-- quadratic curve fit of frequency drift. Whose appnote? -->{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n===Phase-domain equations===\n<!-- this is still messed up -->\nAnalog applications such as [[frequency modulation]] and [[frequency-shift keying]] often need to control an oscillator frequency with an input &mdash; a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). The functional relationship between the control voltage and the output frequency may not be linear, but over small ranges, the relationship is approximately linear, and linear control theory can be used.\n\nReal VCOs (especially those used at [[radio frequency]]) may have [[non-linear]] relationship, but linear control theory models are still useful.  There are devices called voltage-to-frequency converters (VFC). These devices are often designed to be very linear over a wide range of input voltages.\n\nModeling for VCOs is often not concerned with the amplitude or shape (sinewave, triangle wave, sawtooth) but rather its instantaneous phase. In effect, the focus is not on the time-domain signal {{math|''A'' sin(''&omega;t''+''&theta;''<sub>0</sub>)}} but rather the argument of the sine function (the phase). Consequently, modeling is often done in the phase domain.\n\nThe instananeous frequency of a VCO is often modeled as a linear relationship with its instaneous control voltage. The output phase of the oscillator is the integral of the instaneous frequency.\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n f(t)      &= f_0 + K_0 \\cdot \\ v_{\\text{in}}(t) \\\\\n \\theta(t) &= \\int_{-\\infty}^t f(\\tau)\\,d\\tau \\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\n::* <math>f(t) </math> is the instantaneous frequency of the oscillator at time {{mvar|t}} (not the waveform amplitude)\n::* <math>f_0 </math> is the quiescent frequency of the oscillator (not the waveform amplitude)\n::* <math>K_0 </math> is called the oscillator sensitivity, or gain.

Generally low phase noise is preferred in the VCO. The noise present in the control signal and the tuning gain affect the phase noise; high noise or high tuning gain imply more phase noise. Other important elements that determine the phase noise are the transistor's [[flicker noise]] (1/''f'' noise),<ref>[http://www.herley.com/index.cfm?act=product&prd=481 Wideband VCO] from [[Herley Industries|Herley - General Microwave]] - \"For optimum performance, the active element used is a silicon bipolar transistor.

The low frequency flicker noise affects the phase noise because the flicker noise is heterodyned to the oscillator output frequency due to the active devices non-linear transfer function. The effect of flicker noise can be reduced with negative feedback that linearizes the transfer function (for example, [[Common emitter#Emitter degeneration|emitter degeneration]]).\n\nLeeson's expression<ref>{{Citation |last=Leeson |first= D.

The more widely used oscillator of the two is Colpitts and these oscillators are very similar in configuration.\n\nVCOs generally have the lowest [[Q-factor]] of the used oscillators, and so suffer more jitter than the other types.  The jitter can be made low enough for many applications (such as driving an ASIC), in which case VCOs enjoy the advantages of having no off-chip components (expensive) or on-chip inductors (low yields on generic CMOS processes).  These oscillators also have larger tuning ranges than the other kinds, which improves yield and is sometimes a feature of the end product (for instance, the dot clock on a graphics card which drives a wide range of monitors).\n\n== Applications ==\nVCOs are used in:\n* [[Function generator]]s,\n* The production of [[electronic music]], to generate variable tones in [[synthesizer]]s,\n* [[Phase-locked loop]]s,\n* [[Frequency synthesizer]]s used in communication equipment.\n\nVoltage-to-Frequency converters are voltage-controlled oscillators, with a highly linear relation between applied voltage and frequency.  They are used to convert a slow analog signal (such as from a temperature transducer) to a digital signal for transmission over a long distance, since the frequency will not drift or be affected by noise. VCOs may have sine and/or square wave outputs. Function generators are low-frequency oscillators which feature multiple waveforms, typically sine, square, and triangle waves. Monolithic function generators are voltage-controlled. Analog phase-locked loops typically contain VCOs. High-frequency VCOs are usually used in [[phase-locked loop]]s for radio receivers. Phase noise is the most important specification for them. Low-frequency VCOs are used in analog music synthesizers. For these, sweep range, linearity, and distortion are often most important specs. Audio-frequency VCOs for use in musical contexts were largely superseded in the 1980s by their digital counterparts, [[Digitally controlled oscillator|DCOs]], due to their output stability in the face of temperature changes during operation. From the 1990s on, pure software is the primary sound-generating method, but VCOs have become popular again often thanks to their imperfections.\n\n==Voltage-controlled crystal oscillator as a clock generator==\nA clock generator is an oscillator that provides a timing signal to synchronize operations in digital circuits. VCXO clock generators are used in many areas such as digital TV, modems, transmitters and computers. Design parameters for a VCXO clock generator are tuning voltage range, center frequency, frequency tuning range and the timing jitter of the output signal. Jitter is a form of [[phase noise]] that must be minimised in applications such as radio receivers, transmitters and measuring equipment.\n\nThe tuning range of a VCXO is typically a few parts per million over a control voltage range of typically 0 to 3 volts. When a wider selection of clock frequencies is needed the VCXO output can be passed through digital divider circuits to obtain lower frequency(ies) or be fed to a [[phase-locked loop]] (PLL). ICs containing both a VCXO (for external crystal) and a PLL are available. A typical application is to provide clock frequencies in a range from 12&nbsp;kHz to 96&nbsp;kHz to an audio [[digital-to-analog converter]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Low-frequency oscillation]] (LFO)\n* [[Modular synthesizer]]\n* [[Numerically controlled oscillator]] (NCO)\n* [[Variable-frequency oscillator]] (VFO)\n* [[Variable-gain amplifier]] \n* [[Voltage-controlled filter]] (VCF)\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n{{Reflist|group=Anand Sons}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://my.integritynet.com.au/purdic/voltage-controlled-oscillators.htm schematics]\n*[http://www.cel.com/pdf/appnotes/an1034.pdf Designing VCOs and Buffers Using the UPA family of Dual Transistors]\n\n{{Electronic oscillators}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Voltage-Controlled Oscillator}}\n[[Category:Oscillators]]\n[[Category:Synthesizer electronics]]\n[[Category:Radio electronics]]\n[[Category:Electronic design]]"}]}}}}
