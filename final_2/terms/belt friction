When one end of the belt is being pulled only part of this force is transmitted to the other end wrapped about a surface. The friction force increases with the amount of wrap about a surface and makes it so the [[tension (physics)|tension]] in the belt can be different at both ends of the belt. Belt friction can be modeled by the [[Capstan equation|Belt friction equation]].<ref name=Attaway>{{cite conference | last = Attaway | first = Stephen W. | title = The Mechanics of Friction in Rope Rescue | url = http://www.jrre.org/att_frict.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = February 1, 2010 | conference = International Technical Rescue Symposium | year = 1999}}</ref>\n\nIn practice, the theoretical tension acting on the belt or rope calculated by the belt friction equation can be compared to the maximum tension the belt can support. This helps a designer of such a rig to know how many times the belt or rope must be wrapped around the pulley to prevent it from slipping. Mountain climbers and sailing crews demonstrate a standard knowledge of belt friction when accomplishing basic tasks.\n\n== Equation ==\n{{main article|Capstan equation}}\nThe equation used to model belt friction is, assuming the belt has no [[mass]] and its material is a fixed composition:<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Mann\n| first = Herman\n| title = Belt Friction\n| date = May 5, 2005\n| url = http://www.esr.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/rt1/currentcourse/node57.html\n| publisher = Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t \n| accessdate = 2010-02-01}}</ref>\n\n: <math>T_2=T_1e^{\\mu_s\\beta} \\, </math>\n\nwhere <math>T_2</math> is the tension of the pulling side, <math>T_1</math> is the tension of the resisting side, <math>\\mu_s</math> is the [[static friction]] coefficient, which has no units, and <math>\\beta</math> is the angle, in [[radian]]s, formed by the first and last spots the belt touches the pulley, with the vertex at the center of the pulley.<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Chandoo\n| title = Couloumb Belt Friction\n| url = http://web.mst.edu/~bestmech/preview/chandoo/8_2_2_1/8_2_2_1.htm\n| publisher = Missouri University of Science and Technology\n| accessdate = 2010-02-01}}</ref>\n\nThe tension on the pulling side of the belt and pulley has the ability to increase [[exponential growth|exponentially]]<ref name=Attaway/> if the magnitude of the belt angle increases (e.g. it is wrapped around the pulley segment numerous times).\n\n== Generalization for a rope lying on an arbitrary orthotropic surface ==\nIf a rope is laying in equilibrium under tangential forces on a rough orthotropic surface then three following conditions (all of them) are satisfied:\n\n1.

This also applies to extremely dry or warm conditions which will evaporate any water naturally found in the belt, nominally making friction greater.\n* Overall design of the setup \u2013 The setup involves the initial conditions of the construction, such as the angle which the belt is wrapped around and geometry of the belt and pulley system.\n\n== Applications ==\n\nAn understanding of belt friction is essential for sailing crews and mountain climbers.<ref name=Attaway/> Their professions require being able to understand the amount of weight a rope with a certain tension capacity can hold versus the amount of wraps around a pulley. Too many revolutions around a pulley make it inefficient to retract or release rope, and too few may cause the rope to slip. Misjudging the ability of a rope and capstan system to maintain the proper frictional forces may lead to failure and injury.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Capstan equation]]\n*[[Frictional contact mechanics]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Mechanics]]"}]}}}}
