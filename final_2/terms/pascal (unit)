It is defined as one [[Newton (unit)|newton]] per [[square metre]].<ref>{{SIbrochure8th|page=118}}</ref> It is named after the French [[polymath]] [[Blaise Pascal]].\n\nCommon multiple units of the pascal are the hectopascal (1&nbsp;hPa = 100&nbsp;Pa) which is equal to one [[Bar (unit)#Usage|millibar]], the kilopascal (1&nbsp;kPa = 1000&nbsp;Pa), the megapascal (1&nbsp;MPa = 1,000,000&nbsp;Pa), and the gigapascal (1&nbsp;GPa = 1,000,000,000&nbsp;Pa).\n\nThe unit of measurement called [[Atmosphere (unit)|standard atmosphere (atm)]] is defined as 101.325&nbsp;kPa and approximates to the average pressure at sea-level at the latitude 45\u00b0&nbsp;N.<ref name=BIPM>{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ViewCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM=10&RES=4 |publisher=[[BIPM]] |title=Definition of the standard atmosphere|accessdate=2015-02-16}}</ref>  [[Meteorology|Meteorological]] [[barometric pressure|reports]] typically state [[atmospheric pressure]] in hectopascals.<ref>[http://www.ofcm.gov/fmh-1/fmh1.htm U.S. Federal Meteorological Handbook]</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe unit is named after [[Blaise Pascal]], noted for his contributions to hydrodynamics and hydrostatics, and experiments with a [[barometer]]. The name pascal was adopted for the SI unit newton per square metre (N/m<sup>2</sup>) by the 14th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] in 1971.<ref>[http://www.bipm.fr/en/convention/cgpm/14/pascal-siemens.html bipm.fr]</ref>\n\n== Definition ==\nThe pascal can be expressed using [[SI derived unit]]s, or alternatively solely [[SI base unit]]s, as:\n:<math>{\\rm 1~Pa = 1~\\frac{N}{m^2} = 1~\\frac{kg}{m \\cdot s^2}}</math>\nwhere '''N''' is the [[Newton (unit)|newton]], '''m''' is the [[metre]], '''kg''' is the [[kilogram]], and '''s''' is the [[second]].<ref>[http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-2/table3.html Table 3 (Section 2.2.2)], ''SI Brochure'', [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]</ref>\n\nOne pascal is the pressure exerted by a force of magnitude one newton perpendicularly upon an area of one square metre.\n\n== Miscellaneous ==\nThe unit of measurement called [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere or standard atmosphere (atm)]] is {{convert|101325|Pa|kPa|abbr=on|comma=gaps}}.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ViewCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM=10&RES=4\n|title = Resolution 4 of the 10th meeting of the CGPM\n|publisher=[[CGPM|Conf\u00e9rence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM)]]\n|year = 1954\n|accessdate = 2010-04-05}}</ref> This value is often used as a reference pressure and specified as such in some national and international standards, such as ISO&nbsp;2787 (pneumatic tools and compressors), ISO&nbsp;2533 (aerospace) and ISO&nbsp;5024 (petroleum). In contrast, [[IUPAC]] recommends the use of 100 kPa as a standard pressure when reporting the properties of substances.<ref>IUPAC.org, Gold Book, [http://goldbook.iupac.org/S05921.html ''Standard Pressure'']</ref>\n\nThe [[Unicode]] computer character set has dedicated symbols {{Unichar|33a9|Square Pa}} and {{Unichar|33AA|Square kPa}} in the [[CJK Compatibility]] block, but these exist for backward-compatibility with some older ideographic character-sets and are therefore [[deprecate]]d.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U3300.pdf|title=CJK Compatibility|accessdate=2016-02-21|date=2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Unicode Consortium|title=The Unicode Standard, Version 8.0.0|location=Mountain View, CA|date=2015|isbn=978-1-936213-10-8|url=http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0|accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\n{{refimprove|section|date=January 2016}}\nThe pascal (Pa) or kilopascal (kPa) as a unit of pressure measurement is widely used throughout the world and has largely replaced the [[pounds per square inch]] (psi) unit, except in some countries that still use the [[Imperial measurement system]], including the United States.\n\n[[Geophysics|Geophysicists]] use the gigapascal (GPa) in measuring or calculating tectonic stresses and pressures within the [[Earth]].\n\nMedical [[elastography]] measures tissue stiffness non-invasively with [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]], and often displays the [[Young's modulus]] or [[shear modulus]] of tissue in kilopascals.\n\nIn [[materials science]] and [[engineering]], the pascal measures the [[Young's modulus|stiffness]], [[tensile strength]] and [[compressive strength]] of materials. In engineering use, because the pascal represents a very small quantity, the megapascal (MPa) is the preferred unit for these uses.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ approximate Young's modulus for common substances <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/young-modulus-d_417.html|title=Tensile Modulus - Modulus of Elasticity or Young's Modulus - for some common Materials|accessdate=2015-02-16}}</ref> \n!

This applies not only to the thermodynamics of pressurised gases, but also to the energy density of [[electric potential energy|electric]], [[magnetic field#Energy stored in magnetic fields|magnetic]], and [[gravitational energy|gravitational]] fields.\n\nIn measurements of [[sound pressure]], or loudness of sound, one pascal is equal to 94 decibels [[Sound pressure#Sound pressure level|SPL]].  The quietest sound a human can hear, known as the [[threshold of hearing]], is 0&nbsp;dB&nbsp;[[Sound pressure#Sound pressure level|SPL]], or 20&nbsp;\u00b5Pa.\n\n[[Blower door|The airtightness of buildings]] is measured at 50&nbsp;Pa.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.resnet.us/hotnews/revised_chapter_seven_final_9-16-10.pdf\n|title = Chapter 7 ResNet Standards: ResNet National Standard for Home Energy Audits\n|publisher=[[ResNet]]\n|year = 2010\n|accessdate = 2011-03-03}}</ref>\n\n===Hectopascal and millibar units===\n{{main|Bar (unit)}}\nThe units of atmospheric pressure commonly used in [[meteorology]] were formerly the [[Bar (unit)|bar]], which was close to the average air pressure on Earth, and the [[millibar]]. Since the introduction of [[SI units]], meteorologists generally measure pressures in hectopascals (hPa) unit, equal to 100 pascals or 1 millibar.<ref>[http://www.knmi.nl/actueel/ KNMI]</ref><ref>[http://www.meteo.be/meteo/view/fr/68771-FAQ+sur+le+temps.html?view=195695 RMI]</ref><ref>[http://www.dwd.de/de/WundK/W_aktuell/Beobachtungen.htm DWD]</ref><ref>[http://www.jma.go.jp/en/g3/index.html JMA]</ref><ref>[http://www.meteoam.it/modules.php?name=analisiPrevisioniSuolo MDD]</ref><ref>[http://weather.noaa.gov/weather/current/KDCA.html NOAA]</ref><ref>[http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/guide/weather/symbols#units UK Met Office]</ref> Exceptions include Canada and Portugal, which use kilopascals (kPa). In many other fields of science, the SI is preferred, which means Pa with a prefix (in multiples of 1000) is preferred.<ref>[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/HTMLTemplate/!ctvDynNews/Weather/Weather?City=Montreal CTV News, weather; current conditions in Montreal]</ref><ref>[http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/city/pages/qc-147_metric_e.html Environment Canada weather, current conditions in Montreal]</ref>\n\nMany countries also use the millibar or hectopascal to give aviation [[altimeter setting]]s. In practically all other fields, the [[kilopascal]] (1000 pascals) is used instead.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Centimetre of water]]\n* [[Metric prefix]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude (pressure)]]\n* [[Pascal's law]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{SI units}}\n\n[[Category:SI derived units]]\n[[Category:Units of pressure]]\n[[Category:Blaise Pascal]]"}]}}}}
