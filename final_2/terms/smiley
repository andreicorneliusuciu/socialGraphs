The classic form designed in 1963 comprises a yellow circle with two black dots representing eyes and a black arc representing the mouth ('''<code>\u263a</code>'''). On the Internet and in other [[plain text]] communication channels, the [[emoticon]] form (sometimes also called the '''smiley-face emoticon''') has traditionally been most popular, typically employing a [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] and a right [[parenthesis]] to form sequences like '''<code>:^)</code>''', '''<code>:)</code>''', or '''<code>(:</code>''' that resemble a smiling face when viewed after rotation through 90 degrees. \"Smiley\" is also sometimes used as a generic term for any emoticon. The smiley has been referenced in nearly all areas of Western culture including music, movies, and art. The smiley is also an unofficial logo for [[rave]] culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/feb/21/smiley-face-design-history |title=Smiley Face Design History |author= Jon Savage |date=February 21, 2009 |accessdate= October 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe plural form \"smilies\" is commonly used,<ref>[[Google Ngram Viewer]]: [https://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=smileys%2Csmilies&year_start=1900&year_end=2008 smilies vs smileys]</ref> but the variant spelling \"[[wiktionary:smilie|smilie]]\" is not as common as the \"y\" spelling.<ref>[[Google Ngram Viewer]]: [https://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=smiley%2Csmilie&year_start=1900&year_end=2011 smilie vs smiley]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe poet and author [[Johannes V. Jensen]] was amongst other things famous for experimenting with the form of his writing. In a letter sent to publisher Ernst Bojesen in December 1900 he includes both a happy face and a sad face, resembling the modern smiley.\n\nA commercial version of a smiley face with the word \"THANKS\" above it was available in 1919 and applied as a sticker on receipts issued by the Buffalo Steam Roller Company in Buffalo New York. The round face was much more detailed than the one depicted above, having eyebrows, nose, teeth, chin, facial creases and shading, and is reminiscent of \"man-in-the-moon\" style characterizations.\n\n[[File:NYHT Smiley 10th March 1953.jpg|thumb|upright|A poster for ''[[Lili]]'' in 1953]]\n[[Ingmar Bergman]]'s 1948 film ''[[Port of Call (1948 film)|Port of Call]]'' includes a scene where the unhappy Berit draws a ''sad'' face {{ndash}} closely resembling the modern \"frowny\", but including a dot for the nose {{ndash}} in lipstick on her mirror, before being interrupted.<ref>''Ingmarbergman.se''.

Listeners who answered their phone \"WMCA Good Guys!\" were rewarded with a \"WMCA good guys\" sweatshirt that incorporated a happy face into its design. Thousands of these sweatshirts were given away.<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9059885/Smileys-People-Radio-4-The-million-dollar-smile.html |title= Smiley's People (Radio 4): The million dollar smile |author= Alastair Sooke |date= February 3, 2012 |work= The Telegraph |quote= [Loufrani] points out that a smiley face was a key feature of a well-known promotional campaign for a radio network on America\u2019s East Coast in the late Fifties.}}</ref><ref name=nyt2001 /><ref name=lennox /> The WMCA smiley was yellow with black dots as eyes, but it had a slightly crooked smile instead of a full smile, and no creases in the mouth.<ref name=lennox>{{citation |title= Now You Know More: The Book of Answers |series= Now You Know |volume= 2 |author= Doug Lennox, illustrated by Catriona Wight |edition= illustrated |publisher= Dundurn |year= 2004 |isbn= 9781550025309 |page= 50 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=P4gCzZsOY0UC&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=smiley+wmca&source=bl&ots=bQzVepXuqN&sig=BOcZ7SGOWHMENa5Yyuirjn6S_mg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rbgaUJGHLNO00QWl_oGgDQ&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=smiley%20wmca&f=false }}</ref>\n\nAs per [[Smithsonian]], the smiley face as we know it today was created by [[Harvey Ross Ball]], an [[American people|American]] [[graphic artist]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stamp|first1=Jimmy|title=Who really invented the Smiley face|date=13 March 2013|publisher=Smithsonian|location=Washington DC|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/who-really-invented-the-smiley-face-2058483/?no-ist|accessdate=29 May 2015}}</ref> In 1963, [[Harvey Ball]] was employed by State Mutual Life Assurance Company of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] (now known as [[Hanover Insurance]]) to create a happy face to raise the morale of the employees. Ball created the design in ten minutes and was paid $45 (equivalent to $330 USD in 2012 currency). His rendition, with bright yellow background, dark oval eyes, full smile and creases at the sides of the mouth,<ref name=lennox/> was imprinted on more than fifty million buttons and was familiar around the world. The design is so simple that it is certain that similar versions were produced before 1963, including those cited above. However, Ball\u2019s rendition, as described here, has become the most iconic version.<ref name=nyt2001>{{cite news |first=William H. |last=Honan |title=H. R.

Tenagi's design was used in an advertising campaign for Seattle-based University Federal Savings & Loan. The ad campaign was inspired by Charles Strouse' lyrics in ''Put on a Happy Face'' from the musical ''Bye Bye Birdie''. Stern, the man behind this campaign, incorporated the Happy Face in his run for Seattle Mayor in 1993.<ref name=\"Adams\"/>\n\nThe graphic was further popularized in the early 1970s by Philadelphia brothers Bernard and Murray Spain, who seized upon it in September 1970 in a campaign to sell novelty items. The two produced buttons as well as coffee mugs, [[t-shirts]], [[bumper stickers]] and many other items emblazoned with the symbol and the phrase \"Have a happy day\" (devised by Gyula Bogar),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lameadventures.com/tag/web/|title=web - Lame Adventures|work=lameadventures.com}}</ref> which mutated into \"[[Have a nice day]]\". Working with New York button manufacturer NG Slater, some 50 million happy face badges were produced by 1972.<ref name=\"Peter Shapiro 2001, pp44-49\">Peter Shapiro, Smiling Faces Sometimes, in The Wire, issue 203, January 2001, pp44-49.</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Frenchman [[Franklin loufrani|Franklin Loufrani]] became the first person to legally trademark the smiley face. He used it to highlight the good news parts of the newspaper ''[[France Soir]]''. He simply called the design \"Smiley\" and launched the Smiley Company. In 1996 Loufrani's son Nicolas took over the family business and transformed it into a huge multinational corporation. Nicolas Loufrani was outwardly skeptical of Harvey Ball's claim to creating the first smiley face. After all, the design that his father came up with and Ball's design were nearly identical. Loufrani argued that the design is so simple that no one person can lay claim to having created it. As evidence for this, Loufrani's website points to early cave paintings found in France (2500 BC) that he claims are the first depictions of a smiley face. Loufrani also points to a 1960 radio ad campaign that reportedly made use of a similar design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/who-really-invented-the-smiley-face-2058483/?no-ist|title=Who Really Invented the Smiley Face?|author=Jimmy Stamp|work=Smithsonian}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:BTBbeatdis.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Beat Dis'' by Bomb the Bass (1988) features the \"bloodied\" version of the popular smiley icon.]]\nIn the UK, the happy face has been associated with [[psychedelic culture]] since [[Ubi Dwyer]] and the [[Windsor Free Festival]] in the 1970s and the [[electronic dance music]] culture, particularly with [[acid house]], that emerged during the [[Second Summer of Love]] in the late 1980s. The association was cemented when the band [[Bomb the Bass]] used an extracted smiley from ''[[Watchmen]]'' on the centre of its ''[[Beat Dis]]'' hit single.\n\n== In text ==\n\nOne of the first uses of the smiley in text may have been in [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]]'s poem ''To Fortune'' (1648),<ref>{{cite news|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis C.|title=The First Emoticon May Have Appeared in ... 1648|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/04/the-first-emoticon-may-have-appeared-in-1648/360622/|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=[[The Atlantic]]|date=14 April 2014}}</ref> which contains the line \"Upon my ruines (smiling yet :)\". Journalist [[Levi Stahl]] has suggested that this may have been an intentional \"orthographic joke\", but this interpretation of the punctuation is disputed, and there are citations of similar punctuation in a non-humorous context, even within Herrick's own work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/04/15/emoticon_robert_herrick_s_17th_century_poem_to_fortune_does_not_contain.html|title=Emoticon: Robert Herrick's 17th century poem \"To Fortune\" does not contain a smiley face.|work=Slate Magazine}}</ref> It is likely that the parenthesis was added later by modern editors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://text-patterns.thenewatlantis.com/2014/04/smileys-emoticons-typewriter-art.html|title=smileys, emoticons, typewriter art|work=Text Patterns - The New Atlantis}}</ref>\n\nOn the [[Internet]], the smiley has become a visual means of conveyance that uses images. The first known mention on the Internet was on September 19, 1982, when [[Scott Fahlman]] from [[Carnegie Mellon University]] wrote:\n\n{{cquote|I propose that [sic] the following character sequence for joke markers: :-) .

This brought Loufrani into conflict with [[Wal-Mart]], which had begun prominently featuring a happy face in its \"Rolling Back Prices\" campaign over a year earlier.

Despite that, Wal-Mart sued an online parodist for alleged \"trademark infringement\" after he used the symbol (as well as various [[portmanteau]]s of \"Wal-\", such as \"Walocaust\"). The District Court found in favor of the parodist when in March 2008, the judge concluded that [Wal-Mart's] smiley face [logo] was not shown to be \"inherently distinctive\" and that it \"has failed to establish that the smiley face has acquired secondary meaning or that it is otherwise a protectible trademark\" under U.S. law.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.citizen.org/litigation/forms/cases/getlinkforcase.cfm?cID=206| date=28 March 2008| title=Smith v.
