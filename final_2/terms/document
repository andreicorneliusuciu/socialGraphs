Originating from the Latin ''Documentum'' meaning lesson -  the verb doce\u014d means to teach, and is pronounced similarly, in the past it was usually used as a term for a written proof used as evidence. In the [[computer age]], a document is usually used to describe a primarily textual [[Computer file|file]], along with its structure and design, such as fonts, colors and additional [[Computer-generated imagery|images]].\n\nThe modern term 'document' can no longer be defined by it [[transmission medium]] (such as paper), following the existence of [[electronic document]]s. 'Documentation' has more meanings than a written or drawn presentation of thoughts.\n\nThe formal term 'document' is defined in [[Library and information science]] and in [[documentation science]], as a basic theoretical construct. It is everything which may be preserved or represented in order to serve as evidence for some purpose. The classical example provided by [[Suzanne Briet]] is an [[antelope]]: \"An antelope running wild on the plains of Africa should not be considered a document, she rules. But if it were to be captured, taken to a zoo and made an object of study, it has been made into a document. It has become physical evidence being used by those who study it. Indeed, scholarly articles written about the antelope are secondary documents, since the antelope itself is the primary document.\" (Quoted from Buckland, 1998 <ref>Buckland, M. (1998). What is a digital document? In: Document Num\u00e9rique (Paris) 2(2),  http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/digdoc.html</ref>). (This view has been seen as an early expression of what now is known as [[actor\u2013network theory]]).\n\n== The document concept ==\nThe concept of \"document\" has been defined{{by whom?|date=July 2015}} as '''\u201cany concrete or symbolic indication, preserved or recorded, for reconstructing or for proving a phenomenon, whether physical or mental\"''' (Briet, 1951, 7; here quoted from Buckland, 1991).\n\nA much-cited article asked \"what is a document[?]\" and concluded this way: \u201cThe evolving notion of \u2018\u2018document\u2019\u2019 among (Jonathan Priest). [[Paul Otlet|Otlet]], [[Suzanne Briet|Briet]], [[Walter Sch\u00fcrmeyer|Sch\u00fcrmeyer]], and the other [[documentalist]]s increasingly emphasized whatever functioned as a document rather than traditional physical forms of documents. The shift to digital technology would seem to make this distinction even more important. [[David M Levy|Levy]]\u2019s thoughtful analyses have shown that an emphasis on the technology of digital documents has impeded our understanding of digital documents as documents (e.g., Levy, 1994<ref>Levy, D. M. (1994) . Fixed or fluid? Document stability and new media. In European Conference on Hypertext Technology 1994 Proceedings, (pp. 24\u201331) . New York: Association for Computing Machinery. Retrieved 2011-10-18 from: \nhttp://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.119.8813&rep=rep1&type=pdf</ref>). A conventional document, such as a mail message or a technical report, exists physically in digital technology as a string of bits, as does everything else in a digital environment. As an object of study, it has been made{{by whom?|date=July 2015}} into a document. It has become physical evidence by those who study it.\n\n== Types of documents ==\nDocuments are sometimes classified as [[Classified information|secret]], [[Privacy|private]] or public.  They may also be described as a [[Draft document|draft]] or [[Proofreading|proof]]. When a document is [[Copying|copied]], the source is referred to as the [[Originality|original]].\n\nThere are accepted standards for specific applications in various fields, such as:\n* Academic: [[thesis]], [[Academic publishing|paper]], [[journal]].\n* Business and accounting: [[Invoice]], [[Financial quote|quote]], [[RFP]], [[Proposal (business)|Proposal]], [[Contract]], [[Packing slip]], [[Ship's manifest|Manifest]], [[Report]] detailed & summary, [[Spread sheet]], [[MSDS]], [[Waybill]], [[Bill of Lading]] (BOL), [[Financial statement]], [[Nondisclosure agreement]] (NDA) or sometimes referred to as; Mutual nondisclosure agreement (MNDA).\n* Law and politics: [[summons]], [[certificate (disambiguation)#Official document|certificate]], [[license]], [[gazette]].\n* Government and industry: [[white paper]], application forms, user-guide.\n* Media and marketing: [[News in brief|brief]], [[mock-up]], [[screenplay|script]].\n\nSuch standard documents can be created based on a [[Template (word processing)|template]].\n\n== Developing documents ==\nThe [[page layout]] of a document is the manner in which information is graphically arranged in the document space (e.g., on a page). If the appearance of the document is of concern, page layout is generally the responsibility of a [[graphic design]]er. [[Typography]] deals with the design of letter and symbol forms, as well as their physical arrangement in the document (see [[typesetting]]). [[Information design]] focuses on the effective communication of [[information]], especially in industrial documents and public [[sign]]s. Simple text documents may not require a visual design and may be handled by an [[author]], [[Data entry clerk|clerk]] or [[transcriber]].  [[Form (document)|Forms]] may require a visual design for the initial fields, but not to fill out the forms.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:LL Zamenhof birth certificate.jpg|thumb|A birth certificate from 1859.]]\nTraditionally, the medium of a document was [[paper]] and the information was applied to it as [[ink]], either by hand (to make a hand-written document) or by a mechanical process (such as a [[printing press]] or, more recently, a [[laser printer]]).\n\nThrough time, documents have also been written with ink on [[papyrus]] (starting in ancient [[Egypt]]) or [[parchment]]; scratched as [[runes]] or carved on stone using a sharp apparatus (such as the [[Tablets of Stone]] described in [[the bible]]); stamped or cut into [[clay]] and then baked to make [[clay tablet]]s (e.g., in the [[Sumer]]ian and other [[Mesopotamia]]n civilisations). The paper, papyrus or parchment might be rolled up as a [[scroll (parchment)|scroll]] or cut into sheets and [[Bookbinding|bound]] into a [[book]]. Today short documents might also consist of sheets of paper [[Staple (fastener)|stapled]] together.\n\nModern electronic means of storing and displaying documents include:\n* [[Desktop computer]] and [[computer display|monitor]] (or [[laptop]], [[tablet computer|tablet PC]], etc.); optionally with a [[computer printer|printer]] to obtain a [[hard copy]].\n* [[Personal digital assistant]] (PDA).\n* Dedicated [[e-book device]].\n* [[Electronic paper]], typically, using the Portable Document Format [[PDF]].\n* [[Information appliance]]s.\n* [[Digital audio player]]s.\n* [[Radio]] and [[television]] [[Telecommunications Service Provider|service provider]].\n\nDigital documents usually have to adhere to a specific [[file format]] in order to be useful.\n\nThat documents cannot be defined by their transmission medium\n\n== In law ==\nDocuments in all forms are frequently found to be material [[evidence]] in criminal and civil proceedings. The [[forensic]] analysis of such a document falls under the scope of [[questioned document examination]]. For the purpose of cataloging and managing the large number of documents that may be produced in the course of a lawsuit, [[Bates numbering]] is often applied to all documents so that each document has a unique, aribitrary identifying number.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Realia (library science)]].\n* [[Subject (documents)]].\n* [[Commission (document)]].\n* [[Form (document)]].\n* [[Constitutional documents]].\n* [[Identity document]].\n* [[Identity document forgery]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|Documents}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Briet, S.
