It is often used as a form of [[exhaust heat management]].\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Automotive===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}\nDue to the large amounts of heat given off by internal combustion engines, heat shields are used on most engines to protect components and bodywork from heat damage. As well as protection, effective heat shields can give a performance benefit by reducing the under-bonnet temperatures, therefore reducing the intake temperature. Heat shields vary widely in price, but most are easy to fit, usually by stainless steel clips or high temperature tape. There are two main types of automotive heat shield:\n* The rigid heat shield has, until recently, been made from solid steel, but is now often made from aluminum. Some high-end rigid heat shields are made out of aluminum sheet or other composites, with a ceramic thermal barrier coating to improve the heat insulation.\n* The flexible heat shield is normally made from thin aluminum sheeting, sold either flat or in a roll, and is bent by hand, by the fitter. High performance flexible heat shields sometimes include extras, such as ceramic insulation applied via [[plasma spraying]]. These latest products are commonplace in top-end motorsports such as [[Formula 1]].\n* Textile heat shields used for various components such as the exhaust, turbo, DPF, or other exhaust component.\nAs a result, a heat shield is often fitted by both amateur and professional personnel during a phase of [[engine tuning]].\n\nHeat shields are also used to cool engine mount vents. When a vehicle is at higher speed there is enough ram air to cool the under hood engine compartment, but when the vehicle is moving at lower speeds or climbing a gradient there is a need of insulating the engine heat to get transferred to other parts around it, e.g. Engine Mounts. With the help of proper thermal analysis and use of heat shields, the engine mount vents can be optimised for the best performances.<ref>http://www.fkfs.de/uploads/publikationen/fkfs_kfz_AD_Binner.pdf</ref>\n\n===Space===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}\n[[File:Apollo 12 heat shield.JPG||thumb|[[Apollo 12]] capsule's ablative heat shield (after use) on display at the [[Virginia Air and Space Center]]]]\n[[Image:Discovery's heat shield.jpg|thumb|Thermal soak aerodynamic heat shield used on the Space Shuttle.]]\nSpacecraft that land on a [[planet]] with an [[atmosphere]], such as [[Earth]], [[Mars]], and [[Venus]], currently do so by entering the atmosphere at high speeds, depending on [[air resistance]] rather than rocket power to slow them down.  A side effect of this method of atmospheric re-entry is [[aerodynamic heating]], which can be highly destructive to the structure of an unprotected or faulty spacecraft.<ref>http://www.phys.ttu.edu/~cmyles/Phys4304/Papers/Dynamics-of-Atmospheric-Rentry.doc</ref>   An aerodynamic heat shield consists of a protective layer of special materials to dissipate the heat.  Two basic types of aerodynamic heat shield have been used:\n*An [[ablative heat shield]] consists of a layer of plastic resin, the outer surface of which is heated to a gas, which then carries the heat away by [[convection]].  Such shields were used on the [[Project Mercury#Spacecraft|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini#Spacecraft|Gemini]], and [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo]] spacecraft.\n*A [[Atmospheric entry#Thermal soak|thermal soak heat shield]] uses an insulating material to absorb and radiate the heat away from the spacecraft structure.  This type was used on the [[Space Shuttle]], consisting of [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system#Materials|ceramic or composite tiles]] over most of the vehicle surface, with [[reinforced carbon-carbon]] material on the highest heat load points (the nose and wing leading edges).  Damage to this material on a wing caused the 2003 [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]].\n\nSome spacecraft also use a heat shield (in the conventional automotive sense) to protect fuel tanks and equipment from the heat produced by a large [[rocket engine]].  Such shields were used on the Apollo [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Module (SM)|Service Module]] and [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] descent stage.\n\n===Industry===\nHeat shields are often affixed to [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] or [[Automatic firearm|automatic]] rifles and shotguns as [[barrel shroud]]s in order to protect the user's hands from the heat caused by firing shots in rapid succession. They have also often been affixed to pump-action combat shotguns, allowing the soldier to grasp the barrel while using a bayonet.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aeroshell]]\n*[[Atmospheric reentry]]\n*[[AVCOAT]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Heat Shield}}\n[[Category:Spacecraft components]]\n[[Category:Auto parts]]"}]}}}}
