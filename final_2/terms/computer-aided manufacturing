CAM is used in many schools alongside computer-aided design (CAD) to create objects.\n\n==Overview==\n{{see also|Printed circuit board#PCB CAM}}\n[[File:Disc with dental implants made with WorkNC.jpg|thumb|Chrome-cobalt disc with crowns for [[dental implant]]s, manufactured using [[WorkNC]] CAM]]\nTraditionally, CAM has been considered as a [[numerical control]] (NC) programming tool, where in two-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional (3-D) models of components generated in [[Computer aided design|CAD]]As with other \u201cComputer-Aided\u201d technologies, CAM does not eliminate the need for skilled professionals such as [[manufacturing engineer]]s, NC programmers, or [[machinist]]s.  CAM, in fact, leverages both the value of the most skilled manufacturing professionals through advanced productivity tools, while building the skills of new professionals through visualization, simulation and optimization tools.\n\n==History==\nEarly commercial applications of CAM was in large companies in the automotive and aerospace industries, for example [[Pierre B\u00e9zier]]s work developing the CAD/CAM application [[UNISURF]] in the 1960s for car body design and tooling at [[Renault]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Dokken|first=Tor|title=The History of CAD|url=http://www.saga-network.eu/index.php/resources/downloads/category/2-kolimpari?download=42%3Ator-dokken-the-history-of-cad-and-examples-of-its-use-in-industry|publisher=The SAGA-project|accessdate=17 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, CAM software was seen to have several shortcomings that necessitated an overly high level of involvement by skilled CNC machinists. Fallows created the first CAD software but this had severe shortcomings and was promptly taken back into the developing stage.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} CAM software would output code for the least capable machine, as each machine tool control added on to the standard G-code set for increased flexibility.  In some cases, such as improperly set up CAM software or specific tools, the CNC machine required manual editing before the program will run properly.  None of these issues were so insurmountable that a thoughtful engineer or skilled machine operator could not overcome for prototyping or small production runs; G-Code is a simple language.  In high production or high precision shops, a different set of problems were encountered where an experienced CNC machinist must both hand-code programs and run CAM software.\n\nIntegration of CAD with other components of CAD/CAM/CAE [[Product lifecycle management]] (PLM) environment requires an effective [[CAD data exchange]]. Usually it had been necessary to force the CAD operator to export the data in one of the common data formats, such as [[IGES]] or [[STL (file format)|STL]] or [[Parasolid]] formats that are supported by a wide variety of software.\nThe output from the CAM software is usually a simple text file of G-code/M-codes, sometimes many thousands of commands long, that is then transferred to a machine tool using a [[direct numerical control]] (DNC) program or in modern Controllers using a common [[USB]] Storage Device.\n\nCAM packages could not, and still cannot, reason as a machinist can. They could not optimize toolpaths to the extent required of mass production. Users would select the type of tool, machining process and paths to be used. While an engineer may have a working knowledge of G-code programming, small optimization and wear issues compound over time.  Mass-produced items that require machining are often initially created through casting or some other non-machine method.  This enables hand-written, short, and highly optimized G-code that could not be produced in a CAM package.\n\nAt least in the United States, there is a shortage of young, skilled machinists entering the workforce able to perform at the extremes of manufacturing; high precision and mass production.<ref>Joshua Wright.

This is occurring primarily in three arenas:\n# Ease of usage\n# Manufacturing complexity\n# Integration with PLM and the extended enterprise\n\n;Ease in use\n\n:For the user who is just getting started as a CAM user, out-of-the-box capabilities providing Process Wizards, templates, libraries, machine tool kits, automated feature based machining and job function specific tailorable user interfaces build user confidence and speed the learning curve.\n:User confidence is further built on 3D visualization through a closer integration with the 3D CAD environment, including error-avoiding simulations and optimizations.\n\n;Manufacturing complexity\n:The manufacturing environment is increasingly complex. The need for CAM and PLM tools by buMs are  NC programmer or machinist is similar to the need for computer assistance by the pilot of modern aircraft systems. The modern machinery cannot be properly used without this assistance.\n:Today's CAM systems support the full range of machine tools including: [[turning]], 5 axis machining and [[Wire cutting|wire EDM]]. Today\u2019s CAM user can easily generate streamlined tool paths, optimized tool axis tilt for higher feed rates, better tool life and surface finish and optimized Z axis depth cuts as well as driving non-cutting operations such as the specification of probing motions.\n\n;Integration with PLM and the extended enterpriseLM to integrate manufacturing with enterprise operations from concept through field support of the finished product.\n:To ensure ease of use appropriate to user objectives, modern CAM solutions are scalable from a stand-alone CAM system to a fully integrated multi-CAD 3D solution-set.  These solutions are created to meet the full needs of manufacturing personnel including part planning, shop documentation, resource management and data management and exchange. To prevent these solutions from detailed tool specific information a dedicated [[tool management]]\n\n== Machining process ==\nMost machining progresses through many stages,<ref>[http://www.cnccookbook.com/CCCAMToolpaths.htm CAM Toolpath Strategies].

In milling, the result often gives the appearance of [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraces]], because the strategy has taken advantage of the ability to cut the model horizontally.  Common strategies are zig-zag clearing, offset clearing, plunge roughing, rest-roughing.\n\n;Semi-f\n\n: This process begins with a roughed part that unevenly approximates the model and cuts  to within a fixed offset distance from the model.  The semi-finishing pass must leave a small amount of material so the tool can cut accurately while finishing, but not so little that the tool and material deflect instead of sending.  Common strategies are [[raster passes]], waterline passes, constant step-over passes, [[pencil milling]].\n\n;Finishing\n: Finishing involves a slow pass across the material in very fine steps to produce the finished part.  In finishing, the step between one pass and another is minimal.  Feed rates are low and spindle speeds are raised to produce an accurate surface.\n\n;Contour milling\n: In milling applications on hardware with five or more axes, a separate finishing process called contouring can be performed.  Instead of stepping down in fine-grained increments to approximate a surface, the work piece is rotated to make the cutting surfaces of the tool tangent to the ideal part features.  This produces an excellent surface finish with high dimensional accuracy.\n\n==Software: large vendors==\n{{See also|List of CAM companies|:Category:Computer-aided manufacturing software}}\n{{For|3D CAM software for personal 3D printers|3D_printing#Printing}}\n\nThe top 20 largest CAM software companies, by direct revenues in year 2015, are sorted by global revenues:\n\n* [http://www.3ds.com/ Dassault Syst\u00e8mes: CATIA] <ref>http://www.3ds.com/investors/earnings/earnings-details/fiscal-year-2015-quarter-4-and-full-year-2015/</ref>\n* [https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/ Siemens AG: NX CAM] <ref>http://www.engineering.com/PLMERP/ArticleID/12946/PLM-This-Week-CIMdata-Report-Shows-Dassault-Systemes-is-a-PLM-Revenue-Leader-in-2015.aspx</ref>\n* [http://www.verosoftware.com/ Vero Software part of  HEXAGON: AlphaCAM, EdgeCAM, Machining Strategist, PEPS, SurfCAM, VISI, WorkNC / Dental]   \n* [http://www.autodesk.com/ Autodesk Inc.: HSM (Works, Express, Inventor), PowerMill, FeatureCAM, PartMaker, ArtCAM, Delcam Robot, Fusion 360]\n* [http://www.camworks.com/ Geometric Ltd.: CAMWorks]<ref>http://geometricglobal.com/media-section/2016-media-release/geometrics-revenues-grow-11-6-in-fy16/</ref>\n* [http://www.openmind-tech.com/ OPEN MIND Technologies: hyperMill]\n* [http://www.tebis.com/ Tebis Technische Informationssysteme AG: Tebis]\n* [http://www.Mastercam.com CNC Software Inc.: MasterCAM] \n* [https://www.3dsystems.com/ 3D Systems: Cimatron, GibbsCAM]\n* [http://www.ptc.com/manufacturing-software PTC: Creo]\n* [http://www.cgtech.com/ CGTech: VERICUT]\n* [http://www.topsolid.com/ Missler Software: TopSolid]\n* [http://www.sprutcam.com/ SPRUT Technology Ltd.:][[ SprutCAM]], SprutCAM Robot\n* [http://www.thinksai.com/ SAI Software: FlexiSign] \n* [http://www.type3.us/ Gravotech Group: TYPE3]\n* [https://www.mecsoft.com/ MecSoft Corporation: VisualCAM (VisualMill, VisualTURN, VisualNEST, VisualART), RhinoCAM, FreeMill]\n* [http://www.camtool.net/ C&G Systems: cam-tool] \n* [https://www.solidcam.com SolidCAM GmbH: SolidCAM]\n* [http://www.nttd-es.co.jp/ NTT Data Engineering Systems: Space-E (based on the Catia system)]\n* [http://www.bobcad.com/ BobCAD-CAM Inc.: BobCAD-CAM]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Computer-integrated manufacturing]] (CIM)\n* [[Digital modeling and fabrication]]\n* [[Direct numerical control]] (DNC)\n* [[Flexible manufacturing system]] (FMS)\n* [[Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing]] (ICAM)\n* [[Manufacturing process management]] (MPM)\n* [[STEP-NC]]\n* [[Rapid prototyping]] and [[rapid manufacturing]] \u2013 solid freeform fabrication direct from CAD models\n* [[CNC pocket milling]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM)}}\n*[http://www.cadsite.ru CADSite.ru] CAD Models\n*[http://www.MasteringCAM.com Mastering CAM] A Blog featuring all about Computer Aided Manufacturing.\n*[http://www.cimatron.com.br Cimatron Brazil] about Software CAD/CAM CimatronE\n*[http://cadem.com Mastering CAM] about Computer Aided Manufacturing.\n*[http://www.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/~smann/Papers/survey2.pdf Dragomatz and Mann] reviewed toolpath algorithms in 1997.\n*[http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~held/projects/pocket_off/pocket.html Pocket Machining Based on Offset Curves] by Martin Held\n* [https://engineering.purdue.edu/PRECISE/old/Development/Publications/links.html Purdue University] Purdue Research and Education Centre for Information Systems in Engineering\n* [http://www.sheetmetalworld.com/sheet-metal-news/fabrication-tutorials/23-it-tutorials/5930-how-to-evaluate-a-cadcam-system How to evaluate a CAM system] Sheetmetalworld.com article\n\n{{Metalworking navbox|machopen}}\n{{CAM software}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Computer-Aided Manufacturing}}\n[[Category:Computer-aided manufacturing| ]]\n[[Category:Information technology management]]\n[[Category:Product lifecycle management]]"}]}}}}
