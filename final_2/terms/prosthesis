Prosthetic amputee rehabilitation is primarily coordinated by a prosthetist and an inter-disciplinary team of health care professionals including psychiatrists, surgeons, physical therapists, and occupational therapists.\n\n==Types==\nA person's prosthetics should be designed and assembled according to the patient's appearance and functional needs. For instance, a patient may need a transradial prosthesis, but need to choose between an aesthetic functional device, a myoelectric device, a body-powered device, or an activity specific device. The patient's future goals and economical capabilities may help them choose between one or more devices.\n\ntch[[Craniofacial prosthesis|Craniofacial prostheses]] include intra-oral and extra-oral prostheses. Extra-oral prostheses are further divided into hemifacial, auricular (ear), nasal, [[Orbital prosthesis|orbital]] and [[Ocular prosthesis|ocular]]. Intra-oral prostheses include [[dental prostheses]] such as [[dentures]], [[palatal obturator|obturator]]s, and [[dental implant]]s.\n\nProstheses of the neck include [[larynx]] [[Electrolarynx|substitutes]], [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and upper [[esophagus|esophageal]] replacements,\n\n[[Somato prosthesis|Somato prostheses]] of the torso include [[breast prostheses]] which may be either single or bilateral, full breast devices or [[Nipple prosthesis|nipple prostheses]].\n\n===Limb prostheses===\n[[File:A formation of Marines, firemen and policemen running across Manhattan in 2007.jpg|right|thumb|A [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine]] with bilateral prosthetic legs leads a formation run]]\n[[Limb (anatomy)|Limb]] prostheses include both upper- and lower-extremity prostheses.\n\n'''Upper-extremity prostheses''' are used at varying levels of amputation: forequarter, shoulder disarticulation, transhumeral prosthesis, elbow disarticulation, transradial prosthesis, wrist disarticulation, full hand, partial hand, finger, partial finger.\n\nA transradial prosthesis is an artificial limb that replaces an arm missing below the elbow. Two main types of prosthetics are available. Cable operated limbs work by attaching a harness and cable around the opposite shoulder of the damaged arm. The other form of prosthetics available are [[myoelectric]] arms. These work by sensing, via [[electrode]]s, when the muscles in the [[Arm|upper arm]] move, causing an artificial hand to open or close. In the prosthetic industry a trans-radial prosthetic arm is often referred to as a \"BE\" or below elbow prosthesis.\n\n'''Lower-extremity prostheses''' provide replacements at varying levels of amputation. These include hip disarticulation, transfemoral prosthesis, knee disarticulation, transtibial prosthesis, Syme's amputation, foot, partial foot, and toe. The two main subcategories of lower extremity prosthetic devices are trans-tibial (any amputation transecting the tibia bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a tibial deficiency) and trans-femoral (any amputation transecting the femur bone or a congenital anomaly resulting in a femoral deficiency).\n\nA transfemoral prosthesis is an artificial limb that replaces a leg missing above the knee. Transfemoral amputees can have a very difficult time regaining normal movement. In general, a transfemoral amputee must use approximately 80% more energy to walk than a person with two whole legs.<ref name=\"four\" /> This is due to the complexities in movement associated with the knee. In newer and more improved designs, hydraulics, carbon fiber, mechanical linkages, motors, computer microprocessors, and innovative combinations of these technologies are employed to give more control to the user. In the prosthetic industry a trans-femoral prosthetic leg is often referred to as an \"AK\" or above the knee prosthesis.<ref>''Physics: A First Course.'' \"Connections, designing a better prosthetic leg\"</ref>\n\nA transtibial prosthesis is an artificial limb that replaces a leg missing below the knee. A transtibial amputee is usually able to regain normal movement more readily than someone with a transfemoral amputation, due in large part to retaining the knee, which allows for easier movement.  Lower extremity prosthetics describes artificially replaced limbs located at the hip level or lower. In the prosthetic industry a trans-tibial prosthetic leg is often referred to as a \"BK\" or below the knee prosthesis.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Prosthetic toe.jpg|thumb|Prosthetic toe from ancient Egypt]]\n[[File:Eiserne Hand Glasnegativ 6 cropped.jpg|thumb|Iron prosthetic hand believed to have been owned by G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen (1480\u20131562)]]\n[[File:Iron artificial arm, 1560-1600.

He followed the direction of Ivan Long and Ossur Christensen as they developed alternatives to the quadrilateral socket, which in turn followed the open ended plug socket, created from wood.<ref name=\"Long\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.oandplibrary.org/cpo/pdf/1985_04_009.pdf | title=Normal Shape-Normal Alignment (NSNA) Above-Knee Prosthesis | author=Long, Ivan A. | journal=Clin Prosthet Orthot | year=1985 | volume=9 | issue=4 | pages=9\u201314}}</ref> The advancement was due to the difference in the socket to patient contact model. Prior to this, sockets were made in the shape of a square shape with no specialized containment for muscular tissue. New designs thus help to lock in the bony anatomy, locking it into place and distributing the weight evenly over the existing limb as well as the musculature of the patient. Ischial containment is well known and used today by many prosthetist to help in patient care. Variations of the ischial containment socket thus exists and each socket is tailored to the specific needs of the patient. Others who contributed to socket development and changes over the years include Tim Staats, Chris Hoyt, and Frank Gottschalk. Gottschalk disputed the efficacy of the CAT-CAM socket- insisting the surgical procedure done by the amputation surgeon was most important to prepare the amputee for good use of a prosthesis of any type socket design.<ref name=\"Gottschalk-Kourosh-Stills\">{{cite journal | url=http://journals.lww.com/jpojournal/Citation/1989/10000/Does_Socket_Configuration_Influence_the_Position.9.aspx | title=Does Socket Configuration Influence the Position of the Femur in Above-Knee Amputation? |author1=Gottschalk, Frank A. |author2=Kourosh, Sohrab |author3=Stills, Melvin |author4=McClellan, Bruce |author5=Roberts, Jim | journal=Journal of Prosthetics & Orthotics | year=1989 | volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=94\u2013102 | doi=10.1097/00008526-198910000-00009}}</ref>\n\nThe first microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knees became available in the early 1990s. The Intelligent Prosthesis was first commercially available microprocessor controlled prosthetic knee. It was released by Chas. A. Blatchford & Sons, Ltd., of Great Britain, in 1993 and made walking with the prosthesis feel and look more natural.<ref>[http://www.blatchford.co.uk/about/company-history/ \u201cBlatchford Company History\u201d], Blatchford Group.</ref>  An improved version was released in 1995 by the name Intelligent Prosthesis Plus. Blatchford released another prosthesis, the Adaptive Prosthesis, in 1998. The Adaptive Prosthesis utilized hydraulic controls, pneumatic controls, and a microprocessor to provide the amputee with a gait that was more responsive to changes in walking speed. Cost analysis reveals that a sophisticated above-knee prosthesis will be about $1 million in 45 years, given only annual cost of living adjustments.<ref name=PikeAlvin/>\n\n==Patient procedure==\nA prosthesis is a functional replacement for an amputated or congenitally malformed or missing limb. Prosthetists are responsible for the prescription, design and management of a prosthetic device.\n\nIn most cases, the prosthetist begins by taking a plaster cast of the patient\u2019s affected limb. Lightweight, high-strength thermoplastics are custom-formed to this model of the patient. Cutting-edge materials such as carbon fiber, titanium and Kevlar provide strength and durability while making the new prosthesis lighter. More sophisticated prostheses are equipped with advanced electronics, providing additional stability and control.<ref>http://www.progoandp.com/services/prosthetics/</ref>\n\n==Current technology and manufacturing==\n[[File:WorkNC-Knee prosthesis.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Knee prosthesis manufactured using [[WorkNC]] [[Computer Aided Manufacturing]] software]]\nOver the years, there have been advancements in artificial limbs. New plastics and other materials, such as [[carbon fiber]], have allowed artificial limbs to be stronger and lighter, limiting the amount of extra energy necessary to operate the limb. This is especially important for trans-femoral amputees. Additional materials have allowed artificial limbs to look much more realistic, which is important to trans-radial and transhumeral amputees because they are more likely to have the artificial limb exposed.<ref name=\"three\">{{cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-1/Artificial-Limb.html |title=How artificial limb is made&nbsp;\u2013 Background, Raw materials, The manufacturing process of artificial limb, Physical therapy, Quality control |publisher=Madehow.com |date=1988-04-04 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref>\n[[File:Journal.pone.0019508.g004 prosthetic finger.png|left|thumb|Manufacturing a prosthetic finger]]\nIn addition to new materials, the use of electronics has become very common in artificial limbs. Myoelectric limbs, which control the limbs by converting muscle movements to electrical signals, have become much more common than cable operated limbs. Myoelectric signals are picked up by electrodes, the signal gets integrated and once it exceeds a certain threshold, the prosthetic limb control signal is triggered which is why inherently, all myoelectric controls lag. Conversely, cable control is immediate and physical, and through that offers a certain degree of direct force feedback that myoelectric control does not. Computers are also used extensively in the manufacturing of limbs. [[CAD/CAM|Computer Aided Design and Computer Aided Manufacturing]] are often used to assist in the design and manufacture of artificial limbs.<ref name=\"three\" /><ref name=\"sapphire\">{{cite journal |last1=Mamalis |first1=AG |last2=Ramsden |first2=JJ |last3=Grabchenko |first3=AI |last4=Lytvynov |first4=LA |last5=Filipenko |first5=VA |last6=Lavrynenko |first6=SN |title=A novel concept for the manufacture of individual sapphire-metallic hip joint endoprostheses |journal=Journal of Biological Physics and Chemistry |date=2006 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=113\u2013117 |doi=10.4024/30601.jbpc.06.03}}</ref>\n\nMost modern artificial limbs are attached to the stump of the amputee by belts and cuffs or by [[suction]]. The stump either directly fits into a socket on the prosthetic, or\u2014more commonly today\u2014a liner is used that then is fixed to the socket either by vacuum (suction sockets) or a pin lock. Liners are soft and by that, they can create a far better suction fit than hard sockets. Silicone liners can be obtained in standard sizes, mostly with a circular (round) cross section, but for any other stump shape, custom liners can be made. The socket is custom made to fit  the residual limb and to distribute the forces of the artificial limb across the area of the stump (rather than just one small spot), which helps reduce wear on the stump. The custom socket is created by taking a plaster cast of the stump or, more commonly today, of the liner worn over the stump, and then making a mold from the plaster cast. Newer methods include laser guided measuring which can be input directly to a computer allowing for a more sophisticated design.\n\nOne problem with the stump and socket attachment is that a bad fit will reduce the area of contact between the stump and socket or liner, and increase pockets between stump skin and socket or liner. Pressure then is higher, which can be painful. Air pockets can allow sweat to accumulate that can soften the skin. Ultimately, this is a frequent cause for itchy skin rashes. Over time, this can lead to breakdown of the skin.<ref name=\"four\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/slab/leg/default.htm |title=Getting an artificial leg up&nbsp;\u2013 Cathy Johnson |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref>\n\nArtificial limbs are typically manufactured using the following steps:<ref name=\"three\" />\n#Measurement of the stump\n#Measurement of the body to determine the size required for the artificial limb\n#Fitting of a silicone liner\n#Creation of a model of the liner worn over the stump\n#Formation of [[thermoplastic]] sheet around the model&nbsp;\u2013 This is then used to test the fit of the prosthetic\n#Formation of permanent socket\n#Formation of plastic parts of the artificial limb&nbsp;\u2013 Different methods are used, including [[vacuum forming]] and [[injection molding]]\n#Creation of metal parts of the artificial limb using [[die casting]]\n#Assembly of entire limb\n\n===Body-powered arms===\n\nCurrent high tech allows body powered arms to weigh around one-half to one-third of what a myoelectric arm does.\n\n====Sockets====\nCurrent body-powered arms contain sockets that are built from hard epoxy or carbon fiber. These sockets or \"interfaces\" can be made more comfortable by lining them with a softer, compressible foam material that provides padding for the bone prominences. A self suspending or supra-condylar socket design is useful for those with short to mid range below elbow absence. Longer limbs may require the use of a locking roll-on type inner liner or more complex harnessing to help augment suspension.\n\n====Wrists====\nWrist units are either screw-on connectors featuring the UNF 1/2-20 thread (USA) or quick-release connector, of which there are different models.\n\n====Voluntary opening and voluntary closing====\nTwo types of body powered systems exist, voluntary opening \"pull to open\" and voluntary closing  \"pull to close\". Virtually all \"split hook\" prostheses operate with a voluntary opening type system.\n\nMore modern \"prehensors\" called GRIPS utilize voluntary closing systems. The differences are significant. Users of voluntary opening systems rely on elastic bands or springs for gripping force, while users of voluntary closing systems rely on their own body power and energy to create gripping force.\n\nVoluntary closing users can generate prehension forces equivalent to the normal hand, upwards to or exceeding one hundred pounds. Voluntary closing GRIPS require constant tension to grip, like a human hand, and in that property they do come closer to matching human hand performance. Voluntary opening split hook users are limited to forces their rubber or springs can generate which usually is below 20 pounds.\n\n====Feedback====\nAn additional difference exists in the biofeedback created that allows the user to \"feel\" what is being held. Voluntary opening systems once engaged provide the holding force so that they operate like a passive vice at the end of the arm. No gripping feedback is provided once the hook has closed around the object being held. Voluntary closing systems provide directly [[Proportional Myoelectric Control|proportional control]] and biofeedback so that the user can feel how much force that they are applying.\n\nA recent study showed that by stimulating the median and ulnar nerves, according to the information provided by the artificial sensors from a hand prosthesis, physiologically appropriate (near-natural) sensory information could be provided to an amputee. This feedback enabled the participant to effectively modulate the grasping force of the prosthesis with no visual or auditory feedback.<ref name=\" pmid = 24500407 \">{{cite journal | author = Raspopovic S1, Capogrosso M, Petrini FM| title = Restoring natural sensory feedback in real-time bidirectional hand prostheses. | journal = Sci Transl Med. | volume = 6 | issue = 222 |date=Jan 2014 | pmid = 24500407 | url = http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/6/222/222ra19.short | pages = 222 | doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3006820|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nResearchers from \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale De Lausanne in Switzerland and the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna in Italy, implanted the electrodes into the amputee's arm in February 2013.

In the prosthetic industry a trans-tibial prosthetic leg is often referred to as a \"BK\" or below the knee prosthesis while the trans-femoral prosthetic leg is often referred to as an \"AK\" or above the knee prosthesis.\n\nOther, less prevalent lower extremity cases include the following:\n#Hip disarticulations&nbsp;\u2013 This usually refers to when an amputee or congenitally challenged patient has either an amputation or anomaly at or in close proximity to the hip joint.\n#Knee disarticulations&nbsp;\u2013 This usually refers to an amputation through the knee disarticulating the femur from the tibia.\n#Symes&nbsp;\u2013 This is an ankle disarticulation while preserving the heel pad.\n\n====Socket====\nThis important part serves as an interface between the residuum and the prosthesis, allowing comfortable weight-bearing, movement control and proprioception.<ref>Mak, A.F.T. and Zhang, M. and Boone, D.A. (2001) State-of-the-art research in lower-limb prosthetic biomechanicssocket interface: A review.</ref> Its fitting is one of the most challenging aspects of the entire prosthesis. The difficulties accompanied with the socket are that it needs to have a perfect fit, with total surface bearing to prevent painful pressure spots. It needs to be flexible, but sturdy, to allow normal gait movement but not bend under pressure.\n\n====Shank and connectors====\nThis part creates distance and support between the knee-joint and the foot (in case of upper-leg prosthesis) or between the socket and the foot. The type of connectors that are used between the shank and the knee/foot determines whether the prosthesis is modular or not. Modular means that the angle and the displacement of the foot in respect to the socket can be changed after fitting. In developing countries prosthesis mostly are non-modular, in order to reduce cost. When considering children modularity of angle and height is important because of their average growth of 1.9&nbsp;cm annually.<ref>Strait, E.

(2005) Perspectives on how and why feet are prescribed.</ref> Additionally it influences gait biomechanics by its shape and stiffness. This is because the trajectory of the center of pressure (COP) and the angle of the ground reaction forces is determined by the shape and stiffness of the foot and needs to match the subject's build in order to produce a normal gait pattern.<ref>Jian, Y. and Winter, D.A. and Ishac, M.G. and Gilchrist, L.

The microprocessor receives signals from its sensors to determine the type of motion being employed by the amputee. Most microprocessor controlled knee-joints are powered by a battery housed inside the prosthesis.\n\nThe sensory signals computed by the microprocessor are used to control the resistance generated by [[hydraulic cylinders]] in the knee-joint. Small valves control the amount of [[hydraulic fluid]] that can pass into and out of the cylinder, thus regulating the extension and compression of a piston connected to the upper section of the knee.<ref name=PikeAlvin>Pike, Alvin (May/June 1999). \"The New High Tech Prostheses\".

Some allow amputees to walk near walking speed or run. Variations in speed are also possible and are taken into account by sensors and communicated to the microprocessor, which adjusts to these changes accordingly. It also enables the amputees to walk down stairs with a step-over-step approach, rather than the one step at a time approach used with mechanical knees.<ref name=MartinCraigW>Martin, Craig W.

They can be susceptible to water damage and thus great care must be taken to ensure that the prosthesis remains dry.\n\n===Myoelectric===\nA '''myoelectric prosthesis''' uses [[electromyography]] signals or potentials from voluntarily contracted muscles within a person's residual limb on the surface of the skin to control the movements of the prosthesis, such as elbow flexion/extension, wrist supination/pronation (rotation) or hand opening/closing of the fingers. A prosthesis of this type utilizes the residual neuro-muscular system of the human body to control the functions of an electric powered prosthetic hand, wrist, elbow or foot.<ref>{{cite news|title=Amputees control bionic legs with their thoughts|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/20/us-iceland-mind-controlled-limb-idUSKBN0O51EQ20150520|publisher=Reuters|date=20 May 2015}}</ref> This is as opposed to an electric switch prosthesis, which requires straps and/or cables actuated by body movements to actuate or operate switches that control the movements of a prosthesis or one that is totally mechanical. It is not clear whether those few prostheses that provide feedback signals to those muscles are also myoelectric in nature. It has a self-suspending socket with pick-up electrodes placed over flexors and extensors for the movement of flexion and extension respectively.\n\nThe USSR was the first to develop a myoelectric arm in 1958,<ref>Wirta, R.

It then relays this information to a controller located inside the device, and processes feedback from the limb and actuator (e.g., position, force) and sends it to the controller. Examples include surface electrodes that detect electrical activity on the skin, needle electrodes implanted in muscle, or solid-state electrode arrays with nerves growing through them. One type of these biosensors are employed in [[myoelectric prosthesis|myoelectric prostheses]].\n\nA device known as the [[Controller (computing)|controller]] is connected to the user's nerve and muscular systems and the device itself. It sends intention commands from the user to the actuators of the device, and interprets feedback from the mechanical and biosensors to the user. The controller is also responsible for the monitoring and control of the movements of the device.\n\nAn [[actuator]] mimics the actions of a muscle in producing force and movement. Examples include a motor that aids or replaces original muscle tissue.\n\nTargeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) is a technique in which [[motor nerve]]s, which previously controlled [[muscle]]s on an amputated limb, are [[surgery|surgically]] rerouted such that they reinnervate a small region of a large, intact muscle, such as the [[pectoralis major]]. As a result, when a patient thinks about moving the thumb of his missing hand, a small area of muscle on his chest will contract instead. By placing sensors over the reinervated muscle, these contractions can be made to control movement of an appropriate part of the robotic prosthesis.<ref name=\"six\">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Kuiken TA, Miller LA, Lipschutz RD, Lock BA, Stubblefield K, Marasco PD, Zhou P, Dumanian GA |title=Targeted reinnervation for enhanced prosthetic arm function in a woman with a proximal amputation: a case study |journal=Lancet |date= February 3, 2007 |volume=369 |issue=9559 |pages=371\u201380 |pmid=17276777 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60193-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/editors/22730/ |title=Blogs: TR Editors' blog: Patients Test an Advanced Prosthetic Arm |work=Technology Review |date=2009-02-10 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref>\n\nA variant of this technique is called targeted sensory reinnervation (TSR).

Recently, robotic limbs have improved in their ability to take signals from [[Human brain|the human brain]] and translate those signals into motion in the artificial limb.

The [[Boston Digital Arm]] is a recent artificial limb that has taken advantage of these more advanced processors. The arm allows movement in five axes and allows the arm to be programmed for a more customized feel. Recently the [[i-Limb hand]], invented in Edinburgh, Scotland, by [[David Gow]] has become the first commercially available hand prosthesis with five individually powered digits. The hand also possesses a manually rotatable thumb which is operated passively by the user and allows the hand to grip in precision, power and key grip modes.\n\nAnother neural prosthetic is [[Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory]] [[Proto 1]].

This involves inserting a small permanent magnet into the distal end of the residual bone of subjects with upper limb amputations. When a subject rotates the residual arm, the magnet will rotate with the residual bone, causing a change in magnetic field distribution.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Li Guanglin |author2=Kuiken Todd A | year = 2008 | title = Modeling of Prosthetic Limb Rotation Control by Sensing Rotation of  Residual Arm Bone | url = | journal = IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering | volume = 55 | issue = 9| pages = 2134\u20132142 | doi=10.1109/tbme.2008.923914}}</ref> EEG signals which is electroencephalogram, a test that detects electrical activity in the brain using small flat metal discs attached to your scalp, essentially decoding human brain activity used for physical movement, are used to control the robotic limbs.

Some others however can be attached in a permanent way. One such example are exoprostheses (see below).\n\n===Direct bone attachment and osseointegration===\n{{Main article|Osseointegration}}\n[[Osseointegration]] is a method of attaching the artificial limb to the body. This method is also sometimes referred to as [[exoprosthesis]] (attaching an artificial limb to the bone), or endo-exoprosthesis.\n\nThe stump and socket method can cause significant pain in the amputee, which is why the direct bone attachment has been explored extensively. The method works by inserting a titanium bolt into the bone at the end of the stump. After several months the [[osseointegration|bone attaches itself]] to the titanium bolt and an abutment is attached to the titanium bolt. The abutment extends out of the stump and the (removable) artificial limb is then attached to the abutment. Some of the benefits of this method include the following:\n* Better muscle control of the prosthetic.\n* The ability to wear the prosthetic for an extended period of time; with the stump and socket method this is not possible.\n* The ability for transfemoral amputees to drive a car.\nThe main disadvantage of this method is that amputees with the direct bone attachment cannot have large impacts on the limb, such as those experienced during jogging, because of the potential for the bone to break.<ref name=\"four\"/>\n\n==Cosmesis==\nCosmetic prosthesis has long been used to disguise injuries and disfigurements. With advances in modern technology, [[cosmesis]], the creation of lifelike limbs made from [[silicone]] or [[PVC]] has been made possible. Such prosthetics, including artificial hands, can now be designed to simulate the appearance of real hands, complete with freckles, veins, hair, fingerprints and even tattoos.\nCustom-made cosmeses are generally more expensive (costing thousands of U.S. dollars, depending on the level of detail), while standard cosmeses come premade in a variety of sizes, although they are often not as realistic as their custom-made counterparts. Another option is the custom-made silicone cover, which can be made to match a person's skin tone but not details such as freckles or wrinkles. Cosmeses are attached to the body in any number of ways, using an adhesive, suction, form-fitting, stretchable skin, or a skin sleeve.\n\n==Cognition==\n{{Main article|Neuroprosthetics}}\n\nUnlike neuromotor prostheses, neurocognitive prostheses would sense or modulate neural function in order to physically reconstitute or augment cognitive processes such as [[executive function]], [[attention]], language, and memory.

Unlike the reoccurring cost of the prosthetic limbs, the patient will typically only pay the $2000 to $5000 for therapy during the first year or two of living as an amputee.  Once the patient is strong and comfortable with their new limb, they will not be required to go to therapy anymore. Throughout one\u2019s life, it is projected that a typical amputee will go through $1.4 million worth of treatment, including surgeries, prosthetics, as well as therapies.<ref name=\"Cost of a Prosthetic Limb\"/>\n\n===Low-cost===\n{{See also|3D printing}}\nLow-cost above-knee prostheses often provide only basic structural support with limited function. This function is often achieved with crude, non-articulating, unstable, or manually locking knee joints. A limited number of organizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), create devices for developing countries. Their device which is manufactured by CR Equipments is a single-axis, manually operated locking polymer prosthetic knee joint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/p0868/$File/Eng-Transfemoral.pdf |title=ICRC: Trans-Femoral Prosthesis&nbsp;\u2013 Manufacturing Guidelines |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref>\n\nTable.

These early devices can be characterized by a simple artificial attachment connecting one's residual limb to the ground.\n\nThe introduction of the [[Seattle Foot]] ([[Seattle Limb Systems]]) in 1981 revolutionized the field, bringing the concept of an [[Energy Storing Prosthetic Foot]] (ESPF) to the fore. Other companies soon followed suit, and before long, there were multiple models of energy storing prostheses on the market. Each model utilized some variation of a compressible heel. The heel is compressed during initial ground contact, storing energy which is then returned during the latter phase of ground contact to help propel the body forward.\n\nSince then, the foot prosthetics industry has been dominated by steady, small improvements in performance, comfort, and marketability.\n\nWith [[3D printing|3D printer]]s, it is possible to manufacture a single product without having to have metal [[Molding (process)|mold]]s, so the costs can be drastically reduced.<ref>[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/05/10/national/science-health/robot-arm-startup-taps-3-d-printers-in-quest-to-make-prosthetics-affordable/#.VeCJ9_btlBd Robot arm startup taps 3-D printers in quest to make prosthetics affordable]</ref>\n\n''[[Jaipur leg|Jaipur Foot]]'', an artificial limb from [[Jaipur]], [[India]], costs about US$40.\n\n===Open-source robotic prothesis===\n{{See also|Open-source hardware|Modular design|3D printing|Thingiverse}}\nThere is currently an [[open design]] Prosthetics forum known as the \"[[Open Prosthetics Project]]\".

This forum is specially focused on the development of prosthetics and tools for children in developing countries. The website is focused on storing and spreading information and improving development of open-source low-cost solutions.<ref>[http://www.patchproject.net PATCH Project website]</ref>\n\n[[Open Bionics]] is a company that is developing open-source robotic prosthetic hands.

(1998) Pain and Rehabilitation from Landmine Injury</ref> Mohan (1986) indicated in India a total of 424,000 amputees (23,500 annually), of which 10.3% had an onset of disability below the age of 14, amounting to a total of about 43,700 limb deficient children in India alone.<ref>Mohan, D.

It serves well as a short-term solution, but is prone to rapid contracture formation if the limb is not stretched daily through a series of range-of motion (RoM) sets <ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Strait, E. Prosthetics in Deceloping Countries</ref>\n\n===Bamboo, PVC or plaster limbs===\nThis also fairly simple solution comprises a plaster socket with a bamboo or PVC pipe at the bottom, optionally attached to a prosthetic foot. This solution prevents contractures because the knee is moved through its full RoM. The David Werner Collection, an online database for the assistance of disabled village children, displays manuals of production of these solutions <ref>David Werner Collection: http://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/global/david/dwe002/dwe00201.html</ref>\n\n===Adjustable bicycle limb===\nThis solution is built using a bicycle seat post up side down as foot, generating flexibility and (length) adjustability. It is a very cheap solution, using locally available materials.<ref>Cheng, V. (2004) A victim assistance solution. http://www.ispo.ca/files/bicycle-prosthesis.pdf</ref>\n\n===Sathi Limb===\nIt is an endoskeletal modular lower limb from India, which uses thermoplastic parts. Its main advantages are the small weight and adaptability.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Monolimb===\nMonolimbs are non-modular prostheses and thus require more experienced prosthetist for correct fitting, because alignment can barely be changed after production. However, their durability on average is better than low-cost modular solutions.\n\n== Cultural and social theory perspectives ==\nA number of theorists have explored the meaning and implications of prosthetic extension of the body. [[Elizabeth Grosz]] writes, \"Creatures use tools, ornaments, and appliances to augment their bodily capacities. Are their bodies lacking something, which they need to replace with artificial or substitute organs?...Or conversely, should prostheses be understood, in terms of aesthetic reorganization and proliferation, as the consequence of an inventiveness that functions beyond and perhaps in defiance of pragmatic need?\"<ref>Grosz, Elizabeth (2003). \"Prosthetic Objects\" in ''The State of Architecture at the Beginning of the 21st Century''. 96-97.</ref> [[Elaine Scarry]] argues that every artifact recreates and extends the body. Chairs supplement the skeleton, tools append the hands, clothing augments the skin.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Body in Pain: The Making and Unmaking of the World|last=Scarry|first=Elaine|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref> In Scarry's thinking, \"furniture and houses are neither more nor less interior to the human body than the food it absorbs, nor are they fundamentally different from such sophisticated prosthetics as artificial lungs, eyes and kidneys. The consumption of manufactured things turns the body inside out, opening it up ''to'' and ''as'' the culture of objects.\"<ref>Lupton and Miller (1992). \u201cStreamlining: The Aesthetics of Waste\u201d  in Taylor and Preston, eds. 2006.
