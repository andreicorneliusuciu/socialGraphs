London: Temple Press, [[Arthur C. Clarke]], 1950</ref> In practice, [[spaceflight]]s of this type are confined to travel between the planets of the [[Solar System]].\n\n==Current achievements in interplanetary travel==\nRemotely guided [[space probe]]s have flown by all of the planets of the Solar System from Mercury to Neptune, with the [[New Horizons]] probe having flown by the dwarf planet [[Pluto]] and the [[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn spacecraft]] currently orbiting the dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]].   The most distant spacecraft, [[Voyager 1]], has left the Solar System, while [[Pioneer 10]], [[Pioneer 11]], [[Voyager 2]] and [[New Horizons]] are on course to leave it.<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA Spacecraft Embarks on Historic Journey Into Interstellar Space|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-277|accessdate=20 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn general, planetary orbiters and landers return much more detailed and comprehensive information than fly-by missions.  Space probes have been placed into orbit around all the five planets known to the ancients:  first [[Mars]] ([[Mariner 9]], 1971), then [[Venus]] ([[Venera 9]], 1975; but landings on Venus and atmospheric probes were performed even earlier), [[Jupiter]] ([[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]], 1995), [[Saturn]] ([[Cassini/Huygens]], 2004), and most recently [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] ([[MESSENGER]], March 2011), and have returned data about these bodies and their [[natural satellite]]s.\n\nThe [[NEAR Shoemaker]] mission in 2000 orbited the large near-Earth asteroid [[433 Eros]], and was even successfully landed there, though it had not been designed with this maneuver in mind.  The Japanese [[ion drive|ion-drive]] spacecraft [[Hayabusa (spacecraft)|Hayabusa]] in 2005 also orbited the small [[near-Earth asteroid]] [[25143 Itokawa]], landing on it briefly and returning grains of its surface material to Earth.  Another powerful ion-drive mission, [[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]], has orbited the large asteroid [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] (July 2011\u2013September 2012) and later moved on to the dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], arriving in March 2015.\n\nRemotely controlled landers such as [[Viking program|Viking]], [[Mars Pathfinder|Pathfinder]] and the two [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s have landed on the surface of Mars and several [[Venera]] and [[Vega program|Vega]] spacecraft have landed on the surface of Venus. The [[Huygens probe]] successfully landed on Saturn's moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].\n\nNo manned missions have been sent to any planet of the Solar System.  [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo program]], however, landed twelve people on the [[Moon]] and returned them to [[Earth]].  The American [[Vision for Space Exploration]], originally introduced by President [[George W. Bush]] and put into practice through the [[Constellation program]], had as a long-term goal to eventually send human astronauts to Mars. However, on February 1, 2010, President Barack Obama proposed cancelling the program in Fiscal Year 2011.  An earlier project which received some significant planning by NASA included a manned fly-by of Venus in the [[Manned Venus Flyby]] mission, but was cancelled when the [[Apollo Applications Program]] was terminated due to NASA budget cuts in the late 1960s.\n\n==Reasons for interplanetary travel==\nThe costs and risk of interplanetary travel receive a lot of publicity \u2014 spectacular examples include the malfunctions or complete failures of unmanned probes such as [[Mars 96]], [[Deep Space 2]] and [[Beagle 2]] (the article [[List of Solar System probes]] gives a full list).\n\nMany astronomers, geologists and biologists believe that exploration of the Solar System provides knowledge that could not be gained by observations from Earth's surface or from orbit around Earth. But they disagree about whether manned missions make a useful scientific contribution \u2014 some think robotic probes are cheaper and safer, while others argue that either astronauts advised by Earth-based scientists, or spacefaring scientists advised by Earth-based scientists, can respond more flexibly and intelligently to new or unexpected features of the region they are exploring.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://zuserver2.star.ucl.ac.uk/~iac/spaceflight.html | title=The Scientific Case for Human Spaceflight | last=Crawford | first=I.A. | date=1998 | journal=Astronomy and Geophysics | pages=14\u201317 }}</ref>\n\nThose who pay for such missions (primarily in the public sector) are more likely to be interested in benefits for themselves or for the human race as a whole. So far the only benefits of this type have been \"spin-off\" technologies which were developed for space missions and then were found to be at least as useful in other activities ([http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/ NASA] publicizes spin-offs from its activities).\n\nOther practical motivations for interplanetary travel are more speculative, because our current technologies are not yet advanced enough to support test projects. But [[science fiction]] writers have a fairly good track record in predicting future technologies \u2014 for example [[Geosynchronous orbit|geosynchronous communications satellites]] ([[Arthur C. Clarke]]) and many aspects of computer technology ([[Mack Reynolds]]).\n\nMany science fiction stories (notably [[Ben Bova]]'s [[Grand Tour (novel series)|Grand Tour]] stories) feature detailed descriptions of how people could extract minerals from [[asteroid]]s and energy from sources including orbital [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s (unhampered by clouds) and the very strong [[magnetic field]] of Jupiter. Some point out that such techniques may be the only way to provide rising standards of living without being stopped by pollution or by depletion of Earth's resources (for example [[peak oil]]).\n\nFinally, colonizing other parts of the Solar System would prevent the whole human species from being exterminated by any one of a number of possible events (see [[Human extinction]]).  One of these possible events is an [[asteroid impact]] like the one which may have resulted in the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]]. Although various [[Spaceguard]] projects monitor the Solar System for objects that might come dangerously close to Earth, current [[asteroid deflection strategies]] are crude and untested. To make the task more difficult, [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s are rather sooty and therefore very hard to detect. Although carbonaceous chondrites are thought to be rare, some are very large and the suspected \"[[Chicxulub Crater|dinosaur-killer]]\" may have been a carbonaceous chondrite.\n\nSome scientists, including members of the [[Space Studies Institute]], argue that the vast majority of mankind eventually will live in space and will benefit from doing this.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ssi.org/?page_id=2 | title=A Space Roadmap: Mine the Sky, Defend the Earth, Settle the Universe | last=Valentine | first=L | date=2002 | publisher=Space Studies Institute, Princeton}}</ref>\n\n==Economical travel techniques==\nOne of the main challenges in interplanetary travel is producing the very large velocity changes necessary to travel from one body to another in the Solar System.\n\nDue to the Sun's gravitational pull, a spacecraft moving farther from the Sun will slow down, while a spacecraft moving closer will speed up. Also, since any two planets are at different distances from the Sun, the planet from which the spacecraft starts is moving around the Sun at a different speed than the planet to which the spacecraft is travelling (in accordance with [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's Third Law]]). Because of these facts, a spacecraft desiring to transfer to a planet closer to the Sun must decrease its speed with respect to the Sun by a large amount in order to intercept it, while a spacecraft traveling to a planet farther out from the Sun must increase its speed substantially.<ref name=curtisbook>{{cite book |last=Curtis |first=Howard |date=2005 |title=[[Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students]] |edition=1st |publisher=Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann |isbn=0750661690 |page=257}}</ref> Then, if additionally the spacecraft wishes to enter into orbit around the destination planet (instead of just flying by it), it must match the planet's orbital speed around the Sun, usually requiring another large velocity change.\n\nSimply doing this by brute force \u2013 accelerating in the shortest route to the destination and then matching the planet's speed \u2013 would require an extremely large amount of fuel. And the fuel required for producing these velocity changes has to be launched along with the payload, and therefore even more fuel is needed to put both the spacecraft and the fuel required for its interplanetary journey into orbit. Thus, several techniques have been devised to reduce the fuel requirements of interplanetary travel.\n\nAs an example of the velocity changes involved, a spacecraft travelling from low Earth orbit to Mars using a simple trajectory must first undergo a change in speed (also known as a [[delta-v]]), in this case an increase, of about 3.8&nbsp;km/s. Then, after intercepting Mars, it must change its speed by another 2.3&nbsp;km/s in order to match Mars' orbital speed around the Sun and enter an orbit around it.<ref name=marsdeltavs>{{cite web|title=Rockets and Space Transportation |url=http://www.pma.caltech.edu/~chirata/deltav.html |accessdate=June 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701211813/http://www.pma.caltech.edu/~chirata/deltav.html |archivedate=July 1, 2007 }}</ref> For comparison, launching a spacecraft into low Earth orbit requires a change in speed of about 9.5&nbsp;km/s.\n\n===Hohmann transfers===\n[[File:Hohmann transfer orbit.jpg|frame|right|Hohmann Transfer Orbit: a spaceship leaves from point 2 in Earth's orbit and arrives at point 3 in Mars']]\nFor many years economical interplanetary travel meant using the [[Hohmann transfer orbit]]. Hohmann demonstrated that the lowest energy route between any two orbits is an [[ellipse|elliptical]] \"orbit\" which forms a [[tangent]] to the starting and destination orbits. Once the spacecraft arrives, a second application of thrust will re-circularize the orbit at the new location. In the case of planetary transfers this means directing the spacecraft, originally in an orbit almost identical to Earth's, so that the [[aphelion]] of the transfer orbit is on the far side of the Sun near the orbit of the other planet. A spacecraft traveling from Earth to Mars via this method will arrive near Mars orbit in approximately 8.5 months, but because the orbital velocity is greater when closer to the center of mass (i.e. the Sun) and slower when farther from the center, the spacecraft will be traveling quite slowly and a small application of thrust is all that is needed to put it into a circular orbit around Mars. If the manoeuver is timed properly, Mars will be \"arriving\" under the spacecraft when this happens.\n\nThe Hohmann transfer applies to any two orbits, not just those with planets involved. For instance it is the most common way to transfer satellites into [[geostationary orbit]], after first being \"parked\" in [[low Earth orbit]]. However, the Hohmann transfer takes an amount of time similar to \u00bd of the orbital period of the outer orbit, so in the case of the outer planets this is many years &ndash; too long to wait. It is also based on the assumption that the points at both ends are massless, as in the case when transferring between two orbits around Earth for instance. With a planet at the destination end of the transfer, calculations become considerably more difficult.\n\n===Gravitational slingshot===\n{{main|gravitational slingshot}}\n[[File:Gravitational slingshot.svg|thumb|200px|Over-simplified example of gravitational slingshot: the spacecraft's velocity changes by up to twice the planet's velocity]]\nThe gravitational slingshot technique uses the [[gravity]] of planets and moons to change the speed and direction of a spacecraft without using fuel. In typical example, a spacecraft is sent to a distant planet on a path that is much faster than what the Hohmann transfer would call for. This would typically mean that it would arrive at the planet's orbit and continue past it. However, if there is a planet between the departure point and the target, it can be used to bend the path toward the target, and in many cases the overall travel time is greatly reduced. A prime example of this are the two crafts of the [[Voyager program]], which used slingshot effects to change trajectories several times in the outer Solar System. It is difficult to use this method for journeys in the inner part of the Solar System, although it is possible to use other nearby planets such as Venus or even the [[Moon]] as slingshots in journeys to the outer planets.\n\nThis maneuver can only change an object's velocity relative to a third, uninvolved object, \u2013 possibly the \u201ccentre of mass\u201d or the Sun. There is no change in the velocities of the two objects involved in the maneuver relative to each other.  The Sun cannot be used in a gravitational slingshot because it is stationary compared to rest of the Solar System, which orbits the Sun.  It may be used to send a spaceship or probe into the galaxy because the Sun revolves around the center of the Milky Way.\n\n===Powered slingshot===\n{{main|oberth effect}}\nA powered slingshot is the use of a rocket engine at or around closest approach to a body ([[periapsis]]). The use at this point multiplies up the effect of the delta-v, and gives a bigger effect than at other times.\n\n===Fuzzy orbits===\nComputers did not exist when [[Hohmann transfer orbit]]s were first proposed (1925) and were slow, expensive and unreliable when [[gravitational slingshot]]s were developed (1959). Recent advances in [[computing]] have made it possible to exploit many more features of the gravity fields of astronomical bodies and thus calculate even [[Low energy transfer|lower-cost trajectories]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://discovermagazine.com/1994/sep/gravitysrim419/article_view?b_start:int=1&-C= | title= Gravity's Rim | publisher=discovermagazine.com }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Belbruno |first=E. |date=2004 |url=http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/titles/7687.html |title=Capture Dynamics and Chaotic Motions in Celestial Mechanics: With the Construction of Low Energy Transfers |publisher=Princeton University Press |location= |isbn=9780691094809 }}</ref> Paths have been calculated which link the [[Lagrange points]] of the various planets into the so-called [[Interplanetary Transport Network]]. Such \"fuzzy orbits\" use significantly less energy than Hohmann transfers but are often much slower. They may not offer much advantage for manned missions or for research missions, but may be useful for high-volume transport of low-value [[commodity|commodities]] if humanity develops a space-based economy.\n\n===Aerobraking===\n[[File:Apollo cm.jpg|thumb|right|Apollo Command Module flying at a high [[angle of attack]] to aerobrake by skimming the atmosphere (artistic rendition)]]\n[[Aerobraking]] uses the [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] of the target planet to slow down. It was first used on the [[Apollo program]] where the returning spacecraft did not enter Earth orbit\nbut instead used a S-shaped vertical descent profile (starting with an initially steep descent, followed by a leveling out, followed by a slight climb, followed by a return to a positive rate of descent continuing to splash-down in the ocean) through Earth's atmosphere to reduce its speed until the parachute system could be deployed enabling a safe landing. Aerobraking does not require a thick atmosphere \u2013 for example most Mars landers use the technique, and [[Mars#Atmosphere|Mars' atmosphere]] is only about 1% as thick as Earth's.\n\nAerobraking converts the spacecraft's [[kinetic energy]] into heat, so it requires a [[heatshield]] to prevent the craft from burning up. As a result, aerobraking is only helpful in cases where the fuel needed to transport the heatshield to the planet is less than the fuel that would be required to brake an unshielded craft by firing its engines. This can be addressed by creating heatshields from material available near the target <ref>https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/744615main_2011-Hogue-Final-Report.pdf</ref>\n\n== Improved technologies and methodologies ==\n\nSeveral technologies have been proposed which both save fuel and provide significantly faster travel than the traditional methodology of using [[#Hohmann transfers|Hohmann transfers]]. Some are still just theoretical, but over time, several of the theoretical approaches have been tested on spaceflight missions.  For example, the [[Deep Space 1]] mission was a successful test of an [[ion drive]].{{cn|date=October 2016}} These improved technologies typically focus on one or more of:\n* [[Space propulsion]] systems with much better fuel economy. Such systems would make it possible to travel much faster while keeping the fuel cost within acceptable limits.\n* Using solar energy and [[in-situ resource utilization]] to avoid or minimize the expensive task of shipping components and fuel up from the Earth's surface, against the Earth's gravity (see \"Using non-terrestrial resources\", below).\n* Novel methodologies of using energy at different locations or in different ways that can shorten transport time or reduce [[cost]] per unit mass of [[space transport]]\n\nBesides making travel faster or cost less, such improvements could also allow greater design \"safety margins\" by reducing the imperative to make spacecraft lighter.\n\n===Improved rocket concepts===\n{{main|Spacecraft propulsion}}\nAll rocket concepts are limited by the [[rocket equation]], which sets the characteristic velocity available as a function of exhaust velocity and mass ratio, of initial (''M''<sub>0</sub>, including fuel) to final (''M''<sub>1</sub>, fuel depleted) mass.  The main consequence is that mission velocities of more than a few times the velocity of the rocket motor exhaust (with respect to the vehicle) rapidly become impractical.\n\n====Nuclear thermal and solar thermal rockets====\n[[File:Nuclear thermal rocket en.png|thumb|250px|Sketch of nuclear thermal rocket]]\nIn a [[nuclear thermal rocket]] or [[solar thermal rocket]] a working fluid, usually [[hydrogen]], is heated to a high temperature, and then expands through a [[nozzle|rocket nozzle]] to create [[thrust]]. The energy replaces the chemical energy of the reactive chemicals in a traditional [[rocket engine]]. Due to the low molecular mass and hence high thermal velocity of hydrogen these engines are at least twice as fuel efficient as chemical engines, even after including the weight of the reactor.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nThe US [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] and NASA tested a few designs from 1959 to 1968. The NASA designs were conceived as replacements for the upper stages of the [[Saturn V]] launch vehicle, but the tests revealed reliability problems, mainly caused by the vibration and heating involved in running the engines at such high thrust levels. Political and environmental considerations make it unlikely such an engine will be used in the foreseeable future, since nuclear thermal rockets would be most useful at or near the Earth's surface and the consequences of a malfunction could be disastrous. Fission based thermal rocket concepts produce lower exhaust velocities than the electric and plasma concepts described below, and are less suitable except for applications requiring high thrust-to-weight ratio, as in planetary escape.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n====Electric propulsion====\n[[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|Electric propulsion]] systems use an external source such as a [[nuclear reactor]] or [[solar cell]]s to generate [[electricity]], which is then used to accelerate a chemically inert propellant to speeds far higher than achieved in a chemical rocket. Such drives produce feeble thrust, and are therefore unsuitable for quick maneuvers or for launching from the surface of a planet. But they are so economical in their use of\n[[reaction mass]] that they can keep firing continuously for days or weeks, while chemical rockets use up reaction mass so quickly that they can only fire for seconds or minutes. Even a trip to the Moon is long enough for an electric propulsion system to outrun a chemical rocket \u2013 the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions took 3 days in each direction.\n\nNASA's [[Deep Space 1|Deep Space One]] was a very successful test of a prototype [[ion drive]], which fired for a total of 678 days and enabled the probe to run down Comet Borrelly, a feat which would have been impossible for a chemical rocket. [[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]], the first NASA operational (i.e., non-technology demonstration) mission to use an ion drive for its primary propulsion, is currently on track to explore and orbit the large [[main-belt asteroid]]s [[1 Ceres]] and [[4 Vesta]].  A more ambitious, nuclear-powered version was intended for an unmanned Jupiter mission, the [[Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter]] (JIMO), originally planned for launch sometime in the next decade. Due to a shift in priorities at NASA that favored manned space missions, the project lost funding in 2005.  A similar mission is currently under discussion as the US component of a joint NASA/ESA program for the exploration of [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]].\n\nA NASA multi-center Technology Applications Assessment Team led from the [[Johnson Spaceflight Center]], has as of January 2011 described \"Nautilus-X\", a concept study for a multi-mission space exploration vehicle useful for missions beyond [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO), of up to 24 months duration for a crew of up to six.<ref>[http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=36068 Nautilus-X] \u2013 NASA's Multi-mission Space Exploration Vehicle Concept</ref><ref>[http://spirit.as.utexas.edu/~fiso/telecon/Holderman-Henderson_1-26-11/Holderman_1-26-11.pdf NAUTILUS-X] NASA/JSC Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle, Jan. 26, 2011.</ref>  Although [[Nautilus-X]] is adaptable to a variety of mission-specific propulsion units of various low-thrust, high [[specific impulse]] (I<sub>sp</sub>) designs, nuclear ion-electric drive is shown for illustrative purposes.  It is intended for integration and checkout at the [[International Space Station]] (ISS), and would be suitable for deep-space missions from the ISS to and beyond the Moon, including [[Lagrangian point|Earth/Moon L1]], [[Lagrangian point|Sun/Earth L2]], [[Near-Earth object|near-Earth asteroidal]], and Mars orbital destinations.  It incorporates a reduced-g centrifuge providing artificial gravity for crew health to ameliorate the effects of long-term 0g exposure, and the capability to mitigate the space radiation environment.<ref>[http://moonandback.com/2011/02/21/nasa-team-produces-nautilus-x-a-fascinating-spacecraft/  \"NASA Team Produces NAUTILUS-X, A Fascinating Spacecraft\"] February 21, 2011</ref>\n\n====Fission powered rockets====\nThe electric propulsion missions already flown, or currently scheduled, have used [[solar electric]] power, limiting their capability to operate far from the Sun, and also limiting their peak acceleration due to the mass of the electric power source.  Nuclear-electric or plasma engines, operating for long periods at low thrust and powered by fission reactors, can reach speeds much greater than chemically powered vehicles.\n\n====Fusion rockets====\n[[Fusion rocket]]s,  powered by [[nuclear fusion]] reactions, would \"burn\" such light element fuels as deuterium, tritium, or <sup>3</sup>He.  Because fusion yields about 1% of the mass of the nuclear fuel as released energy, it is energetically more favorable than fission, which releases only about 0.1% of the fuel's mass-energy. However, either fission or fusion technologies can in principle achieve velocities far higher than needed for Solar System exploration, and fusion energy still awaits practical demonstration on Earth.\n\nOne proposal using a fusion rocket was [[Project Daedalus]].  Another fairly detailed vehicle system, designed and optimized for crewed Solar System exploration, \"Discovery II\",<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110610051632/http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2005/TM-2005-213559.pdf PDF] C. R. Williams et al., 'Realizing \"2001: A Space Odyssey\": Piloted Spherical Torus Nuclear Fusion Propulsion', 2001, 52 pages, NASA Glenn Research Center</ref> based on the D<sup>3</sup>He reaction but using hydrogen as reaction mass, has been described by a team from NASA's [[Glenn Research Center]].  It achieves characteristic velocities of >300&nbsp;km/s with an acceleration of ~1.7\u202210<sup>\u22123</sup> ''g'', with a ship initial mass of ~1700 metric tons, and payload fraction above 10%.\n\n====Exotic propulsion====\nSee the [[spacecraft propulsion]] article for a discussion of a number of other technologies that could, in the medium to longer term, be the basis of interplanetary missions. Unlike the situation with [[interstellar travel]], the barriers to fast interplanetary travel involve engineering and economics rather than any basic physics.\n\n===Solar sails===\n{{main|Solar sail}}\nSolar sails rely on the fact that light reflected from a surface exerts pressure on the surface. The [[radiation pressure]] is small and decreases by the square of the distance from the Sun, but unlike rockets, solar sails require no fuel. Although the thrust is small, it continues as long as the Sun shines and the sail is deployed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~diedrich/cgi/search.cgi?solar+sail | title=Abstracts of NASA articles on solar sails}}</ref>\n\nThe original concept relied only on radiation from the Sun \u2013 for example in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s 1965 story \"[[Sunjammer]]\". More recent light sail designs propose to boost the thrust by aiming ground-based [[laser]]s or [[maser]]s at the sail. Ground-based [[laser]]s or [[maser]]s can also help a light-sail spacecraft to ''decelerate'': the sail splits into an outer and inner section, the outer section is pushed forward and its shape is changed mechanically to focus reflected radiation on the inner portion, and the radiation focused on the inner section acts as a brake.\n\nAlthough most articles about light sails focus on [[interstellar travel]], there have been several proposals for their use within the Solar System.\n\nCurrently, the only spacecraft to use a solar sail as the main method of propulsion is [[IKAROS]] which was launched by [[JAXA]] on May 21, 2010. It has since been successfully deployed, and shown to be producing acceleration as expected.  Many ordinary spacecraft and satellites also use solar collectors, temperature-control panels and Sun shades as light sails, to make minor corrections to their attitude and orbit without using fuel. A few have even had small purpose-built solar sails for this use (for example Eurostar E3000 [[geostationary]] communications satellites built by [[EADS Astrium]]).\n\n===Cyclers===\nIt is possible to put stations or spacecraft on orbits that cycle between different planets, for example a [[Mars cycler]] would synchronously cycle between Mars and Earth, with very little propellant usage to maintain the trajectory. Cyclers are conceptually a good idea, because massive radiation shields, life support and other equipment only need to be put onto the cycler trajectory once. A cycler could combine several roles: habitat (for example it could spin to produce an \"artificial gravity\" effect); mothership (providing life support for the crews of smaller spacecraft which hitch a ride on it).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/air_space/2076326.html?page=1 | title=Buzz Aldrin's Roadmap To Mars | date=2005 | last=Aldrin | first=B | last2= Noland | first2=D | publisher=Popular Mechanics}}</ref> Cyclers could also possibly make excellent cargo ships for resupply of a colony.\n\n===Space elevator===\n{{main|Space elevator}}\nA space elevator is a theoretical structure that would transport material from a planet's surface into orbit.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/space_elevator_020327-1.html | title=The Space Elevator Comes Closer to Reality | last=David | first=D | publisher=space.com | date=2002}}</ref> The idea is that, once the expensive job of building the elevator is complete, an indefinite number of loads can be transported into orbit at minimal cost. Even the simplest designs avoid the [[vicious circle]] of rocket launches from the surface, wherein the fuel needed to travel the last 10% of the distance into orbit must be lifted all the way from the surface, requiring even more fuel, and so on. More sophisticated space elevator designs reduce the energy cost per trip by using [[counterweight]]s, and the most ambitious schemes aim to balance loads going up and down and thus make the energy cost close to zero. Space elevators have also sometimes been referred to as \"[[Space elevator|beanstalks]]\", \"space bridges\", \"space lifts\", \"space ladders\" and \"orbital towers\".\n\nA terrestrial space elevator is beyond our current technology, although a [[lunar space elevator]] could theoretically be built using existing materials.\n\n===Skyhook===\n{{main|Skyhook (structure)}}\n[[File:Mature non-rotating Skyhook.png|thumb|right|Non-rotating skyhook first proposed by E.

One alternative to transport more mass on interplanetary trajectories is to use up nearly all of the [[upper stage]] propellant on launch, and then refill propellants in Earth orbit before firing the rocket to [[escape velocity]] for a [[heliocentric orbit|heliocentric]] trajectory.  These propellants could be stored on orbit at a [[propellant depot]], or carried to orbit in a [[propellant tanker]] to be directly transferred to the interplanetary spacecraft.  For returning mass to Earth, a related option is to mine raw materials from a solar system celestial object, refine, process, and store the reaction products (propellant) on the Solar System body until such time as a vehicle needs to be loaded for launch.\n\n[[File:ITS Tanker (cropped).jpg|thumb|Rendering of an ''[[ITS tanker]]'' (top) transferring propellant to an ''[[Interplanetary Spaceship]]'' (bottom) in Earth orbit.]]\n\n==== On-orbit tanker transfers ====\n\nSpaceX is currently developing a new spacecraft design that will, on all Earth-away launches, utilize the long-duration spacecraft (tanker or spaceship) to play a role briefly as the [[second stage]]  of the launch vehicle to provide acceleration to [[orbital speed|orbital velocity]].  This approach is an unusual design approach launch vehicles designed prior to the 2010s.  The SpaceX ''[[Interplanetary Spaceship]]'' and ''[[ITS tanker]]'' are [[carbon-fiber]]-structure spacecraft propelled by nine [[Raptor (rocket engine family)|Raptor engines]] operating on [[subcooling|densified]] methane/oxygen propellants.

The plant will be expanded over multiple [[synodic period|synods]] as more equipment arrives, is installed, and placed into mostly-[[autonomous robot|autonomous production]].<ref name=spacex-itspresentation201609/>\n\nThe [[SpaceX Mars propellant plant|SpaceX propellant plant]] will take advantage of the large supplies of [[carbon dioxide]] and [[Water on Mars|water resources]] on Mars, mining the water (H<sub>2</sub>O) from subsurface [[ice]] and collecting CO<sub>2</sub> from the [[Atmosphere of Mars|atmosphere]].  A [[chemical plant]] will process the raw materials by means of [[electrolysis]] and the [[Sabatier reaction|Sabatier process]] to produce [[oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) and [[methane]] (CH<sub>4</sub>), and then [[Vacuum distillation|liquefy]] it to facilitate long-term storage and ultimate use.<ref name=spacex-itspresentation201609/>\n\n===Using non-terrestrial resources===\n:''See main article [[In-situ resource utilization]]''\n\nCurrent space vehicles attempt to launch with all their fuel (propellants and energy supplies) on board that they will need for their entire journey, and current space structures are lifted from the Earth's surface. [[In-Situ Resource Utilization|Non-terrestrial sources of energy and materials]] are mostly a lot further away, but most would not require lifting out of a strong gravity field and therefore should be much cheaper to use in space in the long term.\n\nThe most important non-terrestrial resource is energy, because it can be used to transform non-terrestrial materials into useful forms (some of which may also produce energy). At least two fundamental non-terrestrial energy sources have been proposed: solar-powered energy generation (unhampered by clouds), either directly by [[solar cell]]s or indirectly by focusing solar radiation on boilers which produce steam to drive generators; and [[electrodynamic tether]]s which generate electricity from the powerful magnetic fields of some planets (Jupiter has a very powerful magnetic field).\n\nWater ice would be very useful and is widespread on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn:\n* The low gravity of these moons would make them a cheaper source of water for space stations and planetary bases than lifting it up from Earth's surface.\n* Non-terrestrial power supplies could be used to [[electrolysis|electrolyse]] water ice into oxygen and hydrogen for use in [[bipropellant rocket]] engines.\n* [[Nuclear thermal rocket]]s or [[Solar thermal rocket]]s could use it as [[reaction mass]]. Hydrogen has also been proposed for use in these engines and would provide much greater [[specific impulse]] (thrust per kilogram of reaction mass), but it has been claimed that water will beat hydrogen in cost/performance terms despite its much lower specific impulse by orders of magnitude.<ref>[http://www.neofuel.com/moonice1000/ Origin of How Steam Rockets can Reduce Space Transport Cost by Orders of Magnitude]</ref><ref>[http://www.neofuel.com \"Neofuel\" -interplanetary travel using off-earth resources]</ref>\n\nOxygen is a common constituent of the [[moon]]'s crust, and is probably abundant in most other bodies in the Solar System. Non-terrestrial oxygen would be valuable as a source of water ice only if an adequate source of [[hydrogen]] can be found.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}<!-- if ice is found, then both O2 and H2 would be available, given the energy to melt and then electrolyze it -->  Possible uses include:\n\n* In the [[life support system]]s of space ships, space stations and planetary bases.\n* In rocket engines. Even if the other propellant has to be lifted from Earth, using non-terrestrial oxygen could reduce propellant launch costs by up to 2/3 for hydrocarbon fuel, or 85% for hydrogen. The savings are so high because oxygen accounts for the majority of the mass in most [[rocket propellant]] combinations.\n\nUnfortunately hydrogen, along with other volatiles like carbon and nitrogen, are much less abundant than oxygen in the inner Solar System.\n\nScientists expect to find a vast range of [[organic compound]]s in some of the planets, moons and comets of the [[outer Solar System]], and the range of possible uses is even wider. For example, [[methane]] can be used as a fuel (burned with non-terrestrial oxygen), or as a feedstock for [[petrochemical]] processes such as making [[plastic]]s. And [[ammonia]] could be a valuable feedstock for producing [[fertilizer]]s to be used in the vegetable gardens of orbital and planetary bases, reducing the need to lift food to them from Earth.\n\nEven unprocessed rock may be useful as rocket propellant if [[mass drivers]] are employed.\n\n==Design requirements for manned interplanetary travel==\n[[File:Nasa mars artificial gravity 1989.jpg|thumb|right|In the artistic vision, the spacecraft provides [[artificial gravity]] by spinning (1989)]]\n\n===Life support===\n[[Life support system]]s must be capable of supporting human life for weeks, months or even years.
