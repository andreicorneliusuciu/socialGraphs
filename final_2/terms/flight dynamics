These angles describe the vector direction of airspeed, important because they are the principal source of modulations in the aerodynamic forces and moments applied to the aircraft.\n\nSpacecraft flight dynamics involve three forces: propulsive (rocket engine), gravitational, and lift and drag (when traveling through the earth's or any other atmosphere).<ref>Depending on the vehicle's mass distribution, the effects of gravitational force may also be affected by attitude (and vice versa), but to a much lesser extent.</ref> Because aerodynamic forces involved with spacecraft flight are very small, this leaves gravity as the dominant force.\n\nAircraft and spacecraft share a critical interest in their orientation with respect to the earth horizon and heading, and this is represented by another set of angles,<ref>http://answersforpilots.com/116/how-aeroplane-change-their-direction</ref> \"yaw\", \"pitch\", and \"roll\", which angles match their colloquial meaning, but also have formal definition as an Euler sequence.<ref>[[Orientation (geometry)#Mathematical representations]]</ref>{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2015}} These angles are the product of the rotational equations of motion, where orientation responds to torque, just as the velocity of a vehicle responds to forces.  For all flight vehicles, these two sets of dynamics, rotational and translational, operate simultaneously and in a coupled fashion to evolve the vehicle's state (orientation and velocity) trajectory.\n\n==Aircraft==\n[[Image:Yaw_Axis_Corrected.svg|thumb|right|Axes to control the attitude of a plane]]\n{{main article|Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)}}\n:This section focuses on fixed-wing aircraft. For other kinds see [[aircraft]].\nFlight dynamics is the science of air-vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the [[angles of rotation]] in three [[dimensions]] about the vehicle's [[center of mass]], known as ''roll'', ''pitch'' and ''yaw''<ref>http://answersforpilots.com/116/how-aeroplane-change-their-direction</ref> (quite different from their use as [[Tait-Bryan angles]]).{{contradict-inline|article=Tait-Bryan angles|date=May 2015}}\n\nAircraft engineers develop [[control system]]s for a vehicle's orientation ([[Aircraft attitude|attitude]]) about its [[center of mass]]. The control systems include actuators, which exert forces in various directions, and generate rotational forces or [[moment (physics)|moment]]s about the center of gravity of the aircraft, and thus rotate the aircraft in pitch, roll, or yaw.  For example, a [[pitching moment]] is a vertical force applied at a distance forward or aft from the center of gravity of the [[aircraft]], causing the aircraft to pitch up or down.\n\nRoll, pitch and yaw refer, in this context, to rotations about the [[Aircraft principal axes|respective axes]] starting from a defined equilibrium state.  The equilibrium roll angle is known as wings level or zero bank angle, equivalent to a level [[Heeling (sailing)|heeling]] angle on a ship. Yaw is known as \"heading\".\n\nA [[fixed-wing aircraft]] increases or decreases the lift generated by the wings when it pitches nose up or down by increasing or decreasing the [[angle of attack]] (AOA). The roll angle is also known as bank angle on a fixed-wing aircraft, which usually \"banks\" to change the horizontal direction of flight. An aircraft is usually streamlined from nose to tail to reduce [[Drag (physics)|drag]] making it typically advantageous to keep the sideslip angle near zero, though there are instances when an aircraft may be deliberately \"sideslipped\" for example a [[Slip (aerodynamic)|slip]] in a fixed-wing aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n==Spacecraft and satellites==\n{{main article|Flight dynamics (spacecraft)}}\n[[Image:rollpitchyaw.jpg|thumb|right|Axes to control the attitude of a satellite]]\nThe forces acting on spacecraft are of three types: [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsive]] force (usually provided by the vehicle's engine thrust); [[gravitation]]al force exerted by the Earth and other celestial bodies; and [[aerodynamic force|aerodynamic lift and drag]] (when flying in the atmosphere of the Earth or another body, such as Mars or Venus). The vehicle's attitude must be taken into account because of its effect on the aerodynamic and propulsive forces.<ref>Depending on the vehicle's mass distribution, the effects of gravitational force may also be affected by attitude (and vice versa), but to a much lesser extent.</ref> There are other reasons, unrelated to flight dynamics, for controlling the vehicle's attitude in non-powered flight (e.g., thermal control, solar power generation, communications, or astronomical observation).\n\nThe flight dynamics of spacecraft differ from those of aircraft in that the aerodynamic forces are of very small, or vanishingly small effect for most of the vehicle's flight, and cannot be used for attitude control during that time. Also, most of a spacecraft's flight time is usually unpowered, leaving gravity as the dominant force.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Aerospace engineering]]\n[[Category:Aerodynamics]]\n[[Category:Spaceflight concepts]]"}]}}}}
