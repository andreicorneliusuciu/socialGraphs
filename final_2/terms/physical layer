Due to the plethora of available hardware technologies with widely varying characteristics, this is perhaps the most complex layer in the OSI architecture.\n\nThe physical layer defines the means of transmitting raw [[bit]]s rather than logical [[Network packet|data packets]] over a physical [[data link|link]] connecting [[network node]]s. The [[bit stream]] may be grouped into code words or symbols and converted to a physical [[signal (electronics)|signal]] that is transmitted over a hardware [[transmission medium]]. The physical layer provides an electrical, mechanical, and procedural interface to the transmission medium. The shapes and properties of the [[electrical connector]]s, the [[Frequency|frequencies]] to broadcast on, the [[modulation]] scheme to use and similar low-level parameters, are specified here.\n\nWithin the semantics of the OSI network architecture, the physical layer translates logical communications requests from the [[data link layer]] into hardware-specific operations to affect transmission or reception of electronic signals.\n\n== Physical signaling sublayer ==\nIn a [[local area network]] (LAN) or a [[metropolitan area network]] (MAN) using [[open systems interconnection]] (OSI) architecture, the '''physical signaling sublayer''' is the portion of the physical layer that:<ref name=\"FS1037C\">{{FS1037C}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tiaonline.org/market_intelligence/glossary/index.cfm?term=%26%23TC%5DSR%3FN%0A |title=physical signaling sublayer (PLS) |accessdate=2011-07-29}}</ref>\n* interfaces with the [[data link layer]]'s [[media access control]] (MAC) sublayer,\n* performs [[character (computing)|character]] encoding, [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]], reception and decoding and,\n* performs [[galvanic isolation]].\n\n== Relation to Internet Protocol  ==\nThe [[Internet protocol suite]], defined in RFC 1122 and RFC 1123, is a high-level networking description used for the Internet and similar networks. It does not define an equivalent layer that deals exclusively with hardware-level specifications and interfaces, as this model does not concern itself directly with physical interfaces. Several [[Request for Comments|RFCs]] mention a ''physical layer'' and ''data link layer'', but that is in the context of [[IEEE]] protocols. RFC 1122 and 1123 do not mention any physical layer functionality or physical layer standards.\n\n== List of services ==\nThe major functions and services performed by the physical layer are:\n* Bit-by-bit or [[symbol (data)|symbol-by-symbol]] delivery\n* Providing a standardized interface to physical [[transmission media]], including\n** Mechanical specification of [[electrical connector]]s and [[cable]]s, for example maximum cable length\n** Electrical specification of [[transmission line]] [[signal level]] and [[electrical impedance|impedance]]\n** Radio interface, including [[electromagnetic spectrum]] [[frequency allocation]] and specification of [[signal strength]], analog [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], etc.\n** Specifications for [[Infrared radiation|IR]] over [[optical fiber]] or a wireless IR communication link\n* [[Modulation]]\n* [[Line coding]]\n* [[Bit synchronization]] in synchronous [[serial communication]]\n* [[Start-stop signalling]] and [[flow control (data)|flow control]] in [[asynchronous serial communication]]\n* [[Circuit switching]]\n* [[Multiplexing]]\n** Establishment and termination of [[circuit switched]] connections\n* [[Carrier sense]] and [[CSMA/CD|collision detection]] utilized by some level 2 [[multiple access protocol]]s\n* [[Equalization (communications)|Equalization]] filtering, [[training sequence]]s, [[pulse shaping]] and other [[signal processing]] of physical signals\n* [[Forward error correction]]<ref>{{cite book|last1= Bertsekas|first1= Dimitri |last2=Gallager |first2= Robert |title= Data Networks |publisher= Prentice Hall |year= 1992|isbn= 0-13-200916-1|page=61}}</ref> for example bitwise convolutional coding\n* [[Bit-interleaving]] and other [[channel coding]]\n\nThe physical layer is also concerned with:\n* [[Bit rate]]\n* [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|Point-to-point]], multipoint or [[point-to-multipoint]] line configuration\n* Physical [[network topology]], for example [[bus network|bus]], [[ring network|ring]], [[mesh network|mesh]] or [[star network]]\n* [[Serial communication|Serial]] or [[Parallel communication|parallel]] communication\n* [[Simplex communication|Simplex]], [[Duplex (telecommunications)#Half-duplex|half duplex]] or [[Duplex (telecommunications)#Full-duplex|full duplex]] transmission mode\n* [[Autonegotiation]]\n\n== Technologies ==\nThe following technologies provide physical layer services:\n* [[1-Wire]]\n* [[ARINC 818]] Avionics Digital Video Bus\n* [[Bluetooth]] physical layer\n* [[CAN bus]] (controller area network) physical layer\n* [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]]\n* [[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]] [[RS-232]], [[EIA-422]], [[RS-423|EIA-423]], [[RS-449]], [[RS-485]]\n* [[Etherloop]]\n* [[Ethernet physical layer]] Including [[10BASE-T]], [[10BASE2]], [[10BASE5]], [[100BASE-TX]], [[100BASE-FX]], [[100BASE-T]], [[1000BASE-T]], [[1000BASE-SX]] and other varieties\n* [[GSM]] [[Um air interface]] physical layer\n* [[G.hn]]/[[G.9960]] physical layer\n* [[I\u00b2C]], [[I\u00b2S]]\n* [[IEEE 1394 interface]]\n* [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]]\n* [[Infrared Data Association|IRDA]] physical layer\n* [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] Recommendations: see [[ITU-T]]\n* [[Mobile Industry Processor Interface]] physical layer\n* [[Modulated ultrasound]]\n* [[Optical Transport Network]] (OTN)\n* [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]]\n* [[System Management Bus|SMB]]\n* [[Synchronous optical network|SONET/SDH]]\n* T1 and other [[T-carrier]] links, and E1 and other [[E-carrier]] links\n* [[TransferJet]] physical layer\n* [[USB]] physical layer\n* Telephone network [[modems]]- [[V.92]]\n* Varieties of [[802.11]] [[Wi-Fi]] physical layers\n* [[X10 (industry standard)|X10]]\n\n== Network equipment ==\nThe following [[network equipment]] provides physical layer services:\n* [[Network interface controller]]\n* [[Repeater]]\n* [[Network hub]]\n* [[Modem]]\n* [[Fiber media converter]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Clock recovery]]\n* [[Data transmission]]\n* [[Digital modulation]]\n* [[Line code]]\n* [[Pulse shaping]]\n* [[Bit synchronization]]\n* [[Channel model]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gorry/course/phy-pages/phy.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618154921/http://www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gorry/course/phy-pages/phy.html |archivedate=2009-06-18 |title=Physical Layer |author=Gorry Fairhurst |date=2001-01-01}}\n*[http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_PhysicalLayerLayer1.htm Physical Layer (Layer 1)]\n*[http://fmad.io/blog-10g-ethernet-layer1-overview.html 10G Layer 1 Walkthrough]\n*5G Layer 2 Walltrough\n\n[[Category:Physical layer protocols]]\n\n[[ru:\u0421\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c OSI#\u0424\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c]]"}]}}}}
