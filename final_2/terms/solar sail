A useful analogy may be a sailing boat; the light exerting a force on the mirrors is akin to a sail being blown by the wind. High-energy [[Laser propulsion|laser beams]] could be used as an alternative light source to exert much greater force than would be possible using sunlight, a concept known as beam sailing.\n\nSolar sail craft offer the possibility of low-cost operations combined with long operating lifetimes. Since they have few moving parts and use no propellant, they can potentially be used numerous times for delivery of payloads.\n\nSolar sails use a phenomenon that has a proven, measured effect on spacecraft. Solar pressure affects all spacecraft, whether in [[Interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary space]] or in orbit around a planet or small body. A typical spacecraft going to Mars, for example, will be displaced by thousands of kilometres by solar pressure, so the effects must be accounted for in trajectory planning, which has been done since the time of the earliest interplanetary spacecraft of the 1960s. Solar pressure also affects the orientation ([[Aircraft attitude]]) of a craft, a factor that must be included in [[spacecraft design]].<ref>Georgevic, R. M. (1973) \"The Solar Radiation Pressure Forces and Torques Model\", ''The Journal of the Astronautical Sciences'', Vol. 27, No. 1, Jan\u2013Feb.

In a letter to Galileo in 1610, he wrote, \"Provide ships or sails adapted to the heavenly breezes, and there will be some who will brave even that void.\" He might have had the comet tail phenomenon in mind when he wrote those words, although his publications on comet tails came several years later.<ref>Johannes Kepler (1604) ''Ad vitellionem parali pomena'', Frankfort; (1619) ''De cometis liballi tres '', Augsburg</ref>\n\n[[James Clerk Maxwell]], in 1861\u201364, published his theory of [[electromagnetic field]]s and radiation, which shows that light has momentum and thus can exert pressure on objects. [[Maxwell's equations]] provide the theoretical foundation for sailing with light pressure. So by 1864, the physics community and beyond knew [[sunlight]] carried [[momentum]] that would exert a pressure on objects.\n\n[[Jules Verne]], in ''From the Earth to the Moon'',<ref name=\"Verne1865\">Jules Verne (1865) ''De la Terre \u00e0 la Lune'' (''From the Earth to the Moon'')</ref> published in 1865, wrote \"there will some day appear velocities far greater than these [of the planets and the projectile], of which light or electricity will probably be the mechanical agent ... we shall one day travel to the moon, the planets, and the stars.\"<ref name=\"Impey\">Chris Impey, ''Beyond: Our Future in Space,'' W.

He wrote the relation p = E/c relating the [[momentum]] p and the [[energy]] E of a photon, where c is the [[speed of light]].\n\n[[Svante Arrhenius]] predicted in 1908 the possibility of solar radiation pressure distributing life spores across interstellar distances, providing one means to explain the concept of [[panspermia]]. He apparently was the first scientist to state that light could move objects between stars.<ref>Svante Arrhenius (1908) ''Worlds in the Making''</ref>\n\n[[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] first proposed using the pressure of sunlight to propel spacecraft through space and suggested, \"using tremendous mirrors of very thin sheets to utilize the pressure of sunlight to attain cosmic velocities\".<ref>Urbanczyk, Mgr., \"Solar Sails-A Realistic Propulsion for Space Craft\", Translation Branch Redstone Scientific Information Center Research and Development Directorate U.S. Army Missile Command Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, 1965.</ref> [[Friedrich Zander]] (Tsander) published a technical paper in 1925 that included technical analysis of solar sailing.

It is represented by the Greek letter \u03c3.\n\nA sail craft has a characteristic acceleration, a<sub>c</sub>, which it would experience at 1&nbsp;AU when facing the Sun. Using the value from above of 9.08 \u03bcN per square metre of radiation pressure at 1 AU, a<sub>c</sub> is related to areal density by:\n\n:a<sub>c</sub> = 9.08(efficiency) / \u03c3 mm/s<sup>2</sup>\n\nAssuming 90% efficiency, a<sub>c</sub> =  8.17 / \u03c3 mm/s<sup>2</sup>\n\nThe lightness number, \u03bb, is the dimensionless ratio of maximum vehicle acceleration divided by the Sun's local gravity.  Using the values at 1&nbsp;AU:\n\n:\u03bb = a<sub>c</sub> / 5.93\n\nThe lightness number is also independent of distance from the Sun because both gravity and light pressure fall off as the inverse square of the distance from the Sun. Therefore, this number defines the types of orbit maneuvers that are possible for a given vessel.\n\nThe table presents some example values. Payloads are not included. The first two are from the detailed design effort at JPL in the 1970s. The third, the lattice sailer, might represent about the best possible performance level.<ref name=\"Wright \" />  The dimensions for square and lattice sails are edges.  The dimension for heliogyro is blade tip to blade tip.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 300px; height: 120px;\"\n|-\n!Type\n!&nbsp;&nbsp;\u03c3 (g/m<sup>2</sup>)&nbsp;&nbsp;\n!&nbsp;a<sub>c</sub> (mm/s<sup>2</sup>)&nbsp;\n!&nbsp;&nbsp;\u03bb&nbsp;&nbsp;\n!Size (km)\n|-\n|Square sail\n|5.27\n|1.56\n|0.26\n|0.820\n|-\n|Heliogyro\n|6.39\n|1.29\n|0.22\n|15\n|-\n|Lattice&nbsp;sailer\n|0.07\n|117\n|20\n|0.840\n|}\n\n===Attitude control===\nAn active [[attitude control]] system (ACS) is essential for a sail craft to achieve and maintain a desired orientation. The required sail orientation changes slowly (often less than 1 degree per day) in interplanetary space, but much more rapidly in a planetary orbit. The ACS must be capable of meeting these orientation requirements. Attitude control is achieved by a relative shift between the craft's [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]] and its [[center of mass]]. This can be achieved with control vanes, movement of individual sails, movement of a control mass, or altering reflectivity.\n\nHolding a constant attitude requires that the ACS maintain a net torque of zero on the craft. The total force and torque on a sail, or set of sails, is not constant along a trajectory. The force changes with solar distance and sail angle, which changes the billow in the sail and deflects some elements of the supporting structure, resulting in changes in the sail force and torque.\n\nSail temperature also changes with solar distance and sail angle, which changes sail dimensions. The radiant heat from the sail changes the temperature of the supporting structure. Both factors affect total force and torque.\n\nTo hold the desired attitude the ACS must compensate for all of these changes.<ref name=\"wright 6+B\">Wright, ibid., Ch 6 and Appendix B.</ref>\n\n===Constraints===\nIn Earth orbit, solar pressure and drag pressure are typically equal at an altitude of about 800&nbsp;km, which means that a sail craft would have to operate above that altitude. Sail craft must operate in orbits where their turn rates are compatible with the orbits, which is generally a concern only for spinning disk configurations.\n\nSail operating temperatures are a function of solar distance, sail angle, reflectivity, and front and back emissivities. A sail can be used only where its temperature is kept within its material limits. Generally, a sail can be used rather close to the Sun, around 0.25&nbsp;AU, or even closer if carefully designed for those conditions.<ref name=\"Wright \" />\n\n==Applications==\nPotential applications for sail craft range throughout the [[Solar System]], from near the Sun to the comet clouds beyond Neptune.  The craft can make outbound voyages to deliver loads or to take up station keeping at the destination.  They can be used to haul cargo and possibly also used for human travel.<ref name=\"Wright \" />\n\n===Inner planets===\nFor trips within the inner Solar System, they can deliver loads and then return to Earth for subsequent voyages, operating as an interplanetary shuttle.  For Mars in particular, the craft could provide economical means of routinely supplying operations on the planet according to Jerome Wright, \"The cost of launching the necessary conventional propellants from Earth are enormous for manned missions. Use of sailing ships could potentially save more than $10 billion in mission costs.\"<ref name=\"Wright \"/>\n\nSolar sail craft can approach the Sun to deliver observation payloads or to take up station keeping orbits.  They can operate at 0.25 AU or closer.  They can reach high orbital inclinations, including polar.\n\nSolar sails can travel to and from all of the inner planets.  Trips to Mercury and Venus are for rendezvous and orbit entry for the payload.  Trips to Mars could be either for rendezvous or swing-by with release of the payload for [[Aerobraking|aerodynamic braking]].<ref name=\"Wright \" />\n\n[[File:Interplanetary solar sail shuttle summary table gif.gif|center|700px|Some sailing ship capabilities in the inner Solar System, showing payload in metric tons and trip times for two ship sizes.]]\n\n===Outer planets===\nMinimum transfer times to the outer planets benefit from using an indirect transfer (solar swing-by).  However, this method results in high arrival speeds.  Slower transfers have lower arrival speeds.\n\nThe minimum transfer time to Jupiter for ''a<sub>c</sub>'' of 1&nbsp;mm/s<sup>2</sup> with no departure velocity relative to Earth is 2 years when using an indirect transfer (solar swing-by).  The arrival speed (''V''<span style=\"font-size:140%;\"><sub>\u221e</sub></span>) is close to 17&nbsp;km/s.  For Saturn, the minimum trip time is 3.3 years, with an arrival speed of nearly 19&nbsp;km/s.<ref name=\"Wright \" />\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 300px; height: 120px;\"\n|+ Minimum times to the outer planets (''a<sub>c</sub>'' = 1&nbsp;mm/s<sup>2</sup>)\n|-\n!&nbsp;\n!&nbsp;&nbsp;Jupiter&nbsp;&nbsp;\n!&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturn&nbsp;&nbsp;\n!&nbsp;&nbsp;Uranus&nbsp;&nbsp;\n!&nbsp;&nbsp;Neptune&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n|Time, yr\n|2.0\n|3.3\n|5.8\n|8.5\n|-\n|Speed, km/s\n|17\n|19\n|20\n|20\n|}\n\n=== Oort Cloud / Sun's inner gravity focus ===\n\nThe Sun's inner [[Gravitational lens#Solar gravitational lens|gravitational focus]] point, lies at minimum distance of 550 AU from the Sun, and is the point to which light from distant objects is [[Two-body problem in general relativity#Bending of light by gravity|focused by gravity]] as a result of it passing by the Sun. This is thus the distant point to which solar gravity will cause the region of deep space on the other side of the Sun to be focused, thus serving effectively as a very large telescope objective lens.<ref>Eshleman, Von R., \"Gravitational lens of the Sun: its potential for observations and communications over interstellar distances,\" ''Science, Vol. 205'', No. 4411 (1979) pp. 1133-1135.</ref><ref name=lens>{{cite web|last1=Maccone|first1=Claudio|title=The Sun as a Gravitational Lens : A Target for Space Missions A Target for Space Missions Reaching 550 AU to 1000 AU|url=http://www.spaceroutes.com/astrocon/AstroconVTalks/Maccone-AstroconV.pdf|accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIt has been proposed that an inflated sail, made of [[beryllium]], that starts at 0.05 AU from the Sun would gain an initial acceleration of 36.4&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>, and reach a speed of 0.00264c (about 950&nbsp;km/s) in less than a day. Such proximity to the Sun could prove to be impractical in the near term due to the structural degradation of beryllium at high temperatures, diffusion of hydrogen at high temperatures as well as an electrostatic gradient, generated by the ionization of beryllium from the solar wind, posing a burst risk. A revised perihelion of 0.1 AU would reduce the aforementioned temperature and solar flux exposure.<ref>{{cite web|author=Paul Gilster |url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=4238 |title=An Inflatable Sail to the Oort Cloud |publisher=Centauri-dreams.org |date=2008-11-12 |accessdate=2015-02-02}}</ref>\nSuch a sail would take \"Two and a half years to reach the heliopause, six and a half years to reach the Sun\u2019s inner gravitational focus, with arrival at the inner Oort Cloud in no more than thirty years.\"<ref name=lens/> \"Such a mission could perform useful astrophysical observations en route, explore gravitational focusing techniques, and image Oort Cloud objects while exploring particles and fields in that region that are of galactic rather than solar origin.\"\n\n===Satellites===\n[[Robert L. Forward]] has commented that a solar sail could be used to modify the orbit of a satellite about the Earth. In the limit, a sail could be used to \"hover\" a satellite above one pole of the Earth. Spacecraft fitted with solar sails could also be placed in close orbits such that they are stationary with respect to either the Sun or the Earth, a type of satellite named by Forward a \"[[statite]]\". This is possible because the propulsion provided by the sail offsets the gravitational attraction of the Sun. Such an orbit could be useful for studying the properties of the Sun for long durations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Likewise a solar sail-equipped spacecraft could also remain on station nearly above the polar [[terminator (solar)| solar terminator]] of a planet such as the Earth by tilting the sail at the appropriate angle needed to counteract the planet's gravity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nIn his book ''[[The Case for Mars]]'', [[Robert Zubrin]] points out that the reflected sunlight from a large statite, placed near the polar terminator of the planet Mars, could be focused on one of the Martian polar ice caps to significantly warm the planet's atmosphere. Such a statite could be made from asteroid material.\n\n===Trajectory corrections===\nThe [[MESSENGER]] probe orbiting [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] used light pressure on its solar panels to perform fine trajectory corrections on the way to Mercury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/details.php?id=102 |title=MESSENGER Sails on Sun's Fire for Second Flyby of Mercury |date=2008-09-05 |quote=On September 4, the MESSENGER team announced that it would not need to implement a scheduled maneuver to adjust the probe's trajectory. This is the fourth time this year that such a maneuver has been called off. The reason? A recently implemented navigational technique that makes use of solar-radiation pressure (SRP) to guide the probe has been extremely successful at maintaining MESSENGER on a trajectory that will carry it over the cratered surface of Mercury for a second time on October 6.}}</ref> By changing the angle of the solar panels relative to the Sun, the amount of solar radiation pressure was varied to adjust the spacecraft trajectory more delicately than possible with thrusters. Minor errors are greatly amplified by [[gravity assist]] maneuvers, so using radiation pressure to make very small corrections saved large amounts of propellant.\n\n===Interstellar flight===\nIn the 1970s, [[Robert Forward]] proposed two [[beam-powered propulsion]] schemes using either lasers or [[maser]]s to push giant sails to a significant fraction of the [[speed of light]].<ref name=\"Forward1984RoundtripInterstellar\">{{Cite journal| author=Forward, R.L. | title=Roundtrip Interstellar Travel Using Laser-Pushed Lightsails | journal=J Spacecraft | volume=21 | issue=2 | pages=187\u2013195 | year=1984 | doi=10.2514/3.8632 |bibcode = 1984JSpRo..21..187F }}</ref>\n\nIn the science fiction novel ''[[Rocheworld]]'', Forward described a light sail propelled by super lasers. As the starship neared its destination, the outer portion of the sail would detach. The outer sail would then refocus and reflect the lasers back onto a smaller, inner sail. This would provide braking thrust to stop the ship in the destination star system.\n\nBoth methods pose monumental engineering challenges. The lasers would have to operate for years continuously at [[gigawatt]] strength. Forward's solution to this requires enormous solar panel arrays to be built at or near the planet Mercury. A planet-sized mirror or [[fresnel lens]] would need to be located at several dozen [[astronomical unit]]s from the Sun to keep the lasers focused on the sail. The giant braking sail would have to act as a precision mirror to focus the braking beam onto the inner \"deceleration\" sail.\n\nA potentially easier approach would be to use a maser to drive a \"solar sail\" composed of a mesh of wires with the same spacing as the wavelength of the microwaves directed at the sail, since the manipulation of microwave radiation is somewhat easier than the manipulation of visible light. The hypothetical \"[[Starwisp]]\" interstellar probe design<ref name=starwisp>Forward, Robert L., \"Starwisp: An Ultralight Interstellar Probe,\u201d ''J.

Masers spread out more rapidly than optical lasers owing to their longer wavelength, and so would not have as great an effective range.\n\nMasers could also be used to power a painted solar sail, a conventional sail coated with a layer of chemicals designed to evaporate when struck by microwave radiation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/technovel_sail_050211.html |title=Earth To Mars in a Month With Painted Solar Sail |publisher=SPACE.com |date=2005-02-11 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}</ref> The momentum generated by this [[evaporation]] could significantly increase the [[thrust]] generated by solar sails, as a form of lightweight [[ablative laser propulsion]].\n\nTo further focus the energy on a distant solar sail, Forward proposed a lens designed as a large [[zone plate]]. This would be placed at a location between the laser or maser and the spacecraft.<ref name=\"Forward1984RoundtripInterstellar\" />\n\nAnother more physically realistic approach would be to use the light from the Sun to accelerate.<ref>\"Solar Sail Starships:Clipper Ships of the Galaxy,\" chapter 6, [[Eugene F. Mallove]] and [[Gregory L. Matloff]], ''The Starflight Handbook: A Pioneer's Guide to Interstellar Travel'', pp. 89-106, John Wiley & Sons, 1989. ISBN 978-0471619123</ref> The ship would first drop into an orbit making a close pass to the Sun, to maximize the solar energy input on the sail, then it would begin to accelerate away from the system using the light from the Sun. Acceleration will drop approximately as the inverse square of the distance from the Sun, and beyond some distance, the ship would no longer receive enough light to accelerate it significantly, but would maintain the final velocity attained. When nearing the target star, the ship could turn its sails toward it and begin to use the outward pressure of the destination star to decelerate. Rockets could augment the solar thrust.\n\nSimilar solar sailing launch and capture were suggested for [[directed panspermia]] to expand life in other solar system. Velocities of 0.05% the speed of light could be obtained by solar sails carrying 10&nbsp;kg payloads, using thin solar sail vehicles with effective areal densities of 0.1&nbsp;g/m<sup>2</sup> with thin sails of 0.1&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]] thickness and sizes on the order of one square kilometer.

The sail is made of thin [[polyimide]] film, with evaporated aluminium on it.  It steers with electrically-controlled [[liquid crystal]] panels.  The sail slowly spins, and these panels turn on and off to control the attitude of the vehicle.  When on, they diffuse light, reducing the momentum transfer to that part of the sail.  When off, the sail reflects more light, transferring more momentum.  In that way, they turn the sail.<ref>{{cite web|last=JAXA|title=Small Solar Power Sail Demonstrator 'IKAROS'  Successful Attitude Control by Liquid Crystal Device|url=http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2010/07/20100723_ikaros_e.html|publisher=JAXA|accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref>  Thin-film [[solar cell]]s are also integrated into the sail, powering the spacecraft.  The design is very reliable, because spin deployment, which is preferable for large sails, simplified the mechanisms to unfold the sail and the LCD panels have no moving parts.\n\nParachutes have very low mass, but a parachute is not a workable configuration for a solar sail.

His sail would use panels of thin aluminium film (30 to 100 [[nanometre]]s thick) supported by a [[tension (physics)|tensile]] structure. The sail would rotate and would have to be continually under thrust. He made and handled samples of the film in the laboratory, but the material was too delicate to survive folding, launch, and deployment. The design planned to rely on space-based production of the film panels, joining them to a deploy-able tension structure. Sails in this class would offer high area per unit mass and hence accelerations up to \"fifty times higher\" than designs based on deploy-able plastic films.<ref name=Drexler />\n\nThe highest thrust-to-mass designs for ground-assembled deploy-able structures are square sails with the masts and [[guy (sailing)|guy]] lines on the dark side of the sail. Usually there are four masts that spread the corners of the sail, and a mast in the center to hold [[guy-wire]]s. One of the largest advantages is that there are no hot spots in the rigging from wrinkling or bagging, and the sail protects the structure from the Sun. This form can, therefore, go close to the Sun for maximum thrust. Most designs steer with small moving sails on the ends of the spars.<ref name=jpl>{{cite web|url=http://solarsails.jpl.nasa.gov/introduction/design-construction.html |title=Design & Construction|publisher=NASA JPL |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050311004606/http://solarsails.jpl.nasa.gov/introduction/design-construction.html |archivedate = 2005-03-11}}</ref>\n\n[[File:sail-design-types.gif|center]]\n\nIn the 1970s [[JPL]] studied many rotating blade and ring sails for a mission to rendezvous with [[Halley's Comet]]. The intention was to stiffen the structures using angular momentum, eliminating the need for struts, and saving mass. In all cases, surprisingly large amounts of tensile strength were needed to cope with dynamic loads. Weaker sails would ripple or oscillate when the sail's [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)|attitude]] changed, and the oscillations would add and cause structural failure. The difference in the thrust-to-mass ratio between practical designs was almost nil, and the static designs were easier to control.<ref name=jpl />\n\nJPL's reference design was called the \"heliogyro\". It had plastic-film blades deployed from rollers and held out by centrifugal forces as it rotated. The spacecraft's attitude and direction were to be completely controlled by changing the angle of the blades in various ways, similar to the cyclic and collective pitch of a [[helicopter]]. Although the design had no mass advantage over a square sail, it remained attractive because the method of deploying the sail was simpler than a strut-based design.<ref name=jpl />\n\nHeliogyro design is similar to the blades on a helicopter. The design is faster to manufacture due to lightweight centrifugal stiffening of sails. Also, they are highly efficient in cost and velocity because the blades are lightweight and long. Unlike the square and spinning disk designs, heliogyro is easier to deploy because the blades are compacted on a reel. The blades roll out when they are deploying after the ejection from the spacecraft. As the heliogyro travels through space the system spins around because of the centrifugal acceleration. Finally, payloads for the space flights are placed in the center of gravity to even out the distribution of weight to ensure stable flight.<ref name=jpl />\n\nJPL also investigated \"ring sails\" (Spinning Disk Sail in the above diagram), panels attached to the edge of a rotating spacecraft. The panels would have slight gaps, about one to five percent of the total area. Lines would connect the edge of one sail to the other. Masses in the middles of these lines would pull the sails taut against the coning caused by the radiation pressure. JPL researchers said that this might be an attractive sail design for large manned structures. The inner ring, in particular, might be made to have artificial gravity roughly equal to the gravity on the surface of Mars.<ref name=jpl />\n\nA solar sail can serve a dual function as a high-gain antenna.<ref name=ant>{{cite web|author=Khayatian, Rahmatsamii, Porgorzelski, UCLA and JPL|url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/12275/1/01-0276.pdf|title=An Antenna Concept Integrated with Future Solar Sails}}</ref> Designs differ, but most modify the [[metallizing|metalization]] pattern to create a holographic monochromatic lens or mirror in the radio frequencies of interest, including visible light.<ref name=ant />\n\n== Electric solar wind sail ==\n{{main article | Electric sail }}\n\n[[Pekka Janhunen]] from [[Finnish Meteorological Institute|FMI]] has invented a type of solar sail called the [[electric solar wind sail]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.fmi.fi/~pjanhune/Esail/|title=Solar Sails Could Send Spacecraft 'Sailing' Through Space|author=NASA}}</ref> Mechanically it has little in common with the traditional solar sail design. The sails are replaced with straightened conducting tethers (wires) placed [[radius|radially]] around the host ship. The wires are electrically charged to create an [[electric field]] around the wires. The electric field extends a few tens of metres into the plasma of the surrounding solar wind. The solar electrons are reflected by the electric field (like the photons on a traditional solar sail). The radius of the sail is from the electric field rather than the actual wire itself, making the sail lighter. The craft can also be steered by regulating the electric charge of the wires. A practical electric sail would have 50\u2013100 straightened wires with a length of about 20&nbsp;km each.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nElectric solar wind sails can adjust their electrostatic fields and sail attitudes.\n\n== Magnetic sail ==\n{{main article | Magnetic sail }}\n\nA [[magnetic sail]] would also employ the solar wind. However, the magnetic field deflects the electrically charged particles in the wind. It uses wire loops, and runs a static current through them instead of applying a static voltage.<ref>http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/library/meetings/fellows/nov99/320Zubrin.pdf</ref>\n\nAll these designs maneuver, though the mechanisms are different.\n\nMagnetic sails bend the path of the charged protons that are in the [[solar wind]]. By changing the sails' attitudes, and the size of the magnetic fields, they can change the amount and direction of the thrust.\n\n==Sail making==\n\n===Materials===\n\nThe most common material in current designs is a thin layer of aluminum coating on a polymer (plastic) sheet, such as aluminized 2&nbsp;\u00b5m [[Kapton]] film. The polymer provides mechanical support as well as flexibility, while the thin metal layer provides the reflectivity.  Such material resists the heat of a pass close to the Sun and still remains reasonably strong. The aluminum reflecting film is on the Sun side. The sails of ''[[Cosmos 1]]'' were made of [[metallized polyethylene terephthalate|aluminized PET film]] ([[PET film (biaxially oriented)|Mylar]]).\n\nDrexler developed a concept for a sail in which the polymer was removed.  The material developed for the Drexler solar sail was a thin aluminium film with a baseline thickness of 0.1&nbsp;\u00b5m, to be fabricated by vapor deposition in a space-based system. Drexler used a similar process to prepare films on the ground. As anticipated, these films demonstrated adequate strength and robustness for handling in the laboratory and for use in space, but not for folding, launch, and deployment.\n\nResearch by [[Geoffrey Landis]] in 1998\u20131999, funded by the [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts]], showed that various materials such as [[alumina]] for laser lightsails and [[carbon fiber]] for microwave pushed lightsails were superior sail materials to the previously standard aluminium or Kapton films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/4Landis.pdf|title=Advanced Solar- and Laser-pushed Lightsail Concepts|author=Geoffrey A. Landis, Ohio Aerospace Institute|year=1999}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Energy Science Laboratories developed a new [[carbon fiber]] material that might be useful for solar sails.<ref name=\"carbonsail_000302.html\">[http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/carbonsail_000302.html SPACE.com Exclusive: Breakthrough In Solar Sail Technology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101191444/http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/carbonsail_000302.html |date=January 1, 2011 }} (DEAD LINK!)</ref><ref>http://sbir.nasa.gov/SBIR/abstracts/99/sbir/phase1/SBIR-99-1-25.02-2034.html (NASA SBIR page) retrieved 25 Dec, 2015</ref> The material is over 200 times thicker than conventional solar sail designs, but it is so porous that it has the same mass. The rigidity and durability of this material could make solar sails that are significantly sturdier than plastic films. The material could self-deploy and should withstand higher temperatures.\n\nThere has been some theoretical speculation about using [[molecular manufacturing]] techniques to create advanced, strong, hyper-light sail material, based on [[Carbon nanotube|nanotube]] mesh weaves, where the weave \"spaces\" are less than half the wavelength of light impinging on the sail. While such materials have so far only been produced in laboratory conditions, and the means for manufacturing such material on an industrial scale are not yet available, such materials could mass less than 0.1&nbsp;g/m<sup>2</sup>,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news5890.html |title=Researchers produce strong, transparent carbon nanotube sheets |publisher=Physorg.com |date=2005-08-18 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}</ref> making them lighter than any current sail material by a factor of at least 30. For comparison, 5 micrometre thick [[Mylar]] sail material mass 7&nbsp;g/m<sup>2</sup>, aluminized Kapton films have a mass as much as 12&nbsp;g/m<sup>2</sup>,<ref name=jpl /> and Energy Science Laboratories' new carbon fiber material masses 3&nbsp;g/m<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=\"carbonsail_000302.html\"/>\n\nThe least dense metal is [[lithium]], about 5 times less dense than aluminium.  Fresh, unoxidized surfaces are reflective.  At a thickness of 20&nbsp;nm, lithium has an area density of 0.011&nbsp;g/m<sup>2</sup>.  A high-performance sail could be made of lithium alone at 20&nbsp;nm (no emission layer).  It would have to be fabricated in space and not used to approach the Sun. In the limit, a sail craft might be constructed with a total areal density of around 0.02&nbsp;g/m<sup>2</sup>, giving it a lightness number of 67 and a<sub>c</sub> of about 400&nbsp;mm/s<sup>2</sup>. [[Magnesium]] and [[beryllium]] are also potential materials for high-performance sails.  These 3 metals can be alloyed with each other and with aluminium.<ref name=\"Wright\" />\n\n===Reflection and emissivity layers===\nAluminium is the common choice for the reflection layer.  It typically has a thickness of at least 20&nbsp;nm, with a reflectivity of 0.88 to 0.90.  Chromium is a good choice for the emission layer on the face away from the Sun.  It can readily provide emissivity values of 0.63 to 0.73 for thicknesses from 5 to 20&nbsp;nm on plastic film.  Usable emissivity values are empirical because thin-film effects dominate; bulk emissivity values do not hold up in these cases because material thickness is much thinner than the emitted wavelengths.<ref name=\"Wright Ch4\">Wright, ibid. Ch 4</ref>\n\n===Fabrication===\nSails are fabricated on Earth on long tables where ribbons are unrolled and joined to create the sails. Sail material needed to have as little weight as possible because it would require the use of the shuttle to carry the craft into orbit. Thus, these sails are packed, launched, and unfurled in space.<ref>Rowe, W. m. 'Sail film materials and supporting structure for a solar sail, a preliminary design, volume 4.\" Jet Propulsion Lab. California, Pasadena, California.</ref>\n\nIn the future, fabrication could take place in orbit inside large frames that support the sail.  This would result in lower mass sails and elimination of the risk of deployment failure.\n\n==Operations==\n[[File:Sail-InOut.gif|thumb|A solar sail can spiral inward or outward by setting the sail angle]]\n\n===Changing orbits===\nSailing operations are simplest in interplanetary orbits, where attitude changes are done at low rates. For outward bound trajectories, the sail force vector is oriented forward of the Sun line, which increases orbital energy and angular momentum, resulting in the craft moving farther from the Sun. For inward trajectories, the sail force vector is oriented behind the Sun line, which decreases orbital energy and angular momentum, resulting in the craft moving in toward the Sun.  It is worth noting that only the Sun's gravity pulls the craft toward the Sun\u2014there is no analog to a sailboat's tacking to windward. To change orbital inclination, the force vector is turned out of the plane of the velocity vector.\n\nIn orbits around planets or other bodies, the sail is oriented so that its force vector has a component along the velocity vector, either in the direction of motion for an outward spiral, or against the direction of motion for an inward spiral.\n\nTrajectory optimizations can often require intervals of reduced or zero thrust.  This can be achieved by rolling the craft around the Sun line with the sail set at an appropriate angle to reduce or remove the thrust.<ref name=\"Wright Ch1\" />\n\n===Swing-by maneuvers===\nA close solar passage can be used to increase a craft's energy.  The increased radiation pressure combines with the efficacy of being deep in the Sun's gravity well to substantially increase the energy for runs to the outer Solar System.  The optimal approach to the Sun is done by increasing the orbital eccentricity while keeping the energy level as high as practical.  The minimum approach distance is a function of sail angle, thermal properties of the sail and other structure, load effects on structure, and sail optical characteristics (reflectivity and emissivity).  A close passage can result in substantial optical degradation.  Required turn rates can increase substantially for a close passage.  A sail craft arriving at a star can use a close passage to reduce energy, which also applies to a sail craft on a return trip from the outer Solar System.\n\nA lunar swing-by can have important benefits for trajectories leaving from or arriving at Earth.  This can reduce trip times, especially in cases where the sail is heavily loaded.  A swing-by can also be used to obtain favorable departure or arrival directions relative to Earth.\n\nA planetary swing-by could also be employed similar to what is done with coasting spacecraft, but good alignments might not exist due to the requirements for overall optimization of the trajectory.<ref>Wright, ibid., Ch 6 and Appendix C.</ref>\n\n===Smart lines===\nA smart line could be a critical element of sailing operations. As with maritime ships, lines are essential for a wide range of uses. One difference is that some lines may be very long and need to be self-guiding.  The lines could extend from and retract into the sail craft.\n\nA maneuverable grappling device can be used at the end of a line to place or pick up payload containers, to secure a ship to a structure such as a station, to pick up samples from an asteroid or comet, or to engage in towing. The maneuvering unit is like a small spacecraft, with many of the same sensors and control systems.  It could draw power from and communicate with the sail craft through the line.  These operations could be done autonomously.\n\nLines a few hundred kilometers long may be used to move a ship from a space station to an orbit farther out where it could begin sailing.<ref>[http://sail.quarkweb.com/operations.htm#lines Smart lines for sailing operations]</ref>\n\n===Towing===\nSmart lines can enable towing operations by being able to attach to or release objects at the remote end of the line.  Attached objects might be pulled in to the body of the sailer or remain at the end of the deployed line.  Objects to be towed may have attachment points that allow multiple sail craft to engage in the towing.  Towing operations can include deflecting large bodies that pose a hazard to Earth, bringing natural bodies to Earth or other sites for resource recovery, and transporting disabled spacecraft or other structures.\n\nTo tow or deflect a large body, poles can be inserted on the spin axis of the body.  Sail craft can attach to the embedded poles using smart lines.  Slip rings enable the craft to tow without the lines getting wrapped up as a result of rotation of the body.<ref name=\"Wright Ch1\">Wright, ibid., chapter 1.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sail.quarkweb.com/voyages.htm#deflection |title=Asteroid deflection/towing}}</ref>\n\n==Projects operating or completed==\n\n===IKAROS 2010===\n{{Main article|IKAROS}}\n[[File:IKAROS IAC 2010.jpg|thumb|220px|The model of IKAROS at the 61st [[International Astronautical Congress]] in 2010]]\n\nOn 21 May 2010, [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA) launched the [[world]]'s first [[Interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary]] solar sail [[spacecraft]] \"[[IKAROS]]\" ('''''I'''nterplanetary '''K'''ite-craft '''A'''ccelerated by '''R'''adiation '''O'''f the '''S'''un'') to Venus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jspec.jaxa.jp/e/activity/ikaros.html |title=IKAROS Project\uff5cJAXA Space Exploration Center |publisher=Jspec.jaxa.jp |date=2010-05-21 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}</ref>\n\nJAXA successfully tested IKAROS in 2010.

While most direct applications created so far intend to use the sails as inexpensive modes of cargo transport, some scientists are investigating the possibility of using solar sails as a means of transporting humans. This goal is strongly related to the management of very large (i.e. well above 1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) surfaces in space and the sail making advancements.

Krasnogorskii published ''On the Waves of the Ether''. In his story backed by technical calculations, a small, bullet-shaped capsule is surrounded by a circular mirror 35 meters in diameter. It travels through space by means of solar pressure on the mirror.<ref name= \"wright\" />\n\nOne of the earliest American stories about light sails is \"The Lady Who Sailed the Soul\" by [[Cordwainer Smith]], which was published in 1960. In it, a tragedy results from the slowness of interstellar travel by this method. Another example is the 1962 story \"[[Gateway to Strangeness]]\" (also known as \"Sail 25\") by [[Jack Vance]], in which the outward direction of propulsion poses a life-threatening dilemma. Also in early 20th century literature, [[Pierre Boulle]]'s ''[[Planet of the Apes (novel)|Planet of the Apes]]'' novel starts with a couple floating in space on a ship propelled and maneuvered by light sails.\n\nBoth [[Arthur C. Clarke]] and [[Poul Anderson]], independently published distinct stories titled \"[[Sunjammer]]\" in March 1964. Clarke's, published in the March 1964 issue of [[Boys' Life]], depicted a \"yacht race\" between solar sail spacecraft; Anderson, in the April 1964 issue of [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|''Analog Science Fiction / Science Fact'']], depicts a maintenance crew, servicing space-freighters powered by light sails.\n\n[[Interstellar travel]] by using light sails was used in [[Larry Niven]] and [[Jerry Pournelle]]'s 1974 ''[[The Mote in God's Eye]]'', in which a sail is used as a brake and a weapon.  In \"[[The Flight of the Dragonfly]]\", [[Robert Forward]] (who also proposed the microwave-pushed Starwisp design) described an interstellar journey using a light driven propulsion system, wherein a part of the sail was broken off and used as a reflector to slow the main spacecraft as it approached its destination. Forward's ideas were developed further in [[Buzz Aldrin]] and [[John Barnes (author)|John Barnes]] 1996 science fiction novel \"[[Encounter with Tiber]]\", where the alien race 'the tiberians' use a solar sail powered first by a close flybys with [[Alpha Centauri]] A and B followed by laser boosting to travel to Earth some 9000 years ago. Their spaceship decelerate by detaching part of the light sail as well as using magnetic braking in the solar wind. [[Charles Stross]]'s 2005 novel ''[[Accelerando]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando.html#Router|title=''Accelerando''|last=Stross|first=Charles|year=2005|publisher=Antipope.org|accessdate=2013-11-30}}</ref> also developed interstellar travel by sail.\n\nIn visual media, in the 1982 film ''[[Tron]]'', in the computer simulation, a \"Solar Sailer\" was a craft with butterfly-like sails which moved along focused beams of light. The 1983 episode \"[[Enlightenment (Doctor Who)|Enlightenment]]\" of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' featured sailing ships in space that used solar wind to fly. In the episode \"[[Explorers (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|''Explorers'']]\" of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' that aired in 1995, a reconstructed, \"ancient\" [[Bajor]]an \"light ship\" was featured. It was designed to use solar wind to fly out of a Solar System with no engine. In the film ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'' one is used by [[Count Dooku]] to propel himself across space. A solar sail was also used in James Cameron's ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''. In the Disney film ''[[Treasure Planet]]'', solar sails are used literally as sails for interstellar travel as well as serving for the photovoltaic gathering of energy for the jet propulsion of a [[steampunk]]-styled masted sailing ship capable of traveling through space.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n* [[LightSail-1]]\n* [[Optical lift]]\n* [[Poynting\u2013Robertson effect]]\n* [[Sailcraft]]\n* [[Yarkovsky effect]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*G.
