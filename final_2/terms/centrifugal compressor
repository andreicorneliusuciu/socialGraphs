This kinetic energy is then converted to an increase in [[potential energy]]/static pressure by slowing the [[fluid dynamics|flow]] through a diffuser. The pressure rise in impeller is in most cases almost equal to the rise in the diffuser section.\n\n== Theory of operation ==\nIn the case of where flow simply passes through a straight pipe to enter a centrifugal compressor; the flow is straight, uniform and has no vorticity. As illustrated below \u03b1{{sub|1}} = 0\u00b0.{{clarify|date=March 2016}} As the flow continues to pass into and through the centrifugal impeller, the impeller forces the flow to spin faster and faster. According to a form of [[Euler]]'s fluid dynamics equation, known as ''[[Euler's pump and turbine equation|pump and turbine equation]]'', the energy input to the fluid is proportional to the flow's local spinning velocity multiplied by the local impeller [[tangential velocity]].\n\nIn many cases the flow leaving centrifugal impeller is near the [[speed of sound]] (340 metres/second). The flow then typically flows through a stationary compressor causing it to decelerate. These stationary compressors are actually static [[guide vane]]s where energy transformation takes place. As described in [[Bernoulli's principle]], this reduction in velocity causes the pressure to rise leading to a compressed fluid.<ref name=\"Shepard\"/>\n\n== Historical contributions, the pioneers ==\nOver the past 100 years, applied scientists including [[Aurel Stodola|Stodola]] (1903, 1927\u20131945),<ref name=\"Stodola\">\n{{cite book\n|author=Aurel Stodola\n|title=Steam and Gas Turbines\n|publisher=P.

This first part of the centrifugal impeller is also termed an ''inducer''. Centrifugal compressors differ from axials as they use a greater change in radius from inlet to exit of the rotor/impeller. The 1940s-era German [[Heinkel HeS 011]] experimental aviation turbojet engine was the first aviation turbojet design to have any sort of \"mixed compressor\" design in its fore-sections, as it had a single-stage [[Mixed flow compressor|\"diagonal flow\" main compressor]] ahead of a triple-stage axial unit, driven by a twin-stage turbine.  \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Centrifugal fan ===\n{{multiple image\n| align=left\n| direction=vertical\n| width=220\n| image1=CentrifugalCompressor.jpg\n| caption1=A low speed, low pressure centrifugal compressor or [[centrifugal fan]], with upward discharging cone used to diffuse the air velocity\n| image2=CentrifugalFan.png\n| caption2=A [[squirrel-cage fan]], without a discharge diffuser\n}}\nCentrifugal compressors are also similar to [[centrifugal fan]]s of the style shown in neighboring figure as they both increase the flows energy through increasing radius.<ref name=\"Shepard\"/> In contrast to centrifugal fans, compressors operate at higher speeds to generate greater pressure rises. In many cases the engineering methods used to design a centrifugal fan are the same as those to design a centrifugal compressor. As a result, they can at times look very similar.\n\nThis relationship is less true in comparison to a [[squirrel-cage fan]] as shown in figure farthest right.\n\nFor purposes of generalization and definition, it can be said that centrifugal compressors often have density increases greater than 5 percent. Also, they often experience relative fluid velocities above [[Mach number]] 0.3<ref name=\"Lakshminarayana\"/><ref name=\"API673\">{{cite book|last=API|title=Std 673-2002 Centrifugal Fans for Petroleum, Chemical and Gas Industry Services|year=July 2002|publisher=API|location=New York|url=http://global.ihs.com/doc_detail.cfm?item_s_key=00392744/}}</ref> when the working fluid is air or nitrogen. In contrast, fans or blowers are often considered to have density increases of less than five percent and peak relative fluid velocities below Mach 0.3.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Centrifugal pump ===\n{{multiple image\n| align=left\n| direction=vertical\n| width=220\n| image1=Centrifugal Pump-mod.jpg\n| caption1=A 3D-solids model of a type of [[centrifugal pump]]\n| image2=Centrifugal Pump.png\n| caption2=Cut-away of a [[centrifugal pump]]\n}}\nCentrifugal compressors are also similar to [[centrifugal pump]]s<ref name=\"Shepard\"/> of the style shown in the adjacent figures. The key difference between such compressors and pumps is that the compressor working fluid is a gas (compressible) and the pump working fluid is liquid (incompressible). Again, the engineering methods used to design a centrifugal pump are the same as those to design a centrifugal compressor. Yet, there is one important difference: the need to deal with [[cavitation]] in pumps.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Radial turbine ===\n[[File:RadialInflowturbine.JPG|thumb|left|Cutaway showing a radial-inflow turbine that looks similar to the turbine shown in Figure 3.1]]\nCentrifugal compressors also look very similar to their turbomachinery counterpart the [[radial turbine]] as shown in the figure. While a compressor transfers energy into a flow to raise its pressure, a turbine operates in reverse, by extracting energy from a flow, thus reducing its pressure.<ref name=\"Japikse&Baines\"/> In other words, power is input to compressors and output from turbines.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Turbomachinery using centrifugal compressors===\n\nA partial list of turbomachinery that may use one or more centrifugal compressors within the machine are listed here.\n\n*[[Auxiliary power unit]]\n*[[Centrifugal type supercharger]]\n*[[Gas turbine]]\n*[[Turbocharger]]\n*[[Turboprop]]\n*[[Turboshaft]]\n\n== Components of a simple centrifugal compressor ==\n\nA simple centrifugal compressor has four components: inlet, impeller/rotor, diffuser, and collector.<ref name=\"Shepard\"/> Figure 3.1 shows each of the components of the flow path, with the flow (working gas) entering the centrifugal impeller axially from right to left. As a result of the impeller rotating clockwise when looking downstream into the compressor, the flow will pass through the volute's discharge cone moving away from the figure's viewer.\n\n[[File:Turbocharger.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 3.1 \u2013 Cut-away view of a [[turbocharger]] showing the centrifugal compressor (blue) on the right end of the rotor]]\n\n=== Inlet ===\n\nThe inlet to a centrifugal compressor is typically a simple pipe. It may include features such as a valve, stationary vanes/airfoils (used to help swirl the flow) and both pressure and temperature instrumentation. All of these additional devices have important uses in the control of the centrifugal compressor.\n\n=== Centrifugal impeller ===\n\nThe key component that makes a compressor centrifugal is the centrifugal impeller, Figure 0.1, which contains a rotating set of vanes (or blades) that gradually raises the energy of the working gas. This is identical to an axial compressor with the exception that the gases can reach higher velocities and energy levels through the impeller's increasing radius. In many modern high-efficiency centrifugal compressors the gas exiting the impeller is traveling near the speed of sound.\n\nImpellers are designed in many configurations including \"open\" (visible blades), \"covered or shrouded\", \"with splitters\" (every other inducer removed) and \"w/o splitters\" (all full blades). Both Figures 0.1 and 3.1 show open impellers with splitters. Most modern high efficiency impellers use \"backsweep\" in the blade shape.<ref name=\"Japikse\">{{cite book|author=Japikse, David\n|title=Centrifugal Compressor Design and Performance\n|year=\n|publisher=Concepts ETI .\n|isbn=0-933283-03-2}}\n</ref><ref name=\"Whitfield, Baines\">{{cite book\n|author=Whitfield, A. & Baines, N.

Diffusers can be vaneless, vaned  or an alternating combination. High efficiency vaned diffusers are also designed over a wide range of solidities from less than 1 to over 4. Hybrid versions of vaned diffusers include: wedge, channel, and pipe diffusers. There are turbocharger applications that benefit by incorporating no diffuser.\n\n[[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli's fluid dynamic principle]] plays an important role in understanding diffuser performance.\n\n=== Collector ===\n\nThe collector of a centrifugal compressor can take many shapes and forms.<ref name=\"Japikse&Baines\"/><ref name=\"Aungier\"/> When the diffuser discharges into a large empty chamber, the collector may be termed a ''Plenum''. When the diffuser discharges into a device that looks somewhat like a snail shell, bull's horn or a French horn, the collector is likely to be termed a ''volute'' or ''scroll''. As the name implies, a collector\u2019s purpose is to gather the flow from the diffuser discharge annulus and deliver this flow to a downstream pipe. Either the collector or the pipe may also contain valves and instrumentation to control the compressor.\n\n== Applications ==\n\nBelow, is a partial list of centrifugal compressor applications each with a brief description of some of the general characteristics possessed by those compressors. To start this list two of the most well-known centrifugal compressor applications are listed; gas turbines and turbochargers.<ref name=\"Lakshminarayana\"/>\n\n[[File:DH Goblin annotated colour cutaway.png|thumb|300px|Figure 4.1 \u2013 [[Jet engine]] cutaway showing the centrifugal compressor and other parts.]]\n\n[[File:Turbojet operation-centrifugal flow-en.svg|thumb|300px|Figure 4.2 \u2013 [[Jet engine]] cross section showing the centrifugal compressor and other parts.]]\n\n* In [[gas turbine]]s and auxiliary power units.<ref>{{cite book|author=Saravanamuttoo, H.I.H., Rogers, G.F.C. and Cohen, H.\n|title=Gas Turbine Theory\n|year=2001\n|publisher=Prentice-Hall\n|isbn=0-13-015847-X}}\n</ref> Ref. Figures 4.1\u20134.2{{paragraph break}} In their simple form, modern gas turbines operate on the Brayton cycle. (ref Figure 5.1) Either or both axial and centrifugal compressors are used to provide compression. The types of gas turbines that most often include centrifugal compressors include turboshaft, turboprop, auxiliary power units, and micro-turbines. The industry standards applied to all of the centrifugal compressors used in aircraft applications are set by the FAA and the military to maximize both safety and durability under severe conditions. Centrifugal impellers used in gas turbines are commonly made from titanium alloy forgings. Their flow-path blades are commonly flank milled or point milled on 5-axis milling machines. When tolerances and clearances are the tightest, these designs are completed as hot operational geometry and deflected back into the cold geometry as required for manufacturing. This need arises from the impeller's deflections experienced from start-up to full speed/full temperature which can be 100 times larger than the expected hot running clearance of the impeller.\n* In automotive engine and [[diesel engine]] [[turbocharger]]s and [[supercharger]]s.<ref name=\"Baines\">\n{{cite book|author=Baines, Nicholas C.\n|title=Fundamentals of Turbocharging\n|year=2005\n|publisher= Concepts ETI .\n|isbn=0-933283-14-8}}\n</ref> Ref.

These types of plots are fundamental to understanding centrifugal compressor performance at one operating point. Studying these two plots further we see that the pressure rises between the compressor inlet (station 1) and compressor exit (station 2).  At the same time, it is easy to see that the specific volume decreases or similarly the density increases. Studying the temperature-entropy plot we see the temperature increase with increasing entropy (loss). If we assume dry air, and ideal gas equation of state and an isentropic process, we have enough information to define the pressure ratio and efficiency for this one point. Unfortunately, we are missing several other key pieces of information if we wish to apply the centrifugal compressor to another application.\n\nFigure 5.2, a centrifugal compressor performance map (either test or estimated), shows flow, pressure ratio for each of 4 speed-lines (total of 23 data points). Also included are constant efficiency contours. Centrifugal compressor performance presented in this form provides enough information to match the hardware represented by the map to a simple set of end-user requirements.\n\nCompared to estimating performance which is very cost effective (thus useful in design), testing, while costly, is still the most precise method.<ref name=\"JapikseExpTech\">\n{{cite book|author=Japikse, David\n|title=Advanced Experimental Techniques in Turbomachinery\n|year=\n|publisher= Concepts ETI\n|isbn=0-933283-01-6}}\n</ref> Further, testing centrifugal compressor performance is very complex. Professional societies such as [[ASME]] (i.e. PTC\u201310, Fluid Meters Handbook, PTC-19.x),<ref name=\"PTC10\">{{cite book|title=ASME PTC 10-1997 Test Code on Compressors and Exhausters\n|publisher=ASME \n|year=1997 \n|location=New York \n|ISBN=0-7918-2450-0\n|url=http://www.asme.org/kb/standards#des=PTC}}\n</ref> [[ASHRAE]] ([[ASHRAE Handbook]]) and [[API]] (ANSI/API 617-2002, 672-2007)<ref name=\"API617\"/><ref name=\"API672\"/> have established standards for detailed experimental methods and analysis of test results. Despite this complexity, a few basic concepts in performance can be presented by examining an example test performance map.\n\n=== Performance maps ===\n\nPressure ratio and flow are the main parameters<ref name=\"wood\"/><ref name=\"API617\"/><ref name=\"API672\"/><ref name=\"PTC10\"/> needed to match the Figure 5.2 performance map to a simple compressor application. In this case, it can be assumed that the inlet temperature is sea-level standard. Making this assumption in a real case would be a significant error. A detailed inspection of Figure 5.2 shows:\n* Corrected mass flow: 0.04 \u2013 0.34&nbsp;kg/s\n* [[Total pressure]] ratio, inlet to discharge (PR{{sub|t-t}} = P{{sub|t,discharge}}/P{{sub|t,inlet}}): 1.0 \u2013 2.6\n\nAs is standard practice, Figure 5.2 has a horizontal axis labeled with a flow parameter. While flow measurements use a wide variety unit specifications, all fit one of 2 categories:\n====Mass flow per unit time====\nMass flows, such as kg/s, are the easiest to use in practice as there is little room for confusion. Questions remaining would involve inlet or outlet (which might involve leakage from the compressor or moisture condensation). For atmospheric air, the mass flow may be wet or dry (including or excluding humidity). Often, the mass flow specification will be presented on an equivalent Mach number basis. It is standard in these cases that the equivalent temperature, equivalent pressure and gas is specified explicitly or implied at a standard condition.\n\n====Volume flow per unit time====\nIn contrast, all volume flow specifications require the additional specification of density. Bernoulli's fluid dynamic principal is of great value in understanding this problem. Confusion arises through either inaccuracies or misuse of pressure, temperature and gas constants.\n\nAlso as is standard practice, Figure 5.2 has a vertical axis labeled with a pressure parameter. The variety of pressure measurement units is also vast. In this case, they all fit one of three categories:\n* ''The delta increase or rise from inlet to exit'' (Manometer style)\n* ''The measured discharge pressure'' (force)\n* ''The force ratio'' (ratio, exit/inlet)\n\nOther features common to performance maps are:\n\n====Constant speed lines====\nThe two most common methods used for testing centrifugal compressors is to test along lines of constant shaft speed or along lines of constant throttle. If the shaft speed is held constant, test points are taken along a constant speed line by changing throttle positions. In contrast, if a throttle valve is held constant, test points are established by changing speed (common gas turbine practice). The map shown in Figure 5.2 illustrate the most common method; lines of constant speed. In this case we see data points connected via straight lines at speeds of 50%, 71%, 87%, and 100% RPM. The first three speed lines have 6 points each while the highest speed line has five.\n\n====Constant efficiency islands====\nThe next feature to be discussed is the oval shaped curves representing islands of constant efficiency. In this figure we see 11 contours ranging from 56% efficiency (decimal 0.56) to 76% efficiency (decimal 0.76). General standard practice is to interpret these efficiencies as isentropic rather than polytropic. The inclusion of efficiency islands effectively generates a 3-dimensional topology to this 2-dimensional map. With inlet density specified, it provides a further ability to calculate aerodynamic power. Lines of constant power could just as easily be substituted.\n\n====Design or guarantee point(s)====\nRegarding gas turbine operation and performance, there may be a series of guaranteed points established for the gas turbine\u2019s centrifugal compressor. These requirements are of secondary importance to the overall gas turbine performance as a whole. For this reason it is only necessary to summarize that in the ideal case, the lowest specific fuel consumption would occur when the centrifugal compressors peak efficiency curve coincides with the gas turbine's required operation line.\n\nIn contrast to gas turbines, most other applications (including industrial) need to meet a less stringent set of performance requirements. Historically, centrifugal compressors applied to industrial applications were needed to achieve performance at a specific flow and pressure. Modern industrial compressors are often needed to achieve specific performance goals across a range of flows and pressures; thus taking a significant step toward the sophistication seen in gas turbine applications.\n\nIf the compressor represented by Figure 5.2 is used in a simple application, any point (pressure and flow) within the 76% efficiency would provide very acceptable performance. An \"End User\" would be very happy with the performance requirements of 2.0 pressure ratio at 0.21&nbsp;kg/s.\n\n=== Surge ===\n\nSurge - is the point at which the compressor cannot add enough energy to overcome the system resistance or backpressure.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |author=Pampreen, Ronald C.\n |title=Compressor Surge and Stall\n |edition=\n |publisher=Concepts ETI\n |year=1993\n |isbn=0-933283-05-9\n}}</ref> This causes a rapid flow reversal (i.e., surge). As a result, high vibration, temperature increases, and rapid changes in axial thrust can occur. These occurrences can damage the rotor seals, rotor bearings, the compressor driver and cycle operation. Most turbomachines are designed to easily withstand occasional surging. However, if the machine is forced to surge repeatedly for a long period of time, or if it is poorly designed, repeated surges can result in a catastrophic failure. Of particular interest, is that while turbomachines may be very durable, the cycles/processes that they are used within can be far less robust.\n\n====Surge line====\nThe surge-line shown in Figure 5.2 is the curve that passes through the lowest flow points of each of the four speed lines. As a test map, these points would be the lowest flow points possible to record a stable reading within the test facility/rig. In many industrial applications it may be necessary to increase the stall line due to the system backpressure. For example, at 100% RPM stalling flow might increase from approximately 0.170&nbsp;kg/s to 0.215&nbsp;kg/s because of the positive slope of the pressure ratio curve.\n\nAs stated earlier, the reason for this is that the high-speed line in Figure 5.2 exhibits a stalling characteristic or positive slope within that range of flows. When placed in a different system those lower flows might not be achievable because of interaction with that system. System resistance or adverse pressure is proven mathematically to be the critical contributor to compressor surge.\n\n=== Maximum flow line versus choke ===\n\nChoke occurs under one of 2 conditions. Typically for high speed equipment, as flow increases the velocity of the flow can approach sonic speed somewhere within the compressor stage. This location may occur at the impeller inlet \"throat\" or at the vaned diffuser inlet \"throat\". In contrast, for lower speed equipment, as flows increase, losses increase such that the pressure ratio eventually drops to 1:1. In this case, the occurrence of choke is unlikely.\n\nThe speed lines of gas turbine centrifugal compressors typically exhibit choke. This is a situation where the pressure ratio of a speed line drops rapidly (vertically) with little or no change in flow. In most cases the reason for this is that close to Mach 1 velocities have been reached somewhere within the impeller and/or diffuser generating a rapid increase in losses. Higher pressure ratio turbocharger centrifugal compressors exhibit this same phenomenon. Real choke phenomena is a function of compressibility as measured by the local Mach number within an area restriction within the centrifugal pressure stage.\n\nThe maximum flow line, shown in Figure 5.2, is the curve that passes through the highest flow points of each speed line. Upon inspection it may be noticed that each of these points has been taken near 56% efficiency. Selecting a low efficiency (<60%) is the most common practice used to  terminate compressor performance maps at high flows. Another factor that is used to establish the maximum flow line is a pressure ratio near or equal to 1. The 50% speed line may be considered an example of this.\n\nThe shape of Figure 5.2's speed lines provides a good example of why it is inappropriate to use the term choke in association with a maximum flow of all centrifugal compressor speed lines. In summary; most industrial and commercial centrifugal compressors are selected or designed to operate at or near their highest efficiencies and to avoid operation at low efficiencies. For this reason there is seldom a reason to illustrate centrifugal compressor performance below 60% efficiency.\n\nMany industrial and commercial multistage compressor performance maps exhibits this same vertical characteristic for a different reason related to what is known as stage stacking.\n\n=== Other operating limits ===\n\n;Minimum operating speed: The minimum speed for acceptable operation, below this value the compressor may be controlled to stop or go into an \"Idle\" condition.\n;Maximum allowable speed: The maximum operating speed for the compressor. Beyond this value stresses may rise above prescribed limits and rotor vibrations may increase rapidly. At speeds above this level the equipment will likely become very dangerous and be controlled to lower speeds.\n\n==Dimensional analysis==\n\n{{details|Buckingham \u03c0 theorem}}\n\nTo weigh the advantages between centrifugal compressors it is important to compare 8 parameters classic to turbomachinery. Specifically, pressure rise (p), flow (Q), angular speed (N), power (P), density (\u03c1), diameter (D), viscosity (\u03bc) and elasticity (e). This creates a practical problem when trying to experimentally determine the effect of any one parameter. This is because it is nearly impossible to change one of these parameters independently.\n\nThe method of procedure known as the Buckingham \u03c0 theorem can help solve this problem by generating 5 dimensionless forms of these parameters.<ref name=\"Shepard\"/><ref name=\"Japikse&Baines\"/><ref name=\"streeter\">{{cite book|last=Streeter|first=Victor L.|title=Fluid Mechanics fifth edition|year=1971|publisher=McGraw Hill Book Company|location=New York|isbn=0-07-062191-8}}</ref> These Pi parameters provide the foundation for \"similitude\"  and the \"affinity-laws\" in turbomachinery. They provide for the creation of  additional relationships (being dimensionless) found valuable in the characterization of performance.\n\nFor the examples below Head will be substituted for pressure and sonic velocity will be substituted for elasticity.\n\n=== \u03a0 theorem ===\n\nThe three independent dimensions used in this procedure for turbomachinery are:\n*'''<math>M</math>''' mass (force is an alternative)\n*'''<math>L</math>''' length\n*'''<math>T</math>''' time\n\nAccording to the theorem each of the eight main parameters are equated to its independent dimensions as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Flow\n| <math> Q = </math>\n| <math> \\frac{L^3}{T}</math>\n| ex. = m{{sup|3}}/s\n|-\n| Head\n| <math> H = </math>\n| <math> \\frac{M L}{T^2}</math>\n| ex. = kg\u00b7m/s{{sup|2}}\n|-\n| Speed\n| <math> U = </math>\n| <math> \\frac{L}{T}</math>\n| ex. = m/s\n|-\n| Power\n| <math> P = </math>\n| <math> \\frac{M L^2}{T^3}</math>\n| ex. = kg\u00b7m{{sup|2}}/s{{sup|3}}\n|-\n| Density\n| <math> \\rho = </math>\n| <math> \\frac{M}{L^3}</math>\n| ex. = kg/m{{sup|3}}\n|-\n| Viscosity\n| <math> \\mu = </math>\n| <math> \\frac{M}{L T}</math>\n| ex. = kg/m\u00b7s\n|-\n| Diameter\n| <math> D = </math>\n| <math> L</math>\n| ex. = m\n|-\n| Speed of sound\n| <math> a = </math>\n| <math> \\frac{L}{T}</math>\n| ex. = m/s\n|}\n\n=== Classic turbomachinery similitude ===\n\nCompleting the task of following the formal procedure results in generating this classic set of five dimensionless parameters for turbomachinery. Full similitude is achieved when each of the 5 Pi-parameters are equivalent.  This of course would mean the two turbomachines being compared are geometrically similar and running at the same operating point.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Flow coefficient\n| <math> \\Pi_1 = </math>\n| <math> \\frac{Q}{N D^3}</math>\n|-\n| Head coefficient\n| <math> \\Pi_2 = </math>\n| <math> \\frac{g H}{N^2 D^2}</math>\n|-\n| Speed coefficient\n| <math> \\Pi_4 = </math>\n| <math> \\frac{N D}{a}</math>\n|-\n| Power coefficient\n| <math> \\Pi_3 = </math>\n| <math> \\frac{P}{\\rho N^3 D^5}</math>\n|-\n| Reynolds coefficient\n| <math> \\Pi_5 = </math>\n| <math> \\frac{\\rho N D^2}{\\mu}</math>\n|}\n\nTurbomachinery analysts gain tremendous insight into performance by comparisons of these 5 parameters with efficiencies and loss coefficients which are also dimensionless. In general application, the flow coefficient and head coefficient are considered of primary importance. Generally, for centrifugal compressors, the velocity coefficient is of secondary importance while the Reynolds coefficient is of tertiary importance. In contrast, as expected for pumps, the Reynolds number becomes of secondary importance and the velocity coefficient almost irrelevant. It may be found interesting that the speed coefficient may be chosen to define the y-axis of Figure 1.1, while at the same time the Reynolds coefficient may be chosen to define the z-axis.\n\n=== Other dimensionless combinations ===\n\nDemonstrated in the table below is another value of dimensional analysis.  Any number of new dimensionless parameters can be calculated through exponents and multiplication.  For example, a variation of the first parameter shown below is popularly used in  aircraft engine system analysis. The third parameter is a simplified dimensional variation of the first and second.  This third definition is applicable with strict limitations. The fourth parameter, specific speed, is very well known and useful in that it removes diameter.  The fifth parameter, specific diameter, is a less often discussed dimensionless parameter found useful by Balje.<ref>{{cite book|last=Balje|first=O.

They provide a simple basis for scaling turbomachinery from one application to the next.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| From flow coefficient\n| <math> \\frac{Q_1}{Q_2} = </math>\n| <math> \\frac{N_1}{N_2} = </math>\n| <math> \\left(\\frac{D_1}{D_2}\\right)^3</math>\n|-\n| From head coefficient\n| <math> \\frac{H_1}{H_2} = </math>\n| <math> \\left(\\frac{N_1}{N_2}\\right)^2 = </math>\n| <math> \\left(\\frac{D_1}{D_2}\\right)^2</math>\n|-\n| From power coefficient\n| <math> \\frac{P_1}{P_2} =  </math>\n| <math> \\left(\\frac{N_1}{N_2}\\right)^3 =</math>\n| <math> \\left(\\frac{D_1}{D_2}\\right)^5</math>\n|}\n\n== Aero-thermodynamic fundamentals ==\n\nThe following equations outline a fully three-dimensional mathematical problem that is very difficult to solve even with simplifying assumptions.<ref name=\"Lakshminarayana\"/><ref>\n{{cite book\n|author=Cumpsty, N. A.\n|title=Compressor Aerodynamics\n|year=2004\n|publisher=Krieger Publishing\n|isbn=1-57524-247-8}}\n</ref> Until recently, limitations in computational power, forced these equations to be simplified to an Inviscid two-dimensional problem with pseudo losses. Before the advent of computers, these equations were almost always simplified to a one-dimensional problem.\n\nSolving this one-dimensional problem is still valuable today and is often termed ''mean-line analysis''. Even with all of this simplification it still requires large textbooks to outline and large computer programs to solve practically.\n\n=== Conservation of mass ===\nAlso termed ''continuity'', this fundamental equation written in general form is as follows:\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{v}) = 0</math>\n\n=== Conservation of momentum ===\nAlso termed the ''[[Navier\u2013Stokes equation]]s'', this fundamental is derivable from [[Newton's second law]]  when applied to [[Fluid dynamics|fluid motion]]. Written in compressible form for a Newtonian fluid, this equation may be written as follows:\n:<math>\\rho \\left(\\frac{\\partial  \\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathbf{v}\\right) = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v} + \\left( \\tfrac13 \\mu + \\mu^v) \\nabla (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\right) + \\mathbf{f} </math>\n\n=== Conservation of energy ===\nThe [[First Law of Thermodynamics]] is the statement of the conservation of energy. Under specific conditions, the operation of a Centrifugal compressor is considered a reversible process. For a reversible process, the total amount of heat added to a system can be expressed as <math>\\delta Q=TdS</math> where <math>T</math> is [[temperature]] and <math>S</math> is [[entropy]]. Therefore, for a reversible process:\n:<math>dU=TdS-pdV.\\,</math>\n\nSince U, S and V are thermodynamic functions of state, the above relation holds also for non-reversible changes. The above equation is known as the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]].\n\n=== Equation of state ===\nThe classical [[ideal gas law]] may be written:\n:<math>{\\ pV = nRT}.</math>\n\nThe ideal gas law may also be expressed as follows\n:<math>{\\ p = \\rho (\\gamma-1)U}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the density, <math>\\gamma = C_p/C_v</math> is the adiabatic index ([[Heat capacity ratio|ratio of specific heats]]), <math>U = C_vT</math> is the internal energy per unit mass (the \"specific internal energy\"), <math>C_v</math> is the specific heat at constant volume, and <math>C_p</math> is the specific heat at constant pressure.\n\nWith regard to the equation of state, it is important to remember that while air and nitrogen properties (near standard atmospheric conditions) are easily and accurately estimated by this simple relationship, there are many centrifugal compressor applications where the ideal relationship is inadequate. For example, centrifugal compressors used for large air conditioning systems (water chillers) use a refrigerant as a working gas that cannot be modeled as an ideal gas. Another example are centrifugal compressors design and built for the petroleum industry. Most of the hydrocarbon gases such as methane and ethylene are best modeled as a [[real gas]] [[equation of state]] rather than ideal gases. The Wikipedia entry for equations of state is very thorough.\n\n== Pros and cons ==\n\n* ''Pros''\n::Centrifugal compressors are used throughout industry because they have fewer rubbing parts, are relatively energy efficient, and give higher airflow than a similarly sized [[reciprocating compressor]]  or positive-displacement compressor.\n\n* ''Cons''\n::Their main drawback is that they cannot achieve the high [[compression ratio]] of reciprocating compressors without multiple stages. There are few one-stage centrifugal compressors capable of pressure ratios over 10:1, due to stress considerations which severely limit the compressor's safety, durability and life expectancy.\n\n* ''Pros''\n::Centrifugal compressors are often used in small [[gas turbine]] engines like APUs (auxiliary power units) and smaller aircraft gas turbines. A significant reason for this is that with current technology, the equivalent flow [[axial compressor]] will be less efficient due primarily to a combination of rotor and variable stator tip-clearance losses. Further, they offer the advantages of simplicity of manufacturing and relatively low cost. This is due to requiring fewer stages to achieve the same pressure rise.\n\n* ''Cons''\n::Centrifugal compressors are impractical, compared to axial compressors, for use in large [[gas turbine]] engines propelling large aircraft, due to the resulting weight and stress, and to the frontal area presented by the diffuser.\n\n== Structural mechanics, manufacture and design compromise ==\n\nIdeally, centrifugal compressor impellers have thin airfoil blades that are strong, each mounted on a light rotor. This material would be easy to machine or cast and inexpensive. Additionally, it would generate no operating noise, have an life while operating in any environment.{{Clarify|reason=garbled|date=September 2016}}\n\nFrom the very start of the aero-thermodynamic design process,the aerodynamic considerations and optimizations [29,30] are critical to have a successful design.  during the design, the centrifugal impeller's material and manufacturing method must be accounted for within the design, whether it be plastic for a vacuum cleaner blower, aluminum alloy for a turbocharger, steel alloy for an air compressor or titanium alloy for a gas turbine. It is a combination of the centrifugal compressor impeller shape, its operating environment, its material and its manufacturing method that determines the impeller's structural integrity.\n\n==See also==\n{{multicol}}\n*[[Angular momentum]]\n*[[Centrifugal force]]\n*[[Centripetal force]]\n*[[Coand\u0103 effect]]\n*[[Computational fluid dynamics]]\n*[[Compressibility]]\n*[[Coriolis effect]]\n*[[Corrected speed]]\n*[[Darcy\u2013Weisbach equation]]\n*[[Gustaf de Laval]]\n*[[Enthalpy]]\n*[[Entropy]]\n*[[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)]]\n*[[Finite element analysis]]\n*[[Fluid dynamics]]\n{{multicol-break}}\n*[[Gas laws]]\n*[[Ideal gas law]]\n*[[Kinematics]]\n*[[Real gas]]\n*[[Rossby number]]\n*[[Mach number]]\n*[[Multiphase flow]]\n*[[Navier-Stokes equations]]\n*[[Reynolds-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]\n*[[Reynolds transport theorem]]\n*[[Reynolds number]]\n*[[Turbulence]]\n*[[Viscosity]]\n*[[Von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics (VKI)]]\n{{multicol-end}}\n* [[Three-dimensional losses and correlation in turbomachinery]]\n*[[Effects of mach number and shock losses in turbomachines]]\n\n<ref name=xu_and_Aman>Xu, C. and R.S.
