They also make up most of the oceans and atmosphere. However, the majority of familiar solid substances on Earth, including most of the minerals that make up the [[Crust (geology)|crust]], [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], and [[Earth core|core of the Earth]], contain many chemical bonds, but are ''not'' made of identifiable molecules. Also, no typical molecule can be defined for [[ionic crystal]]s ([[salt (chemistry)|salts]]) and covalent crystals ([[network solid]]s), although these are often composed of repeating [[unit cell]]s that extend either in a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] (such as in [[graphene]]) or three-dimensionally (such as in [[diamond]], [[quartz]], or [[sodium chloride]]). The theme of repeated unit-cellular-structure also holds for most condensed phases with [[metallic bond]]ing, which means that solid metals are also not made of molecules. In [[glass]]es (solids that exist in a vitreous disordered state), atoms may also be held together by chemical bonds with no presence of any definable molecule, nor any of the regularity of repeating units that characterizes crystals.\n\n== Molecular science ==\n\nThe science of molecules is called ''molecular chemistry'' or ''[[molecular physics]]'', depending on whether the focus is on chemistry or physics. Molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of [[chemical bond]]s, while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties. In practice, however, this distinction is vague. In molecular sciences, a molecule consists of a stable system ([[bound state]]) composed of two or more [[atom]]s. [[Polyatomic ion]]s may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules. The term ''unstable molecule'' is used for very [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] species, i.e., short-lived assemblies ([[Resonance (chemistry)|resonances]]) of electrons and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], such as [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]], molecular [[ion]]s, [[Rydberg molecule]]s, [[transition state]]s, [[van der Waals bonding|van der Waals complexes]], or systems of colliding atoms as in [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]].\n{{clear}}\n\n== History and etymology ==\n{{Main|History of molecular theory}}\n\nAccording to [[Merriam-Webster]] and the [[Online Etymology Dictionary]], the word \"molecule\" derives from the [[Latin]] \"[[Mole (unit)|moles]]\" or small unit of mass.\n* '''Molecule''' (1794)&nbsp;\u2013 \"extremely minute particle\", from French ''{{linktext|mol\u00e9cule}}'' (1678), from [[New Latin]] ''{{linktext|molecula}}'', diminutive of Latin ''{{linktext|moles}}'' \"mass, barrier\". A vague meaning at first; the vogue for the word (used until the late 18th century only in Latin form) can be traced to the philosophy of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]].<ref>{{OEtymD|molecule|accessdate=2016-02-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=molecule|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/molecule|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe definition of the molecule has evolved as knowledge of the structure of molecules has increased. Earlier definitions were less precise, defining molecules as the smallest [[list of particles#Molecules|particles]] of pure [[chemical substance]]s that still retain their [[chemical compound|composition]] and chemical properties.<ref>[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/glossary/m.shtml#molecule Molecule Definition] ([[Frostburg State University]])</ref> This definition often breaks down since many substances in ordinary experience, such as [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], and [[metal]]s, are composed of large crystalline networks of [[chemical bond|chemically bonded]] atoms or [[ion]]s, but are not made of discrete molecules.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Bonding ==\n\nMolecules are held together by either [[covalent bonding]] or [[ionic bonding]]. Several types of non-metal elements exist only as molecules in the environment. For example, hydrogen only exists as hydrogen molecule. A molecule of a compound is made out of two or more elements.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Hutchinson unabridged encyclopedia with atlas and weather guide|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/hutchinson-unabridged-encyclopedia-with-atlas-and-weather-guide/oclc/696918830|website=worldcat.org|publisher=Oxford, England|accessdate=28 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Covalent ===\n{{main|Covalent bonding}}\n[[File:Covalent bond hydrogen.svg|thumb|right|A covalent bond forming H<sub>2</sub> (right) where two [[hydrogen atom]]s share the two electrons]]\nA covalent bond is a [[chemical bond]] that involves the sharing of [[electron pair]]s between [[atom]]s.

The ions are atoms that have lost one or more [[electron]]s (termed [[cation]]s) and atoms that have gained one or more electrons (termed [[anion]]s). This transfer of electrons is termed ''electrovalence'' in contrast to [[covalent bond|covalence]]. In the simplest case, the cation is a [[metal]] atom and the anion is a [[nonmetal]] atom, but these ions can be of a more complex nature, e.g. molecular ions like NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> or SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>. In simpler words, an ionic bond is the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal for both atoms to obtain a full valence shell.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Molecular size ==\n\n[[File:Polyvinylidene fluoride nanofiber.jpg|thumb|right|Arrangement of [[polyvinylidene fluoride]] molecules in a [[nanofiber]]{{snds}}[[transmission electron microscopy]] image.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/C5NR01619C |title=Polyvinylidene fluoride molecules in nanofibers, imaged at atomic scale by aberration corrected electron microscopy |journal=Nanoscale |year=2015 |last1=Lolla |first1=Dinesh |last2=Gorse |first2=Joseph |last3=Kisielowski |first3=Christian |last4=Miao |first4=Jiayuan |last5=Taylor |first5=Philip L. |last6=Chase |first6=George G. |last7=Reneker |first7=Darrell H. |bibcode= 2015Nanos...8..120L}}</ref>]]\n\nMost molecules are far too small to be seen with the naked eye, but there are exceptions.

These are limited to one typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts.\n\nA compound's [[empirical formula]] is a very simple type of chemical formula. It is the simplest [[integer]] [[ratio]] of the [[chemical element]]s that constitute it. For example, water is always composed of a 2:1 ratio of [[hydrogen]] to [[oxygen]] atoms, and ethyl [[alcohol]] or [[ethanol]] is always composed of [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], and [[oxygen]] in a 2:6:1 ratio. However, this does not determine the kind of molecule uniquely&nbsp;\u2013 [[dimethyl ether]] has the same ratios as ethanol, for instance. Molecules with the same [[atom]]s in different arrangements are called [[isomer]]s. Also carbohydrates, for example, have the same ratio (carbon:hydrogen:oxygen= 1:2:1) (and thus the same empirical formula) but different total numbers of atoms in the molecule.\n\nThe [[molecular formula]] reflects the exact number of atoms that compose the molecule and so characterizes different molecules. However different isomers can have the same atomic composition while being different molecules.\n\nThe empirical formula is often the same as the molecular formula but not always. For example, the molecule [[acetylene]] has molecular formula C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, but the simplest integer ratio of elements is CH.\n\nThe [[molecular mass]] can be calculated from the [[chemical formula]] and is expressed in conventional [[atomic mass unit]]s equal to 1/12 of the mass of a neutral carbon-12 (<sup>12</sup>[[carbon|C]] [[isotope]]) atom. For [[network solid]]s, the term [[formula unit]] is used in [[stoichiometric]] calculations.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Structural formula ===\n{{Main|Structural formula}}\n\n[[File:Atisane3.png|thumb|right|400px|[[Three-dimensional space|3D]] (left and center) and [[2D geometric model|2D]] (right) representations of the [[terpenoid]] molecule atisane]]\n\nFor molecules with a complex 3-dimensional structure, especially involving atoms bonded to four different substituents, a simple molecular formula or even semi-structural [[chemical formula]] may not be enough to completely specify the molecule. In this case, a graphical type of formula called a [[structural formula]] may be needed. Structural formulas may in turn be represented with a one-dimensional chemical name, but such [[chemical nomenclature]] requires many words and terms which are not part of chemical formulas.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Molecular geometry ==\n{{Main|Molecular geometry}}\n\n[[File:Cyanostar STM.png|thumb|upright=.5|right|Structure and [[Scanning tunneling microscopy|STM]] image of a \"cyanostar\" [[dendrimer]] molecule.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/C4CC03725A|pmid=25080328|title=Anion-induced dimerization of 5-fold symmetric cyanostars in 3D crystalline solids and 2D self-assembled crystals|journal=Chemical Communications|volume=50|issue=69|page=9827|year=2014|last1=Hirsch|first1=Brandon E.|last2=Lee|first2=Semin|last3=Qiao|first3=Bo|last4=Chen|first4=Chun-Hsing|last5=McDonald|first5=Kevin P.|last6=Tait|first6=Steven L.|last7=Flood|first7=Amar H.}}</ref>]]\n\nMolecules have fixed [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] geometries\u2014bond lengths and angles\u2014 about which they continuously oscillate through vibrational and rotational motions. A pure substance is composed of molecules with the same average geometrical structure. The chemical formula and the structure of a molecule are the two important factors that determine its properties, particularly its [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]. [[Isomers]] share a chemical formula but normally have very different properties because of their different structures. [[Stereoisomer]]s, a particular type of isomer, may have very similar physico-chemical properties and at the same time different [[biochemistry|biochemical]] activities.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Molecular spectroscopy ==\n{{Main|Spectroscopy}}\n\n[[File:Dehydrogenation of H2TPP by STM.jpg|thumb|right|Hydrogen can be removed from individual [[Tetraphenylporphyrin|H<sub>2</sub>TPP]] molecules by applying excess voltage to the tip of a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM, a); this removal alters the current-voltage (I-V) curves of TPP molecules, measured using the same STM tip, from [[diode]] like (red curve in b) to [[resistor]] like (green curve).

[[Infrared spectroscopy]] measures changes in vibration of molecules, including stretching, bending or twisting motions. It is commonly used to identify the kinds of bonds or [[functional group]]s in molecules. Changes in the arrangements of electrons yield absorption or emission lines in ultraviolet, visible or [[near infrared]] light, and result in colour. Nuclear resonance spectroscopy actually measures the environment of particular nuclei in the molecule, and can be used to characterise the numbers of atoms in different positions in a molecule.\n\n== Theoretical aspects ==\n\nThe study of molecules by [[molecular physics]] and [[theoretical chemistry]] is largely based on [[quantum mechanic]]s and is essential for the understanding of the [[chemical bond]]. The simplest of molecules is the [[hydrogen molecule-ion]], H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the [[one-electron bond]]. H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> is composed of two positively charged [[proton]]s and one negatively charged [[electron]], which means that the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron\u2013electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complex molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of [[computational chemistry]].\n\nWhen trying to define rigorously whether an arrangement of atoms is ''sufficiently stable'' to be considered a molecule, IUPAC suggests that it \"must correspond to a depression on the [[potential energy surface]] that is deep enough to confine at least one vibrational state\".<ref name=\"iupac\" /> This definition does not depend on the nature of the interaction between the atoms, but only on the strength of the interaction. In fact, it includes weakly bound species that would not traditionally be considered molecules, such as the [[helium]] [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]], [[helium dimer|He<sub>2</sub>]], which has one vibrational [[bound state]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Anderson JB |title=Comment on \"An exact quantum Monte Carlo calculation of the helium-helium intermolecular potential\" [J.

Philosophically, therefore, a molecule is not a fundamental entity (in contrast, for instance, to an [[elementary particle]]); rather, the concept of a molecule is the chemist's way of making a useful statement about the strengths of atomic-scale interactions in the world that we observe.\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=23em}}\n* [[Atom]]\n* [[Chemical polarity]]\n* [[Covalent bond]]\n* [[Diatomic molecule]]\n* [[List of compounds]]\n* [[List of interstellar and circumstellar molecules]]\n* [[Molecular design software]]\n* [[Molecular engineering]]\n* [[Molecular geometry]]\n* [[Molecular Hamiltonian]]\n* [[Molecular ion]]\n* [[Molecular modelling]]\n* [[Molecular orbital]]\n* [[Non-covalent bonding]]\n* [[Periodic systems of small molecules]]\n* [[Small molecule]]\n* [[Comparison of software for molecular mechanics modeling]]\n* [[Van der Waals molecule]]\n* [[World Wide Molecular Matrix]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Chemistry|Molecular and cell biology|Physics}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikimedia|collapsible=true|c=Category:Molecules|voy=no|wikt=molecule|v=no|n=no|q=Molecule|s=no|b=no|species=no|d=Q11369}}\n\n* [http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/motm.htm Molecule of the Month{{snds}}School of Chemistry, University of Bristol]\n\n{{Composition}}\n{{Molecules detected in outer space}}\n{{Particles}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Molecular physics| ]]\n[[Category:Molecules| ]]\n[[Category:Chemistry]]\n[[Category:Matter]]"}]}}}}
