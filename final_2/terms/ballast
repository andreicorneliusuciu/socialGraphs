Ballast, other than [[cargo]], may be placed in a vehicle, often a [[ship]] or the gondola of a [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] or [[airship]], to provide [[Ship stability|stability]]. A compartment within a boat, ship, [[submarine]], or other floating structure that holds water is called a [[ballast tank]]. Water should move in and out from the ballast tank to balance the ship.  In a vessel that travels on the water, the ballast will remain below the water level, to counteract the effects of weight above the water level.<ref>Edward Spon, Oliver Byrne, Ernest Spon, Francis N. Spon, ''Spons' dictionary of engineering, civil, mechanical, military, and Naval, Volume 2'' (1874), p. 1205.</ref> The ballast may be redistributed in the vessel or disposed of altogether to change its effects on the movement of the vessel.\n\n==History==\nThe basic concept behind the ballast tank can be seen in many forms of aquatic life, such as the [[blowfish]] or members of the [[Argonaut (animal)|argonaut]] group of [[octopus]].<ref>[http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/05/18/the-argonaut-%E2%80%93-an-octopus-that-creates-its-own-ballast-tank/ Discovery Blog: Scientists solve millennia-old mystery about the argonaut octopus]</ref> The concept has been invented and reinvented many times by humans to serve a variety of purposes.\nIn the nineteenth century, cargo boats returning from Europe to North America would carry quarried stone as ballast, contributing to the architectural heritage of some east coast cities (for example Montreal), where this stone was used in building.\n\n==Uses==\n[[Image:Yacht keel.svg|thumb|One of the functions of a yacht's keel is to provide ballast.]]\nBallast takes many forms. The simplest form of ballast used in small [[day sailer]]s is so-called \"live ballast\", or the weight of the crew. By sitting on the [[windward]] side of the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]], the heeling moment must lift the weight of the crew. On more advanced racing boats, a wire harness called a [[trapeze (sailing)|trapeze]] is used to allow the crew to hang completely over the side of the hull without falling out; this provides much larger amounts of righting moment due to the larger [[lever]]age of the crew's weight, but can be dangerous if the wind suddenly dies, as the sudden loss of heeling moment can dump the crew in the water. On larger modern vessels, the [[keel]] is made of or filled with a high [[density]] material, such as [[concrete]], [[iron]], or [[lead]]. By placing the weight as low as possible (often in a large bulb at the bottom of the keel) the maximum righting moment can be extracted from the given mass. Traditional forms of ballast carried inside the hull were stones or sand.\n\n[[Sailing ballast]] is used in [[sailboats]] to provide [[moment (physics)|moment]] to resist the lateral forces on the [[sail]]. Insufficiently ballasted boats will tend to tip, or heel, excessively in high winds.  Too much heel may result in the boat [[Capsize|capsizing]]. If a sailing vessel should need to voyage without cargo then ballast of little or no value would be loaded to keep the vessel upright. Some or all of this ballast would then be discarded when cargo was loaded.\n\n[[Ballast weight]] is also added to a [[race car]] to alter its performance. In most racing series, cars have a minimum allowable weight. Often, the actual weight of the car is lower, so ballast is used to bring it up to the minimum. The advantage is that the ballast can be positioned to affect the car's handling by changing its [[load distribution]]. This is near-universal in [[Formula 1]]. It is also common in other racing series that ballast may only be located in certain positions on the car. In some racing series, for example the [[British Touring Car Championship]], ballast is used as a handicap, the leading drivers at the end of one race being given more ballast for the next race.\n\nBallast may also be carried aboard an aircraft. For example, in [[Gliding#Maximizing average speed|gliding]] it may be used to increase speed and/or adjust the aircraft's center of gravity, or in a balloon as a [[Buoyancy compensator (aviation)|buoyancy compensator]].\n\n==Ballast in commercial shipping==\nIf a cargo vessel (such as a tanker, bulk carrier or container ship) wishes to travel empty or partially empty to collect a cargo, it must travel ''in ballast''.  This keeps the vessel in trim, and keeps the propeller and rudder submerged.  Typically, being \"in ballast\" will mean flooding the ballast tanks with sea water.  Serious problems arise [[Ballast water discharge and the environment|when the ballast water is discharged]], as water-borne organisms may create havoc when deposited in new environments.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Mechanisms (engineering)]]\n[[Category:Watercraft components]]"}]}}}}
