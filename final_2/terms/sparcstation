The series was very popular and introduced the Sun-4c architecture, a variant of the [[Sun-4]] architecture previously introduced in the Sun 4/260. Thanks in part to the delay in the development of more modern processors from [[Motorola]], the SPARCstation series was very successful across the entire industry. The last model bearing the SPARCstation name was the SPARCstation 20. The workstation series was replaced by the [[Sun Ultra series]] in 1995; the next Sun server generation was the [[Sun Enterprise]] line introduced in 1996.\n\n== Models ==\nDesktop and deskside SPARCstations and SPARCservers of the same model number were essentially identical systems, the only difference being that systems designated as servers were usually \"headless\" (that is, configured without a [[graphics card]] and monitor), and were sold with a \"server\" rather than a \"desktop\" OS license. For example, the SPARCstation 20 and SPARCserver 20 were almost identical in [[motherboard]], [[Central processing unit|CPU]], case design and most other [[computer hardware|hardware]] specifications.\n\nMost desktop SPARCstations and SPARCservers shipped in either \"[[pizza box form factor|pizzabox]]\" or \"[[Small form factor#Lunch Box|lunchbox]]\" enclosures, a significant departure from earlier Sun and competing systems of the time. The SPARCstation 1, 2, 4, 5, 10 and 20 were \"pizzabox\" machines. The SPARCstation SLC and ELC were integrated into Sun [[monochrome monitor]] enclosures, and the SPARCstation IPC, IPX, SPARCclassic, SPARCclassic X and SPARCstation LX were \"lunchbox\" machines.\n[[File:SS1000-ssa.jpg|thumb|SPARCserver 1000 and SPARC Storage Array disk array]]\nSPARCserver models ending in \"30\" or \"70\" were housed in deskside pedestal enclosures (respectively 5-slot and 12-slot [[VMEbus]] chassis); models ending in \"90\" and the SPARCcenter 2000 came in rackmount cabinet enclosures. The SPARCserver 1000's form-factor was a large rack-mountable desktop unit.\n\nLater versions of the SPARCstation series, such as the [[SPARCstation 10]] and 20, could be configured as [[multiprocessing|multiprocessor]] systems as they were based on the [[MBus (SPARC)|MBus]] high-speed bus. These systems could accept one or two single or dual [[central processing unit]]s packaged in MBus modules.\n\nUntil the launch of the SPARCserver 600MP series, all SPARCstation/server models were also assigned Sun 4-series model numbers. Later models received S-prefix model numbers.\n\nModels are listed within their category in approximately chronological order.\n\n=== \"Pizzabox\" systems ===\n{| width=\"100%\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Model\n!Codename\n!Platform\n!CPU\n!CPU MHz\n!RAM (max)\n!Announced\n!End of Sales\n!End of Support\n|-\n|'''[[SPARCstation 1]]'''\n|4/60\n|Campus\n|sun4c\n|Fujitsu MB86901A or LSI L64801\n|20&nbsp;MHz\n|64 MB\n|1989\n|\n|May 1999\n|-\n|'''[[SPARCstation 1 | SPARCstation 1+]]'''\n|4/65\n|Campus B\n|sun4c\n|LSI L64801\n|25&nbsp;MHz\n|64 MB\n|1989\n|\n|May 1999\n|-\n|'''[[SPARCstation 2]]'''\n|4/75\n|Calvin\n|sun4c\n|Cypress CY7C601\n|40&nbsp;MHz\n|128 MB\n|1990\n|\n|Dec 1999\n|-\n|'''[[SPARCstation 10]]'''\n|S10\n|Campus-2\n|sun4m\n|SuperSPARC I/II or [[hyperSPARC]]\n|33, 36, 40, 50, 60, 75, 80, 90, 100, 125, 150, 180, 200&nbsp;MHz\n|512 MB\n|May 1992\n|Oct 1994\n|Oct 1999\n|-\n|'''[[SPARCstation 5]]'''\n|S5\n|Aurora\n|sun4m\n|microSPARC II or [[TurboSPARC]]\n|70, 85, 110, 170&nbsp;MHz\n|256 MB\n|1994\n|\n|Dec 1998\n|-\n|'''[[SPARCstation 20]]'''\n|S20\n|Kodiak\n|sun4m\n|SuperSPARC I/II or hyperSPARC\n|50, 60, 75, 90, 100, 125, 150, 180, 200&nbsp;MHz\n|512 MB\n|1994\n|\n|Sep 1997\n|-\n|'''[[SPARCstation 4]]'''\n|S4\n|Perigee\n|sun4m\n|microSPARC II\n|70, 85, 110&nbsp;MHz\n|160 MB\n|1995\n|\n|Jul 1997\n|-\n|'''[[SPARC Xterminal 1]]''' {{r|group=Note|ref1}}\n|S114\n|Perigee\n|sun4m\n|microSPARC\n|50&nbsp;MHz\n|128 MB\n|March 1995\n|\n|\n|}\n\n{{reflist|group=Note|refs=\n<ref name=ref1>The SPARC Xterminal 1 was an [[X terminal]], using the same enclosure as the SPARCstation 4, but a different motherboard.
