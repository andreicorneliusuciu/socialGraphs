[[Wernher von Braun]] and over 100 key V-2 personnel surrendered to the Americans. Through a lengthy [[Operation Paperclip|sequence of events]], a significant portion of the original V-2 team ended up working for the [[US Army]] at the [[Redstone Arsenal]]. The US also captured enough V-2 hardware to build approximately 80 of the missiles. The Soviets gained possession of the V-2 manufacturing facilities after the war and proceeded to re-establish V-2 production and move it to the Soviet Union.\n\nIn October 1958, the Redstone team led by von Braun was transferred to [[NASA]]'s nearby [[Marshall Spaceflight Center]] (MSFC), to design [[launch vehicle]]s in the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn family]].\n\n==Developmental history==\nIn the late 1920s, a young [[Wernher von Braun]] bought a copy of [[Hermann Oberth]]'s book, ''[[Wege zur Raumschiffahrt|Die Rakete zu den Planetenr\u00e4umen]]'' (''The Rocket into Interplanetary Spaces'').<ref name=\"WvB\">[[Wernher von Braun#Early life]].</ref> Starting in 1930, he attended the [[Technical University of Berlin]], where he assisted Oberth in liquid-fueled rocket motor tests.<ref name=\"WvB\"/> Von Braun was working on his doctorate when the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] gained power in Germany.<ref name=\"PrusRocketeer\">[[Wernher von Braun#The Prussian rocketeer and working under the Nazis]].</ref> An artillery captain, [[Walter Dornberger]], arranged an Ordnance Department research grant for von Braun, who from then on worked next to Dornberger's existing solid-fuel rocket test site at [[Kummersdorf]].<ref name=\"PrusRocketeer\"/> Von Braun's thesis, ''Construction, Theoretical, and Experimental Solution to the Problem of the Liquid Propellant Rocket'' (dated 16 April 1934), was kept classified by the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] and was not published until 1960.<ref>''Konstruktive, theoretische und experimentelle Beitr\u00e4ge zu dem Problem der Fl\u00fcssigkeitsrakete.

The rocket reached a height of {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}} after shutting off the engine.<ref>[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] V2 Factory: Nordhausen 070723</ref>\n\nThe fuel and oxidizer pumps were driven by a steam turbine, and the steam was produced by concentrated [[hydrogen peroxide]] with [[sodium permanganate]] [[catalyst]]. Both the alcohol and oxygen tanks were an aluminium-magnesium alloy.<ref name=Kennedy>{{cite book |last=Kennedy|first= Gregory P.|title=Vengeance Weapon 2: The V-2 Guided Missile|year=1983 |publisher= Smithsonian Institution Press|location= Washington DC|pages=27, 74}}</ref>\n\nThe combustion burner reached a temperature of {{convert|2500|to|2700|C|F}}. The alcohol-water fuel was pumped along the double wall of the main combustion burner. This [[regenerative cooling (rocket)|regenerative cooling]] heated the fuel and cooled the [[combustion chamber]]. The fuel was then pumped into the main burner chamber through 1,224 nozzles, which assured the correct mixture of alcohol and oxygen at all times. Small holes also permitted some alcohol to escape directly into the combustion chamber, forming a cooled [[boundary layer]] that further protected the wall of the chamber, especially at the throat where the chamber was narrowest. The boundary layer alcohol ignited on contact with the atmosphere, accounting for the long, diffuse exhaust plume. By contrast, later, post-V-2 engine designs not employing this alcohol boundary layer cooling show a translucent plume with [[shock diamond]]s.\n\nThe warhead was another source of troubles. The explosive employed was [[amatol|amatol 60/40]] detonated by an electric [[contact fuze]]. Amatol had the advantage of stability and the warhead was protected by a thick layer of [[fiberglass]], but even so it could still explode in the re-entry phase. The warhead weighed {{convert|975|kg|lb}} and contained {{convert|910|kg|lb}} of explosive. The warhead's percentage by weight that was explosive was 93%, a very high percentage when compared with other types of munition.\n\nThe protective layer was used for the fuel tanks as well and the A-4 did not have the tendency to form ice, which was common to other early missiles (like the [[balloon tank]]-design [[SM-65 Atlas]]). The tanks held {{convert|4173|kg|lb}} of ethyl alcohol and {{convert|5553|kg|lb}} of oxygen.<ref>War machine encyclopedia, Limited publishing, London 1983 p 1690-92</ref>\n\n[[File:Antwerp V-2.jpg|thumb|Captured V-2 on public display in Antwerp, 1945. Exhaust vanes and external rudders in tail section shown.]]\nThe V-2 was guided by four external rudders on the tail fins, and four internal [[graphite]] vanes in the jet stream at the exit of the motor. The LEV-3 guidance system consisted of two free [[gyroscope]]s (a horizontal and a vertical) for lateral stabilization, and a [[PIGA accelerometer]] to control engine cutoff at a specified velocity. The V-2 was launched from a pre-surveyed location, so the distance and [[azimuth]] to the target were known. Fin 1 of the missile was aligned to the target azimuth.<ref>Stakem, Patrick H.

Nevertheless, the threat of what was then code-named \"Big Ben\" was great enough that efforts were made to seek countermeasures. The situation was similar to the pre-war concerns about manned bombers and led to a similar solution, the formation of the Crossbow Committee to collect, examine and develop countermeasures.\n\nEarly on, it was believed that the V-2 employed some form of radio guidance, a belief that persisted in spite of several rockets being examined without discovering anything like a radio receiver. This led to efforts to jam this non-existent guidance system as early as September 1944, using both ground and air-based jammers flying over the UK. In October a group had been sent to jam the missiles during launch. By December it was clear these systems were having no obvious effect, and jamming efforts ended.<ref name=\"stock25\">Jeremy Stocker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rr-RAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA20 \"Britain and Ballistic Missile Defence, 1942-2002\"], pp. 20-28.</ref>\n\n===Anti-aircraft gun system===\n[[Frederick Alfred Pile]], commander of [[Anti-Aircraft Command]], studied the problem and proposed that enough [[anti-aircraft gun]]s were available to produce a barrage of fire in the rocket's path, but only if provided with a reasonable prediction of the trajectory. The first estimates suggested that 320,000 shells would have to be fired for each rocket. About 2% of these were expected to fall back to the ground, almost 90 tons of rounds, which would cause far more damage than the missile. At a 25 August 1944 meeting of the Crossbow Committee, the concept was rejected.<ref name=stock25/>\n\nPile continued studying the problem, and returned with a proposal to fire only 150 shells at a single rocket, with those shells using a new fuse that would greatly reduce the number that fell back to Earth unexploded. Some low-level analysis suggested that this would be successful against 1 in 50 rockets, provided that accurate trajectories were forwarded to the gunners in time. Work on this basic concept continued and developed into a plan to deploy a large number of guns in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] that were provided with pre-configured firing data for {{convert|2.5|mi|km|1|adj=mid|abbr=off}} grids of the London area. After the trajectory was determined, the guns would aim and fire between 60 and 500 rounds.<ref name=stock25/>\n\nAt a Crossbow meeting on 15 January 1945 Pile's updated plan was presented with some strong advocacy from [[Roderic Hill]] and [[Charles Drummond Ellis]]. However, the Committee suggested that a test not be carried out as no technique for tracking the missiles with sufficient accuracy had yet been developed. By March this had changed significantly, with 81% of incoming missiles correctly allotted to the grid square each fell into, or the one beside it. At a 26 March meeting the plan moved ahead, and Pile was directed to a subcommittee with [[RV Jones]] and Ellis to further develop the statistics. Three days later the team returned a report stating that if the guns fired 2,000 rounds at a missile there was a 1 in 60 chance of shooting it down. Plans for an operational test began, but as Pile later put it, \"[[Bernard Montgomery|Monty]] beat us to it\", as the attacks ended with the Allied liberation of their launching areas.<ref name=stock25/>\n\nWith the Germans no longer in control of any part of the continent that could be used as a launching site capable of striking London, they turned their attention on Antwerp. Plans were made to move the Pile system to protect that city, but the war ended before anything could be done.<ref name=stock25/>\n\n===Direct attack===\nAnother defence against the V-2 campaign was to destroy the launch infrastructure\u2014expensive in terms of bomber resources and casualties\u2014or to cause the Germans to aim at the wrong place through [[disinformation]]. The British were able to convince the Germans to direct [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]]s and V-2s aimed at London to less populated areas east of the city. This was done by sending deceptive reports on the damage caused and sites hit via the German espionage network in Britain, which was controlled by the British (the [[Double-Cross System]]).{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}}\n\nAccording the BBC television presenter [[Raymond Baxter]], who served with the RAF during the war, in February 1945 his squadron was carrying out a mission against a V2 launch site, when one missile was launched in front of them. One member of Baxter's squadron opened fire on it, without effect.{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}}\n\nOn 3 March 1945 the Allies attempted to destroy V-2s and launching equipment in the \"Haagse Bos\" in The Hague by a [[Bombing of the Bezuidenhout|large-scale bombardment]], but due to navigational errors the [[Bezuidenhout]] quarter was destroyed, killing 511 Dutch civilians.  Churchill sent a scathing minute to General Ismay requesting a thorough explanation for \"this extraordinarily bad aiming\".<ref>Churchill to Ismay: 18 March 1945</ref>\n\n==Assessment==\nThe German V-weapons (V-1 and V-2) cost the equivalent of around USD $40 billion (2015 dollars), which was 50 percent more than the [[Manhattan Project]] that produced the atomic bomb.<ref name=Ordway/>{{Rp|178}}\n6,048 V-2s were built, at a cost of approximately 100,000 [[German reichsmark|Reichsmarks]] (GB\u00a32,370,000 (2011)) each; 3,225 were launched. \nSS General [[Hans Kammler]], who as an [[engineer]] had constructed several [[concentration camp]]s including [[Auschwitz]], had a reputation for brutality and had originated the idea of using concentration camp prisoners as [[slavery|slave]] laborers in the rocket program.

This reduced its effectiveness. Furthermore, its early guidance systems were too primitive to hit specific targets and its costs were approximately equivalent to four-engined bombers{{Citation needed|dateFebruary 2016|date=February 2016}}, which were more accurate (though only in a [[Strategic Bombing During World War II#Effectiveness|relative sense]]), had longer ranges, carried many more warheads, and were reusable. In comparison, in one 24-hour period during [[Operation Hurricane (1944)|Operation Hurricane]], the RAF dropped over 10,000 [[long ton]]s of bombs on [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] and [[Duisburg]], roughly equivalent to the amount of explosives that could be delivered by 10,000 V-2 rockets. Moreover, it diverted resources from other, more effective programs. That said, the limiting factor for German aviation after 1941 was always the availability of [[Synthetic fuel#History|high test aviation gas]], not planes or pilots, so criticisms of the V-1 and V-2 programs that compare their cost to hypothetical increases in fighter or bomber production are misguided. Nevertheless, the weapon had a considerable psychological effect because, unlike bombing planes or the [[V-1 Flying Bomb]] (which made a characteristic buzzing sound), the V-2 travelled faster than the [[speed of sound]] and gave no warning before impact. There was no effective defence and no risk of pilot and crew casualties.\n\nWith the war all but lost, regardless of the factory output of conventional weapons, the Nazis resorted to V-weapons as a tenuous last hope to influence the war militarily (hence Antwerp as V-2 target), as an extension of their desire to \"punish\" their foes and most importantly to give hope to their supporters with their [[Wunderwaffe|miracle weapon]].<ref name=Irons/>  The V-2 had no effect on the outcome of the war, but it led to the [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]]s of the [[Cold War]] and modern space exploration.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n==Unfulfilled plans==\nA submarine-towed launch platform was tested successfully, making it the prototype for [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s.

Huber, ed.s, ''The Century of Space Science'', vol. 1 (Dordrecht, Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMk3adgqfawC&pg=PA41#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 41.] See also: [http://www.spaceline.org/history/6.html SpaceLine.org]</ref> This led to an eclectic array of experiments that flew on V-2s and paved the way for American manned [[space exploration]]. Devices were sent aloft to sample the air at all levels to determine [[atmospheric pressure]]s and to see what [[gases]] were present. Other instruments measured the level of [[cosmic radiation]].\n\n[[File:First photo from space.jpg|thumb|The first photo from space was taken from a V-2 launched by US scientists on 24 October 1946.]]\n\nOnly 68 percent of the V-2 trials were considered successful.<ref>{{cite web |title=V-2 Rocket Components |url=http://www.wsmr.army.mil/PAO/WSHist/V2/Pages/V2RocketComponents.aspx |publisher = U.S. Army, White Sands Missile Range |year=2010 |accessdate=14 December 2013}}</ref>  A supposed V-2 launched on 29 May 1947 landed near Juarez, Mexico and was actually a [[Hermes project|Hermes B-1 vehicle]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Beggs |first=William |url=http://www.postwarv2.com/hermes |title=Hermes Program |accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] attempted to launch a German V-2 rocket at sea&mdash;one test launch from the aircraft carrier [[USS Midway (CV-41)|USS Midway]] was performed on 6 September 1947 as part of the Navy's [[Operation Sandy]]. The test launch was a partial success; the V-2 went off the pad but splashed down in the ocean only some {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} from the carrier. The launch setup on the Midway's deck is notable in that it used foldaway arms to prevent the missile from falling over. The arms pulled away just after the engine ignited, releasing the missile. The setup may look similar to the [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7]] launch procedure but in the case of the R-7 the trusses hold the full weight of the rocket, rather than just reacting to side forces.\n\nThe [[PGM-11 Redstone]] rocket is a direct descendant of the V-2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Dictionary/REDSTONE/DI149.htm |title=Redstone rocket |publisher=centennialofflight.net |accessdate=2010-04-27}}</ref>\n\n;USSR\nThe [[Soviet Union|USSR]] also captured a number of V-2s and staff, letting them set up in Germany for a time. The first work contracts were signed in the middle of 1945. In 1946 (as part of [[Operation Osoaviakhim]]) they were obliged to move to [[Kapustin Yar]] in the USSR, where [[Helmut Gr\u00f6ttrup|Gr\u00f6ttrup]] headed up a group of just under 250 engineers. The first Soviet missile was the [[R-1 rocket|R-1]], a duplicate of the V-2. Most of the German team was sent home after that project but some remained to do research until as late as 1951. Unknown to the Germans, work immediately began on larger missiles, the [[R-2 rocket|R-2]] and [[R-5 missile|R-5]], based on extension of the V-2 technology.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn the autumn of 1945, the group M. Tikhonravov K. and N. G. Chernyshov at NII-4 rocket artillery Academy of Sciences developed on their own initiative the first stratospheric rocket project.  [[Project BP-190|BP-190]] called for vertical flight of two pilots to an altitude of 200&nbsp;km using captured German V-2 rockets.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Astronautics: Summary and Prospects|date=December 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9783709106488|volume=|pages=1\u20132|asin=|author=Anatoli I.
