It asserts that a floating impedance element, supplied by two voltage sources connected in series, may be split into two grounded elements with corresponding impedances. There is also a [[#Dual Miller theorem (for currents)|dual Miller theorem]] with regards to impedance supplied by two current sources connected in parallel. The two versions are based on the two [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]].\n\nMiller theorems are not only pure mathematical expressions. These arrangements explain important circuit phenomena about modifying impedance ([[Miller effect]], [[virtual ground]], [[Bootstrapping (electronics)|bootstrapping]], [[negative impedance]], etc.) and help in designing and understanding various commonplace circuits (feedback amplifiers, resistive and time-dependent converters, negative impedance converters, etc.). The theorems are useful in 'circuit analysis' especially for analyzing circuits with feedback<ref name = \"netlecturer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.netlecturer.com/NTOnLine/T08_THEOREMS/p06MiscTheorems.htm#G7 |title=Miscellaneous network theorems |publisher=Netlecturer.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03}}</ref> and certain transistor amplifiers at high frequencies.<ref name = \"sandiego\">{{cite web|url=http://home.sandiego.edu/~ekim/e194rfs01/millers.pdf |title=EEE 194RF: Miller's theorem |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03}}</ref>\n\nThere is a close relationship between Miller theorem and Miller effect: the theorem may be considered as a generalization of the effect and the effect may be thought as of a special case of the theorem.\n\n== Miller theorem (for voltages) ==\n\n=== Definition ===\n\nThe Miller theorem establishes that in a linear circuit, if there exists a branch with impedance ''Z'', connecting two nodes with nodal voltages ''V<sub>1</sub>'' and ''V<sub>2</sub>'', we can replace this branch by two branches connecting the corresponding nodes to ground by impedances respectively Z/(1 &minus; K) and KZ/(K &minus; 1), where K = V<sub>2</sub>/V<sub>1</sub>. The Miller theorem may be proved by using the equivalent two-port network technique to replace the two-port to its equivalent and by applying the source absorption theorem.<ref name = \"paginas\">{{cite web|url=http://paginas.fe.up.pt/~fff/eBook/MDA/Teo_Miller.html |title=Miller's theorem |publisher=Paginas.fe.up.pt |date= |accessdate=2013-02-03}}</ref> This version of the Miller theorem is based on [[Kirchhoff's voltage law]]; for that reason, it is named also ''Miller theorem for voltages''.\n\n=== Explanation ===\nSchematic missing\n\nMiller theorem implies that an impedance element is supplied by two arbitrary (not necessarily dependent) voltage sources that are connected in series through the common ground. In practice, one of them acts as a main (independent) voltage source with voltage ''V<sub>1</sub>'' and the other \u2013 as an additional (linearly dependent) voltage source with voltage <math>V_2 = K{V_1}</math>. The idea of Miller theorem (modifying circuit impedances seen from the sides of the input and output sources) is revealed below by comparing the two situations \u2013 without and with connecting an additional voltage source V<sub>2</sub>.\n\nIf ''V<sub>2</sub>'' was zero (there was not a second voltage source or the right end of the element with impedance ''Z'' was just grounded), the input current flowing through the element would be determined, according to Ohm's law, only by ''V<sub>1</sub>''\n\n:<math>I_{in0} = \\frac{V_1}{Z}</math>\n\nand the input impedance of the circuit would be\n\n:<math>Z_{in0} = \\frac{V_1}{I_{in0}} = Z.</math>\n\nAs a second voltage source is included, the input current depends on both the voltages. According to its polarity, ''V<sub>2</sub>'' is subtracted from or added to ''V<sub>1</sub>''; so, the input current decreases/increases\n\n:<math>I_{in} = \\frac{V_1 - V_2}{Z} = \\frac{(1 - K)}{Z}{V_1} = {(1 - K)}{I_{in0}}</math>\n\nand the input impedance of the circuit seen from the side of the input source accordingly increases/decreases\n\n:<math>Z_{in} = \\frac{V_1}{I_{in}} = \\frac{Z}{1-K}.</math>\n\nSo, Miller theorem expresses the fact that '''''connecting a second voltage source with proportional voltage <math>V_2 = K{V_1}</math> in series with the input voltage source changes the effective voltage, the current and respectively, the circuit impedance seen from the side of the input source'''''. Depending on the polarity, ''V<sub>2</sub>'' acts as a supplemental voltage source helping or opposing the main voltage source to pass the current through the impedance.\n\nBesides by presenting the combination of the two voltage sources as a new composed voltage source, the theorem may be explained by ''combining the actual element and the second voltage source into a new virtual element with dynamically modified impedance''. From this viewpoint, ''V<sub>2</sub>'' is an additional voltage that artificially increases/decreases the voltage drop ''V<sub>z</sub>'' across the impedance ''Z'' thus decreasing/increasing the current. The proportion between the voltages determines the value of the obtained impedance (see the tables below) and gives in total six groups of typical [[#Applications|applications]].\n\n{| border=\"1\"\n|+'''Subtracting ''V<sub>2</sub>'' from ''V<sub>1</sub>'''''\n|-\n|<center>'''''V<sub>2</sub>'' vs ''V<sub>1</sub>'''''</center>||<center>'''''V<sub>2</sub>'' = 0'''</center>||<center>'''0 < ''V<sub>2</sub>'' < ''V<sub>1</sub>'''''</center>||<center>'''''V<sub>2</sub>'' = ''V<sub>1</sub>'''''</center>||<center>'''''V<sub>2</sub>'' > ''V<sub>1</sub>'''''</center>\n|-\n|<center>'''Impedance'''<center>||<center>normal</center>||<center>increased</center>||<center>infinite</center>||<center>negative with current inversion</center>\n|}\n\n{| border=\"1\"\n|+'''Adding ''V<sub>2</sub>'' to ''V<sub>1</sub>'''''\n|-\n|<center>'''''V<sub>2</sub>'' vs ''V<sub>z</sub>'''''</center>||<center>'''''V<sub>2</sub>'' = 0'''</center>||<center>'''0 < ''V<sub>2</sub>'' < ''V<sub>z</sub>'''''</center>||<center>'''''V<sub>2</sub>'' = ''V<sub>z</sub>'''''</center>||<center>'''''V<sub>2</sub>'' > ''V<sub>z</sub>'''''</center>\n|-\n|<center>'''Impedance'''<center>||<center>normal</center>||<center>decreased</center>||<center>zero</center>||<center>negative with voltage inversion</center>\n|}\n\nThe circuit impedance, seen from the side of the output source, may be defined similarly, if the voltages ''V<sub>1</sub>'' and ''V<sub>2</sub>'' are swapped and the coefficient ''K'' is replaced by 1/''K''\n\n:<math>Z_{in2} = \\frac{{K}{Z}}{K-1}.</math>\n\n=== Implementation ===\n\n[[Image:Miller cir.png|right|frame|A typical implementation of Miller theorem based on a single-ended voltage amplifier]]\n\nMost frequently, the Miller theorem may be observed in, and implemented by, an arrangement consisting of an element with impedance ''Z'' connected between the two terminals of a grounded general linear network.<ref name=\"sandiego\"/> Usually, a voltage amplifier with gain of <math>A_V = K</math> serves as such a linear network, but also other devices can play this role: a man and a [[potentiometer]] in a [[Potentiometer (measuring instrument)#Constant current potentiometer|potentiometric null-balance meter]], an electromechanical integrator (servomechanisms using potentiometric feedback sensors), etc.\n\nIn the amplifier implementation, the input voltage ''V<sub>i</sub>'' serves as ''V<sub>1</sub>'' and the output voltage ''V<sub>o</sub>'' \u2013 as ''V<sub>2</sub>''. In many cases, the input voltage source has some internal impedance <math>Z_{int}</math> or an additional input impedance is connected that, in combination with ''Z'', introduces a feedback. Depending on the kind of amplifier (non-inverting, inverting or differential), the feedback can be positive, negative or mixed.\n\nThe Miller amplifier arrangement has two aspects:\n*the amplifier may be thought as an additional voltage source converting the actual impedance into a ''virtual impedance'' (the amplifier modifies the impedance of the actual element)\n* the virtual impedance may be thought as an element connected in parallel to the amplifier input (the virtual impedance modifies the amplifier input impedance).\n\n=== Applications ===\n\nThe introduction of an impedance that connects amplifier input and output ports adds a great\ndeal of complexity in the analysis process. Miller theorem helps reduce the\ncomplexity in some circuits particularly with feedback<ref name = \"sandiego\" /> by converting them to simpler equivalent circuits. But Miller theorem is not only an effective tool for creating equivalent circuits; it is also a powerful tool for designing and understanding circuits based on ''modifying impedance by additional voltage''. Depending on the polarity of the output voltage versus the input voltage and the proportion between their magnitudes, there are six groups of typical situations. In some of them, the Miller phenomenon appears as desired ([[Bootstrapping (electronics)|bootstrapping]]) or undesired ([[Miller effect]]) unintentional effects; in other cases it is intentionally introduced.\n\n==== Applications based on subtracting ''V<sub>2</sub>'' from ''V<sub>1</sub> ====\n\nIn these applications, the output voltage ''V<sub>o</sub>'' is inserted with an opposite polarity in respect to the input voltage ''V<sub>i</sub>'' travelling along the loop (but in respect to ground, the polarities are the same). As a result, the effective voltage across, and the current through, the impedance decrease; the input impedance increases.\n\n{{anchor|increased}}'''Increased impedance''' is implemented by a non-inverting amplifier with gain of 0 < A<sub>v</sub> < 1. The (magnitude of) output voltage is less than the input voltage ''V<sub>i</sub>'' and partially neutralizes it. Examples are imperfect voltage followers ([[Emitter follower|emitter]], [[Source follower|source]], [[Cathode follower|cathode]] follower, etc.) and amplifiers with series negative feedback ([[Common emitter#Emitter degeneration|emitter degeneration]]), whose input impedance is moderately increased.\n\n[[Image:Op-Amp Non-Inverting Amplifier.svg|right|frame|The op-amp non-inverting amplifier is a typical circuit with series negative feedback based on the Miller theorem, where the op-amp differential input impedance is apparently increased up to infinity]]\n\n{{anchor|infinite}}'''Infinite impedance''' uses a non-inverting amplifier with A<sub>v</sub> = 1. The output voltage is equal to the input voltage ''V<sub>i</sub>'' and completely neutralizes it. Examples are [[Potentiometer (measuring instrument)#Constant current potentiometer|potentiometric null-balance meters]] and op-amp followers and amplifiers with series negative feedback ([[Voltage buffer|op-amp follower]] and [[Operational amplifier applications#Non-inverting amplifier|non-inverting amplifier]]) where the circuit input impedance is enormously increased. This technique is referred to as [[Bootstrapping (electronics)|bootstrapping]] and is intentionally used in biasing circuits, input guarding circuits,<ref>[http://www.national.com/an/AN/AN-241.pdf Working with High Impedance Op Amps] AN-241</ref> etc.\n\n{{anchor|negative current inversion}}'''Negative impedance obtained by current inversion''' is implemented by a non-inverting amplifier with A<sub>v</sub> > 1. The current changes its direction, as the output voltage is higher than the input voltage. If the input voltage source has some internal impedance <math>Z_{int}</math> or if it is connected through another impedance element, a positive feedback appears. A typical application is the [[Negative impedance converter|negative impedance converter with current inversion]] (INIC) that uses both negative and positive feedback (the negative feedback is used to realize a non-inverting amplifier and the positive feedback \u2013 to modify the impedance).\n\n==== Applications based on adding ''V<sub>2</sub>'' to ''V<sub>1</sub> ====\n\nIn these applications, the output voltage ''V<sub>o</sub>'' is inserted with the same polarity  in respect to the input voltage ''V<sub>i</sub>'' travelling along the loop (but in respect to ground, the polarities are opposite). As a result, the effective voltage across and the current through the impedance increase; the input impedance decreases.\n\n{{anchor|decreased}}'''Decreased impedance''' is implemented by an inverting amplifier having some moderate gain, usually 10 < A<sub>v</sub> < 1000. It may be observed as an undesired [[Miller effect]] in [[common-emitter]], [[common-source]] and ''common-cathode'' amplifying stages where effective input capacitance is increased. [[Frequency compensation#Dominant-pole compensation|Frequency compensation]] for general purpose operational amplifiers and [https://books.google.com/books?id=mfec2Zw_b7wC&pg=PA284&lpg=PA284&dq=%22transistor+Miller+integrator+%22&source=bl&ots=-8PdcUw4LD&sig=zOjnF9O-oUBjw0bU9a_SMYdgCYY&hl=en&ei=C7yMTIDjGM7Oswb3oLy7Ag&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22transistor%20Miller%20integrator%20%22&f=false transistor Miller integrator] are examples of useful usage of the Miller effect.\n\n[[Image:Op-Amp Inverting Amplifier.svg|right|frame|The op-amp inverting amplifier is a typical circuit, with parallel negative feedback, based on the Miller theorem, where the op-amp differential input impedance is apparently decreased up to zero]]\n\n{{anchor|zeroed}}'''Zeroed impedance''' uses an inverting (usually op-amp) amplifier with enormously high gain A<sub>v</sub> \u2192 \u221e. The output voltage is almost equal to the voltage drop ''V<sub>Z</sub>'' across the impedance and completely neutralizes it. The circuit behaves as a short connection and a [[virtual ground]] appears at the input; so, it should not be driven by a constant voltage source. For this purpose, some circuits are driven by a constant current source or by a real voltage source with internal impedance: [[current-to-voltage converter]] (transimpedance amplifier), capacitive integrator (named also [[current integrator]] or [[charge amplifier]]), resistance-to-voltage converter (a resistive sensor connected in the place of the impedance ''Z'').\n\nThe rest of them have additional impedance connected in series to the input: [[voltage-to-current converter]] (transconductance amplifier), [[inverting amplifier]], [[summing amplifier]], inductive integrator, capacitive differentiator, [[Operational amplifier applications#Inverting integrator|resistive-capacitive integrator]], [[Operational amplifier applications#Inverting differentiator|capacitive-resistive differentiator]], inductive-resistive differentiator, etc. The inverting integrators from this list are examples of useful and desired applications of the Miller effect in its extreme manifestation.\n\nIn all these ''op-amp inverting circuits with parallel negative feedback'', the input current is increased to its maximum. It is determined only by the input voltage and the input impedance according to [[Ohm's law]]; it does not depend on the impedance ''Z''.\n\n{{anchor|negative with voltage inversion}}'''Negative impedance with voltage inversion''' is implemented by applying both negative and positive feedback to an op-amp amplifier with a differential input. The input voltage source has to have internal impedance <math>Z_{int}</math> > 0 or it has to be connected through another impedance element to the input. Under these conditions, the input voltage ''V<sub>i</sub>'' of the circuit changes its polarity as the output voltage exceeds the voltage drop ''V<sub>Z</sub>'' across the impedance (''V<sub>i</sub>''  = ''V<sub>z</sub>'' \u2013 ''V<sub>o</sub>'' < 0).\n\nA typical application is a negative impedance converter with voltage inversion (VNIC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nonlinear.eecs.berkeley.edu/chaos/introduction_nonlinear_circuit_analysis.pdf|title=Nonlinear Circuit Analysis \u2013 An Introduction|date=|format=PDF|accessdate=2013-02-03}}</ref> It is interesting that the circuit input voltage has the same polarity as the output voltage, although it is applied to the inverting op-amp input; the input source has an opposite polarity to both the circuit input and output voltages.\n\n=== Generalization of Miller arrangement ===\n\nThe original Miller effect is implemented by capacitive impedance connected between the two nodes. Miller theorem generalizes Miller effect as it implies arbitrary impedance Z connected between the nodes. It is supposed also a constant coefficient K; then the expressions [[#Explanation|above]] are valid. But modifying properties of Miller theorem exist even when these requirements are violated and this arrangement can be generalized further by dynamizing the impedance and the coefficient.\n\n'''Non-linear element.''' Besides impedance, Miller arrangement can modify the IV characteristic of an arbitrary element. The circuit of a [[Operational amplifier applications#Logarithmic output|diode log converter]] is an example of a non-linear [[#zeroed|virtually zeroed resistance]] where the logarithmic [[diode#Current\u2013voltage characteristic|forward IV curve of a diode]] is transformed to a vertical straight line overlapping the Y axis.\n \n'''Not constant coefficient.''' If the coefficient K varies, some exotic virtual elements can be obtained. A [[Gyrator#Application: a simulated inductor|gyrator circuit]] is an example of such a virtual element where the resistance R<sub>L</sub> is modified so that to mimic inductance, capacitance or inversed resistance.\n\n== Dual Miller theorem (for currents) ==\n\n=== Definition ===\nThere is also a dual version of Miller theorem that is based on [[Kirchhoff's current law]] (''Miller theorem for currents''): if there is a branch in a circuit with impedance Z connecting a node, where two currents I<sub>1</sub> and I<sub>2</sub> converge to ground, we can replace this branch by two conducting the referred currents, with impedances respectively equal to (1 + \u03b1)Z and (1 + \u03b1)Z/\u03b1, where \u03b1 = I<sub>2</sub>/I<sub>1</sub>. The dual theorem may be proved by replacing the two-port network by its equivalent and by applying the source absorption theorem.<ref name = \"paginas\" />\n\n=== Explanation ===\nDual Miller theorem actually expresses the fact that '''''connecting a second current source producing proportional current <math>I_2 = K{I_1}</math> in parallel with the main input source and the impedance element changes the current flowing through it, the voltage and accordingly, the circuit impedance seen from the side of the input source'''''. Depending on the direction, ''I<sub>2</sub>'' acts as a supplemental current source helping or opposing the main current source ''I<sub>1</sub>'' to create voltage across the impedance. The combination of the actual element and the second current source may be thought as of a new virtual element with dynamically modified impedance.\n\n=== Implementation ===\nDual Miller theorem is usually implemented by an arrangement consisting of two voltage sources supplying the grounded impedance ''Z'' through floating impedances (see [http://www.maxim-ic.com/app-notes/index.mvp/id/1155 Fig. 3]). The combinations of the voltage sources and belonging impedances form the two current sources \u2013 the main and the auxiliary one. As in the case of the main Miller theorem, the second voltage is usually produced by a voltage amplifier. Depending on the kind of the amplifier (inverting, non-inverting or differential) and the gain, the circuit input impedance may be virtually increased, infinite, decreased, zero or negative.\n\n=== Applications ===\nAs the main Miller theorem, besides helping circuit analysis process, the dual version is a powerful tool for designing and understanding circuits based on modifying impedance by additional current. Typical applications are some exotic circuits with negative impedance as load cancellers,<ref name=\"load canceller\">[http://electronicdesign.com/power/negative-resistance-load-canceller-helps-drive-heavy-loads Negative-resistance load canceller helps drive heavy loads]</ref> capacitance neutralizers,<ref>{{ Citation |url=http://www.philbrickarchive.org/1964-1_v12_no1_the_lightning_empiricist.htm |title=Impedance and admittance transformations using operational amplifiers |author=D.

The input voltage source and the resistor R constitute an imperfect current source passing current ''I<sub>R</sub>'' through the load (see Fig. 3 in the source). The INIC acts as a second current source passing \"helping\" current ''I<sub>-R</sub>'' through the load. As a result, the total current flowing through the load is constant and the circuit impedance seen by the input source is increased. As a comparison, in a [http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?AD=1&ArticleID=4128 load canceller], the INIC passes all the required current through the load; the circuit impedance seen from the side of the input source (the load impedance) is almost infinite.\n\n== List of specific applications based on Miller theorems ==\n\nBelow is a list of circuit solutions, phenomena and techniques based on the two Miller theorems.\n\n{{hidden begin|toggle=left|title=Circuit solutions|titlestyle=padding-left: 4em;}}\n\n* Potentiometric null-balance meter\n* Electromechanical data recorders with a potentiometric servo system\n* Emitter (source, cathode) follower\n* Transistor amplifier with emitter (source, cathode) degeneration\n* Transistor bootstrapped biasing circuits\n* Transistor integrator\n* Common-emitter (common-source,  common-cathode) amplifying stages with stray capacitances\n* Op-amp follower\n* Op-amp non-inverting amplifier\n* Op-amp bootstrapped AC follower with high input impedance\n* Bilateral current source\n* Negative impedance converter with current inversion (INIC)\n* Negative impedance load canceller\n* Negative impedance input capacitance canceller\n* Howland current source\n* Deboo integrator\n* Op-amp inverting ammeter\n* Op-amp voltage-to-current converter (transconductance amplifier)\n* Op-amp current-to-voltage converter (transimpedance amplifier)\n* Op-amp resistance-to-current converter\n* Op-amp resistance-to-voltage converter\n* Op-amp inverting amplifier\n* Op-amp inverting summer\n* Op-amp inverting capacitive integrator (current integrator, charge amplifier)\n* Op-amp inverting resistive-capacitive integrator\n* Op-amp inverting capacitive differentiator\n* Op-amp inverting capacitive-resistive differentiator\n* Op-amp inverting inductive integrator\n* Op-amp inverting inductive-resistive differentiator, etc.\n* Op-amp diode log converter\n* Op-amp diode anti-log converter\n* Op-amp inverting diode limiter (precision diode)\n* Negative impedance converter with voltage inversion (VNIC), etc.\n{{hidden end}}\n\n{{hidden begin|toggle=left|title=Circuit phenomena and techniques|titlestyle=padding-left: 4em;}}\n* Bootstrapping\n* Input guarding of high impedance op-amp circuits\n* Input-capacitance neutralization\n* Virtual ground\n* Miller effect\n* Frequency op-amp compensation\n* Negative impedance\n* Load cancelling\n{{hidden end}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Miller effect]]\n*[[Negative feedback amplifier]]\n*[[Operational amplifier applications]]\n*[[Bootstrapping (electronics)#Amplifiers|Bootstrapping]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.springerlink.com/content/p588u5532kk44t13/ Miller's theorem revisited]\n* [http://www.springerlink.com/content/d63h832p1q7hk118/ New Results Related to Miller\u2019s Theorem]\n* [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel1%2F13%2F497%2F00009752.pdf%3Farnumber%3D9752&authDecision=-203 A network theorem dual to Miller's theorem]\n* [http://sciencestage.com/d/4200272/generalized-miller-theorem-and-its-applications.html Generalized Miller theorem and its applications]\n* [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/002072198133860 The Feedback Decomposition Theorem (FDT): The evolution of Miller's Theorem]\n* [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1495756&tag=1 An Accurate Calculation of Miller Effect on the Frequency Response and on the Input and Output Impedances of Feedback Amplifiers (using FDT)]\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n*''Fundamentals of Microelectronics'' by Behzad Razavi\n*''Microelectronic Circuits'' by Adel Sedra and Kenneth Smith\n*''Fundamentals of RF Circuit Design'' by Jeremy Everard\n\n[[Category:Electrical engineering]]\n[[Category:Electronic design]]\n[[Category:Analog circuits]]\n[[Category:Circuit theorems]]"}]}}}}
