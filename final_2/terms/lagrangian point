The Lagrange points mark positions where the combined [[gravitational pull]] of the two large masses provides precisely the [[centripetal force]] required to [[orbit]] with them. There are five such points, labeled L<sub>1</sub> to L<sub>5</sub>, all in the orbital plane of the two large bodies. The first three are on the line connecting the two large bodies and the last two, L<sub>4</sub> and L<sub>5</sub>, each form an [[equilateral triangle]] with the two large bodies. The two latter points are stable, which implies that objects can orbit around them in a rotating [[coordinate system]] tied to the two large bodies.\n\nSeveral planets have [[trojan (astronomy)| satellites near their L<sub>4</sub> and L<sub>5</sub> points]] (trojans) with respect to the Sun, with [[Jupiter#Interaction with the Solar System|Jupiter]] in particular having more than a million of these.

It is the most intuitively understood of the Lagrangian points: the one where the gravitational attraction of ''M''<sub>2</sub> partially cancels ''M''<sub>1</sub>'s gravitational attraction.\n\n;Explanation : An object that [[orbit]]s the [[Sun]] more closely than [[Earth]] would normally have a shorter orbital period than Earth, but that ignores the effect of Earth's own gravitational pull. If the object is directly between Earth and the Sun, then Earth's gravity counteracts some of the Sun's pull on the object, and therefore increases the orbital period of the object. The closer to Earth the object is, the greater this effect is. At the {{L1|nolink=yes}} point, the orbital period of the object becomes exactly equal to Earth's orbital period. {{L1|nolink=yes}} is about 1.5&nbsp;million kilometers from Earth.<ref name=\"Lagrange Cornish\">{{cite web|last1=Cornish|first1=Neil J.|title=The Lagrangian Points|date=|url=http://www.physics.montana.edu/faculty/cornish/lagrange.pdf| archive-url     =https://web.archive.org/web/20150907090116/http://www.physics.montana.edu/faculty/cornish/lagrange.pdf|archive-date=September 7, 2015|dead-url=yes|website=|accessdate=15 Dec 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe '''{{L2|nolink=yes}}''' point lies on the line through the two large masses, beyond the smaller of the two. Here, the gravitational forces of the two large masses balance the centrifugal effect on a body at {{L2|nolink=yes}}.\n\n;Explanation : On the opposite side of Earth from the Sun, the orbital period of an object would normally be greater than that of Earth. The extra pull of Earth's gravity decreases the orbital period of the object, and at the {{L2|nolink=yes}} point that orbital period becomes equal to Earth's. Like L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub> is about 1.5&nbsp;million kilometers from Earth.\n\nThe '''{{L3|nolink=yes}}''' point lies on the line defined by the two large masses, beyond the larger of the two.\n\n;Explanation : {{L3|nolink=yes}} in the Sun\u2013Earth system exists on the opposite side of the Sun, a little outside Earth's orbit but slightly closer to the Sun than Earth is. (This apparent contradiction is because the Sun is also affected by Earth's gravity, and so orbits around the two bodies' [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|barycenter]], which is, however, well inside the body of the Sun.) At the {{L3|nolink=yes}} point, the combined pull of Earth and Sun again causes the object to orbit with the same period as Earth.\n\n[[File:L4 diagram.svg|thumb|right|200px|Gravitational accelerations at {{L4|nolink=yes}}]]\nThe '''{{L4|nolink=yes}}''' and '''{{L5|nolink=yes}}''' points lie at the third corners of the two [[equilateral triangle]]s in the plane of orbit whose common base is the line between the centers of the two masses, such that the point lies behind ({{L5|nolink=yes}}) or ahead ({{L4|nolink=yes}}) of the smaller mass with regard to its orbit around the larger mass.\n\nThe triangular points ({{L4|nolink=yes}} and {{L5|nolink=yes}}) are stable equilibria, provided that the ratio of {{sfrac|''M''<sub>1</sub>|''M''<sub>2</sub>}} is greater than 24.96.<ref group=\"note\">Actually {{sfrac|25 + {{sqrt|621}}|2}} \u2248 {{val|24.9599357944}}</ref><ref name=\"cornish\">{{cite web|url= http://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/media/ContentMedia/lagrange.pdf |title=The Lagrange Points }}, Neil J. Cornish with input from Jeremy Goodman</ref> This is the case for the Sun\u2013Earth system, the Sun\u2013Jupiter system, and, by a [[Orbit of the Moon#Inclination|smaller margin]], the Earth\u2013Moon system. When a body at these points is perturbed, it moves away from the point, but the factor opposite of that which is increased or decreased by the perturbation (either gravity or angular momentum-induced speed) will also increase or decrease, bending the object's path into a stable, [[kidney bean|kidney-bean]]-shaped orbit around the point (as seen in the corotating frame of reference).\n\nIn contrast to {{L4|nolink=yes}} and {{L5|nolink=yes}}, where [[Mechanical equilibrium|stable equilibrium]] exists, the points {{L1|nolink=yes}}, {{L2|nolink=yes}}, and {{L3|nolink=yes}} are positions of [[Mechanical equilibrium|unstable equilibrium]]. Any object orbiting at {{L1|nolink=yes}}, {{L2|nolink=yes}}, or {{L3|nolink=yes}} will tend to fall out of orbit; it is therefore rare to find natural objects there, and spacecraft inhabiting these areas must employ [[Orbital station-keeping|station keeping]] in order to maintain their position.\n\n==Natural objects at Lagrangian points==\n\nIt is common to find objects at or orbiting the {{L4|nolink=yes}} and {{L5|nolink=yes}} points of natural orbital systems. These are commonly called \"trojans\"; in the 20th century, asteroids discovered orbiting at the Sun\u2013[[Jupiter]] {{L4|nolink=yes}} and {{L5|nolink=yes}} points were named after characters from [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. Asteroids at the {{L4|nolink=yes}} point, which leads Jupiter, are referred to as the \"[[List of Jupiter Trojans (Greek camp)|Greek camp]]\", whereas those at the {{L5|nolink=yes}} point are referred to as the \"[[List of Jupiter Trojans (Trojan camp)|Trojan camp]]\". See also [[Trojan (astronomy)]].\n\nOther examples of natural objects orbiting at Lagrange points:\n* The Sun\u2013Earth {{L4|nolink=yes}} and {{L5|nolink=yes}} points contain interplanetary dust and at least one asteroid, {{mpl|2010 TK|7}}, detected in October 2010 by [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE) and announced during July 2011.<ref>[http://www.space.com/12443-earth-asteroid-companion-discovered-2010-tk7.html Space.com: ''First Asteroid Companion of Earth Discovered at Last'']</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2011/jul/HQ_11-247_WISE_Trojan.html|title=NASA - NASA's Wise Mission Finds First Trojan Asteroid Sharing Earth's Orbit|publisher=}}</ref>\n* The Earth\u2013Moon {{L4|nolink=yes}} and {{L5|nolink=yes}} points may contain interplanetary dust in what are called [[Kordylewski cloud]]s; however, the [[Hiten]] spacecraft's Munich Dust Counter (MDC) detected no increase in dust during its passes through these points.

The Saturnian moon [[Dione (moon)|Dione]] also has two Lagrangian co-orbitals, [[Helene (moon)|Helene]] at its {{L4|nolink=yes}} point and [[Polydeuces (moon)|Polydeuces]] at {{L5|nolink=yes}}. The moons wander [[azimuth]]ally about the Lagrangian points, with Polydeuces describing the largest deviations, moving up to 32\u00b0 away from the Saturn\u2013Dione {{L5|nolink=yes}} point. Tethys and Dione are hundreds of times more massive than their \"escorts\" (see the moons' articles for exact diameter figures; masses are not known in several cases), and Saturn is far more massive still, which makes the overall system stable.\n* One version of the [[giant impact hypothesis]] suggests that an object named [[Theia (planet)#Theia|Theia]] formed at the Sun\u2013Earth {{L4|nolink=yes}} or {{L5|nolink=yes}} points and crashed into Earth after its orbit destabilized, forming the Moon.\n* [[Mars]] has four known co-orbital asteroids ([[5261 Eureka]], {{mpl|1999 UJ|7}}, {{mpl|1998 VF|31}} and {{mpl|2007 NS|2}}), all at its Lagrangian points.\n* Earth's companion object [[3753 Cruithne]] is in a relationship with Earth that is somewhat trojan-like, but that is different from a true trojan. Cruithne occupies one of two regular [[solar orbit]]s, one of them slightly smaller and faster than Earth's, and the other slightly larger and slower. It periodically alternates between these two orbits due to close encounters with Earth. When it is in the smaller, faster orbit and approaches Earth, it gains orbital energy from Earth and moves up into the larger, slower orbit. It then falls farther and farther behind Earth, and eventually Earth approaches it from the other direction. Then Cruithne gives up orbital energy to Earth, and drops back into the smaller orbit, thus beginning the cycle anew. The cycle has no noticeable impact on the length of the year, because Earth's mass is over 20&nbsp;[[1000000000 (number)|billion]] ({{val|2|e=10}}) times more than that of 3753&nbsp;Cruithne.\n* [[Epimetheus (moon)|Epimetheus]] and [[Janus (moon)|Janus]], satellites of Saturn, have a similar relationship, though they are of similar masses and so actually exchange orbits with each other periodically. (Janus is roughly 4&nbsp;times more massive but still light enough for its orbit to be altered.) Another similar configuration is known as [[orbital resonance]], in which orbiting bodies tend to have periods of a simple integer [[ratio]], due to their interaction.\n* In a binary star system, the [[Roche lobe]] has its apex located at {{L1|nolink=yes}}; if a star overflows its Roche lobe, then it will lose matter to its [[companion star]].\n\n==Mathematical details==\n\n[[File:Lagrange points2.svg|thumb|right|330px|A contour plot of the [[effective potential]] due to gravity and the [[centrifugal force]] of a two-body system in a rotating frame of reference.

For example, given two massive bodies in orbits around their common [[barycenter]], there are five positions in space where a third body, of comparatively negligible [[mass]], could be placed so as to maintain its position relative to the two massive bodies. As seen in a [[rotating reference frame]] that matches the [[angular velocity]] of the two co-orbiting bodies, the [[gravitational field]]s of two massive bodies combined with the minor body's centrifugal force are in balance at the Lagrangian points, allowing the smaller third body to be relatively stationary with respect to the first two.<ref>\"[http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/LagrangePoints/ Lagrange Points]\" by Enrique Zeleny, [[Wolfram Demonstrations Project]].</ref>\n\n==={{L1|nolink=yes}}===<!-- Other articles link here. -->\n\nThe location of L<sub>1</sub> is the solution to the following equation, balancing gravitation and the centrifugal force:\n\n: <math>\\frac{M_1}{(R-r)^2}=\\frac{M_2}{r^2}+\\frac{M_1}{R^2}-\\frac{r\\left(M_1+M_2\\right)}{R^3}</math>\n\nwhere ''r'' is the distance of the L<sub>1</sub> point from the smaller object, ''R'' is the distance between the two main objects, and ''M''<sub>1</sub> and ''M''<sub>2</sub> are the masses of the large and small object, respectively. (The quantity in parentheses on the right is the distance of L<sub>1</sub> from the center of mass.) Solving this for ''r'' involves solving a [[quintic function]], but if the mass of the smaller object (''M''<sub>2</sub>) is much smaller than the mass of the larger object (''M''<sub>1</sub>) then {{L1|nolink=yes}} and {{L2|nolink=yes}} are at approximately equal distances ''r'' from the smaller object, equal to the radius of the [[Hill sphere]], given by:\n\n: <math>r \\approx R \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{M_2}{3 M_1}}</math>\n\nThis distance can be described as being such that the [[orbital period]], corresponding to a circular orbit with this distance as radius around ''M''<sub>2</sub> in the absence of ''M''<sub>1</sub>, is that of ''M''<sub>2</sub> around ''M''<sub>1</sub>, divided by {{sqrt|3}} \u2248 1.73:\n\n: <math>T_{s,M_2}(r) = \\frac{T_{M_2,M_1}(R)}{\\sqrt{3}}.</math>\n\n==={{L2|nolink=yes}}===<!-- Other articles link here. -->\nThe location of L<sub>2</sub> is the solution to the following equation, balancing gravitation and inertia:\n\n<math>\\frac{M_1}{(R+r)^2}+\\frac{M_2}{r^2}=\\frac{M_1}{R^2}+\\frac{r\\left(M_1+M_2\\right)}{R^3}</math>\n\nwith parameters defined as for the L<sub>1</sub> case.

Accordingly, the gravitational forces from the two massive bodies are in the same ratio as the masses of the two bodies, and so the resultant force acts through the [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|barycenter]] of the system; additionally, the geometry of the triangle ensures that the [[Parallelogram_law|resultant]] acceleration is to the distance from the barycenter in the same [[ratio]] as for the two massive bodies. The barycenter being both the [[center of mass]] and center of rotation of the three-body system, this resultant force is exactly that required to keep the smaller body at the Lagrange point in orbital [[Dynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] with the other two larger bodies of system. (Indeed, the third body need not have negligible mass.) The general triangular configuration was discovered by Lagrange in work on the [[three-body problem]].\n\n== Stability ==<!-- This section is linked from Lagrangian point -->\nAlthough the {{L1|nolink=yes}}, {{L2|nolink=yes}}, and {{L3|nolink=yes}} points are nominally unstable, it turns out that it is possible to find (unstable) periodic orbits around these points, at least in the restricted three-body problem. These periodic orbits, referred to as [[Halo orbit|\"halo\" orbits]], do not exist in a full ''n''-body dynamical system such as the [[Solar System]]. However, quasi-periodic (i.e. bounded but not precisely repeating) orbits following [[Lissajous curve|Lissajous-curve]] trajectories do exist in the ''n''-body system. These quasi-periodic [[Lissajous orbit]]s are what most of Lagrangian-point missions to date have used. Although they are not perfectly stable, a relatively modest effort at [[Orbital station-keeping|station keeping]] can allow a spacecraft to stay in a desired Lissajous orbit for an extended period of time. It also turns out that, at least in the case of Sun\u2013Earth-{{L1|nolink=yes}} missions, it is actually preferable to place the spacecraft in a large-amplitude ({{convert|100000|\u2013|200000|km|abbr=on|disp=or}}) Lissajous orbit, instead of having it sit at the Lagrangian point, because this keeps the spacecraft off the direct line between Sun and Earth, thereby reducing the impact of solar [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] on Earth\u2013spacecraft communications. Similarly, a large-amplitude Lissajous orbit around {{L2|nolink=yes}} can keep a probe out of Earth's shadow and therefore ensures a better illumination of its solar panels.\n\n==Spaceflight applications==\n\n===Sun\u2013Earth===\nSun\u2013Earth {{L1|nolink=yes}} is suited for making observations of the Sun\u2013Earth system. Objects here are never shadowed by Earth or the Moon. The first mission of this type was the [[International Cometary Explorer|International Sun Earth Explorer 3]] (ISEE-3) mission used as an interplanetary early warning storm monitor for solar disturbances.  Since June 2015, [[Deep_Space_Climate_Observatory|DSCOVR]] has orbited the L<sub>1</sub> point.\n\nSun\u2013Earth {{L2|nolink=yes}} is a good spot for space-based observatories. Because an object around {{L2|nolink=yes}} will maintain the same relative position with respect to the Sun and Earth, shielding and calibration are much simpler. It is, however, slightly beyond the reach of Earth's [[Umbra, penumbra and antumbra|umbra]],<ref>Angular size of the Sun at 1 AU + 930000 miles: 31.6\u2032, angular size of Earth at 930000 miles: 29.3\u2032</ref> so solar radiation is not completely blocked. From this point, the Sun, Earth and Moon are relatively closely positioned together in the sky, and hence leave a large field of view without interference \u2013 this is especially helpful for [[infrared astronomy]].\n\nSun\u2013Earth {{L3|nolink=yes}} was a popular place to put a \"[[Counter-Earth]]\" in [[Pulp magazine|pulp]] [[science fiction]] and [[comic book]]s. Once space-based observation became possible via satellites<ref>STEREO mission description by NASA, http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stereo/main/index.html#.UuG0NxDb-kk</ref> and probes, it was shown to hold no such object. The Sun\u2013Earth {{L3|nolink=yes}} is unstable and could not contain a natural object, large or small, for very long. This is because the gravitational forces of the other planets are stronger than that of Earth ([[Venus]], for example, comes within 0.3&nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] of this {{L3|nolink=yes}} every 20&nbsp;months).\n\nA spacecraft orbiting near Sun\u2013Earth {{L3|nolink=yes}} would be able to closely monitor the evolution of active sunspot regions before they rotate into a geoeffective position, so that a 7-day early warning could be issued by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] [[Space Weather Prediction Center]]. Moreover, a satellite near Sun\u2013Earth {{L3|nolink=yes}} would provide very important observations not only for Earth forecasts, but also for deep space support (Mars predictions and for manned mission to [[Near-Earth object#Near-Earth asteroids|near-Earth asteroids]]). In 2010, spacecraft transfer trajectories to Sun\u2013Earth {{L3|nolink=yes}} were studied and several designs were considered.<ref name=\"transferslibthree\">{{Cite journal|title=Spacecraft trajectories to the {{L3|nolink=yes}} point of the Sun\u2013Earth three-body problem |journal=Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy |last1=Tantardini|first1=Marco |last2=Fantino|first2=Elena |first3=Yuan |last3=Ren |first4=Pierpaolo |last4=Pergola |first5=Gerard |last5=G\u00f3mez |first6=Josep J. |last6=Masdemont |url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10569-010-9299-x |date=2010}}</ref>\n\nMissions to Lagrangian points generally orbit the points rather than occupy them directly.\n\nAnother interesting and useful property of the collinear Lagrangian points and their associated Lissajous orbits is that they serve as \"gateways\" to control the chaotic trajectories of the [[Interplanetary Transport Network]].\n\n===Earth\u2013Moon===\nEarth\u2013Moon {{L1|nolink=yes}} allows comparatively easy access to Lunar and Earth orbits with minimal change in velocity and this has as an advantage to position a half-way manned space station intended to help transport cargo and personnel to the Moon and back.\n\nEarth\u2013Moon {{L2|nolink=yes}} would be a good location for a [[communications satellite]] covering the Moon's far side and would be \"an ideal location\" for a [[propellant depot]] as part of the proposed depot-based space transportation architecture.<ref name=\"aiaa20100902_p4\">{{cite web | last=Zegler|first=Frank |title=Evolving to a Depot-Based Space Transportation Architecture |url=http://www.ulalaunch.com/uploads/docs/Published_Papers/Exploration/DepotBasedTransportationArchitecture2010.pdf |work=AIAA SPACE 2010 Conference & Exposition |publisher=AIAA |accessdate=2011-01-25 |first2=Bernard |last2=Kutter  |date=2010-09-02 |page=4 |quote=L<sub>2</sub> is in deep space far away from any planetary surface and hence the thermal, micrometeoroid, and atomic oxygen environments are vastly superior to those in LEO.
