For example, [[Absolute Radio]] is simulcast on both AM and on [[satellite radio]],<ref name=\"Absolute Radio launch\">{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=62526&d=254&h=5&f=3/|title=Absolute Radio signs exclusive Sony Ericsson ad deal|last=Parry|first=Caroline|date=18 September 2008|accessdate=18 September 2008|work=Marketing Week}}</ref><ref name=\"Absolute Radio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/842893/Plans-revealed-rebrand-Virgin-Radio-Absolute/|title=Plans revealed to rebrand Virgin Radio as Absolute|last=Barnett|first=Emma|date=1 September 2008|accessdate=1 September 2008|work=Brand Republic| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080907014531/http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/842893/Plans-revealed-rebrand-Virgin-Radio-Absolute/| archivedate= 7 September 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> and the [[BBC]]'s [[The Proms|Prom]] [[concert]]s were formerly simulcast on both [[BBC Radio 3]] and [[BBC Television]]. Another application is the transmission of the original-language [[soundtrack]] of movies or TV series over local or [[Internet radio]], with the television broadcast having been [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] into a local language.\n\n==Simulcasting to provide stereo sound for TV broadcasts==\nBefore stereo TV sound transmission was possible, simulcasting on TV and Radio was a method of effectively transmitting \"stereo\" sound to music TV broadcasts. In the 1970s [[WPXI]] in Pittsburgh broadcast a live Boz Scaggs performance which had the audio simultaneously broadcast on two FM radio stations to create a quadrophonic sound, the first of its kind. The first such transmission was in 1975, when the BBC broadcast a recording of [[Van Morrison]]'s London Rainbow Concert simultaneously on BBC2 TV and Radio 2 (see ''[[It's Too Late to Stop Now]]'').\n\nSimilarly, in the 1980s, before Multichannel Television Sound, or home theater was commonplace in American households, broadcasters would air a high fidelity version of a television program's audio portion over FM stereo simultaneous with the television broadcast. PBS stations were the most likely, especially when airing a live concert. It was also a way of allowing [[MTV]] and similar music channels to run stereo sound through the cable-TV network. This method required a stereo FM transmitter modulating MTV's stereo soundtrack through the cable-TV network and customers connecting their FM receiver's antenna input to the cable-TV outlet. Then they would tune the FM receiver to the specified frequency that would be published in documentation supplied by the cable-TV provider.\n\nWith the introduction of commercial FM stations in Australia in July 1980, commercial TV channels began simulcasting some music based programs with the new commercial FM stations and continued to do so into the early 1990s.  These were initially rock based programs, such as late night music video shows and rock concerts, but later included some major rock musicals such as [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]] and [[The Blues Brothers]] when they first aired on TV. During the mid 1980s the final Australian concert of several major rock artists such as Dire Straits were simulcast live on a commercial TV and FM station.  The ABC also simulcast some programs on ABC Television and [[ABC Classic FM|ABC FM]], including the final concert of [[Elton John]] with the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]].\n\nThe first ever concert \"simulcast\" was [[Frank Zappa]]'s Halloween shows (October 31, 1981), live from NYC's Palladium and shown on MTV with the audio-only portion simulcast over the FM \"Starfleet Radio\" network. Engineered by Mark Pinske with the UMRK mobile recording truck. A later, notable application for simulcasting in this context was the [[Live Aid]] telethon concert that was broadcast around the world on July 13, 1985. Most destinations where this concert was broadcast had the concert simulcast by at least one TV network and at least one of the local FM stations.\n\nMost stereo-capable video recorders made through the 1980s and early 1990s had a \"simulcast\" recording mode where they recorded video signals from the built-in TV tuner and audio signals from the VCR's audio line-in connectors. This was to allow one to connect a stereo FM tuner that is tuned to the simulcast frequency to the VCR's audio input in order to record the stereo sound of a TV program that would otherwise be recorded in mono. The function was primarily necessary with stereo VCRs that didn't have a stereo TV tuner or were operated in areas where stereo TV broadcasting wasn't in place. This was typically selected through the user setting the input selector to \"Simulcast\" or \"Radio\" mode or, in the case of some JVC units, the user setting another \"audio input\" switch from \"TV\" or \"Tuner\" to \"Line\".\n\nIn the mid to late 1990s, video game developer [[Nintendo]] utilized simulcasting to provide enhanced [[orchestral]] scoring and voice-acting for the first ever \"integrated radio-games\"<ref name=bsz1worldfirst>{{cite video game| title = [http://www.f3.dion.ne.jp/~kameb/satella/st_kbn/n58.htm#eb BS-X: Sore wa Namae o Nusumareta Machi no Monogatari]| developer = [[Nintendo]]| publisher = [[Nintendo]]/[[St.GIGA]]| date = February 13, 1995| platform = [[Satellaview]]| version = 1995/8/8| language = Japanese| isolang = ja| quote = '''Kabe shinbunsha''': \uff18\u6708\uff16\u65e5\uff08\u65e5\uff09\u3001\u4e16\u754c\u521d\u306e\u30b8\u30aa\uff0f\u30b2\u30fc\u52d5\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u300c\uff22\uff33\u30bc\u30eb\u30c0\u306e\u4f1d\u8aac\u300d\u304c\u5927\u597d\u8a55\u306b\u3064\u304d\uff19\u6708\u306e\u518d\u653e\u9001\u304c\u3064\u3044\u306b\u6c7a\u5b9a\u3057\u305f\u3002}}</ref> \u2013 its [[Satellaview]] video games. Whereas digital game data was broadcast to the Satellaview unit to provide the basic game and game sounds, Nintendo's partner, satellite radio company [[St.GIGA]], simultaneously broadcast the musical and vocal portion of the game via radio. These two streams were combined at the Satellaview to provide a unified audiotrack analogous to stereo.<ref>\"Satellaview: juegos desde el espacio.\" ''Atomicx''. pp.54-57. July 2009.</ref>\n\n==Other uses==\nThe term \"simulcast\" (describing simultaneous radio/television broadcast) was coined in 1948 by a press agent at WCAU-TV, Philadelphia.<ref>John Crosby, \"Television Headache in Etymology,\" Oakland (CA) Tribune, 15 June 1948.</ref> NBC and CBS had begun broadcasting a few programs both to their established nationwide radio audience and to the much smaller\u2014though steadily-growing\u2014television audience. NBC's \"Voice of Firestone\" was an early example. Toscanini's NBC Symphony performance of 15 March 1952 is perhaps a first instance of radio/TV simulcasting of a concert, predating the much-heralded rock concert simulcasts beginning in the 1980s.\n\nPresently, in the United States, simulcast most often refers to the practice of offering the same programming on an FM and AM station owned by the same entity, in order to cut costs. With the advent of solid state AM transmitters and computers, it has become very easy for AM stations to broadcast a different format without additional cost; therefore, simulcast between FM/AM combinations are rarely heard today outside of rural areas, and in urban areas, where often the talk or [[all-news radio]] format of an AM station is simulcast on FM, mainly for the convenience of office buildings in urban cores which easily block AM signals.\n\nDuring [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]], many foreign programmes on [[South African Broadcasting Corporation|SABC]] [[Television in South Africa|television]] were dubbed in [[Afrikaans]]. The original soundtrack, usually in [[English language|English]], but sometimes in [[German language|German]] or [[Dutch language|Dutch]] was available on the Radio 2000 service.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-NRDAQAAIAAJ&dq=was+simulcast++Radio+2000+afrikaans&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Radio+2000+afrikaans ''The voice, the vision: a sixty year history of the South African Broadcasting Corporation''], Malcolm Theunissen, Victor Nikitin, Melanie Pillay, Advent Graphics, 1996, page 120</ref> This could be selected using a button labeled simulcast on many televisions manufactured before 1995.\n\nRadio programs have been simulcast on television since the invention thereof however, as of recent, perhaps the most visible example of radio shows on television is ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', which currently airs on [[Howard 100 and Howard 101|Sirius Satellite Radio]] as well as [[Howard Stern television shows#Howard Stern On Demand|Howard TV]]. Another prominent radio show that was simulcast on television is ''[[Imus in the Morning]]'', which until the simulcast ended in 2015, aired throughout the years on [[MSNBC]], [[RFD-TV]] and [[Fox Business Network]], in addition to its radio broadcast distributed by [[Cumulus Media Networks|Citadel Media]]. Multiple [[sports talk]] radio shows, including ''[[Mike & Mike]]'', ''[[The Herd with Colin Cowherd]]'' and ''[[Boomer and Carton]]'' also are carried on television, saving those networks the burden of having to air encores of sporting events or other paid sports programming which may draw lower audiences.\n\nIn [[professional wrestling]], a simulcast happened on March 26, 2001 between ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Raw is War]]'' and ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' upon WWE's purchase of WCW's assets to merge the storylines of the two [[professional wrestling promotion|wrestling promotion]]s, which was the last episode of ''Monday Nitro''.\n\nIn another case, popular programs will be aired simultaneously on different services in adjacent countries, such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', airing Sunday evenings at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. (Eastern and Pacific times) on both [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the [[United States]] and [[Global Television Network|Global]] in [[Canada]]. \"Simulcast\" is often a colloquial term for the related Canadian practice of [[simultaneous substitution]] (simsub).\n\nSimulcasts are also used for the purposes of [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]], mainly with awards ceremonies such as the [[MTV Video Music Awards]] and the [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]] where the ceremony airs on other sister channels in the same corporate family. These allow a bulk ratings number to be competed which allows for more homes to be calculated in a final rating, along with removing any in-house competition, with each of the networks carrying the same ceremony and same advertising. Another example is a \"roadblock strategy\", where a family of networks will air the premiere of a new series, music video or other event such as a [[telethon]] at the same time to maximize their audiences. During major breaking news events, a simulcast of the Fox News Channel is aired on the Fox broadcast network and Fox Business Network.\n\n\"Live Simulcast\" is also used throughout South America for a real-time live broadcasting from the USA, where it differs from just a live broadcasting in that, on the former case, the event is being broadcast live while it is happening in real time (e.g. the NFL games), while, the latter,  a show may be a live recording but not necessarily being broadcast in real time of when the event took place (e.g. a live concert recording). Yet, local live productions (soccer games, for instance) being broadcast in real time in South America are often just called live, without the use of the word simulcast.\n\n===Simulcasting of sporting events===\nIn sports, such as American football and baseball, simulcasts are when a single announcer broadcasts [[Sports commentator|play-by-play]] coverage both over television and radio. The practice was common in the early years of television, but since the 1980s, most teams have used a separate team for television and for radio.\n\nAs all [[National Football League|NFL]] television broadcasts are done by the national networks or via cable, there are no regular TV-to-radio football simulcasts.  However, NFL rules require that games airing on cable and satellite networks ([[ESPN]], [[NFL Network]]) be simulcast on local over-air TV stations in markets serving the two local teams participating in each game.\n\nSimilarly, no current [[National Basketball Association]] teams use a simulcast. [[Al McCoy (announcer)|Al McCoy]] ([[Phoenix Suns|Phoenix]]), [[Chick Hearn]] ([[Los Angeles Lakers|Los Angeles]]), [[Kevin Calabro]] ([[Seattle SuperSonics|Seattle]]) and [[Rod Hundley]] ([[Utah Jazz|Utah]]) were the last NBA team broadcasters to simulcast.\n\nIn [[Major League Baseball]], only [[Vin Scully]] continues the practice; however, he simulcasts only the first three innings of [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] games at [[Dodger Stadium]] and other [[National League]] Western Division parks.\n\nThe practice is more prevalent in the [[National Hockey League]] where two teams currently simulcast:\n*The [[Buffalo Sabres]] with [[Rick Jeanneret]] and [[Rob Ray]]\n*The [[Dallas Stars]] with [[Ralph Strangis]] and [[Daryl Reaugh]] (popularly known as \"Ralph and Razor\")\n\nSimulcasts via [[communications satellite|satellite]] can be a challenge, as there is a significant [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]] because of the [[distance]] - nearly {{convert|50000|mi|km}} round-trip - involved. Anything involving [[Data compression#Video|video compression]] (and to some extent [[Data compression#Audio|audio data compression]]) also has an additional significant delay, which is noticeable when watching local [[Television station|TV station]]s on [[direct-broadcast satellite]]s. Even though the process is not instantaneous, this is still considered a simulcast because it is not intentionally stored anywhere.\n\n([[Multiplexing]]\u2014also sometimes called \"multicasting\"\u2014is something of a reversal of this situation, where multiple program streams are combined into a single broadcast. The two terms are sometimes confused.)\n\nIn [[horse racing]], a simulcast is a broadcast of a horse race which allows [[gambling|wagering]] at two or more sites; the simulcast often involves the transmission of wagering information to a central site, so that all bettors may bet in the same [[betting pool]], as well as the broadcast of the race.\n\nThe [[San Francisco Giants]] simulcast with the [[Oakland Athletics]] while playing each other on their respective stations and commercials with a mix of [[Presenter|broadcasters]] from both teams.\n\nOn [[cable television]] systems, analog-digital simulcasting (ADS) means that analog channels are duplicated as [[digital subchannel]]s. Digital tuners are programmed to use the digital subchannel instead of the analog. This allows for smaller, cheaper cable boxes by eliminating the analog tuner and some analog circuitry. On [[Digital video recorder|DVR]]s, it eliminates the need for an [[Moving Picture Experts Group|MPEG]] encoder to convert the analog signal to digital for recording. The primary advantage is the elimination of interference, and as analog channels are dropped, the ability to put 10 or more [[Standard-definition television|SDTV]] (or two [[High-definition television|HDTV]], or various other combinations) channels in its place. The primary drawback is the common problem of over-compression (quantity over quality) resulting in fuzzy pictures and [[pixelation]].\n\nIn [[University|universities]] with multiple campuses, simulcasting may be used for a single teacher to teach class to students in two or more locations at the same time, using [[videoconferencing]] equipment.\n\nIn many public safety agencies, simulcast refers to the broadcasting of the same transmission on the same frequency from multiple towers either simultaneously, or offset by a fixed number of microseconds. This allows for a larger coverage area without the need for a large number of channels, resulting in increased [[spectral efficiency]]. This comes at the cost of overall poorer voice quality, as multiple sources increase [[multipath interference]] significantly, resulting in what is called simulcast distortion.\n\nWith some of the latest Simulcast control equipment for FM radio networks, the distortion experienced is almost in-audible to the human ear. With the introduction of Line Equalisation Modules and Tone Generation Modules, the phasing advance and retard is so well calculated that the distortion is almost entirely averted.\n\nThe Tone Generation Module (or TGM) generates a pilot tone at 3300&nbsp;Hz which is then sampled by the Line Equalisation Module (or LEM) which each channel on each radio high site has 2 of located back at the main control site. This then determines the phase shift in the signal and adjusts the transmission accordingly such that all the overlap areas in transmission are in phase with each other.\n<!-- ===Streaming of Japanese content on the internet===\nIn the [[anime industry]], ''simulcast'' has come to mean Japanese animated TV shows that are streamed online with English subtitles for viewers outside of Japan within approximately 24 hours of the original Japanese broadcast. The term has also sometimes been used to mean shows streamed in this way several days after the original broadcast. Anime \"simulcasts\" are made possible by agreements between Japanese anime studios and American companies such as [[CrunchyRoll]], [[FUNimation]], [[Viz Media]], [[Hulu]], or the Australian company [[AnimeLab]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/lexicon.php?id=121 | title = Simulcast - Anime News Network | accessdate = 2013-02-19 | publisher = [[Anime News Network]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =http://flowtv.org/2010/07/niche-market-global-scale/ | title =Niche Market, Global Scale: Simulcasting Anime Online | accessdate = 2013-02-19 | last =Landa | first =Amanda | date =2010-07-02 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art171369.asp | title =What Is Simulcasting? - Anime | accessdate = 2013-02-19 | last =Aeschliman | first =Lesley}}</ref> -->\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Single Channel Simulcast]]\n* [[List of United States anime simulcasts]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Broadcast engineering]]\n[[Category:Radio terminology]]\n[[Category:Television terminology]]\n[[Category:Simulcasts| ]]\n[[Category:Words coined in the 1940s]]"}]}}}}
