It acts exclusively as a [[Flip-flop (electronics)|bistable]] switch, conducting when the gate receives a current trigger, and continuing to conduct while the voltage across the device is not reversed (forward-biased). A three-lead thyristor is designed to control the larger current of its two leads by combining that current with the smaller current of its other lead, known as its control lead. In contrast, a two-lead thyristor is designed to switch on if the potential difference between its leads is sufficiently large (breakdown voltage).\n\nSome sources define [[silicon-controlled rectifier]] (SCR) and thyristor as synonymous.<ref>Christiansen, Donald; Alexander, Charles K. (2005); ''Standard Handbook of Electrical Engineering (5th ed.)''. McGraw-Hill, ISBN 0-07-138421-9</ref> Other sources define thyristors as a larger set of devices with at least four layers of alternating N and P-type material.\n\nThe first thyristor devices were released commercially in 1956. Because thyristors can control a relatively large amount of power and voltage with a small device, they find wide application in control of electric power, ranging from [[light dimmer]]s and electric motor speed control to [[high-voltage direct current]] power transmission. Thyristors may be used in power-switching circuits, relay-replacement circuits, inverter circuits, oscillator circuits, level-detector circuits, chopper circuits, light-dimming circuits, low-cost timer circuits, logic circuits, speed-control circuits, phase-control circuits, etc.  Originally, thyristors relied only on current reversal to turn them off, making them difficult to apply for direct current; newer device types can be turned on and off through the control gate signal.  The latter is known as a [[gate turn-off thyristor]], or GTO thyristor.  A thyristor is not a proportional device like a [[transistor]]. In other words, a thyristor can only be fully on or off, while a transistor can lie in between on and off states. This makes a thyristor unsuitable as an analog amplifier, but useful as a switch.\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe thyristor is a four-layered, three terminal semiconductor device, with each layer consisting of alternately [[N-type semiconductor|N-type]] or [[P-type semiconductor|P-type]] material, for example P-N-P-N. The main terminals, labelled anode and cathode, are across all four layers. The control terminal, called the gate, is attached to p-type material near the cathode. (A variant called an SCS\u2014Silicon Controlled Switch\u2014brings all four layers out to terminals.) The operation of a thyristor can be understood in terms of a pair of tightly coupled [[bipolar junction transistor]]s, arranged to cause a self-latching action:\n:[[File:thyristor.svg|thumb|center|600px|Structure on the physical and electronic level, and the thyristor symbol.]]\nThyristors have three states:\n# Reverse blocking mode \u2014 Voltage is applied in the direction that would be blocked by a diode\n# Forward blocking mode \u2014 Voltage is applied in the direction that would cause a diode to conduct, but the thyristor has not been triggered into conduction\n# Forward conducting mode \u2014 The thyristor has been triggered into conduction and will remain conducting until the forward current drops below a threshold value known as the \"holding current\"\n\n=== Function of the gate terminal ===\nThe thyristor has three [[p-n junction]]s (serially named J<sub>1</sub>, J<sub>2</sub>, J<sub>3</sub> from the anode).\n[[File:Thyristor layers.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|right|Layer diagram of thyristor.]]\nWhen the anode is at a positive potential V<sub>AK</sub> with respect to the cathode with no voltage applied at the gate, junctions J<sub>1</sub> and J<sub>3</sub> are forward biased, while junction J<sub>2</sub> is reverse biased. As J<sub>2</sub> is reverse biased, no conduction takes place (Off state). Now if ''V''<sub>AK</sub> is increased beyond the breakdown voltage ''V''<sub>BO</sub> of the thyristor, [[avalanche breakdown]] of J<sub>2</sub> takes place and the thyristor starts conducting (On state).\n\nIf a positive potential ''V''<sub>G</sub> is applied at the gate terminal with respect to the cathode, the breakdown of the junction J<sub>2</sub> occurs at a lower value of ''V''<sub>AK</sub>. By selecting an appropriate value of ''V''<sub>G</sub>, the thyristor can be switched into the on state quickly.\n\nOnce avalanche breakdown has occurred, the thyristor continues to conduct, irrespective of the gate voltage, until: (a) the potential ''V''<sub>AK</sub> is removed or (b) the current through the device (anode\u2212cathode) is less than the holding current specified by the manufacturer. Hence ''V''<sub>G</sub> can be a voltage pulse, such as the voltage output from a [[UJT]] [[relaxation oscillator]].\n\nThe gate pulses are characterized in terms of gate trigger voltage (''V''<sub>GT</sub>) and gate trigger current (''I''<sub>GT</sub>). Gate trigger current varies inversely with gate pulse width in such a way that it is evident that there is a minimum gate [[electric charge|charge]] required to trigger the thyristor.\n\n=== Switching characteristics ===\n[[File:Thyristor I-V diagram.svg|thumb|right|''V'' \u2013 ''I'' characteristics.]]\nIn a conventional thyristor, once it has been switched on by the gate terminal, the device remains latched in the on-state (''i.e.'' does not need a continuous supply of gate current to remain in the on state), providing the anode current has exceeded the latching current (''I''<sub>L</sub>). As long as the anode remains positively biased, it cannot be switched off until the anode current falls below the holding current (''I''<sub>H</sub>). In normal working condition the latching current is always greater than holding current. In the above figure ''I''<sub>L</sub>  ''has to come above the I''<sub>H</sub> ''on y-axis since  I''<sub>L</sub>  ''> I''<sub>H.</sub>\n\nA thyristor can be switched off if the external circuit causes the anode to become negatively biased (a method known as natural, or line, commutation). In some applications this is done by switching a second thyristor to discharge a capacitor into the cathode of the first thyristor. This method is called forced commutation.\n\nAfter the current in a thyristor has extinguished, a finite time delay must elapse before the anode can again be positively biased ''and'' retain the thyristor in the off-state. This minimum delay is called the circuit commutated turn off time (''t''<sub>Q</sub>). Attempting to positively bias the anode within this time causes the thyristor to be self-triggered by the remaining charge carriers ([[Electron hole|holes]] and [[electron]]s) that have not yet [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombined]].\n\nFor applications with frequencies higher than the domestic AC mains supply (e.g. 50&nbsp;Hz or 60&nbsp;Hz), thyristors with lower values of ''t''<sub>Q</sub> are required. Such fast thyristors can be made by diffusing [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] [[ion]]s such as [[gold]] or [[platinum]] which act as charge combination centers into the silicon. Today, fast thyristors are more usually made by [[electron]] or [[proton]] [[irradiation]] of the silicon, or by [[ion implantation]].  Irradiation is more versatile than heavy metal doping because it permits the dosage to be adjusted in fine steps, even at quite a late stage in the processing of the silicon.\n\n== History ==\nThe silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) or thyristor proposed by [[William Shockley]] in 1950 and championed by Moll and others at [[Bell Labs]] was developed in 1956 by power engineers at [[General Electric]] (G.E.), led by Gordon Hall and commercialized by G.E.'s Frank W. \"Bill\" Gutzwiller.\n\n[[File:Nelson Bipole Thyristors.jpg|thumb|260px|A bank of six 2000 A thyristors (white disks arranged in a row at top, and seen edge-on)]]\n\n=== Etymology ===\nAn earlier [[gas filled tube]] device called a [[thyratron]] provided a similar electronic switching capability, where a small control voltage could switch a large current. It is from a combination of \"thyratron\" and \"[[transistor]]\" that the term \"thyristor\" is derived.<ref>[http://home.roadrunner.com/~mathematikos/Etymology/thyristor.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905132123/http://home.roadrunner.com/~mathematikos/Etymology/thyristor.pdf |date=September 5, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:Regulated rectifier.gif|thumb|right|Waveforms in a thyristor circuit controlling an AC current.<br />Red trace: load (output) voltage<br />Blue trace: trigger voltage.]]\nThyristors are mainly used where high currents and voltages are involved, and are often used to control [[alternating current]]s, where the change of polarity of the current causes the device to switch off automatically, referred to as \"[[zero cross circuit|zero cross]]\" operation. The device can be said to operate ''synchronously''; being that, once the device is triggered, it conducts current in phase with the voltage applied over its cathode to anode junction with no further gate modulation being required, i.e., the device is biased ''fully on''. This is not to be confused with asymmetrical operation, as the output is unidirectional, flowing only from cathode to anode, and so is asymmetrical in nature.\n\nThyristors can be used as the control elements for phase angle triggered controllers, also known as [[phase fired controllers]].\n\nThey can also be found in power supplies for [[digital electronics|digital circuits]], where they are used as a sort of \"enhanced [[circuit breaker]]\" to prevent a failure in the power supply from damaging downstream components. A thyristor is used in conjunction with a [[Zener diode]] attached to its gate, and if the output voltage of the supply rises above the Zener voltage, the thyristor will conduct and short-circuit the power supply output to ground (in general also tripping an upstream breaker or [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]]). This kind of protection circuit is known as a [[Crowbar (circuit)|crowbar]], and has the advantage over a standard circuit breaker or fuse in that it creates a high-conductance path to ground for the damaging supply voltage and potentially for stored energy in the system being powered.\n\nThe first large-scale application of thyristors, with associated triggering [[diac]], in consumer products related to stabilized power supplies within color [[television]] receivers in the early 1970s.{{clarify|reason=Verb missing. 'DIAC' or 'DIACs'? Etc.|date=April 2015}}  The stabilized high voltage DC supply for the receiver was obtained by moving the switching point of the thyristor device up and down the falling slope of the positive going half of the AC supply input (if the rising slope was used the output voltage would always rise towards the peak input voltage when the device was triggered and thus defeat the aim of regulation). The precise switching point was determined by the load on the DC output supply, as well as AC input fluctuations.\n\nThyristors have been used for decades as [[dimmer|lighting dimmers]], in [[television]], [[motion picture]]s, and [[theater]], where they replaced inferior technologies such as [[autotransformer]]s and [[rheostat]]s. They have also been used in photography as a critical part of flashes (strobes).\n\n=== Snubber circuits ===\nThyristors can be triggered by a high rise-rate of off-state voltage. This is prevented by connecting a [[resistor]]-[[capacitor]] (RC) [[snubber]] circuit between the anode and cathode  in order to limit the dV/dt (i.e., rate of voltage change over time).\n\n=== HVDC electricity transmission ===\n[[File:Manitoba Hydro-BipoleII Valve.jpg|thumb|[[Valve hall]] containing thyristor valve stacks used for long-distance transmission of power from [[Manitoba Hydro]] dams]]\nSince modern thyristors can switch power on the scale of [[megawatt]]s, thyristor valves have become the heart of [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) conversion either to or from alternating current. In the realm of this and other very high-power applications, both electrically triggered (ETT) and light-triggered (LTT) thyristors<ref>{{cite book| url=http://www.siemens.co.in/pool/about_us/our_business_segments/hvdc_proven_technology.pdf | title=High Voltage Direct Current Transmission \u2013 Proven Technology for Power Exchange | publisher=[[Siemens]] | chapter=Chapter 5.1| accessdate=2013-08-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://library.e.abb.com/public/3c981b9078f55447c1256feb0022602a/ETT%20vs%20LTT.pdf|title=ETT vs. LTT for HVDC | publisher=[[ABB Asea Brown Boveri]]|accessdate=2014-01-24}}</ref> are still the primary choice. The valves are arranged in stacks usually suspended from the ceiling of a transmission building called a [[valve hall]]. Thyristors are arranged into a [[diode bridge]] circuit and to reduce harmonics are connected in series to form a 12-pulse converter. Each thyristor is cooled with [[Distilled water#Deionization|deionized water]], and the entire arrangement becomes one of multiple identical modules forming a layer in a multilayer valve stack called a ''quadruple valve''. Three such stacks are typically mounted on the floor or hung from the ceiling of the valve hall of a long-distance transmission facility.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.abb.com/cawp/gad02181/c1256d71001e0037c12568320068995e.aspx |title=HVDC Thyristor Valves |publisher=[[ABB Asea Brown Boveri]] |accessdate=2008-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122071434/http://www.abb.com/cawp/gad02181/c1256d71001e0037c12568320068995e.aspx |archivedate=January 22, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://kn.theiet.org/magazine/issues/0809/high-power.cfm |title=High Power |publisher=[[Institution of Engineering and Technology|IET]] |accessdate=2009-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910162625/http://kn.theiet.org/magazine/issues/0809/high-power.cfm |archivedate=September 10, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== Comparisons to other devices ==\nThe functional drawback of a thyristor is that, like a diode, it only conducts in one direction. A similar self-latching 5-layer device, called a [[TRIAC]], is able to work in both directions. This added capability, though, also can become a shortfall. Because the TRIAC can conduct in both directions, [[Reactance (electronics)|reactive]] loads can cause it to fail to turn off during the zero-voltage instants of the [[Alternating current|AC]] power cycle. Because of this, use of TRIACs with (for example) heavily [[inductance|inductive]] motor loads usually requires the use of a \"[[snubber]]\" circuit around the TRIAC to assure that it will turn off with each half-cycle of mains power. [[Antiparallel (electronics)|Inverse parallel]] SCRs can also be used in place of the triac; because each SCR in the pair has an entire half-cycle of reverse polarity applied to it, the SCRs, unlike TRIACs, are sure to turn off. The \"price\" to be paid for this arrangement, however, is the added complexity of two separate, but essentially identical gating circuits.\n\nAlthough thyristors are heavily used in megawatt-scale [[rectifier|rectification]] of AC to DC, in low- and medium-power (from few tens of watts to few tens of kilowatts) applications they have virtually been replaced by other devices with superior switching characteristics like [[Power MOSFET]]s or [[IGBT]]s. One major problem associated with SCRs is that they are not fully controllable switches. The [[Gate turn-off thyristor|GTO thyristor]] and [[IGCT]] are two devices related to the thyristor that address this problem. In high-frequency applications, thyristors are poor candidates due to large switching times arising from bipolar conduction. MOSFETs, on the other hand, have much faster switching capability because of their unipolar conduction (only [[majority carriers]] carry the current).\n\n== Failure modes ==\nThyristor manufacturers generally specify a region of safe firing defining acceptable levels of voltage and current for a given [[operating temperature]]. The boundary of this region is partly determined by the requirement that the maximum permissible gate power (P<sub>G</sub>), specified for a given trigger pulse duration, is not exceeded.<ref>[http://www.powerguru.org/2012/05/09/safe-firing-of-thyristors/ ''\"Safe Firing of Thyristors\"''] on powerguru.org</ref>\n\nAs well as the usual failure modes due to exceeding voltage, current or power ratings, thyristors have their own particular modes of failure, including:\n* '''Turn on di/dt''' \u2014 in which the rate of rise of on-state current after triggering is higher than can be supported by the spreading speed of the active conduction area (SCRs & triacs).\n* '''Forced commutation''' \u2014 in which the transient peak reverse recovery current causes such a high voltage drop in the sub-cathode region that it exceeds the reverse breakdown voltage of the gate cathode diode junction (SCRs only).\n* '''Switch on dv/dt''' \u2014 the thyristor can be spuriously fired without trigger from the gate if the anode-to-cathode voltage rise-rate is too great.\n\n== Silicon carbide thyristors ==\nIn recent years, some manufacturers<ref>Example: [http://powerelectronics.com/news/silicon-carbide-inverter/ ''Silicon Carbide Inverter Demonstrates Higher Power Output''] in Power Electronics Technology (2006-02-01)</ref> have developed thyristors using [[silicon carbide]] (SiC) as the semiconductor material.

These devices are advantageous where a reverse or freewheel diode must be used. Because the [[Silicon-controlled rectifier|SCR]] and [[diode]] never conduct at the same time they do not produce heat simultaneously and can easily be integrated and cooled together. Reverse conducting thyristors are often used in [[frequency changer]]s and [[Inverter (electrical)|inverters]].\n\n=== Photothyristors ===\n[[File:LASCRsymbol.png|100px|thumb|[[Electronic symbol]] for light-activated SCR (LASCR)]]\nPhotothyristors are activated by light. The advantage of photothyristors is their insensitivity to electrical signals, which can cause faulty operation in electrically noisy environments. A light-triggered thyristor (LTT) has an optically sensitive region in its gate, into which [[electromagnetic radiation]] (usually [[infrared]]) is coupled by an [[optical fiber]].  Since no electronic boards need to be provided at the potential of the thyristor in order to trigger it, light-triggered thyristors can be an advantage in high-voltage applications such as [[HVDC]].  Light-triggered thyristors are available with in-built over-voltage (VBO) protection, which triggers the thyristor when the forward voltage across it becomes too high;  they have also been made with in-built ''forward recovery protection'', but not commercially. Despite the simplification they can bring to the electronics of an HVDC valve, light-triggered thyristors may still require some simple monitoring electronics and are only available from a few manufacturers.\n\nTwo common photothyristors include the light-activated [[Silicon controlled rectifier|SCR]] (LASCR) and the light-activated [[TRIAC]]. A LASCR acts as a switch that turns on when exposed to light. Following light exposure, when light is absent, if the power is not removed and the polarities of the cathode and anode have not yet reversed, the LASCR is still in the \"on\" state. A light-activated TRIAC resembles a LASCR, except that it is designed for alternating currents.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Latchup]]\n* [[Quadrac]]\n* [[Thyristor drive]]\n* [[Thyristor tower]]\n* [[Thyratron]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book |last1=Wintrich |first1= Arendt|last2= Nicolai|first2= Ulrich|last3= Tursky|first3= Werner|last4= Reimann|first4= Tobias|title= Application Manual Power Semiconductors 2011|url= http://www.semikron.com/download/assets/pdf/application_handbook/application_manual_complete.pdf|format=PDF|edition= 2nd|year= 2011|publisher= Semikron|location= Nuremberg|isbn= 978-3-938843-66-6}}\n* ''Thyristor Theory and Design Considerations''; ON Semiconductor; 240 pages; 2006; HBD855/D. <small>[http://www.onsemi.com/pub_link/Collateral/HBD855-D.PDF (Free PDF download)]</small>\n* Ulrich Nicolai, Tobias Reimann, J\u00fcrgen Petzoldt, Josef Lutz: ''Application Manual IGBT and MOSFET Power Modules'', 1.
