The frequencies between a stopband and a passband define the transition band. ]]\nA '''stopband''' is a [[Band (radio)|band]] of frequencies, between specified limits, through which a [[electrical circuit|circuit]], such as a [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]] or [[telephone]] circuit, does not allow signals to pass, or the [[attenuation]] is above the required stopband attenuation level. Depending on application, the required attenuation within the stopband may typically be a value between 20 and 120 [[decibel|dB]] higher than the nominal passband attenuation, which often is 0&nbsp;dB.\n\nThe lower and upper ''limiting frequencies'', also denoted lower and upper stopband [[corner frequency|corner frequencies]], are the frequencies where the stopband and the [[transition band]]s meet in a filter specification. The stopband of a low-pass filter is the frequencies from the stopband corner frequency (which is slightly higher than the passband 3&nbsp;dB cut-off frequency) up to the infinite frequency. The stopband of a high-pass filter consists of the frequencies from 0 hertz to a stopband corner frequency (slightly lower than the passband cut-off frequency).\n\nA band-stop filter has one stopband, specified by two non-zero and non-infinite corner frequencies. The difference between the limits in the band-stop filter is the stopband [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], which usually is expressed in [[hertz]].\n\nA bandpass filter typically has two stopbands. The shape factor of a bandpass filter is the relationship between the 3&nbsp;dB bandwidth, and the difference between the stopband limits.\n \n== See also ==\n* [[Passband]]\n* [[Band-stop filter]]\n* [[Band gap]] in solid state physics\n* [[Band rejection]]\n\n==References==\n*{{FS1037C MS188}}\n\n[[Category:Filter theory]]\n\n\n{{electronics-stub}}\n{{Telecomm-stub}}\n\n[[sv:Stoppband]]"}]}}}}
