There are presently no chemical syntheses which achieve this aim. Some atomic placement has been achieved with [[scanning tunnelling microscope]]s.\n\n==Introduction==\n\nIn conventional chemical synthesis or [[chemosynthesis]], reactive molecules encounter one another through random thermal motion in a liquid or vapor. In a hypothesized process of mechanosynthesis, reactive [[molecule]]s would be attached to molecular mechanical systems, and their encounters would result from mechanical motions bringing them together in planned sequences, positions, and orientations. It is envisioned that mechanosynthesis would avoid unwanted reactions by keeping potential reactants apart, and would strongly favor desired reactions by holding reactants together in optimal orientations for many molecular [[oscillation|vibration]] cycles. In biology, the [[ribosome]] provides an example of a programmable mechanosynthetic device.\n\nA primitive, very non-biological form of [[mechanochemistry]] has been performed at cryogenic temperatures using [[scanning tunneling microscope]]s. So far, such devices provide the closest approach to fabrication tools for [[molecular engineering]]. Broader exploitation of mechanosynthesis awaits more advanced technology for constructing [[molecular machine]] systems, with ribosome-like systems as an attractive early objective.\n\nMuch of the excitement regarding advanced mechanosynthesis regards its potential use in assembly of [[molecular nanotechnology|molecular-scale devices]]. Such techniques appear to have many applications in medicine, aviation, resource extraction, manufacturing and warfare.\n\nMost theoretical explorations of advanced machines of this kind have focused on using [[carbon]], because of the many strong bonds it can form, the many types of chemistry these bonds permit, and utility of these bonds in medical and mechanical applications. Carbon forms diamond, for example, which if cheaply available, would be an excellent material for many machines.\n\nIt has been suggested, notably by [[K. Eric Drexler]], that mechanosynthesis will be fundamental to molecular manufacturing based on [[nanofactory|nanofactories]] capable of building macroscopic objects with atomic precision. The potential for these has been disputed, notably by [[Nobel prize|Nobel]] Laureate [[Richard Smalley]] (who proposed and then critiqued an unworkable approach based on small fingers).\n\nThe Nanofactory Collaboration,<ref>[http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory Nanofactory Collaboration]. Molecularassembler.com. Retrieved on 2011-07-23.</ref> founded by [[Robert Freitas]] and [[Ralph Merkle]] in 2000, is a focused ongoing effort involving 23 researchers from 10 organizations and 4 countries that is developing a practical research agenda<ref>[http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/Challenges.htm Nanofactory Technical Challenges]. Molecularassembler.com. Retrieved on 2011-07-23.</ref> specifically aimed at positionally controlled diamond mechanosynthesis and diamondoid nanofactory development. \n\nIn practice, getting exactly one molecule to a known place on the microscope's tip is possible, but has proven difficult to automate. Since practical products require at least several hundred million atoms, this technique has not yet proven practical in forming a real product.\n\nThe goal of one line of mechanoassembly research focuses on overcoming these problems by calibration, and selection of appropriate synthesis reactions. Some suggest attempting to develop a specialized, very small (roughly 1,000 nanometers on a side) machine tool that can build copies of itself using mechanochemical means, under the control of an external computer. In the literature, such a tool is called an assembler or molecular assembler. Once assemblers exist, geometric growth (directing copies to make copies) could reduce the cost of assemblers rapidly. Control by an external computer should then permit large groups of assemblers to construct large, useful projects to atomic precision. One such project would combine molecular-level conveyor belts with permanently mounted assemblers to produce a factory.\n\nIn part to resolve this and related questions about the dangers of [[industrial accident]]s and popular fears of runaway events equivalent to [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Bhopal disaster|Bhopal]] disasters, and the more remote issue of [[ecophagy]], [[grey goo]] and green goo (various potential disasters arising from runaway replicators, which could be built using mechanosynthesis) the [[Royal Society|UK Royal Society]] and UK [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] in 2003 commissioned a study to deal with these issues and larger social and ecological implications, led by mechanical engineering professor Ann Dowling. This was anticipated by some to take a strong position on these problems and potentials \u2014\u2013 and suggest any development path to a general theory of so-called mechanosynthesis. However, the [[Royal Society's nanotech report]] did not address molecular manufacturing at all, except to dismiss it along with grey goo.\n\nCurrent technical proposals for nanofactories do not include self-replicating nanorobots, and recent ethical guidelines would prohibit development of unconstrained self-replication capabilities in nanomachines.<ref>[http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/index.html Molecular Nanotechnology Guidelines].

Molecularassembler.com. Retrieved on 2011-07-23.</ref>). \nFor example, the 2006 paper in this continuing research effort by Freitas, Merkle and their collaborators reports that the most-studied mechanosynthesis tooltip motif (DCB6Ge) successfully places a C<sub>2</sub> carbon [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] on a C(110) [[diamond]] surface at both 300 K (room temperature) and 80 K ([[liquid nitrogen]] temperature), and that the silicon variant (DCB6Si) also works at 80 K but not at 300 K. These tooltips are intended to be used only in carefully controlled environments (e.g., vacuum). Maximum acceptable limits for tooltip translational and rotational misplacement errors are reported in paper III\u2014tooltips must be positioned with great accuracy to avoid bonding the dimer incorrectly. Over 100,000 CPU hours were invested in this study. \n\nThe DCB6Ge tooltip motif, initially described at a Foresight Conference in 2002, was the first complete tooltip ever proposed for diamond mechanosynthesis and remains the only tooltip motif that has been successfully simulated for its intended function on a full 200-atom diamond surface. Although an early paper gives a predicted placement speed of 1 dimer per second for this tooltip, this limit was imposed by the slow speed of recharging the tool using an inefficient recharging method<ref name=\"mechanosynthesis71\"/> and is not based on any inherent limitation in the speed of use of a charged tooltip. Additionally, no sensing means was proposed for discriminating among the three possible outcomes of an attempted dimer placement\u2014deposition at the correct location, deposition at the wrong location, and failure to place the dimer at all\u2014because the initial proposal was to position the tooltip by dead reckoning, with the proper reaction assured by designing appropriate chemical energetics and relative bond strengths for the tooltip-surface interaction.\n\nMore recent theoretical work<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.molecularassembler.com/Papers/MinToolset.pdf |title=A Minimal Toolset for Positional Diamond Mechanosynthesis|year=2008|last1=Freitas Jr.|first1=Robert A.|last2=Merkle|first2=Ralph C.|journal=Journal of Computational and Theoretical Nanoscience|volume=5|issue=7|pages=760\u2013861}}</ref> analyzes a complete set of nine molecular tools made from hydrogen, carbon and germanium able to (a) synthesize all tools in the set (b) recharge all tools in the set from appropriate feedstock molecules and (c) synthesize a wide range of stiff hydrocarbons (diamond, graphite, fullerenes, and the like). All required reactions are analyzed using standard ab initio quantum chemistry methods.\n\nFurther research <ref>[http://www.foresight.org/stage2/project1A.html Speeding the development of molecular nanotechnology]. www.foresight.org</ref> to consider alternate tips will require time-consuming [[computational chemistry]] and difficult laboratory work.\nIn the early 2000s, a typical experimental arrangement was to attach a molecule to the tip of an [[atomic force microscope]], and then use the microscope's precise positioning abilities to push the molecule on the tip into another on a substrate. Since the angles and distances can be precisely controlled, and the reaction occurs in a vacuum, novel chemical compounds and arrangements are possible.\n\n==History==\nThe technique of moving single atoms mechanically was proposed by [[Eric Drexler]] in his 1986 book [[The Engines of Creation]].\n\nIn 1988, researchers at [[IBM]]'s Z\u00fcrich Research Institute successfully spelled the letters \"IBM\" in xenon atoms on a cryogenic copper surface, grossly validating the approach. Since then, a number of research projects have undertaken to use similar techniques to store computer data in a compact fashion. More recently the technique has been used to explore novel physical chemistries, sometimes using lasers to excite the tips to particular energy states, or examine the quantum chemistry of particular chemical bonds.\n\nIn 1999, an experimentally proved methodology called [[feature-oriented scanning]]<ref>{{cite journal|author=R.

The feature-oriented scanning methodology allows precisely controlling the position of the probe of a [[scanning probe microscope]] (SPM) on an atomic surface at room temperature. The suggested methodology supports fully automatic control of single- and multiprobe instruments in solving tasks of mechanosynthesis and bottom-up [[nanofabrication]].\n\nIn 2003, Oyabu ''et al.''<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.176102|title=Mechanical Vertical Manipulation of Selected Single Atoms by Soft Nanoindentation Using Near Contact Atomic Force Microscopy|year=2003|last1=Oyabu|first1=Noriaki|last2=Custance|first2=\u00d3Scar|last3=Yi|first3=Insook|last4=Sugawara|first4=Yasuhiro|last5=Morita|first5=Seizo|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=90|issue=17|bibcode = 2003PhRvL..90q6102O }}</ref> reported the first instance of purely mechanical-based covalent bond-making and bond-breaking, i.e., the first experimental demonstration of true mechanosynthesis\u2014albeit with silicon rather than carbon atoms.\n\nIn 2005, the first patent application on diamond mechanosynthesis <ref>Robert A.
