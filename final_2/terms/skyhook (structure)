A heavy [[space station|orbiting station]] is connected to a cable which extends down towards the upper atmosphere. Payloads, which are much lighter than the station, are hooked to the end of the cable as it passes, and are then flung into orbit by rotation of the cable around the centre of mass. The station can then be reboosted to its original altitude by electromagnetic propulsion, rocket propulsion, or by deorbiting another object equal in mass to the payload.\n\nA skyhook differs from a geostationary orbit [[space elevator]] in that a skyhook would be much shorter and would not come in contact with the surface of the Earth. A skyhook would require a suborbital launch vehicle to reach its lower end, while a space elevator would not.\n\n==History==\n\nDifferent synchronous non-rotating orbiting skyhook concepts and versions have been proposed, starting with Isaacs in 1966,<ref>{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 17813792\n| year = 1966\n| author1 = Isaacs\n| first1 = J.

The non-rotating skyhook is a much shorter version that would not touch the surface of the Earth and would be much lighter in mass. It would work by hanging a cable from a relatively low altitude orbit to just above the Earth's atmosphere. Since the lower end of the cable would be moving at less than [[orbital speed|orbital velocity]] for its altitude, a launch vehicle flying to the bottom of the skyhook would  be able to carry a larger payload while being assisted into orbit by the device.<ref name=\"sf.tour\">{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=N. |title=Space Elevators, Space Hotels and Space Tourism |publisher=SpaceFuture.com |date=August 1998 |url=http://www.spacefuture.com/archive/space_elevators_space_hotels_and_space_tourism.shtml }}</ref><ref name=\"asf.home\">{{cite web |last=Sarmont |first=E. |title=Affordable to the Individual Spaceflight |url=http://www.affordablespaceflight.com/home.html |publisher= |date= |archivedate=2007-02-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213093349/http://www.affordablespaceflight.com/home.html |deadurl=yes }}</ref> This type of skyhook would start out as short as 200&nbsp;km and grow to over 4,000&nbsp;km in length using a bootstrap method that would take advantage of the reduction in launch costs that come with increases in tether length.

If the orbital velocity and the tether rotation rate are synchronized, the tether tip moves in a [[cycloid]] curve.

This reduces the required strength of the tether, and makes coupling easier.\n\nThe rotation of the tether can be made to exactly match the orbital speed (around 7\u20138&nbsp;km/s). In this configuration, the hook would trace out a path similar to a [[cardioid]]. From the point of view of the ground, the hook would appear to descend almost vertically, come to a halt, and then ascend again. This configuration minimises aerodynamic drag, and thus allows the hook to descend deep into the atmosphere.<ref name=\"sci.1966\">{{cite journal |first=J. D. |last=Isaacs |first2=A.

This would give the tip a ground speed of 3.6&nbsp;km/s (Mach 10), which would be matched by a hypersonic airplane carrying the payload module, with transfer at an altitude of 100&nbsp;km. The tether would be made of existing commercially available materials: mostly Spectra 2000 (a kind of [[ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]]), except for the outer 20&nbsp;km which would be made of heat-resistant Zylon PBO. With a nominal payload mass of 14 tonnes, the Spectra/Zylon tether would weigh 1300 tonnes, or 90 times the mass of the payload. The authors stated:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe primary message we want to leave with the Reader is: \"We don't need magic materials like 'Buckminster-Fuller-carbon-nanotubes' to make the space tether facility for a HASTOL system. Existing materials will do.\"<ref name=\"Boeing.2000\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nThe second phase of the HASTOL study, published in 2001, proposed increasing the intercept airspeed to Mach 15-17, and increasing the intercept altitude to 150&nbsp;km, which would reduce the necessary tether mass by a factor of three. The higher speed would be achieved by using a reusable rocket stage instead of a purely air-breathing aircraft. The study concluded that although there are no \"fundamental technical show-stoppers\", substantial improvement in technology would be needed. In particular, there was concern that a bare Spectra 2000 tether would be rapidly eroded by atomic oxygen; this component was given a [[technology readiness level]] of 2.<ref name=\"Boeing.2001\">{{cite web |url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/391Grant.pdf |title=Hypersonic Airplane Space Tether Orbital Launch (HASTOL) Architecture Study.
