This construction design is known as ''[[body-on-frame]]''. Over time, nearly all passenger cars have migrated to [[Coachbuilder#Unibody construction|unibody construction]], meaning their chassis and bodywork have been integrated into one another. \n\nNearly all [[truck]]s, buses, and most [[Pickup truck|pickups]] continue to use a separate frame as their chassis.\n\n==Functions==\nThe main functions of a frame in motor vehicles are:<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nBVefxD_0agC&pg=PA409&dq=The+main+functions+of+an+automobile+frame |page=410 |title=A textbook of automobile engineering |first=R.

Notice hat-shaped crossmember in the background, c-shape rails and cross member in center, and a slight arc over the axle.]]\nTypically the material used to construct vehicle chassis and frames is [[Steel#Carbon steels|carbon steel]]; or aluminum alloys to achieve a more light-weight construction. In the case of a separate chassis, the frame is made up of [[structural element]]s called the ''rails'' or [[Beam (structure)|''beams'']]. These are ordinarily made of steel ''channel'' sections, made by folding, rolling or pressing steel plate.\n\nThere are three main designs for these. If the material is folded twice, an open-ended cross-section, either C-shaped or hat-shaped (U-shaped) results.\n\"Boxed\" frames contain chassis rails that are closed, either by somehow welding them up, or by using premanufactured [[Hollow structural section|metal tubing]]\n\n<big>'''C-shape'''</big><br />\nBy far the most common, the C-channel rail has been used on nearly every type of vehicle at one time or another. It is made by taking a flat piece of steel (usually ranging in thickness from 1/8\" to 3/16\") and rolling both sides over to form a c-shaped beam running the length of the vehicle.\n\n<big>'''Hat'''</big><br />\nHat frames resemble a \"U\" and may be either right-side-up or inverted with the open area facing down. Not commonly used due to weakness and a propensity to rust, however they can be found on 1936\u20131954 [[Chevrolet]] cars and some [[Studebaker]]s.\n[[File:Chassis (4689544258).jpg|thumb|High performance custom frame, using boxed rails and tube sections]]\nAbandoned for a while, the hat frame gained popularity again when companies started welding it to the bottom of unibody cars, in effect creating a boxed frame.\n\n<big>'''Boxed'''</big><br />\nOriginally, boxed frames were made by welding two matching C-rails together to form a rectangular tube. Modern techniques, however, use a process similar to making C-rails in that a piece of steel is bent into four sides and then welded where both ends meet.\n\nIn the 1960s, the boxed frames of conventional American cars were spot-welded here and there down the seam; when turned into NASCAR \"stock car\" racers, the box was continuously welded from end to end for extra strength.\n\n===Design features===\n[[File:ToyotaTundraChassis.jpg|right|thumb|Pickup truck chassis holding the vehicle's engine, drivetrain, suspension, and wheels]]\nWhile appearing at first glance as a simple form made of metal, frames encounter great amounts of stress and are built accordingly. The first issue addressed is '''beam height''', or the height of the vertical side of a frame. The taller the frame, the better it is able to resist vertical flex when force is applied to the top of the frame. This is the reason [[truck|semi-trucks]] have taller frame rails than other vehicles instead of just being thicker.\n\nAs looks, ride quality, and handling became more important to consumers, new shapes were incorporated into frames. The most visible of these are arches and kick-ups. Instead of running straight over both [[axle]]s, arched frames sit lower\u2014roughly level with their axles\u2014and curve up over the axles and then back down on the other side for bumper placement. Kick-ups do the same thing, but don't curve down on the other side, and are more common on front ends.\n\nAnother feature seen are tapered rails that narrow vertically and/or horizontally in front of a vehicle's cabin. This is done mainly on trucks to save weight and slightly increase room for the engine since the front of the vehicle does not bear as much of a load as the back. Design developments include frames that use more than one shape in the same frame rail. For example, some pickup trucks have a boxed frame in front of the cab, shorter, narrower rails underneath the cab, and regular C-rails under the bed.\n\nOn ''perimeter'' frames, the areas where the rails connect from front to center and center to rear are weak compared to regular frames, so that section is boxed in, creating what is known as ''torque boxes''.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Ladder frame===\n[[File:Developed ladder chassis with diagonal cross-bracing and lightening holes (Autocar Handbook, 13th ed, 1935).jpg|thumb|Ladder chassis with diagonal cross-bracing and [[lightening holes]]]]\nSo named for its resemblance to a ladder, the ladder frame is one of the simplest and oldest of all designs. It consists of two symmetrical beams, rails, or channels running the length of the vehicle, and several transverse cross-members connecting them. Originally seen on almost all vehicles, the ladder frame was gradually phased out on cars in favor of perimeter frames and unitized body construction. It is now seen mainly on trucks.  This design offers good beam resistance because of its continuous rails from front to rear, but poor resistance to torsion or warping if simple, perpendicular cross-members are used. Also, the vehicle's overall height will be greater due to the [[floor pan]] sitting above the frame instead of inside it.\n\n===Unibody===\nThe term '''unibody''' or '''unit body''' is short for '''unitized body''', or alternatively ''unitary construction'' design. This engineering approach of a vehicle describes \"of a vehicle, a one-piece frame and body structure\"<ref>{{cite web|title=unibody |work=Dictionary.com |url= http://www.dictionary.com/browse/unibody |accessdate=28 March 2016}}</ref> A \"type of body/frame construction in which the body of the vehicle, its floor plan and chassis form a single structure. Such a design is generally lighter and more rigid than a vehicle having a separate body and frame.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=unit body |work=engineering-dictionary.org |url= http://www.engineering-dictionary.org/Unit_body  |accessdate=28 March 2016}}</ref> Traditional [[body-on-frame]] architectures has shifted to the lighter unitized body structure that is now used on most cars.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://wardsauto.com/news-analysis/shift-unitized-body-no-slam-dunk |title=Shift to Unitized Body No Slam Dunk |date=1 September 2008 |first=Bill |last=Visnic |work=Wards Auto |accessdate=28 March 2016}}</ref> The last UK mass-produced car with a separate chassis was the [[Triumph Herald]], which was discontinued in 1971.\n\nIntegral frame and body construction requires more than simply welding an unstressed body to a conventional frame. In a fully integrated body structure, the entire car is a load-carrying unit that handles all the loads experienced by the vehicle\u2014forces from driving as well as cargo loads. Integral-type bodies for wheeled vehicles are typically manufactured by welding preformed metal panels and other components together, by forming or casting whole sections as one piece, or by a combination of these techniques. Although this is sometimes also referred to as a [[monocoque]] structure, because the car's outer skin and panels are made load-bearing, there are also still ribs, bulkheads and box sections to reinforce the body, making the description [[semi-monocoque]] more appropriate.\n\nThe first attempt to develop such a design technique was on the 1922 [[Lancia Lambda]] to provide structural stiffness and a lower body height for its [[Torpedo (car)|torpedo car]] body.<ref name=\"Genta\">{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KxTHBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA23&dq=Probably+the+first+attempt+to+develop+such+an+architecture+was+done+with+the+1922+Lancia+Lambda |pages=23\u201326 |title=The Motor Car Past, Present and Future |first=Giancarlo |last=Genta |first2=Lorenzo |last2=Morello |first3=Francesco |last3=Cavallino |first4=Luigi |last4=Filtri |publisher=Springer |year=2014 |isbn=9789400785519 |accessdate=28 March 2016}}</ref> The Lambda though its open layout, with unstressed roof, made it less a ''monocoque'' shell and more a bowl - 11,000 were produced.<ref name=\"R&T\">{{cite web|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/car-technology/news/a17656/from-the-carriage-trade-to-carbon-fiber/ |title=From the Carriage Trade to Carbon Fiber All about an automobile's body/chassis |publisher=Road and Track |first=Dennis |last=Simanaitis |date=5 October 2011 |accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nA key role in developing the unitary body was played by the American firm the [[Budd Company#Automobiles|Budd Company (now ThyssenKrupp Budd)]].<ref name=\"R&T\"/> Budd supplied pressed-steel bodywork, fitted to separate frames, to automakers [[Dodge]], [[Ford]], [[Buick]], and the French company, [[Citro\u00ebn]].  \nIn 1930, [[Joseph Ledwinka]], an engineer with Budd, designed an automobile prototype with full unitary construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hagley.org/librarynews/automobile-engineer-joseph-ledwinka |publisher=Hagley Museum and Library  |title=Joseph Ledwinka |author= |date=29 May 2013 |accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Citroen Traction Avant body-chassis unit (Autocar Handbook, 13th ed, 1935).jpg|thumb|right| [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant]] body-chassis unit (1934)]]\n[[Citro\u00ebn]] purchased this fully unitary body design for the [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant]].

This design provides weight savings, improved space utilisation, and ease of manufacture. Acceptance grew dramatically in the wake of the two [[energy crises]] of the 1970s and the [[2000s energy crisis|2000s]] where compact SUVs using a truck platform (primarily the USA market) were subjected to CAFE standards after 2005 (by the late-2000s truck-based compact SUVs were phased out and replaced with crossovers). An additional advantage of a strong-bodied car lies in the improved crash protection for its passengers.\n\n[[File:Lotus Elan car chassis.jpg|thumb|right|Backbone chassis of the 1962 [[Lotus Elan#1960s model|Lotus Elan]]]]\n\n===Backbone tube===\n{{main article|Backbone chassis}}\nA backbone chassis is a type of automobile construction chassis that is similar to the body-on-frame  design. Instead of a two-dimensional ladder type structure, it consists of a strong tubular backbone (usually rectangular in cross section) that connects the front and rear suspension attachment areas. A body is then placed on this structure.\n\n===X-frame===\n[[File:Chassis (4689544886).jpg|thumb|Rolling X-frame chassis]]\nThis is the design used for the full-size American models of General Motors in the late 1950s and early 1960s in which the rails from alongside the engine seemed to cross in the passenger compartment, each continuing to the opposite end of the crossmember at the extreme rear of the vehicle. It was specifically chosen to decrease the overall height of the vehicles regardless of the increase in the size of the transmission and propeller shaft humps, since each row had to cover frame rails as well. Several models had the differential located not by the customary bar between axle and frame, but by a ball joint atop the differential connected to a socket in a wishbone hinged onto a crossmember of the frame.\n\nThe X-frame was claimed to improve on previous designs, but it lacked side rails and thus did not provide adequate side-impact and collision protection.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.curbsideclassic.com/automotive-histories/automotive-history-an-x-ray-look-at-gms-x-frame-1957-1970/ |title=Automotive History: An X-Ray Look At GM's X Frame (1957 \u2013 1970) |first=Paul |last=Niedermeyer |date=19 January 2012 |website=Curb Side Classic |accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref>\nThis design was replaced by perimeter frames.\n\n===Perimeter frame===\n[[File:Anadol FW11 prototype chassis.jpg|thumb|[[Reliant FW11|Anadol FW11]] prototype with perimeter frame]]\nSimilar to a ladder frame, but the middle sections of the frame rails sit outboard of the front and rear rails just behind the rocker / sill panels. This was done to allow for a lower floor pan, especially at the passenger footwells, to lower the passengers' seating height and therefore reduce the overall vehicle height in passenger cars. This became the prevalent design for [[body-on-frame]] cars in the United States, but not in the rest of the world, until the uni-body gained popularity. It allowed for annual model changes introduced in the 1950s to increase sales, but without costly structural changes. As of 2014, there are no perimeter frame automobiles sold in the United States after the Ford Motor Company phased out the Panther platform in 2011, which ended the perimeter frame passenger car in the United States (the Chevrolet Corvette has used a variation of the perimeter frame since 1963, but its seventh generation variant has elements of the perimeter frame integrated with an internal endoskeleton which serves as a clamshell).\n\nIn addition to a lowered roof, the perimeter frame allows lower seating positions when that is desirable, and offers better safety in the event of a side impact. However, the design lacks stiffness, because the transition areas from front to center and center to rear reduce beam and torsional resistance, hence the use of torque boxes, and soft suspension settings.\n\n===Platform frame===\n{{Multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = VW kaefer 1300 1966 unterboden.jpg\n| width1 = {{#expr: (875 / 1167 * 220 * 1156 / 908) round 0}}\n| caption1 = VW Beetle \"platform frame\" chassis.\n| image2 = Ch\u00e2ssis restaur\u00e9.jpg\n| width2 = 220\n| caption2 = Renault 4 \"platform frame\" chassis.\n| footer = Where the Volkswagen frame design relies heavily on a strong backbone, the Renault design is much closer to that of a typical perimeter frame.\n}}\nThis is a modification of the perimeter frame or of the backbone frame, in which the passenger compartment floor, and sometimes also the luggage compartment floor have been integrated into the frame as loadbearing parts, for extra strength and rigidity. Neither floor pieces are simply sheet metal straight off the roll, but have been stamped with ridges and hollows for extra strength.\n\nPlatform chassis were used on several successful European cars. The most well-known of this is the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], on which it is called body on pan construction. Another German example are the [[Mercedes-Benz Ponton|Mercedes-Benz \"Ponton\"]] cars of the 1950s and 1960s,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://forums.vwvortex.com/showthread.php?4743728-Mercedes-Benz-190SL-the-Teutonic-T-bird-is-born-1954 |title=Thread: Mercedes Benz 190SL, the \"Teutonic T-bird\" is born, 1954... |publisher=vwvortex.com |accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref> where it was called a \"frame floor\" in English-language advertisements.\n\nThe French [[Renault 4]] of which over eight million were made, also used a platform frame. The frame of the [[Citroen 2CV]] represents a more minimal interpretation of a platform chassis.\n\n===Space frame===\n{{main article|Space frame#Cars}}\nIn a (tubular) spaceframe chassis, the suspension, engine, and body panels are attached to a three-dimensional skeletal frame of tubes, and the body panels have little or no structural function. In order to maximise rigidity and minimise weight, the design makes maximum use of triangles, and all the forces in each strut are either tensile or compressive, never bending, so they can be kept as thin as possible.\n[[File:Jaguar C-Type Frame.JPG|thumb|right|Jaguar C-Type frame]]\nThe first true spaceframe chassis were produced in the  1930s by [[Buckminster Fuller]] and [[William Bushnell Stout]] (the [[Dymaxion car|Dymaxion]] and the [[Stout Scarab]]) who understood the theory of the true spaceframe from either architecture or aircraft design.<ref name=\"Ludvigsen, Colin Chapman, 150\" >{{Cite book |title=Colin Chapman: Inside the Innovator |last=Ludvigsen |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Ludvigsen |publisher=Haynes Publishing |year=2010 |isbn=1-84425-413-5 |ref={{harvid|Ludvigsen|Colin Chapman}} |pages=150\u2013164}}</ref>\n\nThe 1951 [[Jaguar C-Type]] [[sports car racing|racing sports car]] that won the [[Le Mans 24 hours]] twice, had a lightweight multi-tubular, triangulated frame, over which an aerodynamic aluminium body was crafted.\n\nThe Italian term ''[[Superleggera]]'' (meaning \"super-light\") was trademarked by [[Carrozzeria Touring]] for lightweight sports-car body construction that ''only resembles'' a space-frame chassis. Using a three-dimensional frame that consists of a cage of narrow tubes that, besides being under the body, run up the fenders and over the radiator, cowl, and roof, and under the rear window, it resembles a geodesic structure. A skin is attached to the outside of the frame and is often made of aluminium. This body construction is however ''not'' stress-bearing, and still requires the addition of a chassis.\n[[File:Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4 chassis - Flickr - J.Smith831.jpg|thumb|The Lamborghini Aventador has a carbon fibre central monocoque, with front and rear steel subframes, mounting the mechanicals]]\n\n===Subframe===\n{{main article|Subframe}}\nA subframe is a distinct structural frame component, to reinforce or complement a particular section of a vehicle's structure. Typically attached to a unibody or a monocoque, the rigid subframe can handle high chassis forces and can transfer them evenly over a wide area of relatively thin sheet metal of a unitized body shell. Subframes are often found at the front or rear end of cars, and are used to attach the [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] to the vehicle.  A subframe may also contain the [[Engine#Modern|engine]] and [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]].
