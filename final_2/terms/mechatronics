Mechatronics' aim is a design process that unifies these subfields. Originally, mechatronics just included the combination of mechanics and electronics, hence the word is a combination of '''mecha'''nics and elec'''tronics'''; however, as technical systems have become more and more complex the definition has been broadened to include more technical areas.\n\nThe word \"mechatronics\" originated in [[Wasei-eigo|Japanese-English]] and was created by Tetsuro Mori, an engineer of [[Yaskawa Electric Corporation]]. The word \"mechatronics\" was registered as [[trademark]] by the company in Japan with the registration number of \"46-32714\" in 1971. However, afterward the company released the right of using the word to public, and the word \"mechatronics\" spread to the rest of the world. Nowadays, the word is translated in each language and the word is considered as an essential term for industry.\n\nFrench standard NF E 01-010 gives the following definition: \u201capproach aiming at the synergistic integration of mechanics, electronics, control theory, and computer science within product design and manufacturing, in order to improve and/or optimize its functionality\".\n\nMany people treat \"mechatronics\" as a modern buzzword synonymous with \"[[electromechanical engineering]]\".<ref>\n[http://www.lcti.org/Page/1110 \"Electromechanical/Mechatronics Technology\"]. lcti.org</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Lawrence J.

An [[industrial robot]] is a prime example of a mechatronics system; it includes aspects of electronics, mechanics, and computing to do its day-to-day jobs.\n\n[[Engineering cybernetics]] deals with the question of control [[engineering]] of mechatronic systems. It is used to control or regulate such a system (see [[control theory]]). Through collaboration, the mechatronic modules perform the production goals and inherit flexible and agile manufacturing properties in the production scheme. Modern production equipment consists of mechatronic modules that are integrated according to a control architecture. The most known architectures involve [[hierarchy]], [[polyarchy]], [[heterarchy]], and hybrid. The methods for achieving a technical effect are described by control [[algorithm]]s, which might or might not utilize [[formal method]]s in their design. Hybrid systems important to mechatronics include [[Operations management#Production systems|production systems]], synergy drives,\n[[Mars Exploration Rover|planetary exploration rovers]], automotive subsystems such as [[anti-lock braking system]]s and spin-assist, and everyday equipment such as autofocus cameras, video, [[hard disk]]s, and CD players.\n\n==Course structure==\nMechatronics students take courses in various fields:\n\n*[[Mechanical engineering]] and [[materials science]]\n*[[Electrical engineering]]\n*[[Computer engineering]] (software & hardware engineering)\n*[[Computer science]]\n*Systems and control engineering\n*[[Optical engineering]]\n\n==Application==\n* [[Machine vision]]\n* [[Automation]] and [[robotics]]\n* [[servomechanism|Servo-mechanics]]\n* [[sensor|Sensing]] and [[control system]]s\n* [[Automotive engineering]], automotive equipment in the design of subsystems such as [[anti-lock braking system]]s\n* Computer-machine controls, such as computer driven machines like IE CNC milling machines\n* Expert systems\n* Industrial goods\n* Consumer products\n* Mechatronics systems\n* Medical mechatronics, medical imaging systems\n* Structural dynamic systems\n* Transportation and vehicular systems\n* Mechatronics as the new language of the automobile\n* Computer aided and integrated manufacturing systems\n* [[Computer aided design|Computer-aided design]]\n* Engineering and manufacturing systems\n* Packaging\n* Microcontrollers / PLCs\n* [[Mobile apps]]\n* M&E Engineering\n\n==Physical implementations==\nMechanical modeling calls for modeling and simulating physical complex phenomenon in the scope of a multi-scale and multi-physical approach. This implies to implement and to manage modeling and optimization methods and tools, which are integrated in a systemic approach.\nThe specialty is aimed at students in mechanics who want to open their mind to systems engineering, and able to integrate different physics or technologies, as well as students in mechatronics who want to increase their knowledge in optimization and multidisciplinary simulation technics.\nThe specialty educates students in robust and/or optimized conception methods for structures or many technological systems, and to the main modeling and simulation tools used in R&D. Special courses are also proposed for original applications (multi-materials composites, innovating transducers and [[actuator]]s, integrated systems, \u2026) to prepare the students to the coming breakthrough in the domains covering the materials and the systems.\nFor some mechatronic systems, the main issue is no longer how to implement a control system, but how to implement actuators. Within the mechatronic field, mainly two technologies are used to produce movement/motion.\nand\n\n==Variant of the field==\nAn emerging variant of this field is [[biomechatronics]], whose purpose is to integrate mechanical parts with a human being, usually in the form of removable gadgets such as an [[exoskeleton]]. This is the \"real-life\" version of [[cyberware]].\n\nAnother variant that we can consider is Motion control for Advanced Mechatronics, which presently is recognized as a key technology in mechatronics. The robustness of motion control will be represented as a function of stiffness and a basis for practical realization. Target of motion is parameterized by control stiffness which could be variable according to the task reference. However, the system robustness of motion always requires very high stiffness in the controller.<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=491410 \u2033Motion Control and Advanced Mechatronics\u2033].</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Robotics|Electronics}} \n* [[Cybernetics]]\n* [[Control theory]]\n* [[Ecomechatronics]]\n* [[Electromechanics]]\n* [[List of engineering journals and magazines#Mechatronics|Mechatronics journals]]\n* [[List of engineering topics]] \n* [[Materials engineering]] \n* [[Mechanical engineering technology]]\n* [[Robotics]] \n* [[Stereochemistry]]\n* [[Supramolecular]] engineering\n* [[Systems engineering]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Bradley, Dawson et al., ''Mechatronics, Electronics in products and processes'', Chapman and Hall Verlag, [[London]], 1991.\n* Karnopp, Dean C., Donald L.
