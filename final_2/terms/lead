It is a soft, [[malleable]], and [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy]] metal. Freshly cut solid lead has a bluish-white color that soon [[tarnish]]es to a dull grayish color when exposed to air; the liquid metal has shiny chrome-silver luster. Lead's density of 11.34&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup> exceeds that of most common materials. Lead has the second highest [[atomic number]] of all practically stable elements. As such, lead is located at the end of some [[decay chain]]s of heavier elements, which in part accounts for the relative abundance of lead: it exceeds those of other similarly-numbered elements.\n\nLead is a [[post-transition metal]], and is relatively inert unless powdered. Its weakened metallic character is illustrated by its general [[amphoteric]] nature: it and its oxides react with both acids and bases. It also displays a marked tendency toward covalent bonding. Its compounds are most commonly found in the +2 oxidation state, rather than +4, unlike the lighter [[group 14 elements]]. Exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds, where the positive charge on lead is dispersed and stabilized. Like the lighter group 14 elements, lead shows a tendency to bond to itself, forming complicated chain, ring, or polyhedral structures.\n\nLead is relatively easy to extract, and the metal was known to prehistoric people in Western Asia. While its softness and dullness prevented it from high demand, [[galena]]\u2014a principle ore of lead\u2014often bore silver in it, which helped initiate production of lead. Lead production peaked in [[ancient Rome]], and lead became easily available to common people. After the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]], levels of lead production fell, and those of Rome were not surpassed anywhere until as late as the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The metal was established as poisonous as late as in the late nineteenth century, which led to its eventual displacement from many uses, and it has been or is being phased out from those which include immediate contact to people.\n\nLead has several properties that make it advantageous to use, alongside its commonness: high density, low melting point, ductility, and relative inertness against oxygen attack. Lead minerals are easier to mine and lead is easier to extract from its ores than many other metals, which makes the resulting metal relatively inexpensive. For example, lead is used in building construction, [[lead\u2013acid batteries]], [[bullet]]s and [[lead shot|shot]], weights, as part of [[solder]]s, [[pewter]]s, [[fusible alloy]]s, and as a [[radiation shield]]. Currently, lead is produced in quantities of around ten thousand tonnes annually; secondary production from recycling is gaining ground, accounting for around half of that figure. Lead's toxicity has been a reason why lead was or is being phased out for some uses. If ingested or inhaled, lead and its compounds are [[poisonous]] to animals and humans. Lead is a [[neurotoxin]] which accumulates in soft tissues and bones, damaging the [[nervous system]] and causing [[brain]] disorders. Excessive lead also causes blood disorders in [[mammals]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe modern English word \"lead\" is of Germanic origin; it comes from the [[Middle English]] ''leed'' and [[Old English]] ''l\u0113ad'' (with the [[macron]] above the \"e\" signifying that the vowel sound of that letter is long).<ref>{{Cite web|author=[[Merriam-Webster]]|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lead|title=Definition of LEAD|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=12 August 2016}}</ref> The Old English word is derived from the hypothetical [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*lauda-'' (\"lead\").{{sfn|Kroonen|2013|loc=*lauda-}} According to the linguistic hypothesis, this word bore descendants in most Germanic languages (with a major exception being German) of exactly the same meaning.\n\nThe origin of the Proto-Germanic ''*lauda-'' is not agreed on in the linguistic community. One hypothesis suggests it is derived from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*lAudh-'' (\"lead\"; capitalization of the vowel is equivalent to the macron).<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=config&morpho=0&basename=%255Cdata%255Cie%255Cpiet&first=1&off=&text_proto=laudh&method_proto=substring&ic_proto=on&text_meaning=&method_meaning=substring&ic_meaning=on&text_hitt=&method_hitt=substring&ic_hitt=on&text_tokh=&method_tokh=substring&ic_tokh=on&text_ind=&method_ind=substring&ic_ind=on&text_avest=&method_avest=substring&ic_avest=on&text_iran=&method_iran=substring&ic_iran=on&text_arm=&method_arm=substring&ic_arm=on&text_greek=&method_greek=substring&ic_greek=on&text_slav=&method_slav=substring&ic_slav=on&text_balt=&method_balt=substring&ic_balt=on&text_germ=&method_germ=substring&ic_germ=on&text_lat=&method_lat=substring&ic_lat=on&text_ital=&method_ital=substring&ic_ital=on&text_celt=&method_celt=substring&ic_celt=on&text_alb=&method_alb=substring&ic_alb=on&text_rusmean=&method_rusmean=substring&ic_rusmean=on&text_refer=&method_refer=substring&ic_refer=on&text_comment=&method_comment=substring&ic_comment=on&text_any=&method_any=substring&sort=proto&ic_any=on|title=Indo-European etymology|entry=*lAudh-|editor-first=Sergei|year=2012|editor-last=Nikolayev|website=starling.rinet.ru|access-date=21 August 2016}}</ref><!--this is a worthy ref, based on a very respected dictionary; the database itself has been mentioned in Proto-IE-related works--> Another hypothesis suggests it is borrowed from [[Proto-Celtic language|Proto-Celtic]] ''*\u0278loud-io-'' (\"lead\"). This word is related to the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''plumbum'', which gave the element its [[chemical symbol]] ''Pb''. The origin of ''*\u0278loud-io-'' presumably pre-dates the Proto-Indo-European language;{{sfn|Kroonen|2013|loc=*lauda-}} while it is yet unknown, it is suggested it is also the origin of Proto-Germanic ''*bliwa-'' (which also means \"lead\"), from which stemmed the German ''Blei'' (\"lead\").{{sfn|Kroonen|2013|loc=*bliwa- 2}}\n\nThe name of the chemical element is not related to the verb of the same spelling, which is instead derived from (eventually) Proto-Germanic ''*laidijan-'' (\"to lead\").{{sfn|Kroonen|2013|loc=*laidijan-}}\n\n== Properties ==\n\n=== Atomic ===\n\nA lead atom has 82 electrons, arranged in an electronic configuration of &#91;[[xenon|Xe]]&#93;4f<sup>14</sup>5d<sup>10</sup>6s<sup>2</sup>6p<sup>2</sup>. The combined first and second [[ionization energy]] of lead\u2014the total energy required to remove the two 6p electrons from a neutral lead atom\u2014is close to that of tin, its upper neighbor in [[group 14 element|group 14]]. This is unusual since ionization energies generally fall going down a group as an element's electrons become more distant from its nucleus. The similarity is attributable to the [[lanthanide contraction]]. This describes the greater-than-expected decrease in the radii of elements in the lanthanide series from atomic number 57, lanthanum, to 71, lutetium, and causes smaller than otherwise expected ionic radii for the subsequent elements starting with 72, hafnium. It results from poor shielding of the nucleus by the lanthanide 4f electrons; the outer electrons are drawn towards the nucleus, thus resulting in a smaller atomic radius. The combined first four ionization energies of lead exceed those of tin{{sfn|Lide|2004|p=10-179}} contrary to what the [[periodic trends]] would predict. For this reason lead, unlike tin,{{sfn|Polyanskiy|1986|pp=14\u201315}} rarely has a +4 oxidation state in inorganic compounds.{{sfn|Polyanskiy|1986|pp=14\u201315}} Such behavior is attributable to [[relativistic effects]], which become particularly prominent at the bottom of the periodic table;{{sfn|Polyanskiy|1986|pp=14\u201315}} the result is that the 6s electrons of lead become reluctant to participate in bonding,{{efn|About 10% of the [[lanthanide contraction]] has also been attributed to [[relativistic effect]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | first = P. | last = Pyykko | authorlink = Pekka Pyykko | title = Relativistic effects in structural chemistry | journal = [[Chemical Reviews]] | year = 1988 | volume = 88 | pages = 563\u2013594 | doi = 10.1021/cr00085a006 | issue = 3}}</ref>}} a phenomenon referred to as the [[inert pair effect]].\n\nAll the lighter elements in group 14 have a stable or metastable allotrope in which they crystallize in the [[diamond cubic]] structure, involving [[covalent bond]]s. In this structure, each atom is tetrahedrally coordinated, indicating that all four bonds are equivalent, having each attained the lowest possible energy. To explain this, in spite of the fact that two of the electrons are in s-orbitals and the other two in higher-energy p-orbitals, [[orbital hybridization]] is invoked, in which one of the electrons is \"promoted\" from an s-orbital to a p-orbital, and then all form four intermediate hybrid orbitals in a process called sp<sup>3</sup> hybridization. The inert pair effect affects the crystal structure of lead, because the promotion energy of a 6s-electron becomes larger than the amount of energy that would be released from the additional bonds formed.{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|p=227}} Thus, rather than having the diamond-cubic covalent structure, lead forms [[metallic bonding|metallic bonds]], in which only the p-electrons are delocalized and shared between the Pb<sup>2+</sup> ions, resulting in a [[face-centered cubic]] structure like those of the similarly-sized divalent [[calcium]] and [[strontium]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9tO_9Tf6dZgC|title=Relativistic Electronic Structure Theory - Fundamentals|editor-last=Schwerdtfeger|editor-first=P.|chapter=Relativistic Solid State Theory|first=N.

The tetravalent state is common for group 14. Tne divalent state is rare for carbon and silicon, minor for germanium, important (but not prevailing) for tin, and is the more important for lead: even the strongest oxidizing agents, oxygen and fluorine, initially oxidize lead only to lead(II).{{sfn|Greenwood|Earnshaw|1998|p=373}} This is caused by relativistic effects, specifically the inert pair effect, which manifests itself when there is a large difference in electronegativity between lead and, for example, [[oxide]], [[halide]], or [[nitride]] anions, leading to a significant partial positive charge on lead. The result is a stronger contraction of the lead 6s orbital than is the case for the 6p orbital, making it rather inert in ionic compounds. This is not quite as applicable to compounds in which lead forms [[covalent bond]]s to elements of similar electronegativity such as carbon in [[organolead compound]]s. Here the 6s and 6p orbitals remain similarly sized and sp<sup>3</sup> hybridization in compounds is still energetically favorable; as such, lead, like carbon, is predominantly tetravalent in organolead compounds.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Chemical Bond : Chemical Bonding Across the Periodic Table|chapter=Chemical Bonding of Main-Group Elements|first=M. |last=Kaupp|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|year=2014|doi=10.1002/9783527664658.ch1|editor-last=Frenking|editor-first=G.|editor-last2=Shaik|editor-first2=S.|url=https://application.wiley-vch.de/books/sample/3527333150_c01.pdf|pp=9\u201310}}</ref> The 5s electron pair tends to be stereochemically active in tin(II) compounds, but is much less so in lead(II) compounds.

The letter \"s\" stands for \"slow\" or \"[[slow neutron]] capture\", and the letter \"r\" stands for \"rapid neutron capture\": in the s-process another [[neutron capture|capture]] takes a long time, centuries or millennia, while the r-process takes only tens of seconds to result in a heavy nuclide of lead's mass. In the s-process, a nucleus in a star captures another slow neutron, and if the resulting nucleus is unstable, it typically undergoes a [[beta decay]] to become an element of the next atomic number. Lead-204 is created from short-lived thallium-204; on capturing another neutron, it becomes lead-205, which, while unstable, is stable enough to generally last longer than a capture takes (its half-life is around 15 million years). Further captures result in lead-206, lead-207, and lead-208. On capturing another neutron, lead-208 becomes lead-209, which quickly decays into bismuth-209, which on capturing another neutron becomes bismuth-210, which either undergoes an alpha decay to result in thallium-206, which would beta decay into lead-206, or a beta decay to yield polonium-210, which would inevitably alpha decay into lead-206 as well, and the cycle ends at lead-206, lead-207, lead-208, and bismuth-209. As a result, relative abundances of the stable lead and bismuth isotopes are multiplied by a \"cycling factor\", which depends on the conditions of the process.<ref name=\"B2FH\">{{cite journal |first1=E.

Lead and bismuth are thus very common in stars, in which nucleosynthesis mostly happens through the s-process.<ref name=nucleosynthesis/>\n\nApart from the s-process, the latter three isotopes have been synthesized as a result of the r-process (lead-204 is not produced in this manner because its [[isobar (nuclide)|isobar]] mercury-204 is stable, and it is not formed as a decay product of r-process products). The r-process happens in mediums of great electron density. In such conditions, beta decay is blocked, because the high electron density fills all available free electron states up to a [[Fermi energy]] which is greater than the energy of nuclear beta decay. But nuclear capture of those free neutrons can still occur, and it causes neutron enrichment of matter. This results an extremely high density of free neutrons which cannot decay, and, correspondingly, a large neutron flux and high temperatures, which is the reason why neutron capture occurs much faster than beta decay.<ref name=B2FH/> The r-process does not directly form as much lead as the s-process, because neutron-rich nuclei with mass numbers 206\u2013208 that would decay to lead are not [[magic number (physics)|magic]], unlike those that reach the closed neutron shell at neutron number 126 and decay to the [[platinum group metal]]s around mass number 194.<ref name=nucleosynthesis/> This effect is nevertheless masked, because these lead isotopes are also located at the end of three major decay chains (see [[#Isotopes|above]]), they are created by the decay of the heavier elements, which are also created by the r-process.<ref name=\"B2FH\"/> Most synthesized nuclides with mass numbers just above those of stable lead and bismuth, quickly undergo alpha and beta decay to stable lead and bismuth isotopes. Nuclides with mass numbers 232, 235, and 238 and above soon decay to the extremely long-lived isotopes of [[thorium]] and [[uranium]], which decay very slowly to lead. These decay away quite slowly and, in some quantities, still exist to this day; therefore, the amount of lead in the universe is still increasing, although noticeably only in perspective of millions of years.<ref name=nucleosynthesis>{{cite journal |last=Roederer |first=I.

As such, smelting is only performed when metallic lead had undergone significant chemical transformation, such as oxidation/rusting.{{sfn|Thornton|Radu|Brush|2001|p=56}} When smelting is performed, it is performed in a fashion similar to that of the primary production in either a blast furnace or a [[rotary furnace]] (though both, with the essential difference being the greater variability of what could be extracted as the final product after the latter). The [[Isasmemt process]] is a more recent method that possesses a possibility of extension to the primary production; the essence of this process is that the input battery paste is deprived of its sulfur content (by, for example, treating it with alkalies) and then treated in a coal-fueled furnace in presence of oxygen, which eventually yields impure lead with antimony being the most common impurity.{{sfn|Thornton|Radu|Brush|2001|p=57}}\n\nRefining of secondary lead is similar to that of primary lead; some refining processes may be skipped depending on the material recycled and its potential contamination, with bismuth and silver being skipped especially often of all major impurities.{{sfn|Thornton|Radu|Brush|2001|p=57}}\n\nOf the sources of lead for recycling, lead\u2013acid batteries is the most important one; lead pipe, sheet, and cable sheathing are also significant sources.{{sfn|Thornton|Radu|Brush|2001|p=56}}\n\n== Applications ==\n\nContrary to popular belief, pencil leads in wooden pencils have never been made from lead.

While many metals are superior to lead in some of these aspects, lead is also more common than most of these metals; moreover, lead minerals are easier to mine <!--(see [[#either On Earth or Production?]])--> and then lead is easier to extract from its ores than many other metals, which makes the resulting metal relatively inexpensive.

As lead paint deteriorates, it peels, is pulverized into dust and then enters the body through hand-to-mouth contact or through contaminated food, water, or alcohol. Ingesting certain home remedy medicines may also expose people to lead or lead compounds.<ref name=\"health\" /> Lead can be ingested through fruits and vegetables contaminated by high levels of lead in the soils they were grown in. Soil is contaminated through particulate accumulation from lead in pipes, lead paint and residual emissions from leaded gasoline that was used before the Environment Protection Agency issued the regulation in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/lead/community/index.html|title=Information for the Community Lead Toxicity|work=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry}}</ref> The use of lead for water pipes is problematic in areas with soft or (and) acidic water. Hard water forms insoluble layers in the pipes while soft and acidic water dissolves the lead pipes.<ref>{{cite journal|date=1977|title=Lead in drinking water in soft water areas\u2014health hazards|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=7|issue=2|pages=109\u2013115|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(77)90002-X|pmid=841299|last1=Moore|first1=M. R.}}</ref>\n\nInhalation is the second major pathway of exposure, especially for workers in lead-related occupations. Almost all inhaled lead is absorbed into the body, the rate is 20\u201370% for ingested lead; children absorb more than adults.<ref name=\"health\" />\n\nDermal exposure may be significant for a narrow category of people working with organic lead compounds, but is of little concern for general population, as most countries stopped using leaded gasoline by 2007. The rate of skin absorption is also low for inorganic lead.<ref name=\"health\" />\n\n=== Environmental ===\n\nThe extraction, production, use, and disposal of lead and its products have caused significant contamination of the Earth's soils and waters, posing a hazard to living organisms because of its toxicity. Atmospheric emissions of lead were at their peak during the Industrial Revolution and the period of leaded petrol in the second half of the twentieth century; although these periods are over, elevated concentrations of lead persist in soils and sediments in post-industrial and urban areas. Meanwhile, industrial emissions continue in many parts of the world.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[United Nations Environment Programme]], Chemicals Branch, Division of Technology, Industry and Economics |url=http://www.unep.org/chemicalsandwaste/Portals/9/Lead_Cadmium/docs/Interim_reviews/UNEP_GC26_INF_11_Add_1_Final_UNEP_Lead_review_and_apppendix_Dec_2010.pdf |pp=11\u201333 |title=Final review of scientific information on lead  |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |year=2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1plombs chasse cygne cond\u00e92.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Radiography of a swan found dead in [[Cond\u00e9-sur-l'Escaut]] (northern France), highlighting lead shot.

According to the [[US EPA|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], lead from soils may take places of other metals within organic matter, particularly plants. In plants, lead accumulates on the surface, thus covering the plant from the incoming [[carbon dioxide]], reducing the rate of [[photosynthesis]], which trump the growth of the plant or kills it. Contamination of soils and plants, in turn, affects microorganisms and animals. Affected animals have reduced ability to synthesize [[red blood cell]]s. Sources of contamination of the environment with lead are thus being limited.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lead.org.au/lanv1n2/lanv1n2-8.html|title=Effects of lead on the environment|last=Ratcliffe|first=D.
