They have released nine studio albums, three compilations, two EPs, and 34 singles. They have spent a total of 181 weeks on the singles and albums charts combined with their own releases as of 2016, and have accumulated 25 top 75 singles between 1997 and 2012. The band have also had two chart appearances as featured or guest performers, with their appearance on the [[Band Aid 20]] single in 2004 being their only number one single if regarded.\n\nFeeder's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including [[The Police]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], and [[The Smashing Pumpkins]]. Their early material showcased a heavy rock sound reminiscent of [[grunge]], but the band would later introduce more [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] aspects into their music, including elements of pianos and string orchestras.\n\nThe band was formed in 1992<ref name=\"tjs\"/> under the name of \"Reel\" by vocalist and guitarist [[Grant Nicholas]], drummer [[Jon Lee (drummer)|Jon Lee]] and bassist Simon Blight, three of the four members of [[Raindancer]], after the departure of that band's other member, guitarist John Canham. However, Blight left Reel later in 1992, and the band played with many session bassists before hiring [[Taka Hirose]] in 1995,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nickbrownonline.co.uk/faq/faqjonlee.htm |title=Memories of Jon Lee|work=Nick Brown Online|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> a year after the band signed with [[The Echo Label]].\n\nFeeder garnered media attention in 2001 for their third album, ''[[Echo Park (album)|Echo Park]]'', and its lead single, \"[[Buck Rogers (song)|Buck Rogers]]\", which later become a UK Top 5 single. In January 2002, Jon Lee committed suicide in his Miami home, after which the remaining members began to record and play with former [[Skunk Anansie]] drummer [[Mark Richardson (musician)|Mark Richardson]]. They released their fourth album, ''[[Comfort in Sound]]'' later that year, which touched on themes such as loss and coming to terms with death, while also exploring themes of positivity. Richardson was ultimately made an official member, remaining so until May 2009 when he returned to a reformed Skunk Anansie. Feeder employed Australian Damon Wilson and former Mexicolas drummer Tim Trotter for sessions and touring commitments for ''[[Renegades (Feeder album)|Renegades]]'' (2010), and they have since employed drummer [[Karl Brazil]]. Between 2010-2016, the band charted three more top 20 albums, with the latest of these being 2016's ''[[All Bright Electric]]'' returning them to the top 10.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Formation and early releases (1991\u201396) ===\nAt the age of 14, singer and guitarist [[Grant Nicholas]] joined a band called 'Sweet Leaf', named after a song by [[Black Sabbath]], who were the first band he had seen play live.<ref name=\"FEEDER1997FAQ\">{{cite web|url=http://freespace.virgin.net/ali.bunny/feeder/faq.htm |title=Descend FAQ|work=Descend|accessdate=15 March 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014071012/http://freespace.virgin.net/ali.bunny/feeder/faq.htm |archivedate = 14 October 2007}}</ref> At this time Japanese bassist [[Taka Hirose]] and drummer [[Jon Lee (drummer)|Jon Lee]] were playing in different covers bands, but did not know each other.<ref name=\"FEEDER1997FAQ\" /> While playing in different bands on the [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] gig circuit, Grant and Jon became friends.

In February 2012 after Feeder had completed a mini-tour, which ended in Inverness and started in Exeter, \"Borders\" charted at #52 giving the band their 25th top 75 single and their first official chart visit since 2008's \"We Are the People\".<ref name=\"Chartstats\"/>\n\nCritical response, much like the previous few Feeder albums, was mixed.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/apr/22/feeder-generation-freakshow-review Feeder:Generation Freakshow-Review] The Guardian 22 April 2012 Retrieved 29 April 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.metro.co.uk/music/reviews/896796-feeders-generation-freakshow-sticks-to-the-same-predictable-formula \"Feeders Generation Freakshow sticks to same predictable formula\"] Metro 23 April 2012 Retrieved 29 April 2012</ref> [[BBC Music]] praised the album,<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/rv3q \"Feeder Generation Freakshow Review\"] BBC Music 10 April 2012 Retrieved 29 April 2012</ref> while ''[[Drowned in Sound]]'', despite negative reviews in the past, credited Feeder for creating another strong addition to their back catalogue.<ref name=\"Generation Freakshow Review\">[http://drownedinsound.com/releases/16953/reviews/4144795 \"Generation Freakshow Review\"] Drowned in Sound 23 April Retrieved 29 April 2012</ref> The album which was released to coincide with a week-long tour, however improved upon the respectable commercial response of ''Renegades'' by charting at #13, which increased the band's UK album charts span to fifteen years,<ref name=\"Chartstats\"/> while selling 7,338 units in the same week.<ref name=\"MW2\"/> In Japan, ''Generation Freakshow'' improved upon the relatively disappointing chart position of ''Renegades'', when it entered at #57 and became their most successful studio album in almost four years.<ref name=\"Oricon\"/> The only track from the sessions of the ''Renegades'' album to end up on ''Generation Freakshow'', was that of \"Tiny Minds\".<ref name=\"Generation Freakshow Review\"/> The week following the album's release, \"Children of the Sun\" was released as the album's second single and saw the band revert to the vinyl and download formats. Because of this, the single failed to chart while not attracting the same radio attention as \"Borders\". The title track was due to be a single, but was later pulled despite promotional CDs already being pressed and sent to radio. \"Idaho\" became the third single from the album, released on 27 August 2012. Like \"Children of the Sun\", this also failed to chart.\n\nThe band continued their year with a main stage appearance at the Isle of Wright Festival, opening the event. This was then followed by a first appearance in four years at the Reading Festival, although in their lowest position since their 1996 debut, headlining the fourth stage. Their appearance at the T in the Park festival that year was later cancelled, due to a band illness. It was announced in July that \"Idaho\" will be the third single from ''Generation Freakshow'', and will be released on 27 August.<ref name=\"Idaho\">{{cite web|url=http://www.music-news.com/shownews.asp?H=Feeder-to-release-new-single-Idaho&nItemID=54187|title=Feeder to release new single 'Idaho'|work=music-news.com|accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref> The band played at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in August as part of a series of concerts to celebrate the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], which was preceded by an appearance at [[Lusty Glaze]] in Newquay, alongside performances in Wales and Ireland, with the video shoot for \"Idaho\" in between.\n\nLater on in 2012, Feeder took on one last tour for the year. The tour lasted for five dates starting at the [[O2 Academy Glasgow]], before ending at the [[Brixton Academy]] in November. At the Brixton show, Grant Nicholas announced that the band would be going away for a while, before deciding what to do next. Earlier on before the tour began, Nicholas was interviewed by website ''Mancunian Matters'' in which he told them that the band would take a break next year with no shows planned, although a follow-up album was mentioned alongside possible side-projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mancunianmatters.co.uk/content/07116588-still-going-after-all-time-british-rockers-feeder-stronger-after-15-years-eight-alb|title=Still going after all this time: British rockers Feeder stronger after 15 years, eight albums and countless tours|work=mancunianmatters.co.uk|accessdate=31 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nAlthough 2013 was their first full year on hiatus, they played one show that year at Reading University as a private event, while no other shows were played. Their back catalog which was initially issued on The Echo Label, was later re-issued by [[Sony Music Entertainment]], thus allowing the distribution of this material to continue.\n\nDuring 2013, Hirose's side-project band Muddy Apes released their second album in Japan, which also features Tidey. Later, on 3 March 2014, Nicholas announced a solo project via the launch of a Twitter handle and Facebook page, while an official website is to be launched.\n\nOn 31 May 2014, Grant's debut solo recording \"Soul Mates\", was played on BBC Radio 2, with the release of his album ''[[Yorktown Heights (Grant Nicholas album)|Yorktown Heights]]'' on 23 July 2014 in Japan and 11 August 2014 in the United Kingdom. Shortly after the download release of \"Soul Mates\", Grant later posted a handwritten note on Facebook announcing the release date of his solo album, while also revealing \"Feeder's heart still beats strong\" and  has been working on new material.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/feederweb/photos/a.165234079982.117238.6063369982/10152252346974983/?type=1&permPage=1|title=Handwritten note on Facebook|accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2015 Grant revealed that \"there will be a new Feeder record next year\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4148728-feeder-is-still-a-massive-part-of-my-life---dis-meets-grant-nicholas|title=DiS Meets Grant Nicholas|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Return and ''All Bright Electric'' (2016\u2013present)===\nIn January 2016, the band posted photos of themselves recording in Grant's home studio, 'The Treehouse'. It was then announced on 29 January 2016 that Feeder would headline the Big Top stage at the [[Isle of Wight Festival]] in June, with the band stating that it would be one of their only UK festival appearances that year. On the 25th of February 2016, the band posted on their Facebook page, a CDR bearing their name in marker pen.\n\nOn 23 March, they announced on their Facebook page that they would headline LoopalluFestival in Ullapool, Highlands, Scotland on Friday September 30 as well as a picture of Grant performing on guitar at the tree house as the band continued to record their ninth studio album.\n\nIn June 15, the band announced that the album would be titled ''[[All Bright Electric]]''. The lead single, \"Universe of Life\" was released on the same day. The album was released on October 7th, 2016. \n\nIn August 26, the band released the single \"Eskimo\", along with its music video.\n\n==Criticism==\nIn a 2008 interview with ''Kerrang!'' on a selection of the band's singles, Nicholas expressed his annoyance with comparisons between [[Coldplay]] and the album ''[[Pushing the Senses]]''; he said that those comparisons were only made because he played a piano on many of the tracks that were on the album.<ref>[http://feederscrapbook.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/kerrangwecanwritegreatpopsongs2.jpg \"Kerrang (1215): We Can Write Great Pop Songs!\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320090927/http://feederscrapbook.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/kerrangwecanwritegreatpopsongs2.jpg |date=20 March 2009 }}. feederscrapbook.co.uk. 21 June 2008. Retrieved 10 September 2008.</ref> In a 2011 interview with Cambridge-based webzine ''The Tab'', he elaborated on his position regarding these comparisons, saying, \"Feeder have a much broader music dynamic musically, and we are a much heavier band, both live and on record. I have a lot of respect for Coldplay and we have toured with them, but we are two totally different bands, both dynamically and musically. I just think it's lazy journalism.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cambridgetab.co.uk/culture/interview-feeder|title=Interview: Feeder|work=The Tab| accessdate=11 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Sales and legacy==\nOver the course of their career, Feeder has come to domestically accumulate a total of eight gold and platinum records, with a gold record in Ireland for ''The Singles'', bringing their British Isles (and worldwide) total to nine. In 2015, \"Buck Rogers\" received a Silver award for 200,000 UK sales, 14 years after release.\n\nDespite having completely dropped out of mainstream radio play since 2008, while being relegated almost solely to alternative rock stations in the United Kingdom, ''Silent Cry'' reached #8 on the albums chart in its first week of release in 2008 with 16,000 units sold. It has sold less than 50,000 units to date according to Chrysalis, the owners of the now defunct Echo Label. The subsequent ''Silent Cry'' tour was Feeder's longest playing up to 29 different dates, with many selling out. Nevertheless, ''Silent Cry'' remains their first album since 1997's ''Polythene'' not to achieve at least gold status. The 2010 follow-up ''Renegades'', was less successful only spending two weeks in the chart after entering at #16, while also being their first since the aforementioned ''Polythene'' not to chart within the Top 10.\n\nHowever, the charting of ''Renegades'', marked the third decade in which a Feeder album had been released and charted at least in the Top 20. This marked their 6th studio album to appear in the Top 20 and the band's 9th album to appear on the chart regardless of position over the course of their career. The album also debuted at #1 on the Official UK Rock Albums chart.<ref name=\"17 July 2010\"/> Still, ''Renegades'' has yet to accumulate sales that approach or eclipse any of their other studio albums before this. 2012 follow-up ''Generation Freakshow'', charted higher at #13 although on lower debut week sales, before 2016 saw the band return to the top 10 with ''All Bright Electric''. 2002's ''Comfort in Sound'' is the band's best selling release, shifting over 503,706 units in the United Kingdom alone with ''The Singles'' taking second spot with 497,700 units. At the end of 2006, when the campaign for ''The Singles'' was drawing to a close, Feeder ranked as one of the UK's most successful chart acts of the past 50 years, with a total of 166 weeks across both charts without reaching the number one spot.<ref>By collating together the chart information in the 19th and final edition of ''British Hit Singles & Albums'' (Roberts, David (2006). ''British Hit Singles and Albums'' 19th Edition. Guinness. ISBN 1-904994-10-5), along with all 2006's weekly singles and albums charts, Feeder move from below the 2005 Top 500 listing to rank at #457 in 2006.</ref>\n\nIn Japan, Feeder have also gained a cult following, in which their last five studio albums have all charted in the top 100 between 2002 and 2012. Their most successful of these is 2008's ''Silent Cry'' charting at #53, although their most successful and only top 40 entry to date is their 2006 singles compilation, meaning the band have charted six albums regardless of format. In addition, much of their music has been featured in the ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]'' racing video game series, which is developed by the Japanese video game development studio [[Polyphony Digital]].\n\nFeeder are also one of Wales' most popular rock bands, highlighted in October 2003, by the display of Taka's bass guitar from the \"Seven Days in the Sun\" video at the [[Hard Rock Cafe]] in [[Cardiff]] and Grant's attendance at the branch's opening the same year. The Cardiff branch later closed in late 2010, one day shy of its seventh anniversary of opening.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/multimedia/news/images/2010/10/12/hard-rock-cafe-cardiff-closes-its-doors-91466-27453821|title=Hard Rock Cafe Cardiff Closes its Doors|work=Wales Online|accessdate=1 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/content_objectid=13756955_method=full_siteid=50082_headline=-Guitar-has-star-spot-at-HardRock-Cafe-name_page.html|title=Guitar has star spot at HardRock Cafe|work=Wales Online|accessdate=1 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the band's record sales are not of major totals, Feeder have however accumulated 25 top 75 singles between 1997-2012, a run which started with 1997's \"Tangerine\" charting at #60, before ending in 2012 with \"Borders\" at #52. Their top 75 singles tally, ties with artists such as Coldplay. Feeder have also headlined many of the United Kingdom's major venues, such as Wembley Arena, Birmingham National Indoor Arena, Birmingham LG Arena, Bournemouth International Centre and the Cardiff International Arena. Alongside this, Feeder also headlined a major festival for the first (and currently only) time in their career, which was at the 2005 Download festival.\n\nIn an April 2012 interview with British rock monthly ''[[Total Guitar]]'', the band were praised by Rob Laing citing \"All the way from their very first release, the ''Two Colours EP'' in 1995, through tragedy and triumph, he's [Grant] gone the distance with Feeder while other British alternative rock bands of the 90s crashed or faded\".<ref name=\"total guitar\">{{Cite book | last = Laing | first = Rob | year = 2012 | title = Total Guitar - Come Back Around | publisher = [[Future plc]] | pages = 56\u201360 }}</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n{{Main article|Feeder discography}}\n*''[[Polythene (album)|Polythene]]'' (1997)\n*''[[Yesterday Went Too Soon]]'' (1999)\n*''[[Echo Park (album)|Echo Park]]'' (2001)\n*''[[Comfort in Sound]]'' (2002)\n*''[[Pushing the Senses]]'' (2005)\n*''[[Silent Cry]]'' (2008)\n*''[[Renegades (Feeder album)|Renegades]]'' (2010)\n*''[[Generation Freakshow]]'' (2012)\n*''[[All Bright Electric]]'' (2016)\n\n==Members==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Current\n*[[Grant Nicholas]] - Lead vocals, lead guitars, piano <small>(1992\u2013present)</small>\n*[[Taka Hirose]] - Bass guitars, backing vocals <small>(1995\u2013present)</small><ref>[http://southwestshows.co.uk/2012/05/feeder-to-play-sundowner-sessions-at-lusty-glaze-beach-in-newquay-news Feeder to play Sundowner Sessions at Lusty Glaze Beach in Newquay (news)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531224726/http://southwestshows.co.uk/2012/05/feeder-to-play-sundowner-sessions-at-lusty-glaze-beach-in-newquay-news |date=31 May 2012 }}</ref>\n\n;Current touring members\n*Dean Deavall - keyboards, backing vocals <small>(2008\u2013present)</small>\n*Tom Gleeson - guitar, backing vocals <small>(2016\u2013present)</small>\n*Geoff Hollroyde - drums <small>(2016\u2013present)</small>\n\n{{col-2}}\n;Former\n*[[Karl Brazil]] - drums, percussion <small>(2009\u20132016)</small>\n*[[Mark Richardson (musician)|Mark Richardson]] - drums <small>(2002\u20132009)</small>\n*[[Jon Lee (drummer)|Jon Lee]] - drums <small>(1992\u20132002; died 2002)</small>\n*Simon Blight - bass <small>(1992)</small>\n\n;Former touring members\n*[[Nathan Connolly]] - guitar <small>(2016)</small>\n*Tim Trotter - drums <small>(2009\u20132012)</small>\n*Damon Wilson - drums <small>(2011\u20132012)</small>\n*[[Dean Tidey]] - guitars <small>(1999\u20132000, 2002\u20132009)</small>\n*Matt Sime - keyboards <small>(2000-2001)</small>\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Awards ==\n'''Major ceremonial awards'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
