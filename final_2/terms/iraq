From the 29th century BC, Akkadian Semitic names began to appear on king lists and administrative documents of various city states.\n\nDuring the 3rd millennium BCE, a cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and the Akkadians, which included widespread [[bilingualism]]. The influences between [[Sumer]]ian and [[Akkadian]] are evident in all areas, including lexical borrowing on a massive scale\u2014and syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence. This mutual influence has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian of the 3rd millennium BCE as a [[Sprachbund]].<ref>Deutscher, Guy (2007).

ISBN 978-0-19-953222-3.</ref> From this period, the civilisation in Iraq came to be known as [[Sumero-Akkadian]].\n\n[[File:Bill of sale Louvre AO3765.jpg|thumb|180px|Bill of sale of a male slave and a building in [[Shuruppak]], Sumerian tablet, circa 2600 BCE.]]\nBetween the 29th and 24th centuries BC, a number of kingdoms and city states within Iraq began to have Akkadian speaking dynasties; including [[Assyria]], [[Ekallatum]], [[Isin]] and [[Larsa]].\n\nHowever, the Sumerians remained generally dominant until the rise of the [[Akkadian Empire]] (2335-2124 BC), based in the city of [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]] in central Iraq. [[Sargon of Akkad]], originally a [[Rabshakeh]] to a Sumerian king, founded the empire, he conquered all of the city states of southern and central Iraq, and subjugated the kings of Assyria, thus uniting the Sumerians and Akkadians in one state. He then set about expanding his empire, conquering [[Gutium]], [[Elam]], [[Cissia (area)|Cissia]] and [[Turukku]] in [[Ancient Iran]], the [[Hurrians]], [[Luwians]] and [[Hattians]] of [[Anatolia]], and the [[Amorites]] and [[Ebla]]ites of [[Ancient Syria]].\n\nAfter the collapse of the Akkadian Empire in the late 22nd century BC, the [[Gutians]] occupied the south for a few decades, while Assyria reasserted its independence in the north. This was followed by a Sumerian renaissance in the form of the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]]. The Sumerians under king [[Shulgi]] conquered almost all of Iraq except the northern reaches of Assyria, and asserted themselves over the [[Elamites]], [[Gutians]] and [[Amorites]].\n\nAn [[Elam]]ite invasion in 2004 BC brought the Sumerian revival to an end. By the mid 21st century BC, the Akkadian speaking kingdom of [[Assyria]] had risen to dominance in northern Iraq. Assyria expanded territorially into the north eastern Levant, central Iraq, and eastern Anatolia, forming the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] (circa 2035-1750 BC) under kings such as [[Puzur-Ashur I]], [[Sargon I]], [[Ilushuma]] and [[Erishum I]], the latter of whom produced the most detailed set of [[Written Laws]] yet written. The south broke up into a number of Akkadian speaking states, [[Isin]], [[Larsa]] and [[Eshnunna]] being the major ones.\n\nDuring the 20th century BC, the [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] speaking [[Northwest Semitic]] [[Amorites]] began to migrate into southern Mesopotamia. Eventually, these Amorites began to set up small petty kingdoms in the south, as well as usurping the thrones of extant city states such as [[Isin]], [[Larsa]] and [[Eshnunna]].\n\n[[File:P1050771 Louvre code Hammurabi bas relief rwk.JPG|thumb|180px|[[Hammurabi]], depicted as receiving his royal insignia from [[Shamash]]. Relief on the upper part of the stele of [[code of Hammurabi|Hammurabi's code of laws]].]]\nOne of these small kingdoms founded in 1894 BC contained the then small administrative town of [[Babylon]] within its borders. It remained insignificant for over a century, overshadowed by older and more powerful states, such as Assyria, Elam, Isin, Ehnunna and Larsa.\n\nIn 1792 BC, an [[Amorite]] ruler named [[Hammurabi]] came to power in this state, and immediately set about building Babylon from a minor town into a major city, declaring himself its king. Hammurabi conquered the whole of southern and central Iraq, as well as Elam to the east and Mari to the west, then engaged in a protracted war with the Assyrian king [[Ishme-Dagan]] for domination of the region, creating the short-lived [[Babylonian Empire]]. He eventually prevailed over the successor of Ishme-Dagan and subjected Assyria and its Anatolian colonies.\n\nIt is from the period of Hammurabi that southern Iraq came to be known as [[Babylonia]], while the north had already coalesced into [[Assyria]] hundreds of years before. However, his empire was short-lived, and rapidly collapsed after his death, with both Assyria and southern Iraq, in the form of the [[Sealand Dynasty]], falling back into native Akkadian hands. The foreign Amorites clung on to power in a once more weak and small Babylonia until it was sacked by the [[Indo-European]] speaking [[Hittite Empire]] based in [[Anatolia]] in 1595 BC. After this, another foreign people, the [[Language Isolate]] speaking [[Kassites]], originating in the [[Zagros Mountains]] of [[Ancient Iran]], seized control of Babylonia, where they were to rule for almost 600 years, by far the longest dynasty ever to rule in Babylon.\n\nIraq was from this point divided into three polities: [[Assyria]] in the north, [[Kassite]] [[Babylonia]] in the south central region, and the [[Sealand Dynasty]] in the far south. The Sealand Dynasty was finally conquered by Kassite Babylonia circa 1380 BC.\n\nThe [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365\u20131020 BC) saw Assyria rise to be the most powerful nation in the known world. Beginning with the campaigns of [[Ashur-uballit I]], Assyria destroyed the rival [[Hurrian]]-[[Mitanni]] Empire, annexed huge swathes of the [[Hittite Empire]] for itself, annexed northern Babylonia from the Kassites, forced the [[Egyptian Empire]] from the region, and defeated the [[Elamites]], [[Phrygians]], [[Canaanites]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Cilicians]], [[Gutians]], [[Dilmun]]ites and [[Arameans]]. At its height, the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] stretched from [[The Caucasus]] to [[Dilmun]] (modern [[Bahrain]]), and from the [[Mediterranean]] coasts of [[Phoenicia]] to the [[Zagros Mountains]] of [[Iran]]. In 1235 BC, [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] of Assyria took the throne of [[Babylon]], thus becoming the very first ''native Mesopotamian'' to rule the state.\n\n[[File:Jehu-Obelisk-cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Jehu]], king of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], bows before Shalmaneser III of [[Assyria]], 825 BC.]]\nDuring the [[Bronze Age collapse]] (1200-900 BC), Babylonia was in a state of chaos, dominated for long periods by Assyria and [[Elam]]. The Kassites were driven from power by Assyria and Elam, allowing native south Mesopotamian kings to rule Babylonia for the first time, although often subject to Assyrian or Elamite rulers. However, these [[East Semitic languages|East Semitic]] Akkadian kings, were unable to prevent new waves of [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] migrants entering southern Iraq, and during the 11th century BC [[Arameans]] and [[Suteans]] entered Babylonia from [[The Levant]], and these were followed in the late 10th to early 9th century BC by the migrant [[Chaldea]]ns who were closely related to the earlier [[Arameans]].\n\nAfter a period of comparative decline in Assyria, it once more began to expand with the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] (935\u2013605 BC). This was to be the largest and most powerful empire the world had yet seen, and under rulers such as [[Adad-Nirari II]], [[Ashurnasirpal I|Ashurnasirpal]], [[Shalmaneser III]], [[Semiramis]], [[Tiglath-pileser III]], [[Sargon II]], [[Sennacherib]], [[Esarhaddon]] and [[Ashurbanipal]], Iraq became the centre of an empire stretching from [[Persia]], [[Parthia]] and [[Elam]] in the east, to [[Cyprus]] and [[Antioch]] in the west, and from [[The Caucasus]] in the north to [[Egypt]], [[Nubia]] and [[Arabia]] in the south.\n\nThe [[Arab people|Arabs]] are first mentioned in written history (circa 850 BC) as a subject people of [[Shalmaneser III]], dwelling in the Arabian Peninsula. The [[Chaldea]]ns are also first mentioned at this time.\n\nIt was during this period that an Akkadian influenced form of [[Eastern Aramaic]] was introduced by the Assyrians as the [[lingua franca]] of their vast empire, and Mesopotamian Aramaic began to supplant Akkadian as the spoken language of the general populace of both Assyria and Babylonia. The descendant dialects of this tongue survive amongst the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] of northern Iraq to this day.\n\n[[File:Loewenjagd -645-635 Niniveh.JPG|thumb|Relief showing a [[Lion hunting|lion hunt]], from the north palace of [[Nineveh]], 645-635 BC.]]\nIn the late 7th century BC, the Assyrian Empire tore itself apart with a series of brutal civil wars, weakening itself to such a degree that a coalition of its former subjects; the [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Parthians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]], were able to attack Assyria, finally bringing its empire down by 605 BC.<ref>Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq</ref>\n\nThe short-lived [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (620-539 BC) succeeded that of Assyria. It failed to attain the size, power or longevity of its predecessor; however, it came to dominate [[The Levant]], [[Canaan]], [[Arabia]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], and to defeat [[Egypt]]. Initially, Babylon was ruled by yet another foreign dynasty, that of the [[Chaldea]]ns, who had migrated to the region in the late 10th or early 9th century BC. Its greatest king, [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], rivalled another non native ruler, the ethnically unrelated [[Amorite]] king [[Hammurabi]], as the greatest king of Babylon. However, by 556 BC, the Chaldeans had been deposed from power by the Assyrian born [[Nabonidus]] and his son and regent [[Belshazzar]].\n\nIn the 6th century BC, [[Cyrus the Great]] of neighbouring [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] defeated the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] at the [[Battle of Opis]] and Iraq was subsumed into the [[Achaemenid Empire]] for nearly two centuries. The Achaemenids made [[Babylon]] their main capital. The Chaldeans and Chaldea disappeared at around this time, though both Assyria and Babylonia endured and thrived under Achaemenid rule (see [[Achaemenid Assyria]]). Little changed under the Persians, having spent three centuries under Assyrian rule, their kings saw themselves as successors to Ashurbanipal, and they retained Assyrian Imperial Aramaic as the language of empire, together with the Assyrian imperial infrastructure, and an Assyrian style of art and architecture.\n\n[[File:Diadochen1.png|thumb|The Greek-ruled [[Seleucid Empire]] (in yellow) with capital in [[Seleucia]] on the Tigris, north of Babylon.]]\nIn the late 4th century BC, [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the region, putting it under [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] rule for over two centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/~kelseydb/Excavation/Seleucia.html |title=Seleucia on the Tigris |publisher=Umich.edu |date=1927-12-29 |accessdate=2011-06-19}}</ref> The Seleucids introduced the [[Indo-Anatolian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''Syria'' to the region.

During the 240s and 250's AD, the Sassanids gradually conquered the small Neo Assyrian states, culminating with Assur in 256 AD. The region was thus a province of the [[Sassanid Empire]] for over four centuries (see also; [[As\u014drist\u0101n]]), and became the frontier and battle ground between the Sassanid Empire and [[Byzantine Empire]], with both empires weakening each other greatly, paving the way for the [[Arab]]-[[Muslim conquest of Persia]] in the mid-7th century.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Abbasid Caliphate and Umayyad Emirate.png|thumb|350px|Baghdad was the capital of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], c. 755.]]\nThe Arab Islamic conquest in the mid-7th century AD established [[Islam]] in Iraq and saw a large influx of [[Arabs]].
