Typically it is measured by volume, but for some applications it is necessary to measure it by mass.  Air is a [[gas]], meaning its volume can vary with [[temperature]].\n\n==Units==\nTypical units to express airflow are:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comairrotron.com/airflow-unit-conversion |title=Airflow Unit Conversion |publisher=Comairrotron.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}</ref>\n\n===By volume===\n* l/s ([[litre]]s per [[second]])\n* m<sup>3</sup>/h ([[cubic metre]]s per [[hour]])\n* ft<sup>3</sup>/hr ([[Cubic foot|cubic feet]] per hour)\n\n===By mass===\n* kg/s ([[kilogram]]s per [[second]])\n\n==Measurement==\nThe instrument that measures airflow is called an [[airflow meter]].\n\n==Control==\nThe equipment that regulates the airflow is called a [[Damper (flow)|damper]]. The damper can be used to increase, decrease or completely stop the flow of air. A more complex device that can not only regulate the airflow but also has the ability to create an airflow is an [[air handler]].\n\n==Uses==\nMeasuring the airflow is necessary in many applications such as [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] (to determine how much air is being replaced) and engines (to control the [[Air\u2013fuel ratio]]).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Volumetric flow rate]]\n* [[Air flow meter]]\n* [[Damper (flow)]]\n* [[Air handling unit]]\n*[[Fluid dynamics]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning]]\n[[Category:Mechanical engineering]]"}]}}}}
