This cup measures volume in units of [[Cup (unit)|cups]], [[fluid ounce]]s, and [[millilitre]]s.]]\n'''Volume''' is the [[quantity]] of [[three-dimensional space]] enclosed by a [[closed surface]], for example, the space that a substance ([[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]], or [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]) or shape occupies or contains.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/volume |title= Your Dictionary entry for \"volume\" |accessdate=2010-05-01}}\n</ref>\nVolume is often quantified numerically using the [[SI derived unit]], the [[cubic metre]]. The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container, i. e. the amount of fluid (gas or liquid) that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces.\n\nThree dimensional mathematical shapes are also assigned volumes. Volumes of some simple shapes, such as regular, straight-edged, and circular shapes can be easily calculated using [[arithmetic]] [[formula]]s<!--- both \"formulae\" and \"formulas\" are correct plurals of \"formula\" --->. Volumes of a complicated shape can be calculated by [[integral calculus]] if a formula exists for the shape's boundary. Where a variance in shape and volume occurs, such as those that exist between different human beings, these can be calculated using three-dimensional techniques such as the [[Body Volume Index]]. One-dimensional figures (such as [[line (mathematics)|lines]]) and two-dimensional shapes (such as [[square (geometry)|squares]]) are assigned zero volume in the three-dimensional space.\n\nThe volume of a solid (whether regularly or irregularly shaped) can be determined by [[Displacement (fluid)|fluid displacement]]. Displacement of liquid can also be used to determine the volume of a gas. The combined volume of two substances is usually greater than the volume of one of the substances. However, sometimes one substance dissolves in the other and the combined volume is not [[additive map|additive]].<ref>One litre of sugar (about 970 grams) can dissolve in 0.6 litres of hot water, producing a total volume of less than one litre. {{cite web |url=http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/ch18/soluble.php |title=Solubility |accessdate=2010-05-01 |quote=Up to 1800 grams of sucrose can dissolve in a liter of water.}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[differential geometry]]'', volume is expressed by means of the [[volume form]], and is an important global [[Riemannian geometry|Riemannian]] [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]].\nIn ''[[thermodynamics]]'', volume is a [[gas volume|fundamental parameter]], and is a [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate variable]] to [[pressure]].\n\n==Units==\n[[File:Volume measurements from The New Student's Reference Work.svg|thumb|220px|Volume measurements from the 1914 [[s:The New Student's Reference Work|The New Student's Reference Work]].<br/>\n'''Approximate conversion to millilitres:'''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/appxc.cfm#4e |title=General Tables of Units of Measurement |author= |date= |work= |publisher=NIST Weights and Measures Division |accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref>\n{| style=\"width:200px;\"\n|-\n!  !!

For example, a [[cubic centimetre]] (cm<sup>3</sup>) is the volume of a cube whose sides are one [[centimetre]] (1&nbsp;cm) in length.\n\nIn the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the standard unit of volume is the cubic metre (m<sup>3</sup>).  The [[metric system]] also includes the [[litre]] (L) as a unit of volume, where one litre is the volume of a 10-centimetre cube.  Thus\n:1 litre = (10 cm)<sup>3</sup> = 1000 cubic centimetres = 0.001 cubic metres,\n\nso\n:1 cubic metre = 1000 litres.\nSmall amounts of liquid are often measured in [[millilitre]]s, where\n:1 millilitre = 0.001 litres = 1 cubic centimetre.\n\nVarious other traditional units of volume are also in use, including the [[cubic inch]], the [[cubic foot]], the [[cubic mile]], the [[teaspoon]], the [[tablespoon]], the [[fluid ounce]], the [[fluid dram]], the [[gill (volume)|gill]], the [[pint]], the [[quart]], the [[gallon]], the [[minim (unit)|minim]], the [[barrel (unit)|barrel]], the [[cord (unit)|cord]], the [[peck]], the [[bushel]], and the [[hogshead]].\n\n== Related terms ==\n''Capacity'' is defined by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] as \"the measure applied to the content of a vessel, and to liquids, grain, or the like, which take the shape of that which holds them\".<ref>{{OED|capacity}}</ref> (The word ''capacity'' has other unrelated meanings, as in e.g. [[capacity management]].) Capacity is not identical in meaning to volume, though closely related; the capacity of a container is always the volume in its interior. Units of capacity are the [[SI]] litre and its derived units, and Imperial units such as [[Gill (unit)|gill]], [[pint]], [[gallon]], and others. Units of volume are the cubes of [[units of length]]. In SI the units of volume and capacity are closely related: one litre is exactly 1 cubic decimetre, the capacity of a cube with a 10&nbsp;cm side. In other systems the conversion is not trivial; the capacity of a vehicle's fuel tank is rarely stated in cubic feet, for example, but in gallons (a gallon fills a volume of 0.1605 cu ft).\n\nThe ''[[density]]'' of an object is defined as the ratio of the mass to the volume.<ref>{{OED|density}}</ref> The inverse of density is ''[[specific volume]]'' which is defined as volume divided by mass. Specific volume is a concept important in [[thermodynamics]] where the [[volume (thermodynamics)|volume of a working fluid]] is often an important parameter of a system being studied.\n\nThe [[volumetric flow rate]] in [[fluid dynamics]] is the volume of fluid which passes through a given surface per unit time (for example cubic meters per second [m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>]).\n\n== Volume in calculus ==\n{{further|Volume element}}\n\nIn [[calculus]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the volume of a region ''D'' in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> is given by a [[multiple integral|triple integral]] of the constant [[function (mathematics)|function]] <math>f(x,y,z)=1</math> and is usually written as:\n\n:<math>\\iiint\\limits_D 1 \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz.</math>\n\nThe volume integral in [[cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]] is\n\n:<math>\\iiint\\limits_D r\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\,dz, </math>\n\nand the volume integral in [[spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]] (using the convention for angles with <math>\\theta</math> as the azimuth and <math>\\phi</math> measured from the polar axis (see more on [[Spherical coordinate system#Conventions|conventions]])) has the form\n\n:<math>\\iiint\\limits_D \\rho^2 \\sin\\phi \\,d\\rho \\,d\\theta\\, d\\phi .</math>\n\n== Volume formulas ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Shape || Volume formula || Variables\n|-\n|[[Cube (geometry)|Cube]]  \n|style=\"text-align:center\"|<math>B^3\\;</math>\n|''a'' = length of any side (or edge)\n|-\n|[[cylinder (geometry)|Cylinder]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|<math>\\pi r^2 h\\;</math> \n|''r'' = radius of circular face, ''h'' = height\n|-\n|[[Prism (geometry)|Prism]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|<math>B \\cdot h</math>\n|''B'' = area of the base, ''h'' = height\n|-\n|[[Rectangular prism]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|<math>l \\cdot w \\cdot h</math>\n|l = length, w = width, h = height\n|-\n|[[Triangular prism]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|<math>\\frac{1}{2}bhl</math>\n|''b'' = base length of triangle, ''h'' = height of triangle, ''l'' = length of prism or distance between the triangular bases\n|-\n|[[Sphere]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|<math>\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3</math> \n|''r'' = radius of sphere<br>which is the [[integral]] of the [[surface area]] of a sphere\n|-\n|[[Ellipsoid]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|<math>\\frac{4}{3} \\pi abc</math> \n|''a'', ''b'', ''c'' = semi-axes of ellipsoid\n|-\n|[[Torus]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|<math>(\\pi r^2)(2\\pi R) = 2\\pi^2 Rr^2</math>\n|''r'' = minor radius (radius of the tube), ''R'' = major radius (distance from center of tube to center of torus)\n|-\n|[[Pyramid (geometry)|Pyramid]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|<math>\\frac{1}{3}Bh</math>\n|''B'' = area of the base, ''h'' = height of pyramid\n|-\n|[[Square pyramid]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|<math>\\frac{1}{3} s^2 h\\;</math> \n|''s'' = side length of base, ''h'' = height\n|-\n|[[Rectangular]] [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|<math>\\frac{1}{3} lwh</math>\n|l = length, w = width, h = height\n|-\n|[[Cone (geometry)|Cone]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|<math>\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h</math>\n|''r'' = radius of [[circle]] at base, ''h'' = distance from base to tip or height\n|-\n|[[Tetrahedron]]<ref name=Cox>[[H.

A manifold has a volume form if and only if it is orientable. An orientable manifold has infinitely many volume forms, since multiplying a volume form by a non-vanishing function yields another volume form. On non-orientable manifolds, one may instead define the weaker notion of a [[Density on a manifold|density]]. Integrating the volume form gives the volume of the manifold according to that form.\n\nAny [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian]] (or [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian]]) [[manifold]] has a natural volume (or pseudo volume) form.  In [[local coordinates]], it can be expressed as\n:<math>\\omega = \\sqrt{|g|} dx^1\\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^n</math>\nwhere the <math>dx^i</math> are the [[1-form]]s providing an oriented basis for the [[cotangent bundle]] of the ''n''-dimensional manifold.  Here, <math>|g|</math> is the absolute value of the [[determinant]] of the matrix representation of the [[metric tensor]] on the manifold.\n\n== Volume in thermodynamics ==\n{{Main| Volume (thermodynamics)}}\n\nIn [[thermodynamics]], the '''volume''' of a [[thermodynamic system|system]] is an important [[extensive parameter]] for describing its [[thermodynamic state]]. The '''specific volume''', an [[intensive property]], is the system's volume per unit of mass. Volume is a [[function of state]] and is interdependent with other thermodynamic properties such as [[pressure]] and [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]]. For example, volume is related to the [[pressure]] and [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]] of an [[ideal gas]] by the [[ideal gas law]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{cmn|3|\n* [[Area]]\n* [[Banach\u2013Tarski paradox]]\n* [[Conversion of units#Volume|Conversion of units]]\n* [[Dimensional weight]]\n* [[Dimensioning]]\n* [[Length]]\n* [[Mass]]\n* [[Measure (mathematics)|Measure]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude (volume)]]\n* [[Perimeter]]\n* [[Volume (thermodynamics)]]\n* [[Weight]]\n* [[Volumography]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikibooks|Geometry|Chapter 8|Perimeters, Areas, Volumes}}\n{{wikibooks|Calculus|Volume}}\n\n[[Category:Volume|*]]"}]}}}}
