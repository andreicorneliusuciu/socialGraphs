Voltage drops across [[internal resistance]]s of the source, across [[Electrical conductor|conductors]], across [[Electrical contact|contacts]], and across [[Electrical connector|connectors]] are undesired as the supplied energy is lost (dissipated). Voltage drops across [[Electrical load|loads]] and across other active circuit elements are desired as the supplied energy performs useful work.\n\nFor example, an electric space heater may have a resistance of ten [[ohm]]s, and the wires which supply it may have a resistance of 0.2 ohms, about 2% of the total circuit resistance.  This means that approximately 2% of the supplied voltage is lost in the wire itself.  Excessive voltage drop may result in unsatisfactory operation of, and damage to, electrical and electronic equipment.\n\nNational and local [[electrical code]]s may set guidelines for the maximum voltage drop allowed in [[electrical wiring]], to ensure efficiency of distribution and proper operation of electrical equipment.  The maximum permitted voltage drop varies from one country to another.<ref>[http://www.electrical-installation.schneider-electric.com/voltage-drop.htm]</ref>  In electronic design and power transmission, various techniques are employed to compensate for the effect of voltage drop on long circuits or where voltage levels must be accurately maintained.  The simplest way to reduce voltage drop is to increase the diameter of the conductor between the source and the load, which lowers the overall resistance. In power distribution systems, a given amount of power can be transmitted with less voltage drop if a higher voltage is used. More sophisticated techniques use active elements to compensate for the undesired voltage drop.\n\n==Voltage drop in direct-current circuits: resistance==\n\nConsider a direct-current circuit with a nine-volt [[direct current|DC]] source; three [[resistor]]s of 67 [[ohm]]s, 100 ohms, and 470 ohms; and a light bulb\u2014all connected in [[Series circuit|series]]. The DC source, the conductors (wires), the resistors, and the light bulb (the [[electrical load|load]]) all have [[Electrical resistance|resistance]]; all use and dissipate supplied energy to some degree. Their physical characteristics determine how much energy. For example, the DC resistance of a conductor depends upon the conductor's length, cross-sectional area, type of material, and temperature.\n\nIf the voltage between the DC source and the first resistor (67 ohms) is measured, the voltage potential at the first resistor will be slightly less than nine volts. The current passes through the conductor (wire) from the DC source to the first resistor; as this occurs, some of the supplied energy is \"lost\" (unavailable to the load), due to the resistance of the conductor. Voltage drop exists in both the supply and return wires of a circuit. If the voltage across each resistor is measured, the measurement will be a significant number. That represents the energy used by the resistor. The larger the resistor, the more energy used by that resistor, and the bigger the voltage drop across that resistor.\n\n[[Ohm's Law]] can be used to verify voltage drop. In a DC circuit, voltage equals current multiplied by resistance. <math>V = I R</math>. Also, [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] state that in any DC circuit, the sum of the voltage drops across each component of the circuit is equal to the supply voltage.\n\n==Voltage drop in alternating-current circuits: impedance==\n\nIn [[alternating current|alternating-current]] circuits, opposition to current flow occurs because of resistance, just as in direct-current circuits. However, alternating current circuits also include a second kind of opposition to current flow: [[Electrical reactance|reactance]]. The sum of oppositions to current flow from both resistance and reactance is called [[Electrical impedance|impedance]].\n\nElectrical impedance is commonly represented by the variable ''Z'' and measured in ohms at a specific frequency. Electrical impedance is computed as the [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] sum of [[electrical resistance]], [[capacitive reactance]], and [[inductive reactance]].\n\nThe amount of impedance in an alternating-current circuit depends on the frequency of the alternating current and the magnetic permeability of electrical conductors and electrically isolated elements (including surrounding elements), which varies with their size and spacing.\n\nAnalogous to [[Ohm's law]] for direct-current circuits, electrical impedance may be expressed by the formula <math>E = I Z</math>. So, the voltage drop in an AC circuit is the product of the current and the impedance of the circuit.\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|2}}\n*[[Voltage droop]]\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n*[[Brownout (electricity)|Utility brownout]]\n*[[Voltage divider]]\n* [[Electrical distribution]]\n*[[Kirchhoff's voltage law]]\n*[[Electrical conduction]]\n*[[Ground loop (electricity)]]\n*[[Power cable]]\n*[[Mesh analysis]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n<references />\n*Electrical Principles for the Electrical Trades (Jim Jennesson) 5th edition\n\n==External links==\n*[http://mc-group.ca/download.htm Freeware NEC Tables, CEC Tables and Electrical Calculation for your PC]\n*[http://www.engineersedge.com/instrumentation/voltage_drop_calculator/wire_voltage_drop_calculator_12928.htm Voltage Drop Calculator]\n*[http://www.mypq.net/tools/voltagedrop.asp EPRI Power Quality - Voltage Drop Calculator]\n*[http://wiki.diyfaq.org.uk/index.php?title=Cables#Voltage_Drop Voltage drop of British mains cables]\n* [http://myelectrical.com/tools/cable-sizing-calculator BS 7671:2008 Cable Sizing Tool]\n*[http://www.bbowner.co.uk/volt-drop-cable-size-calculator.html Cable Size & Volt Drop Calculator UK]\n\n\n[[Category:Electricity]]\n[[Category:Electrical parameters]]\n[[Category:Cables]]\n[[Category:Voltage stability|Drop]]"}]}}}}
