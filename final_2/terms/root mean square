It is easy to do the calculation when there is a constant [[electric current|current]], ''I'', through the resistance. For a load of ''R'' ohms, power is defined simply as:\n\n:<math>P = I^2 R.</math>\n\nHowever, if the current is a time-varying function, ''I(t)'', this formula must be extended to reflect the fact that the current (and thus the instantaneous power) is varying over time. If the function is periodic (such as household AC power), it is still meaningful to discuss the ''average'' power dissipated over time, which is calculated by taking the average power dissipation:\n:{| border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0\n|-\n|<math>P_\\text{avg}\\,\\!</math>\n|<math>{} = \\left\\langle I(t)^2R \\right\\rangle \\,\\!</math> (where <math>\\langle \\ldots \\rangle</math> denotes the [[Mean#Mean of a function|mean]] of a function)\n|-\n|\n|<math>{} = R\\left\\langle I(t)^2 \\right\\rangle\\,\\!</math> (as ''R'' does not vary over time, it can be factored out)\n|-\n|\n|<math>{} = I_\\text{RMS}^2R\\,\\!</math> (by definition of RMS)\n|}\nSo, the RMS value, ''I''<sub>RMS</sub>, of the function ''I(t)'' is the constant current that yields the same power dissipation as the time-averaged power dissipation of the current ''I(t)''.\n\nAverage power can also be found using the same method that in the case of a time-varying [[voltage]], ''V(t)'', with RMS value ''V''<sub>RMS</sub>,\n\n:<math>P_\\text{Avg} = {V_\\text{RMS}^2 \\over R}.</math>\n\nThis equation can be used for any periodic [[waveform]], such as a [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] or [[sawtooth wave]]form, allowing us to calculate the mean power delivered into a specified load.\n\nBy taking the square root of both these equations and multiplying them together, the power is found to be:\n\n:<math>P_\\text{Avg} = V_\\text{RMS}I_\\text{RMS}.</math>\n\nBoth derivations depend on voltage and current being proportional (i.e., the load, ''R'', is purely resistive). [[Electrical reactance|Reactive]] loads (i.e., loads capable of not just dissipating energy but also storing it) are discussed under the topic of [[AC power]].\n\nIn the common case of [[alternating current]] when ''I(t)'' is a [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] current, as is approximately true for mains power, the RMS value is easy to calculate from the continuous case equation above. If ''I''<sub>p</sub> is defined to be the peak current, then:\n\n:<math>I_\\text{RMS} = \\sqrt{{1 \\over {T_2 - T_1}} \\int_{T_1}^{T_2} \\left[I_\\text{p} \\sin(\\omega t)\\right]^2 dt}.\\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere ''t'' is time and ''\u03c9'' is the [[angular frequency]] (''\u03c9''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2\u03c0/''T'', where ''T'' is the period of the wave).\n\nSince ''I''<sub>p</sub> is a positive constant:\n\n:<math>I_\\text{RMS} = I_\\text{p} \\sqrt{{1 \\over {T_2 - T_1}} {\\int_{T_1}^{T_2} {\\sin^2(\\omega t)}\\, dt}}.</math>\n\nUsing a [[list of trigonometric identities|trigonometric identity]] to eliminate squaring of trig function:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  I_\\text{RMS} &= I_\\text{p} \\sqrt{{1 \\over {T_2 - T_1}} {\\int_{T_1}^{T_2} {{1 - \\cos(2\\omega t) \\over 2}}\\, dt}} \\\\\n  I_\\text{RMS} &= I_\\text{p} \\sqrt{{1 \\over {T_2 - T_1}} \\left[ {t \\over 2} - {\\sin(2\\omega t) \\over 4\\omega} \\right]_{T_1}^{T_2} }\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nbut since the interval is a whole number of complete cycles (per definition of RMS), the ''sin'' terms will cancel out, leaving:\n\n:<math>I_{\\text{RMS}} = I_\\text{p} \\sqrt{{1 \\over {T_2 - T_1}} \\left[ {{t \\over 2}} \\right]_{T_1}^{T_2} } = I_\\text{p} \\sqrt{{1 \\over {T_2 - T_1}} {{{T_2 - T_1} \\over 2}} } = {I_\\text{p} \\over \\sqrt{2}}.</math>\n\nA similar analysis leads to the analogous equation for sinusoidal voltage:\n\n:<math>V_\\text{RMS} = {V_\\text{p} \\over {\\sqrt 2}}.</math>\n\nWhere ''I''<sub>P</sub> represents the peak current and ''V''<sub>P</sub> represents the peak voltage.\n\nBecause of their usefulness in carrying out power calculations, listed [[voltage]]s for power outlets (e.g., 120 V in the USA, or 230 V in Europe) are almost always quoted in RMS values, and not peak values. Peak values can be calculated from RMS values from the above formula, which implies ''V''{{sub|P}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;''V''<sub>RMS</sub>&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;\u221a2, assuming the source is a pure sine wave. Thus the peak value of the mains voltage in the USA is about 120&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;\u221a2, or about 170 volts. The peak-to-peak voltage, being double this, is about 340 volts. A similar calculation indicates that the peak mains voltage in Europe is about 325 volts, and the peak-to-peak mains voltage, about 650 volts.\n\nRMS quantities such as electric current are usually calculated over one cycle.  However, for some purposes the RMS current over a longer period is required when calculating transmission power losses.  The same principle applies, and (for example) a current of 10 amps used for 12 hours each day represents an RMS current of 5 amps in the long term.\n\nThe term \"RMS power\" is sometimes erroneously used in the audio industry as a synonym for \"mean power\" or \"average power\" (it is proportional to the square of the RMS voltage or RMS current in a resistive load). For a discussion of audio power measurements and their shortcomings, see [[Audio power]].\n\n===Root-mean-square speed===\n{{main article|Root-mean-square speed}}\n\nIn the [[physics]] of [[gas]] molecules, the '''root-mean-square speed''' is defined as the square root of the average squared-speed. The RMS speed of an ideal gas is [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution#Distribution for the velocity vector|calculated]] using the following equation:\n\n:<math>{v_\\text{RMS}} = {\\sqrt{3RT \\over {M}}}</math>\n\nwhere ''R'' represents the [[ideal gas constant]], 8.314&nbsp;J/(mol\u00b7K), ''T'' is the temperature of the gas in [[kelvin]]s, and ''M'' is the [[molar mass]] of the gas in kilograms. The generally accepted terminology for speed as compared to velocity is that the former is the scalar magnitude of the latter. Therefore, although the average speed is between zero and the RMS speed, the average velocity for a stationary gas is zero.\n\n===Root-mean-square error===\n{{Main article|Root-mean-square error}}\nWhen two data sets\u2014one set from theoretical prediction and the other from actual measurement of some physical variable, for instance\u2014are compared, the RMS of the pairwise differences of the two data sets can serve as a measure how far on average the error is from 0.\n\nThe [[mean]] of the pairwise differences does not measure the variability of the difference, and the variability as indicated by the [[standard deviation]] is around the mean instead of 0. Therefore, the RMS of the differences is a meaningful measure of the error.\n\n==RMS in frequency domain==\nThe RMS can be computed in the frequency domain, using [[Parseval's theorem]]. For a sampled signal <math>x[n]=x(t=nT)</math>, where <math>T</math> is the sampling period,\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^N{x^2[n]} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{m=1}^N \\bigl| X[m] \\bigr|^2</math>,\n\nwhere <math>X[m] = \\operatorname{FFT}\\{x[n]\\}</math> and ''N'' is number of samples and FFT coefficients.\n\nIn this case, the RMS computed in the time domain is the same as in the frequency domain:\n\n:<math>\n  \\mathrm{RMS}\\{x[n]\\}\n    = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_n{x^2[n]}}\n    = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_m{\\bigl| X[m] \\bigr|}^2}\n    = \\sqrt{\\sum_m{\\left| \\frac{X[m]}{N} \\right|^2}}.\n</math>\n\n==Relationship to other statistics==\nIf <math>\\bar{x}</math> is the [[arithmetic mean]] and <math>\\sigma_{x}</math> is the [[standard deviation]] of a [[Statistical Population|population]] or a [[waveform]] then:<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = Digital signal transmission\n | edition = 2nd\n | author = Chris C.
