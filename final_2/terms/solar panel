A photovoltaic system typically includes a panel or an array of solar modules, a [[solar inverter]], and sometimes a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] and/or [[solar tracker]] and interconnection wiring.\n\nThe price of solar power has continued to fall so that in many countries it is cheaper than ordinary [[fossil fuel]] electricity from the grid (there is \"[[grid parity]]\").<ref name=UN-Energy-2012/>\n\n== Theory and construction ==\n{{See also|Solar cell}}\n[[File:From a solar cell to a PV system.svg|thumb|From a [[solar cell]] to a [[PV system]]]]\n\nSolar modules use light energy   ([[photon]]s) from the sun to generate electricity through the [[photovoltaic effect]]. The majority of modules use [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]-based [[crystalline silicon]] cells or [[Thin film solar cell|thin-film cells]] based on [[cadmium telluride]] or [[silicon]]. The structural ([[Dead and live loads|load carrying]]) member of a module can either be the top layer or the back layer. Cells must also be protected from mechanical damage and moisture. Most solar modules are rigid, but semi-flexible ones are available, based on thin-film cells.\n\nElectrical connections are made [[Series circuits|in series]] to achieve a desired output voltage and/or [[Parallel circuits|in parallel]] to provide a desired current capability. The conducting wires that take the current off the modules may contain silver, copper or other non-magnetic conductive [transition metals]. The cells must be connected electrically to one another and to the rest of the system. Externally, popular terrestrial usage photovoltaic modules use [[MC3 connector|MC3]] (older) or [[MC4 connector]]s to facilitate easy weatherproof connections to the rest of the system.\n\nBypass [[diode]]s may be incorporated or used externally, in case of partial module shading, to maximize the output of module sections still illuminated.\n\nSome recent solar module designs include [[Solar concentrator|concentrators]] in which light is focused by [[lens (optics)|lenses]] or mirrors onto an array of smaller cells. This enables the use of cells with a high cost per unit area (such as [[gallium arsenide]]) in a cost-effective way.\n\nThere is also hotspot effect in solar modules in which two sides of cells are connected two diodes, this prevents solar modules or panels from short circuit.\n\n== Efficiencies ==\n{{See also|Solar cell efficiency}}\n[[File:Best Research-Cell Efficiencies.png|thumb|350px|Reported timeline of [[solar cell]] energy conversion efficiencies since 1976 ([[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]])]]\n\nDepending on construction, photovoltaic modules can produce electricity from a range of [[frequency|frequencies of light]], but usually cannot cover the entire solar range (specifically, [[ultraviolet]], [[infrared]] and low or diffused light). Hence, much of the incident [[sunlight]] energy is wasted by solar modules, and they can give far higher efficiencies if illuminated with [[monochromatic]] light. Therefore, another design concept is to split the light into different wavelength ranges and direct the beams onto different cells tuned to those ranges.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} This has been projected to be capable of raising efficiency by 50%. Scientists from Spectrolab, a subsidiary of [[Boeing]], have reported development of [[multi-junction solar cell]]s with an efficiency of more than 40%, a new world record for solar photovoltaic cells.<ref>KING, R.R., et al., Appl. Phys. Letters 90 (2007) 183516.</ref> The Spectrolab scientists also predict that concentrator solar cells could achieve efficiencies of more than 45% or even 50% in the future, with theoretical efficiencies being about 58% in cells with more than three junctions.\n\nCurrently the best achieved sunlight conversion rate (solar module efficiency) is around 21.5% in new commercial products<ref>{{cite web|title=SunPower e20 Module|url=http://us.sunpower.com/homes/products-services/solar-panels/e-series/}}</ref> typically lower than the efficiencies of their cells in isolation.

The [[Light scattering|scattered]] [[light]] then travels along a longer path in the semiconductor which means that more photons can be absorbed and converted into current. Although these nanocylinders have been used previously (aluminum was preceded by [[gold]] and [[silver]]), the light scattering occurred in the near infrared region and visible light was absorbed strongly. Aluminum was found to have absorbed the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, while the visible and near infrared parts of the spectrum were found to be scattered by the aluminum surface. This, the research argued, could bring down the cost significantly and improve the efficiency as aluminum is more abundant and less costly than gold and silver. The research also noted that the increase in current makes thinner film solar panels technically feasible without \"compromising power conversion efficiencies, thus reducing material consumption\".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/improving-the-efficiency-of-solar-panels/article5265330.ece|title=Improving the efficiency of solar panels|publisher=The Hindu|date=24 October 2013|accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>\n* Efficiencies of solar panel can be calculated by MPP (Maximum power point) value of solar panels\n* [[Solar inverter]]s convert the DC power to AC power by performing MPPT process: solar inverter samples the output Power (I-V curve) from the solar cell and applies the proper resistance (load) to solar cells to obtain maximum power.\n* MPP (Maximum power point) of the solar panel consists of MPP voltage (V mpp) and MPP current (I mpp): it is a capacity of the solar panel and the higher value can make higher MPP.\n\nMicro-inverted solar panels are wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]] which produces more output than normal panels which are wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]] with the output of the series determined by the lowest performing panel (this is known as the \"Christmas light effect\"). Micro-inverters work independently so each panel contributes its maximum possible output given the available sunlight.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Micro Inverters for Residential Solar Arrays|url = http://www.solarcompared.co.uk/micro-inverters-for-residential-solar-arrays/|accessdate = 2015-09-29}}</ref>\n\n== Technology ==\n{{Main article|Crystalline silicon|Thin film solar cell}}\n[[File:Global Market Share by PV Technology from 1990 to 2013.svg|thumb|Market-share of PV technologies since 1990]]\n\nMost solar modules are currently produced from crystalline silicon (c-Si) [[solar cells]] made of [[polycrystalline silicon|multicrystalline]] and [[monocrystalline silicon]]. In 2013, crystalline silicon accounted for more than 90 percent of worldwide PV production, while the rest of the overall market is made up of [[thin film solar cells|thin-film technologies]] using [[CdTe PV|cadmium telluride]], [[CIGS panel|CIGS]] and [[amorphous silicon]]<ref>[http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf Photovoltaics Report, Fraunhofer ISE, 28 July 2014], pages 18,19</ref> Emerging, [[Thin film solar cell#Emerging photovoltaics|third generation]] solar technologies use advanced thin-film cells. They produce a relatively high-efficiency conversion for the low cost compared to other solar technologies. Also, high-cost, high-efficiency, and close-packed rectangular [[multi-junction solar cell|multi-junction (MJ) cell]]s are preferably used in [[solar panels on spacecraft]], as they offer the highest ratio of generated power per kilogram lifted into space. MJ-cells are [[compound semiconductor]]s and made of [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) and other semiconductor materials. Another emerging PV technology using MJ-cells is [[concentrator photovoltaics]] ( CPV ).\n\n=== Thin film ===\n\nIn rigid [[thin-film module]]s, the cell and the module are manufactured in the same production line. The cell is created on a glass [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] or superstrate, and the electrical connections are created ''in situ'', a so-called \"monolithic integration\". The substrate or superstrate is laminated with an encapsulant to a front or back [[wikt:sheet|sheet]], usually another sheet of glass. The main cell technologies in this category are [[Cadmium telluride|CdTe]], or [[amorphous silicon|a-Si]], or [[micromorphous silicon|a-Si+uc-Si tandem]], or [[Copper indium gallium selenide|CIGS]] (or variant). Amorphous silicon has a sunlight conversion rate of 6\u201312%\n\nFlexible thin film cells and modules are created on the same production line by depositing the [[photoactive layer]] and other necessary layers on a [[flexible substrate]]. If the substrate is an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] (e.g. [[polyester]] or [[polyimide]] film) then [[Die (integrated circuit)|monolithic]] integration can be used. If it is a conductor then another technique for electrical connection must be used. The cells are assembled into modules by [[laminating]] them to a transparent colourless [[fluoropolymer]] on the front side (typically [[ETFE]] or [[Fluorinated ethylene propylene|FEP]]) and a polymer suitable for bonding to the final substrate on the other side.\n\n== Smart solar modules ==\n{{main article|Smart module|Solar micro-inverter}}\n\nSeveral companies have begun embedding electronics into PV modules. This enables performing [[maximum power point tracking]] (MPPT) for each module individually, and the measurement of performance data for monitoring and fault detection at module level. Some of these solutions make use of [[power optimizer]]s, a DC-to-DC converter technology developed to maximize the power harvest from solar photovoltaic systems. As of about 2010, such electronics can also compensate for shading effects, wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to fall to zero, but not having the output of the entire module fall to zero.\n\n== Performance and degradation ==\n{{original research|section|date=August 2013}}\n\nModule performance is generally rated under standard test conditions (STC): [[irradiance]] of 1,000 [[W/m2|W/m\u00b2]], solar [[spectrum]] of [[Airmass|AM]] 1.5 and module temperature at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nElectrical characteristics include nominal power (P<sub>MAX</sub>, measured in [[watt|W]]), [[open circuit voltage]] (V<sub>OC</sub>), [[short circuit current]] (I<sub>SC</sub>, measured in [[ampere]]s), maximum power voltage (V<sub>MPP</sub>), maximum power current (I<sub>MPP</sub>), peak power, ([[watt-peak]], W<sub>p</sub>), and module efficiency (%).\n\nNominal voltage refers to the voltage of the battery that the module is best suited to charge; this is a leftover term from the days when solar modules were only used to charge batteries. The actual voltage output of the module changes as lighting, temperature and load conditions change, so there is never one specific voltage at which the module operates. Nominal voltage allows users, at a glance, to make sure the module is compatible with a given system.\n\nOpen circuit voltage or V<sub>OC</sub> is the maximum voltage that the module can produce when not connected to an electrical circuit or system. V<sub>OC</sub> can be measured with a [[voltmeter]] directly on an illuminated module's terminals or on its disconnected cable.\n\nThe peak power rating, W<sub>p</sub>, is the maximum output under standard test conditions (not the maximum possible output). Typical modules, which could measure approximately 1x2 meters or 2x4 feet, will be rated from as low as 75 watts to as high as 350 watts, depending on their efficiency. At the time of testing, the test modules are binned according to their test results, and a typical manufacturer might rate their modules in 5 watt increments, and either rate them at +/- 3%, +/-5%, +3/-0% or +5/-0%.<ref>[https://www.q-cells.com/fileadmin/Website_Relaunch_2014/4_Products/4.1_Solar_Modules/4.1.1_Q.PEAK-G3/Hanwha_Q_CELLS_Data_sheet_QPEAK-G3_265-280_2014_11_Rev08_EN.pdf]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixsolar-group.com/dms/produkte/module/pdf/en/FirstSolar_PD-5-401-03-Global-Series-3-Datasheet/PD-5-401-03%20Global%20Series%203%20Datasheet.pdf |title=First Solar \u2013 FS-377 / FS-380 / FS-382 / FS-385 Datasheet |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinasolar.com/images/PDF/datasheets/us/TSM-PA14_US.pdf |title=TSM PC/PM14 Datasheet |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yinglisolar.com/frontend/downloads/datasheets/YGE_235_Series_US.pdf |title=YGE 235 Data sheet |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref>\n\nSolar modules must withstand rain, [[hail]], heavy snow load, and cycles of heat and cold for many years.

This effect may cause power loss of up to 30 percent.\n\nThe largest challenge of photovoltaic technology is the efficiencies of such solar systems. While utilizing such systems draws a great interest due to the long term returns of profit, the efficacy needs to come a long way before making it plausible to be introduced in all consumers of electricity.\n\nThe problem resides in the enormous activation energy that must be overcome for a photon to excite an electron for harvesting purposes. Advancements in photovoltaic technologies have brought about the process of \"doping\" the silicon substrate to lower the activation energy thereby making the panel more efficient in converting photons to retrievable electrons.<ref>{{Cite web|title = How Solar Cells Work|url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/solar-cell2.htm|website = HowStuffWorks|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}</ref> Chemicals such as Boron (p-type) are applied into the semiconductor crystal in order to create donor and acceptor energy levels substantially closer to the valence and conductor [http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/section_16/6520efadc9fafd08d3043572e61e9765.jpg bands].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Bonding in Metals and Semiconductors|url = http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/s16-06-bonding-in-metals-and-semicond.html|website = 2012books.lardbucket.org|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}</ref> In doing so, the addition of Boron impurity allows the activation energy to decrease 20 fold from 1.12 eV to 0.05 eV. Since the potential difference (E<sub>B</sub>) is so low, the Boron is able to thermally ionize at room temperatures. This allows for free energy carriers in the conduction and valence bands thereby allowing greater conversion of photons to electrons.\n\nSolar power allows for greater efficiency than heat, such as the generation of energy in heat engines. The drawback with heat is that most of the heat created is lost to the surroundings. Thermal efficiency is as defined:\n\n<math>\\eta_{th} \\equiv \\frac{W_{out}}{Q_{in}} = 1 - \\frac{Q_{out}}{Q_{in}}</math>\n\nDue to the inherent irreversibility of heat production for useful work, efficiency levels are decreased. On the other hand, with solar panels there isn't a requirement to retain any heat, and there are no drawbacks such as friction.\n\n== Maintenance ==\n\nSolar panel conversion efficiency, typically in the 20 percent range, is reduced by dust, grime, pollen, and other particulates that accumulate on the solar panel. \"A dirty solar panel can reduce its power capabilities by up to 30 percent in high dust/pollen or desert areas\", says Seamus Curran, associate professor of physics at the University of Houston and director of the Institute for NanoEnergy, which specializes in the design, engineering, and assembly of nanostructures.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/energy/self-cleaning-solar-panels-maximize-efficiency |title=Self-Cleaning Solar Panels Maximize Efficiency |date=October 2012 |accessdate=15 September 2014 |website=The American Society of Mechanical Engineers |publisher=ASME |last=Crawford |first=Mike}}</ref>\n\nPaying to have solar panels cleaned is often not a good investment; researchers found panels that hadn\u2019t been cleaned, or rained on, for 145 days during a summer drought in California, lost only 7.4 percent of their efficiency. Overall, for a typical residential solar system of 5 kilowatts, washing panels halfway through the summer would translate into a mere $20 gain in electricity production until the summer drought ends\u2014in about 2 \u00bd months. For larger commercial rooftop systems, the financial losses are bigger but still rarely enough to warrant the cost of washing the panels. On average, panels lost a little less than 0.05 percent of their overall efficiency per day.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/cleaning_solar_panels_often_not_worth_the_cost_engineers_at_uc_san_diego_fi |title=Cleaning Solar Panels Often Not Worth the Cost, Engineers at UC San Diego Find |date=August 2013 |accessdate=31 May 2015 |website=UC San Diego News Center |publisher=UC San Diego News Center |last=Patringenaru |first=Ioana}}</ref>\n\n== Recycling ==\n\nMost parts of a solar module can be recycled including up to 97% of certain semiconductor materials or the glass as well as large amounts of ferrous and non-ferrous metals.<ref>Lisa Krueger. 1999. {{cite web |title=Overview of First Solar's Module Collection and Recycling Program |publisher=[[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] p. 23 |url=http://www.bnl.gov/pv/files/PRS_Agenda/2_Krueger_IEEE-Presentation-Final.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=August 2012}}</ref> Some private companies and non-profit organizations are currently engaged in take-back and recycling operations for end-of-life modules.<ref>Karsten Wambach. 1999. {{cite web |title=A Voluntary Take Back Scheme and Industrial Recycling of Photovoltaic Modules |publisher=[[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] p. 37 |url=http://www.bnl.gov/pv/files/PRS_Agenda/3_4_PV-Module-RecyclingWambach.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=August 2012}}</ref>\n\nRecycling possibilities depend on the kind of technology used in the modules:\n* Silicon based modules: aluminum frames and junction boxes are dismantled manually at the beginning of the process.

This point is sometimes called 'wholesale grid parity' or 'busbar parity'.<ref name=UN-Energy-2012>{{cite report |url=http://www.un-energy.org/stories/2498-re-considering-the-economics-of-photovoltaic-power |title=Re-considering the economics of photovoltaic power |author=Morgan Baziliana|work=UN-Energy |publisher=United Nations |date=17 May 2012 |accessdate=20 November 2012|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nSome photovoltaic systems, such as rooftop installations, can supply power directly to an electricity user. In these cases, the installation can be competitive when the output cost matches the price at which the user pays for his electricity consumption. This situation is sometimes called 'retail grid parity', 'socket parity' or 'dynamic grid parity'.<ref>{{cite web|title=Solar Photovoltaics competing in the energy sector \u2013 On the road to competitiveness| url=http://www.epia.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/Competing_Full_Report.pdf|publisher=EPIA|accessdate=August 2012}}</ref> Research carried out by [[UN-Energy]] in 2012 suggests areas of sunny countries with high electricity prices, such as Italy, Spain and Australia, and areas using diesel generators, have reached retail grid parity.<ref name=UN-Energy-2012/>\n\n== Mounting and tracking==\n{{main article|Photovoltaic mounting system|Solar tracker}}\n[[File:EarthRangersCentre-ImageEnhancement.jpg|thumb|Solar modules mounted on solar trackers]]\n[[File:Dual-glass solar panels.jpg|thumb|Double glass photovoltaic solar modules, installed in a support structure.]]\n\nGround mounted photovoltaic system are usually large, utility-scale [[solar power plants]].

This type of mounting system is well suited for sites where excavation is not possible such as capped landfills and simplifies decommissioning or relocation of solar module systems.\n\nRoof-mounted solar power systems consist of solar modules held in place by racks or frames attached to roof-based mounting supports.<ref name=eco>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecodiy.org/california%20PV/californian%20photovoltaic%20best.htm|title=A Guide To Photovoltaic System Design And Installation|publisher=ecodiy.org|accessdate=2011-07-26|work=}}</ref> Roof-based mounting supports include:\n* Pole mounts, which are attached directly to the roof structure and may use additional rails for attaching the module racking or frames.\n* Ballasted footing mounts, such as concrete or steel bases that use weight to secure the panel system in position and do not require through penetration. This mounting method allows for decommissioning or relocation of solar panel systems with no adverse effect on the roof structure.\n*All wiring connecting adjacent solar modules to the energy harvesting equipment must be installed according to local electrical codes and should be run in a conduit appropriate for the climate conditions\n\n[[Solar tracker]]s increase the amount of energy produced per module at a cost of mechanical complexity and need for maintenance.
