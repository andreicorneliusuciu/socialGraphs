Freeware (green) seldom expose their source codes.<ref name=\"wolfire2010\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.wolfire.com/2010/05/Open-source-software-is-not-always-freeware |title=Open-source software is not always freeware |date=May 16, 2010 |accessdate=2016-01-18 |first=David |last=Rosen |publisher=wolfire.com}}</ref>]]\nThe [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) defines \"open source software\" (i.e., free software or free and open source software), as distinct from \"freeware\" or \"shareware\"; it is software where \"the Government does not have access to the original source code\".<ref name=\"dod-definition\">{{citation | url=http://dodcio.defense.gov/OpenSourceSoftwareFAQ.aspx#Q:_Are_.22non-commercial_software.22.2C_.22freeware.22.2C_or_.22shareware.22_the_same_thing_as_open_source_software.3F | title=Frequently Asked Questions regarding Open Source Software (OSS) and the Department of Defense (DoD) | quote=Also, do not use the terms \"freeware\" or \"shareware\" as a synonym for \"open source software\". DoD Instruction 8500.2, \u201cInformation Assurance (IA) Implementation\u201d, Enclosure 4, control DCPD-1, states that these terms apply to software where \"the Government does not have access to the original source code\".  The government does have access to the original source code of open source software, so these terms do not apply. | accessdate=2012-06-11}}</ref> The \"free\" in \"freeware\" refers to the price of the software, which is typically [[proprietary software|proprietary]] and distributed without source code. By contrast, the \"free\" in \"free software\" refers to freedoms granted users under the software license (for example, to run the program for any purpose, modify and redistribute the program to others), and such software may be sold at a price.\n\nAccording to the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF), \"freeware\" is a loosely defined category and it has no clear accepted definition, although FSF asks that [[free software]] (libre; unrestricted and with source code available) should not be called freeware.<ref name=\"gnu\" />\nIn contrast the Oxford English Dictionary simply characterizes freeware as being \"available free of charge (sometimes with the suggestion that users should make a donation to the provider)\".<ref>{{OED|freeware}}</ref>\n\nSome freeware products are released alongside paid versions that either have more features or less restrictive licensing terms. This approach is known as [[freemium]] (\"free\" + \"premium\"), since the free version is intended as a promotion for the premium version.<ref name=\"freeisnot\"/> The two often share a code base, using a [[compiler flag]] to determine which is produced. For example, [[BBEdit]] has a [[BBEdit Lite]] edition which has less features. [[XnView]] is available free of charge for personal use but must be licensed for commercial use. The free version may be advertising supported, as was the case with the [[DivX]].\n\n{{Anchor|Registerware}}[[Ad-supported software]] and free registerware also bear resemblances to freeware. Ad-supported software do not ask money for license but display advertisement to either compensate for development costs or as a mean of income. Registerware forces the user to subscribe with the publisher before being able to use the product. While commercial products [[Product activation|may require registration to ensure licensed use]], free registerware do not.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=akoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA101&lpg=RA1-PA101&dq=registerware&source=bl&ots=P8ufFsLfVk&sig=zsK5DDTrgUSvTEdOSo9y6qhHFw4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAjgKahUKEwifvI6d7_DIAhXHthoKHXoFAFk#v=onepage&q=registerware&f=false|title = An exercise in frustration?

In May 2015 advertising freeware on [[Google AdWords]] was restricted to \"authoritative source\"[s].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/6023676#uc |title=Legal requirements |website=Advertising Policies Help |publisher=[[Google]] |access-date=6 November 2016}}</ref> Thus web sites and [[blog]]s are the primary resource for information on which freeware is available, useful, and is not [[malware]]. However, there are also many [[computer magazine]]s or newspapers that provide ratings for freeware and include compact discs or other [[storage media]] containing freeware. Freeware is also often [[bundled software|bundled]] with other products such as [[digital camera]]s or [[Image scanner|scanner]]s.\n\nFreeware has been criticized as \"unsustainable\" because it requires a single entity to be responsible for updating and enhancing the product, which is then given away without charge.<ref name=\"freeisnot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/saas/free-is-not-a-business-model/807 |title=Free is not a business model |first=Phil |last=Wainewright |date=July 6, 2009 |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] }}</ref> Other freeware projects are simply released as [[one-off]] programs with no promise or expectation of further development. These may include [[source code]], as does free software, so that users can make any required or desired changes themselves, but this code remains subject to the license of the compiled executable and does not constitute free software.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of freeware]]\n* [[List of freeware video games]]\n* [[List of commercial video games released as freeware]]\n* [[Freely redistributable software]]\n* [[Gratis versus Libre]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{dmoz|Computers/Software/Freeware}}\n*[[freesoft:]] directory published by the [[Free Software Foundation]]\n\n<!--======================== {{No more links}} ============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
