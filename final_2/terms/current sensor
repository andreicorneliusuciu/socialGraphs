The generated signal could be analog voltage or current or even digital output. It can be then utilized to display the measured current in an ammeter or can be stored for further analysis in a data acquisition system or can be utilized for control purpose.\n\nThe sensed current and the output signal can be:\n* [[Alternating current]] input,\n** analog output, which duplicates the wave shape of the sensed current.\n** bipolar output, which duplicates the wave shape of the sensed current.\n** unipolar output, which is proportional to the average or RMS value of the sensed current.\n* [[Direct current]] input,\n** unipolar, with a unipolar output, which duplicates the wave shape of the sensed current\n** digital output, which switches when the sensed current exceeds a certain threshold\n\n== Technologies ==\n* [[Hall effect]] [[Integrated circuit|IC]] sensor.\n* [[Transformer]] or [[current clamp]] meter, (suitable for AC current only).\n* [[Fluxgate Transformer Type]], (suitable for AC and/or DC current).\n* [[Resistor]], whose voltage is directly proportional to the current through it.\n* [[Fiber optic current sensor]], using an [[Interferometry|interferometer]] to measure the phase change in the light produced by a magnetic field.\n* [[Rogowski coil]], electrical device for measuring alternating current (AC) or high speed current pulses.\n \nHall Effect current sensor is a type of current sensor which is based on phenomenon of Hall Effect discovered by Edwin Hall in 1879.\n\nHall Effect current sensors can measure all types of current signals i.e. AC,DC or pulsating current.\n\nThese sensors are currently being used widely in almost all the industries because of their vast applications and the type of output they provide, which can be manipulated and can be used for various application.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Shunt_(electrical)#Current_measurement_techniques|Current shunt]]\n*[[List of sensors]]\n\n{{Sensors}}\n\n[[Category:Sensors]]\n[[Category:Electrical meters]]"}]}}}}
