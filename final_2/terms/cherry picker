Often a duplicate set of controls that are used to manipulate the position of the bucket will be available to the person in the bucket, allowing the operator to position himself. The lifting arms of some cherry pickers are capable of telescoping to adjust the reach of the device, usually with automatic safety controls to prevent tipping over.  Articulated boom lifts are more appropriate than stick booms when operating in tight spaces or when clearing nearby obstacles is necessary. Cherry pickers can either be electrically powered using batteries or powered with a diesel engine. There are advantages and disadvantages associated with both types of power.\n\n== Uses ==\nCherry pickers were originally designed{{when|date=July 2013}} for use in [[orchard]]s (though not just [[cherry]] orchards) where they are still used frequently.<ref>[http://www.safetyline.wa.gov.au/pagebin/mechhazd0013.htm \"Reaching new heights in construction and horticulture\"] (extract). ''Safetyline Magazine''.  [[Government of Western Australia]]. Volume No. 20 (November 1993).</ref> It lets the [[fruit picker]] pick fruit high in a tree with relative ease. Similar devices, also known as 'cherry pickers', are used to service [[telephone]], [[cable television]], and [[electrical]] equipment on [[utility pole]]s.  [[Christmas light]] displays and [[banner]]s can also be affixed with a cherry picker.\n\nSome [[Fire apparatus|fire trucks]] have a cherry picker, known as a snorkel,<ref>{{dead link|date=July 2013}} [http://www.pnwspaamfaa.com/Terminology4.htm fire \"Apparatus Terminology 4\"].</ref> instead of a ladder. Some [[window cleaner]]s also use them. Cherry pickers are also used in [[mining]], [[construction]], exterior [[painting]], and sometimes by [[arborist]]s to work safely in otherwise unclimbable trees.\n\nCherry pickers were also used for the [[Mayor of London]]'s \"Hatwalk\" in July 2012. Cherry pickers were used to put hats onto the heads of some of the city's most iconic statues, including the statue of [[Admiral Lord Nelson]] atop [[Nelson's Column]] in [[Central London]]'s [[Trafalgar Square]].<ref>Cairns, Alan (July 30, 2012).  [http://digitaljournal.com/article/329664 \"Hats Entertainment{{spaced ndash}} London Statues Get a Millinery Makeover\"].  [[Digital Journal]]. Retrieved July 23, 2013.</ref>\n\nCherry pickers are also used to rescue people from roller coasters if the cars are stuck.\n\nIn the film and television industry, cherry pickers are known as \"condors\" and are often used to suspend large lights above sets when not on a soundstage.\n\nSome artists use cherry pickers on stage for effects, most notably [[Michael Jackson]], [[Justin Bieber]] and [[Kanye West]]. Jackson would use one on his tours performing \"[[Beat It]]\" and \"[[Earth Song]]\" from above the crowd. Bieber used one on an acoustic set which featured Be Alright and Fall during his [[Believe Tour]]. West used one on his song \"[[Dark Fantasy (song)|Dark Fantasy]]\" which was usually the opening of his concerts. [[David Bowie]] claimed to be the first pop star who used a cherry picker on stage during his theatrical [[Diamond Dogs Tour]] which started on 14 June 1974.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qKP4oVraDA]</ref>\n\nCeramic boom lifts can be utilised for specialised work in confined spaces, however, they are not as common as [[scissor lift]]s.\n\n== Images ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Cherrypicker.jpg|A wheeled cherry picker\nFile:Multiple bucket trucks.JPG|Parked bucket trucks\nFile:FocusAccess.png|Servicing a radio telescope\nFile:Ukrzalinytsia maintenance cars in Kiev -2012 1.JPG|A rail car-based self-propelled cherrypicker, designed for railway maintenance.
