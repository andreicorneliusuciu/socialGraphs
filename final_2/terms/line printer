It is mostly associated with [[unit record equipment]] and the early days of digital computing, but the technology is still in use.  Print speeds of 600 lines-per-minute (approximately 10 pages per minute) were achieved in the 1950s, later increasing to as much as 1200 lpm. Line printers print a complete line at a time and have speeds in the range of 150 to 2500 lines per minute. The different types of line printers are drum printers and chain printers. Other non-impact technologies have also been used, as [[Thermal printing|thermal line printers]] were popular in the 1970s and 1980s, <ref>[http://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Personal/HP9830A.html HP9866 thermal line printer]</ref> and some inkjet and laser printers produce output a line or a page at a time.\n\n== Designs ==\nMany impact printers, such as the [[daisywheel printer]] and [[dot matrix printer]], used a print head that printed a character then moved on until an entire line was printed. Line printers were much faster, as each impact printed an entire line.\n\nThere have been five principal designs:\n\n* Drum printers\n* Chain (train) printers\n* Bar printers\n* Comb printers\n* Wheel printers\n\nBecause all of these printing methods were noisy, line printers of all designs were enclosed in [[Acoustic hood|sound-absorbing cases]] of varying sophistication.\n\n=== Drum printer ===\n<!-- Section header used in redirects -->\n[[Image:Drum-printer.jpg|right|thumb|Drum Printer]]\n[[Image:TypefaceDrumPrinter1966.jpg|right|thumb|Typical typeface of a drum printer with staggered characters (mainframe; about 1965)]]\n[[Image:Drukarka wierszowa beben.jpg|right|thumb|Fragment of line printer drum<br>showing \"'''%'''\" characters.]]\nIn a typical '''drum printer''' design, a fixed font character set is engraved onto the periphery of a number of print wheels, the number matching the number of columns (letters in a line) the printer could print.  The wheels, joined to form a large drum (cylinder), spin at high speed and paper and an inked ribbon is stepped (moved) past the print position.  As the desired character for each column passes the print position, a hammer strikes the paper from the rear and presses the paper against the ribbon and the drum, causing the desired character to be recorded on the continuous paper. Because the drum carrying the letterforms (characters) remains in constant motion, the strike-and-retreat action of the hammers had to be very fast. Typically, they were driven by [[voice coil]]s mounted on the moving part of the hammer.\n\nOften the character sequences are staggered around the drum, shifting with each column. This obviates the situation whereby '''all''' of the hammers fire simultaneously when printing a line that consists of the same character in all columns, such as a complete line of dashes (\"----\").\n\nLower-cost printers did not use a hammer for each column. Instead, a hammer was provided for every other column and the entire hammer bank was arranged to shift left and right, driven by another one  voice coil. For this style of printer, two complete revolutions of the character drum were required with one revolution being used to print all the \"odd\" columns and another revolution being used to print all of the \"even\" columns. But in this way, only half (plus one) the number of hammers, magnets, and the associated channels of drive electronics were required.\n\nAt least one low-cost printer, made by [[Control Data Corporation|CDC]], achieved the same end by moving the paper laterally while keeping the hammer bank at rest.\n\n[[Dataproducts]] was a typical vendor of drum printers, often selling similar models with both a full set of hammers (and delivering, for example 600 lines-per-minute of output) and a half set of hammers (delivering 300 LPM).\n\n=== {{anchor|Chain printer|Train printer}}Chain (train) printer ===\n\n'''Chain printers''' (also known as '''train printers''') placed the type on moving bars (a horizontally-moving chain). As with the drum printer, as the correct character passed by each column, a hammer was fired from behind the paper.  Compared to drum printers, chain printers had the advantage that the type chain could usually be changed by the operator.  A further advantage was that vertical registration of characters in a line was much improved over drum printers, which needed extremely precise hammer timing to achieve a reasonably straight line of print. By selecting chains that had a smaller character set (for example, just numbers and a few punctuation marks), the printer could print much faster than if the chain contained the entire upper- and lower-case alphabet, numbers, and all special symbols.  This was because, with many more instances of the numbers appearing in the chain, the time spent waiting for the correct character to \"pass by\" was greatly reduced. Common letters and symbols would appear more often on the chain, according to the [[frequency analysis]] of the likely input. It was also possible to play primitive tunes on these printers by timing the nonsense of the printout to the sequence on the chain, a rather primitive piano. IBM was probably the best-known chain printer manufacturer and the [[IBM 1403]] is probably the most famous example of a chain printer.<!-- These also can print a complete line by using a chain with 2 moveable pulley different characters were embossed on the chain. -->\n\n[[Image:Printer band.jpg|right|thumb|Fragment of printer band, sitting on test printout for the characters (top) and hammer flight times (bottom)]]\n\n==== Band printer ====\n<!-- Section header used in redirects -->\n'''Band printers''' are a variation of chain printers, where a thin steel band is used instead of a chain, with the characters embossed or etched onto the band. Again, a selection of different bands were generally available with a different mix of characters so a character set best matched to the characters commonly printed could be chosen. [[Dataproducts]] was a well known manufacturer of band printers, with their B300, B600, and B1000 range, the model number representing the lines per minute rate of the printer. (The B300 was effectively a B600 with only half the number of hammers\u2014one per two character positions. The hammer bank moved back and forth one character position, requiring two goes to print all characters on each line.)\n\n=== Bar printer ===\n<!-- Section header used in redirects -->\n'''Bar printers''' were similar to chain printers but were slower and less expensive. Rather than a chain moving continuously in one direction, the characters were on fingers mounted on a bar that moved left-to-right and then right-to-left in front of the paper.  An example was the IBM 1443.\n\nIn all three designs, timing of the hammers (the so-called \"flight time\") was critical, and was adjustable as part of the servicing of the printer.  For drum printers, incorrect timing of the hammer resulted in printed lines that wandered vertically, albeit with characters correctly aligned horizontally in their columns.  For train and bar printers, incorrect timing of the hammers resulted in characters shifting horizontally, albeit on vertically-level printed lines.\n\nMost drum, chain, and bar printers were capable of printing up to 132 columns, but a few designs could only print 80 columns and some other designs as many as 160 columns.\n\n=== Comb printer ===\n<!-- Section header used in redirects -->\n'''Comb printers''', also called [[line matrix printer]]s, printed a matrix of dots instead of individual characters in the same way as single-character dot matrix printers, but using a comb of hammers to print a portion of an entire row of pixels at one time (for example, every eighth pixel).  By shifting the comb back and forth slightly, the entire pixel row could be printed (continuing the example, in eight cycles).  The paper then advanced and the next pixel row was printed. Because far less print head motion was involved than in a conventional dot matrix printer, these printers were much faster, and competitive in speed with formed-character line printers without being restricted to a set of available characters, thus being able to print dot-matrix graphics and variable-sized characters.\n\n[[Printronix]] and [[TallyGenicom]] are well-known vendors of comb printers.\n\n==={{anchor|Wheel printer}}Wheel printers===\nIn 1949 IBM introduced the [[IBM 407]] Accounting Machine with a wheel print mechanism that could print 150 alphanumeric lines a minute. Each of the 120 print positions had its own type wheel which rotated under electromechanical control. Once all were in position, print hammers struck the wheels against a ribbon and the paper.  The 407 or its wheel line printer mechanism was attached to a variety of early IBM computers, including the [[IBM 650]], most members of the [[IBM 700/7000 series]] and the [[IBM 1130]], the last introduced in 1965.\n\n== Paper (forms) handling ==\n[[File:IBM 1403 Printer opened.jpg|thumb|An IBM 1403 printer opened up as it would be to change paper. Note form tractors on each side of the paper and carriage control tape in upper right. Print chain is covered by full width ribbon on open gate, lower right.]][[File:Green-zebra-paper.png|thumb|Green-zebra-paper]]\nAll line printers used [[Continuous stationery|continuous form paper]] provided in boxes of continuous [[fan-fold]] forms rather than cut-sheets. The paper was usually [[Perforation|perforated]] to tear into cut sheets if desired and was commonly printed with alternating white and light-green areas, allowing the reader to easily follow a line of text across the page. This was the iconic <span id=\"green bar paper\">\"'''green bar'''\"</span> or \"music-ruled\" form that dominated the early computer age. Pre-printed forms were also commonly used (for printing [[cheque]]s, [[invoice]]s, etc.). A common task for the system operator was to change from one paper form to another as one print job completed and another was to begin. Some line printers had covers that opened automatically when the printer required attention.\n\nStandard \"green bar\" page sizes included [[portrait format|portrait-format]] pages of 8\u00bd \u00d7 11 inches, usually printed at 80 columns by 66 lines (at 6 [[lines per inch]]) or 88 lines (at 8 LPI), and [[landscape format|landscape-format]] pages of 14 \u00d7 11 inches, usually printed at 132 columns by 66 or 88 lines. Also common were landscape-format pages of 14 \u00d7 8\u00bd inches, allowing for 132 columns by 66 lines (at 8 LPI) on a more compact page.\n\nThese continuous forms were advanced through the printer by means of ''tractors'' ([[sprocket]]s or sprocket belts). Depending on the sophistication of the printer, there might simply be two tractors at the top of the printer (pulling the paper) or tractors at the top and bottom (thereby maintaining paper tension within the printer). The horizontal position of the tractors was usually adjustable to accommodate different forms. The earliest printers by IBM used a hydraulic motor to move the forms. In later line printers, High-speed [[servomechanism]]s usually drove the tractors, allowing very rapid positioning of the paper, both for advancing line-by-line and slewing to the top of the next form. The faster line printers, of necessity,  also used \"stackers\" to re-fold and stack the fan-fold forms as they emerged from the printer.\n\nThe high-speed motion of the paper often developed large [[Electrostatics|electrostatic]] charges. Line printers frequently used a variety of discharge [[brush]]es and active ([[corona discharge]]-based) static eliminators to discharge these accumulated charges.\n\nMany printers supported [[ASA carriage control characters]]{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} which provided a limited degree of control over the paper, by specifying how far to advance the paper between printed lines. Various means of providing vertical tabulation were provided, ranging from a paper [[carriage control tape]] loop to fully electronic (software-controllable) tab simulation.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:IBM 403 Accounting Machine.jpg|thumb|A type bar line printer was incorporated in the [[IBM 402]] and 403 accounting machines.]]\n[[File:IBM 729 Tape Drives.nasa.jpg|thumb|An IBM 716 line printer, based on the [[IBM 407]] wheel mechanism, attached to an [[IBM 7090]] mainframe at NASA's [[Goddard Spaceflight Center]] during [[Project Mercury]].]] \nTabulators built by the U.S. Census Bureau for the 1910 census could  print their results.<ref>{{cite book |last=Durand |first= Hon.

These references served to distinguish formatted final output from normal interactive output from the system, which in many cases in line printer days was also printed on paper (as by a [[teleprinter#Teleprinters in computing|teletype]]) but not by a line printer.
