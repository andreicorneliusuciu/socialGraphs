It is the fumes of liquid fuels that are flammable instead of the fluid.\nMost liquid fuels in widespread use are derived from [[fossil fuels]]; however, there are several types, such as hydrogen fuel (for [[automotive]] uses), ethanol, and biodiesel, which are also categorized as a liquid fuel. Many liquid fuels play a primary role in transportation and the economy.\n\nLiquid fuels are contrasted with [[solid fuel]]s and [[gaseous fuel]]s.\n\n==General properties==\nSome common properties of liquid fuels are that they are easy to transport, and can be handled with relative ease. Also they are relatively easy to use for all engineering applications, and home use. (Fuels like Kerosene are rationed and available in government subsidized shops in India for home use.) Liquid fuels are also used most popularly in [[Internal combustion engines]].\n\nSome very technically important properties include: [[flash point]], [[fire point]], [[cloud point]], and [[pour point]].\n\n==Petroleums==\n{{main|Petroleum}}\n\nMost liquid fuels used currently are produced from '''petroleum'''. The most notable of these is [[gasoline]]. Scientists generally accept that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of dead plants and animals by exposure to heat and pressure in the Earth's crust.\n\n===Gasoline===\n{{main|Gasoline}}\n\n'''Gasoline''' is the most widely used liquid fuel. Gasoline, as it is known in United States and Canada, or '''petrol''' virtually everywhere else, is made of hydrocarbon [[molecules]] (compounds that contain hydrogen and carbon only) forming [[aliphatic compound]]s, or chains of carbons with hydrogen atoms attached. However, many [[aromatic compound]]s (carbon chains forming rings) such as [[benzene]] are found naturally in gasoline and cause the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to the fuel.\n\nProduction of gasoline is achieved by [[distillation]] of [[crude oil]]. The desirable liquid is separated from the crude oil in [[refineries]]. Crude oil is extracted from the ground in several processes, the most commonly seen may be [[Pumpjack |beam pump]]s. To create gasoline, [[petroleum]] must first be removed from crude oil.\n\nLiquid gasoline itself is not actually burned, but its fumes ignite, causing the remaining liquid to [[evaporate]] and then burn. Gasoline is extremely volatile and easily combusts, making any leakage potentially extremely dangerous. Gasoline sold in most countries carries a published [[octane rating]]. The octane number is an [[empirical]] measure of the resistance of gasoline to combusting prematurely, known as [[engine knocking|knocking]]. The higher the octane rating, the more resistant the fuel is to autoignition under high pressures, which allows for a higher [[compression ratio]]. Engines with a higher compression ratio, commonly used in race cars and high-performance regular-production automobiles, can produce more power; however, such engines require a higher octane fuel.  Increasing the octane rating has, in the past, been achieved by adding 'anti-knock' additives such as lead-tetra-ethyl.  Because of the environmental impact of lead additives, the octane rating is increased today by refining out the impurities that cause knocking.\n\n===Diesel===\n{{main|Diesel fuel}}\n\nConventional '''diesel''' is similar to gasoline in that it is a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons extracted from petroleum. Diesel may cost more or less than gasoline, but generally costs less to produce because the extraction processes used are simpler. Some countries (particularly Canada and India) also have lower tax rates on diesel fuels. \n\nAfter distillation, the diesel fraction is normally processed to reduce the amount of [[sulfur]] in the fuel. Sulphur causes corrosion in vehicles, [[acid rain]] and higher emissions of soot from the tail pipe (exhaust pipe). Historically, in Europe lower sulfur levels than in the United States were legally required. However, recent US legislation reduced the maximum sulphur content of diesel from 3,000 ppm to 500 ppm in 2007, and 15 ppm by 2010. Similar changes are also underway in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and several Asian countries. See also [[Ultra-low-sulfur diesel]].\n\nA [[diesel engine]] is a type of [[internal combustion engine]] which ignites fuel by injecting it into a combustion chamber previously compressed with air (which in turn raises the temperature) as opposed to using an outside ignition source, such as a spark plug.\n\n===Kerosene===\n{{main|Kerosene}}\nKerosene is used in [[kerosene lamp]]s and as a fuel for cooking, heating, and small engines. It displaced [[whale oil]] for lighting use.  [[Jet fuel]] for jet engines is made in several grades ([[Avtur]], [[Jet A]], [[Jet A-1]], [[Jet B]], [[JP-4]], [[JP-5]], [[JP-7]] or [[JP-8]]) that are kerosene-type mixtures. One form of the fuel known as RP-1 is burned with liquid oxygen as rocket fuel. These fuel grade kerosenes meet specifications for smoke points and freeze points.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, kerosene or \"TVO\" (Tractor Vaporising Oil) was used as a cheap fuel for tractors. The engine would start on gasoline, then switch over to kerosene once the engine warmed up. A \"heat valve\" on the manifold would route the exhaust gases around the intake pipe, heating the kerosene to the point where it can be ignited by an [[electric spark]].\n\nKerosene is sometimes used as an additive in diesel fuel to prevent gelling or waxing in cold temperatures. However, this is not advisable in some recent vehicle diesel engines, as doing so may interfere with the engine's emissions regulation equipment.\n\n==Natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas==\n===Compressed natural gas===\n{{main|Compressed natural gas}}\n[[Natural gas]], composed chiefly of [[methane]], can be compressed to a liquid and used as a substitute for other traditional liquid fuels. Its combustion is very clean compared to other [[hydrocarbon]] fuels, but the fuel's low boiling point requires the fuel to be kept at high pressures to keep it in the liquid state. Though it has a much lower flash point than fuels such as gasoline, it is in many ways safer due to its higher [[autoignition temperature]] and its low density, which causes it to dissipate when released in air.\n\n===Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)===\n{{main|Liquefied petroleum gas}}\n[[LP gas]] is a mixture of [[propane]] and [[butane]], both of which are easily compressible gases under standard atmospheric conditions. It offers many of the advantages of compressed natural gas (CNG), but is denser than air, does not burn as cleanly, and is much more easily compressed. Commonly used for cooking and space heating, LP gas and compressed propane are seeing increased use in motorized vehicles; propane is the third most commonly used motor fuel globally.\n\n==Non-petroleum fossil fuels==\n{{main|Synthetic fuel}}\nWhen petroleum is not easily available, chemical processes such as the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] can be used to produce liquid fuels from [[coal]] or [[natural gas]]. Synthetic fuels from coal were strategically important during World War II for the German military.  Today synthetic fuels produced from natural gas are manufactured, to take advantage of the higher value of liquid fuels in transportation.\n\n==Biodiesel==\n{{main|Biodiesel}}\n\nBiodiesel is similar to diesel, but has differences akin to those between petrol and ethanol. For instance, biodiesel has a higher [[Cetane number|cetane]] rating (45-60 compared to 45-50 for crude-oil-derived diesel) and it acts as a cleaning agent to get rid of dirt and deposits. It has been argued that it only becomes economically feasible above oil prices of $80 (\u00a340 or \u20ac60 as of late February, 2007) per barrel. This does however depend on locality, economic situation, government stance on biodiesel and a host of other factors- and it has been proven to be viable at much lower costs in some countries. Also, it yields about 10% less energy than ordinary diesel. Analogous to the use of higher compression ratios used for engines burning higher octane alcohols and petrol in spark-ignition engines, taking advantage of biodiesel's high cetane rating can potentially overcome the energy deficit compared to ordinary Number 2 diesel.\n\n==Alcohols==\n{{main|Alcohol fuel}}\n\nGenerally, the term alcohol refers to ethanol, the first [[organic chemical]] produced by humans,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=021205&referURL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.accessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fa%3d021205s001%26id%3d021205#021205s001 |title=AccessScience &#124; Encyclopedia Article &#124; Alcohol fuel |publisher=Accessscience.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-06}}</ref> but any alcohol can be burned as a fuel. [[Ethanol]] and [[methanol]] are the most common, being sufficiently inexpensive to be useful.\n\n===Methanol===\n{{main|Methanol fuel}}\n\n'''Methanol''' is the lightest and simplest [[alcohol]], produced from the [[natural gas]] component [[methane]]. Its application is limited primarily due to its toxicity (similar to gasoline), but also due to its high [[corrosivity]] and miscibility with water. Small amounts are used in some gasolines to increase the [[octane rating]]. Methanol-based fuels are used in some race cars and model airplanes.\n\nMethanol is also called ''methyl alcohol'' or ''wood alcohol'', the latter because it was formerly produced from the [[distillation]] of wood. It is also known by the name ''methyl hydrate''.\n\n===Ethanol===\n{{main|Ethanol fuel}}\n\n'''Ethanol''', also known as grain alcohol or ethyl alcohol, is commonly found in [[alcoholic beverage]]s. However, it may also be used as a fuel, most often in combination with gasoline. For the most part, it is used in a 9:1 ratio of gasoline to ethanol to reduce the negative environmental effects of gasoline.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThere is increasing interest in the use of a blend of 85% fuel ethanol blended with 15% gasoline. This fuel blend called E85, has a higher fuel octane than most premium gasolines. When used in a modern [[Flexible fuel vehicle]], it delivers more performance to the gasoline it replaces at the expense of higher fuel consumption due to ethanol's lesser specific energy content.<ref>[[E85]]</ref> \n\nEthanol for use in gasoline and industrial purposes may be considered a fossil fuel because it is often synthesized from the petroleum product [[ethylene]], which is cheaper than production from [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of [[cereal|grains]] or [[sugarcane]].\n\n===Butanol===\n{{main|Butanol}}\n{{see also|Clostridium acetobutylicum}}\n\n'''Butanol''' is an [[alcohol]] which can be used as a fuel in most gasoline internal combustion engines without engine modification. It is typically a product of the fermentation of [[biomass]] by the [[bacterium]] ''Clostridium acetobutylicum'' (also known as the Weizmann organism). This process was first delineated by [[Chaim Weizmann]] in 1916 for the production of [[acetone]] from [[starch]] for making [[cordite]], a smokeless gunpowder. \n\nThe advantages of butanol are its high octane rating (over 100) and high energy content, only about 10% lower than gasoline, and subsequently about 50% more energy-dense than ethanol, 100% more so than methanol. Butanol's only major disadvantages are its high flashpoint (35 \u00b0C or 95 \u00b0F), toxicity (note that toxicity levels exist but are not precisely confirmed), and the fact that the fermentation process for renewable butanol emits a foul odour. The Weizmann organism can only tolerate butanol levels up to 2% or so, compared to 14% for ethanol and yeast. Making butanol from oil produces no such odour, but the limited supply and environmental impact of oil usage defeats the purpose of alternative fuels. The cost of butanol is about $1.25\u2013$1.32 per kilogram ($0.57-$0.58 per pound or $4 approx. per US gallon). Butanol is much more expensive than ethanol (approx. $.40 per liter or 1.50 per gallon) and methanol.\n\nOn June 20, 2006, DuPont and BP announced that they were converting an existing ethanol plant to produce 9 million gallons (34 000 cubic meters) of butanol per year from sugar beets. DuPont stated a goal of being competitive with oil at $30\u2013$40 per barrel ($0.19-$0.25 per liter) without subsidies, so the price gap with ethanol is narrowing.\n\n==Hydrogen==\n{{main|Liquid hydrogen}}\n{{see also|Hydrogen economy}}\n{{Refimprove|section|date=March 2008}}\n\n[[Liquid hydrogen|Liquefied hydrogen]] is the [[liquid state]] of the element [[hydrogen]]. It is a common liquid [[rocket fuel]] for [[spacecraft propulsion|rocket]] applications and can be used as a fuel in an [[internal combustion engine]] or [[fuel cell]]. Various concept [[hydrogen vehicle]]s have been lower volumetric energy, the hydrogen volumes needed for combustion are large. Hydrogen was liquefied for the first time by [[James Dewar]] in 1898.\n\n==Ammonia==\n[[Ammonia#As_a_fuel|Ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>) has been used as a fuel before at times when gasoline is unavailable (e.g. for buses in Belgium during WWII).  It has a volumetric energy density of 17 Megajoules per liter (compared to 10 for hydrogen, 18 for methanol, 21 for dimethyl ether and 34 for gasoline).  It must be compressed or cooled to be a liquid fuel, although it does not require [[cryogenic]] cooling as hydrogen does to be liquefied.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nh3car.com/FAQ1.htm |title=Ammonia FAQs |deadurl=no |accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}<!--added above categories by script-assisted edit-->\n\n[[Category:Liquid fuels| ]]"}]}}}}
