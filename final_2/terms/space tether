These are conducting tethers that carry a current that can generate either [[thrust]] or [[aerodynamic drag|drag]] from a [[planetary magnetic field]], in much the same way as an [[electric motor]] does.\n'''[[Momentum exchange tether]]s'''\n:These can be either rotating tethers, or [[Skyhook (structure)|non-rotating tethers]], that capture an arriving spacecraft and then release it at a later time into a different orbit with a different velocity.  Momentum exchange tethers can be used for [[orbital maneuver]]ing, or as part of a planetary-surface-to-orbit / orbit-to-escape-velocity space transportation system.\n'''[[Tethered formation flying]]'''\n:This is typically a [[insulator (electrical)|non-conductive]] tether that accurately maintains a set distance between multiple space vehicles flying in formation.\n'''[[Electric Sail|Electric sail]]'''\n:A form of [[solar wind]] sail with electrically charged [[tether]]s that will be pushed by the momentum of solar wind [[ion]]s.\n\nMany uses for space tethers have been proposed, including deployment as [[space elevator]]s, as [[Skyhook (structure)|skyhooks]], and for doing propellant-free orbital transfers.\n\n== History ==\n\n[[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] once proposed a tower so tall that it reached into space, so that it would be held there by the rotation of the [[Earth]]. However, at the time, there was no realistic way to build it.\n\nTo try to solve the problems in ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' (July 31, 1960), another Russian, [[Yuri Artsutanov]], wrote in greater detail about the idea of a tensile cable to be deployed from a [[geosynchronous satellite]], downwards towards the ground, and upwards away, keeping the cable balanced. This is the [[space elevator]] idea, a type of synchronous tether that would rotate with the earth. However, given the materials technology of the time, this too was impractical on Earth.\n\nIn the 1970s, [[Jerome Pearson]] independently conceived the idea of a space elevator, sometimes referred to as a synchronous tether,<ref name=\"Pearson 2005\">{{cite web| url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/1032Pearson.pdf| last=Pearson| date=2005| title=Lunar Space Elevators for Cislunar Space Development: Phase I Final Technical Report| first=Jerome| author2=Eugene Levin| author3=John Oldson| author4=Harry Wykes| last-author-amp=yes| format=PDF}}</ref> and, in particular, analyzed a [[lunar elevator]] that can go through the [[Lagrange point|L1 and L2 points]], and this was found to be possible with materials then existing.\n\nIn 1977, [[Hans Moravec]]<ref>[http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/1976.skyhook/papers/scable.pox The Journal of the Astronautical Sciences, v25#4, pp. 307-322, Oct-Dec 1977]</ref> and later [[Robert L.

Momentum Exchange Tethers come in two types; rotating and non-rotating.  A rotating tether will create a controlled force on the end-masses of the system due to centrifugal acceleration.  While the tether system rotates, the objects on either end of the tether will experience continuous acceleration; the magnitude of the acceleration depends on the length of the tether and the rotation rate. Momentum exchange occurs when an end body is released during the rotation.  The transfer of momentum to the released object will cause the rotating tether to lose energy, and thus lose velocity and altitude.  However, using [[electrodynamic tether]] thrusting, or [[ion propulsion]] the system can then re-boost itself with little or no expenditure of consumable reaction mass.\n\n===Skyhook===\n{{main article|Skyhook (structure)}}\n[[File:Skyhooks.gif|thumb|right|A rotating and a tidally stabilised skyhook in orbit]]\nA skyhook is a theoretical class of orbiting [[tether propulsion]] intended to lift payloads to high altitudes and speeds.<ref>H.

The choice of the metal [[electrical conductor|conductor]] to be used in an electrodynamic tether is determined by a variety of factors. Primary factors usually include high [[electrical conductivity]] and low [[density]]. Secondary factors, depending on the application, include cost, strength, and melting point.\n\nAn electrodynamic tether was profiled in the documentary film ''[[Orphans of Apollo]]'' as technology that was to be used to keep the Russian space station ''[[Mir]]'' in orbit.<ref name=\"Orphans of Apollo\" >{{cite web|title=Orphans of Apollo|url=http://orphansofapollo.wordpress.com/|publisher=World Press|accessdate=30 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=Foust>{{cite journal|last=Foust|first=Jeff|title=Preview: Orphans of Apollo|journal=The Space Review|date=July 23, 2001|url=http://thespacereview.com/article/1176/1|accessdate=30 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Formation flying===\n{{main article|Tethered formation flying}}\n\nThis is the use of a (typically) non-conductive tether to connect multiple spacecraft.\n\n==Technical difficulties==\n\n===Gravitational gradient stabilization===\n\n[[File:Fig11 Gravitational Gradient.PNG|thumb|right|Description of the forces contributing towards maintaining a gravity gradient alignment in a tether system]]\n\n{{main article|Gravity-gradient stabilization}}\n\nInstead of rotating end for end, tethers can also be kept straight by the slight difference in the strength of gravity over their length.\n\nA non-rotating tether system has a stable orientation that is aligned along the local vertical (of the earth or other body). This can be understood by inspection of the figure below where two spacecraft at two different altitudes have been connected by a tether. Normally, each spacecraft would have a balance of gravitational (e.g. F<sub>g1</sub>) and centrifugal (e.g. F<sub>c1</sub>), but when tied together by a tether, these values begin to change with respect to one another. This phenomenon occurs because, without the tether, the higher-altitude mass would travel slower than the lower mass. The system must move at a single speed, so the tether must therefore slow down the lower mass and speed up the upper one.  The centrifugal force of the tethered upper body is increased, while that of the lower-altitude body is reduced. This results in the centrifugal force of the upper body and the gravitational force of the lower body being dominant.  This difference in forces naturally aligns the system along the local vertical, as seen in the figure.<ref name=ref18>Cosmo, M. L., Lorenzini, E.

However, there are some common properties. To achieve maximum performance and low cost, tethers need to be made of materials with the combination of high strength or electrical conductivity and low density. All space tethers are susceptible to space debris or micrometeroids. Therefore, mission designers need to decide whether or not a protective coating is needed, including if against [[Ultraviolet|UV]] and [[atomic oxygen]]. Research is being conducted to assess the probability of a collision that would damage the tether [http://pdf.aiaa.org/getfile.cfm?urlX=4%3A7I%276D%26XY%22O%2CRA7KW4%5B%5DV%3A%5B%3D5%3A%28%20%0A&urla=%25%2ARH%23%23P8%20%0A&urlb=%21%2A%20%20%20%0A&urlc=%21%2A0%20%20%0A&urld=%28%2A%22%40%20%23%20%2AJUA%5C%20%0A&urle=%27%28%22X%20%22%20%22%40T0%20%20%0A MAST].\n\nFor applications that exert high tensile forces on the tether, the materials need to be strong and light. Some current tether designs use crystalline plastics such as [[ultra high molecular weight polyethylene]], [[aramid]] or carbon fiber. A possible future material would be [[carbon nanotube]]s, which have an estimated [[tensile strength]] between 140 and 177 [[Orders of magnitude (pressure)|GPa]] (20.3-25.6 million psi), and a proven tensile strength in the range 50-60 GPa for some individual nanotubes. (A [[monocrystalline whisker|number of other materials obtain 10 to 20 GPa]] in some samples on the nano scale, but translating such strengths to the macro scale has been challenging so far, with, as of 2011, CNT-based ropes being an order of magnitude less strong, not yet stronger than more conventional carbon fiber on that scale).<ref>[http://science-wired.blogspot.com/2010/04/nanotube-fibers.html Nanotube Fibers]</ref><ref>[http://apl.aip.org/resource/1/applab/v74/i21/p3152_s1?isAuthorized=no Tensile tests of ropes of very long aligned multiwall carbon nanotubes]</ref><ref>[https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mfyu/www/Documents/Publications/PRL1-2000.pdf Tensile Loading of Ropes of Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes and their Mechanical Properties]</ref>\n\nFor some applications, the tensile force on the tether is less than 15&nbsp;lbs (< 65 N)<ref name= \"TSS-1R Failure Investigation\">NASA, [http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19970011947 TSS-1R Mission Failure Investigation Board], Final Report, May 31, 1996 (accessed 7 April 2011)</ref> Material selection in this case depends on the purpose of the mission and design constraints. Electrodynamic tethers, such as the one used on TSS-1R, may use thin copper wires for high conductivity (see [[Electrodynamic tether|EDT]]).\n\nThere are design equations for certain applications that can identify typical quantities that drive material selection.\n\nSpace elevator equations typically use a \"characteristic length\", L<sub>c</sub>, which is also known as its \"self-support length\" and is the length of untapered cable it can support in a constant 1 ''g'' gravity field.\n:<math>L_c = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\rho g}</math>,\nwhere \u03c3 is the stress limit (in pressure units) and \u03c1 is the density of the material.\n\nHypersonic skyhook equations use the material's \"specific velocity\" which is equal to the maximum tangential velocity a spinning hoop can attain without breaking:\n:<math>V = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\rho}}</math>\n\nFor rotating tethers (rotovators) the value used is the material\u2019s \u2018characteristic velocity\u2019 which is the maximum tip velocity a rotating untapered cable can attain without breaking,\n:<math>V_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma}{\\rho}}</math>\nThe characteristic velocity equals the specific velocity multiplied by the square root of two.\n\nThese values are used in equations similar to the [[rocket equation]] and are analogous to specific impulse or exhaust velocity. The higher these values are, the more efficient and lighter the tether can be in relation to the payloads that they can carry. Eventually however, the mass of the tether propulsion system will be limited at the low end by other factors such as momentum storage.\n\n===Practical materials===\n{{disputed list|date=April 2014}}\nProposed materials include [[Kevlar]], [[ultra high molecular weight polyethylene]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} [[carbon nanotubes]] and [[M5 fiber]].

In practice this means that the central tether structure needs to be thicker than the tips. Correct tapering ensures that the tensile stress at every point in the cable is exactly the same. For very demanding applications, such as an Earth space elevator, the tapering can reduce the excessive ratios of cable weight to payload weight.\n\n====Thickness====\n\nFor rotating tethers not significantly affected by gravity, the thickness also varies, and it can be shown that the area, A, is given as a function of r (the distance from the centre) as follows:<ref name=lunarforward>[http://www.tethers.com/papers/LEO2Lunar%2792.pdf \"Tether Transport from LEO to the Lunar Surface\", R. L. Forward, AIAA Paper 91-2322, 27th Joint Propulsion Conference, 1991]</ref>\n:<math>A(r) = \\frac {M v^2} {T R} \\mathrm{e} ^ { \\frac {\\delta} {T} \\frac {v^2} {2} \\left( 1-\\frac {r^2} {R^2} \\right) } </math>\nwhere R is the radius of tether, v is the velocity with respect to the centre, M is the tip mass, <math>\\delta</math> is the material density, and T is the design tensile strength ([[Young's modulus]] divided by safety factor).\n\n====Mass ratio====\n\n[[File:Spinning tethers.png|thumb|right|Graph of tether mass to payload ratio versus the tip speed in multiples of the characteristic speed of the material]]\n\nIntegrating the area to give the volume and multiplying by the density and dividing by the payload mass gives a payload mass / tether mass ratio of:<ref name=lunarforward/>\n:<math>\\frac M m = \\sqrt { \\pi \\frac { \\delta } T \\frac {V^2} {2} } \\mathrm{e}^{ \\left( \\frac { \\delta } T \\frac {V^2} {2} \\right) } \\mathrm{erf} \\left( \\sqrt { \\frac { \\delta } T \\frac { V^2 } {2} } \\right)</math>\nwhere erf is the normal probability [[error function]].\n\nLet <math>V_r = V / V_c \\,</math>,\n:<math>V_c = \\sqrt { \\frac {2 T} \\delta }</math>\nthen:<ref>Non-Synchronous Orbital Skyhooks for the Moon and Mars with Conventional Materials - [[Hans Moravec]]</ref>\n:<math>\\frac M m = \\sqrt { \\pi } V_r \\mathrm{e}^{ {V_r}^2 } \\mathrm{erf} ( {V_r} ) </math>\nThis equation can be compared with the [[rocket equation]], which is proportional to a simple exponent on a velocity, rather than a velocity squared. This difference effectively limits the delta-v that can be obtained from a single tether.\n\n===Redundancy===\n\nIn addition the cable shape must be constructed to withstand micrometeorites and [[space debris|space junk]]. This can be achieved with the use of redundant cables, such as the [[Hoytether]]; redundancy can ensure that it is very unlikely that multiple redundant cables would be damaged near the same point on the cable, and hence a very large amount of total damage can occur over different parts of the cable before failure occurs.\n\n===Material strength===\n\nBeanstalks and rotovators are currently limited by the strengths of available materials.  Although ultra-high strength plastic fibers ([[Kevlar]] and [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene#Fiber applications|Spectra]]) permit rotovators to pluck masses from the surface of the Moon and Mars, a rotovator from these materials cannot lift from the surface of the Earth. In theory, high flying, [[supersonic]] (or [[hypersonic]]) aircraft could deliver a payload to a rotovator that dipped into Earth's upper atmosphere briefly at predictable locations throughout the tropic (and temperate) zone of Earth. As of May 2013, all mechanical tethers (orbital and elevators) are on hold until stronger materials are available.<ref name='on hold'>Jillian Scharr, \"Space Elevators On Hold At Least Until Stronger Materials Are Available, Experts Say\", Huffington Post, May 29, 2013 [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/space-elevators-stronger-materials_n_3353697.html]</ref>\n\n===Cargo capture===\n\nCargo capture for rotovators is nontrivial, and failure to capture can cause problems. Several systems have been proposed, such as shooting nets at the cargo, but all add weight, complexity, and another failure mode. At least one lab scale demonstration of a working grapple system has been achieved however.<ref>http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/news/releases/2005/05-108.html NASA Engineers, Tennessee College Students Successfully Demonstrate Catch Mechanism for Future Space Tether</ref>\n\n===Life expectancy===\n\nCurrently, the strongest materials in tension are plastics that require a coating for protection from UV radiation and (depending on the orbit) erosion by atomic oxygen. Disposal of [[waste heat]] is difficult in a [[vacuum]], so [[thermal shock|overheating]] may cause tether failures or damage.\n\n==Control and Modelling==\n\n===Pendular motion instability===\n\nElectrodynamic tethers deployed along the local vertical ('hanging tethers') may suffer from dynamical instability. Pendular motion causes the tether vibration amplitude to build up under the action of electromagnetic interaction. As the mission time increases, this behavior can compromise the performance of the system. Over a few weeks, electrodynamic tethers in Earth orbit might build up vibrations in many modes, as their orbit interacts with irregularities in magnetic and gravitational fields.\n\nOne plan to control the vibrations is to actively vary the tether current to counteract the growth of the vibrations. Electrodynamic tethers can be stabilized by reducing their current when it would feed the oscillations, and increasing it when it opposes oscillations.  Simulations have demonstrated that this can control tether vibration.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} This approach requires sensors to measure tether vibrations, which can either be an [[inertial navigation system]] on one end of the tether, or [[satellite navigation]] systems mounted on the tether, transmitting their positions to a receiver on the end.\n\nAnother proposed method is to use spinning electrodynamic tethers instead of hanging tethers. The gyroscopic effect provides passive stabilisation, avoiding the instability.\n\n===Surges===\nAs mentioned earlier, conductive tethers have failed from unexpected current surges. Unexpected [[electrostatic discharge]]s have cut tethers (e.g. see Tethered Satellite System Reflight (TSS\u20111R) on [[STS-75|STS\u201175]]), damaged electronics, and welded tether handling machinery. It may be that the Earth's magnetic field is not as homogeneous as some engineers have believed.\n\n===Vibrations===\n\nComputer models frequently show tethers can snap due to vibration.\n\nMechanical tether-handling equipment is often surprisingly heavy, with complex controls to damp vibrations.  The one ton climber proposed by Dr. Brad Edwards for his Space Elevator may detect and suppress most vibrations by changing speed and direction. The climber can also repair or augment a tether by spinning more strands.\n\nThe vibration modes that may be a problem include skipping rope, transverse, longitudinal, and pendulum.<ref>[http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/tether/dynamics.html Tether dynamics]</ref>\n\nTethers are nearly always tapered, and this can greatly amplify the movement at the thinnest tip in whip-like ways.\n\n===Other issues===\n\nA tether is not a spherical object, and has significant extent. This means that as an extended object, it is not directly modelable as a point source, and this means that the [[center of mass]] and [[center of gravity]] are not usually colocated. Thus the inverse square law does not apply except at large distances, to the overall behaviour of a tether. Hence the orbits are not completely Keplerian, and in some cases they are actually chaotic.<ref>http://www.academia.edu/3453325/Ultra_Long_Orbital_Tethers_Behave_Highly_Non-Keplerian_and_Unstable Ultra Long Orbital WSEAS TRANSACTIONS on MATHEMATICS: Tethers Behave Highly Non-Keplerian and Unstable- Daniele Mortari</ref>\n\nWith [[Non-rocket spacelaunch#Bolo|bolus]] designs, rotation of the cable interacting with the non linear gravity fields found in elliptical orbits can cause exchange of orbital angular momentum and rotation angular momentum. This can make prediction and modelling extremely complex.\n\n==In fiction==\n\nThe mechanics of tether propulsion are critical in resolving the climax of the book ''[[The Descent of Anansi]]'' by [[Steven Barnes]] and [[Larry Niven]] and rotating tethers play a role in ''[[seveneves]]'' by [[Neal Stephenson]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight|Science|Science fiction}}\n*[[STARS-II]]\n* [[Spacecraft propulsion]]\n* [[Non-rocket spacelaunch]]\n* [[Orbital ring]] \u2014 artificial ring place in Earth orbit\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n\n===Text===\n* [http://data.engin.umich.edu/Icarus/proseds_ed.html ProSEDS, a tether-based propulsion experiment]\n* [http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~spgroup/ Special Projects Group]\n* [http://www1.msfc.nasa.gov/NEWSROOM/background/facts/momentum.pdf NASA tether overview]\n* [http://www.tethers.com/ Tethers Unlimited Incorporated]\n* [http://www.tethers.com/papers/TethersInSpace.pdf \"Tethers In Space Handbook\" M.
