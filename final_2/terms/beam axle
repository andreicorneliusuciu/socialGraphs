Beam axles were once commonly used at the rear wheels of a vehicle, but historically they have also been used as front axles in rear-wheel-drive vehicles. In most automobiles, beam axles have been replaced by front and rear [[independent suspension]]s. \n\n==Implementation==\n[[Image:Solid Axle Diagram.svg|center|thumb|400px|Solid axle [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] characteristics: Camber change on bumps, none on rebound, large unsprung weight]]\nWith a beam axle the [[camber angle]] between the wheels is the same no matter where it is in the travel of the suspension. \n\nA beam axle's fore and aft location is constrained by either: [[trailing arm]]s,  semi-trailing arms, [[radius rod]]s, or [[leaf spring]]s. The lateral location is constrained by either: a [[Panhard rod]], a [[Scott Russell linkage]] or a [[Watt's linkage]]. While [[shock absorbers]] and either leaf springs, [[coil spring]]s, or [[air suspension|air bags]] are used to control vertical movement.\n\nThe [[Twist-beam rear suspension]] is a similar suspension design, however its beam axle is able to twist thereby functioning as an [[sway bar|anti-roll bar]] to control the roll motion of the body and is considered to be an semi-independent suspension design.\n\n==Live axle vs dead axle==\n[[Image:Live axle front suspension.jpg|thumb|right|A live axle in a Jeep. This is the front suspension, using coil springs.]]\nA '''live axle''' is a type of beam axle in which the shaft (or shafts, since live axles, while connected to move as a single unit, are seldom one piece) also transmits power to the wheels; a beam axle that does not also transmit power is sometimes called a '''dead axle'''. While typically used in vehicles with [[Hotchkiss drive]], this suspension system can also be used with other types of power transmission.\n\n==Advantages==\nThe principal advantage of the beam axle is its simplicity. This simplicity makes it very space-efficient and relatively cheap to manufacture. They are nearly universally used in buses and [[Truck#Heavy trucks|heavy-duty trucks]]. Most light and medium duty [[pickup truck]]s, [[SUV]]s, and [[van]]s also use a beam axle, at least in the rear. Beam axles have an important advantage for [[Off-road vehicle|off-road]] applications, as they provide better vehicle [[ramp travel index|articulation]] and durability in a high load environment. This simplicity also makes it relatively easy to [[Suspension lift|lift]] a vehicle. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Disadvantages==\nThe drawbacks are that it does not allow each wheel to move independently in response to bumps, and the mass of the beam is part of the [[unsprung weight]] of the vehicle, which can further reduce [[ride quality]]. Also the cornering ability is typically worse than other suspension designs because the wheels have zero [[camber angle]] gain during body roll.  Front beam axle suspension is also unusually sensitive to any lack of concentricity in the hub and wheel assembly which can cause a side-to-side oscillation (\"shimmy\") of the steering at certain speeds (typically 40-50mph).  This is addressed on some vehicles with steering dampers although removal and careful refitting of the front wheels often cures the problem.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Axle]]\n* [[Twist-beam rear suspension]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Automotive handling}}\n{{Powertrain}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beam Axle}}\n[[Category:Automotive suspension technologies]]"}]}}}}
