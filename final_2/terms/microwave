(1993). ''Microwave Engineering'' Addison\u2013Wesley Publishing Company.

In all cases, microwave includes the entire [[Super high frequency|SHF]] band (3 to 30&nbsp;GHz, or 10 to 1&nbsp;cm) at minimum, with [[RF engineering]] often restricting the range between 1 and 100&nbsp;GHz (300 and 3&nbsp;mm).\n\nThe [[prefix]] ''{{linktext|micro-}}'' in ''microwave'' is not meant to suggest a wavelength in the micrometer range. It indicates that microwaves are \"small\", compared to waves used in typical [[radio broadcasting]], in that they have shorter wavelengths. The boundaries between [[far infrared]], [[terahertz radiation]], microwaves, and [[ultra-high-frequency]] [[radio]] [[wave]]s are fairly arbitrary and are used variously between different fields of study.\n\nThere is broad [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] from water vapor from several hundred MHz, increasing in frequency to 40&nbsp;GHz. Beginning at about 40&nbsp;GHz, even dry atmosphere becomes less transparent to microwaves, at higher frequencies due to absorption from oxygen. A spectral band structure at even higher frequencies causes absorption peaks at specific frequencies (see graph at right). Above 100&nbsp;GHz, the absorption of electromagnetic radiation by Earth's atmosphere is so great that it is in effect [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], until the atmosphere becomes transparent again in the so-called [[infrared]] and [[optical window]] frequency ranges.\n\nThe term ''microwave'' also has a more technical meaning in [[electromagnetics]] and [[circuit theory]].  Apparatus and techniques may be described qualitatively as \"microwave\" when the frequencies used are high enough that wavelengths of signals are roughly the same as the dimensions of the equipment, so that [[Lumped element model|lumped-element circuit theory]] is inaccurate. As a consequence, practical microwave technique tends to move away from the discrete [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, and [[inductor]]s used with lower-frequency [[radio waves]]. Instead, [[Distributed element model|distributed circuit element]]s and transmission-line theory are more useful methods for design and analysis. Open-wire and coaxial [[transmission line]]s used at lower frequencies are replaced by [[waveguide]]s and [[stripline]], and lumped-element tuned circuits are replaced by cavity [[resonator]]s or resonant lines.  In turn, at even higher frequencies, where the wavelength of the electromagnetic waves becomes small in comparison to the size of the structures used to process them, microwave techniques become inadequate, and the methods of [[optics]] are used.\n\n== Electromagnetic spectrum ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable nowrap\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!colspan=\"5\"| [[Electromagnetic spectrum]]\n|-\n!

These devices operate on different principles from low-frequency vacuum tubes, using the ballistic motion of electrons in a vacuum under the influence of controlling electric or magnetic fields, and include the [[magnetron]] (used in [[microwave oven]]s), [[klystron]], [[traveling-wave tube]] (TWT), and [[gyrotron]]. These devices work in the [[density]] modulated mode, rather than the [[Electric current|current]] modulated mode.  This means that they work on the basis of clumps of electrons flying ballistically through them, rather than using a continuous stream of electrons.\n\nLow-power microwave sources use solid-state devices such as the [[field-effect transistor]] (at least at lower frequencies), [[tunnel diode]]s, [[Gunn diode]]s, and [[IMPATT diode]]s.<ref>[http://www.herley.com/index.cfm?act=app_notes&notes=oscillators Microwave Oscillator] notes by [[Herley Industries|Herley General Microwave]]</ref> Low-power sources are available as benchtop instruments, rackmount instruments, embeddable modules and in card-level formats.  A [[maser]] is a solid state device which amplifies microwaves using similar principles to the [[laser]], which amplifies higher frequency light waves.\n\nAll warm objects emit low level microwave [[black-body radiation]], depending on their [[temperature]], so in meteorology and [[remote sensing]] [[microwave radiometer]]s are used to measure the temperature of objects or terrain.<ref name=\"Sisodia\">{{cite book |last=Sisodia |first=M.

Microwaves are especially suitable for this use since they are more easily focused into narrower beams than radio waves, allowing [[frequency reuse]]; their comparatively higher frequencies allow broad [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and high [[data transmission rate]]s, and antenna sizes are smaller than at lower frequencies because antenna size is inversely proportional to transmitted frequency. Microwaves are used in spacecraft communication, and much of the world's  data, TV, and telephone communications are transmitted long distances by microwaves between ground stations and [[communications satellite]]s. Microwaves are also employed in [[microwave oven]]s and in [[radar]] technology.\n\n=== Communication ===\n\n{{main article|Point-to-point (telecommunications)|Microwave transmission|Satellite communications}}\n\nBefore the advent of [[fiber-optic]] transmission, most [[long-distance call|long-distance]] [[telephone call]]s were carried via networks of [[microwave radio relay]] links run by carriers such as [[AT&T Long Lines]].  Starting in the early 1950s, [[frequency division multiplex]] was used to send up to 5,400 telephone channels on each microwave radio channel, with as many as ten radio channels combined into one antenna for the ''hop'' to the next site, up to 70&nbsp;km away.\n\n[[Wireless LAN]] [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]]s, such as [[Bluetooth]] and the [[IEEE Standards Association|IEEE]] [[802.11]] specifications used for Wi-Fi, also use microwaves in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz [[ISM band]], although [[802.11a]] uses [[ISM band]] and [[U-NII]] frequencies in the 5&nbsp;GHz range.  Licensed long-range (up to about 25&nbsp;km) Wireless Internet Access services have been used for almost a decade in many countries in the 3.5&ndash;4.0&nbsp;GHz range.  The FCC recently{{when |date=August 2011}} carved out spectrum for carriers that wish to offer services in this range in the U.S. \u2014 with emphasis on 3.65&nbsp;GHz.  Dozens of service providers across the country are securing or have already received licenses from the FCC to operate in this band. The WIMAX service offerings that can be carried on the 3.65&nbsp;GHz band will give business customers another option for connectivity.\n\n[[Metropolitan area network]] (MAN) protocols, such as [[WiMAX]] (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) are based on standards such as [[IEEE 802.16]], designed to operate between 2 and 11&nbsp;GHz. Commercial implementations are in the 2.3&nbsp;GHz, 2.5&nbsp;GHz, 3.5&nbsp;GHz and 5.8&nbsp;GHz ranges.\n\n[[Mobile Broadband]] Wireless Access (MBWA) protocols based on standards specifications such as [[IEEE 802.20]] or ATIS/ANSI [[HC-SDMA]] (such as [[iBurst]]) operate between 1.6 and 2.3&nbsp;GHz to give mobility and in-building penetration characteristics similar to mobile phones but with vastly greater spectral efficiency.<ref>{{cite web |title= IEEE  802.20: Mobile Broadband Wireless Access (MBWA) |work= Official web site |url= http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/20/ |accessdate= August 20, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nSome [[mobile phone]] networks, like [[Global System for Mobile Communications#Radio interface|GSM]], use the low-microwave/high-UHF frequencies around 1.8 and 1.9&nbsp;GHz in the Americas and elsewhere, respectively.  [[DVB-SH]] and [[S-DMB]] use 1.452 to 1.492&nbsp;GHz, while proprietary/incompatible [[satellite radio]] in the U.S. uses around 2.3&nbsp;GHz for [[Digital Audio Radio Service|DARS]].\n\nMicrowave radio is used in [[broadcasting]] and [[telecommunication]] transmissions because, due to their short wavelength, highly [[directional antenna]]s are smaller and therefore more practical than they would be at longer wavelengths (lower frequencies).  There is also more [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] in the microwave spectrum than in the rest of the radio spectrum; the usable bandwidth below 300&nbsp;MHz is less than 300&nbsp;MHz while many GHz can be used above 300&nbsp;MHz. Typically, microwaves are used in [[television news]] to transmit a signal from a remote location to a television station from a specially equipped van.  See [[broadcast auxiliary service]] (BAS), [[remote pickup unit]] (RPU), and [[studio/transmitter link]] (STL).\n\nMost [[satellite communications]] systems operate in the C, X, K<sub>a</sub>, or K<sub>u</sub> bands of the microwave spectrum. These frequencies allow large bandwidth while avoiding the crowded UHF frequencies and staying below the atmospheric absorption of EHF frequencies.  [[Satellite TV]] either operates in the C band for the traditional [[TVRO|large dish]] [[fixed satellite service]] or K<sub>u</sub> band for [[direct-broadcast satellite]].  Military communications run primarily over X or K<sub>u</sub>-band links, with K<sub>a</sub> band being used for [[Milstar]].\n\n=== Navigation ===\n\n{{further information|Satellite navigation|Navigation|}}\n\n[[Global Navigation Satellite System]]s (GNSS) including the Chinese [[Beidou navigation system|Beidou]], the American [[Global Positioning System]]((introduced in 1978)GPS) and the Russian [[GLONASS]] broadcast navigational signals in various bands between about 1.2&nbsp;GHz and 1.6&nbsp;GHz.\n\n=== Radar ===\n\n[[File:Diplexer1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|An [[air traffic control]] radar using pipes as [[waveguide]]s]]\n\n{{main article|Radar}}\n\n[[Radar]] uses microwave radiation to detect the range, speed, and other characteristics of remote objects. Development of radar was accelerated during World War II due to its great military utility. Now radar is widely used for applications such as [[air traffic control]], weather forecasting, navigation of ships, and [[speed limit enforcement]].\n\nMicrowaves cannot be carried with usable efficiency in ordinary [[transmission line]]s but require [[waveguide]], such as a metal pipe.\n\nA [[Gunn diode]] oscillator and waveguide are used as a motion detector for [[Swing door operator|automatic door openers]].\n\n{{multiple image\n |direction = vertical\n |align = left\n |width = 220\n |image1=ALMA seen from a hexacopter.jpg\n |image2=BigBangNoise.jpg\n |caption1=The [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] telescope\n |caption2=Improving [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|CMBR]]-maps\n}}\n\n=== Radio astronomy ===\n\n{{main article|radio astronomy}}\n\nMost [[radio astronomy]] uses microwaves. Usually the naturally-occurring microwave radiation is observed, but active radar experiments have also been done with objects in the solar system, such as determining the distance to the [[Moon]] or mapping the invisible surface of [[Venus]] through cloud cover.\n\nThe [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]], located at more than 5,000 meters (16,597&nbsp;ft) altitude in Chile, observes the [[universe]] in the [[Terahertz radiation|millimetre and submillimetre]] wavelength ranges. The world's largest ground-based astronomy project to date consists of more than 66 dishes and was built in an international collaboration by Europe, North America, East Asia and Chile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.almaobservatory.org/en | title = ALMA website | accessdate = 2011-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/alma/ | title = Welcome to ALMA! | accessdate = 2011-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThe [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMBR) has been mapped by a number of instrument at an ever-increasing resolution. The CMBR is understood to be a \"relic radiation\" from the [[Big Bang]]. Due to the expansion and thus cooling of the Universe, the originally high-energy radiation has been shifted into the microwave region of the radio spectrum. Sufficiently sensitive [[radio telescope]]s can detected the CMBR as a faint background glow, almost exactly the same in all directions, that is not associated with any star, galaxy, or other object.<ref>\n{{cite book|last=Wright|first=E.L.|date=2004|chapter=Theoretical Overview of Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropy|editor=W.

Microwave ovens became common kitchen appliances in Western countries in the late 1970s, following the development of less expensive [[cavity magnetron]]s. Water in the liquid state possesses many molecular interactions that broaden the absorption peak. In the vapor phase, isolated water molecules absorb at around 22&nbsp;GHz, almost ten times the frequency of the microwave oven.\n\nMicrowave heating is used in industrial processes for drying and [[curing (chemistry)|curing]] products.\n\nMany [[Fabrication (semiconductor)|semiconductor processing]] techniques use microwaves to generate [[plasma physics|plasma]] for such purposes as [[reactive ion etching]] and plasma-enhanced [[chemical vapor deposition]] (PECVD).\n\nMicrowave frequencies typically ranging from 110 \u2013 140&nbsp;GHz are used in [[stellarator]]s and [[Tokamak#Radio-frequency heating|tokamak]] experimental fusion reactors to help heat the fuel into a plasma state. The upcoming [[ITER]] thermonuclear reactor<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iter.org/default.aspx |title=The way to new energy |publisher=ITER |date=2011-11-04 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}</ref> is expected to range from 110\u2013170&nbsp;GHz and will employ electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipp.mpg.de/ippcms/eng/for/bereiche/technologie/projekte/ecrh.html |title=Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH) |publisher=Ipp.mpg.de |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}</ref>\n\nMicrowaves can be used to [[microwave power transmission|transmit power]] over long distances, and post-[[World War II]] research was done to examine possibilities.  [[NASA]] worked in the 1970s and early 1980s to research the possibilities of using [[solar power satellite]] (SPS) systems with large [[Photovoltaic module|solar array]]s that would beam power down to the Earth's surface via microwaves.\n\n[[Less-than-lethal]] weaponry exists that uses millimeter waves to heat a thin layer of human skin to an intolerable temperature so as to make the targeted person move away.

Less-than-Lethal Directed Energy Protection]. raytheon.com</ref>\n\n=== Spectroscopy ===\n\nMicrowave radiation is used in [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] (EPR or ESR) spectroscopy, typically in the X-band region (~9&nbsp;GHz) in conjunction typically with [[magnetic field]]s of 0.3 T. This technique provides information on unpaired [[electron]]s in chemical systems, such as [[free radical]]s or [[transition metal]] ions such as Cu(II). Microwave radiation is also used to perform [[rotational spectroscopy]] and can be combined with [[electrochemistry]] as in [[microwave enhanced electrochemistry]].\n\n== Microwave frequency bands ==\n[[File:Atmospheric electromagnetic opacity.svg|thumb|500px|Rough plot of Earth's atmospheric transmittance (or opacity)&nbsp;to&nbsp;various [[wavelength]]s of electromagnetic radiation.

Here the unknown frequency is compared with harmonics of a known lower frequency by use of a low frequency generator, a harmonic generator and a mixer. Accuracy of the measurement is limited by the accuracy and stability of the reference source.\n\nMechanical methods require a tunable resonator such as an [[absorption wavemeter]], which has a known relation between a physical dimension and frequency.\n\nIn a laboratory setting, [[Lecher lines]] can be used to directly measure the wavelength on a transmission line made of parallel wires, the frequency can then be calculated. A similar technique is to use a slotted [[waveguide]] or slotted coaxial line to directly measure the wavelength. These devices consist of a probe introduced into the line through a longitudinal slot, so that the probe is free to travel up and down the line. Slotted lines are primarily intended for measurement of the [[voltage standing wave ratio]] on the line. However, provided a [[standing wave]] is present, they may also be used to measure the distance between the [[node (physics)|nodes]], which is equal to half the wavelength. Precision of this method is limited by the determination of the nodal locations.\n\n== Effects on health {{anchor|Health effects}} ==\n{{further information|Electromagnetic radiation and health|Microwave burn}}\n\nMicrowaves do not contain sufficient energy to chemically change substances by ionization, and so are an example of [[non-ionizing]] radiation.<ref name=\"HyperPhysics Radiation Interaction\">{{cite web |last1=Nave |first1=Rod |title=Interaction of Radiation with Matter |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/mod3.html |website=HyperPhysics |accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref> The word \"radiation\" refers to energy radiating from a source and not to [[radioactivity]].

In 1955 Dr. James Lovelock was able to reanimate rats frozen at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C using microwave diathermy.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=541\u2013546 |journal=The Journal of Physiology |date=1955 |first1=R.K. |last1=Andjus |first2=J.E. |last2=Lovelock |volume=128 |issue=3 |title=Reanimation of rats from body temperatures between 0 and 1 \u00b0C by microwave diathermy |pmc=1365902 |pmid=13243347 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1955.sp005323}}</ref>\n\nWhen injury from exposure to microwaves occurs, it usually results from dielectric heating induced in the body.  Exposure to microwave radiation can produce [[cataract]]s by this mechanism,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/radiation-emittingproducts/resourcesforyouradiationemittingproducts/ucm252762.htm#Microwave_Ovens_and_Health |title=Resources for You (Radiation-Emitting Products) |date= |accessdate=20 October 2014 |website=US Food and Drug Administration home page |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |last= |first=}}</ref> because the microwave heating [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]]s [[protein]]s in the [[Lens (anatomy)|crystalline lens]] of the [[Human eye|eye]] (in the same way that heat turns [[egg white]]s white and opaque). The lens and [[cornea]] of the eye are especially vulnerable because they contain no [[blood vessel]]s that can carry away heat. Exposure to heavy doses of microwave radiation (as from an oven that has been tampered with to allow operation even with the door open) can produce heat damage in other tissues as well, up to and including serious [[burn]]s that may not be immediately evident because of the tendency for microwaves to heat deeper tissues with higher moisture content.\n\n[[Eleanor R. Adair]] conducted microwave health research by exposing herself, animals and humans to microwave levels that made them feel warm or even start to sweat and feel quite uncomfortable. She found no adverse health effects other than heat.\n\n== History and research ==\n[[File:EM spectrum.svg|thumb|200px|right|Electromagnetic spectrum (visible-light range highlighted).]]\n\nThe existence of radio waves was predicted by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1864 from [[Maxwell's equations|his equations]].  In 1888, [[Heinrich Hertz]] was the first to demonstrate the existence of radio waves by building a [[spark gap transmitter|spark gap radio transmitter]] that produced 450&nbsp;MHz microwaves, in the UHF region.  The equipment he used was primitive, including a horse trough, a wrought iron point spark, and [[Leyden jar]]s.  He also built the first [[parabolic antenna]], using a zinc gutter sheet.   In 1894, Indian radio pioneer [[Jagdish Chandra Bose]] publicly demonstrated radio control of a bell using millimeter wavelengths, and conducted research into the propagation of microwaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tuc.nrao.edu/~demerson/bose/bose.html |title=The work of Jagdish Chandra Bose: 100 years of MM-wave research |publisher=National Radio Astronomy Observatory |date=February 1998 |author=Emerson, D.T.}}</ref>\n\nPerhaps the first, documented, formal use of the term ''microwave'' occurred in 1931:\n:\"When trials with wavelengths as low as 18 cm were made known, there was undisguised surprise that the problem of the micro-wave had been solved so soon.\"  ''Telegraph & Telephone Journal'' XVII. 179/1\n\nIn 1943, the Hungarian engineer [[Zolt\u00e1n Bay]] sent ultra-short radio waves to the moon, which, reflected from there, worked as a radar, and could be used to measure distance, as well as to study the moon.\n\nPerhaps the first use of the word ''microwave'' in an astronomical context occurred in 1946 in an article \"Microwave Radiation from the Sun and Moon\" by [[Robert Dicke]] and [[Robert Beringer]]. This same article also made a showing in the ''[[New York Times]]'' issued in 1951. [[Ernst Weber (engineer)|Ernst Weber]] pioneered microwave technologies.\n\nIn the [[history of electromagnetic theory]], significant work specifically in the area of microwaves and their applications was carried out by researchers including:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Specific work on microwaves\n!
