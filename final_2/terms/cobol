However, it is verbose and uses over 300 [[reserved word]]s. In contrast with modern, succinct syntax like {{code|1=y = x;|lang=c}}, COBOL has a more English-like syntax (in this case, {{code|MOVE x TO y|lang=cobolfree}}).\nCOBOL code is split into four divisions (identification, environment, data and procedure) containing a rigid hierarchy of sections, paragraphs and sentences. Lacking a large [[standard library]], the standard specifies 43 statements, 87 functions and just one class.\n\nAcademic computer scientists were generally uninterested in business applications when COBOL was created and were not involved in its design; it was (effectively) designed from the ground up as a computer language for businessmen, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs, whose only data types were numbers and strings of text.<ref>http://cs.brown.edu/~adf/programming_languages.html</ref>\nCOBOL has been criticized throughout its life, however, for its verbosity, design process and poor support for [[structured programming]], which resulted in monolithic and incomprehensible programs.\n\n==History and specification==\n\n===Background===\nIn the late 1950s, computer users and manufacturers were becoming concerned about the rising cost of programming. A 1959 survey had found that in any data processing installation, the programming cost US$800,000 on average and that translating programs to run on new hardware would cost $600,000. At a time when new [[Timeline of programming languages|programming languages were proliferating]] at an ever increasing rate, the same survey suggested that if a common business-oriented language were used, conversion would be far cheaper and faster.{{sfn|Beyer|2009|p=282}}\n\n[[File:Grace Hopper.jpg|thumb|alt=caption|[[Grace Hopper]], the inventor of [[FLOW-MATIC]], a predecessor to COBOL]]\n\nIn April 1959, [[Mary K.

The delegation impressed Charles A. Phillips, director of the Data System Research Staff at the DoD, who thought that they \"thoroughly understood\" the DoD's problems. The DoD operated 225 computers, had a further 175 on order and had spent over $200 million on implementing programs to run on them. Portable programs would save time, reduce costs and ease modernization.{{sfn|Beyer|2009|p=283}}\n\nPhillips agreed to sponsor the meeting and tasked the delegation with drafting the agenda.{{sfn|Beyer|2009|p=284}}\n\n===COBOL 60===\nOn May 28 and 29 of 1959 (exactly one year after the Z\u00fcrich [[ALGOL 58]] meeting), a meeting was held at the Pentagon to discuss the creation of a common programming language for business. It was attended by 41 people and was chaired by Phillips.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1109/MAHC.1985.10047| title = Early Meetings of the Conference on Data Systems Languages| journal = IEEE Annals of the History of Computing| volume = 7| issue = 4| pages = 316| year = 1985 | subscription=yes}}</ref> The Department of Defense was concerned about whether it could run the same data processing programs on different computers. [[FORTRAN]], the only mainstream language at the time, lacked the features needed to write such programs.{{sfn|Sammet|2004|p=104}}\n\nRepresentatives enthusiastically described a language that could work in a wide variety of environments, from banking and insurance to utilities and inventory control. They agreed unanimously that more people should be able to program and that the new language should not be restricted by the limitations of contemporary technology. A majority agreed that the language should make maximal use of English, be capable of change, be machine-independent and be easy to use, even at the expense of power.{{sfn|Beyer|2009|p=286}}\n\nThe meeting resulted in the creation of a [[steering committee]] and short-, intermediate- and long-range committees. The short-range committee was given to September (three months) to produce specifications for an interim language, which would then be improved upon by the other committees.{{sfn|Conner|1984|p=ID/9}}{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|p=201}} Their official mission, however, was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of existing programming languages and did not explicitly direct them to create a new language.{{sfn|Sammet|2004|p=104}}\nThe deadline was met with disbelief by the short-range committee.{{sfn|Bemer|1971|p=132}}\nOne member, [[Betty Holberton]], described the three-month deadline as \"gross optimism\" and doubted that the language really would be a stopgap.{{sfn|Beyer|2009|p=288}}\n\nThe steering committee met on June 4 and agreed to name the entire activity as the ''Committee on Data Systems Languages'', or [[CODASYL]], and to form an executive committee.{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|p=203}}\n\nThe short-range committee was made up of members representing six computer manufacturers and three government agencies. The six computer manufacturers were [[Burroughs Corporation]], [[IBM]], [[Honeywell|Minneapolis-Honeywell]] (Honeywell Labs), [[RCA]], [[Sperry Rand]], and [[Sylvania Electric Products]]. The three government agencies were the [[US Air Force]], the Navy's [[David Taylor Model Basin]], and the [[National Bureau of Standards]] (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology).{{sfn|CODASYL|1969|loc=\u00a7 I.2.1.1}} The committee was chaired by [[Joseph Wegstein]] of the US National Bureau of Standards. Work began by investigating data description, statements, existing applications and user experiences.{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|p=204}}\n\nThe committee mainly examined the [[FLOW-MATIC]], [[AIMACO]] and [[COMTRAN]] programming languages.{{sfn|Sammet|2004|p=104}}{{sfn|CODASYL|1969|loc=\u00a7 I.1.2}}\nThe FLOW-MATIC language was particularly influential because it had been implemented and because AIMACO was a derivative of it with only minor changes.{{sfn|Beyer|2009|p=290}}<ref name=cisn>{{cite journal | last = Sammet | first = Jean | authorlink = Jean Sammet | title = The Early History of COBOL | journal = ACM SIGPLAN Notices | volume = 13 | issue = 8 | pages = 121\u2013161 | publisher = Association for Computing Machinery, Inc. | year = 1978 | url =http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1198367 | doi =10.1145/960118.808378 | accessdate = 14 January 2010 | subscription=yes}}</ref>\nFLOW-MATIC's inventor, Grace Hopper, also served as a technical adviser to the committee.{{sfn|Bemer|1971|p=132}} FLOW-MATIC's major contributions to COBOL were long variable names, English words for commands and the separation of data descriptions and instructions.{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|p=217}}\n\nIBM's COMTRAN language, invented by [[Bob Bemer]], was regarded as a competitor to FLOW-MATIC{{sfn|Beyer|2009|p=292}}{{sfn|Bemer|1971|p=131}} by a short-range committee made up of colleagues of Grace Hopper.{{sfn|Beyer|2009|p=296}}\nSome of its features were not incorporated into COBOL so that it would not look like IBM had dominated the design process,{{sfn|Conner|1984|p=ID/9}} and Jean Sammet said in 1981 that there had been a \"strong anti-IBM bias\" from some committee members (herself included).{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|p=221}}\nIn one case, after Roy Goldfinger, author of the COMTRAN manual and intermediate-range committee member, attended a subcommittee meeting to support his language and encourage the use of algebraic expressions, Grace Hopper sent a memo to the short-range committee reiterating Sperry Rand's efforts to create a language based on English.{{sfn|Beyer|2009|p=291}}\nIn 1980, Grace Hopper commented that \"COBOL 60 is 95% FLOW-MATIC\" and that COMTRAN had had an \"extremely small\" influence.

While some members thought the language had too many compromises and was the result of [[design by committee]], others felt it was better than the three languages examined. Some felt the language was too complex; others, too simple.{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|pp=205\u2013206}}\nControversial features included those some considered useless or too advanced for data processing users. Such features included [[boolean expression]]s, [[formula]]s and table ''{{dfn|subscripts}}'' (indices).{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|loc=Figure 8}}{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|pp=230\u2013231}} Another point of controversy was whether to make keywords context-sensitive and the effect that would have on readability.{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|loc=Figure 8}} Although context-sensitive keywords were rejected, the approach was later used in [[PL/I]] and partially in COBOL from 2002.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2001|p=846}} Little consideration was given to [[interactivity]], interaction with [[operating system]]s (few existed at that time) and functions (thought of as purely mathematical and of no use in data processing).{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|p=220}}{{sfn|Sammet|1978a|p=228}}\n\nThe specifications were presented to the Executive Committee on September 4. They fell short of expectations: Joseph Wegstein noted that \"it contains rough spots and requires some additions\", and Bob Bemer later described them as a \"hodgepodge\". The subcommittee was given until December to improve it.{{sfn|Bemer|1971|p=132}}\n\nAt a mid-September meeting, the committee discussed the new language's name.

Instead, some businesses have migrated their systems from expensive mainframes to cheaper, more modern systems, while maintaining their COBOL programs.<ref name=\"Computerworld Not Dead Yet\" />\n\n==Features==\n\n===Syntax===\nCOBOL has an English-like syntax, which is used to describe nearly everything in a program. For example, a condition can be expressed as &nbsp;{{code|x IS GREATER THAN y|lang=cobolfree}} or more concisely as &nbsp;{{code|x GREATER y|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; or &nbsp;{{code|x > y|lang=cobolfree}}. More complex conditions can be \"abbreviated\" by removing repeated conditions and variables. For example, &nbsp;{{code|1=a > b AND a > c OR a = d|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; can be shortened to {{code|1=a > b AND c OR = d|lang=cobolfree}}. As a consequence of this English-like syntax, COBOL has over 300 [[keyword (computer programming)|keywords]].{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 8.9}}{{efn|Vendor-specific extensions cause many implementations to have far more: one implementation recognizes over 1,100 keywords.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://documentation.microfocus.com/help/topic/com.microfocus.eclipse.infocenter.visualcobol.vs2013/HRLHLHARES01U005.html | title=Reserved Words Table | publisher=[[Micro Focus]] | work=Micro Focus Visual COBOL 2.2 COBOL Language Reference | accessdate=3 March 2014}}</ref>}} Some of the keywords are simple alternative or pluralized spellings of the same word, which provides for more English-like statements and clauses; e.g., the {{code|IN}} and {{code|OF}} keywords can be used interchangeably, as can {{code|IS}} and {{code|ARE}}, and {{code|VALUE}} and {{code|VALUES}}.\n\nEach COBOL program is made up of four basic [[lexical items]]: words, literals, picture character-strings (see {{slink||PICTURE clause}}) and separators. Words include reserved words and user-defined identifiers. They are up to 31 characters long and may include letters, digits, hyphens and underscores. Literals include numerals (e.g. {{code|12}}) and strings (e.g. {{code|'Hello!'}}).{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 8.3.1.2}} Separators include the space character and commas and semi-colons followed by a space.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 8.3.2}}\n\nA COBOL program is split into four divisions: the identification division, the environment division, the data division and the procedure division. The identification division specifies the name and type of the source element and is where classes and interfaces are specified. The environment division specifies any program features that depend on the system running it, such as [[computer files|files]] and [[character sets]]. The data division is used to declare [[variable (computer science)|variable]]s and [[parameter (computer programming)|parameter]]s. The procedure division contains the program's [[statement (computer science)|statement]]s. Each division is sub-divided into sections, which are made up of paragraphs.\n\n===Code format===\nCOBOL can be written in two formats: fixed (the default) or free. In fixed-format, code must be aligned to fit in certain areas. Until COBOL 2002, these were:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name\n! Column(s)\n! Usage\n|-\n| Sequence number area\n| 1\u20136\n| Originally used for card/line numbers, this area is ignored by the compiler\n|-\n| Indicator area\n| 7\n| The following characters are allowed here:\n* <code>*</code> \u2013 Comment line\n* <code>/</code> \u2013 Comment line that will be printed on a new page of a source listing\n* <code>-</code> \u2013 Continuation line, where words or literals from the previous line are continued\n* <code>D</code> \u2013 Line enabled in debugging mode, which is otherwise ignored\n|-\n| Area A\n| 8\u201311\n| This contains: <code>DIVISION</code>, <code>SECTION</code> and procedure headers; 01 and 77 level numbers and file/report descriptors\n|-\n| Area B\n| 12\u201372\n| Any other code not allowed in Area A\n|-\n| Program name area\n| 73\u2013\n| Historically up to column 80 for punched cards, it is used to identify the program or sequence the card belongs to\n|}\n\nIn COBOL 2002, Areas A and B were merged to form the program-text area, which now ends at an implementor-defined column.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2001|loc=\u00a7 F.2}}\n\nCOBOL 2002 also introduced free-format code. Free-format code can be placed in any column of the file, as in newer programming languages. Comments are specified using <code>*></code>, which can be placed anywhere and can also be used in fixed-format source code. Continuation lines are not present, and the <code>>>PAGE</code> directive replaces the <code>/</code> indicator.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2001|loc=\u00a7 F.2}}\n\n===Identification division===\nThe identification division identifies the following code entity and contains the definition of a class or interface.\n\n====Object-oriented programming====\n[[class (computer programming)|Classes]] and [[Interface (object-oriented programming)|interfaces]] have been in COBOL since 2002. Classes have factory objects, containing class [[method (computer programming)|methods]] and variables, and instance objects, containing instance methods and variables.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 D.18.2}} Inheritance and interfaces provide [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]. Support for [[generic programming]] is provided through parameterized classes, which can be instantiated to use any class or interface. Objects are stored as references which may be restricted to a certain type. There are two ways of calling a method: the {{code|INVOKE}} statement, which acts similarly to {{code|CALL}}, or through inline method invocation, which is analogous to using functions.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 D.18}}\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\n*> These are equivalent.\nINVOKE my-class \"foo\" RETURNING var\nMOVE my-class::\"foo\" TO var *> Inline method invocation\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nCOBOL does not provide a way to [[Member visibility|hide]] methods. Class data can be hidden, however, by declaring it without a [[property (programming)|{{code|PROPERTY}}]] clause, which leaves the user with no way to access it.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|p=108}} [[Method overloading]] was added in COBOL 2014.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|p=896}}\n\n===Environment division===\nThe environment division contains the configuration section and the input-output section. The configuration section is used to specify variable features such\nas currency signs, locales and character sets. The input-output section contains file-related information.\n\n====Files====\nCOBOL supports three file formats, or ''{{dfn|organizations}}'': sequential, indexed and relative. In sequential files, records are contiguous and must be traversed [[sequential access|sequentially]], similarly to a [[linked list]]. Indexed files have one or more indexes which allow records to be [[random access|randomly accessed]] and which can be sorted on them. Each record must have a [[unique key]], but other, ''{{dfn|alternate}}'', record keys need not be unique. Implementations of indexed files vary between vendors, although common implementations, such as [[C-ISAM|C&#8209;ISAM]] and [[VSAM]], are based on IBM's [[ISAM]]. Relative files, like indexed files, have a unique record key, but they do not have alternate keys. A relative record's key is its ordinal position; for example, the 10th record has a key of 10. This means that creating a record with a key of 5 may require the creation of (empty) preceding records. Relative files also allow for both sequential and random access.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 D.2.1}}\n\nA common non-standard extension is the ''{{dfn|line sequential}}'' organization, used to process text files. Records in a file are terminated by a [[newline]] and may be of varying length.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://supportline.microfocus.com/documentation/books/nx30books/fhorgs.htm | title=File Organizations | publisher=Micro Focus | work=File Handling | date=1998 | accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Data division===\nThe data division is split into six sections which declare different items: the file section, for file records; the working-storage section, for [[static variable]]s; the local-storage section, for [[automatic variable]]s; the linkage section, for parameters and the return value; the report section and the screen section, for [[text-based user interface]]s.\n\n====Aggregated data====\nData items in COBOL are declared hierarchically through the use of level-numbers which indicate if a data item is part of another. An item with a higher level-number is subordinate to an item with a lower one. Top-level data items, with a level-number of 1, are called ''{{dfn|records}}''. Items that have subordinate aggregate data are called ''{{dfn|group items}}''; those that do not are called ''{{dfn|elementary items}}''. Level-numbers used to describe standard data items are between 1 and 49.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 8.5.1.2}}{{sfn|Cutler|2014|loc=Appendix A}}\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       01  some-record.                   *> Aggregate group record item\n           05  num            PIC 9(10).  *> Elementary item\n           05  the-date.                  *> Aggregate (sub)group record item\n               10  the-year   PIC 9(4).   *> Elementary item\n               10  the-month  PIC 99.     *> Elementary item\n               10  the-day    PIC 99.     *> Elementary item\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the above example, elementary item {{code|num}} and group item {{code|the-date}} are subordinate to the record {{code|some-record}}, while elementary items {{code|the-year}}, {{code|the-month}}, and {{code|the-day}} are part of the group item {{code|the-date}}.\n\nSubordinate items can be disambiguated with the {{code|IN}} (or {{code|OF}}) keyword. For example, consider the example code above along with the following example:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       01  sale-date.\n           05  the-year       PIC 9(4).\n           05  the-month      PIC 99.\n           05  the-day        PIC 99.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe names {{code|the-year}}, {{code|the-month}}, and {{code|the-day}} are ambiguous by themselves, since more than one data item is defined with those names. To specify a particular data item, for instance one of the items contained within the {{code|sale-date}} group, the programmer would use {{code|the-year IN sale-date}} (or the equivalent {{code|the-year OF sale-date}}). (This syntax is similar to the \"dot notation\" supported by most contemporary languages.)\n\n====Other data levels====\nA level-number of 66 is used to declare a re-grouping of previously defined items, irrespective of how those items are structured. This data level, also referred to by the associated {{dfn|{{code|RENAMES}} clause}}, is rarely used<ref>{{cite book | title=Sams Teach Yourself COBOL in 24 hours | publisher=[[Sams|SAMS Publishing]] | year=1999 | pages=40 | isbn=978-0672314537 | first=Thane | last=Hubbell | lccn=98087215}}</ref> and, circa 1988, was usually found in old programs. Its ability to ignore the hierarchical and logical structure data meant its use was not recommended and many installations forbade its use.{{sfn|McCracken|Golden|1988|loc=\u00a7 19.9}}\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       01  customer-record.\n           05  cust-key            PIC X(10).\n           05  cust-name.\n               10  cust-first-name PIC X(30).\n               10  cust-last-name  PIC X(30).\n           05  cust-dob            PIC 9(8).\n           05  cust-balance        PIC 9(7)V99.\n           \n       66  cust-personal-details   RENAMES cust-name THRU cust-dob.\n       66  cust-all-details        RENAMES cust-name THRU cust-balance.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nA 77 level-number indicates the item is stand-alone, and in such situations is equivalent to the level-number 01. For example, the following code declares two 77-level data items, {{code|property-name}} and {{code|sales-region}}, which are non-group data items that are independent of (not subordinate to) any other data items:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       77  property-name      PIC X(80).\n       77  sales-region       PIC 9(5).\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAn 88 level-number declares a ''{{dfn|condition name}}'' (a so-called 88-level) which is true when its parent data item contains one of the values specified in it {{code|VALUE}} clause.{{sfn|Cutler|2014|loc=\u00a7 5.8.5}} For example, the following code defines two 88-level condition-name items that are true or false depending on the current character data value of the {{code|wage-type}} data item. When the data item contains a value of {{code|'H'}}, the condition-name {{code|wage-is-hourly}} is true, whereas when it contains a value of {{code|'S'}} or {{code|'Y'}}, the condition-name {{code|wage-is-yearly}} is true. If the data item contains some other value, both of the condition-names are false.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       01  wage-type          PIC X.\n           88  wage-is-hourly VALUE \"H\".\n           88  wage-is-yearly VALUE \"S\", \"Y\".\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n====Data types====\nStandard COBOL provides the following data types:{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 8.5.2}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Numeric data is converted between different representations and sizes silently and alphanumeric data can be placed in any data item that can be stored as a string, including numeric and group data.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.9.24}} In contrast, object references and pointers may only be assigned from items of the same type and their values may be restricted to a certain type.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.9.35}}\n\n=====PICTURE clause=====\nA {{code|PICTURE}} (or {{code|PIC}}) clause is a string of characters, each of which represents a portion of the data item and what it may contain. Some picture characters specify the type of the item and how many characters or digits it occupies in memory. For example, a {{code|9}} indicates a decimal digit, and an {{code|S}} indicates that the item is [[signedness|signed]]. Other picture characters (called ''{{dfn|insertion}}'' and ''{{dfn|editing}}'' characters) specify how an item should be formatted. For example, a series of {{code|+}} characters define character positions as well as how a leading sign character is to be positioned within the final character data; the rightmost non-numeric character will contain the item's sign, while other character positions corresponding to a {{code|+}} to the left of this position will contain a space. Repeated characters can be specified more concisely by specifying a number in parentheses after a picture character; for example, {{code|9(7)}} is equivalent to {{code|9999999}}. Picture specifications containing only digit ({{code|9}}) and sign ({{code|S}}) characters define purely ''{{dfn|numeric}}'' data items, while picture specifications containing alphabetic ({{code|A}}) or alphanumeric ({{code|X}}) characters define ''{{dfn|alphanumeric}}'' data items. The presence of other formatting characters define ''{{dfn|edited numeric}}'' or ''{{dfn|edited alphanumeric}}'' data items.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 13.18.40}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples\n|-\n! {{code|PICTURE}} clause\n!

Depending on the data type, it can either complement or be used instead of a {{code|PICTURE}} clause. While it can be used to declare pointers and object references, it is mostly geared towards specifying numeric types. These numeric formats are:{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 13.18.60.3}}\n\n* Binary, where a minimum size is either specified by the <code>PICTURE</code> clause or by a <code>USAGE</code> clause such as <code>BINARY-LONG</code>.\n* {{code|USAGE COMPUTATIONAL|lang=cobolfree}}, where data may be stored in whatever format the implementation provides; often equivalent to &nbsp;{{code|USAGE BINARY|lang=cobolfree}}\n* {{code|USAGE DISPLAY|lang=cobolfree}}, the default format, where data is stored as a string\n* Floating-point, in either an implementation-dependent format or according to IEEE 754.\n* {{code|USAGE NATIONAL|lang=cobolfree}}, where data is stored as a string using an extended character set\n* {{code|USAGE PACKED-DECIMAL|lang=cobolfree}}, where data is stored in the smallest possible decimal format (typically [[packed binary-coded decimal]])\n\n====Report writer====\nThe report writer is a [[declarative programming|declarative]] facility for creating reports. The programmer need only specify the report layout and the data required to produce it, freeing them from having to write code to handle things like page breaks, data formatting, and headings and footings.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|p=855}}\n\nReports are associated with report files, which are files which may only be written to through report writer statements.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       FD  report-out REPORT sales-report.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nEach report is defined in the report section of the data division. A report is split into report groups which define the report's headings, footings and details. Reports work around hierarchical ''{{dfn|control breaks}}''. Control breaks occur when a key variable changes it value; for example, when creating a report detailing customers' orders, a control break could occur when the program reaches a different customer's orders. Here is an example report description for a report which gives a salesperson's sales and which warns of any invalid records:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n       RD  sales-report\n           PAGE LIMITS 60 LINES\n           FIRST DETAIL 3\n           CONTROLS seller-name.\n\n       01  TYPE PAGE HEADING.\n           03  COL 1                    VALUE \"Sales Report\".\n           03  COL 74                   VALUE \"Page\".\n           03  COL 79                   PIC Z9 SOURCE PAGE-COUNTER.\n\n       01  sales-on-day TYPE DETAIL, LINE + 1.\n           03  COL 3                    VALUE \"Sales on\".\n           03  COL 12                   PIC 99/99/9999 SOURCE sales-date.\n           03  COL 21                   VALUE \"were\".\n           03  COL 26                   PIC $$$$9.99 SOURCE sales-amount.\n\n       01  invalid-sales TYPE DETAIL, LINE + 1.\n           03  COL 3                    VALUE \"INVALID RECORD:\".\n           03  COL 19                   PIC X(34) SOURCE sales-record.\n\n       01  TYPE CONTROL HEADING seller-name, LINE + 2.\n           03  COL 1                    VALUE \"Seller:\".\n           03  COL 9                    PIC X(30) SOURCE seller-name.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe above report description describes the following layout:\n<pre>\nSales Report                                                             Page  1\n\nSeller: Howard Bromberg\n  Sales on 10/12/2008 were $1000.00\n  Sales on 12/12/2008 were    $0.00\n  Sales on 13/12/2008 were   $31.47\n  INVALID RECORD: Howard Bromberg             XXXXYY\n\nSeller: Howard Discount\n...\nSales Report                                                            Page 12\n\n  Sales on 08/05/2014 were  $543.98\n  INVALID RECORD: William Selden      12O52014FOOFOO\n  Sales on 30/05/2014 were    $0.00\n</pre>\n\nFour statements control the report writer: {{code|INITIATE}}, which prepares the report writer for printing; {{code|GENERATE}}, which prints a report group; {{code|SUPPRESS}}, which suppresses the printing of a report group; and {{code|TERMINATE}}, which terminates report processing. For the above sales report example, the procedure division might look like this:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobol\">\n           OPEN INPUT sales, OUTPUT report-out\n           INITIATE sales-report\n \n           PERFORM UNTIL 1 <> 1\n               READ sales\n                   AT END\n                       EXIT PERFORM\n               END-READ\n \n               VALIDATE sales-record\n               IF valid-record\n                   GENERATE sales-on-day\n               ELSE\n                   GENERATE invalid-sales\n               END-IF\n           END-PERFORM\n \n           TERMINATE sales-report\n           CLOSE sales, report-out\n           .\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Procedure division===\n\n====Procedures====\nThe sections and paragraphs in the procedure division (collectively called procedures) can be used as [[label (programming)|labels]] and as simple [[subroutines]]. Unlike in other divisions, paragraphs do not need to be in sections.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.4}}\nExecution goes down through the procedures of a program until it is terminated.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.6.3}}\nTo use procedures as subroutines, the {{code|PERFORM}} verb is used. This transfers control to the specified range of procedures and returns only upon reaching the end.\n\n[[File:COBOL Mine.svg|thumb|left|upright|alt=PROCEDURE DIVISION. PERFORM update-screen. GOBACK. fix-screen SECTION. MOVE \"Error fixed\" TO screen-line. PERFORM update-screen. update-screen SECTION. IF invalid-screen, GO TO fix-screen. END-IF.|A mine is \"armed\" when the screen is invalid.]]\n\nUnusual control flow can trigger ''{{dfn|mines}}'', which cause control in performed procedures to return at unexpected times to unexpected locations. Procedures can be reached in three ways: they can be called with {{code|PERFORM}}, jumped to from a {{code|GO TO}} or through execution \"falling through\" the bottom of an above paragraph. Combinations of these invoke [[undefined behavior]], creating mines. Specifically, mines occur when execution of a range of procedures would cause control flow to go past the last statement of a range of procedures already being performed.<ref name=\"FR99\">{{cite conference | url=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ramali/Papers/paste99.pdf | title=Identifying Procedural Structure in Cobol Programs | doi=10.1145/381788.316163 | first1=John | last1=Field | first2=G. | last2=Ramalingam | format=PDF | conference=PASTE '99 | ISBN=1581131372 | conferenceurl=http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/paste99.html | date=September 1999}}</ref><ref name=\"VV07\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~nveerman/research/minefield/minefield.pdf | title=Cobol minefield detection | journal=Software\u2014Practice and Experience |date=November 2006 | volume=36 | issue=14 | doi=10.1002/spe.v36:14 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306135410/http://www.cs.vu.nl/~nveerman/research/minefield/minefield.pdf | deadurl=yes | archivedate=6 March 2007 | publisher=Wiley | last1=Veerman | first1=Niels | last2=Verhoeven | first2=Ernst-Jan | format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nFor example, in the code in the adjacent image, a mine is tripped at the end of {{code|update-screen}} when the screen is invalid. When the screen is invalid, control jumps to the {{code|fix-screen}} section, which, when done, performs {{code|update-screen}}. This recursion triggers undefined behavior as there are now two overlapping ranges of procedures being performed. The mine is then triggered upon reaching the end of {{code|update-screen}} and means control could return to one of two locations:\n\n* The first {{code|PERFORM}} statement\n* The {{code|PERFORM}} statement in {{code|fix-screen}}, where it would then \"fall-through\" into {{code|update-screen}} and return to the first {{code|PERFORM}} statement upon reaching the end.\n\n====Statements====\nCOBOL 2014 has 47 statements (also called ''{{dfn|verbs}}''),{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.9}} which can be grouped into the following broad categories: control flow, I/O, data manipulation and the report writer. The report writer statements are covered in the [[#Report writer|report writer section]].\n\n=====Control flow=====\nCOBOL's [[conditional (computer programming)|conditional statements]] are {{code|IF}} and {{code|EVALUATE}}. {{code|EVALUATE}} is a [[switch statement|switch-like statement]] with the added capability of evaluating multiple values and conditions. This can be used to implement [[decision table]]s. For example, the following might be used to control a [[CNC lathe]]: <!-- a more common appliance would be more suitable. -->\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\nEVALUATE TRUE ALSO desired-speed ALSO current-speed\n    WHEN lid-closed ALSO min-speed THRU max-speed ALSO LESS THAN desired-speed\n        PERFORM speed-up-machine\n    WHEN lid-closed ALSO min-speed THRU max-speed ALSO GREATER THAN desired-speed\n        PERFORM slow-down-machine\n    WHEN lid-open ALSO ANY ALSO NOT ZERO\n        PERFORM emergency-stop\n    WHEN OTHER\n        CONTINUE\nEND-EVALUATE\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe {{code|PERFORM}} statement is used to define loops which are executed until a condition is true (not {{em|while}}, unlike other languages). It is also used to call procedures or ranges of procedures (see the [[#Procedures|procedures section]] for more details). {{code|CALL}} and {{code|INVOKE}} call subprograms and methods, respectively. The name of the subprogram/method is contained in a string which may be a literal or a data item.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7\u00a7 14.9.4, 14.9.22}} Parameters can be passed [[call by reference|by reference]], by content (where a copy is passed by reference) or [[call by value|by value]] (but only if a [[function prototype|prototype]] is available).{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 D.6.5.2.2}}\n{{code|CANCEL}} unloads subprograms from memory. {{code|GO TO}} causes the program to jump to a specified procedure.\n\nThe {{code|GOBACK}} statement is a [[return statement]] and the {{code|STOP}} statement stops the program. The {{code|EXIT}} statement has six different formats: it can be used as a return statement, a [[break statement]], a [[continue statement]], an end marker or to leave a procedure.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a7 14.9.13.1}}\n\n[[Exception handling|Exceptions]] are raised by a {{code|RAISE}} statement and caught with a handler, or ''{{dfn|declarative}}'', defined in the {{code|DECLARATIVES}} portion of the procedure division. Declaratives are sections beginning with a {{code|USE}} statement which specify the errors to handle. Exceptions can be names or objects. {{code|RESUME}} is used in a declarative to jump to the statement after the one that raised the exception or to a procedure outside the {{code|DECLARATIVES}}. Unlike other languages, uncaught exceptions may not terminate the program and the program can proceed unaffected.\n\n=====I/O=====\nFile I/O is handled by the self-describing {{code|OPEN}}, {{code|CLOSE}}, {{code|READ}}, and {{code|WRITE}} statements along with a further three: {{code|REWRITE}}, which updates a record; {{code|START}}, which selects subsequent records to access by finding a record with a certain key; and {{code|UNLOCK}}, which releases a [[lock (database)|lock]] on the last record accessed.\n\nUser interaction is done using {{code|ACCEPT}} and {{code|DISPLAY}}.\n\n=====Data manipulation=====\nThe following verbs manipulate data:\n* {{code|INITIALIZE}}, which sets data items to their default values.\n* {{code|MOVE}}, which [[assignment (computer science)|assigns]] values to data items.\n* {{code|SET}}, which has 15 formats: it can modify indices, assign object references and alter table capacities, among other functions.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|loc=\u00a714.9.35.1}}\n* {{code|ADD}}, {{code|SUBTRACT}}, {{code|MULTIPLY}}, {{code|DIVIDE}}, and {{code|COMPUTE}}, which handle arithmetic (with {{code|COMPUTE}} assigning the result of a formula to a variable).\n* {{code|ALLOCATE}} and {{code|FREE}}, which handle [[dynamic memory]].\n* {{code|VALIDATE}}, which validates and distributes data as specified in an item's description in the data division.\n* {{code|STRING}} and {{code|UNSTRING}}, which [[Concatenation|concatenate]] and split [[string (computer science)|string]]s, respectively.\n* {{code|INSPECT}}, which tallies or replaces instances of specified [[substring]]s within a string.\n* {{code|SEARCH}}, which searches a table for the first entry satisfying a condition.\n\nFiles and tables are sorted using {{code|SORT}} and the {{code|MERGE}} verb merges and sorts files. The {{code|RELEASE}} verb provides records to sort and {{code|RETURN}} retrieves sorted records in order.\n\n====Scope termination====\nSome statements, such as {{code|IF}} and {{code|READ}}, may themselves contain statements. Such statements may be terminated in two ways: by a period (''{{dfn|implicit termination}}''), which terminates ''all'' unterminated statements contained, or by a scope terminator, which terminates the nearest matching open statement.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\n*> Terminator period (\"implicit termination\")\nIF invalid-record\n    IF no-more-records\n        NEXT SENTENCE\n    ELSE\n        READ record-file\n            AT END SET no-more-records TO TRUE.\n\n*> Scope terminators (\"explicit termination\")\nIF invalid-record\n    IF no-more-records\n        CONTINUE\n    ELSE\n        READ record-file\n            AT END SET no-more-records TO TRUE\n        END-READ\n    END-IF\nEND-IF\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nNested statements terminated with a period are a common source of bugs.{{sfn|ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 4|2014|p=899}}{{sfn|McCracken|Golden|1988|loc=\u00a7 8.4}} For example, examine the following code:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\nIF x\n    DISPLAY y.\n    DISPLAY z.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nHere, the intent is to display <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> if condition <code>x</code> is true. However, <code>z</code> will be displayed whatever the value of <code>x</code> because the <code>IF</code> statement is terminated by an erroneous period after {{code|DISPLAY y|lang=cobolfree}}.\n\nAnother bug is a result of the [[dangling else problem]], when two <code>IF</code> statements can associate with an <code>ELSE</code>.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cobolfree\">\nIF x\n    IF y\n        DISPLAY a\nELSE\n    DISPLAY b.\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the above fragment, the <code>ELSE</code> associates with the &nbsp;{{code|IF y|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; statement instead of the &nbsp;{{code|IF x|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; statement, causing a bug. Prior to the introduction of explicit scope terminators, preventing it would require &nbsp;{{code|ELSE NEXT SENTENCE|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; to be placed after the inner <code>IF</code>.{{sfn|McCracken|Golden|1988|loc=\u00a7 8.4}}\n\n====Self-modifying code====\nThe original (1959) COBOL specification supported the infamous &nbsp;{{code|ALTER X TO PROCEED TO Y|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; statement, for which many compilers generated [[self-modifying code]]. <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are procedure labels, and the single &nbsp;{{code|GO TO|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; statement in procedure <code>X</code> executed after such an {{code|ALTER}} statement means &nbsp;{{code|GO TO Y|lang=cobolfree}}&nbsp; instead.

In his letter to an editor in 1975 entitled \"How do we tell truths that might hurt?\" which was critical of several of COBOL's contemporaries, computer scientist and [[Turing Award]] recipient [[Edsger Dijkstra]] remarked that \"The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal offense.\"<ref name=\"Dijkstra1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD04xx/EWD498.html|title=E.

Tompkins defended structured COBOL: \"COBOL programs with convoluted control flow indeed tend to 'cripple the mind',\" but this was because \"There are too many such business application programs written by programmers that have never had the benefit of structured COBOL taught well...\"<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1145/948176.948186| title = In defense of teaching structured COBOL as computer science| journal = ACM SIGPLAN Notices| volume = 18| issue = 4| pages = 86| year = 1983| last1 = Tompkins | first1 = H. E. | subscription=yes}}</ref>\n\nOne cause of spaghetti code was the {{code|GO TO}} statement. Attempts to remove {{code|GO TO}}s from COBOL code, however, resulted in convoluted programs and reduced code quality.{{sfn|Riehle|1992|p=125}} {{code|GO TO}}s were largely replaced by the {{code|PERFORM}} statement and procedures, which promoted [[modular programming]]{{sfn|Riehle|1992|p=125}} and gave easy access to powerful looping facilities. However, {{code|PERFORM}} could only be used with procedures so loop bodies were not located where they were used, making programs harder to understand.{{sfn|Shneiderman|1985|pp=349\u2013350}}\n\nCOBOL programs were infamous for being monolithic and lacking modularization.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJmJAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA4 | title=Beginning COBOL for Programmers | publisher=Apress | accessdate=13 August 2014 | page=4 | first=Michael | last=Coughlan | isbn=1430262532 | date=16 March 2014}}</ref>\nCOBOL code could only be modularized through procedures, which were found to be inadequate for large systems. It was impossible to restrict access to data, meaning a procedure could access and modify {{em|any}} data item. Furthermore, there was no way to pass [[parameter (computer programming)|parameter]]s to a procedure, an omission Jean Sammet regarded as the committee's biggest mistake.{{sfn|Sammet|1978b|p=258}}\nAnother complication stemmed from the ability to {{code|PERFORM THRU}} a specified sequence of procedures. This meant that control could jump to and return from any procedure, creating convoluted control flow and permitting a programmer to break the [[single-entry single-exit]] rule.{{sfn|Riehle|1992|p=126}}\n\nThis situation improved as COBOL adopted more features. COBOL-74 added subprograms, giving programmers the ability to control the data each part of the program could access. COBOL-85 then added nested subprograms, allowing programmers to hide subprograms.{{sfn|Riehle|1992|p=127}} Further control over data and code came in 2002 when object-oriented programming, user-defined functions and user-defined data types were included.\n\nNevertheless, much important legacy COBOL software uses unstructured code, which has become unmaintainable.  It can be too risky and costly to modify even a simple section of code, since it may be used from unknown places in unknown ways.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2016/07/cobol-and-legacy-code-as-a-systemic-risk.html?imm_mid=0e6043&cmp=em-prog-na-na-newsltr_20160723|title=COBOL and Legacy Code as a Systemic Risk {{!}} naked capitalism|date=2016-07-19|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-23}}</ref>\n\n===Compatibility issues===\nCOBOL was intended to be a highly portable, \"common\" language.

Brophy, the [[Chief Information Officer|CIO]] of [[St. Paul Travelers|Travelers Insurance]], spearheaded an effort to inform COBOL users of the heavy reprogramming costs of implementing the new standard.{{sfn|Garfunkel|1987|p=11}} As a result, the ANSI COBOL Committee received more than 2,200 letters from the public, mostly negative, requiring the committee to make changes.

Proponents say that this was intended to make the code [[self-documenting]], easing program maintenance.{{sfn|Brown|1976|p=53}} COBOL was also intended to be easy for programmers to learn and use,{{sfn|CODASYL|1969|loc=\u00a7 II.1.1}} while still being readable to non-technical staff such as managers.{{sfn|Shneiderman|1985|p=350}}{{sfn|Sammet|1961|p=381}}{{sfn|Conner|1984|p=ID/10}}{{sfn|Marcotty|1978|p=263}}\nThe desire for readability led to the use of English-like syntax and structural elements, such as nouns, verbs, clauses, sentences, sections, and divisions.  Yet by 1984, maintainers of COBOL programs were struggling to deal with \"incomprehensible\" code{{sfn|Conner|1984|p=ID/10}} and the main changes in COBOL-85 were there to help ease maintenance.<ref name=\"Computerworld Garfunkel\" />\n\nJean Sammet, a short-range committee member, noted that \"little attempt was made to cater to the professional programmer, in fact people whose main interest is programming tend to be very unhappy with COBOL\" which she attributed to COBOL's verbose syntax.{{sfn|Conner|1984|p=ID/14}}\n\n===Isolation from the computer science community===\nThe COBOL community has always been isolated from the computer science community. No academic computer scientists participated in the design of COBOL: all of those on the committee came from commerce or government.  Computer scientists at the time were more interested in fields like numerical analysis, physics and system programming than the commercial file-processing problems which COBOL development tackled.{{sfn|Sammet|1961|p=380}} Jean Sammet attributed COBOL's unpopularity to an initial \"snob reaction\" due to its inelegance, the lack of influential computer scientists participating in the design process and a disdain for business data processing.{{sfn|Marcotty|1978|p=266}} The COBOL specification used a unique \"notation\", or [[metalanguage]], to define its syntax rather than the  new [[Backus\u2013Naur form]] because few committee members had heard of it. This resulted in \"severe\" criticism.{{sfn|Sammet|1978b|p=255}}{{sfn|CODASYL|1969|loc=\u00a7 2.2.5}}{{sfn|Shneiderman|1985|pp=348\u2013349}}{{sfn|Bemer|1971|p=133}}\n\nLater, COBOL suffered from a shortage of material covering it; it took until 1963 for introductory books to appear (with Richard D.
