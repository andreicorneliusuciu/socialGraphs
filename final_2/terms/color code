Similarly, [[hospital emergency codes]] often incorporate colors (such as the widely used \"Code Blue\" indicating a [[cardiac arrest]]), although they may also include numbers, and may not conform to a uniform standard.\n\nColor codes do present some potential problems. On forms and signage, the use of color can distract from black and white text.<ref name=\"Cohen\">See, e.g., Michael Richard Cohen, ''Medication Errors'' (2007), p. 119.</ref> They are often difficult for [[color blindness|color blind]] and blind people to interpret, and even for those with normal color vision, use of a large number of colors to code a large number of variables can lead to use of confusingly similar colors.<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> <ref name=\"Cohen\"/>\n\n==Examples==\nSystems incorporating color-coding include:\n\n*In electronics:\n**[[Electrical wiring]] \u2013 AC power phase, neutral, and grounding wires\n**[[Electronic color code]] \u2013 for electronic components\n**[[Jump start (vehicle)|Jumper cables]] used to jump-start a vehicle\n**[[Surround sound#Channel identification|Surround sound ports and cables]]\n**[[Audio and video interfaces and connectors#Audio|Audio connectors]]\n**[[Audio and video interfaces and connectors#Video|Video connectors]]\n**[[Color coding of optical fibers|Optical fibers]]\n**[[PC System Design Guide#Color-coding scheme for connectors and ports|PC connectors and ports]]\n**[[Three-phase electric power#Color codes|Three-phase electric power]] (electrical wiring)\n**[[25-pair color code]] \u2013 telecommunications wiring\n**[[Ethernet_physical_layer#Twisted-pair_cable|Ethernet twisted-pair wiring]] - local area networks\n*In video games\n**[[Minecraft]]\n**[[Health (gaming)|Health]] and [[Magic (gaming)|magic points]]\n**To distinguish friend from foe, for instance in [[Starcraft]], [[Halo (game)|Halo]], or [[League of Legends]]\n**To distinguish rarity or quality of items in adventure and [[role-playing game]]s<ref>{{cite web|title=Color-Coded Loot|publisher=Giant Bomb|url=http://giantbomb.com/color-coded-loot/3015-4702/|accessdate=13 June 2016}}</ref>\n*In navigation:\n**[[Navigation light]]\n**[[Sea mark]]\n**[[Characteristic light]]\n**[[Traffic light]]s\n*Other technology:\n**[[Bottled gas]]es\n**[[Fire extinguisher]]s\n**[[Utility color code|Underground utility location]]\n**[[Black hat hacking]], [[White hat (computer security)|white hat]], [[grey hat]]\n*In military use:\n**[[NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems#Affiliation]]\n**[[Artillery shell]]s and other munitions, which are color-coded according to their pyrotechnic contents\n**[[Rainbow Herbicides]]\n**[[List of Rainbow Codes]]\n*In social functions:\n**[[ISO 22324]], Guidelines for color-coded alerts in public warning\n**[[Handkerchief code]]\n**[[Ribbon]] colors ''see:'' [[:Category:Ribbon symbolism]]\n**[[Rank in Judo]]\n**[[Blue-collar worker]], [[white-collar worker]], [[pink-collar worker]], [[gold-collar worker]], [[grey-collar]], [[green-collar worker]]\n*At point of sale (especially for [[packaging]] within a huge range of [[Stock keeping unit|products]]: to quickly differentiate variants, brands, categories)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Color code}}\n\n{{color topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Color Code}}\n[[Category:Color codes| ]]\n[[Category:Encodings]]"}]}}}}
