The spreading of this signal makes the resulting [[wideband]]  channel more [[White noise|noisy]], allowing for greater resistance to unintentional and intentional interference.<ref name=\"Haykin4E\">{{cite book|last1=Haykin|first1=Simon|title=Communication systems|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|pages=488\u201399|edition=4|url=https://archive.org/details/CommunicationSystems4thEditionSimonHaykinsolutionsManual|accessdate=11 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nA method of achieving the spreading of a given signal is provided by the modulation scheme. With DSSS, the message signal is used to modulate a bit sequence known as a [[Pseudorandom noise#PN code|Pseudo Noise (PN)]] code; this PN code consists of a radio pulse that is much shorter in duration (larger bandwidth) than the original message signal. This modulation of the message signal scrambles and spreads the pieces of data, and thereby resulting in a bandwidth size nearly identical to that of the PN sequence.<ref name=Haykin4E/> In this context, the duration of the radio pulse for the PN code is referred to as the [[Chip (CDMA)|chip]] duration. The smaller this duration, the larger the bandwidth of the resulting DSSS signal; more bandwidth multiplexed to the message signal results in better resistance against interference.<ref name=Haykin4E/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.telecomabc.com/d/dsss.html|title=DSSS - Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum - Telecom ABC|website=www.telecomabc.com|access-date=2016-11-11}}</ref>\n\nSome practical and effective uses of DSSS include the [[Code Division Multiple Access]] (CDMA) [[channel access method]] and the [[IEEE 802.11#802.11b|IEEE 802.11b]] specification used in [[Wi-Fi]] networks.<ref name=TRappaport>{{cite book|last1=Rappaport|first1=Theodore|title=Wireless Communications Principles and Practice|date=January 2010|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc|page=458|edition=2|url=http://www.pearson.ch/1471/9780130422323/Wireless-Communications-Principles-and.aspx|accessdate=11 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Citation\n|title=Capacity, Coverage and Deployment Considerations for IEEE 802.11G | year =2005| pages =1| publisher =Cisco Systems, Inc| url =https://www.cisco.com/application/pdf/en/us/guest/products/ps430/c1244/ccmigration_09186a00801d61a3.pdf\n}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Expand section|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Features==\n# DSSS [[Phase-shift keying|phase-shifts]] a [[sine wave]] [[Pseudorandomness|pseudorandom]]ly with a continuous [[string (computer science)|string]] of [[pseudorandom noise|pseudonoise]] (PN) [[code]] symbols called \"[[Chip (CDMA)|chips]]\", each of which has a much shorter duration than an information [[bit]]. That is, each information bit is modulated by a sequence of much faster chips. Therefore, the [[Chip (CDMA)|chip rate]] is much higher than the [[information]] signal [[Baud|bit rate]].\n# DSSS uses a [[signaling (telecommunication)|signal]] structure in which the sequence of chips produced by the transmitter is already known by the receiver. The receiver can then use the same ''[[PN Sequences|PN sequence]]'' to counteract the effect of the PN sequence on the received signal in order to reconstruct the information signal.\n\n==Transmission method==\nDirect-sequence spread-spectrum transmissions multiply the data being transmitted by a \"noise\" signal. This noise signal is a pseudorandom sequence of <code>1</code> and <code>\u22121</code> values; at a frequency much higher than that of the original signal.\n\nThe resulting signal resembles [[white noise]], like an audio recording of \"static\".  However, this noise-like signal is used to exactly reconstruct the original data at the receiving end, by multiplying it by the same pseudorandom sequence (because 1 \u00d7 1 = 1, and \u22121 \u00d7 \u22121 = 1). This process, known as \"de-spreading\", mathematically constitutes a [[correlation]] of the transmitted PN sequence with the PN sequence that the receiver already knows the transmitter is using.\n\nThe resulting effect of enhancing [[signal to noise ratio]] on the channel is called ''[[process gain]]''. This effect can be made larger by employing a longer PN sequence and more chips per bit, but physical devices used to generate the PN sequence impose practical limits on attainable processing gain.\n\nWhile for useful [[process gain]] the transmitted DSSS signal must occupy much wider bandwidth than simple [[Amplitude modulation|a.m.]] of the original signal alone would require, its frequency spectrum can be somewhat restricted for spectrum economy by a conventional analog bandpass filter to give a roughly bell-shaped envelope centered on the [[carrier frequency]]. In contrast, [[frequency-hopping spread spectrum]] which pseudo-randomly re-tunes the carrier, instead of adding pseudo-random noise to the data, requires a uniform frequency response since any bandwidth shaping would cause amplitude modulation of the signal by the hopping code.\n\nIf an undesired transmitter transmits on the same channel but with a different PN sequence (or no sequence at all), the de-spreading process has reduced processing gain for that signal. This effect is the basis for the [[code division multiple access]] (CDMA) property of DSSS, which allows multiple transmitters to share the same channel within the limits of the [[cross-correlation]] properties of their PN sequences.\n\n==Benefits==\n* Resistance to unintended or intended [[Radio jamming|jamming]]\n* Sharing of a single channel among multiple users\n* Reduced signal/background-noise level hampers [[signals intelligence|interception]]\n* Determination of relative timing between transmitter and receiver\n\n==Uses==\n* The United States [[GPS]], European [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]] and Russian [[GLONASS]] [[satellite navigation]] systems; earlier GLONASS used DSSS with a single PN code in conjunction with [[FDMA]], while latter GLONASS used DSSS to achieve [[CDMA]] with multiple PN codes\n* DS-CDMA (Direct-Sequence Code Division Multiple Access) is a [[multiple access]] scheme based on DSSS, by spreading the signals from/to different users with different codes.
