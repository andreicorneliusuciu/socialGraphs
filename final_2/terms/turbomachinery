While a turbine transfers energy from a fluid to a rotor, a compressor transfers energy from a rotor to a fluid.<ref name=\"Logan1\">Logan, Earl. \"Handbook of turbomachinery\". 1995.

Memorial University of Newfoundland. http://www.engr.mun.ca/~yuri/Courses/MechanicalSystems/Turbomachinery.pdf</ref>\n\nThese two types of machines are governed by the same basic relationships including [[Newton's Laws of Motion|Newton's second Law of Motion]] and [[Euler's pump and turbine equation]] for [[compressible fluid]]s.  [[Centrifugal pump]]s are also turbomachines that transfer energy from a rotor to a fluid, usually a liquid, while turbines and compressors usually work with a gas.<ref name=\"Logan1\" />\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:SteamTurbine.jpg|thumb|A steam turbine from [[MAN SE]] subdidiary MAN Turbo]]\nIn general, the two kinds of turbomachines encountered in practice are open and closed turbomachines. Open machines such as [[propeller]]s, [[windmill]]s, and unshrouded [[Mechanical fan|fan]]s act on an infinite extent of fluid, whereas, closed machines operate on a finite quantity of fluid as it passes through a housing or casing.<ref name=\"Tamili1\" />\n\nTurbomachines are also categorized according to the type of flow. When the flow is parallel to the [[axis of rotation]], they are called axial flow machines, and when flow is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, they are referred to as radial (or centrifugal) flow machines. There is also a third category, called mixed flow machines, where both radial and axial flow velocity components are present.<ref name=\"Tamili1\" />\n\nTurbomachines may be further classified into two additional categories: those that absorb energy to increase the [[fluid pressure]], i.e. [[pump]]s, [[Fan (mechanical)|fans]], and [[Gas compressor|compressors]], and those that produce energy such as [[turbine]]s by expanding flow to lower pressures. Of particular interest are applications which contain pumps, fans, compressors and turbines. These components are essential in almost all mechanical equipment systems, such as power and [[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration cycles]].<ref name=\"Tamili1\" /><ref name=\"Bask1\">Baskharone, E.

Elaborating, a turbomachine is a power or head generating machine which employs the dynamic action of a rotating element, the rotor; the action of the rotor changes the energy level of the continuously flowing fluid through the machine. Turbines, compressors and fans are all members of this family of machines.<ref name=\"Raja1\">Rajadurai, J. S. \"Thermodynamics and thermal engineering\". 2003. New Age International. ISBN 81-224-1493-1</ref>\n\nIn contrast to positive displacement machines (particularly of the reciprocating type which are low speed machines based on the mechanical and volumetric efficiency considerations), the majority of turbomachines run at comparatively higher speeds without any mechanical problems and volumetric efficiency close to one hundred percent.<ref name=\"SOCO1\">\"Combining Support Vector Machines and Segmentation Algorithms for Efficient Anomaly Detection: A Petroleum Industry Application\".

ISBN 978-3-319-07995-0</ref>\n\n===Categorization===\n\n====Energy conversion====\nTurbomachines can be categorized on the basis of the direction of energy conversion:<ref name=\"Logan1\" /><ref name=\"Tamili1\" />\n\n* Absorb power to increase the fluid pressure or head (ducted Fans, compressors and pumps).\n* Produce power by expanding fluid to a lower pressure or head (hydraulic, steam and gas turbines).\n\n====Fluid flow====\nTurbomachines can be categorized on the basis of the nature of flow path through the passage of the rotor:<ref name=\"Mobil1\">Wills, J. George. \"Lubrication fundamentals\". 1980. Mobil oil corporation. Marcel Dekker. 460 pages. ISBN 0-8247-6976-7</ref>\n\n* [[File:Axial Turbomachine's Velocity Diagram.svg|thumb|centre|Axial Turbomachine's Velocity Diagram<ref name=\"Logan1\" />]]\n''[[Axial flow|Axial flow turbomachines]]'' - When the path of the through-flow is wholly or mainly parallel to the axis of rotation, the device is termed an axial flow turbomachine.<ref name=\"Dixon1\">Dixon, S. L. \"Fluid mechanics and thermodynamics of turbomachinery\". 1998. Elsevier. 460 pages. ISBN 0-7506-7870-4</ref> The radial component of the fluid velocity is negligible. Since there is no change in the direction of the fluid, several axial stages can be used to increase power output.\n\nA [[Kaplan turbine]] is an example of an axial flow turbine.\n\nIn the figure:\n*U = Blade velocity,\n*V<sub>f</sub> = Flow velocity,\n*V = Absolute velocity,\n*V<sub>r</sub> = Relative velocity,\n*V<sub>w</sub> = Tangential or Whirl component of velocity.\n* [[File:Radial Turbomachine's Velocity Diagram.svg|thumb|centre|Radial Turbomachine's Velocity Diagram<ref name=\"Logan1\" />]]\n''[[Radial turbine|Radial flow turbomachines]]'' - When the path of the through-flow is wholly or mainly in a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis, the device is termed a radial flow turbomachine.<ref name=\"Dixon1\" /> Therefore, the change of radius between the entry and the exit is finite. A Radial turbomachine can be inward or outward flow type depending on the purpose that needs to be served. Outward flow type increases the energy level of the fluid and vice versa. Due to continuous change in direction, several radial stages are generally not used.\n\nA [[centrifugal pump]] is an example of a radial flow turbine.\n\nIn the figure:\n*U = Blade velocity,\n*V<sub>f</sub> = Flow velocity,\n*V = Absolute velocity,\n*V<sub>r</sub> = Relative velocity,\n*V<sub>w</sub> = Tangential or Whirl component of velocity.\n\n''[[Mixed flow compressor|Mixed flow turbomachines]]'' \u2013 When axial and radial flow are both present and neither is negligible, the device is termed a mixed flow turbomachine.<ref name=\"Dixon1\" /> It combines flow and force components of both radial and axial types.\n\nA [[Francis turbine]] is an example of a mixed-flow turbine.\n\n====Physical action====\nTurbomachines can finally be classified on the relative magnitude of the pressure changes that take place across a stage:<ref name=\"Tamili1\" /><ref name=\"Bask1\" />\n\n* [[File:An Impulse Turbomachine Stage.svg|thumb|centre|An Impulse Turbomachine Stage<ref name=\"Logan1\" />]]\n''Impulse Turbomachines'' operate by accelerating and changing the flow direction of fluid through a stationary [[nozzle]] (the stator blade) onto the rotor blade. The nozzle serves to change the incoming pressure into velocity, the [[enthalpy]] of the fluid decreases as the velocity increases. Pressure and enthalpy drop over the rotor blades is minimal. Velocity will decrease over the rotor.<ref name=\"Logan1\" /><ref name=\"Dixon1\" />\n\n[[Newton's second law]] describes the transfer of energy. Impulse turbomachines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blading on the rotor.\n\nA [[Pelton wheel]] is an impulse design.\n\n* [[File:A Reaction Turbomachine Stage.svg|thumb|centre|A Reaction Turbomachine Stage<ref name=\"Logan1\" />]]\n''Reaction Turbomachines'' operate by reacting to the flow of fluid through aerofoil shaped rotor and stator blades. The velocity of the fluid through the sets of blades increases slightly (as with a nozzle) as it passes from rotor to stator and vice versa. The velocity of the fluid then decreases again once it has passed between the gap. Pressure and enthalpy consistently decrease through the sets of blades.<ref name=\"Logan1\" />\n\n[[Newton's third law]] describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently.\n\nMost turbomachines use a combination of impulse and reaction in their design, often with impulse and reaction parts on the same blade.\n\n==Dimensionless ratios to describe turbomachinery==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n[[File:Walchenseewerk Pelton 120.jpg|thumb|[[Pelton wheel]] being installed into [[Walchensee Hydroelectric Power Station]].]]\nThe following dimensionless ratios are often used for the characterisation of fluid machines.  They allow a comparison of flow machines with different dimensions and boundary conditions.\n#Pressure range '''\u03c8'''\n#Flow number '''\u03c6''' (including delivery or volume number called)\n#Performance numbers '''\u03bb'''\n#Run number '''\u03c3'''\n#Diameter Number '''\u03b4'''\n\n==Partial list of turbomachine topics==\nMany types of dynamic continuous flow turbomachinery exist.  Below is a partial list of these types.  What is notable about these turbomachines is that the same fundamentals apply to all.  Certainly there are significant differences between these machines and between the types of analysis that are typically applied to specific cases.  This does not negate the fact that they are unified by the same underlying physics of fluid dynamics, gas dynamics, aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, and thermodynamics.\n\n{{multicol}}\n*[[Axial compressor]]\n*[[Axial fan]]\n*[[Centrifugal compressor]]\n*[[Centrifugal fan]]\n*[[Centrifugal pump]]\n*[[Centrifugal type supercharger]]\n* [[Exoskeletal engine]]\n*[[Francis turbine]]\n*[[Gas turbine]]\n*[[Industrial fans]]\n*[[Jet engine]]\n*[[Mechanical fan]]\n{{multicol-break}}\n*[[Mixed flow compressor]]\n*[[Radial turbine]]\n*[[Steam turbine]]\n*[[Turbocharger]]\n*[[Turboexpander]]\n*[[Turbofans]]\n*[[Turbojet]]\n*[[Turboprop]]\n*[[Turbopump]]\n*[[Turboshaft]]\n*[[Turbines]]\n*[[Water turbine]]\n{{multicol-end}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[secondary flow#Turbomachinery|Secondary flow in turbomachinery]]\n* [[Slip factor]]\n* [[Blade solidity]]\n* [[Three-dimensional losses and correlation in turbomachinery]]\n* [[Effects of mach number and shock losses in turbomachines]]\n\n==Sources==\n* S.
