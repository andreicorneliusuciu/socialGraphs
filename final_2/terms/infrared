Infrared energy excites [[vibration]]al modes in a [[molecule]] through a change in the [[Molecular dipole moment|dipole moment]], making it a useful frequency range for study of these energy states for molecules of the proper symmetry.

At zenith, sunlight provides an [[irradiance]] of just over 1&nbsp;[[kilowatt]] per square meter at sea level. Of this energy, 527 watts is infrared radiation, 445 watts is [[visible light]], and 32 watts is [[ultraviolet]] radiation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/ |title=Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance:  Air Mass 1.5|accessdate=2009-11-12}}</ref> Nearly all the infrared radiation in sunlight is near infrared, shorter than 4 micrometers.\n\nOn the surface of Earth, at far lower temperatures than the surface of the Sun, almost all thermal radiation consists of infrared in mid-infrared region, much longer than in sunlight. Of these natural thermal radiation processes only lightning and natural fires are hot enough to produce much visible energy, and fires produce far more infrared than visible-light energy.\n\n==Regions within the infrared==<!--Mid-infrared redirects here-->\n\nIn general, objects emit infrared radiation across a spectrum of wavelengths, but sometimes only a limited region of the spectrum is of interest because sensors usually collect radiation only within a specific bandwidth. Thermal infrared radiation also has a maximum emission wavelength, which is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature of object, in accordance with [[Wien's displacement law]].\n\nTherefore, the infrared band is often subdivided into smaller sections.\n\n=== Commonly used sub-division scheme ===\n\nA commonly used sub-division scheme is:<ref name=\"Byrnes\">{{Cite book|last=Byrnes |first=James |title=Unexploded Ordnance Detection and Mitigation |publisher=Springer |year=2009 |pages=21\u201322 |isbn=978-1-4020-9252-7}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Division&nbsp;Name'''\n|'''Abbreviation'''\n|'''Wavelength'''\n|'''Frequency'''\n|'''Photon&nbsp;Energy'''\n|'''Temperature\u2020'''\n|'''Characteristics'''\n|-\n|'''[[Near-infrared spectroscopy|Near-infrared]]'''\n|NIR, IR-A ''[[DIN]]''\n| 0.75\u20131.4&nbsp;[[\u00b5m]]\n| 214\u2013400&nbsp;[[Terahertz (unit)|THz]]\n| 886\u20131653&nbsp;[[meV]]\n| {{convert|3864|\u2013|2070|K|C|lk=on|disp=br()}}\n| Defined by the water absorption, and commonly used in [[fiber optic]] telecommunication because of low attenuation losses in the SiO<sub>2</sub> glass ([[silica]]) medium.

Other definitions follow different physical mechanisms (emission peaks, vs. bands, water absorption) and the newest follow technical reasons (the common [[silicon]] detectors are sensitive to about 1,050&nbsp;nm, while [[indium gallium arsenide|InGaAs]]'s sensitivity starts around 950&nbsp;nm and ends between 1,700 and 2,600&nbsp;nm, depending on the specific configuration). Unfortunately, international standards for these specifications are not currently available.\n\nThe onset of infrared is defined (according to different standards) at various values typically between 700&nbsp;nm and 800&nbsp;nm, but the boundary between visible and infrared light is not precisely defined. The human eye is markedly less sensitive to light above 700&nbsp;nm wavelength, so longer wavelengths make insignificant contributions to scenes illuminated by common light sources. However, particularly intense near-IR light (e.g., from IR [[laser]]s, IR LED sources, or from bright daylight with the visible light removed by colored gels) can be detected up to approximately 780&nbsp;nm, and will be perceived as red light. Intense light sources providing wavelengths as long as 1050&nbsp;nm can be seen as a dull red glow, causing some difficulty in near-IR illumination of scenes in the dark (usually this practical problem is solved by indirect illumination). Leaves are particularly bright in the near IR, and if all visible light leaks from around an IR-filter are blocked, and the eye is given a moment to adjust to the extremely dim image coming through a visually opaque IR-passing photographic filter, it is possible to see the [[Wood effect]] that consists of IR-glowing foliage.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Sensitivity of the Human Eye to Infra-Red Radiation |journal= Journal of the Optical Society of America |volume=37 |issue=7 |pages=546\u2013553 |year=1947 |doi=10.1364/JOSA.37.000546|last1=Griffin|first1=Donald R.|last2=Hubbard|first2=Ruth|last3=Wald|first3=George}}</ref>\n\n===Telecommunication bands in the infrared===\n\nIn [[optical communications]], the part of the infrared spectrum that is used is divided into seven bands based on availability of light sources transmitting/absorbing materials (fibers) and detectors:<ref>{{cite web|last=Ramaswami |first=Rajiv |date=May 2002 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/35/21724/01006983.pdf |format=PDF |title=Optical Fiber Communication: From Transmission to Networking |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=2006-10-18}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Band\n!Descriptor\n!Wavelength range\n|-\n|O band\n|Original\n|1260\u20131360&nbsp;nm\n|-\n|E band\n|Extended\n|1360\u20131460&nbsp;nm\n|-\n|S band\n|Short wavelength\n|1460\u20131530&nbsp;nm\n|-\n|[[C band (infrared)|C band]]\n|Conventional\n|1530\u20131565&nbsp;nm\n|-\n|L band\n|Long wavelength\n|1565\u20131625&nbsp;nm\n|-\n|U band\n|Ultralong wavelength\n|1625\u20131675&nbsp;nm\n|}\n\nThe C-band is the dominant band for long-distance [[telecommunication]] networks.

Unlike heat transmitted by [[thermal conduction]] or [[thermal convection]], thermal radiation can propagate through a [[vacuum]]. Thermal radiation is characterized by a particular spectrum of many wavelengths that is associated with emission from an object, due to the vibration of its molecules at a given temperature. Thermal radiation can be emitted from objects at any wavelength, and at very high temperatures such radiations are associated with spectra far above the infrared, extending into visible, ultraviolet, and even X-ray regions (e.g. the [[solar corona]]). Thus, the popular association of infrared radiation with thermal radiation is only a coincidence based on typical (comparatively low) temperatures often found near the surface of planet Earth.\n\nThe concept of [[emissivity]] is important in understanding the infrared emissions of objects. This is a property of a surface that describes how its thermal emissions deviate from the ideal of a [[black body]]. To further explain, two objects at the same physical temperature will not show the same infrared image if they have differing emissivity. For example, for any pre-set emissivity value, objects with higher emissivity will appear hotter, and those with a lower emissivity will appear cooler. For that reason, incorrect selection of emissivity will give inaccurate results when using infrared cameras and pyrometers.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Refimprove section|date=August 2007}}\n\n===Night vision===\n{{Main article|Night vision}}\n[[File:Active-Infrared-Night-Vision.jpg|thumb|Active-infrared night vision : the camera illuminates the scene at infrared wavelengths invisible to the [[human eye]].

This is termed thermography, or in the case of very hot objects in the NIR or visible it is termed [[pyrometry]]. Thermography (thermal imaging) is mainly used in military and industrial applications but the technology is reaching the public market in the form of infrared cameras on cars due to the massively reduced production costs.\n\n[[Thermographic cameras]] detect radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum (roughly 900\u201314,000 nanometers or 0.9\u201314&nbsp;\u03bcm) and produce images of that radiation. Since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects based on their temperatures, according to the [[black body]] radiation law, thermography makes it possible to \"see\" one's environment with or without visible illumination. The amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature, therefore thermography allows one to see variations in temperature (hence the name).\n\n===Hyperspectral imaging===\n{{Main article|Hyperspectral imaging}}\n\n[[File:Specim aisaowl outdoor.png|thumb|left| Hyperspectral thermal infrared [[Emission spectrum|emission]] measurement, an outdoor scan in winter conditions, ambient temperature \u221215&nbsp;\u00b0C, image produced with a [[Specim]] LWIR hyperspectral imager. Relative radiance spectra from various targets in the image are shown with arrows. The [[Infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectra]] of the different objects such as the watch clasp have clearly distinctive characteristics. The contrast level indicates the temperature of the object.<ref name=Holma>Holma, H., (May 2011), [http://www.photonik.de/index.php?id=11&np=5&artid=848&L=1 Thermische Hyperspektralbildgebung im langwelligen Infrarot], Photonik</ref>]] [[File:P1020168.JPG|thumb|Infrared light from the [[LED]] of a [[remote control]] as recorded by a digital camera.]]\n\nA hyperspectral image, a basis for chemical imaging, is a \"picture\" containing continuous [[Infrared spectroscopy|spectrum]] through a wide spectral range. Hyperspectral imaging is gaining importance in the applied spectroscopy particularly in the fields of NIR, SWIR, MWIR, and LWIR spectral regions. Typical applications include biological, mineralogical, defence, and industrial measurements.\n\nThermal Infrared Hyperspectral Camera can be applied similarly to a [[Thermographic camera]], with the fundamental difference that each pixel contains a full LWIR spectrum. Consequently, chemical identification of the object can be performed without a need for an external light source such as the Sun or the Moon. Such cameras are typically applied for geological measurements, outdoor surveillance and [[UAV]] applications.<ref name=\"Frost&Sullivan Specim Owl\">Frost&Sullivan, Technical Insights, Aerospace&Defence (Feb 2011): [http://www.frost.com/prod/servlet/segment-toc.pag?segid=D870-00-48-00-00&ctxixpLink=FcmCtx3&ctxixpLabel=FcmCtx4  World First Thermal Hyperspectral Camera for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles]</ref>\n\n===Other imaging===\nIn [[infrared photography]], [[infrared filter]]s are used to capture the near-infrared spectrum. [[Digital camera]]s often use infrared [[Filter (optics)|blockers]]. Cheaper digital cameras and [[camera phones]] have less effective filters and can \"see\" intense near-infrared, appearing as a bright purple-white color. This is especially pronounced when taking pictures of subjects near IR-bright areas (such as near a lamp), where the resulting infrared interference can wash out the image. There is also a technique called '[[Terahertz radiation|T-ray]]' imaging, which is imaging using [[far-infrared]] or [[terahertz radiation]]. Lack of bright sources can make terahertz photography more challenging than most other infrared imaging techniques. Recently T-ray imaging has been of considerable interest due to a number of new developments such as [[terahertz time-domain spectroscopy]].\n[[File:Infrared portrait comparison.jpg|thumb|Reflected light photograph in various infrared spectra to illustrate the appearance as the wavelength of light changes.]]\n\n===Tracking===\n{{Main article|Infrared homing}}\nInfrared tracking, also known as infrared homing, refers to a [[Missile guidance#Passive homing|passive missile guidance system]], which uses the [[light emission|emission]] from a target of [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the infrared part of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] to track it. Missiles that use infrared seeking are often referred to as \"heat-seekers\", since infrared (IR) is just below the visible spectrum of light in frequency and is radiated strongly by hot bodies. Many objects such as people, vehicle engines, and aircraft generate and retain heat, and as such, are especially visible in the infrared wavelengths of light compared to objects in the background.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Mahulikar,  S.P. |author2=Sonawane, H.R. |author3=Rao, G.A.|year=2007|title=Infrared signature studies of aerospace vehicles|journal=Progress in Aerospace Sciences|volume=43|issue=7\u20138|pages= 218\u2013245|url=http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10054/613/5740.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.paerosci.2007.06.002|bibcode = 2007PrAeS..43..218M }}</ref>\n\n===Heating===\n{{Main article|Infrared heating}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}\nInfrared radiation can be used as a deliberate heating source. For example, it is used in infrared saunas to heat the occupants. It may also be used in other heating applications, such as to remove ice from the wings of aircraft (de-icing).<ref>Patent\nUS 6092765 A [https://www.google.com/patents/US6092765]\"Infrared deicing system for aircraft\"</ref> Infrared can be used in cooking and heating food as it predominantly heats the opaque, absorbent objects, rather than the air around them.\n\nInfrared heating is also becoming more popular in industrial manufacturing processes, e.g. curing of coatings, forming of plastics, annealing, plastic welding, and print drying. In these applications, infrared heaters replace convection ovens and contact heating.\n\nEfficiency is achieved by matching the wavelength of the infrared heater to the absorption characteristics of the material.\n\n===Communications===\nIR data transmission is also employed in short-range communication among computer peripherals and [[personal digital assistant]]s. These devices usually conform to standards published by [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]], the Infrared Data Association. Remote controls and IrDA devices use infrared [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) to emit infrared radiation that is focused by a plastic [[Lens (optics)|lens]] into a narrow beam. The beam is [[modulation|modulated]], i.e. switched on and off, to prevent interference from other sources of infrared (like sunlight or artificial lighting). The receiver uses a [[silicon]] [[photodiode]] to convert the infrared radiation to an [[electric current]]. It responds only to the rapidly pulsing signal created by the transmitter, and filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from ambient light. Infrared communications are useful for indoor use in areas of high population density. IR does not penetrate walls and so does not interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms. Infrared is the most common way for [[remote control]]s to command appliances.\nInfrared remote control protocols like [[RC-5]], [[Sony Infrared Remote Control|SIRC]], are used to communicate with infrared.\n\n[[Free space optical communication]] using infrared [[laser]]s can be a relatively inexpensive way to install a communications link in an urban area operating at up to 4 gigabit/s, compared to the cost of burying fiber optic cable, except for the radiation damage.  \"Since the eye cannot detect IR, blinking or closing the eyes to help prevent or reduce damage may not happen.\"<ref>http://www.ishn.com/articles/94815-dangers-of-overexposure-to-ultraviolet-infrared-and-high-energy-visible-light</ref>\n\nInfrared lasers are used to provide the light for [[optical fiber]] communications systems. Infrared light with a wavelength around 1,330&nbsp;nm (least [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]]) or 1,550&nbsp;nm (best transmission) are the best choices for standard [[silica]] fibers.\n\nIR data transmission of encoded audio versions of printed signs is being researched as an aid for visually impaired people through the [[RIAS (Remote Infrared Audible Signage)]] project.\n\n===Spectroscopy===\n[[Infrared spectroscopy|Infrared vibrational spectroscopy]] (see also [[near-infrared spectroscopy]]) is a technique that can be used to identify molecules by analysis of their constituent bonds. Each chemical bond in a molecule vibrates at a frequency characteristic of that bond. A group of atoms in a molecule (e.g., CH<sub>2</sub>) may have multiple modes of oscillation caused by the stretching and bending motions of the group as a whole. If an oscillation leads to a change in [[dipole]] in the molecule then it will absorb a [[photon]] that has the same frequency. The vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to the frequencies of infrared light. Typically, the technique is used to study [[organic compound]]s using light radiation from 4000\u2013400&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>, the mid-infrared. A spectrum of all the frequencies of absorption in a sample is recorded. This can be used to gain information about the sample composition in terms of chemical groups present and also its purity (for example, a wet sample will show a broad O-H absorption around 3200&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>).\n\n===Thin film metrology===\nIn the semiconductor industry, infrared light can be used to characterize materials such as thin films and periodic trench structures. By measuring the reflectance of light from the surface of a semiconductor wafer, the index of refraction (n) and the extinction Coefficient (k) can be determined via the [[Refractive index and extinction coefficient of thin film materials|Forouhi-Bloomer dispersion equations]]. The reflectance from the infrared light can also be used to determine the critical dimension, depth, and sidewall angle of high aspect ratio trench structures.\n\n===Meteorology===\n[[File:US IR satpic.JPG|thumb|left| IR Satellite picture taken 1315 Z on 15th October 2006. A [[weather front|frontal]] system can be seen in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with embedded Cumulonimbus cloud. Shallower Cumulus and Stratocumulus can be seen off the [[Eastern Seaboard]].]]\n[[Weather satellite]]s equipped with scanning radiometers produce thermal or infrared images, which can then enable a trained analyst to determine cloud heights and types, to calculate land and surface water temperatures, and to locate ocean surface features. The scanning is typically in the range 10.3\u201312.5&nbsp;\u00b5m (IR4 and IR5 channels).\n\nHigh, cold ice clouds such as [[Cirrus cloud|Cirrus]] or [[Cumulonimbus]] show up bright white, lower warmer clouds such as [[Stratus cloud|Stratus]] or [[Stratocumulus]] show up as grey with intermediate clouds shaded accordingly. Hot land surfaces will show up as dark-grey or black. One disadvantage of infrared imagery is that low cloud such as stratus or [[fog]] can be a similar temperature to the surrounding land or sea surface and does not show up. However, using the difference in brightness of the IR4 channel (10.3\u201311.5&nbsp;\u00b5m) and the near-infrared channel (1.58\u20131.64&nbsp;\u00b5m), low cloud can be distinguished, producing a ''fog'' satellite picture. The main advantage of infrared is that images can be produced at night, allowing a continuous sequence of weather to be studied.\n\nThese infrared pictures can depict ocean eddies or vortices and map currents such as the Gulf Stream, which are valuable to the shipping industry. Fishermen and farmers are interested in knowing land and water temperatures to protect their crops against frost or increase their catch from the sea. Even [[El Ni\u00f1o]] phenomena can be spotted. Using color-digitized techniques, the gray-shaded thermal images can be converted to color for easier identification of desired information.\n\nThe main water vapour channel at 6.40 to 7.08&nbsp;\u00b5m can be imaged by some weather satellites and shows the amount of moisture in the atmosphere.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Climatology===\nIn the field of climatology, atmospheric infrared radiation is monitored to detect trends in the energy exchange between the earth and the atmosphere. These trends provide information on long-term changes in Earth's climate. It is one of the primary parameters studied in research into [[global warming]], together with [[solar radiation]].\n\nA [[pyrgeometer]] is utilized in this field of research to perform continuous outdoor measurements. This is a broadband infrared radiometer with sensitivity for infrared radiation between approximately 4.5&nbsp;\u00b5m and 50&nbsp;\u00b5m.\n\n===Astronomy===\n{{Main article|Infrared astronomy|far-infrared astronomy}}\n[[File:ESO - Beta Pictoris planet finally imaged (by).jpg|thumb|[[Beta Pictoris]], the light-blue dot off-center, as seen in infrared. It combines two images, the inner disc is at 3.6&nbsp;\u00b5m.]]\nAstronomers observe objects in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum using optical components, including mirrors, lenses and solid state digital detectors. For this reason it is classified as part of [[optical astronomy]]. To form an image, the components of an infrared telescope need to be carefully shielded from heat sources, and the detectors are chilled using liquid [[helium]].\n\nThe sensitivity of Earth-based infrared telescopes is significantly limited by water vapor in the atmosphere, which absorbs a portion of the infrared radiation arriving from space outside of selected [[Infrared window|atmospheric window]]s. This limitation can be partially alleviated by placing the telescope observatory at a high altitude, or by carrying the telescope aloft with a balloon or an aircraft. Space telescopes do not suffer from this handicap, and so outer space is considered the ideal location for infrared astronomy.\n\nThe infrared portion of the spectrum has several useful benefits for astronomers. Cold, dark [[molecular cloud]]s of gas and dust in our galaxy will glow with radiated heat as they are irradiated by imbedded stars. Infrared can also be used to detect [[protostar]]s before they begin to emit visible light. Stars emit a smaller portion of their energy in the infrared spectrum, so nearby cool objects such as [[planet]]s can be more readily detected. (In the visible light spectrum, the glare from the star will drown out the reflected light from a planet.)\n\nInfrared light is also useful for observing the cores of [[active galaxy|active galaxies]], which are often cloaked in gas and dust. Distant galaxies with a high [[redshift]] will have the peak portion of their spectrum shifted toward longer wavelengths, so they are more readily observed in the infrared.<ref name=\"ir_astronomy\" />\n\n===Infrared cleaning===\n[[Infrared cleaning]] is a technique used by some [[Motion picture film scanner]], [[film scanner]]s and [[flatbed scanner]]s to reduce or remove the effect of dust and scratches upon the finished [[image scanning|scan]]. It works by collecting an additional infrared channel from the scan at the same position and resolution as the three visible color channels (red, green, and blue). The infrared channel, in combination with the other channels, is used to detect the location of scratches and dust. Once located, those defects can be corrected by scaling or replaced by [[inpainting]].<ref>[http://www.thepixelfarm.co.uk/pfclean/ PF Clean]</ref><ref>[motion.kodak.com/US/en/motion/Products/Lab_And_Post_Production/dice.htm kodak.com, Digital ICE]</ref>\n\n===Art conservation and analysis===\n[[File:Van Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|180px|''[[The Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], [[National Gallery, London]]]]\n[[File:Infrared reflectography-en.svg|right|200px]]\n{{Interlanguage link multi|Infrared reflectography|2=fr|3=r\u00e9flectographie infrarouge|4=it|5=Riflettografia|6=es|7=Reflectograf\u00eda infrarroja|preserve=1}}, as called by art conservators,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sensorsinc.com/artanalysis.html |title=IR Reflectography for Non-destructive Analysis of Underdrawings in Art Objects |publisher=Sensors Unlimited, Inc. |accessdate=2009-02-20}}</ref> can be applied to paintings to reveal underlying layers in a completely non-destructive manner, in particular the [[underdrawing]] or outline drawn by the artist as a guide. This often reveals the artist's use of [[carbon black]], which shows up well in reflectograms, as long as it has not also been used in the ground underlying the whole painting. Art conservators are looking to see whether the visible layers of paint differ from the underdrawing or layers in between \u2013 such alterations are called [[pentimento|pentimenti]] when made by the original artist. This is very useful information in deciding whether a painting is the [[prime version]] by the original artist or a copy, and whether it has been altered by over-enthusiastic restoration work. In general, the more pentimenti the more likely a painting is to be the prime version. It also gives useful insights into working practices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandart.org/exhibcef/ConsExhib/html/grien.html |title=The Mass of Saint Gregory: Examining a Painting Using Infrared Reflectography |publisher=The Cleveland Museum of Art |accessdate=2009-02-20}}</ref>\n\nAmong many other changes in the [[Arnolfini Portrait]] of 1434 (left), the man's face was originally higher by about the height of his eye; the woman's was higher, and her eyes looked more to the front.

Herschel published his results in 1800 before the [[Royal Society of London]]. Herschel used a [[Triangular prism (optics)|prism]] to [[refract]] light from the [[sun]] and detected the infrared, beyond the [[red]] part of the spectrum, through an increase in the temperature recorded on a [[thermometer]]. He was surprised at the result and called them \"Calorific Rays\". The term 'Infrared' did not appear until late in the 19th century.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Herschel|first=William|title=Experiments on the Refrangibility of the Invisible Rays of the Sun|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|year=1800|volume=90|pages=284\u2013292|jstor=107057|doi=10.1098/rstl.1800.0015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/classroom_activities/herschel_bio.html |title=Herschel Discovers Infrared Light |work=Coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu  |accessdate=2011-11-08}}</ref>\n\nOther important dates include:<ref name=\"Miller\"/>\n[[File:William Herschel01.jpg|thumb|upright|Infrared radiation was discovered in 1800 by William Herschel.]]\n*1737: [[\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet]] predicted what is today known as infrared radiation in ''Dissertation sur la nature et la propagation du feu''.\n*1835: [[Macedonio Melloni]] made the first [[thermopile]] IR detector.\n*1840: [[John Herschel]] produces the first thermal image [[thermogram]].\n*1860: [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] formulated the [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation|blackbody theorem]] <math>E=J(T,n)</math>.\n*1873: [[Willoughby Smith]] discovered the photoconductivity of [[selenium]].\n*1879: [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]] formulated empirically that the power radiated by a blackbody is proportional to T<sup>4</sup>.\n*1880s & 1890s: [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] and [[Wilhelm Wien]] solved part of the blackbody equation, but both solutions diverged in parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.
