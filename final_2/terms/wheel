The wheel is one of the main components of the [[wheel and axle]] which is one of the [[Simple machine|six simple machines]]. Wheels, in conjunction with axles, allow heavy objects to be moved easily facilitating movement or transportation while supporting a load, or performing labor in machines. Wheels are also used for other purposes, such as a [[ship's wheel]], [[steering wheel]], [[potter's wheel]] and [[flywheel]].\n\nCommon examples are found in [[transport]] applications. A wheel greatly reduces [[friction]] by facilitating motion by [[rolling]] together with the use of [[axle]]s. In order for wheels to rotate, a [[Moment (physics)|moment]] needs to be applied to the wheel about its axis, either by way of gravity, or by the application of another external force or [[torque]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English word ''[[:wikt:wheel|wheel]]'' comes from the [[Old English]] word ''hweol, hweogol'', from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''{{lang|gem| *hwehwlan, *hwegwlan}}'', from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] {{lang|ine|*''k<sup>w</sup>ek<sup>w</sup>lo-''}},<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=wheel|encyclopedia=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=wheel}}</ref> an extended form of the root {{lang|ine|*''k<sup>w</sup>el-''}} \"to revolve, move around\".\nCognates within Indo-European include [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''hj\u00f3l'' \"wheel, tyre\", [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}} ''k\u00faklos'', and [[Sanskrit]] ''{{lang|sa|[[chakra]]}}'', the latter both meaning \"circle\" or \"wheel\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=wheel&submit.x=42&submit.y=19|title=American Heritage Dictionary Entry: wheel|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company}}</ref>\n<!--the root of \"rotation\" is not helpful and includes a commercial link---\nThe Latin word ''{{lang|la|[[:wikt:rota|rota]]}}'' is from the Proto-Indo-European {{lang|ine|*''rot\u0101-''}}, the extended o-grade form of the root {{lang|ine|*''ret-''}} meaning \"to roll, revolve\".<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE432.html ret- The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000] {{wayback|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE432.html |date=20061018073035 |df=y }}</ref>\n-->\n\n==History==\nThe invention of the wheel falls into the late [[Neolithic]], and may be seen in conjunction with other technological advances that gave rise to the early [[Bronze Age]].

The earliest known examples of wooden spoked wheels are in the context of the [[Andronovo culture]], dating to c. 2000 BCE. Soon after this, horse cultures of the [[Caucasus]] region used horse-drawn spoked-wheel war [[chariots]] for the greater part of three centuries.  They moved deep into the Greek peninsula where they joined with the existing Mediterranean peoples to give rise, eventually, to classical Greece after the breaking of [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] dominance and consolidations led by pre-classical [[Sparta]] and [[Athens]]. [[Celt]]ic chariots introduced an [[iron]] rim around the wheel in the 1st millennium BCE. The spoked wheel was in continued use without major modification until the 1870s, when wire wheels and pneumatic [[tire]]s were invented.<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/research/wheel-and-axle-woi/ bookrags.com] \u2013 Wheel and axle</ref>\n\nThe invention of the wheel has also been important for [[technology]] in general, important applications including the [[water wheel]], the [[cogwheel]] (see also [[antikythera mechanism]]), the [[spinning wheel]], and the [[astrolabe]] or [[torquetum]]. More modern descendants of the wheel include the [[propeller]], the [[jet engine]], the [[flywheel]] ([[gyroscope]]) and the [[turbine]].\n\n==Mechanics and function==\n{{main article|wheel and axle}}\n\nThe low resistance to motion (compared to dragging) is explained as follows (refer to [[friction]]):\n*the normal force at the sliding interface is the same.\n*the sliding distance is reduced for a given distance of travel.\n*the coefficient of friction at the interface is usually lower.\n\n[[bearing (mechanical)|Bearings]] are used to help reduce friction at the interface. In the simplest and oldest case the bearing is just a round hole through which the axle passes (a \"[[plain bearing]]\").\n\nExample:\n* If a 100 [[kilogram|kg]] object is dragged for 10 [[metre|m]] along a surface with the [[coefficient of friction]] ''\u03bc''&nbsp;= 0.5, the [[normal force]] is 981 [[Newton (unit)|N]] and the [[Mechanical work|work]] done (required [[energy]]) is (work=force x distance) 981 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 10&nbsp;= 4905 [[joule]]s.\n* Now give the object 4 wheels.  The normal force between the 4 wheels and axles is the same (in total) 981 N. Assume, for wood, ''\u03bc''&nbsp;= 0.25, and say the wheel [[diameter]] is 1000&nbsp;mm and axle diameter is 50&nbsp;mm.  So while the object still moves 10 m the sliding frictional surfaces only slide over each other a distance of 0.5 m.  The work done is 981 \u00d7 0.25 \u00d7 0.5&nbsp;= 123 joules; the work done has reduced to 1/40 of that of dragging.\n\nAdditional energy is lost from the wheel-to-road interface. This is termed [[rolling resistance]] which is predominantly a deformation loss. This energy is also lowered by the use of a wheel (in comparison to dragging) because the net force on the contact point between the road and the wheel is almost perpendicular to the ground, and hence, generates an almost zero net work. This depends on the nature of the ground, of the material of the wheel, its inflation in the case of a tire, the net torque exerted by the eventual engine, and many other factors.\n\nA wheel can also offer advantages in traversing irregular surfaces if the wheel radius is sufficiently large compared to the irregularities.\n\nThe wheel alone is not a machine, but when attached to an [[axle]] in conjunction with bearing, it forms the [[wheel and axle]], one of the [[simple machine]]s. A driven wheel is an example of a wheel and axle.  Note that wheels pre-date driven wheels by about 6000 years, themselves an evolution of using round logs as rollers to move a heavy load\u2014a practice going back in pre-history so far, it has not been dated.\n\n==Construction==\n\n=== Rim ===\n{{main article|Rim (wheel)}}\n[[File:AluminumWheel spoke design.jpg|right|thumb|An [[aluminium]] [[alloy wheel]]]]\nThe '''rim''' is the \"outer edge of a wheel, holding the tire.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUE0bazkcxAC&pg=PA722 |title=The Pocket Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus |first=Elizabeth |last=Jewel |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn= 978-0-19-530715-3 |page=722 |accessdate=2012-01-04 }}</ref> It makes up the outer circular design of the wheel on which the inside edge of the [[tire]] is mounted on vehicles such as [[automobile]]s. For example, on a [[bicycle wheel]] the [[rim (wheel)|rim]] is a large hoop attached to the outer ends of the spokes of the wheel that holds the tire and tube.\n\nIn the 1st millennium BCE an [[iron]] rim was introduced around the wooden wheels of [[chariot]]s.\n\n===Hub===\nThe hub is the center of the wheel, and typically houses a [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]], and is where the spokes meet.\n\nA [[hubless wheel]] (also known as a rim-rider or centerless wheel) is a type of wheel with no center [[wikt:hub|hub]]. More specifically, the hub is actually almost as big as the wheel itself. The [[axle]] is hollow, following the wheel at very close [[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]]s.\n\n=== Spokes ===\n{{main article|spoke}}\n[[File:Wheel Iran.jpg|thumb|A spoked wheel on display at The [[National Museum of Iran]], in [[Tehran]]. The wheel is dated to the late 2nd millennium BCE and was excavated at [[Choqa Zanbil]].]]\n\nA '''spoke''' is one of some number of rods radiating from the center of a wheel (the [[Bicycle hub|hub]] where the [[axle]] connects), connecting the hub with the round traction surface. The term originally referred to portions of a log which had been split lengthwise into four or six sections.  The radial members of a wagon wheel were made by carving a spoke (from a log) into their finished shape.  A [[spokeshave]] is a [[tool]] originally developed for this purpose. Eventually, the term spoke was more commonly applied to the finished product of the [[wheelwright]]'s work, than to the materials used.\n\n====Wire====\n{{main article|wire wheel}}\nThe [[Rim (wheel)|rims]] of '''wire wheels''' (or \"wire spoked wheels\") are connected to their hubs by wire [[spoke]]s. Although these [[wire]]s are generally stiffer than a typical [[wire rope]], they function mechanically the same as [[tension (physics)|tension]]ed flexible wires, keeping the rim true while supporting applied loads.\n\nWire wheels are used on most [[bicycle]]s and still used on many [[motorcycles]]. They were invented by aeronautical engineer [[George Cayley]] and first used in bicycles by [[James Starley]]. A process of assembling wire wheels is described as [[wheelbuilding]].\n[[Image:1957 MG A Roadster.jpg|right|thumb|A 1957 MGA automobile with wire wheels]]\n\n===Tire/Tyre===\n{{main article|tire}}\n[[File:Car tires.jpg|thumb|Stacked and standing car tires]]\n\nA '''tire''' (in [[American English]] and [[Canadian English]]) or '''tyre''' (in some [[English in the Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth Nations]] such as UK, India, South Africa and Australia) is a ring-shaped covering that fits around a wheel [[Rim (wheel)|rim]] to protect it and enable better vehicle performance by providing a flexible cushion that absorbs shock while keeping the wheel in close contact with the ground. The word itself may be derived from the word \"tie,\" which refers to the outer steel ring part of a wooden cart wheel that ties the wood segments together (see Etymology below).\n\nThe fundamental materials of modern tires are [[synthetic rubber]], [[natural rubber]], fabric and wire, along with other compound chemicals. They consist of a tread and a body. The tread provides [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] while the body ensures support. Before rubber was invented, the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal that fitted around wooden wheels to prevent wear and tear. Today, the vast majority of tires are [[pneumatic]] [[inflatable structure]]s, comprising a doughnut-shaped body of cords and wires encased in rubber and generally filled with compressed air to form an inflatable cushion. Pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles, such as [[cars]], [[bicycle]]s, [[motorcycles]], [[truck]]s, [[Heavy equipment (construction)|earthmover]]s, and [[aircraft]].\n\n===Trywheel===\nA trywheel is an arrangement of three wheels mounted on a y-shaped frame for the purpose of passing over stairs or rough ground. These may be driven by external force or integral motors.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Patent wheels==\nTo the 21st century observer, a wheel appears to be a fairly simple thing.

The wheel in ancient [[China]] is seen as a symbol of health and strength and utilized by some villages as a tool to predict future health and success. The [[diameter]] of the wheel is indicator of one's future health.\n\nThe winged wheel is a symbol of progress, seen in many contexts including the [[coat of arms of Panama]], the logo of the [[Ohio State Highway Patrol]] and the [[State Railway of Thailand]].\n\nThe introduction of spoked ([[chariot]]) wheels in the Middle Bronze Age appears to have carried somewhat of a prestige. The [[sun cross]] appears to have a significance in [[Bronze Age religion (disambiguation)|Bronze Age religion]], replacing the earlier concept of a [[Solar barge]] with the more \"modern\" and technologically advanced [[solar chariot]].\n\nThe wheel was also a solar symbol for the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Adelaide S.|title=A Glossary of Important Symbols in Their Hebrew: Pagan and Christian Forms|year=2005|isbn=9781596055933|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OxcOmjiAWXAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThe wheel is also the prominent figure on the [[flag of India]].
