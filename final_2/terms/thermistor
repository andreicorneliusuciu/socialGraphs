The word is a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[heat|thermal]]'' and ''[[resistor]]''. Thermistors are widely used as [[inrush current limiter]], temperature [[sensors]] (Negative Temperature Coefficient or '''NTC''' type typically), [[Resettable fuse|self-resetting overcurrent protectors]], and self-regulating [[heating element]]s. (Positive Temperature Coefficient or '''PTC''' type typically).\n\nThermistors are of two opposite fundamental types:\n*With '''NTC''', resistance '''''Decreases''''' as temperature rises to protect against inrush ''overvoltage'' conditions. Commonly installed '''series''' in a circuit.\n*With '''PTC''', resistance '''''Increases''''' as temperature rises to protect against ''overcurrent'' conditions. Commonly installed '''series''' in a circuit.\n\nThermistors differ from [[Resistance thermometer|resistance temperature detector]]s (RTDs) in that the material used in a thermistor is generally a ceramic or polymer, while RTDs use pure metals. The temperature response is also different; RTDs are useful over larger temperature ranges, while thermistors typically achieve a greater precision within a limited temperature range, typically \u221290&nbsp;\u00b0C to 130&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>[http://www.microchiptechno.com/ntc_thermistors.php \"NTC Thermistors\"]. Micro-chip Technologies. 2010.</ref>\n\n==Basic operation==\nAssuming, as a first-order approximation, that the relationship between resistance and temperature is [[linear]], then:\n:<math>\\Delta R = k\\Delta T \\,</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>\\Delta R</math>, change in resistance\n:<math>\\Delta T</math>, change in temperature\n:<math>k</math>, first-order [[Temperature coefficient|temperature coefficient of resistance]]\n\nThermistors can be classified into two types, depending on the classification of ''<math>k</math>''.  If ''<math>k</math>'' is [[Positive number|positive]], the resistance increases with increasing temperature, and the device is called a [[Temperature coefficient#Positive temperature coefficient of resistance|positive temperature coefficient]] ('''PTC''') thermistor, or '''posistor'''.  If ''<math>k</math>'' is negative, the resistance decreases with increasing temperature, and the device is called a [[Temperature coefficient#Negative temperature coefficient|negative temperature coefficient]] ('''NTC''') thermistor. Resistors that are not thermistors are designed to have a ''<math>k</math>''  as close to 0 as possible, so that their resistance remains nearly constant over a wide temperature range.\n\nInstead of the temperature coefficient ''k'', sometimes the ''temperature coefficient of resistance''  <math>\\alpha_T</math> (alpha sub T) is used. It is defined as<ref name=\"Thermistor Terminology\">[http://www.ussensor.com/terminology.html Thermistor Terminology]. U.S. Sensor</ref>\n:<math>\\alpha_T = \\frac{1}{R(T)} \\frac{dR}{dT}.</math>\nThis <math>\\alpha_T</math> coefficient should not be confused with the <math>a</math> parameter below.\n\n==Steinhart\u2013Hart equation==\n{{main article|Steinhart\u2013Hart equation}}\nIn practice, the linear approximation (above) works only over a small temperature range.  For accurate temperature measurements, the resistance/temperature curve of the device must be described in more detail. The [[Steinhart\u2013Hart equation]] is a widely used third-order approximation:\n:<math>{1 \\over T} = a + b\\,\\ln(R) + c\\,(\\ln(R))^3</math>\n\nwhere ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are called the Steinhart\u2013Hart parameters, and must be specified for each device. ''T'' is the [[absolute temperature]] and ''R'' is the resistance.  To give resistance as a function of temperature, the above can be rearranged into:\n:<math>R = \\mathrm{exp} \\left[{{\\left( x - {1 \\over 2}y \\right)}^{1 \\over 3} - {\\left( x + {1 \\over 2}y \\right)}^{1 \\over 3}}\\right]</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  y &= {1 \\over c}\\left(a - {1 \\over T}\\right) \\\\\n  x &= \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{b}{3c}\\right)^3 + \\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^2}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe error in the Steinhart\u2013Hart equation is generally less than 0.02&nbsp;\u00b0C in the measurement of temperature over a 200&nbsp;\u00b0C range.<ref>[http://cp.literature.agilent.com/litweb/pdf/5965-7822E.pdf \"Practical Temperature Measurements\"]. Agilent Application Note. Agilent Semiconductor.</ref> As an example, typical values for a thermistor with a resistance of 3&nbsp;k\u03a9 at room temperature (25&nbsp;\u00b0C = 298.15&nbsp;K) are:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  a &= 1.40 \\times 10^{-3} \\\\\n  b &= 2.37 \\times 10^{-4} \\\\\n  c &= 9.90 \\times 10^{-8}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==''B'' or ''\u03b2'' parameter equation==\nNTC thermistors can also be characterised with the ''B'' (or ''\u03b2'') parameter equation, which is essentially the [[Steinhart\u2013Hart equation]] with <math>a = (1/T_{0}) - (1/B) \\ln(R_{0})</math>, <math>b = 1/B</math> and <math>c = 0</math>,\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{T}=\\frac{1}{T_0} + \\frac{1}{B}\\ln \\left(\\frac{R}{R_0}\\right)</math>\n\nWhere the temperatures are in [[kelvin]] and ''R''<sub>0</sub> is the resistance at temperature ''T''<sub>0</sub> (25&nbsp;\u00b0C&nbsp;= 298.15&nbsp;K). Solving for ''R'' yields:\n\n:<math>R=R_0e^{-B\\left(\\frac{1}{T_0} - \\frac{1}{T}\\right)}</math>\n\nor, alternatively,\n\n:<math>R=r_\\infty e^{B/T}</math>\n\nwhere <math>r_\\infty=R_0 e^{-{B/T_0}}</math>.\n\nThis can be solved for the temperature:\n\n:<math>T={B\\over { {\\ln{(R / r_\\infty)}}}}</math>\n\nThe B-parameter equation can also be written as <math>\\ln R=B/T + \\ln r_\\infty</math>. This can be used to convert the function of resistance vs. temperature of a thermistor into a linear function of <math>\\ln R</math> vs. <math>1/T</math>. The average slope of this function will then yield an estimate of the value of the ''B'' parameter.\n\n==Conduction model==\n\n===NTC===\nMany NTC thermistors are made from a pressed disc, rod, plate, bead or [[casting|cast]] chip of [[semiconductor|semiconducting]] material such as [[sintering|sintered]] metal [[oxides]].  They work because raising the temperature of a semiconductor increases the number of active [[charge carrier]]s - it promotes them into the ''[[conduction band]]''. The more charge carriers that are available, the more [[current (electricity)|current]] a material can conduct. In certain materials like ferric oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) with titanium (Ti) doping an ''n-type'' semiconductor is formed and the charge carriers are [[electron]]s. In materials such as nickel oxide (NiO) with lithium (Li) doping a ''p-type'' semiconductor is created where [[Electron hole|holes]] are the charge carriers.<ref name=EERB>{{cite book|title=Electronics Engineer's Reference Book|year=1976|publisher=Butterworths|isbn=0408001682|pages=6-29 to 6-41|edition=4|editor=L. W  Turner}}</ref>\n\nThis is described in the formula:\n\n:<math>\nI = n \\cdot A \\cdot v \\cdot e\n</math>\n\n<math>I</math> = electric current (amperes)\n<br><math>n</math> = density of charge carriers (count/m\u00b3)\n<br><math>A</math> = cross-sectional area of the material (m\u00b2)\n<br><math>v</math> = drift velocity of electrons (m/s)\n<br><math>e</math> = charge of an electron (<math>e=1.602 \\times 10^{-19} </math> coulomb)\n\nOver large changes in temperature, calibration is necessary.  Over small changes in temperature, if the right semiconductor is used, the resistance of the material is linearly proportional to the temperature.  There are many different semiconducting thermistors with a range from about 0.01 [[kelvin]] to 2,000 kelvins (\u2212273.14&nbsp;\u00b0C to 1,700&nbsp;\u00b0C).{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===PTC===\nMost PTC thermistors are made from doped polycrystalline [[ceramic]] (containing [[barium titanate]] (BaTiO<sub>3</sub>) and other compounds) which have the property that their resistance rises suddenly at a certain critical temperature. Barium titanate is [[ferroelectric]] and its [[dielectric constant]] varies with temperature.  Below the [[Curie point]] temperature, the high [[dielectric constant]] prevents the formation of potential barriers between the crystal grains, leading to a low resistance.  In this region the device has a small negative temperature coefficient.  At the Curie point temperature, the dielectric constant drops sufficiently to allow the formation of potential barriers at the grain boundaries, and the resistance increases sharply with temperature.  At even higher temperatures, the material reverts to NTC behaviour.\n\nAnother type of thermistor is a '''silistor''', a thermally sensitive silicon resistor. Silistors employ silicon as the semiconductive component material. Unlike ceramic PTC thermistors, silistors have an almost linear resistance-temperature characteristic.<ref>[http://www.resistorguide.com/ptc-thermistor/ \"PTC Thermistors and Silistors\"] The Resistor Guide</ref>\n\nBarium titanate thermistors can be used as self-controlled heaters; for a given voltage, the ceramic will heat to a certain temperature, but the power used will depend on the heat loss from the ceramic.\n\nThe dynamics of PTC thermistors being powered also is extremely useful. When first connected to a voltage source, a large current corresponding to the low, cold, resistance flows, but as the thermistor self-heats, the current is reduced until a limiting current (and corresponding peak device temperature) is reached. The current-limiting effect can replace fuses. They are also used in the [[degaussing]] circuits of many CRT monitors and televisions where the degaussing coil only has to be connected in series with an appropriately chosen thermistor; a particular advantage is that the current decrease is smooth, producing optimum degausing effect. Improved degaussing circuits have auxiliary heating elements to heat the thermistor further (and reduce the final current) or timed relays to disconnect the degaussing circuit entirely after it has operated.\n\nAnother type of PTC thermistor is the [[polymer]] PTC, which is sold under brand names such as \"[[Polyswitch]]\" \"Semifuse\", and \"Multifuse\".  This consists of plastic with [[carbon]] grains embedded in it.  When the [[plastic]] is cool, the carbon grains are all in contact with each other, forming a [[electrical conductor|conductive]] path through the device.  When the plastic heats up, it expands, forcing the carbon grains apart, and causing the resistance of the device to rise, which then causes increased heating and rapid resistance increase.  Like the BaTiO<sub>3</sub> thermistor, this device has a highly nonlinear resistance/temperature response useful for thermal or circuit control, not for temperature measurement.  Besides circuit elements used to limit current, self-limiting heaters can be made in the form of wires or strips, useful for [[heat tracing]].  PTC thermistors 'latch' into a hot / low resistance state: once hot, they stay in that low resistance state, until cooled.  In fact, Neil A Downie showed how you can use the effect as a simple latch/memory circuit, the effect being enhanced by using two PTC thermistors in series, with thermistor A cool, thermistor B hot, or vice versa.<ref>Downie, Neil A, ''The Ultimate Book of Saturday Science'' (Princeton 2012) ISBN 0-691-14966-6</ref>\n\n==Self-heating effects==\nWhen a current flows through a thermistor, it will generate heat which will raise the temperature of the thermistor above that of its environment. If the thermistor is being used to measure the temperature of the environment, this electrical heating may introduce a significant error if a correction is not made. Alternatively, this effect itself can be exploited.  It can, for example, make a sensitive air-flow device employed in a [[sailplane]] rate-of-climb instrument, the electronic [[variometer]], or serve as a [[timer]] for a [[relay]] as was formerly done in [[telephone exchange]]s.\n\nThe electrical power input to the thermistor is just:\n\n:<math>P_E=IV\\,</math>\n\nwhere ''I'' is current and ''V'' is the voltage drop across the thermistor. This power is converted to heat, and this heat energy is transferred to the surrounding environment. The rate of transfer is well described by [[Newton's law of cooling]]:\n\n:<math>P_T=K(T(R)-T_0)\\,</math>\n\nwhere ''T(R)'' is the temperature of the thermistor as a function of its resistance ''R'', <math>T_0</math> is the temperature of the surroundings, and ''K'' is the '''dissipation constant''', usually expressed in units of milliwatts per degree Celsius. At equilibrium, the two rates must be equal.\n\n:<math>P_E=P_T\\,</math>\n\nThe current and voltage across the thermistor will depend on the particular circuit configuration. As a simple example, if the voltage across the thermistor is held fixed, then by [[Ohm's Law]] we have <math>I=V/R</math> and the equilibrium equation can be solved for the ambient temperature as a function of the measured resistance of the thermistor:\n\n:<math>T_0=T(R) -\\frac{V^2}{KR}\\,</math>\n\nThe dissipation constant is a measure of the thermal connection of the thermistor to its surroundings. It is generally given for the thermistor in still air, and in well-stirred oil. Typical values for a small glass bead thermistor are 1.5&nbsp;mW/\u00b0C in still air and 6.0&nbsp;mW/\u00b0C in stirred oil. If the temperature of the environment is known beforehand, then a thermistor may be used to measure the value of the dissipation constant. For example, the thermistor may be used as a flow rate sensor, since the dissipation constant increases with the rate of flow of a fluid past the thermistor.\n\nThe power dissipated in a thermistor is typically maintained at a very low level to ensure insignificant temperature measurement error due to self heating. However, some thermistor applications depend upon significant \"self heating\" to raise the body temperature of the thermistor well above the ambient temperature so the sensor then detects even subtle changes in the thermal conductivity of the environment. Some of these applications include liquid level detection, liquid flow measurement and air flow measurement.<ref name=\"Thermistor Terminology\"/>\n\n==Applications==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2013}}\n\n===PTC===\n* As current-limiting devices for circuit protection, as replacements for fuses. Current through the device causes a small amount of resistive heating. If the current is large enough to generate more heat than the device can lose to its surroundings, the device heats up, causing its resistance to increase. This creates a self-reinforcing effect that drives the resistance upwards, therefore limiting the current.\n* As timers in the [[degauss|degaussing coil]] circuit of most CRT displays.  When the display unit is initially switched on, current flows through the thermistor and degaussing coil.  The coil and thermistor are intentionally sized so that the current flow will heat the thermistor to the point that the degaussing coil shuts off in under a second.  For effective degaussing, it is necessary that the magnitude of the alternating magnetic field produced by the degaussing coil decreases smoothly and continuously, rather than sharply switching off or decreasing in steps; the PTC thermistor accomplishes this naturally as it heats up.  A degaussing circuit using a PTC thermistor is simple, reliable (for its simplicity), and inexpensive.\n* As heater in automotive industry to provide additional heat inside cabin with diesel engine or to heat diesel in cold climatic conditions before engine injection.\n* In temperature compensated [[synthesizer]] voltage controlled oscillators.<ref>[http://www.oldcrows.net/~patchell/synthmodules/vco.html Temperature Compensated VCO]</ref>\n* In [[lithium battery]] protection circuits.<ref>Patent CN 1273423A (China)</ref>\n* In an electrically actuated [[Wax motor]] to provide the heat necessary to expand the wax.\n\n===NTC===\n* As a [[resistance thermometer]] for low-temperature measurements of the order of 10&nbsp;K.\n* As an [[inrush current limiter]] device in power supply circuits, they present a higher resistance initially, which prevents large currents from flowing at turn-on, and then heat up and become much lower resistance to allow higher current flow during normal operation.
