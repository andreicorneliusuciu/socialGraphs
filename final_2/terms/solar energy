However, the use of [[photovoltaics]] that can follow the position of the sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator.<ref name=\"World Energy Assessment\"/> Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation on the surface of the Earth for [[solar panels]] to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. [[Cloud cover]] can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.\n\nIn addition, land availability has a large effect on the available solar energy because solar panels can only be set up on land that is otherwise unused and suitable for solar panels. Roofs have been found to be a suitable place for solar cells, as many people have discovered that they can collect energy directly from their homes this way. Other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses where solar plants can be established.<ref name=\"World Energy Assessment\"/>\n\nSolar technologies are characterized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world, mostly depending on distance from the equator. Although solar energy refers primarily to the use of solar radiation for practical ends, all renewable energies, other than [[Geothermal power]] and [[Tidal power]], derive their energy either directly or indirectly from the Sun.\n\nActive solar techniques use photovoltaics, [[concentrated solar power]], [[solar thermal collector]]s, pumps, and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs. Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing the position of a building to the Sun. Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered [[supply side]] technologies, while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand side technologies.<ref name=\"IEA Solar Thermal\"/>\n\nIn 2000, the [[United Nations Development Programme]], UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, and [[World Energy Council]] published an estimate of the potential solar energy that could be used by humans each year that took into account factors such as insolation, cloud cover, and the land that is usable by humans.

Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment.<ref>Mazria (1979), pp. 29\u201335</ref>\n\nA solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is a passive solar ventilation system composed of a vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building.

The [[Andasol solar power station|Andasol]] CSP plant uses tanks of molten salt to store solar energy.]]\n[[Thermal mass]] systems can store solar energy in the form of heat at domestically useful temperatures for daily or [[seasonal thermal energy storage|interseasonal durations]]. Thermal storage systems generally use readily available materials with high [[specific heat]] capacities such as water, earth and stone. Well-designed systems can lower [[peak demand]], shift time-of-use to [[wikt:off-peak|off-peak]] hours and reduce overall heating and cooling requirements.<ref>Balcomb(1992), p. 6</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Request for Participation Summer 2005 Demand Shifting with Thermal Mass|publisher=Demand Response Research Center|url=http://www.drrc.lbl.gov/pubs/RFP_071405.pdf|accessdate=26 November 2007|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nPhase change materials such as [[paraffin wax]] and [[Sodium sulfate#Thermal storage|Glauber's salt]] are another thermal storage medium. These materials are inexpensive, readily available, and can deliver domestically useful temperatures (approximately {{convert|64|C|disp=or}}). The \"Dover House\" (in [[Dover, Massachusetts]]) was the first to use a Glauber's salt heating system, in 1948.<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), pp. 212\u2013214</ref> Solar energy can also be stored at high temperatures using [[molten salt]]s. Salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. The [[The Solar Project#Solar Two|Solar Two]] project used this method of energy storage, allowing it to store {{convert|1.44|TJ|lk=in}} in its 68 m\u00b3 storage tank with an annual storage efficiency of about 99%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Advantages of Using Molten Salt|publisher=Sandia National Laboratory|url=http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/solarthermal/NSTTF/salt.htm|accessdate=29 September 2007}}</ref>\n\nOff-grid [[Photovoltaics|PV systems]] have traditionally used [[rechargeable batteries]] to store excess electricity. With grid-tied systems, excess electricity can be sent to the transmission [[Grid-tied electrical system|grid]], while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. [[Net metering]] programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour credit to the next month.<ref>{{cite web|title=PV Systems and Net Metering|publisher=Department of Energy|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/net_metering.html|accessdate=31 July 2008|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080704062311/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/net_metering.html|archivedate=4 July 2008}}</ref> Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary.\n\n[[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] stores energy in the form of water pumped when energy is available from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one.

The early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce. However, development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20th&nbsp;century in the face of the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and [[petroleum]].<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), pp. 63, 77, 101</ref>\n\nThe [[1973 oil crisis|1973 oil embargo]] and [[1979 energy crisis]] caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies.<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 249</ref><ref>Yergin (1991), pp. 634, 653-673</ref> Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the U.S. and the Sunshine Program in Japan.
