Tsien]], is a field of [[cybernetics]], which deals with the question of [[control engineering]] of [[mechatronic]] systems as well as chemical or [[biological systems]]. It is used to control and predict the behaviour of such a system; see [[control theory]].\n\nAn example of engineering cybernetics is a device designed in the mid-1960s by [[General Electric Company]]. Referred to as a CAM ([[cybernetic anthropomorphous machine]]), this [[machine]] was designed for use by the [[US Army]] ground troops. Operated by one man in a \"cockpit\" at the front end, the machine's \"legs\" steps were duplicates of the leg movements of the harnessed operator.\n\n== External links==\n* [http://www.techkyb.de/ Information on the program of study \"Engineering Cybernetics\" at the University of Stuttgart]\n* [http://www.kybernetik.ovgu.de/ Information on the program of study \"Technical Cybernetics\" at the University of Magdeburg]\n* [http://www.itk.ntnu.no/ Department of Engineering Cybernetics at the Norwegian University of Science and technology]\n[[Category:Cybernetics]]\n\n{{robo-stub}}\n{{engineering-stub}}"}]}}}}
