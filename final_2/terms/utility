The concept is an important underpinning of [[rational choice theory]] in economics and [[game theory]]: since one cannot directly measure benefit, satisfaction or [[happiness]] from a good or service, economists instead have devised ways of representing and measuring utility in terms of measurable economic choices. Economists have attempted to perfect highly abstract methods of comparing utilities by observing and calculating economic choices; in the simplest sense, economists consider utility to be revealed in people's willingness to pay different amounts for different goods.\n\n==Applications==\n\nUtility is usually applied by [[economist]]s in such constructs as the [[indifference curve]], which plot the combination of commodities that an individual or a society would accept to maintain a given level of satisfaction. Utility and indifference curves are used by economists to understand the underpinnings of [[demand curve]]s, which are half of the [[supply and demand]] analysis that is used to analyze the workings of [[good (economics)|goods]] markets.\n\nIndividual utility and social utility can be construed as the value of a utility function and a [[social welfare function]] respectively.  When coupled with production or commodity constraints, under some assumptions these functions can be used to analyze [[Pareto efficiency]], such as illustrated by [[Edgeworth box]]es in [[contract curve]]s. Such efficiency is a central concept in [[welfare economics]].\n\nIn [[finance]], utility is applied to generate an individual's price for an [[asset]] called the [[indifference price]].  Utility functions are also related to [[risk measure]]s, with the most common example being the [[entropic risk measure]].\n\n==Revealed preference==\nIt was recognized that utility could not be measured or observed directly, so instead economists devised a way to infer underlying relative utilities from observed choice. These 'revealed preferences', as they were named by [[Paul Samuelson]], were revealed e.g. in people's willingness to pay: <blockquote>Utility is taken to be correlative to Desire or Want. It has been already argued that desires cannot be measured directly, but only indirectly, by the outward phenomena to which they give rise: and that in those cases with which economics is chiefly concerned the measure is found in the price which a person is willing to pay for the fulfillment or satisfaction of his desire.<ref>{{cite book |first=Alfred |last=Marshall |year=1920 |title=Principles of Economics. An introductory volume |edition=8th |location=London |publisher=Macmillan }}</ref>{{RP|78}}</blockquote>\n\n=={{Visible anchor|Functions|Utility functions}}==\n\nThere has been some controversy over the question whether the utility of a [[commodity]] can be measured or not. At one time, it was assumed that the consumer was able to say exactly how much utility he got from the commodity. The economists who made this assumption belonged to the 'cardinalist school' of economics. Today '''utility functions''', expressing utility as a function of the amounts of the various goods consumed, are treated as either ''cardinal'' or ''ordinal'', depending on whether they are or are not interpreted as providing more information than simply the rank ordering of preferences over bundles of goods, such as information on the strength of preferences.\n\n===Cardinal===\n{{Main|Cardinal utility}}\n\nWhen cardinal utility is used, the magnitude of utility differences is treated as an ethically or behaviorally significant quantity. For example, suppose a cup of orange juice has utility of 120 utils, a cup of tea has a utility of 80 utils, and a cup of water has a utility of 40 utils. With cardinal utility, it can be concluded that the cup of orange juice is better than the cup of tea by exactly the same amount by which the cup of tea is better than the cup of water. One cannot conclude, however, that the cup of tea is two thirds as good as the cup of juice, because this conclusion would depend not only on magnitudes of utility differences, but also on the \"zero\" of utility. For example, if the \"zero\" of utility was located at -40, then a cup of orange juice would be 160 utils more than zero, a cup of tea 120 utils more than zero.\n\n[[Neoclassical economics]] has largely retreated from using cardinal utility functions as the basis of economic behavior. A notable exception is in the context of analyzing choice under conditions of risk (see [[#Expected utility|below]]).\n\nSometimes cardinal utility is used to aggregate utilities across persons, to create a [[social welfare function]]. The argument against this is that interpersonal comparisons of utility are meaningless because there is no simple way to interpret how different people value consumption bundles.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n===Ordinal===\n{{Main|Ordinal utility}}\n\nWhen ordinal utilities are used, differences in utils (values taken on by the utility function) are treated as ethically or behaviorally meaningless:  the utility index encodes a full behavioral ordering between members of a choice set, but tells nothing about the related ''strength of preferences''. In the above example, it would only be possible to say that juice is preferred to tea to water, but no more.\n\nOrdinal utility functions are unique [[up to]] increasing monotone transformations. For example, if a function <math>u(x)</math> is taken as ordinal, it is equivalent to the function <math>u(x)^3</math>, because taking the 3rd power is an increasing [[monotone transformation]]. This means that the ordinal preference induced by these functions is the same.  In contrast,  cardinal utilities are unique only up to increasing linear transformations, so if <math>u(x)</math> is taken as cardinal, it is not equivalent to <math>u(x)^3</math>.\n\n===Preferences===\n\nAlthough [[preference]]s are the conventional foundation of [[microeconomics]], it is often convenient to represent preferences with a utility [[Function (mathematics)|function]] and analyze human behavior indirectly with utility functions.  Let ''X'' be the '''consumption set''', the set of all mutually-exclusive baskets the consumer could conceivably consume.  The consumer's '''utility function''' <math> u\\colon X\\to \\R</math> ranks each package in the consumption set.  If the consumer strictly prefers ''x'' to ''y'' or is indifferent between them, then <math>u(x)\\geq u(y)</math>.\n\nFor example, suppose a consumer's consumption set is ''X'' =&nbsp;{nothing, 1&nbsp;apple,1&nbsp;orange, 1&nbsp;apple and 1&nbsp;orange, 2&nbsp;apples, 2&nbsp;oranges}, and its utility function is ''u''(nothing)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, ''u''(1&nbsp;apple)&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, ''u''(1&nbsp;orange)&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, ''u''(1&nbsp;apple and 1&nbsp;orange)&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, ''u''(2&nbsp;apples)&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 and ''u''(2&nbsp;oranges)&nbsp;=&nbsp;3.  Then this consumer prefers 1 orange to 1 apple, but prefers one of each to 2 oranges.\n\nIn micro-economic models, there are usually a finite set of L commodities, and a consumer may consume an arbitrary amount of each commodity.  This gives a consumption set of <math>\\R^L_+</math>, and each package <math>x \\in \\R^L_+</math> is a vector containing the amounts of each commodity.  In the previous example, we might say there are two commodities: apples and oranges.  If we say apples is the first commodity, and oranges the second, then the consumption set <math>X =\\R^2_+</math> and ''u''(0,&nbsp;0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, ''u''(1,&nbsp;0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, ''u''(0,&nbsp;1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, ''u''(1,&nbsp;1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, ''u''(2,&nbsp;0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, ''u''(0,&nbsp;2)&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 as before.  Note that for ''u'' to be a utility function on&nbsp;''X'', it must be defined for every package in&nbsp;''X''.\n\nA utility function <math> u\\colon X\\to \\R</math> '''represents''' a preference relation <math>\\preceq</math> on X [[if and only if|iff]] for every <math>x, y \\in X</math>, <math>u(x)\\leq u(y)</math> implies <math>x\\preceq  y</math>.  If u represents <math>\\preceq</math>, then this implies <math>\\preceq</math> is complete and transitive, and hence rational.\n\n===Examples===\n\nIn order to simplify calculations, various alternative assumptions have been made concerning details of human preferences, and these imply various alternative utility functions such as:\n\n* [[constant elasticity of substitution|CES]] (''constant elasticity of substitution'', or ''[[isoelastic utility|isoelastic]]'') utility\n* [[Isoelastic utility]]\n* [[Exponential utility]]\n* [[Quasilinear utility]]\n* [[Homothetic preferences]]\n* [[Uzawa utility function]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Blanchard |first=Olivier J. |last2=Fischer |first2=Stanley |chapter=Dependence of the Discount Rate on Utility |title=Lectures on Macroeconomics |location=Cambridge |publisher=MIT Press |year=1989 |isbn=0-262-02283-4 |pages=72\u201375 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=j_zs7htz9moC&pg=PA72 }}</ref>\n* [[Stone\u2013Geary utility function]]\n* [[Gorman polar form]]\n** [[Greenwood\u2013Hercowitz\u2013Huffman preferences]]\n** [[King\u2013Plosser\u2013Rebelo preferences]]\n* [[Hyperbolic absolute risk aversion]]\n\nMost utility functions used in modeling or theory are '''well-behaved.''' They are usually monotonic and quasi-concave. However, it is possible for preferences not to be representable by a utility function. An example is [[lexicographic preferences]] which are not continuous and cannot be represented by a continuous utility function.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jonathan E., Jr. |last=Ingersoll |title=Theory of Financial Decision Making |location=Totowa |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield |year=1987 |page=21 |isbn=0-8476-7359-6 }}</ref>\n\n==Expected==\n{{Main|Expected utility hypothesis}}\n\nThe expected utility theory deals with the analysis of choices among '''risky''' projects with (possibly multidimensional) outcomes.\n\nThe [[St. Petersburg paradox]] was first proposed by [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli|Nicholas Bernoulli]] in 1713 and solved by [[Daniel Bernoulli]] in 1738. D. Bernoulli argued that the paradox could be resolved if decision-makers displayed [[risk aversion]] and argued for a logarithmic cardinal utility function.\n\nThe first important use of the expected utility theory was that of [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]], who used the assumption of expected utility maximization in their formulation of [[game theory]].\n\n===von Neumann\u2013Morgenstern===\n{{Main|Von Neumann\u2013Morgenstern utility theorem}}\n\nVon Neumann and Morgenstern addressed situations in which the outcomes of choices are not known with certainty, but have probabilities attached to them.\n\nA notation for a ''[[Lottery (probability)|lottery]]'' is as follows: if options A and B have probability ''p'' and 1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''p'' in the lottery, we write it as a linear combination:\n:<math>\nL = p A + (1-p) B\n</math>\n\nMore generally, for a lottery with many possible options:\n\n:<math>\nL = \\sum_i p_i A_i,\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\sum_i p_i =1</math>.\n\nBy making some reasonable assumptions about the way choices behave, von Neumann and Morgenstern showed that if an agent can choose between the lotteries, then this agent has a utility function such that the desirability of an arbitrary lottery can be calculated as a linear combination of the utilities of its parts, with the weights being their probabilities of occurring.\n\nThis is called the ''expected utility theorem''. The required assumptions are four axioms about the properties of the agent's [[preference relation]] over 'simple lotteries', which are lotteries with just two options. Writing <math>B\\preceq A</math> to mean 'A is weakly preferred to B' ('A is preferred at least as much as B'), the axioms are:\n\n# completeness: For any two simple lotteries <math>L</math> and <math>M</math>, either <math>L\\preceq M</math> or <math>M\\preceq L</math> (or both, in which case they are viewed as equally desirable).\n# transitivity: for any three lotteries <math>L,M,N</math>, if <math>L\\preceq M</math> and <math>M\\preceq N</math>, then <math>L\\preceq N</math>.\n# convexity/continuity (Archimedean property): If <math>L \\preceq M\\preceq N</math>, then there is a <math>p</math> between 0 and 1 such that the lottery <math>pL + (1-p)N</math> is equally desirable as <math>M</math>.\n# independence: for any three lotteries <math>L,M,N</math> and any probability ''p'', <math>L \\preceq M</math> if and only if <math>pL+(1-p)N \\preceq pM+(1-p)N</math>. Intuitively, if the lottery formed by the probabilistic combination of <math>L</math> and <math>N</math> is no more preferable than the lottery formed by the same probabilistic combination of <math>M</math> and <math>N,</math> then and only then <math>L \\preceq M</math>.\n\nAxioms 3 and 4 enable us to decide about the relative utilities of two assets or lotteries.\n\nIn more formal language: A von Neumann\u2013Morgenstern utility function is a function from choices to the real numbers:\n:<math> u\\colon X\\to \\R</math>\nwhich assigns a real number to every outcome in a way that captures the agent's preferences over simple lotteries. Under the four assumptions mentioned above, the agent will prefer a lottery <math>L_2</math> to a lottery <math>L_1</math> if and only if, for the utility function characterizing that agent, the expected utility of <math>L_2</math> is greater than the expected utility of <math>L_1</math>:\n:<math>L_1\\preceq L_2 \\text{ iff } u(L_1)\\leq u(L_2)</math>.\n\nRepeating in category language: <math>u</math> is a morphism between the category of preferences with uncertainty and the category of reals as an additive group.\n\nOf all the axioms, independence is the most often discarded. A variety of [[generalized expected utility]] theories have arisen, most of which drop or relax the independence axiom.\n\n===As probability of success===\nCastagnoli and LiCalzi and Bordley and LiCalzi (2000) provided another interpretation for Von Neumann and Morgenstern's theory.  Specifically for any utility function, there exists a hypothetical reference lottery with the expected utility of an arbitrary lottery being its probability of performing no worse than the reference lottery. Suppose success is defined as getting an outcome no worse than the outcome of the reference lottery.  Then this mathematical equivalence means that maximizing expected utility is equivalent to maximizing the probability of success. In many contexts, this makes the concept of utility easier to justify and to apply. For example, a firm's utility might be the probability of meeting uncertain future customer expectations.\n<ref>Castagnoli, E. and M.

The (indirect) utility function for money is a nonlinear function that is [[bounded function|bounded]] and asymmetric about the origin. The utility function is [[concave function|concave]] in the positive region, reflecting the phenomenon of [[diminishing marginal utility]].  The boundedness reflects the fact that beyond a certain point money ceases being useful at all, as the size of any economy at any point in time is itself bounded.  The asymmetry about the origin reflects the fact that gaining and losing money can have radically different implications both for individuals and businesses.  The non-linearity of the utility function for money has profound implications in decision making processes: in situations where outcomes of choices influence utility through gains or losses of money, which are the norm in most business settings, the optimal choice for a given decision depends on the possible outcomes of all other decisions in the same time-period.<ref>{{cite book |first=J.

This is so because if we take changes in peoples' behavior in relation to a change in prices or a change in the underlying budget constraint we can never be sure to what extent the change in behavior was due to the change in price or budget constraint and how much was due to a change in preferences.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pilkington |first=Philip |title=Joan Robinson\u2019s Critique of Marginal Utility Theory |work=Fixing the Economists |date=17 February 2014 |url=https://fixingtheeconomists.wordpress.com/2014/02/17/joan-robinsons-critique-of-marginal-utility-theory/ }}</ref> This criticism is similar to that of the philosopher [[Hans Albert]] who argued that the ceteris paribus conditions on which the marginalist theory of demand rested rendered the theory itself an empty tautology and completely closed to experimental testing.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pilkington |first=Philip |title=utility Hans Albert Expands Robinson\u2019s Critique of Marginal Utility Theory to the Law of Demand |work=Fixing the Economists |date=27 February 2014 |url=https://fixingtheeconomists.wordpress.com/2014/02/27/hans-albert-expands-robinsons-critique-of-marginal-utility-theory-to-the-law-of-demand/ }}</ref> In essence, demand and supply curve (theoretical line of quantity of a product which would have been offered or requested for given price) is purely ontological and could never been demonstrated empirically.\n\nAnother criticism comes from the assertion that neither cardinal nor ordinal utility is empirically observable in the real world. In the case of cardinal utility it is impossible to measure the level of satisfaction \"quantitatively\" when someone consumes or purchases an apple. In case of ordinal utility, it is impossible to determine what choices were made when someone purchases, for example, an orange. Any act would involve preference over a vast [[set (mathematics)|set]] of choices (such as apple, orange juice, other vegetable, vitamin C tablets, exercise, not purchasing, etc.).<ref>{{Way-back |date=20110716090409 |url=http://www.societies.cam.ac.uk/cujif/ABSTRACT/980606.htm|lang_ja&client=firefox-a |title= }}</ref><ref>http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~botond/mistakeschicago.pdf</ref>\n\nOther questions of what arguments ought to enter into a utility function are difficult to answer, yet seem necessary to understanding utility.
