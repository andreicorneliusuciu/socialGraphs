The lamp typically consists of a small glass capsule that contains a mixture of [[neon]] and [[Penning mixture|other gases]] at a low pressure and two [[electrode]]s (an [[anode]] and a [[cathode]]).  When sufficient voltage is applied and sufficient current is supplied between the electrodes, the lamp produces an orange [[glow discharge]].  The glowing portion in the lamp is a thin region near the cathode; the larger and much longer [[neon sign]]s are also glow discharges, but they use the [[wikt:positive column|positive column]] which is not present in the ordinary neon lamp.  Neon glow lamps are widely used as [[indicator lamp]]s in the displays of electronic instruments and appliances.\n\n==History==\n[[Neon]] was discovered in 1898 by [[William Ramsay]] and [[Morris W. Travers]]. The characteristic, brilliant red color that is emitted by gaseous neon when excited electrically was noted immediately; Travers later wrote, \"the blaze of crimson light from the tube told its own story and was a sight to dwell upon and never forget.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Discovery of the Elements: Third Edition (reprint) |last=Weeks |first=Mary Elvira |authorlink=Mary Elvira Weeks|year=2003 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJIk9BPdNWcC&pg=PA287 |page=287 }}<!--The probable original source for this quote is Travers' 1928 book: {{cite book |title=The Discovery of the Rare Gases |last=Travers |first=Morris W. |publisher=Edward Arnold & Co. |location=London |year=1928}}--></ref>\n\nNeon's scarcity precluded its prompt application for electrical lighting along the lines of [[Moore tube]]s, which used electric discharges in nitrogen. Moore tubes were commercialized by their inventor, [[Daniel McFarlan Moore]], in the early 1900s. After 1902, [[Georges Claude]]'s company, [[Air Liquide]], was producing industrial quantities of neon as a byproduct of his air liquefaction business, and in December 1910 Claude demonstrated modern [[neon light]]ing based on a sealed tube of neon. In 1915 a U.S. patent was issued to Claude covering the design of the electrodes for neon tube lights;<ref>{{cite patent |country=US |number=1125476 |title=Systems of Illuminating by Luminescent Tubes |invent1=Georges Claude |gdate=1915-01-19 |fdate=1911-11-09}}</ref> this patent became the basis for the monopoly held in the U.S. by his company, Claude Neon Lights, through the early 1930s.<ref>{{cite news |title=Claude Neon Lights Wins Injunction Suit: Also Gets Rights to Recover Profits and Damages Resulting From Patent Infringement |work=The New York Times |date=November 28, 1928}} Paid access.</ref>\n\n[[Image:NE-34 LAMP.JPG|thumb|right|A [[General Electric]] NE-34 glow lamp, manufactured circa 1930]]\nAround 1917, Daniel Moore developed the neon lamp while working at the [[General Electric Company]]. The lamp has a very different design from the much larger neon tubes used for [[neon lighting]]. The difference in design was sufficient that a U.S. patent was issued for the lamp in 1919.<ref>{{ref patent| country=US |number=1316967 |status=patent |title=Gaseous Conduction Lamp |pubdate= |gdate=1919-09-23 |fdate=1917-11-30 |pridate= |invent1=Daniel McFarlan Moore |invent2= |assign1=General Electric Company |assign2= |class= }}</ref> A Smithsonian Institution website notes, \"These small, low power devices use a physical principle called [[coronal discharge]]. Moore mounted two electrodes close together in a bulb and added neon or argon gas. The electrodes would glow brightly in red or blue, depending on the gas, and the lamps lasted for years. Since the electrodes could take almost any shape imaginable, a popular application has been fanciful decorative lamps. Glow lamps found practical use as indicators in instrument panels and in many home appliances until the widespread commercialisation of Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) in the 1970s.\"<ref name=SI>{{cite web |title=Lamp Inventors 1880-1940: Moore Lamp |publisher=The Smithsonian Institution |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/lighting/bios/moore.htm}}</ref><!--There is a long history for these lamps that needs to be developed here.

Dougherty, T.D. Foulke, J.D. Harden, T.L. Hewitt, F.N. Peters, R.D. Smith, and J.W. Tuttle, ''General Electric Glow Lamp Manual'', 2nd ed. (General Electric Company, 1966), Chapter 1:  Physics and characteristics of glow lamps:  Theory of gaseous conduction in the glow lamp, pages 1-3; see Fig. 1.1, Characteristic curve of the neon lamp.  In the current vs. voltage curve in this article, the portion of the curve between points A and B correspond to the points E and F in Fig. 1.1.  From p. 2:  \"After breakdown occurs the lamp passes through a transition region EF which is an unstable region of operation.  The shaded portion indicates the region in which oscillation can occur.  This region is often referred to as the ''negative resistance region'', since voltage decreases as current increase[s], contrary to normal behavior in a resistive element. [...] As the current through the lamp is allowed to increase further, the lamp enters the ''normal glow'' discharge region represented by section FG [where the point G corresponds to the point C in the current vs. voltage graph of this article] in Fig. 1.1 where voltage changes a minimum amount with a change in current. \u2026 In the normal glow region the glow is confined to a portion of the cathode surface and the amount of cathode surface covered by the glow is somewhat proportional to the tube current.\"</ref> |alt=Graph.]]\nA small [[electric current]] (for a 5&nbsp;mm bulb diameter NE-2 lamp, the quiescent current is about 400 \u00b5A), which may be [[alternating current|AC]] or [[direct current|DC]], is allowed through the tube, causing it to glow orange-red.  The gas is typically a [[Penning mixture]], 99.5% [[neon]] and 0.5% [[argon]], which has lower [[Breakdown voltage#Gases and vacuum|striking voltage]] than pure neon, at a pressure of 1-20 [[torr]].  The lamp [[glow discharge]] lights at its striking voltage. The voltage required to sustain the discharge is significantly (~30%) lower than the striking voltage. This is due to the organization of positive ions near the cathode.  Neon lamps operate using a low current [[glow discharge]]. Higher power devices, such as [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s or [[metal halide lamp]]s use a higher current [[arc discharge]]. Low pressure [[sodium-vapor lamp]]s use a neon Penning mixture for warm up and can be operated as giant neon lamps if operated in a low power mode.\n\nOnce the neon lamp has reached breakdown, it can support a large current flow. Because of this characteristic, electrical circuitry external to the neon lamp must limit the current through the circuit or else the current will rapidly increase until the lamp is destroyed. For indicator-sized lamps, a [[resistor]] typically limits the current. In contrast, larger sized lamps often use a specially constructed high voltage [[transformer]] with high [[leakage inductance]] or other [[electrical ballast]] to limit the available current (see [[neon sign]]).\n\nWhen the current through the lamp is lower than the current for the highest-current discharge path, the [[glow discharge]] may become unstable and not cover the entire surface of the electrodes.<ref name = \"Glow Lamp Manual\"/> This may be a sign of aging of the indicator bulb, and is exploited in the decorative \"flicker flame\" neon lamps. However, while too low a current causes flickering, too high a current increases the wear of the electrodes by stimulating [[sputtering]], which coats the internal surface of the lamp with metal and causes it to darken.\n\nThe potential needed to strike the discharge is higher than what is needed to sustain the discharge. When there is not enough current, the glow forms around only part of the electrode surface. Convective currents make the glowing areas flow upwards, not unlike the discharge in a [[Spark gap#Spark gaps as entertainment|Jacob's ladder]]. A [[photoionization]] effect can also be observed here, as the electrode area covered by the glow discharge can be increased by shining light at the lamp.\n\nIn comparison with [[incandescent lamp|incandescent light bulbs]], neon lamps have much higher [[luminous efficacy]]. [[Incandescence]] is heat-driven light emission, so a large portion of the electric energy put into an incandescent bulb is converted into heat. Non-incandescent light sources such as neon light bulbs, [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent light bulbs]], and [[light emitting diodes]] are therefore much more energy efficient than normal incandescent light bulbs. [[Green]] neon bulbs<ref>\"Other emitted colors such as green, yellow and blue are available through secondary emission by coating the inside surface of the envelope with phosphor.\" \u2014 [http://www.intl-lighttech.com/products/light-sources/lamps/neon International Light Technology]</ref> can produce up to 65 lumens per watt of power input, while white neon bulbs have an efficacy of around 50 lumens per watt. In contrast, a standard incandescent light bulb only produces around 13.5 lumens per watt.<ref>{{cite web|first=Marcus|last=Thielen|title=LED or Neon|url=http://www.signweb.com/index.php/channel/12/id/138/|date=2006-02-10|accessdate=2008-12-30}}</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\n[[Image:Socket 5.jpg|thumb|150px|Switch on a power strip, illuminated by a neon lamp]]\n\n=== Indicator ===\nSmall neon lamps are most widely used as indicators in electronic equipment and appliances, due to their low power consumption, long life, and ability to operate on mains power. \n\n=== Voltage tester ===\n[[Image:Neonlamp3.JPG|right|thumb|250px|+DC (left), -DC (center), AC (right) supplied to NE-2 type neon lamps|alt=Photograph of 3 small glass capsules.

In the right capsule, both electrodes are glowing.]]\n\nMost small neon (indicator-sized) lamps, such as the common '''NE-2''', have a [[Breakdown voltage#Gases and vacuum|break-down voltage]] of around 90&nbsp;[[volt]]s.  When driven from a DC source, only the negatively charged electrode ([[cathode]]) will glow. When driven from an AC source, both electrodes will glow (each during alternate half cycles). These attributes make neon bulbs (with series resistors) a convenient low-cost [[Test light|voltage tester]].  By examining which electrode is glowing they can reveal whether a given voltage source is AC or DC, and if DC, the polarity of the points being tested.\n\n=== Voltage regulation ===\nThe breakdown feature of neon lamps allows them to be used as very simple [[voltage regulator]]s or [[overvoltage]] protection devices.

These were sometimes called \"circuit-component\" lamps, the other variety being indicators. A variant of the NE-2 type lamp, the NE-77, had three parallel wires (in a plane) instead of the usual two. It was also intended primarily to be a circuit component.\n\n=== Detector ===\nNeon lamps have been historically used as microwave and millimeter-wave detectors ('plasma diodes' or GDDs- Glow Discharge Detectors) up to about 100&nbsp;GHz or so and in such service were said to exhibit comparable sensitivity (of the order of a few 10s to perhaps 100 microvolts) to the familiar 1N23-type catwhisker-contacted silicon diodes once ubiquitous in microwave equipment. More recently it has been found that these lamps work well as detectors even at sub-millimeter ('terahertz') frequencies and they have been successfully used as pixels in several experimental imaging arrays at these wavelengths.\n\nIn these applications the lamps are operated either in 'starvation' mode (to reduce lamp-current noise) or in normal glow discharge mode; some literature references their use as detectors of radiation up into the optical regime when operated in abnormal glow mode. Coupling of microwaves into the plasma may be in free space, in waveguide, by means of a parabolic concentrator (e.g., Winston cone), or via capacitive means via a loop or dipole antenna mounted directly to the lamp.\n\nAlthough most of these applications use ordinary off-the-shelf dual-electrode lamps, in one case it was found{{by whom|date=October 2015}} that special 3 (or more) electrode lamps, with the extra electrode acting as the coupling antenna, provided even better results (lower noise and higher sensitivity). This discovery received an application patent (Kopeika et al.).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n=== Alphanumerical display ===\n[[Image:Nixie2.gif|thumb |right |The digits of a [[Nixie tube]]. |alt=Sequence of ten photograph of a glass tube.
