Typically, a hologram is a photographic recording of a [[light field]], rather than of an image formed by a [[Lens (optics)|lens]], and it is used to display a fully [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] image of the holographed subject, which is seen without the aid of [[Stereoscopy|special glasses or other intermediate optics]]. The hologram itself is not an image and it is usually unintelligible when viewed under [[Diffuse reflection|diffuse ambient light]]. It is an encoding of the light field as an [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] pattern of seemingly random variations in the opacity, density, or surface profile of the [http://www.hologram123.com photographic] medium. When suitably lit, the interference pattern [[Diffraction|diffracts]] the light into a reproduction of the original light field and the objects that were in it appear to still be there, exhibiting visual [[Depth perception|depth cues]] such as [[parallax]] and [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] that change realistically with any change in the relative position of the observer.\n\nIn its pure form, holography requires the use of [[laser]] light for illuminating the subject and for viewing the finished hologram. In a side-by-side comparison under optimal conditions, a holographic image is visually indistinguishable from the actual subject, if the hologram and the subject are lit just as they were at the time of recording. A microscopic level of detail throughout the recorded volume of space can be reproduced. In common practice, however, major image quality compromises are made to eliminate the need for laser illumination when viewing the hologram, and sometimes, to the extent possible, also when making it. Holographic portraiture often resorts to a non-holographic intermediate imaging procedure, to avoid the hazardous high-powered [[Laser#Pulsed operation|pulsed lasers]] otherwise needed to optically \"freeze\" living subjects as perfectly as the extremely motion-intolerant holographic recording process requires. Holograms can now also be entirely computer-generated and show objects or scenes that never existed.\n\nHolography should not be confused with [[lenticular lens|lenticular]] and other earlier [[autostereoscopy|autostereoscopic]] 3D display technologies, which can produce superficially similar results but are based on conventional lens imaging. Stage illusions such as [[Pepper's Ghost]] and other unusual, baffling, or seemingly magical images are also often incorrectly called holograms.\n\n==Overview and history==\nThe [[Magyars|Hungarian]]-[[British people|British]] physicist [[Dennis Gabor]] (in Hungarian: ''G\u00e1bor D\u00e9nes''),<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gabor | first1 = Dennis | authorlink = Dennis Gabor | year = 1948 | title = A new microscopic principle | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 161 | issue = | pages = 777\u20138 | doi=10.1038/161777a0|bibcode = 1948Natur.161..777G | pmid=18860291}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1098/rspa.1949.0075|first = Dennis|last = Gabor|year = 1949|title = Microscopy by reconstructed wavefronts|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society|location = London|volume = 197|pages = 454\u2013487|issue = 1051|postscript = <!--None-->|bibcode = 1949RSPSA.197..454G }}</ref> was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1971 \"for his invention and development of the holographic method\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1971/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1971 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref>\nHis work, done in the late 1940s, was built on pioneering work in the field of X-ray microscopy by other scientists including [[Mieczys\u0142aw Wolfke]] in 1920 and [[William Lawrence Bragg]] in 1939.<ref>Hariharan, (1996), Section 1.2, p4-5</ref> The discovery was an unexpected result of research into improving [[electron microscope]]s at the [[British Thomson-Houston]] (BTH) Company in [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], England, and the company filed a patent in December 1947 (patent GB685286).

The object in the hologram is a toy van. It is no more possible to discern the subject of a hologram from this pattern than it is to identify what music has been recorded by looking at a [[compact disc|CD]] surface. Note that the hologram is described by the [[speckle pattern]], rather than the \"wavy\" line pattern.]]\n\nHolography is a technique that enables a light field, which is generally the product of a light source scattered off objects, to be recorded and later reconstructed when the original light field is no longer present, due to the absence of the original objects.<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Section 1, p1</ref>  Holography can be thought of as somewhat similar to [[sound recording]], whereby a sound field created by vibrating matter like [[musical instrument]]s or [[vocal cords]], is encoded in such a way that it can be reproduced later, without the presence of the original vibrating matter.\n\n===Laser===\nIn laser holography, the hologram is recorded using a source of [[laser]] light, which is very pure in its color and orderly in its composition. Various setups may be used, and several types of holograms can be made, but all involve the interaction of light coming from different directions and producing a microscopically fine interference pattern which a [[photographic plate|plate]], film, or other medium [[photography|photographically]] records.\n\nIn one common arrangement, the laser beam is split into two, one known as the [[object beam]]<!-- the traditional term, despite the redirect that results --> and the other as the [[reference beam]]. The object beam is expanded by passing it through a lens and used to illuminate the subject. The recording medium is located where this light, after being reflected or scattered by the subject, will strike it. The edges of the medium will ultimately serve as a window through which the subject is seen, so its location is chosen with that in mind. The reference beam is expanded and made to shine directly on the medium, where it interacts with the light coming from the subject to create the  desired interference pattern.\n\nLike conventional photography, holography requires an appropriate [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] time to correctly affect the recording medium. Unlike conventional photography, during the exposure the light source, the optical elements, the recording medium, and the subject must all remain perfectly motionless relative to each other, to within about a quarter of the wavelength of the light, or the interference pattern will be blurred and the hologram spoiled. With living subjects and some unstable materials, that is only possible if a very intense and extremely brief pulse of laser light is used, a hazardous procedure which is rare and rarely done outside of scientific and industrial laboratory settings. Exposures lasting several seconds to several minutes, using a much lower-powered continuously operating laser, are typical.\n\n===Apparatus===\n\nA hologram can be made by shining part of the light beam directly into the recording medium, \nand the other part onto the object in such a way that some of the scattered light falls onto the recording medium.\n\nA more flexible arrangement for recording a hologram requires the laser beam to be aimed through a series of elements that change it in different ways. The first element is a [[beam splitter]] that divides the beam into two identical beams, each aimed in different directions:\n*One beam (known as the ''illumination'' or ''object beam'') is spread using [[Lens (optics)|lens]]es and directed onto the scene using [[mirror]]s. Some of the light scattered (reflected) from the scene then falls onto the recording medium.\n*The second beam (known as the ''reference beam'') is also spread through the use of lenses, but is directed so that it doesn't come in contact with the scene, and instead travels directly onto the recording medium.\n\nSeveral different materials can be used as the recording medium. One of the most common is a film very similar to [[photographic film]] ([[silver halide]] [[photographic emulsion]]), but with a much higher concentration of light-reactive grains, making it capable of the much higher [[Optical resolution|resolution]] that holograms require. A layer of this recording medium (e.g., silver halide) is attached to a transparent substrate, which is commonly glass, but may also be plastic.\n\n===Process===\nWhen the two laser beams reach the recording medium, their light waves intersect and [[Interference (wave propagation)|interfere]] with each other. It is this interference pattern that is imprinted on the recording medium. The pattern itself is seemingly random, as it represents the way in which the scene's light ''interfered'' with the original light source \u2014 but not the original light source itself. The interference pattern can be considered an [[encoded]] version of the scene, requiring a particular key \u2014 the original light source \u2014 in order to view its contents.\n\nThis missing key is provided later by shining a laser, identical to the one used to record the hologram, onto the developed film. When this beam illuminates the hologram, it is [[diffraction|diffracted]] by the hologram's surface pattern. This produces a light field identical to the one originally produced by the scene and scattered onto the hologram.\n\n===Vs. photography===\nHolography may be better understood via an examination of its differences from ordinary [[photography]]:\n\n* A hologram represents a recording of information regarding the light that came from the original scene as scattered in a range of directions rather than from only one direction, as in a photograph. This allows the scene to be viewed from a range of different angles, as if it were still present.\n* A photograph can be recorded using normal light sources (sunlight or electric lighting) whereas a laser is required to record a hologram.\n*A lens is required in photography to record the image, whereas in holography, the light from the object is scattered directly onto the recording medium.\n*A holographic recording requires a second light beam (the reference beam) to be directed onto the recording medium.\n* A photograph can be viewed in a wide range of lighting conditions, whereas holograms can only be viewed with very specific forms of illumination.\n* When a photograph is cut in half, each piece shows half of the scene. When a hologram is cut in half, the whole scene can still be seen in each piece. This is because, whereas each point in a [[photograph]] only represents light scattered from a single point in the scene, ''each point'' on a holographic recording includes information about light scattered from ''every point'' in the scene. It can be thought of as viewing a street outside a house through a {{convert|4|x|4|ft|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} window, then through a {{convert|2|x|2|ft|cm|-1|abbr=on|order=flip}} window. One can see all of the same things through the smaller window (by moving the head to change the viewing angle), but the viewer can see more ''at once'' through the {{convert|4|ft|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} window.\n* A photograph is a two-dimensional representation that can only reproduce a rudimentary three-dimensional effect, whereas the reproduced viewing range of a hologram adds many more [[Depth perception|depth perception cues]] that were present in the original scene. These cues are recognized by the [[human brain]] and translated into the same perception of a three-dimensional image as when the original scene might have been viewed.\n* A photograph clearly maps out the light field of the original scene. The developed hologram's surface consists of a very fine, seemingly random pattern, which appears to bear no relationship to the scene it recorded.\n\n==Physics of holography==\nFor a better understanding of the process, it is necessary to understand [[interference (optics)|interference]] and [[diffraction]]. Interference occurs when one or more [[wavefronts]] are superimposed. [[Diffraction]] occurs whenever a wavefront encounters an object. The process of producing a holographic reconstruction is explained below purely in terms of interference and diffraction. It is somewhat simplified but is accurate enough to provide an understanding of how the holographic process works.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with these concepts, it is worthwhile to read the respective articles before reading further in this article.\n\n===Plane wavefronts===\nA [[diffraction grating]] is a structure with a repeating pattern. A simple example is a metal plate with slits cut at regular intervals. A light wave incident on a grating is split into several waves; the direction of these diffracted waves is determined by the grating spacing and the wavelength of the light.\n\nA simple hologram can be made by superimposing two [[plane wave]]s from the same light source on a holographic recording medium. The two waves interfere giving a [[Interference (optics)#Between two plane waves|straight line fringe pattern]] whose intensity varies sinusoidally across the medium. The spacing of the fringe pattern is determined by the angle between the two waves, and on the wavelength of the light.\n\nThe recorded light pattern is a diffraction grating. When it is illuminated by only one of the waves used to create it, it can be shown that one of the diffracted waves emerges at the same angle as that at which the second wave was originally incident so that the second wave has been 'reconstructed'. Thus, the recorded light pattern is a holographic recording as defined above.\n\n===Point sources===\n[[File:Zonenplatte Cosinus.png|upright|thumb|Sinusoidal zone plate]]\nIf the recording medium is illuminated with a point source and a normally incident plane wave, the resulting pattern is a [[Zone plate|sinusoidal zone plate]] which acts as a negative [[Fresnel lens]] whose focal length is equal to the separation of the point source and the recording plane.\n\nWhen a plane wave-front illuminates a negative lens, it is expanded into a wave which appears to diverge from the focal point of the lens. Thus, when the recorded pattern is illuminated with the original plane wave, some of the light is diffracted into a diverging beam equivalent to the original spherical wave; a holographic recording of the point source has been created.\n\nWhen the plane wave is incident at a non-normal angle, the pattern formed is more complex but still acts as a negative lens provided it is illuminated at the original angle.\n\n===Complex objects===\nTo record a hologram of a complex object, a laser beam is first split into two separate beams of light. One beam illuminates the object, which then scatters light onto the recording medium. According to [[diffraction]] theory, each point in the object acts as a point source of light so the recording medium can be considered to be illuminated by a set of point sources located at varying distances from the medium.\n\nThe second (reference) beam illuminates the recording medium directly. Each point source wave interferes with the reference beam, giving rise to its own sinusoidal zone plate in the recording medium. The resulting pattern is the sum of all these 'zone plates' which combine to produce a random ([[speckle pattern|speckle]]) pattern as in the photograph above.\n\nWhen the hologram is illuminated by the original reference beam, each of the individual zone plates reconstructs the object wave which produced it, and these individual wavefronts add together to reconstruct the whole of the object beam. The viewer perceives a wavefront that is identical to the wavefront scattered from the object onto the recording medium, so that it appears to him or her that the object is still in place even if it has been removed.\n\n===Mathematical model===\nA single-frequency light wave can be modeled by a [[complex number]] '''U''', which represents the [[electric]] or [[magnetic field]] of the [[electromagnetic radiation#Properties|light wave]]. The [[amplitude]] and [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the light are represented by the [[Polar form|absolute value]] and [[Polar form|angle]] of the complex number. The object and reference waves at any point in the holographic system are given by '''U'''<sub>O</sub> and '''U'''<sub>R</sub>. The combined beam is given by '''U'''<sub>O</sub> + '''U'''<sub>R</sub>. The energy of the combined beams is proportional to the square of magnitude of the combined waves as:\n\n:<math>|U_O + U_R|^2=U_O U_R^*+|U_R|^2+|U_O|^2+ U_O^*U_R</math>\n\nIf a photographic plate is exposed to the two beams and then developed, its transmittance, '''T''', is proportional to the light energy that was incident on the plate and is given by\n\n:<math>T = kU_O U_R^* + k|U_R|^2 + k|U_O|^2 + kU_O^* U_R</math>\n\nwhere ''k'' is a constant.\n\nWhen the developed plate is illuminated by the reference beam, the light transmitted through the plate, '''U'''<sub>H</sub> is equal to the transmittance '''T''' multiplied by the reference beam amplitude '''U'''<sub>R</sub>, giving\n\n:<math>U_H = TU_R = kU_O|U_R|^2 + k|U_R|^2 U_R + k|U_O|^2 U_R + kU_O^* U_R^2</math>\n\nIt can be seen that '''U'''<sub>H</sub> has four terms, each representing a light beam emerging from the hologram. The first of these is proportional to '''U'''<sub>O</sub>. This is the reconstructed object beam which enables a viewer to 'see' the original object even when it is no longer present in the field of view.\n\nThe second and third beams are modified versions of the reference beam. The fourth term is known as the \"conjugate object beam\". It has the reverse curvature to the object beam itself and forms a [[real image]] of the object in the space beyond the holographic plate.\n\nWhen the reference and object beams are incident on the holographic recording medium at significantly different angles, the virtual, real and reference wavefronts all emerge at different angles, enabling the reconstructed object to be seen clearly.\n\n==Recording a hologram==\n\n===Items required===\n\n[[File:Holography setup.jpeg|thumb|An optical table being used to make a hologram]]\nTo make a hologram, the following are required:\n\n* a suitable object or set of objects\n* part of the laser beam to be directed so that it illuminates the object (the object beam) and another part so that it illuminates the recording medium directly (the reference beam), enabling the reference beam and the light which is scattered from the object onto the recording medium to form an interference pattern\n* a recording medium which converts this interference pattern into an optical element which modifies either the amplitude or the phase of an incident light beam according to the intensity of the interference pattern.\n* a laser beam that produces [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] light with one [[wavelength]].\n* an environment which provides sufficient mechanical and thermal stability that the interference pattern is stable during the time in which the interference pattern is recorded<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Section 7,1. p60</ref>\n\nThese requirements are inter-related, and it is essential to understand the nature of optical interference to see this. [[Interference (optics)|Interference]] is the variation in [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] which can occur when two [[light waves]] are superimposed. The intensity of the maxima exceeds the sum of the individual intensities of the two beams, and the intensity at the minima is less than this and may be zero. The interference pattern maps the relative phase between the two waves, and any change in the relative phases causes the interference pattern to move across the field of view. If the relative phase of the two waves changes by one cycle, then the pattern drifts by one whole fringe. One phase cycle corresponds to a change in the relative distances travelled by the two beams of one wavelength. Since the wavelength of light is of the order of 0.5&nbsp;\u03bcm, it can be seen that very small changes in the optical paths travelled by either of the beams in the holographic recording system lead to movement of the interference pattern which is the holographic recording. Such changes can be caused by relative movements of any of the optical components or the object itself, and also by local changes in air-temperature. It is essential that any such changes are significantly less than the wavelength of light if a clear well-defined recording of the interference is to be created.\n\nThe exposure time required to record the hologram depends on the laser power available, on the particular medium used and on the size and nature of the object(s) to be recorded, just as in conventional photography. This determines the stability requirements. Exposure times of several minutes are typical when using quite powerful gas lasers and silver halide emulsions. All the elements within the optical system have to be stable to fractions of a \u03bcm over that period. It is possible to make holograms of much less stable objects by using a [[Laser pulse|pulsed laser]] which produces a large amount of energy in a very short time (\u03bcs or less).<ref>Martinez-Hurtado et al. {{doi|10.1021/la102693m}}</ref> These systems have been used to produce holograms of live people. A holographic portrait of Dennis Gabor was produced in 1971 using a pulsed ruby laser.<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Figure 4.5, p44</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://webmuseum.mit.edu/browser.php?m=objects&kv=67243&i=14558|title = Photograph of Dennis Gabor standing beside his holographic portrait |publisher=MIT|accessdate= 2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\nThus, the laser power, recording medium sensitivity, recording time and mechanical and thermal stability requirements are all interlinked. Generally, the smaller the object, the more compact the optical layout, so that the stability requirements are significantly less than when making holograms of large objects.\n\nAnother very important laser parameter is its [[Coherence (physics)#Temporal coherence|coherence]].<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Section 4.2, p40</ref>  This can be envisaged by considering a laser producing a sine wave whose frequency drifts over time; the coherence length can then be considered to be the distance over which it maintains a single frequency. This is important because two waves of different frequencies do not produce a stable interference pattern. The coherence length of the laser determines the depth of field which can be recorded in the scene. A good holography laser will typically have a coherence length of several meters, ample for a deep hologram.\n\nThe objects that form the scene must, in general, have optically rough surfaces so that they scatter light over a wide range of angles. A specularly reflecting (or shiny) surface reflects the light in only one direction at each point on its surface, so in general, most of the light will not be incident on the recording medium. A hologram of a shiny object can be made by locating it very close to the recording plate.<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Figure 7.2, p62</ref>\n\n===Hologram classifications===\n\nThere are three important properties of a hologram which are defined in this section. A given hologram will have one or other of each of these three properties, e.g. an amplitude modulated thin transmission hologram, or a phase modulated, volume reflection hologram.\n\n====Amplitude and phase modulation holograms====\n\nAn amplitude modulation hologram is one where the amplitude of light diffracted by the hologram is proportional to the intensity of the recorded light. A straightforward example of this is [[photographic emulsion]] on a transparent substrate. The emulsion is exposed to the interference pattern, and is subsequently developed giving a transmittance which varies with the intensity of the pattern \u2013 the more light that fell on the plate at a given point, the darker the developed plate at that point.\n\nA phase hologram is made by changing either the thickness or the [[refractive index]] of the material in proportion to the intensity of the holographic interference pattern. This is a [[Grating equation|phase grating]] and it can be shown that when such a plate is illuminated by the original reference beam, it reconstructs the original object wavefront. The efficiency (i.e., the fraction of the illuminated object beam which is converted into the reconstructed object beam) is greater for phase than for amplitude modulated holograms.\n\n====Thin holograms and thick (volume) holograms====\n\nA thin hologram is one where the thickness of the recording medium is much less than the spacing of the interference fringes which make up the holographic recording.\n\nA thick or [[volume hologram]] is one where the thickness of the recording medium is greater than the spacing of the interference pattern. The recorded hologram is now a three dimensional structure, and it can be shown that incident light is diffracted by the grating only at a particular angle, known as the [[Bragg's law|Bragg angle]].<ref>Lipson, (2011), Seection12.5.4, p443</ref> If the hologram is illuminated with a light source incident at the original reference beam angle but a broad spectrum of wavelengths; reconstruction occurs only at the wavelength of the original laser used. If the angle of illumination is changed, reconstruction will occur at a different wavelength and the colour of the re-constructed scene changes. A volume hologram effectively acts as a colour filter.\n\n====Transmission and reflection holograms====\nA transmission hologram is one where the object and reference beams are incident on the recording medium from the same side. In practice, several more mirrors may be used to direct the beams in the required directions.\n\nNormally, transmission holograms can only be reconstructed using a laser or a quasi-monochromatic source, but a particular type of transmission hologram, known as a rainbow hologram, can be viewed with white light.\n\nIn a reflection hologram, the object and reference beams are incident on the plate from opposite sides of the plate. The reconstructed object is then viewed from the same side of the plate as that at which the re-constructing beam is incident.\n\nOnly volume holograms can be used to make reflection holograms, as only a very low intensity diffracted beam would be reflected by a thin hologram.\n\n===Holographic recording media===\n\nThe recording medium has to convert the original interference pattern into an optical element that modifies either the [[amplitude]] or the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of an incident light beam in proportion to the intensity of the original light field.\n\nThe recording medium should be able to resolve fully all the fringes arising from interference between object and reference beam. These fringe spacings can range from tens of [[micrometers]] to less than one micrometer, i.e. spatial frequencies ranging from a few hundred to several thousand cycles/mm, and ideally, the recording medium should have a response which is flat over this range. If the response of the medium to these spatial frequencies is low, the diffraction efficiency of the hologram will be poor, and a dim image will be obtained. Standard photographic film has a very low or even zero response at the frequencies involved and cannot be used to make a hologram \u2013 see, for example, Kodak's professional black and white film<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kodak.com/eknec/documents/59/0900688a80300559/EpubBW400CN4036.pdf|title=Kodak black and white professional film&#124;|accessdate = 2011-09-14}}</ref> whose resolution starts falling off at 20 lines/mm \u2014 it is unlikely that any reconstructed beam could be obtained using this film.\n\nIf the response is not flat over the range of spatial frequencies in the interference pattern, then the resolution of the reconstructed image may also be degraded.<ref>Hariharan, (1996), Section 6.4, p88</ref><ref>Kozma A & Zelenka JS, (1970), Effect of film resolution and size in holography, Journal of the Optical Society of America, 60, 34\u201343</ref>\n\nThe table below shows the principal materials used for holographic recording. Note that these do not include the materials used in the [[Holography#Mass replication of holograms|mass replication]] of an existing hologram, which are discussed in the next section. The resolution limit given in the table indicates the maximal number of interference lines/mm of the gratings. The required exposure, expressed as milli[[joule]]s (mJ) of photon energy impacting the surface area, is for a long exposure time. Short exposure times (less than {{frac|1|1000}} of a second, such as with a pulsed laser) require much higher exposure energies, due to [[reciprocity failure]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ General properties of recording materials for holography<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Table 6.1, p50</ref>\n|-\n!

Embossing, which is similar to the method used to stamp out plastic discs from a master in audio recording, involves copying this surface relief pattern by impressing it onto another material.\n\nThe first step in the embossing process is to make a stamper by [[Electrophoretic deposition|electrodeposition]] of [[nickel]] on the relief image recorded on the photoresist or photothermoplastic. When the nickel layer is thick enough, it is separated from the master hologram and mounted on a metal backing plate. The material used to make embossed copies consists of a [[polyester]] base film, a resin separation layer and a [[thermoplastic]] film constituting the holographic layer.\n\nThe embossing process can be carried out with a simple heated press. The bottom layer of the duplicating film (the thermoplastic layer) is heated above its softening point and pressed against the stamper, so that it takes up its shape. This shape is retained when the film is cooled and removed from the press. In order to permit the viewing of embossed holograms in reflection, an additional reflecting layer of aluminum is usually added on the hologram recording layer. This method is particularly suited to mass production.\n\nThe first book to feature a hologram on the front cover was ''The Skook'' (Warner Books, 1984) by [[JP Miller]], featuring an illustration by Miller. That same year, \"Telstar\" by [[Ad Infinitum (band)|Ad Infinitum]] became the first record with a hologram cover and ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' published the first magazine with a hologram cover.<ref>http://press.nationalgeographic.com/about-national-geographic/milestones/</ref> Embossed holograms are used widely on credit cards, banknotes, and high value products for authentication purposes.<ref>Toal Vincent, 2012, Introcution to Holography, CRC Press, ISBN 978-1-4398-1868-8</ref>\n\nIt is possible to print holograms directly into steel using a sheet explosive charge to create the required surface relief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news124039000.html |title=Holograms with explosive power |publisher=Physorg.com |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> The [[Royal Canadian Mint]] produces holographic gold and silver coinage through a complex stamping process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mint.ca/store/coin/150-lunar-hologram-coin-year-of-the-rabbit-2011-prod990012|title = Lunar Holographic Coins|accessdate = 2011-09-14}}</ref>\n\nA hologram can be copied optically by illuminating it with a laser beam, and locating a second hologram plate so that it is illuminated both by the reconstructed object beam, and the illuminating beam. Stability and coherence requirements are significantly reduced if the two plates are located very close together.<ref>Harris JR, Sherman GC and Billings BH, 1966, Copying hologram, Applied Optics, 5, 665\u20136</ref>  An [[refractive index|index]] matching fluid is often used between the plates to minimize spurious interference between the plates.  Uniform illumination can be obtained by scanning point-by-point or with a beam shaped into a thin line.\n\n==Reconstructing and viewing the holographic image==\nWhen the hologram plate is illuminated by a laser beam identical to the reference beam which was used to record the hologram, an exact reconstruction of the original object wavefront is obtained. An imaging system (an eye or a camera) located in the reconstructed beam 'sees' exactly the same scene as it would have done when viewing the original. When the lens is moved, the image changes in the same way as it would have done when the object was in place. If several objects were present when the hologram was recorded, the reconstructed objects move relative to one another, i.e. exhibit [[parallax]], in the same way as the original objects would have done. It was very common in the early days of holography to use a chess board as the object and then take photographs at several different angles using the reconstructed light to show how the relative positions of the chess pieces appeared to change.\n\nA holographic image can also be obtained using a different laser beam configuration to the original recording object beam, but the reconstructed image will not match the original exactly.<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Section 2.3, p17</ref> When a laser is used to reconstruct the hologram, the image is [[speckle pattern|speckled]] just as the original image will have been. This can be a major drawback in viewing a hologram.\n\nWhite light consists of light of a wide range of wavelengths. Normally, if a hologram is illuminated by a white light source, each wavelength can be considered to generate its own holographic reconstruction, and these will vary in size, angle, and distance. These will be superimposed, and the summed image will wipe out any information about the original scene, as if superimposing a set of photographs of the same object of different sizes and orientations. However, a holographic image can be obtained using [[Electromagnetic spectrum#Visible radiation .28light.29|white light]] in specific circumstances, e.g. with volume holograms and rainbow holograms. The white light source used to view these holograms should always approximate to a point source, i.e. a spot light or the sun. An extended source (e.g. a fluorescent lamp) will not reconstruct a hologram since its light is incident at each point at a wide range of angles, giving multiple reconstructions which will \"wipe\" one another out.\n\nWhite light reconstructions do not contain speckles.\n\n===Volume holograms===\n{{main|Volume hologram}}\nA reflection-type volume hologram can give an acceptably clear reconstructed image using a white light source, as the hologram structure itself effectively filters out light of wavelengths outside a relatively narrow range. In theory, the result should be an image of approximately the same colour as the laser light used to make the hologram. In practice, with recording media that require chemical processing, there is typically a compaction of the structure due to the processing and a consequent colour shift to a shorter wavelength. Such a hologram recorded in a silver halide gelatin emulsion by red laser light will usually display a green image. Deliberate temporary alteration of the emulsion thickness before exposure, or permanent alteration after processing, has been used by artists to produce unusual colours and multicoloured effects.\n\n===Rainbow holograms===\n{{main|Rainbow hologram}}\n[[File:Rainbow hologram.jpeg|thumb|Rainbow hologram showing the change in colour in the vertical direction]]\nIn this method, parallax in the vertical plane is sacrificed to allow a bright, well-defined, [[color gradient|gradiently colored]] reconstructed image to be obtained using white light. The rainbow holography recording process usually begins with a standard transmission hologram and copies it using a horizontal slit to eliminate vertical [[parallax]] in the output image. The viewer is therefore effectively viewing the holographic image through a narrow horizontal slit, but the slit has been expanded into a window by the same [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] that would otherwise smear the entire image. Horizontal parallax information is preserved but movement in the vertical direction results in a color shift rather than altered vertical perspective.<ref>Hariharan, (2002), Section 7.4, p63</ref> Because perspective effects are reproduced along one axis only, the subject will appear variously stretched or squashed when the hologram is not viewed at an optimum distance; this distortion may go unnoticed when there is not much depth, but can be severe when the distance of the subject from the plane of the hologram is very substantial. [[Stereopsis]] and horizontal motion parallax, two relatively powerful cues to depth, are preserved.\n\nThe holograms found on [[credit cards]] are examples of rainbow holograms. These are technically transmission holograms mounted onto a reflective surface like a [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|metalized polyethylene terephthalate]] substrate commonly known as [[polyethylene terephthalate|PET]].\n\n===Fidelity of the reconstructed beam===\n[[File:broken hologram.jpg|thumb|Reconstructions from two parts of a broken hologram. Note the different viewpoints required to see the whole object]]\nTo replicate the original object beam exactly, the reconstructing reference beam must be identical to the original reference beam and the recording medium must be able to fully resolve the interference pattern formed between the object and reference beams.<ref>S. Koreshev, A. Gromov, O. Nikanorov, [http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/journal/120/journal_120.htm \"Modernized Software Complex for Synthesis and Reconstruction of Fresnel Holograms-Projectors\"], Scientific and Technical Journal of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics, Number 6, Volume 12, 2012</ref> Exact reconstruction is required in [[holographic interferometry]], where the holographically reconstructed wavefront [[Interference (wave propagation)|interferes]] with the wavefront coming from the actual object, giving a null fringe if there has been no movement of the object and mapping out the displacement if the object has moved. This requires very precise relocation of the developed holographic plate.\n\nAny change in the shape, orientation or wavelength of the reference beam gives rise to aberrations in the reconstructed image. For instance, the reconstructed image is magnified if the laser used to reconstruct the hologram has a shorter wavelength than the original laser. Nonetheless, good reconstruction is obtained using a laser of a different wavelength, quasi-monochromatic light or white light, in the right circumstances.\n\nSince each point in the object illuminates all of the hologram, the whole object can be reconstructed from a small part of the hologram. Thus, a hologram can be broken up into small pieces and each one will enable the whole of the original object to be imaged. One does, however, lose information and the [[optical resolution|spatial resolution]] gets worse as the size of the hologram is decreased \u2014 the image becomes \"fuzzier\". The field of view is also reduced, and the viewer will have to change position to see different parts of the scene.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Art===\nEarly on, artists saw the potential of holography as a medium and gained access to science laboratories to create their work. Holographic art is often the result of collaborations between scientists and artists, although some holographers would regard themselves as both an artist and a scientist.\n\n[[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] claimed to have been the first to employ holography artistically. He was certainly the first and best-known surrealist to do so, but the 1972 New York exhibit of Dal\u00ed holograms had been preceded by the holographic art exhibition that was held at the [[Cranbrook Academy of Art]] in Michigan in 1968 and by the one at the Finch College gallery in New York in 1970, which attracted national media attention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://holophile.com/history.htm |title=The History and Development of Holography|publisher=Holophile.com |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> In Great Britain, [[Margaret Benyon]] began using holography as an artistic medium in the late 1960s and had a solo exhibition at the [[University of Nottingham]] art gallery in 1969.<ref name=Coyle>{{Cite book| publisher = John Libbey and Company| isbn = 0-86196-266-4| pages = 65\u201388| editors = Philip Hayward (ed.)| last = Coyle| first = Rebecca| title = Culture, Technology & Creativity in the Late Twentieth Century| chapter = Holography \u2013 Art in the space of technology| location = London, England| date = 1990| chapterurl = https://books.google.ca/books?id=yLq3rM2at3cC&pg=PA67}}</ref> This was followed in 1970 by a solo show at the [[Lisson Gallery]] in London, which was billed as the \"first London expo of holograms and stereoscopic paintings\".<ref name=\"poster\">{{cite web|title=Margaret Benyon Holography|url=http://www.lissongallery.com/exhibitions/margaret-benyon|website=Lisson Gallery|accessdate=4 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1970s, a number of art studios and schools were established, each with their particular approach to holography. Notably, there was the San Francisco School of Holography established by [[Lloyd Cross]], The Museum of Holography in New York founded by Rosemary (Posy) H. Jackson, the Royal College of Art in London and the [[Lake Forest College]] Symposiums organised by [[Tung Jeong]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Integraf |url=http://www.integraf.com/tung_jeong.htm |title=Dr. Tung J. Jeong Biography |publisher=Integraf.com |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> None of these studios still exist; however, there is the Center for the Holographic Arts in New York<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holocenter.org |title=holocenter |publisher=holocenter |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> and the HOLOcenter in Seoul,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holocenter.or.kr/ |title=Holocenter |publisher=Holocenter |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> which offers artists a place to create and exhibit work.\n\nDuring the 1980s, many artists who worked with holography helped the diffusion of this so-called \"new medium\" in the art world, such as Harriet Casdin-Silver of the United States, [[Dieter Jung (artist)|Dieter Jung]] of Germany, and [[Moys\u00e9s Baumstein]] of [[Brazil]], each one searching for a proper \"language\" to use with the three-dimensional work, avoiding the simple holographic reproduction of a sculpture or object. For instance, in Brazil, many concrete poets (Augusto de Campos, D\u00e9cio Pignatari, Julio Plaza and Jos\u00e9 Wagner Garcia, associated with [[Moys\u00e9s Baumstein]]) found in holography a way to express themselves and to renew [[Concrete Poetry]].\n\nA small but active group of artists still integrate holographic elements into their work.<ref>http://www.universal-hologram.com/</ref>  Some are associated with novel holographic techniques; for example, artist Matt Brand<ref>Holographic metalwork http://www.zintaglio.com</ref> employed computational mirror design to eliminate image distortion from [[specular holography]].\n\nThe MIT Museum<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/museum/collections/holography.html |title=MIT Museum: Collections \u2013 Holography |publisher=Web.mit.edu |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> and Jonathan Ross<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrholocollection.com/ |title=The Jonathan Ross Hologram Collection |publisher=Jrholocollection.com |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> both have extensive collections of holography and on-line catalogues of art holograms.\n\n===Data storage===\n{{Main|Holographic memory}}\n\nHolography can be put to a variety of uses other than recording images. [[Holographic data storage]] is a technique that can store information at high density inside crystals or photopolymers. The ability to store large amounts of information in some kind of medium is of great importance, as many electronic products incorporate storage devices. As current storage techniques such as [[Blu-ray Disc]] reach the limit of possible data density (due to the [[diffraction]]-limited size of the writing beams), holographic storage has the potential to become the next generation of popular storage media. The advantage of this type of data storage is that the volume of the recording media is used instead of just the surface.\nCurrently available [[spatial light modulator|SLMs]] can produce about 1000 different images a second at 1024\u00d71024-bit resolution. With the right type of medium (probably polymers rather than something like [[lithium niobate|LiNbO<sub>3</sub>]]), this would result in about one-[[gigabit per second|gigabit-per-second]] writing speed. Read speeds can surpass this, and experts believe one-[[terabit per second|terabit-per-second]] readout is possible.\n\nIn 2005, companies such as [[Optware]] and [[Maxell]] produced a 120&nbsp;mm disc that uses a holographic layer to store data to a potential 3.9&nbsp;[[terabyte|TB]], a format called [[Holographic Versatile Disc]]. As of September 2014, no commercial product has been released.\n\nAnother company, [[InPhase Technologies]], was developing a competing format, but went bankrupt in 2011 and all its assets were sold to Akonia Holographics, LLC.\n\nWhile many holographic data storage models have used \"page-based\" storage, where each recorded hologram holds a large amount of data, more recent research into using submicrometre-sized \"microholograms\" has resulted in several potential [[3D optical data storage]] solutions. While this approach to data storage can not attain the high data rates of page-based storage, the tolerances, technological hurdles, and cost of producing a commercial product are significantly lower.\n\n===Dynamic holography===\nIn static holography, recording, developing and reconstructing occur sequentially, and a permanent hologram is produced.\n\nThere also exist holographic materials that do not need the developing process and can record a hologram in a very short time. This allows one to use holography to perform some simple operations in an all-optical way. Examples of applications of such real-time holograms include [[phase-conjugate mirror]]s (\"time-reversal\" of light), optical cache memories, [[image processing]] (pattern recognition of time-varying images), and [[optical computing]].\n\nThe amount of processed information can be very high (terabits/s), since the operation is performed in parallel on a whole image. This compensates for the fact that the recording time, which is in the order of a [[microsecond]], is still very long compared to the processing time of an electronic computer. The optical processing performed by a dynamic hologram is also much less flexible than electronic processing. On one side, one has to perform the operation always on the whole image, and on the other side, the operation a hologram can perform is basically either a multiplication or a phase conjugation. In optics, addition and [[Fourier transform]] are already easily performed in linear materials, the latter simply by a lens. This enables some applications, such as a device that compares images in an optical way.<ref>R. Ryf et al. [http://ol.osa.org/abstract.cfm?id=65530 High-frame-rate joint Fourier-transform correlator based on Sn<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>6</sub> crystal], Optics Letters '''26''', 1666\u20131668 (2001)</ref>\n\nThe search for novel [[:Category:Nonlinear optical materials|nonlinear optical materials]] for dynamic holography is an active area of research. The most common materials are [[photorefraction|photorefractive crystals]], but in [[semiconductor]]s or [[Heterojunction|semiconductor heterostructures]] (such as [[quantum well]]s), atomic vapors and gases, [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]] and even liquids, it was possible to generate holograms.\n\nA particularly promising application is [[optical phase conjugation]]. It allows the removal of the wavefront distortions a light beam receives when passing through an aberrating medium, by sending it back through the same aberrating medium with a conjugated phase. This is useful, for example, in free-space optical communications to compensate for atmospheric turbulence (the phenomenon that gives rise to the twinkling of starlight).\n\n===Hobbyist use===\n[[File:Contest3.jpg|thumb|''Peace Within Reach'', a Denisyuk DCG hologram by amateur Dave Battin]]\n\nSince the beginning of holography, amateur experimenters have explored its uses.\n\nIn 1971, [[Lloyd Cross]] opened the San Francisco School of Holography and taught amateurs how to make holograms using only a small (typically 5&nbsp;mW) [[helium-neon laser]] and inexpensive home-made equipment. Holography had been supposed to require a very expensive metal [[optical table]] set-up to lock all the involved elements down in place and damp any vibrations that could blur the interference fringes and ruin the hologram. Cross's home-brew alternative was a [[sandpit|sandbox]] made of a [[cinder block]] retaining wall on a plywood base, supported on stacks of old tires to isolate it from ground vibrations, and filled with sand that had been washed to remove dust. The laser was securely mounted atop the cinder block wall. The mirrors and simple lenses needed for directing, splitting and expanding the laser beam were affixed to short lengths of PVC pipe, which were stuck into the sand at the desired locations. The subject and the [[photographic plate]] holder were similarly supported within the sandbox. The holographer turned off the room light, blocked the laser beam near its source using a small [[relay]]-controlled shutter, loaded a plate into the holder in the dark, left the room, waited a few minutes to let everything settle, then made the exposure by remotely operating the laser shutter.\n\nMany of these holographers would go on to produce art holograms. In 1983, Fred Unterseher, a co-founder of the San Francisco School of Holography and a well-known holographic artist, published the ''Holography Handbook'', an easy-to-read guide to making holograms at home. This brought in a new wave of holographers and provided simple methods for using the then-available AGFA [[silver halide]] recording materials.\n\nIn 2000, [[Frank DeFreitas]] published the ''Shoebox Holography Book'' and introduced the use of inexpensive [[laser pointer]]s to countless [[hobby]]ists. For many years, it had been assumed that certain characteristics of semiconductor [[laser diodes]] made them virtually useless for creating holograms, but when they were eventually put to the test of practical experiment, it was found that not only was this untrue, but that some actually provided a [[coherence length]] much greater than that of traditional helium-neon gas lasers. This was a very important development for amateurs, as the price of red laser diodes had dropped from hundreds of dollars in the early 1980s to about $5 after they entered the mass market as a component of [[DVD]] players in the late 1990s. Now, there are thousands of amateur holographers worldwide.\n\nBy late 2000, holography kits with inexpensive laser pointer diodes entered the mainstream consumer market. These kits enabled students, teachers, and hobbyists to make several kinds of holograms without specialized equipment, and became popular gift items by 2005.<ref name=\"IEEE\">Stephen Cass: ''[http://spectrum.ieee.org/consumer-electronics/gaming/holiday-gifts-2005 Holiday Gifts 2005 Gifts and gadgets for technophiles of all ages: Do-It Yourself-3-D]''. In ''IEEE Spectrum'', November 2005</ref> The introduction of holography kits with self-developing [[photographic plate|plates]] in 2003 made it possible for hobbyists to create holograms without the bother of wet chemical processing.<ref name=\"physicsteacher\">Chiaverina, Chris: ''[http://www.litiholo.com/Hologram%20Kit%20article%20Physics%20Teacher%20Nov%202010.pdf Litiholo holography \u2013 So easy even a caveman could have done it (apparatus review)]''. In ''The Physics Teacher'', vol. 48, November 2010, pp. 551\u2013552.</ref>\n\nIn 2006, a large number of surplus holography-quality green lasers (Coherent C315) became available and put dichromated gelatin (DCG) holography within the reach of the amateur holographer. The holography community was surprised at the amazing sensitivity of DCG to green [[light]]. It had been assumed that this sensitivity would be uselessly slight or non-existent. Jeff Blyth responded with the G307 formulation of DCG to increase the speed and sensitivity to these new lasers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holowiki.com/index.php/G307_DCG_Formula |title=A Holography FAQ |publisher=HoloWiki |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref>\n\nKodak and AGFA, the former major suppliers of holography-quality silver halide plates and films, are no longer in the market. While other manufactures have helped fill the void, many amateurs are now making their own materials. The favorite formulations are dichromated gelatin, Methylene-Blue-sensitised dichromated gelatin, and diffusion method silver halide preparations. Jeff Blyth has published very accurate methods for making these in a small lab or garage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holowiki.com/index.php/Special:Search?search=Blyth&go=Go |title=Many methods are here |publisher=Holowiki.com |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref>\n\nA small group of amateurs are even constructing their own pulsed lasers to make holograms of living subjects and other unsteady or moving objects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cabd0.tripod.com/holograms/index.html |title=Jeff Blyth's Film Formulations |publisher=Cabd0.tripod.com |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref>\n\n===Holographic interferometry===\n{{Main|holographic interferometry}}\n\nHolographic interferometry (HI) is a technique that enables static and dynamic displacements of objects with optically rough surfaces to be measured to optical interferometric precision (i.e. to fractions of a wavelength of light).<ref>Powell RL & Stetson KA, 1965, J. Opt. Soc. Am., 55, 1593\u20138</ref><ref>Jones R and Wykes C, Holographic and Speckle Interferometry, 1989, Cambridge University Press ISBN 0-521-34417-4</ref> It can also be used to detect optical-path-length variations in transparent media, which enables, for example, fluid flow to be visualized and analyzed. It can also be used to generate contours representing the form of the surface.\n\nIt has been widely used to measure stress, strain, and vibration in engineering structures.\n\n===Interferometric microscopy===\n{{Main|Interferometric microscopy}}\n\nThe hologram keeps the information on the amplitude and phase of the field. Several holograms may keep information about the same distribution of light, emitted to various directions. The numerical analysis of such holograms allows one to emulate large [[numerical aperture]], which, in turn, enables enhancement of the resolution of [[optical microscopy]]. The corresponding technique is called [[interferometric microscopy]]. Recent achievements of interferometric microscopy allow one to approach the quarter-wavelength limit of resolution.<ref name=\"U1\">{{Cite journal\n|url=http://www.opticsexpress.org/abstract.cfm?id=134719\n| author=Y.Kuznetsova\n|author2=A.Neumann, S.R.Brueck\n| title=Imaging interferometric microscopy\u2013approaching the linear systems limits of optical resolution\n| journal=[[Optics Express]]\n| volume=15\n| pages=6651\u20136663\n| year=2007\n| doi=10.1364/OE.15.006651\n|bibcode = 2007OExpr..15.6651K\n| pmid=19546975\n|issue=11}}</ref>\n\n===Sensors or biosensors===\n{{Main|Holographic sensor}}\n\nThe hologram is made with a modified material that interacts  certain molecules generating a change in the fringe periodicity or refractive index, therefore, the color of the holographic reflection.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=AK Yetisen |author2=H Butt |author3=F da Cruz Vasconcellos |author4=Y Montelongo |author5=CAB Davidson |author6=J Blyth |author7=JB Carmody |author8=S Vignolini |author9=U Steiner |author10=JJ Baumberg |author11=TD Wilkinson |author12=CR Lowe |title=Light-Directed Writing of Chemically Tunable Narrow-Band Holographic Sensors |journal= Advanced Optical Materials |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=250\u2013254 |year=2013 |doi= 10.1002/adom.201300375 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Mart\u00edNez-Hurtado | first1 = J.

They are used widely in many [[currency|currencies]], such as the [[Brazilian real|Brazilian]] 20, 50, and 100-reais notes; [[Pound sterling|British]] 5, 10, and 20-pound notes; [[South Korean won|South Korean]] 5000, 10,000, and 50,000-won notes; [[Japanese yen|Japanese]] 5000 and 10,000 yen notes, India 50,100,500, and 1000 rupee notes; and all the currently-circulating banknotes of the [[Canadian dollar]], [[Danish krone]], and [[Euro]]. They can also be found in credit and bank cards as well as [[passport]]s, ID cards, [[book]]s, [[DVD]]s, and [[sports equipment]].\n\nCovertly storing information within a full colour image hologram was achieved in Canada, in 2008, at the UHR lab. The method used a fourth wavelength, aside from the RGB components of the object and reference beams, to record additional data, which could be retrieved only with the correct key combination of wavelength and angle. This technique remained in the prototype stage and was never developed for commercial applications.\n\n===Other applications===\nHolographic scanners are in use in post offices, larger shipping firms, and automated conveyor systems to determine the three-dimensional size of a package. They are often used in tandem with [[checkweigher]]s to allow automated pre-packing of given volumes, such as a truck or pallet for bulk shipment of goods.\nHolograms produced in elastomers can be used as stress-strain reporters due to its elasticity and compressibility, the pressure and force applied are correlated to the reflected wavelength, therefore its color.<ref>'Elastic hologram' pages 113\u2013117, Proc. of the IGC 2010, ISBN 978-0-9566139-1-2 here: http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/225960</ref>\n\n'''[[Fast-moving consumer goods|FMCG]] industry'''\n\nThese are the hologram adhesive strips that provide protection against counterfeiting and duplication of products. These protective strips can be used on FMCG products like cards, medicines, food, audio-visual products etc. Hologram protection strips can be directly laminated on the product covering.\n\n==== Electrical and electronic products ====\nHologram tags have an excellent ability to inspect an identical product. These kind of tags are more often used for protecting duplication of electrical and electronic products. These tags are available in a variety colors, sizes and shapes.\n\n==== Hologram dockets for vehicle number plate ====\nSome vehicle number plates on bikes or cars have registered hologram stickers which indicate authenticity. For the purpose of identification they have unique ID numbers.\n\n==== High security holograms for credit cards ====\n[[File:Credit-cards.jpg|alt=Holograms on credit cards|thumb|Notice the Hologram sticker engraved on the credit card.]]\nThese are holograms with high security features like micro texts, nano texts, complex images, logos and a multitude of other features. Holograms once affixed on Debit cards/passports cannot be removed easily. They offer an individual identity to a brand along with its protection.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Non-optical==\nIn principle, it is possible to make a hologram for any [[wave]].\n\n[[Electron holography]] is the application of holography techniques to electron waves rather than light waves. Electron holography was invented by Dennis Gabor to improve the resolution and avoid the aberrations of the [[transmission electron microscope]]. Today it is commonly used to study electric and magnetic fields in thin films, as magnetic and electric fields can shift the phase of the interfering wave passing through the sample.<ref>R. E. Dunin-Borkowski et al., Micros. Res. and Tech. vol. 64, pp. 390\u2013402 (2004)</ref> The principle of electron holography can also be applied to [[interference lithography]].<ref>K. Ogai et al., Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., vol. 32, pp.5988\u20135992 (1993)</ref>\n\n[[Acoustic holography]] is a method used to estimate the sound field near a source by measuring acoustic parameters away from the source via an array of pressure and/or particle velocity transducers. Measuring techniques included within acoustic holography are becoming increasingly popular in various fields, most notably those of transportation, vehicle and aircraft design, and NVH. The general idea of acoustic holography has led to different versions such as near-field acoustic holography (NAH) and statistically optimal near-field acoustic holography (SONAH). For audio rendition, the wave field synthesis is the most related procedure.\n\n''Atomic holography'' has evolved out of the development of the basic elements of [[atom optics]]. With the Fresnel diffraction lens and [[atomic mirror (physics)|atomic mirrors]] atomic holography follows a natural step in the development of the physics (and applications) of atomic beams. Recent developments including [[atomic mirror (physics)|atomic mirrors]] and especially [[ridged mirror]]s have provided the tools necessary for the creation of atomic holograms,<ref name=\"holo\">{{Cite journal| title = Reflection-Type Hologram for Atoms | author = F.

The video image displayed on the floor is reflected in an angled sheet of glass.]]\nThe Pepper's ghost technique, being the easiest to implement of these methods, is most prevalent in 3D displays that claim to be (or are referred to as) \"holographic\". While the original illusion, used in theater, involved actual physical objects and persons, located offstage, modern variants replace the source object with a digital screen, which displays imagery generated with [[3D computer graphics]] to provide the necessary [[depth perception|depth cues]]. The reflection, which seems to float mid-air, is still flat, however, thus less realistic than if an actual 3D object was being reflected.\n\nExamples of this digital version of Pepper's ghost illusion include the [[Gorillaz]] performances in the [[2005 MTV Europe Music Awards#Performances|2005 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and the [[48th Grammy Awards#Performances|48th Grammy Awards]]; and [[Tupac Shakur]]'s virtual performance at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] in 2012, rapping alongside [[Snoop Dogg]] during his set with [[Dr. Dre]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/16/tupac-returns-as-a-hologram-at-coachella/ |title=Tupac returns as a hologram at Coachella |work=The Marquee Blog \u2013 CNN.com Blogs |publisher=CNN |date= 16 April 2012|accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref>\n\nAn even simpler illusion can be created by [[Video projector|rear-projecting]] realistic images into semi-transparent screens. The rear projection is necessary because otherwise the semi-transparency of the screen would allow the background to be illuminated by the projection, which would break the illusion.\n\n[[Crypton Future Media]], a music software company that produced [[Hatsune Miku]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crypton.co.jp/mp/pages/prod/vocaloid/ |publisher=Crypton.co.jp |accessdate=2012-04-21}}</ref> one of many [[Vocaloid]] singing synthesizer applications, has produced concerts that have Miku, along with other Crypton Vocaloids, performing on stage as  \"holographic\" characters.
